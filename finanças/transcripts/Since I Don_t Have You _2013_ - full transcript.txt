(energetic piano music) (somber reflective music) - Dad? (sobbing) - You have no idea what I've been through. No fucking idea. She was (sobbing). She was driving me crazy. They were all driving me crazy. I gave your mom the drugs to help. To help her. They let her sleep, they kept her up but then she needed them and after awhile, so did I. (sobbing) I just couldn't take it anymore. She was afraid, I was afraid. Our lives imploded. Jesus, I hope you never know what the fuck that's like. - Dad, Dad please just put down the gun. We can work this out. This is fucking crazy. - No! Its time (crowd cheering) - All right, alright, all right. Are you ready for song time? I said are you ready for song time? It is indeed a great pleasure of mine to introduce at this particular time fresh off their national caravan loop put your hands together for the Skyliners. (soft rock music) - They're white? These suckers are white. (vocalizing) - [Narrator] The Skyliners released their single "Since I Don't Have You" the day after Christmas in 1958. It went gold immediately and changed their lives forever. In addition to "Since I Don't Have You" the Skyliners are released "This I Swear" "Tired of Me", "Lonely Way" and more, solidifying their place in music history all before the British Invasion. And then, after all that, they just stopped. But in the 70s, they realized they loved being together, singing, performing, and to some extent they even loved touring. The first time I ever saw The Skyliners perform was in 1976 and that is where this story really begins. - This is fucking bullshit. - Kerry, calm down. - Calm down, how am I supposed to calm down? You didn't even realize I'm out there. - I have to go out for the encore. (pounding at door) - I tell you when you go on. - Not so hard, you're hurting me. - I saw you, Janie, you winked at him. - Kerry, I was having a good time. You set me up and by the way, he pays for your lifestyle. So calm down. - Hey bud, looking good, looking good. How you feeling? - Okay, I guess. - Got your camera? Big night tonight. What are you still back here, though? - Mom and dad are still in the dressing room. - What? Jan, let's go. - Hey Dad, can I sit with Grandma and Gramp? 'cause I want to film the show. - Yeah sure, let's go. (crowd cheering) - Don't you know them, let's bring them back out. Pittsburgh very own, The Skyliners. (cheering) - Hi everyone, I'm sorry but somehow it always seems to take us a little longer to do our hair and makeup than we expect, doesn't it ladies? (applause) And gentlemen, I don't look like this 24 hours a day. I know it may seem like it right now but.

They were like newlyweds. They constantly went on dates just to celebrate being together. They really seemed to love each other during those times. My dad didn't have to share my mom. She wasn't under any pressure. She could just be herself. I really wish those summers would of lasted longer. (radio in background) - Kerry? Kerry? - Shit. I'll be out in a minute. - [Janet] We have a grade orientation at the school. - Hey, I'm gonna play with Gramp's camera. - Okay, honey. Hey, give me a kiss. Kerry? Hey. - Hey. - [Janet] What you doing? - Counting mother's little helpers. - Oh, I need some. I'm feeling a little after that school visit. - Take this. (film reel clicking) - I can see you. - So what you guys doing? - Hey while the kids are downstairs playing, I've got to call Joe about a gig. - You got to call Joe about a gig? How about let's not and say that you did, okay? (laughing) Why don't we do this instead? This is a much better idea. I missed you. - Not taking anymore of this bullshit, Joe. I'm not. - He's not coming this time, Jimmy, you know that, relax. - Does Jan know that yet? - Jan knows it. Listen, Jimmy, you don't know the half of this shit. - Yeah, what could be worse than being a complete dick to us and holding Jan hostage whenever he feels like it? - Well for one thing, he wants us to pick up his plane tickets. - What? - And then he wants us to pay for his salary for the time he's off and then he wants us to pay for a baby sitter, which is his mother. So when he comes it's double, everything is double. - For Christ sake, Joe, this has got to stop. Wally and Joe want to quit because of this jag off. - I know, I know. - My shot? - He's not coming and that's it, all right? I'll call Jan right now to make sure she understands. (phone ringing) Hello, is Jan there? (radio in background) (phone ringing) Hey asshole, put your wife on the phone. - Fucking asshole. Babe, get up. Phones for you, he keeps calling back. - Hello? - Hey Jan, its Joe, how you doing? We were wondering how you were, how are the kids, how's everything over there? - Yeah, everything's fine, Joe. - Good, we were wondering if you had told Kerry that he's not coming on this trip. - Uh, I'm gonna take care of that later, Joe. - Not too much later we hope, Jan. Jimmy's blowing a fuse over here. Wally and Joey V. are ready to quit. You know, we all have to be on the same page here, Jan. - Okay, okay Joe. - Okay, babe. We appreciate that. We are counting on you. - Don't worry. - Thanks. - He doesn't know yet. - What the hell was that all about? - Just info for the tour. (game buzzing) (kid laughing) - Damn it, Marlo. - Get Mom. - No, you get her this time. - Come on, Gavin. - Ugh, fine. Kip, make sure she keeps that on her face. - Hey, wasn't that my piece? (muttering) - We talked about this. I go with you or you don't go. We had a deal, I don't trust them. They pay me to protect you and them. Jan, listen. - Kerry. They don't want you around anymore. They don't like you messing with the staff and bothering the waitresses and they don't like you making sure the girls see you watch your dirty movies backstage. Imagine that. - Mom, Dad. Marlo's nose is bleeding again. - I'll go. - No, I'll go. - Fine. - Okay, well why don't you and Kippy go up and get a Popsicle? It will cool you off, be good for your nosebleed. Okay? - Okay. - Come on, Kip. - Hey, Marlo, wipe your nose, okay. - Mom, why did Dad push you? (Jan sighs) - Come here. He's just frustrated, honey, cause mom's got to go on the road again for awhile. - But you just got home. - I know, it won't be right away. It will be in a couple weeks. - But I'm starting a new school again in a couple of weeks. - And I'll be there, you'll see. Everything's gonna be fine. - I thought we were gonna be together for awhile. - We are but then I have to go back to sing for a little bit. - But why? - Gavin, you know I love you. You're so important to me. I care about you so much. This is the last big tour for a long time. I won't have to sing much after this. We'll be able to pay for this house. We'll have lots of time to hang out together. I just have to do this one more thing and we'll be all set. Okay? (water running) - [Kerry] Not taking me on tour, huh? We'll see. (laughing) Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, and fuck you. (Walkie talkie chatter) hey, hey, hey turn this on. What the hell are you doing in here? - I was, I was just. Dad, what are these? - Gavin, do not ever go in here. These are your mothers. You go in this bag again I will ground you for life. - Is she gonna be ready by the time-- - Yeah she's gonna be ready. Shut up, you're gonna wake her up. Now go get Marlo and Kip. Now. Oh come here. (laughing) How you doing? I'm gonna miss you. I got to go to work. Kippy's waiting for me in the car, okay? I'm taking him to a friends house and he's spending the night. Now Mom's gonna take you guys to school. Mem, when you hear the alarm go off can you please make sure she's up? You got it? - Yes. - Okay, and Gavin, wait for her at school. Come home together, okay? - Yup. - All right, love you. See ya, buddy. (alarm ringing) - (distorted echos) Mom, Mom come on. Wake up, we got to go to school. - (distorted echos) Mom, come on. - mom, mom, let's go. We have to go, we have to go. - What are we gonna do? - Let's just walk. Come on, I know the way.

(upbeat early rock) Come on. - Come on, you're gonna let your little sister beat you? - Oh my god. - Marlo! (music distorts and slows) Marlo! - Don't, don't move her. Don't move, what was she doing on the tracks? What where you guys coming from? Where do you live at? - Up, up there, over the hill. I need my mom. - Go get your mom, I'll be here with her. Go get your mom. (somber music) - Mom, Mom come on, you need to get up. Mom come on, get up. Marlo got hit by a trolley. Come on. Mom, mom get up. We need to help her. Mom. - My baby. (sobbing) no, no. (sirens in distance) Help! Help. Help, somebody. Come on. Please help. (sobbing) - [Radio] Officer Rapp, 572. - Officer Rapp. - [Radio] We have report that your daughter was involved in an accident with a trolley. She's at at Jefferson Hospital right now. The captain says you should proceed to that 1020, immediately. Take care, buddy. Hope everything's okay. - I'm on my way. (somber music) - Mrs. Rapp, can I see you for a minute, please? We've looked at the x-rays, nothings broken. Just a few minor abrasions. She's a lucky girl. Is that your husband? - Jesus Christ. - Where have you been? We've all be worried sick. I was out all day from the sleeping pills you gave me. If it weren't for Gavin Marlo would probably dead. - This is your fault. - What? - I gave you an upper this morning, it should have kicked in. You know what, be a mother, be a star. You can't be both, okay, and it shows. (slap lands) - You're the one that wants me to be a star. The kids want me to be a mother. Christ, what do you want me to do? If I go to a party or I talk to a fan, you go nuts. You're such a paranoid son of a bitch. - You know what? - I can't keep living like this anymore. - Fuck you. - [Gavin] Mom, Dad. - Hey. - Gavin can stay here with Kerry but Marlo and Kip, I just don't have the... Kerry's mom? Over my dead body. Please, CC, please. You've got to help me. - Oh god. Okay. - Oh my god. Oh CC, thanks so much. You're a life saver. I just, I just. I don't even know how to thank... Oh, uh, hi Gav. I didn't see you there. Shit. Hey sis, I got to go. Yeah, okay. Hey, thanks. Bye. - Who was that? - Aunt CC. Gavin, come here. I'm gonna take Marlo and Kip over to stay at her place for awhile and you're gonna stay here with Dad. You know, just the guys. - Dad was right, huh? - About what, honey? - You love your singing more than you love us. - Oh Gavin, oh come here, honey. You know I love you. More than anything. And I'll always be with you no matter where I am. Always, always. - How long will they be gone? - I don't know. Listen, things aren't working out with me and your mom, again. I don't think we're gonna be together anymore. Mommy doesn't love me, this house or anything right now. (upbeat early rock music) - [Narrator] I figured that my dad and I would just make the best of it and we did, we had a really good time together. We played football and I'd pretend I was the Steelers and he was the Raiders. My dad really wanted me to do well in school so he helped me with my homework. He was going to night school, too, so we few nights a week we worked together at the dining room table. We tried to be together as much as we could, even if it was just doing our homework, I didn't care. After the holidays came and went, I figured it was gonna be like this from now on. Just me and my dad. Which was fine with me. I loved my dad and I thought he was the coolest guy in the world. But I still really missed my mom and Marlo and Kippy a lot. I wondered if I'd ever see them again. (upbeat early rock music) - [Answering Machine] Kerry, hi. I know its been some time but listen, I'm going on another tour. I don't know when I'm gonna get back but I just, I want just wanted to say that I love you. I love Gavin. But I'm gonna need a little more time. I've just been having a real rough go of it and I think about you and I think about Gavin. So I uh, listen I, I got to go. I just need some time. CC has the information on the tour and I just wanted you to know I'll see you later. I love you, Gavin. Bye. (urinating) (fleshy thumping) (person groaning) - Dad? (metal clatters) (coughing) Fuck, Dad! Dad, Dad. (groaning and panting) (somber reflective piano music) - So, they're telling me he took strychnine. - Yeah, if Gavin hadn't found him he wouldn't be with us. - Unbelievable. - Excuse me, I have to take this. - Sure. Listen, kiddo. Your dad is real sick. He needs to stay here for awhile. You're gonna come and stay with me. Come on. (somber reflective music) There you go. Try to get some sleep. We'll get some things sorted out in the morning. Marlo and Kip will be happy to see you. Goodnight. (somber reflective piano music) - All right, children. One more show tonight, four more next week and then we rest a little bit. How bout right here, is that okay? And then Cleveland. - Nice. (phone ringing) - Hello? - Jan, it's CC. Look, I don't know how to tell you this so I'm just gonna say it straight up. Kerry tried to kill himself last night. - Oh my god. - He took strychnine. - Can you hold on? Guys, I gotta talk to CC. Can we pick this up later? I'll be up in a little bit. Order some room service. - He's at Jefferson Hospital. He's in a private room. It was really bad, almost fatal. Gavin found him and called the police. Doctor says he's gonna be okay. - How's Gav? - He's been a trooper, Jan. Yeah. Listen, I enrolled him in a school down the street. I can't have another kid staying home with me all day. Oh, I'll go crazy. Jesus, Gavin, you scared the shit out of me. Cigarette, hon. It's your mom, you want to say hi? - Hi, Mom. - Hi honey, how are you? - Okay, I guess. I really miss you. - Do you like staying at Aunt CC's? - Not really. Mom, listen, Dad's really sick. When are you gonna be home? - Oh soon, honey, soon. Be strong. Mom's gotta go rehearse for the show now but I'll see you soon. I love you. - Jan, can you send some flowers to Kerry? He's at Jefferson. - Yeah, yeah I'll send him some flowers. Listen, Cees, I'll talk to you later, okay? Okay, bye. - Your mom, the rockstar. - Hi. - Nice flowers. - Of course they are, they're for you. - Thank you. - Oh it is so good to see you. - How do you feel? - Better now that you're here. - Let's get out of here.

Just need you to sign right here. - [Jan] What is this? - [Kerry] It's just stuff for school. - I'm not signing this. What the hell's the matter with you? Nurse. - Listen. (muffled cries) You're gonna sign it, you're gonna sign, I'm gonna take Gavin and you will never ever see him again, do you hear me? I am sick and tired of being ignored, Jan. I protected you and them. They want to cast me aside and you, too? No, you know you're never there for me anymore and you're not there for the kids, either. Let's take a step in the right direction for a change, okay. Just sign the fucking papers. - I would rather die. (soft rock and roll playing in background) - [Kerry Voiceover] You love your singing more than you love us. I'm gonna take Gavin and you will never ever see him again. Do you hear me? - [Joe Voiceover] Look, you're really vulnerable right now. You're really vulnerable right now so don't him manipulate you. I don't know what else to say.

Where's Aunt CC? - She went to the hospital to visit you. - Why would she go to the hospital? Where's Gavin? - Mom, he's at school. - I need to pick up Gavin Rapp. I need to pick up Gavin Rapp, he's my son. - Ma'am, may I please see some I.D.? - Oh damn it. Just, where is he? I need him. - Please, Please. Calm down. - I need him and I will not calm down. Just, where is he? I need him, I need him now. - Mom, Kip is crying for you in the car. - Where is he? - Calm down. - I will not calm down. - Mom, Kip is crying for you in the car. - Where is he? - Ma'am, all of the children have been dismissed for the day. - You could of told me that sooner. Come on out of here. - Are we visiting Grandma Rapp? - No, Grandma's visiting your uncle in Florida. - Is Mom here then? Are we seeing Mom? - Listen, Mom isn't well. - What do you mean? - She is a bit crazy right now. - What are you talking about? - Why do you think she left you behind? - She wouldn't do that. - Yeah, well she did, Gavin. Okay, we have to stick together on this one. Come on, man. Look, I already enrolled you in a new school. It's gonna be a new start for us. I need you with us on this one, Kemosabe. Are you with me? Come on, let's go. (bell ringing) - Gentlemen, gentlemen, this is Gavin Rapp and Gavin Rapp comes to us from the far reaches of the South Hills. How 'bout a nice central welcome for Gavin? (kids saying hi) - Hi. - [Kerry Voiceover] Hey, Gav, hope you had a good day today. I made a sandwich for you in the fridge. I'll be home later on tonight. Love you. (clock chiming) (pounding at door) - [Joe] Kerry, you fucking bastard! - She'll be out in a minute. - Please, Kerry. Come on, honey. The kids are waiting outside. - I love you.

They're the only saving grace you've got left. (somber reflective music) - Gav. Listen. I thought that in some crazy way if I kept all her stuff she wouldn't go on the road again. I know, I know but I don't know what else to do right now. I mean... I think your mom wants to leave me, us, and if I don't do something, that's what she'll do. It's just all so complicated. You don't want Mom to leave us, do you? - Dad, I don't want to do this anymore. - Hey thanks, Joe. I really appreciate it. This time I just want to get my son. Oh I know where he is, all right. Anytime Kerry has any problems, he runs home to his mother. I'm sure they're staying at her place. No, she's in Florida. If we're lucky, Gavin will just be there by himself. Okay, Joe.

Jan, listen. - Stop, I'm sleeping. - Everybody's counting on you tomorrow, its a big day. You have to take your pills. - Stop. - Oh Jesus. Okay. Shit! - Would you keep it down, please? - They're already down. (laughing) (Jan shushes) Take some of these, here. I wiped them off. - Stop it. - Jan, Jan. - No. - Damn it, Kerry. (Kerry mumbling) Asshole. - These things are getting harder to open. (Jan shushes) Take some of these. - No, I'm not doing this tonight. Go sleep it off somewhere. - Shit. (dog barking) You fucking woke up the damn dogs. Take the fucking pills. Take the fucking, take the fucking pills. (groaning) (dogs barking) Take the fucking pills. (somber piano music) - [Kerry Voiceover] Take the fucking pills. Take the fucking pills! - [Jan Voiceover] Get off of me. - [Kerry Voiceover] Take them. Now do what I tell you! - [Jan Voiceover] Go sleep it off somewhere. - Take the fucking pills! - Kerry. I'm not doing this. Go sleep it off somewhere I don't know how people do it. Day in day out. Same routine. God. - [Kerry Voiceover] Why do you think she left you behind? (somber piano music) (dogs barking) (somber music) (coughing) - Hello? Mom? Mom. (somber tense music) Mom? (coughing) (engine sputtering) Mom? Mom! (coughing) (distorted rock music) - In the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost, amen. Please, everyone, let's bow our heads for Jan and pray for her forgiveness. Do not stand at my grave and weep. I am not there. I do not sleep. I am the sunlight on the ripened grain, I am the gently falling Autumn rain. Do not stand at my grave and cry, I am not there, I did not die. May Jan and all the souls of the faithfully departed through the mercy of God, rest in peace. Amen. In the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost, amen. (crowd chattering) - Hey listen, listen. I know you did this, you son of a bitch. Now if I could I'd fucking kill you right now-- - You did this, yeah you and your fuck ups. I did my best to save her. - You did shit. - Your ruined my life. Get the fuck out of my sight. - Jan, no! Please, wake up. Please. - Get off her, you son of a bitch. What the hells wrong with you? - Leave him be. - She's my wife! - Not anymore. - [Narrator] Over the next five years, all of us kids missed my mom. My dad moved his mother and sister in to help us. I graduated from Central Catholic High School and miraculously got accepted at the University of Pittsburgh. Marlo graduated from Saint Paul's and started at Duquesne. And Kippy was about to finish high school early with honors and start at Penn State. When my dad's mother died, his sister moved out, quick and my dad sold the house. My dad married Peggy. What a joy. He wanted to start a new life with or without us but I'd say mostly without us. - Okay, here's the deal. Now that Peggy and I are married, we're a new family. This is our new house. The three of you have a room to stay in upstairs and you're each gonna get a key to the front door. That's it. - But, Dad, I don't have a car. My part time job is in the South Hills. How am I gonna get to work? - Gavin, you're old enough now that if you don't want to stay here you can get a place of your own. Or you could take a fucking bus. - A bus from Edgewood to Brentwood? Yeah right. - Hey, lump it or leave it. Marlo's taking the bus to school. Kippy's gonna finish school right down here on Maple Street. - But I don't know anyone there. - But what difference does that make? No ones gonna talk to you anyway because you're an Oriental. - Why do we have to move, anyway? - You know what, I'm not listening to this. - I can't take this shit anymore. I got to get the hell out of here. - What about us? - Well, you guys can come with me but I got to tell you if we leave here there's no going back. - Well I say we're in. - [Narrator] We went to the only person I could think of who would take us in. My mothers' mom, Gram. We got on a bus and we didn't look back. (upbeat early rock) We had always loved Gram, she was wonderful. She supported all of us during that very turbulent time and never complained about more food or more flushes or any of that bullshit. She was a rock, a foundation everyone needed to take a step forward. Our grandpa had died shortly after my mom so Gram was happy to have people in the house again. My dad never called. Not once. (phone ringing) - [Answering Machine] Department of Healthy and Safety for the University. Please leave a message. - Dad, uh, I know we haven't talked in over a year but I told you not to marry Peggy. It would only break us apart. Yeah. I can't believe I'm saying this but we needed to stay together, we had to be strong. Shit. - I'll get it. - Thanks, Gram. (soft early rock) - [Gram] Gavin, you have a visitor. - Hey Gram, just tell him I'm busy. - Too busy for Joey Rock? - Holy shit. - Its showtime, kid. Look at this guy. Gosh. - It's been years. - Great to see you. Look, he's a grown man. - Oh its good to see you, too. - Look and he looks like his mom. Wow. - Thanks, man. - Hey. - So what brings you here? - Um-- - You staying for dinner? - That's what brings me here. Mom's home cooking. I come back just for that. - Yeah, I bet. - Why, you better. - And I got a call from Jimmy Beaumont and I need to talk to you about a couple of things. Is that all right? - Yeah sure. - Sure, yeah. You want to go out on the patio, talk? I'll stay in here and cook. - It sounds like heaven. (laughing) - Let's go outside. - Home cooking. - Can't beat that. - Okay, so look, this is the Holiday House, 1958. - Oh my gosh. - See how gorgeous your mom is? - That's awesome. - That's like a prom dress. She used to wear on stage. I know, she's a baby doll, she always looked great on stage. Always right on the money. Listen, man, you're um, you're getting your mom's royalty checks, right? - What from the Skyliners? - Yeah, from our songs that they play on the radio. Your supposed to be getting your mom's share. Aw man, that's what I was afraid of. I bet you never saw anything from your mom's estate, either did you? - No but didn't really surprise me. It took me a long time to realize who knows if I even came to terms with it yet but I don't think my mom really cared about us that much. - God damn it, Gavin, don't say that. Your mom loved you guys and she left you nearly a million bucks plus royalties. Are you telling me you never saw any of that? Oh man. Do you remember that day your mom and I came to that apartment in Brooklyn to get you? - Yeah. - Why do you think she did that? - Well my dad said she had to come back 'cause she needed money. - No, she was making more money than your dad, much more. She came back because she loved you and Marlo and Kippy. She was willing to go back with your prick father just so she could be with you and all the time he was using her to fuck with us. You know, he forced us to pay him to come on tour with us for protection, as if Joey fucking Rock needed protection. He took all the money your mom made and spent it and then we always thought he was getting rough with her, too, but she would never talk about that. - But Joe, if all that's true, why didn't you guys try to stop him? - We did try. You know once I even set it up to look like we were going on a big tour just so your mom could get away from your dad for awhile. That's when he faked that damn suicide. - What? - Yeah, you knew that, right? - How could I know that? I was like 11. - Gavin, he did it when you were home 'cause you knew you'd be there to save him. That's how that son of a bitch operates! Look, I'm sorry, man. You don't even know what you're up against, do you? Look. When was the last time you talked to him? - I don't know, like a year ago. The day we left. I call him all the time but he hasn't returned any of my calls. - Yeah sure, 'cause he doesn't want you to find out what he did. This is crazy, man. You know, your mom wanted you to have what she left you kids. This is bullshit, man. Absolutely. This is, she would of not liked what is going down. - What can I even do at this point? You know, Marlo said that he's gonna retire and move to Florida. - Well you're gonna have to move fast, man. You tell him you talked to me and I told you about the pills and the strychnine and the money and the royalties and everything. Then maybe that will get him worried enough to start talking a little bit. - Can you help me? - Listen, man, if I see your old man again I'm gonna shoot him like 100 times in the head and Joey Rock's too old to go to jail anymore. - I don't care what you do, I'm done with him. I don't ever want to see him again. As soon as I can get out of here, I'm gone. No offense, Gram. - Hey Gram, where's Kippy? I told him I wanted to have meeting tonight. - Oh he called earlier. He said he was meeting his friends at the mall, the arcade. He said whatever you want to do is fine with him. He never wants to see his dad or Peggy again. - That's my dad. - Your dad, what? - Dad! Dad! Dad. Dad. I just want to talk to you. - Yeah, about what? - Well Joe Rock came to see me at Grams. He told me some pretty fucked up things. - Look, I'm busy. What do you want? - Come on, I think you know. - I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about. - Really? No idea about the drugs you used to give Mom-- - Nope, no idea. - Oh really, nothing about that green bag? - You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. - So nothing about the money she left us? - What money? There's no money. - Oh come on, Dad, the royalties. - You want a royalty? Okay. Here's your fucking royalty. Okay, there's no money. Get over it! - Nothing about how Mom died? - No. Nothing. You have no idea the shit your mother put me through. - The shit she put you through. Are you fucking kidding me? - You have no fucking idea. - Ah Jesus, you're such a fucking liar. - Don't you dare talk to me that way. I'm still your father. - Yeah. When its convenient. I know this plaque. - You've seen that before. - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah I've seen that before. It's a plaque from the publisher thanking you for helping with the song Since I Don't Have You. - No shit. I don't think I need you to tell me what it is. - No, I think you do, Dad, because that plaque really isn't from the publisher. The guys in The Skyliners had it made up and sent to you. - That's a lie. You're pathetic. - You're a pathetic. They wanted you to think it was from the publisher so you can have a thank you for something you really didn't even do. So you can stop being such an asshole. - Bullshit, that's real. Your mother would of told me. All the fights we had. She'd of make sure I knew that one. - No, Dad. I said the guys in The Skyliners. They never even told her. - Bullshit. Bullshit. I protected them. Every single one of them and I got nothing but grief from every one of them including your mother. You know what? Fuck 'em fuck 'em all. Jimmy Beaumont and The Skyliners are over. Fucking musics over, too. What, you get together with Joe Rock and he tells you some stories, right? And you actually believed him? You believe that fucking guy? Well good for you, Gavin. You know what, we're done here. Get the fuck out. Get on with your new fucking life. Before I call my security and have you escorted out. - You know you and your new fucking life can go to hell. - You forgot your fucking royalty! Fuck!

The tax returns showed he never declared any of the income that came to him from the royalties and with the bullshit bankruptcy document you got from the hall of records, I think we have him right where we want him. This goes out tomorrow. Unless you want to deliver it. - [Peggy] Baby, get the door. - Come on. - What? - Look, I just want to give you these. They're from the house in Brentwood, I looked through them and they've been kind of helpful. - [Peggy] Who is it, Ker? - Nobody. - Cute. You'll be getting a letter from my attorney and probably one from the Feds as well. - Get the hell out of here you son of a bitch. - Stop, stop, stop. - Look, Dad, I hate to do this. - Get the hell out of here. - You don't answer my calls, you won't meet me to talk-- - He doesn't owe you anything! He doesn't owe you a damn thing. - I'm not gonna let you leave us behind. - Leave us alone. Leave us alone. - Fuck you. (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Kerry] Gav. - Dad? - [Kerry] Everything's signed. Meet me tomorrow at the back of the university shipping and receiving offices six PM. I'll give you everything then. - Hey uh, keep an eye on us. You never know what might happen at the last minute. - [Walkie Talkie] We got you covered, Kerry. - Dad? (sobbing) - You have no idea what I've been through. No fucking idea. (mumbling) She was driving me crazy. They were all driving me crazy. I gave your mom the drugs to help her. To help her. It let her sleep, they kept her up but then she needed them and after awhile, so did I. I just couldn't take it anymore. She was afraid, I was afraid. Our lives imploded. Jesus, I hope you never know what the fuck that's like. - Dad, Dad, please just put down the gun. We can work this out, this is fucking crazy. - No, it's time. (gun cocks) (heart beating) (gunshot) (somber reflective music) - I forgive you. I forgive you. I forgive you.
