THE PRIEST'S CHILDREN Praise the Lord. I'm ?imun, the chaplain. Dr Babi? sent me about your operation. I told Babi? l won't have an abortion. Get out! You're the father? - And the mother. Just a minute, you mean that you're... - Pregnant? Doesn't it show? Well, you shouldn't smoke if you're pregnant. But how was the child conceived? - What do you want? A confession? Confession is our holy sacrament. - Give me a break. Just go home. - Don't be silly. - Why? It's dangerous. It could happen to you too. So you insist, eh? Alright then! Just don't say l didn't warn yo... In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. One beautiful sunny day l arrived on the island right after my First Mass. I was taking over from Father Jakov. First l was the curate, and then l became the parish priest. But the parishioners petitioned the bishop, so Father Jakov stayed on and he took mass every third Sunday. Lord, l surrender to You l dedicate my life to You l surrender my soul To Your pure love You are the way and truth He ran the children's choir and played veterans football. Yeaaah, goal! I don't know anything about football. He played boules with the locals. I'm no good at sports. He sang in the local a capella group, nearly winning the Dalmatian festival twice. Unfortunately, l am tone deaf. During Easter, there was always a longer line in front of his confessional than in front of mine. Everyone loved him. But l didn't like that. He wasn't doing a job of a priest. The island was dying. Since my arrival l signed 22 in the book of people who passed away and no one in the book of the newly born. There were fewer and fewer true believers. People were only interested in personal pleasure, and they forgot about their souls. And there was nothing l could do. All until one confession. Where are you going? - I'll come back next time. The line is too long. - Well, go to Father Fabijan then. But his penances are always too long. - Well, wait then. Easy. Hello, Mr. Mate. - Huh? - Can l go before you? I have to get back to work, my goods are coming. No cutting of the line, l have to confess as well. - I'll be quick. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. - Amen. Forgive me Father for l have sinned. I've not confessed since last Easter. There isn't a lot. I just curse. - Who do you curse? - Everyone. Mostly God and Jesus. Now and then the Virgin Mary. I know it's not very Christian but l can't control myself. Any other sins? My wife Marta says l kill people. Sorry? What do you do? - I kill people. What do you mean? - With that rubber. What rubber? - The one you put on a man's thing. Condoms. I see what you mean. But how do you kill people with that? I kill them before they're born. Hey there! Are you done yet? Please be patient. This is a holy sacrament, the man's confessing. We're in a hurry too, he skipped the line. - Everyone will get their turn. Go on... - I don't think it's much of a sin. I work in the kiosk so l have to sell them, or I'll lose my job. But Marta says that the Pope said it's a sin and l have to confess. How many have you sold so far? God knows. To foreigners in the summer and locals all year round. I don't know who sleeps with a woman without one. As far as l'm concerned l never put one on. I've always done it inside my Marta. But she's not fertile anyway. How long's this been going on? I've been coming inside her since we got married. She never gets pregnant. I meant, how long have you been selling them? Oh. More and more every year. I always have to order more. So tell me, Father, is it a sin to sell them or not? Come on, Mate, it's your turn. Come on, get up. You asleep? Wake up, come on. My God, he's dead! It's your fault he didn't receive the sacrament! Look everyone, he's dead! I told you those condoms kill people. ...and dear Mate, as mayor, l thank you for forming our island's Partisan navy and fighting against fascist invaders. We remember how you attacked German battleships and submarines with little tiny boats. Hitler's navy feared to sail near our island knowing you were here. Rest in peace in our Croatian soil and may you have calm seas up in heaven. Hey, wait. Stop! - What happened? My uncle died. - But his funeral is tomorrow. I know, but he's started to smell. I can't keep him in the house. Better to get it over with while we're all here than to come back tomorrow. That fucking tire and fucking nail! Luk?a! Now you've fallen! The bloody tire killed you twice! Oh dear brother Luk?a... Those smell like strawberries. Good for blowjobs. Because of the taste. Those are for men who have small dicks. For those with dicks up to nine centimeters. Those are ribbed. They say they're mostly for fucking in the ass. Can you stop using such filthy words? There are other ways of saying it. Those are for people with... a penis bigger than 25 cm. The only one who buys those, is Jure, the waiter at The Two Sardines. That's how l know he has... the biggest table-leg on the whole island. The type doesn't matter. What does matter is the middle of the wrapper. That's where the tip of the condom is. That stops the semen from coming out. You just need to prick a hole here with a thin needle and... Get it? No one can see the hole and it gives the semen freedom of movement. If it's God's will, a child will be conceived; if it's not, it won't. But thanks to us, whoever uses it, he won't be committing a sin. This way you won't be committing a sin either, and you won't get fired. You're trouble, trouble, trouble. - Damn, you scared me. Woman all alone at home. You shat in your pants, shat. It was, war, war. God has punished you, coward! Your sperm's all watery. - Come off it, Ana, go and sunbathe. Go away, the beach's over there. - I know, you're up to no good. Trouble, trouble. Ana knows. You fooled the government, you can't fool me. I'll come in the morning before work to pick up the ones with holes. And, don't say anything to anyone. Especially not to Father Jakov. Give me a newspaper and, you know... It's good to have some fun, Mayor. They say, it's like you're not even wearing one, that's how thin they are. Sold out, come back tomorrow. Hello, teacher! Here. How's my little cousin Stipe doing in school? Here, I've brought you a new batch. I had no idea they'd sell so quickly. People always fuck more during the holidays. And before marriage too. Sky, sky, nice weather, sea, sky, sky. Where did you find her? - On the beach, sunbathing. Jesus cures people, you don't! Pray for yourself, Father, not me. Jesus cures, Jesus. You have eyes but do not see. I pray for you. Alleluia! STJEPAN - TRUMPET GIRL This is very complicated. This is how things stand in the last 15 days. Stjepan, Luka's boy, the pyrotechnician, visits his parents every other weekend. While he's here, he fucks... ...meets up with that little trumpet girl. His parents really don't like it. Just look at them! Vice ?panji?, the policeman, meets Tripun's widow Mara in the same way. {Y:i}Oh, what if my late husband's watching! Pave's boy is all over the place. With who? - You should know, he confesses to yo... But according to my calculations, he could be with three, at least. I'm afraid one could be the daughter of Ga?i Bedri, our pastry maker. It'll be dangerous if he knocks her up. You know what Albanian traditions are like. You dishonored my daughter! And my favored: Mikula the cripple. - Who's he doing it with? He's... ...driving around with his ex, Verica whose dad works in the harbor. She stopped going out with him after he was crippled. No way she wants to marry a cripple. But they still fuck. We need to check that out immediately. POLICEMAN, POSTMAN, JURE - I don't know for these three. I investigated, but discovered nothing. VINKO THE TEACHER A special case. I don't know about him. Three kids, a pregnant wife, but he bought two boxes in the last 10 days. Vanilla flavored. Maybe he has to because his wife's pregnant... ...or something. I don't know. He can't have another baby with her when she's pregnant! I'm afraid he might be a... - What? Pedophile... - Excuse me? - Bye! - Goodbye. ...new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out... for you and for many... for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me. The secret of our faith. He's gone outside. He's looking at the children. Hello... Father. He's looking at the graveyard. What do you call people who have a thing for the dead? He's looking at the goats. How do you call those people who have a thing for pets? Hello. Mistake. He doesn't like pets. See here. They were together for two hours. They used up three of our condoms. My battery ran out so l couldn't film it all. Weird thing is, one runs the Christian Democrats, the other - the Socialists. So you put holes in all of them? - Yes. We sold everyone the ones with holes, except to the mayor and the teacher. Petar sold them the thickest ones he had. And? Were there any results? Nothing. Not one wedding or pregnancy in 3 months, but eight deaths. The dead bell was constantly ringing. Maybe we should make bigger holes. The size of the holes is not the problem, Marin is the problem. He sells the same condoms but without holes. We only cover half the market. We'll have to talk to him. There's no talking to him. - Why? - He's crazy. - Huh? He was with the medical corps in Bosnia and captured twice. He spent half a year in a Serb camp and half in a Muslim one. Then the UN found him. They didn't know who he was, so they deported him to some foreign country. There he spent two months proving he's a Croat. Not Muslim. - Prove it. Now he doesn't like foreigners. His pharmacy was nearly shut down because he didn't want to sell medicine to some people he thought were Serbs. They let him stay only because there was no one to replace him. Still, we should talk to him. So, our holes campaign did not give us proper results. You're crazy. I'm surprised at you, Father. I thought you're a serious priest, reasonable and thoughtful. But you and Petar... You're completely nuts. You're doing all this without me? We should join forces! It will be worse than you think. When we die out, Muslims and the Orthodox will move in. A mosque will replace your church, and a minaret the bell tower, on the coast the orthodox priest and the imam will be drinking coffee. You mean... - All in all, what you are doing is not enough. We must hit harder, not just the men, but the women too. Some women use the Pill as well as condoms. Double protection. Get it? I propose a little repackaging. Instead of the Pill, l will be selling them vitamins. We'll strike at both ends, men and women. And a pregnancy test. 30 kunas. See? Thanks to us, even Muslims are converting to Christianity. Here's the next one. If it carries on like this with the weddings and pregnancies, we could have as many births as deaths for the first time in 30 years. The Pope will be pleased when l tell him this. The Pope? I've gotten an invitation to visit the Holy Father with the parish youth. Come in! Praise the Lord. - For ever and ever. Sorry to bother you... - What happened? My daughter. We sent her to the city to hairdressing school but she's back, oh dear! Come here, let people see yo... Congratulations. - That's not for congratulating Father Jakov. A baby and no husband. Her dad will kill us when he gets back from the boat. You should have been careful. Those city boys promise everything, but then... It wasn't the city boys but our own, last summer when missy came back home for holidays. Then everything's OK, the girl surely knows who the father is. Go on, tell them. - What's this? - The list. - What list? - Who it could be. Jor-gen. - Hungarian, not one of ours. Norwegian on holiday. - Ah, J?rgen. - That's what he said. Last name? Address? He didn't say. Fine. We'll take care of this before your father gets back. God bless you. Come on, let's go. And l have a game tomorrow for getting into the third veterans league. Don't worry, I'll take care of everything. I gathered you here to tell you that tomorrow morning you all have to go to the city to give a blood sample. You can do it here, but it's better for all of us to do it in the city, because: It concerns our little Vesna Biki?. I know that you all know her. She had a baby and you know the father could be any one of yo... Father, can't be me, l used condoms. Petar, the kiosk guy, will testify that l bought them. I bought them from him too. - I knew you would say that. That doesn't guarantee anything. The instructions clearly state: "Condoms are never 100% effective." "Too much force can result in breakage." "3% of condoms may have a factory error." "Made in Taiwan." How could all 3 of us have a factory error? - 3 per cent. Not all of you. It could just be one, but we still have to establish who. He's right. I bought a lawnmower from Taiwan, it broke after 3 days. Enough! Better resolve this as men and as Christians. Otherwise I'll have to denounce you from the altar in front of everyone. Bring the results to me. So, not one of them is the father. Then it's the Norwegian. - No. That means we can choose the groom. - No, not that. How will you find the Norwegian? They'll all call the child a bastard. Jure is the best choice. He's a Croat, a Catholic. But the others are also Croats and Catholics. Not all Croats are the same, and certainly not all Catholics. Some are just Croats on paper. Jure's dad gave his life for Croatia. I don't think little Vlado's bad. - He's not, but Jure is a much better Croat and groom. If l had a daughter, l'd rather give her to Jure than Vlado. Jure, do you take Vesna to be your wife? Yes. And we end our news with an unusual report. With Croatia struggling with a dramatic fall in its population, the birth rate on one Dalmatian island in the past 6 months has increased by 70 %. Drop dead! - Congratulations, Jure! - Piss off! Fuck you and your Taiwanese. News of the baby boom has also spread abroad. Many married couples have come to this beautiful Adriatic island. - A postcard, please. - Choose. One with the church or with the whole village? No, I'll take this one. Here is Nada ?urjak reporting. The locals are happy with their tourist boom outside the season. They say the sea here improves fertility so some go swimming even in December. We came as soon as we heard. We swim several times a day. We went to Medjugorje too, so we're hoping for a baby finally. I would say that this natality tourism will certainly help our village's tourist potential, which means we can offer tourists much more than sea and sun. Not true! We in the opposition think the village is totally unprepared for the season. We need a new plan to improve our facilities, but the Mayor's done nothing. I didn't interrupt you. - I haven't spoken yet. - You're talking now. And you're interrupting me. - Please, can l say something constructive? - Go on. Obviously there are different opinions, as we would expect, but what is the church's position? Here's the parish priest Father Fabijan. The Church refutes all sensationalism but is joyful for every new life. Today's media is full of the culture of death. Married couples are too afraid to have children, but l would like to tell them all a quote from our Holy Father Pope John Paul II, whose slogan was: "Don't be afraid." Dear viewers, this is the end the news. You come as well to this Adriatic pearl, which we can now call the island of love. - I quit. - Why? There are side effects. - What side effects? - Foreigners! They started buying houses. First a German couple, then a Serb. If it continues on like this, soon Arabs will start coming. Marin, please, calm down, we'll talk tomorrow. Don't be upset, l just don't want our island full of blacks and Chinese. Stop, stop. Enough. Kristina, when you sing don't look around, just straight ahead. The Holy Father will be sitting in front of yo... Let's go! We are your little angels You embrace us with your spirit We are your little angels Needing your love - Who is it? - It's me, Marta. No, thank you, everything is clean here. I resign! Have someone else clean for you, l won't anymore. Wait! Just a moment, hold on! If you're unhappy with the pay, we can arrange something. I will work for the Church for free, but for you no more. What now? Are you going to tell me you use this for blessings? Calm down, I'll explain. You see, it's not used at all. - Sure, you like it more without one. No, l used it for something completely different. As far as l know, there's only one thing they're used for. - Goodbye. - Marta, wait... Carry on. Will you listen to the song for the Pope? - Just a minute. Marta, I'll explain! - No need, it's all perfectly clear. Father Fabijan? - Wait, Luka. - My son's been killed. I wanted to ask you about his funeral. What happened? A mine? A bear. - What bear? A brown bear. It attacked him, when he was demining in the woods. I was worried about the mines but the poor soul got killed by a bear. Our dear Stjepan, l speak on behalf of everyone from the village. Your death is proof that we in Croatia are notjust in danger from mines left by the Serbian occupiers, but also from other similar beasts: Wolves, bears and wild boars. Have you explained it to her? Don't worry about me, but what if someone tells the police? No one will. They all think it's because of their skills as lovers. People don't have money to raise children, that's why they use them. My late mother had no money, but still had six of us. Three died. - The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away. He can't give now when everyone is wearing rubber on their dicks. Marin, please, the deceased is here. - They use them because of AIDS. Anti-Croatian conspiracy! So, AIDS is a problem, but the Croatian nation dying out is not? That's why l sell the ones with holes only to Croats. So now l appeal to our hunting clubs to create normal working conditions for our pyrotechnicians. Awww. I sent a letter to the bishop. - What letter? I was angry at you, so l sent the bishop a letter with that condom that l found. Why didn't you say so immediately? - I forgot. When does the mail go? - On the 4pm ferry. Quick, we can still catch it. They have to understand that people are our priority. We promise you, Stjepan, we'll make sure that your death was not in vain. Rest in God's peace in the Croatian soil you loved so dearly. Father Fabijan had to run. Figs... He will be quick, Petar will help him. Kristina, Kristina call me as soon as you get there! - Stop! And listen to the priest! Here they come! Let us pray. What happened? Good news. I think your late Stjepan is going to be a father in 7 or 8 months. Petar and Marin will explain. A few days ago the trumpet girl Stjepan is dating... ...was dating, came to my kiosk. She bought a baby postcard. While l was putting a stamp on it l saw what she wrote: "Come quick. Important news. Kiss." And yesterday after they brought the coffin, she came to my pharmacy. I filmed her with my mobile buying a pregnancy test. She clearly wanted to double check if she's pregnant. Then she went home. She stayed there for 15 minutes, exactly what it takes to pee and do the test. Petar filmed that bit. Then she went to the doctor's, a sign that the test was positive. She didn't stay long. Because there's no way to get an abortion on the island. So she went to the harbor and bought a ticket for tomorrow's ferry. She clearly decided to get an abortion in the city. You see, it's not all so bad. Don't cry, don't cry. God, what a beautiful baby. It could have frozen. A clear case of attempted infanticide. Look, Petar, what a beautiful baby. - Yes, it's beautiful. Is it a boy or a girl? - I don't know, l haven't looked. A little boy. We have to call the police. You'll be witnesses. If you tell anyone about the baby, I'll tell everyone about the holes. Sorry? You heard me. You don't intend to keep him a secret, do you? No. I can say l gave birth to him. This is the last chance for us to have a baby. See how he's looking at us? - Lf you want a child, adopt one. There are plenty of orphans. I'll write you a recommendation. - We can't. - Why? The law won't let me, l'm officially insane. Insane? You? - When the war started, l tried to avoid the draft. A doctor hooked me up with a mental institution and now l can't adopt, because they think l'm mentally ill. Don't cry. Let's go home. He's wet. Wait! How can you give birth to him? You need a certificate from a gynecologist. Even l can't register him without those papers. Marin will help us. He knows doctors. A little money fixes everything. Don't worry, Father. He might as well be our child. Maybe he was born thanks to our holes. - What is it? - The trumpet girl. You haven't told her l told you she's pregnant, did you? - No. But you as a priest could persuade her not to abort. Luka, I've done what l can. You see, Father, this child is all we have left of our son. No, don't cry. Don't cry. Is that a baby crying? - No, those are cats. - Cats? They're in heat. Aren't they, Father? I know nothing. Marin! Hey, Marin. What is it? - Open up, it's important. Where are you traveling? - Nowhere. I've come for some baby food and diapers, I've become a dad! When? - Just now. Since your boyfriend was killed, it's not easy to decide to have a baby. But maybe this was meant to happen. - What? The baby you're carrying. Maybe it's part of God's plan, someone for Stjepan to leave behind. Stjepan didn't want it. We used protection. I really don't know how it happened. If it's God's will that two people conceive a child, then no protection can stop it. We Christians believe in the afterlife. If you asked Stjepan now, he'd definitely want you to keep the baby. How will l manage on my own? - You won't be on your own. There's no better occupation for a woman than to be a mother. That's easy for you to say, Father. Where will l go? I earn a little at funerals, but that's it. The Church will help yo... She just needs to give birth. We'll bring him up, feed him, educate him. We just need those 20 critical days for an abortion to pass. That's all. The reading is taken from the Acts of the Apostles. In those days, many people believed and turned to the Lord. News reached the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. When he arrived and saw... and saw... Congratulations. ...what the grace of God had done... Bravo, bravo! ...he was glad... - Congratulations. - Thank yo... - Is it a boy or? - A boy. On the ultrasound we saw his little dick. ...and encouraged them to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts. You're completely crazy! - Don't worry, Marin took care of everything. We're telling everyone Marta's been to the gynecologist and is expecting. That way no one will be suspicious when Florijan's born. - Florijan? That's what we're going to christen him. Marin will be godfather. Marta looks like she's in her 6th month. - On purpose. So she won't carry him so long. - Good afternoon. - Afternoon. Young Vlado's learning, he'll do it all. I'm just here if he screws up. On the 27th, the day before yesterday, we began the... Investigation. - Investigation. A girl's gone missing. I start the conversation... - Interview. - Interview. You know many people here, perhaps someone's told you something. I don't understand. Who's missing? That little trumpet girl. But when did she go missing? Her mother reported it... - The day before yesterday. Maybe she went on a trip? We have discovered she bought a ferry ticket, but so far there are no... Witnesses? - Witnesses to confirm our findings. Please, let us know if you hear anything. Yes. Of course. - Let's go. We should tell Luka. What? - That they're looking for her. - Why? - I thought you knew. - What? Luka locked her up. You advised him to. Where did he lock her up? She's here in the attic, ever since that evening when you spoke with her. You said it's vital to wait until the deadline for the abortion passes. Hold on. - Don't worry about a thing. She has everything she needs. My wife cooks for her, she has a TV to watch the soaps. We'll let her go as soon as the abortion deadline passes. Sorry, but l have to go to the police. Then get ready for some funerals. I have plenty of my son's guns. I'll protect his child for him. Jure, where are the policemen? They went to the mainland to get a dog. - What dog? - A bloodhound. They're going to search the whole island until they find the trumpet girl. Jesus, what a boat. Tycoon or mafioso? A bishop. You shat yourself, Father, shat. Jesus walked on water, walked. He could, but you can't, you can't. - Leave me alone, Ana. Get lost! I think l can explain everything. I don't know where to begin. Unofficially... it's better to use one, than to make babies, like some irresponsible priests. But, l don't use them. What? You do it without one? That's not what l meant, l don't use them at all. Who with? What do you mean who with? - Who do you not use them with? I'm just concerned it's not with any children. No, God, no. Why are you so surprised? You see what our brothers are doing... ...in Ireland, America, Belgium, Holland, - Australia... - Yes, l know. But that is not the case here. - So, there are no minors involved? - No. - That's OK then. Your Excellency, l do have something to confess. I did it for the Church, because the island is dying out. I put holes in the condoms to help the natality. Anyone who uses it, actually isn't. I have to compliment myself, l have equaled the number of births to the number of deaths. It was even on TV. I've heard all sorts of things from priests, but this excuse... Genius. Genius. Pure genius. You're good. I'm just glad there are no children involved, then l'd have to transfer yo... I'm glad it's nothing serious, you're about to be on your own in the parish. Where is Father Jakov going? Don't tell him, but it looks like Father Jakov is getting promoted. I am glad. Those holes are a good idea of yours. Perhaps we should do it all across the nation. I'll discuss it with the Archbishop. Genius! Sound insulation. My invention. 3 layers. Glass wool, polystyrene and egg boxes. The baby can cry normally, but no one will hear anything. Two things. First, no more holes, it's all gone wrong. Second, we have to discuss how to save the trumpet girl. Marin's coming. - Why us? - 'Cause... Because it's all our fault. We're safe. Marin and l deleted everything from our mobiles. I don't want Luka to kill me now that we finally have a baby. Everyone knows his house is full of guns. He's just saying that, there won't be any weapons. Here, choose one. - What's this now? For self-defense, if he shoots. - No. No, Marin, no! You know he's armed. - Marin, please. No guns! Time to go. He's stopped crying. Where're you going now? - To the lighthouse and back. By boat, so the boy gets some fresh air. I dried some ham in this attic once. I think there's a window in the roof. Someone's coming. You stay here, I'll go up. You'll need this. Ma'am? We've come to free yo... I knew you'd try something. Now I'll have to lock you up too. Put the gun down. I said a gun would be useful. You put the gun down. Leave that alone, woman. It could go off accidently, guns are not for yo... Get in. Marin! She has to go to the hospital immediately. Hide the baby! Good evening! Yesterday the Holy Father received some young people from Croatia. They wore national dress and sang songs to the delight of Benedict XVI. The Pope then enjoyed a friendly chat with the young believers. It's not good, Father. - Will she live? Yes, but l'm afraid she won't be able to have any more children. Could we take her for treatment somewhere else? We'll collect money. - I'm sorry, you waited too long. How was Kristina's singing? - Excellent! The Pope loved it. That German, he drowned. A heart attack from the cold sea. I brought you a signed book from the Pope. I would like to confess. Even though you have sinned, Father Fabijan, your intentions were not bad or against God. You acted in the spirit of the Gospels, but you were naive. You forgot the beginning of the Bible and that we are imperfect beings. Some mistakes cannot be corrected, some can. The child is most important. If a woman leaves a child, it doesn't mean she's abandoned him. Marta's pregnancy is a lie, and lies breed evil. You have to find the child's mother. Jose. A Serbian name. Jos?. Spanish. If you ask me, l would be very suspicious of little Vicka, Mara the widow and Mikula the cripple's Verica. Praise the Lord. - For ever and ever. And where's Kristina? Isn't she singing at Mass today? She can't. She says she's got a sore throat. She caught a cold in Rome. Here, l brought some binoculars. - Binoculars? Are you crazy? Position yourself where you can see if anyone's acting odd. Especially those three. - What do you mean, odd? Just watch and keep low. For the Lord honored the father above the children, and he confirmed the right of the mother over her sons. Whoever honors his father, he atones his sins... This is the word of the Lord. Ana! Ana! Put it down! Poor Ana. She took an oath she'd go on her knees for a year for her child to be sane. So who fucked her? I had the whole village under control. I never thought of her. Everything's fine. You'll take better care of him. No way! That family? You heard what her brother did to their old father. And how he ended. As far as l know, those illnesses are hereditary. Maybe Florijan will never get ill, surrounded with love in your family. Maybe. And maybe not. He could turn out worse than his mother. I'll talk to Marta. I will. She won't believe yo... She'll think you're making it up to separate her from her child. You don't think the child's strange? Strange, how? I don't know... does he bite or something? How can he bite, he's got no teeth yet. Why do you ask? Maybe there's an illness in his family. Well even if he is ill, he's ours. I hate people who give up their children because they're ill. Come on, sit down, it'll get cold. You have a prescription? - What for? - Only with prescription. You can't sell vitamins instead of the Pill either. Here you are. But be careful, these are my strongest sleeping pills. One before bedtime. What about a powder? I have a hard time swallowing pills. Pound them into powder. Hey, reverend! Are you asleep? Sleep, you bloody... You fucked up my life! We're giving him back. Here's the pacifier, food and a few diapers. What about Marta? - I'll take care of her. Florijan is used to you now, it'll be a sin. Yes. But, l found out where crazy Ana was nine months before we found him. Being treated in a nuthouse. That means it wasn't our condoms. And it also means his father is crazy like his mother, or worse. What am l supposed to do with him? - Place him in an orphanage. He would have ended up in one if we hadn't taken him in. What is it now? I am begging you For just another day And then let me die Get in here before Father Jakov sees us! I am begging For just another day And then let me die Let me drift away into a dream Father! Petar! - Take him. - I have to get Jure down. I have to go as well. - Wait until we get him down. Marta. She's calling you now. It will be suspicious if we both don't answer. Tell her you don't know anything. Give him the pacifier! Hello, yes? No, l haven't seen him. Fuck it, the pacifier fell. One life is not enough One life with you The heart is not ashamed l kneel... Stand before you Hello! Jure! I'm begging you... - Get down! You're causing a disturbance! Father! Hey! Father! Where're you going? Father! Come here, Father! Hey, everyone! Don't buy condoms from Petar, they're fucked up! So am I. Where is he? - He just left. He's not here. Petar took him. You'll wake Father Jakov. - I don't care if he's the Pope! Fly, fly away, fly, fly away My little birdie Shiny star of my sky Fly, fly away, fly, fly away Jure! Come on, get down, please. Your child needs you! Fuck off, priest! Fly, fly away, fly, fly away Petar! They'll take him away from me. I live for today, not for tomorrow We all wander in our own ways Everything's a mad dash in this world l live for today, not for tomorrow Give us another one! Better that he sings. He won'tjump while he's singing. Do you know Let me Die Tonight? Son! O, my boy! - My God! - Mom! O, my boy! - Mum! Mum, go back home! - Get down right away! - Mom! Do you hear me? - Mom, go home! Get down, or I'll jump into the sea! If you die, we both die! Get her! She can't swim! People! - Mom! - Over there! Over there, people! I would like to confess. I did that. I realized that the only reason he wanted to confess, is to force me into silence. I was the greatest threat to him. He knew if he confessed to me about little Kristina, just as l confessed to him, l'd never break the seal of confession. But you just told me everything. Yes, in confession. It will remain a secret. What will you do with it? Thanks to our holy sacrament, it will all remain a secret between us. And the police? Did they discover anything? They did. The autopsy showed the girl was pregnant. But they don't know the father is your newly appointed auxiliary bishop. Say the Act of Contrition. No need. No point in absolving each other. Luckily, I've got my tumor, but you... How you will cope, l don't know. - Goodbye. - No. Farewell. Praise the Lord. I have to confess. THE PRIEST'S CHILDREN A FILM BY VINKO BRE?AN BASED ON THE DRAMA THE PRIEST'S CHILDREN BY MATE MATl?l?
