ROME, 11 O'CLOCK This film is liberally inspired by the stories of those people involved... in an actual event that took place on Via Savoia, Rome, in January of 1951. It was an event that would go on to touch an entire city; an entire country. DISASTER ON VIA SAVOIA 50 INJURED, SOME CRITICALLY 150 GIRLS LOOKING FOR JOB ARE SWEPT AWAY AS STAIRCASE COLLAPSES ONE OF THE 60 GIRLS IN HOSPITAL DIES ONE OF THE TYPISTS INJURED IN THE DISASTER ON VIA SAVOIA DIES THREE INVESTIGATIONS FOR THE DISASTER ON VIA SAVOIA Thank you to the authorities; The Rome Fire Department... the girls from Via Savoia who agreed to be interviewed... and the journalists, who with their words on the victims of this disaster... provided a profound contribution to the reconstruction of the facts... and thus, the understanding of this tragic event. Some of the real victims of the disaster also play roles in the film - This tragic event started with a simple classified advertisement... one of the many that are published in the newspapers each and every day. SEEKING: TYPISTS WITH EXPERIENCE. 37, LARGO CIRCENSE, 11 O'CLOCK. Chestnuts! Chestnuts, warm chestnuts! Can I have 10? How much is that? 20 lire. Ah, then give me 5. And one on the house. Chestnuts! Chestnuts, warm chestnuts! Get your warm chestnuts! Hey, Blondie! Hot off the press, Miss. Do you want one? Here, 50 copies... Oh, God! Hey, Darling! Over here! Chestnuts, warm chestnuts! Get your warm chestnuts! I just can't stand short men. Two coffees. And hurry it up, please. There's an army over there already. Here you go, Miss. Oh. Hi, Adriana. Hi. Have you changed your hairstyle? It looked better before. We used to work together. They sacked me... but she stayed. I don't work there anymore, either. You don't work there anymore? Bye. - Strange she's not there anymore... - How come? I don't like speaking about people behind their back, but... Miss, your coffee is getting cold! I hope this doesn't take long. I left the soup on the stove... Is this the address in the paper? Hey, you! There's a queue, you know. Who put her in charge? - Wow, it's cheerful over here! - I know. Hey, stop! Stop! Damn bus! Look! Did you see that? Keep walking! She's showing off her legs! Morning! Excuse me, could I borrow a needle and thread for a moment? My tights got snagged. They're ruined, my dear. You won't fix that! You would be better off buying a new pair. Sorry to bother you. Ah, there it is, over there. When you introduce yourself say your father's public servant. It always helps. Mother is dead... Oh, and that you know some French... - Yes, Father. - And... If things aren't so serious... You know... I don't need to explain everything. You're a big girl now. - Yes, Father. - Bye, Dear. - Bye. - Bye. - Say goodbye. - Bye, Clara. - Bye. And be careful, okay? Let's go. - Can I help you? - A copy of 'Songbook', please. - Pretty and a singer, eh? Here you go, 50 lire. - Thank you. Angelina! Come down here, I have to talk to you. What are they doing over there? They've been waiting for an hour. Come down here and I'll tell you. Yeah, you'll tell me with your hands. I know what you're like. Tell me what they're doing. Come down and we'll find out together. Leave me alone! Go and pick up the groceries, go on! I'm going, I'm going. Go on, get to the front. Who got here after you? They all got here after me. Then let's start. You got here after her. It's her who should wake up. Wake up, dear! Drop it, Mother. Drop what? She didn't even sleep last night, this stupid girl! You got here first, so you should be first. Go on! Hey, take it easy! Mrs. Porter, could we come in? Let us in, we'll be good! Don't make such a racket, you'll wake up the tenants! At least open the gate. Not until the director gets here! And when will this director be here? I'm hungry already! It's raining, girls! I just felt a drop. Stop! Hey, stop! This must be it. Well, I'm getting out. Can you change this? It'll be 500 lire. I'm not getting out, I just need some change. 2,000... 4,000... 10,000... Will that do? Bye, Last Love. - You're my last, you know. - You think I'd believe that? - Bye, Paolino. - Giovanni! Right, Giovanni. Have a nice trip. Hey, look at this fairy princess! Hey, look at this idiot! Give me a kiss. You had better go. Want me to wait for you? No, go back to work. Oh, I forgot to make the bed. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. If you get the job, I'll have to wash the plates, too. Perhaps I'll be better at that than trying to be a painter. Bye. Would you like to use my umbrella? - Thank you. - I'm going over there, too. Bye. That bag, how much was it? Just out of curiosity... It was a gift. From him? - No. - Ah, I didn't think so. He seemed like the type who wouldn't drop a lira if you shook him upside down. God, I love that bag so much! Here, stand with me. Well? Never seen two ladies before? How long before they let us in? My hat's getting all wet! Never, if you wake up the entire building! When does this building wake up? My daughter was up at 5! I've come all the way from Viterbo! All I care about is the tenants! Then let's give these tenants a wake-up-call! Tenants! Tenants! Tenants! Cut that out, or I'll call the police! What if there's a thunderstorm? What thunderstorm? It isn't even raining anymore! It's stopped raining, girls! Giorgetta, let's go. But Father, what about the job? This is a cattle market. Worse than a cattle market! Let's go! Who does that guy think he is? So, we're a disgrace because we're looking for a job? They say he's a retired general. Even the generals' daughters are looking for work, now. Who's this? She looks like a Christmas tree. Still in the habit of stealing my shoes, I see? It must be her sister. You could have let me borrow them, just this once. Well, I have to go to the office too, don't I? Bye. - Gimme! Gimme! - Come on, get walking! Look at that queue. Good luck. Well, don't pull that face. Today is a good day, I can feel it. You say that every day. I'm going to try my luck at the subway construction site. Back of the queue, like the others. - Look, here's the director. - Yeah, it's the one with umbrella. - Excuse me, Director... - Director, listen... Excuse me... Just a moment. Please, just a moment! You too, Miss. Move aside. Excuse me, Sir. How many jobs are available? - One. - One? Girls, there's just one job! - Just one? - I can't believe it! - Who's that? - What's he doing? - He's opening the gate. - Yeah, but he wants to come out. One at a time, girls. Let me pass, I say! Miss! Miss! Miss! Miss... Will you be my war sponsor? War sponsor? Why, is there a war? Well, no... it's just... You know, to keep in touch. - Miss, will you give me your address? - No. Run, or you'll lose your chance! I don't feel like running. Well, will you give me your address? You address, Miss? It's Cornelia Riva, Tiburtino. Hey... What's he smiling about? Business must be going well. Perhaps he was smiling because he's a nice man. How was he supposed to smile? Like in the toothpaste adverts? Well, he should smile properly! Damn, why are you getting so worked up? Can't a director smile, too? For me he can smile or cry, just as long as he brings home money. Come on, up you go. This girl was here before you. I dare any of you to prove her wrong. Then why is she always last? What can I do if she's like that? Go on. I'm sorry, but you can't go in front. Save my place for me, please. - Don't start going out and in again. - Go too far and we won't let you pass. She must have time to waste, being romantic at a time like this. The number, Miss! You forgot the house number. 62! 6... 2! Write to me, too. This is my address! Don't forget to write, okay? Hey, the sun's coming out! The sun, how beautiful! Make yourself at home, will you? Either go flirt with boys or stand in the queue, yeah? Think they'll hold the job for you while you're playing gooseberry? - Miss goody-two-shoes... - Oh, let her through. They're already writing love-letters! Come here, sit down. Well, did you exchange details? Do you believe in love at first sight? I met my husband when we were in nursery school. "Antonio Bertini, Destroyer D14." Mogadishu? - Where's Mogadishu? - Far away, in Africa. Where the women cover their faces? If I were you, I wouldn't be here. You were born to sing. Why don't you go and sing on the radio? - On the radio? - Yes. I'd like to, but how would I do that? And anyway, my tonsils bother me. I might be having an operation. Then have an operation. Quiet, someone's coming out! When will this thing start? I'm not saying anything. All I know is that I have to get the director his coffee. What company is it? Can't you tell us? Is it a public or private firm? How much do they pay a month? Don't ask me questions that I can't answer! I'm mute! They won't even tell us how much the pay is! If they don't pay more than 15,000, I won't even consider it. Then let's all agree on it. - 15,000 lire, minimum. - Yes, good idea. I'd be happy with 10,000. I'd really like it if they gave you the job. Look, this is how you dance. Is that the samba? I thought it was the spaghetti dance. - Didn't you know that Toto is a prince? - A prince? Really, with that face? Darling! - Here, hold onto my bag for me. - Where are you going? I'm going to become a typist. A typist, you? Why? What do they have that I don't? No, nothing, but... Where did you learn that? Let go, she might see me! Well, then... - Come in here with me. - No. - Come on. Keep it here, I'll pick it up later. You take advantage of me because I'm a servant girl. - How old are you? - 20. - I thought you were older. - Make way, make way! Come off it, Girl! I've got eyes in the back of my head, you know. You know very well that domestics aren't allowed in the elevator. I'm a servant girl over there, but not in this building. Here or there, it's the same thing. There are rules, can't you read? Alright. I won't take the elevator. Ah, good. But I'll stay here as long as I like. Hey, where are you going? I was in front. Yeah, let her go through. God knows what we're waiting for, anyway. Look, even the general's daughter is coming back. - Are you really the daughter of a general? - Yes. See? Such a lovely perfume! Such nice material. I'm just being curious... but do you really need a job? If I didn't, I wouldn't be here. I've guessed who you are. You're a fallen aristocrat. No, I'm not a fallen aristocrat. But don't worry about it. If she doesn't need a job, why is she even here? Quiet, you and let the adults talk! People have their own reasons. "Private firm seeks secretary; beautiful appearance." What do they mean by "beautiful"? It means that if you're ugly, you might as well die of hunger. Does that seem right to you? I don't mean for me... Not to brag, but appearance is one thing I do have... But look at her, for example. Should she die of hunger? I've had so many interviews, they promise to call but never do. Who knows what they're looking for? All I want is to be a typist. It's obvious what they're looking for. Once, this Sicilian guy told me: "I'll hire you to work in this office..." "but you have to give me a kiss, first." Since then I go everywhere with my father. That's why you're still unemployed. What about me? Two months ago I pack my suitcase and come to Rome I get to this office and they say: "We're concerned with artistic things." "Think you could pose nude?" I almost fainted. You had better hide your ring. If they see that you're married, they'll never hire you. Let me just dry this hat out. Quiet down, girls! Come in one at a time... and try to be quick about it. Who's first? Go on, then! Don't make me go in there. I don't think I'm the first. In you come, Miss. Can I leave my suitcase here? Go ahead. Are you not from Rome? No, Miss. I'm from Viterbo, I came all the way for this. Please, take a seat. Sit down, sit down. Insert a sheet of paper. Slowly. Write: "Esteemed Mr. Marussi & Co." "Milan." "Marussi." "Milan." I knew she couldn't write. Looks like the building is awake, after all! My God, I almost want to go in there and help her. What is it? Hold it in! She's still faster than me. Yes, I'll be right back. I'm just going to the shop... Quiet! Hey, this is my building, not yours! I've tried to go out 10 times this morning, already! Crazy woman... I'm afraid that you type a little too slowly, Miss. I know that I type slowly. But see, Sir, I'm very willing. Alright. We'll see, won't we? We'll see. Director, Sir... I can't go back to my village. I've been taking the train to Rome every morning for 2 months. They call me "Rome and Back". Well, off you go now. Then we'll see, won't we? We'll consider you, I promise. No, I'm not moving from here. Tell me something, first. What do you expect us to tell you, my dear? At least tell me if there's hope. Is there any hope, Sir? Alright, yes. Go ahead, hope! I really do hope, you know! - I really do hope! - Go on, I have lots more girls to see. Go on. An send in another, please. That's it, you did the right thing to take it off. Put it in your pocket. How long has she been in there? Who knows what the director told her. How did it go? He said that I can really hope. What a nut... Let's hope you're not as bad as the last girl. Have a seat. Write: "Esteemed Mr. Marussi & Co." "We inform you that the last shipment of cognac and champagne..." Very good! You've worked as a typist before. - Yes. - Where? - Where? - In the office of Attorney Fiore. Ah, Attorney Fiore. Were you fired? I quit. You quit such a good job? - Yes. - But, why? See her out, please. They're all crazy! - Adriana, are you crying? - What happened? What's wrong? - Did it go badly? - Poor thing. Did they hit you? She says they hit her. Girls! They hit women here, too? Stop crying, what's wrong? - What if they hit you, too? - No, no... Come here! Who hit you? What's going on? Sorry, Sir, but they're saying that she was hit... Hit? What do you mean, she was hit? No one's been hit. Quiet a moment, please! And listen up. I can't possibly test all of you. Organise yourselves. I can test 30, 40 at the maximum. The others, it would be better if they just leave. Thank God, I'm fifth in line. There's no need for us to worry. Miss, you're still here? Just for a bit longer, to see if there's any hope. What's she up to? Look, a paper typewriter! There must be 200 of them. See another one in, Miss. I'm ready, Sir. Dictated or copied? Copied, you copy it. But, you're a machine gun! Yes, Sir... An old machine gun. No one will beat her. - Excuse me. - She's too good, I'm leaving. You're right. No, I'm staying here until the end. Luciana! How did it go? They told me to come back... in a week's time. If they said in a week's time... Always the same old story. Come on, let's go home. Do you see all these people? No, no. If I can just get in the door... I'm sure that it'll go well. Where are you going? I'm going to try my luck at the furnace construction site. Just to give me something to do. Thanks again, Sir. Goodbye. Blessed girls, are you still all here? Just a moment, just a moment! Excuse me, Sir... a word. What is it? - Just a minute of your time, Sir. - What do you want? It's something very important. Go ahead. Please test me, Sir. Well, why aren't you waiting your turn like the rest? There are too many in front of me. You said that you can only test 40 of us at the maximum. I'm sorry, but you have no more right than the others. My husband hasn't worked for 6 months... but if I can find a job... I'm very good, you know. Test me. - What happened to her? - I don't know. What's she doing in there? How shameless! Do you hear her? Why did you let her pass? She forced her way through. Quiet, she tricked all of us! When she comes out, she'll have me to deal with. I thought something might have happened to her. - You should be ashamed. - Well, are you happy with yourself? What right do you have, eh? How come you went in before us? Who gave you the right? If they give you the job, we'll wreck this place. I... I really need it. "I really need it!" What about me, then? I've been looking for a job since the day I was born! And me? Everyone has their own problems, you know! If I told you mine, no one would believe me! But her husband is unemployed! My father is unemployed. If it's about who needs it most, I should be first in line. I want to see the director, too. Let me through. Oh, no you don't. I want to be tested, too! Luciana! Luciana! Luciana! Girls, don't push! Gianna, where are you? Gianna! Stop! Stop! Help! - Lucia, give me your hand. - Yes, but don't move. Fixed station, please respond! Send all available wagons and ambulances, right away! My child, my child... Come on, pass me the ladder. Come on, that's it. Go on. Come on. Get her up, will you? Gianna, where's my Gianna? Come on, quick! - Calm yourself, Ma'am! - My Gianna... Come on. Calm yourself, please. Come on, give me your hand. Quick, don't be afraid. Here, grab hold of me. Let go. That's it, pull! Angelina! Angelina! Angelina! Just a moment. Thank you. Quick, get out, please. But I have to get to the station. I'll miss my train... My bag... I lost my bag... and my umbrella, too. Come, come with me. No! Your name, Miss? I'm a journalist. No, leave me alone. Where are you going? I'm fine, I don't want to go to the hospital. Don't you see that you're hurt? Help! Ouch, my hand... - Make way! Make way, will you? - Let him pass! - Give me a hand. - Go on, get up. Easy does it. Give her here. Easy, easy... Where are you taking me? - Where are we taking her? - The hospital, where do you think? Right, the hospital. Chronicle? Yes, around 50 injured. Not deaths, at least not yet. At the hospital I'll send news for the other edition. Hold on, there's an injured girl... Don't be afraid, Miss. I'm a doctor. - No, I'm okay, I don't... - Just let me have a look. You might have a fracture... - He's a doctor, Miss! - No, not my shirt... Hey! That could be a title! "Girl needs job to buy a shirt." What do you think? Let go of me. I want my child. My child... Gianna! Mother... Gianna! - Gianna! - Mother! Come on, I'll take you home. No. No, I won't go there. I won't give them the satisfaction of seeing me like this. Then come with me. Come on, Angelina. Here. See, you can sit down. You can rest for a bit, then sort yourself out. Don't be afraid. It's not like this morning. Easy does it. She needs a doctor, now. - Cornelia! Cornelia! - Get away from here, go on! Crying now, are you? You know whose fault it is? It was you! Here, take the lipstick. - Thank you, Miss. - You're welcome. I knew the staircase would collapse! - Sit down, Miss. - Thank you. Give me that mirror. - This morning a black cat crossed my path. - Really? And that's nothing! Then, I saw a man... dressed all in black. And he was looking at me... Looking at me... As if to say... "Don't go..." "Don't go!" - Here, Miss, use my mirror. - Thank you. Shouldn't you go before you miss your train? Oh, don't worry about me. There are so many trains. Is this your bag? Do I look like the type who would carry a bag like that? Keep looking, keep looking... I'm not moving until they find it! Oh, God! Now it's starting to rain again. - Give me that. - If it's raining we should go. Make way, let the police through! Someone must be responsible for what has happened here, no? Calm down. An inquest has been opened, and we'll see, we'll see... "We'll see." While those poor girls are in the hospital! Be reasonable. How is it the director's fault? So it's the girls' fault, is it? Alright, but you certainly can't blame it on the architect. Well, there must be someone to blame. The porter should have sent them away from the stairs. It's not like they're children, why didn't they just leave? When someone is looking for work, they don't always think that way. Not all of them are really in need of work, you know. I bet some of them just went to chat with friends. Yeah, while queuing up in the rain? Hey, look! - Are you Mr. Ferrari, the director? - Yes. Accompany us to the station, please. - Mr. Umberti, architect? - Yes, that's me. Did you design the building at Number 37, Largo Circense? I heard, they just called me. Where are we going? To the police station. I knew they would try to blame me for this. Why must I come with you? The Commissioner will explain everything. Yeah, I know how these things end. It's always the landlord's fault! - Marcello Massari! - Present! Luigi Piaggia! Mauro Barone! Nando! That's all for today. All those whose names I called, come with me. - The rest of you can go. - Luciana... Will there be anything tomorrow? What's wrong? Something terrible has happened. What do you mean? The staircase we were all standing on collapsed. It was me! What are you saying? I bullied my way through. Got in before the rest. The others started fighting. Then, the staircase collapsed. But, how can that be? It's all my fault. Cut that out! What's gotten into you? It was me, Nando. Idiot! Stop it! Doctor, look. This is the one you've already seen to. Where should we take her? To the operating room, quickly. What shall we do, Doctor? Stay with you? Yes, there will be no rounds today. We need all hands on deck. - I'll call the other students. - Hurry. Here, over here... - This way. - Giulia! Giulia! My child! - Anna! - Concetta! Concetta! I found her! I found her! Adriana! Adriana! Please, let me finish treating her. Giorgetta! Excuse me... Mother... Mother... Where are you, Mother? - Excuse me... - Gianna! - Gianna! - Mother? Mother! Mother! We're alive, my child. Try to keep still, Ma'am. One minute and we'll be finished. I won't be able to leave for a month. A month in here? It doesn't matter, let's just forget about everything. The debts, problems... All that matters is we're alive. Cornelia! Cornelia! Are you comfortable like that? The ring. I lost the ring... Just worry about getting better. Then we'll find it. Oh God, my head. Oh God, my head. I can't stand seeing you suffer. Are you sure he didn't break his head? Of course it hurts, with all those pillows. - Are they hard? - Yes. What can I do? Hold on, Darling. I don't understand, you had such a good job and you're looking for another. Did they fire you? I quit. You quit? Why didn't you tell me? - Are you the father? - Yes. I've taken a careful look at her. She seems to be suffering from shock... but it will pass, soon enough. Anyway, we advise you to take her home immediately. It's a miracle she didn't suffer a miscarriage. A miscarriage? Adriana, what did he just say? He told you the truth. - You're pregnant? - Yes. It's nothing serious, don't worry. - She'll be better in 10 days. - Thank goodness. Really? Excuse me, Doctor? Excuse me. Since she was a child, my daughter has always suffered with her tonsils. Then get them removed. We've always put it off, you know. Well? Well, since we're here... couldn't we take advantage and get this operation done? We'll discuss it later. Here are the newspapers. Thanks. - Here. - Thanks. I got you some sweets, too. Since you might be here a while. Who's this young man? He's the one who saved me. His name is Augusto. You saved her? I don't know how to thank you. It must have been difficult. No, it was nothing at all! It was my pleasure. No. Well, I'm here looking after her now so you can go, if you like. Well, then goodbye. Goodbye, goodbye. Goodbye. Actually, I'd love to stay. It's my day off. Oh, good! Calm down, Darling. Simona, you're here with me. Take me away, take me away! We'll be home soon, okay? I'm afraid, Carlo. I'm afraid! You've always been so brave. I want to forget everything that I saw... but I just can't. I shouldn't have let you go. I feel so weak. Help me. Mother! Simona! Oh, Simona, Simona... Elena! Hi, Simona, how are you? - Father... - Hi, Simona. This is Carlo. I still can't believe you're here. How is it possible? We had to find out about it by reading the newspaper. There's a special title, dedicated to my daughter. You can't imagine how scared we were. All our friends, you know, they called to see if you were okay. Puppi, Paola, Maurizio, everyone! How do you feel? Better. You'll sleep better with that. Does your head still hurt? - Yeah. - It'll pass. She can't even close her eyes unless she has two pillows. Lucky her! Marcello, I'll never find the ring. Why did you take it off? Everyone said they wouldn't hire me if they know I was married. I should go and sort them out! What? My boy... It was his. You shouldn't take your ring off. Darling. Here you go, Sir. Here you go, Ma'am. "Attorney Tullio Cavassi." Is that you? No, Ma'am. I'm his representative. Well, what does this lawyer want? You have been injured. You better believe it. You have the right to claim compensation for these damages... and the illustrious lawyer that I represent is at your service. And who will pay him? An inquest has been opened, Ma'am. The person made responsible for the accident will pay. And what if they don't find one? - But... - Look... we're not interested, thanks. Think about it, Ma'am. Goodbye. Lawyer fees is all we need. And you, how will you get by without your mother for a whole month? The rent, the oven... You're just like your father. He was an angel... but he didn't know how to do anything. You're too good, my child... to do all that alone. Gianna, where are you going? Needle-and-thread. Dry this up. Sister... The operation hasn't finished yet. Seaman Antonio Bertini. Destroyer D14-Mogadishu. A terrible thing, Miss, but what can you do. Of course, they see so many things at the hospital. Yes, but something like this... Heaven forbid. How did it happen? Old houses... The old houses are better than these new ones, all made with cardboard. - That's not the case. - He's right. They say that the girls were fighting among themselves. What do I know? I wasn't there. Then why did the staircase collapse? The police are stopping lots of people. They always have to find someone who must pay for everything. Yeah, but that girl in the hospital. If she dies, who pays for that? Exactly. What's her name? Just a young girl. Cornelia Riva, I think. Terrible thing for those who are to blame. Yeah, if they find them. Don't worry. What did they say about the injured? Nothing serious. Did you ask about the one called Cornelia? They don't know anything. - Ready. - Right! Here we are in the ward of a hospital... in which 70 girls are recovering, victims of the disaster at Largo Circense. Fortunately, at this moment there are no reported deaths. And now we pass you over to our colleague, Mr. Ferretti. Over to you, Mr. Ferretti. We will now listen to the bright voices of a few of the girls... with their account of what happened. Ah, let's start with you. How are you, Miss? How long have you been looking for work? I've had my typist's diploma since '46... but this is the first time I'm using t. - To go up on those stairs. - Thank you, Miss. And now, dear listeners... we arrive at another bed. Excuse me, Miss. What's your name? Alba Maiori. Miss Alba Maiori, tell us something. Like what? As soon as I get better, I'm going to find another job. I lost a hat during the collapse! If anyone at Largo Circense finds it, please bring it here to the hospital. My name is Marcella Tacchetti. Show them your coat covered in blood! Quiet, you! I took you away from that place. You're the one who wanted to go back. Well, it's useless thinking about it now. Here we are in front of bed number 12. Over to you, Miss. Tell us something about your life. What's your name? Franconi. Giorgetta Franconi. Please, go ahead. There are four of us siblings. My father is retired. The only one who works is my big brother. If my brother gets married... we're ruined. Please, go on, Miss Franconi. I would be better if I got married... but I'm not even engaged. There was one time... that someone wanted me... but then we had an argument... I don't even remember why... Giorgetta... Go on, don't be afraid, Miss. Why should she say these things? What do you care about us? We care very much, in fact. Your daughter's voice will be heard all over the world. Well, I couldn't find work. So I passed the time helping my mother. In the summer, on Sundays we would all go to the centre. We would walk up Via del Corso and Via del Tritone. Though now that it's winter, we're always at home. We never go out. I'd love to travel... Thank you, Miss. I get the impression that things must be going badly... to find yourself on those stairs. Enough! Simona doesn't need reminding. Miss? What are you doing? Just a few words, a brief statement. All the girls have done it. Leave it. It's not a good time. Leave it. As you wish. How about you, Miss? Please, tell us something. And if that place did hire you... how much would they pay you a month? 10,000? 15,000? Sounds like a miserable existence... for a girl used to living like you... who has always had everything she wanted. Women should be looked after... not sent out to work. Come on, please. - It's not the time. - Right. And look where we are now! You had them call me? Yes, Doctor. We wanted to know if my sister can leave the hospital. I could organise an ambulance. We have our car outside. Yes, but take care. She needs to be looked after. She's still very much exhausted, and needs rest more than anything. Yes, but our family doctor will take care of everything. Very well, as you wish. Can you move, Darling? Get her clothes, Elena. Mother, I'm not coming with you. Go on, Darling. You have to go. You need so many things... and I can't give you anything. I want you to get better, too. Want you to be happy. My life is very tough, as you know. And it always will be, until the end. Perhaps I'm wrong, Simona... but I can't give up my craft. It's a miserable profession... but the only one I can do. See... If I wanted to take you home... I couldn't even afford a taxi. But, why are you saying these things? I don't want to sacrifice anyone, Simona. No... Carlo? Carlo! Carlo! See? He understands, too. Now, let's hear from this pretty brunette. Do you know that millions of listeners are anxious to hear your voice? My voice? Of course, tell us something. Talk to us about your dreams, about your aspirations... Actually, my real dream would be... would be to become a singer. - Very good! Then here's your chance. What, here in the hospital? - Why not? Go on, don't be afraid. - Sing, sing! Yes, sing! Very good, Miss. Thank you. Of course, the father of the young lady is here with us. You must be proud of your daughter. Tell us something, please. Go on. The minimum wage should be higher! Actually, that has nothing to do with the collapse of the staircase. It does! You have to give me an explanation. What is there to explain? Now you know. I'll take care of the baby. If I find work. I want to know who it was! - I'll tell you, I'll tell you. - No! Now! What's going on? - He didn't know? - No. Doctor... Is the baby in any danger? No, don't worry. You're strong. Go on. Excuse me, Sister. My daughter is having her tonsils out. In the meantime, could we have a private room? I believe so. Though it does cost almost double what the common ward costs. It costs money? What, I have to pay the hospital? In the hospital, you always pay a daily rate. You must pay for the medicine, too. What did she say? What? We have to pay, now? Just a moment, just a moment. This is something that needs clearing up! What is it? They want us to pay for the hospital. Excuse me, Nurse... How much does this cost a day? 2,300 lire. But if you have health insurance through your place of work... How are we supposed to have health insurance through work... if we're all unemployed? - Do you have a penury card? - No. You need a pass to be poor, now? Then the city won't pay, either. Listen, I wish it wasn't the case, but you'll have to pay the hospital. - Did you hear that? - It's unheard of! What did they say? We have to pay the hospital? - We have to pay? - Have they gone crazy? No one would believe us if we told them! I won't pay 2,300 lire a day. What are you doing? I'm going home. I don't want anything more from you! I'm not staying in this place for a minute longer! Come on, let's go. You think my wife was waiting on those stairs for a party? I even lost my ring! What about me? A month in this place... How am I to pay for that? So that's how it is! Our daughters have to pay. Yes, they are the guilty ones. I'll write to all the newspapers! They don't know who they're messing with. Let's go. - Make way, make way. - Come on, step aside. Get back! Just a moment! Any news, Commissioner? Have you found out who is to blame? Is it true that you've arrested the architect? And the landlord, and the director? What arrests? Let's not start a scandal, now! We're simply gathering statements for the inquest. Go on! Out of the way, now! It's that one. Look what I've been reduced to. Who will pay for this? - Please, put it with the others. - Why? It's a formality. We're collecting evidence for the inquest. They're running around, shouting... but will anyone think about us unemployed when all of this is over? No one will think about me. It would be better if you went back to your village, you know? No, no. I won't go back. I can't go back. - Angelina! - Over there, under the curtain. - Angelina! - Here come my employers. Give me my bag. Angelina, what happened? Where have you been? How did you end up on that staircase? Excuse me, are you relatives? No, she's our maid. Ma she's welcome in our house as though it were her own. And she was looking for a job as a typist? Thanks for everything, Romoletto. But, why? Have we not given you everything you've ever needed? She even had keys to the cabinets. Everything, you know. We've always had faith in her. Your names, please. Heavens, no! My name in the newspapers, now? How embarrassing! Some thanks this is! Have we not always treated you like a daughter? Yeah, a daughter. I'm still a servant, aren't I? Well, what did you expect? Nothing. I'm fed up! Careful, or you'll be out in a week! That's too long for me, I won't step foot in that house again! Servants are everywhere, you know! And cheaper ones than you! Can I help you with that? Good, come on. So, what are we doing? Shouldn't we get out of here? No, I have to find my bag! I can't even walk down the street without my bag, you know. - I feel so naked! - You can find it tomorrow. Let's get out of here, I'll go and call a taxi. No. What are you after, anyway? Leave me in peace. Go and get in a taxi yourself. Alright, I'm going. Hey, me! Over here! Out of the way, out of the way! No, me! Over here? Here are the bags. Move out the way! Here it is! Here it is. What are you doing here? What have you got to do with this? It's my business. I don't have to explain myself to you. Here, give that to me. What's inside, if it's yours? You have to bother me, don't you? Well, well. What were you doing on those stairs? Why? Can't I look for work, too? I've got to be a whore all my life? You've branded me, haven't you? I can't change the person I am? Here's what I think of you people! - There. - Hey, calm down. Otherwise I'll have you spend the night inside. Yeah, you'll never get me again. It's over, it's over! Calm down, he's only doing his job. It's not his fault. Come on, get in. What's the world coming to? I can't even look for work, now. You'll never get me again, my dear! It's over! One of the girls from the collapsed staircase might die! Police search for a culprit! How did you know her? She was next to me on the stairs. She must have been about 17. If she dies, I don't know what I'll do. You're talking like a crazy woman! Get these ideas out of your head. We have enough problems. Let's go home. What can they do if they arrest me? Come on, let's go home. Read all about it! All the details on the terrifying staircase collapse! One of the girls is dying! Your boss! As soon as you found out what this man wanted... you should have left that place! I made a mistake, Father. I shouldn't have done it. But I was scared of losing my job. You could have found another one! No, it's not that easy. There were 200 of us on those stairs. And the job I did have, you know... it took me a year to find. It's better to die of hunger! Go on, get down! You're not to set foot in my house again! Adriana, welcome home! Adriana, you had us worried! Look at her! Not even a scratch! - You were lucky! - Smile, Adriana! It's over now. I can't believe she was so lucky! It's all they're talking about! - Get on. - Say, is it true that there were more than 500 girls? Poor thing, get home to your mother, she's been crying all morning. - Goodbye! - Bye! - Bye, Adriana! If he doesn't marry you, I'll kill him! He's already married. He told me that he was unhappy with his wife. That he would leave her to be with me. And instead... Afterwards, he told me... "Who can prove that it was me?" - Here they are, it's them! - It's them! Run and tell her mother, quick! Giovanni, are they drinks on you tonight? Giovanni, the worst is over! Thank you, thank you. Welcome back, Adriana! Giovanni, you can relax now. Have caught the people responsible, yet? Thank the Lord! Giovanni, take it from me: Keep her close, this beautiful daughter of yours. She might have died. Go and see your mother, go on. We'll come and see you later, I'll bring the gramophone. This is a time to dance! The whole neighborhood should celebrate tonight! Adriana, later you have to tell us everything that happened! Congratulations, Giovanni! At a quarter past 6... we shall have a commentary on the tragic collapse at Largo Circense... recorded today at the hospital... - Turn that off. Why do they always have to broadcast our shame to the world... our misery. It must be an Italian thing... Stop, Father! Stop! - What are you doing? - Stop! Stop! But, Simona... I can't, Mother... You're in no condition to do this. It's just around the corner. You'll only have to queue up again tomorrow. And every day... queuing up for some wretched job, you know? It doesn't matter! Her loss. What's wrong? Do you feel ill? What is it? I thought it was the Red Cross siren. No, my darling, don't be afraid. Well, we're almost home. If you get the chance to drop by sometime, it would be nice to see you. Goodbye. Goodbye. - Goodbye, Miss. - Goodbye, and thank you. - Goodbye. Come on, it's late. Careful crossing the street, now. He's handsome, isn't he? Yes, but he's too tall. Damn... Excuse me, just a moment! - He's coming back. - Just a moment. Please excuse me... This guy... Actually, I'm always free to drop by. I can even come by tomorrow. I don't work in the afternoon. I work continuous hours, see. Continuous hours? Continuous? - You, too? - Yes. Are you an occasional labourer? No, I work full-time. I'm at... Peroni Beer. And how much do you earn? 25,000, and a crate of bottles a month. 25,000 lire a month and a crate of bottles... Full or empty? Full, of course! What do you think? So you make around 30,000 lire a month. Much more than your average worker. - My voice? - Of course, tell us something. Talk to us about your dreams, about your aspirations... That's you! Actually, my real dream would be... - Let's go and listen. would be to become a singer. - Very good! - Then here's your chance. - Like at the hospital! Listen to this! Listen... don't be afraid. Sir, listen to this! Today they interviewed us for the radio. That's my daughter, singing. Very good, Miss. Thank you. Now it's me. is here with us. You must be proud of your daughter. Listen, I told them to raise the minimum wage! There, you heard some interviews... with the girls who were injured in the tragic collapse... - They cut it. It's getting late. That's our building. Over there? I expect you'll be going home, no? Well, I have time. I can stay out... until midnight! He's older... He can stay out as long as he likes. Very well... Since we're here, you may as well come up and have a bite to eat with us. Finally, here we are. - Good evening, Caterina. - Evening, Aunt Rosa. Caterina, good evening! Evening, everyone. The news of the staircase collapse didn't even make it here, see? They must have read it in the newspapers, no? The only newspapers around here are the old ones used to cover the windows. - Does that shock you? - Me? No, I've seen everything. Caterina, where's my umbrella? Excuse me a moment, okay? Carmela, something terrible happened, if you only knew... I lost it! You lost it? And what am I supposed to do, now? The whole winter without an umbrella? How will I manage? Tomorrow I'll buy you a new one. Tell her I'll buy a new one. - Do you have something for us? - Go on, get out of here! She's from my hometown, from Tivoli. We came here with the War. But she doesn't have my philosophy. She's always crying. But I say: "Whatever doesn't happen today, might happen tomorrow." - Ah, of course. - Isn't that right? Sure, there's no use in getting yourself down. Caterina, well? - Thanks. - You're welcome. She lent me hers because... mine was ugly. But you, couldn't you find me a job? Any job, even outside Rome. Don't worry about that now. I've been waking up every morning for 4 years and thinking: "Today is my lucky day..." "Today my life changes..." And instead... I'm back here again. Here we are. - Aunt Maria, good evening. - Good evening. Come, come on through. Make yourself at home. I won't be 2 minutes. God, what a day! Who knows where Carmela's umbrella is at this moment. And all those poor girls who ended up in the hospital. At least I didn't get hurt. I guess I am lucky, you know. Come, come on in. Hey! Here, it's 5,000 lire. That guy left if for you. I don't want to see anyone. I have to rest. I'm tired. By the way... Tomorrow, remind me... how lucky I was today. I have to play the Lotto. - Nando, don't go home. - Why, what happened? Some cops showed up in a jeep. The police are waiting for you. They're looking for Luciana. Where are you going? - I'm afraid! - Come on, get on. Let's go and see what they want. I knew they would be waiting. What will they do to me? Calm down, don't be afraid. You haven't done anything. There they are, it's them! It's them? - Was she caught stealing? - No, she was on the collapsing staircase. Then why are they arresting her? No, they just want to question her. They say that one of the girls might die. But I'm her husband! The commissioner wants to talk to your wife, not to you. I have to go alone? What about Fernando? You can't! - Get away from here, go on! - I have to come, too. - Get back! - Nando? - Get back, go on! - Go on. - Get away! Hey, shall we follow them? It means I'll be without cigarettes. That goes for me, too. Well... Here, this is enough for the train. Thanks. No, don't put it in there. You'll lose it. Check that everything's there. I packed the suitcase, you know? Do you mind that I've taken your place? You, where will you go now? I'm going back to my village. I'm better off being a countrywoman. I don't want to see my employers' faces ever again! - Hey, do they have a radio? - Yeah. Are we going? Give that here, I'll carry it. - Bye. - Bye. Well, shall we take her to the station? Come on then, let's go. Angelina! I wanted to ask you something else. Do they feed you? They feed you, they feed you. Shall we? Come on. Are they still interrogating people? They haven't told us anything... Pull this other one. In you go. Are you Luciana Renzoni? Good. Sit down with the others and wait to be questioned. And now, let's continue. Note this all down, please. Let's try to go through all the facts one by one. Without personal issues. Right, you say that the girls first came up the staircase at 10:30, yes? - Yes. - And how did that happen? It was raining, the poor girls were screaming to come in. Then he opened the front gate. I opened the gate? Of course, I had to go out, Commissioner! It wasn't me that gave an appointment to 200 girls at the same time. - What do you mean, appointment? - Alright, calm down. Excuse me, but I'm tired of this. Sorry, Commissioner, but I just want to make one thing... clear, once and for all. I needed just the one typist. One! The other year I placed an identical advertisement, and... Tell him, Miss, how many of you showed up? There were 10, 12 of us. See what I mean? Is it my fault that unemployment rates have grown so much that... more than 100 showed up? No, he means more than 200. Let's try to be precise about this number. How many of there were you? Something like 250... What? Less than that. I say around 150. Yeah, and what about those on the ground floor and outside? There were at least 300 of us. 200 or 300. It was an excessive weight, regardless. Excuse me, Architect, but what do you mean by "excessive weight"? A staircase should be able to handle... the weight of all the people who can fit on it. In theory, yes. But when I construct a staircase... I can't possible know what will happen later on. The sinking of the ground, for example... or poor maintenance of the building. As the proprietor of the building... I have no legal obligation... for inspection, nor maintenance. And besides... Considering what I get in return, I look after that building too well. Taxes, wars, rent freezes! I look after that place. And anyway, ask the tenants! Say something, for goodness sake! Say something! Then didn't call us here to make eulogies for our landlord. I'm sorry, but you know... Not even to harm me? Enough! Get back to the point. Hold on, where are you going? My wife is up there. I'm sorry, but we're not to allow anyone else up there. Do you think the collapse could have been cause by prior damage? See, this is part of the analysis that I'd like to clear up. Well, allow me to explain. In my opinion... the sheer mass of all the girls, being in a restricted space... meant that they were leaning heavily on the banisters of the staircase. Like so. At a certain point... the banister gave way... and broke through the first floor. After this, all the others broke one by one... all the way to the ground floor. Yes, but I think that the girls... weren't just leaning on the banisters... but the staircase underwent a violent argument between the girls. - At least, that's what you said. - Yes. Did you provoke this argument? Tell us how. The death of one of the typists from the collapse! Latest edition! One of the girls from the collapse at Largo Circense dies! All the details from the disaster! The death of one of the typists from the collapse of the staircase! Latest edition! One dead and many more injured in the collapse at Largo Circense! Here, Commissioner. Come on, tell us. Don't you see that she can't? Let her be. Then, someone else talk for her. Go on. Go on. You know how these things happen... And how do they happen? We were afraid that the director wouldn't be able to test us all. It would have taken a month to get through everyone. Then why didn't you just leave? Have you ever needed to look for work? Come on, let's get on with this. We had been there for an hour... when, at a certain point... At a certain point? Well, what's wrong with telling the truth? She tricked everyone to get in before us. When she came out of the office... the other girls started shouting: "Bully! Selfish girl!" She said that she really needed the job. So all the others said: "And I don't need the job?" She said that her husband was unemployed. Then everyone else started pushing, they wanted to get in front. Someone started screaming: "If she went in, so will I!" So she started pushing... and so did the ones behind her. Then, there was a loud noise... something like a "crack"... I started screaming... Luciana! Luciana! Luciana! What's going on? Do you feel ill? What were you thinking? Luciana! Luciana! Nando, I can't go on! Help me! What did you do? What do you want from her? You would like to find a poor girl... to take the blame for everything... to put on front of the newspapers... You could go home happy, could you? And no one would have to think about this mess tomorrow. Take her home, go on. Can we go home, too? Yes, go on. Commissioner, can we all leave? Yes, yes. As far as I'm concerned... the inquest is closed. Well, Commissioner? Well, what? My newspaper is waiting for an article. And what do you want me to do? Write it for you? I didn't mean that. But people want to know who to blame. You can't leave me empty-handed. Goodnight, Director. I'm staying for a while longer. Goodnight, Commissioner - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Good evening, Irene. - Bye. - Bye. - Goodnight. - Such a terrible thing. - I know, I know. - Now, the courts can decide. - Yes, but... What are you doing here? I'm waiting for the director. Why's that? The typist job... is it still available? Perhaps he'll hire me. You were looking for something to put in your article, right? There you go. How about that?
