Hello? Hello. Yes? Who is this? Who are you calling? Who am I speaking to? Wrong number. Who was that? Nobody. Did you pick a movie? Yeah. We're gonna go scary. Saw 4. Ugh, I saw that in theaters. It sucks. It's not scary, it's gross. I hate all that torture porn shit. How do you really feel? Well, I like Jigsaw. I think he kills people very creatively. But you don't give a shit who dies 'cause there's no character development. There's just body parts ripping and blood spewing. Who do you keep texting? I have a Facebook stalker. He keeps leaving me messages. Yeah, like what? Just stuff. Like, "Hey, what's up. You're hot. I wanna kill you." So delete him. I did, but he hacked his way back in. So report him. He's really hot, though. You wanna see? That's Channing Tatum. It is not. Is it? Yeah, from his Abercrombie days. You are being punked. Hello? Who is this? The more impatient version of the person you just spoke to. I'm sorry. You don't have to be a bitch about it. Of course I don't. Eat me. You hang up on me and I'll cut through your neck until I feel bone! Who is it? It's for you. Hello? Who's this? It's Trudie. Who's this? This is the last person you're ever gonna see alive. We a prank. Hang up. Why'd you hand the phone to me? You're the one with the stalker. Are the doors locked? Don't freak out. Let it ring. It's from stalker boy. He said, "Answer the phone." For God's sake. It's a joke, Trudie. It's probably Lexi or Karen. Where are you going? To make sure the front door is locked. No. Don't answer it. You're overreacting. It's a joke, Trudie, okay? Somebody made a dummy profile. They're just trying to scare you. Wait. Who is it? I said, who is it? Let's call the cops. "I dare you to open the door." No, Sherrie. Don't. No, don't, I'm scared. Hey, it could be anyone that we know. Lisa, Bailey, Wayne Or the hopeful long shot, Channing Tatum. There's nobody out here. What does it say? It says, "I'm not outside. I'm right beside you." You're fucking kidding me. What? That was so fucking stupid. Pure horseshit. The death of horror, right here in front of us. I jumped. It scared me. A fucking Facebook killer? You're kidding me, right? I guess now it would be Twitter. That'd make more sense. A bunch of articulate teens sit around and deconstruct horror movies... until Ghostface kills them one by one. It's been done to death. The whole self-aware, post-modern meta shit. Stick a fork in 1996, already. I like the Stab movies. They're scarier. It's not aliens or zombies or little Asian ghost girls. There's something real about a guy with a knife who just... snaps. It could really happen. I can't do it. These sequels don't know when to stop. They just keep recycling the same shit. Even the opening scene. There's always some random girl who gets a call and gets killed. It's all so predictable, there's no element of surprise. You can see everything coming. Did that surprise you? It's your own fault. Why? Because you talk too much. Now shut the fuck up and watch the movie. Oh, my God, I love it. I've seen it five times and it still gets me every time. You're kidding. I don't get it. Okay. It's like The Twilight Zone. Twilight Zone? A movie within a movie. I get that. But it's illogical. It begs the question that if the beginning of Stab 7 is Stab 6... then is the beginning of Stab 6 Stab 5? And, if so, what is Stab 4 about? You're overthinking it. Am I? Or did whoever make it just under-think it? There's a reason I don't watch these movies. I can't believe you haven't seen them. We live in Woodsboro. That has nothing to do with Woodsboro. I thought you said Stab was based on true stories. The first three, the original trilogy, is based off of Sidney Prescott... but then she threatened to sue them if they used her story... so then they just started making stuff up. Stab 5 has time travel, which is by far the worst. Don't we hear enough about this story every year? At least Woodsboro's known for something. Did you hear that? No, I didn't hear anything. I did. Jenny, don't try to scare me. I'm not trying to scare you. You do it all the time. No, I don't. Where are you going? I told you, I heard something. I know you're trying to scare me. I'm not. What is it? I must have left a window in my room open. Could you get that? Marnie? Yeah. Hello? Hello. Who is this? Marnie. Who's this? This is the last person you're ever gonna see alive. What? I'm sorry. I had to. You bitch. So not funny. Somebody falls for it every year. I don't see why you get off on this. Marnie? Marnie? Marnie? Good one, Marnie. Lights out, phone on the floor. You know, you really should direct horror films. Wherever you are. Let me guess. You want me to walk by an open doorframe so you can pop out, huh? Okay. Timing, timing is perfect. But you don't have the app on your phone... so you can't talk like Ghostface... can you'? Yes I can. Who is this? Not an app. Is this Trevor? Do I sound like a Trevor to you? Think of me as your director. You're in my movie. You got a fun part. Don't blow it. What movie? Same one Marnie's in. Only her part got cut way back. But you, you're the dumb blonde with the big tits. We'll have some fun with you before you die. I have a 4.0 GPA and a 135 IQ, asshole. What did you do with Marnie? She's on the cutting room floor. That's not funny. This isn't a comedy. It's a horror film. People live, people die. And you'd better start running. Marnie? What do you think? Well, I guess today is the anniversary. Kids. No, I meant the display. Oh. It's good. I told the owner I'd kill his cat if he didn't get it right. Nice. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stay alive! Shit! Sorry, Sheriff! Kirby. Hey, before you get in the car, you have to promise not to kill me. Why? What did you do? Trevor called me last night. Why is he calling you? Because you won't take his calls. He knows I have your ear and he wants to know. Know what? How upset you are. Look, can we just not talk about this now, please? Fine. Fine. Okay, so Trevor called me last night. He called you, too? He's worried your cousin coming to Woodsboro... is distracting you from knowing now Sorry he really is. That's inventive. Oh, God. By the way, have you seen the Grim Reaper? Angel of Death? What are you talking about? Your cousin. Sidney. Last stop on her book tour, first stop on her road to a new life. It's very dramatic. She's the reason why I love horror movies. I'm sure she'd love to hear that. If I knew her, which I don't really. Wherever she went, people died. Other people. It was never her. I mean, Stab is the wrong franchise for her. It should be Final Destination. Okay, why is Jenny Randall calling me? Oh, the other woman. Hello'? Hello, Jill. I can't stand Jenny? Is this you? What's your favorite scary movie? Okay, who is this? What does she want? I said, who is this? I asked you a question. What's your favorite scary movie? I'm hanging UP. Wow. That was original. I got a call like that this morning from Marnie the Carny. What? You just ran a stop sign. Sorry. The Angel of Death. Morning, Sheriff. Morning, Deputy. Joe. Morning, Sheriff. Looks like the celebration's begun. High school kids, probably. Yeah. One generation's tragedy is the next one's joke. Sorry you can never get away from this. You know, I wish I'd been old enough to be part of the force... when you were solving those crimes. It's those intense investigations that really bond relationships. Well, yeah. How is Gale, by the way? Gale's good, she's writing. Fiction. Hey, I made some lemon squares. They're in my car. Thanks, Deputy, but no thanks. Sheriff. You're not cheating on your wife if you eat my lemon square. Yeah, but I would be cheating on my diet. Sheriff Riley? Come in, Sheriff Riley! This is Sheriff Riley. Go ahead. You gotta get over to the Randall house right away. It's bad, Sheriff, real bad. The book is Out of Darkness and its author, Sidney Prescott, is here with us today. Have the seven Stab movies, all based on Gale Weathers' books about you, made it even harder to go on? I don't blame Gale. That's in the past. If I was a victim for too long, it was up to me to reinvent myself. So I wrote this book. Sidney Prescott, everybody. And rave reviews for her book, Out of Darkness. Come on, Gale, let's do it. Let's reinvent myself. Except... "I have no fucking idea what to write." Oh, is that new? This is the upgraded version. I am totally mobile now. Nice. Look... Oh! This is Hall Pass with Robbie Mercer... here with the luscious Olivia "Don't look at my tits, I have a mind" Morris. Here is my Woodsboro Massacre anniversary question: What is your favorite scary movie? Is that all you've got? Some stupid douche question? Yeah, where'd you hear that anyways? It's a line from Stab 1, duh. Hey, Charlie. You're a genre nut, Kirby. What's your favorite scary movie? Bambi. That's funny, Kirby. Completely unaware you exist. No, man, she wants me. Yeah, I wish, right? Asshole. I think Charlie likes you. And I like him. To tease, to torment, to make him squirm. You could do a lot worse, trust me. Oh, hi, Trevor. Bye, Trevor. Can we talk? Somebody cares about you over here, you know? Someone who made you really happy once. Someone who never should have let you go. When you're done with a phone call, you let someone go. Or when you take someone to the airport, you let them go. When you tell someone you love her and she gives you everything... and then you just go out with someone else, that is not letting her go. That's dumping her. Okay? That's... That's betrayal. Trevor Sheldon, denied, live on Hall Pass with Robbie Mercer. What is your favorite scary movie, man? I'll show you. And I began to believe myself that that was all I was, a victim, and that was unacceptable to me. So I sat down... and began to write a new role that would be my own. A role for a woman who could leave the walls of fear behind... and step back into the sunlight, out of darkness. Thank you. Okay, we're gonna start the book signing in a sec, buy your copies while they last. I'm looking at you, ladies... Gale. I'm glad you came. Congratulations, Sidney. I haven't had a chance to read it yet, but... know where you can get one. Dewey! Hey! Hey, Sid. Gale, you made it. What are you doing here? Sid, I'm sorry, I gotta do something here. I'm really sorry. Excuse me! This will only take a minute. I need you all to stay where you are and remain silent. Nobody leaves yet. The Sheriff thanks you. Can this wait, Barney Fife? I'm running an event here. Ma'am, this is a police event now. What's going on? Gale, this is police business. If you could just let us handle this... I'm talking to my husband, Deputy Judy. Listen, there's a phone we believe may have been taken from the scene of a crime. Deputy Hicks has traced its location back to these coordinates. The rest is need-to-know. I'm not "need-to-know"? Sheriff, it's ringing out here! There. It's coming from the trunk! Yeah. Dewey? Gonna need everyone to stay back! Not now, Sid. It's my rental. Okay, we have an official crime scene. Let's lock it down. Get that camera out of here! Everybody back. Please tell me this is a prank, Dewey. I'm afraid not, Sid. Come on. Get back. I just wanna see. Okay, essays are due Tuesday. "Why Woodsboro is the best..." Anything with an on/off switch should be off, that's the rule! Somebody wanna share? Jenny Randall and Marnie Cooper were murdered last night. What? What? Stabbed to death. What's your favorite scary... Shut up! Class is not over! That was fast. This week marks the anniversary of the infamous Woodsboro Murders. Two girls killed the exact day... local celebrity victim Sidney Prescott chose to return to her hometown. It all could be something right out of a Gale Weathers best-seller. And where is she now? Well, living right here in Woodsboro. Mrs. Riley... Hoss. First Lady. Perkins. Excuse me, Gale. He's conducting an interview. Great. I love interviews. You'll have to wait, Gale. Sorry. Can't let you in there. What are you gonna do, arrest me, Deputy Judy? If it comes to it. Civilian interference with a police investigation... poses many a problem in a court of law. Okay, listen to me, Judy. I don't mind that you're working with my husband... or that you even bake him those little treats as you do. But if you're gonna start acting like him... you gotta put a mustache on because you sound ridiculous. Gale! Judy! Gale! Deputy. Gale. Please. Sidney, if you don't mind giving us a minute... Sid. Hi, Gale. Dewey, would you please explain to Betty Crocker... that I have every right to be here? If there's been another murder in Woodsboro, obviously... What? That is not public information! It's all over the Internet, Dewey! It is? Yes! The whole world knows about it before me! She wants to be a part of the investigation, Sheriff. Hang on. Are you familiar with the phrase "I wrote the book on this"? Gale, with all due respect... I don't see how that pertains to... Because I wrote the book on this! The Woodsboro Murders by Gale Weathers? But you're not a reporter anymore, Gale. And even if you were... Don't treat me like I'm the media. I helped solve these things. Three times, remember? You and me. Together. But I'm the Sheriff now, Gale. Right? What? You're not gonna let me help you with this? I can't. All right, then I'm going rogue. This is what I'm good at, Dewey. This is what I know how to do. Your lemon squares taste like ass. They don't. They really don't. Thank you, sir. Sheriff. Yeah? We've got a couple high school kids in here. Two of them say they got threatening phone calls this morning... from the victims' phones. Names are Olivia Morris and Jill Roberts. That's Sid's cousin. Damn. Right in here. Hey, Jill. Sidney. Hi. Hi. It's nice to see you, even under the circumstances. You okay? Yeah. So two of you got phone calls? Yeah, us two. "What's your favorite scary movie?" It was the killer's voice. From Stab. Or, I mean, you know, from your life. I'm Kirby, by the way. I'm their friend. And the killer didn't call you? No. Is that a bad thing? Does that mean that I'm not gonna live as long as these two? No. Maybe. Of course not. Just" Just be careful. Oh, my God, did you hear that? I'm gonna be next! Dewey, I shouldn't be here. I should leave town. I'm afraid that's not really possible, Sidney. Look, nobody thinks you're involved, but everyone's a suspect. I'm sorry. And there was evidence in your car, connecting the killer to you. You may be a material witness. So, you'll have 24-hour police surveillance. That's comforting. This is Rebecca. Oh, my fucking God, Henry! Yes, it's true. Two girls butchered. Payday. I was so not feeling Woodsboro. I was like lame PR move, right? Well, fuck me wow. Best idea ever. Henry, I'll call you back. Excuse me, I have to geek out. I didn't get a chance to say something earlier, but it's such an honor to meet you. Thank you. Rebecca Walters. When I was a kid, it was all about Top Story with Gale Weathers. You were my '90s. Well, it's Gale Riley now. You gave it all up for love, I know that. How long have you and Dewey been married? Ten years. Just like your characters in Stab 3. Wow. Wow. I didn't mean bad wow. It just always seemed like more of a movie romance than a real one, because it was a movie and in real life you two would never be... Dug a hole. Climbing out here. So anyway... kudos on being brave enough to drop off the professional map. Any plans on revitalizing your tarnished brand? Listen, in about two seconds, I'm gonna "revitalize" your face with my "tarnished brand"! I still got it. She's so pretty. When you think about what she's survived, she must have scars everywhere. Her mom was my sister. I have scars, too. No one ever asks me about my scars. I'm sorry, Mrs. Roberts. She means knife scars, Mom. Oh! Well, fine. How are you? How's Gale? I'm all right. But Gale, it's been hard on her. Small town, small town husband. Not much to write about. You two okay? Well, I read somewhere once: "Just when you think things can't get any worse, sometimes they don't. Sometimes they get better." Out of Darkness by Sidney Prescott, page 220. I've gotta get going. It's nice to see you, Dewey. We've been through a lot together. And we'll get through this, too. Okay? Look up. Be cool. It's just me. Relax, relax. It's just me. What the hell are you doing here? There are cops right out front! No match for the ninja, baby. Anyway, what are you doing in the house with Sidney Prescott? I mean, that's like being on Top Chef with Jeffrey Dahmer. Can you please get away from the window? You have no right to be in here. Not anymore. Hang on. I heard you got a phone call from the killer. Is that true? What do you care? Don't you think you'd be a lot safer with me around? I don't trust you, Trevor. Hey. Then I'm just gonna have to make sure that you do. All right? Oh, sorry. I didn't... No, he's just leaving. It's my ex. Yeah. Her one and only. Hi. Hi. It's cool to meet you officially. I keep meaning to pick up a copy of your book, but... You're smaller in person. What? Nothing. Just, you remind me of... me. Lock your window, okay? Yeah. Good night. Night. Sorry about that. Just making my rounds before taking off. Great. Thanks. You don't remember me, do you? Sorry? We went to high school together. Judy Hicks. We had the same homeroom. And Drama Club, too. We were in Peter Pan together. I played a Lost Boy. You were Tiger Lily. I'm sorry, that was a long time ago. It's okay. You had a lot of stuff going on back then. Well, it's nice to see you again, Judy. You too. Four-letter word for courage? "Guts." That's Olivia Morris. She lives next door. She's on the list. She can live next door to me. Now seriously, Mary... I'm warning you, okay? I'm gonna have to get physical. I mean it. This is it! Fuck off! Hello? What are you guys up to? We're watching Shaun of the Dead. You know there are two zombies sitting outside your house in a car? Yup. They're cops. You wanna come up? Did the Angel of Death leave? No, she's in the guest room. Forget it. Next door's close enough. Your mom home? She's at her boyfriend's. It's creepy around here tonight. Well, the zombies are still in their car so you should be all right. Call me tomorrow, okay? She didn't wanna come up? She fears the Reaper. Watch this. Speaking. What's your favorite scary movie, Olivia? That's the worst imitation I've ever heard, Jill. Speaking of Stab, have you heard where the Stab-a-Thon is gonna be yet? No, and it doesn't matter to me anyways. My mom doesn't let me go. It's Trevor. I'll handle this. Trevor's calling. Again. What do you want? I wanna talk to Jill. No, it's Kirby. Sorry, Trevor. Jill is screening her calls from all past relationships. What's going on over there? Hang on a sec. What is he saying? I'm not Trevor. What? I can barely hear you, Trevor. This isn't Trevor. Oh, all right. Well then, why do you have his phone, whoever this is? He's trying to do Ghostface. He's being weird. I want to talk to Jill. Okay, well, she doesn't wanna talk to you. Come on, Mr. Ghostface, whisper to me. Aren't you supposed to ask me a question? All right. How's the movie? What movie? Shaun of the Dead. How did you know that? Because I'm standing in the closet. Stop. You are not. What's going on? Trevor's being weird. I mean, if it is him. I don't know. What? This is not fucking Trevor! Well then, who the fuck are you? Open the closet door. You do know there are cops all over this house? I think I'd have just enough time to slice someone open. I'll talk to him. What's going on over there, you guys? Sorry. I don't know. Kirby. Kirby. Come on, do it. There is no way you're in there. See for yourself. Kirby? Kirby, come on! Talk to me. This isn't funny. Kirby! Liar. I'm over this. I never said I was in your closet. Stop! Hoss! Help! Perkins! Shit! What'? Welcome home, Sidney. Preview of coming events. Why don't you come for me? You got the balls for that? Oh, poor Sidney. You think this is all about you. You think you're still the star. This isn't a fucking movie! It will be. These are innocent people. Spare me the lecture. You've done very well by all this bloodshed, haven't you? Well, how about the town you left behind? I've got plans for you. I'm gonna slit your eyelids in half so you don't blink when I stab you in the face. You'll die when I want you to, Sidney. Not a moment before. Until then... you're going to suffer. Sidney! Jill. Stay right there! Is she... Do not look. Okay? She said you were the Angel of Death. What's going on? He's in here. Where is he? Ma'am? He was. We'll check out back. Jill? Don't. What happened? Jesus! Hey, it's me, I'm here. Let's go. Let's go. That's it. All right? Jill? Oh, my God. Are you okay? Here, keep pressure on it. There's nobody back there. Oz, call it in. Right. Hey. Are you okay? You should look upstairs. It's all your fault, Sidney. You're just like your mother! Officer, get this people out of the way. I thought this was over! Leave her alone. I'm sorry about what I said. Do you wanna get that looked at? Yeah. What the hell happened? Okay. I saw him go into that yard two houses down right before. Yeah, and I circled around to cut him off. And? And I met Hoss coming from the other direction. He must've circled back around somehow. He's like a ghost. Chief, we're sorry. We feel terrible. All right. Get outta here. This is Hall Pass with Robbie Mercer webcasting live in our darkest hour. What began as a day of remembrance has ended with serial murder. Olivia Morris, who officially will never go out with me, is dead. So is Jenny Randall and Marnie Cooper. Our local legacy, the Stab movies, is coming to life. Excuse me. Are you recording with that thing? Live videoblog upload. He's webcasting right now. Mind turning it off? For a little old-school "off the record"? Can't. Owe it to my audience. Turn that fucking thing off. Okay. So, you two are the boys that run the movie club at Woodsboro High? Charlie runs it. I'm just V.P. In case he takes a bullet. It's called Cinema Club. So you must have a very unique insight into the movie buffs at your school. Maybe. What if we could catch the killer by working together? Two generations of cutting-edge journalists... intertwining our passions for media? What would you say? I love you. Very good. Now you give me your expertise on the gore geek scene at Woodsboro High... and maybe I give you something in return. Say a celebrity visit to your Cinema Club? By me. What about Sidney? What about Sidney? Yeah, you know her, right? I mean, you're friends with her. No offense, but that'd be a big deal for Cinema Club. A visit from Sidney Prescott? I mean, she's the star. Yes, she's Daniel Radcliffe to my J.K. Rowling. Without the book sales and the box office. Whatever. There's no broken bones. I think you'll be fine. Take it easy. 80, Sidney, ooh, ow. Anyway, long story short... Random wants to look you in to three more books now. See the blank line in your contract? You can name your price. And as soon as you're clear in this investigation... We're on the next plane to New York. I booked Today, The View, Nancy Grace, MTV News... Excuse me. Can I ask you a question? Did you read my book? Thought I'd wait for the movie. Book tour's over. Sidney. Accept your situation. You're a victim. For life. So embrace it, use it. I know you care about your readers. All those little downtrodden fucks... that just need a light at the end of their tunnel... so they don't jump off a bridge. And a lucky break like this? I'm talking 100% increase in sales, minimum. That's maybe a million more people get your message... and you get a ton more checks. Win-win. I won't be needing you anymore. Sidney. You're fired. Fired? Fired. Fine. "Have you even read my book, Rebecca?" The problem with Sidney is that she never gets laid. Or even a little shit-faced once in a while. She'll call me tonight and apologize. Just watch. She'll come around. Gotta just give her time and Sidney will come around. This is Rebecca. Sidney Prescott, please. I'm handling Miss Prescott's calls and appearances. May I take a message? You are the message. Are you writing this down? Yes, I am. It's kind of hard to hear you. I'm in the hospital with Sidney. If you could just hang on one second. I've got time. It's you that doesn't. You know, Rebecca, it doesn't sound to me like you're in the hospital. Sounds like you're in a parking garage. A dark and deserted parking garage. But if you want to be in the hospital, I'd be happy to put you there. In the fucking morgue! No! Help! Help! Help me! Cut and run, you fucking bastard! This is an ongoing investigation... and rest assured we're pursuing a number of leads. The less I say about that, the better. So, in taking questions... Sir! Dewey! Gale? Any comment on the fact that these killings seem to resemble... the pattern of the original Woodsboro Murders? Hon? Later. As I was saying... my officers are hard at work, and we just want the community to know... that we are very close to bringing this whole situation under control... Oh, shit! Get up to the top of the structure! Go, go! Everyone back! Stay back! All right, nobody move! Listen, I want a man on each stairwell. It's all under control, huh, Sheriff? What am I supposed to say? Listen, I may not be wearing a uniform... but I happen to have a lead and you don't. So let me know when you're back on Team Gale. Move it, amateurs! Okay, Cinema Club. We are now in session. Welcome. Tell you a little bit about ourselves. We are a sanctioned after-school activity... one rung below the Glee Club, two above Nintendo Wii Fit. And let me say just to our guest, Sidney Prescott... it's an honor. Beyond Jamie Lee Curtis, forget Linda Blair, I mean, this is the ultimate. Thanks. I guess. Um... This? You film your entire high school experience and what, post it on the net? Everybody'll be doing it someday, Sid. It's kind of the one component the killer's missing. What do you mean? Well, you wanna be the new-new version. The killer should be filming the murders. Yeah, it's like the natural next step in a psycho slasher innovation. I mean, you film them all real time, and then before you get caught... you upload them into cyberspace. Making your art as immortal as you. Not to implicate him. Who do you think is behind the murders? Well, it's a Stab fanatic clearly. Working on less of a shriekquel and more of a scream-make. Copyrighted terms, by the way. 'Cause all there are now are remakes. Only horror the studios green-light. I mean, there are still rules, but the rules have changed. The unexpected is the new cliche. Yeah, you gotta have an opening sequence that blows the doors off... dial up some flashy music-video direction... and the kills gotta be way more extreme. Modern audiences get savvy to the rules of the originals... so the reversals become the new standard. In fact, the only sure-fire way to survive a modern horror movie? You pretty much have to be gay. So why are you so sure that the killer's working by the rules of a horror remake? The original Stab structure is pretty apparent. Yeah, two kids killed in a house when their parents are away... And then the school's hot chick savaged beyond recognition. We all know where it goes from there. A party. Exactly. A party. Guaranteed third act main cast bloodbath. Fingers crossed on some nudity for a change. Okay, so do you know of a party that's happening tonight? Well, there's Stab-a-Thon. Staba-Thon? It's a movie marathon. All seven Stabs back-to-back. We do it every year. And it's tonight? There's a killer out there patterning his murders after the original movie. I know. It's pretty wild. Well, you have to call it off. Okay, I mean, it's Friday. I'm sure we're not the only party that's going on in Woodsboro. So where is this circle jerk gonna take place? So who's ready for this Q&A? No, no. I really want the location. You know, it's kind of an underground thing. E-Mail invites, pretty secret. What, you're not gonna tell me? Really? We're working together. Remember? So are you ready for that Q&A? Fuck you. Let's go. That was awesome. I feel like I'm under house arrest. You know when people say, "I know how you feel"... but you know they're just saying that because they really have... no frigging idea how you feel? I know how you feel. I'm so sorry about Olivia. I'm sorry about your publicist. How do you handle it? People staring at you all the time? People stare at me? I could never handle that kind of attention. I just... feel like it would take over your whole life. What I do is I... try not to think about me. I have people I care about and I focus on them. And the rest, it works out. You saved my life last night. I mean, I know we're family, but you hardly know me. It makes me wonder, you know, if... I'd have been brave enough to do the same thing. I really hope you never have to find that out. Well, if you need me, you know where to find me. I'll be up in my cell. Or, I mean, my room. Her room's all boarded up. That's the view from my cell. It's really weird. I think Olivia would understand, okay? She'd want me to be around other people. Holy shit. Even if I did just crash-land on Planet Dork. Speaking of which, Trevor's here. Hey, Kirby. What is he doing there? That is so not his scene. . I have no idea. Maybe he thought you would be here. Yeah, fat chance. After what happened last night? I mean, my mom is just completely freaked out. All right, look. You go do your "good girl" thing and I will drink for the both of us. I will keep you posted. All right. Be safe. Stab-a-thon! Stab-a-thon! Stab-a-thon! Thank you! Thank you! Gracias, gracias. Cinema Club thanks you for coming out for our third annual Stab-a-thon! Safety in numbers, my friends! Safety in numbers! Who's ready to drink every time someone can't get a cell phone signal? Yeah! Who's ready to drink every time someone shuts the refrigerator door... and, oh, my God, there's a harmless character right behind it? Who's ready to drink every time someone screams the word... No! Let's get this Stab-a-thon started! Yes. Oh, yeah. Back on my game. Perfect. New work-in-progress, chapter one. When I moved to Woodsboro, I never in a million years... dreamed that I would again play the critical role... in solving another series of these... What the hell? Gale, where are you? I followed the kids to the Staba-thon. There's an old abandoned farm on Fort Dillon Road. Listen, I've got it under surveillance, but... I think the killer's about to make his move! What makes you so sure? You do a remake to out-do the original, that's what the kids said. This party is all about the Stab movies. Come on! How meta can you get? How "what-a" can you get? I don't know. I heard them say it. Dewey, listen to me, you have to get out here! Come on, you catch the killer, I get the story. It's a win-win. Well, I thought you were going rogue, Gale. Oh, are you serious? Come on! Forget it. Thanks for having faith in me. I gotta fix my equipment. Gale! Shit. Bravo. Very well done. I'm very impressed. I mean, kind of. That will do. Yeah. Yeah, she wants me. Yeah. Hello? Hello. Who is this? Were you expecting somebody? No. You know, I don't even know you... and I dislike you already. Hicks, how far are you from Fort Dillon Road? Five minutes at the most, sir. Well, step on it. Gale! Gale, behind you! Gale! Freeze! Get out of the way, you morons! Gale. Okay, put pressure on that. Did you catch him? No. Hopefully your cameras got something. They weren't the only ones, Dewey. What? There was a webcam hidden up there. It was watching me. A webcam? He's recording the murders. What? This time... he's making the movie. Sidney Prescott detail, man. I don't like it. The cops guarding the house, they always get it. What are you talking about? It's a movie cop rule. It sucks to be a cop in a movie, unless you're Bruce Willis. Not all cops die in movies. No, but... if it's your last day before retirement, you do. If you're a rookie and just found out your wife is pregnant, you do. Or if your partner is better looking than you, you do. And by the way... I win that one. You know what, I'll take the next perimeter. I'll be right back. Shit. I know this one. You're not supposed to say that, are you? New decade, new rules. You know, these days you might come back, find me dead. Eyes gouged out, tongue sticking out. Could go either way. I gotta learn this shit. I'll take this one. Hey, Hoss. Be careful. I'm always careful. Dead man walking. Perkins, was there a window open on your last perimeter check? Perkins, come in, over. Anthony? Perkins? Fuck! Damn it. You should've seen the look on your face, rookie. Hoss! What the fuck? Oh, shit. Fuck Bruce Willis. Sorry! The wind chimes were over here. It was me. I was trying to fix them. Sorry. Just back from the store. You're shopping? My stress buster. I've got one more bag in the car. I'll be right back. Jill? You gonna get that? Roberts residence. You're a survivor, aren't you, Sidney? Your one and only skill. You survive. Well, I have one question for you. What good's it to be a survivor in this little drama... if everyone close to you is dead? Who are you? Turn on the TV to channel six. Who the fuck are you? Turn it on. Watch the teaser. But it nearly turned deadly tonight... with the latest victims of these attacks... being the wife of the Woodsboro sheriff, Gale Riley... AKA Gale Weathers... who's in serious condition tonight after being stabbed. Her assailant then disappeared in a sea of identical... Glad you came home, Sidney? Has it been worth it yet? Why are you doing this? Friends count. But it's the family ties that cut deep, right? Am I right? What do you mean? The ones you care about most. And what's closer than family? The bond of blood. Don't. You can't save them. All you can do is watch. Jill? Jill: Come pick me up. Kirby: On my way. Kate! Sid? Jill's not in her room. Oh, my God! She's gone to Kirby's. You gotta call her and get her back here. Okay. Come on, Jill! Leave a message! She's not picking up. What's going on? The killer called. He's coming after me. But he wants my family first. Oh, God, Jill! Let's get the cops. The cops aren't there. They were there when I first came in, but they're not there now. Let's get to Kirby's. Out the front! Brace it from the bottom! Can you? Let's get out of here! Kate, come on! Kate? Tell Joe, I'm so sorry. Hicks? What are you doing? I just saw somebody coming around the side of the house. Where are Hoss and Perkins? I couldn't get them on the radio. Whose blood is that? It's Kate's. We were just attacked. She's dead. Where is she? Front door. Show me. Okay. Stay here. This is Deputy Hicks. I've got a homicide at the Roberts residence. No sign of Perkins or Hoss. Copy that. I'm so sorry. You're gonna be fine, all right? I swear. No more "on your own." It's you and me, forever. One, two, three. Easy. Dewey? Yeah? Promise me something. Anything. Catch that motherfucker. Absolutely. I love you. I love you. You missed chaos. Utter chaos. I can't believe that. The sheriff's wife, man! She told us to cancel it and we didn't, and now this? What are we supposed to do? Robbie, calm down. It makes sense. This is what the re-boots do. They one-up the original ending. The Woodsboro Murders ended at a party. So in the remake... The party's the false ending. New rules. Exactly. Okay, no offense, guys, but I'm gonna put in Stab 7. Nobody cancels my film festival. Whoa. I don't wanna watch that, not after what happened to Olivia. Come on, it was her favorite. Wow, Kirby. You got some classics here. Yup. Suspiria, Don't Look Now. You know it. I could trivia your ass under the table, Cinema Boy. Oh, yeah? Who played Leatherface first? Gunnar Hansen. Wow. Did you feel that? That charge that moved between us just then? Oh, that was me. I have powers. So sexy. You guys are unbelievable. You're playing fucking trivia games? The cops are gonna come for us. They're gonna shut down my website. We're so dead! Yeah. I agree. Jesus Christ, where'd you come from? The front door. By the way, Kirby, with everything that's going on right now, you probably shouldn't leave that unlocked. Sorry. And may I ask what the hell you're doing here? What? Didn't I find the after-party? No, you found the anti-party and it's invitation only. I got an invitation. From Jill. So, what's the story? What? You sent me a text message. "After-party at Kirby's house." I mean, it was from your phone. What do you mean, from my phone? Where is my phone? I think I left it in your car. I didn't text him. I didn't text you. And I'll prove it. 80, Charlie, Robbie. How does it feel to be an accessory to a crime? I mean, really, Dewey's wife? My life is over. So which one of you guys sent me a text message from Jill's phone? We're just supposed to accept that you're telling the truth? Isn't your phone missing? Got a new one. Really? Oh, that's incredibly convenient. Dewey, it's Hicks. What's up? Kate Roberts is dead and Sidney fled the scene. What? What happened to Kate? She was stabbed just like the others. What about Jill? No sign of her at all. Where the hell were Hose and Perkins? They were found dead in their car two blocks away. Multiple stab wounds. Okay. I'm on my way. Yes, sir. Wrong number. Who was that? Nobody. Did you pick a movie? Yeah. We're gonna go scary. Saw 4. Ugh, I saw that in theaters. It sucks. It's not scary, it's gross. Charlie, do you wanna sit over here next to me? All right. All right. Get ready for a Hall Pass with Robbie Mercer extra. Now tonight, there is a good chance... that Charlie Walker, yes, my Charlie Walker... may get lucky with a girl. Now I'm unable to divulge my exact location... however... suffice it to say... that Woodsboro High may be in store for some geek history. We'll see. Hello? Who's there? Oh, my God! Hey, Charlie? Yeah? I'm sorry. I know you're into the movie and all, but... now would be a really good time to make a move. For me to make a move? Couldn't you make a move? I just did. 'Cause you're actually pretty cute. Especially when I'm scared and lonely... and drunk. Hey, guys, did you see Jill come in? I didn't see her outside. Yes, Trevor, she is upstairs. But thank God you're here to protect her when you can't even find her. There's nobody out here. Oh, dude, I love this part of the movie. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just when you think they're all safe and comfortable in the house... Ghostface comes in and bam! Did I just interrupt something right here? Shut the fuck up! Who invited you, Trevor? All right. Clearly not you. Wow. I'm gonna be upstairs. Laughing. Get out of my house! Okay, I'm a little drunk, so don't blame your internet connection. Let's see what Charlie's up to, shall we? Or the saga of Trevor and Jill. Oh, the intrigue of Woodsboro High. Who needs a killer around when there's so much drama? Oh, man. That's better. No, you can't! You can't! There's rules! I'm gay! I'm gay! I mean, if it helps. Kirby! I found my phone. It was up in your room. There was no text message sent to Trevor. He is such a liar. Where is he? What do you mean, where is he? He just went upstairs looking for you. He's not upstairs. Trevor? Charlie? Robbie? Maybe they're outside. Jill! Sidney! I'm sorry, I should've told you... No, it's okay. I need you to come with me right now, okay? Go! Come on! The balcony! There's no other way out? We can jump! It's two stories! Where's your cell? Here. Get under the bed! What? Just do it! And don't make a sound and don't come out until I come get you, okay? Trust me. You got it? You're okay? Jill, run! Keep running, get help! Hello? Dewey! Sidney, where are you? I'm at Kirby's. The killer is here. I need your help. I'm on my way. Sidney! I need all units to 329 Whispering Lane. All units, 329 Whispering Lane! Sorry, it's just me. Look, I tried to call 911, but the landline's dead. Someone smashed the router. I think I got through on my cell. Where's Jill? Oh, God! Go, go, go! There's a room down here. We can lock ourselves in. I heard you yell to Jill. Did she get away? I think she's safe. Kirby, let me in! Charlie. No, no, no! I just found Robbie. This is his blood. Please! Please! There is someone else out here! Let me in! If you can't trust him, don't open the door. My God, let me in! Get away from the door, Charlie. Kirby, it is me. Please let me in! Get away from the door, Charlie. It's me! I'm sorry, I can't. What the fuck? I'm sorry. Look out! Oh, no, no, no. Kirby! Oh, no, God. Please. Leave him alone! Leave him alone! It's Charlie's phone. Tell Sidney heads are gonna roll tonight. Tell Sidney it's all because of her. Or maybe she wants to take his place. I promise to be quick. It's him. Okay, I'm gonna get Jill. Just keep him on the phone. I'll be right back, okay? Let him go, please. I hear you like horror movies, Kirby. But do you like them as much as him? Forget watching Stab. You get to live it. No, no, no! He's the expert! It's not me! Warm-up question: Jason's weapon? It's a machete. There, you see? You do know the genre. Michael Myers? Butcher knife. Leatherface? A chainsaw. Please! Just ask Sidney if you need some help. Freddy Krueger? Razor hands. Name the movie that started the slasher craze. Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Last House on the Left, or Psycho? Psycho! None of the above! Peeping Tom, 1960, directed by Michael Powell. First movie to ever put the audience in the killer's POV. What? Wait. No, no, no. Please, just ask me one more question! Just one more. All right, Kirby. Then it's time for your last chance question. Name the remake of the groundbreaking horror movie in which... Halloween, Texas Chainsaw, Dawn Of The Dead, The Hills Have Eyes, Amityville Horror, Last House On The Left, Friday The 13th, A Nightmare On Elm Street, My Bloody Valentine, When A Stranger Calls, Prom Night, Black Christmas, House Of Wax, The Fog, Piranha! It's one of those, right? Right? I got it right. I was fucking right! Jill? I won, Charlie! I fucking won! He tried to beat me, but I fucking won. Almost there. Just hang tight. Okay. Okay. Okay. Kirby? Kirby, this is making a move. Four years of classes together and you notice me now? Stupid bitch! It's too late! I know, I know. It's okay. Take your time. Doesn't happen as fast as it does in the movies, no. Charlie. Kirby? You know, you learn a lot when you watch movies over and over... and all the plots are about trying to kill you. Where's Jill? You think she's gonna get away? You think anyone gets away? Jill. Hello, Sidney. Surprised? Watch this. This is the part, my dear cousin, when the cameras turn off. Charlie? Already taken care of. Man, I got great footage of my Robbie kill. Better than Jenny and Marnie or Olivia even. Good. We'll cut and upload it later and make it all traceable to Trevor. Speaking of which... Remind you of anything? Please! Shut up! Dick! Everything I learned I learned from you. You think you had a shitty boyfriend, Sidney? Here's one that fucks you, dumps you, and doesn't even make you famous. What the fuck, Jill? I loved you! Shut the fuck up already! I'm sure those cops want you to have this, Jill. For your protection. Please! Please. Shouldn't have killed all these people, Trev. Gone and put it on video even. But it means a lot that you did it for me. What the fuck are you talking about? I am not the girl you cheat on. Fuck! I've gone through everything. We're definitely good on timeline. Oh, yeah. We're perfect. No, no, please! Ready for Act 3? Got it figured out yet, Sidney? In keeping with our remake theme Trevor's this generation's Billy Loomis, and we're the innocent victims, Sidney and Randy. See, with you, the world just heard about what happened. But with us they're gonna see it. It's gonna be a worldwide sensation. I mean, people gotta see this shit. It's not like anyone reads anymore. We're gonna know fame like you never even dreamed of. Last two teenagers standing. This time Randy gets the girl. You were amazing. You're the perfect victim. I was so believable today, wasn't I? I mean, I told so many lies that I actually started to believe them. I really think that I was born for this. How could you do this? Do you know what it was like growing up in this family? Related to you? I mean, all I ever heard was Sidney this and Sidney that... and Sidney, Sidney, Sidney. You were always just so fucking special! Well, now I'm the special one. You'll slip. They always do. Come on, Charlie, let's get on with this. You have to be strong. And hold still. Okay? Yeah. Yeah, old school, like Billy and Stu. Come on, baby, get it up! Come on! Shoulder me! Shoulder me! Shoulder me! Get it up! Not the way we rehearsed it. You said it, Charlie. Billy and Stu. Trevor, and you. What the media really loves, baby, is a sole survivor. Just ask you-know-who. Trevor was your partner. But you, you were the idea man. Even your friends. My friends? What world are you living in? I don't need friends. I need fans. Don't you get it? This has never been about killing you. It's about becoming you. I mean, for fuck's sake, my own mother had to die, no great loss there, so I could stay true to the original. That's sick, right? Well, sick is the new sane. You had your 15 minutes, now I want mine! I mean, what am I supposed to do? Go to college? Grad school? Work? Look around. We all live in public now, we're all on the Internet. How do you think people become famous anymore? You don't have to achieve anything. You just gotta have fucked-up shit happen to you. So, you do have to die, Sid. Those are the rules. New movie, new franchise. There's only room for one lead, and let's face it, your ingénue days, they're over. Don't tell me you didn't know this day would come. Come on, let's move it! He's gone. Check the rooms, both sides and upstairs. Yes. Jill, can you give us a description of the murderer? Jill, how does it feel to be a hero? It's okay. You gonna be okay. Jill. You made it. That's all that matters. Trevor, Charlie, they tried to kill me. And I heard they killed my mom. And Robbie and Kirby, too. Just lay back. Try to rest. Is your wife...? She's gonna be fine. She's recovering. If I ever write a book one day, I'd want her to write it with me. We'd be a good team with our matching wounds and all. We're survivors now. I just wish Sidney was, too. Jill, they're not sure yet. It's still touch and go. But she's in ICU. And they think Sidney just might make it. What? But I saw Trevor kill her. Look, we don't know yet. But she's hanging on. I wanna see her. She's not awake yet. And she may not remember anything. You'll to help her with that. All in time. Just get some rest now, okay? She gonna be okay? Yeah. She's a strong kid. She's gonna have to be. She asked if you were okay. She thinks you guys should write a book together, with your matching wounds. Why, she was stabbed in the shoulder? How did she know I was, too? Dammit! You just won't die, will you? Who are you? Michael fucking Myers? Yeah, I don't think so. Fucking die already! How are those stitches? Sidney! Hicks, get into Sidney's room and call for back-up! On my way, sir! Sid! Sid. Dewey! Is this how it's gonna be, Sid? The ending of the movie was supposed to be at the house. I mean, this is just silly. Consider this an alternate ending. You're never gonna get out of this, Jill. Of course I will. Dewey! Okay, okay. What about the book? Looks like I'll just have to write it myself. Goddamn it! Don't even think about shooting, or I'll blow Dewey's head off. You think I won't do it? Give me your gun! Do it! You heard her. Just had to be the hero, hu? Gimme your gun. Give it to her. What are you, deaf? Give me your gun! Now get up. Keep your hands over your head. Don't do anything stupid. Don't fucking tell me what to do. Oh, God. Now get up, bitch. Okay. Get up. Now! She ist not gonna help you. Come on. Let's go. Get your skinny ass out here. Okay. I'm gonna enjoy blowing your head off. Okay. Can I just have one final word? What? "Please"? Clear. Clear? Clear. You forgot the first rule of remakes, Jill. Don't fuck with the original. Oh, my God, Dewey. What hit me? Don't ask. Are you okay? She was standing right behind me. They always are. Oh, God. Nice one. Hicks? You're alive? Wear the vest, save your chest. We got two officers down. Several injuries. And a new suspect. We need a doctor, goddamn it! I don't know about you, but I feel a whole lot better. We're live at Woodsboro Community Hospital... awaiting a first public statement from Jill Roberts, survivor. A survivor of what is now being called... the Woodsboro Massacre Re-boot. Jill Roberts is her name, a name the whole world will now know. Who single-handedly put a stop... to this 21st century Woodsboro killing spree. Jill Roberts of Woodsboro... a girl who's lifted all our spirits tonight. An American hero, right out of the movies.
