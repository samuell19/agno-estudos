- The one born from the vast darkness is a burning flame. A rising moon which wipes away the memory of daylight, the searing embrace of a dark power, dancing madly in a crazed storm. However, in time, even this storm shall pass. In its wake, joy and prosperity will vanquish despair, and the darkness will fade into the light. - If King Drasil gets his way, I think we all know what's going to happen. The human world is going to be swallowed by the digital world. - Hold on tight. - Tai? Where are you, big brother? The two of us, we've always been together. Sometimes you got bored. Sometimes I got angry. Lots of times we had fun. But you were always right there. You awake? Of course not. Hello, world to Tai Kamiya, wake up. Let's go, rise and shine. - Kari, Kari? - What is it, T.K.? - You all right? - Mm-hmm. - Just thinking about Tai. Where'd he go? - Look at that, guys. It just keeps getting closer. - I can see our school. - Can they see us? - Distortions everywhere. - What do you make of this, Izzy? - The line separating the human and the digital world is starting to disappear. - Couldn't that be a good thing though? We wouldn't need a portal to go to your world anymore. - I can go see Joe anytime. - It's not that simple. If this keeps up, there won't be a human world for any of us to visit. - I guess Homeostasis isn't going to stop King Drasil from reshaping both worlds. - There's no way I'm going to let that happen. - But what can we do? We can't even control Meicoomon anymore, now that she's combined with Ophanimon and her Dark Mode. She's grown more powerful than ever. Homeostasis wants only stability and harmony. That's it's only purpose. - That's what they always say. - So how are we gonna save Meicoomon. - Is that pink lava a portal, Izzy? - Not only that, it connects directly to the human world. And it's within walking distance. What do you say, Matt? Should we go home? - Yes. - Walking distance is far. - Yeah, only because we don't have legs. - But dancing looks like fun. - Not as fun as flying. When Tai through me in the air, ah, that was so much fun. - I remember that. I wanna fly. Throw me, Mimi. - When Tai comes back, he'll make us all fly. - Maybe we should talk about another topic. How about food, food's good. - Ah food would be good. That would make this walking distance much shorter. What have you got? - I've got nothing. - Well why do you wanna talk about it? That's not nice. - It's okay, you know? - Hmm? - I know you don't want to leave. Let the rest of us handle things back in the human world for awhile. You wanna stay and look for Tai, don't ya? - Well, yeah. I'd like to stay here, but I can't. Our world needs to be saved too. - Hmm, it still doesn't seem real, does it? What happened to everyone. First Meicoomon. Then Gatomon. And poor Mr. Nishijima was just trying to help Tai. It's like a bad dream. - I keep thinking Tai's gonna come around the corner any minute. And really tick me off. - Yeah, I wish. Just between us, can I ask you something? - Sure. As long as it's got nothing to do with ghosts. But maybe we should get going before everybody starts won-- - What happens if Tai's really gone? I mean, it kinda looks like he's gone. I know that doesn't sound remotely possible, but the last time we saw him, he fell into a big crack. And when it closed back up, he was gone. And I'm worried about Kari. She lost her brother and her Digi partner got turned into a giant flying feathered monster. All right, I'm done. And now you tell me there's no point in getting all emotional and we just have to buckle up and keep going. - Exactly. - That's good advice. - Sora! - Over here, Biyomon. - What did you do? - Hey, hey, everything's okay. - You've been crying. Was he singing one of his songs to you? They're awful and they don't even rhyme. - How would you know? - You sing in your sleep. - Oh Tai, I'm leaving now. Come find me again, in your world. - Thank you all for coming. As you know, recent Digimon attacks have resulted in power outages and caused digital devices to fail. Reports of hostile Digimon wreaking havoc on critical infrastructure continues to pour in from every corner of the world with no end in sight. These incidents are proof that our world is being systematically invaded by the digital world and we must act at once. We had hoped the military forces would not have to enter the cities, but it's clear that we are now past that point. Meiko, call me as soon as you get back. Where is my daughter? - Your efforts are in vain. The situation is beyond the power of humans to control. - What do you mean by that? What's going on? - The attempt by Homeostasis to eliminate the Libra has failed. During the battle, the Libra combined with Ophanimon Falldown Mode, this was not expected. The result was the creation of the Digimon known as Ordinemon. The worlds harmony is now utterly lost. - And Meiko, did the children get out safely? - No one was sacrificed. Homeostasis does not wish that. We must act before events spin further out of control. The time has come to execute the fallback option, our plan of last resort. - What does that mean? - If we do not stop Ordinemon, the human world as you know it is finished and nothing will remain of mankind. It's possible that the fallback option itself will destroy your world. But if we do nothing, then we remove any doubt about what will happen. Let us hope it's not already too late. - Well, we're here. - What's been going on? All citizens are ordered to clear the streets and public areas until further notice. A state of emergency has been declared. Repeat, all citizens are to clear city streets and public areas and to remain indoors until further notice. - At least that thing that Meicoomon turned into hasn't shown up in the city yet. - There's nothing about it on the news? - There would be, if it was here. - That's for sure. - So now what? We saw it disappear into a distortion. - Yeah, we did, what do you think, Izzy? - Unfortunately, as much as we don't want it in this world, we have to assume it'll come here. It's a very powerful Digimon. - This is all... My fault. - Huh? - Tai is gone. - Kari, no, no. Don't talk like that. - What if he is? Then what? Where's my brother? Please come back, Tai, please. - Mimi, when you cry, I cry, too. - Come back, Tai. - She fainted. - Don't let her fall. - Her forehead's so hot. She has a fever. - But she was okay when we got here. - It's all the stress. It got to her. - I guess you can say that every bad thing that's happened is my fault. Ever since Meicoomon went crazy, it seems like nothing's gone right for us. - That's not true. Remember that time we had cake? - Yeah, chocolate. - Lots of things have gone right for us since then, Meiko. But the future is what's important now. Not the past. I think she'll be fine if we just get her off her feet. Come on, lie down for a bit, Kari. - Tai or no Tai, we'll be okay. - I hope you're right about that, Matt. - Uh, Joe. - What's up? - Koromon's acting weird. - Maybe he swallowed a bug. - Bugs don't taste that bad. - Oh, you poor thing. You don't sound good at all, Koromon. What's wrong? - Maybe he's just super hungry after all those battles. - You know what they say about feeding a Digimon with an empty stomach. A gold banana is quite restorative and tastes better when someone else makes it for you. - I love that saying. Let's order in. - We have to eat two digi bars. - Pepperoni for me, Joe. - Good to see some things are still the same as ever. - Of all the things that have happened to us, Tai, this one might be the worst. I don't remember when the odds were ever this tough before. Why did you have to disappear on us now, Tai? How can I do this when I'm all alone? - Why would you ever think that you're alone, Matt? I'm with you. - Gabumon? - Tentomon was right, I ate and I grew,. So listen, it seems like you're having some trouble dealing with stuff now that Tai's not here. - You heard that? - But as they say, your Digimon partner has all the answers. - They really say that? - Nah, I just made it up. But it sounds like a real answer so it must be true,. Everything's going to be okay, Matt. You're gonna be a great leader and you're not alone. You'll never be alone as long as you have me around. You know you can count on me. I'll stay by your side no matter how bad things get. - Thanks, Gabumon. - Even if that Ordinemon blows up the whole city, or if you mess up and get us all deleted. - Huh? - Or if you get confused and we get lost and go through a distortion, only, it's the wrong one and we all end up floating around in space forever. - That's not gonna happen. - And when you get married, I'll watch your kids. And when you get old, I'll go for walks with you, I'll do anything for you. I'll even save the world. - Thank you, Gabumon. Thank you for everything. - Tai is still in your heart, Matt. - I know that. I think about him all the time. I think I understand what he was trying to tell me now. I just didn't want to hear it back then. What's going on in your head? This isn't like you. The old you would've taken action. - I don't know what to do. It's not like when we were kids. These days it feels like I see more but, I understand less. Is fighting the answer? It might seem right at the time... But maybe it's not. I still believe we're the only ones who can fix this. I'm just worried, what if we make it worse? - Oh spare me, look. - What? - Quit trying to run away from it. I finally realized how much I depended on him. It's terrifying to lose something irreplaceable. I know that now. Now that Tai's gone. - You have to stop thinking that way, Matt. You're just making it harder on yourself. You know you're the only one who can step up and take over for Tai. And you know that's what he would want. So, do it for him. it's all right, don't cry. - You're making me cry. Hmm? What are you doing? - Hmm? - Uh nothing really. We were just out for a walk and you know. - A walk, huh? And your walk just happened to bring you all right to that window at the same time? - Well, it is a very nice window. - Maybe it's time for a digi-spanking. Knuckleheads. - Matt? - Hmm? - Something's happening. - Distortion. - That's right, you have Tai's goggles. Put them on. - Here it goes. No way. Meicoomon's just reappeared! - Everyone evacuate the area at once. Everybody out! Everybody out! - The police cannot patrol down here, stay here. - Chopper later to group. Follow me and fly low. - Roger that. I can't believe those fools have created this monster. It's fantastic. They're doing my job for me. All I have to do now is stand back and watch. Do it, Ordinemon, destroy it. Destroy it all! Burn this rotten, useless world sown. Destroy these humans and everything they've created. And in from its flames and ashes, a new world shall arise. A new world ruled by King Drasil, hee-hee-hee. - Citizens are reminded to stay indoors and to monitor this channel for further news bulletins. - Has anybody heard from Tai yet? - Not yet, nothing. - Same here, I can't contact Meiko. - Things seem bad, but we have to trust our kids and know they'll find a way out of it. - Mm hmm, that's the only thing we can do. They're all survivors. I have faith in them. - Dance, my horrible monster. Just keep on dancing. Destroy everything, Ordinemon! - Stay on my six, we're going in. - Right behind ya, Japanator. - Keep moving! Keep moving! Don't panic, people. - Is that really Meicoomon? - How are we supposed to stop that? - I was going to volunteer to go talk to her, but now that I see her, maybe not. - Swallowing Ophanimon has made her a little more intense. The situation has gotten quite dangerous. - Oh Mei, now what? - Let's go, Gabumon. - Roger that. - Gomamon, Tentomon, Biyomon, Palmon, Gabumon digivolve to... - Garurumon! - Togemon! - Birdramon! - Kabuterimon! - Ikkakumon! - Digivolve to... - WereGarurumon! - MegaKabuterimon! - Lilimon! - Garudamon! - Zudomon, let's go. - What do you want? - I see you still prefer to wear that disguise, edging your bets just in case your little plan falls through. - Yeah, this war is as good as over. What are you doing here anyway? Come to eat some popcorn and watch the whole human world's last pathetic performance? - It's too early to predict what will happen. - You guys won't like the ending. - Homeostasis wishes for harmony and stability in the world. - Now this is getting bold. I think you need a new catchphrase. I mean, come on, you're destroying everything anyway, just like we would. - Harmony and stability are the opposites of what you seek. You seek only destruction and pain and fear. - You crack me up. You hide behind philosophy but you have no loyalty. It's not a half bad strategy. Oh no, our owner's being destroyed. - Ordinemon stopped its rampaging when it's partners appeared. Perhaps it still has some shadow of a conscience left. - So she's taking a quick break. She'll be back to destroying in a minute. Just admit it, Homeostasis has tried and failed. No one can save this world now. All hail its final destruction and the rise of King Drasil. - After her, everyone. - No effect. - We're gonna need to crank it up to the next level, you guys. Let's go! - MegaKabuterimon digivolve to... - Lilimon digivolve to... - Zudomon digivolve to... - Garudamon digivolve to... - WereGarurumon digivolve to... - MetalGarurumon. - HerculesKabuterimon. - Phoenixmon. - Rosemon. - Vikemon, arctic blizzard. - Garuru Tomahawk. - Star-Light Explosion. - Forbidden Temptation. - Giga Blaster. - Still nothing. - Incredible. Now what? - Our best shot didn't even make a dent. - What if we can't stop this? - Oh Meicoomon, what happened to you? - I can't just stand here and do nothing. - It's too dangerous. - You do not lack for courage, digidestined. - Who are you? - A messenger sent by Homeostasis. Fear not, I am here as a friend. - Mm hmm. - Hackmon and it's mega form makes it... Jesmon! - Huh? - That was you. - Yes. - you're not our friend. You're the reason Tai isn't with us anymore. - Take it easy. - King Drasil had predicted that the Libra would destroy the real world. If he was correct, then the key to destroying both the real world and the digital world must surely be what the Libra has now become. - Ordinemon. - It is now far stronger than all of you. But it cannot even control its own enormous power. And it has no plan of direction. It wanders aimlessly, destroying without purpose. In response, Homeostasis has implemented its plan of last resort. We cannot allow King Drasil to continue. - What is this plan of last resort? - It involves rebooting the real world. - Is that even possible? - A reboot? We already did that. - The reboot you initiated was only of the digital world. The programming code of that world and the real world are vastly different. But the distortions transferred data between the two and have caused damage to the real worlds code. The very structure of its basic code has been rewritten. According to my calculations, it will take only 94 seconds to rewrite all code and then the real world will transform back into the Quantum Sea. - The Quantum Sea? - We must prevent that from happening, for the survival of your world. - So the first reboot wasn't enough? - Does that mean our Digimon will lose their memories again? - No, this time we can avoid that by using the backup memory we made for them after the last reboot. The trouble is, a total reboots gonna reset every single computer and electronic device, too. It's digital Armageddon. - Issues relating to the everyday tools of human beings are unimportant. We are talking about the question of whether or not humans in the real world will survive at all. The reboot is the last hope for humanity. - We have to save it by destroying it? Will it even be our world anymore? - Oh, Kari, I wish there was something I could do to help you. So this guy thinks our planets hard drive needs to be wiped clean? Isn't that a little extreme? - What would Tai do? Would he believe him? - Well I'm sure of this, what Tai would be focused on would be saving people. And he'd work as hard as he could to minimize any damage. He'd find a way. - Sounds great, what do you think, Izzy? - I think it's crazy. Think about the electrical grid and power plants and the gas lines and the water supply and transportation and even medical services. Rebooting the real world would mean shutting down every one of those things all at the same time. And Hackmon says all that's unimportant. There's gotta be another solution. And I'm gonna find it before this reboot happens. - He has a point. - Just the same, the reboot will begin when Homeostasis decrees, but I do agree. Ordinemon should not be allowed to further damage this world. Could you lure it away toward the ocean? - But, but how? - Sorry, Meiko, but Hackmon is right. Meicoomon or whatever she's called is destroying everything and we have to stop her. Look, you have the best shot as her partner. Try to lead her away from the city. - Well, wish me luck. All right then. - Gather around you guys. We brought you some food, so dig in. - There's nothing like food to cheer you up. - Tummy so happy. - Yeah. - Oh, my eyes were bigger than my thorax. - Why do you eat so much, Agumon? - Because eating is the funnest thing there is. Plus I've got to be strong for when Tai comes back. - I hope you're right. - I'm always right about food. I wish I was as illogically positive as you are. I'm so afraid we'll never see Gatomon and Meicoomon again. How do you do it? Do you know some sort of secret to happiness? - Mm hmm, my secret is eating. - Oh, another dead end. I have to keep looking. If I could just figure out how to prevent the reboot from happening. I've gotta find something. Anything. - Hey, Izzy, can I come and join you? - Sure Tentomon, come on out. - You sure took off in a hurry. Is stopping Hackmon's plan that important? - I feel like if I don't, it's gonna mean the end of the human world. Then again, maybe not. You guys got rebooted and you're fine. - Wait, I got rebootified? Are you sure? That sounds like the kind of thing that would definitely leave a bruise. - It's true, you just forgot. That's the problem with rebooting. Your memory can get wiped out. That's why I don't wanna do it again. - Who's there? Is that you, Tai? - Mr. Nishijima, where are you? I hear you but I can't see anything. - Over here. - Over where? - You're all right. I'm so glad. - But, you're hurt. - Yes, I wasn't as quick as you, obviously,. - Don't try to stand. - Where are we? - Well, we're still in the digital world, but I don't know where. I knew it. This isn't random. Someone brought us here. But why? Impossible, it's them. It's Davis and Ken and it's all of them. Are they alive? - I think so. It looks like they're in suspended animation. In fact, there's something else you need to know. I couldn't tell you before. - Huh? - Davis, Ken, Yolei and Cody, the four of them went missing a long time ago and I always wondered what happened to them. But then that intel was classified top secret. Even their names were made confidential. And all related information was kept under seal. - Who gave the order to do that? - It was Director Himekawa. I didn't know it at the time but she was cooperating with King Drasil. So when these four learned about him and what he was planning, she made them disappear. In our last battle together, Himekawa's partner, Tapirmon was sacrificed. That loss broke something in Hime. I think that's why she wanted to reboot the digital world. She thought it would bring Tapirmon back. Nothing else really mattered to her. - Did it work? - I don't know. I don't even know if Hime is still alive. Having a partner Digimon can save a person or if things go wrong, it can drive them mad. If only I'd seen where Himekawa was heading, maybe things wouldn't have turned out this way. Sometimes your best friends somehow become your enemies. That's when the decisions get tough. That's when we do things we never thought we would be capable of. - Please kill her. Just do it. - Beware when fighting monsters, that you do not become a monster yourself. If you gaze long enough into the abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you. Sounds like that was written about you. - Wait, what are you doing? - Just a little program modification. - He's turned off their life support. - Yes, they don't have long now. But you can save them by transporting them to the real world, if you hurry. Because in a few minutes, this whole place is gonna blow, kaboom! We've even prepared extra slots for you. Wasn't that merciful of King Drasil? But wait, what's this? I only see one. How can we make such a fatal error,? I guess only one of you gets to go. I've been waiting for this day for a long time. A chance to finally show you how pathetic and powerless you humans really are. By yourselves you can't do anything. Without Digimon, you're worthless. How does it feel to realize that? On your own, you're nothing but clowns. The digidestined are a joke. You really should be ashamed of yourselves, you wannabes,. - Are you trying to stop it? - Yes, I've gotta kill the program. There has to be a way to override the sequence. Mr. Nishijima, see if you can find the root directory on that computer. - Right. Hey, Tai, I think I found a way to override the transport and stop the self destruct sequence. Go look at the controls inside the last cryo chamber. The empty one. - Okay. - Step all the way inside. Transport system activated. - Hey, Mr. Nishijima. Something went wrong. I'm trapped. - I'm sorry, Tai. But if only one of us can go back to the human world, it has to be you. It has to be. - Open the door. Let me out of here. We still have time to figure it out. Come on. - There's nothing here to figure out, Tai. But you need to figure out what's happening back home and make things right. You kids are the only ones who can do it. You just have to do the very thing that you guys taught me to do. To never give up. To believe that no matter how bad things get, there's always hope. I think I understand that now. Always hope. I have to stay, you have to go. - I can't. - Yes, you can, Tai. You have to help your friends. You kids are the future. Your generation will write the next chapter. Maybe for our entire world. Maybe for the digital world, too. So, dream big. I believe in you. - Jet calling Delta. You have friendly inbound on the bridge, 300 yards out to the east, over. - Roger that, chopper two. We have visual, over. Transport, you are clear on approach. Checkpoint, Delta, out. - Mei Mei, this is really brave of you. - Thanks for stepping up. - Well, I'm the right choice. - Plus we're here to help you. - You can count on it. - You say that but I'm a little scared we'll get swallowed up like Gatomon did. - Mm hmm, there's gotta be something we can do. I want Gatomon and Meicoomon back. - Oh no, look at the lights. The city's entire electrical grid is on its last legs. It can't take much more of this. Well, at least it'll be morning soon. - But we don't have very much time. Meiko, go ask Hackmon what he wants you to do. - Should I go try to talk to her? - No, that is not necessary. All you have to do to lead her away from the city is to walk away. Ordinemon will go wherever you go. - What makes you think that's still true? The Meicoomon I knew is gone. How do you know that creature up there even recognizes me after all these changes? - Homeostasis believes the bonds between Digimon and their partners are unbreakable. They can survive any transformation. - Assuming Homeostasis really is on our side. I have my doubts. - Homeostasis strives only for harmony and stability. It does not take sides. - Yeah, but what's that really mean? Cause in that big battle, you certainly took sides. You digivolved into Jesmon and tried to destroy Meicoomon. I'm sorry, I guess I don't have any right to question what you're doing when it was my fault for creating this whole problem in the first place. - No need to apologize. You are an innocent victim in this situation. We involved you for our own reasons. Personally, the reboot is not the course of action I would choose. - Poor Mei. - Oh, check it out, guys. She's on the move again. - Maybe Meiko can save her. - Almost doesn't matter. - What do you mean? - Even if she stops, our world is still in trouble. Homeostasis is obviously determined to go through with the reboot. - Yeah, and they think it's okay. They know the results will be catastrophic, but they don't seem to care. - It's not their home. King Drasil, Homeostasis , neither of them cares about saving our world. We're on our own. - If Ordinemon doesn't change back, then what's going to happen to Meicoomon and Gatomon? - But she's gotta change back. - I know I'll be fine. - It's Izzy. What's up? - Matt, you're not going to believe this. Davis and Ken Yolei and Cody just came back from the digital world. - Are you kidding me? - Huh? - I don't have all the details yet, so I don't know who found them or how they got out of there, but they're here. They're in a hospital and apparently they're all right. Can you believe it? They've been in the digital world the whole time. - That's crazy. Okay, keep us posted. - You're awake. Here, have some water. - Thank You. - How are you feeling? - Huh? Like I might as well disappear again. - Don't say that! I'll always bring you back. I wanna help you but you have to talk to me. Don't let the sadness win. Trust me, Kari, it's okay. I'll always be here for you. Always. - You're touching, I didn't see anything, I swear, I wasn't even in the same room. Ah, what's that? - Gatomon is still in there somewhere. I have to go. I have to do something. - Meicoomon, come here. - Ah yes, Ordinemon. Bring down all your friends to join our lovely party. Together we will destroy this world completely. Let the humans weep and wail as they watch everything they have built burn to ashes. All hail King Drasil. - Meicoomon, Gatomon, are you still in there? Have all the memories of your partners been erased? - Meicoomon! - Please remember! - I'm sure our friends are still there somewhere, deep inside. - Yeah. - But if it comes right down to it, we may have to fight them. - Yeah, I know. - Are you with me? - But I can't digivolve. I need time. - That's okay, because there's still a lot of things you can do. There are some things we Digimon can do that no one else can. - You're right, and it's time we went into action. - Hmm. - Matt will make the right decision. We just have to make sure that when he does, we're ready. - Hmm. - Meicoomon and Gatomon are still our friends, this is not gonna be easy. - Should we strike, sir, or give it more time? - Time's up, send the men. Strike Force Delta here, what are your orders? Target acquired, all gunships, fire when ready. I've got a clean shot, here goes nothing. - Chopper force, do not close engage target. Artillery units, you are clear to fire. Choppers, minimum distance, 300 yards. Stand off and fire rockets. - Stop it! - Why are they shooting at her? - How are we ever gonna rescue her now? All that firepower, and it didn't even slow her down. - This is Chopper three, something's happening over here. - Gabumon, let's go. - You got it. - Gomamon. - I'm on it. - Palmon. - I'm good. - Biyomon, you ready? - Let's do this. - Digivolve to... - Togemon! - Birdramon! - Garurumon! - Ikkakumon! - Weregarurumon! Digivolve to... - Chopper force, retreat. [growling[ - It's time, you good? - Yeah. - Patamon, digivolve to... Angemon! Angemon, digivolve to... MagnaAngemon! - There's so many of them. - How is MagnaAngemon supposed to fight all of that? - I guess he's not, does that answer your question? - You again. - If only you could see your faces. I'm glad to run into you, because I wanted to thank you. So nice of you to make my job easier. In fact, I have Kari to thank for all of this. You're the one who was so determined to stop Homeostasis from destroying Meicoomon that you kept your brother, Tai, from acting, and that solved my biggest problem. - Lay off! - So, now you see how not being able to control your emotions can lead to serious problems. You freed me up to destroy your entire world, and that's exactly what I'm going to do. Wait for it. Almost. He's here! - MagnaAngemon, no! - Oh man, is that all you got? I was hoping you could play at a much higher level. - Please, no! - Meiko. - It's showing me Meiko's memories, but why? - Gatomon. - It'll be all right. - I'm so sorry. - I'm just here to give you a message, Kari. - What message, Gatomon? Gatomon, what's happened to you? - This isn't about me. - Don't leave. - The bad things that have happened have been too much for Meicoomon. She's a gentle soul, and she suffered so much, more than any of us. She needs your help to end this. She doesn't want to be scared anymore. Listen to me, okay? All the light you will need is inside Meicoomon. - Gatomon. - Good, you're awake. - Did I miss anything? - Just some more end of the world as we know it stuff. - I saw Gatomon in some place filled with data, and she gave me a message. - What did she say? - All the light you will need is inside Meicoomon. I don't remember anything else. What do you think she was trying to tell me, T.K.? - Coming from Kari, it's probably some kind of prophecy. It sounds like one. Any idea what it means. - Nope. - She definitely has some strange powers. All the light you will need. Hold on a sec. I just got an alarm and some kind of countdown on my screen, I think the reboots about to start. - Can't you just hit the snooze button? - Time to bug out, Tentomon. - Hey, that's my line. - I've got you, WereGarurumon. - Get her, Togemon. - Go! - Get in there! Go, Ikkakumon. - Firing needle spray! Take that, you overgrown mermaid. - Multi fire missiles. I've got you, Togemon. - This is a disaster, nothing we do has any effect on her. - I've got you, Togemon. - No, you have to stop this, Meicoomon, please. There's gotta be something we can do. - Hang on, my friend. - Everything about this is wrong. If Tai were here, what would he do? - It's beyond your control. The reboot has begun. All suffering will soon end. Homeostasis will make certain of that. - Shut up! Stop telling us how great this reboot is. Homeostasis has done nothing to help us since this whole thing started. We're gonna save the world our way, without you. All right, Izzy, what do you got? - I'm glad you guys made it. Meiko, let me borrow your digi device for a sec. - Okay. - Just as I thought. I've been trying to figure out the meaning of Kari's message. All the light you will need is inside Meicoomon. - And what did you come up with? - Well, remember after the reboot of the digital world, how Meicoomon was the only one of our Digimon who didn't lose her memory? It really puzzled me. I knew what the reboot could do, so I had tried to back up all our Digimon's memories just in case. I noticed some of Meicoomon's code was mixed into Tentomon's. At the time, I just figured a digital glitch has caused it during battle, but later, I found some of her data in all of the Digimon. I just ran a complete diagnostic on Meiko's digi device, cross referencing every network and system and digital channel that I'm aware of. Take a look at this. This shows Meicoomon's carrying a massive amount of memory data from herself and from all of our Digimon. - All? Did you just say all? - So, their memories can get downloaded again somehow? Are Patamon's memories in there too? - All there. - You know, I miss Meicoomon. I like her a lot. - Could it be? - Hi. - It might explain why meicoomon was able to grow so powerful so quickly. She had all our Digimon's data. - Must have been crowded in there. - I found something else in here too. I'm positive this folder must be special. It's the only one that's password protected. For the sake of argument, let's assume that fear is what causes Meicoomon to change. Remember when we first met her? She was child-like and bonded to Meiko. I believe the code containing her gentle spirit and good memories was corrupted and replaced by frightening dark data instead. If Meicoomon's original data is in that folder, I can use it to restore the memories she had before fear made her violent, her memories of Meiko. - Well, get to it. I don't want to experience the mother of all reboots. - That's the best choice we've got. Nothing else has worked. Let's give it a try, Izzy. - But we don't know the password. We don't even know whose password it is in the first place. - Actually we do. It's Meicoomon's password. We need you to think hard, Meiko. What password would Meicoomon use? - I have no idea. - Did she has a favorite saying? Did you have any special nicknames for her? - Nicknames. - Why don't we try your name? - M-E-I-K-O. Okay, that's not it. Try again. Mei? Nope, it's not any of the variations of Meiko's name. - Think of some word that meant a lot to her. - Come on, Meiko, we're running out of time. - Just think back to when you first met. Maybe there was something you said that she would have remembered. Do you recall anything like that? - This is chopper nine. The creatures are everywhere, they're coming right at us. - What was the password? - I had forgotten, but it was the first word I had taught Meicoomon, and the first thing I said to her. Because she had just agreed to be my partner. Thank you. We're so lucky we met all of you. What do you say to our new friends, Meicoomon? Dandan. - Dandan. - Huh? Say what? - That's thank you in Meicoomon speak. - You tried to pull one over on us. - It's not Meicoomon speak. It's your dialect. - You guys, it's working. All the data's being transferred. - Model five report, what's going on down there? All units, hold your fire. I repeat, hold your fire. - What is all this? Is that Tai? I remember. I remember it all now. Tai. My partner. - It's all coming back. Matt and I went through so much together, and it was so hard to say goodbye. So hard. - Being with you always made me so happy, Joe, even though you didn't always understand why. - Oh, T.K., even when I was infected, you stayed with me the whole time. I remember now. - Sora, look at us, we were great friends, weren't we? Now I know why you were being so kind to me. Can you ever forgive me for being so mean? - It's amazing. We spent so much time together, Izzy. And you worked so hard to get us here. I hope our stories are safe inside your big brain. - I can't believe how lovely all these memories are, Mimi. We're perfect together. We're going to be partners forever. - Look, it's MetalGarurumon. - There's Vikemon. - And Rosemon. - Is that Pheonixmon? - There goes Seraphimon. - I see HerculesKabuterimon. They all digivolved to mega level and are flying to Ordinemon. - Kari, I see you. I'm coming back to you. Kari! - It's Gatomon. - What on Earth is happening, what is this? This was not expected. The awakening of old memories within the Libra has also given it new powers. - She has all her memories again, right? So, why isn't she turning back into Meicoomon? - Maybe it's gonna take a little more time for her to change. - It's not her size that's slowing it down, it's the size of all the data that's being restored. Years of memories created before the reboot are being recovered and coming back to our Digimon, as well as to her, to Ordinemon. Gatomon and Meicoomon's data will probably be the last piles to be recovered. - This is truly the power of the Digidestined. It's unbelievable. - Hackmon, stop the reboot. The data isn't completely restored yet. We just need a couple more minutes. If we're successful, the reboot won't be necessary. - Kari, help, it's pulling me back in. - Gatomon. - No way. - Ordinemon is trying to restore harmony and stability. - Less than two minutes until the reboot. Are we gonna make it? - I hope so. Ordinemon is heading for that portal. If she goes through it, we'll never see Gatomon or Meicoomon again. - Don't go, don't leave me. - Something stopped her. - Jesmon. - Gatomon! I'm coming, hang on. I'm right here. You're safe now. - Of course I am, I've got nine lives. - I guess Homeostasis came through, with only 11 seconds to go, the reboot countdown finally stopped. - Then we made it. - What a relief, I was sweating. - So we're back to normal again? - No, we're not done. - She's, she's still Ordinemon. Why didn't she turn back into Meicoomon? - It should have happened already. - All the data's there. there must be something blocking the memories from integrating into her fractal code. What's this? Losing all those memories freed up a lot of space. - What's so bad about that? - Someone is uploading new files to Ordinemon. It's King Drasil. - That's right. Say goodbye to your world and gaze upon the glory of King Drasil's paradise. - What did she ever to do deserve this? Stop, stop making her suffer. Meicoomon, no! - Run, Meiko. - I gotta help her. - Hey, Agumon. - I'm so happy to see you again. I've missed you. - You're late. - Yeah, sorry. But I'm here now. Let's end this. - Yeah, you got it, tai. Agumon, digivolve to... Greymon! Greymon, digivolve to... MetalGreymon! Metalgreymon, digivolve to... WarGreymon! WarGreymon, digivolve to... Omnimon! - Tai, don't attack Meicoomon, she's one of us. - Oh, Kari. - Don't do it. Everyone has both good and evil inside. I just know the good part of Meicoomon is still alive. You've got to find a way to make her remember who she is. Save her. - I hope you never change. You might hate me for doing this, but this is how it has to end. - We're no longer the Digidestined kids. Our destiny is ours to decide now. No matter how painful, we have to save our own future. - Tai, if you destroy Meicoomon, I'll never forgive you. But you're still my brother, and if you think this is the only way, then I'll battle alongside you. - In that case, I'll join the fight too. - Gatomon, digivolve to... Angewomon! Angewoman, digivolve to... Magnadramon! - Fire tornado! - What does it mean? Please be merciful. - Look, Omnimon's gathering the power of all our Digimon. - Whoa. - Check it out. - Look at that. - Pro... - Digious. - It's almost over. - Yeah. - Yeah! - Oh, Meicoomon, I can't save you. - Meiko. I'm here. - You're alive. - Mm-hmm. - Oh, I understand. - Dandan. Don't cry, Meiko, it's all right. - Dandan, Meicoomon. - Oh well, it was fun while it lasted. Such beautiful destruction. But there's always tomorrow, right? You can find a little child inside everyone. A little child is ready to play. Oh well, Daemon could be next, or even Diaboromon. - Matt. - Kari. - Well look whose back. - Tentomon. - I think I'm hungry. - No more fighting, right, T.K.? - Let's all go home. - Hi, Meiko. I can't believe it's been three months since you left and went back to Totori. The city was really a mess, as you know. All the damage is taking a long time to fix. But life is slowly getting back to normal around here. We heard Homeostasis finally shut down King Drasil. The other Digidestined kids who came back from the digital world are fine, but the people around here still don't trust Digimon very much. Izzy's working on a system that will let us go between the human world and the digital world without using any type of digi devices. Amazing, huh? I hope we can all go to the digital world together someday. That would be great. Until then, please take care of yourself. - Tai's going to cram school? - Yeah, Kari told me about it the other day. He changed his college plans. - Really? - He said it was because of something that Mr. Nishijima told him, how we have to create our own futures. - Well, that's one hell of a homework assignment. - What future do I want? Hmm. - If we really get to choose, then I'll head out to space. - Sora, I like your new hairstyle. - Really? Thanks. - Huh, is it different? - Brother, you are hopeless. - hey, they all came together. Yay! - Well, you gonna call or what? And don't say anything stupid. - Tai, is that you? - Uh, yeah. - How have you been? - Fine, everybody's fine. - It's been a long time since we talked. - Yeah. - It's good to hear from you. - Good to be heard. Did the box come? - Yes, it got here today. That was so nice of you. I certainly wasn't expecting you guys to each send me a Christmas present. Thanks. - You're welcome. - What's with the silence? - Come on, get to the point. - I knew we should have given him notes. - Tai. - Okay, okay. Listen, Meiko, I know we all went through a lot together. I think about it all the time. No matter what-- - Keep going. - What I'm trying to say is, no matter what, uh... - Oh come on. No matter what happens, we'll be friends forever. You think she heard me? - Oh, Agumon, I'd know that voice anywhere. - Maybe in the future we should let Agumon handle the phone calls, because he kind of wrapped up the way everybody here feels about you, Meiko. - Aww. - So heart wrenching. - Thanks, dandan. - Look, it's snowing. - So pretty. - Can I talk to Mei Mei, next? - No, me first. - Hey, what about me? - Hand over that phone. - No way. - Good luck. - I never get to talk, not a word this whole episode. - Gomamon. - You guys. é\
