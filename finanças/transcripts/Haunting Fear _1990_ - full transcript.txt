[MUSIC PLAYING] Father. [SCREAMING] [WATER GURGLING] [TICKING] Well, the coffee smells good this morning. Oh, gee. Babe. Babe. Wake up, honey. Honey, wake up. Sweetheart, are you all right? Huh? Yeah, I guess so. I'm tired. Yeah. I-- another bad night, huh? Vicky, you got to go down and see Dr. Carlton. Dr. Carlton? He was-- Oh, come on, come on, come on. Vicky, come on. Get up here. Look, this nonsense with Dr. Carlton has got to stop. Do you understand me? My god, you're not a little kid anymore. You're a grownup. Why don't you start acting like it? You don't understand. You have never understood. I know what you're going to say to me, Vicky. It's what you have always said, all right? But Dr. Carlton did not kill your father. My god. He did everything he could to save him. And he knows what's best for you. You think so? Honey, I know so. There is nothing he can do for me. Vicky, Dr. Carlton has been taking care of your whole family for years. He can help you if you let him. At least he can lead you in the right direction. Terry, I'm afraid. The dreams-- Vicky, you cannot keep going on like this. Look at you, honey. You are a mess. Here's what I want you to do. I want you to rest this morning. And then this afternoon, I want you to go see Dr. Carlton. OK? OK? All right. This afternoon. Great. I'm running late. I-- I gotta go. I got a big meeting this morning. It could be big. Wish me luck. Good luck. I'll see you tonight, honey. Give my best to Dr. Carlton, honey. [WATER BUBBLING] You look a little overstressed for so early in the day. I'm tired. You know, Vicky just wanders the house all night long. I lay there pretending to be asleep, hoping maybe she'll come back to bed. But it's no use. You should lay down for a while. No time. If I don't finish this report by the 15th, it's my butt. I don't understand why you continue to put up with her. It's one thing for her to be driving herself crazy, but now she's pulling you down with her. I know. I know. I'm beat. But I can't leave her. You mean you can't afford to. Sales haven't been good lately. Only the worst in years. And they're not going to get any better unless you start taking care of yourself. Well, what would you suggest? Let's take a break. How long before my next appointment? Long enough. Tell me you like that. Tell me. Don't stop. Yeah, I know that's the way you like it. I'll tell you how I like it. Just shut up. Harder, Terry. Yes, Terry. Bite my neck. Yes. Oh, Terry. Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Come on. That's the you do it with Vicky? That's not good enough. Come here, you little bitch. Let's finish it, Terry. [PHONE RINGING] DR. CARLTON: I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. It's been a very busy morning. You know how that is. I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to see you. You know, you haven't been in this office since, uh, um-- well, it's been a long time, hasn't it? I suppose so. Here. Sit down. [TICKING] [RATTLING] Tell me, how's that husband of yours? Terry? He's fine. Working a lot, but he likes to stay busy, you know? Hmm. I can imagine. And about yourself, how are you? You look a little tired. Are you sleeping all right? Well, I probably wouldn't be here if I were fine, would I? Well, I suppose not. Well, tell me, what's the problem? Maybe I can help. I'm only here because Terry made me promise. Oh, I see. Well, why don't you try me anyway? I might do you some good. I'm having dreams, dreams that won't let me sleep, nightmares. About your father? No. Well, not all of them. They're about death, all right. But it's me inside, trapped inside a dream with no escape. Most of the time, I'm being buried alive. Buried alive? You mean, prematurely? I know it sounds crazy. But it's only a dream, right? Yes, that's right. Well, I've been buried alive, and I wake up in the coffin. It's black inside, but I can still see. And I can hear my heart beating in my ears like a drum. I scream, but no one can hear me because I'm so far underground. And it's cold, deathly cold and quiet. I scream, and then I claw at the coffin lid until my fingernails are broken and torn, raw and bloody from the frantic scratching and digging into the hardwood of the casket. Nothing happens. No one can help me. And I scream and scream. And then I wake up. How long have these dreams been bothering you? About a year, I guess. They don't come every night but often enough. Victoria, do you have any crazy notion that your father was buried alive? I'll tell you what you do. Take this prescription, get it filled at your drug store, follow the directions, and it'll make you sleep without the dreams. I guarantee it. Thank you. I want to see you again in a week, OK? Sooner if need be. Ah, Vicky fried chicken. You know I love that stuff. I'm sorry about this, but I was late getting back from town today. Oh, this is fine. This is fine. Come on. Let's eat. So saw Dr. Carlton today, huh? Yeah, I saw him. Well, how was the old dinosaur? Not quite extinct yet, I'm afraid. That's funny. What did he say? He didn't say anything. He just gave me a prescription for sleeping. Drugs? Fantastic. It'll probably knock you out real good. You'll be sawing logs for days. I think that's the idea. TERRY: You know, tomorrow's Saturday. You could sleep in all day if you want. VICKY: Terry? Mm-hmm? Is it still possible for a person to be buried alive? I don't know. Maybe in India or one of those weird countries. Definitely not here. Why's that? Because here, you have to be embalmed or cremated or something like that. See, that's the law. If anything happens to me, I don't want to be embalmed or cremated. OK, honey. If you die, and friends come over to visit you, I'll just say that you took a long trip. And meanwhile, I'll put you on some shelf in the cellar. Would you? Vicky, god, come on. [KNOCK ON DOOR] I think I'm gonna turn in early. Unless you wanna fool around or something. No, you need your sleep. Go ahead. I got a ton of paperwork to do anyway. Yeah, I saw your briefcase. I can't figure it out. No matter how much work I do at the office, it's like I never get enough done. Too much distractions, I guess. Hey, hey, wait a minute. Are you sure you should be taking those pills with alcohol? It'll be fine. Don't worry. Good night, Terry. Good night, baby. Sleep well. Honey, you awake? (SING-SONG) Vicky. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? TERRY (ON PHONE): Hi, baby. Terry. I was just thinking about you. Dr. Carlton gave Vicky some sleeping pills. It's going to knock her out all night long. I can be there in about 20 minutes. I'll be waiting. Honey? I forgot some papers. I have to go down to the office and pick them up. I won't be long. [GASPING] Vicky? Oh, my god. She's dead. Oh, I better call Dr. Carlton. VICKY (VOICEOVER): Terry, why are you saying that? Something to do with the sleeping pills. Oh, she must have had a bad heart, just like her old man. VICKY (VOICEOVER): What's happened to me? Help me. I better call the doc. Yeah, that's-- that's what I have to do. VICKY (VOICEOVER): Where are you going? Don't leave me here. I'm afraid. Please come back. I'm not dead. Don't you understand? I'm not dead. I'm alive. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? TERRY (ON PHONE): Dr. Carlton. Yes? This is, uh, Terry Munroe, Vicky's husband. Oh, yes, yes, Terry. How's your wife doing? Oh, Doc, she's dead. A heart attack, I think. Uh, maybe from the medicine that you prescribed. Oh, no. I'd hardly think so. Look, I'll be right over. Are you still in the same place? Yeah. Victoria's dad's place. DR. CARLTON (ON PHONE): Right. I'm on my way. VICKY (VOICEOVER): Why is he calling Dr. Carlton? He must know I'm still alive. I'm young and alive. The blood is racing through my veins. Why did he say I had died? It isn't true. [PHONE RINGING] TERRY (ON PHONE): Honey, you'll never guess what happened. Surprise me. You can't make it. Oh, better than that. Vicky had a heart attack. Heart attack? Is she-- Dropped over dead, just like her old man. Must've been the doc's prescription or something. I guess it was too strong for her. Then we're free of her at last? TERRY (ON PHONE): Oh, not only that. I'm in direct line for her old man's property. You know what? This house will be mine now. What a fortunate turn of events. I think this calls for a hot tub session of some kind. Yeah, yeah, but not right away. I mean, you know, there's funeral arrangements. I got to act sad and all that shit. Uh, tell you what. I can probably make a little business trip, say, Tuesday? I'll start packing my toys. [DOORBELL RINGS] I'll call you back. Oh, Doc, thanks for coming. I got here as soon as I could. Uh, may I see her? VICKY (VOICEOVER): Surely, he'll know. He'll know I'm not dead. My eyes will show him. You see, don't you? I'm sorry, Terry. It looks like massive heart failure. I knew it. God. Well, at least it was quick. Conditions similar to her father's. Nobody could have helped him either. VICKY (VOICEOVER): Don't be an idiot. I'm not dead. Check my breath, my pulse, anything. Well, now what? Well, I've already called the coroner. They're sending a morgue wagon on the way over. If I were you, I'd fix myself a drink, a strong one. Doc, I can't drink at a time like this. Maybe you'd better wait in the other room. OK. Oh, poor Victoria. VICKY (VOICEOVER): God, why can't you hear me? What do I have to do to make you understand? Are you all blind? It's happening, just like in the dream. It's happening. He can tell. He knows. Both of them must have felt how warm my body is. You know for sure, don't you? I guess you get used to seeing death, huh, Doc? Yeah, but it's not always this personal. VICKY (VOICEOVER): Oh, god. Where am I now? Will no one realize I'm still breathing? My heart is still beating. I'm paralyzed, that's all. It could happen to anyone. Please look at me. Know that I'm alive. Please. A pretty one, aren't we? Young too. Such a shame. We don't get them in here so young usually. But if we do, it's because of some horrendous auto accident, and then they're not so pretty. But you-- you're nearly perfect, unmarred and beautiful. I'd almost say you're still warm. VICKY (VOICEOVER): My pulse is still beating. Check it. You'll see. Check it. Time to pump out your blood, Victoria. VICKY (VOICEOVER): Jesus, no! No rigor mortis. How wonderful. This won't hurt a bit. Now for the unpleasantries. Time for the autopsy. [GASPING] [SCREAMING] Terry? Terry, please help me. Terry? [WATER GURGLING] [TICKING] [CREAKING] [THUD] Vicky. Ah! What the hell are you doing? I had a dream. It was horrible. And then I woke up, but I couldn't find you. I heard a noise. I came downstairs. Listen, honey. Honey, I just went down to the garage to get my paperwork. That's all. I thought after those pills that the doctor gave you, you'd be knocked out cold. I'm sorry, Vic. I shouldn't have left you. It's all right. How could you have known? I've got some coffee brewing in there. Why don't we go check it out, huh? Come on. DR. CARLTON: This nightmare situation is becoming intolerable for you. I can tell. I'm living it, even when I'm awake now. I'm sorry the medication didn't achieve all we had hoped for. But there are other things we could try. Such as? Well, have you thought of taking a short trip? Get out of town for a few days, relax. We can't. Terry's job keeps him constantly tied up. What little free time we do have goes into fixing up the old house. I've been meaning to talk to you about that house. Do you think that perhaps living in your father's house has anything to do with these bad dreams? You think the house is haunted by my father? My father wanted only the best for me, and he trusted you. If anything, he'd be trying to warn me. Oh. Victoria, you still harbor suspicion and hostility towards me, don't you? Let's just say I'm unsure. Unsure? Look, Victoria, your father was one of my oldest and best friends. The money he left me in his will was out of that friendship. Now surely, you don't think I'd harm him for that. Oh, for god's sake, I tried to save his life. By injecting adrenaline into his Heart That's the only thing I could think of to do. It killed him. It did not. You're wrong about me, Victoria, very wrong. Am I? DR. CARLTON: Yes. But you won't be convinced of that. You're going to have to learn that on your own. I'll work on it. MAN (ON TAPE): I feel very relaxed because I see an image of my mother. She's on the bank of this river. [PHONE RINGING] And I'm floating. I'm going farther and farther down the river. And it fee-- Hello? DR. CARLTON (ON PHONE): Hello, uh, Dr. Harcourt? This is Richard Carlton. Uh, Carlton? DR. CARLTON (ON PHONE): Yes. We met at a doctors seminar on paranormal psychology last March. Oh, yes. You gave a very interesting lecture. DR. HARCOURT (ON PHONE): Thank you. Um, I've got a patient that I think might be of some value to you and your work. Really? Um, what seems to be the problem? Well, it's a young woman chock-full of neuroses, bad dreams, paranoia, the whole works. I see. And you think hypnosis might be the Key Exactly. That's why I'm calling you. Your work in clinical hypnosis pegs you for the job precisely. Perhaps I could help you if you'll fill me in. Can I help you? Lieutenant James Trent, Metro. Is there a problem? Maybe. You mind if we talk inside? It's quite a place. Could you please tell me what's wrong? Mrs. Munroe, I-- How do you know my name? Excuse me, please. We've-- we've had some reports of screaming here at night. I had a bad dream. The reports said it happened more than once. Maybe your neighbors. OK. I've had more than a few nightmares. No problem. We were just maybe concerned that you were being abused. Spouse abuse is not uncommon, even among the best of families. I can assure you, Mr. Trent, that is not the case. It's my job to check these things out. Thanks for your concern, but-- This is quite a place you've got here. My father left it to me. You mind if I have a look around? Old houses really fascinate me. No, I guess it wouldn't hurt. Quite a lot of stairs, I know. This is the third floor. This is the bedroom. Everything's the same, except for the furniture. I guess you don't get much use out of this room. Excuse me? Being awake most nights and all. Yes, you're right. Do you ever think of selling this place? It could bring a lot of money. Money would be really useful to a young couple. No, I really haven't. It's all my father left me, and I grew up here. I know it'll take a lot to fix it up, but I couldn't bear to sell it. Yeah, I understand. These old houses sure are great. Maybe I'll check in in a few days to make sure everything's all right. Thanks, but I'm sure I'll be all right. I'm seeing my doctor, and he's going to help me through this. I sure hope so, Victoria. Come on, baby. You f-- come on, come on, come on. You don't have to do that, you know. I can type too. Well, this report's confidential. Even for you. Really? Well, what is it, some new merger or forced takeover? Well, if I told you, Lisa, it wouldn't be confidential, now would it? It couldn't possibly have something to do with the $80,000 you owe Mr. Visconti, could it? How'd you find out about that, huh? What are you doing, Lisa? You going through my private papers now? It's not beyond me. But I didn't have to this time. You see, somebody from his organization stopped by this morning before you came in and pretty much laid it out for me. What did they say? They said, next Friday. And that's all? That's enough. Son of a bitch. It's a shoe in. Good afternoon, Mr. Visconti. Trent. How the hell are you? Great. So what's happening with our boy? Is he ready to pay up yet? I don't know. I gave him till Friday. Have to wait and see. You keeping an eye on his place? Not much activity over there. He's got a nice looking old lady. Look, you stay away from the broad. Just stick to your contract, huh? I'm watching him like a hawk. He's not going anywhere. Well, you make damn sure he doesn't. What are you hanging around here for? Get back to work. Anything you say, Mr. Visconti. God, I love this business. What are those? Vicky's old man's stock certificates. Jesus. Check it out. There must be $40,000, $50,000 worth of commodities here. Can you cash them in? Not a chance. They're in her name. I can't touch them without her signature. Why don't you just tell her the truth? You need the money, and she needs you. Listen, I swore off gambling a couple of years ago, OK? I can't go crawling to her for the money now. The house is in your name too. You're her husband. Demand it. I'm afraid it just doesn't work that way. [PHONE RINGING] Yeah? TERRY (ON PHONE): Uh, Mr. Visconti? Terry Munroe here. Munroe? My private line too. What a champ. Listen, uh, Mr. Visconti, I know I'm into you for a lot of money here. But I'm afraid I'm going to need a little more time, see. Time? I'm giving you more time. Next Friday, I think. No, listen, I just need a little extension here, just a few more weeks, OK? No dice, Munroe. You were in such a hurry to borrow the money. What if I'd said, I need more time? What kind of a deal would that be? No, I don't think so. All I'm asking for here is-- is just-- MR. VISCONTI (ON PHONE): Friday, Munroe. I'll see you next Friday. Got it? I got it. But you-- [DIAL TONE] There are only a few options left. Some of them, very unpleasant. Lieutenant Trent. What a surprise. What brings you around here again? I swear to god I haven't screamed all afternoon. Nothing like that. I was just patrolling your neighborhood, thought I'd stop by to see what you're up to. I didn't realize plainclothes men patrolled neighborhoods. I was really killing time till I got off my shift. I live close by. I see. I'm just a time waster for you. Actually, I thought I could get you to wrassle up a cup of coffee or something. I really did enjoy talking to you the other day. Sorry, I never make coffee after sunrise. You know, I never met your husband. What's he like? Busy most of the time but otherwise OK. You're way too pretty. If I were him, I wouldn't let you out of my sight. Mr. Trent, you're too flattering. It's just the facts, ma'am. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? LISA (ON PHONE): Hi. Is Terry home? No, he's not here yet. Who's this? LISA (ON PHONE): This is Lisa, his secretary. Is this Vicky? Yes. Can I take a message? He's probably somewhere between the office and here. You know, traffic. LISA (ON PHONE): Boy, this connection's really bad. I'm on a cordless phone in the backyard. LISA (ON PHONE): Oh, that must be it. Have him call me, OK? Did you get that? What a lousy connection. Have him call me. It's important. Jesus Christ. TERRY: Vicky? What are you doing, digging your way to China? Huh? Planting a little. Uh-huh. Mm, you have a wonderfully earthy smell about you. Do you see anything there? Yeah. You're doing a great job, honey. Your girl called a few minutes ago. My girl? Lisa what's-her-name from your office. Yeah, and what does she want? She just said it was important, that you should call her. Yeah? Was she still at the office? She didn't say. Hey. The connection was pretty awful. Oh. Come here. I want to talk to you. Have a seat, darling. Listen, I talked to Dr. Carlton today. And he said that he'd been ringing you all afternoon, and there's no answer. I don't know what he's talking about. Well anyway, he wants to come over tonight to talk to us. Why is that? Hmm. He has this hypnotist lady that thinks maybe she can help you. Help me? Well, sure. You know, help you to sleep, knock out those dreams, maybe find out what's making them happen. What do you say? Well-- Baby, come on. It can't hurt. If you think it'd be OK. It'll be fine. You'll see. LISA (ON PHONE): Hello? This is Terry. What's up? LISA (ON PHONE): Nothing urgent. I just wanted to tell you I love you. I told you never to call me here. But I had to. I miss you. Stop it, will you? I get lonely playing with myself. Can't you come over and play with me? No. I have to go. LISA (ON PHONE): You know, I was thinking about Mr. Visconti a little while ago. I think I have another solution to this problem. Make it quick, Lisa. LISA (ON PHONE): It's easy. You get your wife to sign the mortgage to your house, and all your problems will be solved. No, no. She'd never go. This-- this place is all her father left her. There's no chance she's gonna lose it now. If she were dead, you could mortgage the house. And there'd be lots of money for everyone. You're insane. You're wrong, Terry. She's insane. You said so yourself. And she has a bad heart. I would help you. We could do it together. I don't want to hear any more about this. Do you understand? Remember, nobody fucks you like I do. Nobody. Terry? Yeah, baby? Were you on the phone? Mm-hmm. Wrong number. That's funny. I didn't hear it ring. I caught it right away. Can I get you something, honey? It was-- well, the bath was so wonderful. I thought maybe, you know-- Dr. Carlton won't be along for an hour or so. OK. Go on up. I'll be right there. Terry? Yeah, baby? Do you still find me attractive? Well, that's a silly thing to say. Of course I do. You're my baby. I know I haven't been much of a wife to you lately. Oh now, I don't want to hear that. Come on. If I had any complaints, you would have heard from me. You know me. I just feel so distant, so alone. It must sound silly. TERRY: Shh. No. I understand. And I'm here for you now. I love you, Terry. Baby. I know. I love you too. There are a few things I must tell you about this case before walking in there. I thought you'd filled me in pretty thoroughly this afternoon on the phone. Well, there are some points that I purposely withheld until now. Such as? Well, frankly, I think Victoria's problems stem from the fact that she refuses to confront or adjust to her father's death. There's nothing very unusual about that. It's almost always a traumatic experience that will give rise to problems like this. Weren't you the doctor on the case of Beatrice Fuller, where she committed suicide? She did that to herself almost a year after I worked with her. Oh. Well, you see, Victoria thinks I killed her father, and she's deathly afraid of me. He left me a little money in his will, and she thinks that's the motivation. It's ridiculous. How well did you know her father? Oh, very well. He was one of my oldest and dearest friends. I'd known Vicky since she was a child. But this aggravation of anger toward me is not going to make things easy in there. Well, I'll see what I can do, Dr. Carlton. Once she's under, I can release her from her fears perhaps and put the whole thing right. Well, I hope so, for her sake. [DOORBELL RINGS] Ah, Dr. Carlton, welcome. This is Dr. Harcourt, the hypnotist I was telling you about. Well, how do you do? Fine. Thank you. Well, shall we come into the living room? Thank you. Vicky's just upstairs. She'll be down in a moment. Yes, this old place. I think it dates back to, oh, maybe early 1900s. In fact, they have a billiard table upstairs. That's true, yeah. Let's see. Can I get either of you a drink? Not for me. Julia? I'm fine, thanks. Uh, Vic, Dr. Cartlon's here. Uh, will you both excuse me for a moment? Certainly. Honey, they're here. I'm almost ready. How do I look? Well, well, well. You know, for somebody who hasn't got much sleep lately, you look radiant. Thanks. Yeah. Why don't you go on down, babe? They're ready for you. I better get some pillows for this thing, huh? OK. [ENGINE REVVING] What I want to do, Victoria, is to relax you, relax you to the farthest state that you can go. I want your mind free from all thought, from worries, from fear. Do you think that you can do that for me? I can try. Then what? Then sleep, very peaceful sleep, a sleep without dreams, without nightmares. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Oh, yes, very much, very much. Then let's try it. Feel the sleep in your fingertips. Close your eyes and feel the sleep move upwards through your arms to your head. You're asleep. You are asleep now. That's it. She's out. That's amazing. She's out like a light. What'd I tell you? Well, it was very much made easy by the fact that she's extremely fatigued. So what do we do now, just put her to bed? Well, Dr. Harcourt has an idea I think we should investigate. Well, what kind of idea? There's something in Victoria's mind which is causing these dreams, something that no one has been able to unlock. By questioning her now, while she's under, we might find the hidden demons and dredge them up and expose them for what they are and thereby free Victoria from their grasp. Is it dangerous? It's completely safe. In fact, it's therapeutic. And do you think it would help? Well, it can't hurt, Terry. OK. Go ahead. Victoria, can you hear me? It's Julia Harcourt. Yes, I hear you. How do you feel? Wonderful. I would like to ask you some questions if that's all right. I don't mind. Victoria, I'm looking for someone who's in trouble. Do you know of anyone who's in trouble? There's a young girl near me. She's crying. She's bloody and afraid. What's she talking about? She might be talking about herself in another lifetime. May I talk with this young girl? Maybe I can help her. I didn't mean to do it. But I couldn't help it. He made me. Don't you see? He forced me to do it. This is outrageous. Please be quiet. What did he make you do, Victoria? He forced me to make love to him and on my wedding night. It was a terrible, horrible thing to do. Who did this, Victoria? Your husband? No. It was his brother. He took me. I couldn't stop him. And Charles found out. I pleaded with him for mercy, but he had none for me. What did Charles do when he found out? Did he harm you? Did he kill you? He-- he buried me alive! [SCREAMING] My god. Baby. It's all right. It's all right. I thought you said this wasn't going to harm her. It hasn't. In fact, I'd say, Terry, that she's finally free. You see, by-- by touching this, by exposing this traumatic experience in her past life a few centuries ago, I think she'll have no more trouble with it. What are you telling me, that she's cured now? Of heard dreams about being buried alive, I'd say so. Regarding her feelings for Dr. Carlton and her father, I'm not sure. We'd best take her up to bed now. Don't you think? Terry, I was thinking. What? Maybe we should take a trip or something, a short one, just you and me. You know, get away for a while together. Sounds great, hon. But I'm afraid we just can't afford it right now. I know. It seems like such a dream, a dream in which I could be free and happy with you. You know what? We're going to take that trip. In fact, I'm going to start planning on it. Dr. Carlton said that you're going to sleep like a baby tonight. And when you wake up in the morning, everything's going to look different. Promise? I promise. [KNOCKING] TERRY: Vicky? Victoria, wake up, honey. [KNOCKING] Come on. Time to open your eyes. LISA: Wake up, bitch. [SCREAMING] Terry. Terry, help me please. I'm afraid that's just not possible, honey. VICKY: Terry, please. I can't breathe in here. I'm suffocating. No, no, no. I-- I put these boards with plenty of space between them. See? Plenty of space. You'll be fine until-- well, until-- God, Terry, why are you doing this? Shut up, cunt. You want to know why? Because you're a miserable, stupid cunt. That's why. Who's that? I'm embarrassed to admit it, Vic, but this is Lisa. You remember my secretary? Actually, this was all her idea. It's very easy to figure out, sweetheart. Hubby gets bored of fucking his basket case wife. Hubby tries fucking his girl Friday. Hubby loves it and loves it and loves it. Please, Terry, no. Damn it, Lisa. Can you show some compassion, huh? Can't you see she's scared to death? Are you scared to death, Vicky? Maybe not. But you will be soon. You see, your husband's run up some serious debts. And he needs some serious cash. With you dead, we can mortgage your house and live happily ever after, just like in the storybooks. Vicky, I just kept hoping that your heart would give out, just like your old man's. But I gotta hand it to you. You have a lot more strength than I gave you credit for. In god's name, Terry, don't do this! Now for the good part, you sniveling little whore. We're going to make your dreams come true. We're going to take you in the backyard and bury you alive. [SCREAMING] I think she's passed out. Good. At least now maybe the neighbors won't hear her scream. What do you say we get her downstairs, huh? Boy, she's still out. Well, when she wakes up and smells this dirt, she's going to think we really buried her. Mm-hmm. Then her fucking heart will burst like a ripe melon. And then we'll just have to take the body upstairs, put her to bed, call old Doc Carlton in the morning. So how does it feel to be a murderer? I don't know. I don't like it much. We do what we have to do. She didn't give us any choice. Well, it makes me feel alive. This is the greatest rush I've ever had. And now I'm going to fuck you in her bed. [GROANING] Oh, god. [SCREAMING] [LAUGHING] Terry. Yes. Yes. [THUMPING] [GIGGLING] [GRUNTING] [LAUGHING] [CLATTERING] Terry. Terry, wake up. Wake up. -What? Oh, not again. I'm tired, Lisa. Something happened downstairs in the kitchen. The kitchen? What? The window's open, and the silverware is scattered all over the floor. That's weird. Did you hear any noise from the basement? No. What do you think? I don't know. Well, check it out. I'm gonna check it out. Give me my pants. -Get up. Don't push me, Lisa. I'm a little sore. You know? Oh, god. Do you have a gun or something? A gun? No. Vicky was scared to have those things around. Shit. OK. So the first thing we're gonna do is check the cellar, make sure everything's OK. I should be getting my ass out of here right now. No, no. We're both in this together right up to our necks. [DIALING PHONE] Mr. Visconti, I think things might be starting to take shape. Explain yourself, Mr. Trent. It's pretty late, you know. I just saw Munroe come out of his house with some little gal who's not his wife. Do you know who she is? Yeah, it's the secretary, the one I met the other morning. Oh, Jesus. She's not dead. She's alive. She got away. What are we going to do? She could have the police on us in no time. We gotta clear out of here. We gotta clear out of here. I mean, she could be at the neighbor's right now. -Clear out? -Yeah. Yeah, we're going to go upstairs. We're going to get my clothes and any money I got stashed. And we're gonna go. Where are we gonna go, Mexico? That's fine. It's a good start. So what in your mind does it lead you to believe? LT. TRENT (ON PHONE): I think our suspicions might be correct. He's definitely cheating on his wife. He's probably getting ready to jump ship for that pretty little squeeze in the main office. MR. VISCONTI (ON PHONE): You've got him under observation. You won't let the little bastard get too far. But there's one thing that bothers me. MR. VISCONTI (ON PHONE): What's that? Munroe's wife. I don't think she left the house all night. It just doesn't jive. Look, you just stay on top of that welshing little son of a bitch. Let his wife be somebody else's problems, huh? Naturally. That son of a bitch is with her. You. You. This was your fucking idea. If I had waited, she probably would have died all by herself. Was Visconti gonna wait? [LAUGHTER] That's her. She's in the house. Jesus. It sounds like she's gone mad. [LAUGHTER] Don't you get it? It's perfect. Will you stop rattling and get dressed? She's crazy, Terry. Insane. All we have to do now is kill her. She went nuts, attacked you, and you killed her in self defense. Me? Why does it always have to be me? We can't let them know that I was here. They'll suspect something. This way, they'll buy your story. All we have to do is throw the coffin in the fireplace later. Oh, no, no. I don't think I can do that. You can. I'll help you as long as I'm out of here by the time you call the cops. [LAUGHTER] I want a big knife. Kitchen. Where's the silverware? It's all gone. [LAUGHTER] Vicky? All right now, come on out, honey. [LAUGHTER] Vi-- Vicky? You're real now, honey. You're-- you're sick. And you need a doctor. Your mind is playing tricks on you, honey. Nothing is what you think it is. I-- I want you to come out, and I can get you help. VICKY (VOICEOVER): Terry, please help me. My leg. It's broken. Please. I can't move. Where are you, honey? VICKY (VOICEOVER): Find me, please. Hurry. Where are you? You better go. She's lost it. What about you? I've got to stay out of sight. We can't risk her seeing me now. I don't know. Do it. Go, Terry. Go. Stop. Vic? Honey, I've been so worried about you. I figured it out, honey. It was those pills, you know. You were right about Doc Carlton. I mean, he was trying to kill you. So now you just tell me where you are because I'm gonna take care of you now. VICKY (VOICEOVER): Over here, Terry. Please. My leg. It hurts so much. Please, Terry. Help me. Over here. Wait for me, honey. Everything's gonna be fine now. I promise. [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [GIGGLING] Lisa! [SCREAMING] LISA: No! No! OPERATOR (ON PHONE): Metro Police Department. How may I help you? Yeah, you better send a car to, uh, 1659 Hopko Street. There's been a double murder. There's a couple bodies here. The suspect's still in the house. OPERATOR (ON PHONE): Can you give us a description of the suspect, please? It's a young woman. She's very bloody, and she's got a knife. OPERATOR (ON PHONE): We'll do our best. Are you calling from inside the house? Yeah. OPERATOR (ON PHONE): Perhaps you'd like to wait outside for the officers. It might be dangerous. Victoria! Victoria, can you hear me? Listen to me. Victoria, your old man was a scumbag. He owed my boss a lot of money. He couldn't get any money with you around. He's trying to drive you crazy. You hear me? Victoria? Victoria? [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] Damn. [SCREAMING] [POLICE SIRENS] OFFICER 1: OK, let's go. Which house is it? OFFICER 2: It's this one right here. Grab the rifle. OFFICER 1: I'm going to call for backup. OFFICER 2: Great. Put your guns away. She's in here. OFFICER 1: Yeah, you go around that way. OFFICER 2: Come on. This way. The suspect's in the kitchen.
