Hello? Oh, my God. Mom? Why are you crying? I just got the news... ...that your grandmother is ill. Is Grandma Dewi okay? I don't know, sweetheart. But we have to go to her house. We have to start packing. Excuse me. / Of course. Hello, honey. / Hello? I'm so sorry. I'm stuck in here. All flights are cancelled. The volcanic cloud is still thick. I understand. The clean air here is good for Sasha's heart anyway. I'm just going to inform her school about this later. Okay. I miss you, Nin. / Okay, take care. So, where were we? / My diagnose... ...is the hypertension and trauma were causing her mini stroke. Thank you, Doctor. If you don't have question anymore, we should go back to the hospital. Excuse me./ Thank you, Doctor. Fen, do you see that? That woman has been staring at our house since morning. She's Bi Ana. She used to work here once. During the time of your trouble. I caught her standing in front of the gate several times... ...but she didn't say anything. When I approached her to greet her and ask her to come in... ...she just turned and left. That's strange. What is it, Mom? I think she's trying to tell us something. Say sorry Yes, Mom. Please forgive me, Mom. I caused you a lot of trouble. And maybe saying "I'm sorry" is not enough. I've been wondering why did you distance yourself from Mom. For three years. You didn't even call to say hi or visit her even once. Someday, you'll understand. When Mom's condition is getting better and she can talk normally... ...we'll tell you everything. Arman never begged you to reconcile with Mom? He did dozens of times. Especially when Sasha was born. But I stood my ground, and he stopped bringing up the subject. You're married now and your daughter has grown up. When will you start visiting Mom again? You're just cruel. Fen. It's not about being cruel or not. I even thought she'd never forgive me. But I think she did, after she saw me today. Even though she expressed it in a strange way by writing "say sorry". That means she wanted me to apologize. And me staying here is just because she's ill. And I want to make things right between us. Does the nursery that's already furnished and decorated... ...adding to the damage of your relationship with Mom? Time to eat. It will help you get better quick. - Aunt Fen. - Yes, dear? Mom said there are lots of toys in warehouse. I didn't know that. Why don't you go find out? Okay. Mommy! Sasha? Sasha? Sasha! Sasha! Sasha! Sasha! It's? stuck. The door is stuck. Sasha? Sasha! Oh, my God! Help me carry her. Careful. Be careful. Good morning. Good morning, Doctor. Our colleagues in Jakarta just informed us... ...they've found a heart donor for your daughter. Thank God. Thank you, Doctor. Now, excuse me. Thank you. Doc, is it okay if you see the patient's parents alone? I need to do the paperwork. Okay, I'll see them now. / Okay. - Mr. Arga and Mrs. Intan. - Yes. Well, Doctor? We've informed Bhayangkara Hospital about healthy organs that can be donated. They have a child patient who needs a heart transplant. All right. Now, excuse me. Be strong, honey. We have to let Tiara go. At least our daughter is helping another child to survive. Peace be upon you. / Peace be upon you too. My condolences. / Thank you. I'm sorry for your loss. Thank you. Let's go. We should leave. / All right. Sir. / Thank you. Let's go to your room. Mommy... Sasha... Are you still afraid of what happened to you that day? Don't worry, everything's fine now. And now you're healthy. Your room has been cleaned and your daddy's here. There's nothing to be worried about. But why he can't stay longer? Why does he have to go back to work? I still miss him. Let's go to bed. You should rest. Try to get some sleep. Get some sleep. - Do you want chicken? - Yes. - Orange juice? - Yes. What's wrong with you? It's not funny. Sasha. Sis. Once upon a time, there was a girl named Snow White. Snow White lived with the Queen, her evil stepmother. The Queen was jealous of her beauty and she ordered her guards to kill her. However, they didn't have the heart, and just told her to leave the kingdom. You have to sleep. I'm going to go check on Grandma Dewi. If you need anything, you can call me anytime. If you need anything, you can call me anytime too. - Deal? - Deal. Now, sleep. Sis. I'm sorry about last night. But I'm still confused. What's happening to you and Sasha? It's weird, you know? The drink you drank was not orange juice. It was blood. And you didn't eat noodles. It was hair. What are you talking about? If you could see it, you would believe me. I'm scared. Don't be ridiculous. Maybe it's time to tell you the truth. I don't want you to get the wrong idea about me. I have my reasons why I left the house and Mom. I was disappointed in Mom. Because she never tells me the truth about my stillborn baby. Nina, have you eaten? Mom... ...you still haven't told me where you buried my baby. Listen to me, sweetheart. You have Sasha now. She's cute and smart. Your husband is so sweet and he loves you so much. Unlike your ex-boyfriend Rico who got you pregnant and just left. I want you to forget your past. And your baby left us a long time ago anyway. Even without Rico in our lives, the baby was still mine. Sasha's sibling. Mom. And I was also sad... ...to see the nursery I prepared for the baby. I'd fall to pieces if I ever see the room again. I don't care about your past. What's important is now we are happy. Now you have a loving family. What's done is done. Don't dwell on the past. Now go to sleep, okay? Not before you read me a story. Which one? / Snow White. You haven't finished the story. I forgot. Where were we? Snow White entered the dwarfs' hut. How did you know that? I haven't read that part... Somebody read it for me. Really? Who? Aunt Fenny? Daddy? Grandma Dewi? Grandma Dewi? She's evil and useless. Sasha! That's a mean thing to say about your grandma. Now, tell me who read you that part? I guess it was Bi Yoyo, then. Bi Yoyo is too dumb. She can't read. She's illiterate. Sasha! All right, if you think you know the rest of the story, tell me. Why did the Queen punish Snow White? She deserved the punishment from the wicked Queen. Because she broke into the dwarfs' house and ate their food. Is it true that all wrong doers must be punished? And didn't Snow White already apologize to the dwarfs for that? Sorry is not enough. What's wrong, Mom? Did I scare you? Give me a hug. My friend told me that. Your friend? Is your friend here? Mommy... Stop playing and eat your breakfast. When can I go back to school? I'm bored staying at home. You can't go back to school yet. You have to stay at home for at least two more weeks. Okay. Fen... I think Sasha has an imaginary friend. I often saw her talking to someone when there was nobody around her. The strangest thing was when I was going to read her Snow White... ...and she said she already knows the rest of the story. She said her friend in this house read her the story. Well... I think that's not unusual. Having an imaginary friend is not unusual for kids. Please don't hurt Grandma Dewi. I have played with the doll like you told me. Sasha! What were you doing on the ledge? You could fall! Come here. Sorry, Mom. Now tell me, why did you enter your grandma's room... ...and climb the railing to the ledge? My friend told me to do that. She said she will hurt Grandma if I don't stand on the ledge. Which friend? You don't have any friends here. But I'm not lying, Mom. Are you sure you're not lying? / I promise. I had to do what my friend told me or... ...she will hurt Grandma Dewi. She told me that. From now on, don't ever mention your friend again. Understand? And the only people you should obey are just Daddy and Mommy. What's going on here? Go to your room. Don't be too hard on Sasha. She's been acting strange lately. Sasha? Sasha? Sasha? / I think she's outside. Mrs. Dewi! Mom? Help me carry her back to bed. Be careful. See, my friend hurt Grandma Dewi. Go to your room. Hello, honey? Please call me back immediately. Sasha is behaving strangely after her surgery. And there are a lot of weird things happening in Mom's house. Come home as soon as you can. What happened? That's Tiara's stuffed toy. Sha? Sasha? Sha? Where were you? I was downstairs. Playing with the doll. Excuse me. I'm Sasha's aunt. The girl who got your daughter's heart. I know. I remember you. Please come in. Sit down. I don't know where to start. But I need to tell you something. Tell me, it's okay. It's about Tiara. Her spirit has been haunting my niece and my family. Excuse me? Forgive me. I didn't mean to sound ungrateful for your daughter's heart. But Tiara's spirit has been haunting Sasha. That's impossible. She's already peaceful in heaven. This stuffed toy could belong to any kid. And we left Tiara's on her grave. I put it there myself on her burial day. Who's with you in that picture? Tiara. Wait, Sasha. What happened to your back? Do you remember? I was pushed, Mom. Your friend pushed you? Hush, don't cry. I'm sorry. I yelled at you a lot. I'm just worried about you. Come here. Don't go anywhere. I need to tell you something. Aren't you tired of eating cereals? You ate it for breakfast and yesterday's dinner. Eat the healthy fruit first. Take the banana. Please don't hurt Grandma Dewi. I have played with the doll, just like you told me to do. Who are you talking to, Sasha? Cereals. Now eat. Sha? Sha! Sha! Sasha! Sasha! Sasha! Ma'am. How is she, Doctor? Your daughter is stable now. She's in recovery, especially from her trauma. We have removed the water from her lungs. You should let Sasha rest. Thank God. That's good news. But I'm not Sasha's mother. She's my sister's daughter. Sis, the doctor's here. Rico. Nina. "Are you sure it's mine?" Our baby? What kind of woman do you think I am? Nina... I'm not your guardian angel who could follow you around. How could I know if you... Nina. I'll wait downstairs. / Okay. So Sasha is not my daughter? I mean, our daughter? No. She's my daughter with my husband. And our baby was stillborn. Forgive me. I'm no longer angry at you. And to me, our relationship is the biggest mistake of my life. And I pray to God everyday to never cross path with you again. And I hope this is the last time we ever do. Excuse me. Nurse. / Yes? Where's Sasha, the patient? She has been discharged. Okay. Pardon me, Miss. I think the nursery that's now being used as warehouse... ...should be cleaned and repainted. We should also remove the junk. I guess my mother already told you about that room. That room is the reason why I never returned to this house. She never told me anything. But I often hear creepy noises from that room at night. Listen, don't ever mention that to anybody, especially to Sasha. She would definitely beg to go home, and who's going to take care of my mother? But I'm not kidding, Miss. I swear to God. Since you and Sasha got here, weird stuff happens frequently. What are you talking about? Stop talking nonsense. Nurse? Nurse? Nurse? Sis. I went to meet Tiara's mother, Sasha's heart donor. Also, Bi Yoyo told me she saw a little girl ghost with long straight hair. And Tiara's hair was wavy. I had a conversation with Bi Yoyo the other day. She said after Sasha and I return to this house... ...strange stuff starts to happen. What's the connection between us returning to this house... ...and the ghost of the little girl? Mom? Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom. Please wake up, Mom. Mom... Please wake up, Mom. Mom! Mom. Mom! Excuse me. I think we need to talk later. I have to leave. Sis, why don't you go downstairs? This is the last day of Mom's mourning period. I don't feel well. Would you cover for me? Nina. Honey. Birth Certificate It is so hard for me to say this... ...but your baby is stillborn. It was a breech birth, and the baby was pinned. So the doctor couldn't save my grandchild. Kusuma Hati Orphanage Adoption Letter Baby Birth Details Mommy... So what do you know? Since your return, my guilt keeps torturing me. You have to know the truth. Mrs. Dewi asked me to bring your baby to an orphanage in Sukabumi... ...run by my sister-in-law. Because she was ashamed of having a grandchild born out of wedlock. As the chairman of Kusuma Hati Orphanage, which took in the baby from Mrs. Dewi... ...please forgive me for not knowing the real story about the baby. I understand. It's not your fault. Since the start, she seldom played with her peers. She only had one best friend. Her stuffed toy. She carried it with her everywhere. I love you, Bunny Doll. Are you tired? Let's go, then. Your daughter tried to leave this house multiple times. She ran away. She ran away? Yes. And everytime I asked her why, she always said... ...that she wants to find her mother. It was always the same answer. That would lead to her tragic fate. Bi Ana told me that my daughter got hit by a car and died. Several days before her death... Where do you think you're going? / There. No, you're not. Your daughter lost her favorite stuffed toy. She said the other girls stole it from her. Then she sneaked out from the house to search for it. And that day... ...on the street... ...a truck hit her. I had a dream... I had a dream... In that dream, I was running after a girl. But that girl was hit by a car. Maybe it was some kind of premonition about her death. Maybe she wanted to say goodbye by giving me the dream. You don't understand how I feel. The death of my baby has been haunting me for years. And I always blamed myself, but in reality, my mother lied to me. What's done is done. Hello? We're in the middle of a discussion. Call back later. Sis... Where's Sasha? She was there one minute ago. Sasha? Sha. Sasha? Sha. Sha. Sasha. Sha. Sha. Sasha. Sasha! Sasha! Sasha! Oh, my goodness. It's okay, honey. Here's some fruits, Mom. I love you, Mommy. I love you too. Sha, let's go get your daddy.
