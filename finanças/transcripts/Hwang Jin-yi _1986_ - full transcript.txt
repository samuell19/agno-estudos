Hwang Jin-ie Jang Mi-hee Ahn Seong-ki Shin Il-Ryong Jun Moo-song Screenplay: Choi In-ho Director of Photography: Jung Il-sung Music: Lee Seong-jae Editing: Kim Hyun Production: Lee Woo-seok Director: Bae Chang-ho Hey. It's late, go to sleep. We might get a message from Jin Do-ryeong's house in a few days. In the meantime make sure you take care of yourself. Ok. Who's there? Hey Duk-bo! Are you there Duk-bo? The shoe thief came again. He leaves everything else and only takes Jin-ie's shoes. Ah! Duk-bo! Duk-bo! What are you doing over there? The shoe thief came again. This time he took the shoes that Jin-ie was going to wear at her wedding. Make sure to use the best leather and be extra careful when making them. Let us celebrate the year of the pig. - Hey. - Yes. Let us show devotion to the lord who gazes down. May all your wishes come true. You aren't where you're supposed to be and you didn't sleep where you were supposed to. Let us show devotion to the lord who gazes down. There was originally no place for the body. I hope you can find a place for your heart. What are you doing? You should be getting ready to go to the temple. I'm not going. What! This time you have to get married. Just because I pray to Buddha doesn't mean I'm going to get married does it? I don't want to get married yet. That isn't something a young lady should say! Go and get ready to go out. Save us, merciful Buddha. Save us, merciful Buddha. What is he doing here! Catch him! He went over there! Catch him! Over there! What a commotion. Who is this man? We caught him trying to climb over the wall. Lift his head up! Oh my. Oh my. That's Baek-jeong. He's hiding something under his shirt! Oh! Just breaking into a nobleman's house is enough to face execution! But you have impure motives! Someone like you should have your limbs torn apart! Take him to the authorities! Just a minute. Stop there. Mother. I am solely to blame for this incident. If this embarrassing incident gets out it will only bring trouble to our family. There's no need to go to the authorities and stir up trouble, is there? I will give him a whipping to make sure this never happens again. This is unbelievable. Are the preparations going well? Yes don't worry. I can't believe this. The wedding is tomorrow and it's pouring. It's ok. Before Jin-ie gets married the rain has to come and wash away any bad luck. What's with The depressing funeral chants? Don't you know if you see a funeral the day before a celebration, it's good luck? Who's funeral is it? It's the shoemaker who lives on that hill over there. Nobody knows what the reason is but he set himself on fire and killed himself. Oh my! What kind of horrific event is that? It's probably the shoemaker's funeral. Oh dear. That's so sad. Push it back. Try pushing it back. Is it moving? Giddy on up! Giddy on up! What can I get for you? - The King doesn't know. - I'll have a bottle of rice wine. - The voice of the people is the voice of God. - Appetizers? Kimchi. Just let it go. What can we do about it? God will take care of it. It makes me so sad I want to die. I'd be willing to give my wife to... That's enough. Let's get us some girls. Stop it. Stop telling me to stop! I can't believe it. I don't understand. Is everything going well? I'm in shock. I can't believe it. A hundred nyang will buy a large tile-roofed house but she said no to this. I can't believe it. Does Myeong-wol think she's the only gisaeng in Songdo? I can't believe her. One 100 nyang is nothing. She'll turn down 10,000 nyang if she doesn't like you. Then what is the point of being a gisaeng? Are you talking about one of the top three gisaeng's in Songdo? If you go to her looking like this... You're sure to get kicked out. Are you saying that Myeong-wol is a virgin? A virgin gisaeng... That's the first time I've ever heard of that. She may be a gisaeng now but she was also the daughter of a very wealthy family. That's right. She chose to become a gisaeng because she fell for the wrong guy. - Miss! - Yes. Oh my. Your visit to Songdo is completely unexpected. Are you by chance here because the King or one of his inspectors issued private orders? You've gained quite a bit of weight. That must mean you've been dealing with a number of issues. I'm just frustrated with life. I thought I would stop by Songdo And get some fresh air. There's a lot to see in Songdo. I'm seeing a lot here already. The women here are beautiful. Let me show you something truly beautiful. There is a beautiful gisaeng here by the name of Myeong-wol. I wanted to introduce her to you so I've already sent word asking for her to be brought over. It seems she is quite the arrogant girl. She didn't even show up to the banquet honoring my appointment to this new position. In truth I haven't even had the pleasure of holding her hand yet. Her beauty is worth every penny. I'm sure she'll come out today. Do I have something on my face? You've been rejected too. This is a message saying that Myeong-wol isn't feeling well and can't come out. What an impudent girl! Let's go. So did you have a good time today? When will you be coming back? I'll be back in a few days. That's what they say but they never come back. Have a safe journey. Let's go inside. Should I put dinner on the table? I'm not hungry. The full moon is as big as an empty mountain And the flowing clear stream wonders if it can come to rest. The stream wants to come to rest, can't fill the full moon. Only the ocean that stays can fill the full moon. Shut the door. Who's there? I've brought a message asking Myeong-wol to take part In Vice Minister Kim's birthday celebration. She's not feeling well. She's not taking part in any activities. What's that all about. Does she think she's the only gisaeng in Songdo? Would you like to have a drink? Then would you like some fruit salad? Excuse me. I'm not hungry. You've been here too long haven't you? It seems that way... Just because I'm leaving you think it's forever? Before winter ends, I promise I'll be back. Here. Excuse me. Please give this to Byuk Gae-soo. Oh. This is his handwriting. Who are you and where are you from? Tell him it's someone from Songdo. He's not here right now. He left as part of a Chinese envoy. But If you came from Songdo, Didn't you see him there? He was at an inn in Songdo for awhile But it's already been two months since he's left for China. We just got a message that he arrived safely. Have a safe trip. Welcome. Bring some kebabs to this table. Hello and welcome. Please enjoy your meal. Please come again. Hello and welcome. Do you have a room available for the evening? Of course! Please come in. Come. Please come here. Please come here. Hey clean that room. - Miss! Hurry and bring us our appetizers. - Coming right away. Yes, it's coming out. Hurry up and bring the alcohol over here. Bring some alcohol here. Sir, would you like me to call a young lady for you? No thank you. There's nothing like a working girl to help get rid of any discomfort you may have. We have a girl here who not only sings well but is very beautiful. Please close the door. Ok I'll get her ready for you. Hey Sam-weol! Get a table ready for this room. My name is Jin-ie. Thank you. You're here early today. Bring them some pine needle wine. I don't want this cheap pine needle wine. Hey lady! Where's Jin-ie? Oh she's with another customer. What? Listen lady, do I have to slap some sense into you? Bring her here! Hurry up and bring her to me! Now! Ok ok. My apologies. Lady! Go ahead. I'm sorry. I'll be back in a minute with your food and alcohol. This is the first time I've ever liked a girl like you. Your looks have been enough so far. Isn't it time you gave me your heart? If you do as I say, I'll make you a concubine. I can change your destiny. Why you! You! Why you! Excuse me. You look like you're from a well to do family but you seem to have had a lot to drink. What! So is this your pimp? You're being a bit excessive. Who do you think you are! Well, you're not... Wearing a gat doesn't make you a nobleman. You look much better without it. Listen! If you don't do as I say tomorrow I'll shut this whole place down! Got it? Yes yes. I'll be sure to remember. Your looks will only get you so far! Hey grab the money! Please get home safely. Please take the table away. He thinks he can get away with anything because of who is father is. How long will I have to put up with it. - I know. - Oh dear. This sucks. Oh my. Listen Jin-ie, you're going to have to come up with something by tomorrow. Bring us more alcohol! Ok. When do you think the water will recede? Who knows. It will probably take about five days. Hey! What do you think? I suspect so. You're going to have to take a different route. Come on. Let's go back. Let's go. Are you saying that the boat has been cancelled? It's not going anywhere. The monsoon rains have made the river dangerous. Then how am I supposed to get to the Kangkyung marketplace. - Kangkyung... - Yes. If you want to get to Kangkyung you need to go all the way back to Yesan and go through the mountains. What a shame. The boat isn't going anywhere, go back! Turn back! The boat has been cancelled! - It's not leaving? - No it's not. Excuse me. Yes... It's my fault you were humiliated last night. No. Rather it's my fault you have to leave. But where are you going? I thought I would see the world And wander to Wherever my feet take me... I'm glad to hear it. It looks like I'll have some company for the time being. Go ahead. How far are you going? I'm going to the market. Why are you going there? I'm going to do some business there. - Go ahead. - Ok Go ahead. Go ahead. Hey you! Where are you headed? I'm.. I'm going to Kangkyung market. Are you two married? Yes. Go ahead. Thank you. Where are you headed? To Kangkyung. Thank you. You don't look well. Since when... Why aren't you going to Songdo? Indeed, I may be a teacher who spent all my time reading books But don't you think I've heard of the famous Hwang Jin-ie from Songdo? Here, lie down. When you get to Kangkyung what will happen... I'm just Going to meet my wife and children. It's already been a year since I've seen them. They say you can't predict the future but Who would have thought that someone like me, Who spent his life studying and reading books, would get Caught up in a revolution and have to go into hiding. In some ways it's a good thing. Education and government posts are disappearing so there's nothing left. Now... When I find my family I'm going to hide in a secluded village in the mountains, Plow fields, build a farm and Live a quiet life. That's my final wish. Chickens. Chickens for sale. Rice cakes for sale. Take this money... Use it for your travels. I've enjoyed myself. Are you going to Songdo? I'm going to Hanyang. One of the government ministers has secretly sent someone for me so I expect to hear good news soon. But they say my wife isn't well. I'll send someone to see her when I get to Hanyang. Please take care of yourself. They're gone. My wife is gone. She was sold into slavery. So were my children. You're suffering needlessly Because of me. You've already been with me too long. Where are you going? Is there anybody here? Is the landlord here? Who's there? I'm looking for some work. I don't have any skills But I can sing And I know how to dance. I'm not asking for much Just a place for two people to sleep and some food. This place has been closed for business for some time. This year's harvest has been bad so nobody is drinking. Then is it possible to give us anything just to curb our hunger... I could give you some hot soup and rice. Thank you. I'm a widower. It's been a few months since I've been with a woman. I could also help out with travel expenses but it depends on you. Isn't that what generosity is all about? Why don't you come on in? I've already had some. If you're not wearing a hat you'll draw more suspicion. Your face and hands are not those Of a commoner. Money... Where did you get it? Where did you get the money? Get out of here! We're barely surviving this year. You're going to give someone your sickness wandering around begging like that! Get away. You! You dirty girl! You should go your own way. Go. Go! What are you doing! My shoe... it fell off. Why can't you hurry up! How much food is left? Well. There is about three or four days worth. - We need to eat less! - Ok. That's barely enough to sustain us. Shut up! We have to wait until Cham-bong's 60th birthday party in Yesan. If we can hold out until then, things will get better. You got it? - Yes. We got it. - Be quiet. Excuse me. Would it be possible to stay for the night? Hurry and spoon out the rice. Hurry. Go and sleep up there. Oh, ok. Where are we? Shut the door! Oh, of course. What song should we sing at the birthday party? - Sing the song of a prostitute. - Be quiet. Since when have we traveling actors ever made money singing? I don't care what the song sounds like. When we get to Yesan... What are you looking at! I told you to go upstairs. Ok. Oh dear. Hey girls. If you want to earn your keep when we get to Yesan, say yes no matter what, even if he's deformed! Got it? Even if he's paralyzed? Shut up! Keep your wits about you unless you want to starve to death! Hey Choon-shim! Will you be able to work? Don't be ridiculous. Look! Her stomach is too huge to be with any man! What a time to be pregnant! I'm sorry but... Could you spare something to eat... Look! We barely have anything to eat. Excuse me... By any chance Do you need a girl who can sing? The girl I came with Knows how to sing and dance. - That girl is attractive... - I know. Sir. Don't we need more girls anyway? What about you? I don't have any useful skills. I just need some money to cover travel expenses. Just a bit? No way! The girl looks weak! Do you think she can keep up with us in her condition? No way! Go.
