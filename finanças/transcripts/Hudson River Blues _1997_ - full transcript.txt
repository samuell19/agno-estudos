(serene music) - Oh God, get me through this weekend, and I'll give, a day's pay to the poor orphans. (pleasant music) (telephone buzzing) - [Man] Jeffrey Spencer. - Sweety. - Hi. - [Woman] I have great news. They're flying me in on Thursday for the interview, first class. - [Jeffrey] A power commuter, huh? - [Woman] Yes, we are going to take Manhattan. - [Jeffrey] We are gonna take over the world! (woman chuckling) So we're gonna have a three-day weekend! - Yeah. - Do you have the stamina? - [Woman] You'll see (chuckles). So do you think marriage will put a dent in our sex life? - [Jeffrey] I sure hope so, (woman chuckles) then maybe I can get some work done, which is what I have to do now. - [Woman] So hang up, it's your turn. - [Jeffrey] Nu-uh, it's your turn. - [Woman] All right, together. - [Both] One, two, - [Jeffrey] Two and a half... (woman chuckling) Two and three-quarters... - [Woman] (sighs) Oh Jeff I love you! (pleasant music) Christmas is too hectic, what about a Thanksgiving wedding? - [Jeffrey] Great! Wait, can't, I have to be in Hong Kong for a two-week shoot, you wanna come? - [Woman] Can't, I'm in a law school, remember? - [Jeffrey] How much longer? Soon you'll be here. - [Woman] I can't wait. (pleasant music) (car horn honking) (hectic music) (beeping) (beeping) - Did you remember to pack something nice for the party? - Oh yeah. Hey hey hey, what's this? No computer, no cell phone. - Oh well, no lucky shirt. - Yes lucky shirt! - Ah ah ah ah ah! Yes computer (laughs)! - No computer. This is our getaway weekend. Did you forget? - Oh... (lips smacking) No. Of course not. (groaning) (footsteps echoing) But you know how it is at my mothers. - [Jeffrey] Yeah, it's great. - For you maybe. (sighs) Maybe I'll be sucked up by the great family swamp. (squealing) (clattering) - [Jeffrey] You all right? - Yes. Can we store some of this stuff at Mom's? - Wow... - How much of it can we cram into the trunk? - Uh... (alarm beeping) - Oh shit! I'm gonna be late, um, do what you can. Oh, don't forget Grandpa's presents! - Oh what'd we get him? - A clock radio, a cordless razor and an electronic personal organizer. - Just what every octogenarian needs. (telephone beeping) - Hey Laura, Ben's in. - In where? - Your office. - Thanks Robin. Good morning Ben. - I wasted the whole night looking up precedents and the potential violations in that shareholder's agreement. Couldn't find a thing. No, now Clifton is gonna grill me on this! - That, - I'm sure! - is not the issue. - What? - It's about transfer restrictions. - No it can't be that easy. - Uh huh. (keyboard clacking) (computer beeping) There are no transfer restrictions in violation of the UCC. Read it yourself, it's clear, it's simple, it's the law. Isn't that comforting? (chattering) (bell ringing) - [Set Manager] Quiet on the set! - Okay okay, it's ready, let's go. - This is a rehearsal, and action! (coughing) - Sh! (beeping) - Cue the dog. - Action, dog! (dog barking) (dog sneezing) - (sighs) Christ almighty. - Cut! - Not another allergic dog. Can you believe this? Jerry? (bell ringing) What's wrong with this one? - Wrong? This stuff is poison. - That's the point, it's week killer, get it? - Yeah well it's making my dog sick. (snuffly barking) - Getting a little noisy around here. (sneezy barking) - [Woman] Where's lunch? - Send in the backup dog. - [Director] Call this set! - Look I got to get out of here. - Where you going? - Well Stan I'll tell 'ya, first it was flammable baby clothes, then it was carcinogenic face powders. - Jeff, they're clients, big accounts. - Now it's a lawn product that kills pets? - What do you want, a location shoot, Fiji, Paris? Some perfume commercial? You could take your wife. You could take the model! - Oh man! - Wha-wha-wha-what is it, do you want a raise, is that it? - No Stan I just want a product that doesn't kill people. (doors clattering) - [Laura] We're going to my mothers. - You're gonna jump-start the sex at your mother's? - Sh! (chuckling) - How long has it been? - Six weeks now, if it was any of your business! - I thought you hadn't been there in months! Oh, you mean six weeks without sex! God no wonder you're so tense. By the way, Clifton called a senior partners meeting, by tonight you could be partner. - That's why I'm so tense. (sighing) - [Man] Look who's here. - (chuckles) Pay up! Come on! - Jordan was off last night. - Yes he was, (mumbles), fools. - Sure you don't want to let it ride until next week? - Absolutely not, and you guys should never bet against the home team. - Good morning everyone. Take your seats please. Eric. Eric, what's happening with the Smithum matter? - I'm meeting with Smithum senior this afternoon to discuss the restructuring of their offshore entity. - Senior? Eric, I told you Smithum junior, not Smithum senior. - What junior? I, I, I... - Will you see me later please? (clapping) Now, we have a new client. Important, very important, but very demanding. Who's up? - Give it to Laura, Clifton, she's good with women. - You're assuming that demanding means it's a woman? Clifton I will take that case. - Robin, get the rest of Mr. Dhalberg's file, - Yes sir. - and give it to Laura. I'm sure she'll want to review it over the weekend. Now we have a meeting first thing Monday morning, prepare for an October 10th court date. - Don't we have something else on October 10th sir? - Well that may be, now you have this. - Okay. (unexpectedly perky music) - Fucking banner. - There was a young fellow name Arius, whose approaches to sex were quite various, he'd screw anything from princess to king, and the results were invariably hilarious.

People have a right to their fantasies. (telephone ringing) Julia Hartley. - Julia, darling. - [Julia] Yago, are you coming to Dad's party? - I wouldn't miss it for anything in the world. Now listen, you're Microsoft commission is for a statue at National, not Manhattan headquarters. - [Julia] That's even better, ask for double the money. - Why I thought I'd bring the big Microsoft honcho to the party, where I'll put the squeeze on then. - [Julia] You're a genius! - See you tomorrow, ciao. - Got me an incredible commission. - That's great, Mom, don't make my butt so big. - I love a big butt.

What's wrong with the song? - It's no good Diane. - All you do is criticize! You son-of-a-bitch, get out of my life! Oh this time it's really over! - Really over huh? What were the last 10 times, rehearsals? - You see, I can't take that sarcasm! - This is my thanks for getting you a booking. - Oh in Poughkeepsie for Christ sake, in a diner! - You know what, it's work! Anyway it wasn't a diner, they had table clothes. (water splashing) - Asshole! - If you'd quit pissing away your talent, and write serious songs, you could get any gig you wanted. - Ron, I'm sorry!

What's this one's name? - Mom, meet Bud. - How do you do Bud? - Hi! - Lesley! - Hello stranger! - [Laura] Oh it's good to see you. - [Diane] I hope you like him, he's a present for you. - Oh what do I do with him? - He's a plumber, Mom. (Bud chuckling) - Ah. I'll put the cot in Theodore's room. - Who is she kidding? - Actually this one's a hunk. - Don't touch it, 'cause otherwise the mother won't come back. - Okay. Where do you suppose he fell from, out of there? - Yeah. - God it's so beautiful here. - [Lesley] They sell laptops at Victoria's Secret? - Oh uh, Teddy's not gonna tell Jeff I'm opening a branch office in his room is he? - Teddy's good at keeping secrets. - Good.

(voicemail beeping) - Robin, did I make partner? Where are you, um, I want to know what happened at the meeting, call me a.s.a.p.. - [Lesley] I take it the heat is on. - Ugh, let's not talk about it. If you're having problems with Teddy why don't you just send him to us one weekend? - I got a better idea. How about you come up and take care of Teddy and Grandpa and I go there for the weekend? - It's a deal! (chuckling) You burnt? - You know I run this whole operation with Mom as artist in residence. (bell ringing) Oh, that's the meat loaf. (laughing) - What a bunch of mixed up kids. - [Teddy] Yeah. - Hey! - Hey what are you guys doing in my room? - Oh, I'm leaving, I'm leaving! (laughing) Goodbye! - [Laura] I'll be down in a minute Les. - [Lesley] Okay. - What's this? - Um, force of habit? - What's this? - Um, Jeff I'm sorry. Clifton dumped a new client on me at the last minute. What was I supposed to do? - You could have said no! - I'm, did, did I do something wrong? - No Teddy. - Yum, I'm starving. (chattering) - May I have my phone? I'm expecting a call from Robin. - Or Clifton, or Ben. - Thank you. - Okay gang, Mom wants to change the plates. - (sighs) Why? - We've already started. - I know, don't put back. - (laughs) Oh my god, this is so unnecessary. (clattering) - Why is every minute chaos in this house? Thank you. - Thank you honey. - Go to bed! - Humph, what? I have to take the meat loaf out. - It's all taken care of Drena. - Goodnight Drena! - Goodnight Drena! - [Drena] Goodnight everybody! - This is an event! It may be our last family dinner here. I've put the house on the market. - What? Without consulting us? - How could you Mom, this is our home? - I didn't think anybody would care! Jeff's the only one who's ever here. - Uh, what am I, chopped liver? - I slept with the Grand Duke of Dart, beef Wellington, beans, a prune tart. - What about Grandpa? - He goes with the house. - Mom! - His grumblings abdominal, - He's coming with me. - Were simply abominable, till finally he passed a big-- - Dad, please! (flatulating loudly) (laughing) I thought everybody would be happy, change is good! Otherwise you get in ruts. - I agree. But you haven't told us Julia, where are you planning to move? - Soho. - [All] Soho? - You'll be surrounded by artists, I think that's great! - No it's not that simple Jeff! Our lives will be uprooted! - Yeah but Julia should have the freedom to go where she wants, don't you think? - I don't believe you! You used to always take my side. - Look, Grandpa. I almost forgot. Happy birthday. - [Julia] I got him the same thing. - Bubble wrap. - Me too! - He's becoming one of them. (bubble wrap popping) - [Lesley] Mm, this pie is great. I really pigged out. (chuckling) Someone stop me. I shouldn't be doing this. - Lesley did you get a Miracle Bra? - No, a miracle baby. - A miracle baby what do you mean? - I'm pregnant Laura! - Oh my god! (laughing) Oh my, on purpose? - Uh well, uh, Teddy knows and Mom knows, that's it. - So who's the father? - Mm, it's a long story. - I got time! Lesley, get back in here! (laughing) - Okay, someone I know, very well, and Teddy is really happy and so am I, I've always wanted more kids. - When's the wedding? - Well, um... - He's married? - Let's just say the official story is artificial insemination. - Give me a break! - Nobody wants to believe it, that's their problem. - I must have been adopted. - I'll never forget, the night my husband left for good. Watching his tail lights disappear, like a shooting star on a summer night. I raised these kids with no support of any kind from their father. - Well that must have been tough ma'am. - He died mum. - But that was later. Heart attack. I ran this old house, single-handedly. - Maybe a hundred years ago. - [Julia] Squirrels in the chimney one day, broken pipes the next. - Well you got a great house here ma'am, you just, you need a handyman. (dishwasher banging) - No Ma, the dishwasher's broken. - I uh, can take a look at it. - Oh, great! You're hired. - Do you like ooze or is that too strong? - Well why, well uh, abuse? Abuse. - Abuse, misuse? Misuse! - I like ooze, it's an image, I think it's stronger. - [Diane] Okay I'll go with ooze. I think it's funny too. - What are you guys doing? - Oh we're just working on the song for the benefit. We're fine. - Okay. (thumping) - Okay I'm gonna write some more verses. - [Robin] I'm indisposed, you know what to do. - Robin, Laura, call me back! Fax me, email me, anything, please I'm dying here! (crickets chirping) - Martha! My little mouse! (cheerful piano music) - I found the song that grandpa used to sing to us. ♫ Put your arms around me honey, hold me tight ♫ Close me up inside your arms, all through the night ♫ Here, near, the one that I adore ♫ It's clear what the night is for ♫ Let the world go by and never slow its pace ♫ I've found all - You gonna tuck me in too? ♫ I need inside ♫ Your sweet embrace ♫ Oh, oh I never knew ♫ Anyone like you (pleasant music) - Laura?

Don't let me go! - Kath! - [Kath] It's dark out there alone. - Hey Jeff what are you doing up so late? - Huh? - Mind if I join you? I can't sleep. - Me neither. - [Darling] Really not since we met. - [Kath] Not since we met. - In life, and in death, say it Kath! - In life, and in death, we'll never be parted. - [Darling] You do believe that, don't you Kathy? (sniffing) (dramatic music) (sighing) - Life sucks, and then you die. - That's depressing. - I hate my job. - So quit. - Oh it's not that easy, I, I have a mortgage and, I want a simpler life. I can't stop thinking about Todd's job. - Aw, that'd be great for you. You'd get to be on the river all the time. Oh, shit. - Right you see the problem. I'd be up here. It's not the life Laura signed on for. (sniffing) - Well what does she say? - Oh god, I haven't told her. Not that Laura even knows I'm alive. Yeah, get this, I have to make an appointment to have sex! (giggling) For Christ sake. - No! - Can you believe that? - Well that could work. - No it doesn't, she cancels. (laughing) Oh god this is terrible, I shouldn't be telling you any of this. A dog. But it's frustrating, you know I play second fiddle to a cordless phone! - Hey you know that would make a really great song. - Then, if I tell her, I'll lose her. - That is so heavy. ♫ If I'm being myself means losing you (faint singing) ♫ Even when you're home I still feel alone ♫ I'm playing second fiddle ♫ To your cordless phone - God, that's it exactly.

(bell clanging) (perky music) - How 'bout a quickie before breakfast Martha? (laughing) - [Diane] This water is freezing! - [Lesley] You guys, are so chicken. (laughing) - Laura, um, I gotta go to work today, can you make your special cake for Grandpa? - Laura doesn't have time to bake anymore. Diane can make the cake. - Oh sure I'll make the cake. Laura and Jeff could use some time together anyhow. - Get a move on girls we've got a lot to do for the party. - Since when are you such an expert on what Jeff and I need? - What did I do? All I said was that you and Jeff could use some time together. You're so tense! - Hi. - Hi. Mmm. You uh, you smell like grass. And leaves. (chuckling) Kind of a, cinnamony overtones, it's kind of nice. - Do you still love me? (tense music) - Of course I love you. What do you mean still? - More than anybody? - Yes. More than anybody. (romantic music) (telephone beeping) Let it go. (telephone beeping) - I can't. - They'll call back. - Laura Spencer. - I give up. - [Robin] Hi Laura, I have bad news. You didn't make partner, I'm so sorry. - Did anybody? - [Robin] Who do you know, whose uncle is Secretary of State and who can bring in 20 zillion bucks worth of business? - Eric. - Yes, Eric. - What did they say, was there a discussion? - [Robin] Yeah, everybody knows how good you are. They're such jerks, I can't believe this happened. - Thank you for calling Robin, I'll see you at work on Monday. (downbeat music) - Mom sent me for chairs. Are these ready. - Yeah. Where's the plumber? - Where's the wife? (sighing) - Did you talk to her? How did it go? - How'd it go? It went the way it always goes, you know. Computer on the bed and the phone call from the office, and the usual marriage interruptus. - I'm sorry. - You want to come fishing with me? - Jeff, don't go there. - Okay. (sighing) (keyboard clacking) (dog barking) ♫ I'm coffee pot sorting ♫ Coffee pots, they're no good for me ♫ If I can't have a proper cup of coffee ♫ From a proper copper coffee pot ♫ I'll throw you in the sea (telephone ringing) Julia Hartley.

Not, and Eric! That dickhead? That loser, that Jesus Christ that pathetic excuse for a lawyer? (sighing) Honey I am so sorry. - I work my ass off for them and they pass me up for Eric. I'm a good lawyer. - Yeah. - Is the only game in town about getting clients? - That's how it is with those big New York law firms. Maybe if you went to another firm? - If I go somewhere else I just have to start all over again. I don't know, maybe it is time for a change. - Yeah, maybe you should think of a smaller firm. Or a firm outside New York. - Oh I don't know, I'm so confused. - Hey. - Hold me. Mmm. - Why'd you drive so fast? - I'm in a hurry. - God I look like a wreck! Can't you wait two minutes while I fix my face? - Take your time. - [Woman] You forgot the pie!

God I remember this place. - What you've been here? - Yeah I used to come out here to escape from my crazy family. I'd pack a tent and a flashlight and a pile of books. Camp out for days. - [Jeff] Oh yeah right, what'd you eat, bark? - Ouch, after I finished my Oreos? - Nature girl. (laughing) Are you all right? - I used to catch fish and cook 'em. - No way. - Uh huh. - You did that? - Yeah. - Well, you are a country girl after all, I'm impressed. - Oh my god I'd forgotten all about this. - Man you were a stoner too. Damn, I can see the headlines now, pot growing power lawyer busted! That would make your future clear with the firm! (laughing) I'm making a citizens arrest. (Laura giggling) On your knees, and spread 'em! Mmm. God you're sexy. This is just what we need. The great outdoors, fresh air, (Laura laughing) mmm, little birds tweeting away in a bower of love. - Mmm. Mmm, listen. When I was little I used to think the cicadas were saying "Get away, get away, get away, get away." - I figured out how we can get away. - How? - Todd's job at Hudson River Trust is open. I'm gonna take it. - What? (chuckles) Where's this coming from? - You said get away. - No this is where I plotted my getaway from Hudson Falls, not to. - Why I thought you'd want to ease up now. - Ease up, are you crazy? - I thought that's what you were saying! - I have no intention of easing up, I have to work even harder this year to make partner next year! - What? - I've got to nail the Dahlberg case! I don't believe you! - Laura... - I tell you that I don't make partner and your solution is to whisk us off to the burbs. What am I supposed to do out here? Open a fruit and vegetable stand? - Okay, all right, you can stay at the firm and you can come up here on weekends. - Great, great, I'll live in the city and you can live in the country and we'll have a long-distance marriage. - Well Laura, we already do. - [Laura] God you make me so angry, acting on impulse like this. - [Jeff] Laura, wait a second! - [Laura] You know what Jeff? - Ow! - You're just like the rest of my family! Making it up as you go along. - Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa wait! Laura! - I thought I could count on you! - Laura! Fuck! - It's tangled! - Here turn it this way. - No you're making it worse! Will, this is my daughter lawyer, uh, daughter Laura. Will here is helping sort of. - Hi there. - Don't let me interrupt. Hi. - Diane's gone off, you'll have to make the cake. - [Laura] I can't do it Mom, I've got a big meeting on Monday. (mumble), ugh, god, give me a break! - [Julia] Laura! Laura! - I can't take this. Voluntary simplicity. Great. (birds singing) (waves crashing) (languorous music) (geese honking) - Oh, Grandpa. Not that creme, no. We are gong to, bake a cake. Chocolate cake... (water splashing) - Look at you Dad, we can't have you looking like this for the party. - Why? - Jeff! This is no time for a dip for heaven's sake! - Uh... - We have guests arriving at five! Be a dear and wash Grandpa. - Okay. - What what, where are we going? - We're going to take a bath. (vacuum cleaner whirring) (furtive music) (clicking) (thumping) - Mm, that cake smells good. Where's that blue vase? - Mom I just found this in the back of the cook book. They're from Dad, they're 20 years old, you never opened these. I thought that you said that he never tried to contact us? You know about these? - I don't have time for this today my dear. - Mom, stop what you're doing and take the time for a minute, please! - Those are private! - How do you know there isn't anything in there for us? No, how are the kids, a birthday greeting, anything? - That never occurred to me, it was a very difficult time. Finding him with the babysitter, not a pretty sight. - Maybe he tried to explain himself. - I'm sure he did, he was a charmer. But I'd heard it all before. I was terribly hurt by him. I really loved him, I must have, cried for a month, longer! But as it turned out I didn't really need him, I did it all myself. - Maybe you didn't need him - Come on Grandma! but maybe we did? - It's like Steve and Teddy. - [Teddy] Grandma I got to go! - Things may not be perfect with them, but at least they're connected, at least Teddy has a father. - I'm really late for practice Grandma! - In a minute. - I'll take you Teddy. And the cake comes out at 3:20. - Quack quack, quack, quack. - (mumbles), when was the last time you had a bath old man? - Oh, in 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue. - Huh, wise guy huh? What do you wear for the big day? - Oh, you're looking at it. My birthday suit (chuckles). Wha, wha-where's Martha? - Grandpa Martha's gone. Laura may be gone too. - What the hell you talking about, Laura gone? Laura can't! - She had to-- - No, no! - She can't, Laura, Laura! - What'd I do (mumbles). Everybody in this family runs away! - Where's Laura, where's Laura? - Grandpa! - Laura! (dog barking) - Hey, hey hey hey, it's okay! It's okay! - Laura! - It's okay, She's not here! - Laura, Laura! - She's not dead! - Laura! (dog barking) - You seen her last night... - Do you have any nail polish remover? - Have I been a terrible mother? - The worst I ever had. - Did, do you miss having, having a father? - I don't know. I was only two when Daddy left. And Grandpa was there. What I miss is Ron. He's the sexiest man alive, it's like I'm addicted to him! - Take up smoking, it's healthier. - Don't you ever get lonely? - Never. - So Teddy how's life treating you? - Terrible. My dad want's me to come live with him in Chicago, with his new family. - What does your mom say? - She doesn't know. - Yikes. - I promised Dad I'd tell her, I just can't get up the nerve. There is gonna be a big war. - You want me to talk to her about it? - Well that'd be great, would you? - Yeah, I'll talk to here as soon as we get there. - Julia, when am I gonna get that tour of your studio? - Well, you're here now, why not look around? - Your work is so witty. I love it, kind of like a cross between Pitaro and Nicky (mumbles). Do you know what I really like? The playfulness, the voluptuousness. - Are you talking about my work? - You are some woman, Julia. - Look Will, I really think that it-- - I don't agree. - Mmm. This is crazy. - Listen, I'm just as surprised as you are. I guess there are times in life when you just have to let love happen. - I did. I bared my soul to you, I, told you my whole life story at that party. You know all my secrets, but I thought you were leaving the next day, why did you stay? - For this. - Look at you. - (chuckles) Who died? - We're having a party. (train whistle blowing) - [Grandpa] That would be the 3:46. - You've had a good live, haven't you Grandpa? - So far. - Well, if I make it to 85, I hope I have as much to look back on. - There was a young man, from Nantucket. Who made money, by god, by the bucket. Poor sod hated his work. - Yeah, so what'd he do? - I forgot. Hold on, poor sod hated his work, felt like a real jerk, till finally one day he said chuck it! - Chuck it! - Chuck it! (pleasant music) (beeping) (fax machine rumbling) (players chattering) (whistle blowing) - Yeah I'm sorry for the scheduling mix-up. But don't worry, the Tiger's will get their chance. Hi, my beautiful sister. Hey. - See you later Chris, hi. - Hey thanks for picking Teddy up. - Oh no problem. (whistle blowing) Listen, Teddy told me on the way up - He's so excited that you guys are here, he just loves having you guys. Why don't you come more often? - Oh, Jeff just broke the news to me that he want's to move up here. - No way, that'd be so great! (whistle blowing) - Uh, I think he's having a mid-life crises. - Go Teddy, ooh! (whistles blowing) - Anyway why can't you commute? - I already work an 80-hour week. - 80-hour week? How'd he get you to take that trip to the Canadian woods? - He feels like he needs those things for his sanity, but I don't need them. - I don't know. When you came back from that trip you were a changed woman. - Really? In what way? (thumping) - Hey! Ouch, that hurt! (whistles blowing) - Oh look at him! Teddy, he's in another fight, I can't believe this! (whistles blowing) - Break it up! No fighting! Ted, penalty box for two minutes! - [Teddy] He started it! (whistle blowing) - Okay everybody back into positions, all right - Hey! - [Coach] let's start a new face-off! - Look at you! What's the matter with you, you're acting like a little wild animal out there? (whistle blowing) - Did you see that? That was so unfair, he hit me first! (telephone beeping) (telephone ringing) - Hello? - Hi Clifton it's Laura. - [Clifton] Oh hi Laura. - I wanted to know when the Dahlberg meeting was on Monday? - [Clifton] Oh, Laura listen I'm glad you called. Dhalberg had to go to Europe, so we rescheduled for next week. - Great, good, then I don't have to work this weekend. - [Clifton] No, you know it might not be a bad idea to get a headstart. (whistle blowing) - Clifton I'm gonna take the weekend off. - [Clifton] That's fine Laura, have a good weekend. See 'ya Monday. (dial tone buzzing) - Cliff's an asshole! - Hey, hey, don't you say that, you would never say things like that in front of your father! I feel like shipping you off to Chicago to get him to straighten you out! - [Teddy] Just great. (mumbling) - I'm so mad at him. - Honey you don't understand. Steve's been pressuring him to come live with him in Chicago. - What? - Teddy told me in the car and I was supposed to tell you and I forgot. - You forgot to tell me that? Jesus Lora, nice work. Hey, Teddy! (clattering) Come here, I'm sorry, Laura just told me. I never would have said that. - You didn't tell her? - I meant to. - Honey is that what you were trying to tell me, that you want to go live with your dad, and you were afraid to say it to me? - No I want to stay here with you, I just don't know how to tell Dad without telling him about the baby. - Oh Teddy, I can handle your dad, don't worry about that. And, when Grandma moves, we'll get our own little place together, and it can be us, and the baby will be here, and, okay my sweety? I love you so much! (thumping) (groaning) - Nice work Laura. - Clear water home page. Um, let's look at PCPs on the Mississippi. - It's a rubber-stamp meeting. - Uh hmm. - The board will be rooting for you. Everyone in the non-profit world knows the trick is fund raising, so you're background in advertising, your awards are crucial. - Right. - You can catch up on the science later. - Good. - Are you actually going through with this? - Jeff I'll see you guys at the party. - I thought this was still under discussion. - Well you ran off, remember? - Yeah well, I'm here now. Jeff, I realize that I've been so focused on my work... I want to redirect. The issue here is priorities. I know that I need to make more time for us. What if I take weekends off and we rent a house out in the Hamptons? - No, it's more than just that. (sighing) Look I don't know when it happened, but, what makes me happy, has changed. And taking this job is a step in that direction. - What do they pay? - Maybe about a third of what I make now. - We can't afford that Jeff. How are we ever gonna save up to have kids? - Well we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. - You sound like my mother. Dropping out was not part of the deal Jeff. - I am not dropping out, I am changing careers. - No you're floundering! - Laura I have never felt saner! - I (mumbles), then I'm baffled! What is it? - I'm beginning to think being a work junkie may just be an escape. - From what? - I have no idea, that's what I've got to find out! - Are you accusing me of being shallow because I love my work? - No I'm not accusing you of anything. - My last case, I won, 50 workers compensation from being crippled by faulty jackhammers! - God dammit Laura that is so unfair! I did three spots for the ad council and dammit Laura, that's not the point! This is not about work! It's about my whole life! You want to be in the thick of things, I'd be happy living in a shack somewhere. - A shack? - Yes. And something else, I'm sick of waiting to have kids. And I'm sick of pretending to be in a marriage when we're not! We're no fun anymore. We don't play, we don't make love. You don't need me. You won't even miss me when I'm gone. (snoring) (comically furtive music) (suspenseful music) (whimpering) (desultory music) (Will laughing) - Get dressed, I have people coming! (patient music) (rattling) (knocking) - Laura? I just need my clothes. (thumping) - Go away! (doorbell ringing) - Oh, for me! Thank you thanks a lot! - [Will] What a matinee, I can't wait for the evening performance. - Oh, Lord! What have I got myself into (chuckles)? - Flowers, are they for me? - No no no, no, they're for the party. - Well let me see the card, they might be from Ron. Are they for you? Do you have a secret admirer Mom? Who is it? It's that hot guy from Santa Fe isn't it? - Mind your own business! - [Diane] Are you blushing? You're actually blushing Mom! This is a first, let me see the card! - So what did you decide, you gonna go live with your dad? - I'm staying here! - Good move! - How do you know, you didn't even know my dad! - Yeah well I know you're mom. - Oh! - Hey! - [Diane] Hey, back it up. - [Jeff] Okay this way. - [Teddy] This is heavy. - [Diane] You need some help? - No we got it. (sighing) - I look like a lawyer. - Hey Jeff no offense but are you gonna change? - Laura locked me out of the room. - Why? - Well I talked to her like you said, she went ballistic. Thank you. So I took Todd's job. - I thought you guys were married, don't you make any decisions together? - Why don't you get yourselves a drink? Jeff? - Hmm? - Get dressed, people are here. - Laura locked him out. - Diane! - Why? - He doesn't communicate. - Ah the love birds, did you ever seen such devotion? - They're adorable! (chuckling) Julia! Oh I get it, no public displays of affection. - Excuse me, well, there's Dad. Dad? - What's going on with the two of you? - Let's get a drink. (cheerfully perky music) - Julia! - Yago darling thank you for coming! - Ah! A roast pig? You barbarian! When you going to sacrifice the virgins? - First we have to find some. - Oh this is Dudley McGruder, your patron from Microsoft. - What a great pleasure, I love your work! - You have a good eye! (chuckling) - May I take a look around your sculpture garden? - Oh yes come along I'll give you a tour. - No, I'll be fine-- - Listen most people don't know shit about art, you have to tell them what they're looking at, think it's something to buy, like toilet paper. - [Dudley] I think I can be trusted. - Oh yes a thousand pardons, I'm sure you could teach me. - Let me point you in the right direction. Julia's a brilliant sculptor. - Yes she is. - And uh you know, I know a lot of would-be artists, I live in Santa Fe. - Oh, you have my sentiments. - Oh, Julien! Hi! Hey were you guys always this cute? (chuckling) Whoa. (brash Jazz music) - So, you're hot girl. - So are those two the father? - Not even close Sherlock. - Look at their body language, I think they were fucking! - Oh, nah, you know Diane. She treats every man like a lover, that's why they all want her. - Can that be learned, or do you have to be born with it? - Definitely? - Hello. - I'll call you back. - I'm Laura. - Dudley, McGruder. - So tell me about yourself Dudley, are you from around here? - Oh no, no I'm uh, only up here on business. - A working weekend! - I work every weekend. - (laughs) So do I. I get hassled about it by everybody. - Maybe you're, hanging out with the wrong crowd? - Precisely, so tell me about your crowd? - Jeff! We are so thrilled to have a man with your experience coming to work with us at Hudson River Trust. Your ad with the penguin, oh it was brilliant! - Great. - No wonder it might win a Cleo. I mean, a producer of TV commercials. Now that you're taking the job I assume you'll be moving up here. - Well the uh... - Dudley, I need a drink. - Well let's get you one. - Wonderful rustic pattern that goes with the job. - All right now wait a minute, come on you son-of-a-gun! Can't ha, there we go. - My mommma can open it. - Here we go, come on, that's right. (paper ripping) There you are. Aw, - See what it is. (Teddy mumbles) - can't wait, I can't wait, - Oh, oh (mumbles)! - I can't, oh, holy cow! - Jeff! - Excuse me. - This is my cousin Helen. - I'll see you later. - Okay. Hi. - Hi. - He's moving to Washngton. - Todd, it's not official yet. - Hi pumpkin! - What kept you? - Mmm, so hard to park. (chuckling) - They've been apart for all of five minutes. - Jeff! - Eric! - [Eric] What are you doing here? - Well the guest of honor's Laura's grandfather, so... - Oh I didn't know that! - Yeah. - I practice law with Laura, you know, or I did! - Did? Is Laura quitting? - No, I am. When Clifton called last night to say I made partner, I realized I didn't want it. - My handsome precious, it's your call. You've always wanted to go into politics. - So I called Uncle Lewis and he was kind enough to offer me the post of Undersecretary to the Ambassador to, what is the name of that country dear? - Oh it keeps changing depending on who wins the revolution. (chuckling) - Have you told Laura your news? - My darlings, Laura, Presley, I have the most wonderful news for your Mother! An adorable couple wants to buy the house, or at last the property. I think they're gonna tear down the house. - [Presley] How can you tear down this house? - [Lesley] Ridiculous! - [Realtor] Ridiculous? You serve any hard liquor here? - I got trapped into law school by my parents and hated it, and who cares about writs and torts, and pari-passu-- - [Woman] And party of the first part. - And all that Latin lingo crap (chuckles). - Eric, what is he doing here? - I think you should tell Laura your news. I think she would be so happy, for you. - Excuse me... - It's going too far Charlotte, (mumbles). - Julia! Julia wait! My god you look sexy! - Not here, for heaven's sake! - You were amazing this afternoon! - Will, please not now! - Mom, that was so rude! - The last thing I need, today, is an ardent suitor. I have 40 people in the house, my biggest client is here, I haven't had five minutes to schmooze him! - Who do you think you are? Do you bite Will's head off after you've just had sex with him? I saw you in the studio Mom, Christ, you are some kind of role model! You are so militantly self-sufficient! - What's this coming from? - I'm just having the worst day of my life, I'm sorry. Jeff and I got into a huge fight today. - Darling I'm sorry, Laura. - He's decided that he wants to take over Todd's job at Hudson River Trust and move up here. - Oh. - Without me. I'm so afraid of Jeff changing. - Jeff is changing. - I know. - You're changing. People are un-unpredictable. It's what makes life exciting, hmm? - [Lesley] Julia! Julia, we need you over here! - [Diane] Ron (chuckles). - Too many people, too much work. - Drena, I love you. - Hey! - You okay? - Yeah why? - Oh I mean about Ron and Diane. I thought that you guys had something going this weekend. - Oh, no no no, we're just buddies. - Oh. - You know this place will make a great bed and breakfast. - You know I've always thought that. But, I have to make a place for Grandpa, I don't really see him living in Soho. - Grandpa, well we give him his own wing. I mean, you can give him his own wing. (chuckling) I could draw up some plans for you if you want. - You could. - And if you do that, you're gonna need a good plumber. - I know. - Oh have you seen Laura? - She's around here somewhere. - [Jeff] Laura. (guests chattering) - I think Bud the plumber just made this really big move on me. (giggling) - Does he know you're pregnant? - Yes, yes! - Guess, I'd worry about Steve. If he wants to make a fuss about custody he's got a great case. Unmarried mother, un-named father, pubescent boy. - Steve won't be a problem. - (chuckles) Les, look-- - In law school you study hypotheticals, right? - Uh hmm. - Ex husband gets remarried, moves let's say, oh to the Midwest. Gets together with the ex-wife, they go through the storage bins to look through all their old stuff, one thing leads to another, and, let's just say I was Steve's bachelor party. - Oh my god (laughs)! Les! I had no idea storage bins were so sexy. What does Steve say? - Oh, as far as Steve's concerned it never happened. I'm on my own, the new wife wouldn't understand. - Artificial insemination the perfect cover up. - It is a proven gene pool. - That's right. Hey, you look respectable now! - Thank you. All I need is a yellow tie, right Laura? - No, you're not the type. - Ouch. Just been dissed by a strawberry tart. - I think you two need another trip to the Canadian woods. (chuckling) - There a, was a young fellow named Nap, who had a terrible case of the clap-- - Mayor Sweet, Mrs. Sweet, how sweet of you to come. Now that you're here it's time for the celebration part-- - Look this way Mr. McBurney, we just want to get a few impressions of you on this wonderful occasion. - Yeah yeah, I'm the mayor, do I know you? - Is it true what they say about men in kilts? - Well. (camera clacking) - Can you believe this guy was once the mayor? I'm surprised he didn't get further. - A-Attention, everybody! (bagpipes blaring) Not now! Y-You are a surprise for later! - Oh. - I think the mayor wants to say a few words! - Ladies and gentlemen-- - It's a real honor to be here today to help celebrate the 85th birthday of one of our most prominent citizens and former mayor, so, here's to another 85 years! - Thank you! (applauding) - Ladies and gentlemen-- - Dad! To my father, and your former mayor, and everybody's friend Angus J. McBurney! Bud, Bud, lend me a hand. - [Guests] Ah! - Winnie! - It's the dog! (squealing) (chuckling) - It's perfect! - Oh I love you, I love you dear! (exotic suspenseful music) (screaming) (yelling) (comical music) - (mumbles) Teddy, Teddy! - [Teddy] Goliath, where have you been? - Big trouble. All right, whao, hey let's hear it for the man! (applauding) - [Teddy] Thank you, thank you, thank you! - Jeff is so funny. - Yeah. (chuckling) - Grandpa is way too old. - [Diane] I bet you Laura has a gadget for this! - [Lesley] I bet she does. - I want to carry it over, I look really good in candlelight. - Whatever (laughs)! - Whatever. (laughing) - What? Okay grandpa make a wish and blow them out! - Ah! (lips sputtering) (laughing) (clapping) - [All] For he's the jolly good fellow, for he's the jolly good fellow, for he's the jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny! (applauding) - I love this family. - Me too. I think when I proposed to Laura, I was asking them all to marry me, even the old guy. - Water balloons, great idea! - Hey! - Loose something? - Dudley! - The car's here, so I'll be leaving in a few minutes. Oh, traffic's going to be terrible this time of day. - Uh hmm. - All those, Saturday night bridge and tunnel people coming into Manhattan for a little fun. So what do you do for fun Laura? - Ah, oh boy, I get dragged places against my will. Sky Rink, rock concerts in Central Park, roller blading at the pier. (chuckling) Actually that's kind of fun. - Yeah? - Have you ever done it? - Uh no, no, can't say that I have. - What do you do for fun? - Well actually, my brokerage house is having an investment planning dinner on Tuesday night. And I thought that maybe you might join me. There'll be plenty of time to network. - To network. - Yeah. - Um, actually Dudley I have to decline. Thank you though. Sounds like fun (chuckles). - That's a silk tie! - I'm sorry. - That stains! - I'm sorry. (bagpipes droning) - No, no, in a minute, in a minute. - Laura, I have big news for you! - Yes I heard, congratulations. - You heard I'm quitting the firm? - What? (guests chattering) (cans clattering) - That's awfully fast, but it's up to you, that's fine with me precious, (Laura chuckling) it's your call! - Well no I called... - Jeff! Audra loved you, if you've got her vote you've got the board, you're a shoe-in. Here let me help you. - Laura! - I don't believe him! I wanted to make partner since day one of the firm, and my last obstacle just evaporated. - So you got it? - I think I will. - Oh Laura! (laughing) That's really great. - Life happens! You know you can plan, and plan and plan, and, life just happens. - There's another song. (chuckles) I don't believe it Ron was right, my family's my material! I'm sitting on a gold mine here! Ron says the song I wrote last night is one of my best songs, and it's all about you and Jeff and how much he misses you. - Mm, he misses me? - Yeah! - Come on, everybody, it's time for Dad's favorite jig! (bagpipes blaring) (festive Scottish music) - Yahoo! (ominous music) Martha? Martha! Martha are you there? - I'm here. It's Martha.

I saw you talking to Eric. He told me his news. (chuckling) - Lucked out, didn't I? I have to call Robin. - Hey Robin! (chuckling) Now who says I can't communicate? - Jeff I don't blame you for being fed up with me. I haven't been there for long-- - No no no, no no no, it's not all your fault! I'm uncommunicative. - (chuckles) You're uncommunicative and I'm self absorbed. Perfect match. What are we gonna do? (distant train whistle blowing) - [Both] I could commute? (laughing) - [Both] Okay you commute. - Oh... (telephone beeping) - Go ahead, take the call. It's okay. I don't want to stop you.
