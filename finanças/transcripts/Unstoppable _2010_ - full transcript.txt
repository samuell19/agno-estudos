Plenty of sunshine today... with seasonal temperatures... we should reach our normal high over this afternoon. Clear skies tonight... Increasing cloudiness tomorrow, sticky and humid... Hey, hey, hey, hey! Come give me a kiss. You must be good. Bye. Bye. Have fun! Cleve, it's 1955. Please re-enter the clubhouse... in a more stereo typically animated fashion. Hey man, you know where I could find Frank Barnes? Sir? Frank Barnes? Good luck. Thanks. Excuse me, I'm looking for Frank Barnes? You found him. I'm Will Colson. We're working together today on train 1206. 1206. That's the one. That's the profile? Yeah, want to take a look? How you doing? Is there a problem? No problem. I just don't like working in a damn daycare center. Yeah well, I don't like working at a retirement home, or so. Alright! I'll tell you what. I'm gonna finish my coffee. I'll meet you on the wagon. Sounds good. 1206. Yeah, that's the one. You know that punk's Union, right? Heard they just made him a shop steward at the UTU. First year? You know how he got hired? His name's Colson. His two uncles are running things over at Thornwood... and his brother's a lead welder at Deacon. The whole family's from Stanton. Now, that figures. Here, they're shit-canning guys every day... but you got the right last name and a rookie's pay grade... you got a job. Who the hell are these guys? Dewey... Gilleece? Sorry to break up charm school. What the hell is that beast still doing on D-16? I told you I need that track clear. Relax buddy, we were just about to move it. Like hell you are. I've got 150 school students coming in... on some field trip, on D-16. I need that track cleared. D-10's clear, you can set it there. Alright, alright! Settle down, settle down. Welcome to the Railroad Safety Campaign. We are not-for-profit program... designed to educate young people like yourselves... about railway safety. Hey! Settle down. Show of hands. Who's ridden a train before? Me! Me! Me! Alright! All aboard! So, what's our day? They got us going on light power. We're supposed to pick up 25 cars just past Stanton... then it's pretty much a straight shot through Wilkins. Any slow orders? No. You sure? They'd be highlighted in red. No, no slow orders. Alright... Dewey, what the hell is taking you so long? It's a 39-car consist, Bunny. The thing's half a mile long, for Christ's sake. Gilleece, channel up. Go for Gilleece. You believe this shit? Hey, hold up. You forgot to tie the air in from the point. Yeah, so? So, you don't have any air brakes. You can tie the hoses once we got her parked... and Bunny's quit his bitching. Okay. I only got one rule. One rule only. You gonna do something, you do it right. You don't know how to do it, you ask me, alright? Likewise, if you need anything from me, you better speak up... because you're the conductor. Once we get our freight, it's your train. I'm just the guy driving it. How long you been out of training? About four months. Four months? Yeah. Wow. Full-on yellow vest rookie. How long have you been railroading? 28 years. November 13, 1981. 28 years. What did you do before that? Oh... I don't know, a bunch of different jobs. Yeah? No railroading? No, just looking to do something different. Something different? What do you mean, something better? No, no. Just... Different. just different. Hey Dewey, want to pick it up a little bit jag off? I want to have lunch at some point. Yeah. Hey. Your lawyer just called. You got a break. The hearing's been moved up to this morning. Looks like, you'll be going home. Well, that's great but... did you tell him I was working? I can't come in. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He said no problem, man. And he said it's looking good. Alright. Call him in an hour or two, see where it's at. I will. Give me a call. We ready to pull out or what? Coming. Alright. Train's leaving. What's our fuel gauge reading? Fuel gauge? 2900. 2900? Anglecock's closed. Hand brake's knocked off. Good, good, good. Got all the updated division notices and bulletin orders. The POS releases are in. Filled out our time slips. We're good to go. Good! Alright. You're at 29 cars, you got 10 to go, you're good. Dewey, you got 29, ten more makes thirty nine... You taking PB-9 over to D-10? Dewey. Dewey. Hold your horses. What's wrong? Damn trailing point switch. The track's aligned for D-16. What's your stopping distance? At least 20 cars to a stop. Damn it! Okay, so, we back it up and lose a little time. I'm hopping out. Do not get out of that cab, man! Don't worry, I'll set the independent. Dewey! Dewey. Come on, get back on. Dewey! You better get back on! I'm on it. I'm on it. Shit! You better get back on, dickhead! Hey! Shit! Nice job Dewey! God damn it! So, now what the hell do we do? Shh... shoot. Ooh... you're in trouble. Just don't talk about it. Just put your sister on the phone, Sweetheart. Dad! She doesn't want to talk to you. Listen. Just tell her I was, I didn't forget. I was just... I was running late. She's got a date, tonight. With who? Just put your sister on the phone. Wait... here she is. Nic? Nicky? Hello? Listen, just... baby, look, I didn't forget. I was... Frank, the stop blocks are up. Is there a problem? No, there's no problem except you got it backwards. Turntable house goes on my end. You're on the ballast. On my end. Other than that, no problem. No problem at all. Like I told you... if you don't know something, just ask. That's all. I got it. I hope so. Whatever. Excuse me? This shit, this "Let's make the new guy prove himself" bullshit. I gotta tell you, I've heard it before and it gets old real fast. Well, that's how it is at the retirement home. Company wants to get rid of us old heads. They give all the jobs to you new guys, you yellow vests. I'm not trying to take anything from anybody. As reassuring as that is... a lot of guys don't see it that way. I'm here, I'm walking in right now. I got a car full of donuts for those kids. A coaster? What train? Connie? How the hell did this happen? It just got away from me. It got away from you? It's a train, Dewey. Not a chipmunk. I had to leave the cab to throw a switch. You left the cab? Yeah. And it gets worse. The air brakes weren't tied on. They aren't tied on, still.. We've got an unmanned train rolling into opposing traffic. With no air brakes? Is that what you're telling me? I set the independent brakes. That'll for sure stop it. How fast is it going? No more than 10 miles per... Okay, jump on the high rail and go after it. Now! Okay, ballbuster. Call the field trip! I don't care where they are on the main line. They need to get into the nearest siding. RS Campaign, RS Campaign. This is Fuller Yard. Do you copy? RSC answering dispatch. How can I help you? Over. RS Campaign. This is Fuller Yard. We've got unauthorized activity on your track. We're gonna need you to divert to a siding at Portville. Dispatch, please repeat. Please repeat. Over! What time is train time? Anytime! Divert to a siding in Portville. Do you copy? I copy, I'll divert into the siding at Portville, over. Get me 777's cargo information. I have to call corporate and report this. Now, Dewey said he applied the independent. So, friction should stop the damn thing after a few miles. Still. we need to alert every northbound train on the mainline. First 20 miles of track take priority. I don't care if you're talking about... a spot weld on a Class 3 rip track... or ground operations in Afghanistan. It's all about precision. Right. Thank you. Excuse me. Sure. Hello. Ned, where are you? Oh, Connie, hey Um, I'm just driving in, now. I got to go. How far are you from milepost 5? Roughly six minutes, traffic contingent. Great, I need you to haul ass over there... and throw the siding switch. We got a coaster. A coaster? Really? Yeah, it should roll past MP 5 in about fifteen minutes. That should give you enough time to throw the switch... get it off the mainline and onto that siding. You want me to climb onboard and stop it? What? No, no, no. We got two hostlers are on their way. You just throw the switch, Ned. Roger that. You can always count on him to be late. I'll see you later. See you... What do we do when we get to a railroad crossing? Stop, look and listen! I can't hear you! Stop, look and listen! You from Stanton? Born and raised. Yeah? My whole family's from Stanton. Married? Yeah. Well, sort of. It's a long story. We got a long day. How about you? You married? Short story. Once. Got two beautiful daughters though, eighteen, nineteen. They are both waitressing, trying to work their way thru college. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Where at? Hooters. Hooters. You know? Alright. That's right, Hooters. Wipe that grin off your face. I'm a fan. Yeah. You're blushing. I'm used to it. I'm used to it. Connie! Corporate on line 2. This is Connie Hooper at Fuller Yard. I'll hold. Did I hear right? You've got a coaster? Yeah, this sort of thing happens. We're on it. Won't it trip a relay? Yeah, listen, I need to speak to Mr. Galvin directly. I see, can you have him call me, then? No, I'm about to review the cargo shipment on myself. Who the hell are you? I'm here for the Railroad Safety Campaign. Scott Werner FRA Region Two, Federal Safety Inspector. I'm supposed to give a presentation to the children... go over some basic stuff. That's great. Hey, Bunny? Bunny! Can you help me, out here? Okay, see this guy, right there? He's gonna tell you where to sit. Okay. Track geometry, alignment... Thank you so much. I brought some gauges... The kids are gonna love that. It's great. God damn it. Where the hell is this thing? Bunny, I need to know exactly what's in cars 7 to 10? Get a hold of the shipper, please? Are you kidding me? Where's the train? Where does it look like the goddamn train is? It's not here! What are you doing, out here? Do I look like I got a train hidden in my back pocket? Bunny, get me Connie. Get behind us, jackass. It's Ned. Did you get here too late? Don't give me that shit. You know you two numbnuts are always screwing up. You switched the track that was supposed... to get the train on the right track. Connie. Yeah, it's Ned. Did you throw that switch, yet? Yeah, six minutes ago, but your train it's not here. I thought it might be going a little slower than you guessed... but these two numbnuts that you sent... they just showed up and they ain't seen it, either. Are you saying our train already passed? Yes ma'am, that be my guess. It's not a coaster. That train is under power. That be my guess, too. Put Dewey on the phone. Sure. She wants to talk to you, asshole! Yeah? I need you to rally every cell in that brain of yours. When you applied the independent... was the throttle in the forward position? Yeah, I had to get it moving, Connie. In what position was the throttle set? Damn it, Dewey. What position? Connie, the throttle was in notch 8, full power. Okay. It was thirty-nine cars! Okay. Take the southbound track. Catch up. See if it's still going slow enough... for one of you to climb on. You have got until milepost 13 before the track splits. Let me talk to Ned, again. Nice job, asshole! Ned, I want you to get back in your car... and follow the mainline, okay? I want a set of eyes on that train. You got them. Roger that! I can't hear you! Railroad Safety Campaign! You're good. Keep it coming, fifty. Twenty feet. Slow down. Alright, you're good. Yeah. What's going on? You got a minute? I thought he said it was looking good. That's what he thought. Turns out the judge they assigned, was a real hard ass. You gotta be kidding me. Look, the restraining order is being continued for another... thirty days. Thirty days? What am I supposed to do for thirty days, huh? Stay away from my kid? And then there's another hearing after that, I guess. What's taking you so long, Will? You call that lawyer, you can tell him... he can stick it up his ass. I got to go. Will! Pick up the radio. Will! Pick up the radio, over. Are you there? Yeah. Yeah, get off the phone, knock off the hand brakes. Get up here, it's time to go. We got work to do. Copy. No, it's definitely under power. We're not sure of the exact speed yet. I thought all these trains had some sort of dead-man brake. There's a wand the engineer has to hit periodically... or the air brakes are automatically applied. Unfortunately, this train's air brakes were disconnected. Sir, I would gladly explain the particulars... of locomotive operation to you... if we had time, but right now I really need your assistance... posting officers at all the mainline crossings. One question. How do y'all plan to stop it? We're working on it. Go, go, go! The split's coming up! Are you sure you can do this? Just get along side of the cab. Get up along side of it! I'm trying! Go, go, go! Remember, we don't have a lot of track! You got it. Go! Go! Dewey! It's too fast! Back it up! Come on Dewey! Go back! Go back! Jump, Gilleece! Do it! Get in! Watch out! So, now what the hell do we do? How many cars are we supposed to cut in? Twenty, why? Twenty cars. Okay. See the switch stand, up ahead of us? The switch stand, yeah? Uh-huh. Take a look in the rear view mirror, there. You see the one behind us? Way back there. You see it? Uh-huh. There's exactly twenty-one cars between the two stands. Don't ask me how I know. So, why is it, that... there's still more than four and a half cars... that are yet to clear? Because I... Excuse me? Because I cut... Because what? I cut in too many cars. Cut in too many cars, huh? Maybe if you weren't on my ass, the whole time... I might be able to think straight and do my job. Now, what do you mean "Maybe if I..." You been on my ass this whole trip! You're blaming it on me? I'm just saying pick a goddamn job! I got my job! You pick one... Then I pull the throttle... I pull the throttle! It's one, or the other! You're supposed to pull the pin. You're five pins too many. Pull the pins, you're right. Pull the pins. I've had my training, alright? Yeah, but we're out here in the real world. This ain't training. In training, they just give you an "F". Out here, you get killed. I screwed up, okay? Yes, you did. Stop and roll back, and I'll cut the empties. Roll back? Oh, Lord... we can't stop out here on the main. We're more than a mile out on the main... more than a mile to the next stop. You don't take a consist this size that distance, in reverse. Fine, then we'll make the turn at the next siding. The next siding's not for ten miles. We do that, we're late. I don't run late. Just green-sheet it and we'll move on. Come on, we green-sheet it, it's my ass! Cut me some slack. What do you mean, it's your ass? You're a Colson. What the hell is that supposed to mean? That means you can call your uncle... and they'll take care of it. Is that what this is, about? No, it's about the five cars too many. We're gonna stop, roll back and cut those empties! This may be your engine, but it's my goddamn train. Yes it is your train! I'm the goddamn conductor! That's true! 1206, check in. Alright, I'll write you up and green-sheet your ass. Will you? How about that? 1206, this is dispatch. What's your location? Over. Something's funny? No. What the hell are you laughing at? What are you laughing at? Because it's funny. You're a funny guy. Well-trained, but funny. Yeah, this is 1206. We're 60 miles from Wilkins. Forty minutes out of Fuller Yard. Negative 1206, clear your train at the next siding... until further instructed, over. What's up? There's an unmanned train out of Fuller... on the northbound track, over. On our track? A coaster? 1206, we don't have all the details, yet. Just proceed to the next siding and hold tight, over. Next siding's not for 10 miles. Affirmative, 1206. Just get in that siding and sit tight... until we give you the all-clear, over. Affirmative! It's coming right at us. More word on that runaway freight train in rural Pennsylvania. The train, A WVR777... otherwise known as triple 7... left Fuller Yard in northern PA... sometime before 8 am. this morning... and no one was on board. Live, local, late-breaking. The engineer, they say, made an error in controlling the train. Before leaving the locomotive... he intended to apply the independent brakes. And then by the time he realized his mistake... the train was going too fast for him to climb back on. We're being told now by a spokesperson... for the Public Utilities Commission... that this employee will be held accountable. Connie? Yeah. Headquarters is on the phone. It's Galvin. Mr Galvin, how are you? Goddamn it! How could this happen? It's an unfortunate combination of human error and bad luck. Luck? I was a yardmaster for ten years, Miss Hooper. Luck has no business in a rail yard. What are we worried about in terms of cargo? Well, obviously the diesel fuel's a concern. No, I said cargo. Okay, well, cars 7 through 10... and 16 through 19 are carrying a chemical called Molten Phenol. We're still trying to connect with the shipper... to determine exactly what that is. It's used in the manufacture of glue. Can you hold on one moment? You know about Molten Phenol? Yes. Uh, Mr. Galvin, we have an FRA inspector, here. May I put you on speaker? Region 2 Federal Safety Inspector Scott Werner. How can I help? Just tell me what you know about Molten Phenol. Uh, well, it's serious stuff. Very toxic, highly combustible. Oh, that's terrific. Hooper, get state police back on the line. Make sure they got a HazMat team briefed and ready. And ask them to put a spotter chopper over 777. I take it you've sided all rail traffic? On our end, yes. Brewster's notifying its own. Sir... how are we going to handle this? I mean this train is enroute to pass... through some highly populated areas. We're having a strategy call in about two minutes. Alright, I'll be ready. You won't be on the call, Miss Hooper. Excuse me? You'll be advised. For now, coordinate with local authorities. God knows we gotta have over a hundred crossings... that need to be secured. One hundred and seventy-three... railroad crossings... between here and AWVR sub-station in Brewster. Listen, uh... Mr. Galvin... this train is half a mile long... and is traveling at speed, into population... with eight freight cars of hazardous chemicals... and 5000 gallons of diesel fuel. Sir, we're not just talking about a train, here. We're talking about a missile, the size of the Chrysler Building. So, what is your point, Miss Hooper? My point is, after it crosses through Findlay... there's about twelve miles of vacant farmland. But after that, it's nothing but town after town... all the way to Stanton. We have a very limited window, here. So, what are you suggesting we do, derail it? Yes sir, I am. While we still can. Mr. Galvin, I understand that's gonna cost the company... a lot of money, but... Do you think? Miss Hooper, we're not gonna intentionally... destroy one of our own trains. Not when we can still stop it. We can avoid a lot of collateral... I'm going to extend you my last ounce of good will... and pretend this conversation never happened. He thinks I'm worried about my job. Ma'am, please stay in your van. Come on! Please get back into the van. Can you please tell us what's going on? Every crossing's closed off for 20 miles. Ma'am, for your safety, please get back into your van. I'm not getting back in the vehicle. We need to know what's going on. Guys, get out of there. There's a train coming. Hurry! Hurry! It's coming! Come on. We got to go. Get out of there! Move it! Get out of the way! 1206 to dispatch, over. What's wrong? What's wrong? We're not gonna fit in that siding, that's what's wrong. 1206 to dispatch, over. 1206, are you in the siding yet? What's your location? No, we're not in the hole. We're not gonna make it. Can't do it. Too much train. I'm gonna need you to realign the switch... so we can proceed to the next siding. 1206, you have to get off the main, over. I understand that, but you gotta understand this. We're not going to fit. 1206, stand by. That siding's a good 3000 ft, end to end. Check your timetable. It's gonna tell you the siding is 4111 ft. But that's signal to signal. In reality, it's more like 2500 ft. You add those five cars that you picked up... We can fit. No, we won't fit. Dispatch, this is 1206. Can you tell me where the nearest rip track is? 1206, there's one in 6.2 miles. How fast are you going? 55 miles an hour. 1206, go faster, over. Why? Is that coaster still on the main? 1206, 777 is not a coaster. I repeat, it is not a coaster, over. You're telling me it's under power? Get in the goddamn siding. 1206, stand by. 1206, if you're going for it... that rip track is confirmed vacant. It's your call, Frank. We need to throw the switch if you're staying on. We're not staying on! Pull the brake, Frank. We pull the brake and side up. I crash. I know what the hell I'm doing. Bullshit! You're gonna get us killed. Hey! 1206, I need an answer, over. Realign the switch. Over. The train was just going with no one in it. Just took off. We were yelling on the radio earlier... there's a runaway train coming through. It could be coming to our town next. And the high school's right next to those train tracks. Just a few moments ago... a train came barreling down these tracks... We're still going over the numbers. But should 777 derail, we're looking at a major disaster. If even one of those HazMat cars blew... it could easily decimate an entire town. That train is carrying eight of them. Can you please explain to our viewers what you witnessed... Environmental liability, track damage, car and locomotive loss. We're looking at a projected cost easily over $100 million. And the resulting stock devaluation? Our projections indicate it could be in the... 30 to 40 percent, range. Oh! I say we go with Mr. Galvin's option. I've already prepped our sub-station in Brewster. They just need a go ahead. You have it. Okay, everybody out. Hoffman, you stay here. Baker, get me a track schematic, Fuller to Stanton, please! This is Owens. 71, 70, 71 on the gun. So, the red means? 777 blew through a signal. Everything in red means trouble on the mainline. That's a lot of red. Connie, Mr Galvin on line 2. This is Connie Hooper. Have all the mainline crossings been closed? Yes, I've been coordinating with PSP. Do we have a strategy in place? It's already underway. By the activity level behind me... it is evident that a plan to stop the runaway train... is underway. But so far, no one at AWVR is commenting. We just witnessed A WVR employee, Ryan Scott... boarding one of the rescue helicopters. He is a 22 year old Marine vet... who has just returned from Afghanistan. What the hell is this? I need a police escort, now! Whoa! It says here you're a welder. Lead welder. Listen buddy, I don't got a lot of time. Look! you can call my yardmaster, Connie Hooper! Connie sent you? That's what I said. I need your help. 1206, this is dispatch. 1206, we ran the math. At over 2000, you wouldn't have fit. Good call, over. Thank you, but I need to know where that oncoming train is. How far away is it? 1206, we're not exactly sure. You're not sure? Well, find out! I'm high above central Pennsylvania. This train got away... Emergency responders want to halt all activity near the line... and possibly evacuate all homes... within a mile radius of the tracks. There's thousands of gallons of fuel onboard... which is highly flammable. But we're still awaiting word on that. This is Galvin's strategy? Looks like they're putting a train in front of 777... in an attempt to slow it down. Now, they are sending a chopper with Ryan Scott... and the railroad company is still refusing to comment. We've just learned that 26 year rail company veteran Judd Stewart... is at the controls of the engine... that is in front of the runaway train. This is Connie Hooper from Fuller Yard. Is this your guy coming off the helicopter? Still holding at 55. Get her down to 40 and keep braking. Shit! That's it, keep going. Keep slowing. Get her down to 40 and we'll set our boy down. Unbelievable! Do this! Come on. incredibly dangerous... Do this, Judd. Come on! I'm under 40. Is he on, yet? Now! Looks like Marine Ryan Scott has been injured. It's a no-go. Slow down! Just keep braking, try to slow it. Try to get 777 off the main. Switch has been thrown. Slow down, God damn it! Don't side it yet! It's going too fast. Bail! Bail! Bail! Holy shit! Maybe it derailed. Wow! I can't believe how crazy that was. Oh my God! Galvin, you asshole! Fuller Yard, Fuller Yard. This is 1206. We're passing milepost 52... heading northbound on the Main 1. 1206, who am I speaking, with? Frank Barnes, the engineer. This is Connie Hooper, yardmaster at Fuller. Why are you still on the mainline? We were directed to a siding, that's a no-go. We're heading to a rip track just past milepost 5-0. We need to know the location of your yard's train. It just passed milepost 47. Holy shit! They tried to side it, but it jumped the switch... and derailed the lash-up. Lash-up? Who was driving? The engineer, a 26-year rail company veteran... was killed earlier today in Keating Summit... central Pennsylvania. Judd Stewart. Stewart? You said Stewart? Judd Stewart, an engineer from Brewster. You know him? What's your power on the point? 5000 horses, she's not a hotshot... but she's still got some life left in her, over. Give her all you got. Tell Galvin we got two guys out on the mainline... about to play chicken with our train. We tried to stop it. We blew it. What? That train got to go down. The only question is how to minimize the damage. Be quiet! We just learned there is yet another train on this track... headed directly at the runaway. What the hell is this? We gotta learn about it on damn TV? Nicole listen, don't hang up. Don't hang up. Dad, I'm busy, okay? Okay, I understand. I just... Dad? I just wanted to tell you that I love you. Okay fine! Dad, what's wrong? Nothing, nothing. I just... Dad, what's wrong? Just tell your sister I love you both, okay? I got to go. What's wrong? 1206, how are you holding up? About a half a mile from that rip track, over. Chances are, you're going to see 777's nose, any minute now. Affirmative! Why are you braking? Trust me, if we head in this hot, we'll tear right off the track. Oh, Jesus. Get her down to 40 and brace yourself. You need to get at least ten cars into the siding. Yes! Frank, go to 6. Frank, go to 6. Yeah, I'm at 6, go! They're evacuating Arklow. They're going to derail the train. What are they using? Standard DRE. Yeah, a portable derailer. What are you doing? I got a look at that train's last coupler knuckle. It was open. We take off right now, we get back on the main. We can chase it down in reverse. Chase? Whoa, wait a minute. The only way to stop that kind of power, grab it by the tail. Boom, gun it in the opposite direction. We can't just chase it down. If it goes down... we're gonna be a wreck on a wreck. Doesn't matter, there's a good chance the derailer won't work. It's called a derailer, for Christ's sake! That's what they do! A train that size... going that fast, it will vaporize anything that gets in its way. Bullshit! They wouldn't use it if... They're wrong, alright? They're wrong. Are you in, or are you out? If you want to get yourself killed, you do it alone. You know what? Ask your wife what she thinks. Wait! If you're right and that derailer fails... what are the odds it makes it to Stanton? You saw the train, what do you think? 1206, this is Connie Hooper. Are you there? 1206, over. Just wanted to see how you boys are doing. We're doing about 60 mile an hour, Connie. Sorry? Frank, I don't understand. We're going after your train. 1206, I'm not hearing you. The rear knuckle was left open. So, if we can catch up, we can tie it on to our locomotive. Try and slow down 777. Frank, you can't. We already are. Portable derailer's not gonna cut it, Connie. Who said anything about a derailer? Dispatch, they said that they're evacuating Arklow. Two plus two is four. It's Ned. He said he's still following... No, no, no. Tell him I'll call him back. Get me Galvin, now! Frank, that train's carrying 30,000 gallons... of toxic chemicals. They had a window before... but that train's going into populated areas. There's no way they'd derail it now. Are you sure about that? Look, let me make some calls. Make some calls, please. What do you think? Do you think they can catch up? Possibly. But even if they do... we're talking about coupling at ten times the normal speed... in reverse. I thought you were in favor of derailment. Yeah, when they were in the middle of nowhere, not now. It's just town after town, out there! Mr. Galvin says he'd have to call you back. This is Connie Hooper for Mr. Galvin. Mr. Galvin is in a meeting. Then maybe you can tell me. Is the company planning on derailing 777? Last I heard, Galvin was dead set against it. I'm sorry, I'd really like to help you, Miss Hooper. But I'm not at liberty to give you that information. No, of course you're not at liberty to. Frank is right. What's the fastest you've taken a single engine like this? Unattached? Yeah. Fifty, 55. Of course, I was going forward. 1206, you there? This is 1206, over. Frank, you're right... about the derailment. They're planning an attempt outside of Arklow. Tell them idiots, it ain't gonna work. That portable derailer, it's worthless. She already told us. Frank, this is Oscar Galvin, VP of Operations... patched in at his request, open mike. Yeah, we're derailing 777, Frank. It's a done decision. Like it or not, it's our best option, at this stage. There'll be less collateral damage in Arklow. It's already being evacuated... and we can't let 777 make it to Stanton. Look! Mr. Galvin, with all due respect... I've been railroading 28 years. I'm telling you, we got a real chance to stop this thing. No, we already tried. That was from the front. We're long hood, lead back. It's a different situation. We got more control, now. What if I cancel the derailer and you fail, Frank? That train will be doing 70 miles an hour... into that elevated s-curve, in Stanton. The damage will be a a hundred times worse. Right! I'm just telling you, the portable derailer is worthless. You got too much train traveling entirely too fast. Maybe 1206 should just stay on it, as a backup. Look, I am not jeopardizing more personnel and more property... just because some engineer wants to play hero. End of discussion! That train is our property, it's our decision! Now you stop your pursuit, or I will fire you! Fire? You already did. Already did, what? You've already fired me. I received my 90-day notice in the mail, 72 days ago. Forced early retirement, half benefits. So, you're going to risk your life for us... with three weeks left. Not for you. I'm not doing it for you. Frank... let me see that thing. Mr. Galvin, this is Will Colson, your conductor. I'm letting you know, we're going to run this bitch down. Maybe you didn't hear what I just said, Colson. I will fire you! Well, that's too bad. I was just starting to like this job. God damn it, you listen to me, you son of a bitch! You will be fired! You're breaking up. Sorry, you're... This garbage is not... Sir, I think they're gone. This is your headache now, Hooper. Now, you get them off the main... or consider yourself shit-canned, too! I like them. Bring up Beech Siding to Arklow. Take a look behind me, you can see emergency evacuation measures... are currently in effect right here, in the tiny town of Arklow. The lash-up was a no go. 1206 to Fuller Yard. Connie, are you there, over. Frank, I'm real sorry about Galvin. That's okay. Listen, listen. Is he off? Yeah, he's gone. Okay, listen up. I'm going to need you to do us a favor. I need you to keep us posted on the speed and location of 777. Location and speed, over. Connie? Frank, 777's nine miles out of Arklow. You got some catching up to do. Nine miles out of Arklow. What did you say your wife's first name was? Darcy. So, what was the long story you didn't want to make long? I come home from work, two weeks ago... and she's texting on the phone. I ask her, who with? She says, "Nobody". I say, "Let me see the phone". She says no. This goes on, about five or six times. Wait, you're losing me. She's texting... There's this guy we both went to school with. He's a cop, he's a PA state trooper. He's always had a thing for Darcy. Going... way back. 1206, where are you? 1206 here, Connie. We're just passing milepost 5-7. You're about a mile and a half behind. How far out of Arklow is 777? Seven and a half miles. It picked up speed, you better step on it. I'm stepping on it, in it, around it and through it, Connie. Thank you, over. She's texting on the phone. I keep on asking for it, she keeps on saying no, and... she starts to walk away and I grab for it. You hit her? No. No, no, no, no. I mean, I scared her, but I didn't hit her. Anyway, I drive to this guy's house... and tell him we need to talk. Let's take a ride. He jumps in my truck and starts in with... "You got it all wrong, we're just friends". Then he stops once he sees... the gun I got sitting on the dash. Oh! I look him in the eye and I say... "She's my wife, you find a new friend." You pulled a gun on a cop? Frank? Frank, 777 just passed milepost 61. Thank you, Connie. You want to hear the kicker? Yes, I do. It wasn't even him that was texting her... it was my sister-in-law. Anyway, by the time I got home, his buddy's waiting for me. Just waiting to serve me with this restraining order. Darcy wouldn't even look at me. So, I'm living with my brother. There was a hearing today. The judge ordered a 30-day extension. It's like one day everything's going okay and then... And the next, it's all falling apart faster... than you can put it back together. Yeah, never too late, though. The plan to derail this 39-car runaway train... is just minutes away, now. There's a tremendous amount of activity going on. Will this train be able to be stopped? 1206, Connie. We're just passing milepost 6-2. Milepost 6-2, over. Still a mile gap, maybe more. We're not gaining on her, Frank. Hold on. It's just like the shooting range! Alright, here we go! Come on! Let's go! This is it! It's game time! And remember, we're aiming for the red circular button! Now! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! You're shooting the fuel cap. God damn it! Hold your fire! We were aiming to disable it by firing shotgun rounds... at a fuel stop safety switch, and so, some shots were fired. That safety switch is a mighty small target. And it's right next to a fuel tank. We're not gonna catch it before Arklow. Frank, you're closing the gap. You should cut your speed. Allow yourself some stopping distance, just in case. No can do, Connie. If we slow down now, we'll never catch it. Not before Stanton, over. It's your call. However, we have now also learned that two railroad employees... are now in pursuit of train 777, in a single locomotive. It is unclear, what their plan is... Connie Hooper for you. Did I, or did I not tell you to get 1206 off the main? I asked them nicely. You're 100 percent sure that derailer won't work? Yes. 100 percent? No. Which one is it? 50-50. Pretty funny. And if it does? If it does then, we're a wreck on a wreck. I'm here with FRA official, Gene Devereaux. This train is getting close. How is this going to work? Basically, it works like a ramp. The train comes along... this piece here will lift the flange... and pull it outside the rail. That will cause the train to flip over on its right-hand side. Son of a bitch won't even know what hit it. Train's about four minutes out! Guys, come on. Get it started! Guys, come on! It has not succeeded... What? What in the hell was that? That was 10 million pounds of train, Mr. Galvin! And this is the sound of me saving your ass! Frank, do you copy? Frank? This is 1206, over. You were right. It barely bumped. Jesus Christ... We're bringing you live coverage right now... on what could very well result in one of the worst disasters... in the history of the state of Pennsylvania. Now, the particulars are still being examined... but authorities are far more focused... on the potential destruction that would result if train 777... were to derail in Stanton. So, what'd you mean about being married once? Alice, my wife, she died of cancer. Four years ago. I'm sorry. Me too. Me too. Every night I'd come home, tell her about my day. Where I'd been, what I hauled... who annoyed me. Guess I would have made the evening report, huh? Yes, you would have made it, definitely. You should call your wife. I would but it's her day off. She's probably sleeping. Don't make excuses. Wake her up. Been calling for the past two weeks. She still hasn't called me back. She won't, you got to call her. Don't you know how that works? You quit too easy. Darcy! Darcy! I have been calling and calling. What is wrong? As we told you earlier today, those emergency evacuations... began early this morning... as they try to move people out of harm's way. You get a sense of the perimeter, here. You see the firefighters... Hey, it's me. Yeah, we're on our way. Yeah, I know. I'm watching it. Two railroad employees are presently... in pursuit of train 777 in a single locomotive. No one seems exactly clear on what their plans are... should they catch up to that train. It's Dad. We have just learned that railroad employee, Frank Barnes... a twenty-eight year veteran... of the freight company responsible for the runaway... and Will Colson, a conductor, are now onboard another locomotive. We're on our way. A single locomotive trying to catch up... to the runaway train. She's gotta get dressed. And get this, they were traveling... I can tell. She'll be ready in a minute. at speeds of up to 70 miles an hour, in reverse. 777 is now just miles away from the significantly... Come on Darcy, let's go. Come on, get dressed. more populated town of Stanton. Let's go, boys! Okay, you're getting close. The gap's at a mile and 777 is 10 miles to Stanton. Now listen, Frank. I got a guy here named Werner, from the FRA. Now, I'm inclined to defer to your judgment here, but he... Alright, put him on. We could use all the help that we can get. Just press this and hold to talk. It's about slowing 777, once you've tied on. I know conventional wisdom says... to just gun it in the opposite direction. But you'll have a better shot... alternating full throttle with dynamic braking. Yeah, but we can't afford to lose counter-thrust. Well, what you'll lose in counter-thrust... you'll compensate for, in tractive force. Are you sure about that? Well, it's more of a hunch based on some quick calculations. It's a hunch. I'm 70 miles an hour and he's giving us a hunch. Okay, thank you. Put Connie back on, please. It's me, Frank. Yeah, Connie. Does this guy know what he's talking about? In a perfect world... yes. I'd say yes. In a perfect world, okay. We have more now on that runaway freight train... in rural Pennsylvania. They've devised an ambitious plan to bring it to a stop. A single locomotive moves in from behind... catches up, hooks up and then brakes... in an effort to slow it down. Passing milepost 7-6, Connie, over. You're only a half mile away. Half a mile, out. Frank, running in reverse... how are you gonna gauge our gap distance? I could go out there. I could signal you by hand. At 70 mile an hour? I'm asking, would it help? Alright, radio and hand signals. We'll combinate, okay? And be careful. I will. And, oh, take that vest off, too. Why? Just take it off. I don't want to look out this window... and see you in that yellow vest. It'll freak me out. Come on, Will. Pick up. Come on. This is Will, leave me a message. Damn! Ten cars, Frank! Affirmative, over. Alright, here she comes! Three cars? Three cars, steady. Copy. Alright. Steady, steady! Two cars? Yeah, two cars. Copy. Steady, over. Keep it coming, keep it coming! Keep it coming! Steady, steady! ...go into operation. Will Colson is trying to hook up 1206... with 777. Oh, my God. Something has gone terribly wrong. Will, what was that? The grain car blew a seal! Are we tied off? Will, what's going on? Right now we are looking at live pictures of this rescue operation. Are we tied off? No Frank, it didn't work. Our knuckle closed! Will, use hand signals! Hand signals! We tied on? We're good, we're good! What? Oh, shit! Frank, the pin didn't fall! Say again. The what? Will, are we tied on? It's not gonna work. The pin didn't fall. What? The pin didn't fall! It's not locking! Alright, well, look. Try and get down there and see what you can do. Be careful! Be careful. Will! It's not slowing down. It's gaining speed right now. He's reaching down, trying to couple... Will, can you read me? He's gone! Will Colson is down. We do not see him. Chopper 43, can you zoom in? We do not see... the conductor, Colson. Come on, baby. Will, can you read me? Will! Chopper 43, zoom in. There he is. Will Colson. As he struggles to pull himself up... looks like Will Colson is in trouble. The train is coupled. I'm now being told that the connection has been made. It looks as though this train is now attached. 1206 has been successfully attached to 777. But it looks like Will Colson is injured. You alright? I'm great. Hey, hey, don't touch that! Don't touch that boot! Here, just wrap it up with this. Wrap it real tight, all around. You okay? I'm alright, I'm alright. Barnes and Colson have caught up to the runaway train... Darcy, come on. Come on. but the train continues to speed in excess of 75 miles an hour... heading to Stanton. Connie, how far we got? How far to Stanton? Over. Four miles. You guys are doing great. You're cutting it close, though. How's Will? He's, uh... he's different, over. Ready for a little tug-of-war? Let's do it. Match our speed with theirs. Frank, we're gonna snap right off. No, we're not, we're not. We're just stretching, that's all. We're stretching. Here in Stanton... the evacuation procedures continue for the entire town. This is the town where that mainline train track... turns into an elevated curve. They say there is virtually no chance... this speeding, out-of-control train... will make it through that curve. We should be slowing down... which we're not. Shoot. Go to the dynamic. Alternate full throttle. Christ! Those cab brakes are getting a workout. ...because of the highly toxic nature of the cargo. Come on, Frank. Come on, baby. Ah! What's our speed? We're under 50. Connie, how far away? Three miles. FRA's got men on the ground ready to hop onboard... as soon as you guys get it under 20. Alright, tell them be ready to hop, over. Shoot! What is it? We're gaining speed. Consist is too heavy. We're being dragged. Connie! I'm here, Frank. We're gonna be coming in too hot. Let them know. The limit on that curve is 15. I don't know if you can take it much faster, maybe 20, 25 max? We may not have a choice. Just tell them it's gonna be real hot. What about the braking on the freight cars? Good, good. Alright, I'm on it. No, just sit down. No, no. I've got it. Sit tight. I'll go out. Sit down. No, in fact, here, come here. You sit here. I'll go out. Just keep it at four. You alright? Take it easy. Yeah. Hold that dynamic at a four. Four. Integrate it with the throttle, if you have to. Hold it at a four, integrate the throttle. Burn the block out, it doesn't matter. Hey, don't get sentimental on me. Makes me think I'm gonna die. Just hold that four. Come on, Frank. AWVR officials have no comment. Barnes is attempting to manually brake the last car of 777. He's actually running on top of the grain cars and jumping... Way to go, Frank. Let's go, Frank. Looks like 777 is slowing down. We understand this is some sort of... an attempt to try and stop the train. Yes! Come on. Come on! You can do it! Will, how fast you going? Thirty-four. Alright, we're dropping. Thirty-three... The railroad spokesman just confirmed he is... Think it'll work? attempting to slow 777... by manually braking each car. Theoretically. Provided that locomotive's independent brake holds out. We continue to bring you live coverage... of this breaking news event from the town of Stanton. Emergency management officials have created this perimeter. This is the police. Get off the roof. You are being asked to evacuate, for your own safety. Shit! Frank! Yeah, yeah, I hear you, I hear you! We just lost our brakes! Looks like the brakes have blown. Shit! Huge flames... Frank! Frank, you alright? I'm here, Will! What happened? We're picking up speed, again. Can you still slow it down? We're almost at the curve. Frank, our engine block's overheated. I don't think those hand brakes are gonna... have the muscle to stop this thing. We're creeping up fast. Alright, well, just hang on to the independent. I'll tell you when. Elevated and strictly Class 2... speed restricted to 15 miles per hour. Impact with at least three of these buildings... directly below will be unavoidable... as will contact with all the fuel storage tanks situated here. Will? Will. We're alright, we're alright... but we're picking up speed, again. Will! We're coming into the curve! Get ready! Will! Hit that independent! Hit that independent as hard as you can! Frank, we're gonna rip right off. Got no choice! Will! Hang on! Hit it! Hit it again! Now! Frank, you alright? We made it, we made it! We're through the curve. 777 made it. It made it through the Stanton curve. 777 is through the Stanton curve... but by no means out of trouble. 777 is gaining speed. It is out of control and has to derail. Frank Barnes and Will Colson will be... the victims of the biggest rail disaster... in the history of the northeast. It looks like Frank Barnes is making an all-out effort. Good job. This is a remarkable effort now to get to the front of 777. Frank! We're at... we're at 60, and we're going to hit 80 in no time! He's not gonna make it. Looks like the gap between cars has stopped him. You can do it! But the train continues to speed in excess of 75 miles an hour. Frank? Frank! Will, we got a problem here! I don't think I can make it. Oh, God. There's Ned! Unbelievable. Unbelievable! Hello. Ned, it's Connie. I'm kinda busy right now Connie, I'll call you back. Hey! Come on! Hop in the back of the truck! Hop in the back of the truck! Connie? Connie, is that truck for us? Yes it is, Will. You can do this. Will, you can do this! Come on! Looks like he's trying to synchronize... the speed of the pickup with the train. Do it, you pussy! Jump in the back! Yes! Yes! Yeah! Yeah! And look at what's happening now. The red pickup racing to the front of 777. Come on, Will. Frank! Go! Just go! Go, go, go! Go, go, go! Go, go! Ned Oldham is running out of parallel road. Come on, Will. Drive, Ned! He will attempt to board this train. Come on! Shit! God damn it! I overshot it! Come on. There it is, kid! Do it! Come on, jump! Do it! Jump! Yes! Go Dad! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh, my God! Go! Go Will! Will Colson successfully making it into the cab... now in control of 777. Chopper 43 over this remarkable aftermath. We're talking about the heroic work of two men... Frank Barnes and Will Colson. Southern Pennsylvania will always be indebted to them. Judas Priest, we did it! We did it! I knew once we got you up there, we'd do it. I'm Ned Oldham. It's all about precision. Good job, kid. Your foot's hurt. He cut his foot! I think it's broken. He cut his foot! Let's get some medics! Get over here, kiddo. Ned! You! Ned, were you worried? Was I worried? Nah, not really. It's all about precision. I wouldn't have undertaken such a task... Just got off the line with corporate, you know. Oh, yeah? "Debt of gratitude," blah, blah, blah. Same here. Felt pretty good, actually. Yeah, it did actually. ...bringing it to a successful conclusion. What was your first reaction when you realized what was happening? I felt I was in my comfort zone. What'd they say about your job? They said it's mine if I want to keep it. They'd be stupid not to give it to you. Yeah, that's what I told them. Said they better think about giving me a better one, too. How about me? How about you? As you can see, the result was a positive. Ned? Do we have any better of an idea as to how this happened? Well, the thing that happened... Thank you very much, Ned. Everybody, this is Ned Oldham. To answer that last question... Sorry, I wonder if you can help me. Connie? I can't decide which one of you I'm gonna kiss first. Me. Problem solved. Go get him, Connie. Alright, bring it on. To Frank Barnes and Will Colson... the engineer and the conductor whose actions... Your daughters? Chopper 43, over and out.
