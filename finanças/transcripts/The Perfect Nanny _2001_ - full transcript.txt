Attention, all visitors and cavalry of psychiatric, visiting hours will conclude in 20 minutes. (gentle music) - [Andrea Voiceover] Quinton saw a worried look in Mandy's eyes, he gently turned to her. - I can tell something's troubling you, what is it? - Everyone thinks of me as being your child's nursemaid. I'm afraid people will never accept me in your world. (gentle music) - You're the most gracious, wonderful woman in Connecticut. They'll adore you, you'll see. - Are you sure? - Completely. - [Nurse] Are you ready, Andrea? - Yes. - New book? - Oh no, this is my favorite. I've read this a million times. - Then it's a classic, I'm sure. - You should subscribe. It's the world, the way it should be. Men are gentlemen and women are ladies. - Won't that'd be the day. So who's taking you home, your mother? - No, she doesn't even know I'm leaving. Like you said, this place would have done her more good than it did me. Well it's 'cause she let go of the only good man she ever had. The only man I ever had was loser. - Speaking of which, this came this morning. - My name is McBride not Hatfield. - He's persistent, I'll give him that. - Well, it doesn't matter, I'm not going back to him. I've got a new life to start. (gentle music) (telephone rings) True-Care Agency, how can I help you? Yes, just hold a moment please. No. Hello. - Listen sir, it sounds to me like you want a nanny for you and not your children. And we don't provide that kind of service, good day. Some men, honey. - Dr. James Lewis. Oh, he's a widow. Needs a live-in nanny to care for 10 year old boys and light cleaning and cooking. Surgeon at St. Mary's hospital. Wonder what he looks like. He lives on Somerset Court. Bet it's a beautiful neighborhood. - Hi, I'm Rosalee, I'm here to see Doris. - She's in her office, go right in. - Oh, I'm sorry, talk about flashback, you remind me of an old friend of mine, Nikki Harcourt. She used to be a nanny here. - I get that a lot, actually. She went to Paris, right? - Lucky girl. (Rosalee laughs) Okay, well I'll just go in, thanks. (suspenseful music) - Doris. - Yes. - I know, I'm sorry to bother you. I'm just, I'm not feeling very good today and I was wondering if maybe I could have the rest of the day off. - [Doris] Can Jackie fill in? - Yeah, Jackie can cover for me. - [Doris] All right, feel better, honey. - Thank you, thanks Doris. (suspenseful music) - Neurosurgery. So handsome. (suspenseful music) (car engine roaring) So beautiful. Look at this, your daddy is on the board of directors at St. Mary's hospital, that means he's really important and he's one of the most renowned surgeons in his field, it says so right here. Do you know that your daddy went to Harvard and Yale? You wanna be like him, you better get all your homework done and study hard. I'm gonna be the perfect nanny. Got crumbs on your head, sorry. (suspenseful music) (telephone rings) - Hello. - Dr. Lewis. - Yes, this is he. - This is Nikki Harcourt, I'm not with an agency, but a friend of mine told me that you were looking for a nanny. - Yes, but I've already got five people, interviewing later today and tomorrow, so. - Dr. Lewis, I worked for the same family for eight years. I took care of two boys by myself. I cook, I have my own car. - All right, all right, all right. Why don't you come by tomorrow, let's say around 11:30. - I'd love to. - Do me a favor, fax me your resume and salary history. I'd like to review them before we meet. - No problem, I'll get them to you right away. - [Dr. Lewis] All right, bye, bye. - Goodbye. Yes. - [Man] Here you are. - Thank you. - You're welcome. (gentle music) - This is great. Yes. (shower water runs) (Andrea laughs) Hi, I'm Nikki Harcourt. It's nice to meet you, Dr. Lewis. You'd like me to call you James? Well, hello James. (car engine roaring) (suspenseful music) (car engine roaring) (door bell rings) - Hi, Nikki, right? - Right. - Come in. I'm Fawn. - Hi. - Wait a minute and I'll get my dad. - Okay. (basketball bounces) - Hi. - Hi. You must be Ben. - I could be Ben. I don't have to be. I could just be a kid who walked in off the street, you know. - I can tell you're smart one. - My IQ's 162. - That's very impressive. - So do you know what a C10-1140 is? - It sounds like a plane. - She guessed it was a plane. (Fawn laughs) - Congratulations, you're the first. - Hi, I am Dr. Lewis and that's Ben's test. It's actually a model airplane, he's especially fond of. (pager beeps) Would you please excuse me? - We could play ball until he gets back. - Come on, let's go sit down. I am so glad we're getting Ben another nanny. The last one moved to Chicago, I guess about a month ago. And I'm leaving study at Cambridge in England. - Oh, that's so exciting. So you're in college? - Yeah, USC. I'm a majoring in English Lit. - I love English literature. - Really? Who's your favorite author? - Oh, wow, let's see. - I apologize. It's hospital business. Well, I have to say your resume is quite good. I mean, eight years with one family. Why did you leave them? - Oh, they died in a car crash. - That's awful. - Oh my God. - After it happened, I went to France, took a break. - Well, I certainly understand. You don't happen to speak French, do you? - I didn't stay long enough to pick it up. - The young lady, Beth, who was here just now is fluent in Spanish and offered to teach Ben. And I have to think that, that's a big plus, especially living here in Southern California. So please understand, I think you're more than qualified. It's just that I'm leaning in that direction in hiring her. I just thought she should know now instead of waiting for a phone call, I'm sorry. (telephone rings) - I'll get it. - Yeah. - You didn't even talk to her. - As you can see, this isn't easy for either of us. - Ben and I could learn Spanish together. - I appreciate that but. - I don't wanna learn Spanish. - Ben, how many times do I have to tell you not to bounce the ball in the house? - [Ben] It's just a stupid ball, dad, come on. - [Dr. Lewis] Look, that's enough. Just take it outside, okay. - Okay. - Dr. Lewis, thanks anyway for considering me. And if things don't work out with Beth, please do give me a call, I really would like the job. - You can count on it. (suspenseful music) (door knock) - Hi, I'm a friend of Bryce Ellison, your neighbor. He was supposed to meet me here half an hour ago and he hasn't shown up yet. And is there any way I could borrow your phone, just to call him at work? I came all the way from Pasadena and it'll only take a second. - Okay, sure, come on in. - Thank you. - Excuse the mess, I'm moving. The phone is right over there on the table. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I thought he was on vacation. - He came back early. - Hello, can I speak to Bryce Ellison please? Hi Bryce. Hi, it's me, I've been waiting here for about half an hour. No, I didn't get a message. Okay, well I'll just, I'll just wait. Okay. I'll see you then. Bye. He's on his way over. - Oh good. - You've got such a cute place. - Thank you. - Why are you moving? - I got a new job. - Really, what do you do? - [Beth] I'm a nanny. - Do you like it? - It's a paycheck, you know. But my new employer seems really nice. He's a doctor, very handsome. But I'm not gonna do this the rest of my life. I can't take these spoiled, rich kids forever, you know. - Don't worry, you won't have to. (Beth screams) I'm sorry but James really needs me. This is so pretty. - [Fawn] It was such a shock, what happened to Beth. - [Andrea] I know. - Anyway, this is dad's room. And this is Ben's room and it's always a mess. - It's my room, I can do what I want. Hi. - Hey you. - My room and this is your room. Television, you have your own phone. My dad will pay for all your long distance calls, as long as they're not outrageous. - Fantastic. What time does your dad get home from work? I should probably unpack and start cooking dinner. - Oh, we never know, sometimes it's late and sometimes it's even later. - Well, you can't blame him for working hard for you guys. - Yeah, true. Well, I've got a lot of studying to do. I'll leave you to get settled in. I'm really glad you're here, Nikki. - Yes. Feels like home, already. (gentle music) Thank you. (gentle music) Sleep well, my love. It'll be a hard day. We'll have so much to celebrate. - [Andrea Voiceover] The next morning, as they sat in the gazebo, she asked when he first fell in love with her. He smiled and said. - It was when we last celebrated your birthday. - We had a picnic at the river. - There were swans in the water that day, as I recall. You were admiring them. You looked so beautiful. It was dusk. The water reflected on your face. That moment, I know I was in love. - My James won't let me down. - [Dr. Lewis] I can't believe Tessinfell is agreeing to this. - Well it's Conrad. He's convinced two other partners to change their votes too. - Speak of the devil. - Doctor. Julia. - Conrad. - Don't let him get you down. A lot of them haven't made up their minds yet. - They think they know what they're getting into. You just wait, til the HMOs start telling them how to treat their patients. - You're tired. Let's get outta here, get a bite to eat. - I can't. I'm speaking to the board of review next week and I haven't finished that damn speech yet. - Well let me help you. We'll go to your place, raid the refrigerator, put on a pot of coffee and brainstorm. - Well, I just hope you're up for a long night. - I can handle it. (door knock) - Hi Fawn. - Oh, hi. - Your father invited me over for dinner. I hope you don't mind. We've got some work to go over tonight. - Where's Dr. Lewis? - Oh, he's parking the car. Hi, I'm Julia. You must be Nikki, the your nanny. You are going to love it here. - Excuse me, I have to set the table. - Sure. - I'm sure she invited herself. - Who is she, is she a friend of the family? - No, she's a surgeon at the hospital. - You don't seem to like it very much. - Got that right. - [Julia] This is wonderful, Nikki, you're quite the cook. - [Nikki] Thank you. - [Ben] Yum, I love apple pie. - Nikki is spoiling us with all this good cooking. We are one lucky family. - You know what, I'll have to have you guys over to my place next week for barbecue and we can go swimming too. - Cool. - That'd be great. - I mean that is, of course, if Fawn can take some time off from her studying. I hear you are doing very well. - Yeah. - Look, Julia and I have some work to do. Nikki, could you bring us some coffee in the living room? - Of course. - Thank you. - [Julia] Thank you. - [Ben] I'm gonna watch TV. - I hear you're doing very well. She doesn't care how I'm doing, she just acts like she does. - Why would she act like she's interested if she isn't? - It's all a show. She's been after my dad ever since my mom died, a year ago, it's sick. - Well, do you think that he's interested in her? - The more time he spends with her, the more he seems to like her. I'm sure she's determined to marry him. - Your analysis is dead on. - Not bad for a stuffy old doctor, huh. - Since when are you stuffy? Old, maybe. (Julia laughs) Old, oh, hey, hey, hey. - Yes. - Yes. - Excuse me. I brought your coffee. - Thank you, Nikki. - Thank you, Nikki. - I know, but maybe more. - Yeah. - Help. Dr. Lewis. - Nikki? - What is it, what happened? - There was a knife in the dish water and I cut myself. - Oh, God, oh. - All right, all right. - Ow, ow, ow. - It's not that bad, but you're gonna need stitches. Apply pressure, raise your arm up, I'll get my car keys. - Oh, I can take her to the hospital, you stay here and finish your speech. - You don't have to do that. - It's okay, don't worry, it's no problem. I'll take good care of her. Come on. - Okay. Okay, thanks. (car engine roaring) - So how long have you known James? - About three or four years. - You like him a lot, don't you? - He's a very special man. (phone rings) Hello. Oh, Steven, hi, how are you, sweetie? Can I call you back in the morning? Oh, okay, sure. Oh, I'd love to have dinner. Next Wednesday sounds great. Do you wanna pick me up around eight? Okay, great, can't wait to see you. (telephone rings) - You may want to rethink your position, Julia. You know what happens to people who end up on the wrong side of things? - What the hell are you talking about? - You're letting your personal feelings interfere with your judgment. - Fuck you, Conrad. - Anytime - Who was that? - That's Dr. Conrad. How are you? All stitched up? - Oh yeah, I'm fine. - Great, let's go. - There they are. Thanks for everything, Julia. - It was my pleasure. I'll see you tomorrow, okay. - All right. - Goodnight, Nikki. - I am glad you're all right. - Nothing a few stitches couldn't cure. Did you finish your speech? - Yeah, almost. - You must be really tired. Do you want anything? - No, no, no. I'll just be another half an hour and then I'm gonna hit the sack. You should go and get some rest too. Good night. - Good night. (gentle music) He works so hard for us. (ship horn honks) (ship boards creak) - What you got, Nikki? - Oh, it's just a little project I'm working on. - Yeah, what is it? - Tell you what? If you do your homework and you eat all of your dinner, I will tell you what's in the bag, okay. - All right, deal. - Dr. Lewis, I heard you gave a great speech to the review board. - I tried my best. - Unfortunately for you, Howel and Decrane have already assured me that I've got their vote. See you tonight at Dr. Terask's retirement party. It's too bad, he can't help you. - I really don't want to go to this party. - Come on, Dr. Terask is your friend. You can't let Conrad spoil a good time. - I know, I feel like I've got a knife, sticking out of my back, every time I hear his voice. This is. Will you? - Here let me do that. Remember that talk we had about a month ago about going up to Big Bear? - Yes. - Well, I went ahead and made reservations for this weekend. - Julia, we can't go now, what with everything that's happening at the hospital. - Why not? Nothing's gonna change at the hospital, if you're gone for a couple of days. - Yes I know, but. - [Julia] And you've got a nanny now to watch the kids, so they'll be fine. - Don't do it, James. - Well, you do present a persuasive argument. - You need a little more convincing? - Don't do it. - Just a little. All right, all right, let's go, let's go. - It'll be fun, come up. You look gorgeous. - And you. (door knock) - [Ben] I'm done with my homework. - Come on in, Ben. Here you go. - Nikki. This is way cool. Hey, Fawn, see what Nikki got me. - Wow. Have to work at Boeing to figure a thing like that out. - Hey listen, kiddo, why don't you go into your room, start putting this together and I'll be right there, I gotta talk to your sister. - [Ben] Are you gonna help? - Yep, two minutes. - Two minutes. - Two minutes. - [Ben] All right. - So these are your books. - Yeah, you can borrow whatever you want. - Where did you get this? - Well, I figured I should learn something about the guy I'm working for. Who's Andrea McBride? - Oh, she's a friend of mine, I stayed with for a couple of days, I borrowed her library card. (Fawn laughs) - You're in trouble, this book it's way overdo. - Bad habit of mine. Listen, Fawn, I need to talk to you about Julia. After what you said, I'm concerned for your father. - Why what's the matter? - Well, I was in the hallway and I saw her in his room and I happened to overhear her, trying to convince him into going to Big Bear for the weekend, just the two of them. - I can see it now. On Friday, they dash off and by Monday, they come back a couple. - I'm sorry, Fawn. Fawn and I are going to be great friends. - [Ben] Nikki, are you coming or what? - Be right there, Ben. - [Rebecca] That's right, Dolly, you make 50 cents off of every bottle that Cheryl and Tara sell. - [Dolly] Count me in. - All right, that's the spirit. (telephone beeps) Oh, I have another call. I'll talk to you later, bye, bye. - [Dolly] Bye. - Nature's Kitchen, Rebecca McBride speaking. (Troy laughs) - What the hell are you selling now? - Troy, are you back in Anchorage? - Yeah, I got one more week's work and then I'm done. So what's going on with Andrea? - I don't know how to tell you this, Troy, but well, she's gone and I don't know where she is. I called that nuthouse and they said she left sometime ago. - Well, what the hell were you doing? - Listen, they gave her an early release. - I don't really care what they gave her. When I'm out of town, you're supposed to keep an eye on her. I give you enough damn money. - Now calm down, Troy. - You stupid bitch, now I'm gonna have to go and find her. - She'll come back home. She always does. - Yeah, and what if she doesn't? - She will, trust me. - Yeah, right. - So she went ahead and made reservations without telling you. How thoughtful of her. - Fawn, we have both been working very, very hard lately and we just need a break. - Long enough, so you could sleep together. - I can't believe you just said that. - And I can't believe you'd do that to mom. (door knock) - [Fawn] Nikki. - Come in. Are you okay, Fawn? - He is going to Big Bear with that woman, for sure. - You know, I didn't want to say anything before, but last week when we were driving to the hospital, Julia got a call from somebody named Steven. It sounded like they were lovers and they made a date for tomorrow night. - Why am I not surprised? I knew she was just using him. Did he say where he was gonna be taking her? - No, but I know he's picking her up at eight o'clock. - Tomorrow night? Thanks, Nikki. I'm really glad I can talk to you. - I just want this family to be happy. (car engine roaring) - Wow, punctual boyfriend. - Hi. - Hi, honey, it's good to see you. - What a slut. (car engines roaring) - [Julia] Looks crowded, we gonna wait too long. - Dad. Can I talk to you for a sec? - Yeah, sure. - I think Julia is seeing somebody else. - What makes you think that? - Well, I was out last night and just happened to see her with some other guy. - You just happened to see her. (plate breaks) - Sorry. - It's all right, forget about it. I've gotta get outta here and over to the hospital. You know, just for the record, his name is Steven, he's an old college friend of Julia's and whenever he comes to town, she does everything she can to see him. - So she is seeing him? - Not likely. He's decidedly gay. You know, it makes me sad that you don't like Julia, but I respect your right to feel that way. Just don't start coming at me with rumors. - Guess that means that he's still going away this weekend, with Julia. (suspenseful music) (Julia screams) (car engine roaring) (car doors close) - Hey, go on up, I'll help you hang up your suit. Dad, I just want to say I'm sorry about Julia, I really am. - Why don't you go sit down and I'll make you something to eat. I made you your favorite, Avocado and Monterey Jack. - Oh, thank you. Nikki. - Yes. - I haven't really thanked you enough for everything you're doing. I really consider you part of our family. - I really feel like part of your family. (gentle music) Everything's gonna be all right. - Thanks. - Edna, forget the multivitamins. I mean, we can't do squat against those free radicals. You need something with a lot more kick to it. You need antioxidants. And think, honey, for your stomach problems, ginger root. (Rebecca laughs) What did you do that for? I had a sale. - I am tired of you gabbing on this phone all goddam day. - But that's what I do. - No, that's what you used to do. What you're gonna do now is help me find your daughter. - And how am I supposed to do that? - That's your problem. But if you don't figure it out, I'm cutting loose and I'm taking my money with me. And then we'll all see if you can live off this fucking voodoo crap. - [Andrea Voiceover] The next morning, as they sat in the gazebo. - She asked when he first fell in love with her. - It was the last time we celebrated your birthday. - We had a picnic down by the river. - The swans were on the water that day, as I recall. It was dusk, water was reflecting on your face. I knew it that moment that I was in love. (car engine roaring) - Wow. - Oh, shoot, my laptop. - This was yours, wasn't it? (car engine roaring) Good evening, Dr. Clarence, how are you and your lovely wife this evening? And you Dr. Roberts, so nice to see you again. Well, if you'll excuse us, my husband, James has promised me the next dance. - What are you doing? Who are you talking to? - Oh, these dresses are so gorgeous. - They belonged to my mother. - I was just admiring them. The beading is amazing. - Could you please give me my mother's gown? - I'm sorry, I'll put them back. - No, I'll do it. - Dr. Lewis, some important issues have come up, I'd like to discuss them with you. - Oh, and what are they? - I won't take up much of your time. - Dad, what's wrong? You seem really out of it. - Conrad, lowered the boom today, told me if the HMO takes over, I may be asked to leave St. Mary's. - He can't do that. - Yes he can. He's in with them, very tight. - After all the years you spent there. You made that surgery department. - Well then, I have to go someplace else and start all over again. - [Ben] Nikki, you promised you'd play me a game. - Be right up, Ben. - Dad, I need to talk to you about Nikki. - What about? - I think she wants to be more than just a nanny around here. - What makes you say that? - You should seen her face light up when you hugged, after Julia's funeral. - Come on, Fawn. What do you think she's interested in me? - Yeah. - Well, how flattering. - Dad, I found her in my room today with one of mother's evening gowns, talking to herself. - Look, your mother's gowns are very, very beautiful, Nikki probably doesn't have any clothes like that, so what is the big deal? - There's just something weird about her. - All nannies are weird. Do you remember Jenny? She read all those medical journals and then tried to discuss them with me. I mean just forget about it. - It's different. - Fawn, now you're going to be leaving in a few weeks, you got a lot more important things to be worried about. All right? - Okay. So what are we gonna do about Conrad? - [Dr. Lewis] Not much we can do, just wait and see what happens. - Don't worry James, it's all gonna work out. - Hello. - Yes. - Hi, this is Lyn from Dr. Bruce Harley's office. I have to messenger some papers over to Dr. Conrad and I was wondering what time he would be leaving tonight? - [Woman] Around eight. - Eight o'clock? - Yes. - Yeah, that's fine, that should give me plenty of time. Thank you very much, bye. - I'm serious. I hear London is cold and wet this time of year. Nikki, enjoy your night off, huh. - You too. (suspenseful music) - Excuse me. Hi, I can't find my car, I was wondering if you could help me out. - You should talk to security, they're inside the main lobby. - Well, the thing is, I think it may have been stolen. So I was wondering, can I borrow your cell phone to call my husband? - Look lady. (dramatic music) - I can't let you hurt James. (car alarm rings) - [Dr. Lewis Voiceover] It was the last time, we celebrated your birthday, I knew at that moment that I was in love. - Happy birthday, Nikki. Love, Marilyn. Drink all that, this time. - So are you ready for your finals? - Yeah, just wish they weren't all on the same day. - Ooh, crunch time, huh. - Yeah, no kidding. So Nikki, what you end up doing last night? - I saw "Haunted Love." - Really? I didn't know that was still playing. Where'd you go see it? - At the Broadway Mall. - That's weird. I drove by there yesterday and they were closed for renovation. You didn't go to the movies last night, did you? - Fawn, that's enough. - No, actually she's right. I didn't. I made it all up. - So where'd you go? - Well, it was supposed to be a surprise, but hold on a second. - What are you getting at? - Dad, she's playing us all. I don't know what her angle is, but. - You are so out of line with this. - What's your problem, Fawn? - Fawn, I looked around a long time to find something, I thought that you would like. It's kind of a going away present. Sorry, I didn't have time to wrap it. - Are you happy now? - You better apologize. (telephone rings) - Hello. Yes, just a second please. Dr. Lewis it's the hospital. - Hello, Dr. Lewis. What? Oh my God. Yes, yes, I'm not no way now. - Dad, what's wrong? - Conrad, he, Conrad was found murdered last night in the parking lot at St. Mary's. - Oh my God. What happened? Do they know who? - I don't know, the police think it was a mugging. His wallet was missing. - Come on, kiddo, we gotta go to school. - [Ben] Who's Conrad? - He was a bad man who got what he deserved. (dramatic music) - Let's see. I know it's here somewhere. Okay. Employed for eight years to Mr. and Mrs. Daniel Jones. New Hampshire, blah, blah, blah, blah. Entire family died in a car crash. There are no living references. Must be someone who knows something? - [Troy] You're wasting your time, I already looked through those files. - Dammit, Troy, been racking my brains. I've been calling everybody I know. What do you want me to do? You want me to take out an ad on television? - Somebody's gotta know where she is. - The question is, who? Of course. She'd never stop reading these. And I'll bet you, she gave 'em a forwarding address. - Damn mama, you're an education. (Rebecca laughs) - Hi, my name is Fawn Lewis, I am trying to reach the relatives of Susan or Daniel Jones. Could you call me back at 818-555-3726 - [Andrea] I love seeing Ben so happy. - Oh, he adores you, Nikki. I haven't seen him like this since before his mother died. - I wish Fawn liked me as much. - Yeah, Fawn's had a tough year, with her mother gone and she's just become a little possessive of Ben and I, that's all. - I just hope that she and I can make friends before she goes away to England. - Well, she's as stubborn as her father. Give her a little time, she'll come around. - Nikki, it really works. - It's great. - [Tanner] James, this is the pleasant surprise. How are you doing? - [Dr. Lewis] Oh, fine Tanner. Good to see you. How are you? - [Tanner] Terrific, and I don't believe we've met. - Forgive me, this is Nikki Harcourt, she's our nanny. Nikki, this is Dr. Tanner Wallace, he's the Chief of Staff of St. Mary's. - Please meet your, Nikki. - Likewise. - Listen, James, since the unfortunate death of Conrad, some of the partners are starting to rethink their position on the HMO. - I wish it was under better circumstances. But I must say that as good news. - I thought you'd like to know. See you Monday. - Thank you. - Congratulations. - Dad, Nikki, this is so cool. - Can you take a picture of us? - Yeah, sure. Okay, hold it right there. (suspenseful music) Do you have a birthday coming up? - Yes, I do. - When is it? - Friday. - Well, why didn't you say something, huh? - I don't know. Birthdays were never really a big deal in my family. - They're a big deal in ours. - That's right and we are not going to let this one slip by. Now, do you have any plans? Your friends taking you out? - Well, most of my friends are back East, except for Marilyn, she's out of town. And this is from Marilyn. - So what are you gonna do? - Well, I was thinking about taking myself to a nice French restaurant. - Oh no, no, no, no, no, you're not going to sit all alone in a restaurant. - I know, that's boring. - Let us take you. - Oh no, I couldn't let you make a fuss. - No, I insist. I have a perfect place in mind for us to go. - Well, I don't know how I could say no. I'd love to. - Good. - Cool. - It's a date. Can I talk to you for a minute? - I'm studying right now. - Well, it won't take long. Your father and Ben have invited me for my birthday, on Friday, to dinner. Do you wanna come? - That's the night my friends are throwing me a farewell party, I can't. - That's too bad. - I know. Maybe next year. - Good, little bitch won't be here. (suspenseful music) - "Hey Fawn, I never heard of Daniel Jones, sorry. "Jonathan MacDougal. "P.S. What do you look like?" Great, pervert. (suspenseful music) (car engine roaring) - Maybe too sexy. He'll love it. Hi, this is Nikki, Ben's nanny. I'm fine, thank you. You know, I don't know about Kenny, but Ben has been dying for a sleep over and I was thinking that if Ben could stay with you tomorrow night, then we could have Kenny over next Friday. Great. Oh, thank you, that would be great. - "Dear Miss. Lewis, "sorry it's taken so long to write back. "I've been out of the country for last week. "Susan was my sister. "She did have a nanny named Nikki Harcourt "and she was wonderful. "I hope this helps you, "Jason MacDougal." Great. She was a wonderful. - [Andrea Voiceover] After they finished the birthday picnic, Quinton tenderly took Mandy's hand and led her back to Wrightwood Manor. He drew her close and peered deeply into her eyes, so deeply that she almost felt afraid. But the warmth of his touch soon quieted her. - You're so beautiful. - Kiss me. - [Andrea Voiceover] She said. And then he embraced her with a love that was so strong, so pure that they surrendered completely to one another. And she was happy for the first time in her life. Tomorrow, James, it's the day our dreams all come true. (car door slams) - So you're gonna be ready at two, when I pick you up. - Yeah. Are you sure, it's okay that I go to Kenny's and not your birthday dinner? - Absolutely. You're gonna have a much better time. - [Ben] Okay. Save me a piece of cake. - [Andrea] Two pieces of cake. (suspenseful music) - No pictures, of her family. Must be something. "The Passion of Mandy." "A desirable young nanny works for a powerful widower. "The gentleman falls in love." I knew it. (suspenseful music) Where's the library card. Shoot, I'm outta time. (car engine roaring) - This oughta be nice and chilled by tonight. (door bell rings) Who could that be? - Hello, Andrea, happy birthday. - Troy. - What's the matter, cat got your tongue? - How did you find me? - Nice gig you got going here. But I like you better with long hair. - You cannot stay here, you've gotta go. - I don't think so. - If you don't leave right now, I'm gonna call the police, okay. - Oh, you won't. Now go upstairs and pack your stuff, you're coming with me. - I have a new life, Troy. I don't want to be with you anymore. - New life, my ass, you are my wife for Christ sakes. Now, get going. - What about all my stuff, my books and my car. - Fuck your car. Now hurry up before I drag you outta here. It's your choice. So why'd you disappear, huh? You late for something? - I'm supposed to pick Ben up two o'clock. - [Troy] Gee, that's too fucking bad. - You don't own me, Troy. - 'Til death do us part, remember Andrea. Sounds like I own something, to me, like maybe your loyalty. - Loyalty. You are talking to me about loyalty. You are not a gentleman. - You mean like the kind you read about in those stupid little books of yours. That's all bullshit. Wake up and smell the fucking coffee, will you. - Pull over, I gotta pee. - No, you can wait until we get to a gas station. - Troy, I need to go now. Can you just pull over somewhere, where no one can see? - Pain in the ass. (car engine roaring) Now don't you run away on me now. - I'm not gonna run away. (suspenseful music) (car door closes) - Hey woman, you're done squatting or what? - Just a second. (suspenseful music) White trash. - [Librarian] There you go. Hello. - Hi. - Oh, there's a fine of $11.25 on this book. - Yeah, I know. You guys usually send me out a late notice. I didn't get one this time. Do you think you can check to see if my address is listed correctly? - You're listed at 1973 Fox Hollow Road in Sun Valley. - Yeah, thanks. - Sure. (car engine roaring) - Don't worry, Ben, I'm coming. (suspenseful music) Oh, Ben, I'm sorry I'm late. - That's okay. Are you all right? You look kinda tired. - I've been shopping all day. Buckle up. Gotta hurry up and get you over and Kenny's. Don't wanna be late. - What do you mean my car is blocking your driveway. - [Man] Just what I said. - Where's my son-in-law. - [Man] I'll have this car towed, lady, if you don't. - No, no, no, no, don't have it towed. - [Man] Well get over here. - Give me your address, I'll get a cab, I'll be right there. - Damn that Troy, making me miss my hair appointment. (door knock) - Hi, what can I do you for? - I'm looking for Andrea McBride. - And what is this regarding? - Oh, I'm sorry, my name is Fawn Lewis. I just need to ask her some questions. My father hired a friend of hers as our nanny. - Really? And who is that? - Nikki Harcourt. - That's a new name on me. - I have a picture of her, maybe that would help. - I think I need my glasses to look at this. Why don't you come on in? - Great. - Don't mind the mess. I'm a sales rep for Nature's Kitchen. Do you use that antioxidants? - A little. - Well, you ask a doctor, he'll tell you, they are the key to a long and healthy life. - Well, my dad's a doctor, I'll ask him. - You don't say? What kind? - Neurosurgeon. - A brain doctor, huh. Well, he needs to be mentally alert in his job. Ginkgo biloba's perfect for him. What about your mother? - She died a year ago. - Oh honey, I'm so sorry. - [Fawn] Oh, no, it's okay. - And listen, if you're depressed, mugwort is. - I'm sorry, do you recognize her? - Sure wish I did know, but I don't. - Do you know where I can find Andrea? - All I know is she's staying with some friends for a couple of days, I'm not even sure which ones. (car horn honks) Oh, I gotta go. My keys. (suspenseful music) Come on, honey, we gotta get outta here. Cab's here. Sorry, I couldn't be more help. - [Fawn] That's okay. - Bye, bye. - Bye. (suspenseful music) Shit. Jen, hi, I'm going to be late for the party. I know, just tell everyone I'm going to be there, okay. - [Jen] Well don't be too long. - It's important. - Okay. - Great, thanks. - Bye. (suspenseful music) - Like the dress? It's new. - Well, I must say you look gorgeous. I got your message about Ben being at a overnight. I just wish you would have asked me. - I'm really sorry, I didn't think you would mind, honestly. He wanted to go so badly. - Well, I guess it's just the two of us, huh. - That's right. (taxi engine roaring) - Blood? What the hell has been going on here? (shower water running) (dog barks) - That's Nikki. - [Dr. Lewis] Hey. - So where are we going? - It's a surprise. (telephone rings) Wait a minute. Hello. - [Man] Hi, Dr. Lewis. - Yes. - [Man] Did you get my page? - No, I didn't get your page. Sure, sure, I'll be there in 10 minutes. It's an emergency at the hospital, one of my patients. So I'm, really very sorry but it could take some time. But I'll tell you what, why don't you change into something a little more casual and if I'm not back to late, we will order in. - I'll be here. - I'm sorry. - Well, it's just all part of being a doctor's wife. I mean, I'm just gonna have to learn to get used to it. - "Camarillo Psychiatric Hospital. "Andrea McBride. "Extended stay, 22 weeks. "Patient discharged." Oh my God. - [Dr. Lewis Voicemail] This is Dr. Lewis, leave a message. - Dad, it's Fawn. Call me back right away on my cell phone, as soon as you get this page, bye. - Andrea, wake up, wake up. - Mom. What are you doing here, mama? - Well, honey, Troy told me last night, where he found you. Then today I get this call, telling me that my car has been abandoned in the middle of town. So I go there, I find the car and I find blood in the car, but no Troy. - I swear, he never showed up here. - Sweetie, you can't kid a kidder. So what did you do with him? - I didn't do anything to him. Well, he was no good, anyway. Good riddance. - What do you want? - A girl named Fawn, visited me today. - What, what? - She asked about Andrea McBride. - Oh, my God. What did you tell her, mama? - I didn't tell her anything. I don't have to tell anybody anything, do I, Nikki? - Alright, you're getting at something, mama, just spit it out. - This is a wonderful house. - Yes. - It's just like one of those mansions, you always talked about from your storybook. - Please. - The man that owns this place must be very rich, indeed. A doctor, huh? - Yes. - I like this house. I like what you're doing with your life. - He's home already, mama, you've gotta get out of here. Now, now. - It's okay, it's okay, I'll let myself out of the back. Same way I came in. - Just go. - Hush girl, go take care of business. - Hello. - I didn't expect you so soon. - Hell, turns out our problem didn't require surgery and I am starved. Should we order some food? - Actually I made us something. - Boy, I owe you one big time, don't I? - Everything's ready to cook. - All right, if you'll excuse me, I'll go freshen up. - Okay. (suspenseful music) - Caught a glimpse of your fella, he's a handsome one. A lot better looking than old huckleberry, Troy. Looks like you're planning something, real nice for him tonight. - That is none of your business. Why aren't still here? - I just thought I would make sure that my with dimwit daughter didn't screw things up for both of us. - What do you mean? - The herbal market has its limits. And obviously Troy is not gonna be chipping in, his usual share. So I have to count on you. - I got cash in my purse, mama. (Rebecca laughs) - I don't think you understand. I mean on a regular basis. - What? - This is your fault. You lost my source of income and you have to replace it. - Get out of here, now. - No, no, not until we come to a suitable arrangement. Otherwise I'm going to have to tell the good doctor, what a fraud you are. - You wouldn't dare. - Oh, wouldn't I? I have nothing to lose, especially not you, you ungrateful little brat. It took me 10 years to get that weight off. You owe me. - Shut up, just shut up. I don't owe you anything. - Fine. Let's just see what the doctor has to say. - I hate you, I hate you, you always ruin everything. You are the reason that daddy left and I had to be your slave. Clean up after mama, Andrea, cook for mama, Andrea. Don't go to school Andrea because you don't fit in with the other kids. You know, I have something better for myself right now, mama and you are not gonna screw it up. - You're getting sick in the head again, Andrea. I'll bet they put you right back in that nuthouse, and this time for good. Yeah, that got her attention, didn't it? She ain't as dumb as she looks. (Rebecca laughs) Multiple vitamins. What the hell brand is this? I guess I should put Dr. Prince Charming on my mailing list. (Rebecca laughs) (dramatic music) - Burn in hell, mama. - Nikki, is everything all right? - Yeah, I just dropped something. - Oh, what's for dinner? (car engine roaring) Are you okay? You seem just a little nervous. - I'm always nervous on my birthday. - Well, Nikki, someday you are going to make some lucky guy, very happy. - Well, I would like to propose a toast. - Yes. - Thank you for being with me on my birthday. (suspenseful music) You are the most wonderful man. (suspenseful music) - No, no, no, no, no, Nikki, I can't do this. I can't do this. - I know you think I'm attractive. - Yes, I find you very attractive. - See, I knew it, I knew you liked me. - I like you as a person. - So you didn't wanna be with me tonight? - I wanted to make sure that you weren't alone on your birthday. I'm sorry if I misled you in any way. - What about all those things that you said to me? - What things? - All the things about how wonderful I am and how you couldn't do without me. - That doesn't mean I want to have a romantic relationship with you. Nikki. - You don't think I'm good enough. - I don't think that at all, no. - Do you have any idea what I've had to go through for you? Do you even know what I have done for you? - What are you talking about? - How could you be so selfish? How could you just use me like that and then not give me anything back? How dare you? - Nikki, come on, come on. It's obvious, you're very upset. - No, fuck you. Just treat little Nikki like shit and then just throw her away. Fuck you. - I'm gonna get you something to help you calm down. All right. - Don't you walk away from me. (dramatic music) Forgive me my love. (car engine roaring) - Dad. - I thought you were supposed to be out with your little college friends. - I had a conversation with your mother today, Andrea. - That's funny, so did I. - Dad. - He's around. In fact he and I are thinking about taking a trip, Big Bear or Mexico. - Cut the bullshit. - I've never been to Mexico. And you know what, Fawn, you're not invited. (dramatic music) I realize, James is a little confused right now. Once I get him alone, he's gonna realize how special his Nikki really is and then nobody is gonna get between us again. - No, no. (Fawn screams) (Dr. Lewis moans) - Damn. - Open the door. Open up. This is my room now. (dramatic music) You're not welcome here. (Andrea screams) - Stop. (dramatic music) - Nikki. Nikki don't. Hey. She's part of our family. - She tried to tear us apart. - No, no, no, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay. I won't let that happen. See, I realize now how much you mean to me. I mean deep in my heart. I have always known that you are the only one. I just didn't dare say it. Now, Fawn, Fawn will have to understand. (suspenseful music) There is no one in the world that I'd rather be with. Please, I need you. - James, you don't know how I've prayed for this to be true. - Oh, I do know. I do. And your wait is over. Please come into my arms, my love. Come. (Andrea cries) (gentle music) (birds chirping) - [Andrea] Our wedding will be the talk of all New England. - [Nurse] Andrea, it's time for your medication. - As I have told you before, my name is Mrs. Lewis. Why must I keep repeating myself? - You're right, Mrs. Lewis, I'm so sorry. - I would love some tea and butter cookies, please. - I'll see what the help can come up with. (door slams) (suspenseful music)
