4 p.m. at the library. Okay? ﻿Death to Premadasa ﻿I've been so worried. ...The leader of the Patriotic People's Movement has been arrested... ﻿Why are you putting that dried fish aside? ﻿That smell of burning tyres makes me want to vomit. ﻿is it Boxes' Muse? ﻿There was a time like that. ﻿When they ordered us not to leave home we stayed indoors. ﻿Those who stayed indoors were killed by nameless gunmen. ﻿They would announce curfews day after day. ﻿When they lifted the curfew people stepped out of their homes. ﻿Some never came back. ﻿On one of those days they came for me too. ﻿If he's done something wrong break his arm or leg ﻿but please send him home. ﻿I can look after him, sir. ﻿I've told you. Your son's not here. ﻿But sir, I've just heard my son call out “mother”. ﻿Cut it out and leave now. ﻿Please sir, let me see my child. ﻿Sir, let me see him just once. ﻿Hey, who let this woman in? ﻿Have you seen this child being brought into the hospital? ﻿No. ﻿Wait! ﻿Let's ask the guy in this room. ﻿My mother has been searching for me for six years. ﻿Identify the person now. ﻿You must touch the person to identify him. ﻿Are you absolutely sure? ﻿Yes. ﻿The witness points at the fifth person from the left ﻿in the identification parade ﻿and she identifies the suspect by touching him. ﻿Now this is the process. ﻿We'll schedule the hearing when the CID presents its brief of evidence. ﻿It will come to this court, then be heard in the upper court. ﻿The culprits can be punished only in the upper court. ﻿This will drag on for a while. Understand? ﻿Any news about my son, sir? ﻿Hopefully the defendant will reveal something to the CID. ﻿Can I ask that man? ﻿Are you out of your mind? ﻿That's a job for the police. ﻿You'll get into trouble. ﻿■EAwey ﻿would you get me file 93/512? ﻿Do you want to stay alive or be on a pyre of burning tyres? ﻿Who do you think you are? ﻿Something was wrong with his eyes. He kept twitching them like this... ﻿I was so hoping to hear some news today. ﻿They're trying to cover up everything. ﻿You've waited this long. Why not wait a bit longer, sister? ﻿Bring some bleaching powder. ﻿I'll see you all later. ﻿Shameless bastard. ﻿He acts as if nothing happened. ﻿There's nothing inauspicious until the 29th. ﻿Step away and wait for Grandma, child? ﻿Why can't I stay here, Grandma? ﻿When will she reach puberty, Reverend? ﻿In about five months. I've written it there. ﻿She won't go astray just because she lost her mother. ﻿She'll study hard and achieve a high position. ﻿Permission to leave, Reverend sir. ﻿I have my granddaughter's school uniforms. ﻿- Could you remove the stains from them? ﻿Reverend sir... ﻿I was wondering if I could get this horoscope checked. ﻿Whose horoscope? Your son's? ﻿Yes. ﻿Now that the court case has started, everyone keeps saying... ﻿Horoscopes for Che Guevara terrorists? ﻿Reverend, these shirts? ﻿Pass those shirts onto somebody. ﻿I heard you've identified someone at the court. ﻿Yes, Reverend. ﻿I wonder why they're taking soldiers to court when there's a war on. ﻿No room for that. - ﻿-	Just take me to the junction, please. - The next bus will be here soon. ﻿Let's go! ﻿I was wondering if there's any news. ﻿Haven't I told you I'd let you know if there's any news? ﻿Wasn't your son taken over five years ago? ﻿But sir, a boy from Matara returned home after seven years. ﻿Yes. Could you ring around 3 p.m? ﻿Would he reveal something while he's in prison, sir? ﻿He won't be jailed again. The Court of Appeal granted him bail. ﻿The CID will release him today. ﻿Weren't you listening to the magistrate? ﻿Does it mean the case is over? ﻿We won't let him go that easily. ﻿The CID took statements from him. I've asked them to report back. ﻿I'll send a telegram if there's any news. Okay? ﻿One of us was handed over to the police the day before yesterday. - ﻿-	There's one day left... - Who knows what will happen? ﻿We'll have to look into it. ﻿Where's my son? Tell me the truth. ﻿Where is he? ﻿He's alive. ﻿Where? Tell me where you're hiding him. ﻿He was sent to a rehabilitation camp. Go to the Commission. ﻿Rehabilitation? Where? ﻿Borella... Colombo 8. ﻿Why should you go through so much pain at this age? ﻿How on earth have you walked such distances? ﻿There should be a man at home, even if he is never there. ﻿Why would your own children make you suffer? - ﻿-	Let me read your palm, madam. - No need. ﻿No point searching, madam. ﻿You will find it only when you stop searching. ﻿Let me see your palm, madam. ﻿My Lord! ﻿You've never experienced joy in your life. ﻿Not even sweet dreams. Is that true? ﻿What do you have to say about my child? ﻿Your child doesn't have the same feelings you have for him. ﻿He will return to apologise. ﻿Return? When? ﻿Soon. Don't worry. ﻿He will kneel down before you to beg forgiveness. ﻿You must perform a special ritual for God Kataragama. ﻿Who's there? - ﻿- Can you speak English? - Yes. ﻿We don't have any English person. ﻿VJhat is b's name? - ﻿- What is his age? - 34. ﻿Can't you summon that man to this Commission, sir? ﻿This is a criminal case. We're not in a position to influence it. ﻿Fill in this form, please. ﻿You'll receive compensation of 25,000 rupees. ﻿It will be a cheque. ﻿Okay? ﻿\Ne issue death certificates for those who haven't returned within five years. Please S/9n, his'°™ and hand it in. ﻿We can mail you the death certificate. ﻿Okay? ﻿Samarappuli Henayalage Babanona. ﻿Compensation for the disappeared person. ﻿What the hell are you doing here? - ﻿-	Please listen to me, Aunty. - Why should I? ﻿Aunty, we should get the... ﻿Get out of here! I said get out. ﻿Feed a beggar with this. ﻿Aunty... ﻿A telegram for you. - ﻿-	Is it from the court? - Yes. ﻿The case is on the 17th. ﻿Is there any news about my son? ﻿They'll try every tactic to stop this case getting to the High Court. ﻿No matter how much they threaten you, don't back off until they're punished. ﻿Don't go too far. ﻿Yes, Counsel. ﻿Your Honour, this motion was filed today to inform Your Honour's court ﻿that the Criminal Investigation Division has compiled a brief of evidence. ﻿Your Honour, may I fix a date for the preliminary investigations? ﻿Your Honour... ﻿the suspect is a serving member of the Sri Lankan army. ﻿He is currently on bail. ﻿His wife is expecting their first child... - ﻿-	Counsel, are you ready to proceed? - Yes, Your Honour. - ﻿-	Don't drink too much. - I'm the one who's thirsty. ﻿We'll be late. ﻿You dropped this. - ﻿-	What's in these buns? - Fish. - ﻿-	This one? - Eggs. ﻿How many bodies are there? ﻿According to him between 150 and 200, sir. ﻿Do you mean one grave or several graves? ﻿About 20 graves according to him. ﻿Apparently they've used the area for two years. - ﻿-	You haven't identified the graves? - No, sir. ﻿He was granted bail just as we were about to. - ﻿-	Let's file a motion, then. - Okay, sir. - ﻿-	Don't let anyone know yet. - Very well, sir. ﻿A witness? ﻿Babanona... ﻿Wait. ﻿Sir? ﻿We're going to Kadurugaha Waththa. You can come if you like. ﻿Now? ﻿Yes, we might find a clue. ﻿We're unearthing necklaces, clothes and other things. ﻿Sister... ﻿We'll drop you home before dark. ﻿Doctor... ﻿t* paliha'"at)ana' ﻿This is the mother of the victim. - ﻿-	Mother, sit here. - No need, sir. ﻿Please sit here. ﻿You must gather some strength now. ﻿Listen to me carefully and answer my questions. ﻿Do you remember what your son was wearing? ﻿Only a sarong. ﻿I have a piece of the cloth they used to blindfold him. ﻿We have a piece of that cloth. ﻿Listen to me now. I'm asking about the sarong. ﻿It had orange coloured stripes. ﻿Stripes We ﻿When my son came to me in my dreams ﻿and said he was somewhere, suffering, ﻿I didn't understand. ﻿I understand your grief. ﻿Grandma... ﻿Come in. ﻿I heard about your problems. I didn't want to bother you. ﻿Daughter? ﻿Return this before the school holiday ends. ﻿Don't you get sore fingers when you wash a big load? ﻿I'm used to it now, Miss. ﻿Such a pleasant child, just like her mother. ﻿Had she not run for that election she'd still be alive. ﻿And the child in her womb would've been five years old. ﻿Those rogues are begging for votes as if nothing ever happened. ﻿- Already finished? - I tasted fish. ﻿I made them for the tea shops. Are you still a vegetarian? ﻿Wait a moment. ﻿Will you come to the meeting? ﻿We must get at least one of our men into local council. ﻿My son would also distribute flyers at election time. ﻿Times are different, Aunty. ﻿I started to realise by then that he'd joined the movement. ﻿I knew he was up to something really dangerous ﻿with that tutor. ﻿Aunty, I don't think it will rain. ﻿I'm not sure. ﻿I thought, why should I meddle in their business? ﻿After all, they were more educated. ﻿We're from the Patriotic People's Movement. ﻿Mother, father, brother, sister... do you see both sides of the road? ﻿This despotic government is killing innocent young people, ﻿leaving their disfigured bodies on every corner. ﻿It's breaking this country into pieces... ﻿They'll hand part of it over to India... ﻿Mother, father, brother, sister, we urge you to boycott the election. ﻿Stop the bus! ﻿What's wrong? ﻿Move on. Go! ﻿That was a time when you couldn't caution your own child. ﻿Is it a crime to hand out flyers, Aunty? ﻿What about the criminals roaming free? ﻿Why don't you take those clothes today? ﻿You must wear something decent for those meetings. ﻿What about these shoes? ﻿704, non-summary. ﻿Defendant, enter the dock. Lionel Yakupitiya. ﻿Witnesses, come forward... - ﻿-	Ready for the trial, Your Honour. - Yes, Your Honour. ﻿First witness, Sergeant Gammanpila, enter the witness box. ﻿Other witnesses, leave the court. Wait outside. ﻿Stay here. ﻿It will be a while before you testify but you must be here. ﻿- Eat something and come back at 1.30. - ﻿-	Have you brought something? - I'm not hungry, sir. ﻿You do laundry for a living, don't you? ﻿Some people are buying washing machines these days. ﻿I prefer hand washing to machines. ﻿Where are you going? ﻿He has an illness. ﻿He can't stay in one place. ﻿They deserve to rot alive with bedsores... ﻿and be eaten by maggots. ﻿I knelt down at your man's feet, ﻿begging him not to take my child away. ﻿They battered him, broke his bones and pulled out his toenails. ﻿I was told that they buried him alive. ﻿There will be a reckoning in this life and the lives to come. ﻿Even their children, born and unborn, will be cursed. ﻿This creature's mother was run over by a car. ﻿Awful karma! ﻿What's he doing here? - ﻿-	Where is it? - What? ﻿Aunty... ﻿What are you talking about? ﻿There's nothing here. ﻿Go away! ﻿I didn't recognise you. - ﻿-	Come in. - No, I must go back to work. ﻿I left work without permission. ﻿The police brought a man to the hospital yesterday. ﻿He looks just like your son... ﻿The one in the photo you showed me. ﻿My son? ﻿Yes, but he has some mental issues. ﻿The doctor's trying to send him to the asylum ﻿but I begged him to keep the boy just one more day. ﻿You must come and see him. ﻿See you then. ﻿Son... ﻿-Tate a W', er'°Ok' ﻿\Ne must have sinned a lot to see and hear these awful things... ﻿to suffer seeing them again and again. ﻿He was your only son, wasn't he? ﻿You don't have anyone to look after you later on. ﻿This is my only child. ﻿But there were five in my husband's family. ﻿Four of them were in the army. ﻿Tiger terrorists killed two of them. ﻿Aunty, can't you give up this case? ﻿™S won't bring your son teck ﻿They've taken all his medals away because of this case. ﻿His bosses made him do all the dirty work ﻿while they got promoted to higher positions. ﻿He was on medical leave. ﻿You don't notice, but he's a sick man. ﻿He wakes up in the night screaming from the nightmares. ﻿He wets the bed almost every night. ﻿Aunty, he is living in hell. ﻿Take a seat. ﻿No, I'm fine here, Miss. ﻿Shall I bring your chair? ﻿No, Miss. ﻿Did you know my mother? ﻿I performed the ceremony for your mother too. ﻿The j\/P shot my mother. ﻿I know, Miss. ﻿Do you remember that day? ﻿I remember that day very well, Miss. ﻿My son had a high fever that day. ﻿That's why I remember that day so well. ﻿I rubbed his forehead with a vinegar patch and gave him Panadol ﻿but he whimpered with fever the whole night. ﻿Give this to her. ﻿You're giving evidence today. ﻿Sir... - ﻿- Is everything okay? - I must talk to you. ﻿Just repeat what you told the police. Don't worry about anything. ﻿What is your name? ﻿Samarappuli Henayalage Babanona. ﻿Your husband? ﻿He's no longer alive. ﻿Your son? ﻿K k. Kamal Sbanlha. ﻿You lodged a complaint with the police about your son's abduction. ﻿When did this occur'? ﻿November 7,1989. ﻿What happened that day? ﻿About 8 o'clock at night I served dinner for my son. ﻿Then when I was about to serve myself... ﻿I heard the noise of a vehicle screeching to a halt. ﻿They had come for my son. ﻿My son ran out the back door but he got caught. ﻿And then? ﻿I heard yelling in the darkness “Catch him! Catch him!” ﻿One of them tore a sheet to blindfold my son. ﻿Did you recognise these men? ﻿Their faces were covered. ﻿But you recognised one of them. ﻿I found it hard to recognise them in the dark. ﻿You identified the defendant in an identification parade. ﻿Objection, Your Honour. ﻿You identified a person... ﻿Yes. ﻿Who was that? Tell the truth. ﻿I identified the man in the dock. ﻿But now I'm not sure whether he's the same person. ﻿I couldn't recognise them in the dark. ﻿I can't recall. ﻿Why are you scared to give evidence? ﻿I'm not scared. ﻿What, then? ﻿I don't want this case to go on. ﻿You don't? You're only saying it now? ﻿Do you know how hard I worked to bring it this far? ﻿Not one day off! I worked for weeks to find those graves. ﻿When the police were absconding I chased after them ﻿to collect all the evidence. ﻿I'll plead with the magistrate to let you testify again. ﻿No need, sir. ﻿Get out«'here' then. ﻿Please listen. ﻿Go back into the witness box. Say you identify that man. ﻿I won't ask anything else of you. ﻿You can do it, can't you? ﻿Aunty, you've betrayed your own son. ﻿He sacrificed his life for all of us. ﻿Did you know? ﻿They tortured him... ﻿but he never uttered a word. ﻿Only you could have punished them on behalf of all of us. ﻿My son comes to me in my dreams and says that he's floating, ﻿somewhere in the darkness, he's suffering in so much pain. ﻿If you're listening to me now, my son, ﻿you must know that I've forgiven the criminals. ﻿You must now get out of that ghostly existence ﻿and find a life in the womb of a blessed mother. ﻿My God! What is this? ﻿I went to your place but someone said we'd find you here. ﻿Why would you bring all this? ﻿You can stay in the taxi. ﻿He isn't here, he got out on the way. ﻿You must go too. You can't keep this child in the sun. ﻿There's no hurry, Aunty. I don't know when I can come back. ﻿A girl. ﻿Say hello to Grandma. ﻿This is the angel who rescued your father. ﻿Say thank you. ﻿I heard that they dropped the case. ﻿I felt bad about living overseas. ﻿I was always worried something might happen to you. ﻿What could happen to me? ﻿You know about the weapon. ﻿I saw you burying it... ﻿on the day my son had a high fever... ﻿on the day Madam Rupawathi was killed. ﻿Was Madam Rupavathi killed by that gun? ﻿Who shot her? ﻿Tell me the truth. Who? ﻿I had news the land would be subdivided and sold. ﻿How could that happen? ﻿Would my own child do something like that? ﻿I must remove it tonight. ﻿It's not there any more. ﻿Not there? ﻿Sir, give me back my son. ﻿Give me back my son. ﻿On the night they took me away my mother concealed it in the mud. ﻿It must have rusted and decayed by now. -:- OCR by Sh!kZ -:-
