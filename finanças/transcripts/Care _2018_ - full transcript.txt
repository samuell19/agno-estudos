This programme contains some strong language. ..Five, six, pick up sticks. Seven, eight, run to the gate. Nine, ten, a big fat hen! In you get. Come on, let's go. Who wants fish and chips? - Me! OK, so it's fish and chips for four, and are you going to have mushy peas or not? No. No. Eh? You've got to have mushy peas. No... Fish and chips aren't fish and chips without mushy peas. £1.60 chips, £2.80 fish. How much together? 4.40? Correct. So, fish and chips for four, Sophie, please? I don't know. Looking forward to eating them? Yes. Then I strongly advise you to attempt an answer, since not to do so could result in a crushing disappointment. £17.60. Thank you. Hiya, Mum. Oh, we'll be there in five minutes. Warm the plates. Why? We've got fish and chips. I told them no burgers and no chips. It was my idea. No, it wasn't. It was Sophie's idea, because she can twist you round her bloody little finger. Aw, they've been good. Well, I don't care. They've had chips twice this week already. They're going to start looking like bloody chips. Put her on a sec. You've got me into trouble. Sorry. Hi, Mum. What did I tell you? Grandma wanted them. No, she didn't. Honest, Mum, she did. We wanted pizza. I told her you'd go mad. We wanted pizza, Mum! Grandma? Grandma! Gran! Grandma! Sophie, what's wrong? Grandma! Come on, wake up. We're going to crash. Hello? Sophie? Sophie? Sophie! Hello? Hello? Hello! Can anybody hear me? Please pick the phone up. Hello? Mum! Excuse me. Sorry. Mum! Oh, God, Mum. Where's the kids? Where are my kids?! Blue Volvo. Girls! Oh, my God! Mum! Come here. Oh... No, the kids are fine but they've taken them in to check them over, so you need to pick them up, OK? Where are they taking them? The children's, and they're starving, so you're going to need to feed them. They're taking me mam to the Royal, so I'm just following them now. Can you phone our Claire and just tell her what's happened, please? What? Can't you? Yeah, I could, but I'm driving, you selfish bastard. I'm really stressing. Do you think I've lost weight? A bit, yeah. I wanted to lose a stone but failed abysmally, so I'm making sure I get fat bridesmaids. Oh, really? This is a message for Claire. But my dad's being awkward. Sorry, do you mind if I get that? Jenny's on the way to the hospital. I have to pick up the kids. Hello? Yeah, it's me. Your mum, she's been in a car crash. Is it bad? Yeah. Which hospital? The Royal. Jenny's gone with her. I'll be there as soon as I can. Thanks. I'm... I'm sorry, I've got to go. My mum's crashed her car. Mum? Mum? Are you OK? No... Isn't there some rule, some limit as to how long we can wait? Four hours? A target, sir. I'm well over that. I know what's going on here. I'm over the limit, I'm already a blot on your statistics, so you might as well keep me waiting... Excuse me. It will have no effect on your numbers... Nothing of the sort, sir. I promise you... Excuse me... No, excuse me, please, love! Now, what's going on? If you just take a seat, we'll be with you as soon as we can. Take a seat. Always, take a seat. Sorry about that. It's OK. I'm looking for Mary Taylor. She's my mum. She had a car crash. She was brought in earlier. Hiya, Mum. Mum? George? It's Claire, Mum. She doesn't know me either. What's she doing here? We're just waiting for a scan, but there's loads in front of us. George? Dad's dead, Mum. I wanted flowers to wake up the candle drums. Well, we can get you some flowers, Mum. How long have you been here? Two hours. I wanted flowers to wake up the candle drums. Oh, for God's sake! No, Claire, don't piss them off. I wanted flowers to wake up the candle drums. Come on, it's all right. Oh, shit. Hiya, mate. I'm so sorry, but I've got no money. My kids were in a crash. I was on the phone to them when it happened and I just ran out the house with nothing. I'm so sorry. Then you can't get out, love. Well, what am I supposed to do? I won't be long. Do you want to come in? No. Kids, your mum's here! What did you give them? Cheesy chips. Jesus. What? Nothing. How is she? Not good. If there's anything I can... Money-wise? Look, I came out without my keys. The house. Oh, well, I'll get mine. Kids. Bye, Cheryl. Bye, Cheryl. Mum! Hi. Hi, darling. Mum! Bye, Dad. All right, girls. Come on. Go wait in the taxi. I'll race you. Thanks. I'll post them back through your letterbox. Right. Just here on the left. Yeah, just here. Come on, girls. Out you get. Cheers, mate. I won't be a sec, all right? Thank you. Go on. Come on, girls. Straight up to bed, please. Night-night. Night-night. Love you. Love you too. Shit. Agh! Take 18, please. Thank you. Hi, Pete. It's Jenny Northwood here. Look, you're probably manning my till, but I won't be in for a while, I'm afraid. My mum's sick, and there's no-one to sort the kids out. All right, girls? Bye, Mummy. Mwah. Bye, Mummy. Have a good day, all right? Love you! She's sitting up. She's sitting up! Mary? Yeah. She insisted. Hi, Mum. Hi, it's me. It's Jenny. Hotchpotch. Hotchpotch. Excuse me, sorry... Yes? I don't know what she's trying to say. Hotchpotch! It's the toilet, isn't it, Mary? Could you just wait at the entrance while we...? Claire? Hi. You're not answering your phone. It's flat. Your landline. There's a fault on the landline, I think. What is it you wanted? I did want you to pick the girls from school, but I can get them now. Right. Not tomorrow, though. I can't. You can't pick them up in the afternoon? No. Well, then, take them in the morning? I can't do that either. You've got to start pulling your weight, Dave, otherwise I'm going to lose my job. I can't, I'm sorry. For God's sake. She's going to start work soon. Cheryl? Yeah, you know, and when she does then I'll be able to help out a lot more. More regular too. What? What? George? Mam, Dad's dead. So, up to this stroke, she was living independently? Yes. He died years ago. Her dementia was manageable? She doesn't have dementia. How much do these things cost? You mean it wasn't diagnosed? No, I mean there was absolutely nothing wrong with her. She's been minding my kids, and I wouldn't let a demented woman to that. George... George... It's not Dad, Mam. Sorry. Sorry, my mum's a bit confused. Don't worry about it. Why a bottle full of ice? Mam, Mam, sit down. George! Sit down, Mam. No... What type of house is it? A terraced. Does she own it? No. Is that a problem? No. Steps might be. Are there any? Two? Three. You bought me that. So we could be looking at a ramp. You're thinking of sending her home? Well, she's been here three weeks already. It's difficult to see what else we can do for her. Can I just stop you there? Right? My mum has had a stroke. Yes. And she's making no sense. She's convinced anything that moves is her dead husband and right now, she's trying to eat metal. Mam, no, no, no. So there's obviously brain-damage, yes? Yes. So shouldn't we be trying to fix that? Yes, but this is an assessment ward, Claire. We are not staffed for rehabilitation. Then can we go somewhere that is? There are no places available. And even if there were, they are designed to get people back on their feet, and Mary is already walking. Yeah, but she's no idea where she's walking to. I know. Look, I think we'll talk again after the kitchen test. What's the kitchen test? Occupational Therapy need to know that Mary can find her way around the kitchen and make herself a cup of tea. Are you serious? Yes. You can sit in if you like? Oh, I'd love to. What am I doing, Mary, hmm? I'm filling the kettle, aren't I? Would you like to do it? If you show me you can do it, you can go home. Would you like that? Never mind, eh? So... ...what do we do next? Come on, Mam, what do you do next? We do ask families not to prompt. Sorry. Or intervene in any way during these tests. You see, our aim is to prove to Mary that she can carry out these tasks without any help whatsoever. Right. Right, now there's water in the kettle. Mary? We plug it in here and we turn it on... just here. Now, can you do that for me, Mary? Shall I show you? OK. Now your turn. Well, never mind, eh? I'll tell you what. How about I make one first and then you can have a go? So... ...what do we need? Well, we need a tea bag and a cup. Look over here, Mary. There's a lovely one. Roses. Now, I bet you love growing roses, don't you? Now, here's a cup, and here's the tea bag. Can you help me, Mary? Can you put the tea bag into the cup? No, no... No, Mam. Mam, Mam. Mary... No, spit it out. Spit it out, please. Spit it out, Mam. No, no, no. It's OK. It's OK. You tried your best. It's OK, Mary. Home. We're going to another hospital, Mam, where you can get better. Home. Soon. Soon. You must be Mary. I'm Josh, Mary. Jenny. Hi. We'll soon have her dancing again. Won't we, Mary, hey? Just say what is, Mam. Tell me what it is! It's all right. It's all right. There is one thing. Yeah. They've stopped saving for their holiday. Yeah, they won't be able to go. That's a shame. Yeah. May I... May I ask why? Erm, well, I've lost my job and tax credit. We'll refund what you have paid. I thought that wasn't possible? It is in this case. Thank you. Stop! Stop laughing, I had it first. Give it back. Give it back. I had it first. No! Stop... What's happened? Sorry, I've tried but she's taken against me. Sausage. You're not my friend today, are you, Mary? Sausage! Do you want to wait outside? It's all right, it's OK. Just wait there. On the cake again? Yeah. She's been having more stomach problems, and I'm wondering, should I go and ask the doctor to see her again? You be all right? Yeah. Yeah. Hey, Mam. Why don't you have a little seat, hey? Hmm? Have a little sit down, hey? There you go. Careful. Have you got a pain, Mam? Yeah? Where? Where is it, Mam? There you go, let's have this, look. When the medicine kicks in, I'll bring the girls in. That'll be nice, won't it? Come in. It's OK. Grandma's Grandma again now. Promise. Good girls, come on. Give grandma a hug. Give her your letters. Good girls. Letters for Grandma. It's all right. I folded my garden gates. I folded my garden gates. It's OK. Good girls. I folded my garden gates. Oh. Hiya. Hi. I'm Amanda Jennings, and this is Diane, Mary's social worker, who will also be helping you with the discharge. Now, do you have power of attorney? No, Mum's not fit to give it to us, so we're going for Court of Protection. Right. Diane, if you could go and get the team, and bring Mrs Taylor in, please. You're bringing Mum in? Yes. Won't she get upset? It's the patient's right to attend and play an active part in the discharge procedure. Diane and I will answer any questions that you may have at the end of the meeting. So, Dr O'Sullivan, if you can bring us up to date and then we can let you go. Mary Taylor had an acute stroke which has affected her vision, right upper limb and cognitive ability. She was referred here for rehabilitation. Don't shine for it. Don't shine for it. Since arriving, she's developed additional medical problems... Don't shine for it! ..Nausea, vomiting and acute constipation. She has been referred to a consultant gastroenterologist. She has been given antibiotics and steroids while she waits to see him. Once seen, she'll be followed up after discharge as an outpatient. There's nowhere. Thank you, Doctor. Could I ask why she's on a drip? Because he's dehydrated, owing to her difficulty swallowing. Nowhere on my face... Doctor's very busy today, so can we move on to you, Hilary, and physiotherapy? Yeah, thank you, Doctor. When Mary arrived, we focused on treatment to make the muscles aware, however since the health problems we've been unable to carry on. This morning, we tested Mary. You climb into my water, so get me out of there. When given objects, she couldn't match them. A sock with a sock, a picture card with a word card. You climb into my water, so get me out of there. I don't understand what you are saying, Mam. We still see involving Mary as an active goal. Plunder. Plunder. So far there's been no progress. Fetch me a bone. We think this is more cognitive than physical, and there's not much more we can do on that front. I have a note from Speech Therapy saying they've have to discontinue due to lack of cooperation. I just... I know how hard this is for everyone but we are nearly there. Nurse Brown. Mary is often very confused... She is uncooperative, at times aggressive. She only sleeps for short periods and is often found wandering, disturbing other patients. Due to falls, her mattress is now on the floor. She has assaulted three nurses and a cleaner. We are trying... I've had enough of this. I understand this is upsetting everyone. No, it's ridiculous. I promise you, carry on, it'll all be over in a matter of minutes. I've seen enough. Come on, we're going home, Mam. We're going home. Just listen to her, right? I've got to go and get the kids. Five minutes. I'm not here to talk you into anything, Jenny. You've removed your mother from the hospital, and that suits us all. We can all wash our hands of her, but there's things you should know, OK? You've got to childproof your kitchen, otherwise she is guaranteed to scald herself and very, very likely to burn the house down. You need a secure gate at the top up the stairs or you're going to find her in a heap at the bottom. You need handrails on the bath and toilet, or she's going to crack her head open on the tiles. And a dozen other things I could mention, but that will do for now. I haven't got any money. We'll pay. It's cheaper than keeping her in hospital. But you can't look after a demented mother and two kids while there's building work going on around you. So, what do I do? Put her into care. No. Just while the builders are in, that's all. No! Look, I know you think I've got a cheek, but she's my mother too. Hello. Hello. You must be Mary. Mary, I'm Helen. Hi, I'm Jenny. Hi. Welcome to Belle Vista, Mary. I'm the one you come to if you've any problems. And I'm the one who's going to be showing you round today, OK? This is the lounge. You'll probably spend most of your time here, Mary, most people do. There's a concert once a week if you're well enough. Visitors are welcome. Give me five minutes, love, I won't be long. And last but not least, your bedroom. Thank you. I'll leave you to it. It's just for a bit, Mam. It's just while I get the house ready for you. Hi. Hiya. How did it go? Um... Jenny? On the pack ice, the polar bears are hunting seals. Their activity attracts attention. When a meal is found, it's all fours to the pump as the mother encourages her cubs to feast. Once down to the bone, she frantically digs around in the snow for scraps... Hello. Hi, is that Jenny Northwood? Yes, speaking. This is the nursing home. Your mother's gone missing. Missing? Yeah. You mean she's somewhere in the building? Not exactly. She's nowhere in the building. Oh, God. I'll come in. No, it would be better if you stay... No, I'm coming! Hiya. Dave? Dave, it's me. Look, my mum has gone missing in that bloody nursing home. I don't know, but I just need you to come over here, OK. Why? Because I'm going to go over there, that's why! Hello? Hello? Shit, I've been drinking. Jenny, isn't it? Yeah. The best thing you can do, Jenny, is wait at home by the phone. My husband's doing that, I want to see her room, please. We've searched her room, she's not there. I want to know what she's wearing. All right. Yeah... Come on. Her coat's here. Yeah. Her dressing gown isn't. My mother is walking around the city in a dressing gown and nightie! Mam! Mam! Mam? Cheers. Cheers. Claire, look it's me. I'm at Mam's, she's gone missing, and there's no sign of her here. Can you phone me when you get this? Not find her? Police are still looking. The place is a dump. I mean that place, Belle Vista. Look, do you want a cup of tea? No, I'll do it. No, no, no. I'll do it. Sophie... Sophie said she saw you and Cheryl? Yeah. In St Margaret's Street. She said she saw you coming out of Mother And Child. Yeah. Is she pregnant? Yeah. When's it due? Four months gone. Do you know what it is? Yeah. Boy. You... I thought she was getting a job? As soon as you got a job, you were going to be able to cough up some money to pay for the kids that you left me with, yeah? Yeah. Well, that's not going to happen now, is it, if she's pregnant? No. Hello. Hiya. Sorry, I only just got your message. Have you found her? No. The police are looking. Have you heard from her? The police are out searching. Right, I'm coming up. Don't come up, Claire. Why not? I should be there. I'll phone you if I hear anything, in case they're trying to phone me. Bye. Look, I'm going to be looking after Mam from now on, so I'll get a Carer's Allowance but you need to find some money from somewhere. I don't see why my kids should suffer just because she's gone and got herself... I will, I will. When? As soon as. No, no, no. The police. How did you know to bring her here? Two letters from two grandkids. Come in. Goodnight now, Mary. Goodnight. It was recharging on the worktop. I haven't moved it, and Sophie hasn't because she's been searching high and low for it, so that leaves you. Where is it? I don't know. You're lying. I'm not. Have you brushed your teeth this morning? Yeah. Breathe. Right, get up those stairs now and clean your teeth. Ooh! You are a ten-year-old girl, for God's sake. I shouldn't need to tell you when you have to brush your teeth. Come on, we are late. Hurry up, come on. Oh, I'm sorry. I feel ashamed. You should, come on, just do it. Well, wet the toothbrush first. Yeah! Sophie? Sophie? What? Just keep an eye on Grandma and tell me if she gets off that chair, all right? Yeah. You don't put toothpaste on a dry brush, for God's sake. What good will that do? Won't be a minute, Mam. Love you. Love you too. Bye, Mummy. Bye. Mam, sorry, sorry, sorry. It's OK. Sorry. I won't do that again, I promise. Come on, come on. Mam, come on. Can I help? No! Thanks. Come on. Come on, please. That's it. You're all right. Can I talk to you? Please? Careful, Mam. Do you want a tea? Yes, please. How do you take it? White, no sugar. They said you wouldn't be long, so I waited. Chocolate, Mam? Keeps you out of mischief, doesn't it, chocolate? Excuse me. Nick, I'm making tea if you want one. Yes, please. I never should have started that, but I did, and now I'm making tea even if I don't want one, just in case he does. Bit of a pushover like that, I guess. How did she get out? I don't know. There was a woman standing in a pool of her own urine. Yes. How long had she been like that? I don't know that either. She was in a pool of urine because we'd run out of incontinence pads. We always do. We get the cheaper ones, the less absorbent ones, but even them we can barely afford. There were three of us on last night. 30 residents, some with severe dementia, and just three staff. I've known just one of those residents need the three of us to sort her out, which meant 29 people wandering around, unsupervised. Nevertheless, just the three of us. Can't blame the boss either, the owner. Our place makes him 20 grand a year. Put an extra member of staff on and that 20 grand has gone and the place closes down. Everyone knows this... ...local authority, the NHS, CQC. They know the standard of care in places like ours isn't good enough. But better substandard care than no care at all. So everybody keeps shtum. Meanwhile, people like us - me, Rachel, Roz, the three who were on last night - totally dedicated. As caring and compassionate as anyone could be. We battle on. Look at the beautiful bracelet, isn't it? I've not got a chair. Look, if you get lost again, they'll see the address on here and they'll bring you back home. I've not got a chair. Mam, I worry about you, but if you have this on I will worry a little bit less. I've not got a chair. I don't know what you are saying, Mam. Hiya. Hi. Hiya. Erm, I've finished. Right. Thanks for all the tea. You're welcome. Erm, if anything goes wrong, at all, my number is on there. Great. Thanks. I was wondering... ...if you fancied going for a drink some time? I... I couldn't. Why not? My mam. Couldn't your sister...? No, she couldn't cope. You have to. Yeah, well, our Claire couldn't, I'm sorry. I'm made up to be asked, but no. I really couldn't. OK. Bye. Bye, Mary. Oh, shit. Lauren, are you sure you haven't had them? No. Sophie? No. Mam, are you sure you've not seen the keys? Look, they're not where they usually are and the kids haven't had them and neither have I, so you must have them. I need to check your pockets. Can I just have a look in your pocket, please? Mum, we're late, I need... For God's sake, Mam. You mustn't touch these ever again, all right? Come on, kids. We're late. Got your bags? Quick, quick, quick. Got your bags? Good girl. Bye, Mum. Bye, darling. Love you. Oh, God. Mum, no. Mum, come on. Come on! Get back in the car, please. No, no. Come on. No, no. Ow! It's OK, it's OK. Sh, it's OK, it's OK. It's OK. Get back in the car. There we go. It's OK, it's OK. Mum. OK, stay in there. Fine by me. I promise you. Careful. Don't touch these again, Mam, OK? Please. Do you want a cup of tea? Thank you. Hiya, kids. Hi! Hi, Mam. Claire is going to look after you for a while, while we go out, OK? It's just for a bit, OK? Kids, come on, let's go. Are you taking the girls? Yeah. Where? Dave's. Come on. Bye, Grandma! Bye, Grandma! In you get. Anything in to drink? No. Watch the road, please. Careful. Be good, OK? Hey, hello. Hi, Dad. Bye, Mum, love you. Bye, love you too. What's with the bags? They've got school tomorrow. What? They are sleeping over? Yeah. You didn't say that. Yeah, I did. No, you didn't. You said you were going for a drink with a mate. Well, I am. And I'll be late. I'm not going to be dragging them home at all hours of the night when they've got school in the morning. You look good. Thank you. It's a male friend, I take it? Yeah, Dave, it is. And you know what? He's going to fuck my brains out all night. There we are. One wine and soda. Ta. Slainte. So have you got any brothers and sisters? Aye, six. Six? It was the quick and the thin in our house, I'm telling you. My mum, right, used to do a Sunday tea, you know, butties and sausage rolls and cakes and all that stuff. And my brother, Tam, he'd go like this... He would pick up a load of stuff in his right hand and then he'd stash it under the table in his left hand. And he would keep eating with the right hand. And when everything was gone and the table was empty, he would just resort to what was in his left hand. Greedy bastard. Twice the size of me. Still is. What about you? It's just me and our Claire. And she's got no kids. Is that out of choice? Um, I don't know. I don't know, we don't really go there. I knew there was something wrong. I didn't know he was carrying on, but I knew something wasn't right. So I said, "Why don't we try for a boy?" Thinking that would sort it. But that's what he'd always wanted, you see, deep down. Anyway, he just said, "No, I'm happy with just the girls "and nothing was wrong." But now she's pregnant. This other woman is pregnant, and, of course, it's a boy. So, yeah, that hurts a bit. Anyway... Why, thank you. Goodnight. Evening. Madison Street first, please, mate. Off Chambers, yeah. And then I'm going on to Wardsworth Street, thanks. In your own time, mate. Do you want to come back for a coffee? What about your mum? She'll be asleep. Your sister? She'll give you the once over and then leave. Eyes wide if she approves and mouth like this if she doesn't. I tell you what, mate, we're both getting off at Madison. Just up here on the right. Oh, my God, what's happened? Oh, God. Are you Jenny Northwood? Yeah. And this lady? Yeah, it's my mam. What's happened? Hiya. How's things? Fine. Yeah, how's Mam? Fine, everything is fine. You just go and enjoy yourself. I'm at home, Claire, with Mam. I'm sorry, Jenny, I'm really sorry. They wouldn't even know what to do with her, only she was wearing the bracelet that I got her. I said, "How lucky was that?" Sorry. It's OK. I had to go to Jenny's last night and... ...I didn't get back until late, I'm really sorry. It's OK, it's fine. Claire, love, I have been meaning to ask you this, anyway. Do you need some time off to be with your mum a bit more? What? I can sort that for you if you want. No, I'm fine, thanks. Are you sure? Positive. Mam! Mam! Mam! Daddy! Hey, you all right? How is she? No news yet. I wondered whose it was. What? The broomstick outside. Oh, have they eaten? No, and no cheesy chips again, please. What about a fish supper? Yeah! You can afford that, can you? Just about, yeah. Right, come on, girls. Let's leave Auntie Claire to her cackling. This way. Bye, girls. BOTH: Bye, Mummy! Now, you have already got a care package settled for Mary and they will keep that open for as long as they possibly can. Sadly, the longer she stays here, the more her care package is threatened, so it is in all of our best interests to get Mary home again as soon as possible. Now, the scan does show... Sorry, you're hurdling ahead here. Am I? Yes. We've not seen our mother yet, nor any doctor who treated her, nor any nurse who cared for her, but you're already throwing her out. I'm throwing nobody out, I assure you. What is your title again? Claire. Discharge liaison officer. It used to be you'd come into hospital and leave when you got better. You can't do that any more. Not enough beds, not enough money. So you are here doing a job that shouldn't even exist. I'm here to help this unit run as efficiently as possible. Would you like to see your mother now? It doesn't help, you know? Having a go at them. What, do you think if we were nice to her, she would be nice to Mum? No, she sees niceness as weakness. Hi, hiya. Ow! Stop! Stop! Stop! Sh, sh. Has she hit you before? Well... I was struggling with her in the car once, she caught me on the nose. But I think that was an accident. That is the first time she's done it and meant it. Why do you think she did it? Because she's back in the hospital, she hates it there. We'll find her somewhere else. We did. She went missing five minutes later. You're thinking of bringing her back here, aren't you? Hi, sorry I'm not at home, leave a message and I'll get back to you. Um, about that coffee... I wondered if we could, you know, maybe try again some time? Coffee? Look, you tried having her back here and you failed. But you got a lucky break. A lucky break? Yes. I'm sorry to be brutal, but, yes, a lucky break. And she's back in there now and she is their responsibility and not yours. They will do it so much better than you ever will, because that's what they are trained for. Tell me you won't bring her back here. Why do you want to do it, anyway? Half the time she doesn't even recognise you. You're doing it because she's your mother and you've got to be seen to be looking after your mother. It's out of guilt and fear of what the neighbours will say. Her life's over, Jenny, don't let her ruin yours. Do you know what? I do feel guilty, yeah. But what about you, Claire? Better to lock me mother up in a home than see me sister running around like a blue-arsed fly making me feel so guilty cos I do fuck all. Hi. Say something. I'm sorry. Do you know the best thing a mother can do for her children? Die. You are so wrong. Oh, thank you. There we are. Oh, look, please say you'll have her. I don't know how long she's got left, you know, and I just don't want to spend it being worried sick about her, I just want her to be comfortable. Well, we've got what she needs. Round-the-clock nursing care, doctor on duty or on call 24 hours a day, and a good staff to patient ratio. Of course we'll have her. Thank you. But it is 700 a week. You'd have to fund that from the sale of your mother's house. She doesn't own her house, you see. Well, it's a council house and she wouldn't pay it on principle. Does she have any other assets? No. Then the council would put 400 towards it. And the rest? Well, you'd have to find that. I wish you hadn't shown me around now. You've tried for NHS Continuing Healthcare? What? Hiya, Jen. What? And we can do that? Hello, I'm Rebecca Compton, I'm head of the stroke unit here. You are? Jenny. And you must be Claire. Yes. Sorry it's taken until now to meet, but I have been on secondment. You know Amanda? Yes, we've had the pleasure. Right, how's it going? Well, we've seen two nursing homes that are suitable and two that aren't. And the two that are, we can't afford. People do find that they need to lower their sights a bit. We have done. Often it's just appearances. The standard of care no different. Take Belle Vista, for instance. It looks a bit basic, but it is good. We've put my mum in Belle Vista. They lost her the same day. Well, we're not trying to put you under any pressure whatsoever, but we could do with that bed, of course. We understand that. Can I read you something? Of course. "When your need for care is primarily due to your need "for health care, "you may be eligible for NHS Continuing Healthcare. "A complete package of ongoing care arranged and funded by the NHS "to meet physical or mental health needs that have arisen "because of disability, accident or illness." Why didn't you mention this? I thought we did. You didn't. Well, we did assess her informally and she didn't qualify, so... Well, can you do it formally, please? Well, that would be a waste of time, I'm afraid. We would do that only if you insist. Oh, we insist. OK. But don't build your hopes up. Please, don't do that. Auntie Claire! Auntie Claire! Hiya! Claire with eclairs! Hey! Not for you! Hands off! Your mum. Is, um, Nick still on the scene? This came this morning. Mum's assessment. It's been rejected. Is he married? What do we do? We appeal. Is he married? No. Good. Don't attack them. Do you want to do it? If you'd like to take a seat? Good morning. My name is James Simpson and I will be chairing this independent review panel scrutiny of the rejection of Mary Taylor's application for NHS Continuing Healthcare. Could we all please introduce ourselves? Angela Bellman, geriatric nurse. David Tully, psychiatric nurse. Shirley Woodford, social services administrator. Jenny Northwood, Mary's daughter. Claire Taylor, Mary's daughter. We were expecting someone from the hospital, but as it is well past ten o'clock, we'll make a start without them. I apologise that you have been kept waiting. Hi, I'm so sorry, I was held up on the ward. If you would like to give us your name, take a seat, we'll carry on. Yeah. Amanda Jennings, discharge liaison officer, standing in for Rebecca Compton, head of the stroke unit. First, I'd like to invite members of the panel to ask you both any questions they may have. Is that all right with you? Can you tell us a bit about your mother before the stroke? She was very independent. She's lived on her own since Dad died. She did everything for herself. Did she have mobility problems? No. Her knee sometimes, but... And did she have any hobbies? Politics, in general. Labour Party in particular. Liked the telly. Wildlife shows, bit of drama, Newsnight. And her personality? Self-contained, very proud, very principled. And directly after the stroke, did her personality change? Yes. She became noisy, uninhibited, angry. She kept seeing my father in every man on the ward. And how is her behaviour now? Even worse. Jenny's called in nearly every day to feed and medicate her, because the staff can't cope. She is violent and lashes out at them, out of terror, I think. Or pain. Can I...? Why all this? I'll tell you why. Money. There's nearly a million old people with dementia and to give them the treatment they need costs serious money. And why spend serious money on the old? Hence all this. Hence you, Amanda, barring the gates, playing God with people's lives. Well, that's fine. But you are not going to do it with my mother's. I'm sorry, just give me... I'm sorry, Jenny. I'm sorry. There's a report in front of you. I think you will remember, Amanda, that we went to the Court of Protection cos Mum wasn't capable of granting us power of attorney. Yeah. To do that, you need a consultant report, so I'd like to read that to you, if I may. "Mrs Taylor has suffered a major stroke and has developed "severe cognitive impairment. "She has expressive and receptive dysphasia "and cannot retain information. "She is confused and fails to understand. "It is extremely difficult to communicate with her. "She was found wandering the ward, agitated and occasionally "very aggressive. "Mrs..." Sorry. "Mrs Taylor has significant mental health issues "and has lost the ability to make decisions. "There has been no evidence of any improvement. "It is likely that these adverse effects will be long-term. "She needs supervision and 24-hour care from qualified nursing staff "for her medication and other daily activities." He seems to think she's seriously ill. You seem to think she's fine. Why such a difference? There's another form in front of you. This is the questionnaire that my mother supposedly filled in. This is the document that I think cost my mother her continuing health care. "Do you feel happy?" Answer A, all of the time, B, most of the time, C, rarely, D, never. My mother has answered, B, most of the time. And there's lots of other questions on there, as you can see, that my mother's answered A's and B's for, nothing critical whatsoever. So this woman who the consultant described as "unable to understand and difficult to communicate with" has answered every single answer on this form. Are you saying someone else filled it in? Yeah, I am. I mean, if you gave my mother a form, she'd eat it. Miss Jennings? I can't explain it, I'm afraid. Anything else? Yeah. My mum has been in hospital just twice before. When she had me and when she had Claire. Apart from that, she has not cost the NHS a penny, yet she's contributed to it her whole working life. Well, now she's sick. She needs 24-hour nursing care. She needs a doctor, a counsellor, a gastroenterologist, a physiotherapist, my mother deserves these things. She deserves a place that meets her needs. Anything else? Miss Jennings? In that case, can I ask you both to step outside for five minutes whilst we have a quick chat? Thank you. Hi. Hi. Thanks. A disadvantage. Yeah. I'm sorry. Can I say something? I'd like to give you all a break, treat dementia with the seriousness it deserves in hospitals like mine. But do you know what that means? A nurse being called away from a young person fighting for life, because an old woman in the next room has shit herself. Please come in. Thank you for your patience. A committee must decide only on the evidence before us. However, we are in agreement that this assessment does not accurately reflect the state of Mary's health and we are therefore ordering a new assessment to be carried out as soon as possible. This will take a while. But I can tell you now that we are minded to allow your appeal. So you should go ahead and look for a nursing home that can cater for Mary's needs. And if, as I believe, you have already found one, perhaps you should start talking seriously to them. You will receive a letter confirming this over the next couple of weeks. Thank you. Thank you for your time, good to meet you. There you go. That's it. We're thinking of adopting. I've been on the IVF for a while now and... ...so, we're trying something else. Hello, Mary. Welcome to Marshal House.
