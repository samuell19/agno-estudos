- [Woman] Now, Louise, before we begin recording, perhaps we could just have a little chat. - Yeah, I think that's a good idea. - [Woman] Louise, do you think that perhaps you're being just a little demanding in your requirements? Because we did have very high hopes for you and Paul, and I seem to remember him saying that he was really quite smitten. - I don't think my requirements were that demanding. - [Woman] Well, that of course is entirely your opinion, but we feel that he did fulfill all your specifications. So, tell me, what is it that we can supply this time that we didn't supply last time? - What am I looking for that's different from last time? Let me see. Oh, I know.

And if we're honest, we think it's a bit of a joke. I mean, you'd know, wouldn't you? But I didn't, and I'm used to being around gay people. I've learnt my lesson. I'd never introduce my man to my gay friends again. But I don't mind introducing you to my friends. Well, at least I thought they were my friends. This is Alex, my best friend. He wanted to be an actor. He'd been with Harry for a year. In fact, it was their anniversary. Harry was all right, but he could be a bit smarmy. Just kept him happy by buying him things. Oh, and here's Tom. Tom was about to have a major exhibition, but he was more concerned about keeping Lars happy. Lars is very good looking, but he knew it. You know the type. He'd got expensive tastes, but it was always someone else who picked up the bill. And William, William had a tough time over the last few years, but he was coming out the other side, and he'd just met Lawrence. Lawrence is an actor, so you can imagine what a handful he was. (siren blaring) You'd recognize him. He was in that doctors thing. I thought I was the one out of all my friends that had got it sorted. So let me tell you what happened to me one day last summer. I was going on my first proper date with Paul. I thought he was perfect. ♪ It's over ♪ (upbeat techno music) - Go, let me see seven, let me see six, let me see five, let me see four.

Listen, I'm, uh, stuck in traffic. It's not moving. I reckon I'm gonna have to turn around and go back. Yeah, I'm gutted too. I was really looking forward to fitting your kitchen. Yeah, listen, the battery on my phone's running low. I'll give you a call next... - Hello? (gentle instrumental music) - I thought you were fitting in Louise's washing machine? - Still waiting for a part. Can I have another one? - [Tom] I thought you might have had enough. - You know me. I've never had enough. - Better make sure I don't. - Is that a threat? - Take it any way you want. - I'll take it as a threat then. I'll get my stuff and I'll be out of here. - Look, it's not a threat. I'm really sorry. I've just had a hard day. - I'm going out. - Love. - Tom sees the good in people. - Sees the good in people? What he sees is a good bit of ass that he wouldn't stand a chance with if he didn't have a Gucci store card. Anyway, getting back to me. Harry bought me the original artwork for the 1977 Dalek annual. It's like the Bible of Doctor Who fans. (door bell jingling) - All right? Hi, I can't stop. I've got a meeting. - I wasn't trying to hold you up. - Well, that's all right now, isn't it? - Isn't that that Greek doctor from Emergency Accident? - He's only a nurse. - How do you know him? Have you, you know? - As if. He went out with one of my exes. He's been around forever. I knew him when he was on the dole. - Sorry, got held up in the edit. How'd the audition go? - Don't want to talk about it. - What's the matter with you? - Lawrence Wright's upstairs. Very Greek name, isn't it? There are hardly any roles for Greeks as it is, so why should he get the part above a real one? - Why are you bothered? You're not Greek. - [Alex] I'm not bothered. I'm not bothered at all. - You write the parts do you? - Well someone has to stand up for Greek actors. - Do you want me to beat him up for you? - Yes, please. - And how are you, darling? - Oh, she's all right, come on. We're gonna be late. - Hello, how are you? - Hello, yeah. - Hey, and you. - Hello - Ah, you don't phone, you don't write. - I've been frantic. Give me a break. - Are you not stopping? - Visiting my mother. - Which we're late for. - Then we got a nice meal booked. - Mm, just my luck that our anniversary's on the same day as his bloody mother's birthday. - Congratulations. - We keep threatening to do something don't we? We must arrange a Sunday lunch. Bring George. - Don't mention George. I've got three days' peace.

(chuckles softly) - No one guessed until only a few years ago. Even Harry. He played rugby for the county. - Mm, probably the physical contact with all those sweaty men that he liked. - Hm. When I heard that he'd come out, I had hoped that William and, but no. William found this for me last year. We think it's a young Thomas Huxley. Huxley, biologist, hm. - I'm seeing Tom tomorrow. - Oh, Tom. So talented. There was an article on his new exhibition. I had hoped that Harry and he were, well they spent so much time at university together. But as usual, a mother's wishes count for nothing. Which university did you go? (gasps softly) Oh. Yes, of course. We've had this conversation, haven't we? - Tom's taken up with a mad hooker who's fleecing him for all he's got. - Well, that's not, that's not strictly true, is it? - Harry tells me you've been doing very well in your job as a waiter. - It's not just being a waiter. It's also helping to prepare the food. And, anyway, it's only until the acting takes off. - Oh, yes, of course. You want to be an actor, don't you? Hm, Harry tells me that you may be an extra in some soap opera. (Alex chuckles) - It's nice that Harry keeps you so well-informed.

Tom rang. Can you meet him in the gallery? He said, or at home. - Hm. - And lastly, I'm pregnant. - You're fired. Any idea who the father is? - I've narrowed it down to the fleet auxiliary, but I've convinced John it's his. - I suppose we have to hug? - It's expected. - Congratulations. Give John my best. - You don't do gay right. - No, it's just I don't do those. - By now, my other gay friends would be squeezing the life out of me and screaming about taking me shopping for maternity clothes. - Hm. - Maybe it's just expected of you because you are posh and went to private school. - Well, that's it. I'm not gay at all. It all fits. I don't like musicals, rows in the street, cocaine. Well done. Means I've got to get another assistant. - I'm so glad I didn't get the job. If you go on a soap opera, you can get typecast, and that's so not where I want to be at this point in my career. It's a fact that all the good jobs go to the extras from the top handful of agencies. And surprise, surprise, Lawrence Wright was taken on by one of them. He must have slept with one of the bookers, 'cause he ain't that good. I know I've got talent and that I'm going to make it. I think they'll be impressed by the CV. I know it doesn't show that many roles, but they'll see from the amount of classes and workshops that I've attended that I have a real dedication. - Alex, listen, I'll have to talk to you later, babe. - Thank you. Darling, there you are. Will you stop disappearing like this? Now, come on. (power drill whirring) - How long have you been there? - Not long. What do you think? - I think they're shit. But as long as people are stupid enough to pay for them, it's all good with me. - My work represents a positive affirmation of what it is to be gay in the 21st century. Because to me, gayness isn't just about sex, it's about everything. I patronize gay restaurants and taxi firms, and, in a way, I'm developing a totally new gay art. - I wish he would just shut up. - I think it's interesting. - No, you don't. You think it's bollocks. - Shh. - The lines and dots that make up the image are in actual fact not made up of just one color, but all the colors of the rainbow, the gay rainbow. It's like pointillism, only gay. ♪ Hey, you're talking ♪ ♪ Blah blah blah ♪ ♪ Blah blah blah ♪ ♪ Blah blah ♪ - So, is Harry coming? - Him and Alex went to Brighton for the weekend. ♪ Hey, you're talking, blah blah blah ♪ - So, how much would something like that go for, then? - 150 grand. - What? - Yeah, I know. - I thought that was a fake. - No, believe me, I have earned it. - So you're not really into him, then. - It's not just the money. He's all right. I look really bad now, don't I? - Lars. - Don't mind me. I'm not judging. (upbeat pop music) - I'm off. - Where you going this time? - I told you. - I know he's seeing other people, but when I confront him about it, he denies it and says if that's what I believe, I should throw him out. - Maybe you should, if it's making you unhappy. - No, he knows I never would. - [Harry] That's why he's messing you around. He hasn't got any boundaries. - [Tom] He's not a child. - Don't treat him like one, then. - I don't. - You do. He lives rent-free. You buy his clothes. You give him money, pocket money. You treat him like a child. He's not the first, is he? (bicycle bell dings) - You really have to stop being ashamed of being gay. (scoffing) You're just buying into that straight-dominated way of looking at gay life. If Lars were a woman, you wouldn't think there was anything strange about her being supported by a male partner, would you? And that's all I'm doing. I'm helping Lars out until he gets his singing career off the ground. - Singing? I thought it was modeling. - Well, that didn't work out. There's nothing you could do for him, is there? - Wonderful, that's right. Yep, yep. Okay. That sounds perfect. Thank you. Alex, please hurry. We don't have time. Come on, darling. Excellent. Actually, I'm gonna call you back. Thank you, okay, thanks. Alex, can you just do what I tell you, please? - I think there's something wrong. - I don't pay you to think. - These are the wrong ones. - What are you talking about? - These are the returns from Samuelson's. (gentle instrumental music) They may have tasted all right, but they've been out for God knows how long. I mean, crawling with E coli and stuff. Lethal. Older people or children could have died. I've never seen someone look so contrite. She was in floods. I mean, she could have gone to prison. Trouble is, she doesn't really pay attention. It's only a hobby her husband organized for her to keep her occupied whilst he's doing corporate takeovers. And her menu is so old-fashioned. It's like something served halftime at the Battle of Hastings. I told her about my cinnamon twirls, and we're going to try them out next week. - You're a real hero. All I do is make crap telly. - Do something about it, then. What do you want to do? Seriously. - What I want to do is travel around Asia, but I can't, can I? I've got career responsibilities. More importantly, in half an hour, the cab gets here. What shall we do with the time? (gentle instrumental music) - It's Thursday. (chuckling) - Well, that's right. What if Matron were to find us? - I've been on bedpans all morning, so I'm entitled. It's in my equity agreement. (both laughing) - Sorry. (knocking on door) - Yes? What do you want, you beastly little peeping tom? - They need you in set in five minutes. - (sighs) My public are calling for me. I don't suppose you're free later. - Got a parents' meeting. - What time does it finish? - Eight o'clock, but then I've got to be at home. She keeps waking up during the night lately. Mum's getting too old to have her sleep disturbed, so. - Well I could always come to you, now that she's met me. - I'm not sure, Lawrence. Hey, look, why don't we have a weekend away? Georgie's going to see some friends. We could have two whole nights. What do you reckon? - Okay. - See you later. Break a leg and, whatever it is you do. - Ciao. - [Man On PA] Train pro announcement, train pro announcement. Will driver Cartwright. - Are you ready, gents? Action. (cat meowing) - Oh, Maggie, that's looking really beautiful. - [Both] Oh, yes. It's really, really beautiful. Jim and Jill will really, really love it. - Right, let's get that lovely cup of tea we've been promising ourselves, then we'll see what the gorgeous Charlie's been up to all morning. - Cut. That looks really, really shit. (cat meowing) (gentle instrumental music) (gargling) - Georgie. Don't you think you're being just a little harsh on this doll? All she did was say hello to this doll's boyfriend. - She must die. (gagging) (moaning) (sighs) (soft hammering) - And I'd have expected a bit more to have been done in here. Remind me again when Jim and Jill are coming back? - Sunday morning. - Sunday morning. - I think I'd better have a word with the gorgeous Charlie. You're being a bit of a slow coach today, Charlie. We've only got until Sunday, you know. (sobbing) - And cut. - [Charlie] I loved her! (sobbing) - Yeah, well by period, they probably thought they were getting Victorian rustic or Edwardian country house, not fucking Stalingrad, 1943. - Yeah, well, what are we gonna do?

I thought you were looking forward to the sleepover. - Hanna's a poo-head. - She's your best friend. - [Georgie] She's still a poo-head. I want to come with you to Brighton. - It'd be boring.

I guarantee he'll be nothing but trouble. Oh well, it's your funeral. - Ta-da. What do you think? - It's great, but on you it's only ever gonna be like sticking a sequin on a rat's ass. - You look amazing. - Thank you. - (laughs) No, you look fab. Tell her she looks great. She's got a date with that Paul tonight. She thinks he's the one. - Gorgeous. - Thank you, Harry. - Anyway, you can tell Lars that he's coming for dinner next week. I've rung Tom and invited him. Oh, and I bumped into William. He's bringing his new beau. I don't know. He's an actor, I think. And if he hasn't dumped her by then, Louise is bringing Paul. Gotta go. Oh my god. I've found something that even you would look good in. - Thanks. (upbeat pop music) (saw grinding) - [Harry] Are they brother and sister? - I don't know, what do you think? - I don't know. - I have no idea. - They just look at each other very strangely. - I have no idea. Do you think it matters? - I don't know, well. - Harry. - Yeah. - I just want to say, I'm very grateful for this opportunity. - Oh, hey, don't worry about it. But don't get your hopes up, 'cause it could only just be for the one show. - Mm. - Still, I know people think I'm trouble, and you probably could have found somebody else for the job if you'd really tried. But, if it did become a regular gig, as I said, I'd be very grateful. - Yeah. (soft pop music) (cell phone ringing) (car horns honking) - Hey. - I can't just leave her like this. Well, I don't know. No, she hasn't got a fever. Yes, darling? - It's your move. - Well, you go back in there and tell Grandma to move for me, yeah? - Okay. - Thank you. Sorry. - No. No, of course I understand. Maybe I could come to you. - We could meet for lunch on Tuesday. - Oh, a whole lunchtime. Are you sure you can manage that? Twat! (upbeat pop music) - Harry, hello. Put your tongue back in. There's a good boy. - I was just, um, thinking about the. - Mm. These are delicious, darling. You'll want royalties now, won't you? - That just may be, but, I can't make a peach smell like a banana, can I? So. All right. Cheers. Uh. - I've always thought that you were the only one of Tom's friends who wasn't a fucking idiot. - (scoffs) I'll take that as a compliment. - I've seen you looking, so don't even pretend you're not interested. - Things happen for a reason, and this was obviously meant to be. I'm feeling very positive. Although you have to know how to deal with negativity, have to know how to transform a negative into a positive. For example, I didn't get the job on Londoners, which was a negative. But on the positive side, I took the power back and sent my photo and CV off to the top actors' agencies. But they've all written back saying that they're not interested, which, again, is a negative. In other words, I didn't go to fucking RADA or one of the other good drama schools, so I don't have that stamp of approval. Not at all interested in the classes I've attended, or the commitment I've shown. It's not all about diplomas and pieces of paper. What about natural talent? Van Gogh didn't go to art school, and he ended up all right, didn't he? - Uh, yeah, I suppose. Have you seen my red pullover? - Dry cleaners. - Shit. - [Alex] Well? - What? - How did it all go? - Oh, it was all right. Yeah. Same as these things ever are, really, you know. - Lars didn't disgrace himself? - Nope. No, he was all right. - Are you gonna take him on permanently? - No, no, it's just gonna be a one-off. (gentle instrumental music) - You all right? - Yep. I'm just, I'm knackered actually. (cell phone ringing) - Hello, babe. Yeah, he's here. It's Lars. He says your phone's permanently turned off.

And there's Sharon. - Oh, no, Sharon's your sister. She doesn't count. - I don't know. I just get on with gay men.

She's had to endure a very acrimonious divorce, and then she loses her mother in a car crash. I know you mean well, but I can't have her getting to know a succession of lovers just for them to disappear. She needs stability. - A succession? - Oh, that's hardly the point, is it? - I just want to say, I think you're great. - Oh, just fuck off. I'm sorry, I meant, fuck off, I'm having a private conversation. - Sorry. - Any other day, just not today. So, is this the way it's gonna be? - Oh, please. I've already got one nine-year-old who likes tantrums. (people chattering in foreign language) - Yeah, I know. Well, I picked up a couple of stickers anyway. Madonna. Yeah. Yeah. Well, why don't I call everybody and just, you know, put it off for awhile? Well, you've been through a lot recently, haven't you? The meat will freeze, and you can pick up the veg tomorrow.

It's about having something in you that, oh, what's the point? - Don't know what the big deal is about being gay.

Anyway, I got talking to this chap Douglas. He was very interested when I told him that I was an actor. It turns out that he's a closet writer/director, and he's got this project that he's been working on for years. He told me all about it, and could see that I was fascinated. - Well, where did you put it? - You keep saying. I don't know. - You really are gonna have to start getting your stuff ready the night before, okay? - And to cut a long story short, we're putting on a play. It's only a one-man thing, but it's being done properly, all financed by Douglas, who's obviously got a bob or two. It's about an economist called Thomas Malthus, and it's all about this influential theory that he wrote. On the Principles of Population, 1798, revised 1803. Basically saying that, well, it's a bit complicated, but he said that the poor die off when there's not much work about, which apparently is a good thing, or something like that. - Found it.

Well, he just upped his offer. I did leave you a note, I think.

Filthy, unwanted mouths. - What are you doing? - [William] Working. And you should be in bed. - Just five minutes. I could help. - All right, then, five minutes. And if you want to help, sit here. Have a look at these. What do you make of these two? - It's the same lady, only in this one, she's got her back to us. They're wearing the same hat. All the dangly bits match, just the other way round. And look. It's even made of the same straw stuff. It is her, isn't it? I am right. - I think you might be. (upbeat instrumental music) (knocking on door) (chuckles softly) - Lars only admitted it to Tom out of spite, you know? Just a parting shot before he sailed off into the sunset with his double-glazing millionaire. - I always expected something like this would happen. - What? You expected me to go off with someone else? - No, not that. But I suppose I didn't know what you ever saw in me, anyway.

This was the end of the Wars of the Roses. This is where the House of Lancaster and the House of Cornwall, what? - What? - Fought to be Kings of England. Now, when the Wars of the Roses ended, that was also the end of the Hundred Years' War. - Why weren't you angry? - Hm? - When I believed Lars and not you. I mean, if the roles had been reversed, I'd have been furious that you hadn't trusted my word over that of a known scum bag. - Where is this going? Do you think I really did sleep with him? - No. - Good. I did find him attractive, and I suppose I was responsible for the way he reacted 'cause I led him on. But when it came down to it, I couldn't risk what I had with you. - You didn't seem to have any faith in me. - When King Henry VIII was dying, he smelled so rotten because of all the pus from the disease that people were actually sick if they went near him. And when he died, he was succeeded by his son Edward, but it didn't last very long. In fact, it was rather boring. And he was succeeded by Mary, Queen of Scots. - Daddy, you're wrong. It wasn't Mary, Queen of Scots. She came later. It was Bloody Mary. And she had all the people who didn't like her religion tortured by being burned and having their stomachs pulled out by rusty iron hooks. - That's not true. - Is. - Is it? - Yeah. - [Tom] It's disgusting. - Mm-hm. (dramatic music) - Harry, I don't want to leave here. I'm sorry, but I don't want us to go out anymore. You see, until now, I've never really had any control over my life. I've always lived with people who took all the responsibility, whether it was my family or flatmates or lovers. For the first time, I feel like I've got some power. You know, I chose this place. I furnished and decorated it. If I don't post the money off to the electricity people, the lights go out. (sighs) And the business, it's hard work, but, I love it, and it's something I'm good at. I make mistakes, but I learn from them. I'd always been looking for someone like you, a Mr. Right to come along, look after me, and I found him. I am going to miss that safety and security I feel when I'm with him. - I love you. - Oh, I love you, too. - Hm. - And this is possibly the worst, most difficult decision I'm going to make in my life, but I have to let him go. (dramatic techno music) - So, this is it? - It's his drawing style, and the paper's right. This is Mary Cassatt. She was an American artist living in Paris. That's where she met Degas. He drew her many times over the years, but this one is from 1879. It's a study for a mural that was never completed, and it was exhibited at the Fourth Impressionist Exhibition, so if I'm right, mine's a fragment of a picture produced for the same project. I mean, it's rough. The hat's superimposed on the hat as almost an afterthought, but Degas did that with his working drawings. It's probably cut away from a larger sheet as a memento for someone, that sort of thing. ♪ Angel ♪ - I may be wrong, but my instincts are good. ♪ In my bed ♪ - All I know is that it's, it's beautiful.
