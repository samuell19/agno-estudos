Saint Bay, do you copy? Come in, Saint Bay. Argo to Saint Bay station. Argo to Saint Bay station. Come in, Saint Bay. This is Saint Bay station. Come in, Argo. This is Kai Li Cain from the Wayne expedition. We've found the Cobblepot base camp... or what's left of it. Mr. Wayne is with Grayson and Tawde looking for survivors. Dick, Sanjay, report. It's bad, sir. Nothing but dead bodies. Yeah. Heaps of 'em. We found the ship's manifest, sir. We're still two short. Someone named Grendon, and then Cobblepot himself. Not to go grummy, Mr. Wayne, but the odds of anyone surviving out here... We keep looking. Professor Cobblepot's journal? "Expedition day three. Men are on edge. The dogs will still not leave the ship. It's this place. They fear it. And I must confess... I don't blame them. Day seven... Things are worse. Could not calm the dogs. Forced to kill them all. Grendon has disappeared. Has gone mad, I fear. And the others, they won't speak. They refuse to even move. Day ten, just me now. When I close my eyes... I hear it calling. From the ice." Cobblepot? "It tells me it's coming." Professor Cobblepot! Oswald! "It tells me... I have come home." Cobblepot? Cobblepot is no more. He's something else now. He's become what he was always meant to be. I take it you're Grendon. Was Grendon. Once. Now I'm chosen by him to be his messenger to the world. I see. And who is "him", exactly? Him is he who bays and slavers forever outside time and space, who shambled down out of the stars when Earth new and spawned abominations in the seas and blights upon the land. Woe to man when he comes again. To gaze upon his form is to invite madness. That is why, in order to serve him, I chose to make... adjustments. You're gonna come with me. Now! No. No! I'm not finished yet. Hark... The lurker is on the threshold. And behold... It... Is... Coming. Shore party to Argo. This is Argo. Go ahead. Kai Li, ready the explosives. Uh, did you say explosives? I mean, sure, Mr. Wayne. How many? All of them. Whoo! Hot dog! Nothing'll get into or out of that cave ever again. You sure sealing it off was wise? The scientific value of a prehistoric creature like the one you described-- Is far less than the danger it posed. That thing has infected the surrounding wildlife here with some sort of mutational agent. A virus that must've lain dormant for millennia. And it's quite possible, it infected some of the Cobblepot party as well. So, whatever that creature was, Dick, it was meant to stay buried. Sir, what about Cobblepot? Did you ever find him? Cobblepot's gone. Heavens, what is that ghastly smell? That would be your friend, Grendon. Once we warmed him up, he started to spoil. Spoil? The old palooka's dead as a donkey. Right, Dicky? The tissue samples I took from him appear to be dead, -but I'm sure there's a logical-- -Logical explanation. You know, ace, you're starting to sound more like the big cheese every day. May I ask where this rather loquacious cadaver is, presently? Until Dick can whip up something to keep the body frozen, Mr. Wayne had us put him on ice. He instructed me to put Mr. Grendon in the meat freezer, Alfred. I do so look forward to fetching this evening's roast. "Though I am strayed, my Testament shall remain in Gotham. Forever in my keep." Master Bruce, about this Grendon. -Perhaps it's time for another-- -Gotham is in danger. You gleaned that from Cobblepot's journal, sir? I'm sure of it now. But from what you told me, the professor was not of sound mind. Believe me, Alfred, I took that into consideration. Unhinged rantings aside, his journal confirms much of what I've uncovered about the existence of an ancient cult. And if any of what he writes is true, it's a cult that has long ties to Gotham. Then should I take this to mean... It's been 20 years since we left, Alfred. Twenty years preparing. And now... It's time. We're going home. How long you figure we'll be in Gotham? We're here for good, kid. Horsefeathers! In the two years I've been with you we haven't stayed in any city for more than a few weeks. Come to think of it... I've never stayed in any city for more than a few weeks. I've been traveling with Bruce coming on a decade now, Kai Li. And it's always been about returning to Gotham. Okay, but returning for what? Doom. You return for your doom. Nuts to you, ya rank spud. It appears Gotham has become a bit more... Untended than we remember it. Let's hope it's nothing like I remember it, Alfred. Gotham's history is our history, son. Wayne family history. The Waynes built this city, Bruce. That makes you part of a long legacy. What's a legacy? It means, one day, you'll have very big shoes to fill. Come now, Martha. It's more important a man learn to stand on his own feet before cramming them into someone else's shoes. Isn't that right, son? We have brought this curse upon us! Thomas! Bruce, run! Just-- Grendon's secure, sir. You sure you want us to just leave him here? For now. If he was exposed to that virus... I don't trust the Gotham Police to use the same precautions we have. Understood. But I'll need one of you to stay back and keep an eye on him. Tough luck, Sanjay. Damn it. Aye aye, Cap. And why not? After months at sea, what's a few more days on this fine vessel? It'll give me a chance to cozy up with the nutso diseased corpse. Hear that? Just you and me now, Mr. Zero. Lucius. So good to see you. You as well, son. Nice work, Alfred. You brought him home in one piece. Not for his lack of trying, old friend. How's business, Lucius? Copacetic. So long as the board believes all executive directives are coming from you, that is. For some reason, they just don't seem quite comfortable taking orders from me. Well then, I guess you'll just have to continue making sure that all my directives are... Copacetic. I plan to. And you received my last consignment? Like all your shipments over the years, I had everything situated in the wine cellar to your precise specifications. Thank you, Lucius. One thing... Wine cellar? Let's not romanticize it. It's a cave. Whoa. Wow. Swanky. Master Bruce, it appears word of your return has spread, sir. Oliver Queen has invited you for dinner and drinks. I shall assume he intends an emphasis on the latter. Master Bruce? Something isn't right. Claw marks? It's some sort of animal attack. -A bear, maybe? -No. The wounds are made bottom up. Ursine claws are incapable of that kind of movement. This bruise... -Strangulation. -Means whatever did this had thumbs. Obviously, he was killed elsewhere and brought here. But why? I am... Langstrom. Bruce, what is it? Did you... Ah. Nevermind. Should we notify the police? Yes. But, not yet. I'll handle it. Are you sure you're up for dinner, sir? This house has been sealed for 20 years and the corpse downstairs isn't doing the fustiness any favors. At the very least, we could stand the fresh air. Besides, I haven't seen Oliver since we ran into each other in... Dushanbe. My name is Blood. You do not want to know me or what I am. Suffice it to say, what is invisible to most is visible to me. Is that so? June 26th, 1908. You witnessed your parents' murder. In the ensuing years, you set upon the world, absorbing all forms of criminology, psychology, martial art... Whatever skills you deemed necessary to one day avenge your parents' deaths and become this city's savior. The Bat. Do you have a point, Mr. Blood? Your homecoming has set certain wheels in motion, Bruce Wayne. And though I know much, I'm only allowed to tell you these things three. One. You must seek out two spirits. Spirits? One wrapped in bats, the other in flames. Two. To prevail in this, Bruce Wayne must die and through death become himself. Three. Before it can be saved, Gotham... must be burned to the ground. Listen, I'm not sure what your game is, but I'm not big on ghost stories. Your dubiety will be your undoing. You wanna talk undoing? You'll find no enemy here, my thickheaded friend. Rest assured when you face your foe, you'll see me again. I've readied the car for... dinner. And then Bruce says to the man, "Sorry constable, it was dog fur." That's not quite how it went, Ollie. Oh, come on, Brucey, you gotta embellish. It's called showmanship. Right, Kelley? It's Kai Li. Attagirl. Oh. I hear you ran into one of Gotham's finest down south. Easy, fellas. Old Cobblepot was mad as a march hare well before his expedition. So, Mr. Queen, I notice you're into hunting. It's a passion that's taken me around the world. Not a matter of flora nor fauna alive, that can best Oliver Queen. You do know flora are plants, right? Of course. And I stand by my assertion. For what plant could-- Oh, bully! My surprise guest. One of Bruce and my oldest chums and the man who will single-handedly clean the fetid streets of our lost city, I give you Gotham's future mayor, Harvey Dent. Let's not count chickens, Ollie. Election's not for four days and... I'll be... Bruce Wayne. Look at you, kid. Good to see you, Harvey. It's been too long. And look at us three. Together again. So... You gonna offer me a drink, or not? Wayne residence. Mr. Wayne is out for the evening. Is there a message I could-- So then, Harv, I look this dewdropper square in his eyes. And I say, "Sorry constable, it was duck fur." Tell me something, Harv. Does the name "Langstrom" mean anything to you? Professor Kirk Langstrom? The Batman of crime alley? He's loonier than Cobblepot. Come to think of it, there has been an uptick in crackpots lately, which is saying something. Gotham's always had more than our fair share of wingnuts. Langstrom is a biologist at the university. A chiropterologist, actually. Of late, he's rather infamously developed an unhealthy obsession with the bats he studies. Unhealthy how? He claims to be one. Would you have an address for him? Somewhere in Robin's Row. I'll call the office. Speaking of the office, gentlemen, I have to report to it in six hours. You'll have to show me how to do that coin trick next time, Mr. Dent. Sorry, sport. Magicians don't spill. We'd best retire as well. -Say, Ollie... -Huh? Since Alfred's still airing out the house, would you mind putting us up for the night? Mind? I'll ring for more sherry. Keep an eye on Oliver. I'm beginning to think Sanjay drew the lucky straw. First, I thought I failed. But I feel the power of his cold gift inside me. Shut your yap-- Ow! Just dummy up, would ya? Everybody! Ida Sweet as apple cider Sweeter than all I know Come out In the silvery moonlight... Where's Bruce? If he's smart, back in Antarctica. Low, low, low, low, low Everybody! Landlady said it sounded like a murder. I don't see no bodies. You look for bodies, junior. Screwballs like Langstrom, always keep some dough squirreled away. Hurry up and find it, will ya? Before Gordon gets back-- Jumped up jimminy! Find what you were looking for? Ventilate this son of a bitch. Langstrom... The hell were you into? Okay, boys. Let's wrap the-- What the... Wayne residence. As I've stated thrice already, Ms. Barbara, Mr. Wayne is out for the evening. Now, I will certainly deliver-- "If you're reading this, I, Dr. Kirk Langstrom, am dead. Thankfully. For a great doom is coming to this world. Though you will think me mad, believe me, if you can. The bats speak to me. They see beyond what man dare fathom. And they tell me of a growing horror. A thing, crouching, at the doorstep of our reality. And it is hungry for us. And it wants our world. For centuries, acolytes of this evil, the 'Cult of Ghul' have endeavored to unlock the very door that keeps the thing from our reality. And now, their time is nigh. Yet, there is still a single hope. They require a book, The Testament of Ghul. For only with the knowledge contained in its pages may they open that door. The Testament must be kept from them, at all costs." Testament. "My Testament shall remain in Gotham. Forever in my keep." Cobblepot had it. University repository. Professor Manfurd speaking. Do you have keep of Professor Cobblepot's records? While he's on sabbatical, yes. Who is this, please? The Testament of Ghul... I need it. Testament of... No, I am not familiar with such a text. Of course, this is not a lending library, sir. This is the university repository restricted to the public, if you-- Cobblepot ordered me to destroy you. Oh, but even if I could, I would not. I, for one, am so very glad at that. Talia? But how? You know who I am. Good. Please, don't kill me! We'll leave that business to... Daitya. No! The Testament. Now! No. Do as you will, Daitya. What the... Etrigan. You were told you know not what you face. Yet only you can stop it, so leave this place. My sacrifice is made so you might end this curse. Alas, it'd be for naught should the book remain hers! Let's try this again. The book. Now. Do not think your costume can frighten me, Bat. I am well acquainted with real matter of demon, Djinn and devil. Whatever the Cult of Ghul is planning, it ends here. The Cult of Ghul perished centuries ago. I am its last... For now. After leaving you that surprise in your study, I was certain, you'd realize I was not one to be trifled with. You knew I'd lead you to The Testament. You killed Langstrom. You have no clue the power this book possesses. I know those who seek it mean to do this city harm. Quite the contrary. We mean to give this city purpose and honor the damnation which bore it. You, on the other hand, we mean to do harm. It can't be. Another monster. You don't go 812 years without making your share of interesting friends. The bat still lives. Mm. No matter. He poses no serious threat to us. Besides, you are needed for another errand. The key has been delivered to the harbor. Retrieve it. To think, in our letters to each other, I used to rib Bruce for collecting a stray ragamuffin at every port. But you two... You two are on the level. Of course, you can do no better than Bruce Wayne. Bruce. I owe the man. Lord, I owe him more than he could possibly know. I'm so sorry, Brucey... So sorry. All right, easy there. I'm sure everything is fine, sir. Mr. Wayne isn't one to hold a grudge against a good man. Come on, let's get some sleep. Am I though? A good man? Never forget, the sins of the father are heaped upon the son. Thanks, Mr. Queen. Good to know. Alfred. Master Bruce. What's happened? Not sure. Yet. Is that sulfur? You're wounded. I have to clean-- Not yet. I have to analyze this substance. For when I run into the mutated creature again. Mutated creature? Wait, where are you off to? The cave. We have work to do. It's a wine cellar, Master Bruce. We're not Neanderthals Boys... It is still June, isn't it? Hold up, kid. Ship's off limits. Heya, boys. Oliver Queen. What are you doing here? Expecting another dozen cases of your bootleg hooch, are we? And flout the prohibition laws that help keep Gotham the fine and chaste city we've all come to love? Why, Jimmy Gordon, you slay me! Tell you what though, if I do happen upon a case, I'll let you watch me polish it off. At least then, you and your boys can see what getting to the bottom of a case actually looks like. Get off it, Queen! Now listen, son... Go, go! Sanjay? Sanjay? Jay? Sanjay... I'd wise up if I were you, Jimmy. The election's in three days. If all goes pepper, my best chum, Harvey Dent, will be your boss. Think about the future-- Mercy. Come on. Let me through. Chief wants us to keep you-- No! -No! No, it's okay! -No! -No! -It's okay. No! No! I've got you. I've got you. I know. I know. I know, let it out. It's okay, let it out. What did this? I don't know, Kai Li. But by the Lord's hand... they will pay. Millennia ago, you descended upon these wicked grounds to learn secrets unholy. Now, I shall use those very secrets to give you life again. Then, together, we will usher Iog-Sotha into this reality! Daitya! You come in good time. Etrigan... Indeed. I furnished a demon to take your place in your bottle prison, Djinn. Now, you must honor your end of our bargain before returning to Hell. Scorch this cursed ground with your wretched hellfire. Come forth! My daughter... He has risen. Ra's al Ghul has risen! There are miles of tunnel below this city. Talia is down here somewhere. The book you requested, sir. I would certainly never count myself among the "believers", Master Bruce. But I have seen enough in my time to at least be wary of the dark arts. I appreciate the concern, but we don't have time for superstitions. I only mean, perhaps it would be wise to not discount such things out of hand. I'll admit a lot of what I've seen seems to defy logic. But I assure you there's a rational explanation behind all of it. What's this? "The mausoleum of the serpent?" "Before humans, there were serpents. Masters of an ancient black magic. In what would be 2000 BC, a dark priest, Ra's al Ghul, uncovered the ruins of their unholy grounds. Using necromantic arts, he wrested their secrets from them... The nature of the cosmos was his to wield. Yet, Ra's' one true desire was to serve his master... Iog-Sotha. And to bring his dark outer God into our reality." Outer gods? All myth, Alfred. Then of what use is this to us? If you look at any myth hard enough, you'll find the remnants of fact underneath. Aklo. I'm sorry, sir... Aklo? The tick marks in that etching. It's an ancient system of writing... Aklo. They're not ticks. They're coordinates. Facts. Is it possible? This mausoleum is located somewhere beneath Gotham? I'm going to find out. Check to see if our compound is ready. For a million, million years, Iog-Sotha has longed for this planet. He howls and scrapes at a door he can never open. Now, we shall descend into the unholy chamber of the serpents and invoke the ceremony that will show us this door. You can't open a door without a key. Oh, heavens, not again. Wayne residence and I assure you, Mr. Wayne is still... Oh. Chief Gordon. My apologies, sir. I thought it was your... I thought it was a wrong number. My Lord... Yes, of course. If Mr. Queen could look after Kai Li for the time being, it would be most appreciated. And the moment he returns, I... I shall inform Mr. Wayne. O thou Gog, O thou Gog, O Kore... O Persephone... O Amaga, Iog-Sotha, Darkness out of time, show us your door so that we may partake in this holy purpose and finally-- What manner of insolent worm is this? Continue the incantation, Father. We will deal with the interloper. You destroyed him. What magic is this? Not magic. Chlorine concentrate. Very well. My, you are a quick study. I suppose I'll have to dispose of you intimately. Etrigan... That's enough, Ra's. Whoever you really are and whatever your game is, it's over. Indeed, it is over... Over for you. The ritual is complete. Reptiles once ruled this earth. And now, they return with a plague that will lead us to the door. To Iog-Sotha! Extra, extra! Gotham knee-deep in lizards! Thank you. Thank you. When elected, this infestation will be my first priority. I refuse to let this be another scar on the face of our proud, beautiful city. Yes, Harvey! I say enough! The thing is coming. Today we will only show you... Show you the shape of the thing. For to gaze upon it is to invite madness! And though your mind may force itself to forget what it sees, the mark of madness it leaves behind is yours for eternity. The only thing that can stop it is the Bat. The only thing that can stop it... ...is you! I... remember. Father? And this just in, it's official, Harvey Dent is our next mayor! And in light of the sudden and miraculous disappearance of the still-inexplicable reptile infestation, one has to believe that his victory is a sign that Harvey Dent is, indeed, our city's gateway to hope. We've endured so much together. As Mayor, I promise this will be a shining new era for Gotham. Iog-Sotha has spoken. Dent is the door. Then all that remains is to retrieve the key. - Masters, I told you. I know of no key. - Imbecile. You found Yib Nogeroth, son of Iog-Sotha, in the ice. Though he sleeps, he carried out his father's will... and planted his seed in you. Of course, the gift within me. This is the key! Tell me, how may I give-- Iog-Sotha, make this gift a new vessel. The agent of your delivery. Dent. Doom... Doom... The great doom is coming. It's at the doorstep. He hasn't moved from this spot, nor so much as spoken to me since I found him. Not even after you told him about misters Tawde and Grayson? Particularly after, I'm afraid. Alfred, it's time to call Hugo. The staff at Arkham can help. Congrats, Mr. Mayor! Thanks, Pete. But I only just got the job. Now, time to see if I can deliver. I'm sure you will. The people have every faith in you. Thank you, ma'am. I won't let you down. You know, kiddo, I had three locks put on that door for a reason. Sorry, I guess curiosity. What the... Mr. Queen? What is all this? Very soon, a great evil will befall Gotham. It's up to me to defeat it. Uh-huh. I see. And, uh, how's that? Have you forgotten? "The sins of the Father are heaped upon the son." No man is guilty of more sin than my father. As impossible as it seems, Henry Queen was over 300 years old. As it goes, the cur made a pact with the devil. Over time it drove him mad. By the end, there was no vile deed the wretched bastard would refuse. Including the cold-blooded murder of Thomas and Martha Wayne. He told me of this unholy act perpetrated centuries ago. An act so wicked, so foul, it stirred this thing that would one day destroy Gotham. So, in turn, I vowed to undo each of those sins. I set about preparing to face this impending doom he warned of. Testing myself against deadly beasts. Collecting all manner of holy weapons. Like these four arrows. Stained with the very blood of St. Sebastian himself. Uh, listen, Mr. Queen, sir-- You should go. This thing knows who I am. Surely, it will come for me. Though I've enjoyed your company, it's best you not be here when it does. The door... The doorway to our reality. Where? How is it you do not yet realize? Though you once feared them, only the bats know the way to salvation. You must accept as I have. Only they will tell-- Damn it! We're running out of time! Why don't you tell me what the bats say! You said they speak to you, right? They surround you. You... The spirit wrapped in bats. Mr. Wayne. It's Oliver. I think he's... Lost his mind. Alfred told me to leave you alone, because you weren't well. But... Golly, did he hold out cheap. Listen, sir. I don't understand what's going on, but I can tell it's bad. Real bad. And whatever it is... Dick and Sanjay... Now, something's wrong with Oliver. He's dressed as a knight and going on and on about a "doom" that is coming. Poison ivy, Mayor Dent. Oh. Come now. I haven't been out of the city in months, Dr. West. Well, then, it's stress. You have had a demanding week, Harv. Now, find some time to relax. And... For Pete's sake, man! Don't scratch it! It'll just get infected. Here. Use this. Lord, grant me the strength to destroy the thing that is coming. Oh. Hello. Why, we were just talking about you. Thank goodness! If I'd killed you that easily, there'd have been no sport. Bruce? Nice outfit. You, too. Showmanship. You look awful. Easy, kid. At this point, they're all that's holding me together. But good news... And without using any of St. Sebastian's arrows. Told you no fauna could best me. Kai Li. Give us a minute. I thought I could stop it, Bruce. This thing... Thought I was ready, but nothing could prepare-- I know, Oliver. More than you realize. Bruce... Something I must confess... It's weighed on me for years. Old friend, my father... I'm so sorry, Bruce, my father, he-- Did what he did. You did nothing but live as a good man. That's all that matters. I hope you're right, Brucey... For both our sake. The bloodline can never escape the stain. The sins of the father. Whoever you are, please, kill me. Do not despair. The end is near. But you have a little more to do. It's not your fault, Mr. Wayne. Talking dead folks, reptile plagues, plant monsters, it's not... natural. No one could have seen this coming. I should have. The signs were there. I refused to heed them, because they didn't align with what I deemed to be rational. -This thing, it is coming, huh? -Soon. And I don't know how. But only I can stop it. With all due respect, sir, Oliver said the same thing. And now he's dead. He died trying to do what was right. He died because he thought he owed the world for whatever insanity his dad-- -Oliver believed the sins of the father-- -Are heaped upon the son. Yeah. I know that verse. But don't forget Ezekiel 18, "The son will not share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son." My point is, you don't have to do this. You can leave. We can leave. Get a new ship and go anywhere else. You don't owe this city anything. Most people, if they see a house on fire, would run and call for help once they're out of harm's way. While others, very few others, would run right into that house and try to save those who are trapped inside. The moment I found you, my every instinct told me which one of those two people you were. Doom or not, Kai Li, Gotham is a city on fire. It needs those who are willing to run into the inferno. Bruce Wayne, there you are. Was there something you wanted, Jim? Uh, no. Yes, actually. First, deeply sorry about your boys. My condolences. I assure you my best men are on the... I'm here on behalf of my daughter. Barbara? She said she's been trying to reach you. I'm sure you've heard about her-- Accident a few years back? Yes. Poor thing. She hasn't been the same. Wait a minute. Barbara? Barbara Gordon? The Oracle, right? I read about her in Spiritualism Monthly! Yes, I suppose Barbara has developed something of a... reputation in certain circles. And she says she needs to speak to me? Not her, exactly. -One of her-- -Ghosts. She said you'd know who. Do you? I don't. Bruce, I realize it's an unusual request. But it seemed... so very urgent to my Barbara, and it would... -It would mean a lot to me. -Tell her I'll see her tonight. -Okay. But visiting hours are-- -Tonight! Do you think the Oracle will know how to stop this thing? Not the Oracle, but the spirit wrapped in flames. It's time. I can't let you leave. That's not your decision. You're not well. What's happening to you? What needs to happen. I can't pretend to know exactly what I'm about to face. But I do know that I must face it. This is what I was meant to do. -Bruce-- -Please, Alfred. I haven't much time. Very well then, Master Bruce. If time is of the essence, as you say... May I suggest taking the car? You're in charge of the wine cellar now. You're not coming back? Goodbye... Son. Goodbye, Alfred. I'm glad you accepted my invitation. Although, I suppose, it should concern me you're able to break into this place so easily. No offense, but I'd say the greater concern would be Arkham's ability to keep those from breaking out. Oh, it's not so bad in here, Bruce. Three squares. Good company. A complete absence of unnecessary pity from loved ones. Besides, if you saw as I do, you'd take the insanity within these walls over the true madness out there. Perhaps you're right. So, a bat? Huh. Interesting creatures, aren't they? Funny how one little winged rodent can mean so many different things to so many different people. If you ask me, it's all about their uncanny ability to maneuver in the dark. Like they embody a perception of the things that can't be seen. So, let me ask you. What do they mean to you, Bruce? Why a bat? Bats inspire fear, and criminals are superstitious and-- Cowardly lot, sure. I figured that's what you'd say. But is that really why? Well, something to think about, I guess. Okay then, down to business and the reason you've come. Do you know with whom you need to speak? I wish to speak to the spirit wrapped in flames. But you don't know who this spirit is? Only that it burns in hell. And you're sure you want to do this? It's not a question of want, Barbara. Spirit we seek, I surrender myself. Body and soul, come to us now. Come to us now. Come to us now! Father? It can't be. Hello, Bruce. What is this? It's me, son. And I am so, so sorry. Believe me, I wanted to tell you this when you were old enough. But not like this. Not here. Tell me what? I, Thomas Wayne, was born in 1585 and was among the first colonists to venture to the new world. I and others founded the settlement that would one day become Gotham. Lo, but those first years were unforgiving. The land penurious. The winters, harsh, indeed. We were dying. Until, one among us, Oswald Cobblepot discovered what was buried under the earth beneath our land. Myself, Bartly Langstrom, and Henry Queen followed Cobblepot into an ungodly place. He showed us the ancient book he'd found there. A book steeped in malevolence. Call it despair, call it desperation, call it, perhaps, even greed, but we four read from this book and performed its ceremonies most vile. Shame of which would last eons. But, alas, our settlement had been saved. Flourished, even. And not only did the four of us prosper beyond our wildest dreams, we'd been gifted apparent life eternal. In time, it was nearly as if we'd forgotten the events of that despicable night ever occurred. It, however, did not forget us. For centuries later, we would learn that the malevolence we bore that fateful night awoke him. Iog Sotha. It was our wretchedness that drew the thing to the threshold of our reality. You... called him forth. Knowing what we'd done, truly done, drove Bartly Langstrom to suicide, Oswald Cobblepot to the ends of the earth, and Henry Queen to... Well, worst yet, the curse lays the burden of undoing our misdeeds upon our children. The sins of the father are heaped upon the son. Yes. That's why Kirk Langstrom and Oliver both-- But it's not too late, son. You can stop this thing. Iog Sotha has not yet entered our realm. You must find the door before it fully opens. How? By becoming what you truly are. In coming to see me, you've accepted a world beyond reason and science. But you must embrace it. You must seek communion... With them. The bats. Thank you, Barbara. Thank you. You have returned. It is time for Iog-Sotha. Only the bat can face him. You understand what that means now, yes? I do. At last. You are prepared for this sacrifice? I am. Then now, you are one of us. Just tell me where to find the thing. Where it began. Harvey... Poison Ivy, I'm told. Considering a second opinion. Bruce? You take care of yourself. Huh? You too, Harv. I'll see you soon. Forgive me, boys. Thank God. Kick their ass, Bruce. Iog Sotha, I feel your power. Yes! I'd rather like to think that under different circumstances, we'd be allies... Friends, perhaps. My friends have a bad habit of dying. It's just you and me now. You fool. This thing... This thing is beyond your human comprehension. Behold. For even to gaze upon it is to incur madness! I've seen it. Do you not see? The deed is done. I am him. Born of the nameless mist, progenitor of Yib Nogeroth, Hastur the unspeakable... And Cthulhu himself! Die! For soon all that lives shall follow thee into Hell! Humanity shall be wiped from the earth! What is that? To prevail in this, Bruce Wayne must die and through death become himself. The bloodline can never escape the stain of sin... Why a bat? The bats know the way to salvation. You must embrace it. Now! You are now one of us. You're still alive? Not alive. Not anymore. What are you? I am Batman! Yes! Etrigan... Well done. The ledger is clear. Now take your leave, whilst I do my damage here. You must seek out two spirits. One wrapped in bats, the other in flames. A price is to be paid for your dark reign and so here for eternity in this hell you remain! Bruce Wayne must die, and through death, become himself. Before it can be truly saved, Gotham must be burned to the ground. Though this disaster struck only months ago, the Bruce Wayne memorial foundation has already begun to rebuild. A better Gotham is in reach. And we'd like to dedicate this effort to two dear friends of Mr. Wayne, and of Gotham itself. The honorable Harvey Dent and Mr. Oliver Queen. And now, the acting head of the foundation, Ms. Kai Li Cain. I've not been here long, but thanks to Bruce, I've come to think of Gotham as home. In many ways, my first home. Bruce Wayne had a vision of what Gotham could be. An ideal. I promise to do everything within my power, and beyond my power, to bring about the realization of Bruce Wayne's dream for a new Gotham City. Speaking of Bruce, for those of you who knew and loved him, take comfort in this final thought. He wasn't always the most forthcoming man, but you could always be sure of two things. He would do anything for those that he loved, and he was stubborn as hell. I know Bruce is watching over us. And something tells me that if we, the people and city that he held so dear, ever needed him, really needed him, not even death itself could keep him away.
