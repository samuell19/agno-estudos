This County of Limerick in Ireland in the year 1847. EXPLOSION OF PAIX ES In Ireland it seems simple that a woman kill a man or suicide committer And in Africa? "I'm a little more civilized." Would you like to dismount? "Why?" Your insanity hurt my horse. I'm sorry. In this case you want to continue and keep moving? Doubt -I do not. I finally got it I would say it was an insult. You are hosted on My home was two weeks ago. and did not say anything it was not about horses. I'm a guest of his father. I came to Ireland. to buy horses and not die because of on one. Come on, Mr. Van Riebeck. You'll want me to come. walking home? Yes, Miss. O'Neill I'll. K tia. My name is Katie. In South Africa, we say "K tia." Never think of anything not to be in South Africa? Yes. Right now I am. thinking that this is our dance. Goodbye dear. You're a murderer, K tia. A beautiful assassin and mortal. On here. Inside. -Tschaka. Yes, inkosi? -When will they be ready? Tomorrow, inkosi. So let's go. Okay, inkosi. Where were you? I've looked everywhere for you. I was paying for the horses. We were invited by Lady Vernon Let's go to her house on Saturday. Not Saturday? I'll be on my way to South Africa. Paul, I said we were going. "I have to go, K tia. Do you have to leave? Has? Is that it? -Well, it's not that simple. I could not stay a little more? By me. I'm sorry, K tia. Good... If it is important, I'll go with you South Africa. No, I could not. to live there. a difficult and desolate place, wild and indomitable. Do you think I'm easy? It can not be, K tia. Paul ... I do not care how difficult or worse. If I'm with you, I can live anywhere. I'm sure, K tia. But that's not all. So, what happens? (I.e. I belong to a single place to which I may belong. A nation that we try to build, a dream that we try accomplish. We call it Free State Holand s. I lead a group of warriors called "Commands". Our only place is the jungle and the mountains. We live thanks to our weapons and a dream. Once, I lived like you. in a good place like this in Cape Town. And left everything to fight. -Yes. This dream is all What interests you? Yes. Neither you nor me nor our lives? Nothing. I want to say goodbye Squire, and say thank you. Have a good day Someone leaving Ireland it's a bad day for those who stay. What happened? The potatoes are being attacked by the plague in the whole country. But you do not grow potatoes. In Ireland there are only two cultures: The potato and the hunger. Then find a understanding earth. There is land all over the world to cultivate one hundred crops. And now I come back to one of them? South Africa. Maybe I'm a little subjective with my country. Well, goodbye, Squire. Bye. May God bless you. Goodbye, Shawn. -Good luck. In six months, the plague destroyed the green of Ireland. With hunger comes fear, illness and death. My father was one of the first to go. His last words were equal to those of South Africa: "Look for a new land more understanding than this. " During the following year many things have happened. I married Shawn Kildare. We say goodbye Ireland. And during our long trip South Africa, our son was born. Let me see that, Aggie. Are you scared, Shawn? With you, no. as the end of the world. Or the beginning. Cape Town. It seems like a dream come true. of the "Thousand and One Nights", full of people, sounds and colors unknown. A new world, the world of Paul. Our arrival seemed a good press: new friends DeGroot family, that were so kind to take us to the city. What is all this? Prepare for the big journey to the Hoffen Valley. Why are you there? Terra, son. Terra gr tis. All for one man who wants to work. farmer? I was. -Then it's a land for you. The valley of Hoffen. Where is it? 1,200 kilometers. Hi, Jim. Ol , Maria. Hoffen pure nature but it will be our home. Are you going? -Yes. And the kids too. Is not it a bit dangerous? Everything is dangerous. It's complicated to cross Zulu territory, but it will escort us. Paul Van Riebeck and his commands meet us in the river. Van Riebeck? We met in Ireland. Himself. "And where is he?" Who knows. To the north, struggling. Nowhere, everywhere. But you will find us. Do you want to go? Well, it's a rich new land. Looks good. I want to go. But remember, no potatoes. Mrs. Degroot, can we go? Sure, if you want. What should we do to participate? Here comes Simon Hout, the leader of the caravan. He will say. Simon! Simon! -Maria! Jan! These are the Kildare, from Ireland. They want to join the caravan. Mr. Kildare. -Much pleasure. A pleasure. -Similarly. It's not as simple as it seems. I need equipment. A cart, oxen, weapons and provisions. I will do it. Can you ride, shoot, plow? I've done everything. It is a long and difficult journey. Some may not finish. Can we participate? Do you want to go to the headquarters now? Why not? -Go on. We'll wait here. Aggie, I forgot to ask you. -As always. Are you sure? What did you want, no? From the beginning. What you mean? "You know what I mean." This is what I like about you. You're sweet and modest. Stay that way while I'll. I do not have to stay. I will too. Maria DeGroot will go in the caravan and I will go with her, to stay with you. What's wrong? -Are you disappointed? No. Kurt! Kurt! Yes father? Examine the cars and let me know when ready to leave. Yes sir. Good Morning. Are you the wife of whom? My husband's. If you need anything, call me. Kurt Hout, leader of caravan. Have you ever traveled? in a caravan? No, never. It's very difficult. Yeah, that's what I'm told. "Do you ride?" I started riding from who was 6 years old. Be careful with the wheel lock. With what? You know what? lock wheel You mean that counterweight? In Ireland we call this of "Scottish bridle". Well, pay attention. Is important What they tell me. Now I am saying again. Excuse me, ma'am. Are they the Kildare? I'm one of them. We are the Joubert. We are in front of you. Then we'll see each other a lot. Shawn! Shawn! -Yes? These are our neighbors, the Joubert. Much pleasure. "Enchant, Monsieur." Also from a place far away? "From Ireland. We are from France. My father is 80 years old, but it looks younger. In France, I was a cook. In Africa, I want to be a good farmer. I was a good farmer but a bad cook. Then we will help each other. -Done deal. Are you ready, Kurt? Yes. Are you ready? How are you? can. In front! In front! In front! High! High! Stop! Let's rest! We are at the border of the Zulus lands. Did you see that? a Kraal Zulu. I hunted these two for you. Thank you, Kurt. You've been very kind to us. -With you. How far to arrive to Hoffen? Who knows? First the river and then the mountains. When will we find Van Riebeck? In the river. In front! In front! Get in the car. Let's cross! What do you think, Kurt? - What? Van Riebeck no. is waiting for us. He knows what he does. -I hope so. He always knew. Aggie, look at this. "Van Riebeck". I see a skull. An arrow that is pointing the way. So you're wrong. There are women. Let's go. There are no men, Simon. "Not even in the fields?" No. I counted 10 cars and the same in others. The men are gone. - It's weird. Maybe it has something to do with the absence of Riebeck in the river. Shawn. Shawn! Why not stop? The brakes! They're not holding it. Use the lock wheel, idiot. Stop it! Stop it! Dad! My God! May God receive your souls. Father Simon! What happened? Zulus! Thousands of them! Where? "Close by the river." To the north, two hours from here. We should warn Van Riebeck. I'll go after him. -No, we need you here. Pete, come back. Around the Zulus and Swallow Van Riebeck. Find it. -Yes father. Prepare them for the fight. Make shelter for children. Bring the oxen and crush the grass to avoid fire. Cut the thorny bushes and barricades below, around and beyond the cars Put them here and there and above. and also this car, to the top. He told thousands of them, Mary, thousands! And we only have 50 men. We have rifles and with one of these, I am like ten men. With a thousand Zulus creating problems, Van Riebeck will not be far. Pete will find you. "And if not?" So Paul will find us. We are in trouble and this It's something he always finds. No, no. One over the other. the cowhide leather the only thing for the wands. What? -Ladies, go and see them. Give me another skin. York, do not you have an assault rifle? -He lost it in his car. Joubert, do you want an assault rifle? It is a land of death. Here's something to die for. Katie, when they give the signal, put the baby in the shelter. Now come. I'll fight with your car. "Thank you, Kurt. No! Promised to fight with me! I can fight with you always. You're in love with her, so will fight next to her car. Kurt! -Kurt, enough! Enough. What do you think? is doing Come on, Julie. Come with me. She's like her. Smile and think To your lover. Is in love with you no matter how it is. Do not understand these women, Katie. I'm scared, Shawn. Suddenly, I'm scared. We all are, my dear. It's my fault. I should never have had it. brought to c . You did not bring me here, Katie, we came together. No matter how it ends. the important thing is that let's stay together The drums speak, inkosi. "Your people, Tschaka?" Not my people, inkosi. They are deserters, they fight with his own boss. How many? -The drums say many from the north. How many "many"? -Like the leaves of the trees. Wake them up. Hurry, hurry, let's go. Put the car down here. What are you doing? What does a cat do? with a mouse? Kurt! -Yes father? Let the men ride. Let's go. Joubert, get ready to fight. Let's offer peace, but prepare them to fight. Open the doors. Maria, how can you expect to win? 50 men and boys against an army of thousands. They're trying, K tia. Simon knows what to do. I'll say we've come in peace. to speak to his people. We do not ask for anything more. than peace. Everything they say : "Kill, kill, kill." Tell them that a messenger has been warn the commands and are on the way. They're retreating. I think we frightened them. Do not know how the Zulus fight Do you think he'll come back? I do not think so, I know. Come back. Come back and come back. until we kill them all. Or even kill us all. Carry the rifles and stay alert. Aggie! Aggie! Joubert. get down you crazy! Joubert! Shawn, Shawn ... Tschaka, take care of the horses and the muni o. We will attack the Zulus around the circle Ready? Let's go! Open the door on the south side! Riebeck comes with more muni o! Surround them, Paul. Surround them, Paul. You made them get away, Paul. You made them run away! Do not stop. Behind them. Chase them to the end of the world. Keep it up! K tia. Come on, it should not stay alone. There will be a meeting with the people. Our munition was running out. We were not going to last another hour. We knew it would come. Clear. I was sure of that. Of course yes. -You did. Paul! Paul! -Maria! My dear Maria. There are more that never. No, Aggie. Take him into the car. No. K tia O'Neill? Katia Kildare. Poor thing, your husband. died in the fight. Your husband? -Shawn. He was killed in the attack. K tia. - Paul. I just found out about Shawn. I feel. Yes. I could hardly believe it. You here in Africa fighting the Zulus. It's me. I'm glad to see you, K tia. Glad to see you, Paul. For all. You saved their lives. There are some. Let me see that, Aggie. Not the african do we know in Ireland? Yes. I suppose we should thank you for everything and for our lives. Do you know her? Yes, from Ireland. It's been a long time. told them to look for new land and now you're alone. No, Paul. I fought in your car. He almost left me to the Zulus. I would not have done it, my friend. You're taking us to Hoffen? -All the way. I cut you out, K tia. "Thank you, Kurt. Why did it go away? Cape Town? I told you about this. We wanted a free land, like everyone else. Was in Ireland For a long time, Paul? I do not remember well. Bought some horses from my father. Just the view. There will be a place in government when we create the Free State. No, thank you. I'm already fed up with struggles and politics. I do not want to build a state and yes, a house. I want to lean on something that is not a weapon. We'll lay down the guns and build when we finish. Finish it yourself. -I will do this. There is nothing else in your life? Do not you think of anything else? At the moment, no. Well, I do. Hoffen! Hoffen! Does not that sound right? I would say too early. Never too early to live and maybe it's not very late. Katie ... K tia, you will have all men at your feet and all women against you. Katie, you look beautiful. Do you want to dance with me? Well, Kurt, it's not going. invite me to dance? I already invited. How's Paul doing? -Good. I have to talk to you. -Not here. We're stopping dancing. Let's go. No, until you tell me Tell me what I want to know. I'll see you in your car. Aggie and the child are sleeping there. Let's take a walk. Why have you been? avoiding me? Look, this is not Ireland. South Africa and Kurt is my friend. And what Kurt has to do thereby? He fought in his car. Here, when a man does that means something. Did not mean anything for me. Shawn fought in my car. and died in it. that meant something. Tschaka, wait here. Kurt, you know what? Do you feel it? I do not know what you know or what do you think Whatever. I want to know what you think. I want to know, Paul. Why did you come to South Africa? You did not tell me, "Leave Ireland. and seek a new land "? Yes, well ... Australia. a new land, America. Why did you come to South Africa? For your cause. By me? He married Shawn, drew him to C, he and his son, for me? Were you surprised? Do not you think you should? "I do not know what to think. Can I tell you what love is? Does anyone know? He loved Shawn. I thought it was just a memory. He was right. I thought that if I saw you again, could look, smile and be happy. Was wrong. I can not. When I saw him, I knew that I wanted you and nothing more. All these years, everything that I have done, it was for you, to find it, to be together with you, If I was wrong, it was myself. If you were mean and unfair, So have I been. I love him and all that I know. K tia. -No. Now I ask you. What am I to you? Am I just another woman? I'm someone I met and kissed without thinking? I'm someone you could abandon without looking back? I should know, Paul. It's been easy for you No. It was not easy to leave her in Ireland. and come back to my life and try to follow as before you know it. You think you've been easy these weeks, with you on one side of the caravan Me in another and Kurt in the middle? I tried to fill the void with work and violence. I tried to pull it off my thoughts. And it has been possible, but no I could go on like this all my life. Beautiful Africa is even more beautiful. of what he had told me. Choose the land, I want ... Liars. You two are fake. They deceived me. No one tricked you. -Nobody will not do it again. You made a mistake. Do not make another. "I have not done anything that can not be corrected." Listen to me. Inkosi! Kurt! Paul! Kurt! I feel. He will. Well, what do you think? It's wonderful. How much land does it belong to me? Anything that may cover the horse in half a day. Where would you like to build the house? There, across the river. I want to start with 4 rooms. -Four? Just it? No salt of dance and no cellar? Someday we'll have everything. "Two will suffice to begin. I love you. It's enough that we have these two bedrooms, we will live under that magnificent tree. What's your home's name? in Cape Town? Abend Bloem. "The Flower of the Moon"? So this will be our Abend Bloem. Here we will pass our lives. This is our house, our place. What are these beams for? To the ceiling? No, it's for the walls. It's easier to build a ceiling above the house than a house under the roof. One day this will be a mansion. and we will have miles of land. An im- we will govern together. Is that what you want? "And you, no?" No. -What do you want? Release it. Our land and the of all. What happens? I do not know. I love this time. The hour that the angel calls, when everything is quiet. I once said that a woman like me, could not live here. Remember? I was wrong. I do not know if you were right. or not. Had never been I'm tired I am dead. Wait. Leave me. How nice. Lower. More up. Small children. They're magic. Are you just saying? to stop. Paul. Happy? Happy? - I mean, with me. You know that. Say it. It's fine, I will say. I do not know what he does, but not respectable. It is bad spirits. With or without spirits I'm going to sit down now. I can not keep the men united. I'm not your leader, you are. It will be for a little while, Christian. - It's been three months. It's been a long time for a man live your life For you, . Without you, the Command is nothing. Without their leader they are debating. Okay, I'll be. there tomorrow He said that you have what to go, no? Yes. And what did you say? They depend on me, K tia. I also depend on you. Yes, but more than that. More than you and me. Have you been unhappy with me? -You know you do not. Is not enough? Is not that what really matters? I will not let you go, ever, for nothing in this world. No, I do not want to hear. I love you, I love you and I will never leave you. Bye. - Goodbye, Paul. With God's help, your mission will succeed We all pray for a Free State Holand s. It may take six months. It may take a year. But when I'm done, I'll be back. Speak, Simon. Talk to K tia. -I will speak. I hate him for it. I hate him. Ready? Forward! K tia! -Maria. Good to see you! I was worried about you. It's clear. Are you sick? -No, I'm fine. How are you, Kurt? Aggie, Mary is here! Welcome, Maria. Happy, the eyes that see you. We have nothing to talk about. You should see the Terence grew up. Come in and see the boy, Aggie. -He's handsome. You will not recognize it. It's been so long and he grew so much. Glad to see you, Kurt. I could have done better. -Clear. I can also plow better. that they, with their eyes closed. I know. Must be the best farmer on this side of the country. I often wondered as you were. I was offered to attend of the Free State Council. Good, congratulations. Kurt, do you know any farmer? Anyone looking for a good place? I would share the harvest with him. -No. He hopes that Van Riebeck come back, no I do not expect anything. So I'll wait for you. I'll work here. I'll show you the man I am. -Kurt. I am the man for you. And when you finish planting, You will say the same. Kurt! Kurt, dinner is ready. "Thank you, Katie. Pass. Aggie, you will sit here. And me here. Kurt, you can stay on the headboard. Why are you here? I asked Maria to help us. There's a lot of work. "I do not want it here." Julie will stay, Kurt. You do not need Julie. We made a deal, You and me. I'll keep my part. More grandsons, Jantsie. No, Kurt! Stop! Stop! Do not touch this tree. With so much shadow, nothing will grow. I have to pull it off. This tree is. To my land and I will do what I want. It's fine. I will not touch your Abend Bloem still. Yes, Aggie told me. Prove some of it. You work too hard. I am fine. Tomorrow, or the other day, when they finish planting, She will send you away. Can not you hear me? Do not believe it? You're fooling around. No one will come back fool me. Julie, come on. I need you. Kurt, the storm scares the oxen, who do not leave. Aggie! What? What are you going to do? Be careful! Watch out! I told you that I did not want to cut it off! I know what it means. I made this place habitable for you and I'm going to take it out of your life. Now to mine. Kurt, let's talk that tomorrow. Let's go back home, A storm is coming. I beg you gently. -Now no. Yes now. I dug and I sweated for you. I fulfilled my part, now it's your turn. No! I said now. No, Kurt. It's impossible Why? Why? I'm going to have a baby. From who? From Shawn? From Paul? Or invented this for fool me. It's a lie to get rid of me. You are a liar and a cheater. Help! Help me! Help! Help! Kurt! Help me, get help! No! The pieces! Call the dogs! Aggie! Aggie, help! Help! Aggie, help! Let's try more once, stronger. Watch out! Watch out! Be careful. Carefully. Caution Aggie! Shut up! We have to decide now. We need more light. Julie, look for more candles. Jantsie! Jantsie! Yes ma'am? Come quickly. It's possible to go To the village? No, the river. It's too full. We have to cut the leg or die. " You have to do this, Jantsie. I do not like this man. Do this for me. For you, yes. And now, the what will we do? When the river goes down, we'll take Kurt to Hoffen. The doctor will tell me when I will have my baby. And us? What will we do then? Then we will return to plowing and sowing. We will start all over again. My baby was born. I'll call him Paul. It was a name I always wanted. We work to rebuild the farm. It was slow, cruel, unbearable One day, months later, We went to Hoffen. Hi. Good morning. How are you, Mrs. Kildare? Good morning, Simon. Aggie. -Good Morning. How's Kurt doing? It's not all right. It's very bad. How is the baby? Strong as your Irish ancestors. -Good. Come in Shuman's car. This last time I accept Dutch money. Next time I want to that they pay me in gold.

Waiting to trade your gold for their frets. I hope you like the I have. Next time, I'll trade with you two. Give them the welcome. Jantsie, tell me what I change this for his gold. He said it was not enough, who came from far away. Tell him he's a thief. Wait. It's a thief! Who else has gold, Jantsie? This man said no It has gold, but it has it. Do you like it? Yes if that's what I think , You like it a lot. Give him everything I have. Let's start all over again, but not here. We are going to the city. the Cape. Let's live! Let's teach them how to the Irish live! Good... assuming it's a diamond ... It was a diamond, one of the largest in South Africa. I sold the diamond and with the money I settled in Cape Town. I would have the life I always I dreamed a house, properties and one position. Even though I had my children, I was For years, I went to the places that Paul knew. I tried to listen to some thing about it. The money he spent freely did not bring me happiness. In South Africa, the dream of a Free State Holand s in the end it came true, but for the Dutch still there was a battle to win. They wanted to have a representative the National Assembly of Cape Town. Commander Van Riebeck. - Captain Eaton's waiting for you. Commander Van Riebeck, sir. Captain Eaton. "Good morning, Commander. I'm sorry to tell you this, but the Governor will not see you. I repeat that I will not say so to my people. But, my lord, we already recognize its existence as a state. Why are not you satisfied?

I will not go to Cape Town. without seeing the Governor. Good Morning. -Just a moment. I heard that you a very stubborn man. Yes?

You have changed, K tia. Truth? It's even more beautiful than that I remembered if that is possible. Abend Bloem has also changed. She was beautiful again. As it was? "As it was a long time ago."
