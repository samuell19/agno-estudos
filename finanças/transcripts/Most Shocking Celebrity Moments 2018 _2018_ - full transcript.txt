The world is shocking. So, a lot of it is fake news, I hate to say. # Worn out places, worn out faces... Parliament is paralysed. It's being stuck in a rut. # It's a very, very # Mad world... # If only there was something - anything to take our minds off our imminent descent into the Armageddon abyss. Oh, hang on a minute. Is that Justin Bieber? Bieber's back! And look, it's Kanye! He's God now, is he? And the GC? Everyone's going to be shocked when they see me. Could it be possible, there's a whole host of celebs waiting in the wings? Very intriguing. Ready to turn out for the one, the only, the downright legendary... Oh, my God, I can't believe it. ...Most Shocking Celebrity Moments 2019? It's epic! Yes, dear friends and shop fans, we are back! All sparkly and new... SHE VOCALISES ...right here, right now for your viewing pleasure. We've got the usual old timers... Yeah. Oh, stop it, you pervert! ...and some rookies. I watch these shows every single Christmas. I'm on one now. It's crazy. You most certainly are. Wow. And so are you, Kim Kardashian... ...and you, Meghan and Harry, and Sheryl, Rihanna, Miley. I cannot actually believe what I'm seeing. So, whether you're at home... I think the letters H-O-M-E are so important. ...away... ...or at a straightforward shooting weekend... If at first you don't succeed, try again, they say. He is a toxic prince now. # It's the end of the world as we know it... Don't go anywhere. I'd rather be dead in a ditch. Cos the world may be going to hell in a handcart... Everyone's losing their minds! ...we may be in the gutter... SHE RETCH ES ...but some of us are looking at the stars. HORN HONKS SCREAMING Kicking us off... # Prima donna girl... GU.! What would our list be without Gemma falling over somewhere? Yeah. # Prima donna girl... What, indeed? And this year, everyone's favourite vertically-challenged reality star... I am, I am, I am, yeah. ...was at it again. Just think Beyonce on ice, honey. Well... # Living life like I'm in a dream... She had probably most memorable moments of the show. Everyone's going to be shocked when they see me. Oh, we were, Gemma. No-one brought more sass than Gemma did to the ice, let's be honest. And in Week 4, the GC nearly ended up in A&E when she fell A-over-♪ on DOI. 0_M_G! She just goes... HE GASPS Straight down, hit the deck. HE LAUGHS Right on her chops. How she didn't end up taking her teeth home in a carrier bag, I will never know. I know how hard that ice is, and when you go face-first... ...I'm telling you, it's awful. I just remember thinking, "Oh, no, Gem, get up, get up, get up". However, when she got backstage, I heard the first thing she said was, "That was TV gold, babes! Wasn't it? That was TV gold! "It's going to be everywhere! "I am Dancing On Ice-" Along with the ice, the GC also collided with Judge Jason Gardiner, after a particularly frosty critique. When you know your friend this well, you can tell by people's facial expressions when someone's going to go. And I was sat there, looking at the screen, and I thought, "Jason, do yourself a favour, shut up, because" - it sank in her eyes. And I was like, "GC is going to come out in full mode". And... she absolutely did. May I just say one thing? Maybe if you didn't sell stories on me, I wouldn't have been so upset this week. CROWD EXCLAIMS So take that! Boring! Boring! See, that's another iconic moment - Gemma giving it straight back to Jason. # Bring me sunshine # In your smile... # SHE EXHALES We just sort sat there, like... "This isn't a rehearsal, is it?" Oh, my God, she's actually doing this live on TV. Don't sell stories on me. Don't sell stories on me. Do not sell stories on me. All right, all right, thank you. "Don't sell stories. Don't sell stories, though. "Don't sell stories, though. "But... don't sell stories, though." You just see Schofield like... SPUTTERS "..moving on, actually." HE LAUGHS And Phil's just like, "Oh, my God. "Is this an episode of Catherine Tate?" It wasn't Catherine Tate, but Gemma certainly wasn't "bovvered" - especially when it came to time-keeping. Because at one point, they all had to wait ten minutes. And Prince Pip Schofield himself said, "Even I - even I, in "all my years of TV, have never kept a crew waiting for ten minutes". She's not just a diva for the screens, trust me. Live with it. Yeah. That should go down in history. # It must've been love # But it's over now... Oh, no! It's Jennifer Aniston. Who's broken her heart this time? RECORD SCRATCH Oh, sorry, our mistake! Jen has made the shock list again - but this year... Oh, my God, I can't believe it. # Let me take a same... ...it's for a completely different reason. Congratulations to Jennifer Aniston. She got on Instagram. Something she'd never done before. She broke the Internet. Jennifer Aniston - in five hours, 16 seconds - managed to get a million followers, taking the record from Meghan Markle and Prince Harry. That is real star power. All that star power blew a fuse on the Internet. At least, that's how we think it works. And her page went down for a few hours. And then, it was all gone, and we were like, "Oh, was that a mistake? "What happened?" And then, it was back. Miss Anniston! Jen responded to all the lnsta interest on jimmy Kimmel Live, appearing to downplay the fuss with her typical comedy deadpan answers. You've gotten to a million, like... I don't know, 12 seconds, or something like that? Yeah. You are - yeah, you don't do that kind of stuff. You do now. Why are you doing it now? LAUGHTER Jennifer, look up! Look up, Jennifer! So, what was the photo that broke the Internet? Jennifer Aniston has joined Instagram, and the first photo - iconic, it's all the Friends stars. Ooh, reunion! Hey. Jen? Yes? Oh... SHE LAUGHS This is very intriguing. Rumour mill was like, "Right, is this a reunion? "Are we going to get a film?" I'm sat there on tenterhooks. Heard no more! "ls there a film? ls there another series?" What's going on, Jen? What IS going on? And more importantly, willjen ever find love? I've always fancied her. Don't tell the GC. HE LAUGHS # When will I, will I be famous... I loved Bros. They were massive, they were like - everybody went through his hysteria. # Will I be famous... # Boys wanted to be them. Girls wanted to be with them. They were a big deal. We are young, but we're still artists. And we started when we were 11. Then they just disappeared for years and years. But 30 years on, it was good news for Brosettes - the boys were making a comeback. Yay! So, they decide to make a documentary as they lead up to their first arena performance in 30 years. I love the Bros documentary. Everybody was talking about the Bros documentary. This was TV gold! It so was! And in After The Screaming Stops, we got to see just how close the boys were. So supportive, full of love for each other. RECORD SCRATCH You don't have to fucking swear at everybody, just fucking - otherwise, I'll fucking swear all the fucking time. Awkward. Everybody's listening. That's the first commercial argument of rehearsals, that's part of it. They were just really jealous of each other, I think, there was just this kind of... "No, I'm better than you. "No, I'm better than you." And ultimately, they're brothers - and twins. Both in their own way - they're both as bad as each other. You're going to speak, are you? You're going to speak? Cos I just told you how I feel. Go fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself. If the fighting was bad, the talking bits were - how can we put this - hilarious. But some of the shit that Matt Goss was coming out with. I think the letters H-O-M-E are so important, because they... ...personify the word "home". If you asked me what the letters H-O-M-E spell... ...they spell home. I made a conscious decision, because of Stevie Wonder, to not be superstitious. But Stevie Wonder's VERY supers... He's literally very superstitious. Here is the little, kind of, conversation corner. Er... Matt so seriously, walking around his house, showing it, like, "This is conversation corner, and, er, er" - has nothing to say. There's no conversation to be had. Er... er... er... Every home should have a conversation corner - H-O-M-E, that is. This one actually gives the illusion of... pyros - pyros falling down everywhere. They are pyros. No, they really are. They are pyros. OK, so... all right. The illusion of real pyros. You have to watch this documentary, because it is one of the funniest things you will ever see. This is us coming back to life, and what a way to come back to life. Me, too, mate. # When will I, will I be famous... # # In the shallow, shallow... It is the ultimate story of love, romance, passion - and the film wasn't bad, either. We knew that A Star ls Born is an incredibly romantic tale. So, there were already rumours in preproduction of this film that Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga were spending an incredible amount of time together - don't forget, he's the director. In the film, their chemistry zinged off the screen. Gaga's song "Shallow" picked up two Grammies, a Golden Globe, and an Academy Award. But it was her and Brad's rendition of the theme tune that really got tongues wagging. # In the shallow, shallow # In the shall-shall-la-shallow... # In the shallow, shallow... # In the shall... # ..low # In the sha-ya-ya... # ..low... # Would you go to bed with me? No-one even cared about who won an Oscar. Nobody gave a shit. It was all about the fact that Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga were definitely doing things with each other. Or really wanted to do stuff with each other - like, a lot. Loads. And the Twitter-atti agreed. A lot. Loads! Please say hello to Lady Gaga! Before Gaga went on jimmy Kimmel Live to shoot down any romance rumours - playing it earnest and genuinely flummoxed. Yes. # P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face... # To add insult to awkwardness, Brad's girlfriend, Irina Shayk, was sitting in the audience watching. The Best Actress award goes to Irina, Bradley Cooper's missus, for just pretending to be OK about it all. If my husband was up there with anybody, I would have gone up there and absolutely, I would've grabbed that hair and all banged her face on that piano. L'd've been playing the piano with her head! Irina refrained from inflicting any musical injuries, but the relationship certainly took a battering. Now Gaga and Bradders are both single, might they actually get together? The real question is, are they fucking or not? 100% they fucked. Ooh, I say! 100%. And now... the Archangel Gwynnie. How we've missed you! And how lucky are we that the divine Miss P cares so much about us that he shares her pearls of wisdom so we can live our best lives? Hello! Hi. How are you all? NARRATOR GIGGLES SHEEPISHLY: Fine, thanks. Gwyneth Paltrow's entire job description these days is just to make the rest of us feel deeply inadequate about ourselves. She has surpassed herself this year. Yup - this year, our shameless shaman shock is how to manage our marriages. Gwyneth Paltrow advocates a part-time marriage. It's quite a clever way, I think, of gradually entwining what they call these days a "blended" family. Gorgeous Gwyn only entwined with husband Brad four clays a week. He selflessly sacrifices the other three to be with his kids. A high price to pay. # Part-time lover... # Because he's got the kids, and she's got the kids, and she's got the unconscious coupling to manage still. Oh, yes, remember that? Oh, dear. Enough to make anyone... SHE RETCHES Now, now! If ex-hubby Chris Martin is OK with it - enough to go on Gwyneth and Brad's honeymoon with them - then it's fine by us. Anyway, back to Brad. They came up with this deal where - I think he stays over perhaps 2-3 nights a week, and the rest of the time, they do their thing. Oh. yes'? Surely not. I mean, what's to hate about a woman who employs an intimacy teacher? Just one more vital character on Planet Paltrow. Hands up, who else has got one? Anyone? I don't have an intimate coach, but I'm thinking maybe I need to get one. If you want to be Paltrow-perfect, and what the teacher advises in marriage is polarity. I'm sorry, does it really work to only have your husband part-time? Like, it's really weird. Surely you get married because you can't be apart? SLIDE WHISTLE So, what do I do for the other three days, then? Stay tuned, we've only just begun. And if you turn over, you'll miss this. I never thought you'd do this to me. Welcome back to the show that's officially identifying as a countdown of Most Shocking Celebrity Moments. I watch these shows every single Christmas. The fact that I'm on one now - it's crazy. It's crazy. Isn't it? And this summer, we couldn't get enough of Amy and her fellow Love Islanders all searching for that special someone. I went in there to meet someone and to fall in love, to marry and have children with, and stuff. It's a free holiday and an incredible time, and you could potentially fall in love. Curtis was the only one for me in that villa. And just nine clays in, Curtis popped the question that every Cinderella wants to hear. Will you be my half-girlfriend? SHE LAUGHS I will be your half-girlfriend. Cos I was so open to it... ...I think that's why I did fall in love with him. And everyone goes, "It was only four weeks" - you spend every minute, 720 hours, before we went to Casa Amer. Oh, yes, Casa Amor - the destroyer of dreams. It's head-turning central. And Curtis, who, you know, has been the good, loyal boyfriend, you know - oh, sorry, half-boyfriend - had his head turned by another girl. And that girl was newbie Jourdan. You are clearly stunning, I'm not going to lie. But having been knocked back, Curtis made a big decision at the re-coupling ceremony. Oh, the old half-romantic. I'd 100% like to stick with Amy. But then, I got back, obviously, walked in, saw him on his own, breathed a huge sigh of relief. Yeah. Made absolute mug of myself by doing that, like, little speech. The girls are sick of me, because all I've - I've been that girl on the girls holiday that's like, "I really miss him". And Caroline Flack was squeezing my hand, which now I know to be a sign for "shut up"... SHE LAUGHS ...because he's mugged you right off. "And I've missed you so much." And he went... She sat up like... "What the hell is going on"? Curtis sat her down to tell her exactly what the hell had gone on. I asked her to re-couple, she said no. I said I was going to continue pursuing her. And then, I realised that it was the wrong thing to do. I was coming back here to tell you that I loved you. "I was going to tell you that I love you." And I was thinking, "Why? You're an idiot." 'u. ...can't believe you've done that - I never thought you'd do this to me. You're the perfect man, after all. You're the perfect man. You're fucking not. The villa does weird things to you. In real life, if someone said after for weeks, "Don't want to see "any more, you'd be like, "All right, that's fine". But I - like, I've been sold this dream. And then, it was... away. SHE WHOOSHES I thought I'd met my first love, and the one. And it turns out, I haven't. I'm someone's backup plan yet again. #No, I # Don't want to fall in love... But, yes, that was quite hard that night. # No, I... # The key moment for Amy, though, was when she walked away. I will be leaving the villa... once I pack my case. TEARFULLY: I love you all so much. And I cannot tell you what you've all done for me. I wasn't going to meet anyone else, so I was like, "literally it's pointless, me being here, I might as well go home". So, Amy, any regrets about your Prince Not-So-Charming? Hindsight's a wonderful thing. And I am not sure we would have worked well as I thought we would've done on the outside. Shocker. Since time began, religion has played a major part in many lives. We're nothing if not God-fearing here at Shock Towers. And you know who else is a big, old God-botherer? Kanye West. HE LAUGHS Hell, yeah. Just when you thought there was nothing else Kanye West could actually do to surprise us, he's become a vicar. Hallelujah! In 2019, Kanye invented his very own church. He's called his Sunday Service. Looks very jolly, doesn't it? This is the weirdest shit in the world. Yes, it is a tad unorthodox. So far, the service has popped up in LA, New York, and celeb-fest Coachella - where he appeared to recreate the sermon on the mount. Right, talk me through it again - he's God now, is he? Did I miss that? # I am a god... You have to wonder how much of the Sunday Service is a legitimate attempt to connect with a higher power, and how much of it is him basking in all these people who are worshipping Kanye? # Hurry up with my damn croissants... # Speaking of breakfast, Kanye's disciples don't go hungry - for like Jesus feeding the 5,000, Yeezy is offering up brunch! Here it is, yours for the bargain price of $55. Yummy! If anything's going to turn you against God... ...it's going to be getting that bacon at that Sunday Service with Kanye West. Not even a cup of tea. HE LAUGHS Actually, he isn't Kanye any more. I might legally change my name to Christian Genius Billionaire Kanye West. Rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? And let's not forget Mrs Christian Genius Billionaire Kanye West. She's becoming a lawyer! Honestly, we're not making it up. I actually would take legal advice for Kim. I think she is super, super smart. It's really important to me to get my law degree, and to really stick it through. I'm almost done with year one. In California state, you don't have to go to college or law school to pass the bar exam and be a lawyer. Kim was going to take what's called a "baby bar". Talking of which - babies, that is - number four was on the way via another surrogate. I don't really have time for that any more. But selfishly, the due date looked like it was going to clash with one of Kim's favourite outings - the Met Gala. Decisions, decisions! It was outrageous, Kim debating not being there when her baby was born, because she had the Met Gala. And the fact that she had to be there to wear the corset that made her look like she was going to die at any moment versus going to the birth of her baby. Kim managed to squeeze in both events - and lo, they named the child Psalm. So, there you have it. Whatever will these two get up to next? Not laughing, Kanye. Not laughing at all. Hello. I always think, if we do something that can provoke other people to have a discussion, then that's definitely a good thing. Oh, you provoked a discussion, all right. SHE LAUGHS For decades now, Lovely Lorraine Kelly has been, well, lovely. Lovely. But not any more! Lorraine Kelly the person, and Lorraine Kelly the character that she plays on television, liking everything bubbly - they're not necessarily the same person. I think it's just cos I've been around so long. The Esther McVey thing with Lorraine Kelly was so shocking. In June, Tory politician Esther McVey was being interviewed on GMB during her campaign to become party leader. Esther McVey, thank you very much, indeed. Lorraine Kelly's here. Do you remember Esther McVey from her GMTV days? THEY LAUGH Lorraine, the sweetest presenter on TV - suddenly we realise she's got a really harsh side. And that whole interview with Esther McVey was so uncomfortable. "Mm-hm. Yeah." Oh... and everyone's like, "Oh, do you remember her"? "Yeah." Why does Lorraine Kelly hate Esther McVey? Well, Esther herself gave a possible reason. We used to share a dressing room, so - and she used to be the programme afterwards. And obviously, she used to be partnered with Eamonn Holmes. And then, I was promoted to be partnering with Eamonn Holmes. It's weird, what gets them - what gets people's attention. It's quite funny. We all saw Lorraine having a bit of a growl at Esther McVey. But the whole thing with Jennifer Arcuri took us a whole new level. And it was so shocking. Is this the new Lorraine? It was just another day on Good Morning Britain. And in the hot seat was Jennifer Arcuri being grilled by Piers and Susanna about her relationship with Bojo. So, in a positively toe-curling outburst, the all-new straight-talking Lorraine Kelly struck again with a show of exasperation that spoke for the nation. God, that was crazy, wasn't it? That was - what's the point? Come down, not answer any questions? Point, that? Anyway, and... SHE CHUCKLES No, it's just me. What's the point of you coming down, and then, not saying anything? I'm sorry? What is the point of you coming on the TV to clear the air, and then, you don't say anything? Why - I believe I said a few things. What - what is it that you were looking for that I say? Well, you didn't answer any of the questions that... were put to you. I just don't see the point of you coming on, to be honest. Anyway... I really think people will get that as their ringtone. "I mean, what's the point? What's the point?" Time to celebrate now with the nation's sweetheart, Cheryl Cole Fernandez-Versini-Doodah, make an amazing comeback with her single Let You reaching the giddy height of number 57 in the Hit Parade! Oh, no! 57? Oh, bless 'em. That's right - 57! One less than 58. The problem Cheryl's got is that at one time she was the most important pop star in Britain. She doesn't have the clout that she used to have either on television or in music. That is disappointing for her. You didn't do anything, pet. You're terrific. Although you did say last year you'd quit releasing music if you had another flop. Probably just a blip. Her songs are rubbish. She just needs to just stop already. The sort of pop star she was depends on you being like a young, sexy thing. I think when you're a mum of one, you can't be Dua Lipa, like, arsing about the Brits with your bum-cheeks out, like, that's not going to work. Hmm, maybe her comeback hasn't been that great. No, 57's still pretty good, isn't it? I met her recently. She seemed in a really good place. Exactly. And only 56 other songs were higher up. Oh, hurry up. I'm going to download 50-odd times and kind of do all I can to get her back into that top ten. Good on ya. With that attitude, Chez definitely has a long musical career ahead of her. She could become, like, you know, agony aunt. We were thinking more about her fine musical abilities. And while we're waiting for the reunion tour, we can all be happy in the knowledge that whenever we need our Cheryl fix, we can just head along to Madame Tussauds. Oh, no, what a pity. Stop all the clocks Cut off the telephone For this year saw the end Of Game of Throne... s. Yeah, so Game of Thrones ended. Obviously very sad for a lot of people. It was the biggest show in the world. The biggest show that the television had ever, ever seen. Great show. It was an epic bit of TV and I loved the way it ended and I loved the way that Denise Targaryen just went mad. No-one saw that coming and it was very compelling to watch. It had been written in the stars since the day dot - the Targaryens are fucking batshit. They're incestuous kind of lunatics crazed on power. That is that is the story of the Targaryens, so for anyone to be surprised that Daenerys started going a bit... HE GROANS ...is not all there themselves. It was always going to end like that. Yes, fans, plus whoever this guy is, were divided by the dramatic series finale. If you're going to make your TV show trend, annoy the keyboard warriors, and that's what they did by taking quite a nice character and making her into a mass-murdering fuckhead. It was an incredible moment, just seeing that happen and thinking, "Oh, they're not going to like this." To complain about how a fictional television show ends is like howling at the moon. There is no fucking point in it. "She would never do that! "She was a nice person for nine years! Why?!" "Dear the internet..." The fans were devastated, but Jon Snow, AKA Kit Harington, who'd lived and breathed the show for eight years, ended up checking into rehab for alcohol and stress issues. It must have been tough for him to realise that this huge part of his career in his life was over and that he's going to spend the rest of his life at conventions, meeting the fans who are all going to say to him, "Why did she go on a killing spree?! "She would never have done that! Dear Kit..." "I'm in the flesh." "I don't care, I can only talk to you like this!" Isn't the point that he isn't any more? The end. There's Romeo and Juliet, you know, there's Troilus and Cressida, and then you had Paul Hollywood and Summer Monteys-Fullam. Not any more. If it weren't shocking enough that the 52-year-old Master Baker was dating a 22-year-old, a bigger shock came when their relationship curdled and split in a rather spectacular fashion. Paul Hollywood. He's got fast cars so he had to get a young girl. And they said it wouldn't last and it didn't. Paul split from wife of 20 years, Alex, in 2017 and the baps expert then fell into Summer's arms, but it was she who dumped him. Paul Hollywood's one-time girlfriend and regular crop-top-wearer, Summer, somehow, quite to her credit, had refused to sign an NDA during their relationship. # Don't speak # I know just what you're sayin'... # It would take me to be dating Tom Cruise, I think, to sign an NDA. Paul Hollywood isn't Tom Cruise. Come on now. It was a stretch, really, to believe that these two were kindred spirits. Ironically, by trying and failing to get an NDA, details of the couple's relationship went more and more public as they became more and more acrimonious. It was one of those classic cases where what was love has turned to wrath, and it was plastered all across the tabloids for everyone to see. He tried to sort of deny there was a document. She came back and she said she was going to have to take legal proceedings against Paul for denying there was a document. There were claims of controlling behaviour and of fake, stalking Instagram accounts. And then she went on to say that he had accused her of courting the press and he'd accused her of spilling secrets about him and that she hadn't done anything of the sort. Nothing happened. It's all been blown up slightly out of proportion. She had done an awful lot of wiggling around in very, very tight ♪-shirts and being photographed doing so, but, you know, who doesn't? HONK! The news of Paul and Summer's sad parting had come just clays after his divorce from wife, Alex, who had once been a fan of his refined foodie palate. I'll sneak off and go and have a dirty kebab or stop off at a takeaway. There's definitely one place he no longer goes to for his weekly shop. Shit, imagine getting your little Percy Pigs and someone's slutting and whoring round the corner. You don't expect it in Marks's, do ya? TANNOY JINGLE TANNOY: Could the Hollywood party please stop slutting and whoring and leave the building? Thank you. Stay tuned to find out, who is international woman of mystery? I'm going to say Celine Dion. Welcome back to the show that's shockier than a princely visit to a pizza emporium. And now, one of the biggest mysteries of 2019. Who IS that girl? She looks a bit like Queen Elizabeth, the silhouette. If you have a look... Not her... in the Land Rover, going hunting in the rose garden, so she's completely camouflaged. I'm going to say Celine Dion. Nope. Curtains. Like Grandma's curtain. Oh, it's Cardi B. No, no, (larch B. # They call me Cardi B # I run this shit like cardio... # It was our favourite shocking ex-stripper-rapper at Paris Fashion Week. Cardi B is one of those people that, as a red carpet reporter, you silently thank the gods that she's going to be there. But Why?! It makes headlines, darling. That is not fashion. That is horrific. How did she see? She's walking across the road with a full floral mask on. Only Cardi B. I love her. And we love her, too, especially when she turns up to award shows dressed as a mollusc. Wow, that's a beautiful outfit, and Cardi B is making a big statement. Cardi B's outfits are like installations. That black and pink outfit just looked like a shell had given birth to her. But she can't have a glass of red wine. I don't know how much you'd enjoy yourself on a night out wearing that, but you're not wearing it to enjoy yourself, are you? You're wearing it so we talk about it - and we are! Hooray for Cardi B, hooray. And hooray for when she rocked up in this frock at the Met Gala cos Cardi's never fully dressed without ruby nipples. Oh, that's cool. This dress took a whopping 2,000 hours to make. Time well spent, we say. I love that Cardi B wore that giant maroon quilt to the Met. Can you imagine having to get into an outfit like that? Having like 20 people have to sort you out. And then your armpits are getting sweaty and then you're worried about, "Oh, is that going to like affect it." And they go, "Oh, that's OK, darling, I've got a pant liner I can put under there for you." And then like, "Oh, what should we do with the nipples?" And it's... Oh, God, what a faff. I love her. It's epic. Lewis Capaldi, what a year for him. He's broken records in the music industry, but more than that, he's got such a good sense of humour. The 23-year-old Scot's breakthrough single, Someone To Love, charted in 29 countries and topped the UK Singles Chart for seven weeks. Despite this, he's not to everyone's taste. He's a man with a guitar singing songs. Imagine James Blunt, but without the privilege. You might think that's putting it bluntly... ...but someone else really doesn't mince his words. The rock and roll shake up of the year kicked off in June in an interview with Noel Gallagher, who in traditional irascible form, spat out an unprompted and totally over-the-top rant, which stunned everyone. Yeah, but not recently. Music is fucking wank at the moment. Who's this Capaldi fellow? Lewis Capaldi? Who the fuck's that idiot? He is... I'm going to stand up for him. Yes. I thought he was slagging off Doctor... The bloke who played Doctor Who. I did as well. No, that's Peter Capaldi, his second cousin once removed. Not one for time travel, Lewis responded the very next day in a chirpy post that amazed people with his positive take on it. Noel Gallagher... ...has just slagged me aff. This is... ...dreams coming true. If that was me, I would have reacted. I'm from So Solid so I'd have been like, "You know what, Noel, yeah? Fuck off, you prick." HE LAUGHS Much to everyone's surprise, Noel responded with a rare display of humour of his own by showing his son recreating Lewis's mournful sounds in a highly entertaining mickey take. IMITATES LEWIS CAPALDI TEARFULLY Poor Lewis Capaldi probably grew up looking up to Oasis, wakes up one morning and he's getting absolutely annihilated by Noel Gallagher, probably thinking, "Oh, you've crushed me. "Now, my idol's my rival." The thing is with Lewis Capaldi is he uses humour as a bit of a weapon. You know, he's really, really very funny and he's used that against Noel. CHEERING He certainly did when he took the stage at Glastonbury to the delight of the crowd. Obviously turns it into a moment of comedy gold when he comes out onto the Glastonbury stage with his Mancunian swagger and he's just like, "Yeah." ♪ you, Noel. Lewis Capaldi, one - Noel Gallagher, nil- HE CHUCKLES And that's not all - Lewis scored another point when he posed for a photo with Noel's nemesis - brother, Liam. He's such a dude. Noel was no doubt mad for it by now, especially when his daughter tweeted this... ...and in another interview, Noel really goes for it. Noel then decides to kind of double down... # But we ain't done yet. # ...and slag him off again and sort of even worse, which is when he says, he's ugly. But Lewis was having none of it. Lewis Capaldi immediately changes his picture on social media and puts himself as Chewbacca. Love that. So now Noel looks like an idiot. You've just hammered this poor guy - hammered him - and he's made a mockery of you. And he continued to hammer him. Lewis Capaldi was number one for like half the year. You know, massive album... And there was even more hammering with this photo of him puckering up to Noel's daughter. That's brilliant. That's made me like him even more. I might even play his album on the way home. That's brilliant. Next up... Incredible. Yes, Terrence Howard off Empire, it is incredible and we're not talking about your jaunty cravat, but something altogether more shocking that happened at the 2019 Emmys. Alarm bells should have rung when Terrence arrived on the red carpet dressed as a Victorian magician. That gives you a sort of clue as to the kind of interview you're going to get. You'd think, after reaching that level of popularity, he would be quite well-versed in dealing with the media, but something happened, didn't it? With an interview. Yeah. Something certainly did happen - a shockingly incomprehensible interview. That was about as appropriate for the red carpet as a flying saucer. LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY Grade-A titanium-plated bullshit. Cuckoo, cuckoo! Cuckoo, indeed, but it's OK, Terrence cleared up any confusion in an increasingly passionate speech causing visible amusement in the reporters. Well, let me put it this way... I think we all know what a platonic solid is. Solid! All I can imagine is that a platonic solid is a term for when you have a clean wipe. It just went "Woomph" - you hear the noise, but when you look, there's nothing in the bowl. SNICKERING Woomph. Where's it gone? That's a platonic solid. But you can see these two... these two newsreaders who are there on the red carpet interviewing him. The guy... It's all the guy can do to stop wanking himself off because he knows what gold he's got coming. I'm putting something on YouTube... ...where I will build the planet Saturn without gravity and build the Milky Way galaxy without gravity. My... My head's just gone. He just comes out with just the most nonsensical... It's like if Uri Geller took acid. When I seen the picture, I was like, "Argh! "They've got you, man." He just ran into a media storm. Racist... Ignorance is not a defence. On the eighth of May, two clays after the announcement of the birth of baby Archie, Danny Baker tweeted the picture that would cost him his job... ...accompanied by the caption "Royal Baby Leaves Hospital." In that tweet, there was a historical picture, a black and white picture, of a very well-to-do looking couple holding the hand of a small chimpanzee dressed in a suit and a hat. People reacted, really, with outrage, saying this was a racist tweet and that the connotations were really shocking. That post that he put on Twitter, as he said, was an attempt to pour scorn on the world of privilege into which baby Archie had been born. I felt that Danny Baker's tweet was unpleasant, rude, sneering, discourteous and I also felt that it was pretty rich to imply or suggest that you didn't realise there would be a racist connotation attached. Even though Danny removed the post within minutes, the damage was done and he was forced to explain to the waiting press that he didn't know whose royal baby it was. And then I thought, "Oh, my go-to photograph when posh people... ...you know, walk out or have kids" went to that stupid photograph of a chimp in a top hat... ...and shouldn't have done and when people said, "That's Meghan's" you tear it down. "Oh, no. Oh, no." Cos I'm well aware of the centuries-old trope, linking race and primates. No! Not for a second, otherwise, I'd have to be some kind of slavering secret racist and I promise you, I'm... I wouldn't... Nobody invites this onto themselves. Danny's defence divided public opinion. Some might find it astonishing that a national broadcaster like Danny Baker didn't even know that the royal baby born this week was Harry and Meghan's. Yeah, I've known Danny Baker for more than 30 years and I'll tell you right now, 100%, don't even think about it he is not a racist. Even if he didn't realise just how offensive and obnoxious his tweet was, he did know that he was tweeting something horrid about a royal baby and who wants to tweet something nasty and malicious about a baby. Within 24 hours, Danny had been sacked from his job at BBC Radio 5 Live and returned to Twitter to announce it. I've been fired. Yes, I have. I think it's a bit weaselly the BBC chucked us under a bus, giving credence to the more vampiric stories that are swirling about. What he done was very naive and it's sad because he's messed up his career out of it so chill, but give him back some employment, man. That's harsh. And all I'll say now is God love you, Archie. I'm sorry about that. We got off on the wrong foot. And now, the dancing show we all know and love. No, not that one. It's our Strictly shocking round-up... ...kicking off with the dancer who wasn't even supposed to be there and ended up only winning the whole flipping thing. Oh, my God, be still my beating heart. I mean, I'm sorry, Jamie Laing, but your injury was a blessing in disguise for the nation at large because Kelvin Fletcher is just a slice of heaven. And look how amazing he was. Like, all macho... Guns. ...and guns... Gun show. ...shaking his booty and everything. SAMBA MUSIC PLAYS And I know him, I've played golf with him, he's quite a quiet guy. Yes. He's not an extrovert, but on that dance floor, you'd think he's been performing his whole life. Bit of an animal, wasn't he? SHE GROWLS AND GIGGLES All right. It was unbelievable some of the moves he's been pulling off. He's like a young john Travolta. From a young John Travolta to an old - sorry, Anton - Austin Powers. In week three, TV's Mr Nasty got a little too personal. Movie Week, when Craig mentioned... Aw. ...Anton's wig, his glasses and his teeth, darling. Aw! I slightly was distracted with the wig, I have to say. And the fake teeth that you have in. Woof woof, baby. LAUGHTER I did think... They're not fake, they're all me own, dear. The teeth thing was hilarious. Tess, for once, went off script. That was a real joy because she usually doesn't. LAUGHTER They're not fake? No! They're not fake teeth. They're his own teeth. LAUGHTER Oh, God. Really? Slightly embarrassing. I'm sorry, Anton. I'm really... RAUCOUS LAUGHTER And the more everyone laughed, Anton was laughing and then you saw his teeth more. So then it made it even more funny. You didn't see Craig embarrassed very often, do you? But I think he was embarrassed about that. # I promise that you'll never find another like me... # I think that in this modern world, it's important to be able to have a nuanced view about a celebrity and Taylor Swift is one of those people who is quite divisive. I've heard words bandied about like "psychopath". No! # I know that I went psycho on the phone... # Pop princess Taylor Swift has made the shock list again this year for her unfailing talent for falling out with, well, everyone. There have been so many feuds over the course of her career. Taylor seems to be like a lightning rod of fights and fallout and feuds and messy break-ups. And Tay Tay's biggest bust up in 2019. Was with music mega-mogul Scooter Braun. Scooter Braun is a big deal. This guy is like top of the game in the record company label-type world out in the States. This guy controls it now. She's got no say in this. And she went nuts and literally laid into him saying, you know, it was an of fence to her, out of anyone that her record label could have sold themselves too, it should not offend Scooter Braun because he'd apparently been behind the bullying of her. She's now his enemy number one. She's going to write a tune about him and everything, put him in a video. Watch. We will! Next, Taylor's feud with the famously shy and retiring Katy Perry, which had rumbled on for a whopping five years, but this year, they made up. Do you know why they initially fell out? No, no idea at all. Do you care? No. They were not cool with each other for a really long time, like digging at each other in various tunes and videos. But in 2019, the hatchet was well and truly buried. I'm really very shocked that Katy Perry and Taylor Swift have made up. And then as a sort of olive branch, Taylor says, "Would you like to be in my new video "just to kind of prove to everyone that we're friends again?" And, by the way, this is the costume you're wearing - it's a beef burger. # Yeah # You need to just stop # Can you stop, like can you just stop? # It was sort of meant to be a celebration of the queer identity, then to top off her co-opting - I mean, celebration - of the queer identity, forget all about that queer stuff at the beginning, the real point of the video is I'm friends with Katy Perry again. What happened there? No flipping, shock fans, cos still to come - a mystery for the ages. One of the biggest stories worldwide. Welcome back to the show that literally no-one has called an award-deserving, heartbreaking work of staggering genius. Incredible! Philistines. Hello and welcome to Guess The Shock Celebrity Hero. Clue number one - it's our favourite UK-based Australian singer. UK-based Australian... I'll have to hurry you. Oh, I don't know. It could be Peter Andre. # Wanna spend the night with you Whoa, oh Rack off, it's not Pete. Here's your next clue. # Neighbours # Everybody... # Oh... ...duh! Jason Donavan. Thank you, thank you. Thank you very much. No, thank YOU... ...because, despite being in the dead of night, this action shot manages to capture perfectly the lightning reflexes of Jason heroically running into the building... # I need a hero... # ...wearing only his pants. It's amazing! It's such a good story. That's like my favourite story of the last - fuck it - hundred years. What's better than saving your neighbour in a fire? Doing it in your Y-front pants. You might have seen me on BBC One last Saturday night in a very odd outfit and that's just a taste of things to come. Jason Donovan just goes to show that he is a great neighbour, a great friend. He put out a fire in his underwear of his next door neighbour's multi-million pound house. Bless him. Didn't even wait for the fire brigade. # I come from a land down under... # Jason Donovan runs into a burning building - that's already amazing - in his pants! In his pants! I mean, what a neighbour to have. If you've got a fire, he'll come in his pants. You all feeling turned on by that experience? Oh, he looks quite fit. Look at that tushie. Maybe it was all planned. Be afraid, celebrities, be very afraid. Someone's just published his shocking "warts and all" memoirs and he's taking no prisoners. Take it away, Reginald Dwight. # I'm still standing after all this time The rich and famous around the globe were quaking in their Pradas ahead of the October release of our Elton's expose of his life and possibly others. Oh, hello, Bruno off Strictly. There's one person on the planet that is going to go, "Oh, I don't think we should put that in there." It's not Elton john. He is the true diva, so you just know that it contains all the juicy gossip that you want. The revelations went from the sublime to the ridiculous. It's just fucking great. He does not give a flying shit who he upsets and God love him for it. But best of all was the truly shocking revelation of an event involving royalty - yes, the Queen... No, not that one. ...was entertaining one night at home in Berkshire. One of the stories involved this unbelievably glamorous dinner party at his house in Windsor. This was one of my favourite stories of all time - of ALL time. Mm-hm. We're going to bring some charming people, obviously, to entertain Diana, so they invite... Sylvester Stallone. And then, "Hey, let's just add Richard Gere to the mix." So within minutes, according to Elton, Richard Gere, of course, has made a beeline for the beautiful princess. Princess Di is flirting with Richard Gere and Sylvester Stallone doesn't like it. Unsurprisingly, seems like she went for Richard Gere. MUSIC: Eye Of The Tiger by Survivor Things kind of boiled over, and in the end, Sly Stallone, according to Elton's biography, ends up offering Richard Gere outside for some fisticuffs. David Furnish goes in to Elton, and says, "You need to... Like, there's a bit of a scuffle "going on in the hallway." They go out and look and they're squaring up to each other. They're squaring up to each other! Now, here's the thing - Richard Gere, who I love dearly, he's an incredible actor - up against Rocky Balboa? Dude, you back away. Let the princess go. Hollywood royalty, like the biggest Hollywood actors on the planet, fighting for her attention. Like a couple of silly schoolboys. And apparently, David Furnish just pretended that nothing was happening and went, "Dinner! Dinner's ready!" That was a tough one. Linford Christie... ...once the fastest man in the world. Greg Rutherford... ...Olympic long-jump champion. Arg... What united this motley crew? Channel 4's Sink Or Swim, which took 11 celebrities who could barely swim and trained them up to tackle the English Channel for Stand Up To Cancer. The shocker? They only went and bloody did it... almost. Sink Or Swim was an amazing idea. "We're going to get some celebrities who can't really swim. "We're going to throw them in the water." I've never worked as hard or been committed to anything like what I did with that in my whole life. Don't let the waves do what they want with you. They're pulling me. Don't let them. Come on, come on! One of the biggest shocks was in the 500-metres swim when Sugar Hut's most famous patron beat the world's third-fastest ever sprinter with barely-concealed glee. That was like nothing I've done before, but I whooped Linford and I whooped Sair so I'm pleased with that. HE CHUCKLES The idea that James Argent could beat Linford Christie at anything... ...apart from maybe a crisp eating competition... you know? It's amazing, he did brilliantly. It was supposed to be technique-based, but I saw it in my head as a race because I always loved the fact - and I'd ring up my friends, ring up my family and giggle to myself - that I've beaten Linford Christie in a sprint. CLAMOURING But if you thought training was hard enough, the Channel relay itself, with eerie-looking night swims, was brutal. But there were some moments of levity. AFQ, you're going the wrong way! Avg, back round'.! Don't worry, I don't care what it takes. No matter what, we will complete the English Channel. We will do this and I don't care what I have to go through and I made all these promises and we didn't manage to pull it off. That's right. After three months of hard training, in dramatic final scenes, bad weather meant the team had to turn back... Fuck sake! ...to their visible disappointment. We could see France. I could see Calais. It was... We could see it clearly. And they got within five miles of France and you're like, "Oh, come on, five... "Greg Rutherford could do one of his jumps, "just get over there. "Really? You're so close." So it was a heartbreaking ending. So close, yet so far and it does still hurt. Ah, still, Arg, nice to have picked up a new hobby, eh? # Who'd be a Channel swimmer? # Only a fool like me... # I'm still swimming. In fact, I really hope and pray 2021... ...my dream is to complete the English Channel by myself. That would literally be iconic. I would actually be a proper hero then, if I did that. You literally actually are our hero, Arg. # Only a fool like me # Would forget he can't swim. # I just watched my first-ever episode of the Kardashians this week. It was exactly what I thought. You know, it was the everyday perils and struggles of being beautiful billionaires. You said it, Courtney. And those struggles don't get any more real than for one of those beauties, especially when it comes to love. She loves a bad boy, Khloe Kardashian. She finally had the daughter that she'd always wanted, True. The girl, Khlo, she's done it. She's got her baby now. She's got her Mr Right. She finds out that he's cheated on her, not just with any old woman - a young girl who's the best friend of her sister, Kylie. # I just took a DNA test # Turns out I'm 100% that bitch... # That's right, shock fans, Tristan allegedly did the dirty with Kylie's bezzy mate, Jordyn Woods. I don't know who this Kylie girl is, but she's not Kylie Minogue, so I'm not interested and I don't know who this jordyn is and she's not Katie Price, so I'm still not interested! All right, calm down. The whole dramatic scene unfolded before our eyes with a visibly shocked Kim in a four-way phone conversation with Khloe, Kylie and Kourtney. No, not you. Khloe Kardashian just knows how to pick them. What is wrong with this woman's picker? # Don't call me up # I'm going out tonight # Feeling good now you're out of my life... # Tristan?! What a nightmare. # One drink and you're out of my mind. # He was already a baby daddy when he met Khloe. Surely that's a sign you should stay away, Khloe. She didn't. Yet again, goes tits up. This was one of the most shocking stories of the year. Some, um, cynics thought that the whole debacle could have been a publicity stunt for the new series of Keeping Up With The Kardashians. Imagine that! Anyone who watches the show, as I do, would see that Khloe was in real pain and I don't believe that Khloe Kardashian or any of those girls can win an Academy Award for their acting ability, so I think you'd have to be not a watcher of the show to think that this was all fake because you really saw a legitimately emotional, upset reactions. Like this is my life and it breaks my soul and it's happened so many times. It's not just to get something trending. Or... Like it's my real life, no-one would ever fake this. The drama moved on to Twitter, where Tristan was quick to respond to reports Khloe had dumped him... ...just a few clays after Valentine's Day. Aw. While Khloe's bestie, Malika, also entered the fray, Jordyn went on to proclaim herinnocence on Jada Pinkett Smith's show, Red Table Talk, appearing genuinely upset to a clearly sympathetic Jada. The last thing I wanted to do was be that person. I'm no home wrecker. Right. I would never try to hurt someone's home, especially someone that I love. Right. Which only prompted Khloe to take to Twitter once more. Eek! Now, what's interesting is, since this blow up, Tristan has been sending all these kind of thirsty posts on Khloe's Instagram, like, "You look amazing, you're so hot, you're so gorgeous." And he's not even hiding the fact that he would like to get back together with her. I think Khloe probably is considering it as we speak. I don't know, though, that her sisters would allow her to take him back after everything that everyone's been through. # So don't call me up. # Tell you who's been a bit uncharacteristically goody two-shoes this year, shock regular Justin Bieber. Thanks, man! Thanks, Justin, hey! But in September... Oh, he's back. Bieber's back. That's right, Justin knocked it right out of the park when, in the longest Instagram post known to man, he admitted to having used, not just drugs, but hard drugs in his youth. Justin Bieber finally admits that he had been messing around with drugs in a big way. Bieber coming out and saying that he had drugs issues, things that contributed to his crazy behaviour. When you're 13, it's not really your decision to be famous. You... You can't... I mean, we all wanted to be famous when we were 13. And your mum and dad go, "No, you're going to school." I spent the day with him once and, genuinely, there was a period of time we were going to go to shoot something, and someone came in and went, "No, Justin needs ten minutes to go rest." Like, are you kidding me? And being adored was also mighty tedious. He's had that fame since he was 13. I can't even imagine the amount of stress that that man goes through. Great news, though - Justin went on to say he's now turned his life around. He's found Jesus and he spends a lot of time going to church. He's now a married man, basically a monk. Well, you're half-right. He DID get married to Hailey Baldwin. Hailey. She's not Alec Baldwin's daughter, is she? No, the other one. No, the other one! I think Hailey's good for him. They said that they didn't have any intercourse before their wedding. That seems like a bunch of bollocks. Their wedding was brilliant! They go to this beautiful hotel - it's like £1,000-a-night spa retreat - and even then, Justin Bieber manages to piss people off, doesn't he? Oh, only all the other paying guests - who were all offered refunds after being denied access to the luxury facilities, as the happy couple wanted to take over the whole place for their private nuptials. If I paid for a luxury holiday and they said, "No, no, no, you can't use it because Bieber's coming," I'd sue them. But it's Justin Bieber! I don't care! Who cares about Bieber? I'd frickin' sue them. Fair enough. How dare them?! Yeah. Who do them think them are?! # When we walked in, I said I'm sorry. # This is one of the biggest stories worldwide. I saw it on Sky, I saw it on CNN, I saw it on Fox. Attention, everyone. Lenny Kravitz has lost his sunglasses. That's right. In September, after an LA gig, poor Lenny Kravitz's vintage sunglasses appeared to fly away. # I want to get away # I want to fly away... # That's how I know Lenny Kravitz - sunglasses on, wild afro, no top on, girls magnet... # I gots to fly away! # They weren't just any old sunglasses. It wasn't Sunglasses Hut. These were family heirlooms. No. Just buy a new pair! Lenny took to Twitter with a heartfelt plea for the sunny safe return. # But I still haven't found what I'm looking for. # Could anyone help him out to find his favourite sunglasses? Give me a freaking break! He set up his own e-mail address, which anybody can send an e-mail to at any time. Send him commiserations or just saying, "I hope you find your sunglasses soon and, during this dark time, "maybe, you know, we can sort something out." The Twittersphere flocked to reply with appropriate sympathy. Sort of! If Lenny Kravitz puts his glass on the top of his head, they disappear anyway. How you seen his afro? I mean, a couple of years ago, he was losing his genitals out of his trousers, which was shocking enough. But when your sunglasses go, what's going to protect your eyes when that comes wanging out and smashes you in the face? Steady! I just hope he finds those sunglasses because, if he does, it's a happy ending. And you could... I'm just saying, there's going to be movie rights available. If you say so. But in the meantime, here at Shock Towers, we want to help. Obviously, I want to help, Lenny, so, I mean... I could put some missing posters up around Worthing. I mean, I'm not sure you have been to Worthing. I looked everywhere for them. Everywhere. Hope you got 'em, Len, cos... He's a good guy, that Kravitz. Why is Michaeljackson, an adult, repeatedly sleeping in the same bed with a young boy? Throughout his career, shocking and persistent rumours followed the King of Pop. But in March 2019, his already-tarnished image was damaged beyond repair. It was too much. I couldn't even watch it all. It made me feel sick. It is a really difficult thing to watch. British director Dan Reed's documentary Leaving Neverland, with its starkly-shot interviews with Wade Robson and James Safechuck, gave us unprecedented, shocking first-hand accounts of alleged childhood abuse at the hands of Jackson. This harrowing tale of sexual and emotional trauma was graphic and X-rated in all its appalling detail. Michael would like it if you... If you would bend over and... ...like, spread, open your cheeks. That's what he liked. And then he would masturbate. "What this is is us, how we show our love for each other. "Other people are ignorant and they're stupid. "They'd never understand." If they ever found out what we were doing, about this sexual stuff, that he and I would be pulled apart, and that we'd never be able to see each other again, and that he and I would go to jail for the rest of our lives. You know, people had to leave cos they threw up in the lobby when they first watched this movie in cinemas. James Safechuck's candid on-camera confessionals made for extremely unsettling viewing. He would run drills with me where we would be in the hotel room and he would pretend like somebody was coming in, and you had to get dressed as fast as possible without making noise. So not getting caught was a big, like, just kind of fundamental. That is... calculated. That's what makes it more disturbing, you know? So, basically, when I'm... It actually makes me feel sick saying this, but when I'm fondling with you, you know, make sure we're prepared to prepare yourself to get dressed quicker and hide, so no-one knows what's going on. Ah, mate! The documentary raised other worrying questions, including the involvement of the boy's parents. The film, I think, is... is... The focus on your mothers - did they just miss what was happening or did they push it away? Did they deny it? How have the parents allowed their kids to go and stay in a man's house and sleep in his bed? What kind of parent are you? In the run-up to the documentary's release, Michael's nephew, Taj, launched a campaign on London buses proclaiming his uncle's innocence... "Facts don't lie. People do." The implication is that two men allegedly abused as children by the singer are liars. ...and Jackson's family came out in support of him, denying all claims. When you do something that strong, when you make an allegation that strong, you should get both sides to it, to make sure that there's validity and there's truth to it. Exactly. Public opinion remains divided. I still genuinely think that Michael didn't do any of these things. You know, a lot of money has been made by this documentary being out. That's all I'll say. The Michaeljackson camp and his family said, "Oh, these are just two people on the make. "They're doing this for money." What money? I think being heard is, you know, probably one of the number one wants of a victim. But, you know, also, when all this goes away and the interest goes away, you know, we're still left with being abused. I think it was devastating for the Michaeljackson legend. It ruined his story. And, frankly, he deserved that to happen to him. Stay tuned for shocking splits - and who's been standing on Simon's X? What's he doing here? You're watching Most Shocking Celebrity Moments. What do you think of it so far? I've just completely been obsessed. Unbelievable! It was brilliant! Madame et Monsieur, willkommen, bienvenue, welcome to the singing competition that showcases the campest, the beadiest, the oldest and the most ridiculous music acts that Europe has to offer. Hang on, that's Madonna! What's she doing there? It's the right kind of gig for her. You know, it's camp, it's fun. It's not about being good at singing. Funny you should say that. When Madonna took the stage to belt out her iconic Like a Prayer, she left the entire congregation wishing she'd belt up with this ungodly and woefully out-of-tune performance, which went from bad... # I hear your voice # Oh, God, I think I'm falling... # ...to worse. # just like a prayer # No choice Your voice can take me there... # HE MOANS LOUDLY For anyone needing a reminder of what it SHOULD sound like, listen up. # I hear your voice # It's like an angel sighing... # But as for her Eurovision performance... It was like an '80s Walkman cassette when the batteries are dying. Oh, Madge, oh, Madge, oh, Madge. She's become sort of Mrs Clanger, hasn't she? You know, "Here comes Madonna! Wait for the accident!" The stage looked incredible. The costumes were amazing - apart from hers. Yes, let's take a moment to look at that, shall we? The highly-complicated outfit had us all wondering if she thought it was a fancy dress party and left everyone utterly confused. I... I... What? GROANS: What is Madonna wearing? Why? What...? There's so many... I mean, there's a clash of a lot of things going on here - pirate patch, fucking this, that, the other. She looked shit. Terrible. Blimey! Tough crowd, Madonna. You worried? They too have the right to speak their mind. Fair dos. In fact, it's all part of Madge's new alter ego - Madame X. What's she like, then, eh? She is a secret agent. And by that, I mean she changes her identity depending on the situation. Gotcha! We think. Wonder if it'll catch on. It's just going to become the next big thing. Your Biebers will be doing it, your... Taylor Swift, she'll be doing it. They'll all be doing it next. All of the kids. just you watch. HE MOANS LOUDLY Arrgh! Same time next year, then, Madge? Erm... Yeah. OVER PA: # Oh-na-na What's my name... # Yes, Shock fans, this was the year we found out R&B queen and all-round megastar Rihanna walks among us, breathes our air, shops in our shops, eats our kebabs - probably. What? What? Rihanna's moved to London? I didn't know about this. What are you talking about? She hasn't, has she? Yeah... When did this happen? The other day. What? Where's she living? Don't know. ON PA: Unexpected item in bagging area. As well as shopping in our supermarkets, RiRi also moved to London to be nearer to her Fenty clothing design team, which is based in Paris. Little-known fact - the bloke from the Village People lived in Newport. Nobody knew he was there either. You know, so it happens all the time. I mean, I empathise with Rihanna cos I've lived here for over a year and nobody knows either. So, you know, sometimes you take the good with the bad. Yeah. That's not air. That's 80% faeces, 10% cocaine, and the rest is just... Yeah. She's been out and about and none of us know. None of us. It's epic! No surprises that X Factor has found its way here. And this year, there was only one question on all our lips. That's not Martin Bashir! No! No! Oh, we were thinking more, "How extreme WAS Simon's vegan diet?" Simon Cowell looks like if you ordered a Simon Cowell balloon off the Internet. He's getting older, but his face is not getting any older. Whatever he's doing, it's working. But enough about Simon's boat race - as some really shocking news was that award-winning journalist Martin Bashir was in the celebrity line-up. To see him rocking up on Celebrity X Factor, I nearly fell off my sofa. I was like, "Oh, this is going to be one of the funny..." Cos, obviously, X Factor's got its format. You got your funny auditionees. There was nothing funny about Martin - and nothing particularly tuneful - though he was a tryer. # I is for the way you look at me # O is for the only one I see... # He may have been nervous. I think he didn't really have much self belief, in that sense. I know how he feels! Cos I did Stars in Her Eyes, and it was one of the most frightening things I had ever done. And I think Martin probably felt the same. # Love is more than just a game for two... # He got the big exclusive with Diana, Princess of Wales that I wanted, so it pains me to say that he really has got a good voice. Ah, yes, the iconic interview that made Martin the envy of interviewers the world over. It included those immortal words... # Love was made for me and you. # CHEERING He was great. He entertained. Everyone loved him, the audience loved him. He's a very nice man, he's very intelligent and he ticks a lot of boxes - except the singing box. Martin managed to last five weeks, with Megan McKenna going on to win, but his singing career may not be in tatters just yet. I'd collaborate with Martin. I'd... Come on, let's do it. Let's do it. I think he's too nice to not collaborate with. Stay tuned for some extraordinary jungle noises. SCREAMING Welcome back. You're watching Most Shocking Celebrity Moments 2019. I could only be surprised - and it was a pleasant surprise. HE LAUGHS And now, here we are in the jungles of Australia... ...where, if you listen carefully, you might just hear the sounds of the local flora and fauna. Yeah! This year's I'm a Celeb was a series of audible shocks. SCREAMING I think there's definitely been a lot more... HE HOWLS ...stranger sounds coming out of the people this year. SCREAMING Let's kick off with everyone's favourite striker. HE SCREAMS I couldn't believe that big Ian Wright... Yeah, he was screaming! It was hysterical. HE SCREAMS SCREAMI NG CONTINUES He's all, like, Macho Man - and then, like... SHE IMITATES HIS SCREAM ...the minute anything catches him by surprise. It must be some kind of outlet. And some of the noises were very odd indeed. I imagine he had to go... SHE GROANS ...just to reassure himself that his mouth is closed. HE GROANS The helmet was on, he went, "H00! H00! H00!" HE GROANS You got it! GROANING CONTINUES Keep it going, keep it going... It was so odd. Who makes that sound if they're in such discomfort? Quite a lot of people, apparently, judging by this shocking lot. GROANING Kate likes to be quite vocal about things - and I don't blame her, actually. SHE GROANS, SQUEALS I completely identify with that. SHE HUMS It helps you. Yes, it helps you. You're going through this rough, traumatic experience... SHE GROANS ...and you just concentrate on something else, take your mind off it. HE BEATBOXES And to take their minds off all the creepy crawlies, the celebs entertained each other with some peculiar and downright shocking noises. Didgeridoo! Do it! HE IMITATES DIDGERIDOO If you're going to show off your didgeridoo impression, do it in Australia. It's going to go down a storm. And it has. And it was very, very funny, and it was very, very loud and it was very convincing. I think his didgeridoo impersonation does have the X Factor. That's the best thing I've ever seen him do. But even better, I thought, was jacqueline's baby. Ah, that was fantastic! SHE IMITATES BABY CRYING You said it! Sometimes the noises came out as actual sentences. Don't go up my noo-noo! They're going up my noo-noo! B99 Pardon? What grown woman says noo-noo? Stop going up my noo-noo! I've known Kate Garraway for years. I've never even heard her use that word. Actually, why would she? It would seem odd in just normal day-to-day company, but... I've got one in my noo-noo, Bob. Bring tweezers! Yes, very odd. Something about that word coming out of Kate's mouth was very amusing. GROANING Classic observational comedy! This is the story of a multi-millionaire pop lady who finds her brand-new husband tasty - perhaps a little too tasty. Licking his face at the Met Gala like she did would hack anyone off. That is gross. Stop it. What was she doing? What was she thinking? All the cameras were on her. And they can see Liam painfully going through, trying to be as kind as he possibly can but looking incredibly uncomfortable. When they got married this year, I think a lot of us breathed a sigh of relief cos we thought, "Oh, OK, they had a happy ending and they've settled down" and "OK, it's good." They were like America's little sweethearts. You know, she was a rebel without a cause. And then when she got back together with him, she calmed right down and she became humble pie again and everyone just loved them together. But that was very short-lived. Yep! Seven months of wedded bliss, and then they split. I was really shocked, cos I just think... You know, you go to the effort of getting married and look so happy, and then - suddenly, overnight - it's gone. And then the next minute, she has got her tongue down the throat of Brodyjenner's ex-wife, Kaitlynn. Or, according to Team Hemsworth, Miley was possibly doing a bit of bouncing during the marriage, too, which she strongly denies. Shortly after Miley and Kaitlynn went on her little love tour, Liam actually filed for divorce. Liam thought, "Yep, we're marrying. We're going to have a family. "This is our future." And I think it was a shock to him as it was to everybody else. Oh, poor him! He won't be able to find anybody else - cos he's obviously a hunk of a man. But stranger things were afoot, as Miley quickly found herself rolling her tongue over another Australian - singer Cody Simpson. Now she's with a guy, licking each other's faces. It does seem like a bit of a cry for help, actually, because you just think, "What is going on? What is actually going to make you happy?" SLURPING Who would I back in a fight between the Schof and the Holden? I think I might have to back Amanda. I reckon she's... I reckon she'd have him. Yes! This summer, in the red corner, featherweight champion Amanda Holden went head-to-head with TV heavyweight the Silver Fox himself, confirming feud rumours that had been circulating for months. Amanda Holden was going to get the plum gig sitting beside Phillip Schofield on the This Morning sofa while Holly Willoughby was down under, standing in for Ant. And then all of the sudden, she wasn't getting it. Awks! Why is that? Major awks! So Rochelle Humes got the role instead of Amanda. Amanda Holden, she was furious. # Cos, baby, now we got bad blood... # The rumour mill went into overdrive. Phillip Schofield is a big act at ITV and Amanda couldn't give a shit. She just said what she thought! # Now we got problems... # What was shocking about this was that, actually, both of them are huge ITV names, and it's very rare that you would see this sort of fallout between a channel's key talent. Some pretty big people came out and sided with Amanda - Simon Cowell and TOWIE royalty - while Team Phillip also waded into the ring. According to Amanda, she had offered reconciliation, but Schof was having none of it. Recently, more reports have come out from other co-stars - and even from our favourite Loose Woman, Ruth Langsford, who was less than happy with Schof. Adding fuel to the fire. I've loved Amanda, I loved Christine, but having Holly back is superb. Hm! There are rumours there, too, I'm afraid, which prompted ITV to issue clear statements on the matter in support of Phillip, calling him a much-respected broadcaster. Phillip kept a dignified silence, but did share on Twitter. He tweeted, saying, in his 35 years, he had always tried to be the nicest person to work with. Poor Schof! If he did want to get closure with Amanda, we know just how he can do it. I think they should be made to fight to the death. Don't go changing, Shock fans - cos next, Hollywood royalty in the celebrity jungle. It's not as much fun as it used to be. Welcome back to our Shockateria. Stop going up my noo-noo! We wouldn't dream of it! Caitlyn's here! Yes! After years of rumours and promises of a Kardashian in the jungle, finally in November, we got one! # Welcome to the jungle... # # Caitlyn Jenner is amazing! # Hey! Oh, my God! I absolutely love her! I want to go do it again. In some way, I'm part of the royal family of entertainment. It's the most watched family in the world by a country mile. And she didn't need the bugs either, but we soon saw exactly what she was made of - as she took everything in her stride. For the first time, we got to see HER - the real Caitlyn Jenner - because, up until now, we've often seen her within the Kardashian environment, which is really hard to relate to. Do you guys have to have security everywhere you go? Kylie will spend between $3-400,000 a month. I'm going to get in so much trouble when I get home! It's really unrelatable, that world. But Caitlyn showed no airs and graces when it came to the Bushtucker Trials... Oh, shit! ...even the really gross ones! CHEERING Ow! You saw her being a really strong person for everybody else... ...and not being a diva. It's not as much fun as it used to be. THEY LAUGH And she definitely didn't disappoint when it came to letting us know just how well connected she is. She's the most down-to-earth billionaire I've ever met. He was kind of friends of the family... Was he? ..Michaeljackson. Trump, he called me on Father's Day. Kanye... OJ... Kanye... Kourtney... I know a lot of these people. She certainly kept this year's camp-mates' morale up... Whey aye, pet! ...with her positivity - no matter how early it was. Not just another day! Another day to excel, another day to be great! Rise and shine! Dare to be great! Caitlyn did brilliantly, and felljust short of making it to the final. She has been and was absolutely brilliant. She was the best money that ITV could have spent. All right. I mean, I suppose if it was going to kick off, it wasn't going to be the Oscars or the Brits, it was going to be the TV Choice Awards. And this year it kicked off royally when Emmerdale's Asan N'jie launched a shocking attack on Hollyoaks' Jamie Lomas. When you go to those kind of events, you know that all of the big bosses are going to be there. You've got to be on best behaviour. You've got to grab an opportunity to have a chat with the TV bigwigs in hope of landing something. The problem is, it's not televised. So people are drinking, and when they drink, they do things they wouldn't normally do. SHOUTING Because everyone's got camera phones now, they can't afford to misbehave in this sort of way at awards dos. We were all standing there chatting and all of a sudden we heard a bit of kerfuffle. And I looked round thinking it was people, like, larking about, trying to get attention. Then at one point there was a punch thrown. The bloke off Emmerdale, that night, ironically, he was nominated for best newcomer. I mean, he was best at something - best at ruining your career in about four minutes. The room that they carried the fight on into was the press room. So, I mean, that is really thick. SHOUTING I've been to so many awards, I've never seen anything like it. Threatening to knife somebody... I just think it was... It's unacceptable, really. Reports suggested that the two had beef over money, but settling it in a brawl? Not clever. To go there... ...and start a punch-up is literally what... It's career suicide. What was he thinking, the geezer? He may have been pondering the irony that in a harrowing storyline early this year, his soap character was himself a knife crime victim. But his Emmerdale clays are now behind him. When you go to cover an awards, you sort of think you're going to get someone off Strictly talking about how they're a bit tired and someone else saying they want to do Strictly. You don't usually get a full-on tear-up. It's only a TV Choice Award! In May, Desperate Housewives star Felicity Huffman turned real-life Desperate Mother. She ended up in court on charges of conspiracy to commit fraud for paying $15,000 to have her daughter's exam results secretly improved. Well, Felicity Huffman turns out to be the ultimate criminal tiger mother, doesn't she? Her kid wasn't going to get into university, but you can pay a company that can then get your kid into university via some manipulation of answers, which I think in my day was called cheating. Felicity was part of a group of SO-odd wealthy parents who were charged, but she was by far the most famous. They must've felt that they needed to really just make an example of somebody very high-profile. And so she was convicted, fined $30,000, given 250 hours of community service, and worst of all, sentenced to prison. The judge is not overly nice about it. So she gets 14 days. 14 days of prison. 14 clays of wearing a very unglamorous outfit, which had previous celebrity jailbird, Martha Stewart, getting her claws out. But if you think this is shocking, there was more juicy Wisteria Lane gossip to come. She gets her friends to write a letter to the judge to say what a great person she really is, and she's misunderstood. One of those people is Eva Longoria. It started nicely enough as a glowing character reference for Felicity. But while trying to save her friend from the big house, Eva Longoria threw one of the wives under the bus by saying that someone had been a bully. It's such a peculiarly odd thing to do. Who bullied her? That's what I want to know. Let's tread carefully. Bit litigious those Americans. It could be Teri Hatcher or Nicollette Sheridan. Or it could be either of them, or both of them, or neither of them. They are American, so they do sue. Who was it? Do we know who it was? Because I've gone through them all and they all look like they could... My money's on... Cut! Stay tuned, because we've got a difficult duchess... ...and a damaged Demi. That's pretty frickin' bad, innit? We're at the business end of the evening. Bear with us, viewers. The shocks are getting shockier. Everybody loves redemption. I love the rebuilding someone, cos it shows your strength and character. And tonight, not one, not two, but a hat-trick of sports stars turned wrong 'uns, who in 2019 have done the unthinkable and, against all odds, redeemed themselves. Tyson Fury is an absolute legend. In a roller-coaster career of 11 years, the Gypsy King's gone from wiping out Klitschko to total wipe-out. He had three years out of the ring. He'd become morbidly obese. It looked like he would never fight again. He had all that time off, went all through them problems... ...and he came back and arguably beat the number one heavyweight in the world, Deontay Wilder. People just love Tyson Fury. MUSIC: The Man by The Killers He won one fight in June and another in September. He's got an autobiography out at the moment, which is, I think, a Sunday Times bestseller. He's recording a Christmas single with Robbie Williams. Actually, it does, if you're this disgraced golfer. What a name. You couldn't be rubbish at golf if you're called Tiger Woods. Trust me, Tiger Woods is the best in the world ever. But in 2009, Tiger started on a downward spiral that seemed never-ending. Go ahead and stand with your feet together and your arms out by your sides. By 2017, the world had written him off. He was, like, 1,200th in the world. He was worse than me. Until April 2019. That was it! Once Tiger Woods was healed, ain't no-one fucking with Tiger Woods once he's healed. Tiger Woods has won his fifth green jacket at the Masters. His first major title in more than a decade. He made the greatest comeback in history, in any sport. To win the Masters was amazing. Our last story of sporting redemption features willow on leather. Ben Stokes started his England career in 2011 and climbed up the ranks to Vice Captain. But in 2017, outside this classy nightclub, the cricketer got involved in a brawl and was arrested. When The Sun released pictures, his freedom and career looked on the line. I thought, "Oh, my gosh, I hope he's got a good lawyer, "because it's not looking good." At court, Stokes was found not guilty of affray. Turns out he was actually defending others. Stokes' redemption started with his pivotal role in England's dramatic World Cup final win. But more drama was to come at the Ashes. He went out to bat with this Herculean task. He'd have to stay there at the crease for, like, 24 hours. There's no way he's going to do it. And I think it was that attitude, like, "You know what? "I'm going to fucking go for it." He did. Stokes almost single-handedly levelled the ashes at one-all. The Aussies retained the trophy, but Stokes' redemption was complete. His innings was described as one of the greatest of all time, and he won Sports Personality of the Year. That's exactly the kind of plucky story that the Brits like. Villain to a hero, literally. It's been an annus horribilis for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex this year. They've made a lot of mistakes this year. The renovations of Frogmore House. 2.3 million is an awful lot of money. To preach about the environment and then take private jets is just stupid. And many Royal watchers seem to think that Meg wasn't playing the game. If you want a private life, don't marry into the Royal family. There was a new arrival in May, but even that didn't go right. We love the Royals. The world loves the Royals. Yeah, we want to know the little details, we want to know who the kid's godparents are. We want to see a picture of your baby. Everyone loves a picture of a baby, especially a Royal one. Maybe they're just trying to give it this sort of moment of privacy before it is thrust into the world, like Simba on The Lion King. Aaaaaah! And speaking of lions, in October it seemed they were finally turning public opinion around on their tour of South Africa. I am here with you as a mother, as a wife, as a woman, as a woman of colour, and as your sister. CHEERING That royal tour of South Africa was in the process of being a triumph. They kiboshed the whole thing by issuing a vitriolic statement about press intrusion at the end. Perhaps you could just give us an idea of what the last year has been like. Um... It's not enough to just survive something, right? Like, that's not the point of life. You've got to thrive. You've got to feel happy. And I think I really tried to adopt this British sensibility of a stiff upper lip. Yeah, well, I guess, and also thank you for asking, because not many people have asked if I'm OK. It's legitimate to criticise them for that compelling but tactically appalling documentary with Tom Bradby. I don't blame Tom, I don't blame ITV. It was good viewing. It was good telly. But from Harry and Meghan's point of view, a disaster. Women have to take boxing lessons to try to protect themselves against the constant scourge of rape. To stand there and complain about YOUR life - your privileged, rich, royal life - when you've been touring the townships of South Africa was ridiculous. As the year ends, opinion remains divided. I think people should be a little kinder. You know, she's a young woman who just had a baby. Some parts of the British public and press have taken against her, and I don't think it's been fair. For quite a long time, Demi Moore was the most successful female film star in the world. But behind closed doors, it was a very different story - one that would come out in 2019 with a warts-and-all autobiography, Inside Out, that would stun the world. This was going to be a no-holds-barred. This was going to be everything about Bruce, Ashton... You just knew no-one was going to get away with this. No-one was coming out unscathed. A terrible childhood. You know, eating disorders and alcohol addiction and drug addiction and, you know, terrible marriage choices and a big rift with her daughters, and everything horrible you could ever imagine. It's brave to be that honest and open up about your private life. But then it opens up a huge can of worms. And she was even braver when she went on US national TV to discuss her troubled life in an interview that would shock us to our core. Including an alleged rape as a 15-year-old, seemingly with the knowledge of her own mother. I think... In my deep heart, no, I don't think it was a straightforward transaction. But she still did give him the access. Demi's book also revealed the breakdown of her marriages to both Bruce Willis and Ashton Kutcher. We all remember when Demi Moore first got married to a much younger, very handsome man who appeared to adore her. But clearly, behind the scenes, they tried to have a baby and failed. She lost the baby, tragically, but she blamed it on, unsurprisingly, on the fact that she'd fallen off the wagon and was drinking while she was pregnant. We learned intimate details about their sex life. She says how Ashton influenced her into having threesomes. Poor old Demi Moore, having a really hideous time of it, having a threesome with old Ashton Kutcher. Think of the pressure she must have felt and been under. If your partner is the one who wants to have more sexual adventures and you're like, "Oh, no, I don't want to," and then suddenly you think, "Oh! You're going to leave me "if I don't do this!" So you called him. What did you say to him? I asked if it was true. And... ...he admitted it right away. And I think my response was... ... "Are you BLEEP kidding me?!" These revelations have only made us love Demi Moore even more. I think it's brave for anyone in the public domain to open up about such toxicity and her substance abuse and to be open and honest about it, because this is real. And the more we talk about all this, the better, I think. This is possibly the greatest, most shocking story I think we've ever had. Since first airing in 2015, US drama Empire proved itself to be a massive hit. As well as being heavy on the melodrama, it was lauded for being ground-breaking in its positive depiction of its black gay character, Jamal, played by real-life black gay actor jussie Smollett. But the real drama was played out off-screen in a truly shocking plot twist. Jussie Smollett. Now, if you don't know who he is, let me give you a little recap. So, last January, jussie Smollett was beaten and abused by two men in a race hate crime. A rope was put around his neck and he was dragged to the floor and beaten. Or so he told Chicago police, and later ABC News in a captivating interview. The distressing detail made for extremely uncomfortable viewing. The attacker, masked, and he said, "This MAGA country, BLEEP!" Punches me right in the face. Then I looked down and I see that there's a rope around my neck. In the world of showbusiness, especially sort of Hollywood show business, if you can position yourself as the poor, put-upon victim, horror of horrors, of both race and homophobic hate, then everybody will go, "Oh, you poor thing. "Great. Oh, have this role. Do that." The outrageous details got Americans all fired up in support. If you go the wrong way and it's found out that you cheating or pretending something has happened, then a lot of doors are closed. And to everyone's horror, jussie was accused of not just pretending, but orchestrating the whole horrific incident, and jussie himself was arrested. That's pretty frickin' bad, innit? Oh... I don't even know what to say. Like, what can you say to that? This has gone way too far. I know that people will do anything to get a bit of publicity, but this is ridiculous. To this day, jussie maintains his innocence, but the authorities believed he was complicit. And weirder still when police made a discovery. They later displayed a cheque for... l think it was $3,600, from one jussie Smollett. But the Chicago Police have made it very, very clear that they don't believe a word of what he said. And so the now publicly vilified jussie's first session in court in mid-March saw him charged with 16 counts of disorderly conduct. Jussie, will you speak to us afterwards, please? I can imagine people that have actually been through them attacks would be pretty damn peed off that he'd made a complete hoax of it. But they were about to be even more peed off. For reasons no-one has been able to fathom, a further emergency court appearance was held soon after and all charges were dropped, his record wiped clean. . BLEEP?! Hollywood distanced themselves immediately, and guilty or innocent, Fox confirmed jussie would not be returning to Empire. I suspect that he probably won't get his own five-picture deal off the back of his behaviour. Jussie still stands by his version, and investigations, lawsuits and counter lawsuits have continued ever since. You're a bad guy. You're a pretty... You're a bit of a dick. Stay tuned as we'll be discussing Geri's Spice rack. She had great boobs. Welcome back, shock fans. It's been a hell of a ride so far. But guess what? There's even bigger shocks to come! I think that's brilliant. I think that's fantastic. It's the celeb story of easily the past five years. Easily. That was a shocking story this year. Come on, give us some dirt. Give us some dirt. Dirt, you say? OK. The show was Life Stories and we were about to hear the hottest scoop of the year. Yeah. Now, that is my kind of entertainment. Entertaining and shocking to learn that Miss Melanie Brown off the Spice Girls got a bit zig-a-zig-ah with band-mate Geraldine Estelle Halliwell. Oh. my! MUSIC: Who Do You Think You Are by Spice Girls We knew this chat was going to be juicy, but not this juicy! But that's like girl power squared! Girl power to the power of scissor! Mel's juicy revelations got the whole world talking about the Spice Girls again and sent the press into a frenzy. I love the way Mel B was like, "You know, it was just one night. "What of it?" Oh, stop it, you pervert! LAUGHTER She dropped the intimate bombshell just ahead of the Spice Girls' reunion tour. This story, it's being kept under wraps for the last 20 years. Super secret, this was. For it to come out now, just in advance of the tour, is a terrible thing to happen. It's amazing, because, like, that's surely going to damage interest. Well, being one Spice down wasn't so terrible. Ha! Victoria who? And the now well-publicised tour went storming ahead with all our other favourite Spices. MUSIC: Wannabe by Spice Girls Though surely the dressing room atmos must have been awks after Mel's racy revelations. She's going to hate me for this, cos she's all posh in her country house, with her husband! Geri is not the same Geri that she was in the Spice Girls years ago. Ah, well, now, at least you have your memories of when two really did become one. MUSIC: 2 Become 1 by Spice Girls She had great boobs. LAUGHTER Ooh, zig-a-zig-ah! It makes me cringe a little bit every time I think about it. I thought that interview for Newsnight was actually jaw-dropping. The moral blindness was astounding. On the 16th of November, Prince Andrew sat down with Newsnight's Emily Maitlis and gave an interview that misfired on an epic scale, effectively ending his lifelong role as a working Royal. It's a perfect example. You should take that and show people in media training courses in the future and say, "This is how you do not sort of "hold yourself in an interview, and how you answer questions and how you..." It was just so dramatically out of touch. It was true the Prince's stammering and hesitant responses did not present him well to the viewing nation. But you were staying at the house... Yes... of a convicted sex offender. It was a convenient place to stay. And I admit fully that my judgment was probably coloured by my... ...tendency to be too honourable. You're not divorcing your wife over the phone here. We're talking about you just phoning somebody who's sort of a mate, sort of isn't, went to prison. That's a very easy phone call. That's a text. Don't even phone him. just, like, "I'm not going to see you again because it's a bit weird. Bye." You know, just like that. If "too honourable" instantly captured the public attention, and not in a good way, the answers became even more outlandish. What was meant as a reputation-affirming piece was anything but, as HRH simply came across as imperious and self-important. On that particular day that we now understand is the date, which is March 10th, I was at home. I was with the children. I'd taken Beatrice to a Pizza Express in Woking. Why would you remember that so specifically? Why would you remember a Pizza Express birthday and being at home? Because going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do. With Andrew's defence including being unable to sweat, the interview was the equivalent of letting him tie his own shoelaces together and try and stand up. Maybe he just Googled. "Is there something where you don't sweat? Yes, there is, this. That's what I have." It's so ridiculous that it probably is true, but it's so ridiculous in amongst that interview that you can't possibly take it seriously. That's the problem. The prince's defence apparently disproved allegations put to him by Emily Maitlis on whether it was indeed him photographed next to Epstein victim Virginia Roberts, the woman who claimed to have slept with the Duke back in 2001 when she was just 17 years old. But it's possible that it was you with your arm around her? That's me, but whether that's my hand or whether that's the position, I... But I don't... I have simply no recollection of a photograph ever being taken. I don't believe it's a picture of me in London, because when I would go out to... when I got out in London, I wear a suit and a tie. It was completely unconvincing, it was... You know, even if what he's saying is true, he's not saying it in a sincere way. So then, as a viewer, you're going, "Is he lying? It sort of feels like he's lying. Maybe he's not, but "it feels like he is." There's a photo of you with her. "Is there? Don't recall it." Is it you? "Yes, "but that might not be my arm." Oh! Like, what? It's just like no-one talked him through it beforehand. The entire interview seemed shrouded in misplaced arrogance, and the very grand old Duke of York allegedly told his mm - AKA Her Majesty the Queen - that it had been a success! But literally no-one agreed with him. Just four days after the interview aired, Prince Andrew announced he was stepping down from royal duties. It marks a remarkable fall from grace for a prince who was once one of the Royal family's most popular members. In a statement released earlier yesterday evening, he expressed sympathy for Epstein's victims - something he failed to do in an interview at the weekend. It's a shocker. I think he'll probably have to keep a very low profile for a very long time. Coming up - who on Earth has made it to the top spot?! That is the story of the year. Welcome back. Time to reveal who's beaten all others to take our shocking crown. This is my favourite story that's ever happened. This is next level. This truly is next level. It came out of nowhere. It was just another ordinary day. All of us got up that morning not knowing that our lives were going to be changed forever. The nation went into meltdown in October over four small but revealing words. Now, a very public row has broken out between the wives of two high-profile footballers. And here's what happened. But Mrs Wayne Rooney noticed that some of this "real shit" was appearing in The Sun newspaper. So she embarked on a one-woman mission to find out the so-called friend who was flogging the dirt to the red tops. I mean, this was a six-month investigation into who was selling these stories. Coleen Rooney's trap to find the culprit was genius. Sensational headlines about life chez Rooney started to appear in the tabloids, but were fake, as wag-turned-super-sleuth Coleen had posted them on her Instagram to lure the culprit. Step one accomplished. Time for step two. With all but one person blocked, step three was planting the final fake story, which again made the news. She created a story about a leaky basement because, you know, I've flooded my basement before, and it's hard to get rid of the damp. Coleen Rooney's leaky basement - which sounds like the worst porno ever, doesn't it? No pun intended, she thought, "My leaky floor is now a story." THe jigsaw now complete, Coleen was ready for the fourth and final step - a whodunnit reveal on Twitter! Her compelling tweet read like a crime novel, detailing the sting along with the damning results of her investigation. Oh, my God! What's going on there?! No-one knew, but we couldn't get enough of it. There's not many stories that have me literally refresh my timeline, trying to get more information. It was covered by every single news outlet, from the high-brow, it was the story that had got the nation gripped. Not just the nation. The story went global, and Colleen got a brand-new pen name. Whoever coined that phrase needs a book deal. The way it was just written was so clever. I mean, Coleen Rooney, she should be writing thrillers, because that twist, no-one saw it coming. I think she should start a detective agency, an online detective agency. If there was a Hollywood scriptwriter out there now, get a script written and let's make a movie. Heavily pregnant Rebekah immediately penned her own tweet, denying the claims and criticising Coleen for going public. Did someone else have access to Rebekah's account? It's a possibility, isn't it? These wags, they've far too much time on their hands. Have more kids, get some jobs. Rebekah also announced she would be hiring forensic cyber security to find out how her account was implicated in the crime. She was like, no, cos there's no point in arguing with a pigeon. You know what a pigeon's going to do. It's going to shit on your head. She actually likened Coleen Rooney to fucking pigeon. It's the best analogy I've ever heard. When I read it, I phoned her and was like, "Are you actually kidding me?" She went, "Oh, my God! "I didn't mean it..." I said, "No, it's brilliant." I'd be lying if I said I can't wait for the next instalment. And so we must say goodbye to Coleen, Rebekah and all our celebrity chums. See you next year!
