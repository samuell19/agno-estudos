It's about 5pm and as you see the fans are rushing into the concert hall It's an incredible demand A demand that you only know from big pop concerts A demand, which could have been calculated before But many people didn't expect this ,because it is not David Bowie who is performing tonight it is not Phil Collins not Robbie Williams It is Daniel Küblböck! The pop-phenomenon of the year who is starting his big solo tour tonight with which he will tour germany for one month. Phenomenon is the keyword ladies and gentleman because "phenomenon" is a word free of value. With "phenomenon" you can register something either positive or negative [Fading] that you can evaluate yourself Daniel the sorcerer [Crazy teenage girls doing countdown] [Crappy 'Thus spoke Zarathustra' ripoff] """"Visual FX"""" [Balthasar] Look at this, Tom! Such a kind is getting famous. Poor germany! Ah ah ah ah ah ah! What do you think of this, Rike? [Rike] Such a pussy [Tom] Neither boy nor girl What is he, Balthasar? [Balthasar] Dead is, what he is He is dead, if it's up to you. Dead as a dodo. [original musicvideo playing in background] [???] ROCK ROCK ROCK!!! [???] "If it's up to us, he is dead as a dodo" Were you serious, Balthasar? Of course, what do you think? Someone has to do the dirty work don't you think? How do you picture something like this? How I picture it.... Real easy: Bang bang, basta! the end, finito. [The director, Ulli Lommel] [Tom] There is his father [Rike] Then Daniel isn't alone We wanna try it nevertheless? [Tom] Did you bring the pistol? [Rike] Nope, you should have brought it! [Tom] Shit! [Rike] Then we must do it without a pistol [Tom] How? Maybe with a knife? [Father] Ok, lets do it, Daniel Now comes your favourite activity [Daniel] Dear Daniel I can't tell you, how much you mean to me Unfortunatley I can't come to your concert in Circus Crown. But maybe it will work next time. I just wanted to thank you. [Old lady fan] I was so close to end my life. I wish you the best and that you stay healthy and that you will bring happiness and luck to many people for many years to come. Finally i can feel joy again And that is because of you! You have saved my life with your persona and music. [Daniel acting] I don't know, Grandma. I can't deal with it So much responsibility... ... you know what i mean? [Grandma] Yeah, sure... ...you have much responsibility now! All the fans who love you! [Daniel] But what if eventually... ... I dont want to do it anymore? Just... over. [Father] Bullshit, you are overthinking. Here, continue writing your cards... ... or we won't finish 1000 fanmails today. [Grandma] Should I help you? [Daniel] Noooo,noo... It's okay. [Grandma] I did it one time for Grandpa. I have a similar handwriting to yours anyway. [Father] Yeah, Grandpa was nearly the same as Daniel! He always amazed people! [Grandma] Yeah, he also made music Didn't you know? :-C Daniel got his talent from my husband He wasn't sinking over night [???] He was a great musician! He played! Til his death. [Daniel] Hm! :-P One more writing, who would love to kill me [Father] Let me see If I catch you on TV once more it means head-off, KüblbE(!)ck. And don't dare to [???] on your tour. Well, I'll give this to the police. [Grandma] Well, we need bodyguards for him. I always told you. Some really strong bodyguards [Daniel] I don't want bodyguards It's absurd. [Father] I dont think bodyguards are a bad idea [Grandma] I don't understand all the rage Gosh, you aren't harming them! All this useless hate It's really absurd! [Daniel] Dear Daniel... I think it's awesome... Wow, what a bad handwriting! ...that you are like half girl, half boy I love you, Daniel. Yours truly, Sabine from Vaterstetten. This is positive! [Grandma] On the other hand... ...he has millions of fans, who would go trough hell for him Such a career, as Daniels has done... .... is absolutely rare. If ever! They should see you and get to know you If they could see, what kind of show he puts on... ...how he is putting on his show! How he is standing on stage, two hours! Well, they would change their minds. Right, eh? [awkward pause] You know, bodyguards wouldn't be bad. [Father] That's what I'm saying all the time Bodyguards! [Grandma] Maybe you will go to America, one day. To... to Las Vegas! That would be something. [Daniel] In America there are better people They surely don't need me there [Grandma] You can never know! Don't say it. You can never tell, what's going to happen [Father] Las Vegas... yeah... ...wouldn't be too bad. [Grandma] Say, whats up with your singing teacher... ...Mr. Meisner? I think you should work a bit on your voice Don't you think? [lol] You just have to work! Working on yourself, real hard! Day and night. [Tom] Maybe we should wait at the forrest and just shoot him. With a good gun and scope. [Rike] What? Really, no! I think its much too cowardly! [Tom] You always have such a big mouth, Rike. I'm gradually fed up with you. [awesome Daniel singing] [Rike] Just listen to this shit. Worst thing i've heard in my whole life! [Tom] Somehow I can't see anything, Rike. [Rike] There isn't anything to see. It's enough to only listen to Küblböck! [sad song :-( ] [ I don't know where the tiger is coming from] [Or why there is a tiger in general] [Mr. Meisner] Daniel, that was neat! [Mr. Meisner] It's no problem, you can hold it. Hey, what are you doing there! Vanish Go away! [???] Let's start over again We can manage the stuff with the notes. [Daniel] Okay :-/ [Tom] To our Küblböck, who we hate beyond measure. Be quiet, I have to write this letter to Küblböck. [Rike] Man! [Tom] Don't think, that we will fall for your faked love for the poor tigers. [again, wtf?!] By the way, my girlfriend and I don't live far from you, in Passau... ...which you will visit soon. Well, this won't happen, because we intent to... put an end to this tragedy. [one of the greatest scenes of the movie-history incoming] 8-] [Balthasar] Something wrong?

You can get it out of your head, Balthasar. [Balthasar] How do you know my name? [Johnny] If you, or your fellowship... ... harm Daniel... ...you will have to deal with me... [Balthasar] Quit playing games. Johnny has been dead for at least 30 years. [Johnny] Ghosts can also be dangerous! [Balthasar] Hehe! I'm sorry. I don't believe in ghosts. [Johnny] I'm protecting Daniel... ...and I always did. [Johnny] You don't need to be afraid, Daniel. Hm? Tell me... ...you can dream, right? Just start dreaming... ... and the rest... ...will come automatically... [Balthasar] Even if you're right... ... you will solely face a huge superior force... Millions of people, who hate his guts. [Johnny] Do you know small Petra? [Balthasar] Petra? What Petra? [Johnny] You see? You have no idea...! Love... ... will prevail. >:-/ [?????????????????????????????????] [Grandpa Winter] Is this supposed to be music, Petra? this is unbearable. Is this the lunatic Küblböck, or what?

So we thought me may help. [Father] Very friendly. [Winter] Anything happened? [Father] No no, it's ok. [Balth.] I won't come up there to you. You gotta do it alone [Tom] What? You bail on us now? [Balth.] I have nothing to do with it. It's your business YOU wanted to get famous Tell me, Balthasar... Something is funny here... [Balth.] Funny? Why? What? [Tom] He put a spell on you, heh? Right?! That's it! [Balth.] Yuck! Bullshit! Do your part and we will see... [Tom] He is dangerous, I see... He's got something... Slowly i start understanding his fans. There is something to him... [Rike] Finally, there you are! So, turn around. We make short work with you. We will put a small pellet in your neck. Got it? But because we pity you a bit... we will do it from behind. So you don't have to watch it. How many bullets are in here? -5 or 10, doesn't matter. [Tom] Well, it will be enough. I shoot... and you record. [Rike] Ok, no problem! Dot it, Tommy!

You aren't able to stay cool, typical. [Rike] Tell me Tommy, what are you doing? What are you fingering around? [Tom] Something is wrong with the camera. Did you break it? [Daniel] At my home all hell always broke lose My mother was drinking. And I was always taken for a fool. And my brother was a Neo-Nazi! - Shit! [Tom] In my case it was my stepfather, who always beat me. Day and night. But one day I punched back, it felt great. It was so much fun! [Rike] Here, it's workign again. [Daniel] I learned one thing in my life. To NOT punch back. [Rike] Turn around at last, Küblböck! [Tom] So, camera is running. It's your turn, Miss Regisseuse. [Wordplay on Regisseur(director) and the female ending -seuse] [Rike] The gun is jamming. Do you wanna try? [Tom] I'm filming right now! You do it. Just pull the trigger. :-P I had a guitar once... an old and broken one. And they stole it. I didn't have money to buy one again. But I would love to play. [Daniel] I could imagine... ...that you could also dance and sing... If you wanted to. [Rike] Gosh, am I crazy? Did you lose your mind, or what is happening? [Tom] Maybe it's not so bad... Maybe we should give him one last chance [Rike] Okay... You know what? You can do this on your own! Including all the consequences, okay? I'm going home, making myself a nice evening. How about this? -Not bad! I didn't ask you for an answer, Daniel Küblböck. [Tom] I'm okay with this. [Rike] Good, that's how we do it, then. [Rike] And if you kill him, all glory to you. All alone. Is it fair? [Daniel] Yeah, that's fair. [Rike] Shut up! [Tom] I'll call you later. [Rike] What's on TV tonight? Deutschland Sucht Den Superstar [Germanys version of Americas Idol. Daniel became famous in it] [Rike] Very funny, Daniel, really. [Tom] Yeah, uhm... I'm gonna call you later, then :-P By the way, I liked that one song by you quite a bit. The new one. Such a damn bullshit! Now I'm stuck in this shit. [Daniel] How about a deal? [Tom] A deal? You let me go... I'll leave... And will tell no one where I've been. [Tom] I don't believe you! [Daniel] Then you have to kill me... ... or run away yourself. [Tom] Things are, how they are. All shit. And I am the biggest asshole. I will never achieve something big. My stepfather always said so, and he was right. I should have never been born into this shit world. Never! [Daniel] Just cry, if you want to. Boys are allowed to cry. [Tom] Then please, get otut of here Impossible! [Father] Daniel! Are you crazy? Where have you been the whole time? My god, where have you been? [???]... can't explain. [All concert footage is real, by the way] [Petra] Dear Daniel, Your concert in Passau was wonderful. My Grandpa is a big fan of you now, too. And sometimes acts like a teenager again. Thousand times thank you for the invitation. Yours truly, Petra Positive energy! [Winter] Yeah yeah yeah... positive energy. Well you gotta sleep now.

Sooooo, sleep well then. -Good night. -Good night! [Daniel] And... where is my christmas present? [Johnny] Since when do you just think about yourself? [Daniel] I don't get it. Didn't I do everything right? Haven't I passed my exam? [Johnny] You forgot something. Something very important. [Daniel] What? [Johnny] Tom and Rike! They haven't receiced a Christmas gif from you. [Daniel] A gift from me for them?! [Johnny] I want you to give them something... that you like very much. [Daniel] They wanted to kill me! [Johnny] Oh yeah, well... That's a long time ago. But now you are friends. [Daniel] I don't know... you can't really call us friends... I think you are going a bit far with this! [Johnny] Not at all! *sqeak* You will give them your guitar, got it? [Daniel] What?! My guitar? Never! [Johnny] Well. Then you are just an itsy-bitsy tiny wizard apprentice. [Daniel] Come on... I beg you. [Johnny] A wizard often gives that away, that he loves most. And you wanna become a wizard... a real, big wizard. Right? I got something for you! [BEST SCENE EVER] [Balth.] That was dirty little trick of you, Johnny! And that thing with your arm! Sometimes you got, sometimes not! Is that just one more dirty spell, or is it a prothesis? [Johnny] You can pick your answer, whatever you want it to be. [Balth.] Ok then. Maybe i lost the battle. But the war isn't over yet! I'm betting on it! [Johnny] I wouldn't be so sure about that. [Balth] You must give him your magic-wand, don't you? [Johnny] Why do you ask? [Balth.] :-D Then you will lose your magic power. Three times cockroach [???] I know magic well enough for this. In the corner. Broom broom it has been. My little Johnny. Then we get rid of you. [???] And can the little wizard even handle his new magic powers? I doubt it a little. [Father] What's that? [Grandma] That's something very special! [Father] Isn't there a letter with it? [Daniel] ...from the one-armed. [Grandma] One-armed? I only know one one-armed. It was Grandpa! My husband. - Exactly! We first met on Oktoberfest 1965. I was 16! He sometimes came to my tent, where i worked as a waitress. So I fed him, he couldn't do it himself, with one arm only. And... yeah... well... I fell in love with him. [Daniel] And what does he look like, Granny? [Grand.] Well, real dark hair, just like you. And brown eyes. Have I never shown you the pictures? Well, probably because I still miss him. I didn't have the heart to show you. Look. That's him! Do you like him? [Daniel] What did you say, where is he now? [Grand.] Dead. For along time. Somewhere in heaven. [Daniel] In Heaven? [Grand.] Yeah, in heaven. [Daniel] Incredible! [Grand.] So sad you didn't get to know each other [Daniel] Granny, please don't cry. [Grand.] You would have so much fun, you two! Well... that's life! Tell me, do you believe in miracles... magic? [Daniel] Im not sure [Grand.] What did he look like? Did he wear a dress-coat and a hat? And white gloves? [Daniel] Yes, Granny! [Grand.] And did he have s silvern metal-instrument with him? [Daniel] Yes, exactly. Grand.] Then tell him greetings from me, next time. Tell him I love him. And I was always loyal. And now go up and sleep. And seet dreams! And with the magic-wand... It's important... ... you must only use it to help others. But I'm sure he already told you, eh? You... WIIIIIZAAARD! [Daniel] I will do it, Granny. [Grand.] This stays a secret, ok? [Daniel] Deal. [Reporter] We are standing in Cannes, Ladies and Gentleman. In front of the festival palace, as you can see. And here will be premiered the movie of Daniel Küblböck. It's worldwide premiere. Who would have thought... [Balth.] Küblböck must die, KÜBLBÖCK MUST DIE! [The headlines are based on the real event of Daniel crashing into a cucumber-transporter. He was injured in real life] [Johnny] You don't need to be scared, Daniel. MY LIFE IS MAGIC!!!
