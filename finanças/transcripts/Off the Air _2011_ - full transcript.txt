Mm-hmm. It is December. Oh, you're right. You're right. Yeah. So, what are you getting into today? Oh, the usual. A family of campers moved in back there. I'll probably mess with them a bit. Maybe I'll walk around like this a little. Oh, yeah, I love that walk. Sometimes I try new things, but I always go back to that one. Whoa! Is that a Styrofoam cup you're drinking out of? I don't know. I'm not a cup connoisseur. I don't know what kind of cup this is. That's a Styrofoam cup. It's gonna be in the Earth forever. Well, I don't think the Earth cares as much as you imagine it does. Oh, yeah? Hey, Earth. Yeah, what do you want? Oh, hey, is that Styrofoam? - Yeah, put that in my mouth. - Really? Oh, yeah, that's some choice polystyrene right there. Hey, kick that tire over here, too. Uh, okay. Ahhh! That seems pretty irresponsible. You know what? What do you know? I got bigger problems than a little Styrofoam, okay? You ever seen something like this before? [ Retching ] - Oh, my God. - What?! Yeah, I didn't think so. Anyway, you'll be in here soon enough, right? I'll just show you then. [ Both nervously chuckle ] - Yeah. - Thanks for the Styrofoam.
