Well, I'm not entirely sure how these things work, but it did seem to be heavily watched. (laughs): 30,000 views or something. The video she posted of me garnered less than half that. Between this and her petition against me, it seems Miss Waterson's passion for equality cannot be bridled. Oh, dear. I didn't mean to bring that up. It's just... Hawthorne means so much to me. This school has 200 years of history. Many sacrifices have been made to keep our traditions alive. I just wanted to make sure you're aware of the possible legal repercussions. The public accusation at the end could be considered defamatory. Let's see if this works, shall we? (lock clicks) Ah. There we go. After you. I have to go. (chuckles) What about your comb?

The first one would probably be an owl, and then a bunny, and then an ant. Wow. Ant. That's bold. What's the game? Okay. Number one animal, owl... that's how you see yourself. - I see that. - Mm-hmm. Number two animal, um, bunny... that's what you look for in a romantic partner. Not today, apparently. JESSE: And then third animal, ant... that's what you want in friends. (clears throat) Why the ant, Marty? I don't know. I guess they're strong, - and they're all kind of, like, one unit. - (door opens) - Um, and you can't kill an ant - (door closes) because they're all an extension of the others. That's really poetic. RILEY: What the hell, Kris?! Did you talk to campus security? You posted the video from last night online? Yeah. Why? Is it getting views? Did you watch it the whole way through?

How? Why are you allowed to say all this shit about men, and we're supposed to just sit here and take it? Because men have all the power. Not all men have power. - Did you just "not all men" me? Did you just... - MARTY: Don't. NATE: Not all men are rapists, Kris! - Okay? I'm not. - No. Nobody... But you just lump me in with the bad ones because I'm a man?
