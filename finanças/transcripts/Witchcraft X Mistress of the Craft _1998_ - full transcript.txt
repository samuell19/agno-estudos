(dramatic electronic music) (ominous electronic music) (lightning cracks) - [Celeste] I am Celeste. For many years, I have served the Lords of the Overworld in their battle against the forces of evil. Led by the demons of the Underworld. (atmospheric electronic music) This is the Eye of Destiny. It is my one link to my home, and is the source of my power, the voice of Shaguthma. The Watcher of Chaos emanates from the eye. He is asking for my help once more. - [Shaguthma] Celeste, the demon of Morshenka has once more alluded us. Walpurgis approaches. Beware the servants of Morshenka. For they hope to free him from the Underworld, So he may reek chaos on Earth. - [Celeste] Night is upon us. And it is time for me to go to work. For I am the Mistress of the Craft. (heavy rock music) * Never stuck my hand on a sacred pin * * I like they way you stop * I like the way ya spin * It's all gone wrong * You led me on * That rock n roll to Babylon * I call you your house * And you're always out * But you won't say what's going on * - Check out the honey's over there. - Oh man, they're really something. - Here's your chance. - Look man, there's no way a babe like that's gonna be interested in me. - You don't know until you ask. Come on. - Okay, okay. (heavy rock music) * Such a pity you can't join us * * Things are going ever so well * - You fancy a dance, love? - I'm not your love, but I will have that dance. - I'll make it easy for you. - Pardon? - Do you want to dance? - Sure. * You never going back * You'll never see it again * You're gonna follow a track * Just like your subway train * It's all gone wrong * You led me on * That rock n roll to Babylon * And I call your house * And you're always out * And you won't say what's going on * * And meanwhile * Back in hell (Linnaca moans) (atmospheric electronic music) - Get off, get away, fuckin' psychos! (man yells) (man screams) (Linnaca hisses) (car engines whir) - We can connect you to over 35 murders across the United States. - I believe you already know Detective Lucy Lutz of the LAPD. - Well she's on her way here, and she's got a file on you bigger than the one on the Yorkshire Ripper. - You can't intimidate me. - You're finished, Hyde. We're holding you on extradition orders. You're going back to California. - You're going to fry in the electric chair. - Doesn't matter. You'll all be dead. Soon. (airplane engine whirs) - So when we found Hyde's temple, all his disciples were dead, and the groom was cut open on the alter. - He killed his own disciples? - Sliced their throats. I mean, I have evidence with that me that proves how we knew he did it. It was very strange. It's like, they all stood in line waiting for their numbers to come up. Just waiting for him to kill them. - [Agent Dixon] Like nuns to the slaughter. - So where's Hyde now? - We've got him holed up at Bureau 17, secret base just outside of London. Do you ever get so sick of the way the world is, you just wanna give it all up? - No, it just makes me more determined. You know, I was face to face with Hyde once, just before he escaped us, and I wanted to riddle his body with bullets. - [Agent Dixon] I know what you mean. - All the way in 1985, Amel Kosarison, 19. - I cut her open. Then I ate her liver. Damn tasty. (knock on door) - Come in. Celeste. - [Celeste] Evening, Director Markovec. - Here, take this. - [Celeste] What is it? - It's a file on Hyde. Not much yet. And he's waiting to be extradited to the states. They sent a detective over with evidence linking him to several ritualistic crimes. He thinks he's Satan himself. - Not sure how much I can help you here. My speciality is paranormal and supernatural. Religion is not a cup of tea, altogether. - I know, but we could do with your unique insight. - When did you catch him? - Three days ago. I would have called you in sooner, but, well we've been swamped by all the bureaucracy it takes to organize an extradition. You wanna get a closer look at him? (driving electronic music) - [Det. Lutz] I wasn't too sure. - [Agent Dixon] But you said you couldn't see him on the security video. - I know, but vampires? I mean it was a bit far fetched. Most men are insistent that they are vampires. - Now let me guess. Your rationale side said no way, heart said (mumbles). (Detective Lutz mumbles) Well, you could admit it to me. I know vampires exist. I've met one or two myself in me own lifetime. - You know, I do have to admit, the thought of weird stuff that I've come across in LA, I did get a little curious on how I could get transferred to the California State Branch of Bureau 17, but I (mumbles). And now, here I am, working with one of you. - Well, we've got a strict policy. You don't get transferred to Bureau 17, you have to get recruited. - Director Marcovek. - Agent Harris. - [Agent Harris] Miss Sheridan. - You better wrap up for now? You won't get anymore out of him. - Sir, trust us, we can't. - I said wrap it up. Detective Lutz will be here soon. We can look through the evidence in the morning after we've seen all the LAPD files. Celeste. - Coming. - Celeste Sheridan, I detect there's more to you than meets the eye. - Stay seated. Camera's off now. We can do anything we want to do right now. So you better do as I say. - You know, you would have made a good sacrifice. I would have loved to cut you open, and listen to your screams as I removed your liver. (hand whaps against face) - Watch it. - [Hyde] I scare you, don't I? (high-pitched, electronic buzz) (fist whaps against face) - Anymore of that hypnosis crap, and we'll blindfold you, alright? Are you alright? - Sure. - You're busy tonight, sir? - [Agent] Certainly am, Steve, certainly am. Laters. - [Agent Dixon] Good evening, Steve. - Cold night, hey. - [Agent Dixon] It could be worse. - Hi Chris. - Hello, Celeste. This is Detective Lutz of the LAPD. - Ah, welcome. Hope you had a good flight. - [Detective Lutz] Oh, it was fine, thank you. - Good, Markovec's in his office if you're looking for him. I'm late for dinner. I was cooking something special. I'll see you tomorrow, no doubt. - [Detective Lutz] Okay. - Good night. - Bye. (knock on door) - [Director Markovec] Come in. Detective Lutz. I trust you had an uneventful flight? - Thank you, yes. - [Director Markovec] I suppose you're curios to see Hyde? - Well, I was hoping that we could wrap things up as quickly as possible, and get Hyde onto a plane back to California by tomorrow afternoon. - Now, I can't see any problem with that, providing the papers are in order. - If I could see Hyde now. I have to see him with my own eyes. Just so I know that you really have caught that bastard. - [Agent Dixon] I'll take you. - It's Steve, I'm just gonna have a look upstairs, okay? (hand thuds against back) (Steve grunts) (ominous electronic soundscape) Oh, Jesus Christ. (Linnaca hisses) Oh no, please, please. Please, oh no. Oh, God. (Linnaca laughs) Oh please, get off. Help, help. God. Oh please stop, help, please. (screams) - Come on girls. We have more work to do. - Right, let's get him back to the cell. - Let's move it. (ominous electronic music) - [Raven] How convenient. A personal escort. - [Agent Dario] Get back inside, it's Raven Damonelli. - Looks like I'm famous. - Fuck. - And now you both shall die. Just as I've predicted. - I've had enough of your shit. - Dario, cuff him to the chair. We've got bigger fish to contend with. - [Raven] Open up. Or I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your door down. - Raven, we've got some admirers. - Ladies, we've been caught. - [Agent] Keep your hands up. - (mumbles) the cuffs. - [Agent] They won't do anything while we've got guns. (Linnaca laughs) Go check everything. (agent grunts) (elbow whaps against head) (neck cracks) (agent grunts) (Linnaca hisses) (agent screams) - Drain him dry. I'd like to leave some surprises for our friends. - [Agent Dixon] So, do you think you'll get to see any of the sites of London while you're over here? - [Agent Lutz] Oh, I hope so. There's so many things that I wanna see. (gun fires) - Come on. (palm whaps against head) (Raven growls) (Agent Dario screams) (body whaps against shelf) (head thuds against desk) (Agent Harris gurgles) - [Agent Dixon] Harris? Harris? Raven. (Linnaca growls) - Get off him, you bitch. (fist whaps against face) (handcuffs snap) (Linnaca hisses) (flesh rips) (Lutz yelps) - [Hyde] Let's go - [Raven] After I kill her. (stake thuds into flesh) (Tansy gasps) - Now. - No. (growls) (boot thuds against body) - [Hyde] Who are you? Why have you rescued me? - [Raven] We both serve evil. - [Hyde] What do you want? - Have you ever heard of a ceremony of Walpurgis? - [Hyde] Walpurgis? The stuff of myths. Walpurgis belongs in the storybook about demons. I seve Satan, the only true master. - I serve a greater God than Satan. One who rewards generously those who serve him, but if you are unworthy, then you will die. - [Hyde] What reward? - Power. Beyond your wildest imaginations. - [Hyde] I am worthy. Tell me more. - We all are worthy. (laughs) (Dahlia and Linnaca laugh) - Hyde, where is he? - Some vampire women made off with him. - It was Raven Damonelli. - Get Celeste Sheridan here, now. (phone beeps) - Hi, Celeste. Look, we got a major crisis down here at Bureau 17. Hyde has escaped. (bus engine whirs) - Raven, you have exquisite taste. - Why thank you, Hyde. Oh, allow me. - Tell me more about Walpurgis. - I have a book that will explain it all, but it is written in ancient tongue, that I know little of. But you, my dear Hyde, should know well. - This master of yours, what powers can he grant? - Unlimited powers to those who serve him well. Together, we will help him, and share in his power. We will serve by his side, as he brings this world and everything in it to their knees. - [Agent Murphy] The dislocated scaphoid would suggest a struggle. - [Agent Fisher] Okay, I've got that. He has two puncture wounds on both sides of the neck. - The blood has been drained from the wounds which would suggest that he must have been dead at least half an hour. - [Agent Fisher] There's massive bruising on the collar bone. - [Agent Murphy] So what was the exact cause of death? - [Celeste] Let me look. - He was killed by a snap of the neck. - Where are the others? - [Agent Murphy] They're in the interrogation room. - Okay. - I'll see you in the morning. - [Agent Dixon] Sure. - Well what about Hyde? We've got to find him. - At the moment, Hyde is the least of our problems. - What are you saying? Hyde is a cold-blooded killer. - And Raven Damonelli is a 100 times worse. (creepy electronic music) Everyone stand back. - My God, what is going on here? - I never liked you, Celeste Sheridan. - And I always felt like you were a pain in the neck. (Agent Webb growls) (Celeste moans) (Detective Lutz grunts) (fist whaps against back) (knee whaps against head) (heel thuds through flesh) - Wow. - You and I will be prince and princess in his kingdom upon Earth. - You're a very persuasive woman, Raven. (Raven sighs) (Raven moans) - Raven Damonelli would not risk breaking in herself to free Hyde unless she had a damn good reason. - And you think this is connected to this, Walpurgis? - Undoubtedly, Raven is the daughter of Louie Damonelli, who was a very powerful vampire. His kiss alone was death. He served a demon from the Underworld, name is Morshenka. It was one of the servant's of Morshenka who would attempt to free him at Walpurgis. - So, Raven must need Hyde's help, but why? - Perhaps there's something in Hyde's past, Raven knows about. - Okay. It's very late. Better get some sleep. I'll send Dixon around in the morning. You can both go through the LAPD files. See what you can dig up. - I was thinking of touring the city to see if any of Raven's vampire disciples are out and about. - Yeah, but don't take too long. You need some sleep, you're looking tired. (wind blows) (water splashes) (Detective Lutz winces) (car engines whir) - Oh, poor Harry. (atmospheric electronic music) (juice splashes) (Raven moans) - [Harry] Hi. - [Celeste] I am so sorry. - Where have you been? It's 3 a.m. - I had a major crisis at work. - Look, even police detectives work regular hours. - I'm not police, I'm Interpol, and I'm not a detective, I'm a special adviser. It means irregular hours. (Celeste mumbles). - Did you find him? - No. - It doesn't matter about dinner. We'll have it for breakfast. - I have to be up early, I won't-- - Shh. It doesn't matter. - I love you. (driving electronic music) - Thank you. (glasses clink) Mm, do you mind if I make a quick call? It's to the states? - [Agent Dixon] No, of course not. Feel free. - Hi, Gardner? It's me. Yeah. Not so good. Um, can I ask you for a favor? If I um, if I don't make it back, call my sister and tell her that I love her. No, I can't explain now. Just, just tell the captain that there's been some complications, and that I'll be late returning, okay? Thanks, Gardner. Bye. That was my partner back home. We've been a team for years now. - I used to work for Scotland Yard. The Flying Squad Division. - Oh yeah? So how did ya end up at Interpol? - Oh, it wasn't a very concerted effort to get to work for them. It all started with this case that was a bit out of this world. It was Markovec of Bureau 17 who recruited me, so to speak. That was okay cause I always had this fascination with the occult and the mysterious and the supernatural. I've even got my own theory on Jack The Ripper. (Detective Lutz laughs) - Oh, really? Ooh, I'd love to hear it sometime. - Yeah, so why did you decide to become a cop? - My dad was a cop. I never saw much of him, though. We weren't that close. I guess I joined the force in order to make him appreciate me. I'd hoped that it would bring us closer. - And did it? - He died before I graduated the academy. He was killed in a gang shootout. - I'm sorry. But I'm sure he's very proud of you. (ominous electronic music) - The Book of Morshenka. (car engines whir) - So, how many supernatural killers have you come across? - Actually, I don't get to see much of that stuff. Celeste does most of the work when it comes to attacking the paranormal. - Ooh, fighting fire with fire? (door clacks) - Morning, boss. - Mm-hmm. I want you to go and see Miss Sheridan after you've taken Detective Lutz to wherever she would like to spend the day. - I assumed I would be spending the day assisting you retrieve Hyde. - This is a Bureau 17 matter, detective. As far as I recall, you came here to escort Hyde back to California. Nothing more. Besides, Raven is our main priority now. - But, sir. - I have been working on the LAPD investigation for the past seven months. - Excuse me, sir, but I have to believe that Detective Lutz input be vital. I mean last night, she risked her life trying to stop Hyde and Raven escaping. - Very well. - This is everything we have to date. - Thank you, detective. And please, accept my apologies. Dixon. I want you to introduce Detective Lutz to Miss Sheridan. - Yes, sir. (ominous electronic music) (birds chirp) - Would you mind calling Celeste? Her number's programmed in. - Sure. (car engines whir) (phone rings) - Sheridan. - Hi, this is Detective Lutz, we met last night. - Good morning, detective. - Agent Dixon and myself are on our way over to his place to check some things out. Are you able to join us? - Do you have Hyde's files? - [Detective Lutz] Yeah. - Okay, I'll meet you there then. Bye. - Hey, that's my stuff. - Well then, I advise you to pick it up and get out of here. - This my spot, I found this place. - This building is mine now. - Hey Trev, we got troublemaker. (head thuds against column) - Let him go. (pole clacks on floor) - Fuck. (fist whaps against face) (Trev screams) (bones crack) (body thuds on floor) Please don't kill me. Place is yours. I'll do anything you want. - If I spare you, then you will serve me. - Yeah, anything. - If you fail me or try to leave, I'll hunt you down and kill you, understand? - Yes. - Bring me the book. - Okay, so what are we looking for? - Any references to Morshenka, the Underworld, demons, not Satanism, oh, and Walpurgis. - Walpurgis? - It's a ceremony, I don't know much more than that. My guess is, that Raven rescues Hyde to assist her in the ceremony. - Well if anyone knows anything about a ceremony, it's Hyde. And going by his previous Satanic ceremonies, I'd hazard to guess that killing will most probably feature somewhere. - As I said, Satanism isn't a part of this. We're dealing with something more powerful. - Mikey. It all comes back to me now. - What's up then, boss? - I read this many years ago in his mister's mere fable, but obviously Raven knows something I don't. She and her family have been in service of Morshenka for centuries. What's this? Beware the holder of the Eye of Destiny. The servant of Shaguthma. The Lodger of Chaos guards the eye. If the eye is used against Morshenka as he leaves the underworld and enters Earth, Morshenka will be banished into limbo, and his power will be absorbed by the eye or whoever controls the eye. His power will be absorbed by whoever controls the eye. - [Agent Dixon] Where are you going? - It's almost dark. Raven's vampires will be up and about. I'll meet you guys at Bureau 17 later. Have you found anything? - Yeah. Lucy found, where is it. Lucy found this. - Hyde worked many years ago as an assistant to a James Radley at Berkeley. Now, Radley was a professor in mythology, and his interest was in forgotten mythology and classical literature. I believe that this is where Hyde first started his interest in Satanism, but Radley also taught him dead languages. - Oh, let me guess, Radley also translated ancient books? - And one of the books was the Book of Morshenka. A book about the Underworld's Demon of Pestilence. - Now, when Hyde stopped working Radley, he moved to this commune, where the guru was a Satanist. - And after three years, Hyde killed the guru and started his own cult in Texas. - Raven must have Book Of Morshenka, that must explain Walpurgis. Why don't you see if you can track down this Professor Radley and perhaps he can shed some light. I'll see you later. - Okay. - Bye - [Hyde] About time. You and your vampires sure know how to waste the better part of a day. - Where's my book? - Yes Raven, I have it. I decided to start early. But you haven't told me everything. Have you? - It wasn't Morshenka's wish. - Still, it doesn't matter now. I planned everything already. Tonight, we'll be at Walpurgis. - Have you translated the pages? - I know everything I need to know about Walpurgis. - [Raven] What must we do? - [Hyde] I need you and your girls to bring me sacrifices. - Allow me, mistress. - And me. - Quiet. - Such enthusiasm for sacrifice. I've never seen it before. I want you to bring me Special Agent Ben Markovec. - What, go back to Bureau 17? - [Hyde] Don't tell me you're scared to go back there. - But what if Celeste is there? - Must I think of everything? Celeste won't be there. One of your girls will distract her. - Okay. - Thanks. - [Agent Dixon] Well? - That was Gardner. I had him check on a few things for me. It's not good. Radley was killed several years ago by a certain Louis Damonelli. - [Agent Dixon] Louie Damonelli. Raven's father. - Well, Damonelli must have stolen the book. Which means, we're back to square one. - No, no, I'm sorry, it's just. - Shh. (atmospheric electronic music) (thunder booms) - Morshenka. - [Morshenka] You can't, for you cannot defeat me, witch. In a few hours I will be free. And you, servant of Shaguthma will be the first to feel my wrath. - I will defeat you demon or die trying. - [Mikey] What now, boss? - You're the thief, get me in. (heavy electric guitar) (man coughs and groans) - [Man] What's that? What is that? (nails scratch on wall) Who's there? Oh, found a coin, anyway. Who's there? Oh. I've got a pound coin. - We've been waiting for you. - I've been waiting, darling. (man grunts) - We want your money. - Do you want my money? (man screams) (driving rock music) - Well, if it isn't Raven's right hand bitch. - I should have killed you the other night. - That was your chance. - Let's see what you can do. (Linnaca grunts) (upbeat electronic music) (fist thuds against head) (fist thuds against stomach) (hand whaps against head) (knife thuds into flesh) (Linnaca gasps and gurgles) - See you in hell. - No. - This my friend, is used to, I will use to steal the power from the evil Morshenka. - What have you done? - You're too late. There's nothing you can do now. I have the Eye of Destiny, and soon I will be the most powerful warlock on Earth. Mikey, the matchbook. Let's get out of here. (phone rings) - [Harry] Hello? - Harry, it's me, where are you? (cabinets clack) - Who the hell are you? (fist whaps against head) (hand whacks against head) - [Hyde] (sighs) Get the Eye of Destiny. I'll bring him. He'll make a good sacrifice. - Harry. - Hey, Celeste, baby. You've reached a number that's been disconnected or is no longer in service. If you feel you've reached this recording in error, who gives a fuck. (phone clacks against booth) (car engines whir) (ominous electronic music) - [Raven] Kill anyone you see. Drain them dry. And bring Markovec to me. - [Agent] So I told him given the evidence, there was just no way we could detect whether or not... - [Raven] Go. (agent screams) Good evening, Mr. Markovec. - [Agent Markovec] Raven. What a surprise. - We came for you. - [Agent Markovec] Big mistake coming back here. The place is crawling with my agents, you'll never get out alive. - No, you're agents won't get out alive. - The last one's dead. - [Raven] Excellent. Oh, you are defiant, but it will not help you. (cross bangs on floor) Give in, you can't resist. - Oh, no. - [Agent Dixon] Damn. - [Detective Lutz] It looks like the vampires are back in town. - [Agent Dixon] There could be more of them in the building. We could be in for some serious trouble. We better call for backup. - There may not be time. If Celeste arrived before us, she could be in danger. - Okay. I hope there's nobody else working late tonight. - [Detective Lutz] Come on, let's go find Celeste. What do you think happened? - [Agent Dixon] Where's Ben? - Do you think Raven took him? (phone rings) - Hello? Celeste, no it's Chris. Ben's not here. We think Raven took him. Yes, we'll wait for you here. - [Hyde] Do you have everything I need? - Absolutely, boss. - Good, then take this. But be careful, or your life won't be worth living. - You better not point that at me. We don't want an accident. - God, Celeste. Raven and her vampires have killed everyone who was in the building. - I know, I saw the bodies. - So what's the plan? I wanna kill those fucks before someone else dies. - And I'm with you there. - We don't even know where Hyde is. - Ah, yes we do. - I know this place. - So then what are we waiting for? - It's a trap for a start. - What? - Why else would they have left it? - They might not have known they dropped it. - Hyde wants me there. He's stolen the Eye of Destiny. - Shit. - Ah, excuse me, what is this eye? - It's a magical icon, the source of my power. Hyde intends to complete Walpurgis and summon the demon Morshenka, and use the eye to steal Morshenka's power. - Making him the most powerful warlock on Earth. - Mmm. - God. We have to go stop them now. - And you've got work to do before you can leave here. Stake the bodies before they turn into vampires. Go on. (Dr. Lutz screams) (vampire yells) (dramatic orchestral music) - [Celeste] The stakes. (stake thuds in flesh) (Agent Dixon coughs) - Jesus Christ, that was-- - Was, are you alright. - I'm fine, fine, just shaken. - You better stake the others or we'll have more vampires to contend with. (ominous electronic music) - Poor, Fisher. He just had a second child. That poor family. - [Detective Lutz] I'm sorry. Chris, we don't have much time. - [Agent Dixon] Okay, right. - On the count of three. - [Agent Dixon] One, two, - Two. - Three. - Three. (vampire screams) (Lutz coughs and gasps) - [Agent Dixon] Lucy, Lucy are you okay? - [Detective Lutz] Yeah, I'm just a bit winded. - Hey, you did great. - [Detective Lutz] Looks like we're gonna have company. - [Agent Dixon] Shit. Shit, it's Agent Simmons. - [Agent Simmons] Hi, Dixon. You're looking good. I see you have a little girlfriend. Good, I'll enjoy sucking her dry. (hisses) - Back up. - [Detective Lutz] Uh-oh. - Run. (dramatic orchestral music) (Agent Simmons growls) - [Agent Dixon] Run Lucy, this way. - Chris, Up here. - Lucy. (vampire growls) - [Agent Dixon] There, that will slow them for a minute or two. - [Agent Simmons] I can smell your sweet blood. - [Detective Lutz] Where does, where does that door lead to? - [Agent Dixon] Hey, we can use that to get out of here. (vampire screams) (Lutz screams) (stake whaps against body) - Hello, boys. (high-pitched, electronic buzz) (fist whaps against body) (neck cracks) (stake thuds into flesh) (Agent Simmons hisses) (stake thuds into flesh) (vampire gurgles) - Wow. - You are something, girl. (heavy rock music) * Winter's coming * Winter's coming for me * Winter's coming to take me * We'll score again, oh * The skies are white outside (Dahlia screams) - Leave us. - [Hyde] Not yet. I brought him here to be a sacrifice, not for pleasure. - [Dahlia] Very well, leave us alone. - Leave by the back entrance, (high-pitched buzz) and wait for me there. - Why do you have to sacrifice the cute ones? - [Hyde] Go find the others. Celeste Sheridan is on her way. * Winter's coming for me * Winter's coming to take me * Winter's coming again - [Detective Lutz] So how do you think this trap's going to work? - I don't know. - What if it's you that Hyde wants? Why don't you (mumbles) comes out? - It could be dangerous. - Don't worry, we've come prepared. - Just pretend you're one of the punters. - Two please, girl. (heavy rock music) * Winter's coming * Winter's coming for me * Winter's coming to take me * Winter's coming again * Skies are white outside * Sucking out my life * Winter's coming * In this year now - Why don't we split up? - [Agent Dixon] Wait, over there. I see something. (heavy rock music) - Okay, you distract, and I'll go see where they hid Markovec. - Be careful, I don't want you running into Hyde. * Ladies * You are welcome * We are the marshals of trance * * We are the slaves * At the temple of trance * We want you to come with us and learn * * How to trance dance (ominous electronic music) - Ben? - Ben? (heavy rock music) * To the left * Turn right * There's a trail of pills on the table * * In center of the room * Take a blue capsule * Then five minutes later * Take a red capsule * Ten minutes later * You'll be ready. * Now move around * Get to know each other (electronic chime) * I am the marshal of the temple of trance * (fist whaps against flesh) - What are you doing? - [Hyde] Celeste is in the building. (alarm beeps) - Is this your doing? - We have work to do. There's not time for dancing. - Who is this man? - [Hyde] Mikey, bring Agent Dixon to the sacrifice table. (ominous electronic music) - Huh! (flashlight clacks against head) - Welcome to hell. (Lutz screams) Now, you shall die. - [Detective Lutz] No. - Get back. (electronic chime) Quick. - [Raven] You don't know pain. - [Celeste] Go upstairs. Go. - [Raven] Kill them. - Run upstairs. (driving electronic music) - Dear Celeste, now I have my revenge on you. For what you have done to us. - Don't count on it. (Celeste grunts) (Hyde claps hands) - Hyde. (wind howls) (ominous electronic music) - Where am I, in hell? (head whacks on wood) (thunder cracks) - Coming storm. - If we had time, we could torture her to death. - As painfully as possible. - But you and I dear Raven, have a date with destiny. - When Shenka will be free. - No, Raven. He's lying to you, he's stolen the Eye of Destiny. He can use it to steal Morshenka's power. - Your lies won't save you now. Kill her. Raven, come with me. - Listen to me Raven. He'll kill you, too. You cannot trust him. - Warlock? - Come Raven, we have a ceremony to perform. - Raven, I don't trust him. - He speaks lies. (driving electronic music) (stake thuds into flesh) - [Raven] You traitor. (Lutz screams) (electronic buzz) - Lucy, the stakes. (head thuds on floor) (Celeste grunts) - Rose, Dahlia, come with me. (ominous electronic music) (sword clacks in sheath) - [Celeste] Are you okay? - I'm not sure. - Come on, we're gonna be too late. - Too late for what? - Walpurgis, Hyde is going to summon the demon of Morshenka. - Why did Hyde attack the vampires? - If he can complete Walpurgis, he will summon Morshenka.
