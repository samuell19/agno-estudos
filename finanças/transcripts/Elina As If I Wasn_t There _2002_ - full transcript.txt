Daddy... I know you're here. I remember. You said: ''See you out on the bog, Elina. '' So, now I'm here. ELINA Beware of the edge, don't step aside Keep moving, don't run... This is our bog, Daddy. It's yours and mine. Daddy? Daddy? Elina! Mommy's worried. She thinks I don't know how to make my way here. Script Kjell Sundstedt Elina, this place is dangerous, you could drown. - Daddy taught me how to walk here. - This is not a playground. Didn't y our daddy tell you that? Director Klaus Haro Northern Sweden 1952 Take a deep breath. Now let it out. And cough... One more time. Go get dressed. She seems to be better. I can't detect a trace o f consumption. But she needs to be careful or she might have a relapse. And your family has been through enough hardship already. Isak could be so headstrong... He wouldn't listen to me, he wore himself out in the woods. Well, I guess he had no choice... Would it be all right for Elina to go back to school? Do you want to have classmates, learn things... - ...and have hot school lunches? - Sure! Then Elina will end up in my class. - Who's y our teacher? - Tora Holm. The head teacher... May I go back to school? Yes, you may. Daddy... If I'm happy, then you're happy. I know that. I'm going to be just like you and always do the right thing... I promise, Daddy. Remember, you must speak Swedish at school. - Daddy always spoke Finnish. - Elina! - I'd like to see Miss Holm, please. - One moment... Excuse me, but there's someone to see you. It's about my daughter. Elina... - She's going to be your pupil. - So I've heard... I expect Elina knows that she has a great deal of catching up to do. The doctor wants Elina to be careful. Miss Holm, could you...? She has more sense than her father, I trust. Elina isn't a troublemaker, is she? There's no cause for worry. Elina and I will get along just fine. How do you write ''play hiding'' in Swedish? Play hiding - it's ''kurragumma''. ''Kurra'' - what...? Anton, what have I told you about speaking Finnish? No lunch for you today. - But he had a question... - No Finnish at school. But... Anton doesn't speak Swedish. That's why he's here. You're all here to learn Swedish. How can you learn something without asking questions? He shouldn't be asking you anything. I happen to be the teacher here. But you don't speak Finnish, and I do. In that case I shouldn't have lunch either. I think that a girl that has been as ill as you - - ought to attend to your own work. You do have a lot o f catching up to do, isn't that So? Here. Wasn't the soup tasty? Or didn't you register that Anton was doing without lunch today? Finish your soup. Eat, Elina! Mom says you need to eat. Listen to your sister. Well... You'll simply have to sit here until you've eaten up your food. Thank you. Have you ever seen a car like this one before? Don't you have a horse since you must borrow uncle Veikko's? What was that? - What did he say? He asked if you had horses of your own. - Finnish is all he speaks, you see. - Is that so... How do you say 'hi' in Finnish? Hei! That was simple enough. Now how do you say: My name is Einar, and I'm the new teacher? My...name...is. Hi, my name is Einar Bjork. Hello. Welcome, Mr. Bjork. I'm Tora Holm, the head teacher. And I try to teach these children Swedish. You're not going anywhere! I have to go clean the school. The potatoes need harvesting, there will be frost any day now. - Are you sure you can manage? - Of course. I've got to run. You should be able to make do with rusks for supper, right? Elina... I was so ashamed of you! How dare you refuse to eat your pea soup like that? Anna wondered if you had lost your mind! - What if you're taken into care? - Quit whining and help out! - I won't! - And Mom thinks you're so obedient! What are you doing? So the food was more appealing today, was it? Good, so we don't have to throw it out, like yesterday. Is she picky? Little missy here doesn't like pea soup. Pea soup isn't such a hit, I guess. I mean, you shouldn't force kids... If the food is good enough one day, it's good enough all the time. Particularly if you're poor enough to need handouts from the state. Where are you going, Elina? Don't you dare leave, you hear! Let's take out our workbooks. That is, if any one Still respects the word of their teacher... First question: What did the king of Babel want? Question number two: Who was cast into the blazing furnace? You've received your assignment for tomorrow... - You may go. - Thank you! Elina, stay behind and wipe down the blackboard. - Irma, where is Elina? - She's helping our teacher. I was delighted to see that you applied yourself to your workbook. That you wrote down the answers... I sense that you intend to apologize for your behavior. AII you need to say is ''I'm sorry'' and we can forget about this. We can make a fresh start. AII right... Then go! I had no idea that you were so rude and ungrateful. You're just like your father. And we all know how he ended up... Beware of the edge, don't step aside Sorry... Why should I say I'm sorry? I haven't done any thing wrong. If you haven't done any thing wrong, why apologize? Tora Holm should say she's sorry. Did you hear that, Daddy? That I'm like you - just like you? Look out children! You're too close. Elina, is it safe to cross here? Yes. You have to help the calf, Daddy! Help that calf! Please! Thank you Elina. Now, that's enough. It was Daddy who helped the calf. - What was that? - Daddy saved the calf. Daddy's dead, he's in the graveyard! Are you finished drawing? Elina's done. Now isn't that nice? Come up here and show it to me. Wait a minute... What's this? It was Daddy who helped the calf... What was that? I'm sure you can say it in Swedish. Well, Elina? Irma, could you tell me what your sister said? She said that Daddy saved the calf. Really? So Elina's father, Isak - - pulled the calf out of the swamp? Weren't we silly to think that Veikko Niemi did it? Why are you sitting here instead of lining up for lunch? Go on in... Please? Elina... Let's talk. I heard you gave Anton your soup. That was very considerate of you. And I bet your teacher actually thinks so too, don't you? She might not know that you're out here. I think the two of us should go inside. I think your teacher would be very pleased. Come on. - You won't regret it. - Oh, my... So now the entire teaching staff has to jolly Elina into eating. - She's on her way in now. - So I see. - Was that really necessary? - What do you mean? - Provoking the girl like that. - Provoking? Have I provoked any one? I'm trying to teach these kids some manners. I teach them to speak and write in Swedish. I teach the rules they need to become members of the society. Without the right skills, you get nowhere. You remain trapped in poverty. It's a thankless task trying to teach these little Finns... But it has to be done. You do realize that, don't you? Are you coming? See what I mean? I don't care what the others say... I know you saved the calf. I speak my mind, because that's what you taught me to do. I want to be just like you, Daddy. I'm glad I can spend time with you, and I know you enjoy it too. It's almost winter, and there'll be snow... And I won't be able to come here for a while. Are you crazy? Daddy's not here, he's dead. You're not allowed to be here. Mom's going to cry when I tell her. Irma, wait! Wait, Irma... - Don't tell Mom. Promise? - Let go! That hurts. If you tell on me, I'll tell about the magazines under your mattress. I promise. Cross my heart and hope to die. What if the authorities put you in a home for juvenile delinquents? They put out candy to see if it gets stolen... Elina? Are you out in the woods all alone? Would you like to help me pick mushrooms? They all look alike to me. Maybe you could help me find some edible ones. And we could talk about this trouble between you and your teacher... I don't want to meddle... ...but you could contact the local authorities. Mom wouldn't like that. I've got to go. Hello... My name is Einar Bjork and I'm the new teacher. You have a nice place here. I've never been in a barn like this before. - That's a female, right? - It's a cow. - How many children do you have? - Three. - Now get out. They're cute. People say that Elina resembles her father. I hope not. - Could I give you a hand? - No, thank you. What brings you here? I want to talk about Elina. Tora Holm... She has a great deal of experience, but... I'd better be going. Goodbye. By the way, maybe Elina should bring a sandwich to school. - Where have you been? - Outdoors. Don't you have anything to tell me? How are things going at school? Good. Why? Good? What happened to your shoes? They're soaked and worn... Where have you been? Have you been to the bog, Elina? - Were you there all by yourself? - No... How will we be able to afford new shoes? How could you be so careless? I'm going to have a word with your teacher. -Last year Irma got a pair of shoes. -Used ones. Tora Holm is kind. You need to keep in her good graces. Go get us a crate. - God's peace, Marta. - God's peace, Sara. I hear that your daughter is as courageous as her father. Take good care of her. God's peace, Marta. Excuse me, Miss Holm. Last year my youngest daughter received winter shoes. Perhaps we could discuss this some other time, Mrs. Jatko. When I have more time. We have a great deal to discuss. Isn't that so, Elina? Do you know what Miss Holm wants to discuss with me? Are you lying to me, Elina? You mustn't lie. Hello, how about a lift? - Thank you, but our crate... - No problem. Oh no, I need a hand... Hop into the car, Elina. - No, Elina... - It's all right. Step on the pedal to the right when I tell you to. Don't touch any levers, though. Elina and I'll have it up and running in no time. Now, Elina. Push down harder. - Harder. - Push harder, Elina. Harder! Yes! Good! That's good! Step on the brakes! Hit the brakes! - Hit the brakes! - How? Step... on the pedal in the middle. My dear little Elina... What kind of a man would put a girl in danger like that?! That's what happens when adults don't take charge. But maybe that's fine with you? That children are in charge? But I can assure you that the people of this town don't agree with you! We'll arrange for some shoes, I'll take care of the matter. Thank you... Thank you very much. And now for Elina... Are you all right? What's wrong? You ask me that? Miss Holm told me the whole story. About your refusing to eat. The entire village knows about it. Every one knew but me. I never thought you could be so ungrateful. You're just like your father... Do you know what this is? A school schedule? It's a life work, that's what it is. It symbolizes our duty: To bring order into this wilderness. Miss Holm, my daughter would like to apologize. Now isn't that nice... That's good. You may leave us, Mrs. Jatko. We'll settle this matter ourselves. - Don't worry. - Thank you. Well? She's certainly not apologizing... I can't be held responsible for her refusal to eat. The child's been ill with consumption, for goodness sake! She takes no heed of me, and she doesn't intend to obey her mother. Please talk some sense into her. Own up to your responsibility. Come on... Don't just stand there, talk some sense into her. Elina, I think we should... be smart and sensible. At times you have to swallow your pride - - and simply apologize... Could you apologize and put this behind you? As you wish. As of now, She simply doesn't exist to me. Miss Holm... - Good morning, class. - Good morning, Miss Holm. You may be seated. Let's put away our books during the quiz. Could anyone tell us about the murder o f King Gustavus III? Who were his betrayers? Well... Doesn't any one know the answer? That's not very impressive. - Has anyone done their home work? - Elina. Since nobody has the answers, I guess we'll have to turn to page 47. Anton, you're fond of telling stories. You may begin. ''In connection with the parliament of 1789... ...Swedish noblemen - - felt hostile towards Gustavus III.'' Yes... - Go on, Anna. ''Throughout the land noblemen conspired - - to take the life of the tyrant king and restore freedom.'' Thank you, Anna. Your pronunciation is excellent. My Daddy taught me. Now it's Kerttu's turn. I would like you to read the textbook - - and see that Kerttu is reading correctly. ''The deed was to be carried out - - by Captain Anckarstrom - - a hard and dissatisfied man who despised the King.'' Speak up, Kerttu. - And everyone should be reading along. ''On March 16, 1792 - - a masquerade ball was held...'' Go on, Kerttu, you read very well. ''At first, the wound was not considered to be deadly - - but things took a turn for the worse and two weeks later...'' Perhaps Irma should continue. Loud and clear, now. - Miss Holm, I think that Elina... - Read aloud from the book, Irma. May I have a word with you? Where was she headed? Is she sick? Did she have to go home? And who would that be? If anything happens to her, then who is responsible? Is everyone supposed to run after that girl? - I think I know where she went. - Where is that? The bog. Don't be sad, Daddy, I'm going to stay here with you. I'II be with you... Forever and ever... Forever... Elina! Come back here this minute! Elina! Come back here this minute! Come back here... Let's all turn back. That should put an end to her antics. Go on, the school day isn't over yet. She can't hurt us, Daddy. She wouldn't dare come here. Hurry up! Keep moving, don't stop... I know, Daddy, I know... I haven't forgotten... Please Daddy, you have to help me! Daddy! Why are you home this early? Does it have anything to do with Elina? Where is she? Don't worry, we'll help you. Keep still, Elina. Don't move. Run for help, Irma! We need something sturdy to stand on. Elina, why did you come here? You know it's dangerous. I didn't want him to be here all alone. Who? Do you mean your father? So you think this is where he is? It feels like someone's pulling me down, maybe it's Daddy. Maybe he doesn't want to be alone anymore. I'm like him, a troublemaker. And they come to a bad end. Children of the heavenly Father Safely in His bosom gather... Dear little Elina! Your dad didn't die because he was a troublemaker. He was ill and he wouldn't rest. He was headstrong and courageous, just like you. Then why doesn't anyone want me to be like him? I called for him... But he wasn't here. He was gone... Dead. Daddy would never abandon you. But that's what he did. He got sick and went away. He wanted to live. He didn't want to leave you. Do you understand? I want you to be like him. No! Hello! Don't run. Keep moving, just don't run. Why don't you come along to the cemetery tomorrow? After school. What's going on? Come back! I said, come back! Do something! So you're man enough. I didn't expect as much from you. Tell them to come back in. This business has gone too far, way too far. I expect I'll be blamed because that girl nearly drowned in the bog. Hi girls. Hi there. Elina... I would like to apologize. I have been unfair... ...and I've behaved badly. Even though my intentions were good. I'm asking you... ...to take your sister with you... ...and eat your lunch. Then you can grow strong and do well in life. Mom... How did you know how to cross the bog? Did Daddy teach you, too? I taught him. He didn't grow up in these parts. I taught him all about the bog and the woods. And when you were older he only wanted to bring you along. And I had Irma to take care of. Then it was you who taught Daddy and me both. I guess you could put it that way. I'll be right with you. Bye-bye, Daddy... Hi there! Want a ride? Right, I'll do the driving, so there's nothing to worry about.
