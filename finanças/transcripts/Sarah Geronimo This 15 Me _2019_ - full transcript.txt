[inaudible dialogue] [Sarah] Faith... is when you free yourself... from all the worries... hate... and insecurities. And just... let go. I will not be afraid... for God is with me. His will...

When I started working with her, she's complete... [Annie] Sarah started as... as an artist. Of course, we know, she won a contest. [announcer] The star for a night is... Sarah Geronimo, champion. And although I am not yet included in the picture, I did observe her hunger. She wants to do a lot of things. She has dreams that you see that she often tries all things that she can possibly do. ♪ To show you that my love Will never end ♪ -Breathe. -Actually, Ms. K, let's work on Bar 13. -Bar 13. Yes. I will set... -So, 13? A very good start for all artists is that they should imitate first. Slowly, as she already has her own concerts, oftentimes, she still imitates. But when I came in the picture... I observed that she imitates, when she imitates, she always put her own version. Hello? You're just late. [Louie] How did we prepare for the show? A lot of meetings. Trying to pin down what would be the right song. [Annie] Sarah takes regular lessons, voice lessons. I think the biggest input that we worked with is from day one, the songs that were included. "How Could You Say" or "Forever"? -Both. -Then let's make it. What, how to treat the song, and what or how Louie would work on it. It was-- It was a very-- Collaboration was intense. Intense collaboration. You know, she has a lot of input. There are a lot of factors. We need to finalize the music, you know that. Hands on-- I am hands on for, for, not for the first time, but I am more... This is the show that I really want... I really know what I am doing and I really love what I am doing. How did I prepare Sarah for this concert? We did, uh-- We did a lot of sessions. She has some private sessions at G-Force Dance Center prior to the actual rehearsal. So, she strengthen her stamina and her endurance. And then, after that, this is it, the process of rehearsal. I really need to give my time, all of my ideas, whatever in my mind, I'm really sharing with them. The reason why I put it in there because I feel that something is lacking in sexiness... It's also like a little jazzy. My choreography is already challenging. My musicality is also leveled up, the genre, the song lineups.

I really love the music and also the different genres of music. I don't want to take it for granted or I don't want to be put in a box. I don't want to be stuck in only one genre, in one image or viewed as a stereotypical pop star so you're expected to sing top hits, top-40s or pop songs. I don't want to be put in a box because I really love music. This is the first time that we're seeing her trying to put her mark into everything that she's doing. Regardless whether it's music, whether it's a dance performance, even to the visual, so she's trying to put her mark. So, I think in that particular aspect, Sarah has evolved into a pop star princess into now an artistic pop star. [man] Technical crew, let's all stand by. -[woman] Director? -[man] Yes, teacher. -[woman] We'll go now from the top. -[man] Five, four, three, two, one. This is the first time that we've been doing it for-- For the past years, um, the only setup you will see is probably a first layer stage. So, this time, you have a two-layer stage and it's very technical because we have a lot of musicians upstairs. We have Sir Louie Ocampo, and the rest of the strings component. [singing indistinctly] In terms of the visuals and the lights, physically, you're lighting a quarter of a whole dome. So, this is the outfit for the infamous production number "Tala." It's made by a local designer, Martin Bautista. So, very tribal, but the silhouette is not commonly used. It's like a bib, and then it has a body suit that is super shorts inside. And this one, this is from the L.A. designer that is Michael Ngo. He's Vietnamese actually, but based in Hollywood. So, Michael Ngo makes the wardrobe of J. Lo, Demi Lovato, Ariana Grande, and recently, Nicki Minaj. I am happy because he allows me to dress Sarah. I love Sarah 'cause she's different from the other artists. Sarah's fans have no age limit, be it a kid or older people, everyone loves her because she's really great. No one is on her level. Nobody comes close to her. We are Sarah's fans because she is our inspiration. You know, after 15 years, she didn't show any bad image to her fans, that's why I am a super fan of Sarah. -We love you, Sarah. -We love you, Sarah. -Pop star forever. -Pop star forever. Sarah! Sarah! Sarah! [Sarah] I am super fulfilled and excited.
