[♪] Well, we're all set. Ain't love grand? Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo. Yeah. Come on, let's get the car. Come on, Friday. [CAR ENGINE STARTS] [MOTOR SQUEAKS AND PUTTERS] [HONKS HORN] [TIRES SQUEAL] Wanna mess me up, eh? I ought to... [ALL SIGH] [SNEEZES] Come on. [COUGHS] [KNOCK AT DOOR] There they are. Come in. Corabell. Florabell. Dorabell. For the hundredth time... ALL: Will you marry us? This is so sudden. You'll have to ask Father. [GROANS] Ooh! Mr. Bell, can we marry your--? No. Ooh! He can't do that to us. Ooh! Are you three guys still here? Sure, and we intend to stay until you say yes. Hm! It's a sit-down strike! Oh. Ooh! Whoo. Why, I'll have you thrown out of this house. Is that so? Tell him a few syllables. Whoa! You can't do that to us. We're not interfering with interstate commerce. And we're gonna sit right here. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Ah! [GASPS] Hey, Moe, Larry. It's got me! It's biting me! Moe! What is it? I think it's an octopus. Get it. Easy, now. Oh! Whoa! Hey, wait a minute. [GRUNTS] [SCREAMS] Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Easy, now. The last one. [GRUNTS] You all right? How do you feel? [SIGHS] [SCREAMS] You fellas sit down. I'll picket. Come and get it! I can't. I think I got a bite. Didn't I tell you not to fish for those pets? But I had two strikes. Well, here's a third one. Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! You almost put me out. [WHISTLE BLOWS] Go get the mail. Thanks. Hey, our fan mail's growing. Oh, boy. Handle that. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Look, here's a real-estate company gonna give us a lot as soon as we're married. And here's the guy will give us a ready-cut house. Boy, a house and lot for nothing. What are we waiting for? For Papa to say yes, pudding head. Ooh! But governor, they've been sitting in my house for three weeks. You've got to get them out. Oh, he'll do nothing. Well, there's nothing the justice of the peace can do, then. Oh, yes, there is. Furniture! Oh, look, a set of dishes. And here's some silverware. And a baby carriage. Whoo-whoo! What do you got? A gas bill. Oh, what's the matter with you? There they are, sheriff. We ain't done nothing. You can't arrest us. I'm not going to arrest you. I'm gonna marry you. We won the strike! Now we can get married. [ALL CHEER] Hey, wait a minute! Quiet. Who's gonna marry who? Why, we're gonna... Oh, we never thought of that. Gee... I got an idea. Get those name pins. Pardon me, Justice. Take one. I got Florabell. Honey! [GIGGLES] [BONES CRACK] Darling. I got Corabell. Oh, darling! I get Stetson. Which one is she? Come on. Here. There. Ooh! MOE: This is it, driver! You better stop! Wow! Well, here we are. All right, women and children first. Out of the way! Well, there's where your new home's gonna be, girls. Where's the carpenters? There ain't any. You build it yourself. No carpenters? Well, we ain't gonna build nothing. We're on our honeymoon. Certainly. I got married so I could retire. But you must build the house first, darling. Nothing doing. I said we're on our honeymoon. Certainly. Oh, now, darling. Tootsie-wootsie. Little snookie-puss. ALL: Oh! The honeymoon starts when the house is finished. Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo. You come down from there and get to work! Nothing doing. We're staying right here. I'll bring them down. Ah! Hey, not that. Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo! Now, you snap out of it and get to work. But we was going down to-- You start a fire for breakfast and we go to the store. Get going. BOTH: Ow! [SCREAMS] They did it. Oh, we didn't, darling. Strike me, would you? Oh, you brute! Now, go on out and get a board so we can prop this up. Okay. Hurry up. Ow! Ow! Ow! What did you let go for? Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck nyuck, nyuck-- Oh! Hey! What's the idea, you ruining cement? [GROWLS] Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Ow! [GROWLS] [WHIMPERS] Oh! Hey, Larry, help me! My finger's caught! Are you sure? I'm sure. I can't get it out. That's all I want to know. Ow! Oh! Ow! I'll kill you! I'll break this guy a-- ALL: Hey, come here! What are you doing? LARRY: No, no, take it easy. Wait a minute, Moe... Hey! No, you don't! No, you don't! No! Whoo! Hey! You double-crossed me. [GROWLS] Ow! Hurry up with that board. You've been at it all morning. There's nothing ready-cut about these houses. Every board is too long. If that pudding head hadn't burned the plans, we'd have saved plenty of work. Hey, fellas, help me out. I'm stuck. What's the big idea? Somebody hit me on the head with a keg of nails. When I came to, here I was. I knew I missed a keg of nails. But it didn't miss me. Fellas, help me get out of here, will you? Don't worry, we'll have that stuff off you in a jiffy. Oh, thanks. Not over there, now. I got a corn on that side. Who's doing this? Here, that stuff's too hard. Try this. That's an idea. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Look out for my corn, now. [DRILL GRINDS] Oh! Ooh, that's my foot. What are you yelping about? I had to see it was through, didn't I? Get the dynamite. I knew we'd have to use it for something. Dynamite? Hey, you're not gonna blast. What would you do? I'd blast. There, that didn't hurt, did it? I don't know. My foot's asleep. Here. What's the idea? One stick in each block's enough. Listen, I don't want to butt in, but don't you think half a stick is enough? No. You got nothing to worry about. Besides, dynamite always blows down. Oh, I didn't know that. Have you out of these like that. Come on. Get behind the lumber pile. You better hurry. See you later. Hey, Moe! Hey, Larry! Maybe I could take my shoes off. Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo- whoo-whoo-whoo. Listen, fellas, I got a better idea. Take these out... [BOTH SCREAM] Hey, listen, fellas, don't be so mean! [EXPLOSION] He was right. A half a stick would have been plenty. Yeah. Gee, he was a swell guy. You know, I think I'll let him keep that dollar he owes us. Have you nothing to do but play with firecrackers? Where's Curly? Well, it started with the cement... CURLY: Hey, Moe! Hey, Larry! Hey, Moe! Hey, Larry! Here I am. Come get me. There he is. Forget what I said about that dollar. Whoo-whoo! Come and get me. MOE: Here we come. Who said dynamite blows down? Come down out of there, Tarzan. I can't. I'll get you down. Look out, now. Look out-- [CHOKES] Ooh! Ooh! Ah-ha-ha! Whoa! Dorabell, are you hurt? Dorabell. Oh! How are you? Hey, get some water, quick. Look! Look at Dorabell. Oh! Come here. Look at her. Say something. Say something. Not much, but say something. Look at me, it's Curly. I fell down too, but I'm walking now. Hurry up with that water. Whoo-whoo. Look, she's coming to. Oh! I didn't mean it, Dorabell. Honestly. I didn't-- Look what you did! What's the idea hitting my sister-in-law with cement? Oh! What'd you hit my brother-in-law for? CURLY: Say, I think there's something wrong with this door. Looks all right to me. LARRY: Hey, fellas. The plumbing's all through. That's great. Well, she's all finished. Now for the honeymoon. Boy, will the women love this. Oh, honey. Darling. Angel. Well, here's your love nest. Ain't it a beaut? How do you like it? Why, it's beautiful. Oh, it's marvelous. Uh, but, uh, where do those steps go? Steps? Why, those are shelves. Shelves? Well, here's a post that shouldn't be here. [♪]
