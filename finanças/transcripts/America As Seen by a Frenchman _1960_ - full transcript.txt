Reichenbach's film proves that despite robotism, depersonalisation the threat of plural over singular, invasion of the barracks and a symmetry equal to death there lies everywhere surprises, excesses, wonderful disorders an instinctive disobedience to rules which saves us from boredom and preserves for the world the strange asymetrical beauty of the human figure America as seen by a frenchman I traveled America for 18 months I was allowed everywhere even in prisons Nothing of what you will see has been reconstituted I wanted to show America's rules and rituals this appetite for youth and freedom without which a film such as this could not have been made San Francisco, August 30th We enter America throught the golden door. The Golden Gate Bridge. They say it stretches the city like the virgin?s thread The thread is sturdy It is also workable A thousand cars move across at a regular pace We drive This bridge is a starting point that we chose, perhaps because of its great size the size of the country it pours onto Here begin all journeys to all possible Americas And all are possible The one that produces the one that thinks the one that worries or the one that tempts It?s the moment of decision to wander in a setting which as beautiful as it is is only distraction or to close our eyes give up all ready-made ideas and let ourselves fall into the deep American body And then, only then open our eyes and wait for men to appear This is when we rode across some men and horses a strange carriage that seemed to come from a childhood dream When dawn came, they were there they filled the horizon Where are they going to, who are they? They are simple folks from Houston Most of them work in offices but once a year they rent horses borrow carriages from the museum and begin a sort of pilgrimage on the old route of salt Nostalgia for a time of adventure drives them For three days and nights, they will be pioneers Indians have almost disappeared but their memory is still alive Their history started here In these camps where men braved cold and fear So that their kids might come and kiss here in a night without ambush One spring morning, very early On an empty beach of Santa Monica models have to suggest the pleasures of summer They don?t know each other an agent brought them together And suddenly, a secret accord professional sense or are they caught at their own game? On a record cover they will be tied forever To glorify a certain view of happiness is the first rule of American publicity This is why so much work is put into it Photographers are the Sunday painters of modern America Cigarettes, camping gear, toothpaste, cars are portrayed just as donators in primitive paintings Another principle of publicity: recreate life with movement In a flash the photographer will design the cover of a calendar intended for GIs It is in studios that America creates tall women painted like pharaohs trained like horses will fix for the entire world the universal canon of beauty and of the year This skier is also a model We are in Cypress Garden paradise of amateur photographers They don't seem to mind taking the same picture which is by the way also available on postcards For a moderate price, we can also photograph world beauties or harvest unattended the forbidden orchid In each American there is a photographer And in each photographer there is a tourist Don?t be surprised to see them travel without looking around Their Kodak is their memory Back in their living room album on the knees they will relax they will begin to love the world they will start to travel When they travel in their own country Do they see the same America? These frozen landscapes? Those odd inventions which make us feel from a different planet Do they still smell this wilderness? Or do they share the impression that those vast horizons are still waiting for something? The invasion of Martians or the return of pioneers? Half machine half insect with this abiltiy to hover above ground and ponder with their mandibles Pioneers have come back The plain is not countryside but an immense desert that let itself be tamed by those engineers of the earth America has 9 millions farmers but not one peasant Tender Mississippi of musical boats Walt Disney recreated it at the scale of children 25 000 people per day visit this universe of automatons Here Indians don?t scalp Fire doesn?t burn At once history book, farce, fair and zoo It is a reduction of the world, of fairy tales where fake hippos scare real children And at night, the boat comes obediently back home for it's guided by rails America has thousands of artificial worlds Close to Los Angeles is a museum consecrated to the heroic Far West Your rail ticket includes a masked robbery and an attack on the postal wagon Hollywood Extras play their role assiduously and animate this ghost town We ride across the dream of a town breathe in a dream of adventure and sit with a dream of adultery Here everything is reconstituted but this woman is of the period She?s the last survivor of the civil war She?s 104 years old Old fiddlers have also come back to relive the spirit of the past And become without knowing the truest characters of this museum Real faces start to resemble cartoon characters Drawing artists have nothing left to invent You want the real grandmother keeper of the bible and the apple pie? Here she is Walt Disney has only to sign her We are in a cell This man committed two murders He is in for a hundred years In the prison of Huntsville, Texas is the convicts rodeo Guests arrive They are inmates from nearby towns all wearing white from cotton they weaved We arrived in this strange ceremony where the most dangerous criminals were searched right in front of us The stadium is in the prison?s perimeter It seats 25 000 people They come from far to assist to this rodeo, known to be fierce The most fanatic spectators are recruits from military school And the game starts There is probably no game in the world with such high stakes The prize is a remission of sentence Like the matador killing death the prisoner rides his own freedom After the show each one regains his cell Under the collar is inscribed the number that identifies them Last generosity of Huntsville for each, a hot dog in the right hand and in the left a hamburger Part of the profit will go to their relief fund the rest to the construction of churches Provided for, in the present future and eternity prisoners regain their cells Each brings back from this event a strange souvenir First prize won a year in remission the second a week with his wife What did he win this one? The memory of being clown for a day Huntsville unbreakable prison but without filth or rust A prison without contempt A small America behind bars where they can bank money or buy from the drugstore Life goes on with its perpetual need to produce For the prisoners world this weaving For the world of freedom these car plates Here hope is never completely lost This giant ice cream adorned like a bride is this American boy?s first love story the centrifugal pizza also has its ceremony it dances in the air the ballet of seduction Not far from there Tom Dick and Harry celebrate their common majority together, they are 21 years old They were three little children that ate more than elephants There will be left of those days Only this song by Michel Legrand These little twins without malice have their future in publicity We are driven to optimism When we see them eat their meal It seems to you a funny career In America it's mighty well paid Because in that foreign country You earn your bread by eating away My little sister is not happy She won?t have any dessert Sometimes a meal becomes a party or a competition The first to finish their Myrtle pie will do the melon contest On every sunny weekend there is a giant barbecue At Christmas, 53 million turkeys and ten times that of chickens are walked to the consumer And yet sometimes a miracle Look at this hen. It is unique. A breeder's publicity trained to play bowling The gist of the game is that grain will only come if all pins are up The hen knows when it's useless to go get the grain Pins first This hen saved by publicity Will never find its prey but through its shadow This is what we call a conditioned reflex This gracious person is she pin or grain? We will not decide She is anyhow a good example of conditioning Her role is to advertise for rescue equipment We count on the client?s subconscious to put away the girl with the apparatus and vaguely expect her to appear on our stretcher in case of a fire hence our trust hence a few callings of incendiary But we need to specify that she has a husband and he's a wrestler Here publicity is more solemn Even so, it is only the opening of a gymnasium where this golden athlete is a teacher And as always, majorettes join in Majorettes are a national institution No publicity parade no electoral campaign no manifestation without them Their role is to raise crowds If in every girl there is a Majorette In each young man there is a musician Each university, school, sports team has an orchestra that parades in uniform with military precision Here, two sports come together football and insurrection Cheerleaders are here to direct the crowd?s uproar Every gesture has a clear significance and motivates the public to motivate the team The same energy leads them whether to defend the team?s colors or the colors of America On an aircraft carrier close to Hawaii we were left alone with those men of the future drunk on space and science fiction Those young men who are taught to conquer fear by playing with death Go back with a simple joy to the events of daily life At the Red Cross the same men take free classes to prepare for fatherhood Don?t think they're serious they?re as amused as you are to be in this situation Americans never miss a chance to go to school Any age is good to learn It?s the best way to stay young After three weeks of classes they will graduate as fathers Technicians and space travelers learn the careful handling of babies Cheerfully perhaps finding there a reality that no progress can change Because according to Dr. Von Braun it would be wrong to assume that with nine women we could get a child in one month Everything is ready to welcome this baby which shows up in America every eleven seconds To prove it, let?s count together: eleven, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero An American has been born On the hospital?s television he comes to his father like a news flash the latest news We are in a hospital of Hialeah, Florida Only just born, he will be filed according to weight and height kept from germs in one of those incubators where he will ripen like a melon until he has gained sufficient weight Newborns go rapidly from being watched by television To watching television which by the way has special programs for babies What is the name of the river going through Paris? It?s the...the Seine. It?s the Seine. Name the colors please Yellow, orange purple, chestnut, grey... And so begins the golden age of American life: childhood As soon as he walks, a child spends all day with neighbors He is given full independence so he doesn't become a cry baby obsession of all American parents The first Hula Hoop contests happened under police care For a while now parents were worried A whole generation in front of television heading towards anchylosis Their only effort was to choose between a western and a cartoon And here comes this novelty Police took matters into their hands and started to distribute records and Hula Hoops Kids followed the lead the race was saved A golden age is this moment when wonder has come bare when believing in miracles makes them come true when pigeons fly horses fly angels fly humans fly After the golden age: the nickel age A child, no matter his parents wages must win his own pocket money After school, he distributes the evening paper It is a scene which occurs everyday in all provincial towns Newspapers are deftly thrown other kids collect them eager to know the latest news Not about those imaginary characters called Ike, de Gaulle or Khrushchev But about the real heroes of this world: Pogo, Superman Dick Tracy or little orphan Annie For children, the national event is the Soap Box Derby fought every year in Acron, Ohio The day starts, of course with a brass band and majorettes Then comes the long-awaited moment the race begins Boys between 8 and 14 built these cars by themselves from identical materials planks, wheels and nails that the tire society gave them Preliminaries selected two boys in each state The winners will get a scholarship and a job when they?re twenty as engineer in one of the tire factories that sponsor the event Here come the holidays As in any country, boys love to run after what?s forbidden But here, they won?t be punished Parents let their kids get bruises to avoid those lumps of the soul: hang-ups The fastest runner, the most daring will the the most admired Waiting for real life to begin the brain takes a rest And as blindmen think with their hands Americans think with their bodies The beach in Santa Monica is called Muscle beach In french, la plage du muscle He is trying to cover his shadow Beaches facilitate transitions As from childhood to adolescence From the chaotic world of children to the ones called teenagers, 13 to 20 For whom childhood gestures suddenly change meaning On summer afternoons adolescent bodies seek each other and give themselves We talk very little Verbal language is not how boys and girls communicate They have a more secret, more heathen language of their own Summer gone, college begins Free college where rich and poor meet and blend in American democracy For boys, there is a future to think of, and exams For girls also, of course But they must put other aces up their sleeves up their legs and smiles Friendship made them fond of boyish games of a reality that will give way to love and America is filled with young girls running to happiness Majorette school teaches the scales of seduction which resemble in a way the rituals of birds and insects On school ground without seeming to begins the offensive leading to marriage each sides are watching The lucky girls will not be the most learned, pretty or clever but the ones most resembling Miss America who resembles all American girls To be chosen, Miss America must have all the virtues of a young girl She must also be strong In Judo school, defensive strategy is the last step in a liberal education Defensive strategy which may just be a disguised form of offensive To find a parody of seduction we go to a striptease school in L.A. Of course, Americans did not invent naked women But they were the first to give them academic training Here we learn with great skill the complex rules behind this solemn frustration Students learn of the subtle line between bold moves and those sanctioned We are always weary of a border incident of an unclear boundary a disputed territory If we dare say, of a no man's land Striptease has a code And so depending on the city limits of shamelessness lie on different rules Who takes this class? Beginners or professionals in want of perfection who thought of Luther's say that to conquer evil one sometimes needs to steal its weapons Baffling America No other country has as much respect for marriage And yet we find in a parking lot a chapel dispensing for couples in a rush a fixed rate ceremony For small fee, a lady standing in for family will throw good luck rice on the newlyweds Honeymoon Baffling America These concrete tents those motels that proliferate make it hard to believe that Americans are traditionally bound to the intimacy of home Like attracts like America produces enough twins to hold a congress every year in Huntington For the pleasure of assembling and resembling Stilt houses and boardwalks This surprising place is Fire Island Where cats and dogs are holding their own congress Here are the major races of American society The dog race: kind, sociable a little too excitable And the cat race: secretive righteous and dark whose watchfulness reveals a hoard of movement and violence These sons of violence those felines have an ideal To escape from everyday life They are American Gypsies They ride the country following seasons like migratory birds The world of bikers created heroes, myths Leather, boots and guitars are both emblem and gathering call Elsewhere, fanatics gather to wait for Hot Rods In french: piston brulant With old frameworks junk parts, boosted engines lovers of speed and mechanics made these machines that reach a 150 mph Racing is a tranquilizer for those young men reduced all week to 50 mph Faster than the wind faster than blood in my veins faster that sap in a tree faster than Mississippi waters said James Dean America resonates with games of violence mechanical violence Across the country, cars flame up motorcycles fly roller coasters spin Thin line between pleasure and torture In other days, these would be instruments of pain In all these activities accidents are accidental but they had to make it deliberate the ragtime of dead ends, of catastrophes defying the devil a game for Hell Drivers To boost our national pride these men from Kansas call themselves The Parisians Here's one of those Parisians from fair to fair doing the same number As if this society based on comfort found genuine pleasure in seeing baffled and destroyed the symbols of that comfort Here the ceremony is over Kids learn that cars can die They say she's an Italian princess We'll never why she was there going through waste looking for souvenirs perhaps We'll never know precisely what she was doing We'll know nothing also of these drowned vehicles At dawn, by the Mississippi in New Orleans While fog dissipates Characters wait for the boat of a Negro king That will open the black carnival Nearby is the white carnival We saw blackmen dressed as negroes Here's women dressed as naked women But if bodies have fake skins souls are bare Far from worn-out carnivals where we dress up out of habit All of its violence is there A travesty, a mask is a confession All day the carnival played its obscene lament In a few hours, Ash wednesday. Everything must be back to normal At nightfall the strangest characters began to appear In the dark, adolescents wait Waiting that sometimes leads to stealing and crime as if to feed something inside with the only thing they've never tasted: punishment At Houston police station: identification of a suspect Six boys are suspects in a garage theft In the shadow a witness will single one out There That's him Each night a dozen boys line up guilty of mild crimes but also of irrational, violent ones Here they have all vices laziness, brutality and worse of all: sadness In obstinate silence they tell their parents That all is not well, not simple Their gang tells of a need for community their cruelty, the need for a loved one In a void that they couldn't fill men raise these absurd animals Those too tough to go home spend time in a cell It doesn't touch them They have the patience of a rock and it's indifference Our presence doesn't seem to surprise them or irritate them They are elsewhere On the road But the prisoner's dream is short-lived It dissipates at daybreak with the strange ceremony of a meal for guilty children America believes in prophets when they speak the bible But the muteness of these youths within the clamor of those speaking God's name might just be His silence the only language left In this country that seems so content with paradise on earth We sometimes felt a desire to be elsewhere the call of the unseen of a new America to be discovered This America, is it at the end of the desert or at the end of life? Infinite are the roads leading to God and to salvation Holy Rollers are Christians Temples of this sect are open to all Followers are believers wanting to chase with this Holy rolling a demon from their soul Elsewhere, other cults light up This need to give physical form to religious fervor created in America this ballet of lights We had found it in the world of advertising Commerce seems an excuse for the creation of beauty And beauty itself is more than pleasure It is an offering to the Gods The American night with its comets and imaginary zodiac is full of these offerings And we ride to Las Vegas with its galaxies of Casinos That our speed animates like a procession coming to us Las Vegas, a city made of lights born in the middle of the desert is the capital of game and chance Chance: a prisoner in its cell the little boy with an ice cream the negro during carnival the young girl with her plans Chance. Their chance. Given to all citizens at birth That each one carries with him like a token of happiness always within reach whatever happens In Las Vegas where gambling is legal 8 million people every year speak directly to chance where a dollar is its sign and slot machines are praying mills San Francisco, Louisiana, Texas America, if I didn't loose myself in your maze It is because I didn't try to understand or deduce or explain It is because, in a way I have loved you, simply New York, they say you have no heart or past In your reflections I found treasures, cathedrals New York, November 18 We leave America The one we saw. Because there are as many Americas as people Each one discovers something that they keep for themselves And we almost consider this country a superstore the slogan of which would be If you don't know what you want come on in, we have it But it would be easy to say that America is strange This way of life, so criticized but so imitated Is the art of giving to man's will what he though was his fate It might be all of Europe in twenty years And if it is to be ours perhaps was it worthwhile to consider it well
