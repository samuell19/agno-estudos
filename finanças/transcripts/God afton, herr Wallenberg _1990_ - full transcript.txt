GOOD EVENING, Mr. WALLENBERG A passion story from reality Black-out? In the middle of the day? Business trip, Central Europe, 1943 Kill him! Kill him! Stockholm, June, 1944 These two want you... but I'm not convinced. Pity... It's not a pleasant task. No. But you're attracted? Yes. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as the Americans, appoint you. - Do you know why? - Yes. Because my name is Wallenberg. So you've understood that. Yes, it's a well-known family. You haven't made a name for yourself. Are you an idealist, Mr. Wallenberg? No. Do you believe in God? No. Have you got political views? No. Have you been engaged in questions of national or humanitarian kind? What is your present profession? Delicatessen from Hungary, Germany. It's a waste of time talking to you. Your questions are insolent. Yes, but what do I know about him? Mediocre grades in school. Good at drawing. His education is that of a financier at the highest level. And what came out of it? A man who imports delicatessen. Trained as an architect in the USA. And what came out of it? Say something... Mr. Wallenberg. Am I completely wrong... to consider you far too mediocre for this assignment? - No, I am mediocre. - So you decline it. Absolutely not, I'm going. Have you understood that it's a mediocre person... they want? You know, even the Germans have approved. They'll give you a visa. You'll be as efficient as the Germans will allow you to be. It'll be convenient for them that you save 500 Jews with American money. As some kind of charity. Then they can kill the other 200000 left. I want someone else. Someone that understands what it's all about. - I'll go. - It's our decision, not yours. It should be, but it's my decision. I can't explain why. - You might not survive. - No, I understand that. And it doesn't frighten you? I'm acquainted with death. My father died before I was born. I've been talking with a dead person every day since I was 5 years old. A few years ago... I was sitting in the dining car on the train from Hungary. We arrived at a station at the same time as a freight train, probably on its way to Auschwitz. Sure I can have one profession as well as another. I can sure live in one country as well as in another, and be... ...married to one woman as well as to another. Everything is replaceable. You were talking about a freight train? Yes, they threw out dead people... among them - a boy. And then I saw a man who... the boy's father... he jumped out of a wagon, that had started to roll, to lift up the boy. And then they shot the father? Yes, of course they shot him. Do you understand, if I tell you that it's the only real thing I ever saw. He seems to be one of the efficient ones. I hate them. The efficient... Look at the way he walks. It is... Raoul Wallenberg. - A German? - Sweden. Budapest, December 1944. Put something on for Christ's sake, Maria! - You could bury him. - You've lost your dignity, Maria. - Cover yourself. - I've lost my dignity. I've lost my dignity... - Are they coming tonight? - Yes. Are you sure? Why are you here, Mr. Wallenberg? To check that everything goes right. You're here to prevent a massacre. You were here once before. They killed almost everyone. Tonight it'll be better. They killed some with their rifles. They didn't shoot, they just hit. Try to keep calm. Is that right? 2 weeks... Yes, that's right. What does it mean? That we can't get out. They'll come and get us. Let's be honest. We're going to die. Where could you go? Where can a Jew be in Budapest? We're allowed to stay shut up in the ghetto. Until now, no one has come out from the ghetto alive. Some live in the Houses of Sweden, in the Wallenberg-houses, in district 5. - But it isn't safe either. - That's unnecessary. Stop it! He's not from Budapest. He knows nothing about the situation here. But our house is here. Here they've forgotten us. We're a mistake... ...that they'll sooner or later will correct. We're practically already corpses. You don't have to worry. He's really incredible. He's been here but a few months... and has saved thousands. Sometimes one thousand at the same time... ...and we're only 20. Stop that. Stop that! Not even Eichmann can beat Raoul. Hey, children, do you know what he looks like? He's got an incredibly thin mouth. His lips are so thin that he cuts himself when he speaks. And together with his words... ...blood pour out of his mouth. But Raoul wasn't afraid of him. He invited him to dinner. And do you know what Raoul then did? He told Eichmann off! He said that he's insane, and that all thoughts that Eichmann has in his head are awful and stupid. Eichmann tried to answer him, but he cut his lips even more, until his whole mouth was all bloody. He tried to drink... coffee and brandy, but it was no good. Is it true? Sure, and much, much more. - Is it the man that's here? - Yes, it's him. You know that many women... fell in love with him, don't you? He was often seen with a very beautiful woman. She was certainly no princess.., but almost... A baroness! Elisabeth was her name. It was a very sad relationship... because the baroness was married. Your Swedish protective passports, please. Simon, Anna and Eva Levy. Don't be afraid, Madam. - Will they help us? - Yes, they will. I know... of some people... who had those, but despite that... They'll be of help. Bella Jacobi? And I am Klein Pal. - Isaac Kaminsky? - I haven't got one. Julia Rosen? Lilith Rosen? Sisters? - Yes. - Yes, we're sisters. Maria! Maria! You won't be raped. You're not that beautiful. You don't have to be disguised. She thinks that she's too beautiful. I think Wallenberg is leaving. What? Why are you staring at me? We want to get married. Now. We really want to get married. We want to get married here. It's hard to understand you. I'll take this. Are you crazy?! Dress up in red... It shines! Get married? Not before God... before you. If we lose each other... Tomorrow we will all be dead. You know Bella pretty well by now. How is it done? How is it done... ...here? There's a time for everything. Well, maybe not. All rise. In the red one you'll be shot... first. All rise! Maria, button up. God bless... - Shalom. - Shalom. Wallenberg has left. Neither he nor his car is here. Everyone in the Spanish Embassy has gone home. I'm the only one left. But I'm not even employed there. We have embassy stamps, flags, and official cars at our disposal. So the Spanish embassy... is me. Not bad for a Jew with false papers. Lies and duplicity lead to success. Authentic papers lead to death. The transfer is here. If they leave with the next train... they're dead. - How many have Swedish passports? - Five. 5 out of 25... We have to do it in less than 2 minutes. Otherwise it's no idea. Put on the fur cap. Without it you're lost. Now? Now! This is a terribly serious mistake for a minor official. - Schonberger! - Yes! Quiet! - Weiss? - Yes! Mr. Ormester! A labour battalion supposed to repair at the Swedish and Spanish Embassies. Repairs that can't be delayed. They have Swedish passports. Understood? - Fischer! - Yes! - Singer! - Yes! The repairs can't be delayed. Understood? Mr. Ormester! Fingelmann! Ullman? Yes, Ullman! - Fischer! - Check for yourself. I want the names of all your men. What are you up to? Answer me! - There should be... should be a... - Do we have to repair ourselves? How would that be? You're gonna pay for your lies. That was a very unusual transfer. Very unusual and you're gonna pay for it. You're totally unreliable. You don't say a single true word. One asks oneself if you know what honesty means. You were late. 30 seconds... If there were no walls... nothing would stop you. I'll tell you how to behave. They'll soon be here. You're as well-dressed as the murderers. Did the others tell you... that I'm crazy? Do they think I'll cause trouble? I'm here to tell you that you must stay calm when they come. - I'll sit here. - And follow them when they demand it. They're gonna shoot me here, from the front. They've already been here. They took my daughters. - Sorry, I didn't mean to... - I had two daughters. I have a cold. I thought I had got used to it. It was 10 weeks ago. It all happens so fast. It's unbelievable. I wore this last summer. It's unbelievable... In a few weeks it was all... The girls surely are somewhere in Budapest. I'll be naked. I'll be naked... ...so they understand that we are real. So they understand that we... have real hair, that we... have ordinary breasts, that we... That we have feet, knees, ordinary feet. They don't understand... that we live... and that they kill us. Do you understand? They simply don't understand it. What do you think? When will they be here? What do you think? This curtain is pointless. Please, let us go upstairs. It's too cold up there. And aside from that we must stay together. We must stay together. But it's our wedding night. Are you Wallenberg? Hush! He's resting. Is he Wallenberg? The real one? Yes, he is... He is Wallenberg. They are here. Something is wrong. They are too many. They'll soon be here. Put on your coat. I want you to survive. They're here. Remain calm! Hold your passports in your hands. All here have Swedish passports! All here have Swedish passports! Who is at command here? Come out! Come out! Oh, Mr. Wallenberg! With a Jewish friend. - Who is at command here? - I am. - Are you Hungarian? - The rest of the house is empty! Impossible! - Abort the operation! - Where are the others? - Where are all the others? - All here have Swedish passports. I heard you, Mr. Wallenberg, but I don't care. Are they really all here? I ask you to abort, and I ask you once again to introduce yourself. - You have no right to keep them. - Where are you taking them? No one opens that door. - Smash it in. - It's mined and guarded by children. We don't know who they are. Abort! It'll save your lives, too. I can have you shot. Everyone, out! Everyone, out! - You stay. - And you! You open the door. And you... kill her, if she doesn't obey. - Open the door. - You can't be serious. - Open it. - I'll open it. Open the door! Or else we'll die. Not the others. We'll die. Come out! You dare not shoot me. I represent... Your time in Budapest is over, Mr. Wallenberg. I could have you shot now, or someone else will have you shot tomorrow. And you won't introduce yourself? I?d like to know who's murdering me. No one is murdering you. You're the one who wants to open the door. Open, Mr. Wallenberg. Not another word!!, Mr. Wallenberg. It didn't explode. It didn't work. - Where are the others? - They left this afternoon. Something is wrong. I didn't request 2000 men. Maybe 200... - And him? - Not him either. The Hungarian police won't take part in any further military operations. I bear no responsibility for this operation. The motor is flooded. It won't start. Aaron Klein! - Rosa Langer! - I'm here. Thanks. It's because of the shitty petrol you gave us! It just won't start! The Jewish council. Help me. Help. Please help me. - My brother, what do you know? - My child, my family? Help... My sisters, my brothers... What do you know about them? Brokman... Please, stop it! Right away! Mr. Pete said that these phones are the best ones. Were! They've been out of order for a long time now. We're just acting as if everything is normal. It's like a dream. Do you know, Mr. Wallenberg, for how long we'll stay alive? I write lists. - Many lists. - Please don't talk to me. According to the volunteer rescue service, 162 in the ghetto committed suicide yesterday. While at the same time only 300 were killed by the Hungarian Nyilashists. Quick! In half an hour I won't be allowed to stay in the ghetto. Mr. Wallenberg! I don't like you, Mr. Wallenberg. You shouldn't say everything you think. What are you driving at? Excuse me, Mr. Wallenberg. I was thinking of the fact that you can leave through one of the doors. - I can't. - There's no reply. How is that possible? Forget the truck. It'll take 10, 20 people... - Here in the ghetto there are... - Quiet! - There are 65 000 people. - The truck is still there. You mustn't think as a normal human being, but as the murderers in order to understand them. Only you can get to know, if they have a plan ready to exterminate us. Get that information now. It could be set for tonight. Attention! You must all play ''Fur Ellse''. All of you! So that we can compare the pianos. Don't believe them! It's a lure! No one will get out of here alive! We'll all die here! Confounded idiots! Idiots! Cold water! Cold water! Attention! Only ''Fur Ellse''! Get out of here! It's utterly inconvenient to have you here. We're expecting a person of high station from the German Reich. He likes the 18th century and we're furnishing a suite for him. Who decided about the operation yesterday? You can unpack the paintings now. It was an unfortunate decision. We want... exclusively Watteau. Exclusively Watteau... French artist, 1684- 1721. - A series of misunderstandings. Go. - Misunderstandings? Are there plans to exterminate the ghetto? - For God's sake, go now. - Yes or no? Take a pot and give it to me. That isn't the 18th century, Mr. Wallenberg. Eichmann... Was it the beginning of a massacre? You'll have to ask those who planned it, not me. Yes or no? Answer me! I've given you 110 000 all in all! Your time in Budapest is over, Mr. Wallenberg. I heard that yesterday. Is there a decision to have me killed? Yes, I think so. Exclusively Watteau! Turn them this way, in the light! And the ghetto? Help me... Hold up the paintings, face-level! A genuine Watteau... will give you a pass and a ticket out of here! Yes, it's been decided to exterminate the ghetto. 65 000 people. With those in your protected houses - it's another 35 000. Face level... Face level! Mr. Wallenberg! Stay there! Everyone knows that the war will soon be over! We could talk business. You're tactics are ridiculous. Do you want to offer me money? Maybe you think that you're talking to a lower officer? I want your names and grades. Immediately! I've sent for another truck and it'll soon be here. This situation is absurd! Completely mad! Absurd, completely mad. The upper class is visiting... No one here will survive. Not a single person. You are a Swede... who temporarily has been in Budapest. Go home, Mr. Wallenberg. - Faster, Vilmos. - They have blocked the bridge. When they dynamite the bridges I'll move to Pest. Get back! Get back! - Right! Turn right! - Get back! Mr. Wallenberg! Mr. Wallenberg, please... Mr. Wallenberg! Mr. Wallenberg! Mr. Wallenberg! What happened? There's a turmoil. The Germans underestimated it all. We believe the Russians have broken through at Biecske. Raoul, they say that Eichmann has left. Hey! Listen! Don't go home tonight. Spend the night here. I return tonight to Pest. They will dynamite the bridges. Raoul... The ambassador will complain. You already employ 400 people. They can't sleep here as well. How did it go? - Are the phones functioning? - Yes. - Bella! - Yes. - Is it ready? - It's ready. What do you say about that? - What's ready? - A reconstruction plan. For all Jewish life in Hungary. I didn't think that... Thanks. They could just have written a tale. A tale?.. Bella thinks the Russians broke through here. Budapest is completely surrounded. There's a truck here. Tell Langlet to send a Red Cross car and to have it parked one metre away. They say Eichmann left. I never sleep at the same place. Make a list with addresses, so I know where to go. And don't show it to anyone! It's almost certain Eichmann left. Stop talking about Eichmann! If he left with his 13 officers... So what! The German army is still here. And the Hungarian Fascists won't leave. And all they want to do is to kill you. You could fight against Eichmann, but what do we do, if there's an Eichmann in every entrance? And they kill you in every crossing. The war will soon be over, Raoul. It's only the beginning. The Russians will conquer Budapest street by street. It will take long. Be careful! For the first time... I think I have an official death warrant over me. What can we do about that? Practically nothing. The two of us must leave tonight. She can have her baby any time now. It has to be done here. Close the doors, Josef. How? How can it be done here? I don't know, ask a doctor. - Who is a doctor? - I don't know! It can happen any time now. I can't handle it. We have to leave. The soup for the ghetto didn't come today. They stopped the milk at the gates. Close the door, Josef. Soup for 65 000 people can?t just disappear. Can't you get me warmer shoes? Joel! I'll be freezing in these tonight. Has the church got your 170 000? Raoul, Szamosi called! He says something happened with the truck. He wants you to come. Prepare food transports for tomorrow. 4 alternative routes. And we must keep the wire to the Red Cross warm. Joel! I want a suitcase with clothes and papers, embassy stamps and writing materials. It's your son. If he fires another shot, I'll kill half of you. Bring him out! Pal! Pal! - Did you shoot a soldier? - No, it came from that house. We just heard it. - Are they still alive down there? - Yes. I can't do anything for you here. Just get away from here. Bella doesn't dare to jump. Do as you like, but don't wait. If they get reinforcements... ...we'll die. Don't die, but... Do something quick! I told you to bring him down. There'll be no more shooting. He was dead. Your son is dead. Shall we believe that? Don't do anything stupid. - You should go now. - I appeal to you. - Let them all go. - All that you say is madness. - I appeal to you. Let them go! - All that you say... Firstly: You'll receive no further orders. That's obvious. Secondly: You can't stay here another night. Thirdly: No one will ever know anything about this operation. I must see... You're to blame for this execution... because of your presence here. We couldn't get a car from the Red Cross. Eichmann! Eichmann is in the ghetto. Tonight it will break out. Is there only one dairy van? It seems so. I can't handle it. Furthermore they've... ...given me shoes that are too small. I need to find a meaning with this. It doesn't work any longer. I think that... Maybe I'll go home. Come! Raoul... Allow me to escort you to the shelter in the cellar. It's no longer hard to imagine you're gonna die... A sad conversation on a beautiful night like this. I'm finished, Szamosi. To me everyone, except the victims, are mentally ill. I've had my time. Now it's over. Good evening, Mr. Wallenberg. Raoul... - Did anything happen with the truck? - No. We couldn't find any quarters for you tonight. No place secure enough. Doctor, it has started. - It has started. You can feel it. - What does he say? The milk didn't come through. I know. Your room up there is still free. Did you hear that they continue shooting people by the river. I don't want to hear anything. The time has come. Mr. Wallenberg, the time has come. Of course you'll have this room. I haven't slept in the sheets. - Mr. Wallenberg... I'm sorry. - It's all my fault. - I'm going to sleep, Mika. - Yes, I know. - What is it? - It's Szamosi. He says that he knows now. He nearly knows, he says. Raoul! Are you coming or not? If Eichmann really left Hungary, then the house is empty, right? He has left! He isn't here. He already belongs to the past. He had tea here this morning. Like a loss of memory... Adolf Karl Eichmann... He came here with 13 officers. Seven weeks later... 472 602 people were dead. But did anything really happen? After having killed half a million people, he went away and left a Christmas tree. Don't shoot. The real Adolf Eichmann is asked to come forward. That disguise won't fool anyone. Stop joking. It was no joke, Raoul. After having shot at Adolf Eichmann's Christmas tree, he said: ''I'm sorry''. But I want to leave this house. You shrink here. I'm no memory. I'm still in Budapest. I am Laszlo Szamosi and now I'm walking out. Fit as a fiddle! Josef... Where is Raoul? Where is Raoul? Raoul! - It's a nice kid, isn't it? - Sure, like its parents. Having a child in these times, it must be a little one... In our family we decided in 1938 that they should all be small. Raoul! Mazel tov. Good evening, Raoul. I just came to fetch a suitcase. They are from the Swiss consulate. Excuse us for speaking Swedish. There's one way out left. Tomorrow it might be too late. Yes, I know. We have a plane and it's taking off in 2 hours. They are going with it. You should be on the plane, too. Your work has been immense, but now it's over. Soon the war will be over in Budapest. You're going home. We're all going home. You'll be hailed like a hero. You have a reputation... and all papers want an interview. And then, what? I'm not asking you. It's an order. I?d avoid that word. You're going home. They've decided this together in Stockholm and Washington. - So they held a meeting? - About your safety. - You're tired, Raoul. - Like the murderers, Mr. Ambassador. Don't call me ''Mr. Ambassador''. You're standing there like one. So, me and Eichmann were to flee from Budapest on the same day? It's an order. But I'm not a real diplomat. I only use you. I'm in no organization, and I'm not something you hold meetings about. I am not somebody's employee. I am my own. I can be well-mannered if I have to. But I no longer obey to anyone. Christmas... ''Holy Night...'' I've come to tell you that Eichmann has left. Maybe you're interested in knowing what's happening in the world. Another night, and then he won't stand it any longer. Maria... Maria! I have clothes for you! Soon it will all be over! Only a few more days! Maria... Then it will be over for good. I wanted him to shoot me. But it didn't work out. He sat on a bucket, taking a shit. Then I didn't want it any more. I've dressed like you said. You can't have the stockings like that. Maybe your children are still alive, Maria? No, they are not. They were shot to death both of them in this room. I didn't want to tell you before. I will never leave this house. And I will never hide again. - He is insane. - Let him walk. He'll be shot down at the next corner. Do you know what I think? I think you're going to kill yourself. Here. You're going to shoot yourself. In a few minutes all people on this platform will be dead. Come up! Come up! - Are you armed? - No. You can't kill some, and then let the others walk away. Then you could as well have let them all walk away. It concerns everyone. Otherwise it would be a crime. You'll shoot yourself. Just yourself. You needed almost 3 days to understand that. Sit down. Eichmann left in the middle of the night, and he took everyone with him. They left you here in Budapest. It's rather cold. Are you trying to gain time? I have a gun. I have a gun, too. There are no bullets in it. It's not loaded. You obviously work for the security force, but on a special assignment for ''The Sonderkommando''. Maybe as an... Hungarian expert. Have you got a name at all? - Are you called anything? - Stay seated. What's your name? Who am I talking to? What kind of man are you? You know my name. We are not very different. My... name is Moser. Moser Ferenc. You're going to shoot yourself now, Moser Ferenc. You're not going to shoot... anyone else again. Not even me. Only yourself, Ferenc. Only you die. May I step down? You have to shave, Ferenc. Tell everyone here that they can go. You can all go. You can all go! You can all go. You can all go now. Hell, go! Go, go! Now... you can all go. An... An ambulance! An ambulance! Why don't you help me? Call an ambulance! Quick! Come here! An ambulance! Why don't you help me? You'd better beware of me. I'm... I'm afraid that I'm not quite clear in my head. Go live elsewhere. We have houses. I don't want to be rescued. Come and sit here, papa. You feel powerless. It'll be worse. I think you should... I won't ask you. But... ...if I did ask you, would you please... ...kiss me? Officer! Stop! Everyone understands what this means. Stop! I want to know who signed this. Stand still! In the name of the whole civilized world! Stop! Let me go! Don't touch me! I am Raoul Wallenberg, chief for section C at the Swedish Embassy. You dare not kill me in front of your ministers' door. I come unannounced, Mr. Minister of the Interior. You must stop taking children from the children's home in the ghetto. And I want you to leave all those with Swedish protectory passports, and all those staying in the houses of the neutral states, in peace. I have a suggestion. You need food. I have some. You're still standing, Mr. Wallenberg. You still have provisions, when the Germans are short of food. And you are to share that with us, the "Nyilas"-party. If you agree to my terms... It's about many people, far too many outside the ghetto. 35 000. And you dare not touch them! We understand each other. Don't exaggerate about ''understanding each other''. I want a Swedish passport... if the Russians come too early. Yes or no? Yes. We play the same game with the same rules. I want to prevent murder. That's all. Other people die, we don't. I agree to your terms. But it won't prevent murder. The ghetto will be exterminated. I myself will see to that. Write down everything about the amounts, delivery times and so on. We need you. Your presence in Budapest calm the conscience of the rest of the world. I have understood that. You won't get through with it. All people, you think you can save, will at last be exterminated. I'll manage. You'll fall by yourself.., if nobody shoots you before. You've misunderstood the reality.., Mr. Wallenberg. This house is protected by the Swedish Embassy! You won't get the money until they're all out in the street. We want everything you've got, just everything. Or else... - 15 000. - Everything! - 20. - 40! Stop! That's enough! You can't imagine how much that idiot pays for these Jewish swine. Stop! Don't you see? 40. 27. Thanks, Wallenberg. You're welcome. Get up. All those still alive must get up. Raoul! Raoul Wallenberg! You will get us all killed. No one at the Embassy can go, if you stay. - The Foreign Minister has a message. - What does he want? He wants you... to go home. A situation will arise with no diplomatic rules. It has already arisen. Even more a reason for you to go! You'll cause trouble, Raoul Wallenberg! Whether it's the Hungarians, the Russians or the Germans who kill you, you'll be trouble! A diplomatic encumbrance that nobody wants. I don't understand a word. Langfelder! I appeal to your intelligence, to your reason and to your capability. I'm neither reasonable, intelligent nor capable.. any more! Who is capable? We or the murderers? Who is intelligent? We or them? Why don't you appeal to my... I'd like to kill someone. Maria is not well. She doesn't feel that she's alive. She won't manage, Raoul. Soon you'll be able to go cycling, Eva. It'll be fun, right? Mr. Wallenberg... You're trying to shorten time. Don't! For us it's so brief. They will... They will exterminate the ghetto. My shirt is torn. No one likes the victims. A victim is no real human being. Isn't that so, Mr. Wallenberg? God didn't create us... Mr. Wallenberg. We made him... Created... That's why human beings are... holy. Only because of that. We give him life... or we kill him. Do you understand? But I don't understand. I only understand that everybody hates the victims. Me too. But you... don't believe in God.., Wallenberg? I used to, papa... before I learnt how terrible a human being can be. Everything is now totally meaningless, Raoul. - Try once again. - This ghetto is doomed. We have used all our contacts within the German general staff. General Schmidthuber will never meet you. He said so himself. Do you know that 273 people were fetched from one of your houses? Katona Josef, 21. An hour ago. - Let's take your car. - I haven't got a car. Then we'll run. Why aren't you coming? Don't you get it? They killed them. Killed... killed... killed... They all died, every single one. I had money, a lot of money. I sold my house. I hid the money in a children's home with 35 children. They were ill. They fetched them an hour ago. They really try to... 273 people! - What are you talking about? - Aren't you cold? What? They murdered them. They murdered them. - Come! - I have never... What are you talking about? Come! Come, let's run. Szamosi, come! - They killed them! - Come on! Szamosi! Come on! Lazy was dead! Ishtvan was dead! Janos was dead! Bring back the women behind the truck. Don't you recognize me? Ferri Krausz. Your brother was in my class. I was in III-B. Wait! One minute... I'm Raoul Wallenberg... from the Swedish Embassy. And I'm the apostle Johannes... I'm Raoul Wallenberg. I'm Sweden. Who is at command here? Who is at command here? Everybody is at command here! Who is in charge!? Who is at command here!? Some time between 11 and 12 the alarm will go off. It's now. I'm not coming with you. I didn't ask you to. I'm no good when I'm scared. I'll be of no help to you. I don't think you should do it. What else can I do? You refused to see me, general Schmidthuber. - I'm Raoul Wallenberg. - I can have you killed. Get out! I wouldn't have come, herr general, if I hadn't something important to say. How did you get here? Do you invite me to your shelter? Are you crazy? It's the HQ. I don't care what it is. - What did you want to say? - Stand still. - Hell, there's a bomb alarm! - Stand still, herr general!!! There's something funny about this. Very funny. 65 000 people are threatened to die, and here we are, the two of us. The usual diplomatic manner is no more, as I can see. Most things are no more to us. If the ghetto is exterminated, you'll be shot as a murderer, General Schmidthuber. We have complete documentation that you alone is responsible. Have you realized that? Only you can stop it. This documentation was also sent to Washington... five hours ago. Please, hold the umbrella so that I don't get rain in my eyes. You'll be shot as a murderer, general Schmidthuber, not as a soldier. Won't the Minister of the Interior Vajna, stop that? No. On the contrary! Can you please accompany me, herr general... so that the guards let me out. You are a desperate man, Wallenberg. That's a normal condition when it's all over. How are you feeling, my general? Not too bad. I'm happy to hear that. Give my regards to your wife Mathilde and your daughters Jenny and Clara... and to your son Klaus Heinrich, whose call-up papers so miraculously disappeared. You're well informed, Mr. Wallenberg. We wrote to your family today, and to your officers. We explained the choice you've made, so that they can understand. 65 000 people are in the ghetto right now, - we wrote, completely defenceless. A very friendly letter. Are you tired? Guard! Soldiers! Guards! The general wants a word with you. Has it stopped raining, Maria? He sleeps at other places too, so that no one knows where he is. Lilith... I see Lilith. Go away! You ought to thank us, fucking whore. We gave you food, too. You can go wherever you want. Anywhere. The whole town is yours. Go now... You can't stay here in front of the door. Get lost! Move it, for Christ's sake! Get lost! Stop! Move it! Faster! Hurry up! Get lost, for Christ's sake! Did you see that? Bella! Do you know that Maria killed a man? You should absolutely not leave. Don't go down there again. You must have died 4 or 5 times and yet you're standing there. And you at least 20 times! And yet you're standing there. Maria... The whole idea is mad. And it's extremely dangerous. One kind of madness is the one and only possibility. Ask him to let go. Our plan for Hungary comes 100 years too early, or 1000... I know what I am doing. Almost... Don't talk as if you wanted to understand the world. The Russians have other plans. He'll never come back. No one will help him. Ask him to stay. I think you should go. Don't cut your hair any more. Let it grow. I'll be back in 10 days. For the first time, at least I don't feel worse than other people. The same day, January 17, 1945, he was brought as a prisoner to Moscow. He was never released. ? Subtitles OCR, spelling and synchronisation made by LEONID55, Jan 2009.
