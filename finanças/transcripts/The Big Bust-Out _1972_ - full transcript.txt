(upbeat jazz music) (women chattering) (laughing) - How many times have I told you you're not allowed to talk? - [Woman] Why don't you go get yourself laid? (slapping) - Shut your trap or I'll put you in the hole. - Shove it, you cow! - Come on, back in your cells! - The picnic's over. - Move it, you! - In you go! - Come on, come on! - Move along, move along! (percussion music) - Well, Gail? ♪ Greensleeves are my delight ♪ (humming) Night, beautiful! - [Guard] Go to sleep. - If she tries to hit me again, I swear I'll kill the old cow. - If you go and do that, you'll just end up in jail for good. - Listen to me, all of you. We've got to come to some kind of agreement, or we're going to end up like animals. Inga? (sighing) A thousand miles away. Inga, do you agree? - Agree with what? - Oh, what's the matter, Inga? Are you hypnotized by the clouds? Why do you stare at them all the time? - Oh, I don't know. I guess because I want to. - I bet she dreams the same dreams I do, that we're never gonna get out of here. - It's Gail with the old bag. - Shh, be quiet. (foreboding music) (moaning) (ominous organ music) - You're going to enjoy this, Gail. (yelping) - Let go of me! (giggling) (whip cracking) (wailing) - Come on, get in. Go over there. There. - [Woman] A year in the hole and you'll be like her. - Good morning. - Good morning, Sister. Open it. (dog barking) (door knocking) - Come in. - Good morning, Mr. Maugh. - [Maugh] Good morning, Sister Maria. What can I do for you? - I'd like a favor. Thank you. Unfortunately, although I've tried my best, I haven't achieved much. - That I can understand. Our guests here are not exactly saints. - I wouldn't try to say they are. - [Maugh] Let their records speak for themselves. Carmen Rodriguez, Spanish, killed her lover out of jealousy, 20 years. Gail Hoffman, Swiss, receiving three years. Held on suspicion many times, and a tough one. Inga Mareska, Polish, passing bad checks. First offense, she'll be out soon. Claire King, US passport. Interpol got her on a forgery charge. She's in for seven. Lolita Anderson, English, Claire's girlfriend. Sneak thief, second offense, three years. Liane Leclair, five years for pushing all types of drugs. Kris Campbell, pickpocket, one year. (ominous music) - We found the remains of a joint in this cell. You, you and you get undressed. The rest of you, back to your cells. - Get undressed, come on, hurry. Come on. - See what's in here. - You can see alright without touching me. - Turn around, now bend over! I shan't say it again. Down, that's it. I want to see what you're hiding. (woman squealing) - Is it really necessary to be so vulgar in our methods? - Listen here, Sister Maria, this is not your affair. They're criminals, these girls, and should be treated as such. - These girls are human beings like you and me. - We'll deal with this another time. Have them get dressed. - You shouldn't have to put up with that, I'm sorry. - Oh that's nothing, she was sweet compared to other times. - Listen girls, I have a surprise for you. I think you'll like it. From tomorrow you'll be coming to work at our convent. (girls shouting) Don't thank me, you must thank our Lord. - Goodbye, Sergeant. - Goodbye, Sister. - Sister Maria, you must remember that the responsibility in taking care of these poor lost souls is entirely yours. - [Maria] Yes. - I hope you realize the chance you're getting. You are being given the perfect opportunity to repent, to redeem your souls in the eyes of God, to replenish your souls with the eternal spirit. I trust you will behave fittingly as long as you're behind these walls. - Sure will. Next you'll have us singing "Ave Maria." - May God aid you in your work. (water splashing) (upbeat music) - Can't you be more careful, you stupid ass? - Oh shut up, water is especially good for you. - Drop dead, you blonde bitch. - Hey, don't be jealous, sweet thief, we can't all smell good. - You whore, always turned on by a pair of pants! - Don't touch me! (women shouting) - What are you doing, girls? Stop it at once. Now what's going on? What happened? - Oh nothing, Claire wants to go to the toilet, can she? - Of course, anybody else? - Yes, me. - Alright, follow me. - Hey. Making you horny, is it? - What do you want? - To screw you, what else? Well, go ahead, take me. You're just what I need. (slapping) I guessed you have no balls. - Don't ever say that again, you filthy whore, or I kill you. (kicking) (moaning) - [Woman] Well, now we got both of 'em. - Aw, but he was nice. - Come on, out here. - Oh dear, things really happened while we were away. - What have you done? Are you mad? - They're still alive. - But the guns, leave them down at once. - Are you kidding? We need them. - I hope you'll forgive us, Sister Maria, but we're all leaving. - [Maria] But. - Alright, be good and nothing will happen to you. - All of you stand up and line up against the wall. - What is the meaning of this terrible outrage? - We want you to undress. - Hey you, old pal, what you looking at me like that for? Think I'm a martian? Get off there. (laughing) All right, now come on, up you get against that wall. - Come on, come on, up against the wall. - And we haven't got all day. - Alright, go and find something that fits you, hurry. - Hey you, you're just my size, take it off. - Mother Superior! - And you'll do just nicely for me. Come on, undress. - Not one of you are to comply, sisters. - Is that right? They've got about 20 seconds to get their clothes off and if they don't, believe me, you'll all- (gun shooting) (laughing) (tense music) - May we pass, Sister Maria? - I can't leave you. You understand, don't you? - That means you're coming with us? - [Maria] Yes. - But we're ready to do anything and I mean anything. We're not going back to jail, we'd rather die first. - Have you forgotten? I've made myself responsible for you. I have to come with you. - Take her along if she's so insistent. - All right, come on, let's go. - [Woman] After you, Sister. (chattering) - Hello? - Hello Nadia, this is Lee. - Lee, but I thought you were, aren't you still? - Right now we need help. - Yes, of course, well sure. - I tell you I'm getting awfully nervous sitting here. - You know it might be better for us to split up now. - No, not yet. Together we have more hope of defending ourselves. - All right, Nadia, you can bring 'em over here. - Yes, it's alright, see you. - Everything is good, let's go. - Are you sure we can trust these characters? - 100%, we are like this, they'll help us. (soft music) (women giggling) Throw it to me! (indistinct chatter) - And then we're stuck in the mini-bus. - Listen, how come you brought a nun along with you, eh? - Well she decided she better stick around and save our souls personally. - She's crazier than I am. - Hey Sister, join us! Come on! - Well, I see you like the merchandise. - Can you guarantee it? - Have I ever offered you anything, El Kadir, that wasn't genuine? - No. Just as long as my men are happy. I presume this includes delivery as well. - Mm-hmm. If you're not satisfied, you'll get it back. Alright girls, everybody out of the pool, fun's over. - No. No. - It was a trap and it was that bitch Liane who got us in here. (women shouting) - Please! - We ought to kill her! Claire, don't let her get away! - What are you doing, girls? Are you all crazy? Stop it girls, you hear me? Stop! Clair, Gail, Inga, Lisa, now stop it! - [Bob] All of you, out! - What's wrong? What are you doing here? - Watching the floor show, baby. And improving things around here. You're going with 'em. That's what you wanted, isn't it? - Keep your eyes open, huh? - Sure, boss. - Jeff, good to see you. - How you doing, Bob? - Well it steams up and we're ready to go. What are we carrying this time? - Go see for yourself. - Listen Bob, I don't wanna get myself involved in a slave market. - Oh, you don't want me to remind you of your debts, do you? - The hell with my debts, I won't run white slaves. - Listen Jeff, let's say after this trip we'll be even. - Uh-uh, you want a word of advice, you and that gang of yours can leave. Like right now. So that's it, huh? You sure there's enough of you? (punching) (tense music) (gun shooting) - Hey, hey! Stop! (siren wailing) - No! (car exploding) (fire crackling) - Hey, are you Jeff? - Yeah. - We heard what you said to Bob. Thank you. - Excuse me. Thanks. Are you a real nun? - Yes. I hope you don't mind. - Good Lord, no, I was just wondering how you got into this rather interesting company. - Where are we? - Here. And we must make it over these mountains or head towards the coast down here. - I like the sea. - Well since Jeff knows how to handle a boat, we could steal one. - Uh-uh, we'd never make it. There are too many police blocks on the coast road. It's too risky. I think the best way is to go over the mountains. - In these rags, we'll freeze our butts off. You know what it's like at night, cold as an iceberg, you'll see. - And what about this, how much? - Three dollars, you can have the lot for 50. - And this? - With ammunition, 30 dollars. - It's not fair, they sit like poshers in front and we sit back here collecting bruised butts. - She's right, how come darling Inga always sits up front? Is she any better than any of us? - She's got hot pants for Jeff. - Lolita is jealous. - Well what of it? What's she got that we haven't got? We could steal him, take it in turn, couldn't we? - She's already making the guy, so we're out. - The way you broads drool over a man is really disgusting. - There it is, the end of the line. - What do we do now? - Get out. - Hey Jeff, what's going on? - It's as far as we can go with the truck. We'll camp here for the night and start the climb in the morning. Okay, everybody out. - [Reporter] There is still no trace of the seven women prisoners who escaped while on a work detail at a convent in the capital. They are thought to be holding a nun as a hostage. Police are also searching for the captain of the cargo ship Sudden Star who is -- - The police think you kidnapped me. - We heard it too, so what? - I'm cold, I'm gonna get a blanket. - [Jeff] You've all gotta get to sleep now, it's gonna be a hard day tomorrow. - A hard day tomorrow is right. I don't like the look of those mountains at all. - Get as much rest as you can. We've got a lot of walking to do. - [Woman] How far do you think it is going to be, Jeff? - Who cares how far it is, we have to get there, no? - [Woman] You don't have a nice word to say about anything. - [Jeff] Hey, how about you girls knocking it off, huh? We gotta get some sleep. - [Woman] That's right, you heard him, let's go to sleep. (gun shooting) - Lolita, you stupid bitch, what are you trying to do, kill us? - Give that here. - I didn't realize it was loaded or I wouldn't have touched it. - Alright, in case it's necessary, who knows how to use this thing? - I do. - I do too. - Good, let's hope we don't need it though. Hey Lolita, are you crazy? Get down all of you! (grenade exploding) You are crazy! - You know we ought to kill that bitch. - But I didn't think -- - No. Now don't touch anything else. - Good morning. - Good morning, Colonel. - A pleasure to see you. - Wanna join us in the pool? - Thank you but I can't, I'm on duty. Since you called me, we must have some business to discuss. - That's right. I'm missing certain merchandise in the form of eight girls who are somewhere in your territory. - Ah, that could be rather complicated. - Oh? Why should it be complicated, Colonel? I just want my merchandise returned in reasonable condition. - You know, Mr. Shaw, there is very bad blood here between the army and the police. That is the complication. - You're a clever man and 1,000 dollars should get rid of any complication. - Yes, and leave me nothing. - Alright, 2,000 dollars. - You have a deal, Mr. Shaw, and I'll be careful of your merchandise. - Mm-hmm. - Come on girls, keep going. (tense music) What are you doing? God, get up, move! - Here, I'll take it for a while. - Thanks. (groaning) - Here Lolita. - Don't let her guzzle it all down. Who knows when we'll find some more. - She can have my ration. - Well what are you going to do when it's all gone? - God will help me. - Come on, we've got to keep moving. - There should be a village around here somewhere where we can get something to eat if we're lucky. - If we're still alive, you mean. - I think I'm going mad. I hear what sounds like a river. - I can hear it too, where's it coming from? (water flowing) - Come on, it's down here. (cheering) (light music) - [Woman] Hey Jeff! (screaming) (tense music) (punching) (evil laughing) (women shouting) - No, no! - The chosen ones are protected by the Lord, especially while they're asleep. - Did I sleep? - Yeah, and you missed all the fun of life. - Why? What has happened? - It was nice, clean fun. Swimming and the usual. - You are never getting out of my sight again, I swear it. - Well? - No, nothing. It would take forever to find her in these hills. - We must find her. - God almighty, what a place! During the day we fry and during the night we freeze. Any sign of poor Nadia? - No, and it's stupid to go on looking. Wherever she is, she's dead by now. - All day we've been circling the area searching. If she were around here we'd have found her. - We'll keep looking for her. Despite what anyone may say, we all want her back. (ominous music) - Hey, will you look at that. Isn't that something? - Incredible. I wonder who lived here. - [Maria] Isolated groups of Christians used it as a refuge a long time ago. It's said that Davidson Paul lived here for a while. (gun shooting) - That wasn't bad. But listen, hold it tighter, closer to your body like this. (grunting) - The important thing is who's faster. Turn the knife around, point up. Now grip it like this, that's it. - Won't you ever learn, you dumb broad? - Don't call me a dumb broad again, I mean it. - You're learning fast, you dumb broad. (gong ringing) - Hey, you realize we are standing on golden territory? - Yes, but it's costing me a lot of money. - I don't care for the way you made me come here, you know. - I have a contract with you and I want it fulfilled. - You're gonna get 'em. - Yes, the question is when? - Don't worry about it. We know they're somewhere in this area. They'll soon find their way into our net. It's just a question of time before we pick them up. - I'll give you three days. Either the girls or the money. - Well, this is where the tracks lead. But it looks pretty deserted. They must've exhausted themselves with us. I bet they're down there asleep recovering from all that exertion. - Still no sign of Nadia. - I think we should go into the village and have a look. - Fair enough, you all stay up here. - No, I will go. If something should happen to you who would look after the girls. - Alright, but be careful. Only go as far as the fountain. If anyone's there, ask them for something to eat. - What happens if they take her prisoner? - Maybe that'll tell us where Nadia is. Anyway, we can see every move from here. Don't worry, we'd get you out again, Sister. - I'm not afraid. - Good luck. - You know she has a lot more guts than I thought. (soft organ music) - I think you're out of your mind to send her by herself. - Don't worry, we'll follow her in a few minutes. (chickens clucking) (gasping) (grunting) - Nadia! Oh my God, dear child, what did they do to you? - Don't stay, Sister, go away. (whip cracking) - Stop it! Stop it, you little thief! No, leave her alone. (grunting) (rock smacking) Dear God, what have I done? (ominous music) (guns shooting) - Go on, go and help her! - Sister Maria, we must get away from here at once! Come on, we'll help. - Nadia's in there. - In here? Come on, hurry, go and get her. - Oh, Santa Maria! How horrible. - Let's get her down, hurry! - [Woman] Get move on or else we'll all end up like that. - Hurry up, can't you? (guns shooting) - She can't walk, we have to carry her. - Die! (shouting) - Let's get the hell out of here. The whole place is crawling with the bastards. - Hey listen, I found another way out! - Hey, they're coming. - Let's go, come on! - Up you go. (door banging) (grenade exploding) Come on. - This way, come on, hurry, hurry! - Look, horses! - Come on, let's get a move on! The faster we go, the safer we'll be. - Wait, wait. - Hey, what's the matter, Lolita? - Oh, it's my ass, I can't ride. Feels like its been torn to bloody shreds. - The way she's wailing she sounds worse than a cat in heat. - Please don't be so mean to her, Inga. - Can she go with you, Nadia? - Sure she can, come on. Sister Maria, I'm afraid of the dark. - It will not be dark. God is with you, my child. There's nothing to be afraid of. - They hanged them because it says they stole. - Well, that evens the score. - It means police country, so beware. - Let's go. (mouth clicking) (soft music) - Hello, Mr. Robinson. No, no, leave your gun where it is. Are all of these women your property, Mr. Robinson? - Yeah, six of them, why? - Well they're certainly nice to look at. But it must be quite a job protecting them. - No, not really. Tell you the truth, they're protecting me. - They protect you? Well we'll take on that job now. Women are made for better things. - You're right, why don't you go and have some fun with them? - Achmed, come down here and choose a woman. - Let's have a look at you. (laughing) Not bad at all. - You know what, you stink. Go wash! (laughing) - You believe it now? - Kill 'em all. (guns shooting) - Alright Colonel, you still want my girls? - What do we do with our prisoner? You think we should kill him now? - No, don't! No, please, don't shoot. No, no, don't! - I don't know if I'm shivering 'cause I'm cold or if I've got the shakes 'cause we're so near the border. - It's the cold, Lolita. - It's snowing out there, it just started. - We were lucky to find this place. Jeff, how high are we? - Well I'm only guessing, but I'd say about 8,000. - At this rate we're just going to end up dead. We're all going to be frozen. - Let her sleep, Lolita. Let us pray for her. My dear God, please help us, your poor children, hardship and danger, and deliver us from our enemies. (whispering) Have mercy on us and forgive us our sins. - See that castle? The border is just beyond it, girls. - Are we going to push across the border now? - No, in the morning. We'll spend the night in the castle. We could use the rest. (dramatic music) (evil laughing) - Throw down your gun, Jeff. (gun shooting) Been expecting you, Jeffrey. It wasn't very nice of you to run away like that. (punching) (grunting) - No! That's enough! You dirty beast, leave him alone! (chuckling) - She really has balls. - You guiltless creatures. The Lord will punish you for what you are doing. You murderers! (laughing) (Maria shouting) - Well old friend, I've kept my part of the bargain. See you around. - I paid for eight girls, there's only five here. - Well the nun is worth double, wouldn't you say? She'll bring you 21 years good luck. And to make up the rest, I'll give you muscles, jack of all trades. - Mm, alright. Muhad, you have your instructions, take them away. - Out of here, all of you. And you, get going! - Well, how do you like this place? It looks like Sahara. - (speaker muffled) King's road. - Pretty expensive stuff though. - All of you must change. You must make yourselves beautiful for your master, El Kadir, understand? - Sure we do. (chattering) - And you, what does it matter? Go and get changed like the others. - No, I will not. - You will do as I tell you or I will- - Leave her alone! - No, you misunderstood! I was joking. Girls, girls, she's alright, I didn't touch her. You know how it is, I was following orders. I'm just a poor, ignorant peasant, you know how it is. Goodbye. - The greasy pig. - Yeah. - Claire, I'm worried about Sister Maria. - There's nothing we can do. - Do you think she knows what they're going to do to her? - No. I don't think she has the least idea. - Don't you think we ought to tell her? - She's gonna find out soon enough. (evil laughing) - Get to him later. - Alright, come on, hurry. Put that down there, quick. - Hey Bob. - Yeah, what's that? - I've got a surprise for you. Follow me and I'll show you. (people chattering) (Arabian music) (clapping) Take a look in there. Well, that would keep us for a few weeks, wouldn't it? - In here. (cheering) I brought the girls. - This way, my dear. Come, sit up here. (speaker voice muffled) Come here, you. I want you all to enjoy yourselves. Drink! Drink and be merry! Hey! You want some of this? - Yes, me. - Try a bite. You? - Have you any idea what's going to happen now? - Sure, haven't you? The soldiers are gonna have their choice of us. There's about 60 here so that means it's gonna be a busy night and believe me I'd like to rot. - Beautiful, you want a real man tonight? - You want to make a little fun, huh? (evil laughing) - [Woman] Get away, you ape. - Get off, can't you leave her alone? - Are you enjoying yourself? (squealing) She's got legs! (speaker drowned out by music) (spitting) - Who are you, dirty little bitch? (speaker voice muffled) (gun shooting) (evil laughing) What are you trying to do, kill us? - [Man] I was just saying hello! - I ought to hang you for that! - Alright now, bring it up front and be careful. Don't pull the trigger by accident. Go on, put it down there. Look man. Well, how are you, my old friend? I brought you a beautiful present. Just look at that, will you. Don't touch. Well, you like? Dat-dat-dat-dat-dat-dat-dat! - Come back here. Muhad, put that thing up on the balcony at once. - How did you get a hold of so many beautiful girls? I'm most impressed, they are lovely. - They are. - Is there one for me? One of these beautiful girls, huh? - For the machine gun, you can take one girl. - But I can pick the one I like? - Mm-hmm. - Hey, hey, I like the one sitting over there. - Leave her alone! - You don't know what you're missing. You people are always preaching love. You ought to practice what you preach or else its hypocrisy, isn't that right? Come on, I just want a little love, that's all. (percussion music) (organ music) That's it, huh? You're just going to pretend indifference, huh? Well listen, you better cooperate a little sister. You won't find a better lover. (guns shooting) - [Bob] Hey you, wake up. - Don't tell me you're letting me out. - Well yes, but first I wanna know if you'll help us. - Are you making me a partner, is that your idea? - No, not exactly. I was thinking of giving you your freedom. If you'll help us out a bit. - And if I refuse, what then? - The girls need their man, Jeffrey. What about your noble instincts? They're having a pretty rough time of it in there. - All right. - Beware, Jeff, no tricks, huh? - Here, take a swig of this. - There's a lookout up in the tower. Knock 'em off, will you, Johnny? - I warned you, Sister, I'm going to carve you up in little bitty pieces like this. - Oh please, dear God, help me to endure this. - [Man] Nobody's going to help you. (choking) - Johnny, they'll be sitting ducks from up here with this but wait till I've got the girls out, okay? - Gotcha. (gun shooting) - Johnny. - What's happened to the others? Jeff, Sister Maria's in danger! She's over there somewhere. - It is the last time I'm going to ask you! (gun shooting) Come, you wish to die? You want me to slice your throat? - Here's Claire. - Carmen's dead. - [Woman] Lolita, Lolita! - Claire, come on, she's dead. There's nothing you can do for her. - Leave me with her. No! - Let's get out of here. - That way. - Inga! - He's gone crazy, Jeff, he's trying to kill everyone. - Sister Maria! - Jeff. I've made so many mistakes in my life. - Just rest. - Oh God, forgive me for all the terrible sins. (religious choral music) - She wanted so badly to be with us. - She's one lady I'll never forget. - Let's go. (upbeat music)
