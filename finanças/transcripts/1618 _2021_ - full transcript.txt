Do you remember that group of New Christians who asked the King for permission to go on a pilgrimage to Rome? Yes. What of them? They fled. They fled to Antwerp to then register at the synagogues. They were related to Antonio Alvares. There he is. Antonio! There are 30 boxes ready to go to Flanders. They will leave tonight. -Take care of that for me, please. -I will, don't worry. May Adonai help you. The Jews are the only ones I can talk to about new things. Not the Christians, they live in the past. But the ostentation of their wealth vexes me. I’ve never heard Antonio and Frederico say they are rich. -They are discreet. -Oh, really? Look, look at them everywhere, full of themselves. If we do not see hungry Jews, it's because they have created a network of solidarity. And do we see that among Christians? Antonio Alvares and Frederico Mocatta! Behold the richest men in the city! He, who works from morning till night, trying to please suppliers and customers, is a rich man? Or in poorly equipped boats, in the heat and cold, hoping to accumulate some wealth to then be the target of thieves' greed? The chicken or the egg? Who was born first, Father? Another good question, Frederica! God created the species "chicken" and then many, many, many chickens at the same time. What about Jews? How many did he create? Why do you ask? My parents argue. Father says Jews are bad, mother says Jews are good. Your mother is a New Christian. She is actually Jewish. But, you know, Jews are exactly the same as Christians, there are good ones and bad ones. And you, Father, are you Jewish? Christ was Jewish. I serve Christ. Ms. Ana Mocatta, accept my deepest respects. Ana! -This is for you! -Oh! Thank you! Ana, you are the most beautiful Jewish girl in Porto! Please, Lady Adelaide, don't use that word, we could have problems. We are "New Christians." Antonio has told your father he wants you to marry our son, but you don't want him. Oh, Ana, he would provide you with so much wealth! My father is also rich! You court my daughter, you want her as daughter-in-law? You have good taste. I know who Ana likes. Only Daniel Dias interests her. Look, look! There he is, taking orders from the Corregedor. He doesn't want you, Ana. He's only interested in the laws of the Kingdom and the wishes of the Corregedor. He abandoned his people, he abandoned us. "I am a product of the creation that never ceases. I was immersed in the first bubbling of life in the primitive seas of the earth. And today… …today I can speak to you!" "At the confluence of said hermeneutics, we decided that you will no longer be exhorted to correction, but that you must now pay the punishment that is imposed." I will be the purest of men, sir, if you give me one more chance! This pain is unpleasant and persistent, Dr. Nicolau! What might be the cause? Constant repetition of the same movement can lead to inflammation. Rest will heal this malaise. Good morning, Mayor. I have the official letter sent by the Corregedor. Come in, Fernandes. Put it on my table. I feel you are worried. I am inclined to think that… …the Holy Office will be visiting this city. What makes you say that, Mayor? I know they are visiting Aveiro, and it is near, it is very near from here. Mr. Visitator Sebastião Noronha, a message from the Cardinal. There are certain movements within the church that have put me on alert. And the target are the Jews. Judaism practiced in secret has disappeared! It would be impossible to keep a hypocritical behavior for so many generations! But there are whispers that the Holy Office looks with suspicion at several illustrious people in this city. And one of them is your merchant friend, Antonio Alvares. What nonsense! Antonio does not practice Judaizing heresies. I am New Christian and I assure you. You, Dr. Nicolau, are living proof that the New Christians remain aware and proud of their Jewish origin! And is there anyone in this city who has not descended from New Christians? Thanks to money and marriage and the change of name and place, New Christians have mixed with the entire population. So, if anyone wants to imprison all New Christians in this city, this city will be almost deserted. Here, it is yours! My son had two and I told him, "I am going to give it to the first children I find." Who are you, stranger? I am one of you, I am a Jew. I came from Lisbon, my name is Joel, actually, Yoel. And what is your name? I am José. Ah… …that is your Christian name. No, the name they call you at home. Your Jewish name. I am Jacob. It was taken from one of our patriarchs. And what is yours? Who is there? Who is there? Nobody! I am nobody until you help your people! I serve Jews and non-Jews, I serve all the residents of this city. I serve the law! Being on the side of the law doesn't mean being on the side of justice. Your mother would've loved to see how beautiful you've become. Don't make me cry, father. I miss her so much! I need you to get married, Ana. I am getting old. "For the ignorant, old age is winter. For the learned, it is the harvest." Is not that how the proverb goes? This town has never been safe for us. At any moment we can be arrested by the Holy Office. Rumors. They’re just that. People have always liked to have a reason to talk. They like to sow fear. Isn't it better to leave? Leave to Amsterdam. And how proud I would be if you got married there! I don't want the Netherlands, father. I am in love with here. Think of yourself, daughter. You are slave to an impossible love. A love that can get us killed. Ana! Ana! I have been to Porto twice, Visitator. One walks on the streets and who does one find? Rodrigues, Silvas, Pereiras, they use the Suevi and Visigoth names. What we want is to know their Hebrew names. Even the monks end up leaving the monasteries to take the road to Morocco, Tunisia, Turkey, and even Flanders to be circumcised. A blood cleansing would amount to depopulating the city. That threat is indisputable. And even tragic, when you talk about a city like Porto. So tells us John, the Apostle, "If Christ sets you free, you will be free indeed." And that was why. More than a century ago, when the Jews were forced to convert to Catholicism, at first they tried to resist, they wanted to remain as a private community. Consorting among themselves, remembering Moses, fighting in their own way against religiocide. But let us remember that little by little, Jesus Christ convinced the most hardened hearts. And after that, all the ancient Jews became good Christians! I tell you, brothers, I get goose bumps when I see all these people every day in church, who then… …live hating the New Christians. And it is slanderous! And slander is a grave sin that Jesus Christ does not want! Let us pray to the Lord! I worship neither wood nor stone, Adonai is my ship. I worship neither wood nor stone, Adonai is my ship. The bed is cold, Corregedor. I expected as much. They ran away at night. They must be miles away by now. Why did they run away? They were noblemen, they had nothing to fear. They ran away in fear of the Holy Office. And how did they manage to become noblemen? Many Jewish girls marry noble Christians men. The children are, therefore, noble and Jewish. Noble Jews? They fled? That is what I heard, Antonio. Our brothers are fleeing. They left their homes this evening. They took everything. It's said they took a boat to Amsterdam. Which families? The Rodrigues, the Espinozas, and the Gansos. Impossible, they would have told us. -Why didn't they? -I don't know. It's a mystery, but this scares me. It scares you? It doesn't seem so. Your joke in the church is dangerous! It is unworthy of Christians and offensive to the authorities of this city who treat us so well! -Antonio, I'd like to talk to you. -Of course, Dr. Nicolau. There are many uncertainties in this city, many rumors. But as a person who holds you in high esteem, I want to warn you that your movements and your life are being watched. Watched? But why? These days, even our shadows are suspicious. Be careful. I foresee accusations! Cells! Interrogations! Public sentencing! Oh! So many afflictions! I have a feeling that something is about to happen in this city. Do you fear accusations from the Christians? I fear accusations from the Jews. We also have our scum, our riff-raff. What are you saying? The temple in Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans because they could no longer stand the envy and slander among the Jews themselves! And the Holy Office knows a lot about Judaism. They know about circumcision, observing Sabbath, the beheading and prohibition of eating certain animals. So much rigor! Adelaide, the New Christians cooperate with the civil and ecclesiastical authorities! And what if we went to Flanders? We have our savings there. Many depend on our charity, we cannot leave them. And what if they're the ones who leave us? Have you thought about that, Antonio? Have you thought about your family? -Adelaide. -You know our son is coming back next month from Castile. Then… …I want to leave. What are you saying, are you sure? Be careful, Antonio. There are spies everywhere. Adelaide, I need to talk to you, immediately. Calm down, Antonio, calm down. Someone may be watching us. Adelaide. A Visitation has arrived to Porto. Warn the maids and warn the children. Filipe, let our brothers know. Where are you going? I need to see what is going on. Please, go home. Do you know who the Visitator is? It seems his name is Sebastião Noronha. He is an expert in the canons of the Church. People of Porto! Bring me your heretics. The punishment of major excommunication will fall on all those who know of cases of heresy and do not report them. Judaism, Lutheranism, the belief in reincarnation of the soul, sorcery, pacts with the Devil, all this will come to an end in this city! Heresy! Heresy! Of all the dangers, the greatest is that of Jewish heresies. There are thousands of Jews out there, in all social classes, even after the emigration of many. In the Ottoman Empire, the Portuguese Jews arrived in such great numbers that they founded their own congregations. The scandal reaches such heights that many of them praise their Jewish origin with chivalrous helmets and noble crowns! On our banner… …are inscribed the mottoes, "Mercy and Justice." Mercy to all those who admit their mistake. Justice… …to those who persist in their crime! We are in a gallery of the old synagogue of Monchique, of the 14th century. And what survived was this. What does this epigraph say? It's in Hebrew. And nobody in the city speaks Hebrew. Not even the Jews. They say it praises the Jews of that time because they felt protected by the Chief Rabbi of King D. Fernando. Someone might say, "Why was such house of repute not guarded inside a wall?" Benefactor of his people, the servant of God, he is Rabbi Don Yehudah ben Maner, light of Judah, and in charge of authority. Such was, for so long, the power of the Jews in this city! You Jews will go for nothing, for such bad people you are! You Jews will go for nothing, for such bad people you are! You Jews will go for nothing! For such bad people you are! You will go for nothing! He is insane, don't listen to him. His mistakes have already been paid for in misery and stupidity. Jews! Jews! The punishments that will fall upon you must serve as an example to others. There must be people. There must be squares, squares full of people! Monsignor Sebastião Matos Noronha, welcome to Porto Court of Appeal. It is an honor to have you here. You may sit, please. Mr. Mayor, I have a great respect for the authorities and civil laws. I hope your respect for ecclesiastical laws also run deep. I'll be honest, I believe that this Visitation may be prejudicial to Porto. Does Your Excellency prefer a prosperous economy to a city close to Christ? And why not both? People tell me that fairs no longer take place on Saturday, but on Sunday. Do you prefer the Jewish holy day to the Christian holy day? What you've been told is false. The Holy Office has persecuted almost 500 people born in this city. Don't you think that's enough? There are thousands of people buying and selling, such beautiful human hustle. Behold the descendants of those who once traded in the lands of Judah. Mr. Visitator, a stronger repression will make the diaspora abroad unstoppable, destroying the plans of King D. Manuel and his successors, who have always desired a policy of complete integration of the New Christians into Portuguese society. On every corner there are whispers and pointed fingers. There are accusations! It is dangerous for us, Ana. Why does God makes us go through this, father? -I even doubt that-- -Hold your tongue! Only fools may think they were born from the dust of the universe. The nature is not cruel, daughter, It's just indifferent. I would like to buy this piece, sir. Certainly, dear customer. I swear to God, sir, believe me, I don't know how that host got here. I will not report you. But in return, you will give me all of your possessions. And your daughter. My daughter has nothing to do with this! Here you go. Do not be such a miser. What else have you got, merchant? It's all I have. Do you have no shame? This is a few days' wages. I want 10,000 maravedis! -I don't have any more, sir! -How come? You exploit the people and say you have nothing! I will not accept such accusations from you. You make people poor. You impoverish the city. You wretched thing! Shut your wicked mouth! -God made you mediocre and a thief! -Frederico! You're not even a man! Oh, Jew! You and your daughter will be forgotten in a dark cell. Calm down! They will call you to ask you for things you won't know how to answer for. You'll take part in an auto-da-fé procession! We all know your Jewish origins. It wouldn't look good for you to defend these people. You know, it would be suspicious. He's the culprit! The criminal. It was in his clothes that I found a host! This man put the host in my clothes. These coins are fake! They are not mine! They are not mine! Counterfeit currency incurs death penalty. For what you've done here, despicable man. Forgive me, sir! Forgive me! I'm innocent! No! Not prison! I'm innocent! I'm innocent! I do not envy your work, Bishop Rodrigo da Cunha. It was in Porto that Portugal was born, but it's also from Porto that Portugal is being destroyed. What a terrible omen, Visitator. Lord Jesus Christ. Today, in the synagogues of the East, pray Jews from Porto who lived within the walls of a convent with the surplice of a priest or the hood of a friar. It is unheard of! It happened to a holy priest, who was on pilgrimage to Rome to visit the body of Saint Cecilia, they sent him to the Jewish ghetto as soon as they heard he was Portuguese. The proceedings of the inquisition identify as Jew anyone who says that salvation is not possible through the Catholicism. It seem to me it is not enough of a reason. They told me about Daniel, the guard. Who is he? A very positive case of Christian zeal. Daniel. Daniel Dias. The Corregedor made him the head guard of the city. His parents were Jewish and died when he was still a child. Abandoned, he clung to Christ. And even more to the law. He is strict. Jews, Christians, Lutherans, common criminals, he arrests them all. The call of the Jewish blood and Jewish soul always comes back. And sometimes with even stronger. Be careful, Bishop. Sometimes I have doubts. Which side are we on, Paulo? On the side of the Jews or on the side of the Christians? Look, it's as Daniel says. There are neither Jews nor Christians, there are residents. Father, Father. This Visitation to the city, as a good Christian, I think it isn't fair for the Church to attack the Jews. The Holy Church is a huge legion of men and women. Me too, I am part the Church. Fabiano, I must say that I won't accept you saying that it attacks the Jews. Because I do not persecute them, my masters have never persecuted them, and the priests of Porto do not persecute them. -Do not say it. -I will say it! -You are really stubborn! -I saw it! I saw it with my own eyes. -That is not true. -Yes, it is. Antonio stepped on a host. You should not be led astray by bad instincts, Filomena. Jealousy or wanting to harm others attracts the wrath of God! The main objective of this Visitation is to try to obtain the riches of the Jews. The Holy Office is very poor. No, no. The inquisitors know that, however rich some of us may be, we have already sent all of our wealth to Flanders or Italy. We have little to give them. Well, gentlemen, other duties call me. We will talk soon. Antonio! -Do you know who has just arrived? -Who? Our cousin Dias, from Smyrna, in Turkey. My cousin! Where is he? At my house. Come. Manuel. -Antonio! -Cousin! -How are you, cousin? -Well! You came at a bad time, cousin. We have a Visitation in the city. So that was it. I felt restlessness in people's eyes. But I do not fear the Visitation. I requested permission to visit this city for two days. Today's Porto is an uncertain place. Just being here together can be dangerous. -Dangerous? -Yes. We are cousins! And everyone in this city has cousins in Morocco, Turkey, Palestine, and even Brazil. -Come on, let us have a drink, sit down. -Yes. So… …what do you need from us, Manuel? I need you to leave this city, this country. In the Netherlands, a refuge is being prepared. Oh, cousin, cousin! If it was only about me, I wouldn’t think twice about going, I would leave today. But there are many here who depend on my charity to survive, and all fear the tribulations of travel and the dangers of escaping. Too often we've received news of families that died during the sea crossing. We cannot give in to our fear. It is all much safer today, believe me! So, my brothers, let us draw up a plan. An escape plan. I will have to think about it, Manuel. My wife, Adelaide, wants to go. But we’re waiting the arrival of our son, who is in Castile. What did he go and do in Castile? Await the arrival of the Messiah. In Castile? I told him that such a belief can lead to the appearance of a deceiver, posing as the Messiah. The belief in the Messiah shows that you are still Jews. Are we, Manuel? We don’t know anything about our religion anymore. In the most distant villages, there is a kind of Judaism mixed with Catholicism. Jews in the villages? You've piqued my curiosity. Tell me about this. Yes! They are Marranos, they created their own religion, a religion spoken in Portuguese. We have some here in this town. They eat pork. They keep more to themselves, no possessions. Maria, who serves me, was born in Bragança. Maria! Yes, sir. Please, can you recite your morning prayer? Fear not, he is our brother from Turkey. "Blessed are You, Adonai, Our Lord, King of the simple people, who made heaven and earth, the days, the nights, who made me and raised me according to your will." What-- what is this? What have we done wrong? May we know your name? Manuel Dias. I have permission to be in the Kingdom, without Judaizing. But isn't your name Manuel Rodrigues? Yes, and Uriel Nunes too. Those are your trade names, right? In Turkey they say your name is Abraham Mizrahi. That's right. So, how many names do you have? But, have I done something wrong? We want nothing from you. We are here to take Antonio Alvares. Me? But why? Take him! Why are you taking me? Why are you taking me? I’ve done nothing! We do not Judaize. We do not Judaize! We do not Judaize! Let us go! Let us go! We do not Judaize! Let us go! Let us go! The big thieves are arresting the little ones! The big thieves are arresting the little ones! The dog that killed Jesus Christ! Do you have no shame? Deicide, rogue, evil! Mr. Visitator. Arrests are taking place all over the city. There are many more to go. There are 128 converts accused of Judaism. Who are they? Merchants, doctors, lawyers. Even priests and nuns. And are all of them guilty? How can we presume their innocence… …if it means presuming our own stupidity? Due to the ongoing hearings to verify their guilt, maybe it isn't necessary to put them right away in cells. Everything will be rigorously investigated. The New Christians escape from Porto with the help of countryside Christians. They take boats that await them at sea, on the river. I won't let them get away. I have called a Visitator of foreign ships to personally inspect all of those which dock at Porto or in the region. Any ship captain that intends to embark anyone… …will be arrested and charged with supporting heresy. Visitator, the President of the Court of Appeal says he wishes to speak to you at your convenience. Tell him I do not have the time. As you wish. What is the reason for this friction with the President of the Court? I’m keeping… …a surprise for him. By order of Visitator Sebastião Noronha, this detainee will remain at these installations. The jail of the ecclesiastical court is full. This court and this prison are the home of His Majesty, the King. And here I give the orders. Please, sir. Grant shelter to this poor soul. Otherwise, we will have to transfer him to the prison of Coimbra. Mr. Mayor, please stay calm. The charges against the defendant and his wife-- What charges hang over this man? That they observe the Sabbath, fast on Mondays and Thursdays, consume products other than meat. And deny Mary's virginity in observance of the Law of Moses. Terrible accusations! And who witnessed all this? Very well. To make sure that Dr. Nicolau Lopes is well treated, I accept to have him in this court. But I will have no one else here! It is a promise made in good faith. Come with me, Mr. Nicolau. My prison will be a temporary refuge… …in the presence of such injustice. The detainee and his wife will find peace with Christ. We are certain of it. Christ? Christ did not order people to be arrested and killed for a crime of religion. Nor for centuries did the councils or the popes order such a thing! Good morning, Julio. Friar Campos, I am very worried. I haven't heard from my granddaughter Filomena since yesterday. Your granddaughter is fine, don't worry. -She's helping. -Helping? -She is in a cell. -She is in prison? Be calm. She offered herself to the Holy Office. She is in a cell, among Jewish women, so she can witness their Judaizing practices. She is an informer. Unfortunately, I have a false and envious granddaughter. Do not say that. What is wrong with it? The Jews are a despicable people! Despicable? This is their land, they are the oldest people in Iberia. We are witnessing a historic moment. The streets of this city are about to be cleansed of Jews. Some arrested. Others on the run. Just this evening, three families set off to Amsterdam. We should think about doing the same. There is a Portuguese Jewish community there. We will be admitted if we prove Jewish matrilineality. And will we be well accepted? Amsterdam Judaism is full of rigors. It seems the rabbis have already threatened some Portuguese Jews with excommunication. Herem. Your Excellency. Release this man. Mr. Visitator Sebastião Noronha, please believe me, I abide by the Christian laws, I do not Judaize, I've never done it. Who have accused me? Whoever did it probably is the most envious of people, it's a poor envious, without dignity and without a soul. Consider the following commandment of the Decalogue, "You shall not covet your neighbor's house, nor his wife, his male servant, his ox, or anything that is your neighbor's." It is the last commandment. Why the last one? Because it is the most difficult one to keep. The Holy Office is a horrific institution. -It kills people! -No. The Holy Office obeys laws. Excommunicates people and hands them over to secular justice. Secular justice strangles the excommunicated and sometimes burns them alive. Your accusations do not weigh on my conscience. I am horrified by the death of human beings. But Saint Thomas Aquinas asked, and rightly so, "If con minters die for their attack against the Kingdom, shouldn't also die those who attempt against Christ and try to corrupt the whole society?" "Attempt against Christ?" This is false! I’ve never done it! How-- how can you accuse me of such an evil thing? I work to serve Christ. Not to serve evil. What will become of me? What will become of my family? I shall confess, Antonio, I believe the witness who accuses you… …is daughter of envy. And if I reach that conclusion, I will release you… …and punish her. Why do we harbor them, Artur? -We could be arrested! -Calm down. They will leave at dawn. We will never see them again. -Where will they go? -I don't know. They'll go to where the sea takes them. May Christ guide these unfortunate souls. I still don't understand. I don't know what is said in Turkey. Judaism was banned in Portugal 120 years ago. The new generations grew up without synagogues, without schools, without literature. They had to subject themselves to the discipline of the church. -What about Hebrew books? -We don't have any. Since a long time ago. Word is that Mocatta have one, but it's probably the only one. In my grandfather's time, there was still a small synagogue on Rua de São Miguel. Nobody takes chances anymore. Today, in this city, living in a house with Jewish books or Jewish objects would be suicide. If there are no Jews in Porto, how come they leave directly from here to Antwerp, Damascus, or Thessaloniki, and take their places in the synagogues? The feeling of Jewish belonging is very strong. You know that. -Mr. Visitator. -Get the wagons ready. I want you to take all the prisoners to Coimbra. It shall be done. And, Lucilio, the journey must be made at night. Leave Porto through these streets. They're taking the prisoners to Coimbra. Before our eyes is the stain with which, since the beginning of this situation, they have sought to mark the accused with. What if we are sentenced? We will lose our possessions and be publicly punished, for the eternal dishonor of our families. They're destroying the life of this city. Even Old Christians were arrested for Judaizing. Only homeless and plebs will remain here. Fernandes, let the Corregedor know. He shall surround the ecclesiastical building. No more prisoners will go to Coimbra as long as this continues to be a great series of abuse. In the name of the Holy Office, withdraw at once! Stand back. …forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. Hail Mary-- Yes! Mr. Visitator, I am afraid I have some bad news. Our building is surrounded by city guards. That's an insult to the Holy Office! I will report it to the King! City authorities have forbidden us from taking more prisoners to Coimbra. There will be consequences. The King will have everyone arrested! And what shall we do? Mr. Mayor, the guards have withdrawn. I don't understand. Withdrawn? The Visitator gave in to the authorities. But said he will report this to the King. He is going to accuse us of protecting the Jews. You Jews will go for nothing, for such bad people you are! You Jews will go for nothing, for such bad people you are! You are afraid of the stake! This wretched thing continues to disturb the public order? He is the biggest gossipmonger in town. This time, he will be judged for it. Stay calm. Stay calm! Everything will be alright. We leave today. We will leave Portugal in the past. Bishop! The Jews are fleeing, and no one is watching over the city gates! Don't worry, Father Monteiro. Christ and Mary were also Jews. Let them go. Your most Revered Excellency… …is a great example of Christian kindness. We will be accused by those who have already been arrested, and we will be tortured. We must go, Ana. I don't want to leave, father. I don't want to leave! There's no other way, daughter! In a few hours, we'll be on the high seas. Antonio and Adelaide will leave with us. I want to see Daniel for the last time. Don’t you understand, he would be the first one to arrest you? As he already has arrested many of us! I have already lost your mother. -I won't lose you as well. -No. I have no friends among you. Nor do I need you. And I must uphold the law. Civil law requires that I arrest you. Divine law commands me to honor father and mother. I am Jewish! I will leave with you. I always knew that Daniel believed in the Jewish Messiah. Pedro, will the boat reach its destination? The Jews have always been on the run from the fury of cruel people. They've faced long journeys full of dangers and… …and they are still alive. What about Daniel, will he marry Ana? He will never marry. Wherever he goes, Daniel will only devote himself to the law. Is your family of Portuguese or Castilian origin? Both. The Jewish families who lived in Portugal and Spain before the expulsions were essentially the same. Someone asked me a few days ago why the Spanish colonization was much more violent than the Portuguese one. If both peoples are Germanic, how do you explain this difference? The Portuguese are Germanic mixed with Jews. All of them will arrive in Amsterdam and try to prove that they are children of Jewish mothers. That they are Jewish under Jewish law. Judaism is a genealogy, more than a religion. Such a simplistic conclusion does not come from our holy scrutiny. A Jewish woman can marry an Old Christian because her children will always be Jewish. There are weddings of Jewish men with true Christian women. These marriages, the fruit of uncontained love… …are uncommon. The children of those marriages are no longer Jews. Your Majesty, the case I bring before you takes place in Porto, at the north of Portugal. Where a lot of the Jews are protected by the city authorities. Explain your intentions. The former Bishop, Monsignor Gonçalo de Morais, was surrounded in the Episcopal Palace for failing to comply with a sentence of the Court of Appeal. They have done now the same during the Visitation I directed. When the Jews were expelled from Spain, Rabbi Isaac Aboab, the greatest authority in the Jewish world at the time, chose to move to Porto with more than thirty other families. Why did he choose Porto? I am unable to answer Your Majesty. He certainly knew he would be welcomed in the city. Porto is a special case. Jews and Christians have always lived together peacefully. They are mixed in blood and culture. Yes. But, Your Majesty, this is disrespect-- What were the results of your visit to Porto? Many Jews were arrested and will face long trials. Others left for Amsterdam. Amsterdam. Two decades ago, nothing existed. But a beautiful girl and a handsome boy met on the boat they escaped on. It was the beginning of the community. It is romantic.
