MY NEW ADDRESS IS... PAPER FLAGS Hello. I'm doing a survey about rehabilitation of French prisoners released without parole. Could you answer a few questions? Come in, I've got a few minutes. Want something to drink? I have coffee or fruit juice. No, I'm fine, thanks. I'm all ears. What? For your survey. What would you like to ask? So, the first question... What effect can being released after so many years have on someone... Could you wait in the living room? I'll be right there. Sure, I'll wait there. Miss? I'm coming. Vincent. When did you get let out? Two days ago. Where have you been staying? I... Outside, on the streets. Aren't they helping you? Isn't there a center? They've washed their hands of me. I tried to call Dad and he hung up, but I... I don't know. He heard my voice and hung up. He won't pick up now. How did you find out where I was? Did you keep the note? It's not hard to lose in such a small cell. How old are you? 22? 23? - 23. - 23. You forgot who I was. But you... You're just how I imagined you. Meaning? - I imagined you like that. - I didn't. - Don't you recognize me? - I do, but... People change, don't they? Want to see what else I kept? Wait a second. Do you need a room? You want somewhere to stay right? - You can stay. - Don't feel obliged. It's the least I can do, right? I don't mind I think so anyway. Thank you. It's not very big, but there's a guest room. That would be perfect, really. I'll help you with your things. I guess... No. Just you. That's right. It's a little small but should be comfortable enough. It's great. Why did you stop coming? I'll leave you alone to settle in. This was mine, wasn't it? Yes. - Where did you find it? - In an old box. Got a smoke? Here, keep them. I should quit. I smoke way too much, it's gross. Got a light? Charlie? Sorry. So, talk to me. - About what? - I don't know, everything. Are you studying? Are you working? Tell me about yourself. I'm an artist. - What kind of artist? - I do drawings. I do sketches and graphics. - You do what? - Graphics. It's... I scan my drawings onto a computer and I color them digitally. Can I see one? - I don't know. - Come on. I don't care. Just a sketch, even. - Maybe later. - Go on. Later. Go on. It's nice. Is this yours? Do you owe it? You mean own it? Own it. No, one of Dad's old friends rents it out to me for not too much. I own next to nothing. It's empty. I feel it belongs to nobody. The furniture and decoration is creepy, right? And what was prison like? It was... It was long. 12 years is long. But after 7 years you don't feel much and after 10 even less. I'll lend you some money for the week. Vincent. Vincent, you'll need to get a job if you want to stay here. I can't afford to support us both. I will find something. I'm going to help you. I have an appointment with social security tomorrow to sort out my healthcare. I won't be here but I'll find the address. Good night. Sleep well, Charlie. You too. Goddammit! Move forward! Pass the ball! Come on! Pass it. Vincent? Vincent, I'm back. BANK ACCOUNT IN ARREARS OVERDRAFT LIMIT EXCEEDED BY 250 EUROS - "Hello, Charlie." - That's mine. "Today I saw a stunning lake below the mountains." "I imagined you were here with me looking at that globe in your room." "The Tibetan mountains are covered in snow." "Mom is at the temple. Everyone has been so kind." "I've missed you so much." "Take care of yourself, give your dad a hug from me," "and I hope your brother isn't losing his temper too much." She was scared of me. What are you looking for? What are you doing? Do I need to put a padlock on my door? We're going to set a few house rules. Rule number one, stay out of my room. Two, don't touch my things. You're scared of me too. Do I scare you? No. Rule number three, trim those eyebrows and grow your hair. You look like a skinhead. Vincent? Did you go out for a while? I went for a run. Did you see anyone? - Did you go to social security? - Yes. How did it go? I filled something in but now I need to wait for an email but I don't have one. I don't get these things. I can help you. What are you thinking? About before. 12 years ago. It's all coming back. I can see you as a kid. And I can see them. I hardly remember anything. Was it Dad who stopped you visiting me? Do you see him often? What is he like now? He has his garage, he's doing well. I see him at Christmas and sometimes on birthdays. When I have to. Do you think I should try and see him? Or at least call him again? I don't know. Give him some time maybe. Did he ever talk about me? I don't know Vincent, I can't remember. ADS Call this one, dial 06 16 49... - 95 54. - Wait, slow down. - OK, 06... - 06. - 16... - 16. ...49... - 95... - 95. - 54. - 54. - Hello, yes. - Speak quieter. Hi, my name is Vincent Tellier.

Thanks. - He won't call back. - What am I going to do? Shall I make something up or what? Didn't you work? I did a few courses but we were in the country, so nothing huge. There was a waiting list, I wasn't high on it. Make it up then, for now. OK, fire away. - OK, let's try this one. - OK. 04 93... 04 93... Hello there. My name is Vincent Tellier.

What? No jokes? Is that it? I have to go to work. Carry on calling them, I've circled you some. Call me if you need me. Thanks. Buy some decent clothes with that if you want to find a job. Later. These pants are nice, though. Hello, madam. My name is Vincent Tellier. I'm calling about your job advert in the newspaper. I've done lots of little things. Small jobs. It's expensive here, isn't it? OK. - Hello. - Hello, sir. - Need a bag? - Yes, please. That's 39.90 euros, please. Sir. 39.90 euros, please. Thanks. Sir. Your change and receipt. - Bye, have a nice day. - You too. 54.80 euros, please. WHAT YOU DOING? Do you have a loyalty card? 40.23 euros, please. Thanks. I'll be closing after this lady. 1 NEW MESSAGE I'M GOING OUT WITH SOME FRIENDS, EAT WITHOUT ME Hey. - Hey. - Hi. Why are you here? To see you. This is my friend Vincent. He's been up north and has just got back to the area. How long have you been back? A week. And what do you do? What do you mean? What do you do in the area? I'm looking for a job. - I'd better get going. - You're leaving? Yeah, I... Good night. - Bye. - Bye. Vincent. Vincent, I'm sorry. You caught me by surprise. Charlie, don't start. Don't start? What did you want me to say? "This is Vincent. He's been in jail" "and I haven't seen him for a while. 12 years to be exact." Vincent, listen. What could I say? "This is my brother," might be a good start. Are you that ashamed of me? How do you think I feel? Go on, run back to your friends. They're not my friends. They're just a bunch of randoms. It's just a friend of a friend who introduced me. - It's bullshit. - Is that what your life is? All day at a supermarket and all night in some crappy bar with friends who aren't your friends. Screw you. Is your life any better? I was fine before you got here. I just don't want my little sister to waste her life. I know what I'm talking about. Anyway. I'm freezing my ass off. Me too. Shall we? - Vincent. - What? The car's parked back there. I thought you were quitting. I am quitting. What are you shaving? - You have nothing. - It's neat. Should I button it up to the top? No, leave the top button undone. - This one? - No, this one. I'll drop you off. - Nervous? - No. I'll wait for you here. - Do you think I can do it? - Yes. We didn't drive here for nothing. Don't forget what I said. Smile. Go on. You can do it. - So? - It went well. - Really? - Yes, I have a trial shift and if it goes well... A steak for table 3. Quick. It's fine. Pass the broom. Chef, table 9, please. - Bravo, team. - Thank you. - How many did we do today? - 59, I think. That's good. - Well done to our newbie, Vincent. - Bravo. Thanks. How was he, chef? The start was tricky but he made up for it. How was it for you, Vincent? Not bad, I'm a little tired. That's normal for the first shift. - To Vincent. - To Vincent. To Vincent. Just look where you're going next time! What did you say? Are you deaf as well? - Come on. - Are you laughing at me? Calm down, we're kidding. Don't tell me to calm down, OK? Are you OK? Chill out. - He's sick. - You think I'm sick? I'm sick, am I? Am I the sick one? Break it up, guys. Let go of me! You bastard! Your first shift. You messed up your first shift. You can't control yourself, can you? You get a kick from it, don't you? I defended myself. How old are you? Well? How old are you? You can't just barge in on my life and mess everything up. I live by myself. I make a pittance each month. I buy my clothes at work. Do you know how much it is to fill the tank? Do you know how hard it is trying to forget about money worries? You don't. You know nothing. You're going to need to try harder because I can't do this all alone. Not all alone! I'm your little sister, Vincent. I'm not your mom. I can't fill that role. Why are you like a 16-year-old? I learned nothing in prison, goddammit! Do you think they taught me how to act like a normal person? Like a sane person. What do you think, Charlie? Tell me what I need to do to be a better person, then. All I left with was 60 bucks, a lighter, forms to fill in and shrink meetings. Where's the guy who's meant to teach me how to live my life, goddammit? If I seem like a 16-year-old it's because that's what they did to me. I think about that place all the time. I have nightmares about it, I'm constantly haunted by it. The only time my head is clear is when I'm thinking about you. It comforts me. I'm the older sibling, Charlie. Vincent? I'm in the shower. Want to go out tonight? I don't know. Where? I know a nice place. It'll do us good, right? Yeah, OK. OK. Ah, crap. What are you doing? - I want a piggyback. - Get down, damn it. I'll get the car towed. Have you seen the state of you? No one will want to. Why did you park so far away? - It's been towed. - What? It's been taken. It was parked right there. No, Charlie. Wait... Enough with your jokes, it's freezing. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. - Get in. - I'm coming. Come on, Charlie. Give me your keys, I'll drive. You? No, the club bouncer. Obviously, me. - Come on. - You don't know how to drive. I mean, really... You don't even have your license. You can't drive like that. - But I'm fine. - Come on, get out. I'm in a perfect state to drive. Come on, get in the back. - Charlie. - Wait. Mind your head. Right. I don't want to die, OK? With all the cars I've stolen I could open a garage. That was 12 years ago. It's like riding a bike, you never forget how to. Crap. Well, Mad Max, remember how to use the clutch? Off we go. Let's see if I remember how. Stop it. Stop. This feels so good. Holy crap, this feels good. OK, let's get you home safe and sound. IT'S CHRISTMAS, I'M COLD I'M SURE YOU'RE EVEN PRETTIER NOW... ...MOM - You told me I could. - It's fine, I don't mind. Can I take the car? I have a meeting. - With whom? - A shrink. Where? - In Marseille. - Marseille? It's the prison shrink. I need it to get to work. You can take the train, it's quicker, it'll take 2 hours max. I'll leave you the house keys. - Mr. Tellier... - Vincent... - is just fine. - Your cigarette. So are we going to talk? Before I was inside you could still smoke at work. Well, I wasn't working then, I was only 18. What's this new address on your file? Where are you living now? At my sister's. How long will you stay? I don't know. - As long as I need, I guess. - How's it going with your sister? Do you both get on? She's brave. Charlie is very brave. Do they make you do this? Listen to me, I mean. No, I'm not court-appointed, if that's what you're asking. I choose to. I chose files from non-assisted inmates. I think it's important. I think you should be listened to. OK, interrogate me, then. This isn't an interrogation, Vincent. It must feel good to be out, doesn't it? Let's go to the tough questions. I was actually scared. I was terrified. I couldn't stop thinking about being released. It gave me panic attacks. I hoped it would be raining. It sounds dumb but feeling the rain on my face would let me know I was truly free. Were you seeing a psychologist during your stay? My stay? Twice a week to begin with. With... I don't remember his name. Then it was Dr. Sainte-Rose. By the end, it was once every three months. Have you been looking for work? I've been applying. But I don't have a CV so they just say they'll call me back. I can always hope, though. I read in your medical file that you have behavioral issues. I break everything when I get mad. Everything goes blurry and dark and I only wake up when things get broken. But I don't get mad so much anymore. There was nothing to break in my cell. Have you had an outburst since you've been out? Are you resentful? Are you mad at someone? At myself. Only at myself. Only you can see that. You know what people are like here. All they have in life is gossip. I need that. You jerk. What are you doing? I was out running, I saw you were still here. How did it go? Want to drive? I've got a job interview soon. If I get it, I'll take you to the seaside. Hello. - Nice to meet you. - You, too. Please, take a seat. Thanks, it was nice of you to call back. So you want to work here? I wouldn't be in your office otherwise. Why? I really need a job and also I like manual work and plants. I saw you were looking for someone, so... Don't you have a CV to show me? No. What have you done? - I was working in a restaurant here. - Waitering? Yes, a bit of everything. Done anything else? I was a salesman too. It was in a shop, I was a salesman. - You can go. - What? You can leave. But why? How can I trust a liar to look after my plants and my customers? You need a job, right? Yes. If you want a job you need to be honest. If you don't have any experience just say. I need an honest worker here. Shame, you seem like a nice guy. I was in prison. For what? I got into a fight with someone and it ended badly. It was a long time ago. Things are different, now. I'm different. I want to work. I want to live. I have a little sister that I want to care for. I'm not good at all this. You know... interviews and all that. I don't know how to do it. What do you want me to do? Shall I go? What do you want? A job. I want a job. That's it. OPEN MONDAY TO SATURDAY 8:30 A.M. to 8 P.M. Charlie. Come. Want a smoke? - Have you quit? - Yes. Three days ago. I'm trying. Don't breathe on me. Let's see how long it lasts. Shut up. Is it because of your new guy? What guy? The guy at the bar that time. He's my brother. Your brother? Yes. You have a brother? You never told me. Well, now you know. I have a brother and his name is Vincent. Why didn't you say? He was in prison. Ah, I see. You're all a little nuts, aren't you? Hey. Hey. I'm Emma. Vincent. Been working here for long? A year. Where were you? Inside organizing some plants. - I mean before you lived around here. - Sorry. Up north. I have family here so I moved back down. Are you from here? Yes, I've never left. Vincent? Sorry, I'm in a bit of a hurry. - Hello, anyway. - Hey. What's up? I'm going out. Who with? Just some guys from the nursery. Do you need the car? Yes, please. Thanks, I'm running late. - Have fun. - Good night. Want to dance? I don't really like this place. Ah, crap. I'm sorry, I only know this place. It's fine. Don't worry. No, it's not fine. - Pretty dress. - Really? Yeah. It's shiny. Let's go somewhere else. OK, let's go. To where? You've got a nice apartment. You were less shy at work. I'm not shy. Are you OK? - I have to go. - What? I have to go. See you on Monday at work. Happy birthday. You're crazy. That must've cost a fortune. 49 euros. - What? - You don't say how much it was. Let's see. Where were you last night? I'm never far away, you know. Like it? - Did you buy a cake? - Yes. No smoking. What are you making? - Oh no, Charlie. - What? It's your special day, we're not eating pasta. Do you think this is a restaurant? Not for me. It's your birthday, OK? Let's make an effort. - Let's see what there is. - Nothing. A nice Alaskan pollock with lemon sauce and saffron rice, perhaps? - A ready meal. - But I'll cook it for you. Smell this. Trust me. Smell it. Anything to drink? Charlie, you've turned 24, let's drink to that. Expecting anyone? Happy birthday, Charlie. Here. Hello, Dad. Hi, Dad. I'm not ready for this. Dad. Dad! Dad, open up! Dad, please stay. Open the door. Open up. Dad. Please. It's almost ready. How's Catherine doing? - Good. - Couldn't she come? I wanted it to be just the two of us for your birthday. I've transferred you some money into your account as a gift. You shouldn't have. I know you're struggling at the moment. Vincent helps me out, he's working. - I also have a job, so... - Anyway I've done it now. He's working at the nursery. It's not too far and he really likes it. Right? Yeah. I'm sorry. My head's all over the place, I'll get something to clean up. Let me help you. Vincent's been seeing a psychiatrist. Soon he'll be done with it. Yeah, soon they'll leave me alone. Your pasta is so good. Working at the supermarket still? Yes, I am. I was thinking we could go on vacation together soon. Of course, you'd choose the place. - Dad. - What? Please make an effort. Speak to me, Dad. Say something. Dad, look at him. Look at him. He is your son. Does that mean we have to love each other? Just because we're family? - Can I take some more? - No. Make an effort. You haven't spoken to him, seen him or written to him - in 12 years. - Charlie, stop. Make an effort. Make an effort. Make an effort. Look at him. Look at him. Look at him. I have to go, I'm working this afternoon. We haven't had dessert. Happy birthday. What do I need to do for you to look at me? Is this what it takes? Do I need to do this? Is this what you want me to do for you to look me in the eye? Can you see me? Can you see me now? You've ruined it. Shut the hell up. Shut up! Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out of my house. I'll tidy up. Take your things and get out of my house. Get the hell out. Charlie. Stop it. What are you doing? - Put that back. - Stop! I can't take care of you anymore! I don't want someone violent here. Not in my house. - I'll fix everything. - You haven't. I don't want to feel unsafe. I don't want to feel unsafe in my own home. Why did you do that to me? Get out of my house! Come on, Charlie, open up. Open up, this is stupid. Come on, open up. Open the door, goddammit. Open up. Things can't end like this. Open up! Let me in! Open the goddamn door! Vincent. Vincent. Vincent? Vincent? I'm closed now. Charlie. Are you OK? - What's going on? - Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? I said I'm fine. See you tomorrow. Hello. Looking for anything? No, I'm just browsing. - If you need any help, just ask. - Thank you. - Have a nice day. - You too. Vincent? Hello. Hello. It's Dad. Are you OK? Yes. I was wondering if you were free this afternoon. - No. - Are you sure? Why? Maybe we could grab a bite to eat or something. Charlie? How's he doing? He's doing just fine. I think so anyway. I'm sorry, Charlie. I'm going. Hello? Vincent? Yes. How are you? I'm fine. Are you OK? Yeah. I'm sorry, I left my phone in the car and didn't hear it ring. Can you hear me? Yes. It's nice to hear your voice. Yours too. I wasn't expecting to hear from you. Am I bothering you? Not at all, I'm just heading home. I was with... Whatever, it doesn't matter. Are you OK? Yes. Want to meet up? We can see each other, right? We could meet up. We could meet somewhere, I don't know, wherever you want. Or at my place. Anyway, you... Do you... Do you need anything? What about you? What about me? Do you need anything? Are you there? Yes, I'm here. Anyway, I... I need to get back to work. I'm at work. Bye, Charlie. - Wait. - What? I love you.
