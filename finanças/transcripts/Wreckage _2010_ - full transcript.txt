Turn that damned TV down. I told you to turn the damn TV down. Where the hell have you been, Jimmy? Who cares? I'm here now, ain't I? Where is my shit? Christ, chill out, bitch. Here. What you little shits watching? Yo, kid, give me that damned remote. What, am I speaking Chinese? Give me that remote. No. What did you say to me? We're watching. I don't give a shit. When I tell you to do something, you better do it. You ain't my Dad. You can't tell me what to do. Yeah? Get off me. You better learn some respect, boy. Don't ever touch me again. What you going to do, you little piece of shit, huh? Fuck you. Huh? Huh? Huh? What do you say? Jimmy, no! What do you say? Get off. Get off me, you crazy bitch. Get off. You piece of shit, huh? Huh? Go away. Put the gun down, Ricky. You better put that gun down. You gonna shoot me? Is that what you're going to do, boy? Jimmy, stop it. Ricky, put the gun down. Ricky, what did you do? Wesley, call an ambulance. Come on, Ricky. Let's get out of here. Wesley, call an ambulance, goddamn it. What are you doing, Ricky? Come on. Ricky, what did you do? Put that gun down. Ricky, no. How you doing, darling? Everything okay? My car died. You need some help? No. My boyfriend is on his way with a tow truck, and he should be here any minute. Well, in the meantime, do you want to pop the hood, let me take a look? That's okay. Tow truck will be here soon. Oh, come on, now. You know, what kind of harm will it do? Let me just take a look. Yeah? I guess not. All right. Shit. The battery's dead. It's probably the alternator. Mm, that's what I figured. I'd give her a jump, but I don't think this thing takes cables. You know about cars, huh? My daddy taught me just enough to not get ripped off at the Jiffy Lube. Good man, your daddy. My name's Kane, by the way. Savannah. Very nice to meet you, Savannah. Well, can I give you a ride somewhere? No. Tow truck will be here soon, I'll be fine. That's right. You mentioned that he was coming. Okay. Well, thanks for trying to help, though. Oh, it's the, uh... It's the least I could do. Plus, you remind me of my little sister. You know, Savannah, it's, um... it's awfully cold. You're more than welcome to wait in my truck until your boyfriend gets here. No, I'll be fine here. Savannah, Savannah, Savannah, I got to tell you. It's pretty dangerous for a pretty girl like yourself to be out here all alone, in the middle of nowhere. Now, my truck's warm and safe, and I won't bite. Seriously, I don't bite. Hmm. Okay. All right. It's right over there. It's unlocked. There you go. All units, all units, prisoner at large. I repeat, prisoner at large. Roger that. Who is it? Inmate 868621, Wesley Jones. Copy that. What was he in for? Double homicide. Shot his mom and boyfriend when he was a kid. Now, ain't this better? Thank you for helping me. Of course, of course. It's what any gentleman would do. Hope someone would do the same for my little sister, you know. All right, folks, sorry for interrupting, but we have a special news report. At approximately 11:30 this evening, an inmate at the state prison escaped. Police are on the scene, and a countywide manhunt is underway. The prisoner is considered extremely dangerous. If you have any information, please contact your local police. Bet you're happy I'm here now, ain't you? Don't you worry, Savannah. Any convict comes through this way is going to have to come through this. Oh. So, uh, where did you say that boyfriend of yours is coming from? Uh, Spring Valley. It's 20 miles up the road. Right. How long ago did you say you called him? Just right before you pulled up. Uh-huh. You know what I'm thinking, sweetheart? Uh-uh. I'm thinking you never called your boyfriend, because you ain't got no cell phone reception. And I'm thinking that... we're out here, all alone, in the middle of nowhere. I'm thinking you got one hell of a pretty face. Please. I don't want any trouble. Oh, neither do I. Sweetheart, this is going to go one or two ways, all right? This could be real pleasant for the both of us, or it could get really ugly. No, don't do this. You're 18, right? So you're old enough. You know the sound a woman makes when she's having an orgasm. It's the same sound she makes when she's being stabbed to death. Oh. Now, I need to hear either one, you know, so... You're only making it worse. Help! Help me! Please help me! Please help me! Please help me. Please. You got nowhere to go. Oh, my God. Help me, oh, my God, help! Front door's to the right. You sweet little thing. Please. Please. Okay, okay. ♪ Marco ♪ Polo ♪ Savannah ♪ Kane.

Maybe it's Charles Manson. Charles Manson? Shit, he's not even up here. He's in California somewhere. Besides, he ain't... he ain't no real serial killer. It's probably that, uh... Juan Corona fella.

So does the air that comes out of your mouth. Can you fix it? Well, not unless you got a belt hidden somewhere in there. All right, well, how are we gonna get home? I don't know. And of course, I have no reception. Do you have any? Mm... Ah, Jesus Christ. No. Shh... Nada. Well, I suppose that, uh, you haven't gotten a cell phone in the last 12 hours.

Well, I am open for suggestions. Okay, why don't you two push the car back, Kate can steer, and I can lie in the back? That's a great idea. Now, is she always this crazy, or is this just the hormones talking? Hey, hey, no, no, no, no, welcome to my-my world. You're a fucking asshole. All right, look, there's got to be something that we can do. Let's focus. What can we do? Guys, it's only four... it's four miles. No way. I am not walking back from there.

Oh, Jesus Christ, baby, listen, you're pregnant, okay? You're not... you're not crippled. Oh, besides, you could stand to lose a few pounds. Fuck you, you piece of shit. Oh, shit. You see?

Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait a second. Guys, what about me? Hey, just stay there, Fatty. We'll be back in a few. Fuck that. You coming? Yeah, I'm fucking coming... you shit. Oh. Oh, she's throwing her shoes, throwing her shoes. Any old American model should work. I'm gonna check this guy out. I don't like it in here. Me, either. It gives me the creeps. That's because this is haunted. This place was built on top of an old Indian burial ground. How do you know? I used to come here all the time when I was a kid with my dad. He knew the old Indian guy that ran the place. He used to tell us, how late at night, he'd hear screams and ghosts of his slaughtered ancestors. Wait. Listen. What? Shh. Listen. What? Do you guys hear that? He's just messing with you, baby. Hey, I'm serious. You are such a liar. No, I'm not lying. I used to come here all the time when I was a kid with my dad. The old Indian guy lived here. He died in here, too. Oh, yeah? How did he die? Some say suicide. Others say murder. Well, would you just quit screwing around and help me look? Ah, I don't know. Jesus! Oh, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen. Yeah, so much for your no dog theory. Huh? I'm still working on the kinks. Hey, will you just quit screwing around and help me look? Oh, fuck. Fuck you. Yeah, that one's locked. Let go. Fuck. Hey, yo, Jared, I think I found one, man. I think you're right. Is it gonna work? Ah, it should. How long do you think it'll take? Oh, not too long. Ah, this place is wild, isn't it? It's like an old cemetery for cars, each with its own unique story. Oh, Jesus, like this fucking truck. What about it? A family died in this truck. Yeah, right. No, I'm serious. My dad told me the story. He knew 'em. What happened? It happened, like, 20 years ago. Get this. Husband, wife, newborn baby, heading home from the hospital, get in a head-on collision with another car. Husband dies instantly, head severed clean off his body. Wife and baby weren't so lucky, though. Wife's legs were crushed underneath the dashboard. She was stuck with the newborn baby in her lap, and her husband's head sitting next to her. Truck catches on fire, and they both slowly started to burn to death. And she's screaming, you know, desperately trying to get her baby out the window, but the window's rolled up, and... she can't reach the handle. And the fire engulfs them, and they... both die. It's rumored that people could hear the screaming from miles and miles away. But right before she died, fire reaches the gas tank and... Jesus fucking Christ! Fucking idiot, Rick. Holy shit, you should have seen your faces. What the fuck, dude? Did you forget to take your Prozac? Jesus Christ. Come on, man, you should have seen it. It was the funniest fucking shit in the world. You should have seen their faces. Give me that. What? What the... what the hell are you doing with this? What, man? Come on. There's bears, mountain lions, some rabbits, gophers, what? Just keep it on safety and put it away. Jesus. Fucking idiot. Babe, how much longer is it gonna take? 'Cause I really don't want to be here anymore. Soon. - Yo, uh, J? How much you give me if I hit this, uh, mirror off this old van right here? Nothing. Come on, man. It's a tough shot. Stop shooting that thing! Oh, yeah! Holy shit, what a shot! You're such an idiot. Dude, quit messing around. One last shot. One last shot? Okay, girls? Don't. Girls, cover your ears. Stop shooting it! Don't! Hey, asshole, if you fire off one more shot... Jared? Kate. Kate? Kate?! Oh, my God. Oh, my God, what the fuck did you do, man? What the fuck did you do?! I was just aiming over here, man! Goddamn it, Rick. Oh, shit. Oh. Oh, God! Oh, shit. Oh, baby, it hurts. All right. I know. Baby, it hurts. I know it does. Baby, it hurts, it hurts. Stay calm, stay calm, all right, listen to me. Okay, the more relaxed and calm you are, the less the bleeding is going to be, okay? I'm gonna go get you help, you understand? Hey, man, I'm sorry. I was just aiming over there, man, I was just aiming over here, and it just... Not now, Rick! Fuck. All right, I need you to put pressure down, okay? Just keep her calm. Can you do that for me? Okay, yeah. What are you gonna do, man?! I'm gonna go run back into town, okay? Hey, look, hey, hey, honey. You see that? Oh, fuck. You see that? That means we're getting married. Fuck. Fuck! Fucking hurts. Ow. Oh, fuck, I'm sorry, Kate. I'm sorry, Kate. You fucking asshole! I can't believe you just fucking did that! What the fuck's your problem?! If she dies, you're going to jail, you fucking motherfucker! Fuck! Oh, my God. Will you marry me? Oh, my God, oh, my God, yes, yes, yes. I was just aiming over there, man. I was just aiming over here. What are you gonna do, man?! Is that a yes? I was just aiming over here. Is that a yes? What are you gonna do, man?! Yes? What are you gonna do, man?! Hey, hey, hey, hey, what the hell are you doing, son? My girlfriend's just been shot. You got to go get help. What's happening? Kate, Kate-- she's been shot. She's at the old junkyard on Highway 13. We got to go get her help. James, get on the horn to Dr. Richardson, tell her to meet us at Jay's Junkyard with the ambulance, and you stay here, hold down the fort. Stay here, all right. Bye. Get on the phone. Grab the stretcher. Well, all right, where are they? They were right here. They're not here now. What the fuck? They were right here. Kate! Rick! Is this some kind of a game you're playing? Kate! I swear to God, I told 'em to stay put. They were right here. 'Cause if you're fucking with me, I won't hesitate to throw your ass in jail. Why would I make this up, huh? Look, look at this. Does that look like ketchup to you? What the hell's going on? - I don't know. - Hey, Sheriff, maybe somebody came by and found 'em, took 'em to the hospital. No, that's impossible. Why? Because I would have passed them when I ran into town, or they would have passed us when we came back here. You don't know that for sure. You know of any other roads that come through here, genius? Don't you get smart with me, boy. You wouldn't know if I got smart with you. All right, knock it off. Now, look, there's, there's got to be a logical explanation to this. Your friends have to be here somewhere. We'd better hurry, Sheriff, she's bleeding. All right, let's split up. Now, uh, Faye, you go with him, check that lower area. Janet, you and I will circle around this way. Let's get out of here. Hey, Sheriff. Yeah? You have an extra gun on you? Yes, I do. Come on. Rick! Rick! Rick! Kate! Rick! Kate! What the hell were y'all doing out here anyway? I blew a belt, we were looking for a spare one. You find one? Hey, wait, wait. What? Listen. Did you hear that? What? Shh, be quiet. That-- did you hear that? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think it's over here. Rick! Jessica! Hello-- hello. Faye! Faye, where are you?! Faye! I'm over here. Oh, fuck! Sheriff, Sheriff! Get her down. Oh, fuck, Sheriff! Sheriff! No, Jessica! Sheriff! Oh, fuck! Get over here quick. Oh, fuck, Sheriff. Sheriff, get over here quick! Sheriff! Wait. Jessica! Oh, fuck... Oh, fuck. Jessica! Jessica! Two bullet wounds to the chest at point-blank range, which killed her before the laceration to the neck. The only good news is, she probably didn't suffer. All right, Smith, just what the hell is going on here? I already told you everything I know. No, you told me Kate was shot in the stomach. Now we got a girl here with two bullet holes in her chest. Now, what the fuck is going on?! I don't know! Goddamn you. Sheriff. Shut up! Now, you'd better start talking because right now you look guilty as hell to me. Listen, Sheriff, why would I come get you if I did this? That doesn't make any sense. Well, nothing makes any sense here, does it? Kate and I got engaged tonight. Now, I have to find her. I have to find her. Goddamn it. Sheriff, remember, we still got an escaped convict on the loose. Give me your radio. James, are you there? Yeah, I'm here, Sheriff. All right, call County and have them send backup as soon as possible. Then go down to the storage unit and get those AR-15s, and you get down here as fast as you can, all right? All right, I'm on it. All right, listen up. We're all going out front and we're gonna wait for backup. What about Kate and Rick? They're still out here. You wearing a badge?! Where the fuck are you going? To find my friends. I'm not just going to let her sit out here and die. What if she's dead already? Until I see her body, I'm gonna assume that she's alive. Now, you can either help, arrest me, or you can get the fuck out of my way. Suit yourself. I'm going with him. Me, too. Goddamn it, you're not going anywhere! Janet, you and Faye, go to the ambulance and stay there. Jared, Walter, and I will search for the kids. Now, you know how to handle this? Yeah. If anything happens, just blow those sirens, and don't forget you have that. Good luck, all right. Hey, Sheriff, how about one of those guns? He can use mine. All right, let's go. Kate! You all right? Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Insomnia-- he ain't had a good night's sleep in years. Right. Hey. What? Stay on our six, keep alert, make sure our flank is covered. Huh? Stay focused and cover our backs. Oh, okay. I got Barney Fife covering our backs. Oh, shit. What? Somebody let the dog out. What dog? Run! Oh, Jesus! Aah, get him off of me, get him off of me. Get him off of me, get him off. Aah, get him off of me, get him off of me, get him off of me. Christ. Fucking dog. Ruined my pants. Help me. Sheriff, we got another one. - Rick, Rick? Jared. Can you hear me, man? Oh, Jared. Fuck. Hey, you're okay now, man, we're gonna get you out of here. I'm sorry, man, I didn't see him coming. Who was after you? He came out of nowhere. And where's your gun? I don't know. Where's Kate? Man, he moved so fast. I tried to shoot him... Oh, fuck, I'm sorry. Rick, Rick, where's Kate, is she alive? I don't know. Now, he may be losing a lot of blood. Let's get him to the hospital right away, come on. Damn it, the ambulance. Come on, let's go, come on! I'm gonna come back and get you. Would you please get that gun out of my face? Now... I caught him, Sheriff, he was sneaking around. What's going on? Now, easy now, right, now just take it easy. It's all right, Faye, we'll take it from here. Now, who are you and what's your name? Take it easy. You're gonna make me shit on myself. My name is Frank Jeffries. My, my, my Uncle John-- he owns this place. So you're John Jeffries' nephew? Yes, sir. My mama is his sister Sadie. You don't know her. She got a big old eight-pound goiter coming out of her neck, so she don't leave the house. Well, what the hell you doing here? Well, the alarm here is wired up to the house. It triggered, so I figured I'd come down here and check it out, that's all. Where's your uncle? Why isn't he with you? Have you met my uncle? He's 83 and got a colostomy bag coming out of his butt. He ain't exactly in the best shape to be tracking down no burglars. So you just got here? Where's your car? I parked it on down the road. I figured if there were any intruders, I'd have me a much better chance of catching 'em if I snuck up on them. Well, why didn't you just call the police? I did, and all I got was a dang answering machine. Now, what the hell y'all doing down here? Well, now, there's been a murder. A murder? That's right, and what do you know about it? I just told you, I don't know nothing, I just got here. Where are the floodlights in this place? They're out yonder in the back shed. I could fire 'em up if you want. Got me the keys right here. Listen, you take the doctor over to your friend. Faye, you stay with Walter and wait for Deputy Berry. All right, let's go, come on. Come on. You know, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you wouldn't point that gun at me. Yeah, well, under the circumstances, your comfort is none of my concern. Shit, you think I did this? I don't know what to think. Now just keep moving, come on. You just be careful with that trigger finger. Damn kids. All right, the light switch is right in there. Well, go on in, turn it on. By myself? Well, it only takes one person to turn on a light switch. Yeah, well, I heard some jokes that say differently. Say, you ain't Polish, are you? Right over here in this car. Okay, okay. No, no, no, what the fuck is going on?! You're sure it was this car? Rick! Yes, I am sure. Okay, what was that noise? Get down and stay down. Okay. Keep quiet. You sure you don't want to go in there and clear the room first? Still locked, isn't it? Don't mean there ain't some nut job in there waiting to chop my head off. Hey. All right, I'm coming in there... and I got myself a gun. Can I borrow your gun? Get the fuck in there! All right, I'm going. Aw, shit, all right. And God said, "Let there be light." That's a relief, huh? I'll be relieved when this is over. It's kind of hot in here. You want to jump in the back? Okay. You all right? Why'd they turn 'em back off? I don't know. What the hell was that? That was weird, huh? Stay here. Wait, where are you going? To have a smoke and find out what the hell is going on. You should wait for the sheriff to come back. Honey, I'm a trained professional. Don't you go worrying about me. Must have blown a fuse. The lights haven't been on since Aunt Mamie got SARS. Well, where is it-- the fuse box? Over there, about a hundred yards. All right, after you, come on. Deputy? You okay? No. Oh, God. Oh, God. Are you okay? No, no! ♪ You know, believe it or not, this is where my mama and my daddy conceived me. Got me a blow job in here in junior high. Just keep walking. Boy, this ain't no blown fuse. Somebody done ripped this thing right out the box. Aah, boy! Did you see that? I can't fix that. Holy shit, not again. Come on. Sheriff. Grab his legs, I'll get him down. Lift him, lift him, lift him. The cable's too tight; get some cutters. Get the cutters, Janet, in my car, hurry. Hurry up! Hurry! Hurry! I can't find them, they're not there. In the backseat, goddamn it! Hurry! Get 'em. I got 'em, I got 'em. Get his legs up. Here he comes. One, two, three, four. Come on, breathe. Seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Two, three, four. Come on, breathe. Seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Sorry. He's dead. Oh, shit. Is that Walter? It is. What's going on here? Hey, Sheriff? Where's the backup? Why aren't they here? There's a fire up at the county line, and it's a mess, and no one's going to be here for a while. Okay. I want you to call in the state troopers, the FBI, the National Guard and every goddamned law enforcement agency this side of the fucking Pacific Ocean! We need backup! Yes, sir. Did you bring the guns? Yeah, they're in the trunk. Open it. Right. Hey, what do you think you're doing? Getting a bigger gun. Whosever out there has a nine millimeter now. What? What are you talking about? Deputy Riley's. So, what are you going to do with the guns? I'm gonna hunt down whosever doing this, and I'm going to kill him. Jared, you're not in the military anymore. This is no search and destroy mission. There are laws here that got to be followed! With all due respect, sir, fuck the law. I'm not waiting another goddamned second for this sick fuck to strike again. What's that noise? Sounds like somebody turned on the car crusher. You don't think... Where is it? Back of the junkyard. Can I get a gun now? Stay calm. I'm going to get you out of here. Hurry! Please, somebody! Okay, come on! How do you turn this thing off? Stop! Stay on the ground, try and get on the ground! Get on the ground. Get on the ground! Get on the ground! Faye! Help! Please help me! Get me out of here, please. : Get me out. Faye. Hold on. We're gonna you out. Just hold on. Please help. Get me out! Hurry. Hang on, he's coming. Get me out of here. We're gonna get you out. Please help. Just hold on. Get me out. Come on. Hold on, hold on. Damn it! Here, we got it. Oh, come on. We got it. Come on, you're okay. It's all right. - She all right? Yeah. Okay. Come on. Come on. It's all right. It's all right. You're okay. Faye, are you hurt? Did you see who did this? No, I didn't see who did it. What about the deputy? Is he... is he okay? No. He's, uh... he's dead. Listen. Oh, God. Listen, listen, do you remember who did this? Do you remember anything about what happened? No, I don't remember anything! I can't remember... I can't remember anything. I'm sorry. All right, come on. It's all right. Wait. Wait! I remember something. I remember his shoes. What? What are you talking about? Faye! All right, this is gonna end right now. Where's Faye? What happened to Faye? She didn't make it. What happened? I don't want to talk about it. Where's backup? - It's on the way. Sir, I just got off the horn with County. They said they found the body of the escaped convict. What? They're pretty sure it's him, but it's not confirmed yet. All right, I want everybody gone. I'm not going anywhere. Neither am I. There still may be people out there who need medical attention. And they may be dead. Hey! You don't know that. That's right, I don't, but the odds are leaning that way, aren't they? Now, look, I've just about had it, but I'm not going to have any more killings, and backup is on its way. Well, then, I'm going to wait for them. Yeah, me, too. This is not a democracy. You'll do as I say! Where's your flare gun? In the car. Now, listen, I'm not gonna try to stop you, but I advise you very strongly to stay here until help comes. Listen, if Kate is still alive out there, she won't be for much longer. You're willing to risk your life on that? I don't have a life without her. You're out there all alone. I work better alone. Here. I'll shoot this off if I find Rick and Kate need help. We'll come and get you. Now, wait, you just hang on a second. All right now, I'm going to go with you. I can help you find them. I don't need your help. Now you listen here. Last thing I want to do is be a hero, but the fact of the matter is, I know this place better than anyone here. I can be helpful, we can move fast. You up for this? Hell, no, but I'm going to do it anyway. Now can I have a gun? You know how to use this? Yeah, you just point it and shoot it, right? Yeah, something like that. Let's move out. Backup arrives, I'll hit the sirens. That's one brave kid. More like stupid. Shit. Shit. What branch of the military were you in? Please don't say the Coast Guard. Army. How long were you in for? Three years. Why-why such a...? Got shot in the leg, medical discharge. Golden ticket, huh? Not really. Shit! You like being an army grunt? Actually, I was a Ranger. We got treated a little bit differently. A Ranger. Oh, shit. A Ranger, huh? Shit. I'm starting to feel a lot safer already. Yeah? Well, as soon as you start feeling safe, that's about the time when you got shot. I wouldn't light that if I were you. Why? 'Cause it might give away our position? No. Lung cancer. These flashlights will give away our position. Hey, wait up! Hey, where did you go? Ow! All right, stay on my back, make sure we're covered from behind. Do you hear that? Don't move. Holy shit. Run! Oh, shit, oh, shit. I think we're getting shot at. Should I shoot? Should I shoot? Where should I shoot? Hey, hey, hey, relax, relax. Relax... I need you to stay calm. Relax? Are you friggin' crazy? I'm in a friggin' gunfight. I'm scared. Ow! Shit! Yeah, and you're shot. What? Oh, shit, I've been shot. Shoot the flare! Shoot the flare! Shoot the flare! Hey, hey, hey. It's just a graze. What the hell does that mean? It means you'll live. Oh, I don't know. I feel cold and weak. Hey, listen, I need to cover his flank, but I need you to lay down suppression fire until I'm clear. You got that? What the hell does that mean? It means you take this gun, you shoot that way until I'm clear, okay? On three. Ready? One. Wait, now, hang on a second. "One, two, three, go," or just "One, two, three"? Three. On three. Just don't shoot me. Fuck. One, two, three. Shit. Fuck! Looks like Jared found what he was looking for. I just hope it's not the other way around. Fuck! Hey, I think I found him! I think I found him. Come here, hurry. He's bleeding. Rick? Hey, man, can you hear me? Jared. Hang on, buddy. We're going to get you out of here. Fuck! Shit. You need a signal? Rick. Hey. Hey, where is Kate? Rick, where's Kate? Can you tell me where Kate is? Fire in the hole! Let's go. Deputy Berry will take you to the hospital. Wait. What about your girl? No, the sheriff's right. You should go. Sorry. If you want to go back in there and hunt down that son of a bitch, I'm with you. Somebody help me! Who's there? I found this girl on the side of the road. She needs help. Freeze! Stay right where you are. Don't take another step. Somebody needs to help this girl. Don't you move, not another fucking inch. Whoa, whoa, whoa, don't shoot. This girl's hurt really bad. She needs medical help. Kate?! Put the girl on the ground and back the fuck away! Easy, man. Back the fuck away from her! Put her slowly on the ground, keep your hands where I can see 'em, don't make any sudden moves. Wait a sec. I didn't do this. What the hell you doing out here? I was just taking a walk. I found her about a half mile up the road. I heard your sirens, so, I carried her here. What's your name? Peter Dobbs. Look, I'm just passing through town for the night. I'm staying in the Motel 6 for the night, room 308. Call and ask them if you want. Sheriff, we need to get her to a hospital right away. Put her in my car. You-- you're coming with us. What? I don't want any trouble. Just get in the fucking car. Don't say a word, come on. Tell Janet we're on our way. We have Kate. She's unconscious, she's lost a lot of blood. Be waiting for us in front of the hospital. Roger that, Sheriff. Uh, listen, the ID on the prisoner that escaped-- it doesn't match. Prisoner is still at large. Come again? Prisoner is still at large. It's him! It's him! Get that son of a bitch! Get that motherfucker! I don't want to fight you. You don't have a choice. Please. Please. I can't go back there. I can't go back to prison. Please, I can't go back. The only place you're going is hell. Why did you kill my friends? Why did you kill them?! Your friends? I didn't kill your friends. I never killed anyone. Bullshit! I'm a dead man. Why would I lie? 'Cause you're fucking sick. Why did I bring back the girl? You're a fucking liar. Is he dead? Oh, I... yeah, I wish I could remember. You know, it's all just such a blur. Yeah, well, you don't have to worry about that anymore. Why, did you kill him? Yeah. Always got to be the damn hero. You know what I can't get out of my mind? Uh-uh. Is right before he died, he said he never killed anyone before. Oh, yeah, right. He was innocent. Yeah, the fucked up thing is, I believed him. Why didn't he kill Kate, or you for that matter? Hey, man, it's not like he didn't try. Okay, you can't try and figure out people like that. Okay, he's insane. He's a textbook lunatic. Hey, how is Kate? How did surgery go? She's good, man. She's good. Good. Yeah, doctor said she's going to be fine. Good. Hey... Jared. I'm sorry. Just... Just about everything. I'm sorry, Kate. Sorry, Kate. Fuck you. Fuck you. One last shot. One last shot? Fuck! : I'm sorry, Kate... Kate... Kate. You fucking asshole! I can't believe you just fucking did that. What the fuck's your problem? Hey, shut up! - I didn't mean to, Jessica. - If she dies, you're going to jail, you fucking motherfucker! Hey, you're fucking hurting her! Jesus fucking Christ! Fuck you, you fucking... Shut up.

Oh, my God. I had the worst dream. Rick was in it. Me? It was so real. It's okay. It was just a dream. Look at me. It was just a dream. What were you dreaming? That... That you shot Jessica. What? It was so real, I... I screamed when he walked in. I'm sorry. It's okay. Yeah, and I also stabbed the deputy and hung him on a truck. Want me to get you something to drink? Do you want some water? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. It's funny you dreamt that, Kate. Why? Because it wasn't a dream. I'm sorry, Kate. : I also stabbed the deputy and hung him on a truck. Kate! I'm sorry, Kate. I'm sorry, Kate.
