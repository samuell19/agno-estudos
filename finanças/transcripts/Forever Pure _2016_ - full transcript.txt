BEITAR JERUSALEM F.C. I love you! -I love you! -I love you! I swear! I think about you always and forever Every minute, any place The police won't stop me My heart will always stay Yellow and black! Beitar, I'm with you till the day I die I hate Hapoel and hate Maccabi Yellow and black is in my heart Go, Beitar, we want to see you fight! Ariel Harush, Ole! Ariel! They talked about a crowd of a thousand, but there are at least 2,000 people here. Yes, way to go for these great fans. Just look at that wonderful sight. -Ariel! -They love us very much and I hope we'll be able to justify their love. Beitar Jerusalem, has a much deeper meaning than the game itself. For decades, it represented the Mizrahi Jews and the right-wing. Over the years, it became a political embodiment of "the other Israel". It was the team of the underprivileged. Suddenly, Beitar Jerusalem becomes an empire, the team of the country, winning titles and championships. Today we're the country, the second Israel has become the first Israel. Okay, guys, come on, let's go! Good evening from Teddy Stadium. Here is Meir Einstein. Twenty thousand fans are here to support a Beitar Jerusalem that seems to be back on track. The east stand, controlled by the radical fan group La Familia is fully packed. Remember the players who played for Beitar before you. This season, you have the honor of restoring our glory. Let's go! -All for one! -One for all, victory! So even when times are hard I'll be shouting your name on the streets Yellow flows through my veins Beitar, always and forever! The owner, Israeli Russian oligarch Arcadi Gaydamak arrives and the fans are booing. They don't forgive him for not investing real money in the club in recent seasons. ARCADI, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS? Football is not a very fascinating sport. In my opinion, anyway. So why does it attract so many fans? At the subconscious level, it is a clash between different groups. It is a kind of a war. The brave Harush saves Beitar. Most of the players, 80 percent, are home-grown. And on the bench, we have more talented players waiting for their chance. There's a strong connection with the team. The team is fighting and the fans love it. I love you! -I love you! -I love you! I swear! Think about you everywhere, every minute War! We are believers, the sons of believers And we have nobody to rely on Except our Father, our Father in Heaven Beitar Jerusalem has not lost a game in two months and is now in fourth place! I'm happy that the players and all of us infected Arcadi with our passion. From what you can gather, will he continue his support? The fact that he is here today says everything. If he stays and keeps up the good things, it will be good for Beitar. Arcadi Gaydamak, you're a son of a bitch You're a traitor, a war criminal Everyone knows you're corrupt And you'll go to jail in France We will haunt you day and night My dream is to watch you fall Undoubtedly, the owner's surprising return to the stadium raises questions. It's noteworthy that there is still a warrant for his arrest in France in connection with the arms dealing case known as "AngolaGate". The controversial Russian billionaire emerged in our life seven years ago when he invested hundred million dollars in Beitar Jerusalem, with the aim of becoming Mayor of Jerusalem. I never was a football fan. I always said that. But Beitar has more fans than all the other clubs in Israel combined. And this is why it's a very interesting propaganda tool. It has a huge influence on Israeli society. In 2008, I will be elected as Mayor of Jerusalem. The next Mayor! Thank you. Arcadi You're a star There's no one like you I adore you, who are the greatest He lost a huge amount of money in terrible business deals and Beitar was the first victim. After losing the elections, he said, "Do I care? Let it be relegated to second division." Without a doubt, this is the most bizarre headline of the week: Gaydamak is taking Beitar Jerusalem, in the middle of the season, to Chechnya, a Muslim country, for a friendly match. What is the meaning of this trip of Beitar Jerusalem, which has, among others, foreign Christian players, but everyone knows that Muslims are not their cup of tea. So what is Arcadi up to now? Have a safe journey. Is this your first trip to Chechnya? Yes. I hope it's not as bad as I've heard. I hope it will be fine. An experience. We've been well briefed. A lot of Muslims there who hate us. We mustn't leave the hotel, not go down to the lobby. If someone knocks on our door, we need to call them. CHECHNYA - CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE We should live in peace and friendship with everyone. Develop economic ties. Our prophet said, "You should develop economic ties with the Jews". He didn't say, "Kill them", but "Develop economic ties with them". We played a game, the score was nil-nil. Their President asked me before the game which score I would prefer, nil-nil, one-one or two-two? Ramzan sets major goals. We're doing everything to improve our image in the world... ...and that includes Israel. We invite investors to our republic, we show the world that we are not bandits, and we are achieving this through sport. I am convinced that it was a very big success, this trip, and we achieved the goal. Not in the game. In the game, we didn't achieve the goal. But outside of the soccer field, we achieved completely the goal. I scored the goal! Then, on a Saturday, I was coming out of the gym and my phone was blitzed with calls and messages. I asked myself, "Itzik, what is it this time? What's happened? What the hell could have happened during these two hours you are in the gym?" What could have happened? Has a war started? It turns out that Arcadi told this website that he had signed two Chechen players. I remember the headline: "Arcadi Gaydamak signs two Muslims for Beitar Jerusalem." Not "football players", not "new signings." The headline was, "two Muslims." Beitar Jerusalem was the only club that had never signed an Arab player. The only team. Over there? Let's go. How will you introduce yourself to the local fans? -Goals. -Yes. We will score. If we have time, Dzhabrail and I will go there every day. -Where? -Al-Aqsa Mosque, our mosque. To pray there and ask for God's help. -To help Beitar. -Yes, to become champions. Zaur, welcome to Israel! -How do you feel being here? -Okay. As it turns out, Gaydamak insisted that they come because of his business ties. It was for his own interests. When I questioned and tried to object, I was told "Look, he invested hundred million dollars into the club, he has the right to bring players in and do whatever he wants." I would like to welcome both players... On joining our team. I hope they will help us during this football season. If Coach Eli decided to bring them in they must be good players. Their religion or race doesn't matter. We will be the best hosts, give them the best feeling in the world, and I hope they will help us. -Mum. -Hello? Zaur? How are you? -Did you arrive okay? -Yes, everything is fine. Zaur, how did they welcome you? They welcomed us really nicely. I became a star! My other son also plays. He's at Beitar too, both of them are. They don't have any other option in this household. The Chechens have joined the training session for the 21st match of the season. With us on the line a Beitar fan and member of the La Familia organization who are known for their radical nationalistic views. If you had a daughter, would you let her marry an Arab? How's that even related? There are people who feel that Beitar Jerusalem is like their own child, -and treat it as such. -But you don't make these decisions! We are the team! This is our team! BEITAR TILL DEATH Good morning, everyone. This is a historic day for Beitar. First, I would like to introduce our two new players from Chechnya. Jabo Kadayev, that's his name. You'll remember it. And Zaur Sadiev. You will welcome them as you welcome all foreign players. -Welcome to Beitar. Good luck. -Thank you. Our hope is not yet lost The hope that is two thousand years old To be a free nation in our land The land of Zion and Jerusalem To be a free nation in our land The land of Zion and Jerusalem Guys, you remember Ariel Harush, the captain, you met him yesterday at the press conference. -He will help you with whatever you need. -Thank you. Come on, let's practice. You brought us two Muslims, not football players! Fuck you, Kadayev! -Sadayev, go to the Al-Aqsa Mosque! -What the hell, we have Arabs in our team? There is a new reality, and everyone will need to adjust to it. They don't represent Beitar fans, so I told them straight, if you keep behaving like this, we'll do everything to keep you out of Teddy Stadium. War! They think that we are Arabs? No. We're Chechen. Someone should explain we're not Arabs. They know that, but they have only one thing in their heads. I understand. Jerusalem, the most disputed city in the world, with the greatest significance, that goes to the core of a hundred years of conflict between Jews and Arabs in the land of Israel. It's Beitar fans whose grandparents are Arab speakers, some of them work with Arabs and so on. So there is friction that doesn't exist in other parts where people are so enlightened. Characteristically, Beitar fans are not self-righteous, they are saying, "There is a war, Jews are being killed here, so we are saying what you're not allowed to say." Our society is injured, that's for sure. Seeing a Middle-eastern looking man wearing a coat boarding a bus, you'll see a whole bus skip a heartbeat. Of course, everyone knows that not every Arab player is a terrorist, but they say "Look, I don't want any of it". Fuck you, Kadayev! Fuck you, Kadayev! Fuck you, Sadayev! Fuck you, Kadayev! Here we are The most Racist team in the country! A great chance for Beitar. But it's gone wide. Kadayev, go away! Go away! And Harush clears it. Screw you, Ariel Harush! Our captain is such a son of a bitch! What a son of a bitch, what a son of a bitch captain! What a son of a bitch captain! Itzik, quit, we don't want you anymore, go home you son of a bitch cop! Itzik you son of a bitch! You've ruined Beitar! It's gone in! One Zero to Ramat Hasharon! No fans, no wins, so stop trying! -How are you doing? -Okay. -Okay. -Really? What happened out there with the fans was bad. It could happen anywhere. I'm really missing home. I want to go back home. I've never been so insulted and sworn at by my own fans. It's my own fans, who just last week were cheering my name. Where did it go? Why is everyone against me now? I haven't done anything wrong. I did what the club told me to do and went to the press conference, and said that we will accept these players. And the fans turned against me. Because I posted on Facebook, saying I know it will be hard for them to accept this move but to support us, no matter how hard it is. Because we're having a great season, let's not ruin it. This season could get me to Europe, God willing. What I've always wanted. But I also need luck. Eighty percent luck, 20 percent ability. When you come onto the pitch, there's the purity of sport. To play and win. Suddenly, everything is turned upside down. The players can't comprehend that their own fans would boo them. Their supporters curse them, post offensive messages on Facebook with implied threats, direct threats. All the club's youth team players get free entry to the matches. And where do they seat them? In the east stand. Sitting there, they hear and absorb all the verbal violence and racism. Kriaf is more associated with the fans, and his brother is a member of La Familia. I don't know if he's one of the radicals. Beitar is my life. I've watched from the same spot in the east stand, since I was six. It's all coming together for me this season. When we started the season, there wasn't much money. They looked at the home-grown players and told me, "come, this is your chance to prove yourself. It's now or never." I realized that this was my opportunity to make my mark and become a crucial part of the team. How are you? I'm really tired. -This is my bodyguard. -What? You need a haircut. They gave me a new name. -Which name? -Jabo. And they pronounce my family name Kadayev. -Why Kadayev? -Who knows? They're trying to change everything about me. Make sure you play well. -Right? -Yes, Mum. Then the fans will love you. The goal is so big and they can't score in 45 minutes. Harush is a son of a bitch! Eli Cohen is about to bring on Dzhabrail Kadayev. And it's a mixed response from the fans here at Teddy Stadium. Most of the Beitar fans are cheering, some are booing. The Beitar fans are going wild! EAST STAND AGAINST RACISM It is another big statement from the management in their justified fight against racism. Kadayev will replace Ofir Kriaf. Shame on you! Shame on you! Here we are The most Racist team in the country! I can't understand why these people is racist. Because he is Jewish people. All their life they've had a problem with that. How can you be racist about somebody else? Kadayev tries his luck. These poor boys, they come to another country only to help us. They try to play football, and they need to eat this shit! Fucking Arab! What is going on with Kadayev? I see that he is getting into a fight with the fans. If I'm not mistaken they are Maccabi Tel-Aviv fans. He didn't touch the ball and he gets a red card! And he's doing all these things in front of his mother! He is just a 19-year-old kid in the middle of this mayhem. I've been a fan of Beitar for 30 years, I sit in the east stand. It's my life! It's true, there are 3,000 fans who completely hate Arabs and don't want them at Beitar. The large majority are not racist though, people like you and me. What are you doing? I'm following the news and watching you. We were watching your interview on Israeli TV. They were speaking the Israeli language, but anyway... -I think it's still pretty obvious. -Yeah, it's clear. I watched and cried. Three thousand fans in the stadium who are all only against me, shouting crazy insults and how they never want to see me at the club again. And my father, with tears in his eyes, told me he wants me to meet with them and end this. So I told him "You know what? I'll go." We met at the house of one of the people from La Familia, all the organization leaders were there, who are in charge of all the swearing. Each one has a responsibility, like in certain sort of organizations. They asked me to join them and speak out against the club. But if a player does such a thing, he wouldn't play for the club anymore. A football player should not go through such things. As loud as you can, we are in front of his home. Loud! We don't want Itzik at Teddy! I played for 12 years, hundreds of games, the fans lifted me over and over again. On the upside, their support can propel you to the sky. The captain, the leader, the symbol of Beitar Jerusalem! Itzik Korenfine! Two weeks ago, I was listed as a protection priority. It is a category only used for government ministers, not even for members of parliament. Two bomb disposal officers came over, told me to check under my car every morning and showed me what to do. Eti Korenfine! Sons of bitches! My voice is louder than all of you? Eti Korenfine! We wanted you to know That the next cock you get is mine! People stood two meters away from me and told me, "We will come over and rape your daughter." They said it to my face. Eti is a whore! We are a violent society. The things you see in the east stand are a very concentrated and amplified version of a behavior that exists in our society. Both the verbal violence and the physical one. It is present in our society, but in football there is much more. POWER TO BIBI Go for it, Bibi! Beitar was always the bastion of the Likud party. Whoever wanted to get into power would go through Beitar. President Rivlin used to be the chairman of Beitar Jerusalem. And here he is, carried by them, Rubi Rivlin, who has done a whole lot for Beitar Jerusalem. There were people who saw the power of Beitar and its political value. When you are campaigning... ...and there is a huge audience of 15 or 16 thousand, and today almost 29 thousand people, you can meet everyone in one place and kick off your campaign. Do you recognize him? Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu. I came here tonight to say just two words: Go Beitar! I remember sitting in the western stands, with those who later became mayors of Jerusalem, all of them Beitar fans. I kept telling them, "Guys, what goes on in the east stand is not good, and our silence legitimizes them. Enough, comrades, you are the leaders of the flock, of the community, of the government!" Many times they disregarded this, so as not to anger the fans. Death to the Arabs! They think that by shouting "Death to the Arabs", they express their love for the Jewish nation. Unfortunately, many Israeli politicians support that idea to stay in power. Maybe they will not say the words "Death to the Arabs", but they constantly aggravate the situation. War! A usual guest in the Beitar stands, Foreign Affairs Minister Lieberman, the right-most voice in Netanyahu's government. Nobody gets a similar welcome here at Teddy Stadium. It's important. One also needs something for the soul. Not only work. I've been coming for many years. -Undoubtedly, it has helped me connect. -How come? Because Beitar is the hardcore of the national movement, of the right wing. If Beitar wins, the guys would be more enthusiastic, more energetic with their help, especially around election time. "We are here to support you, but Sadayev is out!" Text messages not to let Zaur play. 118 messages. "Everything can change in one second if number 13 comes on to play, the choice is yours!" As usual, the players hope that the Lord in heaven will help them. Sadayev gets the ball, and it's a goal! One Zero to Beitar Jerusalem! And all the Beitar fans are cheering! Even those who booed and cursed Sadayev until now. This is history for Beitar Jerusalem, a Muslim player scores a goal for this club. This is the most important goal for Beitar Jerusalem this season. Lieberman, how can you support them? Where are your opinions, Lieberman? Where? Everything is ruined in a second, you son of a bitch. Beitar fans are abandoning the stadium as we speak. They are protesting the fact that Sadayev scored for Beitar. I do not know of any such phenomenon anywhere in the world. They won't tolerate the fact that Sadayev, a Muslim Chechen, scored a goal for Beitar Jerusalem. And you know what? If this is their reaction, Beitar can live without them. BEITAR FOREVER PURE. They mean Arab-free. That's what they are saying. Irrelevant of your political views or ideology, as a Jew, you cannot use this expression. Because of the past. BEITAR FOREVER PURE. Did you think the reaction to the two players would be so tempestuous? Well, yes, of course. It was obvious. That was the purpose. I don't know if the reaction was that tempestuous, but, of course, the transfer was organized for this reason. What for? It's not because they are good footballers. I have no idea if they're any good. I assumed that there would be a big reaction. Why did you want this? To show this society as it really is, expose its real face. Ariel, let's pray? Shai, would you like to pray? Dasa, would you like to pray? Let's pray now, it's exactly ten minutes. So arrange a Minyan. -Each man can pray for himself. -Tell Avishay. Avishay and I are coming. Zaur will join us too. Zaur! Bring Zaur with you, so we'll have a full quorum. -Wait a sec, Ofir! -Come. Why didn't they give us these hats? Just kidding. Tell him it's a Jewish tradition. Dario is just kidding. You want the Yarmulke? Zaur? He asked why he didn't get one. Blessed be you, Lord, King of the Universe, -who created the fruit of the vine. -Amen! The players of Beitar, the Israelis, don't give a fuck about these players. In the team, the only players who tried to fight against the fans were me and Ariel Harush. The other players did nothing. I have a very good relationship with all the players. Because me, I don't care about religion. So I don't have any problem. Also the players from Croatia, they don't have any problem. Maybe it's because of the religion. This is what I think. This is what I saw in the dressing room. Will you hang one of Zaur and Jabo shirts here? One of their shirts? If they send me one, I'll hang it. See, Thierry Henry sent me one, I got his shirt, and hung it here. If there's a place for Schechter from Hapoel Tel-Aviv, there's no reason to exclude anyone else. Everyone has a place here. Anyone who sends his shirt has a place here. This is why it's called the museum, it's a collection. They are human beings like us, we're all the same. I don't care if someone is Jewish or not, Israeli or not, to me everybody is the same. -What about Meir Harush? -What do you want? The man and the legend. The only asset that stays is Meir Harush. The players change, the owners change, the coaches change. Only the fans and Meir Harush don't change. Maybe after this year, who knows. ABU GHOSH I'm the Mayor of the Abu Gosh village. The population of Abu Gosh is 95 percent Chechens. He says that everybody here is Chechen. Really? Where are all the Chechens? Does it look similar to what you have in Chechnya? The minarets, the gates? Yes, this part looks similar, but the surroundings don't. Is he an Arab? -He asks if you're an Arab. -I'm Chechen. A Chechen? Really? How come? -Everyone here is Chechen. -Why don't you speak Chechen? -He doesn't speak Chechen. -I know. Tell them we're Chechens, but we came here 500 years ago. How do you feel here in Israel? It's okay, we just miss home. It's better I don't say a thing. In the last game, the fans stood up and left the stadium. There are all sorts of people, what can you do about it? They didn't like how I played, so they left. They don't like us, so they left. And I wished them Godspeed. Soon it will be all over, and everything will be fine. You will feel easier, and so will we. The terrorists responsible for the Boston bombing were known to U.S. agencies that monitor terrorists. U.S. authorities will check if it had been possible to prevent the Chechen brothers from obtaining the explosives that caused the death of three men and injured 200. Crazy world. There have already been developments around it. Someone read out loud something from Facebook, connecting it with Beitar. We're the majority! Beitar's army of fans is ready to defend their loved one. This is our moment! We will crush the current management! It begins with a Muslim, then an Arab, then another Arab, and another... Boycott the game! Stay home, and let the chairs cheer! Today we show them how true fans fight till the end! Beitar army, go fight! Good luck, everyone! Go Beitar! -Here, he's filming you. -Let him. What can I do? Good for him. We're here to win today. With or without the fans. We'll beat them for sure! It will be fine, don't worry. You're a kind soul. What? I'm alone here. LOVE OF MY LIFE Good evening. Yes, you are not mistaken, the stands at Teddy Stadium are empty. THE PRICE OF BETRAYAL We heard about a plan to boycott the games. A huge success for La Familia, which shows their true power. A huge loss for the management. It's unbelievable that a few hundreds can sweep away so many thousands. Where are all those who said all these years when Beitar fights racism, when they sign an Arab player... ...we'll be there to support the club. All those who said "we're Beitar fans, we're not racists, we are against La Familia", where are you? It's not fun to be here now! It's not fun. But when are your commitment and values tested? During the hard times. Five minutes! It totally depends on us, it's our home. Two minutes! Go, guys, it's our honor. Good luck, guys. We'll only have around 200 in the stands. So many didn't come? Sadayev... and again there are whistles against him. We are sick of it. They were out of strength, out of passion. It was replaced by a kind of fear. I can't believe Harush failed to block it. Because you could see it coming. We were hugely surprised. We did not know that this phenomenon had spread much beyond this body, the La Familia organization. The crisis is so deep, this team is used to massive support from the fans. Beitar Jerusalem continue to lose since the arrival of the two Chechen players, and finds itself at the bottom of the table, facing a risk of being relegated. The fans are eliminating Beitar Jerusalem in their own hands. -I'm sick of this damn season. -Get up. There's nothing to do, Kobi. This is our misfortune and we are screwed. Today was tough. And now with us, Beitar fan Moshe from La Familia. You said, it's only a few people, it's small. These few people made 15,000 20,000 serious Beitar fans stay away. We are the real Beitar fans! We have the best fans in Israel and we all grew up with the fans. We all did. It's so difficult for a player to perform when his own fans are against him. We play for the fans, after all, we work hard to come give them a show. The power of the team is the fans. They need to understand, we are not against them. We are a part of a club, we are employees. It was a surprise move for both us and them. Out of the blue. It was difficult to accept it. "It's not the same without you!" Not a single moment of peace at Beitar Jerusalem. The young midfielder Ofir Kriaf was suspended after publicly supporting La Familia, defying the chairman's request to support the captain and condemn any display of racism. The fans abandoned us in a kind of protest. I told you, in that I support them one million percent. Because the transfer wasn't meant to help Beitar. It wasn't for the benefit of the club, but for Arcadi Gaydamak. I felt for him, because he was naive. He wasn't being naive at all! He wrote it from the bottom of his heart: "Without you, it's not the same!" And he was right, without the fans, it is really not the same. Remember what your father is telling you. You play first and foremost for yourself, then for the fans, then for the club. But first and foremost, for yourself. Once you, Ofir Kriaf, give everything you've got for Ofir Kriaf, the sky's the limit. We'll fight for you so that you will stay with Beitar for the rest of your life. We know where you grew up, you grew up in the east stand. Who else stayed loyal to us through all? You are our number one player. We found ourselves in a difficult situation. It wasn't like losing a game, knowing that you can work harder and win the next one. Losing became a routine, a disgusting atmosphere in the team, never had such a mood in the locker room. Look at all the kids. Make Kriaf the captain! Make Kriaf the captain! Ofir Kriaf! I care for the fans just as much as Ofir does. I also grew up with these fans, as one of them sitting in the east stand. But Ofir did something that is not done and Itzik was furious with him. But it was also smart, because whoever the fans want, will stay in the team. That's just how it works. Suspected arson in Beitar's offices at the Bait Vagan training ground. Early this morning, firefighters called to the scene put out the fire. The cause of the fire seems to be a Molotov cocktail. So everything's gone? Sure, the whole club. The damage from the smoke is worse than the fire itself. What a stupid criminal. Look at what he's done here. Unbelievable. I hope they catch him. It's Beitar Jerusalem's small museum. It's all our history, all our stuff, our memorabilia. Hi, Itzik. It took us ages to gather all of this, and one day a moron comes and burns everything. Bar-mitzvah kids come here to take photos. The first thing they want to see is this beautiful room. So to go burn down such a room, destroy it? Has he got a heart? Is this a Beitar fan? About the team which I have supported for many years, and my sons are its fans as well, Beitar Jerusalem. It has a dear, fine fan base. I therefore call on all Beitar fans, and those who are not fans as well, to simply denounce these actions. With all respect to the words of the Prime Minister, where was he all this time? The writing has been on the stands for a long time. OUR FOREFATHERS SAID NEVER GIVE UP ON PRINCIPLES BEITAR FOREVER PURE WITHOUT ARABS And all this pressure is on Beitar Jerusalem, ahead of its final round encounter with Bnei Sakhnin, the only Arab team in the league. Both teams are fighting for their survival. We are Beitar Jerusalem, we are talented players, and if a player doesn't believe he's good enough, he will never be good. We need a fresh start, to take only the good things with us. The most important thing is the fighting, the will, the determination. Give it all you've got, tomorrow is about giving it all, because we will not have another chance. Remember that. THROUGH FIRE AND WATER WITH OUR HOLY FATHER Tension is rising before the match at Sakhnin against Beitar Jerusalem, in a game for survival. Now with us on the line, Moshe from La Familia. This is going to be a war. For them, the Jews are the enemy, and for us, the Arabs are the enemy. Last night, we had a small meeting and we decided to go to Sakhnin. For 90 minutes, we will do all we can to keep the team in the league, but when the game ends, we'll continue our protest. To die or conquer the mountain Is it like a local derby? He asks if it's like a derby for you. It's much more important. -They say it's much worse. -Yes? Because they are Arabs? He asks if it's because they are Arabs. Not only. Tell him it's a home game for him. Beitar fans They are all sick With swine flu They should die young These are huge flags for tonight. The whole Arab community is coming tonight, not only Sakhnin. From the south, to the desert, to the center. Everybody! So even when times are hard I'll be shouting your name on the streets Yellow flows through my veins Beitar always and forever If we are relegated tonight, nothing will help us. Beitar will disappear, and we can't let that happen. Guys, it's important to leave here today in a good mood, to be men. The team that wants it harder will win this game. Never forget, it's only a matter of will. -One for all! -All for one! Victory! Go, Beitar! Harush, you're a son of a bitch! We shall sacrifice our soul and blood for you, Al-Aqsa! We shall sacrifice our soul and blood for you, O Al-Aqsa! Death to the Arabs! Death to the Arabs! A red card for Sadayev! Beitar remains with ten players! Now, Harush must keep a clean sheet, or else Beitar will be relegated. A great save by Harush! Game over. Final score is nil-nil, Beitar saved from relegation in the last minute. Harush, you're a son of a bitch! Ofir Kriaf! I can't remember a season like this in the history of Beitar Jerusalem. Where is the car? Jabo wrote a song already, "There is no place like home". So it's goodbye? Goodbye... forever! Home! Guys, I wish you all the best. -May you stay together for many years. -Amen. Enjoy playing football and don't worry about a thing. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. This season, we have been run over by everything except a train. That means, next year we will be champions. It is clear we failed. Our move was a total failure. Because we underestimated the level of aggression this move would provoke. It holds up a mirror, and shows us where our club really stands. Looking into the future, there will either be an Arab playing at Beitar, or there will be no Beitar. That's how it is. I gave away Beitar for free. I'm very happy to be out of that club, without losing too much. It's a huge relief not to be the owner of Beitar. Here we are The most racist team in the country! We don't want Harush at Teddy! We don't want Harush at Teddy! Harush is dead! Ariel Harush is a traitor! Traitor! Who's the king? Ofir Kriaf! Ofir Kriaf! Even in the hardest times I'll shout your name in the streets Yellow flows through my veins Beitar always and forever Translated by: Nimrod Hershberg
