(upbeat music) (ominous music) - Last one. - Thank you, Jessica. - All right, have a good night. - You too. (door closing) - [Speaker] Jessica. Help me. - Hello? We're closed. (speaker speaking faintly) (soft music) - Boo. (Jessica screams) Priceless. You should have seen your face. I knew I could scare you. - Autumn, you jerk. Dude, I hate you so much. - You can't hate me that much. I bought you an amazing burger and fries just like you asked. Tell me I'm the best older sister ever. - You're the best older sister ever. Oh, are we still going to Amanda's party later? - Hell, yeah. Look at me, I'm so ready. I'm so hot right now. - Okay - But fair warning, her parties really aren't that great. - Aren't that great? - Yeah. - Autumn, Amanda is super cool and this is the first party she's ever invited me to, okay? This is big for a freshman like me. Please don't kill it for me. - I won't. - Aren't you cold? It's freezing outside. - I am, but it's okay. The party's inside and plus we wanna look good. By the way, I have a change of clothes for you in the car and I also brought your contacts. - I'm gonna call Amanda and let her know that we're on our way. - All right. Oh shoot. I left my phone inside. Here, grab this. I'll be back. Where did I leave you? (phone ringing) Hello? - [Santa Slayer] Do you wanna die tonight? - Autumn, you already scared me once tonight. It's not gonna happen again. I'll see you in a minute. - [Santa Slayer] Don't hang up. (ominous music) That's weird. (phone ringing) Autumn, where did you go? - [Santa Slayer] The morgue. - Seriously, Autumn. Stop messing around, dude. It's freezing outside and I'm ready to go. - [Speaker] That's funny. Because she wasn't. - Autumn, stop messing around. - [Santa Slayer] It's not Autumn. - Fine. Then who is it? - The person who ripped her intestines out. (ominous music) - What? - [Santa Slayer] You heard me. Open the back door. See for yourself. (ominous music) (Jessica screams) - [Jessica] Autumn! - Twice in one night. That's like a new record. I can't believe you fell for that. - I'm gonna kill you. I swear. (ominous music) (Autumn screaming) Okay. Autumn, this is kind of overkill, don't you think? Autumn, stop.

So how's your video going for the Winter Wonderland Dance? - Pretty good. I'm almost done with it. Hey, congrats on the article by the way. I can't wait to read it. - Thanks. It's so exciting. Can you believe it? I finally beat Amanda Lawton at something and I'm finally getting something on the front page. - This just happened and you were able to get it printed. How did you even get the story? - My daddy, the chief of police told me, Elise, that's how I got the inside scoop. Did you see how many likes it got on Instagram and Facebook? It's insane. I just hope that Minka doesn't feel bad that it moved her article off the front page. - Hey, we need to go finish that extra credit for biology. - I'll see you later. - Okay. Laters. (ominous music) - Principal Lucas? - Yes? - Chief Lawton is here to see you. - Oh, let him in please. - Thank you. - How we doing chief? - I've seen better mornings. Take a look at this. - You want me to believe that someone in our school is the reborn Santa Slayer? - Take a look. I know it sounds crazy. Both victims attended school here. - That's correct. - Lucas, I want every student in this school questioned just to be safe. - Okay, Chief, you got it. - Let's get started. (soft music) - Morning, Mr. Campbell. - Hey. - Minka, what's with the long face? - Amanda and her dumb article. - Don't worry about it. - So are you ready for a pop quiz? - Totally. - What? - Sike, I love to see your reaction. Especially hers. Respect the study. - Respect the study. - You heard what happened to Jessica and Autumn? - Yeah, it was horrible. I heard one of the girls' fingers got cut off. - Anyway, so I was thinking that like when we were planning it, we should just like... Elise? Trent? - Amanda, baby. It's not what it looks like. It's... - No, don't talk to me. - Amanda, wait. - You better not forget our birthday cupcake tradition. - I messed up one time and you never let it down. - Well, why should I? You gave my cupcake to a certain girl that you are madly in love with when she was sick. You know, Amanda Lawton. You better not let me down two years in a row now. - Keep talking to me like that and I might just give you a cupcake again. - That's totally not cool. (bell ringing) - Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. - [Students] Good morning. - What do you respect? - [Students] The study. - Excellent. Are you all ready for the last week of the semester? - [Students] Yes. - Good morning students. This is Principal Lucas. As we all know, over the weekend, our student body suffered a tragic event with the loss of Jessica and Autumn Maroni. Now, the police will be on campus all week and they will be questioning you students. And as the holidays approach, I want you to keep kindness in your hearts and stay close to those that love you. I return you now to your scheduled classes, thank you. - I know recent events has made things difficult, but we must move on. So today we will be discussing Edgar Allan Poe's "The Pit And The Pendulum" Afterwards, we'll have a few verbal presentations. So everybody get into groups. - So what did you think about "The Pit And The Pendulum?" - Oh, I loved it. I thought it was just really good and suspenseful, you know. Just imagine being captured like that. It scares the bejesus out of me. - Yeah, me too. So I got two tickets for Cool Guy Five at Limelight tomorrow. - My God, I love that band. - I was wondering if you wanted to go to the concert with me. - Like a date? I would love to go, Jeremy. I think it'd be a lot of fun. (door bell ringing) (soft music) (paper rustling) (soft music) (Prudence screaming) (bell ringing) - So you were friends with them? - Yes, sir. Well, Autumn more than Jessica, but yes. Really horrible what happened to them. I wrote an in memorial about them in the school paper. - I saw that. Thank you, Miss Lawton. - You're welcome, sir. Oh, by the way, I started a GoFundMe page for their family just for the hard time they're going through. It's the least I could do. - Thank you, Miss Lawton. - Hey. - Hey. - See you around. - You raised a good daughter there, Chief. - Thank you, sir. - Good morning, Principal Lucas, Officer Lawton. - Good morning. - So Jeremy, did you know Autumn and Jessica Maroni? - No, sir. I only know that Autumn was one of the most popular girls in school and Jessica had a growing following on YouTube with Vintage Records. - Do you ever have any psychological problems? - No. Why do you ask? - It's just a question. (phone ringing) Excuse me. - I think it is the Santa Slayer who sent me that picture and finger. - Look, we don't know that for sure yet. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Jeremy, does he know? - No. And he's not going to find out. - Prudence, you're gonna have to tell him the truth eventually. - No, he won't find out. So you promise me you won't tell him. - All right, I promise. - Thank you. - Hey, Aunt Prudence. You ready to go pick up the car? - I'll call you later. Jeremy. Minka. (soft music) - What was Chief Lawton doing here? - For all your painting needs, call Paint Masters today. (210) 979-0902. - We interrupt this show for a special news report. We are taking strong measures to ensure the safety of everybody in the city. Now are there any questions? - I have a question. - Yes, sir. - Some people are speculating that this is the return of the Santa Slayer, the local serial killer by the name of Charles Jarvis, who murdered a dozen people 18 years ago this very month. What do you have to say about those allegations? - It's not possible. Now Charles Jarvis was put to rest 18 years ago by me. Now, are there any other questions? - You know what would be cool? - Yes, ma'am? - If we could somehow solve these murders. - Getting killed is not my idea of cool. - Think about it. We solve the murder mystery and become the coolest kids in the school. - Or die. I don't know about you, but I'm not a big fan of dying. Even if it is for a good cause. How about you just concentrate on your date with Little Miss Perfect, Amanda Lawton and leave the Nancy Drewing to the police and I'll sweeten the deal for you. I'll let you borrow my car if you leave this alone. - [Lawton] We don't want to give the killer any- - We have a deal? - Deal. - How are you doing? Jeremy, right? - Yeah. Just finished this video for the school dance. - Yeah, I can see that. Can I watch it? - On Friday. I'm gonna take it to Mr. Campbell right now. - You good? You seem nervous. - I kind of am. You never talk to me and when you do, you call me a nerd, a dork or a punk. - Yeah, what can I say? There's always time for change. Look, the reason I'm here is I know you're going out with Amanda Lawton tonight. All I can say is congrats. She's a grade A girl. - I'm supposed to believe this? - Of course. I don't lie especially to new friends. - New friends? - Yeah, in fact, do me the solid, come down to my place after tonight's concert. My parents are out of town for the weekend. I'm throwing this post-concert party and anybody that is anybody will be there. - You serious? - Yeah, as serious as a heart attack. - Okay. I'll talk to Amanda about it. I already did. She's in. So come on, it'll be fun. This is where you shake my hand. It's not gonna shake itself. There we go, all right. See around, Jeremy. - Strong grip. - So you're really going out with Jeremy Adams after school today? - Of course. I'm actually kinda looking forward to it. I think it's gonna be a fun concert. - I guess he's kind of cute. What concert is it? - Cool Guy Five. - Amanda, can we talk? - Leave me alone. - Okay, your jealousy is really starting to irritate me. - My jealousy? I'm sorry, do you not have any idea what the definition of committed relationship is? I know those are two very big words for you. - Okay, there is no need to be condescending. - Three big words for you. Let's go. - You're messing with your reputation here, Amanda. You blow me off, you and your little friend here are gonna have a horrible end of your senior year. What the hell? - Let's get one thing straight. You can insult me, but don't insult my friends. Second of all, I made the social food chain here, not you. The only reason you're cool is because I dated you when you came here as a sophomore. I made you who you are. Don't forget that. (soft music) (girls chattering) - Maybe you should get some contacts. It might help you look better, dork. - Didn't I have a talk with you about bullying your classmates? As punishment, you're going to have detention with me and you're going to clean up that snack bar. (soft music) - Hey, don't worry about Elise, you look great. - Thanks. - No problem. - Trent invited me to go over to his house tonight with Amanda after the concert, some post concert party. - Jealous ex-boyfriend with an ex-girlfriend. Sounds like the perfect first date. - See you later tonight. - So where are you going to take Amanda to dinner? - They have a pretty good taco truck next to Limelight. - I'm pretty sure the Limelight taco truck is not Amanda's idea of the perfect first date. - Last time I checked, you loved that taco truck. - Yeah, but impress her a bit. Take her somewhere nice. Have fun on your date. And don't forget, tomorrow's my birthday. I'm expecting a cupcake. - I'll let you know what Amanda thinks of your cupcake. - I hate you. - Friends forever? - The best. (soft music) (car door closing) (ominous music) - Do people not know how to clean up after themselves? Gross. (soft music) - I've already locked up. Once you're done cleaning the tables, I'll then let you leave. You missed a spot. (Coach Prescott gurgling) - Coach Prescott? (Coach Prescott screaming) (Elise screaming) (footsteps pattering) - Amanda! - I wouldn't move closer to her if I were you, Elise. Unless you both wanna die. - Who are you and what do you want? - I just want two friends to have some fun together by playing a little game called the Elise or Amanda Get Gut. - I'm not playing. - You don't have a choice unless you wanna make like a chainsaw and split. (Elise screams) You run, I'll find you and run this chainsaw right up your ass and split you in two. We are playing. - What are the rules? Trivia. Horror film trivia. (upbeat music) You're playing to live. Understand? Good. First question will be easy, and a giveaway. Who is the killer in "Friday The 13th?" (ominous music) - Pamela Voorhees. - Excellent. Time for the second question. Amanda, you're up. - Wait, I thought it was playing for both of our lives? - Thought wrong, bitch. Amanda, your question. What are the names of the four Cenobites in first two "Hellraiser" films? - Pinhead, the Female, Butterball. - Right. So close, one more. - Come on, Amanda. I showed you this movie. - I don't know. - [Santa Slayer] Five, four, three, two, one. - The Shouter. (gun firing) - Incorrect. - What the hell? - She answered incorrectly. Why did you shoot me? - I'm sorry. Did that hurt? Did I forget to say you're playing for the other person's life? - That's not fair. - You're locked in a girl's locker room playing for your life and you just now decide that it's not fair? Aren't you the bright one? So much for having a brain. Now get up. We're not done yet. (ominous music) (Elise sobbing) Now Elise, what famous book and dagger was seen in "Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday?" - I don't know. - Come on, Elise. Lives are at stake here. I'll give you a countdown. Five, four, three, two, one. - I don't know. (gun firing) (both screaming) - What the hell? She- I thought we were playing for each other's lives. - I changed the rules because of your complaining and now you want them back? - That's it. I'm not playing anymore. - What are you gonna do? Run? (laughs) That's the only exit and the door is locked. (Elise sobbing) (Santa Slayer laughing) (chainsaw snarling) (blender whirring) (soft music) - Hey, I thought you had a date tonight. - Amanda didn't show. You were right, Minka. Why would she date somebody like me? - Don't say that, Jeremy. You're a nice guy. Plenty of girls would love to be with you. Trust me. I know. - Thanks. - You know what, we're going out tonight. Best friend date. - What? - You heard me. Best friend date. That is, if you don't mind hanging out with your best friend for a couple of hours. - Okay. Sure. ♪ But now we lie awake ♪ - Have you ever seen this movie before? - No. Why? - Well, the ending is special. - What does that mean? - You're just gonna have to experience it for yourself. I can't tell you. (gun firing) - This one is really fun. Okay, you ready? - Yeah. Go. - Okay. Look, there you go! (controllers beeping) (both laughing) - Nice. - This one. Why not? Okay, it's working. (booth rattling) Come on. It's right there! Come on! - Yeah, let's do this one. - Okay. - You wanna try it? - No, you try it. (both chattering) You're welcome. That's good. I win. It's five to one, but I win. - Okay. - Yeah. That's how the game works. - You're not wearing your bracelet? - Oh, don't remind me. I took it off before PE class and after class it wasn't there. - Don't worry. It'll show up somewhere. I like spending time with you. - You do, huh? - Yeah. I'm lucky to have someone like you in my life. Makes all the messed up things worthwhile. No parents, stood up on a date. - Yeah. Well, same here. You're my best friend and I'd do anything for you. You, my dad and school are pretty much all I care about. - Wow. I'm on the top of that list? - Don't get cocky. But yeah. I'd do anything for you. (upbeat music) ♪ Hiding in the dark from the light till the sun goes down ♪ ♪ We made mistakes, keepsakes, do you remember now ♪ - I'm sorry, I can't do this. You like Amanda and I can't just be some rebound. I- I'll just- I'll just take you home. (upbeat music) - What? Where's Amanda? - Amanda Lawton not in class? Strange. That girl shows up when she's sick. - Here you go, Principal Lucas, for your morning announcements. - Thank you very much. Oh, good morning, students. This is Principal Lucas and I just wanna let you know, due to the tragic circumstances that have plagued our campus recently, the faculty and I have decided to suspend all of the finals until after the winter break. (students cheering) - Let's go home. - Classes will continue as usual throughout this week, and we would like to let you know if anybody needs counseling during these difficult times, please contact any member of the faculty. I wanna let you know that we are here for you and we hope you have a lovely holiday. We'll see you soon. God bless. (bell ringing) - Minka, wait! Can we talk? (students chattering) (car engine roaring) - What the hell did you do to Amanda? - What? - Look, it's one thing to not show up to my party, but it's another kidnap Amanda. - Kidnap? I have no idea what you're talking about, okay? She stood me up. - Look, she wasn't in class today, and you were the last person that saw her when you took her out. She should be here. She's had perfect attendance since kindergarten. - Mr. Billington, let him go. - You got lucky this time, butt-head. Mr. Campbell won't always be here to save your skin. - There's two things wrong with that. One, you threatened a student in front of the teacher and the other, you're bouncing him off my car. So why don't you and the Hardy Boys kick rocks? You okay? - Yes, sir. Thank you. - Good. Call me if you need any help. (soft music) (phone ringing) (ominous music) - What do you want Amanda? - [Santa Slayer] Not Amanda. - Who is this? - [Santa Slayer] Not so fast, Jeremy. Can't give away the big reveal like that. - You're him? The Santa Slayer? - [Santa Slayer] Very good. - Where is Amanda? - [Santa Slayer] Don't worry. She's fine. - [Amanda] Jeremy, I'm at- - Shut up. - Amanda. - [Santa Slayer] Now for what I want. I want to revisit the past. You're past. - What? - [Santa Slayer] Oh, you still don't know your past. The secrets kept from you. You know, about your dead parents. Why won't you ask your aunt when she gets home from work? In the meantime, look at your text messages. I'll be in touch. - Go ask Chief Lawton if you can look in his trash can. Smiley face. - Damn it. He's got my daughter. What else did he say? - He said he wants to revisit my past. And Amanda's article said that you were the one that killed him 18 years ago. Why does he wanna revisit my past and my parents? - I don't know. - Take a look in your trash can. - Why? (ominous music) - I don't know where Amanda is, but I'll help as much as I can. - Thanks, Jeremy. But leave that to us. We're already starting to develop a body count. - He's right. - Hello? Yes. Hey Chief, you got a phone call. - I'll be right back. - It's the coroner. - It's Lawton. What'd you find? - A bracelet? All right, I'll be right there. - What do you think? - I got a lead. Jeremy, you're free to go. We have a lead. A silver bracelet was found under Elise's body. They're checking it for prints right now. We should know who it is pretty soon. - [Romero] Great. - The idiot dropped the bracelet in the trash can. Will you give Jeremy a ride and I'll call you when we make a move on the suspect? - [Romero] Yes, sir. - How did my parents die? (soft music) - A car crash. Remember? - What if I don't believe you? (phone ringing) - It's Lawton. (soft music) The bracelet is a positive on Minka Romero? - 18 years ago, the Santa Slayer killed a dozen people in this city, including your mother. You were a miracle child. You were the only light that came out of this whole massacre. You were born after she was murdered. A coffin birth. Days later, they realized that Charles Jarvis, your father, was the Santa Slayer. Chief Lawton killed him, but I took you and we moved far away. I changed your name. I changed mine. And four years later, I started getting these threatening calls that said, if we didn't come back here, you would be killed. So we came back and everything stopped. Until this year. I'm sorry. I did everything. Everything to protect you. (soft music) - This is why you don't celebrate Christmas? - I'm sorry. (siren blaring) - Minka. I gotta go. (upbeat music) (car engine roaring) - They're coming to get you, Barbara. - [Barbara] Stop it. You're ignorant. - [Speaker] They're coming for you, Barbara. - [Barbara] Stop it. You're acting like a child. - [Speaker] They're coming for you. Look, they're gonna- (window sliding) - Jeremy, stop. Go away. It's late and I don't want to. - We need to go. Now. - What? What are you talking about? Who's that? (ominous music) Jeremy? Who is that? - It's the police. - What? What do they want. - To arrest you. They think you're the Santa Slayer. - Jeremy, I can't be. - They found evidence with Elise's dead body that it was you. - Elise is dead? - Yeah, your bracelet was with her body. With your prints. - Jeremy, you have to believe me. - I do. This guy is targeting the both of us and I need your help to take him down. I can't do this without you. Come with me. (soft music) - Friends for life? - The best. Come on. (soft music) (ominous music) (phone ringing) Hello, Dad. - Dad? - [Santa Slayer] Hello, son. I'm glad your aunt had the guts to tell you the truth. Let's meet. A little family reunion. I just sent you the coordinates to my lair. If you're not there in an hour, your Aunt Prudence dies. - An hour? - I think I have someone who can help. (ominous music) Thanks for the help, Mr. Campbell. (ominous music) - This is where the Santa Slayer brought his victims about 18 years ago. My students talked about it all the time. - An old knife. (door creaking) (soft music) - It's Coach Prescott. - She's been dead for days. - My father's tombstone. (soft music) (Santa Slayer laughs) What do you want? - For you to fulfill your destiny, your legacy. The legacy of your father. Join me. - Father? - Long story. - And if I refuse? - You and your friends won't leave here alive and Amanda will die as well. Make your choice. - Jeremy. - Go to hell. - Wrong answer. (blade slashing) (fist thudding) - Go. (gun firing) Hide over there. (upbeat music) (ominous music) (Santa Slayer laughs) (phone ringing) - Hello? Two teenagers and an older gentleman entering, 1428 Elm. Isn't that the Slayer's house? - Come on now. (ominous music) (gun firing) (fist thudding) - Mr. Campbell! - Mr. Campbell! - Get to my car! (footsteps pattering) (Santa Slayer laughs) (Mr Campbell screams) - We need to go back to Mr. Campbell. He wouldn't leave us. - Didn't you get away lucky. Sometimes you just need to get up-close and personal. - You gonna do it, you better make it count. (siren blaring) (Santa Slayer laughing) - You're right. Come on. - Sir, are you okay? - Mr. Campbell. Mr. Campbell, are you okay? Both of you, stay right there. Don't move. (phone ringing) - Well, this hasn't been the best birthday. - You're telling me. - I am so sorry for everything I put you through. - Minka, stop. It's gonna work out, trust me. - (clears throat) All right, you two. Break it up. I want you both in here. All right, let's go. - The Santa Slayer, my father Charles Jarvis is still alive and out there. - You have no proof. And as far as I'm concerned, the two of you are the killers. - You have to believe us. He's back. - Chief, you got a phone call. - Can't this wait? - It's him. - Hello. - [Santa Slayer] Hello, Lawton, looking for me? - What do you want? - Revenge. Let's go for Friday night. The 18th anniversary of the supposed end of the Santa Slayer. And let's make this interesting, at the school dance. No more bodies until then. We have a deal? - We have a deal. - [Santa Slayer] Glad to see that my son has more balls than you. If it's canceled, your daughter dies. So you better make damn sure it's still a go. I'll be in touch. - [Operator] If you'd like to call, please- - Minka, you can pick up your bracelet at the front desk. - I guess we have a dance to get ready for. (bell ringing) We're sorry about what happened last night, Mr. Campbell. - Yeah. We should have never gotten you involved. - I have been in far worse situations than that. The most important thing is you two are safe. - Thanks. - Hello, students. This is Principal Lucas. Now due to the recent tragic passing of several students and faculty at Craven High School, I, after much consideration, have decided to cancel this year's Winter Wonderland Dance. - Come on. - Now, I know that this is very disappointing for everyone, but this is in the school's best interest. Furthermore, starting today at the final school bell, we will go into an early release for winter break. Me and the entire faculty agree that it is best for all students and faculty to be with their families during this difficult time. That being said, I wish everyone a good rest of today and have a great winter break. I'll see you all next semester. (phones vibrating) - There's a party at Trent's tonight. - So cool. - That's awesome. - Best way to start off winter break. - May I remind your students that phones are to be turned off during class time? (bell ringing) - Do you have any idea how insensitive that was? And you realize, of course, that three of your classmates and a faculty member have been slaughtered beyond recognition? So what do you do? You decided to throw yourself a little Christmas party. - Sorry, I didn't realize throwing a Christmas party to celebrate the end of the semester was against school policy. - Very clever, Billington. You probably think because you're the star quarterback of the football team here at this school and you're getting a free pass next fall for college. Guess what, buddy, every minute you're here under my roof, in my school, you will behave and you will do as you're told. Am I making myself clear? - Or you're gonna assign me more homework, correct? - You better watch your mouth, Mr. Pretty Boy Piece Of Shit. You're gonna do exactly what I tell you to do. - Mr. Lucas. - What? - Chief Lawton is here to see you. - I can't eat. I can't sleep. I'm sick. Lucas, help me. You know I can get this guy. Keep the dance on. - There is nothing I can do. I'm doing this to protect our students and our faculty. There's already been too many fatalities. - My daughter's life is on the line here. - Chief, I know that. Believe me, I do. I have to think of more than just one daughter in my school. I'm sorry. (soft music) That will be all. (soft music) Chief. Whatever you have to do. (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Santa Slayer] Well, aren't you just having a wonderful day? What did I tell you about making sure that dance isn't canceled? I couldn't help it. I tried. - [Santa Slayer] Now you're going to have to face the consequences. - Don't you hurt her. Look, I'll do whatever you want. - [Santa Slayer] I'm feeling a little compassionate right now. Bring Jeremy to me, right now, to the address I'm about to text you. If not, your daughter dies. (ominous music) - This ends now. - [Santa Slayer] So I can assume you didn't bring the boy. - You would be correct in your assumption. - [Santa Slayer] You disappoint me. Why would you come without the boy? - Because I came here to kill you. - [Santa Slayer] And I thought you came here to die. You better be careful. You don't know what might happen to Amanda. - You son of a bitch. - [Santa Slayer] You should be nicer to the guy who is holding your daughter captive or I might just get a little frisky with her just like I did with your diseased wife. Remember her bloody carcass 18 years ago? The person you failed to protect? (Santa Slayer laughing) (gun firing) - Merry Christmas, asshole. She's not here. (ominous music) - Surprise, Daddy. - Amanda. - Bullet proof vest. I'm sorry daddy. But your daughter's got a story to finish and it's gonna be totally fetch. - I loved you. (knife slashing) (Lawton groaning) (ominous music) - [Speaker] Help me. Help me. Mr Campbell. Mr Campbell, come out here. (ominous music) (ornament clattering) (ominous music) Help me. Help me. - Kids. (people chattering) Cute! Olly olly oxen free, free, free. (ominous music) (Santa Slayer laughing) Principal Lucas, I say goodnight, Merry Christmas and a happy New Year. Skull! - Cheers, my friend. - Later. (footsteps pattering) - [Speaker] Principal Lucas. Principal Lucas. (speaker chuckling) Principal Lucas. I need some help. I need some help. - Hello. Campbell. (ominous music) Is that a camera? (Lucas groaning) - Guess we get to have our cupcakes after all. Happy birthday, Minka. - Happy birthday, Jeremy. - Make a wish. (phone ringing) Hello. - [Santa Slayer] Hello, Jeremy. Ready for the final act? What better way for this to end than at a house party? Trent's Christmas party. If you bring any cops, everyone at that party will die. Come to the party or Amanda is dead. Also, come dressed to impress. (ominous music) - We need to get to that party, clear our names, and save Amanda. - Right. Let's go. (upbeat music) (people chattering) - Come on. (people chattering) (upbeat music) (phone ringing) Hello. - [Santa Slayer] Hello, Jeremy. - Where are you? - [Santa Slayer] Relax. The big reveal is coming. You just have to wait a little bit longer. (Trent groans) - Excuse me, everybody. Is everyone having a nice night? (audience cheering) As we all know, in the last Friday before school lets out for Christmas break, Craven High School has a Winter Wonderland Dance. Unfortunately, it was canceled this year. (crowd booing) I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But, don't fear, we are carrying on the Winter Wonderland tradition. Every year, a senior gets the opportunity to create a Christmas short. And the honor this year goes to Jeremy Adams. (audience applauding) - Jeremy, what's going on? - I don't know. - I got sent this video right before the party and it's never been viewed. Consider this a world premiere. Hit it. (upbeat music) - This isn't my film. - What? (phones ringing) (ominous music) - [Student] Oh my God. What? (ominous music) (Lucas groaning) (ominous music) (audience screaming) - What the hell is this? Turn it off. (audience screaming) Jeremy! He's the one that made this snuff film. Get him. - Run. (audience screaming) - My phone isn't working. - Neither is mine. - Come on. (footsteps pattering) (people screaming) - Keep going. I'll hold him here. (ominous music) (fists thudding) - Go get the girl. (ominous music) (footsteps pattering) (ominous music) - Come out, come out, wherever you are. (ominous music) (Trent chuckles) Lookie what we have here. (Santa Slayer laughing) This is gonna be fun. - You're right about that (laughs). (Minka screams) (ominous music) (Santa Slayer laughing) - Come on, let's go. (ominous music) - Wait, wait. I'm too cool to die! (ominous music) (door slams) - Jeremy. - Amanda. Come on, we gotta go. The Santa Slayer is here. - I know. Thank you for saving me. - Let's go. Let's get the police. - Okay. (door creaking) (ominous music) (door slams) - Trent? - Surprise. (fist thudding) Everybody is gone from the party. It's only amount of time before the police come. So, let's wrap this up. - You two had a fight. You broke up. I asked you out and you said yes. - Oh, come on. You really think I'd go out with a nerd like you. This is not some John Hughes teen comedy where the geek gets the girl, okay? Although I am surprised that you had the balls to ask me out. Truth is, if you hadn't have asked me out, I would've asked you out. I bet you're wondering why? It's simple. To be famous. Live a glorious life. Because let's face it, to be famous, a social media personality, whatever, you don't need to do anything important. Just post bikini pictures, pass out water bottles like a celebrity whore at an award ceremony, or strap a dildo to your backpack and you've bought yourself a ticket. So I thought, Amanda, why not kick it up a notch? Make a story about it. Bring back to life our city's notorious serial killer for a new generation and start murdering people. Survive the killing spree with my ex-boyfriend and stage my kidnapping to prove my innocence. - You would kill all of your friends? - Friends? Gotta kill the competition. It was all for the greater good. I mean, the greater me. Oh and yes, I killed my own father. The authorities will discover his body soon, and I'll just have to fake cry myself out of that one too. (Amanda chuckles) - How do we tie into all this? - You're the killer, Jeremy, along with your little girlfriend, Minka. It was a long project in the making. Tons of research. Had to hunt down your aunt after she changed her name, sent a couple of nasty letters to convince her to return home. It worked. (Amanda chuckles) After you found out that your father was the original Santa Slayer. It messed up your mind. You went mad trying to live up to your father's sick legacy. And you asked Minka to help you out, because well, she loves you. How could she say no? There was only one problem. You two were arrested, so we had to get you out. Luckily, Mr. Campbell dropped his cell phone and gun in the lair. So he got to be a part of our little drama. - Don't worry, we're gonna pay him a little visit tonight. Kill him, leave the phone with him. You know, co-conspirator. That's the right term. - You're both psycho. - Oh, I know. Sweet but psycho, right? That's how the song goes. - How's this for reporting? - Are you recording? - That is what the big red button means, right? (Jeremy groans) - Run, Minka. - My dad already has the video. (Jeremy thuds) (ominous music) - Come on, Minka. I know you came out here. (ominous music) (blade slashing) (Jeremy thuds) (blade slashing) I just wanna dance. (both groaning) (gun firing) - What about that cupcake I gave you last year when you were sick? Didn't that mean anything to you? - Your cupcake sucked. I threw it up when you left. (ominous music) (Minka groaning) - Die. (Minka choking) (ominous music) - Jeremy, where are you? (fist thudding) You fucking cunt basket. My dad just bought that. (gun firing) (ominous music) - Feliz Navidad. (ominous music) (door creaking) (ominous music) (blade slicing) (Minka groans) - Go to hell, bitch. - Jeremy. - No. (panting) (fists thudding) (ominous music) - Just little kiss of death, nerd. I hope you die a virgin. (gun firing) (gun clanking) (ominous music) (Amanda groans) (ominous music) - No. Minka. Minka. - I love you. - I love you, too. - Best friends for life? - The best.
