Or else I'll make you wear this ring Not to your finger but somewhere else Both are not same!!! It's time to get serious WHERE IS THE RING??? This is about him... You might be wondering why this commotion just for a RING It’s not an ordinary RING There’s a guy who knows the Ring’s backstory... Let’s hear it from him... Before everyone come back from the toilets let me tell you all a story You tell the same to them It's okay!!! Guy named Pentaiah found a glittering stone while mining in a quarry Pentaiah being the loyal person that he is, took the stone to his owner Shankar Shetty. Now, Shankar Shetty being the cunning guy that he is, realised that it's not an ordinay stone, but a diamond Shetty gave Pentaiah couple of bucks to keep him quiet. Next day headlines is that... gems &amp; diamonds are found in Shetty's Quarry His entire fate changed after that Everything turned to 'GOLD' upon his touch I mean 'DIAMOND' His servants learned that 'Shetty's Midas Touch' lies with in that diamond... This reached the newly appointed British Governor Mr. Rutherford Uncle in 1850 He took the diamond from Shetty using force In hunt for promotion, he sent the diamond to Britain Queen on a ship like Titanic detailing the Midas touch nature of the Diamond Ship didn't sink but... it was attacked by the French Army Ship captain had balls in his mouth, literally Captain handed the Diamond to French Army and abandoned the ship for his life I swear this would be last English name in this story ‘King Louis Uncle’ He's a French Boy The Diamond brought immense luck to King Louis But during French revolution, he broke the stone into 107 pieces and distributed them like birthday choclates One of the pieces somehow reached Nizam Uncle Being Gem-O-Phile, he wore it all the time like a ring and named it 'Shaali Shuka Gaja' In short 'SSG' Just like 'RRR' Ring was with Nizam from 1850 to 1948 Nizam grew rich during this phase Indian government performed an operation on Nizam Not a doctor operation, It's an attack Nizam's righthand man, Rayudu Uncle He's a bad person He stole the Ring from Nizam There on, the ring stayed in their family till this generation Though the ring brings immense luck to the owner, there exists a darker side to this Who ever holds the ring It not only brings you the fortune, but also messes with your life As in Fast and Furious, It won’t let you stay still LET'S RUN FOR IT My name is.... It wouldn’t be nice if I brag about myself... What if, my girl friend does this? Sounds GREAT!!! 52, 53, 54... 57, 58, 59.... Sixty... -60- Maaya, I can't go on I'm exhausted!!!

Kittu Wait for me Arjun Why did you come silently? What do you want me to talk? Do you want me to tell that My love is genuine but I am not I behaved senselessly, in order to set my future with Maya I don’t have courage to face her itself, how do expect me to talk to her I did a big mistake, man Though, I had chance to tell her truth, I kept avoiding it everytime Choosing the path to achieve is more important than having a goal Are you avoiding me? How can I avoid you? You and I are not two different people But... You deserve much better You told no one else is greater than you? If that’s the case, It seems you don’t like me, I’ll call dad and tell him to find a nice guy for me Why did you cut the call? You deserve much better means much better me I’ll come for you after I start my restaurant business Then, why do I see it differently here? What do you see? See... I see that we both are married Started restaurant together And stayed happily together It’s you who told me that we’re one for each other Then, why will we have two different goals? What happened? Dammit Arjun Push it now Me? It’ll be like this if you be with me Now push This is the story!!! Now everyone now hold on to your RINGS safely!!!
