Lane acacia savelist Jason wouldn't take it was two bucks to vote in it for him how the boy out there is very much of weight home were unanimous - man hello there my worthy opponent I'm sorry about Tom Cooney I hope he doesn't go to pieces over this he's really got something good this is always you know it's a funny thing about some fellas are unaware your firm everything goes wrong for hiya tom you looking for me I'll be ready in a minute yeah mr. Mara if there's anything I can a little ready cash or something I don't want charity I can change the law I'll do the mayor but I'm not a nursemaid to every man in town who can't take care of alright Tony that's enough now beat it keep your hands too fond of my long bison Oh girls oh this is all my fault I wish you hadn't had to do that funny he said coming to him for a long time our boy is turning into an awful radical you could sell that for the speech he made accept the nomination let's kind of talk is never going to make a miracle boy it's too bad nothing I like better than to see some bright young fella came along who would take my place but bill Adams take a man to feel your she was mr. mayor Darrell dropped in this morning to give us regards what's my bill just a shame is 50 cents a mr. 50 cents not a quarter guess she made a mistake friend no you made the mistake friend you pick the wrong customer that time limit this column ten years every sip the better on me come on in old comment thank you well going stood in boats yeah that's a rather interesting model sees the Columbia a square rigged for master nice work oh and here's a nice one this is a parking team form a square rigged the other mass for an average rather unusual let's sail oh no no no no they're not that good it's only a hobby just just for fun I see you're running for mayor yeah sort of a hobby too just no not quite mayor Coniston you saw him in the barber shop he and his boys been running this town for a long time make it pretty tough for anybody comes up against them yes I get it as much a lot of people been getting tired of it I have much time myself the Army's going to grab me in a couple of months but I thought I might at least get the ball rolling and for once give them a fight but not too much of a fight something you want to see me about mr. granite in the barber shop mr. Adams you mentioned the fact that you might like to make a test case am i fine are you serious yes yes I think you've got a case you do how would you go about it well we lost the law requires a stamp I didn't have one no no but I think I could work out an appeal an appeal on what grounds was the find illegal oh no no they had a right to find you the fact that I was unfamiliar with the law and well that's no excuse obviously obviously then what would you base your appeal on mr. Adams the fact that it's Tuesday and the sun is shining look I haven't had much time to give it thought but I can figure out an angle there must be one lying around somewhat oh yes I'm sure there is in the meanwhile you can always make a living as a carpenter oh yeah bill oh you're busy no Charlie come on in mr. grant Charlie Craig my campaign manager oh you any new votes Charlie enough to fill a dog's ear say I just heard about Tom Cooney yeah he's taking it pretty hard I'm the same kind of note he did so it don't look so good for that tractor mine either you couldn't get me a couple of weeks performance could you I'll try charlie but there's no use of peeling the black stone over the way he's got his business set up his hopping on my tail wouldn't burn me if I hadn't had so much trouble with that tractor every time I needed a spare part I had to send Blackston never carried him in stop did Blackston promise you such service when all there's nothing in the contract about providing service has Blackston lived up to all his legal obligations a seller of the tractor also okay you sound like a lawyer yourself mr. grant yes well I was about 20 years ago well maybe you could give bill here ponder it to anyway I'm glad to met you be seeing you mr. mayor I'm going out and see if I can't educate a few votes for you well mr. grant since you'll have some knowledge of the law you probably decided there's nothing much I can do well what about Craig what are you going to do about him what can I do for it with Hartley on the bench you saw what happened to Tom Cooney you can't blame that on judge Shockley you went into that courtroom without a defense that's why you got whipped well and I guess to get whipped again I guess you will you're not much of a fighter are you mr. except in the barber shop brawls oh stop you can't fight brass knuckles with spitballs the trick in this town is either to play the game their way and I haven't the stomach for that or to be as smart as they are the trick mr. Adams is to be smarter what does that wind up your business are you going to stay and give me the first private lessons and how to win friends and influence judges nor mr. Adams I'm not those lessons have been written and very well written in books like this and all the others and somewhere in one of them there's a lesson mentioning that in any transaction between a seller and a buyer there are laws governing the behavior of both parties but I doubt if you can keep afloat long enough to find it you know mr. Adams I've seen you in action now as a lawyer as a candidate for mayor and as a shipbuilder and if you'll take my advice you will stick to shipbuilding there's a great future in it for lawyers excuse me sir for breaking in like this but I think I found it yes yes that covers it you've said you haven't practiced law for 20 years imagine remembering a thing like that have you had dinner mr. Adams and no thanks not hungry I I think this will cover it it should work but I've been batted down by those guys so often I guess I haven't too much confidence how long have you lived in crown port mr. Adams for 28 years with time out for colleagues in law school never established residents in any other state no you're sure of that well of course or we we went to Mexico for a few months when I was seven but did you file an income tax returns on 1939 and 40 well sure I didn't pay anything in 1940 I didn't earn enough but I filed a return and your figures were honest correct and would their investigation what well of course there were nobody was getting nervous mr. ed I'm not nervous I'm really ah yes yes you are you flustered you're raising your voice why shouldn't I raise my voice you must God has accused me of falsifying my income - I've accused you of nothing mr. Adam now look I don't know what you have on there but I want to tell you this take a look it's the package it's an old trick that Justice Brandeis used to play I read about it in Colliers once you see it's an unfortunate fact mr. Adams that every man even you and I has done something that he doesn't want anybody to know about now you can make him think that you're holding in your hand the skeleton in his closet you've got it well let's say at least you've got him squirming nervous worried as you were but if that man happens to have a really guilty conscience your full name is Vincent Lee Braxton tell me mr. Braxton what does the C stand for do I have to answer that your honor what can be your objects and surely you have nothing to hide well deceive whether C stands for separ except every name that means a little wind I believe mr. Braxton you're the owner and manager of the crown for Taran the sole owner was sure of course no silent partners no well of course the well then you're not the sole owner I didn't say that I just you sound very strange to me mr. Blackman you don't know whether you own your own business and I object that question is irrelevant immaterial and calculated to confuse the witness objection sustained counselor will restrict himself to the facts very on this case mr. Braxton the company sells most of the used cars and tractors in this town almost a monopoly isn't it I do the most business because I sell my that's not monopoly that's that's the American Way of life tell me mr. blacksmith carry spare parts for your customers shipper you have in stock at this moment piston rings for the 1938 tractors you sold in this town well mr. blacksmith well no I don't oh then you don't carry all the spare parts your customers might need well I can always get them if they need them but sometimes your customers have to wait sure it takes two weeks if I ain't got them how can they have them an intelligent engine mr. Braxton and an honest one one which will require the court to enter judgment against you in this case will counselor explain that statement certainly your honor motor vehicle laws nineteen nineteen chapter 174 section 52 the sale of any automobile or any other automotive vehicle is void unless the dealer carries in stock at all times and on demand parts that may be needed to will you let me see that reference counselor would seem to be correct put it over pill hey Chris will take your time coolly do you're telling me oh sorry I thought you were going hunting all the Ducks are inside today I see you winged a couple yourself oh it's nothing really big tell Who am I kidding I'm so tickled I feel like a combination of Superman and a member of the Supreme Court and really I I don't know how to thank you mister girl oh no need to my boy first time I've enjoyed a courtroom in here hej you know what this stuff is no mr. grant he wouldn't William this is good old forward and money you know what you can do with this stuff you can buy things that you need you get it and what I don't get is where you got it 4c and bikes and get tram warm some arts and unloosen a couple of purse strings the boys have kicked in for your campaign fund you know what we're going to do with this beautiful stuff we're going to get some posters printed great big ones they kind of look you're right straight in the eye and call you around why get frightened so Adams does win one rotten little case do you know what that case cost me you can afford it if it had happened to your hotel Rosco you'd scream like a stuck pig stop it stop it seriously Jim you don't see Adams it's whoa staying a Stan now no but if a lot of people start thinking of bill Adams as the people's champion well Jim there was nothing else I could do I can give you boys the edge when it's a question of interpretation but not when the laws like they're in black and white oh I'm not blaming you judges just something to start thinking about that's all you think we'll have trouble well now look boys on second thought we may be getting all steamed up for nothing your head but suppose he opens a lot of old cases like Tom Cooney's I think you've got something there Zephir we'll just have to show the boy that is wrong miss Gilbert No miss Gilbert yeah that's much better Michael Adams mr. grant asked me to meet you yes I know let me take that the cars over here is it you think we should try to scoop some of that up no I guess not huh well everything seems to be under control would it be all right with you if we went to your car now the car oh no no yes right here sorry to get off to such a bad start I'm not always so clumsy don't worry we'll get it how long have you worked for mr. grant tell ya credit characters me quite you know I was very surprised when he told me his secretary was coming down I had an idea the old boy was retired the old where is he now Matt Adams he went over to well bridge this morning do some hunting he oughta be back soon what's going to drive you around the town but I guess you want to get cleaned up now yes I think I will I'll take you straight to the hotel you are learning some manner mm-hmm surprised that's putting it very mildly Adam won't make the most of it lady because that's likely to be the only surprise you'll get the stuff who's the girl with atoms don't know what difference does it make I'd like a room please buy the day no baggage which is yeah I don't register women without baggage in my hotel Henry show this lady out what you don't understand yes I do why you please and I am honest - beat it take your hands off her oh yes I tell you you can't do this look facts my face mister of an officer hej officer hej sergeant sergeant I want to use that phone will you please keep quiet your honor just trying to get us out of here you know why don't you think of that before you look I'm very sorry this happened but it isn't my fault I suppose I started the mmm you sure did all right once it got going oh what a gal and what a wallop yeah miss gee you're really some scrapper say Rosco suede asked me to call you a judge we've got bill Adams in here with a dame salt and battery how long do you want us to hold him here oh just let them stew for a while sergeant Adams will probably want to get in touch with me and oh he does huh well I'm out of town you can't reach me anywhere that's right overnight when you have a chef prepare a couple of these for tomorrow night's dinner and I'll have my key please what what room did you put miss Gilbert him Gilbert there's no miss carpet-ready - well anything wrong mr. grant why yes I was expecting my secretary today mr.
