Our Cuba. What are you doing? Working! What? Working! Working! All the time! -But what are you doing? - Working! We are small but powerful... in body, heart and soul. Here we are, ready for anything, strong and erect... small but marvelous. The Golden Island... We are the top. Cuba is the beauty for the whole world. True? Something... utopian, right? What does "utopia" mean? The exact meaning... I don't know. It's Cuba. Children! Children! Nobody loves me! Capitolio is here. Revolution square is there. "To combat, warriors! Do not fear a glorious death, for to die for the homeland is life. To live in shackles is to live... mired in shame and disgrace. Now hear the sound of the trumpet. Quickly, ye brave ones! To arms!" As the genius Fidel said, the Cuban people will never allow their country to be the colony of any empire again! What is "imperialism"? Imperialism is... what the Spaniards did... They wanted to attack Cuba to destroy it. The Spaniards captured the Blacks and enslaved them. Some could keep their children, but others were sold and separated. Just like they would sell them to you... They'd order them to carry rocks... If one didn't obey, they would do this.... Yes. They beat them. Because it seems they didn't want... - They were racists. - Hate! Racists who hated Blacks. They didn't want... ... blacks to exist in the world. They wanted no one except ... ... white people, only ... We are all human beings and need to be treated as humans. Respected. No one should be treated as if they were trash. Because black just like white means being a person. Then... some people came and said: "Do not hurt the slaves. They are poor. Let them live!" And they fought for peace and revolution. Exactly... and finally we gained freedom. We are in 1898 Our forefathers... invented this marvelous machine, changing humanity forever. Cinema projects our soul. Cinema moves humans... ...to emotion. Seeing comedy makes us laugh. Seeing danger makes us run. In cinema, humanity... ...foresees its future. They land on the moon. It is our planet seen from afar! Here we see images of war! An execution by the Spaniards against poor, little Cubans. The island was at war for years, struggling for independence against the Spanish tyrants. The powerful battleships of the United States! Brave sailors following all the liberators of their time. Remember the "Maine" The dead of the "Maine" shook up the American nation. Cinema became a tool. Waking the fury of citizens in North America, when they saw these images... ...they called their nation to war! Real, documentary cinema images brought reality to people's minds and motivated humanity to go to war. Theodore Roosevelt and his "Rough Riders", cowboys who conquered the West, fighters for independence, against slavery! And for freedom! The United States show their brotherhood with the Cubans, inspired always by the values of liberation. Let us finish off Spaniards! And the flag of tyranny goes down forever but instead up rose... ...the banner of freedom. That is a lie! All lies. It can't be true! An empire wants to dominate other places and countries. As they would like to control us Cubans... But Cuba will never be controlled. What is the name of the film? The one we are making? It's called: "El Epicentro". Look, we are making a film... ...about foreign interference and slavery, and about people in the street. And a man has explained to us... about the explosion of the "Maine" that it wasn't real, It was fabricated in a bathtub. The battleship "U.S.S. Maine". Come in, gentlemen! Everything went according to plan Mr. Roosevelt! You did an excellent job! The naval blockade of Cuba has begun, Sir. Clear. We will attack here, and then we occupy Havana! "Teddy Roosevelt, future president of America" needs the press to help and for protection. He had hair like this. Here they call it a "German hairstyle". A moustache like this... I had the image of Roosevelt as a tough guy, and as I was doing research for the film, I began to find out more... He created an image for himself. The whole image of the "Rough Riders"... was a copy of Buffalo Bill and his circus show. An image of the conquest of the U.S. West. It was all fake! It's just a tale, showing Cuba as a child, and Americans coming on horses, like cowboys, to save it. All fake. They spent their whole time in hotels with prostitutes... "Remember the Maine!" Excellente Teddy! My brother and I, at age 11, made films with this. I don't know if you ever used this kind? Yes, in film school. So with this camera... we filmed other kids dressed as soldiers, with plastic helmets and plastic guns. We made war movies. I remember we wanted to make an explosion. So as the little soldier was running. I was filming and had the idea to take a bucket of dirt, and have my brother throw the dirt outside of the frame, I said "ACTION!" and I shook the camera like in a newsreel, when the camera shakes when there's an explosion. When we screened the film at home, my dad asked: "Son, where did you get the explosives?" I said: "There're no explosives. It's a trick." I then realized that I, 11 years old, had fooled my dad! Making him believe there was an explosion. So then, we went crazy over cinema! It's magic. But when you take one frame at a time, you're making animation. Are you preparing a documentary? Yes about the attack when the United States invaded Santiago. When the Spaniards came to America, native people populated the island, and the Caribbean. Then they... ...exterminated them! Because they made them work hard, you see? To take all the wealth, like sugar cane, and gold... to the metropolis, to Spain. To deliver a mountain of money to the king. That's why we are such a mix of origins: There are Blacks, Chinese, Whites... for example, you are a beautiful, racial mix. You have a fine face. I really like to dance, and become an actress. You can be an actress, dance, sing... Be who you want to be! You want to be an actress? You want to please people, like Beyonce? Forever, humans loved being told stories, being told a tale. I imagine that in primitive caves somebody told stories and everyone listened, picturing it, imagining the story. War at sea, the naval battles were little models. Explain that! The producers of these films filled a tank with water, little model destroyers and battle ships, blew them up with small firecrackers, and blew smoke from cigars. They filmed "naval battles", and the spectators believed it, just like my dad with the explosion! They thought the battles were real. Cinema is witchcraft! This was propaganda against "the evil Spaniards". It's war! Explosions! The battle of Santiago de Cuba! We can be manipulated into believing things... "It is easier to fool people than it is to persuade them that they have been fooled", Mark Twain said. The Spanish-American War was a war of new imperialism. For over a century now, the world has been transforming into an interventionist society. But why? Why is America always at war? The ship... was the symbol of colonialism in America. The train was the symbol of colonialism in Africa. The camera is the symbol of colonialism of the United States. The cinema produced in Hollywood, "industrial cinema", has won the war... It changed the world! Annielys, are you interested in the history the world, and of your country? Yes I am very interested, because I learned about the North American intervention in Cuba. That was something very cruel, but against which, one can fight. It was something very cruel, because it was something that should not have been done. Because Cuba wanted to be a free nation, a country, where everyone could express what they feel. But it was not possible, because the North Americans, with the pretext of wanting to liberate us from the domination of Spain, came and intervened in our country. Because of that, Cubans already realized that the USA didn't do it to help. They just wanted to stay here. And the Cubans realized that they sought a covert way to stay in our country, and came up with the "Platt Amendment". Explain the Platt Amendment! That's what I am doing now! - She knows it well, and you? - No. The "Platt Amendment" is an appendix added to our constitution of 1902, and proposed by governor Leonard Wood. It had 8 articles. Article 3 stated that... it was like handing the key to our country over to the USA, so they could enter and leave as desired, and intervene in our political discourse and such. Article 7 stated that we must give up our naval bases. The naval base, which is still Illegally occupied is Guantanamo. The first-ever American flag overseas was raised in Guantanamo. Followed by nine hundred - as we speak today - in the world. Nine hundred flags? 900 American military outposts in the world! And one is on the moon! The moon of America. America put a flag on the moon in 1969 ... '79, '89, '99, 2009, 2018... 50 years the moon has been ... It's not that great! So... we've got to make it great again! What has it been doing? What has the moon been doing? We are going to make the moon great again. "...make the moon great again!" What is this monument? The "Maine". Dedicated to victims of the explosion of the "Maine". This is history... It was an assault, an attempt. An assault on our country. - The French, or... - The Americans! It's all crazy! They themselves did it to have an excuse to intervene on our island. By then we were colonized by Spain. On top was an eagle, but when the revolution triumphed, they broke off the eagle. I am an honest man, from the land where palm trees grow, and before I die I want to let my verses out of my soul Guantanamera, peasant girl from Guantanamo... The United States and Cuba were filled with hate. They did not like each other at all. I do not know any history. As you can see, she knows nothing, She was not yet born in those days. No, she is talking nonsense. They want you to give them chewing gum. She is an idiot. Shut up! Perucho Figeredo gave freedom to the slaves on October 10th, the year 1959. 1888. And thanks to... our national leader of Cuba Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz we have labor centres, hospitals, construction and schools! Homeland or death... We shall win! We are the vanguard of the revolution... Down with imperialism! Up with freedom! Cuba, Cuba... Studies! Labor! Guns! Is this the museum of revolution? Yes. Military stuff. He was frozen. The man they found in this plane was... an American but not alive. He was dead. Comrade Castro was a military man, He knew military tactics and stuff? How to fight a war and win it? - Yes ! So the revolution lasted 13 years? - Yes, man... These people, 88 people... went to Cuba, in the East, to recruit many people to fight, to control Cuba, But people living in Havana didn't want that, didn't want revolution! They wanted Batista, wanted Machado... American people, casinos, money... drugs, cocaine, everything, by that time. That makes sense. So when Fidel, Raul, Che Guevara... came from Camaguey, Guantanamo, Santiago de Cuba... When the Revolution started it was good. When Fidel started, it was good. My mother told me the first ten years Cuba was perfect... Fidel Castro perfect, perfect, Cubans happy... No problems, no violence, food, public buses, taxis, homes... When the Soviet Union broke apart, no more help for Cuba, things started to change, problems with food etc... So, when you see the "outside world" and you see what we call capitalism, so many options for consumers, so much different clothes to buy, shoes, jewellery, make-up ... and you don't get much of that here, does that cause a bit of a... do you feel like... For what... Feel happy! Drinks and salsa! Interesting. What are you cooking? Little, fried potatoes. Want some potatoes? I like my country, and I like Reggae, too. When Columbus came to Cuba he said... this here is... He said the following: "The most beautiful land that man's eyes have ever seen". "The most beautiful island..." When he saw the beaches... -Who said that? -Christopher Columbus! - About Cuba? - Yes, when he saw the beach... Was he right? Of course... And the women, too! - What's the name of this hotel? - "Roosevelt" The name is American... Rossevelt... Yes, the granddaughter of the hotel owner. It is the family of the hotel's owner. Who used to be the owners of the hotel What was their name? Look, the name's there. "Rossenbel..." -The owner? -The owner. Was this not the American ex-president? Yes, but I don't know anything else... Because I don't live here. Thanks anyway. Nobody knows anything. It's been many years now people only know that it was a hotel. Roosevelt. It was in 1926. I don't know anything. The U.S. government is attacking Cuba economically. Facing these criminal actions, the Cuban resistance is unbreakable. There is "Che". The greatest revolutionary in the world! He was also president of the National Bank This is the ministry of sugar. -Ministry of what? -Of sugar! And side products of sugar! Rum... Ministry of rum and sugar Repeat the conditional number of the Hershey run... Movement eight-zero-seven! I have not received the conditional number, nor the direction of the course, nor the destination of the track. It was a very beautiful sugar factory, it was a refinery. Refinery for white sugar. White sugar. White... No brown sugar was made here. Here we made sugar for Coca Cola! Really? Coca Cola... It was America's best refinery. Twenty-one thousand bags... ...per day. -And now what? -Nothing. And Coca Cola does not come back? No, no. Are these cars of the gringo Mafia? Don't you think? Holy shit. International. - How are you? - What? Take a photo of me! Not the old guy, take my photo! Should I keep walking? As you wish! President Obama begins this historic voyage to Havana. The blue waters beneath Air Force One once carried American battleships to this island, to liberate, but also to exert control over Cuba. My house is your house! I have a new look: like Erykah Badu! What do you call your "hood"? This here is Centro Habana Colon... Here is the market where they sell lots of good things... Here is my water tank. Very important... I like it when you film me, it makes me feel exactly like an actress. Here is my little one. Let me show you the house. My fan, it's American... it gives us good air. Here are my photos. I bought my Russian washing machine. - Does it work well? - Boy, does it! Here is my kitchen, but there's no water now because of the storm. The bathroom. The fridge... I got it from Venezuela, ideological battle. She's in paradise. He says the kid is in paradise. I put this on for a photo! Dear people of Cuba! With profound sadness, It is my duty to inform our people that today, at 10:29 p.m. the commander-in-chief of the Cuban Revolution has died, Fidel Castro Ruz. Founder of the Cuban Revolution. To victory, always! The people of Havana and Cuba are crying. Men and women crying for their leader. And all are making images with their cell phones filming this historic moment in tribute to the commander Fidel Castro. ...for a death of glory, because dying for the homeland means living. Fidel, Fidel means peace. Viva Fidel! Viva! The commander-in-chief of the Cuban Revolution is only one. Fidel is irreplaceable. Venice, Messina, Barcelona, Malaga, Valencia, Funchal, Madeira, and then over here. American Embassy, yes. No to imperialism... Fatherland or death! We shall triumph! Viva Fidel! Sun, life, having fun. What about Cuba by night? What's it like? You can take a stroll in Cuba by night, you will not be harmed. There is great nightlife, you can be sure... that as a Bavarian, a hundred times per evening you will be asked, if you want to have a sweet night. I see! Here is "Plaza de la Revolution" Amazing!! This is the highlight! Look how beautiful. Exactly, they are pink. A Chevrolet... Travellers who come here are people who have already travelled the world. And they are on a quest for the yet undiscovered paradise. Paradise is simply a myth, it's an alternative: break out of the professional, social, and family prison. For 14 days, escape your shitty life at home. Do you like it here? More or less. What happens here in Cuba is that... we Cubans are used to... it is because they... are treating other people like... they are superior to us, and they have more money and more... more of everything. They are richer than us. Some of us don't know... what goes on abroad. Some Cubans think that... that they are coming to harm us, and treat us badly... Look, they know nothing about the history of Cuba, they come to Cuba to know and see museums... A lot of times Cubans are lacking medicines to cure people... Now there is that damned Trump, Trump cares about nobody... he has no feelings. He does not lift the embargo, talks about the bad things in Cuba... and he closed the borders to migrants. America? American friend? Which country? Great photo! Give me something for the photo! - For you. - Thanks! That's from New York, so nice... Look mum! The conditions that they have... pretty tragic... but I guess under the circumstances you have no choice. I gave him a pen from New York City He's really excited about it. He can write his name... This other girl wanted money for photographs, but I'm never going to pay for a photograph cause... to be photographed by me is an honour. Ernesto Miller Hemingway. "The New Man" that should come out of the Revolution. A new kind of human. I was a kid in a village which was kind of invaded by tourists. We were understood that there are two types of human beings: "normal humans", and tourists. They are a type of people who are only being served, comfortable, big, drinking beer, talking very loudly, eating a lot... and they never worked. There was always this sense that they are taking over... taking all the terrain, taking all the space, and the attention of my parents. My parents were innkeepers, and gave all their attention to the fucking tourists!... I'd like to say that tourists are... humanity, are human beings... in their worst possible form. What kind of future is built by tourism?... None! It is only devours the future. It devours the past and culture, it renders everything superficial, into stupidity... into a relationship of power, constantly. It's only superficial, a fiction and a auto-fiction. But... this is our subject. When we ask ourselves while filming... if we see it in context, How much does making cinema resemble tourism? It's something to ask oneself, not to respond to, just to question. Hubert! Hubert, just in case... no, nothing. Any chance... Will you eat at your house? Today? With Tony? Maybe I'll eat out. - In a restaurant? - Yes. - With me? - Ok. Super, precise education, strict and absolutely correct, an outstanding artistic education for ballet! He is militaristic. Very good, thank you! He is a German artist. He is a tango dancer. Let's see if he can give us a presentation... Please translate for him! He knows tango, he said. I am staying here for the next two weeks... Tell him to come back when he wants to! - The kids are yours! - Thanks! I gave up dancing. Helicopter! Hey Hubert! - Did you bring your telephone? - Yes. - Take it out! - Why? -Take it out! -What do you want? Take it out! I discovered something... What do you want to do? A few photos. Move Angelo, over there! Come on, move! Look, it's slow motion. Amazing! How do you know how to film this way? I discovered it! Look at this one! Fucking great! Charlie Chaplin! - With his hat... - And cane. I want to be an actress. Movie actress... No... for TV series. My mama will sign me up for singing... and guitar. - Like your papa. - Yes. It's a long time since you've seen him? Yes... ...something like three years. My dream is to travel to France. Leoneli, how do you imagine France? With a giant tower. I don't know if it is very cold or very hot. And you love cinema? Yes... and very much! Can I go out with my boyfriend? Did you do your homework? - Go to your room and sleep! - No! It is very late! What are you saying, you little shit face? Then go to bed! Don't tempt me please, I am very pissed off, I had a bad day at work, You are a mistake of life! You are a mistake, I should never have had you! I'll tell you more: Your father is not your father! You should not be my mother. You are a whore! Bravo, bravo!! What do you fancy? What do you want to be... Right now? I want... I want to get revenge for something that happened to me at another time. What happened to you then? For example... the person that I want to do it to humiliated me, treated me badly... You can invent a story which makes you feel very bad. In front of everyone. But it must not be real. It must be made up, because we don't want to hurt anyone. But how do they know we are... that we are playing? That is a good question! And if they take it for real? Then you have won! If they believe you, you are an actress! Why did you choose to be an actress? Because I like to tell stories. We tell the stories we desire telling to make people feel as if they had an experience, right? True and profound, with a bit of luck, profound. Therefore, by creating stories, one creates reality. Look, Lioneli is eating all your food. So the stories created from lies, have become reality. They have... the stories which are lies, have a reality. But whoever makes up the stories, tells them at their own convenience. The explorers... they killed, murdered, gunned down... and then they told their stories at their own convenience. That is what I think. I think... I will explore! The global explorer! Where do you go, my child? To paradise! Adios!!! I am in Paradise! Hello honey! Where are you from? You like Cuba? Of course, sister! I have many dreams. For me, the ideal world is something non-existent. Why? Because of imperialism. It's a very bad thing. That's why we say "Down with imperialism... ...forward freedom", because the people feel oppressed, due to the aggression of the USA. And how do you imagine the United States? Beautiful. My dream is going to Disney. - Disneyland? - Yes. Why? Because I see how people on Facebook, post photos and everything looks beautiful. And seeing the cartoon figures... in real life. Like in old fairytales, the Barbies, my daughter's favorites, Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse. With the actors, Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, Everything lit up, full of light, This is for me the American dream. The path to the American dream bears great obstacles. ... "America Latina"! Trump dislikes immigrants, they are Guatemalans. And they go to Mexico, and the United States... to find a better life, because at home they have no place to sleep... But Trump does not want Guatemalans to enter the U.S. Why does he not want that? Because he is mean, and because he is a racist. Look! Look how people live! In our country one cannot live... I am innocent. One threatens with the army to stop the migrants. It seems like a war zone... It is the government. The people are one thing, the government is another. It's just politics. Almost all Americans from the United States... don't want all these problems and wars. But the government begins business with armaments, interferes in countries, kills people. But me, if I were a woman from the U.S., a mother, I'd never want my sons to go to war... The people can think one thing, but the rulers of the system... have control. Are you going to bring a gun to the White House... to go shoot the mad guy, boom? Who will do that? These guys have security. They do what they want. Americans have freedom of speech, which we do not have here. They can express opinions on the internet, etc... But the leaders don't give a fuck about what people think. And they do what they want. They do what they want because they have the power, power of money, power to control many things, weapons and such stuff. This dude, what is his name again, the new guy? The new president of the U.S. now? -What is his name? -I'm not telling you. That mad guy... with all the money he has... he beat Obama and everyone, "You might have good ideas, but I am the guy, I am the millionaire, and I am going to be the president!..." Look at the face of that man! He resembles Bush, and all these people, even Roosevelt himself. All these sons of bitches have the same traits... Faces of people who like war and wealth, and create problems, invest money in conflict. They enjoy it. They are politicians. They like that. They don't give a shit about what happens to the people. They just invest in oil and steal it from other countries. Or invest in sugar and then leave it, etc... All that to have power, have control inventing a story that the world is bad and they are good... You see... "You Americans came because you are rich." Most Americans are not in favor of these politics! Finally, the poor are poorer, and the rich are richer. If we are not like these people, we try to survive above madness... Every president has a madness... I am speaking in favour of Cuba, nothing against! They will kill me. Give me a cigarette! They will kill me! We are looking for a place to stay... Understand?... He is looking for a place to... have sex with the tourist. But it seems that the tourist... is afraid to have sex with him. These are the "Gringas" who come here looking for black dicks. With her little nigger... It's a kind of slavery: "You take my dick..." It's like you're here to pay for my pussy. It's that "You are Gringo and you pay, I'd have to do anything you say". Doggy style, "woof woof..." A piece of meat. Hey guys, come check this out! Two thousand five hundred thirty-five dollars! This pen! 2,535 dollars. At least my grandmother works in a hospital, she is giving food to... to the patients. - And she earns 20 dollars. - Per month? And my mama earns 4 dollars. - Per day! - Yes. So how many days does she have to work for a pen? Endlessly! Cuba could be paradise in a way... but it's a country made for foreigners. The Cubans are a fascinating people. They imagine they will be fighting against America, against the power. So that's why people want to see the last country... the last communist country. -Like an attraction? -Yeah... Before the change. What does "utopia" mean to you? Utopia? Utopia is something that does not exist in reality... it is something that we dream, but we cannot realize. When I come from Italy to here, it seems to me to like re-entering a big theatre. They open the curtain, the stage, and I start to live another life, in the past. That is the sensation I feel. This is the Park Hotel, there is the Manzana Hotel... How much are the rooms here? Eight hundred, four hundred, three hundred... A lot of money. One night. Lucky Luciano had a meeting here with 500 Mafiosi. Coming from the U.S., Poland, Italy and Sicily. Drugs, alcohol, prostitution and gambling. Everything illegal. Here it was called the island of... everything was possible. So they had to organize the Mafia here. This here is a hotel built by the Mafia. Parkhotel Central! We want to go swim! You know, they have an amazing pool there! Let's go! I'll swim like this. Let's see if he lets us... the stupid cop... swim in the pool. Swim in the pool! - What are we today? - Gringos! The three of us are illegals! When we get near the hotel, I will speak English with you... You just say "yes, yes..." And you say "ok, ok..." I will talk in English, so... the doormen will think we are Gringos! "Ok, Daddy..." "Ok, Daddy..." The pool is exclusively for hotel guests! It is forbidden! No exceptions! I'm sorry I don't speak Spanish, I... I am security. You need to leave! What's our room number? "2507". It's freezing! I pissed. I pissed in the pool. That's illegal! Will they find out? If you piss, the whole pool changes colour! Will you buy another cake? - If you want. - Yes! Costs only ten dollars! Do not buy one! Here we are at Central Park, in front of Hotel Manzana, where pens cost as much as one's entire last will and testament! And now, after I die... before I die, and sign my testament, my will is to ride in a convertible, like a total American tourist. For my rounds in Havana, in a nice pink color... Fena! The first time we filmed together, it was about utopia... We don't pass by your home? Yes - Noooo! - You are crazy! - The neighbors will kill us! They will throw... dead chickens at us! On this corner police can stop you, but they won't know if I am Cuban or a foreigner. It's because of the camera... I hope there's no problem, when they see my face. People know her here, she lives on a fucking island, if people see her with us, they'll say: "You are a prostitute..." Robert! You're concentrating! - What do you want to do? - We want to take some photos, with an interview, as if it were a fancy magazine. We'll print photos and frame them. Yes? But with my own clothes. You're making another film? No film! Some fashion photos. Mama can you come out with us? - What? - He wants you to come along. Forget the people. I know you are taking care of them. But people wonder: "What is this foreigner doing with the kids..." Tell people to go fuck themselves. Did you hear what mum just said?... "Aut Caesar aut nullus", Emperor of the world! This is the grandfather of Oona! My grandfather! She is Hitler's grandchild? Shut up! - Charlie Chaplin! - Charlie Chaplin was your grandfather? You can't see my moustache? And Oona is an actress! How is it possible... that an American could be filming an execution by the Spaniards, without being killed himself? Not possible. Fake, right? So how did they do it? Maybe they did it afterwards... for their propaganda, they did it... with actors... they filmed the war at their own convenience. People believed what happens in films. People thought this is the truth. But in the end it was a tremendous hoax. Is this the end of the world? Not today... The end of the world will be much later... Not today! - Let's make a movie, ... - As if it were real. Not real! Fantasy, telling stories! Oona! Where are we now? In paradise. N e a n i k o P l a n o Subtitles
