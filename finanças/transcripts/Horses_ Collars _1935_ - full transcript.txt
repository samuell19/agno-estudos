[♪] The case you are about to go on is very dangerous. It requires courage, ingenuity, and above all things, intelligence. That's why I sent for you. I missed. I didn't. Quit staring at me. You make me nervous. Yes, yes. Go on. I have a client out west who owns a ranch and is in danger of losing it. How come? It seems that my client's father signed an IOU for $10,000 over to Double Deal Decker, the gambling boss of Maverick Center. Well, what about it? Well, after he signs it, Decker frames a gunfight, has the father shot, leaving my client holding the bag. Go on, boss. Your story's gripping me. And if my client doesn't pay the $10,000, Decker will take my client's ranch. What does your client look like? Ah, she's very attractive. Oh, a woman. [WHOOPING] Her picture's here on the desk. Which is her face? My wife. My error. [BIRD CHIRPING] Here. Spread out. And here is a picture of Double Deal Decker. He always carries the IOU with him. You have got to get it by hook or crook. But remember, he's a killer. Let's see it. [CHUCKLES] He looks like a lily to me. [PANTING] Moe, Larry, the cheese. [WHOOPING] [CRASHING] Will you hold him? Moe, Larry, the cheese! Okay, okay. Moe, Larry, the cheese. Wait a minute. Take it easy. Here. Here. No, Roquefort. The cheese. Oh, all right. Well, just a minute. Roquefort, Roquefort. Roquefort! Roquefort! There you are. [MOANING] [MUFFLED] Roquefort. [MOANING] Whew. What's the matter with him? We forgot to tell you. Every time he see a mouse, he goes crazy. He's marked that way. Why? Because his father was a rat. [BAND PLAYING UPBEAT MUSIC] [SIGHS] That'll be four bits. Try and collect it. Wait a minute. I'm gonna give you one chance. Draw. [COCKS] [MEN GROANING] [THUD] DECKER: All right, boys. Sweep 'em out. [SPITTOON CLINKING] The next time any strangers come around here, I won't be so easy. That's right, boss. [HORSES APPROACHING] STOOGES: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! [MOE SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY] [ALL COUGHING] Well, partner. Give me glasses. That bottle. [ALL GAGGING, GASPING] [COUGHING] Thanks, bartender. Hey. What about the money? Go on, that's a tin roof. What do you mean? It's a tin roof. It's on the house. Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk. That's a hot one. Wait a minute. A wisecracker, huh? Oh, sort of a toughie, eh? Draw. [CLINK] [CLINK] Nice shootin', stranger. You ain't seen nothing yet. Toss up a quarter. Nice shot, son. Got a $5 gold piece? Sure. Thanks. Toss it. [GUNSHOT] Here's your quarter. There's your change. Thanks, partner. Boy, you look 10 years younger. [ALL LAUGH] You keep your eye on 'em. First crooked move they make, we'll give 'em the works. Right, boss. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Nell. It's Nell. Miss Higginbottom to youse guys. If you was alone, I'd punch you right in the nose. Well, why don't you do it? Well, I'm-- I'm with you. What are you doing? NELL: Gentlemen. Be seated. Sure. A pleasure. Hiya, Nell. If you gentlemen don't get that IOU for me, I'll lose my ranch, and... You got nothing to worry about. Are you good detectives? See that heel? Yes. I ran that down. [STOOGES CHUCKLE] [LOUD CRUNCHING] Quiet. I can't hear the lady. Shh. Here comes Decker now. If he asks you to dance with him, accept. Why? Simple. We'll get dancing partners... You bump Decker into us... And we'll frisk him and get the IOU. Oh. Sometimes you got brains. Thank you, thank you. Don't let 'em go to your head. [BAND PLAYING UPBEAT MUSIC] Good evening, Nell. At last I have found you alone. How about tripping the light fantastic? Delighted. Excuse me. Listen, mugs. We gotta be careful. Lobo's watching every move. Now, get this. Every time somebody bumps into you on the dance floor, reach back and go for that IOU. Got it? All right, get your partners. Spread out. Would you care to dance with me? Oh, I'd be delighted. [SIGHS] Say, girlie, you're light on your feet. That's what they all say. Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk. [MOUTHING WORDS] [MOUTHING WORDS] Pardon me. You mind if I cut in? Why, no. Thanks. CURLEY: I'm not much of a leader, you know. MOE: Let's go. You know, you're not a bad dancer. Aw, I bet you tell that to all the boys. Heh. Now, you listen to me. Yes? Decker's wallet's got a chain on it. Yes, yes? Tell Larry. Why, certainly. You know, you're not a bad dancer yourself. Are you insinuating? No, just dancing. That was very kind of you, babe. Wise guy. We put it over on him. That's teamwork. Teamwork. The boss oughta give us a raise for this. It oughta be in here, boys. [APPLAUSE] Ah, here it is. What are you grabbing? Wonder where he keeps it. There were-- ♪ Oh ♪ STOOGES: ♪ You'll never know ♪ ♪ Just what tears are ♪ ♪ Till you cry Like you made me cry ♪ Hey, Decker! So thieves, huh?

We'll ship you home. Come on. Hey, wait for me. [WHOOPING] Mr. Decker, you're making a big mistake. Let me explain. Yeah? Well, we'll hang 'em first, you can do your explaining later.
