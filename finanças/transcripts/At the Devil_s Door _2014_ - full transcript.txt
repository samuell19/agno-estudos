- Previously on Empire... - What is that? I wouldn't be able to handle if you lost this election because of me. - Whoa... - No. I think you should go. I'm gonna put myself out there, in solidarity, alongside Ms. Lyon and women everywhere. I love you, Angelo. What about Freda Gatz? I heard she out. I hear she's dope. Freda's the one, Shine. She's all yours. You know, her father was locked up with Lucious and Frank Gathers. He got killed up there. The whole concept of the album, it's about my family, the secrets. I'm-a set us all free. Jamal, wake up. I think Jamal O.D.'d. Tiana, why is it like pulling teeth every time I talk to you, hmm? Just get to the damn studio, girl, okay? Look, I have not had my morning coffee yet. I'm not trying to have this argument with you... This bitch hung up on me? What's up? Aw, you look agitated. Let me tell you what you're thinking. You're thinking, "Oh, didn't I just break up with this fool? Why is he at my door? Oh, but he's got my favorite mocha latte. Maybe I should..." Uh, Angelo, when I'm agitated, the last thing you need to be doing is telling me why I'm agitated, okay? Look, I have a record to produce, and I have an artist who's acting like a two-year-old. Get your punk ass in the studio. So thank you for the latte. Now, why are you here? Snatch your weave, I can... I got your text. I'm glad you enjoyed the press conference. Okay. Can I get my...? Come here. I know you know how I feel about you. And I think I know how you feel about me. So I need to know, are you in or are you out? N-Now, wait... Did you just give me an ultimatum? Mm-hmm. Okay. Mmm. Hold up. Wait. So does this mean you're in? I think this means you're in. Donkey of the Day today goes to one of Lucious Lyon's khaki-colored kids, Jamal Lyon. Here's a guy born into music royalty, and then he bitched up after he got shot. Damn. I blame your daddy. It's hard for me to believe that Lucious could raise such a soft-ass individual. You know he's a donkey, but he's more like a turkey. He's Donkey of the Day, but he's Turkey of the Year. T-T-Turkey of the Year. Okay, so what is this for? Bring me in on a Saturday to, what, attack me? No. Everything that Charlamagne is saying is true, and it's time we do something about that. Where's Mom? Where's your mama? She's in charge of music; this is business. And right now your stats are dropping on Empire XStream, so we need to have a little conversation about this, son. I wish that you literally did not even buy this-this streaming service, because, ever since you did, it kills all creativity. It's all about numbers now. It's always been about numbers. And right now you ain't puttin' none up. I'm over here lookin' at the money that you're burnin' through to record this so-called new music of yours that ain't nobody heard. - That's numbers, too, Mal. - Oh, no, I-I actually heard a lot of the tracks, and they're lit. Okay, where they at? A-And what in the hell is this? Um, a visual team? You shootin' a video and you ain't even finished the damn record yet? It's not a video. It's a visual... I-It's like a musical museum. Um, are you kidding me? I have the chance right now to possibly do something that could change the game. But if y'all just keep on killing me with stats, - it's not gonna happen. - No, the only person that's killing you right now, Mal, is you. 'Cause the one thing that ain't changed in the music business is artists that don't perform, they die. He's right, Jamal. If you don't... I'm so sorry, Steve. I'm-I'm not trying to be rude, but you are in PR. And my father clearly stated that this is a business meeting. So I guess maybe he just needed a whole bunch of extra bodies or something. I don't know. But if you are done now talking business, Lucious, then I'm cool. Look, the numbers are right where we want them, okay? So just sit tight, let me take care of it. - I always do, all right? - Sounds good, Dre. Yeah, let me look over the numbers and then I'll just give you a... Um, let me call you back. All right, I'll talk to you later. - Hello. - Hello. What's that face for? I have an invitation for you and also a warning. - Okay. - The invitation: tomorrow night, it'll be six years since my brother Stone died. Every year we have a memorial for him up by the first building he and Shine ever bought. All of our people turn up. We sing and we party and we family. And I would like it if you came. Of course. Now for the warning: Shine kind of wants to kill you. You and your father sold me a damn bill of goods with this Freda Gatz mess. I told her Lucious signed her to my label. Guess what she told me: that if I ever believed a Lyon, then I've been played. She's never gonna record for Empire again. I know I didn't spare your punk-ass life just to be played. Look, I had no idea that Freda felt that way, okay? - I'll fix it. - How? What if I get her to come to your party tomorrow night? - That's for family. - Exactly. I think it's a great idea, Shine, and I think you need to bring Freda. There you go. Why aren't you taking this seriously, man? Drugs are a big deal. Dude, you need to relax. He was passed out, not dead. Yeah, this time. That doesn't make it okay for you to feed him drugs. I'm not some dope boy getting some white girl hooked on crack. I'm a producer. I take the same pills as Jamal. Hell, everyone does. Are you that ignorant? "Everyone does it" is not an excuse when you got a sit... Wait, wait, wait. You know what, let me tell you something... Stop. Hey. We're not doing that. You're right. We're not doing that. Hey. Now, look, studio time is booked and I sent you those stems and you still haven't worked on them. I got you. That's the stuff I was telling you about. It's a little less harsh than what the doctor's giving you. I don't want a repeat of the other night, all right? Look, I know that we need to talk about what happened, okay? But I can't right now. My mama's on the way up. So later. - You haven't told her what happened... - I said later. That means later. Y'all need to back up off me for a second. Hey, Ma. Hey. Look at my ho'ish baby. Got two grown men sprung. First of all, I'm not ho'in'. - Mmm. - U-Unfortunately. Look, D-Major is my producer, and Philip is just my therapist. That's it. Look, boy, I got 15 minutes. - Let me hear this new music. - A'ight. I got to meet Angelo's stuck-up mama. You're meeting his mama already? I think she just want to check out my black ass. You mean your naked selfie black ass? Don't be fresh. - Ow! - Now, come on, boy. Let me hear this. This is a song for you. - Randy, we good, man. Thank you. - Mm-hmm. What is all this? Look, first of all, you're not just hearin' it, you're not just listening to it. You're seeing it. You're supposed to live it. Okay, is that what all of this is about? That's what all this is. Sit down. Mm. Oh, my God, that's me. That's Candace. That's Carol... - ♪ Listen, Mama... ♪ - Where'd you get these, Jamal? Aunt Carol gave me a whole bunch of home videos. ♪ "Strong" would be an understatement ♪ ♪ "Warrior" would... ♪ Oh.

You had no right digging that stuff up. Mom, you and-and Dad and the whole... - I c... No, I got to go! - Mom... just wait... And don't use those videos, Jamal! I'm gonna be late for Angelo's mama. Damn! How you doing? I haven't seen your mother yet, dear. Ooh. She's about to make her entrance. Everyone knows that I dislike artifice, so I'm going to thank you all in advance for your very generous contributions to Angelo's mayoral campaign. Please fill out the cards, place them in the little velvet bags being passed around by my staff, and enjoy the champagne et canapès mes amis. Well done, Mother. So, where is Cookie Lyon? Mmm. Um, I don't know. Let's give her... a few more minutes. You don't know? I don't. Mother. Am I to understand that I am being stood up by this woman? Mm... After what the whole world saw sagging in that pitiful little naked photo? This was to be our statement to our people that she's not that kind of person. - I realize that. - Mmm. This will never do, child. Boy, I'm telling you, these packs are like 84% human. All you got to do is take 'em to my homegirl down in Bed-Stuy, she will have your dreads flowin', okay? Like, down-your-back flowin'. - Down my back? - Yeah. Uh, now give me a second so I can talk - to my nephew, please. - Hey, Aunt Carol. - Hi, baby. - Hot damn, Jamal Lyon! - Hey. - What's going on, brother? This your nephew? - Yes, it is. - Goddamn. Can I take a picture? Okay, wait, wait. No. Why don't you go get the Malaysian hair down on aisle nine? - Man, I'm a big... - Come on, go ahead. - Thank you, man. - They got the pink and the yellow. - Man, I'm a fan, man. - Yo, I appreciate you. The purple, too. Okay, okay. And what you bring me? Okay, who is this? How you doing? Hi. I'm Auntie Carol. Yeah, Aunt Carol... Ah, he's so cute, okay. Hey, this is Philip, Aunt Carol. - He's my, um... - Mmm, mmm! Never mind, but you aired me out with those videos, Aunt Carol. All right, what's going on? Oh, man. Nephew, they're basically the tea of all teas. It's the reason why me, Cookie and Candace be at it so much. Well, look, I'm trying to launch my entire album based on that one song, so, please. Why did my mom freak out like that? What album? We been waiting on your ass since that gay, bald-headed chick shot you at the ASAs. ♪ God forbidding what's forgiven ♪ ♪ This life we living vibe high never lie ♪ - Bye. - ♪ Try breeze through ♪ ♪ Right by look at me like the bad guy... ♪ I just never seen her like that. You know? So I get that it's bad, but I need to know. I was hoping she was gonna come clean. If I tell you, you know she gonna fight me, - and that bitch can go. - I get it, Aunt Carol. It goes all the way back to when Cookie first met Lucious. Lucious. Hey, look, uh... Oh, boy. Can I have a minute with my man? You sure he's your man? Ooh! Mm-mm. Go fetch. Little cheap-ass bag. - Come on, Olive Oil. You, too. - Oh. Look, please don't make me say sorry more than once. Well, let me hear you say it for a first time, before I make any decisions. I just did. Oh, and that's not cutting it, Cookie. This was a big deal. I know. And don't talk over me. Now, music is to your family what politics is to mine, and I respect that. But you disrespected my mother. It's not cool. Okay. I'm sorry. See? I said it again. Look, something came up. Jamal found these old videos, and... I can't really... explain it... right now. The memories... It's-it's just... My father, th-those images. I chose Lucious, and I should have chosen someone like you. All right. Why'd you keep me out so late? I broke my curfew. Like you wanted to leave. Come here, give me a kiss. - Mm-hmm. - Okay, I got to go. I'm sorry, Dad. The girls... they kept me out longer - than I thought. - No. I can't do this no more. You got to go. - Dad. - You got to go. Dad. No, please. No, I'm sorry. I... Guns and drug money? I know that's his. I know this is Lucious! Dad, look, I'm sorry. I just... Look, I promise I won't... I won't see him again. Baby girl, as much as it's killing me, you got to go. I got two other girls to think of. - I ain't got time for this. - Dad, I'm sorry. Please, Dad. I can't let that boy ruin them like he ruined you. Damn, Loretha! Dad, I'm sorry. Dad. Dad, please! Daddy. Dad. Dad, please. Can I please just make it up to you? Can I just take your mother and you out to dinner? Um, where does she like to go? Where's her favorite restaurant? Is it here? What does she like to eat? - I'll have the staff make it. - Okay, okay, okay, okay. - Please. - Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Um... - Dinner here. - Okay. With your boys, all right? I'll pick the menu. Yeah, my mother's big on family, so... she'll probably like your sons, especially Andre. She went to Penn. - So, yeah. - Oh. I didn't know that. Mm-hmm. Okay, consider it done. Done. You gonna sing whatever you were singing to them cheap bitches you was talking to, grinning all... all up in their faces? - They were here on time, so... - Whatever. You know I'm crazy. Come here. That's not how you hold her. Give me. I know, baby. Your daddy's stupid. And I shouldn't have to beg y'all to go to dinner. You haven't begged us. You yelled at us. - 'Cause y'all keep bickering. - 'Cause he took my girl! And now you're taking my daughter? Hakeem, you don't want to dig that up, man. Hey! Hey! Look. Shut up! I don't ask for much. Yes, you do. Have you met you? I'll be there. When is it? Tomorrow night, 8:00 p.m. sharp. - Tomorrow night? - Yup. - I can't make it. - Uh-uh, uh-uh! Andre, I need you! Okay? Now I never ask you for nothing. Please. I'm sorry I reacted the way I did. You know I didn't do that to hurt you. I know. It's just... It brought up a lot of heavy stuff. Stuff I thought I buried. That's all we do is bury stuff. This family and its secrets. Ma, we can't do what Dad did with Andre and Grandma. You can talk to me. If you love me, you ain't got to lie to me. Stop. Stop right here. Daddy. Daddy. Please, please, wake up. Dad! - Dad, wake up... - Candace! Candace?! Candace, what happened?! - Daddy had a heart attack. - What happened? We're gonna go with them to the hospital. - Okay, come on. Come on! - No. We are going with them to the hospital. You stressed Daddy out enough. Go be with Lucious. That's who you want to be with anyways, right? Dad... Daddy died that night. It was three days since he kicked me out. Me and your father were holed up in a motel somewhere. A neighbor had to come get me. Candace blamed me, and she was right. My daddy was my life... until I met that boy. - Mom... - And after that, we were all each other had. Your father and I... we-we practically raised each other. I mean, hustling and surviving together in the streets. I don't know what to say. That's why all roads lead to Lucious. For Carol, for Candace, for all of us. If you need to use those videos because they inspire you, I will let you do that, Jamal, but I can't watch that mess. I hear you. So you gonna show up for me tomorrow, help me get my new man's mama in line? Look, if it helps you get over Lucious, I'm there. - I'm already over his ass. - Good. Might even gonna sit in-between Hakeem and Andre. Better wear a helmet. - Put Nessa there. - Ooh! Okay, teach me how to be a society bitch, Candace. You only got one night, so there's only so much I can do. Damn, you act like I ain't got no kind of home training. Come on, it ain't all that. So fake ass. You know you ain't nothing but an Oreo. When you gonna...? Do you want my help or not? All right. - Let's start with the placement. - The what? That's French for the little white card that tells you where to sit. Girl, forget those cards! I need you to observe however I move, I need to learn how to conversate. You know, like, just watch my mannerisms. What do I say to this bougie bitch? Like, I mean, I shouldn't call her a bitch. That's his mama. It's "converse," and don't talk with your mouth full. With Angelo's mother being one of those old-school, minority, sorority chicks, you're gonna have to really come correct. How you know she in a sorority? I looked her up online. She's in the same one as Coretta Scott King, Maya Angelou and Rosa Parks. So if you get stuck for something say, start quoting one of them. But I don't know what they be saying. I take solace in something Maya Angelou once said. "We cannot repair what we cannot see. Our souls contain our destiny." Wait, didn't Beyoncè say something like that? Maybe, but it sounds like something Maya could have said, so you're gonna have to "Melania Trump" - the hell out of this situation. - Ah! No, you didn't! Yes, snatch from the best, 'cause let me tell you, you can't tell me she didn't copy off of Michelle. Oh, bitch took every line, all of it, the whole damn thing... Ladies, ladies, ladies, surprise, surprise. I have a feeling it's not. What are you doing here, Lucious? Well, my boy Giuseppe's just showing me around the spot. You know, Big Mike is getting out of the joint tomorrow night, so we decided to throw a nice little celebratory party, take over the rest of the establishment. I hope their rowdy asses ain't too much for Angelo's highfalutin mama. As soon as I say the name Lyon, the place is miraculously booked tomorrow night. Le... Le Cirque has the patio open. Patio? I am not trying to sit and dig gnats out of my teeth all night. No. Hang up. It's over. We'll never find a place in time. Lucious has eyes, ears and tentacles everywhere. I'm just gonna call Angelo and tell him it's over. Tell him his mama was right about me. Maybe I'm not about that life. If his mama was right, was our daddy wrong? Cookie gon' be a star. Cookie gon' marry a president. Cookie gon' be president. Come on, do this for Daddy. Loretha, we had plans. Howard. Maybe medical school. I have an idea. What? You should do the dinner here. Mm-hmm. I practically have penises hanging on the walls. That's not how you hold your baby. You don't hold her in a headlock. You got to hold her with her head close to your chest so she can hear your heartbeat. Mom said that's how you hold a baby. Your mama's country. She ain't held a baby since your were a baby. Look, um, you're gonna have to watch Bella for a couple hours for me tonight. What? Me and Bella alone? You got this. Look, I have no idea where Anika went to, but I know you can handle the baby even though your mama think you still a boy. I'm supposed to go to Mom's tonight. You'll get there. Run into a tight spot, just... yell for Juanita. Yeah, I got to go finish getting ready. We got this. Okay, guys, when y'all done rolling that up, make sure y'all take it in there somewhere. Be careful with that. Where they going with my leopard chairs? To storage. Diana Dubois is on the board of PETA. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals? Yeah, well, I know what the hell it means. You better go back there and get those fur coats from out of there, 'cause she gonna snatch her own edges out when she find those. Porsha, we need some more silk pillows. Alexa, will you add yellow silk pillows to my shopping cart. Nice ones. Sure, yellow silk pillows are now in your cart. Can you ask Alexa to get the dumbasses back up here? They hung my picture wrong. Hey, guys, come on back, 'cause it's not right, it's crooked, and she don't like it like that. Okay, three forks? What you need - the third one for? - Jackie O had three. Michelle O had three. Cookie Holloway Lyon Dubois... shall have three. Okay, whatever. Uh, Porsha, come back here and help me. Alexa, can you help me find a new job? Little girl, you got to chill. Where the hell'd they go? Here, you take her. Mm-mmm. I'm good. I possess none of those skills. Look, look, you could... you could call Shine. What? He raised Nessa, didn't he? Why you such a no-good-idea-having fool? But you giving me a good idea. I'm-a call Jamal. He did have a baby for, like, - two seconds. - See? You see how that work? I'm-a... I'm-a go to the kitchen. You need something? - Breast milk. - All right. I got you. You're special, Loretha. You're the one. You put too much on me, Dad. I put everything on you. You got this, Cookie. - Hey! - Hey, Ma. I'm not late, am I? I'm right on time, right? That's fine. All right, look, I was working on your song. It's your song, It's-it's everything, it's raw, it's real, it's so... it's dope. Okay, I can't wait to hear the song. Why you got shades on? Boy, are you high? No. Ma, it's from the new meds. Come on. It makes my face a little, I don't know, my eyes sensitive. Well, does it make your brain stupid, huh? Jamal, you know how important this night is for me. Why would you start new meds tonight? Mommy... you're nervous, and I understand. But you don't need to be. I'm good, okay? I swear. Yo, your place is perfect. This place is dope. - Please... - Don't worry about nothing. Jesus, please stop me from killing my child tonight. Aah! God! Boy, go put some water on your face. - Get it together! - A'ight! Yeah, yeah, a'ight. Stupid! - Hello. - Hey. - Come in. - All right. Here we go. - You look gorgeous. - Thank you. So, please allow me to introduce you to my mother. Mother, this is Cookie. - Cookie, this is Diana. Mm. - Very nice to meet you. Lovely decor, Cookie. Thank you. But really, you shouldn't have. - Mother... - I-I shouldn't have? No, you didn't have to redo your entire place just to impress me. I do adore Mondrian, though. I, for one, do not even want to know you if you do not love Mondrian. Mrs. Dubois, you are everything. My name is Jamal. - Hey... What... - Oh. She smell good. - This is my son Jamal. - She's incredible. Jamal, come here, why don't you make yourself useful? Here, here, boy. Best to shut your mouth. Oh, yeah. That's, um... - Mom... - That's my middle son - uh, he-he's a free spirit. - Mm-hmm. One in every family. Uh, no, there isn't, Mother, but if-if there were more Jamals around, the-the world would be a better place. That's for sure. Yes. Don't try too hard honey, it'll backfire in your face. Uh... well, I can't wait till you meet my eldest son. Andre. He should be here in a minute. - He went to... he went to Penn. - He went to Penn. Yes, so you'll have a lot to talk about. - Very intelligent. - And my baby, Hakeem. We are so proud of him. So, Hakeem talking about he can't come. 'Cause he's talking about he's all the way at home by himself. Get the door. Get the door. Can't pick up the phone, dummy. Uh... Hakeem. Hey, Mom. Hakeem... ...what the hell is going on? Give her to me, give her to me. Look, I don't want to hear it. You were right. Can you just please make her stop crying? - Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh... - What's up? Hey, Hakeem, this is my mother.
