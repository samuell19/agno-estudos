Hello. Were you working? No. I was dreaming I was asleep. Ha ha. How ugly men are when they're sweating! The sun's really beating down out there. In winter, when you need it, ifs gone! Funny! Him! Hi... Marceline and I are going to the Loire chateaux. I've got 2000 francs and a car that seats three. You'll be able to relax. So we're taking you. Impossible. Because? Because? Because...? Of this. Here, have a look. -Oh. -That is the sum of my riches. You mean you're worth 20 francs? -Very funny. -So what do you mean? I've always got small change, but never any big notes. Do you know how much I've earned this year as a lawyer? -Guess. I don't know. How much? 875 francs. -No! -Yes! -I don't understand. -Me neither. That beard scares clients off. You wok like a satyr ready to pounce. I preferred you dean-shaven. I let It grow to give me more authority. I kicked too young. I wanted clients to take me seriously. But clients stay at home in this heat. When was the last one? What? Your last client. My last client... 8 months and 3 days ago. We were in court on the 14th Then he got sentenced... I won't see him for 3 years. So why don't you get this shaved off? Anyway, I can't come with you. Although I really could do with a holiday. It's July! Everyone's on holiday! And you're staying here in Paris with the court empty, trying to get scraps from the last few clients with their stupid little cases. All because you haven't made it work. Think of what you're missing: the chateaux, the Loire, Vouvray, the car... I thought you played in “Pan sur la marquise“ at the Nouveautés theatre? I was playing the left breast, a character study. But we're taking a break. Would you ever oblige me by opening the door? May I ask why? To get some air in here. We're suffocating! You should have said so. Mr. Antonio Roze? Yes, Sin May I come in? Just a second, please. It's a... It's a client. -What? -A client. -A client? -Shush! Shush. Hm... Good, well, Mr. Role, Let me thank you for your excellent counsel, and congratulate yo for the magnificent defence. Good bye, Sir, and enjoy your holidays. Thank you, Madam. Sir, I have come on behalf of Sir Archibald Scarlett, Baronet. His manservant, named Durin, was silly enough to steal a valuable tiepin from him. Now he's at the Santé prison, I've come to ask, on behalf of the Baronet, to take on the defence of this poor young man. In a moment of anger, the Baronet pressed charges, which he now regrets. I'm sure, Sir, that you won't refuse to us your considerable talents to serve this minor cause. Very well, I'll accept this case however trifling it may be. The Baronet has asked me to give you 2000 francs as a downpayment. Please thank the Baronet. Durin, wing 3, Santé, Paris. Antonio Roze. Durin, Sir. I've had a look at your file. No previous convictions and good character references. You were in the service of Lord Archibald Scarlett. Yes, Sir Husband of Lady Helena Scarlett. Yes, Sir -You stole a pin. - I did. -That was foolish. -It was. You won't be before a Judge for at least 2 months. No, Sin Why did you wait for the holidays? Trying to be clever? No, Sir. Oh, don't start crying. It won't get you anywhere. You haven't been sentenced yet. This is the first time I have lost my honour. I'm not used to so doing. Thank you, Sir. You're crying a river, here. Why all the tears? You'll get off with a suspended sentence. Promised. It's not about me. How will Madame manage now, without me? There you go. She was so reliant on me. Who is Madame? Helena Scarlett. She had charged me with a private marten And... ? And I got stopped before I could complete it. And... ? Madame must be suck with worry, I can just see her. She'll find someone else. But I was in her home, loyal as can be. This is bad. Now, come on... She's so proud, she'll kill herself. There you go! What, kill herself? And when the Baronet hears about that, he might die on the spot There you go. Now, what's all of this about? That's a professional secret Listen... if Madame kills herself, I'll kill myself. Then there'll be no trial. A win for you. Tell me... Please leave me, Sir. Listen, Durin, you can trust me, I'm your lawyer. Well, that's it... No, I can't. I can't. If she's threatening to kill herself you must not keep extent. I could do something to stop her. You can't. It's already too late. Let's try. It's worth a try. Lady Helena charged me with ...knowing how devoted to her I am, Come on, out with it. She asked me to go to a secret location and pickup a sealed envelope and a suitcase. It would seem that her whole life, everything, hangs on this envelope and the suitcase. It was probably a love story, a matter she takes to heart, in any case. I can still hear her saying Achille - she calls me Achille - , Achille, go to number 7, Rue Chalgrin. If they ask who you are, say that you are there on behalf of Mr. Van Housen. Here's the key to the door, left on the mezzanine. Here's another key. The lock is hidden by the tassels on the yellow sofa. Inside the sofa, you will find the suitcase and the envelope Bring it all to me by the 6th - the 6th, she said. "If you don't bring it by the 6th“, she said, "I shall disappear for ever!" There you go. the 6th, and it's already the 4th, and I'm in prison! That means no less than a death sentence for Madame. No, my professional ethics forbid me... even if a woman's life is at stake, no. 7 Rue Chalgrin. Mezzanine, to the Weft. Thank you. Did it go well, Sir? For you, Yes- I shall never forget what you've done for her. -If you ever need... -Enough games. -Sir... -I opened the case. How annoying. I know who you are. Curiosity killed the cat. What I saw has opened my eyes. You can't see with your eyes closed. -You're Mister Flow! -Keep your voice down. -You're... -Quiet, the next cell is occupied. You're Mister Flow, international bandit. Charming! Like in the papers: international bandit. You talk We a second-rate hack. Wanted by police the world over. It's a small world. A professional bank-robber. Why would you think that bank safes are my specialism? Oh yes, France is the country where artists are all given labels. Of course I like banks, but I can forge signatures, too. Literary critics call it pastiche. I know. Then there's the necklace stolen in Monte Canoe And the Rembrandt I swiped in Amsterdam. And the casino at Juan les Pins. And the safe at Southampton. -I shall see justice done to you. -No. I shall tell the truth. No-one will believe you. We'll be sent down together. -I shall return the case. -Impossible. May I? -Using the alias Van Housen, Mr. Flow was spotted yesterday on Rue Chalgrin. He was sporting a smart black beard; the concierge recognised him. -Well? -This IS dreadful. Don't let your guard drop, Sir. You told the concierge to say that to the police? You can't return the suitcase to the Rue Chalgrain. Nor can I go anywhere else. I'll be arrested. No you won't. Oh, I wish I were far away. -Like Deauville? -What? Deauville. You've got to disappear, it's in our interest. Our interest? Yes. When you get home, you'll find an envelope with 4000 real francs. Fine, Durin. Tomorrow morning, once you've renewed your wardrobe, you'll leave for Deauville. You will pass on the suitcase and envelope to Helena Scarlett. -No, Durin! -Would you rather keep it at home? Go to the Hotel Royal. -Yes. -Introduce yourself as Mr. Prim. No, Durin! Yes, Antonio. I really advise you to shave off the beard: the concierge at Rue Chalgrin described it quite precisely. Get my beard shaved off? I wouldn't hesitate. Both for aesthetical and legal reasons - I'd get rid of it if I were you, and soon. Very well. Since I get bored on my own and I need to stay in touch with the outside world, Merlow will be visiting while you are away. Everyone thinks he us your secretary. He's got a doctorate in law, is from an excellent family. Habla espanol. Speaks English. Who is Merlow? Isn't he Lord Scarlett's messenger? Deary. Listen, after my trip to Deauville, Swear I'll have nothing more to do with this, right? I swear, Antonio. -Really? -On my honour. No, leave it. May I help, sir? Lady Helena Scarlett, please. Is it Mr. Prim? It's... Yes. Room 123? Mr. Prim is at reception. Mr. Prim is there? One moment. It's Antonio Roze. Intelligent? He's young. Not bad for starters. Do what you want with him Good. Send Mr. Prim up. very well, Madame. Take this gentleman to 123. May I? No, leave off! Oh, Mr. Prim, how delightful! -Madam, I... -But of course. You haven't changed at all in 2 years, I've missed you so! I've missed your eyes, your lips, your kisses. Turn around. As slender as ever. May I call you Lawrence, like in Milan. Like in Milan? And in Berlin, in London. I've often reminisced about that night at the Dorchester. You covered me in orchids. And this song we loved so much, don't you remember? I'm afraid I'm baffled... You've always been baffled, dear Lawrence. Is that your luggage? No, this is the suitcase from Durin. Who's Durin? The manservant. -Ah, Achille! -Achille? We all call him Achille. Why are you bringing it? Well, Madam, Durin, or rather Achille, asked his lawyer, who is a friend of mine, to bring you thus suitcase and this envelope. Lawrence, you recommended us a very bad servant. I don't understand. We hired him in Algiers on your recommendation. My husband has been very kind. Achille stole a silly trinket. My husband's forgiven him. I haven't. I'll keep the suitcase since he told you to leave it with me. Dear Lawrence, fun-loving, fickle, frivolous Lawrence. Just like back then. I'll have a drag of your cigarette to read your mind. No? Is that what you're thinking? Already? You deserved that Where are you staying? Here? I'm sorry, Madam, I'm taking the train back tonight. So you only came for Achille. Come come.. Enough of your come come! Always the same! You won't go back tonight. Tomorrow, the day after, not tonight! You won't do that to me. Ricordati, Caro. Ricordati Costantinopoli. Ricordati. No, Madam. Deny it, go ahead. At least there were witnesses. Denying it... That's the last straw. Hello? A suite for Mr. Prim. What? 500 francs a day? Yes, yes. -Where is your luggage? -In the car. Fine. Bring up his luggage. -Listen... -See you at 9pm in the casino. The Baronet's in Scotland, but we still have his table.

Good evening! Excuse me? Mr. Benett says Good evening. He still hasn't learned any French. No. He has enough difficulty with his native language. Could you tell me exactly where he comes from? Mr. Benett is Dutch, but grew up in China, where he was raised by a Javanese governess. I beg your pardon? He repeats his invitation. He'll soon be leaving on a cruise, and would be delighted if you would join his party. Tell him that I'll enjoy thinking about it. 130,000 francs, 65,000 francs per deal. All bets are in.

Benett, a multi-millionaire. Looks the part. He doesn't may. No, that's why he's a multi-millionaire. -With a magnificent yacht! -Looks like an asshat. -Any chips left? -Very few. Shame. Let's go dine. -And then? -Then we'll see. Helena, there can be no mistake: I'm happy. I know it's too good to last, but I'm happy. If I wanted to, I'd fall in love with you. -If you wanted to? -I'm holding myself back, but I can feel myself failing. You're laughing in my face; I'll look like a fool. But I don't care - nobody's watching. You look like someone with a case of vertigo. -Oh, my bracelet! -What about your bracelet? -I've lost it. -At the casino? No, I lost 100,000 francs there. The bracelet's here. -We'll find it. -Look around here. I'll let you know if I find shining couplets. I'll look over there. Well? I was afraid; he'd almost won 100,000 francs. Oh, that's bad. But I made him lose them straight away. -Lawrence! -What do you think of him? He's adorable - and he'll believe whatever we want him to. You can tell Durin that it'll be fine. Lawrence. Have you found it? Lawrence. I've got it! I've found it. I'm attached to it. Not because of its cost; it's a memento. -Of love? -No, first communion. -May I have a cigarette? -Yes. Helena. I know. Me too. You're already in love with me? Hmm. Why is that a surprise? Venice, Milan... Our Dorchester! Does all that count for nothing? I'm a different man this evening. Let's see if your lips have changed. Lawrence.“ Helena, listen.“ I don't know who I remind you of but I want to Wove and beloved for who I am. Helena, I'm not who you think I am. -I'm... -I know. Idiot. She loves me, here's why The sky is blue.“ She loves me, here's why... Badaboum! Eau de Cologne, eau de Cologne What use is it being French when you're in Cologne? I'm in love! In love! Come in. Come in! Come on in, ladies and gents! We've still got some good seats left inside! Oh! Come in, for pity's sake! Ah, it's Mr. Maki. Good morning, Mr. Maki. What have you for me? Thank you. Not very talkative this morning, are we? Mr dear, I enclose a kiss - don't lose it. Maki will now be at your service. He is the most discreet man I know. He us deaf and dumb. Get up quickly! I'm waiting for you. I love you in every language, including Swedish and Norwegian. Kisses. Respectfully yours, Helena. What's this? No, you leave that alone. Good morning. Good morning, Helena. Would it be indiscreet to ask you a question? No. How did this suitcase get into my room? I thought it was safer in your room than in mine. Hmm. Do you know what's in it? No, I haven't been curious enough to open it. I opened it. Do you know what that us? No, but its delightful. It's a state-of-the-art burglar's kit with a photo of me. -A photo of you? -Of me. -Why of you? -That's what I'm wondering. And do you know who Durin is? He's Achille. Durin is a common law criminal. -No? -He is, my dear. -Oh... -Right? -Oh dear! -Yes. -Him? -Yes, my lady. No... Durin is none other than the famous Mr. Flow. No? Can that petty criminal Durin really be the big Mister Flow? Yes, he is. Oh, my dear, don't leave me! I suddenly feel so alone, so vulnerable. And my poor old husband is in Scotland. Stay! If you want me to stay, stop signing your letters -with "Respectfully yours". -Please stay. Durin, Mister Flow: quite extraordinary. You've never noticed anything odd? No, never. Servants are staff. They all look the same. -Hmm. -Let's forget about that, shall we? This evening, we'll go out. Would you like to? But just promise me one thing. Swear to me that you won't play at roulette or baccarat with your last few 1000 franc notes. Don't tempt fate. Swear to me. -I swear. -On what? -On your head. -Thank you. That's a pretty dress. I'll wear it tonight. You in your tuxedo, me in this. We'll make quite the couple. To thunk that I wanted to go back yesterday... You drive me crazy, you know? I love you. It's awful. Oh? Awful. I wasn't at all ready for love. And yet if you left me, I think I'd feel like the ash of a cold cigar -Oh... -A bit hammy, I know. No... You're a child, that's all. But don't worry: you're a very precocious child. -Hmm. -Hmm. Hello hello! You look stunning. How pretty. “In the light of this lovely evening let me tell you again of my hopes" "Thank you for this red rose which chases my gloomy thoughts". -Here, watch this. -Hmm... Fine. Gin. Raspberry. Helena. Helena. You've had a few, eh? No, not too many. Well, yes. I've had... I've drunk enough to tell you a few things that are difficult to explain. To explain. Helena, listen carefully. -Oops... -Yes, of course. Helena. Here... Helena, I am”. very, very, very. Very, very, very what? Very upset. You remember that 100,000 francs I had, that you bet and that we Vast? Yes, the memory's all that's left of them. Here's the thing: I want you to... to give me that money back. To give me some of it back. Oh, not much. It's because. Because? Because... Oops... What? -Lost. -You played? I'm broke. Yet you swore on my head! -Yes. -Marie. -Marie. -No! Welk Marie. Help me undress; I shan't he going out. Good job I didn't swear on your legs. Thank you. But I have your head. A head with pretty legs. You're legs with a pretty head Why does your head have legs? Why do your legs have a head? Shut up, would you? Alright. Betting your last few notes regardless of what I said! I drank to forget what was sad. Now we're broke. I've already borrowed from everyone. I owe Marie 10000 francs. I've got an idea. What if you wired Sir Archibald Scarlett? He won't send a penny. He's generous, but he won't pay. Maki runs it all. We can't go to the casino with Maki, that would be ridiculous. I've had enough! Enough! Have you quite finished playing now? And I thought I'd found a pleasant, honest man. But I get this! An inveterate gambler who breaks the first promise he makes. Promising! I'm leaving. Good bye. -Helena! -What? That's Durin's suitcase. Oh... you're right. It's your fault. You're putting me into such a state. Have a sip. It'll calm you down Hmm? I will. Cheers. To you. Thanks. What are we going to do? Hmm? Those are very fine toms. Aren't they just? Burglars have made at a lot of progress. -Are they made of silver? -No. Solid steel. Oh, here's an idea. -We'll play burglars. -Burglars? We'll be like Arsene Lupin. What, both of us? I adore you. -I adore you more. -well, let's do it. I know a deserted villa just waiting for us. And we've got everything we need. Let's go. You are the best at staving off boredom. And at least this is a cheap distraction. -Come on, it'll be fun. -Seriously, fun? -You'll see. -I'm worried. For the watchman if he gives you any trouble. No! Are you joking, Helena? No, I've thought of everything I thought you were only joking. Here's the lock. No, Helena, I forbid you. Did you hear me? Damn. I, personally, would rather not... -Come on. -Alright... Quietly. -My shoes make a noise. -Take them off. -What? -Take off your shoes. -I'm not an expert... -You'll learn. Taking off your shoes to learn a trade. Come on. It feels like I'm making a lot of noise. It's all I can hear. No, keep going. Damn. Can't you hear anything? No, not a peep. You're imagining it. I shall have to get used to it. Now, I'm going to teach you to work. Stay still and listen carefully. These are the tools you will need to crack open the drawers I will point out. This is a crowbar. Repeat after me. This is a crowbar. Repeat after me. These are lock-pickers. Repeat after me. These are lock-pickers. Repeat after me. Hook. Hook. Screwdriver, metal saw, brace and but. -Brace and what? -Bit. -Brace and bit. -Bravo, sweetie. Where did you learn all of thus? In the law department. -Law? -Law. Law. -What's that? -The watchman. The watchman barks? -Keep a hold of your cudgel. -My cudgel... But Helena... Helena. Come out of there. Dearest, would you come here? Here. Look how well he's breathing. He dropped right away, you know. This chap looks a bit fragile, if you ask me. Dearest, do you think I could put my shoes back on? My feet are getting cold. -Yes, you may. -Thank you. Would you hold that, my dear? -Afraid you'll cut yourself? -Yes. -Where are you going? -I'm going... May I? I hate putting my shoes on in front of a lady. I'll leave you two tete a tete. No, I just can't. Dearest, are you coming or not? Yes, my love. Hove you. Here you go. What are you doing? My Lord! Still not woken up? Hoppity-hop! And now, let's get down to work. Oh no. Oh yes! It's a Cézanne, probably worth 100,000 francs. No, Weave that alone. No, not the desk. It's probably empty. We'll just see about that. Dearest, to be a burglar, you must be a gentleman. We're burgling the place, not stopping in for tea. Burgling is not pillaging! No! Now -You vandal! -You haven't seen anything yet. Dearest, can't you see how boorish you're being? You'll never be invited again here. We've played enough games, don't you think? I'm very hungry. Are you hungry? -I'm thirsty. -We'll picnic in the kitchen. Would you be good a boy and put away the tools? Shame! I was starting to have fun. Ah... Whoops: Oh, no. Mr. Flow strikes again! Mr. Flow burgled Lord Scarlett's villa Mr. Flow has an accomplice. My trunk has been stolen! Oh, it's too much! He even had the audacity to leave a calling card. -Good morning, darling. -Are you making fun of me? What's wrong? The hotel was broken into last night. -What's all this about? -You know full well. Do you know who burgled the hotel? The same guy who broke into the Scarlett's villa, Mr. Flow. -Do you know who Mr. Flow is? -Durin. He's in prison. -It's you. -Are you mad? Me, mad? That's enough! Stop! I told you to stop! Drop that. What's all this then? Huh? Your calling card? You should be punished... -I can explain. -Enough lies. I get it: Mr. Flow gets identified and I'm an accomplice. -Be quiet, will you? -I will not! -There are people next door. - I don't care! Hello? What? A policeman? Yes, send him up. The police. Here's a great opportunity for you to turn me in. If you love me even one tenth as much as you say, you'll say you spent the night here, with me. So you confess? What does it matter? I love you; my life is at risk. One moment. Go on, send them in. Come in. Madam, Sir, forgive me for disturbing you, but I come with upsetting news. Madam, the notorious Mr. Flow broke into your villa last night. No? I'm afraid so. Would you come to my office at 3pm thus afternoon. Should I wire my husband? He does not need to be present to report a burglary. Sir, Madam. Delighted to have met you as part of thus adventure. Oh, Madam, this is no adventure for me, just part of clay-to-day, grinding police work. Theft, theft, and then more theft I spend my life chasing scoundrels. Good day, Madam. Look, I almost missed a piece of evidence. Our thief was also here at the hotel And signed for his handiwork. Odd pattern of thought. Gentlemen. Hang on... Before you burn the evidence, tell me a few things, you! Who is Durin? You know: he's Mr. Flow. No, enough. You've messed me about enough. I'm an imbecile. A child of 6 would have behaved less foolishly than me. -You've compromised me... -No, I've compromised Mr. Prim. Antonio Roze is innocent? Very subtle for the President of the Criminal Court. Stop circling, it's making me sea-sick. Who is Mr. Flow? It's Durin, for the last time! Durin, my lover. What? Yes. He's kept me for 6 years. I've been in on all his adventures. He organised my marriage to Sir Archibald Scarlett. Not bad. And your poor husband? What's his role in all this? Durin coveted his fortune. Happy now? Oh, I'm delighted, ecstatic! He got himself caught for a tiepin? It was all premeditated. He was going to be exposed by my brother-in-law, Philip Scarlett. He was always hostile to the marriage. And to Durin He was going to identify Durin, who saw the danger. And so to muddle things up, he came up with this pin story. Well, you do like to keep things simple... And what am I doing in all this? And that photo of me? Because you look like Mr. Prim, one of Mr. Flow's impersonations. Yes. It's all becoming clearer now. As clear as mud, so visible it's blinding. A 6-year-old could understand it. Well I feel like a 5-year-old. Have you got an aspirin? My brain is about to shut down. While Durin is locked up, Prim operates outside. Well, look at him now: Mr. Prim just died. I'm going back to my own identity. I want to be loved for being me. You dirty little tart! When you arrived, I had planned to use you, like Mr. Flow uses me. You don't have to believe me, but I fell foul of my own traps. This happens. A likely story!! No, I mean it. I'm telling the truth because I told you I lied. Darling, let's run off together, forget Mr. Flow and just live our lives. You do still love me a bit, don't you? Of course I love you. I'd have left a couple of hours ago if I didn't. I'm a complete jackass. If I could stop loving you for just 10 minutes, I'd give you such a slapping. Realm Well, more like a quarter of an hour. Now I'm a member of a criminal gang! No you're not! We're not a gang. There's only three of us, no more. Mr. Flow, the cripple, and me. I needed you as an alibi, darling. But all that's over now. Over. We can't leave without money. Did you know that every evening, Maki takes off my jewellery. On Sir Archibald's orders. He puts it in safe in his room. Tonight, you can break into that safe. We'll sell the jewels and run off with the money. See, darling, I'm thinking of you. Here we go again! It's my jewellery. Can't you take care of your own dirty work? No, I must remain beyond suspicion. No thanks. This is the last sacrifice I'll ask of you. There's no risk. Yes, I remember. Maki is deaf and dumb, isn't he? There he comes, the imbecile. He really gets on my nerves, looks like a cockroach. I'd like to show you how much I trust you. Maki, would you say a few words? Always at your service, Madame. See? only you, Durin, and I know that Maki has all his senses. Maki was sent by my brother-in-law to spy on me. One day, I caught him on the telephone. Now, I'm paying him to pretend to be monitoring me. Get it? Elementary! Now, listen up: Tonight, between 11.30 and midnight, you go into Maki's room. The safe is in the wall, behind the chest of drawers. The number is 3, 6, 7. 3. 6. 7. Quite a job you gave me. When are we leaving? -The day after tomorrow. -Why not tonight? We've got to keep calm. Maki must not suspect a thing. Maki. Give me my pearls. We're going out. That is where you're keeping my pearls now? Since the burglary I'm being more careful. The case might get stolen, my lady. Hmm.“ Benett has invited ail the guests onto his yacht. He's cleared out the hotel. -What a silly idea. -No, an excellent idea. After the rooms were broken into, He thought that, by inviting everybody aboard, he'd be able to identify Mr. Flow. He's even hired two detectives. He won't return to Deauville until Mr. Flow has been unmasked. -Well? -Well, the case was empty. Nice work. And Helena ? On a cruise, with Francesco Benett, a millionaire. Put away that money, you're annoying me. What do you think? Well... Don't you have the impression that Helena may have developed a liking for Antonio Roze which wasn't part of the plan? I don't have any impressions at all. This cruise must be cut short, and Helena must understand that I won't let her go until she has delivered me Lord Scarlett's fortune. I didn't have her married simply to live the high life. She is to return within 48 hours. Do you understand? You're getting on my nerves! Do you know this man? A.R. His name's Lawrence Prim. LP. Curious. Would you tell M. Benett that our research is centering on a certain Mr. Lawrence Prim 7 Very well. Lawrence Prim. Excuse me, Madam. Oh, excuse me, Sir. What is it? Mr. Benett is distraught: he has just received a message, to return immediately. The cruise is over. We shall have to tell everyone. I'm sorry. Mr. Benett is sorry. -Did you hear that? -Mmm. The cruise is over, we must return to Deauville. It was going too well wasn't it? It couldn't last; we were too happy. -Really, you were happy? -Yes. Perhaps for the first time. I have just discovered a peaceful kind of happiness. 9 of diamonds: a journey. How will you get off the boat? You're being watched. Do you think the police will be there? We should expect the worst. -I've got an idea... -Oh, 10 of spades. Trouble. Damn. Prim has disappeared. -Prim? -Yes. I've looked everywhere. He's flown off. -Flown off? -I questioned Lady Scarlett, She seemed distressed by the disappearance. Prim can't have gone far I've seen Mr. Flow. And... ? -He's furious. -Why? What are you doing? Where were vow I was waiting for you. Well, you came close to waiting a lot longer. What a journey! I should never have listened to you. I should never have run away from that yacht. I've incriminated myself. No, Mr. Prim is under suspicion, not Antonio Roze. Yes, I get it! Prim is a bastard, Antonin's a saint. But Prim is Antonio, Antonio is Prim. Whether I'm a bastard or a saint, they're on to me. Not for long. Grow your beard, no-one will recognise you. I shaved it off because it incriminated me, and now I've got to let it grow back? Oh, deary me.“ Ah, not you too! What not me too? Not you, that's all. You're not going to start talking like Mr. Flow, are you? All these Flow people are starting to get on my nerves. Mr. Flow and Lady Flow, and the whole Flow family! Well, you seem nervous, dean Enough of your dears, too, enough of this act, of your wooden charm. -What? -Enough. I don't understand. -You do. I've had enough of stealing from villas you own, of stealing empty safes, of mock robberies. -Mock? -Mock! You'd rather steal for real? -What's my part in all this? -What? -What is my part In all thus? -Oh... Just to get away from the police, I have to swim, drive cars, go running. I have to be an alibi while Madam plunders hotel rooms! Now now, my love. Have you finished making fun of me? You'd better change the way you talk to me, Mister! -No. -Yes. -No. -Yes. You're staying here until you've grown a beard. Here's the canned food. -I don't like cans. -We've got Champagne. -I don't like Champagne. -But you'll have to eat! -No! -Yes! -Do me a favour and leave. -I will not. -Leave! -No! -You, refusing to run away? -I'm staying. -You're going. -No. -Yes. -You're getting on my nerves! -Ouch! Well, that's one thing you won't have stolen, at least. -You didn't just... -Take that! Oh, you.“ I hate you. I despise you. Yes, from head to toe. When I think that Durin accuses us of being in love... -No? -Yes. -Haha! -No? Yes. He'll be surprised to see us. The Judge has been quite helpful bending the rules. He refused Antonio Roze a visiting clearance but he gave one to Lady Helena Scarlett. He here is. Good day, Sir. Good day, Durin. Did Madame have a nice holiday? Very nice, Durin. I take it Mr. Antonio Roze also enjoyed his holiday? Just as much as Lady Helena. I'm very happy for Madame. Time must pass slowly here, my dear Durin. Yes, I am anxious to return to Madame's service, and to never leave her for a second, like before. I'm afraid I won't be able to take you back, Durin. I'll give you an excellent reference, of course. Madame knows I didn't take the pin for my own use, as I only wear bowties. I advised Lady Helena to let you go. But we shall recommend you to friends. Yes, we'll take care of him. Madame will reconsider. Don't bank on it, my poor Durin. Don't get your hopes up for nothing. Oh, if only you knew how mediocre this silly little story of yours has seemed to me this summer. It's very amusing to listen to you counting your change. I'm sorry, but I have a meeting at 4pm. Goodbye Durin. Goodbye, Sir. Madam. Sin This was my last visit; we'll see each other in court. Sir will perhaps see me again before it. I doubt It. I've got so much on, so many cases. One day, I'd like to have Mr. Flow as a client. Goodbye, my poor Durin. I doubt I'll be able to come. Antonio Roze will read out my statement. Antonio Roze and me are one and the same. Goodbye, Durin. Goodbye, Madame. Goodbye, Sir. Goodbye, Durin. When are we up? Very soon. Lots of cases will be thrown out. Good day. You haven't looked so nice since your husband died. Stop talking about the Baronet's death, would you? You've never looked as nice. Thank you. -Enjoyed your holidays? -Greatly, thanks. -Do you think he'll be acquitted? -He'll be released this evening. Unless something else happens. -Don't expect any miracles. -You never know. If only we had a few weeks to get ourselves sorted. Hello there, my lad! Hello there, you alright? -Oh, it's Philip! -Who's Philip? My brother-in-law. What's he doing here? We've got to say hello to prove we're not afraid. Good day, Philip. Good day, Héléna. -Antonio Roze, Sir Philip Scarlett. -Good day, Sir. Have you come from London? I arrived this morning. You look lovely. An important day, isn't it? Oh, a stolen pin It is a big day, you'll see. -Are you testifying? -No, I'm interested in the trial. Very interested, in fact. Funny man, this Durin, isn't he? A poor creature. Hmm, who knows? I shall leave you with your lawyer. He's not my lawyer, he's Durin's. I thought he was going to defend you. -Against what? -Circumstances... Explain your actions, Durin. Why did you take that tie pin? Er... I... Speak! I... I must ask the bench to excuse my client's timidity. It us his fist time as a defendant. Let him explain! Your honour, I have no defence. I cannot explain what I did. There us no explanation. There you go. I am sorry, that's all. Especially since Lord Scarlett died in such sad circumstances. There you go. Shot himself with a hunting rifle. Like a rabbit. Back to the case. Which case? What do you mean which case? The pin you stole! Oh yes. But what is that against Lord Scarlett's death? Poor Lord Scarlett. Hiked him and. And.“ There you go. Yes. That's what I wanted to say. We've understood. He's a pinhead. And a birdbrain. It's a clear-cut case, he doesn't deny the charge. No witnesses? I've refrained from calling them. Perfect. Make your plea. Your honour, I won't stretch the patience of the court with such a childish theft carried out with such disarming innocence. What is at stake? A tiepin. I shan't plead a case about something so trifling. Who is Durin? Excuse my interruption, counsel: I request that the president use his discretionary power to call this witness. Bring in the witness. Your full name? Philip Scarlett. -Age? -58. -Place of residence? -London. Do you swear to tell the truth, and nothing but the truth? -Raise your right hand. -I swear. Lower your hand. The court is listening. Gentlemen, I would not bother the court about a minor theft of jewelery by an inoffensive servant. That's not what I'm here for Gentlemen, for years new police forces across the world have been searching, in vain, for an international scoundrel, Mr. Flow. And yet this untraceable Mr. Flow is here, in this very room. There. It is him: Durin. Silence! Silence, or I'll have the court cleared. Sir; I'm surprised you've waited so long to make such a sensational claim. I take it you have not only accusations, but proof? This is a bad joke. The proof that Durin is no other than Mr. Flow, is thus: I shall make use of my right to call witnesses. -May I? -Go ahead. Thank you. Gentlemen, Durin... Always at your service. Silence! Silence at the back! Enough down there! Speak, Sin Gentlemen, Durin was recommended to my poor brother by one Mr. Prim. From the moment Durin entered into his service, this Mr. Prim disappeared. You should note that Durin and Mr. Prim were never in the same place at the same time. In fact, Durin and Prim are one and the same. Prim is a talented at disguising himself, something that police everywhere say of Mr. Flow, too. This is no statement, but rather a Chinese puzzle. According to you, Sir; Prim and Durin are the same person. Yes, and Mr. Prim is none other Than one of the many identities of Mr. Flow. In short. Mr Prim recommended Lord Scarlett a servant named Durin who was none other than Mr. Flow. Mr. Flow himself being Mr. Prim, a.k.a... Durin. Why of course! It's easy as ABC! Sir Philip Scarlett has come from London to tell us a mariner's yarn. Durin, do you wish to repudiate this? No, your honour But before serving the Baron, I held other positions. I've references, some in the file. There you go. And if I were Mr. Flow, I wouldn't be here, given that I wouldn't have got myself arrested for a tiepin. I were Mr. Flow, I'd be richer than Sir Philip, and given that, welt, apart from... Welt”. There you go. We understand. Silence! May I continue my statement? We've already heard enough of thus nonsense. And we have not had a shred of proof yet. Every time Lady Scarlett went away, whether to Rome, Bucharest, or London, Mr. Flow's scandalous activities would begin again. In fact, Lady Helena's location coincided with everyone of Mr. Flow's crimes. May I respond? Lady Helena Scarlett, whom I call as a witness. Please come to the bar. Your full name? Helena Winterfield Scarlett. Age? Mmm-ty five. Place of residence? London. If you swear to tell the truth, raise your right hand. I swear. Lower your hand. The court awaits your statement. 50 Sir Philip claims that Mr. Prim is none other than Mr. Flow? Quite. Well, at Deauville, Mr. Prim, whom I hadn't seen for 5 years, was at the Royal. So Mr. Prim was at Deauville? That's impossible. Inspector Gerber would tike to make a statement. Does the public prosecutor have anything against this? Quite to the contrary! At this point, one witness more or one less... Bring in the inspector Your full name? Francois Gerber. -Age? -43. -Place of residence? -Pans. If you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, raise your right hand. I swear Lower your hand. The court awaits your statement. I investigated, after the theft at the Royal in Deauville, and can say for certain that Prim is Mr. Flow. In my view, Durin has nothing to do with it. I've put my reputation on the line and intend to arrest Mr Prim. One thing which does seem surprising, however, is that Mr. Prim had a handkerchief with he initials A.R. Why are you laughing? Those are the same initials as my lawyer's. May I? Aren't they your initials, Sir? Your honour, that means absolutely nothing. Today, for example, I have a handkerchief with MA. Having forgotten mine this morning, my colleague Marcel Achour lent me his. One last thing which will prove the case. I will demonstrate the Mr. Prim is not the same person he was 5 years ago. I had Lady Helena watched. Me? Why? By whom? By Maki. Maki, you see, is neither deaf nor dumb. Oh.“ He was my special envoy to Lady Helena. Philip, you are a wicked man. I agree, your honour In the name of the defence, I deplore this action. -Haw dare you, Sir? -I do dare! I'm asking the court to respect the witnesses. For respectable witnesses. Counsel! Counsel! We shall want for this man, Maki, if he's here. Then we'll have heard everyone. Your full name? Tsugundo Maki. Age? 30. Place of residence? London. If you swear to tell the truth, raise your right hand. I swear. Lower your hand. Now, do you know Mr. Prim? Yes. Was he in Deauville? Yes. And he wasn't Mr. Durin. No, he was Mr. Prim. So even your spies can't prove your case, Philip. You were trying to get your brother to leave me out of the will. Slander! Oh! Your clumsiness gives me every reason to suspect the worst. Silence! I'm suspending this session! Durin, listen to me. The President of the Court is a charming fellow. His name is Désiré Ferréol. He lives at 215 boulevard Saint Germain. Danton 7591. A wealthy man, plenty of paintings. So? Nothing. In 15 minutes, I'll be a free man. Will you? Don't underestimate your talent. Don't overestimate the indulgence of the Court. In 15 minutes, I want you to come with Helena. We have some things to sort out. Take a good look at her, because tonight, me and her.“ Tonight, you are going far, far away - alone. I can't stand to be alone. -You will go. -Yes. -Alone. I'll spill the beans. I've been doing the maths. If I talk, you'll get at least 20 years, Helena 2. -No, 10. -2 with a good lawyer. 10 with a good prosecutor And you, Sir, have you nothing to lose in all of this? Yes, I'll get 6 months. You're worth more. 6 months is too low a price for someone of your value. I don't care. I'd rather see Helena alone in jail than outside with you. I don't give a damn! Do you hear me? This is about you and me. I intend to spend my life with Helena. How poetic! So you have to spend some more time inside. How generous! Find some way or other to get yourself sent down. Fast. If not, I'll ask to testify and grass you up. Grass me up. What an awful turn of phrase! I'm not joking, Durin. Do I look like I'm bluffing? I don't wish you ill, but you've threatened me and I'm responding. If you don't manage to stay inside, I'll tell the truth. An accused man doesn't try to stay in prison. I'm your client, Sir. I am defending Durin, but I can turn in Mr. Flow. Blackmail? Won't work on me. -It's a deal. -I don't do deals. -We'll see about that. -We will. Do excuse me, sir Your honours. The session is reopened. The Court has decided not take Sir Philip Scarlett's evidence into account The Public Prosecutor will press charges if appropriate. Counsel, you've made your case; I think we've heard everything. Your honour, I would like to add one word. A word and how many sentences? It's an admission. An admission? Yes... a confession. Please go ahead, Sir. Your Honour.“ What now? Your Honour, may I speak to Sir Antonio Roze? Yes, but hurry up: the Court has a lot of work today. Thank you, your Honour. My client would rather make the confession himself. Fine by me, but let's not waste any more time. I... Your Honour, I'm not who you think I am. It wasn't just a simple tiepin that} stole. There you go. No. Oh no, I've always stolen. Nothing big, though. This and that, knick-knacks. Pens, wallets, sunshades, jewelery, overcoats, bars of soap. There you go. I don't know if you understand? Very well indeed. I've stolen wherever I've worked, it's stronger than me. I have this urge to steal. Here, here, here... Everywhere. If I don't steal, I suffer. It's like a thirst. Your throat gets dry. So there you go: for me, stealing is quenching a thirst. I've been stealing since I was 6. On the day of my first communion, I stole the other children's rosaries. I had hoped I would stop one day, but I Just can't, so... I prefer to confess everything. I didn't want to confess, but the urge is too strong. There you go. You don't appear to be a very adept thief. What, me? Oh yes... Just a quarter of an hour ago, I stole this. My watch! Do you have anything to add, Counsel? No, your Honour. Given that the defendant has confessed to having stolen a tiepin and other objects belonging either to the plaintiff in whose service he was at the time or to third parties, this case falls under article 408 of the penal code. The defendant's sentenced to one year in prison. He'll serve at least the minimum sentence. Thank you, your Honour. Durin, we're even. What? What? My apartment has been broken into? They've found the calling card of Mr. Flow? Good grief! Well, well.. I suspend this session. I've caught a cold. Ah, one year ahead of us. One year to relax. What will we do? Dearest, our love got off scot-free, no suspended sentence. What is that in there? Tell me! No! -With compliments from Mr. Flow -There you go...
