[pages flipping] [Desert wind blows] [Music stinger] [Honks horn] Come on, Julie! It's party time! Ken Adams, I can't believe you! How many times have I told you: not here! C'mon, Julie... I wasn't gonna do anything! I just wanted to-- you know, cop a feel? That's so like you, Ken. Typical man! Come on, Julie. You're such a child sometimes. I'm a child? Listen to you... Mister "I Can't Get A Real Job 'Cause I'm Waiting To Be A Big-Time Filmmaker..." Low blow, Jules. What's wrong with wanting to create the ultimate in today's entertainment? Nothing's wrong with it... but why are you wasting your time trying to find work here when you can be on the next bus to Los Angeles? Jules, we've been through this before. If I leave now instead of waiting until we graduate, my mom's gonna disown me! I just gotta make it a few more weeks, that's all... and then you and I can get married and get on with the hanky-panky, eh? Is that all you ever think about? No, I think about movies too. Like the one I'm trying to get off the city? Now that one could put me on the map! Huh? I thought it was just a stupid video documentary on the history of Lake Tempe?! This could be my big opportunity, Julie! Besides, lots of filmmakers started out this way! Name one! Fine...George Romero started this way, by doing commercials and junk in Pittsburgh! George Romero? The guy that did the "Night of the Living Dead" garbage? Yeah, now there's a real art form... having dead people eat the flesh of the living and filming it! Julie, Romero is a filmmaking genius! He's my idea of a guy that's definately "made it"! Besides, he just doesn't do horror films... didn't you see the movie "Knightriders"? Is that that stupid thing about the guys on motorcycles... the one that's like two hours long? That is a great piece of cinema! Why, what would you like to see me do? Well, how about a movie like that one where the parents forget the kid at home and don't realize it until they've left for their vacation? That kid was so cute!! [Gags] You think my movies aren't lodged in reality? That movie sucked sheep-shit through a Crazy Straw! You didn't see it, remember? You insisted we go see that lame movie about the burned scientist in the bandages! Okay, okay, so that wasn't the greatest, but at least it was entertaining! Snap into reality, Jules! Me? Look at you: the hot-shot wanna-be filmmaker with your beater car that cost less than that car phone you just had to buy?! Hey, this thing puts me in touch with the world! [Phone rings] See? Good evening, Adams Productions! Hi ma. It's my mother again! What's that, ma? No shit? I know, I know... "There's no place for that language in this family." Mom...tell me what the guy said. They want me to shoot the documentary? That's awesome! Yeah, okay. [Laughs] Okay...um, I'll stop by a little later and pick up all the information, then. Okay, you take care. Bye-bye. I'm hired! I have a meeting down by the lake tomorrow morning! Congratulations, Cecil B. DeMille. Now where were we, baby? [Laughing] This is the journal of Doctor Fredericka O. Ray for Friday, March 13th. Today I made an amazing discovery. It appears that I have found the body of a humanoid creature that has washed ashore on Lake Erie. Apparently the creature -- which closely resembles a human -- made its way from the ocean to the Great Lakes. I believe that the creature may have originated from the city of Atlantis, although this could be seen as an early and unproven hunch. The creature doesn't appear to be alive, so this evening I shall attempt an autopsy. I believe that if I can retrieve some samples from the creature's innards, I can track the samples backwards and discover where the great city of Atlantis might once have existed. I had a great time tonight, Ken... even despite our argument. Hey...all good couples I know have arguments... that's what makes making up half the fun! Well, I better get inside. My dad's gonna give me the whole drill sergeant routine anyway... might as well face it now than later! Hey, why don't you come with me tomorrow morning? You'll get to meet the Mayor and see what this whole deal is about! Okay, I think I'd like that. Pick me up on your way there...I'll be ready! See you tomorrow morning! Bye, Julie... I love you! I love you too, Ken Adams! The creature... it's gone! It's gone..the find of the century and it's escaped! God help us if it gets hungry! [Zombie movie plays on TV] Hello? Uh, yeah, this is Ken Adams. Oh, hi... how you doin'? We still on for tomorrow then? Oh, the Mayor can't make it? I see...um... Oh, okay, he'll... He's gonna have somebody bring it over tomorrow then. Um...how about ten o'clock? Ten o'clock tomorrow morning, my place? Okay, okay...um... Oh, and make sure he brings the deposit check, too! Okay, yeah. Okay, um...I'll see you at ten, then! Okay, you take care. Bye-bye. This is impossible! I'll never get the humanoid back! I've worked so hard and had success on the tip of my fingers only to escape. Hmm...it's an aquatic creature. Although I didn't have much time to study it, I can only imagine it can have a limited existence out of the water. It's going to head for water, I do suspect. It's too far back to Lake Erie, so that only leaves two possibilities: the city reservoir or Lake Tempe. I'll go to the reservoir first. It's closer. God help me if that thing kills anyone! [Coughing] Man, this is some good shit! Be careful how much of that stuff you take in, dude. Once I sparked up this big cocksuckin' joint... and man, I saw Elvis! No shit man? Hey, would I shit you, dude? No way, man! Hey man...put that shit away, man! I just saw the Creature from the Blue Lagoon, man! I ain't never seen no shit like that before, man! Yeah, right. First you saw Elvis and now you're seein' the asanine Gill Man, bud! I'll tell you what your problem is, man... you been droppin' too much acid! Shit, man... it's back! [Monster growls] [Screaming in unison] Man, I'm layin' off this monster weed, man! Well, the reservoir was a nice waste of my time. That thing must be in the lake! No, not necessarily. Just because my depthometer didn't show any movement in the reservoir doesn't mean it's not there. This humanoid is the ultimate fish. It's lean, mean and fast. Probably too fast for my equipment to gauge accurately. I know...I'll go back to the lab. I think I may have an idea as to how I can lure the humanoid back to me. What's wrong, Ken? Oh, nothing. I just had the weirdest dream again last night. You wanna tell me about it? No, you'll think it's silly. Try me! Let's just say it's a "dog eat Ken" world out there and leave it at that. [Knock on door] There's the check! Money, money, money! Hey, how ya doin'? Ken Adams I presume? Yeah, that's me. Yeah, I'm with the Mayor's department... I'm here to drop off your check. Thank you... Well, you take care! I'll give you something that even Ellen Cabot couldn't give you! You take care, buddy! Be careful! Oh, check this out, baby! Now I'll be able to take you to all those nice places...oh, man. Oh...I can even get that copy of "Ghoul School" that I wanted! C'mon, let's go make our fellow Tempe-ans proud! Well, wait a minute... What, what? Let's record a moment of our own for the history books! Julie, it's just a check! I know, but it's your first check for one of your own productions! That makes you a real professional now! So, I see... so all those freebie weddings that I did were just for practice, right? Oh, c'mon, say "Cheese"! How about I say "Money" instead? C'mon... Cheese! [Cheesy music montage] Action! Oh, man...what a day! Yeah, I didn't know there was so much work involved in just filming a lake! Well, most people probably wouldn't have done so much coverage. I just wanted to make sure I had enough. Besides, they're payin' me some great cash for this, eh?! Oh, you're a hell of a guy, Ken Adams. Hey... that's Mister Adams to you! [Laughs] What's that? What's what? That!! Damn, that thing looks like something out of a bad B-movie! What's it doing? I dunno, but I've gotta get it on tape! Get your camera... take a picture of it! I can't... I'm out of film! You mean to tell me you shot all those stupid pictures of me working but you don't have any left over to shoot some sea creature? Um...sorry. Good thing I have this, then. What's wrong? The damn thing just disappeared! Figures! Dammit! Just wait...maybe it will come back! Yeah, in what lifetime? There! What the hell? It's like the damn thing knows what I'm doing! Just keep rolling... maybe it will show up again! Man, this sucks rocks! Just keep rolling, it'll come back! Yeah, on a cold day in Tempeville! It is kinda chilly today... Shaddap... It's back! Keep rolling! Why is it just sitting there? What would you prefer... it come after us? Ha-ha. Oh shit...I think you just pissed it off! Oh shit...let's get the hell outta here! Shit! Here, take it! What am I gonna do with this! Videotape that thing! Jesus! I don't want to videotape it! Shit!! Shit! Fucking keys... [Monster growls] [Car engine starts] No, Chester, no. Not much going on in town. Naw, not since we killed all the vampires and renamed the town. No, I don't suspect I'll see anything like that again. Yep...that was a once-in- a-lifetime experience. Sheriff! What in blazes has gotten into you kids? There's some creature down by the lake... ...and we've got it on tape! Yeah, Chester... I'm gonna have to let you go. Uh-huh. But sit tight... I may have some kinda nonsense headed in your direction. Bye-bye. Well, kids... what's the story? My name's Ken Adams, sir... I'm the filmmaker the city hired to shoot the documentary on the lake... Oh yeah...little Kenny Adams from Martin Street. How's your mom? Fine, sir...but listen. This thing came out of the lake and attacked us! What kinda creature we talkin' about, son? A big ugly son-of-a-bitch with a big scaly head and claws and... Woah, woah...that's not much to go on. Look, I've got it here, all on tape. Where's your VCR? Looks like one of them Betas. I've got VHS. Say, what happened to your camera? I knocked the monster out with it. Oh. Look...if you just come with me, I can show you what this is all about... Look...I don't have time to go around chasin' a monster I can't see. No...we knocked it out, it's still down on the beach! I'll have one of my men check it out. We'll get back to you if we have any questions. Don't worry Ken, I'll remember you. Fine! He's under a lot of stress right now. I understand. You kids have a good day. Here... No, you keep it. You broke the damn thing to begin with! I didn't mean to... that thing was going to kill you, I had to do something! Y'know, that's a really lame excuse, okay? Now I gotta go shoot all that crap over again... not to mention looking like a jerk in front of Sheriff Blake! Fine...act like a child! You're such a jerk! Julie...Julie, come back! Dammit!! "I'm sorry mom, I'm sorry!" "You better be sorry..." "Tomorrow night is Halloween, Jeffrey." "What our kind once celebrated with great ritual..." "...praising the dark god who blew the breath of life into our dead bodies." [Movie plays in background] "...not suspecting a kindly lady and her son, with their smiles and their decorations..." [Phone rings] Hello. Hi, Julie. Eh...I'm sorry, too. I mean, this whole thing's just stupid. Yeah, I love you, too. Listen, um...what? There is a good part on it? You fixed it? That's awesome! Listen, um...what was that guy Blake was talking about. Ray? Doctor Ray? OK, listen...um... Grab the tape, come on over. We'll check this out. Okay. Yeah, I love you too. Bye. [Knocks on door] Hi...Doctor Ray? Oh, you must be Ken Adams. Uh...this is my girlfriend Julie... I called you earlier? Oh, hi Julie. Why don't you guys come on in. Okay, thanks. Here, let's go into the kitchen. I really appreciate you seeing us like this. What seems to be the problem? Well, Julie and I are filming the documentary on the city's lake... and while we were down there, we ran into this creature of some sort. Creature? Yeah, it nearly killed us! That "creature" as you call it is the find of the century and if we don't find it within twenty-four hours it's going to die! How do you figure? The humanoid is the last survivor of the great city of Atlantis. and it can't survive without salt water. It's already been loose for at least twenty-four hours! What do I care? That thing almost killed Julie and I today! No, I doubt that it would have killed you... You see, that's what I thought at first. But then I received some test results this morning and it disproves that theory. Come again? The creature is not a meat-eater. It won't attack a human unless it's attacked first. See, it's very defensive of its own turf, much like other animals, but, you see... it's highly intelligent. The humanoid needs to take in a certain amount of salt water but it can only survive on one rare chemical. How rare? This chemical can only be found in one product known to man: toxic waste! Get outta here, you're puttin' me on! No I'm not. I thought the humanoid may have gone to the reservoir first, so I did check there. I did find traces of footprints, but you see, the water was just too clean... it couldn't find anything to eat, so I believe it may have gone to Lake Tempe. Well it attacked us today! How do you explain that one, doc? Yeah, what were you doing while you were attacked? You had mentioned something about a video? Yeah, we were trying to videotape it, but the damn thing kept screwing with us. Finally it just attacked! It's just as I thought. You see, Ken, this humanoid is very intelligent. I believe it was just playing a game with you. And it just wanted to see how far it could take you. I gotta tell you, doc... this sounds like a bad B-movie to me! Well like it or not, that creature is fairly harmless and we have to capture it again before it dies. It's the find of the century! Okay. What can we do to help? Well, follow me. I want to show you something in my lab. Okay. Okay, this is where the humanoid was, but it has escaped and we have to get it as soon as possible before it dies. Okay, um... I think the best idea is to go back to the lake, though. That's where we saw it last. Okay, that's fine but I'm going to need the video. The video? The video of the creature. I'm going to need it. For what? What do you need it for? Well, you see, I'm up for the Nobel Peace Prize this year. Why is it that we don't get a part of this? Well see, it's my discovery because I did see the creature first, so if anyone sees that you filmed it and give you the credit that means I'm out for the prize! I think we should give her the tape. She does deserve a Nobel Prize. Um...can we please excuse ourselves for just a minute? Okay, please, please... we don't have much time. No problem, no problem. C'mere, dummy. C'mere...dummy. Listen...do you have any idea how much money we are talking about here? Why? She deserves it, we don't. Did we not film it? Yes we filmed it, but... she discovered it...she... Did you see it by the lake? Yes I saw it by the lake, that's not going to help us. Then why... what? What is your problem now? I am telling you that-- It's back! [Grunting] [Fighting] Don't hurt it! Don't bruise the monster! My Nobel Prize is shot! Bitch! You're a bad, bad monster! Ken, let's just leave! Hit it! Don't hit it! Hit the fucker! Don't! It's the last survivor! Son of a bitch... Don't hurt him! Oh no! Come on, Ken! My Nobel Peace Prize shot...again! Oh...are you all right? I hope you're okay... I wish you could talk! You've gotta get them...get them, look what they did to you! Get them! [Monster growls] Go! C'mon, c'mon! This way! Just run! Woah, woah! Shit! Now what? I don't know... Run!! Go! Let's go in the house! The house?! Yes the house!! Come on, come on...up here! [Monster growls] Let's get them! Finish them off! Ken... Look at this... Hon...I'm a little tied up right now! it shows here that Doctor Ray was actually a Queen of Atlantis... she brought him with her just to take over our world or something! Not if I can help it. Look, here's a map. She has everything drawn out where she used to live. And all these other people that she killed who were against her. So you found the book, huh, and now you know all the deep dark secrets of the city of Atlantis. Everything would have been great and I could have gotten the Nobel Prize until you kids interfered. Now we'll have to wait until the sequel! Oh, great...now we've gotta sit through the sequel? Listen to me, green guy. I'm tellin' ya... this is wrong! She's evil...can't you see that? Come with us... we'll take care of you! No, no, I'm serious... come with us! She's evil... you know it! You know this is wrong! Don't believe him...he'll do anything to be a big director. I'm your Queen! I'm the reason why you're alive!! No! Hell with it...no more Mister Nice Guy, Fish-Boy! [Fighting] Wait! Stop, sorry... That is it, I'm sick of this! What is this? Y'know? I'm sorry. Oh... you're sorry. You're sorry! You're not the one that got hit! Okay, okay... let's cut. What's...what's the matter, Arvin? What's the matter? Look at me! Look at me! What? We're makin' a movie here, what are you doing? I look like The Creature From The Black Lagoon in drag! No, you look like an alien choir boy. Anybody can play your part! I'll just call SAG... Hey, man...I'm union! I'm union! Oh, buddy...you're gonna have hell, mister!! It's okay, pal. No, no... I turned down a part in "Chickboxer 2" for this! No, I know...but.... Makeup! Makeup! It's gonna be a classic! We can do great things with this! Cigarette! Now!! I'm sorry...I'm sorry... Can you believe this? Can you believe this? This is bloody ridiculous!! This is such a low-budget film...they forgot the blood! I came all the way from Deutchland for this? That's enough, go, go! [mumbles something incoherent in German] Bloody directors. Ken? Down here! What are you doing, hon? The screening's in twenty minutes! Aw, I just wanted to finish this up. I want it to be perfect! Now what are you doing? Well it needs a title, doesn't it? This I've got to see. Now I've seen it all! What? It needed a title, right? Since I'm the director, that's the title I gave it! Okay, director... let's get our butts to the screening before they think you've bailed out on them! [End title music plays]
