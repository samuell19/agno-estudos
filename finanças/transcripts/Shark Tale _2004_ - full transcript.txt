Man, you tripping! Five G's. See if this refreshes your memory. (GASPS) Wha... That's crazy. Look at that! You wrote everything down so you wouldn't forget. Wow. This is a perfect example of why you're in management and I'm not. You go, boy. I have to start paying Don Lino protection. Everything you owe me, you owe him. - How you figure that? - Simple. The food chain. You see, on top, there's Don Lino. OSCAR: Right. - There's me, and there's regular fish. - Mmm-hmm. - Oh, that's me. - No. There's plankton, there's single-cell amoebas. (STAMMERS) Then there's me. I'm getting there. There's coral. There's rocks, there's whale poo, and then there's you. That's messed up. So, if Don Lino's squeezing me, - he's squeezing you! - What? - (GRUNTING) - OSCAR: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. BERNIE: Easy, boss. - Find your happy place. - Happy place. There is no happy place with him around. - (IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) I'm serious! - (GASPS) Okay! Okay! Please, just give me some time. That's all I'm asking. (STAMMERS) I'm begging you, Sykes. Please! Please! All right. (EXHALES) (IN NORMAL VOICE) 'Cause I like you, I'm gonna give you 24 hours to pay up. All of it? How am I supposed to do that? That's your problem. Bring my 5,000 clams to the racetrack tomorrow, or else. Or else what? The boys'll explain. (BOTH LAUGHING) (ELECTRICITY BUZZING) OSCAR: Unpleasant. ANGIE: Five thousand clams? You borrowed 5,000 clams from Mr. Sykes? Oscar, why do you get yourself into these situations? (SIGHS) I don't know, Ang. (STAMMERS) It's just hard. All right? Because, um... I'm a little fish in a big pond. A really big pond. The ocean. I'm a nobody. I want some of that. - Mrs. Sanchez? - What? (DISCO PLAYING OVER STEREO) Ew! No. That. The top of the reef. Where the somebodies live. I wanna be rich and famous like them, but... I'm stuck down here. Well... What's wrong with down here? I'll tell you what's wrong with down here. Remember my dad? He worked at the Wash his whole life. OSCAR: He was the number one tongue-scrubber. Every year for 25 years. To me, working at the wash was the coolestjob in the ocean. But then I learned something I will never forget. (LAUGHS) Oscar's dad's a tongue-scrubber! ALL: Tongue-scrubber! Tongue-scrubber! Tongue-scrubber! Tongue-scrubber! Tongue-scrubber! Tongue-scrubber! My dad was the greatest. But nobody loves a nobody. (STAMMERS) I wanna be a somebody. Oscar, you don't have to live at the top of the reef to be a somebody. What's the difference? If I don't pay Mr. Sykes back by tomorrow, I'm dead anyways. Wait here. Wha... What's this? A pink pearl? - Mmm-hmm. - Where'd you get that? My grandmother gave it to me. She said it started from a tiny grain of sand. But then, after a while, it grew into something beautiful. Dreams can begin small, too. No. Uh-uh. - No, I couldn't... - Take it. It'll get you the money you need for Mr. Sykes. (BAND PLAYING CHEERFUL MUSIC) DON LINO: What do you mean, you don't understand? What's there to understand? We've been over this a thousand times. I don't want to say it again. You know, you're really giving me agita. I don't know how else to say this. You see something, you kill it, you eat it. Period. Thanks. That's what sharks do. That's a fine tradition. What's the matter with you? Your brother Frankie here, - he's a killer. - Thanks, Pop. He's beautiful. He does what he's supposed to do. Wipe your face. But you... I'm hearing things. You... You gotta understand, when you look weak, it makes me look weak. - I know. - I... I can't have that. Pop, I'm sorry. Lenny, Lenny, look at me. Look at me. This handing over the business is for you. For both of yous. (STUTTERS) You're acting like you don't even want it. I need to know that you can handle that. (SIGHS) (SHRIMP COUGHING) DON LINO: All right, all right. Right here, in front of me now, eat this. (WHIMPERING) Yeah. Oh, uh, gee. Thanks, Pop. Here's the thing. I'm on a diet. I read an article about shrimps. They're not good for you. You know how many calories are in one of those shrimps? A lot. It's true, it's true, and the other thing is, my sister had a baby, and I took it over because she passed away, and then her baby lost its legs and its arms, and now he's nothing but a stump, but I still take care of him with my wife, and it's growing, and it's... It's fairly happy, but it's difficult 'cause I've been working a second shift at the factory to put food on the table, but all the love that I see in that little guy's face makes it worth it in the end. True story. (SOBBING SOFTLY) (SIGHS) I'm not asking you anymore. I'm telling ya. Eat it. - No. Have mercy. - Pop, please. - Eat. - No eat! - What... No! - Son, eat the shrimp! LENNY: Please! ALL: No! Please! - Eat. Eat. Eat! - No! Eat! Eat! Eat! ALL: No! Put the shrimp down! All right. Go now. No one's looking. Get outta here. You're free. Go on. Go! Thank you. You're a good person. Come on, fellas. Pop, Pop, I can handle the reef. - It's not a problem. - No. No. We're gonna do this as a family. Frankie, take Lenny out, show him the ropes. Oh, come on, Pop. Son, you're gonna learn how to be a shark, whether you like it or not. (BELL RINGING) (CHEERING) That kid better show up, or he's dead meat. Just say the word, boss. Carrying a big old envelope full of money. Gonna give it to Mr. Sykes. Hurry up! This is our chance. You don't wanna miss it. Are you sure about this? A trainer friend tipped me off. The race is rigged. We can't lose. - What's the horse's name? - Lucky Day. MALE ANNOUNCER: The long shot, Lucky Day, at 200 to 1. FISH: We're gonna be rich. Rich! Ooh. Top of the reef, here I come! No! Wait. What am I doing? Remember what Angie said. Remember what Angie said. What did Angie say? Dreams can begin small. You just have to bet it all. Bet it all! MALE ANNOUNCER: And Lucky Day wins! (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) Yeah It's Oscar Five thousand on Lucky Day to win! (EXHALES) That's 200 to 1. That would pay a million clams! Well, I guess that makes me Oscar the Millionaire.

I was starting to think you skipped out on me. Sykes! Hey! Oh, I see you, uh, are already on your way to the concession stand. - What are you doing? - Bring us some drinks. - Why are you touching me? - That would be great. Thanks. Oh, and, uh, bring back, uh, some little wiener thingies. You mean the one with the toothpicks? What are you doing? Don't listen to him. Lola, let me escort you to my box. - Your box? - His box? You can't afford the gum under the seats. - Sykes. - He just laid five grand on Lucky Day. I think he can afford anything he wants. (EXCLAIMS) Five grand? My five grand? Uh-uh. No. It was another five grand. You had the money to pay me, and you bet it? - Hold up. Sykes! - Give me that! Clearly, I've made a mistake. No. No. Wait. Lola! Look. Deep down, I'm really superficial. And don't get me wrong, you're cute, but you're a nobody. ERNIE: Oscar, you cute, but you're a nobody. BERNIE: Wait! Lola! Come back! I'm not a nobody. I'm a wiener! - (LAUGHING) - (LAUGHING) You are unbelievable. You're in trouble up to your gills, and still you're asking for more? Huh? - Go on.

It's Fish Fingers followed by Sea Biscuit and Salmonella. The long shot, Lucky Day, is having trouble getting out of the gate. - What? - Only a sucker could've bet on that horse. Don't sweat it, man. He does this all the time. MALE ANNOUNCER: What's this? Lucky Day's crashing his way through, - and he's off and running. - (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Down the straightaway, it's Sea Biscuit, Fish Fingers and Lucky Day. Please, Lucky Day, go fast. MALE ANNOUNCER: Coming round the far turn, it's Sea Biscuit by a length, and Lucky Day well behind the pack. And here comes Lucky Day coming up from behind! He's passing Yellowtail, Salmonella, - coming up on Fish Fingers! - Who's your fish? MALE ANNOUNCER: Around the final turn, here comes Lucky Day. Lucky Day's caught up to Fish Fingers! They're head-to-head. Lucky Day's pulling ahead! OSCAR: Come on through for me, baby! I'm getting tired just thinking about counting all this money. MALE ANNOUNCER: Look at Lucky Day go! (BOTH SINGING) We're moving on up To the east side MALE ANNOUNCER: Absolutely amazing! This looks to be Lucky Day's big day. It's Lucky Day! Oh! What happened? Lucky Day is down.

I just wanna hold you. Oscar, get outta my way. - MALE ANNOUNCER: What a sad day for Lucky Day. - Remember your happy place. And that's why they call him the long shot. Yo, that was crazy! Right? Who knew? Everything's set, it's a lock, we good to go, we in the money, and he trips underwater. Who in the halibut trips under water? And by the way, on what? That's it! That's it! I've had it.

I didn't mean it, man. - Ernie! - (SCREAMING) - Oh, Ernie! - (LAUGHING) Ernie! You made a joke! Good one, mon. Respect. Respect. Bloodfire. (WHIMPERS) LENNY: Frankie, you know I can't do this. FRANKIE: Lenny, if you wanna make Pop happy, you gotta kill something. LENNY: Or I could find a very old sick fish and just wait. FRANKIE: Ugh. It's getting around, your thing at the restaurant.

Shh! SHORTIE 1: Yo! Put your fins on the wall where I can see 'em! OSCAR: Shh! Gotcha! Hey! Yo, the shorties! - ALL: Oscar! - What y'all doing here? - Check out my mad burner. - Check it out.

And besides, it's not safe to be out here at night. It is now, bro-bro! You the Sharkslayer! - Yeah, bro. - Yeah. - Sharkslayer? - What was that? (COUGHING LOUDLY) Sometimes I'll be coughing for nothing. Look, I just need you off of these streets. - Oh, come on, Oscar. - Get your butts home. I know your moms.

I don't want you mad at me, and I certainly don't want you to slay me. (LAUGHING) You having a good time, huh? You're enjoying yourself? Well, for your information, I am the Sharkslayer! Oscar the Sharkslayer. That's what people be saying. Wait. You mean you... Yeah. When the anchor... (GASPS) Oh, you're a liar. Hey, I didn't lie, all right? All right, I lied. But it was a little lie! Come on! Who's it gonna hurt anyway? Go ahead. I'm not explaining myself to you. - You know what? You're on your own! - No problem. And if, God forbid, someone should, oh, I don't know, find out the truth about the Sharkslayer on my way back... - You wouldn't. - I would. Uh... (CLICKS TONGUE) (EXHALES) Come here! Of course you can come with me. (LAUGHING) But, you know, I mean, you're a shark, and I'm a sharkslayer. So we can't be seen together. You dig, dog? Dig! Dug. Dug dig. Dig dog. Yeah. Yo, diggy dog! Just... Come on! OSCAR: Okay, Lenny. Follow my every move, and don't make a sound. LENNY: You got it. (ECHOING) Ooh, an echo. Echo. Now, batting for the Southside Sharks, number 15... - (SLAPS) - Ow!

I love you, man. Whoa! Hold up! You're my new best friend. Stop it. Okay, you wanna be friends? Fine. But we gotta lay down some rules. Rule number one, no "snuggly, buggly," whatever that just was. You got it. Anything else? Rule number two, and this is the most important rule. In the event that possibly you get hungry... Don't worry. I'm not gonna eat anyone. In case you haven't noticed, I'm different from the other sharks. Let's put it that way, leave it at that. Good night. - Define "different." - You'll laugh. I'm not gonna laugh. That's what you say, and then what happens later? You laugh. Lenny, I give you my word. Okay. I will tell you. I'm... I'm a vegetarian. (CLEARS THROAT) Hold up. (EXHALES) So, that's it? (SNEEZES) What do you mean, "That's it?" You're the first fish I ever told. I'm so tired of keeping it all a secret. - And my dad... - Whoa! Hey! He'll never accept me. What's wrong with me? Nothing is wrong with you, man. I think all sharks should be like you. That's sweet of you to say. And stop blaming yourself for what happened. Really? If you wanna blame anybody, blame me. If I hadn't been out there in the first place, none of this would have happened. Yeah. Gee, if Pop knew that, he'd ice you for sure. (CHUCKLING) "Ice"? What is he, the Godfather or something? - Yeah. - What you mean, "Yeah"? Yeah, he is. (GULPS) Hey, are you all right? (SCREAMS) - (SINISTER LAUGH) - (VIDEO GAME BEEPING) - I told ya! - I'm doing it! X, circle, X, X, double left, square, right trigger, down, square, square. Oh! Double square. - Respect. - Respect. Oh, yeah? Well, I've got news for you. The Sharkslayer made me his manager, so I'm now what I like to call "untouchable." (CHUCKLES) You hear me? - OSCAR: Sykes. - Hey, Oscar. Ow! Hey! Sykes. There he is, my brother, my player, the Sharkslayer. - Sykes, listen... - And another thing, from now on, you're gonna have to start paying me protection. The deal is off. That shark I killed was Don Lino's son. I know. Ain't it great? Not if he finds out. What do you mean, "Find out"? I've got him on phone right now. That's right, Lino, I got the Sharkslayer right here in front of me. Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm. And he's gonna slay you and all your sharks. Sykes, shut up! Shut up! Hey, that's good. I like that. Shut up, Lino. Ha! Shut up! - (GROANS) - What? Oh. Kid, he wants to talk to you. - I'm not here. - He's right here. Hello! "Shut up"? "Shut up"? You don't tell me, "shut up." - I tell you, "shut up." - (PHONE DIALING) - Hello? - How you doing? Let me have a pie with everything on it. Anchovies, meatballs, mushrooms. - Luca. - Oh. Hi, Boss, what are you doing working in a pizza joint? - Get off the phone! - But I'm hungry. (SIGHS) My guys are coming for you, Sharkslayer. They're gonna tear you fin from fin. Now who's your puff daddy? Huh? Who takes care of you? Huh? Huh? Come on, you two, we got work to do. (BOTH GROAN) I was winning. Sykes, you got it all wrong. SYKES: They're gonna write songs about you, kid. (SINGING) Oh, the shark bites With his teeth, dear Sing it, mon. And then Oscar Kicked his butt Sykes! Sykes, man! Come on! LOLA: Maybe I can help. Ooh! Hey, Lola! What are you doing here? You just be popping up sometimes, places. Well, you said to wait, so... (SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) I've been waiting. OSCAR: Uh... (CHUCKLES) Look, uh, I don't have a lot of time for the whole hand-clappy, making-the-lights-go-off, music-playing-in-the-dark thing, you know? What are you afraid of? Afraid? (LAUGHS) Yeah, that's funny. I ain't afraid of nothing. It's just... Ooh! Oh, baby, you are so tense. Yeah, I've been stressed lately. You know, protecting the reef. I do that by myself, you know. It's just... Just crazy. It's just too much. It's piling up. Yeah. Just one thing on top of the other. Actually, I was thinking about retiring. - You don't wanna do that. - I don't? You have worked your way to the top. You don't wanna go back to the bottom, do you? No. No. No way. You just show 'em who's boss, and those sharks will leave you alone. Yeah. You're right. Lenny. Psst. (WHISPERS) Lenny, where are you? - Hello, Oscar. - (GASPS) Angie! Hey. What are you doing here? What, Oscar, did you forget something? Um... Uh... You know... Oh, maybe you forgot your shark! (SLURPING) - Hi. - Uh... Shark! Swim, Angie. I'll cover you. Quick, before it's too late. - Go on without me. - Oh, stop it. Your pet shark told me everything. Dang, Lenny. Why would you do that? I don't know. I like her. Thank you. I like you, too. What were you thinking bringing him in here? I'm still working out the kinks. "Kinks?" You lied. Everybody thinks you "slayed" the shark. Who am I to tell them that they're wrong? How could you lie to me, Oscar? Me! Don't take it personally. I lied to everybody. All right, I'm sorry. I totally betrayed you. I got just one little problem I got to take care of. Oh, what's that? Sharks are coming to get me! And they should! What did you expect? You take credit for killing a shark, and then everything will be fine and dandy for the rest of your life? Uh... Yeah. But don't you worry. Me and Lenny got it. We gonna fix it. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's with the "We?" I don't want any part of this. Too late now, veggie boy. They'll be looking for you, too. Point taken. What's the plan? This is what we do. ANGIE: Oscar, here's the plan. You tell the truth, and you go home. (BOTH LAUGHING) This is what we gonna do, right? (GRUNTS) We gonna paint you up all bloody. A mess, right? Then you'll swim out and meet the sharks before they get here. Then you gonna say, "Stop! Don't go no farther. "That Sharkslayer's crazy, man. "He beat me senseless. "He's a stone-cold killer, man." You could tell 'em I'm huge. Tell them I'm handsome. You could throw that in. You're going way too far. Actually, he hasn't gone far enough. Exactly. What? You need to slay a shark, and I need to disappear. Here's what we're gonna do. This is Katie Current reporting live. We've had unconfirmed reports of... (ALL SCREAMING) (HUMMING JAWS THEME) Da-da-da! Look! It's the Sharkslayer! (GRUNTING) (LAUGHS) (ROARING) Da-da-da-da (GROANS) Holy mackerel! Did we get that? Hey, Ang. Oscar's on the TV. OSCAR: Show me that. Go ahead with your bad self. Ugh. - (CROWD CHEERING) - Do you hear them, Lenny? They are going crazy. They love us. - They love you. They hate me. - What? Can we switch sides? Maybe I can be the Fishslayer. They'll never see it coming. Come on. You sell this, you'll never have to go home again. You can start a new life. Give me a growl. Okay. (GROWLING SOFTLY) (CLEARS THROAT) (THUNDEROUS GROWLING) (CROWD EXCLAIMING) Like that? That was... pretty good. Let's go. (GROWLING) Is that all you're offering? Do you understand how huge my client is? Turn on your TV right now. (GROWLING) Wait, Lenny. Hold up. Lenny! Lenny! Lenny! Lenny! (GASPS) Turn off your TV! Turn off your TV! OSCAR: Don't swallow. - Oscar? - No. It's Pinocchio. Of course it's me. Why did you do that? - I'm sorry. - No, no. Sorry is when you step on somebody's fin at the movie theater. Sorry is when you say, "When is the baby due?" and the person is just fat. This is as far away from sorry as you could possibly get. But, Oscar, I think I'm gonna puke. (GAGS) No, no, no. No, no, no. Lenny, just open up nice and easy. (OSCAR GRUNTING) (ALL GASPING) (STRAINED GRUNT) (CROWD CHEERING) Are you not entertained? Go, Oscar, man! You can't handle the truth! Go get 'em, Oscar! You had me at hello! Turn your TV back on. What are you doing turning your TV off? Turn it on! OSCAR: Yippee-ki-yay! Go, Oscar! OSCAR: Whoo-hoo! (GROANING) This reef is huge. How we supposed to find the Sharkslayer? (LENNY SCREAMING) (CROWD CHEERING) OSCAR: This is it, Lenny. Big finish. Just like we practiced. - The flying fish. - The flying fish? A little help here, buddy boy. Sorry. OSCAR: Thank you. Whoa. (SCREAMING) Curse you, Sharkslayer! (SCREAMING) (SCREAM FADING OUT) (MIMICS CRASHING SOUND) (SIGHS) Yeah. And you tell Don Lame-O that I don't never, ever, ever, ever, ever, never wanna see another shark on this reef again. - Ever! - Oh! Remember this name, Oscar the Sharkslayer! Aha! You see? You see? Huh? CROWD: (CHANTING) Oscar, bumaye! Oscar, bumaye! Oscar, bumaye! Oscar, bumaye! Ah! Oh, look at Oscar. Oscar, bumaye! Oscar, bumaye! Whoo! Hey, Lo... KATIE: Seems the Sharkslayer not only conquered a few sharks today, - but maybe a few hearts. - (GASPS) Has the reef's most eligible bachelor been snapped up? I'm Katie Current, here live watching the Sharkslayer making out. Hey, Angie, can you hand me the blue one? Thank you. Hey! Who stepped in the room? (OSCAR LAUGHS) Ho, ho, ho, yeah! Oscar and Lenny. What a team, baby. - Unh. Give me some fin. - High fin. Low fin. Yo, did you see me? I was like... (KARATE YELLS) Ha-ha! I was great! When you punched me, and the crowd was, "Ahh!" They ate it up. Angie, you ain't know I had it in me, did you? It was like an Oscar-splosion. - How good was I? - You was the bomb. Thank you. Thank you. And hey, hey, hey. Casanova. I saw your big finish on the news. Nice smooch, lover boy. Ixnay on the iskay, man. That's private. It's private. Private? The entire reef saw you do it. Hey, whoa, somebody's in a bad mood. Ang, let me see the smile. Show me the smile, baby. Knock it off. Uh... What has gotten into you? Me? Oh, I swear, sometimes I wanna take your big dumb dummy-head and just... (GRUNTS) Ang, what is the problem? There's no problem. I don't have any problem. Miss Perfect is the one with the problem. Um, hey, you guys. What do you got against Lola? Not my lips, that's for sure. Ooh. What's going on? Uh, I'm gonna stay out of this one. Why would you even care about Lola? - I don't. - You don't? - No. - "No," what? - I don't know. - Guys, you wanna... - No! - No! Just tell me, Oscar, 'cause I'm curious. Why do you think she's interested, huh? Do you think for one minute that she would even be with you if you weren't the rich and famous Sharkslayer? - Please don't fight. - Are you that blind? At least she treats me like I'm somebody. Would she love you if you were nobody? Nobody loved me when I was nobody! I did! Before the money... And before the fame. Before the lie. To me, you were a somebody, Oscar. Now you're nothing but a fake. A sham. A con. You're a joke. LENNY: Here I come. Ta-da! (SINGING) Sebastian The whale-washing dolphin (MIMICS DOLPHIN CLICKING) - Angie... - No. Forget it. Just go, 'cause I'm tired of hearing how everything you had in your life wasn't good enough. Including me. (SIGHS) LENNY: Angie. Oh, honey, I'm... I'm sorry. Go... Go back and do it again. Hey, come on. It'll be okay. One shot to your heart Without breaking your skin No one has the power To hurt you like your kin Kept it inside Didn't tell no one else... You can't handle the truth! You've got shark breath! And now you only have Yourself to blame If you continue To live this way Get it together You wanna heal your body Get it together You have to heal your heart... (ALL CHATTERING) MRS. SANCHEZ: What you kids doing? How many times I have to tell you? It's past your bedtime. Go on. Go on. (SHORTIES CHATTERING) Hey, what are you kids up to? That looks pretty good. You guys should do this for a living.

Oh. Hey, Oscar. Preparation O. (DISCO MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) Angie was right. I am a joke. (SCOFFS) Hey, Sharkslayer. Why are you out here? All your friends are inside. Not all my friends. You mean that little bottom-feeder from the Whale Wash? Forget about her. She's a nobody. No. I'm the nobody. (LAUGHING) Oh, let me guess. She told you that she loves you. Is that it? (LAUGHING) It's not like you feel the same way about her. (LAUGHING) I don't think this is gonna work out. Wait. Are you dumping me? (GASPS) Let me explain something to you. (SINGING) We're gonna party like it's your birthday (THUMPING) Ha! Young love. (ALL LAUGHING) (GROANS) Ooh Sugar pie, honey bunch You know that I love you I can't help myself I love you and nobody else... - Hey, Oscar! - I can't talk. I got to find Angie. I need to tell her I love her. You come and you go Way to go, Oscar! - (PHONE RINGING) - Irie. Whale Wash... Gimme the phone. Where you get a whale of a wash. Gimme back the phone. And the price is... Very, very low, considering how good the wash is. BERNIE: Good one, Ernie. How many times do I have to tell you? It's "gosh." "You get a whale of a wash and the price, oh, my gosh." - (PHONE RINGING) - Me get it, mon. Whale Wash. Rhymes with "gosh." (LAUGHING) Give me that. Get out of here. Go be useless someplace else. Sykes, where's Angie? - (PHONE RINGING) - You tell me. Whale Wash. You get a whale of a wash... Oh. Huh. - It's for you. - Huh? Hello. - LUCA: Is this the Sharkslayer? - Yeah. Who's this? It's Luca, the octo... I mean, forget about it. Now you follow these instructions to the letter like, okay? File cabinet, top drawer. There's a package. Get it. That's right, tough guy. We got your girl. There's going to be a sit-down in one hour. Who is it? Shh! Be there, if you don't wanna see her sleeping with the fishes. The dead ones. Now, nod your head if you understand. Now, tell me if you nodded your head. I nodded. They got Angie, and they want a sit-down. I never meant for anybody to get hurt, especially not Angie. This is all my fault. SYKES: Classic move. I've seen it a thousand times. They take the thing you love the most, and then they use it against you. We got to go to that sit-down and save her. Whoa, whoa. I wanna save Angie, too, but I can't waltz in there and say, "Hi, Pop. I'm a dolphin." - Lenny? - "And the Sharkslayer's a fake." - Fake? - We're gonna need a better plan. (LAUGHS) This is a joke, right? This is a joke. Because I told Lino... - SYKES: Shut up, Lino! Shut up! - (GROWLS) (IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Tell me you didn't make it all up. Tell me that's not Lenny. Tell me you're a real sharkslayer, please. I'm sorry, Sykes. I'm not. But the sharks don't know that. (GULPS) (GULPS) (BREATHING NERVOUSLY) (BOTH GASPING) (GROWLS) (ALL GASPING) Stop screwing around. This will never work. We're dead. We're dead. Shh. Thank you, Sykes. Thank you. And my man Sykes has just begged me not to murderlize all y'all up in here. Now, I might listen to him, but then again, I might not. And that depends on the individual behavior of all the individuals in here, individually. - Ain't that right? - (GRUNTING) Look. He's got dolphin muscle. My Uncle Vito got whacked by one of those. Which one of you sardines called this meeting? That would be me. So, this is the Sharkslayer. I've been looking forward to meeting you. I feel like we're practically family. You know that? Funny, ain't it? I brought my kids into the world full of love and care, and you took 'em out. You know who I am? Do you know who I am? I'm the Don, the boss of the great white sharks. Boss, I saved you a seat. (SCOFFS) I've been running this reef since before you was born. If you thought a guy like me can't get to a guy like you... Guess what? You thought wrong. (MUFFLED SPEAKING) (MUFFLED GRUNT) (SCOFFS) Man, you the one who's wrong. I barely know that girl. What's your name, miss? (MUFFLED GRUNT) LOLA: Oh, yeah? Well, I say he's bluffing. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Marone, if I wasn't married. How ya doing, pretty lady? Ugh. Lola. We meet again. You know, Sharkslayer, there's only one thing I like better than money, revenge. Oh, I'm in love. Your shark slaying days are over, and there ain't nothing you can do about it. (OSCAR LAUGHING) (LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY) (ALL LAUGHING) (LAUGHING) - Huh? What's so funny? - Ow! You got nothing. Nothing! Sebastian, take her out.

You don't grow one back without my okay. Okay? - Okay? - Okay. - (SNEEZES) - If you sneeze, you don't wipe that boogie without my okay. Okay? - Okay. - All right. And you don't say "okay" without my okay. Okay? (MOANS) Uh-oh. Okay. Thank you all for coming. Good meeting. We got to go. Oh, and one more thing. What is with all y'all living in the Love Boat? Oscar. Y'all supposed to be the Mob. Get yourselves a real hideout. (GAGGING) Oscar. And take a good look, Lino. It's over. You're old school. - Oscar! - What? MALE SHARK: Oh! The horror! The horror!

I thought I lost you. What are you wearing? Huh? What is that? Whoa! Ho-ho ho! Hey, Boss, it's Lenny. He was wearing a disguise so we wouldn't recognize him. But now he's not wearing a disguise, so we do recognize him. Hi, Pop. Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? Are you out of your mind? Do you have any idea how this looks? This is the best sit-down I've ever been to. What are you doing with this guy? He took out your flesh and blood, Frankie. But, Pop, just listen... But nothing. You never take sides against the family. Ever! Hey, Don, Lino, sir. It's not his fault. This is between you and me. What did I ever do to you? You took Frankie away, and you turned Lenny into a dolphin! - I'm gonna get you. - (SCREAMS) ANGIE: Oscar, look out! Oscar, swim for your life! (GROWLING) You're gonna regret the day you became the Sharkslayer. Well, well, well. Look who's stuck in the porthole. - Huh? - You still hungry, big guy? Well, say hello to my little friends. (HUMMING CHARGE) (SCREAMING) (LAUGHING) - Try it again. - (PHONE RINGING) Whale Wash, you get a whale of a wash and the price... Oh, my gosh! All right! You got it right. You got it right. Move! Everybody, out of the way! Blow out! (WHALES SQUEALING) Come on, Lino. It's time to clean up your act. (DON LINO GROANS) Pop, leave him alone! (YELLS) All right, Lino, game's over. Ah! Ooh! Lenny? What are you doing in there? - Sorry. - Where's Lino? He's right behind me, isn't he? You're mine now. (SCREAMS) Whoa! Let's finish this, Sharkslayer. Oh, we're about to. (SHOUTING IN SLO-MO) (SCREAMS) (MACHINERY POWERING DOWN) (MUSIC PLAYING ON HEADPHONES) Thank you for coming to Whale Wash. (CROWD CHATTERING) Okay, somebody needs to get me out of the bubble, today. - Ooh. - (CROWD CHEERING) - Angie... - The Sharkslayer has done it again. This time luring two sharks into his deathtrap of hygiene. Oscar, you're the somebody everybody wants to be. - Angie! - The top of the food chain. Tell our cameras how it feels to be you. Oscar, get me out here. Quick. I need to get a head start so I can get as far away as possible. Look what you did to him. It's all a big misunderstanding. - Sharkslayer, over here. - If you'd just... ALL: (CHANTING) Sharkslayer! Sharkslayer! Sharkslayer! Sharkslayer! Sharkslayer! Stop! (SHOUTING) I am not a real sharkslayer! (CROWD QUIETS DOWN) I lied. What? And I'm not a real financial adviser. (SOBBING) Okay. It was an anchor that killed Frankie. I didn't have anything to do with it, and neither did Lenny. If that was true, why did you run away? Because you always wanted me to be like Frankie. I'll never be the shark you want me to be. What is your problem? So your son likes kelp. So his best friend's a fish. So he likes to dress like a dolphin. So what? Everybody loves him just the way he is. Why can't you? Don't make the same mistake that I did. I didn't know what I had until I lost it. Will you get me out of this? So I can hug my kid and tell him I'm sorry. Pop. Come here, you. I love you, son, no matter what you eat or how you dress. ANGIE: Oscar? Angie? Ah, Angie. I wish I knew now what I knew then. I mean, I wish you knew what I knew... Uh, I mean, before this. You're blowing it, man! Mind your business. It's emotional and it's pressure. What I'm saying, I just... I didn't need the top of the reef. Everything I wanted was right there in front of me the whole time. Well, what about being a somebody? I'm nobody without you. (KISSING) (CHUCKLES) You're not helping. (CHUCKLES) Oh, come here, you big dumb dummy-head. (CROWD CHEERING) I never told you two this, but you're the best henchmen a guy ever had. Come on. Group hug. - Ow! Hey! - Sorry, mon. Sorry. Come, Sykes, try again, mon. Go for it. Oh, forget it. The moment's gone. So, uh, Lino... Uh, Don... (CHUCKLES) We cool, right? Like, the reef is safe. You know, walk the streets without... Aah! You know. Yeah. We're cool. (ALL CHEERING) KATIE: Oscar, excuse me. Oscar. You've lost everything you lied so hard to achieve. Tell me, what's next for you? Come on. Everyone's waiting, Mr. Manager. Just got to put the finishing touch on my new desk. Love you, Pop. - Yo, dog! - Sykes! All right, partner, let's see what you can do.
