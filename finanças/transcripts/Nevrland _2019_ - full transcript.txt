Shout to me when you are awake... Good Morning. For how long are you observing me? Quite a while. No need for thanks. What for? That I saved you. Saved me. From what? From ending at some dirty porno-site. Normally we thank for that. By the way, what's your name? Jakob. And you? Kristjan. Do you live in Vienna? Yes. Anyway, for the time being. That's also the reason.. why I don't speak German very well. It's not so bad. Thank you, sir. Also, what is wrong with you? What would be wrong with me. Tell me something about yourself. What are you doing? Are you working or still at school? I just finished my final examination. Congratulations! So at autumn you attend univesity? Cool! What do you want to study? No, it's unusual.

It's still farther off, but... it's coming closer. Very good. You can open your eyes. Now, go get another chair... and find the spot in the room... where you feel your fear is. Is that the spot? Yes. Good. Now sit back down in the chair that represents you. And now ask your fear why it is coming so close. I feel stupid. It doesn't matter, feel stupid, but give it a try. Why are you coming so close? Very good. Now get up and go sit down in the fearchair. Jakob asks: "Why are you coming so close?" And what does your fear say? I can't do this. Just try. There's no wrong reaction. I can't do it. Why are you coming so close? No! Inhale deeply. And slowly exhale. Inhale... and exhale.

How are you doing? Better. Thanks. Cut. I always visit this place when I need time for thinking. Have you ever been here before? He died during the night, when I went to the Club. I'm sorry. It would not have made a difference. Do you believe in a soul? I don' t know. Depends on what you mean by that. A part that does not vanish when the body dies. I think I believe in a soul, but not in a religious sense. And what about when Art is the expression of the soul? The printing of your thoughts? Your inner life? Are you an artist? I study art at least. Do you like it? frankly speaking, I find it hard to understand Art. I think, it is not so much about understanding, but rather about experiencing. Take a look here. Is there anything here what attracks your eye? Interessting. Dionysos. The God of the ritual extacy. Yeah that is it, right? Yes. But I don't know why. Probably because the guy is naked. Idiot!

Take off your shirt. Come on. We have seen each other already naked. That's something different. In what way is it different? I don't know. It's so real now. It was also real before, isn't it? I did not mean it that way. Come over. Put yourself in my place. Make a foto now. Jakob....No! Jakob, no...! Stop! On a scale of one to ten... how strong is your fear? Jakob? Jakob! Everything ok? Ten. And now ask your fear why it is coming so close. Why are you coming so close? Jakob asks: "Why are you coming so close?" To protect you. What's the time? What was that, Jakob? Only a panic attack. A panic attack only? You have scared the shit out of me, Jakob. I am sorry. Best I go. And how does it feel? As... as a black hole... within my breast. I don't want you to expel. But it is... My last intimate relation... dates from a long time ago. Why did you want to meet me? Do you want the truth? Because of your fire marks. Have you inherited? Yes. They told me, from my mother. You don't know her? She was gone, when I was about six years or so. That's misery. Can I touch it? How does it feel? It is more sensitive. Did you hear that? What? Fuck.

More sensitive. Kristjan? Did you hear that? What's going on? Fuck. There is someone in the house. Jakob, no! Stop! My last intimate relationship... Did you make that?
