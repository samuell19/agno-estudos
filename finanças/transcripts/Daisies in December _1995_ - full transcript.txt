Well, it looks very nice. Don't you think it looks lovely, Gerald? Look Dad, if you really object to this we can turn right round. You can come with us, granddad. We've already had this discussion, Matthew. We can always look around for something else. It's not the place, Joyce, it's the philosophy that offends. What philosophy? I'm not to be trusted on my own. I mean one little mistake. One nearly fatal mistake. And that brands me as a menace to society, does it? You're certainly behaving like a menace now. With a face like that, you'll terrify those nice old ladies. Bugger the nice old ladies. - That should brighten up their Christmas. - Shut up, Steven. Help me get your granddad's stuff out of the car. Bye, Gerald. Goodbye, Joyce. I'm sure you'll have a marvellous time. Not if he's got anything to do with it. Well, I think this is very nice. Say goodbye to your granddad and wait downstairs, boys. At least there's a decent bed. Mm. You ought to be coming with us. And what would I do on skis? - Fall over a lot. - Precisely. You mind you don't break anything. Oh, we've got mum and dad well insured. A big enough bathroom, isn't it? Even got a shower cap, at least... I think it's a shower cap. Soap. Nice big towels. Oh... well, that is handy. A little sewing kit and... something to polish your shoes with. Look. Oh, wonderful. I can't wait to sit in the bath, sewing my socks, shining my shoes and wearing my shower cap. Dad, we really want you to enjoy this. We couldn't leave you alone, not after what happened. It was an isolated incident. Yes, well... no point in going over old ground. Absolutely. Well, 'll see you in 2 weeks then. Don't be surprised if I'm still sitting here. And you'd be a damn fool. Places like this are bloody nice. Places like this are the equivalent of a kennel. When you go on holiday, pets go into kennels, elderly relatives go into places like this. You could have a very pleasant 2 weeks here, if you weren't so determined to be miserable. I do not enjoy being surrounded by old people. Mr. Carmody, I'm Miss Glaistow, resident physiotherapist and general dogsbody. And I always make it a point of greeting our guests and explaining the room. Oh, really? Have your guests had little experience of rooms? What is their natural habitat? The Serengeti? The Arctic tundra? My father's a little unhappy at being dumped. At least that's how he sees it. That's exactly how it is, Arthur. I don't mind accepting that fact, but I do object to your dressing it up as a little treat for the old man. So... is he going to settle in? Just drive. Almost finished. Likes and dislikes. I like privacy and I dislike personal questions. Very well. I'll leave you to get your bearings. Thank you. Mr. Carmody, this is not a prison. And though you may not believe it, we actually have guests who keep coming back... year after year. Tea is served in the main lounge at 4 o'clock. Can I help? - Which way is the town? - You mean the shopping centre. The shopping centre in the town. Well, there is a shopping centre in town, but it's not as near as the one off Downing road. - Are you driving? - Walking. Well, in that case you're best go to the one off Downing road. Let's-let's-let's start again, shall we? I mean... the front, the seafront, is that anywhere near Downing road? Oh, no, no. That's at the bottom of the town. But it's nowhere near the shopping centre. - How far? - What? The seafront. A mile and a half. It's not so bad going down because it's downhill, but coming up is uphill, so you best get a taxi. Oh yes, I will. They said it was going to rain this afternoon. Oh, dear me, and I left my shower cap in the bathroom. Yep, where to? - I'm looking for an hotel. - Yeah, what sort of price? I-I don't need an hotel, I have an hotel. I just seem to have mislaid it. What's the name of it? What's it called? I don't know. Oh, you mean you've forgotten? I doubt I ever knew it. I wasn't paying particular attention when I arrived. And you don't know where you're staying? No. Ah, this is a first, this is. Can you give me a clue? It's a large imposing building, overlooking the sea. Well, there's about 15 like that in this place. It-it has a large garden. Hm, well, they've all got large gardens. Look, just-just drive around will you, I'll know it when I see it. Did you bring your room key? No. Well, have you got a receipt? No, nothing. Nothing. You got no receipt nothing or no money nothing? I left my wallet in the safety my room. How much money have you got? Got some loose change. Hmph. Find the hotel, will you? You'll be paid in full. Don't look at me like that, I'm completely trustworthy. Well of course, the place looks quite different at night. Yeah, don't we all. - You stay here. - Ah, no, I don't think so. After all you forgot the name of the hotel, didn't you? I told you I forgot to make a note of the name of the place when I went for a walk. Oh, same difference. Who's to say that you won't forget that you owe me 12 pounds on the clock. - Don't be impertinent. My key please. - Yes of course, Mr. Carmody. - Can you remember your room number? - Yeah, you'll be lucky. Oh, here it is. Number 316. 316. You got that? Young lady, I'm going to my room and I shall be returning almost immediately. If this man makes any attempt to follow me I'll be very grateful if you will take steps to have him removed from the hotel. Is that understood? Hey! Hang on a minute. You know, I've really got to hand it to you, you've got some nerve. Yes, and limited patience. Look, I'm the one who's had patience, for driving you around all afternoon. because you didn't know where you were staying. Ugh! I'm so sorry. How stupid of me. Are you alright? Look, I-I was an absolute idiot, lunging out like that. You didn't happen to play rugby as a boy, did you? Rugby, sorry? Not important. I seemed to have dropped my book. Oh, well, allow me. Thank you. I want to give you my... my profuse apologies. No great harm done. Just took me by surprise, that's all. American football, perhaps? And perhaps not. I thought I'd save you the trouble of coming back down. And the woman at the desk said not to worry. Why, it happens all the time, guests forgetting where they're living. All these hotels look the same, but you know that. After all you saw enough of them this afternoon, didn't you? 20. I've got change in the taxi. Not necessary. Well, thank you very much. Look, if I was out of line back there, I apologise. Well, after all we're all going to grow old one day. Yes, one day we undoubtedly will. Mr. Carmody, reception told me about your afternoon. I hope it wasn't too upsetting. Well, I'll be off then. Thank you. Ooh, um... - What's that? - My card. In case you need a taxi. And my name's Derek. And, uh, what's the name of this hotel again? Look, just go away, will you. It's Tregenna Castle Hotel. 316. Thank You. I'm afraid you've missed your dinner. Perhaps you'd like some sandwiches. Oh, I don't think so. I'm... I'm feeling a little bit groggy. Oh. Well, in that case, I'll leave you to rest. What kind of sandwiches? Ham, roast beef, cheese. Could you do roast beef with horse raddish sauce? I think we could manage that. I'm not hungry you understand but, uh... - I might get peckish later on. - Of course. Oh, and um... Miss... I'm sorry, I've forgotten your name. - Miss Glaistow. - Miss Glaistow, uh... I'd be very grateful if nothing was said about my little jaunt this afternoon. Oh, you don't have to worry, our staff are very discreet. Well, given the age of your guests, there's not much to be discreet about. I think you'd be surprised. What does that mean? As I said Mr. Carmody, we're very discreet. The key, the key... What number? What's my number? Margaret. Margaret! [SOBBING] [SOBBING CONTINUES] This way, Mr. Carmody. This is table 4. And I think you'll find it very pleasant. This is Miss Dean. How do you do? Mrs. Carmichael. Good morning. Mr. Prager. Welcome. The vacant chair belongs to Mrs. Palmer, who I'm sure will be joining us shortly. Table 4, this is Mr. Carmody. Morning. Oh, before I go, I would just like to mention my lecture programme again. If any of you would like to give a little talk, about your life or your work, there are a few evening slots available next week. I've one already, to talk about patchwork quilts. That's Tuesday, isn't it? Yes, Tuesday. It's really male speakers we're short of. What about you, Mr. Prager? You couldn't print my experiences, let alone speak about them. I really meant work experience. Those you wouldn't be interested in. I'm sure you're just being modest. For 40 years I was the biggest manufacturer of elastic in the East End. Oh... fascinating. What elastic keeps up, may be fascinating. But the stuff itself is dull. It stretches, it shrinks... what more is there to say? And what about you, Mr. Carmody? Oh, out of the question, I'm sorry. Well, do give it some thought, won't you? Enjoy your breakfast. - Excuse me, may I. - Oh, sorry. Will you be with us for Christmas, Mr. Carmody? I sincerely hope not. Oh, but it's very nice here. - Especially at Christmas. - Yes, I'm sure. Don't have the bacon. I beg your pardon? Better you should chew my elastic. Mr. Prager's from Yugoslavia. - And you are from? - Bristol. But before that? What part of Europe? ---- Christine's from Shrewsbury, and I'm from Milford Haven. Oh, indeed. I'm not Welsh, but my husband was in the Fleet Air Arm and we were stationed there. Fell in love with the district, so naturally, - when he retired we moved back. - Hm. And what did you do, Mr... oh, so sorry, what was your name again? Carmody. I knew a Lester Carmody when we lived outside Penrith. It's an unusual name. What would you like, sir? Solitude and peace. - Sorry? - Um... tea and toast will do nicely, thank you. I was saying, it's an unusual name. The time. No, your name. Quarter to nine. No, no. We were talking about your name, Mr. Carmody It must be, I wound it up before I came down. We were discussing your name. Sorry? Your name! Mrs. Carmichael was saying what an unusual name you have. I-I'm afraid it's clogged up again. What is? Well, I have this recurring ailment and... intermittent wax. What kind of wax? They tried syringing it but nothing gets through. Can you hear me now?! You won't think it rude if I read my newspaper, will you? Then you can forget all about me. Well, if you don't mind being left out of the conversation. It's the Daily Telegraph, I've taken it all my life. I always find the obituaries so comforting, don't you think? The first thing I read in bed in the morning. If I'm not in I get up. Poor fellow. Yes... Yes? I'm sorry sir, I left it as long as I could. Oh, you want to do the room. I won't be 5 minutes. Could you take off the rubber under the sheets? They make the bed smell like a gymnasium. Yes, sir. I have to lock up now, sir. Sir? What? Uh... Uh, yes, yes course. I'm in your way, aren't I? I'll only be a few minutes more. No hurry, no hurry. I think a walk. Yeah, it will do me good. Good morning. Are you all right? We bumped into each other last night. Oh, the rugby player. No, I'm fine, thank you. - It was really very clumsy of me. - Not at all. I-I think we're neighbours, you know? We are? Let me see... there we are... - 316. - 317. Yes well, that makes sense. Well, I won't disturb you any more. It's alright. Just one other thing... that music you were playing last night. When? Last night. Well, this morning, actually. Oh, I hope I didn't disturb you. Oh, no, no. No, no, not at all, not at all. I... I sometimes have trouble sleeping and... music helps. Yes, I know just what you mean. I... I always find sleeping difficult, first night in a strange bed. Hm. It was a violin I heard, about 2:00 in the morning. 2:00 in the morning! Oh, how selfish of me. No, no, no, it was... I mean the music was strangely comforting. The piece you heard was The Lark Ascending by Vaughan Williams. - I play it a lot. - Vaughan Williams. Do you know his music? No, but I saw him conduct once. Oh. Vaughan Williams. Oh, really! Big man, heh, he wore a crumpled suit. I mean the real conductor was in the full Dickey of course but... Vaughan Williams came out of the audience looking remarkably old. My god, that's odd. What is? It just occurred to me, that ancient, ancient man is probably younger than I am now. Well, I must get on with my walk and let you get back to your book. - The Lark what? - Ascending. Well... good morning. Good morning. Ah, Mr. Carmody. How is the wax situation? Sorry? The wax in your ear, has it settled down yet? The weather. No, no, not the weather, the wax. I went for a walk but luckily the rain held off. Good, good. Oh... here comes Mr. Prager and our fifth member. You won't have met Mrs. Palmer, she wasn't at breakfast this morning. This is Mr. Carmody, he has trouble with his hearing. Does he really? He has ear wax that comes and goes. Conversation is out of the question but he's really quite pleasant. Mr. Carmody, this is Mrs. Palmer. I've written it down. This... is Mrs. Palmer. And now our little party is complete. This must have happened very suddenly? It did. Mrs. Carmichael was talking to him at breakfast and it suddenly... went. Really? He seems to have trouble with his eyesight, as well. But perhaps someone should order for him. Oh, I'm sure he can manage. You don't want anyone to order for you, do you Mr. Carmody? - You can manage, can't you? - Um... Mrs. Palmer is asking if you wish someone to order for you! There is no need to shout. My condition is not too bad at the moment. Ah, so the wax has waned. I'm so sorry, it must be dreadful to be deaf... particularly when you're so... fond of music. Is he fond of music? Are you fond of music, Mr. Carmody? Muesli? No, no, I'm not particularly fond of muesli. Mrs. Palmer! Actually, I'm afraid... I'm so sorry, I'm... I'm... I've lost my appetite, will you excuse me. Really, Mrs. Palmer. A fellow human being's affliction is hardly a call for mirth. It's nervous laughter, please excuse me. Forgive me for saying so, Mrs... Palmer. but you really didn't make things very easy for me, you know? Easy for you? - Don't be ridiculous. - What? Well, I was the one that got told off for giggling. And what a pathetic excuse for ignoring everyone. But it was a spur-of-the-moment thing. I mean that Mrs. Whats-her-name would never stop talking. I'm afraid I'm not very good in the mornings. Neither am I. I really don't quite know what to do about it, this deafness thing, it's becoming a bit of an embarrassment. I should have a miraculous recovery if I were you. Otherwise we'll all have headaches from shouting at each other. Good book? A guide to the myths and legends of the area. My faithful companion. - You're down here alone, are you? - Yeah. The husband not with you? Oh, my husband's been dead for many years. So is mine. My wife I mean. Well, not my husband. Naturally enough. Was that your husband in the picture? What? The photograph in your room. You were in my room? I-I-I mean they were cleaning our rooms and I stepped outside for a minute and absent-mindedly stepped into yours. It... - it was only for a second or so. - Oh! No. Sorry? The picture was not of my husband. Interesting machine you have. The one with the tapes. Oh, my ghetto blaster. Ha. Well, that's--that's what my nephew calls it. Music means a lot to you. Yeah. I played and taught piano for years. Really? Yes, my wife played the piano. Very badly. Oh, I'm sure she didn't. Oh, she did, but with great gusto. We used to keep the piano in the box room and she'd go on in, she'd shut the door and she'd bang away. It was exactly the right sound level. It muffled all the wrong notes but the gist of the thing got through. - And you like a good tune, don't you? - Ah, yes. Give me something you can whistle. Do you do a lot of whistling? Well... not out loud. Mentally. And how did you make your millions, Mr. Carmody? I didn't make millions. No? You're very prosperous. - I didn't do badly. - At what? Stockbroking. Oh, so you were a stock broker. I would never have guessed. - Are you laughing at me again? - No... I wouldn't dream of it. Mr. Carmody, feeling better? Oh, much, much better, thank you. Oh, I'm so pleased. You can both be on my team. What? We're playing Give Us A Clue. But Mrs. Palmer is reading. Oh, not important. Well, it's been on the notice board all week. "Main Lounge, 4:30, Give Us A Clue." And I'm team captain. How are you now, Mr. Carmody?! - They're both going to be on our team. - Oh. I hear you're going to be on our team! He can hear you now, Miss Dean. I'm-I'm really quite hopeless at this sort of thing, you know. Now no false modesty, Mr. Carmody. You're going to be a great asset. All that miming you have to do when you're deaf. It's really very easy. You must have seen the television program. Uh, this is a book, this is a film, a play, a television show. And then we break it down into words and then into syllables. And this is words and this is syllables. I-I really can't do this. It's just charades under another name. I'm sorry, but I'm-I'm no good at making a fool of myself. Oh, I'm sure you'll manage beautifully. Very good. Well done. Now... I think we'll give this one to... Mr. Carmody. Um... I-I really can't do this. Oh, have a go. Or I'll tell table 4 what a fake you really are. Now don't hurry it, Mr. Carmody, we're only 3 points behind, there's still time to catch up. Ready? I-I really wish somebody else would do this. Two minutes for your team to get it and I'm starting the clock... now. Come on. Come on, Mr. Carmody, don't just stand there. Is it a play, a book, or a film? A film! Half a point off for talking. No talking, Mr. Carmody. If it's a film it's... this. Oh, it's a film! Ah, film. How many words? Four, four words. Now, first word. How many syllables? One. I'll penalise you again if you persist in talking. Can you mime it? Can you mime the first word? Does it sound like anything? Does it rhyme with anything? Well, it must sound like something. One minute gone. Well, don't just stand there, do something. The second word. The second word, second word. The next word. Any word. Fourth word. - You mean the fourth word. - Fourth word. Blowing. Glass blowing. - 30 seconds left. - Um, um, um... Hair dryer. Tree. Bend. ----- Blowing, blowing... 10 seconds left. Wind. Fourth word: wind. Gone With The Wind. Yes! Just scraped in under the bar. That's 5 points - minus half a point for talking, makes Mrs. Carmichael's team, one and a half points ahead. Well done, you two! Well guessed. I'd be very careful, Mr. Carmody, Why? Well, you might start to enjoy this kind of thing. ...and then, Mr. Carmody's mime finished the contest. Oh, I was just telling Mr. Prager about Give Us A Clue. ----- No sign yet of Mrs Palmer? Obviously not joining us this evening. - You spoke to her? - She would be here by now. - Is she alright? - I've not seen her. Has anyone checked? Checked? Yes. Phoned her room or anything. I mean she might be ill or something. - Are you ready to order, sir? - Yes. Uh, no, um... um... I left my glasses in my room, would you excuse me for a minute? - I can read the menu for you. - I wouldn't dream of troubling you. There's no trouble. It's a very short menu. Uh, Mrs-Mrs. Palmer? Oh... Are you all right? Yes, of course. I noticed that you weren't at dinner. No, I... I signed up for the outing tomorrow, so I thought I'd have an early night. Oh, yes, the outing tomorrow. Where are we going again? You signed up for it too? Well, anything to get out of this hotel. St. Michael's Mount. Oh yes, of course, St. Michael's Mount. Yes. Well... see you tomorrow then. Vaughn Williams? Poulenc. Plonk. Pou-lenc. Oh, yes of course, Poulenc. I've never heard of him. - Well, goodnight, Mr. Carmody. - Goodnight. Poulenc. Hm. Poulenc. Tomorrow's outing. Yes, Mr. Carmody? Is there room for one more? According to ancient legend, the mount is dedicated to the Archangel Michael who appeared before some fishermen in the year 495. Then became the hallowed place of countless Celtic saints. It is also connected with the romantic legend of Tristan and Isolde. The Hermit Ogrin was sent here by King Marke to buy for Queen Isolde, her wedding gift of finest silk. The present castle is built on the foundations of the Benedictine priors. Built... You sat on the bus with Mrs. Palmer. Yes. Very beautiful woman. Striking. - Don't you agree? - I really hadn't noticed. Oh, come now, Mr. Carmody. Don't pretend you haven't got her in your sights. What are you talking about? You and I have the European approach to women. - I'm not European, I'm British. - We are both hunters. It wouldn't do for us to stalk the same duck, get in each other's way and then go home empty-handed. How dare you! Say the word and I will not pursue her. Pursue her? You ridiculous little man! - Then you are interested. - Interested? I'm... I'm outraged. For why? For one thing, it's no concern of yours whether I'm interested or not. You have my word, Mr. Carmody, I will not trespass. There are other ducks in the pond. That I find equally offensive. Likening Mrs. Palmer to some kind of... waterfowl. You misunderstand. I am being poetic. Poetic? You haven't got a poetic bone in your body! What's the matter now? You've a face like thunder. - I doubt you want to hear. - I wouldn't have asked. That Richard Prager man had the temerity to suggest that he and I were competing for your affections. Are you? Certainly not. And if I've given any impression to the contrary, then I apologise. Hmph. Do you think Mr. Prager will make a play for me? He undoubtedly intends to. Huh. Cool. How can you accept such a thing? Oh, poor Mr. Carmody. You don't have much fun do you? Fun? Well, life is essentially ridiculous. Once you understand that, you can start to enjoy yourself. Come on. Have you got it all in? Most of it. - What do I press, this red thing? - Yes. Shall I take one with you in it? Only if you want to break the camera. - Mr. Carmody. - What? You made a joke. I make jokes all the time. - Really? - All the time. Well, you must point them out to me. They're obviously far too clever. Oh. This is the most romantic coastline. King Arthur, Merlin... and my particular favourites, Tristan and Isolde. I thought they were German. Oh, no, no, no. They were both true Celts. She was from Ireland, he was Cornish. Oh. Ooh, look. What? Daisies. Yes. But it's December, Mr. Carmody. Daisies in December? Well... Don't you find that strange? Well, I suppose so. It's so warm, they've forgotten what month it was. Mr. Carmody, you took your tie off. Hallelujah. Oh. No, don't hide it. It makes you look... distinct. Could we sit down for a bit? Have you been alone since your wife died? For a while. But then circumstances made me move in with my son and his family. No, that's not what I meant, uh... I mean, have you met someone else? At my age! What's wrong with your age? If you have to ask that, look at what a fool Mr. Prager makes of himself. Setting his sights on you as though you were a duck! I'm flattered. Don't be flattered by that ridiculous little squirt. He's probably wonderful in bed. I really think it's time we went back to join the others. All right. Ah! What's wrong? Nothing... I got up too quickly. It'll pass. Should I get help? Just give me a moment. Aah... Heh... yes. You see? All better. Take my arm. Thank you. ...in the lounge, Mrs. Palmer? The locals are giving a recital of Gilbert and Sullivan. Oh, I think not. The sea air has quite exhausted me. - Sounds like they're off already. - Save me a chair by the front. I'll go and powder my nose. Coffee in the lounge, Mr. Prager? I cannot imagine anything more pleasurable. I see the duck season's in full swing. You don't fancy Gilbert and Sullivan? Another time, perhaps. You know, I-I-I rather enjoyed our conversation this afternoon. So did I. Well, I was just wondering if-if... you'd care to continue it, so to speak, over dinner tomorrow evening. Oh, Mr. Carmody, are you asking me out? Well, it's difficult to get a word in edge ways when Mrs... What's-her-name starts talking. I'm-I'm not... setting my sights on you or anything. Just it'd be nice to have a quiet dinner for a change. You do realise that if neither of us turn up Table 4 will be a hotbed of gossip and supposition. Bugger Table 4. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - No, no, it's alright. Bugger Table 4. Hello? Oh... is that Eric's Cabs? Eric speaking. Who's this? I'm the chap who got lost. Oh, yeah. Well what's happened now? I'm looking for a restaurant. Don't tell me you've wandered off in the middle of lunch. It's for this evening. I want good food, a decent wine cellar and not too many stairs. Do you mind French? Not if the food's good. Le Mange Tout. Do you want me to make a reservation? You wouldn't be getting a commission would you? Oh, you've got such a suspicious mind. Alright, make the reservation and call for us at 7:00. What's the name of your hotel again? The Tregenna Castle. Oh, you're getting better then. Bye. Oh. Mr. Carmody, you've gone too far. Oh, I haven't, have I? Well, I feel quite dowdy in comparison. You look absolutely radiant. - Oh, should-should I go and change? - Oh, no, don't do that. Ah... I'll get my purse. We-we could always leave separately if you're worried about the gossip. When you dress up like this, you be anonymous. Lah-de-bloody-dah. Thank you. I don't wear this hat for everyone, you know. I'm sure everyone will be very grateful. This is the 1809, is it? I mean, I seem to remember it being a little dryer than this. That's fine, thank you. Ah. To the loveliest woman in the room. Thank You, Mr. Carmody. I do wish you'd call me Gerald. Alright. I'm Katherine. Yes, I know. I sneaked a look at the hotel register. Did you now? Heh. Was all that... genuine? Of course. Only my husband used to make a great production of snipping the cork, swilling it around, gargling. Oh, I-I didn't mean to imply that you were as phony as he was. Was he? Well, not in every department. I-I don't mean to pry. Oh, it's alright. Women found him very attractive. And he invariably found them irresistible. I see. I put up with the excuses and the lies for as long as I could. There were no children, but... a marriage is a marriage. Oh... this is so strange. What? Well, I've never told anybody about this before. And Mr. Carmody, you're the most unlikely confidant. I didn't know but I'm so sorry. Oh, you don't have to apologise. Let's dance. Dance? Oh no, I don't dance. Everybody dances. Katherine, I do not dance. I have never danced. Gerald, I'm standing here and if you don't join me shortly, I'll grab the first waiter that comes around, if only to save face. But I haven't danced in years... and then I was dreadful. I'll be the judge of that. Hand here. The other one here. Now, try not to fall over. I'm not as bad as that. Katherine... why do you enjoy making a fool of me so much? You're not a fool. Besides... who's watching? Well... if anyone were. They'd think: "the lucky man, "that a gorgeous woman like me "should shuffle around the floor with such a terrible dancer." Then why do you make me do it? Because it gives you an excuse to hold me. And suddenly, I want to be held very badly. You know, with a bit of practice, you could be a very good dancer. I don't think Fred Astaire need worry. It was a lovely evening, Gerald. Yes. Do you have any outings planned for tomorrow? I thought I'd do a little exploring, locally. I'd be only too happy to show you around. - You know the district? - Like the back of my hand. Been down to the sea front, the shopping centre... around all the hotels. Alright. You can give me a guided tour. After lunch? After lunch. Alright. Uh... sounds like your phone. Yes it does. Goodnight Fred. What? Oh, yes. Goodnight Ginger. Ahh. Yes. Grand dad, it's Stephen. Stephen, how are you? Great news. Mum and dad have been buried by an avalanche. Can I have this now. - We went to... - Shut up, bog rat. What's that? Oh, dad says you can make the arrangements. Look, Stephen, it's-it's... it's very good of you... but-but I... look, let me talk to your father. Hello, dad. Are you gonna join us? Arthur, look, I really I am very touched that you should want me but I can't possibly leave here at such short notice. What... are you alright? Have you met anyone interesting? Oh, no, no. They're all deadly dull, but... the-the place itself has distinct possibilities. I mean, they organise all sorts of outings, and there's a fairly decent shopping centre not too far away. But nothing very exciting. And I still have my reservations about being forced to mix with people I don't really know. And on the other hand, there's always a chance that you might meet a kindred spirit. Well, not-not that I have, you understand, but the possibility exists, and that's the important thing. Yes. And-and the town itself is really quite pretty. There's a decent enough seafront. All the usual attractions. Now believe me, Arthur, I really appreciate that you and the boys have gone to so much trouble. Whatever else I am, I am a stayer! I'll just grit my teeth and weather it out, no matter how grim it gets. Katherine. Yes. You don't know where the TV lounge is, do you? I haven't looked for it. Well, I just happened to notice that Brief Encounter is on this evening. - The film? - Yes. Oh... I haven't seen that in years. What time? 9:30. Be over by 11-ish. - I'll cry like a drain. - Oh, so will I, probably. It's been years since I had a night out at the pictures. Me too. As a matter of fact, I think the last time was probably the first time I saw Brief Encounter. Mr. Carmody... you've got a date. [INAUDIBLE CHATTER] Celia Johnson, Trevor Howard, that's out. It's rather far, I know, but we should be delighted. - Please, please. - What is it? Next Thursday, the same time. - No, I couldn't possibly. - Please. I ask you most humbly. You'll miss your train. You're not angry with me, are you? No, I'm not angry. I don't think I'm anything, really. I just feel tired. Forgive me? For everything... Whatever your dream was, it wasn't a very happy one, was it? Is there anything I can do to help? Katherine? You certainly enjoyed that. Did I nod off? Not that you'd notice. See you in the morning. Goodnight. Katherine? Katherine. I think you left something in my room... Oh, my dear girl. What time is it? I don't know. How are you? Hm... better. What was it? Oh, something I ate. No, no, no, you were in agony. It's gone now. Well, at least just to see the nurse. Is that your arm? Ow... used to be. Don't be daft, you should've moved it. After the first hour I don't think I could have even if I'd wanted. Better? Think I preferred it where it was. Katherine, when you got up from the bench that day, on St Michael's Mount, it was the same thing, wasn't it? It was a dizzy spell, I told you. Katherine, I'd-I'd rather you didn't. What Happened? Well, I was in a fire. It looks much worse than it is. Anyone else involved? No, no... only me. My house, my responsibility, my... my stupidity. I put a pan of water on to boil an egg, I looked out of the window, I hadn't touched the garden for months after... M-Margaret died. By then it was spring and the weeds were coming up through the lawn, so down I went and I... set to work. Of course, the water in the pan boiled dry and set fire to an oven glove or... dish cloth or something... The kitchen caught on fire. By the time they arrived the whole house was ablaze. I tried to... I tried to get-get... I tried to rescue things... but it was too late, I... I... everything went up in flames. And my... furniture, books... photograph albums... all the inessentials of my life. The things that meant nothing to me... until they were gone. Katherine... you-you don't have to... Well, your pulse is normal. Nothing out of the ordinary there, either. - Stomach cramps, you said? - Crippling. Probably something you ate. I'll give you something to settle it. What medications are you taking already? Oh, I uh, I thought perhaps a couple of um... Chloradexaphenerol might do the trick. That's a bit drastic, isn't it? Well, a friend recommended it. For stomach cramps? - Isn't it appropriate? - Where did your friend hear about it? I think he was prescribed it. Oh, well I don't want to alarm you but I think your friend has a something a bit more serious than stomach cramps. Oh, what's it for? It's chemotherapy. Cancer? I'm very sorry, I'm afraid so. Here, swallow these. You must be mistaken. I know what I'm talking about, Mr. Carmody. Get out. What? Just get out and leave me alone. Now look, Mr. Carmody, I realise this must be very upsetting... Get out! I'll make the nurse a full apology. Alright, I'll patch it up with her. - On one condition. - What? I still have no takers for the Friday talk slot. Oh, no, really. Oh look, lots of other guests have stocks and shares. I know they'd love to have the benefit of your... expertise. It's just for half an hour. All I have to do is answer a few questions? - Yes, that's all. - Very well. Oh, wonderful. 2:30, Main Lounge, Friday. In return I want to ask a favour of you. You're a man of business. Alright, what is it? When my son signed me in here, he must've filled in some sort of form concerning... - Do you want to see it? - No. I'm talking about Mrs. Palmer. I'm sorry, information about other guests is strictly confidential. You must understand that. Yes, of course, of course, I do understand but these are exceptional circumstances. In what way? She left these in my room last night. She said it was chemotherapy. Yes. It's part of a new treatment for cancer. They're calling it a breakthrough. What is the success rate? I really couldn't say. Why don't you ask Mrs. Palmer? Oh, no, no, I-I-I couldn't do that. She tried so hard to keep her illness from me. But it... it can be successful? I don't want to raise false hopes, Mr. Carmody. Will you see that these pills get back to her? Yes, no problem. I'll-I'll say one of the cleaning staff... Gerald, you're not wearing a suit. Or a tie. Oh. Your carriage is at the door, m'lady. What carriage? For the mystery trip. What mystery trip? Well, if I told you that, it wouldn't be a mystery, would it? Alright, what are we looking for? You haven't read your guide book very carefully. Somewhere, out there, in that bay, your hero, Tristan, fell in love with Isolde. Now, according to this, he was sent to Ireland by his cousin, King Marke, to bring Isolde back here, to be the King's bride. But... on the voyage back, they fell in love. I know. They drank a love potion by mistake. Oh. Well, don't you find that romantic? Well, I suppose so, but if it was a magic potion, then it was out of their hands. What about lesser mortals, like you and me? And how can we be sure that it's love? Might be something more explicable, like... senile dementia. Oh... sun's almost gone. - Well, it is December after all. - Mm. Don't let the daisies fool you. You know, I think, it wasn't some magic potion that made them fall in love... I think... it was the sea voyage. What are those? Listen, Katherine... I've managed to book the last 2 cabins on a Christmas cruise to the Bahamas. We fly to Florida on the 22nd and sail off on Christmas Eve. You've gone mad. It's the sanest thing I've done in years. Oh... I can't accept this. It's entirely selfish, I assure you. G-Gerald... No, no, listen Katherine, listen... I'm 73 years old, it's over half a century since I last fell in love. Even then I wasn't absolutely sure, because I've got nothing to compare it with. - Look... - No, no... - you don't understand... - please, let... let me finish. I don't know much about... ecstasy or great passion, or the stuff of legends. But if being in love means... not being able to get you out of my mind, wanting to be with you for every second of every day, then I haven't. There's no doubt about it, I'm sorry. You know nothing about me. I know enough. I've spent the most wonderful few days with you. I want it to go on. You have to give me time to think. Of course. It must have cost you a fortune. If it means spending time alone with you, it's cheap at any price. Can you get your money back if I can't go? Of course, I'm no fool. They told me that if I called them by 5 o'clock this afternoon, I'd get a full refund. Oh damn, it's 5 past. You're lucky. First you must understand, the decision isn't entirely up to me. I've been ill recently and... it wouldn't be fair to say anything without checking with my doctor. The Caribbean? Come on, he's bound to say yes. Oh, Gerald, it would be wonderful. Christmas in the Bahamas. Oh, dear... excuse me. Mr. Carmody, uh, Miss Glaistow passed on your apology. - Oh, that's alright. - No, that's not what I mean. She explained the whole situation and I'm the one who should apologise. It's-it's not necessary. I should've known as soon as you mentioned Chloradexaphenerol. Please, keep your voice down. Ooh, Lord, yes, that's her room opposite, isn't it? Such a lovely woman. And such a brave fight. Yes. Yes, thank you. You know. It doesn't make any difference. Difference? Of course it makes a difference. Gerald, I have cancer! But you're on medication and it's working, isn't it? At the moment. But it's like a pendulum. - Any day it can swing the other way. - But it may not. Look, we must take each day as it comes. It's-it's... it's just a cruise, Katherine! You and I know it's more than that. And you wouldn't have suggested it if you hadn't found out. I don't pity you, Katherine, I love you. Listen, Gerald, the treatment seems to be working, yes, but if it doesn't, my specialist has been wonderfully informative about the days I have coming to me. So, I wouldn't want to share them with anyone. Especially someone as loving, and as kind. Katherine. Katherine... - Mr. Carmody. - Yes. Are you fit? I looked for you at breakfast and lunch but you've been keeping to your room. We're expecting quite a turnout. You're not going to let me down, I hope. I'll be there. - Main Lounge, 10 minutes, alright? - 10 minutes. Oh... Mr. Carmody, this is my nephew, John. Hello. Mr. Carmody and I have been on a number of outings together. - What's happening? - John came to pick me up a day early. Why? I'm afraid my conference is an absolute washout. Frankly, I wasn't willing to waste the time. I thought you were here until the weekend. I'm not... I'm not upsetting anyone's plans, am I? No, of course not. Mr. Carmody understands. You can't. You can't. Gerald... please... Look, I don't mean to interfere but I think my aunt wants to be left alone to pack... why don't we go and have a drink? Why don't you mind your own business? Why don't I. I'll wait in the lobby, shall I? No! No need for that. - I could do with your help, actually. - Katherine... I know why Mr. Carmody is so upset, he's giving a talk on stocks and shares to the guests and, uh... he was rather anxious that I should be there. I'm sure we have time to listen to a bit of it. Any minute now, isn't it? So you're an expert on stocks and shares? It was my profession. I'm in securities. Same but different. What's this? Plonk. - What? - My Poulenc tape. To complete your musical education. It's ah... after 2:30. Well, just finish packing, and then we'll be right down. I'm not sure we'll be able to stay for all of it, but I could certainly do with a few tips. We'll say goodbye now. Have a wonderful Christmas, Gerald. And thank you for everything you've tried to do for me. Ah, well... I'll check the bathroom. Well... see you down there. Alright, who has the first question? Yes, Miss Dean. My mother invested heavily in war bonds. They yield a pittance. Um, should I sell them and invest in something with a more profitable payout? Mr. Carmody? Your-your mother didn't buy them for profit, Miss Dean, she bought them to help the country. They're what you call... perpetual bonds. They're more an act of faith than an investment. But supposing I wanted to sell them? There's not a market for them, I'm afraid. I mean-I mean, they'll keep paying out for your children and your children's children. But I don't have any children. Well, thank you, Miss Dean. And who's next? Mrs. Carmichael. I've been advised that my portfolio contains too many blue chip stocks. Consequently, I should add a few high-risk ventures. My question is: how high is high-risk? Recently, I-I was told I shouldn't gamble on a high-risk investment. But sometimes... even in business, a man must take a risk because it gives his life purpose again. I mean, others, the... the bright boys might say forget it, there's no future in it. Well, there's no use in telling him that, because there's no future without it, either. They're talking to a man who has found a reason to believe in himself again. He must follow it through, despite the risk, despite the possible heartache, because that too, is part of the bargain, part of the commitment. And there's every chance it may work, but even if it doesn't, he will be happy to invest whatever he has, for as long as it takes, because he knows the joys are everlasting. Yes, well, that seems to be a very full answer. Wouldn't you agree, Mrs. Carmichael? Yes. Well, perhaps I'd better be more specific. You see, my stockbroker went out of business some time ago, - but on his recommendation, I... - Excuse me. How very rude.
