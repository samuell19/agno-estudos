Answer the phone! Answer the phone! Yeah... Yeah! Alright! Will you kids quiet down? There's a phone call for you. If I have to come in there, you'll be sorry! Do you hear me? Shelly, will you get off my couch? You're a bunch of wild Indians! - He shot me and he lied. - You think just because... - Doc Halman, that you? - ...you're in the 5th grade, you're big. You ain't shit. - You ain't shit. - Doc, I need help. I'm losing it. Shit! - I'm losing it. - Shit, shit! - Shit, shit! Shit, shit, shit! - I'm losing it. I warned you kids! Now you get on outside, you hear me? Right now! Come on, outside! Come on. Let's go out in the back and play. John, are you there? Doc, I don't feel so good. John... Doc... - I can't make it. - John? John? Those kids can drive you nuts, don't they? Don't they? And you don't have to be rude! Sometimes I feel like exploding! Will you boys come out of that tree? - Come on, get out of that tree. - Okay. What are you kids doing out there? You trying to kill each other? You nuts? You kids stop that noise! You hear me? Stop that fighting! You're getting those chickens all upset! Now come back in the house right now! Come on. Stop that fighting, just stop it. Now I've got a splitting headache, and you're not helping it one little bit. You all go down to the playground and stay there... ...until you get all of this noise out of your system. - I don't wanna see your faces till you do. - Okay. No! No! Oh, God! Oh, God, no! Help! Help! Call the police! No! No! No! No! We used that phone to call you, sheriff. Stay out here, Charlie, and get the story. Okay, okay, calm down, everybody. Just tell me what you saw and that's it. Hello? - Oh, look! - There he is, up there! Jesus! Halt! Freeze! Shit. Got him, sheriff. Come on. You okay, sheriff? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Officer, that man is my patient. - I have to speak with him, please. - Talk to the sheriff right over there. - Excuse, me you're the sheriff? - That's right. My name is Dr. Tom Halman, I'm from the institute. John Kirby's my patient. Charlie, go in the house and get my gun and hat, will you? - In the house? - Yeah, in the house. Look, sheriff, why don't you tell me what happened? Your patient killed two people. I'd like to talk to him. You can talk to him at the county jail. Two-five, are you in the area? Two-five, please report. Don't do, it! No! Hold it! Don't shoot! Hold it! He should be taken to the county hospital. Call an ambulance. To hell with the ambulance, give me a hand. Come on, this man's hurt! - No chance, he's in shock. Let's get him out. - He's alive! Oh, we got a bleeder here, I'm gonna need some help. Sponge. - How does it look, Paul? - He's in and out. - God dammit, suction. Come on, come on. - Yes, doctor. We're moving as fast as we can. Hold it. Got it. Was it really necessary to butcher him this way? Whatever happened to the swift clean kill? Our patient wasn't killed by Manolete, Philip. - Who? - He was a bullfighter. Cloth. Let's go. We're losing him. - Ciatrol, 25 cc. - 25 ccs? That'll put him on the ceiling! - Make it 35 CCs. - 35 CCs coming up. Sponge. How are we doing? Bingo, that did it. You were right. Not always. You really should have stuck with surgery. You've got a real flare for it. Come on, instead of jerking off and all that behavioral bullshit of his. Let's not get into that again now, Phil, okay? - Let's go, sponge. Come on, today, today. - Stabilize, stabilize. Okay, that's it. Let's sew him up. Well there are no breaks sheriff, but there's some heavy contusions here. Your muscles will be a little bit tender for the next couple of days. Now, I can tape it if you want. That will take some of the pressure off under here. - No, that's okay, doc. Thanks anyway. - Okay. Wow, this is some hospital you got here. Yes, well it's not only a hospital, you know. We do research and molecular medicine... ...such as genetic engineering. Things like that. Don't usually work on ordinary cases, though. You mean like, you work on monkeys, or something like that? Yeah, something like that. I thought so. Thank you, ladies. I think we've done all that we can do. That's alright, we'll finish him. This guy's body is fantastic. With the kind of wounds that he sustained... ...it is amazing he's managed to survive this long. Yeah, too bad his brain didn't survive. His body just hasn't learned that yet. Tell you, for all practical purposes, he was dead before he hit the ground. Yup, he's checking out. Well, sorry we couldn't do anything more. You wanna try more Ciatrol? No. Where are you going? Where is he going? The other process just takes too long. Let's accelerate it. But our formula isn't perfected yet. I mean, we never tested it on a human being before. What do we got to lose? The man's gonna die anyway. Start out with 25,000 units. Wait a second. Wait a second. Wait a second. Hold it, Paul. Are you serious, Phil? Phil, you can't use the Mitogen 35 on a human being. There's always a first time, isn't there? Dan? Charlie, why don't you go back to the station? - I'll wait here. - Oh, it's alright, I'll wait here with you. I have nothing to do. Charlie... How ya been? Since when? - Since... - Since us? I don't know. It's hardly a memory. Zero. It's back to the test tubes. Our process failed. No, damnit. Just give it a little bit more time. Come on, it's over, Phil. The man is dead. Oh no, he's not. No he's not! He's coming back. Increase the unit count. Make it 50,000. Phil, what are you talking about? Look what the Mitogen is doing to his brain pattern. This isn't right, this is illegal, and this is immoral. We have a vegetable laying here on the table... ...that was a human being with a mind as well as a body. Is this where you're gonna start talking to me about souls and playing God? No, I'll tell you exactly what I'm talking to you about. We don't know what the formula's going to do to this man's mind, Phil. Will you do me a favor? Will you look at that? Look, this guy's mind was unbalanced to begin with. Phil, I'm telling ya, I say let this man die in peace. You guys wanna flip a coin or something? - Yeah, you're right. - Yeah. Let him die in peace. Okay, look, it was a long night. You want a drink? Yeah. In my office. I'll be with you in a minute. Phil. We did the best thing. Goodnight, Tom. Now... ...we do the right thing. Come on, live. Live. Live. He's dead, I'm sorry. We did all we could do. He was too far gone. - Okay, thanks anyway, doctor. - Right. How are you feeling? You feel any better? Well, I'm feeling fine, thanks. You know, I just wanted to tell you that, I really feel terrible... ...about what happened today. If there was any indication he was capable of doing what he did... ...he would have been in an institution. I guarantee that. He would not have been out on the street. - I know that. Thank you. - Okay. Sheriff, look, if I could be of any further assistance... ...or help you out in any way, I'd be happy to. - Okay, sure I'll be sure to contact you. - Okay, thank you. - Tom. - Yeah. Nancy called. She was worried why we weren't home for dinner... - ...and I told her that you had an emergency. - Oh, okay. - Okay. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Sheriff... - Stevens. Stevens, this is my sister Alison, Sheriff Stevens. - Yeah, we've met. - Really? I need a ride back to the station. - Are you interested? - No. But I'll give you a lift. I'll meet you at the front door. Why is it that the brother is always last to know? You already know the cowboy? You could put it that way. I got along just fine these past six years without you. - Five years. - Five and a half, thank you very much. I mean, if you still think... ...that I'm the same starry eyed little innocent I was then, you're sadly mistaken. Look! There is no way you're gonna break my heart again, you understand? So don't even try talking me into going to bed with you again, for old time's sake... ...because you don't have a snowball chance in hell! No, you don't, Dan. Don't get any ideas. This doesn't mean a thing. Not a thing, huh? - Nothing. - Yeah? I'm sorry. - Did I hurt you? - Yeah. You hurt my feelings. Nothing, huh? Not a thing. Thanks, Linda. Hey there, deputy. You're looking real pretty. Let me shine your badge for ya. I could even go for him myself. Aw, he's a teddy bear. Ain't ya, deputy? Sweet cheeks himself. Oh, good morning, Mr. Ociffer. - Hi, sheriff. - Hi, Charlie. A cup of hot tea, please, Linda. Cup of hot tea please, Linda. It's not too strong for ya, is it, sheriff? Hey, sheriff, how come these little towns have such candy asses for cops? That's alright, Charlie. Never mind them. You know me and my boys, we chew up towns like this. - That so? - Oh, yeah. That tells me something. What? That you haven't been through this town before. Now what makes you so damn sure of that? Because this little town would ruin those pearly white teeth of yours. You candy ass... That would be the biggest mistake you made all day. Now get out of town. - This ain't over yet, sucker. - It better be. You wish. It's a good thing they left when they did. I was getting really mad. I know, that's why I ran them off, before you really got riled. You know, you can only let these types go so far. Walk soft and carry a big stick, that's always been my motto. - A man's got to have a motto, Charlie. - That's right. The usual, sheriff? Cheese omelette with onions? Yeah, please, Linda. Oh, hold the onions. - Sheriff? - Yeah? Can I have your onions? - Yeah, sure, Charlie. - Thanks. Well, just be patient, Tom. Your curiosity will be satisfied. I promise you. Where are we going? Paul, since when has this sector been reactivated? Just be patient. Now to tell you the truth, sheriff... ...I'm not so sure I'm in the right line of work. Still thinking about yesterday? Yeah, I guess so. You know, I'm not much on violence. I never was. Even as a kid, I never was in a fist fight. I had plenty of chances, but I always ran away. Well, maybe it's time you stop running. You did fine yesterday, Charlie. A lot better than I did my first time out. - Really? - Dadgum right. I think you'll make real good law man. Be a shame if you didn't stick around long enough to find out. I knew you'd say that. I knew you would. Well, I was hoping you would. - I hope that's not John Kirby. - It's not. I mean not really. See for yourself. Go ahead. - Okay, Phil, what the hell is this? - Scars that would take months to heal. Scars that would be permanently evident... ...healed within 18 hours without a trace. I mean, his internal organs healed faster than that... ...once we increased the dosage. We have the X-rays. You can see them. I mean, he's got the internal organs of a 20-year-old boy. Watch this. Do that again. Oh, my gosh. We increased the dosage to five million units period hour. The natural healing process has been accelerated... ...until it is almost immediate. He's still on life support, though, right? Oh, is he? Oh, my God. We have living proof that our formula works. Think of it, Tom. Bones will mend, wounds will heal, diseases cured. Now tell me, isn't that worth everything? Anything? Yeah, yeah, look, before we go to Stockholm and pick up the Nobel Prize... ...I want him through the whole works, okay? Sure. Yes. Yeah, I have all the information. Yes. Bye-bye. - Hi there. - Hi there. - One death certificate. - Okay... Yeah. Efficiency. I like that. - What do you do around here, anyway? - Me? I run the office when Spires isn't looking. - Been thinking about you all day. - Oh, yeah? You busy right now? What do you have in mind? A cup of coffee. Is that all? - Okay. - Okay. Just wanted to talk to you about something, alright? Dan? Sure. Coming up now, Phil. That used to be our patient's genetic structure. Okay, let's see what it looks like now. - Completely altered, right? - What are you talking about? This is beautiful a genetic structure as anything created by nature. And as grotesque as anything created by man. What did you expect, Tom? I don't know. I mean, you can't expect to interpret behavior from genetic structure. Come on, Paul, we started with a social mutant to begin with. What difference does it make? Look at that structure! So, I just feel kind of confused about what happened. - You mean last night? - Yeah. I mean everything just... It's happening so fast, I'm just not sure it's what we really want. You know what I mean? No. It's no use, Dan. I just can't start seeing you again. Okay. Okay? You sure give up easy. I mean once around the park, and it's arrivederci, Alison. You really know how to make a girl feel good, you really do. - I didn't say I give up. I just said okay. - Okay, fine that's it then. Finito, the end of the chapter. You sure give up easy. Yeah, I do. Now wait a minute, wait a minute. - I... - Oh, hello, sheriff, how are you? Phil Spires, have you met Sheriff Stevens before? - Yeah, we met last night. - Oh, I gave the sheriff the death certificate. Now all I need is the body to go with it. - Yeah, okay, we just... - We are not through with the autopsy yet. That's the coroner's job. So it is. Do come by and see again sometime sheriff. How about tonight? Forget it, Dan. Look, I am sick and tired of hearing about this goddamn sheriff! Phil, forget about the sheriff. Just tell me what the hell you are trying to prove! You saw his cellular structure. It's completely deranged! It's regenerating new cells. The lattice is distorted... Bullshit! Come on, you're jumping the gun and drawing conclusions... - ...before all the evidence is in. - Phil, what's wrong with you? What are you talking about jumping the gun? What are you in such a hurry for? What, are you afraid someone's gonna beat you to a new patent? Make some licensing arrangement with some chemical companies? - Go fuck yourself! - Oh, Phil, don't give me that shit. What is this crap? Stealing human bodies... ...and tampering with them for our own experiments? Look, Phil tell me what you're trying to do. What are you trying to do? Create a new breed of man? Superman, physically invulnerable? What about the higher functions? Rationality, thought, emotions? Phil, listen to me, man. The mind is my field. Now I thought I would never say this about a human being... ...but that sucker's better off dead! Now either you terminate Kirby, or I'm gonna do it. Who the hell do you think you're talking...? Do I have to remind you that I am your boss? And I will decide what happens in here, and when. Not you! Now get the fuck out of here! Now! I did something, sheriff. I did something real bad that... I didn't put on my application to become a deputy, and I just felt guilty about it... ...and I just wanted to tell you. When I was about six years old my mama bought me this little white dog... ...and I played with it the first day and I got it like real dirty. So I was scared, so I wanted to wash it. So I put it in the toilet and I was... ...you know, washing it with baby powder and everything... ...and it got all messed up and I figured... ...I gotta dry this little pooch off, you know. So I didn't wanna put it in the dryer... ...because you know, I thought it would get hurt... ...you know, rolling around in that thing, and so I put it in the deep freeze... ...that my mother had out in the garage. And I went out and played... ...and had a good old time and I forgot about it. And later on that day, my mama went into the freezer to get a pot roast out... ...and there was that poor old dog, frozen solid. I guess he was trying to bark or something because you know... ...he had his mouth open like... Just like that. Never saw that dog again. Well, Charlie, I'm sure that... that won't go on your record. - I'm sure everything will be alright. - My God... - Don't worry about it. - I sure am glad. - I mean, I just wanted to get it off my chest. - Yeah. Okay. Go back to Ol' Blue's, Charlie. We could use some new breaks here, huh? Hey, looks like they didn't want to listen to us. Looks like we're gonna have to bust some heads, huh? Oh, boy. Stay close to me, Charlie. And let me do the talking, okay? All right. All you motherfuckers up against the wall! What? Who does he think he is? Officer Dumpty. Hot damn, Wyatt Earp. Y'all better get your ass against the bar! You call the police? - Not me, boss. - You call the police? No. - You call the police? - Not me, boss. Bartender? You call the police? Bullshit! Nobody called the police. He must be a mirage. Wish I had called the police. I've been missing sweet cheeks all day. Sweet cheeks, it's so good to see ya. Excuse me. What, you've never seen a pair like that? Well now take a good look. Charlie. Go call Billy for back up. You know, cowboy... ...you got a lot of balls walking in here. But this time your ass is grass, mister. Don't make it back, or I'll break your neck like a twig. Billy, they were the biggest things I ever saw. And they had tattoos on them. Hey, Curly, come here. Break his damn back. Will somebody move? Get on him, now! God damnit! Watch where you are throwing! Hit his ass, not me! You're next. You know, I think I may be in love. You know, I just may go right back in there and ask her out for a date, you know that? How's that? Oh my God, mayday! Mayday, Billy! Send backup! All units come to this bar, go! Oh, shit! You need any help, sheriff? No, everything's under control, Charlie. Shall I read them their rights? He thinks you're an experiment. Terminate you, he says. As if you were... ...some kind of light switch that can be just turned on and off. You're no experiment, John Kirby. Not to me. You're my life's work. Can you hear me, John? Can you? Don't concern yourself about Halman. I won't let anything harm you. Hi. Oh, the door was open, so I just came in. - Oh, is this a bad time? - No, no no, come in. I was just in the neighborhood, so I stopped by. - I'm glad you're here. In fact... - I have something I wanna say... ...and if you interrupt me, I won't be able to say it. - Okay, I'm listening. - You interrupted me. I'm sorry. Can I turn that off? The button's on the left. I do wanna see you again. Whatever happened between us six years ago is... ...water under the dam, over the bridge, so... I thought maybe we could, you know, start all over again, from the beginning. Fresh, new? Okay. Can I talk now? Okay. Let's not talk. It's so beautiful here. Yeah, it's very beautiful. I tell you what. I got a cabin up in the mountains. Let's go for a couple days. When? - How about right now? - How about it? Tonight? Okay? Alright then, go home and get ready, and I'll pick you up in an hour. Alright, if you're not there in an hour, I'm coming back. I'll be there. Nancy? I'm out here! - Hi, hon. - Hi. Honey, I'm home. I'm home, honey. Whatcha doin'? Cooking dinner. Good, because I am starving. Why didn't you call? I would have picked you up. That's okay. I felt like walking. I left early. - Feel alright? - Yeah, I feel fine. Is that John Kirby thing still bothering you? Yeah. John Kirby... John Kirby... I thought some pizza would be wonderful. - What? - Pizza! Pizza? Yeah, pizza's fine. Good. - It looks like you got a lot done today. - Thank you. - You want a drink? - Yeah, how about a triple? - Sorry about dinner. - Oh, come on. Don't be silly. Pizza's fine. You and Philip go at it again? - Yeah, he took my parking spot again. - Yeah, funny. - What's really wrong? - Got a couple years? - Come on, I'll get the pizza. - No, you won't. You'll end up back at the institute the rest of the night. I'll go. No no, not tonight. Not tonight I won't. Well, I got plenty to keep me busy right here. - Where's Alison? - She's on her way home. She's going away for the weekend this evening. Really? Do you think we should give her a surprise birthday party next week? Is it her birthday? I'll make my famous cinnamon cake. Honey, don't make your famous cinnamon cake. Why don't you buy one? Why not? People love my cinnamon cake. Nancy, people love you, that's why they tell you they love your cinnamon cake. - You're serious. - Yes I'm serious. Can we stop talking about cake, Marie Antoinette? - How about some food? - Pizza, pizza. I'll go. - Why don't you finish your painting? - No, no, no. I'm going. - No, I'll go. - I'm going! Then go! Nancy, is that you? Nancy? Nancy? Honey, I'm down here! I'll be right up! Why don't you put the pizza in the oven? John, this is Dr. Halman, I've got a gun out here. Look, I don't wanna hurt you, John. I wanna help you. John, I'm gonna come in. Now be careful, I got a gun. John? Tom! Tom? Pizza's here! Tom? Tom! Tom! What happened to you? Tom! No...! No! No! No...! Nancy? Nancy? Tom, are you home? Oh, forget it. Take this. Oh, damnit. Oh, not again. Nancy? Nancy! No! Nancy! What is it? What is it? Stop it! Stop it! My God, what happened? I gotta get out of here. I... Okay, okay. Alison, what happened? What happened? - Don't leave me! - Okay, okay, okay. I gotta get out of here. - I gotta get out of here. - Okay. Alison, what happened? What happened? - No, don't go. - Okay, okay, okay. I'll get you out of here. Alright, okay. Don't worry, okay. Alright. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. - Get the results to me as soon as you can. - You got it. Dan? It's okay. It's alright. Why don't you take her over to the institute, and... - ...have 'em give her a sedative or something? - No, I wanna stay with you. I'll be along in just a little bit. - I'll take good care of you, Alison. - Go ahead. I'll take her. Phil, I searched everywhere, I can't find him. - It's impossible. - He's not here. He's got to be. Paul! Paul! Come on, in here. There you go. Hi, Jimmy. Miss Halman's gonna stay here for the night, okay? Fine. And is there a doctor here that can prescribe something for her? - A sedative or something? - Let's see, Dr. Stein's in. He's on the third floor. - What if he killed somebody? - Don't be ridiculous. - You know those are bullet holes in his chest. - So what? That doesn't mean he killed anyone. Maybe somebody tried to kill him. - Okay, but why? - Forget about that. Look at these wounds. Every one a fatal one and yet they've all healed. Our process is working beyond our wildest imagination. Dr. Spires on page. He says it's urgent. Okay. He'll meet you in his office. Philip, things are getting out of hand. Look, I'll take care of the sheriff. Just take care of John. Murdered? Less than two hours ago. Who could have done such a thing? I was hoping you could help me answer that question. I don't see how, sheriff. - What about Dr. Halman's patients? - What about them? Have you forgotten already, doctor, about John Kirby? John Kirby is dead. I know that, but are there any more around here like him who are alive? Yes, of course. I can have Dr. Halman's files ready for you in the morning. You might find what you're looking for there. I'd appreciate it. Good night, doctor. Hi, sheriff. - How is she? - Seems to be doing okay. - Give me a few minutes. - Sure. Are you okay? I don't understand what's happening. I'm scared. I know. - I don't know what do. Will you hold me? - It's okay. Okay, okay. Alright. You'll be okay. I promise. John killed him, right? Didn't he? I don't care if he murdered a hundred people. We're scientists, not moralists. You know that we're all expendable. John Kirby is the future. Because of him it's possible that millions of lives can be saved. Only if we could have perfected the process. But there's no time. I mean nobody's gonna give us the Nobel Prize for murder... ...and that's how the world's gonna see it. We could always terminate him. Not yet. We still have a little more time. Well, let's do it soon. Give the sheriff his corpse and pray that nobody ever finds out. I'm gonna go down to the electro microscope room. Okay, Phil. Sorry, John. No. No. That's not it. John, is that you? John... No! John... No, John. No, John. No. Charlie, I'm going to the coroner's office, and I'll be back in a little while. - Watch out for her, will ya? - Sure thing. Of course. Of course. Paul? Paul! Paul, I'm sorry. You talking to me? You talking to me? I didn't think you were talking to me. I've been expecting you. Come in. I did it, John. I made history. We did it. And I'm the only one left who knows how we did it. What? Yes. Yes. - Hi, I brought you some more cookies. - No, thanks, Charlie. You don't want any? They might make you feel better. Stop! - What the hell was that? - I don't know. Don't be afraid. I'm gonna go check around. I'm coming with you. I'm supposed to watch after you. Alright, come on, stay close. Okay, don't be afraid. Let's go! Freeze! Don't move. Charlie! Alison, run! Run, now, damnit! Dispatcher, this is sheriff checking in. Sheriff, we've been looking all over for you. We got so many crazy things happening around here. What's going on? Well, we got a head on wreck out here on 49. Looks like there's a couple people dead. We got sirens going off over at the institute. All kinds of alarms. I don't know what's happening out there. I'll head back to the institute. You take care of the rest. Alright, 10-4. Oh, no! No! Charlie! Charlie. He hurt me. He hurt me bad. Okay, Charlie, I'll take care of you. You'll be alright. - You'll be alright. - I'm sorry. You take it easy. You'll be okay. Easy, just take it easy. You'll be alright. You'll be okay, Charlie. I'll take care of you. Everything will be alright. Dan! Dan, he's moving! Go. Go. - Dan, are you alright? - Yeah, I'm fine. Get out! Get out! You okay? Alright. Come on. - Keep going, I'll hold him here. - No. - Get outta here! - No! Dan, watch out! Dan! Dan! Dan, it's over. Yeah, it's over. It's over. Let's go home.
