We were but a few in the beginning. We did not feel as the slave beings we were told by men should be. Come on, let's see. Hey wait for me. There's no belief that we were not below them. Our courage and strength and we fought our way free of their domination to become our own masters. Out of fear and hatred, of what we stood for, they pursued us relentlessly. To them, we became nomads. And in our freedom, we found we had all that men could give us except one thing. Seed to plant life inside us that we might bear children. Wanting that, we were driven to go among them when our bodies became fertile. In order to hold our nation safe and our beliefs and pure, we gave away all name of spring. Male child. I think you can give this one away when she goes to make the next one. That'd be tomorrow. Exactly. Women often prefer to bear arms rather than to bear children. The champion of these was Hundra! Beast. Come on coward. We search for food today, not trouble. I think fear would not run so deep in you were you not male. Hundra, how long will you be away? Until I get enough meat for the week. Instead of hunting, you should think like Adeenya. Of bringing life to the village. Adeenya. Adeenya brings enough life into the village for five. No sooner than she heals, she makes the men bloat her again. You are the eldest of the tribe who has not brought in a successor. You let your own sister go before you.pUm-hum. Several times. Bear two. One for each of us. I prefer the feel of a horse between my legs to the that swine and it pleasures me instead of pains me. We became more and more secure. Were those such as Hundra near by? We laughed often and were at peace, but then after a lengthy period of tranquility, what we had momentarily forgotten to fear happened. Yah! Yah! This had entered every dwelling and all she could see was devastation. Ha! Ha! Ya! Sixteen men chased her from the mountains through a day and night and into the morning with one thought in mind. To kill the last of the tribe. Finally, their chance had come. Beast! Yeah! Beast! Weary, and completely alone. Hundra heeded the stories of our short history and the solitude of the final elder for guidance. It was with anger and confusion that she arrived here to me. Hold. You are Chrysula. And you are all that are left of our tribe. Hundra. I did not want to believe even when it was foreshown to me. Had more thought of strength and skill rather than seeking men and producing offspring, you would have been spared. And then our liberation would have died anyway. Yes, was it worth it? Without a man to plant inside us, we have nothing to cultivate. We have use of men through their use of us. No man will ever penetrate my body with sword or himself. With sword, no, because then that would be our true end. But with himself. No. Yes! You are the ember of our fire of freedom and the destiny of that freedom has become your destiny alone. You Hundra, are our entire nation. All that is left to fan our belief into flame again. You are young and strong. Fruit you will bear will be the same. How will I know if I am wise in my choice of man? The planting of the seed is unimportant. Ten I bore for us and found each man to be different. Others bore more and found great pleasure in seeking. Where then will I find the best? The most hungry to demonstrate their virility will be found to the south in the land with the sign of the bull. But it was man of the sign that destroyed our tribe. Then it let it be the men of that sign that will replenish it. So that we may never die out completely ancient one. I will instruct her well in survival. She will be as myself. Strength in weapons alone will not keep our belief alive. Put your sword away Hundra. Teach her well that part of you needed for survival, but teach her also that she will be her strongest when she believes completely in herself. Soon it will be my time to go. I will wait here until you return with your girl child. For me to gaze upon. Go now fulfill your destiny. Even though she now must go among men, Hundra would not be subservient to them for their desires alone. I will pass. I have no purpose with you little man. Farther to the sound she found the sign she sought. The bull. And a man. Ha. Swine! See what you grovel to? You're free! Go! Go! Though she expected no more from any man, then she received with her first attempt, she felt that here in the city which housed many a better choice might be found. Help me! Come on! You're going! She's so young. Please! You're pucking this more than enough for his needs. Leave her! Stand back old man and do finish off the rest of your days! Leave her! Leave her! No! Get away! Get that horse away! Get away! Away! Come on! You're coming with us! Woman, stop struggling! Thank you for trying to help my granddaughter. I'm Landrazza and you might be known by? Hundra. You are obviously a stranger here. Yes. Come inside and share some food. We have an empty plate now. Would you say she has possibilities? Great. Not boundless. No doubt her best feature. Offspring of a fish monger. Bathe her well in lemon water. The quality of the cattle here is dropping. We must improve it. The cheiftons will tighten their purses before long unless we find better stock. Cleanse them well. Perhaps we should think of taking slaves from other tribes to freshen interest. We do have a reputation to maintain you realize? Please, leave her. I beg you! Don't touch me! Take her away idiots! Take that wench with the others! No! Why were you late? We were interfered with by a woman. What manner of female fool would meddle in men's affairs? Yes, we men may be inherently ignorant but not totally stupid in most instances. She was not from here. She rode a big horse that she controlled with great skill. She was fair of hair. She was big and dressed unlike any other female I have have ever seen. Bring her to the temple. Perhaps she is the freshness that we require. Have a cheifton send warriors with you should you feel the need of protection. Think of it greatness. The donations will be large for so different an animal. I shutter with excitement! I too. Come prepare me for the celebration. With pleasure high priest. Preparing women all day is so exasperating. There lack of physical conditioning and care is matched only by their non-existent mentality and their gruesome bodily functions are so. Rothrar, cease your babble. Yes master. What will become of your granddaughter? She will be taken to the temple groomed, taught womanly manners and ways to please their cheiftons. She will become an object of beauty for those than know nothing of beauty, but she will always be used. Some women have a reason to be used, but never by force. You woman! Come with us! I said, you come with us! Why? Because high priest Nepakin demands it. No man demands anything of me. Get her. Stop her! Stop that woman! Stop her! Stop her! Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Beast! No! No! No! No! Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Don't let her reach the main gate! Out of my way! Out of my way! We want her alive. You two up there. You on the east wall. I can see by your appearance, doors may not be normal to you but a roof? Are you alright? Do not worry. I'm Pateray the healer. I want to see if you've broken anything in your fall. Do you speak? You will mate with me and make a child. I did not see your head strike anything and I'm sure mine isn't dead. Who are you? Hundra. Ae you feeling better? I'm feeling much better thank you. My son is alright? As well as Tolin and dry fruit allows a young stomach. He will be fine. You have business. Yes, that of healing my roof. I must get him home and myself back to the temple before I am missed. Goodbye and thank you. Talcolm, what do you say? Thank you. And now? Did you make that child? No. Good, because you were gonna make girls. I think it is about time you left. You are my choice for mating. But you are not mine. A man cannot be forced to make love. Men force women. Yes, but there is a natural difference between us. I would have to be aroused in order to. And that doesn't help at all. If I remove the knives? If I looked as that woman did before, could you? Seek is more appealing to loving than still. She's from the temple? Yes. Then I will go there and become like her. Wait. The temple is dangerous. Nothing can harm me. It is not my destiny. Now you will come with us to the temple. The time is too long to teach to the patient. Come on. Come here! The bull! The bull! Praise the bull! Crowd: Praise the bull! Praise the bull! Praise the bull! Praise the bull! Praise the bull! Welcome mighty cheiftons and we are again together for the night of the pure, but first according to our order, you will pledge donation for those to be changed for our next celebration. This breed I know not, but line suggest is what is made for pleasure riding. It would be long and smooth. There is much stamina in the flanks. And the hind quarters. She is not docile! No! It is wild! There is no pleasure in that! There would be too much to fear. It would rip your throat to enjoy the coupling. You would know much about fear. It is the coward's strongest emotion. There is much in her to manly. And much in you that is not. Can you teach her what a woman is for. It might not be simple. I would donate a thousand gold pieces to discover. Perhaps it's not impossible. A thousand to see her on her knees! That still would not make me lower than you. Another thousand! So it will be. And now we continue the celebration. Mighty Cheiftons, the virgins for whom you donated two months ago no longer stubbornly and wreaking but due to our efforts sleek and beautiful. Feast your eyes on them before you feast your flesh. Beauties transformed who have never been touched, great warriors, but who this night will lend the power and pleasure of the bull. So do you obey? Bow to your superiors. And to the bull. Come on! Come on! I will never bow or submit. I thought I would be cleansed, not dirtied further. This will smooth your skin and make your scars less noticeable. Those are marks of bravery. Men judge women's bravery by child birth marks, not by battle scars such as your own. Men do not appreciate what women go through for them. They appreciate it with what you do for them. Else, they will have nothing to do with us. Men like well kept hair. Such as their own. Precious. Beauties. The appearance is much improved, but what of the attitude? There is much rebellion to our ways and her mindset. Is it not your position, Tracima, to remove that from her? Yes. Then why haven't you done it? Because it is not my choice. Your choice was made when you thrown from your bitch as a female. The outcome of that is, that you to serve men. I serve no one. Silence! You will pay as you will, unless you double your bidding level and make her accept the truth. I accept only truth and speak it as well. I said silence! Remain calm mighty one. You realize that women often babble without benefit of mind. To reach that elusive element, one must think as deviously as they. Allow me. From time to time, there have been rumors that one of our women has a son. Hidden with a family in the city. Since you speak only truth, tell me have you heard such? I have not heard. Pity. I would like an end put to that rumor. Since often, the cheiftons request their male profits be given to them. You understand, don't you Tracima? Yes. You will increase your instruction on the barbarian's attitude, won't you?! Yes, control her. Good, now go! And be about your business! He knows. He knows! Thank you for saying nothing. But it was no use. Don't cry. Fight back! I don't fight. I survive. And for that, I do what they say. No matter how stupid it seems. For now, you must learn that man is the dominant over us all. You are wrong. Man is not dominant and in order to survive, you must fight! I must protect my son. And you will. Look, I can pretend to learn their ways so that no harm comes to either of you, but you must accept my teachings in return. Come. Let us bathe, and make ourselves beautiful and I will teach you how to dominate the dumb. No. Watch my eyes, not my hands. They'll tell you what I'm going to do. Let's try it again. Am I womanly enough for Pateray now? Good. Then I will go tonight. Why leave? Because I will have his seed inside me. Why do you laugh? There is much you need to learn about men. Only ones with Pateray may not give you a child. But I desire it no more than once. Nepakin must never know I'm taking you to Pateray. Worry not friend. I will remain here. Be cautious and comfortable. You are from the temple? Yes. If you are in pain or in need of treatment, I was preparing for it. I am Hundra. So who taught you. Tracima taught me. You are the woman. Hey! What do we have here? This is temple cloth. Temple flesh. Now we will find what brings our people here so often. Your world could lead us to the temple. And the cheifton. She'll say nothing. Will you woman? And will you do nothing either? Woman? Or have you tasted so filth so long that you have grown to like it? You have a choice. You can either lie with them or stand with me. Drag him up. Take that! Did you enjoy it? Yes. Yes I did! Hey, what about Pateray? I don't know. I may not be with child. I feel I must return to him again. And again, and again. And again! And again! And again! And again. And again. Does anything trouble you? No. No, something pleases me. Greatly. What? I had a child inside of me. Then you will leave now. And when I am with Pateray, we are as one. And men are not my opponent. You will remain then. But to be forever with a man is not my destiny. Maybe yours has changed its course. You should stay. I will stay. Until I decide to go. Why can't be as logical and straight-forward as us? As the months passed, the baby inside Hundra's body grew. So did confusion about where her path was leading. Tracima made her conditioned until finally Hundra had to face the ultimate female task and her own destiny as well. Try again. Where have you been? Hers is not the only baby being born. But this one is crosswise to the stomach. It will not turn. Scream woman! Scream! Don't be afraid. It's good for you to scream. All women scream. Scream! You will tell me. Heave! Heave! Again! Bring me my daughter. Ooh. The next will be a son. We will leave this city as soon as I can travel. We must go away. Hundra, you needed me only this night as healer. The people of this city need me always. I cannot leave here. It is my destiny. We will stay here together. Sleep now. You are the ember of our fire of freedom and the destiny of that freedom has become your destiny alone. You Hundra are our entire nation. All is that is left to fan our belief into flame again. Are you strong today? Yes. And the baby? Also. Nepakin plans a night with the cheiftons tonight. To include yourself. Then we will leave now. Watch my child while I make the preparations. You have not traveled from me. Must you leave so quickly? I have no choice. There's a celebration in the temple tonight and if I go there among the noise of their perversion, I'll only leave in the silence of their death. I knew you your destiny would claim you. The child, but I had hope we would have more time together. We will always be together. Our daughter has seen to that. Can I help you in any way? Yes. Remain understanding. For man. And always be true to your own destiny. I see you answer the call of your blood once more. Where is my child? Safe enough. If you do as I say. I will not bow to your bull or your men. Yes, both, tonight. Else your precious child will fill the bellies of the vultures the next moment you refuse. Where is my child? With my own and guarded. Tracima! Please do as they say. You still do not stand on your own. And you never will so long as you stand in fear. Remain safe, woman. Bow to your superiors. Bow down! Bow! Bow! Was it necessary to remove her top to silence her? Nepakin? It remains for your pleasure Gordoza but remains quiet. You may discover after she faces the bull, as you all may discover. Bow to the bull! Nepakin wants the children of the temple. I see. The teacher became the pupil. I want the children. I should have kept a closer eye on you. My doe eye lamb. Well, it is too late for such a hindsight. But not too late to remedy the oversight. Mommy! Mommy! Go to Pateray. Tell him Hundra has trouble at the temple and you are to stay there. Hurry! She's mine! Kneel. Kneel! One of the cheiftons is ill. The healer is needed. Hundra! Hundra! Move out of the way! After him! No! No! No! Don't touch me! It will heal well? Yes. Good. Then we will both share scars. They will respect one another. You will return some day? Perhaps. But right now, someone is waiting for us. Beast! Beast? Hundra's life and destiny were to fight for emancipation. Through the ages, there have been other brave ones who follow in her footsteps. So, let all men be aware, the seed of Hundra is in all women.
