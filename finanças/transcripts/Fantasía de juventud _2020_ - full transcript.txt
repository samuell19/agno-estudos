Idea, story, thing, or false perception of reality... that only exists in the mind of those who imagine it. When I wake up in the morning. That's when I see most clearly that I cannot go on like this. That's when I realize that perhaps things work differently. A shower, a good breakfast... I feel clean and I start living as a person. Suddenly it's noon, and my face is covered with sunshine. That's the best moment. Part of me starts to recover from the punishment of pleasure. The other senses it coming again... and is ready to repeat. Nightfall. My magic hour. It urges me to live life no matter where I am. To drop everything and go anywhere and do anything. A desperate war is raging inside me. It's not nostalgia, it's not anger, it's not depression, it's not fun, it's not excitement or desire. It's nothing of the sort. It's something else. It's like the smell of fresh grass on a sunny morning in May. FANTASY OF YOUTH My name is Aina T. I'm an ordinary girl. And I think that youth is overrated. What's up, girl? You're late. I know. I've known Adri since we were kids. We're neighbors and we live in the same building. We would always play on the stairs when we were little. Where is Clau? I think she's coming later. Oh... It's just that she still owes me money. Clau is my best friend. My sister. I know everything about her... and she knows everything about me. What about you? Did you take the test? Nope. What's your plan? I'll take the make-up test, I guess. But for now... Party. Actually, I'm not really up for parties. I just go out for the sake of it. I thought you were staying home today. No. I couldn't. Want a swig? Sure. Pol is here... so the night begins. I come down the stairs. I start to feel that sensation all over my body. Pol is the boy of my dreams. Without saying a word, I let him take me wherever he wants. The days go by quickly. The end of the course is near. For most of us, this is our last year here. A moment of indecision and contradiction. Between the desire to know oneself... and the personal confrontation with reality. A moment to be everywhere and nowhere. In the midst of all this confusion, I'm just trying to be honest. Simple and spontaneous. But sometimes I don't feel like myself. I feel like I'm other people. That prevents me from seeing myself. Did you leave with Pol last night? No. He'd been hitting on you all night. Yes, I know. Then? Then nothing ever happens. What class do you have next? Nothing. Literature. Want to go for a coffee? Don't you have a test today? Look what we have here. The queens of the night. Shit. I forgot your money, Adri. Well, don't worry. You have to buy me a coffee, though. Where did you end up last night? End? We didn't end anything. Pol and the others are still at Ricardo's. What are they doing there? Ricardo's parents are on vacation... and he has the house to himself. What a luxury. I've never been there. Why don't we go there now? It's a sunny day, gals. And there's a pool... There's a pool! Math class or spending the day at Ricardo's house? Easy choice when you're young... and you feel spring dressing up as summer. However, the only reason I'm here... is the remote possibility of running into Pol. You make me move, you make me dance. You make my heart beat, beat super fast. You make me move, you make me dance. You make my heart beat, beat super fast. You lift me up, you make me laugh. Baby, you're the best I've ever had. You lift me up, you make me laugh. Baby, you're the best I've ever had. Listen, Ricky. Why don't you show Claudia around? – You'd like that? – Sure. Let's go, then. Damn. You're such a pain, girl. You disappeared last night. I sprung out first chance I got. You could have come here with us. I know, but I was tired. No wonder. You haven't stopped in 4 days. Same as you. Pol was here too, you know? I love music but I'm terrible at it. It's all about getting started. I know... But I'm just really bad at it. Music is all about... listening. Now, that's something I'm awful at. When are Ricardo's parents coming back? I don't know... For me, they can stay wherever they are. We could stay here. That'd be epic. Like a community. Some clean, others cook, others make repairs... Others sleep. Such a hard-working guy. Don't tell me about work. That paper is work enough for me. Which I haven't even done yet. That paper is due on Friday, Adri. Yeah, I know it's due on Friday. It's due tomorrow, then. Tomorrow is Thursday. No... Today is Thursday. Tomorrow is Friday, isn't it? Fuck. I have to go, then. I have to go. Really? If tomorrow is Friday I better get going. You coming? I don't know... Guys, I love you and everything, but duty calls. Good luck. Adri! Throw out the trash, would you? Anything else? Come on, Adri! Remember you're doing it for the community. Fuck off, Frank. – I love you, honey bear! – Blow me! There's no way he can finish that paper on time. Are you in the same class? Yes. We're studying for our admission tests. If I'm lucky maybe I pass this year. What do you want to do? I'm still a bit lost, actually. I can't do what I want here. So I'm thinking about moving abroad next year. Many people go abroad. It's the only way. Yeah. It's getting rough. Popcorn anyone? There are moments in my life... that I don't know if they were real or just a dream. Either way, they're still part of my life. Hello? I love the smell of swimming pools. Everything changes... except for that smell. It reminds me that summer is on the horizon. Oh, my... We've spent so many summers together... I wonder if there is anything beyond that lust. Tomorrow will come soon... and now is already yesterday. When Clau has flowers in her eyes, that's because she's hiding something. Aina told me. How was it? I don't know what she told you, but nothing happened. But you slept together, didn't you? Yes. And you didn't kiss? Maybe a little. Just a little? I don't believe you. What else? Tell us. Sometimes I think about dropping everything and leaving. To run forever. I don't know if normal people have these thoughts... or if it's just an age thing... or just me. In any case, sometimes I just want to run away. To run away from the memory of those nets of melancholy. To run away from that strange emotion. To erase the pain... and depart from zero to infinity. What's up, girls? – Fuck, dude... – Hey, you know you can't rush me. How are you doing? Clau just had a date with Ricardo. You're kidding, right? And you weren't going to tell me? I'm telling you now. You caught a nice toff. Speaking of money... Clau? Aina? I don't have it. I'll give it to you tomorrow. What do you mean you don't have it? What do you mean you don't have it? I need it, you know? What do you think this is? You bring money to the supermarket, right? Or do you just say "I'll pay you tomorrow. I don't have any money"? Well, this is the same fucking thing. Always the same story. It's only money, Adri. Or not? This better be the last time, brat. – The same goes for you. – Calm down, Adri. Don't tell me to calm down. It's my money. Look, I can give you Aina's part now and she will pay me back later. Fine. Give it to me. Here. Now relax, it's only money for god's sake. Alright. I'm out of here. Are you serious? You put on this show and then you just leave? Yes. I have to go. See you around. Asshole. Didn't you find that weird? He's always so calm... I've known him since we were little kids and he'd never talked to me that way. I already told you. I saw it with my own eyes that day at Rubén's party. I told you. I told Laura too. I certainly didn't see it coming. The cake thing? Yes. The cake thing. What should we do? I don't have any money. Me neither. You know what I have, though? What can two girls with no money do... in a city where you need money to do anything? The answer is: nothing. I walked to find I slipped inside a day dream. In between a place before my time. And I tried to climb a staircase made of my dreams. But I fell down into your arms to find. I want you to know all about the things I'm dreaming. You're never gonna know 'cause I'm lost with who I am. Look... Isabel has shaved her head. I can't believe this. Who is Isabel? That girl from 10th grade. The one who always wears those red boots. Everything, no matter how small, has a story. It's Adri. No, we're at Aina's. About to go to bed. He's asking me about the candy. Should I tell him that we ate them? No, tell him we didn't. No. What does he say? He says: "Thank goodness. Those come with a little gift". What does he mean by "little gift"? Clau and I know exactly what "little gift" means. Words are superfluous. A single glance is enough to understand each other. The night is young... and so are we. How long do you wanna go out? I think I need to be safe. So do you wanna get close to me? Get away, we could wander around. Do you think we can go see the glamour and misery? So don't wait, whatever you think about it. I'm not scared to forget it all. I feel safe whenever you're looking at me. Just lay low in the capital. Whatever it takes to keep you 'round me. Don't stop, keep up, I'mma give you some. Whatever it takes to keep you by my side tonight. 'Cause when you touch me in the club... I'm in love. Say it's true. 'Cause even with her there's no me and you... It's okay. Comin' through. 'Cause being with you is what I want to do. Make it stop! Stop the damn thing! Fuck! A permanent sense of guilt. Every thing I do. Every thought I have. Every place I go. Every situation I live... makes me feel like a prisoner. I don't know why. Part of me seems to be wasting time. The other tries to hold on to it at all costs. To be honest, I'm worried about succumbing to the idea... that I will never know exactly what I have to do. You know I'm thinking of becoming a vet? Really? I thought you wanted to be a teacher. Yes. That too. There's a barbecue at Ricardo's. Should we go? I'm tired. Pol will be there. Everything tastes like spring. The days go by... and Pol is still nowhere to be found. Everything remains the same. I remember this. Me too. Since this could take a while... are you up for more vodka? Yes! We'll ask them to bring some when they're back, then. Look at the lovebirds. You got lost in the woods, didn't you? Shut up. Let's find out who's next. Number 5? Me! You know what you have to do. Number 7? That's you. Me. This is getting interesting. Don't take too long. We want to play too. Poem to myself: Love blossoms inside me. My mind overflows. I can't stop thinking about him. Why didn't you come last night? Why weren't you there? Your absence feeds my desire. Love blossoms inside me. My mind overflows. What do you plan to do, Aina? The course is about to end and your attitude hasn't changed. Not to mention your grades, which keep getting worse. You skip class, you don't submit your assignments, you don't show up for tests... I have a full stack of doctor's notes with your name on them. Do you really go to the doctor that much? Yes. Don't try to fool me, Aina. You're not going to get anything out of it. Tell me what's going on. Nothing's going on. Don't you think it's about time something happens? I guess... But what for? To be fulfilled... To... You are smart. If you're not passing the tests it's because you don't want to. I know, but you don't understand. What is it that I don't understand? Tell me. Forget it. You think I don't know this feeling? Believe it or not, I was young once too. The course is almost over, Aina. Seize your time. You know what you have to do. You might be young, but you're not a little girl. Did you get told off by Cubi? Just a little. He was pretty soft on me. Lucky girl! He's been in a very good mood lately. He told us the other day that he is retiring this year. He's quite old, isn't he? He's been teaching for thirty years. Adri! Let me try. You will get hurt. Just hold me. If you break an arm, I had nothing to do with it. Such a gentleman. What's up? Wanna go to the beach? Aina T. Beach, summer, sunshine... I can't. It kills me but I can't go. Well, I'm going. Tell Cubi that I'm not feeling well today. No matter how much you want to do something, there's always that other thing you have to do. I wish I could go to the beach, or any other place, to feel free. No matter how much I write about this, nothing can't make up for lost time. Cause what I really want... and what I really need... is something that'll make me feel good. Cause what I really want... and what I really need... is something that'll make me feel good. Hello? It's me. Shit... I'm with Ricardo. But we were meeting today. I know, but... Can I come in, at least? Well... I think it'll be better if... I don't know. Okay, but you owe me. Stop it! Unexpected events always lead to unexpected paths. Excuse me. Are you... Yes. What's your name? Aina. Nice to meet you, Aina T. I've read some of your books. Oh, yes? I love them. Don't waste your time reading my books. You should be reading the nice stuff. Like Proust or Harry Potter. Want to sit with me? I'd love to. Waiter! Bring me another one. What do you want to drink, Aina? A beer. A beer? And a beer! What's a girl your age doing in a place like this? Are you waiting for something to happen? No... I just needed to use the restroom. And you have to go? I guess so... I'll be right back. How old are you? Does it matter? Seventeen? Eighteen. My guess is sixteen. You're a student? Sometimes. Good answer. You like literature? I think I do. I enjoy reading and writing. So, you write? I've written a few short stories, but they're terrible. Would you mind if I took a look at them? Seriously? Yes, seriously. I want to know your fantasies. Thank you. It would be an honor if you could read some of my stories, sir. Don't call me sir, please. It makes me feel very old. Okay. It makes me feel a bit uneasy too. I'm not used to it. It's not very personal. Can I ask you something about one of your books, Fernando? I guess you can. There's this passage at the end of 'Loving you', when Ramiro is awaiting for his death in front of king Arises. He says that he doesn't fear death. He feels pride knowing that he's going to die young. Why? I don't understand. Even when the character dies, his youth remains alive. Ramiro is aware that death can't take away his youth. Only time can. I still don't understand. Why don't you ask yourself this question in a few years? Maybe now is not the right time. If you can't find the answer then, you know where to find me. FANTASY OF YOUTH Aina, are you okay? Yes, I'm studying. Your teacher called. He says you barely go to class. It's only been a couple of days. Ask me if you want. Have you eaten? No. I'm not hungry. Sometimes I feel my life is a blank sheet. Nothing is written on it. Millions of things are happening around me, but my sheet remains blank. Nothing is written on it. Seen up close, though, written words aren't so important. A book. A poem. A verse. A kiss on the lips. Deep down, it's something insignificant. Like everything else. Like everyone else. Like all those tiny people who walk around like ants. Where does everybody go? Where does all this go? What about me? Where am I going? What will become of me? Will I remember these moments in the future? Can anyone solve this problem? I'm a person. Every day is the same. All of them are 24 hours long. Night and day. Sadness and happiness. The only thing I don't have is the only thing I desire. I'm a person. What do we have here? The missing girl. How do you do? Have you heard from Clau? Yes. She's at home. She'll come later. What about you, Adri? Have you finished your paper yet? I wish. Please, don't bring up the subject of the paper. What's the plan? No plan. No rush. Pascual says he's coming up. Should we hide from him? Hey! Where are you going? I reach you and I freeze. We're so close... and yet more distant than ever. Why do we let this moment slip away without doing anything? Why do we let time go by, knowing that it never stops? Why doesn't happen what is supposed to happen? I'm here. I can't see you. I'm parking. Two minutes. I'll be late. Wait for me, please. We're in the subway. Two more stops and we're there. Spring is coming to an end and fairs arrive. Over the years, we've stopped riding the attractions. Either because of money or laziness. Even if the excitement is still there, now the joy of partying lies in the most absurd things. Every year comes to an end... and gives way to new years and new generations... that will take new centenaries. But in this long-awaited conclusion... I still don't know where my place is. I'm unable to decode the message. – It's out of order! – What do you mean it's out of order?! Order, please! Hello! We'll have a... a happy box, right? Happy box! A happy box... A happy box... Nuggets and... What do you want for dessert? – A happy ice cream! – A happy ice cream... A McFurry. - – Yes, the regular one. - McFurry! I just farted! – Let's see if I can remember... – Careful! Do you want a nugget? – Yes, I'd like a nugget. – Nope. What is this? Who do you think paid for all this? Everything is changing. Again. Everything is upside down. I look upon my city. I don't know why, but every time we go up the hills... the city looks smaller. I feel the wind. I feel the perfume of summer. Again. The feeling is back. Again. I don't want this to end. I'm home alone. A song comes through the window. I can't stop replaying the same moment in my head. I try to hold it with resolute love... because I don't know If I'll ever feel the same again. So, we have two groups here. The first group are the derivatives. Then, there's the second group, which we must... Girls. Can you put your phone away and listen? The end of the course is almost here and you'll be lost. If you go on like this I'll have to take them away from you. Okay... Where were we? Ricardo organized a costume party... to surprise Clau and celebrate her birthday. When friends celebrate their birthday or remind you of their age, you suddenly feel as if it was your birthday too. My best friend. My sister. The only person that listens to me... and has the ability to straighten me out with just a smile. Clau is getting older. Tonight we're all going to get a little older too. Asshole! I wanted to tell you so many things... Your face, your nose... Have you seen Pol? I think he's with Saray. What's the matter? Michael doesn't want to dance? I'm tired. Want a sip? Got a cigarette? No. I think I'm going to buy a pack. Can you bring some ice too? I think we ran out. Sometimes I don't know if I'm special or stupid. I can't wait any longer. I need something to happen... but nothing ever happens. I don't know what I want. I am frustrated by everything and nothing. I feel sad and happy at the same time. I am amazed at myself and my environment. I always expect a lot from others, and sometimes I forget about myself. I can't wait any longer. In life, you can't deal with anything unless you deal with the truth first. Let's take a break, girls! I guess you're here to talk about Pol. I know he's not going to tell me. I just wanted to ask you if you're together now... or if something happened. Yes, we're together. We have been seeing each other for around two months now. Pol told me there was nothing between you and him. There's nothing between us... It's just that I'm in love with him. Well... Thanks for telling me. You're very good. Keep it up. Last year. Last day. Last test. You prepare your whole life for this moment... and when it comes you feel as if everything had happened in a flash. My sheet is still blank. Nothing is written on it. No before or after. No answers. If such things exist at all. Here we go! Take hope as we're floating through the sky. I want you to know all about the things I'm dreaming. You're never gonna know 'cause I'm lost with who I am. And I know that time is wasted for true imagination. So leave it all behind us now. I want you to know all about the things I'm dreaming. You're never gonna know 'cause I'm lost with who I am. I want you to know all about the things I'm dreaming. What are you doing, sister? Are you up? I hope you are. I'm at the park and I thought... We could meet up if you feel like it. I don't know... Please, get back to me. Excuse me. Have you seen a blond girl? No, I'm sorry. You're in 11th grade, right? Yes. How do you know that? I've seen you in the hallway. What's your name? Pau. My name is Aina. I knew that too. Aina T. Let's go, Pau! I have to go, Aina. See you around. What's wrong? Nothing... Ricardo. What's the matter? He left me. What happened? I don't know... He texted me today saying that... he needed time for other things. You had a fight? No... I don't understand. Let it go. Young love. You come and go as you please. A perfume that you will never forget. Feelings sprout up inside you, dear. For the first and last time. When young love fades away... you know it's forever. As everything advances, I stop for an instant. My moment. I feel as if life was just an echo. Everything is ephemeral. I realize there's only one beginning and one end. Nothing ends. Nothing concludes. Everything goes on. In the end, time will erase us all. As if we were perfume or music. But as long as I exist, you will exist too. And this feeling will remain with me. In my essence. In my being. Nothing ends as long as we exist. Everything goes on. Perhaps one day a tear will fall from our lost gaze... and we'll be surprised to see that we don't advance in vain, my friends.
