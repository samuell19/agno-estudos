Kit? Wake up, Kit. Dad? Everything's okay, honey. Everything's okay. Everything's okay. Everything's okay. Everything's okay. Everything's okay. And I realize now that my behavior needs improving. But I really feel like I have my anger under control now, and I'm ready to move past all this and really let go of the past too. I mean, the therapy, working with you all this time, it's helped me to understand that... my behavior needs to change. So, thank you. Really. Thank you. Two suspensions, a misdemeanor arrest, and a still-pending arson charge. I didn't do it. Not that. Oh, and an "F" in gym. How does anybody even get an "F" in gym? - I never go to effin' gym. - Kit! That's what we're up against, right here. Look, if... Who the hell is she? As I said, I'm Dr. Sinclair. Yeah, but why are you here? One therapist at a time is plenty. - I'm not a therapist, Kit. - You said you're a doctor. PhD, 19th-century literature. Honey, Dr. Sinclair represents a school. Actually, it's more of an academy run by a remarkable headmistress, where girls like you, Kit, have gone on to do incredible things with their lives. Girls like me end up on meds and in and out of offices like this for the rest of their lives. - That's not fair. - All that could change, Kit. It's an option, Kit. We don't have many of those left. What was that girl's name, the one that doctor said went to that school? - The painter? - Her too. The point is, this school, Blackwood, it sounds legit. - "Legit." Yeah. Thanks, Dave. - Don't be mean. - And call him... - No, I'll call him "Dave". - Dave. - I actually prefer "David." Like I said, it's an option. - Well, I opt against it. - You made your own bed with all of this. - You still don't believe me. - I know that your lawyer didn't, but that didn't stop him from charging me. - You're my mother. - That is right. I am. You're starting at Blackwood next week, Kit. Are you... Are you kidding me? I said the same thing. Place is frickin' expensive. But, you know, totally worth it. So what was all that bullshit about options, then? Pretty much bullshit. It's stupid! So, that went well. Do you remember when that was taken? We were going for a hike one day. You had just turned six a few weeks before. So we thought the hike would be too much for you, but you were determined to try. You started it, and you finished it. Because that's the way that you were. Of all the things your father admired you for, I think he admired you most for that. For hiking? For trying. ♫ Elevator straight into my skull ♫ ♫ The escalator rises as it falls ♫ ♫ I swear our jet is crashing in my mind ♫ ♫ Farewell, my black balloon ♫ Holy shit. Oh, wow. Kit? Honey? Come on. Hello? Hello! Oh, my. Jeez. How old do you think that chandelier is? Ten thousand years old? I don't know. It would be 207 years old, were it not an appallingly bad replica. - Welcome to Blackwood. - "Madame Durette"? Duret. And this is Miss Orlonsky. Hey. - Where are the other students? - They don't arrive until tomorrow. - Why did you bring me here today? - Not now. Allow me to show you to your quarters, Kathryn. I'm afraid it only gets darker. The electrical system is very old, and getting an electrician can be a bit complicated all the way out here. So how do you see? Your eyes will adjust, I assure you. Will your honor us tonight with your presence? Oh, we'd like to, but we have to get back. Kathryn. That part of the building is off limits to the students. It isn't perfectly safe. - Where does it go? - Please. This is where you'll be sleeping. At Blackwood, we believe beauty enriches the spirit. It's definitely dramatic. A young woman should be at ease among lovely things. Don't you agree? Back up, lady. Well, Miss Duret... - May I ask where the ladies' room is? - Of course. Just down the hall. Follow me. - She's changed. - Changed? She's... She's not my little girl anymore. Nor should she be. She's 17. No, what I mean is... It's her mental state. It's... It's so aggressive. Listen, Kit. If things get weird here, just call us, okay? It's already weird here. - Yeah. - Hey. This is going to be good for you. Even with my aggressive mental state? Come here. I love you. So much. I just want what's best for you. Okay. Hello? Madame Duret? Hello? Hello? Huh. Yeah, much better. - Oh. Good to know. - Dinner. Medicine. Can I see it? Yep. That's the stuff. - What? - Show me. Are you kidding me? Thanks. This definitely doesn't suck. Who's there? Hello? ♫ Elevator straight into my skull ♫ ♫ The escalator rises as it falls ♫ ♫ I swear our jet is crashing... ♫ - Ah. There you are, Kathryn. - Uh, I thought that... Fall in line, please. Hi. I'm Ashley. Kit. Veronica. That's a bold look. Allow me to welcome you all to Blackwood. Wait. That's it? There are only five of us? We accept only truly gifted individuals. Trust me, I'm not gifted. But I assure you, Sierra, you are. There's a talent inside each of you, and I intend to find it. Now, in order to thrive here at Blackwood, I will need your absolute attention, no distractions. So Miss Orlonsky will be collecting your cell phones. - That's not fair. - What? You will each get one call to someone of your choosing in the middle of the term. That's it? One call? - Did you tell our parents? - This is ridiculous. - I want to speak to my lawyer. - This is so stupid. This is so dumb. - This is stupid. - Give me... - We'll get Internet though, right? - I'm afraid not. - What? - Is this a joke? It's an alternative to prison. You've hurt people, destroyed property, made life difficult for those around you. Arson, grand larceny, drugs, assault, and all of the above. Your choices have been yours and yours alone, and the consequences of your actions have brought each of you here. That sounds an awful lot like what they say when you get to prison. Look around, all of you. There are no bars on the windows. And while we are rather remotely located, it's entirely possible to reach the nearest town. But why would you? My terms may seem harsh, but the price of an extraordinary life is an extraordinary effort. And make no mistake, each one of you is quite extraordinary. In your old lives, people ridiculed you, they punished you, they cast you out, they laughed at you. If you follow my instruction and allow me to raise you to the great heights I know you can reach, no one will ever laugh at you again. You a creeper or something? - No, I was just... - Staring in some bitches' rooms? I'm not a creeper, or whatever you said. You're her, aren't you? What are you talking about? There's always at least one. Someone who thinks I won't smother them with a pillow while they're asleep, until I smother them with a pillow while they're asleep. Well, you'd better bring more than a pillow. Do you two mind killing each other somewhere else? Some of us are trying to hate this place in peace. Dinner is ready. Sorry. Arithmetic, art, literature, music: the four pillars of knowledge. That will be your core curriculum here at Blackwood. Do we have to wear those uniforms? Let me introduce your mathematics teacher, Professor Farley. And for literature, whom I believe some of you have already met, Dr. Sinclair. And proving his excellent timing at this very moment, your music instructor, Jules Duret. Wait. - "Duret," Duret? - Jules is my son. He just received his degree from the Royal Academy of Music in London. We're all thrilled you're here. Madame Duret has carefully chosen each one of you. For what? For greatness. I understand you used to play piano. I'm excited to hear you play. Don't be. I haven't played since I was nine. Well, then, your bad habits won't be hard to break. - I can play the flute. - That's wonderful. All of you, please, enjoy. Right, my numb pills. Always nice chatting with you. Your first essay is on Proust's In Search of Lost Time. - How long do we have to finish it? - Five days. What? Five days? The thing's a brick. Which, if the Three Little Pigs have taught us anything, is the perfect material to build a strong foundation. Why can't we just read that instead? - What do we have to write about? - Ah. Love. Needing it. Finding it. - And what it means to lose it. - So it's a love story? In a way, yes. Every story is. Anyway, let's get to it. Does anyone know how to make pink? Shh! Girls. Focus. What's this? This is Blackwood, and this is fire. And you're... somewhere in there, screaming for help or something, I don't know. And you're proud of this? I think it's a work of art. Do you know what I see when I look at this? I see a young woman that's frightened to death she doesn't have the talent to survive here. Perhaps she's right. It isn't atrocious. - Does that mean it's good? - Far from it. Carry on. Mathematics. Everything in this world can be explained with mathematics. What does that explain? I have no idea. I was hoping one of you could tell me. As Galileo said centuries ago, "The great book of nature can only be read by those who understand the language in which it was written, and that language is..." - What the hell is wrong with you? - What's happening here? - She lit my hair on fire. - Then why isn't your hair on fire? Aah! Ladies, please. Get off me! I believe she's learned her lesson. Okay, okay, stop, please. That's enough. - It's been a while. - Giovanni Pergolesi, Franz Schubert, Mozart, William Kestler. All were virtuoso composers who, sadly, died by age 40. The aim here is to find what best suits you. - Which instrument? - You are the instrument, Izzy. All of you. We simply need to find which of these devices... because that's all they are, devices... best express your artistic spirit. You're going to help me. I'd bone him. Kit. Come in. Just give me one moment with this, please. Were they all your mom's students? That is her wall of fame, yes. She's been teaching for many years. London, Paris, Berlin... None of those places were worth staying in? She wants me to start working with you outside of our classroom instruction. Apparently, she saw a musical quality in your painting. You are aware of, like, technology, right? I always found analogue recording to be warmer. - You're not recording this, are you? - Would you like me to? No. Definitely not. Then I won't. Sorry. That's, um... You're holding back. It's just... Um... - I can't. - Yes, you can. But you're too much in your own head. Why? My dad... I've been thinking about him lately. We used to own a small upright piano. He bought it for me when I was little. Why does that make you sad? He died. I mean, it happened a long time ago. I was only nine. Um, he was on his way back from a business trip, and... the weather was bad, so... Guess he should've taken the next flight. They're never far, you know? Part of them carries on well after their final note is struck. Do you really believe that? This isn't an easy process, Kit. Nor is this the happiest place in the world, I give you that. But if you trust me, and if you give all this a chance, if you try, I promise you you'll be amazed at what you're capable of. "The tenderness is gone, gone. Fear all that I have said, love, but divide your senses, for you alone are the maker of light. Castles and castles and castles of silk. The tenderness is gone." It's beautiful, Ashley. There are traces of the Romantics, of Keats, of Byron. But no, the tone, the meter... there's something altogether different. - There's an incongruity to it. - Where did you copy it from? I didn't copy it. It just sort of came to me. Excellent. Quite excellent. You're fast becoming the princess of mathematics, Izzy. Sierra? Sierra! Excellent work, Sierra. Listen to it. Hear it. The wind. The creek. It's a symphony. Can you hear it? Yeah, I think so. "How happy I am to walk among the woods, the trees, the rocks, for the woods, the trees, the rocks give man the resonance he needs." Beethoven said that. Close your eyes, Kit. Completely. Listen to it. I can't hear you. I'm here. - Open your eyes. - Dad? - Kit? - Uh... - You okay? - We were at the river. Yes, for almost three hours. - Did you bring me here? - I would say you brought me. Oh. Right. Of course. Dinnertime. Come on. Let's go. Enough for today. Allez, allez. My apologies. Kathryn and I were by the creek. Doing what, exactly? We were... listening. May I go to my room? I'm not hungry. I need to get back to my work. Of course, darling. Work comes first. Miss Orlonsky will take care of you. Listening to what, Kit? Oh. Uh... It was like... trees, wind, nature stuff. I think that one's right after all. - So you're, like, a genius or something? - I barely passed algebra. I can't explain it. Any of it. But I like it, being good at something. Not being the one that everyone always thinks is broken. I like it. Don't you? Get away! Get away! Ashley? Ashley! Ashley! Let us in! Ashley! Ashley? Ashley! Hey, wake up. It's just a dream. Ashley, wake up. - What was that? - What was what? What did you see? Hey, Ashley? It's just us. It's okay. Is he gone? He... He hurt her. - Hurt who? What are you talking about? - Elizabeth. Elizabeth... The woman that... she brings me words. What's her problem? - What are you doing? - Shut up. - No, you shut up. - No, there's somebody out there. - Orlonsky? - No. Uh... - I don't know. - It's him. The man who attacked Elizabeth. - The man from my dream. - Who is Elizabeth? - Uh, I'm going to bed. - Veronica, don't. - Get off me. - Veronica, don't! Touch me again, and I'll choke the life out of you. Slumber party? Why choose us? - For what? - To come here. Because we're screw-ups. So are a lot of girls. Maybe those other girls didn't apply. - I didn't apply to Blackwood. - You applied? - No, I guess I didn't. - They found me. Dr. Sinclair showed up at my therapist's office after I was accused of setting my school on fire. - "Accused"? - What did he look like? The man from your dream? - Scary. - Really. Go to sleep. All of you. Should we tell Madame Duret? What, that Ashley had a nightmare? That Kit saw something in the hallway. - I don't know what I saw. - I told you. - It was that man-woman Orlonsky. - Then why didn't you open the door? Because last time Orlonsky nearly ripped her face off. That wasn't Orlonsky. I've seen something like that before. - Some scary guy? - No, he wasn't scary. He was my dad. Of course, about eight different therapists tried to convince me otherwise. He came to me. It was the same night he got into his accident. I think he wanted to... I don't know. Just wish I had the chance to say something. Like what? - Goodbye. - It was a dream. Ghosts aren't real, even when you want them to be. Wow. Someone's an insensitive douche. - She's telling the truth. - How do you know that? - Because I've seen things too. - Like what? Things. Things you can't explain. I bet you I can. - Since when? - Since always. - Kind of. But it's more that I can... - Feel them? I never knew what it was. This feeling, like... something was always around me, following me. I never said anything, and when I finally did, they... They said you needed friends. Or pills. Or you needed to be put away. Some gift we have. Madame Duret? Ah, Sierra. I was just looking at your latest piece. Personally, I prefer your more naturalistic efforts, but who am I to argue with inspiration? - Thank you. - Uh... - We wanted to ask you a question. - Jules tells me you're making excellent progress too, Kathryn. There was something in the hallway last night. Maybe even in Ashley's room. - And you saw this something? - Yeah. Yeah, we did. I'm surprised it took you this long. - Are you still taking your medications? - Yeah. With powerful chemicals like that, you're bound to have nightmares. - But we all saw it. - I didn't see anything. Look at me, all of you. It's the state that prescribed those drugs, not me. - They help sometimes. - They dampen your creative spirit. You girls don't need to be fixed. Damn anyone who tells you differently. If it were up to some people, all the greats would be labeled mad. The world would still be flat, and powerful women like us would be burned at the stake. A bit dramatic, don't you agree? - As of now, no more pills. - You can do that? I just did, provided that all of you in return agree to redouble your efforts. Good. Hmm? Carry on. That was beautiful, Kit. Oh. How do you know that music? - Uh... - Huh? I don't know. It's like I've, um, heard it before. Like I was remembering it. Remembering William Kestler's music? Yeah. I don't get it. I never got nearly this good when I was taking lessons before. I wish I could take the credit. Of course it's because of you. I mean, you studied at the Royal Academy of... I don't know, wherever. You're a genius. I'm skilled and disciplined, but as my mother is fond of telling me, I am categorically not a genius. Maybe she's wrong. - What I'm telling you is... - Save your breath, Jules. I shouldn't have to remind you of the importance of the role you play. We are their guides, not their teachers. They have found a path. Our function is to keep them on it. At any cost. I see your etiquette has not improved, Veronica. Is Sierra sick? She hasn't been out of her room in days. - She's been painting. - When's the last time she ate? I think I have to go back to my room too. - I believe this one is yours, yes? - Yeah. Can I take it in the hall? The charger. - Mom. - Honey, hi! Dave, it's Kit. - Sweetie, can you hear me? - Yeah. Yeah, I can hear you just fine, Mom. Sorry about the noise. How are you? How is everything going? - It's perfect. - Really? Yeah. That's the truth. Are you okay, honey? He gave a thumbs-up. His mouth is full. Kit, I wish that we could speak more often. - Me too. - So have you made any friends there? Not really, Mom. Thanks for asking. Why? You're not getting into trouble, are you? No. No, I'm not. But, you know, you don't sound like yourself. - I'm just... - Kit. - Honey, is everything okay? - Yeah. Yeah, I just miss you. Oh, we miss you too, but... - Is something wrong? Because you sound weird. - No, no, everything's fine. Honey, if something is wrong, let us know, and we will come get you. - Yeah. - Yeah? Mom, I really got to go to class now, okay? Okay, I love you, bye. May I be excused? Kit? It's the last poem that I wrote. This is disgusting. Sorry. She's not coming anymore. - What are you talking about? - She's not visiting me anymore. - Ashley, hey. Hey. - There's someone new... who's taking over. - What? - The men inside my head. - They're so angry. - Listen to me. Hey, listen to me. We're gonna be okay. We're gonna die here. Sierra? Sierra! Sierra? I'm... I'm... I'm so thirsty! Sierra, who's... Who's there? Boo! What are you doing here? Thinking on setting this place on fire. - That's more your thing, isn't it? - Look at this. - Seriously, look. - Why are Sierra's paintings in that book? That's just it. They're Thomas Cole's. - Fabulous. Who is he? - He was a painter. - He died in the 1800s. He was only 46. - So... So Madame Duret has the exact same landscape in her office, only it's from a different angle. And Sierra is signing her paintings "TC" too. Ashley said her words were coming from someone named Elizabeth, right? And when Dr. Sinclair read Ashley's poem in class, how did she describe it? She said it was "incongruous". "Before her untimely death at age 27, Elizabeth Webb's work was considered the bridge between Romanticism and Transcendental poetry, with echoes of Blake, Byron and Keats. Webb's 'incongruous' stanzas and unusual preoccupation with castles were likely what led her contemporaries to secure a more lasting place in history than she." And I am composing Wilhelm Kestler music, for God's sake! I was wrong. All you bitches aren't crazy. It's just you. Veronica, wait! Wait! Veronica? Veronica! Hey. Veronica? Veronica? It wasn't easy. Help! Help! You saw them! You saw them, right? Not in here. I was never worried about them. I saw things. Yes. Strange things. But... I refused to let it matter to me. I had real problems that mattered. When I was 13, I went to the zoo to see the giraffes with my friends, and... What? Giraffes are cool. When I came home, my mom was screaming. My stepdad was beating the living shit out of her. Don't make the sympathy face. It happened all the time. But this time... I grabbed a knife... just a small, dull kitchen knife... and I stabbed him in the chest. Did he die? But he never touched her again. My mom thought if she kept her head down, the beatings would eventually stop. Bad things never stop on their own, Kit. I think I know where to start. I'm not going first. Beginner's luck. What... the hell? Let's go down. How big is this freakin' place? Holy shit. Let's go. Shit. Beginner's luck. Shit, hide, hide! Such a shame. We had such high hopes for you, Veronica. I have a habit of disappointing. Kind of my thing. Hmm. Are you... alone on your little late-night fact-finding mission? I hate people. You know that. I hate you. I have been so patient with you, trying to make something worthwhile out of something so utterly worthless. Perhaps I should have done more. Or perhaps with some people, there's simply nothing more one can do. Rather than cooperate or appreciate what was offered here at Blackwood, you have made it your mission to squander every opportunity I've given to you. So now, dear girl, I give you to them. Sierra! Sierra, wake up! We have to go! Ashley! Ashley, let me in! We have to go! My baby. You promised me I would see my baby. Be patient. The connection is getting stronger. She seems rather awake. It doesn't matter. Don't be afraid, child. Everyone is here for you. Just be a vessel for the music. Play my music. Now. Not everyone is a true artist. Ignore him. The door. I've never come this far. You're doing so well, child. Dad. It's my turn now! Wake up again. Why am I here? Why am I here? - What's happening to me? - Shh. Everything's okay. - Everything's... - No. - Everything is okay. - What are you people doing to me? - You came down to practice? - No. No. - Where is Veronica? - I don't know. - Stop lying! - I don't know, Kit. I'm not lying. All I know is, my mother is dissatisfied with her progress. Are you recording this? Always make sure you get back to your room safely, Kit, okay? But this way we have the music. - For posterity, Kit. - No, no! No! I trusted you! You're giving the world something beautiful here. Think of the music. Mozart and Schubert, they died so young. William Kestler was 33 when he died. Can you imagine? Think of the great artists and the genius minds... No! Stop! - Kit, he had so much more to give. - No! - Kit, please. - No! They had their time. They are not taking mine! Get everyone down here. Now! Why did you wake all of us up? Where is everyone? Where is Veronica? - Veronica is no longer with us. - You're a liar. You are all liars! - Mother, she needs to hear the truth. - She won't understand. Oh, I understand, all right. I was up in the attic. I saw all your files. I know what happened to those other special girls. - Kit... - You used them. You used them, just like you're using us. - You should be grateful for the privilege. - Grateful? - I'm grateful. - Being possessed just to learn how to play piano is a privilege? You stupid girl. Don't you understand? You didn't learn anything. You can't play an instrument at all. You girls are their instruments. We all have our gifts. Mine is to commune with the other side. Your gift, the gift all you girls have, is that you are vessels. Vessels for what? Madame Duret helps these men and women to speak through you girls to finish their work. You could hardly play a scale when you first arrived. Now you're composing concertos. Sierra couldn't paint her nails. Now her work will grace gallery walls. Ashley's poetry is on par with some of the greatest ever written. And Izzy has nearly figured out one of the most elusive theorems mathematics has ever known. And once she does, then what? He claims he figured it out? My dear, artists since the dawn of time have been searching for this. The ultimate source of inspiration. The muse. People have drugged themselves, starved themselves, driven themselves mad with rage and killed themselves when the muse disappeared. Yeah, and you hang their paintings in your lobby with pride. Or maybe you sell them. This is not about pride or money, child. This is about giving back to the world the genius physical death has stolen. And I have chosen you, plucked each of you from obscurity, saving you from your little lives of misery and delivered the muse directly into your hands. Then get it out. Now! Sometimes when the door to the other side is opened, it's difficult to control what comes in. - But we're here to help you. - You people are crazy! - Kit... - Stay back. All of you. Wouldn't you like to see your father again, Kathryn? Stay. Let us finish the work, and your connection to him will remain intact. Leave, and he'll be gone. This time, forever. - Kit... - Leave her, Jules. She can't go far. Wait for me, please. Kit, one second, please. Please, listen to me one second, please. Kit... Get off me! Leave me alone! Don't touch me! - Don't hurt me! - Ashley. - Please, no! Get him off! Get him off me! - Make him stop! - Ashley? Ashley? No more. I won't let you. - It's me, Kit. - Stop. It needs to stop. It's me. We need to get out, okay? - We can take care of this. - Please? We need to get an ambulance! What are you talking about? Ashley, I'm gonna be right back. - Kit, wait! - Please, make it stop! Kit, wait! - For the office. - Thank you. Ashley? No. No. - Ashley! - Kit! Kit! Wait! - Okay, let's go! - Go! Hurry! Go! Okay. Please work. Please work. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Yes! Okay. Okay. Sierra. Sierra, wake up. We have to go. Sierra. No! Izzy! Izzy! Izzy! Let me in! Open the door! Open up! It's me! - We've got to go. Come on. - They killed her. Sierra is dead. And Ashley. - Let's go. We have to go. - I think I've got it. - The answer is three, okay? - How? Get out of here. I'll find Veronica. Let's go! - It will be dealt with. - We're all in danger. - Don't question me. - It's out of control. - It's gone too far this time. - It could go farther. The connection's the strongest it's ever been. I realize that, but surely you can see... There's a price to pay for what we seek. I'm in complete control. Let's not pretend we're suddenly unaccustomed to this. For these miscreants to know brilliance, much less to be in its possession, it's worth the pitiful lives they sacrifice. They are not vessels. They are donors. Cops are coming. What have you done? All of the work I have done. How could you? And you? How could you betray me like this? My own son? - Aah! - Stay where you are! I'll deal with the police when they arrive. Take her away. - Jules! - Let go! Let go of her! No! Jules! Look what a pathetic thing you've become. So weak. Just like your father. But at least he had the good sense to leave you. Stupid, stupid girl! Stupid! You don't have to do this! Ungrateful girl. You are not the only one who misses someone. No! Let me out! Let me out! Please? Veronica? Veronica, it's me. It's Kit. What have they done to you? Kit? You have to fight. That's what you're gifted. You have to fight. You know this isn't right. Come on! Do it! You have to fight, Veronica! Veronica, you have to fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight it! Fight! Fight it! Fight! Fight it, Veronica! Veronica. Veronica, we got to hurry. Let us out! Please? Please, let us out! Kit? Is that you? I need your help. It's just too many numbers now. Give them a thousand each. If that's not enough, give them more. What if they ask to search the... No. Izzy! Come on! We got to go! We got to go, Izzy! - Izzy, no! Izzy! Come on! - I belong here. Izzy, look at me. You don't belong here. - It's so beautiful. - Kit, come on! It's so beautiful. Go, Kit. Go. You don't belong! Come on! Kit, come on! This building is going to collapse! We have to go now! - Izzy! - Kit! Come on! No! - Kit. - Are you okay? - Jules, are you okay? - No. Come on. This way. Come on! Come on! Come on! Let's go! Go, go, go! - What the hell? - What's happening? Dad. This way. Stop! Stop! Dad! - Guys, come on, come on! Guys! - Kit! Come on! Come on! Get out! I'll be right behind you. Go! - There's no time for that. - We must save what we can. Simone, listen to me. It's over. Listen. Aah! I'm in control! I am in control! No, this way! This way! I see him! He's going in there! Anton! Anton! Anton! Go. He's there. - Where is he? Where is he? - Kit, come on! What are you doing? Veronica, get out! They're still inside! They're still inside! Stop the car, Dave. Stop the car! Jules, look at me. We've got to go. We have to get out of here. Watch out! Jules, no! Dad? Kit, darling, you need to get up. I'm so tired, Dad. I know. It's just too hard. It is. But you have to try. You started it, and you finished it. If you trust me, and if you give all this a chance, if you try... Honey! Honey! Watch her head. You're meant to do great things, Kathryn. You started on a meaningful path. It's up to you whether you finish or not. - Are you a relative? - I'm her mother. Ginny! Ginny! - I'll follow you. - Okay. Oh, baby. Let's go! I'm lost, Dad. I know. We all are. I'm dying, aren't I? Yes. I've missed you so much, Dad. I've missed you too, Kit. I want to stay with you. You have so much life ahead. This is the beginning. You'll find a way. I have to go now. Will I ever see you again? I love you so much, Kit. I love you too, Dad. Goodbye. I got a pulse. I got a pulse, I got a pulse! What... Hello, baby. Oh, hey! I love you so much. It's okay. * Rambo Media Ltd *
