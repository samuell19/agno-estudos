There you can see all the work we did on the mill. It's beautiful light inside. But unfortunately, someone pulled our rocks off the bottom, and ruined it all. But you can see how big it was from that. That's my Indian 750 cc motorcycle. But it was a great old bike. Biggest rhino I ever saw. Taken from underneath. This is Hog Ranch. That's inside a tent. - Can you get it? - Yeah. Here's Truman and Terry Southern and Andy during the Rolling Stones tour. It was the best. It was like... Everything was like 54. I kinda like that one of Mick. Waterskiing in Montauk. There's Bianca. He couldn't swim, but we had amazing waterskiing. That's Bianca. This is going to Madison Square Garden. From Montauk. Very nice. I kinda like this one. Jackie. That's on Skorpios. 1972 or something. She wanted to have a photo lesson. So she got it. This is Andy in the back of Eothen. It's got all kinds of things in. Little collage. Karen Blixen. - Does it come across? - Yep. Carole Bouquet, the obscure object of visual desire. This is Montauk. That's about 105 yards away from where we are right now. Donyale Luna. This is the last of the snows of Kilimanjaro. Kilima...Mountain. Jaro...caravans. Slave caravans. This might be a good Francis Bacon section. Well, he was doing some portraits of me but... You can see me. Normally you don't know anyone that Bacon paints because he doesn't show anybody. We had lunch at the Ritz and... I would always enjoy talking with him, and I went up to his place. He never really liked to be photographed, so I was very lucky. The most interesting person you could imagine... Bacon. This is what my face looks like in the morning. Elephants looking for trees... On the way to heaven. This is with Truman Capote in San Quentin. We went there when he was doing interviews with the death row people. And then I went back a couple of times. He liked them very much. I can't remember the names. This is me with Karen Blixen. Very near her very last photo. June 1962. She died a month and a half after. Hang on for one sec. Jenny and her jewelry. I always liked that. Eva Herzigova. Giant polaroids. These are giant polaroids. Very nice. You can do double exposures. Iman. Diaries. This is a good Andy Warhol portrait. I like it. This is from inside Eothen. In the house. And... Andy in the country. That's the rare thing. 1972 or something... Okay, here we go... That's a group of starving elephants in Tsavo. You can see the population surging up there. - So that's it. - Cool. Oh, my God, that's Lee. We met at Skorpios. I was kinda like looking after the kids in a way, or you know, just... Jackie was doing an introduction to my book, "Longing for Darkness." So, I did a little Skorpios with trips into Athens. It was a great summer. When my sister asked me to come and recover after... a big operation... to Skorpios and have my own house there, and the children etcetera... It sounded like the ideal place to recuperate, and she already had asked Peter Beard, who she knew, to come and amuse her children with painting, with sculpting, with skiing... They just adored him. His enthusiasm really helped bring me back to life. She was always great, just exactly like that... That is Lee. And she was very, very, very open. Very easy to meet. And we did a lot of water skiing. We went to different islands. Skorpios is totally private, but we had the Christina there. It was a classic boat, I mean... God, it was so great. And Onassis and Jackie... We got on so well, we then went on this trip in Kenya, Lake Rudolf. And... Lee is the most perfect person. His mess was everywhere in the house... His collages, photographs... Just all over every floor. And he was always on his knees. Gluing or... Rubbing a pen into his arm to get blood to put on his paintings! It was just paradise because in those days, so few boats were around that you had at least a 100 beaches to yourself. When we got back to New York, he'd often sleep in his station wagon. He was super good-looking, and had a body of a Greek god... It was always the same color tan. And always an opinion, and... An extraordinary costume that only he could get away with. He just gave me so many more interests, and so much more curiosity about possibilities. And... Montauk was full of great people, mostly fishermen. Now, it's mostly tourists. I'm the last house on Long Island... So... I've got an advantage over the other people. It's very hard to get here. I was down in a place called Eothen, an early Montauk residence. And... I was up there with friends and we rented it for several years. And Andy used to come. Bianca. Most of the Factory used to come. I got this from his partner, Paul Morrissey, so Paul used to come out first and then Andy caught on to how great a place it was. And I think the only times he ever went into the country it was coming down to visit there. And we had just very low key, rather surprising diversity of people. Bianca stayed there for quite a while actually. Mick came and stayed there. And... I was doing movies with Jonas Mekas at that time, and Jonas was doing a film on my diaries. "Diaries, Notebooks and Sketches" Everybody was there. Believe me. And... I was doing the books on Africa. There was one book with Karen Blixen, all written by hand. I was busy. Yeah, I was extremely busy. Heavily into diaries and collage. And staying up all night... Very active in the nightlife. Everything was perfect in those days. That's the heart of Studio 54 also. This is just so far out... That's when the light went out... I wanna keep trying, yeah... Oh yeah. Oh, sh...! Andy Warhol was a living sculpture. Organic, unpredictable, interesting... Very good in conversation, very good in attitude and... very unique. My God! Look at that! First of all, photography is hugely open for everybody. But I mean it's obvious that only certain people rise above the boring point. Take some more time to do it... And photography... offers itself with a huge access for good luck. And also, you can do accidents. Ahh, Andy! Accidents are very important. Wow! Get ready for this, Francis Bacon. Whoa! Francis Bacon! This is just so far out! - Oh wow! - See? Looks like... Yeah. Wait till you see... Look at this one! That's the eye. See what I mean? - Oh my God! - That's nice... Oh yes... Ah! That's gotta be one of the great ones! I wonder... Mmm! Isn't that fabulous? Look at this! Look at this! Isn't that great? Can you...? You wanna...? - There it is... - It's almost a perfect match! Wow! Peter knew Andy very well. It was in Montauk, in Andy's house. And... Andy just bought it and never spent a night there. It was really roughing it, but it was in the sea and I adored that. I was really happy that summer. Me and Lee... We wanted to do an environmental film about the barometer of change of the famous Hamptons... The excesses and the excessive mismanagement by the East Hampton town officials. You know, just like everything else, East Hampton has become "Cash Hamptons." And... It's very sad. It's very sad. It basically started out from a newspaper clipping of the Beales' strange life in the Hamptons... And how they'd been there for years, having trouble from the town of East Hampton. It was my idea to go back to East Hampton, which I had so much nostalgia about as a child... And have my extremely eccentric aunts be the narrator for my memories. She had a wonderful singing voice and she'd say anything, her imagination was extraordinary. And her daughter, Edie, Little Edie we always called her, was almost as eccentric. So, I thought it would be a wonderful idea to go back there. Well, it took me weeks of drives from Montauk to their house in East Hampton at Grey Gardens, to get them to... open the door, and so that's how it started. They were pretty famous, Aunt Edie and Edie. They weren't out of there since, like the 1938 hurricane. How they stayed in there, I don't know. We were the first people to get to visit them. We were expecting them to be very elusive and un-visible. We didn't ever have any confidence that it was going to happen, the making of the film. And it took quite a while, but then Lee would shout through the door that the relatives were at the door. You can't get anybody to do anything nowadays unless you pay them tremendous prices. So the only thing to be in life is a plumber, or something else... or a carpenter, or a bricklayer, and then you will really make a lot of money. Where's Edie? Is she gone? Where's Edie? Oh Edie? Are you around? Oh Edie! Oh well, she never answers me. What are you gonna do about the music for this film? - The music? - Yeah. You told me you'd sing September Song, but either by yourself, or with me or... I'll try to, to get decent enough to do it. You did it one day with me, but you wouldn't do it last weekend. I haven't been well since these people came in here, Lee. You don't know what that hosing thing did to me. Put everything out of the house, I was destitute. I had an awful winter, you know. - Yeah... - Terrible winter. We had an awful time keeping things... going here, not dying, you know, with the electricity and the furnace... And lights, we just worked on every single day, and never moved from the place. And this man comes and puts everything out with that hose. It was a terrible thing that happened. Awful thing to happen. This place wasn't dirty enough for that. 'Cause we're very neat. Now, Edie is not much of a cleaner, she doesn't polish and do things like that, but she's terribly neat and she's not dirty. - Oh, I know. - Very dainty. So the place wasn't bad. We hadn't had anybody in here in five years, you know. Yeah. Not one human being going in that door in five years. How long has it been since you've been out of the house? - A year. - Yeah. This is the cellar. They said there were 300 bags of cat cans down there. They were coal bags filled with empty dog and cat food cans. That was the store room and I didn't have any other place to put them, so I put them down there. See, we couldn't get... We couldn't get the garbage collector that everybody had because he wouldn't come here. I mean, you know, he went to the very rich people. And he wouldn't come here because it was overgrown and everything. So I had to do all the... All that... You know. I'll do anything to help you, Lee. Just let me be in voice a little bit. You know? Okay, but you're always in voice. I... I feel very... - Grouchy... - I suppose... some songs are much more difficult than others? Well, sweetheart... I did lie in bed and keep up my singing, you know. I did all that flat on my back this winter... To remember the words and everything, you know. And I will sing for you. And if you want me to... ...try to get... I would like to take a bath. Oh, I haven't had a bath in about eight years! About a year, I think. God, I don't know what I'm going to do with that chair. She can't find the phone! It's in the pantry! It's inside something! Hello? Hello, Janet, how are you? This is the Big Edie Beale. Listen, I'm very excited. Yes... Some old East Hamptoners are here and they're asking me all these questions. You know Lee Radziwill? Of course... A real sister. Oh, yes! Jacqueline and Lee are real sisters. Well, she's my niece, you know. She's Jack Bouvier's daughter. And... No, not Bud, Jack... The oldest brother. My older brother. You know Jack? "Black Jack?" I knew you'd get it. No. She's writing this about old East Hampton. She's terribly anxious to meet you. And she's living in Montauk now. Yeah, she's beautiful and... Can you hear me? No, somebody cut us off. Hello? This chair came from Bloomingdale's. I bought it at a sale, it was $75 and I got it for $50, in 1949. I bought it in ten minutes. And the funny part is nobody sat in it, ever. Except me. So I call it "The Disappointed Chair." Pick your head up a little bit? That's great. If you keep your head up, you get better light. - A double chin. - No, no... Beautiful! There's Aunt Edie, when she was a little girl... With my father. She hasn't changed much... - You don't think so? - No. Look at her shoes with the bow. Oh, that looks nice! And then here is his mother... with him and with Aunt Edie, with Uncle Bud, because they were the three eldest. Wait till you see this really beautiful picture though. - I have the bigger one in my office. - Looks a bit like Papa. - Do you think so? - Yeah! That was in the first World War... World War One... But I love that picture, it's so beautiful... Blown up, but... That's... Young Edie Beale. How does anybody know? Edie, you were the most beautiful creature! She was, wasn't she? Have you fed the cats, Edie? You've got to feed them. I gave them chicken Friskies with milk. They were terribly hungry. I left it too late. - Give them some food! - I left it too late. I opened cans this morning before they came! Yeah, I didn't know that. You know what else I was trying to think about was... Who is still around that would be of interest to talk about Daddy to? - Your father? - Yeah. What about the Strong brothers? Teddy's alive. - Teddy's alive? - The Caffey's... They're in the liquor business. The Caffey's! They remember him very well. I can remember when there were half as many houses here, but... No, your father... I remember hunting and we met at the riding club, and we came out through this way, we came across some fields over and here... It looked kinda nice to see your dad and your mother riding together on the two matched horses, it was really pretty. Really pretty. And then you tell me that your mother used to have opera lessons with Aunt Edie, didn't you? Well, she didn't have lessons... What mother did, she was studying opera in Germany, she studied for four years. And she was going on stage. And... Then Daddy came along, and that disrupted all those plans. And they came here, and after they got settled, they knew... Mrs. Beale. Then they used to have, Mother and Mrs. Beale, used to have piano recitals and singing recitals... At old Mrs. DeKay's and at the Maidstone Club... - They got along just fine. - Just the two of them? Yeah. Did you ever go to them? Not any more than I had to. I wasn't quite geared for opera at that point. - But... - I never heard about that. - And unfortunately... - Oh, she had a beautiful voice. Mrs. Beale had a beautiful voice. Yeah, she's still got a good voice. She still's got a good voice. Well, that... The deal that the public has given them was a little rough. Yeah, tell me about that? How do you feel about that? Well, I feel that most anybody, any damn fool, can kick a person when they're down. Yeah... But it takes a good person to pick one up. And I think that they were too damn busy taking care of themselves, they should have gone and helped instead of condemned. It was very much of a shock to see the dark, moldy interior. I took a lot of pictures. We started off doing quite a few general interiors. Everything so strange and so wonderful. Officials tried everything. One time, the whole fire department crudely broke in, hosed the place down, starting with the first floor interior. Huge spray of water. And basically made them feel unwanted and unhappy. Listen, couldn't we just take the view from the porch upstairs? - Yes, I wish you would. - And let me see the vines? Sure! The vines have been pulled off, sweetie! That's what I wanted to see, I can't believe it. Yeah, Gospel Truth, I just cried. I don't wanna live in this East Hampton anymore, they pulled those vines off. They were English ivy! Do you not realize it took 60 years to grow those here? I know. Somebody didn't want me in East Hampton. Oh, but this isn't the roof man that did that? This is... - The people that... - No! - Oh, I see... - They came at night... when we were asleep. - Incredible... - I lost my powder box... Found it. Well... Can we go up and do that, Aunt Edie? Sure. Run up to Edie now, she'll tell you. - Yeah. - Ok. Just say, "I wanna see the porch view..." - You know that room was... - Wanna come up and take a picture... - ...with the view here? - You know... - Edie! - You know that room off the porch! ...get another portrait! Sorry, couldn't I... Could Al and Dave and I come up and take the view from the porch? Yeah, it's just in... Yes, of course! - Your mother says I can. - Yeah, you can! - I own the house, you can! - The room hasn't been cleaned yet. They cut down an awful lot, it was a jungle. Mother had hysterics. You know, the emotions of this place, I could just... Well, if I were a drinker I could... I could be consuming eight bottles every day or something! That really looks great in there, those cats... Which one is which? That's Bigelow, named for one of mother's... Mother was engaged to Horace Bigelow Allen, so I named that Maltese male cat... - Bigelow. - Yeah... I had my picture taken with him. - He's beautiful. - Biggles. Hello, Biggles! Hello, Biggles! Little Biggles. - Biggles? - And the two underneath? - Oh, Biggles! - What are their names? I wouldn't give up that cat. I don't know what I'm gonna do. - I'm mad about Maltese cats. - They're magnificent... Mad about them! Really amazing and there's a lot of... That's Tedsy Kennedy! - Which one? - He has eye trouble. We named him after Teddy Kennedy because he looked like him. - You think so? - Yes, very much. Don't you? - No... - Right there! With that profile. I thought he was the image of Teddy Kennedy, before he got fat. Oh yeah, yeah. - You'll see his face, he'll turn... - This... Hey, Tedsy! Hey, Tedsy! Oh, Tedsy! There he is. He's not feeling well at all. Why do you think that is? Oh, I've been very upset. But you think he feels that you're upset? Oh yeah! So close you know... - Cats, they're occult. - Yeah... - Much more than elephants or... - Yeah. What are the other things? Porpoises! They're much more than... Dolphins. Correct, dolphins... Dear Edie... She's just the best. It wasn't work! These people were so much fun to visit and so much... Every time it was different, it was always fun... "Let's go early, come on!" "Get there before 11 o'clock, for Godssake!" All these cats, they're never gonna come back! - Tedsy's okay... - They just never are! They were so happy with us, and then Lee got Ari to say, "Look, we've got to do something." And Ari just did the house up. It doesn't go with painting to have cats. Cats don't fit in to having a house redecorated... The painting and everything. I mean when you look into those dark hallways and see 20 garbage bags of cat shit being hauled out... And I mean, you know... - Can you get that, Al? - Yeah. It took Ari Onassis to get this thing painted. And Jackie obviously. Ari really did it. But Jackie was very helpful. They were all horrible, but I think everything that Lee and Jackie decide is all right... Do you know why? Except the hosing down, but I did yell at Jackie over the phone saying, "Don't you dare hose down our place!" - And how're things going? - Pretty good... I got the plumbing basically in for the upstairs bath. - Yeah. - Those fixtures are up there, right? But I got a problem, I gotta get an electrician here to hook up the hot water heater, and I gotta put a new boiler in. - You can't make them mad. - Yeah... I know it's a big problem because don't think they don't call me every day and... - I can believe it! - And tell me what's wrong. I wouldn't want your problems, believe me. Anyway, we've been here for the last five days working. You have? Now let me ask you this... Is the pipe across the kitchen? Ah, yeah... - Can you come in a minute? - Sure. - It'll take up a minute of your time. - Of course. Two. Of course. See, we're all on separate tracks. This was mother's picnic, then Lee brought her picnic. We're all on separate tracks, if you get what I mean. The cats are on their track. And... I guess you're on your track. Say yes! And Peter's on his... African photography. And the plumbers are on their road. That little thing's doing his number. Who's that? Oh, that's mother's little kitten, Champ Junior. The Beales have chosen to live a very private and reclusive life, this past score of years. You or I may choose to live very differently. I have yet to... been unable to identify anyone who did make a complaint. We're absolutely certain that none of the neighbors did. There's no problem of rodents. The Beales have a number of cats who have made it very certain that there would be no rats or mice running around. They have a lot of friendly raccoons in the neighborhood. But I think almost any of us would be pleased to have a family of raccoons that looked upon us as friends rather than torturers. The Beales intend to stay here, there's no talk of moving? There's no talk of moving. I think the threat of eviction is over. I hope the threat of pounding on their doors is over. And I hope that the large number of people who come by and stare and gaze at this property will now begin to respect the privacy that belongs to them. - Edie, I'd like to put the china... - I know what... ...in storage, you know, the good china in the dining room? Yes... - Don't you think it should go...? - It's in barrels... The barrels should go to a bank. - Yeah, but... exactly. - They're valuables. Exactly. And Mr. Olsen thinks we should store it as soon as possible. - Correct. - I'm very worried about it. Same as in that cabinet, Edie. You've got a cabinet full of crystal... Padlock it, somebody's gonna get into it. - So it should be put into safety. - Yeah. You see when Bill was here... What storage company is there in New York? - I mean in East Hampton? - You have Home Sweet Home for that. Home Sweet Home. And Mister, what do you think about out here, Mr. Olsen? See, I've been here since I was 17. I have certain feelings about every piece of furniture in the house. Ah! But I mean this. Edie says she wants to keep it but I say it's much cheaper to buy a new... Well, I won't have time, I was gonna strip it and paint it. I would say that it probably has quite a value to it. - You would? - It's all gold-edged, what I saw. I hope it's still in there, but I showed it to him, we just pushed the barrels back on the side. - I don't know what's in that cabinet... - Yeah... Things like this you have to leave... because it's going to upset them terribly if you take it. - Right... - I mean I know this... And the rattan furniture you have to leave but... This has to go, this upholstered furniture has got to go. Well, suppose all the good stuff that they want is taken, and put in the other room because you should seal this off. Right... - You're gonna have a heat problem. - I thought you wanted to keep... They don't need the room and they're not going to maintain it. But that's quite a nice big old table, so we must keep that. Right. I agree. - Just, old upholstered stuff... - This was built solidly over there. That was the last thing Bill dug out. You have a very good attorney, believe me, because he stayed the whole day, and he grabbed a shovel and he dug all that... And that surprised me, I never expected it of him. Isn't that fantastic? He was right there digging. I think... What's so fantastic. What was that? That Bill was so helpful. - Bill vanden Heuvel. - The lawyer. He was helpful, but where is he today? - Where is he today? - He isn't meant to help clean. Mr. Olsen, I think we knocked him out, Mr. vanden Heuvel. He's recovering at the New York Athletic Club. Probably. - Correct! - I wouldn't be surprised. Come on, let's go out and see your friends. Oh, Edie? Edie! This is mine. Do you know what the name of it is? There's a song called My Adobe Hacienda. And this is it. Do you know it? In my Adobe Hacienda, that is where I'll find my love. In my Adobe Hacienda, It's locked... It's locked, come on. In my Adobe Hacienda... How was that? My Adobe Hacienda. I don't know the words. So a Beale made the Bouvier movie. Why not? In my Adobe Hacienda... Where did all that Spanish blood come from? The Phelan family! They were half-Spanish. So, I'll talk to you Monday, okay? I'm glad you came, you cheered me up. Oh I'm so glad. You just stay cheered up, okay? The most wonderful visitation series I've ever enjoyed. Every single thing was... No bad side to it. Never. A great inner poetry. Bringing up new ideas. Talking to the cats. It was always amazing. You couldn't have made that up. No, they were in a dream world. And it was okay. How you doing? - Wanna step inside? - Good morning, good morning. - Is Ms. Beale around? - Gee, I think she's upstairs. Are you...? Tell her we're from the Health Department, come to see... - Can I get up here? - Yeah, sure. Bill vanden Heuvel is up here, isn't he? I think so. Mr. vanden Heuvel! Oh my God! - Bill! - Yeah? These inspectors... Bill vanden Heuvel! The town of East Hampton are horrible, horrible people, and... Mr. vanden Heuvel! The exact same treatment that Ian Schrager of Studio 54 also got. He was the best thing in New York, and those sons of bitches, the government, had to ruin it. And I would say the same thing about Aunt Edie and Edie. It's amazing the way people love to ruin things. Yeah, they were going in there with a hose... Hosed the goddamn house up! I mean you just can't believe what horrible people they are, and what liars. And lying of course, threatening to throw them out I mean you just... A surge of their own bullshit. You know, the little people who want to ruin it for other people. - You want Edie? - No... - She's right here, you want her? - That's okay. We'll see her when she's ready. Say, Edie! Oh, Edie? - Mr. Sallinger? - Correct! Could you come here a second? Mr. Sallinger, you wanna explain about the hot water? All right, we have hot and cold water hooked up. We have a hot water heater which I'd gladly take you down and show you, right? Okay. It's all hooked, piped and everything. We are waiting for an electrician to put the wires to it to give... It's an electric hot water heater, right? He has his service out on there, but he hasn't brought the service in. We can't hook it up to the existing service, right? It's too small. - But... - How much are you gonna do? - Seven rooms. - Seven rooms? The kitchen, the pantry, the living... The big room out here, right? - The dining room, the hall... - I'll give you a list, I have a list... - The hall... - Excuse me, I'll go get it. That's the new stove. This stove will go. What, this stove? Yeah, this is working, isn't it? Yeah. Got a match? Pilots working. It's all by Mack because that's the way we... - Bottled gas? - Sorry? Bottled gas or city gas? City gas. This will be closed off... You saw this before, right... We just want to... I've been in there so, I know. Everything is... I guess we could... Is this gonna be all disconnected in the unused rooms? I think he's just gonna wire... Basically what they're gonna use, right? I have to have this back, but if you want a copy, I'll gladly give it to you. You were here in October? I've been here a few times. I've been here right from the beginning... ...before all of us became involved. Oh, oh, I see. But the last time you visited the house, the inspection tour was in October? No, we were here a month ago. Little over a month ago. Oh, you were. - I didn't know that. - We were here in March. Yeah... Do you notice any difference? Obviously, isn't it? It is a big difference, I'm sure you notice it more and more as you go around. Yeah, put it at that door! And I said all the feeding dishes and absolutely everything! What are you looking for, Edie? - The thing I'm always looking for. - What, lipstick? Either my pants or my makeup. - Well don't wear your pants! - I haven't got the pants... Nobody wears pants nowadays! Why are you worried about that, with your cat just dead? Where is Mrs. Kalish? - Mom is the star... - Where is Mrs. Kalish, Edie? - She's right here. - I wanna speak to her. It's the only cool place. Let me speak to her. Bobby took the vines down. Wanna see how it looks? - And get those people! - What did you do? Ed! Go on, go on, get those people! Go on, get the boy. Get them all here. Photography's all timing. You know that. - Good photography... - All timing... You're taking pictures of a very old looking woman today. I was supposed to have this very tight, you know. Like that, see? And as far as the raccoons go, that's... And the raccoons won't destroy any more of the roof, will they? - You're sure? - Not with the asphalt... Not with the asphalt on. They won't touch it at all. They won't eat it, they won't destroy it anymore? 'Cause they're beautiful and... - They enjoy... - They're enjoying their movie! - We'll be up in one second. - That's a beautiful dress you're wearing. - How you doing? - I don't like any of this, sweetie. It's upset me intensely. Now I've gotten so I can't eat anything, can't even swallow a cup of coffee! But I think once you get settled, you'll feel a lot better. When am I gonna get settled, sweetie? They won't do any painting, it's the only thing I like... - Oh, they will. - There's my portrait, you saw it? Everybody that comes in, I make them look at that again! You showed it to me quite a while ago on one of our visits. Edie carries it all around the house. I don't think that's very good for it. We lost a 20-year-old cat today. There. Smell of that stuff killed him. - I'm gonna go join the others. - Goodbye, dear. Take care of yourself. I don't hate you as much as I did. I didn't think you hated me at all. Don't be presumptuous now! - No, I really wish you good luck. - Thank you. I hope you won't get too hot this summer. - I don't think so. - Unless you can get in that ocean. - I will, every chance I get. - Thank you for being so sweet. - Bye now. - Bye, dear. Does he want to sit down for just a second? Sure. I don't know what I'm gonna say to you. You've seen my portrait, haven't you? - Yes, ma'am. - Yeah... Is it worth a second look? That's gotta be hard... It's only worth about $50,000, that's all! - It's a beauty... - How are you feeling? - Today I feel fine. - Good, I'm very glad to hear that. But I do pretty well in hot weather. I don't care for the icy cold. Remember last winter? I had to put my hands under the cover to shake hands with you... - You remember what I suffered? - It should be different this winter. - It should be very comfortable. - You'll make me a hot-house flower, I see. Mr. Sandstrom is very pleased with what he's seen. - Very good, very good. - Didn't we have a hard time last year? I think you were slightly worried about me, weren't you? Very concerned. Did I ever give you a break? I don't think I did. I think my daughter did. Where's Edie? She's right here. I think Edie fell for you, pardon me. I think Edie did. - Edie has managed... - Ask him when he was born. Edie has really been the manager of the whole enterprise. All the work that's been done and it's really been terrific, it's really... Oh no, don't...! Don't give her any credit. I think everything is gonna be very nice though. When the weather cools off and we get in the ocean, I think it'll be gorgeous, don't you? I don't think I'm ever gonna get in the ocean again. - I'll be seeing you Mrs. B... - Yeah, when? - It will be a pleasure visit. - Oh, very cute... What kind of visit will it be? - Just a social call. - Social call. What do you want to drink? - Whatever you have. - Lemonade, I think. - Lemonade? - Very good. When he comes back, we'll make sure we have some. You let me know in plenty of time, please... - So I can get my makeup on? - I certainly will. You got your picture taken again! - Mother, you're the star! - Turn around! You're the star! - No, you are! - No, mother's the star! I can't find my makeup! I can't find my eyebrow pencil...! - I can't find my mascara! - Here's my lipstick. Put it on. - Where have I put everything? - You mustn't talk about it... - You're a natural. - I haven't found a thing! - Here, you want this? - No, that isn't what I want! - I want something to put on my eyes. - Eyebrow pencil? I left it over there, on the other side. At least I washed my face. - They don't care about those things. - Yeah but I feel... - ...a certain way about everything. - ...washing her face? Isn't that nutty? They both lost weight, the Board of Health people... Did you notice how much thinner they'd gotten? - Did you notice it? - It's not there, did you find it? Is that Hippy, Edie? Is that old Hippy? - Yes, this is Hipperino. - She's very old, she's 15, isn't she? - Yes. - She lost her ruff. - Yeah. - She had a lovely ruff, you know? And somebody pulled it out or... Think they really were surprised, Mother, by what the house looked like? Well, you know... Throwing away the springs and the mattresses... I think that's what surprised them... No, no, it was the way they cleaned out the back. Certain things... Is that what impressed them? I was wondering... Yeah, they cleaned out the back stairs. Don't you know it was that high with garbage? You know that. And then they put the roof over that so there could be no more... You know, rain coming down on the garbage, get that? So... Not the garbage, the melted boxes because we couldn't burn the cat papers. They were all put in boxes! It was all done for a certain reason, the chimneys didn't burn. The trees grew in the chimney so we had to stop burning. So then I put all the papers in boxes, and nobody would take the boxes to the dump. Why don't you stand alongside my picture? Right by my picture. Look at my face and then you know more. You know... I want Edie, back over this way a little more, towards the table. Turn towards my picture. Isn't that a beautiful mother? Put your arms down. Don't fold your arms like that, they look ugly. Put your arm and hands down! Show your beautiful hands. - You're not taking this portrait! - Okay... Hey! You're not taking the portrait, you're just taking Edie. - Who's directing this film anyway? - I want the two things together. I don't think I look well enough to be taken. - You look like a professional today. - I do? - Yeah... - Why? Well, the scarf is worth $100. I have to get a job and stop all this big talk. Edie? Edie! Please stop, for Godssakes! Don't you want to be photographed with your mother? Shall I stand up there by the portrait? No, he likes you better. This fall, I have to go get a job. What? Oh! This fall, suppose I don't land one... You can go down to the village, 'cause there's 100 waiting for you down there... Are you kidding? - I'm going to New York. - You're a celebrity now! Yeah, I'll bet you one billion dollars you'll never go to New York this fall. - Oh, I am. - What's the point? - You never will. - Certainly am. Oh, that's nutty. - That's insanity, Edie! - Well, I am. We'll see... We'll see if you get there. Every fall I said I was going to go, and I never did. Oh, they don't care about that nonsense! I see you don't wanna take the lady. - I was down there... - The lady in waiting. That's my pin you got in the back of that thing. What are they doing? I'm missing the whole thing. They're putting in a cesspool in the middle of the hall, that's what they're doing. I better go down there. Leave the door open, please, we need air! It's one thing, I don't want a house. So long as I live, I never want a house! Okay, okay... - We gotta hurry. - Yeah... Do you mind if I talk to Ms. Beale? Yeah! I look so awful. Don't talk to this man, okay? Please. - What's he gonna ask me? - How do we know? But uh... I really think it's a great mistake. Just say we want our privacy and... I never had any privacy in my whole life! I never even had a room of my own... - My own private time! - Just tell him... God, you see me. If I'd had a minute... - Yeah, we're going right now. - We're very late. - See it? - Careful... We'll be seeing you. Bye... - See you next week. - Okay. Bye, Aunt Edie! Bye! Bye, Bill! Goodbye, Bill! You old fool... I think it's very cruel to bring up the past. Awful. Dig up the past I think is about the most cruel thing anybody can do. 'Cause you always find some awful blot, you know? Or something that will embarrass someone. Oh, Edie! What I'd like to know is what dear vanden Heuvel told CBS? I didn't get that. What Mr. vanden Heuvel was giving out to CBS. Where is privacy today? - What you have is... - Where is it? ...an ornery cat... - Where's private property today? - Edie... Where's happiness today? Where's sacrifice? Where's devotion? Where is it today? What are you doing, up on the sofa...? - Where is it? Where is it? - Edie, I tell you, a cat... - Where is it? - You'll all be dead! Where is it? Oh, Lois darling, I wish you could come over. You might have a little fun. You don't want to come? Why, is it too far? Yeah... I wanna tell Lois something... Well, why don't you get in on the kill? Everybody's dying here. Edie wants to say hello. Here you are. I'm gonna tell Lois this. Hello Lois... I made visual contact today. I saw somebody in mother's room. Yeah, I have pierced the veil. Edie, please don't talk like that. - Edie, please! - I was not able to identify... I was not able to identify, I didn't see the whole body. Edie please, Lois will be very upset, please... Please don't do that. I was very excited about the whole thing 'cause I... I went downstairs and I looked for the workmen, and there were no workmen. - Correct! - They're all there, I can hear them. I don't know Lois, dear, I'm entering very, very dangerous territory. You better look pretty! Yeah... What about me? I made no identification, I saw no features and no face. - Here, will you take this to my cat? - Lois says it's a definite start. Take this to my cats, Edie, come on, they're starving. Of course you know I only hoped that it was one person. And naturally he would be in the guest room. Is Edie drunk today? - God, does she sound drunk. - You know who it is, I hope. You know, I'm absolutely miserable and my daughter is just elated. Happy woman. And I... I am on the out and out. Well, I remember your father, he was the most handsome man here in East Hampton. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well I tell you, there're a lot of stories really that... that can't go into print, really, that I know... You know I wouldn't do anything against my family... - I know... - To make them look... But I'm not gonna tell these stories because I'm afraid. Well, if they're too bad, maybe you're right. No, I don't think you should... They're just sort of risqué, but I don't... Well, tell the least risqué then! No, I just can't do it. I just can't do it, no, I'm sorry. Okay. I will say that your father was quite a ladies' man. - Yeah. - Yeah, you know that. - Yes, I do. - Yes, you do, all right. - So, we'll end it right there. - Okay. Didn't Mr. Bouvier live across the street from you for a while? Yes, your father rented... Oh, 2 or 3 summers... Your father rented the apartment up overhead, from Ed Baker, my cousin who lives there... ...where Amy is living today, my aunt. Well, your father rented that for 3 summers, and he had ladies... He was there all the time. Sometimes through the week, and sometimes only on weekends. But of course, he had a different lady friend every single week then... He wasn't feeling too good at that time... See, something got out now, I shouldn't have said that! I shouldn't have said that! Oh, Parlez-moi d'amour Redites-moi des choses tendres... I'll start all over again. Parlez-moi d'amour Redites-moi des choses tendres Votre beau discours Mon cœur n'est pas la de l'entendre Pour vous que toujours Vous répétiez ces mots suprêmes Je vous aime... You know, I ate a lot, you know. Oh, I want to hear those words that are so dear... I want to hear you say you love me By all the stars above me Your voice is like a fond caress... Shall I answer it? You thrill me till I must confess... Hello? I long to tell you... I'm broadcasting. What happiness... Is this you, Bob? Tender words of tenderness... Oh, parlez-moi d'amour Redites-moi des choses tendres Votre beau discours Mon cœur n'est pas la de l'entendre Pour vous que toujours Vous répétiez ces mots suprêmes Je vous aime... That's French enough for you, isn't it? Well, Edie's gone down... Edie's gone downstairs. We had a very... Hello, dear. Well we're not... We're a little weary now. You know, we had a lot of visitors here today. You know they were looking over the place to see... Yes dear... Well yeah, all over, everything and... Oh boy, we've been up since 5 o'clock, Edie and I. He wanted to meet Lee? I'll tell you why, her two children come down. From Switzerland, you know, they're coming by plane. And then she's gonna stay in New York a few days with the children. And then she's coming down here. No, she called it off. I see you people don't dose in coffee ice cream, do you? You know, this is the best thing I ever put in my mouth. I've lived a long time. - Want some? - Yeah. No thanks. Now, you're so afraid you might put on about three ounces, isn't that it? Right? You might be more charming if you put on three ounces. Just be natural. That's the most greatest beauty you're gonna have. ...Very good looking girl. Oh, the reporter? Yeah, the Newsday reporter. I guess she wants to meet you, Mother. - Very pretty girl. - Tell her I'm eating ice cream. She said, "How has this changed your lifestyle?" I said, "Well we've been brought up today, I guess." It's changed mine by making me completely miserable. "Mother liked the way she lived." My lawyer did too. He said, "I approve of..." She said, "Well, what would you call it?" "Thoreau and Jean-Jacques Rousseau." She didn't know what you're talking about. She might. Well... I was very happy... "My brother said we should just walk out." - I don't want any changes. - "And leave it behind but..." - But mother couldn't do that. - I was very happy! I thought I was doing correctly, I didn't know I was a misdemeanor, guilty of a misdemeanor, did you? They don't understand advanced disobedience. Do you think I was guilty of misdemeanor really? You were 50 years ahead, they don't understand that. Post bomb. - Post bomb is correct. - Post bomb. They don't understand her. Well... Anybody want some of my ice cream? Very advanced mind, I mean you're not gonna worry about running water. Well, I want water, come on now. As long as she gets hot water brought up in a pail. She's not gonna care whether it's running in a pipe. - It's no good if it cooks all day long. - Coming out of a certain... Like the electric ones, they cook all the minerals out of the water, and you get in the bathtub and what do you got? - Dead water! - Yeah, but that's something else. You can't get into that. That's too much. I don't think so, these guys... They just talk about cleanliness and are you sanitary and everything... - I am sanitary! - They didn't think so. Well, in an atmosphere of 30 degrees... Yeah, that was no... - 30 degrees... below zero! - There was nothing living in the house... There was no vermin living because we froze so in winter. How could any vermin...? The only vermin was you, Edie. - Come on... - Is that nice? - Do you think Mom is nice? - Yeah... - Is that nice, Mom? - Spice... You spice the conversation with interest. You spice the conversation. May I have a napkin babe, please? Now you see how... So that's what I am... You see how dirty and filthy I am? I'm screaming and yelling for a napkin. Just call me Louse Edith. LE... Louse Edith. That's very good ice cream. You like that? Terrific! Now undo the scarf and turn it around the back. Look what I did, I took that damn old pink thing off... And put on the blue... Your costume! You have to have changed your costume, at least every hour, every two hours. You're getting monotonous! I think it's very cute of Jackie to try to bring us up to date, now I'm not gonna say anything mean about the effort. Everybody sees thing differently. You can't dictate other people. I just always see it as a very beautiful and... state of being on a flying submarine. On a spaceship. It was just fantastic. We were pretty much selfishly exploring the amazing thing in front of us. Amazed to have the old world right in front of us and to capture it. Lee was extremely happy to go over into the past, and the two Edies were very happy to go forward. Little Edie graduated from Harvard. It was when her mother locked her up as her companion at Grey Gardens... And she never left East Hampton for 25 years. The Beales were terribly attracted by the cameras... Adored to have their picture taken. And they adored to scream at one another, constantly. I thought we could really make something extraordinary out of this... Without memory, there's no life. And... That's the way I'd feel, soon. She's running around. I don't think the talking seems to annoy them. Edie and I scream at each other every night... They don't... Mother, come quick! We're so accustomed to this, we don't think anything of it, you know. We see them every night, you know. So exciting for us to see them. - How many are there? - They're back and forth. - How many are there now? - There are two, wandering around. Only two? That's not interesting. And they’re having big fights over bread. You haven't got enough bread! I forgot it was Saturday yesterday... The little one they kept beating... I forgot to order for Sunday, that's all my fault, the whole thing. Little tiny ones... Here's some stuff I have for them. It's sunflower kernels... That made them very sick, they vomited that. Now don't be silly, they didn't get sick at all. - They did! - They did not! I am gonna give them! Anthony take some of these. Take a handful of these, they're really lovely. You've given those horrible things? They vomited those last night. They're very healthy, they eat this in the field. - It's hippie-food, throw it away! - No, not hippie-food. It was given to the raccoons, and I want them to have it. - Healthy? - They're very expensive, $2 a bag. Very expensive. They're supposed to be cooked, you know, in oil. Edie, please don't give the raccoons that awful sunflower mess. - Oh Edie, you're against all that. - They got so sick on that. - All that hippie theory... - No, they're not, Edie! Read about them. Here. Don't you wanna read about them? Nothing hippie about anything. You're supposed to take them with cocktails, it's what you're supposed to do. - I saw. - There's nothing hippie about them. Aunt Edie, there was definitely one here who keeps popping his head up and down. He's just playing. - Don't you wanna get some bread, Edie? - This one is very picky! Edie, don't you want to get some bread for them? I just put everything out, where have you been? - You haven't given them enough bread! - Oh, come on, I gave them... - They love bread! - 3/4 of this cake, Sara Lee cake. - We ran out of bread! - Sara Lee cake? For Godssake! - Orange Sara Lee cake. - Oh, now Edie, why? Why didn't you give it to children, for goodness sake! - I don't think it's very good cake.. - It's delicious! Why did you eat 3/4s of it then, if it was such rotten cake? 'Cause I'm always dying... - Oh come on Edie! Please! Please don't tell lies to these children! Please, I beg of you! Let's make it an honest day, shall we? Where everybody tells the truth? Imagine having raccoons in East Hampton. We have hundreds of them here, Lee. That's what happened to the house. - That's why the roof went. - The Board of Health wouldn't believe it! But we didn't care, we love the raccoons. The Board of Health wouldn't understand! - We fed them every night, Lee. - They're so beautiful. I think it was the icing on the cake that made them vomit. It wasn't a bit of cake that came up, it was all those awful seeds. No Edie, that's very good for them, the poor little things. They have terrible colds and... That's great to throw them, but then they started vomiting. It's very natural. Oh, there's a cat. This cat will scare them away, no? Edie, you shouldn't have Jerome there! Now that's very silly of you. The children came all the way from Montauk. - Jerome is messing up... - Why didn't you make the scene perfect? Why didn't you make this scene perfect? Is that Jerome, the cat? She's running around. It's my Black Watch costume. The tartan of the Black Watch. I don't know what that means. In Canada. You're not going to move back? Not today, not tonight, Geraldine. No, I didn't think tonight but... Sweetie, I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just know I'm waylaid here. With Edie sleeping there and Ms. Beale sleeping here. That's been going on for three months now, darling... Put me out of that room. Oh well, you had to. It had to be painted, it was a mess. - I'll tell you anything. - I hope so... He's the devil himself! - What? - Don't believe my daughter, ask me! - What I couldn't tell you about that guy. - Oh Edie, come on! I was madly in love with him, he's my uncle. Through him, I found out how perfectly horrible the male species is! Oh, Edie, please... Yeah! I found it all out from my uncle. You were in love with him, you shouldn't have... I was madly in love with him. You shouldn't have had incest with your uncle. I didn't have incest, I just found out about men. Well, you had to find out sometime, didn't you? Did you find the eyebrow pencil, Edie? Yeah. Every woman was madly... - Did you find it? - Yeah. I told you it was there. You going to believe your mother in the future? Women were madly in love with Jack Bouvier. And he was a mother's boy and he didn't like any woman except his mother. And he drove his wife crazy! Oh! Couldn't stand him. He was a mama's boy! Well, the first born, isn't the first born always? Aren't you sorry you didn't make up again? You had your second chance to make up, Edie. Could've done your eyebrows and really look charming. It's all you need, a little makeup. I think someone should kill those people for bothering us. The whole place should be bombed. Suffolk County Board of Health. You wouldn't work, you wouldn't have... - Ruined my life... - Come in and telling you what to do. Oh, stop! I've been all through this case and the whole thing. It's all old hat. Did you find my lipstick? Did you? You find my lipstick, Edie? - Yeah. - You did? Well, I'll put some on, too. The whole thing is complete old hat! Awful part is they're gonna raid, raid and raid if we stay here. That's why you have to close and get out. 'Cause they're gonna keep doing it. I can't see any eyebrow pencil. Here's your comb, I don't see any eyebrow... Over there, babe. Over there, on the right. Where did Lee go? Hope they're not taking my picture, Edie, I haven't any... Putting on my Indian makeup now. I haven't any makeup at all! Put on the Indian makeup, I look worse than ever. - You haven't got much on, kid. - No, no powder! - Why? Do you want my powder? - Always filthy, dirty in your horrible house. - You have powder here, you want it? - You're disgusting. - No. - I've got everything, I got foundation... I'll never feel right in this place, ever. You should feel right every morning. Get up and make yourself beautiful, that's what I do. You never can tell who you're gonna meet. You might meet your husband, your new husband. Yeah... It's all I need, a new husband. Don't you want some of my powder, babe, it's right in that bag there. You see the bag? I brought that whole bag of makeup hoping you would smear it over your... Now I'll begin to sing. - Babe! - What do I sing? Oh, Edie! Edie! You are taking that picture? With no lipstick on? - Oh, my God! - You look fine. Aunt Edie, you look really beautiful, wait till you see this picture of you in front of your portrait. - She does... - I don't know. I like to look myself over before I have my picture taken. Oh, this Bouvier vanity, it just reminds me of my father. Just reminds me of my father exactly. He wouldn't go out unless he thought he was looking absolutely perfect. Yeah, sweetie, he was very fussy about himself, wasn't he? Oh Edie really looks fantastic under those cushions! - You're the best model! - Absolutely terrible. Be smiling and happy! You're living, aren't you? You're breathing. I haven't murdered you yet. I think you've done a pretty good job, Aunt Edie. Yeah, I think she's comparatively happy. Very funny... You crazy? I'm on my way to Australia. You didn't cover your face up? Oh Edie, please! I hear your raccoons are making a racket out there. It's a long long time from May to December But then the Autumn... The days grow short... The days grow short - From May... - When we reach... November... And the Autumn weather Turns the leaves to flame And I haven't got time For the waiting game And the days dwindle down To a precious few September! November! And these few precious days I'd spend with you These Golden days I'd spend with you Yeah, I think you know that very well now, Lee. Now the words, my words are all... Very nice. She's alto. I never thought of the Beales as unfortunate or sad or anything, except... Very excellent at... feeling what it was like to hold on to the past. They just had nothing but echoes of songs, and dreams of a family history long gone. This is Karen Blixen's house... where "Out of Africa" was written. I took the Queen Mary to... England... and went up to Copenhagen... And then I had this opportunity to... visit her. But those were the days when... it was so great to... Travel on the Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth. This business of airplanes is... very, very, very disappointing. Well... The diary is not really... the exact word, it's... It's more like... collage and... lists, ideas, quotes... Just to keep the pen going. Subtitling: Mistral Artist-New York
