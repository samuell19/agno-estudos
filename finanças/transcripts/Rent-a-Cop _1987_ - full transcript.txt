Except he, uh, wants the money back that you took out of the hotel room. The money's mine. Hey, dancer, dancer, I'm on your side. You know that. It's just that, uh... Well, hell, you can't move that stuff. It's marked. He can launder it, so you kill the girl, and he'll give you a dime on the dollar. It's 200k. What do you say? What the hell? Jesus Christ! No!

You know, you look sweet in glasses. I wear them when I want to see. Hey, these print-outs are pretty good. Tony. Tony, come here! Tony! This is the guy from room 334. It's the same crazy eyes. Are you sure? He's the killer, I'm positive, honestly. Adam booth, code name, dancer. Dancer? Did I mention I dance? Lots of times. Joined the force, six months later, killed two suspects. The problem was that he liked it. Try this out. Says that he-- [coughing] It means it's good, you know? What else happened? The shit hit the fan. He shot the guy and then read him his rights. They didn't care for that. Was he fired? You bet. And then about a year later, he popped up downtown. He was teaching dancing at some ballroom. Dancers are usually nice people. Give me a break. Well, they are! He snuffed out old ladies. They were customers. Why? Well, his name was on their insurance policy. Get it? That's despicable. Old ladies? Yeah. They sent a team to get him. Why didn't they arrest him? Four guys, he killed them all. Now, wait-- this is making me really angry, Tony! If those numbnuts who call themselves police officers had the balls to arrest him so he doesn't kill everybody, how could something like this happen? Huh? Come here, I want you to hear somebody. Oh, yeah? Ready? Yeah. Is this a new sting record? Hmm, better. [Plays record] Don't you have anybody who's alive? No. No, these guys are good. Well, I'll tell them. Listen, I have an announcement to make. Yeah? Della Roberts is about to take off her clothes, so will all prudish policemen please cover their eyes from this gross display of female flesh? Go over by the window and show everybody. What a good idea. I was kidding. Get out of there! Come on! No. Come and dance with me. [Crash] [Gunshots] What the hell happened there? Look at the window. Ma'am. Thanks. What do you say, churchy? Hi, guys. Lemar, just a suggestion. You might want to drive. Thanks a lot, Tony. What happened to your window? When you want a cop, you can never find one. These were in the wall. You might run them through the lab, being a police officer and all. I told you we should have been here. Shut up, pitts. [Air hissing] [Tires squeal] Oh, crap! Church. Church. What? Come on, you promised. This lady is the best friend I have in the whole world. All right. We won't push her. You're going to show some respect. You'll be nice. Ms. Conners will be with you momentarily. Thank you, Victor. Where are the girls? There are no girls here. What do the customers do, jump Victor? When I think you're shaping up, you turn into a schlemiel. Della. Beth. Hi, baby. How are you? Fine. Are you sure? Yes. Tony church, this is Beth conners. Hi. You disappeared for weeks. What's going on? Well, I'm in a little trouble. Really? Yeah. Well, you look fine. He must be the reason. Is he wild? No, but he's got potential. Well, he's decent-looking. That's a start. He could use help in the wardrobe department. What's his name? Church. Church, come on down. We'll have a drink. He looks like a beer man to me. Well, I certainly hope you're taking care of della. We have our moments. I'll bet. Where'd you meet? Blanford hotel. Beth, Tony saved me that night. You're a cop? You brought a cop here? I'm trying to keep her alive. Bullshit. Cops don't care about US. Some guy's trying to kill me. If he finds him, I live. What do you want? Here's a list of ex-cops. Tell me everything you know about them. Beth, please. It's for me. You're not asking for much, huh? Next. Roger the dodger. Roger latrele. A real friend. Huh. Next. Sam Watkins, sexual preference-- baby dolls and bathtubs. Maybe I'm a little out of touch. There's nothing on Adam booth? Nothing, darling. "Reference h. Alexander" keeps popping up. Is that haskel? That's right. He's a good client. He's also Chicago's biggest dope dealer. [Orchestra plays] That's Alexander in the red tie. You remember how to work this? Yeah. I push this if anybody goes upstairs. Uh-huh. Where can I hide this? I'd tell you, but you'd hit me. I'll think of something. Bye-bye. Please be careful. Mr. Alexander. Mr. Alexander. Oh, please, won't you finish this dance with me? I've got something to do upstairs. Yes, but it's my favorite song. Please. How can I say no? You look very familiar to me, but I can't place you. Well, you know, we have a mutual friend-- Beth. Beth? Beth always had good taste. Ow! Don't you remember me from last year? Honestly, I was here, and I loved it. I was in red, and my hair was different. You know, it was down to here. Somehow I never managed to jump up and down and make it look like dancing. But... [Beep beep beep] Shit. [Beeping] [Beeping stops] Mr. Alexander, Mr. Alexander, please. I wanted to tell you I'm having a great time. It's just a wonderful party. I'd like to come back. We'll discuss it with Beth. What the hell do you think you're doing here? Checking things out. Who the hell are you? Security. You were hired by Beth conners? Right. Then your job is downstairs, isn't it, watching her girls? My men watch this floor. Outside! Look after the outside! You work here? How about getting my car? I'm off duty. That's church! Hang on to him! Hang on to him! Go get him! Get him! Are you sure it was church? Yeah, I'm sure. It's all over. I've been had. I've been had by a woman I trusted. Get dancer. Ugh! Baby, you all right? Hey, give me some help here! What's the matter? What's the matter? Aah! Aah! Aah! Hi, honey! Get out of here. Why? Because i'm taking a bath. Here, one for the inner man, and one for the outer man. Watch it. Ooh! Woof! Where did you learn that? We used to rub them up and down our calves after rehearsal. Good idea. There. How's that? Hmm. Nice. Ahh! What are you looking at? Nothing. Thanks. I promise I won't do anything that doesn't feel wonderful, all right? Fine. In fact, if you get upset in the slightest bit, you just say stop, and I'll stop. Ok? Ahh! Can I ask you a question? No. I'll ask you anyway. How'd you know how to run a computer, and you were in all those musicals? Well, some of those musicals. How come...How come? Sometimes you have to go through a hell of a lot to find out what you're really good at. Yeah. Hey...my clients needed me... And I needed that. So, in a way, you know, we both got what we needed. Kind of. You know-- ahh! Oh, you bastard! Ha ha ha! Ohh! What's the matter? Are you all right? I don't know. Why did you do that? Do what? I just tried to kiss you. I'm not used to caring. Neither am I. [Telephone rings] [Ring] [Ring] Hello. It's me, Roger. I got to see you right away, ok? What's happening, Roger? I'll tell you when I see you. Church, please! Where are you? At the moosehead. Come alone, ok? It's life and death, really. I'm on my way. What? It's Roger. I got to go. You still got the gun? Yeah. It's in my purse. What are you doing? Come on. [Horn honks] Happy new year, rog. Should old acquaintance be forgot. Yeah. I hear they whacked you around a little. I figured you would. Why don't we stop screwing around? You work for Alexander? The force was all I knew. I was kicked off for the same thing half the guys are doing. Right. I was drowning out there. Alexander threw me a life line. You said a matter of life and death. Whose, yours? Yours. I've done some shitty things in my time, but this... You're my friend. How can I kill you? Alexander's orders. You and the girl both. They'll kill me if I don't. What the hell am I going to do? I guess you better go ahead and shoot me. No. No. Whew! Here's an update on the stabbing murder that took place today. Though it happened in front of many witnesses, the police have no description of the killer. The victim has been identified as Beth conners. They are asking anyone who was in the vicinity of the killing to come forward with any information that might help in the search. Alexander figures it's one of our guys who leaked it to the cops. He tells dancer to hit them all. Not just the cops, our guys, too. Everybody. Tell me about dancer. He's a maniac. Hey, he was supposed to leave the money because it was marked. So what does he do? He keeps the money and everything. Nice friends you got. I didn't know about dancer. I swear it, church. Some of those guys were my friends. They were my friends, too. I'm supposed to kill you, right? Jesus, god almighty, how did I get myself here, huh? A smart guy like me? Church, I don't know. Victor! Ooh! You scared me half-- have the police been here? No. Give it to me. It's Beth's. Oh, Victor, for Christ's sake! Where are the keys? You have no right-- give me the goddamn keys! Come on! I won't need them anymore, anyway. Just horrible what happened! Just horrible! Yeah, I can see you're all broken up about it, Victor. Creep! He's got a whole army of ex-cops from all over the place. Why ex-cops? Because Alexander thinks we'll always be one step ahead of the working cops. Can you identify him? I recruited him, didn't I? You recruited him, but will you testify? Church. You want to come out of this alive-- only one way. You have to talk to the d.A., make a deal with him. If they keep me alive, sure, I'll testify. What am I going to do? I got no choice, right? That-a-boy! Tony, phone call for you. You're halfway home, pal. Yeah? Church, it's me. Beth's dead. I'm sorry, kid. It was the son of a bitch with the knife. I'm at Beth's. What are you doing there? My name is on one of those computer disks. I told you not to leave the apartment. Remember, we ran Adam booth through the computer? We couldn't find anything. Well, I remembered that his name is dancer. Well, I ran that through the computer, and bingo. Oh, hey, uh, let me get another. Hello, Roger. I can find him. The golden gargoyle club. Get out of there. Get out of there now! [Screams] That's Roger! We've got to do this. How many of your friends has he killed? It's the only way. If lemar doesn't get the wire, we're dead in the water. He'll get the wire. I'm just a lookout, right? I don't like it! He may not be there! If he is, I tell you, you come in. I don't want you hurt. Me, either. I really don't want to get killed. If he finds me, that's going to happen. Can't you do what I say without arguing? No. You got to let me do this, church. Ok. What? Ok. Really? Come on! Gee, what changed your mind? How do I know? Get back. Don't get near the car. You got it? You got it? Yeah, I got it. Here it is. That receiver cost $484. I got to get it back. You'll get it back. Who you wiring? Me. They can't hear you through the coat. You're kidding! Take it off. You take it off! Wait a minute. You going to tell me why? No. I didn't think so. You need back-up? If he spots a cop, he'll be gone. You warm enough? Yeah. Good luck, churchy. Ma'am? Thanks. Ma'am? Thanks for the wire. Thank pitts. I made him sign for it. I don't like this. It will be fine. Ok, bye. Wait a minute. The gun. In the purse. All right. Bye. Wait a minute. Maybe I should go alone. If he sees you first, he's out of there. You got to remember two things. I stay away from him, and I keep talking. That shouldn't be a problem for you. Yeah. Ok, bye. Yeah.

Ohh! Ohh! No! No! Ohh! Ahh! Dancer? I didn't know they were going to try to kill you. Aah! Oh! Uh! Uh! Alive, I'm worth a lot to you. Dead, I'm not worth anything. Think about it. [Crash] There. I'm unarmed. Dancer. I can't hurt you. I can help you. I can. Uh! Oh! [Footsteps] [Bottles falling] [Gunshots] Stay here! I'm going around back. Don't be a hero, pitts.

You're a good cop, Andrew. Thanks. Thanks a lot, Tony. Thanks. Ahh! I got to go downtown. I told lemar I'd make a statement. No, you don't. Yes, I do. Lemar said you didn't have to be there until this afternoon. I want to do it now. Can't you do what I ask without arguing? No, I can't. Church! You're a mess. Your apartment is a mess. Your life is a mess. You know how to straighten it out, huh? Yeah, I do. So... Jump. How high? Thanks. I got to lie down. I have such a headache. Where are we going? Our place. Our place? You want to argue if it's our place? You're lucky to have a place to lie down. I got pictures to hang, too. Now I'll have your pictures on the wall. Probably from flower drum song. No. But I got a great shot of me in chorus line. I'm standing right there in front of the marquee. Ha ha ha! Kiss me. You got it.
