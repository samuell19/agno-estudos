[monitor beeping] [sighs] [in English] THE CASE WITH YOUR FRIEND IS ALMOST UNIQUE, I MUST SAY. [speaking Italian] MISS, CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THIS SMALL DEMONSTRATION? THANKS. [in English] LET'S BEGIN WITH THE FACT THAT WE HAVE AN ENTRANCE WOUND FOR THE BULLET EXACTLY HERE. BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY EXIT WOUND ANYWHERE. (doctor) NO EXIT WOUND, NO BULLET INSIDE. NO. WE CAN ONLY SUPPOSE THAT THE BULLET ENTERS HERE AND THEN RICOCHETING UP AND DOWN THE SPINE, EXITS FROM THE SAME SPOT. GRAZIE. AS A RESULT OF THIS TRAUMA, HE IS NOW IN A STATE THAT WE CALL COMA VIGILE. ATTENTIVE COMA. UH, WHAT IS-- WHAT IS THAT? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, DOCTOR? AS YOU WOULD SAY IN AMERICA: "THE LIGHTS ARE ON BUT NOBODY'S HOME." UH, WELL, HIS EYES-- HIS EYES ARE MOVING. THE EYES ARE THE MIRROR OF THE SOUL. [door closing] THIS YOUNG ARTIST WHO HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM US AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE HAD A CONTRACT WITH MY LITTLE GROUP, MY TALENTED, WONDERFUL LITTLE GROUP. AND YOU MIGHT SAY, "HOW DOES THAT FIT IN THE GREAT SCHEME OF THINGS?" AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU. MY DEAR FRIEND, ORSON WELLES, HAD HE DIED RIGHT AFTER CITIZEN KANE, WOULD HAVE BEEN THOUGHT OF AS EVEN A BIGGER GIANT THAN HE IS TODAY. BECAUSE DEATH MAKES US MARTYRS, MAKES US ICONS. YOU LOVED HIM VERY MUCH, DIDN'T YOU? [sobs] YES, WELL... (flamenco manager) WHAT OBLIGATIONS, SACRED OBLIGATIONS THAT HE PASSED ON TO YOU, MUST BE HONORED? HIS CONTRACT, BY THE WAY, TO MY LITTLE GROUP HERE, MUST BE HONORED. NOW THE QUESTION IS, WHO HERE AMONG YOU IS GOING TO DIRECT THIS FILM? WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MARRIAGE? ME? I HEAR IT CONTAINS HEAVEN OR HELL. THERE'S NO THIRD PLACE IN IT. FIE, FIE, WHAT'S ALL THIS? A WHIPPING MARK. USE MY RING TO IT. THEY SAY IT IS A SOVEREIGN REMEDY. IT WAS MY WEDDING RING AND I DID VOW NEVER TO PART WITH IT BUT TO MY SECOND HUSBAND. YOU'VE PARTED WITH IT NOW. YES. TO HEAL YOUR WOUND. [panting] [grunts] DOES IT FIT? AMBITION, MADAM, IS A GREAT MAN'S MADNESS. I'M NOT SO STUPID AS NOT TO AIM WHERE YOUR FAVORS TEND. HOW OFTEN HAVE I SEEN CHILDREN EAT SWEETMEATS THUS AS IF FEARFUL TO DEVOUR IT ALL TOO SOON? BUT HE'S A FOOL, THAT BEING COLD, WOULD THRUST HIS HANDS IN THE FIRE TO WARM THEM. THERE. THE GROUND IS BROKEN. NOW YOU MAY DISCOVER WHAT A WEALTHY MINE, SOMETHING FAR MORE PRECIOUS THAN GOLD I MAKE YOU LORD OF. I MAY ALSO DISCOVER MY UNWORTHINESS. YOU DO TREMBLE. MAKE NOT YOUR HEART A DEAD PIECE OF FLESH THAT FEARS ME MORE THAN LOVES ME. [pants] THIS IS FLESH AND BLOOD NOT THE ALABASTER FIGURE THAT KNEELS AT MY HUSBAND'S TOMB. WHAT OF YOUR BROTHERS?

I'M NOT GONNA-- I'M NOT GONNA DEAL WITH THIS. HELLO. I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT TRENT. I AM DIRECTING THE FILM. THE POINT IS, HE'S IN A COMA IN THE HOSPITAL. [machine beeping] I WAS 7 WHEN MY FATHER DIED. I MEAN, WHEN MY FATHER LEFT US. ALL PHOTOGRAPHS OF HIM VANISHED FROM THE HOUSE BUT I CLEARLY REMEMBER HIM. THERE WERE 3 CHILDREN AND MY MOTHER HAD TO WORK HARD TO BRING US UP. I AM THE ELDEST. AND I WAS MY FATHER'S FAVORITE. HE LOVED ME MORE THAN THE OTHERS. CLEARLY HE DID NOT LOVE MY MOTHER. IT WAS ME THAT FOUND HER WHEN SHE HAD HER STROKE. I WAS 18, AND SHE WAS LYING ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR. IT WAS MIDNIGHT. I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN BY 11:00 BUT I HAD BEEN OUT WITH FRIENDS CELEBRATING THE END OF OUR EXAMS. I HAD COME TOP IN MY YEAR, ASSURED OF A PLACE AT THE UNIVERSITY. THE MANAGER OF THE HOTEL WHERE MY MOTHER WORKED AGREED TO MY TAKING HER PLACE AS A CHAMBERMAID. BUT AT A REDUCED WAGE BECAUSE OF MY YOUTH AND INEXPERIENCE. I LIKE THE HOTEL. IT SUITS ME FINE. THE WORK IS NOT HARD, AND I HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD TO THINK. THERE'S ONE MAID, LET'S CALL HER MARIE. SHE'S FAT AND UGLY, BUT HER BREASTS ARE LARGE. AND SHE'S WILLING TO PLAY A ROLE, AND THIS EXCITES SOME MEN. SHE BLUSHES, AND I THINK THIS ALSO EXCITES MEN. SHE'S NO THREAT TO THE MEN THAT TAKE HER AND THEY WATCH HER LEAVE WITH A SENSE OF PHILANTHROPY, OF HAVING DONE HER A FAVOR. I HAVE PERFECTED THE ART OF BEING INVISIBLE AS A WOMAN. I CAN WALK INTO A ROOM FULL OF MEN WITHOUT EXCITING THE SLIGHTEST INTEREST. NO MOLECULE IS MOVED BY ME. [whispering] I LEAVE NO TRACE BEHIND. [both panting] [both moaning] SORRY, MAN. SORRY, MAN. IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? (man) WHAT? IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? (hotel guest) WHERE ARE YOU TAKING HER? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? LEAVE ME! [screams] [grunts] IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? I--I--I CAN HEAR SCREAMING. YES, EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S ALL RIGHT. BUT I JUST SAW A WOMAN DRAGGED DOWN THE CORRIDOR THERE, AND I THOUGHT-- NO, NO. EVERYTHING'S FINE, MR. HAWK. HERE. BYE.

ALAS, YOUR SHEARS HAVE NOW UNTIMELY COME TO CLIP MY BIRD'S WINGS. WHAT SHOULD I SAY TO THY LECHER? THOU HAST ENJOYED MY SISTER? LET NOT THE SUN SHINE ON HIM TILL HE BE DEAD.

I PUT MY RIGHT LEG ON THE SIDE OF THE ARM OF THE CHAIR AND THEN DID THE SAME WITH THE OTHER LEG SO NOW I WAS OPEN TO HIM.
