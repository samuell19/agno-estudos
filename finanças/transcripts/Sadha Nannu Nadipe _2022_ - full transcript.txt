My name is Samaya Hasini. But everyone calls me Saha. Life has given me a loving mom and dad. It has also given me a deadly disease. It took away my parents when I was young because of thier constant worry for me. Ever since, I had only Shekhar uncle in my life. Shekhar uncle! What is all this? What are you building here? It's or people like you, dear. For many more. Uncle, where did my mom and dad go leaving me behind? They didn’t leave you behind. They actually left for you. For me? Hmm. Yes. Little Saha has a tiny heart. Her tiny heart has a small problem. Your mom and dad went to pray to god to help Saha get rid of that problem. Really? So, mom and dad won’t ever come back? They will come. You must take your medicine properly. Avoid unhealthy food, not go out but stay right here with me and always keep smiling. Then your mom and dad will come back. Okay? To fill me with laughter and hope, he has been trying since my childhood. When life is big, they say problems become small. Since my problem is big, my life has become short. That’s why loneliness has grown along with me. In spite of brightness, when you close your eyes darkness descends. But in my case, darkness remains my constant companion. Each time I think of myself, tears hug me with affection. After a few days, probably I became a burden even for my tears- they refuse to come in spite of crying so much. To comfort my tired soul, like a cool breeze before the rain, Life introduced him to me. A smile appeared on my lips. Joy stepped into my life. My loneliness has disappeared. It made me realize I have a bonding. That bonding formed in Vijayawada. Wherever MJ is, he should be before me in five minutes. -Come on! -Okay, sir. Hey, where is he? Where is the CI? What, sir? -Huh? Have you come for your collection? Or is it a casual visit? We came for MJ. Where does he stay? He is not so easy to catch, sir. You must call him with love. Only then you can catch him. Is he my son-in-law that I call him with love? No, sir. He is my nephew. A very nice boy. He is not so easily caught. We will see that. Hey, come on! How long should we run? What, sir? Did you catch him? But why is he so elusive? MJ is different, sir. He can be caught only when he wants. Not when you want. He is born with strange blood. He behaves quite strangely. But… MJ… what sort of name is that! -Sir! -Huh? Don’t criticize the name. Because I was the one who gave him that name. -What does MJ mean? -Michael Jackson. How can he be Michael Jackson? -Sir! -Huh? -What is your name? -Huh? Chiranjeevi. -Huh? -Oh! You can call yourself Chiranjeevi. What’s your problem if my nephew is called Michael Jackson? So be it. But tell us where we can get him. Over there…. on the hill. -Is it so? -Huh! Hey, let’s go. Hey, foodie! Go and warn him. -Hey, let’s go. Let’s go. -Okay. Let’s go. Rogues! -Get going! -We are! What happened? -We searched every single lane, sir. -So, you couldn’t find him? -NO, sir. What Mr CI? How come you are here early in the morning? Is it for MJ? Who are you, man? My name is Anant. His name is Chandu. His name is Nani. -Hey! -Ok, ok. Foodie Nani. Who is that MJ, man? Send for him! He knows you are here. He will be here any moment. He is getting ready. Fine. Shall I call him for your satisfaction? Wait. [Whistling] Bro! Some policemen are here for you, bro! Please come like a flash! He follows timing to the letter. Bro! I don’t mean an actual flash when I say flash. Give some time. Some time to see you. Some time for a visual. Go, go. Get back inside. Come in slow motion. There! -Listen, music director! -Huh? Start the RR. Are you MJ? Yes. Hey! Catch him. Where are they, sir? Hey, stop! Oh, no! Hey, wait! Hey, you … Hi, aunty. -Hi! Where to? -Hey! Stop, hey! Shall I join you too? Okay, no. Hey! Mongrel! -The police weren’t here for you! -Huh? -They came for Raju. -Is it? -Don’t panic and get caught. -Okay, Go, tell that crazy idiot. Go. Yes. Our guys are already senseless. I will go tell them. Aunty…aunty! -Ah? Keep two dosas ready when I get back. Also make coconut chutney. Hey, MJ! Wait! Hey, hey, MJ! The police are not after us. They are after Raju. He snatched a chain. And kicked the policemen in the flow. So, we don’t have to panic at all. Really? So they are not here for the gold we stole? Hey! They have no such information. You don’t have to leak it. -I thought of confessing in all this confusion. -Exactly. -You better give up such ideas. -Ok, bro. Ah? What, sir? What is it? I heard you came here for Raju? You are funny, sir. You could have told us earlier. We could have avoided all this. Look. Half an hour. Within half an hour, I will present Raju before you. What will I do for half an hour? Hey, come on, sir! I will introduce my ghetto. Come. “Hmm… come on, come on and take a look at my ghetto” “Hey! With narrow lanes, these streets are our paradise” “Wow, wow, wow, wow" "Wow, wow, wow, wow!” “Hmm… come on, come on and take a look at my ghetto” “Hey! With narrow lanes, these streets are our paradise” “Eat aunty’s dosas that put the five star hotels to shame” “Handkerchiefs from a shopping mall are no match for lungi and kurta” “With no money in the pocket, yet with a generous heart we are!” “Wow, wow, wow, wow" [Vocables] Raju is found. Come on. Coming. Let’s go. -Let go, man! -Move! Hey, MJ! We got Raju. Hey, Raju! I heard you beat up the police? And you are into stealing? -We do the same thing. -Stop it right there. Sir! This is the Raju you are looking for. Take him away. Hey, put him in the jeep. -Move! -Book him with all the possible cases. Put him behind the bars, sir. When he thinks of stealing again, he must piss… - he must drop dead. -You will know when we are caught. -I will break your jaw. -What is the next program, bro? -I just wanted to know. -Huh! Location shift. “Hey, I am a devious, crafty trickster I am cunning cutting master” “I won’t miss a chance to drop the bait” “He supersedes all grandpas and can pass a dime for a dollar” “He can auction even Tata and Birla” "A Robin Hood in riding I can tell right from wrong" "Come to me for help and I will lay my life" “A poor man when dead merges into soil” “A rich man has no option but to follow suit” “Help a little before you die” “A little kindness befits the heart” “Wow, wow, wow, yay, one two!” “Wow, wow, wow, wow” [Vocables] “Hey, intoxicated, the youngsters shake a leg” “The ghetto guys swing in excitement” “Rob the rich, feed the poor settle the account then and there” “Whatever he says, he puts it into action he will be the king of Amaravati” “Youth should have some fun they should see a world without slur” “They should be naughty with girls” “If someone hurts their modesty, see his end” “Wow, wow, wow, yay, one two!” “Wow, wow, wow, wow” [Vocables] [oil sizzling] Wow! What dances! What dances! Whatever you say, porcupine! No one can beat my nephew, MJ, in sporting a lungi or shaking a leg. Yes, yes, yes! -No one can stand up to his energy. -Yes! Give me one more dosa. Here. Take it. Did you notice how people were rearing to watch him? Yes, yes, yes. Give me some chutney! Foodie! You are always harping on chutney and dosa. Hey, Kanakam! What were you saying? Nothing, uncle. Aunty says the whole ghetto was swaying for MJ’s dance yesterday. Do you call this dance? Those days when I danced, even a fatso like your aunt would sway like a feather. That is my style! I broke my back! That’s how he swayed and fell. Hey! Tell MJ and dump him in the hospital. Put him in the hospital and then you will get your dosa. Otherwise, you will be branded. Hey, MJ! -Dance on top of that! -Ah! It hurts! Shut up! -It hurts! -Get lost! -It hurts! -Get lost! -What happened? -He fell down. He is hurt. -Who is hurt? -Me. Why would we bring him if someone else is hurt? He is hurt. One of you pay the bill. The other follow me. Bro! I will go pay the bill. You follow the girl. I will follow the girl. You pay the bill. That’s what I said! Hey, one of you come. -Take him. I will take care of this. -Okay! Hey, remove your hand. Sir, can you move? This seat is free. Err… I get the fan breeze here. Enjoy! Thank you, sir. He needs a fan! Say! Sir! -Malli, sir. -Yes, yes. Mallikarjun, sir. Mr Mallikarjun! When the nurse was going in, she was signaling you to come in. -Was she? -Yes. -Me? -Yes, you. -Why, sir? -I don’t know, sir. Did he believe it? -Are you confirmed? -Confirmed. No. Proceed. Yeah! I am fine. How do I open this door? Who? Who next? Excuse me. Who is Mallikarjun here? He just went into the room. Hhe wanted you to come into the room. -What for? -I don’t know. Don’t think too much. Just go. Okay. No. Hey! Hey! -Wait, man! -Can I get a quarter? I will break your jaw. You have already overdone your act. You want this on top of that. Madam, my brother… my uncle is not well. My friend is not responding. Can you give me your phone number? I will call you when I get a doubt. Please. Shall I give you my husband’s number? Sister! Someone is calling you. Husband number, my foot! Bro! Come here. This fellow! I missed the girl. Excuse me. There was a man here. Did you see him? -Mr Mallikarjun? -Yes. -He is … -My husband. Where is he? He just went into that room with two nurses. -For what? -Who knows? -He is dead meat. Loafer. -Go fast. I will teach him a lesson. How can she be so beautiful? It’s as if she is born for me. Ah? Of course, for me. This is confirmed. Hey, bro! This guy’s leg has a hole. Next time they asked us not to bring him here. -They asked us to bury him there. -Really? -What’s up with you? -Actually… it’s… er… Who are these people? What happened was… Ah! I have full clarity. What is it? One cell phone and two sim cards. Three sims. One Jio and two Airtel. -Hey, you are not listening to me. -Hey, I got it -Hey, I got it. I am clear now. -Actually…. Bro! How many such issues we have settled! You go ahead. I will take care. -It’s not that. I said leave. Leave. -Sure you won’t call me? -Get going. -Are you sure? Okay, fine. -How many have we seen in our place? -Let’s scoot, uncle. -Kids, come here. Tell me what happened. Come. Ah … Why are you wearing make-up? What? Darlings, I am here for you. What, master? How did I speak? I will tell you. Bro! Bloody hell Oh, my! It’s empty! I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy. I wouldn’t wish this on any drunkard. -Hey, Billa! -Huh? We are out of liquor. Mine was over in the wee hours. Oh tut! God is crazy. -Where can we get the drinks now? -How would I know? [sniffing] What happened to him? -Hey, Billa! -Huh? -Someone around here has opened a beer. -Huh? Is it? Where? -Red colour one! -Oh, my! Red one! Fourth lane. Third sub-lane. -Fifth floor. -Fifth floor? On the terrace. -He is opening the beer. -Stop him right there. Stop him right there. Stop him! The five elements don’t have the power to do it, Billa. Oh, no. Oh, no. -He is drinking it up. -Oh, no! Do something. -Stop him. -Let’s go! Hey, hey! Wait, I am coming. Hey, hey, hey! We are coming. Wait! Bro! Bro! Bro! I feel like counting the stars. Are you so drunk? -Hey, Billa! -Ranga! Our friends! It’s you! I thought you were some beggars. Why are you here? You were waiting for some company. We heard about it and so we are here. You are here to drink for free. Think what you like. What do we care? [both]: It’s the beer we want. -Cheers. -In that case, shut up and drink. But what are those injuries? It’s a big story. If he called it big, it must have been mince-meat. Why is Mr MJ looking up? Wait for while. You will see the fire in him. Bro! The moon is supposed to be in the sky. What was she doing in the hospital? Oh, my! The moon has gone to the hospital from the sky? How many times I told her? She gets drunk and falls on the road. She was even caught in drunk and drive the other day. I am not able to answer for her. Undisciplined girl! -Crap! -Hey! It’s not that. Hey, did you understand? -Yes. -What? When we got the 160 rupee bottles for 60 rupees I understood… -that this is cheap liquor. -Hey, I… I was not saying that. Hey! As soon as I saw the girl in the hospital, -I fell for her. -Ah? Ah. I fell. MJ! Is the girl that beautiful? Oh, my! Beautiful? What is he mean, bro? Her eyes… eyes… Eyes? Her smile… You tell. Come, bro. Her smile, bro! Does love feel like this? To speak about her complexion… to speak there will be no words…I Hey! Have you all passed out? Won’t you listen to me? You have no stamina even for a bottle. Where did I keep it? Saha! Shall we go? What are you searching for? Priya! I can’t find my diary. Where did you keep it? Right here. Where? Where did you actually keep it? Okay. You look for the diary. I’ll collect the reports from Rajiv. Where did i keep it? Rajiv! Saha’s reports… Oh! You have Saha’s diary! She is looking all over the room. Let me go tell her. Priya, one minute. I need to speak to you. To me? About what, Rajiv? About Saha and about her diary. About Saha? -Hmm. Do you know what is written in this diary? You know what’s written in this? Rajiv! Don’t freak me out and tell me what is in it. Let me read it out. Your friend is not happy. What we show is not love as per her. She calls it sympathy. So, there is no love in her life. She is waiting for love to happen. -What is this? -Rajiv! What kind of writing is this? -No, no, no. -May be it’s true, Rajiv. What? You think it’s true? What kind of foolishness is this? This is … Okay, fine. Forget it. Let’s keep love aside. Why did she write about her wedding? Did she write it that way? She did. That’s why I am asking you. Why did she write about her wedding? Can I join? Saha! You please stay out of this. What can she say about my feelings I mentioned in my diary, Rajiv? Okay. You will speak. I will listen. Okay! Tell me now. I will listen to you. Tell me. Everyone shares their feelings with the others. I have people around but I don’t have a heart to share. That’s why I wrote it in the diary. Anyway, to want something to happen is desire. To wish it happened is imagination. Mine is imagination, Rajiv. I didn’t want it to happen. I only wished it happened. If you think it’s wrong, there’s nothing I can do. You can do nothing? What? Can you do nothing? You can’t do anything? Rajiv! You are a doctor. Please keep your BP under control. How can I control it? She has a sickness that can kill her. Who would want her? Who would marry her? -Do you have any sense? -Rajiv! I am sorry. I am sorry. Saha, I didn’t mean to hurt you. I mean… Priya, at least you explain what my intention was. You were not wrong, Rajiv. None of it would happen in my life. -That’s why I called them fantasies. -Please, try to understand me. It’s okay, Rajiv. You just reminded me of my condition. Thanks for that. Priya! At least, you explain… Saha! Sharukh’s DDLJ is playing. Come. Let’s watch. Saha! Why are you so dull? You are still thinking about what Rajiv said? He was only concerned about you. Leave it. I am not in a good mood. Shall we go out? At this hour? If Rajiv comes to know he won’t tell you anything. He will blame me. I can’t. Seriously? Very seriously. I know. Other than home and hospital, I can’t go anywhere and be happy like others. If my parents were alive, it would be different. Who said? Who said you can’t go out? -Rajiv. -To hell with him. He is a doctor. Why does he impose rules like an army officer? What happens? What happens if we go out now? At the most he will scold you. And he will scold me with foul words. But before the kind of foul words we use, this will be nothing. Let’s go! Let’s enjoy to the fullest today. Priya, shall we take the car? Hmm... Your car… your wish. I will see who would stop you. Where are the keys? I will take care of the keys. There is beer in the fridge. Go get the bottles. Which idiot will stop you? I will see which idiot is going to stop you. This won’t work out. What about that? No. It won’t work out either. I have to think of something else. Hmm. Let’s think of something better. I have to. -Set, bro. -Huh? I have set up everything. We just have to start. That’s it. Actually… Will such a beautiful girl fall for folks like us? -Let’s talk. Let’s talk about it. -Tell me. You have a stupid face that shows nothing but a beard. She is a super delicate girl. How did you think she will fall for you, bro? How did you think? Two more words and I am going to break your jaw. Hey, hey! That was negative. -There is a positive one too. Come. -Tell me. Class X girls fall for their classmates. Intermediate girls for auto-rickshaw drivers… Degree girls for their Lecturers… And beautiful girls like this one fall for idiots like us. It’s common, bro. It’s a law of Nature. No one can change it. Are you calling me an idiot? Aren’t you? Does it have to be proved? -You want proof? -Hey, hey! -Beggar! Mr Beggar! -Tell me? What are you doing? Why do you wake up a sleeping man and ask him what he is doing? Idiot! So, you know my name! Do you know my friend’s? If he is roaming with you, he must be an idiot and a half. Okay? What do you mean okay? What did you say? You said beautiful girls fall for idiots. -Why is he calling me an idiot and a half? -More will fall for you. Oh, my! I missed the logic. Thank you, bro. You have saved me. Do something and help both of us. Understand? -Bro! Bah! -Huh? I thought I was one. -But you are… -What? He is right. Let’s go. Coming. Wait. Go, go… -I hope everything goes as planned. -Of course it will. -There is no change? -No. -You drive carefully, man! -I am looking at my girl behind. Hey, hey! Oh my! -My hand’s broken! -My god! Oh my! I haven’t, Priya! I have operated breaks appropriately. Actually, you know they were coming in the wrong direction… Shh… sit down. I didn’t hit them deliberately. It doesn’t matter. They have real injuries. Are they serious? You hit them with a big car. But their injuries are quite small. Come. Let’s inform Rajeev. Why tell Rajeev? He will scold you for taking out the car at night and me for opening the bottle. Is that necessary? Whom will you inform then? As if Rajeev is the only doctor here! We will find someone. Sir! Yes? -Sister, check the patient on bed number 15. -Okay, sir. What? What happened? Actually… That… Sir, you have to see a patient in Room No. 6. It’s a bit urgent, doctor. Please. Let's go! -Was it an accident? -Yes, sir. Were they coming in a wrong route? No. We were going in the wrong route. I can smell alcohol. Did you drink and drive? She drank and I drove. I knew drinking and driving will cause accidents. Only now I realize drunk persons next to you can also cause them. Sir, Room No. 6 You... Sir! Sir, patient’s details… Name Michael Jackson Everyone calls him MJ. His blood group is very rare. B Negative. -Hmm? -Yes, sir. Your blood group. He is my patient. Don’t worry. An injection will reduce the pain. Ointment will heal the wound. But for the illness God has given him, he will lose his life. -Confused? -Yes! Okay. Let me explain. He has brain tumor. He doesn’t know when he will die. Forget him. As a doctor, even I don’t know. He is very different. He smiles in pain. He shares his happiness. He doesn’t take anything seriously. Be it life or death. He is so strange that I remember all his details and not just his name and illness. You don’t have to worry at all. His injuries will heal within a week. I will discharge him tomorrow. You better reduce roaming at night. It’s good for your health. You reduce your drinking. It’s good for her health. Hmm? Hmm. He is in the same situation. But he is totally different. He doesn’t care about his death. He laughs. And he makes the others around him laugh. Who is he? He makes me curious. I feel fatigued. -If you drink like a fish, this is what happens. -You won’t come! We saw a girl and we drank in the depression. Why make a scene for that? -You keep saying something or the other. -Where are you going? -What is this? -Bill. How unjust! How horrible! Someone hit; someone admitted and you treated us. You did as you likes and why would we pay the bill and how? -Through cash. -Wow! Really? Cash! As if we don’t know! Do you know how many bus stations and railway stations we have to roam for this money? -What do you have you in your mind? -So, you are… He is trying to say we are recovery officers. That’s all. Not you. The girl who made an attempt to murder us? When we get her, I will show her. As if she has no one better to murder! Hey! Not her! -We must kill this one first. Bloody! -Hey! Actually I was the one who hit you with my car. What sort of driving was that? Who gave you the driving license? -Sorry. -It’s okay. No problem. What sorry? We were drunk but we were in the right direction. You came in the wrong route and rammed into us. Don’t tell me you were drunk? Were you drunk? I was not drunk. My friend was drunk. Shorty… -Then it’s okay. -Why are you dragging me into it? -You… I hope you don’t drink? -No, no. -Don’t drink. It’s not at all a good habit. -Bro! Why do you bother about all that? Are you girls? You drink gallons and run the vehicle into people! -He is like a solid tree and he fell down. -Don’t act samrt! You admitted us in the hospital. Fine. Who will pay the bill? Will you pay it or will l this shorty pay it? -Mistake is yours and we pay the bill! -Oh, no! Shorty! -I will pay the bill. -Hey, come on! It’s only a bill. I will pay it. I will take care. Bro! The bill is one lakh ten thousand. Oh! I mean… everyone makes mistakes. And then…er… not everyone gets the chance of rectifying the mistake. -What do you say? -Probably. I have no idea. So, I want to give you that chance. What do you say? Give it. Give it. -In case it’s difficult for you… -I will pay it. Bro! One lakh. It will backfire. Is it so? You have to pay. It will be nice if you pay. I will pay it. -Thank you, madam. See you. -Okay. Actually, your bike… Is it gone? Is it broken? Is it burnt? -It’s damaged. -Oh! Damaged! -Damaged? - It is such a cute vehicle. We raised it with so much love. Raised it? It’s my favorite bike. I love it. That’s why I put it that way. I will replace it. -Oh! You are super. -Oh! What a nice person you are and what brand she drinks, I just don’t get it. Don’t bother about him. Please replace it and we will go. Find out the brand. -See you. Thank you. -Thank you so much. -Let’s go. Let’s go. -Nice people. Gods. Sorry. Angels. Excuse me! Just once… Come back. Did you call me just now? I couldn’t recall your name. -Hello, sir! -Hmm. She didn’t know your name. Enough. Come back. We heard. Michael Jackson. Everyone calls me MJ. Okay. Saha. I need your number to inform you once the bike is ready. Note down. -Tell me. -Where will you note it? That way? -Hmm. 9849181524 Okay? Don’t randomly call people so sweetly. You don’t know what they go through. Don’t call. Don’t. I leave. Don’t call. Don’t simply call us like that. You don’t know what happens inside. We are boys. Just innocent boys. Aunty! Give me one dosa. You already ate 13. How many more will you eat? Excluding this one, make five more dosas. Okay? Damn! What is all this for? He is waiting for her call. -Will she make it? -He is sure she will do it. Hey! -Huh? If you keep looking at the phone, will you get a call or will she come out of it? Go and get to work. Aunty! -Aunty! -Hmm? Carry on with your dosas. You can’t speak a nice word. Well said! Isn’t it, bro? Shut up. She will call me. Hey! What are you doing? Are you going to call him? What do you want to do calling him? Do you know who he is? He is a thief. Do you know where he lives? In a ghetto. What is your range and what is his standing? Stop acting stupid and behave yourself. Priya! Really! Really…? There’s nothing as you think. Really? Yes. I just feel like he is something special. That’s all. You are saying something special? Tell me now. Tell me what it is. He knows he is dying. Yet, how is he so happy with absolutely no fear? Middle class is like that. They are very brave. Though he is a thief, he talked so well. Didn’t he? Thieves are like that. They become thieves out of necessity. Otherwise, they are better than us. How do we find out about him? No big deal. The ghetto is close by. If we go, we can find out. -Yes. So, shall I go? -Okay. Go. Who is stopping you? Thanks. Poor thing. Ah! Why did I send her? Bro! What, man? Turn around once. Hey! What for? As if the girl will come or she will call. Turn around once. What’s your problem? MJ! Huh? I need to speak to you. Personally. We have no such divisions. Tell us. Shall we go up and speak? Upstairs? On the terrace. Personally. -Let’s go up and see. -Come. Hey! I won’t come. You go ahead. Actually, this is the first time. I am not much used. I said personal. But this… this is personal. You wanted to speak. -Are you a thief? -No way! How can I be a thief? What are you saying? I am no thief. Damn it! Hey! Has he heard her properly? What is he saying? Tell me. -No, no. Stealing and all… -Tell me. Are you a thief? -Will you give it up? -Oh, no! Hey! He won’t. If I give up, what will happen to my folks? They have to buy vests and briefs. We also need money for expenses. Will you give it up for me? For you? If it is for you, I will give it up. Will you? Hey, don’t make such commitments. Should we sell balloons? Now, Priya will be happy. -You have my number, right? -Where? You took my number. No call or message till now. Do you know how hurt I am? I am sorry. I will message you right now. -Your bike keys. -Oh! Is it done? Okay. -I will leave now. -It’s okay. It’s okay.

Hey! Hey! -Hey, bull! What is in your hands? -Chips. -Not in this hand. In the other. -Bag. -What’s in the bag? -Clothes. Clothes…what for now? Actually… Saha invited MJ home tonight. That’s why this bag, clothes and the rest. She called him? Why? What for? As if you have no idea. Shut up. My nephew is not the kind. Oh! I have seen enough. -I am going. -Go on! Ah! Aunty! If you do so well at this age, in your youth how well… Bah! You… Hey, idiot! I am your aunt. Black rogue! We have reached. -Bro! -Huh? I don’t know why she called me. I don’t know the matter at all. Why do you think she called me? You are anyway going in. Why do you fret? Don’t panic. Go in. Don’t talk too much and eat her brains. -But don’t sit mum and act like a gentleman. -Okay. -Be yourself. -Okay. -If necessary, be like me. -Huh? I am asking you to be careful. Go. Hmm! -Bro! -Huh? -If you have a problem… -Huh? Don’t call me. Call someone else. Bye. Hey! Hey, hey! Betrayer! Hey! Get lost! I have seen enough world. I hope there is no one at home. Damn! Why do I think like a thief when I came to meet the girl? Why is it so dark? Don’t tell me they didn’t pay the power bill! No, no. It’s Saha. There won’t be such problem. Don’t always think on those lines. How can you think that way? What happened, MJ? You are lost in thoughts? Do I look good? How good? Okay. Let’s go. -Come. -That… -Sit. -That…er… You said you will tell me something? Food will go cold. -First have your dinner. -Okay. Actually, I had no idea what you like. So, I made them cook everything. Oh! Enough. Enough. You said you had something to tell me. You eat first. Then I will tell you. I mean… okay. I will eat. -You must tell me after dinner. -Okay. Okay. MJ! I don’t know how much you know about the Saha you know. But there is a lot you should know about me. I am not like the other girls. I don’t have a life like the others. I don’t have the time like the others. Yes. I am going to die in a few days. I know. You will be shocked. MJ! Other than medicines, doctors and people with sympathy, there is no one else in my life. I don’t know what happiness is. I can’t even smile. But you introduced me to happiness and laughter. Though you know you are going to die, how can you be so happy? That’s what drove me to know you. It made me think about you. It made me like you. Whenever I am with you, I feel so happy. I want this happiness to stay. I want you to be with me life-long. Oh! I called you for dinner and I am prattling something. I am sorry. I am sorry, sorry, sorry. Why am I doing this? Actually… MJ! MJ! MJ! MJ, let me drop you. Please! I thought sharing my grief will lessen it. But I never thought he will be hurt because of me. I made a mistake. I was acting selfish. Come on, man. Come. -Come on! -I am coming. Come fast. I have to show you something. -Come fast. -I am coming! What is this? Why are you so worked up? Isn’t this Saha’s car? Yes. -What is she doing here? -That’s what I don’t understand. Move! What, MJ? Are you hurt? You seem to be bleeding. Shall I give you ointment? Or will a band aid do? What is it? Tell me! Two minutes. Only two minutes. Saha! Saha! Get up! -Saha, get up! -MJ! Saha, first get out of the car. Saha, you are bleeding. Come out first. I will drive. Get out of the car. Listen to me. -MJ! -Come, come. -I will go. -Go ahead. Listen to me. Carry on. -MJ, please. -Careful. Careful. Hey, go with her. -What about you? -Go ahead. I will take care. -Careful. -Go on. Okay, okay. Don’t spare them. Don’t spare that guy at all. Take her carefully. Tell me now, Raju. What? You were talking about some bandage and ointment? When did you become a doctor? Just to hit you, why a doctor? I will become anything. Hey, MJ! I am eating, man. Hey, you! You are born only to eat. Eat! What, Yesubabu uncle? You always say work with a song and play. Why do you reduce the volume? Raise it. -It doesn’t work, son. -Is it? You set it right. I will set them right. What? I was saying I will bash you up. We’ll see who is going to bash whom. He won’t let me eat in peace. I quit. Sir! He is MJ. -Send him to my room. -Okay, sir! Sir! -Are you MJ? -Yes, sir. Come in. I need to talk to you. Tell me, sir. Who are you, man? Who the heck are you? What do you know about Saha? It’s not as simple as following her in love. Do you know what she is suffering from? Did you bother to ask? No. Have you heard of ejection fraction? Err… no sir! Ejection fraction! Pronounce it. Ejection fraction! -It’s er… er…. -You can’t. You can’t. It pumps blood to our body by 1 per cent per minute. Do you know what percentage is? It’s… percentage means… Ah, exactly right. Right, right. Exactly, my boy. The distribution you do after a theft? That is what percentage is. It means if it is 60 to 65 per cent, you can live. If it goes on reducing, you die. Saha was born with 50 to 55 percent. We don’t know when it might decrease. We don’t know what could happen. We don’t even know if she would survive. Sir, can we do some surgery and- -Ah… -Change it? Will you come do it? Let’s go. Hey! We can do that only when it is about to stop completely. He wants to do surgery! Look! Because of you, she didn’t take the medicine last night. She came driving for you last night and now she landed in the ICU. She is facing lots of problems. If you continue to be with her, we don’t know what could happen. You better stay away from her. I will make sure you stay away. I will see that you are out of her life. I will see… I’ll see to… Hey! Hey! -What did you do? -Wait. My friend is here. He will tell you everything. -Come, bro. -Move! Move! Move! I need to talk to you for five minutes. I don’t care what you think. That gentleman took me to his room and spoke this much about you. I couldn’t understand. I understood only one thing. You are going to die. I am going to die too. Both of us will be dead very soon. You asked me something last night. You remember? MJ! Actually… Exactly. Is that okay for you now? MJ! Come out! Ah! Are you here, sir! Great man! I was waiting for you, sir. You must listen to this. Listen. Saha and I are going to get married. What? Saha hasn’t said okay. Does she have to, sir? Her eyes say it all. That she is okay with it. What else do you want, sir? Enough. We will get married, sir. Tomorrow. -What, bro! -You go ahead. Let’s do it. How did my boy speak? You keep asking for MJ. He will come. Tomorrow. Just watch. “What has happened today?" “Is it love since you are close by?” “You played the mantra you worked the magic” “You are the one who filled me with joy I cannot carry” “It’s you…” “Shall I become you?” “Or will you become me?” “Shall I sing this love aloud?” “This yearning in me and the passion” “You are the reason for it all, do you know?” “What has happened today?” “Is it love since you are close by?” “I had a lot of dreams about you” “That in every dream you and I are together” “Wherever I am and whatever I do I keep thinking of you” “You have become a world stealing me away” “All these days, where was this love?” “May be I was born today” “Only for you” “Shall I become you?” “Or will you become me?” “Shall I sing this love aloud?” “This yearning in me and the passion” “You are the reason for it all, do you know?” “When I wake up from sleep all that I see is you” “I make sure you are with me for real” “I hold you in my eyes and spend my time” “If I don’t see you for a while, I break into tears” “I cannot say how much I love you” “There is no language even if I want to” “I love you more than myself” “You are my battle” “You are my intimacy” “You are my dawn” "My tight hugs won't you bear them?" "I am your spate of emotions" “What has happened today? "Is it love since you are close by?” Rajeev! You wanted to see me? Yes. Come, Dr Sharma. Come and sit down. How was the wedding? -Whose wedding? -Who else’s? Saha and MJ’s. I didn’t want to go and so I skipped. Didn’t you go? Also, he is your patient. Saha married MJ? Hmm. Yes. Why? Do you know his condition? What happened? You made a mistake, Rajeev. You should have stopped it. Hey! You have to prove yourself today! Don’t lose your confidence. Show your mettle. You must show what you are. Bro! -First night? -No. Lord Satyanarayana’s worship. Come. Let’s do it. No. Then? Why did you come instead of her? -I am the right person to come now. -Then let’s go. -Hey! Why are you in such a hurry? -What do you want me to do? You came in stead of her. My mood and enthusiasm have dropped and gone. The girl is gone too. -What? -She ran away. -Even before I could lift my dhoti? -Lift or drop… she has run away. How can she run away? I bought a basket full of jasmines for her. And kgs of sweets. Apples and pomegranates and she runs before I could even fold my dhoti! -Bloody hell! -Hey! Oye! Saha! Saha! Hey! Where is she going? How can she run away on the wedding day? How crude! -Tell me what you have done first. -Huh? She said she is deceived and can’t stay here. She went to the railway station crying. Tell me what you have done. I will break your jaw. Why do you say I am responsible? I was waiting with a lot of hopes in the first night room. She has vanished. And you blame me! Her biggest mistake was to marry you. You … What do we have to do with the shorty? Let’s go to the railway station. Come. I will tell you. -I am going to kill you. -Go aside and play. Where is she? Hey, Saha! You… Bro! Get up. You ... Oh dear! Don’t think too much. Nothing will happen. Why do you fret? She will come back. She will definitely come back. Like a film stopped on the first day, why did she leave on the wedding day? Did she actually love him? She did. Did she first propose to you? She did. -When you suggested wedding? -She smiled. -While leaving? -She cried. Huh? [both]: The girl has left and how come you don’t look sad? Ignore them. Hey! Don’t you find me sad? He is sad. He is wearing glasses. So you are not able to see. He told me lots of times. He is feeling sad. Did you trust him? Ah! -Where did Saha go? -Kodaikanal. How did you know that? By a little force on her companion. MJ Please, please. Let go. Tell me. Where did Saha go? Hey, nuts! How would I know where she has gone? -Tell me now. -Okay, okay. I will. -She went to Kodaikanal. -Why did she go there? Every year she stays for six months here and six months with her grandmother. What about my first night? Why do you ask me? Go ask her. Look! Don’t keep saying I did something. Thanks to her my flowers, fruits, sweets, everything has gone waste. I am finding it very difficult to manage. So, you are going to Kodaikanal. Which means we can do our own jobs now. I was getting there. As soon as I leave… MJ’s wife ran away. She left. She eloped. If you talk rubbish like this, I am now boarding this train. The same train will board you. -In that case, we will keep our mouths shut. -You better. -We won’t open them till you return. -Careful. -Bye. -Happy journey. KODAIKANAL Somehow we made it to Kodaikanal. If we find her, our job is done. If we have breakfast, one job is done. This guy! Bah! I am famished. -Hello, darling! -Huh? Come. I don’t know why my life sucks. -What is your name? -Huh? Oh! You speak Tamil. What is your name? -G…g…Gutti. -Huh? What are you saying? My name is Gutti. Hmm. Gutti? Suits your face. -Okay. What is on the menu? -Huh? Oh! You speak Tamil. -To eat? -Oh, to eat? I… Idli… D… Dosa. Oh! Corona! -Pu.. pu.. -What pu? …Puri! Thank god. Va…va… vada. -Did he say va or ma? -He said va. Why was his expression different? It sounded like that. But he said va. Hmm, okay. Two plates of vada. Two plates of idil with sambar. Lord, please bless me. God! You are praying for breakfast? It was a prayer. But not for breakfast. For Saha. When will you find Saha? When will you both get back together? When will we go back to Vijayawada? He kept saying ma. I wonder what he would bring. I don't know what's happening. We will find her. -Brother! -Yes? Green end park? -But it won’t happen. -Why won’t it happen? -You have to meet for it to happen. -We will meet. But she is leaving. -Where? -Over there. -She has left. She has left. -Hey, stop! She is gone. She is gone. I don’t know what you would do. In two minutes there should be a bike here and we should be behind her. One minute will do. -Whose bike is this? -What does it matter? We are thieves. We know that much. Get on. -Get on. -Move. Move quickly. We must catch hold of her under any circumstances. We must catch her. Hey, hey! That’s my bike! Hey! -Hey, hey! -Vada…vada…vada! Go on. Go on! She went that way. Move. Turn that side. This is the house, right? Am I correct? We have seen it. What else do you need? Of course. I must solve it somehow. Shall knock at the door? We have come this far. But will she allow us in? What are you saying? When she finds me she will fly at me with joy and happiness. Look. I have my own doubts. -This is for me. -Okay, okay. This is for her. This is for our… for that. You are obsessed. Why isn’t she opening the door? -MJ! MJ! Our MJ! -Saha… You! Crap! She called you crap. -Why did she close the door on my face? -I don’t know. Just watch me. Hold on. Don't over do it. Oh, my! Saha! Oh, no! I think they are over. Bro! I think the war is over. Let’s go. I am scared. Don’t be. Come on. What if she kills me? -Go on, man. I beg you. -I am scared. Go. She will come. -Go. -One minute. One minute. Just a minute. -I will go. -Go. I hate to look at your face. Hate? It’s over. Everything is ruined. You spoke exactly what I never wanted to hear. It’s over. Bah! -Bro, are you crying? -Can’t you see? -Go on. Cry. No problem. -Bloody! What did you do? You said love. What did I say? I said okay. What did you say then? Wedding. What did I say? I said okay. Then? Before my dhoti reached my knee, you vanished. My situation… no, I can’t say it. Okay, it’s the first night and the first time and I considered. -You know it was the first time for me too. -Get out. I considered and I came to the station and what did you do? You left the car at the station and your husband on the road. I still tolerated and came here and what did you do? You closed the door on my face and placed a fruit in my hand. -Hey! -I am still wet behind the ears. How could you cheat me like this? What did you say? -About love? -No. About our first night? -No. -Not that? Did I cheat you? That’s what I have been telling you, poker face! What is the name of your disease? Don’t be rude to your husband. What? Why are you coming on to me? -Tell me. -Why are you holding a knife? -Careful. You must be very careful with me. -Speak! -Hey! I… -Shall I tell you? -Tell me. You have no ailment at all. He has no brain tumor. I know he lives in a ghetto. He is a thief. He came to me that day, fell at my feet and begged me. I thought he was fearing a case and just to protect him I said he was sick. I never thought it would lead to something like this. -Hello! -MJ is not sick. He deceived you. You are the one who deceived me. How could you cheat me? Damn! -Bro! I am hungry, man. -Wait, man. Saha! What could I do? When you and the doctor spoke, I could understand only one thing. To make you love me I must make you pity me first. That’s why I created some disease. Nothing more than that. If I were rich, I wouldn’t be caught. I am not. That’s why I am caught. That's where I failed. Look. You shouldn’t tempt me in this situation. We will see to this later. How do you know about what Rajeev and I spoke? -Actually, I knew nothing. -I knew. He heard all that you spoke to the doctor. When the doctor and you were arguing about your disease, bro was outside. He heard it all. Since then he would think only about you. We had waited for you. That night we saw you drive and deliberately fell under your car. When you were in the hospital, we made sure Dr Sharma meets you first. I begged the doctor to tell you my friend had terminal illness. This was our plan. Such deception! Why does she call it deception? If we tell her about Auto Seenu and the ghetto what will she say? Are you done? I have bared it all. You have managed a wedge. -Okay. Carry on. -Okay! -Bro! I am very tired. -Hmm. I want to leave after a coffee or tea. -Get lost. -Sure? -Totally. -Okay. Come soon. Let’s drink. Bye! Saha! It’s not that. Hear me out. Saha! I did that only to make you love me. There was no other intention. Let’s forget everything. Let’s be happy from now. MJ! I count seconds. You look for happiness in every moment. We are very different. We are different MJ. Big difference. When I am with you I may want to live. Or you may want to help me live. Neither of them will happen. Please go away. Please. -No, Saha. What I am saying is… -MJ! Don’t do this to me. -Please go. -I will try to solve it. Please, please! Go. Please! See? We are back at where we started. That’s why I said let’s go after breakfast. You wouldn’t listen. Hmm? Vada… Vada… get a hot one. Fresh… fresh… get a fresh one. Go. This guy and his vada… Okay! Bro, she is not getting convinced. Women are such. They don’t think before they speak. They don’t consider what we say. We have clarity on that. But we have no clarity on our stay. -Brother! -Yes? -Do you have a pen? -Huh? Oh! You are a Tamilian. -[In Tamil] Do you have a pen? -Are you Telugu? Are you Telugu? -Vijayawada! Katravelli! -Gudiwada! -Why? Let’s stick to the tradition. -Corona! Who is he? He looks like Tamil Vijay’s cousin. He is in depression. I am Anant. He is MJ. MJ? It stands for Michael Jackson. -My name is ABCD. -Huh? -Let’s say Aditya Bal Chandar Das. -[both]: Oh! -Bro, I asked you for a pen. -One minute. I guess you forgot. How did you do it so smoothly? It is my professional knack. Carry on. The entire family…huh? This is a little personal. -Please don’t disturb. -Okay. -Master! -What? What are you doing? I am writing a love letter. -To whom? -To a girl. To a girl? You seem better off. -To my beautiful Saha- -Ah? With love, Balu. There can be a hundred Sahas in the town. Don’t panic. -I‘ll find out. -Do it. -Brother! -Huh? Does your Saha stay here? -Yes, she does. -Then, it’s okay. But she stays in Vijayawada for six months. Don’t panic. As soon as I saw you, I wanted to fall in love. Brother, may be you shouldn’t begin the letter with love. -Is it? -Huh! As soon as I saw you… I wanted to tie the knot in the morning and at night… Brother! Brother! Wrong, brother. It’s wrong. Don’t talk like that in front of kids. Brother, it’s wrong to write a love letter to someone’s wife. Very wrong. Trust me. Whose wife? Whom did she marry? Saha is my wife. Oh! Half of Kodaikanal thinks the same. Why should I drop? I am sorry. I am telling you the truth. -Really? -Hmm. In that case, tell me Saha’s address. Come out of the railway station, take a U-turn, -take the first left and then the first right -And you will find a junction. Go straight and you will find a huge tree. Saha’s house is right under the tree. -Oho! You are perfect. -Exactly. Right next to it…Is my house. Come home in the evening. We can talk a lot of nonsense like this. Hey! -Saha is your wife! -Yes. If I give you one punch… He is leaving. Bro, don’t get tensed. Bro, you are really great. He is writing your wife a love letter right in front of you and you could do nothing. Hats off to you. Already I am tensed about my wife leaving me. Some guy writes her a love letter. And you shoot me a satire! Let’s go. She drove us out of the house. What about our food now? Why are you dull? I made a mistake, man. I told her lies and made a big mistake. Hey, our elders said tell a thousand lies to make a wedding happen. We just told her one lie. We still have 999 left. You are anyway married. Be at peace. He simply worries. I am depressed my wife kicked me out and why does that guy want to write her a love letter? I won’t spare him. I am going to kill him. Why do you want to collide with an oldie? Your wife matters first. What were you eating at Vijayawada? -What? -My brains. You bloody! You ate salt and spices. Don’t you feel the passion? Are you not ashamed? Talk to your wife and sort it out. Show her Vijayawada’s heroism. Show her your brawn. -Show her what a husband is. -Okay. He has been honking for long. Let’s see what his problem is. Ah! Oh my! She left me on the roads and she is roaming around. -Let’s settle it now. -Do it. Come on. Get down. Get down! -What? -Where are you going? To the church. -Hmm. What? She said she is going to the church. Hats off to you, sir. -There is no point in supporting you. -Hey, hey! Listen to me. What then? Salt and spices! -Salt and spice… -Salt and spice….i will show her now. What? What do you think of yourself? You left your husband on the roads and you are roaming the market? You are living happily! Did you ever think whether your husband is dead or alive? No. What were you thinking? Wait. I came as far as Kodaikanal and you close the door on my face! -Bro! -What? -Two hundred. After that, did you think about me? Did you check how I was? Did you care? Did you do anything? Nothing. You just live as you like. -Auto! Purse! Purse! -What do you think of me? Where are you going? Damn the purse. Is that important or me? You don’t know my value at all. You don’t seem to understand me. No matter how much I love you, you just don’t seem to care. You bloody! Look at her how she is going away! “Oye! I am dying! Do you see? Breaking my heart, you walk away!” “Oye! Hey, you! Do you hear me? How can you hate me for a fault?” “I say sorry… why don’t you forgive me? I apologize… please extend your hand” “I implore you and yet you treat me like a devil” “I am going crazy. Why don’t you stop sulking?” “Oh, my! Oh, my! Oh, my!” “Hey, beauty, don’t make a long face shall I fall on my knees and beg you?” “Golden doll! Enough of sulking shall I treat you like a princess?” “Let my breath stop and let my heart stop but I can never stay away from you” “Though you hate me and scold me Though you belittle me this life is yours” “The more you reject, the more I love” “Though you move away, I follow you like your shadow” “I tell you my heart’s feelings in a song” “Oh, my! Oh, my! Oh, my!” “My love is as big as the sky think and take a stand” “Stop being stubborn and why don’t you come closer?” “Won’t you stop being angry? Why are you so adamant? Mellow a little, dear” “Won’t you listen to me?" "Won’t you stop being silent? Stop this fight now” “Demon, won’t you change and reduce my punishment?” “Won’t you hug me and share your breath?” “Won’t you turn me into a smile on your lips?” “Oh, my! Oh, my! Oh, my!” Bro! Go, man! Bro! Hey, get lost! -Do you understand? -Yes. What? You wake up and then disturb everyone around you. It’s not that. Women are women, man! Whatever I did, thought I drank, I am her husband right? So, she carried me and put me to bed. So, is this Saha’s house? My foot! Who is it? You were lying like mad dogs in the snow and I took pity and brought you home. [both]: Really? Why didn’t you tell us? We see a Jesus in you. Easy, man. I didn’t help you out of kindness. I have to be in the loop about your plans for Saha. That’s why I sheltered you at home. -Now I will know whatever you do. -You will know. -Huh? -You are lost in thoughts. Consider this your home. -Really? -Huh. -So, can we use the TV? -You can. -Oh, super. And the bed? -Use it. What about Sujana? Hey, stop smacking. I will break your jaw. Go out now. Go! Hey! She has already left. In my imagination, she is still there. Hey, you proved you are from a ghetto. Wipe that drool. Stop swinging. -Stop! -I stopped. -I am going out. If either of you comes out- -You will skin us alive. I will take care. I will take care of him as well. -You are smart. -Hey! -Sujana! -It will be broken. You can go ahead, sir. I will take care. Our ladies. Our Saha. He is supposed to be home. How is he here? I asked you to stay at home. Why are you here? Ladies who are supposed to be home, sit right in front writing diaries. What? What will we do at home, brother? That’s why we are here. If she lodges a police complaint, the police will come with a long baton! You already know, don’t you? But there is a difference here, brother. Girls sulking is beautiful. Boys begging them is fair. -Okay. There is a name for the one who interferes. What is it called? Some sis… Paralysis. Oh! Is it so? Out of pity I let you stay at my house. Now you are throwing satires at me? When I throw your bags on the road, you will know my value. Bah! Whatever it is… how beautiful my wife is, brother! Hey, I need some clarity. What was I talking about. What is he talking about? -Don’t send us out of the room, please! -Hey! Hey! What are you doing? Sit down first. Please sit. Your room is excellent, brother. It’s kickass, brother. Kickass? You… Baby beautiful! Come and see. I saw. Don’t you feel anything after watching them? I do. I feel they are doing what I can’t. Damn! You are shameless. And I came and told you! I must curse myself. I’ll handle it myself. Hey, what have you done? -It’s not that. He is the meddler and why is she curing me? -She expected you to meddle back. -The girl or him? -Him. -Are you sure? Hey! Have you no sense? Are you even human? No one who troubles a girl can ever be a person. I will call the police. Is today the new moon day? We got two girls instead of one! Bezawada blow! Hey! Who the hell are you? When you meddle with someone’s wife a husband without a filament may sit quiet. But when you meddle with someone whose husband has a generator inside, this is how the reaction will be. You don’t understand Telugu. I don’t understand Tamil. Let’s do one thing. Let’s fight. Let’s fight. Come on. I am already irritated something didn’t happen. Don’t delay and piss me more. He is so soft to look at. How come he is fighting like a rebel? Oh, my! I wasn’t aware and I gave a build-up. I hope he won’t thrash me when he comes back to the room. Oh! Where is he? Hey, hey, hey! Why did she leave? Bro! Actually…bro! Bro! It’s me. Sorry, sorry. Hey! Why did she leave like that? Unforgivable. Let’s drink over it. I took such a lot of risk for her. -Yes! Let’s go drink. She didn’t even thank me! -Let’s drink and sort it out, bro. -She has no respect for her husband. -Exactly. What shall we do? -Let’s drink and talk. -Come! Bloody hell! Pour, bro. Please, pour. -Where to? -You asked me to pour. I will spank you. I was talking about drink. I took such a great risk for her and hit ten people and she didn’t even thank me, bro. Pour, bro. Pour the drink. The drink should turn my heart into a pond and my tears should make a sea in this room. -Okay, bro. -Pour! Mix! Mix them both. Mix whatever you want. Hmm. So, partying? -Have it. Have it. -Brother! You are here! Brother, do you know what a terrible thing happened? I thrashed ten people for her sake. She left without even thanking me, brother. Ten people… literally ten people I hit… Hey, shut up! You keep harping about ten people. You hit only six people. Two of them were of no use. -I like your focus. -Ah! You want English now. Did you call the rowdies, brother? When you want to impress a girl… Hit four. That makes us a hero. But you hit those four and you became a hero. First of all it is wrong to eye someone’s wife. On top of that you arrange for rowdies and then plan a fight! -Did you slap me? -You have a doubt? That’s enough. I have the clarity now. I don’t have the satisfaction. Oh, my! Oh, my! Enough, brother. You seem tired from slapping me. Sit down. Relax. Hey! What is all the noise? Have you any sense? You don’t want your neighbours to stay? Please move aside, brother. You look nice. Where are your clothes? Where are your clothes? If you were a responsible wife, you would wear proper clothes. You are outrageous. You are brazen. You are outrageous. -Hey! -What do you mean hey? I fought ten people out there and you- -Brother, you hit only four. -Four? He hit ten of them. He thrashed them. I thrashed ten members and you walk away without even thanking me! Why would I thank you? They were coming on to me and you hit them. Is it so? You were being selfish there. He is a real human being. Though he knows you are rogues, he let you stay in his house. So sweet. Brother, I paid the rowdies. I have nothing to do with the girl. Excuse me! We both need to talk in private. You stay here. You come with me, master. -Go on, go on. Come on! -Oh, no! Oh, no! This wasn’t there earlier. Did you hit him? Idiot! How could you hit such a nice person? You don’t have even a little bit of common sense, do you? Huh? You don’t even think! You know I don’t even expect… That room is done. There is no one in this room. Let’s go there. Hey! Won’t you change? See what you have become? Why don’t you listen to me? You just don’t understand one thing I tell you. Stop it! You pull him up and he attacks me. Both of you are fine. I am squeezed in between. Brother! What is it, man? Don’t talk that way to my wife. I will be hurt. Was it too harsh? You better tone it down. Look dear. If you have even a slight respect for me, please leave from here. It’s not that. Balu! No, Balu… no nothing. Please, go! -Balu! -Please go, please go! -Hey! MJ! -Please go! I won’t spare you. Hey! -What to do? -Close it. Close the door. He even folded up his lungi. Darling, sweetheart! -That room was done with. -Yes. -This room is also done with. -Done. -There are no other rooms in this house. -No. -Only the wash room is left. -I am totally comfortable there. Bell is ringing. -Bathroom is calling. -Let’s go there. Not there. I wonder what happened to her. I don’t know where she has gone. If he comes to know… Good morning. -Hello! - I think I bashed him quite a bit last night. He looks bruised. -Master! Forget about last night. -Huh! Fix me hot coffee. Master! Why are you getting so tensed? I asked for coffee. Err… that … -Our Saha… -My wife. This guy! -She is missing. -Missing? -Joke! -It’s not a joke. There was a tussle with some rowdies the other day. I have a doubt if they have kidnapped her. -Doubt? -Doubt. -Doubt! -Doubt. So the doubt is if they kidnapped her. -No clarity? -No clarity. I will see you after I bring her back. You must stand by your word. -You must stand by your word. -Okay! Hey! -After I get her, I will tell you. -Okay, okay. How did I land with this guy! May I come in doctor? Hey, Saha! Come in. Come in. After a long time. I know. -How are you, uncle? -I am fine. How are you? How is Vijayawada? Is Rajeev taking care of you? He is taking real care, uncle. He is a typical guy. -He will definitely take care. -Yes, uncle. By the way... I heard something happened in Vijayawada. Some MJ… love and wedding… You didn’t want to tell me anything? But you discovered, uncle. I don’t want to talk about it. What happened was a nightmare. Okay, okay, okay. No crying, please. Please, cheer up. May I come in, sir? Come in. Sir. -Okay. -Okay, sir. What else, Saha? They are my reports, right? Tell me the result, doctor. It’s okay. Leave it. What are your future plans? What else, uncle? I must launch a start up in the US. I must develop it into big. I must live a hundred years as the richest person. Saha, I didn’t mean that. I understand, doctor. You asked me like anyone else. But remember, uncle. I am not a normal patient. What is in the reports? Saha! Your heart’s efficiency has fallen to 40 percent. You have to be more careful. I will arrange two nurses for you. They will look after you 24/7. What will come of that, uncle? At the most, I will live a few more years. But I won’t live happily. Saha! Don’t mistake me when I say this. God gave us only a little time. He wants you to be happy during the little time. They say when life is long, happiness goes short. Your life is short. Make your happiness long. Till now, you have pushed away the world around you. Step into the world once and see. You will know how much happiness there is around you. So, try to be happy, Saha. Thank you for your Phiosophy class, uncle. I’ll try to be happy. Bye. Oh! Have you heard? Did you understand? At least now, you go your way and I will go mind. It’s better. That’s better. What? What is that look? Oh, this? I drank. I came after drinking. You may be angry seeing me. But what I heard in the hospital got stuck here. That’s why I had to drink. I thought drink would lessen the pain. But it only added to it. I mean… If something happens to our pet dog, we are deeply disturbed. And you are a girl. ‘You don’t live. Your life is short. Go, die.’ You call him a doctor? He is a doctor and then he is your uncle! Uncle never said ‘go, die’. He said live at least now. Did he say that? Then he is a nice person. I am the loser here. He is a great man. If I say something about him, you get angry. Wait a minute. Tell me one thing. When a boy and a girl are honestly in love, it is called pure love. When a dying boy and a dying a girl fall in love, what do you call it? Insanity. Insanity! MJ! Life is very important. When you have it, you feel what life is this. When you don’t have it, you feel where is my life. You have a lot of life ahead. Lead your life happily. Don’t behave foolishly. What does foolish mean? Stupidity. Madness. Madness… Saha, shall I tell you something? There is a moon in the sky, right? It’s you. When it came into my hands, I didn’t know how happy I should be, Saha. When the same moon is going back there, I don’t know how bad I should feel. I laugh when you do. I fight when you are angry. I try to stop when you cry. Except this, I know nothing. I know nothing. The fact that you are going to die, somehow I am not able to take it, Saha. I am not able to bear it. I don’t know how to stop this. You keep saying life is short. I just understood that. You understood, right? Move away from me at least now. Live close to your own life. Forget everything like a nightmare. What did you say? I should forget it like a nightmare? This is not a nightmare, Saha. This is my dream. How was I at Vijayawada? Huh? I was coarse with a beard wearing lungis. You changed such a person into this. ‘This is wrong. This is how you should be. This is exactly how you should be.’ You said that and changed me. Do you want me to forget all that? Yes. The way you laugh at the little mischief I make… Do you want me to forget that too? Yes. Whenever something happens to me… it isn’t sympathy, Saha. It’s love. The way you show your love, -should I forget that as well? -Yes. Though you deeply love me, you pretend to hate me. Should I forget all this? I have no love. I don’t love anyone. So, you are not in love with me? No. -You don’t think about me? -No! Then it doesn’t matter to you whatever happens to me, right? If something happens to you, what do I care? I will see that. I will see that. MJ! MJ! -Are you crazy? -Don’t you come near me. Don’t come near me. What did you say? You said it doesn’t matter what happens to me, right? Don’t come. Don’t come. Hey, MJ! -If I die, everything will be fine, right? -Stop it, stop it! -The problem is because I am alive, right? -Please stop it! I don’t know, Saha. I want to die and yet I can’t. You want to live and yet you have no life. You live only for a short while, Saha. Why don’t you live with me then? I will take good care of you, Saha. Don’t push me away. I will really take care of you. Why do you keep me away, Saha? How long… “Always guiding me…” “Always guiding me you become the rain in my heart” “You move like a river across my soul” “You are in every night of my dream” “When will you come like my truth?” For the first time in life, I write the diary with happiness. I am how Shekhar uncle wants to see me. I have changed so much I can’t recognize myself. The reason is MJ. I must stop drinking every night. My head is splitting. Why am I here? Is that all? That’s all. Nothing else? What else is there? I think I came home without my knowledge last night. Sorry. Bye. I am not the type. Don’t mind. MJ! I hope nothing happened last night? Inside? “I didn’t know you would come” “All I say is not to leave” “Give me word that you will stay” “Never say you don’t want me” “Every day becomes your memory” “I am here only for you” “Every moment becomes your thought” “My heart is fluttering seeing you” “Have you banished me O love?” “I have been pining for you” “Have you forgiven me, O love?” “Don’t ever let of my hand, sweetheart” “Leaving you behind, within myself I carried a wound and died every day” “Giving you my heart, once again like me I have taken a new birth” “Oh, you are my world you own my everything” “Have you brought spring along?” “When you come closer, my body trembles with a new tune finally” “As you shower love, a rock like me begin to spread love …” “and become a sculpture” “Let me hug your heart” “And together I write you this life” “Have you banished me, O love? “I was pining for you all the while” “Have you forgiven me and come back, O love?” “Don’t let go of my hand, my sweetheart” “Always guiding me, it’s only you” “Always guiding me, it’s only you” “Always guiding me, it’s only you” “Always guiding me, it’s only you” “I didn’t think you would come” “All I say is not to leave me” “Every day becomes your memory” “I am here only for you” “Every moment becomes your thought” “My heart is fluttering seeing you” “You broke all shackles, O mynah! “Can the blue sky now stop you?” “Even if I had two hearts will they be able to carry this joy?” “We have become one in love this is a turn that is endless” Left, right. Left, right. By the way, what is Balu’s situation now? When he saw me and Saha like this, he must have lost his mind. -Has he become a fool? -Yes, very much. Not him. It’s you. You turned out to be the biggest fool. What do you mean? Look there. What, sir? Why are you packing you bag? Are you shifting home or leaving town? I had already told you. MJ and Saha are a married couple. You never paid attention. When we shook hands over a quarter, I told you coolly. You didn’t listen. What happened now? Have you got the clarity now? -Are you done? -Done. Hey, bloody fool! It was Saha who asked me to meet you. How does Saha… -Know this? -Huh. Rhea told us bloody fool. Marrying Saha on a lie, threatening Priya to find out where Saha is. Coming to Kodaikanal…I know everything. You danced around during the day and at night you were passed out in the cold. She couldn’t bear to see you like that and so she called me and requested me to take good care of you. She asked me to keep you in her outhouse. Though she appears angry, she is still in love with him. She knows how to take care of those she loves. Ask MJ to take proper care of her. -MJ… -Ask that guy… -That’s the story. -Saha had planned all this. -Really? How much she loves you! Whatever it is, Saha is this ghetto boy’s wife. I know. By the way, Where is Saha? She will come. She will come. She will come. She will come. Bro! Bro! -Where is Saha? -Where can she go? We searched the entire house. She is not there, where will she go? -Probably, she will go to the market, right? -Yes, yes. You sleep. Take rest. Don’t snap. Bro! I mean… if she has gone to the market, she should be home by now. No. She won’t. She will sell vegetables in the market. Crying out ‘Okra, Beans, Tomatoes!’ She will be home for your event. -That’s all you want, right? -No, no. Not that. -You sleep. -Balu over there and you here. You are killing me. You sleep. Sleep. Don’t scold me. Sleep. Bro! Is it about Saha? It’s quite late. She is not home yet. You won’t let me sleep, will you? Do one thing. Go look in the market. I will check at the hospital. Super. This is better. How caring you are about the girl. Did you ever show me an iota caring? -Not like that. Did you ever ask me where I had gone? -Not like that. -Did you ever ask if I ate? -Listen to me. -You won’t. Why would you? -Hey, it’s better you hear me out. Okay, tell me. Go straight, take left and then right, you will find the hospital. I am going. I am going. Careful. Hospital. Why do you look at me like that? Huh. Go. Let me go to the market. Hey! What are you doing here? Hey, where are you going? Hey! Hey! Where is Saha? Where is she? It’s me. Saha is in the hospital. -It’s me! She is in the hospital? -What? -Hospital? -Yes. I am coming. Why did you run seeing me? Why did you run? What do I care what happens with you? I lost my time because of you. -Greetings, sir. -Hmm. What, MJ? How are you? I am fine, sir. Why play hide and seek. Saha has two houses in Vijayawada, three cars, and one crore in the bank. She has a house here too. These are her assets. Why are you telling me all this, sir? Why do you say that? When Saha dies, you are supposed to take care of these. What are you trying to say, sir? Don’t pretend you don’t know. It is for her property that you trapped Saha, chased her and brought it to this point. Sir! My friend loves Saha not her property. If he is truly in love, he will make her live years instead of months. He won’t make her die in weeks. Sir, tell me directly whatever you want to say, sir. It’s the mad girl calling you. Oh, sorry, sorry. Mrs MJ. She must have called to say something. -Sir. -Go. Sir…Please tell me what happened, sir. Please, go sir. Please, go. MJ! I am pregnant. My real happiness in life has started only now. The crazy girl thinks real happiness has started only now in her life. Poor thing doesn’t know. Count down for her death has begun. Without your love and without your company, I would have died long ago. You are the reason for your happiness. We hoped Saha would live till some day but she is going to die quickly now. We will definitely have a boy. We will send him to a nice school. We will make him a great police officer. The girl wanted to be happy in her life. Now she has no life at all. But I have a doubt. Can I bring him out? Will I live till then? She loved and married. A great man. Death has advanced thanks to you. -MJ! -Huh? -What happened? -Nothing. Why are you crying? Nothing. He is becoming a father. He is not able to contain his happiness. Sorry, Saha. I am sorry, Saha. -I am really sorry. -Why sorry? I didn’t do it intentionally. I … sorry. Sorry. I am also happy. Nothing will happen to me. No. Nothing will happen to you. I won’t let anything happen to you. Nothing will happen to you. -I will take good care of you. Huh? -Okay! Let’s go. I will take good care. “O love!” “My love!” “My mind is so unstable” “My eyes have no sleep” “Oh, no!" “All the joy has flooded into tears drowning me” “Oh, no!" “The beauty in smiles turns into a sigh raging across the heart sparring it” “The world around doesn’t look the same” “How can I bear this?” “Following my foot steps the demon chases me” “How do I step aside?” You should tell me, right? -How can you come without telling me? -Sorry. -Saha! -Uncle! I just got the reports. Is the baby’s condition fine? Yeah, yeah. Baby is fine. But your condition… How is my condition? Tell her, sir. You told me over the phone that she is better than before. Tell her. Yeah, yeah. Your condition is also improving. Why were you standing so long? You are carrying. Go and sit there. -Uncle! -Go, dear. MJ! Don’t give her false hopes. But hope is the only thing that drives us. Let her walk too on hope. As long as she can and until her wish is fulfilled. Mistake. “There is no love without ache” “No pain can destroy love” “It never loses out of free will” “Without love, I don’t exist” “My heart! My heart!” “You are in deep distress” “If you are with me, all that you will have is tears” “The world around doesn’t look the same” “How can I bear this?” “Following my foot steps the demon chases me” “How do I step aside?” Have you got everything? My nephew is right there. “Though mind exists, there is no peace” “Though I have dreams, there is no tomorrow” “Though there is breath, it appears still” “Though there is God, there is no mercy” “Though there is life, it is filled with vacuum” “Though there is love, there seems to be no survival” “The world around doesn’t look the same” “How can I bear this?” “Following my footsteps the demon chases me” “How do I step aside?” Careful. Sit carefully. Yeah, yeah. I am comfortable here. Sit here. I will be right back. Aunty! Brother! We had a fight in the market the other day because of her. Brother, we shouldn’t spare her. What, girl! My name is PR. Oh! You speak Telugu, right? I know. I know very well. Like the sun is over our heads wherever we go, you seem to appear wherever my brother goes. He says you were normal last time. Where did you get this from all of a sudden? Brother, I guess her body guard didn’t use the guard. Is the body guard responsible for this or did one of our guys have a role to play? But these days we can’t trust women. So? Is this enough? -You want more? -Enough. It will do, brother. Careful. Careful. Bye baby! Bye! Do you know what happened in the park? What happened? ‘Where did you get this from all of a sudden?’ ‘Is the body guard responsible for this or did one of our guys have a role to play?’ Saha! It is out of innocence that we mistake a drizzle for a storm. When dogs shout, they call it barking. Don’t give them much thought. Is this you? You have changed a lot, MJ. We are human, Saha. Circumstances change us. We have lots of troubles and responsibilities ahead. Don’t think about anything. You have really changed, MJ. Go to sleep, Saha. I know. You haven’t changed a bit. Hey! First deal the card. Where are you going? Okay, okay. "To win his heart's love" "To show the valour of wrath" “Flexing muscles and baring heart milky fire reaching the sky” “Like a thunder bolt… like a storm” "Flooding them with your rage" “The sound of your footsteps like a cannon in their hearts” What happened? Who are you? Go on! Hey! Brother! Look! He is the one. Who is he? He is the same guy. Okay. But who is he? It's him, brother. Everyone is in trouble, brother! Sit! Sit! What did you say to her? What did you say? Say it now. Say it now. Sit down! Sit there. Sit down. Sit! I am asking you to sit. -Just sit. -Bro, leave us, bro. Bro, please don’t, bro. Feel good? You feel good now? -You shouldn’t say that. -I won’t say it, brother. -Never. -No. Sorry. What did you say? -What did you say? -Oh, no. Oh, no. Did you ask who her husband is? Did you ask her who husband is? What did you say? Wrong. It’s wrong. -It’s wrong. -Brother, no, brother. -Brother, please, don’t brother. -Very wrong. Saha! What happened? What happened to Saha? -She was having contractions at home. -Okay, okay. She had contractions all of a sudden. [Baby crying] MJ? MJ! -Doctor! -Sir! Sir, Saha? You have a son. But Saha is a bit critical. She has to undergo heart transplant immediately. Heart transplant so quickly? Sir, Dr Ravi calling from Chennai. Ravi! I need a B Negative heart immediately. We have to make a heart transplant immediately. It’s important. B Negative. Our MJ is like that, sir. He is born with a strange blood. He behaves as strangely. His blood group is very rare. B negative. But I have a doubt. Can I take him out? Nothing will happen to you. You will live. When something happens to those we love, we lay our lives to save them. We don’t kill them for our love. Please, Ravi. It’s very important. Sir! B Negative! Take care of them. Take care of them. MJ! “I never thought you would come” “All I say is don’t leave me” “Give me your word that you will stay” “Don’t ever say that you don’t want me” The moon in the sky? That’s you. When it landed in my hands, I didn’t know how happy I should be, Saha. When the moon is ready to go back, I don’t know how sad I should feel. “O love! O love!” “I leave my life behind” “How can you draw a line between me and you?” “How can you stay with you within you?” TRUE LOVE IS NOT SACRIFICE - IT’S ABOUT FINDING THE PERFECT REASON TO SACRIFICE ANYTHING FOR ANOTHER PERSON’S HAPPINESS IT’S CONSISTENT SELFLESSNESS “Always guiding me is you” “Always guiding me is you” “Always guiding me is you” “Always guiding me is you” “O love! O love!” “I leave my life behind” “How can you draw a line between me and you?" "How can you stay with you within you?" “Always guiding me is you” “Always guiding me is you”
