Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. I'm listening. It has been four weeks since my last confession. That's a long time. I don't know how to say this... I have feelings for another. It's not sin to have feelings for someone. I have had feelings for others before but not like this. These feelings... burn me from the inside. You have desires for someone? Yes, Father. Who is he? Not he, Father. She. You have feelings for another woman? I have feelings... for one of my Sisters. Tell me everything. I was busy with the chores when I saw her for the first time. Charlotte. Come see us in your room when you're finished. Of course, Mother Superior. Sister Charlotte This is Lily. She is going to be your new apprentice. Nice to meet you Lily. She's a bit shy. Her mother dropped her off here. She seems a bit lost, but I think with your help she will find the path that God has set for her I'll leave you to show her the rules and regulations of the Convent. Yes, I will. Thank you, Sister Charlotte. Sister Mona. You know... The first day can seem a bit scary. But it's not so bad. I don't wanna be here. Oh! No one is forcing you to be here. You can leave whenever you want. I cant. I'm sick. Only God can help me. Oh! Oh, don't be scared. Everything's OK now. I was looking for you everywhere. Are you feeling better today? You know I felt pretty lonely when I first arrived here too. But slowly I realized I wasn't alone. No, I'm not talking about God. I'm talking about my other Sisters. They're always there to cheer you up and to change your mind and... Being a nun isn't so bad after all. Is that...? Sacramental wine? Yes it is. Isn't that a sin? Yes. But I'll confess later. Body of Christ - Amen Body of Christ - Amen Body of Christ - Amen Body of Christ Amen Body of Christ - Amen Sister Darcy and Sister Penny were not in communion. That's very strange. Normally they would never miss communion. Yes, Sister Mona? Sister Penny and Sister Darcy are missing! I need you to go and find them and bring them to me at once! Yes, Sister Mona. Missing communion is unacceptable. Yes. Thank you, Sister Charlotte. Oh, so good Sister... Oh, wow... Holy moley! Oh, gosh. That feels good. It's been so long since I've seen your naked body.

I looked everywhere, I can't find Sister Darcy, nor Sister Penny. Go, go go! I haven't looked in the old chapel yet! I'll go look now. No! No, don't. I have to go that way anyway. Thank you, Sister Charlotte. We found them in the garden. They completely lost track of time. What should be the disciplinary actions? I let you be the judge of that, Sister Mona. But don't be too harsh. Sometimes compassion is better than discipline. I understand, Mother Superior. Can I ask you something? Ask me anything. Why are you here? You mean why did I devote my life to God? Yeah. Well it wasn't my first choice. I come from a big family. My two older sisters, and my brother were both married to good families. So my father decided to give his youngest to God. His way of thanking Him, I suppose. So, why did you stay? I had no choice. I was young I wasn't married I had no other option. I was like you at the beginning. Sad... But slowly I learned to fall in love with this place and my other Sisters. Honestly... I couldn't imagine living a life outside these walls. Dinnertime! Dear God, thank You for the food we are about to receive. Thank You for the joy, generosity, and kindness You put into our hearts. Thank You for this amazing family that you have surrounded me. When I came to this convent first, I was young, alone, and scared. Years have passed, and even amazing Sisters You put on my path to help me. You have given me more that I could ever hope for. This meal is a sign of Your love for us. Sister Dana, would you do the honors? Bless us, O Lord, for these Thy gifts, which we are about to receive through Thy bounty, through Christ, our Lord, Amen. Amen. The last couple of days, Sisters, have been full of temptations for everyone. I know it's difficult but we must be strong. The path to salvation is not an easy one. We all made sacrifices when we took the vale. We promised to renounce sex, alcohol and the pleasures of life available outside of these walls. But those pleasures pale in comparison to the incomparable love of our Father. I'm sorry, Mother Superior. I'm not feeling very well. Would you mind excusing me tonight? Of course. Sister Charlotte. Please follow after her, make sure she's OK. Yes of course, Mother Superior. Lily! Lily, please stop! I'm sorry, I... I'm sorry for yesterday. Forget it, it was nothing. It wasn't nothing. I kissed you and I shouldn't have. I'm sick. I really am sorry. What do you mean you're sick? You never asked me why I was here. I told you the first time I met you. Only God can save me. How are you sick? What happened? I don't enjoy men. I prefer the company of women. My family found this very hard to accept. I'm their only child. They expected me to get married, to raise a family. But instead they caught me in bed with another woman. I grew up under a catholic roof. My mother and father went to church every Sunday. Even if wasn't doing anything wrong they didn't think it was a way for me to live my life. So, my mother talked to Father Marcus and he convinced her to send me here. If there is a place for me to find the right path this is most probably it. At least, I hope it is. I don't know what to say. You have nothing to say. It is, what it is. Well... I don't think you're sick. And you look good to me. As for the kiss... Kind of enjoyed it. Yeah Sister, you're right. So much fun being a nun. What? You don't like cleaning dirty sheets? Hey! Sister Charlotte, Mother Superior needs you in her bedroom. Have I done something wrong? No. We need help with the inspection. Hello, Sister Charlotte. We've been waiting for you. Sunday is a big day for Lily. She's gonna join our family, become one of us. You know, to become a nun you have to give your love your heart, and your virginity to God. Remains to be seen how much you love God but we have to know that you're a virgin. Come girl, lie back. Charlotte. She's a virgin. I can't hear you, Sister Charlotte. She's a virgin. Thank you, Sister Charlotte. You did beautifully, my dear. Very brave. Oh Lord! Oh Lord, help me! Help me! Help me not to succumb to the temptation! Help me! I saw you with Lily. I know how you feel. I've been there many times before. What's wrong with me? I've never felt this way before. The butterfly's in your stomach? The strong desire to be with her? To hold her in your arms? To taste her lips To touch her body I remember when it first happened to me. Before I was transferred, I belonged to another convent. I had just left my family and I was alone, and scared. When I met Sister Leah she took care of me. She showed me around, she instilled confidence, and peace in me. But she also taught me something I will never forget. She taught me how to love, and how to be loved. ...but the one to celebrate your body. Give in. Give in, and indulge in that feeling of pleasure and love. Do you wish to be loved? Yes, I do. Do you truly wish to be loved? So much. Then allow me to love you like the beautiful woman that you are. The warmth of your lips... Your breath... Your boby is a beautiful thing and our job is to celebrate it. Cherish it, worship it. You're meant to be worshipped. Created to be loved. Just listen to your body... Listen to what your heart desires. There is a reason every inch of your skin is tingling. It is craving to be touched. For many, many years it's been longing for a sweet, sensual, passionate touch. Do not feel guilty my child. This is what you need. This is what you were created for. Indulge and let go. Surrender your body to me. Surrender your body to me... Skin was created to be this soft so I could adore it. So I could caress it. So I could worship every inch of it. Tingling with this out here, aren't you? Yes... Are you? Yes. Oh yes... It's tingling. Do you want to be loved? Oh, I want to be loves so much! Tell me again. Please love me... Repeat to me what your body has been craving for, over and over again. It needs to be loved... It needs to be loved... Oh yeah... Oh my God... Look at me. You look at me as you surrender yourself to my touch... Been waiting to feel your juices for so long. The warmth of your body... The burning desire just dripping all over me. You're blessed! Your eagerness needs to be satisfied. You're real God's creation, to it's fullest. You feel it's perfect creation that's meant to be celebrated. Every inch of you deserves to be worshipped. Every... Inch... There's no wonder... That the slightest parts of our body are the most sensitive, delicate ones. They're meant to be adored. Come to me. To reveal you... Let your body be blessed by the light and let's reveal the perfect creation that you are. Drift away... Drift away in thought... Drift away in pleasure. Let your body be worshipped the way it's meant to. Allow me to worship every inch of your skin. A beautiful creation you are. You felt my blessings all over you Yes... Do you wish me to go on? Please continue. You wish for me to touch the inside of your body? Yes. Do you wish to be touched deeper until the core of your soul just shivers and shakes? Do you? - That's all I want! It was the best moment of my life. And then what happened? Did you see her again? No. They found out and we were sent to different convents. And you never tried to contact her? I don't know where she is. Maybe it is better this way. Women are not meant to lay together. That's what they want you to believe. They want you to believe it's wrong to love someone other than different sex. They want you to believe that we were created by God to be with a man. They claim that's a disease. They say it's immoral and perverted, but those are lies. It is beautiful... It is magical... It is love, real love. And you should never fight that. If you wanna be with someone. If you love someone. Sex doesn't matter. But... Blasphemy! This is all blasphemy! I warned you, young lady! We forgave you! We took you under our roof! And this is how you repay us? What are you doing? Charlotte, it's time for you to leave. What are you going to do? I said it is time for you to leave! Oh my- Ask God for forgiveness! Mother Superior! Mother Superior! What's wrong? It's sister Mona! She's gone insane! I'm scared she's gonna do something bad! What happened? She caught Riley talking about sex! Oh my gosh, where is she? In Riley's room, come on! Beg God for forgiveness! Beg-God-For-Forgiveness! Beg God for forgiveness! Sister Mona, that's enough! Stop it! She was corrupting the mind of her Sister. There's something wrong going on behind these walls! These girls are lost and they need guidance. Somebody has to teach them what's right! And I think you're losing touch. Stop it! Listen to yourself! Do you believe any of it? What is wrong with you? It's about time. It's about time you start to take an interest in me again. I made you suffer. And you didn't deserve it. Did you even feel sorry for me? Of course. My feelings for you have not changed. Show me. You're still so beautiful. You are still so beautiful. I haven't forgotten the taste of your lips. Or the feel of your touch. If you can remember how to do this, it's been so long. So beautiful. Such memories. I want more! So much more... Strip. Oh no, I confess... I confess, I confess! I think you told the truths of today. And that you've punished me long enough. The games I used to play... You were always such a feisty one! Always needed correction. Get on the bed. Spread your legs. Spread 'em. Nice light. Let me see inside the gates of Heaven. I have missed you. You don't forget anything, do you? Oh that's... So good. Ooh, my God... Oh fuck yes! Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes! Oh yes please! Oh yes, oh my goodness! It's been so long! Oh, another finger please. You have more reach than I, it's not fair where you can reach! Is that the spot? - Yes! Stay! After that day everything changed in the convent. Sister Mona asked to be transferred to another convent. And Lily left. She left without saying goodbye. A few days before her first vows, she disappeared. As for me... Everything went back to normal. Of course, sometimes I still think about her. I dream about her. Unfortunately, nothing ever happened between us. Lily! Oh my God, it's been so long! Where have you been? Well, I became a nun. I can see that! I see you haven't changed at all. Thank you. You're still the strong and beautiful woman that I fell in love with. Thanks to you, I'm now able to live my life. I've come to accept the person I am today. You've truly made me the woman that I am. Don't be shy, Sister! I came here to thank you for everything! Thank you! No, don't go! I dreamt about this for so long Sister Riley told me that if there's love, then sex does not matter as a sin. That it's OK. I agree with Sister Riley. Oh God! I'm so happy. It's like I'm seeing you for the first time. Lay down so I can pleasure you. Oh Sister! Oh my God! Oh God... Oh Sister! That's amazing! Disrobe me. I want to show me pleasures. Oh Sister! You're even more beautiful than I imagined. How fun this is with somebody that you love Sister. I'm so glad you came back. I couldn't leave you. Ooh yes! Yes, Sister! Oh yes Sister, yes! Oh please, Sister! Yes! Oh my cup runneth over, Lily! I see! I've never felt such joy! I hope I bring you great pleasure. Look me in the eyes, I wanna see your soul! Yes, yes, yes! Oh, Sister Lily! I can't take it anymore. We must have you again, and again, and again. It's so beautiful. Oh my God! Oh yes Sister! Oh my God! Oh yes, yes, yes! I feel like I'm in Heaven, Sister. It couldn't get any better than this. Oh my God! Ooh yes! So wet! Exposed... You give me the chills. You make me so wet Lily! Fingers feels so good inside me! Fuck! Oh my God yes, oh my God yes... I like to hear you say the Lord's name, Sister. Oh my God I see stars! You have it on your face! I wanna sit on that pretty face. Do you now? You can do whatever you want, Sister. Are we done with the sheets? Oh yes! Feels so good! Oh Lily! Ooh yes! I love you so much Lily. This feels so good. Oh my God yes! Oh your tongue is so inside me! Yes right there. So good! Oh yes! Yes, yes... Oh my God, oh my God, oh my goodness! I've confessed this, because it is what I'm supposed to do. In the eyes of the Church, what I have done is wrong. But I must also confess, that I do not feel ashamed or guilty. Because what I feel for Lily, and what she feels for me is pure of heart. And that day in the sun, we felt God's loving light shining down upon us. And we were at peace. How can that be wrong? In time we must all answer to God, and all we can do is follow our own truth.
