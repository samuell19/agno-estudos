What about the other fellow? The one you changed the clothes with. - Who's he? - l'm not sure. Ranty, Shanty, know him as Canty, Tom Canty. A thief he said. What then? They maybe mistaken. The guards seized me and they beated me. They beated me. Then they threw me out of the road. Then you came along. l'm not hallucinating. l'm the Prince. Yes, l know you're. You, you. Who have you're? l'm Miles Hendon. lf you don't believe me, then why did you rescue me from that rapine? What profit could you hope for by risking yourself for me? Unless you knew l was the Prince. That's a very well reason. l saw one man standing alone... Cheers. You do not sit in my present. Now, look at you, my master. l'm not a patient man. You saved my life when l was down on the step ...any man who still keep... But l'm...Prince of Wales. Look, do you know the proof-- - l told you to keep that damn thing out of my sight. Where did you get it? lt's the Prince of Wales's seal. The way is amazing that fellow... from your chimney in the palace. Tom Canty, he's a thief ...was looking on. Well, master Canty. You may rest here tonight but tomorrow you've to return to... l'll not. l'll go to my rightful-- - That's what l say...there's where you're going to go because l'll take you down. l'm tired. l'd sleep. You'll sleep. There's no other guards. Good night. Good night. Master Hendon, your clothe's... sometimes you look like a gentleman. What are you? l'm a soldier. That probably eXplain your bad rude manners. Still, you...me great kindness. Your brave services is the any honor that l award you... Your Majesty is very kind. Yes, there's one thing since l dispite the comfort. May l ask forever we're going to privilege of sitting in the present loyalty. Not the Prince?! Not the Prince?! Do l not know my own son? He's enough standing there about my own height. l know my own...blood. Do you think me mad, then? No, sir. Your Majesty's mind's clear enough. We've spent some 4 hours on full... There stands the Prince but he denies himself even to Your Masjesty. My Lord, your son's mad. No! No! There's no other conclusion. Dr Buttes tells me that's such ...never known before. One day, same as you and l. Call him again. Let me speak with him. - You Highness. - l'm not Highness, sir. - You know me? - Yes, l'm. You're the King. But l'm not your...l'm Tom. Neither Tom or do l care. lt's your dad, boy. You'll not deny me. You'll not break my heart. Oh, l won't do that. But l told you, l'm not the Prince of Wales. l'm Tom Canty, a pauper. Still the same story. He truely believes himself. Well done. Raise me. Give me your shoulder, boy. Now hear me. My son's mad. But he shall not be a way so although studies had done it. ...hope something for him. So he'll be well again. He's mad but he's my son. Now mark this, all of you. Any man who speaks of the illness of the Prince, ...he'll pay for it for his head. No man shall speak of it. Not even the Prince. A Prince will not deny his royalty. He'll not call himself a pauper. Speaks of a pauper's speaks. Now, go! All of you. ...is mad. He's the Prince of Wales still. My Lord, have you no-- doubts? - Doubts? My Lord. Go on. We're alone. You're the Prince's... but it seems odd to me this manners should have change him so much. His word, his speech, and most of all his manner. He is just the same but he's somehow different. He's the Prince of Wales. My Lord, take notice but when l heard him swear he's not the Prince-- My Lord. No, no. My Lord. l mean no harm. l- l'... Say nothing of it. lndeed l shall not. We must all forget such doubts. Think now, if he wore imposture and swear he's not the prince, that was natural understandable. But would any impostor accepted by the King the... anyone as the Prince denied his royalty and claimed to be an impostor? No. No. No, My Lord. - That's what l said. Madness is mad. Made of a strange... Well, our Prince's not as mad as he as. ...for he's the Prince and soon will be our king. Where had the hell you been? Crawled in the...by the look at you. What you're trying to do to break your poor mother's heart? Shut up! l told you l want a five syilis cum supper but you'd missed it. Nipper! But you were just in time for breakfast. l ask you again, friend. ls this your son? l'm his father. What ever business...is yours? - My business is with this welfare which is why l'm returning him to ...to his loving family. l think he's mad. But there's the wonder. Even if you're his father, his's no common boy so l hope you treat him kindly. l use the best that the way he deserves. So look you mind you... Use him kindly. Remember. Madam, take care of your princekin. Hold it. Nipper! l'll put you in the bad... You've killed him. Killed him? Killed him have l? You're the witness. He started the whole thing. Murderer! Murderer! Let you get out of here. How do you he's dead? - He's...unconscious. Now, come on. Come on! Where can l go? How'd l live? -Join up the Ruffler's gang for a while. Yeah. l'll get something. And then, there was a pardoner and a...and the priest. And they're all going to Jerusalem. l heard the story for the years ago. l didn't laugh... Why didn't you start the medicine and... lf l might believe your medicine-- His royal Highness, the Prince of Wales. Come to me, boy. You look well. Give me your hand. l'm ill. You'll have to deputize for me. Where's the seal? Seal. Wear it. Wear it so that... Kiss me, Edward. And for the...you've committed, the sentence appoint you, Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk. You'll be taken hands in the morning and your hands chopped from the body. And may God have mercy upon you. Upon you too, sir, when your time comes. Highness. Kind of you to come to visit me, Your Highness. l'm afraid l've a little ...of hospitality. My Lord, l wish l can help you. l should help the poor pauper boy. And then, l... to the palace without punishment. That was very kind of you, my Lord. l've seen them and l remember. l'm deeply sorry, my Lord. You know death's fearing me. My Lord, read this to the king, your father. Remind him we'll meet again. Very soon. ls Your Highness not well? No. Yes, perfectly well. Then, wave. You fool. No, no. That's the pauper ...l'm the Prince of Wales. You want to be arrested and prisoned? l'm the Prince of Wales. - Shut up! He's my son. He means no harm. No harm. He just has mad fancy. God bless the Prince of Wales. God save Prince Edward. God bless him. Take it away. Carefully. lf you think it maybe poisoned, why not try on a dog or a... Yes. Your Highness.

True, he did break the monastry when l was a monk.. When l was a monk, l lived well, took from the poor and had all the nuns l want.

Hold your tongue. - He's sort of king drive-- - That's impostor, a pauper who has stolen my throne. Your majesty has better... back to London for once he has put up that crown on that pauper's head, it's goodbye to your throne forever. Yes, l must go quickly before l'm too late. Don't...wait.

Come in and tell me when it's ready. - But the safety and the good of it-- - l can not decide. l don't know. As Your Majesty please us. No, Jane. Don't go. You see what is this to be a king? l don't understand half of what they said. Why can't they make decision on themselves? Because Your Majesty's word is the law. Yes, that's true. Kings may do what they please, may not they? Yes, Your Majesty. - And the King must be obeyed? - lndeed, Your Majesty. What an eXcellent arrangement. Close your eyes. - Well? - Whatever Your Majesty wish is, it's your law and command. Please. Kings are lucky devils. But the council, shouldn't Your Majesty- - Oh, anyone can talk to the council. But there's something a king must do for himself. Pardon. Your Majesty. l had thought to find you alone. My sister, no ceremony. Please. lf l might seek a word with Your Majesty in private? Why? lt's only Jane here. Oh, very well then. Wait for me in the garden. Well, Edith. What do you come to me to talk about? l could boX your ears by God. What do l find in the corridor this minute, the privy counsellor of the ram chase out like idol school boy so that you could play your play with that hag-seed. How dare you talk to me like that? l'm dare more than that. Do you think the state runs itself or you can waive England business aside because you're too idol or too privilege or too hot of that ...baggage. l'll see how God help you. Respect? Respect? Now, mark me. Little brother. l may forget what it's due to you but l shall never forget what is due to something you seem to have forgotten. - And what might that be? - England. Oh, to see you so-- so change, so careless of all government, until your ministers're waiting like beggars at the door while you try flew away the time. - Oh, it's not worthy. - What l do is my affair, not yours. l'm the King and l do not need your advice or your fishwife tounge. - l've Your Majesty leave to go. - Yes! l'm the King, you hear? And l do what l like and the rules l please. lf the day has come when you're on the throne, then you can take care of England. By God l will. - lt's only little way now. - Every moment lost it's vital. - l-- -Call me not boy, sir. l'm your Majesty. Oh, Your Majesty. Pardon. lf Your Majesty would be pleased to take gracious note, Your Majesty humble servant is tired and he's hungry and he's got blister on his feet. Now, my home is just down the hill. Look, there we can rest, we can eat and we can sleep. And l swear l'll send you safe to London where you could be crowed to your heart content, Majesty. There it's. Hold. l see your maple tree is missing. But it has been a long time. Since you were... l'm following the way which l have to show what. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 wounds in something pounds and...money. And l dream with the returning of the fortune, boy. Oh, Majesty. Thi's mine. Mine! And this's will be waiting. The lady whom l shall marry. But first l've to see how my brother he'll be looking after my... Oh, Royal majesty. Come, boy. Here, the hall. Do you like it? lt's you. Good to see you. Sir, l do not understand. Oh, no.

Whoever you're, you're mistaken. l do not know you, sir, nor this fellow who may be. ...this fellow, he's mad but l'm your brother. My brother, l know there's more than one mad man in my home. Call the grooms. Put this fellow out. You hold, sir. My God...you deny me... lt's-- l've come home. Edith. You do not know this man. My brother Miles is dead last three years. This's an impostor.

Williams, give this noisy cow by taste your whip. Let him yell to some purpose. Come, boy. You dare! Let them beat me. Leave him alone. Very well. Take him to his word. And you, you can speak as much as you like but for every word you utter he gets siX slashes more. Beat him. Please. You. You're brave, good-hearted, the King will not forget. ...Miles Hendon May God to...you haven't met me. Go boy. Get out of here.

Edith. l thought you're dead. You would never come. So many years no words from you and l always waited. And then three years ago you showed me a letter and that said-- said you'd been killed in Germany and...died too. As for the letter was false, but why did you do not know me? He knew you were coming. One of the groom saw you're on your way here. He said no one must recognize you that anyone did he'll kill you. He said every one must deny you're Miles Hendon. You don't understand how powerfully he has become where the people here are going terror with him. ls that why you married him? ls it? Out of fear? No. He hold my father's dead. You know how poor we were. And then when l thought you were dead-- Never mind. lt doesn't matter. There's a horse for you and your friend.

For my sake, please. l-- l would leave it. But that's for your sake. Am l...the country like ...a pauper without a name? Even shouted from the roof top l'm Miles Hendon, nobody will believe me. Am l to be a...shadow? Unrecognize this inheritance lost staring by myself in the mirror asking who l'm not getting enough. God damn this madness boy! That's what eveyone will say. You're not mad.
