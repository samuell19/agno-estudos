Young man. Have you laid tefillin yet? Do you need a worker? Anton! I'm sorry, that's not what we agreed upon. No, no, that's not what we agreed upon. Honestly, is that why you called? No, it's not negotiable. 34 is my final price. Just a minute... Hello. - Are you looking for a worker? Max. Max, are you there? Max. Max, it's 10 already. Max? Max... Is there a son, brother or father here who can say kaddish? Magnified and sanctified be God's great name. - Amen. In the world which He created according to His will. May he establish His kingdom during our lifetime and during the lifetime of Israel. Amen. - Amen. May God's great name be blessed forever and ever. - Amen. Blessed, glorified, honored and extolled, adored and acclaimed be the name of the Holy One. - Amen. Though God is beyond all praises and songs of adoration which can be uttered, let us say Amen. - Amen. Let He who makes peace in the heavens grant peace to all of us and to all Israel. - Amen. I'm so sorry... May you never know sorrow. May you never know sorrow. I'm sorry, Mr. Fidelman. You'll have to help your father now. I don't think my father will accept any help. He has to accept, he won't be able to manage without Malamud. Avi, got any almonds? Go sit down. I'll be there in a minute. I'll do what I can. If I stand up, won't I get almonds? - You will, I'll bring them to you. Go, sit down. Bless you. Start with this. - What is it? It's your father's bill. Malamud paid it at the beginning of every month. I unintentionally got pregnant for the 2nd time. It was hard. It was so difficult with both of them. I just couldn't... Quiet please! The Turk wants to say a few words. Friends... Mr. Fidelman, a few words please. I've been coming to this Polish thief's place for over 30 years. When I first came Malamud was already a veteran here. He received me in his suit and had a smile on his face. I immediately thought to myself: "A putz." Since then, he caused countless power failures in my carpentry, caused problems with parking... Once he helped me by lending me a cable... and he never let me forget it! Do you realize the harm you're doing? - Stop it, please. I know. I don't need you to tell me. If you know... It can be born too small. A million things can happen. You are getting on my nerves! It does more harm to the baby than a cigarette once in a while... - It's not once in a while. If it were once in a while, ok, but it's not... Cheers! - Cheers. What? Sorry. I thought I knew you. Sorry. What's your connection to Fidelman? - I've just started working for him. I'm Noah's wife. The son? Yes, the son. Would you like a cup of tea? - No, thank you. You really should drink. - I'm fine, thanks. The Turk spoke well, didn't he? Don't you want to say a few words? No, what can I say? Who's that guy? - Who? Ah him. Don't know. He worked for us for about a day. Need anything? Any help? No, thank you. I'm going outside to smoke. Mr. Fidelman. I'm very sorry. People seem to have liked him. Be strong... His son is heartbroken. That's my son. He had no children. That's why Noah said kaddish. Back to work on Sunday. Same arrangement. Breakfast and lunch on us. You, mother and Malamud. That's at the Pole's place, isn't it? - Yes. Was she already sick here? Maybe. I don't think so. Don't remember when it was taken. You know it's not about me. Dad will do what you tell him to do. You've worked like dogs your whole lives. Enough! You deserve a few years of peace. Your ravioli, sir. - Thank you. Not bad! He always said there was a problem with the camera. He'd set it to video mode instead of still mode. I'll take it... Downstairs. There's something "on" here. I pressed some button. You're good at those things. Noah's about to become a partner. Congratulations. So why are you upset? I'm not. I'm tired and old. Come and show me how tired you are... Leave the camera alone. Max? Is everything ok? Max? Seeing as a man's time of death is unknown to him and everyone wishes to give instructions what should be done with their property after their death, I, being of sound mind and under no constraint, instruct that my property be divided after my death as follows: The contents of my jewelry safe at the bank, I bequeath to my cousin Shimon Arazi. My Woody Guthrie records and all my folk records, together with the contents of the apartment on Matalon Street, I leave to Yaakov Fidelman, my partner and old friend. As for my share in Malamud-Fidelman Antique Furniture Restoration I bequeath it to Noah Fidelman, Yaakov's son, who was like a son to me. Thank you for everything. Sorry and farewell. Want to eat something? I didn't know anything about it, Dad. I'm not going to interfere or anything. I'm busy anyway. I've been offered a partnership in a month or 2. Looks serious this time. Congratulations. Until then I'll have to work my ass off and they know it. You invited him to the Italian place, didn't you? I did. - Why? What did you want? Why do you think I wanted something? You know Waldman from the municipality building department? - No. He's a client of ours. He owes me a favor, a big one. I talked with Malamud about it. Waldman can get you building permission. Why do I need building permission? - You don't. I told you, I discussed it with Malamud. You could build on the workshop, 6 floors of apartments, make 100% on the first 2 floors and another 75% on the 4 other floors. Take a good contractor and you can gain 2 apartments, even 3. Malamud liked the idea. Would you like to eat? - No, thanks. If you like the idea I can talk to Waldman. It's the right thing to do, Dad. You need to think of everything. Should I talk to him or not? Thank you. Don't bury me yet. Hello. How's life? Anton! Anton! Great armchair, huh? Big fuss over nothing... like all early 20th century Venetians. But you've got to have some fuss. Fuss? Malamud used to say "you've got to have some fuss". See these curves? Here and here? They weren't here before. She was damaged. I had to go in by the millimeter. Should I prepare this chair too? Prepare? What do you mean prepare? To start sandpapering. Just remove the paint. Take this lady to the upholsterer, something simple, nothing fancy. Ok. Yes. Thank you. Yes. Almost 70. Cardiac arrest. Yes. Thank you. You too. Goodbye. Answer that. If it's work, pass it over to me. If it's condolences, say "Thank you" and hang up. I'm going out to get cigarettes. Need anything? Good night, Mr. Fidelman. - Bye. What's this? Where does this shit come from? It's not shit. For years you've had a negative balance sheet. Yes, but such amounts? Why didn't you say anything? - I told Malamud. Malamud... Why didn't you tell me? How should I tell you? You never came to my office. How am I supposed to tell you? Am I asking you for a favor? I'm asking for a loan. But you're not listening. It's not up to me. It's bank policy. I'm sorry, Yaakov. It won't work without a mortgage. - Don't be sorry and don't make excuses. - Dad. - Banks give loans... Is this a bank or what? - I'm sorry, Yaakov. The bank has a policy! - Enough, Dad! Have you calmed down? Zadikov, we've been with you since you were a teller, Dad, Malamud and I, right? Yes or no? - Yes, right. So, after 20 years, we need your help. I said it's possible but you need a mortgage. A mortgage at his age is not a solution. Without the loan my father's finished. He's got nothing to sell. Stop babbling! You want to give a loan, give it. If not, don't. No way will you take out a mortgage, not at your age. The slightest thing happens and... I don't want to think about it. The new boy. How much do you pay him? Nothing. Peanuts. Plus lunch. You haven't even got that now. Let him go at the end of the month. - I need someone there. Do you know anything about him? Who is he? I need someone there. So make him fill in a social security form. I'll bring you one. If something happens it's big pain in the neck. It's good for expenses too. You need to have expenses. I'll do a tour of the banks. Maybe... I could arrange something with better terms. It'll be ok, Dad. - Thanks. Here, I'll light it for you. Wow! That was beautiful! You play beautifully. Do you know anything about music? - A bit. You don't come here often, do you? - Why do you say that? This is Fidelman's chair. Boy or girl? We don't want to know. Hello. I'm supposed to meet Noah here. Isn't he with you? No. Maybe he's back at work. I don't know. He said he'd be here this afternoon. He's going over the books, isn't he? I don't know. Strange. Maybe I... Maybe I got confused. Sweet. Ok, I won't disturb you two. Bye. - Bye. Bye, Maestro. What's this? What happened here? An accident. I'm taking it out of your wages. Now clean up the mess you made! I'm stuck here. Just a minute. You were on that "Singing Teens" show. That's where I know you from. Do you still sing? - No. Bye. Just a minute... Talk to you in a minute, ok? What? This! Yes. I'm sorry. The paint remover burned my fingers. You killed her! I told you to only remove the paint, not to sandpaper it! Did I or did I not tell you?! I'm sorry, Mr. Fidelman. My fingers were burning. It doesn't help! What will I tell the client?! Are you going to talk to her? - Lf you want me to. Get out of here. I don't want to see you any more! Get out. Hello. Hello. - Wow! I didn't know such shops still exist. This place is charming. - Thank you. Can I help you? - I'm looking for a young man called Anton. I heard he hangs out here. Not anymore. I let him go. He did damage here. Maybe you know where he is? Where he lives? No. Are you sure? Yes. Charming. Mahogany, right? - Yes. - English? - Venetian. I'd give you 10,000 for it. - It's already sold. Your brother was here. Thank you. He asked me to let you know that your family's looking for you. You can go now. - Mr. Fidelman... What if I told you there's something in your workshop that's worth all your debts and also all the money you make in a year? It looks like a typical German Steinway. If it's an imitation, they've done a great job. Wait! It says Hamburg. Anton, bring me a cloth please. Thank you. There's an "s" but "s" can also be the initial for Steinweg. Here, Hamburg. It's written again here. Here. Steinway. Steinway, Hamburg 1882. Ok, guys, we have an antique Steinway piano here. Can you estimate how much such a thing is worth? I need to finish checking it. Either it's worth a ton of money or it's worth nothing. This is ok. What's this? - No, this is ok. Moths... that's to be expected. This is ok. What's this? Shit! What? - Not good, not at all good. What's wrong? There's a crack here, the whole length of the Panzer. So? - Look, you can see it here. The panzer is the frame, the heart of the piano. It holds... There's 20 tons of pressure on it from the strings and there's a crack. The whole length. Ok. So we'll weld it. You can't weld such a thing. - No, he's right. It's cast iron. How can you weld cast iron? You can't. No way. And if we replace the frame? Listen, this isn't some TV set from Taiwan that's got spare parts sitting on a shelf. If you find another such Panzer, it means you've found a similar piano. And I have no idea where you'd find another such piano. The crack goes the whole length. It won't hold. - I got it. It won't hold. - I got it, I got it. How about casting? We could cast a new frame. - No way. It's very expensive. The slightest deviation and it won't fit. You see, here, the entire length. How much did you say it was worth? It could be as much as $100,000 according to the expert. The expert said nothing. What's with the banks? Nothing yet. I've got a meeting on Tuesday. A friend from school. It'll be ok, I'm sure. I'm telling you it'll be ok. It's a friend. We can find a solution for the frame if we find a "dead" Steinway, something old but of the same model, with a good frame. Take it back to the storeroom. Here you are. Bon appetit. - Thank you. The gefilte fish is good today. The horseradish is sharp. - Yes. How are you? The usual. I found this at Malamud's. - What is it? Wow. A piece of history. This was taken here. Your beer. Here are the 3 of you, the 3 Musketeers. Very moving. Tell me, did you know he was seeing a young woman? So? - You knew? Did he give you this? - A long time ago. He said it helps... Sometimes. Everything ok? How's your mother? Give her my regards. Good morning, Mr. Fidelman. What a devoted job! It wasn't me, it was Fidelman. Should I put it somewhere? Just leave it here for now. Maybe here, to the side until... Noah wants us to get everything new. Maybe I'll give it away. He never comes here anyway. Who? - Yaakov. Why do you work for him? - Why not? Why don't you play music? - Why don't you sing? Because I'm not really good at it. Neither am I. Look. This is his project. I want a girl, not a boy. - Why? Because... Noah wants a boy. A boy, a boy, a boy, a boy. That's all he wants. Did Noah say anything about the piano? What should he have said? Didn't he tell you? I told him there was someone at work who knows about pianos. Where do you work? - At the theater. - Do you act? No. Costumes. Sometimes I help out with the set and... never mind. There's a guy who knows about piano parts. I told Noah to tell you about him. Ok. If you want I can put him in contact with you. Look, he needs the loan. Without his workshop he's finished. He's been there 40 years. Does he do kitchens? - No, I told you. He's a restorer. He restores antique furniture. Yes, but at least kitchens are a stable thing. If I convince you to take a mortgage I'll be screwing you. If I give the loan without a mortgage I'll be screwing myself. Your balance sheet doesn't look good. What've you done? Nothing. You've done something. You know how often I've cleaned these damn shelves? You probably worked on some armchair or chest. It's ok. I spent 10 years around here as a child, during the school year, the holidays... 2 years working here after the army. I got up to mixing the varnish. He never let me finish a piece of furniture. Both of my hands I burned here. Feel this. Feel, feel. Smooth, huh? The paint remover burnt it all. After a year here you lose your fingerprints. So why didn't you stay? I'm making coffee. Want some? I met your wife. She told me about the piano guy. Where did you meet her? Why didn't you tell your father about the piano guy? It's fantasy, nothing concrete. Want coffee? What's up, Edward? Out of respect for my friend Malamud I'm saying no. What do you mean? Look, Mr. Fidelman, Malamud was a friend like in Georgia. A friend in Georgia is not like a friend in Israel. If I give you the money and you can't pay it back I have to use my methods: Either to take the shop instead of money or send people for the money. Out of respect for his friend Malamud, he can't do it. You're giving me bullshit, Edward. 4 years ago you gave Malamud a $30,000 loan. Weren't you worried then that you might have to use your methods? With Malamud I knew I'd get my money back. With you I don't know. You're not the only one. I'll go to your competitors. - So go. I want to see who'll lend you money. Anyone who lends you money will take your shop too. I'm doing you a favor. - Take your favors and stuff them! For 40 years I've been passing by your shop. Have you ever invited me in for a cup of coffee? If not for Malamud I would never even have seen the inside of the shop. Without Malamud nobody will give you money. Who you are without Malamud? You're nothing, a nobody. Hey, man, what's up? Let's go to Zadikov. Everybody's shit. At least he's a shit we know. Let's build a building, Dad. I'll get the permits and we'll build a building, a great building. Let's do it together, you and I. Think of the security it'll give you. I don't want security. I want you to come with me to Zadikov, I need your signature too. - We'll lose everything with a mortgage. Dad. Do you want to be left with nothing? Worried about your inheritance? I want there to be something left for my child. Be at Zadikov's tomorrow morning. Dad, your business is dead. Who restores furniture nowadays? You have no money to pay the suppliers. You don't even have money to pay Anton. He's deducting wages from your paycheck, isn't he? With Malamud, you managed. People came for him. But now? Look at this place. It looks like a junk yard. This armchair's been sitting here for 6 months. You're nothing without Malamud. A junk collector. Noah. Noah. Everything's ready. Where's Noah? He's sick. Give me the form. He'll sign it at home. It has to be in my presence. You know that. What's going on, Yaakov? I need this loan. I'll be happy to give it to you but your son needs to come here. How was Turkey? I'll go to your wife, Zadikov. I know what's going on with your little whore, the teller who works here. Esther. I left home 2 weeks ago. My wife knows everything. If you want the loan bring your son here and I'll be happy to give it to you. Hi. - Hi. Are you Yaakov? - Yes. You called for a girl? Where do you want it? In here? In the bedroom? In the kitchen? Are you shy? I don't... I don't... You don't what? Did you want another girl? Smaller? Yes. Well I'm like 2 small girls... Come on. I... Pay me and I'll go. Yes, I'll pay you. Yes you will. How much? - They told you on the phone. Wait a minute. I'm very sorry. I don't... - No, I'm not taking photos. I just want to ask you something. There's something "on" here. I pressed some button. You're good at those things. Noah's about to become a partner. Congratulations. So why are you upset? You don't say such things. Even if I knew. I'm not doing... - Even if you do nothing. It's dangerous. Simply dangerous. Wait a minute... It's just because you're sweet. 5 Levanda Street. Go up. Ask for Clarice. Ok? - Yes. Don't write anything down. Anywhere. 5 Levanda Street. Upstairs. Clarice. Mr. Fidelman? Is something wrong? Mr. Fidelman, maybe you need stitches? Enough with the "Mr. Fidelman"! Show me your hand. - Leave me alone! Damn it! Show me your hand! You can't go on living in the workshop. Why did you come to work for me? It does me good. Why? Don't know. I used to wake up in the morning... And feel that nothing... That dreams were more real than this. It's temporary, until I find a place. Thank you. We'll take a day off tomorrow, go back to work the day after. Ok, great. Yes, I owe you one. Thanks. Yes, I know. Bye. Ok, we have something. He thinks it's hopeless but he gave me the name of someone who's meant to be a real big wig in pianos. A guy called Haled. If such a thing exists, he'll be the one to know about it. Here. You're coming with me, aren't you? Why not? - Now? I'm in the middle of work! You know Noah thinks this whole thing with the piano is a load of nonsense. Yes, he thinks it's just a fantasy. He told me. I won't tell him. So is it a yes? A no? 1882 Steinway. Upright. Yes, I might have someone. If I can get something out of it for myself. A piece of junk. Nothing... Expensive. - Yes. How did you find me? - Through Haled. - Haled? I don't know any Haled. An Arab? It's an Arab name. Ok, so he's an Arab. - He... Haled... He knows Mr. Wallenberg. Mr. Wallenberg died 3 months ago. I'm sorry. I didn't know. - Never mind. Would you like some cake? Yes, thank you. It looks delicious. It's store bought. I'll get you a napkin. What are you expecting? A boy or a girl? I don't know. I thought everybody knows nowadays... Well, someone always has to be different. About the piano, Mrs. Wallenberg. - The piano... What an instrument it was... Was? - Yes. I sold it. A week after my husband died. Here, take a napkin. Do you remember who you sold it to? A dealer. He bought everything. Robbed me. But what do I care? What can I put in here? And I'll be able to have even less in my next apartment. What can you put in a coffin? And we Jews don't even have a coffin. Never mind. You're Jewish, aren't you? It's unimportant, really. Take a napkin. Thank you. Maybe you remember the dealer's name? There are so many names. His name isn't one of ours, if you get my point. A darkie, that I remember. But he was very polite. Was it Malamud by any chance? How strange! That was his name! Do you know him? Yes. How is he? He's dead. Him too? Oh, well. At least he managed to rob me first. More cake? - Thank you. - I'd like some. There you go. - Thank you. Slowly. You eat too fast. Is there any point in trying to find a frame for it? We could cast a new frame. That's complicated. The slightest mistake, even a millimeter, and it won't fit. It's worth a try, isn't it? We could go to a professional who would do it for us. Here, I'll do it. It's a matter of several thousands. I haven't got a penny. I haven't even got the money for your wages next month. Forget about money. I'll find the money, and we'll be partners in the piano. We'll take it step by step. Start with cleaning. We need to remove 100 years of paint and dirt. Then water. We need to let the wood breathe, remove everything that's accumulated inside. Then we have to fill in all the cracks. After that, paint and then varnish. And finally the glaze. Here. You can begin whenever. Hi. - What's going on? Nothing. I've got a bit of time to spare. Want to go out for coffee? - I just had one... Has something happened? - Should something have happened? You're here... I didn't get the partnership. Never mind. Maybe next year? We'll manage. We're fine. Everything will be ok. - Maybe... That scratches it. Did he give you the tools? - Yes, what's the problem? No problem. So you're restoring the piano. - Yes. Anton, come and eat. What happened to your hand? Can you work like that? - Anton's working. 2 of Barashi's checks bounced. We need to talk, Dad. You'll have to talk to me in the end. Are you blind? He's a spoiled child who's run away from home. He's playing games with you. What's your game now? A worker in a workshop? Why not? He's well off. He can go on playing for years. Has he told you he has a brother who can afford to buy the entire street? I know. Why do you hate me, Dad? Cut the bullshit. I've been fair with you... Always. I killed myself so that you have everything you needed. On my own. Here, pour yourself a drink. You went to Malamud behind my back to close down my business. Did you or didn't you? Did you or didn't you? - Yes, I did. Then you sent your wife here. What for? To see what your property was worth? Do you think I'm stupid? So I made a mistake. But I'm your son. Right? Noah... Anton? I've come to propose to buy your half of the workshop. Come in. Where's the money from? The sale of the piano? What does it matter? From your brother? You won't see a penny from your father. He doesn't want you there. - You're full of shit, aren't you? You know what? No. I don't want to sell. Want to drink something? You'll lose everything, Noah. I don't think so. How much longer does my father have? 2 years? 3? 10? How much can he blow in a year? $10,000? No matter how much he wastes it's still worth waiting. In the end it'll all come to me. Why? Do you think it'll go to you? Hi. - Hi. Noah! Noah! Stop! Stop! Noah! What's going on between you and him? Huh? What's going on between you and him? Add some. What're you doing? You're making mud. Add some. - Hello. Hello. Are you looking for Noah? He's not here. I know. I was in the area. I thought... I'd come and say hello. And thank you for the cradle. - You're welcome. It's really nice here. Pity I don't come more often. Hello. How are you? - Fine. Working on the piano. Mr. Fidelman is teaching me how to varnish. Have you got time for coffee? Tea. One sugar. - Mr. Fidelman? Coffee. No, no. That's too much. You'll suffocate it. I put the amount you told me to. So put less. It's the 2nd layer. You'll suffocate it. I'm exaggerating with the varnish. Can I try? You'll get dirty. - I'll be careful. Wait. Relax your hand. Relax it. Can you feel the wood? No. Thin out the varnish. Doesn't if feel strange? No. Do you like it? Yes. I'd go in there if I could. What? I can't. Why not? Stop. It can't happen. - Why not? Stop. I don't do anal or bizarre. What? - I don't do anal or bizarre. You can put your clothes there. What would you like? Shy? I like shy ones. Don't be anxious. You'll have a huge erection in no time. I'm Malamud's partner. Who's he? Maxim Malamud. He lives on Matalon Street. A short guy. Laughs a lot. Should I know him? He photographed you when you were at his place. What do you want from me? He's dead. - What's that got to do with me? I was his partner for 40 years. Do you want to have sex with me? What do you want? Are you screwed or what? So get out. Get out. Get out! - Wait a minute. - You want me or the security guard? Wait a minute. I only want to talk. I don't know your friend. What do you want? - I just want to talk. So talk. He... Did you go to him often? - Once a week. Since when were you? What? Since when were you? A few years. 4 or 5. Is that all? There was somebody else before but he got fed up with her. He wanted someone he could also talk to. Was he good to you? Better than a husband. Once he even lent me money and didn't want it back. Really. He loved me. How much do you earn a month? I used to make 6,000 a night when I had clients I went out to. But he was the last one I went out to. Want to know how it happened? - Yes. He was as usual, a bit tired. Put on one of his records. Said something about his son, that he'd had success in his office or something. He always talked about him. - His son. Yes, he liked to talk about him. And then we started... and suddenly he was dead. I'm sorry. Want to do it? We still have time. My son's about to be a father. - Congratulations. A girl or a boy? I don't know. So why are you like this? I think he'll be a good father. That's good, isn't it? Yes. One string is in place. Patience, patience. There are 200 to go. Hold the one next to it. - Ok. - Got it? - Got it. It must be accurate, Ok? - Ok. The one next to it? Is it in? Yes, it'll hold. She'll hold. Patience, patience. Hold the one next to it. Is it in? Wait, wait. Hold it. Is it in? Ok? - Yes. It'll hold. Gentlemen, we have a Steinway! She made it. How about some more wine? - Yes, yes. There are things you don't do. I don't know what's going on between you two, but leave her alone. She belongs to someone else. I don't want you to see her anymore. Are you forbidding me to see her? You should find your own girlfriend, a girl who can love you back. Why? Do you think she can't love me? She's pregnant with my son's baby. You don't do such things. Why not? Just because he put a few drops inside her a few months ago? Enough. Your son is a piece of shit. He's not a son. Your ravioli, sir. Is everything ok with the food? Dad, it needs more soap. Don't worry. Go home, Shaike. Tell Mom I'll be there soon. What's that good for? - Don't tell me what's good for me. Noah, go home. I'm paying you. Pour another one. Cheers. Drink up and go. - Worried about me? Don't worry about me. Worry about yourself. I've got a job. A kick-ass job. I've got an asset worth millions. You don't need to worry about me. I'm the kind of guy who always knows what to do. In case you haven't noticed. Hava Fidelman. She's my wife. One moment. I'll check which room she's in. I only brought her here. She asked for grape juice. Thanks. Is this piano yours? Yes. Can I look? Niv? Madam. Niv? - Madam! Where have you been? What are you doing here? - Mom, ask how much the piano costs. This one? What do you need this piano for? It's old. Is it even for sale? - Ask. What for? There's a piano at the community center. I want to practice at home too. Where would we put it? - In my room. - Where in your room? In the corner. - Which corner? You haven't got a corner. Let's go. There is a corner. Mom, please, just ask. Is the piano for sale? Yes. 1,000 Shekels. Can we get a discount? 900 Shekels. Come on, Mom. What will we tell your father? Ok, check it out. See if it's any good. He looks like you. Subtitles: Cinematyp Studios Ltd.
