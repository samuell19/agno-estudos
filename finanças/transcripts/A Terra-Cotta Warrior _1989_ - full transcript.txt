General Mong, we are already two days behind schedule. His Majesty wants the project to be completed within four months. And when we construct the West Mausoleum, there will be two days delay. If this is the case, we will all be beheaded. I have already recruited 50,000 peasants. We should be able to complete it on time. They are only flesh and blood. We can't push them too hard. Ahh... Run, run!! The statue is falling down. Run... Hurry, go and help the others. Long live Your Majesty. Take this back to the palace. Yes, Your Majesty. Dare try to you murder the Emperor?! Tyrant, don't run... You won't escape this time. Go to hell... Tyrant, you can't get away this time... Tyrant, don't run... Don't run... You won't get away... Your Majesty, I was late and I should be punished. Your Majesty, please punish us for our lateness in rescuing Your Majesty. You fools! I'll kill you all! Who are you? Your Majesty, I am Mong Tien Fong. Long live Your Majesty. What is your present position? Your Majesty, I am now in charge of the construction of the Imperial Mausoleum. Mong Tien Fong. You've won merits in saving my life. I now confer you the title of Chamberlain. Take this Royal sword for your reward. Thank you, Your Majesty. Come with me to the Palace. Yes, your Majesty. I'm leaving for the palace tomorrow and I'll entrust the project to you. You'd better take care of yourself and if you can't tell wether they are good or bad... the sound of rebellion is now echoing throughout the country. The emperor is so tyrannical and so ruthless that I don't understand why you are so loyal to him. Take out all the books... Please don't burn the books... Please don't... I beg you, please give them back to us... I beg you, please don't burn the classics. Dad, let's go. Dad. Dad! Dad, are you alright? Dad! Dad!! Unifying the country, standardising the written language, measurements and gauges. Isn't it amazing? Here in my hand is a coin I will order to mint after I've unified the country. It represents my great power and efforts. It will be circulated for millions of years. Long live Your Majesty. Hahahaha... There are many dangers lurking beyond the Great Wall. Yes, Your Majesty. Time flies in a wink. How short life is if I am to construct an everlasting empire. If only I could live forever... Your Majesty, the idea of immortality is nothing but a triviality. In my humble opinion... Hmmm? Be straightforward. I think the idea is only nonsense. Explain yourself. Your Majesty has already set a milestone in history. You will be remembered generations after generations. Longevity is beyond men's control. Please don't be too credulous! Mung Tian Fong, how dare you say such rash words to me? Your Majesty, I dare not. But I do understand... Your Majesty, we have conducted our experiments on rabbits. Normally, rabbits only have a life span of 3 or 4 years, but this one has already lived for 7 years after it has taken our elixir. And it still looks as young as ever. Your Majesty, please examine it yourself. This elixir takes 49 days to be refined. Long Live Your Highness. Hmm. Really, but what about the effects on men? How can I know about it? Your Majesty, let me test it for you. Your Majesty, let me have this honour. Terrific, have a duel and I'll decide who will test the elixir for me. Pass Chamberlain Mong's and General Kim's swords... Hey, look, the rabbit is dead. The rabbit is dead. Hurry up! Change it to another one. General Mong, please. General Kim, please. What a great warrior. Ha! Ha!... Your Majesty, it's my pleasure to serve you. Mong Tian Fong, just stay by me. I have another important job for you. Yes, Your Majesty. General Kim, you'll test the elixir for me. Yes, your Majesty. Damned alchemists. After ten years of experiments, you still have no solution to my longevity elixir. What's the point in keeping you? Bury them alive. I'll grant General Kim the honour to be a Terra-Cotta warrior. He'll guard my maosoleum forever. Your Majesty, please spare our lives. May I make a suggestion? What is it? Your Majesty, according to my knowledge, there are three islands situated at the middle of the Eastern Sea. On these islands, there live the deities who own the recipe of longevity elixir. If you can get hold of their elixir, you can fulfill your ambition. But this will be a long journey. We have to build vessels and recruit 500 boys and girls. Then we can get the elixir back for Your Majesty. I would very much like to have the honour to search for the elixir for Your Majesty. Long Live Your Majesty. Fine! I'll give you one more chance. You go and prepare all the necessities for the journey immediately. Mong Tien Fong, I order you to supervise them until they get off. I want to go home. I don't want to go to the palace. Come back! Keep moving! It's none of your business. Keep moving! Oh! They have come already! Wan Xiachan, Xin Shuying, Lee Pikwah, Hon Tong. What's the matter with her? Hey, come back! Don't leave... Give it to me. Come on, give it to me. You're already in the palace, so behave yourself. Don't do anything silly again. Come on, let's go back. Hey, the persimmons are so sweet. Come here. Wow! So many persimmons. They're really sweet. Here. Try this one. Don't just eat, let's go listen to the Bianzhong music. This way. Hey, wait for me. This way. Reporting, Chamberlain Mong. His Majesty is in great danger because of your abscence. You are ordered to report to His Majesty immediately. Protect Your Majesty. Go back to the palace. Don't try to hurt yourself again. Your Majesty, please punish me for being late. Your Majesty, the Chamberlain has arrived. Forward... Looks like there'll be a thunderstorm tonight. Come on, quick! Get inside. Hey, look. Is that the Chamberlain? Why is he kneeling there? I've heard that the Emperor wants to test his loyalty. Were it not for him, the emperor would have been murdered. No one would dare to go against the emperor's wish, would they? That's true! The Emperor is so ruthless. The thunderstorm is here and it's getting really windy. Come on, let's go! What a pity! The Chamberlain is really loyal to the Emperor. OK! You can all go back. Leave the Chamberlain to me. Yes! Good, you have proved your loyalty. You know you are the last person who can enter the royal chamber of the maosoleum without any harm. The rest are either made blind or deaf. Swear that you won't expose even a bit about the maosoleum. Got it? Yes, Your Majesty. Is this General Kim? Precicely. This underground empire is unique. There are thousands of Terra-Cotta warriors here which will guard my maosoleum forever. And they are... They are all criminals who have been sentenced to death. and they will be used in experimenting with the elixir. Your Majesty is too lenient to them. If the elixir functions, one of them will have an eternal life with me. But I don't want them, they are useless in strengthening my empire. I need some loyal officials to work for us. Are you loyal to me? Your Majesty. I have no merits or values. I'm afraid I am incompetent to share the glory with you. I have assigned you an important job. I hope you won't disappoint me. Are you alright? Yes, I'm fine. What is your name? Hon Tong. (Winter) You were born in the winter? Yes. My name is Mong Tian Fong. I've known that for a long time. What a delicate pair of shoes! They're made of silk. Excellent! Why don't you wear them? When I was a child, we couldn't afford to buy any shoes. And this is my first pair. I treasure them too much to wear them. Is your wound any better? Where are the islands? Are they very far from here? Yes, they're very very far away. Do we have to go tomorrow? Yes. Hon Tong, we've committed an unpardonable sin. We'll be condemned to death. His Majesty will never let us live together. Chamberlain, if we cannot live our lives together, I would rather die with you here. Good. We'll meet again in our next life. Chamberlain, you are wrong. If you two die for love here, His Majesty will learn of it. He will be furious about it. It doesn't matter if I'm killed. but those boys and girls will also lose their lives. I suggest that we act like nothing has happened. Once we set sail tomorrow, all of us will be safe. Just leave Hon Tong to me. I'll take good care of her. Chamberlain, please place the lives of these youths above everything else. Hon Tong, you must leave with the others tomorrow. Tian Fong, Tian Fong... Hon Tong... Wow! At last I succeded. Look! The longevity elixir is finally made. If you present this to His Majesty, we wouldn't have to leave. Nonsense! Although the elixir is made, it is not known wether it works or not. So you must not mention this to anybody. Come, boy. Master, what is it? Come on, hurry up, pour out all of it. Hurry up! Why? Master, all these can be used to make the elixir. Don't ask. Just do as I told you. Come here, dump them all into the drain. It's really a waste, they are so expensive and rare. Should we keep some? It's time to set off. Master, why do we set off so early? I said now and I mean it, so get moving. Yes, Master. Go back to the cabin. Back to the cabin... Oh! My goodness. What's going on? Why are the vessels leaving? Go and get them... Hey, there is a girl in the water. Go and get her. Chamberlain Mong. The vessels left suddenly. We've arrested this girl. They are gone. I am not going anywhere. I want to be with you, in death or in life. Mong Tian Fong, since you once earned merits in saving my life, I'll grant you one more chance. I'll toss a coin. If the tail is facing upwards, I'll spare your life. Otherwise, you have to die. His Majesty, the tail is facing upwards. Free the Chamberlain. And Hon Tong has to jump into the fire as a sacrifice to the Terra-Cotta warriors. Your Majesty, Tian Fong would not lead a shameful life. Please let me have the honour of guarding your mausoleum forever. Hon Tong! Nineteen Thirties Hi, everybody. Who is she? It will be announced soon. Is she the female lead? Come on, let's take some pictures. Hey, here comes our male lead. He flies his own plane. Who's on that plane? Your heartthrob. Don't you know that? Bai Yunfei? Yeah. Really? Hurry, go and meet him. Mr. Bai, I'm Lily Chu. Hi, everybody. Mr. Bai, I'm Lily Chu. If we can cooperate in this film, this film is gonna be the best. Mr. Bai, please... YunFei. How are you doing? Director, this is Miss Monica Yuan. How do you do, Miss Yuan? YunFei, let's go to the press conference. Miss Yuan, please. Damn! I thought she was the female lead. Lily, Lily, come and get your luggage Who do you think you are? This film is an international co-production between our Lilian Film Company and the famous producer Mr. Brown. For this movie, we've invited this famous actor and actress, Mr. Bai YunFei and Miss Monica Yuan, to be the lead actors. The story of this film is based on the famous novel " The Everlasting Love". Finally, I want to announce that this multi-million budgeted film will be the fist motion picture with sound in China. This film will surely set a milestone in the Chinese Film history. Thank you, everybody. Take a look youself. That's the style of a star. You still have a lot to learn. Would you shut up? You can never be a lead. Huh! Who knows if she will succeed? Mabye someday I'll be the lead in a big film with Bai YunFei. I'll be the most famous female lead in China. Let's wait and see! Let's go. Welcome to Xian... Mr. Cheng, is everyone here? Yeah, they are all here. Can we go now? Sure. Take 3. Cousin. You joined the patriotic movement against the Japanese. Oh! I'm so proud of you. We'll be homeless unless we win this war. I'll do my best to save our country. Cousin, you are so great! I've got to go now. Will you remember me? Cut! What's the matter with you? What's that sneeze, Lily? Sorry, I didn't mean to. Damn! We'll continue tomorrow. Miss Yuan, what bad luck you're working with such a sleazy girl. You're so good-tempered. We can never catch up with you. Huh! It's everyone's duty to join the patriotic movement... It's everyone's duty to join the patriotic movement... We have to fight for victory... That's the Yudi Pavillion and that is the Pethu Pavillion. Then this must be the Panlong Pavillion. Oh! Mr. Bai. I have just discovered the most probable location where the mausoleum in Xian might be. It must be somewhere around here. How can you be so sure? Because this is the best Fung Shui area in Xian. This spring of vigour merged with the Taichi must be the place where the dragon rests. Have you got anything to prove it? Of course. Just a moment. What is our present location? Right here... Right here?! Mr. Bai, take a look at this. It's not easy to find one of these. Please give me more money. You liar! I've paid you a lot but all I've got in return are fakes. Hey, what are you guys doing in here? Stand still! Hi, YunFei, YunFei. Director, are you guys filming in here? Oh! Yeah, we are... filming here. Carry on shooting. Lily, you look very pretty today. Here, put on my sunglasses to protect your eyes. See. Oh! I can't see anything. It's OK. You can see me, right? Let's go out and take a walk. OK! You carry on with the filming. Yes. Bye. Why doesn't the Boss do away with her? We have to check if she's a spy. Don't you guys worry, the Boss knows how to deal with her. You go back to the hotel and get changed. I'll pick you up later. OK! But don't take too long. Go on. Hey, Miss Star, where are you going? Shut up! Mr. Bai has just invited me to dinner. Come on, get in. Where are we going? "Ether". Surprise for me? Great! Hey! But it looks like you are taking me for a picnic. What picnic? We're really going up to the "Ether". Wow! Your private plane. The restaurant must be very far from here. We have to fly over there! Going to the restaurant? Go to hell! I'm going to be a superstar this time. Hey... hey... hey. Not the front seat. Take the rear one. Oh! This will be the headlines on tomorrow's newspapers all over China. Sit still, watch your head. I'm closing the window. What a romantic beginning! I wonder what will come next. Oh, it just takes my breath away! Certainly, it will. Oh, it's flying. This little plane is quite neat. Hey, where are you going to take me? Why do you have to follow me all the time? I like to. I'd love to learn every little thing about you. So how much do you know about me? Well, I can tell you're not a decent man. Hey, you are so close to the director, why don't you ask him to give me a more important role? I'm only an extra. What misery! I am like a page! So you want to be the lead? Of course, I would love to. Well, read a few lines to me. Sure. Now, listen. "If you don't give me a lot of money, I'll unveil your secret". Hey, what do you think about that? What have you dropped? Let me give you a hand. Oh! A prop pistol. What do you want this for? Oh! YunFei! YunFei! Help me out of here. YunFei, where are you going? YunFei! YunFei... YunFei. YunFei! Isn't that the Boss's plane? Something's wrong! Come on. Let's go and take a look. Hurry. Hon Tong... Hon Tong! Hon Tong! Oh my god! A ghost! Don't come any closer. Stay away from me. Hon Tong, don't be afraid. It's me. Stay away from me. Who the hell are you? I'm Mong Tian Fong. Don't you remember me? Who's Mong Tian Fong? I don't know you. Stay away from me. Didn't you die? Nonsense. Who's dead? You madman! Am I dreaming? You idiot. What the hell are you talking about? I still remember His Majesty had sentenced you to die by fire. What? What majesty? His Majesty, the First Emperor. The First Emperor? Ah, the First Emperor of China? You know him? Yes, the First Emperor. My duty is to guard His Majesty's Imperial Mausoleum. Then you must know Lady Mong. Lady what? Lady Mong, and also Xiol and Consort Yang. They are all famous beauties in history. I don't know them. All I care about is you. Oh! But you must know YunFei. No. Then how about Judge Pao? No. Hey, hey, let me see... You must know about Kim Keo. He is a parricide. He doesn't deserve mentioning. No, he is a real hero. He tried to assassinate the First Emperor. The parricide has already been beheaded. Beheaded? Hon Tong. Oh dear! Don't point it at me, don't point it at me. Give it to me. Give it to me, please. Please. Go away. Hon Tong. Hon Tong! Oh... A ghost! A zombie! Hon Tong! Help! Hon Tong. Hon Tong. The plane has crashed. Come on, let's go down and have a look. Ah... My God, stay away from me. Get off. Hey, what are you kneeling here for? You wanna scare the hell out of me? Hey, did you hear me? His Majesty has passed away. So what! He has already been dead for ages. I don't want to be here. Take me out of this goddamned place, please. His Majesty has passed away. Oh, my goodnes. Don't you know we're a Republic now? He has already been dead for almost 3000 years. Oh, someone is coming. 3000 years... Hon Tong, Hon Tong. The plane is here but where is the Boss? Somebody help me. Help! Where is the Boss? Take me out of here. There is a monster inside. What monster? Tie her up. Go inside and have a look. What are you doing to me? Take the back seat. Hon Tong, don't be afraid. I'm here. Everything will be fine. Let's get moving. Where are we going? I can't manage it. How can we go? Hey, have you been scared stupid? We are safe now. It's too bright. I can't open my eyes. What? You're so troublesome. Here, put these on. Take a look at yourself. Your face is so dirty. Go and wash it. What are you mooning there for? Hurry up! What are you mooning there for? Hurry up! Come on, let me carry you. Come on, let me carry you. Oh! You are still bleeding. I am terribly sorry. I'll get you a doctor as soon as we are in town. I'll get you a doctor as soon as we are in town. It's alright. It doesn't hurt. Look! Isn't it beautiful here? Yes. But what kind of trees are these? How come they are bare? They're not trees. They're lamp-posts. Mmm, you're so good to me. I'm not so afraid of you now. You don't seem like a bad guy. Do you want to know how old you are now? How long has it been since Qin Dynasty? Let me see. Tang, Sung, Yuan, Ming, Ching... I couldn't get the exact figures. If you were really from Qin Dynasty you would probably be about 3000 years old. Hey, where are they going? They must be going there to repair the Great Wall. Oh, I see. So the construction of the Great Wall has not been completed yet. Come on, let's go. Where are we going? Come on, I'm taking you to see a doctor. Hey, just stop there. OK! Here we are. Go on. Damn! Here. Take it back. This way, come on. Hurry. What secret weapon is this? Help me, please! I don't want it, I don't want it, I don't want surgery. No, no... We are in deep trouble. This must be a butcher inn. What nonsense are you saying? Why did you steal this syringe? Did you see the doctor? That's him. Why are you upsetting the hospital? A small-time actor. Take off your clothes for a check up. Hey! Who's the small-time actor? Open up your eyes. I'm a big movie star. Who do you think you are? You'd better hurry. We still have to rush back for the filming. We have taken this out of the mausoleum. It's an antique. Antique? I can't tell, the boss will have a look at it. Here comes the boss. Boss, that man is weird. He fights like an ancient knight. Damn it! You're all fools. Why didn't you tell me earlier? Where is that weird man now? Don't you mention this to anyone else. Hurry, go and find that man. Yes, boss. Boss, we have lost a lot this time. I'm afraid we have to recruit more men. It's getting really strange now. That weird man is dressed in an ancient way. I bet he knows a lot more about the secrets of the mausoleum than we do. Director, everything's set. We can start filming now. Right here. Stop! Damn! Haven't you got eyes? Tell me quick, where is Bai YnuFei? For the future of our country, I have to go. Cousin, don't go. Come back. Cousin. Boss, what are you going to do? Carry on. Don't stop. We should recruit more men and get more ammunition. We can't let them pre-empt us. Should we stop filming and concentrate on tracing the secret of the mausoleum? Carry on. Hey, look... Why is she coming back? That one behind her must be the weird man of the mausoleum. Get out of my way! Hey, what are you up to? Cousin, cousin... Bai YunFei, how heartless you are! You've almost killed me. You'd better explain everything to me. Lily, Lily, what's wrong with you? Why do you have to spoil my acting all the time? Who do you think you are? Bullshit! Director, if she wants to be the lead, let her do it. I quit. Miss Yuan, please don't go. Don't think you can get away with it like this! You slut! Director, I'm ready. You... Good! Director, I can still do a much better one. Good, carry on. Don't stop! I'll let you be the lead. Do you feel better now? The female lead? Why are you scoundrels molesting Hon Tong? You are going to pay for this! Who the hell are you? Chamberlain Mong, successor of the Mong's sword. Hahaha... Successor of the Mong's sword. What are you doing? What are you rioting here for? Are you alright? Stay out of this! OK. You're asking for it. You really want a duel because of me? Alright then, go ahead if you want to, but don't take it too serious. Ah! They are not joking! Oh, stop it! Stop fighting! You're gonna kill somebody. Stop fighting! Stop! Stop! Hon Tong, are you hurt? You monster! Don't you see that it is not your emperor's mausoleum? This is our filming location. Don't you see that? See what you've done to me. What mausoleum? What's all this rant about the mausoleum? Is it that place I got into after the plane crash. I almost got killed in there. It is so horrible in there. Oh! So you're the one they talked about. I'm sorry for what has happened. Well, we are friends now. Would you join our dinner tonight, a small welcome party. What are you doing? Oh! Sorry. I didn't know she was your sweetheart. Oh! Sorry. I didn't know she was your sweetheart. Please! You should be nice to our guest. I have the car ready for you two. Please be ready. Come on. Get in. Hey, put your head down. Why do you keep calling me Hon Tong? Who is she? She is my wife. Huh! So you take me for your wife! Give it back to me! Honey, I'm coming. Why don't you stay with him? Are you kidding? I'm not going to stay with him in the car. Let's go. Follow us. Come on. Be quick! He is really crazy about you. Oh, not really... Why does he keep saying that you're his Hon Tong? I guess, mabye his ex-wife was called Hon Tong. And I look like her. Perhaps she is even as pretty as I. Lily, do you think you can keep him stuck with you? That's easy! He has been following me all the time since we first met in the mausoleum. I can't think of any way to get rid of him. Good! Then you can take good care of him for me. Take care of him? Right! Let me out! Let me out! Stop screaming! Can't you see we've got a flat tire? Speed up! He's coming... Be quick. Hey, you. What the hell are you standing in the middle of the road for? Get lost! Get lost! Go away! Who are you? You wanna catch attention with these weird clothes? Can't you see we are all in a hurry? Get lost! Ah, you're real strong. Now watch out! Don't you know me? I am the Mayor's brother. You... Ouch! My hair... Hey, he is up there. Lily. When that swordman arrives, take him to your room first. Why? Remember! Don't let anyone take any snaps. Also, try to get a hair from him. What do you want his hair for? I just need it. Oh! What speed! You've just broken the record. Here is your Hon Tong. I'll give her back to you in one piece. See you later. What are you talking about? Do you guys want some shots? Come over here, please. Thank you. I don't care who you are and where you come from. I, the black sorcerer, must be the master of all swordmen. Who are you? The black sorcerer?! Nonsense. How dare you! You evil black sorcerer. I, Mong Tian Fong, am waiting for you right here. Come out and fight! You'd better obey me... Otherwise, I will torture you to death. What nonsense. If you have guts, come out and have a fight. You've got a big mouth! If you want a fight, come into my cave. If you are corageous enough, come into my cave. If you are corageous enough, come into my cave. Oh! My God. Let me help you get him out. Come on, you coward. Come out and fight. Don't go away. Can't you hear me? Don't go... He is afraid of you. He is gone. Come and rest. Oh! Your hair is in a mess. Let me comb it out for you. Hon Tong, we shouldn't have done this. His Majesty would never let us live together. We will never get away with this. Do you still remember the last time you combed my hair? Ah! Did I? You've forgotten everything? This pair of shoes belongs to you. Really, they're mine? How come everything has changed so much after I woke up? I really don't understand what has happened to me! Oh! I've got to go out for a while. I'll explain everything to you later. Now, just be patient. Sit here and wait for me. Hon Tong. Just sit here. I'll come back and dress you up properly. I'll be back soon. Hon Tong, don't leave me alone. I'll be right back, don't worry. Crazy man. What a delicate pair of shoes! They're made of silk. We couldn't afford to buy any shoes. And this is my first pair. I treasure them too much to wear them. She has forgotten everything... Is that right? Terrific! Thank you. The Armour piece and the hair you got from him. We've conducted the Carbon 14 test on them. It is proven that the armour is an antique of almost 3000 years. Also, the cells of the hair are of the same age as the armour. This is really strange. That means the man must be at least 3000 years old. Then this man is really a living treasure. If we send him to the Northwest Laboratory to dissect him, or cremate him, we can probably find out the secrets of longevity from him. But I have to see this man first. And you'll have the money after this man has arrived in the Northwest safely. Is that fine with you? Is that fine with you? Mr. Bai, a lady has come to see you. Excuse me. Please. Mister, is that alright? Mister. That is a menu. You can order something to eat. For me to eat? I dont' feel like eating. Waiter, we'll have three and that's all. Cheers. Cheers. Mr. Mong, when did your Majesty, the first emperor, die of sickness? I'm the living example of the success of the elixir. His Majesty must have taken it, so how could His Majesty die? Exactly. I don't think I am the only one who survived. So I've got to hurry back to His Majesty's mausoleum to find them. Fine! I'll arrange everything for you. Mr. Mong. Can you tell us something about the building of the mausoleum? I'll tell you more about modern life. Mr. Bai, your phone call. Excuse me. That's the man we'll deal with on the train. Alright? What's going on here? Didn't the director say we are going to shoot the film today? But how come we are leaving? Where the hell are we going? I have to go and talk to him. I have to go and talk to him. Come on. Come on, you two. Hurry up. Go ahead. We are coming. Mr. Mong, don't fret. This is the ironhorse, we call it a train. It's a lot faster than your horses. It can take you back to your mausoleum in a day's time. Let's go. Mr. Bai, I'm deeply indebted to you for helping me back to the mausoleum. Thank you very much. It's my pleasure. Our future super star, would you please take care of our guest for me? I promise you will be the lead of my next film. Did women in the ancient times eat and wear high heels? And what did they usually talk about when they were in love? You have a good harvest this time as I get you this priceless living treasure. Mr. Bai, I know you still have something hidden from me. Such as the location of the mausoleum. We still don't have any ideas where that is. We'll work harder on that. Trust me, we are good partners. Alright? Bai YunFei, your underlings have betrayed you. Huh! The cat is out of the bag. Huh! The cat is out of the bag. Let's go to the mausoleum. How incredible it is that I've slept for 3000 years. Thank you. Director. Bai YunFei, explain all this to me. You have forgotten everything, yet I still remember it perfectly. Mabye this is a punishment from heaven. Don't be upset. I promise I'll be serious from now on. I'll listen to every word of your recollection. Don't be cross. Tell me from the beginning. Why? Why do you have to do this to me? You have never trusted me. I am not your Hon Tong. Why should I trust you? Where are you taking me to? The Mausoleum is in the west but the train is heading for the east. Let me go! Let me go! Tell me! Where? I don't know! It's Bai YunFei's idea. You betrayed me! Why? Ahh! Open the door! Wait for me! How much the Great Wall has changed! Everything is over now. And you're not my Hon Tong. There is nothing left for me here... Take care! Where are you going? I'm going back to the mausoleum. That's where I belong. I am nobody in the film industry. Everyone looks down on me. You're the only one who cares for me. I don't care wether I am your Hon Tong. I only want to be with you always. Hon Tong, Hon Tong. Boss, there you are... Take as much as you can. Everything here is priceless, so be careful. It's a dead end. Dead end? There must be rooms behind the wall. Blow it up! Give me the dynamite. Hurry! Be careful! You looters! Get out of this place! Get out... Hon Tong. Fire! Boss, don't go... Oh! My hat! Hon Tong! Watch out! Save the boss. Hurry, dig harder! Where are we? This is the end of the mausoleum. Oh! The oxygen is running out. You must know the way out. I don't know. I only know it's my duty to guard His Majesty's mausoleum forever I couldn't die here... I won't die. You people care so much about death. What can you do even if you have eternal life? Look at our empire. It was so glorious in my time. So what! It just turned to ashes. Tian Fong, a life is still a life. If there is a way out, why should we have to die? What does everyone want with an eternal life? Take me as an example. I can live forever, yet I didn't know what was going on outside. That's the real horror. Bai YunFei, you're responsible for all this trouble. Do you think I want to die? You killed and robbed the mausoleum. This is an unpardonable crime. I don't care. These days we cannot rely on anybody else but ourselves. If you want to do something great, money has to come first. Without money, you're just a crock of shit. Understand?! Don't you understand?! The both of you have the same ambition? No, Tian Fong, not for me. I just want to live. To live with you. I don't want to die. I want to be out of here with you. Tian Fong... Tian Fong! Tian Fong. Incredible! There are so many terra-cotta warriors here guarding the Imperial Mausoleum. I am going to be a millionaire. Hahaha... All these antiqueues! They are all priceless. I am rich. I am rich. I am rich! I am rich! I am rich! I am the first man who has ever entered the Royal Chamber in history! Your Majesty. Mong Tian Fong, all these treasures belong to me. Once you trespass in the Imperial Mausoleum, you cannot get out of here. What the hell is it! An earthquake! How come we are moving up? An earthquake! Tian Fong. Tian Fong, why is it moving upwards? Isn't this the airport? We are back on the ground, aren't we? Hey, the airplane. Where did these heavenly warriors come from? How incredible! Fire! All of you, stay back. Fire! Fire! Don't fire... Don't... Tian Fong. Stand still... Tian Fong... Hon Tong! Hon Tong! Sit down! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Hon Tong! Hon Tong! Hon Tong! Hon Tong! Now, at least, I can feel that I am your Hon Tong... You'll always be my Hon Tong. But, I understand it only too late. Promise me you'll wait for me. I'll be back... I promise I'll definately wait for you. Nineteen Nineties Here we are. Dokuru-san. Everyone, please follow me! Yes, yes. Yes! Everyone follow me This is the first chamber of the First Emperor's Mausoleum. It was discovered in March 1974. It's the eighth wonder of the world and it was opened for the public in 1979. The Terra-Cotta warriors symbolize the Emperor's power. The Great Wall and this Terra-Cotta army marks the high point of the Qin-dynasty. The mausoleum is so large that they are still continuing to excavate it.
