She fell for the sports star, and he gave her a luxury life. They were a beautiful couple. He is wanted for murder in L.A. He is wanted in Mississippi. He is wanted in Louisiana for murder. The horrifying murder is meant to be committed by the Casanova assassin. The police are asking everyone to be watching out and contact them, - - if you have information that can lead to the serial killer's arrest. There we have the birth attendant. - What are you doing? - Nothing. - Well, isn't this fantastic? - It's too much, Kris. No, then. I have my little helpers. Faye stood for the invitations. Your delicious boytoy — servant provided the restaurant. I just dressed up. - Thanks, Ron! - Stop it. We are just friends. I think you should take him home and get a good hold of those balls - - and then just give it gas. - Hi. - Excuse me for interrupting. I just wanted to say congratulations. Were you surprised? Also to that extent. Kris, I think you need to get over this and standing and joking in the spinach. And now no trouble with you. Okay? Because she's mine. Well, you liked that. I'm sorry. She becomes a little too much when she's drunk. It's your evening. Just get rid of it, and tell if you are missing something. Thanks, Ron. "Tell me if you're missing something." Don't understand the concept "just good friends"? - That's what all cougars call their chops. - Cougars? Come talk to me. Tell me how you feel. Now, do not lie that you are fine. How are you really? I feel stronger than long. It goes good with my therapy. I feel there are big breakthroughs. That is it nice to hear. I have promised myself that I will not let myself walk on him any longer. No matter how often he calls or sneaking around in the bushes. - Is he still suffering from bush syndrome? - His footsteps are always in my garden. Size 43 from Brunos. I bought them myself. I am crazy about the new, independent Nicole. You got divorced two years ago. You may want to move on. I would like that too, Kris. But will he ever allow me do that? What do you mean? I'm afraid he will murder me one day. And he will get away with it. Godfather, Nicole! What are you talking about? Hello! Did you forget, that the party is going on out here? - And after the sour shock ... - Sure? - Don't say you're going already. - Don't say you're going already. Kris! Have a fun evening. Forget about all the dark thoughts, and get her there in a taxi. I'll do that. I have to say hello from Bruce. He's the host for a fundraiser with Heidi Krieger. - No, how mad. - I'm the manager of all time. Have fun, girls! Come on, kids. We're going home now. The children are dead tired. And if I don't get Faye home, You hang on her all night. - Should I drive you home? - No, my car is here. But a thousand thanks for the party. It was so sweet of you. - Everything for you. - Thanks, Ron. Take good care of yourself. - Faye! - Come on! Bye Bye. Sugar Shock. - Come on, Justin. - Uh, how cold is that. Sydney, come here, honey. Did you behave nicely. Did you have fun? It's a cold evening, huh  --- Nicole, wait now. Nicole! - God damn. - Is it him? Call the police. I can't. Do you think they'll do anything? He owns the town with half of the city's officers. Come here, honey. No, not to me. Your fiance probably thinks also you shouldn't. I shit on what he thinks. Lie down, Kato. Don't let that pig get yourself down by the neck. He is far down and will tear down everyone else. I just want to be a good mother. Just like my mother was for me and my sisters. That's the most important thing now. As soon as I take a small step forward, he comes and slows me down. I'm sorry. You come out the other side. - What was it? - It was probably just a tree. - I'm just checking. - It was nothing. Fuck it. Fuck him! Fuck you! Come on, now we're giving him a show. - I can't tonight. Sorry. - I thought you liked it. I could too. I can. Maybe another time, right? Okay. I'm going home. I also have to get up early tomorrow. Julia Roberts needs a new interior designer. So who eats breakfast beside her at The Chateau? - You're not running from my decor. - No, I promise. Well. May 21, 1994 We came under one. See you tomorrow? 14.5 kilometers at nine. You're a slave whip. Hi, Ron. Can I help with anything? Hey. Good morning. I wanted to see if Candace was home. She hasn't run for a few days. She lives in a hotel, while I am painting her house. In fact, I am too to refurbish. My friend would imagine standing for that, but she's a little unstable. I have the paint and everything is lacking of a craftsmanship. Right now Brentwood will give half the house a facelift. Brentwood is not enough to give the houses a facelift. Now I'm just trying my luck. You shouldn't have time, do you? Yes maybe. It is 315 square meters. Four bedrooms, four bathrooms. A kitchen and an office. - Are these your children? - Yes. They are with my parents, while I'm trying to get the house done. We moved in for half a year ago, but it's a bit stumped. - I didn't get your name. - Glen. - Just Glen? - Yup. Just Glen, my name is Nicole Brown. Nicole Brown ... Simpson! Just Brown. I'm divorced. Look around a bit. I'm sorry. - You want a glass? It's healthy. - Yes please. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Were you thirsty? - Very. Thanks. - What do you think? - About the juice? - About the assignment. - It'll take me three to four days. - That's the pearl. - I haven't heard that expression for a long time. Where are you from? Around. Just Glen from Around, when can you get started? Immediately? May 24, 1994 How are you today, Nicole? I don't know. As I'm usually doing, I think. I feel anxious. Lately we talked about asking for help from your family. I don't had good time opening myself to them. Because they didn't support you, when you got divorced? O.J. did a lot for them through the years. That's how he manipulated them. He makes people dependent on him. He must be the hero for both, on and off the field. How about you, Nicole? How do you feel about him? I haven't been with any other man since I was 18. My friends said he was shaping me, the way he wanted me, - so no one else could take his place. And to be honest I'm sometimes missing to have sex. But I don't miss his control over me. He decided what I was wearing, what I was eating - - whom I became friends with. And for God's sake no men. But he bowled every single woman on his way. Do you think he loved you? I thought that, back in the past. But I don't do that any longer. Now I think, he was looking at me as a thing, - which he could control and own. It's not love, is it? Kato? Damn. tax returns Keep your mouth shut! I know, it was you. What do you want? I beg you. I will not call the police again. For the last time:Let me be! May 25, 1994 - Good morning. Shall we take a walk? - Sorry, but I can't today. - Everything is alright? - Yes. - Such. Now you don't get burglarized again. - Thanks, Walter. Burglarized? Nicole, what the hell is going on? - Nothing. - It's him again, right? - Ron, not now. - I can see it on you. - Tell me what's going on. - Ron, please don't. My life ... It's all complicated right now. I will do it, that is best for me and the children. You're a sweet guy, and it is sweet of you to worry. But it's the best, you don't interfere. He has done some far-out stuff, - who doesn't that, you can't trust anyone. But you have people in your life, - that are looking in your eyes and care about you. Don't push us away. Glen? The alarm stops, as soon as you close the open door. Should I get into all that? It's thick as a phone book. They want it, to look complicated. These lamps show, that the house is safe. If you want to turn it on at night, enter a four-digit code. You choose the four numbers yourself. It's that easy. Hold it for ten seconds, then the alarm sounds, even with the police. - Now, I've got it. - Then enter your code. Now you have control over it. - That was the pearl. - The apple. - You've come a long way. - Yes. I'll be done this afternoon. Then you have to come for me. You have the knuckle. Don't you need a break? - Where have I stored them now? - Has anything gone? Voila. - Why are you hiding them? - My ex was always after me. He said it was an ugly habit. So I got myself a secret warehouse. Fortunately, he is not here anymore. You can do whatever you want. You don't have to save anything. Over the years, I've probably learned to store them for safety. It's hard to believe - - that a strong woman like you is thinking like that. - I'm not very strong. - Yes. Don't save yourself. You are fine on your own. You've done well. I pay ... Only when the task is done. - Hi! - Where in the world have you been? I was skiing worried! Why didn't you answer me? I have answered you later. I have my beeper in my bag. - I promised to finish it. - Faye ... There is probably because I have been busy. I haven't said otherwise, I'd do it. What was I supposed to do? You disappeared. My kids need a home. You have only one life? I have been busy. Sorry. It's not good so far right now, Faye. You'd better go. I said, I would come back. Now I am here. And then you throw me out? Is there any other one? You see ... I don't want you here in that state. - There's someone here. - I don't know what you're talking about. Listen, Faye. Now listen to what I'm saying. - You must leave. - Why? Come here. - You're completely out of control! - Don't you want me? - You look like a zombie. - Who's here? Who gets your famous warm welcome? Godfather! Is he up there? - Faye, don't worry. - Uh, don't. Typical You just jumping in the can with him again. You just don't. Has he changed again? You went into his trap again, because you are so fucking stupid. You are. I love you, - - but you first listen, before it's too late. You don't listen to your friends. That man will be your death. Do not come and say I didn't warn you. Bye Bye. I am leaving now! Oh God. No, John. She'll wake up. Damn! I will not do it. I will not do it. Leave me alone! I don't want to be here. I will not do it. Fuck! No! No! Charlie, you said, that it was the last time. And now ... Let me be in peace. Why don't you let me be? - Charlie? No. No no. - Glen? Hi, Nicole. Listen up ... Nicole? Nicole, listen here. Nicole? I don't know, what went by me. It was ... It was stupid, right? I didn't mean it. Nicole, let's talk about it now. We can talk about that. Your mark! Then close it up! I'll kill you with the power! Shut up, damn it! Stupid sack! Then close it up! - They have hired him for restoration? - Yes, as a painter. - May we ask for his name? - His name is Glen. - And the last name? - Just Glen. I don't know. Do you have an address? A phone number? Paging? Do you tend to dress like this, when you have labors? What does this have to do with the case? How did you pay him? With credit card or check? Cash. - Mrs. Simpson ... - Brown. It's not the first time, They call us. - What are you trying to say? - They even invited him inside. - You do not mean with that?! - They often call from the alarm center. You mean, that this "shit's" over to Rockingham forces for me. When he will murder me, you must believe that you would never help me. After all, he's just one of the guys. We then shoot at wives and boyfriends, which tea gets dry. Ms. Brown. What they do in your spare time, I don't come with. But for the sake of your children you should take it under control. Keep doors and windows closed. And tell us, if him Glen reappears. JUNE 10, 1994 Isn't it just me? - It would dress you crazy good. - It's the children's day today. The mothers must, have some fun too. She wants to ask for what I give. - It is too much. - Wow. Get to  Argento at 7:00    You have to hang out with aunt Kris. Behave well. I'll pick you up. I love you. See you soon. - Thanks. - Hi, hi, Mom. - Then we can be together all day. - Okay, kids, come along. - Sorry, is Candace at home? - No, I'm her brother. - Can I help with anything? - I'm her neighbor. When is she back? I must talk to her about her painter. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Glen. I met him right here. I can not help you. We are afraid something has happened to her. What are you talking about? MISSING CANDACE JORGENSEN If you hear from her, then ask her to call back. Hi, Charlie. Thank you very much for taking the kids. I owe you a favour. The woman's identity being detained ... I'll do that. Well. Good night. ... in a normal one peaceful park in Brentwood, - - where her family reported her missing. There are no suspects. The killer presumed to be free. Hello. - You said it was the last time. - Hello? I can't ... I don't want to listen to that. No, Charlie. I'll kill you with the power! - Nicole? - Yes. Where do the bruises come from? I know what you're thinking. But this time it wasn't O.J. I've met another man here recently. A craftsman, I was hired for the house. But you ended up in bed together. I don't know what I was up to. Maybe I was frustrated. Maybe it was to defy O.J. But I realized right away, that it was a bad mistake. Later that evening he stood in my living room - - and talked to someone, which was not there at all. When I looked him in the eyes, he looked insane. She tried to assault me. I ran upstairs and locked me in the bedroom. He hammered on the door and said, that he would kill me. Ever since, he appears, wherever I go. It's as if he's haunting me. And then last night ... I can't describe it at all. I have experienced something, I have never experienced in my life. It felt like I was in Hell and back again. I say to myself, that it was just a nightmare. But that doesn't explain it the fucking bruises. I don't think Hell exists. But it represents all that, we fear and oppress. All the negative things in our past. I don't know who that man was. But he should remind you that you must take control of your life. How would you like it if your ex-husband or another man - - not anymore, anyone has power over you? If you just said stop, finally, and you really meant it? JUNE 12, 1994 - Do you have your tights? - Yes. - Come on mom. We'll be late. - Come on! Get out in the car. I'll be there in a moment. TAXES VISION See you at Mezzaluna. I've booked a table for ten. - We're running after you. - Okay. Come honey. Then we drive to the restaurant. Oops, sorry. On with the harnesses. I want to see the kids, before going to Chicago. Do not use the children to access to me. You're not a father. Isn't it enough that you shadow me, breaking in and calling in the middle of the night? Now you should too cleaning up the treasure trove on me? Will they take the house from me? I paid it myself. Must your children and me end on the street? Is the plan so, I crawl back to you? I warned you, that I'll screw the bit on now. Let me cut it out in cardboard. You are no longer a member of the family. Is that understood? You can no longer threaten, manipulate or scare me. Our marriage is dead. You're dead for me. Don't fucking touch me, again! Look for you, man. Charlie? What's going on, sweetie? I know I have asked many services, but may I ask for one more? Of course. Anything. Promise me that if something happens to me, then you take care of my children. What is this about? Now you make me scared. Don't, I just want you to promise it? No one is allowed to hurt you or your children. Don't you want to go home with us tonight? Then we have a pajamas party. The kids will love it. And it's best that you're not alone. Kris, you just are my world's best friend. But I have to learn dealing with my problems myself. We'll have to make it home. - Okay. I understand that. - Thanks. I'm always here for you. - I love you. - I love you too. - You're like family. - Thanks. Sydney, bring your brother. Goodbye. Good night. Nicole! - Mom looks after you. - Do you promise? I promise. - Will you sing my best song for me? - Yes. calm down little you now that the clock is many fall asleep in your bed little girl little boy How, it wasn't so good then. I think it's Nicole's mother. - Not a bad excuse. - I'd better have a look. I'm here right here and I look after you - Fuck, he's here. - Who? Your boyfriend's husband. He looks pissy. Rather, keep a low profile,male. in peace during the game of angels you can sleep in peace during the game of angels - Mother? - Yes honey? - Sleep in here tonight. - Not tonight, little honey. - You mustn't go. - I'm not going anywhere. Good night. Sleep well. - I love you. - I love you too honey. Police have now widespread the search for the suspect - - for two recent female murders here in Southern California.
