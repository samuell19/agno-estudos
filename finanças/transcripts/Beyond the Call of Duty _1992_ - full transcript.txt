Listen up. There's no more choppers at the airport. Now get us out of here. You guys make sure you look around. You don't leave nothing for Charlie, okay? (subdued music) (people chattering) (speaking foreign language) (suspenseful music) (man grunts) (man laughing) (man grunts) (people chattering) (gun firing) (dramatic music) (yells) (speaking foreign language) - Come on! (guns firing) Move, move, move! (speaking foreign language) (explosion booms) (gun firing) (guns firing) (speaking foreign language) (guns firing) (explosions booming) - Jimmy T! Come on! Go, go, go, go! (speaking foreign language) - Gonzo, you all set with the code books? - Yeah. Let's get this stuff down to Mr. Henderson. Help me with this stuff. Let's go. - This makes a man sicker than shit. That the last of it, Gonzo? - Almost, Chief. - You still pulling out at 18:00, Mr. Henderson? - If Ben has set the charges by then, we're out of here. - Go fetch the rest, Gonzo. - Aye-aye, Chief. - Thomas, if I find anything readable in there when it's done, it's your ass. - Aye-aye, Chief. - I don't know. I was getting to like it here. Goddamn it. - Well, let's just make sure we're not the last two to die in this hell hole, okay? - [Chief] Aye-aye to that, Sam. (tense music) - I lost my glasses. - Hey, come on, you guys! Let's go! - I wanna go home. - Come on, come on. - Did you check him? (explosion booms) - [Soldier] What the? What are they doing? - Come on! Come back! Come back! (tense music) (woman crying) (speaking foreign language) (man yelling) (explosions booming) (guns firing) - [Soldier] Incoming! (explosions booming) You mothers! (men shouting) (guns firing) (explosions booming) - [Soldier] I need a stretcher! (guns firing) - Three-five, Binh. Give me Three-Five. - Come in. Come in Three-Five. Come in. (explosions booming) (man yelling) - Where's our goddamn air cover? (guns firing) - That's it! Hey, pull back! Pull back! (men shouting) - [Soldier] Fall back! Start getting down! Get under cover! - Tango Victor Three-Five, this is Bravo Three-Seven. Come in Three-Five. Come in. - Go ahead, Three-Seven. This is Three-Five. - I need a medevac, Three-Five. And where the hell's my air cover? - Request temporarily denied, Three-Seven. No can do. - Three-Five, this is Holland. I've got wounded up here and I can't hang on much longer. You're gonna have to pack up 40 more body bags if I don't get some help up here and now. - [Soldier] Zebra One, this is Alpha Tango. We've been overrun. I repeat, we've been overrun. The enemy's taken over the village. - [Soldier] Move it, damn it! I said, move it, soldier! - I don't need this shit. - [Soldier] Let's go! Get the lead out, damn it! - I don't need this shit! (helicopter blades whirring) - In my estimation, now's the time to finish 'em off, but my hands are ties on this one. A Company from 101st Armored Division's on the move and we're gonna have to move way faster than this, Captain. VC have taken the city of Wet. They took the radio station and they blasted the Presidential Palace. Counting on you to get Bravo Company out of here. Let's go, Captain. Good luck. Let's get moving. - Their defenses are in shambles. Their morale, broken. Very soon the South will fall. (men cheering) - [Soldier] To victory! - Are we ready to march through Saigon? (men cheering) - [Soldier] Bash anybody who stands in your way! To victory! (subdued music) (horn honks) (people chattering) (horn honking) - Come on, you guys. Move it! Let's go! I know if this captain's gonna wait for us. - I know. - Come on! - But I don't think they'll wait for us. - They better wait for us. Otherwise, I don't know how the hell we're gonna get out of here and up to Saigon. (horn honks) (siren wailing) (people chattering) (horn honking) - [Soldier] Stop! Stop! - What's going on? - [Soldier] The road is closed. You cannot pass this way. - [Woman] Fuck! - Where are we going? - Just keep going straight. We've gotta get to HQ to find Len. - HQ? - Yeah, maybe he can help us. - Okay. - Could you just move? Can't you go faster? (horn honking) Back it up! Move it! Can't you back it up? I mean, just move! What are doing? Get away! No, get away! Let's go! Stop it! What are they doing? Just stop! Move, move! Just stop it! Get your hand out of the window! - [Man] We've gotta get out of here. - Leave us alone! We're not doing anything! Stop! - Come on. Come with me. Come on! (speaking foreign language) (people shouting) Come on, this way. Come on. Hurry, hurry! Go! Inside, inside! (banging on door) - Children, go to your rooms. (wolf whistles) - Hey, baby. How about some action? - Welcome to the Church of Our Lady of Lord. - Thank you. He's a... He's a pretty smooth talker. - Mickey picked up quite a lot from his mother's clientele. Are you a photographer? - No. Actually, I'm down here shooting a documentary on Len Jordan. Now we're just hoping he can help us get out. But first, we have to get up to HQ. - God works in mysterious ways. I believe we can help each other. - Let's go home, boys. Let's head due south. Let's move. Let's go! (subdued music) - Five, four, three, two. (explosions booming) - 7th Fleet for you, Sam. - Jehovah, this is Able Team. - [Man On Radio] Able Team, this is Jehovah. You are instructed to go back to Soc Trang to pick up Len Jordan. Repeat, pick up Len Jordan. - Roger. We've gotta turn around and go get Len Jordan out of Soc Trang. - Fuck. Let him grab a chopper. - He's bringing full dossiers of all the locals that helped us. - Can he hang on until we get there? - He's gonna have to. - I hope he has enough fuel up there. Fuck, we've got hardly enough gas and ammo as it is. - What the hell, Gonzo? We did come here to fight a war, right? - Fuck that hero shit. - Let's go get him. - All right. Probably take us a day to make it to sea. They're be a chopper there. Hopefully, the Navy will send a ship. Take us back to the real world. (speaking foreign language) (tense music) (engine sputtering) - [Man] Hello, GI. Hello. Hello, GI. Hello. (guns firing) - Shit! (men yell) (speaking foreign language) (explosions booming) - Spin it, Chief. (guns firing) (explosion booms) (explosion booms) - Let's hope your Len Jordan is a miracle worker. (kid crying) (explosions booming) (guns firing) (speaking foreign language) - There's Len. Follow him. (tense music) - Something's up ahead. - [Man] GI! GI! GI! - [Woman] Hello, GI. Hello. - Binh. (people shouting) - South China's about to fall! (explosion booms) (guns firing) (explosions booming) - Don't cry. It'll be all right. (speaking foreign language) (explosions booming) (kids screaming) (explosion booms) - We lost the other truck. (speaking foreign language) - [Sam] Jordan, it's a pleasure to meet you. - Yeah, you too, Henderson. - I thought there'd be more of you. - Had a little trouble with the trucks. (explosion booms) (kids screaming) - [Woman] Okay, get the kids. Get 'em, come on. - [Man] Okay, come on. - All right, kids. Come on. - Come on, come on. All right, let's go. Len! Len! - Mary. - I've got these Amaratian kids with me. - Yeah? - Their fathers are all in the States and you know how the Vietnamese feel about these kids. I mean, what do you think's gonna happen when the NVA takes over? - Well, Mary. - No, no, no, no. Wait, this is great. This is the ending to your story. I mean, just think about it. The last American to leave and he takes all these kids with him. - Oh, Mary, I'd really like to help. I really would, but. - It's okay. We can go ahead and take 'em with us. It's gonna slow us down a little bit. We'll have to move now, but it'll be okay. - Good. Who are you? - I'm Sam Henderson, the skipper. How you doing? - Mary. Fine. So, it's okay? - Come on, kids. Move out. (subdued music) (explosion booms) (kids scream) (dramatic music) (explosions booming) - [Binh] Come on. Hurry up. Inside. (dramatic music) (speaking foreign language) (tense music) (guns firing) (dramatic music) - Hey, you're gonna have to move. I can't see a thing. - Just another minute. The light's really good right now. (engine revs) Goddamn it! I told you I'd be just another minute. - Look, I am probably blowing my chance at immortality here, but we've got a job to do. It's called get the hell out of here and your career is not a high priority on my list. All right? - Hey. Why don't you just chill out? Stay out of his face. Go back and film the nun, and those kids, and stuff for a while. Okay? (dramatic music) What's going on here, Lieutenant? - We've gotta go back another way. - We gotta get the hell out of here right now. The fastest way is straight down the river. - Well, ordinarily I'd agree with you, but on the way back up here we ran across some NVA sampans. If they know we're around, they're probably waiting right around the corner for us. - You know, I'm still the senior officer here, son. - No. - What the hell you mean, no? - You're not the senior officer here. Look, Jordan. I know you've been doing a bang-up job around here, but you've gotta remember one thing. You're ex-military. The Comm 7th Fleet sent me back here to pick you up and I gotta get you out. If anything happens to you, they're gonna hang it on me. So, we're gonna do things my way, okay? - They're gonna hang your ass, Henderson. (explosion booms) - Off starboard! (explosion booms) - [Mary] Help me! (guns firing) (dramatic music) (kids crying) (explosions booming) (kids screaming) - Chief! Chief! - Yeah. - Check the port bow, quick. - Here you go. - How many, motherfuckers? You want me to puke? Turkey loaf or nothing. - Gonzales, why don't you go see if we have any turkey loaf? - We'll see. - You make me a movie star in Hollywood? - It's not for Hollywood. - You got cigarette? - [Mary] How old are you? - Old enough. I'm like seven. Too bad. - [Gonzales] Here. - Hey, good feature, huh? Hurry up. - So, you're name's Mickey. - Real name's Quang. Chase used to call me Mickey, like Mickey Mouse. - Do you know your father? - Ma say his name's Bill. He's come from Minnesota. - Maybe we can help you find him. - [Mickey] Minnesota is close to California? - [Mary] No. - Forget it. I want California, Hollywood, Disney Land. - Animals and kids, huh? - Yeah, there's one back there that can give Dennis the Menace a run for his money. Hey. Hey, you guys. You thirsty? Here's some water. Hey, Henderson. I'm gonna hand you my camera, but don't get it wet, okay? Lieutenant Henderson, what's your opinion of Len Jordan and his private war in the Mekong Delta? - I'm sorry, what's the question? - What is your opinion of Len Jordan and his private war in the Mekong Delta? - Uh. Well, I guess it takes a lot of guts to resign your commission and take on the war by yourself. A lot of people think that if the top brass would've listened to Len Jordan, South Vietnam would come out on top. - Um. I think something just bit me. - What? - There's a lot of these things. - Probably leeches. - Leeches? Can't you just be careful? - Would you just hold still? We only have one more. Hold on. - They're the most God-awful things I've ever seen. - You're welcome. - Thanks. - I've gotta get back to work. - Hey. You better now, kiddo? Don't worry about it, Mary. I've seen real strong men come undone when they run into those things. - Well, it doesn't make me feel any less humiliated. - Aw, come on. Cheer up. - What's the matter? - It's a little public around here right now, you know? You know what I mean? - Yeah. I'll just wait till dark before attacking. - That's better. (tense music) I figure we ought to make pretty good time after it gets dark. Won't be able to tell us from the rest of the refugees. You know, I was thinking. About 10 clicks down this river, there's an old special ops cache we used to have. Got gas, ammo, guns. We ought to pull in there. - Sounds good. (tense music) (kids laughing) - Henderson. - Yeah. - We got a welcoming party up ahead. You listen to me. Drop me and the boys off down river. You go back, draw their fire, we'll come in from behind. - What makes you so sure? - Just a hunch. I know what the hell I'm talking about. - Okay, Chief. Take us in. (suspenseful music) (speaking foreign language) (explosion booms) (dramatic music) (guns firing) - Hold your fire! (guns firing) (grunting) (gun firing) (punches thudding) (guns firing) (soldier yells) (tense music) There he is. Okay, let's get out of here, Chief. (subdued music) - I was so worried about you. - (chuckles) I don't know why. I always land on my feet. - My camera was ruined. It doesn't matter. As long as you're okay. What's gonna happen to us? - What do you mean? - We've meant so much to each other. I just don't want it to end. - It doesn't have to, honey. I'll be back with the wife and kids, I'm sure. But when I come to Los Angeles, will you still be there for me? - That's all? - Mary, you know I'm a family man. - So, I'm not good enough for your image, huh? - Baby, don't. (kids chattering) Well, there you go. 5,000 rounds of 50 caliber ammo. There's five grand more back there. - The way we went through all the ammo getting here, I figured if we got into another firefight, we'd be history. (speaking foreign language) (tense music) - Hi. - Hey, Sam. What do you think about this? - I like it. All right, grab what you can. Let's get out of here. Come on. Now. - What the hell do you think you're doing going around scaring? - You're making too much noise in the jungle. I could've been Charlie. - But you really just like showing my mistakes, don't you? - It's kind of fun. - I can't do anything. I can't steer a boat, I can't shoot a gun. Without my camera, I can't even record this damn thing. - Look, in wartime, people have a habit of rising to the occasion. But do what you have to do and you'll do it well. - Lieutenant, what... Could you tell me what you really think of Len Jordan? - My name is Sam. And you can forget the lieutenant stuff because I'm trying to get used to being a civilian again. - You're avoiding my question. - I know. (suspenseful music) - What the hell? I wasn't doing anything, turkey. - Hey, what the hell are you doing with these? - Nobody else wanted them. - You'll die of lung cancer before you're 30. - 30? It's a long way off. - Hey, you know something? It gets there a lot faster than you think. - Give back my Salems. - You believe this kid? Oh, what the hell. There's a war on. Here, but you only get one at a time. (tense music) - What's that? - You tell me and we'll both know. (gun firing) (dramatic music) - Sister, get the kids on the boat, now! Move, come on! Let's go! (guns firing) (explosion booms) (guns firing) (explosions booming) (speaking foreign language) - Mary, get to the boat. Go on, move. (gun firing) (explosion booms) (speaking foreign language) (explosion booms) (Mary grunts) I'll get her. (guns firing) Okay, move. (gun firing) (men yelling) - [Mary] Mickey! - Let's get the hell out of here! Come on! (speaking foreign language) (guns firing) (men yelling) (kids laughing) Hey. - Children, stop that. Come on, let's go. (tense music) - Can't wait till we hit those sea breezes. - I just hope the Navy hasn't pulled out. - How could they? I mean, especially since we have a war hero onboard. - Back home I don't think people give a damn about this war anymore. I've got a feeling the Navy brass feels the same way. Even about war heroes. - I... I really want them out. - I know. ♪ Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound ♪ - Hey, Gonzo, I saw a dog. A big dog. - Yeah, right. - You. - I remember, that was you. (both laughing) - Doggie. (laughs) ♪ I once was lost and now I'm found ♪ - [Mary] It's okay. Don't cry. Come on. (kid sobbing) ♪ Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound ♪ ♪ Who saved a wretch like me - Shh, it's okay. - [Chief] Oop, oop, that's this one. - Good to see 'em having fun, isn't it? - First time I've seen him have a good time since his kid died.

We're gonna have to pass under the Duling Bridge before we get out to the Delta. - That's the last choke point before they can bottle us up. - I reckon you can count on it. - Well, let's check it out. - We're gonna have to get in a little closer while we still have some light to see by. - I'll send a couple of my boys. - I don't know. We're gonna need a demolitions man. Gonzales, well, he's an expert in what we're gonna need. - Then do it. - All of the kids have marks on their arm. Big, big scars. Hey, you listen to me? I'm telling you a story. - Well, it's you and me in the barrel. (suspenseful music) What? - It's the kid. What the hell are you doing here? - Hey, Gonzo. Take me with you. - Are you crazy or something? Get On back to the boat. - Okay. Good luck, huh? - I'm coming back. I promise. Look, I have a present for you. But if I do make it back, you're gonna kick this habit for good. Is that a deal? - It's tough, but I'll do it. - [Gonzales] Good. - Gonzo. - Yeah? - You've got to quit, too. Deal? - Yeah. Yeah, that's a deal, kid. (tense music) - I've gotta get closer. You stay here. (speaking foreign language) (gasping) (dramatic music) (speaking foreign language) (grunting) (tense music) Move, Gonzo. - Mr. Henderson. - [Mickey] Gonzo, you're back. (Gonzales chuckles) - Hey, I told you I'd come back. - Mm-hmm. (both laugh) - Come on. - Yeah. - Henderson, your idea stinks. - You got a better idea? - Yeah. Go back up the river. Try and find another way out. - We'd just get more of the same. - I don't buy that. - It's not your decision to make, is it? Gonzo, charges ready? - All set, Sam. - Chief, you a good swimmer? - I'll go, Mr. Henderson. I was the best swimmer in my class, sir. - Okay. All right, Chief. I want you at the helm. First light what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna send up a flare. That's your signal to start the run. When we hit top speed, that's when we'll blow the bridge. If you get through, we're home free. (suspenseful music) (speaking foreign language) Okay, Gonzo. Get back to the boat. Tell Chief we're on schedule. - See you on the other side. - Okay. - [Mary] Those should buy somebody a nice retirement. - Buy a hell of a lot of weapons for the resistance. - Well, if I were you, I'd be real careful with that. I mean, you don't want it to fall into the wrong hands. I keep hearing these rumors that the war's over with and there may be some people who lack your patriotism. - Hey. Believe me, I'll do what's right. - [Gonzales] Chief. - What's happening? - Everything's set. We're on schedule. - Let's get ready. Let's go. - Whatever happens later, I want you to stay down below. Do you understand? - Yes. - This is for you. This has always kept me safe. Now it's going to protect you. - Are you giving me this? - [Gonzales] Yeah. - To keep or just to wear? - It's yours. (tense music) (speaking foreign language) - Here we go. - Okay, boys. Let's move it. (dramatic music) (speaking foreign language) - Gonzo, what the hell's Sam waiting for? If he doesn't blow it now, we can kiss our ass goodbye. - Cover me.

(explosions booming) (grunting) (explosion booms) (men yelling) (explosions booming) (man yells) (yelling) - Where's Thomas? - [Sam] He didn't make it. (tense music) Chief, what's the damage? - She took a hit on the port engine. She's taking in a lot of water. - All right, we're gonna have to lighten the load. - Not that one. That one stays. - What? - So, why do you want to hold onto these dossiers? We just throw 'em over, they go to the bottom. Go ahead, guys. Now. - If this goes, I go with it. - [Sam] I don't know what you're talking about. - I do. Our American war hero figured he could clean up on this war. He's got a crate full of gold. - Yeah, I ain't leaving here empty-handed. - A real war hero, huh? (guns fire) (yells) - What do you wanna do? - Fuck you. (gun fires) (grunts) (gun fires) - Skipper. (grunting) You're okay, Chief. We're going home. (dramatic music)
