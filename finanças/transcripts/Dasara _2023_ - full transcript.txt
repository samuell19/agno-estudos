Yamunda! Never admit defeat My songs will always be in your hearts You are always with me We will never part This is true I'm not a Rangoon kid. I am Rangoon Rowdy! If one Seetharama Raju dies, a million Seetharama Rajus will be born again! My salutations to all the great people! REMEMBERING SILK SMITHA THANK YOU, MADAM My name is Dharani. These chimney stacks are at the boundaries of my village. The village is surrounded by piles of coal. One has to carefully look through the smoke to find our village. Even the air around our village is polluted. The Lord Anjaneya. The local deity of our proletariat and our strength. The cacophony of bomb blasts is constant. This is our village, Veerlapalli. VEERLAPALLI Our day starts at a bar. Bloody hell! It's been a while since daybreak, yet he is nowhere to be found. What's the time? Every day you stop the bus here to consume alcohol. Why do we have to face this nuisance every day? Don't you care about your wife and kids? What are you doing here? You and your wretched addiction! -You bloody… -Your addiction has made my life hell. Hey, I'm talking to you. Oh god! You bloody! I can't anymore. Will he come today or not? Everybody drinks the same alcohol, but the place where one has to drink is based on what caste one belongs to. After watching all this, don't think of us as addicts. Alcohol is not an addiction for us but an integral part of our tradition. Give it to him. Hey, hold on, I'll give it to you. Give it to him. Kanakayya, the owner of Silk Bar. His persona is greater than the sarpanch of our village. -Hey, scoundrel… -Hey! I am declaring a prohibition on alcohol consumption, as per my promise to my sisters and brothers. Your village is doomed hereon. Look, Silk Bar has become desolate now When in pain, there’s nothing to console Without the liquor, dances At the wedding have vanished There is no noise heard in the streets There’s no one seen Accompanying the corpse now Even when we've wept so bad Not a single drop of tear is out Look, Silk Bar has become desolate now SADAYYA MEDICAL SHOP Sundaraiah got sick in the summer Without liquor PEOPLE'S HOSPITAL VEERLAPALLI Somanna who nurses people Has started drinking normal soda People have ceased all activities And started searching for alcohol No one cared about the owner of Silk Bar Look, Silk Bar has become desolate now When it is raining People are sleeping quietly Sales of mutton have dropped Due to the liquor ban Searching for a lucky drop Of alcohol in the remaining empty bottles Radhamma lost her sleep due To the unavailability of alcohol The baby cried for milk And her father cried for liquor Look, Silk Bar has become desolate now He locked and sealed the bar Look, Silk Bar has become desolate now May NTR be happy for wiping away our tears By prohibiting alcohol, he gave us the gift of better days The image of Silk Smitha has faded away And the village has turned to dust The Silk Bar has become desolate now This is me. Suri is my best friend. He is practically the other half of my heart. This is the first Dasara festival after the alcohol ban. Nobody is happy… except me. Vennela! She is also my friend. I always saw her as a friend… but today, I see her as a beautiful fairy from heaven. Hey, you rascal! Why did you blow out the lamp? Hey, Dharani, come here. If you do that again, I'll thrash the hell out of you. Light this up. Hey, there's some point of contention there, let's go! There is no dearth of alcohol. We have it in abundance. I will use my power to bring in more liquor. What we need is the right place to set it up. Peda Nambaiah, The Sarpanch of our village. His stepsons, Rajanna And Shivanna. Owning a bar was more prestigious than being in power in his eyes. Hence he had been eyeing it for a long time. The winner of the Sarpanch elections, will have the sole right to own the bar. The ownership will be decided by elections five years later. What do you say? Kanakayya realized that once he lost the bar then he won't get it back. He resisted. But the people who were reeling with no alcohol turned a deaf ear to Kanakayya's cry. If you want this village to be drenched in alcohol again, have this peg and commit your support to us. You have no other option, brother. Agree to it. Look at how every pair of eyes is waiting for alcohol. Kanakayya was sacrificed to Nambaiah's politics Alcohol was the clear winner. This moment proved to be a defining turn in Veerlapalli's story. SILK BAR Hail Lord Rama! Hail Lord Rama! Hail Lord Rama! Happy Dasara, Vennela Happy Dasara. Dharani! Oh, Mother! Did you get pricked by a thorn? Yes. Don't worry, you'll be fine. As black as a piece of coal Oh, Mother! As white as a piece of chalk We hum like the buzzing honey bees We don't stop the entire day We ride the black buffalo And roam around the whole town We forget about having food or water In the stillness of this classroom Writing my incoherent thoughts I'm concealing my writings Without being noticed by anyone I await for Vennela While licking my popsicle Watching her come across Feels like butterflies in my stomach-- LOVE LETTER I LOVE YOU VENNELA Hey! Guys, I'll tell you one thing but don't tell anyone else. I'm in love with Vennela. That day I realized how much I loved Suri. Between Suri's friendship and Vennela's love, I'd choose Suri over Vennela any day. Hey! You… Children! Peda Nambaiah is no more. We have declared a holiday for ten days. Go home! Before Nambaiah's body could be cremated, the animosity between the stepsons went public. The elders distributed the properties amongst them, but failed to decide the fate of the bar. That's when Peda Nambaiah's words came to their rescue. Whoever wins the sarpanch elections keeps the bar. That one line limited the politics of our village to one family. They divided the bar's flag into two, a finger-ring and an earring. They were to be used as symbols by the two of them. Rajanna believed that the one who had the power could own the bar. But Shivanna believed that one who used the bar well would eventually be in power. Similarly, people were more influenced by Shivanna's distribution of alcohol than Rajanna's word politics. Eventually, the alcohol won. The winner might be Shivanna but the one who defeated Rajanna was the only grandson of Peda Nambaiah and son of Shivanna, Chinna Nambaiah. He is the main reason for the defining turn in Veerlapalli's story. Wait, I'll tell you-- Can't you see? Give it here. Granny, why do you drink alcohol? For courage, son. AFTER FEW YEARS… Where is this Dharani? Don't you know about him? He will first drink and get intoxicated, only then will he come. -Hey, throw it! -Throw it! Hey, Dharani, throw it. Dharani! Hey, throw it! Hey, throw it! Come on, throw it! Come on, throw it! We are either completely Sober or extremely high All we do is drink, eat, and sleep Fight with us and get Your head beaten to a pulp! Hey, stop it. You fools! You and your bloody chorale. Hey, give them one more bottle of liquor. I'll see how they don't beat their drums. Have a peg, have a peg Have some lamb to go along with it Beat the drums Beat the drums Make people get up And dance vigorously to that music Let's get the heavens down! Let's have some drinks And make merry at this Silk Bar Get ready to rock and shatter the Dance floor let's see who dares to stop us Bloody hell! We celebrate friendship and The whole village fears our faction We celebrate friendship and The whole village fears our faction Ration rice along with Chilies is what we eat Friendship is the only asset we possess We consider coal from The ground to be our gold We live amongst people With hearts of gold. This village which provides Us with food is our mother The trains which provide Us livelihood is our father We bath along the buffaloes in our lake We have never heard the Crowing of a rooster! Bloody hell! We celebrate friendship and The whole village fears our faction We celebrate friendship and The whole village fears our faction We celebrate! We celebrate! A Barbie doll The beautiful creation of the Lord How did we find this Pretty lady in this village? Seetha had gone to fetch water And she came across Rama in this village One must live like crazy Life should have some spice Suck the bone marrow out of goat bones Don't eat the bland lentils We wear a dhoti as a staple. We don't care about anything in our lives -We drink Ambali but -We live a King's life -Every day is Dasara for us -Bloody hell! We celebrate friendship and The whole village fears our faction We celebrate friendship and The whole village fears our faction We celebrate! We celebrate! Bloody! What are we doing here? Nothing, dude. We got tipsy in the morning after having a few drinks and thrashed a policeman in an intoxicated state. Manhandling a police officer is illegal, right? That's why we are behind bars. Did you beat a police officer? Didn't I stop you? You, bloody! You get sloshed after drinking, thrash everyone in an intoxicated state, then once you are sober, you act as if nothing ever happened. What is this nuisance, dude? Call those boys. Come here! Come! You are doomed today. He is going to take you to task now! Sir, he's the one who thrashed me. Get me that lathi. Hey, it will be used on us. You senseless idiot. Sir, I swear on my grandma, one hit of that lathi and I'm going fall dead on the ground. There will be no second chance to beat me. Straight to the graveyard Please let me go, sir. I beg you, sir. You fool! Are you sure he is the one? He pissed his pants just at the sight of a lathi. Get lost. Hey, move! Let's go! What a waste of time early in the morning. He acts as a daredevil when high and a cowardly fellow when sober. Move! COURTYARD SHELTER Hey, Suri! What are you doing here? Bro, greetings! How's everyone in your family? I'm Vennela. First, get that beedi out. Aren't you ashamed of stealing coal and then ending up spending nights in jail? Shut up. You are stealing the eggs meant for children and giving us a moral lesson? Shut up. Two thieves never discuss their exploits with each other. Tell me, why are you here? To get a kiss from you. -Kiss? -Yes. You are asking for a kiss, not a bidi from a shop. Hey… -will you give me a kiss or not? -I will not. Get lost. How dare you reject Suri's request! Suri, kiss her. I'll guard the entrance. Dharani, you had it from me. I'm going to see your end. Suri, let me go. Otherwise, I'm going to kill you today. Vennela? Vennela? Stop! You, cowards. Hurry up, the man who conducts the census is here. Coming. Bloody, pain. -Is Suri at home, mother-in-law? -Don't call me mother-in-law, you witch. Let us get married. I'll deal with you then. Sister! Vennela! This is the new voter list for the upcoming elections. Give it to Shivanna. Okay. Uncle, Vennela passed this on. Nambi… this time we have 150 new voters. The young guys must remember only the ring symbol when they come to vote for the first time. I'll start the promotions tomorrow itself, Dad. Let's begin with the cricket match. Every player must wear the ring. This time, even Rajanna's soul must shiver to file a nomination against us. The cashier's post. Let's fire the old man, who is the cashier at the bar. The oldie occupying the cashier's post is of no use to us. Announce that the winner of the match will be the new cashier. They will go crazy. Once they wear the ring, the ring will come off only along with their finger. This time I'll contest the elections, Dad. Hereby, the news given to the villagers is that as always this time as well there will be a cricket tournament. The contest, named after Peda Nambaiah, will have a winning prize of 1500 rupees and the winners can drink as much alcohol as they wish to at Silk Bar. Not just that, one member from the winning team would be appointed to be the cashier of the bar. So, young and energetic boys are expected to utilize this golden opportunity to the fullest. -Sister? -Yes. Get me another ten eggs tomorrow. You don't need to go to school anymore. You can stay at home. The groom's family will come to see you. Here, have it. Did I ask you to look for a match for me? Here drink. This match is from a good family, we don't need your consent to call them. I love Suri and I'll marry only him. Shut up. I'll thrash both your cheeks if I hear his name in this house again! It is because of this behavior of yours that your father arranged a match for you. Shut up and marry the one we've arranged for you. -Hey, come on… -Wait… Vennela is here. What are you doing here at such a late hour? There are a few people who take a piss in their bed because they are afraid of darkness. Hey, stop it guys. Why are you here this late? I am expecting a match tomorrow. He works at Singareni. I knew that mother of yours was an opportunist! Hey, stop interfering in our matter! If he likes me, my folks are going to get me married to him. Shut up. Stop dragging your mother between us. If you really like me, convince your mother first, or else come, I'll marry you right here, right now. Pour some more for me. We've been loving each other since childhood, only when you realize that I'm not your girl anymore, will you understand my pain. If something untoward happens, I'm going to kill myself. Don't talk about such things. Where are you going? I'll come back. Hey Dharani… Dharani! Dude, no, listen to me. Let's go back. What is it? Why are you here? Come back. Forget about me. Where is Vennela, Aunty? Where will she be? She's sleeping inside. She's not there. She's with Suri, both busy romancing each other. What nonsense are you talking about? Look at this. This is ours. Listen to me, Aunty. Get them both married. How will a jobless fellow take care of my daughter? I would rather get her killed than get her married to that guy. So you won't get them married? I won't. -What is happening here? -Hello, Mummy. So, you won't do it? Not at all. You! Everyone, listen up! If she won't get Suri and Vennela married, I will jump in this well and die. Did you see that? He is blackmailing us. Shall I give away my daughter to coal thieves? My daughter is a primary teacher. Primary teacher! Really? Bullshit… We are going to win the cricket tournament. We will get appointed to the post of cashier at Silk Bar, who every man of Veerlapalli respects the most. Will you give your daughter to Suri then? What? The bar cashier? Dharani… if he becomes the cashier of the bar, I'm going to give my daughter to him. I'll arrange a grand marriage and bless the newlyweds. That's how it is done! What about you, Aunty? Okay. I agree to it as we both are from the same caste anyway. Suri! Suri, they agreed to your marriage. Her mother didn't agree at first, but Dharani has cast his magic somehow. Hey, what is this? If you ever raise your voice at Suri? Don't. Because he is your husband. It's time to celebrate. -It's time to celebrate. -Hey, Dharani! We are on top of this world! Call Dharani to the bar. Did you come already? Brother, you asked him to come, didn't you? He has come. Did you call me, brother? Yes… You seem to play cricket well. Yes, sir. Then, what will happen if you don't play tomorrow's match? What will happen? The whole team will get out within five overs, sir. And Sai would become the cashier. That is what I want. Sai is our new cashier. Brother… What is it? I have to win tomorrow's match at any cost. I promised Suri that I would get his marriage fixed. Now, imagine you are returning home on your cycle and a truck crashes into you on the way. If you die in that mishap, will you possibly play tomorrow's match? You don't have any respect for my word, do you? He is petrified! Bloody, coward! Hey, why are you dancing? Catch the ball. I can't. Play properly, Darani! Out! Can't you field properly? -Go… -Play properly! I beg you. Please catch the ball when it comes to you. Go, stand there. What the… What happened to him? Hey… What happened to him? RUNS 224 WICKETS 04 Bloody! We've lost it. They have made a big score, man. Dharani, we have to bat deep to chase the score. Bro, I can't. Don't you see my condition? Dude, how will we win if you won't play? Can't you see? How can he play? Let's play our best, we shall either win or lose, and that's it. You, come with me. Suri! Suri! You raised my mother's hopes for nothing by mentioning the bar and the cashier position. Now, look what's happened. My mother won't ever look at Suri again. I would have found some other way to marry him. She would have succumbed to my grief at least. After these many years of our relationship, one match is going to decide our fate. Damn! Hey, get the money. He’s gonna rip you apart He has set the bar so high That no one can reach him He’s gonna break your bones As easily as breaking crockery Oh God, no one can stop him While he’s hitting all around the world Keep calm and watch him roar When the ball is dancing on his bat Just watch him till the sun goes down He’s gonna rip you apart He has set the bar so high That no one can reach him If he pulls up his lungi You are gonna witness a raging bull on the ground When he’s high after getting drunk You will witness Shiva's tandava On the pitch Oh, no! He’s a rising phoenix Start playing drums As he rips everyone apart Dharani is on the top You better step back He is gonna kick you out Try to stop him if you're a man! Greetings, everyone! The peculiarity of this tournament is the post of cashier! Who is going to get that post from your team? -Suri! Suri! -Suri! Suri! -Suri! Suri! -Suri! Suri! -Suri! Suri! -Suri! Suri! When I started in politics, one man took great efforts to separate us. But you… you proved that the villagers and the ring are inseparable. No, you gave him a befitting reply with your actions. The idea of giving the cashier position to the winner didn't occur to me but to Nambi and I'm proud of him. -Long live… -Brother Nambi! I hereby announce that Chinna Nambaiah will be our candidate for the next sarpanch elections. -Long live… -Brother Nambi! Hey, come on the stage. Long live! I was searching for you all around. What are you doing here? Suri and Vennela just went away. So you were providing security to them? Now they don't need you. It doesn't matter if someone sees them. But I know you won't pay heed to my words. Anyway, I must admit that because of you Suri is in the best phase of his life. Yes! Even she is very happy. Is it? Are you playing dumb? You didn't notice her happiness? Tell me something, did you really forget her? Of course. So you don't have any problem with their marriage? It's Suri's marriage. It should be the talk of the town. So you've really forgotten all about her? Yes! I have moved on from her. Don't irritate me! How did you deduce that she was there just by listening to her anklets? Just because she was upset, why did you go and talk to her family instead of Suri? I pleaded with you to forget about her but you won't. At least share your feelings with Suri but you won't do that either. If you didn't dare to express your love why the heck did you even love her? Damn! Do you remember? It was you who first loved Vennela. But now you are only concerned about Suri's marriage, aren't you? But the bride is Vennela, dude! Go to hell, bloody rascal! Hey Kiddo, that girl is not yours Let it go now, your paths have separated Find solace in your mother's lap Turn into a child, and forget everything Childhood is so amazing Every pain is temporary When a kid is insistent On touching the moon He is easily distracted by showing a candy Adulthood is evil It exclaims the truth out loud Hey kiddo, that girl is not yours Go to sleep like a small baby I have loved you Like a devotee worships a deity's idol I've contained myself to a boundary Such that I would stay away from you I've turned the blazing agony Into the flame of the sacred oil lamp I've bid farewell to the consecrated idol Of the deity in my tears I sent it, I've left it Like a wingless fly stuck in a whirlwind Like a baffled man's helpless cry With no possibility of uniting with you And the incapability of Staying away from you My life's a ruin! The wounded heart feels The salt being rubbed on the injuries But such is my life that I can't shriek in pain! The flag on Rajanna's house is being lowered. That means Nambanna wins unanimously. Yeah, he couldn't face the public when he lost to his younger brother. Now if he loses to his brother's son as well, the humiliation he will have to face will be tenfold. In his boxers. Hey, Cashier. One more bottle. Do you have some kind of sponge in your stomach? Give me a full bottle. Hey! Why did you come in? Okay, let that go. Oh, you must have remembered who you are, right? Seeing you roaming with those pigs all these days, I thought you were one among them. You are discriminating against my friends on the basis of their caste, what kind of shit-eating pig are you? Hey! Stop your nuisance. From tomorrow, I will be the cashier. I'll speak with Nambi bro and get all of them inside. You will be the cashier? Dharani took a full bottle as a bribe to make you lose the match. Didn't he tell you yet? Seems he's a cashier. Hey, if it was enough to scare him, he would have lost. But you gave him alcohol, which backfired on you. This is what digging your own grave means. You… -Hey… -What? Bloody hell! VOTE FOR RING How dare you! You bloody idiot! Sir. Please, sir. Sir? Sir! Let us go, sir. I beg you, sir. Sir, let us go. I beg you, sir. -Sir, please let me see my son once. -Hey, old man, move aside. Go sit there. Sir! -Sir! -Sir, please no sir… please Sir, I beg you, sir. Hey! Sir! Rajanna! Rajanna! Rajanna. POLICE STATION KAMANPUR Hello, Rajanna. How come you are here? These are substandard people, Rajanna. They wrecked the bar. Bloody fools. Look, Rajanna. I will tell you the truth. Shivanna has instructed me not to let them go. I'm not going to let them go. I want my boys to be released within five minutes. Rajanna… It won't take me more than five minutes to wreck this police station. You might be scared that you will have to face consequences from Shivanna's people if you release them. But if you won't release them, trust me, the consequences will be much worse. We thought we would never be released, Rajanna. They thrashed us badly, Rajanna. We would forever be indebted to you, Rajanna. Contest in this time's election, Rajanna. Are you crazy? Hey! Shut up and sit there. Go. Go to hell, idiots. Do as you wish. You must contest, Rajanna. Go have something to eat and go to sleep. No, sir. This time we have your back Where were you all these years? Now that Rajanna has helped out, he's suddenly become a God for you? Go and accept that cashier's post and lick Nambi's boots. Go. You came to him when you needed help. I will get the post on licking his boots. But I don't want a life where I will be inside and my friends will have to stay outside. We never voted for Rajanna. I agree it's our mistake. But not this time. We shall make you win, sir. I came here to help you and not for my political benefits. You will be called a good man for helping others in need. Politicize your helping, you will be called the Sarpanch. Dude, can we beat the bar? Everyone has forgotten that the bar belongs to the election winner. Let's remind everyone about the same. Agree to it, Rajanna. Losing is not new to me. But this time, I'll contest the elections for your sake. Now onwards, travel with your windows lowered, Rajanna. Long live Shivanna! Long live Shivanna! If someone asks me, "Are you afraid to stand with your friends?" If necessary, I will drink a full bottle to gather courage and support my friend. Let it happen as it is meant to be. Who stepped inside the bar after you? Dharani. Sign the nominations. Sign on it. You don't have to pour an ounce of liquor for anyone. Sixty percent of Veerlapalli's population are women. So what? Rajanna, take a look at this. To date, no woman has voted in the elections. If we can make them vote for us, we don't have to spend a single penny on liquor. Yet we would have a bumper victory! -Long live! -Brother Shivanna I have arranged this urgent meeting not to announce my participation in the elections nor to ask you all to vote for me. I just want to know why you've never gone to exercise your voting rights, sisters? Why should we vote, Rajanna? Can you tell me about a single thing that the village has gained from the elections? Before criticizing me, take a good look at your finger, have you ever voted? You have the right to ask questions only if you have voted. Else your words are worthless. Don't make us speak, Rajanna. We have requested Shivanna multiple times to move the bar from its original place. He responded with a big smile, but our request was never considered. You could not change the location of the bar, how shall we believe that you can change our fates? You are right. I agree. Now I feel like asking you for your votes. Vote for me. I promise you to change the location of the bar. Rajanna, think before making promises. Don't interfere with the business of Silk Bar, Rajanna. It's a sensitive subject. I have faced every possible humiliation in the past few decades. I have nothing to lose. If I win, I would make sure there would be no mother in this village who would be searching for her son at midnight holding a lantern. I would make sure, no woman awaits her husband's arrival after sunset with tears in her eyes. Will you really move the bar, Rajanna? That is in your hands. Vote for Rajanna and make him victorious. If your work is not done, grab me by the collar and question me. Suri's words made quite an impact on the ladies. In the Veerlapalli Sarpanch Elections, Thurpugutta Rajanna, who contested the elections on the symbol of the earring has won against his opponent, Thurpugutta Chinna Nambaiah, who contested the elections with the ring symbol with the bumper majority of votes. Similarly, Dharani who won as a member of the tenth ward has won as Deputy Sarpanch with the support of the rest of the ward members. SILK BAR The women's respect for Rajanna and their trust in Suri's words made us victorious this time. For the first time, alcohol had lost. This is a paradigm shift in Veerlapalli's story. There will be no discrimination in the bar. Henceforth every man in Veerlapalli will be treated equally. Come on. Long live, Rajanna! You are such a lucky guy, my Suri dear… Enough with your overacting! Here, have something. You never know how long it may take. Who made such a huge decorative mark? That much is necessary, such is my beauty! VENNELA SURYAM What are you doing here? I came here to take a leak. Is this urine? That's why I asked you to forget about her. I'm unfortunate in this lifetime. But Vennela will be my wife in my next birth, I'm damn sure. If Suri loves her again? I will sacrifice her again. I will sacrifice Vennela again for him. How can I let him suffer? He is my friend, bro. Hey… Hey, let go of me… go! Go and play some music… I'll come and dance Look at him, he is crying like a kid. I would sacrifice anything for my friends, bloody… Take them in. The marriage was a grand event, bro! Correct bro. Dharani, the curry you made was out of this world! By the way, why are you sober at your friend's wedding? -Take this. -Have it. -Come, let's go. -Where to go? What's happened to him today? Get up! Let's go. Hey, Srinu! Why is he here so late at night? The marriage just concluded and you're already at the bar? Suri is here, come on let's go inside, bro. Move… Bro, weren't all the guests sloshed? They slept in the function hall, right? Then who are these guys? Bro, the bar is closed. They don't look like locals Bro, there are too many of you. This much won't suffice for all of you. Hey! -Hey! -Hey! Hey! Run! Run! Hey! Come on, move… Hey! Hey! Hey! Oh god! VOTE FOR RING SYMBOL Hey! NAXALS WARNING FOR DHARANI AND HIS FRIENDS Let's go! Get on the bicycle. Don't worry. You'll be alright. I… I am here for you. Once, you were my childhood friend Now, you are my life partner Once, you were my childhood friend Now, you are my life partner Today you leave us in a pool of tears Your death leaves us inconsolable Who is going to light the pyre? My toe-rings And the bangles which you put On are still intact Look, my dear The marriage celebrations Had not fizzled out yet And we see death Dancing at our doorstep Which God Is to be blamed for my ruined fate? Your friends who always accompanied you Who dared any extremes for you Follow your corpse today They didn't leave you alone even in death Your childhood friend now becomes Your companion in the other world Don't go away from your people From your relatives And your faction Wake up Wake up Wake up, please wake up Once, you were my childhood friend Your death leaves us inconsolable -Have you gone mad? -Hey! See how you're bleeding. I got scared, Suri. You know everything about me except this. Vennela. I was scared you'd leave her as I did… if you got to know that I loved her. I have no idea… how heartbroken you were when you learned about it. Forgive me. Get back to me at least once. I want to drink alcohol with you. Except for these posters, we didn't find any weapons or any other evidence. Those guys should say it now. Then ask them. They destroyed the village, and now they are sleeping. Now who should be held responsible for the village's situation? If they really put up posters and killed people then they would kill with guns. Have you ever seen them chasing anyone like this? That is true. Think at least once. What did we do, Rajanna? Why would they want to chase and kill us? Even what you said is true, Dharani. They would kill with guns, why would they kill anyone by chasing them? Okay. Forget about that. What is this bruise on your head? He fell from a bicycle. Brother! Tell the truth. He injured his head when he hit it with a bottle. This is it! He doesn't remember that he hit his own head last night. How can he remember what he did when he was drunk? It's not a mistake to forget what you did when you were drunk. It's a mistake to forget what kind of a mistake you've made then. He beat up the police when he was drunk. He broke everything at the bar. He went to people's houses and created a mess. Let's forget all about these things. But now… he has forgotten about a big mistake he made. What's wrong? Four men and one woman's life. But the thing is… he doesn't even remember that his friend also died because of him. Even now, he's here with a drink. Now should we go to the village council because of him? And he's the head? And we're here, setting aside all its work. Let's go. Hey… don't leave him alone when he is drunk. Take care of him. He doesn't remember that he hit his own head last night. How can he remember what he did when he was drunk? Now he has forgotten about a big mistake he made. But the thing is, he doesn't even remember that his friend also died because of him. Four men and one woman's life. Hey… don't leave him alone when he is drunk. Take care of him. This is the village where we grew up, can't I roam in this village at night without being intoxicated? TURPUGUTTA CHINNA NAMBAIAH TURPUGUTTA CHINNA NAMBAIAH Hey, Nambi! Nambi! Come out! Dharani. Where is your husband? What happened? We won the cricket match. We broke everything at the bar. We made Rajanna win. Why did he kill them all just for that? Nambi! Come out! Mark my words. Today will be the day of your husband's death. Death. Nambi! You bloody… Nambi… My husband is not in the village. He will arrive tomorrow morning. Let that scoundrel come. When he gets here, I'll kill him immediately. You made him win the cricket match. You beat up Sai at the bar. You triumphed to be the Deputy Sarpanch. You did all these things, then why did he kill your friends? For Vennela. He killed Suri for Vennela. He lusts after her. His lust is at such peaks that he will burn the whole tree for a single leaf that obstructs his view. My husband knows how many saris she has and in what colors. While looking at her from this window, he used to put his hands on me. His lust was so intense that he used to go and smell her when she was out. The anger that you are feeling now because he killed your friends, is equal to the anger that he feels when he doesn't get to sleep with the woman he likes. He killed Suri the other day in only one shot. He killed the others so that no one would suspect him. He once killed Padma's husband as well. You are challenging a guy like him. Now, that naive girl's life is more important than your vengeance. If possible, see that Vennela won't end up like Padma. It depends on you if you can hide her or make her leave this village. Come play with the sword after that. Then I'll accept you as a man, no matter whether you kill him or die. But you have to do it before tomorrow's ritual. Suri's soul is still restless, that's why no bird has yet touched the food. It seems like you paid a visit to my house yesterday. My wife told me everything. If you want to take her away from this village, as she said, then erase those thoughts now. Brother! I'll take her away, sooner rather than later. Only my hands should touch her body. Got it? What happened? Get the vehicle to Vennela's house. Cute doll and the beloved doll of Siva Where are those smiles Of the cute baby now? When the lady is given a divine head bath Lord Rama hasn’t come down here When she was being made a widow Where did Lord Krishna vanish? When her pearl bangles were being broken Where did Lord Venkatesha go away? When the nocturnal thread Was being removed Where did Lord Paramesha disappear? No Lord has come down here No Lord has come down here Vehicle ready. No Lord has come down here Why have you come here again? Did you come here earlier to make her a widow? You said that he's your friend and married her off to a person who was going to die and made her life miserable. What else is left to do now for you here? It's been ten days, she hasn't said anything. She won't listen to our words either. Is he not the reason behind all this? Tell me! You're making her wear a nuptial chain when she's just become a widow? Do you have the courage to marry our family's girl? You scoundrels. Shut up, you scoundrels! Why are you talking about caste? For the last ten days, no one looked at us to see whether we were alive or dead. Mind your tongue! I'm asking this to protect the honor of our caste! I don't care about caste if she's getting a way to lead her life. Why should you bother when their own family doesn't have any problems? Dharani, take her with you. The food… You're not aware of what you've done. Your help will lead to his death now. I'm going to cut off everyone's necks this Dasara. He's not Lord Rama, and she isn't Sita to escape. However, I certainly am Ravana. Got it? His head should fall off in one fell swoop. If we kill him now, then we won't get to know who chased us. And he doesn't come off so easily. We should do something that he comes out all by himself. Bloody hell! Let's do it at the right time. Let's kill them altogether. -Teacher. -Teacher. For how many days will you be like this? Students have been asking me about you every day. That's why I brought them here. Yes, Teacher Vennela. I brought you mutton too. So this is the time for you to come out? Seems to me that you haven't experienced anything yet. Hey, Saida! Hey! Dharani is just a waste. He doesn't even dare to do anything unless he's drunk. Then what can he do for you? However, marriage is not your thing. Shall I tell you one thing? If you get married, then you have only one husband. But if you're a widow, then… Padma, tell her more. If you ever trouble my wife again, beware! I'll pluck out your… I don't care about the consequences… let's see. Whose permission did you take to marry me? Is it the right thing to do? To marry a girl without her consent? All the people of this village think that I'll go and marry anyone. They don't know that your armlet has made me helpless. I didn't even realize that I was in your house till dawn. Am I a toy from the market? I don't know where to go or what to do. Everything is happening because of you. I'm getting angry and I want to kill you when I see you. But I don't have any strength left in me. Why did you marry me? You are my friend, Vennela. I've seen you wearing beautiful clothes and jewelry ever since we were children. When I came back, I saw people breaking your bangles and removing the bindi on your face. I couldn't endure that. I was scared that maybe they'd take away your smile too. That's why I married you. It was my mistake to marry you without asking you. I didn't know what to do at that time. Forgive me. I want to say one thing to you. Loan sharks came to my house after my husband's death. I didn't know what to do. Chinna Nambi paid off my debts and then exploited me physically. So I surrendered to him for the sake of my children. People say that a woman is like the Lord Bathukamma. But they don't let widows celebrate the Bathukamma festival. Dharani made your life easier than mine. Even though he married you, he called you a friend. Where will you get a good husband other than him? If you don't want to treat him like a husband, treat him like a childhood friend. HAPPY NEW YEAR, VENNELA DHARANI What is this? What do you want to do with these weapons? I'm asking you! Why don't you answer me? We've collected these to kill the people who killed my friends. Don't shout at me now! You've been a coward all along, but now you have animosity with Nambi. My limbs tremble at the thought of its aftermath. Are you aware of the path you are taking with these weapons you have collected? Yes, we are aware of that. What will happen? We'll die. That's it. Then take our dead bodies and dig a grave beside my friends' graves. What are you saying? Suri didn't leave my hand before he died. I used to be so scared, but he gave me the courage. Now I can't live like this, knowing that he is no more. If it would've been him, dammit! He would've killed them by now. He wouldn't wait this long like me. Do you know how hurtful it is to watch a close friend die in front of your eyes? No matter what you say, if not now, I'll kill them tomorrow. Then why did you bring her along? If she becomes a widow again, do you want her to live like me? Look at me. Even Suri, who died, would wish for a long life for you. On the other hand, you want to die for them! We should be the ones to die in your hands not the other way around. I can't watch more people dying. I can't. Drop those weapons here. I beg your pardon, please. Your friends won't go far away from you. Like the sun that goes away and comes at dawn, they'll come to you in the form of your kids. -When is the wedding? -The day after tomorrow. -Is Dharani here? -Yes. He is here, uncle. -Come. -Dharani. Inzamam's father is here Why are you here suddenly? My daughter's marriage is approaching. So I'm here to invite you. Why all these formalities? We'll come. You used to come when your friend was here but now everything has changed. Okay. We'll leave. Please come to the wedding. -Sure. -Bye, sister. Hey, let's make this wedding a big celebration. MARRIAGE Hey, sister-in-law, he looks Dashing in a dazzling shirt He winked at me wearing goggles Hey, sister-in-law, he used to sit At home wearing a tattered shirt Hey, sister-in-law, he lies On the bed in a shabby lungi I sprayed perfume in The days when we were newly married I was right behind you all the time I was kissing you and getting flowers Your talks were so sweet as sugar You changed and your voice is loud now I got addicted to liquor Hey, sister-in-law, after getting drunk He beats me up badly Just once in a while half-heartedly He makes loves for his needs Man in dazzling shirt Never brings me any gift Hey God! Hey God! He came in like a thief while I was in the kitchen He was pinching at my waist Now he always is pointing out my mistakes He says not to overreact I took such great care Of you like a baby Didn’t I always console you? You always overreact everywhere Aren’t you ruining my prestige In the streets? What’s wrong with him and What has possessed him? Maybe I got old, I can’t bear it anymore He’s ruining my image In public in return now Hey, sister-in-law, he looks Dashing in a dazzling shirt He winked at me wearing goggles Hey, brother-in-law She never asks anything openly Hey, brother-in-law She never does what I said She always sits in the neighbor’s house And keeps complaining about me Hey, brother-in-law She says she was harmed Hey, brother-in-law She always is into weeping Your sister, when I try to begin some chat She always is into over criticizing me Either in dark or at the front door A husband protects like the eyelids Even in any mess when you are with him He stands opposing And wins over the hurdles Even when in any great troubles He keeps you safe in his heart Your bindi and your bangles Are his valuable life forever I made mistakes in life due to politics, but never have I committed sins! It's despicable enough that you crave another woman while being married. But you've stooped further by killing people for her. A ten-headed demon died at the hands of a single-headed king because of a woman. Are our lives greater than myths? I made a mistake by giving birth to you. Dharani! Have you ever loved someone? Oh my God! Who is that girl? I was a child when I first saw her on this street at the Bathukamma festival. You know how beautiful she was when she wore her short plait from back to front, accompanied by the sound her anklets made as she walked by slowly. It was as if Goddess Gauri was carrying Goddess Bathukamma in her hands. I thought she was the one for me. Did you confess your love to her? I was scared. After that, she fell in love with another guy. She's married as well. Oh! She's married? Have you ever thought of her? It's been 15 Dasara festivals since I last saw her. But I'm stuck there. Hold tight DASARA CELEBRATIONS VEERLAPALLI It's done! Let's move there… Hail Lord Rama! Vennela. SIDDHAM SURIYA Which do you believe is greater, love or lust? I'm asking you. Which do you believe is greater, love or lust? Lust is greater. Do you know how beautiful you were in that white sari the day Suri died and you were crying over his dead body? Even when you were crying you looked so beautiful. Dammit! I'm the one who killed Suri. How can you get scared just by this? I killed him for you. Suri married you because he had no idea that if he did, he would be dead. That's why I killed him. I thought you'd be mine if he died and I waited for ten days. But Dharani entered and married you. Scoundrel! He married you even though he was aware that I would kill anyone who did so. Just to save you from me. But I'm scared of one thing. The love Dharani has for you. Yes. It was as if Goddess Gauri was carrying Goddess Bathukamma in her hands. I thought she was the one for me. Dharani's love for you scares me. Even though he sacrificed his love for Suri, his love for you has brought you together. Now I'm scared, what if his little moment of love, is greater than 12 years of my lust? That's why I'll kill Dharani today. Here you go. You don't have a sari in this particular color. On Dharani's 11th day after his death, wear this sari and be ready. You belong to me. Hail Lord Rama! Hail Lord Rama! Hail Lord Rama! Hail Lord Rama! DASARA CELEBRATIONS Hey! Hail Lord Rama! Dharani! Dharani! This Dasara won't be like last year. Bloody hell! I promise you… what happens will happen eventually. Let's see. Dharani! Dharani! What's happening here? Nambi is the one who killed my friend. You… The memories that are engraved In the heart forever Bury them. Bloody hell! Hey! Hey! Hey! Please let me go, sir. I will kill him and come with you I beg of you, sir. I will kill him and come with you DHARANI -Hey! -Hey! DHARANI AFTER 7 DASARA FESTIVALS WELCOME She went to Narayana's home to help a pregnant woman. You've given birth to a girl. How are you, dear? What's wrong with you, sister? My husband became a drunkard and died. Suri's words about holding one's collar for his unjustness are gone with him. It would've been better if God had given me some beauty. I would've prostituted for the sake of my children. SILK BAR How many women in this village have smiles on their faces? Our lives are like this. I thought that the village had changed, but it hadn't. Who are you to burn the bar? Hey, Dharani! Only the ones who haven't lost their family members to drinking can step forward. If anyone else tries to put this fire out… I had assumed we had more female voters… because the male birth rate was low in this village. I didn't know that it was because all women were becoming widows. Bloody hell! Shame on us all!
