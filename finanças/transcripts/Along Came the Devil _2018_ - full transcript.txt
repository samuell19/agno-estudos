Do you know how much I love you? No. More than all the sand on all the beaches in all the world. Describe her to me again. What was she like? She had long hair, a beautiful smile. She wore a pretty blue dress that shined in the sun. What about this? She loved it and wore it every day. Just like you. Was she pretty? Very pretty. The prettiest. Did she love us? Always. I am not going to tell you both again. All right? I put you in here, and I want no talking. And I don't want you to think about leaving this fucking closet. Do I make myself crystal clear? Yes, Daddy. And don't make me come back one more time, because if I do, I swear to God I'll grab that necklace from around your fucking neck so fast. Now cover your ears, both of youse. I wish Mommy was here. Come on. Now I lay me down to sleep. Pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, pray the Lord my soul to take. God bless Mommy, God bless Daddy, God bless the house. What are you doing, silly? You have a better chance of going to heaven than I do. I wish you would take me with you. I like it. Jordan. Ashley. Ashley. Unbelievable. Kids? You had kids in here? You son of a bitch. - What are you talking about? - You're so disgusting. Rosemary, wait. Don't. Don't go. What did I tell you two? Eh? - Good morning. - Morning. You slept on the couch again. Is your bed not comfortable? My bed was shaking. Shaking? Maybe we had another tremor. I have an idea. Why don't you come to church with me today. Um... I have so much I need to get done before school tomorrow. Okay, well, I'm going to try again next week. I'll see you when I get home. Please eat something, okay? Hello? Aunt Tanya, are you here? Hello? The Lord says, if your sins be a scarlet, let them be made white as snow. And if they be red as crimson, they shall be made white as wool. So it is important to both forgive and allow forgiveness in order to receive God's true blessings. So remember that next time someone swoops in and steals your front-row parking spot at the grocery store. Just like Mrs. Johnson forgave me last night when I accidentally swooped in and stole her spot. My bad, Mrs. Johnson. And speaking of blessings, I'm truly blessed to be welcomed into this church community with such loving and open arms. You've really made this transition this past two months an easy one. And I'm especially blessed to receive the spiritual guidance and leadership of Reverend Michael. Seems like we had a good turnout today. Yes, we did. I thought you did very well. I just need to put together some readings for the next youth meeting. I see you found a title for my personal collection. Oh. Um... yes, sorry. It just caught my eye. Well, that's okay. Could you put it back, please? Absolutely. I didn't know that you were into demonology and exorcism. I was. Well, I find it fascinating... Some books are best left on the shelf. Of course. All right, well, I'm off. See you later. Good sermon. Ashley. Ashley? Hello? Hey. You don't remember me, do you? It's Hannah. Hey. It's amazing. You look exactly the same, except older and taller. Do I look the same? You're taller. Where did you guys end up going? You kind of just disappeared. It's messed up how we didn't even get to say goodbye. Yeah, we went up north. That's a cute necklace. Where did you get it? - It's so vintage. - Thanks. It was my mom's. It's cool. How's your sister? Where's she at nowadays? She's good, she got a scholarship to Penn State. What brought you guys back? Jesus, once I escape, I am never coming back. Do you remember the last time you were here? It was a long time ago. Nothing much has changed, so... - Yeah. - Won't be different. So, what do you do around here? Gosh. Um, we go to the lake. We... you know. Yeah. Go to the movies. That's fun. There's a couple cute boys at school. This is it. Your room's a little crazy, friend. What is all this stuff? Oh, this is my gear. The Mormons might be kind of weird, but they're onto something. Onto what? Angels and demons walking the earth. I know, it sounds crazy, but I've been reading a lot about it, and it all sounds so epic. Just want to make sure I'm ready in case anything ever happens. - Serious? Angels and demons? - Yes, seriously. Demons are serious stuff. Haven't you ever seen "The Exorcist"? Once Regan used that Ouija board to invite Captain Howdy in, she was fucked. I've never seen it. You never seen "The Exorcist"? We have to watch it one night. Do you remember Shane Stevens? He was the nerdy kid with the turtle. He'd follow us around the gym. Had a crush on you. Kinda. He's hot and single, and we're hanging out tonight. Do you want to come? I don't know, Hannah. You're invited. You're coming. Oh, there you are. I thought you were upstairs. Hi, I'm Hannah. You must be Aunt Tanya. Yeah. Miss Winbourne, or Aunt Tanya. "Tanya" is good. Cool. What are you guys up to? I was just going to make dinner. Do you wanna stay for dinner? Oh, no. Hannah are I were going to go to the dock and hang out with a bunch of friends. Oh, you were going to go? Do you mind if we go? Just don't be late. You have school tomorrow. Yeah, we won't. We won't be. Okay. Do you know what happened with that picture? Yeah, I found a school picture of Mom, and I thought I'd put it up there. Is that all right? Yeah, it's fine. Whatever you need to feel at home. I'm gonna run upstairs and get changed. - Okay. - It was nice to meet you, Aunt Tanya, or Tanya, or Miss Winbourne. Ooh! Ooh, you're so creepy. - Carrie! - Hannah's here. What is up? - The life of the party is here. - Finally. Took you long enough. How are you? Great. Good to see you. I thought I'd spend more time with my girl. Your girl? You know what I'm saying. So, everyone, this is our long-lost friend, Ashley, You may know her as the little girl from art class. But as you can see, she's fully grown to start some trouble. - Whoo! - So, friends, Ashley. - Ashley, friends. - Nice to meet you, Ashley. Hey, I'm Bryce. Call me Big Bryce. Big Bryce. Hey. How are you? Get you something to drink. - It's good to see you again. - It's good to see you too. It's been a while. Yeah. Well, make yourself at home and... let's party. - You want a drink? - No, thanks. I'm good. Oh, yeah, I don't drink either. It's cool. - All right. - Let's go. Do you remember me? Yeah. You used to follow us around gym. Oh, man. How's your pet turtle? Myrtle? She wasn't long for this world, I guess. She, uh... she's in a better place. It's good to have you back. Thanks. Hey, I know something fun. Do you guys have that new EVP app? What, the stupid "Ghost Hunters" shit? - You're such a dork. - Yeah, a cute dork. What's EVP? Oh, my God. Check it out. EVP is "electronic voice phenomenon." It's the app they use in all those ghost-hunting shows. - It totally works. - I got it on my phone here. Of course you do. Dude, he's so whipped. Everyone, listen, the phone's going to pick up anything Voices, paranormal activity, anything. Listen. Are there any spirits out there that want to talk to us? I don't know, Hannah. This is kind of weird. Come on, don't worry about it. I'm sure this stuff doesn't even work. You guys hear that? Oh, my God. I think it's saying for the girls to show us their boobs. I'm sure that's what you heard, perv. No, but really, listen. Ashley. Ashley. What the hell is wrong with this girl? Are you okay? What's wrong? I don't know. I think I saw my mom. You're such a dick, Bryce. - Ashley, wait up. - Dude, what's your problem? She's screaming, we're trying to have a good, quiet evening. I'm leaving. Are you coming? I drove you here, so you better come. Ashley. Aunt Tanya. Ashley, you okay? Yeah, I'm fine, Aunt Tanya. I'm taking a bath. Okay. Come in. Hey. How was your thing with your friends? It was okay. You look so much like your mom. That's her necklace, isn't it? Yeah. I've worn it since I was a little kid. It's like a little piece of her. You know, I bought that for her on her 16th birthday. I hope you know how happy I am to have you here, Ashley. I do. I just wish Jordan was here. I know. It's going to be okay. You know that, right? How do you know? Because I know. And I know that God never gives us more than we can handle. I just feel like he's given me a lot, and I'm really trying to handle it all. I know you are. But you are so strong. You're going to get through this. And if there's anything I can do to make you feel more at home, please let me know. Thank you. Ready for your first day of school tomorrow? Ready or not, here it comes. All right, you get some sleep, sweetie, okay? I'll see you in the morning. - Good night. - Good night. You boys don't be late to school, now, or we'll all be in trouble. Okay? Thanks, Sam. Good morning. Hi, good morning. Pastor John, what's the word? Oh, hey, Sam. Same as always. God's word. Ashley? Yeah? Hi. I'm... I'm John. I'm the new pastor at Celebration. I work a lot with the youth ministry, and your Aunt Tanya told me a lot about you. Okay. Well, how are you doing? I mean, are you happy to be back? Yeah. It's all right. Well, what's left of it. Yeah. I know the feeling. Well, I like this part of town. I feel like it's got a lot of personality. I kind of feel like it's the last link to the past. You know, we got a lot of really great events planned at church. It'd be really nice to see you there sometime. Yeah, it'd be cool. Is that the 7D? Yeah, it sure is. That's right, Tanya told me that you're into photography. Yeah, I love it. I have the Mark V, but I heard the VII takes better pictures. Yeah, the picture quality is great. It just... sometimes the exposure's off. Maybe you could take a look at it? Yeah. You know, I'm always looking for talented photographers to take pictures at church events. I'd love to. Can I get back to you about that? - Okay, great. - Pastor John. Hey. Hey. I'll see you Sunday. All right. Hannah, haven't seen you at church in a while. I see you smiling. What, you think he's hot? No, but he's pretty cool. Yeah, okay, you know for a pastor. Whatever. Hey, are you okay? Freaked out yesterday. Yeah, it was nothing. It was something. Did you see something? What were you saying about your mom? I don't know. My mind's playing tricks on me. Are you sure? Because it just seemed... Hannah, it was nothing. Whatever you say, Ash. But it was definitely something. You girls playing the next EVP session? - I want in. - Come on, man, knock it off. You guys want a ride to school? Really? This is our workout for the day. And besides, the school's right up the street, dumbasses. All right, fine, but you're missing out on the pleasure of our company. See you later, ladies. See you at school, sweetie! Wait, hold on. Hannah, what is this? It's Shane. I gave him your number. Wait, Hannah... What are you doing? I don't know. What do you think? You take a look. One second, excuse me. Hello? Speaking. - Hey. - Hey, have you seen Ashley? I've been texting her all day and she's not responding. I was actually about to ask you. I was going to see if she needed a ride. Did you hear what happened? Yeah, is she okay? There she is. Hey, Ashley, what happened to you? - Nothing. - It wasn't nothing. You almost gave Mr. Diggler a heart attack. I just want to go home. All right, just stay here. I'll go get my truck and I can take you home, okay? Did you see your mom again? Um... I don't know. Holy shit, you did. Hannah, please stop, okay? No, Ashley, there's something going on with you. I'm coming over tonight. I just... I need sleep, that's it. I'll see you tonight. Not the best first day of school, huh? I just want to say that I'm sorry about this morning. We were just messing with you guys. This is Ashley. Leave a message. Hey, Ash, I'm just calling to check on you. I just got off the phone with your principal. So call me when you can, okay? - Thanks for the ride. - Yeah, no problem. So I guess I'll see you tomorrow? Yeah. Could I give you another ride tomorrow? Sure. Hey. No, no. I'm just glad you're okay. Okay, we'll talk when I get home, okay? All right, I'll be home soon. Okay. Hello? Hello? This isn't funny. Hey! Hannah, you can't... shit, scare me like that. - Sorry. I'll knock next time. - Oh, my gosh. You were just, like, knocking all over the house. What are you talking about? Very funny. It wasn't me, but okay. What's that smell? I don't know. Something must have died in the vent or something. Hey, is that a Bible? We're going to need it. So, what are we doing? This is my first time trying this. Do you remember that EVP thing that I showed you last night? Well, this is way better for communicating with one specific dead person. - It's totally old-school. - I don't know, Hannah. Trust me. We have to figure out if this is actually your mom trying to reach out to you. - What if it's... - What if what? What if it works? What's your mom's first name? It's super important. Sarah. Okay. If Sarah reveals herself to you, you have to acknowledge her and ask her to come back to you. That way, we can figure out what's keeping her here. Okay. Okay. Let's begin. Hello, Sarah. I'm Hannah, and I'm here with your daughter, Ashley. She'd like to speak with you. Will you communicate with us? Sarah, if you're here, give us a sign. Hannah, what's with this mirror? Should we close our eyes or something? No, I think the mirrors acts as a conduit to the spirit world. We have to look directly into it in order to see your mom. Sarah, please speak now. Sarah, please come forward and speak with your daughter. What the hell? Did you hear that? - Yeah. What was that? - I don't know. Sarah, show us that you're here. What the hell? I saw something. What did you see? I don't... I don't know. Call her, Ashley. She's here. - Mom. - Ask her again. Mom, are you here? Please, Mom, I'm begging you, I want you in my life. Will you please come back to me? I love you. Please! What did you do? I did what you told me to do. This doesn't feel right. What do you mean? Hey, it's freezing in here. What are you guys doing? What is that smell? I should probably get going. - Bye, Miss Winbourne. - Hannah, wait. Hannah, wait. We're messed up. That shadow was dark. I'm not sure it was your mom. - I just... - What do you mean? I don't know. I'll see you. Well, she left in a hurry. - What's going on? - Nothing. It was nothing. Next you'll tell me what happened in school is nothing? I don't want to talk about it. - Okay, Ashley... - I don't want to talk about it! Listen, Ashley, you may not want to talk to me about every single thing you're doing, but you will not disrespect me. I'm sorry, Aunt Tanya. I didn't mean to be disrespectful. Look, this isn't easy for me either. I'm sorry, okay? Today was really hard. Is there anything I can do to help? I don't think so. How about we have a movie night? We can watch something light, we can pig out on popcorn. It was your mom and my favorite thing to do. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Here you go. - Thank you. So, tell me more about you and mom's movie nights. Oh, they were our favorite things to do. Mostly, it was just an excuse to stay up late and talk about boys and school. And boys. We talked about everything. Did she ever talk about wanting to be a mom? Or having kids? I've preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anoints... I... I have failed. I have failed you. I have failed thee. I need to tell you something. Okay. I'm pregnant. Tanya, listen. There's something going on with me. I'm hearing these voices in my head. And it's... it's making me do things. Really bad things. And I can't control it. I don't know what you mean, that you can't control it. - I need your help. - I don't... Tanya... You need to see someone. You need medical help. - Sarah... - I'm scared. Please, Tanya, just pray with me, okay? Okay, okay, okay. Dear heavenly Father, please watch over Sarah. Please cast out her afflictions and heal her mind and her thoughts and action. Please watch over my sister. What is it? What are you saying, Sarah. - You don't believe me. - I do. I don't know what to do. You don't believe me. Aunt Tanya? Ashley. Oh, God, I'm... - Are you okay? - I must have had a nightmare. I'm sorry I fell asleep on you. No, it's okay. Um... You know, I'm going to go to bed. I don't think you'll like the movie anyways. It doesn't have a happy ending. No, you know what? I'm... I'm going to head to bed too. It's way past my bedtime. You sleep good, angel. Thanks. I see you got your appetite back. How'd you sleep? Ashley, what happened to your shoulder? Oh, I just bumped into some branches in the woods. It doesn't look like you just bumped into branches. - Let me see. - I got to go, I'm late. Bye. Hey. Hi. Ready to go? Yeah. I was thinking after what happened yesterday, we could use a little adventure. What do you say? I say, get in. All right. Wait, where are you going? Hop in. They say that if you close your eyes, you can feel that my hands are going to move a lot faster. You want me to close my eyes? Yeah, close your eyes. Trust me. You ready? Oh, come on. - I'm going easy on you. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - Close your eyes. All right. - Last one. - Okay. - Actually try this time. - All right. Ow. Jeez. So, what's it like being back? I don't know. Do you like my outfit? Yeah. Yeah, I do. Then come closer. Okay. Do I scare you? - Do you scare me? - Yeah. No, you don't scare me. Then kiss me. Whoa, whoa, whoa, come on. Slow down a bit. We don't have to go that fast. Oh, come on, isn't this what you want? I guess. Hold on. Ashley, I just want to see something. Stop for a second. What the fu... You bit my tongue. Oh, come on, Shane. What the heck is wrong with you? Sorry, excuse me a second. Hello? I'm sorry, what? No, she left this morning for school. Are you sure? Okay, thank you. This is Ashley. Leave a message. Where are you? Call me now. - Is everything okay? - No. I got to go. This is Ashley. Leave a message. Hey, Ash, where were you today? Call me. Ashley? Ashley? Ashley? Ashley? "Inviting spirits into our world "can lead to the unintended and lethal consequence of demonic possession." This is Ashley. Leave a message. Ashley, can you call me? I have to tell you something. Ashley? Ashley, we need to talk. Ashley, I am talking to you. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What happened? Okay, put your head back. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's all right. What are you doing here so late? Oh. I just wanted to come and make sure everything was good for tomorrow's small group. What about you? What are you doing here so late? Pray. Hmm. Come on, Reverend. I'll give you a ride home. I can come in early tomorrow. We can talk in the car. Well, thank you for your generosity, but I don't need a therapist or a chauffeur at the moment. What do you need? Uh... forgiveness. Don't we all? Well, you came to the right place. What's on your heart? You ever doubt, John? Of course. Doubt is part of humanity. I doubt and I question, but in the end my faith is strengthened in... what? Spare me the seminary bullshit. I mean, really doubt. Not just in him, but in yourself. Your goodness. Your ability to fight for goodness in others. Hmm. I believe there's a name for that. - A wavering assurance. - Oh, that's right. We're always quick with the names, aren't we? To name is to destroy. There was a time when I was pretty good at that: naming. Goodness and God, love. Wish I could name it now. Hmm. I'm afraid I don't follow. Well, you won't, Reverend. To destroy your wavering assurance? To find peace in your own goodness? What do I want? What do I want more than anything? More than finding peace in my own goodness? I want to destroy the darkness. I want to make it right for all those souls that I have failed. Then that is what I will help you do. And into the presence of the Lord, there is no doubt. Yes. In the presence of the Lord, there is no doubt. That was more blood than I have seen come out of anybody nose in my whole life. Two pints. Tanya. - How is she? - She's fine. It's just a nosebleed. Just a nosebleed? There was blood everywhere. Look, nosebleeds often look much worse than they are. It's the stress of the environment could be the cause. Change affects each of us very differently. No, I'm... I'm really worried about her. You don't need to worry, Tanya. No, you weren't there. You didn't see her. Paging Dr. Carraz. I got to run. But, you know, I left her in the care of an on-call psychiatrist, Dr. Liles. You can go see her. She's in good hands. It'll do her good to talk to someone. Okay? Hi, Tanya, I'm Dr. Liles. Thanks for coming in. There are just a few things I needed to go over with both of you. I'm going to prescribe an anti-depressant I want you to take for a few weeks. It'll help make the transitional period a little easier. I'm also going to prescribe a sedative to help you sleep. Do you really think she needs all that? I do. Her mind and body need sleep in order to heal themselves. And the medicine will make her calm and enable that to happen. Okay? But if you have any questions, please feel free to call me. I will. Thank you. You're okay, kiddo. But if you need anyone to talk to, call me anytime. screams] Tanya. Tanya... - Good morning. - Good morning. Thank you for being here on this beautiful Sunday morning. Please be seated. Now, this is the will of him who sent me, the Father, that I should lose nothing of what he has given me, but that I should raise it up on the last day, for this is the will of my father who sent me. That whoever holds the son and believes in him shall have everlasting life. And I will raise him up on the last day. They said therefore to him, "Lord, give us always this bread." But Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life." "He who comes to me shall not hunger." "He who believes in me shall never thirst. "But I have told you that I have seen thee, and you do not believe." I thirst Apostles' Creed. I'll feast on her soul. Look, I got to run to the hospital. I'm going to come check on you as soon as possible. I beg you, leave her with me. I can help her. I am not leaving her side. The only reason I brought her was because I didn't know what else to do. Her soul is in jeopardy. She needs to be on holy ground for her own survival. It's happening again, what happened with Sarah. Don't you dare say her name. What did you do to her? I knew something was wrong with her, and I left anyway. Well, that is not happening again. Tanya... I'll figure it out on my own. Come to my office, now. So, what's going on with Ashley? I need to know exactly what we're up against. I've seen more evil than any one man should. And demonic possession is real. I've had too many people that I have loved and led consumed by evil, and I have fought tooth and nail, and I have lost. I have lost more than you can begin to imagine. It is shaken my faith and my belief in myself to the core. I don't know what to say. I want to help any way I can. The greatest weapon we have against the demon lies within his name. Well, the demon is commanded to give his name in the name of Jesus Christ, shouldn't it? Not always. I believe this one has been invited in, like Ashley's mother's case. He won't give up his name so easily. Ashley's mother? Yes. Well, then we have to figure out a way. We have to help any way that we can. Yes. Grab as many books as you can on possession and name demonic entities. I'm going to give you a crash course in performing an exorcism. We have to go to Tanya's and fight for Ashley. We can't have evil win. Not again. Possession has three demonic stages. The first is infestation. A demon will be active in a place, or space. Some of these signs may be objects moving, unrecognizable whispering and putrid smells. The second is oppression. This is when the demon is focused on one specific person or individual. The demon will take the form of a loved one to earn trust. The final stage is possession. This is when the person invites a demon in, allowing the demon to take complete control. The only way to defeat the demon is to unlock the secret of his name and use it against him. How is she? She's not good. - Where is she? - She's upstairs, resting. There was an accident involving Hannah. Is she okay? I'm going to go see Ashley. Tanya. This is more than you can handle on your own. It's beyond your control. It's gotten worse, hasn't it? I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do. Oh, dear Lord. Redo that restraint. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth, as it is in heaven. And what of my will? Lord, Jesus Christ, is upon you. Lord, protect Ashley. And keep her safe. Ashley's not here. Is this your handiwork? Ah, ah, ah, Michael. Who are you? Who are you? Who the fuck are you? Dear Lord... I'm John Douglas, the pastor of Celebration. "I'm John Douglas, pastor of Celebration." Cocksucker! Dear Lord, cast away any evil that harms this child, Ashley, or Tanya. Her soul is mine. Oh, my God! "Oh, my God!" Why hast thou forsaken me? You don't believe me. Help me, Tanya! Get her out of here. Get her out of here! We need to be alone with the demon. The only chance we have of learning the demon's name is to get her back to holy ground after she's sedated. I need you to hold her while I inject her. We will prevail with the power of the Lord. And if we do not? We will vanquish wavering assurances in the presence of the Lord, there is no doubt. Demon, in the name of Jesus Christ, I rebuke you and cast you away. Fuck... you. Ah! Don't throw my piss on me. God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and to Jesus Christ, his only son, our Lord, who was conceived of the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered unto Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead and buried. He descended into hell. The third day, he arose from the dead and ascended into heaven, and siteth upon the right hand of God! The power almighty. He shall come to judge the quick and the dead. Demon, you have no place here. I cast you! I submit to the will of God. I am God. You are a demon and a coward! And you hide in a child. You are a coward. In the name of Jesus Christ, I command you tell me your name. You are mistaken. She has invited me in. No! No! Get her away from him! John? John! Get the book. Get the book. In the name of Jesus Christ, tell me your name. Thy kingdom... I rebuke you, Satan, and all your dark angels, in the name of Jesus Christ. Tell me your name! I am the Lord. I will not fail to punish your children and grandchildren for the sins of their parents. I rebuke you, Satan, and all your dark angels, in the name of Jesus Christ. Tell me your name! Ashley? Ashley. Ashley, where are you? Ashley. Ashley? Tanya, please help me. I just want to go home. Okay. Come, come... It's okay. It's okay. Get her back to the church. Jordan. Jordan, you need to come home. Tanya, you shouldn't be here. I am not going anywhere. Then I have something to show you. May God bring you peace, Kyle. May God bring you peace, Ashley. May God bring you peace, Sarah.
