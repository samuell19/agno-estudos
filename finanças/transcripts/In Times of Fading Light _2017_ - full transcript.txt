When the potato leaves were burned in the field the days became shorter and the evenings cold Autumn had arrived and took over the land The people in Slava said: "It is the time of fading light. " In Times of Fading Light Berlin, capital of the GDR Come in. Sit down. Would you like some tea? I am not yet settled. I wanted to remind you about Wilhelm's birthday. Yes, that's what I thought. When is it? The day after tomorrow. - Mhm. It'll be in the newspaper. Do you have a lease or something? How did you end up here? Do you have a key? - I had a new lock put in. So you broke in here. - The place was empty. No one was looking after it. Melitta came to see us. We like her. I like her too. Then why did you leave her? We warned you not to marry a woman you hardly knew. You wanted it. You wanted a child. - You were right. If that's what you want to hear. Yeah, you were right. Your mother has had enough. She can't sleep. Don't blame me for her sleeplessness. How is your dissertation going? - It's not. Are you mad? You can't just throw everything away. - I don't know. I don't want to spend my whole life lying. - And I've been lying my whole life? Let's go eat. I don't want tea. Die Scharfe Ecke is gay. They only have bockwurst. Everything is shit. You're already in an unstable condition. You shouldn't make any decisions right now. - My head is clear. My head has never been so clear. Good, then do what you want. But it is too late. - Yes, it is. You're completely crazy. You live comfortably. Your mother got you two the apartment, I paid the car insurance. Here is the car key. People are starving elsewhere. Yeah, people are starving elsewhere. Your mother can't handle not hearing from you. You can't run away when your house is not in order. Your mother and I had to stick together. I'm not having any marital problems. If you had lived my life with your attitude, you would be dead now. Now it starts. - No, don't worry. No thanks. I don't need anything. Sons used to listen to their fathers. When there was something to listen to. Don't forget Wilhelm's birthday. The day after tomorrow. 90. - Yeah, I won't forget. Everything is shit. You're right. Take Gartenstrasse. - Off Leninstrasse? Yes. So not to Amselsteig. - To 18 Gartenstrasse. Hello, Vera. Umnitzer. He's not here yet. Yes, I know, Sascha has to set up the table. Mhm. Later, mom. Umnitzer. If he wanted to be there at 11, he would. Don't worry, mom. Yes. Irinushka. Irina. Yes, I'm coming. Yes? At least let us have breakfast in peace, Charlotte. Don't get so upset. I still have to get Wilhelm's present. Papyrossi cigarettes. He can't smoke anymore. - What else should one get him? What a beautiful day. We could go for a walk before the chaos. I'm having dumplings with Sascha. - You can do that as well. I could call Vera and see if she wants to go too. So you want to take a walk with Vera? That's not what I said. - Yes it was. Irina, Vera is your friend. - She never was. Umnitzer. You can't be serious. Can you tell me why? I said, can you tell me why? Who was that? Sascha. And? He's not coming. - What do you mean? He is over there. In Giessen, wherever that is. In the West. He is gone. He's known this for three days. He planned it all. Good morning. Make sure Sascha doesn't forget to take the pickles. Nadezhda Ivanovna, Sascha is not coming today. Doesn't matter, the pickles will keep. Nadezhda Ivanovna, please sit down. I don't want breakfast. Nadezhda Ivanovna. Sascha isn't coming back anytime soon. Is he sick? He is in the West. - In America? Not in America. In West Germany. West Germany? That is America. He's gone, Mom. He is dead. Do you understand? Dead. What does that mean, Irina? Sascha is not dead. Irina is trying to say that he is very far away. But he's coming back? Of course he's coming back. What did he tell you? Nothing. Only that we shouldn't blame ourselves. He didn't climb over or swim. It wasn't dangerous. Don't cry. He had a message for you: The morning is smarter than the evening. But I don't know what he means by that. You shouldn't be drinking, Irina. Especially today. Are all the vases labeled, so that you know who we borrowed them from? It's your birthday, Wilhelm. Happy Birthday. I know that it's my birthday. Exactly fifty years ago, we arrived in Mexico on your birthday. Yes. I've already looked through the newspaper. You're on page 2. On the front page, it says Marshal Volkov died in Moscow. I don't know him. "Mikhail Sergeyevich Volkov most recently led the anti-aircraft division. He died after a long sickness at age 78 in Moscow. The 79 year old Marshal Oleg Konstantinovich Taburio was named as his successor. " Both of them are younger than me. Don't forget to take your pills. I don't take any pills. You must take your pills. If you don't take your pills, I'm going to call Dr. Suess. If you call Dr. Suess then I'll say that you're poisoning me. There's nothing on them. - There's nothing on what? On the vases. I have more important things to do right now. Dammit. I said, the vases aren't labeled. Then label them. - Hello. I congratulate you, Wilhelm, and wish you many more years. Sorry for being late, Lotti. - There's nothing left for you to do. You shouldn't spend money on me, Lisbeth. Take that away. I'd appreciate them, but I can't smell them anymore. I'd like a coffee. Lotti won't like that. Your blood pressure. Make me some coffee. Too bad that you're dead. Come here. That is too much. Lisbeth. - Yes? If I die, she poisoned me. Wilhelm, how can you say that? - I said what I said. Thanks. Sascha can do that. - Sascha is not here yet. Who will set up the table? - Sascha, when he gets here. It was open. Can we come in? I hope we're the first. This is a nice tradition. Comrade Schlingen - Dear Comrade Powileit. This is Comrade Nolle, who will be taking care of the veterans from now on. I know, you don't feel so old. It's a pleasure to meet you. - Thanks. Take these vegetables to the cemetery. - Pay no attention to him. Dear Wilhelm, it is already a nice tradition, on this special day in your long life struggle to present greetings from the district and the party Are you going to be a while? Then I'm going to sit down. I am a little senile. But not totally senile. I still know what's going on. Going downhill. There are, frankly, problems. But we want to solve them. The district administration. - Everyone in their place. We are a stable state. We have relationships with 139 other countries. I was always against recognizing all those countries. Dear Comrade Powileit, for over seventy years you have been a favored son in the Communist Party. We're proud and happy to always have you in our ranks. Powileit residence. Yes. Yes? Hello. You're leaving now. Good. Thank you for the call. And please no paper plates. Sascha is still not here. But the buffet is still happening. The people are setting it up now. We need to have the table ready. - Normally, Sascha is on time. If he doesn't come... Or if he's unable... I just mean that I could come and set up the table. Of course, I will not let you down, Mom. No one will let you down. Please stay seated. I have to excuse myself. We are having a family party. I forgot our appointment. Comrade Powileit is turning 90. He is my mother's husband. My father, so to speak. Or better, my stepfather. I didn't know about the birthday. I had also sent you personal questions. Yes. I read them. Who is your professor? - Prof. Neuberg. He's good. But I have to ask you to come back another time. Thanks. "How did you live through the outbreak of the war?" Actually I don't feel like it today. My son has left the country. And he is not 20 years old, like you, but rather 32. Then I'll come back later. - Okay. But let's finish our tea. When the war began, my brother and I lived in Moscow. We were the children of immigrants. Our parents worked for the Soviets in another country. That is no longer a secret today. We joined willingly. Our enemy was Hitler. We got on a freight train. We were all Germans that wanted to fight against the Germans. The train traveled in the wrong direction for five days. Toward the east. When we were let off, we were in the forest. And we were prisoners. And remained prisoners. I spent ten years in the camp. And then I was still in exile. The place was called Slava. I was there until 1954. It's hard to believe now. - And then you came back to the GDR? Where else? Take a look. That's our wedding. My wife. She was 16 here. To capture in battle Primorye The stronghold of the White Army The banners were filled By the red of the last wounds Went the intrepid squadrons Of the Amur partisans Went the intrepid squadrons Of the Amur partisans We're proud to sing for you. - Thanks. Buy the children some ice cream. - I cannot accept that. This is my last birthday. - We'll take it for the class funds. Many thanks, Comrade Powileit. Be prepared! - Always prepared! I am also ready. Well done. I'll set up the table. Sascha should be here soon. Only Sascha can set up this table. We've often tried before. - Where is Sascha? Sascha is not here yet. - And there you have it. Unreliable. A mess as always. I'll set up the table. - You're not setting anyting up. You've broken enough things here. I'm a metalworker I've been in the party for 70 years. How long have you been in the party? Comrade Maehlich is here. - Hello. Greetings. As always, Wilhelm, in neighborly camaraderie. Lisbeth, take these vegetables to the cemetery. As always, my respects, Comrade Powileit. My wife is coming later. Help me set up the table. - Don't strain yourself It's going to be a long day. - Are you worried about me or the table? I'll help. Pull. It wobbles a bit. - Yes. Get a hammer and some nails. You know where. You know, this is a Nazi table. - Doesn't look like it. You can't drive any nails into that table. Why can't we do that? It is a Nazi table. That's what the neighbors told us. A big wig lived here. Gosh. - Like riding a bike. Sascha always had two more boards. - What boards? Two. Have we upset your wife? - Eh, whatever. What do you think about the political situation, Wilhelm? The problem is, that the problem is the problem. Chevs. All the Chevs. The problem is the Chevs. Understand? Chev, Chev. - Do you mean Gorbachev? I'm not naming names, but you might think so. Capitulators, double-tongues, gamblers... We used to know what to do with them. Should we ring? I think so. A delegation. Hello, your daughter... - I am the maid. Your maid let us in. - Welcome. I know you, if not by name. We are from the Wiesengrund dairy co-op. We congratulate you on your day of honor on behalf of the "Wilhelm Powileit" Brigade. Thank you, that's me. Please, have a seat. Thanks. Why are you all made up? Because we are going to your great-grandfather's. Not everyone has a great-grandfather. Will dad be there too? I don't think so, Markus. But maybe. I want him to be there. Irina. We're going to be late. I'm not going. It's not a birthday to me. We can't tell him anything about Sascha. We cannot spoil his day. - Your mother has never liked me. What does that mean? Today's not about her, but rather him. So I don't matter? Of course not. Why would I? Yes, you matter. You always matter. But I have to get through this too. Sascha is gone and I must put on a happy face. You never understood him. My problem is that I do understand him. Sascha takes completely after you. The Russians are different. They drink, but they don't run away. I'm still here. I am with you, and you are with me. And Nadezhda Ivanovna is with us. I love you, Irushka. I don't want to live without tenderness. Sorry, dear, I'm taking the bottle. When was Sascha ever tender? You were tender. We can get the things through the window. Here is the order, here is the bill. And we'll tabulate drinks at the end. Excuse me. Can you not silence your dog? I've tried. He either smells the food or doesn't like the delivery men. Be quiet! There are fewer chicken legs. Instead, we have 120 meatballs. The small ones are better than the big ones. And porcelain plates, as requested. Happy birthday. - Who are you? Your longtime admirer. Your neighbor, my wife. Take these vegetables to the cemetery. Who are you? - Mrs. Becker. The greengrocer. Ah, yes. Harry Zenk. The new rector of the academy for administration. I've never been to your birthday. - Welcome. I am the section commissioner. - Welcome, Comrade. Always in service. But not today. Take these vegetables to the cemetery. Wait a minute, I know you. I am your doctor, Dr. Suess. My wishes are simple: Stay as healthy as ever, Comrade Powileit. I listen to doctors, but not too closely. Stalin was given bad treatment. On behalf of the Chekist collective, I congratulate you on your day of honor. Stay watchful with us for a long time. The enemy never sleeps. You're from security, Colonel. Or have you been promoted? It's okay. Everyone must only know what he needs to know. It's an honor. I don't want you. - But these are the Sondermanns. He who wants to leave the Republic, is a traitor. A boy can make a mistake. - I don't want you. Okay. Wait a moment. Just wait a moment. As if we had a family problem. As if our son were an exception. Rather, we have a political crisis. - Come have a coffee. Just with me. - It's so unjust. Leaving already? I must relieve my colleague. We're getting kohlrabi today. So, another beer? Yes. Please, where is the bathroom? - You're right in front of it. Water? - Please. Just wait a minute. No problem. I don't know what I should do anymore. I think he must go to a home. I know that you think that, but you need a strong case for that. I've loved him, believe me. I got divorced for him, with two young children. And that was in Ulm. He was the one who explained the world to me. But now he is writing silly letters to all sorts of institutions. I don't have the letters, but I have the replies. He complained about seeing a TV broadcast from the West. He wrote to security that the Sony TV like the one we have has an enemy component and always switches to the West's signals. Above all, he's always working on the house. He repairs unbroken things that then break. You should have seen how he put nails into the table. He put concrete over the terrace. Now rainwater runs into the conservatory. Bring your coffee. I'll show you. The only room I have to myself. My little Mexico. It's too humid for the cacti here. Yeah, that's frustrating. We were in Mexico. We were exiled. Eight years. Did you know that? - Of course I know that. We felt very strange here for a long time after we came back. Not because there were Nazis, but rather because there were none. Nobody had been there. Nobody had been for it. No one could remember. Can you tell me what that means? Or that over here? That is your strong case. Or not? Nadezhda Ivanovna. Are you coming to the birthday party? I'm going to bring Wilhelm a jar of pickles. Then let's go. I had a dream. I was just in Slava. The potato leaves were burning. As the days grew shorter. And colder. Where is Irina? Is she not well? - Yes. Because of Sascha? - Yes. Regardless, it's no reason to drink. It's not right for the woman to get drunk while the man is sober. But she smokes too. Let me introduce you. This is Comrade Krueger, the section commissioner. This is my wife. We've met before. - I don't recall. Sorry. Just a question: On Siebweg... the streetlights have not been on for days. Is that your responsibility? Not specifically, but I'll take care of it. I'd be very grateful. Yes. Sorry. To return... With a withered forehead The snow of time I clear it up on my temple To feel... That life is only a gust of wind That twenty years are nothing How feverish the look Unwavering in the shadows It searches for you and calls out your name To live... With the soul holding onto A sweet memory I weep for once again. How wonderful that you could come. How long have we known each other? 48 years. I have loved Wilhelm. It's as simple as that. I have told you that a hundred times. That doesn't matter. That is your story. When Hitler took over, Wilhelm decided to send the kids to Moscow. He had connections there. That was so hard for me. We were fighters. We were already living illegally. Wilhelm had an assignment he never talked about. Sometimes I think he might have helped assassinate Trotsky. But since then it apparently has been forgotten. No one reported to him. And today he gets the Golden Star of People's Friendship. What for? As compensation? When we came back, it turned out that we had escaped to the wrong country. For you at the theater, maybe that does not matter, but for him, the doors to certain opportunities were closed. He came from Mexico, not from Moscow. I thought, this would be a present for you both. Did you ever tell Wilhelm? - No. Carlos... the day before we left, he proposed to me. I did not know that. He should have proposed to me. Nice thought. Lotti. Lotti, are you coming? Wilhelm fell asleep. Wilhelm encouraged that, the proletarian informality. Wilhelm, you're asleep. Please continue, comrades. Did I miss something? We're still waiting for Comrade Juehn. Maybe our colleagues from the Brigade "Wilhelm Powileit", can report on what they're currently doing. I know a bit about that. You do it. I'm happy to report: We want to give French Brie a second home in Brandenburg. It is about minimizing the maturing time of the raw milk without losing the creamy consistency. That means not letting the cheese get hard. So it means more and better cheese. The goal is Eastern cheese that tastes like Western cheese. That is the task. He wanted to marry me. Who? - Pyotr Ignatyevich And when was this? When the Soviets came. When the Soviets came, you were just 10. No, I still remember... that was when my cousin killed the cows... because it was said that whoever has more than three cows, will be considered a Kulak. But then they considered him a Kulak anyway, because he killed the cows. You mean, they shot him? It must have been like that. That was a long time ago. And then you went to Slava? I was not against progress. But when they began to tear down the churches, that was a sin. But electricity, why not? And a school. Then we were moved to another village, because of Irina. In which village? You don't know? You mean Slava? Of course Slava, what else? Why are you so late? Where is Irina? - She is sick. What does she have then? - She's not well. And where is Sascha? - Mom, we have to talk about Sascha. I'm slowly going mad here. It's such a scandal. Juehn isn't coming, only the deputy secretary. Wilhelm is receiving the Golden Order at 90. They're sending the deputy and he's is late. Please Kurt, don't mention certain events. You know already, in Hungary or Prague, and nothing about the Soviet Union. And nothing about Poland. - Yes. I mean, no. Nothing about Space, Nothing about the Moon. Nadezhda, Wilhelm will be so happy to see you. Wilhelm has gotten worse recently. Where are your flowers? Shit, I left them at home. - There are plenty here. Take some. Why does this smell so much like mothballs? Take the coat to the basement. There's no room here. Welcome, Nadezhda Ivanovna. Welcome! Dear Wilhelm, take these pickles... as a present. Very well. I congratulate you as well. Stay healthy and stay faithful. Without you, I would be a Bavarian lawyer. - That would be bad. Can you open the pickles? Where is Sascha? - He's coming later. Please, have a seat. Good, good. This is Markus. Your great-grandson. - Just a moment. If you are my great-grandson, I must have a grandson. Isn't that Sascha? I am his mother. Melitta. - Yes, I know. Markus painted you a picture. Do you want to show him? He's very interested in animals. That is a dinosaur. How old are you, my boy? - Eight. When I die, you will inherit an Iguana. He is from Mexico. Lisbeth, go get him. Shall we say hello to everybody? Hello. - Hello. Hello. Hello. - Hello. Hello. - Hello. How long do Iguanas live? - I believe they live very long. Not this one. I caught him myself. With my own hands. Do you want him? Yes, please. Say thanks, Markus. - Thanks. How are you. Melitta? You look good. You too. Alonso! Stop it! Alonso! Come! Be quiet now! Alonso! Stop it! Comrade Tabbert is here. Sorry for being late. Would you like a glass of wine? Thanks. First work, then fun. But in this case, dear Comrade Powileit, the work is fun. Who are you? I don't know you. Comrade Juehn is indisposed, unfortunately. Soon I will be, too. "Dear Comrade Powileit, Your special birthday today is an occasion to look back on your lifelong struggle. After a metalworking apprenticeship, at the age of 20 you joined the Communist Party of Germany in the year it was founded, and joined the Alliance of Red Front Fighters a little later. You became a man during the class struggles in the Weimar Republic and an outlaw when fascism came to power in Germany. Your exile in Paris, followed by your distant exile in Mexico until you came back after the defeat of fascism to help build the German Democratic Republic. For many years, your dear wife, our comrade Charlotte, selflessly put aside her own career and stood by your side. If I may say so. "Your rich experience and strong commitment to the cause have served you well, most recently as cadre leader in the state car factory. " That's my life. Dear Comrade Powileit, you helped establish a new order in which money doesn't control everything, and justice has a place is everyday life and where, as a great poet once said, "a man can be a brother to every man. " That's my life. But it was not like that. Thanks. The Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic award Wilhelm Powileit the Golden Star of People's Friendship. Thanks. Thanks. I already have enough tin. The buffet is ready. It's easy to overeat. I used to be an athelete. Now, in the Ministry, I've doubled in weight. That goes for everyone: too little exercise, despite all the Olympic medals. Should we sit in the garden? - Sure. Or eat first? - No. I am Zenk, the new Rector here. I'm pleased to meet you. I am curious about your work on the German judicial system. The hasty process in the Nazi era: 30,000 death sentences, and no judge was prosecuted. Most of these criminals remained in office. Yes, we certainly don't want to forget that. Your book about Hindenburg is required reading for us. I'm pleased. I remember a story about Hindenburg. A colleague told Max Liebermann quite flatteringly that he should paint the President. To which Liebermann replied: "Hindenburg? I'll piss it in the snow. " Wonderful. Tell me, did Liebermann mean that it was not difficult to paint Hindenburg Or that one shouldn't take pride in it? A bit of fine political irony, I think. Wonderful. Uh... there was something I didn't understand. Your comment about being a Bavarian lawyer. My biological father was a Bavarian lawyer. Because of Comrade Powileit and the economic crisis my mother divorced him and became a communist. - Wonderful. Comrade Powileit wants to say something. I just lost my train of thought. Take your time, Comrade Powileit. When an old man looks back on his youth and life and finds it meaningful, is one not happy? Is that not happiness? We should be jealous, Comrade Powileit. Ah, now I remember. In Hamburg, I had a room on the harbor and a pistol. A Korovin 6.35mm, Soviet model. I was waiting for the Gestapo to find me. But I was lucky. Others did not have such luck. They put their asses on the line and got killed for it. We weren't prepared. And now we're not prepared again. Once my grandmother had a little gray goat Indeed, Indeed Gray goat Grandmother's goat Where is Irina? She's not feeling well. I think I should have told you: Sascha is in the West. I know that. - You knew that already? I knew that already. Not when it would happen, but how it would. It was a diplomatic car. - Why didn't you discuss it with me? It was too difficult for him. He couldn't blame you for your life. It's just not the life for him. And his mother? She gave birth to him in Russia. And before that, she took me in from the cold. When and where and how did his life begin? Why did he move into that apartment? So that I wouldn't know anything if I were questioned. And when you came to us, as if you two had marital problems, was that an act? Yes, but... I still wanted to see you. And we did still have problems. Vodka! Vodka! Grandmother loved her gray goat so dearly Sorry, I have to go. - I'll show you out. Vodka! Vodka! She took him for a walk It's always nice, when we're all together. Yes, that's certainly true. Vodka! Vodka! Vodka! Vodka! Vodka. Vodka. Pretty song. Yes, yes. But "vot kak ", which means "indeed ". Vodka! Vodka! Grandmother loved her gray goat so dearly She took him for a walk in the woods Vodka! Vodka! There the goat was eaten by gray wolves Vodka! Vodka! Gray wolves... Sascha thought you were a superhero. He wanted you to write down your life story. Perhaps you will be too old to do so soon. That's what he said, not me. There will be no more great ideas in this century. How could somebody leave you? Could you explain that? No. Vodka! Vodka! I saw that coming. That wasn't me. I wanted the little sausages. Markus. Sorry, Charlotte. He's a bit clumsy. You have nothing to apologize for. That's on Wilhelm. This is all Wilhelm's fault. - Come here. Come. Please don't knock, ring the bell. The table just collapsed. I brought what I always bring, Wilhelm. I'm not supposed to smoke anymore, but I'll smoke these. Thanks, Irina. Thanks. Where is Sascha? I'll tell you where Sascha is. Wait, Irina, wait. I'll tell him myself. He is my son. I know him better than you do. I've always known him better than you have. Dear friends and comrades, our son Sascha is no longer here. He has left the Republic. Simply put, he has fled. Comrade Powileit, stay as you are, above all, healthy. I am Irina. Irina Umnitzer. Listen to a Russian mother! There's no one I listen to with more respect than a Russian mother. We are losing the future. Whoever loses their children, loses the future. We have one pair of shoes for summer and winter, but we carried on. We had little bread, but we triumphed. We had no matches, nor soap. The shops were empty. But we went to space. I didn't benefit from that, but I also didn't want anything for myself. Those are big questions. Where can we speak, Comrade? - In the kitchen. Or in Wilhelm's study. It's okay. It's okay, Irina. Don't let anyone in. I can't tell you much. - I know. We are speechless. Not just you. People are running away and we don't say anything about it. I would not want to run away now either. Did you read my file? Yes. I was in a camp for 10 years. I can live with that. But Sascha couldn't. Did you ever think that the counter- revolution would come from the Soviet Union? If that were so, then they've already won. Because the Soviet Union is invincible. Isn't your son at Humboldt University? Yes. And he had just dropped his dissertation. Come to my office tomorrow morning. Or go to Juehn. At eight o'clock. Please don't get upset, Comrade Powileit. I'm not surprised. You're defeatists, this whole family. Maybe not Irina, She struggled in the War. But Kurt and his brother were in the forest, chopping down trees. I've explained to you how it was when we were chopping down trees. Half the men died. My brother died, without reason. He died. Did you ever want to know that, Wilhelm? Once my grandmother had a little gray goat Indeed, Indeed Gray goat Irina. Say goodbye to Grandma. - Goodbye, Grandma. Goodbye, Markus. Why are you leaving, just when I got here? It's going to take us an hour to get home. - I want to speak with you. Markus, go over to Aunt Stine and wait a moment, will you? You've been growing a lot. Sascha knew how to set up the table. Did you love him enough? Do that at home. - It looks sloppy. Good that you could come, comrades. Solidarity. I imagined the day would be more pleasant. Is everyone leaving? - Yes, everyone's leaving. There were always special circumstances. Every year there was a different one. And we overcame them. - That's what we're here for. I grew up Soviet. Where can I go? Why are the children running away from us? What are we leaving behind for them? What's missing for them? What do they want? Is there still a plan for the world or... Or is it just jeans and Kalashnikovs? Sascha said: "When you don't have bread, you can eat potatoes. But when the ideas are gone, what then?" Do you ever think about growing old? Should I stay and help? - No, we've got it. I don't think we should wake Comrade Powileit to say goodbye. Who of us understands life, Comrade Irina? If you have any financial problems, I will, of course, take care of them. Can I still take the iguana with me? - We'd better ask. Even if Great-Grandpa isn't dead yet? Take it, or else you'll never get it. Your great-grandpa is too old to die. Why did you stay? I don't want to leave. Maybe because I'm a doctor. Because Markus is only eight. Where would he stay if we got caught? You have a family. - I want that, too. Who answers, you or me? It doesn't matter. Come. Irina will also be happy. Is there anything to drink here? - There's wine everywhere. I don't want any wine. - There's the fridge. At least you came home. - What are you talking about? You were in Prague and in Vienna and in Paris. And in Mexico. And now you are back here, and are home. How do you know that? - Cheers. Vodka is the soldier's friend. Stop drinking, Irina. We must talk about Sascha. I know you can't stand me, Charlotte. Maybe because I drink. Or because I'm from the village. Maybe because your other son stayed there. But now I've also lost a son. I don't want to hear about that anymore. Please not! Please not today. We have to stay together. - It's not the same. I know. They beat him to death. My brother froze to death next to me. Peacefully in his sleep. But that's what you told me, that they beat him to death. There was an order to quickly lay all the dead in a row. And the guards hit them in the head with a hammer. So that no one could play dead in order to run away. I wanted to forget it. I wanted us all to forget it. What you can not talk about, you must be silent about. Then why are you talking about it? Where are you, my heart? Suliko? I asked The wind and the clouds They said you are nowhere My eyes were blind with tears I only found your grave Suliko That was Stalin's favorite song. Maybe you shouldn't drive. I'm going to get myself a dog. Bye, mom. Bye. We haven't had a chance to talk. - Yes, that's a shame. Come have a seat with me. You know me so much better than anyone else. I'll start, Lotti. - Are you not taking a vacation first? And don't call me Lotti. - Sorry, Lotti. Well this is a surprise. Where is my lighter? I could get down and look, but I couldn't get back up again. There. You shouldn't smoke, Wilhelm. I would've liked to have had a different life. I said there should have been names on the vases. Who knows whose vase is whose now? I want to go home. Oh, sorry, we forgot about you, Nadezhda. That was Kurt. He brought you here too. Lisbeth, can you try to call a taxi? - I'll do it! You'll be home soon, Nadezhda. Home is Russia. That is far. But here I can walk. It's not far. The taxi will be here soon. Wait here. The table can be fixed. - You stay out. You've already done enough damage. I said: "Take your finger off the table. " - I know, Sascha would do it. And where is your Sascha? Politically unreliable. They already know why. They know it. They know why. - Why what? Why they locked such people away. Such as your sons. You must drink your tea. - I'm not drinking your tea. I'm not drinking the tea. I have my reasons. We don't need you anymore. - Then I get paid for coming out here. Lotti? Sorry. - It's fine. It happens. What now? You go home. - But Lotti... Don't call me Lotti, or I'll call the police! Wilhelm? Wilhelm? You can come! Yes? Why would he be with me? Irina? Of course I can come right away. But what's wrong? Hello? Irina? Mama is gone. What do you mean, "she is gone? " - She is not here. Then she is still at Charlotte's. Have you called? Charlotte didn't answer. Mama? Nadezhda Ivanovna? You took her. But unfortunately, you found no time to bring her home. Unfortunately. Nadezhda? Nadezhda Ivanovna? I'll walk over. - Do that. Mama? Nadezhda Ivanovna? Mama? Slava, 1991 Nadezhda Ivanovna always wanted to see Slava again. Irina drove with her. It was in autumn. It was the time of fading lights. Inexorably, autumn was followed by winter. Sascha also came. He had stopped studying history. We had the ability to believe. We believed that what we wanted, would become as we wanted it. Have we ruined everything?
