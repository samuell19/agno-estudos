Come here. Come on with your hands up! Save yourself. I'm gonna take you out of here. No, just go. Please, before ... Before... Stay. Put your hands up! What the ... Good. You are awake. Who the hell are you? What do you mean? Where am I? Do not you remember? No... Not of it? I'm sorry. I have no idea who you are or how I got here. I'm Alana. So, what's the last thing you remember? I ... I was in the hospital. That was a week ago. - A week? - Yes. We've lunch this morning. Magnets. Hello? Is no one out there. Hello? I told you. What is this? You must remember being sentenced. Sentenced? - What are you talking about? - The court sentencing. It doesn't make any sense. Does this control door? You're not making any sense. It's not letting you out. Welcome Isaac Haveloc It's new. Ain't did that for me. What the ... Hi, Isaac. My name is Eva. I'm your emergency assistant. You're a computer? Yes. You said emergency? Yes. Where are we? You are aboard of your habitation capsule... approximately 150 miles above the surface of the earth. Space? Yes. I a... there... There must be some mistake. They... They must have confused me with someone else. Are you not Isaac Havelock? Yes, but ... You were selected to be part of the Samsara program which aims to build earth's first colony by the year 2052. The mission is due to departure earth's orbit in 11 hours. once all the orbitation pods are docked. - When this docking is happening? - We have already docked. Okay, great ... So how we get out here and talk to someone? I'm sorry, but you can not open the air locks unless the ship is docked. But you just said we're docked, so, how can't we open the door? We are no longer docked. Why? I'm sorry, that my systems are only activated during the emergency separation. Therefore, I'm unable to provide information proceeding out that. Emergency what? Emergency other than be trapped in this room. An emergency occurred aboard on the ship. I have no further information. Then, and why don't I remember all this? Atmosphere pressure in the capsule dropped to 15%. Mild symptoms of hypoxia include temporary loss of memory, motor skills ... Lack of concentration, poor judgment ... Do you understand any of this? I woke up just before you. So... how can we walk around without ... You know... floating. Gravity is regulated using polarized magnets in the floor and ceiling All participants are issued with magnetic implants. Like I said, magnets. Liquids, are not subject to gravity controls, however, the vacuum system creates negative... Why me? I do not know. What is it? Look. Oh my God... Hey, stop that. Is that ... or was that the ship? I think it was. Breathe. How can you be so calm? We're still here. Eva? Yes, Isaac? Can we communicate with the ship? Yes, Isaac. Who would you like to speak to? Pass through to the... The bridge? Yes. Sure. Sorry, the call failed. Would you like to try the medical bay? Sure. Call failed. Would like to... Just try every pod of the ship until you get answer. Sure. Sorry. All calls failed. What about the ground? Who do you want to call? Ground control. A moment. Connecting you now. Hello, Jane speaking? Yes. Thank God. Oh, yes, hi! This is Isaac Havelock. - There has been some sort of ... - Who do you like to speak to? Is it the ground control? No, this is the main switchboard. Would you like to put you through someone in the control team? - Yes! - Yes! One moment. Thank you. I'm sorry, but I can reach anyone. it's really busy down there. Can I take a message and pass it on to someone that can give you a call back? What? No, we need to speak to someone right now. This is literally a matter of life or death! I'm sorry, sir, I can't reach them. One moment. I've got someone. Putting you through. Hello? To whom am I speaking? Sir, this is Isaac Havelock. We are on board in a capsule, and separated of the main ship. Isaac. There is been an explosion. We are not sure of the status of Vega 3 or its crew is. Hang in there. We're doing everything we can. Okay but... We can't see through our monitor right now. Can you tell me what you see outside of the window? Isaac? Isaac, wake up. What happened? Another explosion. Control? Gone. You have used one of your ten calls this month. Inbound and outbound calls count toward your allowance. Calls may be monitored by staff for violations. I know. We're lucky if we last a week. Impact detected. What does that mean? That something just hit the ship. - A drop in the pressure has been detected. - Calm down. We need to focus. Eva, do you know the leak is coming from? Unknown. Water flows in microgravity. Atmospheric pressure is currently at 96 percent and falling. - There. - Eva, how do you fix this? Minor hull damage can be sealed using the emergency repair kit located below the gardens and the blowtorch mounted on the wall. Eva, how big the impact can this thing take? Object smaller is 10 mm ... at a maximum rate of 8,000 meters per second. That is bigger than a centimeter. - You okay? - I'm hit. A second leak has been detected. It's a lot bigger. Thanks we don't sleep through. Atmospheric pressure stabilized. How is it? I'll be okay, it's not too deep. Lucky. Then I would like to know what is bad luck. Incoming calls from control. Skill, Haveloc, are you there? Hello. Still here. We lost you for a bit there. I have some bad news. The ship is gone. There may be other survivors, but we do not know how many right now. Gone? Do you know what happened? I... do you know, we must be sleeping. Still don't know. How're you doing to get us out of here? We're working on it. Do not worry. We'll get you out. Who's worrying? You are. Hello? Listen, Your capsule is currently falling out of orbit. Without adjustment, you will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. That sounds good to me. No, it is not good. We do not know if your capsule will survive re-entry due the possible damage sustained in the explosion. Are you there? What do you want us to do? Stand by for instructions. We're working on it. So, you said. In the meantime try to conserve your air. Don't breathe too deeply or quickly. Try not to panic. Call failed. Why would we panic? You have used two of your ten calls this month. Inbound and outbound calls count toward your allowance. Calls may be monitored by staff for violations. Eva, do me a favor, and don't be on that again. OK, Isaac. Why you won't tell me? Sorry? You're so calm. Why do I get the feeling that something you know that I don't? I do not know. It sounds more like your problem than my problem. Funny. So what did you do? Someone did something to me ... so I did something to him. Incoming call. Hello, to whom am I speaking, please? This is Isaac Havelock. Hey, Isaac. This is KNL News. Are you okay? We heard about an explosion up there. Yes, we're fine. How did you get through? We have our sources. Oh we are glad to hear that. My name is Lucy James, I'm a researcher with KNL. Would like to speak to us on air? Not really. Great, I'm patching you through right now. - But I... - Isaac? This is Ken Bradley with KNL News. You're live on the air. Hey, Ken. Is really great to hear your voice. Ah, now... You're the first person we're heard from up there. Can you tell us what happened? Isaac? - Hey! - Hello, Isaac? C'mon. Yes, still here. Good, good. Ah, yes, we got you back. You are going to tell us what happened? I was asleep. And then I woke up and something was hit the ship. And then there was a big explosion outside. My gosh, that doesn't sounds right. It's serious indeed. Do you know the condition of the rest of the crew is? I'm afraid, I have no idea. That must be very difficult. Well, our thoughts are with you right now. You are incredibly brave. Do you mind to tell us how do you deal with the psychological toll on the huge risks involved in a long-distance space flight? I honestly don't have answer for that right now. I understand. What is the plan for your recovery now? You know as much as I do. Control is trying to figure out what happened ... and we hope to hear from them soon. Well, in the case, we will... we leave there, and we will keep you, thank you. - We will speak soon, and good luck. - The call ended. That was a huge mistake. I remember everything. Do you? I didn't mean to do. Do what? I shot a man. Didn't meant to kill him, he died. I've heard it before. What do you mean? You just don't want to take responsibility for your actions. So, you are scared of how it will perceive you? No, I really didn't mean to. That doesn't make you a bad person. Trust me, I know. What? Why do you think I'm here? We are just criminals to them. It doesn't make any sense if we were criminals. They only separate men and women? Why do they put us together? Is it not obvious? Well ... that's not happening. Don't you find me attractive? No, I think you're very attractive. But I'm already with someone. Really? Take a look around, Isaac. You might change your mind. Do not worry. I'm only messing with you. You could tell me what you did. Maybe later. So, Chris ... What's the latest developments? Well, not much right now. We've got an official statement saying has been an incident And that they are working on was happened and what state to the crew is. Well, we will keep an eye for that. Now, if you have told me ten years ago that we would be sending prisoners into space, I would have called you mad. What do you think about it? That was proved was a bad idea? Well, that was been unsaid. How we treat our prisoners reflects on how we're doing as a society. And our prisons are full. Conditions are terrible ... And that is because we look at the big picture. Global population has exploded. The climate is a disaster and earth is in a state of upheaval We need to colonize other planets to survive, so in that sense, don't you think it gives meaning to prisoners lives that would otherwise be spent in a cramped cell? It is an important noble cause. So this program is very important. But if these people don't choose to, it's certainly incredibly risky, as demonstrated by what is going wrong. We... If how we treat our prisoners reflects how compassioned we are ... but this doesn't reflect badly? There are stacks of people who give their right arm enter space. This is an opportunity to dying for. It's why I aim... You almost have convinced me there. But ask yourself this: Why was it done in secret? And why wasn't done by consent? And why we only find that now that something has gone terribly wrong. Well, the Ministry of Justice told us this morning that they have specifically selected prisoners who was assessed to be quote-unquote: "psychologically suitable" for the mission. And the justice system was the ideal way to assess many applicants with the primary requisite posted on the situation. But I suppose they mean, no ties. All right, I hear you. And now for a quick news update. Billionaire inventor Robert Themis and his company Hyperion have offered the company's help in rescuing the stranded crew. Mr Themis, Mr Themis, you said in your post that your company wants to help and is ready to go. What did you mean by that, exactly? Yeah, We've actually been developing some scape pods for this exactly situation for NASA and we've got an unmanned capsule waiting for launch. We can get up there, get a pilot and bring this crew safely back to home. OK, presumably it will be good enough for each of the survivors. Well, It actually can hold two, but we can only dock one craft per flight, so we need to do runs which can take... many days or we can get several going in a once. - How many do you have, exactly? - We have got several. Well, some people out there are just saying, "this is another publicity stunt". Is it? No. Thank you for your time. Sorry, but you used up your 30 minutes of TV viewing for today. Too much television is bad for your health. Who cares about the news anyway? Money, death, the environment, blah blah blah. Incoming call. - Skill, Havelock, is the control. - Finally. Havelock, what was that? Sorry, what? Told you. Why did you talk to the media? That was very insensitive and ill-advised. You're kidding, right? We're trapped in this box about to die and you're having a go at me about talking to the media. We're trying to figure out what is happening. - This is live situation and -- - Who even are you people ?! Is it all about public perception issues? Do you give a fuck about us at all?! Are you even listening to me ?! Tamper or temper Isaac, I'm sorry. We are in crisis mode here and tempers are running high. Let's start again. We need to control what information is in the public domain right now to know for the sake of the families of the crew. OK Sir, I got it. Thank's, Isaac. So, what do we do now? The reason I called you actually ... is that it is critical we put you back into a stable orbit. Not just for your sake, but for people on the ground. That thing most likely won't break up in the atmosphere. In fact, is designed for re-entering in an emergency and has parachutes. But we don't know the state of your heat shields are after the explosion and in any case, the re-entry angle needs to be controlled. Okay, what do we need to do? OK, listen carefully. We gonna talk through how to manually pilot the capsule back into orbit. We're listening. Good, do you see the control panel? Yes. Good. Go to it, wake it up, navigate to "Systems". - Yep. - "Advanced". - Yep. - "Trust Control". - "Manual override". - Okay. You need enter the following code: "VCYD-1-9". Okay, done. Now you need to open open "Trust vectoring" and type the following commands: Under altitude, enter "Negative 11". Under seconds, enter "4". Under power, enter "80%". Got it. Okay, stand by the burning in 10 seconds. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five... four, three, two, one... Incoming call. Havelock, Skill. Yep? I see the burning went well, which is great! Well done. Sorry we lost contact for a bit, but you did a great job and you're in a good spot for the time being. - Thanks. - How you holding up? Guys, can you hear me? We hear you. It's done. What to tell you? I get it, it must be hard. Don't worry. We're doing everything we can. The room is hectic at the moment. We get the night shift and the helps of double the amount of people than normal. And we've got people from NASA and the military. The greatest minds in the country are working in how to get you back safe-- What exactly is the problem? Why can't' we just turn this thing around, pull the parachute, and pick us up from the ocean? Right now we can't risk anything until we know everything. I'm not a propulsion expert or an engineer, I'm just a medic. And your welfare is my priority. So you're a medic? What is your specialty? Psychology actually. But I have a general medical training applicable to space flight. Let's change the subject, shall we? Either of you has anyone significant back home? A Girlfriend or a boyfriend perhaps? - No. - Not anymore. Kids? No. No. - Close friends there? - No really. - No. - Family? Look. What is this exactly? You Are evaluating us. - Isacc I just-- - Do you have a girlfriend / boyfriend / family? - Well ... Actually not really. - Not really? No. Do you have a family? Yes. Are you are reading yourself a paper? Sorry. Favor to ask. What? You are able to tell me anything more about what happened up there? No, look, we've been through this. This won't gonna help us at all. We need to know is what you're doing to get us out of here. That's gonna help us. No going around in a loop with the same thing. I know. We're working on it. The whole control room is. But this can might help things. What happened up there? One of you must know something. We were both sedated. What? Who woke up first? - Isaac woke up first. - Wait. No, you woke up first. What are you talking about sedated? I thought we were just... oxygen-deprived or something. Everyone is sedated during lift-off until they dock with the main ship. Keeps stress levels down. Hello? I've just been told the capsule is about to pass behind the earth. Great! Power levels on board are low. They recharge by the solar panels, and you'll be in the shadow of the earth for 45 minutes. Meaning? We may lose radio contact for a while. Get some sleep. Bye. Call terminated. Why did you lie to them? I didn't. You woke up first. But that's not true. Yes, it is. Warning, power level at 9% and falling. What happens if we lose power? Lighting, heating, voice assistant ... communication and propulsion will be unavailable. Mag gravity life support systems will switch to auxiliary power. Is there anything we can do about it? No. Then we better sleep. Eva, turn the lights. Sure, Isaac. Incoming call from control. Skill, Havelock, can you hear us? Guys, we are standing by here for you. Alana? Isaac? Can you hear us? Guys? Are you there? Guys. Capsule 471, please wake occupants. Isaac? Alana? Control is calling. Can you hear us? Yep. Still here, apparently. We thought we lost you there for a bit. It is so cold. We think are maybe a power fault on board ... because those batteries should've have lasted the dark period. They should recharge now that you are in the sunlight, but you have another one coming up in 40 minutes so we should expect it to happen again. I just want to go home. Do you have any plans to get us home yet? We're working on it, Isaac. Come on, it's been hours. You must have a plan by now. We're close, Isaac. Just finishing up the details. I'll be back to you shortly. Call terminated. Alana? What? You're awake? I never slept. Incoming call. Isaac, hello, it's KLN News again. Sorry, but I'm not suppose to talk to you. Of course you aren't. And why that might be, Isaac? Because these are the instructions that control gave me... to be fair with the families of the crew on board the ship. You were in the army, weren't you, Isaac? Don't want to talk about that. I won't did if I was in your shoes. Unfortunately, the truth is out. Would you like to tell to the ladies and gentlemen listening what you did before you join the mission. - Not really. My private life is private. - I'm afraid it isn't. No one is funded by public parts and respectfully. Do you deny that you killed the man ... - after you left the military? - Where did you get that from? Just answer the question, please,Mr Havelock. Did you kill or did you not kill a man? - I shot a person, yes, but-- - Exactly, good. Now we're going somewhere. So how can we trust you when you've committed such a serious offense? Luckily you're not up here, so you don't have to worry. You could be flippant Mr. Havelock, but you'll have a case in accord of public opinion You killed a man being and don't seem particularly contritious. The public wants to know why. Why should you be saved? Don't you think the real question is: Is it right to send people on a one-way journey against their will? we get rid of the death penalty years ago. No, I don't actually. I think the question is: given that yours is the only surviving capsule that we're aware of right now and you clearly had a motive and have killed before ... Did you have anything to do with the explosion that claimed the life of so many people? How dare you? We are stuck up here with a slim chance to make out alive and you seat there making rumors of how I might murdered all of those people! What kind of sick person are you? I'm sorry, Mr. Havelock, but that is our view. Best of luck to you, anyway. Time to take some quotes from you out now. Kevin? Call terminated. What did you expect? - I can kind of see, actually. - What ?! You killing someone. I'm not like you. Of course you are. We are the same, you and I. Why do you think you're are here? Shut up! You gonna make me? - So you're a ex-army, aren't you? - Don't talk to me right now. I am interested. Really? So what happened? Clara had a gambling problem. Clara your bride? She was borrowing money of this guy that I used to work with. Ex-forces. Not someone you would mess about without having a reputation. He was treating her for the money so I sent her away to let it blow over. And I had to agree to work for him to pay off her debt. See, I actually had a need to rough off his promises. I knew he was never gonna let us off the hook, so one day I told him I was done. "Piss off." And it went quiet for a while ... Thing didn't stay away for long. You know why I'm here. And you know what you got to do. I can't do it. I'm paying the money, I told him. I'll pay the money. It's too late for now. Pick it up. See, we know where you were hiding her. So, you go now, or she dies. We'll be there at three. Do you have them? You're shaking. Do you have the money? Yes I have. - Have you? - No. I can't let you leave. You do this for him. Not for him. They're sending you away for this. It's just a flesh wound. I've seen a lot of those. Put a pressure on it. You'll be alright. The prisoner will stand up. Isaac Havelock. You have been found guilty of the manslaughter of Richard Adams, on April 14, 2044, in contravention of the common law. In mitigation, you've stated that you were coerced into this robbery by a third party. During the robbery, Mr. Adams failing to obey an instruction took a threatening approach to you You then shot him in self-defense. Do you stand by this statement? I did, but I did not kill him. Very well. This court recognizes this was not a premeditated crime. And that you have shown remorse, however, it does not accept your appeal for self-defense, as no weapon was found on Mr Adam's body. But it was right there. I told you. Someone must have moved it. Stay silent, Mr. Havelock. The court recognizes your distinguished military service to this country, and giving you consideration to the mitigating factors, The court finds itself able to offer you a second chance and you will be sentenced accordingly. Isaac Havelock, you will be taken from this court for transportation to the colonies. There you will serve the duration of your sentence. - Please ... - Silence! Remove the prisoner. Are you looking for sympathy? No. Good. A personal call? Yes, if don't mind. Hey, is Clara, leave a message. Damn it. Hi Clara, is Isaac. I'm sorry that almost break in. You probably thinking that I just stopped doing that. But I promise it wasn't like that. They threatened to hurt you and I couldn't see anything bad happening to you. Long story short, I was arrested and sentenced to the colony. Something bad happened. I just want you to hear I'm OK. Isaac, I'm here. I'm fine, by the way. Hey. Is great to hear your voice. I saw it over the news. They said you volunteered. That's not true. Any one wonders how they managed that. To get so many volunteers for one way trip. They didn't? No. Did you kill that man? Yeah, I shot him for a blood briefcase. But I didn't meant to do. I wish you hadn't. Me too. But I would do again if I had to. What was in the case? Does it matter? No, no, because I... matter. Well, the bright side if I don't get back is that no one needs to get through this. That's not funny. It was cash, For what it worth. Oh ... To pay the debt? Didn't you wonder? I... I knew that something had to do with you. I just... I feel so guilty. Just tell me what I can do, and I'll call someone or ... - I do not know ... - Don't. I'm were meant to be. Please, Isaac. Just... Hold on while they figure it out Listen. I'm really glad I met you. Me too. I talk to you in a little bit, yeah? Yeah, sure.. Love you. Bye. Cute. That was your babe, hein? You know a full about me ... I know nothing about you. What do you mean? Kipping eyes from outside over me. Is anything you talk me a truth? Were you even attacked? Yes. You're telling me that why you are here? for self-defense? Not exactly. Why, than? Why are you really here for? - Do you really wanna to know? - Yeah. I'm an addict. Where addicts go? Where do you think you're going? Do not kill me. Get out of there. It's alright Lian? Done with that? That's for screw my mind of. Call up to shit. You killed four people because you didn't like the drugs they were selling? - You killed someone for a briefcase. - I did not kill him. Whatever. He died. You're a soldier, you know how it feels like. Killing is my drug. It's not like anyone miss them. They were addicts. You're telling me you enjoyed it? Didn't you? No. That's the best drug. You know it is. It is most addictive. You don't want to admit it, because you're scared of me. I'm not scared of you. Sure. You can keep lying to yourself if you want to ... but I know you got a kick out of killing those people. You're just afraid that if you admitted it to yourself, you'll become like me. The truth is, you're already like me. We both killed ... we both enjoyed it. We are the same, you and I. Whatever. - Incoming call from the control. - Skill, Havelock, are you there? Where else would we be? We are nearly ready to bring you back. There's just one issue. We know that one of you boarded the ship before the explosion. Get of me! What's happening? Please Stop it! Just... Just leave me alone! Step away from each other. I just said, I'm not near her. He did it! He blew up the ship and now he's trying to kill me to stop me to talking. - She's lying, don't listen to her. - It's true. - Alana, are you okay? - Please! - One more word and I swear ... Please! Why did you put me in the same cell as this monster? - You're the monster. - Isaac, if Alana comes to hurt ... we'll be forced to abandon the rescue attempt. Is that understood? - Yes. - Call terminated. What did you do? You just set me out. - It wasn't difficult. - Why? You're my ticket out of here. That's why you're still alive. You blew up the ship. It's beautiful, isn't it? - You murdered all those people. - I had to. - You've killed us. - We're not dead yet. If they think either one of us is responsible for that, they never going to rescue us. - Of course, they will. - Why would they do that? To save the helpless woman of course. Don't you see? I've saved you from a life of slavery in the colony. And killed the future of humanity in the process! The future of humanity? Humanity is already dead, if they think sending us up here is a way to save it. Don't tell me you believe that bullshit. Who are you calling? I'm Isaac Havelock's cellmate. Do you want to know what he did? Stop it. You are live on KLM Radio. What's your name? - I'm Alana Skill. - What do you want to tell us, Alana? My cellmate Isaac just confessed that he was the one who blew up the ship. - What? - She's lying! God! Is it Isaac in the background we can hear? He wants the world to know what he did. He wants the program to be dismantled. Are you talking freely, Alana? Alana? Please help me. That wasn't very gentleman me. So weak. But it's OK. How did you do it? Fire detected in the oxygen garden. Eva ... Do something. Fire-extinguisher Co2 depleted. Carbon dioxide levels are dangerously high. The oxygen level has fallen to 17 percent. I'm not feeling so well. You're maybe suffering the effects of oxygen deprivation. So this is how we die, hum? Pod 471. Do you read? Pod 471. This is the Orion escape pod. Do you read? I read. I read you, this is Isaac Havelock. Good to hear your voice, Isaac. We're on the final approach at a range of approximately 70 miles. We're covering for you, buddy. I love you guys! For now, we need help with the docking procedure ... so get ready to jump on your control system. OK, I've got you. No problem, just tell me what to do. Stand by, we are 40 miles and closing. 20 miles. I can see them. Yes, this is it. I can't believe this is actually happening. Performing a burn to slow our approach. Stand by. Okay, burn successful. Jump on your control system and hit the button. - Auto docking procedure engaged. - Great! We see your beacon. The ship is guiding us in. Ten seconds. nine, eight, seven, six, five, four ... three, two, one... Docking completed. Would you do the honors and unlock the door for us, Isaac? Okay, I've got it. Isaac, we need you to unlock the door. Eva, unlock the doors. Sorry, the door can not be opened when undocked... We are docked. No, Isaac. We are not. Shit! No no no... What's wrong, Isaac? Is everything alright? They left me here. Who have? Wasn't real. Warning, oxygen level at three percent. - Please ... - Isaac, should I call control? Clara ... - Isaac, should I call control? Clara ... I can't breathe. Warning, oxygen level at two percent. - Re-pressurize. - Warning! Automatic re-pressurization... has been prevented due to fire. Would you like to override it? Override! Okay, confirmed. Re-pressurising. Skill, can you hear us? Are you there, Havelock? What have you done to Alana? I think she's dead. I didn't destroy the ship. - We know. - What do you mean? We checked the camera in your capsule. It confirms was Alana that entered the ship. Docking completed. Eva, lights up. How long does it take for them to come around? About 30 seconds. - Our first customer. - Humm. - Hello, Miss Skill. - Making you awake, Skill. Up. Gets up. I thought this would be a second chance. Is that what they told you? No, you're here to work and do what we tell you so. And you're welcome to be our little bitch. Come on. Up guys, wake, wake! Wake, wake! Come on! Get up! Catch you. Fire detected. Emergency separation initiated. Good. You are awake. I can't believe she killed all those people. Listen, Havelock. Your oxygen level is running very low due to the re-pressurization that happened early. Most likely as a result of the fire. Unfortunately, it also looks like you got some damages to your ship's electrical systems. I already know all this, so what're you telling me? - I'm sincerely sorry. - Why? - We've looked at every option. - And? Every contingency plan, but there is no ship in the vicinity. NASA, military, or our own that can reach you ... Please ... And your oxygen is going to expire before we can mount a rescue. I'm really, really sorry, Isaac. What about re-entry? Is highly unlikely the capsule will make through the atmosphere. I'm sorry, Isaac. We've done everything we can down here. Sure you have. Let's stop pretending, shall we? You would never rescue us, because Alana blew the whole thing up. No. And there are lots of other people trapped as the capsules are floating around? Forty-nine. And no, they are not innocent. They are criminals. I'm not a murder. I'm here because you took people from a system under the pretend that... they did something wrong. If you filled the whole thing up with serial killers ... you had no one to lead the work. So my guess is you made a mistake with Alana. There must be hundreds of victims of this experiment of yours. Tell me. You're planning to save any of them? We're doing everything we can. So, that's a no, then. Goodbye, Isaac. Call terminated. Have a nice life. - Isaac? - What, Eva? You have used nine of your ten calls this month. Inbound and outbound calls count towards the allowance. Calls may be monitored by staff for violations. Eva? Do you think we'll make a re-entry? Odds of survival are 22 percent. - Would you risk it? - No. How long I got if I stay? Water supply will deplete in four days. Food will deplete in one day. Oxygen tanks will deplete in nine hours. Stabilization system fuel will deplete in 17 hours. Carbon dioxide levels will become toxic in 18 hours. - So, I have a day? - Yes. Eva, flip a coin. It's tails. I say I follow up the chance. I'm staying. - Eva, call Clara. - Sure, Isaac. Dialing. Isaac? You're okay? Better when I hear your voice. The human department was just on TV saying they'll pardon anyone who makes it back. Yes, because he does not think anyone will. Do not be so negative. Listen. There is no easy way to say this. I've some bad news. They... they're not coming to get me. And my oxygen runs out in a day. So... So I think... I think this is goodbye. Are you there? I'm here. I'm sorry for everything. I'm sorry for what I did. - That I'm here and I can't go back to you. - You don't need to apologize. It isn't your fault. Don't give up. Clara, they said ... Don't listen to them. Is there a chance? - A very slim one. - Then you take it. Are you hearing me, right? Please, Isaac. You know, people are paying bets on you ... Clara, listen. Whether you make it back or not. Listen to me, Clara. The odds are... hey, one-sided but that means that the return will be great. This is how we got into this mess in the first place, That's why I'm here. I wouldn't do that. Please tell me, you'll get better when we make it back. I'll tell you when you get back. Don't be mad at me. Just ... promise me. You're going to try. I'll try. I love you. I love you. Call terminated. Wish me luck. That woman is gonna be the death on me. Not that woman. - You're not dead, then? - Not yet. 22 percent ... I don't like these odds. I bet not. We have to try. Don't do this. Walk with me. I wanna take all the people who sent us here. I just want to see my family. Then, you must kill me. Don't be just a pariah as I am. They'll watch your back on the camera. They'll find any reason to not pardon you when you come back. I don't want to kill you. Don't struggle. So, this is it. Subtitles by Caradecuica
