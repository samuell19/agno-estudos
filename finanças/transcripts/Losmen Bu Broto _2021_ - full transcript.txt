That fish got so pale from fear because you're cutting it so fast. - Slow down. - Hey, you want to hear a rhyme? What is it? What do you call a delicious fish? That's a riddle, not a rhyme. First, you need to know what a rhyme is. - Alright. - But you haven't answered it. A you-cooked-it fish. The fish will be done cooking in a minute. Then make sure you spread the torch ginger sauce over the fish evenly, okay? Yes, Sire. Drive safely. Sri! Is it okay if we go now? Yeah. - Are you sure? - Yeah, if you dare. Of course we do! Bye! - Bye! - Take care! - I'm going. - Drive safely. Where is the dish? - Still in progress. - Oh, man. Be patient. - Have you unclogged the toilet? - I have, Ma'am. - The lights in the hallway? Good. - All done. - Tarjo, call Sri. - Yes, Mother? - She said a couple of songs, but so late? - Right. - Hello, Sis? - Hello. - I'm already here. - You're here. Come on in. - I'm home, Mother, Father. - Sri, I don't like what you're wearing. We've been waiting for you. Waiting for me or Pur's fish dish? It is still "in progress." - It's on the way! - Hear that? - I'm hungry. - Really? - Yes. - Let's eat. Yes? Who is this? Surely we belong to God, and to God, we shall return. Anton had an accident. It was fatal. Surely we belong to God, and to God, we shall return. Here comes the fish with torch ginger sauce! I prefer this sign made by Jarot. It is a lot more artistic, you know? - Of course, he's a millennial. - No. I think this one is better. Put it up. I'm putting it up! Chill out. Look, the vegetables are coming. ADAPTED FROM THE TV SERIES LOSMEN BY TATIEK MALIYATI AND WAHYU SIHOMBING Miss Siska! Atmo! I missed you! I missed you too! Mr. Bayu... Hello. Your beard has become thicker. Hello, Kinara. Listen, Kirana. Don't come and check in at this inn again. People would start to think that we are a place for wives to flee their husbands. Isn't it good? It's like a therapy inn. A solo healing. Your father can be the therapist. He knows so well about Javanese men, like my husband. You made up with Ian after just one piece of advice from my father, while you've been ignoring all my advice! - You're unbelievable! - Oh, come on. - Have a seat. - Thanks. - Lastri. - Yes, Miss? - Help her check out. - Of course. - Sri! Hey! - Siska! - Welcome. - Thank you. Welcome back. Sis, Bayu and Siska booked the same room they stayed at for their honeymoon. Why did you move them without consulting me? What do you mean? I got the order from Mother. She wants that room exclusively for Auntie Willem. Are you done? Sri, did you know that Tarjo had gone with Raffell since this morning? Could you please tell Tarjo that my son is here to focus on his study? He will not get into UGM if he keeps playing around. - Let me help you. - I'm good. I want to talk about the Srikandi room. We must give our best for Auntie Willem. You know, after living in the Netherlands for so long, she would nag when little things are out of place. You can give her the Arimbi room. - Raffell! Your mother is looking for you. - Yes? She must want me to study. I don't feel like it. Meet her, or I will bear the consequences. - Just go. - Come on! - Tarjo. You're skipping class again? - Yes? I don't have time for that. You see I'm preparing for the honorary guest. I hope you're always in good health. - Thank you. - Thanks. Let's go. If anything happens in Arimbi room, it's on you, Sri. Okay. Looks like everyone is super busy. What's the special occasion? - It's Auntie Willem. - Pardon? Isabel. That distant cousin of Mrs. Broto who once lived here. She's coming here. She was the person who didn't approve of our marriage. - But why? - You know why. Social status. But we were already in love anyway. So, every time we had a date, we'd meet in this very place. - Under this jackfruit tree, you know? - I see. I even carved this. Broto Loves Deborah. Come on, hurry up. Dimas, let's get ready. - Hurry up! - Dimas. Mr. Broto caught this. Miss Pur. Mr. Broto asked you to cook this fish. Hendro, you do it. I have a headache. Come, Father. They're here? - I don't know, but Mother is at the door. - Alright, then. Look. If it's not your mother... - Honey, stand here. - What is it? - Look at this. - Yes? I'm wearing the same outfit as Tarjo. Twinning with Father? - It looks good, honey. - It's the procedure. Sir, Ma'am. Miss Pur said she is having a headache. That's fine. She looked fine. Get her here. Honey, she's having a headache. Let her rest. It's just a quick greeting. You know Isabel cares a lot about Pur. - Get her here. - As you wish. The guest is here! - Be ready. Everyone, smile. - Yes, Ma'am. Why are you here? Sri, stand here. Tarjo, get ready. Keep straight. Come in! - Park there. - Okay. - Atmo! Ask him to move his car! - Yes, Ma'am? - Are you welcoming an honorary guest? - Go! Sir, Ma'am. Tarjo. Sri. If I'm not mistaken, you just checked out last week. I've been asked to set up an exhibition. We are fully booked. - She's right. - Actually, we have one. Kirana has checked out, so the room is available. Oh, my God. Please go ahead, then. - We're having an important guest. - Yes, Ma'am. Tarjo. Now here comes the right guest! - Are you sure? - Get ready. Come on, pull it in and park there. Good afternoon, Mr. and Mrs. Broto. - Good afternoon. - I'm Yudhis. Yudhistira! - Oh. - It's you! You've grown a lot. My mother said sorry that she is unable to come. Last night we had to stop at a hospital in Semarang because she had a fever. How is she now? She's fine. Nothing serious. - Thank God. - I see. I hope she gets better soon. Yudhis, meet Sri. My second child. And that is Tarjo. My youngest. Finally, I can see you in person. I saw your performance on Instagram. She looks different. You can see her live at Kedai Kebun every... Singing is just her hobby. Her main duty is running this inn. Please, come in. I'm sorry, but I must go back to Semarang. And when my mother's feeling better, we'll leave for Jakarta. Well, if you say so... Have a safe trip, then. - Send my regards to your mother. - I'll excuse myself, then. Oh, well. We can't do anything about it. - Hey. - Sri. - I want to have a word with you. - Yes, Mother. Wake up! What is it? Why did you argue with me in front of a guest? A guest? You mean with Jarot. Because there is a room available. We must be more careful in selecting our guests in this place. So that the other guests won't be disturbed. Not to mention he made Tarjo skip school more often. Him skipping school has nothing to do with Jarot. Don't talk back at me. - Honey! - Yes, honey? What about the food? We've prepared a lot. Who will eat them? Give them to Gito or whoever you'd like. - I'm having a word with Sri. - Okay. Dear Lord. Do you have a crush on him? Jarot? - No, I don't. - Pur said otherwise. You two are already dating. No, Mother, we're not. A guy like him has no future. Come on, eat. Right. Who else wants this? Bayu? Here, have some mangut lele. Actually, I feel sorry for my mother. She was so disappointed. I guess she can only be at peace when Auntie Willem comes here and acknowledges this inn. She was so against my mother building this inn. She thought it's as if my mother degrades herself by being a servant for her guests. Hey, use the spoon! - I brought it for you. - No need. I'm using my hand. And the fact that Auntie Willem lives so far away. Between Jakarta and the Netherlands. Yet she's still worry about bad judgment from her. - That's not a good way to live. - Of course it's not. You know what's good? This food. Look... Do you have any idea - for the exhibition? - I haven't thought about it. I'm still worried about Mother. Why is she holding on to her past with Auntie Willem? Don't we all need to live life one day at a time and move forward? - You're right. - It's always Auntie Willem... Hold on. What is it? I think I just got an idea for a song. Wow, would you look at this? Mangut lele. It still smells so good. Eat it, okay? Your headache comes from your feelings. It will keep coming back if you don't fight it. What should I fight? Your doubt. Life is like a globe. It rotates endlessly. Sometimes it's bright. Other times, it's dark. Now, look at you. You're stuck in the dark side. You're staying there. Why? I really miss your cooking. When will you cook for me like you used to? Come on, honey. Isabel couldn't make it here because of an illness, - not because she... - I'm not talking about that. Yudhistira is an established young entrepreneur. I think he is suitable for Sri. Don't you think Pur knows something about us? Of course she does. This is where she and Anton would spend their time alone. - Really? - Yeah. You mean Pur and Anton - used to do this? - What are you doing? A lady from Klaten wants to sing for us. Please. Let's give her a big round of applause. Raffell, finish your food. Your dad will make a video call to see how prepared you are for tomorrow's test. Yes, Mom. How do you like our soto ayam? - Good? - It isn't. - It isn't? - It isn't enough. Oh, we have more. Let me get you some more. Thank you. - Sri. - Yeah? Hello, all. Good evening. - Why don't you sing? - But I don't know how to sing keroncong. Why don't you go to Kedai Kebun? I perform there every Sunday. - Sounds good. Let me know the time. - Of course. Excuse me. Sri. What were you doing with Jarot in the storage room? About that... I offered him to work on his piece there so he wouldn't disturb other guests. I also asked him to pay the rent. - And then? - He agreed. Show some smile, Sis. You might drive the guests away. What do you mean? Auntie is not coming again, Uncle? Well... She always answered... "I will come." I'll stay here with you. Thank you. Please. But... when will... the gourami with torch ginger sauce be served? I don't know yet. You'd better get some rest now. In a minute. There is a negative comment about our inn on this travel website. What does it say? "The place is clean, the service was good, but one of the staff was unpleasant and snappy." Well, you can't say they're talking about Pur. - Then who? - I don't know. I understand her feelings, honey. Who wouldn't be sad? But it's been more than a year. When will she stop? Hey, you're still here? What is it? You'd better think again about the offer of Java tour for Matahati. I don't think it's possible. I have responsibilities at the inn. Are you okay? I'm fine. But the offer will be beneficial for Matahati, - especially when you... - Excuse me. - I will prescribe you some vitamins. - Okay, Doc. Take it once a day for a month. Sri! What if Jarot doesn't want to take responsibility? Let him be. I might be more confused if he does. What do you mean? I don't want to force him to do something he doesn't want. To get married... and have a child. If that's not in his mind, I'm okay with it. I believe I can... raise this child myself. Are you sure? Don't you want to abort it? Look, having a child will change your life. Do you have any objections... to do a duet with a mother? Of course I don't! It's not about us. It's about the inn. - What should I do? - I'm here for you. And Ian too. Relax. Checkmate! - Just wait and see, Broto. - There's no way out. - Hold on. - This is tough for you. Sri. - Sri. - Uncle. - Your mother was looking for you. - Yes, Father. Is it a sin that I praise you? What is it, Herman? Sri looks exhausted, her face looks pale. I've told you all. Never take anything out of this box! I don't care whether it's blunt, broken, or rusty. Don't ever use it! Understood? - Understood, Miss. - Yes, Miss. Put everything back into the box! Now! Pur. Who does this belong to? May I borrow it? Pur... Let me help you. This is a gift from Auntie Willem for my 17th birthday. Too bad it's cracked. Where is the doll in it? Someone broke it. It was Sri. I didn't break it. It fell from above the cupboard. It was already like this when I found it. But Pur still believes that you broke it. That's how she is. - Jarot, I... - Wait. This is interesting. I can use it for my exhibition. Memories seen from a different perspective. Something that people can relate to. Good morning! MRS. BROTO'S INN WELCOME Hi, Jarot. - Hi, Mbok. - Yeah. Can you believe how expensive everything is right now? - Tell me about it. - Everything at the market is expensive. Unbelievable. Lastri, get up! - The guests are here. - Sorry. - Could you pass me the guest list? - Right away. - This isn't all? - Yeah, there is one more back there. - Bring here now. - Sure. - Here, you can check it. - Okay. - There are ten guests, Lastri? - Correct. They should be able to speak Indonesian since they've been here for long. - All good. Thank you. - Thank you. SORRY IF I'M BOTHERING YOU MY MOM IS FEELING BETTER I'M GOING TO YOGYA. HOPE TO SEE YOU SOON OKAY Sri, is this true? You have your future here, Sri. What you're good at is running this inn. Mrs. Broto, Miss Sri. How do we greet the Japanese guests? With a garland or a bouquet? - A garland! - A garland! Thank you. Aren't you tired of living this double life? What do you mean? Look at this. I don't see you here. - Your image is different from... - Your image? From this inn. Don't you ever see that now even ministers act in TV dramas? Many officials use TikTok. People do live double lives. They are different. They don't run this inn. So, this is about Auntie Willem? This has nothing to do with her! How did Yudhis get my number? He sends me texts all the time. What are you planning with her? We don't have any plans. Isabel has nothing to do with this. I've made my choice. You don't have to answer now. - I'm just giving you advice here. - I can answer it now. I want to sing, Mother. I don't want to run this inn. - Urip! - Yes, Miss? Never mind. You're hanging the wrong lanterns. Those are Chinese, not Japanese. - Oh, shoot. - Go and replace them. - The guests are arriving. - Yes, Miss. Who will greet them? Me and Lastri. Lastri! - Coming. - Have you practiced? - We have. - Show me. So, there will be ten servings for the afternoon snack. - Yes. - Make it for 15 people, Pur. No one told me about the extra five portions. I'm telling you now. Do you think serving meals is that easy? It takes careful planning, you know. You can't just ask me to add an extra five portions like this. I understand, Sis. The platform hasn't been set? Go ask Tarjo, not me. Pur. Tarjo said he had a schedule at his campus, so I will help you tonight. No, you're a guest. - Don't worry. - Can you? Yeah. I have organized many events for my school. Don't worry. - Okay, go take care of it. - Yes, Ma'am. You'll be responsible if anything happens, Sri. Of course I will, as I always do. What did you mean by that? Sri, what's wrong? Are you okay? Mbok Tun! - Mbok! - I'm okay. Sri? Hello? Thank you. You went that far? Amazing. - Go ahead. - Hold on. - Fell. - Sri, the band is coming late. Where are they? They're on their way from Solo. What should we do? Come on, Fell! Could you go ask Atmo if there is another performer? It's good, right? Atmo. Atmo. How about we perform a dance? Ladies and gentlemen. May I have your attention? Well, the exclusive entertainment in this inn will begin shortly. But in the meantime, please enjoy our delicious meals made by my Pur. It's delicious, isn't it? I have a daughter. Her name is Sri. She's good at singing. Do you want to hear her singing? Atmo, call her here. Sri, come here. Give her applause! Come! - I can't do it. - Yes, you can. It's okay. Isn't she pretty? - Good evening. - Good evening. My name is Sri. I will sing a song tonight. Please, enjoy. She's doing great, don't you think? Why did you ask her to sing? She has a sweet voice. Let us hear her sweet voice. The guests look happy. Can you believe that they asked me to sing? Mother looked very unhappy. What do you think? It's very personal. Every object at this inn has its own stories. Memories. And each person has their stories. That's how a family is. People often... let themselves trapped in a package... that they made. A package of prejudice... and others' expectations. This is beautiful. Any idea for the title? Box of Memories... Box of Memories. I never cared about others' side of a story. I only know one side. My mom's. About the cowardly man who abandoned my mother and me. Look, Sri. Do you think... I will end up acting like my father? Why did you say that? It is all clear now. Pur is the witness. What do you mean? - Sri. - Sri? I think you should talk to her. It is two months along. Say something. - What do you want me to say? - Really? Anything! But what should I say? You should tell her to rethink about dating someone like... That guy, Jarot. What do you want me to tell her? Break them off? Yes. Why did you even ask? Listen, honey. How can you break off people who are in love? Even if I break them off here, they will still meet outside. I mean, that's what we did. - Honey! - You know it! The jackfruit tree that you cut down is the witness. That's different, don't try to compare it. You are not Jarot. I know it's different. You and Sri are the foolish ones. You're both so similar. - What do you mean? - You're both stubborn! Never mind! I'm going to tell my parents. I don't care if you come with me. Sri, wait. You don't want to find another way? Are you suggesting an abortion? - You're crazy. - That's not what I mean. Forget it, honey. It may be a temporary relationship. - Let them be for now. - I won't have it! Sri needs to be reminded! Can I ask for more time? For how long? Until I get bigger? The sooner, the better. Before it's too late. I will take responsibility. Just give me more time to figure this out. - Hi, Mr. Broto. Have a good run. - Thank you. Take a look at this. You can take your group to Prambanan Temple, and then you can have lunch at Ratu Boko Palace. And finally, watch the sunset at Plaosan Temple. What a good travel plan. - I should go now. - Please. - Good morning, Sri. - Good morning, Uncle. Sri, please take this herbal medicine. For you. I need to take a walk. I got bored here. Please, go ahead. FOR PREGNANT WOMEN Miss Sri? - Ma'am asked for you. - Okay. - Tarjo. - Yes, Mother? Don't you have to take the guests to the Plaosan Temple? But aren't we holding a family meeting? It's not a family meeting. We just want to talk to Sri. This feels important. Everybody looks tense. - I'll let Atmo take them instead. - Tarjo. - Okay, Father. - Don't worry, I'll tell you later. - Really? - Yeah. I'm leaving. - Do you want more drink? - I'm good. Sri. Do you really want to be with him? Why did you ask, Mother? One at a time. One at a time. Yes, I do. Are you planning to marry Jarot? - Yes, Mother. - Dear Lord. Sri. Are you sure that this guy will be with you until you both grow old? We love each other. That was not the question! I cannot predict my future. Sri... Marriage... is a serious choice in life. The person you marry will determine your future until you get old. So I'm asking you, are you sure, at this very moment, he is the guy that will be with you until you get old? - I'm sure, Father. - Dear Lord. - How can you be sure? - Why do you doubt it? Don't you see what kind of guy Jarot is? What? He has no purpose, a pig-headed, and never thinks about his future. He lives recklessly. Can't you see it? I don't see him that way. He is smart and talented. He's chasing his dream. He's not perfect, but he's not ashamed of his flaws. You've been fooled. How? You're blinded by love, so you can't see the real Jarot. - It's useless, then. - What's useless? Whatever my answer about him will not satisfy you all. Perhaps you should understand it now. You must know who Jarot is. Don't be stubborn. So, the only ideal man was Anton? - Sri... - Only Anton, who had been blessed by our parents, could be accepted into our family? Don't you dare say his name. He has nothing to do with this. I don't even need to. He's always in your head. - He's gone. - He lives in your mind! - Enough! - No! Mother and Father must know why you suddenly care about me and Jarot. - Why me? - You're jealous. - Jealous? - That's true. So, you have forgotten that if you didn't cry that night, and you didn't ask to be picked up at the place you performed, Anton wouldn't get into the accident! - He'd live and still be by my side! - Enough! Enough... Enough, both of you. Calm down. Excuse me. - Sri... - Mrs. Broto? Hi, Mrs. Angga. Excuse me, but have you seen Raffell? I couldn't find him anywhere. Let's go and ask Atmo about this. Shall we? I did ask him, and he has no idea where he is. - I see. - Your son went out with Tarjo. Tarjo texted me that Raffell insisted on tagging along as the tour leader. Why did you allow him? Mrs. Broto, I brought my son here so he could be more focused on his study, but he kept getting involved in such useless activities. He wanted it, Mrs. Angga. You're supposed to refuse him or at least ask for my permission first. This could ruin his study, you know? - Ma'am. - Don't. - Aren't you tired of dictating your son? - Sri. Please understand him for once. - He is not a robot. - Sri! - Why you... - Sri... - Why did she talk to me like that? - Please forgive her. Please calm down. I'm so sorry. Let me call Tarjo to bring your son back. Or I can ask Atmo to pick him up. - Don't worry. - Okay. - Just keep me informed. - I will. I am so sorry about this. Sri. I never hesitated to take responsibility by marrying you. I just don't feel capable of being a good father for our child. And I need to figure it out, Sri. I don't want to be trapped in the box of memories made of prejudices. Believe me. I will be back soon. Pur, come here. Can you stay and eat this soto with me again? Here at the inn... I'm waiting for two things... that haven't arrived yet. First, my wife. Second... is your cooking. It is indeed... not easy... to forget and to let go of someone who has left. Indeed. Are you talking about me, Uncle? Both of us. I also lost my child in a car accident. In fact, at that time, my wife didn't allow me to take our child, Cempaka, to his lesson. Because she knew... I was sleepy and very tired. But I didn't listen to her. It is not easy... to forgive a person... who made you suffer. Even when that person is suffering just as much. Perhaps... this isn't about us... with the other person. This is about us with ourselves. Perhaps what we need... is to forgive ourselves. Please! - How was it? - It was fun! Here. - Take this. - What is this? Your commission. - Are you sure? - I am. - This is too much. - Tarjo. Don't ever ask my son to do useless things like this again. - Give it to me! - But, Mom... He's not here for some cash. - Come! - Mom... I'm disappointed staying here. We offer our apology if something upsets you... You should just stick to running the inn and don't intervene in other family's affairs. I'm sorry if you feel that way, Mrs. Angga. But if you feel disappointed and dissatisfied, you have the right as a guest. However, allow me to explain this. We, the Brotos, had never intervened in our guests' private matters. In fact, our guests come here with their own problems. But my son was dutiful before coming here. Look, Mrs. Angga. It's not wrong if we feel concerned and try to give attention. That's part of our spirit in developing the inn. We don't need your concern. It is me that have concern over your family. You're too nosy about our family when your own family have problems. None of your children even graduated college. Mom! I don't want to go to college. I want to be like Tarjo. Raffell, I'm nobody right now. I have yet to prove that I can live by my choice. If you want to be understood by others, you should understand them first. You should understand your mother. Come on, son. Mother. You're right, Tarjo. You must understand people first before expecting them to understand you. Now, you must understand me. Atmo! - Yes, Ma'am. - Get Sri and Pur to come here. Yes, Ma'am. Look, Pur. How did it end up being so expensive? I've already set the operational budget. I already followed your budget, Mother. So how did it come to a deficit? Because your budget was actually too low. The price of groceries has increased. Some have even doubled. You didn't inform me. What do you mean? I do inform you every time, but you never listened. You just told me to manage somehow. So, this is the result of your management? Yes, Mother. If I didn't manage it, the deficit would've been more. Why don't you go ask Sri? Maybe she can help you with this. Sri? It's always Sri. She's smarter, braver. - She understands things better. - Pur! Don't be too sensitive. It's about the inn. I'm not, Mother. She's the reason my report has a deficit. - What? - I've suggested to you, to Father, and Sri too, to give a limited options of menu for the guests. Two or three options every day. But what did Sri say? "It's okay to let them choose anything. That's what makes us different from other inns and raises our service to the top." She's right, though. She has a point. You're right, Mother. Fix this, I don't accept it. Yes, Mother. Excuse me. I'm sorry, Sis. Frankly, I was jealous of you. You had Anton, he was such a good person. He loved you so much. - That's why... - Enough. That's why I insisted he picked me up that night. I got so annoyed when he didn't show up. - I thought you didn't allow him... - He died because of me! He got into that accident because of me! It's okay, I got this. - You don't have to. - Just go and pick up Sri. What about Tarjo? He is too tired after taking the guests to Parangtritis. I see. Alright, then. The fish will be done cooking in a minute. Yes, Sire. Drive safely. - Pur... - What is it? Why don't we get married? Stop it! - You're already late. - What do you say? Let's talk about it later. Go! The fish will get burnt! I'm sure it will wait for you. Just go already! - Drive safely. - Yeah. - Come on. - Let's go. I'm home, Mother, Father. Sri, I don't like what you're wearing. I was waiting for Anton, but he never showed up. We've been waiting for you. Waiting for me or Pur's fish dish? ANTON Now Anton is calling. Yes? I thought... I could have peace if I made you the cause of his death. That I could let him go. But it doesn't turn out that way. I haven't even answered his last question. Yes, Anton. I want to marry you. Actually, I'm jealous of you too. He really loved you. Sis... He always reminded me to be a good sister for you... to always support you. Even though I know you don't need support from anybody. You're great. You have a gift. You can win anything. You can be number one in school. And win singing contests. I'm pregnant. It's two months along. Did Jarot know about it? He left after I told him. I've been abandoned. He abandoned me. So how long are you keeping it a secret? This is delicious. Mother, Father. Sri has something to say. What do you want to say? About Jarot? He's already gone. Let's eat first before we talk about some serious matters. Atmo! Get Tarjo to join us for dinner. - Honey. - He's at the campus, Sir. - He's right. - At this hour? Come on, honey. Leave some for Tarjo. - Yes, Ma'am. - You can join us, Atmo. This is a delicious duck dish Yudhistira gave us. - I think he has a thing for you, Sri. - Honey. Listen, honey. She deserves to get a better one, don't you think? Knock it off. Dig in, Pur. Sri. Come on, eat. I'm pregnant. Good evening. Looks like the duck party has begun. How do you like it, Sir? My mother said it's your favorite. Oh, right! Bebek bacem, yeah. This is indeed my favorite. Send my gratitude to your mother for this dish. Anyway, Atmo... Take Yudhis to have some coffee in the front yard. Yes, Sir. Shall we, Mr. Yudhis? Excuse me. I am sorry. Father. Mother. I was careless. But I swear to God, this is not a plan for him to be accepted in our family. So... where is he now? - He's... - She doesn't know. He sent her a text. He said he will take responsibility. I see. He just needs more time. So, what now? What is your plan now? I'm keeping the baby. With or without Jarot. You... must leave this place. You don't belong here. Mother... This is her choice. She must bear the consequences. Leave this place. Now! Father. She is right. She must stay out of this place during her pregnancy. No. Forever. Sri... will not come back to this place, ever. I think we're done talking here. Your father and I will see Yudhistira. Let's go, honey. Father. Sri... Everything will be alright. Overthinking is not good, you know? How is her condition now? Is she getting better? Well, she's much better now. Thank God. I'm glad to hear it. I hope she gets better. - Amen. - I hope so too. Anyway, Yudhis. I have to excuse myself. - Okay, Sir. - Excuse me. So, how is she now? She's continuing her chemotherapy. Chemotherapy? Take this. Don't forget this. You knew. Yeah. I was just waiting... for you to come forward and tell us. Aren't you mad? I'm mad. I'm furious with you. But your mother is more furious and disappointed. So, I don't think I need to be madder. There is no need to cry over spilled milk. Please forgive me. Please forgive me, Father. Sri. This is not a mistake. Think about your child. This is fate. This is the path you have chosen. This is your path. It's alright. I really don't know what's the matter with you and my mom. And frankly, - she's here in Yogya. - Really? She just can't come here yet. She said she hasn't found the right wig. She wears wigs? Yes, she has gotten bald. She's been missing you a lot since she got sick. But she is worried that you know about her illness. Mother. I'm leaving. Father. Do you even agree with Mother's decision? This isn't about agreeing. It's about principle. Your mother chose it over her. And I respect your mother's choice. But, Father... Sri needs our support more than ever. When she was doing it with Jarot, did she need our support? Well? Paimin! - Urip! - Hey! There he is. - Do you have it? - It's inside. - It's there. - Good. Mother. - You're going already? - Yes. - Keep up your good work. - Sure. - Don't hang out after school. - I won't. - That's good. - I'm going. - Take care. - I will. Hey, you rascal! Is this all? Ningsih has the rest. I see, then you can sit down. The guests haven't arrived. - It's done? - All good. - Lastri, get up. - Yes, Ma'am. - Is this the last one? - Yes. Good job. - Hello. - Hello. Welcome, Mr. Ketut, to our inn. - Welcome, Mr. Ketut. - Please. Please come in. Thank you for coming back here. Give it to me. Pur. Look. SPECIAL REQUEST VEGETARIAN FOOD Make sure that you serve us delicious meals tonight. - Don't worry, Sir. - Remember, all vegetarian. I'll make sure of it. - The competition is getting fierce. - Sure it is. Excuse me. - Hello. - Hi, Yudhis. - What a beautiful house. - How are you? Haven't you come here? I have, but only at the gate. Really? - Then I'll give you a tour. - You know what? He is like a knight on a white horse. Almost like he showed up to save you. I don't need to be saved. My life isn't that bad. But he really is a gentleman. He has a big heart. And he accepts an economy package. I mean, a plus package. You know, with the baby. Do I really have to date? Why don't you get married right away? You're so fickle. Right now, I'm free and can sing anytime I want. And you suggest that I get married? Well, just look at him. I think you will have a secure life with him. The inn will be secured. So will your career. Am I right? Is it that perfect? Yeah! You see, "S-Y." Sri-Yudhistira. On the wedding invitation. Please enjoy. How do you like the food? Please enjoy. - Good evening. - Here they come. This is Pur, she cooked these meals. - I'll let you enjoy the food. - Enjoy the meals. The acoustic band is not coming. Yeah... Mr. Ketut, gentlemen, I'll be right back. The band said they can play here tomorrow. They have another gig tonight, so they can't be here. May I have your attention, please? We want to offer our apology. Actually, we were going to entertain all of you with a performance. But something came up, so... I'm not the one who contacts them, Miss Pur. It was Mrs. Broto. Tarjo didn't help? - But we have the replacement ready. - He's busy with college. Our wonderful staff. Let me present you... Atmo, come here! Looks like I am about to perform. Please give it up for Atmo! Can I have another round of applause? You're not synchronized enough. Let's try one more time. Now you're too synchronized. Thank you, Mr. Broto. It made me so embarrassed. You should've been more meticulous. But that is not my job. I'm just helping as I can while Sri is away. She will not return to this place. So everything will become your duty. Our duty. I know I'm not as smart as she is. I'm not as meticulous. I'm not as reliable as she is for you. I accept that I'll always be your second best. But you must know, I have given my all. Now you only have me here. Please give me some time. Please give me some space. I know I can do it. Excuse me. Pur... I know Pur made a mistake. But you know... she was helping you... wholeheartedly. We already lost Sri. Let's not lose Pur too. Pur... You did great. Thank you. My mother liked it. - She saw it? - Yes, I sent her the video. She and your mother started talking on the phone more often. She said Mrs. Broto is so backward for not letting you sing. Then your mother got sulky and didn't call her for two days. But then they made it up. - Honey. - Let go of me! I told Jarot to come here. Sri... Thank you. Why is he here? Don't pull over! Oh, my God! Wait here. How's Sri doing? Can you give this to her for me? He's out of his mind, waiting by our house. - I didn't even greet him. - It's okay, honey. It's not okay. He looks like a thief or a beggar. That's how artists look. I looked like that when we were dating. But you're cuter. Don't be too hard on him. He even gave her a letter, so cheesy. It's not a letter. It's an album cover. This is good. Let me see it. This is great! Nice one. We're not using it. Right, Sri? Why? You said it's good. Let me have another look. No. This is not good. - Just use it. - No way! Jarot made it. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - We just arrived from Surabaya. - I see. - Is there any room available? - Yes. Please, come in. Lastri, help them. - Please, come in. - Please, Ma'am, this way. This way. Have a good rest. Let me help you to check in. You can see here. There are several types of rooms in our inn. DIMENSION FEATURING JAROT PAMBUDI & ALLAN RUSLAN S. WHAT TIME DO YOU WANT ME TO PICK YOU UP? AT 4:00 P.M. FROM KIRANA'S HOUSE I'LL BE THERE BY 4:00 P.M. SRI, I THINK YOU SHOULD SEE HIM Jarot, Sri is here. Sri! I met my father. I needed to find out... what was his reason... for abandoning me and my mother. I also needed to know... whether I will be like him... to our child. I was ready to confront him about all his mistakes... towards me and my mother. But I found out... that my late mother... was his second wife. I was late. Because just a few days before I arrived in Surabaya, my father... had been buried. But they welcomed me well. My step-mother... and my step-siblings. Apparently, he... He bought all my works. Perhaps it was his way... to keep in touch with me... and support me financially. Because... my mother... didn't want him in our lives. You know, I... really want to... hear his side of the story. And I learned that he was also into photography. I was holding on to a wrong prejudice about him. Sri... I am sorry. I made a mistake. Sweet potatoes, Miss Pur? Some fresh vegetables? Please have a look. What fresh veggies. That'll be 10,000. Pur. Ma'am, Miss. Miss Sri and Jarot are here. Tarjo. I am sorry. Sri! - How is your baby? - It's good. Mother. Have a seat. Just say it. - What's your intention? - Honey. I will take responsibility. I will marry Sri, and... I'm here to ask for your blessing. - Is that it? - Yes, Ma'am. - Alright, then. - Wait, honey. Stay a bit longer. I think it's obvious. Sri will not return to this inn. Honey, wait. I understand. Sri told me everything. I only come here to ask for your blessing. And I have given it to you. That's all, right? What else? Honey, a marriage proposal is a meeting between two families. Let's hear from his family first. What family? Excuse me, Mr. and Mrs. Broto. Looks like I'm late. I'm Restu, Jarot's step-mother. This is Indah, his step-sister. On behalf of Jarot's family, I'm offering a sincere apology to your family for making this seem so rushed. I wonder if you have any requirements that we have to meet. There is no requirement, Mrs. Restu. The sooner, the better. So everything will be done in no time. Skip the party. We're doing it at the Religious Affairs Office. I'm very grateful to you for coming today to propose to my daughter. I appreciate it. Please excuse me. How long will you stay mad? I feel hurt, honey. Sri, our daughter... - I know. - Sri... How could she do that? I know she made a mistake. She destroyed your hope. But if I think about it, we as parents are in the wrong too. How so? It's true. We have too many expectations for our children to be perfect. We didn't realize that they are like us. They have their fears. They have their weaknesses. They have different desires, and we cannot force them to be like us. - I never forced them. - Come on! Sometimes we didn't realize that we often pushed them too far. Honey. Now is the time... to embrace them. So they feel that we're here for them. As parents... and a place that their hearts to reside in forever. Easier said than done. No. I was thinking like you before. I didn't believe it. - What? - Do you remember? It was you who convinced your father. - Remember? - What? That's the witness. The jackfruit tree. Have a look. Broto loves Deborah. We made a promise under that jackfruit tree. Even though we... came from two different worlds, but we will keep this home together so that our children... feel comfortable, safe... and also happy here. Do you remember? - Did I say that? - Yes, you did! Have you forgotten? Look at you, Deborah. - Sri... - Forgive me, Mother. Stand up. Please forgive me. - Stand up. - I was wrong. I forgive you. - Stand up. - No. You haven't forgiven me. You haven't given your blessing for our marriage. I have given it to you. Stand up. I don't want that kind of blessing. Then what do you want? I want you to pray for me and guide me. So I will be able... to live... my married life because I know it won't be easy. I need you, Mother. And Father. I need Tarjo and Pur. - I need this family. - I know. Yes, Sri. I'm sorry too. I will give my blessing the way you want it. I will be there for you. Anytime you need me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. I'm sorry too... Pur... Mother. - I'm sorry, my daughter. - Yes, Mother. I will be there for you too. Yes, Mother. Anytime you need me. Yes, Mother. MRS. BROTO'S INN - Don't exhaust yourself, okay? - Don't worry. Let me carry this. Make sure you eat well. And let me know if you need anything. - Good thing I don't get nauseous anymore. - Glad to hear that. Take good care of your baby, okay? - Yes, Father. - Hold on. Alright. Take care of your wife, okay? - Treat her well. - Let's keep in touch. - Alright, drive safely. - Bye. I'm actually worried about them. You should trust them. They are adults. Should I send Mbok Tun to help them around their house? Help with what? To prepare meals and everything for them. Pur needs her more here. Let's just hope for the best for them. Alright, then. I missed you so much, Deborah! You didn't greet him! - Hello. - Hi, Broto. Please have a seat. Give them some applause! Here comes the fish with torch ginger sauce! Now, this is what we've been waiting for. - A very special dish. - Here is the special dish. Sour fish with torch ginger sauce. How is it? Finally, I can enjoy this super delicious dish. I'm glad to hear that. Look at Father. MRS. BROTO'S INN
