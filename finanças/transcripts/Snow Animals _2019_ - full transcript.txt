Every year, winter transforms our world, creating dazzling displays of frost, snow and ice. For us, it's a magical season, but for other animals, it's the toughest time of the year. I've been lucky enough to spend time in the company of some of the extraordinary animals that live through the wildest winters on Earth. I'm fascinated by the strategies they've developed to get them through those challenging months. SQUAWKING So now I'm finding out more about how animals prepare for winter... ..how they stay warm in some of the coldest temperatures on the planet... ..and manage to find food even in the deepest snow. I want to discover how their priorities and survival tactics change as winter comes to an end. SQUEALING I'm uncovering the fascinating stories behind how animals living in some of the most demanding places on Earth have evolved ingenious ways to survive, no matter what winter may bring. Winter, the season of sparkling, icy beauty. But this time of year poses a real challenge for the animals living through it. As winter arrives, temperatures start to drop. Here in the Alps they can plummet to a bone-chilling minus 33 degrees C. All around the world animals have to face these conditions day in, day out. BIRD CHIRPS And it's harder to find food. The vegetation has, for the most part, died out, and underneath all this ice and snow, it makes it so much harder to hunt. The days are also shorter. Here in the Alps, we're getting about eight hours of sun, But as you move closer to the North Pole, there's virtually no daylight, which ultimately means there's even less time to feed. Whether it's taking to the ice in the far north... ..or huddling up at the bottom of the world... ..every animal must find a way to get through the toughest season of all. The key to surviving winter for many animals is preparation, and the work must begin months in advance. On the island of Hokkaido in Japan, forests are alight with the blazing colours of autumn. This change is a sign that winter is fast approaching. And for the Siberian chipmunk, it's a critical moment. This male must gather as much food as possible to see him through what lies ahead. And it's a race against time. Chipmunks are one of the smallest members of the squirrel family. But to survive the winter, they need to find and safeguard up to four kilos of food in their underground burrows. And they have an ingenious technique for gathering supplies, using their very own built-in storage. These expandable cheek pouches can stretch to three times the size of the chipmunk's head... ..allowing them to gather up to 165 acorns every day. He needs as many as he can get his paws on before he goes into hibernation. He's been working hard for weeks to build up his winter larder. But it can be a struggle to get the goods before others do. SQUEAKING SQUEAKING The competition is fierce... ..especially when an animal three times your size appears in your territory. But this chipmunk won't let the red squirrel get the better of him, defending his patch ferociously. After all, his life depends upon it. SQUEAKING When the food gathering is complete, he collects leaves and grasses to create a cosy den to sleep in. Once settled in, he'll be waking up every few days, feeding on his stockpile to keep him going. Chipmunks are not the only species hard at work storing food. As winter approaches, animals all around the world are frantically gathering nuts and for very good reason. Nuts are the perfect packaged foods to see animals through winter. Their hard shells preserve all the goodness inside. Acorns, for example, are packed full of vitamins and calcium and fats. They're a high-energy food. In fact, this many acorns, about 100g, is equivalent to 400 calories. Now, that's the same as about ten chocolate biscuits, or... ..this many raspberries. Now, the fact that nuts are so highly nutritious and key to the survival of so many animals during winter has led to some pretty remarkable adaptations. The fox squirrel can hide anything between 3 to 10,000 nuts in different places every season. To remember where it's hidden those stashes, it builds up a mental map of its surroundings. This requires so much brainpower, it's thought it actually causes the squirrel's brain to grow in size during prime, nut-hoarding season. The ability to store food has created a virtual lifeline for so many animals, but for others, that strategy simply isn't an option. They've got to approach it in an entirely different way, and that's resulted in some of the greatest natural spectacles on Earth. BIRDS SQUAWK As winter closes in, millions of animals are on the move... ..in the air... ..the sea... ..and on land. They embark on these epic migrations in search of new food sources, or to escape the harsh weather. Caribou, known in Europe as reindeer. In North America, these incredibly resilient animals travel to their wintering grounds in huge numbers. There can be close to 200,000 in one herd. Majestic narwhals spend their summers in the coastal waters of the Arctic, but when winter approaches, the whales head far out to sea. Here, these almost-mythical creatures find food deep beneath the surface, coming up to breathe through holes in the ice. And in Alaska, hundreds of thousands of sandhill cranes head south to Mexico, over 3,000 miles away. Cranes are one of the oldest bird families on Earth and it's thought that they've been making journeys like this for millions of years. It's an arduous flight, but they must persevere in order to survive. CRANE CALLS Not all animals flee the tightening grasp of winter, however. In fact, one Arctic specialist is eagerly awaiting its arrival... ..the polar bear... ..basking in the last rays of autumn sunshine. Here in the Canadian Arctic, the bears are gathering at the coast, waiting for the sea to freeze so that they can hunt on the ice. Their main prey is ringed and bearded seals, but they spend much of their time out at sea and the bears need the ice as a platform to reach them. The bears must bide their time on the land. Over the summer, they live off their fat reserves, but now these are dwindling. Many bears turn to eating plants, roots and berries, but it's not enough to sustain them. And as our climate changes, winter sea ice forms later in the year and is reducing, leaving the bears to survive on these meagre rations for even longer. Polar bears are usually solitary animals, so seeing them together like this is rare. For them, it's a chance to size up future rivals, but it also uses up valuable energy reserves. At last, the wait is over... ..the ice is on its way. With the arrival of deep winter, much of the planet undergoes a magical transformation. As temperatures plummet... ..lakes and rivers freeze... ..and snowflakes dance in the air. Landscapes become winter wonderlands. But now, life is much tougher. And one of the biggest challenges animals face is finding food. Snow acts as an obvious barrier to the food lying beneath it and it's often much deeper than this, many metres in depth, so any animals looking for vegetation or any small rodents beneath it all are going to have a very hard time reaching it. Not only that, but snow is excellent at absorbing sound waves... ..effectively acting as a layer of sound proofing and stopping any animals that rely on their hearing from detecting their prey. Now, in the Rocky Mountains of North America is an animal that is harnessing all of its skills to overcome these challenges. In this imposing mountain range, the snow can lie in huge drifts. This is home to a particularly elusive cat... ..the bobcat, a species of lynx. To survive in these conditions, it's always on the lookout for its next meal. Bobcats have evolved excellent hearing with ears that can swivel back and forth independently of one another in order to pinpoint any noise coming from their prey. And those characteristic ear tufts are thought to amplify the sound. But the deeper the snow, the harder this task is. Even the experts don't always get it quite right. Perhaps the river can provide an opportunity. It's fed by volcanic hot springs, so it never freezes over. It's a refuge of warmth, which draws in animals from miles around. The bobcat's preferred diet is rabbit and hare, but it's a resourceful cat and will try its luck with almost anything. Although this one doesn't seem to be very keen on getting its paws wet. It needs to find a suitable target. DUCKS QUACK No luck this time. But these determined cats are masters of perseverance. With those finely-tuned ears, perhaps this bobcat has caught the faintest of sounds beneath the snow. Its paws are soft and well-padded. Using the boulders as stepping stones, it can move without making a sound. In this particular game of cat and mouse, there's a clear winner. To overcome the problem of finding food in deep snow, one group of animals is using a different strategy - changing its diet in winter. As herbivores, deer feed on grasses and other vegetation on the ground and then browse the leaves of trees and shrubs, so when winter arrives, their food is often hidden deep beneath the snow or has died back. Now, in this wildlife park, these deer are being given supplementary food, but in the wild, deer have to become much more resourceful. This is the Shiretoko Peninsula in the far north of Japan, where snow covers the mountain peaks for eight months of the year. It's home to an incredibly tenacious animal - the sika deer. At this time of year, there's little to eat in these snowbound forests. Just getting around in these conditions is difficult enough and to add to the challenge, many of the females are pregnant, due to give birth in the spring. To find food, the deer dig down through the snow using their hooves, looking for any vegetation that might be available. But during harsh winters, sika deer are able to adapt their diets to add another food source that can be found more easily... ..tree bark. Perhaps surprisingly, tree bark does have some nutritional value. But deer are only able to survive on bark because of how their digestive system has evolved. Deer stomachs are made up of four compartments containing special enzymes that allow them to digest plants and twigs and bark and to break down cellulose, a tough material that stands in the way of all the nutritious stuff. But not only is bark especially difficult to digest, it also contains tannins, which can be toxic. Deer have overcome this by producing a special protein in their saliva that neutralises the tannins, rendering them harmless - a remarkable adaptation that allows them to make the most of the scant food available. WOLF HOWLS WOLVES HOWL All around the world, animals must be resourceful and creative to secure the food they need in winter. Wolves work together to hunt large prey like bison that could keep the whole pack going for weeks. Voles burrow under the snow to reach the vegetation they need. And bald eagles will fiercely fight off any competition. EAGLE SCREECHES It's not easy staying well-fed in winter... ..and animals that can adapt to new circumstances will be the ones to come out on top. The Arctic fox can cope with sub-zero winter temperatures in the extreme north thanks to its thick white fur coat. It's an accomplished hunter, feeding mostly on lemmings and voles. But it's a constant struggle to get enough food. Here in Alaska, new opportunities are presenting themselves. TRUCK HORN BLASTS The town of Deadhorse is one of the most remote settlements on Earth, more than 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle. The Arctic fox knows there's food to be found here. But it will need to be careful. Not only does it have to avoid humans and machinery... ..but red foxes live here too. They've also been lured into town by the promise of sustenance. The Arctic fox's sense of smell is leading it towards much-needed food. But the red fox is twice its size and could easily kill it. The Arctic fox has found what it was looking for. This frozen meal of scraps is enough to keep him going. This intrepid little mammal is successfully exploiting a new world to survive. And it also has the uncanny ability to vanish into the Arctic landscape thanks to its white coat. But he's not the only winter animal to use this disappearing act. The Yukon is the coldest place in North America. Temperatures can fall to minus 63 degrees Celsius and snow covers the ground for five months a year. This provides a distinct advantage for one of its residents, if you can find it... ..the snowshoe hare. It's fur perfectly matches this white world. But the hare doesn't look like this all year round. Throughout the spring and summer months, its fur is reddish brown to match its habitat at this time of year, but as winter approaches and the snow starts to fall, it transforms from brown to purest white. Snowshoe hares have many predators, from coyotes to golden eagles... ..and lynx. LYNX GROWLS So the hare's winter white coat makes for an excellent camouflage. With its perfect disguise, even out in the open, it can still remain hidden from the sharpest eyes. And if it thinks it's been spotted, it has a getaway plan. The aptly-named snowshoe hare has especially large furry paws, which stop it from sinking into the snow... ..and help it to be fast and nimble and leap three metres in a single bound. With all these impressive adaptations and a little bit of luck, the snowshoe hare will live to see another day. Only a few species, like this least weasel, have this special ability to turn white in winter. But how does this changing colour work? Colour in the fur and feathers of animals is all down to a pigment called melanin that's produced by specialised cells in the skin and a combination of different types of this pigment creates a whole range of colours. Now, white fur and feathers don't contain this melanin pigment. And the really clever bit is that animals that can change colour switch off melanin production as they grow their glorious white winter coats. This remarkable change is triggered by day length. As the days shorten before winter, these animals shed their darker coats and gradually grow their new winter ones. It's also thought that white fur might be more insulating than dark fur. Because it doesn't have any melanin, it's hollow and contains more trapped air in it. Trapped air equals greater insulation and warmth... ..making this transformation a vital adaptation for surviving winter. Polar bears, on the other hand, keep their magnificent white coats all year round. Out on the ice, conditions are some of the harshest on Earth. The bears face high winds and temperatures of minus 50 degrees Celsius. Their insulating white fur provides their main protection. But in this frozen world, even these coats aren't enough to keep them warm... ..so polar bears have a dense layer of blubber beneath their fur that can be up to ten centimetres thick. This also protects them as they hunt for seals... ..often having to swim between the ice floes... ..their huge paws acting as paddles. The combination of this layer of fat and thick white fur means that polar bears lose very little heat to the environment. Now, we have a thermal imaging camera trained on me at the moment to show you what I mean. Now, these cameras show up hot objects as white or yellow or orange, and then cold objects as purples and dark blues and even blacks. Now you can see, even though I've got loads of layers on, I'm mostly orange and then my face is really yellow, as are my hands, because I've got hand warmers in my gloves, but it goes to show how much heat I am losing to the air around me. Now, if we look at a thermal image of a polar bear, it's a very different picture altogether. The polar bear is mostly dark blues with just a little bit of light at its extremities like its nose, where it's losing a tiny bit of heat, but that just goes to show polar bears lose hardly any heat at all, making it one of the most resilient animals on the planet. This is Valdez Harbour in Alaska, a winter refuge for a charismatic little creature. Sea otters spend nearly their whole lives on the water. But unlike polar bears and other marine mammals, they don't have a layer of blubber for insulation... ..so they have evolved the thickest fur coat of any animal. The outer layer is made up of long waterproof hairs... ..while underneath, there's a short, dense underfur layer. This keeps cold water completely away from the skin. This female has an extra challenge on her hands. PUP MEWLS Sea otters can give birth all year round and this is not ideal timing. To keep her pup warm, she has to groom it constantly. She also blows air into its fur - the fluffier it is, the warmer it will be. When it's a little older, she takes it out to sea to hunt. To find food, she has to leave it at the surface. PUP MEWLS But thanks to its fluffy coat and especially large lung capacity, it's so buoyant, it just won't sink. PUP MEWLS When she surfaces, its cries lead her back so she can feed it too. The evolution of thick winter coats is yet another exquisite adaptation that allows animals to withstand the coldest temperatures, but even then, that may not be quite enough. But nature always finds a way, and some species have developed a very different, but equally effective, survival strategy. In the frozen mountain forests of southern China, 2,500 metres above sea level, lives an astonishing animal. Rarely seen, this is the highest-living monkey in the world - the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey. These monkeys have developed some remarkable adaptations to cope with the freezing temperatures of their Himalayan home. Their noses are almost completely flat to avoid getting frostbite... ..and they're covered in dense fur that can be up to 15 centimetres long. But in this heavy snowfall, even this isn't enough... ..so they do something very clever. Snub-nosed monkeys are social animals who live in large family groups. As night approaches, they gather together amongst the branches of trees. Mothers and babies are usually at the centre with all the other members of the family surrounding them. They'll stay huddled like this until morning. In this bitter cold, they simply wouldn't survive the night on their own. So what's the science behind huddling? Exactly how does it work? Well, we have a thermal imaging camera trained on me to help explain exactly what's going on. Now, heat is a thermal energy that's constantly flowing around us and as it flows, it naturally moves from hotter objects to colder objects. To show you what I mean, I'm going to fill this solitary mug in the snow with some hot chocolate. Now, you can see it's hot - white or yellow in the centre - but very quickly, it's losing that heat to the colder air around it, but if I fill... ..all of these mugs of chocolate huddled together like our monkeys... ..we should be able to see something very different is happening. All of the mugs are losing their heat much less quickly, particularly the one in the centre and that's because it's protected by the hot mugs around it, but also, it's gaining some heat from the collective huddle that's hotter than it is. Therefore, the heat is transferring to that mug in the centre. In just a few minutes, you can clearly see the difference, can't you? This cup is now completely cold, having lost all its heat to the elements, while this one is nice and cosy and warm in the centre. Now, in the Antarctic, one particular species is using this huddling strategy in such a beautifully complex way that scientists are only just beginning to fully understand it. Emperor penguins are one of nature's great survivors. They can endure the extreme cold of an Antarctic winter where temperatures can plummet to minus 40 degrees Celsius. And the key to their survival is how they huddle together. One by one, the male emperor penguins lock themselves together in a tightly-packed group to keep warm and shelter from the intense winds. These huddles can contain as many as 4,000 penguins. And they are constantly moving - those on the outside push forward to get closer to the warmth in the centre of the group and away from the full force of the Antarctic storms. But the penguins on the inside of the huddle also move around to stop themselves from getting too warm. Recent studies have shown that temperatures at the centre can reach an incredible 37 degrees Celsius... ..so the penguins move away to avoid overheating, with others replacing them. It's one of the most phenomenal examples of cooperation in nature and a vital strategy for the emperor penguins' survival. Bracing yourself against everything that winter throws at you in such a sophisticated way is testament to just how resilient and awe-inspiring nature is, but nature is also incredibly versatile and other animals are avoiding the onslaught of winter altogether. To save energy when food is in short supply, some animals go into hibernation. After feeding up in the autumn, hedgehogs find a cosy den. Here, they fall into a state of inactivity, which can last all winter. Their body temperature drops, their heart rate slows and they live off their fat reserves for about four months. When winter arrives in North America, the Arctic ground squirrel retreats beneath the frozen ground... ..where it will sleep for an astounding eight months. A thermal camera inside a filming burrow shows how the squirrel's body temperature cools. It can drop to a staggering three degrees below freezing. Its major organs shut down almost entirely, but every few weeks, it shivers and its muscles send a flow of warm blood around its body, rebooting its brain. It will do this about a dozen times during the winter until finally, it's time to wake up again. Bats are another group of animals that are known to hibernate and new research has revealed that one particular species - the Ussurian tube-nosed bat from Japan, no bigger than the size of my palm - may hibernate in the snow. For many years, their whereabouts during the harsh winters remained a mystery, but now it's thought that when temperatures drop and the first snows fall, they leave their roosts in the cavities of trees and the crevices of rocks and settle onto that snow. As more snow falls, they become covered and surrounded, their tiny movements creating a cavity with much more stable temperatures than their tree roosts, exposed to the elements, and there they'll remain in what's called a super-cooled torpor or deep sleep. It's believed they'll stay there until the snow melts, potentially hibernating in their cavities all the way through to the spring. The shortest day of the year occurs at the end of December in the Northern Hemisphere. It's known as the winter solstice. Gradually, days begin to lengthen and some animals start planning for the future. The Himalayas, home to one of the planet's most majestic and elusive creatures... ..the snow leopard. Living in the world's highest mountains, this big cat's home range can be as large as 400 square miles. These cats are endangered. Scientists estimate there may be as few as 4,000 left in the wild. So the odds are well and truly stacked against them when it comes to finding a potential mate in this winter landscape. But this snow leopard doesn't seem to be too fazed by the challenge. He has a tried-and-tested strategy. First, he patrols the well-worn tracks of his territory over and over again. This is his patch, but it might overlap with the territory of a female and, with any luck, their paths will cross. Next, he uses scent marking to advertise his presence. Snow leopards scent mark their territory by spraying urine and scent chemicals and rubbing scent glands against rocks or patches of earth. He also checks for the scent of any potential mates who may have passed by. He's very diligent, sometimes spraying as many as 20 times an hour. He wouldn't want to miss his chance. Scent marking and detecting is a crucial part of the lives of snow leopards. It's how they communicate as solitary animals and it's incredibly important when it's time to breed. Snow leopards may have tens of millions of scent receptors. We humans only have a paltry five million. Their ability to detect different chemicals in a scent mark is nothing short of extraordinary. It can take a snow leopard over a week to cover his entire territory, walking hundreds of miles in search of a mate. Not even the deepest snow will stop him. At last, his determination pays off, he picks up the scent of a female. Eagerly, he rubs his own scent over the scent she has left to declare his presence and interest. He may be able to smell the marks of the female, but now he needs to find her. Then, across the mountains, comes the cry of a female snow leopard. SNOW LEOPARD CALLS IN DISTANCE He returns the call. If they do finally meet, these rare leopards will have a chance to add to the next generation... ..and with such low population numbers, every new litter of cubs is precious. SNOW LEOPARD CALLS As the snow begins to melt... ..and the sun's rays become stronger, spring will soon be on its way. But what causes these dramatic changes between the seasons? It's all down to the fact that planet Earth is tilted 23.5 degrees off its axis. So when it's winter in the northern hemisphere, where we are in the UK and where I am here in Austria, the planet is in this position and it's tilted away from the sun, which means in the northern hemisphere, days are shorter and it's colder, but as the Earth moves around the sun... ..over 365 days, spinning on its own axis every 24 hours, obviously, as it hits spring around here and then summer here, you can see the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, which means days are longer and warmer. Now, if our planet wasn't tilted at all, we simply wouldn't have any seasons and the Earth would be a very different place indeed. High in the northern hemisphere, with the arrival of spring, Arctic ground squirrels are beginning to stir from their very deep sleep. It takes three hours for them to heat up and a full day for their entire bodies to be fully functional again. As soon as they're up and about, males spring straight into action. SQUIRREL CHIRPS First, this male needs to reclaim his territory. SQUIRREL CHIRPS He sees off any rivals. He's ready for the most important day of his year. Female Arctic ground squirrels emerge a few days after the males. He needs to look his best... ..but he mustn't miss his chance. Females are only fertile for 12 hours each year. SQUIRREL CHIRPS He approaches her cautiously. He doesn't want to scare her off. But what will she make of him? He politely taps a greeting... ..and she returns the gesture. THEY CHIRP He can't afford to be complacent. She could go in search of another partner at any time, so he won't leave her side for 24 hours. And with any luck, the circle of life will start all over again. While some animals are beginning to pair up, others are already a few steps ahead. CALF BLEATS CUB GRUNTS CHICK CALLS Arctic fox cubs emerge from their den at just over three weeks old. Their mother has her work cut out with six... ..but they can have up to 14 cubs in a single litter, the most of any of the fox family. Weddell seal pups are born straight onto the ice. They'll double in weight in just the first week and soon after, they'll take their first swim. Young wild goats make the journey to their spring pastures when they're only a few weeks old... ..following their mothers, who'll protect them for the first year of their life. Young animals everywhere are out exploring their new world and the rising temperatures are enough to put a spring in everyone's step. The last places to feel the full effects of spring are the poles and beneath the snow in the Arctic, new life is emerging. CUB GRIZZLES These polar bear cubs are just two months old. They were born beneath the snow while their mother lay in her deep winter sleep. They're seeing the world for the first time. CUB GRUNTS They need to find their feet... ..and mum is on hand to help. CUB GRIZZLES After five months in hibernation, this is a chance to stretch her legs. Following the long winter, a mother bear's first task is to find food. She's headed for the sea ice to hunt, before it melts fully in a few months' time. Polar bears are dedicated and protective mothers. CUB CALLS They keep their cubs close and call to them when they wander too far. POLAR BEAR ROARS CUBS CALL Over the next two years, she will teach her cubs to swim and to hunt and how to survive the challenging Arctic winters by themselves. Until then, as they step out into a new year, she will always be at their side. POLAR BEAR GROWLS CUB GRIZZLES MOTHER BEAR GROWLS From the first frosts to the first thaws, our animals have developed remarkable adaptations... ..from making sure they have enough food... ..to staying as warm as possible in the coldest months. The strategies they've evolved to survive and thrive in our winter wonderlands make for some of the most inspirational stories from the natural world.
