She isn't coming yet, Toto. Did she hurt you? She tried to, didn't she? Come on, we'll go tell Uncle Henry and Auntie Em. Come on, Toto. Aunt Em! Aunt Em! Aunt Em, just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto… Dorothy please, we're try’n to count. - But Aunt Em, she hit him… - Don't bother us now, honey. This old incubator's gone bad and we're likely to lose a lot of our chicks. That poor little thing. But Aunt Em, Miss Gulch hit Toto right over the back with a rake just because she says he gets in her garden and chases her nasty old cat every day! …70. Dorothy, please! But he doesn't do it every day! Just once or twice a week. And he can't catch her old cat anyway. - And now she says she's gonna get the Sheriff… - Dorothy, Dorothy, we're busy. All right. - How's she coming? - Take it easy. You got my finger! Well why don’t you get your finger outta the way. - There you are. - Right on my finger! Lucky thing it wasn't your head. Zeke, what am I gonna do about Miss Gulch? Just because Toto chases her ‘ol cat… Listen honey, I got them hogs to get in. Now look it Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch. You'd think you didn't have any brains at all. - I have so got brains. - Well, why don't you use them? When you come home, don't you go by Miss Gulch's place. Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble, see? Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all. Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know. Say, get in there before I make a dime bank outta ya. Listen kid, are you gonna let that old Gulch heifer try and buffalo ya? She ain't noth’n to be afraid of. Have a little courage, that’s all. I'm not afraid of her. Then the next time she squawks, walk up to her and spit in her eye. That's what I'd do. Zeke! Help! Help me, Zeke! Get me outta here! Help! - Are you all right, Dorothy? - Yes, I'm all right. I fell in, and Zeke… Why Zeke, you're just as scared as I am. What a matter, gonna let a little ‘ol pig make a coward out of ya? Look at you Zeke, you’re just as white… Here, what's all this jabber-walk’n when there's work to be done? I know of 3 shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it… Well, Dorothy was walk’n along… I saw you tinkering with that contraption Hickory. - Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon. - All right Mrs. Gale, but someday they're gonna erect a statue to me in this town, and… Well, don't start posing for it now. Here. Here. Can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers. - Gosh, Mrs. Gale. - Just fried. You see, Dorothy toppled into the… It's no place for Dorothy around a pigsty! Now, you go feed those hogs before they worry themselves into anemia! - Yes. - Auntie Em, really, you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto? - She said she was gonna - Now, Dorothy dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing. Now you just help us out today and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble. Someplace where there isn't any trouble. Do you suppose there is such a place, Toto? There must be. It's not a place you can get to by a boat or a train. It's far, far away.

I want to see you and your wife right away about Dorothy. - Dorothy? Well what has Dorothy done? - What's she done? I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg! - You mean, she bit you? - No, her dog! She bit her dog, eh? No. That dog's a menace to the community. I'm take’n him to the Sheriff and make sure he's destroyed. Destroyed! Toto? You can't! You mustn't! Auntie Em! Uncle Henry! You won't let her, will ya? Of course we won't. Will we Em? Please, Aunt Em! Toto didn’t mean to. He didn't know he was doing anything wrong. I'm the one that ought to be punished. I let him go in her garden. You can send me to bed without supper. If you don’t hand over that dog, I'll bring a damned suit that'll take your whole farm! There’s a law that protects them folks against dogs that bite! How would it be if she keeps him tied up? He's really gentle. - With gentle people, that is. - That's for the Sheriff to decide. Here’s his order allow’n me to take him. Unless you wanna go against the law. Hm, yes. We can't go against the law. I'm afraid poor Toto has to go. - Now you're seeing reason. - No. Here's what I'm taking him in, so he can't attack me again. No, No! I won't let you take him! - You go away. I'll bite you myself! - Dorothy! You wicked old witch! Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let ‘em take Toto. - Don’t let her take him, please! - I've got an order! - Let me have him! - Please stop her! Put him in the basket, Henry. - The idea! - Don't, Uncle Henry. Toto! Almira Gulch, just because you own half the county doesn't mean you have the power to run the rest of us! For 23 years I've been dying to tell you what I thought of you! And now… well, being a Christian woman, I can't say it! Toto, darling! I got you back! You came back! I'm so glad! They'll be coming back for you in a minute. We've got to get away! We've got to run away! Well, well, well! Houseguests? And who might you be? No, no, no now, don't tell me. Let's see. You're… you're traveling in disguise. No, that's not right. You're… you're going on a visit. No, I'm wrong. Let's see what we… You're… you're running away. How did you guess? Professor Marvel never guesses, he knows. Now, why are you running away? No, no now, don't tell me. They… they don't understand you at home. They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands. Big cities, big mountains, big oceans. Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me. Toto, that's not polite! We haven't been asked yet. He's perfectly welcome. As one dog to another. Now let's see, where were we? Please Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the crowned heads of Europe? Do you know any? You mean the thing, yes. Well… I… I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's go inside here. We'll… just come along, I'll show you. That's right. Here. Sit right down here. That's it. This… this is the same genuine, magic, authentic crystal used by the Priests of Isis and Osiris in the days of the Pharaohs of Egypt in which Cleopatra first saw the approach of Julius Caesar and Marc Anthony. and so on, and so on. Now… you… you'd better close your eyes, my child, for a moment in order to be better in tune with the infinite. We can't do these things without reaching out into the infinite. Yes, that's all right now, you can open them. We'll gaze into the crystal. What's this I see? A house with a picket fence and a barn with a weathervane of a running horse. - That's our farm! - Yes. Yes. There’s a… there's a woman. She's… she’s wearing a polka-dot dress. Her face is careworn. That's Aunt Em. Yes. Her name is Emily. That's right. What's she doing? Well, I can't quite see. Why, she's crying. Someone has hurt her. Someone has just about broken her heart. Me? Well, it's… it's someone she loves very much. Someone she's been very kind to. Someone she's taken care of in sickness. I had the measles once, and she stayed right by me every minute. What's she doing now? Yes, she's… what's this? Why, she's… she’s putting her hand on her heart! She's… she’s dropping down on the bed. Well, that's all. The crystal's gone dark. You don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? - I've gotta go home right away. - But what’s this? I thought you were going along with me. No, no! I have to get to her right away! Come on, Toto! Come on! Goodbye, Professor Marvel. And thanks a lot! Better get under cover, Sylvester. There’s a storm's blowing up. A whopper, to speak in the vernacular of the peasantry. Poor little kid. I hope she gets home all right. Get them horses loose! Where's Hickory? Hickory? Doggone it! It's a twister! It's a twister! Dorothy! Dorothy! Everybody in the storm cellar! Henry, I can't find Dorothy! She's out in the storm! We can't look for her now. Come on, get in the cellar! Hurry up! Auntie Em! Auntie Em? Auntie Em! Auntie Em! Uncle Henry! Auntie Em! We must be up inside the cyclone! Miss Gulch! Toto… I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore. We must be over the rainbow! Now I know we're not in Kansas. Are you a good witch or a bad witch? Who, me? Why, I'm not a witch at all. I'm Dorothy Gale, from Kansas. Well, is that the witch? Who, Toto? Toto's my dog. I'm a little muddled. The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East. And there's the house, and here you are and that's all that's left of the Wicked Witch of the East. And so, what the Munchkins want to know is, are you a good witch or a bad witch? But I've already told you, I'm not a witch at all. Witches are old and ugly. What was that? The Munchkins. They're laughing because I am a witch. I'm Glinda, the Witch of the North. You are? I beg your pardon! But I've never heard of a beautiful witch before. Only bad witches are ugly. The Munchkins are happy because you freed them - from the Wicked Witch of the East. - But if you please, what are Munchkins? The little people who live in this land. It's Munchkinland and you are their national heroine, my dear. It's all right.

No. No, it was an accident. I didn't mean to kill anybody. Well, my little pretty, I can cause accidents too! - Aren't you forgetting the ruby slippers? - The slippers, yes! The slippers! They're gone! The ruby slippers! What have you done with them? Give them back to me or I'll… It's too late! There they are, and there they'll stay! Give me back my slippers! I’m the only one that knows how to use them. They're of no use to you. Give them back to me. Give them back! Keep tight inside of them. Their magic must be very powerful or she wouldn't want them so badly. Stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well! Rubbish! You have no power here. Begone, before somebody drops a house on you too. Very well. I'll bide my time. And as for you, my fine lady, it's true I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like. But just try to stay out of my way! Just try! I'll get you, my pretty and your little dog too! It's all right. You can get up. She's gone! It's all right. You can all get up. What a smell of sulfur! I'm afraid you've made an enemy of the Wicked Witch. The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear. Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether. But which is the way back to Kansas? I can't go the way I came. No, that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself. The Wizard of Oz? Is he good or is he wicked? Very good, but very mysterious. He lives in the Emerald City, a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you? - No, I'm afraid I didn't. - Well then, you'll have to walk. The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland. And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West. But how do I start for Emerald City? It's always best to start at the beginning. And all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road. - But what happens if I… - Just follow the Yellow Brick Road. Goodbye! My!

Wasn't he pointing the other way? Of course, people do go both ways. Why, you did say something, didn't you? Are you doing that on purpose, or can't you make up your mind? That's the trouble. I can't make up my mind. I haven't got a brain. Only straw. How can you talk if you haven't got a brain? I don't know. But some people without brains do an awful lot of talking, don't they? Yes, I guess you're right. Well, we haven't really met properly, have we? Why, no. - How do you do? - How do you do? - Very well, thank you. - I'm not feeling at all well. You see, it's very tedious being stuck up here all day long with a pole up your back. Oh dear, that must be terribly uncomfortable. Can't you get down? Down?

No, I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again. My! It’s good to be free! Did I scare ya? No, no, I just thought you hurt yourself. - But I didn't scare ya? - No, of course not. I didn't think so. Boo! Scat! Boo! You see? I can't even scare a crow. They come from miles around just to eat in my field and laugh in my face. I’m a failure, because I haven't got a brain!

Do you think if I went with you, this wizard would give me brains? I couldn't say. But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now. - Yes, that's true. - But maybe you better not. I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble. Witch? I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything! - Except a lighted match. - I don't blame you for that. But I’d face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains. Look, I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing. And I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.

It's the Wicked Witch! What'll we do? Help! Help! It's no use screaming at a time like this. Nobody will hear you! Help! Help! Help! It's snowing! No, it isn't. Yes, it is! Maybe that'll help! But it couldn't help! It does help! Dorothy, you're waking up! Unusual weather we're having, ain't it? Look! He's rusted again. - Give me the oilcan, quick! - Here. - He is rusted. - Here. - Here. - Quick! Curses! Curses! Somebody always helps that girl. But shoes or no shoes, I'm still great enough to conquer her. And woe to those who try to stop me! Come on, let's get outta here. Look!

If you please sir, we wanna see the Wizard right away, all 4 of us. Orders are, nobody can see the great Oz! Not nobody! Not no how! But… but please, it’s very important! I got a permanent just for the occasion. Not nobody! Not no how! But she's Dorothy! The Witch's Dorothy? Well, that makes a difference. Just wait here. I'll announce you at once. Did you hear that? He'll announce us at once. - I’ve as good as got my brain. - I can fairly hear my heart beating. I'll be home in time for supper. In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest.

Courage! What makes a King out of a slave? Courage! What makes the flag on the mast to wave? Courage! What makes the elephant charge his tusk in the misty mist or the dusky dusk? What makes the muskrat guard his musk? Courage! What makes the sphinx the 7th Wonder? Courage! What makes the dawn come up like thunder? Courage! What makes the Hottentot so hot? What puts the "ape" in apricot? What have they got that I ain't got? - Courage! - You can say that again. The Wizard says go away! Go away? Looks like we came a long way for nothing. And I was so happy. I thought I was on my way home. Don't cry Dorothy, we're gonna get you to the Wizard. We certainly are. Auntie Em was so good to me and I never appreciated it. Running away and hurting her feelings. Professor Marvel said she was sick. She may be dying and it's all my fault. I'll never forgive myself. Never, never, never. Please don't cry anymore. I'll get you into the Wizard somehow. Come on. I had an Aunt Em myself once. Wait a minute, fellas. I was just think’n, I really don't wanna see the Wizard this much. I’d better wait for you outside. - What's the matter? - He's just scared again. Don't you know the Wizard’s gonna give you some courage? I'd be too scared to ask him for it. Well then, we'll ask him for you. I'd sooner wait outside. Why? Why? Because I'm still scared! - What happened? - Somebody pulled my tail. You did it yourself. Here. Come on. Come forward! Tell me when it's over! Look at that. Look at that! I wanna go home! I am Oz the great and powerful! Who are you? Who are you? If you please, I am Dorothy, the small and meek. We've come to ask you… Silence! Jiminy crickets! The great and powerful Oz knows why you have come. Step forward Tin Man! You dare to come to me for a heart, do you? You clinking, clanking, clattering collection of caliginous junk! Yes, sir. Yes, Your Honor. You see a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and… Quiet! And you, Scarecrow, have the effrontery to ask for a brain, you billowing bale of bovine fodder! Yes, Your Honor. I mean, Your Excellency. I mean, Your Wizardry! Enough! And you, Lion! Well? You ought to be ashamed of yourself frightening him like that when he came to you for help! Silence, whippersnapper! The beneficent Oz has every intention of granting your requests. What's that? What'd he say? Huh? What'd he say? But first, you must prove yourselves worthy by performing a very small task. Bring me the broomstick of the Witch of the West. But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it. Bring me her broomstick and I’ll grant your requests. Now go! But what if she kills us first? I said go! "I'd turn back if I were you." I believe there's spooks around here. That's ridiculous! Spooks. That's silly. Don't you believe in spooks? No. Why, only… Are you all right? I do believe in spooks. I do, I do, I do, I do. I do believe in spooks. I do, I do, I do, I do, I do! You'll believe in more than that before I’m finished with you. Take your army to the haunted forest and bring me that girl and her dog. Do what you like with the others, but I want her alive and unharmed. They'll give you no trouble, I promise you that. I've sent a little insect on ahead to take the fight out of them. Take special care of those ruby slippers. I want those most of all. Now, fly! Fly! Bring me that girl and her slippers! Fly! Fly! Fly! Help! Help! Go away now! Toto! Toto! Help! Help! Help! Help! What’s happened to you? They tore my legs off and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out and they threw it over there! Well, that's you all over. They sure knocked the stuffin’s outta ya, didn’t they. Don't stand there gawking, put me together. We've got to find Dorothy! Now, let's see… What a nice little dog. And you, my dear, what an unexpected pleasure. It's so kind of you to visit me in my loneliness. What are you gonna do with my dog? Give him back to me! All in good time, my little pretty. - All in good time. - Please give me back my dog. Certainly, certainly when you give me those slippers. - But the Good Witch told me not to. - Very well. Throw that basket in the river and drown him. No, here! You can have your old slippers, but give me back Toto! That's a good little girl. I knew you'd see reason! I'm sorry! I didn't do it. Can I still have my dog? No! Fool that I am, I should have remembered those slippers will never come off as long as you're alive. But that's not what's worrying me, it's how to do it. These things must be done delicately or you hurt the spell. - Run, Toto, run! - Catch him, you fool! Run, Toto, run! Run, Toto, run! He got away! He got away! Which is more than you will! Drat, you and your dog! You've been more trouble to me than you're worth, one way or another! But it'll soon be over now! Do you see that? That's how much longer you've got to be alive. And it isn't long, my pretty. It isn't long! I can't wait forever to get those shoes! I'm frightened. I'm frightened, Auntie Em! I'm frightened. Dorothy! Dorothy! Where are you? It's me. It’s Auntie Em. We're trying to find you. Where are you? I'm here in Oz, Auntie Em. I'm locked up in the Witch's castle and I’m trying to get home to you, Auntie Em! Oh, Auntie Em, don't go away! I'm frightened! Come back! Come back! "Auntie Em, Auntie Em! Come back!" I'll give you Auntie Em, my pretty! Look! There's Toto. Where'd he come from? Why, don't you see? He’s come to take us to Dorothy. Come on, fellas! I hope my strength holds out. I hope your tail holds out. What's that? What's that? That's the castle of the Wicked Witch. - Dorothy's in that awful place? - I hate to think of her in there. - We've got to get her out. - Don't cry now. We haven't got the oil can, and you've been squeaking enough as it is. Who's them? Who's them? - I’ve got a plan how to get in there. - Fine, he's got a plan. And you're gonna lead us. - Me? - Yes, you. - I… I… I gotta get her outta there? - That's right. All right, I’ll go in there for Dorothy. Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch guards or no guards, I'll tear ‘em apart. I may not come out alive, but I'm go’n in there. - There's only one thing I want you fellas to do. - What's that? Talk me out of it. - No, you don't! - Oh, no. - Now, wait a minute. - Up! Come on, I’ve got another idea. Do you think it would be polite, dropping in like this? Where do we go now? There! Wait! We better make sure. Dorothy, are you in there? - It’s us! - Yes! It's me! She's locked me in! We gotta get her out! Open the door! Hurry! Please hurry! The hourglass is almost empty! Stand back! Toto! Toto! Lion! I knew you'd come! I knew you would! Hurry, we've got no time to lose! Going so soon? I wouldn't hear of it. Why, my little party's just beginning. Trapped. Trapped like mice… rats. That's right. Don't hurt them right away. We'll let them think about it a little first. Seize them! Seize them! Stop them, you fools! Seize them! Seize them! There they go! Now we've got them! Half of you go this way, half of you go that way. Hurry! Hurry! Where do we go now? This way. Come on! Back! Back! Well! Ring-around the rosie, a pocket full of spears! Thought you'd be pretty foxy, didn't you? Well, the last to go will see the first 3 go before her. And her mangy little dog too! How about a little fire, Scarecrow? Help! I'm burning! I’m burning! It's burning! Help! Don't throw that water! You cursed brat! Look what you've done! I'm melting! Melting! Oh, what a world! What a world! Who would've thought a good little girl like you could destroy my beautiful wickedness? Look out! Look out! I'm going. She's dead. You've killed her. I didn't mean to kill her. Really, I didn't. It's just that he was on fire. Hail to Dorothy! The Wicked Witch is dead! Hail! Hail to Dorothy! The Wicked Witch is dead! The broom. - May we have it? - Please, and take it with you. Thank you so much! Now we can go back to the Wizard and tell him the Wicked Witch is dead! The Wicked Witch is dead! Can I believe my eyes? Why have you come back? Please, sir. We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West. We melted her. You liquidated her, eh? - Very resourceful. - Yes, sir. So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir. Not so fast. Not so fast! I'll have to give the matter a little thought. Go away and come back tomorrow. Tomorrow? But I wanna go home now! You've had plenty of time already. Do not arouse the wrath of the great and powerful Oz! I said come back tomorrow! If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises. Do you presume to criticize the great Oz? You ungrateful creatures! Think yourselves lucky that I'm giving you audience tomorrow instead of 20 years from now! The great Oz has spoken! Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain. The great and… Oz has spoken. Who are you? I am the great and powerful Wizard of Oz. You are? I don't believe you. I'm afraid it's true. There’s no other Wizard except me. You humbug! Yes, that's exactly so. I’m a humbug. You're a very bad man! No, my dear. I’m a very good man. I'm just a very bad wizard. What about the heart you promised Tin Man? And the courage you promised Cowardly Lion? - And Scarecrow's brain? - And Scarecrow's brain? Why, anybody can have a brain. That's a very mediocre commodity. Every pusillanimous creature that crawls on the earth or slinks through slimy seas has a brain. Back where I come from, we have universities, seats of great learning, where men go to become great thinkers. And when they come out, they think deep thoughts, and with no more brains than you have. But they have one thing you haven't got, a diploma. Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me, by the Universitatus Committeeatum E Pluribus Unum I hereby confer upon you - the honorary degree of Th.D. - Th.D.? That's Doctor of Thinkology. The sum of the square roots of any 2 sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side. Joy! Rapture! I've got a brain! - How can I ever thank you enough? - Well, you can't. As for you, my fine friend, you're a victim of disorganized thinking. You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger you have no courage. You're confusing courage with wisdom. Back where I come from, we have men who are called "heroes." Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city. And they have no more courage than you have. But they have one thing that you haven't got, a medal. Therefore, for meritorious conduct, extraordinary valor, conspicuous bravery against wicked witches, I award you the Triple Cross. You are now a member of the Legion of Courage. Shucks folks, I'm speechless. As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart. You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. But I… I still want one. Back where I come from, there are men who do nothing all day but good deeds. They are called philo… philo… good-deed-doers. And their hearts are no bigger than yours. But they have one thing you haven't got, a testimonial. Therefore, in consideration of your kindness I take pleasure at this time in presenting you with a small token of our esteem and affection. And remember, my sentimental friend, that a heart is not judged by how much you love but by how much you are loved by others. It ticks! Listen! Look, it ticks! Read what my medal says… "Courage." Ain't it the truth! Ain't it the truth! They're all wonderful. Hey, what about Dorothy? - Yes, how about Dorothy? - Yeah, Dorothy next. - Yeah, Dorothy… I don't think there's anything in that black bag for me. Well, you force me into a cataclysmic decision. The only way to get Dorothy to Kansas is for me to take her there myself. Will you? Could you? But are you a clever enough wizard to manage it? Child, you cut me to the quick! I'm an old Kansas man myself, born and bred in the heart of the western wilderness, premier balloonist par excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company. Until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair. - It did? - Weren't you frightened? Frightened? You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death, sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe. I was petrified. Then, suddenly the wind changed and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard Deluxe! Times being what they were, I accepted the job retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick getaway. And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum. My friends. I mean, my friends! This is positively the finest exhibition ever to be shown, be that as it may. I, your Wizard per ardua ad alta, am about to embark upon a hazardous and technically unexplainable journey into the outer stratosphere! To confer, converse and otherwise hobnob with my brother wizards. And I hereby decree that until what time, if any, that I return, the Scarecrow, by virtue of his highly superior brains shall rule in my stead, assisted by the Tin Man, by virtue of his magnificent heart and the Lion, by virtue of his courage. Obey them as you would me. Thank you. Toto! Come back! Toto! Don't go without me. I'll be right back. Stop that dog! This is a highly irregular procedure. This is absolutely unprecedented! - Ruined my exit! - Come back! Come back! Don't go without me! Please come back! I can't come back! I don't know how it works! Goodbye, folks! Goodbye! Now I'll never get home. Stay with us then, Dorothy. We all love you. We don't want you to go. That's very kind of you but this could never be like Kansas. Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now. Scarecrow, what am I gonna do? Look! Here's someone who can help you! - Will you help me? Can you help me? - You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas. - I have? - Then why didn't you tell her before? Because she wouldn't have believed me. She had to learn it for herself. What have you learned, Dorothy? Well, I think that it… that it wasn't enough just to want to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em. And it's that, if I ever go looking for my heart's desire again, I won't look any further than my own back yard because if it isn't there I never really lost it to begin with. Is that right? That's all it is. But that's so easy! I should've thought of it for you. - I should've felt it in my heart. - No, she had to find it out for herself. Now those magic slippers will take you home in 2 seconds. - Toto too? - Toto too. - Now? - Whenever you wish. Dear, that's too wonderful to be true! It's… it's gonna be so hard to say goodbye. I love you all too. Goodbye, Tin Man. Don't cry. You'll rust so dreadfully. Here, here's your oilcan. - Goodbye. - Now I know I’ve got a heart because it's breaking. Goodbye, Lion. You know, I know it isn't right but I’m gonna miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage. I would never have found it if it hadn't been for you. I think I'll miss you most of all. - Are you ready now? - Yes. Say goodbye, Toto. - Yes, I'm ready now. - Then close your eyes and tap your heels together 3 times and think to yourself: “There's no place like home.” “There's no place like home.” There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home. - Wake up, honey. - There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no… Dorothy. Dorothy dear, it’s Aunt Em, darling. Auntie Em, it's you! - Yes, darling. - Hello there! Anybody home? I just dropped by because I heard the little girl got caught in the big… - Well, she seems all right now. - She got quite a bump on the head. We kinds thought there for a minute, she was gonna leave us. But I did leave you, Uncle Henry, that's just the trouble. And I tried to get back for days and days! There, there, lie quiet now. - You just had a bad dream. - Sure. Remember me, your old pal, Hunk? And me, Hickory? You couldn't forget my face, could ya? No, but it wasn't a dream, it was a place. And you and you and you and you were there. But you couldn't have been, could you? We dream lots of silly things when we… No, Aunt Em, this was a real, truly live place. And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice but most of it was beautiful. But just the same, all I kept saying to everybody was, "I want to go home!" And they sent me home. Doesn't anybody believe me? Of course we believe you, Dorothy. But anyway, Toto, we're home! Home! And this is my room and you're all here. And I’m not going to leave here ever, ever again because I love you all. And… Auntie Em, there's no place like home!
