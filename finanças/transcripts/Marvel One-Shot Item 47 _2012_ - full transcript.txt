C'mon Claire, we-- - We don't know what we're doing here. - I do. - No, you don't! - Yes, I do! I really do, okay? That thing fell out of the sky into our laps. I mean, to me that's a sign, okay? What makes you so sure that the sign is pointing in the right direction? You make me sure. 'Cause you got it to work. Always said that we deserve better, right? I-- I don't wanna wait for somebody to give us a chance. It's time that we took a chance for ourselves. I hope you're right. I am. I'm always right. I'm always right about you. - Okay. - Okay. Okay!

I have been there. They do a great pulled pork right down the street. I don't think you're taking this assignment very seriously. That's funny, I was just thinking the same thing about you. While you've been in here gathering video clips I've been out investigating. It turns out a used 28 foot Pearson was taken off the market in Key West. Spoke to the former owner. A couple matching our description paid in cash. Boat gets out of dry dock in 24 hours so, I'd like to get a move on. I understand, Agent Coulson. I'm sorry, force of habit. We all miss him.

Just-- I'll-- Just-- Stay right there. Don't move. I'll be right back. Hello? Please stop squirming. Claire, it's the cops! Hit the deck, baby! Hey, my wrist... - Benny!

He would love to show you. - Just anything, but we can't... We can't go to jail. - Look at him, he can't go to jail - Who said anything about jail?
