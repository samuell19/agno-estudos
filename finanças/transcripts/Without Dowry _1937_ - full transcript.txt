She keeps an open house, receives everyone. Prospective bridegrooms are even paying her, little mother. If you like her daughter, open up your purse. She's taking some bridegrooms "for a dowry", but as to her giving a dowry - don't ask for it. Smart woman. Vozhevatov is going to be a good merchant. Yes. He's young, but never takes unnecessary risks... never pays overcharged prices. Who is this Karandyshev? - Living by his wages only. - But pretends to "rank and fashion" Hey look, he never talks. How do you suppose him to talk, he's a millionaire! Kharita Ignatievna is a quick woman. Yes. She married off her second daughter. They're dowerless, but they found a good bridegroom. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen. I know a new song... What is it? Vassya, what is it? "Verevyushki-verevyu" (song title, no meaning) - Paratov is here! - you don't say! Pardon. Merci. What a falcon! A splendid barin. A squanderer. A corrupt man! - The bride's carriage! - Go on! and we'll proclaim His glory. We'll proclaim, we'll proclaim His glory. and we'll proclaim, and we'll proclaim His glory, His glory. and we'll proclaim, and we'll proclaim His glory, His glory, His glory, His glory. Larissa! Come on, Larissa! Stop, you, stop! At your service. Merci. Paratov lives in style. I'm not sure about other things, but style he's got enough. Get going! Hey you Volga, you Volga-mother. You're so wide, Volga... overflowing so wide, Volga. Over the grass, over the young grass, "Swallow" and over the quick-sands... S.S.Paratov's. Storehouse N.7 ...and over stones. So what, Sergey Sergeyevich... are you selling your "Swallow"? No, Vassily Danilovich, never. My "Swallow" is faster than the "Airplane". This is not a proper business for a barin. But it suits me fine. I have much cargo to take downriver. Gentlemen, let's have a cool drink. Moky Parmyonovich? Yes, gentlemen, to the health of Larissa Dmitrievna, today is her birthday. I am sad because I love you, and I know the rumour's guileful persecution won't spare your blooming youth. You silly woman! This is all I hear from you! I save your every kopeck, madame! So, where are those 8 kopecks? What are you talking about? These are the prices in the market. Don't you teach me about the market! I know the prices very well! I am sad because you're joyful. Look here. Vassya sent you a present. Not bad... He's so nice. "Not bad"... that's quite something! It's worth about 500 roubles. Thank Vassya for the present. Whisper in his ear... "I thank you" you will have to pay for your destiny. Thank Knurov... also. Knurov? What for? Just do it! I know... what for. - Will we see each other tonight at the Ogoudalovs? - Yes, yes. And you, Moky Parmyonovich? I don't like the place. They receive all sorts of rabble. Let's go, it will be fun. The girl is attractive. They make you feel free there. Moky Parmyonovich, I want to give Larissa... a present. But it costs a lot. Too much for me. It's not a problem! Happy birthday! I'll never find the words to thank you enough, Moky Parmyonovich. Corrupting her... a little? Why do I care for her morals? Excuse us, gentlemen. You will dance now. Mother, no. Come here. You will dance now. Why? Just do it. Gentlemen, Larissa want to dance for us. This girl should have every luxury. A precious stone should have only the best setting. Yes. And a good jeweler. Telegram for you. Ask Ogoudalova. There... I want to tell you... What? I want to tell you... I... I... I love you - I don't believe you. - You don't believe? Here! well, well, well... seed by seed... seed by seed... What if somebody will see us? Let them see! No, pope, you've had enough. Madame! Madame! A telegram. Sergey Sergeyevich! Sergey Sergeyevich! Where is he? I don't see Larissa Dmitrievna either. Forever? Forever! Sergey Sergeyevich! Hallo-o-o! 5-May-1878. The Agricultural Bank has declined your loan. Your estate is put up for auction. Petrov, notary. Forever! Forever... "Swallow" He's gone... He's gone. He's gone! He's gone! Sadness is tormenting me like a crawling snake. Burn, my little pinewood chip, burn down. I will burn down with you. Larissa!! What have you done! You've disgraced us before the whole town. Let's go home. Let's go home! Let's go. A year later. Not a single letter. Larissa has not at all, what you'd call a practical, everyday, earthy quality. No. Not at all. She's ethereal! Ethereal, Moky Parmyonovich. She was born to shine. Yes, Moky Parmyonovich, to shine. So you think you're doing a good thing by marrying a daughter to a poor man? I don't know. She wanted it. Miss, miss! Your fianc? has arrived! I was just admiring the Volga. How nice it's there, on the other side. Let's go to the country, quickly. Why such a hurry? Why? I want to flee from here. Fleeing from whom? Who's turning you out? Or are you ashamed of me? Well, I hope she'll leave him soon and come back to live here. And then, on what means shall my daughter and I live? This can be helped. A sympathetic assistance from a strong, rich man... If we could find such an assistance... You must do your best to find it. When will we go then? After the wedding - any day. But the wedding is going take place here! I don't want people to say that we're hiding, because I'm no match for you, but just a piece of straw that a drowning persons clings to. But that is true. You can keep this truth to yourself. Have pity... Please, have pity on me. At least a little. At least try to pretend in front of others that you... love... ... me. You should get a good, a very good set of clothes for Larissa Dmitrievna to wear. Yes, yes, Moky Parmyonovich. I want you to order everything from the best shop, whatever the cost. Mother! I'm afraid. I'm afraid of something. You're going to shine as has never seen here before. No, no... No. Since we're holding the wedding here, let it be as quiet as possible. No, get that silly idea of your mind! A wedding is a wedding! I'm Ogoudalova! I won't have any display of poverty. I give up. I'm just a plaything for you. You'll play with me, break me, and then throw me away. Larissa Dmitrievna, what if Paratov would show up? Ah, if Sergey Sergeyevich would show up... Don't worry, he will not show up. And even if he would, it's too late. Probably we will never meet again. "Swallow" Even if I'll die irretrievably, for ever and ever, my friends. Nevertheless, in the meantime, punctually, I will drink, drink... Catch up with the merchant! "Saint Olga" Stoke! Stoke, I told you! Full ahead! Stoke! If you add one more log, I'll jump overboard. Coward! Foreigner! ... Dutchman! You have arithmetic instead of a soul. "Saint Olga" Put them ashore! Hooligans... Invitation card. Efrosinia Potapovna Karandysheva invites you to dinner on May 19th. given for the engagement of her nephew Yuli Kapitonovich Karandyshev with Larissa Dmitrievna Ogoudalova. Give us the best wine! ...a foreign vintage! Enough! We live on wages only! Dinner is dinner! - Really? - Really! Even if it would cost me the double, or triple, I'm not stingy with money. - You want some glorification for yourself? - Yes, glorification. Take this wine, 60 kopeck a bottle, and I will attach any label you want, even a foreign one. Saddlery traders E. E. Sharpov This dinner will cost me lots of efforts and troubles... Those cooks are all rogues, behaving like a winner in the kitchen, you don't dare say a word to them... Auntie, why talk with them at all? If it had been our victuals from the village, I wouldn't say a word. But this is bought, so expensive. It's such a waste! Help!!! Save us!!! Help!!! Who are you? An artist, Arkady Shchastlivtsev. ["lucky man"] A merchant's son, Neputyoivy. ["good-for-nothing"] You, Robinson, get in. What about me? The merchant should take some fresh air here. "New Paris" dressmaker. Moky Parmyonovich Knurov. Wedding dress. 180 roubles. - What's going on? - The barin has come. - Which barin? - We've been waiting for him for a year! When he sets foot on the land, I'll wave like this, you fire the gun. ... trembling like an autumn leaf. Sadness is tormenting me like a crawling snake. Burn, my little pinewood chip, burn down. I will burn down with you. Burn, my ... Let me introduce... Robinson. don't be fresh! "La Serge"... He is a provincial actor, gentlemen. Vozhevatov's navigation. Former Paratov's. Don't you feel sorry, Sergey Sergeyevich? For me, there's nothing that is sacred. If I see it's to my advantage, then I'll sell anything. I'm selling my free life, gentlemen. - Getting married to a very rich girl! - Yes. I'll be getting a gold mine as dowry. That's a wonderful dowry. HOTEL I invite you gentlemen for dinner at my place today. I'm sorry, Sergey Sergeyevich. We've been invited elsewhere. Make some excuses. Larissa Dmitrievna is going to get married. We're having dinner at her fianc?'s. Larissa is going to get married? Well... so much the better. Sergey Sergeyevich, ah, my dear! You wish to fold me into your arms? You may. My first visit is to you, aunty. I would like to pay my respects to Larissa Dmitrievna. You didn't expect me? No. Not now. I gave up expecting you. Let me ask you something. Did you wait a long time? Do you really care? What interests me is... how long can a woman ardently love someone before she forgets him? Do you imagine that after you I fell in love with somebody else? You're getting married! I am forced to do it. How can I live here, while in terrible, unbearable anguish, I am forced to smile, pay compliments. They're imposing fianc?s on me. I need to run away from home, and even from town. Larissa! Larissa, didn't you forget me? Do you still... ... love me? Let me introduce you, gentlemen. Yuli Kapitonovich Karandyshev Sergey Sergeyevich Paratov I am honored by your company an old friend of Larissa Dmitrievna and Kharita Ignatievna. pleased to meet you. Sergey Sergeyevich is like a member of the family. - Auntie... - pleased to meet you. What have you been talking about with Paratov? What could you have been talking about? Whatever we have been talking about, it's none of your business. I want to give this present... for Larissa's wedding. But I don't have enough money. Auntie, I remember your tactics. I bet you've robbed three men already... Ah, mischief! What could you have been talking about? Why are you so interested? It's time you gave up your old habits. You're not jealous? I trust that Larissa Dmitrievna won't give any cause for it. But else... What else, Mr. Karandyshev? Nothing else. I've nothing to add. No, that's not all. You missed the main thing. You owe me an apology. Me? Apologize to you? Gentlemen, Gentlemen! Enough! Enough now... Please! Do it for me! Forgive him! You should thank Kharita Ignatievna. I forgive you. I ask you to be friends. Miss, for a moment... Come here. Come here. Now you'd better invite Sergey Sergeyevich to dinner. I... I was just going to do it. Sergey Sergeyevich... Would you like to have dinner at my place today? With pleasure. Larissa, didn't you forget me? Do you still love me? Love me... I want to go to the country, right this minute. come come, we couldn't go now, really we couldn't Why aren't you listening to me? You are going to destroy me. Gentlemen... Gentlemen, some Burgundy? Bring it. No, thank you. We're drinking champagne. Gentlemen, I haven't eaten a thing. Moky Parmyonovich? Gentlemen... Gentlemen, I'm a very happy man! ...today! I'm triumphant! Stop, stop him! How? He's not a child. Drink, Robinson! You're used to foreign wines. ... made in Yaroslavl. Well, Serge, you will answer me for this before God. Sergey Sergeyevich! Stop making fun of Yuli Kapitonovich. Larissa Dmitrievna... - You're hurting me. - I could never do that. All right. If you want, I'll put an end to all this. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes... Yes, yes, yes... toys. Be careful! It's loaded. Yuli Kapitonovich! Do you want to drink to brotherhood (Br?derschaft) with me? With pleasure! Please, some lemons. What lemons, you snake? Use some cranberry juice. People are godless nowadays. 1... 2... 3... 4... very likely something will be missing 6... 7... 8... 8? 9... 9. I'm so ashamed. They make him drunk on purpose. Now you're friends forever. Why are they doing it? They're having a bit of fun I guess. But they make me suffer! No one wants you to suffer. I'll ask Larissa Dmitrievna... ...to sing for us. When I'm drunk... though I'm always drunk, then I'm recalling you. And having recalled you, I'm cursing that marvelous but distant hour. That marvelous but dista... Larissa Dmitrievna, I haven't heard you sing for a year. And maybe I'll never hear you again. Would you sing a song for us? May I also join in this request? Please, please, Larissa Dmitrievna. Please, please.. No, gentlemen, no! Larissa Dmitrievna is not going to sing. How do you know she won't? We will ask her thoroughly. No, gentlemen, it's no use asking. I forbid it! I positively forbid her ... You forbid it? - I'm going to sing, gentlemen! - Bravo, bravo! - If Larissa Dmitrievna were cross with us to the other side of the Volga - yes... Is it possible at all? Nothing on earth is impossible, gentlemen. He was telling me: be mine and I'll live burning with passion. A tender look, a lovely smile, are promising me heavenly pleasures. to the poor heart he was telling this to the poor heart he was telling this but he wasn't in love, no, he wasn't in love he wasn't in love, he wasn't in love with me he was telling me: like a bright star you light up the obscure soul you raised hopes in my heart filling my dreams with a sweet fantasy now he was smiling, now shedding tears now he was smiling, now shedding tears but he wasn't in love, no, he wasn't in love he wasn't in love, he wasn't in love with me He made promises of dreams and happiness, of ecstasy of passion to my delicate heart. He gave his word most tenderly to sweeten my life with everlasting bliss, everlasting love. he ruined my heart with sweet talks he ruined my heart with sweet talks but he wasn't in love, no, he wasn't in love he wasn't in love, he wasn't in love with me It's a great pleasure to see you, it's an even greater pleasure to hear you sing. Larissa Dmitrievna, oh God, oh my dear. A great pleasure to see you, even greater p... It seems to me... I'm going crazy. I was cursing myself while you sang. But why? Why did I leave you? And what did I gain by it? - Then why did you do it? - Wait... Wait, don't blame me yet. I would give up everything, and no power on earth... ...could separate us. Lari... I'm leaving tomorrow. Tomorrow? All of our party will be going sailing on the Volga now. Will you come with us? - When are we going? - Now... ... or never! Let's go then. Sergey Sergeyevich... Sergey Sergeyevich, quick! Gentlemen! Gentlemen, I propose a toast to Larissa Dmitrievna! Gentlemen... the main, and not sufficiently valued talent of Larissa Dmitrievna is that, gentlemen... is that, gentlemen... is that she knows how to appreciate and choose people of quality. Yes, Larissa Dmitrievna knows, all is not gold that glitters. She was looking for a man not brilliant, but dignified. - And she chooses... - You? - Yes. - Bravo! Bravo! Excuse me... Excuse me gentlemen, maybe not all are pleased to hear it, but I consider it as my duty to publicly thank Larissa Dmitrievna... Gentlemen... I'm drinking... and I'm asking all of you to drink to health of my fianc?e. Bravo! Bravo! Do you have any wine left? To be sure I do! Champagne!! Let's go. Where are you going? Goodbye, mama. For God's sake, why? Where are you going? Either you'll rejoice with me, or look for me in the Volga. Gentlemen, I... Gentlemen, I... They left? What a surprise. Well, it's to the better. And as we are now among a close family circle... Where is Larissa Dmitrievna? Kharita Ignatievna, where is your daughter? Answer me, where's your daughter? I brought her to your house, Yuli Kapitonovich. It's up to you to tell me where my daughter is. - By evening all must be ready! - Yes sir. - We'll return to finish drinking! - Yes sir. Across the Volga? How's that? Because they're having a sort of picnic. Cruel. So terribly cruel. It's ridiculous. I'm a ridiculous man. But can you condemn anyone for being ridiculous? So I'm that way. Laugh at me. Laugh in my face! But to tear out a man's heart from his chest, throw it underfoot, and crush it... How will I live? How will I live? How will I live? Ah... I wasn't aware of anything. No, Kharita Ignatievna, You're all from the same gang. You're all alike. But let me tell you, if I have to choose between hanging myself in shame, or revenge... Then I choose revenge, that's for sure! I will have my revenge on everyone of them. Everyone! Where are your friends, Mr. Robinson? Which friends? Ah, those... I have no friends. You know, I'm a... family man. Don't you know, where are they now? They carouse somewhere. It would be great to make a trip to Paris with her. So that's what you had in mind, Moky Parmyonovich. It would cost no less than the "swallow". Every article has its own price, Moky Parmyonovich. You must positively know where they are! I'm a family man... you know. Ivan! What do you wish? Take this away. How come that you're not at the picnic with them? I fell asleep, and they didn't dare to bother me. yes, yes, yes... No, no, no. I won't give it away, let's play. No way. We have long odds. Well, take it. CITY GARDEN Let me thank you... ...for the pleasure... No, this is not enough... for the happiness that you have brought to us. - What? - Larissa Dmitrievna, you must go home now. I'm not going back home. But it's impossible for you to stay here. Think about the rumors, you'll be the source of it. No, Sergey Sergeyevich, stop your fancy talk. Give me a straight answer: am I now your wife or am I not? The drama unfolds. We're not to blame. We've had nothing to do with it. I've seen tears in Larissa's eyes. I'm sorry, Larissa Dmitrievna, don't take offense, but I don't think you have the right... - the right? - ... to ask that. Have you forgotten? I suffered for a year. I could not forget you. You appeared. You said: "Give up everything and I'm yours." Isn't this my right? This is all very well, but let's talk about it tomorrow. No, today. We'll talk now. Do you insist? Yes, l do. Very well. So now, we are not only allowed, we feel forced to take part in her destiny. So... Do you mean... that now it's the right occasion? Yes, probably. Why not? Well, what's stopping you?... Who? You're stopping me, and I'm stopping you. Moky Parmyonovich, you can't bribe me. Maybe this? This is the best way. Heads or tails? Throw it! - You win! - Yes. However, I didn't lose. It won't cost me anything. But soon the heat of passion will wear off, he'll open his eyes and see the horrible truth, realizing he can't break the chains. Are you married? I'm engaged. Ah! It's godless... It's godless... Go away... I can take care of myself. Vassily Danilovich! You've given your word. You're offending me, Moky Parmyonovich. You're a merchant. You should know what giving one's word means. I know what a merchant's word is! After all, I'm dealing with YOU... Vassya! Vassya, I'm lost! Vassya, what shall I do? Help me! Teach me! Larissa Dmitrievna, I'd be glad to help, but I don't see what can be done. Just pity me then, that's all I ask. If nothing else, just weep with me. I can't. I really can't. Are you chained down as well? I'm in shackles, Larissa Dmitrievna. What kind? I gave my merchant's word. There'll be nothing to be ashamed of. No one will blame you for anything. I can offer you my unlimited support, so unlimited... that the most spiteful gossips and moralizers would be forced to shut up. You're upset. I'm not rushing you for an answer. Think it over. What you did deserves punishment. But I'm the only one who has the right to judge you. I will decide whether or not to forgive you. You can't imagine how you disgust me! Why are you here? Knurov and Vozhevatov are flipping coins which one is to get you. Heads or tails! They don't think of you as a human being. They think of you as an object! object... object... object... object... I am an object! Yes, an object. They are right. Finally a word has been found for what I am! Larissa Dmitrievna... Go away! Leave me alone. Every object should have an owner. I'm your owner! Oh, no. As long as I'm an object... I'm going with Knurov. Tell him so. What are you doing? Come to your senses... Then I will go myself. Larissa Dmitrievna! Stop! Stop! I forgive you! You forgive me? I forgive you everything! Let's leave this town, right now. Too late! I love you! I love you! You're lying! I looked for love and it wasn't there! I beg you! Go away! You should belong to me! Never! Then you'll belong to no one! What have I done! What? What? I thank you... I myself (did it) ... The End subtitles IDBoris & serdar202
