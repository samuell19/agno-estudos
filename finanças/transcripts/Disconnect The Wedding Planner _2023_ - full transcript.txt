[upbeat music playing] [man] Thank you so much. Thank you. No. I will. [man] Aw, this looks amazing. - [man] Dee! Hello. - Hello. [man chuckles] Mwah! - [man] Please sit. - [Dee] Thank you. - [Dee] Okay. - You look amazing by the way. [Dee] Thank you. Hello. Hey, so would you like to order something to eat? - No. I'm fine, thank you. - You sure? [Dee] Mm-hmm. 'Cause you know it's gonna be weird watching me watching you eat... watching... - Yeah? You sure? - I know. Okay. [comically] Mmm. Mm-hmm. [mumbles] It's delicious. Mmm. - Um, Otis... - Hmm? - What are we? - Huh? Are we a thing or just a fling? [waitress] Excuse me, madam. - Here is the menu. - [Dee] Thank you. Dee, see I thought we were keeping things casual. When you help me, I help you. We help each other. Did you change your mind? I need something more than just the physical, you know. [chuckles] Slow down, eh. [mutters under breath] It's so hard to put this in words. I... I think that, - maybe we... - Okay, okay. Dee? Um... So... Ugh! There isn't an us. Yeah? And if you hoped that maybe things will change down the road, well, you hoped wrong. This isn't happening. I do not do relationships. Okay? I mean, come on, look around you. Look. [Otis] Uhn? [softly] Okay. Dee. Dee. Sit. - I booked a room. - [sternly] Fuck you. [whispers] Dee. Dee. [rooster crows] [upbeat music plays] [playfully] Hey, Patricia. No, I'm just having cake. By myself. [chuckles] Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, I am at uh, Urban Eatery. Yeah. Come through, come over. Come over. [upbeat music continues] [indistinct background chatter] [Otis] Dele! Okay, let's talk about some of the concerns that you might have. [Dele] I can tell you that right now is not a good time to talk, Otis. [Otis] No. Dele, listen I know it's only been a year since your mom's funeral, but if your mom and my mom were still alive, they'd be so happy to see us doing business together. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to respectfully decline. Dele, please tell me, what does it take to have your secret change of funding? Just get it done! Ah! Um, hold on a second, Otis. Let me come back to you. Hey babe, what's wrong? Ah, like I'm so tired. Babe, I'm stressed out. I'm, I'm tired. - Ah, I don't know. - [spluttering] What can I do to help? Dele. Babe, I don't know. Maybe I should take a month off and and sort things out. Nonsense! Not when you're working on the biggest case of your career. What do you want me to do? [Dele] What's up with the wedding planner? [woman] But I told you... Oh babe, you don't even listen when I talk to you. I told you this, I don't trust this wedding planner. The one I originally wanted is booked till end of year. [Dele] You know what? Just don't worry about this. - [Dele] Okay? - I shouldn't worry about it? [woman] Babe, we have a very important wedding. You are telling me not to worry about it? [Otis] Okay. Uh, hey Rita! What do you think, about a dream destination wedding in Mombasa? Otis? He's been listening the whole time? [Otis] Uh, hey listen. Uh, it'll... [hesitating] it would be... it's a fabulous idea for both of you. Um... Hi, Otis. A traditional destination wedding? Yeah, let me handle it. [scoffs] Um Otis, are you even qualified? What do you know about planning weddings? [splutters] What?! I have a degree. I did a Major in Wedding Planning. I got you. Oh okay, Otis. Um, say we let you handle it, right? Isn't it too late to find something nice? Rita, stop this foolishness. Babe! [whispers] Please listen to him. What can we do about the venue? Ah. So... I have a friend, okay? [Otis] She is from Tanzania. She is called Nandi. Wonderful lady, and she owns a resort. Can I give her a call first thing tomorrow morning? It has to be a Yoruba wedding. [Otis] Of course, yes. Yes. [man] Dude, she's a minute away. [Otis hesitates] Dele, thank you, okay? I love you, bro. Mwah! Oh yo! That was Dele. He's on board. [Otis sighs in relief] We just have to do some tiny little bitty thing for him. [Otis chuckles, whoops] [man] Love to see you closing deals. Josh would be proud. [Dele] Ah, come on, man. It's been three years. Three years since Josh ditched us and fucked off to Amsterdam with Belinda. You know, my mom... My mom left us with the company. That's how lucky we are. Nick, into banking. Let It go. Okay? Let's have some fun. [Otis laughs wildly] Let's party! [soft R&B music playing] [woman] Hello? [woman] Anybody home? Judy?

Have you though? You should actually take some credit too, Celine. You know, for helping plan all of this. Yes! My man, Dele. - Hey. [giggles] - Hey. [chuckling] Is everything okay? [TK] Mm-hmm. Do you have a minute? Yeah. Um... What's up? I just wanted to take you out for a thank-you drink. I mean this party is... It means a lot. Uh yeah, when, when were you thinking? Next week.

Oh. Hi, Otis. te. Belinda. [Otis] Hey. Valerie. Grace. - [Otis] Uh... - [TK] I'm just gonna... No. Uh T, TK... [soft music plays] [soft music continues] [people cheering and laughing] Three million. That's my final offer. [woman] How about we do this? We sell for 3.5 million... [Otis] Mm-hmm. ...you pay two million now, that covers the first half pay for my services and the vendors. If everything is good to your liking, you pay the remaining 1.5. That covers the rest of my pay, the professional video and the wedding album. How does that sound? Sounds good. Draw up the contract by tomorrow and I can send the first pay. Sounds good to me. [gentle music playing] Perhaps, we can discuss the wedding details over lunch. [TK] In all fairness, setbacks in any projects are inevitable. Thankfully here at Pinnacle Development, we have contingencies in place. And because of that, I can assure you, the estimated completion date for the Capilano Plaza, is May 2025. Thank you. Okay. Ladies and gents, any questions? Miss Maina, in a culture where it takes months to break ground, what makes Pinnacle Management different? In the last ten years, out of 40 Kenyan projects, fifteen were completed on time. A third of all those 15 were Pinnacle. And that is why you're here, right? Fair enough. But how do I respond to my partners at Fairmont Capital, when they hear it's some woman who will be running the show? That is a very brave question to ask me. Well, since I started working with Pinnacle, our overrun costs moved from 8.5 to 3.95. That is half of the industry's average. I need something more convincing than your credentials. Try a personal touch. How about effective communication? Choosing the right team, exceptional risk management. Is something funny? TK, um uh... we already closed on Fairmont last week. They absolutely loved you. So, everyone here knows that except you. So I am the last to know. [TK giggles] So you're not a sexist. - [men laugh] - [TK sighs, laughs] She's feisty. I'm not so sure you want to tell her the other news. What other news? Now Selena, please tell me how are things between you and Richie? Her name is Celine. My name is Richard. - Richard. Celine. - Oh, I'm sorry. I struggle with names. It's okay. Please continue, Selena. [sighs] Celine. Please stop correcting her, Richard. Look, she should be able to get our names right. But she just said she struggles with names. It's the least she can do considering how much we're paying her, babe. [Celine] You see? His narrow mindedness is what I have to deal with everyday. And now it's gotten to a point where he has a complete disregard for my personal time and my space and something has to change if... [frog croaking sound] Oh sorry, I forgot to put my phone on silent. - [therapist chuckles] - [comic music plays] I have to pick this. Jeremy. [therapist] What is it? Yes, I froze your credit card. Do you want to take back your words? Okay, please do so before I consider becoming a widow. [therapist giggles eerily] Spouses! Please continue, Selena. Celine! Celine. "Ne," "ne". Oh, sorry. Now you see how I feel. [sighs deeply] Actually, I don't. Look, Richard. I love you. And I know that you mean well and I am really trying to make this work. It's just that sometimes I feel so... just so suffocated when I'm around you. Babe, last year when you said I should put in more effort in the relationship. I put my best foot forward. I actually... [frog croaking sound] Jeremy. I am at work trying to get an income, which some of it is going to offset the stupid... Yes, the stupid debts you put us into. Please don't call me again. If you do, I'm going to circumcise you a second time. [chuckles eerily] Oh now, I have an assignment for you two. And it's going to be very helpful especially for you, Richie. [upbeat club music playing] Dad, you owe me 80,000 bob. Eighty thousand, why? Okay, forty thousand. Now you're changing. What's your basis? Your socks don't match your trousers, that's why. My socks don't match the uh... You are not even wearing socks. Okay. Ten minutes TV, and then you go to bed. - Promise? - Promise. - Ten? - Minutes. High five. Love you. So business is looking good. We have a new investor. And... That's good. I'm proud of you. How are things with your dad? [scoffs] What do you think? - Priti... - Stop. I'm good. You, you are you. And we're here. I risked everything for a love that did not exist. Let's just raise her. Okay? What are you watching? Can I watch with you? [Otis chuckles] [in Swahili] I'm amazed! It fits perfectly. [in Swahili] Nandi, how are you? Hi, dude. I've been trying to get a hold of you for the last two weeks, and it's not happening. [in Swahili] What's happening? And this Liz lady of yours, [in Swahili] that you were telling me about is yet to get in touch with me. Can I please know what's going on? Is this wedding happening or not? Let me know. [in Swahili] Um, let me call her. [tense music plays] [automated voice] Sorry, the mobile subscriber cannot be reached. Just a minute. [in Swahili] Pick up, pick up. The mobile subscriber you're calling is unavailable. I'll be back. This was a good second meeting. I just wish Erastus was here. He has an urgent project to complete, but he sends his apologies. It's important to have one sitting for the two. Absolutely. He's just been so busy with work at my dad's company. Trying to prove himself. But you know, he's not getting married to your father, or that business of his. It is you he gets to share the rest of his life. That's something to consider. Share my warmest regards to everyone. Most certainly, Pastor Eric. - Take care, eh? - You too.

Aw, who did I do? Who, not what?! Who?! [lively music plays] Hey! What are we celebrating? [Celine] Well, what's going on here? Find a new man? You, are looking at Pinnacle's Management new Vice President of Projects. Bitch, I'm a boss. - You got promoted? - I got promoted! - Oh my goodness. Congratulations! - I know. Thank you. And you are baking too. Who have you become?! TK. TK. I hope you didn't have too many. - Oh. - Huh? Hmm? [both giggle] Bitch, I'm a boss. Fuck. Judy! Judy! Shit. - Judy! - Judy! - [TK] Judy! [laughs] - Judy! Yoh, she didn't... hey! - Deputy Jesus. - Judy. [soft instrumental music playing] [TK] You know, now that my career is on track, I thought I'd really be happy, you know. Living my best life... My love life is the shambles. At least you have some hope. I keep trying to express to Richard that I need some time to myself. Then every time that I do need some me time, he finds a way to penetrate himself in there. Like, if I knew that moving into his area would be this bad, I would have just stayed where I was. Cause like at this point, my biggest fear is that if I move in with him, [whispers] I'll strangle him in his sleep. And the only word that I heard, is penetrate. [Celine] Hmm. Look who's up. Hey, welcome back. [TK] What do you think of the unethical monogamy? [Celine] Polyamory? [TK] There's a difference. I mean one, you are open to it, and you know who the others are. Polyamorous is... It's like fornication, eh. But I think we're just tied up at so many expectations because truly, can one person, truly give you all you need and want? If you put it that way... I think we should just accept the new way of life. And who knows? It could bring an end to cheating, heartache... [all laugh sardonically] - You know... - He is fucking my dad's secretary. I actually liked her. That little bitch. [wistful music playing] [TK] Fuck. - [Judy sobs] - [Celine] Can I help? - [TK] Sis... - It's okay. [mobile phone vibrates] Otieno, it's six. What the fuck? Dele arrives in less than a week and is expecting a lavish wedding at the coast that I promised. Huh? I'm not panicking. Do I look like I'm panicking? I'm not panicking. What? Help me. Okay guys, I'm sorry. I know this is off topic, but why do all of you look like shit? [Robin] Well, apart from you, Richie. Hi, Richie. Hi, uh... It's Richard, but I see motherhood looks good on you. Oh, thanks Richard. I love it. Oh. Okay guys, can we please get back to my falling apart life? Chill the fuck out, Otis. [child's voice] Mom, you said a bad word. No. I didn't say... I said yuck. Like, yuck the chill out. Jesus of Nazareth, guys! Dele and Rita are flying on Friday, okay? And that's why I'm turning to every one of you to please, please help me out. I know, I know I messed up. Okay? But at least the hotel is booked. My girl, Nandi, she's got me. Oh, one of your little whores. No, TK. She's not a whore. And I don't do whores. Judy um, why are you still wearing sunglasses? Oh, that's why it's so dark. Guys, please I need you! Please, I'm begging, help me! Okay? It's the coast. Well to be honest, it's very tempting, but um, I'll just pass. Robin, I know you despise me. No, it's not about that. I mean um, I have children to look after. - Yeah, motherhood. You know these things... - [plates crashes on floor] Hey, Cyril! Stop, drop that. Put it down. Okay guys, I gotta go. Good luck! Okay. Cyril. I'm out. It's your mess, Otis It was a bad idea to begin with. Khalid, it affects you just as much as it affects me. If we don't handle this, we won't make it past the fourth quarter. You're pathetic. I'll book a ticket. Guys, I'm on vacation. I don't intend to spend it doing damage control, okay? Good luck, Otis. TK. No, thanks. And besides you have Nandi. [in Swahili] What kind of name is that? [in Swahili] She is Tanzanian. What should I do about it? Also, I have a fear of flying. So can I please borrow your car? [upbeat music playing] I guess that's what a four-year relationship looks like. Boring and complacent. Is that why you swing from one cleavage to another? [in Swahili] Man, what's wrong with you? [Khalid] Just asking, jeez! Okay then, can we talk about something else? Yeah, like... Like what? Like... like how you got duped? [Richard protests] - [Celine] Richard... - [Richard] Hmm? when I was napping, why didn't you tell Otis to stop by the Man Eaters? Last I checked, we were giving each other some space. In this case, verbally, Celine. Well, it would have been nice to stop there seeing as it's a historical site. I wasn't aware. I hinted about it yesterday. Celine, do I look like I can read minds? Clearly not. [upbeat music continues] [Otis] Oh shit! You and your heavy foot. [in Swahili] Where are you going to? [in Swahili] We're headed this way... Why are you over speeding? Boss, we weren't speeding. The speed limit for the highway is 110km/hr. Here it's 80km/hr. Alight from the vehicle. [Otis sighs] The way I see you, you look like a very reasonable person. Why were you speeding? And you know the fines are usually very high. Then show us the speed gun. If we were speeding, we will pay the fine and I will go to court. You know, if we factor in the speed gun, It's a whole lot... eh, that's a big process. Because I'll have to go to the station. So much work, you know, a lot of paperwork. Officer, we have all the time in the world. You don't have to pull that card, eh? What is in your wallet? [hesitating] Er... It's not much but... Here. Bro, why are you giving me a condom? For you to be safe when you are taking bribes. - [both men laugh] - [upbeat music plays] Get out of here, you idiot! - Idiot! - [Otis] Officer! - [Otis] See you later. - Go away! That one is an idiot. [laughs] [Otis] ...an introduction. [Otis] You're welcome. - [Richard] Hi. - [Otis] Nandi! Nandi, Nandi. - [in Swahili] You've pissed me off, Otis. - What? I keep on calling you every time and you are not answering my calls. Come on give me a hug. - How are you? - I'm great. You look good. [in Swahili] Thank you. So, I have rooms booked for you and for your wedding guests. Everything else is sold out. Unless otherwise, if you want to pay for executive rooms. Okay. Uh, hi guys. This is Nandi. Nandi, these are the guys. Hi. Also, we will be sharing rooms. Ah, in that case, my girlfriend and I would like to get a suite. I heard you say something about executive. No. No, baby. Come on, why not? 'Cause it's not in our budget. I'll make a discount for you. - Yeah? - Yeah. Oh. The two of you make a cute couple together. Thank you. I'll take one of those too. For you it will have to be a full rate. What?! Just get the executive suite, right?

These are your assigned tasks based on your strengths. Do we have, uh, a list of local vendors we can tap into? Of course. Even wedding planners around here, we have. [in Swahili] Unluckily, the event planner we were to hire on the day of the wedding is not available because he has another wedding. [Otis] Okay. Uh, Rita's words, "Otis, we must get the Yoruba music right." So they're flying in their own DJ. [Khalid] Oh, excellent. [Otis] Uh... Excellent, yes. Okay! Uh yeah, one last thing. They fly in on Friday. [all] What?! - [Judy] Otis, what? - [Khalid] What?! What the fuck? Otis! Okay. [in Swahili] Talk to me. Show me the big white one again, Dad. Big white... [sighs] Priya, I've shown you like five times. Help me choose. Which one? They all look really yummy but you should pick that one. This one? [Otis] Are you sure? Uh, I wouldn't go for a fondant cake. Fondle. What is fondle cake? There's nothing to fondle. Fondant. Fondant. I'd suggest, uh, buttercream cake. I say fondant cake. Is TK there? She always knows what to do. Young lady, when did you become this smart? I love you. Mwah, mwah. Daddy loves you. So you were saying, uh, fondle cake? Fondant. - Fondant. - Yes. Gentlemen. I have three rules. Rule Number One, this is my kitchen. Rule Number Two, this is my kitchen. Once you register those rules into your thinking stations, then you'll register Rule Number Three. Do as I say. Are we clear? Silence! This is serious now. Serious. - [Khalid] What... [giggles] - [giggles] [chef] Get to work! - [Nandi] Hey, ladies. - [Judy] Hi. I just wanted to see if you girls are okay. I think we're good. Thank you. That top really looks nice on you. Where did you get it? It was a gift from Richard. Aw, that's so sweet of him. [Nandi] So, what is he like? He's brilliant. He's funny and insightful. He's decent. [Nandi in Swahili] He looks like it. I mean, he is not like the guys that I am used to meeting in my life. He has some affinity to him, you know? [Celine gives fake laugh] Maybe we should just, you know, continue here. Okay, um, if you need anything, just let me know. - [Celine] Mm-hmm. - Okay. You know, Khalid, my dad used to tell me, "Richard, as a man you must understand, that you can never understand women. There are only three things you can tell them. 'You are right, ' 'I love you, ' 'And I'm so sorry babe.'" What a bunch of BS. That man was so wrong. Hey, chill bro. You sound like you're digging for buried treasure. That's because he is when he shouldn't be. You see, the real understanding of a woman, comes from accepting the fact that she is human. And is allowed to make mistakes, changes, and decisions for herself. So what? So instead of you trying to figure her out in order to fix her, you need to allow her to feel accepted and supported. Once we show her that kind of support and love, it empowers her to become her true self. And give love at the same way. You know, those are very wise words, but they're coming from a man with very crude character. By pointing that finger at me, look how many fingers are pointing back at you. [Khalid chuckles] Babe. I think I just had a rude awakening. - Oh my God! - Baby... Maybe I've been looking through the wrong lens and it can be haunting. It can be haunting, you know. Can you just hold on to that thought? And it's so messed up the way I always want to be right about every single fucking thing, when really all I should care about is what's true. Baby, can you just give me three minutes of... And babe, babe, babe, I am so one-sided on a whole lot of topics And I think that it's time... [Celine yells] Richard! [agitatedly] I have to yell so that you can listen? God, it's so annoying. Now, I have to start over cause I'm not fucking calm.

Jeez. Jesus, you scared me. Oh, my bad. Am I that hideous? Gin and tonic, please. What do you have there? Soda. I am not a fan of alcohol. Actually, I think I'll have a moscato instead. Moscato? - Mosquito juice? - [chuckles] No, a moscato. It's a fizzy sweet drink, usually rosé or white wine. Celine thinks it's a boring drink. I mean, I'd offer you a sip, but I'm going to respect your decision. Oh, [laughs] I thought you said you weren't a fan. This is definitely not a boring drink. - [laughs] - Yeah? [laughs] - Oh. [laughs] - [Judy laughs] Okay. I think I'm going through a phase or something. [Richard] Oh. [laughs] Okay. [Judy giggles] [Richard] So you're taking the fourth, what? Your eyes... they are very intense. I'm going to the beach for a walk. You wanna come? [Judy] Such a beautiful evening. I really love beach walks. [Richard] They are even better if you have good company. You know, I thought I had good company. I was replaced. I found him in the arms of another woman. You didn't deserve that. No listen, you didn't deserve that, Judy. This world can be a cruel and nasty place sometimes, but the things people do to us, they are not a reflection of who we are. I need you to remember that.

TK, for your last-minute save, thank you so much. [in Swahili] My man, [in English] for your leadership. Cheers. Here. To teamwork, and solid friendships, and loyalty... [sardonically] Loyalty! Baby, it's okay. Just relax today. It's done. Cheers. [Otis] Okay. Let us eat. Judy just needs to break up with Erastus 'cause first of all, what kind of name is Erastus? He's always putting her down. The only thing that he does have is the audacity. [Richard sighs heavily] Baby? Richard look, [softly] I know that we haven't exactly had the smoothest time. That's why I've been doing some thinking. And I'm sorry that I haven't been the easiest person to deal with. Baby, I need you to know that I love you. [Richard sighs shakily] And that I know we can make this work. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah. [upbeat music playing] - [man1] Abeo. - [Abeo] Eh? - [man1 in Yoruba] Please... - [Abeo] Yeah. [man1] Don't we have, eh, beach resorts in Lagos? Eh, so why did we have to come all this way? Don't you want to see the legendary women of Kenya? I hear they cure prostate cancer. [laughs] [man1] Who told you that? - [Abeo in Yoruba] Me! - [man1 in Yoruba] Who told you that? [in English] Who told you that? [woman1 in Igbo] What are you two going on about? Your balls shrunk a long time ago. [in Igbo] Shh! That's enough! - [man1] Ah. Bedroom talk! - [Abeo chuckles] [Otis] Dele, Dele, Dele. [Dele] My guy, you guy. How was your flight? It was long but comfortable. Eh, the flight to your wedding must be comfortable. - Rita. - Hello. I can't thank you so much for trusting me with your wedding. You're welcome. And I can't wait to see the beautiful decorations. Oh, you will love it. Mwah! - This is TK. - Hi, TK. I want to see what you have done. Right now. Of course, Aunty. Please. Welcome. [Otis in Swahili] Welcome. [Otis] And here, ladies and gentlemen, is where creativity meets elegance. An outdoor experience is exactly what this reception needs. - [Rita wailing] - [Otis] What is it? Otis, when I asked you if you could do a Yoruba wedding, - what did you say? - I said I could do it. Does this look like a Yoruba wedding to you? What village idiots do you take us for? [Rita] Babe! What happened to the the message I sent to you? What message? I sent you an email with detailed instructions over a month ago. Otis, I didn't pay you money, to do a rubbish white wedding. I mean, what is this? No, tell me. What is this? - Dele! - [spluttering] What is this? Guy, guy... No tell me! Otis, if my wedding turns out to be a fiasco, not a single penny of mine will be invested in your company. Your son's temper is very questionable. Very questionable. No, I am concerned for Rita's safety. What can I do to make it better? Rita. - Rita, what do I do? - A lot. A lot! A whole lot! Everything! - Was it not your wife and daughter... - Mm-hmm. ...who almost kicked airport security this morning? I should be concerned for your son's safety. Greetings, everyone. - [silent dialogue] - [tense music playing] [upbeat music playing] Excuse me! Hello! [Rita] She's not answering. Excuse me! Hello? - Me? - Yeah, you. Who else? You're the planner we met earlier, right? You're the one responsible for this mess? Why won't you fix it? What is wrong with you people? Why are you so slow? You know, a wise man once told me, you are the reflection of the insults you throw at people. [laughs mockingly] Listen lady, I read my palms today. [in Igbo] I read my palms today. It said I'm going to slap someone today. - She's the one I will slap. I'll slap you. - [in Kikuyu] You'll slap who? - [in Igbo] I'm going to slap you. - You'll slap who? Are you mad? - No problem. It's you I will slap you. - Are you mad? Are you... [in English] What n the Nollywood shit is this? Are you mad? Come back, Patience Ozokwor. [in Kikuyu] Come! [upbeat music playing] [Otis moaning] [Otis moans] Oh, TK... What did you call me? Kate? [Otis moaning] [moans] Oh, TK. Get out. [sighs] [Celine] Excuse me. [Otis] Fuck! What? What is this? - It's a destination. - [TK] Really? Look, the place is a destination. - It's a destination wedding. - Hey, hey. - Look. [in Swahili] Look! - Otis. Destination. Wedding. What the fuck is a Yoruba wedding? Ah TK, what the fuck is a Yoruba wedding, tell me? [in Swahili] I swear to God, Rita is driving me mad! - Otis... - No, listen. I don't care. I don't care. What the fuck is a Yoruba wedding? At this point, I just want Rita to f... [comic music playing] What were you going to say? - Huh? - Eh? What was it you wanted to say? - [Rita] What was it you wanted to say? - Rita... - You see at this point, - Eh? I want you to forget - Forget? - about the fuss that is going on. And concentrate with the fuss with Dele. That's it. What do you want me to do? To the kitchen with the men. Men, why? - Why? - Otis! [mutters under breath] Rubbish! [Rita's mom ranting in Igbo] You silly cook! Come, you must cook this food the way I want it. Better keep listening to me, didn't I... If I cook it, one day I will break you. - [in Igbo] I will break you! - [cook in Swahili] Get out of my kitchen! Don't you understand what I'm saying? [Rita's mom in Igbo] Look, don't butt heads roughly with me. I will break you! - [Rita's mom] I will lock you up. - [chef] I'll burn your face. [in Igbo] Take a good look at me, you animal! Look at me! Are you all witnessing this? When I deal with him, eh! When I deal with him! You must cook it! Don't you know... [in English] Why did you remove the block of knives? Years ago, my mother had problems with the way that Ini was raising our child. When my wife had had enough, she chased my mother out of the house, with a knife! - [Abeo] No! - Ah-ah. - She's that dangerous? - Oh. Why are you still married to her? Abeo! The streets of Lagos are very dangerous. You see what I'm saying! Go. - [Khalid] Okay, what do we do? - [Ini] Do you understand? - [Ini] I will deal with you. - We are all friends. Come on, Chef, we are going to have to change the menu. We also got the information very late. Bro, I don't have any problem with that. I just don't appreciate being spoken to in that manner, especially in my kitchen. We're going to need him if we're going to make this work. [Ini] And now, gentlemen, this is my first item on my menu. [comic music plays] [in Arabic] Allah, protect me from this absurdity. What's in it? [both grunt in disgust] What's crack-a-lackin'? How ya'll doing? [chuckles] What? What? What? [Otis screams] Oh, no! - [Khalid laughs] - [chef] Bro, stop. Get out! [groaning in disgust] No. [soft music playing] - [mouths] It's nice. - [soft music continues] [TK] Guys, we just have a few hours to transform this into a Yoruba wedding, so I found some photos. So Judy, Celine, you set up this area to become a reception area. That will also give you time to talk. You coming with me to the florist and to the fabric store. And the... shit! TK, we need to talk about this buttercream cake. I think I'd rather a fondant cake. Why would you want a fondant one, what's wrong with the butter one? It's not elegant enough. [in Kikuyu] What an idiot. Listen, I'll have a fondant cake and that's not up for debate. Rita trust me, we are okay with what we have. TK, you will go to the shop, and you'll order a fondant cake. And that's final. Listen, you're more than welcome to go do it yourself. I'm doing Otis a favor. I could be doing something else like lounging on the beach and yet I'm here helping you. Oh, and FYI, it takes two to three days to bake and decorate a fondant cake. Good luck with that. [in Swahili] Leave me alone! Fine. - We'll have it your way then. - Yeah. [TK in English] Fondle, fondle, what am I fondling here? [in Swahili] You think I have nothing better to do? Don't bore me! [in English] You go eat, you carry some fufu and go eat there, shut up! I am so sick and tired of these Nigerians. I have had enough. I just wanna... [in Swahili] Speak of the devil, here they come. - Where's Otis? - He's here. Didn't he send you guys text messages or emails about the changes? - What changes? - We were meant to have a Yoruba wedding. I can't believe that idiot forgot to mention it. Who are you calling an idiot? [chuckles derisively] Are these the people you entrusted your wedding with? [in Swahili] Hold this for me. This lady's always rubbing my shoulder the wrong way. Let me tell you, I will beat you up till you won't remember if you gave birth to this girl or you farted her. You! [Abeo] Our people are great at being nice, - gentle and respectful to other people. - Mm-hmm. It makes you wonder what it is they are not great at. Well, being nice, gentle and respectful, to other people. - [laughs] Abeo. - [chuckles] [Rita] Who's your friend? - [in Yoruba] You're also a hacker! - [TK] "Yahoo!" - You're also a hacker! - "Yahoo!" - You're also a hacker! - "Yahoo!" - You're also a hacker! - "Yahoo!" [TK] Yahoo hackers, hackers of emotions. Get a canoe and go to Enugu and do it there. Nonsense! [TK] To hell with these goons! [TK] So how many are these in a dozen? [vendor] Maybe six. Oh, six? Oh, okay. And then maybe we'll get a bouquet like this one. And then, we add this. - [upbeat music plays] - [Otis laughs] Kagwe! ♪ Kagwe ♪ ♪ Hold up, wait a minute I see you eyeing me ♪ ♪ Hold up, wait a minute I see you liking me ♪ ♪ As you write to me, I'll write to you If you write to me, I'll write you too ♪ ♪ As you write to me, I'll write to you If you write to me, I'll write you too ♪ ♪ Dance.

[Dele sighs] Oh shit, that doesn't look good. You don't say. Do you need any help? I can manage myself. Yo man, I have two hands. The more the merrier. [Otis] Okay. Let's have a look with what we're working here with. [Otis] Hmm. It's actually harder than it looks. [grunts] Let's make it softer. Yeah. I like the way you think sometimes, lubricate it as much as you can. - Yes. - Yes. - Yeah. - Yes. - Yes? - Yes. - [Otis] It's going up. Yes! - Yes! [Otis] Yes! [whoops loudly] [Otis] Oh, yes.

Celine, I have a confession. Um... Judy and I... Fuck. Celine... we need to talk... Fuck! Who the fuck says, "We need to talk."? [Richard sighs] Celine. I just realized that you and I have never been on a beach together. So, do you wanna go for a walk? Um... Listen, Celine. There's something you should know. And it's going to kill me if I stay quiet about it. Okay. In the last few days, I've realized that, I haven't been the person that you need me to be. Maybe both of us just haven't been in the right... No, listen. If we're both going to evolve in this relationship together, then there's something you must know. What is it? Baby... I... I want you to have my last name. Are you asking me what I think you're asking me? - Celine Kariuki... - Yes? Will you marry me? Yes!

I may come across as someone who beats around the bush, but I only did that to protect myself from people who are out to get my money. I guess you have your reasons. Am I making the right decision investing in Otis? If I were you, I wouldn't drop a single dime. Two years ago, maybe. Right now, the economy is shitty, and even though Janta Linux connects the unemployed to the employer, there's really no ROI for you. Our clientele, the employers are either paying peanuts or nothing. Why are you telling me this? Because I don't like to beat around the bush. I have a proposal for you. For a year, I have been creating data clouds for small businesses. One of my clients has great connections with government and I need money to hire engineers to help expand. Right? Hey. I said, hey. TK, we need to talk about yesterday. [Otis] After a situation like that, we need to talk about it. What an idiotic DJ! He should have just mentioned that he was having issues with his visa. - Otis! - Hey. Kate! Otis. I'm impressed you can remember my name. How's the hangover? It's okay. I survived. How do you guys know each other? Uh, she's my maid of honor. Listen Otis, um, my DJ can't make it. Now I have to find a replacement. Uh, that's okay, I can DJ for you. You can? Thank you so much. That'll be amazing. So I have some equipment coming in in like ten minutes. - So you can... - You, DJing. How? What can I do to help? Thank you. You're a rock star. Please um, let's You don't even have a DJ controller. You don't have that. I can use an app, okay? You had uh, equipment. - Yeah, thank you. You are a rock star. - Okay, just send me playlists, songs, something to play around with and then I'll... we'll see what we can do. - Yo. - Hey. Congratulations bruv, you two are finally tying the knot. Oh, uh... Yeah. Yeah, thanks. Um, I finally decided four years just seemed a bit too long. I respect your bravery. Wait, what? Why? [Otis] Uh... You guy, it happened a very long time ago. It probably doesn't matter now, okay? - You're getting married. Congratulations. - Otis. Fuck, fuck. Out with it. Come on, just say it. Rita, you are so original, about having your traditional as a destination wedding over here. Get me a Kenyan man, so I can do the same. Well, good luck with that. Why would you say that? Finding a good Kenyan man is like, impossible. - No... - Especially you, Otis. [Otis] No. All of you had an opportunity. Our own Kenyan sisters are looking for your Nigerian brothers. [TK] A Nigerian man will take you out, spoil you rotten regardless of the money in his wallet. Yeah? And, in between the sheets, Ooh! He will satisfy you before he satisfies himself. Yeah, but we are telling you now. - But you still call yourselves my friends? - We're telling you now. - We are telling you now. - Ah, come on man. - That was a long time ago. - No. That doesn't explain it. That was a long time ago. - And your Kenyan men? - Useless. Hmm? Celine. Celine! When were you planning on telling me that you fucked Josh? When were you going to tell me? Baby, that was years ago. [Richard] Don't give me that bullshit. We were together, you could have told me. You had so many opportunities to tell me. It was a... I was in a different point in my life... And I wasn't even sure that I had feelings for Josh. Oh, so you decided to jump in the sheets with him, to get your answer? [Celine] Richard! And you know that Josh and I were tight growing up. I know everyone knows about you and Josh. I am sick and tired of hearing about Josh. Why am I the last person to know about this? And now I realize that was the only reason you invited me to that dinner. So that you could make him jealous. Right? You never really liked me in the first place. But in the end I chose you, right? This is why you can't be happy, Celine. Wasting our time with all this bullshit therapy, when all this time, you've always been comparing me to Josh but I will never be him. Will I, Miss Spontaneous? More like Miss Indecisive to me. Hold it right there, Jesus. As if you have a leg to stand on. What? Lead by example, tell her. Tell her! I think you should chime in on this conversation, Judy. Tell her! Wesley Pipes, you can't talk? Jada Fire, something you have to say? Bending each other over on these Swahili balconies, with each other's tongues in your throats. [Otis whistles in surprise] [Rita's dad] Abeo. This eh, Twitter dating dramas, they're so much more interesting than those eh, those couples that are always conflicting themselves on Oprah. Ah-ah. What are you two gossips doing here? They don't close the windows properly around here anymore. [singing in Igbo] Eddie Kwanza, bia o, bia o Celine. Who are you preaching to?

[TK] You've done a lot of talking by saying nothing. [Judy] Maybe things would've been different if we'd have told her to tell... Judy, if you and Richard came clean. Maybe things would have been different if we would have encouraged her to tell Richard the truth about Josh four years ago. Seriously? Wow. [in Swahili] What are you crying over? [in English] What the fuck?! [in Swahili] Drink up, just like you do the boys. [Judy sobs] Hey, boss. Why are you DJing? Uh, standing in for Rita's DJ. Yo, Khalid. I see you and uh, Dele getting a bit too close. Are you jealous? No. I'm just saying, if you need any help closing the deal, look for me. If he brings it up, you'll be the first to know. Why are you not dancing? Um... Just not in the best of moods tonight. Well, that's the reason why you need to dance. It will cheer you up. And I will enjoy seeing you. Thanks, but... I'm good. If I was a guest in this wedding, I would have grabbed you by your hand and took you to the dancing floor, and maybe to my room. I'm just saying. Listen, Nandi... I'm flattered. I really am but... you forget that I came here with someone who I happen to love. She's important to me. And I'd like to do right by her so... Let's just leave it at that. And besides there's more than a few guys in there who are dying to mingle with you tonight.

Hey, what's up, fam? When can you send the rest of the... Otis, today is my wedding day. You know what? I was going to save this for later but now is probably better. I will not be investing in your company. Wait, what? Why? I decided to go in another direction. Man, come on, be straight with me. What's up? I saw the financials of your company and it doesn't look promising. It's a family business. That's why we need your help. With your help, we can weather any storm. Is that what you meant when you said my portfolio could be better? Come on, man, - I kept my end of the deal! - Yes, you did! - But it was messy. - Then fulfill your side of the deal too. You know the beauty of this is I'm not obligated to. We're done here. - Ah, no. - Best of luck with everything. No, no. Stop this stupidity. Fuck you! [yelps] Ten thousand Shillings says that they are about to take your son for his honeymoon in an ambulance. - Fuck you! - [Otis] Fuck you! Fuck you! Hey, hey! - Fuck you! - Hey! Hey, Otis! Leave him alone, Otis. Let him come at me. Ah, no. Come! [Otis in Swahili] Let go of him! [Celine squeals] Richard! What the hell, Otis? [Otis groans] - I'll double it. - Hmm? Dele will put him in the sea. Unusual. Did you not see the right hook from the Kenyan? I will triple it. Put your money where your mouth is. Ah-ah, this one? This one? This one is not strong. This is "Rumble in Mombasa" not "Rumble in the Jungle." I've always had bad anxiety. Nowadays they call it something fancy, ADHD. TK, I feel like I messed up everything. You haven't lost anything. You just look at the world with the wrong lens. You still have your company. Khalid has proven he can lead, let him. And you have friends that love you so much. So much so they flew across the country to help you plan a wedding, despite us hating them all. And I mean you have a fair share of women to be used when needed. Used! Again with that word, Jesus! I wonder why? Again, kicking a guy when he's down. You know what, Otis? You want to stand here and feel sorry for yourself, be my guest. You know, I was doing just fine standing here by myself. Okay? I didn't need your insights. You always rely on me to come clean your mess. Always. And you never, ever show me gratitude, Otis. Ever! And when I try to make myself vulnerable to you, you... I, what? Never mind. What are you doing here, TK? Why are you helping me? To be used again? Cause this is what we do. You cry for help. I come to the rescue. - For what, Otis? - Say it, for what? Don't tell me what to do, Otis. [yells] Then tell me what you want! You! Fuck! What is this shit? And why am I the only one pouring my heart out if all it leads to is a dead end? What's all this for? You fall in love, I fall in love... We start speaking about forever... We start feeling those mushy, fuzzy things inside and then... And then, what? What? Then we get bored. We start feeling fuzzy for someone else. And you know what happens? Another broken heart. Pretending that it doesn't hurt, and because we're men, oh men don't feel any pain. You ladies can curl up together, drink your wine, pour your feelings out. What do I do? Do I call my guys to drink whiskey? No, fuck that shit. Ah-ah. Well, I guess we are just in different places in our lives. TK, don't blame me if I'm not the guy that you hoped I would be. Why is it so hard for you to try? If I had known you'd be this scared, Otis, I wouldn't have bothered. What's that supposed to mean? I don't know! I don't know. But what I do know... The fear that's in your eyes right now, Otis... is the same fear I saw the other day when I gambled and kissed you. Let's just pretend nothing ever happened, ever. I'll send you the financials and... Please, take your time. Of course. Next time you are in Lagos, let's play some golf. Absolutely. Thank you so much, guys. Bye. Bye. Look. I know it's none of my business, but I do think you and Otis would make a really cute couple. There's a time I would have believed that but there's just nothing there. Let me tell you, there was a whole situation. Nothing happened, because he was literally saying your name the entire time. But they're clearly feelings there. - Hey. - Hey. What's up? Judy, I don't think I can do this. I hate flying. You know, it's funny how we all just deal with different fears. Celine and Richard, they drove back? Okay, first of all, this isn't fear. Yeah? And yes, they did. It's hectic! You know, we should have all just chartered a flight. [Otis] Hmm! [automated voice] Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention? - Announcing the arrival of Flight - [Judy] That's us. - Yeah. - Nine-zero-J-one-eight-six-zero-five... ...boarding of passengers... Okay so look, I know it's none of my business but you and TK barely spoke to each other after the second day. - What happened? - [Otis sighs heavily] She has some feelings, and I don't know what I have. Wait, wait, wait. You're the guy she was rooting for? Wah, okay, now it all... Now, it all makes sense. What do you mean? The night before the trip, [Judy] Um... the ladies night we, got high and, TK mentioned someone special. Dude, you got high? Wow. [Otis] Wow. It's not like I planned it. I also didn't plan to fall in love. Okay. What if I do, and then it fails? TK will never want me to be a part of her life again. I can't. You have to give it a try. What if I fuck up? Then it will have been worth it. And if not, at least you get to fuck them. Oh my God! Judy! Alcohol!

I also came to say that I'm sorry. Sorry for being a dickhead to you. Go on. I'm also grateful. For everything that you've done for me, ok. Go on Otis. Come on, TK man, I am trying. Okay, fine, I'll stop. It's all fun and games to you. I was doing just fine, then you show up here ready drag me back to your shit. I was hoping we could make it our shit. It doesn't even sound the way you want it to sound. If there's anyone who is more deserving of a genuine loving relationship, it's you. If there's anyone I'm vulnerable with, it's also you. I'm saying this is a friend. I have a question. And a comment. What if I told you, I don't want to be friends with you anymore? What would you do? I'd respect your decision. You were right that day. I was scared. What was the comment? Seems like... seems like fear has vanished from your eyes. [wistful music playing] [in Swahili] The baby is doing fine. You're due in about eleven weeks.
