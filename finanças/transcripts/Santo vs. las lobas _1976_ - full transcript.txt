Queen. Is the anybody here? Respond. Come, Queen! - Come. - Queen. I shall die a thousand times and be born a thousand times. - All secrets are within me. - No. - And the strength of centuries... - No. ...in the past. I am the unshakable destiny... ...of the offspring of the eternal moon. Please. Queen, you have come to hear your inevitable future. You shall be the White Queen. The chosen one who will realize the prophecies... ...and last forever. Today, this century... ...on this day, the first cycle of the great moon is fulflled. And I, Luba... ..shall die... In order for my life to be united with yours. You will mark... ...the destruction of humanity. And you will signal the beginning... ...of the eternal rule... ...of lycanthropes. Carry out your duty. Do it! Do it. Lord of Darkness... I'am coming to you. Lord... ..place my soul insdide of her... ...so I can live again. Luba. Luba. Luba! To her. One, two, three... Step back, get out of our way... This is El Santo. He'll blow you away! Step back, get out of our way... ...this is El Santo. He'll blow you away! El Santo's dressing room? This is it. Just a moment. Santo, somebody's here to see you. Let them in. Come in. What can I do for you? I wanted so much to meet you, Santo. Really? You're famous, and so enigmatic. You're a challenge... for any woman. Thanks for your compliments. You're modest, Santo. A strange quality in a man like you. I suspect you didn't come just to flatter me. You're right. I want to get to know you better. Why? All in due time. I'm sorry you can't accept. - Hopefully after your tour. - It'll be a pleasure. See you soon, Santo. Let?s go, Dragon. Santo? - My name is Jaime Pons. - Yes? I'm a private investigator. I have an urgent matter to discuss. May I? - All right, come in. - Thank you. What can I do for you? I've been asked to talk to you. But I must say it's and absurd, unlikely-matter. His name is Cesar Harker. He lives in a little village in the mountains. Marsh. Have you heard of that place? No. See for yourself. - Werewolves. - Lycanthropes. What kind of joke is this? Listen, Santo... ...I understand your reaction. I reacted the same when I was told: But there's something more. Not only is my client an honorable and sane person... ...but the tone of the letter. I don't understand. The conviction in those words. And above all... ...the concern and terror they express Raad this paragraph. "I know you'll say I?m mad... ...but I?ve never had a clearer mind." Lycanthropes exist. "Please, Mr. Pons... ...convince El Santo." He is the only being in the world who can help us. What do you say, Santo? I don't know. I refuse to believe in legends. I see you think I'm mad, Santo. But just let me tell you this. They exist. Yes. I know they exist, but don't you think it's too late? Well... These are the instructions in a case you decide to do it. This is my card. I'm staying at the M. Isabel hotel. Call if you decide to accept. And I hope soon. Goobbye. Lycanthropes. Go! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Please, help me. Hurry. What is it, Santo? This dogs. The dogs? What dogs? Look, it's... Stop! Please. Help. Open up, please. - Open it. - Go up. What happened? I was attacked. Please, let's go. What happened? Tell me. I was attacked. Please, save me. Relax, I think we got away. Who attacked you? Them. The lycanthropes. Lycanthropes? It?s whiskey. Want some? Yes. Thank you. Go on, drink it. It's good for you. Better? Yes. It was horrible. Thanks to you I survived this nightmare. I get chill just thinking... Forget it. That's all it was. A nightmare. My pleasure. Maria Isabel Sheraton Hotel. Mr. James Pons, please. With pleasure. No. Listen... I'm sorry, sir. There's no answer in Mr. Pon's room. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Santo, see you tomorrow at "The Mansion". Kilometer 189 on the highway to Queretaro. Have you been bitten by one? You're in terrible danger, Santo. That's why from now you fate is inevitably linked to my plea. How so? What do you want from me? You must help us end the curse of the werewolves. There's no time to waste, Santo. We must succeed. ...before the accession of the Red Moon. Help! Cesar. - Get a doctor, quick. - Yes, sir. How are you? - Fine. - What happened? I was taking her out, and... ...she tried to drown me. How is she? I sent for a doctor. Where is he? Who knows. She got up and hit me. That's right, Santo. They're trying to get rid of me at all cost. Why particularly you? It's been a battle of generations. Since long ago, my ancestors... spread out throughout the world... to try eliminate lycanthropes. And they... They grow every day, like a plague. Anyone who's bitten by one... becomes a werewolf on the first Red Moon. Anyone... except my family. We're immune. That's why we're natural enemies. And that's why they... ...want my death to look like an accident. Like today in the pool... ...or like yesterday. Yesterday at the golf club. I was playing, and... They've created such original ways of killing me. On that occasion... we didn't know who to blame. - What will you be having? - Fruit juice. - And you? - The same. Nobody at the club discovered... who was the golfer who was so keen on hitting me. What do you want from me? My protection? No. But I figures you fit right into the legend. How's that? I don't understand. The book of Licars... ...says that only a silver symbol can eliminate them. Your mask is silver. What should I do? For the time being wait. I'll tell you the whereabouts... of the Great White Wolf. Meanwhile, take care of yourself. I'll see you very soon. I have a fight tonight. Step back, get out of our way... ...this is El Santo... ...he'll blow you away. Step back, get out of your way... ..this is El Santo he'll blow you away! No! Men. Whats going on, Manuel? Did you hear that? What's going on, men? - Let's all go. - Yes. let's go. Let's go see the boss. This way, men. It came from this direction. Yes, come on. Heavens, it's the boss. It's the boss, what happened? He was bitten. - He seems to be dead! - He is. He's dead! It can't be. It was the white she-wolf we saw at the village. - Let's go get her. - Yes let's. Let's go get her! This way. There she goes. Over there, there. Don't let her get away! This way, come on. Over there on the rock. Let's go get her. Don't lose sight of her. - We're close. - Yes. Juan. Pedro That way. She won't get away. - Quick. - Let's go. Come on, men. She must be here. - She must be around here. - Break up. Come on, come on. Lets surround her. Come on, men. Hey, she's over there. Catch her. Dismount. - Wha thappened? - We have her surrounded. Where'd she go? We have to walk. She won't get away. Let's go. - We got her. - This way. Here she is. We've got her here. Careful, Manuel. Yes, be careful. - She's dead. - She's dead. May the Lord protect us, mistress, Julieta. The queen she-wolf is dead. No, Ana Castro. Listen... Listen to them howling. They claim revenge. Ana. You've got to watch them. For God's sake, you must. Eloisa and Adriana... ...must be protected. Listen. Mistress Julieta wants nothing to happen. Make sure nothing does. Uncle. Gipsy, please. Don't lock me up, no. Uncle, Gipsy. Gipsy. I also want you to lock the room of my... ...daughter Eloisa. And do, quick. Uncle. Gipsy! Transylvania. Good evening. Don't be alarmed. My mask is at the service of justice. I'm El Santo. El Santo. In the Silver Mask. You scared me to death, buddy. - Sorry - Ah, don't worry. I was looking at that box It only says where it came from, but not... ...who's sending it, or where it's going. Weird, isn't it? Those damn wolves. What did you say? Those wolves have been howling... ...all night, all over the place. - Coffee? - Thanks. As I was saying it's a large pack. They're like the devils henchmen. Suffice it to say that... ...nobody dares go out at night anymore. May I use your telephone? I must speak to Mr. Cesar Harker. - Do you know him? - No. No. That telephone puts you through to the police station. They can give you information on that person. Come with me. That's the telephone. You can talk. Police headquarters. Captain Pacheco speaking. Do you know where I can find Mr. Cesar Harker? Cesar Harker? Who is this? El Santo. I'm a friend of Cesar's. I'm at the train station. I'll send someone to fetch you. Thank you. No. Cesar. Cesar is dead. I'm Erick, his brother. Shall we go? Have mercy on us. Brothers. I salute you. Brothers. This is Licar. King of lycanthropes. I've come to join you... ..to eliminate the last of the Harkers. Licar. Brothers. Licar. The Silver She-Wolf queen has been killed. We must choose her successor. On the coming of the great Red Moon. When every human being who received... ...the grace and blood of our race... ...will be come forever subjects of... king Licar. Oh great Red Moon. Select among my subjects. ...the one to be the successor... ..and be the Silver She-Wolf queen. You shall be the queen of wolves. Good afternoon. Have you seen or noticed anything strange lately? Anything strange? We haven't seen or heard anything. Get out! Good afternoon. We don't want anything to do with you! You should get out of town, Santo. You're crazy? Crazy! - Out! - Yes, get out of here. - Get out of here! - Out. We don't want you here. Out. - Get out of here. - Out. - Get them out. - Out of here. Get them out. It's logical, Gipsy. People are scared and very aggressive. - Flee, Gipsy. Flee. - Don't let them get away. After them. You idiot, don't shoot. Don't shoot! You idiot! You idiot! You killed two of ours. Let's go before thet catch us. Gipsy. Gipsy! Would like some, Santo? I couldn't get here sooner. I'll explain later. All right. Calm down. That was his destiny. Allow me to introduce you to my fianc?, Eloisa. - Pleasure. - Nice meeting you. Dr. Jeremias Marcus, Eloisa's father. I've heard a lot about you. I'm Adriana Marcus. Pleasure meeting you. The pleasure is all mine, miss. - This is our chief of police. - Pleasure. Chief Pacheco. It's old man Matias. He was found dead at the station. Seems to have been the wolves. When didn't happen? Could have been at dawn. Doctor. I need your services to certify his death. All right, Let's go. - Gipsy, take them home. - Yes, doctor. I need to speak with you. Later, at your house. Shall we go? (REBOBINA A CENA) Seems to have been the wolves. When didn't happen? Could have been at dawn. Doctor. I need your services to certify his death. All right, Let's go. - Gipsy, take them home. - Yes, doctor. I need to speak with you. Later, at your house. Shall we go? And so... At dawn. It was definitely a wolf that killed him. Chief, come with me. I want to show you something. Okay. Let's go, Erick. There was a box from Transylvania last night. I don't understand. - What did you say? - There was a box... ...from Transylvania here last night. That's where lycanthropes come from. - It's possible that... - Superstition, Erick. You're influenced by the madness going around town. Let's go, I have to perform an autopsy on her. Are you coming, Chief Pacheco? Yes, we are. Why are you wasting your time? It's just... - ...a corpse. - No, doctor. According to my peons and foreman... ...it's the She-Wolf who killed my brother. Those are superstitions that people make up. However, if you wish... ...come with me. She's been dead for over a month. Impossible. She was brought in yesterday. Chief Pacheco... Are you going to teach me medicine? No, doctor. Like I said. Over one month dead. Tell me, doctor Marcus... How do you explain that the agonizing she-wolf... ...was found at the hut, instead of this woman? Did anybody see the she-wolf... ...go to into that place? Gentlemen... ...forget that nonssense. I'll be expecting you for dinner. Erick. l'm a she-wolf. No. What you're saying is nonsense. - Don't worry... - Yes, darling. It isn't nonsense... I know. l've been terrrfied of facing this horrible truth. But when they... ...said what happened at the station... And it can't be a nightmare, Erick. I saw myself leave the house... ...cross the field and blend in with some unclear shapes. Then I recognized the station... ...and then... Everything was a veil of blood. I killed him. - It isn't you. - Yes, it is. It can't be. Look. Take this. This amulet will protect you. You won't have anymore nightmares. - Doctor Marcus? - Yes. Did you come to Marsh just to visit the Professor? Not precisely. I came to do zoological research... ...and happened to hear about the professor's presence. What kind of research? Evolution. My intencion in coming here doctor, is... ...to ask you... To honor me with your presence at dinner tomorrow night... ...with the most relevant people of the village. Well... - ...unfortunately... - Father. Please, we can't turn his invitation down. Besides, Santo and Erick will go with us. Not just them, doctor... ...but so will you. Unfortunately, I won't be able to attend. My sister Julieta is not in very good health.
