I stole it from mom. Okay, at least we'll always have it now. Green leaves of autumn -Hello. -Hello. Dante, I'll charge that to your grandfather! Dante, don't step on my flowers! It's okay, Eva. -Hi, mom. -Hello. Something's burning. Tell him to eat it all the same and if he won't, to go eat at the inn. You tell him that. Dante,... Dante,... have him give you some money, since he didn't give any to me and here we don't sell a shit. And there's nothing for dinner. -Okay. What are you staring at? I need money. -They asked for one more book. -Go make a photocopy. It's more expensive. Again these stuck noodles? Does she do this to me on purpose? -Because you keep being late! -Not at all, that's what your mother says. I didn't see you arrive. Do you drink at whatever time? This is from last night's. -What about your medication? -There. I'll take them now. -Where are they? -You are your mother, now? Come on, take them. Sure. One? I'm watching you. Dante. Hi. -How's it going? -Fine. -Will you attend Melisa's party? -Yes. After recess we'll arrange it. I can lend you some clothes. Hey, stay away from Melisa, huh! I don't want to see you tonight at the party. OKAY? Calm down. Alkyne hydration is an "electrophilic" addition reaction, not "electrophile" as most of you say. And it can be represented schematically by an equation like this... The oxygen - hydrogen group is added to the more double bond' substituted carbon atom. This is the most important industrial method for manufacturing ethyl alcohol. CH2,... This way this ethylene hydration is done in the presence of sulfuric acid. That's why in brewing wine the main process is the alcoholic fermentation... Don't touch the merchandise, old man. I meant to help you. Some crap, these eggs. -You don't get big eggs anymore. -Of course, chickens come in small sizes now. Bad mood today, old man! Huh? I eat poached eggs. Look. -A shame. Like dove eggs. -But there's nothing else. What can we do? Here are the oranges. This goes for this morning's one. Now he likes stealing fruit in the morning, when he rides by. -How much is it? -20. Fine, thank you. Let's go. -See you tomorrow. -See you tomorrow. -What happened? -Nothing, it's a joke I play on him. What's the joke? [inaudible] Why did you fight the greengrocer? [inaudible] He wanted to sell me an egg... an egg like this. Like dove eggs. [inaudible] -Grandpa, you have a visitor. -What? Bah, again! Don't hurt her, huh! -Here, here. -You'll kill her! Brute old man! I'll cook it. That's what I'll do. In a pot. -Bitter man! -Pickled. Who was this, grandma? -Put that back in its place. -I had never seen this picture. Do you want me to stay for dinner? I won't eat tonight. Isn't white wine for women? That's what your father used to say. You used to drink red wine. It was on him. When will you make peace with dad? Ask that to him. Here. It seems we'll eat today. We're leaving tonight. There's a cane for you. We return on Sunday. At dawn. Are you going to miss the party? Gonzalo lent you a shirt. Well, then later you give it back and that's it, right? No. I'll stay. I'm going to the party. Hey... Raise your foot. How important is that party? Hey you, I'm talking to you! Where is it? Melisa's. And that's why you don't come fishing? But nothing's going on with that Melisa! You don't know that. I want to go to the party. Fuck off from this house! I can't stand you anymore! I don't want to see you anymore. You disgust me, disgusting drunk! Pig, filthy! I don't want to live with you anymore! You get it? I don't want to live anymore! Leave! Enough! No, don't touch it, you'll cut yourself. Off with you, go at once! Come on, David, let's go! -Who's there? -Dante. -Who? -Dante! David! Come in and close the door, I'm in the bathroom. -I'm sleeping over. -What? I said I'll sleep here. Huh... is that you, Dante? Is there fighting in your house again? Here. What a splendid day! Where are you going? -Hello. -Hello. What are you doing so early? Nothing, I came to walk grandma. -Come on, Meli! -We are a lot. Else we'd drive you. -To the mass? -To the cemetery. -To the cemetery, on foot? -Yes, she told me to go with her. Okay. Will you come to the party today? Er... yes. -Dante, what are you doing? Let's go! -Well, bye. Let's go! Hi. -Oh, old man, please! -How are you? Listen, don't bring any more of these curtains. I have all of them in here. Eight, you brought. You know? They don't sell at all. -What should I do? Take them away? -No, not that, but... Let's do this: when I sell some, I'll ask for more. -These don't sell, either? -Neither. How come? How much are they? 9. That old woman. She takes the kid to the cemetery crossing the town. Bye! -That was your grandfather, right? -Yes. That old man is very lonely. You noticed? He didn't even look at me. You didn't say hello, either. No, no, my son, that man doesn't like me. He's just like your father. And I'll tell you something else: I don't like that girl. You don't know her. Ha! I don't even know you. Even so I still love you, grandma. -Grandma, it's over here. -No, dear, it's over here. Come on, grandma! I don't know why they make the letters on the plaques so small! You can't see a thing. Come on, come on, it's over there. Ouch, dammit! Elvira! Look where you were! Can't you see, grandma, that it's there? We come here every Saturday. I know it's there! How can I not know? Go get water from the private niches, in the "virgo" zone. VIP, grandma. It's the same water! It's not the same water! That water is contaminated and flowers rot. But it's on the other side! Do it for your grandfather. No, not from there, from the faucet of the rich! I already told you. Go there. -Hi, ma'am. -Hello. -Is Dante home? -I think he's with his grandma. Will he go to the party tonight? I think so, and he is going to wear your shirt. -Thank you. See you later. -Bye. Get out, come on! What for does she want hens if she won't take care of them? It's unbelievable! Don't kill her, huh! Here, the chicken. Take care of her, so she doesn't get hurt. Is he sleeping? It's useless for you to fix this for him, he won't drink it! I know. Gonzalo was here. Are you going to wear the shirt he lent you? Yes, since I don't have any! You'll need money. I didn't sell a fucking plant. They won't even buy lettuce. Here. Did he give you money? That's weird! No, he didn't give it. The old woman next door was looking for you. Your son? And my grandson. His name is Mateo. But I don't know him. He always says that they'll come, that he'll come... but time passes and... And that? The blender. I paid for it in cash. I must eat everything minced, everything minced! Even the mate! But I don't chew the mate, I suck it! We can make banana smoothie. But there are no bananas. Wait for me here. -Will you pay for it, or your grandpa? -I'll pay for it. Did you know that your grandpa doesn't buy eggs here anymore? He says he has a laying hen. What a liar, that old man! It'll be 20 pesos. Do you know about invisible ink? What's that? Bring that notebook there. It can be made of milk or lemon, but I prefer lemon. It's an old method used in war. Some prisoners used it to communicate with each other. Only he who knew the method, the way, could decipher the message. First you have to let it dry. You're quite alike Javier as a boy. The same haircut... the same anxiety. Javier? My son. He's living in Madrid since many years ago. You miss him? I hope I'll get well so I can travel and see my grandson. It's done. Ready. Grab the lighter. Pass the lighter under it without burning it. It just needs to be heated. [Thank you, Dante.] Do you want me to stay? No, easy, he already left. Go have fun. Anyway don't you argue with him today, since you already know how he is. You've grown cute, Dante. Luis, I saw Mirta. Why don't you go see her? I promised her you'd go. Come on. You want me to go with you? Stop busting my balls! -Luis. -Come on, gather that there. Come on, my love. Let me see. [inaudible] -No, just in case. -One, just in case. No, later, later. And that perfume? Oh, come on, it's the shoe store's regular skinny girl's! You fancy the skinny girl! It's one of the few things I don't have. I don't wear perfume. Men don't wear perfume. You fancy the skinny girl! [inaudible] Off with that pretty shirt. Let's see, let's see, let's see... Oh, let's see this great macho! Should I breathe you mouth to mouth? You want that? Luis. Take a deep breath. Come on. Like this... that's it. That's it. Go ahead. That's it. Breathe. It's over, it's over. It's over. I'm fine, I'm fine. Will you please stop? -Be good! -No, you be good! Will you please leave? -Stop! -Come, come. -Come, what? -No, come on. -No, what? Oh, let go of me! Release me. Because I told you 8 times to let go of me. Hands off. -Don't touch me anymore. -Release her, you idiot! -Stop it! -What's wrong with you? -Release her! -What's wrong with you, idiot? Release me, release me! I'll kill you! Stop. -Dad! -Go, grandma is waiting for you. -Hey! -What's up? Is Dr. Subino here? Not Subino but Rubino. There she comes, look. How is my dad? Okay... Wait a sec. Kid, for the third time! I told you: you have to wait. The therapy doctor will come soon and he'll explain everything to you. I've been waiting for three hours and nobody tells me anything! Give me back my cell phone. -Tell me how my dad is. -Please give me my cell phone back. I'll call you back. Where is your mom? -Is he going to die? -Where is your mom? -Tell me, it's the same. -It's not the same. My mom was here and she won't return. See, the situation is complicated. But with help from the family he'll come through. No, there's no family. I'm alone. Tell me. What needs to be done, and I'll do it. You may go rest at home. What's up? Why don't you two break up? You'll leave early tomorrow. And I hope you won't come back. And I thought that your mother's juice was disgusting... Sorry? Any other complaints? You didn't answer me. I won't answer you. And your brother? He went fishing. He does well. But, at least I am here. He's in a common room. Do you want me to go with you? I won't go to that place. Hi. He'll be discharged tomorrow. -Do I serve you? -Okay. Did you fish? Little bit. The boys took it. We eat nothing but vegetables. You could have brought something. They were catfish. It's better than cooked mate. Why don't you two break up at once? Go straight home, you! Don't give up, Luis. Carmen! Good day. How are you? -How are you? -How's it going? See, I was thinking I'd like to bring a little joy, color, to my kitchen. What do you suggest? How about an Impatience? Can be. How is Luis? I learned that he was admitted again. I heard about it in the bakery. Awful! Alcohol, what a crap vice! How awful you must be! And the boys. Alcohol destroys not just he who drinks it, but all those around, too. It's like smoking, right? One does not smoke, but anyway all those around poison you. It's a disaster. Maybe pansies, petunias... a flowery evil to give color... to your life. Daughter of a bitch! Are you coming? No, I'm going home, my old man must already be there. See you later. He left. Chase him, kid. -What happened? -Dad? Is he sleeping? He already left. He's in the streets. I wanted to tell you but I didn't dare to. Who's she? She's a friend of my old woman. Your dad always comes by. But who is she? I don't know who she is. How should I? She's a neighbor. A whore neighbor. I brought you this, this will do. But grandma, I already have one. This will do. Hey you, and this? This is because mosquitos suck blood, here. How cute! How is your father? -No change. -No change? Will you stay for dinner? -Yes. -Yes? And to sleep over. Okay. What are you doing? What happened? Come on, pick that up. Dad has another woman. Better so. I'm serious. I'm serious, too. So you think what he does is right? I don't say it's right. That's your father's bussiness. I won't mess in. Come on. Pick up those pliers, come on. Are you Dante? What happened? She left us. She was less alone thanks to you. You did everything I couldn't. You even taught her to save money. And I thought those savings were for coming visit me in Madrid... But no. They were for buying you a new bike. We talked a lot. Yes, you talked, had fun, played cards, you fixed her garden... You did a lot of good to my old woman. And that's why she left happy. Every time she talked on the phone she just talked about you. Dante is happy, Dante is sad, Dante this, Dante that... One day she talked so much about you, that I hung off on her. And we didn't talk for three months. And your old man? As usual. And Mateo? She also talked about you and of her grandson. She wanted to go meet him. We do what we can and in the meantime time runs over us. Mateo missed meeting and enjoying the grandmother that you enjoyed so much yourself. Once mom told me: "Dante is a green leaf "in the middle of a deep autumn. "There aren't two Dantes." I admire you. Thank you. Where were you? David? He'll sleep at grandma's, I think. You arrived early? Are you making amends? I took the medication, too. Come. -Were you at grandpa's? -Yes. He has a chicken that gives him large eggs. He's happy. I reckon that. Where did you come from? From the workshop. How strange, I passed by and there was no one. Must have been when I was to Beto's for a while. -Did you take your medication? -Yes, I already said I did. Dante. It's 11 AM, get up. The old woman's son brought you this. She had something bad in her throat. Seems she was alive when she wrote it to you. I mean she thought of you before leaving. I don't want that here in this house, take it off. I don't want dead people's things. You should look for a job. To help your mother and your brother. Yes, I know, grandma. You can't all depend on your father. What do you mean? In case someday he's missing? No, I didn't say that. No, but you thought about it. Well, yes, I thought about it. I won't take dad's place. I don't want to. What are you doing here? Are you thinking of Melisa? Hey? Well, when will you take action? She doesn't care about me. I know two things: Meli is with you, and you lack push. It's not that easy. Why do you take so long? What are you waiting for? -Well, it just doesn't happen. -And how does it have to happen? There are big problems at home. Well, in my home too. So? You don't understand. I do: you just give it too much thought. Do you like her or not? -A lot. -So? I don't know how to do it. See: write her something nice on a paper, give it to her, and then ask her out. Okay? Go ahead. I think you're right, grandma. Melisa is not for me. What, she said no? Not yet. To win a war you have to fight, said your grandfather. Anyway he never went to war. You are just like your brother. Just like him. The very image of him. Lie down, please. What? Do lie on the floor. It's not so difficult. Please. Watch your head, careful. That's it. What do you see? -The lamp. -What else? -Your panties. -Brat! Look where I tell you. What do you see? -What's that? -A drawing. I know. But who drew them? Was it David? Yes. But don't tell anyone. Did you get it? Nobody. Your brother had his own war but he couldn't make it through. I thought you had lost it. Since you never come by... Did you go fishing? Just from the shore. You must walk the river. Else you'll only get wet. That was what Dad said. And that's how you met grandma. Something like that. Walking the river, yes. She was pretty, your grandmother! Did you have other women? That's not to be asked! No, no. I never had another. You expect someone? Who is it? Ana Mar?a, Mr.! Oh... how are you? -Excuse the timing. -Not at all! How is your son? I heard that he was admitted. He's better. He's much better, yes, yes. Oh, are you accompanied? My grandson, who never comes by. -Oh, sorry, sorry! -You don't bother. I hope the chicken didn't bother you anymore. No, not at all, it doesn't bother me anymore. I brought you some cake for tomorrow, for breakfast. -Oh, thanks! -It's warm. -Well, thanks, thanks. -It's for not killing my chicken. -Goodnight. -Good evening, Mrs.. -Sorry. -What? Can I sleep over or is there a change of plans? No, since I saw that the neighbor... Oh, come on! Why don't you kill the chicken and you have dinner together? She's dead for you! -Hi, mom. -Hello. He hasn't come yet? Didn't you pass by the shoe store? No. I didn't pass by. I came straight from grandma's. What's that? The clinical studies he didn't take. And he doesn't take his medication. This will end very badly. Come on, I love this. Come on, move it! What a rush! This is good, I like it. Move it, move it, come on. Oh, what cold hands, wait! What a tickle! Now I'll eat you, now I'll eat you. You're going to cut off your hand! Why do you look at me like that? I didn't drink a drop of alcohol, I spent all night with the railroad men. In a meeting. Mom found some studies that you didn't take and medication you didn't take. That's my bussiness. You're fucking selfish. You can't talk to me like that. Fuck off. I don't ever want to be like you. -Hello. -Hello. You need something? Is Melisa home? -And who are you? -I'm Dante. Oh, you are Dante! Meli hasn't arrived yet. -Would you like me to tell her something? -No, no. Bye. I'll tell her that you came by, anyway. David asked me to come live with me. And it's not the first time he asks so. I of course said no, since his home is here. Please, mom, don't preach me. Don't you realize that they are never in your house, your children? They can't stand him. This house is empty, mom. Then do something. Are these yours? It was your father's gear. And why are they here? He never comes take them... I guess he doesn't go fishing anymore. So... use these yourself. I don't fish anymore. Dante! Dante, how grown up you are! Did you see him or you didn't? Shhh... Yes, I saw him, he was in a very bad shape. I told him to go home. I forced him. He didn't let me go with him. -Grandpa. -What? -Didn't you see dad? -No. Why? -Because I'm looking for him. -So... he must be in your house. No, he's not home. Besides, he wasn't well. And, well, what do you want me to do? He's always poorly, your father. What happened here? What happened? I left it locked. What's up, Luis? Sonny? Dear Luis... Luis... dear Luis... my baby... We managed to stabilize him but his situation is still pretty serious. so we'll move him to intensive therapy. Okay? What happened to him? .. obviously, by not drinking alcohol, he fell into that delirium caused by abstinence. Luis had to take the prescribed medication. You told me he never took it. That did not help; it worsened the situation. Okay? What's next? Well, we believe it's best to move him to intensive therapy because there we'll take better care of him, he'll be more watched... -Can I see him? -No. Not now. You better go home and let's see how he gets through the night... Tomorrow we'll decide. Surely tomorrow you'll be able to see him. Won't you go see him at the hospital? No. He's in therapy. So? Mom won't go either. And what do you want me to do? Forgive me. Can't we stay at grandparents'? Your grandfather is grumpy and your grandmother lacks room. And what's the problem with staying here alone? That we don't have money. That's why. I still have some money. Oh, mom, you already lent me too much! I must hurry because I have to take the bus and wait for the ambulance. The taxi arrived. Help me. And hurry up, your aunt is waiting for you. Hello, welcome! I was waiting for you. How grown you are, Dante! Give this to me, I'll help you. How was the trip? All right? Do you know that in grandpa's workshop is daddy's gear... half hidden? The fishing box? He said he lost it. Another lie. A drop in the ocean, right? -Was the reel there? -Yes. A black, old one. It was a fast Mitchel from 1957. With that I learned to fish. Daddy taught you? It doesn't matter to you if daddy gets well, right? Right. Everything that has to do with dad doesn't matter to me. I saw the drawings under grandma's table. We all want the same: may everything be as before. Some things won't change. I have faith that they will. I'm happy for you. You're still a child. There are things you don't know. What I don't know? That dad has a lover? -Did grandpa tell you? -No. I saw it myself. And you think it's right? No. I don't think it's right. But we can help dad get a life of his and mom one of hers. Aunt is right: you've grown. So? Let's see: daddy one day... stopped being daddy. I don't know why. Nobody knows. Daddy doesn't even love that lover of him. I don't know, something happened... so everything stopped making sense... for him and for me. I feel that daddy died on me a long time ago. I still like you to be positive, but I can't myself. I always? am afraid to end up being like dad. No, fish... you are not like dad. Fortunately. Come on, let's stop talking nonsense and start fishing. Hello? Yes. Yes, they are here. What happened? Tuesday 9, test to prove everything you learned... everything you learned, exam on Tuesday... ... individual groups, but do study. On books, notes, wherever you want, but please study... So please put on your batteries as expected... -What's that? You're leaving already? -Yes. I have no teacher. Look. Hurry up, else somebody will steal her from you. See you. -What's this? -For you. It's a secret. But it's blank. [I love you] [... to Grandma Elena.] [Green leaves of autumn]
