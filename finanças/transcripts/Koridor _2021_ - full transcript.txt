You bought so much. They're all things we need. This has gone off. Throw it in the rubbish. Put this on the table. Sis, you've overcooked it again. You know I like my eggs soft-boiled. If you don't like my eggs, boil them yourself. My eggs aren't good enough for you! Turn off the heat when the water boils... and wait five minutes. That's all there is to it. I'm not boiling any more eggs, okay? If you really want eggs, you can boil them yourself. It's time we cleaned the house. Okay, sis. Don't you see the state I'm in? Don't lift a finger, I won't either... and let's drown in our own dirt! It was fine when Emine used to come. If only we hadn't let her go. Never mind Emine. If we'd left the house to that floozy, we'd have died of dirt. Nesrin dear, welcome. - Hello, Zeliha. I wanted to say... - Come in, come in. No, not now. Your bathroom's leaking again. Not again. But we had it fixed. That was last year. If you saw our ceiling, the paint's blistered all over. Are you serious? Come in, come on. No. Seeing it reminded me of last year. Of course it did. We'll get it seen to. Now, come in. No, take them off inside. I was just making coffee. Sis, Nesrin is here! - You like a little sugar, don't you? - Yes. - Welcome, Nesrin dear. - Hello, Muyesser. Come through. Sit down. - Welcome. - Thanks, Muyesser. - How are you? How's life? - Same as ever, Muyesser. Running around, housework, the kids... It never stops. You're right, it doesn't. There's never time to relax. We're lucky to have friends like you. Thanks, Muyesser. At least you call by every so often. Hasibe never asks after us. You wouldn't know we were old neighbours. She never visits. Oh, please, Muyesser. If she doesn't visit you, visit her. It's not that simple. I'd happily visit you, for instance. But I don't feel like visiting her. But then everyone's so busy, you shouldn't get upset with anyone. Here's the coffee. - Thanks. - I hope it tastes good. - Has Nesrin told you, sis? - Told me what? Our bathroom's leaking again. Really? We had that bathroom fixed last year. Believe me, Muyesser. The ceiling is full of blisters. Please get it seen to so we avoid a repeat of last year's fiasco. You say people are busy... but she had everyone over the other day. - Who? - Hasibe. Oh. - Did she ask you? - Yes. I dropped by that day. How are you, Nesrin? How's it going? Same as ever, Zeliha. Nonstop chores. - I can't make time for myself. - You can. You're a great girl. And so pretty... If only! Forget any personal grooming. Grooming is for those who need it, dear. You don't need... Everyone needs grooming. Neglect yourself a little... and see how your man's eyes wander. True. Muyesser is right about that. No, come on. What nonsense! Anyway, I should go. Why are you going? We were having a nice chat. The kids are alone. They'll be expecting me. Muyesser, please. Take care of that bathroom. God willing. Come again, Nesrin. Goodbye, sweetie. When she goes to Hasibe, the kids being alone isn't a problem. It's only when she comes to us that it's a problem. Scum! Hypocrites! And you, telling her she's... so "pretty", that she needs no grooming. You're prettier than her. Her and her hatchet face! - Come on, sis! - Stop it, girl. - Come on, please! - Go away. Look. Watch me. Zeliha? What's wrong, girl? - Ow! Wait a minute. - What's happened? It feels like a knife stabbing into me. Come over here. Come on, over here. Honestly, you have the mind of a five-year-old. - At your age! - What's wrong? For heaven's sake, I wanted to have some fun for once. At your age! Wait, let me put that cushion there. Put your head on it. What's wrong with my age? Wait, let me help. "At my age"! What else am I supposed to say? Wait. Wait a second. If I can stretch out this leg... - Where does it hurt? - Right here. - Shall I get some hot water? - No, no. Don't. Oof, it's winded me. Wait. Okay. - Shall I put something over you? - No, no. Don't. - Are you all right? - Yes, fine. I'm fine. Sis... Turn on the television, will you? - Sis... - Yes? You know what I have a craving for? Can you make us some nice artichoke? I've been dreaming of it for ages. Okay. I'll do it. The pensions will be paid in two days. I was planning to go shopping anyway. - Sis. - Huh? Where are the nail scissors and emery boards? In that brown box. But where's the box? Down below on the right. Sis, what are we going to do about the bathroom? Hello, Bilal? How are you all? I'm fine. Keeping busy with chores all day. I can't complain. Good luck with that. How's Necibe? Thanks, say hello back. What are you up to? Really? Poor you. You shouldn't have to work so hard at your age. We miss you, too. I just thought I'd call. Of course, yes. Of course, whenever suits you. Say hello to Necibe. Goodbye. What did he have to say, sis? He said hello. I hope you said hello back. They're working so hard at the moment. - Sis. - Huh? We must get the bathroom seen to. The hell I will! It cost me a fortune last year. Am I supposed to get it fixed every year? I'm going to the shops, Zeliha. Okay, sis. Don't be too long, will you? You haven't moved since I left you. Are you ever going to get up? Hmm... Delicious! Beautifully cooked. Glad you like them. The best broad beans I've ever eaten. How did you cook them? Don't be so daft! The same as always. No, no. You put something else in. I swear I didn't. I'm really enjoying them. You cooked them beautifully. Enough talking. Eat up. Sis, it's scalding hot! It's scalding! That's enough. It's okay, I'll do it. Ekrem was so good at peeling oranges. He used to peel them by hand and feed me the segments. And his hands would get all sticky. The poor man, he didn't deserve to die like that. May he rest in peace. You want him to rest in peace now? You never had any love for him when he was alive. What, me? The man always had it in for me. I remember the days when he didn't want me at your house. And you never said a word. Oh, please, sis! You didn't stop sniping at the poor man. You picked holes in everything he said. The "poor man", huh? You were always turning your back on me. I haven't forgotten those times. Be fair, sis! I always came to see you apart from the four months I was pregnant. Exactly. So I wouldn't come to you. Maybe Ekrem sent you to stop me coming. I don't know. You have such an evil mind, sis. Enough of that. I knew the day Dad died that I'd be alone. It was just you who lost Dad, was it? That's how it seemed at the time. You're unbelievable, sis. That's the limit! Hello? Is that Sevim? This is Muyesser. Did you get the message about me? There's not much to do. It's a small house. If you come every two weeks, that should do. Of course, we're at home. We're always at home. Any time is fine. How much do you charge? 150 lira? That's a bit much, isn't it? We'll let you know. Okay. I'll phone you. Goodbye. Look at the state of this cardigan. Ah! Take it off and I'll mend it. Forget it, sis. It's time I threw it out. Take it off. It won't take a minute to mend. We haven't bought anything new for years. As if we can afford it, Zeliha. We need to watch what we spend. We're not girls anymore. No, I know. But I can't help wanting new things. We have nothing presentable to wear in public. If it weren't for Mum and Dad's pensions we'd be in a sorry state. It's okay. It's okay. Sis. Thanks. Shall we go to the cemetery tomorrow? Yes, let's. Sis, it's time we had the bathroom fixed. You're not just stubborn, you're obsessed! - Sis. - What? Are you mad? Did I say something wrong? I wish to goodness you had! Oof, sis! I'm going out. Zeliha? What's wrong? - What's wrong? - I don't know, sis. Are you okay? Yes, wait a moment. It's probably a chill. I felt achy all day. But you haven't been out. How did... - Are you okay? - Yes. It's my lousy immune system. Wait, wait. Wait, sis. Let go. I can get up. Let go. I'll get up by myself. Let's go to the florist on the corner this time. The cemetery one is so expensive. Okay, sis. Wait a moment. Wait. Sis. Has it started again? When did it start? Two or three weeks ago. Have you been to the doctor? I'm fine now. - The pills help. - What did he say? I'm cold. Let me fetch a cardigan. Sit down, for heaven's sake. Even I am quite warm. It's not cold. Don't make a fuss. I told you, the pills help. I really am cold. Let me fetch a cardigan. Can you get one for me as well? Try this on. Sis, did you buy this for me? Yes. Good, it fits. It looks nice on you. Thank you, sis. Why did you do it? Why not? You needed it. - Don't you like it? - No, I love it. What did you buy for yourself? I'm fine as I am. Sis, what did the doctor say? Do you need an operation? He doesn't recommend a second operation. Harder. Harder. Press harder. Dad used to call me whenever his shoulders seized up. As if I could make it better. I was always busy with something. Then he'd change his mind and call you instead. He was always worrying. He'd say, "Muyesser, what's to become of this girl?" "She'll soon be starting a home and family." "How will she manage?" "What will she do?" He always felt sorry for you. Yes, he felt sorry for us. He felt sorry for you. He thought of me a lot... but he felt sorry for you. You're right. He did feel sorry for me. Mum was the only one he didn't feel sorry for. Dad adored Mum, Zeliha. But she was impractical like you. She just couldn't run the house. I ended up doing everything. True, but... It doesn't matter now, sis. He used to say... "If you can't even fix a shoulder, how will you hold on to a husband?" He wasn't far wrong, though. Look at me. The poor man died before his time. Who? Dad? No, sis. Ekrem. I miss them a lot. I miss them, too. It's been a long time. Zeliha. Zeliha. Come on, let's go to bed. You're all scrunched up here. - Sis. - Huh? Should we phone the plumber? I'll call in at his shop. Phoning isn't going to work. I got you a new cardigan and you're still in the old one. That's for special occasions. I don't want to wear it out. What special occasions? When we go out, I don't know. I'm going to the shops. Don't be too long. I won't. Hello! Nesrin dear, welcome. - Come in. - No, I won't. I asked you to get that bathroom leak fixed... but you just don't seem to care. Nesrin, we called Kazim the plumber. And? He was out on a job. But we'll try again. We will get it fixed. But aren't there other plumbers? I thought you were a better neighbour. If you can't afford it, say so and I'll get the plumber in. For shame! What a thing to say, Nesrin! You know workmen are hard to get hold of. We'll get it fixed. Spare me the shame. When, for God's sake? When our house is swamped? Of course not. Okay, Nesrin. Look, I promise. Okay, you promise but... Look, just tell me if Muyesser doesn't plan to get it fixed. Okay, Nesrin dear. We'll get it seen to. Now, come in for coffee... Oof! What's coffee going to fix? When are you going to call in on the plumber? I did just now on my way back. He's coming next Wednesday. Not until Wednesday? The girl was at the door again. - Who, Nesrin? - Yes. What did the slut say? Her bathroom's leaking, what else? She's exaggerating. I know what she's like. You can't blame her. Did we have to take so long about it? Did I have a chance? I have to do everything! You could've called yourself and done something for once! You never give me a chance! Nothing I do is good enough for you. Give you a chance? The house is filthy and do you lift a finger? If you hadn't fired Emine, it wouldn't be so filthy. We got rid of the girl to avoid giving her a 20-lira rise. I fired her and did I put you to work? I still do everything. Why didn't you say let's keep her? Because I don't have a say in this house! Not even in the house Ekrem left. What nonsense! You're set on kicking out the tenant... but we won't find a new one... and we'll be left high and dry. What do you mean? Is it you and me now, not us? That dog Sait is always late paying rent. That's the whole point. Otherwise keep your damn Sait! It's not just Sait. You don't like anyone! One person's a floozy, another a dog, another a slut. You drive away everyone around us! What, me? Only me? Yes! We'll die all alone in this hole because of you. Ah, what a hateful person I am! God damn me! God strike me down! Why are you cursing yourself? Stop it! God damn me! God damn me! God damn you in that case! Sick woman! Maniac! You know what? You're crazy. You're a psychopath. You make me crazy, too! Come on, let's eat. We're both starving. Hello? Bilal? Dear? I'm fine. How are you all? How's Necibe? Bless her. Really? When? Well, good luck with it. Yes, true. We're fine. She's fine, too. She says hello. Don't wear yourself out. Okay, we'll come when it's done. Say hello back to Necibe and Sevcan. Kisses. Okay, dear. They've started doing up the house. They'll ask us over when it's finished. Shall I make us coffee? You must've read my mind. Sis. Sis. Get up and let's go to bed. Sis, what's wrong? Nothing. - Have you cut your hand? - I told you, it's nothing. Oh, dear! Damn you electricity people! Where did we put the candles? God... Zeliha! What?
