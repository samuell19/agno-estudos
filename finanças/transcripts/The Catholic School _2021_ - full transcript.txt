NETFLIX PRESENTS BASED ON THE BOOK "THE CATHOLIC SCHOOL" BY EDOARDO ALBINATI Open up! Get us out! Get us out! Don't go away. Or else they'll come back. Please. 6 MONTHS EARLIER I couldn't say when it all began. Get in line! - That story concerned all of us. - Straighten! Our education, our neighbourhood, our school. After that, nothing would ever be the same again. One, two. One, two! One, two! One, two! One, two! I want to hear your voice. One, two! One, two! One, two! One, two! I was in my junior year at a private high school, with monthly tuition fees. Girls were not admitted. We were all boys raised in a middle-class neighbourhood of Rome. Rich children, to be precise. One of my classmates was Salvatore, Angelo's brother, who was a year older than us. I want to see more energy in here! And then there was Picchiatello, Pik. So called because he was a very weird individual, with an actress mother we all fantasised about. Gioacchino Rummo, perhaps the only one who really believed in the Christian values that priests were trying to instil. Except Brother Curzio. Who if you looked closely, didn't even seem a priest. Running in place! One, two! One, two. Arbus, these look like spasms, not high knees. What are you doing? Come on! Higher! One, two! One, two! One, two! One, two! One, two. One, two. One... It was 1975, and violence was the order of the day. What happened, Pik? Romoli. He crumbled under questioning in front of the headmaster. - Oh, it's true! - Grow up! Be a man, for once in your life, won't you? D'Avenia. You didn't see anything, did you? Like everyone else, right? One of your mates is attacked in the middle of the courtyard and no one saw it? Fine. If you have nothing to say, well, go. Romoli wasn't bothering anyone. As soon as the bell rang, the seniors approached him and they surrounded him, to prevent the others from seeing what they were doing. At first, they just gave him a few slaps. Then one grabbed him by the shirt and started tugging at him. So his glasses just fell off, did they? No. They broke them on purpose. I see. Now tell me who did it. - No. Ask Jervi. He's the one who sent... - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Like to hear it from you first. Guido, your father is with the headmaster. They're young, but they still have to understand that we have rules here. Your parents decided to send you to this school because, obviously, what they want for you is a safe haven. Something to shelter you from any kind of moral drift... Headmaster, excuse me. I wanted to ask you. Have you already started collecting donations, maybe for Holy Easter or... Not yet, but, uh... You should let me know. Let's go now. Let's not trouble him further. Thank you. Gianni, can you tell the janitor to send me Jervi? What possessed you? Hmm? What did I tell you? Huh? So? You made me look like a fucking moron. Come here. What did I tell you? Huh? Don't you ever dare do it again! You must never do it again! I got it, sorry. You made me look like a fucking moron. Like a fucking moron. There are changes tomorrow. - Our life was full of rules. - Get out of my sight! When we happened to break them, sometimes we were punished. Other times, nothing happened. So we felt that those rules had been put there at random. At the age of six, you get out of your family bubble and enter school. Another bubble. The risk there was to acquire one of two attitudes. Subdue or be subdued. Give them to me! You can't take them. - Stop! - You're always stealing. - Stop. - I'll tell Mum. Stop, stop, stop. No, no, no, no! - Rachele stole my shoes. - It's not true! Don't lie. I don't care. You two sort it out. Elisabetta, can you turn off the oven, please? - I'll be right with you. - Okay. Toby. Come on, go with them. So? See, what... what I don't understand is that they didn't... they didn't do anything to them. I mean, they didn't take any measures. They'll just buy him a new pair of glasses, and that's it. It all ends like that. So in your opinion, what were they supposed to do to them? Humiliate them in front of the school? Suspend them? And how did this human justice treat the Lord? It treated Him with hatred, with a thirst for revenge. Evil begetting more evil. The behaviour of Gioacchino's friends must be understood and forgiven. Otherwise, we'll enter a spiral we'll never escape. Dad, aren't you the one who keeps saying that forgiveness should only be granted after confession, not before? Yes, but I'll also tell you not to put too much trust in perfection. No, I have it. And take heed of prejudice. Stop, stop, stop. Enough arguing. Girls. Here we go. Good. Giaele. Food's ready. In the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit. Amen. I'm not in the mood. Why? Because I'm fertile right now. And I don't think it's a good time to have another baby. Well, why not? Why not? I'm the one who'll have to carry the baby, right? Come on, we already discussed this. Please. Hey! Big hair! Nice hair! - We got him in front of everyone. - His glasses? Snap! Tomorrow they'll have tape on. Whoo! - How did it go with your father? - As usual. He gave me a fucking hard time, but in the end, he stopped it. He said he won't let me out any more. What about you, Giampie? Not a word. - Didn't say anything? - Hardly surprising. Your granddad built that school. Exactly. Plus, with all the money my father gives them every year, the headmaster should keep his mouth shut. That's it. They're fucking pissing me off. Well said, Angelo! - Wanna get a drink? - Yes. Okay. - Hey, Angelo. - Hey. - Andrea is about to be released from jail. - What? I've just been told. It's gonna be soon. - Are we gonna be here all night or what? - What do you want to do? I don't know, really. Let's decide something. In fact, I think I have an idea! Put it back! Angelo. - What? - Where have you been? Where do you think I've been? With my friends. Why do you always make me worry? Worry about what? I'm here now. I'm fine. Come on, I'm going to bed. Look, I know you're awake, okay? Gianni told me what happened at school. - What did he tell you? - That they questioned you. Yeah. The headmaster kept us at school 'cause he wanted to know who did it. - And did you tell him? - No. Are you sure? Well done. You kept your mouth shut. Never be a snitch. - Understood? - Yes. Yes, what? You should never be a snitch. Any other sins to confess? - I tell a lot of lies. - That's bad. Lying is a serious sin. What kind of lies? All kinds. In order to be accepted by others, for example. I pretend to have the same passions. The same ideas. I shouldn't do it. It makes matters worse for me, Father. ST. LUIGI HIGH SCHOOL Because in the end, I feel lonely. It seems as if I'm comfortable with everyone. And I get along with everyone. But I'm never really comfortable with anyone. I'm never really my true self, Father. You seriously told him during confession you don't believe in God? What if he reports you? I'm leaving this school, anyway. I'm not learning anything here, and I don't trust the teachers. They should know stuff. Instead, they don't even know that they don't know. They just assume. Their authority is based on nothing. So, who do you trust then? I trust you. I think you've chosen the wrong person. Now, it's reduced to a simple quadratic equation. Which I imagine you all know very well, right? So what's your plan? Once you've solved the quadratic... I'll do two years in one. I'll get my diploma another time. You know, you need to have a B average in all second-year subjects. And take all third-year exams. - I know. I know. - Arbus! Seeing as you're enjoying chatting this morning, come to the blackboard. Solve the equation for us. Come on. This one? Yes. Arbus. Considered by all of us as a phenomenon. In a way, he was worshipped, and thus kept at a distance. Okay, Arbus. You may return to your seat. The greatest thing about Arbus is that he would never flinch and never lose hope. Arbus had all our admiration. Jervi had it too, but for other reasons. ♪ Pressure building ♪ ♪ Your blood is pounding your baby ♪ ♪ Take it slowly ♪ ♪ Don't be rushing ♪ ♪ Now take ♪ ♪ Your time ♪ ♪ Let me show you ♪ ♪ Guide you, going down on baby ♪ - The body of Christ. - Amen. - The body of Christ. - Amen. The body of Christ. The body of Christ. The body of Christ. - Mum. - The body of Christ. What? - Why can't I ever take the Communion? - Because you can't, sweetheart. - But why? - The body of Christ. Shh! It's just the way it is. When you grow up, I'll explain it to you. - The body of Christ. - Amen. Let us pray. In the name of Christ, our Lord. Amen. - Gioacchino. - Yeah. How come I'm not seeing any of your school friends? Don't they attend Mass? Yeah, they attend the compulsory ones at school. Oh. What's the point of sending their children to a Catholic school? Maybe their parents work. They don't have the time. I get it, but not even one out of 20 boys. It's quite absurd. APOLLINAIRE'S IMMORAL TALES Mum! - Sweetheart. - Didn't you see the car? What would I do without you? - Hey, are you all right? - Yes, yes, yes, yes, I'm fine. I'm fine. 5 MONTHS EARLIER We could build a nice little house here, if we get the permits. Huh? And we could already split the property. One for you, the other for your brother. That'd be nice. We can do that. Look. Ruma. Again. You get emotional. I've told you before. You have to be cold-blooded. You aim. You fire. Let's go. The three pillars of our education were persuasion, threat and punishment. But rather than pillars, they were more like steps. Failing explanations and threats, we then had to be punished. In my neighbourhood, great ambitions were either lacking altogether or manifested themselves catastrophically. The underlying moral was this. Everything that was transient was unbearable. And since everything is transient, everything was unbearable ultimately. Except in the Arbus family. Good morning. The father taught mathematical logic at the university. He seemed to be more interested in his students than in his children. Okay. This is identical to your house. My father built it for my sister. He was obsessed with a hacksaw and balsa wood. Come on. Bonjour. I've got you a snack. Mum, please. Monsieur. - Hello, madam. I'm Edoardo. - Hey, Edoardo. How are you? Oh. My son is so absent-minded, isn't he? What's in this big head of yours? Secrets? No. No secrets, of course. What about you, Edoardo? Do you have secrets? Me? Yeah, the things you don't tell your mum. What are they? Tell me. Hmm. I actually rarely tell my mother anything these days. - So... - Never mind. What are you studying? - Chemistry. - Mmm! Well, since we know chemistry already, why don't we play a game of poker? You're brutal. Call. I fold. Two pairs for me. Straight. Put that stupid sword down. You'll hurt yourself sooner or later. Mum, you see how skilled I am, don't you? I'm starving. Oh, you want food. - I'm starving. - Ugh. Call Fernanda. I have a headache. Fernanda! Fernanda! - Why are you shouting when I just said... - Fernanda! ...that my head hurts. Fernanda! Fernanda! Can you, for once, stop being a clown? - Coming! - Yes, all right then. Go. Enzo! Enzo! Enzo! Enzo! Enzo! Enzo! Enzo! Enzo! Enzo! Enzo! Enzo! Enzo! Enzo... Guys, keep it down. Sorry, Brother Curzio. - Ha! - I wonder, what are we here for. - The one on the right. - Where's my bed? - Oh, I'm gonna take that one. - No, not you... Wow. Come on. Where did you find that? Why don't you guess? Under the bed. Under the bed. Under the bed. Pik, look, look, look. - It's there. At the bottom. - It's not there. It's there. There. You have to look closely. So fucking dumb. - Who? - You. - Me? - Yes. So, I asked you to come here this morning because I'd like to begin this conversation of ours in front of this painting. Simply, I'd like you to tell me, in your opinion, what you see in it. Go on. Freely, freely, freely. Well, professor, they are men beating Jesus. They are six men beating Jesus. Your thoughts on how these six men should be defined. They're persecutors. As persecutors. And who's the victim? Well, Jesus. Are you sure? It seems to me that the persecutors, too, are victims. Because those who hurt others hurt themselves too. - Right? - Right. I'd like to add that they're not the only perpetrators. Jesus is too. He's clearly utilising their evil in an attempt to rise above them. - In order to be perfect. - I see. Isn't the perfection in this painting a betrayal of arrogance perhaps? No. Good is perfection, which means that perfection is God. So I believe you should start considering that the devil perhaps manifests itself when we are on the good side. When we feel that... we feel we are inebriated by our perfection. So you're saying that when we behave well, we're following the devil's suggestions. Therefore, there isn't any real difference between the saint and his tormentors. Of course there is a difference. Jesus is human too. He took on human form. As a man, he takes part in our imperfection because he holds inside the seeds of evil. We become men by inheriting evil. By perpetrating evil. And being victims of evil. But to be a victim of evil, someone must surely perpetrate it. What then? You're not convinced, Gioacchino. I... I don't know. I, uh... I believe we become men by doing good deeds. Seems you're saying that we only become men by perpetrating evil. I don't... I don't understand. And therefore Professor Golgota is talking nonsense this morning, huh? Psst! Hey, all clear. Let's go. - Where are we going? - Hurry up. Let's go. - Me? - Yeah, yeah, come. - Hey. - Hey! What are we doing? We're doing a re-enactment of the painting we saw before. - And what's this got to do with me? - You're the protagonist. - Get undressed. - You're Jesus. - Come on. - Take my shirt off? Yes, yes, exactly. Bare your chest. Get naked. Okay. - Here? - That's it. - Come on, on your knees. - On your knees! Oh. What are you doing? Ow! - Ow! - You sinner. Hey, that's enough! - Coward! - Stop it! Yes, that's enough now. - Say you don't believe in anything. - Renounce your god, you snitch! Renounce your faith. Renounce it, D'Avenia, come on. Renounce it. Hey, what the fuck are you doing? Hey! Have you all lost your mind? You sinner. You like being flogged, huh? Being born male is an incurable disease. That sissy boy deserved what was coming. You had to be ready to do all kinds of things in order to obtain the approval of your peers. You had to show you were strong, even if you were weak. Every day, you had to prove you were a real man. And once you'd proven it, you had to start again from scratch and prove it all over again. If you failed once, you would be marked forever. TOMORROW NIGHT, 3:00 A.M. THE DEVIL'S CHAIR I don't like cock. Say it. - Huh? - And ladies, do you like them? Yes, of course. What do you like about them? Uh... If the question's too hard, tell me what you don't like about men then. Body hair? Their beards? - Well... - Whatever. I'll tell you what you don't like. You don't like their cock. I don't like cock. Say it. I don't like cock. Say it! I do not like cock. 130 HOURS EARLIER - Come on! - No! Come on. Come on. Hi, girls. - Hiya. - Hiya! Where are you going? I'm going home. What about you? Can you give us a lift? We missed our tram. - Where to? - To Montagnola. - Where's that? - Montagnola! Uh, do you know Grotta Perfetta, Laurentina? - Close to the EUR? - I see, the EUR! - Yes. - It's far away. - Hmm. - Oh, well, get in. - You're struggling. Can you open it? - Oh, my God! It wouldn't open. It's like a spaceship! Have you seen how they get better? Soon they'll be making flying cars. By the way, my name's Donatella. She's Nadia. I'm Carlo. Later on, you'll have to give me directions. - I only know how to get to Colombo St. - Of course we will. What do you do? Do you work? No, no, I'm in my last year at school. Oh. So how do you own something like this then? It's my father's, but I use it often. How about you? What are you doing around here? We went to the cinema. We saw The Rocky Horror Picture Show. - I haven't seen it. - Yeah, and it's insane. ♪ Toucha, toucha, touch me I wanna be dirty ♪ And wasn't it screening in cinemas near you? Oh, is it really too much? It really seems to bother you giving us a lift, huh? No, no, what? What? It's not. I was just curious. I'm just joking. A friend of ours who's a photographer lives near here. He's offered both of us to work on a shoot together. So what is it you do? We're models. I mean, we'd like to be. I see. I'm sure you guys will be great models. - Can I ask you for a cigarette? - Sure. Thanks a lot. - Voilà. - Very kind. - Do you mind if I put it on? - Yes. - Do you like Battisti? - I do. Hey, you're not singing. Thanks again. If you want, call us. Okay, sure. Thank you. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Bye. See you. Sweetheart. Hey. Sleep now. Sleep. Under the blanket. There. Good night, Giaele. Mummy. And the prayer? Come on, say it. Dear Jesus, please watch over Lia, Mama, my big brother, Daddy, big sister and little sister too. Please don't forget Tobia. Well done, my love. Very good. Now sleep. Come on. Accepting an invitation could be risky. But turning it down meant to lose masculinity points. That's why it felt like a privilege when my presence was requested at the Devil's Chair. The secret of our education was to let the steam out. Otherwise, it would build up. But one could not take things too far. Otherwise, one could have drifted into fascism. Hey, where were you? We've been waiting for an hour. I met two girls. I gave them a lift home. Why didn't you bring them here? They wanted to be driven home. Home? Where? - They live far away. - Far, where? In Montagnola. There's no way with their filth. - So you went out whoring! - You're the one whoring. I know how to deal with girls, eh, hey-hey! Come on, guys. Anyone would know how to deal with them. They can't even speak. Whatever. It's not like we need to talk to them. Introduce us. - I see. - As if they'd give their number. - What the fuck are you talking about? - Look there. Look at this, eh? - Dream on. - Look at that. - On his little hand. - His hand! See the master at work, boys. See the master at work. - On my hand! See the master at work. - Let's call them. - Come on. - Key's in the ignition. Let's go. Come on, boys... We were the first generation who enjoyed virtually limitless freedom. Our families seemed solid, but in reality, everything was more fragile than it looked. Edo! Edo! Can you help me with the test? No, Pik, I can't... Fathers were absent. - Help me. - Pik's father, for instance. No one had ever seen him. No one knew anything about him. But no one had had the guts to ask Pik where he was. Shall we say three o'clock? 3:30? 3:15? 3:30 is fine. "E profundam." Ablative? Ablative. Yeah? Yeah, one second. No, accusative. - Accusative? - Yes. Okay. My mum's beautiful, right? Before I was born, she was an actress. She was fabulous. Mama! Mama! - What are you up to, Pik? - I'll introduce you. - Mama! Mama... Aah! - No, no. There's no need. Really. Mama! Mama! God! Why are you yelling? Uh, I wanted you to meet Edoardo. - Yes, good morning. - Good morning. Well, thanks for coming to help my son study today. No, it's nothing. - Well, he needs it for sure. - Where's my snack? And you're asking like that? Uh, I'm supposed to ask how? Tell me. I don't know. Look at your friend Edoardo. Huh? Is he someone who asks his mother for everything? I'll never make it. If you don't get going, for sure you won't. Come on, I can't be late. - I'll dictate. - Okay, thanks. "All of the dangers..." "All the..." "...of death..." "...dangers of death"? 3 MONTHS EARLIER Cockroaches have been living on Earth for 320 million years. They are fast. And difficult to kill. This is because they have an exoskeleton, which is sturdy, but at the same time, flexible. It's a body that can mutate. Change. And everything that causes change is violent. On the one hand, violent changes destroy, but on the other, they create. See? I should kill it exactly here, just here, in the chest. Then yes, he would die. That would be the easiest way. Same goes with people. You know, it's pointless to waste time looking for a way to kill a man. We shouldn't think about it too much though. Sure, a dagger through the chest would be a terrible way to die. Hey, bear. Hurry up! I'll see you next week then. - Thanks a lot. Thank you. - Sure, yeah. Bye-bye. - Stay with us. - I have to go. - All right. - Thank you. It became clear to me that in that family, the madness of one member ended in the oddities of another. Arbus wasn't a violent guy. Yet, he was obsessed with death. Even if Arbus' family was attracted to evil, perhaps Professor Golgota was right when he said that in order to become men, it was necessary to go through evil. Hey. Hi. - Remember? Monica? - Hi. We met last summer at the national reserve by the sea. Oh, yeah, Monica. Sorry. Up to much? Yeah, I was, uh, going home. In the end, you never did call. Because I'd lost your number, so I couldn't... It's okay. I'll give it to you again. Let me write it here, so you won't lose it again. Bye. See ya. Even if none of us would have admitted it, we were deeply scared of sex. It was a mystery that had to be unveiled. And we were attracted to it without understanding why. Some used it to achieve freedom. Others used it to destroy. Oh, and, uh, Mama, he's, uh... He's one of my schoolmates. Stefano Jervi. Have a good evening, madam. Bye, Mama. About the present, you get one? - I got one together with D'Avenia. - What did you get him? ♪ Let me show you, guide you... ♪ How's it going? - Yeah. No, exactly. - Totally. Can I come with you? What's that? Please, just this once. - Brought your little brother. - You like it? Let's get something to drink. Come on. What's new? Andrea is out of jail. - Fuck, finally. Where is he? - Yeah. He passed by before. You'll find him at home. Oh, it was tough, but he held up, didn't he? - Fuck yeah. - It's not easy. - Now we'll have fun. Now we'll have fun. - We'll have fun. Now we have to celebrate. To Andrea! To Andrea! To Gioacchino! Happy birthday! Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. I'm beginning to get fucked off with you. To Gioacchino! Ready for a special dish, are you? Spaghetti with clams, sir! You're a buffoon, Pik. Stop it. Would you like some more wine, by any chance? Monsieur needs to drink more wine. I don't know what it is. You've finished already. - I'll take it from the table. - Pik, enough with this shit. Gioacchino! Gioacchino! Gioacchino! Gioacchino! Gioacchino! Hey, Sara. Who's she? She's a girl I know. And why didn't she say hi to you? I don't know. She must not recognise me I guess. - Come with me. - Where? - Just come with me. - But where? Come with me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Do you know my brother? Salvatore. Oh, yeah. Hi. All right, is that it? What do you mean? He's handsome, isn't he? Get a drink together. Actually, I have to go home. You'll go when I say. You like this one? Oh, where are you going? Look at me. So do you think yours is golden or what? You think you might be too cool for him then? - Huh? - Please, leave me alone. Now you beg me.

Albinati. Thanks a lot, professor. Arbus. Your essay is correct. It's even well-written. But it's void. There's no passion, no emotions and certainly no personal interpretation. I have no personal interpretation myself for an essay in an Italian class. I know you need a B average to graduate early, but this essay doesn't deserve more than a C. Benazza. "I would argue the greatest man in recent history was Adolf Hitler." Professor. You're always talking about socialism, of democracy. But then you won't allow an essay about a chosen historical character. Is that democratic? Democratic, huh? Are you telling me Adolf Hitler was democratic? Sit down. Be quiet. Try to understand what you read, when you study. And use your head. Think about it, Benazza. Think about it. Guys, hi. Good. You? I'll see you around. Hi. Oh, hi, how are you? - I'm good. You? - Good. I'll see you, okay? - Perhaps you want us to help. - I'm missing a screw. Oh, a screw... - Oh, I think I saw one... - No, Mum. I'm on it. I see you're working on it. You seem in trouble. I want to help you... I think destiny is the name of the line that draws people's lives. Leda's destiny concerned me deeply. We feel immensely grateful to those who inflict pain on us as soon as they stop doing it. Go get your father so we can make a fire. This explains why some women stay with their abusive husbands. It's those moments of respite that make them love their husbands even more, as they've been so kind to have temporarily stopped mistreating them. Dad? Dad! - We'll be ready soon. - Yes. I'll be with you in a minute. Is everything ready for the fire? Yes, my love. 70 HOURS EARLIER - Hi, Donatella. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. - Hi. - Hi. - Angelo. Hi. Donatella. - Nadia? - Nadia couldn't come, sorry. She had to go the funfair with her baby sister last minute. Oh. This is Rosaria. Sorry. I have to make a call. - All right. - I'll be right back. Yeah, sure. Okay, what can we offer you ladies to drink then? Uh, whatever you order is fine for us. You've been friends for a while? - We're more like brothers. - Oh. - And you? - We're neighbours. Oh, you're from this area, right? - Pretty much, you know? - Shall I get you something? What happened to you? You left half an hour ago. I don't wanna hang out with them, Angelo. I figured as much. You even got them to call you Carlo. At least be our wingman, will you? What do you stand to lose? It depends how long the film is. Do you have to be home a certain time? - Are you up for it, Rosa? - You made up your minds? - Yeah, yeah. - Hmm. - Here we go. - Oh. We were planning to go to the cinema on Monday. Nadia is coming too, right? Yeah, I believe so. Are you joining us? Yes, okay. Perfect. Are you coming then, Rosa? - Of course she's up for it. All right. - Yes. What's this? Where's Dad? LETTER BY PROFESSOR LUDOVICO ARBUS I'M A HOMOSEXUAL, I CAN NO LONGER LIE He left. He's realised that he likes men. Didn't you know? Hiya. Hey. How did you know I live here? Did you follow me? Sorry about the other day. I was in a bit of a rush. Don't worry about it. Would you like to come up? Nobody's home. Okay. Let's go. How nice would it be not to have a sexuality at all? Imagine the relief of not feeling this pressure. Sometimes, a little negligence can escalate into a great evil. And the most unfair consequence of sin is that it contaminates both the perpetrators and the innocent. - Mum. - Sweetheart. Remember when I was a child and I dreamed of skewering Jesus with a pitchfork, eh? Tell me. Yes, you know. Then I woke up in a right state. And he was twitching away like a dying lizard. Uh, no, I don't remember that story, but it sounds horrible. He-hey! Can I see? These are for Mummy. Show me. How nice! For your artwork? - Yes. - Lovely. Hiya! It's us! - Ooh, hey, hey, you okay? Hey. - Ow, ow, ow. Stop, stop, stop, stop! - What is it? - Jesus! What did you do? Hey, Mum, don't worry. - Hey, we're here. - Are you okay? Yes. Stop. - Ow! - What happened? Hey, okay, okay, calm down. Calm down. It's okay. We're here. - Giaele! - What did you do? - Giaele? - Okay? Giaele? Giaele. Giaele! Giaele! What did you do? Open your mouth! Gioacchino! Gioacchino, quick! What's going on? - Spit it out! - What's going on? - What did she do? - She ate a berry. What? She ate a berry? - Spit it! - Look at me, Giaele. - Look at me. - Please, spit it out. - Call someone. Spit! - Dad! - I'm here! - Dad, run, Giaele's sick! Giaele? - Please, do something. - Giaele, darling. Shit. - Ow! - Call someone! - What's going on? - Sweetheart. Sweetheart, breathe. Breathe. Breathe. - Come on now. - Giaele. Breathe, sweetheart. - Giaele. - Sweetheart. Speak to me, sweetheart. Say something. Say something, sweetheart. Say something. Say something. Say something, sweetheart. Say something. Say something. Say something, sweetheart. Giaele. Giaele. Giaele, say something. Say something, sweetheart. Say something. Say something. Say something, sweetheart. Say something, sweetheart. Sweetheart. Say something, sweetheart. Sweetheart, no. Giaele. Oh, why her? Why her? Why her? I was here. I was here. I was here. I was... Good morning, Brother Curzio. Hey, Albinati. It went well, didn't it? You passed with distinction. Well, thanks. See you next year. I don't think so. After the death of his sister, many things changed in Gioacchino's family. I met Gioacchino again years later. He had become a psychiatrist and had treated Benazza, who had killed himself. His diagnoses of our old schoolmates were ruthless and confirmed their tendencies. Chiodi was a sadist. D'Avenia masochistic. Then he told me about Jervi. He had died. He had blown himself up while preparing a terrorist attack. What's wrong, Salvatore? Why are you looking so thoughtful? You passed. He must be in love. I'm not in love. I'm off. - Where are you going? - A party. And yes, Mum, I'll be back early. Hey! Did you not want to go to a party? Yeah. - Hurry up, will you? - I'm going now. 36 HOURS EARLIER - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Just the two of you? Yeah, Nadia couldn't make it. Even better. At least we're even. And Carlo? He had to study. Anyway, he said if we want, we can join him later at his villa. - What villa? - It's by the sea. - Well, where? - It's a beautiful place. I promise. - What do you think? - Well, I don't know. I... I can't be home late. It's not far, don't worry. From here, it'll take us an hour or so. And anyway, I have to be home for dinner. Yeah, but it's one hour there and one hour back. Then... Okay, do you want to go to the cinema? It's something different. We can watch the sunset if you want. - What do you think? - Come. - Well, okay, then. But let's not be late. - Come on. - Come on. - Don't worry. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Milady. Thanks. Hi, Leda. Is your brother here? No, no one's at home. I'm alone. Do you know when he'll be back? I wanted to congratulate him on his exam. Two years in one. No one has ever pulled that off. If you want, you can wait here. Lie down. I had often dreamt of being alone with her. And suddenly, it happened. In the end, it was a bit weird. I had this tender and ridiculous feeling which from that day has followed all my love stories, always a bit absurd and unaccomplished. But then again, maybe that's why I remember them so well. Edo. Hey. - What's that? - An invitation to a party at Circeo. That's the last time I saw Leda. - Hi. - Hi. Oh, it's him. I'll go say hi. Leda, what's happened? - Is there something I can do? - Don't you get involved. Look at you. You're a child. Carlo must have gone for a swim. Come with me. There you go. Thank you. Wait. I'll just park the car. One second. Goodness me. I've never seen a house like this before. No. Uh, hello. Good morning. May I speak to Monica? It's me. Good morning, miss. This is Dr. Edoardo Albinati's personal assistant. You know who I'm talking about? So you see, Mr. Albinati would like to invite you to a party at Circeo. He thought it would be a nice idea, since you two first met there. Please let me know if you can confirm. - But is Edoardo there? - Say yes. Go on. Yes, yes. I'll put him on now, okay? I will now forward your call to Mr. Edoardo Albinati. Hi, Monica. Who was that? Oh, it was a friend of mine. Fun. Well, at least it worked, eh? What exactly? Oh, I mean, now you and I are finally going on a date, right? Well, I'll come with my esteemed secretary. Okay, what's the plan? - Shall we come pick you up in an hour? - Yes, yes. - You sure you have your car? - Of course I do. Pik. Pik! Pik!

The way she looks at me. - The way she touches me. - Please. Don't touch me. - She only thinks you're funny. - Is that all? You sure? Oh, yeah? Is that it? Come on, Pik, please. - And then? - You're annoying. That's it. That's more than enough. Is that more than enough? Don't make fun of me. - I know there's more. Come on. - There's nothing more. - Come on, please. - Come on, take it easy, please. - What shall I do? - Don't do anything. Nothing, Pik, okay? Don't do anything. We'll see. We'll see. We'll see.

I'm sorry. That summer, we understood that we couldn't erase our mistakes, because they were embedded in our school, inside our homes. They were right under our eyes, but no one could see them. No one had the courage to talk about it. We had a mask of innocence stitched on our faces. Then one day, there suddenly ceased to be a difference between reckless kids and ferocious murderers. - It's getting late, huh? - Hmm. - Listen, sorry, when is Carlo coming? - Why? Is everything all right? Yeah, but we should be heading home soon. Yeah. For the time being, you'll stay here. Stop playing, will you? What's going on? - Move. - No. - Come with me! - Go. Come on. Come on. Move! - Don't touch me! - Just shut up! What are you going to do, huh? Ow! Ow! Ow! Get off of me! If you scream, I'll have to hit you, okay? Open up! Let us out of here, please! Please! I'm out of here. Come back soon, okay? Open the door! Open up! Please! Oh, you remember to call my parents for me. Please. Open up! Open up! - I wanna go home! I want to... - Please! I'm sorry about the other night. About my brother. I just wanted to apologise to you. I'm sorry. I got a flat tire, and I had no way to tell you. Sit down. Can I make a call? - Quickly. - Thank you. Hello, madam. Guido speaking. Listen, I wanted to tell you that Angelo asked of me to tell you that he won't be home tonight. The other entrepreneurs aren't stupid. Yes, yes, he's with Gianluca. Yes, they're going to the American flea market tomorrow morning. Thanks, bye. Although in the long run, it could turn out to be a boomerang. For the country. Well, it's the safest way to invest. Sure, interests are low, but... I know. I do know. Then tell him. Convince him. It's for our children too. It's their money too, right? Sure. What's wrong? Aren't you hungry? Where are you taking me? Donatella! No! Your turn. Up. Come. Come on! Yes. Good girl. Come on. Don't be afraid. Take your clothes off. Come on. Lose them. Perfect. Then you'll let us go? Yes, of course. We've never been home so late. What are we going to tell our parents? Hurry up. Please, take us home or they'll be worried about us. Go on. We won't say anything. All the way. No, please. I beg you. Okay, we'll sort it out, okay? Donatella. Did you hear that? - What is it? - There's a car. Hello! Please, let us out! Help, please! - Help! - Help us! I beg... - I beg of you. Please! Let us out of here! - Help! What the fuck are you doing? If you shout, I'll beat you! - Got it? - Okay! This is the shithole we locked up Bulgari. Do you think we'd let two little girls screw us? - Stop it! - Shut up! Jacques will be here soon. The boss of the Marsigliesi. He's the one who asked us to kidnap you. - This is his mansion. - Stop it! Come on, let's go. I want to go home. I want to go home. I'm fucking done with these two. I'll go get Andrea. This is Jacques. Hello. Say hi. Angelo! Don't put your hands on her like that. Right? Hey. Hi. Jacques, don't force me to sleep with you. We can't take it any more. Don't worry, hmm? I won't force you to do anything. Take us back home. Please. I beg you. We'll find a way to get you ladies back home, okay? Mm-hmm. - Okay? Hmm. - Mm-hmm. As long as you don't tell anyone about what happened here. - Mm-hmm. - Yes? - Yes? - Yeah. - Is that clear? - I promise. Good. And you? Hey. Come with me? Come on, don't be afraid. Ah. Come. Come. Let's go. No, please. No, no, no, no, don't worry. Let me go, please. No! No! What is it? It'll put you to sleep. No, no, no. Please. - No, please. - You'll make it worse for yourself. Don't move. Well, was it so difficult? These two are useless already. They've always been useless. That's not true. I don't even like them. Who, these two? This stuff doesn't work. She's not passing out. - Have you tried with a pillow? - No. I have this. What do you think? - Come on, now. - No. Hey, move! No. What are they doing to her? Do something. I'm begging you. Please. - Am I up? - Yes, you go. - Give me your arm. - Please stop. - Here we go. - Enough. Stop. Look what your friend did to me. Here and here. That's enough though. If you can't fall asleep, I'll have to take matters into my own hands. No, no more. Oh, but yes. Because you've made me lose my patience. Tell me if you prefer one of my karate moves or a blow to the back of your head with my gun. Do you prefer a karate move or a blow to the back of your head with my gun? A karate move. The karate move. The karate move. The karate move. - Hello. They're killing me. - Bitch! Can we put them in the boot? Okay. Come on, then. You have to use a blanket. This one took her time to die, huh? Andrea. I told you before not to call me that. What are we gonna do with these two? I do not know. You two deal with them. I have to take care of the villa. I'm gonna make a call. I'll ask Gianluca to ring our parents. Look, when they're sleeping, they look so good. Yes, I got it, Gianluca, but where is my son? Angelo? He said he was going to Maurizio's place. Sorry. Oh. The last minute. Yes, yes, that's fine. Thanks. Who was that? It was Gianluca, Mum. They're coming back. Everything's okay. Didn't I say so? They were pieces of meat, and they remain pieces of meat. Only with our friendship can we be saved. Only with our bond of brotherhood. To be friends of death is to be friends in death. Friends of death. Friends in death forever. To be friends of death is to be friends in death! - What time are the others coming? - In an hour. Should we get pizza? I can't. I've got to go home. Home? What do I do for an hour on my own? Fuck, Angelo. I'm going to see you later anyway, right? So we can do it when no one can see us. Okay, but what time? At three, okay? Angelo, these are the keys to the car and the keys to the gate. So you can get in without making any noise, okay? I'll see you later. Rosaria. Rosaria. They've left now. Rosaria. They've left. Rosaria. They've left. Rosaria. Wake up. Wake up, please. I beg you, Rosa. Please get up. Help. Help. I'm here. We're both here. Please help. Open up. Otherwise... otherwise, they'll return. Good evening. What's the matter? According to our records, you're the owner of a white Fiat 127. Is it stolen? No, no, it's parked nearby. - Are you the only one using it? - No, my son uses it too. Why? - And where is he now? - In his room sleeping. Sir, we have to check. Just a moment. Raffaele, what's going on? Go to bed. I confess to Almighty God and to you, my brothers and sisters, that I have greatly sinned through my thoughts and in my words in what I have done and in what I have failed to do. God Almighty, have mercy on us... After these events, some people suddenly reacted. In obedience to Christ himself... It was as if the resentment we all carried inside was looking for a way to emerge. Jesus, who came to console the sinners... I never went back to that school. The last year of high school, I left. After the murder, our quiet little neighbourhood had changed. People were suspicious in the street. No one felt safe any more. SCIENCE ENLIGHTENS THE MINDS At home, every mother scrutinised her child, trying to detect if a monster was lurking in there too. This went on for a while. Everyone began to understand that by constantly sweeping the dust under the carpet, a mountain had piled up. Then, gradually, things went back to how they were before. At the time of the Circeo massacre, rape was not considered a crime against the person but against public morality. Rosaria Lopez's death and the torture of Donatella Colasanti ignited a debate that only concluded in 1996, when sexual violence was finally considered as a crime against the person. The three perpetrators of the massacre were all given life sentences. Angelo Izzo, as soon as he was released on parole for good conduct in 2005, killed two more women. Andrea Ghira died in Morocco in 1994 after eluding arrest and having lived all his life as a fugitive. Gianni Guido, thanks to a sentence reduction, has been free since 2009. Donatella Colasanti passed away in 2005, at the age of just 47.
