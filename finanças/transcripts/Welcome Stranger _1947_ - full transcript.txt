Good morning. I'm Dr. McRory. Joseph McRory of Fallbridge. Have a chair, Doctor. Why, thank you, but I have no time to visit. I have some business with... Well, I'm sorry, Doctor, but I can't just... Oh, you may go in now. Thank you. It's a matter of great importance. Dr. McRory. From Fallbridge. How do you do, Doctor? Sit down. I believe we had some correspondence. Yes, of course we had. Oh, yes, physician to replace you. Yeah, for two months, during me vacation trip. First in 30 years. Now, I'd like a man of substance, of experience, a mature man. That's been taken care of, Doctor. Fine, fine. When can I see him? As soon as you get back to Fallbridge. He's on his way now. On his way? Me dear sir, do you suppose for a moment that I'd place the health of me town in the hands of a person I never set eyes on? What'd you suppose I came to Boston for? To buy these fishing things? I assure you we've just as good in Maine. Yes, and cheaper, too. Well, don't worry, Doctor. We only send out qualified physicians. Besides, your letter was a definite authorization. Bindin', you mean? Yes, but there's no occasion for concern, Doctor. He's a good man. Well, it's not my custom to buy a pig in a poke, but if it's binding... What's his name, this doctor? Pearson. James Pearson. Boston Times. Get your paper before the train leaves. Paper. Lower 10, sir? Yeah. Take this with you, huh? Yes, sir. Hey, paper. There you are. Hey, fella! What? That's a quarter. Well, tell 'em where you got it. Say, where's the club car on here? You can smoke in the men's washroom, sir. That's all the club car we've got. Your bag's in lower 10 and your trunks are checked through. Fine. Spread this around, will you? Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. I always like a man that whistles. Well, I guess there's room for one more here, huh, fellas? What's this? Young man! I'm sorry. In the future, you might look where you're steppin'. You're right. It's an outstanding suggestion. Board! All aboard! Young man, if you don't mind, that's my paper. What? This? If you don't mind. Well, you're welcome to any part of it, but it just happens that I'm the legal owner of this pillar of truth. You're mistaken. I bought that paper at the station. What section of it would you like? I'm offering you part of the paper. You can have the back part. You may have the front part. I'm not thankin' you because you're doin' me no favor. It's my... It's your newspaper. Yes. And I'm giving it to you. Could that be your newspaper? You got a match? Good morning, sir. Good morning. Right over here. Thank you. Oh, would you prefer to... Oh, I'm not sitting down just yet. Tell me, would it be possible to order me breakfast while I'm shavin'? You have a dish on this train I'm very partial to. Broiled brook trout with butter and lemon sauce. Oh, a very nice dish. It'll be right here for you, sir. 10 minutes? Thank you. Oh, Clarence. Yes? Broiled brook trout... I'm not sayin' that all the young people in the big cities are ill-mannered. It's a matter of breedin' and early trainin'. Now, take that young blatherskite I was tellin' ye about. The vulgar upstart. He tramples on me package and then he makes a great to-do about the ownership of a three-cent newspaper. Yes, a three-cent newspaper. Good morning. Mornin'. He must've been hard up. You mean he tried to steal your paper? Well, not exactly that. Tell you later. Breakfast is waitin'. Say, can I use your plug? Use me what? I want to use your plug. Smile right back at the sun And you'll have a wonderful day Smile right back at the sun Gloom will get out of your way Just a cheerful expression It's as easy as that And you'll go walking on a great big welcome mat Why don't you try it? Smile right back at the sun The moment he catches your eye Waking up can be fun Just depend on your friend in the sky If you start your daydreams early You're gonna get a lot more done So get up and get out and smile right back at the sun Thank you. Young man. Huh? This is a washroom, not a cabaret. No! I never knew. What did you do, cut yourself? Let me see it. No, thank you. Oh, say, Steward. Steward, do you have a single that... Broiled brook trout for you, sir? Hmm? That's very attractive. What, are you pushing trout today? Oh, no, sir. This is the very last order. Well, drop it yonder. Mmm. Yes, sir. Good morning, sir. Me order's been taken. Broiled brook trout with lemon and butter sauce. Oh, I'm sorry, sir. They told me table number five. This gentleman... I don't... I'm afraid this is your trout, sir. I'll thank you not to talk to me. Bring me another order. I'm sorry, there's no more trout, sir. No more trout? No, sir. Well, if you don't mind finishing this, I've only made a small dent in it. You may bring me some oatmeal. Oatmeal. Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir. I don't think we have any more oat... Maybe we have some more oatmeal. Maybe. I'll be pullin' for you. Want some of mine? Here's your change, sir. Waiter, bring me some pipe tobacco. Any 15 cent brand will do. We have no pipe tobacco, sir. What? No pipe tobacco? No, sir. How about cigarettes or cigars? No, no. Thanks. Thank you, sir. You bet. Oh, that's perfectly all right. Go right... Yeah, I thought it was me own pouch. Oh, of course. They do look so similar, don't they? They do not. Won't you help yourself? No, thank you. Oh, now you broke it, huh? Blatherskite! Hey, here's your hat, sir. Hillboro, Carson Junction, Lankato, Tanner City, Bentonville, Fallbridge and Callensburg. I thought you were going on a vacation. I'm leavin' Tuesday, Ben. Lot of things to tend to back home. Uh-huh. Well, get right in and we'll take off here right now. Always room for one more. Thank you. Okay. Stand away from the door. Move back in the bus, everybody. Move back a little, friend. Move back? Where am I going? Sardines have taken over back there. You all right? Oh, me bunion! Oh, I'm sorry. Service, hey, Joe? Right up to your front door. Thank you, Ben. Here's your coffee, Unc. Thank you, Jackie. Is this the main thoroughfare here? Always has been. Hi. Where do I find a taxi here? Down by the Weekly. Thank you. Down by the Weekly. Say, could you take me to Dr. McRory's house? Yup. Cost you half a dollar. Fine. Oh, is it? Sure. What's the matter? Well, when the customer likes the price, sometimes I don't. Oh, you mean you could have asked for more? Don't put words in my mouth. Get in. Say, you want to re-negotiate? Nope. Bargain's a bargain. I could've said a dollar. Not to me, you couldn't. I couldn't? No, sir. That's what I figured. Man in my business gets to know human nature. I sized you up as a half-dollar fare. You the new doc? Yeah, while McRory's away. Say, has he been here quite awhile? Thirty-five years. Oh, he's an elderly man, huh? He'll do for awhile. Is there much work here for a doctor? Population of 2,400. Well! That get-up you're wearin', is it from Boston? No, no, this is California treatment. You no like? Well... We're almost there. Mrs. Gilley. Mrs. Gilley! Yes, Doctor? What is it, Doctor? Now, are you quite sure there's been no message of any kind from this Dr. Pearson? Dr. McRory, for goodness sake. I see, I see. No message. Have I ever failed to tell you when someone called? Yes. I... The door. The door, Mrs. Gilley. The door. Here's your coat. Oh, no. Keep the change. Charged a half dollar, keep a half dollar. No extras. May I tell you something? What? You'd be a big hit in New York. How do you do? I'm Dr. Pearson. Come in. Thank you. Take the bag to the back room, Mr. Dorkas. I know. Put your coat down. Are you Mrs. McRory? Heaven forbid! It's enough that I do his cooking and tidying up. I'll tell him. He's here, Doctor. What's that? I say he's here. Dr. Pearson? Yes. Fine, fine, bring him in. Come in, Doctor. Welcome, Doc... Yup. No. It's not possible. Well, it's me. I can't believe it. Me, neither. 180,000 physicians in the country and... You got me. You know, Doctor, actually, it was my newspaper, you know. Young man, do you try to be objectionable? I'm not trying. I can tell you this. If I'd seen you in Boston, I wouldn't be seein' you now. What's this you're wearin'? What are you dressed up for? Oh, you like my outfit. Not too loud? Let me look at your credentials. Got 'em right here. I know of no Drake Hospital in Boston. Oh, the Drake isn't a hospital, Doctor. It's a hotel. You worked in a hotel? Hmm-mmm. I wasn't hopping bells, either. I was house physician. Three months. Were you fired? No, I took a job as ship's doctor on the New York to Bermuda run. Five voyages. What's this here about Valpar... What's that name? Oh, it's Valparaiso. That's down in Chile. I did a little hospital work down there. Yeah, you were there three months, huh? Hmm-mmm. I see you did a little better in Goose Liver, Wyoming. No, that's Goose River, Doctor. Ah, yeah, you were there almost four months. Just about. I was personal physician to a wealthy rancher, till he died. Died, huh? Well, that couldn't have surprised the poor man. Pearson, as a doctor who has been working in the one community for 35 years, I find this extremely painful. I was hoping to get a good man. A man of substance, a man who might perhaps stay on and assist me in the new hospital, but... Oh, I couldn't handle that, Doctor. I'm leaving in a couple of months for Guatemala. Got my passage booked. Well, fine. You wouldn't think of going even sooner, huh? Right now? No. You have nothing to worry about, Doctor. I'm really an able physician. To be honest, I wouldn't trust you with me dog. I find nothing to recommend you. Even your accent, the way you speak, it's... It's disturbin' to New England ears. Where did you acquire your Yankee accent? Don't change the subject. I suppose you have the agreement, the letter I signed? Yeah, sure. And you regard it as bindin'? Of course. Oh. Well, Mrs. Gilley will show you to your room. Mrs. Gilley. Mrs. Gilley. Yes, Doctor. Pay no mind to the old fellow. He can be as ornery as a hawk in a henhouse. But he's a good man. Well, he'll be leaving soon. Yoo-hoo! Oh. Come in. Oh, Trudy. Well, it's finished, Doctor. Me sweater? Hmm-mmm. For the trip. One fitting and we can put the front and back together. Take your coat off and turn around. I see the new doctor's here. Yes. Trudy, you're a person I can talk to. Hmm? I want to tell you about that young man. All right. Who? Oh, she came in there a minute ago. Don't put that satchel on my clean quilt. Oh, I'm sorry. She had sort of a checkered ribbon in her hair. Oh, that's Trudy Mason. She's the schoolteacher. Schoolteacher! I never had schoolteachers look like that when I went to school. I may go back and brush up on my spelling. Well, are you sure he's incompetent? I know he's incompetent. The man's not a doctor, he's a hobo. He's never been in one place for more than three months. And he's arrogant about it. Oh! He sounds dreadful. He is dreadful. Well, then get somebody else. No, I made an agreement. I'm bound in honor. Besides, he has it in writing. Oh, dear. What's wrong? I'm afraid it isn't a very good fit. Oh, I'm sure it's grand. No, I did the thing too fast. Why don't you pay him off, Doctor? Well, that's me intention. But if I do, I can't get away for a vacation. Oh, well, that's out of the question. You need a vacation and you're going to have one. Oh, it's awful! Oh, it isn't awful. No, no, that's grand. It's roomy. You know, I like a sweater roomy. Come in. Say, Doctor, did I leave my... Well? Well, I was going to pretend that I came in here on business, but... But what? Oh, that's nice. That's very attractive. Hmm. What is it? Secret? It's very obviously a sweater. Just one? I'm afraid it does look more like a woolen nightgown. Well, woolen nightgowns are here to stay, don't you think? I don't think I've met Miss Mason, Doctor. No, I don't believe you have. Miss Mason, Dr. Pearson. Delighted to meet you. How do you do? You're the teacher here, huh? I'll talk to you later, Doctor. I'm being dismissed. Doctor... No, you are right. I have been a bad boy. I sang in the washroom and I ate Dr. McRory's fish. Really? Now, that'll be just about enough, young man. I'm gone. I'm gone. I'm gone. See? That's what they call doctors nowadays. Dr. Pearson. Yeah, huh? I may have seemed rude. No. Well, I didn't intend to be. Let's sit down some place, shall we? Nothing I'd like better. In the parlor? Good idea. The sofa? Uh, no, this chair is fine. I'm sort of partial to sofas. We didn't have any in the Army, you know. Fortunately, we won the war, anyway. So we did. I understand you've done a lot of traveling. Quite a lot. Don't you think, Doctor, after all the things you've done, Fallbridge is going to be very dull? You don't like me, do you? I hadn't thought much about it. Do most people? Like me? Oh, a fair percentage. I don't cheat at cards, pay my bills and I never kicked a big dog in my entire life. It's very quiet in Fallbridge. Very restful, too. And it's going to be awfully cold soon. It's a little chilly here right now. What I mean, Doctor, is you're obviously a big city man, and this is a small place and I honestly think Dr. McRory would release you, if you wanted to leave. Oh, you do, huh? Yes. Look, Teacher, school is out. I'm on my own now. And I think it would be nice if I went around making my own decisions. Of course. Thanks, Teach. A little hot coffee, Doctor? Yes, please. Dr. Pearson? No, thanks. Come in. Hiya. Oh, Doc. What's it, Nat? Oh, good evenin'. Morton Elkins over at his barn, up in the haymow, fell and hurt his leg. Bad? Not good. Want me to run over there, Doctor? No, thank you. I can manage. I'll get me bag. Say, Mrs. Gilley. Yes? They have a movie in this town? Yes, they do. Good. But not tonight. Picture show's on Tuesday. What's showing Tuesday? Some picture with Bob Hope in lt. I'll wait till a week from Tuesday. Doctor. Yeah. You come along with me tonight. With you? You'll have a real nice time. What are we going to do, hit the hot spots? Just as soon as I get the dishes finished up. Let me help you. Give me a towel there and we'll get goin'. How could a grown man fall from a hayloft? He slipped. Mort Elkins, you clumsy fool. Where are you? There's no one here. What did you expect, a brass band? A brass band. Now, what kind of a ridiculous... Say, what's all this? Is Morton hurt? He's over there, Doc. Oh, sure. Sure. Over here, Doc. Here I am. Oh, it hurts bad, too, Doc. See, can't hardly do this anymore. Mort, you old scalawag, ya! Here, you can set his leg. Wait till I get this through me head. Come on, Doctor. Have some punch or cider. Great to see you, Doc. Have a good time, Doc. This is very embarrassing, Trudy. Embarrassing? A farewell party and I'm not going away. Oh, but you are going away. But I can't. Well, why not? Attention, everybody, attention. Up here, Doc. And Trudy. Oh, of course. You, too, Trudy. We've got to have Maine's prettiest schoolmarm on the platform. Well, here we are. Sit down, everybody. Sit down. Let's have it quiet, please. We have here in Fallbridge the biggest little chamber of commerce in Maine. And I'm going to call on its president, your friend and pharmacist, and my son, Mr. Roy Chesley. Thank you, Mr. Chesley. Ladies and gentlemen, I dare say that when more than half of you first came into the world, and first opened your eyes, the first man you saw was our guest of honor. A man who has served this community and served it well. You're looking very nice this evening, Mrs. Gilley. Thanks. Place we're going ain't no hot spot. It ain't? You shouldn't say "ain't," Doctor. You say it. I live here. When you say it, it sounds like you're making fun of us. Oh, I wouldn't do that. Not for the world, 'cause I like you. Well, you won't be so bad yourself once you learn not to talk all the time. Now, a word from Trudy Mason. Oh, Trudy. Dr. McRory, your friends, and that means all of us here in Fallbridge, want you to have this for your trip, with all our love. Well, uh, thanks. Open the bag. Look inside, Doc. Look inside. Go ahead. Look inside. What in the world is this? It's your new hospital, Doctor. That's right. Ain't that a neat little model? Mort did a good job of it. The excavating starts next week. That's right. And we've got every dime raised, Doc. Well, well. You're good people, all of you. Uh, and... As on this date, all outstandin' bills due to me are cancelled. Every penny. I don't think I've felt like this since I was a little kid on Christmas mornin'. Good evening, Mrs. Gilley. Good evening. That's all. Who's he? Evening, Mrs. Gilley. Good evening. Good evening, Abbie. Good evening. Hello. Good evening. Dr. Pearson, this is Roy Chesley. How do you do? Glad to meet you. Well, thank you. And his father, Mr. C.J. Chesley. How do you do, sir? Pearson, Trudy and I were discussing you. Why, that's very flattering. I'm president of the Fallbridge Chamber of Commerce... Oh, really? Say, would you hold this a minute? Miss Mason and I have this dance. Oh, uh... Well... Uh-huh. Doc, Trudy told me about your problem with that fellow. Let me handle him. No, no. There's a friend of mine in Augusta. Dr. Jenks. He's a fine MD. He can be here Friday. Well, looks good enough to eat. Really heartwarming, this New England hospitality, isn't it? All these nice, friendly faces. Fella down at the board of education was telling me of a new ruling they have there. Guess he must have been wrong. What ruling? They told me it was okay now for schoolteachers to smile. Oh, yes, he must have been wrong. Well, I heard that... Well, I must have been wrong, too. Could be. What have you heard? Oh, the impression I had that doctors always had good manners. May I? Of course. Dr. Pearson. Hmm. I'm Bill Walters. Yeah? Editor, reporter, copy boy of the town's leading and only newspaper. So? I'm drunk. That was my diagnosis. I wanna give you a little advice. Get drunk. The town's more charming that way. Well, I'll sleep on it. Folks. Attention. Attention, please. I've got some disappointing news. No square dances tonight. I'm sorry, but Jeff Hawkins just phoned from Bentonville. He has to work tonight and he can't be here to do the call. It's my big chance. Oh, Mr. Chesley. Yes? I learned a little bit about these barn dances when I was out in Wyoming. Do you mind if I try? Get your partners for a square dance, huh? Say, do you fellas know Country Style? Yeah, we do, but... Young man, we are perfectly capable of managing our own affairs. And we don't have any square dances without Jeff Hawkins. Well, it's a shame he isn't here. Then we could have done a very nice duet. Contact. All set? Well, you pull up your pants You tighten your traces You all join hands You're off to the races Break your holds and you backtrack back Promenade, single file Ladies in the lead that Indian style And swing that gal behind you Cut across and swing Grandpa He ain't been swung since last fall Ladies start a-center Gents on a little side bet Meet your partner You ain't through yet It's four hands 'round with the couple you met Four hands up and around you go And when you get straight it's a do-see-do Chicken in the bread pan picking out the dough Grab your partners A- home you go Ladies to the center Back to the bar Gents to the center You form a star Pick your partner, promenade Around the track Don't stay in the shade Gents swing out and the ladies swing in They cross their hands and you're off again Ladies swing out and you all eight swing Now you're back home in the same old ring First and third, you balance and swing Down the center Divide the ring Ladies go east and the gents go west Meet in line Four abreast Forward eight and fall back eight Forward again with a right and a left Cross the hall and you pass them all And take that very pretty gal with you Meet your partner Promenade eight Round the old track till you come out straight First and third You balance and swing You lead right out to the right of the ring You right and left through and a right and left back Promenade all around the track When it comes to fancy dancin' Or to music with a smile Or to nice romancin' Make mine country style When it comes to hands that hold ya Eyes that shine about a mile Like I just now told ya Make mine country style Hear that fiddle I could listen all night Hear that banjo Ain't that somethin'?

Number four, fellas. Pardon me. Huh? No, Trudy, it's Pearson I want. Well, no, I think I prefer to dance with Miss Mason. She's prettier. Hello, Trudy. You'll pardon me? Yeah. Pearson, you're not going to win any popularity contests in Fallbridge. I haven't entered any. You know, I learned how to handle fellows like you in the Army. I was a captain. Well, I learned how to handle captains. I was a major. Let me give you some advice. Are you a lawyer? No, I'm a pharmacist. Well, I might send you some of my prescription business. Oh, say, some day I wish you'd show me how to make a good banana split. I do love banana splits. Pardon me. Cutting in seems to be your specialty, Doctor. Oh, no, I'm a general practitioner. Do you generally go around making friends this way? I'd rather concentrate on just making one friend. I like blue eyes. Am I supposed to say, "Thank you, Doctor. I'm glad you like blue eyes"? Well, you could say that. But I'd just as soon you looked up and gave me a nice smile. I like your smile, too. Is that the shipboard approach or the bedside manner? Teacher. You know, I can't really figure out which of the Chesleys I dislike more. Roy or his father. Oh? I guess Roy, though. I guess he's a little more obnoxious, don't you think? Dr. Pearson. What? Roy and I are going to be married. Thanks for the dance. Seems downright stubborn, you goin' away so sudden-like. I did plan to stay a little longer. You haven't told the Doctor? I haven't seen him, but he'll be delighted. Old fool! I'm driving you to the bus. You are? In Andy Weaver's pickup truck. And we can take this with us, too. There's no sense in your wasting your money on that Dorkas. I'll appreciate that, Mrs. Gilley. I'll take your horse blanket. Just about the shortest engagement I ever had. Make mine city style Oh, my achin' back. Aren't we going the wrong way? No. Before leaving, you'll want to see the Doctor. Oh. There he is. Why, that old phony. Didn't he tell you he had an urgent pneumonia case? He did. How'd you know he was here, then? Fishing poles and boots don't cure pneumonia. Take your time, Doctor. The bus don't leave till 4:00. I'll be back. Hey! How's Mrs. Hickey comin' along? Huh? How's Mrs. Hickey doin'? Oh, her pneumonia is better. Much better. Oh, glad to hear that. Young man, are you spying on me? No, I've just come to tell you I was leaving. Are you now? Well... Ah, yes. You'll not be leaving for a couple of weeks? Next bus. Pearson, I'm an honest man. I'll not pretend I'm going to miss you. But I'd be greatly obliged if you'd stay on for a fortnight when I have a good doctor coming. Oh, that is, this man Jenks is most highly recommended. Roy Chesley says he... I thought you told me you wouldn't hire a man again without seeing him first. Well, yes, I did. But this could be nothin' but an improvement. Improvement? Why don't we start the improvement right now, then. Goodbye, Doctor. Pearson! What? Be reasonable. I want to start me trip on Friday. No. Now, I'm not asking you to handle any difficult cases. If anything serious comes up before Jenks arrives, Wheaton will come over from Bentonville. No. Next bus. Goodbye. I'll give you a cash bonus if you stay. Say $10... Say $5. You said $10. Did I? Yeah. All right, Doctor, $10. No, Doctor. The town doesn't like me and I don't like the town. I better get out today. You'll never catch anything with that routine, either. I've been fishin' here for 35 years. Have you now? Then maybe it's time you had a few suggestions. Do you mind? So you're a fisherman, too? Well, I ought to be a standout in this league. Let me see this equipment you got here. What are you doing with this big buoy on? My heavens! I like to get the hook down into the fish's living room. Down deep. Down where the money is. Let's see. Get it way out there, deep. There we are. Stand by for action. Well, that's interesting. Very interesting. You'll stay for a couple of weeks, eh? No. My heart is a hobo Loves to roam through fields of clover Are you deliberately trying to scare away the fish? On the contrary. Best audience I ever had was an eight pound trout. How he loved boogie-woogie. My heart is a hobo Loves to roam through fields of clover Hates to have to think things over And though it's wrong I string along My heart is a hobo Loves to go out berry-picking Hates to hear alarm clocks ticking It isn't smart But that's my heart When hopes are out at the elbows And dreams are run down at the heels My heart refuses to worry Except about rods and reels My heart is a hobo Loves to quote from Omar Khayyam Hates the stodgy guy that I am And though it's strange I just can't change my heart Doc! Bill Walters is in bad shape. I just took him home. What's it? Whiskey? No. One of his bustin' headaches. Tell him to take two of the capsules I gave him. Well... Is that the newspaper fellow? Yeah. What causes the headaches? Wish I knew. Don't you think he ought to be seen? Be examined? Examination shows nothing. I've had him in me office a dozen times. I think I'll run over and take a look at him. Here. You? Yeah. Doctor. I don't think I could stay for a fortnight, but I'll tell you what I'll do. What? I'll stay a couple of weeks. Coming right with you, Nat. Used up about 20 cents worth of gas gettin' out here. Well, I'll take your temperature sometime. On the house. My heart is a hobo Loves to roam through fields of clover Doctor, Nat's still waiting for you. Well, tell him to go ahead. I'll walk home. Come on in, Emily. Did you find out what's wrong with him, Doctor? No, I'm afraid not. I'd like to have been here during the attack. Blood pressure's a little high, but that shouldn't do it. A dozen doctors have told me that. Pretty interesting case, huh? I'd like to speak to your father alone, Emily, huh? Yes, sir. Want a drink? No, thanks. Would you guess, Doctor, that the present editor of the Fallbridge Weekly once won a Pulitzer Prize? Well, I did, back in Boston. Were you drinking better whiskey then? I wasn't drinking then. Whiskey isn't why I'm here. The reason I'm here is because you can't work on a daily paper and have your head splitting wide open half the time. I might be able to find out something about those headaches if I could examine you some day when you're not drinking. Why don't you lay off for, well, till Friday? I could say I would, but a drunk's promise isn't worth very much. That's a mighty sweet kid you have there. Yeah. Pretty busy girl, huh? Mmm-hmm. Oh, Doctor. Yes. Do you think you can help him? Well, I'm going to try, Emily. Oh, please do. I'm not sure, but I have a hunch your father isn't going to drink for awhile. Well, I don't know. Don't you go to school, Emily? When Papa's well, I do. Doctor, we won't be able to pay you for a while. Well, that's all right. You can pay me when you've married some big billionaire lumberman. With 4% interest. I'm going to marry a newspaper man. We'll waive the interest. Emily! Oh. I'll have to put off making any resolutions till tomorrow, Doctor. I just found another bottle. I'd better... I'd better fix his supper. And your ticket, you haven't forgotten your ticket? You asked me that twice, Mrs. Gilley. It's in me wallet. I think. And your woolen muffler? Yes, in me wallet. Where the blue blazes is Pearson? No occasion for profanity, Doctor. All right, all right, all right. Now, bear in mind, anything important, telephone Dr. Wheaton in Bentonville. Yes, you told that to Dr. Pearson. Oh, that Pearson! Now, he knows I'm leaving. Oh, it's you, Nat. Will you take these out, Mr. Dorkas? Nice bag. Makes the others look terrible. You didn't see Pearson? No. And don't forget these, Mr. Dorkas. I only got two hands, Mrs. Gilley. Well, I'll wait two minutes longer. Doctor! Huh? Emily! Good afternoon. What's your hurry? Well, I just saw you and I thought I'd get home before it started raining. I see. How's your dad? He's fine. He hasn't been... He's fine. Good. He has confidence in you, Doctor. I have, too. Oh, I'm glad about that. Doctor. Huh? I must have sounded awfully vain when I told you I was going to marry a newspaperman. But still, men do marry girls who aren't pretty, don't they? Well, you have nothing to worry about. A gal with your good looks. Doctor. Hmm? If I asked you a question, I mean casually, not like a visit, well, would there be a fee? Well, it depends upon how casually you ask the question. You see, I was wondering... I saw in a newspaper advertisement that if you send in a dollar, well, they send you back something for freckles. Freckles? Do you think you need any more? Oh, I mean to get rid of 'em. Oh, you must be kidding. But I'm not. Well, it's a good thing you came to me then, because I want to straighten you out on something. Don't you know that in New York, Paris and Hollywood, too, women are not considered smart unless they have freckles. Those glamour girls, they sit around in the sun all day just trying to pick up a few. They do? You've read about Cleopatra, haven't you? Yes. And her freckles? Did she have freckles? Why, they used to call her Speck. Thank you, Doctor. I don't believe a word you said, but thank you. So long, Cleo. Well, Nat, what's the latest scuttle on the weather? See it bankin' up over there? Yeah, got it. Be comin' down soon. That's your considered opinion, huh? Yeah. The young blatherskite. He knows I'm leavin'. Now, now, now. Don't get yourself overheated. Here's your umbrella. You haven't been feelin' too well. And how could I feel well? Haven't you left yet, Doctor? And how could I leave without giving you instructions? I thought I had my instructions. If anybody gets sick, I'm to call Dr. Wheaton. Young man, I can do without the sarcasm. Now, Wheaton will come over for serious cases. Okay. You stay here till Jenks arrives. Right. See that Mrs. Sims takes calcium tablets for her chilblains. Calcium tablets. Yeah. And give Miss Lennek some sugar pills. Sugar pills? Yeah, yeah, yeah. She thinks she's ill. Oh, I get it. Yeah, and Mat Tewson's carbuncle's about ready for lancing. All right. Yes. And you might drop in on Mrs. Krelly. Her baby is about due. Doctor, do you think I'm quite capable of delivering a baby? Frankly, no. But I'm not worrying about Mrs. Krelly. She's had 10. She'll tell you what to do. It's starting to rain. Oh, all right. I have me umbrella. Well, goodbye, Mrs. Gilley. Well, I'm... Nat's gonna drop me off at the Ladies' Aide. So long, Doctor. Hope you have good fishing. Goodbye. Now, remember, no surgeries. No surgeries. Miss Lennek's sugar pills. Mrs. Sims gets some calcium tablets. Mat Tewson's carbuncle's about ready to pluck. Oh, Doctor, I'll run back and get you a little baking soda. You will not. Get in there. Everyone thinks he's a doctor around here. Drive on at once! My heart is a hobo Loves to roam through fields of clover Hates to have to think things over And though it's wrong I string along My heart is a hobo Loves to go out berry-picking Hates to hear alarm clocks... Hello. Oh, hello. I've missed him, haven't I? Dr. McRory? Yeah, a few minutes ago. My car wouldn't start. You couldn't lend me an umbrella, could you? Well, ordinarily, there's a small charge for that service, but in your case, we'll waive it. Help yourself. Thank you. Don't let it get around, huh? No, I won't. Oh, say, Teach, I have some good news for you. You have? Mmm-hmm. I'll be leaving soon. Well, I'm sorry there won't be time for a civic celebration, but I'm sure the town is grateful. Oh, you know, those are the first kind words I've heard in Fallbridge. My heart is a hobo Loves to quote from Omar Khayyam Hates the stodgy guy that I am And though it's strange I just can't change my heart Dr. Pearson! Dr. Pearson! Open up! Open up! What's the matter? What happened? Well, we get to the bus and he seemed to be fine. Pain in me stomach. Let's get this wet coat off. We no more than shake hands, he keeled over, like he was kicked by a mule. Help me carry him in the office. No, no. I can walk. I'll help you. What is it? I don't know. Will you wait here? Pearson, call Dr. Wheaton. He's sick. Mighty sick. What's wrong? I ain't no doctor and I don't think Pearson is neither. Well, call me if you need me. Call Dr. Wheaton. We will, Doctor. Oh, me appendix. Probably have to come out. Trudy! Pearson, I wish you'd let me alone. Take it easy, Doctor. Now, you've had your finger jabbed before. Certainly. I don't mind a little thing like that. You don't have to jab me so deep. One, two, three, four, five. What's the blood count? Wait a minute. Nine lymps, two monocytes, 16,000 whites, 89% polys. Oh, Trudy, call Dr. Wheaton. Bentonville 1-4-8. 1-4 what? Bentonville 1-4-8. Bentonville 1-4... Look, please get off the line. This is an emergency call. Dr. McRory's office. It's that chatterbox, Mrs. Higgins, I suppose. Thank you. Operator? Bentonville 1-4-8. Was it Mrs. Higgins? Mrs. Sims. That one is just as bad. I don't think I'd put off the operation, Doctor. Nice vacation! Hello. Is Dr. Wheaton there? Oh. He's gone to Elktown on a confinement case. He won't be back until 10:00. We can't wait, Doctor. Can't? We must wait. I'd take you to the Bentonville hospital myself. But it's a long trip in the rain and the roads are rough. I'd better operate here. You? Pearson, I may be a very sick man but me mind is perfectly clear. I'd as soon call in Sweeney The Butcher. Let's be sensible, Doctor. I know that you don't have any confidence in me, but there isn't any other choice. Your pulse is 108. Trudy, call Dr. Blodgett of Millbrook. Is this Millbrook near here? Over 90 miles. Look, Doctor... No. You speak to him, Miss Mason. You know what a perforated appendix can do. The danger of peritonitis. Dr. McRory, please. It has to be done, Doctor, and immediately. Pearson, I warn you, if you operate against me will, you'll go to prison for manslaughter. Doctor, you've had a lot more experience than I have. Now, what would you do with a patient as ornery, as cranky and as downright disagreeable as you are? Now, that's not a fair question. Come on, Doctor, we'll get you ready for the operation. No, no. Pearson, have you operated before? Certainly. Well... Miss Mason, you're going to help me. What? Mmm-hmm. Well, all right. Come on, Doctor. Well, I've had a good life. Me fishin' tackle goes to Mort Elkins, a true friend. Andy Weaver is to have me pipes. Doctor. No, no, write it down as I tell you, Trudy. Mrs. Gilley... I'm sorry, Doctor, but Miss Mason will have to give up her legal work. I need a nurse. Me house goes to Mrs. Gilley and me war bonds and savings go to you, Trudy, and to little Emily Walters. Pearson, you're a witness. Come on, you'll be up playing football in three weeks. No. I know. Even with a good surgeon, 10% of peritonitis cases are lost. Well, then you needn't worry. I've already lost my 10%. What are you doin' there? Put that away! I'll take no ether. I want a local anesthetic, Pearson. Now, be reasonable, Doctor. I'd like to give you a spinal if I had somebody to watch your blood pressure. And who said anything about a spinal? I said a local. Oh, Doctor! Believe me, Pearson, you'll be grateful for my supervision. I've had a lot of experience. Well, I've told you this isn't my first operation. A local, please. All right. Trudy, you see that over there? Get it. What? The mirror. The mirror? Yes, the mirror. Yes. Here? Yes. Do you know how to locate the appendix? Yes, I do. What kind of incision are you planning? A McBurney. No, no. Make a lateral. Give you more exposure. And the sutures, you're using catgut? Silk. Oh, no, I don't hold with silk. Use catgut. Doctor, maybe you better do it yourself. And how can I do it meself? If you can't, then let me. Your instructions clear? I... I think so. Well, Doctor, remember, no movement. Trudy, move your head a little. I can't see into the mirror. Maybe it's as well we didn't wait. Is it over? It's over. Is he all right? He's asleep. Oh, thank heavens. You did a fine job, Miss Mason. Thank you. Doctor! Doctor! Mrs. Gilley! Hello, Doctor. Good morning. Hi, Doc. Howdy, Dr. Pearson. Hello, boys. How's the old doc? Oh, he looks better than I do. Say, I hear you saved his life. He sure did. I had to. He owed me a week's salary. He's a joker. Did a good job, eh? Oh, Dr. Pearson! Hello, Miss Lennek. Going on the sleigh ride this evening? It's our annual. Oh, I wish I could. Dr. Pearson! Nurse Mason. Hello, Chesley. Hello. What will it be? I'd like a couple of dozen phenobarbital tablets. Half gram. Jed Conway's account. Well... That's a hypertension case. Yes, that's right. We have some potassium thiocyanate. I believe it's considered more modern. Would you be terribly offended if I insisted upon phenobarbital? No, just as you say. Thanks. Say, Nurse, I'm taking out some tonsils tomorrow. Would you like to join me? Are you doing it with mirrors? That was quite the experience, wasn't it? I had one disappointment. What's the matter? I had the impression you always sang during surgery. Well, it was sort of unexpected. Forgot my music. But, you know, I don't think you realize just how wonderful you were. I've had experienced nurses who weren't nearly so helpful. Well, you were a help, Doctor. Really? I don't think I could have saved Dr. McRory alone. Oh, you... Of course, Dr. Pearson knows that an appendectomy is probably the simplest of all operations. Roy! No, he's right. Oh, I don't mean to belittle Dr. Pearson, Trudy. But you do know that appendix operations are often performed even by pharmacists. Still? Well, on shipboard. In the movies, too. Well, thank you. Oh, Doctor... Yeah. I don't suppose you'd care to go along on the sleigh ride. I imagine Dr. Pearson is too busy. Well, I am, yes. But you'll have a lot of fun, I know. Bye, Nurse. Goodbye, Doctor. Hello. Hello, Emily. Oh, hello, Doctor. Ronnie! It's Ronnie Jenks. Why, certainly I'll pick you up. In person. You wait for me at the Elktown station. The new doctor? Yes, he's Butch Jenks' brother. I've told you about Butch Jenks. Well, this kid is just like him. Well, if you're going to Elktown, won't we miss the sleigh ride? No, you go right ahead. I'll meet the sleigh in Bentonville. At the church supper. And we'll have the ride back together. How's your father? Fine. He's only had one attack and he's still drinking tea. Good. I'll examine him again before I leave. But, Doctor... Yeah. Is it unethical for a doctor to take a girl with him on his calls? No. I wouldn't think so. Come along. Thank you. I'd love to. Of course I don't blame you for going away. You are, huh? Mmm-hmm. As soon as Dr. Jenks gets here. I guess for people like us, Fallbridge is awful slow. Awfully. Doctor. Yeah. If I asked you a very frank question, well, would you give me a frank answer? I'll try, Emily. Well, did you really mean it when you said that you thought I was pretty? Indeed I did. Thank you. You're quite welcome. And, Doctor. Mmm? Has it ever occurred to you that in five years, I'll be practically 18? No, no, it hadn't, but five years and practically 13 is practically 18. That's simple arithmetic. And besides, in some parts of the world, not that I approve of it, of course, but girls often get married when they're 10. Emily Walters. You're an old maid. Well? Looks like it froze up. Must be out of alcohol. Do you have any? Well, I got to thaw it out first. I'll have it over at Doc's house first thing in the morning. Well, how are we going to get home? Well, if Molly wasn't sick, she could drive you in. Well, Mr. Pinkett, your wife's going to be all right. But you've been letting her work a little too hard. Here's my prescription. One hired girl. Mmm-hmm, that's what she needs. A couple of days rest in bed. That'll be $2. Doc McRory would rather have Mrs. Pinkett's pickles than cash. Well, there's this to be considered. A man with some pickles laid by ain't likely to lose them on the horses, is he? You'll enjoy them, Doc. Look, Doctor! Hello! Howdy, Nat. How about giving us a lift? Howdy, Doc! Sure. If you're heading for Bentonville. Sleigh ride's a dollar. Church supper is extra. Come on along. Yes, why don't you? If you haven't any calls to make. Come on, Doc! Sure, come on! Well, calls are all finished. What do you say, Emily? Gee, yes! You've got a date. Get aboard. Come on then. Say, Mr. Pinkett, would you call Mrs. Gilley and tell her that I can be reached through the Bentonville operator? And tell Bill Walters that Emily's with me. Say, Doc. Huh? Fixing cars is a business with me. That'll cost you $2. Certainly. Are you done? Hey, Trudy, have an apple. Keep the doctor away. Save the apple for Roy. Nice going, fellas. They are very rude, but she is engaged. I know. Where is Roy? He's meeting the new doctor, Ronnie Jenks. Oh. Sorry you're leaving. Me, too. I imagine a girl who isn't engaged is even sorrier when someone is leaving. Don't you think so, Miss Mason? Yes, I do. Are you warm enough, Emily? Uh-huh, except for a little draft. Oh, well, let's fix it. There we are. There. Thank you. Better? Uh-huh. Are you all right? Oh, fine, thank you. How is Roy, Miss Mason? He's fine. Say, all this kidding and everything, Roy isn't apt to take it seriously, is he? Roy? Oh, no. Hmm-mmm. You don't really know Roy, Doctor. He's very understanding. He knows that you and I are... Yes, we are. Here we are. Mind you, Ronnie, he's not young. And I won't say his methods are very modern. It's precisely why I'm here. The more old-fashioned he is, the sooner I'll get to be number one boy. Oh, Mr. Chesley, come in. Thank you. How are you feeling, Mrs. Gilley? Oh, well enough, I guess. This is a quaint old place. Mrs. Gilley, will you please tell Dr. McRory that Dr. Jenks is here? Dr. Jenks? Yes. This way. Doctor! Will the masked rider get there in time to save Annie from Black Horse Baskin? Listen in tomorrow, same time, same station... ... when crispy, crackly, creamy crusties presents another... Doctor... Hello. Hello, Dr. McRory. Glad to see you, Roy. This is my very good friend, Dr. Jenks. Jenks? How are you, Doctor? I'm satisfactory, thank you. Everything is set. Jenks is moving into that little cottage Dad owns across the street. And he's ready to take over. Take over? Take over what? Well, your practice, Doctor, as I understand it, until you... Young man, I hope you haven't traveled very far because I have no opening for you. Huh? But, Dr. McRory, you asked him to come here. Oh, no, Roy, you asked him. I'm very sorry, but I have the most excellent man with me now. And I see no reason for a change. Thank you. Now, wait a minute, Doctor. You made it quite clear that you consider Pearson just as I do. An incompetent, arrogant, vaudeville singer, not a doctor. Now, you needn't distort the facts, Roy. Dr. Pearson's a man of great ability. Which I... Yes, I was the very first to recognize. And he's a fine surgeon. And as for objection to a doctor singing, well, now, what sort of narrow-minded nonsense is that? I'm surprised at you, Roy. Well, I guess there's nothing more to say. Yes, there's one thing more. I'll thank you not to use me to get your friends employment. And now, if you don't mind, I'll be taking me rest. I don't want to be disturbed. Yes, you should. I won't forget this, Doctor. See that you don't. Goodbye. Is Dr. Pearson really staying on? Why wouldn't he be staying on? The position of assistant director and chief surgeon in the most modern hospital in all of Maine... Did he... Did he say he was staying? Mrs. Gilley, I'm not a well man. All this chitter, chitter, chatter is most disturbing. Turn on me radio, please. It's funny, Roy's not showing up, hmm? Yes. Lovely night. Beautiful. As long as I'm dreaming How nice it can be How nice to have you In love with me Did you know that you just kissed me? What a thrill I got As long as I'm dreaming My love If I were just wishing What good would it do What chance would I have To wish for you If you never know I love you Still it works out fine As long as I'm dreaming You're mine As long as I'm dreaming You're mine The doctor is as good as Frank Sinatra. Yes, and I can take your blood pressure at the same time. Oh! Oh, well. Don't worry about Emily, Doctor. I'll get her home. Thank you, Miss Lennek. Good night, everybody. Good night. Good night, Miss Mason. Good night, Doctor. Trudy, Trudy. Yes? Roy Chesley has been telephoning. He wants you to call him right away. All right, I'll take it from here. Good night, Nat. Hello, Doctor. Back in bed again, huh? Did you get a little tired? Ah, no, I'm all right. Well, I hear you were on the sleigh ride. Yeah. Had a good time? Oh, wonderful. Trudy was there? Yeah. Without Roy? Mmm-hmm. Well, what do you think of that? Ah, there's a fine girl, Trudy. Great pity she's throwing herself away on that rag, Roy Chesley. Don't you think? He's a pretty stuffy fellow. Pulse is good. Yeah, Trudy, Trudy... She tells me that Dr. Jenks has arrived, huh? Oh, that blatherskite. Most incompetent young man. And so rude. He went away. Huh? Wait a minute, here. I'm leaving, you know, as soon as you're well. Oh, I have another doctor coming. Yes, yes. Who? A Dr. Gilrooney. What's his first name? What's that? First name? Oh, Peter. A very nice young man. But far from your acumen, boy. Well, naturally. Yes, of course. If you change your mind... No. Anyway you'll be up and around in a week or so. You'll be back on the job all by yourself. All by myself. How those words describe me whole life. I'd like you to see something, Doctor. Lovely young lady, isn't she? Oh, she's lovely, yeah. I was very fond of her, very fond. And she of me. What happened? Oh, you know, just a young doctor just starting, not too bright. Yeah. While I was making up me mind, she married. And now, I'm a lonely old man. Don't make the mistake I made, me son, or you'll be lonely, too. Trudy has a very high opinion of you. Doctor, I'm leaving at the end of the week. Oh, don't think for a moment that I intended to say that... Close, please. I was... Close. Please. Oh, listen to me. We waited for you there. I know. I know. I saw you waiting, both of you. I drive all the way to Bentonville and... Oh, I'm sorry you're upset. Honestly, I am. Well, where can I see you later? Oh, at my place in half an hour. At the boarding house in half an hour. Goodbye. Right on the line. Could have told you that before you took it. Hello, Doctor. How's our patient? Oh, he's himself again. Health, fine. Disposition, terrible. Dr. Pearson, telephone. Yeah? Excuse me. Anybody I know? I doubt it. Trudy, sit down. Yes, Doctor? Oh, it'll be a sad day for Fallbridge when that young man leaves. Great ability. It's too bad that... What's too bad? Oh, no. It's not for me to violate a confidence. Still... No, no, no. You know you're going to tell me, Doctor, so... All right. Then, perhaps I should. Dr. Pearson is most unhappy. What about? About your engagement to Roy. Did he say so? More. He says you're engaged to a stuffy young man. Oh? And that's why he's going away. He's not happy, Trudy. He doesn't show it, you know, but... Well, population of East Fallbridge is about to increase. Mrs. Chanock. Edie Chanock? Oh, a fine, healthy girl. Her first. Say, how do I get there? Oh, if you go... Oh, well, no, you'd never find your way there. Not on these roads at night. Oh, I'd better drive you there myself. If you'd just hand me my gown... No, you can't do that. I know the house, Doctor. I'll take you there. Now, isn't that very generous of her? It's very sweet of you. Come on. I brought your hot milk. A lovely pair they'd make, huh? What on earth are you doing with my cousin Hattie's picture? And my album? Oh, well, they... When they... You see, it's... Old pictures, old wine. Old buttinsky. Well, another couple of weeks, I'll be on a boat. Going where? There's only one place to go this time of the year. Go south. Doesn't having a home mean anything to you? Well, you bet it does. That's why I have so many. What did I do? Say something funny? No, not you. Dr. McRory. He said you were going away heartbroken. Heartbroken? Over what? Me. He'd do anything to have you stay. Oh. He told me you were a pretty fine fellow. Cupid McRory, yeah? Well, he couldn't have set a more attractive trap. Thank you. Come in, Doctor. We've been waiting for you. Give me a lift with this bag, man. Oh, sure. I'll run along in. All right. Everything all right? Oh. Where's the doctor? He'll be in in a minute. Well, tell him to come right in the bedroom. And sit down, won't you? In there. Her ma's with her. Here. Let me have that. Is he any good? Dr. Pearson? Very good. Gee, I hope so. Dr. McRory couldn't come, huh? No, but you... Trudy, this is gonna take a little time. You better run along. I can get home all right. Oh, I'll wait. Is she all right, Doc? She's fine. Anything I can do? No. Well, yes. Do you have a checkerboard? Checkerboard? Makes the time go faster. Doctor. Yes? You better come in now. I'll be right with you. You take care of the father, huh, Trudy? I will. Gosh! It's my first one. There's my grandson. A boy? My son. Ed, she wants to see you. He's so little. And so... Well, here we are. I was asleep. Not much of a night's rest for a gal who has to be at school at 9:00 in the morning. You're frostbitten? Just cold. Let me see. Well? Roy? You were gonna meet me in a half hour. Some half hour. Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Roy. I meant to phone you. But a woman in East Fallbridge had a baby, and... Of course, you had to be there. Without your help, women in East Fallbridge couldn't have babies. Well, Chesley, it's really my fault. I didn't know the roads and she... I'd like you to keep out of this. I'd like to keep out of it, too, Roy. I'm sorry I've upset you. I tried to explain and I'm very tired. Good night. Good night, Doctor. I think with all your equipment, you better take my car. You can drop it off later. Thank you, Trudy. Oh, so it's Trudy now? Isn't that my name? You seem to forget that it's also gonna be Chesley. Roy, people are sleeping. Maybe you'd like to forget that we're engaged. When you talk that way, yes, I would. That's what I thought. Well, it's fine with me! I'll give you two minutes to take that back. She didn't mean that. She'll be right back. Then you better wait. I ought to punch your nose. Maybe I better wait. Yes, there's a couple of things I'd like to settle with you. Certainly. Now, don't think I'm worried. Miss Mason is far too smart to throw herself away on a hobo doctor. A guy who gets paid in jellies and sauerkraut. Not always. I had a very big day yesterday. I got pickles. I'm not thinking of myself. If I thought she'd be happy with you living in a freight car, I'd say, "Fine!" That's very noble of you. I can be noble. What's wrong with that? Nothing. I'm impressed. I'm thinking of her own good. Are you? Well, no. I don't think I am. Are your intentions marriage? Now, that's a notion I've always tried to avoid. Listen to me, Pearson... Wait a minute. Quiet. We seem to have picked up quite an audience. Let's keep it bright, huh? Boys, people are trying to sleep. I tried to sleep, too. In a chair, all night! Oh, Trudy, I'm sorry. I know you didn't mean what you said. But if you'd just keep away from this quack. Roy! He isn't interested in marriage, he just told me that. Trudy, I... I don't like to come between engaged people. He's upset. It's a natural misunderstanding. Out so late and everything. You needn't be alarmed, Doctor. Your freedom isn't in any danger, whether I'm engaged or not. And, Roy, I'm not. Good night, both of you. I wasn't of very much help, was I? I ought to punch you... Oh, here, let me see. There's no fracture, just put an icepack on it. Next time, don't telegraph your punches. You can wind up with no knuckles at all. Good morning. Well, what happened? Six pound boy. Boy, boy. Yeah. Just left Trudy, huh? Yes, and Roy. They've just broken their engagement. Have they now? Well, I hope you seized the opportunity, huh? All right, Doctor, don't you think you've done enough meddling? Meddling? A man tries to squeeze a little brains into that narrow, pig-headed skull of yours and you call it meddling? In my opinion, the girl's too good for you. If you'll pardon me, I'd like to wash my face. A girl with brains, a personality, an education and a good figure... Oh, you've gotten rude again. I was right about you the first time. Breakfast, Doctor. All right, all right. Uh... Doctor... Mrs. Gilley, you might inform Dr. Pearson that I'm not interested in what he has to say. Well, if I offended you... Yes, and that I'd much rather he didn't speak to me. Mrs. Gilley, would you remind Dr. McRory that he and I are grown men? What's gotten into you two? You have your instructions, Mrs. Gilley. Well, you heard each other. Mrs. Gilley, you might inform Dr. Pearson that he needn't bother to remain on here. Tell him I'd strongly recommend that he takes the 4:15 bus today. Mrs. Gilley, would you be good enough to tell Dr. McRory that I agreed to remain here until he was able to resume his practice? And I'll keep my word. Inform Dr. Pearson that he'll not get one penny salary after today. I'm busy frying eggs. You mind passing the sugar? Dr. McRory, Dr. Pearson would like the sugar. If you get a little time on your hands, thank him for me, will you? Good morning. Good morning, Mrs. Gilley. Good morning, Al. I see you got a new neighbor, Dr. Jenks. Jenks? Who? Who did you say? Dr. Jenks, across the street. Just moved in that little Chesley property last night. Oh, they're just visiting, no doubt. No, staying. Just ordered a whole lot of groceries. Well, see you tomorrow. The man's an idiot. Oh, he'll never last, Doctor. Nobody's gonna take your place in this town. Well, other doctors have come in here and lasted a month, at the longest. This fellow won't last three weeks. Three weeks? Three weeks. You still mad at me? No. Whatever made you think I was mad at you? Sit down there. Finish your breakfast. Smile right back at the sun At the sun The moment he catches your eye Your eye Oh, waking up can be fun Just depend on your friend in the sky In the sky If you start your daydreams early You can get a lot more done Oh! So, get up, get out, and smile right back at the sun Let's start again with a little... With what? Remember on the train when you cut yourself shaving? Yes, yes. Yeah. Jim. Huh? I don't think I'll go to the station with you. I don't like farewells. Well, I won't be leaving till 4:10, Doctor. What I think of it, my good friends call me Joe. Joe? I've liked working with you, Joe. Well, I wish I could say that I found you objectionable. Yeah? Yeah, then your going away would be a very happy occasion. Thank you, Joe. I'll pick you up after I see about my trunk. Hello, Doc. Hello, Harry. Gee, Pop, those are fighting words. Yeah. Hello, Emily. Hello, Dr. Pearson. Hi, Bill. Hiya, Doc. Well, let's have a drink, huh? What? You mean you want me to have a drink? Mmm-hmm. Kept this for a special occasion. You were right. It wasn't the drinking that was causing those headaches, Bill. Just got this letter from Dr. Sachs. Who's he? He's my old professor at medical school. He's an authority on pheochromocytoma. Pheochromo... Of the adrenal gland. Confirms my diagnosis. Do you mean I need a drink before I find out what happens to me? Oh, no. It's to celebrate. Oh, you mean, he can be cured? Mmm-hmm. There's the man that'll cure him. He's gonna perform the operation. Oh, an operation? Yeah. Oh, well, if it'll cure you, Pop. Why don't you operate? Oh, no, I'm leaving by the next bus. Say, could you meet me in Boston tomorrow? I can't get out of this town quick enough. Haven't you heard what's happened to Dr. McRory? No, what? Get a load of this poison. And now, we come to a subject... What I want to say is and I'm speaking for the entire board. We'll always appreciate your great service to Fallbridge. Yes. Thank you, thank you. Hello, Jim. Doctor. Gentlemen. We will proceed. We know the hospital is pretty close to your heart. Well, yes, it is. Well, it's close to our hearts, too. And we sort of feel that a doctor with more modern methods, with newer ideas... What's that? Well, to get down to brass tacks, Doc, times have changed and... You mean, you don't want me to run the hospital? We feel we need a younger man. A man like Dr. Jenks. If you'll excuse me. Just a minute, Joe. That was a very touching little speech, Mr. Chesley. Are you a member of this board, Pearson? If I was, I'd be ashamed to admit it. There's some pretty short memories here. I was present when this town paid a tribute, a fine tribute it was, to Dr. McRory and his 35 years of service. I didn't realize then how much he deserved the tribute, but I do now. I just want to add that in taking care of you people and your parents and your children, Dr. McRory has learned more about medicine than Dr. Jenks or I will ever get out of books. Listen, Pearson, you'll have to admit there are new methods, new discoveries in medicine. Oh, yes, very important discoveries, too. But no one has discovered a substitute for skill, or wisdom, or practical experience, or for goodness of heart. It isn't that we don't think highly of Doc. And he canceled all 'em debts, too. Now, wait a minute. Yeah, when we gave the party... Now, wait, wait, wait a minute. If Dr. McRory is the better man, there's a way to find out. A written examination. Conducted by the medical society. That seems fair. Yeah, I don't see how the Doc could object to a written examination. Oh, you don't, eh? I shouldn't have to remind you two fellows that Dr. McRory hasn't written an examination paper in almost 40 years. And Mr. Cartwright, before McRory saved your son's life, did you ask him to sit down like a school boy and write an examination paper? Oh, nobody's knocking the old Doc. But we want to do the progressive thing. And I think the examination is progressive. All in favor, say, "Aye." Aye. Aye. No. No. Six to two. It's carried. Let's go, Jim. Corresponding secretary will read his report. Joe, that examination, don't you think... No, no, I don't. No. I wouldn't. Ah, I've been here too long. A man's a fool to bury himself in one little corner of the world. Yeah, but, Joe, you wouldn't have too much trouble with that examination, really. Let's pretend that I wouldn't. At my age... Jim, would you believe it, I'm past 60? Really? Gee, I never would've guessed it. You wouldn't, huh? No, never. Well, what do you think of that? Joe? Would you like me to stay here awhile? Just sort of hang around, hmm? No, me boy. I'll be gone soon meself. Ah, you've got the right idea. Travel around, have a good time. You know, I might do that meself. Get me a job on one of those boats. Well, I don't think that you... Yes, I imagine I could fix it for you. Well, it's about time for the bus. Where's your grip? It's inside here in the hotel. You wouldn't like to wait around, would you? See me off? No. No, I don't think so. I think I'll walk home. It's a fine day. Well... Dr. Pearson, it's been a pleasure knowing you. Has been for me, Joe. Bye. Well, he... You see, I do a lot of business with Chesley. Yes, I understand. I'll see you again sometime. Leaving, Doctor? Hmm? Oh, hello, Miss Mason. Yes, finally. I called to say goodbye... But goodbyes aren't pleasant. No, they're not. You generally manage to avoid things that aren't pleasant. Yeah, if I can. Mmm-hmm. It's wonderful having a little world all your own, isn't it, Doctor? Your friends have problems, that's their misfortune. You just get on a little boat and your whole world is snug and cozy again. Say, wait a minute now, Teacher. Have you any idea what that hospital meant to Dr. McRory? Have you the vaguest notion what losing it will do to him? Aren't you confusing me with the Chesleys? I didn't take that job from Joe McRory. And my staying here wouldn't give it back to him. You could stay and help him prepare for the examination. Oh, he'd never take it. Not with his pride. Pride? That hospital is the dream of his life and you talk about pride? If you urged him to take the examination, he'd take it. If you coached him, he'd pass. But no, it's much more pleasant in Guatemala. And here's your bus. Have fun, Doctor. It's been nice knowing you. What do you mean, you're gonna work on a boat? A man of your age. Will you be good enough to pack, Mrs. Gilley? Oh, you're an impossible old fool. What will I pack? Everything. Everything? You mean... I wouldn't know where to begin. Neither would I. Jim? Did you miss the bus? No, took me back to the house. Joe, get your coat off. Me coat? Hang it up right there. Hmm? But what happened? Here's your glasses. Come on, you and I are going to work. To work? But... Yeah, but... All right. List the possible complications of pertussis. Go ahead, come on. Pertussis. Can't you just say whooping cough? Is a man a better doctor because he knows that measles is rubeola? Or that hordeolum is a sty in the eye? Or that tinea sycosis is the barber's itch? Ah, I'm not a school boy. I'm tired, I'm going to bed. Joe, you want that hospital, don't you? What conditions develop in advanced hypertrophic emphysema? Don't tell me, don't tell me. I won't. Polycythemia. Lowered vital capacity. Pulmonary vascular hypertension. Eberthella typhosa. Eberthella typhosa. It's getting a little late, Joe. You better get to bed. What? You better go to bed. No, no, tomorrow's the examination. Eberthella typhosa. Eberthella typhosa. Salmonella paratyphi. Salmonella paratyphi... Name the tests of liver function? How do you treat thyrotoxicosis? You can do it, Doc. Lots of luck to you, Doc. Yeah, Jenks ain't got a prayer. Thanks. I'll do my best. Our man's in great shape. He'll win without taking a long breath. Say, Mort, if you get over to the barber shop, will you put this sawbuck on McRory's nose? Okay. Oh, you shouldn't have done that. Oh, you'll gallop. You'll breeze. Come on. You know, Jim, once when I was a little boy, just before an arithmetic examination, I started sneezing and they sent me home. I wish I was sneezing now. Oh, you're gonna win, all right. You gotta win. Get in there. Hello, Doctor. How do you do? Mr. Dorkas, I understand there's quite a lot of gambling going on over at the barber shop? Some, yeah. Would you bet that dollar for me? Why, Mrs. Gilley. Warm, isn't it? All finished, Doctor. Dr. Jenks. Yes? Mr. Chesley wants you over at the school house right away. School house? Some kids are sick. What's that? What's the matter? Don't know, Doc. I'll be right with you. Well, thank you, sir. You'd better finish. You only have 25 minutes to catch the bus, Dr. Morton. I know. Doctor, hurry up, please. We've got a terrible situation. Yes, I'm coming. Open your mouth. Open up. That's it. Here's the basin, Trudy. Where do you want it? Over there? Ah, throat's red. Is it anything serious? Eddie's my nephew. He's Lucy's boy. Well, four boys sick at one time, food poisoning's ruled out. And I don't like these dizzy headaches. These youngsters been out of school lately? George was absent yesterday, but he wasn't sick. He was emotionally upset. His horse died. Horse died? What from? They didn't know. What are those marks on that boy's arm? Uh-huh. Mosquito bites. Yeah. Mosquito? Yes, looks like it. What's it? What's the matter, huh? Oh, hello, Miss Mason, Chesley. These your pupils? Yes, Doctor. Maybe you can help. That won't be necessary. It's a fairly obvious case. Is it? What is it? It's not a common disease, Doctor. I don't believe you'd know about it. I might. Well, if I'm not mistaken, this is equine encephalitis. Mosquitoes carry the virus, chickens harbor it. The disease is more common among horses. Aren't you being a little hasty, Jenks? If not wasting time is being hasty, yes. Doctor, is it fatal? There was an epidemic in Massachusetts in 1938. More than 50% of the children died. Equine... What did you call it? Oh, call it virus brain fever. Brain fever? Brain fever! What? Brain fever? Stay here. Roy, call Bentonville. Tell them to get an ambulance here at once. Hello, Operator. Get me Bentonville, the hospital. Hurry, please. I said, Bentonville, the hospital. Such telephone service. Yes, the Bentonville Hospital. Hurry, please. Psst. This is Roy Chesley, let me speak to Dr. Wheaton. Hello, Dr. Wheaton, we need an ambulance for the Fallbridge Public School. The Fallbridge Public School! Why don't you listen to me? At the school. S-C-H-O-O-L! Virus brain fever, four boys have got it. Hurry, please. Line to Bentonville is busy. Some kids at school got brain fever. Must be an epidemic. We were right. Take a look. It's a virus, all right. That's nice work, Joe. Come on. Long distance. Long distance. Get me back that Washington number I was talking to. I was cut off. Doctor, if I may make a suggestion... Not now, if you don't mind. We're getting a vaccine from Washington. Yeah, but... Dr. Jenk's case, Joe. Customary ethics. Give me Congressman Beeker. He'll know who it is. Mr. Chesley, I can't allow you to... Please. Please. Hello. Give me Congressman Beeker. Oh, is that you, Congressman? This is Charlie Chesley, in Fallbridge. Charlie, who? Chesley! C-H-E... Well, you remembered me before the election. Oh, yes, yes. Well, what can I do for you, Chesley? Yeah, well, that's better. Now, listen, Congressman, my nephew's got equine... Equine what? Encephalitis. Yeah, my nephew's in a coma. He got it from a horse. Where did the horse get it? From chickens. Chickens? Now, listen, Congressman, the War Department has got that vaccine and I want some of it flown up here and I want it quick. It's for equine encephalitis. Do you plan to vaccinate everybody in town? Uh, naturally. Roy. Dad, get 2,400 doses. We need 2,400 doses. Twenty four... What? For one horse? This is not for a horse, it's for chickens. What chickens? Uh, for my nephew. Say, look here, Chesley, I'm a busy man. Congressman? Operator? Operator? All right. It's all right. You've got nothing to worry about. The vaccine will keep the disease from spreading. Well, if it isn't being too unethical, I suggest you forget the vaccine. Dr. McRory here has a simpler cure. Yeah. Me own prescription is a hairbrush. A hairbrush? What? Yeah, a hairbrush. Vigorously applied across the seat of the pants. Huh? What are you talking about? Well, it's the best cure I know for 12-years-olds who've been smoking cigars. What? I feel better already, Doc. Me, too. Boys! You won't tell Pop, will you? Swell job, Doc! Oh, Mr. Cartwright, let's get rid of this. You'll start another epidemic. Good work, Doc. Mr. Chesley, if you'll only let me explain, I am certain... Get away from me, you horse doctor, you! Everything's all right. You can go home now. Oh, Miss... Teach! Yes? I'm surprised at you. You shouldn't permit your kids to smoke cigars. Oh, I guess I shouldn't... Well, you're just gonna have to be a little more careful with our kids. Oh, don't be so smart. No, wait. Come here. Listen, Joe, the hospital, it's yours. But I don't want the hospital. But, Joe... For 35 years, I've been thinking of Fallbridge, now I'm thinking of meself. Oh, Joe. It's a big job for a man of my age. Unless, of course, Dr. Pearson stays on to assist me. Oh, I'm sorry, Doctor, my plans are already made. Unless, of course, Miss Mason... I think it could be arranged. I think it could be arranged.
