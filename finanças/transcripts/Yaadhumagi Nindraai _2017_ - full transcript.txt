Beep Our country is one, which celebrates women as Goddesses But only in such a place as ours, do women suffer! The men here, embrace the woman who carried them in her womb, as a mother! They even accept the woman who carries their child in her womb, as a wife! But, they hesitate to take up a woman, as their daughter! They fail to develop the thought that a man and a woman are equal! And no one takes an effort to change this scenario.. On the other hand, the women these days, beautifully utilize the opportunities they have and shine in all fields of work! Given all this, women still have not been able to escape the inhumanity of some men This is the story of such a woman, who tumbled in life and went down the wrong lane.. Hey! Who are you? You are not supposed to sleep here! What man! Haven't you learnt to get drunk yet? You must've got used to this taste by now! When are you going to try all this? -Anna! - Huh? - I'm hungry, Anna! What? - Anna, food! Food? What would you give me for that? There's nothing left with me to give, Anna! - What do you have in that bag? Nothing, Anna.. nothing! - Give that to me! Please please.. give it back.. please Anna! - See what's inside that! Hey! She is drunk man! Bro.. Hand that beer over to me! She's made a mess!! Leave me man! I'll break her jaw! Leave that poor girl! - You shut up! Touch me now! Come at me now! - Shut up, man! Are you trying to escape with this?! I will break your face! Let go of my hand now! Leave me.. Let go of my hand! - You idiot! Touch me if you are a man! All you want is to see some body right? Touch me if you dare! Will you not let a girl walk alone on the road? I will kill you! You Come with me.. If he does too much throw that molester in the railway track! You sit here.. Give me those betel leaves - Good morning Great mother! Bless you! - Who is this? Damn! You just brought an old lady yesterday and today you have brought some pest with you? Does this look like asylum to you? Why are you doing like this? - Ma, I pity her. Please let her stay Three men were trying to molest her. I am not able handle my own problems, why are you finding new ones for me now? She is a married woman, she will leave once she heals.. - Hey! What is your problem? Why are you roaming around? Who are you? I am Kannagi! ( A famous dialogue from an old Tamil movie "Poompuhar") Ma, don't laugh at me! Why are you laughing? I find your actions funny! You could try to be more serious! I am leaving! Poorni has come! Don't you talk to me! Okay okay! Don't get mad at me! Do well and win the competition! Okay, give me that Okay bye! Here, have it, ma! - Please keep this in account too! There's already three months of due.. How could I have this in due as well? Please Anna, I will settle it all in two or three days.. How many more days of time should I give you? Leave the place! - Please give me, Anna! Do you have a lot of homework to do? - Yes, mom! Here, have this cup of tea - Mom, shall I dance for the group? Nothing is needed. Mind your studying now What do you want to study? - I want to become a teacher! Thamarai? - I want to study engineering! You are a bright student. You would come off with flying colours Okay take your seat! Hey fool! Do you think engineering is that simple? Do you know how much it costs? Around 40 or 50 thousand! We are not fit to study engineering We can only do tailoring! What do you aspire to become? - I would like to become a lawyer What is this Sumathi? How many more days should I grant you? The interest is more than 50 and the principal amount is yet to be paid I don't know what you will do. From now on, on the 5th of every month you must pay the following month's due as well! I do not get offers to dance like the old times. I am growing old, right? Please give me some more time I will pay the following month's due as well Stop making lame excuses! Isn't Saroja like you too? Doesn't she let her daughter dance? My daughter is studying so well Why should we push her into this? Pay the debts soon Akka.. Else you will have to pay a heavy interest. Then, it'll be a big problem for you.. - I shall take leave You have grown up! What is your name? - Thamarai Do you dance? - Yes I have told your mother.

When we turn into children, and our mother is the Sky, It's our love's lullaby Blinding the eye, With wind, does it fly, Will our love never die? I fell for you the first time I saw you! We shall speak those words unspoken so far by mankind itself Like fish and water, and Honey and flower, We shall be together, never apart! Come in! The door is open only! Hey! Didn't I ask you to come early? -Master, you were the one who... Don't say all that! Don't we have to shoot tomorrow? Keep the bottle there and leave! Why does he have to confuse me like this? I'll take leave, master! Shall I leave, master? - Drop her in her room and go.. Okay, master! Ohoooo.. O.... When this unquenchable thirst fuels the fire inside, Will love be the one to save us? At a time like this, when I've become you, Will love play a con game with us? While we rest on each other will our love rest for eternity too? Those miles of distance where you are missing Will I have to cross them without you? While I'm getting drenched by the rain inside me, Come and dry me with a kiss Unanswered questions and an endless bond Will all of it be a result of this? When we turn into children, and our mother is the Sky, It's our love's lullaby Blinding the eye, with wind, does it fly, Will our love never die? We shall speak those words unspoken so far by mankind itself Like fish and water, and Honey and flower, We shall be together, never apart Oh God! I'm going to confess my love today You should be my support always! I'll come often to give you offerings! I'll even offer my daily commissions to you -Ganesh must pick up my call somehow!

Master, accompany us for the editing too! - Okay, sir. Kanna! Hey! Where's Kanna? He has not come for the shooting, master! - Didn't I tell you in Madras that the girls should be good? The producer is yelling at me for the dancers performing badly! Master, they want you to adjust a bit. We weren't able to find other girls, master Hey! I can choreograph a song even without dancers now! I'm helping them by giving them a job, and are they taking advantage of me for it? Production! Give me some water! Please forgive us this time master.. Master.. Let them dance this once.. Ask them to stand in their positions! Ready? Go to your positions! Hurry! Yuvaraj! - Tell me, master! Thamarai shouldn't be here.. - Master! How can I send her alone? - Hey! Don't ask me about all that!

Give the count properly and do it correctly! I can choreograph a song even without dancers now! I'm helping them by giving them a job.. Are they taking advantage of me for it? Thamarai shouldn't be here.. Ask the manager to arrange for her ticket back home Else, I'll leave this place without a second thought Understood? So, were you here only? I was searching all over the place for you! What happened? Why did he send you? If there's any problem, let me know! I'll take care.. What if he is not there? Isn't there any other master? You don't feel bad for anything! I'll be there for you.. Okay.. Do you want anything to eat? You shouldn't sleep with an empty stomach. - No, thank you.. Let me lie down.. - Okay, you take rest, I'll be right back.. Didn't you get a ticket? I was in a hurry, so I didn't take one. Sit here. Make yourself comfortable.. Are you and your mother the only ones at home? How about your father? I don't have my father.. He left my mother and I to suffer alone when I was too young I haven't seen even him in a photograph! I studied in an all girls school. I grew up not knowing anything about men! When it comes to guy friends, it is just you all! How about your family? It's just me and my younger brother for me! Our parents died in an accident when we were kids.. Then it was our uncle who brought us up. He paid for our education.. and even got me a job! He is also in the cinema industry as a cameraman.. That's why I got this chance.. I became a dancer as well.. Have you slept off? I was just about to confess my love. This is how you should sleep off right in the middle of something important! We must inform Kanna and ask him to avoid this matter from reaching the other dancers.. You give it a thought! - If you don't pay your dues, you'll be in trouble! Please give us some time! - What's the problem, mom! We haven't paid the dues yet.. The money you sent got used up for my medicines! How can you pay your dues? Do you know what she has done? She has fought with Ganesh! You know his background right? Anna, you aren't aware of the incident at all! - You shut up! Anna, please give me a month's time.. I'll pay you. Hey wait. Anna, all that you want is your money right? I'll pay you! Brother, mind your own business.. I know just enough! You will get your money tomorrow. You take your mother inside. Boy, if I don't get my money tomorrow, you will have to pay for it! - Okay, Anna! Hey! Did you get into a dispute with Ganesh master? The whole guild is talking about you! Hey! Does this concern you in anyway? Why do you keep poking your noses in others' businesses? Why did you do this? Didn't I ask you to control your temper? I warned you that you are taking the wrong path.. Listen, Thamarai.. New dancers have joined.. If you keep doing this, you'll run out of chances! See, they make me dance in the last row because I look dark and fat. Some of these masters don't even give me a chance.. It's just some of these known masters who give me a song.. We are supposed to earn our keep.. This is the due that Thamarai is supposed to pay Well well! I see you've kept your word! - Please avoid making a scene henceforth.. Why would I make a scene if I get my dues properly? Okay, you leave! - Okay, Anna. Bye. I've given the money, Thamarai! Shall we leave? Hey! I'll return your money in a month.. You need a constant source of income for it. Start working for female masters.. Am I right, bro? Yes! What he says is right! You start working for lady masters.. Okay, let's leave! 1,2! 1,2..Turn! Do it, do it! Dance heavily, fellows! For the first time in my life, I was helped by a man! Yeah, Prasad treated my problem as his own and helped me get out of it. He got a special place in my heart. The friendship that we had, slowly bloomed into Love Hey.. Only two idlis (South Indian food)? - Dude, doesn't this idli.. look like our Thamarai? - Ya ya! Hey Vishwa! Didn't you say that your parents are searching for a bride for you? How did it go? All set? - Hey! You never told us? Dude, look! Vishwa is blushing! Ya, as if I am Shakespeare's Juliet! And I'm blushing! I'm already mad! - But why? Then what? Just when I thought people from our industry don't get a house for rent, it happens in even getting a bride! Bloody hell! Is that so? I thought it was a problem only for girls! Hey! I have an idea. Wouldn't we get a bride if we go to Dubai and earn? Huh? Even then, do you think that there will be a line of girls waiting for us? I overheard you guys talking about cinema! Aren’t you all dancers? No sir! I am this area's MLA, she is an MP and that one is the councilor! If you need anything, let us know! We'll be there as a gang! Hey keep it shut! We are dancers only, sir I saw you dancing in one of Rajini sir's movies last week! I don't like wasting time! I don't watch TV big time! Sir, televisions aren't that big! They're just small.. Did you have your coffee? Pay your bill and leave the place! - Hey shut up, man! That's not the thing, dude.. They all turn on their TV and watch it with awe Later, if they see us in person, they start talking about not wasting time! -Yeah, that's what they do! Leave that! What were you saying about the idli looking like Thamarai(Lotus)? Then, why do you have it in your plate? Put it in the water! Hey! Look how she is laughing! So if idli is laughing, then is sambhar crying? This master is not like what you think. So be cautious.. - Look, the master is here! Master! - Good morning, Master.. What Prasad? How are you? - I'm good, Master! Where are you working now? - With Tarun master! Oh! So, what did you come here for? Master, this is Sumathi's daughter! - Oh! I told you earlier, right? She wants to work as your assistant! Oh! Are you Sumathi's daughter? - Ya, Master! I heard that your mother is sick.. - Ya, Master - Ya, Master Mother's health is very bad. She's been shuttling between the hospital and home You're fine, aren't you? I've heard about you! Heard you're a loud mouth? Hey! Come here! Weren't you the one who gossiped about her? Hmm... It is not easy to get a chance in Cinema. Well, come home! Let me see what can be done! Hey Kanna! Dumb head! Come here! Stupid! Idiot! Note this girl down.. I'll get going, then! -Thanks, master! Did you see what that fatso has told about you, Thamarai? Be careful where you go! Let's go.. Get in the line, all of you! Come on! Don't you look so stylish? - No, master.. Alright! Ready! Position! Ready! 1,2.. Okay, okay.. Go on! Go and stand there - Hurry up and form a line 1,2..! Master, they are doing it wrongly! - Cut, cut, cut! What are you doing? Keep this in your mouth and blow it! Don't you all have sense? What are you doing here? Shake that body and dance properly! What's the need to talk here? Hey, you! Don't you know how to move it like this? What are you staring at? Teach them properly! Dance properly all of you! Blow it! 1,2!! Where is the director? Call him! He's here, master! Hey! What's happening? Why is it getting late? I don't know.. Let me see - Give me the song paper.. Field clear! Don't stand there! - Thamarai, put on your scarf the other way! Akka, the boys are ready! Shall I ask them to stand in position? Is it ready? - Prasad! All okay? - Okay! Hey! Hold on! What did you call me? - Prasaaad! 1,2,3,4! This is what you call a movement! 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8! Very good! Very good! - Okay okay okay.. Master! We'll pack up with this. - Why? The hero is busy, it seems! - Busy for what? Liquor? Pack up! Hey Prasad! Go and get my payment from the cashier.. Thamarai, can you go and get master's payment? I need to go somewhere! Get it soon! - Hey! It's perfect, sir! - How much do you want? No, I don't need anything, Kanna will give me No, you don't have to hesitate! - No... Balu! Sir, she is not of that type! She wouldn't have asked anything. Thamarai! What have you done? Why do you keep bringing trouble wherever you go? Won't you ever learn? You have spoilt master's reputation as well If you continue this, you'll have to go to Dubai like those girls, Viji and Saraswathi Okay, be in the vehicle. I'll see you there Hey Kanna! You moron! Come soon. - I'll Be right there! What happened, Thamarai? - I deserve this for trusting you! Don't you ever show me your face! - What happened? Thamarai, why are you so short tempered? Why do you get mad for silly things? Don't you know to be respectful to masters? Leave me.. You have no idea what happened! This is Kanna.. Is Thamarai around? Hello! Tell me, Kanna! Thamarai, I'm Prasad speaking! Please don't hang up on me! Are you nuts? Why are you lying to call me? - Thamarai! Please listen to me! Sorry, Thamarai! I should've accompanied you that day! I'll not leave you alone anymore.. Hello! Thamarai? Just listen to me for a moment! - Didn't I tell you not to come? Leave! Thamarai! Listen to me! It was a mistake considering you a friend! - Thamarai, I'm sorry! It was my fault leaving you alone! - Are you making a scene here? Are you apologizing after doing all that? Leave! Thamarai, please open the door! Let's discuss! Don't show me your face! Clear the place now! Cholesterol is high! There's lung congestion too.. You must take all your doses properly.. Here, take this.. Come for your checkup regularly.. What's the matter, Thamarai? - I can't find my name in the group.. I don't have a job.. - I don't know much about it.. Ask the in charge about it.. - Okay, mam! There are some financial troubles.. Can I pay the due next month? What? Weren't you paying them properly so far? Why have you started it like old times again? No sir, there haven't been any chances for six months If your daughter keeps getting everyone into trouble will they keep inviting her for more? Hey, hold on! She doesn't have a good name in the union also.. Why should we bother about that? See what has to be done now! If both of you stay jobless at home how would you repay me? Pack your things up and leave the house this month Mohan, please be a bit patient! - Your house might be taken on lease Anna, give me the document! Sign on it, ma! - Sign the document.. Hey, we'll go meet some other master! Why should we see this guy? Good morning, master! Hey, give them the invitation. - Don't forget to come, Vishwa! He is coming this way.. Are you sure that you want to ask? Come to my wedding without fail da! - Okay, master Master! - Tell me, Thamarai? Whatever happened on that day was my mistake I've forgotten all that! Master, can we both get a chance to dance in your song? You both have grown so fat gobbling up the production meals! Haven't you noticed how thin the new dancers are! First, focus on reducing your weight! He is making such a fuss! Aiyoh! My father's alcoholic, and my mother supports him anyway! I can't be jobless even for a day! Who calls us for shooting these days? Added to all that, I am a born beauty, ain't I? If I try to get a job outside the film industry, I am rejected because I worked in this industry!! If I try to approach a bank for loan, they chase me away for the same reason! Try getting a house for rent? They will chase us away for the same reason! Where else do you think we can go? Do you know where I've been staying this week? Why didn't you tell me about it earlier? - You are in a lot of trouble yourself! We neither have a degree, nor know any other work.. We must earn with only dance! - I can just understand how much my mother would've struggled! She is very sick too.. Whom does she have other than me? Our kind of dancer job has a very short life span! We can work only till we are physically strong! Then? Many new people have emerged! And, we need money! Shall we go to Dubai and dance there? I even have a friend who is dancing there! Shall we go? - Yes.. We shall go! Soon! We thought that cinema people would lead a luxurious life.. But, does it mean that, as you say, even they have their own part of troubles? I've heard so ill about all the people from film industry! Is that true? We cannot stereotype all of them.. There are good people too.. Like, Kanna, Vishwa, Anand and a few others Well, the auto driver who misbehaved wasn't from Cinema, was he? There are good and bad men. It just depends on their character. But,when I feel that there are majority in the bad side, it hurts When you went to Dubai, wasn't there anyone who helped you? I met someone in Dubai.. Thamarai? - Who is it? Prasad! Welcome.. How are you? - I'm good, ma Isn't Thamarai around? - Thamarai is out of town. Out of town?! Hi Cheta (brother)! - Hi My name is Thamarai. This is Sophia - Hello.. You looked fairer in the photograph! - The flash must have been bright! Welcome to Dubai! How was your flight journey? It was our first time, cheta! There were a lot of rules to follow! They wanted us to wear our seat belts too. - It was all shaky and we got scared! Ya, cheta. Even the food tasted bad. They gave us half boiled rice! You don't have to worry about all that here! There's is a malayali cook! She'll make you good food. - Ooh, Alright alright! Hello? Girls are arriving in the Bombay- Hyderabad flight that landed. I'm bringing two Chennai girls with me.. You too follow. - Cheta? What is that? - This is mobile phone.. Can we talk with anyone from this? - Yes, you can talk with anyone! How about to India? - Yes, you can.. But you have to pay! Submit your passports and signed agreements once you reach. Okay, Cheta - Okay. This is my place. Give me your passports. - Alright, ask him if we can go out! Ah, one thing! You aren't supposed to go out alone without my permission, owing to security problems here.. - That's alright, Cheta We don't have costumes for dancing! Cheta, we don't have to wear vulgar costumes, do we? There are a lot of rules here, but you don't have to worry about that! First, you sign! The important thing is, you must not give your land-line number to anyone. Understood? Hi Cheta! - This is Thamarai, and that is Sofie; cinema dancers Cheta? I need to call my mom - Ya, I've got a call card for you. Here! Okay, get ready soon. We have all of Dubai to see Welcome, Prasad! Sit, sit! What's up? - Anna, I had gone to Thamarai's house. Okay..? - I was told that she has gone out of town So I thought maybe you would know something I think she has gone to Dubai - Dubai? Hmm, keep this to yourself.. The place that you are seeing is Gold Souk Cheta, are these all duplicate jewels? - No! they're pure gold! Prasad? What are you doing? From now on, you can speak with Thamarai from here itself Hello! Aren't you both cine dancers? You'll continuously be called to dance for a week from now! Have a sip.. Are you ready? - Cheta, boys won't lay hands on us, right? No, no! You don't have to worry about all that. I'll take care of you I have a daughter too! Alright, let's get going! Why are you drinking now? - Just thought it would relax me! Oh, no! you go first! - No! you go first! Generally, I thought only cinema dancers would go to Dubai for dancing. But, going there made me realize that many poor girls have come there too Girls become ready to face any kind of difficulty to handle their problems Hello, amma? How are you? I'm fine! How are you, sweetheart? I'm fine too, ma But I'm missing you. I don't like the fact that you have gone to Dubai. Come back soon! I hear bad things about Dubai. I'm scared for you. Since you both have gone to dance in Dubai, they have decided to cancel your cards Okay, leave all that. We'll take care! What else, ma? Prasad comes here often He keeps asking about you! Don't tell him anything. I'll call him up myself Ma? Please get up. It's not Roja (rose) anymore, it's Thamarai (lotus)! Sir? - Who is she? She has come from Chennai. - Oh! Who's the lad? - My son-in-law! Prasad comes here often I feel happy that he visits me! He even helps me with money If he visits your mother and inquires about you, then I think that he loves you! Hello! -Hey Peanut! How are you, man? - Hey beetle! How are you? - I'm doing good! Why did you go to Dubai all of a sudden? No da.. We ran out of jobs there.. - Why are you the only one talking? Wouldn't the madam to talk? - Hold on, Sir! Here, have it. He wants to talk to you only.. Talk! Hello? Sophie wanted to say "I love you"! - Why did you say that I told?! O Perpetual Love Come before me There's no one like you here A never-given gift Give it to me I won’t exist without you O Perpetual Love Come before me There's no one like you here A never-given gift Give it to me I won’t exist without you Come close to me Give me 100 kisses My life becomes meaningless without your gaze O Perpetual Love Come before me There's no one like you here A never-given gift Give it to me I won’t exist without you I’m astounded to see me changed I laugh at those days, where you are away Though you stay far, I’ll walk next to you Because you are close to my heart I’m oscillating in my loneliness Enjoying the never ending love feel We become whole when we are together Must enjoy our nights with music I see many hopes in our life Confirm it from the right choices we mad Though time and distance separates us We have the growing desire to live Love is the magical genie Plays us like a puppet Makes us long for care and pamper Thus love plays with our feelings Love starts from the mind blossoms in the heart It stays in heart forever and it’s celebrates by keeping us together Even a recently listened melody Stirs your memory I’m astounded to see me changed I laugh at those days, where you are away Though you stay far, I’ll walk next to you Because you are close to my heart I’m oscillating in my loneliness Enjoying the never ending love feel We become whole when we are together Must enjoy our nights with music I see many hopes in our life Confirm it from the right choices we mad Though time and distance separates us We have the growing desire to live O Perpetual Love Come before me There's no one like you here A never-given gift Give it to me I won’t exist without you O Perpetual Love Come before me There's no one like you here A never-given gift Give it to me I won’t exist without you I just told! Hey who are you? - Just don't panic! Just relax! Come on, yaar! -Cheta.. Cheta... By the way, I'm Suresh Ad film maker No problem! You have such an appealing face.. Why didn't you choose modeling? Actually, I've chosen you as a model for my Ad agency. Hello! Who are you? - No, sir! Come, watch the dance and leave! - Please listen, sir I'm an Ad film maker I want her to be my model.. I'll pay you one million! It's a good offer.. Think about it and let me know.. But, soon! Given that even a 100 or 200 thousand is itself too much for us, he is ready to pay us 1 million! It's not about that.. What if Cheta mistakes us? No, no! He is not that type of a person! He is kind-hearted.. It's just that there are a lot of rules in this six month agreement.. I think it's better that I inform my mother about it. - Okay, talk to her. This should be kept away from the girls. Else, I'll be in trouble! No, cheta! We'll not reveal it. I'm not sure of what happened. Here she comes! Did you talk to your mother? - She didn't pick the call, what do we do? It's all your decision. You think and decide! Without makeup, you look proper Tamilian! - Sign here. Can I have her passport too? Welcome to my company! Hey let's hurry! - Sofie, ready? Hey Sophia! What happened? - Thamarai's mother is very sick! There's no time to discuss It's time for the flight! Let's go! Thamarai! You came as a surprise! Did you miss me? My darling! Prasad! Thamarai is back from Dubai. She never told me that she was coming back But I feel so happy! I'll talk to her about "that"! Hi Akka! - How are you all? - We're fine, Akka! Ma! Thamarai Akka is here! Welcome, Thamarai. Didn't Sophia come with you? She said she'll come right after me. Hasn't she called you? No, ma - She hasn't even made a call. Here, have this ma! - Ask Sophia to call me, okay? Ya, I'll tell her - Come, let's go.. Thamarai, this is my brother, Arjun. I've been speaking with you over phone only, Anni (Sister-in-law) I'm just meeting you in person - Thamarai? Where did you go? - To Sophia's house I told you that I had something important to talk to you, didn't I? Prasad will tell you what it is! Prasad, tell her yourself.. Arjun, come with me! I missed you so much, Thamarai! I wanted to come to Dubai myself. Thank goodness, you yourself came back! I thought your mother would tell you, but she put me up to it! We have been in a relationship for a long time Why should we postpone getting married anymore? What do you say? You don't need this dance or Dubai anymore I'll take care of that! What do you say? - Thamarai? What's hurry to get married now? - Are you mad? Why are you saying such things? Prasad, she is ignorant! I, her mother, will take care! You fix the date and tell me. - Bye, ma Bye, Anni! Thamarai? Why do you keep thinking? When you were in Dubai, it was Arjun and Prasad who took care of me If I'm alive today, it's because of them Even if he hadn't asked, I would have asked him to marry you and to take good care of you Don't you see from our family how important a male support is? A woman's life is revolved around men! I'll always speak for your good. Don't confuse yourself, okay? Hello? Who is it? - Prasad, this is Thamarai. Hi Anni! How are you? It's me. Arjun, Prasad's brother! Can you call Prasad, please? - Ya, hang on. Hey, Prasad! Anni is calling you! Have you been waiting for a long time? - No. Didn't you say you wanted to tell me something important? I want to tell you something. In Dubai... Speaking of Dubai, isn't it hot out here? I'll go buy us some ice cream. - Hey! Hey, why do you look so dull? Didn't we come out to talk freely? - (giggles from the nearby table) Don't laugh. You come out only if I call you to a restaurant. No, darling! Tomorrow, we shall meet our usual restaurant. Bye darling! See that fool go! It's all just for a few days. Love doesn't suit our life - Chuck it, boss! Let's mind our business. Hey! What's the matter? Prasad, in Dubai... - Listen! It's been four days since you returned. And it's been 40 minutes since we came here You are even unaware of what's happening around you People who are playing in the name of love are pampering each other I don't care what you think I just want you to be my wife. When you were in Dubai, it was Arjun and Prasad who took care of me If I'm alive today, it's because of them - I'm not here to ask you to marry me You are my wife! From now on, don't think about dance or Dubai I'll take care of everything - Why should we postpone anymore? Ma, has Kanna not come? He is in a shooting. Don't you know about our job? We can't even be present for any occasion Now both of you exchange the plates ( Wedding ritual ) Thamarai? You called him brother, but today.. - Hey, shut up! Thamarai.. Didn't you invite your BFF Sophia? She is missing? I went to her house and it was locked. Even the Dubai phone line was dead. Okay, Thamarai. We'll see what can be done Why are you dull? What happened now? Don't you like this wedding? If not for me, can't you smile at least for your mother? Is it because you miss Sophia? She would've made you laugh, right? Okay, don't confuse yourself. I heard that there's a lot of payment pending Have a look at it. - Okay, master! Hey, Prasad! - Master! That's alright! I heard that you got married? Ya, master - That's happy news. Come home one day Sure! Wait here. I'll be right back. Have you returned from Dubai? Heard your card's been canceled? - Hey, move! Why do you keep building unwanted conversations? How are you, Thamarai? - I'm doing good. Sorry,ma I wasn't able to make it to you wedding. I got a song to work on - That's okay Come home for lunch sometime - Sure, ma Convey my regards to your mom Why are you wearing my shirt? - Just for fun! Shouldn't I? Okay, what does "brother" mean? - "D-day"! Then what does "D-day" mean? - It means Today! Is that so? - Yeah! So, you've been meaning this all along? - Yeah! - Yeah? So what does "darling" mean? - That is "Today"! Hey wifey, standing in front of me Hey wifey, standing in front of me Breezing cold winds You are my Ooty (hill station in Tamilnadu) O moon wrapped in cloth, While shyness is afar Don't you run and hide! With your hair as the rope, Don't tie and haul me! First master Then bungalow.. Hey wifey, standing in front of me Breezing cold winds You are my Ooty O moon wrapped in cloth, While shyness is afar Don't you run and hide! With your hair as the rope, Don't tie and haul me! Your face being sunkissed in the evening In my heart you shall merrily swing Whisper your wish in my ear For your wish will be my command, dear! Keep some for the liquor! - I'll punch you! Like the wind blowing on the windowsill When I caress, What do you feel? Why do you slip when I fondle? O womanhood! It's for good if you let me handle! Why do you like me? - Because you're chubby like a cheese ball!- I'll hit you! And in our love life we are interdependent like parts of the same plant Your face being sunkissed in the evening In my heart you shall merrily swing Whisper your wish in my ear For your wish will be my command, dear! Hey chubby!? Really? Hey wifey, standing in front of me Hey wifey, standing in front of me Breezing cold winds You are my Ooty! - Heyyy happy birthday! Hey wifey, standing in front of me Maa! - Anni! What happened? Breezing cold winds Krishna! You are my Ooty! Hey wifey, standing in front of me Hey wifey, standing in front of me Breezing cold winds You are my Ooty! Here, give him water first. Baby! Have you packed everything? - Ya.. Give this to Mohan - Haven't you given him yet? No, we had medical expenses, right? This is for mother's medicines. And give this to brother, for his college expenses This is for Kichaa! - Get it, get it! Don't forget his vaccine. Bye, Chubby! - Be careful How are you, Anna? - I'm fine, ma Which dancers are coming with you? - Kumar, Shanthi.. Everyone from your batch only. All of them are coming. It's just that you and Sophia are missing. That's alright Shall we go, then? - Have a safe journey Anna.. - I'll take care. Bye. - Bye. Here, have this. Hey! Here! What are you pondering about? I have decided to become a master. All these newcomers have started becoming masters How longer can we be just assistants? - Ya, da! They push us back because we are old. Moreover, we have a lot of flooring moves. Think about it briefly and then decide, because even top masters are idle You need good speaking skills for that, and also Luck. Luck? You must massage the hero's legs for that. And you must visit a lot of companies - And you must go behind the director Just like a temple in every street, there are new masters emerging and there are dance classes too - Don't you get it? We can be dancers only till we are fit Once we are back, let's discuss with Thamarai and decide It seems sir never decides anything against Thamarai's will - Shut up, dude - Hey! If Prasad becomes a master, I'll be his first assistant and you be the second Ya, okay! -It's just the two of us, okay? Come in, dude. Wanna join our cards game? It's 10 bucks per game. Let's go out somewhere - Let's get drunk Hey, let me go get ready - Go bathe! Where shall we go? - Let's go for a movie Which one? - We are going for a Malayalam movie Get ready soon! Shall I take some liquor with me? - Okay Hey Anand, if only my wife gets to know that I'm going to watch an Adult movie.. - Hey! Are we going to an Adult film? - Didn't you know that? Didn't he tell you? - If Thamarai gets to know, she'll kill me! Hey, are you acting? Listen, things are different before and after marriage! My life has changed after Thamarai came into it I've not even bought her a gold chain for her Thaali (Auspicious necklace - a symbol of marriage) She is still wearing a yellow thread in it's place She doesn't even mind that much. Just this (drinking habit) I shall end it today Hey! What is it? Hey.. Tell me it's not her! It's not her! It's not my Thamarai - Let's go! It's not my Thamarai! I'll not leave without watching Leave me! Hey! Is the shooting over? - What kind of a woman are you?! You third rated woman! Are you cheating on me? Are you making a scene getting drunk? - Yes, what will you do? What did you do in Dubai? I can't understand what you are asking! - Prasad, why are you doing this? Don't come near me - We thought you were a good man It was I who got cheated thinking that you are good people What did my daughter do? - Go to a Kerala theater and see! Your daughter has gone to Dubai and acted nude! I swear I don't know anything! - Take your hands off me! Disgusting! Why the hell did I marry you? Aren't you the one of those who encourage such cheap things? Only by doing so, did I know how third rated you are! Believe me, Prasad! - Whom do you think you're talking to? My baby shouldn't be here for even second more! No, Prasad! Please! I beg you! Leave him here! Prasad, please leave the baby! - Believe me! Please don't take the baby away from me, Prasad! I swear I didn't do anything, ma! - I know well about you He is doubting me. - Please, don't cry. I'm not such a woman, ma! You haven't done anything wrong! You wouldn't do anything wrong! I'm the one who did wrong! One million! I'll pay you one million! Why didn't you choose modeling? - Welcome to my company! Thamarai, have this juice. - No thanks.. No, it's okay, take - Thank you This is your costume. Get ready and come down. Hey! You go! Why is she sleeping here? - Why is she lying here, Cheta? Thamarai! - Hey, Thamarai! Thamarai! What has happened? Cheta! Something has happened to her! Hey, Suresh! - Wake up, Thamarai What happened to her? - Huh? She is drunk! She is not such a drunkard! He is lying! - She is not such a woman! She is the one who came for money, right? Aren't you also like me? What did you say? - Hit him! I won't leave you! Sophia, go and get the passports! Thamarai! Let's go! Let's leave! - Sofie, are you ready? Cheta, what happened? Why are you hurt? - There's no time for all this! Ma? Ma! Ma! Maa? What happened? Wake up, ma! Don't leave me and go.. I have no one else! Rest in peace.. Here I sing a lullaby, rest in peace My mother dearest! I shall realize myself when you embrace me Who's the lad? - My Son-in-law You brought me up caring for me Her mother, I'm there, right? There is no me without you Let me sing a lullaby and you rest in peace! Rest in peace.. I wish I could stay with you and take care of you.. But I'm helpless! I too live away from my family and stay here with the boys Have this with you. Send for me if you need anything You? - Arjun, listen to me! Why should I listen to you? Shouldn't you have been like a mother? - Arjun! Ask her to get out! - You have spoiled my brother's life! Please don't come back! - Arjun, please listen! Please open the door! Prasad, at least you listen to me. Prasad, Arjun Please open the door! Prasad! You know how our mom took care of you both! But you didn't even come to see her face! It's okay if you don't accept me. Just give me my baby! I haven't cheated on anybody, Prasad. Here I sing a lullaby, rest in peace I won't leave this house without my child! Please give me my child, Prasad! Here I sing a lullaby, rest in peace Rest in peace.. We are supposed to earn our own keep, Thamarai! Don't stay alone, Thamarai Search for a job.. Ma, I'm not coming for work from tomorrow - Why? What happened? I'll finish today's work and go We couldn't come for mother's funeral! Shooting.. There would be no mistake on your part, Thamarai! We tried to stop him from going to the theater - We asked him not to go! But he didn't listen to us! Do you think this happens only to you? This happens to so many girls.. - Shut up! Did he take your baby? I'll take care.. I'll go and talk to Prasad! Let's argue with him about it! We shouldn't leave him just like that. Thamarai? Thamarai! Where has she gone? Thamarai! What are you doing here? Thamarai? Are you drunk? Where did you get this habit from? Would this happen if mom had been there? It's not about that, Prasad! If it had been your sister, would you leave her to suffer? Would you say that she is this baby's mother? It's an unchangeable fact that she is the baby's mother Prasad, think and decide! Anna, I'd been to Thamarai's place She is missing! Anna, poor her! - I'm in no situation to pity anyone! Master! Come, Thamarai.. I heard about your mother. Sorry, Thamarai.. I couldn't come due to shooting.. I was told that you have a baby. Are you drunk?! Why, Thamarai? Mohan Anna confiscated the house And I couldn't find a job. I had nowhere to go.. That's why I came here. Asha! Master asked me to give you this money I heard that you are a good dancer.. Buy yourself some food Do you think you are the only one who is suffering? Every girl child born in this world has a lot to suffer From the day we were born we have been facing all the difficulties I am a woman too.. Do you know how much I have had to face in this society? Even though I wasn't born a woman, I've completely transformed into one! My people took me to Bombay to live I asked them if we wouldn't get a housekeeping job.. They told me we wouldn't be given any job and that we had to beg from shops Or we must beg in trains or traffic signals How are we supposed to beg to a person for money? The very thought made me feel disgusted about my whole birth! Leave out my story, did you think about your mother for a minute? Did you ever think about the condition of the friend who saved you? Leave even that! At least you have been given a chance to give birth. I was born like my dad and I grew like my mother But, I have not been blessed with the gift to give birth to a baby Every mother must bring up her child telling the tales of her miseries in life. The same way, you must live for your child! I would tell even my kind that they are born to be women and how they must live. Promise me that you won't drink and I'll get you your baby! Wasn't there a dancer called Thamarai here? - No idea. Do you know anything about a dancer called Thamarai? She used to live here, but now her whereabouts are unknown What, da? I'll kill you! Why are you following me now? - I wasn't following you. You're walking in the way I'm going, that's all.. Namaste, madam. - Namaste! I've come looking for a cinema dancer named Thamarai I heard that she lives here.. Achcha.. Thamarai! You stand as an entirety O woman! You stand as an entirety Thamarai, someone came in search of you Look around you, O tenderness Who? - I don't know who, I've asked them to wait Look around you, O tenderness There's happiness all around you You've soared up high across the sky O woman! You stand as an entirety How are you, Cheta? I believed that I'd see you someday! That has happened today. I'm very happy This is my daughter Nirmala - Bless you If not for her, I wouldn't have seen you How is Sophia, Cheta? I've been trying to find her too. What happened to her? Sophia has left us all Suresh came to kill you, fearing that we might reach the cops Since you weren't there, he killed Sophia and put the blame on me! It took me a few years to prove my innocence You don't feel much about it.. Sophia is right here with us! This was found in Sophia's room How did you end up here? Right after mom died, everyone left me I had nowhere to go.. When my life was drowned in sorrow and misery, Kanna Anna, Monica, Bakya Akka.. These people saved me There are many people in this world who are searching for their lost lives This woman jumped from a building because of her love failure, lost her consciousness and is spending her life in a wheelchair This woman was deceived by her friends, pushed into drug addiction and used like a plaything! This woman's story is similar to mine After her husband left her, she lost her way and was in depression The only difference is that I've found a better life and she is still in the process The worst of them all is her condition.. Some barbaric men raped her and now her life is a big question mark! What wrong did they do, Cheta? Whom did they cheat? Why should they face this? When questioned, all the blame is put on them.. The fact that even a woman has feelings and a life, is never considered But these women have a place on this Earth, And a life.. This center is to give them that confidence There's a sad story behind each and every woman in this place And there is a man behind each and every sad story! Women are being brought up being taught how to behave with men But men are never being taught how to protect women or behave with them That is why he grows up bad When parents talk wrong things or use bad words in front of children, the children who grasp these things grow up to be the same I haven't brought up my son like that Krishna! - Maa? Come here.. Is this your son? Okay, when I was traveling here in a share auto, a man tried to misbehave When all others ignored, your son smartly taught him a lesson You have brought him up well! Okay, go play.. I'm happy that you came here Keep visiting us often One thing before I go.. You have returned the happiness that these people have lost I want to give you back the happiness that you have lost in your life Appa! (Father) I've told Prasad, all that happened. It's all in your hands now Enduring the pain that chiseling put you through, O stone, you stand as a sculpture Enduring the pain that life put you through, O woman, - O Woman! You stand as an Entirety! You stand as an entirety! Look around you, O tenderness There's happiness all around you You've soared up high across the sky Beep
