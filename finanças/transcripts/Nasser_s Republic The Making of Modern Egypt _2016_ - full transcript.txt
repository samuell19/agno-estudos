(crowd cheering) ¶ In May, 1964, Gamal Abdel Nasser, the President of Egypt, came to Aswan in the south of the country. ¶ He was celebrating the biggest engineering project of its kind in the world, the High Dam. It was the pride of all Egyptians. ¶ ¶ Nasser had freed his country from colonial rule, made Egypt leader of the Arab world, and brought millions out of poverty. (crowd cheering) Egyptians called him Father of the Poor. But some say he offered us bread in exchange for freedom. (dynamite exploding) During his 18 years in power, Nasser unleashed forces that not even he could control. These forces continue to bring people out to the streets, to invoke his legacy or protest against it. (crowd roaring) Many people would attribute all Egyptian problems to Nasser. And many people will say, "If only somebody like Nasser would come back." (crowd chanting) ¶ Ordinary Egyptians feel close to Gamal Abdel Nasser because of his humble origins. ¶ He was born in 1918 in a lower middle class neighborhood in Alexandria where his father worked for the post office. ¶ When he was eight, his mother died and his father quickly remarried, leaving him without a feeling of home. ¶ For the rest of his childhood, he was shuttled from relative to relative, city to city. ¶ Egypt's big cities were bustling. There were the very rich, the very poor, and everyone in between. There were European tourists with Egyptians at their service. There were Muslims, Christians, Jews. As a teenager, Nasser lived for a while in Cairo's old Jewish quarter where rents were cheap. But he found his true home in Egypt's struggle for independence. (yelling in Arabic) ¶ In those years, he participated in many demonstrations. ¶ Though King Farouk was in his palace, and Parliament was in session. Though Egypt had a semblance of democracy. ¶ And a long proud history. ¶ Egypt was not free. It was part of the British Empire. ¶ Egypt's cotton fed Britain's mills. ¶ If there's one thing that can sum up Egypt's nationalism and its confrontation with colonialism, it is the Suez Canal. ¶ Connecting the Mediterranean to the Red Sea, the Canal was the lifeline of the British Empire. ¶ The Suez Canal was a symbol of humiliation and exploitation of Egypt. Since it was open in 1869. Thousands of peasants were dragged from all over the country to work with no money. And literally thousands dug with their bare hands, digging it up and thousands died. The British controlled the canal and all its revenue. ¶ Despite the fact that it was dug by Egyptian hands, passing through Egyptian soil, its proceeds did not end up in Egyptian pockets. The British guarded the canal with 70,000 troops. The hope of everybody was to evacuate the British soldiers from the Suez Canal. I found a piece of paper, a speech by my father when he was 17 years old. "Egypt is in a state of hopeless despair. Who can remove this feeling? Who can stop the imperialists?" He had become an ardent nationalist, placing Egypt above all other political allegiances. "Where is dignity? Where is nationalism? The nation sleeps like men in a cave. Who can awaken these poor creatures who do not even know who they are?" ¶ I was really surprised that he kept this piece of paper. Don't you think so? I mean, he kept it. So, I believe that the political incidents of his youth were really very important and had a big effect on him. ¶ In May, 1948, on Egypt's northern border, the new state of Israel was declared in what had been Palestine. (crowd cheering) For us, it was a very euphoric moment. Although everybody thought that the Arab's would start a war in order to undermine this declaration of the state. ¶ To protect their new country, the Israelis drove nearly three quarters of a million Palestinians into exile. ¶ In Cairo, non-Jews rioted against Jews in Nasser's old neighborhood. There was an enormous sense of Egyptian solidarity with Palestinians. Here we have the Egyptians struggling to achieve independence. And we see what is happening in Palestine as a colonial movement. Nasser had graduated from Egypt's military academy and was now a lieutenant colonel in the Egyptian Army. He had been married for four years and had a young daughter. My father was very keen to have a family. This is something which he really missed. I remember my mother used to clean his buttons on his uniform and I used to help her. One morning I ran out of the house carrying my kit and leaving behind a newspaper announcing the beginning of military operations in Palestine. I was seized with a strange feeling as I raced down the steps, thinking, "So I'm on my way to the front." I wanted to forget altogether what I left behind. All those tears I knew were waiting to fall from my wife's eyes. (train whistle blowing) The British had decided that Egypt doesn't really need an army. So the army went in with no combat experience and it went in with insufficient weapons. Egypt and six other Arab nations sent troops against Israel. (gunfire) At first, the Arabs made gains. But then the Israelis surprised everyone by routing the Arab armies. In search of an explanation, Egyptians blamed their own government. And then there came the big scandal about the king buying rotten weapons for the Egyptian Army. People accused their king and his government of corruption. ¶ For four months, Colonel Nasser's brigade was besieged near Gaza. They refused to surrender. During those long days under siege, we started meeting in trenches and posts. Studying and searching. Though we were in Palestine, we thought only of Egypt and how to deliver it. This was not simply a military defeat. This was a structural political defeat. And that was the lesson that Nasser deduced. I became a revolutionary over many years, but 1948 was the turning point. (crowd yelling) When the war ended, Nasser came home to find Egyptians taking to the streets against a regime they no longer believed in. ¶ Choosing to remain unnoticed, a young officer among many others, Nasser began to think about overthrowing the government. In secret, he gathered around him a small group that called themselves the Free Officers. ¶ My father actually trusted all of the Free Officers. This was a kind of relationship of blood. ¶ They made alliances with groups protesting on the streets. The communists, nationalists, even the fascists. Though Nasser was a nationalist, he was close to the Muslim Brotherhood. (crowd chanting) Formed in 1928, it had millions in its membership and was actively fighting the British. But unlike Nasser, the Brotherhood believed that only Islam could save Egypt. (yelling) ¶ In January, 1952, a mob in downtown Cairo destroyed some 750 buildings associated with Egypt's colonial elite. It was a most unstable political situation. The king was losing hold himself. And it seems that the British Embassy was ceasing to function. ¶ Egyptians were waiting for a revolution, but were unsure who would start it. ¶ When I was a young officer, the country was realizing that something should happen to the extent that when we used to go in the streets with our military uniform, people telling us, "Why don't you move?" ¶ In the early hours of July 23, 1952, Nasser took an enormous risk. ¶ Realizing the Free Officers were on the verge of being arrested, he gave orders to move immediately against the king. He and his friends had only a few hours to plan their move. (tank rumbling) I was charged with going to the palace of the king and if there's any resistance, I deal with it. Fortunately, the royal guard gave up immediately when we go, so it was done very peacefully. We were all taken by surprise. We switched on the radio, we learned that there is a coup. That the army has taken over-- how marvelous. There was almost no bloodshed. The Free Officers allowed the king to go safely into exile. And promised to restore order. For these reasons, the British agreed not to intervene. They recognized the new government and withdrew to their barracks near the Suez Canal. Nasser was 34-- no one even knew his name. Overnight, he and his comrades had become responsible for their country. To gain the peoples confidence, they presented a famous general, Muhammad Naguib, as Egypt's first president. There were two things Nasser was very much keen to realize. First, complete independence. The second thing is the dignity of the country. The American Embassy in Cairo was in favor of the new government. Ambassador Caffrey dealt with General Naguib while his young assistant got to know the younger men. I served in the embassy as a fairly junior foreign service officer. My connection told me that Nasser and several of the other leading members of the group would be happy to come and have hot dogs with us at our apartment. This was an occasion to just kind of get to know "the boys" as we tended to call them. These boys would work together for years. Zakaria Mohieddine set up Egypt's new state security service. ¶ Anwar Sadat became Egypt's president after Nasser's death. Abdel Hakim Amer, Nasser's closest friend, was put in charge of the armed forces. We found Nasser and his close associates to be very attractive, congenial, intelligent, and dedicated human beings. Nasser wanted to bring Egypt into the modern world. (cheering) We have to work twice as fast. Once to make up for a hundred years of backwardness. And once to provide work for the 350,000 people born to us each year. ¶ Britain had left Egypt with an economy that was nearly feudal. With peasants working the agricultural estates owned by the aristocracy. Poverty, illiteracy, and disease, which was a good summary of what was the situation. ¶ The first thing the Free Officers did was reform the ownership of agricultural land. ¶ They took some acreage away from the owners of the great estates and gave it to the peasants, who actually farmed it. ¶ Those who had their land taken, they hated him with a vengeance. And, and one of the things I remember them complaining about is how he had made these peasants be able to talk back to their masters. (cheering) The wealthy land owners opposed land reform and they controlled the political parties. We needed unity, but found dissention. The word "I" was on every tongue. We had to improvise. They marginalized the aristocracy by convicting some of them of corruption. And they set up a single party controlled by the state. They were determined to protect their revolution. ¶ The Free Officers had panicked at the threat of disorder. But their crackdown set a pattern for their regime. Change, no matter how progressive, had to come from the top. ¶ In 1954, Nasser sidelined Muhammad Naguib and took control of the presidency, consolidating power in his own hands. As Egypt's new leader, Nasser moved into a modern house on an army compound where he would live for the rest of his life. When we moved from our flat, I was only six, but I still remember. Of course, for us this house was very big. There was a lot of light in the house. Inside and outside in the garden. Of course now I understand this is for security, but still, for us this was something fascinating. A big change. ¶ For the first time, Nasser was in the spotlight. His first goal was to remove all British troops from the Suez Canal. If no satisfactory solution appears possible, what will be your next step? Well, as for our next step, is a secret which I can not reveal. ¶ In negotiations, he let the British keep the revenue from the canal. In exchange, the British evacuated all their troops from Egyptian soil. For the first time in 70 years, the British were gone. ¶ Two weeks after signing the treaty with the British, there was a plot to assassinate him in Manshia Square in Alexandria. (gunshots) Eight shots were fired. A member of the secret military wing of the Muslim Brotherhood was quickly arrested and sentenced to death. The Brotherhood had realized that Nasser, the nationalist, would never agree to an Islamic state. ¶ ¶ For the rest of his life, Nasser tried to break the Brotherhood. He closed their businesses and sent them to prison, where many were tortured. Among those imprisoned for many years, was Sayyid Qutb a prominent Muslim intellectual. ¶ The Muslim Brotherhood came out of decades in prison with a deep sense of mistrust, not only of the Egyptian state, but of politics. It was clear to all that the nationalist agenda and the Islamist one were irreconcilable. ¶ (street noises) Nasser had a vision and approach which was about modernity. And Nasser delivered. He delivered land, he delivered factories, he delivered free education, he delivered this so called popular housing. Nearly 80 percent of Egyptians were illiterate. Nasser built a school a day. Nasser came and built schools to such an extent he reached the smallest village. He educated girls. He made education free through university. And he guaranteed government employment for all graduates. He gave women the vote. He was very conscious and very sensitive to peoples sense that they were part of this revolution and they were part of this important moment in change. ¶ Nasser was a very ambitious man. He had great hopes for a new Egypt. He wanted Egypt to become self-sufficient in all kinds of goods. From the needle to the rocket. ¶ His greatest ambition was to build a new hydroelectric dam in Aswan. ¶ A dam so monumental it could control the ebb and flow of the Nile all through Egypt, opening up millions of new acres to cultivation, providing light to thousands of villages still in darkness, and industrializing Egypt. ¶ The High Dam would be the grandest project of its kind in the world. A symbol of the new Egypt. And a source of pride for every Egyptian. ¶ To develop Egypt, Nasser needed foreign aid. He turned first to the United States. I believe that the well-being of the peoples of the Middle East requires the nations of that region to build up and strengthen their economies and their institutions. But the United States was engaged in a much bigger game, the cold war against the Soviet Union. ¶ The two super powers saw themselves as global enemies. ¶ John Foster Dulles, the American Secretary of State wasn't going to give Nasser aid without getting something in return. ¶ As the super powers divided up the world, Dulles was determined to keep the Soviets out of the Middle East. He wanted Egypt to join a regional alliance that would block the Soviet Union from Saudi oil fields and the Suez Canal. ¶ People described Dulles as having something called pactomania. We'll have an alliance here and an alliance here and an alliance here. And the Soviet Union would be contained. (propellers whirring) Nasser read the map differently. He saw Egypt surrounded by Arab and African nations struggling to free themselves from the colonial powers with a hostile Israel to his north. For him, the Soviet Union was not the threat. And he refused to sign Dulles's pact. Egypt is doing its best to protect its interests from the cold war which is going now between East and West. He needed another way. He traveled to Indonesia to explore the possibilities of neutrality. The Bandung Conference opened a new world to him. Nasser was meeting with Nehru and Tito and Zhou Enlai, all the great leaders and saying we are neither with the West nor with the East. Marvelous. They were all wrestling with the same problem, how to get money for development from the super powers without becoming the pawn of either one. He would attempt to remain neutral by obtaining aid from both sides. He was able to get loans from the Russians to build his army. And he turned to the Americans for aid to build the High Dam. But for Dulles, neutrality was a suspect stance. He wanted countries to line up with the United States and if they didn't, he increasingly as time went on, saw them as adversaries. So Dulles rejected Nasser's request for aid to build the High Dam. And does it fairly abruptly. He calls the Egyptian ambassador in and he said, the offer is off the table. It was a kind of confrontational American move towards the Egyptians and Nasser responds in kind. "You think you can push me around, I can push back." Shelving the project was impossible. So the funds had to be raised. ¶ As he had done the night of the coup, he decided to make a bold move. He would nationalize the Suez Canal Company on to buy Britain and France. Egypt would keep the canal's massive revenue for itself. ¶ Nationalizing the Suez Canal took us all by surprise. (crowd cheering) In July, 1956, on the fourth anniversary of the revolution, he made the announcement. He said, "While I'm talking to you now..." Honestly, until today when I hear, "In the name of the nation, I declare the nationalization of the Suez Canal," as an Egyptian, still my, you know, the hairs can feel them standing. All Egyptians knew that nationalizing the canal was dangerous. A direct challenge to Britain. But they were behind Nasser anyway. (cheering) It meant expression of dignity. Settling old accounts and starting to be free. Britain's prime minister, Anthony Eden, took the nationalization as a cause for war. We all know this is how fascist governments behave. And we all remember only too well what the cost can be in giving in to fascism. I was waiting for reaction from Britain, but I was surprised by the amount of reaction. ¶ Over the next months, there was intensive diplomacy to stave off war. Nasser was willing to guarantee passage for ships of all nations. But he was not willing to give up control of the canal. ¶ They started training us for fighting. And the volunteers were immense. Nasser was optimistic. His closest friend, Abdel Hakim Amer was building the Egyptian Army with Soviet weapons. And as the months passed and no attack came, Nasser thought he had managed to avoid war. But what nobody knew was that Britain, France, and Israel had made a secret plan. The idea sprang from French and Israelis with the British that they can create a coalition to you know, to undermine not only the revolution regime but Nasser, to topple Nasser. On October 29, 1956, the Israelis took the Egyptians by surprise. (bomb exploding) Their army quickly overran the Sinai. A few days later, the British and the French invaded. The Suez War happened when I was only ten. We realized the attack of the British and the French through planes just at the back of our house, and our father went up to see, "What's this?" And then, he knew that the attack started. The British and the French occupied the Canal Zone. In Cairo, Nasser remained defiant. Our slogan is, "We will fight." We will fight and we will not surrender. Then, with Egypt occupied and its army defeated, the Cold War itself came to Nasser's rescue. The nightmare of the Cold War was that a local conflict might escalate and would draw in intervention from one superpower, which would draw in the other, and that, at some point, somebody would say that the only way we can dominate is to resort to nuclear weapons. In Moscow, Premier Khrushchev threatened to intervene on Egypt's behalf. At this moment, the situation is somber. In Washington, President Eisenhower stepped in and forced the French and British to withdraw. We believe these actions to have been taken in error, for we do not accept the use of force as a wise or proper instrument of the settlement of international disputes. ¶ With the Suez War, Nasser had turned a military defeat into a huge diplomatic victory. He got rid of the British once and for all. I wish my successor all good fortune, and Godspeed to you all. Goodbye. One should not minimize it. He was the first leader to defeat...defeat Britain since Britain occupied Egypt in 1882. Nobody did it. ¶ The whole Arab would had watched Nasser take on Britain, France, and Israel, and win. All this allowed third world countries like us to play. ¶ And we played and Nasser played. ¶ ¶ Sometimes, they called him, "The Lion of Africa," because he's the one who faced that colonialists. We were able to give offices to all the liberation movements in Cairo, so we were held all over Africa. During his years in power, Nasser aided and inspired Arabs and Africans who rose up against colonialism. Suez gave confidence to many countries and I think Suez helped many of the African countries to be sure of themselves and insist about independence. ¶ Very vivid memory of my childhood is us standing in the balcony waiting for Nasser's motorcade to pass, and then having the sense that he's looking right at you because he would be, you know, looking at the balconies, looking at the people in the street. ¶ Unlike these days, it was always an open car. ¶ It was really an Egypt that was, more or less, defined by Nasser, from Abdel Halim Hafez... (singing in foreign language) ...to Umm Kulthum... (singing in foreign language) ...to the cinema of the time, the music of the time. And the whole panorama of our heroes, Tito and Nehru and Kwame Nkrumah, this pantheon to which Nasser was central in our childhood imagination. ¶ Nasser reclaimed Egypt for the Egyptians. ¶ To do so, he purged it of its European influence. ¶ From '56 onwards, Nasser nationalized the foreign companies, which meant that many foreigners had to leave. Many of these so-called foreigners were really Egyptians of European origin. ¶ Ultimately, it emptied Egypt of, what I think, was a very precious part of Egyptian culture, which is the Jews, the Greeks, the Armenians, that had lived here for centuries. ¶ At the time, we welcomed all these mergers as a natural reaction to a long period of colonialists. We have to get things back into our own hands. ¶ When Arabs looked at the map, they saw a world that had been united for more than six centuries defeated and carved up by Europeans. ¶ When they looked at Nasser, they saw a leader who could reunite them. ¶ The Kuwaitis, the Lebanese, the Jordanians, the city officials, they thought, "How marvelous it would be if we unite in one single state? What a great nation we would become in a matter of years!" ¶ At the beginning of 1958, Shukri al-Quwatli, the President of Syria, came to Cairo with an enormous request: To save Syria from impending civil war, Syria and Egypt must become one nation under Nasser's leadership. ¶ But Nasser was afraid that this was coming too early. We should take some time before they know each other more and so on. The pressure was so strong from the Syrians. ¶ So, Nasser took the risk and agreed to union with Syria. ¶ The concept of Pan-Arab is aroused. Immense emotion. Really great emotions. We were all fresh, optimistic. The world was different and what seems impossible now seemed very possible then. ¶ The United Arab Republic was the largest republic in the Middle East. Nasser was now someone neither superpower could ignore. The Americans gave him food aid: Wheat and edible oil and tea and loans at very low interest rate. And the Soviet Union financed the High Dam as well as many industries. In 1960, with his prestige at an all-time high, Nasser was, at last, able to begin work on the project for which he had risked war: The High Dam at Aswan. The High Dam signaled Egypt's daring and ambition. For the next four years, 30,000 men worked around the clock to build the dam and dig a bed for one of the largest manmade lakes in the world. ¶ I remember the songs from my childhood. We used to sing that while the High Dam and the country's efforts were building the High Dam. It said, "We are going to build," and we did build. ¶ On May 14th, 1964, Nasser brought Premier Nikita Khrushchev to Aswan to celebrate the moment that Soviet funds had paid for. In a triumph of engineering, modern Egypt became possible. As water filled the new Lake Nasser, ancient farmlands of the Nubians were drowned forever. ¶ Nasser was building an Arab world for all to see, but there were cracks in its foundation. The first cost was the union with Syria. ¶ Syria was a poor country and Nasser wanted to develop it. As he had done in Egypt, he controlled the process himself. ¶ He left his friend, Abdel-Hakim Amer, in Damascus to carry out his agenda. ¶ In 1961, after only three years of union, a group of business and army leaders rebelled. ¶ Amer was not aware of what's happening around him. There was a sort of a coup d'état. And it was planned by Syrians who are wealthy in his office. ¶ My father did not spend a lot of time with us, but we had always lunched together. He never talked to us about politics during lunch, except if something happens at the moment; a piece of paper is brought to him and he... something happens. Syria withdrew from the union with Egypt. He called Amer home but did not dismiss him. By now, Amer had established his own power base within the army. Nasser concluded it would be too dangerous to challenge him. Amer was able to isolate Nasser from the army completely. The Syrian coup revealed something else: A deep division among the Arabs. The coup had been bankrolled by Saudi Arabia. The Saudi monarchy was challenging Nasser's leadership of the Arab world. ¶ Their challenge played out in Yemen. ¶ Bordering on Saudi Arabia, it was locked in civil war. ¶ Yemen's king, backed by the Saudis, was fighting a group of colonels who wanted to set up a Nasserist republic. ¶ The colonels asked Nasser for aid. ¶ ¶ Over the next six years, Nasser sent as many as 70,000 troops to Yemen. ¶ ¶ The Yemen War also affected our economy because it cost Egypt a lot of money. As Nasser's economic needs grew, so did his need for funds. He nationalized many companies, which, I believe, was a very, very big mistake he did. The Egyptian state was now more responsible than ever for the economy. Nasser had promised employment and he kept his promise. The ministries started to interfere in the management of the companies. To fight unemployment, the government gave instructions to appoint a certain number of workers in the company. So, as the public sector companies became overloaded with workers they don't need, this led them to make losses, of course. ¶ ¶ ¶ Nasser got quite worried and frightened. He started to tighten his grip. The police state started to grow very obvious. ¶ Censorship, surveillance, and imprisonment increased. ¶ ¶ Outwardly, Nasser projected an image of strength. His large army was now well-equipped with Soviet weapons. By 1967, the Palestinians and the Syrians thought Nasser was ready to take on Israel. The border between Israel and Egypt was 11 years quiet, no walls, but the Syrian border was hot all the '60s. Trouble and death in the Middle East; a ground and air battle heavily damages Tiberius on the Israeli-Syrian border. Syria intensified its border attacks, intending to draw Nasser in. The fighting erupted quickly when Syrians allegedly fired on Israeli farmers operating tractors. Israel retaliated against Syria with force, threatening to topple the regime. Nasser could not avoid coming to Syria's aid. So, Nasser did everything short of war. He moved troops into the Sinai, he closed the Gulf of Aqaba to Israeli ships. The Israelis saw this escalation as a threat to their nation. Nasser was gambling that the superpowers would once again intervene. But the Americans were not as focused on the region as they had been during the Suez War; President Johnson was as mired in his own war as Nasser was in Yemen. Johnson was very, very preoccupied with Vietnam, and, by the time he noticed the Middle East was getting very dangerous, he was already beginning to spiral toward the point of no return. And this time, the Soviet Union would not intervene on his behalf either. I believe that Nasser overestimated how much he was manipulating international politics and that was really the killing of Nasser. On June 5th, 1967, Israel attacked Egypt, then Jordan and Syria. ¶ As Israel took more territory, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians fled into neighboring countries. ¶ Israel's territorial gain was the Arabs' loss. The region was reconfigured and destabilized. ¶ Nobody expected that he's going to be destroyed in such a massive quick, rapid, instant way. Nobody, nobody. ¶ Israelis call it The Six Day War. For Arabs, it was a catastrophe. ¶ The defeat of June '67 was the formative experience of my generation. It's very difficult to describe it now because it just came out of-- It was...it was... lightning in a blue sky. You get something that's settled in not six days, but six hours. Egyptian soldiers are running away. They're not fighting, they're running, without their weapons, without their helmets. You had Israeli soldiers swimming in the Suez Canal. The depth of the humiliation was massive. It really was...was massive. People, young and old, people were crying on the streets. It meant that all what we had been hearing over the years about building military power in Egypt is false. You were deceiving us. On the night of June 9th, Nasser addressed the nation. This is not popularity or political support. This is, "For goodness sake, find a way out for us, since you have led us to this mess!" ¶ His country was defeated, his people had been humiliated, and, with Israeli troops in the Sinai, Egypt was once again occupied by foreigners. ¶ Nasser decided to stay on and rebuild his country. ¶ Amer wanted to return back to being head of the army. My father refused. And then, there was a clash between them. ¶ Nasser's men were able to place Amer under house arrest...where he took poison. ¶ I saw President Nasser after Amer committed suicide. Still, at this time, he was still having the affection for Amer. ¶ "I'm like a man walking in a desert, surrounded by shifting sands. With each new step, I have no idea whether I'll be swallowed up or find the right path." ¶ My father, after the defeat, for two or three months, he didn't smile. I never saw him smile. ¶ The defeat inspired a new generation to demand a role in the direction of their country. This is the time where I became, and a lot of my generation became, politically active. It was no so much deny the Nasserist project as feeling that the Nasserist project was betrayed, that it was let down, that it was up to us to complete and to take it further than even Nasser had envisaged. When he first took power, Nasser had chosen revolution over democracy. Now, he promised democracy as well. He reaffirmed his promise in the factory town of Kafr el-Dawwar. ¶ It was here, in the first weeks of the revolution, that three officers had punished workers for their spontaneous strike. ¶ But that is not what the people of Kafr el-Dawwar cared about. ¶ ¶ The newsreel captured Nasser's ecstatic reception in Kafr el-Dawwar, but there would be no coverage of the angry demonstrations months later when young people realized that they still had no voice. ¶ ¶ He did not deliver on the promise, not because he didn't want to, but because he couldn't. The system he put in place for so many years, the erosion of politics, not only institutionally, but psychologically, was so deep that it was very difficult to have this U-turn. When Nasser realized this in 1967-68, it was just too late for him. ¶ My father had his first heart attack in September, 1969. ¶ Almost exactly a year later, he was called from his vacation to negotiate an end to a bloody civil war between the Palestinians and the Jordanians. ¶ It was very difficult, and this effort, his heart could not stand. ¶ That afternoon, he had another heart attack. ¶ It was a major heart attack and he didn't survive. He was only 52 years old. ¶ My father never said anything about his accomplishments. ¶ I believe he left our world without accomplishing what he really wanted. ¶ ¶ Peasants came in from the countryside. More than five million people were on the streets of Cairo that day. For me, it was a very conflicted feeling because, ideologically and politically you felt you have to reject Abdel Nasser, but, somehow, emotionally, there was this tie. You were always kind of fighting against yourself. ¶ ¶ Egyptians confront Nasser's legacy at every turn. ¶ They have risen up against authoritarian rule, but the military has remained fundamentally in power. ¶ The Muslim Brotherhood and the State remain unreconciled. ¶ But no Egyptian leader since Gamal Abdel Nasser has seriously addressed the needs of the poor... and protesters' chants still echo his words. ¶ I thought we had buried him. It turns out he's still alive. ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶
