Do you have a name for it? I like to call him the weapon of "ass" destruction. I just thought, "Jesus Christ, it's going to kill me." Celebrated from poetry to porn... Size really matters in my line of work. ...bigger is often seen as better. I'm still always on the look for the next big one that might tick all my boxes. There's such a thing as too big. But, for some, it's not always a blessing. It's either don't go out or someone stares at your cock, really. Instead, it can even be a curse... People just want your attention because of your penis, not because of who you are. I feel like they're looking at me as if, you know, "You should be ashamed of that." ...driving some to consider taking extreme action... Most people are looking for penile enlargement, and you're looking the opposite. I have a big, a big penis. ...when size becomes an obsession... That was like an 11-incher. BBC isn't the broadcasting company. It stands for Big Black Cock. I got offered 400 quid for someone to set me up once. ...and a humiliation. It really makes you feel like, you know, less of a human. You're always worried. Is it big enough? What they want is clearly below the waistline. They don't care about what's up here. All right, let's just do a little warm up around the goals, then. Back to a light jog, then! I'm 35. Ancl my cock is about 9.4 inches erect. They are a bit tight, I know. Don't worry about it. Football coach Scott is single and looking for love, but his mates won't stop teasing him for his big penis. Good session, lads! I've been joked about quite a lot, about my click, mainly in the changing rooms. Scottie, how is it looking? All right, mate! You know, guys are always talking about it. Scottie, are you going to make it dance? They're the ones who objectify me and have, obviously, a bit of a laugh. It is what it is, at the end of the clay. Do you think they're envious? I think 100%, they're envious. That's why they talk about it all the time. That's why they take pictures. That's why they're always asking questions. First thing they thought was he looks like an ageing porn star. Yeah. Ancl that's why, people I know just said that straight away. I generally take it in good humour. It can be quite a laugh and I don't mind it at times, but it gets to a point where it can get a bit, you know, a bit tedious. But it's not just the lads that are in the know. Word has spread around town. Randomly, I got a message saying, "Send a pic, the girls want to see it. "My friend's gift." So I just said, "How many do you want?" So I've literally pulled four pictures off the group chat, the video we've clone. They couldn't believe it. You're getting a reputation. It's on my phone and I think every single person has seen your dick. Seriously? Oh, God! They're a good bunch of lads, but, well, I think it can affect my dating life around this area because a lot of people know about it. When you quote the size, do you use metric or imperial? It's normally in inches. It's weird when you start measuring stuff in Scott's length! 15 Scott metres. Is this how it's going to be, then, in future? How does that feel to be in there just having the piss taken out of you like now? Same as usual, really. You know, when you've got your mates speaking about you and want to show it to their mates, especially people that I don't really know, it does make you feel like people just want your attention because of your penis, not because of who you are. My favourite word for a penis has to be schlong because there's so much... So much length to it. Do you know what I mean? Schlong. Like, I'm all about that. ARCHIVE: The adolescent boy has other problems, too. I'm talking about his problems in growth and development, which can be as disturbing to him as his sex pressures. I used to go to a school where we had to go swimming in the bare. I was so embarrassed about the size of my penis that I used to dread the clays we had to go swimming. Where every boy should realise that the size of his genital organs has nothing to do with fertility or his capacity as a male. So the average length of a penis is just over five inches long, and that's through many countries and many, many studies. Most men believe penises are longer than that. Our survey of 2,000 people reveals that nearly half of British men wish their penis was bigger. If we're looking at a measurement like eight inches, probably well under 1 % of men in the world have a penis that long. And for those 1 %, life can sometimes be a complete nightmare. I've had people walk past me, I've crossed paths with people in the street, and they kind of, like, stare at you and look at me in a way, like, you know, "Why have you got that on display?" Or, "Why, why... Why would you have that?" It's kind of like, nearly as if I feel like they're looking at me as if, you know, "You should be ashamed of that. "Do something about that." I've got no choice because you can kind of see it through whatever. It's either don't go out or someone stares at your cock, really. 22-year-old Joe can't hide his problem. He suffers daily abuse due to his size. We usually have a tally to see how many people looked. Like, just back there, someone was staring. I usually wear underwear that's got like a pouch in the front because if you try and push it down, you get like a cock hamburger with a ball either side. I was about 14. I was playing football and then one of my mates went to my other mates and just went, "Have you seen? "That thing is despicable!" And then it just started as a whole rumour around the school about how big it was. I was in the showers and was like, "Oh, OK. "Yes, it is." It's about nine and a half now and I'm 5'6". So that's 66 inches. So it's like nearly a 12th of my height. The scaling is off, quite off. It's thicker than my forearm. It's about seven around. I can get my hand around my wrist quite easily, but I can't get my hand around my own dick. It's not the best look in the world. Joe needs to buy special underwear, costing him over Â£200 per year. These are the ones where, if I take more than ten steps, it's fallen out the end. Yeah. Even getting dressed, balls to one side, cock to the other, finding the perfect sort of place to put it. I have to think of my thigh-to-cock ratio. This is essentially, it's got an extra pouch. It's basically for people who have big dicks and it's the only ones I've got that properly sort of fit everything in. The issue is because I'm quite a shower, people just automatically presume that I've got a boner, because, like, I can't tuck it round the side. Despite Joe's special pants, he still can't hide his bulge. I went for this interview and I thought the interview went really well, but suit trousers are well-fitting, very tight. The response I got was, "You're not going to get the job. We thought you were a good candidate, "but we thought there was inappropriate behaviour happening." They thought I had an erection throughout this whole interview and they were very much, like, "Your attire wasn't right." They clearly meant, you know, "We could see your dick." Being very well-endowed isn't always what it's cracked up to be, so be careful what you wish for. I remember the first time I saw a massive penis. I was in my late teens and I just thought, "Jesus Christ, it's going to kill me." There's no way that some magic trick, this is going to happen. That was like an 11-incher and it was bloody hell. That was... There's such a thing as too big. I think men are obsessed with their penis sizes. It's because, maybe it's something ingrained from their childhood. You know, they keep talking about it. It's sort of something relayed to them when they're children and they're just like, "Oh, OK, if I have a big penis, "then I am literally a hot guy "who's going to be desirable to all women," and they don't understand there's more to it. There's definitely more to it because a big penis is just there, but you need to know how to swing it. Our survey also found a third of men believe a larger phallus creates better sexual satisfaction. Only one in four women agree... ...but there's always an exception. So I'm a size queen. So that basically means that I prefer to have sex with guys that have above average or very huge penises. Eight inches and above would be making it worth my while, I think. How big are you, tell me? Above average, I'm like seven and a half inches. But I get most people with my girth, which is seven inches. So... But I'm still always on the look for the next big one that might tick all my boxes. Bonnie and her partner, Tommy, have been together for seven years. What do you think about this one? They're now taking their sex life on fine and Bonnie is looking to engage with the most generously endowed guys in the country. Big-dick energy. What do you think? We've always filmed our sex life since the first time we met. Filmed our first sex tape on the first night. Yeah, I was kind of like, "Oh, this is a guy "that I can be completely honest with." Nothing that I said to him in the bedroom over that weekend was, like, shocking to him. No, I was actively encouraging. Yeah. Actually, I've got someone else. Yeah? Looking at his Twitter. He's ticking the size-queen box, that's for sure. That is a big click. THEY LAUGH I'm measuring me cock, it's ten and a half inches from the base to the tip. So this really matters in my line of work. Ex-plumber Andy Lee is making his impressive love muscle work for him. With over 25,000 followers, he's now raking it in as an adult performer. I've seen a guy in a gym and he saw me in the changing rooms and, "Jesus, that's a big old cock." He said, "Would you ever think about doing porn?" I was like, "|'ll do it. I don't care." There's 21 comments on this one. "Jesus, look at Bearkin." "So big, Daddy." So there's a photo of me here with my cock in my hand and a sledgehammer dressed in work gear. So it looks like demolition, tool in each hand, laying pipes, smashing doors and filling cracks. So I just got a message off this couple, Bonnie and Tommy. I've seen some of their stuff before. I've seen some of their TikTok videos and stuff. They look pretty cool. Bonnie comes across as, like, a cock destroyer, hopefully arrange something for this week. Then we can organise a video and we can fuck hard. It's made me a lot of the focus of attention. Often my reputation has preceded me in terms of my size. 39-year-old Cambridge graduate Matt hasn't been able to hold down a relationship as a result of his ten-and-a-half inch penis. His previous attempts to find a partner online have left him feeling fetishized. I'm not an attention seeker, I'm not an extrovert. I'm not a particularly social person. Any attention I get because of my size, you know, unless it's from the right person, then I'm generally not interested in it. I always have the issue that people will think you're aroused when you're not in a regular swimming pool. Ancl I'm always quite a conservative and considerate guy. So I try to make sure if I do feel the need to cast off the shackles of the usual nine to five, I can go somewhere a bit more peaceful. Being well-endowed gets you attention. It doesn't get you affection. Women are very curious. It doesn't mean they're going to suddenly fall in love with you. If anything, it's more of a handicap to actually getting a relationship because it's something you can't really bring up in the courtship process. If you bring it up, you're a bit sleazy. Ancl if you don't bring it up, then it causes complications. But really, you want a nice compromise between someone who likes you for your mind and for your body. But it's very hard to get that perfect match. Generally, I'll use these condoms. They are the biggest on the market. These are supposedly about nine and a half inches around, so it doesn't cover everything. For comparison, here is a regular-sized condom. I've been light-headed before. Certainly at my most engorged, it can be difficult to concentrate. Matt has felt objectified in the past and his penis can attract the wrong kind of interest. There's one girl who made a replica of my erect penis. Ancl then, next clay, ghosted me, left me without any warning. Most baffled I've been. Maybe not the most charming person in the universe, but it still hurts when what they want is clearly below the waistline. They don't care about what's up here. It's very difficult to get your self-esteem when you get that level of rejection. Matt's extreme size has led him to take drastic measures. He's considering a rare and extremely complicated surgery. I've always wondered whether it would be a good idea to have a reduction. It could help if I could lose three or four inches and be fine, then, I don't see why I wouldn't consider it. So this is the kit that you basically make a replica of your own penis. Showerjoe is unable to hide his trouser torpedo but has found a way to tackle the attention through art. Well, I'm making the mould because, well, I'm an artist and everyone talks about my cock constantly. It's everywhere. Why not make an art piece out of it? A sculpture? Let's do something fun. This is disgusting. Does it feel really weird? It is horrible. I'm... I'm going to use it as decoration, no doubt. Or someone can have it as a birthday present. It's all dry. Is that a good representation of you, would you say? Yeah, that's pretty much identical. Not actually being attached to me, it's weird actually feeling the scale of it. So, yeah, it's actually come out pretty decent. There's been a lot of times where people talk to me kind of just like, "Oh, you've got a massive cock. "I kind of want to try that. "Let's just fuck it. "Let's just go." But a couple of times where people have been like, "Nah, like, you're a nice guy, "but we won't have sex in case I die." My mates specifically think it's hilarious on birthdays, anything, is to just send me cards with pictures of my cock on. Every birthday, I'm inundated with, like, 40 cards or something just at a party, drunk boner. They're like, "Ha, you're in the shower," photo. Ancl then that was bad because I was sending nudes on Snapchat and accidentally sent it to our... Sent it to our group chat. So about 30 notifications of screens hot, screens hot, screens hot, screens hot. The level of subtlety in a Cockney friendship group is they're like, you know what? just reemphasise the point. Joe has decided to surprise his friends with his new masterpiece, which he's taking down the pub. I hope they're not horrified or traumatised. Yeah, that's my click! That! Oh, my gosh. Because you can't look away from it. Our survey reveals that one third of the population have problems with penis size in the bedroom. And this affects women more than men. Yeah, it's the sort of thing, especially when I was younger, and, you know, first losing virginity, that sort of thing. People who I was hooking up with, they'd never seen a cock before, so we'd have sex and then they'd be, like, "ls sex meant to hurt like that?" Ancl I was like, "Oh, I hope not. Oh, no." But because I was 15, 16, I also didn't know. So I was like, "Oh, this is just... This is just normal click." All these poor people. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Honest, I never knew that I had a big click. And, obviously, me being very young and not knowing about sex, but when you're very new to the gay world, I feel like everything is quite scary. So I started seeing this guy. The lights were off and we were fucking and it was good. It was OK. It was just very wet, like, everywhere. So I turned the light on and there was just blood everywhere. It was... It was bad. I just remember sitting there, click in hand in the bath, covered in blood, crying, like... Uh-uh-uh! Ancl he's like, "It's normal. It's fine." I'm like, "It's not fucking normal." I never had sex for a year after that. Sometimes you do get a bit of guilt. It is a very harsh thing to expect someone to be able to take... "all of you, or take your entire limb, especially if you know that someone's struggling to take it and still trying to take it and just, like, in pure pain. If you... If I put myself in that situation, I wouldn't want that to be me. I have had an experience with a big penis. So as I moved the pubic hair, and I saw the big penis hanging out, I'm just like, "Oh, my God, I am tiny. I'm not going to be able to handle this." So you didn't do it? You didn't go there? No, I didn't, because it was a little intimidating for me. Ancl it was really big. Really, really big! So I'm just hoping that he... ...lives up to my expectations, from everything that I've seen on his Twitter. Size queen Bonnie and partner Tommy are meeting up for a threesome with Big Boy Andy Lee. Andy is ten and a half inches erect, double the size of an average penis. But even he's having doubts. To be honest, I am a bit nervous today. I'm not normally, but today I'm a little bit nervous, you know. Why are you nervous today, do you think? What if I don't perform? What if I took my click and she was like, "Oh, it's not actually that big"? She seems like a lovely girl. She's very attractive, so... Ancl I'm sure Tommy is going to be a great side man. OK, then. A recent survey found that... ...in the last year. Was she impressed by...the size? She was impressed by it, yeah. She was happy with that? Yeah, she seemed very happy! She seemed very, very happy. So... Bonnie's appetite for larger sized men means she's always looking for the next big thing. Continue to look for more cos I'm greedy like that. How does that make you feel? Like, as a guy, you're always worried, "Is it big enough?" Sure, there's guys with much bigger clicks in me that are still, like, "Is it big enough? Is it big enough?" I think it's, like... It's a guy thing, innit? I'm not sorry about saying that I want...guys that have got big clicks. No. No. just saying what you, innit. just say what I want. Plenty of men say what they want and... "I get it all the time", or, like... "Your boobs aren't big enough..." I think women's bodies are constantly fetishised and men definitely don't get it to the same degree as what a woman does. You cannae control your anatomy... No. ..which I suppose is me being a bit contradictory, like, a guy can't control his anatomy and what size his click is, but... Mm-hm. I think, for guys, it's a really... It's a touchy subject. It's a touchy subject, yeah. Doesn't matter who you are. I appreciate that, but then, what I would say is like, do some inner work on your ego, like... Scott is looking for love, but has previously had problems with intimacy due to his size. There's been a couple of times where we've been dating for a while, and then, when it gets to the sex, that's when things struggle. You know, you try and you try, and keep trying and... HE STUTTERS You know, till it works, but it just doesn't. Tonight, he's going on a date with Melina, who doesn't know about his size, which means that Scott can break the news himself. It's not something I normally reveal on the first date, but I think I'm at that point in my life now where I don't wanna to mess around, I wanna get things right and get things out in the open. Applying...something that's good for the shaft. It's a sort of penile moisturiser, so I do this quite regularly, to be honest. It just feels... just feels good. You look great. Thank you, you too. Cheers. Cheers! Great to...see you. Thanks for inviting me out tonight. My pleasure. Great to see you, too. What are you doing now? I am going into property development. Oh, are you? With the evening going well, Scott decides to flag up what's on his mind. So partly, you know... Struggle of... For...dating... If I'm... If I'm being completely honest, is that... I have a... I have a... I have...a big... A big penis. Oh, OK. So... No, no, in all seriousness... So, for example, if I'm dating somebody, and it goes further and then they see it and then, like, "Oh, I guess it'll be a problem, then," or... Ancl it causes problems. And it's just like, well, maybe that should have been mentioned before. Mm-hm... Well, thank you for sharing that with me. It might not just be a problem for me, it could also be a problem for...women who maybe can't accept the size as well. Mm-hm. Ancl the fact that it might upset you, that you can't handle it and... I don't mean "you" specifically, but... I know what you're saying - females in general you're interested in romantically. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think we connected really well cos she was able to have that conversation with me and I felt like, "Wow, that's something different... "Something I've really been able to talk about that before, so... It just went really well and we were laughing... I'd say there's a bit of a connection there, yeah. It's not a topic that you'd necessarily bring up with... "people, like... I mean, if I was to bring up elements of my private anatomy, it is quite private, isn't it? But I thought if he thought that things could progress romantically, it's an important thing to bring up. It's just hard to know, really, what would happen! But never say never. Well, yeah, as I say, never say never. So are you going to ask her on another date? SCOTT LAUGHS Am I going to ask her on another date? Yeah. Yeah, I'd like to. Tonight went really well, so I'm really happy. I didn't know my one was bigger... ...until in my early 20s, to be honest, because I'm not really actively looking at hard penises. Until people started actually commenting on it, and women that I know who have slept with a lot of black guys and they're categorically telling me, "You're bigger," that's when I'm thinking, "Hmm..." That's when I realised, "OK, maybe I'm a bit bigger than the average." 27-year-old YouTuber Cam has felt objectified for his size all his adult life, something that has led him to create videos exploring these taboos. The main reason why I actually started my YouTube channel was because I actually wanted to tackle difficult and controversial topics. First topic that I felt I had to address was race-related, and specifically the fetishisation of black men. Is it true that all black men seem to have a bigger penis than other races, for example? Between me and my friends, we've got thousands of examples. It usually kind of shows itself when you're talking to a girl and they will always make it known what their preference is, and they seem to think that's a compliment, but it really isn't. For example, I was talking to a girl. The white girl made it very, very clear. She categorically said, you know, "I don't date white guys, "I only go for black guys." That is obviously an example of fetishisation. OK... That's perfect. What's going on, the people that miss your boy, Cam Topical juice? Ancl I'm back with another video for y'all, talking about the fetishisation of black men. I believe that a lot of this does come from pornography. Fed up with the depiction of black men in porn, Cam decides to make a new video exploring the big black cock fetish. BBC isn't the broadcasting company. It is... It stands for Big Black Cock. Just... I basically just typed in "BBC" and this is just on one random porn site... ...and it's got 85,101 results. So you've got related search, "BBC Rough", "BBC Orgasm", "Black Cock", "BBC gang bang", "BBC threesome, "blacked"... Oh...! How I didn't mention this in my video - blacked. Ancl look, look at the common theme. It's all... It's black men, but look at the women. It's not ebony women, what they call it, that's a porn category, "ebony". It's not black women, it's white women, all being drilled by big black cocks, you know, by BBCs. It really kind of makes you feel like less of a human, type thing, because I feel like a lot of women should be able to empathise with this a lot because women...are sexualised heavily in society. You know, the male gaze, we're just looking...at women as sexual objects. Women don't like that - they...kind of feel used. I feel exactly the same. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get objectified all the time. It's happened to me a few times. Like, I'd fall out with someone and they're... They'd, like, holler back at me and get in touch. Not to know how I'm doing, you know what I mean, but because of what's down there and then it's just like... Oh. The fetishisation of the willies are... In my head, I'm like, "Right, OK, "we can't let the team down...!" Cos it's...! HE LAUGHS Cos, obviously, you know it's not true. Like, they say, "Oh, yeah, black men have bigger willies." They really don't, but in my head, I'm like, since I'm going to represent, let's... Let's... Let's...keep the stereotype going. Matt feels he has been used only for his large penis in previous relationships. There was one girl who was very into me being at my biggest, so she found... Online, she ordered a custom penis pump that I could...use to be basically as hard as long as she wanted it to be. You know, "I wanna see it fully erect," and obviously the only way to do that is with pumping. It's not something you can maintain, an erection. It creates a vacuum seal, and then, even if you're not particularly aroused, you end up filling up the tube. She'd be doing the cooking, I would be encouraged to fill this up and then you can unplug it and then you can go about your daily business. She'd be able to look at me like some sort of phallic totem pole while we were watching TV or playing Scrabble or...doing whatever mundane evening activities she wanted. Ancl when you're in a situation, you obviously are very exposed, and it's perhaps flattering to get that level of attention, but also it's very... You know, it's degrading to be... ...you know, expected to perform like that. She was a size-obsessed woman, obviously... ...and she ended up just sharing my pictures around... ...without my consent and that was obviously pretty hurtful as well. Like, you know, no-one wants to be treated like a piece of meat. To find true love, Matt is considering a drastic solution for his problem and has plucked up the courage to visit a surgeon specialising in penis reduction surgery. He's meeting Dr Djakovic, a specialist in urology. It's exciting, but I don't know what he can do. I always feel a bit, you know, "Am I big enough for a reduction?" Just to know what the options are, realistically, at this point. I mean, if he can just take...an inch off, that might be life-changing. Obviously nervous because you get a bit squeamish, you know, thinking about what could be happening. I just wanna know what it entails. Hi. Hello, hi. Can you explain to me what the reason is for this, well, let's say unusual request? Because most people are looking for penile enlargement and you're looking the opposite. I've had a lot of issues all my life. I think I've never had... 'n. I know I'll never find a partner who is that perfect fit, I think, at my current size, and it would be good just to maybe just have...a slight reduction. What we can offer to you is an reasonable reduction in length and girth, if this is what you're looking for. Yes. Then the surgery will be clone in erection and then we do the amputation of that...amount, what...is your desire. Cos I'm definitely at the point where I don't know how much I would sensibly want to remove. Ancl I'm assuming you couldn't just take a little bit off with a little bit more of surgery, theoretically? Yeah, well... Don't think you'd do that, but... Well, we can't do the salami technique. You can't cut a little bit and each year, to cut a little bit, so once we have clone it, that's it. Yeah. Is it possible? Can I see your penis? Yes. What size do have an erection? About ten...and a half, yeah. What would be the appropriate length of your penis? I don't know. I think of going down to even just, like, nine or... Nine inches? And the reduction in girth is how much? What do you think? Uh... Probably about an inch...or two? An inch? In circumference? Not too... Yeah. This is definitely possible. Yeah. We put it in erection, the corporeal body, you see here, you fill it completely... Yeah. Ancl then the measures are taken. Then this will be amputated... Yeah. Take off this part and then put everything together. OK. Ancl this is now in complete erection. First of all, you should know that they are performed very seldomly because there is no clear statistics regarding success rate... OK. ...nor a clear statistic regarding the complication rate. But we have, per year, two or three of these patients, performing this type of surgery. Thank you. I did not realise the sheer number of complications, the possible difficulties, the lack of an exact removal. Just having spoken to someone who knows the subject so well, gave me that reassurance. It's definitely an extreme solution, but it's certainly something that I could be considering. So sometimes I do wish I was a little bit smaller. I would probably still be in one or two of my relationships from the past if I had a smaller penis, you know. So, yeah, sometimes I do wish I had, I was a smaller size, yeah. It's not difficult to attract love. Might be somewhat difficult... ...keeping it, you know, like, just depending on how that partner, how sex is affected with that partner, for example. If it's something that, you know, if she loves, you know, the situation that's there, then incredible. But if it's a problem, then that's... I don't want to say red flags, she can't take dick. You know what I mean, like, that's not what I'd say, but it's more like a, it's definitely amber. The date with Melina. It went really well. But there just wasn't quite that connection in the end, I think, so we've parted ways. Scott's very large penis has often meant sex has been difficult in his relationships. But at last, things are looking up. I'd a new date since. I just met somebody on a random night out. We went on a date last night and it really well, I think anyway. I'd like to see where things go with that, if I'm honest. But while I was with her, dancing with her... ...one of the guys went up to her and just basically said, "Yeah, Scott's got a big cock". I was quite annoyed about it cos again, I don't want people to know me because of that. I want people to know me for my personality. As well as ruining his date, the videos of Scott's penis continue to do the rounds and it's getting him down. One of the guys created something recently, a new group on WhatsApp. He goes, "Oh, the video came out". Ancl then one of the one of the guys asked, "Which video?" He replied, "Weymouth one, where he comes out of the shower", and one of the guys goes, "Oh, I've got it", and the other guy goes, "Oh, yeah, I've got that in my wank bank". They've taken it without me knowing. Just casually having a shower, come out afterwards, getting changed. And that happens. It's that sort of stuff just gets sent around. That's not what I want to be known for. INTERVIEWER: Why have you put up with it for so long? Why have you not said anything? Maybe I don't say it enough that actually, "Come on, guys, let's put a stop to it for, you know, "don't take it without my consent. You know, enough's enough, really". So I'm going to give my mate a call and have a chat with him. Would it be OK to catch up with you? Bye. So we'll see what happens. YouTuber Cam is exploring the fetishisation of black men for a new video for his channel. I'm expecting big clicks, expecting women to be throwing themselves at these black men on the stage. Let's see what happens. Tonight, he's visiting an all-male black strip show to find out what's so fascinating to the women in the audience. It's the whole shit. Let's go. Two, one... SCREAMING To keep the audience satisfied and to live up to the stereotype of the black man, the performers go to great LENGTHS. It's just like an air vacuum. Because there's nothing here to arouse us, like women or whatever, we have to stimulate that effect somehow. So we use these pumps to get all the blood in the penis. Ancl then tie off the base so the blood stays in. Because if your performance is 20 minutes, 25 minutes, nobody's really looking to see a soft penis. Having felt fetishised himself in the past, Cam wants to know what the appeal is. This idea of BBC, the fetishisation of things. What's your opinion on that? Black men have been big clicks, for example. Is that true? I must say they're not all the same size. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. They're not all massive. I think it is very much a stereotype. Yeah. Yeah. But me, personally, I've been with some guys that have they got smaller penises. Ancl they're black as well, yeah? What's the pros and cons of a big penis? I mean, pros is to say that, yeah, you took a big, big penis. Oh, OK, OK, OK. OK. You can handle that. To be fair, because the reason I ask is because what's your opinion on, say, for example, white women are only go for black men, for instance? I feel like if you're, the only reason you'll go for black men is because you think they got a big click and you need to educate yourself. OK. Being a white woman, for example, what is it about black men that you are attracted to? I mean, you saw what was on the stage, right? If I had to choose between a lot, like a medium to larger size, and there's more, then I probably would go for a medium to large size. If, for example, a black guy doesn't have a big penis, for example, do you think it's a bit of fun to him, for example, that there's this narrative that all black men must have big clicks, but actually there's a lot of men out there that don't have big clicks? As a woman, you have to take responsibility to, to support your man and say, you know, "I like you the way you are". But if you don't like the guy the way he is, then you have to move on. One of the major things I've learned is that people who have a preference, for example, especially if they kind of fetishise a certain race, they'll always do mental hula hoops to kind of rationalise it and justify it in their mind. A lot of these women, I think secretly they do like the idea of this BBC type thing, but not all of them do. When the white woman I actually interviewed, she made a point about actually it's just about making men feel comfortable no matter what the size. This belief is much more common amongst younger Brits. I think it's a really good way to judge the honesty of a man to actually say, "What is your size? "Now prove it". So that one's for girth. It's an old-fashioned idea that the bigger the cock, the bigger the man. Ancl it seems to be that a big cock equals a like a really, really manly person. No such thing as an alpha male. It's a complete fad. There's a lot of positives to having a big penis. But I don't, I don't think having a big penis should make anyone feel, we shouldn't be any less of a man, if I had a smaller penis. Scott's had enough of the banter and relentless sharing of pictures amongst his team-mates. He's meeting his mate, Alec, in the hope that something will change. It's to do with obviously my penis and a bit of banter about it with you and the guys, and you're one of the sort of main forefront of it and I feel at times I feel a bit objectifying. It sort of hampered my dating scene locally because everyone knows about it. I think it's more a celebration, though. I think if you're honest, Scott, I think you like a little bit of the notoriety of it. I can understand it could hamper you, but I think it could also really benefit you as well. How would you feel if that was your click being shown around? I think I'd love it. You'd love it? Yeah. It's when pictures are taken and videos are taken that aren't consented, that get sent to the mates, work colleagues and people just know Scott Newman for that. Put all around Dorset and Somerset. Listen, I know, but the guys, it is in good humour. Just imagine if it was like, say, your wife's tits being sent around. No-one would have access to, to that. No, but then why should they have access to me? You're in a changing room. If were honest, around the guys, you're not shy. Not that you have to be. When I'm in that situation, I try and say, "Look, that's enough", they keep going with it or just keeps carrying on. But I think I'm at that point now where I'm like... I still see it as a positive, but I do understand that... Yeah, no, I appreciate that. ...you're subject to a lot of conversation. Yeah, I am. Ancl I don't want... The only thing worse than being spoken about is not being spoken about. You know that, Scott. But I will have a word with the guys, if it would make life in the changing room a little bit easier on match clay. I would definitely appreciate that. Yeah? I think it is all clone in good humour. But I can imagine, you know, when the match has stopped, the changing rooms are filled and he goes home, that perhaps it does maybe weigh on him a little bit. I don't think the guys know, I certainly didn't know. And, you know, I'm glad he brought it to our attention. And, you know, I probably will perhaps act a little bit differently. I do feel a lot more confident that he'll put it towards the lads and subtly and sort of say, yeah, you know, "This is how Scott feels", and so I'm hoping that will happen. Maybe just give me a bit more respect and just, you know, just let me know if you want to take a picture or, you know, just don't do it without me not knowing, you know? Oh, my God. Names for penises that people have told me. Little johnny. You know, Whopper. That's it, Destroyer. Purple-headed Destroyer. Dick, cock. Uh... I used to call him jimmy. I don't know why. I think just Old Willy or in Scotland they say Bobby, I think that's just a bit boring, wasn't it? So I just gave him, like, a different name, Jimmy, just to, I don't know why it was a boring name anyway, so. The timing's have worked out that I've got to phone the doctor now to let him know my decision. It's been 20 days since his visit to the surgeon to discuss a penis reduction, and Matt has been carefully considering his options. Hello, this is Matt calling about the recent reduction appointment. Yeah, Matt... Yes, I just wanted to say thank you for your time. It was really enlightening, but I think you made it very clear all of the risks. Ancl until I'm 100% sure, I don't think I can really go along with it. It's a very severe procedure. Yeah. Ancl I think this is a good idea just if you're not sure. Cheers. Thank you, bye. Bye. I think what you want is to be a good side of average. But you should be proud of yourself for who you are, what your personality is, what your accomplishments are, not for what's between your legs. You don't wanna give up too much, still a romantic at heart. So you want to think there's someone out there for me, whether that is reduced me or not. Hopefully I can find enough peace in myself with whatever conclusion I come to that I will find that person. That's why it's really important to the carrier of a big penis to understand that, you know your value of self should not be attributed to your penis. Like there's a lot more to you than your penis. So that's not something that you want to go bigging up in a conversation. There's a thousand things to bring up before bringing up the size of your penis. Subtitles by Red Bee Media
