Blood level opiates has dropped drastically. Consciousness is imminent. (heart monitor beeping) (man quivering) (man heavily breathing) (eerie music) - [Male Patient] Pain. I must be alive. I feel pain. I remember... Pain. (explosion rumbling) (man yelling) How long has it been? Who am I? (dramatic beat music) What am I? What have they done? What? (eerie music) I remember the... I remember the... The flames burning. (man screaming) Why? How did I get there? I don't know. - [Male Announcer] Subject is now conscious for first time in 267 days. Vital signs remain strong. - Amazing.

What has he done to me? Who am I? Who am I? Where am I? (man screaming) (suspenseful music) They show me movies where people do things to each other. (faint fighting grunts) Kill each other. (faint punches thudding) They interest me. They shouldn't. But they do. (punches thudding) (suspenseful music) They make me remember things. (eerie music) Why? (punches thudding) (men grunting) Why the movies? Why violence? (gunshots banging) (man yelping) (metal clanking) - 13 skin graft operations. It's gotta be some sort of record. - Well, I think it's time we met our favorite patient. (ominous music) Excellent work. - [Gray Man] Thank you. - Damn waist of money. - Easy, or our boy might hear us. - Nah. Won't be up for another two hours, at least. (patient growling) (suspenseful music) - Where am I? (patient growling) (patient yelping) Don't! - Arm him down! Keep him wrapped until he's out of our hands! - Let go! Let go! (patient grunting) (music distorting) (explosion rumbling) (fire crackling) (eerie music) (man screaming) - [Male Patient] What kind of man am I? (metal clanking) - Could you undo one arm? So I could eat, please. - You okay now, man? (metal screeching) I'd hate to have spoonfeed you, you know? - Just one arm, please. - All right, you promise to be good, I'll undo the straps. Cool? - Yeah, cool. - All right. After all, it's your first solid food, right? Might as well enjoy yourself. - Thanks. (cranking squeaking) You know, the other doctors, they won't talk to me. Will you? - [Orderly] Sure, I'll talk to you. - [Patient] Where are we? - I can't say. Got the same order as the docs. Here you go. - Hospital. It's a hospital, isn't it? - Sorry, pal. You wanna talk about baseball or something? - The movies, they show me movies. - Huh? - Why are they showing me those movies? - Beats me. So kind of test. You wanna change the subject? I just get paid to deliver the food. - Well, maybe you can get somebody to tell me what's going on. Would you do that? - [Orderly] Sorry, pal. (ominous music) (fork clinking) - I dropped the fork. - I'll get it for you. - Thanks. - There you go. Okay. - You know, I don't feel hungry anymore. Maybe you could take the tray away. - All right, sure thing. (ominous music) (man gasping) - You move and I'll slit your throat! You're gonna tell me, where are we? - I can't! (orderly gagging) - Where are we? We're gonna find, we're gonna go out of here to find someone who can tell us! Huh? - Guards, guards everywhere. They'll kill us. They'll kill both of us. - Where are we? Where? - In prison. Sort of. I can't say more. They'll hurt me. - Like this? - Oh God, don't let him kill me! Oh God! (orderly crying) - You know who I am. You know where I come from, what I am. Tell me what you want! Tell me! (door clanking) (footsteps tapping) (ominous music) Okay! I want answers. - It's good to see you up and around. Not to worry, I'm not expecting anybody. - You run this place? - No, nobody runs this place. But I can give you answers. - Yeah? Who am I? - You? You're nobody. You're a dead man. You're what I make of you. (knife clinking) Ate some of the food, didn't you? Two mouthfuls, to be exact. You felt a surge of energy. Made you feel alive inside. Strong. Strong enough to cut that nurse. (patient gasping) (patient groaning) How do you feel now? - Huh? - You want answers? Your name's Garrett. Harlin Garrett. You're a murder. As assassin for hire. An expert in death. (Garrett moaning) Quite simply, a killing machine. Oh yeah. You have temporal amnesia. It's a result of a trauma. Not to worry, it'll pass. And I'm told if you work real hard, you should be able to remember something of what you've done. (foreboding music) (Garrett groaning) (Garrett heavily breathing) (man laughing) (suspenseful music) (gun clinking) (gunshot booming) Those are stories about a recent incident in which one of this country's most shadowy figures met his demise. That's you, Garrett. A hit man for the underworld. You killed their enemies, cleanly and quietly. You worked for scum. You killed scum. That is until you met your match with an incident with the police who were at scene, courtesy of your ex-employers. You were double-crossed. (gunshots booming) (suspenseful music) - Says this guy died in a fire. - That's right, you did. Nobody could've survived that fire. (dramatic music) (fire crackling) (heels tapping) - Who are you? - I'm a nurse. - Why are you here? - To have sex... With you. (pleasant tempo music) It's been a long time, hasn't it? Yes, touch me. (dramatic tempo music) - How much are they paying you? - Does it matter? - I just wanna make sure they're getting their money's worth. - They will. (nurse moaning) (dramatic tempo music) - They're watching, aren't they? - I like being watched. - [Doctor] Blood pressure rising. Pulse now 84 and climbing. (nurse moaning) - I think he's regained his sexual functions. - Thank you for that information, doctor. (nurse moaning) - Well, to all intents and purposes, I think he's normal. (nurse moaning) - He is anything but normal. (dramatic tempo music) (nurse moaning) - Where are we? - What? - Tell me where we are. - I can't. I can't. - Please. Please, please. (nurse moaning) Please. Please. Please. (nurse moaning) - Wash... Ing... Ton. (dramatic tempo music) - Where am I? - Sit down. You have nowhere to go, now, sit down. Now, you listen to me. This is a government facility, which I am the director. You were pronounced dead on arrival after the fire and brought here, to me. - Where's here? - We saved your life, Garrett. Even if you had left, you'd ended up on death row somewhere. That is, if the mob hadn't got to you first. - [Garrett] What do you want? - We'd like to run you through some tests, a screening process, and if the results are satisfactory, we'd like you to work for us. - [Garrett] Who's us? - The CIA. Well, actually, that's not true. We're the FBI. Well, I'm lying. We're the PTA, we're the Ace Trucking Company. Let's just say, we're the people who run this country. - What do you want from me? - Good. Now, how many people have you killed? - Nobody. I haven't killed anybody. (man sighing) - Turner. (door clanking) (footsteps stomping) (ominous music) Get rid of this garbage. - Come on, garbage. (suspenseful music) (punches thudding) (men screaming) (punches thudding) (gun clicking) The same old Garrett, well I'm impressed. (punch clonking) (Garrett gasping) (punches thudding) (Garrett groaning) (door clanking) - Thank you, Turner, I'll take it from here. (door thudding) Now. Piero Bassetti. Drug dealer, November 3rd, 1982. New York. Ricky Santana. Drug dealer, August 17th, 1983. (gunshot booming) Miami. (eerie music) Woody Schmidt. Arms dealer. February the first, 1984, Frankfurt. (gunshot booming) Den Ming, arms dealer. November the 17th. - 1985. (gunshot booming) (ominous music) New York. - Very good. We've been following your career for some time now with considerable interest. Now think. (lighter clicking) Think very hard. How many people have you killed? (gunshots booming) - 15. (gunshot booming) I killed 15 people. (sinister music) Who the fuck are you? - This piece of human garbage tried to hold up a drugstore last night. He shot the owner and his wife eight times in the face each, after they'd given him what he asked for. $73 and 95 cents. We got a tip today and we picked him up before the police could get their hands on him. Nobody knows he's here, nobody's going to miss him. - I am owed my fucking rights. I want my fucking layer, you fucking pricks! - Take a look at this man, Garrett. Do you wanna see him go free? - I want him fucking right now! - What do you think made him behave the way he did? - I don't know, why don't you ask him? - What a good idea. Excuse me, sir. Why did you shoot those people in the face last night? (man laughing) - Fuck you! - Oh yeah? (sinister music) Shut up! This man does not belong on the planet, Garrett. You do because you serve a purpose. I'm afraid he's just incorrigible. (ominous music) I want you to kill him. - Look, you want him dead, you kill him. I wouldn't waste my breath on him. - This is fucking bullshit. Who the fuck are you anyway? Fuck you, I'll kill you! - You'll kill me, you little punk? - Here. (suspenseful music) (man groaning) (kicks thudding) (man groaning) - [Garrett] I won't do this! I won't! (punch thudding) (Garrett groaning) - You ain't man enough to fucking kill me. (kick thudding) It's just you and me, cock sucker! (kick thudding) I don't know what kind of fucking game this is but I'm starting to like it! (kick thudding) (man groaning) (suspenseful music) (kicks thudding) (man groaning) (man gagging) (Garrett grunting) (neck cracking) (Garrett gasping) - Congratulations, Garrett. It's graduation day. Time to leave. - For where? - New York. - I'll be recognized. - That's highly unlikely with that face. We also took the added precaution of changing your fingerprints during surgery. - Who will I be? - Danny Grange. A drifter from the Midwest. You'll have a driver's license, social security card. - When do I leave? - Tomorrow. There are people in possession of information threatening to the wellbeing of this nation. They must be eliminated. You're going to do something for us. Do it and we'll let you live. - I could run. - You could try but you wouldn't get very far. At the moment, you're dead, not forgotten. You cross me and I'll let all the right people know that Harlan Garrett, the cop killer, the man with a mob contract over his head, is alive and well and walking the streets. You see, we gave you the gift of life. You fuck with me and I'll turn that gift into a living nightmare from which you can not survive. (sinister music) Get some rest. It's a jungle out there. (door thudding) (dramatic beat music) - [Garrett] What kind of man am I? What kind of man chooses death as a profession? If there's a God, I deserve to die. They must realize by now I'm not the man I was. I can't do what I once did. Perhaps they'll kill me. She said to do it. The one with the gun in her purse. Is she the one? Are they gonna kill me now? On the street in bright daylight? Are they that bold? That above the law? (dramatic beat music) (wind howling) I've done such vile things. Such wrong. How did I justify the violence? Are the people I killed any worse than me? Did they deserve to die? Some had families, children. I know this. I investigated each victim before I killed them. (foreboding music) (Garrett huffing) Who can forgive me for what I have done? And why should they? Now what have I done? Traded my life for more death? (Garrett huffing) Surely I'm beyond redemption. (suspenseful tempo music) (fire rumbling) (Garrett screaming) (exciting rock music) ♪ My momma told me to tell daddy, showed me the chain ♪ ♪ My daddy angel taught me how to swing ♪ ♪ When my daddy left me, momma was there ♪ ♪ We ran to a small village called regret ♪ (exciting rock music) - What would you like? (woman moaning) - [Garrett] She doesn't recognize me. - You want a drink or what? - A beer, please. - [Garrett] But then again, after what I've done, who would want to remember me? (ominous music) - [Green] How many people have you killed? ♪ To keep you away ♪ I guess it's a little too, look how it moves ♪ ♪ Guess I forgot I can be what I choose ♪ ♪ Everyone is high (faint rock music) (man groaning) - Who are you, the fucking man from plant, huh? - What the fuck? - Who sent you? - Nobody! - Who sent you? - Nobody! - Who do you work for? - The post office! - The fucking post office? (suspenseful music) (man yelling) - Help! (kick thudding) - [Garrett] Why you following me, huh? - I'm not! - I know you're watching me! - I'm not! Please! Hey, come on! Help! Help! Help! Help! - You wanna fuck with me, huh? - Somebody help me, please! - What the fuck? (punches thudding) (suspenseful music) (man groaning) (ominous music) - [Waitress] Garrett? (somber piano music) You're supposed to be dead. - [Garrett] I am. - [Waitress] What happened to your face? - I bought a new one. On borrowed time. - What do you want from me, Garrett? - I just need to talk. - Do me a favor, Garrett. Stay away, please. I'm trying to get a life together here. I don't need any trouble. (somber saxophone music) - You won't see me again. (man laughing) (punch thudding) (man groaning) (man laughing) (punch thudding) - Woo! (punches thudding) (man laughing) Woo! (ominous music) (man groaning) Come on. What the fuck are you looking at? - Leave him alone. - You got a badge to go with that big mouth, fuck head? - Please. - Huh, is this what you're looking for? Aye? Come get it. Come on! - Yeah, come on, motherfucker, come on! - Come on. - Let's see what you got. (ominous music) (thug grunting) (suspenseful music) (Garrett groaning) (punches thudding) (kicks thudding) - Come on! Come on! (thug grunting) - I'm gonna cut your nuts off, motherfucker! (arm cracking) (bald thug groaning) (suspenseful music) (bald thug yelling) - I understand you. (kick thudding) (bald thug yelping) (foreboding music) (whooshes echoing) (door creaking) What are you doing here? - It's time for your first assignment. - What do you want from me? - We want you to terminate certain individuals for us and for your country. - I'm not killing anyone. - You were made to kill. It's what you do well and what you'll continue to do well under my direction. - There's a hundred other guys. Why me? - These assignments are special. They need that special touch. Something we can't buy. They can't look like assassinations. They have to look like random killings. You, my friend, you can give it that personal touch. - I told you, I'm not doing that anymore. - You have no choice. Now, just do what you're told and cut the bullshit. - Who? - Let's start with that little bitch you chose to expose yourself to. - You listen to me. Leave her out of this. She's harmless. - Nobody's harmless. Not you, not me, not her. Besides, you only have yourself to blame. You chose to bring her into this. (door creaking) I want her dead within 24 hours. (door thudding) (glass shattering) - Morning, Mike. - Hey Jane, how you doing? - Just shut up and listen to me. I want you to leave town now. - What? What did I do? - Just do it, okay? - Let me go, Garrett! - Did you hear me? - What are you talking about? I ain't gonna cause you any trouble. Okay, I never saw you, all right? - I want you to leave town and never come back here. I swear, I swear I'll kill you. - Sure, whatever you say. I'm out of here, I'll just go get my stuff. - No, forget about your stuff, forget about your job, forget everything. I just want you to get the outta here! - Okay. I'm gone, all right, I'm gone! Just let me fucking go, I'm gone! I thought you were different. You're not. - Listen to me. Just disappear, okay? Please. - Should've stayed away. I hate you! (somber tempo music) - There are people in possession of information threatening to the wellbeing of this nation. They must be eliminated. You're going to do something for us. Do it and we'll let you live. (somber beat music) How'd it go? - It's done. - Where's the body? - Gone. It's taken care of. - New business. His name's Baker. He's a political activist, we want him out of the way. (somber piano music) (foreboding music) (sinister music) (Garrett groaning) - These corporate homophobics have got to understand, we aren't a bunch of trembling weaklings hiding in dark closets. Discrimination in the workplace has got to stop and it's got to stop now. - Mr. Baker, don't you think that minimum quotas for hiring gays is a little radical? - It was radical for blacks once. It was radical for women once. Radical thoughts and actions have a way of becoming the norm. We aren't going to stop until we are considered normal. - Thank you, Mr. Baker. - Is that it? - That's it, we'll let you know when the piece runs. (somber tempo music) (engine rumbling) (men laughing) - So remember, the next time we meet with the mayor, we'll have a special little surprise for him, all right? - The 13th. - That's it, the 13th, yes? And don't you forget to tell Phillip, so that he can get in on the fun too, all right? Good night, now. Good night, take care. - [Man] Good night. (pleasant classical piano music) - Quit a view, isn't it? (pleasant classical piano music) The view's even better in there. (ominous music) (heartbeat thumping) (shades clattering) - [News Anchor] The gay rights movement suffered a severe blow last night with the murder of activist Tony Baker in what police describe as a bloody sadomasochistic scene that went too far. The movement not only loses its most vocal leader but what many see as its credibility as well. Baker's attempts to have the gay community seen as normal have been nullified, to say the least. Police indicate that their primary suspect is an employee of Baker's. (phone ringing) In other-- - [Garrett] Yes? - Good, you're safe. - [Garrett] I don't like this. - You'll develop a taste for it sooner or later. - I kill drug dealers, murderers. Baker was an innocent. - Myself, I don't care one way or the other. I only do what my country asks of me. - I'm a wanted man in this country. - Garrett, I assure you, the good people of West Virginia don't care about Baker's death. I hear the weather in Chicago is wonderful this time of year. Unfortunately, they've had a rash of break-ins. One of which is about to turn very tragic. - Who is he? - His name's Conners. He's an investigative reporter with a nose for some very damaging information. That nose is about to get cut off. It's a shame when a man isn't safe in his own house, don't you think? You call me from Chicago. Have a nice day. - I have other plans. - Garrett? (ominous tempo music) (traffic whooshing) (foreboding music) - Kendall, you're amazing. I can't believe this stuff. - So David, can you use it? - Are you kidding me? This story could be huge. Does anybody else know about this? - I talked to Baker in New York. - Baker was just killed. - Yeah, I know. No, you don't think. - No. No, he had some bizarre tastes, that's all. I wouldn't worry about it. Just the same, you gotta be careful. When do you leave Chicago? - Conference is over tomorrow, I fly out tomorrow night. I've gotta go, nobody knows I'm here. Oh, it's cold. - Thank you. Just remember what I said. - I will. Good night. - Good night. (foreboding music) (car door thudding) (engine rumbling) (sinister tempo music) (door clicking) (watch beeping) (sinister tempo music) (music box chiming) (clock ticking) (eerie music) (floor creaking) (electronic beeping) (wind howling) (heartbeat thumping) - Hey, Stephanie! (Stephanie screaming) (suspenseful music) - David! (bat swishing) (David groaning) (Stephanie screaming) David! (David grunting) David! (gunshot booming) (Stephanie screaming) (ominous beat music) David! (Stephanie screaming) David! David! - What's wrong with my mommy? - [Stephanie] David! (Stephanie screaming) David! - Well, there's been an accident. - [Stephanie] No! (Stephanie screaming) - But the police will be here soon. - [Stephanie] No! - You wait right here, all right? Everything's gonna be okay. - Are you coming back? - Some other time, perhaps. - [Stephanie] David! (Stephanie screaming) (Stephanie crying) (door thudding) - He's dead. Does it matter how? He's dead. - [Green] And you'll be dead if you screw up again, do you understand? - Yes. I understand. - [Green] Do you? - Yes. - [Green] Your next assignment is delicate. A professor. White, female. Make her your friend, we need to learn what she knows. - Where is she located? - [Green] On a campus in Massachusetts. She's highly regarded there, but she's never had much luck with men. Too busy causing trouble. Be nice to her, understand? - Yes. I will be her friend. - [Green] You'll keep working for us until I tell you to stop. Our country is being threatened, Garrett, constantly. We do what's necessary. (dramatic beat music) You're doing the right thing. You're serving your country. Protecting the innocent. (dramatic beat music) (computer keys clicking) (computer beeping) - Okay if I call it a night? - Um... Yeah. Just, go ahead. Thank you for your help tonight. - Do you need a lift? - No thanks, I'll call a cab later. - [Assistant] Okay, goodbye. (dramatic beat music) (faint pop music) (cash register beeping) - Oh! Oh, oh, oh gosh, I'm so sorry. - It's okay, no harm done. - Oh, I'm such a klutz. (Ann chuckling) - Let me give you a hand with that. - [Ann] Appreciate that. - You're welcome. - How clumsy I am. I'll get that out of the way. - You look like you're in a hurry. - Yes. I left work late and I completely lost track of time. - You must have an interesting job. - Yeah, I do. Yeah, I do. - Well, good night. - Good night. Thank you. (faint pop music) (ominous music) (cash register beeping) (traffic whooshing) Steve Rogers, our security guy. Uh-huh. Yes, he is, he's a very nice guy. No, no, no, no, no. (fax machine buzzing) He's just a friend. No, he's helping me out. He's putting in an alarm system, so I thought I would reciprocate by making him dinner. (ominous music) You know, I don't know. I don't know, it's not coming up. I'll check on it, I'll bring it in the morning. (fax machine buzzing) That's very funny. All right. All right, good night. (Ann groaning) Oh! Sugar. (ominous music) (engine rumbling) - What you need is sensors on each window. (faint pleasant music) I can get you a deal on a whole new system. A thousand bucks, tops. - [Ann] Yeah? - Yeah. Cost you twice as much, otherwise. Big house like this. - [Ann] Well, that sounds reasonable. (faint pleasant music) - Great dinner, Annie. - Oh, thanks, I'm so sorry about the lasagna. - Hey, I've been trying to get over here for six months. I'd have eaten that lasagna right off the floor. - Yeah, I have been busy, haven't I? - You look tired, Annie. You know, working around a homosexual disease all day, can't be good for you. - Well, Steve, it's not just homosexuals. AIDS can effect anyone. - All right, you need to relax. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, no, no, I don't dance. - Oh, I don't dance, I don't drink. I just work, work, work, work, work. - No, I do other things. - Oh really? - Yes, I do. - Why don't you show me then? - Steve. - You have a really unhealthy attitude about life, Annie. Now careful or you're gonna wind up a dried up old prune. - No. Steve, no. - Hey. Annie. Steve Rogers, head of security. You're safe with me, babe. - No! (ominous music) - Okay. I'm sorry. (ominous music) - No, no, no, no! No! - Relax, come on! - No! (intense music) - Who the fuck are you? - Out. - Who is this guy, Annie? - [Garrett] Out! - Okay. Hey, hey! Annie, all right! (intense beat music) (faint pleasant music) - You dropped this at the store. I was just bringing it back to you and... Well, I'm sorry, I heard you... Well, it looked like you needed some help. ♪ We'll discover how special - Thank you. (Ann gasping) Oh, I'm so embarrassed. He was, he's a friend. He was helping me put in some alarm system and... Oh. (Ann chuckling) - I hope he doesn't bother you again. (Ann sighing) - Yeah, me too. (Ann stammering) I don't know what to say. - Don't worry about it. You all right? (Ann sighing) - I think so. Yeah, thank you. - Good night. - Good night. Wait, wait! I don't even know your name. - Grange. Danny Grange. - Ann. Ann Kendall. - I know. The wallet. - Oh yeah, of course. I feel so silly. - You sure you're all right? - Yeah. Yes, I am, thank you, thank you very much. - Good night. - Good night. - Make sure you lock the your door behind me. - That's a good idea. I will, thank you. (pleasant saxophone music) - You're right. The conclusion is inescapable. - [Ann] It is, isn't it? - [Man] You're sure on these findings? - The point of origin was decidedly manufactured. We know where it came from. The proof is all in my data. - Is there another copy of this data? - I didn't want to take any chances, so I stored it all on my own discs. - Good. Keep it that way. - So, do we go public? - Not yet. - Tom, why not? You said it yourself, everything's here. You know, the consequences of this could lead to a cure. You know, maybe even a vaccine. - We start making accusations like this and we could start making enemies. As president of this institution, I am concerned about the impact. (foreboding music) - I don't believe this place. - Annie? (dramatic beat music) - [Ann] 123 Pine Street, please. (engine rumbling) - Hi, how are you? - Hi. Um... I'm much better than last night, thanks to you. - How do you know this guy? - He runs security for the university. - [Garrett] Security? - Mm-hmm. - He's not doing a very good job. - [Ann] You could be right about that. - You a student? - No, I'm a professor. - You don't look like a professor. - Oh yeah? What do professors look like? - Well, you know, older, stuffier. Less attractive. - That's very flattering. - Flattery brings better tips. - I'm sure. (dramatic beat music) - Thanks. Can I see you again? - Yeah, I'd like that. (engine rumbling) (sinister music) - Hi, I'm here to see Dr. Kendall. - Danny, hi there. - Hey. - I'll be right down. - You got it. Hey. - [Ann] How you doing? - All right. Nice coat. (Ann giggling) Why don't you come inside, I'll get you one. - Yeah, that sounds good to me. (door buzzing) - Ah! Hold on a sec. (ominous tempo music) (door buzzing) There we go. (Ann mumbling) When I first started working on the virus, it was a test, it was a real challenge. It was abstract. When I started working on the victims and everything just changed. The men are so, so sick. And there's women and the kids. It's just a horrible, horrible way to die. It's unfair. - You had any luck? (Ann sighing) - Yes. And no. Want a bite? - Yeah, I need some information on one of your drivers. Haven't got a name. 5' 10". Dark. And muscle-bound. What is it? Danny Grunge. Grange. Sounds like him. Background usual stuff. No, just a routine check. He's got a chat with the VIP of the school. We just wanna protect her. Uh-huh. Yeah, listen, can you fax over his application? Is there a picture with that? Excellent. - So, what kinds of courses are you thinking of taking? - American literature. - American literature, that's interesting. - Yeah. - That's cool. So what did you do before this? - Mind if I smoke? - No, I don't mind. Thanks for asking. - I lived here and there, you know, temporarily. (faint mellow music) - Here and there, yeah? Here, there, were? - Last stop was Alaska. - [Anna] Alaska? Really? What were you doing in Alaska? - Pipeline. I like the outdoors. Gives me time to think, read, do a little writing. - You write? You write, well what do you write about? - Pain, guilt. Life, death. Man, God, law, you know, the usual bullshit. I really liked your house. - [Ann] Thanks. - I envy you. - Really? You know, growing up around school has its limits. I envy you, your freedom. (Garrett groaning) No really, I do. You're... You're some... Knight... Who's come in from some strange and distant place. - White or black? - I'm not sure. (faint mellow music) But I think I'd like to find out. (distant dog barking) (clock ticking) (ominous music) (Ann gasping) - Sorry. What's wrong? (Ann sniffling) - A friend of mine was killed. - [Garrett] I'm sorry. - He was murdered. (dramatic music) I think it's because of me. - Why? - I told him about my work and now he's dead. - People get killed for a lot of reasons. - No, that's not the first time. I don't think it's a coincidence. - What'd you tell him? - I told him about my research, you don't wanna know. I've told two people and now they're dead, for God sake. - Everything will work out. - Just hold me. Just hold me. Just hold me. (dramatic music) (Ann moaning) Make love to me, Danny. - I can't. I want to but I can't. - Why? - I just... I... (dramatic saxophone music) (Ann huffing) (Ann moaning) (kisses smacking) (Ann sighing) - [Ann] Oh, I feel safe with you. That's important to me. I'm frightened. - [Garrett] What did you find out? - [Ann] No, I don't want anything to happen to you. - [Garrett] Nothing will. I promise you. Now what is it? (Ann sighing) - [Ann] I've discovered the point of origin for the AIDS virus. It came from a government laboratory. Our government. (sinister music) (lighter clicking) - What do you want? - Things have changed. Your courtship's over. We've moved the delivery date up. - What's the hurry? - [Green] We think she's gonna make a move. - Go public? - Good boy, you've been doing your homework. What else do you know? - Everything. - [Green] Her data? - In the lab. - Huh. Wrap it up in 24 hours. I need more time. - You can't have it. Garrett, I want the data. - This is the last one. - Absolutely. You do this for me, I'll give you money, a job, new identity. An instant life. (door thudding) Or an instant death. The choice is yours. (ominous music) (suspenseful tempo music) - You get that photo I sent you? Yeah, you ever seen this guy before? You never employed this man. Not even under an alias. I see. Sorry to bother you. Let's see who you really are. Dolores. Steve. Give me the FBI. - I don't understand. I've known you all of my life and you're not like this. You're waffling. Just tell me why. Why, why, why are we waiting? - This is very dangerous, Annie. - All right, look Tom, you know, if they do have something to hide, if they've engineered this, then maybe somehow they can help us find a cure. You know, they're bound to have information and data that we don't have. Maybe this is just what we need to push them over the edge and to make them come clean. - Yes, I know, I know, that's what we all want but... - What? But what? - There may be serious consequences. (Ann sighing) (gun clicking) (foreboding music) - Annie! Annie! Annie, I gotta talk to you! - I have nothing to say to you. - This guy is not who he says he is. - Stay out of it. - It's my job. It's got nothing to do with what happened. - Back off! (foreboding music) (clock ticking) (suspenseful tempo music) (ominous music) - This is the photo that came with his application for the cab license. All right? And this is what Washington sent out. Number one suspect in a fag murder in New York. - Shit. This is the same guy, all right. - Mm-hmm. - This is a good job, Steve. I mean, why did you even think of checking this guy out? - Something about him I just didn't like. - Well I gotta pick him up. I'll go down to the cab company. - I'll check out the campus. - All right, but you call me in an hour. - You got it, sure. - Listen, Steve. - Huh? - Don't go crazy on me, all right, buddy? - Hey, I don't, I'll wait for you. - All right, man. - Thanks for coming down, sarge. - Okay. (suspenseful beat music) - Excuse me. - Dr. Kendall asked me to pick up some papers for her. Should just be a sec. - I should check with her. - Well, she was asleep when I left her. - Go ahead. - Thanks. (door buzzing) Thanks again. - Hey, no problems. (dial beeping) Mr. Rogers? He's here. (dramatic tempo music) (door buzzing) (metal creaking) (ominous music) (engine revving) (tires screeching) - My name's not Danny Grange. It's Garrett. And I wasn't here to study literature. I came to do a job. - You had to steal from me, huh? - No. To kill you. (Ann gasping) - You're gonna kill me? - No but I have orders to. - From who? - Some branch in the government. I don't know who or what. - What, they hired you? - I traded them my services for my life. - No, you mean my life for your life! - Yes! Yes! - You let go of me! - Listen to me, listen to me! Shut up! - So what're you gonna do? You gonna kill me now, huh? Huh? - He's not gonna kill anyone. Hands in the air, asshole. - This is out of your league. - I said, get your fucking hands in the air. Now! Tough fucking guy, huh? Real tough. - I don't want to hurt you. - Hurt me? How? Oh, like the way you killed that fag in New York? (Ann gasping) - You don't know what you're dealing with here. - Oh, what do I look like, the fucking security guard? You're the one that's in over his head, now start talking! Who hired you? - The Ace Cab Company. - You punk, I ought to kick your. Annie, call the police. - I thought you were the po-- - Shut up! Annie, make the call. - Annie, the police can't protect you. - For Christ sakes, Annie, do as I say! - I came for the data, for your own good. For our own good. - Goddam it, Annie, this guy's a killer. (ominous music) Jesus Christ, I'll do it myself, stupid bitch. (Steve groaning) (suspenseful music) - We have to leave now, trust me. - [Ann] No! (kicks thudding) (sinister music) - Drop the gun. - You win, tough guy. (gunshot booming) (Steve gasping) (ominous music) (Ann crying) - Get over here, he's gone. He's gone. - You killed him? - [Garrett] It was either me or him. - Get away from me! Oh, God. - Annie, I need the data. - Data? There's this dead body laying here, you talk to me about data? - There'll be a few more bodies unless we hurry. If it's not me, it'll be somebody else coming for you. (Ann gasping) Annie, it's the fucking government! Our only chance is to get the data out of here. Then we can bargain. - We, we, we, we? You came here to kill me. - No, I came here to save you. - No, I'm not going anywhere with you. - Annie! Annie, you don't have a choice. - Oh, I don't have a choice? - No. - You just got to hell! (ominous tempo music) (door creaking) (gun clicking) (gun cranking) (bell ringing) (door buzzing) - You got a light? (intense music) (gunshots booming) (man groaning) (suspenseful beat music) - Oh God. Annie! What the hell is happening here? - We waited too long, Tom. - What are you doing? - I'm getting the data out of here, it's not safe. - Were are you going to go? - I don't know, I'm taking these. - Look, look, let me handle this. I can protect you, I'm the only who can. Annie, leave the discs with me! - No! - Annie! - I told you, that's enough! - Annie! Annie, wait! - Dr. Kendall. - Who are you? How did you get in here? - I'm an admirer. I've followed you work for some time now with a great deal of interest. Haven't I, Hanson? You're going somewhere? - Yes, I am. - Ah, ah, ah. No need to run off. - I can handle this. - If you could've, you would've. Class dismissed. (gunshot booming) - Oh! God! (Ann groaning) (suspenseful beat music) (gunshot booming) (Ann groaning) (gunshots popping) (elevator bell ringing) (gunshots booming) (Ann whimpering) - Annie. (Ann moaning) Can you stand? Can you stand? Okay, Annie. - [Ann] Did we escape? - No quit. (suspenseful music) (ominous music) (door thudding) - Freeze, police! Did you see a woman and a man come in through here? - Yes, sir, back there. A guy carrying a woman. Oh, she's hurt bad. He's got a gun. - Thank you. - Okay. (gunshot booming) (foreboding music) (door creaking) (ominous music) (gunshot booming) (ominous beat music) (Ann groaning) - Let's go, we gotta get away. (Ann mumbling) (Garrett shushing) - You talk too much. Listen, we have to get out of this building. (Ann moaning) The only way they can pull this off is if nobody knows about it. - Is the building sealed off? - Yes, sir, no one can get in or out. - Good, where are they? - They're up on two. We'll find them, - Finish it. (suspenseful tempo music) (gun clicking) (gunshots booming) (man groaning) (Garrett yelling) (gunshots booming) (dramatic music) What's going on up there? - We've lost contact with three more men. - Wonderful. (suspenseful music) (police sirens alarming) - We got company. - Handle it. Come on. (dramatic tempo music) (Garrett gasping) (door creaking) - Hey, how you doing? - [Guard] Evening. Can I help you? - Yeah, I'm looking for somebody, you new around here? - I'm just filling in. Can I help you? - Yeah, I was supposed to get a call from Steve Rogers about an hour ago, you seen him? - I'm pretty sure everybody's gone home but I can check. Rogers, what department? - The guy's your boss, buddy. (ominous music) - There must be some mistake. (gunshot booming) (suspenseful music) (officer groaning) - No one. - Where's Turner? - Four, moving down. - All right, let's move up. You go first. (guns cranking) - Ready? (suspenseful music) - He's gotta be here. Let's move in. - Stay here. - I want the son of a bitch. - I said stay here. (suspenseful music) (Green snapping) (somber piano music) (ominous tempo music) You've caused me a great deal of trouble, Garrett! We had a deal! You broke it! For what? Some four-eyed piece of ass! You could've had all the ass in the world after this job but no! You had to have her! Come out, Garrett! Come on out and face me! I want you here when I rip her fucking heart out! (ominous beat music) (eerie music) (lights buzzing) (gunshots booming) (electricity buzzing) (papers rustling) (foreboding music) Beautiful. (suspenseful music) (gunshots booming) Garrett, no! I'm empty. - Let's go. - [Green] Where? - You're getting us out of here. (door buzzing) - You can't kill us all, Garrett. This thing's bigger than you. It's the whole damn country. It's the way it's gotta be. If we don't control it, there is no control. And all you get is chaos, a world run by psychopaths. - Yeah? Like me? (door thudding) - Hi there. - I had real plans for you, Garrett. Paint the walls with this loser. I'm going for the girl on the computer discs. - Yes, sir. (door clanking) I'm going to enjoy this. Move! You worthless piece of shit, you're nothing! (kick thudding) (Garret screaming) Oh, did that hurt? Aw, I'm all... (kick thudding) (Garret groaning) You ain't so fucking bad. (kick thudding) Piece of shit, get up! Get up! (suspenseful music) (kicks thudding) (Turner groaning) (kicks thudding) (Garrett groaning) - Fuck. (suspenseful music) (punches thudding) (smacks thudding) (leg crunching) (Turner screaming) (punch thudding) (Turner groaning) (ominous music) (knife swishing) (Turner grunting) Come on! (punch thudding) (Garrett growling) (stabs squelching) (bell ringing) - Garrett! (Ann moaning) Look at you, the happy couple together at last. You know, you were one of the best. This is such a waste. Now, put her down. (Ann moaning) I said, put her down. (heartbeat thumping) (Garrett grunting) I really do hate to do this. (knife swishing) (knife squelching) (ominous music) (distant police sirens alarming) (dramatic music) (police radio chattering) (boots stomping) (suspenseful music) (gun cranking) (Ann whimpering) - You're gonna be all right. - No, no, no, no! - No, don't leave me! No! Garrett! - No! (Ann whimpering) Don't worry about me! You just take care of yourself, you understand? (police radio chattering) - No! (ominous music) - [Garrett] Get her! - Garrett! No!
