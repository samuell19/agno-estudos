Make passage! This Ark was built to save us all. Have faith! You all believe this Ark is the only way to salvation! You've to believe us! Have faith! - Please, proceed! Hands up! Go on! No rush! Hats off! Go ahead! Have faith! Believe this Ark is the only way to salvation! Raise the anchor! We're moving towards the bright future! All who believe us will be saved! This film is dedicated to all the collaborators and actors who passed away prior to the premiere and who were thus never able to shoulder the burden of freedom. Goodbye, Christine! My little goose girl! Our little freedom! Goodbye! Why do you cry, father? I'm shedding tears over all the beauty which is perishing and turning into dust. Yes, everything returns to the beginning anyways. One day, we'll all fall asleep and during the slumber our dream will turn to reality. A new day starts at midnight. SEE YOU IN HELL, FRIENDS Try to recall where you met? Faster! It was here. - Here we first saw our Christine. Somewhere here was the beginning. - What beginning? - Try to remember! Try to remember, dad. If I'm supposed to recollect, I must close my eyes. Remembrance is like... a preparation for death. I recall this tree! - Go back! We missed it. Open your eyes or we'll fall asleep forever. - No! Open them! - I won't. - Dad, what are you doing? Pass me the wheel. - Don't wake me up! Don't wake me up! - Pass it over! Whoever once lived, he'll remain alive forever. See you in hell, friends! See you... see you... see you... where did he say? In hell. In hell? Is this supposed to be hell? Maybe it's paradise?! But how do the flames fit in? It's really fire. But it doesn't burn. Do I still dwell in the body? Maybe I've reached purgatory where the soul watches the film of its life?! Everything in this world is futile! Tell me, colonel, why do you live alone? Because... nobody survived by my side. If I'd run around with a target on my back as your peacock, colonel, would you shoot me? Why me? My conscience is already overloaded. If you perceive life as unbearable, end it yourself. My own end is already well-prepared long in advance. I'm only waiting to survive anyone and everyone who could engrave on my tombstone some unpalatable truths. Don't forget about the suit fitting! Expect me tomorrow! Peacock, postman and colonel. Those I've already seen. Or was I just told about them? But where am I? How come I can't remember anything? Truths. Truths. The unpalatable truths. Maybe it was even before our previous encounter?! Oh, our goose girl, Christine. It's our damaged car! Flames of hell. And this must be Rita. Let me push it back! But still expect lumps on your head. I feel terribly sorry but it wasn't my fault. Believe me it... Here somewhere, I should be present too?! Or was I cut out? Finally, me! Really a swell honeymoon trip! Let's move all your belongings into my car. I see you're runaways who are afraid of something. Don't worry, no tracks go beyond my threshold! On the colonel's estate we've found a perfect hiding place. Faraway from the boiling pot of all those dirty businesses and mass deceits. Memories are sprouting out of the hellish flames towards the divine light. But why? Being hungry and cold, why do I have to think of summer breeze and full stomach? Maybe because here it all started?! At my place, you're hidden before the world as in a grave. So! By the way, colonel, did you notice the little girl? The goose girl. Who is she? The geese are mine. But I live here alone. Oh, all alone? Only with my memories. But as long as my dad lived, he used to be hospitable to stray kids. However, one day, he sat on a bike and disappeared. Thus I don't know whether to cry for being an orphan, or an abandoned son. Sometimes I wake up during the night and I hear a persistent tinkling sound as if my past would encircle me on a bicycle. Did I scare your lady? Once we start to recollect, you'll shit your pants! Oh, I almost forgot about you! Then, you'd open your mouths wide a-a-a, stretch out your tongues e-e-e and pass away, my kitty babies. Do you think we escaped them? - Forget about the past. Somebody was ringing outside the whole night. My Rita! We're safely hidden here. - Rita! My beloved! - No, not here! Someone is over there, spying on us. Shh! Shh, I'll take a look. Is anybody there? We're all alone! Rita, my love! I'll do anything you want. Do you wish us to be happy? Do you wish? Yes. I'll make you a baby. You silly! Breastfeeding might ruin my figure. I wish a big baby, sweet-smelling. Oh, you're... Petras! Let's make a grown up baby, Petras. Rita, you're crazy. Fear is eating your brain. You promised to do anything I wish. If you refuse to make me such a baby, I'll approach the colonel. Try it! I doubt he's capable. He's old. He's. But the goose girl must have some relation to him, huh? Rita embodied two characters. She was tender and devoted, while sitting at the piano; hedonistic and possessive, while sitting on me. This dubious nature wholly permeated her. She could foresee what happens but by her crazy stunts she was concealing her premonitions. Who is it? Oh, a baby cot. So big. Let's see what's inside! OMG, they're coming! - What's on your head? I have to protect myself. The flies are all around! You know, flies are everywhere! I can only see a big, toothless baby and also its baby cot. No, no, please, miss... I need something from you! - ... don't get undressed. I need a big baby, a baby who can bite, swear and herd geese. Rita, leave him alone! Do you hear? Someone is there. Hey, who are you? What's your name? My name is Sour Ass. Believe it or not! How did I get here? What a night, huh?! Two people make a couple. What? And three make a family. A family? How did you like it, boys? - It was fine. I feel, as if I'd be a newborn child of yours. Something to drink? - No, thanks. You own a really nice house, colonel. We'll seriously consider your adoption. In the pond, one can even breed fish. Red nose means it's gonna be a girl. A little girl. Goose eggs? Try! To be in your place, I wouldn't laugh. Who was Sour Ass looking for last night? SOUR ASS, it must be a code! We must watch out! Maybe we're not alone here?! I must find out! OMG, where are you going? Come back! C'mon! I must investigate. Do investigate. But without a gun! Well? Go on! The postman's arrived. - Oh, I completely forgot about him. Hello! Good morning, colonel! You've got a client. I'll be right with you. Shouldn't a burial suit be black? Well, it's just a wrap. Who is over there? I didn't know, you had relatives?! - Nevermind, me neither. So, let's try the suit! And the lady upstairs. Who is she? - It's my bride. Yours? - Ours. Really? Yesterday I was all alone but today I'm getting married. You? - Me and Petras. I don't believe it. Don't play with feathers, Rita. What a nice name! Rita. Yes. Do you want to make a threesome. What a strange family! Why strange? Better strange than none. You see. Why do you bother, colonel, when you're at death's door. Besides, when the flood comes we'll be mudding in our graves. Mudding. Mudding. I'm freezing to the bone. How many years am I already dead? Where... Where do I crawl actually? Where am I heading? This toy reminds me of something. Ah so! My family. Our strange family. Father Matej! - Where are you? Father Matej! - Father Matej! - Where are you? Father Matej, we've come for a wedding rite. - Father Matej! Father Matej! - I'm glad to see you. We want to marry. And whom do you want to marry? - Both of them. Isn't it sinful? Maybe sinful but not boring! It's consecrated ground. Don't be blasphemous! Let's go. Don't judge! You've grown old but the world didn't stay still. It's so sad when young people remain alone. The more people we love, the better we are. Be a family! A growing family. And populate the world with living beings. Not only by memories. No! Don't be ashamed. It's natural. Be, all of you, together forever! I wish this from the bottom of my heart. The Lord is our witness! Cheers! Cheers! Don't cry. You've got married, you'll be fine. At least, she'll warm your body. Don't you like her? Like or dislike... I don't care. I'm only looking forward to death. Well, yes, after death it's swell. Now, you're talking nonsense, father Matej. You can get to know God but not what's after death. How can you make a fool of yourself in front of them? Have you died before? You haven't. Only when we die, can we know. - We all know already. We're only very fond of forgetting it. When your time comes, death will smile on you. Then, you should embrace death as your dearest lover. When I look at you, I really almost believe you are already eaten by worms. It's not the first time, we're on this world. Nor the last. Help! Help me! Help! The Reds! They're here too. So, I'm really alive. Neither the first time, nor the last. Welcome, sisters! Can we temporarily stay at your place? Come in. My sister is ill. We don't ask for your identity. We believe in your good intentions. Hey, Rita! Are you seeking your interest? No, your "interest". Why are you spying on us? - We aren't, we wouldn't dare. I see you've come from faraway. If you need to rest, my house is at your disposal. We don't like to bother you. But Christian duty demands you show us, as your guests, some hospitality! Tell me some news from the world, dear ladies. There isn't any news, thank God. And it's right as such! We don't need changes. Some obscurantists already got it and withdrew. Idea is right, people wrong! Even the wrong must pull the rope on the right side. If not, they've to be tied up. Well, people are mean and stupid. Without any change, they'll kill each other. They deserve the flood! Big flood! Do you have faith? Not many are truly faithful! Is she your daughter? Nope. I'm his wife. It's strange, right? And the other one. Is he your brother? Not at all. He's my husband too. We're trying our best to avoid boredom. If we sin or not, the world remains the same. Wherever we come, there are always some runaways. They are hiding from us like rats. But they can't escape us! Lord knows why He led our steps to this house. We've a task here. They've to experience, one can't escape justice. What about killing them in their sleep? They intend to kill us. They want to kill us! Time has come to sharpen the axes. Both of you wanna join me? This is too much rush! One has to enter the water like entering a woman. Think rather how to enter a grave! I've to tell you something. Soon, I expect to give birth to your child. Are you happy, boys? You seem surprised. Did she tell you before? - Why me? Don't be ridiculous. Maybe she's expecting twins?! You can keep one and I'll take the other. Twins! Do you feel them? Yes, I do! But only one. OMG, he can't feel his own offspring. Holy women! But skilful with the ax as an executioner. They're diligent like bees. They've cut down another tree. - Damn! You offered everything for their disposal, so suffer now! - Well, I did. But why do they cut down my trees? They need material. - For what? Nice, huh? - For the Ark! You predicted the flood. - I don't remember. Then, try to remember! I can't recall any such talk. Due to the flood, they're turning the house into an Ark. "People deserve a flood!" - I was just joking. Even Noah was derided for building an Ark. What if the sisters are tools of destiny? I don't want my house to be rebuilt. It's nether theirs, nor yours! It's mine, mine, mine! How come "yours"? Are we a void? You're family! And anything yours is mine too. Can I help you? Help yourself! I came to take a look at... - Aren't you ashamed? The Ark isn't ready yet. The flood doesn't wait. The flood just comes. Flood... Get lost! - C'mon! C'mon! The flood is flooding... I was only joking. I was only Joe-King. Time to wake up! Did you hear? It kicks! It moved. It wants to be born. It revolts, kicks and fights! I hope, you really get a baby. Do you realize... children bring worries with them? But they're also the salt of the earth. Rita embodied two characters. One dreaming and the other wakeful. Nobody had a clue which one prevails. She was dreaming about a goose girl. But it was not just a dream. The girl was a real one! I could see her too then. Hops! I've got you. Get up, dead guy! I'll wipe your eyes. It's gonna be fine! You'll be fine with us too. - What's up? Who are you? - It's him. So long we've not seen each other and you don't rejoice?! We want only to help you. - Help? Why? Hop! I don't need your help. Go to hell without me, witches! Why without you? Let's go, handsome! What do you want? Where is your ax? - In time, an ax becomes old-fashioned. But you deserve punishment! - What for? You killed. - I'm not a murderer. Blame the postman for all that happened. He chased me and made me a tool of his own suicide. He's the one who killed! Hey, Petras! How did you get all your bruises? Were you fighting nuns again? If you have an urge to take revenge, then shoot me instead! Are you crazy? You'll inherit a postal service with two assistants and all the undelivered letters. I don't know. Why? Why? I've no clue why you're looking forward to your own death with such joy? Because I'll go straight to heaven. Within the last twenty years, I haven't delivered a single bad message. It's because I never delivered a single message to anybody. Do you know? No news, is good news. Let's go! For twenty years I was supposed to be a messenger of vanity. And during the upcoming twenty years I'd be a messenger of death. I'd rather die myself. - It's not a reason to die. My life is a sheer emptiness. It's like an empty postal bag. I encountered only sadness in never-ending wars and persistent scorching heat. That's all I've got in my whole life. Think twice! - You yourself have second thoughts. When the sad ferryman asked about the end of his tiresome job, when he gets free, the answer was, "You're the son of a stupid mother." "To the first person who enters your boat, hand over the oar and jump overboard." I entrust to you a pile of sealed letters. Don't read them! Goodbye! What should I do with your assistants? From now on, they're yours. Goodbye! Goodbye! Shoot. Shoot! Fast! What a hit, boss! Bravo! Bravo! I did a good deed. He himself insisted I take over his postal "oar". So it goes in life. Something dies and something else is born. Hey, Petras! Call daddy! Daddy! Daddy! This is our daughter! Fight it hard! So, what do you say? Nice, huh? Do you like her? Mhm. Come to me, my goose girl. What's your name? - Whatever. C'mon, tell dad your name! - Christine. And I'm hungry. - Oh, our baby is hungry. We forgot to feed our little goose girl. So, bring some food. - I'll be right back. I'm hungry. Food is on the way. Faster, grandpa, faster! He isn't grandpa, He's dad. Who is grandpa then? - Both are your fathers. Fathers! What folks did you let in, my son. Don't forget the house isn't just yours. A cop! Sour Ass! Dooshbag! Lusting for a woman! Are you gonna feed all the foreign bastards now? Whom do you serve? Who hired you? Why are you running away from me? I got tired of the world so I'm back. Get lost! I'm not gonna sleep outdoors! Get lost! I'm your father! - Liar! Who hired you? I didn't teach you to handle a gun so you could later shoot me! You're lying, cop! My father is long dead. Run out of ammo, huh? Is this the way to welcome dad, dooshbag? I'll give you such a big blow you'll land in the yard. Do you really refuse to recognize me? Oh... yes, you start to seem familiar. The chin, the hat... The colonel was not at all sure this was his father but we needed a grandpa. Why reject him... - My wife! ... when he was so eager to join the family?! I've found my dad in the attic. Cute! I must take a closer look. Teeth seem all-right. Grandpa, I'm Christine. But you can call me Christushka too. Who is this tot? What's "tot"? It's like saying "you lovely little devil". When you left the world, you said to never come back. So, don't be surprised. I made the house legally belong to me. Traveling was swell, my son, but the old man should lay his bones below the three in his native soil. You completely changed during your absence. Only your hat is the same. Well, even the hat is different. Look at those two saints. They've the witches' gaze! They won't leave on their own. Christine! Grandpa! What are you doing there? They can't stop laughing there. Maybe they laugh at us?! We're laughable perhaps. What's laughable about us? I don't get it. - Well, you're utterly laughable. Grandpa was telling me about hell. - About hell? What did he tell you about hell? - All kinds of funny stuff. Like... - Grandpa, where are you? What people do in hell? - They get bored there like this... He's gone. - Childish guy. Maybe he jumped out of the window. - Out of the window? - Let's get dressed. Okay? As if the girl could rejuvenate him. Let's go! The post can't wait. - Hail to the post! My boys! I don't look much like your dad. And where is your young wife? She's out there. See you! Be back for lunch. So, here I am. Grandpa, wait for me! All my limbs are still functional. Wait. Grandpa, I saw everything! You did? Christa! My little Christine! What are you doing here? So... have you seen how babies are made? By your pee-thing! Finally, we were like a holy family. Ritaaaaa! Ritaaa! Only thanks to Rita and her prophetic dreams, those two fanatics of the bright future didn't succeed in taking us right to heaven. Catch me! Wait. Don't run away. Where is she? - I don't know. I couldn't find her. - And the kid? Wait. - I'm coming. - Don't laugh. C'mon! Will we play? - Don't laugh. - Ow! No! No! - Don't fear, Rita! - Look how splendid our Ark is! Your whole mansion... has been rebuilt into an Ark of Salvation. All onboard will be saved! Your bodies, your souls and your children. Children too! No, not the children! No! Spare the children! My little baroque angel! My Christine! My baby! My precious baby! I'll show you the Ark, witches! Now, you'll show your true colors. Colonel! - What's up? What happened? I had a terrible dream. - It's gone! All is fine! Move! It was so frightening. Blood was scattered everywhere! The happier we are, the more horrifying dreams I have. I'm scared! These two are haunting my dreams. Who did this? Who painted the poor animal? You desecrated the color red! You criminals! Blasphemers! You'll pay for this! You'll see! - Very soon. My dad did it. He's an anarchist. We should isolate him! They hate us. - We shouldn't provoke them. He might confess love, saying, "Oh, I love you, my darling." And your response, sweetface? Show me your bird! Great! Whatever you learn in youth, in maturity, you'll appreciate. Learn, learn, learn! Stop it, old codger. You rotten fornicator! Leave the kid alone. Don't be afraid, Christine. - No, give me a break. - We'll play. - Let me go. Come with us. - Let me go with grandpa! - We've nice toys. Come! Put your hands off her. Go fuck yourselves! Come! Wait, witches! I'm not done yet. Run! My leg! Go! Let's go! Now! Did you see? Beware of me, witches! Oh, dad, such crazy ideas! As if two fools wouldn't be enough! Now, you're going mad too. He's a troublemaker. I urged you not to provoke them. But you don't take any advice. Always, doing things your way! Bullshit! My fault is I'm too good. But I swear, it's over. Why are you looking at me? Am I concerned? You're not. Because nobody cares! The machine gun with all the ammunition disappeared from the attic! So, now, tell me how do we get the two Ark builders out of the house? Or do you wanna wait for the flood? Put down your weapons! Give back the machine gun! Then you can leave in peace! I know you can hear me. You have one hour to do it. No negotiations! If we didn't fight back, you'd kill us all. We'd be hanged, our throats cut, we'd end up as cattle in the slaughterhouse, as all those who believed you. You didn't grasp anything! You'd no clue about the time spirit. It was a war of two sides. A mortal combat! Killing anyone, even during the war, is just murder. Murder is always a crime! I can hardly be a killer if you're still alive, witches. Not the first time we died then. Neither the first time! Giddy-up! And nor the last time. Hey! What's up? - Shh! Listen. Hey! They're playing. We wanted to live like one big family but you rejoiced only when we were afraid. Again having bad premonitions? You never smiled or laughed. You relished only our fear. You were never happy. You only pretended being happy. And you only pretended being nuns. We got him! You promised paradise to all. And what was the reality? I'm strong and muscular like the mighty hero Hercules. We're bold like Joan of Arc and we'll smash your Ark to pieces. The notion of a bright future was just a deception. Catch it! When we discovered your true nature, we started to role-play as you did. We turned against you your own weapons. You killer! Why did you kill her? We should hang you all as dogs. I hate all of you. I hate you! Now, I'm curious if your teaching will survive you. What happened to them? The evil aunties fell asleep? Yes, we're free to play again. - Hurrah! Are they heavy, grandpa? - Heavy as their sins! The room they used has to be consecrated. Keep on moving, witches! This is the highway to hell. You preached about the flood, so here it is. One. Two. Three. All around reigns the flood! Make yourself ready! You've to believe us! We're building the Ark for your own good, to save you all. Our high esteemed steersman Noah knows the right direction. We all are equal. We're one big family! All the possessions are our common asset. After hearing the signal, make a line and enter the Ark orderly one by one. Leave your luggage at the appointed spot. You wanted to get into hell, so here you are! I'm thirsty. Our Ark... You don't need anything anymore. Let's go, sis! Have faith! Believe this Ark is... His pockets are empty. Look under his coat. What's this figure? Oh, just a toy. Hell! It's our ultimate meeting point. Hey, buddy! Is this all you have? Look! Show more respect! Don't you know me? - Should I? And who are you? - We? We? We're the postmen. I was a postman. And you're my assistants. What? We? Your assistants? Hail to the post! My boys! My boys! Do you... really... remember anything? It's Rita! Don't stare at me! - You resemble one woman. Rita! - It's me. Then you're my wife. Wife? Once, we loved each other. Do you want me? Then come closer! Don't be afraid of my belly. It kicks. You haven't changed at all. May the Lord be with us! Do you remember? It was also your idea. I don't. Don't you remember our baby? A boy? We had a boy, huh? No, a girl. Our little goose girl, our Christine. Our... - ... sweet freedom. Mhm. She was crucified. And therefore the world is so sad. Try to remember! I can only recall the bad moments. We couldn't be absolutely happy. Our mutual happiness was only pretended. Oh, happiness! We just wanted to suppress the reality. Thank God, we got to know father Matej who lived long enough in the world that he was able to become human. Father! - Oh, children, what did you do?! "Thou shalt not kill," is the foremost of imperatives given by God to humanity. Hi! Bow down before the Cross to prevent the blood of your foes dropping on your heads. We rejoice! As Abraham put his son on the altar instead of prayer, make your plea through your child. Maybe the Lord will hear its voice?! Confess all your sins in front of the Holy Cross! Repent! So, you could regain joy later. My dear, how do you feel in your sufferings? It's fine, grandpa. Soon I'll be in heaven! Ask her how long it's suppose to take. How soon? Once God wakes up! When does it happen? You'll get a clear sign from the Lord! The sun will disappear and complete darkness prevails. Many regiments of angels will descend and flames of the Holy Spirit will fill our hearts with courage to act rightfully. God is kind to his children! They want Him to play with and He mercifully does so. Change for the better and be like children! Let's run out into the world to relieve it of poverty and temporality! We aren't here only for our own sake but for others who live and die in darkness. Be praised Jesus Christ, the leader of the righteous! The Lord is giving us a sign! A sign! We are forgiven! We are forgiven. God forgave us! - We're happy again. We'll bring the world from upside down back to normal. And we'll make it reasonable as it never was before. Drink with us, Christine! We're happy. Why just us? I'm sick of this hypocrisy. Now, I'll read you something which will tarnish your happiness. My dear sister, I'm bound to my bed as holy Lazarus and I'm dying. If anyone would be around, it'd be easier because I just can't get to my feet. I'd need someone to bring me bread and to milk the goat who is dying too. It's sad, my dear sister, but an old person is helpless. Life was heavy and death won't be easier. May the Lord protect our poor souls! Regards, your sister Anastasia. So? Don't you remember anymore, we tried to imitate God? To bring justice into the world! I recall, we went somewhere, there was a pile of money... we intended to help someone but I can't say to whom and why? This we remember even though we didn't witness it. We were with you even though staying at home. It seems to me now, it was in a different life. Those who live must be righteous. Mhm. Righteous not only to themselves but towards anyone and everyone! The postman was right. I shouldn't have opened the undelivered letters. By opening just a single one, our conscience was dragging us back to the world we escaped before. The lamentation of an old lady fueled the desire for justice again. To take from the rich and give to the poor! From behind! Get closer! Cu-ckoo. Come! Strongbox! Here is the strongbox. Bags! Crowns! And roubles too! - Here are some more bags. Oh, Christine! Are you stealing, comrades? Remember! It's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for you, with your strongbox, to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Thieves! Let's retreat! Back me up! They stole money! We were robbed! Stop or you're dead! Learn shooting, fucking clerics! Return what you stole, asshole! Wait! It's a bad omen. Chase him away! - Let's go back. A single red donkey can't block our pathway to equity! Get lost! Go about your business! Go rather ask where does poor old Anastasia live? Give me a break, dad! I won't ask anybody. We should go straight back home! On the run, we lost half the money anyway. Coward! He's a coward - I'm not, I'm a symbolic figure. - Of course! And besides... A symbolic figure is never an escapist. Why do you wear a gun? To use against crooks who rob churches. How do you treat them eventually? - It depends. I'd shoot them like dogs! Such rascals don't deserve anything better! Dirty thieves! Hurry up, Petras! Move it! We can't stay incognito here for long. Let's go! Faster! Wretched of all the world unite! My boy, where is the dwelling place of the old lady Anastasia? Screw you! Let's open the gate! Let's go in! It's here, maybe?! Praised be Jesus Christ, Anastasia! What do you want? We bring luck to your home! Finally, you made a fortune! Look, granny! So much money! Lord of Heaven Himself is sending this cash! Are you crazy? Are we? We are. And why is He sending such crumpled banknotes? This I call gratitude! - Do you know where to go? Mhm. Where did you send him? - To bring a bottle. I want to show hospitality. Sit down and wait a minute! Meanwhile, you can count your cash. Grandpa, look there, uphill! Oh, betrayal! Get up! Fast! Let's leave! We're being encircled! Everyone out! They're on our tail. Ugh, you cunning bitch! Guys, we must get to the road! All of you will end in hell! Surrender! Thieves! - Kill them! Death to the wicked! Come here! Here is an exit! They want to rape me! Go fast! Immediately, get out! Fuck off! Throw it! Fear not! Now, I'm in command! And not my cowardly son. Don't let them escape! Kiss my ass! Hurrah! Now, straight home! - Speed up! We won! Victory! We won! Yippee! We won! We did it! We're home. Christine! Christine, wake up. C'mon, girl! Hey! Stop it! Come here. Shh, stop! - Come and help me. What happened? She's not moving. Carefully. - Carefully! What's up? Christa! Christine! Wake up, girl! Good grief! She's... she's dead. Christine! - It's the end. Christine! Little Christine! The end! All ends are the same! The innocent always pay for justice. That's why even Christ was crucified. But He has risen from death. Because people need miracles to be able to live. Don't we witness too many miracles? The girl hasn't got a single wound or scratch on her body. What was the cause of her death then? Just take a look! Check it! It was her. She killed the girl! No! We all killed her. All of us! You killed her. Not everyone! It wasn't me. Not me! Everyone! Why did she die then? We defiled the Cross! We crucified her. All of us! Everyone! You too! Coward! Don't touch her! We are all guilty! Are we really guilty? Yes, we are. She died of a broken heart through grief. Due to our indifference. We forgot everything! Do you remember? All the names by which we called her. Little Christine, Our Freedom, Our Salvation. We won't be redeemed. Our hope fell asleep forever. Now, it seems to us that time stagnates, as we do. But time doesn't stand still. Even when death comes! Not even when we remember. After all, we can't truly live without recollection. Even now when you close your eyes, don't you see our little girl more beautiful than she really was? Aren't we most happy now? Yes, we are. We all die. God weeps and will recollect. "Silly creatures," He sighs, "what a big family they made!" "They loved each other so much! I almost believe they were happy." God weeps, a rainbow is made and people say, "What a beautiful day!" Life is an image, dream and sigh! Maybe we should start from scratch again?! But without mistakes! - Yes, dad, without any mistakes. Life is a dream! Dream! Yes, our life is a dream. Take revenge on God for the death of an innocent child! Death for death! Life for life! Death for death! Life for life! Let's revenge! Revenge! Death for death! Life for life! What are you doing? Stop it! She isn't dead. She lives! Christine, open your eyes! Try it again! Christine! Christine! Child, I command thee, get up and embrace your mother! Oh, Lord, why are you making a fool of your old servant when he needs You the most? Be ready! Have faith! We're building the Ark for your own good, to save you all. Our high esteemed steersman Noah... Pity, father Matej isn't here. He's with us all the time! We're one big family! Father Matej is here? He sleeps. He doesn't want to be associated with this epoch. Is this against flies? Wake him up! Let him perform a miracle! Father Matej! Help us! Wake up! He'll wake up on his own when the time comes. Father Matej! Father Matej, get up! Father, why did God forsake us? Why is hell our destination? Because you expect someone else will make a miracle, someone pure and innocent as Jesus Christ. But only children are without sin in this world. Wake up everyone! Only children are pure and righteous. Wake up and be like children too! Let the light in! Hey, wake up! Get up! Folks, wake up and remember! Get up! Wake up! Run out into the world to relieve it of poverty and temporality! We aren't here only for our own sake but for all those lost and dying in darkness. Folks, break it up! C'mon, don't you hear? Be righteous! But only children are without sin in this world. Only children are pure and righteous. Wake up and be like children too! We'll bring the world from upside down back to normal. And we'll make it reasonable as it never was before. God punishes by making the person reasonable. Our children are back with us! Hail to our revolution! We have only bare hands! We have only bare hands! We have only bare hands! We have only bare hands! Close the Ark! Close our Ark! All the wretched of the world unite! Mom! - Christine, my child! My girl! My goose girl! Our savior! My little girl! - I'm not little anymore. I'll be right back. Bye, mom! Wait! Wait! Everyone, get on! Everyone, get on! Rita, get on! Rita, where are you? Let's go! Praise God of our forefathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob! Do you remember this hat? I've lost you once already. Stick to me now! Praise the car of Abraham, Isaac... We're leaving! - Get in! - Let's go! Stop! Join us now! Join us now! Stay here! You can't escape yourselves! We went through this already! Do you want to end up in hell again? Petras, come with us! Wait for me! Jump in! Do you really recall anything? Don't play smart ass or you'll walk! Oh, how to be wise when eternal truths cease to apply? All the Arks once turn into ashes and dust. In mild flame, our world of today is turning into the past. Something ends and something else starts. It's not the first time we're on this world, neither the last time. Hail to the revolution! What do you think? Is this a dream or reality? Every true miracle looks like a dream. We're realistic and thus we dream! We're all the same. And we'll never learn! Thank God! We're all looking for a country, where we can be born. The place with a grave and cradle, somewhere high, where only a dream can fly, where the dream flies. Farewell on the path without end which perpetually starts. Whenever strongholds are crushing and flags burning, a fool will again start to build the Ark for all of us. So, where is our next meeting point, friends? Where is our next meeting point, friends? In hell or in heaven, once we'll make a big reunion, the last reunion, our last big reunion. One starts clean and innocent, ends up wretched and lost. It's the rule of searching! It won't change, while the sun and time exist. It's the rule within us. Old crosses and new weepings, all the slogans will wash out the rain. How many dead angels, how many pilgrims, embarked on the path? You're one of them! Don't look back but go on!
