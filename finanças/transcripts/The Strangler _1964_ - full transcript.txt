Hello. Helen. Helen, you all right? - Is the one who reported this here? - Yes. - You Rosten? You called in? - Yes. - Can you identify her? - She's Helen Lawson. - How do you know that? - We're gonna be married. - What are you doing here this time of the night? - She was expecting me to call. She picked up the phone. I thought she screamed. I couldn't be sure. - Why not? - Because it sounded like the phone dropped. I tried to call back again. The line was busy. - So you decided to come over here on your own. Is that it? - Yeah, I guess so. - Get this on paper, Mack. - Lieutenant. The lab sent this over. - Find anything? - No. Same as the others. - Yeah, that's par for the course. - What'd you expect, fingerprints? - No, but I just wish once they'd find something. Lint, blood, fingernail. - You wanna hold onto this? - No. Send it back to the lab. - Here's the first autopsy report. - Sanford didn't waste any time. Must be the milk truck. - Yeah, right on time. The usual lieutenant? - Thanks, Mack. - Frank. - MO card? - Identical routine. - I didn't need an IBM machine to tell me this. Helen Lawson, nurse, 25 garrotted by her own stocking. That makes number eight for the strangler. - Yeah, it looks that way. - The medical examiner sent over the preliminary autopsy report. Girl wasn't raped. There was no evidence of maltreatment after death. - Well, what the hell does he get outta killing? - Room service. - I'll give you a recommendation. - Is it sour? - No, but my stomach is. - All the men's reports are in here. I typed them up in a summary. As usual, the murder took place in an apartment house. No one saw any strange characters, heard any commotion. There was no indication of forced access to the apartment. Nothing was stolen. Helen Lawson was a respectable girl, no tramp. - Where'd she work? - The Kramer Poly Clinic Hospital. Before that, a few others. - These things are supposed to help keep you awake. A little sleep wouldn't be bad either. All right. Helen Lawson had to be seen at some time by her killer. Probably where she worked. - Well, we checked out the hospitals, clinics, and sanitariums the other time. Beefing, Mack. There's nearly a million people around here, and we've only checked 4000 of them so far. - What makes you think it's gonna be any different this time? - I don't think it's gonna be any different. I just hope. - Diagnosis just called. They wanted to know if we'd run off those tests. - I haven't had time. - Well, they're waiting. - I'll get to them. - All right. Oh, I meant to tell you. You're supposed to report to the administration office. - Why? - Dr. Morgan's orders. All male employees are supposed to go. I guess the police are here again. - All right. - And all the while, they say nothing's getting done. And don't stay too long. I can't finish these tests myself. - All right, send the next one in, please. These two detectives want to ask some questions, Mr. Kroll. Sit down. I've assured them that everyone at Tilton will cooperate. - Do you have much contact with the other departments in the hospital, Mr. Kroll? - Not much. Most of my work is done in the lab. - Where do you live? - I have an apartment in the plaza area. - Are you married? - No. - You live alone? - My father's dead. My mother's living. - Are you familiar with Kramer Poly Clinic Hospital? - Naturally, I know of it. - Have you ever been there? - No. Do you know anybody that works there, or has worked there? - No. - Do you know a girl by the name of Helen Lawson? - Nope. - She was a nurse who worked at Kramer Poly Clinic Hospital. She was strangled last night. - I know. I read about her in the morning paper. - She also worked here at Tilton General about six months ago for a short time. Did you know her then? - I said I didn't know her. I might have seen her at a distance. If I did, I didn't know who she was. - Where were you last night, Mr. Kroll, between nine and midnight? - I was home. - Was your mother home too? - My mother's a cripple. She can't go anywhere. - Any other questions, Mel? - No. That'll be all. Thank you Mr. Kroll for your cooperation. - I wish I could have been more helpful. - All right, next. - Hello? Is this Mr. Kroll? - I'm Leo Kroll. - Oh, this is Clara Thomas, your mother's nurse. She wants to talk to you. - You're coming to see me tonight, Leo? I've been waiting and waiting. - Yes, Mom. I know. But I just got home. I had to work late at the hospital tonight. - Oh, please Leo, please. - No, Mom. I'm tired. I'm going straight to bed. - Oh, Leo, it's not asking too much. - Mom, I said I'm tired. I'm going to bed. I'll see you tomorrow night. - Leo. - Goodbye, Mama. - Leo! - Well, look who's here, old Dead Eye himself. Boy, could the Giants ever use you. - Hello there. We haven't seen you around lately. - Oh, just going by. Thought I'd stop. Been a couple of weeks. - One week, two weeks. What difference does it make? Every time you come by, there goes another prize. - It's just luck. - I'm glad you win. We like to keep our customers happy. - Well, not too happy, Tally or we'd be out of business. - Well, look at Las Vegas. When somebody wins there, it's good advertising. - Tally's the business brains around here. I'm just a relief girl. Every time somebody wins, I take it as a personal insult. - Barbara just wants to keep her job. - You are not leaving, are you? I thought I'd take a couple of chances. - Oh boy. Here we go again. - You want me to stay around and watch you win? All right, but just for you. - Thanks. - Boy, look at that man go. - You know you're awfully good at this. - You live around a ballpark or something? - I don't live anywhere in particular. I travel all over the country. I only get through here once or twice a month. - It's a good thing you don't live here. We'd go broke. - I think it's wonderful to do things well. - It's not important. It's only a game. - Oh, game or not, a lot of people go through their whole lives and never do anything really well. - When I was little, I had a horseshoe game, rubber horseshoes. I used to practice with it all the time. - I'll bet you with a neighborhood champ. - Nope. - What's the matter? Couldn't beat your dad? - I only played against my mother. - Against your mother? - It was very important to me to be better than she was. - I don't understand. Why was it so important? - Because whenever I wanted to do something, she'd do it for me, or she'd. It's not worth trying to explain. - She sure would be proud of you now. You won. So be our guest. - I'll take a doll. - Which one? - That one. - Well, at least you don't take the most expensive prizes. - Just dolls. You must have a regular collection of them by now, huh? - I give them away. I have lots of nieces. - I better take my break now. Come back and see us the next time you're in town. - I'll do that. - Bye-Bye. - Goodbye, Tally. - You married? - It's getting late, Mrs. Kroll. Better get you up and ready. Here you are. - I don't want a jacket. He can take me the way I am. - Oh, come now, Mrs. Kroll. You wanna look nice for your son. - Leo doesn't care what happens to me, or what I wear. - He does care. He told me he comes to visit you every night. - He does not come every night. Sometimes he misses several nights a month. - Most sons wouldn't come that often. - Well, he better. He doesn't have anything more important to do. Ooh, he's ungrateful. Clara, I tell you, I've been a mother and a father to that boy. - Everyone has to grow up, Mrs. Kroll. Even your son. - Oh, don't talk to me about growing up. I'm old and I know it. But I used to be pretty. When Leo was a little boy, he thought I was beautiful. - You're still very pretty, Mrs. Kroll. - Oh, he knows he's supposed to be here at 7:30. Now, what time is it? - Almost eight. Now don't upset yourself, Mrs. Kroll. You'll have to go to bed. Remember what happened yesterday? - I'm gonna give him a piece of my mind just the same. You're late. Where have you been? - I stopped to get these. - You haven't kissed me yet. - I know, Mama. - That's no way to kiss your mother. - Yes, I know, Mama. - Oh stop it. Yes, I know, Mama. You sound like a parrot. - I'm sorry, Mother- - Oh, you're the most aggravating I don't know what. Don't you love your mother?? - Of course I do. I'll put these in water. - That's my boy. You love me, and I love you. - Now, let's roll me out into the corridor, and we'll have a nice talk. - All right, Mama. What do we have to talk about that's new? - You didn't come to see me last night. Where were you, Leo? - I had to work late, Mama. - Oh, well then you see? Then you don't know what happened to me, so we do have something to talk about. - What happened? - You don't really want to know. Oh, Leo. You're smoking too much. You're just like your father, always overdoing. He died from alcohol. - What were you going to tell me? - About what dear? - Whatever it was you thought was so important. It happened last night. - Yes. Leo, your mother nearly died. My heart, Leo. It nearly gave out. And you didn't come. - What happened? - I don't know, dear. They won't tell you what really happened. I fainted, and it was like there was a knife in my heart. That's all I remember. And if Clara hadn't found me right away and given me a hypo, I would've died, Leo, right then. - You're very lucky, Mama. - I was lucky. But next time I might not be so lucky. Oh, Clara. Clara, this is my son Leo. I was just telling him about you. Leo, this is Miss Thomas. He wants to thank you for saving his poor old mother's life. I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Kroll, from your mother. - I haven't seen you before. - I was on the day shift until yesterday. Now I'm four until midnight. So I'll still be around to keep an eye on you. She kept me from dying, Leo. If anything happened to Clara, I don't know what I would do. I'd just die. She saved my life, Leo. - I won't forget. - Yes? - Miss Thomas, may I see you please? Who is it? - I'm Leo Kroll. Please, it's urgent. - Is something wrong with your mother? Wait just a minute. Did something happened to Mrs. Kroll? She was sleeping when I left the sanitarium. - I wanted to talk to you about her. Is it true, she's very ill? - Really, Mr. Kroll, you ought to discuss that with her doctor. - But you saved her life, didn't you? - Possibly. But we can talk about that some other time. Mr. Kroll, I know you're worried about your mother. But as long as I'm there, I'll take good care of her. - If it weren't for you, she'd be dead now. - It sounds as if you, you'd like to have your mother dead. - No. No. No! Mama. Mama. Mama. Mama. - What do you make of it, Frank? - I don't know. Perhaps it means something, perhaps not. - That doll is the only thing in this room that's been moved or broken. - That doll was deliberately thrown against the wall and smashed. - Well, who threw it? The strangler or Clara Thomas? - The girl could have thrown it at the strangler in self defense. But that mark's pretty deep. I doubt it. - Well, could it be someone else? - Who? Why? I don't think so, Mack. The last two people in this room were Clara Thomas and the strangler. I'm going down to the car to phone. As soon as they finish dusting this, have them put the parts together and take it to the lab. Try to trace down where it was sold. - And who bought it? - That's right, Mack. Who bought it? Call for Detective Posner on line 61. - Posner. Well, he's at it again. - That makes number nine for the strangler. But it's been less than a week since the last one, Lieutenant. - You're telling me. This one's name was Clara Thomas, a nurse at Park Sanitarium. I want you to run out there and run down everyone who works there, or has worked out there in the past year. You got that? - Got it. Also, check the patients, relatives, visitors, anyone who would've access to the hospital. - Yes, sir. Do I get any help? Take all the available men in the office to help you with the interrogation. Mack Clyde will meet you out at the sanitarium. I want you to make a master list of all of the names. And I want it quick. - Mean to say you didn't hear it on the newscast? How could you have missed it? - I never listen to newscasts. - Well, maybe you're not interested. You're a man. He never kills men. - May I have more slides please? - I'm a woman, a nurse. - You are not a nurse. - Well, how would he know the difference? I work in a hospital. He always kills nurses, and I'm scared. Do you know what I do? You're not listening. Do you know what I do? - What? - I carry a hat pin. Look at me. If he ever tried to touch me, I'd let him have it right in the eyes. - That's nice. - I have a girlfriend, Norma. She carries a little tear gas thing. Looks something like a, like a test tube. Do you know what they told me at my drug store? They told me that a lot of the women in the neighborhood have been buying bottles of acid to carry in their purses. - That's interesting. - There's a lady in my building that builds booby traps with milk bottles, all around the windows and doors. If he ever tried to get in there, he'd make an awful racket. - Now that's stupid. - And why is that so stupid? - Do you think he'd try to get in to a strange apartment without looking first? - Well, he can't see in the dark, like a cat. - Can you be sure, Thelma? I'm going to lunch. I'm hungry. - I've checked it thoroughly, Frank. The MO appears much the same. Death and suffocation, strangling. But it seems to me there are some differences. - What differences? - Take a look at these, these photos of some of the victims. That one you're looking at is the fifth victim. Eyes closed, almost relaxed. Stocking tied around her neck. No marks or bruises. That's number three. It's the same. Now you're looking at number eight, Helen Lawson a week ago. Still the stocking. Still no signs of violence. Well, there's no need to look through all of them. They're the same, except for our last ones. Clara Thomas, take a look. - No stocking. Why he would he use his hands this time? - Right. You put your finger on an important point. It seems as if he was infuriated with her. - The other victims, he left no marks. He arranged the body in a fairly normal position, even closed the eyes, and composed the features. - So why did it change? Does it mean anything? Could he have had anything personal against Clara Thomas? - That's the same setup. She wasn't mistreated after death. She could have fought the killer a little harder, but that doesn't make sense either. She wasn't as a large a woman as some of the others, and certainly not as strong. - Apparently not. I don't think it was the case of her resisting the killer, anyway. I can offer an opinion about that. Would you care to hear it? - What's that? - Want some milk? - Yeah, thanks. - Well, after strangling her, the killer would've been compelled, emotionally, to follow his usual pattern, repeat the grizzly ritual he's worked out. But. Well, let me put it this way. His heart wasn't in it. Well now that's a miserable expression to you, as I know. But it describes what I mean. - What do you mean? - Well, maybe he didn't kill Clara Thomas for the same twisted reasons that he killed the other women. And after she was dead, something happened, something to make him change his mind completely. And so he left, and probably in a hurry. - All right. So far so good. What about the doll in her apartment? - That broken toy? Could be more than a toy. Could be a fetish. - Fetish? - It's not uncommon, transference of emotion from one thing to another. Fetish can be anything, any non-sexual object that incites erotic feelings, whether it sticks, stones, piece of clothing. In this case, a doll. - Why a doll? - I can't tell you that. - Doc, you're a psychiatrist. You're supposed to know the reason. - Well, sure. But I don't have a crystal ball. Have you? - No. Maybe I better get one. - Mr. Kroll? We're police officers. - Come in. - We'd like to have you come down the station. - I haven't done anything. - Well, we're not accusing you of anything. We just want to ask you some questions. - Well I have to go to work. You have a warrant? - No, but this officer can wait here until I come back with one. - We might as well get it over with. It would be nice not having to go to work for once. Do you mind if I get my jacket? - No, go right ahead. Oh, excuse me. These rubber gloves belong to you? - Certainly. Who do you think they belong to? - Use them in your work? - All the time. Acids, reagents. Sometimes I stuff a pair in my pocket when I'm washing up by mistake. Can I have them back? - Sure. - They're charged against me, you know. And how many times did you say you had met Clara Thomas? - Just once. - And how many times did you meet her outside the hospital? I never saw her outside. - Seems to be doing pretty well for himself. - He asked for it. - Didn't you talk to Clara Thomas the night she died? - Nope. - You saw her at the sanitarium that night before she died? - Nope. I didn't visit my mother that night. - Why didn't you? - I worked late. I felt like I was catching a cold. I went home and straight to bed. Didn't you get up later, get dressed and go out? - Nope. - He ought to be about finished by now. He's been in there over an hour. - And that was the same night that you brought home the rubber gloves? - I don't know. I bring a pair home every once in a while. Don't you need them at the lab? - Yes, but I have several other pair at the hospital. - Didn't you go to Clara Thomas's apartment around midnight? - Nope. I have no idea where she lives. - Didn't you believe that you had a good reason to kill her? - Nope. - Didn't you in fact kill her? - Nope. - That'll be all, Mr. Kroll. - Keep Kroll in there. - Okay. - Well, what do you think? - Frankly, I don't see any marked reactions. I'd like a chance to study his graph though. - Well, can't you give me an opinion? Is he lying or not? - Can't you give me a few minutes to try to decide? - Sorry. Few questions I'd like to ask Kroll myself. Mel. Mel, let me have your notebook. It says here that after the death of Helen Lawson, you were questioned at the Tilton General Hospital. - Yes, along with all the others. - You were questioned by Sergeant Clyde. And a detective named Posner was along to take down these notes. Do you remember them? - Vaguely. - Well, they're the same two men who brought you here today. - I didn't know their names. - That's Sergeant Clyde seated there. Do you remember what you told him last week? - What do you want me to remember? I talked to many things. - I'm going to read what was said regarding Helen Lawson. Where were you last night, Mr. Kroll, between nine and midnight? You said you were at home. - Yes. - Earlier you said that your mother was alive, but your father was dead. - That is correct. - Then you were asked if you lived alone. You inferred that you were living with your mother. - No, I'm sorry. I did not. - But you didn't say that your mother had been living at the Park Sanitarium for two years, did you? - I guess not, but Sergeant Clyde didn't ask me that either. - When Sergeant Clyde did ask you, quote, "Where were you last night Mr. Kroll, between nine and midnight?" You replied, and again, I quote. "My mother is a cripple Mr. Clyde, she can't go anywhere."” Is that what you said? - If you say so. - And did you want Sergeant Clyde to believe that you'd been with your mother all night? - No, I did not. What I meant was that I spend nearly every evening with my mother. If Mr. Clyde got the wrong idea, I'm sorry. I meant at the hospital, not at home. - What it means is, you don't have an alibi. - If I were guilty, I'd arrange to have an iron clad alibi. - It says here you went to college for two and a half years. - I couldn't afford to complete my medical education. But I have sufficient training to be a policeman. - Lieutenant, I know you wanted this fast. All I can say is there are no pronounced disturbances in Kroll's graph. Evidently he wasn't disturbed by any of the questions. I'm sorry, but there's not enough evidence here to indicate to me, or you, or anybody else that the man is lying. - All right. Clyde, stay here with Kroll. I want to talk to Dr. Sanford. - Doc? Are you Clarence Sanford? - Yes. - I have read many of your books in abnormal psychology. It helps in my work, you know. - I'm flattered, Mr. Kroll. - Eggerton said the test was not conclusive. - I gathered that. - There he is now. You're sure you read that right? - I was just dead filing it. Maybe the doc can read more into it than I can. - Well, I wouldn't put too much faith in the polygraph test anyway, Frank. - He volunteered to take that test, Doc. - Well, whoever your killer is, he's a man to whom a lie detector test probably means very little. - What do you mean? - Well, in my opinion, your killer is a schizophrenic, with a personality split right down the middle. Consequently, he's able to lie a lie detector blue in the face, because he has absolutely no sense of guilt. - Trouble is, we don't know what he looks like, not on the outside anyway. If you can tell me what he looks like on the inside. - I can try, but only in generalities. A few facts are fairly obvious. As I said before, your strangler's a schizo, paranoid schizophrenic. Your man has a deep underlying hatred for women by nature, probably due to hatred of his own mother, or some woman close to him. She may be dead or even still alive, but he feels she's mistreated him or cheated him some way. - Do you have any idea how old he is? - Between 19 and 25, possibly up to 30. That's the age bracket when most schizos erupt into violence. - Lieutenant, about that Mama Doll. I've checked it out with both the manufacturers and the distributors. No dice. - All right. Start checking the retailers. - Right. Oh, what about Kroll in there? Clyde wants to know what to do with him. - Send him home. - Yes, Lieutenant. - Good night, Mrs. Kroll. Mr. Kroll. I was hoping you'd be here this evening. Your mother's asked for you the last two nights. - I've been feeling under the weather. - You know about Ms. Thomas, of course? - Yes. It was terrible. - Your mother was very fond of her. Quite dependent on her too. - It was my impression that she was an excellent nurse. - I hope they find that maniac. Anyhow. We don't like to evade telling the truth to patients. But in coronary cases... We haven't told your mother that Ms. Thomas was murdered. - How have you explained it? - That she's away on a short vacation, went home. It'd be best if you don't say anything either. The shock- - All right. Thank you Doctor. I understand. I'll be very careful. - Where have you been? You haven't been to see me for two nights. - I told you, Mama. The one night I had to work late, and last night I wasn't feeling well. - I don't think you wanna see me. You're always looking for excuses. I don't think you love me. Well, do you? - Stop it. - Leo, I've given you all my love. I've devoted my entire life to you. - You said that 20 times a day. Let's have some music. - It's broken. It won't work. Are you in some kind of a hurry, Leo? - Nope. - Is there some place else you'd rather be? Someone else you'd rather be with? - Who would that be? I don't have any friends. - You found a girl. Is that it? Leo. Leo, I've warned you about women. They're just going to make you unhappy, and ruin your life. - All women except you. Is that what you mean? - Turn around and look at me. Now what would any girl want you for? Come over here, Leo. Come on. Come on. Now, face facts, son. You're not good looking. You're fat. You know very well yourself that some people think you're funny. - Please, Mama. - Even as a little boy, nobody liked you. And except for me, nobody's loved you. And you haven't any money. And women want money. And don't you forget it. Why, you barely make enough of a salary to keep a good looking hussy in stockings. - That I don't, after paying your hospital bills. - Why can't we just talk? Why do you have to argue? Oh, I wish Clara would come back from her vacation. She'd talk to me. I miss her. I miss her so. I can't stop thinking about her, and thinking about her. Didn't you know, Mama? Clara's dead. She's dead, Mama. She was murdered. Claire's dead, Mama. And you'll never see her again. - Oh, Mr. Kroll. How's your mother? - She's fine, thank you. - Good. Good night. - Hello. I'm Leo Kroll. No. She can't be. Mama was well when I left her. Can you call the mortuary? - Nah, I never bought nothing. It sounds like a Mama Doll trademark. - Okay, thanks. - These are called Ruby Dolls. Sophisticated, you know. Nearly like real women, lingerie, cute stuff. - And you've never bought any Mama Dolls for prizes? - No, not in the year I've been working here. - Well, who buys the prizes? - The guy that owns the place. He never comes by except to count the take, something. - Well, that's the way it goes. Thanks. - Well, if it isn't Old Dead Eye. And aren't we dressed up? Do you have a big date tonight or something? - Where's Tally? - It's her night off. We didn't expect you back so soon. Did you run outta dolls? - Just got back into town sooner than expected. Anything wrong with that? - Not if you say so. Lucky in love. Sure been quiet around here tonight. - You've had a customer here just a little while ago. - Guy in the brown suit? Wasn't a customer. It was a cop. Give me some rings. What did he want? - Just asking about some dolls. - You missed. - What did you tell him? - You missed again. - What did he wanna know about dolls? - You missed again. You're really getting lousy tonight, you know? - Give me three more rings. Anyway, what's so important about dolls? - How should I know? You've got all the dolls. You missed again. Do you know you're gonna disappoint all your little nieces? That's what I should have told him. I should have told them to see you. 'Cause you're the big doll expert around here. I bet you could have told him just plenty about dolls. He just wanted to know about some Mama Doll. Mama. Mama, mama. - Why did you say that? - I don't know. What's so important about dolls, anyway? - Just wanted to create a little conversation, that's all. - Hey, are you mad at me? Don't go away mad. Come back. Come here. You're mad 'cause you didn't win anything, huh? - No. - You sure are. Come here. Come over closer. For you. So you won't be disappointed. Give my regards to all your little nieces. - 10, 10th one. We cover all the hospitals and our creep strangles a girl from some Fun Palace. - Well, you can't cover the whole town, Frank. Besides who figured he'd switch? - Because he had a damn good reason. And I wish I knew what it was. - That's why I wanted to see you, Lieutenant. I talked to this Wells girl. - What? - Oh, that's right. He didn't get a chance to put it in his report. Tell him, Mel. - Well, last night about 10 o'clock. That's right, Barbara Wells. She was a relief girl in this Toss a Ring booth at that Fun Palace. I was still trying to check out that Mama Doll. I stopped at this booth, because I saw they offered prizes, dolls. - Dolls? And what'd you find out? - Well, the Wells girl said they never used that kind of a doll for a prize. That's all. She seemed like a good kid. - That's gotta be more than a coincidence. Barbara Wells and Clara Thomas, both with dolls. Even if they were different kinds. Yeah, I'm sure of it. We better plant a stake out there. And at that Toss a Ring booth. - Yes, sir. How many men? - As many as you need. - Right. - Mel, I think we better play this smart. That Strangler can probably smell a plant from a way off. Too many cops around there, he'll never show up. - Let me cover it by myself. - Right. We're not gonna louse this up. You stick out there like it was your Siamese twin. - Gotcha. - Hello. - You, uh... - You don't seem very happy tonight. - Didn't you read about what happened to Barbara? - I just came back from a long trip. - Well, she's dead, murdered. And they think the strangler did it. - Do the police think that? - Yes, they've been here nearly all day. I guess they're gone now. - Do they have any sort of clue? - Only, Barbara. I can't stand to think about her anymore. I can't stand the sight of this booth. I'm leaving the end of this week. - No. You can't go away. I wouldn't see you again. - That's awfully nice of you to say that. But I've got to get away. - Then we'll go away together. I have something for you. See? - Yes, it's very nice. - It's my mother's engagement ring. We'll get married. - No, no. Listen, please. - No, you don't understand. I'm free now. I can do anything I want. I can go anywhere. We can get married. - I don't want to listen to you. - I'll live anywhere you want. I'll take care of you. I earn a good living. I'll go back to medical school. - Please stop. - But I love you. - You can understand that I'm terribly upset. I'm sorry. Really, I am. Can't you see? We can't get married. People just don't get married like that. They have to know each other and they have to be in love. - But I've watched you for a long time, and you didn't even know it. I thought you'd like the ring. I saved it for you after Mama died. - Let's not talk about it any longer. I don't know you. I don't love you. I'm sorry. - You're always smiling. I look forward to seeing you, being around you. I thought you liked me too. -I. - You pretended to love me. - I never did. Look, you were just a customer. That's all. I'm supposed to be nice to everybody. - Oh, she was right. - Who? - I'm funny and I'm fat. And I don't have a lot of money. Is that it? Well, there are a lot of people who don't laugh at me anymore. They don't laugh at anybody. - My new relief girl should show up anytime now. - Do you think I'm going to take no for an answer after all these - ? Well, I don't have to. Not anymore. - Look, please go away. - I'll go. Tally. I'll go away. But I'll see you again. What do you think any girl would want you for? People have to know each other, and be in love. Except for me, nobody has ever loved you. I don't love you. Face facts, son. Face facts. You were just a customer, that's all. I'm supposed to be nice to everybody. I don't love you. Even as a boy, nobody liked you. Please go away. Go away. Go away. Go away. - Hi. Are you still here? - Either that or I'm lost. Mind if I sit down? - No. Thought you'd gone home? - No. I just broke for dinner. Coffee. Any kooks or nuts show up over there? - Well, just before the relief girl got here, this fella comes up to me and right outta the clear sky, he asked me to marry him. He had a ring and everything. - Had you ever seen him before? - He comes here lots of times. He's a customer. But I didn't know his name, or where he lives, or anything about him. - You must have had some idea he liked you. - Not really. When I turned him down, he got real mad. He scared me. - And what did he do then? - He just took the doll he'd won and he left. Must have dozens of those dolls. That's all he ever takes. - You mean this guy likes toy dolls? Look, would you mind looking at a few mug, identification pictures? - No. - Come on. - Here's the last of them, Frank. - That isn't him. I know I'd recognize his picture if it was in here, but I just don't see it. - At least it proves one thing. He doesn't have a record. Or if he does, we don't have it here. Lieutenant, you wanna take a look at this? - Well, it does look a little like him. - But not enough, huh? - Go ahead, Ms. Raymond. Tell him what's wrong. - Well, he should be fatter. His face should be rounder. Yes, that's much better. - How's the age? About right? - Like I told you, pretty close to 30. But the eyes. - Go ahead. Tell him what's wrong. - Well, they're too round, sort of deeper set. - Okay, two round bulgy eyes coming up. Now, are they better? - Yes, much. - Anything else? - I don't know. I think maybe there's something about the chin that's not quite right. - Okay, now you tell me about the chin. Is it large enough? - No, I think maybe too large. - All right, now then I'll take a little bit off. And you tell me when to stop. - Now. No, no. Now it's too pointed. Good. Only he should have sort of a, a double chin. He's big, about 300 pounds. That's it. That looks quite a bit like him now. - It's that fat, egotistical- - Kroll, Leo Kroll. He knew Helen Lawson, Clara Thomas, and Barbara Wells. Pick him up, Mack. - With pleasure. Mel? - Looks like our troubles are over. Coffee? Would you like some breakfast? I'll send out for some. - I'd like to rather go home. - I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait around for a little while. Might have to make an identification. Mr. Kroll ain't been here all night. - Look in there. Mel. - Find anything? - Look in here. - Benson, homicide. All right, Mack. Cover the apartment where he lives, and the hospital where he works, and get on back here. Kroll's not at home. Something must have spooked him. There's a chance that he went back to the Fun Palace, or maybe to your apartment. - He said he would. - Would what? See you again? - Yes. He got sort of wild and said all kinds of crazy things. - When was this? - After he won the doll, as he was leaving. - He won another doll? You gave it to him? - Is that so important? - It might be. I'd say you were probably in considerable danger. I could put out an all points bulletin, cover newspapers, radio, television stations. But that might drive him underground. There's a chance he might leave the state, even the country. But there is a chance we might catch him, if you'll help us. - No. No, I don't wanna get involved. - But you are involved. I can understand if you're frightened. I don't blame you. But we'll give you 24 hour police protection. - No. Please. I told him I was leaving town the end of this week. Well, I've changed my mind. I'm leaving today, now. - All right. I can't make you stay if you don't want to. - I've done all I could. I've identified him. I just wanna go home and get packed, and get out of this town. Then you won't have to worry about me. - But we do worry about you. - Well then don't. I'm sorry. Please, just let me leave. I'll be all right, I promise. I'll get started for Pennsylvania right away. - All right. We'll take Ms. Raymond home. - I know I'm not very brave. And you think he's the strangler, and that he's gonna kill me too. I'm scared, really scared. And when I think of Barbara, I get sick. - Sure. - I can't help it. Plant this radio mic in her apartment. - Will do. You gonna cover her whether she likes it or not. - Yes, but she doesn't have to know about it. - Don't bother to come in with me, Sergeant. - It's no bother. I'll just walk you to your door. - It isn't necessary. - I know. Maybe I like the excuse. You sure you don't want me to hang around for a while? - Really, you don't have to. I just wanna start packing. - Could I have a drink, if it's no bother? - It'll have to be water. - Well, that's fine. Thanks. And have a nice trip. You're welcome, Sergeant. - Something's wrong. - We're not getting any sound. - Probably the mic's cut out. - Why? It was all right a minute ago. - I'm sure the receiver isn't on the bum. It has to be in the mic. - It's the lack of sound that bothers me. Miss Raymond?
