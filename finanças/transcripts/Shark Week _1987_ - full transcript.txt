Esperance is a town in crisis. It's terrifying. There's a lot of stories about these white sharks Being particularly aggressive. The sharks down here are different... Highly inquisitive, very persistent. They don't go away. There's so many questions, and we need these answers. We have to be invisible entering their environment Without them knowing we're there. It's pretty well the deadliest waters you can dive. One shark just went under the cage. I think it might have bit the line. Tell him to come out and abort the dive. Good evening. A man has been killed In a shark attack off esperance. Esperance local gary johnson and his wife Were diving together when he was taken by a great white Only sign of the missing man Were his flippers and a ripped wetsuit. There have been more fatal great white attacks In western australia than anywhere else in the world. The seaside town of esperance has suffered two fatalities In just three years. Locals and scientists are desperate to know What makes these waters so dangerous. The most recent victim, gary johnson, Was diving down to set anchor. A shark came out of nowhere. Local abalone diver marc payne knew gary, And he wants answers. It hits deep what happens with white sharks, Especially when you lose your close friends. These recent attacks. They're not mistaken-identity attacks. They're quite brutal. Gary johnson's story Mirrors marc's own great white encounters. When I'm abalone diving, I see the sharks are out on the outskirts. They're always looking. They're thinking. We work in the pathways of these animals. I probably lost about one in every 15 guys I work with. The sharks down here are different... Highly inquisitive, very persistent. They don't go away. Joining marc to help find out why these sharks Behave differently is scientist dr. Craig o'connell. Craig has studied white shark predation behavior Across the world. It's a really unique situation here. There's been recent attacks. Two of them have been fatal. So what I could say is that these sharks Seem hyper-aggressive. There's so many things we don't know about. There's so much about the behavior, How these sharks use this habitat. Are they different to the sharks In other locations around the world? We've got to get out there, get diving and start learning. Their destination Is pristine wilderness salisbury island, Where craig believes young great whites learn to hunt. I can't believe we're finally here. Holy lord. This place absolutely feels sharky. This is possibly the last great white hotspot Left on the planet that is natural and wild. This is like a jurassic island in the middle of nowhere. Marc thinks the sharks along the esperance coastline Hunt differently to anywhere else in the world, Hiding out in the shadows and networks of caves. Is this unique hunting style Behind the tragic human fatalities? It's amazing such a big fish can be so invisible. They can be very difficult to see. They use the contours and the underwater topography Mainly for the element of surprise. White sharks are masters Of adapting their hunting style to the environment. In south africa, they accelerate upwards with such force That they breach spectacularly. In mexico, they hunt deep down in the water column. But here, craig believes The sharks learn another way to hunt seals. So at this particular time of year, You have these pregnant females, But you also have quite a few inexperienced pups in the area. And they make the perfect appetizer For a great white shark. Yeah, that's blood. I'd say that's a recent kill. Holy cow! I've never seen that before in my life. First, craig wants to confirm reports That the sharks at salisbury island Are mostly young males. Young sharks are more likely to take risks and test boundaries As they learn their predation skills, Which could partly explain the high incidence of attacks. There's only one way to find out. Now, when I first get in, I just kind of want to get a lay of the land. I want to see what it looks like down there. I do have a bunch of technology that I want to test out, But I got to take it one step at a time. Here's a problem. There's a lot of stories about these white sharks Being particularly aggressive, using their stealth Kind of hanging out at the edge of visibility And coming in from all different directions. So my head has to be on a swivel. Craig needs to watch his back down there. The element of surprise is the key here. These parallel lasers right here on the bottom. The idea is we project these on the side of the shark's body When it's exactly perpendicular to the lasers. I could take that image, bring it to my computer, And I can estimate the shark's size. My concern is we're going to be in the cage. The bars are going to get in the way. So there's a possibility we'll have to get out. So if we do that, we know these sharks are super stealthy. So let's watch each other's backs. All right. You ready? Ready. Let's do it. Joining craig and marc, Our cameraman jon shaw And safety diver andre rerekura. Overseeing the dive topside, johnny debnam. Yeah, go ahead for johnny. You know what's actually cool? Jon, come about! Guys, it's pretty... Pretty awesome. About to get in the cage. Shark down on the bottom. So we've got to get in there. Okay. Roger that. That's good to hear. There's no sort of any sharks on the surface here. Hey, craig, are you guys safe out of the cage there? White shark! Next, a scientific breakthrough... Oh, my god! Later... It's coming straight in! The perfect plan turns out not to be one. Let's abort dive! Let's get out! Let's go! - Holy - go! On the south coast of western australia, Great whites cause more fatalities than anywhere else. A man has been killed in a shark attack. Predators in a feeding frenzy. Locals here are calling out for a solution To make these beaches safer. Dr. Craig o'connell and diver marc payne Want to find out why the sharks here behave differently. They believe the sharks learn a unique hunting style Among the gullies and caves of the islands along the coast, A great white lair, salisbury island. They hope to find out how. This is like a jurassic island In the middle of nowhere. By measuring their size with lasers, Craig is attempting to confirm That the sharks here are adolescents, Which might explain why they are so inquisitive. There's no sign of any sharks on the surface here. Hey, craig, are you guys safe out of the cage there? That's awesome. - Good work. - Whoo-hoo-hoo! First dive. Beautiful white shark. - Yes. - Oh, my gosh. I was just face to face with a great white shark. I pick my head up. Its head was right in front of me. The shark was in hunt mode. It was using the contours. They didn't want the divers to see it. So the shark that we saw was about 9 feet, Which tells me it's between a juvenile and subadult. And it was a male. There are young, inquisitive sharks here. But where in the shadows are they learning to hunt? But now we've got to take the next step. Now we want to go survey the area. We want to try and find that perfect spot If we get that perfect environment, That's where we want to go diving To see if we can see that natural predation. Salisbury island is so remote, It's never been fully mapped. Sonar will give a new perspective to help uncover How the sharks use their underwater world. It's ready to go. Cameras are on. Sonar's ready. Live feed's ready. So whenever you're ready, it's game time. Let me know when you get set at the bottom. As the sonar is pulled through the water, A camera also captures a live feed. So I've never got to use a multibeam sonar before. And what's so incredible about it is that I could see All the nooks and crannies of the seafloor. I can get an idea of exactly what it's like down there. - Sea bottom. - Sea bottom, all stop. - Sea bottom. - Stop. Frankly, I'd be happy... - Oh, my god! White shark! - Oh! Holy crap! Directly underneath. What started out as a simple sonar scan To kind of get an idea of what the seafloor looked like Turned into absolute scientific breakthrough. We're watching this live-feed camera system. We're watching the sonar, and then all of a sudden, This really, really small great white shark Comes from out of absolutely nowhere. So what's really exciting about this shark here in particular Is distance from tip to tip was approximately 40 centimeters Or just over a foot, giving us the idea That this animal's total length is about four and a half feet, Which would make this a newborn recently just pupped, Definitely less than a year old, And most likely less than six months old. This could mean the holy grail's nearby, A great white shark nursery. A newborn great white in full hunting mode. It's a world first. We got a predation of a juvenile white shark, Or attempt of a predation. Meanwhile, the sonar reveals clues About how these young sharks are learning. They have extremely rugged terrain, really dark terrain. And these smaller sharks can actually use all these crevices, These pinnacles and these ledges to their advantage. They could use them to navigate. They could use them to escape predation From larger white sharks, and they can use them to hunt. Craig identifies a perfect spot For further exploration, What might be a prime hunting zone. There was one site in particular that I found very interesting, And marc did, too. I saw a lot of fish. We saw seals, sea lions. We saw some caves. That's exactly where we're going to be diving. I think I just saw shark swim by. To observe what's happening in the hunting zone, The team will deploy A 360-degree streaming camera system. What's so beautiful about this camera technology Is it's going to allow us to survey the seafloor And survey this hotspot 24 hours a day. So it's not only going to allow us to potentially see The natural predatory interactions Of great white sharks and seals, but also when activity peaks. All right, marc, so what's the plan here? We've got a 150-pound cement block, And we have this very delicate camera. How do we get this thing in place? Well, we're going to try and deploy this on the seafloor And try to find a nice sandy patch somewhere Where we can not have seaweed and that Going over the lens of the camera. Sure. The camera must be lowered onto a clear sandy bed. But to anchor it down, The divers must do something extremely risky... Leave the cage right inside the hunting zone. What do you think, marc? The moment of truth? - Yeah. - You ready? I'm excited. Strong currents have swept the cage Away from the boat and the target. With the shark gone, They have a short window to get back into position. The cage now in place, topside lower the camera. But the camera also falls short of the target. Next, craig is caught between a rock and a giant shark. Holy Later... A night dive turns nightmare. Tell him to come out and abort the dive. A spate of fatal attacks In esperance, western australia. A man has been killed in a shark attack, Predators in a feeding frenzy. Dr. Craig o'connell and diver marc payne Want to find answers. They're at a nearby great white lair To figure out how these sharks learn a unique hunting style That might be behind the mainland attacks. There's so many things we don't know about. There's so much about the behavior, How these sharks use this habitat. The team have already encountered a rare newborn, So there's more going on here than meets the eye. - White shark! - Oh! To see what's happening in the hunting zone, They must position a 360 camera on a sandy patch of seafloor 20 meters away. But a hyper-inquisitive shark has penned them in. It disappears into the gloom, But they have a short window before air runs out. Marc takes matters into his own hands. Without his fins, marc can walk the camera. But he's a slow-moving target. That was crazy. I'm so out of breath. Yeah, our plan was like, yeah, We're going to nail this. The sand lawn's 20 meters away. So I just rip my fins off. He had a 200-pound camera in his hands. Climbing over the rocks. Steamrolled through these kelp ledges Like I've never seen before. It's like a... Yeah, a bulldog. The information we are going to get from this camera Is so important. We're in a wild location, it's never been touched. We're going to pick up behavior That has never been picked up before. It's not long before the 360 camera Starts providing clues as to how the sharks May be hunting the seals. One of the best ways to understand predators Is also by understanding their prey. This noninvasive camera system is the ultimate way for us To understand how these seals are using the marine ecosystem. We can also understand when these seals Become most vulnerable. From my observations, there's a big change in behavior Between night and day. As the sun goes down, The seals become aware of impending danger. As the light gets lower, What actually winds up happening is you get these massive shadows Adjacent to these ridges, adjacent to these pinnacles. What I actually think is that these white sharks Are using these darker parts of the seafloor To their advantage. They're using Those particular locations to blend in with the seafloor. The prey will never see them coming. And at the last second, They use that vertical approach to feed on them. Craig wants to see how the sharks are using the dark. But diving at night is risky. I've never dropped down in the water column in a cage In the middle of the night to try and study white sharks. In the darkness, it's too difficult and dangerous To maintain the cage's position using buoyancy control. So it must be secured to the boat with a line. Yeah, that's good. Got about 3 minutes. White shark just went under the cage. If the rope snaps, the cage will drop like a stone. Time to come out. Abort the dive. Next, the cage and their lives hang in the balance. Each thread started to pop, pop, pop. Later, one shark won't give up. A run of fatal attacks in western australia. A man has been killed in a shark attack. The only sign of the missing man Was his flippers and a ripped wetsuit. Dr. Craig o'connell and diver marc payne Believe great whites use the darkness of local cave networks As cover for the hunt, Which may help explain the surprise attacks. To test out this theory, The team are diving at night To watch the sharks hunt in the dark. But the dive is going badly wrong. Their lifeline to the surface is breaking. If it snaps, they'll sink fast. Okay. Time to come out. Abort the dive. Let's get as far away from the water as we can. Wow. Now, that was a bit of a heart-pounding moment. Oh Ohh! - Whoa! - Right here. Look at that. It's almost done. Another second, if it was on, it would have popped. It would have dropped it down to the bottom. That's really scary. Everything was coming together. We were understanding when these sharks are hyperactive And we're getting all this information And then it's, "shark! Shark! Shark!" White shark just buzzed right by the cage. This was in full hunting mode. Bubbles going every way. And this animal was hyper-aggressive. The shark bit the line, and then we're in big trouble. The topside crew is actually watching that rope Start to crumble away. - Each thread started to pop, pop, pop. Just like, "no." I just wanted to get out of that. We would have dropped down to the bottom of the seafloor In the middle of the night With a super aggressive white shark. I think we got really damn close. The night dive was a failure. The team need a new approach. And marc has an idea. They'll play the sharks at their own game, Match stealth with stealth. Marc has designed a prototype camouflaged wetsuit. So when we are getting ready on the deck for the stealth dive, I was looking at the guys and their stealth sasquatch suits And was kind of laughing at them. Thought it was kind of weird to be wearing something like that. This has never been done before. We've got these amazing ghillie suits we're going to use. We've got another suit that goes underneath The masks our electrical field, And we're gonna get down there with re-breathers. No bubbles. This is the ultimate way to study great white sharks. Totally noninvasive. Invisible. First, marc and andre will test out the suits. This is gonna be fun. Craig will be an observer. The great whites use all their senses to detect prey. Marc and andre, camouflaged, silent, And with an electrical shield, Hope they won't be spotted. But while marc and andre lie undetected, Craig, without camouflage, is exposed. Guys, that was awesome! It was rad! You guys blended in perfectly with the kelp. I could barely see you. While we were actually down there, I got to see the guys in their environment And they actually became part of it. I could barely see them. But what was most exciting about that entire experiment... A great white would come up to him, And it would just veer off as if they weren't even there. The problem was I wasn't stealthy. I had a wetsuit on. I was blowing bubbles. And that white shark came right up to me multiple times. The stealth suit's a success. Craig can suit up, too. Time to put everything they've learned to the test. This is a bit of an elite club. You're lucky to get in. How do you see through this? So this is it. This is the final experiment. That's what I've been waiting for. The stealth suits work, so we're going to be using that, And I'm actually joining in on the action, But we're using a stingray decoy this time. First the dive team must enter the caves To find the perfect spot, then the topside team Will fly the stingray decoy past the caves. If all goes to plan, They will lure a shark out from the shadows. It will ignore the camouflaged divers And accelerate into the kill while crane records the action. Now, we don't want the sharks to actually attack This stingray decoy, but we want to use it to see If we can elicit some sort of predatory behavior So we can get a little bit more information As to how these sharks use the environment to their advantage. So this is by far one of the most complicated experiments I've ever done in my entire life. There's so many different moving parts That all of it coming together And getting a shark interaction seems almost impossible. So I have this really cool laser device That I'm bringing down with me. It's four equally spaced lasers. They're all parallel. But it's not easy to use. We have to project this on the side of the shark's body. And the idea is we can measure the shark's speed When they're not feeding and measure the shark's speed When it starts to interact with prey. And we can compare the two. There's just one flaw. There's no guarantee the sharks aren't already inside the caves. Lower the cage. Next, the final test... But craig has more than the shark to worry about. Drop her in now. At a remote island hotspot, After a spate of fatal mainland attacks... A man has been killed in a shark attack. Predators in a feeding frenzy. ...Dr. Craig o'connell and diver marc payne Are trying to uncover what makes this population Of great whites predate differently. The sharks down here are different... Highly inquisitive, very persistent. They don't go away. There's a lot of stories about these white sharks Being particularly aggressive. The young sharks here are adept At using their environment to stalk their prey, Hanging out in the shadows of caves and overhangs Before striking. The team want to see this hunting behavior for themselves And help prevent more deaths. This is the ultimate way to study great white sharks. Totally noninvasive, invisible. Wearing custom stealth suits to avoid detection, They enter the island's caves, But nobody knows if the great whites are waiting. At the mouth of the caves, The team are in place to film the action. Topside start to fly the stingray decoy Through the hunting zone. But to entice a shark from the shadows, The tow speed and depth must be just right. Drop her in now. Sting ray is coming by. Have you got a visual there? Okay, roger. No, they didn't get a visual. Okay, turn around and head back. Craig, craig, the stingray cam is on its way. Drop her in. - Yeah! - Yes! Ah, yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo! The mysterious sharks of salisbury island In hunting mode for the first time. Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Holy That was awesome! That was the best time of my entire life. Oh, my god. - Holy I can't believe we did it. Guys, you killed it. Thanks so much. That was the best time of my entire life. It was such a complicated experiment. But everything came together. I projected the lasers and we got our first data point. It was an absolutely incredible moment. So after that initial interaction, They continued to tow that decoy back and forth, And we just kept getting interaction after interaction. And we got to see how these white sharks Use the environment to their advantage. They're keeping an eye on their target, And at the last second, they accelerate. This is the information that we wanted. It was an absolute success. The expedition sheds new light On how western australian great whites Are the ultimate stealth hunters, Using the darkness of the overhangs, Pinnacles and craggy seafloor to close in on their prey. With caves and coves along popular mainland dive spots And beaches near esperance, it may also help explain The unfortunate recent loss of human life. I think the people of western australia Are going to forever look very differently At their white sharks. Interactions with white sharks will not go away. I think is more about just understanding What's happening in those interactions. But craig believes that other human-made factors Are also at play. Fish populations are down. The critically endangered australian sea lion populations Are declining very rapidly. And to me, that could potentially mean That the white sharks are actually moving elsewhere To try and find prey, which could also mean That there could be an increase in this human-predator conflict. What I find very beautiful about the people here Is they didn't retaliate to the point Where they were going out and killing Whatever shark they could get their hands on. I think what's so amazing is they rather Just want to learn more about these animals And they want to find ways that they could coexist And use the shoreline in a much safer way.
