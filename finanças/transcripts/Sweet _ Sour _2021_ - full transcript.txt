There. What's this? I felt bad borrowing my dad's car all the time, so I bought my own. Can you afford it? - Get in first. - But... It's fine. You haven't had a ring since you lost your graduation ring. So I got it for you. It's so pretty. Thank you. You don't have to worry anymore. I have a car now, so I'll come back and forth every day. Don't worry, okay? It's a clear Monday, but commuting to work is still a chore. There's quite a lot of traffic on Gyeongin Expressway - towards Seoul. - Damn traffic... - Sinwol IC to Seoul and Yeouido - Damn it. is also jammed up with traffic. It will take a couple of hours...

What the... Gosh... - What the hell? - What? There's one more person here. Really? Large corporations sure are different. They're not easy. What the heck is this? Just take it easy then. Your job's still here. I bought a car and even rented a place in Seoul. - I can't go back. - Gosh. Then you'll have to do well if you want to stay there. Damn it. What about Chinese today? Yes. I think rice will be good. I don't crave any Korean food today. What the... She's always scowling. Don't be like that. You just have to do a better job. You're colleagues, so be nice. Congrats on your first day of work. Cheers. You can just get closer to people and make them appreciate your worth. One, two, three, four... What the... Do you need help? No. I'm fine. - Have some coffee. - Bo-yeong. - It's Americano. - Appreciate it. - Thank you. - Enjoy. - Thanks. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Thanks. Sir. Here's some coffee. Thank you, Bo-yeong. What are youâ€” Hey. Shouldn't you tell them that I bought them? What? I was just helping. I guess you want to brag that you bought coffee. I'm sorry. I should just let you spill the coffee next time. What's this? They said the bridge was urgent, not the substructure. Didn't you hear during the meeting? I know. I was just checking it out. You should thank me. You almost got in trouble. That was close. Jang-hyeok. Don't you see everyone else sketching the substructure? You're the only one working on the bridge. Pay attention to what I say. Hey. Hey. What are youâ€” It's a woman? That crazy person? If it were a guy, I would've... She sounds like she's no joke. It must be so hard for you. You know I hate sweets. Yes. You absolutely hate it in case you gain weight. She shoved a candy in my mouth. A mint candy of all things. She did? She must be crazy. What's her problem? - She's crazy. - She really is a weirdo. We got this patient today, andâ€” I'm so pissed off. I don't know what to do. Shouldn't we book now if we want to go to Jeju for Christmas? You take care of it. Come here. In a minute. Come here. Let me think. Give me one minute. How do I get back at her? Nice. Who came up with this creative idea? Bo-yeong. She just got here. Thank you. Excuse me. There's a problem with that structure. What? That is a flood zone. There's a risk of the bridge collapsing. I believe the bridge design should be completely reexamined. WARNING So... This isn't the final version, so we'll restructure it and revise the design a little... What's the English word for that? Yes, we'll "crystal" it before the deadline. - It should be fine. - Okay. Why don't the two new employees work on this? We can see what your abilities are like. - You are excellent andâ€” - Shall we go? Shall we... Give us some time and we'll do it again and make it perfect. This will collapse. Good luck. That little... No. It's too weak. What is this? Damn it. Is this that hard? What? Let's get moving. I need to go home. She's so gross. I'M DONE NOW. WHEN ARE YOU DONE? I'LL HEAD OUT NOW I'm going home. You can finish it by morning, right? - Why are you staring at me? - I'm not looking at you. You must be cross-eyed. Good bye. - Are you going to leave her like that? - Pardon? - On purpose? - What... Good. What the hell? Move, will you? Da-eun! Jung Da-eun! - I totally got revenge. - Hey. Wash up. - In a minute. - No. Wash up. - In a minute. - Please? In a bit. Da-eun. Sorry. I must've been too exhausted last night. Isn't it too hard to commute from Incheon? If you get off work too late, we can meet this weekend. I might have a day off. You don't need to come every day. Really? Yes, it's fine. Okay, then. I'll see you this weekend. - Okay. - Okay. What the... How frightening. Okay. Hold on. What is that foul smell? Don't eat in the conference room. No eating. She's a tough one. I'm so tired. She's so gross. We're still in here! Why are they turning off the lights? Turn onâ€” Hey, Mr. Jang. I was just trying to lend you a helping hand. What? You have to seize the opportunity when it presents itself. Only an amateur thinks too much and misses out. Just turn on the light. Be a pro. Seriously. Seriously. She's so gross. Excuse me. Either eat or work. Just do one at a time. I'm eating to stay awake, you prick! Do you know how badly I want to go home? Being dirty doesn't matter. It's this bridge that matters. This design! Look how pretty this is. I swear I'll make this work and leave it looking pretty. You're the reason I can't go home. Who cares if I'm dirty? Just do this. I'M OFF TOMORROW. YOU CAN COME, RIGHT? YOU MUST BE BUSY You need good talent to refresh the company. Our team members should hurry and catch up. Regardless, we got a good result, - so take the team out. - Thank you. Thank you, boss.

But we're moving slower than I expected. There's a lot we need to do, so we need to have meetings. If you keep this up, we can't do our job well. We have to be together... What are you looking at? What? Nothing. Are you listening? Yes. If we mess up, we'll get yelled at. Then we may get fired. That's not good. We should keep working, right? Okay. I'll work a little more. I won't leave. I JUST FINISHED I CAN'T GO. I HAVE TO WORK LATE INCHEON CITY HOSPITAL OKAY. DON'T WORK TOO LATE. SEE YOU TOMORROW We need at least two more. Two? It's good. - Cheers. - Cheers. SORRY, I HAVE TO WORK LATE AGAIN ME TOO. COME ON SATURDAY INSTEAD How about a dermatologist. A dermatologist? I was really good. Nice. - We did well. - We're done. It was me who came up with the idea. YOU'RE COMING TOMORROW, RIGHT? SURE. LET'S GO SOMEWHERE NICE I'm going. Seriously. Hey. It was impossible to find parking. What do you think? They're pretty. Which one looks better on me? This one. This one? Isn't this prettier? Just get that. Why are there so many people? Damn it. I'm hungry. Let's go. - You're not getting it? - No. I'm so tired. There's so much work that I didn't even get to finish it. Try some of our macarons. You can just try them. That one is strawberry. I don't want it. I don't like sweets. This is green tea, and this is blueberry. We made them today. They're really good. I'll come back another time. Let's go if you got what you needed. I'm tired. I don't need anything. Let's go. Just buy them online. There's a lot of good stuff online. Let's eat quickly and rest. I'm exhausted. Is it exhausting seeing me? Don't be like that. Why are you crying? Seeing you isn't exhausting. I'm just really busy at work. You know... I'm very busy at work too, and I'm also exhausted. But I want to be with you, and I want our time together to be special. And I came because I wanted us to love each other more. Do you think I came here to buy something? Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I really am. Let's go. I'll take you to an amazing restaurant. - Chin up. - What's wrong with you? Why do you always want to eat? Is it because you're hungry or are you trying to kill time? You don't want to do anything with me anymore, do you? How could you say that? Don't be mad. I'm sorry. Okay? Don't cry, my pretty Bo-yeong. Okay? You can't park here. Please move your car. Okay, I will. Why are you crying? Should we put on some music? Ms. Ah, who brutally stabbed her boyfriend to death for cheating on her, was arrested by the police. The police announced that the man cheated on her with his work colleague... What should we eat? Pull over. What? I said to pull over. We can go there. Would you like to order? A couple set please. What are you doing? What? Sorry. You get the most expensive one. A gold burger set too. Please, drive through. Let's go. - It's 27,000 won. - Who is it? Who? She's a cashier. It'll be right out. Thank you. Who's Bo-yeong? Who? A colleague at work. You're mad because of that mistake I made. She's a colleague. Do you call your colleague "my pretty Bo-yeong"? Are you suspecting me? There's nothing going on with her. What's wrong? Are you saying I cheated on you? I never said that. Your face says you suspect me. Excuse me. Your food's ready. You said her name so tenderly. What are you talking about? Be reasonable! How is this unreasonable? You're the one being unreasonable. Why do you keep suspecting me? Do you think I slept with her or something? Why are you doing this to me? I'm tired, but I came anyway. Didn't you come because you missed me? You don't come because you miss me anymore. I'm forcing you to come, aren't I? I came because I wanted to see you. I felt bad for you, so... You feel bad for me? I... feel so bad for our baby that you gave up on. What? Hey. Was that only my fault? Fuck. Seriously. Fuck. Seriously. How dare she suspect me? Did I do it with her? Did I? Shit. Are things tough? If it's tough, it's love. - Unbelievable. - What are you talking about? They went to eat without us again. Don't have burgers. Have rice. Hyeok! What should we have for lunch? Let's eat something better than what they're eating. You've been so focused lately. Did something happen? - It's pretty. - I know, right? But it would look better in this color. What time is it? Why are you up so early? Go back to sleep. - This place is really good. - Yes. I feel warm inside. What should we get? - How about galbitang? - Sounds good. - What are you looking at? - What? Nothing. Let's eat. Let's eat. Oh my gosh. He's so cute. Isn't he so cute? Yes, he's cute. I want a baby soon. Hello? You rarely call now. Are you looking down on our mid-sized firm because you're at a large corporation? Stop that. I'm working my ass off with all-nighters. Really? Anyway, your contract is almost over. Did they say anything? I'm working hard, but they haven't said anything. You should get established there and take me with you. Okay? Hello? Hey. A REMINDER THAT YOU HAVE RESERVED TICKETS TO JEJU Hey. Hello? Are you there? Yes. I didn't hear you. Now that you're at a large corporation, you're kicking me to the curb. Don't be like that. Karma will get you. How about braised kimchi with Jeju black pork today? You always make the best choices. There's also a new Jeju black pork noodle place. - How does that sound? - Nothing beats having it in Jeju. Black pork braised kimchi. Let's go.

You don't mind if I call you "Hyeok," do you? I'm tired because there was so much freaking traffic coming here. I haven't gotten my period. It's been four weeks. Since it's the first trimester, you may have bad morning sickness. You may suddenly get very hungry and feel like having this and that. There's no freaking way I have a girlfriend. I can't stand people who talk like that. Even if you're sleepy and tired, you can't have coffee, alcohol, or smoke. Jaundice! You may get very sleepy. The baby is saying, "Mommy, I'm sleepy."
