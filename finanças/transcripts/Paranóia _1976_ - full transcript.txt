Sao Paulo. December, 1975. Get in, scoundrel! I don't want to gossip... but Pimenta is up there, with two tramps. Oh, really? Do you have a light? You're gonna end up dead this way, faggot. I need to talk to you. Make them leave. Bitches leave. A two year period? This isn't correct. Call the Legal Department. Hello? Right away, madam. Hello Silvia. Is she already there? Marcelo, I need to talk to you. I'm not feeling well again. I had a horrible nightmare. I told you to stop playing that music! I'm sorry. I'm just very nervous. I know. Now, could you listen to your music a little bit more quietly? Alright. Did you go to school today? I went, but I didn't have class. Get my clothes from the laundry. At what time should I serve dinner? Same as always, unless Marcelo is late. Bruno didn't come for lunch. That rascal... Try to find out where he is. I'm running late. Silvia went to the doctor again. I know, she told me. It's an analyst. Analyst? It's a head doctor, for people that aren't well up there. Yeah, she's definitely not well up there. That's why she's getting treatment. And what's that treatment like? I don't know. All I know is that she lays down on a sofa and starts talking about all her problems. And what does the analyst say? Nothing. She told me he hasn't said anything yet. Nothing at all? But... does that solve anything? I don't know, but at least she can vent. Marcelo has been trying to get rid of me for a long time. He doesn't love me anymore. I feel used. Left aside. He doesn't have the right to do that to me. I sometimes feel like trashing the whole house. Sometimes I think he wants to kill me. Miss Silvia is crying. She cried the entire time during dinner. She didn't eat nearly anything. And Dr. Marcelo? Everybody pretended they didn't see her. I felt so sorry for her. She spends a lot of time with that doctor. I think she is... Poor thing. I don't know if I should go and clear the table nowâ€¦ She might blow up at any moment. Dad, she's not well. That's why you have to be patient with her. -Where are you going? -To my room, to listen to some music. Do you want me to stay with her? Yes, child. She's asleep. I'm going upstairs. I'll go see how she's doing. I'm going to watch some TV. If you need anything, just let me know. I'll get it. Hello? Hello? Hello! What movie is this? A war film. Boring. Do you wanna see it? Yes. -And mom? -She's sleeping. Well, I'm going to sleep as well. I have to get up early in the morning. Could you give me a ride tomorrow? Yes, child. -Bye. -Bye. He's waking up. Good evening, Dr. Marcelo. Give me your hand. Get up. You're still a bit fucked up, aren't you? Take it easy, doctor. You might hurt yourself. This is just routine. I just need to know if you're armed. Put your hands up, come on. Very well, doctor. That's how I like it. He's not armed. What's the problem here? I have no problem. That's the problem here, that I don't have any problems. How many phones do you have in the house? You have one here, one in the library... ...one in the kitchen, one in the bedroom... Alright, alright. We better cut the wire outside. Go, Pimenta. Can you deal with this on your own? Yes, go. Manoel! Open the door! Open the door! Hey, girl. Take it easy. We're not gonna eat you. -Pimenta! -Yes, boss? Wake up the others. The boy first. Which one is his room, doctor? The first one. What are you waiting for? I always have to do the shitty work. Please, leave my wife out of this. She's ill. She's very stressed. She took some pills, she probably won't wake up. Well, it will depend on your cooperation. There's eight thousand here. I want a million. I don't have a million! How come? A man of your position? My wife might have two thousand more. The employees... the children.. Scraping everything, you might gather three K more. three thousand plus eight... eleven thousand? All this work for that little? Calm down! What about your bank accounts? I don't have that much. Maybe I could gather up to 200 or 250 thousand cruzeiros. I can leave the lady alone and avoid much unpleasantness... but you're gonna have to collaborate, Dr. Marcelo. Yes, naturally. How much do you really have in the bank? I guess I could gather 900 thousand Wake up! Don't say a word or I'll put a bullet in your mouth. And take that shit off your ears. Stop it, Capenga. You're gonna make one of them throw a fit. If somebody throws a fit, he dies. Is anybody gonna throw a fit? Look what I got you, Naval! Don't touch my son! Stop it! Someone else wants to play brave? Pimenta, go get the girl. She's gone. Shit! Capenga, help him to find her. Take it easy, doctor. Next time there's gonna be a bullet for you. Leave her alone. Joao's orders. Alright. Go with God. The girl vanished. She's not here. Or, she heard everything and hid. Or maybe your daughter sneaks out of the house at night. I can't believe it. She went to bed two hours ago. What are you doing there? Check everything up again. Look outside. She's got to be somewhere. A watchman is coming. He saw the car outside. Get everybody into the kitchen. I'll stay here with Dr. Marcelo. Whoever tries anything, gets a bullet. Understood? Now we're gonna open the door, Dr. Marcelo. Come in. Good evening, Dr. Marcelo. Excuse me, but there's a car parked in front of the gate... Don't worry about it. I just had a little accident and this gentleman offered me a ride home. Did you get hurt, doctor? No, no. Just a little cut here. -Do you need anything? -No, everything's alright. -Good night then. -Good night. You were perfect, Dr. Marcelo. Get your hands off my daughter, you pig! -Stay put! -She was in her mother's room. She tried to alert the watchman, but Pimenta... Can anybody give me a hand? Sure thing, brother. Dad, they killed the watchman! You promised... Listen, girl. You already caused the death of a watchman. Now try not to cause the death of your dad, your mom, your entire family. Understood? And you better listen, Dr. Marcelo. We're gonna stay here until the banks open up. I'm a professional, but some of them aren't. I don't want to be responsible for a massacre. You understand me? Now we'll see the best way to get through the night. Shut your fucking mouth! He bled like a pig. Take it out of here. Wait. It's too heavy. Where can I put this package? In the laundry. You're gonna help us out. Come on. Come on! Do you wanna get some too? Grab it over there. You clean that up. Everything's fine now. It was stupid to leave the car outside. I told you to put it away. Yeah, my bad. How about a drink? Good idea! We earned it. I want some whisky. Which one's the best you have, doctor? The most expensive? They're all expensive. But which one's your favorite, doctor? The one in the small bottle. Gentlemen, there are glasses down there. Fancy whisky, huh? Very fancy, brother! I knew I'll end up drinking the best stuff. -Do you want some? -No! Do you want a drink, Naval? No, I don't. Naval doesn't like to drink. Ain't that right, Naval? He goes crazy. And that's when he gets dangerous, right? I accepted to cooperate, but don't make a racket. Do you want to wake up my wife? That's our problem. Marcelo. Who are they? What are you doing here? You came to get me! I don't wanna go! Calm down, honey. It's a robbery. A robbery... Silvia, come with me. You better talk to your people, Dr. Marcelo. Tell them it's important for them to cooperate. That way things will be easier for you and for me. Take the staff to the kitchen. Meanwhile, the doctor will have a talk with his family. Ain't that right, Dr. Marcelo? We're gonna have some dinner, Dr. Marcelo. Naval, keep an eye on them. I'll send someone to take your place later. Come here, Bruno. Pay attention: I don't know if we'll be able to speak freely again, it might be our last chance. They're murderers, they'll do anything. -Murderers? -Yes, mom. They killed the watchman. They beat up dad and Manoel. Why don't they just take the money and leave? Because they want too much money, and the banks won't open until the morning. It means they're gonna spend the night here. Now pay attention: don't try anything. They're just a bunch of morons, the important thing is that we get out of this alive, got it? Yes, dad. Try to stay calm. Terrible things will happen. What kind of terrible things? They're drinking, and this kind of people get violent when they're drunk. Anything could happen. You mean Lucia and I could get raped? Yes. Me, you, the staff, the children... We could all be victims of all kinds of violence. This is crazy! Tasty! Dad. Do you have a smoke? Sure. Help!... Help! Stop it!... Stop it! You could've waited a little longer. Capenga didn't want to wait. He really liked her. Take a look outside. Somebody could've heard something. Alright, boss. Help me! Murderer... Murderer! Keep your hands off my wife, you piece of shit! Take her upstairs and pump her full of medicine. Come. Come on, don't be like that. That's just life. There's always a first time. Or are you gonna tell me you didn't like it? Come. You'll be next. Take this. I don't want to sleep. Drink it. You need to sleep. Think about the children. I'm always a burden, am I? When you wake up, the nightmare will be over and everything will be just like before. Like before... How was it before? Don't you love me anymore? I love you... very much. That's a lie. Why don't you sleep with me anymore? It's not the right time to talk about this! It is! We could all be dead tomorrow. I'm like this because of you. I can't even talk to you anymore. You're dead, Marcelo. You died a long time ago and you didn't even realize. A living dead. You've been dead for a long time and nobody noticed. A long... long time... Capenga, look what I've found. So what? Are you good at this? I think so. Then listen to me... -Is she asleep? -Yes. Perfect. Now go to the kitchen to check on the staff and you can get something to eat. Hey, doctor. Want to play cards? I don't really feel like it. You're gonna play. Right Pimenta? You don't want to let us down. Right, doctor? Right. -We still need one more. -I'll play with you, dad. Now you're talking. Two teams: bandits against good guys, right? Stay calm. Look in there. Shit! He just came in. I didn't know who he was. I didn't mean to kill him. I didn't mean to. Drink this. Drink that shit! Could anybody have heard anything? I don't think so. This place is deserted. Go and check outside to be sure. Go inside. Go inside now! He's dead, so what? It's over now. I demand to know what happened. -You demand it? -Yes. Naval killed the paper boy. -Why did he do that? -It was an accident. -An accident? -It wasn't or purpose. I didn't know who it was. Murderers... criminals! That's right, and that's why you better not fool around. It's almost time. You better go upstairs and get ready. You don't look good. I'm gonna go to the two banks to get the money. The doctor comes with me. If we're not back by eleven... you know what to do. Let's go, doctor. Bye. -Let's go! -Wait! Don't hurt my children. Everything's going to go OK. Let's go. Everything's going fine so far, Dr. Marcelo. Now we only need to get the money. I'm worried about my wife. Why? Isn't she sleeping? No. She's in shock! I won't kill you now, you son of a bitch... because I want to save my family! But if anything happens to them, guess what will happen to you! I don't need to guess anything, it's all very clear, Dr. Marcelo. -Yes, very clear. -Let's go the bank, then! You're nothing but a bunch of shitty scoundrels! I had this gun in the drawer the whole time and you didn't even find it. Enough talk. Let's get the money. I'm gonna go to the employee's room. Ok, have fun. All this, doctor? Yes, and fast. I'm in a hurry. I'm sorry but you're gonna have to speak with the manager. Please, call the manager! Good morning. Excuse me, Dr. Marcelo. It's just routine. You're pretty much closing your account. Can you confirm your signature? -Goodbye. -Have a nice day. No! I don't want to! Please! Help me! It's almost eleven and Joao hasn't returned. Something must've happened. We better do what we planned. I'm gonna go upstairs with the girl. You take care of the boy. Alright. Don't use the gun. Help me, Naval! The manager found your story very strange. When you left, he called your home but it was out of service. It was very suspicious. And he saw the check from the other bank. When you arrived, we were waiting for you. The thief was an old acquaintance of ours. The kid was murdered. Your wife... Silvia! Oh, my god!
