Ev'rytime I go to town The boys start kickin' my dawg aroun' Makes no dif'rence if he is a houn' Better stop kickin' my dawg aroun' Komboo! You're good doggy you. - Hey, do I know you? < Yeah, Harry, I'm John Landis. - John Lan.. ooh.. Where do I know you're from? - When I was 18 years old, I went behind the Iron Curtain to the former Yugoslavia to work as a gofer on a movie called Kelly's Heroes for MGM. This is a film about Don Rickles who I met in 1969. - Man was a pain in the ass runner, kept running up to my trailer, Mr Rickles, they're ready for you. Not now your little peggy ass. go back to them you little son of a bitch. - Let's go! - You see, we're just a private enterprise operation. - Those freaks! That ain't an army, it's a circus! - It could be the perfect crime. - And me. So I figured I'd start with Clint Eastwood. - I've seen probably his acts as more than most people, more than I'd like to remember. - That's nice. What's in it for me? - Did you see the action? - What kind of action? - This kind of action? - He used to always say in his act, he'd say that, he says, what do I look like? Larry Dickman from Des Moines or something like that? And I always thought Larry Dickman, that's a hell of a name. And I've registered in hundreds of hotels across the country as Larry Dickman ever since then. - Since Kelly's Heroes get all it's done for me? How about nothing? That's how good an actor I am. How about nothing? The man raves, they all do that. De Niro, same thing. - Don Rickles is a good actor. - I'm sitting there with a cardboard box on Hollywood boulevard with my wife. - My name is Larry Dickman. - Well he... is a.. a great comedian and very funny. His delivery is uh was always you know great. And and and I like that kind of humor. - When you were alone with what he's like De Niro, I don't light up a room. - This is about Don Rickles? I'm out of here. - I know that the casino is very happy. When Don Rickles here they got more gaming. People, you know, I wouldn't say high class. High rollers. - Beautiful. - Just yourself? - No, my husband's getting us a drink. - Okay, A12, enjoy the show. - Thank you comrade. - Good evening, how are you? Thanks for coming. - You're gonna be on a 284 suite close to an elevator. You'll be dressed, you'll have the tuxedo wearing. - I've meant to tell you, if I got to put my hands in.. - We'll see, we'll figure that out. We know we know that that's an issue. We're gonna figure out how to do it. - I'm the cigarette girl here at the Star Dust. Anyone that needs cigarettes or cigars, I take care of that. But I also sell lighted souvenirs for adults, kids all different ages. The Dodgers went tonight, they'll be in good shape. < That'll put them what uh 2. 5 up? - Yeah. < 2. 5. - I go in the showroom, the restaurants everywhere except for the fine dining restaurant. I go around all the tables, the whole casino floor basically. - G3. B42. > B42. There isn't an ocean too deep A mountain so high it can keep, keep me away Away from my love And where he goes I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow I know I'll always love him, I love him, I love him And where he goes I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow I know I'll always love him, I love him, I love him And where he goes I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow I know I'll always love him Good night. - And now here he is, Mr Warmth himself, Don Rickles! - It's wrong! God damn it.. Stop the goddamn dance! What the hell is the matter with you for Christ's sake? It's a mexican thing, it's important for crying out loud. You go ta-da-da-da, I walk out and do the circle. They play the music. They're playing it wrong and not a whole goddamn kitchen is gonna quit. Am I right or wrong? I don't want the colored guy to bud in. - My name is Joe Mealy. And for the past 20 years I've been working for Don Rickles. I am his conductor, his arranger and his pianist. - Did you pass away? Am I talking to a wall here? These are nice people. Look at the front! We're gonna stay home for Christ's sake. Look at it! Look at this old guy, spitting up all over himself for Christ's sake. I hate that! I hate you got old, go home and die! I'll tell you this! My luck, this guy will pass away. Ah, you ruined the whole goddamn show! No, I want to do a good job for Christ's sake! I really do. What are you doing smelling your hand? I'll tell you this now. Guy sitting here got, Jeez, I stink! I'll tell you this! It's the whole God... Get your head out of the seat, it's not a boat trip! I'll tell you this! Try to do a goddamn job, there's no.. You people in the back got screwed with those cheap seats. I tell you this! That's the main thing, I try to do a job. I swear to God, that's the whole goddamn thing to understand what people... We have the china man get in here. I'll tell you this! 40 million Jews, they got a chink sitting right the goddamn front! Jesus christ! Get out of the way goddammit! That's the whole damn thing... What's your name? - Get up! Now, get your ass out of here, I don't want you in here. I want to be with you so badly lady. I'm much older than you, but spider's alive. You're queer? - No! - Okay, go sit down. - All right. - What are you, Irish, Italian? - Italian-Irish. - Italian-Irish? Oh, your father was a sailor? I'll tell you this! Get the hell out of the way for christ's sake! Trying to do a show and I got a big ass sticking out there in the front! That's the whole goddamn thing. I spoke to the home, you're going back. I'll tell you this! You're all ladies sitting there wheezing like it's normal for... Chinese, Filipino, Japanese! Three years in a jungle looking for your father! Japanese! Three years, I had a lot of that crap! - You know, some guys just have that thing. It's like, you know, being funny is like being a pretty girl, you just get away with a lot of shit. You know, it's like, he's got big tits like, you know. It's like he can do no wrong. - You're Italian? What is your heritage? German? Get a rope! I'll tell you this! What's your name, Fritz, Hans? What? Frank my ass! Frank! Never met one in World War II, my name is Frank. Does this relax you Frank? You wanna put on your helmet, don't you? Is he smiling or go up for the rifle? 40 million Jews, I got a Nazi sitting on a goddamn front! - Started playing with Don, at the Golden Nugget. So it's been about 20 years now. - Is that your wife? Jesus Christ! I'll tell you this! No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. That's a joke. I swear you're a pretty woman. I'll tell you this! - I grew up in New Hampshire, so other than like me, I'm a jew, there weren't many other, like there were no minorities or anything. So listening to Don Rickles albums and stuff really taught me about what other people were like, you know. And then when I did meet a black person or a japanese person, I was able to know what to expect. - That's what I do, I laugh about people. No matter what the hell you're Irish, Jewish, Italian, Negro, Puerto Rican.. Well, Puerto Rican.. Puerto Rican said to me in New York in an alley. I went, Son of a bitch, I don't even know Maria! Anyway, hey, this is what you're going to hear lady! If you're waiting for Billy Graham to come in and make your kid walk again, forget about it! - Ginny said to me, he's the sweetest man I think I've ever met. And she said he's just, he's such a family man. And you know, it kills him to be on the road. And I said, Well honey, his act is going to be a little different than the person you just met. So we go in and Don comes out. First thing he says, he said, The stammering idiot is here from Chicago with his hooker wife from Bayonne, New Jersey. So, and with that my wife's face fell. That's him. - The funniest thing for me is watching people respond because they sort of act like they're a little bit indignant, but you know, they're so glad that he picked them that it's just you know, harrumph, harrumph.. Oh my God Don Rickles picked me out! - Black people can do black jokes, Jews, do jew jokes, Italians do italian jokes, etcetera etcetera... He does them all and gets away with it because he's hysterical. - Everybody wants to get shit on by Don Rickles. - Don has never lost his disdain for sensitivity. - Clint, I say it, nobody else has said it and I say it from my heart. You're a lousy actor. - I guess it's from the great tradition of the fool and the gesture of the, you know being there to kind of level the king and keep it real. - Good evening, Mr President. Nice to see you sir and your lovely wife Nancy. It's a big treat for me to fly all the way from California to be here for this kind of money. Secretary of State's here and Billy Graham, nice to see you, sir. This hand is bothering me. Anyway, is this too fast running? Anyway, he's sitting there looking at the program going, Where does he say, he makes fun of me? Where does it say that? - Really good ones could insult the king and then back over, I'm just adjusting. You know, I'm just kidding. What are you talking about? But your wife without the hump is a very attractive woman. - He just can't help but tell the truth, that's where he's at. That's why one of the reasons I put him right up there in his own way with Lenny Bruce and Pryor because he's fearlessly honest. - I'm married 41 years with jewish broke. Don't applaud, you never saw her. Anyway, 41 years, just let somebody go, is that about it? Anyway, I make it exciting though. Last night I was a barge going up the Mississippi. Barge coming up the Mississippi! Boom! Boom! Boom! And she's the dock. Boom! And she lays there, Hit the dock, hit the dock! Boom! Then I get a black brother to stand on my shoulders going, Ol' Man River. Boom! Then I got another one. I tell her I'm a beaver. I put my ass on top of the bed and I go... And she lays there going, Find the dam, find the dam! Oh the other one, the other one! I tell her I'm Geronimo, see, like a wagon train. I tied her to the couch and tell her she's a wagon train going west. And I circle couch and an indian attack me going, She lays, going, Attack Geronimo, attack! I did that last night for about an hour. Then I got fed up and put an arrow in her. She's still up in her room going, Finish me off Geronimo, finish me off! You're a nice crowd, God bless you, nice people. I mean that sincerely, nice people. This lovely lady, are you chinese here? If you're not chinese, you better get your eyes fixed, okay? - He did not say that. He did not, but he was going in for the kill and he did, he killed. - I can't believe he's saying that kind of stuff, you know that's not right, but it was so hilarious, you know, it's like a guilty pleasure, kind of like, you know, tongue kissing a third cousin or something. - It gets funnier when he picks people out of the audience, of course. The minute he turns to the guy in the front row it's over. - Where's the guy that's Italian? You're italian? What is your heritage, my friend? - English. - English? Well how did you get those seats? We need your people for the muffins. I'll tell you this! Are you married? I love you guys when you make like, I want to take a pop at it, Mary. Got to be like the Jews circle the bed and get an estimate. - He's really wonderful to watch because he ties everybody together. He's the plate spinner comic as he keeps working everybody off everything. He's just vince he's just.. what was that the movie with.. The Last Angry Man? Yeah, he's like that and he's very much like that except he's just hilarious. - I moved to the West Coast, I was pursuing my own career and one of my first jobs was at Channel 13 in Hollywood, went down to San Diego to do the news. - You're lovely couple, are you married here? Are you a mute? Get Jerry Lewis on the phone, I found a mute! - So after the show I said you know my name is Regis and I'm starting out in television, I'd love to interview with you. Could we do it outside on the corner? So we went out to the downtown San Diego right there on the, on the sidewalk, and we did an interview and of course he beat me up and I loved him even more. - Where's the japanese guy? Where are you? Where is the japanese guy? Raise your hand the japanese guy. Where are you? What's your name my friend? < Joe. - Joe? - I remember you guys when the truck stop. Hey Joe, wanna meet my sister? What's your last name, Joe? What? Joe Tan? Don't need to get pissed off, Joe. Just asking your name. - My name's Tony 'O' Opedisano, although, most people call me Tonio. And I've been Don's road manager for about 14 years. And before that I was with Frank for a good 10 years. It was about four year overlap when I was doing double duty with both of them. - Who is your favorite male singer? - Honest? - Yeah. - Dick Haymes. - Dick Haymes, I've never, I've heard you with at the Paramount. You always annoyed me! - As a road manager for Don? I'm in charge of sound and light design. Watch. And now here he is Mr Warmth himself, Don Rickles. - I'm with him pretty much until he goes to bed. Same thing I did with Sinatra. Although the hours with Don are a lot shorter. With Frank, we rarely went to bed before six or 7 in the morning. Yeah. < Dead. Dead. Cancer. Dead. Hanging on the ropes. Very bad, very sick. Almost dead and dying. - Don has a little boy in him and he's a rascal of a little boy. And he is a busy body little boy and he gets into your life, and he walks the edge and you know what that edge is. Everybody who's ever seen Don work, they know what that edge is. And they as a matter of fact, they come looking for it, but that's who he is and that little boy still exists in the man. I see it every time I see him. And if I have a convers... If I have a conversation with Don for a minute, there's never been a time when that little boy didn't show up. - We're gonna be Japanese soldiers. I'm gonna be a general Paca Saima. You're gonna be colonel, Yuho Duina. And you're gonna be corporal I'm about to give it harry carry. - Okay. - You say, Do not die, great general, do not die. - Do not die. - The japanese people are strong. We must never let the island be taken. We will fight to the last man. There are people who know we are strong and we are brave. Banzai, banzai! But if they attack we will attack them and we will never die. Banzai, banzai! And you James say, Right. Come on. Now we bend our knees and we still got teeth like japanese. Look at the sky, japanese style. - It's a very dangerous thing to talk about why things are funny. It's a bad business to be in because then you start dissecting things and you start getting strange. It's it's bad. It's such a visceral response. - I first saw Don Rickles live in the 70s at the Latin Casino. And at that time I was punk. And Don came out and did that show, holding the mic and dropping it and that intensity. And he had this quality of... pleasing the audience was the most important thing in the world, not in his life in the world, but he would not compromise in any way to please them. A very complicated, very important idea. In a certain sense, the definition of art. - Don Rickles my dream guy. And I'll see him soon, live at the Latin Casino. I think I'd better call in my reservation now. Enjoy Mr Warmth, Don Rickles, plus Fabian and dinner live at the Latin Casino. Call now for reservations. - After I'd seen Don, it turned out that the people that were my heroes were like the Velvet Underground, Iggy Pop and the Stooges, you know, Bob Dylan, Houdini, Don Rickles. Give a nice say and a nice guy, is that? The computer guy, let's score. - I mean when I was growing up, Rickles was probably on every show, I remember watching, all my favorite shows as a kid. He was on Munsters, he was on F Troop, Gillian's Island, Dick van Dyke, Get Smart, I spy, remember the Twilight Zone? Adam's Family? He was at Bewitched, Gomer Pyle. Oh and I remember a great thing with Don, on The Andy Griffith Show. Have you ever shown [Inaudible]? At least in my little world in the 1960s. - How much you weigh, Chinee? How much you weigh? - I have this affinity for Don Rickles. It's the same kind of thing that if you can't laugh at yourself, just make fun of other people. - That's your husband? You must lay in bed and go, NO! Goddamn it, NO! Then you wake up in the morning going, Son of a bitch I'm flat! - Came to see him in Vegas. Actually came to see Lorna Luft, but I stayed for him. - Looking good.. Give her mouth to mouth so she can see the whole show, okay? - I managed Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli, Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorm?, Ben Vereen, Paul Anka, Julio Iglesias, Sammy Davis Jr and Engelbert Humperdinck. - You don't want those old jews in florida and the health club Can I get a rub Herbie? And you get the other type - hold the elevator doors! You like that, ain't you? Nazi I saw you're living in German, son of a bitch! Come with my God. So put your mind at ease. A polite God, lady, how about your knees love? Little kids had a straight cat and dog. But this group tonight is from six catalog almost swept God, a bad face of grooving. But they're all high, they think they're out a movie. - First time I was aware of him, I think seeing him in different movies. I think it was like a Kelly's Heroes, you know, and those where you go, Who's that guy? - Were you worried about drills? - No, sir. - Buffen? Now look, I never keep anything from a crew. I don't expect them to keep anything from me. So come on, speak up! - Well, I guess it's area seven Mr Bledsoe. - Did you hear the captain read the operation orders? - That's just it, sir. - They specifically mentioned the Bungle streets. - Burt Lancaster would always come over to me and say, Learn about the submarine, Learn what happens, learn the control. And Gable said, What is he bothering you about the submarine? Just do the lines. - I want this scope up as we dive? - As we dive, sir? - I want to be ready to fire as soon as we level off at 50 ft. I know this is all new to you, but you just have to get used to it. The whole purpose of this drill is to dive and fire as soon as we leave. Let's try it again. Trevis, surface! - Gable was always nice and he always, I always sat in front of his trailer kidding around with him, and Jack would come us and say listen, Tonight, we're going to do something good. While Gable's on the set, you and I gonna get undressed, we go into his dressing room and we lay on the bed and we'll act like with two gay guys having a good time. Why, it's my dressing room, I'm not gonna knock at the door. Well knocking at the door, I think somebody said.., He says, Back Ruby, it's Clark Gable, I'm coming in. We open the door and there he sees the two of us laying on the bed in our underwear hugging each other. He goes, I can't believe that these guys are fags! These kids are fags, I can't believe it! Damn, damn, goddammit they're fags! - I was never offended by his faggot jokes or his black jokes ot his asian jokes because my mother was Vietnamese. No, but I was never I was never offended by any of that because nothing is sacred do you know what I mean. Just kind of yeah, it's all bets are off with him. - I first became aware of Don Rickles probably on the old Tonight Show. The real, not that this is a fake Tonight Show now, but the Johnny Carson Tonight Show. - Here's a dear friend that I affectionately call Mr Warmth. - I grew up in Oak Park Illinois worshiping the Tonight Show. So I became aware of Don watching his repartee with Johnny. - Would you welcome, please Don Rickles. - Johnny would introduce him in a way that you know, something dangerous was about to come onto the stage. - He's also going to host right here, the week of when October the 13th I believe. Would you welcome this year's poster child for rabies Don Rickles! - All right! Yes, yes, all! No I'm not going on. - Come back! - I just showed up and wore a clean shirt, you know that's all I had to do. Anyway when I looked at the rundown and so Rickles was on or gonna be on tomorrow night or whatever it was, when I saw Rickles was gonna be there I got excited. - My parents would watch the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. I was too young to stay up but I would hide at the top of the stairs where they couldn't see me or hear me or know I was there. I heard them laughing so I knew that I was at least hearing something very special. - Would you welcome Mr Warmth, Don Rickles. - He makes up his mind that he's going to ignore Johnny and make a big fuss over me. That's pure Rickles, I mean that's Rickles to the Nth degree. that is Rickles right there. - Johnny would never prepare material for any Don Rickles appearance. Whatever was on Don's mind whatever came out of his mouth. That's the way they would go. - She's been good to me, that's my mother. - Etta Rickles, right out there in the corner. How are you? How are you, darling? - Your mother thinks about the same way mine does. Hi there! Quiet little old lady. - And your mother bless her heart is a reserved lady from the midwest. And when I first met her you said to me, Well your mom doesn't get around too much. And she came in the dressing room and said Hi, and we had more fun, she was so great. When she did that bottle trick.. She takes a whiskey and never hits your mouth. Just throws it in the air and he goes in, his father goes... And mom gets surprised and she goes, Ta-da! - Okay so they didn't want to make a big thing out of it. - But I must have seen him early in his earlier days and on the Tonight Show. And he was like a representative of the black people before we had a lot of black comedians on TV. It was more like the Jewish ethnic, all comedians were Jewish and today but.. He was more a black taste of comedian. so I must been five or six and I was watching uh Don Rickles And of course the reason I'm in the business. Red Skelton, Red Buttons, Red Fox, Pinky Lee, you know all people of color. - My next guest and good friend Mr Warmth, Don Rickles is finally very busy. His television series C. P. O. Sharkey seen on NBC wednesdays at nine will still be on this fall. Thank you. That's a new record. Rickles has lost more pilots in the Japanese air force. - One time on the Tonight Show, he went on to the audience and there are two kids, he has two kids, he said, You know what's your name? Kid giving his name, he slapped him in the face, Don't lie to me! What is he doing, he's out of control! You don't do that to the audience, just slapping the audience. It's not a it's not an actor it's not somebody in show business. The poor kid is, he just told him his name. But even the absurdity, why are you on television? Why are you part of this audience? It's all absurd. - I was a fan of him on C. P. O. Sharkey back on NBC in the seventies. So, I mean every time he was on the Tonight Show I always watched. I remember one time.. - I was guest hosting for Johnny Carson and Don was a guest, and we were talking and talking. And and Don gestured somehow and he slammed, he slammed his hand down on the desk and he broke Johnny's cigarette box. Johnny had a wooden cigarette box. - This is not your line, you're crazy and you're not going to have that line, you're stupid, but you're not gonna have the land! This is not your line you take! Huh! Of course in cigarette box! - Oh! Fucking Carson's cigarette box! - Of course everybody went, Ooo! Oh, you're in trouble now. Oh! - What the hell happened with this? You know how long I've had this cigarette box on this desk. - You brought that up from New York city? - I brought this up from New York. - What on earth.. - It happened last night? - Who? - Don Rickles? - I did not see.. - Don Rickles did it last night. He's taping across the hall, C. P. O. Sharkey. - Can I get over there? Can I get over there? Be right back! - They walk through the hallway and they took the camera with him back there which was like really innovative at that time, because you never really saw what was going on backstage And Don was rehearsing, he was in his navy outfit and they went at it. - Are they on the air? I don't give a damn if you're on the air. Rickles! Rickles, hold, stop the taping! Stop the taping! Somebody broke my cigarette box. Come here, come here. We're taping. I just started the show. I picked my box up off my desk I had for nine years. My box is broken! They told me, they told me you broke it on the show last night. - Well, I really... - I, I I.. - No, but I'm sorry about the box, I will come up with something. - Well, I hope so. - But just keep me on your show. You mean so much to me, can I? - No, wait, no, no, no. Don't humble yourself. - Please, I wanna be with you, soulmate. - Don't humble yourself. I want something back, Carry on, carry on and we'll see. - John Carson! - They know who I am! Wait a minute, why do you.. Why do you always do that? Johnny Carson. They know who I am! Don Rickles! What is that? I'm going back to work. Okay, now, what do we do? Well that's, I mean to me that's the ultimate to have Don come on, because I used to watch him with Johnny and you know to see him try to nail me j with your stupid cars! And he makes me laugh, you know. Him, Rodney all the all the sort of the kings of comedy. - You told me I was gonna have a career! Since casino, I'm in the toilet, I can't get a job! I don't know what the hell is the matter? Didn't I make a fuss? Didn't I walk around your mother and tell her? Didn't I say her I'll tell you where the medicine is? Can I do that? Didn't I say you were normal when you're wheezing and spitting up behind the camera with that lousy oxygen mask? Come on, you never lied to me, you ruined my damn career! I don't need it! - I was, the asthma, the asthma spray. I didn't have one on me on the.. I've got so I couldn't do it. I couldn't, I couldn't breathe, I couldn't breathe. It was, it was merciless, merciless classic. - Who else is in that age group? Still packs them in the house in Vegas and you know, does it some Indian casino. You know when I go places I go, who is just here? Rickles! Rickles is just here? He's 80! - Will I be performing when I'm 80? Yes, I Don will be gone by then and I will be doing his act. - My father, his name was Max Rickles. Max S which we never knew what the S stood for. My mother's name was Etta Feldman, her maiden name. She was born here in the United States. My father was born in Russia. and came here when he was three with a gun grenade and a picture of Stalin in his pants. I was born in 1926. Donald, J Rickles, J. A. Y. I don't know J. A. Y. for Jay, Rickles. I was raised in a place called Jackson Heights, Long Island. Once I ran away from home. I got fed up, my mother was yelling at me and I said, I'm leaving! In those days, there was on the corner of the 5th Avenue bus used to be. My mother packed a little bag and said, Goodbye. I said, Okay, tell my father I left. I was a baby 9, 8 years old. So and I went to the corner, stood by the bus. My mother opened the window and yelled out, You forgot your sweater! And ever since I was a kid, I made fun of people used to make fun of my mother of the way she smoked a cigarette. Then on my way I drove a car. They were, my cousins rode their bikes in the schoolyard and girls I always had a problem with girls, 'cause I was a smart ass, pretty much what I am tonight, always with the smart ass remarks. And invariably girls just like, Here comes big mouth! He's so crude, he has no class, big mouth is coming! Then I get them under the stupe, and they go, Go big mouth go! I went to Newtown High School. I was president of the school, I was president of basketball, dramatic society and failing every subject. And I got a lucky break, World War II came. I was so happy, I got a job with the Navy. Told them when I enlisted at a Grand Central station in New York, I do, I do comedy and jokes, and I'm an impressionist, and I'm an entertainer. Fine, I'd like to be in special services.. They said, Fine. And they stamped my papers and next thing you know about a train with the shades down. I'm a special service, where am I going? Don't worry. Bam-bam-bam. And I sent my ass to the Philippines for 2. 5 years. I was on a PT tender, 300 men. And PT tender was where the PT boats would get repaired and they go into a tax in the islands, we stayed in place called Lady in Tacloban in the Philippines. And all I remember I was a guy running around the jungle going, where are you Joe? Where are you Joe? When they said attack, I kept saying I'm a special service, I don't do this, I'm supposed to do comedy, and they said, Keep firing. After I conquered the Japanese, I came back to conquer Broadway. I really didn't want to be a comedian, I thought I'd be an actor. My mother was very supportive and my father too, but they were worried because like any other jewish family, they said, what if you could only get, you know, more secure job, where's he gonna be being an actor? The american Academy of Dramatic Arts And I was delighted and I got in the class and it's a long story. I became great friends with Jason Robards, he was dear friend. And Tom Poston is still a friend. And Anne Bancroft who was in my class but we weren't buddy-buddy. John Ericsson, Don Murray a lot of guys. Grace Kelly was in the class behind me.

She was very nice, but I never had any conversation with her, but I wanted to be with her so bad, I could have been a prince. There was a fellow called Phil Lober, a great director.

Why what's the matter with Charlie? And a set would almost fall down. What the hell is the matter with Charlie? You know. I was always out of control and then I would try to calm down and he say, Do me a favor, never forget. He said, Never lose that energy because that energy is going to make you pretty important.

When I when I heard drums, I started taking my clothes off. - We met in Washington D. C. I was working at a strip club called the Blue Mirror. My job was to sing a couple of songs in between the strippers just so they can dried them down. And then I then I then I went out to sing a couple and then they came out and danced and when they sweated they dried them off. And then I had to do another set. And Don was working at a place called the Wayne Room. - Here's a place where I'm walking around going, You're dumbbell! Wait, when they.. Bring out the broad Shut up, Charlies!
