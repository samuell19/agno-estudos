- Please don't kill me. I'll do anything that you want. Do you want to kiss me? Is that what you want? You want me to take my clothes off? You... You want to touch me? You can touch me. Is that what you like? You want to see more? - What's the matter? - I'm sorry, I just... I wasn't sure if-- - Adele told you there was gonna be nudity, right? - Yeah, we want to make real sure that signal doesn't get crossed. - Yeah, no, I'm sorry. I just, I wasn't sure if-- - oh, she's wondering if we needed her to-- - oh, you mean like right now? - Yeah, no. That's not necessary. - Okay. - Yeah, we can see how beautiful you are. - No, look, it's... We appreciate your determination, but she did tell you that the nudity is fairly extensive though, Adele, right? - Um, she just said that there was nudity. - Nah, it's extensive. - You're okay with that? Is that? 'Cause if it's not cool. - What we're saying is we need someone who's not gonna-- - yeah, we cannot show up on set, and have the girl just change her mind at the last minute, you know? - Yeah, no. Adele explained it to me. - Okay, but sometimes, even then, the agent and manager explain it, and then, you gotta tell us now, because this film, the way we're gonna shoot's gonna be very verite. A lot of long takes. It would, it has to be you. It can't be a double. - Don't worry, sweetheart. We'll make sure you look beautiful. - Uh, yeah, no, that's fine. That's fine. Um, should I? - Yes, please. - Can we go back? - Sure. Where are we going back to, honey? - Oh, um. How about, "I'll do anything you want?" Is that okay? - Yeah, whatever, sweetheart. It's all about you. - You want to kiss me? Is that what you want? - You think I'm gonna fall for that? - I don't know. I don't know what you want from me. I'll take my clothes off. You want to touch me? You can touch me. Yeah, you like that? You want to see more? You can see more. Is that what you want? You want me to take my clothes off? You want to touch me? You can touch me. Is that what you want? It's just a couple of days. - It's three nights. Four days. Movie you auditioned for today, where does it shoot? - Um, in Colombia. - The country? - No, the city, in Missouri. - Is it a slasher film? They're, what, meth addicts? Zombie meth addicts on icicles? Please tell me you're not running around naked, screaming and crying. You're hiding your body from me? Beth. You know, there's a hundred art films. If you want mine, i can download right now, where you had your fucking clothes off. You know that, right? What about it? Are you getting naked again, or what? - I don't know. I didn't read the whole script. You want me to cancel my trip? - No. I'm sorry. I'm a jerk. - I just feel like a bad friend. - Hey, stop talking like that. You're a good friend. The two of you will go away, have a nice time. It'll be good for you. What? I like Anna. - No you don't. - I do. - You think she's a bully. - She's a little intense. Just, the whole career obsession thing. I just don't know if it's such a great influence for you to be around, that's all. But I like Anna. - You're a terrible liar. You are. Maybe that's why I trust you. - You trust me? - Mm-hmm. - Big mistake. Big mistake. Hey. - Hmm? - Sorry for the way i talked to you before. It wasn't nice. Wish it didn't bother me so much, but it does. I'm sorry. - I mean, do you think that i like to take my clothes off in a room full of hot lights and total strangers? - If you don't, why do you do it? - What's this? The guy who gave me the estimate said my spark plugs were misfiring or something? - Right. Well, also, there was a problem with your oxygen sensor, but, don't worry, we took care of that for you. - Oh, you did. Okay, what are you doing right now? - Ma'am? - Are you lying to me? Because the guy who gave me the estimate didn't say anything about any oxygen sensor. He said my spark plugs were misfiring. - Well, ma'am. I apologize if that's the case, but-- - what? What do you mean, if? I assure you that's the case. - Well, I apologize for the confusion, but-- - there is no confusion. The guy who gave me the estimate didn't say anything about any, what, fucking oxygen sensor. - Well, ma'am, the fact of the matter is that oxygen sensor has malfunctioned fairly frequently. - Oh, I bet they do. - I take pride in running an honest business, so I apologize if some mistake was made here-- - okay, now you keep saying if. A mistake was made. A mistake was definitely made. - Ma'am, there's no need to raise your voice here. - No? I show up here expecting to pay for one repair, and there's an extra charge for 300 fucking dollars slipped in that I know absolutely nothing about? - Okay, there is no need for that kind of language, ma'am. - Okay, well $300 is a lot of fucking money to me, so you'll excuse me if i don't appreciate the fact that you're trying to fucking steal it from me. - I'm doing no such thing. Oxygen sensors fail all the time. If you've got a broken one and you don't repair it, your car's gas mileage is gonna drop, and over time, it's gonna cost you a lot more. - No, no, no. That's not the point. The point is it wasn't in the estimate. Even if you're telling the truth, I didn't approve of the repair. That's all that matters. - Well, ma'am, normally i would give the customer the benefit of the doubt, but the fact is, I really don't like your attitude. - Oh, I'm sorry. You don't like my attitude? - That's right. I mean, if you were a touch more ladylike. - Are you fucking kidding me? This is your fucking problem, not mine. - I wasn't there. I don't know who said what. - Oh, you're just absolving yourself of any responsibility now? Fine. You know what, I'm not gonna stand here and argue with a fucking criminal. I'll pay for the spark plugs, but I'm disputing the rest of the charges. - Houses, apartments, condos. Offices-- - Paul? Whoa. - Hi. - Hi, how's it going? - Good, how are you? - You're not behind the counter. Not used to that. - It's my day off. - Yeah, uh-huh. - Where you going? - Uh, camping. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm - cool. - Where about? - Big sur. - Big sur. - Yeah. - That's where this one's going. Her and Anna. Anna's aunt's got a house up there. Little old girls getaway. - Like now? - Yeah, just, for the weekend. - Weird. No, no. It's funny, 'cause I was just thinking about you the other day, you know. I'm doing this short, and I was thinking of using Anna. Yeah, I would just call her, but there's no money, so I didn't wanna like offend her. Do you think she'd be offended if? Do you think she'd do it for free? - No, no, she'd probably, she'd probably do it. Yeah, she usually does whatever. - Okay. - Okay. - Yeah. - Cool. - Maybe I'll see you up there? - Yeah. - Cool. - You okay? - Yeah, fine. I'm fine. - She's here! All right. Got everything? - Yeah. - I'll get that. - Thank you. - Well, okay, but you're not listening to me. I don't have the fucking money. - A hardship letter could result in lower late fees. - No, I don't want lower late fees! I want no late fees, because this isn't my fucking fault. It's your fault. Then we're gonna have to freeze your card. - Well, fuck you. - Um, do you want me to drive? - No, it's fine. - I'm really sorry about that. - It's fine. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm fine. You look tired. - Uh, yeah, I guess, maybe. - I guess you've been really busy, right? - Not really. - Okay, ready? - Is your boss still harassing you? - Of course. I'm his favorite. He told me he had a dream when he came on my tits the other day, so. - Oh my god, you have to quit. - The money's just not as good, and I can't afford to take - tuxedo park, that like rich place, the mansion. - I forgot about tuxedo park. - Yeah. - Was that where it was? - Yes, don't you remember we like thought we were gonna go to this horrible slum thing, and it ended up being this mansion, and we didn't-- - tuxedo park. - Yes, and everybody was actually wearing a tuxedo in tuxedo park. - And we had like jeans, and nothing else. - Yes, yes, yes. - Him. Him. - He liked me. - Yeah, he did. He totally did. - Oh my god, when did he tell you that? - I think when I was working at union pool. - Wait a second. When did you work at union pool? - That time that I was guest djing with that boy that I liked. - Who was the boy that you liked? - That guy, Steven. - Oh, god, he was such an asshole. - No, he wasn't that bad. - Are you? He walked all over you. - Not really. - Oh, shit, I can't believe I forgot to tell you this. I saw him before i moved out here. - You did? - Yeah, he was like sitting on the ground outside the Starbucks in union square, and he had this like mustache. - Well, I'm not like necessarily against a mustache. - No, no, no, no, no. This was like a straggly like wispy situation. - Ew. - - It was glazed. It was horrible. - Ew. - I think he had a nose bleed. - Oh my god, you're messing with me. - I think he was just like bleeding all over the sidewalk. - You're totally lying, you're totally lying to me. - No, I'm pretty sure that's what happened. - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. - Wait, so he told you he liked me? - Who, Blake. - Yeah. - Yes, I think so. - Why didn't you tell me? - I am telling you. - Well, yeah, thanks. Like five years later. - I didn't know that you liked him. You really liked him? - Yes. - Whoops. - I feel like you're wrong anyways. - No, I'm not. - Yes, you are, and I'm remembering sort of-- - excuse me. I am so sorry to interrupt. I mean, I never do anything like this. I'm actually a private person, you know, myself, but, haven't I seen you in something? You're in TV, right? - Yeah. - I knew it. I knew it. What have I seen you in? - I don't know. - Oh, gosh. I know it is. I think I know. Oh, I know, I remember, it's wendecalm. You are so good in that. - Uh, thank you. - You were so good. - Thanks. - And so nice. Do you mind if i get your autograph? Because it would mean a lot to me. I'm Sandra. - Sure. Sure. - Nice to meet you. Here's a fountain pen. I hope you like it. - This is my friend, Anna. She's also an actress. - Have i seen you in anything? - No, I would be surprised. - I am just blown away by this. Do you mind if I take a photo? - No, not at all. - Oh, my god. I'm like just so excited about this, I can't even tell you. Uh, it's right there. Thank you. Thank you. - Sure. - Okay, one, two, three. She went away. She turned the office into a guest room, so that my cousin could stay with her. - Oh, nice. - Yeah, but he's obviously not here anymore, so. - Great. Perfect. - Better, right? - Yeah, I love it. - Yeah, it's way better. It's beautiful, huh? - Hmm? - The view. - Still don't get any reception, huh? Do you remember that guy, Ryan? The one whose short I did that went to Sundance? Well, he sent me this feature script he's been working on, and he really wanted me to show it to this producer on that movie I shot last June. I guess he like really wants to work with this one producer, and like, wanted me to show it to him. Oh, I left my shampoo in my bag. Do you mind grabbing it for me? Thanks. - So, what did you tell him? - Oh, so I told him that i didn't have a chance. Show the producers, you know, and he was like, "what do you mean you don't have a chance? "You've been on set all week." And I was like, "yeah, but the producers aren't even there "every day." I don't know. I just feel like he expects so much from me, and I, I'm just getting my feet wet, you know? - Wait, what? - What? - You're in the united Hollywood issue? Why didn't you tell me about this? - Where did you get that? - From your bag. Why didn't you tell me this happened? - I don't know. - Do you think i wouldn't find out? - I, I really didn't think about it. - I mean, this is crazy. This is so cool. I can't believe you wouldn't have mentioned this before. - I don't know. I really, really don't think it's that big a deal. - It's a really big deal. - I'm sorry. - You don't have to apologize to me. You should just be more excited when things like this happen. - No, you're right. You hit him? - No, I mean, i didn't hit him. I like shoved him. - But like, hard? - Uh, well, kind of. Okay, we were standing at the bar, and Josh was saying something that I like really didn't agree with, and so I chimed in, but obviously, it was a bar, so I started speaking loudly, you know what I mean? - Right. Oh, I'm okay. Um, do you want some of this, 'cause it's really good. - No. - All right. - Are you really not gonna have any? - Yeah, I mean, I'd like to, but I just, I've been sleeping so much better since I stopped. - I know, but it's not like you have to get up for an audition tomorrow morning. Come on. - Okay, just a little bit. A little. - Okay. - A little bit-- - these are very small glasses. - That is not a little bit. Um, was Henry there? - Where? What, at the bar? - Yeah. - No, he was the one who encouraged me to participate in the conversation in the first place, and so I was doing that, i was just joining in, and Josh was like, oh, okay, just, "first of all, can you calm down?" - That's so annoying. - Right? I mean, Jesus. If I was a boy, no one would be telling me to calm down. - True. - Oh, come on, Beth. Has anyone ever told you to calm down in your life? Exactly. Anyways, yeah, so I could feel myself getting like really upset, but I stopped myself, 'cause I was like, no, no, this is your boyfriend's manager. You can't like, so, I walked away, 'cause i was about to cry, and, then he comes after me. - Josh did? - Yes, and I'm like, "Josh, listen. "I have a really bad temper. "I need you to give me some space, okay?" And he was like, "yeah, yeah, yeah. "Okay, fine, but you know, you don't have to walk away "like a prima Donna." - Oh my god. - Like, what? And he just kept saying that, like prima Donna, prima Donna, prima Donna. - That is awful. - Yeah, and so, of course, I started like hysterically crying, and I was so upset that yes, I pushed him. What? What would you do? You wouldn't get involved in the first place. Just feel so out of control. - No. No, no, that's really frustrating, what happened to you. - Yeah. And now, Henry's shooting a commercial in Singapore, and he's letting me stay at the house until he gets back, but after that, I'm like. No, you know what? I don't know. Henry's thinking was like, career is important, but if you're in a relationship, then you have to put that first, right? But like I always knew that i just wasn't gonna be happy unless I accomplish certain things first. Like, if you want to be an actress, you have to establish yourself before you're 30, or else, you're fucked. Plus, I really need to focus on finding good representation. Especially, now, before pilot season. God, you're so lucky to get paid to do what you love. - Yeah, I mean, the stuff that I do isn't exactly Gibson, you know? - Yeah, but, I mean, it beats waiting tables. I've spent so much money on head shots and stupid fucking invisible braces. Stop, I'm fine. Seriously, I feel good. And hey, what the fuck? It will all be over soon enough anyways, right? - Give me the keys. - Excuse me? - Give me the keys, bitch. - Why? - Because you almost just killed us like five times. Come on. Sazerac, and speaking in tongues. - Thank you. - Here, no I can get us-- - no, no, no. I got it. Can we keep it open? - No, Beth. I can get my own drink-- - I got it, I got it. - I can pay for my own drink. - I know you can, but that stupid beer commercial I did is playing like a hundred times a day, and I'm making a lot of money, and I want to buy my best friend a drink, okay? - Okay, thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers. Mmm. - Mmm. I know that I haven't been the greatest friend lately. - Oh, Jesus, you're as drunk as I am. - No, I'm serious. I've been a bad friend. I mean, you broke up with Henry, what, like two months ago, and i just found out today? I really should have been there for you. You must hate me. - I don't hate you. - I really, I really love you, Anna. You know that, right? And I'm really glad that we got to have this weekend, alone. I've really missed you. - Yeah, I miss you too. - And I know that like, a lot has changed, and you're going through some hard stuff right now, but I just, I think you should know that I think you are such a beautiful, wonderful person, and you are so, so, so talented, and I just know that everything's gonna be fine. What? - No, don't look. - The situation's pretty sticky over there. The Chinese actually held me for a couple of days on my last visit, and, my translator sort of was a double agent, and kinda got me out of it. - How? - He just, sort of knew what they wanted to hear. - Um, cheers. - Cheers. - How did you get the money over there? - I delivered it in a suitcase. - How much? - I think it was about 50 grand. - Oh my god, that's amazing. - Well, it's, it's not like I, I don't know, I've done this kind of thing my whole life. I mean, you'll see, you get older. - Oh, stop it, you're not old. - Really? How old do you think I am? - I don't know. 20. - I'm 48. - 48, you're a young boy. - Please, I could be your father. - Well, I like men with a little salt and pepper in his hair. - Really? - Um, okay, well is that like what you're doing here, or is there a zendo around here or something? - Uh, well, tibetans don't practice zen. They belong to the mahayana school. Why? Do you practice zen? - No, my ex had a phase. - Oh. Well, there is a zendo here. It's, oh actually, it's a monastery. Tassajara, but, I'm actually here for a men's retreat at esalen. - I know what goes on there? - You do? What? - That's where you guys like sit around a fire, and like, bang drums, and thump your chest, and everything, right? - Well, we do a little of that, if stuff comes up. - Stuff? If like stuff comes up? What sort of stuff? - Well, I don't know. Competition. - Competition? What does that mean? Like, what? What sort of competition? - You should check out tassajara while you're here, and maybe, spend a few days in silent meditation. - Shut up, I'm just asking. - Is she always like this? - Excuse me. - Your friend, is she always so, um. - So what? - Curious? - So curious? I don't think that's what you were gonna say. - No, no, it's just you're very inquisitive. - I mean, I think this is interesting. You are in a group with a bunch of guys that if they get jealous of you, you wrestle them. Like, what? - Can I get some help over here? - Oh, come on. You can't handle just like a couple of questions. If I was in a woman's group, you wouldn't be like, hey, that's something I'd like to know a little more about? - Will you excuse me for just a sec. - Yeah. - I should, I should probably get going. I have gotta get up at the ass crack of dawn tomorrow for a men's hike, but, excuse me. I am taking off. I'd like to buy this young lady a drink. What were you drinking? - Uh, I guess I'll get another sazerac. - Sazerac, and what was Beth drinking? I can't remember. - Uh, it was like a speaking in tongues. - Speaking in tongues, and a speaking in tongues. That should be plenty. Thank you. But, it's really nice meeting you. - Mm-hmm. Anna. - Anna. I'm sorry. Very nice to meet you, Anna. - Yeah, go, warm up. - Good night. - Bye. - Hey, it's me. I'm just checking in. You're asleep. Anyway, I wanted to tell you that I really, really love you, and I miss you. There's no reception at the house, so if I don't answer, that's why, but I love you. Okay. I love you. Bye. - Hey, you. I was wondering where you snuck off to. - Oh, I was just making a call. - The reception really sucks out here. - Yeah. - It's the mountains. Listen, I was wondering if, I don't know, would you be interested in maybe getting a drink sometime? - Oh, uh. I mean, I'm here with my friend. - No, I mean, back in la. - Oh, right. Obviously. - Or, we could, we can get dinner. I have, a friend of mine, bill, they just opened up this place, in abakany, that, it's nice, the chef's kaiser michelin star. Um, how would next Friday work? - Um. Sure. - Okay. Um, can I get your number? - Oh, yeah. Morning. - What's that? - Oh, it's just this stupid script. So stupid. - What is it? - It's this, it's just a really dumb horror movie. - Another one? - Yeah, I know. This one is especially stupid. It's embarrassing. - What's it about? - Um, it's nothing. It's just, um. - It's about nothing? - It's about stones. It's set in Iceland, where, i guess, they have this whole mythology where stones turn into trolls, but it's a red herring, because it's a serial killer, only you think it's trolls for a while. - This is something Adele gave you? - Um, it's, yeah. I mean, it's really terrible. - Okay, but, she wants you to do it? - I think so. - Why? - Um, I don't know. It's bigger. - Yeah, but why does she want you to do it? - I guess, because I'm in every scene. - It's the lead? - I guess. I mean, yeah, yeah. Also, also, it's against type. What's your type? - I don't know. - What, like the wilting flower type? - I guess. - And what's this? - Uh, I don't know, like sassy, I guess. It's really so bad. It's so bad. - You have to take your clothes off? - What do you think? - Jesus, again. - I know. I know, it's like the tenth time in two years. - You ever feel like a whore? - Um. I don't know, yeah, sometimes, a little. I wanted to tell you, I sent the link to your reel, to Adele. - You did? When did you send it? - Um, I don't know, like a while ago. - Like what? Like, a month ago? - Yeah, maybe two weeks ago. I don't know why you want to work with her, though. I mean, they send me out on the worst stuff. - It must be nice not being all alone, though. Like to have somebody besides yourself invested in your career. - I mean, yeah, I guess, when you put it that way. - What other way is there to put it? You want to run it? - What, this? - No, let's do some other script we were talking about. - No, not really. - Maybe I can help. There's really no point. I'm totally wrong for it. - Come on. It'll be fun. We never get to act together anymore. Okay. I think it's time we started to think outside the box. - Outside the box? - Yeah. - I've never even understood what that means. - Outside the box? It means to like think in a different way. - Really? - This isn't the time for sarcasm, sharlene. We're stuck out here in the middle of the arctic tundra, freezing our asses off. Our thermos is almost empty. I've had to pee for like six hours, but I'm afraid to go, because I think the pee might freeze inside my dick. - You have a dick? I thought you were a dick. - Really? That's how you're gonna say the line? Jesus, Beth, no wonder you keep getting typecast. You're supposed to be sassy, right? So, be sassy. - I don't even want the part. - Oh, bullshit. Just be fucking sassy. What the fuck? It's easy. Here, you be the guy. - I think it's time we started to think outside the box. - Outside the box? - Yep. - I've never even understood what that means. - Outside the box. It means like to think in a different way. - Oh, really? - This isn't the time for sarcasm, sharlene. We're stuck out here in the middle of the arctic tundra, freezing our asses off. Our thermos is almost empty. I've had to pee for like six hours, but I'm afraid to go, because I think the pee might freeze inside my dick. - Oh, you have a dick? I thought you just were a dick. - Is that helpful? - Was it helpful when you dragged me out here on this so-called adventure? Was it helpful when you ate all the food, like a fucking pig, four hours ago? - I offered you a bite. - You're a fucking retard. - That's not PC. - You think I give a shit about PC? We're gonna die out here. Do you get that, you piece of shit? We're going to die, and it's your fucking fault! You're life is over. My life is over. We are gonna freeze to fucking death in the fucking freezing tundra, and it's your fucking fault! That's how you play sassy. Let's go for a hike. Is that Matt Dickinson? - Hey. - Hi. - - Hi, how are you? - Good, how are you? - I was wondering if i was gonna bump into you guys. - What? What are you doing here? - You didn't tell her? Am I that unmemorable? No, I just bumped into Beth at capecita, and mentioned i was coming up here. - Oh. No, she didn't mention that at all. What are you doing here? - Uh, well, I'm hiking, but I'm also location scouting for this experimental short I'm doing. - Oh. - I was telling Beth that i wanted to talk to you about maybe being in it. - Oh. Uh, cool. - Yeah, yeah. It's super low budget, but, you really didn't mention this? - Yeah, what are you trying to do? Keep me from getting cast in things? You should just cast Beth. Everyone else does. - Oh, yeah. I know, right? Beth's way too big time for us now. - Yep, well, anyways, thanks for thinking of me. That's awesome. - Yeah, no. Figured, I don't know, it'd be something that you'd be up for. - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. - Paul said he saw your last short online, and it was interesting. You're really lucky. - Have you been to big sur bakery yet? - No, do they have cookies. - Uh, yeah, they have really good cookies. They also have really good dinner. - Awesome. Yeah, I'll have to try that. - Where are you staying? - This really fancy place, super in the middle of nowhere. Just opened up. - Oh, what's it called? - It's called a tent in the woods. What about you all? - I'm staying at my aunt's house. It's, do you know the area at all? - Yeah. - Okay, it's just off the road, near big sur station. - Oh, pfeiffer Ridge? - Yeah. Well, sycamore canyon, but yeah, yeah. You do know the area. - Can I talk to you for a second? - Uh, now? - Yeah. - Okay. Um, well, I guess I have to go. - Is she okay? - Yeah. I mean, I'm sure she'll be fine. - Okay. Yeah, well, I'll give you a call. Think I have your number. - Yeah. I mean, I know we're Facebook friends, so... - Right. So, if I don't have your number, I'll just-- - yeah, right. Yeah. I'm really sorry about her-- - oh, no. Of course. Go, go, go. - Okay, bye. - Bye. - What is it? - It's just. - What? - I just never seen someone look at me with so much disgust? I just, I just realized how much you hate me, and I, I feel really sad about our friendship. - Hey, you all right? - Yeah. Yeah. - You sure? - Yeah. - You don't want a lift? - No, I'm not going that far. I'm fine. - I'm not gonna do anything. I'm just trying to be nice. Where you going? - Um. Sycamore canyon. - That's not close. That's five miles down the road. Come on, it's gonna get cold. Come on. Hey, it's okay. Nice place. - Hello, hello. - Hello. - Hello. Paul? Yes, yes. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Paul. Hold on. I'm gonna call you back from the land line, okay? Please, don't go anywhere. This weekend's a fucking disaster. Honey, can you speak up? - No, I am telling you, she fucking hates me. She thinks that I have this like amazing career, and that I purposely fucked her over. Beth, can you speak up? - No, I can't speak up. I don't know if she's here or not. I can't hear you. - Uh, she thinks I fucked her over on purpose. - Why does she think you fucked her over? - Because I didn't tell her about Matt's thing. - What thing? - The thing. The short. Matt's thing, Matt's short film. - What? - It doesn't matter. It's mainly the thing with Adele. What thing with Adele? - Oh my god, do you even listen to me when I talk to you? She wanted me to send Adele her reel? Don't you remember me telling you that? - Right, yeah. You thought it was too soon. - Exactly, and I was going to send it, but I had only been with Adele for like three months, and she wanted me to send Adele the link to her awful fucking website, and I was going to do it, but then she got so crazy and intense about it, so then, I just told her that I had sent it. - I really don't understand why you do stuff like that. - I was going to send it. Yeah, well, why lie? - Could you not give me the third degree right now? I am telling you, she's acting completely fucking crazy. - You sure you don't want me to come up there and get you? - No. No. I'll just check into a hotel or something. I just, this is all because i got cast in a couple of terrible fucking movies that I didn't even want to be in in the first place. Let me come get you. - No. - I'll come get you after my meeting. - I just. Why can't she just be happy for me? I just am trying so hard to be nice to her, even though she's so disgusting and desperate. I mean, she knows that i think she's a better actress than I am. I just happen to have a fucking certain look that people like right now. - Beth. - I have to go. - You think I'm desperate and disgusting? You're fucking pathetic. Jesus, you act so fucking innocent. But you're not. I mean, you're a fucking liar, right? Tell me, does it get tiring just pretending to be so fucking helpless all the time? God, you think you're so much better than me. You're not. You're a fucking phony, and a narcissist, and a horrible fucking friend. You can't even help me get a part in a fucking avant-garde short? What? Yes, cry, Beth. Cry. Fake fucking crocodile tears. You fake fucking Hollywood cunt. - Hey, sweetheart, it's me. I'm on my way up. I have no idea where I'm going, so, can you please call me back? - Just whenever you're ready. This is my second day in big sur, and I'm standing there with this like woman who wants to make sure that the death of her like chihuahua has been avenged. You want a refill? - No, I'm okay. Thank you. Um, no, I just. I shouldn't, i don't really drink. - What are you talking about? You have, you just had a cocktail. - Yes. Um, I just won't be able to sleep if I have more than one. - You think I'm trying to get you drunk? I'm not trying to get you drunk. I took a vow of celibacy for the month, so you're totally safe with me. Seriously, no sex, no masturbation, nothing. I'm basically like a monk. I'm not trying to, I'm sorry. I don't mean to be pushy, I'm just enjoying talking to you. Well, do you want to keep hanging out? I have, um, I close out in 30 minutes. I was thinking, maybe you want to go swimming. I know a place we could go night swimming. - Oh. - Remember, this is like a monk. - Shut up. - Get up. Get up, I want to show you something. Wait, stay still. What are you doing? You gotta give me a pose. First of all, you can't be moving around like that. You can't be moving around like that. You gotta give me a pose. That's the pose you're gonna give me? That is not a pose. What's the matter? Are you feeling self conscious? Stay. Like this. This is great. Just like that, stay like that. Oh, yes. You look like an angel. So, you're an actor. That's cool. - Well, the stuff I do is not exactly you know? - I actually don't, 'cause I don't know what that is. You have any like gigs coming up, or anything? Anything interesting? - No. - Really? - No, nothing. - It seems like maybe you do. - I there's this stupid movie. It's so stupid. - What's it called? - It's called the stones. It's really so dumb. It's this dumb horror movie. - I like horror movies. Really, that's my favorite kind of movie. What is this one? - It's, it's, this one is especially stupid. It's, embarrassing. - Try me. What's it about? - It's about stones. - What about 'em? - It's about stones. It's, I don't know, set in Iceland, where, I guess, they have this weird mythology where stones turn into trolls, or something, only that's a red herring, because, really, it's this serial killer, but, for a while, you think it is trolls, and, I don't know. It's, I told you, it's so embarrassing. - I like it. I think it sounds good, and I'm sure that you're gonna be great in it, and then it'll come out, and be a big hit, and I can tell all my friends I know a movie star. - Just whenever you're ready. - Oh, thanks. - Oh, i forgot to tell you. Lucinda's band is playing this weekend in monterey, and a bunch of us are driving up. I don't know if you're interested. Don't you ever get tired of pretending to be so helpless? - Hey! Where you going? What are you doing? What's the matter with you? You're jealous of Violet? There's nothing going on with Violet. We fucked like a year ago. Like a couple times. There's five girls in this town. It's very flattering. You gonna get over this? She's not looking at us, right? Is she over there? All right. It's very flattering. I have a big day planned for us, though. Okay? I got the day off. I want to take you to a party. It's very sweet. You got jealous. - I don't want to go back to la. - Why not? - Just terrible there. - So stay here. - What would I do? - I don't know. Figure it out. - I could have a garden. - You could. You like gardening? - Mm-hmm. I like being outside in the sun. In the rain, and. - You like fog? There's a lot of fog. - That sounds nice. Being in a garden in the fog. 'Cause I like to cook. - Mmm. I like to eat, so, you see how that worked out? - Mm-hmm. - We're made for each other. - Are you talking about me or the beer? - Matt, it's Paul. Beth's boyfriend. Uh, I'm in big sur, and... I can't seem to get in touch with Beth. - Yeah, hi! What is this? - It's my costume. - It's beautiful, hi. Come on, come on in. Boy, I thought you were gonna be a pig. - I got it at a thrift store. I am a pig. - But you don't look like a pig. - Wait, wait. I'm a capitalist pig. Hold on. - No, you're like that handsome dude in a tux. - No, no, no, I'm a capitalist pig. Look. Look. - All right, you're a capitalist pig. Wait, I gotta, hold, hold on. - I'm like a robber baron. - Joplin come down and see Jesse. Yeah, he's a pig. - Bring it in. My man. - Mom, can i get my costume on? - Yeah, yeah, if you're quick, though. I'm starving. - Cool, let's do it. - Don't give Jesse a hard time. Okay, red is okay? - So, how long have the two of you been going out for? - Oh, we just met yesterday. - Yeah, has he painted your picture yet? - Oh, god, Jack. Don't listen to him. He's just jealous because Jesse brought such a pretty girl home, and he's tired of me, because I'm old. - Yep. - Holy crap. Holy crap, it's Frankenstein! - Save me! Save me! Oh my god! Oh no, I'm gonna faint. Uh, I can't breathe. I can't, I can't. Oh, no, no. He's choking me! Wait, wait, somebody, someone. And I'm back from the dead, and now, I'm gonna kill you! And then, I'm gonna make you set the table. To help mommy. That's what happens to monsters who kill their mothers. - Joplin. - Thank you, universe, for your bounty, beauty, and your love. - That was really good. Very nice. So tell me, what's her deal? - What's her deal? - What, is that? Is that a bad question? - A little bit. - I'm just trying to get to know the girl. - The girl? Now, you're really putting your foot in it. She's a woman. - It's fine. - Oh my god, okay. The woman, I'm sorry. The last time I saw him, he was like, "listen, man, I'm gonna become a monk," so now, you're here, and my curiosity is peaked. - Summer, lay off. Lay off. - Oh my, lay off of what? I'm just talking to, I'm trying to get to know her? - What information? - I don't know, the basics. - Just basics. - - She's an actress. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Summer used to be an actress. - It was another lifetime. I was really bad. - So. Acting is acting. She used to Shakespeare and everything. She's really good. - Thank you, and you are next, if you don't eat your food. I'm sorry, that was sweet. So, do you like it? Acting? - Uh, I don't. Yeah, I guess. - Yeah? You must be really brave? - No, I'm not brave. - No, I think so. - Anybody want more wine? - Yeah, I'll get it. - No, no, no, I'll get it. I'll get it. - No, no, it's fine. - - You sure? - Out back, on the cooler. - Do you ever feel like a whore? - Are you okay? - Huh? Yeah. - Let me see. Let me see. What happened? Does it really hurt? - I don't know. It's nothing. I think there was just some broken glass. - Here. - Thanks. - Does it hurt? I'm gonna put some pressure on it. - No, no, it's okay, it's okay. - I feel like I'm not showing you a good time. I really wasn't expecting to like you this much. You know, when we first met, when I gave you a lift, I thought you were a snob, but for some reason, I just kept thinking about you. Then you came into the bar, and, I was glad. And, I think you're really great. I think you're soft, and, sweet. I feel like you really understand me, or something. I feel like I could want that. You're just a really special person, Beth. - What! - You pretend to be so fucking helpless, but you're actually a fucking liar. - What do you want from me? - I bet you think you're better than me, huh? But you're not. - Please, please. - You're self-obsessed, and you are a horrible fucking friend! - Tell me what you want from me, and I will pay it! I don't know what you want! - That's right, cry. Cry, you fucking bitch. Fake fucking crocodile tears from your fake fucking Hollywood cunt.
