[dynamic music] [gentle music] [birds singing] [music continues] [birds singing] [music continues] Yes? They've started in the conference room. [woman] Okay, good. I need you to pull up a couple of files for me today. I need 'em before lunch. Need State v. Wilkins . The other one is probably in the advance files... I like your attack, but now if you want them to believe your version of the events, you have to make them see it. - You have to-- - Clara? - Sir? - You have call. Just a second. [clears throat] It's the professor. Tell him I'll call him right back. It's about your mother. [gentle music] Excuse me. The earliest memory I have is the sound of my mother's voice. Though I was too young to understand the meaning of her words, I do remember the feeling. The feeling of being drawn to her voice, like a moth to the moon. When I was finally able to understand what she was saying, the feeling only grew stronger. You see, my mother was a storyteller. Some say, the best Savannah had ever known. Oh, people would come from miles around to hear her weave a tale about the low country, and not once did they ever leave disappointed. As I grew older, however, the fascination with my mother's stories began to fade. I found myself longing for more than the hot, languid days of South Georgia. At the age of 17, I finally left the magical, mysterious Savannah of my childhood. And until the day my mother died, Savannah left me. [indistinct chattering] - Hey, Aunt Clara! - Oh, Jamie, look, you're losing your teeth! - Hi, baby. - [dog barking] And you remember Alexa, Philomena's little girl? Yes, I do, her big girl, hi darling. Hi. I'm sorry about your mom. - I liked her a lot. - Thank you. Hmm. I knew there was a lawyer in the house. My skin was starting to crawl. Well, now, hush! This is no time for jokes. Leave him alone, Wallis. Doctors always think they're so funny. You still practicing medicine? [Professor] Good Lord, what the hell did you do to your hair? It's called style, Professor. I doubt if you've ever heard the word. You look beautiful, honey. It's good to see you. Okay, everybody, back to the table. We gotta finish our dinner. [Jamie] But I don't like the peas. Well, I don't mind if you don't like peas, you just have to eat five. - If you don't eat five-- - When did the number - go down? - [Wallis] Oh no, the number went up! [indistinct chattering] [mysterious music] [owl hooting] [water splashing] [water splashing] [tense music] [water splashing] [dog barking] Kids, now hush, hush, hush. You are gonna wake Clara up, shh, quiet! [whispers] You have to keep quiet. Well, I think the key today is to keep her busy. Mm. You know, so she doesn't think too much. Would that be the key to your success, Philomena? [Wallis] Daddy. Very funny, Professor. Oh, Wallis, maybe you and I should take her to the club for lunch. Well, now I believe that is among the worst ideas I ever heard. What? I think that'd be nice. What, you think surrounding a grieving woman with a lot of nosy, drunken housewives is nice? Well, maybe you're right. I have to go see the minister about the service, so, why don't you two take Clara for a nice walk in woods, hm? I can't think of anything more dreadful. I'd love to take a walk in the woods. If it's not a bother. Oh, Clara. Honey. I am so sorry about your mama. Now, if there is anything I can do, anything at all. How about a cup of coffee? Certainly. - Morning. - Morning. You really wanna come for a walk with us? Yeah, I do. - You really wanna take me? - Yeah. Okay. [Alexa] We know where your name's carved in a tree. This is where we put ours. [clears throat] Jamie plus Alexa, the year 2000, best friends forever. Well, look at that. Yours is on the other side. "Wallis plus Clara, 1970. Best friends forever." They call this the friendship tree. Yeah. That's what my mom told us. [Jamie] Whoa! Sometimes he shows up. Sometimes he doesn't. What's his name again? Fish Man. Half fish, half man. Did your mother ever tell you about the man who lived out in the woods? - [Jamie] Nope. - My mother told us about him. She said, "If you ever got lost in the woods, you shouldn't worry, because there's a man who lived out in the woods who would come and get you and bring you back home." And we spent hours and hours trying to get ourselves lost. And finally I said to my mother, I said, "Mama, there ain't no man that lives out in the woods." And she just smiled and said, "Oh yes there is, you just lucky you haven't needed him." You mean, you never saw him? Nope, never did. [bell tolling] [bird cawing] 35 years ago, Mattie Collier showed up at my door with a baby in her arms and asked me for a job. Well, I didn't really have much to offer, but she seemed like a nice woman. So I said to her, "How's your cooking?" Well. She gave me her brightest smile and said, "I guarantee you've never tasted anything like it." [people laugh] [Professor] She was right. Turns out Mattie was one of the worst cooks to ever step foot into the low country. [people laugh] [Professor] I didn't know what to do. But then, about a week later, and maybe 10 pounds lighter, I overheard her telling a bedtime story to the kids. As I listened from the hallway, she lured me into a world I didn't even know existed. A world so full of magic and wonder, that by the end I wanted to pack my bags and go there myself. I knew right then that Mattie Collier had a gift from God. I took her right downstairs that evening, and I said, "Mattie, I cannot let you cook another meal in this house, but I'll tell you what. I'll pay you twice what you're getting now if you'll stay and tell stories." And she looked at me like I was crazy and said, "Tell stories to who?" "To whomever will listen," I answered. With God as my witness, money could not have been better spent. I'm gonna miss Mattie. [clears throat] But I believe we should all take comfort from the knowledge that her spirit remains in every story she ever told. Stories that will be told again, and again, and again. May she grace heaven as she did the Earth. Clara, honey, I want you to meet some neighbors of ours, this is Marianne and Alfred Brooks. Oh yes, hello. - Hi. - My mother told me all about you. As matter of fact, I have one of your photographs on my office wall. That's right. That beautiful old tree. What'd your mama call it? The wishing tree. What's the wishing tree? [Marianne] The wishing tree, my dear, is a magical tree from one of Mattie's stories. I never heard about it. Mattie told you that story at your birthday party. - Don't you remember? - [Jamie] Did not. - Oh, she did! - [all laugh] No. Do you know the story, Clara? Um, I'm afraid I don't remember that one. I do. Will you tell it to us, Grandpa? Please? - [Alexa] Please? Pretty please. - [Jamie] Please. Oh, come on Daddy, tell us. [chuckles] The wishing tree is a very old story. Took place way back in 1851 on a dark and scary August night. It was on that night, a little slave girl named Celia tried to escape from a plantation down the road. Unfortunately, she didn't get very far before the storm came. And what a storm it was! Thunder so loud, it made the trees shake. - Boom! - [thunder rumbles] [chuckles] - [dramatic music] - [thunder cracking] [horse neighing] [men shouting indistinctly] Come back here, girl! - [dogs barking] - [men shouting] Right this way, boys, she's down this way! [music continues] [men shouting] [dogs barking] [thunder cracking] [man] That's it, right here, right here. We got her, we got her! Please, please don't let them get me! - [thunder cracking] - [horse neighing] [man] Celia! [music continues] Come on out of there, girl. I'm gonna have to shoot you down. I mean it, now! [gun firing] You're gonna be dead before you're free, girl. [gun firing repeatedly] [Professor] He could have shot at that tree all night, but it wouldn't have made a bit of difference. You see, Celia was gone! Disappeared! Next morning, she awoke next to an elm tree in Philadelphia. Had no idea where she was or how she got there. But of one thing she was absolutely certain, for the first time in her life, she was free. [chuckles] All because of the wishing tree. [all chuckle] - [Wallis] I like that one. - [Clara] Mm-hmm. Al, can you show us where it is? I wish I could, baby, but I don't remember. Was it close? Well, I believe we walked there so it couldn't be too far. [all chuckling] Alexa, Jamie, you all need to keep track of where you are out there, okay? It's real easy to get lost in them woods, and baby, if you do find that tree, don't go wishing you was someplace else without telling me first, okay? 'Cause you know your daddy don't believe in all that magic stuff. He's just gonna think you've been kidnapped, all right? - There we go. - Can we go now? Uh-huh. Couple of bananas. There you go. - Have a good time. - Okay. That'll keep 'em busy for a while. [Wallis chuckles] You know, I think it's cruel to send them out looking for something you know they're never gonna find. Oh, come on, Clara, they're kids, they're gonna have fun trying. Excuse me. But what makes you two believe they'll never find that tree? [Wallis chuckles] Goodness gracious, Professor, you sound like Mama. What's wrong, Clara? You too grown up to believe in magic? [Wallis chuckles] I wish I was six feet tall. Mark it. What are we gonna do if you really turn six feet tall? Just wish myself back to normal, I guess. What if you only get one wish? I dunno. I guess you'll have to wish me back. Do you think I'm gonna waste my one wish on that? - I'd do it for you! - Would not! Would too! - Would you, really? - Mm-hmm. Well then, I guess I'd do it for you too. I wish...I wish I never had to eat broccoli again. We spent most of that afternoon repotting her plants. In the process, she made certain that I learned the names of all of them. She said it would make them more comfortable. Afterwards, she thanked me with a kiss on the cheek and then went in for her five o'clock nap. I realize now that somehow she knew her time had come. [birds cawing] [gentle music] I can almost hear her humming. You know, a while back, I tried to start a catalog of your mother's stories. Unfortunately, she didn't care too much for talking to a camera, so this is about as far as we got. - "Jenny and Joe." - Yeah, I remember that one. That was about that boy in the Civil War who got killed. But he came back as an angel. Yes, to look after his lovely bride. Yeah, I always thought it was so sad. I thought it'd make a good movie, you know? [Professor chuckles] Oh, "The Secret Life of Louise," "Dolphin." Oh, look, it's "The Wishing Tree." "The Wishing Tree." Oh, ah. More thoughts on the tree that doesn't exist. This is the journal of a one Able Williams. Owned a cotton plantation just outside Savannah. August 17th, 1851, I marked the page. "Another windstorm last night, Celia, Jessie's daughter, tried to run. The dogs caught up with her down near the river and chased her up a tree. By the time we got there, she was nowhere to be found. I'm not sure what happened to little Celia, but I believe the Lord himself must have taken her. Missing, presumed dead." It's very interesting, Professor, but it's hardly proof of a magical tree. Well, you must admit, Clara, that something unusual happened that night. Yeah, of course. A young girl escaped slavery. Look at you two. Can you once agree on something? Well, I'll grant that Clara may very well be right. Yet at the same time, I think she should open her mind to the possibility that she just might be wrong. [gentle music] Would you two excuse me, please? Did I say something wrong? No Daddy, I just... she just needs a moment. [bird cawing] [Jamie] Celia only got one wish. [Alexa] She only used one. I bet she had at least two more coming. [Jamie] Well, I know what I'm gonna wish for. - [Alexa] What? - A hundred more wishes. Jamie, don't be stupid. The tree is gonna know if you try to cheat, and then you'll end up with nothing. We've gotta think of something good. You know, like something nobody else can do. [tense music] Jamie, stop, I'm trying to think. So am I! - [Alexa gasps and screams] - Shh! Shh! Shh. Shh! [mysterious music] - Wow, he's good! - Yeah. [gentle music] [Jamie blows] Whoa! Hey, you okay? Yeah. I just wish I got to see her one last time. Hmm. I imagine wherever she is, she's wishing the same thing. She sure missed you a lot. Yeah, I know. So how come you didn't come visit more often? I was busy, Wallis. You know, sometimes I think she thought you didn't come 'cause of her. Well, I didn't come because I didn't want to end up another poor, uneducated Black woman, dependent upon your father's charity. Why is that so hard to understand? My father's charity? [chuckles] What are you talking about? Oh, come on. You heard him today at the service. After all they've been through, after all this time, all he could say about my mother was, she was some poor Black woman showed up on his doorstep with a baby in her arms, looking for a job. My father loved your mother. He didn't say that, did he? Well, maybe not in so many words, but he loved her and he loves you! I mean, for God's sakes. He is more proud of you than he is of me. I mean, you should hear him bragging on Clara's doing this, and Clara's doing that, I mean. Well, I am very appreciative of everything he's done, but I am not under the illusion that I'm anything more than one of his projects. Well, if that is really how you feel, then I feel sorry for you. Because with all your big education, you don't know anything about love. [gentle music] [dog barking] Clara, we found him! Found who, sweetie? [Alexa] The man you told us about! The one out in the woods. Ah, you did? - [Jamie] And guess what, Clara? - What? - He's magic too. - Really? You wanna meet him? No, I really have to get back to Atlanta. Can't you go back tomorrow? - [Alexa] Please, Clara? - Now kids, you heard what Clara said, she has to get back to work, and you need to wash your hands. Come on, we're gonna eat supper in a few minutes. Go on, skip. Quick like a bunny, let's go, Jamie, come on. - A bunny isn't too quick. - Well, he's pretty quick. You know, you're welcome to stay for dinner if you like. Thanks. But I really think I'd better get on the road while it's still light. Yeah, I guess that would be safer. Come on, scoot now, come on, out you get. [dog barking] Anything else? No, thanks. Godspeed. - Okay. - Mm-hmm. I don't want you staying too long between visits, do you hear? Love you, honey. [gentle music] [car engine starting] [music continues] [bird screeching] [tense music] [bird screeching] [dog barking] Bean! Bean! What are you doing? [dog barking] I'm sorry. I'm sorry, come on. Come here, come here, baby. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, little guy. Bean, I was on my way to Atlanta. You live in Savannah. [sighs] Supposed to be in Savannah. [owl hooting] [dog barking] Stop that barking, stop that. [Clara speaking indistinctly] [dog barking] Hey, Bean. I was about an hour outside of Atlanta and he jumped over the backseat. Well, thanks for bringing him back. Just made a fresh pot of tea. You care to join me? I don't know why. I guess I'm losing my mind, but I keep feeling like, like, um... like Mama's still here. And I know this is strange, but I keep feeling like she doesn't want me to leave. No, no, I don't think that's strange. Not one bit. I just...I know she's here. I can feel her. I can. Every day. And I miss her. I miss her so bad. [both crying] [Wallis sighs] [bird cawing] So is this how y'all spend the afternoons? Listen, honey, you're not Southern if you can't sit and do nothing for a little while. Are you writing country music or are you talking to me? Well, I think Phil's point, Clara, is that sometimes it's nice just to slow down a little bit. Any slower than this and you'll be dead, darling. [chuckles] Well, all right then. All right, come on. We got plenty to do in the garden. Oh no, you have got to be kidding. I don't believe she is, Clara. Come on. [gentle music] [turkey gobbling] [music continues] Did you make this? It's pretty cool. Magic Man, how come you live out here, so far away from everything? Don't you get lonely? Well, don't you have any friends? [gentle music] Now, this was one of Mama Mattie's secrets for keeping the raccoons away. She said you bury three cloves of garlic real close to the base of each plant and leave them there for one week. You know they sell these at the grocery. Yeah, I know that. Like Mama Mattie always said, they taste better when you grow 'em yourself, mm. - [Jamie] Hey, hey! - Mm, mm! Hey, you kids, what y'all doing? - Nothing. - Well then, Al and Marianne, they're looking for you. They got something they wanna show you. - What is it? - I don't know. I guess you're gonna have to go and find out for yourself. Hey, Clara. You wanna come with us? Can you do without me? - Well, I guess I can. - Coming! - So, Clara? - Yes. What else did your mom say about that man in the woods? I don't remember much. Why do you ask? I'm just wondering if it's the same guy we found. Hm, I don't know. Were you lost when you met him? No. It was probably not the same one. 'Cause the one my mama told me about - only came if you got lost. - Hmm. [Clara] Where are we going? [Marianne humming] Clara, maybe you should take a seat. You look a little pale. Is this really for a cookbook? Oh, it's more than a cookbook, dear. It's critter cuisine. You think people will like it? Of course they will. I had armadillo with a nice worm sauce last night. Best meal I've had in years. [Marianne] Al, stop it. This is not for a real cookbook, kids. It's just a joke. Marianne! You didn't tell me. [Marianne chuckles] So, when are you two gonna get married? Not till after college. [Al] Yeah? That's about the time me and the missus first tied the knot. You know, it'll be 30 years next week. Wow. Congratulations. Oh, we're planning a big party. If you're still here then, Clara, we'd love for you to join us. Thank you, I'd be honored. So, you guys wanna know the secret of making the marriage last? Okay. Well, it's actually pretty simple. Laughter. If you're making each other laugh, you're making each other happy. - Ain't that right, honey? - Mm-hmm. Of course, the missus here ain't all that funny. So sometimes I have to pretend. But that's easy. Go ahead, honey, say something. I'll show you funny, mister, just as soon as these children here leave. [laughs] See? That's all it takes. [both giggle] [Marianne laughs] He is funny, isn't he? That's why I love him so much. Come here, baby. Give me a hug. [Marianne laughs] Ah, ah! Oh, oh! [all laughing] Lord, what a mess. I have no idea what these kids were thinking. They packed enough food here to feed an army. [Clara] You know, I'm a lawyer. Why am I the one who's gotta wash the dishes? Oh, you may be a lawyer, but you're my little poobly-- [laughs] Get the phone, will you? - [Wallis laughs] - [Clara speaks indistinctly] Hello? Oh, hi, Phil. No, they're not here. Uh-huh. She think they took her sheets. Her sheets? Oh, excuse me. Her Ralph Loren sheets. So, wh-- Oh, Ralph Lauren sheets. [Wallis chuckles] I couldn't find the picnic blanket. So this will have to do. We've got tons of stuff. Turkey, ham, roast beef. Cheese and crackers. And three different kinds of bread. 'Cause we didn't know which one you'd like. [birds singing] Alexa! Jamie! What should we do with the rest of the food? [clicking tongue] [clicks tongue] [gentle music] [tense music] What are y'all doing? Uh-oh. What are you all doing out here? We were feeding a deer until you showed up. Yeah, I noticed that. Is this a friend of yours? Yeah, it's Magic Man. The one we told you about. I don't remember you telling me about anybody. [Alexa] Clara, yes we did. Did I see you out by the highway the other day? Right, so you live around here? [Alexa] Clara, we told you, he lives out in the woods. Baby, let the man do his own talking. He can't, Clara, he can't talk. Oh, I didn't know. I think he said it's nice to meet ya. It's nice to meet you, too. Magic Man. Does your mother know about this man? No, and you can't tell her. Why not? Because she might think he's weird or something and not let us play with him. Well, she might be right, Jamie. Well, do you think he's weird? No, I don't know, he seems like a nice man. Okay then, you've gotta swear to secrecy. Why? Because, we've gotta know you're not going to tell. No, why secrecy? Your mother will probably think he's fine too, - if she meets him. - No, he's too shy. He doesn't wanna meet anyone else. You've gotta swear, Clara. I'm not swearing to anything. I don't really know him. But I tell you what I will do. I'll keep a secret if you two promise not to go and see him without me. Do we have a deal? - Yeah. - Okay. Good. And by the way, you two are in a heap of trouble for taking all that stuff from the house. But luckily for you, I am an attorney and I might be able to get you out of it. I didn't know they're your favorite sheets, Mom, or else I wouldn't have taken them. Mm. [Alexa] We just want something to build a fort with. But Clara's took us shopping and look, we got you the same ones. Ralph Lauren. Oh, well, isn't that sweet? [Jamie] We also went grocery shopping, Mama, and bought a bunch of new food. But Jamie, that is not the point. I even got you Ben and Jerry's Chunky Monkey, 'cause I know it's your favorite. [Wallis] Now you listen to me young man. You do not go taking things without asking for them first. We don't do those things around this house. I'm sorry, Mom. Well now, did somebody say something about Chunky Monkey? All right, I guess we'll just forget about all this, and have us some ice cream! I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream! - [Jamie] Yay! - [Wallis laughs] - Have you had some already? - [Alexa] Go, let's go! [Wallis] You're getting heavy, come on. - [thunder rumbling] - [mysterious music] [rain pattering] [thunder rumbling] [tense music] [birds calling] [water splashing] [imitating bird call] [imitating bird call] [mysterious music] What they didn't know is that little Celia had found the wishing tree. A tree like none other in the world. So when she said, "Please, please don't let them get me," the tree granted her wish and took her away. A couple of days later, she awoke beneath a towering elm tree. And what little Celia probably thought was heaven turned out to be Philadelphia. Imagine that, thinking any place up north was heaven. [chuckles] [laughs] Oh, I'm just kidding. I hear it's nice up there. [Professor on tape] Tell me something. Why is it that all your stories seem to be set in Georgia? Oh, Professor. [chuckles] I don't just live in Georgia. Georgia lives in me. [Professor on tape] I'm sorry. I'm afraid I don't understand. [chuckles] I doubt you would. Even if I explained it. I still don't know what the hell she meant by that. Go on, go on, I think there's another one on there. [Mattie on tape] Okay. I think we've got time for one more. Oh, here's a good one. This-- [clears throat] This was one of Clara's favorites when she was little. She called it "The Dreamer." Not too long ago, there was a boy by the name of Alvin Bailey, who lived out on Tybee Island. [gentle music] Now Alvin had what his mother liked to call an active imagination. You see, Alvin used to lie all the time. When he didn't chop the wood like he was supposed to, Alvin came up with a story about how a bear ran off with the ax. And when he broke his father's watch, he blamed it on a ghost who lived up in the attic. Now, little Alvin went on for years and years like this, making up excuses for everything. Till one night, he had a dream. He dreamt about a big tree falling on the barn and smashing it to pieces. Well, the next day, a storm came through and just like in Alvin's dream, a tree fell and smashed that barn to bits. Now, little Alvin carried on like you wouldn't believe. But no one believed. No one believed that his dream had come true. Clara? Yeah? You okay? Oh, I'm just doing nothing, y'all. [Wallis chuckles] - Hey, you ready? - [Alexa] Yeah. Um, we'll be back in a bit. We're going to look for the wishing tree. [gentle music] [Alexa] Come on, Jamie! [music continues] [Clara screams] A fish, and a big one! - A big fish, whoa! - [Clara screaming] Can I see it? Can I see it? - [Clara laughs] - Can I see it? Can I see it? [dramatic music] [gentle music] Whoa! [smacking lips] [birds singing] [gentle music] [Alexa] Magic Man. Can we roast some marshmallows? [music continues] So, tell me something. Are you known by another name, besides Magic Man? What is...? [Clara] Thomas! Thomas. Me? C. L. [chuckles] C. L. A? R. I am never gonna remember this. A. Name? Me. Clara. You gave me a name? Clara, Clara. You want me... hear? You...you want me to hear you? That would be nice. Hey, Magic Man. Show Clara one of your tricks. Oh, come on. They must call you Magic Man for a reason. Magic Man, your marshmallow's burning. [Jamie gasps] Oh my God! [kids laugh] Your hands aren't even burnt! Oh yeah, yeah, ha-ha. [both laugh] [blowing rapidly] [kids laugh] [Clara laughs, exclaims] Ah, now, there you are. I thought you said you were just going for a walk. Sorry, we got a little hung up, looking for the wishing tree. You mean to say y'all spent all day looking for that tree? There are a lot of trees out there, Will. And we have a complicated process. - [Will] Huh. - [Wallis] Okay, Jamie, take your napkin up, did you wash your hands before you came in here, young man? Pass the corn over here, honey. - Sure can. - [Wallis] Now then. Jamie, you took off those dirty boots, didn't you? - Oh yes, yes. - [Wallis] Catch anything? [both laugh] Oh, now I got Jamie asking me how come I'm not as cool as Clara. I don't think I'd ever see that day. Remember when we used to sneak beer out here. - Mm. - We thought we were so bad. Yeah, I do. [laughs] But I don't think I ever told you, this is kind of funny, but I never, well, I would drink it like this. - Pretend to take a sip... - [laughs] because I could not stand the taste! [both laugh] No wonder you never had to pee! Well, I gotta pee now! - Are you drinking it? - Yeah, I'm drinking it. It's going in one end, out the other. - I'll tell you what. - Okay, wait, rock it girl, before you go. I got the distance. Okay, eight feet. - Mm, mm. - Mm. Oh-ho! [Wallis and Clara shouting in distance] [Will] They sure are having a good time. Sounds like they're sneaking beers out to the deck again. [Wallis and Clara laughing] - [Alexa] You're it! - [Jamie and Alexa laugh] - [Jamie] You're it! - [Jamie and Alexa shrieking] [Clara] After several years of 72 hour weeks, I decided if I was gonna work that hard, I might as well be working for myself. So, I went out on my own and it was a little scary at first, but three and a half years later I have 32 attorneys and more business than I know what to do with. Oh yes, yeah. It's pretty good for a small town girl, yeah. You know what? There's a party tomorrow. That's an anniversary celebration actually for some neighbors. You should come and meet some folks. Why not? What? Oh! It would mean a lot to Jamie and Alexa, and to me. They're good people, Thomas. [bird cawing] Will you at least think about it? [tense music] Good. Thanks. So I hope to see you tomorrow. [Al] Okay, here we go now. You guys stay right here, come on. Let's stay. Look, if you can see the lens, if you can see the lens, the lens can see you. Okay, come on in a little bit, kids. There you go, come on, it's gonna be great. It's gonna be great. All right. It was easier shooting gazelles on the plains of Africa. Wait one minute, I've gotta go get my lipstick, - I left it in the car. - [Will] Oh, no, no, no. [indistinct chattering] [Al] Okay, okay, are we ready? No, we're still waiting on Clara. - [Will] Where's Clara? - [Jamie] Here she comes! - [Wallis] Oh, yeah! - I'm sorry. I didn't know you were waiting. - [woman] It's about time! - [laughter] Guess who I invited to the party? - Magic Man? - Yep. [Alexa] He gonna come? I don't know, he said he'd think about it. Clara, dear. We need you to stand up straight. You know, honey, we probably have time to still - get a tent. - Trust me, baby. It is not going to rain on this glorious day. Oh, just take the picture. Okay, here we go. - [thunder rumbling] - [everyone clamors] - [camera clicking] - [everyone laughs] [smooth music] Don't worry about it, baby. It ain't even coming this way. You sure about that, Al? Looks like the wind's blowing it in. Son, let me explain something to you. Never let a woman know you've made the mistake I've made today. You will never live it down. Mm. Is that why you're marrying her again? Must be some weather phenomenon we can blame it on. - [thunder rumbling] - [Will] Mm-hmm. Just wouldn't want to be in your shoes. [Al chuckles] You still think he's coming? Pardon me, missy. I hadn't known about the-- What if he doesn't know where we are? I know, I think it's okay. [indistinct chattering] I'm gonna go look for Magic Man. Okay. Bye. [thunder rumbling] [tense music] [wind blowing] [music continues] [man] Do you, Marianne Brooks, promise to love, - respect and cherish-- - And forgive Al Brooks for not getting a tent. [laughter] And forgive Al Brooks for not getting a tent, till death do you part? Hm! [laughter] Kiss, kiss, kiss! - [all cheering] - [thunder rumbling] [Al laughs] I win every time. [Marianne laughs] Where's Jamie? He went to get Magic Man. What? [dramatic music] - [thunder cracking] - [people screaming] [thunder cracking] Jamie! Jamie! Clara, where's Jamie, where's my boy? - He went into the woods. - He went into the woods? - Why? - He's looking for someone. - Jamie! - Who?! Will! Will! Clara? Clara, do you even know who this man is? He's probably just taking shelter from the storm. He's nothing to be afraid of, Wallis. - Jamie! - [Wallis] Will! [Clara] Thomas! Thomas! Jamie? [somber music] [Will] Jamie? Jamie? Jamie! What in God's name were you thinking, Clara? - [man] Thomas! - [man 2] Jamie! How could you not tell me about this? [woman over radio] Unit family two, unit family two. Found matching the description of Jamie Caldwell has been located, currently en route to Savannah General. - Oh my God. - [man] They found him! - Let's go, boys! - [tense music] [doctor] He's got fractures in both forearms. My guess is these are defensive wounds and he was trying to protect himself like this. Now, he's got a skull fracture and a small subdural hematoma, but there's no major intercerebral hemorrhage. - So he's lucky. - Oh, lucky! [monitor beeping] [woman over PA] Doctor Swan to obstetrics. Doctor Swan to obstetrics. [Wallis] Jamie? Over there, thank you. [woman over PA] Doctor [indistinct] line three. Hi, excuse me, Doctor [indistinct]? [Professor] Yes. - Yes. - John Crane, Savannah Police Department. I have some information regarding your son. Do you have a moment? Okay, now. Hey, now this tape is from the officer that found your son. He had one of those video cameras up on top of his dash. It was recorded over on Blaylock Road. [officer on tape] Just put the boy on the ground, right now! [Crane] You get them to lie down. That's just a regular procedure there, and holster his gun. Okay, now, here's where everything gets a little strange. He picks up your son, starts to walk back to the car. At one point he blocks the camera's view of the suspect, see right there, right there, he's blocked. He's completely blocked right there. Okay, now the officer steps out of the way, the suspect is gone. And at this point, we haven't been able to locate him. Detective, you keep referring to him as the suspect. What exactly do you suspect him of doing? Attempted kidnapping, Ms. Collier. Oh, that's ridiculous. My goodness, he would never do that! How can you say that, Clara? You have known him how long, a week? Well, I have known him long enough to know that he would never hurt Jamie. That's his friend. Now I believe you might have been fooled, Ms. Collier. Thomas Jay Moore, convicted of assault, 1994. Incarcerated Reedsville State Prison. Two years. [tense music] [birds singing] [Clara whispers] Thomas. [door creaking] Thomas? - [tin rattling] - [Clara gasps] - [tense music] - [footsteps approaching] Oh, Detective, you scared me. Oh, was it me? Or the thought that I might be Thomas? You know, Ms. Collier, you really shouldn't be here, especially by yourself. I know, I just wanted to look around. Well, sometimes you just can't make sense of it. Can I give you a ride home? No. No, I'll be just fine. Thank you, Detective, goodbye. Ms. Collier? Until we get this fella, I think you really ought to be more careful. [Clara] Thomas? Thomas? - [tense music] - [Clara gasps] Shh, shh! What are you doing? What? What? No, you stay there. Thomas, I think you should go and turn yourself in. Come on. You're gonna make it worse than it already is. Thomas, Thomas, talk to them. Why not? Why not? Thomas, Thomas! - [dramatic music] - [dogs barking] - [man] Nothing here! - [man 2] Over there, signs of life over there. - [man] Thomas! - [dogs barking] [man 2] Thomas, we need you to come out! [dogs barking] [man 3] There's a pathway down here. Come on. [dogs barking] [officers shouting indistinctly] [man] Hey, get that light over here for a sec, would you? Thomas! - [man 2] There he is! - [man 3] Freeze! Get on your knees! Put your hands behind your head! [dramatic music] [man 3] Down on your belly. Hurry up and keep your hands still. [dogs barking] - [officer] Sir. - [Professor] Yeah? [officer] We found Thomas. He's been arrested and taken to the station for questioning. [Professor] Thank goodness you got him. [officer] He tried to escape, but we tracked him down. - [Professor] Thank you officer. - [officer] Good night. [Professor] Good night. They've got him in custody. You did the right thing, honey. Celia put her hands on the tree and said, "Please, Mister Tree, please don't let them find me." So then, the wishing tree made her wish come true. So by the time the mean men got there, she was gone. She went up to New York and lived happily ever after. The end. [monitor beeping] - Hey, Clara! - Hey, little girl. That was a good story you told. Clara. Thank you. - Clara? - Mm? Is Magic Man in trouble? Yes, sweetie, he is. But you're a lawyer. You can get him out of it, right? He didn't do it, Clara. He would never hurt Jamie. [somber music] [bird screeching] [tense music] [bird screeching] [bird screeching] Hello. Excuse me? Officer, I'm here to see Thomas Moore. [door shuts] Hey, Thomas. Are they treating you okay? Jamie is still in the hospital. He hasn't regained consciousness. Thomas, why aren't you talking to anyone? Well, why don't you tell them what happened? [Thomas banging on table] Okay. If you would tell them what happened-- Tell-- [tense music] [Crane] Oh, Ms. Collier. Now what brings you down to the station here? I came to see my client. Wait, wait a second. You tell me you're representing that man? Yes, I am. [Wallis sobbing] [Clara] I need to talk to you. We just got the call. I don't understand how you can do this to me, Clara. Let me explain. No, I don't want an explanation. Nothing you're gonna say could make me understand. - We don't know what happened. - What happened? What happened? Jamie went into the woods to visit that man and now he's not waking up. He's not waking up. [Wallis crying] [Wallis] Oh God. [breathing heavily] Oh God. You just-- Get out. Just get out! [Wallis crying] [Wallis] Get out of my house! [solemn music] [dog barking] [dog barking] [bell ringing] - [man] Can I help you? - Yes. I was hoping to find Ray Little. He worked here as a pharmacist in '94. Yeah, he was. But he moved back up north. Maybe I can help you. Well, I'm looking for information about a robbery that took place here. A man named Thomas Moore was involved. I think I'm the one you should talk to. Please, Mister Wishing Tree, make my friend Jamie wake up. [eerie music] [tense music] [Wallis singing indistinctly] [bell tolling] [officer] You got five minutes. [door shuts] Hello, Thomas. Are you okay? It's all right. I found out what happened at the pharmacy. I understand what you're going through, and I promise you, I'll get you out of here, but you have to help me. I need you to tell me exactly what happened. [tense music] Oh. It's okay. [breathing rapidly] It's okay. [birds singing] [Wallis] Will? [indistinct chattering] [gavel banging] [judge] Mr. Moore, you are charged with kidnapping, which is a felony in the state of Georgia. The purpose of this hearing is not to determine whether you are guilty or not guilty of these charges. It is simply to determine whether there is probable cause to bind this case over to the district attorney's office for further investigation. If I find there is no probable cause, you will be released today. Do you have any questions about what I have explained to you? No, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed. Officer Daniels, would you tell us what happened after you placed the victim in your car? Well, when I turned back towards the suspect, he was gone. You mean he ran away? [Daniels] I didn't see him. Well yeah, I suppose he did. [Clara] Officer Daniels, why was your gun drawn when you stepped from the car? [Daniels] There was an APB out on a possible kidnapping. I assumed the suspect was dangerous. He didn't answer my questions. [Clara] Do you think there's any possibility that my client could have feared for his life? I'm a police officer, counselor. And what, your bullets don't hurt? Ms. Collier. No further questions, Your Honor. [Clara] Mr. Davies, would you describe him as a violent man? [Davies] Oh no, quite the opposite in fact. [Clara] Did he ever talk to you? [Davies] No, ma'am. Thomas was born without vocal chords. But you are the head pharmacist at the very store where Thomas supposedly committed a violent robbery. Yes, but that's not really what happened. Oh? Well, would you tell us all what really did happen? [Davies] Yes. Thomas's mother was diagnosed with bone cancer in 1987. Within a few months, the illness had taken just about every penny they had. She was in so much pain, Thomas just couldn't bear it. He came to the pharmacy to get something to help her. Now, if I'd been there, I would just have given it to him. I knew he didn't have any money. But I'd just hired this new fella, Ray, and he didn't understand. When he wouldn't give Thomas the medication, he grabbed for it and accidentally, he broke Ray's hand. But you pressed charges? [Davies] No, I didn't, I had the robbery charge dropped, but that fella, Ray, went ahead with the assault charge on account of his hand being broke. So, Thomas went to jail? [Davies] Yes, he did. And that's when it happened. [Clara] What happened? [Davies] His mother passed away. I know that was hard on Thomas, not being there when she died. After he got out, he moved to the woods. Pretty much stopped coming around. To tell you the truth, I can't say I blame him. [Clara] Detective Crane, did you ever find any evidence that a crime was committed by my client? [Crane] Well, I find it hard to believe that Jamie Caldwell beat up on himself, counselor. Are you aware that my client was found carrying Jamie Caldwell less than four tenths of a mile from the Savannah General Hospital? [clears throat] No, I wasn't. Did it ever occur to you that he might be trying to help Jamie Caldwell? Well, I find that hard to believe. Why is that? Well, one thing experience has taught me is that, innocent people don't run from the law. [phone ringing] You need to understand something. If the judge thinks that there's even the slightest possibility that a crime was committed, you will be bound over for trial. And if that happens, you will remain in jail until that trial date. Thomas, you can't do this to me. I am doing everything I can to help you, but you have to help me. Listen, I don't know what went on out in those woods, but I know that whatever it was, it was not your fault. I know that, but they don't. Only you can tell them that! Your Honor, the defense calls Thomas Moore. Mr. Moore, please place your right hand on the Bible. Raise your left hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? You may sit down. Mr. Moore, I only have a few questions. Are you acquainted with a young boy by the name of Jamie Caldwell? Thomas, look at me. Are you acquainted with Jamie Caldwell? [interpreter] Yes. How would you describe your relationship? He's my friend. So, you care very deeply for him, don't you? [interpreter] Yes. Tell me, Mr. Moore. Were you invited on August fourth to a party at the home of the Albert Brooks's? Yes. And did you go to that party? No. [Clara] Why not? - [interpreter] I was afraid. - You were afraid? But why were you afraid to go to a party? [interpreter] Look at me. Look at how everyone looks at me. I was afraid of being judged. They don't understand me. It hurts too much. Does that make you angry, Thomas? [interpreter] No, makes me very sad. Thomas, did you know that your friend, Jamie Caldwell, ran into the woods to look for you, because he wanted you to come to that party? [interpreter] No, not until I heard him calling me. [dramatic music] Magic Man! - [thunder cracking] - [Jamie] Magic Man! Magic Man! [thunder cracking] [Jamie screaming] [music continues] [exhaling dramatically] - [tires screech] - [siren wails] [Daniels] Stop right where you are. Just put the boy on the ground, right now. Put the boy on the ground! Do it! I was trying, trying to help him, but I failed, I failed again. I'm so sorry. More sorry than you will ever know. You didn't fail, Thomas. We failed you. You see, a lot of times, we don't understand people who are unlike us. And rather than trying to understand, we simply reject them. I don't know what we are so afraid of. Perhaps we fear that through association, we too might be judged. We hear you, Thomas. You didn't fail your mother, and you didn't fail your friend, Jamie Caldwell. Looking at the facts of this case, I have come to the conclusion that we should not be here, judging Thomas Moore. We should be apologizing. I find no probable cause. - [gavel bangs] - Case dismissed. Yeah. [gentle music] Good job. It's Jamie, he wants to see Jamie. - Come. - I can't thank you enough for coming. [indistinct chattering] [gentle piano music] [woman speaking indistinctly over PA] Magic Man! [solemn music] [music continues] [Professor] Now magic can sometimes take a little while to work. In this case, it was about two hours after Magic Man left that Jamie finally opened his eyes. I think it's because I found the wishing tree. Well, if you found it, then how come you don't show it to us? Because I forgot to mark it. [Professor chuckles] [Clara laughs] I thought you said we weren't going far. [gentle music] We're here. The tree? Yeah, it is, it's very big. It must be over several hundred years old. [music continues] What are you doing? [mysterious music] What is that? A bullet? No. Why would anybody go shoot up a tree? You think? The wishing tree. [music continues] What, you want me to make a wish? [gentle music] - [man] Clara? - Mm? This just arrived for you. What is it? There's no return address. - Wait. - What? What if it's a bomb? Oh, Kevin, please. Who's gonna send me a bomb? Well, Clara, you're a lawyer. You want a list? Oh, oh! Who is that? That's my mother. He knew my mother. [gentle music] [Clara] As I looked at that beautiful carving, I realized I finally understood, that Thomas in many ways was like the man my mother used to talk about, the one who lived out in the woods. You see, when I got lost, he brought me back home. And that is where this story ends. [Alexa] Wait a second. What you wish for at the tree? [child] Yeah. Oh, what do you think I wished for? [Alexa] I don't know. What did you wish for? What do you think I wished for? You wished you could go back in the forest? [Jamie] I think you wished that you could be magic, like Magic Man. Jamie, you wouldn't need magic if you're friends with Magic Man. - [child] That's right. - I think I'd wish I could fly. [child] Yeah, so would I. Know what I'd wish for? I'd wish your mother could see you now. Well, I'm not gonna tell you what I wished for, but it did come true. [gentle music] And with or without the wishing tree, if you believe, yours will too. Cherish it. [bright music]
