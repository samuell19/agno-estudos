Sole. Sole... Popo. Popo! Sh! Oh. Trying to make things better. - He never listens. - Ah, I almost got it. Come plant it yourself. Sorry, sorry. Sorry, wrong note. Sole, are you guys not going? Hurry up! Uh... Uh, Popo... - Mm. - Ah. Mm. Yeah. Why should we pick you to become a seasonal worker? I'm a heavy lifter. I'm from a poor family. Just wanna be a rich family. You don't know this about me, but, uh, I'm a really good guy. Go to church every Sunday, Saturday. You know, every day. Cos I'm strong and handsome. I come bearing gifts. That's for you. Just gonna leave that there. How's your English? Come on, mate, mate, mate. How's my English?! You can't hear my English? Are you married or have children? Never in my life. Single, just mingle. No, I'm not married... any more. - Do you do drugs? - Panadol, yeah. Drugs, no. - No. - No. No? Will you do drugs? Ah, sorry, sir. I don't have a truck. I only have a bike, drive around town. When the sun get up, I'm up. When the sun go down, I don't go down; I stay up. I'm an honest person, and I love my family. New Zealand can be dangerous, and I'm wiling to do what it takes to look after my people. Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Sig-tah! Hi-yah! When the season is finished, will you come back to Samoa? Yeah. Build a new house, make a business. Do the work, eh, to take it back to Samoa. You guys gonna call me? Y- Nuh-It's OK. Thank you for sending me back to New Zealand. - Oi, don't forget your money. - Oh, it's not mine. Sure my one was green, but... Hi-yah! Hut-zah! Hut-zah! Nah, jokes. 'Dear, Popo, congratulations...' Yeah! 'Dear Alama, congratulations. 'You've been accepted in our sch-' Sole... Lama, we're going to New Zealand! We're going to New Zealand! We're going! Whoo! Samoa Airways flight OL71 bound for Auckland is now officially closed. Thank you. Bob Titilo, private investigator. Don't worry. I will find him. OK, have a good night. - Not on my watch. - What watch? He can't even afford one. Grey Goose. Alfriston. You're coming with me. Your presence has been requested. Is your name Alfriston? My dad's name. Don't worry. I got this, boys. Ss. Why'd you say my name? See, this is what I hate, man. People come looking for me, saying my full name like that. It's Alf, aiit? Suck it in, big fulla. Boys, remember that sleeper I was talkin' about? Nice and gentle around the neck, right? And just squeeze. Just squeeze. There you go. Ha, ha! I got you right where I wanted you. Right here. Sole! Uh, boys! Boys! Let's gap it! Room for improvement. Mm. Oh, another five minutes won't hurt. Lama. Lama. Lama! Ooh! The Sky Tower. Whoa! Wow! Yeah, we just can't find enough people locally. I mean, there's more work than there is interest. So being able to fly in workers as and when we need means that we can keep operating profitably and without any long-term strain on the infrastructure. And how do you keep these workers motivated? Oh, they're self-motivated. If a worker breaks the rules, decides to depart without permission, that's gonna have consequences for their families. You see, most of the workers in this group, they're earning their money for a year. Is it all right if we go and talk to them? Yeah, sure. - Hey, Popo! - Sole. I just wanted to grab a few words. Uh, you want me to look into your eyes? Just be natural. This is my natural. OK. Uh, Popo, can you just tell me what you get from coming to New Zealand and picking fruit? Uh, yeah. I... get the... I get the money. Hm. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Yep. Thank you. Probably... Can we grab another one? Yeah. - Hey, uh, Alama! - Lama. So, what sorts of things do you buy? Um, things for the kids, for their school. And maybe a fridge and a car to help my dad with the plantation. And I wanna say thank you to Sir Tony for the opportunity and, uh, wish I'll come back and work here again. - Fa'afetai lava. - Thank you. Yeah, really nice. Thank you. We got a good one here. If you were a kiwi fruit, I would pick you. Th-Thank you. - Yeah. Fa. - See you later. Marry me for your visa! Popo. Popo? Popo! Popo? Popo?! If you're gonna make your plane, you're gonna have to go now. I'm not gonna go back home with nothing. But we'll do everything we can to find him and your money. But even if you find him, you won't be able to get the money off him. You don't know New Zealand. How you going to find him? Hello. I think it's a New Zealand number. Hello. Oh, Alama! Let's not waste time. Let's get a professional. And who's gonna pay for it? Well, my son can help. He's a private investigator. And he can start now. Bob! Bob, why are you the furniture? Uncle, I'm trying to practise my private investigation skills. You know, like my stealth movement. Never mind. What skill? - Thanks, Mum. - Don't touch. Look at you! Go and put those clothes I've got on your bed for you to wear, son. - Mum. - Don't just stand there. Go do as you're told. I'm 40, Mum. I know what I'm doing. Do you really? Son! Don't stand there. You're running late. - Yeah. - Come on. Thanks, Mum. - And, son... - Yeah. Please stay away from... - Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK. - All right. - Love you, Mum. - Love you too. - You have a nice day. - K. Everyday Samoan language, volume one. When you meet someone, you can ask them... Tony Green. Bob Titilo, private investigator. Yeah, Alama said you'd be coming. It's incredibly unfortunate, what happened. Oh, the audacity is off the Richter! Ah. Oh, look, here's Alama. - Talofa lava. - Oh, talofa lava. Thank you so much for coming. And I'm really sorry for this burden. Oh, look, it's no problem. I'm sure I'll have everything wrapped up by tomorrow. Oh, cool. Now, this Popo, he's related to... to you? He's my brother. Not by blood - I'm adopted - but we were raised together. So are you sure he took the money? Oh, yes, very sure. How do you know? He's the only one not going back to the island. And he's been acting strange. I... I think he's been planning this for a while. Why did you have the money in cash? - I was going to buy something. - Like what? Just things for my family back in the island. OK. Tony, is it OK if we check the accommodation? - Yeah, sure. - Thanks, mate. - Right this way, sir. - Yep. And we'll check in here first. Need to look for some evidence. Just what I thought. I'm bagging it for evidence. What about this? What's 'evidence' in Samoan? That's not evitesei. - Evelegi. - Evelantage. Oh, here. Please, Alama, try not to help. Cos you're really not, OK? - Which one is Popo's bed? - It's this one. - These must be Popo's. - Yeah. Evidence. Tony, may I dust for fingerprints? Whatever you need, Bob. - Do you need help? - No. There's special training. Just what I thought. Can I ask you - why are we doing this? Because I have to get into Popo's mind. Who am I? How am I? Which am I? What am I? Before I know - where am I. Is that him?! - That's a tree. - Exactly. You see, we have to know where he isn't... in order to know where he is. Wow. Look at the wingspan of those toes. You can definitely tell those are Samoan footprints. Alama, lavalava. If I was Popo... If I am Popo... I would've gone... that way. Tony, thanks for your help, mate. - I'll take it from here. - OK, mate. Alama, we're gonna go on a forest walk. I hope you're ready. My body's conditioned for it. Do you really think Popo came through this way? If I was Popo, I'd be avoiding all the main roads. Do you recognise that man? No. But that's my lavalava. OK. Leave the talking to me. Hey, mate. How's it going? - Talofa. - Talofa lava. - I am Alama. - Bob Titilo. - I'm Gareth. - Oh, Gazza! Gazza, we're looking for a Samoan b- Popo. He gave me his lavalava, so I gave him a discount on a ride. Where to? Just a loop around the forest track in a 4-wheel drive. - Are you two keen? - Yes. We need to go through what he went through. Selfie time! So people pay for a bumpy ride? Yeah. Something different, eh? Any idea where he went to after this? Uh, yeah. He wanted to go riding. - Horsey. - Why am I doing this? Because we need to get into his head. Why did Popo ride a horse? What can the horse tell us? Where did Popo go? Was it the TAB? Did he try and eat you? Are you sure you don't wanna ride? Uh, do you wanna broke-back horse? So what's the horse saying, then? The horse is saying... mountain. - Horse guide lady. - My name's Sharon. Shazza! Is there a mountain nearby? Yeah. There's one just out that way. Is there a smaller mountain? Preferably one that's flat. Look. You see these dents on the ground? Nordic. What's a Nordic? Shh. Nordic. One in this hand, one in the other hand... Yeah. Alama, hurry up. We're getting nowhere. You sure Popo came through this way? Yes. The horse wouldn't lie to me. Whoa, that is so beautiful. - It's a nice view up here. - Yeah. That was way chill a walk than I thought. Yeah. Are you all right? Looks like you need some hydration. Thank you. So, where are you guys from? I'm from Samoa. Samoa? That is definitely on my list of places I wanna visit. Oh, yes, please. Where you from? I'm English. But my dad's Scottish and my mum's Irish, so. Irish? I'm Irish too. Really? Yeah. 'Irish' you're my girlfriend. That's cute. Yeah. And why would Popo be coming up here? Nordic poles. Easy for walking. See you. - I'm Bob. - Kelly. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, especially in a setting that's almost as beautiful as you. May I ask you a question? Uh, OK. You know, we've just finished a five-hour trek. - Two hours? - Yep, two-hour trek. What would you do next? Uh... Well, we'll probably grab a cold one. Oh, an ice block? - Where from? - There's a place close by. Oh, nice. Hi, how are you? How's it going? Can I speak with your manager, please? Free drinks for anyone that can beat me. So you're the manager. I could be. I got a few questions I need to ask you. - You police? - No. But I'm looking for a Samoan man, mid-20s, not local. But he looks like this. It'll cost you. How much? 500. That's a little bit over my budget. No deal. What... if I... could beat... you? You think... that you... can beat... me? - I've got something better. - Oh? OK. Yeah, I got this, I got this. - Right, boss. - Yeah. - I'm the boss. - Let's do this! - Let's do this. - Shirts off! Oh. Oh my gosh. It's when you took your shirt off. Uh... Uh... We'll cross that bridge when we get to the... bridge. - Popo's in there? - Yes. We're getting closer. How we gonna find him in all of that? How do you find a needle in a haystack? You eat the hay. So simple. What we gonna do now? We need to get into his head. Not this again. If you had money and a pretty girl, what would you do? Marry the girl and use the money for the wedding. No. You'd go into town, you'd have a great time, and because you got money, you'd get yourself a hotel room. You wake up in the morning, you're staring in the horizon; You look at the biggest tree in the concrete jungle and you think to yourself, 'I want to climb that!' Uh, chicken. I wasn't happy with those goats we got last time. - Really? - Well, who wants diabetic goats at a party? It's not ideal. I'd like those goats that eat gorse, cos it's a real problem at the moment. - Did you get that? - Yeah, I got it. I just can't spell it. And chicken. Alama, I'll go left. You go right. Look at how high we are. You go left. We'll both go left. Oh, OK. Keep your eyes and ears peeled. We need to surround him. Alama, he's not up here. Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah! Ah-hoo-hoo! Whoo! Ah-hoo-hoo! Yeah! Ohh! Man, it was amazing. I bet it was. I mean, that high! - There's my dawn warrior. - Oh, and there's the other one! That was awesome, man! So this is what Popo's been doing with your money. I see everything from there. I can see the tree. - It's beautiful just like you. - Oh, really? Oh my gosh. Alama, get him! Aah! My hamstrings! Right behind you, Alama! Ss! Ss! Ssah! - Bob! - Just around the corner! You're not allowed to run up hills! Sole! Mate, I'm in a high-speed pursuit and I'm gonna need your transportation. Can I use it? - Yeah. - Thanks, man. Where's the rest of your bike, man? - Right here. - Oh mate. That's right. Strong core. That's it. That's it. Yeah, I remember. It's all coming back. Oh. Something wrong with the... Once you put your bike together, then I'll be back. - Thanks mate. - All right. Good luck. Bob Titilo has done it again! Come on. Hurry up! Alama, he's getting away. Come on, driver, let's go. High speed. Hey, Popo, this is my town. Get him, get him! Go on, go on! Let's go! Let's go! Come on, this is a high-speed chase. Yeah! Whoo! - Gonna get you, Popo! - This is what you call real! Gonna get you, Popo! This way, this way, this way! Popo, stop. Just stop. Stop. - He's not stopping. - Tackle him. It's a moving vehicle. It's too dangerous. Driver, driver, please stop. Please stop here, please. Get him. Get him! - Thank you. - You're welcome. It's 20 bucks. - Huh? - 20 bucks. 2... 2... Uh... Sole, you, um... You found me. Well done. Oh! Popo? No. No, no. Just let him go. - Let him go. - What? No, just let him go. Let him go. Yeah. Thanks, Alama. Next time just leave him to me. Don't try to take him. I know what to expect. I've got a few surprises myself. Look, we found him once. We can find him again. And how are we gonna do that? Here. - Why would he do that? - Exactly. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Yeah, good, thank you. - How are you? - Yeah, good. Take a seat. Wow. Welcome to wine tasting for beginners. It's your first step towards expanding your knowledge and appreciation for wine. Boy, do we have a treat in store for you tonight. What wine do you have for a man who have no money in his wallet but a lot of love in his heart. Samoan man, mid to late 20s, sampled any wine lately? Um, yeah, actually, in the previous session. He was a very generous tipper. - Where did he go to next? - Well, it's Saturday night, so I'm guessing the club up the road. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You're not gonna have a taste? Uh... Just a little bit. - Stay away. - Don't do it. This isn't you, Bob Titilo. You know, I would've been in the Warriors. Could've been in the police force, a navy SEAL. Could've been a commander in the army. Could've been the first Samoan man on the moon. - Really? - Prime minister of New Zealand. What are you talking about? Could've been a nutritionalist. Could've ran a two-mile marathon. I coulda had a three-pack abs. Could've swam the Cook Strait on the ferry. Are you from, like, around here? I'm from Samoa. Samoa? Oh my goodness, that's the most beautiful place. Could've done so much. Oh, yes! We are looking for my brother. - Well, I hope you find him. - Yeah. Hey, um, where did your friend go? Bob? Bob! You can't catch me! Hey! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Phwoar! It's been a long time. Hi, tree. Ohh! I am Bob Chichilo. Hey, Popo. Oh, that's not Popo. Excuse me, have you seen Popo? He's about this tall. He's like that. Very naughty. Naughty boy! Oh, I can feel it. Whoa! Oh! Whoo-hoo! I am Aquaman! No more fishing for you. Hey! What...? Are you talking to me? Hey! You-You wanna piece of this? You want a piece of this? Hey? Come on. I'm gonna give you a real jab in your face. I'm been training. Training really hard. Yeah. You see that upper cut? Coming your way. I am Bob Titilo, private investigator. There's no way... There's no way you can take me over! Oh my God! Elbow, wrist-bow, finger-bow, knee-bow. You are gonna bow down to me. You want me to smash this on your head? Huh? Ha, you can't fool me. Aahh! You think that hurt? No, it was painful. - All right, all right. - Stop it! Stop it, Alama! It's not worth it. You'll just get hurt. You can't contain me. Stop trying to be a container. Wait! OK! - OK? - OK, yeah. - Calm down. - I'm good. Look... Yaaah! Stop it, Alama. Get away. - That's enough. - Get away! Wha...? What's wrong with you? I'm sorry, Alama. Every Superman has his kryptonite. What is kryptonite? It's a... You don't understand. This is a waste of time. You're supposed to be helping me. I am! I am, I promise. - I'll help you. - Forget it. Hey. Where you going? - Let go. - Let go or what? I'm trying to make you see the errors of your ways. - Just step away. - Or else what? You think you can take me? You think you can take Bob Titilo? - Yes, I do. - Hey? Here, take this. Aahh! Right where I want you. Enough. I got styles too. I got snake. I got a horse. I got a elephant. Two trunks. Eh? And I got a banana style. You know what I can do with that? I can peel your face. Aahh! You don't listen. Uh? What you gonna do with no money? Huh? You don't even know where you're going. Every time you try something, you stuff it up. I saw an opportunity and evaluated the situation and acted accordingly. Big words doesn't make you less wrong. That's it! We're finished! You can go back to the islands the same way you came - broke! Can you not bring your dramas around here? Yeah, cos you're kind of killing our vibe. Well, can you not bring your faces in public? Cos your kind of killing my eyes. That guy doesn't look too good. We should check him. - No, he's fine. - Oh, sorry. Sorry. Are you OK? Do you need help? No. No, I'm fine. I mean yes. Are you hurt? Oh! Actually, I'm in a lot of pain. Are you sure? Cos if you're lying, I'm gonna hurt you for real. I think we should take him to hospital. No, he needs some physical and psychological healing. And I know what he needs. It's always the ones closest to you, eh? What would you do if you don't get your money back? Well, I'll go back home with nothing. - Here, take this. - Oh, no, no, no, no. It's not much. Take it. Hopefully it will help. $2. We got to go. We're gonna be late for church. Here. - Fa'afetai lava. - Look after yourself. Let's go. - Fa. - Fa soifua. So you're just going to leave it? Yes. Mum, I can't work in an environment where I'm not appreciated. Why is Alama so desperate to get his money back? - I don't know. - How much was stolen? Mum, I didn't ask. Why would he want to overstay his visa? Mum, I don't even think it's relevant. Oh! Son, you're a crap investigator. You're 40, unemployed and still living at home. Yeah, but it's a nice home, Mum. How many times have I told you to stay away from-? Wow, wow. Thanks, Mum, for the vote of confidence? Now, you listen and listen carefully, son. If you don't show respect for Alama, you are no better off than the guy that took his money. You finish what you started. Do you hear me? Yeah, but, Mum, he's probably long gone by now. - Based on what information? - I'm just assuming. Popo. He's my brother, not by blood. He's been acting strange. There's my dawn warrior! Very generous tipper. He gave me his lavalava, so I gave him a discount. That's cute. Ko'a lua. Beautiful just like you. There's my dawn warrior. There's my dawn warrior! There's my dawn warrior! Dawn warrior! Yes. Gotcha! Don't you take him on by yourself. You go and look for Alama and take him- No, Mum. I'm gonna look for someone else. Go look for Alama. The giraffe wakes up. Open up your bones! Open up the cartilage. Open up the ligaments! Build a bridge for the people. Breathe in. Sole! Hey! Tell the people it's safe to cross. You're... I'm Bob... Faitatala. Faiamio? Fai... Bob Fa... Bob... - Bob Titilo! - Titilo! Oh, I see what you did. Oh, you brought the power, huh? OK, well, uso, you might have the power, but I've got the speed. Oh, come on! Hey, Popo, where's your speed now, mate? Oh! Oh, you beauty. A getaway vehicle. Let's go. Yeah! Whoo-hoo! I knew we'll get the money back. What? He's got the bag! Go faster! I beg your pardon? - Plan B, then. - What's plan A? Feel the rhythm. Feel the vibe! Plan B! Yes! How do you like that Bob Titilo special, eh, Popo? You... Hey! Ks! Ks! Ks! Aaah! Ks! Ks! Ks! Ks! Hey, that's my bike! - Hey! - Don't worry about it. - I'll buy you a new bike. - I need it for work tomorrow. - What do you do for work? - Riding! Excuse me! That's my bike! Hello! Hey! That's my bike! Sole! I found Popo. Did you get the money? No. He got away again. Popo and I always dream of coming here. I like it here too. But if we are both here, then there's nobody back home. Yeah, but you can always send money back home to help. Money pay for things, but it doesn't stop your parents from being lonely. It doesn't remind them to take their medicine, or even tell jokes just to make them laugh. Popo doesn't get that in his head. I'm sorry. What was that? I'm slowly getting a cough. Alama, I'm really sorry. Sorry for everything. Ah, it's all right. Thank you for helping me. You're the only one who came out and helped me. Thanks for... being a friend. Like... best friends? Nah, friends. One more step and then best friends, eh? - 12 steps. - 12 steps? You know what? We're gonna get that money. But this time we're gonna do it together. Like a team! Like usos. Yeah! Feel like an idiot. Yeah, we'll do it together. Best friends! Nearly best friends. So how are we gonna find him now? We can't do it by ourselves. Today I'm going to teach you how to do the lima tau. - Limatow. - Li-ma tau. - Leematayau. - Tau. Tau. - Tayow. - Tau. Tau. - Haua. - Tau. Samoan martial art. OK, if someone's attack you... - Yeah. - Show me how you block. Raah! - Wow. What is that? - Well, did you hit my face? - No. - Then that's a block. Bro, is this you? No! Isn't this your man? What? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - Whoa! Got it. - This one you're gonna block. - Yeah. - This one is for the slap. - Ohh! - You see? - Of course, of course. And the same time with both of them. - Yes, yes, I know. - You ready? Go. No. Ready. No. No. No. No. Hoo-ahh! No. No. How many fingers am I holding up? - Two. - Whoaaa! Ohh! See? Aah! Yo! Yo! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, real Fa'asamoa! Can you do that softer? Blockslap. Blockslaaaap! Raaah! Yaaah! I think I make you worse than before. Better if you just stick to what you're good at. - OK. - What are you good at? Let me show you my skill of how to stay hidden. Can you see me behind the chair? Ha, ha! I was behind the tree. Nice try. I said to the Australian, 'You're a platypus!' A platypus! Now, that's what you call a platypus. They found him. I've got an address. Come on, Alama. Popo! Check over there. Popo! Popo! Can you hear anything? No. There! Watch out. Popo! You go first. Lucky I came prepared. Alama. Alama? Um... Can't trust my eyes. Gonna have to use my ears. Alama? Are you there? Oh! Alama, are you there? Wow, what a skux dude. Bob. Oh my gosh. - Why are your eyes closed? - Because I was trying to... - Come on, hurry up. - OK, yeah. Let's check upstairs. No, I don't think he's gone upstairs. I'm sure he's staying on flat surfaces now. He's got to be here somewhere. There. Enough mucking around, Popo. Lama. Why the rush for? Lama... I'm not going back. This is not our home, Popo. If that's our home, Lama, then why hasn't anybody else gone back? All we do is work for them. It's the same thing over and over again. If you want it, then... come and get it. There. Oof! Look, it says, 'Lama, come get me! 'I'm waiting for you.' Let's go, Lama. Show me the stupid moves our dad showed you. OK. Go home, Lama. Sau. I am not going back. What the...? - It's you! - Yes, me. - Alama, you've got this. - No. We got this. Together. - Best friends? - Nearly best friends. Now get him! You all right? Alama. You've got him. Hey! Get him! Yeah. - How's that feel now? - That's enough, Popo! That's enough, Popo. I said enough, Popo. That's two enoughs. I knew you'd get him, Alama. Both of us did it together. That's what happens when you mess with best friends, Popo. Hey, best friend. Guess what I got for you. What's he laughing about, Alama? I spent it on good times. It's just like our family. All that work for nothing! Alama, I've still got some oranges left. Popo... Yeah. Sorry, Mum. Stuck together. Sorry, Alama, we couldn't get your money back. That's all right. It's not your fault. Here's something to take back to Samoa. Thank you, man. Well, you better practise those moves, huh? Every day. Take care, huh? - Fa, Alama. - Fa soifua. Fa, Bob. - Fa, Alama. - Fa. Shit. Huh? Hey! Bob Titilo. Heeeey! What a useless boys! I living the high life! A new Hilux! New hat, new watch. Hoo! Yeah. Sorry, Lama. Yep, cool. Heyyy! Whooo-hoo-hoo!

Girls, I love you too! Thank you very much. Popo. Hello, Bob. - Sole! - Hey! Alama! Hey, Popo! Malo soifua, Bob. Hey, look. Check this. Got the electric motor for it. Is that the right size? Yeah, that's the right one. And it should get there by next week. Oh, cool. You been practising your moves? Oh yeah. Every day, mate. Every day. You wanna see what I got? Ooh!

I'm taking you to your mother. Take me to jail! Take me to jail! It's David's birthday. We're having some fun, couple of drinks. - Uso, just a couple ones. - Just relax. Relax. And now I'm hyperventilating. I don't know how youse fit in that car. Such a small car. I love you. I'm sorry, I love you, Mum. I I-Aaah! Chee-hoo!
