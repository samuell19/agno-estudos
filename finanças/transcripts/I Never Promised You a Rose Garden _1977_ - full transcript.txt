- It's pretty. - Yes. All those trees. Should I help her out? I don't think so. Deborah? Deborah? Mr. and Mrs. Blake? Yes. We're here to see Dr. Fried. Yes, if you'll just take a seat for a minute, please. Thank you. Dr. Fried. Dr. Fried, the Blakes are here. Very good. They're waiting in reception. Doctors have ethics. Of course. If they find it's a mistake, I'll stay home right away. Of course they will. Just can't seem to reason for it. We've been through this so many times. I thought... Mr. and Mrs. Blake? Dr. Fried will see you now. I'll be back for Deborah in a minute. Follow me, please. We're going through the garden. Do you work with Dr. Fried? No, I'm a student nurse. There's a whole group of us training here. Can I get you anything, Deborah? A cup of coffee? A Coke? Oh, suffer now, victim. But remember now our basic law. Not a word of us to anyone. Not a word of our sacred words. Deborah? Shall we go upstairs now? Shall we go? Come on. Debbie. Very good. This way. You don't like to be touched. I'll remember that. Come along, dear. Your room's down here. That's Sarah. You'll meet each other later. Obey, but betray nothing. - Nothing, nothing... - This is your room. You're sharing it with Clara. - Carla. - Hi. I got the report from the ward doctor, Deborah. You don't have to keep calling me Deborah. - I know who I am. - I'll remember that too. You don't like to be touched, and you know who you are. Now you can go out into the grounds by yourself if you like. But you mustn't leave the premises. - Is that clear? - Clear as day. All right. Take care of that cold, Carla. Don't worry, you'll get more privileges soon. If you work hard with your doctor, they ease up a little. Does anybody ever get out of here? You mean get well and leave? Yeah. I don't know. Do you smoke? See? Not now. Okay. Okay. Pamela's going to walk you up to Dr. Fried's cottage. She's a wonderful person. Deborah... It'll be all right, sweetheart. I promise you. - Baby... - No! Mrs. Blake, Dr. Fried's waiting. Now, please, I'll call you tonight. Deborah, it's up this way. Come on. You have any hobbies, Deborah? Do you have any hobbies? Sure, didn't they tell you? Suicide. How many times have you tried to kill yourself? Once. How many times have you tried? I'll be back for you in an hour, Deborah. It's a trap, Deborah. Where's the wonderful doctor? Spying? Peephole? She'll probe into your brain. Deborah! Deborah. I am with you now and forever. Remember our prophecy. They will leave you here, leave you here with her for life. Protect yourself. Do not betray us. Protect yourself. Do not betray us. - Hello, Deborah. - Protect yourself. I'm Dr. Fried. Please, come in. Would you like some coffee? It's a very nice day. Do you want to lie down? I thought it was expected. We only expect you to get well. Hmm. I see. You ask the questions, I answer them. Then you tell me I only imagined those things. Your sickness is real. Very real. Tell me what you're thinking. Sigmund Freud. "Sigmund." You know what that means? - Mm-hmm. - "Powerful mouth." That's what he died of, you know. Cancer of the mouth. Next question. Do you know why you're here? Clumsiness is at the top of the list. And then we have lazy, self-centered, tactless, mean, obstinate, imaginary pains, fake dizziness. Also, I'm unfriendly. That's quite a list. Now, I don't know if I can agree with all of it, but if that's true, we have a lot of work to do. It's always the same. They want to make me friendly, fill me with happy lies, take away my symptoms, send me home. Then what will I have left? I don't want you to do anything against your will, or give up anything until you're ready. But I have a feeling we can work together. Would you like to try? No. Well, I'm sorry. Maybe I asked too soon. So tell me something about your life before today. Hasn't my mother told you? Yeah, she told me what she knows, but not what you know. For instance? The tumor. She knows as little about that as I know about you. What do you know about me? You read detective stories. That's true. I like that. You see... the urethra is a tube with a very delicate membrane. It extends from the bladder to the outside of the body. I know. You know, but you can't imagine the pain. How old were you? Five. The doctors all shook their heads over it. They wheeled me in the operating room, and when I asked them where I was, they said, "Dreamland." And I asked them, "Why do you keep telling me such horrible lies?" And then this one doctor said, "We're going to fix your doll up real fine. This won't hurt a bit, honey." But it felt like they were going to murder me. Dreamland. I could tell them all something about dreamland. Idiots. Stupid idiots. Will they never learn not to lie to children? No, they'll never learn. What did your mother and father say? My father brought me there without even consulting me, like I was this object to be taken apart, scrubbed and cleaned and put back together again. Anyway, I never lost that tumor. Do you believe that... that tumor could be punishment? Uparu punishes us all. "Upari"? Trait, trait, traitor, traitor. Traitor. Traitor. Traitor. Traitor. Fear nothing and they will feel only us. Feel nothing or they will feel nothing, and they will... Feel nothing or they will feel nothing, and they will feel only us, feel nothing or they will... Feel nothing or they will feel nothing, and they will feel only us. Aren't you very young to be in a place like this? This is an evil place. Are you a virgin? What is this place? Ward D. "D" for "disturbed," honey. Scared? You should be. I've been raped every night since I came here. I'm Lee. I was a nurse here. I worked on this ward. Now I'm a psychotic, like you. Hey, I heard you cut up your arm real good with that tin can. Blood all over the sheets when they found you. It is you, isn't it? It's certainly me. - How did you...? - All right. Tin Can Kid here has an important visitor, so everyone else out to the dayroom. Oh, good. If it's important, Hobbs, then I can lay my case before him. - Yeah, out. - All right, but show manners. Hobbs may work here, but he's just another fucking psychotic, honey. All right, all right, all right. Be gentle, I'm sick. Dawn. I'll be shot at dawn. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm still getting used to it! Deborah. How do you feel? This is the happiest moment in my life. Leave me alone. I don't want to leave you alone. I want to know why you did this. You're making it very difficult for both of us if you don't talk to me. I'm going to ask you again when you feel a little better. I'll see you soon. Attagirl. That's my girl. A few more feet. That's it. Right here. Attagirl. You just sit here and stare at the Tin Can Kid. I see a great move for you, kid. That's the one. Hey, Hobbs. Hobbs? You have big muscles. Big keys. How big is your tool, honey? You interested? Come on, show us your tool. Pull it out. I can assure you, it's enormous and ruthless. Stop it. You're just going to have to imagine, because you ain't ever gonna get it. I don't want it! It's got to be diseased, like your mind! Excuse me, sir, but I really must lay my case before the Supreme Court. Why don't you just lay the Supreme Court? You're not properly placed. You're not properly placed. Ignore her, honey. She's a fucking psychotic. You bother me. Get away from me. You bother me. Wherever I am, you are right in front of me. Now, remove yourself. Why do you want to see it? I want you to see it. That scar is going to stay there. Do you think you'll tell me today why you did it? I had to. Uh-huh. I'm poisonous. In what way, poisonous? Things I touch are poisoned. People I get near. Like my sister. I tried to kill her when she was a baby. Will you tell me about it? I went to the crib, and tried to throw her out the window. That's all. Wait, the window was open? No. I went to the crib first. And then I went to the window, to open it. I was just going to drop her off when my mother walked in. Did she punish you? No. No one ever mentioned it again. Six-year-old girl lifts up a heavy baby from her cradle, carries the baby to the window, open the window wider. Just when she's ready to drop her, her mother comes in. But she's not scared or frightened. Does that seem possible to you? I remember it. I think you hated her so much, you wanted to kill her. Go back into that room, look at your sister in her cradle, and think. What happened? What do you feel? Angry. And... scared. Could you lift up the baby over the bars? I didn't even touch her. Deborah. You can trust me. I won't betray you. Prove it. I can only prove it the long, hard way. Time. You must give me time. Why should I give you anything? I don't belong to you. I don't belong to anybody in this world. Where do you belong? Uri. Uri? Like weird? Frightening? Is that the name of your world? Does it have its own language? Like Upari? Can you tell me any more? You almost said one. What? Imore. Imore? What does it mean? It means "death." Don't ask me anything else. Please. Uparu! Hey! Hey! Somebody! Hey, you, what is this? Hey! Somebody! Hey! Hey! Shh. You'll wake the whole hospital. How are you feeling? Hot. I feel hot. Body heat. Under here. How long have I been in this thing? Usual: four hours. Ready to come out? Yes, please. Okay. Hobbs. Come here. She's ready to come out. Knicks, 14 points. Fourth quarter. Big deal. You and basketball. I'm golden. All right, careful. Open a vein, Hobbs. - What? - Your wrist. Am I giving you ideas? You know that yo-yo bit me? I wonder what she tasted like. Skunk, probably. All right, cut it out, Debbie. Cut it out. Oh. That's a nice scar. That's for life, you know. Yeah, just like your face. Wait outside, Hobbs. Get up? Hmm? All right, take it easy. Come on up. Think you can walk, or you want to take a cab? I can walk. All right, turn around. Now, hold on to that table. I'm going to take this wet gown off of you. So you don't catch cold. All right, just a minute. Okay, put your arms through here. Listen, I want you to lay off of Hobbs, you hear me? Why? He's sick and he knows it, and he takes it out on all of us. Yeah, well, then you ought to recognize someone else's trouble when you see it. You think you've got a corner on suffering? There you go. Hello, gorgeous. How you doing, Lee? Hey. - Nighty night. - Mm-hmm, pleasant dreams. Don't make her stand in the damn line, Hobbs. Get her sedative and have somebody put her in the bath. Milk her off, for Christ's sake! - Never mind, Helene. - Shut up. Give me Blake. - She's flipped. - Oh. Daffy Duck time. Watch yourself. Get somebody get him to sleep right away. You got it. - Hobbs... - Take a bath. Toot, toot, toot, toot! - Rape! - No, no, not rape. - Not rape. - Rape! - No, no, no. - Rape. Rape. - No, no, please... - Rape! Rape! Rape. Rape. No, no, no. Rape. - Rape. Rape. - No, no. No, no, no, not rape. It's love, not rape. - No, no, no. Shh. - Rape. All right, Mr. McPherson. Yes? You can take me anytime you want to, because I'm too tired to resist. Thank you. Thank you. Hi. When did you get here? A couple hours ago. I tried to hang myself. See? My mother shot me, and my brother, and herself. They all died, except me. I like McPherson. He treats you like a real person. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. - Hello. - It's been a heavy day. - How is Deborah? - Can you take this? I'll take care of it, Doctor. It goes up and down. Today, it's down. What happened today? That's the way it goes. Sit down. I have started to chip away at her sickness. But she has nothing yet to put in its place. She is in a kind of no-man's-land. Doctor, can you tell us what we can hope for? We give her so much love and... will she ever be able to lead a normal life? - Like other people? - Yes. I don't know. I have to find out first what kind of life she wants to lead. Well, the life we gave her wasn't so horrible. Can we see her today? I wouldn't advise it. The way she looks now might alarm you. - I want to see her. - Jay, the doctor said we can't. I want to see her. I have a right to see her. If you insist. I'll have her come down. All right... I don't want to see her. Would you give these to her? Of course. Thank you. That's nice. I have a feeling. Do you want to go along with me? Do you think I'm capable? Certainly. Your basic knowledge about yourself is sound. Believe in it. Your mother had a miscarriage when you were very small. And she went away. I feel all that warmth gone now. Cold. That feeling comes back often. And the bars of the crib... that's what happens now. When I'm waiting... waiting to fall. To fall. And every time something makes you remember the cold, and the feeling of being abandoned. That experience colors everything for you. And helps you deep inside. That's the way life is. Who needs it? That's not true. She's putting on a loving face to destroy you. Look, there'll be no eating in the hall. I don't want to see anybody eating in this hall. You take your plate and you go back to your room. You understand? Move it along, please. You're not properly placed. Move along. That's right. You're not properly placed. Boring. Boo! Dead. Like to see my picture? Dangerous. Dangerous. That's not you. It's Joan of Arc. It's me playing Joan of Arc. I loved her. Yeah? Were you an actress? Mm-hmm. Boring. Did you make any movies? Just theater. Never made Broadway. The nearest I came was Pittsburgh, for Christ's sake. Pittsburgh. What other kind of parts did you play? None of your business. Move along. That's right. Slob! Slob! All right, all right, I'm here, I'm here. All right, Helene, what happened? Deborah tried to take my lunch tray away! All right, now did anyone see what happened? I did! I did! Get her out. Everybody, out of the hall. Come on. - Filthy slob! - Come on, Helene. Everybody out in the hall. Come on, come on. I got to clean you up Come on, come on. - No! - Come on now, Deborah. Let's go, come on. Deborah. This way. Deborah! Let's talk about the time you tried to kill yourself. Your mother told me she found you sitting on the bathroom floor. And you had cut your wrist. And you were catching the flow of blood in a saucepan. Later, she asked you why you didn't just let the blood run down the sink, and you said... "So it wouldn't go too far away." Do you remember that? It seems to me that moment was a cry for help. A cry that meant, "I'm desperate. I think I'm going crazy." # I was a loser Most all of my life # # A broken boozer Boozed up in fights # # I look like a toad But I feel like a queen # # I should have had the blues But what I sing is the greens # # I never met a man Who said he'd stay # # No man would touch me Even if I paid # # So I bought myself a dog He's the man of my dreams # # I should have had the blues But what I sing is the greens # # That dog of mine He treats me so mean # # He locks me in the basement So I can't be seen # # But I'll be his dog If he'll be my man # # I should have had the blues But what I sing is the greens # Silly bitches. That was wonderful, Lee. Wasn't that nice? Boring. You know who was here this time last year, don't you? Who? Miss Coral. Silly bitch. Who is Miss Coral? Ah, she's a friend of ours. Someone who got out! This is before your time, honey. I saw her throw a bed once. She was stronger than Helene. She was not. All 90 pounds of her. Real educated too. No more than I am. That old bird taught math, geometry, trigonometry, volumetry, optometry, astronomy. You name it, she played it. Then she goes out like a bird through the fucking bars and starts teaching again! She's eating Christmas pies right now! Silly bitch. Pack that in. Damn it! Pack that in! You bitch. Get up. Oh, goddamn it, let me out of here! Time to go. Whore! The whore! Whore! You bitch! You bitch! You bitch! McPherson! Whore! Hurry up. All right, get everybody out of here. Get them back to the room. Lee! Put it down! Put it... Put it down. Get up here. I haven't seen anything like this since I was abducted from the Ritz Hotel in London. Get them out of here. Get them out of here. Come on. Fire! No! Fire! No! Fire! No! I guess we're scared. Huh? Huh? I guess we were scared talking about Miss Coral. What about her? She got well, and... and she went out. Doesn't that scare you? Huh? Goddamn you, you must be crazier than me, because it runs in your family, or what your crazy mother left of it. That was disgusting of me. You're poisoning her. You can try and hurt me if you like. Their vibrations are poisonous. Cut them off. It was true what you said about Miss Coral... Carla. # Merry Christmas to all # - I'm not ready. - I know that. But I have to take your pulse. I said I'm not ready. I said I have to take your pulse. Aah! Hmm. Relax. Relax. You're running cold, hon. Poison him. Poison Hobbs. You are poisoning... Merry Christmas to you guys. You're poisoning Hobbs. Hobbs. Hobbs. You are poisoning Hobbs. Did you tell the ward doctor about this? Yes, and he said, "Oh, really? Well, we'll have to check into this." That's what he always says when he thinks that we've imagined something. And while Hobbs was hitting Helene, what did you do? Did you cry out? No. I was scared that he'd hit me if I did, so... I'm a coward, you know. No, I don't know that. You don't think I imagined it, do you? No. Someone should look into it. But I don't run this hospital, you know? I have to write a formal complaint in cases like this. Can't you bring it up at a staff meeting or something? I will. I promise you, I will. But I can't promise end result. What can you promise? You talk to me about getting well and coming back to reality? What good is your reality if it doesn't do anything about people like Hobbs? I never promised you a rose garden. Will you bring it up at a staff meeting about Helene? Yes. I told you. But I can answer only for myself. Now you see what she really is. Deborah, now you see what she really is. Deborah, now you see... You sons of bitches! You lice! You vermin! Cockroaches! Hi, Miss Coral. Hi, you old son of a bitch! We're putting her in Seclusion 2. She'll need an injection. She can keep in her room. Aren't you a bit young to be up here? You have the right to be as crazy as anyone else. Maybe you're right. Let me go. I'll go back. Now, Miss Coral, you better calm down, or we have to strap you down. All right, now, you behave yourself, and you can come out in two or three days. Get that sleeve. If you let me have this one, maybe I'll stay a week. Oh, no, not another one. I'm higher than a kite already. Over the last 30 years I've been analyzed, paralyzed, shocked, jolted, and revolted. And here I am again. Maybe I need a brain operation. Now, Miss Coral, we're going to leave you alone. And I want you to get some rest. Okay? Okay. You can go ahead. All right, I want about every 15 minutes for the next two hours, and about every half-hour for the next 40. Okay. And... Where are you, goddamn idiot? Forgot to lock the door. Deborah, stay back. You're of us. Feel nothing of your world. Deborah, go back. Don't get close to anyone. Their vibrations are poisonous. Don't fight up. Deborah... Hello, nut. Ready to rise and shine and meet the day? Hmm? My dear Hobbs, the sight of your face predisposes me to remain in seclusion. When did you last use a belt in a buckle, Hobbs? Is it true that you used to teach geometry? Yes. Yes, I did. Hey, listen, you're not even supposed to be in here. So pick up your pants and move out. Thank you, Hobbs. Could you teach me some sometime? Well, I haven't been well. She doesn't know geometry. She can't tell a circle from a square. When? When could you teach me? I'll make a decision when I've settled a few things with my friend Hobbs. I'll you later, pussycat. Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, you bastard. Ow! Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day. It was the nightingale, and not the lark, that pierced the hollow... the fearful, hollow... Won't you make Miss Coral...? Oh, two seconds. Oh, honey, really. What's the matter with you? Get away. Wait a minute. I don't got no... Not now. We don't care about your sex life and your loud orgasm... What is it? Hobbs! Look in there! Where are you, Deborah? Are you angry with me? Nag... What does it mean? Nag... fear. Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have touched you. Deborah. Deborah. She has the fire touch. Deborah. Deborah. She will destroy you if you listen to her. Didn't we warn you? Why do you keep betraying us? You will be punished, Deborah. Hobbs is poison. Hobbs is poison. She will destroy you if you listen to her. You are not a them, you are us. You are not a them, you are us. You aren't with them. Do not betray us. You will be punished. You will be punished. Hobbs is poisoned by you. Hobbs is poisoned by you, Deborah. Deborah, you are of us. You are of us. Come on, Deborah. Are you okay? - Not yet. - Come on. Not only us. Not only us. I am with you, Deborah. I am with you. I am with you, Deborah. I am with you, Deborah, now and forever. Not again. Look, I've just remembered. Would you like to share? Deborah, why don't you sit down and do some geometry with Miss Coral. - Geometry. - Now, now, look, I've always regretted not having learned to speak Chinese. It's the most widely spoken language in the entire world. Over 500 million people speak it. So if A equals B, how much is C? Don't leave this stuff out. It's very, very dangerous. Oh, yes, it's very dangerous. Very dangerous. Oh, look, there's an important person. I'd like to lay my case before him. Oh, that's Hobbs. My chief rapist. Oh, Christ, he's never satisfied. Where is he going? Where is he going? Mr. Hobbs is leaving us. What? What do you mean? You mean... You mean Hobbs is leaving us forever? You mean that beast Hobbs is leaving us forever? Hobbs? How did such a miracle happen? Thank Mr. McPherson. McPherson? Yay, McPherson! Hey, Hobbs! Sayonara, sweetie! Bon voyage, bimbo! Goodbye, you funny fruit! Take your tool home and go fuck yourself, if that's what you like! Nuthouse case! # Goodbye to you Mr. Fool # # Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye # # Now you're gone, Mr. Fool You're gone, you're gone # Yeah? Well, I'm out here and you're up there! A plus B minus A equals C. A plus B plus C equals McPherson. McPherson? Thou shalt wash me with hyssop, O Lord, and I shall be cleansed whiter than snow. Fucking nuts! Yay! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Feeling better, Helene? Did the doctor give you a pill? Is she all right? She's feeling better. Aren't you, honey? Case closed. I'm stamping Mr. Hobbs' case closed. Mr. Hobbs just put his head in his own gas oven. Is it true? Is it? Is it true? We heard it on the phone upstairs. Phone? Mr. Hobbs closed all the doors, all the windows, turned the gas on, and died! Died! Died! Christ! Jesus! Quiet! Everybody, please go back to your work. Stop that noise. Tear me apart, baby. Tear me apart. Tear me apart. Go back and work. I'll do anything you like, baby. Come on, baby. I love you, darling. Deborah? Deborah! Deborah! You're being very naughty. Now, you behave yourself. - Deborah, where are you going? - Dayroom. - You all right? - Uh-huh. - What's the matter? - Helene keeps hitting her clay, and I want her to be quiet. Helene? Did she hear about Hobbs? McPherson, we need you! I'm coming. I'm here, I'm here. All right, come on, come on. No. No. No! No! No! Sit down. Sit down. No. No. No. Goddamn it. Deborah, I'm sorry you had to hear about Hobbs like that. Just leave me alone. Can I do anything for you? - Just leave me alone! - You sure? - Cynthia! - Okay, stay right there. Nagua. Nagua. Nagua. Nagua. Nagua. Nagua... So, "nagua." Poison. My poison. They told me it killed Hobbs. I think your gods are cruel gods. No, no, no, no! Not always! Too often. When they're kind, I think it's only to trick you. Your mother called me this morning. They want to come and see you. Not my father. So let's talk about him. Every time he comes up, it makes you angry or frightened. He was always warning me about the men. The sex maniacs waiting around the corner to get me. That man pulled it out, and my father got angry at me. He said, "It's your fault, because you attracted him." Why does any man want me? I'm broken into and spoiled with a tumor. Don't hit me. Deborah... He hit me! Maybe your father had feelings for you he was very afraid of. What do you know about my father? Well, he was a human being. Maybe he knew what he felt. He was afraid of it in other men and wanted to protect you from it. Deborah, you're crying. No, I'm not. Maybe it's because you've just touched another person's pain. It feels like... wine. It's okay. Hold on to it. You've touched inside. Which is love? Truth? Forgiveness? It's all part of the reality you're so afraid of. Now, hold on to it. You did it. You made me cry. We have still many secrets to share. And we'll go on with it until we've seen them all. And when that's done, you can still choose even if you want to. I can be crazy if I want to? Bats. So, what's "bats"? It's American. It means... bats up in your head at night, and they fly around aimless, without direction. - You know? - I'll remember that. And if I should still want it? If you need it, if you want it... all the choices are still there. Shall we let him come? Yes. Yes. Okay. It's like living in a painting. - It's beautiful here. - It really is. Deborah, you look so pretty in that dress. - Don't you think so, Jay? - Yes, very pretty. You just look a little thin. Don't they feed you enough? Miss Coral says that the secret to enjoying hospital food is to be too ill to notice it. You mean it's that bad? No, she was just joking. Oh. Tell us more about Miss Coral. Well, she's this old lady, and she's been in and out of here for years, and she used to teach geometry. And she gives me geometry lessons sometimes. - That's nice. - You'd think if she could teach facts and figures, she wouldn't be here. Jay. Learning about facts and figures has nothing to do with knowing about yourself. Deborah. The bitch is very near. It will happen here, as we said. One can learn and learn and still be a schizo. They let you trust the doctor. You betrayed our secrets to her. It's so pretty, I'd like to come and have a picnic someday. Now see what she will do. She and the world. Look at those trees. Fantastic. Bye! I love you! You look beautiful! Was it all right? It was all right. Let's go back, then. Deborah, I want to tell you something. I'm going away on vacation next month. And I want to tell you now so you can get used to the idea. We have time to talk about it. For how long? Five weeks. Hmm. Where are you going? First, I'm going to conference in Switzerland, and then... then I'm going to Venice. Venice. Venice? It's a beautiful place to rest. I'm arranging for you to talk to Dr. Royson while I'm away. Dr. Royson? I like Carla's doctor. I'll talk with him. I'm afraid his schedule is full. Thank you. Naroi. What does it mean? It's a Uri word. It means... ...I have no choice. - Dr. Royson? - Yes. This is Deborah. I'll be back for you in an hour, Deborah. Hello. Please, sit down. Dr. Fried tells me that you like to smoke, so I got these especially for you. Dr. Fried says you have a private language. Would you tell me one of its words? Inai. What does that mean? "Thanks." That's very interesting. Sounds almost Indian. Have you ever been in the Indian country? New Mexico? Arizona? Naza. What does that mean? "No". It means "no". Very interesting. That sounds almost Spanish. Do you speak Spanish? You won't cure me with words, Doctor. Inai. Naza. Two words you don't know. Yet they seem to have entered the pattern of your unconscious. Did Dr. Fried ever comment on any connection between your private language and any other language? Spanish? Indian? Don't cut bangs with a hatchet. Bangs? Don't do brain surgery with a pickax. I can understand your resenting me not being Dr. Fried. I resent you not being you. Yes. Can you read my thoughts? # After the ball is over # # After the... # Can you read my thoughts? Of course. You're a whore and you're a bore. Pack it in. # Many a heart... # Can you read my thoughts? Your doctor went away today. Warm. Something happened? Very warm. Something she doesn't know about? - Cigarettes. - You stole them? Uh-huh. Okay, okay, all clear. I hope you people realize that you're in the presence of the secret wife of an abdicated king. His Majesty does not permit smoking in my presence. You little cunt. - Carla. - Hi. Hi. Where are you going? Um, back to B ward. My doctor's transferring me. They're going to release me in a couple of weeks. They want me to be an outpatient. Just to try it out. Hi. You look nice. How come I can't talk with you? I'm sorry, my schedule is quite full right now. Deborah. Deborah. Deborah. Deborah, I'm sorry. Look at me! I'm caught and falling! - Look at me. - Falling... Why? Why? Who are you? I'm with your pals. What I'm doing won't hurt you. This is the way we have to feed you. You won't eat, we do it this way. Don't leave me! Don't! Don't leave me! Deborah. Deborah. You're back. It's the day I said I'd be back. They told me you were dead. Can I help you out of this? Careful with the burns on her right arm. My surface doesn't even know if it's alive or not. Tell me. Say it, Deborah. I hate my life! I hate my body! I'm poisonous, and I hate it! I tried with Royson. I really did. But all he cared about was whether he was right or not. Did he tell you I disappointed him? No. I did. Just like I disappointed everybody for years and years. I hate myself. That's how you feel now. But that hate and shame, that's how much you'll be able to love one day. I'm insane! I'm insane! I'm insane! I'm insane! I'm insane! I'm insane! Totally insane. Just when there's talk of you getting well. - Huh? - Yeah. I hear they're going to let you out soon, maybe even today. Oh, yeah? Leave me alone, you hear? You leave me alone, or I break every bone in your dumb, stinking body. Deborah, I don't know if... You've, ahem, never been a marriage case, have you? Yes, I have. What happened? Did he die, or did he leave you? We divorced. Really? The same business? Mm-hmm. Of course. Do you enjoy this game? Any kids? Just as well. But it... must get lonely sometimes, especially at your age. I mean... what do you do? I do the same thing I've always done. I work. Sweeps it under the rug. No. I tried to recognize it and come to terms with it. What if I'm not strong enough to do that? You are strong enough. You can turn me off, you know. You can go off with your friends and write another paper on schizophrenia and get an award for it. But I can't turn me off. So I'm calling off the fight. So, you quit? Stay in a nuthouse for the rest of your life. The first time you came here, it's now two years ago. We talked about this. Two years ago? Mm-hmm. It's Christmas again. You created this cult, and you can destroy them. You're stronger than they are. If you give up Uri, you'll be able to feel in this world. Don't call off the fight, Deborah. You can win. You are strong enough, but you have to make the choice. And that means the defense speaks for itself. And that means that I am innocent, Your Honor... She was a child and I was a child in this kingdom by the sea, but we love with a love that was more than love, I and my Annabel Lee. She was a child... Can I take a walk or something? Deborah, you know better than that. Shit. Pussycat. Pussycat. Did I ever tell you what happens when a straight line bisects an 80-degree angle? I could tell you about the time they caught fish in the Sahara desert. Get out of my way. I got to pee. Okay. Is that okay with you, McPherson? Bring her right back. Okay, go ahead. Are you going to watch? Jesus Christ, that is more hell than I can stand. Look, why don't you check for cigarettes. I don't have any. All right, I'll be outside. Hurry up. We have to get back to the dayroom. Are you all right in there? I'm fine. Hurry up, Deborah. I'm going as fast as I can. Unbelievable. Pain. Simple, ordinary pain. God, the gods of the world know my pain! Deborah, what are you doing? - It's all right! - What are you doing? It's all right. It hurts. Oh, Deborah! I want to see Dr. Fried. Dr. Fried isn't here. She's at a party. - You can't... - We're so fucked! I want to see Dr. Fried. Where is she? - I told you, she's... - Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Where's Dr. Fried? Hey, hey, hey, hey! Where are you going? - I want to see Dr. Fried. - She burned herself. I'm sorry. Jesus! She burned herself? How many times do I have to tell you? - Where's Dr. Fried? - You can't see Dr. Fried. How come? You can't see Dr. Fried. She's not here tonight. I'll tell her the first thing in the morning. But I got to tell her something. It's very important. I got to tell her I felt pain. I felt pain. I felt pain in this arm, in this world, right now. Now, where's Dr. Fried? All of the closing rooms are full. - I'll take care of it. - Shoo, fly. Shoo. Flee. Let me see your arm. Still hurt? Uh-huh. All right, come on. You know something? I don't know why you keep doing this to yourself. But it hurt, don't you understand? Now you're making me crazy, you know that? Doesn't anybody understand? - What's the matter? - She's all right. - She's going to go to sleep. - Ah-ha, a telephone. Just put it down. Sit down. - I feel great! - Just sit down. Just relax, dear. You're going to be all right. You're going to be just fine. - Doesn't anybody understand? - Okay, right. I felt pain in my arm. Wonderful. Just relax. Oh, God. It hurts. It hurts, everybody. It felt really bad! You're gonna go to sleep now. Are you going to tell Dr. Fried? In the morning, like I said I would. You promise? Cross my heart. Have I let you down? Mm-hmm. Deborah. Your great sadness will be when you can no longer find us. Deborah. They're going to sacrifice me. You'll never see me again. - Don't let me die, Deborah. - No. Don't let me die. Don't let me die, Deborah. Deborah, save me. Deborah, save me. Deborah, save me. Don't let me die, Deborah. Don't let me die. Don't let me die, Deborah. Dr. Fried. Dr. Fried? Dr. Fried? Dr. Fried? - Deborah. - Dr. Fried? I said goodbye. Okay, okay, come on. Sit down. I promise, tomorrow you can go and see Dr. Fried, okay? Okay? Hey, can you take care? - Yeah. - Slit me. Just slit me. Okay. Just relax now, okay? Congratulations on your pain. Now you can say "ouch" when the bedbugs bite. Okay, Lee, let's go to bed. When the bedbugs bite. That's a good one. Mm-hmm, that's very good. Let's sit by the fire. It's over. So, it's all over. Let's drink. To the victory over our punishing gods. So I'm going to refer you to Ward B, and then you and I would work a little more together. And I will see about a school. There's a lot of things I can do without going to school. Yeah, I mean, I'd learn to be tough. I could be a hired killer, or I learned a lot about how nuts behave. I could be an actress. That's too dangerous. I could be a writer. - Did you write that? - Mm-hmm. "Dear Dr. Fried." Oh, Deborah. Now, help me. Okay. "She floats inside a hostile ocean." Uh-huh. "With destructive liquids." "I fly through molecules, then..." "Cobwebs on my nightmare. "An image. "Two eyes. "Both flower and rock." That's you. "I see colors. "Mine... "a droplet of salt from the sea. "And I am. Love, Deborah." That's beautiful. You like it? Thank you. I like it. Well... I think I'd better go now. Maybe. I'll see you in two days, huh? - Okay. - Happy New Year. It will be. - Please. - I don't want to go back. Deborah, come on. You're going to get in a lot of trouble. Yeah, I'm gonna... No! No! Who's up next? - No. - Yes, I am. - No. No, you're not. - Yes, I am. No! Deborah? Deborah! Come back here. You were asked to come back here. No, get back here. Please. Please just come back. Deborah, please. Let me go. Deborah, please, let's go back. - Why? - I don't want to get you in trouble. - You don't? - Okay, I don't want to get into trouble. Why? What are you so scared of? I like it out here. I don't want to go back. Yeah? Well, you remember when you were in the institution, and you were scared about going back into the world? - Yes? - Well, now you're out here. - Yeah? - And you're scared about going to the hospital. Right. Let's go back. Can't be scared all your life, Carla. - I know. - You should work on that. Oh! Hey! He's running, he's running. Look at these boys. - Wow! - Come on, get in here. Whoo! Just a few more minutes. No, no, please. Please, Deborah. - We're gonna get into trouble. - Time-out! How you doing? - Hi. - Hi. Come on, who's up? - Can I hit one? - No, no, Deborah, no. - I don't know who's up. - Who's that? Hey, Shark, she wants to hit one. What? She wants to hit one. Oh, come on, guys. We're playing a practice game. Tell the little girl to shove off, will you? Fine, that's fine. Deborah, I think we should. - No, I want to hit one. - I think she's gonna hit one. Shark, how long can it take? Come on! Come on, Shark, let her hit one. - Come on, let her hit. - Okay. All right. Have you ever played hardball before? Yeah. Twice. Stand back a little bit. Just stand back about... That's good. Right there. Move in, we're going to have a little infield practice here. All right. So, little Josephine DiMaggio wants to be in the big leagues, huh? Come on, little girl. Let's go. - You're cookin', good-lookin'. - I want you to look out for this one, because it's going to breeze right by you, little girl. Here we come. Come on, babycakes. - Oh! - Run! Run! Run! Go, go, go! Keep going! You're doing great! Way to go, you turkey. Throw the ball to second. You going to let her go? All right! Great juggling act. - That was great. - That was terrific. Thanks. Fine, fine, let's go, let's go. That was fine. Let's go back. - Come on. - Where are you going? No, no, we have to go now. We got to go. Hey, we play here every Saturday. Okay, fine. Whoo! That was great. What do you want to do now? You want to go see a movie? I could show you my apartment. Would you like to go see my apartment? No, I think I'd better go back now. - Back? - Yeah. Oh, okay, I'll walk you back. I could find my way. You sure? You sure you can find your way back? - Yeah. Mm-hmm. - Okay. Would you come visit me next week? Sure. Um... maybe when you get out, you could get a little place near me. Or we could even share. I think I'm going to like it out here. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay. I got to go. Oh, wait a minute. Your shoes. - Yeah. Bye. - Bye. Bye. See you next week. Sayonara, sweetie. - Bon voyage, bimbo! - Bimbo! Deborah. We could be with you always. Deborah. When they call.
