Tonight on the curse of Oak Island there we go solid wood we're on the side we're on the edge of something we need to figure the best way to take a look at that cipher is the instruction will help to stop the flood traps I should don't think the swamp has something to tell us x marks the spot we found another coin it could be very significant looks like we've definitely got something looks like it's nice Templar cross right now this ends right here there is an island in the North Atlantic where men have been looking for treasure for more than 200 years so far they have uncovered booby-trapped flood tunnels carved stones with strange symbols 17th century Spanish coins and evidence of a mysterious wooden vault covered in concrete six men have even lost their lives according to legend we'll have to die before the treasure can be here we go Rick lagina his brother Marty and their partners Craig tester and Dave Blankenship are hoping that today will be another exciting day on Oak Island come on right now this ends right here today yep we could bring up the gold shiny stuff whether we got to dig it up yeah that's the issue are you kiddin if you find something massive that's a piece of cake and we struck spending yesterday after spending nearly three weeks of drilling in the area known as the money pit the team was finally able to get a split-spoon coring bit past centuries of rocks and other debris left behind by previous treasure hunters when they retrieved it what they found was astonishing definitely got wood see what else we might have that's definitely clay I don't think that's bedrock maybe it's concrete Rick that is a possibility concrete and then wood that's the description that's what they found in the top of the vault after years of planning thousands of hours of hard work we should take this to my brother and millions of dollars invested the team on Oak Island believe they have had an enormous breakthrough they are convinced that what they may have discovered is not only the infamous Oak Island money pit but also the legendary Chappell vault I mean everybody since 1897 when that vault was first found has been trying to refine this and nobody has found it while drilling in the money pit back in 1897 treasure hunter William Chappell came upon what he later described as a large wooden vault with walls seven inches thick and measuring seven feet high located at a depth of 153 feet below the islands surface it was covered in a hard concrete-like substance which when tested was determined to be man-made but what was even more incredible than the discovery of the vault itself was the fact that Chappell noticed that on his drill bit could be found traces of gold he also discovered a tiny piece of what looked like parchment on which were written the letters VI unfortunately soon after the mysterious vault was discovered the shaft Chappell had begun digging flooded with soft water the hole collapsed and both the wooden vault and it's mysterious contents were never located again could this be what the laginas and their partners have just discovered are they really within a few feet of solving the Oak Island mystery once and for all Daniel where they say Marty good morning partner yesterday of the day who knows ya know you don't let yourself get excited anymore right not after now however many years it's been a long time you're the interesting to find out what you recover it that depth veteran treasure hunter dan Blankenship has been trying to solve the Oak Island mystery for nearly 50 years prior to that he had been a successful building contractor living with his wife in Miami Florida hopefully when the next one comes up we'll have something to look at yeah now it is nineties Dan has refused to give up trying to find out what if anything lies buried on Oak Island half the star let's see how it goes if they fall right away it'll fall right down I'll bet you anything the Corinne barrel the team is using can retrieve a core sample of up to two feet in length but given the potentially fragile nature of the target object care must be taken that it not be damaged by the process I don't believe we do okay I don't believe you got a fork or barrel let's do it six more that was the plan six inches it's a pretty quick trip Oh we'll take a look and see we have tell you what it went off wheezy we only laid short six inches we should have 18 inches of new stuff so we'll see you but I'll tell you what that went easy as hell just like it's in a big old vault lots of gold in there because the split-spoon core sampler seemed to have no trouble going 18 inches farther below ground than it did yesterday marty and the team are beginning to suspect that the drill is now quite possibly inside the Chappell vault the way at the bottom of that the seller would Morwood lots of what have Rick Marty and the team just recovered another piece of the mysterious Chappell vault or vertical what again best-case scenario we're into the original vault there's something of immense value there and we'll salvage it okay that's the bottom I mean we're all excited I think there was some trepidation on our part do we really want to split the barrel and open and see what we were in that's pretty exciting there we go that's good he's still that flat piece good after that well this side is facing something outside inside don't see no spendables here no me either we got some clay we got what looks like cement then we got five inches of wood running this way and then into a kind of luckily we're skidding down a post a vertical post I got more and more excited as they looked at it but you know I want a reserved judgment as always so I don't have to ride that emotional rollercoaster we're on the side we're on the edge of something that's what I think coming out there's no shortage of people who have theories about Oak Island it's not just one single code it's a double cipher code so this is the instruction on how to stop the flood traps we're on the side we're on the edge of something I mean it could be a shaft but there shouldn't be one there should there not at 142 feet I don't think of any shafts that was down that deep because the areas surrounding the money pit has been dug up and filled in dozens of times during the past 200 years it would not be unusual for the laginas and their partners to find the remains of old wood beams and other debris in one of their coring samples that's a machined edge I'd be virtually certain I built chance you know and we never used anything like I don't put anything vertical even if it was that filled you would never expect it to be perfectly a 180 degree you know you're gonna be preggers and we got a vault that we just found open anything we do below can start messing up that ball the other thing we can do we can think about trying to find a sucker this puppy then we lose it yeah whenever you drill especially in unconsolidated ground like this is there's always the danger that we lose the cavity we have what we hope is a big clue why risk drilling down and we lose a big piece of the information we're done for and then for Rick Marty and the other members of the Oak Island team finding the Chappell vault is one thing getting to it and retrieving whatever lies inside it he's quite another because now they have to figure out how to keep thousands of gallons of ocean water from flooding in and undermining their efforts to do so will require an enormous commitment of time and money or perhaps the solution could come from a stranger one who has traveled thousands of miles across the globe in hopes of presenting the laginas the details of his incredible theory long trip very long trek filled up in jet lag we're excited to see you yep daniel ronnstam is a researcher and amateur cryptographer from sweden who has spent the last several years studying the oak island mystery a little background would initially attracted you because you're a cryptographer and amateur self-described yes yes it's in 2010 I got interested in this Oak Island mystery I started investigating everything for six months and there I found more ciphers and codes so what I'm gonna show you today is very advanced cipher but beyond reasonable doubts I'm gonna take out some papers here like many Oak Island theorists daniel ronnstam believes there is something of great importance buried in the island's mysterious triangle-shaped swamp he also believes that during the course of his research he has discovered something unusual about the strange stone slab found in the money pit back in 1804 known as the 90-foot stone because of the depth at which it was discovered the strange stone slab contained numerous carved symbols which at the time were believed could be translated using a simple substitution method daniel ronnstam has come to oak island not to dispute this widely-held translation but to suggest that the code used was even more ingenious because it was meant to reveal not just one secret message but to it's not just one single code yeah it's a double cipher code yes and that will lead me on to a theory of how the market is constructed and why it is constructed as is okay as well big difference by breaking a cipher and deciphering a cipher when you break it you figure out the rules and the design of the cipher disk and it is very very hard to do in 1971 a former US military cryptographer dr. Ross Wilhelm used a 16th century book on cryptography to prove that the 90-foot stone contained a second message in Spanish but the methodology used to decipher the symbols was later found to be flawed what was real and found was of course the cyclist start on the first letter in the alphabet a and the first symbol in the sequence is a triangle so we write an A and then you move one step like this when you leave that letter and that simply is an O change one step and E and then we come to operating symbols and ask us to turn more than one step instead we do four steps go on two three four the two dots mean four steps yes okay inspired by wilhelm's theory daniel ronnstam now believes he has deciphered the stone's true translation dr. Ross William made an error of swapping two signals here but that's because he used the Spanish alphabet instead of the English 16th century alphabet okay and this is the reason villains cipher has been not believed to be correct and it says in English at 80 guide corn long narrow sea Inlet drain and then you have the lost F which means Francis Bacon Sir Francis Bacon is it possible that the double coded message on the 90-foot stone could really have been authored by one of the most accomplished and intriguing englishmen of the 17th century last year Norwegian researcher Petter Amundsen presented evidence that suggested Sir Francis Bacon a scientist Explorer an adventurer who had ties to a secret society of intellectuals known as the Rosicrucians had hidden something of great value in the Oak Island swamp could daniel ronnstam's findings be further evidence that bacon was also behind the construction of the money pit so this is the instruction on how to stop the flood traps by putting corn within the caving pit and South Shore pits possible other pits expands by the water on Clark's death Channel for nearly 200 years historians and researchers have tried to discover the source of the ocean water that floods the money pit and undermines virtually every effort to dig or drill at a depth below 90 feet in 1850 evidence of an elaborate system of five stone box drains was discovered at the area known as Smith's Cove covered with a layer of coconut fiber which would likely filter out ocean debris the Box drains appeared to be part of an elaborate system of booby-trapped flood tunnels designed to thwart the efforts of would-be treasure hunters it would also serve as a natural protection for whatever it was that was buried on Oak Island but could using something as simple and basic as corn to plug up the flood tunnels really be the answer in the oil business we use a lot of different things for lost circulation and you know corn I suppose would swell and it might do it after a few months is eaten away by maggots and it's was working again resets so why were fans baking as gang do this 42 million pounds of buried message this message activates the beacon the beacon is people will never forget to silent come try to get the treasure he's working a cycle I've specified she was working on us yep for the laginas and their partners daniel ronnstam's translation of the symbols on the 90-foot stone if correct might offer tremendous savings of both time and money but could something as simple as corn poured down shafts at strategic points on the island and really prevent ocean water from flooding the money pit coming up you think that this stone exists yeah we have to find the stone yeah we're just as interested as you were and I feel a money pit is probably Knights Templar to make a dual cypher it's very very hard so Swedish researcher at amateur cryptographer daniel ronnstam has just presented his incredible theory to Rick Marty and the other members of the Oak Island team team after conducting a careful and painstaking analysis of the strange symbols that were carved into the so-called 90-foot stone ronnstam believes that the stone was meant to be not only a lure for would-be treasure hunters but also a guide as to how corn could be used to prevent water from flooding the money pit and thus allow access to whatever it is that lies buried below wait a minute though I mean this is all based on the symbols that were supposedly on stone right we don't know that those are the real symbols right now of course we cannot know if if they actually came from the pit if we want to confirm this we have to find a stone what Marty son Alex is referring to is that any translation using the carved symbols from the 90-foot stone is potentially unreliable as the stone has been lost for nearly 100 years and there were no photographs or rubbings taken from it all anyone can go by are the various copies printed in books or drawings done from memory we do know there was a stone found in the in the pit at 90 feet right there was markings on it and then it was taken by JB McCully supposedly to Halifax but possibly to Truro that was his mother lost I mean he was the Mason it was amazing yes because of what appears to be a number of elaborate and ingenious engineering methods used in the construction of the money pit there are many Oak Island researchers who believe there are strong connections between the Oak Island mystery and the ancient fraternity of builders known as the Freemasons in fact the list of Freemasons who are connected to Oak Island he's a long one and includes prominent searchers like Gilbert Hedden and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt who first came to the island while still in his twenties we say you run this by me again you think that this stone exists somewhere yeah one of the theories is that a stone went to Halifax and was put in the front window of a bookbinding firm down on Upper Water Street was used as a marketing ploy according to historical records in 1865 a stone believed to be the original 90-foot stone was put on display in the window of a bookbinding business in Halifax Nova Scotia it was used as a lure to help raise capital for the treasure hunt on Oak Island but sometime after the end of World War one around 1919 the stone vanished and was never seen again I don't know if you guys know this or not but I'm a Mason and uh I'm gonna make a call to one of my brothers and see if he can assist in getting us access into Grand Lodge and see we can take a look at the archives and that's where the stone might be well if the stone or some information about it you know like a rubbing or a photo or or anything it the chances are it would be there okay guys go find the stone okay okay after sharing his ingenious theory with the oak island team swedish researcher and amateur cryptographer daniel ronnstam along with alex lagina and charles barkhouse have enlisted the aid of one of Charles's fellow Masons Cal Hancock they're hoping Cal can help them secure special permission to access the Masonic archives located in nearby Halifax thanks for doing this Kelly Ryan my pleasure if successful they may be able to track down information that will lead them to the original stone which has been missing for nearly 100 years was it difficult to get information to do it well I had three kids and now I only have two so brother Roy brother Kelly hello Daniel pleased to meet you asked me to write Alex again oh yeah so these gentlemen have some questions for you today we're looking for some information perhaps on an individual named JB McCully right apparently JB McCully removed a stone that was discovered on Oak Island in the money pit but had inscriptions on it we thought maybe there would be some kind of a record of where the stone went yes because I think there is stuff that was communicated to other masons and not out in the public we had a tendency to do that yes we do have a few secrets even possible for us to maybe take a look in the Grand Lodge archive before the historic things there you know if we could be of any assistance be only too glad to help we're just as interested as you were and I am personally feel that money pit is probably Knights Templar the Knights Templar it has been widely held that the Knights Templar a powerful order of warrior monks who fought to liberate the Holy Land from Islamic rule during the Crusades may have had substantial contact with the indigenous meghna people as far back as the 14th century Templars are tied in this has a very long Templar trail this is a midlife slag this is what's called their Grand Council flag we find it interesting that the mid MA Grand Council flag is actually a hundred percent reverse mirror image of the Templar battle flag many even believe that the Templars hid precious religious artifacts on Oak Island like the Ark of the Covenant the golden menorah of King Solomon and even the Holy Grail but although Freemasonry can in many respects trace its origins back to the Knights Templar is it possible that link could stretch all the way from the 14th century to the present day the massive undertaking that was done back then could only have been achieved by Knights Templar I'm kind of worried that what you find are we ready for it well what are we doing um what we got here is an ultrasonic cleaner yeah and same sort of thing used for dental instruments cleaning ammunition jewelry all that sort of stuff okay back on the island Marty lagina Craig tester and dive master Tony Sampson are about to clean a coin that metal detector expert Gary Drayton found near the money pit a few weeks ago at the time the coin was thought to be a two marvadi similar to the 17th century eight marvadi the team found in the Oak Island swamp last year if so it would do much to support the theory that Spanish pirates frequented Oak Island centuries ago and might very well have buried some sort of treasure here and what we can do is we can use it to clean a coin up just to take some of the tarnish off so you can actually see the date the mayor of the deed to me if it is one it would be very significant because we found one last year here's another one unrelated phoned by a different seeker it could mean a lot in two different locations who are locations yeah okay so we drop at the time or let her have it coming up I downloaded the data off the GPS oh good x marks the spot I still think the swamp has something to tell us whatever he found I made him think that there was something there absolutely okay just about done it was just about cooked back in the oak island war room Marty lagina Craig tester and Tony Sampson are about to see if by cleaning the old copper coin found near the money pit a few weeks ago they can tell just how old it is or where it may have come from there we are all right reveal your secrets okay let's see what you are get high hopes for this coin Tony okay well it looks like we've definitely got something on that side I can see some raised points there yeah well there's like bars sort of like parallel bars very very distinct but I I don't know what to make of it see what I'm saying see the line I mean those those are just shiny points they're lines well they are just think that yeah so it looks like a Templar cross huh Templar cross Knights Templar a Templar coin found near the money pit on Oak Island if so then this could be the first tangible proof that the stories and legends connecting the Knights Templar and Oak Island are true how do you know about that I'm amazing - oh are you really yeah did they have coinage they were the first bank during the period that stretches from the Middle Ages to about 1100 AD the Knights Templar were known not only for protecting pilgrims on their journeys to and from the Holy Land but for storing and guarding vast amounts of gold silver and other valuables in their fortresses over time these castles became the equivalent of the first banks as many people would deposit their valuables in Templar strongholds for safekeeping this later led to the Templars issuing letters of credit and other currency which in turn became the basis for the very same banking system still in operation to this day I guess it would add coins well I'll tell you what this Templar thing just keeps coming up and coming up and coming up and we need to get to the bottom of this Templar thing keep servicing on this island at least references to them seem to yeah alright let's get after it okay hey let me introduce you to the grand librarian of the Grand Lodge of Nova Scotia brother Gordon MacDonald Gordon I'm Alex lagina nice throughout there Tom Rogers at the Grand Masonic Lodge in Halifax grand librarian Gordon MacDonald has scoured through the archives looking for information on Jotham McCully the man believed to have removed the 90-foot stone from Oak Island sometime in 1865 yes unfortunately I can't find a mentioned as a lodge officer mm-hmm but there's another name Pitblado we've found references to this individual belonging to the same Lodge as McCully from 1869 through to around 78 and that's important because Pitblado and McCully were probably the two closest to the actual drilling operation McCully being listed as the chief engineer in some cases and Pitblado being listed as the Drilling Engineer according to historical records in 18-49 an Oak Island treasure Mining Corporation known as the Truro company was supervised by manager Jotham McCully and Foreman James Pitblado one day while drilling at the money pit Pitblado was seen to take something from an auger bit and quickly tuck it away in his pocket shortly thereafter Pitblado left the company and then attempted unsuccessfully to purchase the lot on the island that included the money pit unfortunately Pitblado died a few months later leaving what he found a mystery whatever he found on that open-face auger made him leave the company leave his position right I made him think that there was something there absolutely right and you you found mention of his name in your records oh yeah yes yeah we were able to find some pretty good info some of it was a bit of a dead end but I think we got some other names that we can check out though Alex Charles and Daniel were not able to track down much information about the fate of the infamous 90-foot stone they are hopeful that over time more information will come to light and more pieces of the puzzle will be brought together thank you so much really appreciate it great to meet you coming out you know as far as the swamp goes we need to go back I got one of the date off the GPS okay x marks the spot I still think the swamp has something to tell us it is a new day on Oak Island and although the weather is anything but welcoming it is not going to stop Rick lagina from looking for another breakthrough in the Oak Island mystery he is eager to explore the strange triangle-shaped swamp in hopes of discovering evidence of manmade flood tunnels if they exist they would seriously undermine the team's efforts to excavate the money pit area and retrieve the so-called wooden vault the team found a few days ago you really believe the Tree of Life is applied to this piece of real estate right out here yes like I show you the stones that we can calculate Marissa Paul joining Rick our Swedish researcher and Oak Island enthusiast daniel ronnstam and professional treasure hunter and metal detector expert David Spencer like other oak island theorists daniel ronnstam is convinced that the swamp holds the key to solving the entire Oak Island mystery according to his theory members of the Rosicrucians a secret society often linked to the Knights Templar came to Oak Island sometime in the 17th century they carried with them the sacred religious objects the Templars had rescued from the Holy Land during the Crusades ronnstam also believes that in an effort to hide their tracks the templars deliberately created the swamp in the shape of a pyramid or triangle only after first digging an underground vault Daniel's been very insightful in terms of his theory and you know he believes there's a vault in the swamp so that's one target can we find it I don't know does it really exist I don't know I'm in said ronnstam also believes the vault lies at the so-called eye of the pyramid otherwise known as the mercy point which in turn corresponds to a point on what is known in the Old Testament and in the Hebrew Kabbalah as the Tree of Life but based on his research ronnstam is convinced that the reason Rick Marty and the Oak Island team have so far not found the actual mercy point is because they have been relying on imprecise measurements done on foot he believes that only precise GPS coordinates using the boulders of Nolan's cross as a guide will allow the team to accurately pinpoint and hopefully enter the mysterious underground vault we got the data downloaded the data off the GPS David Spencer has marked the precise GPS coordinates on his computer in an effort to create an accurate map of the mercy point area i bisected that ran a 90 degree off of that and that's x marks the spot so we get a boat in and we figure out go take a walk the idea that there is something strange and perhaps of great importance lying at the bottom of the Oak Island swamp dates back to 1960 it was then that Oak Island treasure hunter Robert Restall and his son Bobby became convinced there was a so-called mystery box lying in the swamp near what could be described as the southeastern corner could this be connected in some way to the alleged booby-trapped flood tunnels or could it be as daniel ronnstam believes something of even greater importance you're the god of the swamp I got a bit of deadpan now guys just three feet we flex which Republic are they on the run there or are you just like nothing wrong I'm on one at the Mogollon another one here it's a line of rocks the liner or going from where we were last year on the rocks going this one last summer when Tony Sampson dove in the swamp near the mercy point he found a submerged flat rock surface which the team believed might be the entrance to the underwater vault now Tony believes he's standing on a similar structure but at a different location in the swamp could the vault be much larger and more elaborate than anyone ever imagined okay well one thing's for sure we found enough information that leads me to believe that look we have to drain it in order to retrieve the information in order to get to the box I'd like to see it drain and let's define what we what we've got out here we're not gonna figure that out with four feet of water in that swamp in order to find the answer what he's standing on and what it might be is to drain the water and the swamp let's get the hell out of this ring but the vault exists and there's something in that vault whatever that may be here's proof that the search is legitimate but there's something here to be found some story to be told so guys we want to do an additional research what do we need to do and who's doing it let's talk about after daniel ronnstam's departure from Oak Island Rick Marty and their partners meet in the war room armed with new information about both the money pit and the swamp it is time to decide just how and where they will next focus their resources you know as far as the swamp goes we were in there and we're there are still anomalies that needed investigating yes we need to go back drain or dig but we're going back okay but you're handling it I'm gonna do it all right so that's that part what else are we doing here today well as you know we went to investigate and maybe find out what happened to that inscribed stone that was found yes unfortunately we couldn't track down any leads but one of the guys up there is convinced that it was the Templars that did it lots of people think Templars so how do we run that to ground well I got a call the other day from a woman named Kathleen McGowan she's a researcher who also believes that the Templars are behind this she is emphatic that the proof and even some clues as to what we can expect to find over here is in Europe does she seem credible to you very really absolutely she says that the sites are in the South of France we could just you know take a quick jog over there and have a look you think it's worth it I do yeah all right why don't you set it up with her get the dates and stuff and we'll do it okay all right so let's talk about the money pit right that's probably the most important thing we got going we talked about one of the tests we wanted to do this summer this dye test in an effort to try and shut off the water that has flooded the money pit over the years Rick Marty and the team are planning to recreate what is known as the dye test a test that was first conducted by Frederick Blair in 1898 and has been repeated only a handful of times since first dye in the form of non-toxic colored powder he's poured down one of the islands many treasure holes then after a period of a few hours spotters placed at various points along the coastline will watch to see if the dye can be found seeping out from certain areas and if dye is seeping out then these are also the most logical places to find where ocean water could be coming in I do have one issue on that who's finding what we found in the muddy pit do we want to send the water down there to see where that comes out as opposed to 10x go down the hole we just drilled yeah I don't think we'd get enough water in it well I think maybe you can I mean at years we're taking a risk taking a risk of collapse and we have such high hopes for why would we do that why would we risk what you consider to be so valuable it's just not worth it I don't think it'll work I don't think these two guys say no let's not do it what do you say I say no Charles I wouldn't do it done okay yep I'm fine with that yep rather than risk damage to what they refer to as the Chappell vault the team has chosen borehole 10x located just 180 feet away from the money pit as the best alternative location for the dye test and I think that's about it guys yes Crown Royal time David yes ground roll time all right good good the laginas and their partners have now come closer to solving the Oak Island mystery than any team in more than 200 years they have found not only the location of the original money pit but also what appears to be the strange wooden vault that was first discovered back in 1897 they are also more and more convinced that there is something strange and perhaps quite incredible lying at the bottom of the triangle-shaped swamp but is it really possible there is more than one treasure site on the island as some researchers believe or could the island which is defeated all who have ever tried to unlock its secrets and has so far taken the lives of six men and simply be luring the laginas and their partners deeper and deeper waiting for the opportunity to choose its next victim next time on the curse of Oak Island in order to dig in the money pit we have to shut off all the flood phones and maybe this digest will lead us in that direction we're here to the South France and we're really trying to take back to find the roots of this if you were gonna look for the treasure of the Knights Templar I could stop in Polk Island I found something I'm excited
