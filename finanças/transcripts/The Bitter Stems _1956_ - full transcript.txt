One to Ituzaingo. First class. One way only. We arrived at the perfect time. We don't have to wait. The rain is awful. It's going to rain more. I thought it wouldn't be so hot traveling by night. Yes, but it doesn't matter. Of course it doesn't matter. We'll have a good time. It's always pretty outside. We worked a lot. Now we'll take a break. You worked like a dog, Gasper. Yes. But it is worth it, Liudas. They will be saved. The three of them. May they come to this beautiful land... to forget. You have to forget the bad things. - Do you like to forget? - You can't always. You have to learn to forget, or nothing's okay. - Tired? - Very tired. But with money. The idiots believe. They believe. I also believed. Some months ago, we couldn't go on holidays. It was a tough fight. Now you can rest at your place. I'm going to sleep for a long time. Yes, Liudas. You're going to sleep for a long time. A very long time. You are right. Some months ago, we couldn't go on holidays. It was a tough fight. Some months ago... life was different for me. Gasper, the chief editor wants to see you urgently. Okay, I'm going. Better go now, because he's in a bad mood. Write this. It's not the first time, Gasper. We can't continue like this. We can't. I need the report on the fire. - What fire? - This afternoon's, Gasper. This afternoon's. It's in all the papers. It was on all the radio stations. I don't listen to the radio, and I haven't read the papers, yet. But... If it was up to me, you could come collect your salary... I collect my salary for my work, Noriega. But when the director asks at 7:00 why there's no one around... he yells at me. What do you want? Here. Here is the information on the fire. Roman is bringing good photos. I want long quotes. Hello? Hello, how are you, Carmen? Hold on. Gasper. Hey, a little more effort, and come earlier, okay? How are you, dear? I suppose we'll have dinner together. - Hello. - Hello. I'll be at the bar. Who? Be happy. Nebide, your great editor. I'll be right there. Hi, Nebide, how are you? Fine. Waiting for your translation, Gasper. As you didn't give it to me, I came for it. I had a lot of work, and I've got some problems. You should have told me. I would have given you an advance. It's not only that. There's an issue, right? Issues are always disturbing. By the way... the first part of the translation... is quite lame, Gasper. What did you see in it? It lacks, I don't know... fluency. That's it, fluency. I did the best I could, Nebide. Whatever. - Is it all here? - All of it. Well, then I'll see you soon. Nebide. Yes? - When can I...? - Call me one of these days. And when is "one of these days"? I don't know. In five or six days. I have some difficulties with the bank. But I'll arrange everything as soon as I can. Good bye. Have you got a smoke? - How did it go? - Just promises. - And the credit extension? - I have two more days. I had to beg them. They talk about seizing it, as if you were a criminal. Well, don't go like that. It happens to all of us. It's not only the money problem. Tell me, Andreani... do you like working here and at the magazines? Sometimes. You don't? I got into journalism expecting a life of adventure. To visit many countries, to talk to heads of state... to write about the customs of unknown people. To be the man of the books, of the novels. - To be a hero, Andreani. - A hero? If you get to be one, you won't be aware of it. There are reporters like the ones you mentioned. But they started from scratch, Gasper. From scratch. Take the hero out of your head. Live in peace. What peace? Nebide's? The one of those who are content with anything? I don't know how you can live next to Noriega... next to Yrurtia, who only talks about soccer. And Sange who talks about boxing. And Rufino, about women. And Gasper, who talks all daylong about a glorious boss. It's a deceit and a comfort... to blindly deliver our fate to another man... as heroic and responsible as he might be. You make him infallible. You have an old passion. The need to obey. - Passion to obey? - To be a subordinate. But not a simple subordinate. Napoleon, Alexander the Great, Caesar's subordinate. That's bad, Gasper, bad. That doesn't work. Hello? Yes, Susana, yes. Okay. Choose the film you want. At 10:00? Perfect. Let's go. I'm sorry, Alfredo. I didn't know it was a war film. - Tell me why. - You wouldn't understand. Yes, I never understand. We've got nothing to talk about. Tell me, will you continue to hold back your troubles? You've had this obsession for a long time. My troubles. Can you just calmly watch as a city is bombed? A battle? I can't. I can't. And yet, I didn't do anything, just like you. I stayed here. I told myself a thousand times that I have a family. Excuses. Alfredo. I was saying if everybody who watches war films got like that... Are you bored with me? No, why? - You are serious, sad. It's not that, Susana. It's my problem. Sometimes I think my life is worthless. I don't do anything important. I'm 32... and I haven't found anything worth working for. Something or somebody. I can't keep on like this for much longer. You understand, Susana? I'm sorry. Today I had to review many models. I'm very tired. I understand. See you tomorrow. Hello, Gasper. What a surprise. - You in this place? - What's up, Chavez? Alone? Are you expecting somebody? You're like a cop. You ask too many questions. Don't you say that. - Would you like a drink? - A brandy. I know. You liked the photo in the window. What a woman! - Does she dance or sing? - She sings. But she's sick. That's what they say. What a pity. You'll have to come some other night. Here's my wife. Let me introduce her. - Have you met Gasper? - I've never met him before. He's one of our best reporters. But he's got such a character. I owe him a big favor. That matter about the whiskey... How much Chavez spoke. I suddenly noticed something. For some time you were observing me closely. You wouldn't stop staring at me with your piercing eyes. You look weird. Do you have a headache? No, I'm very tired, Liudas. - And with this heat. - Yes, it's very hot. - And it won't rain. - Tickets, please. You only got one way? The return trip would be useless. It only lasts 24 hours. Tickets. - Hey, buddy, what's your name? - Misha. See? From Europe, like me. They come to a country with a great future, of peace. Like you. To a country with a great future. Looking for money. If Chavez hadn't talked so much that night... if he just hadn't said I was a reporter... but he said it. And you heard everything. - So, you're a reporter. - Yes. - For which newspaper do you work? - La Voz. La Voz? Important. - That's what they say. - I worked as a journalist. - Don't you believe me? - I didn't say anything. Editor at the Europe Morning Newspaper. - And what are you doing here? - I'm a barman. You didn't make much progress. I move forward in a jiffy, and then I sink. That's why. And what did you do to move forward in a jiffy? - Smuggling. - What of? Many things. Smuggling. I made money, and I sank. - Sank? - I was betrayed. I escaped from the police, and I lost my documents. Everything. That's why I don't exist. And here? I'm paid less because I don't have documents. But I'll quit being a barman, and I'll do business. - Journalism is great business. - Journalism? Fantastic business. Look, a decent journalist never gets anywhere. A decent journalist doesn't matter. I'm talking about big business. Do you understand? What is it about? Is it something clean like smuggling? No, something normal, secure. You put signs on the streets. Let me explain it to you. Anyone can do it if you're a journalist here. And why doesn't anybody do it? Because nobody knows about getting rich in big business. In a jiffy. - Hello, "Skull". - How are you? Do you like my new hairdo? It makes you look like a femme fatale. Dirty old man. Alfredo. Yes, Mom? - Good morning, Mom. - Good morning, son. Again with this heavy hammer? Give it to me. I'm used to using it. I was going to open that can. - Did you get the advance? - What advance? Alfredo, I asked you for that money, 'cause tomorrow I have to pay the rent. - And besides... - I'll bring it tomorrow. I must say I forgot. Can you forgive me? Okay. Go to bed, and I'll bring you some orange juice. Thank you. This afternoon, I have a meeting in Buenos Aires. Could you wake me up at 1:30? Yes, I'm going to pick up Esther at school... so we can go to the eye doctor... but we'll be back by that time. You sleep very little, Alfredo. - The meeting couldn't be later. - You should have come earlier then. - Are you having lunch at home? - Yes. Alfredo, don't read today. Try to sleep now. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Mom. STORIES OF KNIGHTS ARITHMETIC Alfredo. Get up, Alfredo. It's time. The dreams again? You have to forget those things, son. They're in the past. I'm going to prepare lunch. Here we have all of the businesses in Europe. You have to translate it. - Can you translate French and German? - Yes, and a little Italian. Great, because we have to adapt the things said by people over there... for people from here. We need ideas, to translate, to write things. To be clear, Liudas... the journalism school is correspondence journalism. To teach journalism by correspondence. In Europe, I made a lot of money with that. - Do people believe in that? - You are still very gullible. In Paris, there are fools. In Berlin, there are fools. In Buenos Aires, there are fools. It's sad, but it's a fact. Partners, Gasper? Let's be clear, Liudas. I don't have a cent. Neither do I. But that's not necessary for our business... if you've got something up here. Partners? There's no electricity. I'll open the windows. How did you get this place? Mr. Nelson, patron from Magyar, has gone to Europe for a year. I rented the office. I look after it, and pay little rent. It has all we need. A typewriter for you. An iron safe for the money we will make. A closet for the papers. And a mimeograph for me to work. One, two telephones. All the things we need to work. Big enthusiasm all daylong. All day long? - And your job? - I've quit. You can't be a barman until 4:00 in the morning... and then come here all day long. But Liudas, that was a secure job. We have to see if this works. No, to win, you have to take risks. That's the way to build a great business. Do you really think this will be a great business? Yes, I do. It'll be a great business. In a jiffy. You will see. It's difficult to think that with journalism. Yes, Gasper. Tell me... when you say you're a reporter, what do people think? He's a poor devil that owes everybody. No, people think that reporters call the shots. That the world is in the hands of the reporters. - Who believes that? - Many people, Gasper. The people in whom we are interested. They like it. Don't they say that journalism is the fourth estate? Many want the fourth estate. People believe that a reporter's card is a magic wand. With the card, you get anywhere. Actresses, theaters, dressing rooms. Women say nice things because you've got a card. They believe it, Susana. They think that being a reporter is almost like being the President. I tell you that they believe it. I don't understand this business very well, dear. - What will the academy do? - It will create journalists. We will be sending lessons around the country. It will be no good for them, but... - And are the students going to pay? - Of course they are. Tell me, Alfredo, do you like that? What? Do you like doing that? To swindle? I don't know if I like it. You are swindled, and you swindle the rest. Like it or not, you swindle for money. And now I want money. I need money. Alfredo, you haven't answered me. You only get rich by swindling, destroying. What, do you want me to keep on suffering at the newspaper? Writing stories for the magazines? Sometimes you read me very nice stories. For which I'm paid very little. No, Susana. I want to leave the routine and move forward. I don't want to take orders from a guy like Noriega. I like working with Liudas. He is so bold. Have you ever wondered how many papers are in the country? I never thought about it. He, being a foreigner, knows. He found out because it's good for our business. We'll have free advertising. Can't you see? Free. Those papers cannot pay a press release service. We will provide them with that. We'll look in the archives... we'll copy some news from here, a story from over there... changing the author's signature. Because that author will never know we used it. News from foreign magazines, tips for your home, jokes. And with all that material, we will print booklets... that we will send to the newspapers. AM of them will be the same. Who knows in Pehuajo what is published in Bariloche? And in exchange, the papers will publish our ads. "Be a great journalist. A world for you. "Fabulous opportunities. "Specialized teachers will immediately start giving lessons... "that you will work on, while still being able... "to complete your daily tasks. "Fill out our voucher, Sign it, and send it. Be one of our many students." Hello. There are many. They don't fit under the door anymore. Thank you. Didn't I tell you? See what a voucher is worth? Writing your name and sending it over convinces people. Psychology to recognize idiots. Okay, let's think about serious work. The academy is in the name of Alfredo Gasper. Why did we put it only in my name? Remember, I don't have documents. It would be a waste of time to ask for new ones. Without documents, I cannot cash checks. I trust you. You. Can I address you informally? Of course. Tell me, Liudas... where do you think we'll get with all this? We will be the owners, the owners... of a newspaper chain in the rest of the country. We will make money, Gasper. A lot of money. And with the money? I'm going to bring my wife and my two kids. You didn't tell me you had a family. We had to talk about more important things. They stayed there. I want to bring them and give them a future. I look at the war, the tyranny in Europe. Peace here. I can't be happy here, knowing that they suffer over there. First, I'll bring Jarvis, my eldest son who I love a lot. He's 20. Dangerous age for him to be there. You don't know what that is like. Compulsory working camps, accusafions. You never know what's going to happen. And the young suffer. That's why I want to bring Jarvis first. So this money... - will be for that. - Of course. If we make this academy a success... my family will always be grateful to you. We'll make this academy a success, Liudas. You have to bring them, save them. Look, for you to do it as soon as possible... three quarters of the earnings are for you. - The rest is for me. - Why? - You have a lot of work. - Don't worry. The thing is to bring them soon. To save them. We will save them, Liudas. Thank you, friend. Thank you. I'll be able to bring them soon. My wife. My kids. Jarvis. Your eyes were shining in a strange way... when you spoke about your wife... and your kids. That day... I also discovered that you could be kind. I'm telling you. He can't believe I was a lion tamer. You don't believe it. - How much more to go? - Two more stations. Okay, as you don't believe in lions... I'll tell you another story, so you will believe me. Bad buddy, you don't believe me. I was a good friend, Liudas. I believed... you had a son. You had to bring him. And suddenly... I had a mission. My life had a meaning. The academy changed. From a brilliant business, it became a barricade. My typewriter was an automatic rifle... to save your family. To save Jarvis. You're finally here. Look. Academy ad, academy ad. Our ads are published by 122 newspapers. Didn't I say? Didn't I say the academy would be a success? We will do it in a jiffy. And most importantly... is that the checks arrived, Gasper. Checks! Fools believe, fools pay. We are going to make money, Gasper. A lot of money. - Are you still working on that? - It's worth it, right? - A lot of money is coming in. - For your partner. Don't you understand, Andreani? We're going to save Liudas' family. Journalism lessons by correspondence... to save a family from war and tyranny. Do you need to swindle so many people? Nice way of saving them. It's the only way I've got to face the war. At long last, I'm fighting it. The war, do you understand? The war. No, Gasper. The war was fought far away from here... and it was no joke. You risk nothing more than hours of work. Now I know that your work is perfectly paid. It gives you the right to be a hero. I should have never told you anything about this. You said it, Gasper, because your vanity is huge. Why my vanity? I could have fought. You are here. I couldn't leave Mom and Esther here to take their chances. Did the soldiers ask themselves if they could leave their families? They left them and went away. They couldn't choose. You could, Gasper. - You chose to stay here. - Do you think I'm a coward? I think you are not humble. You think of yourself as exceptional... for doing what many do, knowing they fulfill an obligation. You are swindling, Gasper, and when you discover it... you're going to suffer. See you tomorrow. Too much work? You look tired. More or less. And your nerves? I'm fine, Susana. You're not fine. You get exhausted working. I'm glad to feel this exhausted, you know? Yes, I know. But I don't like it. When will you understand? Never. When will you understand that it hurts seeing you so worn out? I see you little. It's all there. Your selfishness. Yes, you see little of me. I miss you. Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. If what is worth it? Tell me, Alfredo... are you sure Liudas has a son in Europe? - Where are you getting at? - I don't know. But sometimes I think that if that Jarvis is an invention... you would be working uselessly for someone else... giving him a big part of your money... without you having enough for many things you want. Alfredo. I didn't want to listen... because the doubt was already inside me. To doubt is to kill faith. And the only thing that held my work... was my faith. We've arrived, haven't we? - Yes, we're arriving. - And no rain yet. But it'll rain soon. Shall we go? Come in. Pretty house. - Do you like it? - Yes. Give me your suitcase. So many books! And so many records! Beethoven, Stravinsky, Prokofiev. You've got a lot to listen to. The Moldau. - Can I play it? - Of course. I left your suitcase in my bedroom. - You will sleep there. - Okay. - It'll be nice to be here. - Yes. The only bad thing in this town is the telephone. Sometimes communicating takes a long time. It doesn't matter. I have no one to call, and nobody will call me. Big garden. Tomorrow we'll work there. Yes. What? You don't think I'm a good gardener? You will see. Do you want me to make some coffee? Okay. I'll set the table. Everything is in the cupboard. Nice device. Can you make coffee with it? Okay. Let's do it here. You know, Gasper... Jarvis really likes coffee prepared that way. Jarvis. Jarvis. You existed. Andreani and then Susana... made me doubt... and I was looking for proof... something that confirmed it... that gave me assurance. BE A GREAT JOURNALIST "For newspapers in the capital." He hadn't told me a word about this. "Application for residence in the country." Not this, either. Sure, now you have time to do the formalities while I'm working... and so you will be able to put the academy in your name... and be able to cash the checks. In fact, you feel you are the lord and master of the business. Hello. You came early. - How are you? - Fine, Liudas. Many pages for the mimeograph today? No, just the ones for the last lesson. I left them on your desk. Great. The complete course. You won't have to work so much, Gasper. Yes. I won't have to work so much. And perhaps you will no longer need my work. New suit. Nice fabric. - Expensive? - The good stuff is never cheap. Besides, for big business, you need to be well dressed. Hello? Yes, hold on. Yes, Elena, I understand. But you shouldn't have called. I've told you many times I don't want you to can here. I work here. Why complicate things? I wanted to be sure you would be coming. Don't worry. Tonight I'll be there. - Goodbye. - Thank you. Goodbye. To what could have been. Do they all believe? Does Gasper trust you? Gasper believes everything I say. Why wouldn't he believe about Jarvis? Jarvis, the son who has to come from Europe. Why wouldn't he believe about Jarvis? Why wouldn't he believe about Jarvis? Why wouldn't he believe about Jarvis? Why wouldn't he believe about Jarvis? Hello, Gasper. How are you? Fine. You are drenched. Are you that hot? - It must be my nerves. - What's wrong? Are you worried? Something serious? - No, I'm very tired. - I see. Don't think I didn't notice you worked a lot. We have to rest. But we can't leave the office for too many days. Don't you want us to spend some time at my place? It's not too far and we will be outdoors. I would like to, but I don't want to bother your family. It's no bother. My mom and my sister are going to Tandil for a few days. Perfect. We'll have a good rest. I'll keep on working and finish the last lesson. Good idea. Mom, we will never leave. I'm ready, dear. If we don't get a cab, you'll see what happens. Did you put the tickets in your purse? - Yes, Mom. - And Alfredo? I don't know why he went to the kitchen. Alfredo! Alfredo, what are you doing? I'm fixing this. I don't think it works. Great timing. After you gave us the trip... we might miss the train. - Hurry up. - I'll be right there. Finally, Alfredo. We're going to miss the train. There are clean clothes and shirts in your closet for the whole week. Take care. You're working too much. Get rid of the bags under your eyes. Mom and Esther have left. And they won't come back, Liudas. Now we are alone. Completely alone. - What happened? - Nothing. The coffee maker broke. I'll boil some water in the electric kettle. And now? A short circuit. - I'll get a new fuse. - You need help? No, thank you. Bravo! The lightning gives light. Pity Jarvis is not here to help you. He understands a lot of this. One day he... Mr. Liudas had to go to Chile for two or three months. He asked me to pay you to reserve the room. There was no need. Mr. Liudas always pays. He's such a good man. It's 630 pesos. He asked me to send his clothes over. Then I'll show you his room. Meanwhile, I'll prepare the receipt. - Here's the receipt, sir. - Thank you. Tell me, do you have the address of a lady that used to visit Mr. Liudas? A lady? No, sir. No women visited Mr. Liudas. He was a very serious man. Fire destroys everything, Liudas. I'll burn your body and your clothes. It's what you did with my heroic mission. Dust and ashes. What is yours, now is mine. I'll be happy with your effort, your idea and your money. This is my revenge, Liudas. Hello, darling, how are you? It's a beautiful day. We're going to enjoy the weekend. - Will you be long? - No. Let me put these papers away and we'll be off. - Do you have a lot of work? - I've been alone for two months. There's a lot to do. When is Liudas coming back from Chile? I think he'll stay there for a while. Let's go? - Good morning, Jose. - Good morning, sir. The cleaning is done. How was your weekend? - It was good, thank you. - I'm glad. I left the mail there. I ARRIVE ON MONDAY BY PLANE JARVIS Why wouldn't he believe about Jarvis? Jarvis. Jarvis. Jarvis! Jarvis! Jarvis! Come in. Mr. Gasper? Yes. I'm Jarvis Liudas, sir. - How do you do? - How do you do, sir? Dad told me a lot about you. Sit down. Don't you want to take your jacket off? It's very hot. You speak Spanish very well. I studied it when Dad came here. I knew that some day we would meet again. At the boarding house, they told me he's in Chile. That's correct. Some business there. - When does he come back? - I don't know. - Where can I write to him? - He's traveling a lot. We could see some of my dad's friends. Perhaps they know something. I'm your dad's only friend. Aren't you thirsty? Shall we drink a beer? I'll ask for them at a bar downstairs. It's very handy. We always use it. They'll bring them immediately. The only friend. No other one. You won't meet anyone. You won't find any evidence. Nothing. I have to hold you back. Go with you everywhere. I need time to think up an explanation... and get out of this cleanly. - Hello. - Hello? Yes, two beers for the Academy. Why did you mention other friends? Did your dad tell you about somebody? No, he only wrote about you, Mr. Gasper. About everything you did for us. I don't know how to thank you. I cannot accept your gratitude, Jarvis. I did what I had to do. But you can accept our affection. My dad loves you. And he taught us to love you. These clothes are too thick for this time of year. - Don't you have lighter ones? - No, I sent them by boat. Let's buy you something. What do you think? And I'll also show you Buenos Aires. Thank you. - Strike! - Bravo. Very good shot. I like this game. My brother likes it, too. Didn't my dad tell you about my brother? Your dad only talks about Jarvis. All day long it's Jarvis here, Jarvis there. Jarvis. Jarvis. Jarvis! And I believed it. And I believed about Jarvis. Alfredo, is something wrong? No, it's okay. Aren't you feeling well? No, I'm a little tired. - What a pity. - Why? I wanted to ask you to go to a place I'm dying to see. - Where? - Look. GO WITH YOUR FRIENDS THE PARROT Happy? Have you got a light? A light. Thank you. I think I know the boy. Me? It can't be. I just arrived from Europe. From Europe? Then we have to teach him how to dance tango. In Paris, they started teaching me, but I still don't know how. Here you'll finish learning how to dance a good tango. What an observer. Are you babysitting? He's in good hands. Elena loves foreigners. Leave me alone. You dance very well. You are like a local. What's wrong, Alfredo? Nothing. I've got a headache. I'm leaving. If you want, stay. No, I'll go with you. What a shame. We were getting along so well. - Goodnight. - Bye. Do you still have a headache? Yes, a little. I'll leave you at your place and then I'll go home to bed. Elena is nice, isn't she? She told me I reminded her of someone. - Did she say who? - No. I insisted, but she didn't want to. Maybe if we meet another time... You must be careful with that kind of woman. They are always lying... especially to young boys like you. That's strange. She didn't seem to be lying. - Good morning, Alfredo. - How are you, Jarvis? - What are you doing? - Nothing. This device is fun, since I didn't have anything to do... You will soon have something to do. A friend of mine, professor of the School of Agronomy... will help you with what we spoke about. Dad is going to be very happy when he finds out about this. Alfredo. Don't you find it strange that Dad doesn't write? He could have calculated the date of my arrival. I've told you he's traveling everywhere. What do you want to do later? - I don't know. - Do you want to go out tonight? Okay. - Where would you like to go? - Well... I'd like to go to the dancing club. The woman from last night, I've told you what kind of woman she is. You go once with them and... Why do you do that? Dad always does it... and I started doing it when he lived with us. I'm sorry. I didn't know it annoyed you. I'm sorry. The heat gets to me. And your insistence with that woman. - Hello. - What are you doing here? I imagine you haven't forgotten your meeting. - Who with? - With me. You told me you'd take me to a workshop because... - Jarvis Liudas, my sister Esther. - Nice to meet you. Jarvis arrived from Europe a few days ago, as I told you. - Are you here on your own? - No, Alfredo is a good friend. Don't trust him. Alfredo has just one friend. The Academy business. Can you come with me? - Yes, just a moment. - Okay. Since you are on your own... why don't you come home for tea whenever you like? It'll be a pleasure. - When? - This afternoon if you can. Don't you think that's a good idea, Alfredo? I don't know. Perhaps we'll be busy. No, you had invited me to go out, Alfredo. We had nothing to do. Then we will be expecting you. Will you come? Guys! You were there. The tea is ready. Let's go to the table. You there, Jarvis. I made these buns. Be careful, Jarvis. They start with the buns and they end up with the wedding cake. I would like to have a girlfriend like Esther. A lot of tea? A lot of tea? No, not very much, ma'am. Mom, don't you think Jarvis could come to visit us regularly? - He's so lonely. - Do you think he's so lonely? And your glasses, Esther? Mom, is it necessary? You know what the eye doctor said. Jarvis. Don't you like the buns Esther baked? Yes, ma'am. I've never seen such a pretty girl... with glasses that fit her so well. Jarvis is nice, isn't he? Yes. - Shall I help you? - Okay. Finish drying that. What is he going to do in Argentina? He likes agronomy very much. His father told me he likes studying. I like the boy. What a day, Liudas. You see? Jarvis has befriended Esther and the family. Everything is more tolerable than I had expected. I'll make you disappear. A telegram from Chile. An alleged call from you saying you won't come back. Romantic issues. A woman. A woman. Elena. She's the only one who can mention you... who can talk. We shall also fix that, Lludas. We shall fix everything. Come in. - You came early this time. - Sit down. Why all the mystery? It usually starts on the dance floor, and then... We have to talk in private. In private? That's why the little boy from Europe didn't come? I didn't bring him. You can't see that boy again. - Don't wait for him... - Wait for him? You can't see that boy again. Why are you laughing? Look, one can expect anything from a man... but seeing you as his holy guardian. I'm not such a fool. - There's something more important. - More important? There's something that boy mustn't know. Whatever it costs, he won't talk to you. Whatever it costs. Millionaire of words, huh? Look, I don't take orders from anyone, you understand? And if that boy had anything to do with you? If you want to see a movie about lunatics... round the corner you can see one. That boy is Jarvis Liudas. Jarvis Liudas. Do you understand? Jarvis Liudas! - It's necessary to... - Leave me alone. - Listen to me. - Leave me alone. If Jarvis gets to know that his father and you... You must understand. The disappointment. He thinks he's a man full of virtues. - Leave. - Promise. - Leave. - I won't until you promise. Leave! Leave, leave. Alfredo. Alfredo. Wake up, son. Jarvis called. He said he's not going to the office because he has to go out. - Didn't he say who with? - No. Go and have a shower while I make lunch. No, Mama. I won't have lunch here. But son, last night you said you would. You always leave me alone. I don't understand your schedule, Alfredo. She called her this morning. You can see it was already fixed. An hour ago she came for him. What did the woman look like? I don't know 'cause I didn't meet her. Carmela did. - Call her. - No, she went over to her sister's. And her sister lives in Quilmes. They don't have a telephone there. I would call her but... Hello? Hello? Hello? Open. Open now. Where is he? Where is Jarvis? I don't know. I haven't seen him. - You're lying. - No. He asked you not to tell me anything. I haven't seen him, I swear. Believe me. - Why should I believe you? - You have to believe me. It's important that you believe me. You are Gasper, aren't you? Yes. Gasper. All the times we spoke with Liudas about you. And about Jarvis. Last time you told me everything at once. I'm don't like getting my face slapped. And yesterday you gave me a hard slap. It woke me up. Jarvis existed. I had danced with Jarvis. I had to accept the truth. Liudas would never come back to me. Liudas. He was the only man I loved. I think I loved him since the first night I met him... some months ago. At the Rivoli, they had hired some dancers... from I don't know which part of Europe. I had been working for a while. One night, I noticed a new client. He looked at the dancers in a strange way. His eyes were shining. He was smiling. I sat with him and we chatted for a while. I knew he was a foreigner... and he had gone to see those dancers... because they reminded him of his homeland. No, he wasn't a client. And it was hard for me to treat him like any other client. He invited me to go out on a Sunday afternoon. He took me to the zoo. We had a lot of fun. Do you like it? I like it. Hungarian food. Very nice. I say that I like eating with you. Jasmines. Nobody had done that simple thing for me. Never. To buy me flowers. Liudas was, for me... a completely different man than those I had known before. Soon after... he told me that in Europe he had a wife and two kids. But I didn't care. And I only wanted to be his. Take me away from the night club, Liudas. Take you away from the night club? Can't you leave? Between the dresses, makeup, and the cost of an operation... I owe more than 20,000 pesos. Take me away from the night club. I can't stand it anymore. We'll move together. I'm going to change, Liudas. I have to change. I can't stay there. Elena. I love you very much. You know that. You know it. I've got the money. Liudas. I've got that money... but it's to bring my people from Europe. They're expecting everything from me. Do you understand, Elena? I can't betray that hope. My wife, two kids. You understand them. - What about me? - Elena. I have to rot forever with the men that go to the club. Forever. "My dearest Dad... "will it be much longer until you have all the money... "for us to go to Argentina? "Tell me to leave as soon as you can. "Mom misses you and cries. "Nigrov no longer believes that we will go to Argentina. "I'm studying Agronomy from my books. "I'll help you when I get there, and we will make more money. "We will bring Mom and Gru. "We miss you a lot, Dad. It's so difficult to wait." Forgive me. Forgive what? I've been swindling people. I dragged a good journalist into a dirty business. I needed the money, Elena. And I got it. Money saved a lot of people in Europe. It gave false passports. It bought prison guards. So, I made money as I could. For them, Elena. For them to come. For Jarvis to come. He loved me. He was aware of something terrible. If we stayed together... he wouldn't be able to let me go. And we decided that one night we would say goodbye forever. While we were dancing... he laughed and said funny things. He laughed a lot. I saw he laughed to give me a treat. Because Liudas was sad. And we decided to celebrate our end... like the doomed in the movies do. Our last day, we had champagne. To what could have been. You promised not to say any of those things. Then to you, Elena. You are a good woman. Sometimes I wonder if I have to believe about Jarvis. Why, Elena? You must believe. Trust me. - Do they all believe, Liudas? - My friends do. - Does Gasper trust you? - Of course he does. Gasper believes everything I say. Tell me, isn't he playing dirty? So much kindness doesn't smell fishy? No. Gasper is my partner. He's like my brother. He gave me the highest earnings so I could bring my people over. Why wouldn't he believe about Jarvis? Jarvis, the son that has to come from Europe. Why wouldn't he believe about him. Last night, when I knew about Jarvis... everything ended. I locked myself in here. I locked myself in to remember. I didn't want to see anyone. I didn't want to talk to anyone. They insisted. But I didn't want to talk to anyone. I wanted to be alone... with Liudas. With Liudas. Hello? Hello? Hello? Gasper is my partner. He's like my brother. He gave me the highest earnings so I could bring my people over. Why wouldn't he believe about Jarvis? Why wouldn't he believe about him? I can't keep on. I can't continue hiding it. I killed him. I killed him! I didn't know. I didn't know, I swear. Alfredo, forgive us for not letting you know. No need to explain. It's very clear. - Let's go, Jarvis. - Just to the platform. Tomorrow he'll come for tea. He needs to be strong. I want to talk to your mom, Alfredo. Esther and I. Yes, that is very clear, too. Mom will be pleased. - Shall we? - Let's go. Everything is going fine, Liudas. Mom likes to have us all at home. She is so happy. My sister and your son. They are also happy. I know I'm guilty, Liudas. I should tell everybody everything. But as you can see... I come up with perfect alibis. Everything is fixed in a jiffy. And I want to save myself... not pay for my sin. What would you have done in my place, Liudas? Alfredo! Was my dad here? Yes, one afternoon that... Come! Come and see! This is extraordinary. Bitter, very bitter. That's it. It's grown well. Look, Alfredo. Acacia pignalta. Its bark has a lot of tannin. I sent Dad some seeds to see if it grew here... and it grew. But it's strange. What is strange, Jarvis? Dad didn't follow my instructions properly. He planted them all together and underneath the tree. - Do you have a shovel, Esther? - I'll go for it. I'm going to dig them up and plant them somewhere else. No. - Not now. - Why not? The sooner, the better. We have to take care of them, Alfredo. These plants will be great business for the future. Here. Our future, Esther. Great future with these plants. Alfredo didn't understand what you explained to him. He's always worried about so many things. I'll explain it to him. And also to Dad. What a Dad. He was right about something. He planted the seeds 30 centimeters deep. A little deeper and... - Is that important? - You know very little about plants. At more than one meter deep, any seed dies.
