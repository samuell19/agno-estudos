- [Female] Make mental pictures every day. (dramatic music) - Girls! (hollering) Here ya go, come see our show tonight. Girls. Hi, how are you guys? Hi. (chattering) (dramatic music) - Lemur. - Like the animal? I think this is a big mistake. - What about my 200? - Your 200? - Making a mistake costs just as much as not making it. - They already charged my card. - I don't leave until I get my 200. You stupid son of a bitch. - Let's just call it a night, okay? - $200 just like Lemur. - What is your name, Chipmunk? - Nancy. - Nancy. - Look, give me my fucking money. Loser. - That's all I wanted to know, The Comedy Spot. I'm checking out right now, I just I have to get dressed. Give me a second, this place isn't that bad. It's actually kinda nice. Downtown Vegas gets a bad rep man. I know it's gonna be gorgeous. That doesn't make this place a dump, okay? Comedy Spot, our hotel. Roger out, mother fucker. - It's just my husband. No, stop it. Yeah and you were drunk then too. - I'll let you know... - Shh, stop not here! - I paid per minute. - Really? - Mm-hm. - Stop it! No, stop. Please. - Hey, if I'm so allergic, why do you keep marrying me to all my female friends? - Because if snatch is camouflaged, marriage is invisibility. You're a coward. Hence. - Fuck you. - You know, Jesus tried to get a room here in the wee hours, tossed three nails on the front desk. - Did he put me up for the night? It's older than Mt. Olympus. - Wait for the laughs. - Hand jobs with holes in his hands? - Yeah, well executing queers wouldn't be Uganda's claim to fame if Bible-thumpers were extinct. - So go after it with some taste. - Per Ava. - There's worse things than giving a shit about something. - Unless maybe it's Judeo-Christian fascism. - Which she would despise as much as anyone. - A dual conversion. From secular cynicism and sodomy, to the holy forgiveness, smack dab between her legs. Ah-la. - Fuck you again. - You looked conjugal as hell at the funeral. Arm and arm, before the dirt even hit the box. - Who could replace Mike. Who's even trying? - Who died literally in the closet? - [Nathaniel] Uh, waitress? - You think you're the first fag to pull down a pair of panties to prove how normal you are? - What do you want? - [Comic] Just because you can, doesn't mean you want to. - Forget it. - Enough with the gynecology. It's not a pap smear, sweetie. I want that bonus. I'm not gonna let you down. - Fuck me if Rachel Maddow has (mumbles) used it. Uganda, be kidding me, my ass, it's every where. - Fundraisers are great. But maybe the persecution is closer to home. You on you. - It's couple, husband, wife. - Who? - This fucking idiot, drunk. Messin' around with his wife and it just keeps getting creepier 'cause he looks so stupid. And I'm like, why is she with him? He's like inching up her skirt. And he called her fly paper. His perfectly normal, perfectly hot wife to die for. - What the fuck was it downtown or something? - I heard junk with something he couldn't get out of. - What were they fighting about? The couple? Eh, you know what, never mind. They're misery quotient. Like all married couples. It's a sign, I'm telling you, you're no switch hitter. - Tell that to these. - I don't normally speak to the heavens as you can probably tell. - The hooker from last night. - Midnight cowboy, maybe, cowgirl, uh-uh. - Hey, if I'm so allergic, why do you keep marrying me to all my female friends? - Ah, the little engine that could. - You forgot something. - Yeah, you're gonna wanna keep those. So. Did I earn a little something, teensy-weensy extra? - With your bonuses? I mean, I charged the credit card for two grand. - So, a little itsy-bitsy extra? For throwing your chi all over the fucking room. - I haven't done a play since high school. Yeah but you shouldn't make commitments for other people, even Ava. Hold on, I have another call. Ava? Hold on, I'm on the phone with my mom. Mom, I gotta go, it's her. What's up? (knocking) - Ta-da! I wanted to see your show tonight. Hi. And believe me, it was a pain, the flight was ridiculous. I saw the posters and ducked my head in the lounge. It's a cute, cozy little venue. We don't have to leave early, early in the morning, do we, say we don't. We're three sheets, man. Me, you and fucked up it. She says pushing that (mumbles) all there was to it. All over again. Stop looking at me like I'm a specimen. - I'm not. - You always are looking at me like I'm some sort of a specimen. And now, you're working up to say, about last night. - Shouldn't I? - You shouldn't. - What are we even doing here? - Fine, let's change and go then. - I wanted them to tone it down. For people like you and not specifically you but... - Like me? So if you were bigger than I don't know, the Grand Canyon, would it can't be a little lounge show in Vegas really matter? Love you, jackass. - Executing them is damn extreme. - A little bit? - You think? You know it'll do you good to get away from those screwballs in California for awhile. - I don't mean to be rude here... - You know, not that we don't have a few of our own. - I'm trying to get my lines down here. - Let's see what good old Jesus H has to say about it. Who's Bart? There's a gospel according to Bart? - Can I have that back? - Happened to me in Saigon. Thought he was just a good buddy. - The dog needs a walk, Nathaniel. - They take it hard, too. The whole world's against me, that sort of thing. - Or commit suicide. - Nathaniel. - What? - Do you have any sense? I'll go with you. - Where? - Does anybody hear a word I say? We're walking the dog. Don't listen to him. - Enjoying the wrestling? Brutus will take down Julius, I promise you. Look how he goes after his legs. Are you from these parts? - I'm from Caesarea, originally Rome. - Romans rule the world, eh? Invariable handsome, too. - You're pretty handsome yourself. - In need of a massage. - 'Kay, let's flip it. Nathaniel, you're Bart, from where we left off. - Would you like to visit my place overlooking the Sea of Tiberius? - It's tempting, I prefer my own. Those of circumcision. - Why, my mother was a Jew. She had me done on the eighth day after my birth. - Then you most definitely have my permission to enter my inner sanctum. (laughing) - My little Betsy-wetsy. - Mr. Waite. Mr. Can't wait. You're gonna love it. - I should for $1800 a month. Hey, a girl needs a little help now and again. That's okay. - Like you do sometimes? - [Mr. Waite] A little blue pill? - That little blue pill. - Hey, a little extra starch never hurt a guy. (laughing) Love you, baby. I guess, it's pretty much like what you do out there in the smog, producing, I mean a team's a team, right? - I'm thinking about asking and I know it. - Your mom told me. - Mom doesn't know. - Entertainment law. - Well, yeah, but it's something else. - Oh look at this son of a bitch. That's all I need is OSHA up my ass with a flashlight. - I'm thinking about asking Ava to marry me. - Oh, thank God. I mean, she's beautiful. I wouldn't want you to let that get away. Oh seriously, I'm gonna fire this cocksucker. (whistling) - Your shirt's unbuttoned. - Bring her to lunch. - This is bullshit, there are plenty of other secretaries at the real offices. - This is (mumbles). - (mumbles) - Kinda big for a car. - [Nathaniel] I don't know, a backhoe? - [Ava] With these floors? Seriously, what is this place? - See, there's nothing fucking here. - Be careful. Okay, pull the car over now. What is going on with you? - I saw him the other day. He couldn't keep his hands off of her. - Does your mother know? Maybe you should let me drive. Maybe you should call. Cancel, I don't know, make something up. Was I supposed to turn? (mumbles) - So. - So. - So. - Nathaniel says you're active in your church. - I am. - I'm a hypocrite myself, like most people. But, I like that forgiveness angle. - That's important. - Linguistics, so what do you want to be when you grow up? - Well I studied poly sci in undergrad. - Where? - UW. - Nathaniel. - UW, what do you care? - [Hostess] Hey how are you guys doing today? - Thanks. - Your waitress will be with you in just a minute. - Thank you. Yup, University of Washington. Big mystery why I came back AZ State for my doc work. I love Seattle. - I need my sunshine. - I miss the ocean. - So maybe as your prof for some withered up old chicken hawk in congress, something like that. - You don't have to tell me about chicken shit politicians. You ever hear of the Battle of Hue? Perfume River. It was in a place not called Disneyland. 1968. - [Nathaniel] Dad. - No silver spoons tucked in my yap either. I was a jarhead. I didn't have a University of Southern California theatrical background. - What do you want me to do then, nothing? In honor of what I know you did? - Yeah, that was me a lot. I damn well know that better than most. But those VC, they were some monster mother fuckers themselves. - Dad. - While those whorey old bureaucrats you're talking about sip cocktails, told one another about how they nailed down deferments for their spoiled brats. Hemming and hauling about etiquette of the lawless lunatic bullshit they were about to unleash in Cambodia and Laos. - I shouldn't have been so flippant. - Par for the course nowadays though. New American century and all that. Self perpetuating bullshit for fun and profit. - End times, huh? - He's packing his kid's bags for round two, eh? - You could have water boated me instead I guess. Hi, I'm Bart, the gay apostle. I'm from Canaan, used to spend almost all my time when I wasn't working in a Roman bathhouse in Tiberias on the Sea of Galilee. First I'd like to mention I'm a Jew and had sex with good looking men for most, good looking men most every day. Definitely on weekends. I used to go to a gym to see Greco-Roman wrestlers. One thing would lead to another and I'd find myself on my back, the happy recipient of much genetic batter. Being a Jew, I'd only allow the properly sniffed. The unopened collar of the Gentile flesh was my only line of resistance. I was bothered for the tourists seemed to forbid the very things I accepted nightly. What was I to do? Well a man comes up to me, no more than 30, I'd say and says to me and this other guy, "Come follow me and I'll make you fishers of men." How could I refuse pulling men from the sea? Especially if they're good looking. - I don't see that. - My addition. - Keep it. Where is our esteemed director? - [Nathaniel] Any minute. - Congratulations. Bart. Nathaniel. - [Nathaniel] Thank you. - And playing our Lord and Savior isn't exactly second best. - I'm event planning the rapture with Nathaniel here. Someone who has some experience in the field. - Off with your clothes, serpent lover! - Yikes. - Blessed are the poor in spirit. - I am poor in spirit. - For theirs is the kingdom of heaven. - I hang out at bathhouses after all. - Blessed are those who mourn. - I mourn all right, even in the steam. - For they will be comforted. - Because I just don't feel right about it. - What about the meek? Those who serve coffee? - They will inherit the earth, darling. - I will meekly follow this man where ever he goes and do whatever he tells me to do as best I can. - Hand me my coffee then. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be filled. - [Nathaniel] Yes, I am starved and thirsty. - Blessed are the peacemakers, for they... - Hold on. What about the merciful? - Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy. - And that's where you give Bart the look like you're gonna interrupt me again? If we don't include his words about lust, we should at least include the business about anger, even if you call your brother a fool, et cetera. - I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Anyone who says to his brother raca will face Sanhedrin, but anyone who says you fool, will be subject to the fire of hell. - I'm not exactly up on my scripture. What is raca? - Oh, worthless, blockhead. - And Sanhedrin? - Judges all across Israel. So we include Matt 5:22, I added, 5:43, 45... - Slow down, slow down. - Matthew? - Mm-hm, you have heard that it was said, you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy, but I say to you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you so you may be sons of your father who is in heaven. And here's where I jumped to 5:48. You therefore must be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect. - Then what do you do? With the word of God. - Where to go. - You go to 5:20, for I tell you unless you're righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. - I was gonna run it by you. Maybe have one of the disciples say something like, "Hey guy, that's absolutely impossible for anybody to do. "Who could be more righteous than the most righteous "people on earth?" - I like it because it's exactly the point. Impossible standards. That's why they need him. - Maybe throw in 2 Corinthians, for our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin. So that in him we may become the righteousness of God. - Are we boring you? - Sorry about that. - Take five, minions. - [Female] Anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. (dramatic music drowns out speaker) - Throwing your chi all over the fucking room. - Slow down, slow down. - [Hooker] Just a little itsy-bitsy extra. - Yeah. - [Venus] You're the one who called. - Venus, whatever your name is. Whatever your name is. - [Lemur] What about my 200? - [Nathaniel] Girls and your fucking (mumbles). - Window. (mumbles) French for, perfectly trimmed, sweet smelling, window. You stupid son of a bitch. (chattering) - I thought I heard someone come in. (chattering) Nathaniel. - We hate each other, remember? - We do, don't we? Your father had a meeting at (mumbles) anyway. So he'll meet you at the restaurant. So he'll meet you at the restaurant. - Why didn't you just call me? - Well, maybe I just wanted to meet the lucky girl. - Perfect, let's go. - You got an hour. - Excuse him. Really nice to meet you. - Would you at least have him call me? - What the hell was all that about? Nathaniel? - What? - Why am I such a lucky girl? Be careful. - Stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has set us free. And do not be entangled again with the yoke of bondage. - Leviticus 19:13 if a man lies with another male, he is creating abomination, and their death shall be on them alone. Period! - You want to fuck my guy? His little brother. You picked the two wrong guys to dance with tonight, didn't you? They would have killed you, except... Except for what? Except for me. - I'm a worm, not a man. Scorned by men and despised by the people. All who see me mock me. They hurl insults, shaking their heads. - Ava? - Roaring lions tearing their prey apart. Their mouths wide against it. - Don't. - I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint. (cat screeching) (gasping) - Ah swath of breeze feels good against our unencumbered genitalia, it is not pungent or nasty to us in any way at this point. - Sure does. How about pick some berries? - 'Kay, love you. - Love you, too. - You must not eat from any trees in this garden. My ass. - We may eat from trees in the garden, just not the tree in the middle, or touch it. Or else we'll die. - You will not surely die. For God knows that when you eat of it, your eyes will be opened. And you will be like God, knowing good and evil. - When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food, and pleasing to the eye and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. The eyes of both were opened and they realized that they were naked. - What on earth is that Cyclopean serpent dangling above it's own two eggs? It's vertical eye and their slit. - What on earth is that voluptuous slice of vulgarity? That man eating abyss? - Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree I commanded you not to eat from? - This bitch, she gave me some fruit and I ate it. I didn't know what it was. - What is this you've done? - I was deceived, plain and simple. By a comely entity, and it did have two horns. - Well, you'll bleed by the month from what is now a curse you straddle and I shall greatly increase your pains during childbirth. Your desire will be nothing for yourself, but everything for the pleasure of man. And he will rule over you. - Shit. - And you, oh, you will be relentlessly in tuned to this fold of flesh by which he is cursed. Able to see her only relative to it. The fruit hung before her heart shall be a distraction as opaque as their milk. Forever camouflaging it's pulse. Your intentions will never be more than the quenchless aim of the divining rod I hereby perpetually engorge. The middle of your (mumbles) forever driven at her loins. - All right, good. But, actually, nevermind. - Yeah, yeah, and number two, I wanna talk to you about and I want to talk to you about a raise. No. I don't mean like a boner, I mean like something you can slip in your pocketbook. Yeah, for real... (doorbell chiming) Yeah. I know. Holy shit. - Mr. Waite. - Hey, I'm gonna call ya back baby. Yeah. My niece. - Is Nathaniel, we were gonna take a dip. - Yeah, come on in then. - Is he here? - He's walking the dog with the old lady. But you can come in. - Are they at the park? - I don't know where they are. - I'm just gonna go meet them there. Thanks. - Suit yourself. - It's you judging your father, not me. And it's you condemning yourself. Not anybody else. - Your dad. All of us has attributes, whether you say it doesn't or not. Wouldn't it be great to just open up no matter what? You call it on the dance floor, presumptuous. That's what I've longed for my whole life. Be presumptuous. To have faith. You can't not presume, negation wants as much as my starry-eyed conjecture. Isn't that something else your over amped pompous vocabulary called it on the dance floor? - High school, Ava. - But are you anymore open? - How much intolerance should tolerance but up with? - I've been tolerant now? - It all sounds very nice theoretically. But by the book it's judgemental as hell. Look at the text of the play we're in. As liberal as it is. What do you believe? - The whole nine yards. - You can't possibly. - Why is that? - [Pastor] We need to get those flyers out to the congregation with our need for apostles. - [Female] Will do. - Well, I did not lay with my life until our wedding night. So I am the greatest. - I made love to a couple whores, but I gave each of them a beautiful pair of sandals. And I gave one of them my cloak because her naked body was getting cold. Aren't I wonderful? Jesus said that we should give our cloak also. - I killed a Roman tax collector to help the Messiah release us from the bondage of this Roman oppression. - I am a tax collector and I take offense to that. I did not cheat anybody and only took what were lawful taxes. - Just be thankful that I did not murder you, too. - Well, I have not had sex with any human beings at all. I only lay with goats and sheep, and so I must be the greatest. - I saw a one legged whore and gave her two dollars, as an act of kindness. And, I did not beseech her rank mouth to suck me off. - That is no good, you cannot have rewards in heaven for that because you just told us. - I am letting my light shine before men. - When you give or pray you're supposed to be quiet about it. - I think Judas Iscariot is the greatest. He is our master and trusted him with the money box. - But he steals from the money box. - Judge not lest you be judged. - Yeah, we were a bunch of selfish losers with self esteem problems. We thought we were all in on a good thing to be hanging out with Jesus because he was gonna be our next king on the throne of David. He was gonna kick the Romans out of Israel. We could probably be his cabinet secretaries. - Then we got Mother of Zebedee's sons and all that. Grant them one of these two sons of mine, (mumbles) said sure and the other left, blah blah blah. Jesus, you know that. - Do you know that the rulers of the Gentiles lorded over them? Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant and whoever wants to be first must be your slave. Just as the son of man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many. - If I give my life for the sake of others, I am truly great. - You are the lowest of the lows. You are a gay bottom, probably a diseased ass at a bathhouse. How can anything good come from you? - Did you hear about that queer Crooner, we stoned to death for that? May I tally the stoning of this Kurt, for that was his name. May the heavens tally it up to me, the greatest for having participated in his torture and death. - Just be thankful we are keeping you alive. If it were not for Jesus, we would stone you to death too. - Why does not Jesus fulfill the law and ask us to stone you to death, you faggot? - Scum. - Get out of here. We do not want you lusting after us. - Yeah, we are getting ready for bed, you faggot. - As a father who's loved me, so have I loved you. If you obey my commands, you will remain in my love. Just as I have obeyed my father's commands and remain in his love. I have told you this so that my joy may be in you. And that your joy may be complete. - So what did I do? I've obeyed him. At least I try to obey him. It's very very hard, I'm constantly tempted. Two weeks later I meet a man at the gym who gives me a sack of silver. I go to his house thinking that I will just kiss him a little bit, and give him a massage. I failed miserably. He ends up poking me and afterwards I feel like a runny egg sandwich, cold and sulfuric. You couldn't tell how serious it was just by looking at him, but when his kidneys go, he's not gonna do dialysis. - You should go. - There's this play I got roped into. - You hate it. - I'm having fun. - I wish you would have stuck with acting. - You would have married me. - Definitely. Should have brought my own tent. - It's like my leg is stuck, I'm just howling for a knife. - Where do you aim them these howls? - Pondering this. Nathaniel was enlightened. Overlooking the (mumbles) dirt of his master's work. - You think you are so smart. - I'm the first to admit how stupid. - Ah, second. You're trying to change who you are. And not just because the world becomes so much simpler with a woman, but maybe sincerely. But it's on a different level that I won't. My church isn't a farse to me. It's not a contradiction. Not peeking out all trembly and diffident. And that's my sole excuse for loving something bigger and better than myself. Hide and seek? Whoever lives by the truth comes into the light. So if he's seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God. But you don't want to hear that, right? Not from me. Because I'm your projection. The real me spills off the screen. All this light comes into the world but men love darkness. Why? It's not me who's hiding, Nathaniel, it's you. When? - [Nathaniel] Vegas. - Who do you even know in Vegas? Did you do what I think you did? I can't believe it, to prove it's physically possible? You're just like you're willing to exploit her, some poor fool would do anything for money. Some poor prostitute? - Listen, she was anything but poor, okay? - Just like you're willing to exploit her, you're willing to exploit me? For how I feel about you? And for what? A man you don't respect, who betrays your mother how many times a week with her? That secretary thinks we're getting married, doesn't she? Because that's what your father thinks, isn't it? Do you think you're a sin or something? Like I can absolve you? - I don't respond to that word, Ava, sin. - Well I do. - And yet you came up here with me. And now you're lying here next to me. Isn't that just as much a sin, as the fucking follow through? - You are a gay man. - [Man] But I am a whore despised by the people. All who see me, mock me. They hurl insults, shaking their heads. - He trusts in the Lord, let the Lord rescue him! Let him deliver him since he delights in him. - Yet, you brought me out of the womb and made me trust in you even at my mother's breast. From birth I was cast upon you. From my mother's womb you have been my God. Do not be far from me. For trouble is near and there is no one to help. - Okay, good. (laughing) (hollering) - Look, just go pee in the ocean. - Let's go. - Let's just walk right through them, all right? - You'll get the shit beat out of you, okay? (laughing) - Fucking serious? You like that? - [Man] Pierce my hands and my feet, thus display all I know, people stare and gloat. They divide my garments among them. (speaker trailing off) - Hey asshole! - What's with that? - I can't believe he did that. - Don't move. Stop! Waiter, waiter! - I'm not trying to be what I'm not. But I don't want what I am to be everything either. - [Nathaniel] We should do something. - What like it's a birthday? It's not a birthday. - But it is an anniversary. - A beating is nothing to celebrate. - Surviving it is. - You mean not killing myself? - That's one way of putting it, yeah. That's their point, to make you loathe yourself, right? - An act of redundance. I asked what the most important thing is and he said all sagacious as shit, being the scintillating shrink my fagophobic mother says he is, intimacy. That's an embarrassment, what's left. - Does this embarrass you? - The San Fernando Valley does. - Then why are we still here? - Because over the hills and fagging away is what I almost got killed for. - Look I wouldn't call lying in my arms, just because you put the Hollywood Hills in between. What's changed? Your idea of West Hollywood is haunted by what happened. - The Himalayas wouldn't be enough between here and there. What happened. Or body and soul, maybe that's what I want a mountain in between. I wish she hadn't been there. - She? - And all the woe that moved him so that he'd gave that bitter cry, the wild regrets and the bloody sweats none knew so well as I. For he who lives more lives than one, more deaths than one must die. - So who's being fed to the lions tonight? What fag shudders this very hour at the roaring crowd? What foul little Mexican? What never not suspicious looking Muslim. - And thus we rust life's chain. Degraded and alone and some in curse and some in weep, and some may make no moan. - I won't be able to afford the madness. - Yes, you will. - We'll make sure of it. - And full blown AIDS as they spectacularly call it. Oh, like the plumage of a peacock, we'll in raid self rapturously across my fucked up subsistence. The miasma of my inspiration. - Of course. - May I have some? - And a matter of pailful focus gentlemen. Matter of being earnest. The importance of (laughing). - You can't just take people's food like that, Mike. - Mmmm. Mm-hmm. - You can't just... (moaning) It's not right, you can't just... (chuckling) - I will declare your name to my brothers. In the congregation I will praise you. You who fear the Lord, praise him, all you descendants of Jacob, honor him, revere him all you descendants of Israel. For he is not despised or disdained the suffering of the afflicted woman. He has not hidden his face from him but has listened to his cry for help. From you comes the demon of my praise in the greatest symbol. Before those who fear you, will I fulfill my vows. The poor will eat and be satisfied. They who seek the Lord will praise him. May your heart live forever. All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the Lord. And all the families of the nations will bow down before him for dominion belongs to the Lord and he rules over the nations. - Get ready. - All the rich of the earth will feast in worship. All who go down to the dust will kneel down before him. Those who cannot keep themselves alive, posterity will serve him, future generations will be told about the Lord. They will proclaim his righteousness to a people yet unborn. For he has done it. - Ready back there? - Let's do it. We did not remember those passages written centuries before the death of Jesus. We are more than 108 Old Testament prophecies about the first coming. We did not consider or remember. Zechariah describing Judas' betrayal. With 30 pieces of silver. - Yes. - Sorry. - Which is worse? Pretending I'll suffice? The denial, or forgiving everyone and everything except yourself? And religion, of course. You can ridicule how I make sense of things, but I'm not gonna not be friends with someone I love and you know that. You used that. I'm not your specimen. - Would you stop saying that? - Classic reaction formation. I produce your anxiety. Women do, and you overcompensate to hide it. - Brush up on your psychology. A reaction formation isn't... (hand smacking) - Complicating matters, I love what you hate. Everything that holds up the steeple out there. - Not buying a dog eared version of resurrection folklore. - See? Stop making fun of what just might be my very essence. - Who's making fun? - You do. - How about deconstruct? - Fine, don't. - Then don't try to convert me. - With my body or my church? - I guess we should get back to rehearsal. - [Lowboy] Don't be dissin' Jon (mumbles) on my watch. - Who's dissin' the guy? Who do I look like? Pauly fuckin' Kale, I never dissed the guy once in my life. I love the guy, I don't know why you think I'm always dissin' the guy. - Say my name, one time, mother fucker. I never heard you say Lowboy not one mother fucking time. - Lowboy. - That's how you're gonna say it? - How the hell am I supposed to say it? - Lowboy. - Lowboy. What the fuck ever man. - I, your Lord and teacher have washed your feet. You also should wash one another's feet. I have set an example that you should do as I have done for you, I tell you the truth. No servant is greater than his master. Nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. Now that you know these things, you'll be blessed if you do them. (cell phone buzzing) I'm not referring to all of you. I know those I have chosen. But this is to fulfill the scripture. He who shares my bread has lifted up his heel against it. I am telling you now before it happens so that when it does happen, you'll believe that I am he. I tell you the truth. Whoever accepts anyone I send, accepts me and whoever accepts me, accepts the one who sent me. I tell you the truth. One of you is going to betray me. - Simon Peter elbows John, asking which one he means. John, Lord, who is it? - It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread. When I have dipped it in the dish. - Judas takes the bread, (mumbles) enters, and you say... - What you are about to do, do quickly. - Judas is off the races. - Now is the son of man glorified and God is glorified in him. - Now his kidneys. Well, you know the thing of it is, yeah he looks sick. But basically like you and me. Not the usual emaciation associated with fag come-up-ants. There just hasn't been time. How's the fur burger? - I'm coming out there. - Tell that mixed up mother fucker that there's hemorrhoids bigger than that bitch's (mumbles). - That Lowboy? - He never gonna learn how to quell that little (mumbles) bastard either. And the white shit at the tip of your tongue don't know what to do with. - Upstage my ass with my own material? - Smack me mother fucker. - Did he just say what I think he said? - Your material, my ass. And think about that shit next time you downtown on that little Christian bitch. - See ya later. - I'm going there to prepare a place for you. If I'm going to prepare a place for you, I'll come back and take you with me so you may be where I am. You know the way to where I'm going. - What is it? - Your friend called, that comic. - Great. He's not the most circumspect guy I know. - Is that what a comic should be? - Mutual friend isn't doing too well. - That's what he said. - He shouldn't have called here. - Why? He told me more about that fundraiser. Were you afraid to? - You sound like Ava. - She enjoyed the show, didn't she? - I just didn't think to tell you. - As a matter of fact you did. But you said it was a fundraiser for sick comics. - He's a sick comic all right. - Then I wonder if you're ashamed on some level. - Money is essentially being raised to rescue them from red, white and blue religion. And what's fueled it over there. Can you accept why the funds are needed? - Using God as a Trojan horse isn't my cup of tea if that's what you're trying to equate. It's as Orwellian in my book as yours. Love and acceptance for hate and division. The ins and outs of my spirituality, I'm willing to discuss, Nathaniel, I just want to one day hear my son possibly overcome his own worst enemy. Your friend, Mike, he couldn't. - Tell your friend, Lee, that some stranger is praying for him back in Scottsdale. And learn your lines. Or we'll crucify you upside down on Monday. (chattering) - Hey. Come on, let's go see that hydrocodone drinking mother fucker. - [Nathaniel] Really? - Do I have a blow job story for you. - Don't even start, bitch, all right? - Oh, I'm sorry, my freshly heterosexual Christian man playing an apostle no less. This guy had the cutest little goatee. Tickled, ah! Just like the lettuce on a pink taco. - Like you would fuckin' know. Let's talk some Lowboy, where is he? I want him at least (mumbles). - Those fucking oral transmucosal Fentanyl lollipops he gets in TJ, that's where the fuck Lowboy is. Sittin' on his sweet, sweet, back, oh! (mumbles) - You know what, look at this guy, Nick Nolte. (laughing) Oh hell. (mumbles) - [Nathaniel] So what did you do with your 30 pieces of silver, Judas? - And that's supposed to mean what? Now that you're the expert on Arcane biblical bullshit? - You called the house phone because you're nosy and you couldn't resist the opportunity to show off how nosy you fuckin' are. - I'm supposed to know the fucking maze that is your life? Every twist and turn, I am not the bitch of your self reproach, bitch, okay? Like the details of the fundraiser and what the fuck the money's for. That's off limits to your mother. - The lines are one thing, my father is another. I'll take the Colosseum over him any... - I wasn't talking to your father, was I? - [Nathaniel] Mother fucker, please. - I dreamt of a flagstone path. And tall wild grass. Swaying like water 'cause maybe Tarkovski would see it. One cool flat slab at a time. - Who's Tarkovski? - It's the filmmaker, stupid. - Okay, fuck the two of you in like a 1970s bathhouse gang bang kinda way. Enough with the stupid already. - Moans and groans, rising and staying. As spooky as fog. Brant (coughs) stokers got nothin' on this hungry fag. I take all comers. Forever be mine. I'm an infected fag. I'm an infected fag, stupid. - [Nathaniel] Like a vampire. - Okay, you're so frickin' funny you do the show tonight. - [Nathaniel] You know what, it doesn't even fuckin' matter. - Okay, let me ask you something. What if, way back in old fucked up day, we down in Alabama way, what if you could fake white with just one kiss? I mean who wants to bring this shit storm on us anyway? Who's willing to suffer shit, if we don't have to? - The star of the play I got roped into. - Oh don't get me started, you transmogrified bent prick. - Nathaniel, Nathaniel! - [Nathaniel] Ready. - God, how dare you take my son. My son was good. One of the Christians. If you're real as this Jesus is, bring someone, to tell me about him. And why this. - Sir, I'm sorry for your loss and I offer my condolences. Have seen any soldiers about? - This is my son, God killed him for my sin. - I do not believe that, sir. - If you knew my sin, you would. - God does not punish people in that way. - My sin is heavy. I betrayed my wife with a man. (mumbles) - The king will compensate you for your losses, sir. He's only interested in killing Christians. - My son was a Christian. I am a brother to the king. - Your honor, we are so sorry, we must go. We're chasing the one named Bart. He is perverting the country with this new religion. Let us go in that direction. - Your dead son has to pee. (whispering) - How can I receive your gift? I'm not like Bart, whose glorious deeds shine like the son. I've never known him to sin. There are 12 cities in Armenia. Filled with people that love you and love each other. All because of him. My family with the exception of my brother, the king, have all changed for the better because of him. How could you love me? How could you love, how could you love a wicked man like me? If that's possible, if that is possible for you to love a man like, then please, bring Bart back. - Okay, again! Let's shave some lines. Ava? Honey? - I went camping with Nathaniel. - Oh. - Why? Soldiers would kill me if I go back. However, if it is your will, yes, all we, like sheep have gone astray, we've turned everyone into his own way. For with certain song, Isaiah. Of course. (mumbles) for our transgressions, he was crushed for our inequities. Upon him was the chastised (mumbles) peace. With his stripes (mumbles). So moved. - The backseat threw us apart, like the car was tumbling end over end, not parked. In high school, I mean. And then Vegas, it wasn't, it wasn't just the booze. It's who he is. Who he's trying to hide from. Behind my skirt. All over again. And then the trauma of losing Mike like that. I don't know, it sent him backwards. Summer between semesters, it wasn't like this. I mean he was out in West Hollywood. To everyone. Except his parents. - What is even most despised most in our time, men attaching themselves to men. Cannot separate me from the love of God. I was celibate for many years. With the apostle Paul in order to give a gift back to God for the sacrifice of my (mumbles). Jesus said that if you can remain celibate and unmarried, the sake of the kingdom of God then you should remain celibate and unmarried. He also said that not everyone can accept this word about celibacy. You never know how long we have on this earth. And it is God's only provision for sin, whom you receive the Lord. It was the will of the Lord to crush is earned. To put him to grief, his soul's an offering for guilt. He bore the sin of many bearing their inequities so as to make many to be accounted righteous. And though he was brought as a lamb to the slaughter, as a sheep before the shears is gone. Opening not his mouth as he was cut off from the land of the living (mumbles). - Lord, I have sinned against you and I need you. Open the door of my existence and I receive you as my savior and my Lord. Please take control of my life. Take control of my life and make me the person that I should be. I'm not feeling it. - After the prayer, let's have Theofilis ask something like, how do I know I actually have eternal life? - Bart references 1 John 5:11, 12, 13. This I write to you, who believe in the name of the son of God, and who will know you have life eternal. - Also, while we're on it, you gave me a note on this from the scripture to the Romans. The free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord, blah, blah, blah. And just a sec, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him up from the dead... - Enter (mumbles) and what not. - What the hell is this? You damn well better not be doing to my brother what I think you're doing. - I'm doing what I have done with thousands of men. - We have our own God, you son of a bitch. - I'm preparing this man for reality. - Listen up, let me tell you a little something about reality. You put up a sacrifice right here and right now, to Astaroth, the one the only, our God. Or start pissing your robe, my brother. - I would would rather brand red hot to my testimony upon my bare back. - Whip the shit out of him with rods. I want him on the cross upside down. His big mouth where is balls should be. And your blade will be patient. Flay him as you would lay with your lover. Tenderly, landerously, and his screams shall reap throughout Armenia, the greater, and the one dozen cities he's tried to pervert with his tongue. And I want his head for my mantle piece. - Yeah! All right. That's it. Monday, tech week, costumes, sets, the whole nine yards. - Pizza didn't arrive? - Called it in? - Like an hour ago. - Again with the pizza! Off with their gown at once! 30 lashes! (laughing) (mumbles) - You do? - Yeah, makes my hairs stick down and get all itchy. At least that's how I remember it. - Is the point winning? Were you winning (mumbles) in the closet? Is that winning? (mumbles) like your blanket. And what you did, it's bright during the day, but haunts him at night. - [Mike] Who he is, mostly. - Like it didn't haunt you, who you are? - I didn't write vagina though, did I? Growing his beard, again, like in high school. - And is the point winning? Were you winning, when you took that cat in the closet? Was that winning? - If we live for decades in ultimately die of natural causes, even then begging for more everyday suffering. It wins. It's the only way I know of that whatever this is, that it loses. Nah. - Not so much. That's how he felt about it, too. Shit, here he comes. - [Female] God has given us eternal life. This life is his son. Those who have the son, have eternal life. Those who do not have the son, do not have eternal life. - [Nathaniel] It all sounds very mysterious. But by the book, it's judgemental as hell. - I'm the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me will live, even though he dies. And whoever lives and believes in me, will never die. - [Female] This I write to you, who believe in the name, the son of God and who will know you have life eternal. - Sorry about the charcoal. - It's a little bit bigger than just that. - You were sure pretty made about it though. - If it hadn't rained, it wouldn't have mattered. - A human sacrifice over something so trivial makes it worse. - I just got home with the charcoal and put it on the table. I was so pissed off at you. I just wanted to keep ragging on you. But I couldn't find you, so I put the steaks on and sat by myself. The clouds started rolling in, and I was still at that table all by myself. I even ate your cold steak. Then it started raining like the day before. Cats, rats and dogs. I had to put the cover on the barbecue. It's the only reason why I went back inside. Inside that closet. For a jacket. - Probably myself back up the asshole pushed me out. And our fight over the charcoal getting wet. - Love the Lord your God with all of your heart, and all of your soul and all of your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. - Help me. - Sorry? - How's the bag? - Honestly, it's not looking good, you're not peeing worth a damn. - Open the door, at the blazing son of God arise up. My light has illuminating fire and set aglow. These last drops of what has been a bitter lemon. Make upon a furrow brow, these last hours, a sweet heat. A perspiration of perpetual peace. Venus, making your lust less harmful to your soul. - Yeah, you're gonna want those. - And you think likewise. - What? - A father betraying his family. More sinful than a mother not holding him accountable. - What did you just say? - A man choking his wife in the neon jungle. More sinful than a man using Ava for his own purposes. - Stop. - Her body's a steep challenge. Your love not exactly a fucking ski lift. If she were stark naked before you, what sin? Perform a question mark. What more? Your gape would be as lustless as a child before it's own wet origins in the shower. - Not the best analogy given that his orientation is an inoculation against a virulent strain of Oedipus. - Queers are queers because they don't want to accidentally fuck their mothers? Shit. - You did fuck your mother. - Chew up and swallow my balls, skid mark, water park, basement sand paper soft ass white... - What do you have when you take away the genes? - Snail without antlers? Peeking out under the hood. - [Comic] Take away the genes. - Strands of nucleic acid without identity. - [Comic] A curious notch. - Look. - Put that mother fuckin' thing away, girl. - Look. - I'm on my death bed here guys. If you're gonna play doctor... - [Ava] Look! - Let's put this fucker on wheels, what do ya say? - Would it be okay? - It will be beautiful. - Ready? Okay. (tea pot squealing) (eerie music)
