RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM All right, great job, everybody. Two more. Just two more, Julia? I've barely even broken a sweat. Okay then, three more. Except for my pregnant moms, you can begin stretching. Thank god. Three, two, one... Let's hold, arms up. And breathe. All right, everybody, you're done. Shake it off. Great work. I'll see you all next week, and remember what I always say, fit bodies pre-baby make fit mommies with baby. Great work. - Good work, sis. - Thanks. Apparently, not as good as the keener. I mean, seriously, who gets back to a size two three months after giving birth? Not me, that's for sure. You class always works, Julia, wipes us both out. Do you mind? Joey's got a bit of a greener. Yeah. You okay? Yeah. Just some false contractions. How do you know the difference? Because both my kids came 10 days late, and this one ain't comin' out early either. Later, skaters. Hey, so are you coming over tonight? I'm making veggie tacos. I love having a domestic sister. I know, I know. All right, I'll see you later. Hey, Julia, can you watch baby Abby while I go freshen up? Sure. Thanks. Bye, sweetie. Cute shoes. Too bad you can't walk in them yet? Okay. Abby? Abby! Hey, have you seen a baby? Cute, little pink sparkly shoes? Abby! Here, girl! Abby! Worms? Worms? My Abby ate worms? You can't text when you're babysitting, Julia. It's like malpractice for babysitters. It was an accident. Texting isn't an accident. Well, how was I she could crawl that fast? Besides, the doctor said she can just poop the bugs out. "Feeding your unborn child"? Come on, Gwen, babies can't taste anything. The book says that she'll grow a taste for whatever I eat. Then it's going to love chips. What? No, no, I'm off all junk food. This is just a, you know, little "hold me over." Okay, sure. Hello! Can you hear me in there? It's like hearing underwater. You know what? Check this out. Hello! On your ear, Jules. Can you hear the heartbeat? Yeah. That's so cool. Speaking of cool, Phil and I have decided we're going to go through with the water birth. You know, just so the baby feels a little more natural when it comes out. A water birth? What is that, like, you have the baby in a bathtub or something? No, in the pool, silly. Oh, and before I forget, you have plans on your birthday. Me and Phil are gonna throw you a little gathering in the backyard. Gwen, I told you, no party. But you're turning the big 3-0, Jules. Come on. Yeah, I'm turning 30, I am single, I have no prospect for a husband, oh, and I'm broke. Not much to celebrate. All right, as far as being broke, you clearly need a second job, and as for being a spinster, we're just going to have to get you hooked up. No way. I am not falling for another one of your hook-ups... or your husband's, for that matter. You guys both stink at it. Hey, Ravi was a great blind date, okay? He's a catch. Whoa. What is that? The empathy belly pregnancy simulator, so Phil can relate to how I'm feeling. I can experience up to 20 symptoms of pregnancy right now. 30 pounds of weight gain, fetal kicking, shallow breathing, shortness of breath, increased blood pressure, back pain, irritability. Plus, it even presses up against my bladder, so I feel the full effect. Do you wanna try? No, I'm good. I'm gonna wait for the real thing. Which is gonna happen, because Phil and I have invited all of Phil's single friends to your party. Yay. You mean the ones that were still single at my last party? You know what? Don't worry about it. There's gonna be options. Yeah, well, there better be, because if this birthday fails to yield me a man, I'm seriously going to adopt. Oh, Julia, don't be so dramatic. Great party, right? Yeah. If I was turning 5 not 30. We told everyone it was a family friendly party, seeing as how everyone has kids now, right? Hey, did you get a chance to talk to Phil's friends from the club? Cheers, guys. You're welcome. Does Phil ever question why they're all still single? You know what? I'm going to go dry off. Okay. Dad! How's my ray of sunshine? What are you doing here? I was going to take the bus out to see you. How could I miss my little girl's 30th? Well you'll stay, right? For the night? Well, it's bridge night, and as condo organizer, I got to be there to make sure things don't get out of hand. This is for you. Dad, you didn't have to get my anything... it's from your mother. This is from her charm bracelet. Before she died, she wanted you to have it for your first-born, but I just figured you should have it now. Why? Because I'd be old and gray otherwise? It'll happen when it's meant to be. Just look at you... you took your sweet time coming after your sister. Look, Jules, I know that we were supposed to... the plan was to get pregnant together, but doesn't mean you have to go and do something crazy like adopt. I mean, my "motherhood ready" book says you need to be able to master all things before you become a mother. Like what? Like, I don't know, your plants. I mean, they're always dying, Jules. I run a baby bootcamp. I know what I'm doing. Baby toys. Okay, everybody, let's begin the class. We're going to start with some really easy neck rolls, just releasing all the tension from carrying baby. Excuse me. I'm assuming this is the baby bootcamp? Yeah, this is it, the one and only. Right. Your website says that this is for new parents, not just for moms only. No, it's for new parents, dads too. You're just our first dad. Okay, great. Lucky me. Let me get you a mat. I know him. He shops at the grocery store near my house. I heard he's a widower. - A widower? - That's what I heard. Pretty sad. So, are you sure this is okay? Because we don't mind either way. No, it's fine. You can just skip the kegel exercises. Great, thank you. Thank you. Hear that? We don't have to do kegels. Don't be shy. I mean, hi. I'm kind of the class leader, so if you want my opinion, you'll get a better workout with... who's that adorable little pumpkin? This is Mattie. - Say "hi," Mattie? - Hi, Mattie! So, just how Mattie is up on your chest, you want to like this... all right, everybody, social hour's over. So let's start with lunges. Left leg back first. Switching. Right foot back. Thanks. Here's your mat. Thank you very much. I'll bring my own next time. By the way, great workout. I feel like my legs are going to buckle thanks. Hope you don't have far to walk. No, my office is, like, literally just around the corner. So I should be able to make it. Barely, but I'll make it. - Anyway, same time next week? - Same time, same place. Okay, thank you. Okay, he is too cute. Gwen. Cute, and I'm sure, happily married. Actually, no. What, you have the scoop on him already? - What? Divorced? - Widowed. You're like a lawyer at a crash site. Cop. Morning, ladies. - Morning. - Morning. What y'all doing in the park so early? - Morning stretches. - Morning stretches. Stretches, okay. So you wouldn't be operating a fitness class, or anything like that, right? - No... - Good god, no. No, god, no. Because you need a permit and insurance to do that, huh? What? Really? That sounds complicated. Complicated... Sis! - I think it's time. - It's time. Are you okay? Are you sure? Yeah, we're great. Escort, full lights. I can call my friends... You need to get insurance. Keep walking. All right. "Delinquent..." "Delinquent." "Past due." Excuse me, not that you're not beautiful already, but it's like I always say, fit bodies pre-baby make fit mommies with babies. Thank you. Sure. We're always accepting new members. - Hey. - Hey! Look at you, shake-down advertising, I love it. Where are you guys going? Just going to the office. You want to walk with us? - Sure. - Great, come on. You bring Mattie to the office? Oh, yeah. I have a little play area set up for her, so it's not that bad. What do you do? I run an adventure tour company, actually. - Really? - Yeah. That's awesome. Well, I'm glad you think so. I'm not always so sure. So, you take people, like, shark diving, and mountain biking? That's so cool. I've always wanted to do that night safari, where the animals hunt each other. Look at you, all go-getter. Yeah, we do all that stuff. How did you get into that? Well, when my wife and I first met, we did a lot of traveling together. And this one time, we were in Brazil, and we were about to bungee jump off the Altavila tower and the idea just sort of popped into my head, hence the name "Alta adventures." You know, I'm sorry about your wife. I heard from the girls. Yeah, it's been hard, but... We're managing. I think. We're managing, right? Anyway, how about you? You do much traveling? No, not exactly. It's not in the budget right now. How about you? That's a stupid question. You run a travel company. No, no, not at all I mean, you'd think, right? Unless you're counting trips to the kids' park, no, we don't do much traveling at all right now. Anyway, this is me, so, thanks for the company. And I'll see you in class. You bet. - Okay, bye. - Bye. - Hey. - Hey! So, clean bill of health? Well, Mattie got a clean bill of health. The doc wants me to start eating a little healthier. Tofu. You can make that stuff taste like anything, ground beef, chicken. It tastes like nothing. Yeah, it is sort of nasty. So, you want the good news or the bad news? Bad? You missed the conference call. Jer', I'm so sorry. I totally forgot. No, it's cool, I covered for you. I said you were out with the flu, but the good news is... We got the account. Yes! Atta boy! Yeah, they want to talk to you man, about numbers, marketing, all that stuff. So I set the video call at 4:00. Oh, shoot. Mattie has rainbow songs at 4:00. You know what, no biggie, I'll take her. No, Jer', you already do too much. I'm not gonna subject you to a bunch of kid sing-alongs. Dude, are you kidding? Remember the old garage band days? Don't worry about it, man. I got this. Okay. Thank you, and I owe you. You don't. But I really think you should reconsider getting a nanny. Yeah... If I could just... you know, I don't want my kids raised by somebody I don't know. I get that, I do, but no one else is raising them. It's just an extra hand to help out. Think about it. Okay? - Yeah, I'll think about it. - And what is that smell? That smell, that smell is your turn. Oh, Mattie... Does someone have a little stinky bum? Okay. All right. All I'm saying, dude, is think about it. Nanny! Bye, sweetheart. I love you. Isn't it weird how every stage of development can be described as either a fruit or a vegetable? I mean, first she's a pear, then she's a grapefruit... you're supposed to be relaxing, not talking. I'm multi-tasking. I saw that. How? Every mother has eyes in the back of her head, my dear, even expectant ones. On to child's pose. All right, everybody. Up and into child's pose. Just wanted to say, another great class, but, as usual, we're in a rush to go, so, thanks... hey, so, do you... do you have any help? I mean, we heard about your wife. I'm sorry. My sister doesn't know anything. At all. No, that's okay. It's okay. The answer to your question is no, we haven't got any help since my wife passed away. But my business partner's just about got me convinced to hire a nanny, part-time around the house anyway. - Really? - Yeah. Well, you know, Julia actually used to be a nanny. - Really? - Yeah! Okay, Gwen, no... Don't be so shy. She is so great with kids. And extremely domestic. I mean, she cooks, she cleans, and she was actually just looking for another job. - I was? - Yeah. And you live pretty nearby, I presume? Yeah, literally, just, like, five minutes up the street, yeah. That is so great, because Julia actually lives just a few blocks away. Really? Well, okay, what kind of hours are you looking for? Because I don't technically have to be in the office until after 10:00, so that could really work around your class schedule. Yeah. Yeah, that... that's good. Okay, well, you know what? Here, I've got a card. Why don't you just email me, and come up with a time to swing by the house, and... we'll go from there. Perfect! All right, well, there you go. Okay, guys. Thanks. All right, you take care, Scott. Would you look at that? We got you a man and a job all in one. Gwen, I can't even take care of a plant and you signed me up to be a nanny! Don't worry, okay? I'll give you my books. I'll teach you. - Well, I do need the money. - See? Besides, it's just one kid. I mean, it'll be a breeze. - So, is she hot? - Sorry, what? Don't play that game with me. Is she good-looking? Well, she's a fitness instructor. Yeah, she's very pretty. A hot fitness instructor nanny! My man, this is beyond, like, every dude's wild dream. Right? Maybe yours. You know, you're like my bestest friend, right? So, clearly, I'm coming from a good place when I say this, but it is time for you to get back in the dating world. I don't know, I just don't know. I loved Claire, too. You know that. But she wouldn't have wanted you to be alone forever. Yeah, I realize that. You're right. But I don't think she had the nanny in mind. Okay, fair enough. Then at least agree to come with me to the riv' this weekend. We can get hot nanny to babysit. - If I hire her. - Of course. So are we on? Mattie, what do you think? Should I go? Talk some sense into daddy. That's a good point. Hi! - Hi. - Welcome. Mattie's in the kitchen, so come on in. Okay. If you could just, put Mattie's bib on, that would be great. Hi. Sure. Give me a chance to finish up Charlotte's grilled cheese. Yeah, no problem. I'm sorry. Who's Charlotte? Charlotte's my other daughter. Hey, Char. There you are, honey. Come on in here and meet Julia. I didn't know you had another daughter. Well, this one is my little angel. I don't know what I'd do without her. Mattie! Sorry about that. It's... I guess it doesn't all end up in the bib, huh? It's okay. You've got a... There's a... in your hair. Yeah. Jeez, I have to make a quick call, so you know what, I think Mattie is done. Come on, up we go. There you go. Maybe the two of you can just sort of get to know each other a little bit and I'll be back in a few minutes when I deal with this, okay? No problem. So, Charlotte. How old are you? Seven and three months. So that's... Grade two, right? How old are you? I am 30, and two weeks. But who's counting? What are you reading? "Penelope the sleuth." I loved that book. Have you ever read any of the Nina girl P.I. Books? Poo. Well, I liked them. No, Mattie, she's doing a poo. I'll show you where to change her. Okay. You should clean her first. And don't forget her back. - Poop goes all the way up. - Right. Could these be any smaller? I have poo on my hand. Okay... It's sticky. Thanks. I'm a little rusty. Sorry about that. Australia, time zones, it's crazy, but, you guys look like you're doing all right. Everybody's getting along? We sure are. That's great, I mean, I guess... If you're happy, then I'm happy to go ahead and make this official, I guess. Really? That's great. Excellent. I just... one more thing, if you're not busy, maybe on Saturday night, you could watch the girls for me for a little while? - Saturday night? - Only if you're not busy. And then we can start three days a week from Monday? Sounds... Terrible. I mean, I had no idea what I was doing. If it wasn't for Charlotte, I would have never gotten that diaper on. And that's another thing. Nobody told me he had two kids. It's kind of a game-changer, don't you think? Do you remember dodging the cop? You need money to make this bootcamp thing legit, Jules. That's the bottom line. What are you doing? Water birth, remember? How much harder can one more kid be? Twice as hard. I mean, I feel like I'm really in over my head here. Although Scott is pretty awesome. You should see how cute he is with the girls. So, maybe it's not just for the money? Now what are you doing? Getting you some help. For what? Baby bootcamp, Julia. Baby bootcamp. Feeding time. Organic is a must. Anything purple or green are the healthiest. Those are the ones you want. Pasta's a staple. Red sauce tastes great and keeps it fun. Chop and mash, chop and mash, chop and mash. Everything is a choking hazard at Mattie's age. Veggies with low sodium soy, coconut butter or pea butter on gluten-free toast, and remember, no nuts. When in doubt, cheese puffs, cheese crisps, anything cheese. Got it? Got it. Baby-proofing. All sharp corners, drawers, cupboards. Hey, honey? See? Baby-proofing. Okay, well, I just put Mattie down, and you don't have to worry about her because she never wakes up. And this one has to go to bed at... - 8:30. - 8:30? No. 8:00. Nice try, young lady. But she knows what else she has to do, teeth, jammies, and Mr. Brown. Who's Mr. Brown? Mr. Brown is her favorite stuffie. Her mom gave it to her. So, where are you going tonight? Tonight, a friend of mine, actually my business partner, Jeremy, is dragging me out, because... he seems to think that I need to get back in the game. Yeah. Hola! Anyone home? Uncle Jer'! Hi, Char! How's my number one girl? Give me some knuckles. Boom! Oh, la-la... You must be the new nanny I've heard about. Julia, this is Jeremy. Jeremy, Julia. Please, do not embarrass me. - Hi. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. You are... fit. Maybe I should sign up for that boot camp Scott's been doing. I could use a little tone up, huh? - What do you think? - Sure. Okay, on that incredibly inappropriate moment, I think we should get going. - You have my cell, right? - Yes, it's in the phone. Okay, and you, young lady, you... You be good, okay? - All right, we should go. - Yeah. You be bad. Really nice meeting you. All right, homework. Let's start here. It's okay... Here, this should help. Thank you. What about you, bedtime? Is this your first nanny job? Yeah, sort of. Are you a mom? No, not yet. How come? Well... I guess I haven't met the right daddy. There you go. Snug as a bug in the rug. Thanks for your help today. You're pretty smart for a seven-year- and-three-month-old. Thanks. You should have seen them, Gwen. They were all dressed up for a night of trolling. Just because he's going out doesn't mean he's picking up. Scratch Betty. She's new, not 90. He said he was getting back in the game. I mean, if that doesn't mean he's picking up, I'm not sure what does. What if he does meet someone tonight? So what, Julia? You're in. I mean, you're basically like a surrogate to his children now. There's no competition. - Maxine? - No Maxine. But why not? That was our first choice. What do you think the kids are going to call her? Maxi? Max? Max... Maxi-pad. - Yeah. - Gotcha. Okay. Anyway... Mr. Brown. I mean, he is kind of the perfect husband material, with the house and the kids. And you're right, as soon as he sees how great I am with Charlotte and Mattie, he's sure to fall in love with me, right? Tennessee? Like, Tenny? She's a 10! Look, I should go check on the girls. I'll keep you posted. Hello. Hey, sleepyhead, wake up. - Hey. - Hey. - Sorry. - That's okay. What time is it? Just a little after 10:00. That's it? Yeah, no, I just, I guess I just wasn't into the whole scene, really. Really? Yeah, I don't know, maybe I'm just too old, or jaded, or something, but it just kind of felt like a... - Like a meat market? - Yes. Exactly like a meat market. Anyway, so I came home. I was just going to get a drink. Do you want something? Water would be great. Water, okay. I can do that. So, how were the girls? The girls were great, no problems. - My kids? - Yeah. - Really? - Yup. Okay. Well, good, I guess. There you go. Look, I just, I wanted to ask you, did Charlotte talk to you at all about her mom by any chance? No, she didn't. I was just sort of thinking that, you know, with you being a girl and all, that she might open up to you a little bit. Not that we don't talk. I mean, we talk about everything, but, you know, she's just... Ever since her mom died, she's been... She's been quieter, you know? What happened? To her mom, your wife? If you don't want to talk about it, I completely understand. No, no, it's fine. I mean, I should probably tell you, anyway, in case she does want to talk about it, right? Shortly after we found out that Claire was pregnant with Mattie, she started having all these weird things happen to her body. Like, you know, bumps, and pains and stuff like that, but we just thought it was the pregnancy, so we didn't really... We didn't pay much attention. But then things got worse, she started to feel worse. The doctor said that wasn't normal. So we did some tests. Two months later, she was diagnosed with stage four cancer. I can't imagine. Yeah. And of course, she refused the chemo because of Mattie. She never would have made it. Seven months later, she gave birth to our beautiful, healthy baby girl... And an hour later, she died. But not before they met. They were both determined that that was gonna happen. And it was just for a moment, but... I know they say that newborns' eyes don't focus, but... I saw the way Mattie looked at Claire, and she knew... I mean, she knew that that was her mom. So they met. They met. I am so sorry. Yeah, me too. But anyway... Oh, boy. You know, we're managing. Anyway. Yeah, we're managing. But... Charlotte, she's... She's been my rock, because, honestly, I... I don't know if I would have made it through this without her. Yeah, and... Now you're here, too, right? So things can only get better. I want to help. I really want to help. Thank you. I should go. I have to get up early. Of course, yeah. Boot camp, right? - You know it. - Yeah. - Well, I'll see Monday. - Okay. Monday. Good night. Good night. I mean, it's so tragic, never to see your children grow up? Kind of like mom? I mean, she saw us grow up to be teenagers, but she's never going to get to meet her granddaughter. Here it is, 3D baby monitor. It comes with glasses that give you the added bonus value of entertainment while you watch your baby sleep! I totally need this! Right? - Thank you! - Yeah. How awesome is this? I mean, it's good that Charlotte's got you now. You know, and who knows, maybe you'll become more. I don't know, Gwen, it feels wrong going after someone with a wounded heart. Look, I get that he's been through some stuff, but everyone has a second chance at happiness. Who's to say you're not his? Just keep the door open to it, all right? Now, this is the latest from the mommy and Mozart collection. Many expectant mothers play this for their developing foetus. It's really for the avant garde parent. That's so totally me and Phil. Like, completely. There is a correlation between classical music-listening baby fetuses becoming excellent mathematicians. - They, like, did a study. - I'm sure they did. Are bears gender neutral? Charlotte would love this. It's perfect for her. See? You're already thinking like a mommy. Good morning. Hey, you brought supplies. That I did. Hey, sweetheart. Charlotte, I thought you might like this. I'm almost 8, you know. I don't play with stuffies. Hey... Don't be so rude, you little rat, she's just trying to be thoughtful. No, it's... it's fine. Of course. I mean, you already have Mr. Brown, and he's pretty special. He's not a stuffie. He's a rabbit. And, yes, he is special. Okay, on that note, I think we should probably get going. Mattie's still upstairs sleeping, she should be up in a few minutes. You've got my number at the office if you need anything, and this one's friend's mom is dropping her off after school, so... - Good? - I'm good. Have a... have a good day at work. Good luck. Bye, Charlotte. Hey... Yeah. Hi. Hey. Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle... Hi. Come on, Mattie. Yeah! Yes! Oh, you did it. You did it! Charlotte, did you see? Mattie was walking. Whatever. That was good. That was good. You want a snack? I have some leftover pasta. Actually, I don't feel like pasta. I want a grilled cheese. Of course. Coming right up. Voila. That's not the way my dad makes it. How about some scrambled eggs? You got it. I want waffles. Your waffles. I only like chicken noodle. Cheese puffs? Okay. Here, this is how you do it. Thanks. - These should be burned. - Actually, we like to wash them. These are disposable diapers. Disposable dirty diapers. We like to recycle. Really? And my dad will be really happy. Okay. Great. Done. Mattie's up. I'm going to go get her. Hey, you guys. How you doing? How was your day? Pretty good. Good. Hi. Oh, my. Did I miss a party or something? Yeah, I meant to get to those, as soon as I finished folding the diapers. Folding the diapers? Yeah, I washed and folded the diapers just like you like it. - That's great. - Reuse and recycle, right? Reuse and recycle the diapers, that's great. Yeah. Yeah, I baby-proofed the house. Baby-proofed the house. Great. Hey, I want to show you something. Want to show him? Yeah. Okay, Mattie. Good girl! - Amazing, right? - It's amazing. Isn't it time for Julia to go home? Charlotte, honey, did you see this? Your sister is walking. Yeah, I did. Well, I'd better get going. The dishes. No, no, that's okay. We'll do the dishes, that's all right. I'm so proud of you. Bye, Charlotte. Bye, Mattie. Bye. Bye-bye. See you later. You're walking. She's walking, isn't that great? Come here, you. Don't be so grumpy. Okay, ladies, and gentlemen, you're doing great. Keep it up. 30 more seconds. Perfect. Are you okay? Karla, why don't you start stretching? Yeah. You know what, Julia, if you work like this, if you alternate like this, you get a way better workout. Okay, Amber, thank you. Karla, what is it? The baby! It's coming! I thought you said your babies never came early. Take it up with him. Gwen, go get your car. No, no, no, no time. It's coming now! Amber, call 911. Tell them exactly what's going on. Gwen, get me some towels. We're going to have to put the baby on a towel. You, are you ready for this? Ready? You mean, me? Us? Here? Yes, we're going to have a baby at baby bootcamp. Now, I need you to go behind her, support her back and her neck. Okay... Are you cool with this? All right, now, I need you to push, okay? Thank you, got it. It's going to get a little creepy and weird. You ready? Okay, here we go, here we go. That's it. Good, good. One more. You're doing great. There you go, I can see him. I can see him. This is crazy. Oh, my goodness. Thank you. Hey! He's got blood on his hands. Call for back-up! I need your help, come on... he's got blood on his hands. Freeze! Whoa! What? Hey, hey, hey. I think there's been a little misunderstanding here, guys. What are you doing? Stand back. He may still be armed. Armed? With what, a baby soother? This man just delivered a baby. Yes! That's right, a baby! So maybe you could come and help us out? Oh, well... I like babies. Sure. Good, I'm good, enough with all the fuss. The entire park just saw all my lady parts, but, you know, I'm good. Amazing. You were incredible, how you just jumped in there. No, no, you were incredible. And you know what, you were incredible, too. You the organizer here of this little... Baby bootcamp? And... Do not try and deny it. Right. Permit and insurance, please. You know what, I don't have those things right now, but I am working on it. You just pay this ticket. And consider yourself lucky that your friend here, who gave birth under your watch, doesn't sue. As if I would. If it wasn't for this group, who knows what would have happened. Seeing as you all took your sweet time getting here. Okay. If I see you here, or anywhere in this park, without the proper documentation, I'm going to shut you down, for good. And that's a promise. Let's go! Well, that's it, my career is officially over. He shut down my boot camp. For now. Look at the bright side, Jules. You've got a new nanny job with extra hours, which definitely means that he likes you. Yeah, until he finds out I don't know what I'm doing. Who is this? This is Stephanie, my midwife. Stephanie, this is my sister. You know, Julia... food, it's the way to a man's heart. That's ridiculous. Honey! What are you talking about? Okay, our fourth date, you cooked me a beef tenderloin with bernaise sauce and garlic mashed potatoes. That was the first day I fell in love with you. Really? I love you. Same! You... Food. It's the way to a man's heart. So, Charlotte, your dad asked me to cook dinner tonight. Any idea on what he might like? Why? I thought it might be fun to have dinner as a family. Well, he definitely doesn't like meat. So he's like a vegetarian? Oh, yeah. Lots of vegetables. Cool. - I can make a mean tofu. - He loves tofu. Hey, Charlotte, love your hair. Can we just go? Hey, you okay? No one wears pigtails anymore. Charlotte? You hungry? I've got snacks? I'm not hungry. You know, when I was in school, there were mean girls, too. Girls that made you feel like you weren't good enough, pretty enough. Melissa Cuthburt. She's always picking on my clothes, my hair. She said I look like a baby because I still wear my hair in pigtails. What's wrong with pigtails? I love pigtails. Melissa gets her hair cut in a salon. Dad still cuts mine. And he doesn't get that my clothes are old, or that I don't want to wear pigtails anymore. You know... My mom died when I was 13. She did? Yeah, she did, right before high school. And trust me, you've never met a mean girl till you meet one in high school. And my dad, well, he didn't understand either. He didn't understand why I wanted to wear cool jeans or get my hair highlighted. Dad's aren't supposed to. But I understand. And if you want, maybe I could help you. Okay, so we have one hour till Mattie wakes up from her nap, so let's do this. So, what do you think? I love it. You know, I'm pretty good at putting outfits together, too, so if you want, maybe we could go shopping. Get some cool new tops. I saw these great pink converse with glitter all over them... I can't. Are you sure? We could make a girl's day out of it. You're not my mom, you know. And if you think my dad will ever replace her, you're wrong. Hey, what happened to doctor's orders? That does not smell like tofu. It's so good, though. And it has lettuce and tomatoes. So, question. Does she have a boyfriend? Does who have a boyfriend? The hot nanny. I don't know. I don't think so. Why? Well, I was just thinking that I might, like, ask her out. I mean, that is if you're cool with it. Only if you're okay with it. Well, yeah, I just... But what happened to the super hot stewardess that you were dating? I mean, she was... like. She was hot. Yeah, like, really. Yeah, but her time change clock, it was screwing me up. I was getting jet-lagged in my own city. Right. But look, if you're not cool with me asking Jemma out, I will just... Julia. Her name is Julia. Julia. Right. I meant-i meant Julia. I should get that right. But honestly, man, if you're not okay with it, I'll totally, like, step aside. No, no, no, it's... No, it's fine. It's not like I'm not dating her, so... And you don't want to? What? You don't want to date her. No. I mean, no, she's the kids' nanny, that's it. She's the nanny. Yeah. Okay. Sweet. I'll grab her number off that resume. And don't worry, buddy. I will give you all the dirty deets. Boo-ya! Julia. Julia... I'm home! - Hey. - Hey. What's all this? Dinner. Remember? You asked me to start it, so... Here it is. Okay. Where's Mattie? She's asleep. Okay. Well, this looks really good. Yeah. Did you eat before? No. No, no, just a... Here, I can. Okay. Thank you. Oh, Charlotte. Shall we? Hi, sweetheart. Hey, you have a braid. And pigtails. Sure. Yes, and pigtails. So, did you do fun stuff today? Not really. Just grocery shopping. Okay. All righty. It looks, it looks really good. It's tofu. Your favorite. Tofu. And sorry, who told you that tofu was my favorite? Charlotte. She mentioned you were a vegetarian. Did she now? Okay. Great. You know what, you don't have to eat it... no, no, no, it's... It's very good. I love it. Really? You try it. Tell me what you think. Go ahead, yeah. Yeah. It's really... It's really... Love it. It's, it's really good. You were supposed to hate it! Whoa, honey. Hey... Charlotte, honey. I'll just... I'll go talk to her. I'm sorry. Hello. Hi. You know, you look more and more like your mom every day. I don't know. I'm not so sure. Why would you say that? I'm starting to not remember what she looked like, and it's my fault, because I don't think about her every day like I used to. Oh, sweetheart. It's okay. Look... It just means... it means that you're healing. Okay? And you are never going to forget about your mom. You know why? Because she's right here. In your heart. And she always will be, okay? I just wish I could see her one more time. Oh, baby, I know, I know, I know. Oh, babe, it's okay. - Hey. - Hey. - There you go. - Thanks. Yeah. So, how is she? She's all right. She's... She's up there, she's got all the blinds closed, she's setting her little tea set. She'll be fine. She just misses her mom a lot right now, I think. Anyhow, what are your plans, now that the baby boot camp thing is on hold for a while? I don't know. You know, I always thought I'd be married and settled with kids by now. Really? Yeah. But... I don't know, just to me, you seem sort of, you know, carefree and independent. You know, the night safaris, the mountain hiking, all that. Yeah, I mean, I still want to do all those things, I just, I always envisioned a baby on my back while I was hiking, or kids in the Jeep on the safari. That's-that's funny, because, well, I used to have all those same visions. And then, you know, with everything that's happened, I just sort of lost sight of them. They could still come true. No, no, no. My sister's due, so I should get this. Of course. Hello? Jeremy? Right! Right. You know what, can I get back to you on that? All right, sounds good. So, that was... - Jeremy. - Jeremy. Yeah. Yeah. What did he want? He wanted to know if I would go to dinner with him sometime. Is that weird? I don't know... I don't know. I mean, is it weird for you? I don't know. I don't know either. It's just... You know what, I should probably go. Right. But I'll see you on Monday. Okay. Yeah. There's no way I'm going out with his friend. I mean, that's total sabotage. You said you kind of felt like you and Scott had a moment, right? I think so. I mean, it felt like we had a moment. Well, why not be sure and go out on a date with Jeremy? I don't follow. If you really want to know. Scott's feelings towards you, what better way than to make him jealous? You women are cruel. More Achilles. Are you sure? I mean, I don't want to turn him off. I am positive. Do it. Okay. Honey, hang this up? Thank you. Other one. You are lucky I love you. You love me so much. I think this one. - This one? - Yeah, definitely. Definitely that one. That one's creepy. Yeah, that's better. So, have you decided where you're going to take Julia? You know, for the big... The big date. Oh, yes, I have. I was thinking Rodney's oyster bar. You know, oysters are an aphrodisiac. Yeah. You're... you're still cool with this, right? Oh yeah. Yeah, of course. You know what, I just don't think she's your type. Really? My type? - Yeah. - How come? Well... Okay, first of all, she's boring. Like, no sense of adventure whatsoever. Really, I'm serious. And so not ready to settle down. I mean, you know, I look at her, and I just don't see mother material at all, so if you're thinking about something serious, then I just don't... I don't know if it's right... whoa, whoa, whoa, slow it down, my friend. Who said anything about serious? I'm just looking to have some fun, if you know what I mean. And you know what I mean. - This one's cool. - Yeah, it's great. That one's a winner. Yeah. Like, that's fun. I brought some of my Nina girl P.I. Books in case you wanted to read them. No thanks. Well, I'll just leave them here in case you change your mind. All right, stinker, let's get your diaper changed. Hey, sweetheart. Hi, daddy. Hi. She has a pretty voice, doesn't she? I guess. She does. Hey. You're home. Here you go. Hi, sweetheart. Okay, well, I just need to freshen up before I meet Jeremy, so do you mind if I use the washroom? Yeah. Yeah, of course. Yes. Well, I guess I'm going to get going. You look amazing. Thanks. Bye, Charlotte. Bye, Mattie. Good night. Bye. It's okay, sweetie. She's coming back. She's coming back... So, tell me, what does Julia the fitness instructor slash nanny like to do for fun? I don't know, boring stuff, I guess. Really? How about you? Well, personally, I love to feed beautiful women. No. No? They're delicious. Okay. So, how long have you and Scott been friends? It's got some kick to it. A long time, since we were, like, 16. So, you knew his wife. Yeah, I did. Claire was, she was one of a kind, you know, smart, sophisticated, classy, but also really laid back. She sounds amazing. I mean, it would be hard for Scott to find someone to live up to that... unless, of course he's found someone. Oh, no. No, no, no, Scott hasn't dated anybody since Claire died. I mean, I've tried to get him out there. He's just... He's not interested. That's too bad. I mean, he's a great guy. And dad. I mean, he'd be a great catch for... For someone. Right. For someone... like, say someone who's great with his kids. Of course. I mean, they'd have to be. And fit. I mean, Scott is a real do-er. Very fit. So they could keep up. Yeah, like you. Exactly. No! Not me. Not me-me. I mean, like me. - Like you. - Right... - Right. - Right. Okay, I'm going to call. No, I'm not going to call. And you should see how cute he is with Mattie. I mean, how many guys do you know that would go to a baby boot camp? - Not many. - And all the girls love him. I mean, he's just... Charming, and... He is. Sensitive, but still masculine. Yeah, no, and he's handsome. The man's got great calves. I mean... Okay, I'm going to call, I'm going to call. I'm going to call... Speak of the devil. Scott, what's shaking, buddy? Hey, Jer', how you doing? Look, sorry to bother you on your date, and all. Are you still on the... on the date? Kind of, I guess. Great, well, that's good... Yeah, no, I just wanted to know if the... Scuba place from Belize got back to you about the thing. They did, buddy. You were there, remember? It was a conference call? We were both on the call? Yeah, yeah, no, yeah, I remember. I remember, yeah. So. So that's great. Okay, yeah. Anything else that I can... Help you with, or... don't worry, bro, I'm hearing you. And you know what, you were right, Julia is totally not my type. Really? Nope, not in the slightest. Thanks, Jer'. Thank you. Okay, tell you what, how about... How about I get you home? Sounds good. If he called during the date, he was fishing for sure. Plus, he pretended to like her tofu casserole. And they had a moment. So I need to plan a day. Not just any day... you need to plan something that's special to you and him. I remember that day. It was the day me and Phil went rollerblading in Wyndham park and then we stopped for funnel cakes. Stew took me fishing, taught me how to fillet a fish fresh off the hook. I think I know exactly what to do. If you'd told me you had a thing for her, I never would have asked her out. I didn't know I had a thing for her. I still don't know that I have a thing. I just... I think she's great. And hot. Like, she's, like, really hot. Yeah, she's pretty. She's very pretty. She is pretty. And... I don't know, I just, it feels like a high school crush. Well, don't worry, all right, because if she could say no to this action, then obviously she's crushing on you, too. Really? You think so? Buddy, she talked about you the whole time. Okay, all right. Cool. So, what do I do? You ask her out. I don't know. What if she says no? Look, as your wingman, have I ever steered you wrong? I mean, okay, aside from that one time in Mexico... I apologize for that... but otherwise, have I ever steered you wrong? No. Okay. All right, I'm going to do it. I'll ask her out. That's my man. Morning! I'm here! Oh, boy. Hey, look at him. Look at him. Okay... Hey, Charlotte. You look nice today. Thanks. Hey. Hey... Look, why don't you go wait in the car and I'll be right there, okay? Atta girl. - Look, I just wanted to... - So I wanted to ask you... You... - No, you go. - No, you go. Absolutely you go first. Okay, I wanted to know if you'd maybe consider taking the afternoon off tomorrow, to go on an outing with me and the girls? I just thought it'd be nice, because, you know, you work so hard, and you never get a chance to spend a full day with them. Yeah. Yeah, that would... I would love that. It'd be great. Great. Let's say 11:00 at Granville island? Okay, yeah, sure. Granville island, 11:00. I'll be there. Hey, come here. Hey, guys. There you are. Hey. So, what's the plan? Welcome to the adventure tour of your city. Charlotte, our official photographer. Okay. Right this way. This is going to be so much fun. Okay, here we are. Last stop on the tour. I think they're sleeping, or at least one of them's sleeping. Anyway, thank you. You don't have to keep thanking me. Yes, I do, because for me, that day was... Well, for me, it was perfect. It was perfect for me, too. Cool. I was wondering if maybe you would like to have dinner with me sometime, and not at my place, and maybe not with them. Like at a restaurant or something? I would love that. Okay. Great. Well, I don't know, maybe Saturday night? I'll, I'll see if Jeremy will watch the girls and we can go out. It's a date. Okay, it's a date. Say goodbye to the girls for me. I will. Bye. Yes! Okay, he's asleep! Okay. So? What are you going to wear? I don't know. I haven't thought about it yet. Well, you definitely don't want to look like you're trying to hard. Anything without baby spit will be a step up. Definitely a dress, or maybe a jumpsuit? A jumpsuit? No, I'm thinking, like, a low-cut dress, she's gotta show a little... ladies, ladies! If you're talking, you're not working hard enough. Let's get back into it. Come on, I think there's still a spot. We really need to get back in the park. Your phone's ringing. You know what, this is work. Can you watch Mattie? I'll be right back. Sure. Baby bootcamp by Julia. Right, yeah, I know... Come on, let's play a little trick on Julia. I am looking for a bigger space. Dad definitely won't like this one. Okay. No, I'll get back to you. It's okay, Mattie. Charlotte. Charlotte, where's Mattie? Mattie! Where's Mattie? You lost Mattie? You were watching her. Where's Mattie? Mattie! Hey, guys. Mattie! I got some shots made up of the adventure day. - Dad! - What? Julia lost Mattie. What? Scott, she was just here. Mattie! Mattie. The shed, dad, check the shed. Mattie! Mattie? She's not here! She's not here. She was supposed to be in here! Mattie! Mattie. Mattie! Mattie! I found her! I found her... Mattie, oh, boy, oh, boy. I am so sorry. I'm so sorry. I should have never left her. Jules, I think you're being too hard on yourself. Am I? That's twice I've lost a baby. You should have seen the look on his face. I'm never going to be able to face him again. Besides, I have the money I need to get the camp up to speed. It was always for the money, right? What? What is it? What's happening? Okay, here we go. Arm, I need an arm. Is it happening? The baby? It's happening? Phil! Phil! Baby? Babe? What's wrong? What's wrong? It's happening! What? It? This? You? You're... camera! I'm going to get the camera! Hold on, baby, daddy's coming! I'm getting the camera. Baby, hold on. Hold on, okay. I'm coming. 'Kay, 'kay, 'kay. Hold on. Phil? I need you to remember the steps. You need to get the phone and call Stephanie. Oh, you're right! I'll call Stephanie! Gotta call the midwife. I'm coming, baby, don't you worry. Hold on, baby! Hold on, baby, here's the phone! Oh no! What was that? Oh, baby, that was nothing. Don't worry. Julia, do you have a cell phone I could borrow? - Yeah, it's in my car. - No, no, no! There's no time. She's coming. - What do you mean she's coming? - She's coming? Like now? Like, she's coming now! I'm really not feeling so good. I'm not feeling so... Good. He's okay. He's fine. I need to get my phone and call an ambulance. No, no, no, no. It's too late. Get in. She's coming. No, no, no. No, no, she can't! I need calm energy, Julia. Calm energy. Okay? Let's go. Okay. There's the head. Okay, it's time. Let's go. You're going to have to get in there. Yeah, yeah. You're going in there. You need to get under. Down there? You're going to have to catch her. I see the head, I see the head! Okay, get back down there. One more. I love you. I got her. I got her! Watch the cord. Gwen, you did it, you really did it. We did it. It's a boy. It's a boy? It's amazing, huh? Even after all that planning, he still managed to surprise us. Yeah, the doc says his old ding-a-ling was tucked right there between his legs on the sonogram. So, what are you going to name him? I don't know. I guess I'll have to get Phil to do up a whole new flowchart. Look at him. My little baby boy. I've got a son! He's beautiful. I've got a son... Stephanie, we had a son. You were amazing. Thank you. Well, at least I finally did something right. Julia... No, you were right. I need to learn how to master things before I become a mother... or a nanny. But at least now I have a little nephew to practice on. All right, you two, get some rest. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay. Bye. This is nice. Just the three of us, right? Yeah. Yeah, it's nice. Very nice. Dad? Do you miss mom? Yeah. Yeah, I do. I miss your mother very much. Then why did you ask Julia out on a date? Just because I like Julia, it doesn't mean that I've stopped loving your mom. I will always love your mother. But... She wanted us to be happy. And... I guess Julia makes me happy. So it's okay? Yeah. Yeah, it's okay. It's what she would have wanted. And no one is ever going to replace your mother, I promise you. And you two girls will always be my number one girls, okay? You got it? Are we good? Give me a hug. "Dear, Scott, Charlotte and Mattie, "where to begin? "I guess by saying "I should have been truthful with you from the beginning and told you I was completely in over my head..." The mail here. "...but I guess I'm just thankful "nothing truly bad happened to Mattie. This time." What is it, dad? It's a letter from Julia. It says she can't work for us anymore. Charlotte, honey. "My mom once told me "to always follow my heart, "but to make sure that logic was mixed in. "Which is why I can no longer work for you, Scott, even though I've fallen in love with your family." "My mom also told me "that honesty is always the best policy. "I'm not a nanny, Scott, "I'm a fitness instructor "if I can even get that together, but I'm not a nanny." "Do me a favor, will you? "Please give Charlotte a hug for me, "and tell her I love her, and I'm so sorry I let her down." Hey, man, why don't you just give her a call? Because she asked me to respect her decision, and I'm going to, it's the least I can do. Dude, are you crazy? A girl like that? You can't give up that easily. Jer', I appreciate it, okay? I really do. But I guess it's just not meant to be, all right? Fine. Mattie. Come here, sweetheart, let's go for a little walk. All right? All right, ladies, let's hold this for five more seconds. Five... Four... Three... Can we stop holding now? Yeah, sorry. Right, let me stop you. I have my insurance. Good job on turning this around. Thanks. All right, guys, finish up with some stretches. It's going to be okay, Jules. You're okay. It's okay, dad. I don't mind if it's burnt. I think you should call him. Gwen, don't you think it's time to admit our master plan failed? Did it? Julia, the number one thing couples fight over are their children. But that's just it, we didn't fight. I would have felt better if he yelled at me... better than the disappointment in his eyes. I'm just saying. You never even gave it a chance. It's kind of nice having dad here, right? Yeah. You should see how he lights up when he holds Austin. Speaking of which, I think he's hungry. Phil's got this one. Phil! Feeding time! You can't be serious. Why shouldn't he share in the bonding? I pump, I dump, pop it right in there, super easy. Third quarter's about to start. Right... I'll catch you in the fourth. That's uncle Jer'. He's taking me to school today. He is? Yup. See ya, dad. Whoa, whoa, whoa, give me a kiss. Bye, Mattie! I'll see you later. Did you get it? Yup, I got her address right here. - You got the brochure? - Got it. All right, kiddo, hop in. Let's do this. In the back you go. Seatbelts on. Your grandpa taught me that. Come on, we're going for a walk through Stanley park. Sweetheart, I'm just not in the mood right now. Dad, you can't just sit around here moping. Mom wouldn't have wanted that. Hey. Now, are you coming or not? Okay, fine, fine. Do you want to go for a walk? Yeah? Okay, let's do it. Where is she? Where's who? Julia! Julia? Why would Julia be here? Because I let her know we'd be here, so I could fix things, but I guess I messed things up real bad. Sweetheart, it's not your fault. It is. I'm the one who hid Mattie. I put her in the shed so you thought Julia lost her. Well, why would you do that? Because I was afraid, because you liked her, Mattie liked her, I liked her. And I thought if we liked her too much, she would replace mom, but now she's gone, and I miss her. I missed you, too. Julia, you came! Of course I did. I wouldn't want to miss out on my life adventure. Look, Julia, all that stuff with Mattie, I... It was me. I did it. I'm sorry. It's okay. I understand. So, does this mean that you would consider coming back? If you'll have me. I would like that very much. So this is a date, isn't it? Yeah... Maybe it is. I don't know, what do you think? What? Kiss her. You think? - I love you. - I love you, too. When Mattie gets bigger, she can come here, and I'll tell her all about mom. It's a beautiful tree, in memory of a beautiful mom. There are my other girls. Hello. Hi. He's kicking. Feel. Hello in there. Can you hear me? He can hear you, but it's like hearing underwater, at least that's what your aunt Gwen says. Aunt Gwen knows a lot. Aunt Gwen thinks she knows a lot... Yeah. Come on, let's go. RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
