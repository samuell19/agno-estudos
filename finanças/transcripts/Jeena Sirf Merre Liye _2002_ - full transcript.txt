Hello, Pinky dear. - Hi. Hello, sir. Karan.. - Pinky? Wait till I show you. "These days, months and years.." "shall pass by, my friend." "But do always remember.." "You will live only for me." "You will live only for me." "You will live only for me." "These days, months and years.." "shall pass by, my friend." "But do always remember.." "You will live only for me." "You will live only for me." "Promise me. You'll live only for me." "You will live only for me." Pinky? "Our friendship, I love more than this world." "To our friendship, I dedicate my life." "Don't ever forget the promises we make in love." "Whenever you miss me, do come over to meet me." "In love, the world" "poses a million question." "But do remember always.." "You will live only for me." "You will live only for me." "Promise me. You'll live only for me." "You will live only for me." - Pinky, wait! A pavement dweller wants to equal my daughter? He is not worthy to play with my daughter. Because of him, my daughter has taken ill. She's burning with fever. If I see him with my daughter ever again then I'm going to shoot him. I will shoot him! Because of him, my daughter has taken ill. She's burning with fever. Lord, I've brought my Pinky to you. Please make her all right. If you don't restore my Pinky's health, I'll never ever talk to you. Make Pinky all right, God. Make her all right, God! Pinky! Pinky! Pinky! Karan. Pinky! Who brought me here? - I.. I've brought you, here. You went delirious with fever. Look, God has made you all right. Look, we're returning today. Pack Pinky's clothes. Karan.. - Pinky? We're returning to Mumbai, today itself. Whenever you go away, I miss you so much. So keep this. Whenever you miss me, look at this watch. It even has my photograph. Wow, it even plays music. It's a lovely watch. I'll always keep it close to me. But what will I do, when I'll miss you? Just a minute. Here you are. Whenever you miss me pray to God so that we can meet up. Come, let's go. Enough is enough! Get in the car! Pinky? Pinky! Stop the car! Pinky, wait! Pinky! Pinky! Pinky! Lord, Pinky hasn't come this year, either. How do I go to Bombay to look for her? I have no one there. Show me the way, Lord. Mr Malhotra? Praise the Lord. Hello, sir. - Hello. You're visiting after so long? - Yes, I come here only for work. I was delivering some harmoniums at the Saraswati Music School and I thought I'd pay my obeisance. Who's that boy? - He's an orphan. Priest! Don't you dare call any child an orphan! We're the ones who give them this dreadful name. I admit, there are millions of children who do not have parents but there are also millions of parents who have no off springs. Had such parents adopt children like him the word 'Orphan' wouldn't exist in the world anymore. What's your name, dear? - Karan. No, dear. Your name isn't Karan. It's Karan Malhotra, henceforth. "It seeks love.." "Love is what it seeks." "It seeks love.." "Love is what it seeks." "It seeks love.." "Love is what it seeks." "It seeks love.." "Love is what it seeks." "It's a crazy world." "It hasn't yet realised." "It's a crazy world." "It hasn't yet realised." "How one loses his heart?" "Love, it seeks..." "Love is what it seeks." "It seeks love.." "Love is what it seeks." "I'm not going to befriend anyone." "I'm not falling in love with anyone." "Only once in a lifetime, do I make someone my heart-throb." "I haven't seen her yet. I don't even know her." "The thought of her gives solace to my heart." "It seeks love.." "Love is what it seeks." "It seeks love.." "Love is what it seeks." "Love isn't easy, my friend." "It's difficult to live up to it." "In this restlessness of desires, I spend every morning and evening." "A crazed heart, nobody can ever rein in." "Every crazy lover knows it. It's known by all." "It seeks love.." "Love is what it seeks." "It seeks love.." "Love is what it seeks." "It's a crazy world." "It hasn't yet realised." "How one loses his heart?" "It seeks love.." "Love is what it seeks." "It seeks love.." "Love is what it seeks." Let brother return. I won't spare him, today. Yes, dear. Just don't spare him today. You shouldn't be talking, Dad. You've spoilt him. Not me, it's your mother who has spoilt me. Yes. - Dad! All right, take him to task when he returns today. Sure, I will. But, please the two of you mustn't interfere. He's here! He's here! - Priya.. Priya's dead. Don't you dare say such a thing again. Why mustn't I? Today is the festival of 'Rakhi'. And I'm sure, you've forgotten it. I got held up buying a gift for you. - Excuse me, I want to see what gift is it, for which you took so long. Brother, this is.. - You wanted it six months ago, isn't it? Yes, but I forgot all about it. But how could your brother forget what you wanted? But this is very expensive. Where did you get so much money from? Why? Doesn't dad give me pocket money? I've been saving it for six months, now. Are you going to keep staring at it or tie the Rakhi on me? Oh, yes, just a minute. Hold it like this, place your fingers, over here. Try it. It's pretty nice. - Hello? Do you want to buy it? Yes, of course. - But, it's expensive. Yes, but it's good. - This one is cheap. Is she your wife? - Yes. What are you doing? You have to hold it like this. From below. - Okay. You can use it for your husband. - You're getting a phone call. Your phone! Just a second, I'll be back. - Okay. Go and take the call. - I think he's mad! Hello? Yes, Sapna? What is it? Go and attend to the customers. You're having a bout of hiccups, now? Sapna, did you get the money? What are you afraid of? I'm here, aren't I? Yes, I'm coming over on Monday. Hundred and one percent. It's late, son. Close the shop and come soon, okay? Okay. - We're leaving. Come soon. - Yes, sir. Open the door. - Here, sir. - Dad, I'll be having the dinner with you. Hey, my watch! - Lay off! Look, take as much money as you want. But please return my watch. Lots of dough, eh? - You think that's not enough, right? Here you are. Take this chain, too. But return that watch, please. Looks like an expensive watch. Let's check it out. So this is how it is? Whose photo is this? She's my childhood love. - Childhood love, is it? She must be quite tantalising by now. What are you doing? Get him out of here! No.. We'll give it to you. Here is your watch. Take it. Pinky, no one can snatch you and your love from me. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. After Sharon from Michigan University we now proudly present the Oxford University girl, Ms. Pooja.

It feels as if we aren't in a foreign land, but in India. There are so many Indians living here but it's only Puja who brings them all together and celebrates every festival. She doesn't ever forget her culture. Tell me something, ma'am. When the English visit our country do they forget their culture? - No. So, why must we forget our culture in their country? Well said, dear. I'm so proud of you. Happy Diwali, Pinky. Karan.. Come, let's go! I rue the cursed hour when she gave you that god damned watch! Ever since, you've always been clutching this watch to your heart. You've never fallen in love. So how would you know? I don't fall into a relationship that has no trace of love. My friend, God save me from the love that you exhibit. You love her with all your heart. In fact, you even visit that temple every year, so you can meet her. But did she ever meet you? I'll surely meet her. I have complete faith. I will surely find Pinky, one day. "May someone love me for a moment" "be it a falsity." Sapna, you're the one I was thinking about and you've called! No, not lunch. I've promised to have lunch with my wife. We can make it on next Monday because I don't work on Mondays.. Hello? - Hello. How do I look? You are turning more and more romantic with every passing day. Old age? Don't tell me! With a wife like you, no man can ever grow old. Old age will come and wither away and I'll remain forever young. But where are you going all dressed up on a holiday? It's a holiday, let me go and meet some friends. I'm definitely having lunch with you. Here you are. "I'm young at heart.." Oh, Lord! "I'm young at heart.." Karan.. What is the matter, Mom? - Your dad is showing symptoms of a teenager. He wants to be part of the brat pack. What does that mean? - I just can't understand what he's up to. He has started spending so much of money, of late. I wonder where he's spending the money. I think something is fishy. I feel so scared. Gayatri.. Dear, are you back? - Yes. Who is she? She is Sapna. - Sapna? My dream. Which I have fulfilled today. God! Dressed in a 'Sherwani', I got married in court today. Come, Sapna. - Okay. She's going to stay here and you will serve her all your life as her slave. - No! I will not tolerate another woman in my husband's life! I'll douse kerosene on myself and set myself on fire! You'll set fire to yourself and I'll take off this garland and put it on your photograph. Your nuptial chain I'll wear around my neck. Father! What have you done? Dad! You, just wait. I'm going to set myself on fire! - Mom? Are you blind? Can't you see? - You're the one, who is blind. It's your fault. Don't talk rot! - Hey, mister! He is not at fault but you. You're in a no entry zone. No entry? - Yes. This is a one-way street. - Look, I'm in a hurry. I'm sorry. - Shut up! Does being in a hurry, justifies your mistake? Give me your licence. Why do you want my licence? - I'll report you. I haven't caused an accident, have I? So, shall I'll report you after the accident? Out with your licence! The auto rickshaw! My purse was inside it. Oh, no! What shall I do now? My month's stipend was in my purse. How am I to make it to my interview? - I'll give you a lift. Yes, you'll have to. Sit, here. I'll be back. Pass the bike keys to me. What for? - For itching my ears. To make sure that you don't make a getaway. - What a fix I'm in! You mean you didn't find a single girl, is it? You didn't find a single eligible candidate. Is it? Shut up! In the entire country.. Girl? - Sorry to walk in without permission, sir. But this concerns my career, sir. I would've been here on time were it not for this boy who biked into a no entry zone and he had to crash into my auto, he even justified himself. So obviously, there was a tiff. Naturally, that was a waste of time. Consequently, I was delayed. I know, I've missed my interview. But if you wish you can still interview me, sir. You are already selected. Without an interview? - Your have given it, just now. A lovely, dynamic anchor like you is just what I need. What a girl! Thank you, sir. - Let go of me. He's so lucky for me. I've got the job without even appearing for the interview. He's lucky and handsome, too. Mustn't give up on him, so easily. Now, what do I do? Got to find an excuse! What happened? Did you get the job? - No, I got late. What an ominous day! Everything's turning out the wrong way. Will you let me go, now? I haven't informed folks at home about this. Besides, I got to reach my shop! - Shop? What kind of shop? I deal in music instruments. Hey, wait! Hello? Music instruments? - Yes. Shall I leave, now? Give my keys back to me. - I lost a month's stipend. And the month isn't ending in another five days. These five days you will give me rides on your bike. And what about my shop? And what about me? Am I to beg on the streets? Look I'm in no mood for a conversation. I'm hungry. First, stand me lunch. Don't irritate me, now. Now, I'm stuffed. - How about sparing me, now? Did you say something? - How much money have you lost? About Rs. 1200 or Rs. 1300. - I'll pay you Rs. 1500 to get rid of you. I'm not a beggar. In these five days if I land a job I'll pay you three grands. Else I'll pay you form my next month's stipend. Come on, cheer up, now! Won't you help a damsel in distress? That's more like it! Hey, do you have a girlfriend? She's the one I'm looking for. "I wish we always remain close to each other." "I wish our bond is never severed." "Be it happiness, or in sorrow." "Or, whatever may come forth." "But do remember, one thing." "You will live only for me." "You will live only for me." "It's a promise. You'll live only for me." "You will live only for me." "These days, months and years.." "shall pass by, my friend." "But do remember, one thing." "You will live only for me." "You will live only for me." "It's a promise. You'll live only for me." "You will live only for me." "It's a promise. You'll live only for me." "You will live only for me." Give it back to me. Give it back to me. After a lifetime of living abroad, your mentality is still the same. Ever since you were a child, you've been infatuated with someone you don't even know. And there is no hope to meet him. I'm not hopeful but certain of it. Someday, I'll surely find him. Hi! You? Why have you come here? Strange! Do you treat your customers so rudely? - Mad.. He's mad! Have you gone mad? The customer is like god. Is this how you address such an exotic a goddess? Who is as good looking as Shri Devi! Forget him, come to me. I worship goddesses. How may I be of service? My guitar needs to be repaired. Wonderful! Passing it to me while you make a pass at him? If you play it so mercilessly, the string is ought to break. I'm learning to play it. You ought to learn from a good artiste! Will you teach me? - I don't have time. You can pick it up, next week. - I want it, right now. Can't be cobbled up like a shoe. I'm here to take you with me, not the guitar! Me? - Didn't I tell you, I haven't got any money. I need a lift, right now to Worli. Enough. Day before yesterday you wasted my whole day, took me all over town. I'm fed up of you! - Not something I fancy! I'm helpless! Now give me a lift. Quick, I'm getting late. So, you want a lift again? Yes! Because you've run out of money? Yes! All right. Vicky? - Yes.. Get back after you've taken her for a ride. Yes. - No. - Yes. - Yes. If it's the lift you're interested in, he'll take you for the ride. Yes. Excuse me. I'll even give you a ride back home! Let's go! Move it, you're getting late. "Come, sit on my bike." Straddle the bike. Because I fly it like an aircraft. Come and sit. Who I? - You needn't ask, just sit. Grab my waist tightly. Move closer. If she took the rickshaw then who's on my pillion? Stop whining and take me for my ride. This is Mumbai's Band Stand. Also called as Lover's Paradise. We're talking to folks over here about love. 'This program is sponsored by Pooja Tea, drink and feel alive.' How many times have I told you not to watch TV while working? My customer is on TV. 'Hello. - Hi.' The goddess with the guitar! Have you ever been in love? - Yes, Rohit, Rahul, Nitin, Rocky. With so many? - No, they are merely half a dozen. This means, she got the job! Such a liar. I'll fix her, right away. Have you ever been in love? - Yes. But one lie and it all got ended. What kind of lie? - Sorry, I can't tell it. It's all right. Lies are ruinous, so be careful. Likewise in your case. Karan, listen to me. - Not a word more. You lied to me about your job. - You forced me to lie, Karan. What? I? - Yes, you. Your chivalry, a nice character and an innocent face made me feel like going out with you, making friends with you. If I'd have told you the truth, you'd have walked away! And I did not want that to happen. So, I lied to you. Okay, tell me. If you'd have been at my place then what would you have done? Tell me. Why are you mum? I can't win an argument with you. - So, are we friends? Out of compulsion. You aren't giving up on me so easily, are you? Shall I tell you the truth? I never want to lose a good friend. Puja, we're going to miss you. - I'll miss you, too. Inform us as soon as you're in India. - Sure. Puja, I always made digs at you about your childhood sweetheart. One for the road? No, I only want to share a thought with you. What? - I wish you find your sweetheart. Really? - Yes. But you got to make a promise. - What? When you find him, make sure I know of it before you tell him. Done. - Don't forget, all right? How about getting to the airport? - It's time for your flight. Dad? Dad! Hey! - Dad! Puja! How are you? Why didn't you receive me at the airport? I'm sorry, Puja. I got stuck in some meetings. That reminds me that I have to meet Mr. Khurana tomorrow at 10:30. Don't forget it. - Yes, sir. How was your journey? The joy of returning to India made me forget everything. You take some rest. I'm going to my office. We'll do dinner together. Bye. - Okay, bye. I'm sorry Karan, I couldn't meet you once an year. I'll make up for it from tomorrow. Wait for me, I'm coming, tomorrow. My obeisance. - Bless you, Karan A while ago, a girl was here asking about you. Pinky! Where is she? - She sat here for a while then she took a tour of the place before she left. When did she leave? - A while ago. "What if" "we had met?" "What would it be like?" "What if" "we had met?" "What would it be like?" "I'd never leave you in peace." "What would it be like?" "Nor would I sleep in peace." "What if" "we had met?" "What would it be like?" "I would've inflamed your passions." "I would've inflamed your passions." "And I would've lost the peace of my mind." "What if" "we had met?" "What would it be like?" "How I have spent my days, how my nights were spent" "I wanted to tell you how lovelorn I was." "How I have spent my days, how my nights were spent" "I wanted to tell you how lovelorn I was." "I would've taken you in my arms and I would've kissed you." "I wanted to show you the wounds in my heart." "I wanted to show you the wounds in my heart." "What if" "we had met?" "What would it be like?" "Were I not in love with you" "would I pine for you in solitude?" "Were I not in love with you" "would I pine for you in solitude?" "God, please let him know" "how I pine for him." "how I pine for him." "What if" "we had met?" "What would it be like?" "What if" "we had met?" "What would it be like?" "I would've inflamed your passions." "I would've inflamed your passions." "And I would've lost the peace of my mind." "What if" "we had met?" "What would it be like?" "What if" "we had met?" "What would it be like?" 'Hello, Puja!' You've found your Karan, isn't it? I'm so happy for you, Puja! 'Tell me, when you saw him' for the first time, were you bowled over? 'You held back, because you swore on me, isn't it?' Nothing of that sort happened. What do you mean? - I've looked for him but I couldn't find him. Then how will you look for him? I'm taking my story to the magazines. When he reads it, he'll find me. Have you lost your mind? Not even ten percent people read magazines, these days. I'm not giving up on my ten percent chance, either. You mean your plot is different, is it? Yes, sir. There were two others who claimed that before they gave me a reading. Unlike ordinary stories it's the story of my life. The story of my true love. - You mean to say that.. What is it? - Tape for episode one. Yours is the only true love? Others' love is fallacious, is it? Can't say about others. Speaking for myself my love is true. - Where are you from? I've just returned to India. I was brought up abroad. It means this love story hails from a foreign land, isn't it? No, the story pertains to India. The story pertains to India and you were abroad since childhood, is it? While you were abroad, didn't you take a psychiatric help? Do you mean I'm crazy? Yes and you're about to drive me crazy, as well. Don't drive me nuts. It increases my blood pressure. Then I'll have to call the doctor and I can't tolerate paying him. For my sake, I must get my story published. Excuse me, I got work to do. What is the matter? Why are you crying? Just because he is the editor does it give him the right, to call my story a trash? He called me insane! He's the one who has lost his mind. Let him not publish it but he has no right to call it a trash. What does he know? My story is all I got. It's about my love. It's my life. You can trust me with your life. Don't be afraid, I won't steal it. Let's go! Good morning, sir. - Good morning.. You aren't shooting, yet? - Not yet, sir. Sir, you need a romantic story for your magazine, isn't it? Yes, the same story is holding up my print run! Here's a story which I wrote. What? Have you written it? Yes. Publish it, if you like it. I'll have to go through it. Let me see, it's an emergency. Congratulations, Puja! The editor loved your story. Thank you, Seema. You don't know, you've laden me with such a big favour. There aren't any favours in friendship. Come on, the editor wants to see you. I'm really sorry, dear. It's an amazing story. But without the climax, it's incomplete. The climax is yet to come. But that makes an incomplete story, isn't it? Your magazine stands to gain from this story. How come? Sir, I'm sure, the readers will love it. And they will await the climax. In the next edition, when the climax will be revealed your issue will be a sell-out. Really? - Yes. - Sir, it's not a bad idea. Is it? There is no point in delaying it. I'll publish it, right away. Readers' letters are pouring in, Karan. But I haven't heard from you, yet. When will you read our story? Excuse me? - Yes, sir. Do you stock the P9 magazine? - Yes. I wanted it for myself, brother. - I only wanted to find out what's so special about this story that you wanted to read it so badly. You can take your time over it after I've read it. All right. Brother.. Where have you been? I've been waiting for you for hours. And no one wants to hear my story! You got to hear this. Come.. Sit down. Don't you budge until you've heard my story. The story is titled 'You will live only for me.' That's the promise Karan and Pinky made to each other when they were kids. What a coincidence! Your name is Karan, too. The story begins in a beautiful hill station. Every year Pinky and her father, go there to spend their holidays. And that is where she meets Karan. And a strong friendship is forged between them. Then slowly the friendship turns into love. Once Pinky has left Karan is left with only one thing to do. To wait for Pinky! The climax will be published after the couple have met. Please pray to God that in the end, they meet. Isn't it a nice story? It's a great story, brother. Thanks to the walk-man, my life just got saved. It's Channel Singh's 16th wedding anniversary. Live it up! Congratulations. - Thank you. Do you remember Jack? - It's so difficult to work with him. What are you saying? - He doesn't listen to anyone. Just a moment. - Happy Anniversary. Thank you. You're looking lovely May I say a couplet? Yes, please. "What if the one I pine for" "were to transpire before my eyes?" - Amazing, well done. I've been looking for you since so long. I want to introduce you to my boyfriend. Greetings. - Greetings. Beautiful house, Mr Malhotra! - Thank you. Thank you, so much. - It's really nice. Sister, you're looking exotic! Your suitor will go nuts. I'm scared. - Why? My friend's sister was supposed to get married. And she was so happy. Then, just a day before the wedding the boy called off the wedding. She couldn't take it. She committed suicide. What if it happens to me? Even I.. - Are you crazy? Don't you ever think about it! Come on, Priya. Karan, you aren't dressed yet? Hurry up! - I'll be there in a moment. Come, dear. - Mom.. You're looking lovely. Don't be apprehensive. Come, dear. She's my daughter. - Greetings, dear. Greetings. - Come, sit with us. - Sit. Beautiful, isn't she? Mr Malhotra, We approve of the bride. - Yes. I accept this alliance. - Thank you. The girl and the boy ought to meet each other, so we came. I always wanted my son's bride to belong to a cultured family like yours. - You are kind. We received proposals for him from rich families. Then we found out about wayward brothers and faulty fathers. But I'd never want an alliance with families of that sort. Of course. Come son. This is my son. - Is it? You? This ruffian! Is he your son? What are you saying? My son is a perfect gentleman. I saw that with my own eyes, when he wrecked my car. What is he saying, son? - Dad, it was a mistake. Mistake? Gentlemen might make mistakes but not ruffians. Let's leave. We won't have anything to do with them. I apologise for that day, sir. Please do not annul this alliance! I beg of you! My sister is a gem. Karan, what are you doing? Out of my way! If you have any reservations about my sister then let me tell you a fact. I'm not her brother. Let me speak, Dad. This concerns my sister's life. I can't let this alliance get severed because of me. Believe me I'm an orphan! They fostered me. They cared for me like a son! But I am not her brother. Certainly not! - Not only a ruffian you are also a bastard! - Khanna! You have spoken enough, you made my son grovel. Scoundrels like you aren't welcome in my house. I'd never give you my daughter. Get out! I said, get out! Why are you so glum? Get on with your drink. Dad, you know. I don't drink. - I know. But to get you drunk I've nearly finished it. And you haven't touched it? Come on. Come on, have it. Slow down. At least drink that much. Come on, that's my boy! A wee bit more. Here, you go! I know it's bad! A father mustn't make his son drink. Now, swear by your heart and tell me who am I to you? - Dad. And who are you to me? - Son. Why did you tell Khanna that you aren't my son? The situation was so compelling. - Is it? Would that make a son deny his father? Can compulsions wreck relationships? You'd rather stab me in the heart. I didn't mean to hurt you, Dad. You didn't? But you tore my heart into pieces. Swear it by me, have I ever denied you my love? Never. - Then why? Never will I speak of it again, I swear. If ever you say it again you will kill your Dad. Remember. - No, never. Let's go home. Help me get up! Can't walk on my own anymore! Where's our car? Over there. - Where? Is the car drunk, too? Look, I'll drive, all right? No Dad, I'll drive. - Silly! You're drunk. I'll drive it safely. - No, I'm driving it. All right, if you insist. I'll sit here or is it the boot? Not the boot. Let's go! Dad, are you comfortable? - Yes. If you come across Khanna, run him over, all right? I drink because my wife heckles me! Does she drive you mad? - Yes. She drives me nuts. - Why is that? Because I'm hustling the neighbour's wife. Why? - Because I like her. Okay, I'll leave. Seema, you're way out! You come up with such fresh ideas. This episode on drunkards is a hit. - Enough of it now. Let's pack up! Look, 2 drunks are travelling in a stationary car. Let's interview them. Goodness! That's Karan! Karan, are you fine? Karan? Karan, are you fine? Please take him to my car. Great story. And what about the climax? - It'll take time. Thank you, bye. - Okay, bye. This watch? Where did you get it? Nice, isn't it? From my boyfriend. Boyfriend? Who? - Karan. I introduced you to him at the party. Karan. He's a great guy. How long have you been in love? - Ever since we met. It was love at first sight. I couldn't read your love story because of time constraints. So is it your real love story? Yes. - Who is he? - He was. What do you mean? - Now he belongs to someone else. Strange! You wrote your story despite knowing that he loves someone else? Are you so deeply in love? Yes, dearly. Your love is great, Puja! But not that guy who never understood you. And now, he belongs to someone else. I'm sure, my Karan would never do that to me. I pray to God, whatever happened to me may never happen to you. I'll see you, later. Bye. Hello? - Karan, I have one of your possessions. What is it? Where did you find this watch? Last night you weren't in your senses. Where are you at the moment, Seema? - Central Library. I'll be right there. Karan, you have no idea how much I love you. I love you. And today I'll confess my love to you. I love you a lot. Seema? Seema! Seema! Please, Seema! Please give me the watch, Seema. - Pining for a watch so trivial? It's not something trivial. It holds my heartbeats. It's my life. So your life's in my hands. If I wish, I won't ever let it go. No, I can't give my life to anyone. Because, it holds my love. - Love? I and Pinky loved each other dearly, as kids. That's when she gave me this. And suddenly one day we had to part. Ever since, I've been looking for her. What if you don't find her? - I will surely find her. I'm dead sure, I'll find my love, someday. We made a promise when we were children. - What kind of promise? You will live only for me. And I live only for her. What? You want to go abroad again to study? Yes, Dad. - But you only had decided to study here, isn't it? Yes. But after watching things shape up, I now know that my aim will not be achieved, here. - Which aim? I want to progress, I want to achieve something in life. I'm glad that my daughter assigns her career such high regards. Hello? Hello? - Puja? It's Seema, here. Puja, don't forget to come to my birthday party, tomorrow. I can't make it. - What? I'm flying out tomorrow. - I don't care. You have to come. No, I can't come. - Please Puja, for my sake. Bye. Take care. 'Kiss the person, next to you.' No! - Yes, come on! - It's not possible. Come on, come on, guys! Come on! Yes. - Oh, no! 'Tell us about your love, and sing a romantic song.' What is this? I can't sing! Please leave me! Happy birthday, Seema. You landed your boyfriend in a fix. - Not mine, he's someone else's. But the other day, you said.. - It was my misconception, Puja. Karan is in love with some Pinky, since childhood. For years he has held her watch close to his heart, pining to meet her. "These days, months and years.." "shall pass by, my friend." "But do always remember.." "You will live only for me." "It's a promise. You'll live only for me." "You will live only for me." "These days, months and years.." "shall pass by, my friend." "But do always remember.." "You will live only for me." "It's a promise. You'll live only for me." "You will live only for me." "I wish the passion never ceases." "Let this obsession grow." "I wish we love each other more than anything else." "Let this companionship be forever." "When a million questions" "are asked about our love" "let's just remember" "You will live only for me." "It's a promise. You'll live only for me." "You will live only for me." "Take my hand and walk beside me forever." "Let seasons come and go, but you must never change." "I wish our bond is never severed." "I wish we always remain close to each other." "Be it happiness, or in sorrow." "Come what may." "But do always remember.." "You will live only for me." "It's a promise. You'll live only for me." "You will live only for me." "These days, months and years.." "shall pass by, my friend." "But do always remember.." "You will live only for me." "It's a promise. You'll live only for me." "You will live only for me." Puja, you had promised me that you'd tell me before you tell him. "You will live only for me." True love has won finally, Neeta. I have found my childhood sweetheart. And I've kept my promise, too. I'm breaking the news to you. What? Really? How does he look? - He's so handsome. Do you know? He loves me as much as I love him. He was as desperate to meet me as I was to meet him. But I won't tell him that I'm his Pinky. I pined to find my sweetheart. Now I'll stay close to him and find out how much he pines for me. I want to enjoy it. Karan, I've found you. But until you find me and profess your love I won't tell you that I'm Pinky. I'll wait. Yes! It'll be fun. You? It's you. I just remembered. Are you here to buy a Valentine card? Obviously, it's Valentine's Day today. And you? - Obviously, I'm here to buy one, too. Do you have a girlfriend? - Yes, and no. I mean the day I find her, I'll give her all the Valentine cards that I've been collecting for so long. Who is your boyfriend? - He's right before me. What? - I mean, the day I find him I'll give him all the cards I've been collecting. Which means, you and I are alike. - No, we are one. I didn't get you? - How about eating something? Let's go. - Okay. On our second meeting, I brought you here. Hope you don't mind it, do you? No. But I'm surprised as to what attracted me towards you. Hello. We read your story published in the P9 magazine. You're an incredible writer. - May I have your autograph, please? We're excited to know the climax. I too, am excited to write the climax. When is it being published? Well, I'm working on it. - Okay. All the best, bye. - Bye. Thank you, bye. - Bye. Did you write that story which was published in the P9 magazine? Yes, but I don't think you've read it. No. But my sister has read it. She's a big fan of yours. She'll be happy to meet you. Priya? Priya? Did you recognise her? Puja! Oh, God, I don't believe this. Silly girl! What have you done? Moron! Sorry, dear. I'm sorry. - It's okay. I'll take her inside. - Hurry up. Wash it up. Oh, God! Silly girl! This is my brother's washroom. Thank you. - Welcome. "Sweetheart!" "You're sixteen or seventeen. But you're a terrific lad." "I've fallen for you." "You're seventeen or eighteen. But you're a terrific guy." "You have invaded my heart." "You've intoxicating eyes and breath-taking style." "I fell for you at first sight of yours." "You're obsessed, and I'm lost, too." "My love, I've fallen for you." "You've fair cheeks, you're a terrific lad." "I've fallen for you." "You're seventeen or eighteen. But you're a terrific guy." "You have invaded my heart." "You're the only one, you're beyond compare." "Yours is the name that comes in every tale of mine." "You are in my eyes, in every dream of mine." "You have robbed me off my peace." "My gait seduces you. But you're a terrific guy." "You have invaded my heart." "You're sixteen or seventeen. But you're a terrific lad." "I've fallen for you." So long? Priya must've chewed her brains out. Go, save Puja before she quits writing. - Right away, Mom. Hey, that's brother's night suit. My sleeping suit? My dress got stained, that's why. No problem. Come, have some tea. - No, thanks. I'll leave now. Have something before you leave, dear. - Maybe some other time. Do come. - Would you drop me home? - Sure. Bye! - Go. Stop. - Let us in. Sorry, ma'am. - Let's go, Karan! Won't you come in? - Some other time. I'll return your suit. - No need. It suits you fine. Okay, bye! - Bye. Puja? Dad, he.. - I'm not asking you anything, dear. I want to explain certain things to you. I could've built this grand bungalow anywhere in the city. But why, here? Because this is the costliest place in the city. It speaks of our status. I could've got the furniture made anywhere in India. But why did I import it from Italy? Why from the world's best furniture company? To display our status. Come, Puja. Dear, I only believe in the best. All these cars are the latest models from the best range. Because I know, those who own such vehicles their status and lifestyle would stand out. Of all the universities, why did I send you to Oxford? Because Oxford is the world's best university. Oxford's stamp is on your degree certificate. The very best. Go change your clothes. Don't cry, my baby. Smile like your mother. I'll dice them, give it to me. Hello? You didn't believe me, right? Come over, and see for yourself. What? - Your husband leaving you all is sitting with another family of his. I can't find words to describe. Whatever is to be done, is up to you. Over and out. What are you staring at? - Today, I'm watching tomorrow, the world will watch. - What do you mean? Look.. - It's her! But who is that baby with dad? His second son. Your younger brother. What nonsense! - Don't you believe your eyes? Look at him! The affection he's showing to his second son he must've never shown it to you. You mustn't grieve, Karan. Okay? But you are a goner. A shareholder to your properties has sprung up. He might usurp it all, you never know. Maybe another son is at home. Another on the waiting list, and one more.. Stop it. Mom? How did Mom come here? - I called her over. Bless you! Aren't you ashamed to pee on me? You ought to be ashamed. Now I know where your money goes and where you go on holidays. Gayatri, she.. Why didn't I drop dead? How foolish of me! I worshipped you And you're producing babies with this other woman? Sister, you suspect an angel? You have gravely sinned. Don't you dare call me sister! And of course, he's an angel to you. Yes, he's an angel to me and to thousands of orphans like this baby. It is because of Mr. Mahendra's help that I read them in my orphanage. As for this baby, someone left him at the gate of the orphanage last night. I only brought him here to show Mr. Mahendra. What? Good, Lord! I have gravely sinned by suspecting you. Forgive me. Ma'am, I've wronged you, too. Forgive me It's not your fault. Real culprit is the one who has provoked you. No problem, I'll fix him later. Dad, I'm very proud of you. He's crying. Let me hold him. So cute! I approve of this alliance. - Congratulations, Mr Sharma. So we're related now. Mr Malhotra, let's hold the wedding after the festival of Holi. Hardly any time is left. 1, 2, 3, 4 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Only two days to go. Hey, smile! - You.. "Bringing showers of colours along, the festival of colours is here." "Bringing showers of colours along, the festival of colours is here." Put it on, Priya. - Happy Holi, Puja. - Happy Holi! Happy Holi! No.. I don't play Holi. At least colour my cheeks. - No, please. Let me colour them. - Where's Karan? - Karan hates colours. Where is he? - In his bedroom. - Apply some. No, no please. I'm Puja not Pinky. I thought you were Pinky. Why are you laughing? Am I a clown? This? Who did this? Don't mind. It's Holi, today. "O fair lady, as your veil sways, you blush." "Look behind, your lover comes seeking you." "She sways and slithers.. I can't get her." "Naughty brat, Don't harass me.." "Don't harass me.." "Don't harass me.." Let go of my hand, please. Think it over. If you don't let go, you'll have to hold my arm forever. "It slips off.. My red veil." "My red veil is the heart-throb of my lovers." "Ever since I entered youth.." "I've been wearing the veil." "Ever since I entered youth.." "I've been wearing the veil." "Her veil.." "Now I'm sixteen, and in a bad shape." "Boys chase me, tease me, and harass me." "Boys chase me, tease me, and harass me." "How do you I save myself? Where do I hide?" "Oh, where do I hide?" "Ever since I entered youth.." "I've been wearing the veil." "Yes, my love, I've been wearing the veil." "Her veil.." "Come, marry me, I can wait no more." "Come, marry me, I can wait no more." "Get me the bridal dress, paint my hands in henna." "Get me the bridal dress, paint my hands in henna." "Get me bracelets, marry me." "Get me bracelets." "Ever since I entered youth.." "I've been wearing the veil." "Yes my love, I've been wearing the veil." "Her veil.." "Her veil.." You do know my daughter Puja, right? - I know her quite well. She's one in a million. - I know your son Rahul, too who's one in millions. Mr Khurana I want our friendship to turn into family relation. Fantastic. - So, let's shake hands. No, Dad. I can't get married to him. - Why not? Rahul is my friend's son. He comes from a good family and enjoys a good social status. They're our equals. Dad, it isn't that. - So, what is it? There was someone I fell in love with as a child, Dad. And I've found him now. - What childhood love? Who is he? Karan. - Who's Karan? - Try and recall, Dad. You used to take me to Ooty during my vacations every year. There was a boy there. Karan. - Karan! The vagabond! The orphan! He's no orphan, Dad. A respectable family has adopted him and has given him its name. They've made him their son. Giving him a name or adopting does not change the blood in his veins! Dad, Karan's love flows in my veins. And I can't change it either Shut up, Puja! Just keep quiet! I'm your father and I'm taking the important decisions of your life! Dad, please don't snatch my love from me. I've prayed for years to have him back. I don't want to argue with you, Puja. I don't want any arguments. No pleadings. Listen to me very carefully. If I hear you utter Karan's name again I'll wipe out every trace of him I will finish him. In that case, listen to what I have to say, Dad. Your daughter's life lies in Karan. If something happens to Karan, your daughter won't live either. "My beloved is dark-skinned, to hell with the fair ones." "I'm good enough for him, to hell with the fair ones." Listen, midget. If anyone has complaints about anything I'm going to give you a beating and stretch you to six inches. Dad? I've informed them. - What? The decorator will start the work tonight, itself. Great! Do one thing, son.. - Listen.. Yes, tell me? - You ought to have met Mr Sharma. Mr Sharma? What for? - What do you mean? We didn't ask him how he wanted the wedding procession to be welcomed. Right. This is the last time you've said something sensible. The last time? - You need brains for a first time. And you don't have any brains. - What are you laughing for? Come with me Not among the ladies, go and fetch the plates. I told his mother that Mr Sharma is a gentleman. He's not going to make any demands. And you've honoured my word. Thank you. - Mr Malhotra, you haven't had anything. It's enough that you asked. Did you send for me, sir? Who were the two men who were here to see you? It was Mr Malhotra. Didn't I tell you, sir? I'm getting Rajesh married. It's with Mr Malhotra's daughter. Who was the boy with them? He's the bride's elder brother. Karan What is the matter, sir? Seema, listen to this! Impressed with the popularity of Puja's story, managing committee has decided to make a telefilm out of it! - That's nice, sir. They've also decided that you will handle the project. I? - Yes, you. I haven't even read the story, sir. So go ahead and read it. Hurry up! - Okay, sir. Hi, Seema! You, stupid. You, idiot. It's okay, but why are you crying? - I'm not crying, Karan. It's time for celebration. The Pinky from your childhood has been found! What? Pinky? Where is she? Puja is your Pinky, Karan. Look at this.. She wrote this story only to find you. Puja is my Pinky? - Yes. Hello? - Karan? - Yes, Dad? Come home immediately, son - Why? What's the matter? Something very strange has happened. Come soon. What happened, Karan? - I don't know. I've got to go home immediately. Dad? Mom, what's wrong? Son, the bridal henna hadn't even darkened your sister's hands and our joys have been struck by lightning. Dad, what is mother saying? - It's true, my son. Mr. Sharma called a while ago, he has turned down the marriage. What? - How we would explain to all that why the groom's side refused to go ahead with the marriage just a day before the wedding? But why did he do this, Dad? - That's what I wanted to know but he disconnected the phone call. All your father has earned in his lifetime is respect, son. And I'm losing even that today. Mr. Sharma? You take the matters pertaining to marriage to be a joke, is it? Being a groom's father doesn't mean that you can play with our honour. We are a respectable family, too. If you want to have your sister married you'll have to forget Puja. You've got to decide this right now. Do you value your love more than your sister? Hello? - Hello, Puja, it's Karan. I want to meet you right now, Puja. What for? Today I want to tell you, how I feel. His feelings! I'm at the Marriot Hotel. You can come over and meet me at the poolside. Karan this is the day, I've always waited for. I love you, Karan. "I've found the love of my life." "Praise the Lord!" "I've found the love of my life." "Praise the Lord!" "My heart now finds peace." "Praise the Lord!" "Spring this time drives my heart crazy." "Praise the Lord!" "What intoxication takes over me?" "Praise the Lord!" "I didn't tell anyone." "But my heart always beat for you." "Without me, you were in bad shape." "And I, too, pined for you." "Nowhere could I find peace, my love." "Loneliness gnawed at my heart every moment." "Everywhere around me" "were memories of you." "I longed to meet you every moment." "Praise the Lord!" "I longed to meet you every moment." "Praise the Lord!" "I've found the love of my life." "Praise the Lord!" "I only prayed for days and nights" "that we meet at the earliest." "May the bridal music play at our union." "May we have a bridal procession." "There's no one here, except you and I." "No shackles of the world bind us anymore." "Come, let me take you in my arms." "I can't take these distances anymore." "My beloved is so very innocent." "Praise the Lord!" "My beloved is so very innocent." "Praise the Lord!" "I've found the love of my life." "Praise the Lord!" "My heart now finds peace." "Praise the Lord!" Karan. I can't take it anymore, Karan. I know what surprise you want to give me. I love you, Karan. I love you. Ever since I saw you at the party I've fallen in love with you. - At the party? Yes, Puja. Your love has driven me crazy. I feel as if I just can't live without you. But.. Seema told me that you live only for Pinky, your childhood love. I was a kid then. As a kid, I made friends with Pinky we played together and forgot all about it. I was never in love with Pinky. I met her as a child. She might belong to someone else. And am I mad to fall in love with her without even seeing her? She could be fat and ugly for all I know. Which means you love a girl only for her beauty not for her heart. Absolutely! It's beauty you fall in love with, because you see it. You can't look into someone's heart whether it's good or bad, can you? You're right. You can't look into anyone's heart to know how evil it is! But why've you started crying, Puja? Not Puja. I'm Pinky. What? - Yes, the one you think is Puja is actually Pinky. I wish I had seen through you as a kid. The one I love is not worthy of even my hatred. What a mess! If I knew you're Pinky, I wouldn't have proposed you, at all. But that's all right. You're the one I love, after all. Which is why I never separated the token of your love from me. No! The truth about you has now been exposed to me. You just can't fall in love with someone! You have no right to keep someone's token of love! I hate you, Karan! What are you made of? For my sake, you won't tell anyone about this. Thank God, we have escaped getting a bad name. Son! - This is a miracle. I don't know who did it. Mr Sharma called and apologised profusely. Our honour has been restored. - Go and meet Priya, son. She just can't believe it. Hurry up and go to her. Priya? Brother! I'm so happy, brother. I'll be back, brother. "Don't mind, but it's the festival of colours!" Hello? - Hey, Puja! Puja, we've decided to make a telefilm on your love-story. So quickly write it's climax and give it to us. I'm sorry, Seema. I can't write the climax. Get someone else to write it. - What? But why? Seema, had I known that this would be the climax of my love-story I wouldn't have started writing my love-story, in the first place. I don't get it. Suffice it to say that my story has ended before its climax. I can't write it, I'm sorry. Here's everything for the ceremony, priest. Sweets and fruits. Is there anything else you want? No, nothing more. Do let me know if you need something. Veer, where's Karan? He's gone out. Veer, you've been Karan's childhood friend. He hides nothing from you. Karan and Puja have loved each other from their childhood. And now, there's this problem? Karan has bound me in an oath. But I want to see him happy. It's Puja's father who has created all the problems. What do you mean? The guy Karan's sister is marrying was educated and brought up, thanks to Puja's father. His father works for Puja's father. This is what Puja's father took advantage of. And Karan made the sacrifice. He sacrificed his love for his sister. This is the truth, Puja. I'm proud of my love. Karan is such a great guy. Seema, I want to go to Karan, right now. What do you think, dear? I placed a special order with Tiffani and Company for it. Let's go, Seema. Puja, where are you going? - To Karan. I'm walking out. Puja, listen to me! You played dirty with me and tried to snatch my love from me. But now I'm going to my love for good. - Puja! Are you out of your mind? You're leaving me and these luxuries for that low-level life? Dad! You got this swanky bungalow built on the city's prime property. Maybe it measures up to your level, not mine. These Mercedes and Porsche cars must belong to your level, too. Not mine. This daughter of yours is giving up things of your level and going to her love. The vows are over. You are now man and wife in joys and sorrow. Karan! I love you. You shouldn't have come here, Puja. I've got to know the truth, Karan. My dad played very dirty tricks to separate us. He put pressure on Mr. Sharma and had Priya's marriage annulled. For your sister's happiness, you sacrificed your childhood love for which you and I have always waited. Why did you do that, brother? I could've married anyone. But you wouldn't have found your love again. Karan, you made such a great sacrifice? My son, what debt have you repaid me for? What are you talking about, Dad? Not even in seven lifetimes can children repay their parents' debt. I didn't do anyone a favour. I merely did my duty. But your sense of duty has enslaved me to you for a thousand lifetimes. Not even my own son would have made such a huge sacrifice. You're forgetting something, Dad. You made me promise that I would never say such thing. So what makes you say it today? I'm sorry, my son. It slipped out of my tongue. Puja! Bastard! You think you will succeed in your designs? Sir, I've done nothing. - You have betrayed me! You are the one who has betrayed us, Dad. What do you want to achieve by all this? Is this your way of giving your daughter some happiness? No, you're instead snatching her happiness from her! Puja, come with me. Just come with me. Let me go! Karan! Karan! Let go of me! After the vows, the bride goes to her husband's house. Not her father's! What rubbish are you talking? What vows? Which vows? The vows you are about to witness. Priest, solemnise the wedding. Karan, my son! Start the CPR. Karan! Karan! Karan! "I've found the love of my life." "Praise the Lord!" "My heart now finds peace." "Praise the Lord!" "Spring this time drives my heart crazy." "Praise the Lord!" "What intoxication takes over me?" "Praise the Lord!" "Be close to me always." "Come what may, don't ever change." "I wish our bond is never severed." "I wish we always remain close to each other." "Be it happiness, or in sorrow." "Come what may." "But do remember, one thing." "You will live only for me." "You will live only for me." "You will live only for me." "You will live only for me."
