Police have not released a statement, but witnesses claim that the murder victims were mutilated, and upon their chests was carved the Scar of David, the calling card of the Hanukiller. Authorities fear the Hanukiller will strike again tonight and urge people to stay indoors, for tonight is Zot Hanukkah, the eighth and final night of Hanukkah, the final seal of the high holiday season of Yom Kippur, and it's considered the time to repent, out of love of God. In other news-- - Obie. Obie. Obie. Obediah, where are you? Where are you? Come, come to me. Come to me. Obie? Obie, Obie! - Sit, sit. Here. - Obie! Come to me! Obie, come to me! Come to Mommy. Come to Mommy! Obediah! Come to me. Come to me. Come to me! - For you, only for you. - Knife! Step away from the kid! - What's up with your hair? You're like a werewolf. - American werewolf in your hiney. - You wish. It's fuckin' freezing. Why don't you put the top up? - Why you take your fuckin' top off, Amanda? - Why don't you take it off for me, Steven? - All right, don't mind if I do. All right. Yeah. - Told you, Aunt Flo is visiting. - Aunt Flo? Who's Aunt Flo? Fuck Aunt Flo. - Aunt Flo! - Got it, don't care. - Oh! Good. It's time for you to earn your living. - No strings attached. - Just go around it. Ah, yeah. Oh put your pee pee in me, just do it, just do it. - It's open. - Where's Josh? - In the shower. - Why? - Because we fucked. What kind of a stupid question is that? - But why are we letting him bail on the party? - Well, it's either a nice Hanukkah dinner with his girlfriend's mother or a wild booze-soaked fuck fest. You try convincin' Super Jew to come with us. - What's up, David? Kickin' it with the heathen, I see. - Yes, I'm a bad Jew. - That's okay. Even a bad Jew serves God. - Yes, I'm a bad example for the rest of the Jews. David and I were actually just talking about how you're pussy-whipped and ditching your friends, tonight. - Wait, you said that about me? Now I'll have to go just to prove you wrong. - Nice fuckin' bathrobe. - So you're letting Rachel drag you to her mom's place for dinner, huh? - Actually, Mrs. Horowitz called and invited me personally. Rachel didn't even want to go. - Yeah, Rachel's mom adores Josh. It's like he's so Jewish that it negates the fact that he's black. - You know, I don't know what the best part about living with you is, the fact that you're a racist or that you're a self-hating Jew. - Maybe it's 'cause I wear pants. Go put some fuckin' pants on. Walkin' around like a flasher. It's weird, right? - Oh, a little, um , so Josh and Rachel are getting pretty serious, huh? - Oh my God, you're jealous. - What? No, dude, I'm just-- - No, I get it. Mrs. Horowitz never really gave you a chance. And usually when a girl's mom doesn't like you, it makes them want you more, like a forbidden fruit. But too late now. Once you go black , well, in this case, it's Josh, but she's not going back. Even circumcised, it's probably huge. - Didn't you say that Rachel didn't want to go tonight? - No, Rachel wanted to go to the party, but Josh sucks. - What are you doing? Can you... What are you doing? What are you gonna do? Please let me go. Please, please, please. Help me! Help me, please! Let me go. Let me go, please, let me. Come on, come on! Um, hello, um, can you, um, can you take this off? This is hurting. Um, hello, can you look at me? Um, what are you doing? What are you doing to me? Please let me go. I want to go home! I want to go home! Please let me outta here! Please, this is hurting me! Please let me go home, please! Please, please. Please let me go. Can you look at me? Can you look at me? Can you look at me? Just look at me. Why, what are you doing? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, please don't, no, no! No, okay, okay, I'm sorry. I'll, I'll stop, I'll stop, I'll stop, I'll stop. - Joshua, hello. - Hello, Mrs. Horowitz. Is Rachel already here? I couldn't get her on the phone and-- - I know. She phoned to let us know she wouldn't be joining us. But you're still staying for dinner, right? - I, yeah, I guess, if you still want me to. - Totally. - Okay. - So, wait, you didn't even tell Josh you're coming to the party? - I'm sure after a couple glasses of Manischewitz with my mom, he'll get the picture. - You see it? They're fucking. Are you serious? What happened to Melissa? - Fuck Melissa. - Rachel's not even gay. - You're gay. - Okay. - What are you doing? - I'm calling Josh. - Why? - Because we're all trying to fuck his girlfriend. - Don't worry, hon, David and Judy are the only ones who stand a chance. And Josh, he wouldn't even know what you're talking about because he doesn't even want to fuck his girlfriend. He's waiting to fuck his wife. And that ain't gonna be me. - What are you guys talkin' about? - Adam wants to call Josh. - Yeah, you remember Josh, right? - Yeah. Yeah , definitely call Josh. He should come. It is, uh, it's a two-hour drive, though. Do you really think he wants to do that by himself? - Well, he was invited. He just didn't wanna come. - Case closed. - So Rachel and Josh haven't even sealed the deal yet? That's crazy. How long have they been together? Is he like a virgin or something? - That would make a lot of sense. Hey, hey Bitch, you ain't got shit on me Queen D, yeah, the crown only fit on me That's why, that's why your man wanna feel on me He's fucking you, his mind still on me - Fuckin' move before I pee myself. - You got the fuckin' the bladder of a nine-years-old girl. - You have tit of a nine-year-old boy.

Is Ian's party. I go there, too. - You're going to the party? - Yes. - Are you going with Boris and Natasha? - Yes, I am. - What the fuck is she doing? - Just follow me. - Okay. Thanks for nothing. Let's go. - Let's go. - Hey, guys, guess who's coming to the party. - Hey, they're going to the party, too. - Gonna be great. - No way! No, you're not invited them to Ian's. - Shut the fuck up. I did not invite them. They were already going. - Hey, don't tell her to shut the fuck up. And you eat that shit, Little Debbie - They drove two hour from the city. - They drove two hours. You ain't got shit on me - Two hours? Aw, you are so caring for them. Bitch, you ain't got shit on me Queen D, yeah, the crown only fit on me - Nina, quit being a bitch, let's just go. You don't have to talk to them. Come on! - No, you have two choices. You either tell them to fuck off, or you're taking me home now! - Wrong! I have a third choice. I tell you to fuck off! - Are we just gonna leave her here? - Well, we could pick her up. - Let's vote on it. - Nay. - Nope! - I just didn't want to be a cunt first. Nay. - You guys are fucked up. - Bye, Felicia. - Hey, Yuri left me at the gas station, and my purse is still in the car. I have no money. Call me as soon as you get this. - Some fuckin' gay bathhouse. - There's room on the couch if you guys wanna sit down. - You should have brought Nina. - No! I still have the other. Don't disrespect Nina like that. Show some respect. - Hey, what's up, guys? - Nothing is up, 'cause this is a fucking sausage fest. - I know, I know. I made some phone calls. Don't worry. - Oh. The boy made phone calls, oh. - Where's Nina? - See, your fallback plans in case it's a sausage buffet. - Yeah, your kind of buffet , oi. - Hey, guys, where's Josh? - He couldn't make it. - Bullshit. Get his ass down here. - Right, 'cause that's what this party needs. More cock! - That was great. Rachel doesn't know what she missed. - She does tend to take things for granted, a pitfall of youth. I have a confession to make. I knew Rachel would not come tonight. I know my daughter very well, the advantage of experience. So tell me, Josh, how serious are you and Rachel? - Serious, very serious. - When Mr. Horowitz passed away, it was very difficult for me. I almost thought of selling this house. It's very, very lonely here. - I can't sleep with you. - What? - Leviticus 20:14, "And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness." - Take a wife and her mother? - You know, take her. - All right, Joshua, I know what you meant. I'm familiar with Leviticus. - I haven't even slept with Rachel. I'm waiting until I'm married. I mean, of course, I'd love to bed you right now. That, that would be great, but staying with the spirit of the law. - Joshua, I am not trying to seduce you. I wanted to tell you, if you intend on marrying my daughter, I would make a wedding gift of this house. No more wine for you. - Oh God. - I'm pretty sure they're gonna notice the only two girls at the party are missing. - Yeah, well, I told Ian that we're using his sister's bathroom. He thinks I'm going to call my girlfriends and have 'em come to the party. Yeah, right. - What girlfriends? - This bitch has her own wardrobe rack. Hello. Yes! - I think Ian's sister might mind you going through all her shit. - Uh, as much as she'd mind you putting your boots on her pillow. Whore! I mean, come on. Oh yes, come on, let's try some shit on. - Mm, no. - Yes! - Mm, no. - Ah! Bingo, bitch. - That dress looks a little too small for you. What, is Ian's sister like 12? - Like a 12-year-old could afford this. She's our age. But she's not thinner than I am. - Right. - Yes. - Yeah, great, let me help you with this. - Okay. Yes. Let's do this. Try something on, come on. Yes. This one. - Mm? - Yes. - No, no. - It's so fucking cute. What are you talking about? - Not really. - Here, what about this? - Mm, no, it's too small, no. - It's not too fuckin' small. - Yeah, it is. - Fuck off! - Try another one. - Yuck, gross. - Yeah. - What a whore. - No. - Nice, okay. Yes. - Mm, no. No, no, no, no. - I'm , I'm not into girls. - That's not what you said in the car. You told Adam that David and Judy have a shot. - I was joking. - Come on, hook me up. - Do you think I'm a slut? - Yeah. What? - I was joking. - Come on. Just hook me up one time. - Yuck, gross. You smell like Patron in here. Slut. I wish I had a woman that I could destroy 'Cause then I guess that I'd be satisfied - Not a single lesson. - Good, that's good. What are you, wizard? Are you Harry Potter? Show me mark, show me mark. Oh, is no mark. Drink, drink. - Oh, no. - This will give you mark. Drink! Oh yes, papa. Good, good, you're ready for party now. Oi, no hope for you. I need a woman to listen to lies And then I guess that I'll be satisfied Satisfied Then I guess that I'll be satisfied - Hey, buddy, she's not home. I don't know who this tattoo chick is, but Cheryl's gonna be pissed when she gets back. I'm not judgin'. Leave your curtains opened, fuckin' askin' to be a star. I see her when she's sleepin' You know, I sold her pictures to some porno voyeur site. So fuckin' hot. This is what you just missed. I was lucky to catch this broad dancin' around with her titties out. Fetch a pretty fuckin' penny. You're probably more excited about the penny, though, huh? Get it? 'Cause you're a Jew. I was just fuckin' with ya. I know, I look like an asshole. I just got off work, a mall Santa. What are you like, some sort of moral Jew? You some sort of fuckin' Hanukkah Harry or somethin'? Oh, we're pullin' 'em out? - If your gifts and your skills are a result of my blood running through your veins, if the moon intensifies your abilities and sharpens your survival instincts, or if my mother is right, and it is not a biological mutation transferable by blood but a curse, in which case, I hope you still respect your place on the food chain! - Struck out? - Anyone else show up? - Nope. What's on? - It was this "Christmas Evil" or "Silent Night, Deadly Night." I went with this. We need more Jewish horror films. "The Last Synagogue on the Left," pray you're not one of the chosen people. "Gefilte Flesh," you'll bleed a latka. Wow, these write themselves. I could do this all night. - Please don't. - How long are we stuck here? - Well, I think David told Ian that we were here for the night. - What the fuck? I thought we were only gonna stay if the party was worthwhile. - Damn you, man, open up! - Didn't we have an escape clause if the party sucked? - Come on, open up. - Yeah, but David's our ride, and it doesn't suck for him. - But this is Ian's parents' room. - I know, it's the best bed in the house. Oh why are you so sexy? I'm not a slut. - No. - Okay. Josh could never know. - No. - Josh, I know my daughter can be spirited. Perhaps I spoiled her after her father passed. But I think you are good for her. - I'm not so sure Rachel thinks so. She's not even here. - Well, she's grown accustomed to indulging her whims, a custom you need to help her break. This jewelry has been in my family for many generations. There is much history in this box. When God led my mother safely out of Europe, she was wearing this ring. These belonged to her parents. And these were my great-grandparents'. My mother made many sacrifices to keep these in her possession. I think when you ask Rachel for her hand, it would mean a lot if you presented her with one of these rings. See anything you like? - Oh yeah, oh yeah! Oh God. Oh fuck me. Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me with that tiny dick! Oh yeah. Fuck me with that tiny, tiny microdick! Fuck with that microdick, white boy. I can't even fuckin' feel it. I can't even fuckin' feel it. Fuck me with that microdick. Yeah, fuck me, yes! Yeah - This party suck so bad even the fuckin' nerds left. 10 years in the making Nobody quit - No, I call you as soon as I hear something. Have you seen Amanda? - No. - I told you I'll call you. - She's looking for her cousin Amanda. - Ah, very hot. Amanda is coming here? - She's supposed to. She's with Steve. You know Steve? So what's going on? - I don't know. No one heard from her since the last night. I just found out about it an hour ago, after I had to take cab home to pick up my car. If Amanda or Steve show up or you hear something from them, call me. My aunt is freaking out. So cute. - Nina. Next time you decide to throw a party, invite some single women. I mean, this is bullshit. - Oh, Yuri, who needs woman? Oh, oh, oh, oh! - Stop this. Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel I'm gonna make you gay - I do not like this. Stop this, it's not funny. - Yeah, it's really not. And this is an antique, and it's my mother's. So if you could... Don't touch me. - Then you could play with it. - Let go. - Or you could have your mother come and play with it. - Stop. - Okay, that was funny. - Okay, uh, need to go and pee. Give me antique back. - Hey, you piss too much. Next time you have a party, invite single women. 1.50 for the quarter Three for the half Six for the O with a pink giraffe One for the nickel Two for the dime 20 for the dub of that bubba kind - I fuck you, plant. And I fuck you. I am Hebrew, the most powerful Jew in the universe. And I make you big pussy. Who opened the window? Fuckin' winter, it make my pee pee small. Mine is bigger than yours. You hear me. Mine is bigger. - Ivan, let's go, enough pissing! Ivan. Ivan. What the fuck? Fuck him. Ivan, you piece of shit, if you're with Nina, you might as well both kill yourselves and save me the trouble. - That, ladies and gentlemen-- - Are you threatening me? - Eternity of despair. - Man of fine fashion. - Hey. You may wanna see this. It's like, it's like the most offensive thing I've ever seen. No one's ever gonna believe this. - You must be Baby Bear. - Get the fuck outta my bed. Get the fuck outta my clothes. - Now we're talking. You first. - Oh. Who the fuck gets drunk and dresses up in a stranger's wardrobe? - In all fairness, I was sober when I tried your clothes on. I didn't start drinking until after I got in bed. I'm so sorry. It's fucking three in the afternoon. Why didn't someone come wake me up? - Sounded like someone did. Besides , figured you'd wanna sleep in, considering we're stranded here. - Did they leave without us? - No, all four of Dave's tires got slashed. And, uh, they just messed with the engine for good measure. - Oh no. - Yeah. They think maybe the Russians did it or that crazy chick they left at the gas station. She came by here, all bent out of shape. I'm going with karma, though. - What do we do now? - Well, Ian said we could crash here until tomorrow night. - Tomorrow night? - Yeah, uh, Josh is observing the Sabbath. It's Friday. He can't, you know, go out, can't drive a car, can't get him wet, can't eat after midnight. - Why doesn't he just come now? - He doesn't want to get stuck in traffic. From sundown to night, until there's three stars in the sky, Saturday night, he can't do anything. Bro's just gonna be kickin' back, thinkin' about God, like a good Jew. - Why three stars? - I don't know. They make it up. But it's either pay for a $200 cab ride or kick it here. That's what I thought. - Isn't this beautiful? It's one of my favorite places. It's so peaceful. You know, son, when people die, sometimes, we sing the Kaddish, but I think the Kaddish is a very mournful, sad song. I like the the Shema. Do you like the Shema? You know how to sing it? You did it! You've heard it before. You were great. You were great. It means God, hear our prayer. He keeps us safe and strong. Always safe when you sing the Shema, you're always safe. - What are you looking at? You like this? You sick fuck. You're gonna let me go? You're gonna let me go? Is that it? You're gonna let me go. What are you lookin' at? It's Friday, Sabbath. Fuck! Come on, come on, come on. Come on. Fuck you, motherfucker! Somebody help me! - Really? - What? - What the fuck? You need to get them the fuck outta here. - Where are they supposed to go? - I don't give a fuck where they go. They can go to the fucking 200, for all I care. - Why a zoo? - This bitch stole my clothes. She's still wearing 'em. Hey, is that mine, too? They better be gone by the time I get back. - She's gonna want to burn those panties. Hey, don't pretend like you guys didn't fuck, on account of me. - Please get me out of here! Ah! Fuck! Ow. Oh God! - Is that Cheryl's outfit? - Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. - Oh, what's up, dude? - Yo, what's up? - Josh. - What's up, man? Good to see you. - What's up? - What's up? So, got nothin' to say about ditchin' me and your mom? - Nope. - What is wrong with you? How could you do that to me? - Dude, so shitty. What was she thinking? - She was thinkin' about herself and what feels good at the time. I mean, that's all she cares about And you, you knew. You didn't even call to gimme a heads up. Some friend. - He found out that David and Rachel fucked? - What? - Actually, we haven't got to that part yet. - Does anybody want any nachos or anything like that? I could... - How could you do this to me? - Get over it. Nobody forced you to stay for dinner. - You slept with David? - I also have pizza rolls, jalapeño poppers. - I could totally go for those poppers, by the way. Hey! Forgot your jacket. Come on, man, fine. Can you just give me and Judy a ride home? We didn't fuck Rachel. Okay, Judy did try. But I think she only got to second base. Okay, fine, just give me a ride home then. You know, we waited around an extra night for you to sit around on your Sabbath, and I'm still wearin' the underwear I put on three days ago. Come on, we could've just called a cab if you weren't gonna pick us up. - How big of you to wait around all night for me to drive out here and pick you up. You people deserve each other. - What do you mean you people? - You mock my beliefs, and in the same breath, you ask for help. You watch as my girlfriend not only cheats on me with another guy but with another girl, no less. - Well, I didn't watch. Okay, when she was with Judy, I tried to watch. And that's the other thing. With all this and with another woman no less crap, I mean, it doesn't say in the Torah anywhere that women can't be with other women. It says nothing about lesbians. - It was clear what was meant though. - Yes, so clear, in fact, that it's itemized quite specifically. Men can't lay with other men, can't have sex with your mom, can't have sex with your dad, can't have sex with your aunt, your uncle, your sister-in-law, your daughter-in-law, and the biggest bummer is you can't have sex with a woman and her mom at the same time. Nowhere does it say shit about women lying with other women. It's a weak-ass interpretation of Leviticus don't do what the fuckin' Egyptians do. I mean, wow, could you be any more vague? You selectively follow this book verbatim and suddenly when it's convenient for you, there's a little wiggle room, for you to just judge others. I'm sick of it, man. - I'm giving you my month's notice. I'm moving out. - Whatever. - Wow. My hero. I gotta remember that one for my parents. - It's true. Even God loves girl-on-girl. It's a beautiful thing There's plenty of Ortho-dykes out there, you know. I think you're still fucked, 'cause of your tattoos. - So what do we do now? Are we gonna call a cab or wait for Dave's car? - Just can't believe Josh came all the way out here and didn't give us a ride. - I can't believe he came all the way out here and didn't take his wallet. - Pretty sure stealing's a sin. I'll let it slide. Well, Josh went home. Judy and I are gonna get a cab, if you guys want to get in on that. - Dude, my car's gonna be ready first thing Monday morning. I'm not paying for a cab both ways. Why don't we just stay another night? I mean, if that's cool. - Okay, you don't have to worry about Josh. He's not the violent type. - Rachel, what? No, I don't have a ride, Monday. What are you talking about? - Okay. Pussy. - Bitch. - Hello. Oh, hey, what's up? Yeah, no, this isn't a really good time. Yeah, they're still here. No, you don't need to come, hello? Oh. So listen, uh, that was Nina, and she's coming over. - Gross. - Oh fuck! - You know what? I don't wanna hear it, okay? She didn't fuck up your car. She is my guest, just like all of you. So either you could eat my jalapeño poppers and shut the fuck up, or you can get a cab and get the fuck out of here! What the fuck? Cheryl, stop putting a show on for the neighbor! What is she... Cheryl! Fuck. What are you doing out here? Ah, it's freezing. Stop being so dramatic. They didn't steal all your clothes. Hello? - My name is Amon Feist. - Hello, pretty boy. Hello, whore. - Hey, Ian. That Russian chick and some creepy rabbi are here. And I let them in. Oh yeah. - So what are you gonna tell him? - About what? - Rachel, this is serious. Josh is my friend. - What's going on? - He turned off half of the lights, and now he's going through all of Ian's shit. - Oh, cool. Popper? - No. - Okay. - Hey, me and Adam are probably gonna call a cab. You guys in? - I don't know. Can you just give us a second? - I'm in. - Okay. We can't find Ian anywhere. Do one of you have his cell phone number, so we can just call him and let him know that we're leaving? - What do you mean you can't find him? - The backdoor was opened. Adam thought he might've gone to the store, but his car's here, so I don't know. Maybe Cheryl finally killed him. - How much longer are we supposed to wait? Where is this, this young man that I'm supposed to talk to? - Ian? Uh, I think Judy went to go look for him. - What about you? Do you know anything about her cousin's boyfriend Steve? I was really hoping that you would have a different answer. Have you ever heard the name Judah Lazarus? He was also known as the Hanukiller. - Oh, from that cheesy TV movie, with, uh, Mark Harmon and, oh, who was the detective? Uh, he was that guy, it's on the tip of my tongue. - He was a psychopath. He believed that God spoke to him and gave him 53 additional commandments to follow. - Robert Forster! He was, uh, he was the detective for the, the movie. - My father was his third victim, so it was only natural that I took an interest in the case. - Naturally. - His signature mark was called he Scar of David. On men, like my father, he carved it into their chest. On women, he carved it into their bellies. - Maybe 'cause he didn't want to mess up the, uh... - I believe that your friends are dead. - Come again. - If not dead, then most certainly they have been chosen. - What? Chosen by who, for what? What the fuck are you talkin' about? - The victim at the gas station was found with the Scar of David carved into his chest. - Well, I, I don't know anything about that. - The gas station we met at. There was a murder there, that night. I believe I met the killer. Ivan and your friend the whore saw him as well. No one saw Ivan since the party. So we thought maybe she had some information. The police wants to talk to her as well. So I called Ian to get her contact info, but when she said you were here, we wanted to talk to you first. - Why? - My cousin is missing. - If she is still alive, it won't be for long. So I was really hoping to get some information regarding either Steve or the person that was at the station the night that you were there. Do you know what Judah Lazarus was doing moments before the police shot and killed him? He was in the middle of ritually sacrificing his only son, eight-year-old Obediah. Obediah survived. And after months of psychiatric evaluation, he was placed into a foster care, and I kept track of him, because I empathized with him. Both our lives had been shattered by his father's madness. There were so many times that I thought about reaching out to him. I never did. Now years have gone by. There's no trace of him. - Well, maybe he changed his name. Obediah? - No, I'm, I'm certain that it is he who is targeting your friends. - Okay. - Ask me why. - Why? - Because he thinks you're bad Jews. You don't follow the laws of Judaism, according to his interpretation. He thinks you're enemies of the Jewish faith and that he has been chosen by God to enforce the will of God. - I gotta, I gotta make a call. Judy, where'd you guys go? I need to talk to you. This fuckin' crazy shit is goin' on here, and I'm ready to take off, like fucking now. Call me! Ian, you need to get back here, right now, 'cause I'm takin' off, and I'm not taking responsibility for the crazy Russian chick and the weird-ass rabbi that are in your house right now. They're fuckin' weird, man. They're mixed up with the cops and Hanukillers and who knows what else. Call me! Hey! Where's Feist? - He left shortly after you fell asleep. He said he'll come back tomorrow, early. - I'm not waitin' around. I'm goin' home. I didn't see your guy at the gas station. I didn't see shit. I just want to find my friends and get outta here. Where'd you even meet that guy anyway? - He saw Amanda's missing person poster and called me saying he may have some information. - Well, I think he's looking for information, and no offense, but I'm pretty sure he's more interested in finding this Obediah guy than your cousin. Josh, it's me. Just calling to see if you got in touch with David or Rachel. I haven't been able to get a hold of them or Judy or Ian or anybody. Just call me when you get this. Don't be a schmuck and hold a grudge. Serious shit, man. Call me. Did you drive here? - Yeah. - Let's go to the police. Hey! Let's go! Wake up. Let's go to the police station, come on! Come on. - It's very important, as Jews, that we remember we want to be here with our aunties and our uncles and our bubbe and zayde. So we can't adulterate our bodies. We don't do drugs. We don't take alcohol. We don't tattoo ourselves like the hippies do. But don't worry, 'cause Mommy will be with you always, always and forever. Look what I got for you, so that when Mommy's not around, you've got a special friend to keep you company. Don't be afraid. I will be with you always. - No, please, please, stop. Please let me go. Please! Don't, don't. Don't, don't. Please , just let me go. Stop! - So how do you even know you can trust this man Feist? Huh? Maybe he's a lunatic or involved with all this. I mean, he calls you 'cause your cousin's missing, and he tells you these stories. - Police didn't really ask any questions, so they must've checked him out. - Still, why we have to meet him? Why I'm here? I want to know where Ivan is. Where did you come from? - I came in from the back door. It was unlocked. - You, you still coulda knocked. - Yeah, well, you know, Obediah is not gonna be knocking when he comes looking for you. So look your doors and stay alert. - This the guy? - Feist. - Yes, I'm the guy that, uh, you said was a lunatic. - You're lurking around the darkness like a, like a fucking ghoul, bro. - Have, um, any of you seen your neighbors from the blue house next door? Well, um, they might be dead. There's a mezuzah on the outside door frame, and, uh, it wasn't there last night. - So you run around checking the door to see if they're Jews? - Yes. After I left, last night, I walked the neighborhood. So this is what we know. Your friends disappeared, two nights ago. Last night, five more people from this house also disappeared. I was here when three of them remained. So that means, in what, an hour, they were taken with no sign of a struggle and no witnesses. I think it would be difficult to grab all three at once and way too risky if he were to make multiple trips. So I suspect that, like a spider, he lured them into his web. - So why don't you go next door, check if the door is locked? If not, you walk in there as well. - That is exactly what I'm gonna do, because once I saw that newly affixed mezuzah, I walked their property, and I found what I believe is blood in the grass. Hmm. - Shit. - Maybe we should call the police first. - Yes, let's wait for the cops to come while our friends are being slaughtered. - I'm not breaking into someone's house. - Just wait outside. - I know all we have to tell them is that we're breaking and entering, because this rabbi knows there's someone in there who have who may have converted. Why they cover the mirror with the sheets? - You're supposed to cover mirrors during Shiva. It's when you grieve for the dead. - Whoa. You're my woman now? - Yes. I am your woman. - Then hold the coats. Oh bro! I'm sorry. I didn't know. Shit, oh , I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't know. Are you okay? I didn't know. Shit. - Hey, hey, hi. Don't be afraid. Can you see me? You're gonna be okay. Call an ambulance and the police, hurry up. Hi. Hi, hey. Is he still here, in the house? No? What about your friends? Do you know where they are? No? You're gonna be okay. If you can think of anything, it could save your friends' lives. No? Don't cry, take a deep breath. Just let it out. An ambulance is coming. You're gonna be okay. I'm gonna wait here with you, okay? Okay, just I want you to just think. Did he mention anything about where he took 'em? What about a car? Take a deep breath, just relax. Breathe it in. That's good. You're gonna be okay. You're gonna live. You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be playing the piano, okay? Don't cry, shh. Take a breath. Tell me something, please. Is there anything you can tell me that could help to find your ff lends? Anything? Okay, now tell me something that can help me save your ff lends. - Okay, I called the police. The ambulance is on their way. Yuri's with Nina. She's pretty inconsolable, so I wouldn't mention the torture or the punch in the face. What'd she tell you? - Gordon Brook Road, and you're gonna be looking for a red convertible. - Okay. We were just there. That's walking distance from here. There's woods right behind that gas station, remember? It makes perfect sense. She's fine. He's not comin' back. We have to go. You're not gonna go, are you? You're full of shit. You're just a coward. All those speeches I had to listen to, and nothing, you're just gonna wait? Here's your fuckin' jacket. - Okay, fine. - Where's the light? - My job was to save lives. - I get that part, the bear. - Hey! - The question is-- - No! - Where's the knife? - Come on, leave her the fuck alone! Adam! - Whoa, whoa, hey! Whoa, whoa, uh, Lazarus, right, Obediah? Uh, Feist! Henry, Harry? Harvey? - Howard Feist. - Howard Feist, so you do remember? Howard Feist's son, Amon Feist, is looking for you. He came to me, trying to find you. Really, he should be here, but he's scared shitless. I'm scared shitless. I mean, your father killed his father. He ruined both of your lives. Listen, what are you trying to do here? I mean, this isn't Judaism. This is wrong. Your father was delusional. Mitzvot 224, 6:6, you can't be in the same room as a corpse. - Shema. - Mitzvot 225, 6:7, you can't come in contact with with a dead body. You can't kill us. We're all bad Jews, but you're not. - Shema. - I am listening. That's right. I went to rabbinical school to be a rabbi, but it just wasn't for me. You know, you and my roommate, you'd be great together. You like to just sit home and judge other people. How do you justify any of this? - Mitzvot, 637. - Yeah, you see, there's only Your father made up the rest. He just made that shit up. - Mitzvot, 43, 44, 45. - I'm not a false prophet. I'm not anything. What is this? Is that for me? - No. - Adam, it's Judy. No! - God damn you! You're a bad Jew. - Shema! Bad Jew. - Judaism is an affirmation of life, not a rejection of others but a reminder that we all stem from the same family tree branching out in all our diversity, regardless of race or religion. - Nina, still no word on Ivan, but don't worry, we still have time. Hey, Amanda's okay. No, I didn't punch her in the face on purpose. - We are all God's children. "I have set before you life and death, "blessing and curse. "Therefore choose life and both you "and your descendants may life," Devarim. - Rachel! - We are charged with a moral obligation of serving as an example to the world, fulfilling his Will. - Yeah. What is this? Guilt, how cute. No, I don't know. No, I don't care when he gets back. I already told him I'm leaving in a month. - And yes, we're complainers. Remind everyone that as far as we've come, there's always further to go. - Rabbi Feist. Amon, my mom's double parked. We thought you were gonna meet us outside. Rabbi Feist! Family, honor and sadness are speaking these words, 36 years ago, for my dear friend Howard Feist. This, this is the very same paper that I prepared for that day. Amon was his father's son, a good man. When he told me that he too wanted to be a rabbi, I said that for every task a rabbi performs, there's probably someone more qualified. The therapist may offer better counseling. Politician may give more rousing inspirational speeches. A university professor may be a more knowledgeable teacher. None of that matters. Rabbis aren't meant to be above anyone, but to rather stand with everyone. People look to rabbis for affirmation of life, for faith, for understanding. And I'm privileged to serve in that role, every day. I'm gonna miss him, too, Z'ev. If there's anything you need, if anything, you want to talk, anything. - Thank you, Walter. Oh, the yarmulke. It was a gift from Amon. I once told him that he had a better chance of getting me to a baseball game than temple. - Mets, huh? You know your brother and your father were Yankee fans? - Well, look where that got 'em. - I guess I'll see ya at the cemetery. - Someday, I suppose. Oh Hanukkah, oh Hanukkah Come light the menorah Let's have a party We'll all dance the hora Gather 'round the table We'll give you a treat A dreidel to play with and latkes to eat And while we were singing The candles were burning low One for each night as they shed a sweet light They remind us of years long ago One for each night as they shed a sweet light They remind us of years long ago Whoa And while we were singing The candles were burning low One for each night as we shed a sweet light They remind us of years long ago One for each night as we shed a sweet light They remind us of years long ago One for each night as we shed a sweet light They remind us of years long ago One for each night as we shed a sweet light They remind us of years long ago Remind Remind
