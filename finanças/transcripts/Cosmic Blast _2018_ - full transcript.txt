When? When i told you Our supplies are running low how am i supposed to know what that meant What else is that supposed to mean I don't know how about using Quantative Adjatives Like number I don't know, how am i supposed to know what the relitive low means low means few we had few, now we have zero is that enough of a number for you? Zero we have rope how about using five or three? One! One rope what does that mean? It does not matter sir My name is now NAT as you requested well uh NAT Tell me about yourself I was constructedby request of the great Czar Checkov I was the most life like model for two years before being replaced I was then modified and repurposed for use in the kitchen of the great palace until the great rebelion I was then given to Czar Checov's son as he escaped in this vessel with two other more advanced models I was placed in storage and forgotten That's... not good... uh, its fine don't fall down from that big box and break your neck Oh by the way, we are running out of straps there is no down in space you can't fall down off a box in space don't get me started on this debae again because the up and down concept is entirely created by mas large enough to have a center of gravity that you are pulled towards we have created artificial gravity so in space here is a down but the down is a lie! The more accurate down would be finding the next closest star or moon or large planet in order to exert enough gravitons on us How do you know that this is a lie? Because it's artificial We could change it at any time (Deep drone of night time) hey norm? What? Do you ever wonder why we became scientists No.. go to sleep Well... i don't, I don't know why i don't I just don't Interesting Rusty, go to sleep I can't, i keep thinking about stuff try counting sheep oh what kind? Uhhh pick your favorite When i was young, i tried to breed multicolored sheep to make argile socks Then count your fingers Hey Norm mmmhmmm when peter touched my gieger counter it beeped he is slightly radioactive he's radioactive? Mmhmmm i asked him about it he said he wexposed himself to radioactivity to get out of the draft shrewed maybe we should have tried that yeah maybe i wonder what the long term health effects are I'm surprised it hasn't deminished yet I'm guessing he did it a while ago maybe maybe there is something else going on maybe Maybe he is actualy a robot and internaly he has like a nuclear reactor in order to power him and that's why he is actualy radioactive and he was just lying to me I am glad that's settled huh... Don't ask me, where i got these but i was able to find you a top some nice pants and a lovely leather jacket thank you very much Peter. Hey Norm What? Hey Norm? What? I'm glad you are a scientist with me I'm glad you're a scientist with me too but not right now because i need some sleep (jazzy upbeat lounge music!) Say the sun comes up is because when... what they see, is the earth going around the star now we, are not on said planet we are in the fork or the spaceship if you will Yeah Wish i had a golf ball How did you? Wow uh... thanks... Uh... any chance you can cut the next one diagonaly AHA! I have you now captain freedom! You will never take me alive you imperial dog! AHA, but your phasor cannon is all out of ammunition, and my twin crossbows of death, have you in there sights thats ok but i have air support (SCAW) NO! Curse you captain freedom, CURSE YOU!!!! Doc we need you! I'm watching Wrestletopia. Its joe Mohawk vrs Larry the Wearwolf the sun, has nothing to do with it, it all depends upon our position no No No No No... no... yes... yes... yes... no no (song ends) It does not matter what you say there is no sun up in space because we are not on a planet where the sun can come up over the horizen line in the distance are you suggesting the sun actualy comes up over horizen line when you are on a planet? I am suggesting that the phrase lends itself to the notion that it appears to rise and to set yeah, and at sun up is when you rise then why do they call it sun up, and not you up because you have such a shining personality you were the one who said there was down in space, how can you say the sun comes up when you dont even think there is a down check mate im going to stab you with this fork do it i dare you UHHHHHHH Ok.... Week two Everybody alright? anything new? Yeah, the eggs have turned Thats impossile, they were powdered and canned they should last more then a century We didn't pack any canned bagged eggs Jesus, these things have been on here since it was abandoned Ok Lets say this is a planet yeah, ok thats a planet I'm going to be back before they are done and this right here, is the sun ora star Now, if we are on, said planet sun rises, because the earth goes... because the planetary system goes around like this Alright, and now we are not on said planet we are here so you are only suggesting that that the notion of sun up in space is insignificant because the sun Doesn't go up in space and yet when its used on the planet the sunalso doesn't go up there either, so the phrase is felecious to begin with do you think he is acting weird lately? I don't know, im a doctor not a psyciotrist Still bad.... NAT? where did you get those eggs? NAT? (Snapping fingers) NAT Do you Require me sir? Yes, Nat, where did you get those eggs? That you made for us this morning in the back storage. My programing requires that i use the oldest items first as to prevent spoiledge Ah um why don't you show me where that back storrage is later but for now i just want you... when you are cooking just Run food by me, just to make sure it has not spoiled That is untrue sir, I checked the compesition it held a surprising amount of nutrients including high amounts of protien and iron without contaminents or pathegeons ok, i am sure that is true but they kinda.. tasted bad unfortunatly sir i do not have the ability to taste right tell you what next time just run anything by me that is passed its due by date ok? Update Accepted the sun wewouldn't really know the sun as like.... the sun, because we are not on earth we have never been on earth all the suns are actualy stars actualy stars ok alright..
