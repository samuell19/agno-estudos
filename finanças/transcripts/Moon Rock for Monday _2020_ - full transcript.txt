Hey, Monday! Come and take your pill. I'm coming. Monday. You know what day of the week it is? I know. But we'll get a couple of those milkshakes you love from Mick after, OK? So eat your breakfast and get ready for class. Machu Picchu was built by the Incas in the 1450s. They were conquered by the Spanish in the 1500s. If you have a question, just ask. Did the Incas have a Moon Rock like the Aboriginals? You know it's not called that. What's its real name? - Uluru. - Good. It's in the middle of Australia, in the Northern Territory. Point to it on the globe for me. Well done. So the Spanish carried diseases like smallpox which the Incas weren't immune to. It eventually allowed the Spanish to conquer them and subsequently destroyed much of the Incas' culture. Hey, little one. What you doing with Rabbit? I'm just going to say goodbye before you bury him. Oh. I tell you what. Let's stop by the pet shop on the way to the hospital and get you another one. I just want Rabbit. I know. But things get replaced, Monday. Then... why didn't you replace Mum? Well... That's... That's different. Right, Monday. Stand there. It's the same as my mum's, I swear to God. Can we go now? Tyler! Five fives. 25. Six nines. 54. I saw you use your fingers, you cheeky little monkey. Don't have a name for him yet. What do you wanna call him? What do you think? Hmm. Rabbit Two? Rabby? You're not very inventive! - Who came up with my name? - I did. How? You were born on a Monday. So can you tell me what you learned this week? Don't feed rabbits avocado. What about something from school? The Moon Rock. Do you know you can see it from space? I have always wanted to go there. You know what? If your dad won't take you, then I will. If you go there, it can heal your sickness. Where did you hear that? That's good. How are the new pills? Better. Come here, honey. Let's go, little one. - 'Bye, Nurse Roz. - 'Bye! Ooh! Little one, are you OK? You alright? Ah, look. Give me that. See? Laces undone. Can we go on an excursion? Sure. Where would you wanna go? Anywhere! We could go see Mum. It just makes you sad. Let's go to the Moon Rock. It's Uluru. And it's 3,000km away. It's actually 2,908km away. You know, we've been through this, Monday. It's too far, it's too expensive, and where would we find the time? I don't wanna go home. And you and Mum had time. Let's go. Monday! Come on. Alright, everyone on the ground! You sit over there. - Look after... - Rabbit Two. Fair enough. One chocolate milkshake coming up. - Hey, Mick. How you going? - Bob. - How's things? - Good. - As beautiful as ever. - Here we go. Bit of extra strawberry, maybe. Yeah, yeah. Will do. First stop, Rose hill Racecourse. Doors closing. I'll be right back, Mick. Hang on. Monday! Hey, Monday? Monday! Is this little fella yours? There you go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Can you see him? - Where is he? - He's on the train. OK, radio ahead. - He's a dead man. - Excuse me. My 10-year-old daughter got on the train that just left. Yeah, we'll be with you in a moment. I think she got on there accidentally. Teenage male heading north on train line between Clyde and Carlingford. Wearing a black jacket. Approximately 5'10". Travelling alone. Advise - the suspect is armed. Hello. Hey. Are you alone? You shouldn't go wandering off by yourself. Where are your parents? Looking for your dad? You want some help finding him? It's alright. I've got her. You wanna go with her or you wanna go with me? You wanna go with me? - OK, let's find Dad. - Wait, wait, wait. Will you take my bag for me? - Hang on a second. - It's all good. I've got it. - Fine. - Let's go. Come on. ...Rose hill Racecourse, then... Just be cool. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Can I help you? Confirm - suspect's travelling alone? Are you in trouble? Huh? Confirmed. Offender is travelling alone. Hey, walk a bit faster. Hey. Come here, come here. Sit down, sit down. Here you go. Alright, I'm gonna leave you here. Your dad will come soon, I promise. You know what? We can find your dad later. Wanna go on an adventure? - Like an excursion? - Yeah. Exactly. Like a school excursion. Let's go. Let's go! I don't go to school. Is that right? Huh. Yeah, well, me either. Hey, have you ever been in a race? - Huh? Like a running race. - No. Alright. Me and you are gonna race. - You and I. - Huh? We're gonna run down the street and around the corner. Why don't you show me how fast you can run, OK? I'll give you a head start. Alright. Three, two, one, go. Ohh! Keep it up there. Let's go, boys. Do you play basketball? I've never played sport before. You look like you've got a pretty good throw on you. - Hey, I've gotta pee. - Really? Why don't you go around there? - Are you sure? - Yeah. Go on. Ow! - You all good? - No. There's ants. You'll be right. Just flick 'em away. Come on. Hurry up. OK. Who is this guy? Um, my other rabbit's replacement. Oh, yeah? What happened to your other rabbit? - Dead. - Oh. Rest in peace. What colour was he? Uh, light brown. Oh, yeah? Well... this little fella's white. Even if you painted him brown, it'd still be different. - What's his name? - Rabbit Two. Can you say it again? Rabbit Two. - One more time? - Rabbit Two. Yep. Yeah, that's the worst name I've ever heard. Who... who came up with that name? My dad. Genius, Dad. Well, what do you want me to name him? I don't know. He deserves a better name than that. Something original. Something... Just name him after something you actually like. Like bacon? OK, you weirdo. Bacon it is. Nice to meet you, Mr Bacon. - I'm Tyler. - I'm Monday. - What's your real name? - Monday. There you go. Just remember, be chill. There's no cash. This is Monday. Moose. Hey, Monday. Why don't you go take some photos? You know how this works? Yeah? There's some old trains over there. Tyler, did you fire it? - Did you shoot this? - I don't know. There... There was a cop and he shot at me, so... You shot a cop?! - Is he dead? - I don't... I don't know, man. It was an accident. I wasn't trying to hit him. It doesn't matter now, mate. They're gonna come looking for you. You gotta get outta here. Where am I gonna go? Go. Anywhere but here. Get to the mines. In the Northern Territory. Moon Rock. They'll nail you. You gotta get outta here. What do you know? You can't even buy your own meds. You're just sitting here sniffing spray paint. Yes, I see you! Far out. Hey, you good? Cool. Hey. I know what I'm gonna do. I got a plan. Put your hands over your ears. I'm gonna get a car and I'm gonna jam it across to the Northern Territory. What'll you do about her? Drop her off near a police station. - You serious? - A hospital. No more hospitals. Oh, well, I haven't figured that out yet. I could come with you. We could go to the Moon Rock. What's a moon rock? Uluru. Yeah, I'll think about it. Hey. You know, I'd have more of a chance making it across with her. Once I get out of Sydney, I'll put her on a bus back home. There's no harm done. I'll be fine. I'll gank a car, we'll divvy up the jewelry. We'll leave that rabbit here. I'll send you a postcard. I'm sorry about before. That's alright. Can I wear these? So, why do you wanna go to this Moon Rock so bad? If I get there and heal myself, it'll make my dad happy. Like my jacket? Yeah! Pretty cool. Hey, remember. If anyone looks at you, you don't look at 'em funny or anything like that, OK? - Just play it cool, yeah? - Play it cool. You got it. Tyler, do I look cool? You don't need to worry about that. You start thinking about being cool, you're not gonna be very cool. Hmm. What's your favourite colour? I don't know. No-one's ever asked me that. Red? - What about you? - Rainbow. Rainbow! That's not a colour. That's cheating. No, it's technically colours. Hmm, first I've heard of it. What are you doing? Hey, you know, I'm... I'm sorry about Bacon. But Moose will look after him, I promise. You all good with that? Yeah. Sweet. Hey, stop! Here's my car. Tyler, are we stealing? No, no, These cars are just dumped here. Come on, hop in. Ready for a photo. You hungry? Do you get lunch on excursions? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. We can get some lunch. I just gotta take care of something first. Music? Whoo! Detective. Uh, any news? - And you are? - My daughter was kidnapped. - Oh, the missing girl, yeah. - Her name is Monday. Well, look, we're doing everything we can, OK? Listen, she needs medication or she could die. - What? - She has a blood condition. It's a rare condition. I'm not just after a cop killer here, but... ...unfortunately, the... the victim was my brother. 50m away and I never took my shot. How do you think Rich's family took the news? - You never met him. - So? So don't talk about him like you knew him. You didn't even know he was Lionell's brother. Close the door. But, Sarge, protocol's to take him inside for general processing. Cameras picked him up casing the joint. And Lionell will wanna have a little chat to him. That's the kind of protocol we have round here. Say her name. What? Well, you haven't asked me any questions. And I've been here for hours, and no-one's even asked me for a photo, so say her name. Say my brother's name. My 10-year-old daughter has been kidnapped. - Hey, Lion. - Yeah. I've got the kid from the jewelry store out the back. The one you wanted to see. Yeah, good. Alright, let's sit down. Listen, um... - Bob. - Bob. I believe you've been informed the other passengers on the train said that the girl went willingly. Everything alright at home? Yes. Here's my card. We'll call you as soon as we know anything. - Hey. - What? Are you friends with the kid who robbed the jewelry shop? He took my daughter. I just want her back. I need to know where he is. Please, I just want my daughter. You good to chill here for a bit? I'll be back in a sec. You OK? Mmm! - You kidding me? - No. Alright, give it back. Come on. Don't play with me. Well, how much do you want? - For this? - Yeah. At least... ...2,000. That stuff's hot, mate. Alright, give me 500. - 400. - Come on. 450. Fine. 450. Fifty, three. Fifty, four. 450. Nice doing business with you. Likewise. Was there anything else? Give us a look. I'll give you 500 for this. On top of what I already gave you. - Give it back. - Hey, hey. You can have the two grand. Take it. What you got there? - Monday, what... - Let me keep him, Tyler! - What is wrong with you? - I don't know. Why'd you never go to school? My dad teaches me. Why's that? So I can learn. What, for a job or something? I'll never get a job. Why, are you rich? Huh? No. Well, then why? I'll never live to be older than 16. Why... Why would you say something like that? Well... I have a virus. Yeah? What kind? It attacks my immunity. Im... immunity? Can't the doctors just fix it? They've been trying to my whole life, but... Alright, well... ...you can keep the rabbit. But if I get hungry, I'm gonna eat it. I'll eat you first. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hm. We'll see about that. From now on, if anyone asks, you're my sister, I'm your brother. OK? Got that? The plan is... ...we're gonna go... ...west, down through South Australia. That'll be the fastest way. Monday! Monday, it's your dad, sweetie. Come out! Monday! Monday? Where is she? - Who are you? - I'm looking for Monday. - Monday! - I... I don't know who that is. This is her rabbit cage. Now, if you tell me where she is, I'll walk away and there'll be no trouble. OK? So, where is she? I... I don't... Where is she?! She's gone with Tyler. They've gone to Alice Springs. Alice Springs? How are they getting to Alice Springs? In... in a car. When are they leaving? This afternoon. Don't call the cops, sir. Monday could get hurt. Please! I'm tapping out. - You chew it. - Oh. What do you expect? I've never had gum. Now, now. - Hey, Tyler? - Mmm? When will you give me my medication? Why does everyone I know need meds? Yeah, it helps my immunity. OK, well, I'll buy some from the next pharmacy. What's it called? I don't know. Well, shit! Don't swear! Fine. Cauliflower burrito. What's that? It's a swear word. You take something you hate, like cauliflower, you jam it with something you like, a burrito. The more you hate and love the words, the worse the swear word is. Cauliflower burrito. Hey, Tyler, I wanna call Dad. You wanna go home? No, I just wanna tell him I'm OK. I miss you and I'm sorry I didn't drink the milkshake. I promise I'll be back home after the excursion. It was just the answering machine. That's alright. We can try again later. Detective Lion. You make funny noises when you sleep. Yeah, you do these big farts in your sleep. - No, I don't! - Yeah, you do. - No, I don't. - Yeah, you do! They're really stinky too. - You're lying, Tyler. - Yeah, you farted. - What'd you eat? - You're just embarrassed. Alright. You ready to go? NSW Police have announced a nationwide manhunt for a teenage boy on the run after a bungled jewelry heist. The alleged offender... Alright, eyes up. I got one. I spy something beginning with... You're not saying it right, Tyler. Say it right. I spy with my little eye something beginning with D. - D. - D. - D, D. - D, D. Dad. My dad had a good job. I wish I could get a good job. It's hard when you... don't know how to read. Well, he gave it up to look after me. What did he do? He was a really good teacher at universities. What about your mum? She's dead. She died on a Monday. Yeah, well, she's not dead. She's in heaven. Dad doesn't believe in heaven. Well, it's still there. Will you get to go? Oh, probably not. Why? 'Cause there's some rules to life, and I broke 'em. Why did you break them? You remember Moose, my friend, yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah, Moose needs medication. So you did something bad for a good reason. Yeah. But it's more complicated than that. My mum gave me her ring. It was the best thing I'd ever seen. It still is. Anyway, it got taken from me. But I found it. Can I see it? Are your hands clean? They are now. It's red! Like the Moon Rock. - It's a moon stone! - Give it. If you want, my dad can teach you how to read. - Really? - Yeah. You good to wait here? OK. - Can you give us a Jerry can? - Sure. ...kidnapping of a young girl. Police say the suspect is carrying a large amount of cash and jewelry , but warn the public not to approach the offender as he is considered armed and dangerous. If you have any information, please call Crime Stoppers on 1800... Hey, sweetie, where are you guys off to? We're on an excursion. Oh, yeah? - No petrol? - Nah. Just that. You're the kids on the news with the jewelry, right? I don't have jewelry, but my brother has a moon ring. - How much? - 8.50. Oh, yeah? He does, does he? Has he got it on him? Uh... He... I don't know. Do you think he'll show me? Keep the change. - You all good, bro? - Yeah. - We're just havin' a chat. - Yeah? - Asking directions, are ya? - Yeah. Something like that. Are you ready to roll, piglet? I spy with my little eye... I'm not playing. Didn't your dad teach you not to talk to strangers? Huh? Well, you're a stranger and now we're friends. Yeah, well, that's different. You can't just go around talkin' to everyone. Not everyone's out to be your friend. You need to keep your mouth shut sometimes. Now, look, I don't want people messing with you. Need to work on that angry face. Show people you can get mad. Like a lion? Yeah. Like a lion. I wanna hear you roar like a lion. What's that? What are you, a cat? That's pathetic. It's more like a meow. Come on, give me a roar. A proper roar. Louder, longer. Roar. Roar! Come on, roar! There you go! There you go. One more time. Whoo! Now you're scary. You enjoying that chocolate? It's better than the gum. Hey, um, I don't think I can get you this medication. Oh. Dad says it's really important. Did he? Hey, 'shmile'. Alright, give me a sec. You wait here, yeah? Uh, one ticket to Sydney, please. Hey, Monday, I've, uh... I've got you a bus ticket. Where we going? You're going home. - Tyler, you promised. - Hey. I know I promised. But I can't get your medication. - So you gotta go. - Bet you didn't even try. Monday. Monday! Slow down. Let me talk to you. Come on. Come here. Here you go. Hey. It's gonna be OK, Monday. Rumplefish marmalade. What's that? - My angry word. - Oh, yeah? What's a rumplefish? I don't know. I just don't like 'em. Hey. Come on, get up, get up. We gotta go. We gotta go. That's the nice truck driver from before. It's all good. I got him. I got him. Here we go. Shh. Shh, shh, shh. Shh. Hands over your ears. Hands over your ears. Shh, shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Hey! Ahh! I know you're the kid from the news! Shh, shh. Hey, hey. It's going to be OK. Give us the stuff you stole! I promise. Shh. Open the door! Ahh! Tyler! - Get off me! - Ugh! Ahh! No! Cauliflower burrito! - Where's the rest?! - You got it. You got it all. Cauliflower burrito! Ugh. Are you OK? Hey, I'm alright. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just get us to the Moon Rock. I hate feeling sick. Hey, that was pretty gnarly before. You totally freaked that guy out. - Tyler. - Hmm? How do you know if you can trust someone? Well, you can't. Not for certain. But that's, uh... that's life. Well, I trust you. Hey, I spy with my little eye something beginning with C. Clouds. Mmm. We need a new game. I'm gonna get you those pills. Nah, it's OK. I don't like them anyway. Can I have some more gum? You really like it, don't you? They're small. Are you swallowing them? Monday! You fool, you chew it. Alright, down you get, you weirdo. Yep. Oh! What was that?! What the hell? Hey, sorry, brother! Hey! Two minutes. G'day. Yeah. Sorry about the, uh... the dent. But... ...let's focus on the positives, yeah? - Positives? - Yeah. One, no-one was hurt. Two, I'll pay for the damages. And three, I am about to make my speciality. Sausages. Oh. Hello. And you're both invited for lunch. She's a quick one, yeah. After you, my friend. Beautiful. Lovely car. So, uh, big fella, who are you? - No-one. - Alright. Right. - Where you heading? - Nowhere. No-one heading nowhere. See, now, you must be hiding from something. Yeah, I could ask you the same question. So ask. Who are you? Johnny. Oh, God. Mate, that's a weak handshake. You can tell a lot about a person's character by their handshake. And that? That needs some working on, hmm? Who are you hiding from, Johnny? Oh. The world. Mate, sometimes it goes crazy. All you can do is hide or run from it, so... Yeah. What's her story? Yes. You, little girl with the big eyes. Hmm? I'm Monday. I'm travelling with Bacon. - He's my replacement rabbit. - Uh-huh. I'm driving with Tyler to the Moon Rock. - I thought I was crazy. Mmm. - Mmm. Does, um, this fella look a bit tired to you? - Yeah. He has nightmares. - Oh. - No, I don't. - Yeah, I hear you, Tyler. I don't have nightmares. Oh, that's beautiful. Look at that. See? Look, you can't shake a hand too hard, otherwise they'll think you've got something to prove, OK? But then if it's too weak, you can't trust 'em. Trust me. Yeah? There we go. - That is good. - My man! So, uh, what's with this Moon Rock mumbo jumbo? It can heal you if you're sick. Oh! And it can also heal Tyler as well. Yes, the big fella. Yes. Yes. Yes. He told me about your medicine. In my opinion, I think white medicine will make you better or sicker. Think of it like a, um... Oh, a flower. It's beautiful. But only because it blooms for such a short time. There. You'll be fine, little one. You'll be fine. Goodbye, little Monday! See you, Johnny! Ow! Where you headin'? Uh, Alice Springs. Oh, I'm not going that far, man. But I can take you north 1,000 clicks, bro. Thank you. That'd be great. Dude, I'm a little baked, man. Do you wanna drive? Yeah. Yeah, I can drive. Hey. I'm gonna take a nap in the back. Hey, you want a smokie? I don't smokie. Thanks. Hey, I don't think I've got enough cash to get you a doctor and the medicine. - That's good. - No, it's not. It's bad. I don't want to take the medication anymore. Well, you gotta. What? What the... What's going on? It's busted. - Rumplefish marmalade. - Yep. Rumplefish marmalade. Hmm. Can we hitchhike? And who's gonna pick us up around here? You guys alright? Wait. Want some gum? Thanks. - Just don't swallow it. - Yeah. You, uh, want a beer? - Yeah. - A bit warm. It's all good. So, Alice Springs, eh? - Yep. - What for? Well, it can't be a holiday 'cause you haven't got any bags. Yeah, I'm, um... I'm looking for work at the mines. You'll have to go further north, mate. But there's a bus station in Alice Springs. Somebody will take you north. What will you do with your sister? Just put her on a bus back to Sydney. By herself? Why are you asking so many questions? Oh, sorry. Mind my own business. Pass us the ciggies, mate. They're in the glove compartment. Cheers. Hey. Is it just me or does Mark kinda look like a potato? You're drunk. - No, I'm not. - I can tell. Don't start with me, Maddie. Alright, Monday? The girls get the tent, the guys get the car. Well, 'night! You keep the back. I'll take the front. Mum! My ciggies. - Hey! What are you doin'? - Where are they? My ciggies. You stole 'em! - Get off me, you creep! - Arrgh! - Monday! - What's going on? Get up. We're going. Get up! - The bastard attacked me! - What? Tyler? Monday, come here. Stay down! Dad! Hey, Monday, we're leaving right now. - I'm staying. - What? I said I'm staying, Tyler. Come on, let's go. You were never gonna take me to Moon Rock. You were just gonna leave me here! I heard you, Tyler. You're a liar, liar! OK, you can call me that later. Right now we're going. I want Dad! I hate you! - You're not taking my car, mate. - Yeah, what are you gonna do? Hey, Monday, I'm sorry. Do you hear me? Monday, I'm... I'm sorry. You left Bacon behind! Uh... Yeah, I'm gonna get you another one. No! You're just gonna leave me. Then you're gonna replace me like everyone else. Hey, I'm gonna get you to the Moon Rock, OK? I promise. OK? I promise. Oh, no! Shit. Quick, man, open the glove compartment. Why? What are you doing? Hey, don't look at me. To the counter. - There's no cash on premises. - I'm not after cash. - We haven't even opened yet. - Shut up. I need drugs for something that attacks your immunity. - Come on, help me out here. - Is it for HIV? No. No, the doctors don't know what it is. It attacks the immunity. You'll probably need something that prevents infections. Yeah. Just get everything you think. Alright? Anything. You're the expert, right? - Alright. Everything's out back. - OK. Go on. - OK. - Hurry up. Please. This is everything. This helps with infection. This is new. This helps prevent the growth of the virus. Everything else in here is for immunity. OK? Do you understand this medication can have negative side effects? How much? If you had to guess. Um... the fusion inhibitors are worth about $800 alone. Wow. That's a lot of money. Yeah. Yeah, that's crazy. Um, well, I've got, like, 40 bucks. What is wrong with you? You need it more. OK? Keep it. Hey, um, I know this is a bit random. But, uh, if somehow we saw each other again, would you ever, like, wanna... Get out of here, you muppet. I think of funny things while I'm driving. Like, right now, I feel like this car is a time machine. Right, you look forward, you look ahead. That's the future. You look up in the rear-view mirror at what's behind you, that's the past. But I never feel like I'm... I'm in between. You know? Like, just... just here. That's the present. That's where you gotta be. But it's hard, you know? It's hard to forget stuff. Feel like I've been looking out the back window my whole life. I'm not giving it to you. It's just a loan till we get to your Moon Rock. It's kinda like proof that I'm not gonna leave you. Any of these look familiar? You sure? Two a day. One in the morning and one at night. Gimme your hand. Do I have to take it? I feel so good. Yeah, I think you should. Good girl. Makin' up for lost time now, baby! - Where we heading? - The Moon Rock. - What's that? I can't hear. - The Moon Rock! - What's that again? - Moon Rock! Moon Rock, baby! Oh! Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Uh-oh. Stop pretending like you know what you're doing, Tyler. Probably just out of petrol. - Huh. - Huh. Told you so. Alright, so what do we do? What do you think? Well, it's definitely longer than 10km back, and I've got no idea how much further it is till the next town. Um, past, future. Present. Come on, push it. Well... Waffle piss! Waffle piss. - Say it. Come on. Waffle piss. - Waffle piss! - What's piss? - Piss. Hey, how about this one? You ready? Oyster hammerhead! Oyster hammerhead! I'm thirsty! Stop screaming! Tyler, are we lost? We're not lost. We're gonna be there soon, I promise. - I think. - You think? - I've got a good feeling. - Hmm. OK. Is it much longer? I don't think so. You said that before. No, I didn't. You must be hearing things. Tyler, I'm scared. - Well, where are we? - Nowhere near the Moon Rock. No, I mean, if we're in the present, right now, right here, we're exactly where we need to be. Yes, please. Hey! Hurry up. Excuse me! Hello! What are you two doing out here? Trying to find the present. What present? Nothing, nothing. We're looking to get to Coober Pedy. Jump in. I'm Elvis. - The real one? - No. Well, I'm Monday. - Like the real day? - Exactly! - Jump in. - Thanks. So, why ice cream? Why not? Coober Pedy is the hottest city in the world. Ice cream makes everything better. Makes everything better! Hey, uh, can I get two tickets to Uluru, please? Nah. Buses don't go there. - Alice Springs? - No. Buses don't go anywhere from here except back the way you came. Uh, OK, fine. I'll just get two tickets back, then. - When's it leave? - Tomorrow. 50 bucks. I'm... I'm a little short. Do you reckon you could, like, help me out? Yeah, nah. Not my problem. Heh. - Thanks for your help. - Yeah. Uh, yeah, operator, I need to find a number in Sydney. Lion. When we were kids, we used to go rabbiting up the end of the street, Rich and I. Uh, I'd always dig the hole and pull 'em out and he'd do the job on 'em. And the old man must have found out. One night he fronted me. He said, uh... he said how come you won't kill the rabbits? I said, "I don't know. I just don't like doing it. "Rich likes it, so..." He give me a clip behind the ears. He said, "You bloody well will next time." But I never did. Oh, Rich... I kept digging them out and he kept breaking their necks. I got a call. Kid's been spotted in Coober Pedy. Thanks, brother. Yep. Hello. What you cooking? Moon-shaped pancake. Wow. Are you a real-life astronaut? - How did you know? - I could tell from your costume. Oh. Of course you could. That's 'cause you're smarter than all the rest. I'm The Bobbins. I'm Monday. And we're going to the Moon Rock. Moon Rock, eh? Well, little lady, I'm sure you can appreciate this. But I can do you one better. I can take you to the moon. - Can we, Tyler? - It's a scam, Monday. - It's not. - Is too. It is not. Look, spaceman, we just want to get out of here. Where you heading? North. I can take you... for a price. Well, I've got, like, 20 bucks. Done. - Plus a pancake? - Yeah. But first I'm gonna show you the moon. This rabbit look familiar to you? I thought it might have been your kid's. We picked up a father and daughter who had it. Said they were travelling with a girl called Monday. They've been spotted in Coober Pedy. You can walk around it, but it would take quite a while. I bet you didn't know that, Mr The Bobbins. - Just Bobbins is fine. - Oh. You probably already know this, but you can see the Moon Rock from space. Hey, Monday, time to take your pills. Wow. This is amazing. Yeah. When you're done, if you head back on foot along the road, you'll be back in Coober in about an hour. If you get cold, there's some firewood over there. It's my private stash. Hey, kid. Can you chuck us the money now, so I can get some supplies? I'll give it to you when we get back to town. Oh, matey! Thanks, Mr The Bobbins. Humph. See you, Miss Monday. Keep on dreaming. Well, here we are. We're on the moon! Yeah. Yep. - I can do that. - Go on. There! We should probably get going. It's getting late. Can we stay? - Where are you gonna sleep? - On the ground. Yeah, yeah. Right. Please, Tyler. I really want to stay the night. Oh, really? You want to sleep here? Yeah, 'cause I want to see the stars, and I never really get to see them again. OK. Alright. Calm down. Where are you going? I'm gonna build a fire. It's OK if you don't get us to the Moon Rock. Hey. We're on the moon, yeah? Well, then, technically these are moon rocks. Wow. - I never thought of that. - Yeah. I never got you there. Yes, you did. What are you doing? Star jumps. You're a weird-looking star. There you go. Gonna get ya! - Whee! - Whoo! Ready? Kangaroo. What's up? You were snoring. Yeah? You didn't have any nightmares. I do feel pretty good. See? The moon can heal people. Alright, let's go. - What are you doing? - Taking them. No, you're not. Come on, put 'em down. Please, Tyler. Alright, you can take one. Let's go. - Dad! - Monday! Dad! Oh, sweetheart! Oh! Oh, God, I missed you. Are you OK? Did he hurt you? No, he looked after me. Monday, he took you. No, I wanted to go with him. Tyler! Hands in the air! Mum? Hands in the air! He's got something in his hand. Drop it! Tyler! Tyler! Coober Police. A great result, wouldn't you say? The boy had given up. Listen, Bob, if we hadn't gotten him, he'd be sending ransom demands. You are very lucky to have your daughter back. You get Monday home. When we're all back and safe, we'll get you to come in and fill out some forms. What forms? Standard papers, just clearing my officers of any negligence. Give it. Let me hold it. You're gonna lose it. No. Dad... ...I'm not taking them anymore. Monday... I want to be happy. How about you get ready for bed and I'll come and tuck you in? Uh, yeah. Hi, Bob. You don't know me, but my name's Tyler. Dad... Yes, beautiful. Promise me something. Of course. That you won't replace me when I'm gone. Oh, sweetheart. I could never replace you. You are irreplaceable, little girl. Can you stay here till I fall asleep? Yes. Uh. Hi, Bob. You don't know me, but my name's Tyler. Um, I'm calling you just to tell you that I have Monday, she's safe. We're here in, uh, Coober Pedy and I'm... I'm so sorry. I'm... and I'm gonna take her to the Moon Rock. I don't know, you could maybe meet her there. Then I'm gonna turn myself in. We're pretty close, you know? We're fond of each other. Maybe she could visit me in jail. I can't even think about what I've done. Um, I'm so scared. We've got a big day today. How would you like to go to school? - Really? - Yes. Got a couple of places to visit first. You can meet my old boss from the university. Then a surprise. - An excursion? - Yes, exactly. Yeah. Oh, Bob. Good. Detective. We've, uh, prepared a statement. All we need is your signature. I've prepared my own. Monday, let's go. 'Bye, Monday. - Take care of Bacon for me. - I will. Can you please put this on, Mr Driver? Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen... So, where do you think we should go after the Pyramids? I think it's your choice, beautiful.
