Sometimes I feel as though I were from another planet. There are 7 billion people in the world. 1,719,000 of them live in Vienna. I am one of 226,483 school-age children in the city. My name is Mika. I am 10 years 3 months 8 days and 9 hours old. People say I'm different. But isn't everyone different from everyone else? Surely it doesn't matter if a few people are a bit more different... Does it? Shoot! Shoot! Go on, shoot! Shoot! What are you doing? What are you doing? Fetch the ball! Fetch the ball right now! We have to talk. - Nobody wants to talk to you! It's important to talk. Violence just makes things worse. Leave him alone. Piss off, kid. You wouldn't hit a little girl, would you? No, no... Can't you speak English? Of course I can! I live here too. I know. We could be friends. Soon I'm going back to India. My father is a Maharaja. You aren't a princess. OK, I'll tell you the truth. I ran away from home, because my father, the Maharaja, wants me to marry a rich prince. But my heart belongs to another. You're lying. Well, everyone lies sometimes. - I never lie. My mother says because of my upbringing. But the truth is I can't lie. I hate lies! My granny. Did he hurt himself? No, no, he just got a bit dirty. I washed his pants right away... Oh Hedi, thanks: you're an angel! All right, all right. Hallo funny guy! I'm home again. Come in Mars, your Mum's back. Hallo? So I'm just fresh air to you. Watch out you don't breathe me in. You're not air! I don't like you talking like that. So what happened today? Somebody pushed me. If anyone pushes you around, you have to talk to him. Did you forget? Why don't I have any friends? Well, it's just a bit hard for other kids to understand... why you won't let anyone close. When somebody talks to you, you don't even look at him. Shall we invite a boy from your class to come at the weekend? They spoil everything. Right... I spy with my little eye... something that is... black. You can't. Why can't I? - Black isn't a colour. You only get black where there's no light at all... and that's in outer space. OK, you lose. It's the toaster. No. Yes. No. - Yes. Mika, it's the toaster. It's 19.17. No, it's the toaster. I mean the time! I know. It's 19.18! It's much too late! It's all right Mika, all right. Just a minute. Eat, before it gets mixed up. Too late! It's too late! I'll buy you shoes with Velcro fasteners. It makes my ears itch. And you make my nerves itch. Nobody can make nerves itch. Oh, you can. There you are. Hedi will make you pancakes today, OK? - I know. Today is Friday. Exactly. Have a lovely day, my little nerve-itcher! What are you looking at? There was a horse in the night. Rubbish! Maybe it was a big dog. A St Bernard or something. There was a horse. Oh yes, you can't lie. Maybe you dreamt it. I know what's a dream and what's real! Am I pretty? Yes. You really can't lie! Come on! We'll look at the horse. Are you coming? You first. I can't. Coward. At least hold the ladder! There really is a horse! That horse is totally cool! There's nobody there: you go inside, and I'll open the door. Come on! Do come in, Monsieur. Mika! Somebody's coming! Somebody's coming! How did you get in here?! Oh, so you're interested in my horse? You know what? It would be best if you don't tell anybody about it. Good day! Michael Landau! How are you? I'm very well! You live around here, don't you? I have Asperger's Syndrome, so I very often get upset. I can get angry real fast. You threatening me? That was a joke. I hate jokes! I don't understand jokes. I've just moved in... Well horse, are you hungry? He's very soft... and warm. Ask if we can ride him. Right. This is wholemeal pasta. It's all I have. Where are you going? Hello. You love horses? Well? Don't I get an answer? You love horses isn't a question. Have you been to America? - That's a question. Have you been to America? - No. There weren't any horses in America. The Spanish introduced them. Really? Is that a fact? Do you have a son? No. - Aren't you married? I was married once... What's your favourite food? I eat everything. Do you eat snails? Not necessarily. - Neither do I. Although they're very soft. There aren't any apples left. What is it? The horse ate my apple. Cool. I have to go to school. It's really late. So now it doesn't matter anyway. Don't you go to school? Soon I'm going to a private school. My father, the Maharaja, is buying me... What's Asperger's Syndrome? A mild form of autism. What's autism? I have problems with people. Like what? I don't look at people when I talk to them. That's not so bad. - I get claustrophobia. Lots of people do. I have to have lunch at exactly 14.17 and dinner at exactly 19.17. Otherwise I lose my temper. I'd like to see you lose your temper! I hate jokes. I don't understand them, I can't make them. There are worse things. I hate it when people touch me. - So do I; I'm not a dog. I love mathematics! OK, you're nuts! Be quick but quiet. Come on! Come on, that's right, come with me. Why are you hurting him? - What can I do? He keeps fighting! Then you won't get any food, miserable creature! People have to eat regularly. And so do horses, of course. Come on! Now what's the matter? Hey, could you please help me? I must get to the racecourse, and the horse won't come. Will he get something to eat there? - Sure. Will I be back at two o'clock? - Yes! Have a go. How do you do that? What's going on? Just stay there, will you?! You going to run us over or what? I'm in a hurry! - What can I do? Stop hooting back there! Can't you stop? We'll be gone a minute! I can't just disappear! I can't help this, sorry! What is it? - Get out of here! Well... Right, here we are. Stand still! My God, isn't that Buci? My binoculars...! Yes, it's him! What a fine chap! Good day! Michael Landau! How are you? I'm very well! Good day! Michael Landau! How are you? I'm very well! My name's Branko. Would you like a look? Hey, do you know that horse? - Yes, of course. That's Bucephalus. Named after the famous stallion of Alexander the Great. The history books say they were best friends. Let me show you something. Let me show you something. That's Bucephalus's father, the famous Baltazzi! His mother was famous, too, but I don't have any pictures of her. There! That was his first Derby win. We trained him from when he was just a foal. Just a minute... And this was his jockey's helmet. You can keep it. It's a present. Now you've got a racehorse, you need a proper helmet. And this was his bridle. Thanks. Now... my treasure... Where can I put his name down for a race? How long have you had Buci? I won him in a raffle yesterday. - And they didn't tell you? Tell me what? Hold on to this. He injured himself in a race. A torn tendon. But he just overtook the other horse! Yes - without a jockey. Heel... No, he'll never be able to run another race. But he's recovered well. Your son could ride him. Hold on tight. Squeeze your knees together. Now we'll go for a little walk. Watch out. Would you like him? For a very reasonable price. Won him in a raffle... Buci doesn't deserve that. It's two o'clock! I must be back in 17 minutes. Coming. We'll never make it! - Name your price! Lunch is at 14.17. How can I look after him? Come on, Christopher. Hedi's making pancakes. Today's Friday. I must be home by 14.17! - No charge! You can have him. I get pancakes in 16 minutes. I have to go home. Lunch is at 14.17. - Calm down; we'll take a taxi! With the horse? If you're hungry, eat your sausage! - I can't eat that! I want pancakes! Today's Friday. Not scratchy bread with sausage and hot mustard. Pancakes! Friday. I want pancakes! There aren't any pancakes! Noooooo! Do you want any more pancakes? Shall I make you another? - No thank you. Excuse me. Are they looking for another horse for the carousel? No, it's closed in winter. I must get rid of the horse somehow. Well, I know a horse butcher. Maybe he'll buy it from you for meat. He slaughters them himself. Second road on the left, then right at the lights. His name's Walisch. Thanks. I'll just finish my game. You go! Look, that's a lovely number. 85877. Do you know what a figure total is? The figure total of 85877 is 35. And the figure total of 35 is 8. 8 divided by 2 is 4. And 4 divided by 2 is 2. Hello Mika, I've been looking for you. Hello. I'm talking to you. I'll give you three guesses who I can see. Our professor with the horse. Standing there, yes... A donkey with long legs. Why did you run off? You wanted to turn Bucephalus into sausages. But I'd never do that. You're a bad person. I'm not a bad person. I just can't afford a horse. Come on. Your parents must be worried. My father is dead. I'm sorry. You don't have to be sorry. Swear you won't take Bucephalus to be slaughtered. I swear. I swear by all that's holy. What's holy to you? I don't know - come on! Friendship is holy to me, OK? Everything is going to be fine. Don't worry. Look. You're hopeless! Where have you been? Where did you take him? What have you done with the child? You terrible person you! We just went to the racetrack. - And what else? I had pancakes. Today's Friday. Well, at least you have a hat. If I ever catch you near my son again I'll call the police! Can I ride him, too? Horses aren't considered pets, or small animals, either! Dispose of the horse at once, or I'll report you to the police. All right. Come on. It's best for us both this way. Really. I... I can't give you what you need. A racehorse doesn't belong in an apartment block. All the best. What? Now you're following me? Hello my friend. Cracked the jackpot yet? It's an honour, Professor! But I still have time. Tell me something: How can someone with debts like yours afford a horse? You'll get the money, Toni, don't worry. I'm more worried about your health than my money. You want a horse? I have a racehorse. We can go and look; it's not far. - You got a screw loose? You owe me €3000. And you know I'm very keen on punctuality. Bucephalus! Are you crazy? Go away! What are you doing? Get lost! Go away! Oh, come on! What, again? Would you please leave my things alone? What are you doing? You can't come in here! I'll end up behind bars! Would you like him? - Yes! So ask Father Christmas. - I hate Christmas. But you like presents, right? - I hate surprises. Well, it wouldn't be a surprise. True. What's that? That's my hobby. Mathematics and games. Any idea what that is? - That's a Sudoku. You've got a nerve! Let me show you something. This is a Sudoku puzzle, the hardest sort. Mika solved it in a few seconds. Your son is a genius. Yes - a genius who can't fasten his own shoelaces. He's not the only one. I know; I'm a mathematician. You really have a horse at home? It's just temporary, honest. Cool. Mika wants a horse for Christmas. - Yes, a horse is just what we need! They use horses to treat children with Asperger's syndrome. You could have mine really cheap. €3000. That's nothing for a racehorse. Horses for autistic therapy are much more expensive. If anyone needs therapy around here it's not my son. They're going to kill Bucephalus! Any idea where they're going? - Yes! How can we catch up? In a taxi! You got any money? - Yes! Well, kids, where to? Konstantingasse 1. OK. How much do you have? - What? Money! €2.54. That's not enough. We'd better get out now. We can't. We have to rescue Bucephalus! No, I'm not Turkish, but I can speak Turkish. This is the wrong way! Back to the main street and left after 200 metres. This is the wrong way! I've been driving taxis for 12 years! That doesn't mean it's the right way! Dana, tell him to turn round. This is wrong! Noooooo! I must phone Mum! Where's my phone? I paid the taxi-driver with it. It was no good anyway: completely uncool. Give me your phone! - I don't have any credits left. They'll kill Bucephalus because of you! You think taxis are free? Watch out! Thank you again. I think he just needs some rest. I think so, too. Goodbye. - Evening. Thanks... - Bye. It wasn't my fault; I just went after him. I know. Easy now. Come here. I've made you some cocoa, Mika. Not too hot and not too cold. So what happened? They slaughtered Bucephalus! Sascha lied! Although he gave his word. I hate him! I hate all people! Do animals have graves with crosses? I don't think they care. Anyway, maybe he was Jewish, or Muslim. Or he was a Buddhist and he'll be reincarnated. The question is, what as? A stone. So nobody can eat him. What kind of person are you?! You've broken Mika's heart, you... What? Stop! What happened? What did I do? - How can you ask? The horse Mika loved; you had him butchered! Butchered? Don't act innocent! We saw the horse-butcher take the horse away. That was the cheapest way of transporting him. I can't keep him here. - So you had him slaughtered! I wouldn't have a racehorse slaughtered. He's in the stables. For Mika. Can I ride him too? Just go back inside. The door was open... You don't even have an armchair. What can we take? Tony, I was going to call you. I have good news! My horse has really famous parents. Which is important for a racehorse. Look, that's his pedigree. An ideal breeding stallion, it says. Now you want to breed horses? Not me. But the owners of racing stables will rent him. And I get money for it. Each time... about €1000. A few more days, and instead of €3000 you'll get €4000! Maybe the professor's right. I mean, about breeding horses. There's a lot of money in it. €5000. All right, €5000. Bucephalus is alive! - He's alive?! Yes, he's in the stables. You can have my phone. Until I get you a new one. - I don't want a new phone. But you can get the Internet on mine. - I hate new things! We'll talk about it in the morning. I'll leave this one here. Good night. Sweet dreams. I've never seen Mika so relaxed before. He's so different when he's on the horse. It's amazing how much trust he has in Bucephalus. We can work well like this. The main thing is he's happy. By the way, the vet was here. Very good. - Is the horse sick? No, but for breeding, the vet has to confirm he's healthy. Yes, and fertile! Because if the mare doesn't get pregnant... Can we talk about the financial aspect... Don't worry about that. I can't sleep without my blanket, either. "My blanket is the starry sky..." Is that a song? - Yes, I just made it up. Good night, Bucephalus. Hurry up children, or we'll miss the bus. Yes, Toni, I'm here... So now what? OK, you pay the trainer. But there's no charge for Mika riding the horse. Thanks, Sascha. Come on, fill it right up. Yes, that's right. Bitter. What's that there? Hey, super! Two mulled wines. "And Franz does have one friend. He protects Franz. Franz needs that sometimes, because he's the smallest and weakest boy in the class, and he can't defend himself very well against mean children." I never know if you're listening... But that doesn't matter; I like reading to you. Don't you want any food? It's scratchy. I'd cut my throat. You can't cut your throat with cornflakes. Yes you can. Really? Show me... No. Can we go and see Bucephalus? Hey, don't you ever sleep? We could get the bus at 10:20. If you hurry up. Listen, we'll take a later bus. 2. That was just luck. Hello? Oh, good morning. What? Are you sure? Thanks - goodbye. - 27. Listen... The vet just phoned. Bucephalus can't have children... He can't sire foals. That doesn't matter; he's got me. Look, you have to understand. If he can't get mares pregnant, I won't get any money. And then I can't keep him. 15. How you doing that? I can see the numbers that are coming. But that's fantastic. I can make money for you, so you can keep Bucephalus. You mean in a casino. But kids can't go into casinos. If you go in with a video camera... I can't go in any casino. I'm banned. And I don't know anybody I could trust. I do. It's ages since I was in a casino! The main thing is not to lose your nerve. My nerves are made of steel. Here's the camera. That's the front. Here he comes. My dear Boris! Now don't say: "Oh my God, how long has it been...?" For me it feels like yesterday. You're unique, like you always have been! Merci, cher Monsieur. And you're still an old charmer! With the emphasis on "old". Thank you. No, no, that wasn't in Swan Lake. It was Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet... Yes, of course. Max turned in a tour en l'air, Olga lost her balance, tried to straighten up, slipped and pulled over the whole set! I've got reception. That's all I have, except debts. Thank you, my friend. Here we go. Bonjour Madame. Mind if I sit here? He looks like Lanui. Who's Lanui? That was my dog. Place your bets please. Wouldn't you like some nuts? No thanks. More to the left. Yes, that's right. 11. Rien ne va plus. No more bets. Great, Mika. Carry on! How do you do that? 2450 - pour Madame. Place your bets please. 17. Everything on 17? - Yes. Rien ne va plus. No more bets. Great! Well done! 42,750 - pour Madame. Well? The number before... - Come on, quick. We have to stop soon. 34. - 34. Everything on 34? Everything on 34? Put everything on. We can't stay much longer. Isn't that very risky? Rien ne va plus. No more bets. It's all lost. I did my best. No system is foolproof. I said the number before 34. That's 6. Why didn't you say 6? I hate the number 6. I have to go to the toilet. What was that? I lost everything because you don't like the number 6? The jackpot? So you hate the number 6. Would you mind telling me why? 6 is unreliable. If you turn it upside down, it's a 9. 6 is unreliable? A couple of gangsters are probably going to kill me, because you think 6 is unreliable! You know what, you can forget all about that horse! I'm sorry. Forgive me. Maybe we can try again. - No. Never again. You have to see it from my perspective. I'm completely broke. It's the end for me. It's not the end until you're dead. You divide the horse's weight by 100. Then multiply by 2.5, and that gives you the feed weight. A horse must eat that much every day. I don't know if you can hear me... But I like reading to you. Where's Mika? - Inside with her. Can I go in? - Yes Thanks. This is all my fault. - Well, that makes a change. Gambling ruined my life, but I'm giving up for good. I'm not interested. Please, Lara, believe me... - Yes, yes, yes... Everyone can change... Are you looking forward to the snow? You can already smell it. My dinner. Mika, come here. There's something I must tell you. Your father isn't dead. He walked out on us when you were three. I'm sorry I lied to you, but... I couldn't tell you when you were so small. Can you forgive me? I promise I'll never lie to you again. Sometimes the truth is also a lie. Will you make me mashed potato now? 137 times 5? 685. 2,536 divided by eight? 317. The square root of 225? - 15. Not bad. And the square root of one? That doesn't exist, and you know it. Hedi's going to get better. Don't worry. I've brought you a few things. I think that must be everything... Your shoes... I'd best put the glasses in here. Here. This is for Mika. So he can go riding. But this is 100,000! - I won the jackpot. I can't take it. I don't have anybody else. Am I supposed to take the money to my grave? And this morning I saw he'd gone. You called the cops? No: I thought you'd sneaked him away. Me? Why would I do that? Because he can't have kids. Here you are. With Hedi's money you can have any horse. Now you can ride whenever you want! Won't you at least look at another horse? Dear Mister God. We haven't actually met yet, but you know me. At least, that's what my teacher says, Mrs Stradal. For Christmas I'd like Bucephalus to come home again, and Hedi to get better. And I don't mind if it's a surprise. Thank you in advance. He'll turn up again, believe me. I know about things like that. My grandmother says everything comes back. That's really true! Now what? I need the damn horse's papers. I can't do anything without them. And how are you going to get up there? You're going. But take your shoes off. My uncle has one of those. That's Bucephalus's blanket! It really is his! Then they've got the horse! Are you coming? I have claustrophobia! Something up? That's a nice number. 85877. I've seen it before! This is impossible. Hello?! Taxi! Wait! Just wait! Noooooo! Well, that's all right. Are you nuts?! Kid, I almost ran you over! Are you crazy?! Manhattan Casino, the Prater! Fast! You got money? Oh, great. A phone? Just tell me which way to go, all right? I'm just going to fetch my horse. Yeah, right, and I'll fetch my elephant. Sascha... is Mika with you? Give the nag another sedative. - I'm not going in there. You afraid of it? - I'm not afraid of anything! You're scared! If the animal breaks anything, you pay for it. You drive me out of my mind. I'm not afraid. I'm stronger than... I'm stronger than Superman! I can't do it! There's no need to be afraid any more. I'm with you. I'm coming. Thanks! Untie me fast, before those gorillas get back. Quick! We have to get out of here. We can't leave Bucephalus here by himself. We'll fetch him later. I'm not leaving without Bucephalus. He's not at the sports ground. Maybe he's buying you a Christmas present! Mika hates surprises. Sascha, don't be angry, but I need to be by myself now. They're coming! Wait... Wait... Wait... Just you wait; I'll show you! Wait... And now! Schurli, what is it? We have to talk. - Back into the shed! With the horse. I think we could talk another time. I think so too. I'll call home. Give me my phone. I used it to pay the taxi. "It was no good anyway - completely uncool." Ha, ha - I'll die laughing. That was a joke. Don't you understand? That's what you told me when you paid for the taxi with my phone. You mustn't explain a joke! There you are. What's the idea? Oh, I was so worried. Thank God you're both back! What have you been doing? - We rescued Bucephalus. Where did you find him? We found him in a shed. You're exhausted. I'll get you indoors where it's warm, and then you explain, OK? Can Sascha come too? He's my friend. Yes, of course. But I won't have that horse in my house. Come on. He's with me! The goose! Kids, open the windows! Hedi! Thank you, Mister God. And if there's ever anything I can do for you, just let me know. He's never done that before. So now we can all celebrate Christmas together. Except there's nothing to eat. My granny always has plenty of food. But we can't just turn up... - Yes we can! All of us, really? - Yes! That was my very best Christmas, although there were some surprises, and usually I hate surprises. Sascha and I are friends these days. He has a job now, and no more debts, and the police took away the two thieves. I think I'm going to stay on Earth after all. The people really aren't as stupid as I thought. They've invented lots of great things, such as mathematics... and pancakes. You can't put mathematics and pancakes in one basket! I'm not putting anything in a basket. You see a basket around here? It's just what people say. If you help me with mathematics, I'll show you how to play football. Neither of them are a piece of cake. That's really what people say. It's a deal. I'm coming! I have exactly 2 minutes and 4 seconds left. Dana is in my class now. I have riding lessons every Friday. She helps with the horses, so she can ride too. I still have Asperger's syndrome, though I don't get aggressive so often. But I haven't told anybody that. It's best to keep them a bit scared of me.
