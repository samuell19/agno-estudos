ROSARIO TIJERAS Somebody help me, please! Help me, she's dying! This way, sir. Easy. Easy, calm down. - Stop here. - You're never going to die. Do you understand? Never! Sir, please. Dr. Ventura, go right away to Surgery. Dr. Ventura, go right away to Surgery. Boy. Please, boy. Here. What was the girl's name? - Is. - What is her name? Rosario. Rosario who? Rosario Tijeras. Tijeras. That last name doesn't exist. What's her real last name? - I don't know. - What's her age? I don't know! Give a cigarette, please! Hey! - Emilio, hey! - Can't you see? See you later, honey. - What's up, dude? - I'm fine. And you? Fine. What's going on? Nothing that I like. The ones I like, I've had them. What's more, Sandrita is around. I had her. Why are you against recycling, dude? I'm not. I'm not against recycling... ...but I believe in new things. Brand new is the best for me. - What's up with Maria? - She couldn't make it today. - Neither today? - She didn't call me. That tale again. You don't want to introduce her? So you eat her as well? Dude, come on... You know the golden rule: Not to touch a friend's girl. - That's right. - Cheers. Did you see something you like? No, I haven't seen anyone. All the nice ones are at the VIP's. For that mother fucker, right? - Shall we get high? - I've already gone. You didn't wait for me. I'll be back. Hey! Did you hear me? What about your drink? Emilio, what's up? How's everything? What else? I called you. I know it's late, bro, but... ...I'm here at the hospital with Rosario. She was shot, and she's bad. Right now... ... she's being operated, and... ... I don't know what may happen. I think... ... what happened between us doesn't matter. She matters. I'm telling you. What happens to Rosario is serious. Very serious. Baby, we haven't finished. You're drunk. It's all you can do. Let go of me. - I need to talk to you. - Don't grab me like that! You're so snobby, Rosario! You're so snobby. What's wrong? That's it! What? What's up? I want to know you. That's all. - You want to know me... - What's your name? God... Happy? - Who's that little girl? - My sister, boss. Your sister? - Yes, she's Rosario. My sister. - Aren't there complications? No, no. At all. Tell me, who's Rosario? She's a woman I saw. I don't know if it's worse or better. I don't know her last name, where she lives, nothing. What are you doing with her? You'd better ask her what she's doing to me. I'm crazy for her. I feel she's the woman of my life. You always say the same. I've known more than 30. Dude, this is for real. You'll see her. Dude, she's like a... ...like a Venus. She's like a futuristic Venus. Futuriste Venus? How come? Look, dude. There she is. Are you crazy or what? That woman is theirs. If you touch her, they'll kill you. I touched her all over and I'm alive. The only thing that matters is she's with me now. What do you think? Come, I'll introduce her to you. I'll give you a proof-bullet vest. - Don't be mean. - I'm not mean. You forgot what happened to Pedro? Only because he offered her a drink. Dude, this is Rosario. This is my boy, Antonio. Antonio... ...like my favorite saint. Swallow it. What are you doing here? Have you become a woman? How are you? Emilio! Emilio! Hi. What's up? My parents will throw a party this weekend. I wanted to know if you'd come with me. Shall we? - Shall you? - We'll go. Deal. Can you stay a while with Antonio... ...while I'll go for the drinks? Let's go get Rosario, dude. Hey! Hey! Where you go? Can you tell me why are we leaving? Hop on! Hop on, dude! So stubborn! - Where do we go? - We'll go on a ride. Where to? You have something better to do? Get off. Go on. That's okay with me. This house? - Is it yours? - That doesn't matter. Wait here. How are you? I'm fine, fine. Better. Come on, dude. Let's go. What's your scent? What's my scent? This is my scent. Easy... What do you see? What do you see when you see me? I see someone who does odd things... ...but that doesn't want to do them. You'll never, never understand what I do! Be content with what I do to you. - Good evening. - Good evening, sir. - You came with the girl? - Yes, I came with her. Are you her relative, boyfriend? A friend. Who killed her? She was shot... ...and she's not dead. She's being operated. - Did you see anything? - I saw nothing. Why don't you... ...find who killer her and leave me alone? Well, is she dead or alive? She's alive and will go on alive. Leave me alone. Are you armed? Will you stand up? I.D. Where you live? - In the county. - When you arrived? About... two or three hours ago. Let's go. That boy has nothing to do. Here. What's happened at the disco? Did you shoot? I'm asking because everybody saw you with me. Emilio, you know nothing about me. That's your protection. My protection! Why can't you tell me the truth? Tell me something. Tell me something. You have to. What you and I have... ...is beyond words. If you want to keep it... ...respect my silence. Come here, don't go. Come here, honey. You'll have to finish it alone. - Evening. - Evening. Do me a favor and take a seat. - Can I steal her a minute? - Go on with him. You see than man there? He's Donovan, the American. He asked about you. - Wait. - The American is important. You can safely have a drink with him. - Where, when? - Where and when what? I shoot him. - The man. - You misunderstood. That man is important. He's important to us. He's important to you. He is to your brother. I only ask you to treat him right. You heard me? If you need anything, think it, Rosario. Are you asleep? How will you sleep with the amount... ...of dust you get into yourself? Are you asleep? You don't look fine, girl. You look older than me. The one who shoots well is Jonhefe, my brother. Any place he sees, any place he shoots. That's why he's among the rough ones. He's got along with them, dude. I shouldn't be telling you these things. - Have you seen Emilio? - He's angry at life... ...for you're gone. He will be fine when you tell him I'm here again. So this is your house? Yes, I live here, I do. But none of this is mine. Most things were here when I moved. It's not Rosario's style, is it? I don't know. I don't know well who you are. How are you when you're without me? If you want to go on with our thing... ...respect the rules we set. The rules... I don't think I can. We're fine. I give you all I have. And you give me all you have. What are you doing here? Have you become a woman? Rosario, how can you do this to Ferney? Ferney and I broke up a long time ago. He knows why. - Are you his messenger? - No, no. He told me nothing. Ferneycito told me nothing. I see him suffering a lot. He suffers less without me than with me. Really? What about the rich guy? Is that what worries Ferney? My rich guy. That's not your people. Understand that. That's not your people. Then what's my people, dude? You are? You who turned back when a man harass me? My people? You will go back, but turned into shit. Patuco... ...if you're so worried about Ferney... ...why don't you give him a blow job? I can see you're rough. For your own sake, end of chat. All the woman are like this. All the same. Such bitches! We get a little high, then you leave. Look. Get out! I have my own stuff, child! Understand! I have my own stuff! First lick my face... ...and then kiss me. I don't belong to anyone, not even to my mom. You just won't listen. I'll write it. Res... ...pe... ...ct. Respect! Rosario! - What happened? - Let's go. I'm bored. - Where are we going? - There was a shot. - Let's go. - What happened? Let's go. REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA Couldn't sleep? No, I was thirsty. All men should be like you. You have such an innocent face. Everybody fucks me. Emilio fucks, Ferney fucks... Even Jonhefe who loves me, only fucks me. It seems you don't let anyone fuck you. I do my best. I'm sure you will get a girlfriend... ...and will fuck her too. You've known Emilio for a long time? Since kids. Since school. Have you always been friends? Always. You've never fought? Never. Not even over a woman? No, not even. Do you imagine, dude? Me cheating on Emilio with you? Rosario! Okay, I'll give you one more. Don't let anything happen to him. Have them go where they have to go. Have my boy arrive well. You never let me down. Get him back. This one... ...for the heart. Here, babe. And this one... ...so you don't get caught. But I hope you're not followed. A miracle: An Emilio's girl seated on this table. My son has been a womanizer. I'm sorry, but the women before Rosario... ...haven't been my girlfriends. Only friends. But there have been a lot. Poor ones! - All of them... - Mom! Emilio and I aren't a couple, anyway. Not yet. I'm putting him to the test. It's okay you think it before you make a mistake. Yes, madam. I don't want to make a mistake. Emilio told us you were studying something... ...what, Emilio? Design? Stop it. Stop questioning her. We'll have time later so she tells you about her. There's no much to tell, anyway. What? Are you studying or working with your dad? With my dad! Emilio told us he's doing great. With the country's situation, lawyers do really great. Excuse me... ...can you tell me where the bathroom is? Second floor to the right, child, down the hall. Will you grill her on the table? Where did you take that woman from? - What's wrong with her? - My God! - My God what? - Do you think we're blind? Stop it. Let's talk about this later. Fine. You haven't let her eat. Eat? Didn't you see her? She doesn't know how to eat. - She knows how to eat me. - Respect us, brat! I'm sorry, the second door wasn't a bathroom... ...but a closet. It was a mistake. We have so many things in here... Don't worry. I did what I had to do as well. I'm sorry for the squirt. Rosario! Rosario! Rosario! Rosario, don't leave. Come here. Leave me alone, son of a bitch. Go back and keep telling the shit... ...they want to hear about me. You don't get me. You don't know them. Stop it. If you wanted to show them a bitch like you're used to... ...you should have brought one and left me alone! That wasn't my intention. - Calm down and go back. - I won't! You know why? Because you're just like them! No, you know? You're worse than them! Open the fucking door! You see those people on the 6th floor? What will you do? Ask her to get out the balcony? Why don't you serenade her from here? I brought you to help me, not to make fun of me. How can I help you? Who knows who's up there? Who cares who's up there? Who cares, dude? I need to talk to her and I will talk to her. I don't know what to do. That girl makes me nervous. If that's what we came for, she also makes me nervous. Anyone gets nervous. She's so tough. Right? Do you like Rosario, dude? Me? Are you crazy? Then why are you so happy when you're with her? That means nothing. She's nice, that's all. - What do you talk by phone? - Nothing. Nothing? Stuff, dude. Different things. - I think it's strange, dude. - Why's strange? She talks nothing with me. The Sacred Heart... So it takes care of you. It's yours. Dude... ...I want you to take care of my Rosario. I want her to be fine. You take care. - Will you take care? - Yes, I will. You will, dude. What do you want me to do for you? I would do anything for you. Tell me! What do you want me to do? I would follow you down to hell. Please forgive me. They are saying you have killed over 200 people. You charge a million to kill and a million 100 for... It adds up. To love is harder than to kill. They also say... ...you had your tits and your ass done. That you're a man. That you're Pablo Escobar's lover. That you're the boss of the murderers. They say you kiss your victims before you kill them. Any of those scum bags deserve a kiss before they go. Okay? So it's true? Only... ...half of it. Only half of it. What else? What else do they say? Only nonsense. Imagine, they say I'm in love with you. They don't know what to make up. Rosario... Have you ever been in love? Dude... ...what a stupid question! No. Emilio! Emilio, please! ...don't let them get me. Don't let them get me, don't let me bleed... I want you to know for when I die... ...first of all, don't put me in a fucking recess... ...where they put everyone. I want a very beautiful grave... ...at the entrance of the cemetery. I want you to put pictures, to put flowers and music... ...so I'm not Ionely. And visit me every Monday. You heard? Why you give me that nonsense? Rosario... You will leave me your perfume! Jonhefe! Stop, scum bag! It's me. Antonio... He was killed. They killed Jonhefe. He was the love of my life. The only one who has loved me. That's not true. I love you. Well... ...we all love you. ... hallowed be Thy name; Thy Kingdom come... ... Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread... ... and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive... ... those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation. Hail Mary, full of grace The Lord is with thee, blessed... ... art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb... Holy Mary, mother of God Pray for us sinners... ... now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hey, dude, go with Rosario. She needs you. Dude... ...we'll leaving. Where to? Partying. It's not good to leave without doing what you like. Even if it's for the last time. The wounds are serious. All of her body is crumbling around. - I want to see her. - No. That's not possible. - Please... - No. Rosario has been alone all her life. Let me be with her, please. The doctor is operating. Sit down and I'll let you know... ...okay? Take care of him. You can keep a secret. I'm... ...head over heels over your sister. What can I do about it? What I told you about your sister... ...is our secret... ...and we'll easily take it to the grave. Easily. What you told him? Nothing. The truth. I told him how much you loved him. How can you be such a moron, fucker? How can you be such a moron? You're a coward. You're a coward. Who kill him! I want justice for him! I'll miss you! Please, don't leave us! Don't leave us! I ask God that your soul may rest in peace. Forgive me! Forgive me! Let's give him a farewell. They are faggots! Thank you, you mother fucker. It's okay, honey. You're not alone. I am with you now. I wanna die! His death was terrible! MERRY CHRISTMAS That fucker was left alone. - We have to do something. - We'll fix it later. I trust you. When I was about... ...11 years old... ...I was coming up one night, and I run into a man... ...Cache. That mother fucker dragged me to a corner... ...and he fucked up my dress... ...and then he fucked me. With time, I came across with the same man. It was daylight, but he didn't recognize me. But I recognized him. I'd recognize that fucker even if I were blind. He thought I had liked him. I invite him over to home... ...I gave her a soda, I put her in a wonderful mood... ...and he was lying on the bed, naked... ...very horny... Rosario! I'm back! Somebody came? You know? My mother is a clothe maker. She has a pair of very, real large scissors. And... zas! I cut his dick off. When she came back and saw the blood... ...and the walls, she kicked me out of her house. That's when I went to live with Jonhefe. That man was... ...my dad and my mom at the same time. Antonio... ...you are good. Good people always suffer. I brought you the flowers you love. You know... ...I only need... ...I need you... ...to help me and bless me... ...because I don't want to do what I have to, but I have to. If I don't do it, what shall I do? You understand? So... ...if you help me... ...I'll try to change. I'll be better. If you had had the life I had, you would understand me. HELL Rosario, it's a miracle to see you around. Well... ...you have always liked the unexpected. Are you busy? I have a meeting in half an hour... ...but come over here. Take a seat and have a drink. Rosario, you're so gorgeous. You're so nice. You know I'm faithful to my work. Only... ...only such an important judge like you can get me. There are times... ...you must act. You have always treated me right... ...taken care of me... ...protected me. Rosario, I want you all for me. All of you. Someone treats me better. Rosario! Rosario! - Rosario! - Jonhefe... Stop it! Rosario! Rosario, let's go! This went ugly! Rosario! Look who came to visit you, honey! Rosario... Dude's here. Honey... I leave you. Antonio! Rosario... ...so long... You've been here for so long? Listen to me. Why don't the 3 of us go back to Medellin? I got a small apartment, but... No, they're looking for me there... ...to kill me. Who? They. And the others too. - What others? Ferney? - No way, dude. Ferney is of the few people I have left. - Emilio told me... - No. Don't talk to me about Emilio. You know what Emilio told me once? He would go to hell for me. He never understood. I wanted to follow him to Heaven. But there's no Heaven, dude. No Heaven. That's not true, Rosario. Emilio... ...adores you. Do you know what I need? Time. Not now. It's late now. I need time... ...to recover the time I already had. Have you seen the musicians work over a time? But they can put more notes in there every time. I need to put more notes... ...in the time I already had. That way, I undo the things that I've done. I mean... ...I will. You have to quit this life, Rosario. I know. I know. But the life doesn't quit me. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name... ... Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on Earth and Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread... ... and forgive our trespasses as we... ... forgive those who trespasses against us. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with Thee. Blessed art thou amongst women... ...and blessed the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, pray for us sinners... ... now and at the hour of our death. Blessed souls in Purgatory, who will deliver you. Give us the love of the cross... ...which he paid the sins of his soul. Have mercy, Lord. Have mercy. Have mercy. Have mercy. Have mercy. Deliver of from all evil... ... you sacred candle, don't let us be guilty... ... and regret for the merits of Jesus Christ... ... and feel mercy for the tears we have shed. They join me to claim... ... and for the love she has felt all over her life... ... and please forget what their nature made them do. Have mercy. Have mercy. Oh, what a pain, torment and suffering... ... we hope You deliver us from what we've been through. Here I am in the Purgatory... ... in the bed of God, living my greatest torment... ... until I'm tired. Have mercy on me, have love on me... ... have the justice never stop, never finish. There is guilt, that's what I pay... ... Heaven have mercy, when will it come? Friends, where's mercy? They favor a stranger. No mercy on me. At least give me alms. An ungrateful person richly dressed... ... look at your creator, who will remedy your problem. You killed my brother! Fucker! You go away, fuckers! You go away, scumbags! You know! What? Don't go. I cleaned it so you still stick shit. It's not shit. What I stick there is so he knows I love him... ...and remember him. - Do what you want. Anyway, next time you put something, I'll clean it. Why can't you respect my pain? Why can't you see he was the only who stood for me? Everything I did was for your sake. Jonhefe knows... ...Jonhefe knows... ...everything I did was so you were good people. I tried hard so you weren't bad, but what? You went twisted since kid. You went to the streets since kid. We both know that's not true. You have such a great imagination, Rosario. Yes, like what I had to go through with your husband. Besides, I didn't have to go through that. - But you ended up liking it. - No. He ended up liking it. And you never forgave me that. Respect me... ...son of a bitch! I'm your mother! Thank God you didn't repeat my story. One can't... ...one can't ask the daughter respect with those tales. It's not a tale, Rosario. It's life. It's yours, fucker. She was shot. She's bad. She's being operated right now... ... and I don't know what will happen. I think... ... what happened between us doesn't matter. She matters. Emilio, I think... ... I think Rosario is serious, bro. Very serious. Emilio... Emilio! - What is it? - I want you to get out. - I won't leave you alone... - I don't want to see you. Go. Where's Antonio? Antonio left. He was always smarter than you. He has something inside. You're a moron. Moron, moron, moron! You're right. I'm a moron. But you're a mother fucker. Me, mother fucker, asshole? Now you'll see, fucker, I'll shoot you! You won't kill me, mother fucker. You won't kill me, mother fucker! You're crazy, bitch! But you'll end up alone... ...you mother fucker! Rosario? Emilio? Rosario, what are you doing there? You'll get ill. Come. I don't know... Emilio left? Done. Cover yourself. Who did this? - I am bad. - No, you're not bad. Yes, dude. You know I am. Rest. Rest. I'll take care of you. I like your bones over here. You have them so forward. If you stood up under the rain, they'll catch water. How are you? Once you were talking with Emilio, you told him... ...you met a person with a scar... ...that looked like a dog's palate. I thought: How curious is this guy to open a dog's mouth... ...to see inside it. For example... ...I didn't know how was to be happy... ...until one day my face hurt because I smiled so much... ...and my heart beat fast... ...every time I saw the one I love. Antonio... ...you saw what no one saw in me. I dreamed of you. Why you cry? Rosario... Police! Stand up! Get him off! Get him off! Rosario! Not him! Not him! Hey, Antonio. I have the books you asked me. Call me. See you. Antonio... ... are you there? It's Rosario. What a pity. I wanted to talk to you so badly. How fast months passed, right? It's almost been a year. See you tonight at the Aquarium's. Kisses. This is Aquarium's, isn't it? How long ago did it change name? 3, 4 months ago. With pleasure. What's up, Rosario? Dude, I wasn't expecting you. Good to see you. Patience. I'm tired, dude.
