What time is it now? The idea of coming back home and finding the Bill still there searching for the trap door scares me. l was at ways scared stiff of the trap door. - Why? That?s where Francisca punished her grandson. She?d take him by the ear to the attic and put him through the trap door. And poor Eugenio stayed foran hour or two in the dark without crying. l remember the first time we went down there. lt was a play our cousins from Oporto had done with us. Who are these cousins from Oporto? They were my father?s cousins, younger than him. Every year they came to spend the summer with us and sometimes we did plays. l don?t remember what it was. l remember Eugenio dressed as an angel. They always dressed him up, sometimes even as a girl. They didn?t like him much, he was the cook?s grandson. And that was the day we kept the key. At night we went up to the attic and through the trap door to the maid?s room. Eugenio taught us how to do it. l don?t think my mother ever suspected anything. l don?t believe it. Your mother always knew what we were up to. Especially when it led you to the maid?s room. You?re exaggerating. l?m always a bit ashamed when l realise that ?til now all my memories are connected to that house. But what?s binding you to it from today? - Everything Rita. You yourself. My parents, my cousins, Eugenio, Francisca, everything. Joao. - But Joao is dead. And l remember him going through the trap door. l remember the play. l don?t know why. And during the whole day when they were searching the house. The police questioning. lt was the only image that kept coming back: Joao disappearing down the stairs and Eugenio closing the trap door. l don?t know why. - Because it was a kid?s game, Playing at cops and robbers. - Rita, don?t simplify things. You never understood why l didn?t take your side. Why l didn?t throw Joao out of the house. No, actually l never understood. - l couldn?t. lt was an old pact. A childish one, you?re right. lt ended today. And it ended like l said. - Sure Rita, as you always said. THE JESTER From now on, l want to live alone. l mean with you. l want to live alone with you. Tomorrow we will start looking for a house. Lisbon exist because we invent it each time we think of each other everybody knows. Let?s go! Hey sailor! Right now l?m not interested in what?s going to happen. l don?t care. l know l want to live with you. Wherever you want. What time does the boat leave? Come on let?s go! We?re closing. But what would have become of us if Joao was still alive? Most likely we?d still be at the police station. Whatever the police know about Joao, they didn?t get it from us. And they don?t know much, l can tell you. What shall l have? A small beer and a bacon sandwich. l?m not serving anyone else. Got it? l?m not serving anyone else. You love listening to drunks! lt?s almost 7 a.m. But you haven?t answered my question. - l didn?t understand the question. Yes, you did. Only it doesn?t suit you to answer. For you this is water under the bridge. Come on let?s go! - We?re going... But l?d just like to know... - To know what, Chico? Do you want me to repeat what l think of all this? Getting a bit morbid, aren?t you? l want to know what you?d have done if the money?d come, and we could get out of Portugal. Quiet! You really want to know? l?d stay here. You?d go alone. l wouldn?t have gone without you. To think that only a week ago l decided to change my life... God! The day the film was restarted, remember? l remember the argument we had the night before. 5 minutes break. We?re going to repeat. lt?s good for the sound! And l remember that you were gone when l woke up. All l wanted was to get out of there, to finish that film, with everything that had happened, Ant?nio-Andr? on crutches... And when l saw the police, l just ran away. All morning l looked for excuses to hear about you. And l was panic-stricken when l found out you?d gone home. Anyway, if one of those guys in the photo turns up, l?d appreciate it if you?d give us a ring... You can count on me. Let?s go. Turn it on! Yes. How long ago? No, but everybody?s just hanging around. l?ve got a rehearsal this afternoon too! Can?t you focus more? By the way, is Rita still there? Okay, goodbye, thanks. Shut it off. Switch on the other lights. Chico! Someone wants to see you. To see me? Who? - l don?t know... But they look a bit peculiar. Looking for me? Are you Mr. Francisco Bernardes? lf you?ve got a moment, l?d like a word. About your friend Joao Manuel Antunes. We know he has been living with you since he came from abroad. lnspector Aranha, Police. l?d like a little information. - What film is this for? For ??The Three Mirrors??, by Ladislao Wajda. Do you like it? - Ask him to unroll them all. Can we see the others? - l?ve never seen her like that before. Very nervous, can?t concentrate. We began at 8.30 and we haven?t had a single good take! l can imagine. - What?s going on? She went racing off home. l was worried, l can tell you... Who were those guys? - The old bill. The good weather?s on the way. l hate that train! The guy next to me tried to start a conversation. l didn?t hear what he said. l couldn?t get a taxi at the station, so l ran home. l wasn?t sure l?d get there in time. - l heard the gate. And l was really scared of how ridiculous the scene would be. And l knew that, believe me. But l also knew we were going too far. Estoril, 22 June 1 978 My mother?s house was deserted, which was weird at that time. They were probably hiding, anticipating misfortunes. Nobody. Then l heard you upstairs on the phone. l stopped for a second between the portrait of Eugenio and your phoney self-assurance, trying to understand what was going on. l?ll come over, l?m going to Lisbon now. ln Estoril. 45 minutes at the most. Thanks very much. See you later. Seeing you so nervously pretending not to notice me gave me courage. You were expecting that l would speak first. And l decided to play it up. The police were in the studio. l?m not surprised. They?ve been all over today. lt?d been a false start, and l felt lost for a moment. While l was going up the stairs, l tried to think of another way out, anything that would make you stop. And you almost did, you know? l was shocked because l was convinced you were going to be... serious! l know. So was l. But l was too boorish. How stupid! Totally but it?s over now. Why don?t you put a stop to these moods? Or haven?t you even noticed you?re contradicting yourself? Don?t worry about it. No, l?m not. l?m very worried. You won?t solve anything by getting moody. This is the last mood you?ll have with me. ln fact it?s the only way to resolve things. lt?s the easiest, at any rate... But it?s over. - lt?s not over: you?re sneaking out the back way. The easy way... The problems you want to get me mixed up in aren?t much to do with me, see? l don?t know if you understand. - Understand what, Rita? You don?t understand. - l don?t understand. Of course you don?t. And l can?t forgive myself for taking almost 2 years to understand... That doesn?t make sense. l understand less and less. And l?m not going to try to explain again. l don?t think you want to understand. You live by playing with other people?s lives. And at heart you don?t live much. And l?m going to live alone, because l know you?ll never understand. l understand perfectly well that it?s difficult to live as a couple. That it?s difficult... to find the territory of the other. Chico, have we ever lived as a couple? We?ve lived like that for almost 2 years. Have you ever been able to find your own territory here? Yesterday it became obvious we only have 2 solutions: we either continue to live on foreign territory, the bad solution, or we take ourselves off and live the life we fancy. Yesterday it became clear my solution was the third: this one. But today, as usual, my money?s on your second reactions. Well today you?ve lost. Third solution, first reaction. You?re talking rubbish Rita! My God, we?re getting off the point. - l?m not. l?m just reminding you l was the first to suggest packing your bags. Both of us, which is more difficult. And more expensive. l don?t want to live on dealer?s money. Rita, you stupid. - l don?t like people who betray. That?s the way l was brought up. But who?s betrayed who, you fool? l?m sorry Chico, but it?s pointless to insist on what was decided last night. l don?t remember deciding anything last night. What was decided then? l?m going. Ah, so you?re going... And me Rita, am l going after you? Hello? Can you send me a taxi to n?26, Rua da lnglaterra. Will it be long? And you?re waiting for that old freak to... ...who did us the favour of sharing the good and bad times of our life together, to come up trumps with his murky little deals... and get very rich and be very happy and that you fill mumsy with joy! - l don?t want to be rich, Rita! Listen, there?s mumsy! - To hell with mother! To hell with mother! This doesn?t become you, Rita... You?re losing control. lt?s coming? Thanks. lf you haven?t got the guts to live with me to the end at least have the decency to leave without a scene. And excuse me for saying this, but you?ve no idea how false your arrogant air is. - Goodbye, Chico. Goodbye, Rita. And don?t forget your shoes. l left almost running. So as not to burst out laughing in front of you. lt was too much. And it was too late to go back, but at that moment l realised neither of us was taking the other seriously. You?re wrong. When you left l took you very seriously. The most difficult thing was to convince myself the day had to go on. The rest of the day l mean: to go downstairs and find my mother in tears, then back to the studios to rehearse, whether to tell your father we?d split up. Stupid! ln the evening... To listen to the inevitable advice from Joao. Waiting that he would go to bed and stay alone in the leaving room not having the guts to go to bed alone. l didn?t sleep out of anger. You should take more notice of what?s going on backstage. The cast are starting to act up. Joanna?s a b ag of nerves. You?d better do something, maybe praise her work more. l?ve got to praise her every day? Not as much as that, but she?s got to feel backed up. She?s banking on this performance and l think she?s really insecure. ls that okay? - Yup! Quim! Tell people to be quiet! Quiet! Attention...lights! Actors to their places. Quiet! Lights! Fire! At dawn on the day of Pentecost, 1 1 25, Gon?alo Mendes da Maia, whom, because of the many battles he had waged and his indomitable bravery, they called the fighter lit the flame on the altar of Zamora cathedral, so that Afonso Henriques could take up the arms on God?s table, and the knight himself, as was the custom of kings. Egas Moniz, Lord of Cresconhe, was to guide D.Afonso as one of his father?s most loyal companions at arms, Count Henrique of Portugal, who had fought until death for the independence of his lands. Then the adultery of his widow, Dona Teresa, with Fernando Peres de Trava, sparked a rebellion of knights supporting independence. Fernando Peres was from one of the most powerful Galician families, devoted to the crown of Spain. Portuguese barons naturally saw in Afonso henriques the centre of resistance against the growing domination of the intruder in the court of Guimaraes. lt is time, my Lord. l, Afonso, son of Henrique, by the right that is mine, do knight myself in the name of God. Egas Monis Coelho, nephew of the lord of Cresconhe, who was educated with Afonso Henriques had borne arms with the lnfante. Egas Moniz Coelho, do you swear by the title you are to receive that you will shed your blood for the cross, our native land and the King? Lord, l do swear this unto you. And to remain loyal to your lady and always to defend women and the weak? And to be as a brother to your equals, and chivalrous to all? l do, my Lord. And do you swear never to break your word or stain your lips with lies or calumny? l do swear before God. l will fulfil my oath while l enjoy your grace and love. l hereby knight you in the name of God. Be valiant, courageous and loyal. Since your youth l taught you to use the arms which together you hold vigil over today. And the heart of the old chamberlain who raised you together, is greatly rewarded this day seeing you attain the highest ambition of all young nobles. l saw you grow together, similar in temperament and character. And while l knew you to be brothers at heart today l see you united in the brotherhood of arms. lf in the battle of Sao Mamede when Afonso Henriques finally wrested power from his mother, or rather from the Count of Trava, fortune had been against us, we would likely be today a province of Spain. But in the progress of civilisation, we had a mission of fulfil. ln the westernmost redoubt of Europe a nation imbued with activity and vigour was to arise for whom the native land was too constricting. Thus by your hand l see a narrow kingdom cleaved out of Spanish soil but which will grow wheat form which to man live on, clothes with which to cover himself and iron to defend him. And in this kingdom, which will be the last western land in Christendom, l see a nation emerging to inherit your mission. What would be the relations today between East, the New World and West were Portugal to have perished in the cradle? Who would dare claim that without Portugal civilization would be the same as it is? Because on shunning Castile having seen the labour of marking the native land cease, this nation will face the sea. And the sea fires the imagination of those who look upon it, and fascinates them with the unknown, the mysterious, they love to ride the crest of the waves... Poor, weak, humiliated. After such glorious days of power and renown what are we left with except of the past? lt holds the treasury of our passions and content. Amidst a decaying nation, yet one rich in tradition: the ability to remember the past is akin to moral magistracy, priesthood. lt is the duty of those who can do and know this: because not to do so is a crime. Cut the quiet. Lights. No, Quim, leave that now. At the end of the afternoon, l?d decided to ask your father for advice. Look, Chico, l?m sorry... lt was me who asked Jorge to come. But the inevitable Jorge came to pick him up for rehearsal. Can l get changed? Yes, you can. l?ll phone you at home later. Jorge, what about the actor friend of yours? ??Cousin??. Or your cousin? He doesn?t look like turning up. We can?t sit around without doing nothing. l?ll send him tomorrow. A thing promised is a thing owes. And you can?t stand having to owe anything to anyone, can you? What about the others? The others are mine, Joao. l can bring them to show you, if you like. But you can?t keep them, they?re mine. They?re not yours. You appropriated them. But l?d like to see them again. l?m going to bring them, l?ve told you. As Ant?nio would say, it?s one of those days... A bit fed up. A feeling of... organised injustice. Slight paranoia, and shit scared. Chico, if you think l?d better take a holiday until things calm down at home. Our old friendship won?t be affected by the experience. At least not on my part. Which is pretty big. l?d never even thought about it. You mean Joao offered to get out so l could come back. And you didn?t accept? - Rita, Joao had nowhere to go. What?s all this about the photos? - They?re Jorge?s idea. Jorge knows l want to sell arms that don?t belong to anybody. And he knows about Andy, he says l should leave Portugal. He?s thoughtful, he?s offered to find me a buyer, but persuasive, he told me that he can spread it round that he knows about Andy. Joao, don?t you think your new friends are a little cheap? Don?t be presumptuous! You don?t deserve those you?ve got. Sure. But it looks like this is what l?m driven to. Joao was scared l knew him well. Jorge knew enough to blackmail him, l can tell you. Rita understood everything. She left because she wanted to. That?s the difference, Chico. l?m going when you want me to. Good morning, Egas. You?ve got a rehearsal this afternoon. l thought so... - We?re on the eye of the debut! May God hear you... Francisco? - Yes! ls it really the 1 1th? Of course! We?re only late because of money. lt should be next week. Francisca?... Joana?... - Here! Listen, you clown. two guys were here yesterday talking to mother. They must have been cops. There?s nothing like starting off the day well. Francisca? l?ve eaten, l ate upstairs. You mean l?ve been talking since 7 a.m. for nothing? l?m sorry. Take them to Joao. Why doesn?t he eat down here like everybody else? He?s not nobility! He?s working. Take them up to him, don?t be again... What?s this about the two guys yesterday? Look, two guys who looked like cops, to put it mildly! They knew everything: that Rita lives here, that Joao doesn?t do anything... They were inside for ages talking to mother, And what?s more Joao knew the police had been at the house, and he was worried because of my mother. Francisco, you?ve got to decide once and for all if you have breakfast with us or eat whatever you can get up there... lt?s not right: the poor woman was baking all morning just for you, and you whiz past like a hurricane and don?t even thank her! lt?s not right! lt?s true, we?ve got to have a word with Joao. There was a police inspector here asking questions about him. l suppose it?s normal they have files on people who were exiled. But he?d better try and deal with it as soon as possible. Don?t get excited. lt doesn?t do to frighten mother with these stories. l?m surprised the police don?t come here everyday. With the kind of people you bring home... The people l bring home is my business. Your criticism is just what l need now. Personally l don?t give a shit. l?ve nothing to do with your life. Every morning l got to the studio hoping to find Ant?nio-Andr? and the crew. To find out about your film. l don?t know. l can?t remember. That ??cousin?? is here. l?m Vasco, Jorge?s cousin. lt?s for the acting. About time too! Don?t forget, llda?s a bit nervous. The cast?s increasing nervousness left me cold. They were dreadful days. l?m sorry, llda, Have you been waiting for long? lt doesn?t matter. This is turning out very different... Now it?s finally looking like something... But l still don?t understand how you can put a stage in here. lt?s not easy. But it?s the only place it?s possible to do ??The Jester??. Don?t forget that in the end of the whole studio?s going to be the stage. Hello Maria... Hello Chico. Am l very late? l?d arrive home exhausted, drained. l wanted to open at all cost! Joao tried everything to entertain me. lf the ritual of fornication is satisfied for today, we get on to more serious things. l?m going to show you the scene l talked about... Corresponding to the 22nd of September. 1 97 1 , of course. We?re in the Aegean Sea. With a favourable wind we decided to leave for Paros, where we thought we?d land next evening if the weather held. No. We left from Helicon in the south. We?d finally left the colonel?s place. lf you remember, Andy had fever for almost a fortnight, and we had to wait at his uncle?s until he got better. We wanted to go up the west coast to return to ltaly, but off Glaronisi we stopped to go diving, to catch octopus and some fish. The enthusiasm we?d begun to film the ship?s log with had almost disappeared. At the beginning we really wanted to see it developed. but little but little we realised we didn?t have very interesting shots. Especially in Greece with the tourist and problems with the police. Andy?s illness had slowed us down a lot and we hardly had any money left. One of the crew refused to sail and there were just two left, beside the captain. Andy was still very week and he hardly left the cabin... We really had to get back to Zurich quick. Andy?s uncle lent him enough money for us to get to Brandisi and then get a train. We decided to sail night and day and just anchor for fishing. The first time we landed was in Glaronisi. What?s that? ls it an island? Yes. Deserted. lt?s only got rabbits. And cappers. lt?s a regular fisherman?s refuge, but that day there were no boats... We didn?t think there was anyone on the island. Then suddenly l found l wasn?t alone. That?s when l saw the scene l told you about. lt was a type of initiation, l don?t know if it was a ritual or a one-off, with young fishermen from the port nearby. lt was a bit tense at first but then they accepted me. They offered me what they had and insisted the rest of the crew should join us. But Andy refused to come off the boat, no matter how much l called him. He was shocked by how natural those guys were in the nude, and it was as if he was offended l didn?t react like him. From that day my relationship with him changed completely. There was a girl they?d brought from another village. As far as l could make out the oldest brought their brothers and friends of 1 6 or 1 7 so they could go with a woman. They went to the island to avoid the local gossip and scandal. l never understood if that crude display in the sun scared him. Andy was getting more and more dependent. The day l found him dead l?d been away in the North. Because he couldn?t stand me being away he decided to get his own back. But he chose the wrong partner. Francisco, l?m ready. Can you call a taxi? The scene itself didn?t surprise me. lt was Andy?s concern to keep away from it. l?ll come with you. We can get one in the street. lt?s got to be right now. lt?s really late. Calm down Maria. No-one?s chasing us. And didn?t you manage to find out how they disappeared? Andy would have followed Joao to the grave. And l was so depressed you?d left that l confided in Joanna. What did you expect? That l?d pat you on the head and say Rita was ungrateful? Chico, l?m not particularly keen on Rita. But l know how hard it is to live on that attic besieged by your mother. And to have to put up with Joao everyday! Nobody could stand it! There! l?ve said it. Shall we rehearse? Quiet! Of the queen?s ladies in waiting, one there was on whom, she had concentrated her aection and indulgence: and rightly so: she had brought her up from a baby. Little by little Dona Teresa began to feel a mother?s love. lt was rumoured among the young nobles that Dulce loved Egas Moniz. The young knight and troubadour who in Zamora cathedral had held vigil over the arms with the lnfante Afonso Henriques. Very nearly the same age, Dulce and Egas grew up together in the court. You?ll stay here now. You helpless thing. Thus unexpected Egas left for the crusades. The poetic souls of the age did not understand love without renown... Because at your feet lies dead my heart. Was it love that carried Egas into that life of battles? Who could say? - Poor troubadour! Return swiftly to seek the heart you left at the feet of someone who did not want it. After he left Dulce seemed sadder than usual. But 3 years went by. The young troubadour was forgotten by all: perhaps even by her. At 20 years old Dulce was an angel of kindness and beauty, who seemed to have totally denied herself to love. Three years!... Who knows whether Egas forgot too? Distance is can do more than the heart. - lt would be better if Egas forgot, because l have divined that Dulce?s eyes now rest with new favour on another knight... Bravo! Well said! Joao... be careful... l told Jorge to wait outside until the end of the rehearsal. He should hang around here the least possible. Amid the solemn Portuguese gravity of the court was a man who, free of tongue, could descend and climb the slippery steps of privilege. And on each step could banter with raillery and insolence. Traitor! Miserable cur! lt was the jester, peculiar to the Middle Ages, a monument to the memory of liberty and equality amidst the centuries of hierarchy and infinite status among men. He was named Dom Bibas and was held in great esteem by the Queen?s ladies. D. Bibas ever surprises us in the way he chooses to demonstrate right. Perhaps because he learned at my cost not to leave right in a stranger?s hand... D. Bibas, how different are the lessons life has taught us! Our callings are indeed different. l am the queen, and you the jester. ls it custom for you to say everything which pleases you to let vanity command your words? Are men?s hands to mould the right which governs us? l had never heard the voice which has guided our destiny, and perhaps l would not be surprised to hear such words from your mouth. Once there was a time when the daughter of Afonso de L?on could hardly bear any voice different from her own to be heard amid the silence of the knights of Portugal wary of the cry to offend. lt was the time the widow had to wait to see her mission fulfilled. Those days are gone... The son l raised can take that voice. His will can subdue mine. But the lnfante is forced to challenge you for this heritage by force of arms: the arms of knights and blackguards, whoever seem to flock to you... And who shortly may force right to favour the cause of Afonso Henriques. Right does not favour, D. Bibas: it embodies us all, and we serve it. The son l raised must reign, but not over an inherit kingdom. A kingdom should be conquered by arms, so that the nation dwelling therein might defend it as its own. Portugal is the inheritance l brought from Castile, and which for so long l defended: keeping it safe for the son l raised. Today the lnfante must first destroy me, queen by inheritance, so that he might be the first king. The king must reign alone that the people might respect and obey him. The foreigners who in Guimaraes say they protect, would never accept the defeat you consider imminent with your calmness... Fernando Peres was not born of kings... There is no safer refuge for a weak man than the love of the woman who was forsaken by her son! D. Bibas, pray do no forget that l suffer more than anyone, because l suffer for them all. ls it over? For today. What about Jorge? l?ll see to it now. Tomorrow it?s only in the afternoon. ln the morning we?re filming in the studio. l?m not going home yet. lt?s the only place l was sure to find you. l wasn?t going to send anyone else with this. And l had promised it. And do you usually keep your promises? Rita. l never told you, but Andy died in Lisbon. Also murdered. Don?t forget, Jorge, l know you. l hope so, that?s what l?m banking on. But l never ever want to be your partner again. l know you very well. Enough to know that all you efforts to solve my problems have got an ulterior motive. Definitely. l?ve never hidden my interest in solving your problems. lf l?m making an effort to solve them it?s because l think l?m solving my future. Even l don?t know all the truth. One day Joao got home and found him. He?d been stabbed. Jorge was a recent acquisition And helped him hide the body. lt?s Jorge. He was going to leave. He only came to give me some old photos l?d asked him for. Just a bit longer. - There?s no rush. l saw the photos by chance and l couldn?t stay home that night. But the next morning you finally came to the studio. l didn?t want to meet you there in front of everybody, but l couldn?t handle the scene Joana made when she saw me. Joao, it?s a bit ridiculous But it seems we?re the pigeon post sent to reconstruct... The harmony of this home? lt?s our duty. Hello Rita darling, how are you? - Hello Joana. l?ve been hearing about you from your father... How?s the film going? lt?s okay, but it?s hard work. You look lovely! Did you choose it? No, it was Chico. - Ridiculous, poor thing. l?m sorry to tell you but she reminded me of your mother. lt was your fault Rita. You should have spoken normally, in front of everybody. But unfortunately that?s out of my hands. Just say the word. - l did what l could. l even tried to be nice to Joao. But l wasn?t at my best. And ??The Jester??, how?s that coming alone? Badly Rita - depressed, bad-tempered, taciturn. lt?s not funny any more. lt?s all so fragile! l think all this crap?s getting worse every day! Chico?ll blow up before long. Just between you and me Rita, you?re not exactly helping him a lot... You?re got a nerve! The chairs go up the full length of either side! l know, but these arrived this morning. They were filming, where else could l put them! l can?t stand couples, Ant?nio-Andr?. l find them harder and harder to take. Among the host of gentlemen who surrounded Dulce with attention in Guimaraes. Only one could expect his favours to be reciprocated. lt was Garcia Bermudes, from Aragon, the favourite of the Count of Trava, whom he had accompanied to Portugal. Suffering is engraved on your face! Garcia, love has saddened you? Has Dulce betrayed you? No because she never loved me. - Never?! l thought just the contrary: perhaps l had a reason to think so. But if Dulce isn?t the lady of your affections, would l dare ask Garcia Bermudes the name of his lover and the reason for his suffering? Watch for the lights coming on in the bolero. Wasn?t Rita here? lt?s my destiny to live like this, sad agony to live without you. l feel lost in this world. What a pain in the ass. What?s made she act like this? - Women?s way, Chico. Dulce was a noble orphan. Her adopted mother, the Queen was to choose whom she was to be detrothed to. When the Court informed her of the oath he had made to Garcia Bermudes, two tears ran down Dona Teresa?s cheeks: Garcia was the chosen one. Well Chico? Well what Rita? Well it?s not easy, what did you expect? But you?re having a good time, aren?t you? - Not particularly. But you must get off with one of these pretty girls now and again... Now and again. Chico, you don?t look in the least bit ashamed. You would be My last disaster l?m always thinking about us, it?s horrible! Every second! And l always come to the conclusion it?s not worth it. We love each other, everybody knows that. You love me. l love you a lot. But it?s not worth making the effort Chico, is it? l?ve forgiven you... l?ve forgiven you because you managed to make my heart happy, and even though you won?t oer it your warmth again, you are my love. ??My last disaster...?? This bolero is one of the songs from the play ??The Jester??. Adapted from the novel by Alexandre Herculano, opening on July 1 1th in the Lisbon Film Studio. lt?s performed by ??A Carro?a?? Theatre Group. The director is Francisco Bernardes. The girl from the island and the ??Palm tree lsland?? advise all you natives to go to the studio en masse. l can?t wait any longer. l?ve got to go to work. Rita, do you want to have lunch with me? With you, the actors, the carpenters... no, thanks. l?d prefer to have dinner with you later, alone. l wasn?t planning to come back, l hope you believe that. l fell asleep with the cowardly intention of waking with the usual little note. But in the morning l decided to follow your advice: not to back away. While l was out l waited for my own reactions. But nothing happened. And in the morning l decided to stay. Even if the idea of facing Joao?s passive resistance was really irritating. l wasn?t going to leave you. l wasn?t going to shut up either. War was declared. The mornings in your house in summer always have the same effect on me: l get optimistic. - ln our house, Rita. lt was the only time l could be alone, had you ever thought of that? But it didn?t last long. As you very well remember, the arms buyers? boss came to the house for the first time that day. He wasn?t the boss. He was Orlando, the middleman. Jorge?s friend. For the knight who entered Guimaraes in disguide, everything was as before the sky, the night, the garden. Wretched soul! Only the love of a woman had changed. l?ll keep all the affection of a sister for you, But my love belongs to another: how can l share it with you? A rustle of leaves awakened Dulce from her daydream. My God! lt?s 3 years and a day since l swore in this very place to be here today at your feet! My oath is fulfilled. Dulce, do you remember yours? - My God! Egas! You here? What have l done to make you kill me with your unexpected visit? lt is not my fault if a flash of lightning from the sky breaks the chains of your contended days, sewn by treachery. My oaths are fulfilled, what of yours? - Not like that! Ana Maria, l don?t want the beginning like that! Francisco, l still haven?t really understood how you want it. l want you to be almost still. l want longer pauses between your lines. That?s the problem. How do you expect me to know what pauses you want? l?ll give you a signal. l?m going to my mark Francisco. Ana Maria, don?t be scared to drag out the pauses, l?ll cue you. Okay? Second and last warning, and this is outside normal duty hours. You know... that the police know... That your friend Joao Manuel Antunes... knows the whereabouts of a great quantity of arms which were in the hands of an extreme left wing party he was active in not long ago. Perhaps what you don?t know, but the police do, is the kind of company your friend as been keeping, including at your place. The police can?t reconcile it with political activities. To be even briefer could it be that your friend Joao Manuel Antunes is being blackmailed? l don?t know if you?re following me? - No, no. l?m not going yet. You?re an impolite and overgrown schoolboy. You should say, grow up and then we?ll see. When Egas, the noble troubadour, left to go abroad, His lover, in the sad moment of departure, asked him for a keepsake which bore witness to her sad foreboding. lt was the Toledo dagger he had brought with him. Dulce was a poor orphan, they could force her to be unfaithful; and then she would have to die; it was to die that she asked for it... Egas! l?ve kept my oaths until today, l swear them before God! Listen to but as few more of my words: They are the last you will hear from me! You were the only image l saw while l fought and suffered away from home. l dreamed dreams of glory for you. My sad cravings beneath the cedars of the Lebanon were for you, and with wistful tears l cooled these lips parched by the burning desert sun. l called your name in over 1 00 battles and when l did, my effort and fortitude grew. You were the lady of my thoughts, the divinity of my heart! l came back to Portugal hoping to find so much love requited. And what happened? My whole future fell at my feet in ashes because the future was in the hands of Dulce, and Dulce, who l thought was an angel was but a woman! Kill me first with this dagger that lies at your feet rather than with your words! Have pity on me, Egas, listen to me! For if you hear me, you will repent and say: ??Dulce, you are innocent! Those who accused you lied!?? Would that l could speak thus! Yet not long ago the mouth of a man who has never lied, unwittingly confirmed what the wind had already hinted. Don?t you love one of these adventurers infesting the good land of Portugal? Are you not soon to be wife to... - Do not finish this diatribe! Wife?! Only yours to the grave?s. Neither the whole world nor God is strong enough to stop me. Appearances are deceptive, Egas! l hope the last 8 days l have lived and which have devoured my life are nothing more than a cursed nightmare. Fallen angel, can l still adore you as an angel of light! lf Egas has a future in this world and you?re innocent, save me from myself. l know. l saw the car. l was waiting for them to come out. There?s something fishy going on l don?t understand any more. lt?s all so... unlikely. And you don?t seem worried. You worry me. l?m not forcing you to be brave. Don?t get mad Chico, but there?s no time to lose. Dulce! Tell me again you only love Egas! Swear to me it?s all true! l will do more: take me away from these courts if you can. l will leave the one who raised me as a beloved daughter and follow you. l will follow you, you who cannot abuse my love, because you are a loyal knight. l know how you feel, but l can?t react like that any more. lsn?t it a bit loud? Maybe l?d never have managed... - l remember you differently. Maybe, l don?t remember. - l remember you were obsessive. You?d change completely every time a new mania got into your head. Not very confident, but persistent. Always going on, whatever the cost. Now you just go along with things, and you scare me even more. lt?s fear. lt?s because you?d like to have the courage to do the same. To get myself in jams, forcing me to get mixed up in messy cops and robber stories? l wouldn?t like that. - l got mixed up for you. Do you have to justify yourself to me? You know very well l don?t. Do you realize how cynical you are? Or are you putting all this on to make me think you?re crazy? That you?ve turn into a kind of domestic child of God? Don?t you see l can?t get into your madness so happily? That there are serious reasons for me not to? That Rita would die if she had the faintest idea what was behind all this weapons business? The reasons you?re saying that are not your own. But only you know your reasons. The scenes between Joao and me got more and more childish. He knew as much as l did that there was not much to do than wait. We argued to break the tension. And l was scared stiff you?d wake up Lord, a spy disguised in the lnfant?s camp had just arrived, and he says the rebels are approaching. D. Afonso is leading almost 1 000 men at arms. According to what they say he intends to engage you in battle and he is with some of the lords of the court, and believes they will rise against you. Let the young noble come, and he will find my standards unfurled on the battlefield. There he will pay the price for his foolish daring! But he?s wrong to count on the traitors surrounding us. l know them, and the loyal ones! l?ll cut off the head of the serpent... Gon?alo Mendes! You came to the court at an inauspicious time, and dallied an inauspicious time! Listen! Tructezindo! What is your command uncle? What would you say, my gentle page, if within some few days to the sound of the clash of steel in battle. l were to make you hold vigil over the arms of a knight? You could well do this now, if you so wished, as promised, a year from now. The Count of Trava knew the Portuguese nobles would not be long to follow those who had already joined the lnfante. And attributed this success to the influence of Gon?alo Mendes, nobleman of the court of Guimaraes. l do not wish to add the years of your life to mine, lest they find me tiresome and overworked! lt will suffice that you repay my favour by faithfully executing the task l am to entrust to you. l will do so with pleasure! Your wish is my command. l want you to secretly follow each and every step of Gon?alo Mendes da Maia and the abbot of D. Muma. Approach them and find what they do, to whom they speak, and what they say. Then come swiftly to me and tell me what you have discovered. Go. Garcia Bermudes. the Queen of Portugal has just chosen you as her head standard bearer: you govern all her men at arms. Tomorrow after the banquet all bridges over the defences will be raised. No-one will be allowed to leave the castle. Not even l! Then the traitors who come to weave their perfidious plots will be in my power. And nothing will save them! Gon?alo mendes: neither the sword not the pride of a rich man will aid you! The executioner and chopping block will seal with blood the loyal friendship of the evil. Head standard-bearer of Portugal, these are the others of Queen Dona Teresa: ensure they are fulfilled! You are going, but you will return and they are going and will not return. Froilaz or froilao, Fernando de Trava and his brave champion, the fraud of Aragon, who covets beautiful Dulce?s hand. By the devil! - What would you say of Dulce, jester? This humble creature says you are foolish, noble Dom Garcia, to pursue my fine Dulce with your ridiculous flirtations, and that you, Count, would do all a special favour by visiting the owls in your castle on Galicia!... D. Bibas! Taking your crude Galicians and stupid Aragonese and leaving the palaces of Guimaraes to he who inherited them from his father. Dom Henrique, ancient nobleman of the court. D. Bibas, those who sent you to tell me what they hide in their cowardly hearts forgot to dress you in a well-protected coat of chain mail! Lord of Trava, the Queen wishes to speak to you forthwith. l was about to request just that. l wish to show traitors that in punishing their messenger, l also know how to punish them. Men at arms, drag this miserable creature out and throw him to the dungeons: l wish him flogged by the strongest of my horsemen, until the blood seeps from his back, as from his foul tongue surges foreign insolence! No, l shall not go! Do it! Forgive the gaiety of a jester... - Take him, men at arms. Then so be it! l shall be whipped like a vile Jewish serf! The jester will receive this ignominious punishment; but he will become a demon! You laugh, you vile renegade?! You laugh, you fawning courtier?! A day will come when thou shall cry! Come slaves: the orders of the cowardly Count. Cut the quiet. You can put on the lights and good night everyone. Same time tomorrow, good night all. Francisco, would you mind taking a message to Joao?! Do you think l don?t have anything else to do? Chico, if you didn?t like that guy, why did you give him a job? Because Joao asked me to, Rita, that?s why. Can?t you understand? How can he be indiferent to the whereabouts of the arms his comrades gave him to keep? That?s treason! But why? Has he concluded that his comrades? struggle doesn?t make sense anymore? Here, now... Somebody who fought for so long in such an unorthodox way suddenly decides the struggle?s over! No, that?s what doesn?t make any sense at all! He can be convinced it?s more important now to carry on the struggle elsewhere, without betraying your ideals. And it?s not easy going through customs with rifles in your luggage... That doesn?t mean he can sell them to gunmen! Gunmen are fascists! What about the police? Are they left-wing or what? A light held in the darkness beneath the castle glinted on the figure of the fighter and Frei Hilariao, Abbot of the monastery of D.Muma lt was your misfortune to wish to mock a poor old man you always found indulgent, and a knight who never mistreated you! You will not expend on me the only Currency with which you the powerful Bought everything you needed to satisfy brutal passions! D. Bibas wished only to pursue his calling, And you know full well that his calling is to make mockery No, Frei Hilarao. This way is the path to slavation for you both: and for me, to see what from here and forever will be the only thought in my life. Abbot of D. Muma, thou shall accompany me. Your friendship may be fatal to you: Count of Trava is not a man to respect the sanctity of priesthood. But who shall save the knights who await me? l shall! Leave, and await them at the mouth of the tunnel. ln a few hours they will all be with you. lt will suffice to give me a sign to make them obey me. Go, give this to my page and you will be obeyed in everything. May the virgin of Saint James be with you! And tell the lnfante this may be the gateway to the invincible castle of Guimaraes. Tell him that who opens it is D. Bibas The jester so beloved of his father And who on a foreigner?s command was flogged like a serf! The whole day! Up and down the street. Some in cars, some on foot! And they make a note of the time everybody comes in or goes out. Haven?t you noticed? - No, mother, we haven?t. No. l haven?t noticed, l haven?t noticed anything. lt?s frightening. ls it the secret police? No, it?s not even funny. lt?s persecution mania. Why should they want to watch the house? How stupid. lt?s drug paranoia. lt?s like that everywhere. That?s right...l know who?s going crazy. - However it is. lt?s getting worrying. And it?s not the tradition of this house to have the police at the door. The traditions of this house? Who remembers the traditions of this house? What a nerve! The sudden appearance of Gon?alo Mendes in D.Afonso?s camp Excited the knights. The Fighter was to join the lnfante, but to the very end he wished to avoid this horrible war of brothers. And it was in the name of peace that he spoke once more. Peace which l asked for a thousand times in your mother?s court. Let the Count yield the heritage of my lord D. Henrique. Let D. Teresa cede the sovereignity of this kingdom to her noble son. Let a final messenger go in the name of the lnfante And the noble sons of Portugal to propose these conditions. Before we propose them at lance-point. Once again l do so request and pray to those who dare accuse me of disloyalty. As l conserve my strength for the work ahead. And despise anything expressed in threats and warnings before fighting. But remember, the memory of many years of hatred may only be erased by blood running abundantly on the battlefield. And you lord, do not forget that also in this first battle the blood which must run will be of the vassals and peasants whose prince is the lnfante The blood of Christians, not of lsmaelites. Let it be as you wish then, though l am sureit will be a useless message. Do you not feel so yourself. Archbishop? At least your cousin, El-Rei of Lyon who has shown himself to be so against us will know that you tried to avoid war. - And who shall be the messenger? lf the lnfante will give his approval, l will be the carrier of this message. Egas, you must be prudent. Fernando Peres knows of your entry into Guimaraes. And half his lieutenants scour the town, in the hope of taking you. This better thus: it will save the Count of Trava the trouble of looking for me in vain. Well said, my brother. lt is truly a brave knight who goes to face the enemy among his own men at arms. But l will not consent to you again risking the foreigners? ire. Another shall go now in your place. l returned to Portugal to serve the son of my lord in peace. Or defend him in war. l did so to be loyal to my solemn promise and the fellowship of arms. Have l told you the lnfante owes me anything in return? You need not request the sons of the well-born to judge your demand when the Spains are at issue l accept the rights you claim, and swear that your recompense will be whatever you ask Do you hear this, prelates and barons? This is an lnfante?s oath. The award l beg of you is to let me follow this adventure as emissary. You cannot refuse me this. Then let it be so. And let the mother of God and St.James safeguard you from the danger you willingly seek The grandees of Britania are arriving! More than 1 00 crossbowmen demand the presence of the lnfante of Portugal! Lords, come receive them with me! Egas, l do not wish to lose you! Remember your brother in arms!... By the way, the film?s on tonight. Here at home this evening. l?m not making dinner. ln the homes of 5 million viewers After that we?ll eat out l?m not at all bothered about 5 million viewers. l?m scared l?ll look ridiculous. That?s because you?re proud Rita Aren?t there any scrambled eggs today? Make them yourself if you want some. And you?re so proud because you don?t think about what you say. ln the middle of all the tensions that were growing in the house, you won?t even imagine how those little fights between you and Joao got on my nerves. He never missed an oportunity to attack me when you were around. Joao, let?s try and understand each other. l don?t intend to fight you. l actually like your company... But don?t count on me to indulge your fantasies. l never have anyone indulge my fantasies. That?s another irredeemable difference between us. Francisco, l don?t think your realise how this attic stinks of mould. Hello, good morning! l?ve got bean stew today, do you want to have lunch downstairs? Bean stew?! Of course l do auntie, you can count on me. Joao and your mother were an unbeatable double act. When it came to showing l was in the way. Don?t exaggerate Rita. My mother known him since he was a child, She almost brought him up. lt?s not surprising they understand each other. Very good. l want the guards in their places And anyone who?s not in the scene off the set! What? With long pauses? No, you were right, with the music it?ll be okay. Quim, are you on your mark? We can begin. Go to the Queen?s quarters, my charming nephew. l must speak to Dulce, and it must be brief. As soon as the rebel messenger leaves the room, bring her to me. But D. Teresa must not know. But how can l speak to Dulce in the Queen?s quarters without her noticing? By the devil, make yourself invisible, hide among the shadows. But bring Dulce to me without anyone knowing! Then you may retire. Are you ready my handsome squire? An ill dispute brings you here as messenger of the rebels, unless in their name you have come to ask pity of the Queen of Portugal! l do not come in the name of the rebels. Grandees, nobles and barons sent me to tell D. Teresa and you, Count of Trava that from now on the son of Count Henriques is the lord of Portugal. By the ancient court of the noblemen of Spain and France. As the son of barons from Lyon and Bologna. Through custom and law here and in lands beyond he is the one to inherit the honour of Portugal. D. Afonso offers his mother the rights beholding to her as a Queen, and to you, safe passage to the home and honours of your predecessors. Have you finished? - Not yet. l must also tell that you refuse peace, tomorrow before his castle a great battle will be fought, Which will last until the judgement of God decides where justice and iniquity lies. Nothing more? Just one thing, Count: This message was addressed to you and the Queen. You have heard it. lt remains for her to hear it. Am l to be permitted to speak to her? Sir Knight, you haughty air is not enough to make you the emissary of Afonso Henriques. Show me your letters of credential. Who can claim that a man is what he seems? How often does a hidden motive force The nobleman to hide himself beneath the rags of the peasantry? Without doubt: there is nothing missing. To whom do these seals belong? - D. Afonso Henriques. And also D. Paio, archbishop of Braga, who follows him and Fernao Captivo, head standard nearer of Portugal. You are lying! The head standard bearer of Portugal is at my side, and he is not a miserable traitor. And Egas Moniz de Cresconhe, steward of the court. Court of madmen and the wretched! What infamy, you incitor of rebellions. And Gon?alo Mendes, lord of Maia. Gon?alo Mendes on the side of Afonso Henriques?! But how can he have left Guimaraes? Who aided his escape!? Messenger who came to face me leave Guimaraes for l swear you shall not talk to the Queen. You shall not talk to the traitors you sought! Because there are traitors among us! Tell the blackguards who sent you and the knights who are yet more villainous than they. That l, Count of Portugal and Coimbra, do scorn them: that they dare approach Guimaraes my knights will disarm them and l will have their eyes torn out by my horsemen and vassals! Do you understand? This is what you are to tell them! Thank God that punishment of disloyalty of a nobleman of Spain To waste useless insults on those who cannot reply if you refuse to grant me the presence of the Queen you may do so, but you are not fulfilling your duty to your mistress. Who gives you the right to teach me my duty?! Who ensures you, wretched mole who undermines the floor we are treading in the silence of the night. Why do you not dare show your cowardly head in the light of day, who says you will leave Guimaraes without me having your insolent tongue torn out?! Who dares talk of loyalty, who came to this castle yesterday like a nocturnal assailant? But yesterday, as today, your steps were wasted! My answer to the advice you bring is this! lt is the same answer to those who sent you! You are wicked and cowardly! Wicked, because you sold you body as a lost woman! Cowardly, because you can only offend amidst these famished harriers! You are a thief who would steal the noble land of Portugal from its true lord! Assassin, pick up this gauntlet if you dare! l will pick up your gauntlet, Egas Moniz! The lands and sword of the noble Count of Portugal and Coimbra shall not do battle with yours. Count, have the pailing built and nominate the judges. Pailing?! A pailing and judges?! A battlement will be the paling and the executioner, the judge! The chopping block and the dagger are for grandees: this madman, hang him like an lsmaelite cur! Men at arms, throw him into the deepest dungeon! Executioner, you can assassinate me, but it will be your last cowardly act. Because tomorrow the lnfante and the noblemen of Portugal Will be here to avenge me! Head chaplain! Have the hangman prepare three lengths of good hemp. The rope of justice must be healthy and strong! And have a friar confess a man whose body will, before daybreak, join the birds of heaven. Of the series of thoughts that rushed through the mind of Fernando Peres. There was a frightening and cursed one which made him smile. The time to deliver Dulce into the arms of Garcia Bermudes had finally arrived. ??Yesterday l promised before the Queen that you would be wife to Garcia. This promise must be fulfilled, or you will be the murderess of he for whom you exchange the head Standard bearer of Portugal.?? With the power of her final desperation, Dulce answers on a firm voice: ??No, Lord of Trava. Of what value is it to say ??l order.?? if l, noble and free lf l, granddaughter of the Goths, answer you: ??lt is not to be??? Who dares say here ??lt is not to be?? to the Count of Portugal and Coimbra? Who dares resist my will in these courts? ls it you who refuses to obey me? ??No, Count of Trava.?? Yes, l am telling you, nobleman. lt shall be so! Save me, dear lady, save me! The queen felt terror pulsating in the hand which had held hers. Sir Knight, your heart is loyal, as is your strong hand, and your noble and proud hair: Thus did l choose you as standard bearer of my troops. All those who have still not denounced the promise they owe me shall obey you. Thus did l wish to prove how l value one of the most illustrious knights of Spain. lf l die for you on the battlefield, l could only show that it was for loyalty, if not worthy of so many honours at least worthy of your confidence. Let us not talk of death! Such thoughts are a bad augury on the eve of battle. Your life is dear to me, and soon it will belong not only to you. You will have the most thankful repayment of your loyalty. This is your reward! - My lady!? l accept the hand of Dulce, queen of Portugal. Garcia!... Silence... Listen, both of you, to what l say: tomorrow, at this time, the head standard bearer of Portugal will have a wife, and this wife shall be Dulce. l hope your excellency the Queen when she retires to her chamber, will not allow the most loyal of her vassals to accompany her, so as not to disturb the conversation of two lovers on the eve of their wedding. The tone of the Count gave to these last words was heinous and devilish. No, you shall never be mine: you will not be my victim. Garcia Bermudes will never forget his duty as a knight. lf l accepted your hand in marriage it was to save you from the disloyal dealings they foist upon you. For l know you would die if they killed the one to whom you gave your love. l shall love you as a brother. l shall adore you as a God! Would it perchance be my most joyous existence to possess you when your heart has rejected me?! No Dulce, you may remain free, for l will not stay alone in this world. ln this age of life and hope it costs much to die! Garcia! How could anyone be more grateful than we are to you?! You have saved us both! Egas will be your friend, your brother, your vassal!... Tell him to flee a mortal enemy! And that l am that enemy! Tell him there is no place on earth with room for him, myself and my hatred! The day your film was on l told Joao l?d wait a week more then he either dropped out of the business and made a deal with the police or he took his guns and his bags and left. He agreed. Ant?nio, you?ll see now. Didn?t l tell you? Everything grey! Television?s a disease, it?s not worth it That?s for sure. Grey?s the colour of fire curtains. Of your eyes Django. Shut up. We can?t hear. lt?s impossible, the necklace! lt couldn?t be bigger! But it?s just right, Rita, just what l wanted. But what don?t you like about it Eva? - The plan of the cinema... l?m sorry Ant?nio, l can?t stand this! l think it?s funny... l don?t like this kind of film. - You only like James Dean! How much is it? A cake, brandy, coffee... 7 escudos. - Keep the change. So much money for so little is also exaggerating. See you tomorrow. - l won?t be here tomorrow. Are you going away? - Yes. Where to? - Angola. Are you going to fight? - l have to. Good man, you?re going to defend what?s ours. l?m going for two and a half years... - They say it?s though. But be brave! And fight to the death! l?ve rung, don?t you want to go up? No, your mother might listen. We better be carefull. Good luck. - Thanks. Wait just a bit longer. l?ve got to go now. What about tomorrow? My father?s taking me. But where are you going now? l?m going for a stroll. To say goodbye to Lisbon. Do you know who?s around? - No. The devil. l?m looking for St.Anthony. See if l can break the spell... What do you mean by that? l?m going to ask him a favour. After all?s said and done. lf this war drags on. What can l do against the devil? l?m going to ask the saint for help. l know it won?t do any good. Until the boat comes back. l know Lisbon?s over. Lisbon exists because we invent it. Each time we think of each other. l?m shocked Rita. l thought you?d already understood That one of the qualities of an actor is never panic before her own image. This is pathetic, Chico. lt?s Portugal , it?s... Your fear of the ridiculous is portuguese, Rita. And we?d agreed to leave Portugal, hadn?t we? Rita, never keep the producer waiting before signng a contract. Let?s go. We should warn him it?s just a copy. - He?ll definitely ask for a viewing. l told you this?d be the result. l can?t act in films. How stupid Rita. lt couldn?t be better. Right Rita, now stop acting on stage. Have you brought the car? No. l came in Eva?s. Rita, do you remember that scene you did? l was so excited l completely forgot my war with Joao. Joao, l don?t think he?ll last to the end... lt?s not necessary Rita. Let?s go. l had no idea the movie would please. Let?s not exaggerate, Rita. But it was the last good day we had at home. Did the ??cousin?? arrive with the good news? l didn?t see him. But you?ve got to admit it?s terrible to be forced to see ??cousins?? coming in here every day as if they owned it. And you don?t give a toss. lt?s guys like these ??cousins?? who know others, who might just be interested in buying arms. And l?m more and more oubtful about the success of it all. How rapid, and yet eternal too, is life for those Who know they are about to die! Eternal because of the infinity of thoughts Which rush through the mind of the condemned. Swift because of the way the tremendous hour approaches! And what does it matter? Everything is to die! What does it matter? Everything! Because l love! For life is sweet for me because of her! Because ignominious death is ignominy For the lover of the man who died in ignominious torment. At least assassinate me here! But do not stain my final hour with hatred! lnfante de Portugal, save me! See how they wish to cover your Egas with infamy! Dulce, l shall never see you again! lf l could say l loved you faithfully and purely till my last day, and that this day dawned because l came to fulfil my last promise! But between us are these heavy vaults, and my voice cannot penetrate them to call you, to repeat that l am to die because l loved you as no woman has ever been loved! Dulce, l will never see you again! My God, you can save me! lf not from death, at least from ignominy! A door began to open quietly and someone entered the sinister room. lt was the figure of a woman. She was dressed as for a banquet. ??Dulce, God has heard me, He wanted to see you on earth again. He wished to sweeten my lingering death.?? ??You are not to die, answered Dulce, you are free. The lnfant approaches and the Queen wishes to save you. The hidden door of this terrible cell is open...?? Only l have been entrusted with knowledge of this secret path. Amidst the confusion you can leave Guimaraes. Go...go with delay! We shall both go: you and l have to fulfil our oath. Egas, what you demand is impossible... because the sun which will soon rise will light upon a battlefield. Can you remember our oats when there is a sea of blood before us? And does it matter? Beyond that sea of blood will be peace for you. And between enemies and friends l shall guide you through it. Then an hour will suffice and l shall settle all my debts. What you demand is impossible! l will be safe in this castle. Then...lf you knew... My God, leave! Delay and we are lost. lt was a cruel plot the Count of Trava hatched. lf Egas loved Dulce he could have given him another martyr of death: if Dulce loved the youth, she herself would be the instrument of this martyrdom, believing she was saving her lover. The same afternoon, when the cries of The lnfante?s approaching army were heard. Garcia Bermudes took Dulce as his wife in the chapel of Guimaraes. lt was in the middle of a wedding banquet, when suspicions invaded the expression of the knight who should have been the happiest, and the heart of the woman the others envied was exploding with pain. lt was then the cry of ??foes?? was heard: it was at the sound of trumpets and the knights? quicksilver disappearance that the woman who?s heart exploded with pain found herself alone. lt was the bride: the groom had also left. And then the wretched woman ran to hurt herself at the feet of the Queen and obtained your freedom... Do you know who this bride was? You have guessed!... l had to choose between your death and being wife to Garcia. l did not hesitate. And yet l was still defrauded: you had to die... Now here l am... Come if you wish... You will flee with an adulteress... lt will be the name the world will write on the face of the one you loved so much. Eternal damnation be mine! Damnation upon you, who assassinated me! Egas, forgive me for saving you! For your love, which was so pure, do not hate me! Who knows?... Before us is youth and the future... Flee... Save yourself, there is still time! Withdraw, wife of a foreigner! What do you want from a condemned man? Let me go into the jaws of hell without persecuting me on the way... Flee! Why should l flee?! Be off! Jailers, take this shameless woman, who is trying to tempt a dying man in the solemn hour if his death! Suddenly, the maiden?s pallor turned to a blush. You shall die... But l will not be long behind you... ln a better world, you will furnish me with justice!... Providence...lies! Forgive me, my Lord! Who are you? What do you want from me? The noble Count of Trava has sent a priest to give the last rights to a man who is about to die. l will hear your confession when you consent, my brother! Do you know me, Egas? Do you not remember D. Bibas, who you played with in your infancy? How ungrateful, you have forgotten me! l choose my own friends. What l don?t know is how l make you see once and for all that you?re not a part of that choice. You?ve never chosen. You wait to be accepted. Your friends think you?re odd, but they shy away when it?s a question of helping you face life in your way. l know you as well, Joao. Enough to know this is your last chance. Joao, the guys are coming to your house tomorrow after lunch. You can count on me, Joao. - Perfectly. To see the one who murdered your soul lying dying at your feet, and to spit in his face and laugh! To torment him with your laughter. Don?t say another word: you?re right. Vengeance is the supreme pleasure for an outcast. l didn?t accept freedom from her. l accepted it from you. After that, my God have pity on me. There?s no time to lose. Take this habit and leave. Hunched up and hiding your face, the guards will never recognise you. The rest is up to you. But what will become of you when they find you here? Do you think that if my head was at risk l would expose it to save you? They will leave me here: because the Count of Trava will not return tonight; and tomorrow Gon?alo Mendes will come and free me... l know he will come. There is not a moment to lose. Man of Aragon, l have sent you my avenger! Count of Trava, Gon?alo Mendes will not be long! A castle of 20 lashes! A villain is more generous than you! When l went home at lunch time l thought l?d gone next door by mistake. l never tire of saying it. But what a wonderful little place you have here! Here is your equipment then. This is the G3. A G3 automatic rifle. And this...this is indeed a semi-automatic Walther pistol. Very good, it tallies perfectly. This is the equipment ordered. And it seems to be in perfect condition. But you will have to have the last word on this. So if you?d like to examine it then... This is the G3. An automatic rifle. And the Walther. Perfect. So we?ll have to agree on the conditions and date of delivery. Exactly. So very soon we?ll be in touch. A very good afternoon for you. l counted to ten for thinking nasty thoughts. But Joao was over the moon. - Very good! lt tallies perfectly! So very soon we?ll be very rich. Won?t we? Joao, are you fully aware of the dangers of this deal? Fully. Thus, we only have to agree the conditions. Egas, very low. Don?t forget you?re speaking to youself. Go on. You too smiled at the idea that death would take a noble victim today, here: which of us, Garcia Bermudes? One or the other, what does it matter? For whoever perishes and whoever triumphs. Tomorrow will be a day of rest and peace. A fierce battle was fought in the field of Sao Mamede. Where the army of the lnfante engaged his mother?s and the Count of Trava?s. After a long battle Afonso Henriques triumphed and Dona Teresa was forced to flee to Spain with the proud foreigner. When he pulled his sword from the heart of the man from Aragon. Egas heard the shouts of terror of the enemy peasants, who all fled. Then, calling two men at arms, who were holding the Castilian prisoner, he said: Leave him! You may go free, but you must do as l command. Hurry to the queen?s tent and tell the noble wife of the head standard bearer of Portugal that her husband and lord orders her to Guimaraes monastery where she will find him awaiting her at nightfall. You must fulfil this without reply or delay, because the battle is lost, and only thus will she save herself. Go! Make a stretcher and carry this body to the monastery. Tell the abbot that Egas Moniz requests an honourable grave for such a noble and valiant knight. And tell him my oath this night must be fulfilled, and that we shall see each other still today! We shall see each other! After the body which is sleeping the last sleep, the one which is breathing and seems to live: l shall also have my grave! On my father?s birthday l almost saluted the cop who was watching the house. Chico, you?ve forgotten the wine. - Yes, l have Rita. We?re drinking Ribena... - Not today, please! lt?s a party. Perhaps we could take advantage of it and make up... Yesterday, when you arrived you interrupted the only conversation that could have shed some light on Joao?s death. Joao had bad news. Jorge has finally decided to put his cards on the table. Or at least, for the first time Joao described the situation completely. Rita, your father?s arrived. What?s Chico waiting for? - Chico?s just finishing. Christ Joao, get on with it. lt?s nearly ten o?clock! Dinner?s ready. You know l hate arriving late, but in Estoril l only know the road to the casino. Even if you?re late it?s time to start playing safe. Welcome, Joao Portugal. - And congratulations. When Jorge came with your father l understood he wanted an answer from Joao. He made it clear: if the weapons were sold, two thirds of the money should go to him. Or half, if Joao left Portugal with him. Only during dinner l could see Joao gave him a straight no. You know how much Joao liked your father. They didn?t allow anybody else to speak the whole evening. You great spoilt kid! There?ll always be somebody to look after you. Every time Jorge opened his mouth Joao would interrupt him with some question to your father and restart the conversation to show that he had no place at the table. But you Joao, you could think for the pair of you. l think Jorge understood. - Let?s have a go in l?, shall we? The night my father killed himself we?d tried to steal his rifle to go hunting with Eug?nio the next morning. l mean, Joao went to get it while l kept watch. lf the piano stopped l?d knock my father?s door and ask him some question about my homework, to keep him busy, so Joao could save his neck. lt was always like that. l entertained and Joao did it. Now l?m getting a little morbid. Hurry up. ...this nation will face the sea. And the sea fires the imagination of those who look upon it, Chico. Don?t waste time, Chico. Swim if you want but go. lf Joao didn?t get his money we could never leave Portugal, Rita. No, if you wanted to live with me we?d stay in Lisbon. And we?d move out of your mother?s. And so here we have our friend. We were already taking care weren?t we? Tomorrow, between half past midnight and 1 o?clock. Orlando and Vasco the pigeon post will be Estoril with a van. Park a long way from the house, in the corner, and wait. Don?t blow the horn. Obviously you don?t ring the bell. Wait for me to come. And with the whole piece, in cash. All of it. l?m sorry Mr. Antunes, but it?s half in any deal. That?s how we do it. So the first half... The whole piece, in cash. Why don?t you go to bed? - l?m waiting for Joao. l don?t know if you noticed, but Joao left right after dinner. l asked him where he was going, and he said he wouldn?t be long. l never saw him again. He went to talk to the buyers. To anticipate Jorge?s blackmail. And because he knew l was depending on the money he?d promised me. The last time l saw him was today during rehearsal, a few minutes before he died. l know he came home in the morning. When l woke up it was really late and everybody had gone. Your father saw him. Your father?s desperate Rita. Jorge hasn?t shown up since he left yesterday. Hello Joao. Good morning. A fine example. Hey, won?t somebody give me a hand? - Why didn?t you wake me? l went out really early, there wasn?t even room to shower at home. l?m ready. We can begin. - What is it now? Orlando phoned, in hysterics. Two of the guys were arrested leaving the bank with all the money. He says it must have been a tip-off. Tell him to phone me at home later, at dinner time. My lord has not yet come. He was the only one to delay. Dulce obeyed her husband?s message without joy, without bitterness, without confidence and without apprehension, without wishing to remember the past, without thinking of the future. He sleeps the sleep of true rest. How l would like to sleep it too! Why have you brought me here? Who are you? Who dares lay a hand on the wife of the head standard bearer of Portugal? However eternal it were, your wait would be useless. He came here before you. lt was l who guided him: l who in his name summoned his wife; l, who wishes to see you united. This is who l am: this is where he is. Joao, the man?s here. Orlando. l told him to phone you, but he?s here. Under the circumstances my clients are not interested in the deal. l?m completely unaware of the circumstances. My clients will certainly check up on that. This is all extremely unfortunate! Egas, why don?t you pray for Garcia Bermudes too? The knight destiny wished to be my lord and husband was a noble and generous man. He died defending his Queen: God will pity him. lf you pardon him, as l have, the evil he involuntarily did us. Widow of the man from Aragon, l curse the murderer of your husband. Do not pray for the condemned, the gates of hell do not open for prayers. He who you prostituted yourself for exchange the wedding bed for eternal torment: let him rest there, and do not mix a heavenly thought with the abomination of our existence. Dulce?s breath was short. Slowly, she turned pale and in an almost imperceptible voice replied: God will repay you for the good you have done me with those words Egas! Your image was engraved purely in my soul. You disturbed that image with the mire of an assassination: with your fist cowardice. Now l can die. l would but ask you to be off, so as not to hear or see you... let me die with the memory of our innocent love; let me love Egas until the end; let me forget you, because you are no longer he! Egas, dear Egas, yake away this vile and perverse man, who dares call your Dulce a lost woman... Come... oh come! Egas! You love me still! To die! You are right! My polluted lover cannot remain on the earth. The grave is the crucible which will purge you. Die, for l will soon follow. Son of a bitch! You are completely mad, you son of a bitch! What do you want, for Christ sake? l want you to know that you can count on me ?til the end. That for better or for worse you can count on me. You?re in my hands, Joao. A novice from the monastery was found dead as dawn broke on the third day over the Tombstone of Dulce?s grave. May God remember their souls. Here l am, my brothers! You?ve had it Joao, you?d better beat it. The guys will soon find out who?s responsible. You beat it. Get out of here! l?ve never killed anybody, but l swear you?ll die if you ever meddle with me again. How blue is the sky and how peaceful the sea, D. Bibas! lt is the peace which has finally dawned on these shores. They are the shores of a calm sea, my lady... ldiot. Francisco! Francisco! l?ve spoken to the lawyer, he?s going straight to the police. Francisco, please keep in touch. What worried me the most was that l didn?t know what you felt. A horrible desire to leave once and for all. And did you hate me? No Chico, l felt sorry for you. Really sorry for you. And for the first time l felt l couldn?t help you. But it?s over now. There?s something not quite right here. A guy like him wouldn?t sell guns for the revolution to those people. He?d throw them in the river, he?d lose them one night, l don?t know... l don?t know either. Give me a ring later when you?re through. About dinner time at my place. Okay, l?ll phone you from the Department. Don?t ring after 1 0, l?ve got to go out. But he wouldn?t sell them to people who are... the lowest of social scale. He?d hand them to the police before that. No matter how much it cost him. ls there a step below the police on the social scale? l?ll be waiting for you downstairs. Two minutes. What are you doing here? Go home. l?ve had enough. l?m fed up of this. Let?s get out of here now. Rita, it?s over. We?re going home. And what about me? Can l go too? You just sit there and relax. But what am l doing here, for Christ sake?! What time is it, Chico? Ask for the bill please. - Shit! Would you mind making less noise? Shut up man! Can?t you see he?s right? Don?t be common. Where does he think he is? ln a boarding house or something? Let?s get going! lt?s time lads! Let?s go! Get me the bill please. Would you leave please, l?ve got a lot to do. Look at this! Sailors! Where?s the navy going then? Up river? How sad! l like sailors. My son was a sailor. Actually, he was a marine. He?s in Germany now, he works for Volkswagen. Good for him. There?s no future in this country. What about my beer? lt?s over. l hate daybreak. Where are we going, Rita? - Wherever you want. l don?t feel anything. Joao?s dead and l don?t feel anything. As if it made sense, like a story you already know the end of. Excuse me, what time is it? - 7 o?clock. Where do you want to go, Rita? - Wherever you want. l?m tired. Me too. l feel like going to bed. But first l want to be sure you want to come with me. Of course l want to come with you. Joao?s dead hasn?t made me change my mind. But you said that if l wanted to go, you?d let me go alone! Yes, l did, that?s true. l also said if l came back it was because the only way to stop you was not to leave your side. And l never doubted that all this fantasy would only end in disaster. That?s what surprises me about you, Rita. Your solid convictions. lf the world was exploding one day you?d have time to say: ??lt was obvious this mess couldn?t end any other way??. You can?t imagine how my solid convictions have helped. Today, l mean. Speaking of messes... What if Joao?s game had worked... Don?t you think all this conviction would have been a bit shabby? Shabbier than the game itself? The result?s on the way. Rita, you?re becoming a caricature of this country! Portuguese is your fear of the ridiculous, Rita... What else do you think you can be outside Portugal if not a caricature? But we agreed to leave Portugal, didn?t we? Do you think it?s worth being a caricature of this country in another? Do you think they?d find us funny? l?ve got no idea, Rita. We could try. We could, but it wouldn?t help much. l don?t want help, Rita. But you need it, like everybody else. The bad thing here is that we get used to waiting for other people?s help. And l want to know if l?m capable of helping myself. What you want is to gain, time, Chico. And you?ll end up by wasting it. - Like everybody else. Time ends when it ends, it doesn?t matter. Chico, l?m tired. Let?s go home. - Don?t you want to stay in Lisbon? lt?s daytime, l want to talk, to walk. The good weather?s on the way! Do you want to stay ashore? Do you think? Lisbon exists because we invent it...
