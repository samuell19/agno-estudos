"In to this seething troubled territory came John Brown." "My father." "He was a man of whom the world knew nothing because he had done nothing." "The things he was to do will never be forgotten." Remember. All men are born free and equal before God. And He has sent us into Kansas to do His sacred work. All Kansas shall be freed. And every man, woman and child in it. It shall be free. Now they are calling him a menace. How do they get away with printing things like this? It's got so anything that happens, he gets blamed. Keep your voice down, Oliver. This newspaper is no worse than the ones on the other side of the fence. Personally, I think that the papers on both sides are a little hysterical. We'll find out what's going on when we get to Kansas. You Yankees. What paper you reading? Who wants to know? Have you heard of the Border Ruffians, mister? Sure. Professional killers from Missouri. - Take it easy, Oliver. We ain't professionals. Sometimes we kill Free-Staters for the fun of it. Get back to your seat and stay there. Touch that knife and I'll break your back. They are Yankees alright. Wait! Don't you realise there are children in this car? Look Lady, you stay out of this. - I won't stay out of it. You and your friend are murderers by your own admission. And if you are a Free-Stater as you claim to be .. You supposedly believe in the dignity of man. Is this how you show it? Brawling in public. The lady is right, Oliver. Go on back to your seat. Mind your own business. You're finished, mister. - It's all over. Try another car. You heard what he said. Get out of here. You alright, Miss? I was trying to prevent violence. I didn't succeed. The best way to prevent violence is .. Not to strike the first blow, Miss. And a nice one she struck too. You are right. Thank you both. You going to the end of the line? Farther than that. Lawrence. So are we. My name is Elizabeth Clark. I'm from Illinois. My name is Brown. I'm Oliver and you have got Owen's hand. I am very glad to know you both. You are not related to John Brown? Yes, Miss Clark. We are two of his sons. You will excuse me, please. I'd better get back to .. Just a minute .. - If you don't mind. Look around and see if anybody is here to meet us. I'll get our baggage. I'll help with the baggage. - Look around. At least you can let me carry your baggage. I have to wait too. Oliver, over here. How are you, Oliver? - Just fine. Just wonderful. Get out of it. Wait. Stop it. Where is father? - Take the rear end of this crate. Father will be along in a second. Where is Owen? Busy. You mean he didn't come? I mean he is busy. Where is father? Oliver. I'm glad you are here. Where is Owen? Looking for a girl. Help Frederick put that crate on the wagon. Thank you. - Miss Clark. Please, Mr Brown. - I know why you feel the way you do. Then perhaps you will stop annoying me. You can't possibly believe all the things you've heard about my father? I believe he's a dangerous fanatical man who is doing our cause much more harm. And I want nothing to do with him or any of his raiders. Now if you will be good enough to give me my luggage. You're wrong about him, Elizabeth. Even if you weren't, you are unfair to me. We only met a little while ago. Can't we start from there? Owen. Frederick. It's good to see you. Miss Clark, this is my brother Frederick. Pleased to meet you, Miss Clark. Owen, father is over there. Owen, my son. - Hello, father. I trust your mother and Watson are well? Yes, sir. Fine. They send their love. - Good. Miss Clark, may I present my father, John Brown. I am honored, Miss Clark. How do you do. Miss Clark is from Illinois. We .. We've been discussing your work here. Not my work, Owen. God's work. That's what we are doing here. Have you come to live in Lawrence, Miss Clark? Yes. My father is a merchant. That would be William Clark? A fine man. Please give him my goodwill. Owen, we have a considerable distance to go. I'll see you soon, Elizabeth. As soon as I can. It's a pleasure to have met you, Miss Clark. Come along, Owen. Elizabeth. Well .. How are you? - Fine. Fine. I am sorry to be late. Wasn't that John Brown you were just talking to? Yes. Do you know him? Well, I only met him once. A great man, Elizabeth. A great man. I wish I had arrived earlier. There it is. Pottawatomie. Not much in size yet. But growing. The Lord's justice has many followers. Looks alright. Let's get going, father. Owen and I haven't seen our brothers for a year and a half. John. Down the road. They're coming. Jason, Jason. How is mother and Watson? Fine. You look great, all of you. The country agrees with you. - Father, it is good to be together. At last I am surrounded by all my grown sons. I am a proud and happy man. Oh God, my heart is fixed. Through God we shall do valiantly. For He it is that shall tread down our enemies. Amen. Amen. Owen, Oliver. Off with those store clothes. There is work to be done. Oliver. Owen. George Wilson. Henry Thompson. Ned Green. - Glad to know you. Pleased to meet you. - Come on, fellahs. We've work to do. Captain Brown. Captain Brown, look over there. What should we do now, Captain? All of you. Go on with your work. Frederick. Salmon. John. Get your guns. The rest of you, stand here with me. You are Brown, aren't you. I am John Brown. Yes. My name is Martin White. You may have heard of me. I have. Then you know I am a man of my word. I have something to tell you, Brown. I believe I know what you have come to say, Mr White. I'll say it anyway. You are not wanted here in Kansas. We're giving you 48 hours to leave the territory. I am a homesteader. So are these other people. We have every right to be here in Kansas and here we shall stay, sir. Is that your last word? - It is. You are a dangerous traitor. I have given you your last opportunity. Alright. If it's bloodshed you want you shall have it. I promise you that. No blood has been shed here nor will be. Unless you shed it first. I suggest that you and your rabble leave this place and stay away. We have important work to do. You are doing the work of the devil, John Brown. And you will pay for your sins. I am sure of that. When I sin. But not you, Martin White. Does this happen often? Those slavers really meant to shoot you. Yes, I believe they did. They'll be back with more men, won't they. Have you got guns for Owen and me? They won't come back right away. They know we are armed and expecting them. But the answer to your second question is Yes. There are guns for you and your brother. And when it comes time for you to use them. God's hand will be on the trigger with yours. Now, back to your work. What's the matter? Nothing. He is alright. Why don't you rest awhile, John? I'd better get back to work. It's quiet and peaceful here. Have you been here before? I asked one of the fellows in the camp where he used to bring his girl. Used to? Used to. They got married. He is a nice fellow too. You don't approve of marriage? Only for women. You've got a nice sense of humor, Elizabeth. Why? Because I laughed at your jokes? - Because you are nice to be with. It was good day for me the day we met on the train. Even though the circumstances were unpleasant. Maybe it was a good day and maybe not. What do you mean? I like you, Owen. And I don't want it to get any more serious than that. It's more serious than that already with me. I'm sorry. Perhaps you would feel differently if my name wasn't Brown? I might. My father's fight against slavery is right and good, Elizabeth. I've never questioned that. It's his methods. They are right too. You will see. You are too sensible to believe the lies that circulate about him. How do you know they're lies, Owen? You haven't been in Kansas any longer than I have. Elizabeth. Let's not argue. You are wrong and someday you will realize it. I hope so. You know. I came to Kansas to join a crusade. I didn't expect to fall in love. Neither did I. I won't stop seeing you unless you tell me to. Are you going to tell me to? I can't. Alright. Alright. Every one of you knows how important tonight is going to be. It is our responsibility to see that Kansas joins The Union as a slave state. We'll prove to northern politicians that they cannot take away our birthright. Our right to raise our crops and to care for our negroes and their families .. As we have done for as long as America has existed. We reach Lawrence shortly after dark. Pace your horses so they will be fresh when we arrive. Any questions? - Yeah. Why don't we ride to the Browns and take care of that abolitionist camp first? We'll get to them soon enough. Right now they will be expecting us. But the Free-Staters in Lawrence won't. We'll teach them a lesson they won't forget. No. Father. Father! Miss Clark. Holy Father. Thou preparest the table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil. My cup runneth over. Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. And I shall dwell in the house of The Lord forever. Amen. Well, that sure smells good. Let's hope it tastes good. You did alright, Jay. It's every bit as good as what mother makes. If you like it for breakfast. What's troubling you, John? You are not eating. I'm just not hungry, father. We need our strength, all of us. You must try. Green. See who it is. Who is it? It's me, Kruger. I've got to talk to Captain Brown. Over there, Mr Kruger. By the fire. - Yeah. Elizabeth. What's happened? My father. He's dead. Kruger, what is it? Lawrence, Captain Brown. Lawrence is burning. Burning. They rode up and down the streets, shooting and burning. Not a building is undamaged. Is anybody besides the girl's father killed? Five were killed. Many others seriously hurt. The enemy has sacked and burned Lawrence. The war has begun. What does he mean, "the war has begun"? This isn't a war. Five lives were taken tonight. Five innocent people have died. Listen to me now. Everyone. Here are my instructions. Be prepared for an attack at any hour. Salmon, you will be in charge while I am away. Wilson, have your wife look after Miss Clark. I want preparations made for our friends who will be coming from Lawrence. Where are you going, Captain? Where The Lord sends me, my friend. I wish my sons to accompany me. Henry Thompson and you, Mr Kruger. You will come also. Bring provisions. We leave within the hour. They are the ones I actually saw, Captain. There were a lot more. But I can't identify these men. Martin White. Martin White, of course. Doyle and his two sons. Wilkinson. Sherman. Langley. Johnson. I know these men. We leave at once. Where are we going, Captain? Several places. You all have your guns? Saddle up at once. John. Frederick. You heard what I said. Who is it? What do you want? - Inside! Take him. What are you doing? Jason, Frederick. No, not my boy. Don't take my boy. Mummy. Behold, God is mighty in strength and wisdom. He preserveth not the life of the wicked. If they obey Him not, they shall perish by the sword. Thou hast fulfilled the judgement of the wicked. And the justice of God has taken hold of thee. Brown. Brown, please. Strike. Strike the blow of The Lord. [ Gunshot! ] After him! [ Gunshots! ] We got him, Captain. An eye for an eye, my sons. Five people perished at Lawrence. Five of the guilty will perish today. Those men, father. How do you know they were guilty of anything? They were seen at Lawrence. Wilkinson. Sherman. Their names are next on the list. Get to your horses. Quick. Alright. Time to get started. Let's move. What does this mean? The news of what you did is all over Kansas, father. There are bound to be reprisals. We've got a lot of women and children here, Captain Brown. How can you think of leaving Pottawatomie? We are struggling to make this place a stronghold of freedom in Kansas. Will you desert that task now? This is where the votes will be. The votes that will set Kansas a free state. Captain Brown, sir. Us men are willing to fight. If only we could find some place where the women and children could be safe. Where can they be safer than at your back? We. You and I, have planted the seeds of freedom .. Here in this place. And here they will remain and flourish. With God's help. Back to your tents. Alright. Let's get the wagons turned. And get the tents back up. Salmon. They listen to him and obey him. Even though they know he is a murderer. Elizabeth. - He is a murderer. He has made you one too. Jason. John. Where are you going? We are turning ourselves over to the Union Army. Are you insane? I think John is. I want to see him get medical treatment. I don't know any other way to do it. They will imprison you both. We are not fighting the United States Army, father. Not yet anyway. I'm going too. Frederick, listen. - No. I've got to get away from him. After this morning. Tell him, Owen. Goodbye, Salmon. Oliver. You are not going to the army too are you, Frederick? No. I will be around here somewhere I guess. I just want to be alone for a while. Owen. I'd never have come if I thought he'd make us do the things we did today. Maybe. Maybe I wouldn't have come either. But I did. We all did. Everybody in Kansas knows we're here. Three of John Brown's sons have left him and if .. If the rest of us go, why the whole Free-State movement might fall apart. It's falling apart anyway. People around here are about ready to give up. No, I don't think so. Even if they were, father won't give up. Not if there is any kind of a chance. We can't let him fight alone. Make him quit the killing. Owen, talk to him, will you. Yes? Father, I would like to talk to you. Very well, Owen. Frederick has gone too. Is that all you wish to talk to me about? No, father. We came here because we believe as you do. We've even have been willing to fight if we had to. But what we did this morning .. That was wrong. It is I who will decide what is wrong. Not you. How dare you question my orders. Father, listen to me. I am not defying you. I only think you are beginning to lose sight of something. You are so caught up in your dream of trying to make all men free .. That you think it doesn't matter how you accomplish it. But it does. You can't assume the power of life and death over people. Nobody can. Are you finished? You still don't understand what I am trying to say, do you. I understand weakness and cowardice. Even in my own sons. Good evening. - Evening. Just fixing my supper. There is plenty. Care to join me? We were wondering if you would care to join us, mister. John Brown and his sons slaughtered the Doyle family and 2 others this morning. We are gathering men who will get justice done to the Browns. Want to come with us? No. I'll just stay here. I don't want to hurt anybody. I don't want anything to do with killing. If you are not with us that means you are against us. Who are you? What's your name? My name doesn't matter. I don't want to go with you. Stand up and turn around. Do you hear me? You are one of Brown's sons. You know who I am, don't you? I'm not fighting against you anymore. I'm not fighting against anybody. Where did you find him? A little way downstream from my farm, Captain Brown. Did you see any of the Ruffians around your place last night? No .. I didn't see anybody. Take him away. Captain Brown! Look! Out there, out there! Send the women and children to the woods. Every man get a gun. Take cover behind these wagons. Now. Hey, come on. Get my gun. Over there too. Hold your fire! Fire! Fall back to the woods. Keep firing. Hurry, hurry! Back to the woods. Father .. look out! A serious wound, Mr Brown. What can we do, doctor? That wound must be kept clean. He has to stay quiet. Someone must feed him. No solids. Just broth. A spoonful at a time. You'll come back, doctor? I don't believe so, Mr Brown. It was a risk for me to come here this time. Doctor, you who will come back. I have a family. Goodnight, sir. I'll drive you back to town. Oh Lord. Heed the voice of Thy faithful follower. And stretch out Thy hand in healing to my son. That he may once again stand at my right hand in Thy service. Amen. Amen. Amen. I'll take care of him. It is kind of you, Miss Clark. But I believe that we can do that ourselves. I have worked in hospitals Mr Brown. I will take care of him. I appreciate your kindness but .. - Do you? What do you mean? I know why you don't want me here. I don't approve of you. And you don't approve of me. You're afraid I might influence Owen. Young lady. I intend to influence him if it is possible. And I also intend to nurse him back to health. Miss Clark, I order you to leave. I refuse. You are a sinful and rebellious woman. And God in his wisdom, will not allow your sins to go unpunished. I am prepared to take my chances with The Lord, Mr Brown. And after this, please keep your voice down when you are near the patient. Captain Brown, it looks like they have finished us. They have destroyed every single thing we own. They have not destroyed everything we own. We still have our souls and we still have our votes. Have you forgotten what we are here for? To vote and vote we shall. Now, get back to your work. I need two more men. I'll do it. Owen, you are not strong enough to lift things yet. Yes, I am. I'm even strong enough to lift you. Dinner will get cold. Where were you all morning? - Working. Doing laundry and a few chores while you were napping. I wasn't asleep. I was thinking. What about? You. Owen. I love you. I've been wanting to tell you for days. Owen, please don't. You love me. I know you do. Yes, I love you. What is it? You stand for everything I've always hated. Violence. Bloodshed. You've killed and I love you. I have from the first moment I met you. I can't help it. Don't cry. Don't cry. We'll get married. Owen. Well go away far from here. We'll lead our own lives. There will be no-one else but us. Owen. Do you feel strong enough to travel? What do you mean? We're taking you home, Owen. We've decided to quit. Salmon and I are going straight to the farm. And we're taking you with us. I'm staying with father. Owen. Listen, you've been lying here for some time. You don't know what is going on in Kansas. Rebuilding this place is just so much wasted effort. The pro-slavers get stronger every day. - So are we. They've got enough men now to wipe out this place and everyone in it. You can't do any good now anyway. You are too sick. - He is right, Owen. I'm staying with him just the same. Give my love to mother. And Watson. Goodbye. - Goodbye, Owen. Oliver. Owen. You will not leave. I forbid it. What do you want, to see us all killed? Oliver. - I mean it. What kind of a father are you? You have already driven one of your sons insane and gotten another one killed. How dare you address your father like this. Can't you see? You have failed. Why don't you admit it? Why don't you? Why can't you? We're outnumbered six to one. Every man here is going to die because you are so stubborn. Oliver! Don't .. don't. I'm sorry, Pa. Please forgive me. Goodbye, father. Goodbye, father. He should have been back this morning. The polls closed last night. I know father. He won't come back until he is sure his victory is won. His victory? You make it sound as if the only reason Kansas might come in as a free state .. Is because of John Brown. How many ballots against slavery do you think would have been cast .. If father hadn't kept us all right here in Kansas? Well it's all over now one way or the other, so .. Let's not argue. Oh, you are right. Let's not. Let's get married. We can't, Owen. Not until we have decided some very important things. What could be more important than things like this? You know what I mean. If we are going to live the rest of our lives together, it can't be this way. It won't. We're finished in Kansas. The job has been done. Whether successfully or not, we can't change it. Maybe not in Kansas. There are a lot of other places your father can go. We are going home to Ohio. Are you sure, Owen? I'm sure. I'm a farmer, Elizabeth. A good one. And I've never really wanted to be anything else. Alright, Owen. I would be glad and proud to be a farmer's wife. There he is. He'd be riding faster than that if he'd won. Come on. Father! We won! The election is over and Kansas is free. Was it worth it, my son? - It was worth it, father. Our job is done. Father. Elizabeth and I are going to be married. And then we are going home. Very well. My blessings on you both. Thank you, father. Thank you, Mr Brown. I will be with you again in God's time. Lord, we thank Thee for providing us with warmth and food. We thank Thee also for returning two of our sons. For restoring to health our eldest son John. And for enabling us all to be gathered here together. Under thine eyes once again. And we beseech Thee. To receive under Thy bosom our beloved Frederick. Whom Thou in Thy divine wisdom has seen fit .. To remove from our midst. Blessed be Thy name. Forever, Amen. Amen. Here you are, Watson. You need it. The baby of the family is still growing. It sure is wonderful soup, mother. This is the way it should always be, John. All of us together like this. If God wills it, we shall be together like this from time to time. But it cannot be permanent until our work is finished. John. As long as a single human being .. Is in bondage in this land, we cannot rest. I ask, father. Why should we sacrifice our lives? There are plenty of others. Because The Lord has appointed us to that task. Not me, father. I couldn't live through another sickness. John, please. This is the first time we've been together in almost two years. Can't you least wait until supper is finished? The subject has been put aside too long as it is, Mary. So that our sons may know, I will tell them what must be done. First we must visit Boston, Providence, New Bedford. Perhaps two score cities in all. And obtain funds from those who believe as we do. And there are thousands of them. When we have enough, then we shall strike. Where will that be, father? Some place where we cannot fail. I doubt there is such a place, father. As you feel that way, I take it you will not follow me? The army let John and me go on our promise we'd never follow you again. That eliminates Jason and John. Salmon? Not me, father. Wherever you go, there's got to be more fighting and more killing. But not for me. I'm through. That's enough, Salmon. Oliver? I'll go with you, father. Wherever you say. You believe as I do now? Good. It's not just that. I keep thinking of Frederick. I'm going to make them pay for that and keep paying. That goes for me too. Every word. Watson? No. Yes. You are too young. Father, you can't take him. No-one is too young to serve God. Owen. As always, you are at my right hand. I have not yet questioned you. Need I? You don't have to ask me, father. I will stay with you. Elizabeth. Elizabeth. I can't help it. I knew this was going to happen. You will never leave him until you die. Or until he dies. I've never before prayed for a man's death. But I do now. The cause is a good one. I am sure we are all in agreement about that. But, the question occurs, Mr Brown. As to exactly what your intentions are to dispose of the funds you ask. Do you plan an invasion of a slave state perhaps? I am no adventurer, Mr Thoreau. You gentlemen all know my work and are acquainted with my history. You know what I have done in Kansas. I do not expose my plans. No-one knows them. But myself. Except God. I will not be interrogated. If you wish to give me anything I want you to give it freely. I have no other purpose but to serve the cause of liberty. And that gentlemen. Is enough for me. Mr Brown. You may have my draft for $1,000 to do with as you see fit. Mr Emerson? And you will also have mine. Mr Thoreau. Yes. Exactly what I meant. I will need one thousand of them. A thousand? That's enough for an army. There is your money. I want them as soon as they are finished. Thank you, Mr Smith. Label the boxes "farm machinery" and put the name Isaac Smith on them. Where will I send them? Harpers Ferry, Virginia. Wilson, Thompson. Over here. Owen. Yes? Owen, I don't mean to nag. And I know you are busy but .. - I can't tell you anything. Not yet. Darling, I understand how important your father's work is to you. And I came here with you knowing that. But this time it is different. This time you haven't spoken a word to me about it. Is this secrecy because what your father plans to do is so dangerous and wrong? It's not wrong. And it won't be much longer. Owen. Owen, I am your wife. I love you. I've a right to know if you re doing something that may be harmful. It won't do you any good to find out now. You will find out eventually. The whole world will. And at the schoolhouse with all the guns and pikes will be my son Owen. And Wilson and Green. I only hope you have enough arms to equip all the slaves .. Who will be joining us the minute they know what we are doing at Harpers Ferry. I think we will, father. We can arm about 1,300 men. If we can't start a war with that many we might as well forget the whole thing. Remember. Three of you must not leave the schoolhouse under any circumstances. You will be busy enough arming the slaves without worrying about us. You must stay and wait there until the slaves arrive. It may take. 24 hours, even longer, for the news to spread to Virginia and The Carolinas. Can we hold out for 24 hours? - Of course we can. We'll get the arsenal and the fire-house and most important of all, the hostages. They must not be harmed. We well use them to trade for our terms. Alright, gentlemen. It is time. Our cause is just, Mary. We will succeed. Take care, John. Watson, my baby. Be careful. Now you know. I think I always knew it would end this way. You are mistaken, Elizabeth. It is not an end, it is a beginning. The beginning for the entire human race. Do you believe that? - Yes, I believe it. Then we are finished, Owen. Elizabeth. - I mean it. If you leave me now I won't be here when you come back. Owen. It is time. I love you, Elizabeth. I always will. Goodbye. My dear. I thought I could stop him. I didn't mean what I said. He knows that, I'm sure. [ Train horn. Loud. ] What are you doing here? I am here to take possession of the United States arsenal. If the citizens interfere with me. I must burn the town and have blood. Who are you? My name is John Brown. I have come from Kansas to free all the slaves in this state. John Brown. I don't need to be freed by you. I've been free eight years. I'll tell them you're here. Watson. You and two others wait for the train. Bring the fireman and engineer to me as planned. Make no sound and you will not be harmed. Give me the keys. Which key? Are these the only keys to the arsenal? Colonel Washington has the only other set. Thompson, take Calley with you and bring Colonel Washington to the fire-house. Isn't this a better place to hold up than the fire-house? Not with that powder inside. From the fire-house we can control the arsenal. Now. Half of you bring guns and ammunition to the fire-house. The rest of you come with me. Since you men refuse to give your word not to escape, you will be under guard. In a few minutes you train-men will be allowed to leave with your train. When you reach Baltimore you may tell the world what we are doing here. No-one will know until then. Because we have destroyed the town's telegraph. Father, Calley and Thompson. They got some more prisoners. Captain Brown. May I present Colonel Lewis Washington. Colonel Washington. Captain John Brown of Kansas. Brown. This is treason. High treason against the government of the United States Of America. You will be hanged for this. Perhaps. If so, it will be a hanging that this country and the world will never forget. If I die violently, sir. It will be for the freedom of all men. You are wrong. You will hang like any other common traitor. And I pray to God I live to see it. Words like that won't make you live any longer. You are my prisoner, Colonel Washington. I want your word. Not to attempt an escape. You'll get no such promise from me. Put these men with the other hostages. Get on. You train-men can leave now. Watson, let them out. Mayor Beckham. Mayor Beckham. Mayor Beckham. What is the matter? Some raiders have captured the arsenal and the fire-station. They say they came to free the slaves. - What? They have already taken hostages. Hurry up, get your gun. That's not all, Colonel Lee. Brown says they came to free the slaves and intend to do it at all hazards. He says this is the last train that will pass the bridge either east or west. Telegraph wires are cut on either side of Harpers Ferry. This is the first station the engineer could send a despatch from. Eighteen men against the nation? Alright, Lieutenant. When you take your positions, keep those windows covered. Don't fire unless they start something. They are not going anywhere. Hud. Hud. They are trying to surround us. In fact they are getting ready to fight. Watson, Stevens. I want you to go out on the street with a flag of truce. Find whoever is in charge. It is probably the mayor. Tell him I want no bloodshed. Tell him I will meet him anywhere. To discuss the liberation of the slaves in this state .. In return for the lives of the hostages I hold. Watson! I'll take care of him, Captain brown. Father. How is he? Not so good. Do you think something has happened to the slaves? They'll be here, my son. I don't expect them until tomorrow morning. Get back to your post. Mr Owen. I don't believe any colored folks are coming. Not at all. Neither do I. You don't know what you are talking about. Either of you. I know, Mr Owen. They'll come. They've got to. Well, I am not waiting around to find out. I am leaving before they find us here. And if you two have got any sense you will do the same. Do what you want. How about you, Green? I know it is no use. But I believe I will stay with Mr Owen. Goodbye, Mr Wilson. Good luck. Father must be alright. Or they would have given up by now. I wonder how the boys are. Ollie. Ollie. Did you see anything at the schoolhouse? No, sir .. nothing. Father. Frederick. And now Watson. Can it be that The Lord has forsaken me? Brown. You should thank The Lord. At least your dead sons won't hang. No, Oliver. [ Gunshot! ] [ Gunshot! ] Lord. I beseech Thee to take unto Thee. The young souls of two more of my sons. Keep them at Thy right hand. As I have kept them at mine in Thy service. On the bodies of my dead sons I swear unto Thee: Oh God, I will go on. Thy will be done. And all men shall be free. Forward, march! What do they look like to you? - Just what they are, Mr Owen. Soldiers. I'm going down to help my father. - No, Mr Owen. You can't help him now. Nobody can. I got to. - Mr Owen. The only people we can help now is ourselves. We got to leave. Maybe some other time we can .. Right now it's finished. Your father is finished. And so is his dream of freedom. What do we do, Captain Brown? They are coming to bargain with us. Lieutenant Stuart, sir. I have a communication here for the leader of this party .. From Lieutenant Colonel Robert E Lee of the United States Army. I am John Brown, their leader. You may tell Colonel Lee I am willing to exchange the hostages I hold .. For the lives of myself and my men. And the liberation of slaves in this State. "Colonel Lee, United States Army." "Sent here by the President of the United States .." "To suppress the insurrection at this place." "Demands the surrender of the persons in the fire-station." "If they will peaceably surrender .." "They will be kept in safety to await the orders of the President." Lieutenant. "Colonel Lee represents to them in all frankness." "That it is impossible for them to escape." "If he is compelled to take them by force he can't answer for their safety." "Signed, Robert E Lee." You may thank Colonel Lee for his communication. And deliver these terms to him. There are no terms, Mr Brown. Either you surrender or you will be taken. You have exactly two minutes. He refuses to surrender, sir. Now! Now! Fight. Now! He's dead? No, sir. Then he will die on the gallows, Lieutenant. You can be sure of that. See that these people are taken to their homes. Yes, sir. The charges against the defendant. Are treason. Conspiring with slaves and others to rebel. And murder in the first degree. If it please the court. I have just received a telegram from the county seat in Akron Ohio. It is addressed to me and my colleagues. And has a vital bearing on my client's case. It reads. "John Brown and several of his family have resided in this county for years." "Insanity is hereditary in the Brown family." Your Honor. I look upon this as a miserable artifice and pretext .. Of those who want to take a different course in regard to me. Insane persons have but little ability to judge of their own sanity. If I am insane. I should think I know more than all the rest of the world but I do not think so. I am perfectly unconscious of insanity. And I reject. So far as I am able. Any attempt to interfere in my behalf on that score. Has the prisoner anything to say .. As to why sentence should not be pronounced upon him? May it please the court. I have but these few more words to say. I believe. That to have interfered as I have done on behalf of God's despised poor. I did no wrong. But right. Now, if it is deemed necessary. That I should forfeit my life for the furtherance of the ends of justice. And mingle my blood with the blood of my children. And with the blood of millions in this slave country. Whose rights have been disregarded by .. Wicked, cruel and unjust enactments. I say. Let it be done. This court hereby pronounces the sentence of death upon John Brown. To be carried out on Friday. The second day of December. In the year of Our Lord. 0ne thousand, eight hundred and fifty-nine. The prisoner shall be hanged by the neck. Until dead. Dead. Dead. Nobody knows I was with you at Harpers Ferry. I'm free to go and do as I please. Father, this can't fail. I'll let you know the date and time when we've worked out a plan more carefully. I contacted every influential leader of the abolitionist movement in the north. And they are all behind you. They have even promised me men in arms. They will never hang you. No, Owen. But I am grateful. That there are so many in this country to whom John Brown is neither lunatic .. Fanatic, nor murderer. You won't let us help you? No. I am now quite certain that I am worth inconceivably more to hang .. Than for any other purpose. (Ro_s)
