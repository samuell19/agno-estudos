This tale was cobbled together almost at random and hardly merits praise. But no matter. The dowser's rod continues to quiver over the waters hidden below... Our tale takes place during a severe winter, with frosts as keen as Christendom of the time. On such days it's better to roost by the fire and remember tales of old, tales of foolish deeds scattered at random. Why even listen? Is there any sense in them? Why were they written? Tales told by chance, at random, for poetry's sake, at the behest of a wandering echo, and because even the most ancient things lie in the web of present time...

PART I - STRABA How two of the Kozlík brothers went hunting on the imperial highway, and how their neighbor, who helped himself to their spoils, was only saved from death by a holy vision. I've never been here before. - Reiner? - Yes, Your Grace. Ask him how far to Boleslav. Yes, sir. Hey, you with one arm. How far to Boleslav? Bunzlau! How far? You hear me? Boleslav! Bunzlau! Is it far? How far? He's a simpleton, Your Grace. He doesn't understand. Here, you poor wretch. Take it. Go on! He won't take it. The idiot doesn't know what money is. He's too stupid to understand. Your Grace, don't even show money to a scoundrel like that. - You treat the poor wretch like - - I know! Like he's a criminal. Damn it! This cold gets into your bones. Look at him. He's nearly naked. Tell him to climb up on the wagon. He doesn't understand. Wait a minute. - Stop. - Why are we stopping? - The one-armed man! - What's going on? - They stole a horse! - They attacked Heinrich! - Guard the young lord. - Yes, Your Grace. Reiner, wait! - Is he alive? - I don't know, Your Grace. - Stay here with my father. - Christian! Dear God! Heinrich! What's going on? Christian, come back! Look out! He thought he'd get away! Only caught one hare all day- a German one! See that mare? She's something, eh? They're counts from Saxony, but this one speaks Czech. He's the old man's footman. If we don't get rid of them, we can expect a good chase. Tie him up. Stop, you mangy beast! Greetings, Lord Lazar! Greetings, my boy. The poor beast's leg is bad. Beast... I took part of a harness. We're always short. You know these rascals of mine. We were passing by, and they wondered, "What's going on there? Surely not... some misfortune?" The busybodies always have to see for themselves. I said we had to go on, but would they listen? Shut up! Pray. Lord... Almighty God... blessed be your name forever, for you instill hope when misfortune looms. You shatter souls like a potter, then mold them anew, for there is mercy in the depths of your anger. You have permitted my sins... but do not allow your servant Mikoláš to commit a mortal sin. Remember my daughter Marketa, and deliver me from evil. For without me she will fall prey to impure worldly power. Of Kozlík, lord of Roháček, who had eight sons and nine daughters, and of what came about on account of the captive chosen to become bishop of Hennau. Jan! Put the mare in the stable. I don't need the stallion. I'm almost out of oats. Slaughter it. Mikoláš. Alexandra. Adam, give me back that chain. Who is he? Who is he? Tell me. Who is this Lord Lazar? A scavenger! A mangy dog! Thieving vermin! Good Lord, what were you thinking? To let some idiot fleece you on the highway! Nobody fleeced me. He came and went, took a few straps - "Came and went"? Why did you let him get away? Why didn't you just kill the thieving scum without a prayer! Without a prayer! He had no weapon. Like those other two? Did they have no weapons either? We can demand ransom. You half-wit! Will you go claim it? Or will you invite his relatives from Saxony here to Roháček. They must go! Both of them! Now! See, brother? If his father hadn't gotten away, you could have gotten them all at once. What's that? Who got away? Come with me. Come with me! And you get lost. Why didn't you tell me that? Why, you - So they got away. No one's ever gotten away from you before. You stupid dog! Why, I'll - You know what you've done? Look. Have a look. You see? What? You said they had to go. It's all frozen over out there. Frozen solid. If someone wanted to get at us, they could come... for example... through that window - Adam! Stop. - But you said - - Do as I ordered. How Kozlík fared in Boleslav with the captain of the royal regiment, a former merchant who had brewed with hops and for that reason was nicknamed "Beer." ...catching flies... I'll get you. The beasts gave you a good chase, eh? My son... The tawny one - see him, Jan? That's right, stare. You're as tawny as him. We'll all have to take - to our heels. - What's that? Why? Take the hired hands and retrace my steps. I left my knife and hat out there. When will you get some sense into that head of yours? It's like an icicle! Something to drink! Couldn't Jan have gone to Boleslav? You act like you're 50! Have them wake up Mikoláš. So they took your horse. The captain... Where's the captain? Where's that good master of yours? - What do you want with him? - Your lord! The man is of noble birth, Sovička, but he steals. I come in good faith. You must be joking. You shed blood. Kozlík... you'll come to a bad end. Don't threaten me. Here. Drink. "I've come to talk." Too late. The royal patience has run out. Since when has the king worried about poor yeomen? Doesn't he have greater worries? Even a king, however mighty, must swat the flies away. And you want to catch those flies, Captain? I'm glad... my regiment doesn't have to chase you down in the woods. Guards! You show off in vain... peddler! Dear God. Old crone. Why are you always fighting with the captain? I couldn't find... I couldn't find... the chink... in his armor. God's will... wasn't with me. Concerning the visit to the neighbor at Obořiště and what Lazar's daughter learned. Where is your master... wise people? Come out, Lazar. Greet your guest. Or shall I help you, you fox? Shush, you. Welcome to Obořiště. Welcome, my boy. Hurry up. Things look bad. The royal captain has left Boleslav. I see. But if we lie in wait for him together, as my father suggests, near the place - Why me? Near the place where I spared your life! The king has no business with me. I don't kill or steal. Did you inherit this fur? The king knows about you, you highwayman. Dear God! - If his soldiers get you - - I'll buy my way out! If the Lord wills it! But don't count on royal mercy! The king is a just man. But those who ambush his regiment will hang by the roadside. Gracious God, Mary, and Jesus! If you are indeed omnipotent, show your power at Obořiště... and make my father change. Make him change... Knave! Get him, boys! Thieving bastard! Stop! That's enough! I said enough! Leave him alone! Leave him alone, you bastards! You're making a mistake! Don't you know Kozlík has more sons than sheep? Bastards! Oh, God, Marketa! He's just a scoundrel. I'd be none the richer for killing him. Let him be. Let him go. Let him crawl off and die, "if the Lord wills it." He opposes the king. He's a pagan who never utters an honest word. Out of my way, you ass! Marketa. Marketa, do you hear me? I hope you didn't believe him. I've never spilled a drop of blood in my life... except perhaps in self-defense. To take what the wealthy man discards... who isn't weak that way? The upright are allowed to trespass seven times a day, as the good Lord says. And here on earth... what you don't take, you don't have. Don't go thinking God-knows-what. God's love is even greater... than his holy justice. Learn to forgive, Marketa. Learn to forgive. And beseech the Almighty to forgive us. God will not turn a deaf ear to her who's been promised to him. He will not refuse you. Not you. Of Kozlík's retreat from Roháček, and of the designs of his sons and of his daughter Alexandra. Good God! Get the horse. My God, how they bloodied him! What is it? Get that horse! - Lazar scum! - Kill them all! - Off with their heads! - Father! Lazar will pay for this. Don't concern yourself with what others owe. He went up against them alone! Christian. Move it! Lazar's dogs are scared of their own farts! - Alexandra! - For God's sake, be quiet! Alexandra! Quit your yapping, dogs! Don't summon the grim reaper! To the wagons, all of you! Hitch up, you idiots! You'll fall right into the captain's hands. Lazar's place is on his way. But by the time Beer gets there - Adam! - He'll never find Obořiště! - Get down here! Asses! Where did you see the regiment? Half a day. "Half a day" what? - In deep snow. - Spit it out. Maybe even a day away. It won't be good if the captain settles in Obořiště. Seven of you - no more! That's quite enough for that Obořiště scum! And I want Lazar alive! You hear me? Alive! And spare the horses! Well, mutton-head? Did you at least kill one of them? I expected better of you. Why are you still here? Get me a horse. Move it! Come on! Look. Did you really not kill a soul? Well? Leave it to us. Stay out of this. I want them to go with us. Concerning the campaign that turned into a funeral, and how the captain reflected on the senseless death of his aide Sovička, killed at the willful hands of Kozlík's sons at Obořiště and buried at Roháček. Stay out of the courtyard. I just want to feed the birds. I said to stay out of the courtyard. Have you lost your mind? Half that much meat would do. And all those spices! Dear God... what have I done? They'll empty the grain store, there's nothing in the larder, and spring is far off. In league with Kozlík now? You never wanted that. What do you mean, in league with Kozlík? Drive the devil out the gate and a demon slips in the keyhole. It's cold out there! - What bitter cold! - The road will be firm. Firm as a barn floor. Something smells good. - Arnica? - Coltsfoot and butterbur. The marshes leading to Roháček are frozen over. Butterbur heals wounds. I know... Miss Marketa. Aren't you leaving in the morning? Don't worry, sir. I won't leave your lovely little nest exposed. Mind that those other little birdies don't fly from your clutches. The king's law reaches further than Kozlík can run. I come from a good line, Lord Lazar. I know what my coat of arms commands. Not so fast, my friend. Your property and your daughter are under my protection. Woe to him who - My dear Sovička. Does it hurt? Your hand is blessed, my child. Captain... - such healers are rare. - Praised be the Lord. - No, not a healer-an angel! - Who marked you? The angel of mercy. You mustn't say that. Forgive me. A sincere mind need not seek for words. It seems a bird's breast weighs heavily on the knight's valiant heart. As long as a bit of his heart remains for when I signal the attack. It's high time for that, Captain. Well, well! I see you mean business... my little marshal. Your advice never was worth shit. What advice does one give a peddler? A farmer's son! You lead your regiment like cattle from one stable to another - some hero! The king demands law and order, not heroism, and it's to me that he entrusted the captain's mace. I travel the land with no coat of arms, waging a merchant's war... while your tirades land you in the mortuary. Nobles! One babbles, another murders, and a third - What did Kozlík's men want anyway? To buy my horses. So you've switched to stealing horses now? You do me an injustice. I don't even have enough straw for my own geldings until spring. You'd begrudge us a few oats - likely stolen anyway? Of course not. Royal protection isn't free. Some have even starved on account of it. You'll make up for it, you old fox. We know your ways. That's all just gossip, Captain. Fine. Just be sure you don't end up like your neighbor. Catch him! Kill him! The gates! Close the gates! Stop staring... and go to bed. We didn't come a-courting. Roháček is empty Captain. - The birdies flew the coop! - Shall we follow the trail? It's still fresh. Haste, my fellow... is never a wise counselor. Jesus, why do you punish me? So many people! Horses. Seven of them. Dear God, where will we put them all? Seven men won't be much help! Where will we put them all? Out of the frying pan... Some reinforcements! They have no provisions. You reproached me for being foolish and imprudent. Now you're waiting for reinforcements? You count horsemen like you count your coins. An astute observation, Sovička. Astute indeed. Wait, that doesn't look like - Those aren't - Cornet! Those aren't - The king entrusted me with his soldiers and horsemen... - Your blood's frozen in your veins! - And I look after them. Halt! Fear's got the best of you! Halt, you damned fool! Dear God, you see this fool? Wouldn't even put on a fur! So you've brought your stench here too, Captain? Looking for silver, peddler? Shut up, you mangy dogs! - Go to the devil! - But leave Lazar here! We're here to light his way! Devious polecats! Stay away from Roháček! Or we'll chop your member off! Just try it, you swine! We'll make a gelding of you! Come out, you bastards! Show yourselves! We've had enough of watching you! You bloated pumpkin of a peddler! I'll find you all and shove you on stakes! I swear I'll impale every one of you! I'll slaughter you like cattle, without mercy... and scatter your parts in the woods... fuckers! - Obnoxious ass! - Fuckers! Sons of bitches! God teaches us that retribution will not brook delay. No soldier shall rest, nor beast, nor arms. I shall hunt them down like I've never hunted anyone. And if they're killed in the process... I'll take their children! How Lazar, rid of his worries with his neighbors - whom the captain pursues through the woods - gave his daughter away without a dowry. Lord Lazar... His reason has been dulled. His speech is muddled, Your Grace. He brays and brays like a donkey. God has also given you a fair daughter. I know... but a fool for an heir. You blaspheme. I'm giving you what is most dear to me. She's been looking forward to living here. She said farewell to all at home. "Long yearning, great joy." - Her wait is over. - I know, Your Grace. Easter will be here soon. I too donned a novice's robe before Our Lord's resurrection. About those sheep... don't hold it against me, but it's been a hard year. First the soldiers came, and you know about my neighbor. Obořiště isn't much. Farmers who were unaffected are richer now. God knows I don't intend to short you on Marketa's dowry. Her chest is full, and there's even some money, but I lost much of my livestock. We are not your confessors. Your Grace. You will return before the last snow melts. Come, child. I'll bring the sheep too, if the convent will be patient. As the good Lord is above me. The just Lord. The all-knowing Lord. The Lord be with you, noble sir. May your house be filled with health and happiness and all other good things. May your oxen thrive. Spare a coin from your purse for the Lord's sake. If you have anything to give - You hear that vagabond? - My feet are frozen stiff. - My dear sir! Monks and nuns used to preach poverty, but now? You hear him? - Now they take and take. - Why are you bitter? There will be no children to carry on the line. It was you who promised me to the church. It will be sad without you. What have we here? With a bit of work it will be fine. The Lord taketh away, and the Lord giveth. The Lord will not abandon a righteous man. Look at her. She's a nun! Slow down, little one. Praise to the Lord. A thaw... is coming. By the mercy of God... Boys... Boys... don't act like beasts. What are you seeking revenge for? Mikoláš... do not sin because of us. Remember the Lord. Lord... have mercy on these poor fools. I'll never forget this, Mikoláš. Never. Adam. Christ! Have mercy! Enough. We're at your mercy and cannot protect ourselves, but do not commit murder. Mikoláš... do not commit murder. Do not commit murder! I'll pay. With what? No! For God's sake, no! Take what you want, but don't harm Marketa! Don't be an animal! She's been promised to God. The Lord enabled me to settle accounts, Lazar. We're even. But since you're such a reasonable man... and willing to be my creditor, grant us this virgin. The good Lord, who stands as an example to you, will be happy to share her! You can't do this! Get up. Go on. Straba is thirsty for blood. Guard the palisade. Leave no gap in the stakes. Why is he crying? He's mocking others... and himself. They threw his mother to the wolves. He grew up a human among wolves and a wolf among humans. Contempt feeds his pride. Lack of love infuses him with hatred. Scorned by all, Straba scorns them all in turn. He sneers at the elders and disgraces the sacred ancestral sites. He will not bow before men or gods. He's free like a wolf, like an animal in the woods, but he still has a human heart... and a human heart is full of sorrow. Sorrow... When he came of age, those whose word is law would have him cast out. What happened to him? He listened to the men's decision... and laughed... the quiet laugh of a wolf. He was handsome. He went where the maidens gathered and chose the most beautiful. She feared him, but she feared her father even more. It's your father who decides to whom you will submit. Straba cried out in pride and rage and spilled the blood from her throat before all. They pounced on him and put him in chains. A horrible punishment awaited him. The men deliberated. "Burn him at the stake," said one. "Let stallions drag him," said another. They couldn't agree on how to kill him. Then the eldest, great-grandfather of the one violated, pronounced his sentence. "Let him have no place among humans. Let him be free as a wolf. He carries his punishment within himself." At these words Perun cast down lightning, but there were no clouds. What did Straba do? He laughed... the quiet laugh of a wolf. He left... baring his teeth with that quiet laugh. He pilfered cattle and women. Arrows had no power over him. He was free as a wolf. His life was not measured by the solstices. Yet he was alone. Delight passed him by, as it had not been paid for by suffering. Life has no value without pain. So he began to long for pain and seek death. He returned to those who had cast him out. But many winters had passed, and even the grandsons from before were now old men. They knew of him only from ancient tales. The young men came at him with weapons. One remembered, shouting, "Stay away from him! He has come for death, but we shall deny it to him!" They all fell back and mocked him. He had returned to die, yet death was denied him. Their mockery burned him like flame. He trembled like an aspen tree. He groped for the heart in his breast, seized the nearest knife, and plunged it in. But the knife broke, and no blood was drawn. He was alone again. Does he weep? No. Weeping is the gift of relief. Men do not know it. Their pride is met with eternal punishment. Straba is of their line. His great-grandfather came from the woman Straba took. Shut up! You old crone. Don't summon evil. All of you bear the mark of his blood. But the curse cannot touch the seventh son. What are you doing? Why is there no guard? The captain has crossed the ford. - Look! - Where? A fine mess! Where are you supposed to be? Are you on watch here? Where did that whore come from? Put the nail shoes on her. She can go to hell! I wanted Lazar. Why didn't you bring him to me? Why? You dishonor yourself, Lord Kozlík! Act with chivalry! I beseech you: Do not torment a defenseless girl. Go on. I offer you my inheritance - - Alexandra! - Let me go! Let me go! What are you doing? Fools! Shut up! Bitches! The chains! Bring the chains! PART I'll - THE LAMB OF GOD. Spring drew a good bit closer that day. Shepherds and wayfarers spoke of how spring's voice was growing louder. Indeed, one could hear the wind horns played by the sun angels. Who would think now of a maiden's tale of woe? Who would heed the crazed foolishness of scoundrels? The Lord, returning to the welcoming lowlands, fixes his mild gaze on the simplicity of those who rejoice in him. What's that you're singing? What are you muttering? A prayer. That's no prayer, and no song either. It's a sermon. I don't know, Father. Are you not living in sodomitical sin? You know she is no woman, just as you are no ram. You know there is no fooling God. If only your voice were as good as your simplicity is great. Look. You see, little one? The Lord is showing us the way. We'll have a bowl of milk and a nice warm nook. Perhaps even a nice red apple from the granary. Come on. Don't just stand there. We're just in time. Come. Could it be a christening? Or perhaps a wedding? In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, Our Holy Mother blesses you, lads, and Christ's holy intercessors raise their hands that your sins may be forgiven. The priest's prayers rise up to the clouds. You live like princes here. Yes, indeed. Step back a bit. The Lord be with you, noble sirs. May your house be filled with health and happiness and all other good things. First, my lords - What is it, little one? First of all, may your oxen thrive. Spare a coin from your purse for the Lord's sake. If you have anything to give, don't leave me with nothing. My feet are frozen stiff. I don't understand a word, good fellow, but you have a nice lamb. That's no lamb but a sheep sent to me by a higher will. But I see you were once among our flock. You slipped away, my brother, didn't you? - Out of the frying pan - - What of it? St. George is a just patron. Wait just a minute. Where's the master? You're out of luck, my friend. The groom nailed him to the gate like a bat. And dragged the sheep off on a rope. What are you muttering? Only that you came just in time! How Bernard found the soldier who had robbed him, and what became of the jests of Kozlík's boys. Stinking swine! Lord, do not allow - Many bulls have encircled me. Strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round. Bastard dogs have swarmed around me! Keep her safe, O Lord! Dear Lord! Dear Lord, what are their designs? As a wolf fucked a bitch! The mangy dogs! Swept away to the hellish world! Little one! Stand by me, O Lord, and with your sword protect us from their mangy hands. Strike them dumb with terror! Dumb as tree trunks! Amen. Holy Jesus... Where are you, little one? What did you do to her? Did St. George come to your aid after all? Like fuck he did! There will be rejoicing, O Lord, for you have destroyed the wicked. Where's my sheep? Fucker! For the wicked bend their bow and make ready their arrow upon the string. Their mouths are full of cursing, lies, and threats. Your soldiering days are over, my friend. Little one! Dear God! Where are you, little one? Little one! Little wanderer! Where the devil...? Come out! In Christ's name, come out, I say! Foolish beast! Have you no sense? May the werewolf get you! Collect the arrows. A mare! Quiet! Into the bushes. You two get out of here. And you, get out of here, and take the mares. The birdie flew into the trap. Bastard! Run the scoundrel down! You won't get away, fucker! Move it, dumb-ass! Throw it! For Christ's sake, kill him! - The mares! - Stop him! Use your knife! Bastard! You call this a catch? Where are the others? It's not possible! Their carts and provisions? Lord in heaven! Captain! You can all starve, but what will I feed the mares? The one-armed man who killed my son! Stay where you are. Kill him now! - Stay there, Count. - Where is my boy? You swine! Where did you bury him? Will you stay the hell where you are? You won't get away this time, by God! Quiet, Count! And you - stand up! Give me a knife. I'll make him pay! That's him! There's no need for haste. Do you belong to the yeoman they call Kozlík? Is he a mute? Tie him to the saddle. He'll lead us there. Make him pay! Have your dogs tear him to pieces! - Onward! - I order you! What's the meaning of this? That cur has no right to live! What's the meaning of this? Look for quarters further on in the villages. Of the scourge of the chain, and of Mikoláš's memories reawakened by Alexandra's noble beloved, and of the revenge of One-Armed Adam. Drahuše. Come out here. Here. Give these to the falcons, one at a time. Go on. And give the buzzard two. What were you lurking around there for? What are you doing there? Get inside, brat! Go on! Hunting without hounds, brother? Waiting by a mouse hole for game? Take them to the stalls! The horses! You have a grandson, Kozlík. I want him to know we're bound to him by more than chains. Tell him we will share his misfortune and hope it commends us to God. My master would like, if you'll allow him - My master would like... to share his thoughts. He says we will share your misfortune as gallant forbearance demands. We will share your misfortune in hopes that God will one day commend us for it. His blood has been poisoned. The poison entered his body... through an impure deed. God has marked his left arm. Incantations... were of no help. Adam will die, Kozlík. Take him into the yard. And Alexandra too. You will stand there and look into your brother's eyes until he dies. Then you'll be buried with him. If he's saved, you'll be spared too. It will be done as the gods - as God decides. Stop, you bastard! Stop! Stop! Get back, animal! Where has he dragged us? Animal! Stop! Hold him! Mangy swine! Give me that! Not so fast! Save some for the journey! There isn't far to go, Captain. We're nearly at Roháček. Let us have him, Captain! You scum! Captain... that scoundrel is mine! He's mine... to do with as I see fit. Captain... the king gave me a decree, and you're his servant. Stand aside and hand that murderer over! I order you to hand him over! He'll die three times - no, ten times over! He will have no merciful death! Must we beg you, Captain? Concerning the last supper, at which Bernard's sheep meets its end, and of the hour when death assumes power. Who have you dragged here? Clown! Come out here. Come out into God's light! Well, well! Lament, you boars, and repent for your atrocities. Adam has sent us a confessor! Who are you? They took my sheep. - I travel the world... - Quiet! And people give us bread. Who sent you? God. They laugh when I join my voice to that of my sheep. God's wisdom pressed us into the dust of the road, me staggering along, her clip-clopping on her little hooves. Together we wander through the kingdom, and from the beauty of the world we learn of love and the creator. - Let us pray to the Lord. - Wait! Wait a minute. Not so fast. Pour some wine. Drahuše! Where is that brat? Don't just leave him standing there. Your Simon's a lot of use! Did you rub down the horses? They've got plenty of straw. I hope his skull freezes! For the little one, perhaps he could...? Just look after the spit. Father. The spit! - We have an unbaptized child. - God bless you, noble lady! If you are ordained and your soul is absolved, - do not deny us your service. - I'll baptize him. Get me some grain, salt, and holy water... if you have any. Don't you use wine? Not every kind is suitable. Come here. Come here! Have some. Try it. Should I... Drain the jug! To your health. Come, Father. I'll take you. Thank the Lord! That was good! - This way, Father. - Very good! I'll baptize the child now. He likes his drink! You're going to sleep early. The fields at Roháček lie barren, and we're like - - Like the fowls of the air... - Are you hungry? Like the lilies of the field. Like the lamb of God... Drink... my golden-tongued friend. Think of the children. What do you want? Should I give myself up? What will become of them? Mind your own business, old crone! - God acts in mysterious ways. - What will become of them? More wolves. If not for all those helping him, the captain would be either dead or starving by now. Where's he getting provisions? From our neighbor-the vermin! You destroyed his property, and his daughter- He deserved it. And I still owe him some! May God be your judge. You're invoking God now? Against whom? And you - shut up! Against whom? The captain isn't far off. Are you threatening me? Are you threatening me? Think of your salvation. Think of your own, you old witch! Age has dulled our reason. I don't deny my sins. I've been quick to draw my sword, but I've never harmed the defenseless. Hush! My deeds will terrify me at the Last Judgment! I will be afraid, but I will not be ashamed! Yes, I warred with other nobles against the king's will. For ten years he has sent me warnings through his captains and other armed enemies. I answered them as I would any enemy. My sword is no shorter than the captain's. Get up. Farty. Wake up the priest. What a sorry bunch. Little one. Open up. Open up, you fool! I want to talk to Father. Little one. I'm listening. I heard a wolf's call. Wild boar are approaching from the south... and herds of deer. Adam, saddle up the horses. It was a warning, Kozlík. Get up! Sure you're not just scared? Stop! Come back! Come here. Take off their chains. I hope you learned your lesson! Go see to your work. Take some horses to where the stream forks. Don't make a move until I say. Take Jiří with you. No, wait. I'll send him with Mikoláš. Silence! I said silence! God be with you. Hurry up! And let him take the sheep! Lord... why do you constantly try me? My saliva is bitter in my mouth. Whores of Herod! In the name of God and king, yeoman Kozlík, lord of Roháček, our lord and king, heir of this land, giver of laws and guardian of justice, addresses you through me! Open your gate and lay down your arms. Your iniquity has come to an end. Go home, Captain! Go back to Boleslav! My gates are strong, and I've lost the key! In seizing the count's son you have wronged the future bishop of Hennau. The king demands to know what you have done with him. Answer, and give yourself up! Leave the wagons here! Horsemen and foot soldiers up the slope! Listen, Captain... the king is lord over us all. But war is lord over kings. War will be the judge in this dispute. Maybe I will defeat your troops and speak to the king's envoy in Boleslav. Maybe I will be defeated and killed. We don't know what fate awaits us. The victor will prevail. So tear up your decree and let the wind scatter the pieces! Halt! War is declared - and I have no scribe! Prepare to run, you thieving bastards! Thieving bastards! If you do not surrender, you will be destroyed! You will be destroyed... and your family wiped out. Before I storm your palisade... I'll kill one of yours as a warning! That's my prisoner! I'll bring my case to the emperor! To the emperor, I say! What's the emperor to me? Bring him out, boys, and we'll bargain. If you wrong my son, they'll be looking for a new bishop in Hennau! What are you waiting for, Captain? By the Virgin Mother, finish him off! Christian, my son! He's alive! In God's name, stop, Captain! I order you to negotiate with them. Stay back! Goddamn it! Hold him back! I command you - don't you dare! Hands off, you rabble! Kill him, Father! Form a line! My boy! My son! Form a line, damn it! Fall back! What's your haste? Form a line! Goddamn it! Is this what you wanted? You should all be castrated! Idiots! Vermin! Stupid mangy beasts! Stupid oxen! Cornet! Cornet, where are you going? Back, you beasts! Round up your men and beat them over the head! That's what you get! The animals! What's that in your hands? Ladders! Make ladders! Dismount... and make ladders. Take the horses down to the swamps, all of you! I'll show you. Cornet, the ropes! Tie the ropes together to form ladders! I'll show you wretches! I'll show you how to attack! So there you have it... Where love led the bishop of Hennau, and on the soliloquies of madmen. Kill her! Kill her! Murderess! Christian, kill her! Kill the murderess. Murderess! She's a whore! No... she's a witch! She's driven you mad with her magic! Leave her! - She's expecting my child. - Fool! Concubine! My lord... I know you better than your own heart. Be done with this devil woman. What is she to you? Her hair crawls with lice and she stinks! Let her be gone. Let her be gone! Alexandra! They did quite a job on you... the beasts! There's not really enough for two... but have some. Fine. More for me. A pinch of salt would be nice. You wouldn't have any, would you? Such is the way of the world. We defend ourselves like she-bears... and when our back's to the wall, we attack our neighbors like lynxes. What good is it to ask the Lord for help? Did you hear the captain? "With the help of God!" They made that lout a lord! This is all we needed. Get up. Let's go find shelter. I was invited to a lamb dinner once... at a monastery. It was Easter. Whores of Herod! Two blockheads with swords. Driving a poor man away from a beggar's bowl! What was it called? It was the monastery on Turnov Road. You know the one? Suddenly it was full of soldiers, and they made me go hungry. But that captain! The captain, the cornets, the drums! Shit! Bad farmers clear woods, and bad kings start wars. Don't pretend you're so pious. You're all pagans. Hear that? What's that? I went into an inn in Boleslav. There were two huge men there. The bigger one grabs me - What are you gaping at like a fish? What are you gaping at? You hear me? Christ our savior! Holy Virgin! Give him some water. Reminds me of our deceased king. - May he rest in peace. - He may outlive you yet. He means the king, and you're talking about this old goat! He was with us on the Austrian campaign. He was a good neighbor. He didn't rob or steal. When his head was cracked in two, he didn't even dismount. He just slapped some clay on it and rode home. And now the gallows await. Gallows? You mean the ax! What ax? The sword! He was of noble blood. Ax, sword - God help him. On the fate of men and the lot of widows. Lady Kateřina! It's Lord Mikoláš! Izo, your brother! Praise be to God! At least you're here. At least you made it. Come. Rest. We don't have that horse anymore. - It broke its leg. - What about Smil? I never expected - - Any news of Smil? - What about Jiří? - And Burjan? - Did you see my husband? Yes, I did. Eat this. You're fishing? Whatever the flood brings. I could sell some in Boleslav. What are you thinking? We won't get past the gates empty-handed. - Why Boleslav? - Is he alive? They wouldn't have taken him otherwise. I know what Kozlík would order you to do. We'll bring a basket of fish. We'll act like peasants, and we'll charge the prison. He'd tell you to flee the king's wrath and scatter to neighboring villages, and later return to rebuild Roháček. Storm a stone prison? The two of us? A single wolf can defeat a pack of dogs if the timing is right. - We'll storm Boleslav! - Shut up, you! Shut up and fish. We'd need a regiment. Kozlík is dead. Or if not, he'll get the ax. No power can wrest him from death's hands. No power but God's. Then God will guide us. He sinned the sins of a soldier. Allow him to die in peace, for death is the wages for all his sins. You want the executioner to take him? Kozlík is old, Mikoláš, and so am I. We're both waiting for death. But all of you must stay alive... and look after your progeny. Allow the aged a peaceful grave and think of the living. Spring shall pass, and soon we shall sow. Keep along this road. Go on. Return home. I took you from Obořiště against your will. No one has reason to reproach you. Go. Get back in your father's good graces and wait. I look back and see what happened, and I know you're sad. And I know you love me. But we who are left must save Kozlík from dishonor. Your names are written in hell's rolls. Damn all of you! Stop blaspheming. May you never know peace and your bones never find rest! Stop cursing! Don't summon evil! God will hear you, Marketa! Their time had come. Kozlík woke me and said, "Bring the arrows." I followed after him. I couldn't even see the way. They were calling to each other. When their time comes, they seek battle to find a doe. To force their will on her? No, they call to another stag. And the doe? She submits to the strongest. - Forever after? - "Forever after." - Only people think that way. - And the defeated one? He must have picked up our scent, but he didn't move. The Goat wouldn't let me shoot him. Why do you call him that? I always have. I heard it from the hired hands as a boy. He beat me bloody once. What happened then? His antlers were thicker than branches. He gazed at us without fear. Kozlík motioned to me to be quiet. We moved in closer. He moved away, and we followed. At the base of the hill was a bare plain with grass, stones, lichen... more desolate than a graveyard I once saw. Skeletons... bones... a thousand antlers atop white skulls. He stood in the middle... alone... and defeated. Alone. Kozlík whispered... "Look... the solitude of death." He raised his antlers and called. - Who was he calling to battle - - Shh! Just a moment longer. Take Alexandra with you. You have a faraway look in your eyes, and your thoughts rush down the path to punishment. But what about me? We haven't given up yet. I will be judged again and again, even after I've been unjustly punished. Do not speak of punishment, and make plans for our wedding. Wait for a message from me. If need be, my brothers will find you. God made me love you. You are my wife. Just... a moment longer. Welcome. You are... Bitches! Go away! Away! Go away! I said go away! You've come back at a bad time. What are you doing here? - I've come - - He sent you. You could have come back long ago, but you enjoyed wallowing in sin. - You're his concubine. - No! Look. I don't have the stomach to see you reduced to ashes and pus. - I didn't leave of my own will. - Really? Who came to my defense? So you've come not in repentance but in reproach? I've come to receive your judgment. It is written, "Judge not lest you be judged." Ask not to be judged, but pray to God for greater contrition. I haven't yet heard you... renounce him. No... Go! You broke the vow I made to God. Get out! You're not even fit to feed the swine! Go with God, and don't worry. You'll be back. This pain will subside. This torment will pass. - Follow her! - Yes, Your Grace. I'll speak up for you when the time is right. Wait! Dear Lord, no! Why did she - Where did she bury him? What do you want? How dare you! Guards, get her! Kill her! ...for you have been my help. Do not abandon or forsake me, O God of my salvation. Remember not my sins nor my transgressions, but remember me in your mercy. Though my mother and father forsake me, the Lord will receive me. For my iniquities hang over my head. They are too heavy for me. You have made my days a mere handbreadth. The span of my years is as nothing before you. Verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Man is a mere phantom as he goes to and fro. He bustles about in vain. He heaps up riches and knows not who will gather them. Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in my integrity. I have trusted in the Lord. Examine me, O Lord. Test my heart and mind. The troubles of my heart have multiplied. Lead me from my anguish. Teach me your paths. Lead me on a straight path because of my enemies. Do not turn me over to the desire of my foes. For false witnesses rise up against me, breathing out violence. Gather not my soul with sinners... nor my life with the bloodthirsty man... nor my life with the bloodthirsty man... nor my life with the bloodthirsty man... in whose hands are wicked schemes... whose right hand is full of spoils. Reach down your hand from on high. Send forth lightning and let burning coals fall upon them. May they be thrown into the fire... into miry pits... never to rise. Remember your tender mercies, O Lord... Remember your tender mercies... O Lord. And your loving kindnesses, for they have been ever of old. Look upon my affliction and my distress... and be not far from me, O God. For your arrows have pierced me, and your hand has come down upon me. Remove your scourge from me. I am overcome by the blow of your hand. My heart has turned to wax. It has melted away within me. My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth. For you lay me in the dust of death. My wounds fester and are loathsome... because of my sinful folly. O Lord... lead me in your righteousness because of my enemies. Not a word from their mouth can be trusted. Let them fall by their own counsels, but save me for your mercy's sake. For in death there is no remembrance of you. In the grave who shall give you thanks? Reach down your hand from on high. Marketa... daughter of Lazar, do you take Mikoláš, son of Kozlík, to be your one true husband? I do. Mikoláš, son of Kozlík, do you take Marketa, daughter of Lazar? I hereby bind your hands in the sacrament of matrimony. What God has joined, let no man tear asunder. Come. You were my most beloved. What have we here? Praised be the Lord forever. Just in time. Shall we go find greener pastures? Stay still! There was no talking to your father at Obořiště. A sad business. Stay still, little one! I found her starving. But what are you doing here? Come, my dear girl. Let's wander together, the three of us. We'll be fine. The Lord will provide shelter. We'll have a merry winter. What do you say? We'll be fine. Marketa, wait. Little one! Marketa, just a minute. Where are you running off to? Stop! I'll give you the stick! Marketa! Stupid beast! Marketa, wait! Just a minute! Little one, is this my thanks for saving you from the knife? Stop, I say! Mangy beast! If I get my hands on you - Stop! Stop, you smelly goat! Wait, Marketa! In time the girl bore a son, who was named Václav. Alexandra gave birth then too, and Marketa nursed both children. They grew up to be strapping young men, but alas, love fought with cruelty, and certainty with doubt, for their souls.
