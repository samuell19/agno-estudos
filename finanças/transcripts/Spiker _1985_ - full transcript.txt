(horn honking) (chattering) - Oh hi Catch. How you doin'? - Fine, hey can you hold this for me? - Sure. - Hi Catch, where's Sonny? - Your guess is as good as mine. - Hey Sonny's gonna lose his arm in a coyote (mumbles) yet. (gentle music) (hollering) - Sonny! Sonny, there's Sonny! (chattering) - Hey, Sonny, Sonny, Sonny, come here. It's for you. (chattering) - All right! (chattering) Should we tell 'em? - Yeah sure, why not? - Hey listen! - Oh it's a letter, you know somebody who can write, huh? - Absolutely. In this envelope I have news! - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. - Heavy duty news! (chattering) Why don't you read it, huh? - All right, all right. Wait, wait, wait, all right. Dear Mr. Reston, you're not Mr. Reston. All right, you've been selected to participate in try outs for a permanent spot as a member of the United States Men's National Volleyball Team. (cheering) Which is currently training for the Olympic Games. (chattering) - Catch got a letter too, (mumbles) Olympics. Come on you guys. Read Catch's letter. - I don't know, man, I'm not so sure. - Back up about three steps. My shadow, you're on my shadow, it's bad luck. - Oh there we go. Feel better big boy? - So, what are you gonna do? - I don't know, first I couldn't wait for that offer to get here, and now that it's here, I don't know if I want it. - You gotta be crazy. You gotta be nuts to turn down a crack at the Olympics. - Hey, let's say we do it. What if we don't get accepted, I mean, who says we're gonna make the team? - Are you kidding? We're the best, they need us. - Okay, say we do it. You know, we put in the time. What happens if we don't win? You know what happens if we lose, then what? - What do you want, Catch, your whole life laid out like a god damn blue print? Who knows what's gonna happen. Hey. Make you a deal. Heads we go, tails we don't. Come on, you only live once. What do you say? - Flip it. - [Sonny] Heads, we go! - Still beating? - Yeah, listen I saved 12 patients today. You can be my 13th. - That's good, thanks, Sandy. Bet they don't have freshman like you near the patients. - Hey, watch who you're calling a freshman. At least I know which end gets the enema. - God that's classy, you tell that to your patients? - What do ya got, a bunch of bills? - Yup, same as always. God why do banks always give you two? Wait a minute, wait a minute. Hold your horses. Dear Mr. Landow, you've been selected to participate in tryouts for a permanent spot as a member of the United States Men's National Volleyball Olympic Team. All right! - Hey, Steve, are you gonna do this? - Why not? - What, quit medical school, are you nuts? - No man, just postpone. - Steve, you better think about it. - Well, Sandy, I have. - What for the past 20 seconds? - No man, since premed. I knew this might come up and I was just waiting for the opportunity. - You're crazy. - I'm not crazy-- (ambulance horn wailing) - Let's go we got a code! (chattering) - I'm Coach Doames. Join us. - How you doin', I'm Sonny Reston. - Well aren't you glad you're you? Good morning. Practice begins around here at 8:00, 8:00 sharp. It is now 8:07. That'll be seven minutes each on the Russian leaper when practice is over, and that's at 12:00 sharp. Number one, you show up here on time and in proper attire. You in that purple outfit, you can burn it. Nobody, I repeat nobody on this team dresses like a beach bunny. Number two, I will meet each of you personally in my office this afternoon, I don't care if you made all American five years in a row. I care about one thing, and one thing only. The USA Men's Volleyball Team. I do care how you play volleyball, not as an individual, but as a team. I want this team to be the world's best. My job is to see that you reach that goal without making a horse's ass out of yourself in the process. I want you in uniform, taped and ready to play in exactly 11 minutes, so move it. Move it. - I think he likes me. - Oh everyone likes you. - What's a Russian leaper? - I don't know, I hope it's a blonde with big boobs. - 'Kay let's go, line it up we're gonna run some sprints. Come on, let's go, line up. Line it up, ready, go! (upbeat music) Push it, all the way, come on all the way. Let's go, line up. - Newt Steinbech, how are ya? - Catch. - Heard you guys were coming, Newt Steinbech, hi. - Go! All the way through, push it! Let's go all the way through, all the way through. - (mumbles) usually goes to lunch. The Soup Plantation, you guys wanna come? - Sure. - Ready, go! All right, let's push it-- (whistle screeching) - Yo, watch it. - That's pretty nice. - That's Newt's wife, man. That's off limits. He's crazy about her, so leave her alone. Give me that water bottle. Hey Newt, Marcia's here. - I thought you were going shopping today. - Alone, with no money? - Go for lunch or something. Do something. - By myself? - Jesus, Marcia. - [Marcia] What do you want me to do, drag some stranger off the street? - Make some friends. Try. - Easy for you to say, Newt. You got another fan letter today. Dear Newt, I don't know how to ask, but I guess the only way is to be bold. I would like very much to have a drink with you. And for us to get to know each other. Please call, you're the best looking man on the team and I would love to sleep with you. Love, Lisa. - That is a pile of crap, and you know it. - [Man] Newt! - We'll talk later. - [Man] Newt, on the leaper, no blockers. (mumbles) on the jump box. (mumbles) on the vertex. - All right, the rest of you come here. Over here. Now this is our little torture device we stole from the Russians, it's called the Russian leaper. - What's it for? - You'll love it, Sonny, tell him, Bill. - It's gonna help with the stamina in your legs. You'll be able to jump higher (mumbles). - Whatever it takes, Reston, get up. I want you to take a deep breath first. Put your arms up, don't use your arms, just your legs. I want you to jump 20 times. Take a deep breath, just 20 times. Go on. (applause) (chattering) - Get some depth, get some depth, yes. Squat down. Keep your toes point straight ahead. Come on drive it, now drive it let's go. Let's go, come on, some depth, get down. - Come on Newt, show him how to do it. (chattering) (upbeat music) - Fast jumps, high as you can, let's go. - That a boy, that a boy, get some spring. Come on, quicker. Swing it, get more lift off. Lift off. Come on, up. Come on, come on, come on, hold him down there. Well what do we have here? Miss Reston, prima ballerina. Ballet class Reston. Bend your knees, get some spring, come on. - One thing, you get good eats. - You've been here a long time, huh? - I've been here about six years now. I'm the old man of the team. - Was it always this tough? - Yeah, it gets tougher. You gotta really want it. - Oh I want it. I want it. - That's Pam Howard. She hangs out with the team a lot. - What about him, Mr. Friendly. Does he ever smile? - Doames is a tough coach. My advice to you is keep on his good side. Don't hassle him, blend into the woodwork. - Blend in to the wood work? - Anybody want an egg? - [Sonny] Raw egg? Raw oysters, yes, raw eggs? - I'm sure you gentleman can squeeze one more little person in here. Hi, I'm Pam Howard. Welcome to the team. - Sonny Reston. Newt tells me you like to hang around the team a lot. - [Pam] Working on my master's thesis. - And what's your thesis on, Miss, Miss-- - Howard. The role of motivational psychodynamics and interpersonal relationships in sports oriented goals. (chuckling) - Sorry you asked? - Hi. - Hi yourself. - Long time no see. - Year and a half. But who's counting. - You look great. Something's different though, is it your hair? - No, it's just longer. - You know you don't want do a thesis about this yo yo. You need to do you know, your major work on someone who's warm and exciting and colorful and vital and thrusting. - Really? You know anyone like that? - I gotta go. Listen, I'll see you guys at practice. - Take it easy, Newt. - You got a place to stay yet? - We'll figure it out. - Take it easy on 'em. - You know, it might surprise you to know that I have some historical information about athletes. - Really? - I mean I bet you don't even know what the ancient philosophers said. - No. - Confucius said, "Man with athletic finger "make broad jump." I mean I'm loaded with information like that. You know, anytime you name, I'll be ready for an interview. - Well that would be super. Is it Sonny? - Yeah. - What's Sonny short for? - Nothing, just a nickname. - I thought your real name was Sidney. Sidney Herbert Reston? - Sonny. S-O-N-N-Y, Sonny. - Don't panic, if you're good, I won't tell a soul. - Hey, she's lethal. - You're telling me. She's a little dangerous she is. - What's with you two, anyway? Oh she's the one? - Yeah, she's the one. - Well what do ya know? Listen you, you little hussy, you broke my poor little buddy's heart. - I think it was the other way around. - You animal! - What do you say we have dinner and we'll talk about it? - Sounds good to me, I can make it. - Okay, I know a quant little place. Can you be there at 6:30? - I think I can swing that. - Oh, Catch, don't you have an appointment with Doames in 10 minutes? (laughing) And you S-O-N-N-Y, your appointment's right after his. - What's the name of this quant little place? - Pam's place, 6:30 sharp. - I can make it, too, I can make it. - Scott. - Not a whole lot, okay. Number one on the hit parade. A tear down, on the beach, $550, unfurnished. - No, the waves go through the living room. - I did not pick it. Okay, how about a studio? Near the beach, $350. Furnished. - No I've seen it, it's (mumbles) - He's tough. You're up, Sonny. - Look all right? - You look fine. Good luck. - I can handle him. - Now I'm a mirror. - Sit down. - Hey, cute little guy. Is he yours? - Why you wanna play on this team? - I want to go to the Olympics. - Why? - Why? - That's what I said, why? - I don't know. - You don't know? You're gonna give up two years of your life for no pay, and I'll work your butt off to stay in shape. But you don't know why. - Well, because if we win-- - What if we lose? You're a damn good player, Reston. But I'm gonna tell you something. I'm gonna be watching you like a bug under a microscope for the next two weeks. You don't come up with the right answers, I don't know if you'll be the right man for the team. This is the housing list. Rentals are high, but it's a good guideline. By the way, the staff found you a job. - Thank you. - I want you to keep one thing uppermost in your mind when you leave here. From now on wherever you go, whatever you do, you represent the team. You got that? - Yes. - That's all. - Thank you. - Send in Landow. Reston? Close the door. - Sidney Herbert's late, I guess we'll just start without him. - He was born late, and he's kind of uptight about that Sidney stuff, maybe you better just, call him Sonny. - Don't worry, I won't be (mumbles) Here you go. - Okay. - Mr. Reston here, we got everything? - Let me get your chair for ya. - Thank you. - There we go, how do you make this machine work? - Just punch the power. Viola! - Hm, well since Mr. Reston's not here, I will take his seat, I can barely see ya from the far end of the table. - It's okay by me. - Here we go. - To volleyball. - To us. - Catch-- - Hey come on. It's only a toast. Won't commit ya to anything. Your apartment's sure nice. - Thanks. Think Sonny'll like what you rented? - Doesn't have much choice, does he? Have some salad? - Thanks. - I'm relieved about my job. You know, real estate development. Should be right up my alley. - It is. If I remember correctly, political science was right up your alley. - Let's say we not get into that. - Let's not get into it so fast you mean? - Yeah. Eat your spaghetti, kid. - No, I just want to make sure things are right where we left 'em. Certainly are, you're still the same old Catch. Forget to do what you're really passionate about. Just get out there and get a mortgage, nice little job, and make babies. - What's wrong with that? - Nothing, providing you do what you're really cut out to do. For someone else, real estate development is great. For you, it's all wrong. It's not your life's work and shouldn't be. You should have gone for your masters. - Hey, you get your masters. I'll do what I want, okay? I suppose you think playing for the team's all wrong, too, huh? - No. I think it's wonderful, as long as you go back to school when it's over with. As long as you finish something. What's the use. We probably had this conversation 100 times before. (knocking) It's open. - Ta-da! Ready for this? Welcome to the Town and Country Hotel, my name is Sonny Reston, Junior Management Trainee. (upbeat music) - [Man] Drive it hard, drive it hard, come on. You're an old man, you gotta work a little harder. Let's go! - Lard count. - 8.0. Come on, let's go. Come on Sonny, get it out. Okay Sonny, that was good, one more time. - I don't wanna live. - Just watching, I work out too. Hey, I'm sorry about last night. - Oh you are, are ya? (gentle music) ♪ Always wondered what it would be like ♪ ♪ To kiss you ♪ ♪ Kissing you is more than worth the waiting ♪ ♪ Ever since we met my love ♪ ♪ I've lived the life of anticipating ♪ ♪ Waiting for the next time we make love ♪ - [Man] Thanks boss. - [Man] You got it. - [Marcia] Leave it on. - Sorry, thought you were asleep. - No I like the TV on. It makes me feel like maybe there's another person around here. - Hey listen, I'm really beat. Can I take a shower, then we'll talk? - Yeah, you mean, I'll talk, and you'll fall asleep? - Can I take a shower? - Yeah, go ahead, take a shower. - It's that bad, huh? - Yeah it's that bad. - What do you want me to do? - Nothing much. Grow up. Newt, I'm 31 years old. You're 33, man, don't you think it's about time? - You look pretty good for 31 though. - Could you be serious, just this once? Newt, I want you to quit the team. - Honey, I can't quit the team. - Newt, I've been hanging in there for six years. Six years in these rotten apartments in towns I hate. - This isn't such a bad town, I mean, people save up all their money and they come here to retire. It's a great town. - Yeah, oh it's a great town. If you got money and a home and a family. It's a real nightmare if you're married to an overgrown kid, who's wasting his whole life on a dream. - It's not a dream. We're gonna do it this year, we're gonna win a medal. - A medal? What am I supposed to do with this medal? Hold it? Love it? Talk to it? Make a life with it? No. I want a husband who spends some time with me. Newt, a baby. I want a normal life. You know what I want. Why do you make me tell you over and over and over, like you're deaf? (sighing) Listen to me. I'm turning into a shrew. Newt, you're driving me crazy. (hollering) - What the hell's going on here? - He taped my left foot first. - So? - So it's bad luck for me. I like my right foot taped first. - Oh I see. Superstitious? Well we wouldn't want any bad luck to happen to him, would we Bill? Tell me something, Mr. Reston, have you ever tried sticking a rabbit's foot up your ass? - No sir, I haven't tried that one yet. - Well I recommend it highly. It just so happens I'm fresh out of rabbit's feet this morning, so what we're gonna do, we're gonna organize a workout session for you when practice session is over. (mumbles) don't you, Mr. Reston? - Soon as I'm taped. - As soon as you're taped. It's 8:05, what's five minutes here or there? Doesn't mean a thing. - Boy I'm sure glad I'm not gonna be in your shoes this morning. (talking over each other) - Reston, let's go. (talking over each other) Dig, dig! (chattering) - [Man] Come on Sonny, touch it. Come on, Sonny. Touch it, Sonny, go! (grunting) - What I'm saying is, he has a coaching philosophy that says a winning team pushes beyond-- - Now what I'm saying is that what he did to Sonny was cruel and unjust punishment. - And I disagree. Winning teams don't have prima donna's. And Sonny, I'm sorry to say, is an A-1 first class prima donna. Doames always says-- - Oh Doames, Doames say, who the hell is he, God? Just a coach on a lousy volleyball team. - He's not just a coach. He's building the best team in American. The best men, the best spirit, the best attitudes. - What are you, his little PR (mumbles). Are you a retainer or what? I'm sorry. God, I don't know maybe I'm not cut out for this whole damn thing. - Here, sit down. Come here! (gentle music) - You died and went to heaven, sweetie. Sonny, Sonny Reston, hey. Hey, don't listen, I can explain it all right. I lost your number. Honest. You died and went to heaven, sweetie, it's Sonny. Yeah, how you been? Great, good. Well I've been meaning to call, but I've been running raged. But I've been thinking about you a lot. Yeah, so what's going tonight? Can't ya break it for a little Sonny, come on? Can't you break it? Congratulations. Hey, listen, somebody's at the door, I gotta go, okay? You died and went to heaven, sweetie. Yeah, yeah, Sonny. No I'm not, no. I think I can make it later, what time? Oh I'll be a little late. All right, but I'll see ya okay? Call ya later, yeah. (chattering) (hollering) What kind of team is this anyway? A guy doesn't get a wakeup call? (chattering) - Hello, Mr. Reston, glad you could join us for our little trip. Because frankly in another 60 seconds, we'd have left without you, that's company policy. I see you have a nice set of luggage there. - Yeah, sure. - You wouldn't happen to have a shirt and tie in there, would ya, and a jacket? - [Sonny] Yes, I do. - Nice pair of pants, other than blue jeans? - As a matter of fact, I do. - Well good, what I want you do is I want you to take out those items I mentioned. - Right here. - Right now, I want you to take them out, I want you to strip down, I want you to put on a nice shirt and tie, pair of pants, and that jacket. Go on, don't be shy. Go on. We want you to look like a gentleman. We want your fans to love you to pieces. (hollering) (upbeat music) (yelling over each other) - Oh, Mr. Sonny! Oh, is it really you in the flesh? I've been watching you play, you're so fabulous. I just, oh-- - Get lost! - Oh you say the sexiest things. (giggling) Can I have your autograph, please? I'd just die. - Where would you like it, sweetie? - Oh, would right here be okay? - Yeah, fine. (hollering) - [Tony] This is Tony Lother, reporting on the USA men's volleyball team as it leaves on a domestic tour of 10 cities in as many days. The underdog US team ranked 19th in the world, is challenging powerful Soviet block teams, which have dominated the sport internationally for years. A volleyball match consists of the best three of five games, each game played to 15 points. Only the serving team can score points. If the non-serving team wins a rally, it's called a side out, and it earns the right to serve. Veteran spiker, Newt Steinbech is leading the US team's assault against Bulgaria and Poland. Tomorrow the tour moves to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and then on to Dayton, Ohia, Des Moines, Iowa, and Pocatello, Idaho. Point USA. All American Catch Viecelli is one of several new recruits including Sonny Reston and Steve Landow, who have sparked tonight's amazing USA showing against Poland, here in Pocatello. It's a good thing, too, because Coach Doames still has to cut another eight players from his team before they reach the Olympics. Who goes next is anybody's guess. The team arrived home just in time to watch the boys on the pro circuit go for big prize money. In order to maintain their amateur status, members of the US team cannot participate in this popular sporting event. - [Announcer] Action in all four courts. Court one and two, third round, are the winners bracket. On courts three and four, second round are the losers bracket. The lovely lady-- - Check it out. Fox alert. - [Announcer] We have an emergency. Lost one bikini top, found one bikini bottom. Wanted one chilly young lady. - It's Cuervo Gold. - Man, these tour guys really rate. Think she likes me. She's looking at me. - Hi guys. - What do you say to your friends out there? There she is, guys, Miss Puerto Caribbean. Look at those rippling muscles. - Look at that. I could have hammered that one with my eyes shut. Wanna know what these guys'll walk away with? Big bucks, that's all I know. - Yeah, but they don't go to Japan, and you do. - Doesn't he ever get tired of his own company? - Some people don't mind being alone. Like you, I'm sure you're never bored with yourself. - Hell no, I'm one of the more interesting persons I know. (laughing) - But you've only been back two days. Now you're going to Japan? - Yeah, now we're going to Japan. - But that's another 10 days. Newt, I want you to listen to me. I'm starting to freak out. - Honey I think you ought to keep busy. I know you've been looking for a job, but if you could just maybe find some work. - What kind of job do you think I'm gonna find? With a BA in Art History? I majored in how to be the perfect wife, Newt. And now I'm unemployed. And I can't go back to school, that costs money. If you don't do something to change this, Newt, I'm telling you I don't know what I'm gonna do. I feel like I'm losing my mind. And you don't even give a damn. - Ooh, she be spittin' nails, huh? (upbeat music) (chattering) - [Announcer] Today's live broadcast is coming to you via satellite, directly from the sport's palace in Nagoya Japan. The strong Japanese team hasn't lost to the Americans in 13 years, but the US team is climbing fast up the international ladder, ranking now in the top 10. Japan, the 1972 Olympic Champion, opens the match with service. (chattering) Catch Viecelli is on the attack for the United States, and scores a point. That score tied at two games a piece. USA attempting match point in the fifth game. Catch Viecelli with another powerful spike to turn the tables for the United States, as they win the best three of five game match, three games to two. (hollering) - Hey man, we forgot Reston. Let's go, dude. (chattering) - (mumbles) poster. - Sure, sure. Two t-shirts, right? Could you run upstairs and get that for him? Two t-shirts. (mumbles) Where's Sonny? - He's not feeling too well, his stomach's been acting up. (chattering) - [Female] We have big party, you like a fox who fuck me. No, you fuck me first. - Sonny! Hey Sonny, where've you been? - Girls, here he is, this is my best friend in the whole world. What did ya say your name was? This is my buddy, Catch. (talking over each other) - Listen to me, buddy, I just told Doames that you're sick. You go in there lookin' like you are right now man, it is-- (talking over each other) - Hello, people. Sorry I'm late. I don't feel good, or something. Coach. (somber music) ♪ What can I tell you ♪ ♪ What can I say ♪ ♪ I stand today just like every other day ♪ - [Man] I wanna get laid. A hand job, a blow job, anything. Come on Carlos, old buddy. I wanna get fucked. Oh yeah. ♪ Always caught with something deep inside ♪ - [Man] Earl, see what she wants.

He said he'd be right down. - [Coach Doames] All right, load 'em up. We're leaving without him. (airplane rumbling) - Hey buddy, how you doing? Just posted a month of drills for you, Coach (mumbles). - So what else is new? Coach dumped me after he puts me through a week of that crap. - He won't dump ya-- - I'm not going through that again. I'm leaving. - You can't man, the team needs you-- - Bull shit. (mumbles) - [Coach Doames] Reston! - I'm not perfect, I'm human I make mistakes. - Sonny! Coffee? - No. - [Coach Doames] Sit down. - [Sonny] Did you get my letter? - Yes, I read your letter. But I don't accept it. - [Sonny] All of it? - All of it. - Figured. Let's take it one part at a time. I apologized on that. - For missing the plane? - Yeah I said I was sorry. - Missing that plane, Mr. Reston, is unacceptable behavior as a member of this team. So is your getting drunk. As a matter of fact, there are a lot of things about you that are unacceptable. - What more can I say than I'm sorry? I apologized, that's not enough. I'm not free to make mistakes, I'm not free to say I'm sorry, Coach, I guess I just don't understand what makes a guy like you tick? - You know it's not your job to find out what makes me tick. Your job is to play volleyball as best you can. On a team, incidentally, that could be the best in the world. We have different ideas. I think what we have here, Mr. Reston, is two different notions of freedom, yours and mine. You know you, a lot of guys like you. Don't have the beginning of an understanding of what freedom really means. I don't think you understand personally (mumbles) freedom. Freedom is not the right to act indiscriminately any old way you choose, Mr. Reston. We do not bend your arm, put a gun to your head, or force you to play ball with us. As long as you remain a member of this team, you will hear and respond to the standards set by this team. Is that clear? You're an incredible ball player, potentially, I repeat potentially might be an asset to this team. - But you think putting me through a week of coach on one will make me acceptable? - No. I believe it presents an opportunity for you to shape up. If you have the guts. - The way I see it, Coach, you're looking for an ass to kick around and you think you found one. - Well that's your humble opinion, isn't Mr. Reston? As long as you're a member of this team, the rules are mine, not yours. - Tell ya what, Coach, I don't like your opinions. And I don't like your rules. I don't like 'em and I don't need 'em so I'm gonna exercise that freedom you were talking about. As of today, I quit! - It does not surprise me, Mr. Reston. - Simmer down, Celli. What choice did Coach have? He had to discipline him. - What is this, the marines? It's just a sport. - Come on, Sonny was begging for it. - Sonny's our best outside hit. (mumbles) He's just a big kid. Can't win a medal without him. Doames wouldn't give him an inch. Jesus, this whole thing, just get to me. (chattering) - I didn't expect you to understand it. But you're gonna accept it. It's a team effort and you're all going. - What's this got to do with volleyball? - Well, every team needs cohesiveness. The kind that toughs up the bad time together. Outward Bound is a program that fosters that kind of feeling, it's good hard physical stuff. - We're doing that everyday. - And I think it builds spirit. - Can we bring our girlfriends along? - Not yours, she's too ugly. - What are we gonna do, climb a mountain and pray we win? - Something like that. You can bring candles if you'd like, Catch. (chattering) (birds chirping) - All right, welcome to Outward Bound. Put your personal gear off to the side. The equipment you see around here is what we're gonna be taking on the course. Okay, Catch, this is it. This is your wardrobe, (mumbles) head, with food. It's all you got, take care of it. Put your strap on right, you'll blister your shoulders. Okay, go on over to the trail head. All right you guys, how you coming? - [Men] Left, left, left right left. Left, left, left right left. ♪ My legs are long, my pants are tight ♪ ♪ My balls keep swinging from left to right ♪ - [Men] Left, left, left right left ♪ My legs are long, my pants are tight ♪ ♪ My balls keep swinging from left to right ♪ - [Men] Left, left, left right left - Okay, this is a practice play. Procedure we're gonna use when we're up on the rock. Rope goes around Chris's back, wraps around his arm. So in the instance that the climber falls, (mumbles) brings the rope across the front of his chest. Catch, Catch come on, man. On the volleyball court you can afford to mess up, but out here, you mess up and someone's gonna (mumbles). (dramatic music) (wind whirring) (gentle music) (intense music) - [Man] Okay, I'm okay. Climbing, climb. - Steve. You awake, man? - [Steve] I am now. - You ever do anything crazy? - [Steve] You mean crazy crazy? Off the wall crazy? (mumbles) - [Steve] I once drove 180 miles in the rain to bring a girl flowers. - What happened? - Nothing. She wasn't home. (laughing) Ah, it's okay though. My mother was home. (laughing) I'll tell ya, a lot people thought I was crazy when I quit my residency to play volleyball. - Think I was crazy if, I told you I wanted out? - Out? There's no out. We're stuck here. (mumbles) - O-U-T out. Off the team. - You mean it? - I'm beginning to think this whole thing's like off the deep end crazy. I don't understand the coach. God, I don't know why the hell I tried out for this-- - Hey, hey. All you need is a steak. Some deer, and a good night's sleep. - What is that, your medical opinion? - Yeah, no charge. - What a guy. - If you're still feeling bad in the morning, give me a call. - [Announcer] Tonight's Sports Special will feature the USA men's volleyball team, which just concluded a grueling three week-- - Here we go, just what the world needs. Volleyball players in snow suits. - [Announcer] That was designed to unify his team, and commented for Sports Special when the team returned this afternoon. - [Coach Doames] I'm not saying anyone liked it. It was one tough trip, but I am proud of what the team accomplished. I think that they-- - Now what did ya do that for? He was stroking you guys. - Ah, he didn't mean it. That was just for public consumption. - You know don't give him credit for anything do you? - I won't give him credit. Now listen, sweetheart, (mumbles) that was the coldest most rottenest, most miserable trip of my life. - Now, Mr. Viecelli, if you lie down on this couch, we will continue with your analysis. You see, Mr. Viecelli, you are a very, as they say in America, screwed up individual. You do not know what you want, and therefore, we will have to submit you to some very deep probing. We will start with your shirt. Did you not (mumbles) when this shirt is on. Ooh. (laughing) (mumbles) ticklish. Ah, this ticklish is very (mumbles). This calls for drastic measures. We will have to remove your pants. (laughing) (gentle music) - Okay, this'll be the big one. Best in the world will be there. Cuba, Japan, East Germans, Polls, Soviets. They're more experienced, older, and they play for keeps. We'll start in Warsaw, go to (mumbles), go back to Warsaw. One thing, boys, where you are, and who you are. That's it, that's all. - [Man] Hey, does he mean for keeps? - [Man] For keeps? You mean screw up and we're history man. - [Man] Final cut time, last chance to stay on the team. - [Tony] Hello, again, everyone. This is Tony Lovett, live from Warsaw, Poland.

Ice cream? Okay, chocolate? - That means no. - Oh, I didn't know you spoke Polish. How about this one? Okay, vanilla. Okay, three vanilla. Two vanilla. - Figures they'd only have vanilla. You know I always hated vanilla, even as a kid I hated vanilla. In case you guys haven't noticed, nothing has gone right in this country so far. I mean how about that game? They cheated us, man, they out and out cheated us. - Yeah, I know, wait till next year, they're gonna be on our turf and we will kick their butts. - Anything but vanilla, not even Haagen-Dazs nothing but vanilla. - Don't look now, guys, but I think there's a woman. I think there's a woman that's been following us ever since the game was over. - I'm gonna go see what she wants. (alarm wailing) (speaking in foreign language) Hi. My name's Catch. We're with the US Men's Volleyball Team. - I know. I saw you play today. - You speak English. - I went to school in America. - You gotta be kidding me. How? - I was an exchange student but that was before. My mother became ill. A few months ago she died. It was right at the time martial law was imposed. I couldn't leave. I was trapped. - Are you gonna stay here? - Oh you don't understand. I'm trapped, I must go back to America. Peter is there. Look, I wanna show you. Here he is. He's waiting for me. He doesn't know what happened. I can't even write what I want in a letter. These. These are my family, you see? Everyone I love is there. I must go back. How can I explain what it's like here? Watching all the time. You never know who is listening. Who is following. I know this is going to sound strange, but I was hoping maybe you could help me. You see, I have these papers, documents. What I need someone to do-- - Hey, wait a minute. - Please, don't say no, it would be so simple for you. I have it all worked out. Look. You see, so simple? You carry posters, lots of posters, I've seen them. Nobody will be bothering you, not the American team. I know. - Wanda. Honestly, I'd like to help you. - Please. - I'll see what I can do. - Would you? - Let's go, let's go, let's go! (chattering) - Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey. Check out the incredible hulk with the gun at the door. What are you gettin' us into? - She needs help. Hey look, she's not asking for much, she needs somebody to hand carry these letters, forward it to the right lawyer in the states. She can't mail 'em here because they open the mail. Hey it could speed up her immigration status by years. - What are you gonna do if you get caught? - I won't get caught. - What if you do? - I'm American, they won't mess with an American. - Hey look, do you realize that if you do get caught, you're gonna be making things really rough for not only her but her whole family. - And what are you gonna do if the press gets a hold of this? - Not to mention the coach. Huh, I mean the coach is gonna bounce your buns off this team so fast that you're head's gonna spin. - I'm gonna do it. - Go for it, dude. - Right bud. - Thanks, Jack. (speaking in foreign language) - Hey, where's Doames? - He took an earlier flight. (speaking in foreign language) - [Announcer] All passengers for flight 402 ready to board at gate 12. (speaking in foreign language) All passengers for flight 402 ready for boarding at gate 12. (speaking in foreign language) - Check it out. - There goes the gold. - Can't look over there, too suspicious. (speaking in foreign language) - Papers. - Is there some problem, sir? (speaking in foreign language) - [Announcer] Leaving from gate 12, all passengers on board. - Who is this? - It's Tom Selleck. - All the same. This Tom-- - Selleck. - Tom Selleck, who is he? - He's an American movie star. - Any of you guys back there see where those clowns took Catch? - [Man] Nah. - I have a report on you. About you and a girl, Polish girl. Wanda (speaking in foreign language). Sound familiar. - Yeah, I met her in Warsaw. In an ice cream parlor and we talked a little bit. She went to school in the states. She knew English. - What time is this plane supposed to take off? - About 10 minutes ago. - Anything else? - No sir. - Go. (speaking in foreign language) Go, go, go. (speaking in foreign language) - [Pilot] This is Captain (mumbles) speaking. All passengers continuing on to New York will have 15 minutes to change plans in Vienna. - Wow, what took you so long? - Ice cream was melting. Hold this. - This is disgusting. (laughing) - Check it out guys. Read 'em and weep. - All right dude. (laughing) - They're vanilla papers. - That's great, that's great. You wanna take your cone back now? Hope you have a napkin because if you don't this is going all over your jacket. (talking over each other) - Catch! Catch, hi! - Hey Newt. This guy here's looking for ya. - You Mr. Newton Steinbech? - Yeah. Christmas card? I just got my welcome home. Divorce papers. - Sorry. - [Catch] That tour was lousy. They Poland be great fun, you know. Last (mumbles) blast. - [Pam] You must (mumbles) one good match and you'll feel great. - Nah, it's not it. It's a trip, trip is a real eye opener. Apparently the world's in deep yogurt. You know, people are miserable. What am I doing bouncing my ball around? Jesus, what a big deal, huh? - Catch, you just can't. - No, no. Really it's like, what's this whole fricken thing about? I don't know. Who cares? - You do. - You wanna know what I care about? I want to live a normal life with the girl I love. - What are you talking about? Is this a proposal or a proposition? I want this in writing. - Quit shoving little girl. It's a proposal. - [Sonny] Well what do you think? - [Catch] It's awesome man, totally awesome. - [Sonny] Join the circuit, you can have one in every color. Come on, take a look around. How about the last two bedroom with the pool view and jacuzzi, tennis courts. Terrific deal. See the blonde? - [Catch] How could I miss her? - [Sonny] The one on the left, cute huh? - [Catch] Yeah. - [Female] Hi Sonny. - [Sonny] Sister act. Good, I'll introduce ya. - [Catch] Thanks, but I'll pass. - Oh yeah I forgot, (humming) So how's the little shrink? - Pam, she's great. Actually, that's a lie. Right now she's plenty PO'd at me. - What did ya do, forget her birthday? - Worse. Thinking about quitting the team. - You're kidding. - Nope. - I don't believe it. Why? - Well you know why. You were there. Should have left when you did. - Hey a lot of water under the bridge since then. You're awful close to the Olympics. - That's not the end of the world. And look at you, you left, you're doing great. - Well hold it, what are you gonna do, follow me around the rest of my life? - Come off it buddy, nah. (mumbles) been begging me the last two or three months to join the circuit. - Hey, wow. Look Celli, you know me, diarrhea mouth. I mean I talk a good stick. Circuit's okay for someone like me, but you? The Olympics, that's class. Don't do it, Celli. You'll regret it. I'll never get a crack at anything like that again. Hey, Sherry, Sherry. I want you to meet my best friend. - [Celeste] It's Celeste. - Celeste. - [Celeste] Hi Sonny. - Hi Sherry. Catch Viecelli. - How do you do? How about we get some (audio cuts out) go for the hot tub? - Sounds like fun. - Okay, sounds good. - Ready? (gentle music) - Well you're gonna want these. - Well what about the rest of this stuff? Don't you want anything? The TV? - No, no you keep it. I could use the little coffee pot. - Okay. Here. The cord's inside. Newt, I hope you win. I hope the Olympics are worth it. - Marcia, I tried. - Yeah, I guess you did. - Have you had a lover? - Newt, that was never the issue here. - [Newt] Do you? - No. Not anymore. He just left me his keys. - Wow. Hey, you're on the US volleyball team. You guys are going to the Olympics. Boy you really play. Where'd you learn? - [Catch] At college. - I figured. You're good. Think maybe if I practice I can make a college team? - Yeah, I bet you could. - I'd like to play at the Olympics. I bet you think that's crazy. - Nah, that's not crazy. Why do you want to play at the Olympics? - Why wouldn't I? If you win the medal then the whole world knows your country's the best. I'd like to be best. Wouldn't you? - Yeah, I sure would. So what do you think your dad would say if your team lost, you know, and you weren't the best? - Well, he says it happens a lot. He says it hurts but that's the breaks. Hey you know what? My grandfather almost made the Olympic swimming team. - Yeah? - He got sick and couldn't go. - That was the breaks huh? - But he almost made it. He said that's all I talked about for the rest of his life. How he almost made it. I'm sure gonna try. I'm a terrible swimmer though. But my dad says I've got a chance at volleyball. - [Man] Gary, come on! Come on! - Well, good luck to you. - [Gary] Thanks, thanks a lot. (phone ringing) - Yeah? 3:00? Good. (mumbles) I know, I know. I'd like to keep all of 'em. Okay. (grunting) - Let's go! - Steve. I wanted you to see it before I posted it. I'm sorry. - Wait a minute. I haven't been late for one practice in all these months I've been here. - I know that Steve. - If you know that then why I am being cut? - You work as hard as anybody here. - I know I work as hard as anybody here. - Somebody has to be cut, Steve. - So you're, fine, I'm a damn good player. - Yes, you are. - That's what you're gonna say again. Not good enough to make the Olympics. - I know. Calm down, Catch. - It's not fair. Why would he cut a guy like Steve, huh? You should have seen the look on Steve's face. - And who would you suggest he cut? Name one player on that team who isn't good? You think the coach likes doing it? - I don't care what the coach likes. I don't care what he doesn't like, I'm sick of worrying about it. I'm sick of the whole damn game. - You my dear are looking for an excuse to quit. - Just stop analyzing me. - Well I'm gonna tell you something, Catch Viecelli. I love you, I really do. But I do not intend to tell my children their father was a quitter. - Is that what you think? - Yes. - Going somewhere? I heard rumors. You could have at least told me to my face. - Yeah, I was headed to your office now. - Mind if I sit down? - Sit down. It's your gym. - All right. Tell me how much you hate my guts. - I don't hate anybody. - [Coach Doames] Oh come on. I'm a no good tight ass son of a bitch, ain't that right? - Wow, you really wanna get into it? - Yeah, I'd like to get into it. Tell me what's on your mind. Celli? Isn't that what your friends call you, Celli Belly? It's a wonderful name for a grown man. Come on tell me, Celli. I'm a no good son of a bitch. Can you say it to my face, or just behind my back? I'm uncaring, hard nosed, unfeeling, come on. - Who are you kidding? You don't care what I think or how I feel. Not me, not anybody else on this team. If you did it might have made things a little easier. - Easier, is that what you want? You want it easy? - You know what I want? - [Coach Doames] Tell me. - You rag us, you goat us. And you treat us like dirt under your feet. You never stopped to think for one minute that maybe one lousy little pat on the back that might work miracles. - Ah, there it goes. You know what a miracle is? A miracle is when you have the guts enough to use your God given talent. That's a miracle, that's what I like to see. You don't need a pat on the back, Celli. You need a swift kick in the ass. You don't try, you don't push. You're gutless wonder. - I won't listen to your crap-- - Oh yes you do until you're officially gone you'll listen to it. - It's official, I'm leaving. - Not till I'm through. You know what you're like? You're like your pal, Sonny. The chicken shit quitter. - Hey Sonny's no chicken. You're the coward, you're afraid, Doames, you're scared shitless. You wanna know what you're afraid of? You're afraid of us. You'd wet your pants if you got close to us. You're scared you might break down and care about us. Really care. Some flesh and blood father. Let me tell you something. I wouldn't want you for a father. And if I were your son, I wouldn't walk out of here, I'd run. And I'd run so far and fast you'd never see me again. - You wanna leave? (mumbles) What are you trying to prove? That I can bleed? I can bleed. I had a son, Catch. He died when he was 10 years old. From meningitis. I'll tell you something. He wouldn't have run away from me. In a million years, but he's gone anyway. I know about losing, I know about hurting, and I know about pain in my guts. So if any of that means anything to you, Catch, I want you to stay because we need you and because if you quit, you'll never be what you can be. It's what it's all about, isn't it? I don't think you're there yet, Catch, you're a long way (mumbles). You know, you're right about one thing. The toughest part of growing older is accepting what you may never have. (mumbles) But how you gonna know? Are you gonna know? Unless you push it beyond those limits. That's what I want for you, Catch. You've got the chance now. Once in a lifetime. (somber music) - Boys, let's gather up over here. - All right, this is it. This is what you've been working for. I'm privileged to announce that officially we have been chosen to represent the United States at the Olympics. My congratulations. (talking over each other) Now you've got the rings, let's see if you've earned the right to wear them. This is your gear. Pick it up. (chattering) Viecelli didn't call in? If he's not here by 8:00 sharp, call Landow back and cut Viecelli. - [Man] Okay, start without Catch.
