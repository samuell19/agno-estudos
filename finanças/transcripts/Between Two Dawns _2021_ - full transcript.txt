I asked you if the orders would be ready, right? - Right? - You did. - You said they would? - I did. So I told the clients they'd be ready. The steamer's acting up. That's all I needed. Tell them to get it fixed. Mr. Halil, it can't be helped. You're the foreman. You should be on top of this. You should see this coming. Give us a heads up. Should they wait for it to cool off? Tell them to fix it as usual. This isn't a game, you know. We gave you an extension last week. What am I supposed to say to these people? You're right, Mr. Halil. Now go and come back to me with a plan for how to get this done on time. The trucks need to be loaded tomorrow. OK? Yes, Mr. Halil. OK, then. - You have a tough job. - Tell me about it. The clients, the foreman, the workers. All of them are trouble. Thank God you're here. Well, I'm doing my best. There's an order. Let me quickly deliver it. To the girlfriend? Brother, please. Dad will hear about it. Don't put it off then. We'll convince dad. - Are you ready for tonight? - Yeah. Tell me if you need anything. - Your brother has your back. - Thanks. And whatever her dad says, say "OK". OK. - See you then. - Hey! - Don't be late on Skype. - I won't. I think the pink will be better. OK, honey. - Hello. - Hello. - I've brought your order. - OK. I'll drop them here, madam. "I've brought your order"? Wait, no red one? No, we've run out at the factory, too. It wasn't urgent. You needn't have. - See you kids later. - See you later, Mom. I came to see you. But you're late. - Well, you insisted I shave. - Since you only shave once a year. OK, OK. For you, I'll shave every day. You should. It suits you. Sign here, please. - Anything else I should do for tonight? - No, just show up. 9pm sharp. 8pm sharp. And don't forget, pistachio Turkish Delight. Double roasted. What a dad you have. What can we do, Esma? Mr. Orhan is like that. You think we'll get along? He's tough, but I think you'll get him to like you. We'll see. By the way... I got my period. I said you were stressing over nothing. Yeah, but I don't want to go through it again, Kadir. You won't. We'll even be sad when you have your period. - Have you told your dad? - I will. You haven't even told him you smoke. - I'll tell him, Esma. - When? We're trying to get an order ready. Working day and night, even my dad. Well, it's a factory... - So, let's get through this week. - So, next week then? - Next week. - Let's see. Then a country wedding. You mean the threshing barn in your village? So, you'd prefer the Can Wedding Hall? No way. Maybe a country wedding. - They also asked for a blue sample. - Well, how's the machine? - I'll boot up the laptop. - OK, you do that then. They're working on it. A couple of hours. Well, will the orders be ready by morning? Of course, Father. Don't worry. Everything's under control. At worst, we'll work overtime. It was the same for the Romanians. We finished them on time. You mentioned a cash flow problem. There'll be lots of extra costs now. Should we postpone it then? Well, we did the calculations and if we get these goods to them they'll transfer the money on 28th. I don't think it will be a problem. I'll also ask if we can get an advance. - Let's look at the balance sheets. - Let me grab them. - How are you, son? How's it going? - Good, Dad. I ran into Uncle Mehmet. He says hi. Ah, how is he? He never visits anymore. - He invited you to play some jereed. - That's so him. Dad. Are you coming with Zeynep and me? - No, I'll stay a little longer. - OK. Don't forget your pills. - See you soon, Kadir. - See you, Sister-in-law. We'll have to do it through the other company. - Let's be direct with them. - They're calling. I'll talk to them, don't worry. Yeah, we are pleased to give you the updates. No issues with the red and green fabrics. The samples got approved. He's asking for updates. Everything's going well. Everything is going well. The orders will be ready tomorrow. The orders will be ready until tomorrow. But we have a request. But we would like to ask you something. We need to get this payment on Monday with last month's. Otherwise, we can't get started on the new orders. We have to receive the payment on Monday together with the last month's because we needed to start for the new orders. Please do not worry, we'll make the payment once we receive the orders. We'll make the payment when we have the goods. OK, but can we get the payment when the goods are shipped? - Will they do that? - Just ask them. Can we get pre-payment when we send the products? I apologise, but I promise to pay the moment the shipment arrives. Anything else? Anything else? We had issues with customs last month, so until we can get it sorted, we'll be billing from the other company and we'll send them the contract. There was a problem on customs last month... Until we solved this problem... Sorry.- Is something wrong? Mr. Halil! Murat! There's been an accident. - What? - You need to come right now. - Turn it off. - I'm sorry, I have to go. Dad! Come with me! What's going on? Be careful! Come and help. Here! Run! Be quick! - Bring it over! - Go get the car! Careful, careful! Slowly. OK. One, two, three, up! Get him in. Kadir, grab him the other side. Easy. Just one person. Yes, he's conscious. Sorry? OK. OK. The back entrance of the ER. Yes, not more than 10 minutes. We didn't want to wait for an ambulance. Almost there anyway. OK. OK. Drive a little faster. Let's get him on the stretcher, quick. What happened to the patient? - An accident. - At the factory. One, two, three. Take the stretcher out. What's the patient's name? - What? - ID? ID... I don't have his ID. Murat. - What's his last name? - I don't know. - Are you a relative? - Employer. He got burned. - Chemical burn? - No, steam. - Hot water steam? - Yes, steam. Are you able to breathe? Let's get you outside, so they can work. Wait outside, please. Establish vascular access. - You wait outside. - Check his pulse. I'll get the chief physician. Prepare a sterile solution. Are you with me? What the hell? How did this happen to us? - I hope the guy makes it. - Don't even think about it. I got pretty scared in the car too. Thank God we got him to the hospital quickly. Shit, we pay all that money to the WHS worker. Safety kit, helmet, goggles, boots, insurance... Just hiring a worker costs 1,500 lira. I spend all this money and they don't use any of it. A whole lot of hassle. And these people are greedy too. Not here, man. Just wait and see. All his relatives will swarm in. "Can you give us a job? Can you get us insurance?" I talked to the chief physician. They're going into surgery. I think you two should go back. Be with the workers. I'll keep an eye on things here. - Let us know if anything happens. - OK, OK. Yes, I was about to tell him. OK, I'm on my way to the factory. OK, see you there. Kadir. - Yasin's waiting for you. - OK. Be careful when you visit Murat's family, OK? If they try to wheedle you, don't fall into the trap. Are our safety measures in place? Of course. I mean, is our insurance up to date and what not? Do you think it wouldn't be? They suck you dry. How could we operate without the signature of the WHS officer? OK then, nothing to worry about. Hello. I'm here to see Mr. Yasin. - He's expecting me. - Come in, Kadir. There's no entry in the system. Now, tell me again. Slowly this time. Is that with a 'Ã‡' or a 'C'? C. So it's Cavuk? Caruk? What kind of a name is that? Where are they from? Ah, OK. What's Murat Caruk's ID number? Look at his ID or whatever. Call me in five. I'm waiting. - Can't we go? - Just five minutes. Sit down a moment. It will be alright, Kadir. We'll deal with it, OK? What have you been up to? You never even swing by unless you need help. - Still playing football? - What? You used to play on Tuesdays. I got injured. I haven't played in a while. I still go on Fridays. Come and join the team. No, thanks. We go to the spa after. It's fun. Get sweaty and go to the spa. - How long will this take? - We're dealing with it. Oh, come on. Ms. Merve! - Yes, Mr. Yasin? - Please look at this, will you? - Read me the first sentence. - The cartridge is out. We bought one, but haven't put it in. Who hasn't put it in? Who is there, other than you? It's your job to do it, Merve. Bring some tea for Mr. Kadir. I'm good, thanks. Let's just get this done. - So, you have a new cartridge? - Yes. My aunt's sister-in-law's granddaughter. My aunt insisted I hire her. She keeps putting sugar in my tea, even though I don't take it. What did you do to your shirt? I'll stop and change on the way. Let's fix it now. Ms. Merve, first do the cartridge, then bring some shirts for Mr. Kadir from my locker. Okay I've got you, don't worry. Hello? Be quick. Yes. Hold on a second. OK, 18... 94... 48... 56... 25... There must be one more. That's 10 digits. One more. 20, 5. So, 205 then? I have a lot of shirts, Kadir. I keep them in the office, you know? Sometimes you go to a farm. Then half an hour later to the judge. So what do you do about the smell? I keep a couple in the car and in the office. That's how I've solved it. It's good. One of those. This should be the house. There's no number on the door. Let me go ask around. Hello. We're looking for Murat Caruk's house. Murat. His wife, Mrs. Serpil? Can I help you? - We're looking for Mrs. Serpil. - That's me. We're from Murat's work. Hello, Mrs. Serpil. Mr. Kadir is one of the owners. I'm their attorney Yasin Erkan. Is everything OK? Nothing to worry about. There was a small incident. - We wanted to let you know. - What happened? A small oversight. Mr. Murat had a little accident. An accident? What happened to him? - We took him to hospital. - Hospital? Just to make sure he's alright. Akif, get over here! - Is he OK? - Believe me, he's just fine. I just spoke with the hospital. He had a small operation and it went well. - How did it happen? - I was there when it happened. I was with him the whole time. We took him to the hospital. My father's with him. - He is OK, right? - Yes. - Can you take us there? - That's why we're here. OK, we'll be ready right away. Akif, come. Come this way. Mahmut, you know the hospital on the hill? He's there. I'm on the way. Tell Uncle Ahmet to come right away, OK? I don't know, Mahmut, we'll find out. OK, I hope so. OK, see you there. Mrs. Serpil, no need to worry people. It's just a minor accident. Mr. Kadir told you already. You'll see when we get to the hospital. You don't need to fuss about it. I'm not making a fuss. I just called his brother. OK, let's not scare the kid now. Here you go, Arif. No need. Thank you. It's just a couple of candies. Right, Arif? Here you go. Take them, Akif. Thank you. - I dropped one. - I'll get it. Where's Murat? - This is my father. - I'm very sorry. Where is he? How is he? Nothing to worry about. It's a minor accident. Where is he? Let me see Murat. - He's in the burns unit. - Burns unit? He got burnt? Your husband is our brother. The doctors are taking care of him. OK, let me see his doctor. Where is he? - OK, Mrs. Serpil... - Where is he? Dad, where's the burns unit? OK, I'll go and find someone. - Just be calm. - Is he burnt? - You probably can't see him right now. - Is he burnt? Where are the burns? - He's going to be fine. - He's OK, right? They say he's recovering. Just stay calm. Let them find out... - He is OK? - Yes, yes. He's recovering. There are burns on his body from the steam. He's receiving active liquid and oxygen treatments. You can see him by tomorrow. Hi. - Can I tell you something? - Tell me. I have this red car and its back is like a turtle. - Really? - Actually, it's a turtle car. - Very nice. - When you open the trunk... - it lights up. - Is that so? It transforms into a robot and the doors can be opened. Very flash. Can you give me a ride? But, it's a toy. Did you think it was real? It isn't real? - Is your mind more at ease, Mrs. Serpil? - Thank God. Now you talked to the chief physician? - He said he'll be fine. - Yes, inshallah. - Some scars. - There's an operation for that. Right? You're right. Mr. Ibrahim will cover that. We're all here for you. Murat will get better soon. He'll be all better, don't worry. Mr. Ibrahim has spared no expense. - Thank you. - We'll get a mini fridge in here too. - Get some fruit for Akif. - Thank you. Mrs. Serpil... Mr. Ibrahim wants to give you some extra support. What do you mean? Just a contribution to your household while Murat is in hospital. - No need, thank you. - It's nothing, take it. - No, thank you. - I mean we're just... - Mr. Ibrahim will be upset. - Just take care of Murat. We're taking care of Murat. He's family. - No need for anything else, thank you. - Take it. For Akif. I don't want it, Mr. Attorney. I won't take it. OK, then. Mrs. Serpil... We didn't want to bring this up... Murat was fully responsible for what happened to him. He tried to fix the machine without taking precautions. So now what? He hurt himself, but also the factory. All the machines have stopped. The orders are all waiting. What about the cost of that? We're trying to offer you some support. OK, Mr. Attorney, then wait until Murat gets better. Good. - Let me know if you need anything. - Thanks. - Call us if you need anything. - Where is my brother? Hello, Mahmut. He's under observation. We can't see him. This is the piece, Mr. Halil. The one that broke. - Sorry about the accident, chief. - Thanks. - So, tell me how this happened. - This is the hot water pipe. It goes through there and arrive here. When it's spinning here, the gears displace the piece I showed you. So, our guy went in and the steam... Who's your WHS officer, Halil? - Your health and safety officer. - Mr. Abdurrahman. - Coshkun? - Yes. - Did we check the security cam? - We checked them, yes. The guy went in without any safety gear. We can't see anything once he goes in. OK, so this is what we'll do. Chief, don't touch anything. They'll come to inspect the machines. - Let's go eat something, Halil. - Don't use the machine. - Is the waiver on there? - That's just a standard phrase. It wouldn't stand up in a court. She has a right to put in a complaint. - Then why do we even add that? - It would have a psychological effect. If the relative signed this and accepted the money, they'd think they've waived their rights. Even if they regretted it later, they wouldn't think to sue. That's why we add that. But the prosecutor might still open an investigation, especially since it's a workplace accident. They may do things by the book if the media gets involved. What are you saying? The media? These things can happen, Halil. These are the possibilities. That's why this statement is important. Now, alongside the woman's statement, if we can prove his alcoholism, then we can relax. Also, the foreman's saying Murat is totally at fault. I've added that to the case file. But in the court they'll say the foreman's protecting the employer. We'll be catching lightning in a bottle. The law's on the employees' side. That might get you two to six years. Those are good odds. If they give two years, I can get it down to probation or get the sentence suspended, one way or another. But if something happens to the man, my hands will be tied. I can't do anything. That's basically criminal negligence. That's why we've talked to all the witnesses. We'll add them to the file. Did any of you see what condition Murat was in? I saw him this morning. But from a distance, so I don't know. From a distance? So you couldn't tell if he was drunk? How could I? I was too far to smell his breath? Well, never mind. The judge wouldn't take your word for it anyway. Yasin, the man is a known alcoholic. He has an alcohol problem. He applied to other companies but none of them hired him. And they're very poor. - So, we thought we should help. - That just leads to trouble. OK, no need to talk about the past. Let's look ahead. Getting this woman to sign is the safest way. That'll be our most solid evidence. What if she doesn't sign? Well, if she doesn't sign... and something happens to the man, this will turn into a civil lawsuit. If the man dies, or goes into a coma, it will mean jail time. OK, it won't go that way. The doctor said so. Inshallah. That's what we all hope. We're talking about the worst-case scenario here. We hope for the best and plan for the worst. I'll sound like a doom merchant, but this man... let's say he dies, and the woman hasn't signed this? In that case, it's jail time. You two are the owners on paper. But you're the director in charge. We have to solve this, no matter what. I wish I could make it go away, Ibrahim, but that's not how it works. They usually soften up when you flash the money. This woman doesn't budge. If she took the money, the rest would follow. She'd sign. But, no... Can I look at that? There might be another way, but I don't know how you'd feel about it. A last... If there's no other... As a last resort. - Fleeing the country. - What? If you go abroad before the court proceedings, because you'll get a travel restriction if it happens, then at least you can avoid prison. - Is that possible? - If it's before the court date. The responsible has to be one of them? Yes. It would have to be. If it's not one of the owners, even if I gather all the documents, it will look suspicious. Yes, sweetheart?- How are you? I'm good. How are you?- I have butterflies in my stomach. I'm really excited as well. I'll wear a floral dress. Would you wear a white shirt, so we match? Does it have to be white? I don't have much time. You still have three hours. OK, sweetheart. I'll try to stop by at home. See you tonight. Talk to you later. Kisses. It's a long way off, but I see it as if I'm close by. My father's smiling at me. And just for that smile, I made a lot of sacrifices in the past for my family. Do I regret it? No. I'd do it again. Kids, some things are written as our fate. Since we're in this situation, we have no choice but to accept it. Yasin, do whatever it takes to help the family. How much did you say? 200,000... 300,000... It depends how hard they push. So, we're going to solve the money problem somehow. We'll solve it. So, what do we do right now? Yasin should do the talking. If it's one of you, it will be more sincere. Like a family visit. But we need to do it immediately. I'd want to go myself, but the factory... I'll handle it. - Handle what? - The statement. - Plus the kid seems to like me. - You shouldn't go alone, son. What could happen, Dad? It's fine. Alright. I have a small errand to run. Let me know if you need anything. - Can you check this out? - The insurance thing? - Are the records correct? - See if there's anything missing. Are you paying the full amount or minimum? They'll ask about that. - The full amount. - OK, good. Let me get a copy of these. - Hello. - Hello. Welcome. Mr. Kadir. Come in. - Thank you. How are you? - I'm good, thanks. This is one of Murat's bosses. Sorry about what's happened. - You shouldn't have. - It's OK. Son, please have a seat. Thank you. Is there any improvement? No, we're still waiting. We'll see him tomorrow. Inshallah. Inshallah. So, what's up? I just came to check up on you. To see if you need anything. Thank you so much. Where's Akif? I left him with the neighbor. It's tiring for him here. Can I have a word with you in private? - What about? - Why don't you say it here? We're all Murat's relatives. No strangers here. So, we can talk here. Mrs. Serpil, you know the situation. We've talked before. We're doing everything we can for Murat. Thank you. But, even if he were released from hospital tomorrow, he couldn't start working right away. We want to give you a little help. - It's enough that he's taken care of. - What kind of help? Whatever's needed, but we mean financially. Thank you. Tell us what you want in return. Mahmut... We don't expect anything. When Murat gets better, he'll come back to work in the factory. Inshallah. Just as a formality, I'll ask you to sign a statement. What statement? Well, it's not very important. Just a formality. - We don't get those formalities. - Mahmut, let him do his thing. Mr. Kadir, you should talk to Murat about it when he's better. Yeah, what's with the rush? Well, the thing is... because he was injured, the police and a prosecutor will be involved. As we told Mrs. Serpil earlier, it was caused by Murat's negligence. We don't want you to get into trouble. We just want to solve it between us. How do you know it was his negligence? Mahmut. Relax, son. Just be patient. Let's listen. Please, continue. Like I said, it's just a formality, just to avoid it dragging on in the judicial system. Have a look if you want. My head's already full. Just read it, so everyone can hear it. It's actually for Mrs. Serpil, in case they pressure her with questions. Questions about the factory, about Murat and so on. So, our attorney wrote this statement, so you'll have no further trouble... Son, just read it, so everyone can hear it. "I have been summoned to the office of the Attorney General "as part of the investigation with regard to the accident "that took place on August 13th, 2019, "in which my husband, Murat Caruk, was involved. "I have given my verbal statement to the prosecutor "with my attorney, Yasin Erkan." "My written statement is as follows: "The owner of the factory, Halil Bulut, "has helped my husband tremendously in securing a career. "While other companies would not hire my husband, Mr. Halil gave him a job "and has always helped our family. "I am aware that he has told his friends that he is confident in himself "and that he works faster "when he does not follow the safety procedures, "despite being warned repeatedly by his foreman to follow the rules. - "Although my husband has not..." - Who's saying this? Son, just be patient. Let's just hear him out. Go on, son. "My husband steered clear of his old habits "until after the birth of our son, "when he started to drink at nights" "and went to work aggravated." Alcohol? Who's saying this? - Mahmut, son. Stay calm. - Who wrote this? How about you step out for a minute? Come, let's go. Is this the attorney writing this? I'll fuck you up, you piece of shit! Who the hell are you? You lying bastards! We're in a damn hospital. OK, son. Sit down. What's just...? Son, just sit. Go on, son. Go on. "When I heard about the accident, I remembered "that my husband did not follow the safety procedures." "Regarding the accident, the owners of the factory..." Did I say anything like this? - Hold on a second! - Where did you get that from? You think we're going to let you? Did I say anything like this? - Just calm down for a minute. - Calm down? What? Did I call him an alcoholic? I'm trying to find a resolution. You're not letting me. You know this is how legal cases go. There has to be a written statement. It's for your benefit. Is this humane? Is what you're doing fair? Look, you help me, I help you. This is the only way to get through it. We're worried about Murat's life here! Calm down! Just calm down! Mr. Kadir, son. I'm so sorry about Mahmut. He's young and hot-headed. And it's very fresh. I know, I know. But I only came here to find a way. I get it. I get it. But the part about alcohol... He had issues in the past, but he hadn't been drinking recently. OK, but our attorney wrote this by talking to Murat's friends. He has been drinking. So, what sum are we talking about? If Mrs. Serpil accepts, we'll come to an agreement to ease her troubles. Alright. I'll talk to her about it. She can't think clearly just now. She needs the money, in case Murat's not OK. - For Akif's sake. - That would be great. Really, if you talk to her, it would be great. Thank you so much. Welcome, sir. - How are you? Hope all is well. - Thank you. What can I get you, sir? We have all kinds. Pistachio, hazelnut, walnut, pomegranate. Double roasted, unroasted. The delights of Turkish delight. With pistachio. Double roasted. - OK, sir. Take away or is it a gift? - Gift. OK. This is a top-notch delight. Ten out of ten. Made with pure cane sugar. - Taste it. - I'm good. This is fresher than fresh. Real pistachio, no additives. Listen, I'm really in a rush. I'll take a kilo of that. We won't serve unless you taste it. And it's rude to refuse a gift. It's halal. Take it. That's it. Is that good or what? Did you love it or love it? - Yes, it's good. I'll take it. - By all means, sir. Pity the person who doesn't get any! Is it a special occasion? I'll fix you up a really nice box. It costs a little extra, but it looks flashier. We're here. Where've you been? You didn't pick up. Don't ask. Lots of problems. I'll tell you later. - You didn't wear the white shirt. - I couldn't stop by the house. But you look so beautiful. You look good, too. Come on. - Welcome, Kadir. - Thank you. - How are you? - I'm fine, thank you. - How are you? - Fine too. Here you go. - You shouldn't have. - It's nothing. Thank you. Go on inside. Dad? - Kadir. - Yes - Welcome, young man. - Thank you. Good evening. - How are you? - I'm good. You? Me too, thank you. Let me bring some slippers. Have a seat. We were expecting you at 8pm. Yes, it was hectic at work today. I ended up being later than I intended. Sorry for keeping you waiting. Being hard-working is important, but a man should keep his promises. Yes, yes. Sometimes... unexpected things can happen. - Here you go. - Thanks. So, if you're working this late, things must be good at the factory. - Can't complain. - Is that... good or bad? Good. Good. I don't like ambiguous answers like that. Got it. What type of production is being done? Excuse me? - At the factory, what do you make? - Textiles. - Textiles. - Yes, textiles. And thread. Remember I told you, Dad? We get all ours from there. Yes, yes. I remember now. Trade's a difficult job. Dealing with workers, customers. It's tough, right? Yes, yes. It also has its upsides. Of course, if you like what you do. - It's good. - Yes. Well, what are your plans for the future? Working at the factory? For now, yes. I do have other plans too. Like what? As well as my current job, I'm interested in organic dyes. Yes, I have an e-commerce project, which involves recycling used clothes dyed with organic dyes. Good, good. Dinner's ready. OK, then. Let's go. Come on. Come this way, Kadir. - May I use the bathroom? - Let me show you. Hey, how about a little spark? Or they won't let you have me. - I'll get you one way or another. - Kadir! Go wash your face. Get yourself together. Come on. Dear, pour me a glass of water, would you? Yes? I've been calling, why didn't you pick up? Brother, they refused to sign. You can't make anything happen. Why are they even reading it? Well, that's how it had to be. It was getting messy. So? What are we going to do now? My mistake was to trust you with this. Brother... I talked to one of the relatives. He's going to help. You think we have time for this? What kind of help? You couldn't make this happen smoothly. Anyway, I'm at Esma's now. I was already late. I'll call you when I get out. Everything's delicious. Thank you. It wasn't me. Esma made everything. - God bless you. - Bon appetit. Thank you again for having me. - It is great to meet you. - We're also delighted to meet you. We love having guests. But, without a doubt, we've never had a guest like you. As you know, most people here wouldn't do this. People find it odd. There are customs, traditions. They think it's a bit modern. Thankfully, Esma, since childhood, has never brought us any shame. Nothing to embarrass us. When she told us about you, we just had to meet you, isn't that right? Yes and we're glad to have you. - Thank you. - So... What are your family's thoughts about this? We haven't really gone into detail, but of course they know about us. Son, time and tide wait for no man. - Right? - Yes. If you want something, you need to take the bull by the horns. - Right? - Yes. People say it's fate or kismet, but it's just human weakness. Fate or kismet. People also have free will, right? Yes. I'm not really into these things. You always strive to do your best, and you just let the rest flow. I think you're right. By the way, Dad, Kadir also plays the saz. Is that so? How nice. - Will you play us something? - Another night, for sure. We have two saz players. Can't we hear a couple of songs? Of course. Which region do your favorite songs come from? Well, I don't know much about regions. I just know how to make some noise. Don't be modest, son. If you know how to play, own it. Yep. She's right. Let me go grab my saz. Since you're good at it, you can show us your skills. And after all our insistence, you ought to play. Oops, dinged it. My parents both want to hear it, so you have no choice, Kadir. Hope I didn't mess up the tuning. I banged it somehow. Just a second. No, it's fine. Do you know the one by Mahzuni Serif, called "Here I Go, My Black-eyed Girl"? I know the song of course. I've never played it. Nothing complicated. It's the usual B flat set-up. And then... a standard F, G, A. Right? Let's go. Maybe you should play it instead? - Nothing to be shy about, son. - Let him play what he knows. Yeah? OK, then, here you go. Play something you know. I embraced so many Thinking they were friends But my true beloved is the dark earth I wandered in vain My weariness unrewarded My true beloved The dark earth, the dark earth The dark earth, the dark earth I gave my heart to many beauties Gave my heart Gave my heart I gave my heart to many beauties Gave my heart Gave my heart But neither loyalty nor good came in return The earth has answered my every wish My true beloved The dark earth, the dark earth The dark earth, the dark earth Foreman Yusuf? Mr. Kadir. Why are you here so late? No reason. What are you doing here? We work day and night. - And the steamer? - What about it? How come it's running? - The goods have to be ready by morning. - But they said not to turn it on. It had to be done. What are you saying, man? I don't get it. Who said to do this? I didn't know about this. - What do you know anyway? - Excuse me? Do you know how often that machine broke? Why didn't you deal with it? I told your brother to replace the faulty equipment plenty of times. It's only 10,000 lira. Just 10. Murat is in hospital for the sake of 10k. You shouldn't run the faulty machine. Who'd listen to me? Things were different when your father ran things. But when your brother took over... Anyway, this was bound to happen. What are you saying? It was the man's own fault. What are you talking about? Listen, he was drunk, wasn't he? He drank once in a while, yes. - I even warned him the other day. - Foreman Yusuf... - Was this guy sober this morning? - How should I know, Mr. Kadir? Aren't you the foreman? Shouldn't you know? What's the difference? Either way, no safety precautions were taken. Good evening. I'd like to see the chief physician. He's not in right now, sir. Can we get hold of him? I need to reach him. Mr. Kadir? One second. How are things? Any news? They say he's alright, but we can't see him yet. Serpil's miserable. The kid's asking for his mom. Anything I can do? We'll take Serpil home. She should get some rest. She's exhausted. Tomorrow's another day. Just so you know, it doesn't look like she'll be convinced. I can drive you home if you like. No. We'll take a cab. Please. Let me give you a ride. - Why did you come? - Mahmut... To get a signature? Mahmut. - I'll shove it up your ass. - Come on, let's go. Come on. Excuse me. How can I help you, sir? I'd like to get some information on a patient from the doctor. - Patient's name? - Which doctor was it? If you gave me the name, I'll tell you, sir. Murat Caruk. Mr. Murat's doctor isn't here right now. Isn't there another doctor? I need information. - Please calm down. - I'm calm. Isn't there a doctor on duty? Just a second. Doctor, could you help me out here? Hello. - Can we speak in your room? - What's it about? We brought in an injured man from our factory. - You're from the Bulut family? - Yes, yes. Alright. This way. I want to ask something. Can a blood test show whether the patient had been drinking? - Why do you ask? - It's important. Could we tell from a blood test? I wasn't here this morning. I was on the night shift. But in a case like this, a blood alcohol test is done. So, we can tell if he drank this morning? No, we can't say for sure. Let me explain. Alcohol is metabolized at a rate of 7 grams per hour. So, for example, 21 grams of alcohol will be flushed out in 3 hours. Bodyweight, food ingestion, liver condition, all affect the results. So, certain amounts may remain in the blood for 48 to 72 hours. So? So, you can get a false positive the day after as well. Well, at least we know if he's had any alcohol, right? Can I see the results then? Sorry, we can't disclose patient information. I wouldn't bother you, if it wasn't important. I totally understand, but... I'll tell you what... Come by tomorrow, when the patient's doctor is in, and you can get the chief physician's approval. Let's get the approval now. Murat. Last name? Caruk. Murat Caruk. Is that it? Yes. His blood test shows an alcohol content of 0.02%. - So? - The amount of alcohol was not high. But there was some. So, either he had a drink earlier, or a small amount right before the accident. 0.02%. How much alcohol does that mean? As I said, it depends what he drank. We can't know for sure. Raki or beer, with food or without... But is it enough to cause an accident? That's what I'm trying to explain. If you're asking me about the legal aspects, I wouldn't know. - But you could use it in your favor. - What do you mean? If they sue about the death... What are you saying? Well, there'll be a court case, for sure. - We'll make our statement tomorrow. - Is Murat dead? Excuse me? Didn't you know? These questions about alcohol... What time did he pass? Why does it matter? Like, exactly when. What time did he die? He was checked in at 10:27 am. At 10:30 am, he went into surgery, and at 11:57 am, he passed. In the morning. Yes. He was in a critical condition when he came in. Show me Murat. But now... It's already hard to keep it a secret. If we go to the morgue now... Since it's confidential, you know. Take me to him. Who else knows about this? Where've you been, man? I was at Esma's. - This late? - Yeah. So, how was it? Good. It was good. What happened at the hospital, Kadir? Like I said, she didn't sign. Didn't sign, huh? Who's this relative? What does he do? Just some guy. Said he'd try to convince her. Try to convince. Try to convince. Empty words. Too late for anything. There's nothing we can do. What did you do? The orders won't be on time. I'll get them done. How can you? One of the machines is broken. We got it fixed. Got it fixed? - How did it get fixed? - What do you mean? They said not to touch it until tomorrow. We asked the insurance guy. He said OK. We asked the insurance guy? Is that what you'll say when they come in? "He said OK, so we did it"? I'll say whatever I want, Kadir. You do whatever the hell you want? - Do I need to ask you? - Yeah, you ask me. What the hell is this? The guy's injured and all you care about are the orders. You couldn't wait? - Would it kill you to wait? - What do I tell the clients? - "Just wait"? - Yes. That's not how it works. This is how it works? - This is business. - Fuck business! What the hell is with you? - You just began and you lecture me? - You bullshitter! You spread lies about the guy, you talk like we're all good guys. Tell me why you started that machine. What's going on here? - I got it fixed and now it's working. - Have you? - I fucking did it! - Halil... Why are you hiding this from me? Hiding what? I was at the hospital. I wanted to check if there was any alcohol in his blood. The man's dead. Since this morning. He died an hour and a half after we dropped him there. His wife and kid think he's alive. They think they'll see him tomorrow. How can you do this? Why did you hide this from me? What if we'd told you, Kadir? We wanted to protect you. Is this how you protect me? By sending me away? You'd have a clear conscience. What conscience are you talking about? Did we kill the man? He's dead. Is it our fault? No. He also drank. What difference does it make if the family finds out today or tomorrow? "What difference"? Is this legal, what you're doing? What are you talking about, Kadir? What law are you talking about, Kadir? If it's left to the law, we'd be guilty for no reason. The important thing is morals. Honestly, my conscience is clear. Did you also know about Murat's death? Did you? Of course. Morals. I'll keep it short. The lawyer will come with the documents in the morning. I spoke with your uncle, too. He'll deal with the legal issues in the US. You'll stay at their place at first. We'll figure out the rest later. OK? Everything's being arranged. I'm the last one to find out. I barely have any responsibilities at the factory. But I take the fall for the accident. You talk with my uncle without telling me. The documents are being drawn up. Kadir's just disposable, apparently. What are you talking about? You're just thinking about yourself. You're being selfish. I'm thinking about everyone. You, your brother, Zeynep, everyone. Put yourself in my shoes. What would you do? Kadir. No point in dragging this out. You'll leave tomorrow morning, once the documents are ready. In any case... as soon as things are resolved, you can come right back. Kadir. Are you OK? - Did something happen? - Esma... What happened? Do you love me? - Do you love me? - Yes. And do I love you? Are you asking me, Kadir? Do we trust each other? Do you believe in me? Yes, but where's this coming from? You're scaring me. I'm in big trouble. There was an accident at the factory. We took the man to the hospital, but... he died. When did this happen? Today. This morning. Kadir, why didn't you tell me earlier? I couldn't know. Things just got messy and blew up. I didn't want to upset you, not today. I wish you had. The worker's wife needs to sign a statement. If she doesn't, I'll have to go abroad. What are you saying, Kadir? Exactly that. What do you mean? What does it have to do with you? - It does. - How come? Tell me straight. One of the machines broke down. We asked the guy to fix it. He got burnt by steam while working on it. I don't get how that's your fault. Well, I'm responsible too. I actually saw the man after I left yours. From a distance. Later I found out he was drunk. If I'd gone and talked to him... - Maybe he'd be alive. - That means he's at fault, Kadir. - That's not confirmed yet. - OK, then just wait and see? My family doesn't want to take the risk. Now I won't stay, even if they ask me to. Why's that? Esma... Please... Let's leave together. We'll build a new life. What are you saying, Kadir? You can't just ask me to move abroad, like asking me out. You just met my family today. Just today. You haven't told your family about me. I don't even have a passport. Listen. You can get a passport in a day. I don't even know where you're going. Is it important, Esma? I'm asking for us to leave together. Let's go. To the US. I can go first, set everything up, then you follow me. What shall I tell my family, Kadir? They'll understand. You'll convince them somehow. What if I say no? Please don't, Esma. What would you do if I said no, Kadir? Mrs. Serpil... - Mr. Kadir, is everything OK? - May I come in? I have something to tell you. - We talked it out yesterday. - It's nothing to do with yesterday. Please, just hear me out. - We already... - Mrs. Serpil Please. Just listen. You needn't have. It's no trouble. How are you today? Better than yesterday? Thank God. I hope Mahmut didn't offend you. Not at all. He's very fond of his brother. Hearing about the accident, all of a sudden... - He blew up. I'm sorry. - No worries. I'm the one who's sorry. Coming to the hospital like that... That statement... Mr. Kadir, I won't sign that statement. Murat doesn't drink anyway. He quit. Just once in a while. When he's really down. That day, we had a little argument. I don't know. He probably didn't drink. He doesn't drink during the day anyway. Murat wouldn't have been drinking. Serpil... - Murat... - Mom! Where are you? What happened, Akif? Come. Come this way. Go in here. Play in here. I'll come soon. Sorry, Mr. Kadir. You were saying something. I was saying he probably hadn't been drinking. He hasn't been drinking, Mr. Kadir. He quit. Why would he drink during the day? He wouldn't have. You've been standing. Won't you sit down, please? You didn't eat. Thank you. I made it for the visitors coming to the hospital. Bless you. First plate is destined for you, apparently. At least have a bite. Have some, it's for a good deed. Murat really likes this. Once he gets better... Inshallah. Serpil... Don't sign the statement... but I insist you take this money. - Mr. Kadir... - Please, take the money. - Mr. Kadir, I don't want it. - Serpil, listen. I didn't come for the statement. - Please. - Why should I take it? You might need it. Mr. Kadir, why are you doing this? Serpil, think about Akif, his future. Mr. Kadir, thank you for coming. It was thoughtful of you. You seem like a good person. God bless you. Murat always said good things about your father. Since you want to do this, wait until Murat is discharged. Murat would surely accept it. There's no need to bother him with it. Talk to him then, Mr. Kadir. Talk to him about everything. I can't accept it alone. Come. Come. Easy. Little lower. To the right. Little lower. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
