After following my husband who likes to move between countries to work, I ended up stranded in Malaysia. In Kuala Lumpur to be exact. I have been living here for three months. MALAYSIA NEWS Dika, my husband, works as a consultant in an oil company. He doesn't need to go to an office to work. He works from home just wearing his pajamas all day. Sometimes he goes for a meeting at his client’s office. Every time we move, I have to adapt to the local customs. Morning, Miss Diana. - Hi, Diana. - Hi, Vivian. - Jog with me? - Next time, OK? OK, bye. Enjoy. - Yoo-hoo, Diana. - Hello, Siti, hi. What time will we have breakfast? I can't. I have a job interview. - Really? Thank God. - Thank God. Honey. I'm not the type who likes to sit about at home. I have been three months without a job and it's made me frustrated. My husband also prefers that I work, so I don't disturb him at home. Do you think I'm getting fatter? Do you honestly want me to answer you that? Nice try. What do you mean? Well, I... One. Two. Three. - Where are you going? Where you going? - Ouch! - It's hopeless. - What? Honey, honey. If something comes up, just call me. Don't forget to take in the clothes I hung out, and Ijah will be coming here at 9:00 a.m. OK? Today I will be having a job interview. I am so excited and I can't wait to go back to work. OK, bye. - Look at her now. - Hey, bye, you all. Hey, Diana. May you get the job. - Thank you. Bye. - Bye. Hey, why didn't she hang out with us? She has a job interview. Is her husband not working anymore? It feels different. We don't have enough people to gossip with anymore. Yes, that's right. Usually there are four of us gossiping. They say it's not good to do things with only three people. If only three people do things, the person in the middle will die. Yes. I think this will be an easy job experience. My prospective boss is also an Indonesian. He was my husband's old friend when they were studying in America. I've never met him, but as Indonesians, I think it'll be easy to deal with him. What? It doesn't make sense, you cannot do this to me. You know what? What? Delivering packages? No. No, no. - I will resign. - You cannot resign from being my lawyer. - Yes, I can. - No, you cannot. - Yes, I can. - Cannot. - Fine, then I will fire myself. - Thank you. Next. Miss Sandra. Please come in. Psst. Sikin, my dear, where did you go last night? I called but you didn't answer. I didn't go anywhere. Why? Ooh, you're so pretty. I know that we're meant to be together. Are you crazy? What did you say to me? "Even a monkey is smarter than you are." Ridiculous. You two? Good luck. Miss Patricia, please come in. Damn it! You think all I'm good for is to sell pork buns? Who do you think you are? Donald Trump? Your head may be similar, but your office is a rat hole! I don't feel too good now. Sikin! What did I eat that was so wrong this morning? What is this? Why did Adrian go home at five? Do you understand what I'm saying? No, I don't. That's why you have to eat nutritious food, Sikin. Don't eat cane bread every day. That means he finished work before five. Do you understand? Cut his salary. And here, Azhari. Why was he two minutes late like this? Huh? Why are people coming in late to work? I'm cutting his salary, OK? One minute late is a one-hour salary cut. Two minutes late is a two-hour salary cut. Sorry, I don't understand what you are saying. This salary cut refers to which paragraph? What are you saying? Is she asking for donations? Why did you let her in? In this office, they're not allowed to go in. Tell her to go. What's the point? No, sir. I came here to do an interview. Interview? No such thing. I am Dika's wife, sir. He said you needed an employee. - Are you really Dika's wife? - Of course, she is, boss. - Is it true? - True. - Certain? - Certain. Move over. - Are you sure? - I am. I asked her. Why do you keep answering? Of course, boss. She is Mr. Dika's wife. Miss Know-It-All, is Dika your husband? Is he? Is he? Is he? - Not here to collect donations? - No. Oh. NO ENTRY UNLESS ON BUSINESS Are you sure? Come in. Psst. BE PATIENT, DARLING Please forgive me, I completely forgot about this. I usually meet with important people. I don't mean to say you're not important, but I only remember important things. I remember Dika showing me your photo once, but you were so fat then. That's why I didn't recognize you. OK, do you understand what your job is? Huh? So, you will be appointed as Head of Administration. Here in Malaysia, it's called Head of Kerani. What was it again? Come on, say it. - Ke... - Ke... - Ra... - Ra... It's not "Kera". There is a "Ni" at the end of the word. If I think about it, I'm quite funny. OK, seriously now. So, you will be in charge of all the employees here. My business is so big. I have an iron export-import business, heavy equipment, and also spare parts for cars. Car workshops, many of them. Everything is here. I have business in Indonesia and Singapore. Why are you quiet? You must be in shock? You're admiring me now, aren't you? I'm used to having people admiring me. - You can call me Bossman. - Yes, sir. Bossman. - OK. - OK. Hey, where are you going? - I'm not finished yet. - Oh? Why are you in a hurry? Wait just a minute. Do you know that I lived in California for 13 years? Do you know where California is? America. Back then, in California, was the first time I met Dika. If you'd seen your husband then, oh my goodness. He was so geeky, tacky... Why does he keep on talking? God, please make him choke on his own tonsils so that he will stop talking. In California, me and my whole family lived in a huge bungalow. None of my family was unsuccessful, they're all successful. This is the proof of my success, see? Isn't it amazing? You must be in shock now. A symbol of success. Hey, hey, don't be shock. I think this person has a screw loose. Do I even care whether he has lived in America or the North Pole? Please. - Something to tell me? - Huh? I'm very busy right now, if you don't. So, if you can, go home now and come to work tomorrow. Actually, at first Dika didn't want me to work with his friend, because he was worried that if something happened, their friendship could be affected. But I was persistent. Fine. How was it? Is he a bit crazy? - That's just how he is. - Yes, I know, but... How to say it? He was a bit weird. A bit annoying. That's exactly how he is. And also, he never thinks before he speaks. He just keeps on talking. By the way, he said you were geeky. That's how he is. What's wrong with you? You keep saying that over and over. Well, that's really just how he is. This seems like a bad sign. I should have escaped when I saw his lawyer fire himself from that company. Good morning. Morning. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you, too. Sis, you have to do all these files today. Bossman wants to look for a new supplier. All the old suppliers are in these files. This is your desk. This one? Why do you look like you have seen a ghost? Those files are written financial reports, not computerized. Our boss doesn't allow us to use computers. - Why? - He just likes to do it. If we do it in writing, it will show when we revise. That way he'll know if we cheat him, understand? Hmm... Is that a new perfume? I know, I'm getting drunk on your love. - It's against our religion to get drunk. - Oh, sorry. Kerani! Kerani! Kerani. Kera... Ni! Miss Kerani! Hello! Where are you? Hello? Hello? Kerani, Kerani, Kerani, Kerani. - Yes? - Give me the Hong Kong file. - OK, sir. - Hey, write it down. File, Hong Kong. - File, Hong Kong. - Write it down first. - Yes. - What was it? - The Hong Kong file, right? - The Hong Kong file. Remember that. - The Hong Kong file. - Yes. OK. Sikin, the boss asked for the Hong Kong file. Do you know that file? I'm busy now. Don't disturb me. I'm busy, don't disturb me. Can't you see? We have no money now. You were asking for the Hong Kong file just now. Oh, yes, just put it there. - I'm putting it here, OK, sir? - Yes. Hey, Kerani! Please look through that file and read those files to me. Open it! I have the data in my laptop, but I'm busy right now. Search there. How much was the total production cost? The total was... Oh, here it is. - Five... - I got it. Does that include the delivery fee to Malaysia? - Delivery fee to Malaysia. - Found it! Who gave the presentation? - Their name is... - Found it. - What's the address? - The address... Got that. What's his phone number? - Eight... Eight... - Found it. I found it. Here, our company is on an international scale, so you have to know how to handle them professionally. Hey, what is this? Raj, why are you looking so messy? Take a shower, Raj. You look so dirty, like a sewer rat. What a mess. Remind him, he has to take a shower. Take a shower at home, not here. Water is expensive here. Got it? What do you mean? Is that also my job? This is Diana, our new Head of Kerani. From now on, she will be... - What is he saying? - No idea. I never know. Keep nodding. He'll think we get it. - OK. Sure thing. - ...supervising production activity. I think his mustache looks strange. As strange as the person. And if there is a customer who is complaining, then complain to her. OK? Not to me, OK? Who is that woman? His second wife, maybe. Introduce yourselves one by one. Starting from you. Yes, you. Why are you looking so confused? What is this? Your name. One, one, one, one. Talk. You have to supervise them thoroughly. Be frugal. Supervise them very thoroughly, because sometimes they are lazy and they cheat. So, don't be nice to them. If you know that, why employ them? Why, what's wrong with that? Huh? Do you want to pay the salary of a Harvard graduate? Miss Know-It-All. You just started working here. Don't be an idiot. Police! Police! Police! Run! Hide! Mr. Chia, what's happening? Uh... they're immigration officers... They're busting illegal workers. This is normal. No need to panic. Hey, you can't hide in there. My gut feeling told me this would be my worst nightmare. Phone. Hello? - Hello, hello? - Hello? - Hello, hello, hello. Hello. - Hello? Who is this? Why are you calling so early in the morning? - Hey, it's your boss calling. - Huh? Bossman? Of course! Do you think it's Brad Pitt? You wish... Yeah, what is it, sir? Why are you calling so early? - What are you doing right now? - Playing ice skating. At two o'clock in the morning? - Why aren't you sleeping? - You know it's two o'clock. - Of course I was sleeping. - I called because of something important. If not, why would I be wasting my phone credit on you? What are you doing? Are you doing something with Dika? Doing something? Hey, next time when I call, don't take too long. Be quick. Yeah, yeah. What do you need, sir? So, it's like this. Grab a pen and paper first, and write down. Remember, write it down. This is important. Tomorrow, I'm planning to have a meeting at nine. At nine o'clock sharp. Sir, my working hours start at eight. So, before nine I will be at the office. You don't have to call me in the a.m.'s like this. What? Why are you telling me off? Huh? It's my company. My office. Just remember, we will have a meeting at nine tomorrow. This is an important information. I have to tell you that now, no delaying. Hey, have you written it down? Ah, now I forgot what I was gonna say. Damn it! Calm down, honey. That's just how he is. Honey, shut up! In this company, I not only have to deal with the behavior of the boss, but also the employees. Good morning, everyone! How are you today? You don't have to answer, I'm sure everyone is OK. Takes too long if I ask you one by one. OK, so the reason why I gathered all of you here this morning is that I want to tell you something important. Malay, please. Or English, if you please. If you speak Bahasa Indonesian like this, only you, Kerani and maybe God will understand. We don't. We don't understand you. You're so noisy, you know? Do you realize you're noisy? Do you think I can't speak English? I lived in the US for 13 years, remember? OK! So... I want to buy... a new factory. Big factory. So, are we shifting to a new factory? - Yes! Marvelous. - Where? Not yet know. You don't know where the factory is? I don't know yet. I was just dreaming of it. Wait, wait, wait. He woke me up at two o'clock in the morning just to tell me about his dream? Am I dreaming or what? So, you called us in for a meeting in which you choose to come late two hours to tell us your dream about buying this factory in an unknown location? What is his problem with me? Why is he so emotional? Does he have a problem with me? Is there anything wrong with a dream? It was my dream. Why does it have to be a problem? This is why none of you are rich like me. You don't dare to dream, so you can't move forward. This is the most absurd and unqualified meeting I have ever had in my entire life. OK. I haven't worked with my boss long, but I've already come to the conclusion that my boss is a bit crazy. Working here is like going back to ancient times. Save our time. This you, break it apart. Like this. There. Break it apart. Bossman has lived in Malaysia over 10 years, but he always speaks like he's from another planet, and no one here can understand. This one is a bit difficult, but still... ...pull it apart. Sir, speak in English or Malay. They don't understand. Why are you telling me what to do? I know them better than you. Be quiet. Continue. This is a company that has no clear rules or working system. Even an international-caliber consultant would never be able to fix it. Because the source of all this chaos is none other than... The roof is leaking. If it gets into the machine, the machine will be broken, right? I told you before that the roof was leaking and there were many holes, but you wouldn't listen to me. You can fix it. It's not my job to repair a leaky roof. My job is to watch the machine. So, is it my job? Is it my job to do the repairs? You're being disrespectful. This is also because of you. Why are the repairs not finished yet? Yesterday, you told them to stop and fix your in-law's car. But because of that, that happened here. Don't complain to me. You arranged everything. So, who can I complain to, then? Myself, huh? To whom should I complain to? To the devil? In this company, complaining to the boss is a waste of energy, because the number one rule here is that Bossman is always right. I haven't been working with my boss long, but I already know he is absent-minded. Every time I tell him things, his response is only, "Ah, ah, mm." "OK, OK. Just fix it." AKA, stage four deafness. - Sir. - Hmm? Sir, we haven't paid the electricity bill or the Internet bill. We have to pay by end of month, or they will cut off services. - We are way overdue now, sir. - Hmm. - Sir. - Hmm? So, what about those bills? And if the Catfish Mustache is looking at his laptop seriously, that doesn't mean he's working. He could be browsing Indonesian celebrities, which is his hobby. Cool. Why is the Internet down? I need to send an email to a client. It has been four days since they cut off the Internet. We didn't pay the bill, sir. I put the bill on your desk, and you just said, "Yes," at the time. You are so clever at making excuses. Are you making that up? Do you have any witnesses? After knowing him, I now believe that amnesia does exist. CHRONIC AMNESIA I have never had a boss who was as stingy as the Catfish Mustache. His principal is: He will do anything for the company as long as it doesn't cost him money. The AC is broken. We have to buy a new one. It's old already. Don't count on it, Mr. Kho. He doesn't even want to pay for the water. Hey. Don't comment. Who asked you for your opinion? What do you mean "broken"? Are you saying the AC is not working? - Tell Bedul to fix it. - What? Bedul, Bedul can fix it. There is no justification of buying a new air-con if we can still fix it. It cannot be fixed. It is too old. Ah, so it's old. As old as Mr. Kho, eh? Oh, yes. If we want to save money, how about buying a second-hand air-con, boss? I know a place that sell it at a special price. Does the store belong to your relative? Grandfather? Grandmother? In-laws? What are you saying? I don't understand. If you have a good idea for the company, keep it to yourself. Because Bossman is always suspicious of our good intentions. Whatever your suggestion is, you want to steal his money. Is it your side job? Oh, yes. Hey. Mr. Kho! I've been thinking... The empty space behind the factory, it's a bit of a waste if we don't use it. It's empty, so I plan to build an office there. What do you think? I want to hear your opinions one by one, starting with Kerani. Are you sure you want to hear our opinions? Of course. I am a democratic person. Do you think I'm Kim Jong Un? Huh? So? OK, then. In my opinion, an office should be located at the front, not the back, and that's not to mention we'd have to walk through the trash to get there. Yes, it's embarrassing if we have guests coming over. Hmm. That place stinks, boss. And I also heard that place use to be a grave yard. Even according to feng shui, the front is better than the back. Hmm. OK, then, good. All your opinions are wonderful. Amazing. So, we have a decision. We have agreed to build the office behind the factory. Thank you, everyone, for your opinions. I really appreciate it. OK. It seems Bossman learned his management skill from North Korean regime leader Kim Jong Un. In this narrow room that looks like a chicken coop, we, the employees, use to talk. Cursing to be exact. Imagine how tormented we were. Miserable. Sis, you have to know that our boss is so stingy. Oh my God, as if he's going to die. I think if his armpit hair were stuck on our finger, he'd ask us to pay for it. Hey, hey, hey. Forgive me, God. I didn't want to bad-mouth him, you know, but there's a reason he's so rich. - Peace be upon you, boss. - Peace be upon you, too. - Boss, can I ask you something? - Hmm. Why did you cut my salary? You used company water to wash the car, right? I've told you. Don't use the company's facilities for personal use. What? I don't understand. You used water here to wash the car the other day, right? Good Lord. - I was cleaning the company car, right? - Yeah. Yes. I was cleaning it because it was dirty, but my salary was cut instead. I don't understand what he says. He talks like an alien. Sikin! You scribbled here on the royalty's document. This is tax-related. Important. Why weren't you careful? Look. You're not supposed to scribble here. What are you saying? This is so complicated. Why can't you understand? Silly. He is a troublemaker indeed. That was why I always go alone to do sales. But he doesn't believe me and wants to come along. - You cannot follow me in. - Why? - It's the prime minister's office. - I'm the boss. Yes, yes. We know you're the boss. You can tell the whole world, or CNN that you're the boss. But you still have to register. No name, no entry. Enough. You know? They wait for me. Inside. I am a Malaysian citizen and I had to wait two years to get the pass. OK, you cannot go in. Why can't I go inside? Why? I am still related to Tan Sri Abdul Walid Kamarudin... Ah. Time's up. If you want to know what I think, he may be rich but he was so tacky. Every time he goes out to purchase the tools, he is so embarrassing when it comes to bargaining. Oh my God. One box is 90 ringgit, minimum purchase ten boxes. What? I have to pay 90 ringgits for ten boxes? Is this how you sell? Who'll buy your tools if this is how sell? Does this Shaolin grandpa want to trick us or what? What? Trickery? Don't come here if you don't want to buy. Don't talk recklessly. If you don't want to buy, get out! Go and find another store you wish. Don't act out if you don't have money. Watch your mouth. Look at me and how I'm dressed? Can't you see the rings? My suit was sewn at the tailors and it's very expensive. Hello, my dear wife. Hello, my dear husband. Madam Boss, Bossman's wife. - Yes, honey. - Oh... In this world, only she can make Bossman subdued and a bit tamed. Maybe because his wife is the reason they are rich, and she has always supported Catfish Mustache's businesses. - Honey? - I want the single-seater. The double-seater. I want everything. With this table too. OK? Anything else? - Hello? - Hold on, hold on. Yes, honey? - Furniture shopping again? - Yes. This is the second time this month. We live in a house, not a showroom, you know? What you spend on furniture shopping could be used to feed the people of Africa for two years, honey. You can't talk like that. Africans don't eat furniture. By the way, I was calling you to remind you that we will have dinner tonight, right? Don't forget, OK? I have been preparing a special dish. You will like it. Russian food. A Russian dish? Bossman gets afraid when his wife cooks. He will find million excuses to avoid eating his wife's terrible cooking. Hold on, dear. Oh, no. My wife wants to cook Russian food. What do I do now? This is a mess. What to do now? Why aren't you answering? What to do now? Hello, dear, it's... So... um... I... Uh... Today's Mr. Koh's birthday. So, me and the staff at work will be having dinner tonight. So, you don't have to cook, OK? That's perfect, dear. Then bring all the staff to have dinner at our house to celebrate Mr. Kho's birthday and taste my Russian food. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Mr. Kho, now blow the candle. Come on. One, two, three. - Hurray. - Happy birthday, Mr. Kho. Come on, try to smile. Come on everybody, eat. Come on eat everybody. Eat. I only just recently started trying to cook Russian food. Come on, honey. Taste it. I was just about to, honey. Hmm? Hmm? How was it? Good? Very good? I am so happy you like my cooking. If there is one thing Bossman and I agree on, it's his wife's terrible cooking. And I hated it for sure so much that he got us into this mess. - Yeah. - I'm so happy. - Even the gun powder is perfect. - Gun powder? The spiciness is good. Oh. Because I know you like spicy food, that's why I made it a bit spicy. Well, everyone, try it, too. Come on, eat it. Dear God, it's getting hotter every day here in the office. We are like cookies being baked here. Sis, please tell the boss to buy a new air-con. This one is old and broken already. That's right. He won't listen to us if we talk. You're the Head of Kerani, please talk to him. Besides, we don't understand his weird language. I can't sleep in this heat. It's hot... Prepare your notepad. Prepare it. Hurry up, before I forget. - Come on, take a note. - Yes, OK. I'm ready now. - This is about Amir. - Which Amir? That Amir... Sikin, what was his name, Amir something? Boss, Amir is no longer working with us. Sis, Amir was our Bangladeshi worker, and he has returned to Bangladesh. - Ah. - That one. Please. What was I gonna say? You always cut my speech, and now I forgot what I was gonna say because of you. Oh, yes, I remember. This Amir, persuade him to work with us again. Persuade him nicely. Don't talk to him fiercely. OK? Here's how you do it. Hello. Amir. Mir. Right now... we have a lot of export work, and everyone is busy here. Can you come back here? Hello? What do you say? So, can you come back? You can? Before the end of the month, OK? How should I know? I am not Amir. Everyone, get to work. Don't pretend to work. Come with me to the customs office. People here calling it customs. We have a lot of imported goods. If we had a shortcut from customs, that would be nice. Direct approach. I prefer the fast way. Look, the car is new. You've never seen one like it, have you? It's expensive. It's not every day you can ride in this car. I was just worried you would throw up in this car. Don't throw up, OK? Ow... What's wrong with you? Sore muscles? Your sore muscles will disappear when you ride this car. Clean your shoes first before you get in. I'm afraid my car will get dirty. Come on. Why are you driving so slowly? Can't you drive faster? Don't be so lame. Ah, yeah, don't forget. I plan to have lunch with the people from customs. I'll take them to the most expensive restaurant in KL. Don't embarrass me, OK? You've never eaten at an expensive restaurant, right? Don't take selfies and upload them on Facebook. And please order a cheap drink, not an expensive one. This is a company expense, so don't waste too much money. Remember that. What's wrong? Keep your eyes on the road. Don't tell me where to look. I can look at you, the back or the side, it's safe. There is nothing here. Sir! I think this person got his license by bribe. So lame. - You hit his car. - He hit us. His bumper hit the front of my car. - Sir, what are we going to do now? - What? Don't panic. Just calm down. He looks angry. What are we going to do, sir? - Get out! - Sir? He's angry. You think this is your grandma's road? - Sir, he's angry. - Get out of the car! - Sir. Wake up. What's wrong with you? - Come on, get out! Get out before I break your car into pieces. Sorry. - What's wrong with him? - I don't know. - Suddenly he just passed out. - Passed out? Hey. Hello, don't make drama here, OK? Wake up, wake up! Oh my God. - Is he dead? - Huh? - I think it's a heart attack. - Heart attack? Is he your husband? - No, he's my boss. - Boss? I think you better call an ambulance. And bury him as soon as possible. Psst. Psst. - What? - What? Is he gone yet? - Yes, he has. - Good. I don't understand why he was so angry. He was in the wrong, but he was the one getting angry. Annoying! Don't forget OK? How can I go there and talk to them? Just go there and talk to them. Aren't you having a meeting with them? I just know that they always eat here. Huh? What do you mean? You don't have an appointment with them? Don't look at me like that. Just don't! You think it's easy to make appointment? They are all anti-corruption people. We have to be careful. Fine, I will go to them. No, no sir. Please don't. It's embarrassing. Don't go there. If shame stops us, how can we move forward? Sir. Good afternoon, gentlemen. May I sit here? May I? Let's have a chat and get to know each other. It's better than just the four of you talking. It was quiet, right? All right, yes. So, how is the food? Is it good? The service here is good, right? Everything is OK, right? They haven't delivered our order. Oh... that's OK. Don't worry, I will pay for your food. Hold on a second. Who are you? Are you the owner of this restaurant? No. I'm a businessman. I have a lot of business. And I met you gentlemen and lady here by chance so that it would look like I can afford to pay the taxes. If there is a... You understand of course, don't you? The short cut... Smooth-sailing. OK, the food is here. Wow. There's a lot. Wow, that's a big portion. Can you eat it all by yourselves? I couldn't. Wow, you ordered a lot of food. Wow, you, too, ma'am. Can your stomach store all that food? Please eat. Go ahead. - What are you looking at? - Is she your wife? No! How can she be my wife? That weird-looking woman with the weird hair. I don't want to. And not to mention she's so fierce. - Your bill, sir. - Give it to me. There. Don't worry, I will pay for your food. Why are you paying for our food? We were the ones eating the food, so we're going to pay for it. We don't even know who you are. What do you want? Sir, it doesn't matter if I pay for it. It's OK for me to pay for your food. And after this, we will arrange an appointment for a meeting. We'll talk about... About money. This. What I was talking about earlier... Right, I have money for the cost of import customs. We are not allowing this kind of thing here, sir. We can't do this. - We are bound by the law. - We can. - We can't. - We can. - We can't. - We can. Seriously. Everything is arrangeable. "Atur-able." Do you know what "atur-able"means? I created it. Sorry, sir. Your card was declined. Really. What happened? I'm not sure, sir. But your card is definitely declined. Are you sure? OK, then. Kerani... What are you doing there? I don't understand credit cards. - What are you doing there? - Huh? No. I was just... Oh. She thought she dropped her spoon. All right, then, I will pay in cash, can I? - How much was that? - It was 1550 ringgit. How much is that if the bill was split in four? I don't have that much cash with me. I will pay for the tip first, then. Don't count this as a payment. This is just the tip. Gentlemen, I will go to the ATM to withdraw the money. Please don't go anywhere and wait for me here. Promise me, OK? I will be back. ♪ I thought ♪ ♪ It would be a long summer ♪ ♪ It turns out ♪ ♪ The rain has come ♪ ♪ Inviting ♪ ♪ You were so happy to say ♪ Hello? What the... Did I leave you there? I am now on my way home. I forgot. Huh? What do you mean? What about the payment? And you left me all alone here? No, I was on my way to the ATM, and then my wife called me and I completely forgot about it. So, what am I going to do now? How will I pay for the food? I didn't bring any cash with me, sir. Not even petty cash. Why are you getting angry over petty things? Just send the bill to the office. How? Do you think this is a hotel that can send out bills? - That can't be done. - Then... let those customs people pay for their own food. They were the one eating. Why do I have to pay for it? They don't want to have an appointment, but they want me to pay? They ate so much. Are they eating an elephant? - All right, I'm driving now, bye. - Sir? - Sir, sir! - Bye! Your friend, Catfish Mustache, the sack of bald head and minced hairs, I'm sure there's no one like him in this world. His brain is only a thin line, just like his mustache. That's just how he is. You know what? I'll make a Molotov bomb and I will throw it into his office. - And you cannot stop me. - I'm not trying to stop you. But, honey. I just want to talk to you. So, sit. Let me talk to you. Good girl. I don't want to interfere in your business with him. He is my best friend. I do enjoy his craziness, the way that he is. And you are... somehow... eventually my wife. So... I don't want to interfere, with you two, and I can't do it. But if you could handle me, you can handle him. Easy, just like that. Taking care of a camel is easier than him. Sir, come on, hurry up. It's time to go home. I have a date with my husband. Why are you in such a hurry? Where are you going? Tomorrow is the weekend, so it's a holiday. Is Sophia Latjuba going to get married again? So? Hasn't she been married before? - Who was her husband? - How should I know? You like to keep yourself updated on Indonesian celebrity gossip. - You like infotainment. - I really don't know. Sophia didn't tell me anything. You should fix your debt to your suppliers instead of looking at that gossip. - You haven't paid anything. - You were always like that. Are you jealous if I get close to Indonesian celebrities? Hey, where are you going? Home, sir. It's time to go home. Sit down. This afternoon, my wife was asking for 1000 ringgit in petty cash, right? Let me give you the 200 first. One hundred, two hundred. Please count that. Is it the right amount? - How much is that? - There are only two sheets, sir. - Well, how much was that? - Two hundred. The rest of the money, the 800, I will give you in under ten ringgit notes. Ten, twenty, thirty... Actually, I'm already tired of dealing with Catfish Mustache. But because I am a foreigner, I work on a contract. And if one party severs the contract before its time, that party has to pay the remaining working time to the other party. I don't want to resign and pay the remaining contract time to him. I was hoping he'd fire me. But that super stingy person will never fire me and pay the remaining money to me. So, moral of the story is, I will be stuck with this stupid Catfish Mustache until my contract time is up. Where was I, was it 600? Why was I going back to 500? I think I was up to 600. I have to count it from the beginning. I made a mistake. This is wrong! Tsk. I need to get rid of this. Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty... CAFÉ AND RESTAURANT Uh... Honey? Uh... They're dead already. You don't have to kill them. You know what? I really, really, really hate him. I think he has woken my inner serial killer. You're pointing your knife at me. Why don't we just point it back to your plate? Now I'm safe. Honey. Is it possible that we not talk about him tonight, because I really feel that he has already become one of our family members. Believe me, that is not the picture I want in my head, so can we just stick with our dinner, and have a good time? OK, OK. Thank you. It's OK. - Hmm... - Honey. Do you know where I can learn to build a Molotov bomb? I want to learn. Brother, I really do like Sikin. Brother, as a fellow Muslims, I want to tell you, learn how to deal with a broken heart. "Broken heart" is not in my dictionary, bro. She just acts as if she doesn't like me, but actually, she likes the attention. That's lesson number one. Learn it. The apple of my eye. Are you busy now? Uh... No, I'm not busy. I'm very relaxed now, at the beach. You naughty girl. Kerani. He wants us to deliver the iron door for Mr. Cheng's swallows to Johor Baru? What? The iron door that is going to be delivered into the forest? Mr. Kho, it's been two months I've been looking for a transporter to deliver that iron door into the forest. No one is willing to do it. He wants us to deliver that iron door. We can't do it, sir. It's impossible. It's inaccessible. Even Mr. Cheng's workers walked or rode a bicycle to get there. Why are you saying it's impossible? For me... Everything is possible. ♪ You have asked ♪ ♪ For separation ♪ ♪ I thought you were only joking ♪ ♪ Ah ♪ - You should have gone right. - Straight. According to the map, - you should've turned right then. - Straight, I want to drive straight. - What do you mean? - Just go straight. Sir, according to the map, you turn right. Straight. You be quiet. - Turn right, sir. - Turn... Enough. Dead end? Ow. Why didn't you just do what Mr. Kho said. Now we're lost in an unknown place. We have spent hours and we ended up here. Why did I even have to come along? I'm useless here. Enough! I want to prove it to you. We can do even impossible things. It's getting late. It will be dark soon. - What if there's a ghost? - You're scared of them? Just undress yourself and get naked. The ghost will be afraid of you. Of course they'd be afraid, seeing you naked. People are afraid even when you're dressed. Hey. Listen to me. Impossible we do. - Miracle? - We try. Hey, wake up! If you snore, I will smack your head. Wake up, Mr. Kho! Oh my God! Our struggle starts here, all right? We've been struggling since the beginning. Hey, hey, hurry up! Come on, move it, move it! - Come on! - Let's go. Go. What is this? Why is it so hard to walk through the forest? Darn it! Come on! Wild boar! Run! Wild boar! It's raining. Wait, wait, wait! Let me tell you, we're finally here, right? We can do it, can't we? And why did that boar follow us anyway? Even a boar was angry at you. Because you were so annoying. - Sir! - Eh? That's him! See, we made it, didn't we? We found the place, right? Impossible we do. Miracle we try. Keep walking. You still look stunning. Here's milk. If we kidnap someone here, put them in a sack... and then throw him out from the top of the building, will we go to prison? OK. Honey. OK, honey. I will show you how to deal with him. It's easy. OK? Now you can just relax. Relax. It is all about a mental game. Who wins this mental game is mentally strong, and the one who loses the game is crazy. You don't want to be crazy, right? - You want to win this, right? - Yes. - You want to face him. - Yes. He's right there. He's right there. Can't you see? He's right there. He's in front of you. You want to face him. You want to deal with him. - Yes. - You want to break through these problems. - All this mess. - Yes. You can deal with this. If you can do this, you can do anything. - Yes. - That's why I married you. That's why you're my wife. You were born as a champion. What are you, baby? - Champion! - What are you? I cannot hear you. - Champion! - Louder, baby. You are a champion. Let me see your hand. There you go. - You're a... - Champion! - You're a... - Champion! Champion! Fine, Catfish Mustache, this is payback time. We'll see who has the greatest mental strength here. Right this minute, I am declaring that a war has been started. Kerani, Kerani, Kerani! Kerani, Kerani, Kerani! Kerani! What are you doing? Why aren't you answering? Hey! Answer me when I call you! I want to expand my business to Europe, Daddy. No need. One business is enough. But it has to be solid. You are not a good businessman if none of your company is solid. Come on, Daddy. I'm a better businessman than you are. If you are better businessman than anyone, than why my daughter keep asking me for money to invest more in your business? I have a meeting today, don't I? - No, you don't. - I do. No, sir. You are free until five o'clock. - I do have a meeting. - No, you don't. Maybe you forgot. Have another look. - No, you don't have a meeting, sir. - Yes, I do. Look again. See? No meeting, sir. I don't have a meeting, eh? I think I do, right? I'm confident, sure, and certain. You have no meeting, sir. Daddy, sometimes she forgets. I should have a meeting today. Wow, what is this that I see? Who are you calling? Bossman. It's early in the morning in New York. He'll be sleeping. That is why I'm calling. Catfish Mustache often calls me early for unimportant matters. I'll get him back now. - Hello. - Hello, sir. We ran out of hydraulic oil, and we have no petty cash left. We'll need it for tonight, but there's no money. What should we do now, sir? We will talk about this again tomorrow. - I am so sleepy right now. - Sir. Sir, we have no more goods left in the showroom. What should we do, sir? What? What? - What? - Pants, pants, pants. What pants? What's wrong with my pants? And also, the shipper asked for payment. They said they will not ship the packages before they get the payment. But, we'll need them for tonight. What should we do, sir? Sir, sir, sir? - Sir? - What? What are you talking about? I am still sleeping right now. You keep disturbing my sleep. I don't know what you mean. You're so annoying. I'm hanging up now. Mr. Acang called earlier. He says he will not send the goods if we haven't paid. But we've run out of pistons. What should we do now, sir? Can you let me have a peaceful sleep, and stop disturbing me? Do you know what time is it now? This is New York, not Bekasi. What's wrong with you? I will lose my hair if this keeps up. - And I'll be bald. - Well. You shouldn't be angry at me, sir. This is company business. So, it must be important. Enough! Important. Honey. Are you OK? Honey, are you all right? OK. Did you finally kill him? - Almost, almost. - Almost. Almost. Oh, thank God. Oh, no. So, that was this close. Hey, if Koh Alung comes here, tell him I'm not here. - Sir... - Tell him I'm out of town. - You're too late. - Why do you say that? I already told him you were here. Huh? I told you already to not tell him I'm here, didn't I? - Well, what should I do, sir? - But I don't want to meet him. But I already told him that. He is getting impatient about the money you've owed him for the last eight months. What's wrong anyway, sir? Why are you so afraid of Mr. Alung? Don't talk too carelessly. Who is afraid of him? I'm not afraid of him. Why should I be afraid if he comes here? He can even bring 100 men here. OK. Mr. Alung, my boss is ready to meet you. He was here all this time? What's wrong with you? Hey, hey. Koh Alung, my old friend, is here already. How are you today? Dear God, you look healthier nowadays. And your hair is amazing. I'll get the money now, OK, Koh Alung? What happened, sir? Hmm... I've just been thinking. I've been feeling lately that you dislike me. Really? Maybe you're overthinking it. Tsk. Don't pretend you don't know. I am a sensitive person, I'll have you know. Come on, sir. Get to the point. What is the problem? I have a lot of work to do. If I don't do my job, you will get angry with me. Why me? It's you. What's your problem with me. Huh? Speak honestly, from the bottom of your heart. Well, sir, if we're talking about problems, it's not just me. All employees at your company have a problem with you. What? What are you saying? All the employees have a problem with me? What is their problem? As a boss, I think I'm quite nurturing. As a boss, I am very understanding to all my employees. Then where am I lacking? What? Do I lack compassion? Are you sure you want to know where you are lacking? Really? Enough, enough! If you keep on talking, when will you work? I am busy right now. OK. I am very satisfied to have given that Catfish Mustache some payback, and to have made him fall apart. Take that! Does it feel good? Dika is panicking now that I will surely throw a Molotov bomb into his best friend's room. If I have to do it, why not? I hope Bossman will have had enough of it and will fire me. That way, I can be free from that chicken coop, plus get the money for my remaining contract time. Now we will see, who is the mentally strongest here? Uh... Wait, wait, wait. What kind of mental war are you talking about here, honey? The kind that I want. Right, the kind that you want. No, that's not right. That's wrong. I did not teach you that. That's not the kind of mental war I'm talking about. Hmm... As I recall, I gave you money before I went to New York. It was 2000 ringgit, right? Mm, you gave me 300, sir. - Two thousand. - Three hundred. But here in my notes, I wrote 2000. It was 300, sir. - Really? - Yes, I wrote everything in the report. Ah, yeah, I gave you 1000 first, and then 500, and then 200, and then last time, before I went to New York, I gave you 300. - Yes. - Oh, yes, that wasn't in my notes. I wrote 2000 in my notes. - I wrote everything in my notebook, sir. - Where is it? There, you're holding it. Oh, that's why. You shouldn't write these separately like this. Just write down accumulative, 2000. How should I know you meant to give me 2000, sir? The point is, I wrote down all the money that you gave me, and all money used. Everything is there. Whatever you say, my point is, your record and mine is different. That's what I mean. Then just change your record, sir. I don't want to change mine. Can't you just do that? You used to work in a multinational company. There was a program we used when I was working there. We used an application system, we didn't write it down like this. Written records are better. Then you will not be able to misuse the company's money again. I have a principle, which is not to trust anyone. If anyone is being corrupt with company money, I'll go to the police. Did you just accuse me of stealing company money? - Don't just accuse randomly, prove it! - Please calm down when you're talking. I was mistaken. You weren't wrong. Just calm down and sit down. Good Lord. What is happening again in this office? I clearly heard you say I would not be able to misuse the company's money again. Again you said. Again. When have I ever done that? OK, OK. Please speak calmly and stop yelling. - I will get older if you keep doing this. - Let me be clear. Rather than accusing me of stealing company money, you should pay my salary you haven't paid for two months. Why are you bringing up salaries now? I already told you, right? Call my wife and borrow some money from her. Why should I borrow money from your wife? - You owe me my salary, sir. - Please speak calmly. Relax. Don't be angry and don't yell all the time. I'm getting a headache. If you want, call the auditors or the police. I'm not afraid. Kerani, Kerani. Kerani... Kerani. That's good, come back. Don't be angry. Don't sulk, OK? Who is coming back? I just want to grab my bag. Kerani. Honey. I know people like him sometimes speak without thinking. That's why I'm sure he didn't mean to accuse you or treat you that badly. What do you mean he didn't mean that? He was clearly accusing me. I'm offended and I don't want to meet him anymore. Najong. Najong? What does "najong" mean? - And if needed... - Yes? I'll report him so he learns his lesson! - No, you don't want to. - Why? Just because he's your friend, you're defending him? - I wasn't trying to. - Aren't you? Just defend him, OK? - No, no. - Defend him! No, I wasn't taking his side or yours. I'm not taking anyone's side. I just wanted to say that his character is just like that. Enough! I don't want anything to do with him anymore. I'm going to resign from the company. Hey... Honey, you're gonna quit? If in the end, I decide to quit my job at that company, it doesn't mean I lose. It's because that Catfish Mustache has been stepping on my pride And if he asks for payment of the penalty, then I will sue him until the end of the world. - Why are you turning it off? - That's an old cassette player. Yeah. - Was that noisy? - Sorry. Sorry, did we wake you? I thought you were sleeping. We were about to eat, but upon hearing our favorite song. He was starving. I feed him. Yes. About yesterday, I apologize. Please, don't take it to heart. Never mind, go back to bed. I'm sorry. I'll see you at the office tomorrow, OK? - My heart is beating so fast. - It's good. You handled her very well. Really? She was so fierce. Where did you meet her? - Delicious. Who cooked it? - Me. You never cooked, back then. You were so geeky then. - Delicious, right? - So delicious. This is food. - That's a mosquito racket. - What do you want? - Don't use that on me. - Go away! - Hey! - No, no! Not here. - I can't run... - Go away! - I have no energy left now. - Go away! - There's must be another way. - Get lost! - Go away! - Yes, yes. Don't hit me with that. OK, I'll see you tomorrow at work, OK? Yes, here, don't forget tomorrow. Honey... Don't you "honey" me! You will sleep outside tonight. What? Honey? Can I at least have my pillow, please? Psst. What? What? - The food, please wrap it. - Ah, OK. I will wrap it. Sit down. No need. - Your wife is so fierce, dear Lord. - I suffered. - My gosh. - I'm sorry. - OK, thank you. My drink... - Drink. OK, take care. Don't forget to persuade her to come tomorrow. - Thank you again. - Yeah, bye. Take care. Uh... Mosquitoes. Mosquitoes. Oh. They're everywhere. Look at... Ooh, right there. Oh. Right there. There. In Islam, the husband should work, not the wife. - Goodness, Lord. - I agree, poor Diana. - That isn't true. - She works grueling hours. Hey, Diana Diana, aren't you going to work today? Have you quit your job? My boss is crazy, you know. His brain is not in the right place. Her boss is crazy. If your boss is crazy, then don't work there anymore. Stay at home like me. I have a lot of time. When I send my kids to school I have a lot of time. I can come home and have a chat with Zah. Why bother? It's OK. Now we have three people to gossip with. That's right. Hi. Hi, Jenny. You all, did you hear the new gossip about Jenny? She went out with a different guy. - I saw them, too. - Right. I saw a different man take her home. Yes, with big SUV. - Do you know? - What? That day, I saw her husband bring a man home. He was quite handsome. He looked like that Indonesian celebrity. What was his name? Arie... Arie Wibowo! Yeah. He looked like this. You guys are the same as my boss. Always gossiping. Since sis Kerani stopped working here, I've felt our office was quiet, like at a mosque. What are you saying, bro? Bossman keeps yelling at me every day. I'm getting migraines. If you look closely, my mustache is falling apart. - Why did this happen? - How should I know? - How could we run out of it? - They're gone, boss. They only asked me to tell you that. Impossible. There's no way they're gone, we have 300 pieces of them. Those goods must be gone, not stolen. I mean, those goods must have been stolen. I don't understand this matter, boss. Sister Kerani has all the data. My God! Yes, delivery? Delivery to where? - Subang Jaya. - Yes, Subang Jaya. Are you delivering it to Subang Jaya? Hello? Hello? You were just pretending. It didn't charge... Hey? Hello? Mr. Kho? Hello, Sis Kerani... Hi. Why are you giving it to me? No, no. You talk to her. And explain what I just told you earlier. You didn't explain anything. You just told me to call Sis Kerani, and after, you'd talk to her. Well, you tell her that this office is in chaos. Customers angry. Aming was fixing that crappy car until it broke. Tell her, go back to work. Hard? Huh? Tell her that. Tell her to go back to work. Tell her that this office is in chaos. That Aming was fixing the crappy car until it totally broke. - Broke. - Mr. Kho? - Did Bossman ask you to call me? - Yes. Tell him I don't want anything to do with him anymore. Sis Kerani said that that she doesn't want to have anything to do with you anymore. Hit anything? Hit what? - Tell her about the broken machine. - Tell her yourself. Hello. Kerani. I'm sorry. I already told Mr. Kho not to disturb you when you were resting. Right? You want to calm your head first. He was really stupid. Forgive him, OK? Bye. Honey? Why there is a pizza here? Aren't we going to eat out? Hey, you're home already. Sorry, I was making myself at home. Dika was here before, but maybe he's in the bathroom right now. Where have you been? Huh? Why are you just arriving home? Where have you been? Huh? Who were you going with? I was waiting for you at the office. There, I bought pizza. Do you want it? I brought it. It's very delicious. I bought it at the store I use to go to. It's expensive. What are you doing, bro? It was him. He duplicated our apartment keys and let himself in, not me. Not me. This is not me. I swear it's not me. Not again. I have office business, sorry, I have to make a call now. All right, bro... OK? Good luck, OK? I told you before, I don't want anything to do with you. Just go away! You're disturbing me. You have to speak calmly. Don't say, "You're disturbing me." Speak in a casual tone. It won't be good if the neighbors hear us arguing. - Why? Am I your wife? Just go away! - Honey. It's fine! What? This is your two month's salary. No need. I don't want it. Give it to me later when our business with the police is settled. There's no need for us to call the police. Everything can be resolved between us, nicely. Atur-able. Yes, I was wrong, and I apologized. I'm sorry. Come on, stop being angry or you will add another wrinkle to your face. Count this. It's complete, isn't it, down to every cent, plus bonus? I'm taking one slice of this pizza, OK? I'll just leave you one slice. Just go! Hurry! Yes, OK. OK, I'll go. You're overreacting. You gonna throw it at me? - Go away! - Missed me. - You missed. - Go! What else are you gonna throw at me? Oh, oh. - I'll see you at the office, OK? - Argh! OK, if you're still decided on resigning, then go to his office tomorrow and tell him that. Don't forget to say goodbye to your colleagues. You started working there nicely, so you have end it nicely, too. - But... - But what, what? You want me to change my mind, huh? Catfish Mustache, though his brain's not functioning, has good at heart, is that it? Well, just think about it first. Think. Which other company has a boss who is willing to come to his employee's house and ask her to come back to work? He was like that from way back when, and he is still like that now. That means he is consistent. Indeed, if you judge him from the outside, his appearance and his attitude have no plus sides. But again, you don't know his heart. Think about it. I think you understand his heart better than mine. So, who exactly is your wife? Me or him? Weird! Hmm. Interesting. Good question. Today, I'm going to go to the office and resign properly. I don't care if Catfish Mustache is rolling on the asphalt begging me to work with him again. I will not change my decision. Ah, there you are, Kerani. You look so much fresher. Did you gain some weight? How many kilos have you gained? See, you have a double chin. - I want to talk to you. - What a coincidence. I also want to talk to you. Come on in. - Sir, I was... - You don't have to say anything. Just don't. Be quiet. OK, try finding the caretaker. Huh? What caretaker? Whose house is this? This is an orphanage. How could you not know that? Don't you read? How should I know? There is no sign or whatever. Where is it? - Are you sure? - Where's the sign? - There is no sign. I've not been before. - Then walk. You can, right? Yes... - There, move, ask her. - OK, wait. Peace be upon you, ma'am. Peace be upon you, too. Excuse me, what are you coming here for? Ask her. Yes, ma'am. Is this an orphanage? Yes. We want to see the caretaker. I am the caretaker. Then my boss wants to speak to you. - You speak to her. - About what? - Just speak to her. - What do I say? So, the reason why I came here is to fix this house. Because when I saw this house, uh... I thought, "I think this house needs a renovation." - What is it? - Huh? Tell her, what is the proper word for it? Uh... Sorry, ma'am. What my boss is saying is that he wants to renovate this house. Yes. That's what I meant. Yes, so I plan to build bedrooms and bathrooms. And a playground. And I will provide the bedrooms with beds as well. Yes, beds. I will build a mosque, too, and I will also give you two minibuses. - Two? - Yes, two. And while the house is being renovated, the children will move to a rental house that I will be paying for them later. - I will be, what's it called? Rent. - Renting. Yes, renting the house for the kids until the renovation of this house is finished. Am I... Am I dreaming or what? No, no, no. I am serious. - Really? - Yes. Praise be to God. Wait a moment. Sir, Madam. I'd like to call in the other caretakers. - Yes, yes. - Both of you just wait here, OK? - Yes, yes. - Have a drink. Thank you, ma'am. - Sir. - Hmm? What is going on with you? - Nothing. - You're lying. I got lost at this place a long time ago. I drank coffee, and because I was in a hurry, - my laptop was left behind. - Sir. What? - Did I leave that behind? Thank you. - Yes. What's your name? - Lukman. - Lukman. Here. Take this. - No, no. You don't have to. - Just take it. No, you don't have to. Thank you. I should be the one saying thank you. Thank you, OK? And then I saw him walking a younger boy who was blind while his own leg was, sorry, not perfect. But he still did good to the blind boy. He kept guiding him along the way, and I kept following where they were going. And so, I asked the local people here, what kind of house was that. - Ma'am. - Yes? - What kind of house is this? - This house? This is an orphanage, sir. - OK. Thank you. - You're welcome. They were lacking in everything. And their life isn't as fortunate as mine. But they can still treat others kindly. They did good things for their friends. They were helping each other. While as me, I am well-off and still in perfect health, but sometimes couldn't care less about other people. That was the reason that made me feel... embarrassed. I'm embarrassed. OK, who else? Who? You have a lot of it? Ah... What's your friend's name? What about you? Which song do you like? Who? In English? Can you sing it? Wait until your new home is finished. - Bye! - Bye! - Bye! - Bye! Don't talk to anyone about what just happened then. This is just between you and me. Don't let the people at work know about this. I'm taking you here because I have confidence that you can supervise the renovation. Yes, sir. Didn't you have something important you wanted to tell me before? I just remembered now. Hmm... Nothing. What was it? Uh... Nothing, it's nothing important, sir. Good if it isn't important. Only talk about important things to me. Good morning everybody. Take a look outside, the weather is so nice, the sun is so bright. Isn't it amazing? Today is a very... special day. Does anybody remember why is this day is special? What date is this? - The 21st. - Yes, that's right. - And what day is the 21st? - Your birthday. - Right. So? - Of course we remember. How can we forget? You remind us every day. Sikin, look at me. It's amazing, isn't it? This kind of thing can make me very happy. I feel so touched. All of you remember my birthday. It's like an award to me. It's amazing. OK, so therefore today, I will treat you all. Treat. Free lunch! - Are you sure? - Sure. - Are you certain? - Certain. - Uh... - Enough. Or I will cancel it. Do you guys want it? OK, get ready, then. - Come on. - That's great. It's called sustenance of God. God has blessed us today. My God. I was a bit hesitant at first, but now I am sure I have made the right decision. I have waited for this for 15 years. He finally realizes that his workers are the good ones. Maybe he hit his head with an iron bar. I think he won the gambling in Genting. Or, his wife is giving him money. No, I think Mr. Kho was right. We can't always think badly of him. People can change, right? Right? - Sir! - No money. I'm not asking for money. Then what do you want? To borrow money? This is the end of the month, you know? Sir, are we going or not? Going where? What are you talking about? Why are you all here and doing nothing? Hey, Sikin, why are you holding your bag already? What time is this? These are still working hours. Go back to work. What are you guys doing? How are you? I'd like you to meet my children. - What's your name? - Bryan. - Brian. And this one? - Brandon. I'm Diana. Aren't they the smartest? Do you remember what I told you before about one of my staff? - What did I tell you? - She's grumpy. Yes, what else? She's mean. - When you stand too close to her? - Papi? She'll eat you. You have a weird sense of humor.
