(horn honking) (ship's horn blowing) - Raise the dead? - That's what it says. - Let me see that. Discovered by Captain James Cook in 1779, Warriors' Island is supposed to be the burial ground of disgraced martial artists, inhabited by a bizarre sect of monks, widely believed throughout the orient to raise the dead warriors from their graves, to repel attacks or threats by outsiders. The island was bypassed by the Japanese Imperial Army during WWII. - [Man] Still glad you came Mike? - [Mike] Sounds like it's gonna be quite a trip. (ship's horn blowing) - [Woman] Straight ahead, next! - [Announcer] All‘n ashore that's going ashore! (tires squealing) All ashore that's going! - Well it sure doesn't look like the brochure! - Where else can you get six weeks for a grand, complete? - Well I don't know, I thought it'd be something like Love Boat. - [Announcer] All ashore that's going ashore! - Are you the boys from the Burbank Karate Club? - In the flesh! - Well hurry up, we're ready to embark! - This is positively my last sailing for that woman. - You said the same thing last time, Captain. The time before that too. - This time I mean it, I mean all she wants is profit! (rustling) (crashing) She doesn't spend a nickel on this tub! I mean, look at it, crappy maintenance, inept crew, well present company accepted of course. - You're Taylor, you're Schwartz, and you must be O'Malley. - Right, he's the guy that decided to come at the last minute. - Still want to own your own Chinese restaurant one day? - Yes sir. - Hmm, you do, huh? You'll never make it on the wage she pays 'ya, never! There's only one word for you madam, that is cheap! - Listen, I want you guys to meet my chef! He's pretty good at that Kung Fu stuff. Maybe you guys can get together and put on a little show or something? - I hope he can cook as good as he can fight, I got a big appetite. - I bet you do babe! Oh (chuckles), feel that! Come on guys let's go. - Sad... - [Woman] Get with it, come on fellows. - Mrs. Buck! We're ready to weigh anchor when you are! - Okay, okay, I'm coming, I'm coming! - Weigh anchor! (metallic ratcheting) (ship's horn blowing) - [Announcer] For those of you who like martial arts, we have an exhibition in progress (weapons clattering) on the forward promenade, you can see (mumbles)... - Hey what the hell's going on out there? Hey, hey, this ain't no playground you guys! (passengers chattering) Somebody might get hurt! (grunting) (weapons clattering) What the hell are you doing, stop that! Do that someplace else! Hey, get out of here! Get! (grunting) (weapons clattering) - May I pay you a modest compliment? You have beautiful eyes. (giggles) - What's it any of your business buddy? - I'm sorry, I thought the lady was alone. - Oh sit down, here have one of my mar-two-nees. - Um, this is my husband Loyd. - How you doing? - When we get together the way to get buy is pull out the booze and let's get high!

They're wrecking my ship! - You shut up! - My ship! - Your ship? Brother this is my ship! These are my passengers and this is my fun and you get out of here! Just get out of here! - You know what it's bad enough that her bar blocks my view, now my window's broken! Next thing it'll be my tooth! - Get out of here! You're blocking my view! - Mrs. Buck one day you'll go too far! - [Man] Let's have a big hand folks, for that exciting performance of Bo Jitsu! (applauding) While my colleagues get ready for their next stunt, I'd like to give a short lesson to the ladies in self defense. Now I'll need one volunteer! - Go ahead Cookie, he doesn't have to know you're on the LAPD SWAT team! Go on! - How 'bout you? (pleasant music) - Okay. - Now the first thing I want you people to see, is the wrong way to fend off an attack. Now what would you do if I came at you with a knife? - I certainly wouldn't tell you! (woman giggling) - Okay just do it! (growling) See what I mean? - I haven't done it yet. Huh? - Hai, hai! (grunting) (woman giggling) (foot thumping) (groaning) Hai! (applauding) (ominous music) (pleasant music) (engine chugging) - [Captain] Easy men! Didn't any of you ignoramuses ever dock a ship before? Watch out god dammit! - Give me three cases of Smirnoff Vodka and two cases of Johnny Walker Red. - [Announcer] Make sure your shop carts, are... - God forbid we should run out of liquor! You can bet they don't sell it on Warriors' Island! - [Announcer] If you have any questions regarding your (mumbles)... - We're supposed to sail by the island, not go on. - A lot of our passengers want to go ashore and take pictures of the monks. - No one is permitted to go there except martial arts outcasts. Even they are allowed to go there, only to die. - That's right, the Potter's Field of Kun I'm sorry Chin, it's one of the places our passengers paid to see. - Setting foot on the island, will invoke wrath of Buddha! - Will you do me a favor? Don't be so damn superstitious! Oh and check out our stores of olives and pretzels. - [Announcer] Do not drink the tap water, as a precautionary measure against (giggling) - There they are. - (mumbles) plague. - Sure you don't want to see kickboxing with us Mike? - Uh, no thanks John, I'm going shopping with Ann, Lloyd and Hazel. - Then we're gonna catch a live, sex show! - Lloyd! - Just kidding Ann. - He is (chuckles). (bell ringing) - Like a drink? - Nah, no thanks. - Ready gang? - Ready. - Go on let's go! - And be sure to be aboard at 0900 hours tomorrow morning, - Dodds! - when we sail - I'm going shopping. - to Warrior's Island. - Yeah? - Outside of deodorant is there anything else you need?

(tires screeching) Ah, that's, I want you all to see the K-Mart of the Jade trade. You won't believe this place, it is something else. - Here you go. - Thanks a lot pal! - Wait uh, I know where it is, it's six blocks thataway, come on. - Wait a minute, I got an idea. Aren't you bushed? - No not particularly. - Yes you are, why don't Mike and I grab a cab back to the ship and soak our corns in epsom salts, that way then she'll have a dance partner tonight. - All right. - Taxi! See 'ya later! 900 1/2 General Mathin Street. - What's that? - The Palace of 1001 Pleasures! - The what? (car horn honking) - It's a cat house. - Oh Lloyd, right now I really don't feel like going to any place. - This is the only chance I got to hit this joint! You're my cover! You don't have to do anything if you don't want to. - Okay, but I don't want to stay long. - [Lloyd] Thanks O'Malley. You're a good sport. - I don't believe this! These prices aren't real! I don't know how they do it. - Volume I guess. (customers chattering) - 550 pounds of uncut, double-A grade jade a week, and our only real expense is the airplane, and we got that from war surplus. - (chuckles) Do you realize what airplane fuel costs nowadays? - What's the difference? I st|ll think I'm entitled to more than 10% of the profits! - What if the monks refuse the girl again, like they did last time? - Like you said man, then we start breaking heads! Look, they need us as much as we need them, right? - Listen we ain't got much time left! I think we better go. (brakes squeaking) (doors thumping) - This won't take long. - What's all this? - [Lloyd] Today must be trash day. Forget the outside, I hear the inside's great! - Aren't cat houses legal here? - No. - Seems like they should be. - That must be it! - Whoever named this place the Palace of 1001 Pleasures, (chuckles). (knocking) (pleasant music) - Hi guys. My name's Mai Lu, come on in. - [Lloyd] Thanks doll. - (mumbles) I go in first, see who's there, and check the exits. If I don't come out after five minutes, you come in! Questions? - No man. - There it is up ahead. Pull over on that bridge Cooper! Where are my binoculars? Don't look suspicious, let's have a look. Second floor. (tense music) It's a good time, there won't be many customers there now. Maybe none. (suspenseful music) - Oh that's nice. You know, you go down there! - How long will you be in town. - Just a day and night. Our ship sails in the morning. - Where to? - A place called Warrior's Island? Have you ever heard of it? (knocking) - Ah, excuse me. (pleasant music) - Hello, I'm Mai Lu, come in. - Drop the joint Cooper! (engine revving) - Screw you! - How come the monks have the power to raise the dead? - I imagine it's a closely guarded secret. And you've never heard of the place? - Uh-uh, I'm strictly a city girl. - Anybody here going to Warriors' Island? - I am, have you heard of it? - Damn right! A couple of years ago I was stuck there! - No kidding? - It's a terrible place. - [Thug] Come on back, back, back, stop! (crunching) Stop you pot head! - Why in the hell are you going there, if you don't mind my asking? - I understand that's where martial arts criminals meet their maker. - That's pure bullshit mine friend. Let me give you some good advice. I would avoid Warriors' Island, like the black plague. (knocking) - Open up this door, Police! - Open this door! - Open up! - What's that? - It's a raid! - Open up! (dramatic music) - There must be a mistake! Mama San paid the cops off! Always she does! - Let's go! - Maybe your Mama San forgot this month! - Break it down! (clattering) (screaming) - What are you doing here? - Read, police, police, police! - (mumbles), you're hurting... (perky music) - Leave me alone! (screaming) - Uh-oh what's that? Hey! Jesus! - Do me a favor will 'ya? Next time pick somebody else to be your cover. - Well you said you didn't want to stay long! - Hey, hey! (perky dance music) - I sign on cruise, they sail by the island, not go on island. I have to go and talk to Captain Dodds. - So they bust in the door, and then Lloyd and I went out the window! - (mumbles) tab? - Six dollars please. - I just can't see you in a whorehouse in the middle of the afternoon Mike, it isn't like you. Ah, I was just doing the guy a favor Gary. - Ah, the joint must have done something pretty bad for the police to pull a raid. Maybe the girls have a disease? (chuckling) - Soon as I get enough money stashed away I'm gonna buy my own ship. I'm tired of taking orders from a silly female. - That's smart Harry. - That's where you can come in. I'm gonna be needing a, recreation director. - Yeah? - By the way, what's your line of business now? - Construction. - Construction, what do you do? - I run a forklift. - Oh. I gotta see a man about a horse. (chuckling) - Oh Big John... - That's him. - [Thug] Get him. - Ah...

(grunting) - All right. - You know I thought he was a fag, until I felt his knife! - A knife? Got any idea what he's after? - Well one thing's for certain. - What's that? - It wasn't my body! (laughing) (bell ringing) (chattering) - [Announcer] We are now departing. Those of you tossing money into the air are again reminded that the divers request that you do not throw pennies, nickles or dimes, only quarters and above. - They are heading straight toward our source of jade! We have to stop those fools! - No question man! - Well what the hell happened last night, you were supposed to kidnap the captain! Zis is ridiculous! - I told 'ya, next time we won't miss, don't worry! I've got this fantastic plan! - Don't worry he says. - I guarantee that ship will never reach Warriors' Island. The plan is already in operation. This time tomorrow, everybody aboard that ship will be dead! - [Announcer] The spread for today, (mumbles), roast suckling pig, lobster chop suey, and French fried squid.

They did any of those things uh, they were outcasts of society. The only way they could make things right was by committing suicide. - Why did they do that on Warriors' Island? - Well they believed that the monks would make them raise again from the dead to fight. That way they would get a second chance, to uh, (mumbles)... (tender music) - ls that true? - Probably not. - It's just a fantasy. Yeah. - Hope you're for real. - Me? I'm flat out (mumbles) Eileen. - I bet you say that to all the girls. - I don't.

I'd come home and find them in my bed! He was a rotten son of a bitch! So one day I had enough, I couldn't take it any more! So I ended it. - Oh, oh I see, and you took this cruise to get him out of your mind, right? - I took this cruise to get myself out of the country! - Why? - There's a stupid little murder warrant out for my arrest. Oh! Well, I sure hope they get this boat going! Uh, uh, I'm real anxious to get to Warriors' Island and see the monks. (tense music) - [Crewman] Why should we help? The engines ain't our concern.

(forlorn music) (explosion booming) (flames crackling) (fire alarms wailing) (explosion booming) - Boy it's a big haul this time! - I told you these monks wouldn't get fancy if we stood our ground. We got a good thing going for us here Cooper. One basket of this shit is worth over $200,000! - Yes one thing I can't understand, if the monks like sex so much, why don't they go directly to a whorehouse and buy it themselves? (chuckling) - They're not buying the girls for sex! - Then why are they buying them? - For food! - Are you serious? - They claim that female flesh, gives them the power to raise the dead. Come on let's go. (woman whimpering) (monks chuckling) (forlorn music) (waves lapping) (groaning) (water splashing) - What's our chance of being sighted? - Zero, we're at least a couple of hundred miles from the commercial shipping lanes. - We're taking water on really fast. - I know. - Don't worry Hazel, everything's gonna be all right. - I feel so sick I feel lousy! - I know. (Hazel groaning) - How long you think this raft will stay afloat? -About a day, tops. If a certain party hadn't been so damn cheap when it came to maintenance, we could stay adrift for a week, at least. (engine rumbling) Ah! - What's that? - There, there a plane! (chattering) (gun firing) - Will you look at that! (shouting) - Help! - A Plane! - Hey you dummy! - We're here, here! We're here! (shouting) - You and the rest of our boys, what's left of them, that is, have done a great job in this little operation I'm running, so I've decided to increase your share of the profits to 15%. - Hey, are you sure they barbecue 'em, they don't just boil 'em in a pot? - They barbecue them. (faint popping) What's that? - What? (faint popping) - That popping? - It's peoplel - People? - It's those people from the ship, you stupid son of a bitch! You can't do nothing right Cooper! You should have been destroyed at birth! (screaming) - Hey, hey you! (shouting) - Here, here! - We're here! - We're here! (shouting) (engine rumbling) - Here we are! (shouting) - Bastard! - Stop! - How come he didn't tip his wings? - [Speer] Crossbows! That's what I get for teaming up with a hippy! (mysterious forlorn music) - Can you hear me out there? Can you hear me out there? Hello, can you hear me out there? - Save your breath son, you're only talking to the sharks. The South China Sea is famous for sharks. - [Mike] What's that? - It's land! - Oh! - Ah! It's land! - It's land! - Looks like we're gonna be on land in less (mumbles)... [Lloyd] Hey! It's land, land ahoy! - Why so glum? We're gonna be on land in a few minutes! (survivors chattering) - Land! - (mumbles) into a juicy coconut! (screaming) (dramatic music) (exotic birds screeching) - [Hazel] I think I'm gonna vomit! - Go ahead Hazel, you'll feel better! (groaning) - Grab my hands! - Eileen (mumbles)... - Walk, watch your dress! - Good old Mother Earth! (mumbles) raft, (mumbles) hot shower. - Where are we? - Well I would say this is Warriors' Island. - What's the next move? - We got two choices, we can stay here on the beach and wait for help, or we can trek inland, and try to get some help. - Let's go. - Hold it John. Okay what about the rest of you? What do you want to do? Chin? What do you think? - We should not be here! - Well Jesus, there's not much we can do about that! - Come on, let's get the show on the road! - Oop! (grunting) - Thanks Harry. (ominous music) (insects chirping) (birds singing) - I think our chances of spotting a drug store are next to nil, Hazel. - [Hazel] Keep a sharp eye out for snakes Harry, I can't stand snakes! - It's a hell of a lake. - [Mike] You wanna stop here? - We still got a half hour of daylight left. Let's keep going. - Okay. - Hold it. (grunts) This is where we camp for the night. The one mistake we made Chin was not bringing a case of gin with us! - Let's go Lloyd. - Who elected you the leader? - Nobody, I'm just saying we gotta get out of here... - I don't give a crap what you say! I got as much right as anybody to call the shots in this group! Another thing O'Malley, stay the hell away from my wife! - [John] Come on Mike, we don't have time for games. He wants to camp here, let him. - Oh, I see, body beautiful thinks he's gonna call the shots. - Let's go. - Wait a minute, I want to know if you're the new self-appointed leader. (thumping) - Don't ever put your hand on me again! - Come on Lloyd! - O'Malley! - Oh my god! - Lloyd, wait... -Jesus! - Wait a minute I (gun firing) (mumbles) beautiful! (thumping) - All right that's it, we're gonna camp here for the night. (monkeys screeching) (insects chirping) You're not thinking about going for a swim are 'ya? (chuckling) You know, Asian piranha are twice as big as the South American kind. - How do you know that? - (chuckles) In the war I saw a Viet Cong fed to 'em. - Sorry about that. - That's okay. People react to pressure in different ways. - Michael, thank you for, watching over the group. - I hope I'm, not overstepping my boundaries. - I think a group needs a leader. - That's not what I mean. I mean with you. I'm sorry that's not fair of me. - No it's fair, it's just not simple. Lloyd is a really nice man, he means really well, he just drinks too much, and gets a little confused sometimes. - Do you love him? - No. - Well I can't tell you how much I wanted to hear that. - Remember those things Harry, those big, mon, mon, monitor lizards? Well I hate 'em! Keep an eye out for monitor lizards will 'ya Harry? I'm scared! - [Cookie] This is the place on the Brochure! - You superstitious? - Oh my god help us! - This must be the place where they buried the god damned Kung Fu fighters. (tense music) (explosion booming) (screaming) (machine gun firing) (screaming) (whooshing) (explosion booming) (machine gun firing) - Quick, run! (mumbles), watch out! Yeah! - Let me see the bulles! (machine gun firing) (suspenseful music) - Let's move in for the kill! - (mumbles) these guys! - Yeah let's go for it man! - I saw Clint Eastwood do this in a movie once! - What are you gonna do? - Down would you? - [Cookie] I hear something! - Die (mumbles)! (gun firing) - [Harry] Die sucker! (screaming) (suspenseful music) (machine gun firing) (shouting martial arts cry) (machine gun firing) - Where's Eileen, huh, huh? (groaning) (laughing) - No, (screams)! (dramatic music) (groaning) (distant machine gun firing) (grunting) (hits thudding) (dramatic music) (distant machine gun firing) (grunting) (weapons whooshing) (grunting) (hits thudding) (groaning) (dramatic music) (grunting) (groaning) (hits thudding) (grunting) (screaming) (grunting) (hits thudding) - I know you! (gun firing) (gun clicking) (dramatic music) (machine gun firing) (gun firing) - You bastards! - Why do those dudes want to harass us so badly? - Now I know where I know that guy from! - Who? - That guy with this bazooka! He's the guy I saw at that cat house! He took a look at the brochure and he warned us not to come here! - That still doesn't answer the question why he doesn't want us here. - There must be something here they don't want us to see. - Uh fellas, there's some gentlemen behind us. - Welcome my friends! - Who the hell are you guys? - I wanted to ask you the same question. Follow me. - What do you think? - Like the man said, let's follow him. (monks laughing) (brooding music) - You came on this island without permission. - We had no choice. - But you are still trespassing. - That's bullshit. - John, cool it. Okay, you guys say you have no radio. Could you lend us a boat? - That is a possibility. - Let's get out of here these guys are jerking us around, they're not gonna give us diddly! - If you want help, you must earn it. - How? - By proving yourself in battle. We were not convinced on what we saw in the cemetery. Your opponents showed cowardice, when pressed. (eerie tense music) - You must demonstrate, superior fighting skills, for you to redeem yourselves! - I got your redeem. - What do you want us to do? - Fight our champions. - If you defeat them, we will help you. (insects chirping) (chattering) - [Helen] What's that, what am I eating? - It could be a lot worse. - Excuse me. - [Lloyd] Could be a lot worse if we don't get anything to drink at all! - Did you know I used to be in show business? - No I didn't know that Hazel. - Uh-huh, I was in a contract, to Warner Brothers. - I'll bite that. - A lot of companies were after me. The gas company, the electric company, and the power company. - That's funny Hazel. - This is what you'd call an old-fashioned, all-out, no-strings jungle feast! - Let's cut the ceremonies and get on with the fight. (eerie suspenseful music) - Departed gladiators of death, rise from your graves and lock weapons in battle with the evil (woman whimpering) enemy that has invaded our island! Rise and come forward, from your sacred graves! Show us bloodshed, like it used to be, put on a show we will never forget! Slice the meddlesome intruders into little pieces! (eerie groaning) Rise, and come forward from your sacred graves, so that you can prove you are not the cowards and losers and bullies that society said you were! - Oh Master! Make them invincible! Make them stronger, so they can, once more, kill! - Find more (mumbles), gladiators, show us in death, (screaming) what you are (mumbles)! (monk laughing) (woman screaming) (monk invoking) - What is the main course? - This is it. - [Harry] Jesus that's a worm, and that other... (survivors chattering) - Yeah? - You know Hazel... - Maybe you can come work for me some day, when I open a restaurant. - [Harry] A McDonald's hamburger! - Are you sure? - Or a Jack-in-the-Box! - That's her, I'm positive! (monks chuckling) - Thank you, Heavenly Masters, for delivering this tender, young, delicious female (mumbles)! (screaming) (Eileen whimpering) (monk laughing) - I started the guided tours at Universal, did you know that? - The guided tours at Universal? - Uh-hmm. -You did? - You spit on me! - I'm sorry. - Mai Lu isn't it? - Yes. - I was at your place when it got raided. - You don't have to worry about gaining weight so... - You really had me fooled there, I didn't take you as one of the kidnappers that day. - [Lloyd] Did you ever have diarrhea, I mean real serious... - I'm not one of the kidnappers! None of us are, we want to get off this island as bad as you do! - Oh sacred masters in the sky, instill our fighting cadavers with kicking, slashing strength, to execute righteous slaughter! (monks laughing) (Eileen whimpering) (Eileen screaming) - We will get you off this island, that's a promise! - Go round up your friends. - Yeah right! But there are two more girls, the monks haven't released yet, inside there! - Let's go get 'em! You stay here and keep an eye on things. - Hey the other one's an American! (monks laughing) (Eileen screaming) - [Mike] Move out! (guns firing) (Eileen screaming) (explosion booming) (groaning) - [John] I'll have you untied in a minute! (Eileen grunting) (thumping) (groaning) - Eileen! (monks laughing) - Let's get out of here right now! - [Hazel] Come on Harry, we're leaving! Let's get out of here! - Let's get the hell out of here! (women screaming) (dramatic music) (machine gun firing) (gun clicking) (screaming) (chattering) (mumbles), we gotta get out of here! (gun firing) Will you save her, here! (Mai screaming) (zombie groaning) (machine gun firing) (gun clicking) (grunting) (hits thudding) - Here sweethearts! (hits thudding) (woman squealing) (suspenseful music) - [Hazel] Harry? - [Mike] Hey, Harry, watch out behind you! (screaming) (kick thudding) (zombie groaning) Come on let's go! (hits thudding) (dramatic music) (zombies growling) (fist thudding) (grunting) (zombies growling) - [Harry] Let's get our asses out of here! (grunting) (zombies growling) Cookie come on let's go! (grunting) (hits thudding) (perky music) (zombies groaning) (women screaming) (clattering) (dramatic music) Come on, let's go! (monks chuckling) (women screaming) (zombies groaning) (women screaming) - Wait guys, not yet, wait! - Come on for god's sakes! Come on! - Hurry up you guys, come on! Come on! - [Harry] Come on! (suspenseful music) (zombies groaning) (flames crackling) (zombies groaning) (clattering) (zombies groaning) - [Hazel] I feel so scared! - Stop... - I can't go on. - Really, just drop me, please... - [Hazel] Harry, I think he's gonna die! - It's okay, hey baby it's okay! (eerie suspenseful music) (monks laughing) - Good bye Ann... - [Hazel] He was one of my passengers! (sobs) A paying passenger! (Ann sobbing) My god! (suspenseful music) (speaking foreign language) (monks chuckling) - [Hazel] That lake is infested with piranha Harry... - Hey, that's Speer's plane! Yeah I'm positive! - You sure? - That's how I got here! (Harry chattering) - That's how we're leaving too, let's hit it! - [Harry] (mumbles), just passed us by! - It looks like we can gonna - See the water? - finally get out of here! (grunting) - This is the last one Cooper! Any more, and the plane won't be able to take off! (laughing) That would be a hell of a note wouldn't it? - [Eileen] There were all these weird looking guys standing around, they ripped off my clothes and put me in that cage, (mumbles). (mumbling) - [Hazel] Don't get too close to the water Harry, I'm telling you it's full of piranhas! (chattering) - [Harry] Weird cage, funny looking cage. - Don't touch it Harry, you might get the creeping crud! (exotic birds singing) (water lapping) What's that green? Harry I think it's some kind of mine! Look at that big green rock! - I think it's a jade mine Hazel. - Oh! We gotta... - Wait! John and I are gonna check out the airplane! You guys wait here! - Just a quick look! - Stay here Hazel. - We got the plane, if that doesn't work we'll still think of something! - Listen, I know you feel sorry about losing all your buddies, but with this our jade you can retire! I think we should have gone with the original source in the first place, instead of haggling with a bunch of cannibals. - I don't believe this! - Believe it! Let's go check out the cockpit! - Can you fly this freak? - Maybe. If I can find the keys. - Who the hell is that? - He was a helicopter pilot in Vietnam! - Okay everybody listen up please. We can't find the keys to the ignition, but if everybody gets in the airplane, I'm gonna see if I can cross a wire, okay? - Okay. - Okay. - That's far enough! Sorry we have to keep meeting under these circumstances! Actually if you had listened to me in the first place about not coming here, the bloody scene which is about to happen could have been avoided! (women screaming) (grunting) - [Harry] Let's get out of here! (dramatic music) (hits thudding) - Holy shit, not again! (eerie tense music) (women screaming) (clapping) (grunting) (women screaming) (grunting) (hits thudding) (suspenseful music) (weapons whooshing) (grunting) (water splashing) - [Zombie] Hai! Hai-ya. hai-yah! (dramatic music) (grunting) (hits thudding) (zombie groaning) - Good shot Chin! Son of a bitch! (suspenseful music) (hits thudding) (grunting) (sword whooshing) (zombie groaning) (water splashing) (engine rumbling) (grunting) (thumping) - [Mike] Bastard!

Where's old Go Chin, I gotta tell him he's getting a raise! - Oh no! (suspenseful music) (water splashing) (grunting) - Hungry bastards aren't they? (hits thudding) (grunting) (engines rumbling) (water splashing) - [Gary] Come on John get your ass in the airplane! - [Mai] Hey (mumbles) here, quick! (zombies groaning) (engines rumbling) - Take this! (suspenseful music) (explosions booming) (dramatic music) (flames crackling) - Come on O'Malley, get this thing up, get it up!
