Georg, do something! Not the clock! It's an heirloom... He's taking everything! - Franz. Not the armchair! Where shall ! sit? I‘m sick. I need a place where I can rest. At least you still have a roof over your head. Just this once. What‘s next? You stick a tag on my brother‘s models? They're priceless. The seized items Will be picked up tomorrow afternoon. You may redeem your property within the time period. lfyou want to keep the house, raise the money you owe the bank, or face eviction. Goodbye. Good riddance! What now? When Will that stupid thing be ﬁnished? When it‘s perfect. Perfect, perfect... With you, everything always has to be perfect. I thought it‘s due tomorrow morning? Stop bothering me, or it Will never be ﬁnished, Franz. But we need the money. I know. So please let me just do my work. Boy, oh boy. What a car. Seems to have a ﬂat tire. Do you think we should help her? You mean ! should help her and you watch. I would go myself, but... my diabetes. - I'll go. Do you need help? lcan't ﬁnd a carjack. - You won‘t ﬁnd it under the hood. ! rarely drive myself. You can wait in the house. - Are you sure? Just go. You're soaking wet already. You're the movie star? Dolores Moor. - Moor! ! knew it! I‘d love to see you on the big screen, but my health... Please, this way. You must excuse the mess. My brother hasn‘t cleaned up. We rarely have visitors here. Thanks. Did you build these? -Yes. My brother did. We do this for a living. I‘m something of a consultant to my brother. Here, take a look. Everything works. Flaps, tail rudder.... the landing gear... Oh, clear... I‘m sorry... - Leave it. Do you know who this is? It‘s Dolores Moor. The movie star. Would you like a drink? Franz. - No, thanks, ! really need to go home. Hold on, let me help you. Thank you for your help. - It was nothing. I‘m sorry about your model. - lt'sjust a toy. No. It‘s art. Take the second right to get back on the main road. Thank you. Maybe. It was the actress Dolores Moor, if you really want to know. Yeah, sure. You and Moor. And I had Clark Gable over for coffee. Is Franz home? He‘s out With Marlene Dietrich. I've got some jam for him. He‘s a diabetic, for Christ‘s sake! Am I the only one who cares? I‘m sorry, Georg. It was an accident. Can you repair it? No. I'll help you. - I have to deliver it tomorrow morning. Even if! worked all night on it lwouldn‘t make it. I‘d need at least a week. Can‘t you glue it on? - Glue it on? You've got to be kidding! Glue it on... Director, Sir! Director, your prototype! A bit late. Half an hour ago, we could've checked it. I‘m sorry, Sir. But it‘s got everything you asked for. Even the very smallest part is... - Look, Mr. Letterer. - Mr. Letterer. Our engineers have to at least inspect it before showing it to our clients in New York. Every cable, every conduit, every plate... It‘s all original material. It's... perfect. All right. We'll take the risk. -Thank you so much. You won‘t regret it. Give it to me. Thankd Would you like a drink? I‘m driving. Finally. We've been waiting for ages. Where have you been? |... - Miss Moor sent me to pick you up. You are Georg Letterer? May ! ask what Miss Moor would like to speak to me about? You'll have to ask her yourself. I‘m just the chauffeur. -We have quite a busy schedule. I'll let Miss Moor know that you have no time. I could... - Should your schedule allow for it... call us. Good day. Does he think we'll just drop everything here and go to Hollywood? ljust checked. No more appointments today. You don‘t know why Miss Moor wants to see me? No. - Dolores Moor! She seems to be quite famous. I‘m sorry, we don‘t have a TV. And it‘s along way to the cinema. What about food? What should ! eat? Bread is in the pantry, cheese and cold cuts in the Tupperware. I‘m sorry. Excuse me? Ah, very good. They can go in the car. The rest is over there. Villa Moor? Yes, the appointment is set. Goodbye. Why are you still standing there? The car is out front. Miss Moor wanted to see me. - You are...? I‘m sorry. Georg Letterer. This way. Miss Moor is expecting you. We have to hurry. It‘s always like this before departure. - Excuse me. Come on. Dolores? - Yes? Mister Letterer is here. Who? -The model maker... Of course! Mr. Letterer? Yes? Red or black? -The red one... I‘d say. Yes, you're right. What do you think about my house? - Well, it‘s very... very tasteful. I‘m going to sell it. - Sorry? I‘m moving to Hollywood. But there are so many memories to this place. That‘s why I‘d like you to make a copy. A model? A perfect model. Yes, well... That would take a while. How long? - Long. Very long. Take that structure behind you, for example. It would take days just to measure it. Not to mention all these artworks here. Time and money aren‘t the issue. In order to build such a model, I‘d need to be here all the time. Simone can ﬁx you a room. You can sleep here. I don‘t know, lcan't leave my brother home alone. Bring him along. My brother is... different. In the movie business, everyone is different. Your brother Will ﬁt right in. Miss Moor, the plane won‘t wait. We have to leave. Yes. Goodbye. THE FORSAKEN Passengers to Zurich Main Station, please board the train! Stop! All clear! Stop! Are you going on a trip? Yes, a business trip. If it‘s because of yesterday... - Dolores Moor made me an offer. She wants me to make a model of her villa. You want to keep living here, don‘t you? Sure, but not alone. Can‘t you do it from here? - No. All right, I'll go With you. - ! already had to convince her that I need to be on site to do all the measurements and things. Maybe ! could persuade her. She left for Hollywood yesterday. I'll come by once a week to bring you groceries. You can‘t leave me alone here! I‘m not doing well. I'll cook for you, so you'll have enough food. I‘m sure you'll ﬁnd anotherjob. Please! Franz, I really must go. I'll see you Tuesday. You? Miss Moor is away. - I know. I've come to start the job. - What job? The model. The villa! ! called earlier. Didn‘t Simone tell you? Please see Mister Letterer in, Anton. Anton. Open the gate. Hello. Anton Will take your luggage. A model... That‘s Leonhard Moor. Dolores' father. He died not long ago. Heart attack. It was a shock for all of us. Especially for Dolores, of course. He‘s the one who built this house. Was he an architect? - Oh, yes. These are the original ﬂoor plans. I thought they might help. That‘s very thoughtful of you, but plans are of no use to me. I‘m sorry, are they the wrong ones? - No, no. Don‘t get me wrong... For me, construction plans are mere theory, and thus of no value to me. I need to do all the measurements myself. Why‘s that? Look... Here, for example, it says that the exterior wall is exactly ﬁfty meters long. But perhaps it‘s only 49.9 meters. Or maybe 50.01 meters. In reality, there are no exact right angles, no straight lines, no perfection. From a microscopic perspective, everything is crooked and askew. ! create the perfect model by showing the imperfection. Look in the mirror. Your left eye is, I‘d say, ﬁve millimeters lower than your right eye. - Excuse me? And your left leg... is a good centimeter longer than your right leg. And your nose... - is far too pointed, ! know. Your nose points slightly to the right. And it‘s precisely that imperfection which contains the wonder of beauty. And your nose is not at all too pointed, if! might say so. You really have an eye for details. That leads to Miss Moor‘s bedroom. I know. Should ! leave out the bedroom in my model? I knew there‘s something wrong With you. Well, I‘d say that‘s the end of your measurements. And of your chauffeurjob. A ﬂask in your pocket, a mint in your mouth, constant sweating... and swollen blood vessels. I know an alcoholic when I see one. Here you are. Supper is getting cold. I've lost my appetite. Are you going home? I need some things from town. - How convenient, Anton was going to pick up something for me. - I can take the bus. Brilliant idea. - You need to change buses three times. I'll manage. Anton Will drive you.! insist. How I love gold and silver... And ! sure could use some... Georg Letterer... What a surprise! Hello, Johann. How‘s the craftsmanship? - It‘s going extinct. Nowadays, everything needs to be made of plastic. What do you say we bring back the good old days? Well? What do you think? Okay, now help me out here... You plan to spend the next six months... More like twelve months. You plan to spend one year building a model for some woman? Well, yes... She‘s not... some woman. She's... The woman. She's... - A woman! And a world famous one at that. That's... Georg... You don‘t honestly believe... - I Will build this model. What for? To impress a diva? What kind of life is this, anyway? ! take care of sick people in an old, moldy house in the suburbs. First my mother, now Franz. Without this job from Dolores Moor, our house Will belong to the state in a few weeks anyway. It may be true what you say, that a star like Dolores Moor is unattainable for someone like me. Maybe it‘sjust a childish dream... But this model, it Will become reality. It‘s going to be... my masterpiece. Let me think... The Meyerlinck brothers are both dead. But I do know someone in Swabia for the fabrics. Perfect. Most of the old guard are retired. But there are two Japanese who make ﬂoorboards out of bonsai ebony wood. Priceless! These Japanese are true masters. He‘s mad, Simone! You have to call Dolores and put an end to this! - Dolores trusts him. But I don't. Careful! Yes, this way. Very nice. Have you even slept in the last few days? You should take a break. - Yes, yes. Didn‘t you want to visit your brother? Tomorrow. Every Tuesday. Today‘s Wednesday. Where've you been all this time? What are you doing, for God's sake? I‘m starving. Why don‘t you use a can opener? - Because there isn‘t one. You know I‘m waiting here for you. - I‘m trying to earn some money. Or would you rather look for a job? No. I‘m sorry, ! wanted to... Oh, you know... Yes, I know. Go wash up, Franz. I'll take care of it. CAN OPENER CANNED FOOD Well? - Why didn‘t you tell me it really ﬂies? Are you pulling my leg? - No, really, it ﬂew off. You launched it into the air. - No, ! ﬁlled the tank. You should've seen my friends' faces when it ﬂew off. It took off and ﬂew away? Yes, but unfortunately we never found it again. Bye. Yes, yes. Dinner! Damn it! What exactly is your problem? My problem?That‘s simple. You. Then why don‘t you ﬁnish it if you're so interested in getting rid of me! Simone! Please see to it that this ignoramus lets me do my work! What happened? That happened! It‘s not my problem if you spill cement on your dollhouse. Maybe you can wash it off. That Will only spread it around! I need to wait all night for the cement to dry, then hopefully ! can scrape it off tomorrow. Then can we eat now? Simone? What is it? That! If he can‘t stand me, that‘s ﬁne. But if he wants to make fun of my work, then thejoke‘s over. Ah, enter thejester. You think it‘s funny, do you? Think what‘s funny? That! Is this supposed to be some kind ofjoke? You thinkthat I...? Simone, the man is clearly paranoid. - It wasn‘t you? Don‘t be ridiculous. What‘s ridiculous is your feigned loyalty. Who sniffs at nightgowns? All ! smell is the alcohol on your breath. Anton, stop it! Shall ! tell Dolores about your behavior, or can you two behave like adults? That was long overdue, if you ask me. - But I‘m not asking you. Tilt back your head. Come on. Georg, you must understand Anton. I need to build a model, that‘s all. - Anton has his reasons to distrust you. A former employee once leaked delicate information to the press. I use information about Miss Moor for my model, not for the press. I know. But how am ! supposed to make a copy of her if she‘s never around? What do you mean? ! make reproductions of all the people in the villa as well. Without Dolores Moor, the model wouldn‘t be complete, would it? Why don‘t you start With me? I‘d need to take your measurements. Measure away. What should I do? Just hold still. Do you have more siblings, other than Franz? No. Would you take off your shoes, please? Is there no Misses Letterer? No. Why not? You really ask questions. I‘m interested in details too. 23.1. Your left foot is four millimeters longer than your right one. I didn‘t mean to interrupt. Mr. Letterer is taking my measurements. For the model. - I'll get right to you. If you think I‘m going to model for your dollhouse, you're sorely mistaken. I hope that Miss Moor returns from her shoot soon, so she sees what sort of art is being done around here. When was the last time you were at the cinema? THE FORSAKEN Shall we see "The Forsaken"? - I thought you already saw it? If you prefer... shoot-em-up cowboys massacring defenseless lndians. All right then. Papers, please! Ah, Heil Hitler! But this is Dolores' bedroom. Scared? What is it? We want this to remain our secret, don‘t we? I‘m going back to my model. Every little detail, and so realistic. You can even see my birthmark! You could've used a bit less wax for my hips. ! leave nothing out and | add nothing either. All I do is recreate reality. Dolores is coming back from her shoot tomorrow. Then we won‘t be alone anymore. Tomorrow? And you're telling me this now? ldidn‘t think it was so important. - Not important? I need to prepare. Who knows how long she'll stay. And I need to remove that cement smudge. I‘m going... to bed. Yes, yes. Good night. Hello? Hello? That‘s ridiculous. Why should Georg rig the banister? Who else could it be? - Anton. He‘s mad. You need to get rid of him. My goodness, it was an accident. Hello. The arm is broken, we have to take you to the hospital. Careful. What a handsome couple. He‘s a buffoon. George, this is the model maker ! was telling you about. Georg, this is George, George, this is Georg. At home... - It‘s so nice that you're here. I‘d like to show you my progress since your departure. I‘d love to see it. But later. This gentleman is from the newspaper, doing a story on the occasion of my birthday. Yes, of course. Later perhaps. How long have you been working on that? Around six months. You haven‘t gotten very far, have you? The details need a lot of time. My father built this house. And Georg is now making a copy of it. Then we can just take the whole thing With us. Take it With you. You see, it‘s notjust a model. It‘s a perfect replica of reality. If there is black ebony here, then in the model, I've also used black ebony. See that wall made of bricks? The bricks in the model have been properly laid as well. It‘s all custom-built. Pardon my asking, but... isn‘t it extremely expensive? Well, yes... If you left out a detail or two, wouldn‘t it be quicker? And cheaper! Are you all right? - I‘m okay. But it‘s about the quality, not the price. Time and money aren‘t the issue, that‘s what you said. I‘m the wrong guy for quick and cheap. But if you want your model to have a soul... You don‘t win an Oscar With poor acting, do you? Forget what ljust said. Whatever you need, I'll be sure you'll get it. Without exception. It has to be perfect. Just like you, Dolores. Just like you. This is the Chäteau. It‘s very fruity. May I have a word With her? Of course. -This one. Have you ﬁnally read it? "Jane". Not yet. It‘s the only offer we have right now. And I can‘t hold out on the producer any longer. I'll read it. - Now. Now? But today‘s my birthday. All right, I'll read it. Now. - Good. Please don‘t set anything down here. Once again, don‘t set anything down there. Oh, I‘m sorry. Oh, I‘m sorry. ljust thought... And what do you think? I‘m not much ofa partygoer. I‘m talking about the script. "Jane". Did you read it? ldon‘t think I‘m qualiﬁed... Just say what you think. Well... it‘s an interesting story. An interesting story... Georg, here at this party there are around 100 people who Will overwhelm me With compliments even if I just shot the worst movie ever. You've always been honest. All right. I think you're too old for the part. What? Do you want to be immortal? Honestly, ! never really thought much about it. Eternal life? I'll leave that to the church. I‘m not talking about eternal life. I‘m talking about what remains of us... when we are no longer. Do you mean children? No. I mean the work we create. Wouldn‘t you accept death more if you knew that in one hundred years people would be admiring your models in museums. What for? Because they make you immortal. ldon'tjust make movies to be able to afford all of this during my lifetime. ! make movies so that something of me stays behind. Are you coming? It‘s all for you. Unwrap it! Unwrap it! What do you give to a woman who has everything? Success, beauty... For you, Dolores. That‘s an 1869 Chäteau Laﬁte. An 1869 Chäteau Laﬁte... A bottle sold at Sotheby‘s last week for a hundred thousand dollars. What do we have here? "To Dolores. Your Georg Letterer". How original. If! had known you still play With dolls... Is it a new ﬁgure for your dollhouse over there? No... It‘s my father. Thank you. What are you doing here? - Visiting my brother? You don‘t visit me. Let‘s talk somewhere else. - A friend of yours? I‘m his brother. - And you're leaving us already? Georg wants me to go. Right, clear brother? But family is always welcome. May ! take your coat? Do you have a cigarette? My brother won‘t let me smoke. How long do you intend to keep my brother captive here? Everything at home is going to the dogs. But ! told your brother you could live here too. Leaving us so soon? What about your robe? I'll be right back, baby. How could this happen. The boiler was brand-new. Calm down, Simone. Calm down. How is George? - He is stable and out of danger. Thank God. But acting might prove difﬁcult. - I thought he‘s out of danger? Yes, but With his serious burns, he might only ﬁnd roles in horror ﬁlms. Excuse me, I‘m sorry. Wait, I'll come With you. Let mejust get dressed. You're making me nervous, Simone! Dolores is going to miss her ﬂight. Finally. What do the doctors say? I hate hospitals. How is George taking it? He doesn‘t want to see anybody. Not even me. He‘s ashamed, and is afraid for his career. Where‘s my lighter? I don‘t want to push you, but... Your ﬂight to New York. I can‘t possibly leave now. Not With George in the hospital. I know. But we have a contract to fulﬁll. All right. A cyclist found him and called the ambulance. Your brother should take better care of himself. If he continues chain smoking, he'll be six feet under next time. You won‘t leave me alone again, Will you? - Franz... Your brother needs home care until he‘s better again. I thought ! could come With you. Miss Moor said ! could move in. That way you can concentrate on your work. I could even help you. I'll talk to the doctor. Please, quickly. How long do you think my brother needs before he can take care of himself again? ldon‘t have anyone who could take care of him. Wouldn‘t it be possible to treat him in the hospital? A hospital is no hotel. What you need is a nursing home. Goodbye. - Goodbye. You've got some nerve! What? - Now you show up? After your brother almost died. No wonder, the way you neglect him. And that‘s why you kill him With cigarettes? I‘m bringing him fresh clothes. Somebody has to take care of the poor man. Look, this arrived for you. Are you all right? No! I'll never ﬁnish the model like this. I don‘t know what the problem is. She looks perfect to me. The original, yes. Your perfectionism... - Simone! Aren‘t you ever satisﬁed? - Satisﬁed! lcan't create a suitable model without the original. A cheap copy is all that‘s possible. Then keep working on the villa in the meantime. lguess ! have no choice. I thought this might help you. At least the dress... Shame on you. To forsake your brother like that. Putting him in a nursing home was what ﬁnished him off. He always said that you would rather see him dead. I hope you're satisﬁed now. And I hope you die as lonely a death as your poor brother. Where have you been? Stuck in trafﬁc... - I‘m not surprised, With this weather. Have you read what the press is saying about Dolores? No. "According to a conﬁdential source, movie star George Laney had a secret affair With the young actress Anne Chambers. It is highly questionable whether his injuries were the result of an accident or were the product of a tragic jealousy." Unbelievable. What did you expect? That‘s what the press writes. Should ! get our lawyer to issue an injunction? What Will that achieve? Theyjust twist your words around. You're right. Can‘t ! help you With anything? - With what? With your work. I could really use some distraction. Not really... - Oh, come on. There must be something ! can do. I‘m good With interior design. Very well, then. Come on. Have a seat. The bonsai ﬂoorboards need to be ﬁled down at both ends by one millimeter. Why not use a saw? Because that could fray the edges and ruin the surface. - Got it. And what about us? What about us? I‘m asking you. Do you have feelings for me? What? I‘m talking to you. What do you want? An answer to my question? Keep playing With your dollhouse. What do you want? To make amends. Where did you get this? I had it made for you by the silversmith. What for? Perfect. To turn me into Dolores Moor? What makes you say that? Why should I... Now it all makes sense. God, how blind can one be? The nights in her bed, the accidents... Let me go! -Where are you going? Where? To make sure you leave this house. Anton was right. - And how exactly Will you do that? Who do you think Dolores needs more? Her personal assistant or a crazy model maker? So your relationship to the deceased was purely business related? Yes. And you can‘t think of anybody who might have done this to her? Assuming for a moment it wasn‘t an accident. I can‘t think of anybody. No affairs? No ex-husbands? No. Well, that‘s it for the moment. May ! take a look at your model? I‘m a passionate model railroader myself. You don‘t think that‘s a little bit morbid? Models are my way of coping With reality. Well yes, but... the blood! Sissi? My wife has the novel on her nightstand. Will that be Miss Moor‘s next movie? - I don‘t think so. Miss Moor has been offered the role of the Queen Mother. Of course, we turned the role down. For image reasons. I see. What a shame. My wife would've loved it. If anything else comes to mind, any detail at all that might help... Good day. This is all so surreal. A few days ago she was still here. Full of life. And now she‘s gone. Obliterated... - Let‘s go home, Dolores. When Will you be leaving again? The shoot has been postponed. Did something happen? You were right, Georg. About what? For certain roles, by now I‘m probablyjust too... Supposedly I‘m being replaced by a younger actress. New blood. No calls? No. No. But here is... Here‘s your fan mail. Is that all of it? Yes. That Laney story is like a curse. (BEAUTY AND THE BEAST) Do you know what it‘s like to be Dolores Moor? When every remark you make ﬁnds its way into the newspapers. The reporters are just waiting for you to slip up. As if they built you up only to stomp you into the dust. And you always fear that your next movie is going to ﬂop. You take the fear to bed With you, and you wake up With the fear. I‘m not sure if I want all of this anymore. As ! already told you, Miss Moor and I believe that the role isn‘t a good ﬁt. Who ! am? I‘m her agent. No, Miss Moor cannot speak to you in person. Listen, send us a proper script With a proper role, and we're in business. "Sissi, the Young Empress". My God, they want me to play Sissi! - Dolores, that role... Who would've thought they would offer me such a role? That‘s why... - Playing a 22-year old? What do you think? I need an appointment With Dr. Maier. Oh yeah, she's... -The age is... But you're right, Georg. It Will be the ﬁrst great German ﬁlm of the postwar era. It's... - What is it? Be happy for me! We'll dance the Waltz. And I‘m curious who might play the role of the Emperor. Perhaps Rudolf Prack? Moor and Prack. Germany‘s new perfect couple. It is such a relief to know you're not on the scrap heap yet. Would you raise your arms, please? Seems the bei! at your gate and door are out of order. Reaﬂy? - I was ringing forever. I‘m sorry. - ! climbed over the gate. I hope you won‘t report me for trespassing. Miss Moor. I have a couple of questions for you. - Let me take your coat. I‘m in the next room if you need me. But I have questions for the both of you. So if you wouldn‘t mind, Mr. Letterer. This is the ﬁnal autopsy report for the deceased. Did you know she was pregnant? What? Mr. Letterer? No, I didn‘t know... - But that‘s awful. Any idea who the father might be? No. ldidn‘t even know she even... When it came to personal matters, she was very reserved. What month was she in? In the third. Did you talk to Anton?The chauffeur. You don‘t think that.? Me? That‘s just unheard of. Do me a favor and get that lunatic off the streets. So there‘s nothing to Mr. Letterer‘s suspicion of you being the father? Even if I‘d had a relationship With Simone, we're talking either immaculate conception, or another candidate. Here, look... Grenade. Ripped off half my upper leg. And the gangrene cost me my testicles. Wanna see? What is it? I‘m sorry to disturb you. - I‘m working. I'll be brief. Is Miss Moor at home? No, she‘s gone to town. - I'll be gone momentarily. ! followed your suggestion and spoke With the chauffeur. Did you know that a war injury left him impotent? And why are you telling me this? Because this led me to a friend of Simone's, and to this letter. Here, Simone tells her friend about having an affair... With you! The chauffeur, Simone... These aren‘t mere coincidences, are they? I have no idea what you're getting at. I‘d like to read... And you know what else really bugs me? Do you know... what I really don‘t understand? How can a heavy wall collapsejust like that? Don‘t touch! Dolores is done! Oh my God! How realistic she looks! I have something for you too. For me? Go ahead and try it on. If you say so. Fits perfectly. What do you want from me? Help me ﬁnish my masterpiece. We need to put the roof on the model. It needs to be perfect. Do you want me to talk to the producer? You could become my partner. Is that what you want? That trash? That rubbish? Not a single script that is even close to adequate, With a role that wouldn‘t ruin you as an actress once and for all. "Kron - Planet of the Damned". A cheap, ridiculous space adventure! Or this one here... "The Hand of Death"... a stupid horror ﬂick! Schmaltzy love stories, third-rate roles! But ﬁne, go ahead. You'll be forgotten faster than you can write autographs. But I‘m going to be Sissi. What role do you think they offered you in Sissi? The young, beautiful heiress to the throne? Who else would ! play? They wanted you for role of the Queen Mother! An old woman! Call the director. All I want, Dolores, is to help you to fulﬁll your dream. The two of us may be growing old, but you, Dolores, you can become immortal. Shouldn‘t the world remember you just the way you are? Beautiful. Perfect. Help me and you Will be free. Come back inside the house. Subtitles by SUB:WERK Peter Rigney
