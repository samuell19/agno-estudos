[MUSIC PLAYING] Morning. Morning. Sally. Coffee? What kind of pie you got today? Well, what do you like? Well, what's your favorite? Why don't you make that apple? Oh, that's real good. You want some? Yeah. Why don't you put some whipped cream on that too? You got it. Say when. That enough? That'll do. Morning, IQ. Morning, Sal. Morning, sir. Morning. The usual? Yeah. Tell Cleat to get the gravy on my biscuit, not my eggs. You got it. Tabasco? You betcha. Did you want a refill? They're on the house. No, I think that'll do it. OK. Let's see. That'll be $2.25. Here's five. Keep the change. Thanks. Look, I get out of here at 3 o'clock and, well, I was just wondering if maybe, you know, you wanted-- Well, listen, I appreciate it, but I'll be heading west today. Really? How far? Hollywood. Hollywood. Yeah. I've always wanted to go to Hollywood. You don't want to go to Hollywood. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BELL RINGS] Excuse me, Mr. Trooper. What's up, boy? You mind if I ask you a question? What's that? Are you fast? The hell are you talking about? I mean are you fast? Looks like we're going to find out. [MUSIC PLAYING] Go back inside now, darling. You hear? [MUSIC PLAYING] DETECTIVE HAUSER [OVER RADIO]: Hey, did you guys hear that? Relax, it's just Shepard. Back from polishing off another brew. Thank you. DETECTIVE HAUSER [OVER RADIO]: Tell him to knock it off. You tell him. Knock it off, Shepard. Fuck you, Hauser. OK, how about next Wednesday? OK. DETECTIVE BEN HAMADA: I swear, Shepard. I don't see how you and Carpenter got along all those years. DETECTIVE SIEGEL: You want a refill? No, thanks. It'll just make me cranky like Shepard. You think you're cranky? Try asking him why they call him and Carpenter the beach boys. Hey, Jack. Why do they call you and Carpenter the beach boys? That's none of your business, Hauser. And don't call me Jack. OK? I'm going to go take a piss. Man, I owe you for that. You can pay me later. Check it out. [MUSIC PLAYING] Our dudes are here guys. I see them. Well, gentlemen. Money, money, money, money makes the world go round. Police, freeze. Do you want to die? Shit. Shit. Good evening, this is Maggie Hewitt. A six-month investigation of drug distribution among Century City Entertainment attorneys came to a bloody conclusion tonight. In a scene straight out of a TV cop show, LAPD officers shot it out with the alleged traffickers. When the smoke cleared, three were dead. Among them, suspected cop killer Lars Reder. He was fatally shot by 16-year veteran officer John Shepard. Detective Shepard, tell us what happened tonight. I killed a guy. MAGGIE HEWITT [ON TV]: Could you describe how that happened? DETECTIVE JOHN SHEPARD [ON TV]: He shot at me, and I shot back. MAGGIE HEWITT [ON TV]: Considering Reder's firepower, it is amazing you weren't hit. DETECTIVE JOHN SHEPARD [ON TV]: Yeah, I guess I was lucky. Turn that shit off will you, Terry. MAGGIE HEWITT [ON TV]: Thank you, detective. Spearheading this investigation is Lieutenant William Carpenter. Lieutenant, I understand that you and Detective Shepard were once partners. Yes, ma'am. For almost 10 years. What kind of a cop is he? Good cop, 100% cop. --look at this. Excuse me. Thank you, lieutenant. MAGGIE HEWITT [ON TV]: We have another police-related story. This one without such a happy ending. Early this morning, Arizona state trooper, Lewis Johnson, was shot and killed by an unknown assailant outside a diner near Flagstaff. According to a witness, the assailant is a Caucasian male in his 20s wearing, believe it or not, a cowboy holster. This bizarre mystery man was last seen heading west in a vintage, red, Cadillac convertible. It would seem that Trooper Johnson could have used John Shepard for backup today. Back to you, Brad. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] You're up late. Yeah, busy night. Did you call Sarah? Yeah, yeah. I called Sarah. She worries about you. She worries about you too. How was the bar? DETECTIVE JOHN SHEPARD: It was a million laughs. You want a beer? No, I don't need it. What about you, John? You need anything? I'm OK. You sure? Yeah. No. I don't know. I killed a man today. How OK can I be? You did your job, John. You saved your partner's life. Pretty OK in my book. Pretty OK with brass down at Parker Center. It's a good shoot, John. Another bad guy bites the dust. LIEUTENANT BILL CARPENTER: Yeah, something like that. Look, John, when we pull the trigger on a man, even when it's justified, that is the hell of our job. We want to change it, replay it, but we can't. But you are a cop, and you will deal with it. What about you? How did you handle it? Badly some days. Look, one thing. I would keep the brewskis in the refrigerator next time. It's just beer, Bill. I'm going home. And I don't want to see you for at least two days. Well, what am I going to do for the next couple of days? I don't know. Finish painting your house. Take a drive north. Go to Disneyland. Don't give me any shit over this or I'll make it an order. You get me? I got you. When you come back, you think about coming over, OK? Sarah would like to see you. So would the girls. They keep asking me, when's Uncle John going to teach us how to surf? Why don't you teach them? No, I don't think so. Wipe out King of Santa Monica. They want to learn from someone famous. You're still a legend down at the beach, John. All I did was surf. Yeah, I know. DETECTIVE JOHN SHEPARD: Hey, Bill? Give them my love, will you? I will. Goodnight, John. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SIRENS] You in the car, step out and put your hands up. Keep them where I can see them. So you fast? You bet your ass I am. You ain't that fast. Nice. Detective Hamada's room. Right down the hall, room 7A. Thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, Ben. How are you going? Treating you all right? This is nice, clean, private. Nobody to bother you. Yeah, it's great. Took my roommate away a couple hours ago. Cancer. Yeah, well, the point is you're going to be OK. DETECTIVE BEN HAMADA: Oh, yeah. Fit as a fiddle. Good as new. DETECTIVE JOHN SHEPARD: Yeah, well. OK. I-- I brought you a piece of that, you know, chocolate pecan fudge butter something that you like. But this chunky nurse, you know, she took it from me. She's probably scarfing as we speak. Yeah, that's my loss. Oh, and I got you this. I got you-- I got you this architecture magazine you like. It's the latest issue. Yeah, I got a subscription. DETECTIVE JOHN SHEPARD: So thinking about coming back after you're rested up? Dorothy and I are talking it over. OK, if you need anything. [MUSIC PLAYING] [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] Morning, dead eye. You never answered my question. What are you talking about? Why do they call you the beach boys? Get out of my face, will you Hauser? You know, Ricky, you might be onto something here. The resemblance is amazing. DETECTIVE SIEGEL: No, I'm telling you it's him. The man himself. See, I can tell by the way he moseyed on in here to the squad room. Something's not quite right here though. Something's missing. The proper head gear. [APPLAUSE] There it is. I told you guys. John Wayne in the building. You guys beat it. DETECTIVE HAUSER: Oh. John. Oh, sorry. Close the door? Yeah. I recall I gave you almost an order about taking some time off. I did. I went to the beach. I also saw Hamada at the hospital. And now you're back. Pissing on my detectives sense of humor and their goodwill. Ah, come on, Bill. These guys are-- No, look John, you come. On. They're thinking about it. Is it going to be me next time? Am I going to be able to pull on a man and kill him? Can I do my job? Yeah. All that John Wayne shit. John it is sanity maintenance. I mean, we all deal with this job in our own way. Don't we, John? Sorry. [PHONE RINGING] Carpenter. Yes, Chief. Yeah, I'd be glad to tell him, Chief. He just walked into my office. And you give my best to Mavis too. Thank you, Chief. What's that all about? They're giving you the medal of valor. You've got to be kidding. You know the chief does not have a sense of humor. Ceremony is in a couple of days. As soon as the mayor can find a little time in his schedule. You know how gung ho he is about improving the department's image. Look, Bill. I don't want it. You just tell him-- LIEUTENANT BILL CARPENTER: What? Go to hell? Bad idea. Good idea, you take the medal, and you just forget about. And just go home, John. Take care of your house. Forget about it. I already did that. I'm coming back to work, OK? OK, if that's what you want. What is this? It's a negative ionizer. A neg-- a what? It's-- it's for my sinuses. The Santa Anas bother my sinuses. It filters the air or something like that. Sarah gave me that. I'm getting coffee. How do you know it works, Bill? It doesn't make any noise. [LAUGHS] Good morning, Lieutenant. [INAUDIBLE] Yeah, I know. I know I'm late. Didn't have any of those jelly donuts. So I got you some of those cocoa ones you like. Excuse me, Lieutenant. I'm going to have some more of that negatively ionized coffee. It works, John. Yeah. What is that? Well, if you're back, that would be your new partner. [MUSIC PLAYING] Do you want anything else? No, I think that would be it. Hey, bitch. Give me the fucking money. Put it in the bag, now. What are you looking at, Gomer? Got a problem? Give me the wallet. Come on. Come on. Give it to me. Give me the wallet. [SHOUTING] [WHISTLES] Clean up in aisle seven. So much do I owe you? It's on the house. Why, thank you. I appreciate it. And don't you think you'd better call the police? Oh, sure thing, mister. Right away. You have a nice day now, you hear? [MUSIC PLAYING] [SIRENS] Senor, senor. [INAUDIBLE] Just this guy? Si. OFFICER: Can you tell me what happened? CASHIER: Si, senor. Yes, sir. He come in, and he have the gun. And he asked me for the money. I then another man come and he shoot him. OK, OK. What guy? [MUSIC PLAYING] Him. That man. You do this? Yes, sir. I did. You got a permit for that? No, sir. I don't. We're going to have to take that weapon for the time being. Well, you can take it if you're fast enough. Are you fast enough? [SHOUTING] REX: And you saw it, right? They drew first. They drew first. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Yes, shots fired. Officer down at corner of Fountain and Hobart. Need some boys done here. Thank you. What have you got? He's a white male in his late twenties between 5' 10 and 6 feet. Clerk said he smiled a lot. Reminded her of Clint Eastwood. She said he was very polite. I made a call for the sketch artist. Good work. Thanks. If you don't mind lieutenant, I need a little air. [SIRENS] He's our guy, John. What guy? Same guy who probably killed the highway patrolman out by Barstow. Same M.O. He's a collector. Guns, badges, belts, wallets. No witnesses, right? No, why? Because the guy that killed the state trooper wore a cowboy hat, remember? You know if he took anything? No, but we can find out. What are you bucking for sergeant, John? Who, me? Detective Shepard. Shit, can I leave now? Nice to see you again, detective. Are you in charge of this investigation? I'm just working here. He's in charge. Excuse me. Lieutenant, are there any suspects or motives at this time? Hey, that's Maggie Hewitt, isn't it? Yeah, so? She a friend of yours? Not exactly, why? Good, introduce me. Get in the car. Miss Hewitt, like I said, we're analyzing the evidence, and we're going to follow the clues. Thank you. Thank you, Lieutenant. Cut it. Let's go. Damn, she's pushy. Welcome to the club. Will you get in the car? Come on. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BANGING SOUND] Howdy, ma'am. [GASPS] Lovely place you got here. What do you want? You don't beat around the bush, do you? Strictly business. What do I want? You see, I've got a plan, and you're going to help me. How? REX: Well, you see, you're on TV. Right? You do a real nice job too. I saw you at the liquor store today. You killed those officers. Your quick. You're very quick. I can use that. I don't understand. Well, Maggie-- you don't mind if I call you Maggie? You see, I'm fast. I mean, I'm real fast. I can fast draw. When I was a little kid, you know, I used to beat all the other little kids. And now, I want to let everyone else know that I'm the best there is. How do I fit in to all this? Well, Maggie, this is what you're going to do. I want you to chronicle my life story for the movies. All about me. The advance of my illustrious career. So listen, I'll be a-- I'll be seeing you around. Wait a minute. Who are you? You can call me Rex. You can call me Rex. [MUSIC PLAYING] Gotcha. You find anything interesting? Just checking. Hey, nice suit. Coffee? Thanks. How about a donut? No. They're fresh. So? So, we're off. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] LIEUTENANT BILL CARPENTER: Come in. It's out bran, John. You got to get some of this in your diet. It is great for the cholesterol. Yeah. You got to start taking better care of yourself. John, don't-- don't do that. Yeah, right. LIEUTENANT BILL CARPENTER: Got a call from personnel. Hamada's [INAUDIBLE] taken his pension. Same usual reasons. Life's too short, et cetera. I know it doesn't break your heart. But I though you'd like to know anyway. That's terrific. You get any sleep last night? Yeah. Yeah, lots. Why? You look like hell. Thanks. How do I smell? Lemon fresh. By the way, ballistics called. The gun used to kill Rogoff and [INAUDIBLE] yesterday was the same one used on the Arizona state trooper. He took the gun. He took the belt. LIEUTENANT BILL CARPENTER: Yeah, wallet too. Still unofficial, but the highway patrol thinks this guy killed one of their people too. So we got the same MO. Looks that way. Are you flirting with me? Yes, I am. What is she doing here? She had a visitor last night while she was soaking in her hot tub. Could be our shooter, could be some crazy looking for airtime. Shook her up pretty good. We're waiting for a sketch artist. [INAUDIBLE] can handle it. He's awfully enthusiastic, isn't he? Yeah, well, we were young once too. We were never young. What's bugging you? You want to know what's bugging me? I'll tell you what's bugging me. In about an hour and a half, I am going to be the main attraction in a three ring circus. I'm going to be on stage. The mayor is going to walk up to me, and he's going to shake my hand, and tell me what a hero I am. And I'm going to stand there like an idiot and say, thank you, sir. I was just doing my job. I'm not a great cop. I'm not even a good cop. I'm just a cop. I ain't no hero. Don't let it bother you, John. I don't. [INAUDIBLE] Not now, no. [MUSIC PLAYING] Thank you, Mr. Mayor. The city of Los Angeles is proud, and very fortunate, to have you as a member of the department. Keep up the good work. Thank you very much. I was just doing my job. [APPLAUSE] Nice speech. Well, I guess that about does it for today. Thank you all very, very much for coming. And once again, let's congratulate Detective Shepard on a very fine job. [APPLAUSE] Hey, Jack. What's the rush? I'm getting the hell out of here. Detective Shepard, can I ask you just a couple of questions, please? - No. Is that thing on? Yes. Well, turn it off. Keep it rolling, Andy. Detective Shepard, I'm only asking for a few moments of your time here. People are interested in you. They'd like to know how you feel. Now, I'm not asking for much. Just keep that out of my face, OK? FELICITY: Hello, Jack. Remember me, stranger? Felicity. How you been? Can't complain. You look tired, Jack. I've been busy. Police work. You busy now? I got a few minutes. So, how's Bill? He and Sarah still together? Yeah, yeah, they got married. They got three kids. Girls. How's Ralph? Rolph. Rolph. I wouldn't know. Things didn't work out for us. That's too bad. Not really, I met a nice guy a few years ago. I remarried. Got two kids, Amanda and Chris Junior. Got a house in the Palisades. I'm driving a Mercedes. What could be bad? You know, Jack, those kids really love the beach. Does that remind you of anybody? That was a long time ago. Still got that little beach house down in Venice? Yeah, I still have that little house in Venice. You're still single? Yeah, you were about the closest I ever came. What's on your mind? I was curious. I saw you on the news, and I wanted to see you again. Jack, I'm really proud of you. You've done something with your life. Oh, yeah. I got the medal to prove it. I got to go. Are you sure? I thought we could have drinks together. My afternoon's free. Mine isn't. Some things never change. Some things get better with age. Goodbye. I saw the kiss. Very hot. Got yourself a groupie? Do me a favor, will you? Name it. Don't talk, drive. [MUSIC PLAYING] Excuse me, mind if I sit down? Look, mister I'm-- Stensgard. Call me Carl. Well, Carl. Listen-- Oh, I understand. You're not here to talk. You got better things to do. But I just wanted to give you this. Carl's Gun World. CARL STENSGARD: Everything you want in a gun store and maybe more. Let me get right to it, detective, frankly-- and I say this with all respect-- your gun just isn't big enough for the job. I tell you, if it was me, with a 38 going up against a Mach 10. Well, sir, I would have run for cover. Look, Carl, may I call you Carl? Yes. I am not interested in buying a gun, OK? Buy? My friend, I want to give you a new pistol. Just come in and look around. Take your pick. And I'm going to throw in a box of shells and a new holster. But before you come down, just give us a call. I'd like to have some of the boys come down to meet you. You know, take a few pictures. Sign a couple of autographs. Or maybe you just want to hang around at my booth out at the gun show out at the county fairgrounds. Oh, I see, I see. You mean like a personal appearance. You got it. Thanks, but no thanks, Carl. I'm going to the bathroom. You got my card. Call me anytime. [MUSIC PLAYING] Stall's free if you need to make a deposit. Little too much to drink tonight there amigo? Can I call you a cab? Get lost. OK. Hey, how much you drink's none of my business. The guys in our line of work, we need to stay sharp. On our toes. By the way, that was nice shooting. What? You're the guy that wasted that cop killer. I saw you on the tube, Shepard. Hey, it's about time that our side give a little payback. Our side? I may not be LAPD. But in case you hadn't noticed-- Christ, who's next? Hey, man. We all keep the city safe in our own way, pal. Oh, I'm sure we do. Oh, just because you're on television, you think you can come down here and berate me. You're right. Hey, man. I'm not through with you, man. Yes you are. [MUSIC PLAYING] Buy that man a beer. [MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Come in. Morning, Lieutenant. You got a minute? [INAUDIBLE] you're early for a change. What can do for you? Well, I was talking to Hauser, and she suggested that I-- well, I ask you about-- What the story is on John Shepard? Well, you were partners and since he doesn't come with an instruction book-- You thought I'd give you a crash course. Yes, sir. That would be great. The only thing you need to know about John Shepard is that he is a hell of a cop, and you're lucky to have him as a partner. You will get used to him. I heard about a domestic you two rolled on. [MUSIC PLAYING] OK. We rolled on a call. Man with a gun. We pulled up, and this poor slob was standing in his front lawn. 38 in one hand, gin bottle in the other. Poor wife was on her knees sobbing. The guy was waving the gun around her head. John thought he could talk the guy in to giving up gun. His father drank. Said he had a lot of experience in that kind of stuff. I wanted to wait for backup, but a crowd was forming. Anyway, John started a dialogue with a guy. I though they were connecting. John asked the guy for the gun. He said, why? John said, so we can all just go home. Be with our family. The guy said, I lost my job today. Man without a job, is not a man. Man who can't support his family. He stuck the pistol in his mouth and just pulled the trigger. John came up to me at the end of the shift. He said, this job with break your heart. He didn't say much after that. That's when he started spending a lot of time in Venice. It's time to go to work, [INAUDIBLE] Thank you, Lieutenant. POLICE OFFICER: Jesus Christ, Lenny. It's him. I better call this in. You looking for me? Is this your room? You betcha. Sorry about the mess. Take your hand away from the gun, now. Well, you can make me if you're fast enough. You fast enough? Do what he says. You boys don't know what you're doing here, do you? I said-- [MUSIC PLAYING] How about you? OK, then. Why don't you hand me your gun, your wallet, and your badge. And, I don't know, we'll call it even. I can't. [MUSIC PLAYING] Nice place. Great atmosphere. They do serve food here, right Jack? I'll have two Cokes to go. So what's happening? Having a drink. You knocking off early today? I'm just sitting here having a drink. What are you doing here? Looking for you. We work together, you know? So? So, it's time to go back to work. What? Are we the only two cops in town? He killed two more of our guys. What are you talking about? Caultman and Banero. Valley division. Both shot at close range. I don't know about you, but I'd like to help settle the score for these guys. Yeah, good luck. No, I don't get it. There's a guy out there who likes to kill cops. Doesn't that bother you? ? Sure as hell bothers me. So? So, you're a police officer, aren't you? Look, kid. We all do our jobs our own way, OK? You call this doing your job? You know, how am I supposed to work with you? Why don't you just give me a little hint? How do you work with Hamada? We didn't? What's that supposed to mean? He was an asshole. Asshole? Why, because he got himself shot? No, because he was an asshole. Well, what does that make me? You know, when I heard I was going to be your partner, I guess it sounds kind of stupid, but I was excited. I thought I'd really get to learn something about the job, the street, everything. But I already know how to drink. Yeah. So far this isn't what I had in mind. Life is full of little disappointments. I'll be in the car. [MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] Maggie Hewitt. REX [ON PHONE]: What the hell are you guys doing down there sending me down all these old fogeys, huh? It's him. Slow down, Rex. REX [ON PHONE]: Slow down? Calm down. What do you mean calm down? I gave the old boy a chance, didn't I? I didn't want to kill him. All of a sudden he pulled on me. You see, I didn't have any choice. I couldn't let him kill me. You know, I got to tell you, things aren't working out for me quite the way I planned them. What do you mean, Rex? REX [ON PHONE]: What I mean is, killing old man and flunky cops don't prove nothing. I need a face the best. Why do you need to do that? Because the movies ain't going to make the story of my life unless I can prove I'm really the best. And I can't do that without your help. [MUSIC PLAYING] This is Lustig. I got a possible suspect vehicle on Cahuenga and La Mirada. Request backup. Come on, darling. I want to face that hero cop you talk to. Detective Shepard. He's the one. I want to meet with him and settle my claim. Then everyone will know, after which I'll let you interview me on camera. Exclusive. After you kill him. It'll be a fair fight. Oops, I got to go. This could be difficult, Rex. He might not go for it. REX [ON PHONE]: You can do it. You want the story, don't you? You have a nice day now, Maggie. DISPATCH OFFICER [ON RADIO]: Any unit in the area of Cahuenga and La Mirada. Suspect vehicle wanted in connection with officer shooting sighted. Respond code two. That's-- that's three minutes from here. Punch it. [SIRENS] This your car? Sure is. She's a beauty, isn't it? Got it from a boy back home. Runs better than a wet dream. Hold it right there, mister. I'm sorry, darling. Put your hands on the hood, slowly. All right, just don't pull that trigger. [BANGING SOUND] Told you not to pull the trigger. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANING] [SIRENS] Shit, he hit the tank. Get out of here. Get out of here. [MUSIC PLAYING] Thank you. DETECTIVE JOHN SHEPARD: Hey, partner, how you feeling. I'm all right. Got a little bit of a headache. But I'm OK. LIEUTENANT BILL CARPENTER: Here comes the chief. DETECTIVE JOHN SHEPARD: Here comes trouble. Sit down. So what the hell happened out there? Chief, why don't we wait and let them go home? Yeah, what are you going to do? You going to give me the report in the morning, right? No, I want to know what happened right now. Shepard. We responded to a radio call. Got there, suspect fired at us, we returned fire. Suspect escaped. That's it. That's what happened. How about you? You got something to add to that? Well, I never seen anybody handle a gun like that. It's like he was having fun. He was playing with us. Think we were very lucky to get out of there alive. Lucky? I'll tell you what. You're lucky that I'm not bringing you guys up on charges. Chief, the suspect opened fire on them as soon as they arrived on scene. Jesus Christ, did they have to return the fire. Backup was minutes away. I tell you what you should have done. You should have secured the area. And you should have looked after the safety of civilians. But no, you don't care about procedure. You just come in there guns blazing like you were in Dodge City or something. You guys just damn lucky that a stray bullet didn't hit some passing motorist or something. What were we supposed to do, Chief? Let him kill us. Hey, what do you want? Huh? You want off the streets? Because you're old public relations job is still wide open. Chief, this guy is a psycho. He enjoys it. It is Dodge City. For real. What does that make you, Shepard, huh? Wyatt Earp? [MUSIC PLAYING] [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] Fits that description. Yeah, better call for backup. Yeah, it's Siegel requesting backup on Mulholland Drive. Copy? [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] This is Fuller. We're too late. What do you got? Son of a bitch must have beat it out of here when a unit pulled up. And he's left us one hell of a blood trail. We'll find him dead in the morning. Some skinny ass bitch on a morning run will probably tip over him. No, I don't think we're going to be that lucky. This guy's not finished with us yet. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. REX [ON PHONE]: Rise and shine there, Maggie. You got things to do this morning. Rex, what's going on? REX [ON PHONE]: It's time. I want you to set it up. The way I hear it, you had your chance yesterday at the gas station. And you ran away. That was you, wasn't it? Now, you listen, all right? Listen. I just want to face the best. That's all I want. It's all I ever wanted. Now make it happen. [MUSIC PLAYING] Looking good, Shepard. DETECTIVE SIEGEL: All right, Lieutenant, we'll get on that. I'm going to take care of this. John, you got a minute? I haven't finished the report yet, Bill. Need another half hour. I need you now, John. We have a little problem. A situation has come up and-- All right, Shepard. You know they've got this new thing called dry cleaning. You got to try it sometime. If it ain't Mr. Metro. You drop any unarmed suspects lately? Not lately, John. But it's still early. You drop any bourbon bottles yet? Huh, super cop? Why don't you-- Come on, guys. Knock it off now. Sorry. A little while ago, Miss Hewitt got a call from our boy who unfortunately did not have the good taste to die from his wounds. He wants to have a meeting with you. Business or pleasure? He wants to kill you. LIEUTENANT BILL CARPENTER: Best we can figure out, as crazy as it seems, that son of a bitch wants to have a showdown with you. Do you mean he wants to-- Yeah, main street, high noon, the whole works. He figures you're our best. He shoots you, and that makes him the-- Fastest gun in the west. You got to be kidding. John, believe it. Look, can we quit dancing around, all right? Are you going lay this out for him, Lieutenant-- LIEUTENANT BILL CARPENTER: You know, Lieutenant, I was getting to that, OK? Miss Hewitt. I think it would appeal to his sense of Hollywood if we set this up on a Western Street at the old Premiere Pictures lot. LIEUTENANT FULLER: Of course we need you, John. You're the bait. Oh, excuse me. But what's he doing here? Well, the chief decided you guys needed some help. Cared enough to send the very best. Well, good. After we get him, maybe you can torture him for a while. LIEUTENANT BILL CARPENTER: John, knock it off. With metro as backup, we feel like we can contain the suspect, protect you, and avoid any problems with the public. Excuse me, Lieutenant. I was thinking, this guy may be crazy, but he doesn't act like he's stupid. I'm sure he's going to smell a trap. He's not just going to walk into this thing cold. Well, Mr. [INAUDIBLE] we think this is our best shot. But, hey, you got a better plan? We'd like to hear it. DETECTIVE: No, sir. I don't. LIEUTENANT BILL CARPENTER: John? This sucks. [PHONE RINGING] Maggie Hewitt. REX [ON PHONE]: So what have you got for me? They've agreed. Where? The Western Street at the old Premium Pictures ranch out in San Fernando. I like it. See you there. Wait a minute. Don't you want to know when? Why, high noon of course. Maggie, make sure you bring a good camera man. [MUSIC PLAYING] Is that your bike outside? Yeah. [MUSIC PLAYING] You're there? Yeah, John. You know, Bill. This is really stupid. I feel like I'm at the OK Corral. It's your call. John. If you want to pull out, you just say the word. DETECTIVE FULLER: Look, don't be such a chickenshit, Shepard. We're going to drop him the second he shows up. It's going to take the coroner a week to find all the pieces. You got nothing to worry about. And listen, Jack. Your first bottle of the night, it's on me. DETECTIVE JOHN SHEPARD: Thanks, Fuller. But I don't drink with assholes. You should have let me put one of my boys in there. He'll do the job. And remember, we give the suspect the chance to surrender. Understand? Surrender? The words not in his vocabulary. You know, I think they used to film The Rifleman here. Oh man, this dust is killing me. I am so dry. Look, he's 40 minutes late. We've been stood up. We'll give him to one. You're wasting our time, Bill. This gutless creep, he ain't going to show. This is Carpenter. We're going to give this guy another twenty minutes. Then we're going to pack it up. OFFICER [OVER RADIO]: This is [INAUDIBLE] We have a vehicle. That's a roger. Everybody on your toes. Suspect has entered the perimeter. John, you did remember to wear your vest, didn't you? Yeah, I got a diaper on too. Stop your engine. Get out of the car. Slowly. Put your hands above your head. Don't shoot. Turn around. Spread them. Who are you? I'm Tommy. I'm just doing a favor for a friend. What are you doing here? A favor for a friend, like I said. What favor? Returning the car. - What friend? - A guy. He came up to me at a bar in West Hollywood. The Ice Pick. Do you know it? He's not bad looking. He bought me a couple of drinks. I asked him over for dinner. He said he had some things to do, but if I could do him a favor today, we could get together. You're a real trusting guy, aren't you? Yeah, very. It's a dud. Bullshit, I don't buy it. Hey, look. I told you everything I know. No, no, no, I think he knows more than he's telling. You want to talk to us, don't you Tommy? Can he do this? Isn't this against my rights? Fuller, back off. What? Nobody told this boy his rights? I'll give you your rights. You got the right-- [MUSIC PLAYING] Get up. Come on, Jack. Jesus Christ. Hold on, Jack. It's 1 Adam 13, it's 1 Adam 13. Officer down, request ambulance. Olive and Broughton. LIEUTENANT BILL CARPENTER: Shit. Bill. Bill, shit. You get him? Yeah, I got him. I got him. I think I got him. You-- you are one hell of a driver. And you're one hell of a shot. You were never much of a shot. No, no, I wasn't. Was I? No. You're going to be OK. I got an ambulance coming. Stay awake, man. Shit. Shit, shit. Stay awake, OK? Hey, partner. Hey, partner. How are you doing? I'm doing great. I saw Sarah and the girls outside. How's [INAUDIBLE] He's going to make it. You stick with him. He's good for you. He's a pain in the ass. You're a pain in the ass. Open that drawer. Hang on to that for me, will you? Sure, pal. Now, go get that son of a bitch. You get me? I get you, pal. [GUNSHOTS] [MUSIC PLAYING] Rex. Yeah, it's Rex in flesh and blood. No thanks to you. I thought we were on the same road together. Huh, I thought we had a plan. Look, Rex. Shut up. Shut up. You know what? You lied to me. You lied to me. You set me up. It would've been so easy. You, me, Shepard, the camera. I shoot him. I win. You get your story. Everyone sees how fast I am. Hollywood comes a knocking. Oh, that's bullshit, Rex. Nobody cares how fast you are. Yeah, we'll see how much they care. [GASPS] [MUSIC PLAYING] Howdy. Now, I just want to talk. And I'll pull this trigger if I have to. But I just want to talk. Hey, barkeep. Can I get a [INAUDIBLE] over here? And for you? Make that just one. Thanks, Terry. Nasty business this afternoon. Things got sloppy. People died. That's not what I wanted. That's not what I'm about. Is there a point to this? Why, yes, Mr. Shepard. You see, you're famous. A celebrity. Something happens to you, it's news. So you see, if I kill you, I'm famous. That's what I want. You and me. What? Can't persuade you? How about if I throw Miss Hewitt into the deal? Huh? Don't worry, she's fine. She's fine. Now, you listen. You pick the spot. And we'll settle this once and for all. Now, I know my back is going to be a tempting target. But if you try anything, I'll know it. And I'll kill you. Because you can't beat me. Nobody can. Nobody can. [MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] Yeah? MAGGIE HEWITT [ON PHONE]: I've got Rex. Put him on. REX [ON PHONE]: So? The beach. 6:30 AM. Just north of the Santa Monica pier. [MUSIC PLAYING] Now, you wait a minute here, darling. [MUSIC PLAYING] Kind of windy out today, huh? You know, I've never been down here before. Been in town a long time but never been to the beach. Kind of like it. Might have to come down here more often. You wouldn't happen to have any buddies down here, huh, Shepard? Let's just do it. Shall we? Man's in a hurry. I like that. Now, this how it works. When I give Maggie the thumbs up. She yells lights, then camera. Then when she yells action, we slap leather. Couldn't get any simpler than that, could it? You do have another gun other than that, don't you? That's very nice. 357 snub nose. Don't have one of those. Now, why don't you take it out of your belt. Real carefully now. That's right. Put it right down by your side. All right. Now, when Miss Hewitt says, time's up, you aim and shoot. Are you fast enough, huh, Shepard? Are you fast? You sure are a gabby kid. Role them, Maggie. Goodbye, Shepard. Say those magic words, Maggie. Do it. Lights, camera, action. REX: I hope you got all that on film, didn't you? DETECTIVE JOHN SHEPARD: Hey. You cheated, Shepard. You bastard. I had to. You're too fast. Fast but stupid. Bullet proof vest. Standard issue. You have a good day, now. [MUSIC PLAYING] Cut. [WESTERN MUSIC PLAYING] Wow. That was weird. Like real life, huh, Shepard [LAUGHS]?? That was great. It sucked. I'm much better looking than the guy who played me. So what do you think, Jack? Here's what I think. [MUSIC PLAYING]
