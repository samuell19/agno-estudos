[ Man ] I don't know why, but I've always had... what I think other people would call delusions of grandeur. [ Laughs ] I always thought that if I'm gonna be a talk show host, of course I should be the top talk show host. I should be the biggest talk show host in the country. You could take the so-called best host on TV, and I don't view them as competition. Um-- [ Man #2 ] They don't do what I do. The way I do it? I don't think anyone else does it better. I don't think anyone's even close. I am so mad I could hardly see straight. And I seem to be the only one. I don't understand what the hell people are thinking. What's wrong with the established system? Fox News is propaganda for the Republican Party, MSNBC has become propaganda for the Democratic Party... and CNN is propaganda for both of them. What the audience was thirsting for was somebody to come out and tell the truth. We're supposed to challenge the government. That's the role of the media. So why did we pick the "Young Turks" name? Because it meant young progressives... looking to overthrow the established system, and that's exactly what we've been trying to do on this show, no matter whether we're on radio, online or on TV. So good night, everybody. [ Steve Oh ] The guy who sees things that other people don't see, who believes things that no one else believes, the guy who, some say, talks too much. The guy who has exasperated and inspired me for 30 years, Cenk Uygur. Today we are the largest online news show in the world. But I want to start at the beginning. This isn't just a story about us. It's a story about what can be done. That when somebody tells you that something can't be done, it's not true. Anything can be done. Everyone had to do this? God, it's miserable. Fuck. Cenk is a very smart, opinionated, bombastic, outgoing personality who has a lot of opinions and wants to share them with the whole world. Right away, um, I knew he was different. Most people either love him or hate him. And I didn't quite know where I fell on that spectrum in the beginning. I guess my first really formative memory was that Cenk was just pretty annoying. When I first met him, you know, he was kind of, uh, I kind of thought he was kind of a loudmouth, uh, which he is. Cenk likes to talk, and back then, he liked to fight. I don't know why, but ever since I was a kid, I've been obsessed with injustice. [ Swaluck ] By the time Cenk was in college, he was really into this politics thing. My first impression of Cenk was he was a complete jackass. He was the one that made class impossible to sit through sometimes, because you knew there was gonna be a fight, and you knew there was gonna be an argument, and you knew it was gonna be total nonsense. I would say he identified with the Republicans... and called himself a conservative, even though I don't think he really knew what he was talking about. He was probably the most conservative person I knew. He used to laugh at the bleeding-heart liberals. He always liked arguing conservative principles in class. I actually didn't disagree with some of the stuff he was saying. But what I had a problem with was the way in which he'd said it was so over the top, so outrageous, so embarrassing. He became kind of unbearable. I mean, I didn't see it, but he would tell the stories, and the stories themselves were unbearable. I kept raising my hand and raising my hand, and in the lunch break, when the girl sitting next to me said, "Why do you keep raising your hand? Why do you think you know something... that you just need to share with the rest of the class?" I said, "Because I think I'm right, and you guys need to hear it." First time I was on national television was on CNN. It was a show hosted by Greta Van Susteren, of all people. They had actually called for my roommate, because he was in Georgetown Law, and they wanted people in the back row who could contribute... as they had their guests on that were in law school. Well, I said, "Oh, he's not in, but I'm perfectly happy to do it." They shouldn't be interested in just winning. They should be interested in justice. And-And so the-the guilty are convicted, and the innocent go free. [ Uygur ] Are you interested in justice, Mr. Cochran? I mean, you went in there. You weren't a court-appointed lawyer. You represented a person which a majority of America thinks is guilty, and you helped to set him free, and you did it for money and fame. Are you interested in justice? I'm absolutely interested in justice, and perhaps I understand justice a lot better than you do. Justice in America is a strong advocate on both sides... doing their job, and-- [ Uygur ] It didn't have to be you. and a jury decides that. [ Uygur ] I never got back on that show again. He announced-- because Cenk likes to make pronouncements and announcements-- He announced that what he likes to do is have opinions and think about things... and then share them with the rest of the world. So what's the perfect job for that kind of personality? It's to be a talk show host. How do you be a talk show host? Well, you can get a start on public access television. Because it's public access, they're obligated to give anybody in the community a slot on their show. Like, "Really? In America, they have to give you your own TV show?" For free. It was the most amazing thing. ** [ Eastern News Theme ] * Young Turk * ** [ Singing In Turkish ] Hi, welcome to The Young Turk. I'm your host, Cenk Uygur. We're live on October 10, 1997. I fear we have an extraordinary show for you tonight. [ Uygur ] And I remember walking off that set thinking, "That's it. This is what I'm gonna do the rest of my life." Who's the one politician you'd most like to sleep with? What-- What kind of TV station is this? The wild and woolly Young Turk. [ Man ] When Cenk was doing his show, he was also working as a corporate lawyer... for a big firm in DC. [ Uygur ] My job was to defend corporate officers on their liability litigation. So when a CEO screwed someone over, screwed their own company over, screwed investors over, we were there to help them. [ Dogan ] I remember within a week, he was just calling me and being like, "This job is the worst." I felt dead when I was doing that job. When I do this job, I feel alive! [ Uygur ] I kept daydreaming about how I could be a talk show host. [ Koller ] And eventually he decided that he wanted to focus on that full time. I said, "I got a great business degree, I got a great law degree, I got an idea. Why don't I throw them in the garbage... and start a public access show?" - "Cenk!" - "Wh-- What?" "I heard about you! You better come in here and we're gonna have a talk right now." "So I heard you stopped being a lawyer and now you're doing TV. What the hell is TV? TV ain't nothing! TV's crap! It's nonsense!" We'd go to his house, and we'd always be uncomfortable, because he'd be like, "Kenan, what do you think of this crazy Cenk?" His plan was to basically live off of money from his friends and family. And I thought that was so selfish. I was, like, "Look, everyone wants to be a rock star. Everyone wants to be a movie star. You want to do it? Keep your day job. How much more do you want from your parents?" I thought, "What's the point of living if you don't follow your passion?" So I was not supportive at all. In fact, I thought he would kind of suck as a talk show host. We do a show basically centered around the news. But it's a lot of BS. The whole point is for me to yell and scream and tell you what I think. The show was-- It was bad. Uh, I just wanted to say I don't like your attitude. But, Norma, I love you, you know that. I hope it affects the issues. I hope I get people to think like I do. Okay, no, no, no. Now, you view it as negative, I view it as positive. Doesn't mean that I'm not doing justice to the issue. That's the beauty of The Young Turk. I'm getting the sense, Norma, that you're gonna disagree with that. Norma, I still love you! You know that! A nose job! And he loved espousing his conservative and Republican principles. In particular, Cenk just despised President Clinton. Bill, that's it. That's enough. Now, I'm looking for blood. I hope they prosecute your sorry ass... for concealing subpoenaed documents-- And then, when the Monica Lewinsky scandal happened, it was a hoot and a holler and I was having a good time. I did not have sexual relations with that woman. I just love the thought of Bill Clinton sneaking out in the middle of the night... as Hillary's sleeping-- [ Uygur ] I didn't have any problem with it. The guy's the president of the United States. He's the most powerful man on Earth. Can't he get a blow job every once in a while? But then I thought it was weird that the Republicans were taking it so seriously. And then they said they were going to impeach him for it. I said, "What?" You don't impeach a president for having an affair. [ Oh ] He didn't like Clinton, but he still defended Clinton... because he thought that the attacks were unfair. [ Uygur ] So I started to get a little disillusioned with the Republican Party... because they didn't really care about the principles. They just seemed to care about vindictive politics. That's a problem. What's up, Norma? Good. How are you? It has. Norma, don't think I've forgotten you. Agreed. See, Norma, you thought that there was nothing beautiful about me, that there was probably nothing you could agree with me on. But you were wrong, weren't you, Norma? Thank you. Thank you. I love to hear that. In a strange way, I kind of admire Cenk. Even back then. You know? He was going to make his opinion. He was gonna do whatever he was gonna do. He created quite a large, loyal, but very local following there in Arlington, Virginia. They actually were crazy enough to write a Young Turk song. And they are here to perform it live. [ Audience Cheering ] It was right out of, like, Wayne's World. [ Uygur ] Sing it for me. ** [ Up-tempo Ska ] This show is really-- I mean, you're intelligent, you're good on camera, and the whole show, I really like it. [ Man ] You ought to try to get this on one of the networks. Puts Oprah to shame. Young Turk should be-- You guys gotta go syndicated here. Absolutely. Couldn't agree more. I promise this show will go national. If it's the last thing I do, this show will go national. [ Oh ] Those fans become very loyal fans... because they know that even when he's saying... something that you completely and utterly disagree with, you respect him because you know that he's saying it from the heart. At every point in-in a show's history, there comes a time to take it to the next level. [ Uygur ] One day, I read in Broadcasting and Cable... that there is some new shows that they're trying... at this station in Miami called WAMi. [ Man ] What? [ Both ] What's a WAMi? [ Parrot ] WAMi 69. [ Uygur ] And then I found out one day... that they were auditioning for entertainment reporters... on their main show called The Times. I said, "That's it." [ Koller ] He got in his car and drove down to Miami. [ Dogan ] Show Time's now. Here's the new big man on WAMi's campus, Cenk Uygur. I had my first interview here at The Times, and it was with my favorite female brad--broadcaster of all time. The irrepressibly sexy Connie Chung. It's still a male-dominated profession. People like you. [ Mankiewicz ] He couldn't read the prompter. He was sweating. He was nervous. And you know, it's like, it's not normal sweat, it's Turkish sweat, right? - Back to you, Ben. - Thank you, Cenk. Welcome aboard. Guys, excuse me. Don't push me. He was horrible on the air. I mean, it was a train wreck. [ Uygur ] Did you relate with Lester Burnham at all, or did you-- Of course. Mm-hmm. How about-- I think everyone will relate to Lester Burnham. Uh, what made you come out and talk about the ridiculous rumors... about your, uh-- about the-the gay situation? I-I-I-- You know, I've discussed that about as much as I care to. [ Mankiewicz ] Everybody was incredibly uncomfortable. So let's kick him back to sales, or we'll get rid of him. That was the biggest gut punch I've ever gotten in my career or in my life. I was devastated that night. I was-- because I was, like, so hopeful! I had finally made it on air, on television, on this station that I liked. And then it got yanked away in a day and a half. God, it hurt. [ Mankiewicz ] But you could see it was well written. He just had interesting opinions on everything. Really interesting opinions. Different than other people. I was like, "No, let's just have him write." So, uh, I definitely owed Ben that job. And we started writing the show together. And next thing you know, I started producing the show. Next thing you know, I started doing on-air commentary on Friday about politics. Here now, a man never lacking for an opinion, Times pundit-- that's what we're calling him-- Cenk Uygur. Cenk, we're going to start talking about George Bush. Is it legit-- [ Mankiewicz ] When I met him in 1999, he said he was a Republican. [ Koller ] When Ben started explaining to Cenk... why some of his so-called Republican conservative views were not quite right, Cenk actually listened to him. Friends from New Jersey were saying this to him for years, but he-- he didn't listen to them as much as he listened to Ben. I wanted to be for Bush since I'm a Republican, and I voted for John McCain during the primaries in Florida, but he lost. I think you have to be un-American to vote against John McCain. [ Uygur ] I thought, "This Bush guy is just not that bright." Expectations are so low, all I had to do is say, "Hi, I'm George W. Bush." [ Audience Laughs ] He was scared, because it was the first time he was ever gonna vote for a Democrat. And Ben was like, "I told you. You're not a Republican." If he hadn't done that, man, his credibility would have been shot for so many years in the future. I think it would have really harmed him. [ Woman ] Uh-oh, something's happened. George Bush is the president-elect of the United States. He has won the state of Florida, according to our projections. [ Man ] Vice President Al Gore has called Governor Bush... and retracted his concession. [ Uygur ] Al Gore, for the love of God, stop. Bush won this election-- I mean stole this election, fair and square. Let's be done with it. I voted for Gore, but there comes a time when you gotta bow graciously. Otherwise, I think you ruin your chances in 2004. Our station has been purchased by the Spanish-speaking network Univision. Now to honor the-- our new employers, The Times has instituted a brand-new tradition-- the mid-show siesta. Ah, que bueno. Maybe this sale thing's not so bad after all. [ Uygur ] We didn't speak Spanish, so we had to get a new job. I thought, "I gotta go back and get my own show." Cenk came out to LA, and then he wanted to set up this company, The Young Turks. [ Uygur ] Problem is, again, on a national level, it's nearly impossible to get your own TV show, so I had to go into radio. [ Radio Announcer ] Wouldn't it be great to hear exactly what you want on radio? [ Uygur ] I went and talked to Sirius Satellite Radio, and a guy there said, "Make a couple of audition tapes, send it to us, and if we like it, we'll put you on the air." And I did it by myself, and it was pretty good. So we're at the bar, and Cenk says that he's done this show, and it was okay, and "it was a little tough to do on my own." And I'm like, "Yeah, I'd love to do a talk show." And so I asked Ben, "Hey, do you want to do a radio show together?" We sent it to Sirius, and they said, "All right. We're gonna put you on." But if we went to a radio station, it was gonna cost so much money, we couldn't afford it. So we set it up in my living room. We brought in Jesus as an intern, but he didn't know how to do anything either. You have this idea that, "I'm gonna do this internship. It's gonna be at a studio. It's gonna be fancy. I'm gonna have to check in." [ Uygur ] He says that when he walked in, he's like, "This is some dude's living room." I don't know how serious this is. This can't be real. [ Uygur ] I met Jill Pike in 2001. I thought she'd be perfect for the show. [ Pike ] He started talking to me... about this radio show that he had created... and he was hosting and that it was big. He was this big talk show host. And I said, "Oh, really?" 'Cause when I thought radio show, I thought, like, big studio, and, you know, major microphones. It literally-- It was almost like two cans and a wire. [ Koller ] I actually was a radio talk show fan. I like talk radio. When I saw that I had a job that I hated... and that he was starting up and needed some help, I decided, "You know what? Let me take a chance." I'll just quit my job, drive out to LA, help him do this and help him start it up. [ Godoy ] When I first met Dave, I realized that he didn't know more than I did. Then you find out he has a degree in geology, and you're like, "Seriously? Geology? And you brought him--" And he has, like, arguably the worst people skills in America at various times. [ Uygur ] "Your friend seems a little weird." And I said, "He is." So when I moved to LA, I didn't want any of this bullshit fooling around. I want to work as much as possible so that we can get this thing off the ground. [ Uygur ] At some point, someone at Sirius realizes, "Oh, these guys have a radio show on our station. I wonder if we should pay them. I wonder if we should keep them." [ Koller ] They agreed to give The Young Turks... a live daily show on their political talk channel. [ Uygur ] That was a big moment for us. And so we moved from my living room to a really small office, and it was tiny, but it got the job done. [ Man ] I was brought on as an intern. I was like, "Well, let's-- any kind of broadcast, let's see what it is. It's political? Eh, I don't care about politics, but let's see what happens." [ Uygur ] Michael is a guy I've known ever since I moved to LA. [ Michael ] We had fun. I enjoyed it. But I didn't get it. I didn't know what was going on. I knew that I was going over to talk on the radio... and that this would somehow segue into something for all of us. I mean, that was the idea. [ Uygur ] I met Wes Clark Jr. at a fund-raiser for his dad when his dad was running in '04. And then I said to him, "You know what? You sound great. So you want to come and guest host our show once?" And he did. I just remember thinking, "What the fuck is this guy's name?" Like, 'cause I-- "Chink," "Jink," "Zinc," "Sync." I mean, I didn't-- [ Dennis Miller ] And your name is... Cenk Uygur. Nicely done. I'm sorry, Cenk. I'm sorry. Cenk wanted to get on TV so desperately. Where was the political bias? Where was everybody screaming about the political bias... when they savaged Clinton over Whitewater, which turned out to be fictional. And I didn't see the conservatives complaining about political bias then. They went after for Clinton for eight long years. [ Audience Applauds ] Clinton's a great guy. He never did anything wrong. We apologize, um-- He got a surplus. He got us a great government. He didn't invade countries illegally. He just had sex. And you know what? I don't mind that. I'll take that any day. He's a good match for you. So after a couple years of doing the radio show for Sirius, Cenk had yet another one... in his series of epiphanies, announcements and pronouncements. The way to go is not TV, it's not radio, it's video online. I had this idea that I was positive that the Internet and TV would merge, and that when they did, that we should be right in the middle of it. [ Pike ] If nobody's gonna put us on the air, then we'll put ourselves on the air. People weren't doing what Cenk had envisioned at the time. [ Mankiewicz ] I was not part of that conversation. But I reacted to it like I think a lot of people did. Like, "No, you don't want to do a show on the Internet. That means you didn't succeed." There's nobody, really, who had an ego. Well, there was Ben. [ Mankiewicz ] I thought, "Okay. I don't really want to have to do anything for it." I just wanted to do the damn show. I liked doing the show, but I didn't like all the stuff that went with it... and this constant sort of notion that whatever we were doing was not enough. My fellow citizens, at this hour, American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations... to disarm Iraq, to free its people, and to defend the world from grave danger. When he suggested attacking Iraq, when Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11, I couldn't believe it. It was the craziest thing I'd ever heard. Forty-three percent of Americans... believe that Saddam Hussein was personally involved with 9/11. That is the worst failure of the mainstream press I have ever seen. Ever seen! Our original idea was that we'd talk half about politics, and half about J.Lo's ass. That was what we always said. That was our line. And then we went to war. Killed thousands of American soldiers... and hundreds of thousands of-- of Iraqis, and, like, it seemed a little ridiculous to spend half the show on J.Lo's ass. It is inexcusable that the people do not take these-- No, this-- Absolutely it is. You know, your argument, Michael, I mean, I hate to do this. But it's so tired, blaming the American people. [ Pike ] And the show became much more heavily focused on politics. We had, you know, I think what we thought a higher purpose... than just sort of, you know, yammering on and on about, you know, whatever we wanted to talk about. We really have to investigate why isn't it a bold-face headline... on the cover of Time, Newsweek, New York Times, Washington Post? [ Uygur ] They don't do it! You're talking about one story. The stories that are in the article... are never goddamn mentioned in the goddamn headline! You know, it's-- it's impossible to talk to you about it. No, because-- Here, I'll show you. I was always playing the straight man to Cenk's over-the-top. "USA Safer, Bush Says." Okay-- USA Today, you suck balls! Pretty hard to be the co-host when one guy is at that decibel level. But it was genuine. He was mad. Goddamn it, they've failed us! And if you're not angry about that, Michael, and any of you out there, then you're goddamn wrong! 'Cause you should be angry. Young Turks. When they started torturing people, it's like, "Oh, this party has gone from bad to hideous." Quickly thereafter, I was embarrassed that I had ever been a Republican. If you asked me to vote for a Republican, I'd say, "Yeah. Yeah, that's a good one. [ Laughs ] That's a good one." Now Cenk was really obsessed with being the mouthpiece for the liberal blogosphere. Because you're a Republican prick. He would come in every day looking for whatever crap he could say... about abuses that George W. Bush was doing. Unitary executive doctrine, uh, in its mildest form... claims the president has the power to appoint, control and remove executive officers... and interpret the law as it pertains to his office. That means one ruler to rule us all. The whole fucking country was designed to avoid that! His sort of natural bigness, sort of-- I thought was sort of taking over the show. And I'm a bad partner for that. I sort of withdrew from his vitriol when he was getting so angry. Jill didn't, and they were starting to bicker more. I wanted Jill to focus on more of the pop culture news... and less of the hard-core political news. [ Pike ] But his belief was that only a select few of people are really interested in politics, and you're gonna get a wider audience if you start talking about some of the fun stuff. And I just didn't trust his vision. You know, I thought he was making a judgment on me. You know, like, "You're not smart enough to be on the show, so we're gonna put you on some of the more softer content." [ Uygur ] She thought she would rather do the whole show, or, I think, not the show at all. I wanted to prove myself, you know, that I-- that I was smart and that I could absolutely, you know, fill a role in the political conversation. And so I decided to move to Washington, DC, and just stick with politics. So you're telling me that August 15, you're done. You're going to DC. Moving to Washington. Mm-hmm. Wow. I'll be there. I originally got hired as a temp here at TYT. Okay, sounds good. So it's a win-win for everyone. All right. I feel like I'm in an episode of The Office. Right around then, Jill was leaving. So we decided, "You know what, Ana? Why don't we try you on the other side of the camera?" This is Ana Kasparian, if you've never met her before. Hello. [ Uygur ] She wound up becoming one of our co-hosts, and as everybody knows, now is an absolutely integral part of the show. You may or may not agree with that rundown, but look at it and change the order so I can let Jesus know. Oh, you stole one of my stories. We'll see what happens. Our contract with Sirius comes up, and they love the show, they're going to renew it, and they're offering us a quarter of a million dollars, which is fantastic, more than we've ever gotten before, we were really excited about it. At the very end of the contract talks, they say, "Oh, one little thing. You're not allowed to do online video. You're exclusive to us, and obviously you'll stop that." And I said, "I don't want to stop that." They said, "What are you gonna do? Turn down a quarter of a million dollars? You're gonna do what we tell you to do." I have never doubted somebody more repeatedly through my life than Cenk. And I turned it down. [ Koller ] All those years when we were not paid or underpaid or lowly paid. It was such a grind working at TYT. I always had those moments where you feel like "What am I still doing here?" Now, did we think he was crazy? Not in year one. Not in year two. Maybe year five. Year six, there started to be like, "Wow, this is really gonna take a while." [ Oh ] Who can do that? Who can just come to this country and just say, "You know, I'm going to be a talk show host," and then just become one? We didn't believe in him. It ain't easy, man. And if you're ever pursuing your dream, and it's against long odds, there are going to be moments where you feel alone. And I guess the only way to get beyond it is just to push forward. How in the world am I gonna do this without any money? 'Cause we had to keep doing the show. We were gonna sell clips of the show on iTunes, we were gonna do merchandising. All these things that never wound up happening. Instead, what wound up happening was YouTube. YouTube? Who goes on YouTube? [ Godoy ] Back in early '06, you know, video streaming was just coming to birth, and the view count was horrendous initially. But we had nothing to compare it to. The whole idea that we would do a show and it would be cut up into YouTube clips, I was a part of that when that started happening on the show. I wasn't involved in any of those conversations, and I didn't buy it. I didn't believe it. I didn't care. I'm like, "Why clips?" And then after the show, Cenk was-- gathered everybody around, talk about what clips to take. And I'd be like, "Whatever." I mean, I'm so-- I'm such an idiot. It's so great. I just-- The whole thing, I missed. I mean, I was literally a part of the YouTube revolution, and I was totally out of it. You know what you start with online? Zero viewers. Flat-out zero. You know what your lead-in is? Zero. You know what our marketing budget was? Zero. Okay? And we all we had was the TYT army. Our fans are really, really supportive of what we do. Almost to the point where you can call them overzealous, and in a good way. In a good way. When I heard you guys wanted us to send videos, I was like, "Of course! Of course I need to send a video." TYT reports the truth, even if it's hard to stomach. And I always felt like I was getting the real story, a full-picture story. For the first time, politics, you know, it-it clicked in a way that it had never before. They talk about the influence of money on politics. They talk about the actual interests of the politicians themselves. You guys care about the facts, but you also just keep it real. Cenk keeps it-- nah-- keeps it real... whatever the hell that means. Right now, I think the media is fundamentally broken in this country... 'cause they don't serve the audience. They serve other constituencies, such as advertisers, corporate interests, et cetera. Hence, they're not being honest with the audience. This deficit commission, I mean, it's beyond a joke. It's a slap across the face to middle-class Americans, saying, "We don't give a damn about you. We're coming for you." This is class warfare. You never hear people in the regular media talk like that, do you? Now we're gonna be this much of a sucker... that we're gonna sit here and let them take more and more from us? Oh, hell no! [ Oh ] This guy, on this little, brand-new, rinky-dink Web site called YouTube, is speaking truth to power. That is when The Young Turks really start to gain... that critical mass of followers online. This award is given to publicly known figures who tell it like it is. And is there anyone more deserving of the Emperor Has No Clothes Award than Cenk Uygur? [ Applause ] [ Oh ] So the TYT fan base was growing very rapidly. It got to a point where whenever Cenk and I went out somewhere, someone would recognize Cenk. Do you mind if I get a picture? [ Uygur ] No. I don't mind at all. What's your name? [ Oh ] Sometimes they'll approach and say, "Oh, uh, excuse me. But are you Cenk Uygur, The Young Turk?" I'm like, "What?" I had no idea about what Cenk was up to... after we finished that class. Uh, he was somebody I didn't really much think about... until one day, randomly, all of a sudden, there he is. Is this some kind of joke? This-- This is like the biggest scam. I mean, this was somebody who was a right-wing kook. [ Uygur ] Now let's go in the opposite direction... and go to hate voice mails left on The Young Turks answering machine. [ Man #1 ] Fuck you, son of a bitch, motherfuckers, cocksuckers, fuck you. [ Man #2 ] Somebody ought to torture your goddamn ass. The things that Cenk has said on the show... seems to be more fueled by passion than the facts sometimes. My side is right. The other side is wrong. And it just was opinion. I-I don't read the YouTube comments, and I never have, and I never will. And anybody who reads them and bases any decision on them is a fool. When you argue with people, and you're against their beliefs, they get mad. They don't suddenly say, "Oh, there's some common ground here and we'll work it out." They get pissed off. That said, when I do read a comment about me and it's positive, I think that's awesome. [ Lewitinn ] I think Cenk now is-- he's more entertaining to watch, especially if you're on whatever side he's on at the moment, and he's your cheerleader, then it's cool. [ Kasparian ] For years after I started at TYT, we were like this happy little family, and we did our thing every single day for, I think, about three years after I started. I need people to understand what's going on. Okay? Over the last couple of weeks, for example, we've been averaging 600,000 views a day. Beating most of the cable shows in America, just on our YouTube channel. When the YouTube money started kicking in, we're like, "Oh, fantastic. We can actually grow the show now." [ Oh ] I could see Cenk's excitement and enthusiasm, and I was very happy for him. At the same time, I wanted to be part of it. [ Uygur ] Steve came on later as our, uh, chief operating officer. [ Oh ] He needed someone to help handle the business side of the business, because Cenk did everything. The network is growing. There are more and more shows. There are more and more employees. [ Man ] I'll say it's the same from the YouTube perspective, when I have to tag title thumbnail clips, and it's midnight and 1:00 AM and stuff. Like, I'm just trying not to fall asleep, and, like-- It's just not as good work. It's just not. Yeah, I need you-- everybody to buckle up, right? Because it's gonna be really hard either way. And also with the members, these are people who are paying. They're paying because they want to support us. So maybe, you know, if we go in a different direction, I think that we may lose some members. If someone brings good evidence, I'm the most open-minded man in America. Cenk rides the line and goes back and forth all the way in either direction... of being very humble and being very, uh, confident. For the life of me, I can't remember who said it, but I was talking to a reporter, and they said, "So, uh, are you guys the largest online news show in the world?" And I was like, "Oh, shit. We are." Okay? And that's fucked up. Okay? That's awesome. That's it. We're the largest online news show in the world. So everybody can tell us how our ass tastes. Okay, we fuckin' rock. Okay? Three hundred million fuckin' people have watched our show, which is un-fucking-believable. When you walked in that living room, if they said to you, "300 million people are going to watch this show one day," would you have believed it? When Cenk makes a really big statement, I really think he does believe it. He needs that motivation, he needs to give a football coach speech. We are the largest online news show... in the fucking world, okay? We're there right now, okay? We are one of the largest... online news commentary shows on YouTube. W-Would it have been better if I came in and said, "You know, golly gee, wouldn't it be great if we were the 17th largest online news show?" I mean, that would have been absurd, right? So we set a high standard, and we met it. We're gonna tell everybody... until everybody writes, "Young Turks, largest online news show in the world." And I-- Like, when I say things like that, I don't know whether to believe it or not, except apparently it's true. I don't really believe those speeches, but he needs those speeches. -He gives them all the time. -I think that's what drives him. Even though it's not always true statements, they're statements that keep him going and keep him striving to be the best. [ Uygur ] We've been doing this show a long time-- over six years now, from Sirius Satellite Radio to YouTube. And throughout, these Bush guys scared the hell out of me. We have made it. America has survived. Barack Obama... is the next president of the United States of America! America, it's good to have you back. [ Shure ] We were all just drunk with happiness the night Barack Obama won. We felt like we had accomplished something. And I'll never forget that feeling. It almost makes me well up thinking about it now. It was such an exciting moment. By people who waited three hours and four hours... because they believed that this time must be different. [ Uygur ] Barack Obama is going to agree to do offshore drilling. Why is this a terrible idea? Since then, what has happened? The president has already authorized... 10 more deep-water drilling expeditions in the Gulf of Mexico. Those wells are going to continue straight ahead. It isn't just about offshore drilling. It isn't about any single issue. It's about the fact that you never fight. And he's in the process, actually, of becoming a puppet of big business. This is not the second or third compromise. This is the 128th compromise. In a row. I have two words for you: predator drones. [ Audience Laughs ] You will never see it coming. I-- This is not the Bush administration. This is the Obama administration. It's not that Bush didn't do this. It's that Obama has expanded it. "Change you can believe in." [ Man ] It's mass murder when you say, "We're going to bomb this area because we believe a terrorist is there." Twenty-one women and 14 children. Those people were murdered by President Obama on his orders. [ Uygur ] Look, the system is corrupt. It has corrupted the Democratic Party. I'm-- I'm not going to support the Democrats. If anything, I'm going to attack the Democrats 10 times more. Because there was the faction within the progressive movement that said, "No, no, no, play nice. Uh, they will deliver and they'll win, and they'll do this and they'll do that." Well, they didn't, and they lost. Now I can't have you sitting there going, "Oh, he doesn't like the Democrats. He must like the Republicans." No. That doesn't make any sense. We have to start doing it on our own. And if any politician doesn't agree with that, rip them down, man! Rip them down! And I don't care what party they're in. But if you're hoping against hope that Obama will do the right thing... and the Democratic Party will do the right thing, well, that hope got extinguished tonight. It's over. So we had elected President Obama for change, and we were so frustrated that we didn't get that change. And apparently he didn't hear us. So we've got to get to the place where he actually hears us. And what does he watch? What do all the politicians in Washington watch? They watch cable news. Now Cenk had another one of his series... of big announcements, pronouncements and epiphanies. And now he said, "Well, the evolution from being an online video... is to make a TV show. How are we gonna get a TV show? We're gonna get on MSNBC." It went all around back to 1996 when he thought that he was going to go straight onto TV. MSNBC has opened up its 10:00 time slot. They are looking for a new host in that time slot, and they say they do not have any leading contenders. I would like to officially announce my candidacy for that spot. [ Koller ] His idea was to make a grassroots effort to get all of our loyal fans... to pressure MSNBC to hire Cenk. This is our moment. They sent in e-mails, they sent in pictures of them holding TYT and MSNBC signs. [ Oh ] Eventually Phil Griffin, who's the head of MSNBC, called Cenk for a meeting. Phil wanted to get Cenk on the air and try him out as a guest host. Participating with us tonight, Cenk Uygur, the host of the progressive talk show, The Young Turks. Good evening to you both. Thanks for trying this. Thank you. [ Man ] Bring in our panel, blogger, host of The Young Turks, Cenk Uygur. Cenk, I always have a hard time with your last name. One of these times, I'll get it right. The biggest reason that Cenk, I believe, is where he is today... is because the audience knows how authentic and sincere... his commitment to actually pursuing... an agenda that moves this country forward is. It gives me great pleasure, Cenk, to introduce to America the Youngest Turk, Prometheus Maximus Uygur, ladies and gentlemen. Anyway, congratulations. [ Man ] Congratulations. Thank you so much. Pro's brought me a lot of luck, 'cause ever since he was born, a lot of great things have happened in my career. [ Oh ] Dylan called to see if Cenk would fill in for him... while he was out on vacation. In America Today, Wall Street is exacting its own revenge on the Democrats... by withholding campaign donations. [ Oh ] After that, Cenk started filling in for Ed Schultz as well. Welcome back to The Ed Show. I'm Cenk Uygur, The Young Turk, sitting in for Ed Schultz. He'd fill in for whoever was not there. [ Oh ] Cenk was doing great as a fill-in host, but it doesn't really count unless you have a contract, and he didn't have a contract. He was not getting paid, and it just dragged on and on and on. [ Makeup Artist ] Our show and MSNBC. That's the only game in town. Wow! No one has offended the 9/11 victims' families more than Glenn Beck has. And so, you know what? Ground Zero is hallowed ground. I'm sure conservatives would agree. Now normally that fill-in thing takes a lot longer, except we're murdering it, right? Like normally, they'd want to try somebody out forever-- [ Jackson ] Oh, I see. to feel comfortable, right? But they feel a hell of lot more comfortable... when you're tripling CNN's ratings as a fill-in. Okay? So, we'd have to fuck it up somehow, which is entirely possible, but given this trajectory, it's the sound of inevitability. Right. Okay. Cenk, did you see that hilarious headline? No. What? "Ed Schultz Drowns In Turkish Bath." [ Uygur ] Oh, for fuck's sake! Who wrote that? Do you get why that Politico article is so damaging? Do you really think it's that damaging? No. It's not damaging. It's awesome. No, no, no, listen. Come on, guys. Think about it. If-- Is Ed Schultz gonna want me to fill in for him... if there's articles about how I did better than him in the ratings? That's why I told everybody, "Do not compare me to any other MSNBC host." That's a terrible idea. All that's gonna do is piss off MSNBC. Because that's not an interesting lead that I beat Ed Schultz. What's interesting is I beat CNN and Headline News combined. A fill-in host beats CNN and Headline News combined. That's fucking interesting, right? Anyway, all right, we gotta get started. [ Man ] Would you define Hamas as a terrorist organization, or is everyone on the side of these guys, supporting terrorism? Okay, hold on, Jordan. Let me answer, right? Ahmadinejad was elected too. Is he great? [ Uygur ] What am I gonna do? First of all, he cheated. No. And it was-- That doesn't mean they're not a terrorist organization. Oh, for the love of Christ. Is this guy ever gonna let somebody answer? Our government, my government, your government. No, no, no. Shut up. Shut up. Okay. Listen. You asked me a question 28 times. I'm in the middle of answering and, "Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!" We're worried about what MSNBC is gonna think... because of the way Cenk handled that interview. That's the only thing I'm concerned about. Because when you, as a host, tell someone you're interviewing to shut up-- I mean, of course, if you're the head of a major network, that's gonna raise a red flag. My opinion is that guy needed a tall glass of shut-up juice, okay? And I have zero problems with telling him to shut the fuck up. Because he wouldn't shut the fuck up. I started with trying to have a real conversation with him, right? And he wouldn't do it 'cause he's a fucking dick. In real life what I would do is say, "Now shut the fuck up, and I'm gonna tell you what it's about." They don't do that on television, and that's why television is boring. Okay? And Bill O'Reilly does do it, and you might think he's a dick, but he's also number one on television. We're just worried because we're slight pussies, right? And we're worried about MSNBC. Am I right or wrong? Can I say one more thing? Do you think "shut up" is fine? One thing that I noticed is he was really good at playing the... "I'm a calm, levelheaded individual. [ Hanc ] Yes, yes. And this individual over here is getting outraged and going crazy. Look at how unreasonable and illogical he is." Exactly, exactly. Right. Now, people do that trick all the time. That was a trap. Right, that's a right-wing trick, right? I don't think it's that big a deal to lose your temper over that. Like, do people consider it quote, unquote "unprofessional"? Because that's just what we're used to on television. For everybody-- For all the hosts to be fucking milquetoast. To say, "Oh, yes, well, then let's be very calm and quiet... and I'll let you roll over me with a fucking steamroller, because you won't shut the fuck up." And you know, "Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah," and tell all your points, okay? All your points that you keep repeating without answering the fucking question. Well, then I'm gonna steamroll your fuckin' ass. Everybody, earmuff the kids. Go take your bullshit, wrap it up and put it back up your ass! Sick, sadist fuck! [ Oh ] So over the years, Cenk has said many things on video that are, to put it lightly, controversial. Did we lick your ass enough? Then we're gonna ask you have you had it in the mouth, and then-- Aw, come on. [ Babbles ] I'm totally turned on. [ Grunts ] I can't believe you said-- I can't believe I said that. He would rip anyone, anyone that he thought was selling out, anyone that he thought was being unfair or unjust. Our media sucks balls. They take two giant balls. As much as you-- And put 'em inside their mouths at the same time. And some of those people who were attacked were people who worked at MSNBC. By the way, I spent all of yesterday trying to avoid Chris Matthews. Every time I saw him, I was like-- [ Oh ] Why? There's a great chance he saw one of our clips on him, which were horrible, right? [ Laughing ] We're going to destroy Chris Matthews. When the Republicans were in power, Chris Matthews sucked up to them. Now when the Democrats are in power, he sucks up to them! No, you idiot, you're a tool. You child! I didn't want to destroy Chris Matthews. He made me do it. [ Oh ] So our concern was that if MSNBC brass... ever came across these videos, that Cenk's tenure at MSNBC would be over in a heartbeat. Assuming that there were no floating time bombs on the Internet about me. [ Hanc ] Right. Then, yeah, I would get hired, because I am gonna get good ratings next week, and that's how it works, and you get hired. I'm not trying to, like, be humble or anything. I'm saying, there's a million land mines. They're gonna go off at some point, and TV's gonna get scared, right? All the shit we've said? It's fun. It's good. It's good television. So television will be scared. You're not gonna give it back to the American people, are you? They put it every year. Every single year that comes out of our paycheck! We put it in, and you're saying we were suckers! [ Mimics Phone Ringing ] He wants to talk to you? Yeah. [ Mimics Phone Ringing ] [ Mimics Phone Ringing ] [ Laughs ] Is there any chance you'll ever do Olbermann? I'd be kinda scared to fill in for Olbermann. I know that's a funny thing to say. Even though it has light parts of the show, it's so serious, I'd be afraid of screwing it up. Maybe I'm intimidated by Olbermann, and I'm afraid that if I do his show, he's gonna look at it and go-- Good evening from New York. I'm Cenk Uygur. Keith Olbermann has the night off. You tried to reach out to Republicans and didn't really fight back... on some of these issues that you think you should have gotten credit for. Or maybe we just need more people listening to your radio show, Cenk, and they'd get the-- they'd get the true facts. Look, I-- They wanted me to rip his fucking mustache off of him. [ Oh ] And they're right. [ Koller ] We're in a new stage, Dave. We're building bridges as opposed to burning them. But don't worry. Once we build them-- All I'm saying is that's all Obama and all those guys are saying. No, no. [ Cenk ] [ Laughing ] [ Koller ] Then in early 2011, Keith Olbermann leaves MSNBC. This is the last edition of Countdown. Good night, and good luck. From the moment Keith Olbermann started, we were on his side. So I feel good that we have done our job in supporting others. Now it's our time. Our prime time schedule here at MSNBC has been rejiggered to take account... of Keith Olbermann ending his run on Countdown this past Friday night. [ Jon Stewart ] Olbermann was a five-tool player: rage, ego, wit, scholarship and, most of all, bombast! Is there no one on MSNBC that can shoulder this Olber-burden? [ Uygur ] Then in the middle of January, I got a call from Phil Griffin saying, "Hey, listen, I need you to be ready to go on the air fairly consistently." They say at the beginning of the year at some point, they want to give me a show. [ Kasparian ] Oh, wow. It looks like this move to New York... is inevitable, right? - It's a matter of when. - If I get a show, we're definitely moving, like, all you guys. Is there anybody who wants to stay in LA? [ Godoy ] It was a lot for me to think about. I'm married. I have a house. I have all my family here. The upside is, if I get a show, we're not gonna run out of money. [ Koller ] Hey, hey, be cool. All right? So, I'm just concerned that, you know, we're gonna rely on MSNBC stuff, we're gonna do less TYT stuff, and our audience is gonna dwindle down. We have to be like De Niro in Heat-- walk away in 30 seconds. If we go to MSNBC, we never lose track that we're TYT. That won't be us. [ Koller ] That won't be us. He sees TV as... making it. Like, if you're in TV, that's the end-all, be-all. And I think that online kind of has the stigma... of not being credible, and he wants to be credible. [ Interviewer ] How do you feel now that you're kind of at the verge... of having this dream come true? I always think of that scene in Miracle, that goofy hockey movie where Kurt Russell's the coach, and he works so hard, et cetera, and when they finally beat the Russians, he goes off by himself in a hallway and is just, like, "Yes!" Right? And I've always dreamed of that moment. If we get a big fat TV contract, and we think that's gonna be great in a lot of ways, that'll definitely be a bit of a, you know, Kurt Russell moment. And I'm telling you, before you know it, I'll be back on your TV doing a national show. I guarantee it! [ Koller ] He goes to New York to do a show every day. [ Oh ] Being with MSNBC was good and bad. We wanted to give Cenk more credibility, have his name be more well recognized. Yay! There it was. The downside is he had to film out of New York City. Hello, hello. What's going on? Let's hope a good show. [ Man ] Fifteen seconds. Stand by. [ Chris Matthews ] That's Hardball for now. More politics ahead with Cenk Uygur. [ Director ] Three, two, one. Fade up, mike cue. Welcome to the show. I'm Cenk Uygur, and I've got news for you. [ Register ] I was very excited because... he's on television, you know, instead of me going home and be, like, "Oh, yeah, I work for The Young Turks, you know, uh, Cenk Uygur is a--" And they're like, "Who's that?" And I'm, like, "He's on MSNBC." "Oh." He's been doing the 6:00 PM Eastern time slot. So it's been awesome because it's getting TYT a little more exposure, and... that's a good thing. Thank you for watching this show. And Hardball, which is excellent, starts right now. Good show. All right, have a great weekend. The advantages of old-school media are awesome. [ Interviewer ] Yeah. Like flying business class. Uh, getting driven to places you want. Our fans felt that, you know, MSNBC was number one, and TYT was number two, and Cenk was not giving our show enough time and effort. And it was true. By the time that his show ended, he had to just haul ass, set the equipment up, and then, you know, dial in and work with Ana, and just chemistry was just not quite there. It just sucked. It was not a good show at all. A lot of our members dropped out. It was a really bad time, in my opinion. Guys, I know some of you are frustrated members and stuff. Believe me, we're busting our ass over here. Thank you so much for your patience. [ Godoy ] The longer he's in New York, the more we're thinking, "What's gonna happen to our online show?" All they need is Cenk. They don't need us. Are we gonna move? And if so, when are we gonna move? When should we start looking for places? Let me preface this by saying there's a lot of good news/bad news. Phil Griffin, he seems pretty intent on, uh, having me in New York in the long run. I guess that's good news in that I am much more likely to be hired. Like, always mysterious. Always cryptic. We never know what's happening. All right, here's the sense I'm getting, uh, from the LA studio. This news is not well received. [ Oh ] I have to believe that Cenk was biased, because he was getting paid by MSNBC for the first time in his career, and without MSNBC, he was back to his tiny little salary. You know, now he's married, and, you know, he has a child and he needs that money. I felt that he was making excuses to stay at MSNBC. [ Interviewer ] How do you like New York? Living here. If I had time to breathe, I'd rather enjoy it. Doing both shows is tiring. We moved The Young Turks to the morning. So far that's worked out pretty good, because then I get more energized and excited... [ Phone Chimes ] about doing the show. And-- Oh, God. [ Phone Chimes ] The level of stress on him during that period of time, from what I saw, was beyond the amount that any normal person should ever agree to endure. I don't have any time to read. I gotta read these e-mails. I gotta read these texts. I gotta listen to the voice mail. I think the executive producer is outside the door. I gotta talk to him. And I was supposed to read all these articles. [ Chimes ] And then there's another text. What am I supposed to do? Right? [ Woman ] I'm very worried about him, to tell you the truth. Because he's a man in his 40s now, and I think he's got an incredibly stressful job. Because he takes it so to the heart. This is his life. He lives this from morning till night. I spend about five minutes a day in here when I'm not working. [ Laughing ] So-- If that's the dream, I'm not sure it's that great a dream. I wish he could have his family with him, but it's just the way things are that they can't be. Hello! Hey, baboo! [ Babbling ] [ Laughing ] Ah-ooh. Ah-ooh. [ Uygur ] He can't crawl forward, but he crawls backwards. Maybe he's already a Democrat. [ Uygur Laughs ] So he sits there and watches me when I'm on. But Wendy says that when other hosts are on, he's, like, "Mmm." And when I'm on, he's like-- [ Chuckles ] [ Prometheus Babbles ] All right. Good night, baboo. [ Wendy ] Good night, Papa! Good night, baboo. [ Oh ] I get a call from Cenk. He says to me, "You won't believe the meeting that I just had." [ Interviewer ] Hey, how are you? Hey! Welcome home! How's it going? How was your day? Good. It was an interesting day. Yeah? Yeah. What made it so interesting? Well, I had a meeting with, uh, the head of MSNBC, one that has some interesting ramifications. Anyway, bottom line is, Monday I'm back in the studio. You guys fucked up. I'm coming for ya. [ Interviewer ] How does it feel to be back in the LA studio? Yeah, fucking awesome. Is there gonna be any interesting announcement or anything today? We do have traumatic news today. First of all, let me tell you something... that will not go out for a long time. Monday-- Okay, this is totally confidential. It goes nowhere, okay? Uh, the head of MSNBC... talked to me and said, uh, he heard from Washington that I'm being too harsh. [ Uygur ] He talked about how, uh, outsiders are cool... and they wear leather jackets and they ride bikes and, uh, he'd love to be an outsider, "But, Cenk, the reality is we're not. We're insiders. We're part of the establishment. And you gotta start acting like one." I couldn't quite believe it. I sat back thinking, "This is like out of a movie. Who says this stuff?" Honestly, the thing that they hate the most... is when I keep saying all the politicians are corrupt. Right? They're all bought. They're all bought. They fucking hate that. [ Uygur ] They're Team Obama, man. So they hate it when I criticize Obama. Hate it. He started to get that look, the same look that he had at the law firms... where I knew he couldn't bear it anymore. And I said, "Oh, my gosh. He's gonna quit." [ Clark Jr. ] They hired him for who he was, but if you're not gonna let him be who he is and tell the truth, fuck 'em. [ Oh ] Instead of quitting, he said, "That's it. I'm just gonna do the show my way." I'm not gonna listen to this. I'm gonna go balls to the wall. Okay? But what he did was he started attacking the president... much more than MSNBC was comfortable doing. If President Obama is doing the wrong thing, I'm not gonna tell you that he's doing the right thing, so I can, quote, "Support him." Please, no more half measures. This country elected you because you ran on the message of "Change." Instead we got pocket change. Now if it's not good enough to pull us out of this rut, then they're gonna say, "Progressive ideas didn't work." Have the courage to give the American people the change you promised them. [ Uygur ] When it came time to make a decision... on who was gonna get the 6:00 show, Phil called me in and said, "Hey, Cenk, we're gonna go in a different direction." And they're gonna move him to the weekend and give that spot to Al Sharpton. But resist we much-- we must, and we will much... about... that... be committed. They offered him some bullshit, early weekend morning spot, but actually at double the pay. Over a million dollars over a three-year contract at MSNBC. But I viewed that as a demotion when it was totally not warranted. He didn't get what he wanted, and he thought that that would sort of tarnish him... as sort of losing the 6:00 slot and being banished to the weekends. He knew that the MSNBC opportunity was an experiment. [ Oh ] I said to him, "It's a lot of money. There's no shame in taking it. Okay? You worked so hard to get here. You're here. The other thing you can do is to say, 'Take your money and take your bullshit weekend spot and stick it up your ass.'" Burn this bridge. Build new ones. I thought that if I went on MSNBC... and we were in that little box in the Oval Office, and in all the congressional offices, that we could make a difference. But what I didn't realize at the time was... those decision-makers don't give a damn. [ Uygur ] Interesting news. Here it is. I am out at MSNBC. Cenk took an incredible risk. Cenk walked away from guaranteed dollars at a cable network. I wouldn't have done what he did. A lot of people, when you're presented with, you know, the money on the one hand, and, you know, "You'll have money, you'll be treated well, you'll have access," and then to give it up because they're douche bags, I think is phenomenal. You know? 'Cause so few people do it. In this fickle world of, uh, of television, any sort of change in the hierarchy at MSNBC... could have brought him back into favor quickly. If I take the money and I get a reduced role... and I just, you know, do whatever I do with it, and maybe I even rise up in the ranks again, what's the point, man? They offered you more than you were currently making for a smaller role. Yeah. You know, that's an interesting point. It's like hush money to shut you up and keep you off the prime-time airwaves. Watching Cenk do his MSNBC exit speech of why he left, and it reminded me of Network and Howard Beale's famous speech. And Cenk's not a lunatic, but he was crazy enough... to turn down a million dollars to keep on saying exactly what he wanted to say. That was the moment that I realized that I wanted to be a part of TYT... and that Cenk is like a leader that I have never encountered. The point of the show was truth telling. That's what we're supposed to do, and we're supposed to challenge the government. That's the role of the media. He has been part of MSNBC's nightly lineup since the beginning of the year, trying out for a permanent slot. Cenk Uygur, known online as one of The Young Turks, is a two-fisted liberal who isn't afraid to throw some punches. Those are the guys that are sucking off of you. So here's something else they should suck on: Our rage! When Cenk left MSNBC, MSNBC said the reason why... they did not give him a full-time contract was because of his style and his tone. Cenk said it was the substance. [ Man ] "Cenk's claims are completely baseless. We did have numerous conversations with Cenk about his style, not substance. It's unfortunate that he's decided to depart in such a negative fashion." I don't want to work for an organization that says, "Hey, take it easy on Washington." You have made that clear. That's the opposite of what we do on The Young Turks. Don't your employers, if you're gonna work for an MSNBC, have every right to say your style needs some adjustment? Why does that tick you off so much? Howard, if I thought it was about style, I'm not turning down the money! It was about substance. They say, "Be the establishment." I can't be the establishment. I gotta tell people the truth, which is that the Democrats and the Republicans... are here to screw you! They're about to cut Social Security. They're about to cut taxes on the rich. It's insanity, and who on the air is saying it? [ Oh ] When Cenk went to the press, it got a lot of attention. Current came calling very soon thereafter. [ Olbermann ] Former host on our rival cable news network MSNBC... claims he was told he had to have more Republicans on his program... and that he lost his nightly slot and was offered only a weekend role instead. We're joined on his first night freed from the mainstream media. Good evening, Cenk, and welcome to the alumni association. [ Laughs ] Thank you, Keith. I appreciate it. Many of Current's fans and employees... were suggesting very loudly... that Current go out and grab Cenk. It's not right. Can you imagine this? I actually have to cut you off. I don't know why this all seems so familiar to me. Great, thanks. Good luck. We'll be in touch. All right. Another fun day. [ Koller ] So Current called Cenk, and they went through the negotiations, and that proceeded in a way that the MSNBC didn't. MSNBC was obviously giving him a runaround. Current was obviously serious about it. [ Oh ] When Cenk first told me about this Current opportunity, my first reaction was, "No way. Don't do it. We just got through this MSNBC debacle, and I don't want you to join another media company where they're full of shit, and they're gonna stick you in a box where you can't succeed. Don't do it." Welcome to Current TV, Cenk. I've been waiting to call you my president for a long time. [ People Protesting ] [ Oh ] That's not how you do it, dude! [ Pop ] [ Laughing ] That's how you do it, okay? Television, we're coming! [ Oh ] Uh-- Look at this prima donna. It's alcohol. [ Koller ] Current set up a whole studio... in Los Angeles. [ Koller ] No, get together. What do you three think about this studio space here? It's all right. All right. Three minutes out. [ Uygur ] Our first TV show. That's The Young Turks, okay? Not some Cenk Uygur show on MSNBC. This is The Young Turks. It's coming in two minutes. T minus two to launch. [ Interviewer ] [ Uygur ] That's a good sign. That's a good sign. [ Laughing ] [ Interviewer ] Yeah, I'm ready. We've been doing this for years. TV, Internet, doesn't make a difference. You get in front of the camera and the microphone and you talk. [ Stage Manager ] Five. [ Cheering, Whooping ] Welcome to The Young Turks. We've got an awesome show for you tonight! Who are we? Well, we are proud and progressive. There's no question about that. And we are here to punch the establishment in the mouth. [ Uygur ] I realized after a while that the media... is only successful if they're on the side of money. If they're not on the side of money, all of a sudden, look at that. Shows wind up disappearing from MSNBC. So what's more important... is actually affecting the outcome. This one right here. [ Driver ] This one right here? Yep. All right. Okay. [ Uygur ] Because the corporations... control everything. Money decides everything, right? What about the-- [ Dogan ] I know. What's above the Supreme Court? Mm-hmm. The Constitution. You have to get an amendment. Okay. Sounds really, really hard. I know. The advantage of the amendment... is that you can go state by state. You have to get three-quarters of the states, right? Okay. You just start, and you build momentum. [ Dogan ] I am. Okay. That's it. I have an announcement. [ Crowd ] I have an announcement. Our politicians are bought! Our politicians are bought! Who bought them? Who bought them? The corporations did! The corporations did! [ Uygur ] When the Occupy movement came around, we decided that we were gonna launch WolfPAC. [ Oh ] The goal of WolfPAC is to vote for a Constitutional amendment... that says that corporations are not people, that they cannot buy our politicians. [ Uygur ] Super PACS are political action committees, right? And when you think of PAC, I think of wolf pack, right? I wanted people to know how aggressive we were gonna be. The founding fathers put it in Article V of the Constitution, because they said at some point, the federal government will get too corrupt. The states have a right, if two-thirds of them get together and say, "Hey, we want a convention to get an amendment... to fix what's happening in Washington." This is the way. - We can fight back! - We can fight back! - We will fight back! - We will fight back! And we will win! And we will win! [ Crowd Howling ] I used to watch him on TV every day, and he was so cool. I said, "How's this guy be on TV?" I knew they was gonna get you. I knew it! And then they took him off the air. And then they put Al Sharpton, man! I mean, come on, man! - [ No Audible Dialogue ] - I think most people realize... there's something deeply, fundamentally wrong with the current system. [ Uygur ] I think that it is the right time, and if we do it together, it's definitely doable. And we are gonna do it. God, I hope, I hope WolfPAC takes off and they pass that amendment. I really do. [ Interviewer ] I hope so. I-I think-- No. I'm a firm believer that any real progressive... or radical change always comes from below, not from above. Great job. Great job. I'm just so proud that the kind of message... that you guys are putting out there so effectively is being put out there. It's great. This is a lovely house with a lovely backyard, and I enjoy it every day, 'cause I think, "It could be gone tomorrow, the minute I burn the next bridge." [ Laughs ] [ Interviewer ] Is this the first time you've ever owned a house? No, no. We don't even own it. We're just renting. My career is way too unstable to ever own a house. [ Laughing ] Like, we might one day, but if I actually buy a house, then, uh, apparently we've reached some stability at The Young Turks... that seemed previously unimaginable. [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Uygur ] We had, oh, interesting news at The Young Turks. Uh, Current Television, for which we have a TV show, has been sold. Going once, going twice, sold to... Al Jazeera English. You sold Current TV, the network that you cofounded, to Al Jazeera for an estimated $500 million. Was that always just an investment to you? Maybe I was naive. Oh, no, no, no. I thought it was something that you had an ideological interest in. Absolutely. As an independent network, the only independent news and information network, we found it difficult to compete in this age of conglomerates. [ Uygur ] So today was the last show for The Young Turks on Current TV. Bye-bye! [ Uygur ] Obviously what'll happen is an interesting question... and one that I do not have the answer to. But I-I'm happy that we're now moving on. [ Koller ] This sad and depressing cave is the former studios... of The Young Turks on Current. [ Whooping ] After the sale of Current TV, we needed to get out of there, we needed to find a facility. We went to this gorgeous studio that YouTube set up here in Los Angeles... while we built out our own studio back in Culver City. All right. What's up, what's up, what's up? Cenk, we've got the perfect line for you. Then more prep, more prep, more panic. We do one more dry run, and then... showtime's at 6:00-- we go nuts. [ Uygur ] While we were at YouTube Space LA, we wound up crossing over a billion views. So we had this big party... because that just feels like a number that's undeniable. That we reached people. We actually reached them. [ Stage Manager ] Two, one. Wait a minute! Where are we? This isn't our regular studio! Because we're celebrating our one billionth view. I gotta be honest with you, I'm a little amazed by that. Our story in a lot of ways is the story of online media. Uh, we've kind of grown up together. As we've found success, I think online media has found success. I think it's a symbiotic relationship. What people can't wrap their heads around... is that online is now bigger than TV. Yeah, of the one billion views, I think my family was only 980 million of those. So we really couldn't have done it without you guys. All right, we love you. We got a show for you tomorrow. We'll see you then. [ Man ] * The Young Turk Show * All right. [ Man ] All right. Could I conceive of working for, like, a CNN? No. I have no interest in that. Because when you're on TV, you have to be fake. They make you fake. There's 28 different notes from producers, from management, from corporate parents, from advertisers. I got no interest in that. Like, my long-term goal is to beat CNN. We're-We're gonna be larger than CNN. I'm not worried about the resources. We're gonna get resources as we grow. And eventually they're gonna have to take them out on an ambulance like that. [ Oh ] The guy who has exasperated... and inspired me for 30 years, Cenk Uygur. [ Crowd Cheering, Applauding ] The answer isn't, honestly, the strength of our personalities or even the strength of our shows. It's the strength of the idea. The idea that you could serve the audience and be honest with them. And we can change the media in that way. I don't view this billion views... as a culmination, as the end. It's a great moment, but we're just getting started. Here's to TYT, and here's to the next billion. [ Cheering, Applauding ] [ Uygur ] Moving into the new place was rough, of course, 'cause we're The Young Turks, and we always start out slow. But the upsides are huge. I love being in our own place. I love that we've got this new home. [ Clark Jr. ] I'd like it to stay the same. You think, "Oh, it'd be great if we were huge"... and everything else, but then we'd just become a bunch of assholes. I think that his priorities have changed from... him being The Young Turk to The Young Turks. That he has a family. He has a company. He has a lot of other people that he has to think about, not just himself. I definitely miss The Young Turks from 2003-2004... when, to me, it was in its glory days. But our situation now is, of course, much better. We have technology. We have experience, we have a staff, we have resources. [ Register ] It's the same guy, just a lot more polished, but a little more to lose. If Cenk's career goal... is ultimately to be relevant and impactful... as a national broadcast identity, I believe every decision that he's made up to this point... continues to make him more relevant in that way. I don't know if Cenk has made a difference. I don't. I don't know if talk show hosts can make a difference. They generally preach to the choir. Yeah, you'll get a couple of people who accidentally come across and they go, "I agree with what he has to say." But in the end, who's gonna watch it anyway? It's gonna be people who agree. All my life, people have been telling me... how I can't do things. It turns out they've been wrong all along. I'll tell you what I dream about. I dream about sitting on a porch with Pro. He's all grown up. We're talking about politics like my dad and I do, and we got the amendment passed... and hopefully it set the country on a little better path. And to be able to be proud of my career... and proud of our audience that we did all of this together with. If we can get that done, I can't ask for anything more. The Young Turks just seemed like an accident. Now it's this-- Now it's an accident... that sort of just, you know, turned Cenk into this really vital, important voice... in this country. You guys ready? Welcome to The Young Turks. I'm your host, Cenk Uygur. Guess what kind of show we have for you today. An awesome show. Closed-Captioned by Captions, Inc., Burbank, CA
