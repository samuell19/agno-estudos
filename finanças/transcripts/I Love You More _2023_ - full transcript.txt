We will soon go to America and everything will be better. - Why can't we all be patient? - About what? - About moving. - What? - Do we have to move right away? - Yes, because we will lose our chance. - We won't lose anything even if we go at the end of August. - So I keep working in the basement? That's what you want for me? My work will finally be valued. - It's valued here too. Quite a lot. - Don't speak nonsense. - I don't want to go to prom. - What? What are you saying? Everyone likes going to prom. - Well, I don't want to. - Ben...! Let me try this on you again. I just want to see if it fits. Are you acting like this because I changed your collar? - I just don't want to go. - Why not? - Because I don't want to. Why don't you understand? - Because you're behaving like a child. Let me finish this because I have too much work. - Of course you do, it's only work for you. - Ben, don't misbehave. - I don't want it. - What's the matter with you? I make clothes for everyone and I can't do them for my own son? Benny... You don't want to leave your friends? - It's not about that. - About what then? What's keeping you here, Benny? Tell me what's the problem? Is it maybe for a girl? or is it... for a boy? This is why you don't want to move? - I do want to, just not right away. - So when? - He doesn't live here. If we move in July I won't be able to meet him. - I will speak to your father, but first you go to prom, okay? - Where are we going? Dad? Mom? Dad, please stop the car.

Please, don't forget to talk to dad. - I won't forget. - Please... - All right, I won't. Now go and have a good time. Okay? - We have a good opportunity to start a new life in America. But him... - Maybe... we should let Ben speak. Ben? Listen, Ben is a teenager, during this stage of hormonal change his body is exploding with emotions. But this hormonal change has nothing to do with his sexual orientation. - What does she know? Nothing. Get the hell out of the way! - You wanted to go there. - Please don't start. - Then don't yell at the traffic. It's not their fault. - Not at all, except my own fault. - Does it really need to be someone's fault? - She didn't even know what she was talking about. - What if she does know? - This is why. - What this is why? What? Are you trying to say he took after me? - Enough now! - That s my fault? - Enough, Or actually it's my mother's fault like always? Shut up! Enough! Have you lost your mind, eh? Have you lost your mind? - Leave me alone. - Why don't you ever care what I think? It's always you that knows it all. - I don't, But at least I'm trying to understand.. - We can't let him destroy his life. - So what do you think we should do then? - We have to show him the right way. - Which way? Which one? What if we don't even know what that is? - Don't slam the door. - Where are you taking it? Mom? - I have no choice. I don't want to move without seeing you first. - You will help me somehow. Maybe I can come and visit you in America. - I mean, you to hold me now. - Then kiss you. What else? Kiss your neck Then make my way to your ear Tell you I love you. and you will feel my own breath and then make my way down to your chest you feeling the depth of my tongue on your skin - Ben - Who is it? Hello? What kind of test? - It's part odf the procedure. The sooner they get done, the sooner I can get the flight tickets. - So about that... - What happened? - It's only that... - What happened? - Nothing, never mind. No. We have few unpaid bills and your dad wants them paid before we come. - So why didn't he pay them? - He couldn't because he hasn't been able to selle any paintings. - I still need to find an apartment for you. - I know. Trust me. I know it's the last request before we unite again. - Okay, I'll let you know tomorrow. I have to go. Say hi to dad. - All right. Bye, bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Did you tell Nita? - Not yet. She's working a lot and I don't want to burden her with this too. - I'm sure. I don't blame you, but she is his sister and maybe she can talk to him. Hey... what about your mother, how is she? - I don't know. I didn't have time to go and see her. - You have to find the time because you're leaving. Don't leave like that. - I know, but who is going to finish these dresses? - Benny... - Hello. - How are you, my sweetheart? - I'm well. - How handsome you looked for the prom.

What's the matter with you? Don't walk away when I'm speaking to you! Open this door! Why are you locked in? I want to talk to you. - You know very well why! - What do you want me to do? Why are you doing this to me? Why can't you think about me? - Are you guys thinking about me? - Why do you think we're moving? So you can have a better life. - Better for yourselves! - I'm going for myself? Since when am I doing anything for my self, eh? You should be ashamed. All the work I do, that's the way you thank me? Look at me! I'm not the enemy. Don't destroy yourself. Stop daydreaming. - Better to dream than to lie. - Who is lying to you? - You and your husband. - Ben Ben... - Ben My beloved grandson. What brought you this way? How is your mom doing? - Working, like always. - Working, working. She never stopped working.

I love you and I hope to see you very soon. She always loved knitting. She used to sit right here. and she would knit. I would sir next to her and watch her for hours making clothes. When she would go and check the food cooking on the stove, I would take her needles and try to knit. I could never get it right. Your uncle used to tease me for messing up her yarn, but she never cared. She used to say you learn from your mistakes There is one mistake she never forgave me for: running away and marrying your father. I'm not saying I regret marrying your father I just wish I had her blessing. I didn't want to lose you the same way she lost me. - I'm sorry... I just... - Sshhh... You don't need to. - Come in. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Do you need anything washed? - I don't think so. - Did you pack everything? - Yes, everything. - Is everything okay? - Yes. - We need to practice our English now, right? - Mom... I love you. - I love you more.
