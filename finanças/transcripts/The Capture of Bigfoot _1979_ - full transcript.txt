[MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC THE FRIENDS, "MY SPIRIT RUNS FREE"] [HOOTING] We've only got one thing to worry about now, and that's getting this critter back to civilization and cashing in. [LAUGHING] [WHINING] Shut up, you little beast! That's sure some smell. Smells like decaying flesh, that's what. Ever smell a human's been dead a couple of days? I don't care what it smells like. We're gonna be richer than [INAUDIBLE]. How we gonna handle this, anyway? Handle what? People are gonna start asking questions when they see it. Nobody's going to ask any questions. They'll be too busy trying to figure it out. We're trappers, ain't we? I guess so. But we sure trapped us something different. What was that? What? Thought I heard something. Aw, it's nothing. I sure don't like the way that thing sounds. You sound like an old woman. [BARKING] [CHOKING] [CHIRPING] [BUZZING] [ROARING] [BARKING] Whatever happened with old Bob Pearson? That shady, crazy son of a bitch. Bald headed feller he was. Talked all the time. Jake, Jake! Isn't that Hank Wells? Stop those dogs! Come on, grab them! Hold it! He's still alive! Get him in the truck, and I'll take him over to Johnson! Come on! Come on, let's go! Be easy with him, please! Come on, move! Get him in here! Take it easy with him. Come on, get him in here! Good lord, what happened? Come on, move. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Is it OK if I ride along with you, sir? You know, Hank Wells is my best friend. Where was Hank trapping, Jake? All I know is the last time I talked to him, he said him and John Harrow was going up to the Lake of the Clouds area. Can we go, sir? He's in awful bad shape. Get in. I'm gonna ride back with him. Hello? Dave, is that you? No, it's your friendly game warden. I overslept. What time is it? 10 minutes to 8:00. Is Jimmy out there? No, he's headed down the highway with his new birthday present. Where is that independent little cuss off to now? He's getting to be unmanageable. Little brat. Well, now, now, he is your little brother. Well, I told him not to leave without telling me where he's going. Oh, don't look at me. I'm a mess. And I've got 10 minutes to get to work. Now, wait a minute. Elsie's Cafe is not going to be taken by storm if their favorite waitress doesn't show up. No, no, I've got to go to work. Mr. Olsen, you think it would be OK if we went in and seen if he was all right? Why don't you check with the doc first? Hank. Can you hear me, Hank? Hank, what did you find? What got you? [COUGHING] Critter. What critter? Where? Uh, Hank Wells. What room you got him in? Just a minute. It was gonna make you rich, Hank. What? Hank! Hank what was it? What was it, Hank? Was it [INAUDIBLE]? Hank! What are you doing in here, Mr. Olsen? I'm just concerned, Sheriff. That's touching. Hank worked for me, remember? Did he, uh, say anything? No. [GUNSHOT] Did you get him? No, he's back in the hollow log. That's the third time! That same lousy snowshoe! When are you gonna learn how to shoot? I know how to shoot. My fingers are frozen! You always have an excuse. Now go in there and flush him out! All right, all right! Dave Garrett, you're rotten. You're probably right. You know how much trouble I'm in? Mm-hmm. The cafe's open, it's jumping, and Elsie's best waitress isn't there. Break 10 for Timberline Base. Come on back, Timberline Base. It's Humphrey Bogart's double. Here's looking at you, sweetheart. Now, stop it. You know how mad Sheriff Cooper gets when you kid him. Break 10 for Timberline Base. Come on back. This is Timberline Base. Come in. Sheriff Cooper here. Steve Garrett isn't there by any chance? Why, yes, as a matter of fact, he is. Ahem. Garrett, I hope I didn't disturb your coffee break. Can you get your tail up the trail? This is Sunday. It's my day off. Well, push yourself. It's important. 10-4. For Must be important. Bus is leaving. Hit and run, hmm? Move it, Garrett! Jake! About Hank. What he said in the car-- I think we'd better keep that between us. Matter of fact, I think the less said about this, the better, you understand? Well, here's looking-- well, here's looking at you, kid. That's better. That's right. Here's looking at you, Coop. Damn it, Garrett. Don't you ever knock? I just dropped Karen off at the caf and heard about Hank Wells. What can I do for you? You're a forest ranger, ain't you? You take care of all those furry little creatures, like Smokey the Bear, don't you? Come on. Get to the point. Well, looks like some of your woodsy friends did Hank in. You think an animal had something to do with this? Dave, somebody got mauled out there in those woods. When I saw Hank-- no human did. Looks like it's your baby. What do you got for facts? Two men, one a mess, the other still missing. My guess, pack of wolves, maybe a killer bear. Bears are out there hibernating. Hell, I haven't seen a pack of wolves since I've been here. I'll see what I can do for you. Yeah, OK. You do that. Hey. Try that on for size. Well, like I did, after that, the problems kind of settled down, and folks mostly forgot about it. But I've got a feeling in my bones we're in for a heap of trouble now. Oh, come on now, Jake. You ain't gonna tell that old Indian legend again, are you? Well now, Jace, I don't remember telling you nothing. I was talking to him. I was recollecting some facts. Facts? [LAUGHING] Facts? You ain't had no straight facts since cow kicked you in the ass, you old fool. But I'm gonna give you something. Now, me and Jason here, we've been up in that territory trapping. That's a fact. Mm-hmm. And we're still around. And that's a fact. So you just gonna have to move your superstitions off to the north 40. Superstition my ass. You young punks make me so damn mad! You come in, you hang around the country a couple years, you think you know everything! Well, I'm telling you, you don't know nothing! I was there! All right, Jake, take it easy! Look, have a drink. We was just joshing you. Watch your heart. I know what I'm talking about! All right! You do! Watch your heart. [LAUGHING] You sons of bitches! I'm getting tired. You're always tired. It's going to take us an hour to get back, you know. So what? Now come on. [ROAR] [SCREAMING] Did you hear that? Yeah. [ROARING] You could tell that morning when you went out there, something bad was gonna happen. Oh, it's 27 years ago, and I remember just like it was yesterday. No, wait a minute. That wouldn't make it 27 years. Hey, Jake? Can I see you a minute? Sure, Mr. Garrett, I guess so. Let's talk over here. Sure hope this visit isn't official. You've been poaching again, Jake? No. No, you know better than that. I need your help this time, Jake. It wouldn't have nothing to do with what happened to my good friend Hank Wells or old John Harrow, now, would it? As a matter of fact, it does. I tell you, I don't like it. I just don't like it at all. It's too damn close to what happened 25 years ago. Now, wait a minute. Maybe it wasn't 25 years ago. What-- Will you hitch up your team and give me a hand? Yeah, I guess I got to. Hank Wells is my best friend. Yeah, I'll go. When do you want to leave? 7:00 AM sharp, your place. Me and my dogs will be there. Thanks, Jake. See you later. Now, you know what I'm after. Dead or alive. You get $10,000 on delivery. That sure is a lot of money, Mr. Olsen. But then again, that's an awful lot of risk. You know, that's pretty mean country out there, especially this time of year. And according to what's been going on around here, they don't take too kindly to some people. Well, you boys have been on rough trips before. Besides, as far as this animal is concerned, you're much better off than Wells and Harrow. You know what it can do. Now, that's a comfort. I'm offering you a lot of money. Money ain't doing Hank and John much good. That's right. Their stupidity could turn out to be your gain. If you've got the nerve. Well, it's an ill wind blows nobody no good, Mr. Olsen. But if you don't mind my asking, why are you so interested in this thing? I mean, $10,000? That's a heavy price just to pay for superstition. Superstition? No. Besides, that's my business. Look, I'm not forcing you boys to do this. What makes you so sure it's not superstition? Only other person I ever heard talk that way is old Jake Turner. [LAUGHING] Jake? Yeah. Nobody ever believed his stories but him. Do you want the job or not? You make it $5,000 up front, you got yourself a deal. You boys certainly do drive a hard bargain. You've got a deal. Well, Arak is-- or was-- a large, furry manlike creature who supposedly protected the Arak Indian tribe who inhabited the Lake of the Clouds area. Go on. It watched over the ancient burial ground of the elders, and they worshipped it as God. It always escorted the elders away when it was time for them to die. It was never known to do harm. About 30 or so years ago, there was an incident. It was documented in all of the local newspapers. A geological survey crew went into the Lake of the Clouds area. Seven men were killed. Off and on over the years, there have been sightings of the creature, but nothing ever happened. And you mean you never heard of the legend before? Nope. If it's true. You mean you still want to go out and go hunting? Sure. Maybe we'll see something. See something? Come here. Watch this. Ugh, stick it, chicken. I'll go by myself! Aw, come on. You don't have to get so sore. Whoa. Whoa! [INAUDIBLE]. Hey, baby. Them tracks are leading right through the swamp, Mr. Garrett. I think we better take the dogs around, see can we pick up the trail from the other side. Anything you say, Jake. Whoa! Whoa, baby! Whoa there! Whoa! Whoa, baby. Easy. Whoa! Easy there. [BARKING] Good God. I'll go get a blanket. [BARKING] Hey, Jake. Come here and take a look at this. What do you think of that? How about this? [INAUDIBLE]. We gotta be getting out of here, now. [BARKING] [ROARING] What's the matter? What's the matter? I gotta do a 10 100. Jesus. Hey, Bert, come here! Yeah. Footprints! Yeah. Human. Whoever is out here must have took his shoes off. What the hell's going on here? Wait a minute. Them ain't human. Get your rifle. Hold on a minute, Bert. There's something strange going on here. See, now them's human, but them there, they can't have nothing to do with what we're after. Why not? Well, they ain't big enough for what we're after, first place. I mean, Bert, somebody's trying to pull a fast one on us. This is a joke. Well, we're gonna find out. Well, why worry about it? We've got enough money. It's just a joke! If it is a joke, it's on Olsen. Then what the-- why-- what are we doing out here freezing our tails off out here, for God's sakes? It's just some kids trying to play a joke on us. I mean, for-- we could have a ball with that money! I ain't never seen nothing like that in my life. What is it? It ain't as big as what he said. But it'll do. [GUNSHOT] You got him, Bert! I got him! [INAUDIBLE]. [ROARING] [ROARING] Looks like it's back in your lap. Yours and mine, Dave. You trying to tell me that an angry bear bent that rifle? That was a deliberate killing. Nothing conclusive. [INAUDIBLE] waiting on the carnage board from Jackson. Well, how's Hank wells? You talk to him yet? Oh, I guess you haven't heard. What? Wells died. Oh. By the way, I ought to mention one more thing. I found a track out there. It was pretty well snow blown. I-- it looked human. 8 inches wide, 20 inches long. Garrett, you trying to push that superstition on me, too? Come on, you're a college boy. You better face facts, Sheriff. You got two dead men out there, 250 people in a ski resort, and if you don't do something pretty quick, you're going to have a panicked town on your hands. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm doing everything I know how, you know what I mean? Now look here, Mr. Olsen! There wasn't a damn thing we could do about that. That thing was yay tall! And you let this son of a bitch out in the woods! I should have known better! I should have run out there myself! Don't slam that door like that, you drunk! Now where did this fiasco take place? Come on, show me! Come on! Up here in this-- this section here. Right near that windfall. This still gives me the creeps, Mr. Olsen. That thing looked at me, looked right in my eyes, and headed right at me. Yeah, he looked at me, too. He wanted to kill, didn't he? He sure as hell did. And he looked at you. Uh-huh. Get yourself a new machine and pack some equipment. We leave first thing in the morning. Yes sir, Mr. Olsen. Move out. Yes sir. Think I know how to get it now. I hope he recognizes you. Tim. Yeah, I want, uh, a flare gun, two skidders, uh, some explosives, and one of those big steel mesh cargo nets we use for shipment. Yeah, for tomorrow morning. Uh, come over here now, and I'll-- I'll tell you what I want done with it. Right. Huh? Oh, yeah, it's-- it's for a big trap. Uh-huh. With live bait. Right. [LAUGHING] Been doing a lot of reading, Dave. From the material I've been pulling for you, I think I know what you're after. I'm not even sure I know what I'm after, or if I'm even going to be able to find it here. Mr. Carlson, do you believe in the legend of Arak? Well, I printed all that material over the years. Course, that's my business. What I believe is unimportant. It's all what you want to believe, anyhow. There is one person, though-- old Daniels. Daniels? I don't know if he's still around anymore, but he knew. He knew the story. I don't even know if he's alive. Even if you did find him, though, I don't know if you'd get anything out of him. Never talked much, you know, that old Indian, except to Old Jake. Trapper Jake? Yeah. He knows old Daniels. He'd know if he's still around. Daniels. I gotta to be going, Mr. Carlson. Thanks a lot for your help. I appreciate it. You see Trapper Jake. Whoa, boy, who turned your gas on? Sis, I gotta talk to you! What are you doing here? We've gotta get a hold of Dave! [PHONE RINGING] Sheriff Cooper. Karen here. Is Dave there, by chance? I've tried his office. No. Left here quite a while ago. Why? What's up? Well, I know you're going to find this hard to believe, but-- Try me. It's about Harvey Olsen, and-- Come on, come on, come on! [KNOCKING] Well, what brings you here, Sheriff? Nothing good on the TV? Have a drink. Oh, not when I'm on duty. You know that, Olsen. Somebody mad at you? Who's throwing snowballs? Cut the bullshit, Cooper. Don't play around with me. What do you want? All right, now, look, Harvey. I'm not accusing you of anything, but through the grapevine, I hear some of your men been doing some shooting in the woods. [LAUGHING] I must say, you certainly do have an interesting communication system, Sheriff. Grapevine? Well, let's just say a little birdy told me that you're putting up a lot of money for something that don't exist. Now, Harvey, that's your business. But when two people get killed, it's my business. What do you mean, two people got killed? Hank died. Harold was brought in, massacred the same way. Don't you try to involve me in that. Then when did you become so damn concerned about old Hank Wells that you're hanging around his deathbed? Information, Cooper. Just information. Yeah. Coop. Stop being such a horse's ass. I'm a businessman. And I can feel it. That thing out there does exist. It does exist, and it could change everything for us! It could put this town on the map, and it could make a big man out of you, too. Good Lord. Don't tell me that you, Harvey Olsen, really believe that there's a monster out there. Let's just say that I am going to get whatever is causing those problems. Now that would help you, wouldn't it, sheriff? I just don't want nobody taking the law in their own hands, and that includes you, Harvey. I'll remember that at election time, Sheriff Cooper. You just do that. Meanwhile, I don't want any interference from you or your men. He is mine! You sure, Jimmy? Honest, Dave. Honest. He may be a brat sometimes, but he's never lied to me before. Why now? Why now what? Well, the last recorded violence in connection with this creature, Bigfoot, has been some 30, 35 years ago. And I found no proof that he had anything to do with the death of those seven men. He's been seen hundreds of times since then, and no one's even been hurt. But you're forgetting the baby, Dave. It was protecting the baby. Its baby. I think you're right. I think that-- I think that Wells and Harrow probably captured the little one. And Wilson's men killed him. You know, Jimmy, we don't have proof of that. Now, the first thing we've got to do is we've got to get Olsen to stop hunting it down. NEWSCASTER (ON RADIO): That's good advice from those folks. The time right now is 8:45 in the PM. News and sports coming up at the top of the hour. Right now, marking the mercury outside at 15 degrees below, and the weather man says maybe 30 below tonight, and even colder way up north. This is North Country Radio, WNCR, and I'm Doug-- [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, you think maybe if I practice, maybe I could look like that? Some got it, some don't. Let's go outside. [INAUDIBLE] Don't be silly. Of course I am. You wanna make it a night to remember? Maybe. You really think he's going to show up, huh, Jake? All I can tell you is he said he would. I knowed him for 25 years now, and he ain't never lied to me yet. Oh, uh, say, uh, you want a slug of this? No. [INAUDIBLE]. Well, about damn time you got here, Daniels. This here is Mr. Garrett, the forest ranger I was telling you about. This is Ed Daniels, just like I said. I don't speak Indian very well. Don't you worry none about it. He understands every word you say. He just don't like to talk much. Sure does listen good, though. That's how come I like him. I'm gonna go out and feed my dogs while you two's talking. Ed, you can trust him. I swear, you got my word on it. Thanks, Jake. Now, won't you sit down? I've read a lot about the legend of Arak. I find it a bit sketchy. I need more facts. Jake seems to think that you can help me. Will you? I'm scared, Kevin. We shouldn't have stayed behind. Even though it was worth it. Don't be scared. Still, it's sort of spooky. You just make sure you stay next to me, OK? Oh, baby, you know I will. Seems like this trail goes on forever. Yeah, but it's not much further. Getting cold, too. Yeah, wait until I get you home. I'll warm you up. You and your shortcuts. Yeah, well. Come on, let's go. [ROARING] [SCREAMING] [ROARING] I know what I'm going to do. I'm going to kill the damn thing. I'm going to kill it before Olsen even gets next to it. You better remember what that thing looks like Yeah, I remember what it looks like. But I don't give a damn. Because don't nobody talk to us like that. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna kill it and bury it and we're gonna let Olsen wonder about what happened to it for the rest of his life. You had too much to drink. Maybe. You better sober up good before morning. Because I tell you what we aim to do. We aim to get it, collect our money, and then have some fun. Yeah, that's pretty good. We just get on down the road. But I still ain't gonna let him get away with talking to us like that. [LAUGHING] Let me get over there. Come on. -Huh? -Come on. We're gonna get out of here. Is he dead or alive? Just suffering from shock and exposure. Come on, get out of the way. How did it happen? I don't know. Does that make a believer out of you, Sheriff? This thing's got to be killed. Why? Because it scares people? [CHAINSAW] Hi, Harry. Abominable snowman keeping you busy? Glad you know all about it. Hey, Harry. What? What happened to all the tranquilizing supplies? Bobby Olsen came in yesterday with a requisition from Doc Scholls. Guess that's all there was. Hey, what's the big deal? Where is that animal, warden? This white garbage comes down any harder, we ain't going nowhere. Hey! Hike! Hike! Whoa, there! Whoa! Whoa, boys! Whoa, baby! Whoa! Whoa there! Stay. Them's good dogs. Hey, Willie. Hi, Leonard. And just where do you think you're going with these mangy dogs of yours? Same place you're going, I guess, Sheriff. Dave Garrett, he told me to meet him right here, and he said for me to bring my dogs. You say hello to Garrett for me, because we're going ahead. Come on, let's get going. And one thing else. You can tell him we're gonna shoot to kill whatever this thing is out there. Besides, if we don't, Olsen will. Am I glad you're here. Well, what on earth is going on? I've never seen anything like this before. News travels fast. I guess everybody wants to know what's going to happen next. Here, table five. Curiosity seekers. It's already started. Wow, where does it go? Come on, I'll show you! You're nuts! I'm not going in there! It's only about 100 yards. I was in there all by myself! It ain't safe! Aw, come on. Come on. Wow. What's it for? It's for the creature. Mr. Olsen must really think he's gonna get it. Do you really think he's gonna get it? I hope not. Hey, look at this! What was that? Now we've had it. Keep quiet. Listen. It's going away. You always get me in trouble. Who was that? I don't know, but let's get out of here! Whoa, whoa! Dangit, Mr. Garrett! All we seem to be doing is following the sheriff's tracks. We're halfway to Devil's Point and I ain't seen nothing. I'm not after the sheriff, Jake. I'm after Olsen. You think this might be a good spot to camp for the night? No, let's go on up around Devils Point. You mean where-- where we found John's body? Yeah. We'll look for tracks up there tonight, and if we don't find anything, we'll take off in the morning. All righty. Whatever you say. Hike, [INAUDIBLE]! Hike! You guys! You must have been on the sauce again! There's not even a trace of it! Nothing! Well, it done snowed in the meantime, Mr. Olsen! That ain't our fault! I can see that, you idiot! But not enough to cover up a body! Now where the hell is it? Look, it was right in there. I can swear it. On your mother's grave, I suppose. I know it was there. That's where we left it. I know. Hike! Hike! Hike! Hike! All right, whoever that is, we take care of him. Suppose it's Sheriff Cooper, Mr. Olsen! I don't give a damn who it is, because nobody, nobody, is going to deprive me of what is mine! Now take cover. Hike! Hike! What's gonna happen to him now, Mr. Olsen? I don't give a damn if they freeze to death! Move! [BARKING] Get them up here. Put them together. Lock their arms together. Lash them around the back, tight! OK, that's good. We'll camp tonight at Devil's Point. You're not going to leave them like this, are you, Mr. Olsen? That's right. We sure got into something here. Let's go. Boy, that Olsen, he must be crazy. Don't know how he think he gonna get that big critter to come down under here. I don't know, but if he really believes this is gonna work, I don't ever want to hear him call us dumb no more. I won't call you dumb. No, you're beyond that. Tie them up! Wait a minute, now. Do you know what that thing would do to us if it saw us? Yes I do! I'm counting on it! You two are perfect bait. Come on, move! Bait! Keep an eye on them. If they move, shoot them. Now, listen to me. I want to get all this done right now. I don't want any mistakes! Yes sir. Let's move! [ROARING] [EXPLOSIONS] [ROARING] God. It's magnificent. [GROWLING] Who are you? Huh? Where did you come from? I waited for you for 25 years! That's your superstition! 25 years, and it's all mine! [LAUGHING] I'll be doggoned. You ever see anything like that before? He's gone crazy. Sure has. Well, you've served your purpose. OK. Go on. Get out of here. Go on! All right, let's move him out of here. Tell you, Mr. Garrett, I don't think this weather is going to let us last much longer. I can't get these damn ropes off with these gloves. Where is Dave? Why don't we go see Sheriff Cooper? All right. Ironic, ain't it? 25 years, I've been telling that story to everybody. Never could get anybody to believe me. Yeah, except Olsen. Except Olsen. [CRUNCHING] Hey, listen. What's that? I don't know. Damn you, Daniels. I swear it'd be more fitting for an Indian to shoot a feller in the belly than it is to sneak up and scare him to death. Sure am glad to see you, Daniels. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] He says you've got to set the critter free. Where is he? [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Caged at Olsen's mine. We'll get the sheriff. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] No, he says Arak must be set free. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] I'll be damned. Daniels here is the last of Arak's tribe. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] You're supposed to wear that thing, and the critter will understand you. You're supposed to tell him that Daniels is waiting for him. Let's get out of here. Look, you go get the sheriff and some men. I'll see you at the mine, OK? It was on the TV last night, Karen. This guy comes out, you know, the one with the raincoat? Beautiful. He says, I hate to bother you-- Sheriff, this is important. All right, Karen. Look, I don't know where he is. I told you, he never showed up. Look, Garrett's a big boy. He can take care of himself. There's no way I'm going out in those woods again tonight. Besides, I didn't find anything or anyone. OK. Then what are you going to do about that cage that Jimmy found? Well, what do you want me to do about it? It isn't illegal. Besides, that's a killer animal. It's better off right where it is. Then I'll do something about it. Karen. Come on, Jimmy. Let's get out of here. [SCREAM] Timberline. Come in, Garret! Garrett, damn it! [STATIC] [INTERPOSING VOICES] Hey, Mr. Olsen, you get that thing yet? You're damn right I did. Well, when are we gonna get to see it, then? When you do see it, you'll pay for it. [LAUGHING] Come on! Have a drink on me! [CHEERING] God. The legend is real. And it's gonna put this town on the map! It's gonna make this the biggest thing-- damn fool! Now listen to me! Listen, everybody! I need some help! Now, for the first time in all our lives, we've got it made. And somebody's trying to take it away from us. You know what I mean! So anyone who's got a shotgun or a pistol or whatever gets $100 bucks from me! Now follow me! Come on! OK, come on! Let's go! Come on, let's get our guns! [SIRENS] Come on! Everybody get your guns [INAUDIBLE]! Go get your guns! OK, what's this? All right, cool it, Harvey. You're not going anywhere. Stop those guys. All right, get out of the way, Cooper! That thing is mine! He's mine! Harvey, I'm placing you under arrest. Give me that gun. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Get back inside, you [INAUDIBLE]. [EXPLOSION] [GROWLING] There it is. Wait. Who's that? That's Mr. Olsen. What do we do now? I know. Come on. I'll show you. [GROWLING] [GROWLING] [ROARING] [GUNFIRE] Garrett! Garrett! He's mine, Garrett! [GROWLING] [SCREAMING] [GUNSHOT] [ROARING] Jimmy, run! [SCREAMING] Jimmy! [EXPLOSION] [GROWLING] [ROARING] [COUGHING] [EXPLOSION] [COUGHING] Dave! [CRYING] Jimmy! It didn't hurt me.
