[ Music ] [ Music ] [ Music ] [ Music ] Billingsley's my name and hustlin's my game. You know there are three things that get most people excited. Sex, politics... And money. You know, I've been hustling on this banana republic for the last 10 years. And believe me, if there's a fast buck to be made. Old bill knows where it's at, don't he, baby? Like the time that there was a certain one million dollars in u.S. Currency right on this island. General balthazar, the self-proclaimed leader of the last regime, he was trying to get the money off the island with the help of a very ambition captain morales. Then there was malavael, leader of the bloodiest band of cutthroats that ever lived. Man, they would shoot their own mother for a million dollars. Now you wouldn't think to look at this young couple, but the same million bucks was doggin' their trail. Jo Turner, an American girl, and Ernesto Gutierrez, a gorilla leader, her bag was love, his the revolution. Now, her mission for him was to find some help and blow this bridge, which was Ernesto's signal to grab a million bucks, enough loot to hire every bandito in the country. Rocco was an informer, who worked for the bandit malavael, and his job was to make sure that the women would not show up at the bridge. [ Music ] The truck is here. Outta the truck. Where's the regular driver? Sick. I expected you at sunrise. Sixteen foot speakers. Take 'em or leave 'em. One thousand pesos. Keep it moving. Keep it moving. Move it, ladies. The fruit is waiting. Quickly, your lead. Jo Turner: Did you get it? Of course. [ Music ] Four miles from here, a minute ago, they hit a government convoy at 10:00 am. If all goes right, it'll be over by 10:05. Your men don't move 'til we hear the bridge blow. If it blows. And I think girls are only good for blowing one thing, man. And it ain't no stinkin' Bridges, either. That bridge is the signal. You wait for it. You lawyers blow your signal out your stinkin' ass. You stupid, fidels. Man, you don't know your asshole from your ear hole. You're way behind your debt. Listen, scum bag, this is our plan. Our information and our cause. We are in it together, huh? Unless there's been some kind of a change in plan? Uh, is he mad? Eh, he's not mad, he's happy. Just wait for the signal. Yeah, the signal. Vamonos. [ Music ] [ Whistling ] [ Laughing ] We shouldn't be without guard, page Ernesto. We need fire power. That convoy's carrying one million dollars in cash and without malavael and his men, we couldn't touch one fuckin' santavo. Do you really think we can cross them to settle for a third? If it was up to me, I'd kill them all right after the rate. We're not bandits, Raul. Maybe we'll be sorry we're not. [ Music ] The convoy will be looking for an ambush. Mei ling: That, ladies, is where we come in. Just before the attack, we separate. That's the part of the convoy. And how's it done? By blowing the bridge... With this. We blow the bridge and then we split. Remember, no one's programmed to be a hero today. So take no chances. Got it? Yeah. Make sure you do because it's a million bucks in cash riding on it. Johnny! [ Gunshots firing ] Ow! [ Gunshots firing ] That's enough! Juan morales: Ruiz. Ruiz: Sir? Are there any men in the building besides that warehouse man? No, sir. Well, you take care of everything. You may lower your hands. Allow me to introduce myself. Captain Juan morales, at your service. Considering the circumstances, I can understand your lack of concern for the social amenities, but that's easily forgiven. Or with you, most beautiful ladies, no introductions are necessary. I know all about you, as you may have already guessed. Jo Turner, daughter of admiral Lawrence crawdad Turner, u.s. Navy, retired. Now, the woman of our next diablais. But will she never leave there. From your capitol social register, to my country's list of subverses, this accomplishment, all in six months. Such is the power of love. Mei ling, hopefully the last in a long line of political fanatics. Your late family was well respected by my superiors, and myself. Where are your men? No comment, pork chop. So, you are the representatives of the people, their liberators, and we are the oppressors, the pork chops. How do you think we found you here? An accident? Nah. An anonymous phone call from one of the people. Save yourself some pain, my beautiful little saboteurs. Tell me where to find your men. You're pissin' in the wind, little man. Get them outside. I will ask you again, where are your men? [ Giving orders in Spanish ] [ Giving orders in Spanish ] Need I ask again? You can stick it up your ass. Both of them. I will give the command. [ Giving orders in Spanish ] There's more than one way to skin a pussy. Load these two in the Jeep. Come on-- move it. All right-- all right. I'm going. Inside. Stop shoving me. Who could've tipped that bastard? Nobody know we were gonna use that warehouse. Our men knew and malavael. It just doesn't make sense. We get popped and there's no signal. No signal, no attack, no money. I just can't buy that it could be one of them. We both knew. And we're still alive. It could be one of US. It's possible. So, when they kill you and don't kill me, then you'll know I'm the rat. Meanwhile, I'd like to know what really happened and where Ernesto is right now. On the run, or a prisoner like US, or dead. Shut up. Now listen, pretty comrade, listen very well. The revolution needs Ernesto. It needs you and me and everyone who believes in it. But it will go on no matter what happens to him or to US. Now you listen, I am in this for only one reason, because he is. If anything happens to him, you can squat on your revolution. [ Music ] Please, gentlemen, relax. We have support behind and ahead. Entire route is being combed for ambushes. Glory is upon US. [ Music ] [ Music ] [ Explosion ] The bridge! [ Crashing ] Fire! [ Guns firing ] The money! The money! We're taking the money! [ Gunshots firing ] [ Gunshots firing ] [ Gunshots firing ] [ Gunshots firing ] Pepe, they still don't want to give it up. Disconnect their stinkin' hands. Go ahead-- open it. [ Laughing ] [ Cheering ] Well, I guess this is where we make the split. Yup. I guess this is where we blow your stinkin' heads off. [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Shouting ] Nincompoops! We travel in style now. Inside this case is one million u.S. Currency. No more groveling for thieves. Besides, we have a schedule to keep. Get these stinkin' bodies out of here! May I have a light? Yes! Never take your wounded with you. They only slow you down. I got matches. We better move it, pepe. The troops are right behind US. What about the bitches? Vamonos! Now you're gonna sing for me, loud and clear. Ah, I-I swear to you, on the grave of my mother. My-my grandfather. I touched no one. I'm innocent. Sergeant Jackson: Cut the jive. But I speak the truth. I swear I do. No, no, please! You raped six girls. Six helpless girls! Not one over 15-years-old. You're gonna pay for that. You are gonna pay for that. Mercy, mercy. Look, I tell you the truth. I like men. Have it your way. I like your way better anyway. Sergeant Jackson, major Ortega wants to see you in her office right away. All right. Now, you're gonna sign this confession, or you will never get another chance to use the little dick you've got. I wanna see a lawyer. Please. A lawyer, you're not gonna need. No. No. No, no! No, no! [ Screaming ] Major Ortega: Hope I didn't interrupt anything touchy. Things are a little tense, but I think it came off all right. Sergeant Jackson, special sections. This is captain Juan morales, six arraignment combat unit. Pleasure to make your acquaintance, sergeant. At ease. Major Ortega tells me you're most effective at interrogation. I do what I can. I have just brought in a pair of subjects for you, two every important young women, both hard core insurrectionists. What we want to know is this, where are their male counterparts? And we want this information immediately. I'm in criminal investigation, captain. My subjects are always and have always been men. Men of the service. This is rather a special case, sergeant. An insurrection, just in case you haven't heard, is also a crime. I'll see if they've got anything to say, captain. Ruiz, major Ortega and I would like a conference in private. So if you'll excuse US. Of course, captain. Hasta luego. Hasta luego. When she gets them to talk-- We haven't got much time. Jackson's good. When those women talk, I have my promotion. Major morales, perhaps colonel morales. And you think you're worthy of such an important position, you silly little coward. Please, don't talk to me like that. Why not? You are a coward, and you like to be treated like a dog. Please, don't-- please. Isn't it true? Aren't you a dog? No. Yes. Yes, you are. No, I'm a man! You're a dog. A sniveling, whipped dog. Stop it-- stop it! Aren't you? No! Aren't you? Tell me you're a dog. I'm a dog. What kind? [ Whimpering ] A whipped dog. Then lick me. [ Music ] [ Music ] Cut it. That's what you get when you mess with the wrong ass, corporal-- you get burned. But searg-- shut the mouth-- out. Would you be so kind, ladies, step inside. Well, Mei ling, you finally got your yellow tail busted. That's right, little girl, me and your girl scout friend know each other pretty well. Real well, in fact. We used to be what you might call, co-workers. We were whores in the same house. So now she dropped down to being a pig. Yeah, I've been a lot of things. And now I'm a heavy duty pig. But you two, standing here in jail, about to get your asses kicked, or probably shot off in the morning. So what does that make you, huh? A little easier in the mind, probably. Sweet baby, you're so wrong. Mei ling, you remember saying something about me once? You said I had a twisted kind of integrity. I hated having to sell my ass, but it didn't keep me from being the best whore in the house. Well, now I'm a cop and I haven't changed one bit. We're so proud of you. I knew you were gonna take that attitude. I've got one more thing to say. One way or another, you're gonna talk, so why don't you do it with the least hassle and the least pain? Our people know we've been captured. They will have moved, so there is nothing to tell you. That makes sense, but it makes no difference. They didn't put me here to use my judgment. I am here to make you say what they wanna hear. And that's what's gonna happen. Now, I suppose I can put you through the usual interrogation routine. Warm up with a quick little beating, then straighten you out with a heavy jolt of electricity, then maybe tear your fingernails out-- you know, the basic run of the mill shit. But, with you two, I think that would be a waste of time. It's all gonna be wasted, bitch. That's dumb, but I'll have to take your word for it. So, you'll skip part one and move to part two. And even I don't get a charge out of that. Oh, shit. Now she's gonna kill US with tenderness. Yeah. Her first. On the table. Sit down. Pigs, leave me alone. Don't move. Don't do it. Tell her-- I've got nothing to say about it. Have yourselves a ball. Steady. Don't be a dead chump. Go fuck yourself. After you, baby. [ Alarm sounding ] Stay here and do nothing 'til I get back. What the hell is that? A general alert, you clumsy shit. An escape? How the hell should I know? General balthazar! Oh, damn. Once an irritating political problem. Now, like so many dead flies. The revolution has been, how do you say-- snuffed. Indeed, captain. A victory for our army. Selflessness of men and victory for our p.R. P.r., sir? Public relations, captain. Press relations. Captain, you've taken the last of the rebel leaders, alive. Think of the press coverage. Two beautiful subverses. No doubt. The fire against the backdrop of these corpses. A sunrise execution. Sensational. Our names will travel the globe. Matron Ortega. General. Schedule an immediate press conference. I want to present the captives to the media of the war. Yes, sir. Morales, follow me. I want a word with you. Jackson. Once in everyone's life, there comes a golden opportunity-- and yours, may be close at hand. Sir? The revolution is dead. Which is wonderful. But, and here is something I do not want to give to the press. Trust me, general, trust me. Malavael and his bandits, we have a corpse to prove it. They attacked and escaped-- which is terrible. Escaped, captain! With one million dollars United States currency belonging to our government. We just got the straw fake. Morales, this is your chance. Find malavael and the money. Do this and I can promise that you will no longer be captain morales, major or even colonel. My general, but I am most undeserving. That's neither here nor there. I am a general. I wear ten stars. I promise you, if you're successful, you can have a star of your own. A star? A star. You'll have malavael and the money. Godspeed, general. General, you suppose it would be possible for me to have, uh, a photograph taken with you? Well, why not? Ruiz, quickly! Sorry, sir. [ Music ] Must've been a rough game. Yeah, we are just waitin-- [ reporters shouting ] Let them through. All credit must go through the offices of men of our army with the street foreplay and beat 'em bust. Did you say foreplay, general? Uh, we can trust. Oh, shit. [ Reporters shouting ] [ Crying ] Leave her alone. Help-- help me! Jo, stop it. Stop it, Jo! Oh! Leave her alone. She doesn't know what she's doing! Cut that shit out. Jo? Jo? [ Speaking Spanish ] Jo, are you listening? Yeah. Malavael has set US up. He must have gotten away. And I'm the one that talked Ernesto into using him. There is no use thinking about that. I was for it, myself. And now, Ernesto's dead. But that's all behind US now. We've got to think of a way to get out of here. We're running out of time. I know. Jo, are you still with US? No. That's over for me now. I'm gonna kill malavael if it's the last thing I do. [ Music ] Oh! Shh. [ Moaning ] [ Music ] Right on time-- right on. Well, ol' buddy, I promised you an aviator and I got you one. Yes, sir, one of the very best. Old Jake here, he flew 50 missions over the hump in ww2. Is that not a fact, my man? Hubba, hubba. Fuck the hope! Can that Turkey fly? Like an eagle, baby. Like a bald ass screamin' eagle-- shut up! Mr. Billingsley told you my fee? Five thousand. And a thousand for me and my staff. I know the price. Small tortillas, pepe. Green back salad, my favorite dish. Watch out! [ Guns firing ] [ Music ] [ Indistinct ] [ Guns firing ] It's an aviator, huh? [ Gun firing ] You! You double crossing coward. Hey, now put that thing away now. You're thinking crazy thoughts. Now, look. I can dig how you could be, but you shouldn't-- no sir. Now, I almost got myself killed. Look, look, my man punjab, he almost had his bell rung. Hey malavael, we're friends, we've been doing business together for years. Now, why would I wanna try to rip you off? One million u.S.! I didn't know that's what you were taking off the island. You told me to get you a pilot and a plane-- that's what I did. How did he know? Jesus Christ, malavael, I don't know-- I swear it. Hey, hey look, keep my fee. Keep the thousand, I'll get you a boat. I'll get you off here today for nothing. No! I'm going to get my own stinkin' boat. Take this! Vamonos, muchachos! Gah! Bye-bye. Ya'll take care now, ya here! Ya'll come back! Nobody but nobody treats winslow Pete billingsley like that, especially that taco vendor. Well, am I right or wrong? [ Moaning ] Listen, the last thing I need right now is a lot of shit out of you. Now, that refried asshole is in the possession of one million dollars cash money, and I aim to get my share, which by my count, is all of it. Now, come on. [ Music ] Billingsley. I called first, but your line was out of order. Your mouth is out of order, boy. Hey, I could get it chopped off for sneaking in here. If you recall matron Ortega and yours truly are no longer on speaking terms. That's what you get for practicing unnatural acts. Mama, anything that's possible is natural. What's on your twisted mind? You didn't come here for that. Not entirely. Baby, I sure had a rotten day today. You know, I could express myself a whole lot better if I had some of the hot water to kinda soothe my aching muscles, you know. Yeah. It's all yours. Hands off, mother, or your ass is ham and I'm the slicer. Well, at least let me touch some of that smoke. Well? Simple. I'm gonna make you rich, old lady. With capitol ducks. Talk straight or don't talk at all. Jo Turner and Mei ling, they can lead US to one million dollars cash money. You want me to keep talking? Proceed. Those dead revolutionary yo-yo's, that ain't the whole story. They hit the convoy with malavael, then malavael hit them. You can guess what happened next. Malavael up and lifted the cash. Morales did split in a hurry. He's the competition, sweet cakes. Malavael never made it off the island. Now, according to my sources, he's waiting around for a boat with enough power to get him outta the channel. You want me to bust the prisoners out? US. Who else we gonna get to help US get the million dollars gone? The police? The armed forces, maybe? Come on, baby. We dropped outta the same kinda mold. Just different color plaster, that's all. Now, you ain't about to let that money get away. Those chicks will be shot in the morning. We move tonight. Tonight? You've got me straight, baby. In more ways than one. Good evening, matron Ortega. General balthazar, what a surprise! No word from morales yet. Oh, what a shame. And the prisoners? Might be kinky, but then three-on-one might be too much to handle, even for you, general. Why, general. I'm shocked! Are you surprised? Of course. Then you are shocked, huh? Yes. Ha, I'll bet you are. Open up. Hello, sergeant. What brings you by so late? None of your fucking business. Twenty one gun salute, general. But, of course, Ortega. Now, I wish to see those prisoners. Yes, sir. I'll have them sent over. No, no, we go there. In the cell? Not too early. I'm also a master of camouflage. Can I see your orders? Get the hell off that fat ass and open up this goddamn door. Now! Open up. You two, out. You, in. You got it, sisters, this is a bust out. Put 'em on. Just fake it 'til we get past the guards. Well, come on. I don't have time to patch things up. So, if you have any doubts, now is your chance? What happened to that twisted sense of integrity? Nothing-- I just resigned. Excuse me, matron, a question about the duty roster. This won't take a minute, general. Jackson, what is this? Out processing. Arrest them! You men, over here. [ Guns firing ] [ Sirens blaring ] [ Guns firing ] [ Guns firing ] [ Explosion ] You and Jackson call for a cab? You're right on time. [ Guns firing ] [ Guns firing ] [ Music ] A quarter of a million a piece. That's the deal I signed up for. A nice little nested egg for a retired service woman. But very small potatoes for our revolution. My, my, my I'm gonna worry myself to death over that. Make it a half million, Mei ling. Malavael is all I want out of this. You're giving her your share? Going home to my people with a quarter million dollars in cash would only make the IRS happy. I don't know what to say, Jo. Save it. As long as we're marching shoulder to shoulder with god's gift to panting womankind over there, we're all jerking ourselves off anyway. Billingsley? Mmm-hmm, that Dixie hustle would sell you out once for every buck and you know it. Come on, look. You seem to be forgetting, he laid his ass out on the line to bust you out. Mm-hmm, with good reason. Last night, he told US that, uh, malavael was trying to get off the island on a plane that got fucked up and is now looking for a boat. Now, how would he know that if he wasn't right in there with him? Read the writing on the wall? He's playing all the instruments in the band. You're right, we can't trust him. When we get the money, the four way split he talks about will be a one way split. And all in his favor. Look, you know how I feel about money, the more I got, the more I wanna spend on me. Only, I don't like the idea of screwing a fellow hustler. All right. Let's give him a little test, and if he loses, at least he can say he got the best screwing of his cheating life. Twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine-- hi. Good mornin'. I'll be with you in a minute. Just as soon as I finish my workout. Eighty-one, eighty-two-- little tired this morning. Last night kinda took it outta me. Eighty-three. I could never tell. Eighty-four. Well, I try to stay in shape. You know, healthy mind, healthy body. Just love a well-toned body. You do? Yes. The muscles get so hard. Uh, excuse me. Honey, that muscle developed naturally. All by itself. Billingsley, you saved my life last night, and I couldn't think of a better way to show my appreciation. It's the thought that counts. What's the matter, baby? You wouldn't tell the others, would you? I mean, I wouldn't want them to think I was trying anything devious. Not a word. Promise? Now, baby, you remember what I said, don't you? What you said, what you did, I only hope you meant it. Every sentence, honey. It's just the three of US: You, me, and the money. Nobody else. Seven, eight, nine, ten-- hmm, your body's beautiful, but the bread's even prettier. Let's get going. As soon as I finish my constitution. Eighteen. As soon as I knock off 150, we'll be ready to roll. Twenty. It's been a long time. I've almost forgot how good it feels. Take your time, baby, refresh your memory. All those chicks are out cookin' breakfast, I kinda thought it might be a good idea to tell you how much balls you showed last night. Ah, excuse me a minute. We showed those two-bit army peckerwoods how a real down home bust out was tossed, didn't we, babe? Billingsley, come here. Mmm, billingsley. Baby, exercise is good, but I always did prefer team sports. Now, baby, you remember what I said, don't you? What's that coming and always you're going, ya dig? Hey, baby. You blew my mind, but I didn't lose my head. I meant every word I said. It's just the three of US: You, me, and the money. Nobody else. And twenty-one. Two, three, four, five-- I'll be ready to go in another 25-- just a flash. I'm in no hurry. We better get on the case or malavael-- it's still very early. And I thought that since we will be working together, we should get to know one another. Oh, you do? Excuse me. Now, you remember what I said, don't you, baby? Of course. You're with me? Forever, I wish. Then you've got it. It's just the three of US: You, me, and the money. Nobody else. Ye-ha! What a night, huh? Just like the fourth of July all over again. Man, what a show. Hot, huh-- pretty hot, huh? No doubt about it. Now, all we gotta do is bop on down to the waterfront, grab malavael, unburden him of the money, and we're home free. That's right, billingsley. That's all we have to do. Hey, come on. Quit puttin' me on. I know wouldn't-- fuck me over like this. We're grateful for you for giving US a hand, last night. And for what you did this morning, it wasn't so bad either. That's why we're not gonna burn your shifty ass. [ Moaning ] No, it's-it's just a joke. A little prank. Don't let the rock fall down, or your hat will blow away. You know, billingsley, you look kinda sexy all tied up like that. Yeah? Well, I used to think I'd let all of you pee in my face just to see where it came from, but hell, not anymore. So long, friend. It's been real. Hey, come on, they'll bust my ass out here. You can't leave US like this. We're helpless. You, helpless? No way. After I got you away clean! You got no fucking gratitude! Punjab, my man, can you believe this shit? [ Grumbling ] Bitches. [ Music ] So, you speak the truth. Malavael seeks a boat. You see, I would not lie to you, cap-i-tan. Of course, not. That's why our government rewards cooperation from its citizenry. Thank you, cap-i-tan, thank you. Ruiz. Sir? The reward. Certainly. Congratulations. Thank you, thank you. Captain, with this information-- I will be general, and you, ruiz, will be general z and a captain. You mean-- I will have my star. And you will have your bars. Oh, cap-i-tan! Hey, Vic, I've been lookin' all over for you, man. I need pegleg's boat. It's not available. There's some money in it for you. Now, how soon can you set it up? No boat. There is no boat. Jesus Christ, Vic. Come on, man. I never let you down. I gotta have that boat. All right, you want the boat? You have to talk to pegleg, himself. All right, I'll talk to pegleg. So, who's got it? A guy with patch over his eye made a deal with pegleg. Malavael? Yeah. Shit-- wait a minute. Wh--what time did they leave here? Three o'clock. You're wasting your time. Yeah, you're right, man. I'll get my own boat. Captain morales, please. Morales? Billingsley. Ju-just hold on a minute. Look, how'd you like to get your hands on that million bucks? Yeah, I thought so. No, today. Well, sure I know where it is. Just wa-- look, wait a minute. I get twenty-five percent, right? All right, we got a deal. Yeah, all right, meet me at the pier at three o'clock. You got it. [ Music ] [ Music ] I don't believe this. Quit bitchin'. You want to find malavael, don't you? This is ridiculous, I mean, look at US. This is absolutely ridiculous. I don't understand-- will you cut it out? This is absolutely the most-- shut yo' mouth! [ Music ] If we don't see him in here we've gotta get to the back room. [ Music ] Jackson, baby! Fuckin' a, it's been a year and a day! Where have you been keeping that tight body of yours, huh? Somewhere too far that's been keeping me from you, honey. Friends of yours? Just associates. Mei ling, Jo, meet Victor. He's a bouncer in this establishment. Say, you ain't seen malavael around here, have you? Why do you ask? Son-of-a-bitch gave me a dose, and I'm here to collect for the doctor's bill. He is a filthy one, ain't he? You seen him? I just came on duty, honey. He might be out in back. Or, maybe you wanna come out in back with me, huh? Still outta commission. What about my partners here? They're new into training. Tight as a mitt. You want 'em, boys? Okay, go on and take 'em out in back, and it's on me. This is an old friend of mine and if she can't walk, she's gonna dance for me, right? She's one of the best strippers in town. Whatever you say, baby. Come on. [ Music ] Put another record on. [ Indistinct ] [ Applauding ] [ Cheering ] [ Music ] [ Music ] Take it off! [ Music ] [ Music ] Now what? We check the rooms. [ Music ] Take it off! Well, shit. If you're gonna start without me, forget it. [ Music ] This is stupid, we're gonna get busted. [ Indistinct ] She was terrible. Yeah, you never saw his wife. [ Music ] Hey. Come on. [ Music ] Let's get the hell outta here! Arrest those women! [ Shouting ] That door over there! [ Shouting ] What's going on? [ Groaning ] Give me money! Give me money! Give money! Money. Money. No! I like to do that. Why won't you let me do that? Pepe? What? We got it, we got the boat. What? It's on the water. Let's go. Pepe! What? I want to cry. Out! No more of this bandito shit. From now on, it's my life in big cities. Come on, girls, line up for your presents. [ Screaming ] [ Gun firing ] Ha-ha, you needed only one bullet last time! Stinkin' bitches wouldn't stand still! This is it, pepe. Pegleg's streamer. Pegleg's streamer? Who the fuck is pegleg? We're sitting ducks out here. He's on his way. On his way? He's on his way! You going to start this stinkin' boat without him. Here he comes now. Where? I don't fucking believe it. You better fucking believe it if you want to get off this island. Let's see the color of your money. You got the keys to that stinkin' tub? You got the cabbage? Freaking army bastard! Holy shit, we've got company. [ Guns firing ] [ Guns firing ] Cover me! You bastards! [ Guns firing ] [ Explosion ] [ Guns firing ] If morales gets his hands on that money, we'll never touch it. True. Now? Let's wait for an opening. Cover the back! I said the back! The back of the building! Cover the back! The back! Now. Okay. [ Guns firing ] Hey, wasn't that billingsley? Half! Third! Half or nothing. You gotta stinkin' deal. Go ahead, let's go! [ Guns firing ] They're getting away! Quickly! [ Explosion ] Look out! Fuck 'em, this ain't no crosswalk! Cap-i-tan, I want promotions. We almost went all the way, ruiz. Camera, quickly, while we've still got light. [ Music ] [ Music ] Turn a left-- make a left. Dammit, dammit, dammit. That son of a bitch ruined my Panama, stole my money, and wasted my man, punjab. Now, I'm really pissed. Which way did they go, you jive time Turkey? Hey, for a quarter, I can tell you exactly where they went. To a boat with a full crew that'll take them to a plane and I know just where the plane is and I'm the dude that put it there. Hop in, stud. You've got a deal. No double cross. Parish the thought. So long, ol' timer, and thanks! [ Music ] Hold it, hold it, hold it. Back up right, turn here. But, this is the way to the beach. So is this, but this leads to the boat. Let's go. [ Music ] [ Music ] Very nice of that Kentucky fried shit for brains to provide such fine transportation, huh. But pepe, maybe this boat, it does not exist! Eh, this is your ticket to ride. Money talks, nobody walks. Come on! [ Music ] Yee-haa! Hey, boat, over here! [ Music ] Hey! Yee-ha-ha. Whoo! Drop 'em suckas! [ Gun firing ] Well, I do believe this! No, I was just telling my friend, one-eye, how we have to find you girls to give you your share of the money! Yes. Step away from that green, chump. Now, drop the rest of the hardware. Nice and easy. [ Indistinct ] Shh! Over here. Move it! Okay, far enough. This is the end of the road and I'm personally gonna put you over the edge. Start digging straight down. You see what they're doing to me? I chase these girls all over this island to give them their share of the money, and what do they do? They stick a stinkin' gun in my stinkin' back. Is there no trust left in the world? What am I going to do? Dig! Dig? Dig. Dig? [ Music ] You killed my man and my friends. Take your time and think about it before you die. You didn't have to go to all this trouble. No. I could make it up to you. This stinkin' bitch is going to do it. Yes. Well, I-I guess this is where we take the money and run. Yeah. I guess this is where we take the money and run. I believe I heard that one before. I could've told you that. All right, nobody moves, nobody gets hurt. But this money belongs to US. Don't take another step, dammit. I don't like to hurt women. Billingsley! Say, um, would that be a giant step do you suppose? Or a teeny step ol' bill here's got in mind? Don't push me now, I'll do ya. Billingsley, I got a deal for ya here, man! Ah! Billingsley! All right, come on, that's enough. Always check your clip before firing. Empty, huh? Story of the man's life. Always shootin' blanks. Hey! Billingsley! Thirty-two... Thirty-three, and thirty-three, and thirty-three. Why not? Okay by me. Just to show there's no hard feelings here's $10,000 for a new suit and a fresh start. Makes the division even. Three hundred and thirty thousand a piece. Six hundred and sixty thousand for you. What-- you're giving that kind of dough away? I got what I wanted. How about you? You gonna donate to the revolution? Nope-- I still gotta get what I want. Hey, we better split before that boat out there gives up on US. You know, I was just thinking about that money you gave me. Yeah, billingsley, I know you were thinking. Here's your car keys. [ Music ] Well, I guess you need a lift. It would help. Would you like for me to carry your gear? No, thank you. You know, you're gonna need some help getting that revolutions of yours back on track. Now, I've never been into politics myself, but I do know people. With all the money you've got, we could do a lot. A helluva lot. As a matter of fact, I've been thinking. I've got some great ideas. [ Indistinct ] Remember US at the beach house? I felt like you and I had a relationship then and we started to develop. It's just a matter of US getting together under the right premise. [ Music ] [ Music ]
