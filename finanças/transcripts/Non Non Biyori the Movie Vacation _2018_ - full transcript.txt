I'm off! No one's here yet. Ren-chan! Renge! 'Sup? Sorry we're late. Mom made Natsumi clean her room. Nyanpasu!

We'll play more together. Play how? With a ball or something? Let's play cicada... Cicada catching? Should we get some nets? ...and pretend we're shells. Oh. Maybe not. Let's play hide-and-seek, then! We're doing kid stuff again? Well, Ren-chon's still in first grade. You're a first-year too, Nattsun. We should do rock-paper-scissors! Count from three? Three, two, one... It's Candy Lady and Big Sis! Candy Lady! Big Sis! Hey, Ren-chon. Where are you riding the car to? Oh, just doing some shopping. Are you going to the department store? Take me with you! This isn't a field trip, guys. Me too! I wanna go too! We're not going there for anything special. It's so cool inside the car! Good thing I brought my wallet! I know, right? Great, now I'm a field trip chaperone. It really is a field trip. We've got our teacher and everything. All we need now is Bro, and we'll have the whole school here. There he is. We're at the department store! And here I was looking forward to some nice, leisurely shopping time. We knew this'd happen the moment they saw us. What are you two in the back gonna check out? Clothes. Oh, oh, I wanna ride the panda on the rooftop! We'll have time later. Let's meet here after we're done shopping, okay? Got it! What are you looking at, Hotaru? I can help choos— Oh, Senpai! I could certainly use some help deciding. What? O-Oh, right, okay! Is something wrong? You seem flustered. D-Do I? Y-You're looking at these? I don't think they're for elementary schoolers. Aren't they? Quite a few girls in my grade wore them at my last school. Really? Right. W-Well, I guess that's okay. S-So which ones were you looking at? The ones I wear now look a bit childish, so I was thinking about going black. Black?! N-No way! It's too early for that! Y-You think so? I thought it wouldn't look too bad. What are you talking about, Hotaru?! You're in elementary school! That's not okay! B-Black is more of a... mature lady's choice. A-And talking about bras is kind of embarrassing. I don't really know much about them. Bras? I wasn't looking at those. I was looking at the belts over here. All right! I got the console I wanted! Bro, we're throwing down as soon as we get back! Oh, Natsumi-senpai! Did you get what you needed? Bro and I pooled our New Year's money to buy a game console! Oh, the one that just came out? Nah, that one's too expensive. We went with an earlier model. What's with the blush, Sis? I'm not blushing. You're red as a beet. Okay, is everyone here? Yep! Let's get back, then. Oh, yeah. They gave me some raffle tickets. Did you get any? We did, but probably not enough for a draw. If we combine our receipts, we should be able to do a few. I wanna do a draw! Let's go do that before we leave, then. Nyanpasu-pasun! Do you have raffle tickets, young lady? I do! Then go ahead and do a draw! Good luck! I got this! Oh, blue gets a pack of tissues. There you go. I won tissues! Can I take this? Yeah, it's yours. Candy Lady! I won tissues! Yeah, good job. I did it! It must be 'cause I've been such a good girl. I helped out with cleaning the bath every single day! Oh, I see. Attagirl. Why don't you do one, Sis? We should have enough for one more. I never win at this kind of stuff. Congratulations! We have a winner! You've won our special prize! Well done! Here are tickets for a trip to Okinawa for four! I can't wait to go to Okinawa. Glad you can come with us, Konomi-chan. I want to ride the kayaks I keep hearing about. Yeah, me too! Oh, and I wanna stay at a place like this. It has that kinda Okinawan feel. You don't know where you're staying yet? We can choose, can't we? I'll ask Kazu-nee. What should I do? Natsumi, you'd better finish your homework before you leave. How much do you have left? Let's see... Just Japanese and English... Oh, and our math workbooks, summer project, book reports... Is there anything you have done?! You won a raffle, huh? I sure missed a lot on my way here from Tokyo. We're all going. Candy Lady too? Senpai says she'll pay for me if I help chaperone the kids. Konomi-chan's going too. Okinawa, huh? You don't want to go, Hika-nee? Can't say I'm particularly interested. I bet it's hella hot over there. But the ocean is so blue. There's plenty of blue in Tokyo too. I'd take it over Okinawa any day. Oh, yeah. I left some buns from Tokyo on the altar. Buns! I'm gonna go get them! I wanna go! I really, really wanna go! Please! I beg you! Take me too! Okinawa! Okinawa! You sure changed your tune fast. Why didn't you just say so from the start? I couldn't grovel on my knees with my little sister watching! This is the very last time I'll ever beg like this! Knowing that, can you really say no? I don't have the money. Ask your sister. I'm out of beer. Here you are, ma'am. Thanks. Please don't pour while groveling, though. Well, I figured you'd want to go, so I got tickets for you too. Aw yeah! Thank you! Thank you so much! All good. Thanks again! Well, if you've already gotten the tickets, I guess I don't mind going. I could hear every word you said from the altar. This'll be so much fun! I'll finally get to ride an airplane! The sea's very blue! You need to see this, Candy Lady! Oh, you're right. What was that? Cheese berry blue? She said the sea. Shoot, I can still barely hear. That flight did something weird to my ears. Hika-nee, your ears weren't made to fly, huh? Eel gourmet stir-fry? Is that what we're getting for dinner? Hika-nee! I can't what? Are we going straight to the hotel? Nah, we need to ride the ferry first. Though the ride'll only take ten minutes or so. Nacchan found a wonderful inn listed in the magazine. I can't wait to get there. Okinawa! We're in Okinawa! Well, it's been Okinawa the whole way here. It totally has that exotic feel! Nattsun, let's explore! Ren-chon, I like your initiative! All right! Let's go check out what lies past that corner! Yeah! Calm down, you two. Don't just run off. I get the excitement, but we should check in at the inn first. Okay. Is this place the sticks too? We're in Okinawa. We're here! I love the tiled roof! Let's get inside already. I'm melting. Excuse me. I have a reservation under Miyauchi. Coming! Oh, mensore! Please come in. Thanks. We'll step inside. It's so hot outside, isn't it? "Empore"? Oh, she said "mensore." That's Okinawan for "welcome." Really? I thought Okinawans said "mensore." I guess you can say "empore" too. It was "mensore," though... Huh? My ears still feel off. Aoi, the guests are here. Show them to their rooms. Got it! It must be hot out there. Thanks for coming! Let me show you to your rooms. They're in the back. Oh, you've got a young one working here. She's my daughter. Oh? How old is she? She's a first-year in middle school. First-year in middle school? That's the same as you. Would you like help carrying your luggage? Th-That won't be necessary, thank you. Okay, then. It's this way. Please watch your step. You're speaking awfully politely to someone your own age. Shut it. Your rooms are the Deigo Flower Room over here and the Ixora and Bougainvillea Rooms in the back. Dinner's served at seven, so please come to the dining room by the lobby then. Got it. Thank you. No problem! Please help yourselves to the tea and snacks in your rooms. We've also left fresh yukata and towels for you. If you need anything else during your stay, please let us know. She's really got it together. I can hardly believe she's Natsumi's age. How should we split up the rooms? We have one for four people, one for three, and one for two. Please allow us kids to share the four-person room with Hika-nee! Doesn't that leave you one bed short? Not a problem. Bro can have the two-person room to himself for making the winning draw. Hika-nee will bring over the extra futon and sleep on the floor. Hika-nee, you're okay sleeping on the floor, right? Huh? I can't really hear you, but sure, whatever. There you have it. Well, as long as Hikage's okay with it. Here's your key. See you in a bit, okay? Okay! Beds! Hey, don't jump on the bed. Man, I'm bushed. Can I just sleep 'til tomorrow? That'd be a waste of a day in Okinawa. Ren-chan, you brought your sketchbook! That's right. I'll show Okinawa to my countryside drawings. Like this. And when we get back, I'll show our countryside to the Okinawa drawings. That means you'll be drawing Okinawa too! Yes. I have three drawings I want to draw in Okinawa. Three? The sea, a lighthouse, and last but not least... Dolphins! Splash. I told you not to jump onto the beds! I think seeing the dolphins might be easier said than done. Really? We're coming in. Hello! It's freezing! Are you sure you didn't set the A/C too low? I don't get to set it low at home, so I'm trying it out. So what should we do tomorrow? We haven't decided what to do during the day, right? Let's see. We'll play at the beach during the day and get taco rice for lunch. Then we can go to the lighthouse in the evening. We can't afford to waste a single second. Let's get every bit of our money's worth out of this trip. That's the penny-pincher we know. I want to ride the kayaks! Oh, me too! I want to go snorkeling. I don't think we'll have time for both. We'll have to choose one. Hika-nee, you'd go with snorkeling, right? What? Okay, sure. Ren-chon, you're okay with it, right? I'm okay with it. I'd like to ride a kayak. Bro, do you wanna go sn— What? You'd rather go kayaking? We can split up into two groups for kayaking and snorkeling. Oh, that works. Should we give them a call? Are we all set? Can I hit the beach? Sure, you can. Go ahead. The beach! I wanna go to the beach too! Oh, me too! All right! Let's get into our swimsuits! I'll get changed too! Renge, give me my sunglasses back. Attack! There! You're not going to swim, Senpai? Food! Would you like to order any drinks? We'll get some beer for now. Two glasses, please. Coming right up. Honey, get some beer. There are lots of side dishes I've never seen before! This is great! What is it? That's jimami-dofu. It's tofu made from peanuts. Next to that is grilled kuruma shrimp. And next to that is rafute. It's stewed pork. They all look delicious! Aoi-san, do you usually help out with the cooking? I'm not involved with the cooking, but I clean rooms and do laundry once the guests are out for the day. Cool! What are you doing, Natsumi? I'll get a towel right away. Sorry about that. No problem. I really can't believe she's your age. I bet she has her homework together too. That was a great dinner! For sure! I'm so full! Natsumi, where are you going? I'm gonna look for a vending machine. Okay. We'll be in our room. Sure. Mom?! Y-You okay? You dropped your racket. Thanks. It just hit my forehead, so I should be okay. Wait, huh? What are you doing here? Oh, I thought I'd see if— Aoi? Oh, I thought I'd see if— Where've you gotten to? That thing! What thing? The racket! Hide it! Just hide it! Huh? Aoi? Oh, you're with a guest. Uh, yeah. Could you take care of the dishes while I do the ironing? Oh, sure. Knowing you, I thought you'd be playing badminton against the wall. O-Of course I'd never! Well, I'll leave it to you. Thanks! O-Okay. Sorry. That must've been kinda awkward. Oh, it's no big deal. Thanks for hiding the racket so quickly, though! My body just moved on instinct. Also, is that how you usually speak? I'm told to speak politely to the people staying here. I mean, to our valued guests. Don't worry about that stuff. We're the same age. Thanks! You like badminton? Yeah, I'm in the club at school. I gotta play against this wall if I wanna play at home. But my mom keeps telling me to stop 'cause she's worried it'll leave marks. Oh, so that's what was going on. But it's not like you have any other way to practice, yeah? I know, right? Why don't you just ignore her and do it anyway? She's really scary when she gets mad. Last time she caught me hitting the wall she chased me all 'round the place with a carpet beater. Guess you can't ignore that. Badminton, huh? I used to play it with my brother when I was little. You did? Yeah. But we ended up losing the shuttlecock, so I haven't played in ages. I can help you practice if you can't do wall drills. Really? Th-Then let's go— Wait, not now. She just gave me work to do. Oh, right. Sorry to be like this after you offered and all. Don't worry about it. Back to work for me! It's the first day, and I'm already exhausted! We're going kayaking tomorrow, huh? The place is supposed to be like the jungle, right? It should be a lot of fun. I'm going snorkeling. Ta-dah! I got cup ramen from the inn shop! We've just had dinner. You're going to eat more? Well, why not? Hika-nee, you want one too? Yeah, sure. Empore, empore. What is she even saying? Nattsun, you'll get told off if you eat snacks after a meal. Oh? You don't get it, do you, Ren-chon? What do you mean? There are no adults here to tell us off. In other words, we make our own rules. If we wanna eat ramen or stay up all night, we can. Sure you don't want any, Ren-chon? The ramen's good! Yup! Come on, Natsumi. Don't lead Renge down the wrong path. You say that, but we're eating it too. Once we're done with the ramen, let's play cards! It's okay to stay up longer when it's already nine? I declare it so! Wow! Konomi-chan, lend me some playing cards. Sure. Sis and Ren-chon are asleep. Should we go to bed too? Yeah. I'm sleepy after swimming and all. I'm next to Senpai. What should I do? Five more minutes... I can't let her see me act so childishly! When do we need to get up tomorrow again? Oh, breakfast is at eight. Got it. Good night. Huh? There was something that was bothering me. But I can't remember what it was. Well, let's worry about it tomorrow, then. I'm turning off the lights. Okay. Good night. Yes, good night. Night! Why am I the only one sleeping on the floor?! Where am I? I'm in Okinawa! It's eight already! Hotaru. It's time to get up. Just a little longer... Hotaru! Just five more minutes, Mom! Um... Get ready. We're gonna get breakfast. O-Okay! We're off! Have a good day! It's the sea! It's Okinawa! I don't know how I ended up in the snorkeling group, but I sure am looking forward to it! Right? I hear we might even see some manta rays if we're lucky. Manta rays, huh? All right! I won't miss 'em! Will there be dolphins too? If we get lucky. Climb down nice and slowly. Okay. Everyone, are you ready? Stay with me, okay? Okay. Hika-nee, Hika-nee! Check out all the coral down there! Hika... Huh? What's wrong? I feel sick. The waves are making me nauseous. Hika-nee, hang in there! Candy Lady! There're fish! There sure are. Let's go a little farther out. I see a manta ray over here! Candy Lady, what did he say he saw? A manta ray. Not a dolphin? Yeah. It's like a big fish. Wanna go see it? I'll go see it! Hey, don't go alone! Manta rays're amazing! Hey, there's a manta ray! Hika-nee, a manta ray showed up! I see. First the flight, and now the waves... My vestibular system might be a lost cause. We're gonna miss the manta ray if we don't go now! You were so determined to see it! That's the least of my problems right now. Do you see any plastic bags floating around us? What, plastic bags? Wait, Hika-nee? The path to the kayaking spot already feels like a jungle. I hope there aren't any freaky bugs. It should be okay. Let's keep moving, girls. Don't block the path for others. Ooh, Kazu-chan's acting like a teacher! Well, I am a teacher. We've reached the kayaks! Everybody! Please hold the paddle so that both your elbows are at a ninety-degree angle! Also, we have both single and tandem kayaks. Please tell us your preference before choosing a kayak! There are two kinds, huh? Single ones are apparently easier to balance, so should we go with those? Let's go with tandems. Let's go with tandems! I heard you the first time. I mean, kayaking alone sounds scary. There won't be anyone to pull you out if it capsizes. If a tandem kayak capsizes, the other person will be in the water too. Hotaru, let's ride together. Okay! Hold it while I get on, okay? All right! Be careful! Senpai! Senpai! I hope they'll be all right. The scenery is amazing! It is! There's a crab! It's got a huge claw! That must be a fiddler crab. And the fish behind it looks like a mudskipper. Cool! Let's go check out the weird tree over there! Uh, would that be a mangrove? Those round leaves look lovely! Let's get a little closer. Senpai, if you get too close... Huh? W-We'll need to make a slight turn. D-Don't rush. If you try to turn too quickly... The kayak got stuck! Oh no, I can't get it out! Konomi-chan! We got stuck. Come help us! We can't go over there because of the current. No! What do we do? Can't you use your paddle to push against the branch? It looks like I need to pull it away, but I can't reach it. Sensei! Save us! My, what are you kids doing? Our kayak got stuck in a tree! I'll hold the branch, so try pushing against it with the paddle. Okay. We're out! Thank you so much, Sensei! Sure. Let's get moving so we don't fall too far behind. Hey! Did you manage to get out all right? Yes, Sensei helped us! We're hiking up the mountain next, right? Yeah. We'll be going all the way up to the waterfall. The instructor will prepare lunch for us. Oh yeah, I left my drink in the car. What? They told you to bring one with you. I forgot to bring mine too, actually. Don't worry. I saw you'd forgotten them, so I brought them with me. You did? Along with some candies and cooling sheets to keep us going. You're prepared! Oh, I'd love some candy. Here you go. Thank you! Thanks for waiting! We're going to start the hike! Okay, let's go! Watch your step. Wow! I can feel the spray all the way from here! I can feel the negative ions doing us good! Good work, everyone! Please feel free to swim while we get your lunch ready. You heard her! Let's go, Hotaru! Yes! It's so cold! We probably shouldn't dive right in when it's this cold. You're right. Let's let our bodies get used to it. The cool water feels so good! Oh, it's you, Kazu-nee. You scared us. Sorry about that. You know, you've been different from usual today. You think so? Not only did you save us while we were kayaking, you also came prepared for the hike, which was a great help. You seem much more energetic, too! I'm not sure how to describe it. It's as though all the sunshine has lightened up my spirit. It makes me feel excited, like I'm a child again. I hope you don't run out of steam on our way back! Not to worry. I'm bursting with energy right now! Kazu-chan! I'll take a photo, so strike a pose! Oh, thanks! All right, here it goes! And pose! Hello, Konomi? What's up? What? Argh... Yeah, give her a stern talking-to. All right. Got it. What's going on? Apparently Big Sis has practically glued her butt to a bench at the harbor. Says she's tired. I got some photos too. This is her "before" image... and here's the "after." Give me a break. If they're at the harbor, we should get our pictures with the lighthouse and head back. Renge, are you done drawing the lighthouse? I'm done. Great. Let's take one last picture! It's a hermit crab! I didn't know they could live so far away from the water. Huh, wait a second. Hika-nee, isn't that a land hermit crab? The protected species? What? Wow, you just caught a protected species alive. What's wrong? Is that illegal? Am I going to be arrested for this? Damn it! I'm taking a photo with it in front of the lighthouse! Hika-nee! Wait up! I'm coming too! Jeez, I thought she didn't care about the lighthouse. Candy Lady, we need the camera! Hurry up! I'm on my way. Just wait a sec. Make sure you get the hermit crab! You think something that small is gonna show up? Say cheese! All right! Now take one with me in it! We're finally back at the inn. I can't say it was an easy journey. Could you two pick up the keys and unlock the rooms? We've already got our hands full here. Oh, sure. Welcome back! Doing the cleaning? Yeah, though I'm basically finished. Oh, we should play badminton, then! Like we said yesterday! What? Really? I'll only have time until dinner. Is that all right? Okay! I'll go get the rackets! And when I took a look into the ocean, it was full of coral! Wow, that must've been nice. There was a manta ray too! That huge, flat fish? Yes! I didn't see any dolphins, though. I wanna see one so I can finish my drawings. We're leaving in two days, though. I'm not sure we'll get to see them. In two days, huh? You're checking out in two days? Oh, yeah. It was a four-day trip we won. We drew it in a raffle at the department store. Or well, Bro did. Wow, that must've been great. I never win at that kinda stuff. I mean, those sorts of things. Again, you don't have to watch your language around us. Okay! But it's nice you got a department store nearby. We don't have any 'round here. You can't get to ours without a car, either. All we've got are mountains, streams, and farmland. Really? I wonder what it's like. I can show you. I have a sketchbook in my room. Right, you made a lot of drawings, huh? I see! You know what? You should come over to our room! I'm gonna sleep on the bed in the adults' room. You guys can do whatever you want over there. I'll drop by if my mom says it's okay! Wow! It looks like a wonderful place. This is our school, and this is Gu. Gu? That's the raccoon dog's name. And this is the one I drew before we left for Okinawa. There's a tree like that near here too. Ooh, I wanna show my drawings to that tree! We don't have any plans for tomorrow, right? Are there any fun places you'd recommend? Actually, just come with us! I'd love to be your guide, but I need to clean the inn in the morning. I see. Sorry about that. I should get going. Good night. Good night! So what are we doing tomorrow? Good question. I just had an idea! I've got a great plan! I'm sleeping on the floor either way?! May I come in? Okay! Excuse me. It's time for breakfast. Morning! Are you cleaning the room? Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it. Oh, it's just... Well, we're just tidying up after ourselves, and uh... This was Sis's suggestion, not mine, but we thought if we cleaned our own rooms and left you less work... then maybe you'd have time to show us around. Huh? Aoi! Mom? If that's what our guests want, you should show them around the island. But... Don't worry about it. I can take care of the work today. Really? Yup! This is my school! What? This is a school? Even the school has that Okinawan feel! Can we go inside? Probably not inside the building. Aoi! Oh, you're here. Yeah, I was cleaning the club room. Uh, this is my friend from the badminton club. These girls are guests at our inn. Oh, and this one's the same age as us! Cool! Hello! Hello. Oh yeah, you said you were here to clean the club room, right? In that case... Thanks for waiting! I borrowed some rackets and shuttlecocks! She says we can use them until she's done cleaning! Badminton! All right, here goes, Natsumi! Don't hit it too hard, okay? I know, I know! What did I just say? I could never return that! C'mon. I didn't even hit it that hard. There! Non! Here goes. Non! There! Here goes. There! Non! I can't do this. Let's switch. Aoi-chan, you've got to teach Natsumi a lesson! Huh? Sis, you're bowing out already? Well, not that I mind. I'll get to go all-out against Aoi-chan. All right, I'm not going to hold back, so you'd better play hard too! Sure! The shuttlecock just vanished. It's behind you! W-Well, I can't say I was going all out. Just a little slip-up. Now, let's play for real! Say your prayers! I need a break. You okay? Maybe I overdid it a bit. Aoi-san, you're good. That was amazing. That's the slice of humble pie she needed. All right! She should be almost done cleaning the club room now, so why don't we go somewhere cooler? Okay! Where are we going? Well, I was thinking of taking you to a sweet little café nearby. H-Hold it! The match... hasn't been decided yet... Um, I'm pretty sure it has. It takes my breath away every time. For sure. We don't have our swimsuits today, though. So we can't swim. That's okay. We're not here to swim. Then what are we doing? Try pushing your hand against the sand, nice and hard. See anything stuck on there? It's just sand. Take a closer look. There are little stars on my hand! And on mine! I can see them too! They're so pretty! Here you go. You can fill these bottles with star sand and take them home. Wow! Thank you so much! Thanks! It's the last night. And I will... sleep on the... bed at all costs! I've been betrayed by kids and adults alike. I'm not going to budge an inch from here! Gosh, stop throwing a tantrum like a child. I'm back. Senpai, where were you? They had cup noodles for sale in the dining room, so I bought some. Hey! If the kids catch us eating them, they'll be all over us. Take it easy. The most delicious ramen is that which is eaten behind others' backs! So what did you get? Let me show you. This one's soy, and this one's miso. Oh, I've got udon too. Eating late-night snacks makes you fat... but I guess I can make an exception. So adults break the rules just as much as kids do! I'll take one, though. I can't pack it all in! Me neither. I barely bought any souvenirs, too. Oh right, Ren-chan, you didn't get to see the dolphins. Yes. There's one drawing I still need to make. Uh, do you have some time? What's this thing you want to show us? You'll see when we get there! Walking at night is frightening, but it's also exciting! It is! Over here! Wow! The stars, the sea... They're all glowing. It's so... These are sea sparkle algae! Huh? They're algae? My mom said we should be able to see them well tonight, so I thought I'd show you. It's beautiful! That's amazing! Aoi-chan... Thank you. Sure! All right, I'm done packing! Are you ready too? Yeah, we are. My bag's gotten a lot heavier. Seems like it. Ren-chan, we should get going. Oh right, you didn't get to draw any dolphins. No, but I drew something else. It turned out well. Let's go. Oh, okay. Hey, Ren-chon. We're leaving. Hang on a minute. What's going on? The thing is... Nattsun started tearing up. She doesn't want to leave yet. Whoa, she's seriously crying. How could the time fly by so quickly? Natsumi, don't cry. You're in middle school now. Being in middle school has nothing to do with it. The high schooler's crying too. I'm not crying! You too? Take care, everyone! Thanks for showing us around. We had a great time! That's great to hear! Hope to see you again! Thank you! Nattsun! I'll send you a photo of my school when I get back. Okay! And I'll practice badminton so I can beat you next time! Sure! We're back! That was a blast! It sure was! We were only gone for a few days, but it feels like we've been away for ages. Yeah. Ren-chon, what are you doing? I'm showing our countryside to my drawings from Okinawa. I see. You guys have anything lined up for tomorrow? We should hang out if you don't. Oh, I'm free. I wanna take the day to wind down at home. Nattsun, you can have this one. Thank you, Ren-chon. We should visit Okinawa again next year, Big Sis. I can't afford to make this a regular thing. Oh, come on. I just can't. I still wanna go again. Right. Well, maybe we'll go there together again someday. Yes, we'll go together. It's the usual smell. I'm home!
