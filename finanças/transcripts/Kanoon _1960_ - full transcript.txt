You Tube - Video Running Time 02:24:59 You Tube search name - Kanoon - Ganpat? - Yes. - Have you heard something? - What? - You know that Kaalidas? - Yes. He's back after serving ten years in jail. Kaalidas, he couldn't harm me ten years ago. What can he do to me now, after getting out of jail? Kaalidas. Do you accept that you murdered Ganpat? Yes, I do. And do you also accept that you murdered him while in your senses? Yes, I accept that I murdered him while in my senses. Even though you knew the sentence for murder is death? Yes judge sir... I know the sentence for murder is death. And along with that I even know... that your law can't punish me. Why can't the law punish you for your crimes? All the knowledgeable people of the law sitting here... can turn truth into falsehood. I, I want to ask something before giving my answer. Ask what? Judge sir, can a person be killed twice? What do you want to say? I don't understand. I'll try to explain it again. Look at me carefully. I'm the same Kaalidas who was sentenced... to ten to life imprisonment for... the murder of this same Ganpat. I want to ask this court, if Ganpat was murdered... ten years ago... then why have I been brought here today? And if Ganpat has been murdered today... then why was I sentenced to ten years imprisonment? Your honor, the suspect is lying. He's wasting the court's time. The suspect is a criminal. The proof is those ten years he spent in jail. That's what I'm asking the public prosecutor, sir. What was that crime for which I spent... ten years of my life in the dark corners of prison? I was kept away from happiness, light and fresh air. Are you saying that ten years ago... you were captured for the murder of this Ganpat? Yes judge sir, and today I've... been captured again for the murder of that Ganpat. How is that possible? It's possible, sir. But what isn't possible is for the law to return to me... the ten years my life that I spent in jail. And it's also not possible that the hatred... filling every part of my body... be dispelled by the law. A respected and honest Kaalidas... died behind the prison bars. And a goon, Kaalidas, took his place... who hates every person, every society and the law. Your honor, the suspect is trying to deceive the court. This is a false story. It does seem like a story, sir. But the one who has lived it, ask him. It's not just one story. There are many such stories that have been written... in many courts and there's no one left now to narrate them. If I had been hanged to death... then even I wouldn't have been able to narrate my story. I ask, if the law can't return something it takes... then what right does it have to take it in the first place? Sir, just take a look at the woman sitting before you. She has been insulted for the past ten years... just because she's my wife, a murderer's wife. Sir, I ask for her youth back from you. I ask for all the nights she spent and... that she's sacrificed because of me! I ask for all her beautiful smiles that... the law has turned into wrinkles! I ask for the price of her helplessness... for her every drop of blood dripped... from her heart and the tears from her eyes, sir! I ask for the price of her tears, sir! I ask you, why was she made to suffer along with me? Do you have the answer sir? Do you have the answer? The one who isn't caught is respectable in the sight of the law. Ten years ago, I kept saying in this very court... that I'm innocent. I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. But no one listened to me. Today, today I say that I'm the murderer. I have murdered Ganpat. And no law can harm me. Because no law can punish me twice for the same crime. Now judge sir, I ask you. Am I the murderer or your law? Mr. Jha, what do you think about this case? Such chaos keeps taking place at Badri Prasad's court. Anyway, forget about this story. Kaalidas is dead, and the case is over. Yes, Kaalidas is dead, but his death has raised a question. What's that? About the witnesses being fake? No, about that death sentence. If the death sentence is repealed... then the humans will turn the city into a jungle. You should know, that a human is an animal by nature. And is only afraid of death. In other words, you want to say... that if humans are no longer afraid of death... they'll turn into monsters. Exactly. But, if the witness and their testimonies are fake... as happened in the Kalidaas case... and if an innocent man is sentenced to death... then who is the real suspect? Meaning? I mean, what if someone is sentenced wrongly? Then the case can be reopened. The criminal can be released again. But if he's sentenced to death, then... Tomorrow you'll also say, stop punishing the suspects. Exceptions do not prove the rule, Mr. Savalkar. Even if Kaalidas's testimony is true... I'll still be in favor of the death sentence. Because Kaalidas's story was a coincidence. And such coincidences don't happen every time. Right, Badri Prasad? Yes, yes, Badri Prasad. You're just sitting here. Say something. The case was yours. - I'm just listening. - Just listening won't do. Jha sir is our senior judge. He's also elder to all of us. That's why I don't want to go against what he says. But Mr. Jha, the coincidence that happened today... must have happened before also. It might happen again. So you're also against the death sentence? Yes, you know I've never yet sentenced anyone to death. Because I think that justice depends only on the testimony. And the testimony can be wrong or right. In other words, you want to say we're cruel. We give death sentences to innocent people. We let the criminals remain free... so they can harm the community. I didn't know your opinion... - of human beings was so bad. - That's not it. I meant that a human being is never alone. He is a father, son, brother, friend, husband. That's the why the testimony can never be correct. If the testimony is wrong, the justice is wrong. If the testimony is right, the justice is right. Right Savalkar? That's exactly what I say. If the testimony is wrong, the justice is wrong. If the testimony is right, the justice is right. I don't agree with that. You may not agree but... the truth is the most honest person... doesn't speak the truth all the time. For example, profit-loss, emotional relationships... familiar-unfamiliar stand like a wall in front of him. And then, and then he becomes so helpless that... the truth is suppressed right in front of him. But he doesn't even open his mouth. Stop talking like a child. By saying that, you've proven... all justice before now in favor of humanity is wrong. You don't know that murder itself is... a noose that loops around the murderer's neck. And then brings him in front of the law one day. You're speaking of book knowledge, Mr. Jha. It doesn't happen that way in real life. How can you say it doesn't happen? You are a very big and famous judge, very influential. Murder someone and try to escape from it. - Mr. Jha. - You're laughing. I'm prepared to... bet my whole salary on it. Jha sir, you're getting old. Keep it. It will help you. Afraid? Come on. Place a bet, murder someone... and don't get punished for it. Okay, then you have a bet, but you'll loose. - Okay then, the bet is on. - I don't know about win or lose. But the case will be quite interesting. Second judge committed to session. - Sensational. - Sensational! Second judge committed to session! - Bye. - Bye-bye. Meena. Can I come inside? So you're still roaming around in vest and towel? Not ready yet! What were you doing all this time? What are you asking? See for yourself. That I can see, these trousers, this tie... this hanger, this coat. - What's all this? - That's what I'm saying. Is anything in its place? My house looks very similar to a zoo. - That's true. - What? But what's your problem? What are you searching for? That. Shirt. - Shirt? - Yes. - Is this the one? - That's it. I've been looking for it for an hour. Kailash, may I tell you something? - Tell me. - You're very stupid. That I am. Otherwise I wouldn't have been a bachelor this long. I have a wonderful house, a good job... my would-be wife is standing before me. And I've been looking for a shirt all this time Meena, now this lonely house haunts me. Come quickly to me. I've come. And see, I'm taking you along with me. Not like this, but as my wife. If you're so anxious, then why not talk to papa? Whenever I think about talking to your father about marriage... some problem arises. Today Kaalidas's case came up. The poor man even served his prison sentence and then died. Judge sir was very worried about this case. Look Kailash, you'll not talk about the court. Whenever father comes, he talks about court. Whenever you come, you talk about court. All the young couples of the world talk about love. And even I had to fall in love with a lawyer. Each time I have to hear about murder and robbery. Whenever I talk about love, you shy away. Whenever I talk about the court, you become afraid. Anyway, did judge sir return home? He came back. I bought tickets for the theater. I thought I'd take you along too. You take care of me so well before marriage. What about after we're married? I'll pick your pocket. - Now come on, we're very late. - Come. Here is my dear sister Meena! Sister Meena, sister, sister where have you been? I've been searching for you. - Hi Kailash. - Hi lover. Where are you going, dressed up so nice? Where else? Our social service society. Oh yes, I forgot. You also perform services for the country. But Vijay, don't you think there are a few too many girls in your society? They aren't enough. Shortage! I'm still searching for the one. Sister, sister. Sister, sister I have some business with you. - How much money do you want? - What is this, sister? Whenever I come to you, you think I want something. But sister, today I really want something. I have to make a donation to the Bengal Health Committee. Only 20 rupees. Okay, you've hidden the purse here. No problem. Don't worry. I'll help myself. 10, sister you are great. 20, sister you are wonderful. Sister, sister I'm telling you the truth. You are really very nice. 20 only. Okay Meena, bye. Kailash, bye. Come on, let's take papa along. - Is papa upstairs? - Yes, upstairs. Papa! Papa! What is this papa? You're still not ready. Oh, I'm supposed to go to the theater. I forgot all about it. Go and get ready now. Look dear, I was thinking, I'm not well. I should rest. - If you're not well, we won't go, either. - Yes, that's right. What is this? You're children. Why drag me into this? - Go, go, go. - No father, we won't go. - Kailash, please take her. - You come, too. No, no, you people go. Vijay took money from you for a donation? Just look. The committee has come along. Oh God! Come on, come on. Shut up, shut up. Audience, the play to be performed is a ballet. Which means a theatrical dance and a musical play. The story is, a fairy comes down to earth. And prince and princess see her flying. The princess tells the prince to bring her the wings. She wants to fly, too. You know that foolishness in love. The prince goes to the fairy to please the princess. He asks for the wings. The fairy refuses. The prince, blinded by love, kills the fairy. The princess is frightened after seeing all this. She had asked for the wings, not her blood. I liked the play very much. What about you? I didn't like the ending. The prince shouldn't have killed the fairy. People are blind in love. They can do anything. This was just a drama. Even I can kill someone for you. - Just ask me and see. - No, no. Let's go! Okay madam, now I take your leave. - So soon. - Soon? It's already 11:30. You have college in the morning and I have court. Okay, tell me when we'll meet tomorrow? - In the morning? - Not in the morning. I'll meet you in the evening. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. - Good night. - Sweet dreams. See you tomorrow. - Okay. - Good night. Papa, did you go out somewhere? Yes dear. I was feeling a little uneasy sitting at home. I went out for a little stroll. The theater was nice? - It was very nice. - Really? It would have been nicer if you had come with us. Yes, better if I came along. But dear, this isn't our age to watch plays. Shall I bring coffee? It's late now. Good night. Good night papa. Sir, why have you called me? Let me first congratulate you. Your first husband Ganpat has died. You're free. Double congratulations sir. I'm free from you, too, now. You made me suffer a lot. Now I won't give you even a penny! This world is of give and take. Every work has its own price. Even though your first husband... was alive you married again, to a rich man. And I, even though I knew this secret I kept quiet. There has to be some price for that. Now you can't harm me in any way. Ganpat is dead. He's dead now, but was alive when you... married for the second time. Shall I show you the marriage certificate? It's in the safe. I've always played a winning game, madam. This property you've inherited will slip out of your hands... just like that. How will I lose it? You already know. But I'll still tell you. Getting married a second time while the first husband was still alive... is against the law. And this property doesn't belong to your first husband. It belongs to the second. All I have to do is open my mouth. Aren't you ashamed, Dhaniram? You pose as an important philantropist. You donate to various causes! And secretly you act like a con man! Don't mix those two things together. A man's secret life is different from his public life. Take a look at yourself. From the outside you look like a goddess, but on the inside... Even though the first husband was alive... you got married a second time. It has not been long since the second one died... yet you're already looking for the third one. I've heard he's also a big man. - Who is he? - Dhaniram! There's no use in fighting with each other. There's a saying, as long as you keep feeding the dog... it'll keep its mouth shut. There are many other ways to keep the dog's mouth shut. Oh boy. Greetings, Dhaniram sir. Greetings. You had a really good-looking customer just now. Who was that cat? Younger judge sir, don't think about eating... all the grapes on the grape wine. Have you brought the money? Have the brought the money? Don't be angry with me for someone else's fault. Speak nicely to me. - You look better that way. - The hell I look better this way. I haven't received the principal or the interest... in the last year because... I talk this way. Everything is in the safe deposit sir. The thief has the job... of safeguarding the gold. Everything is in the safe deposit sir. Am I dead that I'd let you keep it? May your enemies die, sir. You're my only support during bad times. Just think that today this support has broken. You've already had a year. Don't forget you signed... a blank paper and gave it to me. Blank paper, but you said you'd never use it. If I don't use it, then will I lick it... after putting honey on it? Dhaniram, you're very cunning. I'm cunning because I'm asking for my own money. Listen, if by tomorrow you still haven't returned it... I'll take possession of all your father's properties. You'll take father's property? Seven thousand! You have to give Dhaniram seven thousand? And you even signed a blank paper. Yes, Meena, Meena please save me. If father finds out, he won't spare me. If you fear papa so much, then why did you go there? You're older than me and you're still not ashamed. - But Meena I... - And you do this with papa still alive? - What will happen when papa passes? - But Meena... - Will you sell us too? Brother, didn't you think about it even once? You risked all your father's earnings. You only think about your own pleasure and forget everything else. Now tell me, where will I get 7,000 rupees by tomorrow? Forget about this lecture Meena. Meena, I know I'm a fool, donkey, idiot, stupid. But, but Meena, I'm your elder brother. Please, please, Meena, forgive me. Look, it's a question of papa's honor. Save him, save me too. Look, I promise, gentlemen's promise. I'll never do anything like this again. I won't, never again. Please, please. My sister Meena. But, what can I do? This is very bad. Dhaniram is a very cunning person. Once stuck in his clutches there's no escape. Is there no solution? Why not? I'll go to him. - Let me see what he says. - When will you go? Today, today there's a dinner for the bar association. It'll be over at 10:30 or 11:00. No problem, I'll go there after that. Won't it be very late? When we have to do the work, then we shouldn't see the time. I'll wake him from his sleep. After all, I'm a police man. I have some influence. I'm very worried. Silly, as long as I'm there, why worry? Everything will be okay again. I'll surely go tonight, no matter what. Come on. "Raghupati, Raghav, King Ram... the sacred, divine, Sita, Ram." Who's come so late at night? Won't even let me drink milk peacefully. Coming, coming. A God has come to a pauper's house. Come lawyer sir, come. How amazing, today after many years. I got to see both of them. Lawyer sir, will you sit on the sofa or the chair? We have Indian and Western, both types of seating arrangements. Sit here on the chair. I keep it for people like you. Sit, sit. How's your mood, Dhaniram sir? Lawyer sir, important people like you have moods. I'm a very poor person. Why did you take the trouble... of coming so late in the night? I want to talk to you. Take a seat. Lawyer sir, we can talk some other time also. You've come after a long time. Let me serve you. - It doesn't matter. - No, take a seat. I'll be right back Lawyer sir, I live alone. That's why I didn't hire a servant. I do everything myself. The color is really nice, sir. It's a really good sherbert, lawyer sir. Drink and see for yourself. Dear! Even the taste isn't bad. - Did you mix any booze in this? - Ram, Ram, Ram, Ram lawyer sir. Neither do I take intoxicants nor do I give any out. If you don't get them drunk, how do you get them to sign blank papers? What? Dhaniram, this time I've come as a friend. And I want to tell you you've made arrangements to go to jail. What are you saying, lawyer sir? The trap you set for Vijay, you're now caught in it yourself. If I bring the police and have them search your house... they'll find many documents like the one you took from Vijay. And the result will be your arrest. But lawyer sir, why are you talking like this? Just a minute. Lawyer sir, here is Vijay's document. I trust you a lot. You keep this with you and take a look. There's nothing written on it except for Vijay's name. And see, 4000 is the principal amount and 3000 is the interest. You get me the principal amount. And the interest, I know you're a respectable man. Get me half of it and I'll forgive the remaining half. Judge sir. Why has he come here? It seems judge sir has come here for the same purpose. I don't want him to see me here. Dhaniram, please don't tell him. Dhaniram, I'll hide in that room. Judge sir, why did you take the trouble? You should have sent a message and I'd have come myself. It is my good fate you've come. Is the work done? I didn't do anything! I'm innocent, sir. I'm innocent! - Blood. - No! I didn't do anything! I'm innocent! Please release me! Please release me! Please release me! Good morning papa. Good morning dear. Get up father. It's morning already. The morning comes very early these days. Papa, you returned very late last night. Where did you go? Where did I go? Oh yes, I was at a party. Today is Wednesday, the 1st day of July. - Now, the news in Hindi. - Look, I even forgot to remove my watch. Today's main news is... Shall I make it? Prime minister gave a speech keeping Calcutta students in mind. Did you wait up for me? I think I must have returned after midnight. - Cigarette? Did Vijay get up? - Yes. water problem will be solved... Because of the floods in Bihar... there has been loss of life and property. At about midnight, the city's famous wealthy man Dhaniram was murdered. Where are you going, dear? I'll be right back, papa, Right back. Go. I was so scared. Kailash, Kailash did you hear? Dhaniram was murdered. - I know. - You know? How do you know? Okay, so you fell asleep reading the newspaper again? You're very lazy. Mister, move your leg. Famous rich person Dhaniram murdered. - The murderer was caught. - The murderer is caught? What happened Kailash? If you hadn't read the newspaper... how did you know Dhaniram was murdered. Answer me Kaliash. You went there last night. What happened Kailash. Why are you quiet? Answer me Kaliash. You went there. Tell me, tell me Kailash! I have only one child, lnspector sir. I swear on him that I didn't murder him. I'm not a murderer. I do steal, but that's my weakness. I am very ill. I cannot work. I want to but people don't hire me. The doctor tells me to work. My stomach tells me to work. What work can I do? That's why I steal. I swear on my child sir. I didn't commit the murder. Please have pity on me. Please have pity on me, sir. - Come, Kailash sir. - Hello lnspector. - Come, take seat. - Thank you. I didn't kill Dhaniram, sir. Please have pity on me. See sir, tell me, can I murder anyone? If I lie then I'll die right now. I didn't commit the murder. I didn't commit the murder. If you didn't commit the murder, then how did you get caught? What's the case, lnspector? It's a very simple case, lawyer, sir. It's a cold-blooded murder. This man is Kaalia. He went to Dhaniram's house to steal. He must have caught him and then he must have stabbed him. - What evidence do you have? - There is much. His foot prints on the spilled milk near the dead body. Fingerprints on the knife. He was caught coming out of the house with his hands covered in blood. What other evidence do you need? But he denies it, lnspector sir. Has anyone ever confessed, Lawyer sir? Every murderer says he's innocent. But I didn't commit the murder, sir! I'm innicent. - Take him away! - I'm innocent. I'm innocent I didn't do anything! I didn't do anything! He's dead. Hello. How are you? What's wrong? Why are you laughing? Kailash, oh wow. You look exactly like the secret police. Just like a detective, detective. - Vijay. - Yes. Come on. Kailash, did you hear? Dhaniram is no more. Oh God, that day he scolded me so much. "If you don't bring the money tomorrow... I'll transfer transfer your father's property to my name using this blank paper." I will write, and he has written it. Vijay, listen to me Vijay. - Did you... - I had him killed? No, no. Look Kailash. Kailash, you're my brother. Never think that of me. I don't even know Kaalia. I've never ever seen him. lmpossible, I don't even know what he looks like. You fool. I am asking if you'll tell your father. Do you think I have a death wish? I had to hide it from him. Why would I tell him? Poor Dhaniram. Then why did judge sir do this? I don't know why. Yes, sometimes I do consider myself the suspect. You're such a respected man. And I made you commit crimes for your own benefit. Listen, if I ask you for forgiveness for this crime... don't forgive me. - Shankar! - Coming sir. Where's everybody gone? Young madam has gone out. Judge sir hasn't returned yet. Shall I bring tea or coffee? No. The human mind is very strange. After that argument in the chamber... and the bet with Mr. Jha... I feel like I should murder someone. So that's it. Human lives are being examined. It's wrong to read someone's diary. Yes, I am sorry. But... What's there to hide from you? You're my own. Here, read it. Kailash, if you want to see someone's real self... then you should read his diary. There's only show on the outside. It's just show on the outside. I really believe that. Some people are really human beings on the outside... but devils on the inside. It can be also said... there are many different people hidden inside a person. They're very different in look, character and mentality. They're opposites. There's a devil inside a human being... and a human being inside a devil. What's the matter? Why are you looking at me like that? Are you worried? Is there something important? Last night my mind was stuck on a strange problem. Can I help in any way? A lot. - Tell me. - I'm reading a story. The character in the story goes to a house to kill someone. It has a very nice beginning. And he kills him. The murderer thinks there's no one else in the house but the victim. There was someone there? Yes, a man was hiding behind the curtains at that time. - How interesting. - What did he do? - He kept quiet. - Why did he keep quiet? Because he has an emotional relation with the murderer. The same old story. Maybe that's why he didn't even inform the police. Yes. That means the murderer is free. It's a very nice story, and... Now, you explain how the story should go. What will happen? Someone else will be caught. Absolutely right. But how do you know that? Just guessing. If that doesn't happen, then there's no fun to the story. How does your story end? I haven't reached the end yet. But I believe... one day the soul of the murderer will make so him helpless... he'll hand himself over to the law. And will save an innocent person from a death sentence. You're still a child, Kailash. A murderer doesn't have a soul. Actually, a murderer first murders his soul. He won't surrender himself to the police? If murderer's hand themselves over to the law... then there's no need of courts. Maybe you're right. That means you understood my meaning. Absolutely. - Hello Mister. - Hello Mister. Silence! Case number 55311. State versus Kaalia. Member. of the jury, suspect Kaalia has been arrested... under section 302 of the Indian penal court. A human being is charged under section... 302 only when he has murdered someone... while in his senses. Suspect Kaalia's crime is that he entered... victim Dhaniram's house on the 30th of June... at Civil Lines and killed him. Do you confess to the crime? Sir, I didn't murder anyone. I am innocent, I am innocent sir. You tell me, could I murder anyone? I tell the truth. But no one listens to me. Sir, no one can save me besides you. You're the judge. You know everything, sir. You know everything. Only answer yes or no whether you confess to the crime. I haven't killed anyone. How can I confess, sir? - Do you have a lawyer? - You're my lawyer, sir. I'm a very poor man. Where would I find a lawyer? And I haven't even stolen anything for many days, sir. You don't have a lawyer? Your honor, I'm his lawyer. You? But Mr. Kailash, you're a public prosecutor. How can you take his case? I was a public prosecutor. No longer. I've resigned. Why did you resign, Kailash? Since Dhaniram's murder... I can't understand anything you say. I love you a lot Kailash... I'm about to become your wife, Kailash. I love you a lot. If you hide anything from me, I'll be very hurt. Tell me, tell me why you left that job. I couldn't have done anything else. But why? Because Kaalia is innocent. - That's why. - How do you know? May I ask you something, Kailash? When you went to Dhaniram's house, was he alive? Answer me Kailash. Was he alive? And when you returned, was he alive? Who is the murderer? Kailash, I can hide all your crimes. Tell me, tell me who is the murderer. A man cannot tell a lie, and he can't speak the truth. Silence is the best answer. Don't try to confuse me, Kailash. I've lost my sleep and appetite! I'm very worried! My mind has stopped working! - I want to hear it! - You want to hear? You know the murderer very well. You very well know how he looks, talks and behaves. If I tell you the name you'll get cold feet. You need a very strong heart to hear his name! Shall I tell you his name? 'You killed Dhaniram, Kailash.' 'You.' - Hello Mr. Jha. - Come, Mr. Jha. Now take out your wallet and place a bet. - Order ma'am? - Coffee. I'll be back. There. - Hello papa. - Hello Kailash. Hello Meena. Sit. Kailash, I wanted to ask you. Why did you resign? - Because of you. - Because of me? You said murderers don't have a soul. The question here is also about the soul. That means you... Kaalia is innocent, judge sir. My soul says if I can't catch the real murderer... at least I can save an innocent person. - You think Kaalia is innocent? - Yes. Do you know who the murderer is? Why are you looking at me like that? Don't say anything to him right now. He's not well. I know you have more right on him than I. And then after marriage you'll have even more right. But I still have some influence on him from the law perstective. Right, Kailash? You're right. I'll be right there. Hello, Badri Prasad. I can't come now. I'll be a little late. I'm with Kailash and Meena. Okay. You took a long time to return. 'It seems the judge has turned a deaf ear to his soul.' 'The matter hasn't progressed at all.' 'Meena thinks I'm Dhaniram's killer.' 'I can't tell her the name of the real killer.' 'Love makes a person very helpless.' 'I'm very confused right now.' 'What should I do? What shouldn't I do?' 'I don't understand anything.' Case number 55311! The state versus Kaalia! Your honor, I represent the state. Proceed Mr. Khanna. Respected members of the jury. The suspect stands before you. You all know very well why he's been brought before all of you. Before narrating the murder I would like... to tell you about the suspect and what he does. I object your honor! The identity of the suspect and his profession... has no connection with the case. Objection overruled. I'd like to say again, your honor... the jury is being influenced against me. Mr. Kailash, the jury isn't inexperienced. The jury has made decisions in many cases. Proceed Mr. Khanna. As I was saying, members of the jury... who is the suspect? The suspect is a thief, a criminal. He's been convicted many times. He was released from prison... just 8 days before this murder. If his sentence had been a bit longer... or if he had been released 8 days later... Dhaniram would be alive today. Your honor, no one can be called a criminal... before he's found guilty. My client is being called a criminal before being found guilty. Objection sustained. The public prosecutor's statement should not be considered. Members of the jury, note that. Mr. Khanna, you know what the real case is. Dhaniram's murder, your honor. Proceed please. But please don't deviate from the real case. Yes your honor. Members of the jury, the real events are clear as day. It will be better if you hear the story... from someone who was there. With the permission of the court... I request that lnspector Das come to the witness stand. Sub-lnspector Das please! I swear in the name of the law... I will speak the truth and nothing but the truth. Sub-lnspector Das, is it true... you were on duty in the same area as Dhaniram's house? - Yes. - Is it also true... that during your rounds you passed Dhaniram's house? - Yes. - What did you see there? Constable Ram Singh and I were on duty. We saw the suspect come out of Dhaniram's house... by a pipe, in a hurry. When he came down, we arrested him. His hands were covered in blood. What time was it when you arrested the suspect? - 11:55. - Thank you. With your permission, your honor... please read the police surgeon's report. The part where the murder time is mentioned. By examining the body and the wounds on the body... It can be said the murder took place between 11:30 and 12:00. And your honor, sub-lnspector Das arrested the suspect at 11:55. Sub-lnspector Das, what did you do... after arresting the suspect? We took him inside the house. We found Dhaniram dead there. A knife in the stomach of the victim. And the suspect's fingerprints were on the knife. And his footprints on the spilled milk. Which was also examined later on. So, members of the jury... this is the real account of the murder. After listening, it seems... the murder took place right before our eyes. It's not that difficult to join the missing links. The suspect went inside. Dhaniram was sleeping. He woke up and tried to catch the suspect. During the fight, the glass of milk on the table fell down. When he couldn't free himself... the suspect took a knife and stabbed him in the stomach. And Dhaniram died on the spot. Seeing this, he left the knife in his stomach... and left the house in a hurry... with the help of the pipe. As for happened after that, you know already. After Sub-lnspector Das's testimony... I don't think there's any need... for any argument or evidence. I end my statement here your honor. Your witness please. Sub-lnspector Das, you've said in your testimony... that you saw Kaalia descending the pipe in a hurry. Why didn't you just say 'descending'? What did you mean by 'in a hurry'? In a hurry means in a hurry. You said that, when you arrested Kaalia... - at that time it was 11:55. - Yes. How did you know the time? By looking at my watch. Are you wearing the same watch now? - Yes. - Tell me the time. 3:55. If it's not too much trouble, look at the clock in the courtroom. - 4:08. - Thank you. This is absurd, your honor. The lawyer friend is using cunning to confuse the members of the jury. He wants to wrongly make an issue of the time of murder. You made the time of murder an issue, not I. Inspector Das's testimony has. Your honor and member of the jury... according the police surgeon's report... the murder took place between 11:30 and 12:00. If 11:30 and 12:00 are the two limits... then the mid-time is 11:45. We can take the time of murder to be 11:45. Inspector Das arrested Kaalia at 11:55... but actually, it wasn't 11:55 at all. It was really 12:08. Your honor and members of the jury... no stolen goods were found on Kaalia. And no evidence was found that he tried to steal anything. A man in a hurry... a man caught coming out of a house in a hurry... a man who hadn't even stolen anything... was sitting near a dead body comfortably for 23 minutes? It's impossible. After murdering him, his hands were covered with fresh blood! Even that's impossible. Mr. Kailash, the case is not about if... the murder took place 23 minutes earlier or later. The murder was committed and who is the murderer. Murderer. Inspector Das... what did you do after arresting the suspect? We took him inside Dhaniram's house. How long did it take to go up with the help of the pipe? We, we didn't go up through the pipe. Oh, so you broke down the door? What, break down the door? No, the door was open. - The door was open? - Yes. So, you're telling us... the man who was near the dead body for 23 minutes... came out through the pipe and not the open door? And in a hurry, to boot? And you expect us to believe that? It's 100 percent correct, your honor. It's possible he didn't see the open door. It's possible. But your honor, I want to know why the door was open so late at night. Maybe, maybe Dhaniram was awake. My lawyer friend is forgetting... a while ago he said when the suspect entered his house... Dhaniram was sleeping. Tell me something. Was Dhaniram asleep or awake? I won't be confused by you. Your honor, Dhaniram was awake. Your honor, Dhaniram was awake and the lights were switched off. Dhaniram was a miser... but he couldn't see in the dark, like a cat. Dhaniram was awake in the dark. How strange is that? Your honor, the suspect must have turned off the light when leaving. Inspector Dass, if someone's hands are covered in blood and he turns off a light... and there are no stains on it, is it possible? Tell me the truth. It's a question of an innocent man's life. There will be bloodstains. - Were there bloodstains on it? - No. - Thank you. You may go. - Thank you. Respected members of the jury... the question remains unanswered. Why was the door open? I'll try and answer it. Imagine Dhaniram after finishing his everyday work... going to turn off the lights. Suddenly there's a knock at the door. He goes to the door, and looks through the peephole. There's a known person standing outside. Dhaniram opens the door. The person has worn gloves. They have an argument over something. The other person stabs him in the stomach. He switches off the light and then leaves silently. Dhaniram's dead body is lying there. He didn't get up to close the door. Time passes. There's a slight change in the situation. Another character comes in. His name is Kaalia. Kaalia is a petty thief. He's also ill. Your honor, one who is dying himself, how can he kill others? He sees that Dhaniram's house window is open. He climbs in, with help from the pipe. He enters the house. It's dark inside. He steps in the spilled milk. He slips. He falls near the dead body. And his bad luck places his hand on the knife. His fingerprints are transferred onto the knife. He gets scared, seeing the blood. He runs to the window and hurries down the same way he entered. And after that, and after that your honor... innocent Kaalia is made to stand before you like a criminal. Mr. Kailash, that's a very nice story. Thank you for the praise, your honor. But there is some reality in every story your honor. But where's the truth in this story? There is just the truth and only the truth, your honor. It's not a story. So Mr. Kailash, are we to conclude... from your statement that someone saw the murder with his own eyes? That's what I'm trying to convince the court, your honor. That there was surely someone there... who either committed the murder... or witnessed the murder with his own eyes. - The evidence? - This is the evidence, your honor. These are the two glasses found in the victim's home. On one there's Dhaniram's fingerprints. On the other is someone else's. Who is this other man? Where is he? Why hasn't he been brought forward yet? It's possible he's the murderer. Or maybe he knows something about the murderer. In the name of the law, I appeal to the law. I call to the innocent, that man should be presented to the court. If you can't find him anywhere... then he must be caught! Your Honor, he's destroyed the evidence. Note this point, your honor. My lawyer friend thinks these glasses are evidence. And that I'm also claiming these glasses are important evidence. Then why were they neglected before now? And you broke those glasses. I want to give some good news to my friend. These glasses are fake. The real glasses are in the custody of the court. Very nice Mr. Kailash, very nice. Wow. Mr. Kailash, wow. We had fun. Judge sir has really trained you well. You'll surely live up to his name. Wow! Great! - Wow, Kailash. - Great Kailash. Wow! Wow! Whose fingerprints were on the glasses? Mine. What are you trying to prove? That I was present during the murder. Do you know the consequences? I can be accused of the murder. Has someone pointed a finger at you? No. Why do you want to tighten the noose around your own neck? To save an innocent man. - Is there no other way? - No. - Do one more thing. - What? - Give me poison. - Meena! Am I not a human being? Am I a stone? Why should I keep quiet? You're sacrificing our love for a dying man. I ask you why? I believe in him, that's why. You put the noose around your neck... and I'll strangle myself. It's because your heart says so. You don't care about my heart. Stop the car. Now, you do what your heart says and I'll do what mine says. Well done. Does it hurt? When an animal is sacrificed to some God... they first feed him and make him strong. And that's what you're also doing, doctor sir. Breath in. Heavily. Open your mouth and breath in. Now, there are still two meetings left with you. One with me and one with my dead body. You'll call me for an examination before hanging me. You'll say he's alive. And after that they'll hang me. Then they'll ask you if I'm dead or alive. You'll say I'm dead. Then your treatment will end. Turn that side, well done. Oh God. The rituals of this world are really strange. When I was out of jail... I used to beg from everyone. I'd tell them to please save me as I was very poor. But no one listened to me. Now I'm about to die, even today. I beg before everyone to please let me be ill. Don't treat me with your medicine. If I get better, then I'll want to live. I won't die easily. If I starve myself then I'll die easily. But even today no one listens to me. Sit up. Hail Ram. Just as the law is deaf and dumb... so are you. Won't you answer any of my questions? Tell me why you're treating me. So that I don't die early? You're not trying to treat me. You're trying to keep me alive until they hang me. If I die early, then Justice will be insulted. Then justice will be incomplete. The law won't be satisfied. But you have only two answers. He's alive. He's dead. Don't be scared. Have faith in God. You're right. The Lord is the only support of the weak. Here no one will answer my questions. Now that I'm about to go to him, I'll ask him. Tell me, who is responsible for my death? The law, or you? Kaalia, someone has come to see you. All my relatives are dead. Now who has risen from the dead? Some girl has come. - Girl? - Yes. - For me. - Yes, yes. Why are you joking with me? I'm telling you she's come to meet you. Come, I'll solve your misunderstanding. Madam, they are mistaken that you've come to see me. They're right. I have come to meet you. With me? Yes. I'm a very useless man. What business could you have with me? I've come to ask you something. Do ask. Take a seat. Tell me the truth. Did you kill Dhaniram? No madam, I didn't kill Dhaniram. The Lord knows I'm not a murderer. The one who is dying himself... how can he kill someone else? Yes, I do steal. Madam you tell me. ls the punishment for stealing a death sentence? Why do you steal? Steal? It's a very long story. I used to love my wife a lot. She passed away suddenly. And she left a small child after her. After her death I fell ill... from the shock of her death. I became useless. No one even offered me any work. Then I started stealing to keep the child alive. He is the only memory of my wife. Where is your child? I got him admitted to a school. He also lives there. I don't want him to be influenced by me. He doesn't even know I'm his father. When he was small, I used to steal to feed him. And now I steal to educate him. Do you want your son to become a respected man? Which father doesn't want that? His mother used to say that when my son grows up... he'll become a commissioner, a governor. That poor soul died with that dream in her eyes. Even I will die with the same dreams in my eyes. - Why do you think like that? - What else can I think of, madam? He has no one in this world except for me. If I die, then who will pay his school fees? Who will pay his other expenses? This world is very cruel, madam. They don't even give death if you ask. So how can someone feed him? Who knows what will happen to him? If someone adopts your son? That would make me very happy.. What else could I want? I will die happily. I'll tighten the noose around my neck myself. But why would anyone adopt him. Dreams are never fulfilled. Now there is only one hope. My lawyer. I feel as if he'll surely save me. He won't let my son become an orphan. Kailash sir is really a God. Madam, he is really a God. I'm sorry, your honor. Yes, your honor. Did you find the man whose fingerprints were on the glass? No, your honor. And it's not possible to find him now. The police records include only the fingerprints of criminals. This man doesn't have any record there. And your honor, many people used to come and go... from Dhaniram's house. We can't catch everyone. I agree. Mr. Kailash, we should carry on with the court proceedings. It's impossible to find that man. It's possible, your honor. How? Truth is stranger than fiction. Your honor, a little while ago I received this letter. It looks like an ordinary paper. But it's actually a very important document. This letter was sent by the man for whom the court is searching. And as evidenc, he he has also sent his fingerprints, your honor. First you should see this. Are they the same fingerprints found on the glass of milk? Give it to Mr. Kazmi for examination. Yes, Mr. Kazmi. The prints belong to the same person, your honor. Now your honor, with the permission of the court I'd like to read the letter... sent along with this letter. 'I'm the same man the court is looking for.' 'I know Dhaniram's killer very well.' 'At this time when this letter is being read...' 'I'm present in the courtroom.' The murderer is also present right now in the courtroom. What is he saying? 'I appeal for the last time to his soul.' I give his soul the oath of truth humanity and justice! 'That he should come in front and admit his crimes.' 'I give him only 5 minutes!' 'If he doesn't admit his crime within these 5 minutes...' 'then I'll be forced to point the finger at him.' 'I'll be forced to say, "He is the murderer. Arrest him!"' Did the letter end? Yes, your honor. Seems like someone has tried to play a prank on the court. Your honor, first of all, I don't think this is a prank. And even if it is a prank, then... the court won't lose anything in 5 minutes. It is possible that these 5 minutes... can be very valuable for justice. If that's what you want then... the court proceedings are stopped for 5 minutes. Your honor... If you leave, the culprit might run away. Until the 5 minutes are over... everyone here is suspect. No one should be allowed to leave. I request of you the same thing. Sir, what will that man who wrote the letter tell you? I'll tell you who the murderer is. Lawyer sir, thank you very much. All you did for me, that I can never forget. Everyone values his life. That's why I kept lying before now. But now I cannot lie anymore. This life has been ruined. Why should I ruin my next life? And I know I'm going to the heavenly abode. Why should I lie? Judge sir, all the respected persons... I ask for forgiveness. The public prosecutor was right. I went to rob Dhaniram's house. He woke up. I didn't pull out my knife... to kill him but only to scare him, sir. I did like this and accidentally stabbed him. And he died, he died on the spot, your honor. I swear by God, I murdered him. Now, whether you hang me or throw me in jail... I won't lie, your honor. I won't lie. Tell me, why did you lie in the courtroom today? Why are you accepting someone else's crime? Why? I killed Dhaniram, lawyer sir. You're lying again! The court may believe this lie. But not me. I don't understand why you did that. How did this idea come to your mind? You weren't a criminal before now, but now you'll be one. You're killing yourself. You're committing suicide. Who needs my life anyway? Justice does, you and I do, too. To save you, I risked my love. I risked my profession. I sacrificed my peace, my comfort, everything. Because of you, I didn't even care about death. And you betrayed me. I give you the oath of the child because... of whom you're alive until now. Tell me. Why did you do that? Why? Don't give me his oath, lawyer sir. I was alive until now for him. And I'm also dying for him now. A woman came. She told me... if I accepted this crime, she'd take care of my child. Who was that woman? I don't know her name. But she looks like a Goddess. She has taken all the responsibilities of my child. His education, living, feeding everything. She deposited 10,000 rupees... in the bank in the name of my child, lawyer sir. Now my child won't become a thief like me. He'll become a lawyer like you... a judge, a respected man. God, you are very kind. Thanks a lot, God! Members of the jury, you've heard all sides of the case. And along with that... you've also heard that Kaalia has confessed to his crimes. Now you may go for the discussion. Your honor! I would like to say something. You want to say something even after the suspect has confessed? Yes, your honor. I want to say the suspect was forced to confess his crimes. But he's confessed before the court. He also confessed before the court that he's not the murderer. Did the court accept his testimony? If his earlier testimony was wrong... then why was the second testimony right? Is it because the second testimony is what the court wanted to hear? Mr. Kailash, you're insulting the court. Speaking the truth isn't insulting the court, your honor. The courts are created for justice. And justice is served on the basis of truth. Your honor, the man whose fingerprints were found on the glass. That man is me! The murder was committed in my presence. I know who the murderer is! Mr. Kailash, if you knew, why did you keep quiet until now? Why didn't you say something already? I didn't open my mouth because my emotions forbid me from doing so. Even my soul was afraid to take the name of the real murderer. That's why I tried to save innocent Kaalia. But today! Today I cannot keep quiet! I cannot let an innocent man die! My soul is telling me to say what I saw! Mr. Badri Prasad, you are the murderer! I saw you murder Dhaniram. You have no right to sit on this seat of justice. Quiet! This is outrageous, Mr. Kailash. You can't insult anyone sitting in this chair. Come to my chambers this moment. I won't keep quiet now. No, I will not! I was quiet till now, and so the law got... a chance to frame an innocent man. I was quiet till now, so the lie got... a chance to become the truth. I hid this secret in the depths of my heart... because of my love. But today, I cannot even face myself. Every criminal should be punished for his crimes. Every innocent man should be proven innocent! That is the decision of truth and justice. And I'll keep fighting for it until the end! Even if I have to give my life for it! Silence! 'Why are you afraid? Place a bet, murder someone, and don't get caught.' 'Okay, then you have a bet, but you'll lose.' A bet? Case number 55311! The State versus Kaalia! Mister prosecutor, do you want to present more arguments? No, your honor. But I would like to say, that my able friend... still hasn't been able to prove Kaalia innocent... after his many attempts. The suspect has confessed to his crimes... and after that all this seems a pointless drama. Your honor, the very sad point of this case is that... he has accused such an innocent... and respected man that took care of him... educated him, made him a human being, and brought him to this stature. It will be better if you don't bring... family matters into legal arguments. Okay, your honor. The glass that was found in the victim Dhaniram's house... had on it the fingerprints of Mr. Kailash... and proves Mr. Kailash went to victim Dhaniram's house. But it doesn't prove he was there at the time of the murder. And the second thing is, your honor... until today, no murder has taken place in this manner. Behind every murder there is a reason... a motive or a profit or loss. Mr. Badri Prasad could have killed Dhaniram... but there's no reason for him doing so And someone else could have killed Dhaniram, besides Kaalia. I'm not prepared to believe that. Mr. Kailash, would you like to say something? Your honor, as far as Mr. Badri Prasad is concerned. I could become a good man, a good friend and a good son. But I understand there's no relation between justice and emotion. I have learned from Mr. Badri Prasad to always speak the truth. Kaalia is innocent. I would like to present two witnesses to prove my point. My first witness is Mr. Vijay Prasad. Mr. Vijay Prasad. Mr. Vijay Prasad! Summon in the court. Mr. Vijay Prasad! In the presence of God say you will speak the truth and nothing but the truth. - Yes, okay correct. - You must say it exactly. - What? - Repeat it. Should I read what is written on this? In the presence of God, I solemnly declare that... I will speak only the truth and nothing but the truth. So help me God. Your name? That's strange. You don't know my name? Tell me your name. Mr. Vijay Prasad. You father's name? Mr. Vijay Prasad, I asked your father's name. Mr. Badri Prasad. What do you do? - I attend college. - Student? - No. - Then you're a professor? - No. Then why go to college? I just go. I'll tell you. Mr. Vijay Prasad, you're a spoiled brat. - You go there to flirt with the girls. - Kailash. You go to the movies, picnics and clubs along with them. - Kailash. - You lie to them. - You spend a lot of money on them. - Correct. - You splurge on them - Kailash, listen to me. - When you can't borrow money from your father, you deceive your sister. When you can't get from your sister you take out a loan. And this habit of borrowing money, took you to Dhaniram's house. Tell me clearly. Did you go to Dhaniram's house to borrow money or not? Who's Dhaniram? - Very nice. So you don't know Dhaniram? - No. - You don't even recognise him? - No. - And you're telling the truth. - Absolutely. You don't know him and don't recognise him and you're telling the truth? Yes, I don't know him and don't recognise him and I'm telling the truth. Recognise this paper? Which? No, no impossible. No. - Is this your signature or someone else's? - Not mine. Mr. Vijay Prasad, this is the same blank paper... - you gave to Dhaniram. - Absolutely not. If you still refuse to identify it I'll call a handwriting expert. - Your honor... - No listen, why are you calling him? Give me the paper. This, this is my handwriting. I used to go to Dhaniram to borrow money. I used to go. - Wait! - Yes. The day Dhaniram was murdered... did you go to borrow money? Because I needed it. Over the previous year you paid back neither the principal nor the interest. - How could I? - As a result, you owed him 7,000 rupees? - Correct. - And that day when you went to ask... for more money he threatened you. - Yes he did. - He said that if you didn't return... his money by the next day, he'd take over all your father's... - properties with the help of this paper. - And the next day he was killed. Answer the question! I'm not joking, tell me. What did you do after his threat? I went to my sister. - For help? - Yes. Why didn't you go to your father? If I went to him, he'd have killed me. Your honor and members of the jury please note this. A father who might kill his own son over 7,000 rupees... could do many things to a moneylender... about to take over his property with the help of this paper... who was about to plunder all his life's earnings. Saying he would have killed me doesn't mean he'd literally kill me. - What did you mean, then? - You... you're a liar, a cunning man. Order, order. - Mr. Vijay Prasad. - Yes. - Thank you, you may go. - Okay. I'll see... Ms. Meena, do you know this man? Look at him carefully. Try and recognise him. This is the man who confessed to being Dhaniram's murderer. I say this man is lying. He made this confession because of coercion or fear. He's been bought, your honor, and you bought him - Kailash! - You played with his emotions... and promised to look after his child after his death. Miss Meena, think and say if that's true or not. This is a lie, absolutely a lie. Look, you have taken an oath to speak only the truth. Speak only the truth in the presence of God. This is a question of an innocent man's life. I said it's a lie, absolutely a lie. Is this a lie? Do you recognise this receipt? Kailash. You honor, this is the receipt... for the 10,000 rupees deposited in the bank for Kaalia's child. This isn't just a receipt for 10,000 rupees, your honor, but Kaalia's death sentence. - No, Kailash! - It's the evidence of your shamelessness. - Kailash! - This isn't a receipt for 10,000, your honor... - but the mirror of your heart. - Kailash! - I want to know the name of the man who's been brought? - Kailash! Who's the man, whose noose has been given to him? I don't know anything. I don't know anything. I don't know anything. Light, in Dhanirams house? Silence! Mr. Badri Prasad, do you confess to your crimes? No. Do you have a lawyer to represent you? Your honor, as you know, I'm an able lawyer myself. Then will you defend your case yourself? If the court grants me permission. - Permission granted. - Thank you, your honor. Your honor, my first and last witness is Mr. Kailash. I request the court that Mr. Kailash be called to the witness stand. Mr. Kailash. In the presence of God, I solemnly declare that... I will speak only the truth and nothing but the truth. Mr. Kailash... your testimony was that you were present when Dhaniram was killed. Yes. Where were you at the time of the murder? I mean, where in the house? In the adjoining room. That means you let the murderer do his work. He didn't know I was there. Why did you go there? I've already shown that your daughter sent me there. - For the paper that had Vijay's signature on it? - Yes. And Dhaniram readily handed over that paper to you? - In the beginning he... Answer yes or no. Did you get that paper? Yes I did. Your honor and members of the jury... the whole city knew Dhaniram. He created many paupers, ruined many families... and many committed suicide because of him. If Dhaniram ever got his grip on something... then no one could ever take it from him. A man like that had a paper by which he could... have taken over someone's property worth lakhs. And Dhaniram hands that paper over to him easily. Isn't that strange? But that's the truth. That's not the truth, Mr. Kailash. I'll tell you the truth. The night of June 30, at 11:30... Dhaniram is about to go to sleep after putting away his account books... when there's a knock on the door. Dhaniram is astounded. He carefully goes to the door. He looks through the peephole. A young man is standing outside. Dhaniram knows that young man. He opens the door and the young man comes in. Dhaniram also treats him. He offers him a glass of sherbet. The young man drinks the sherbet. Dhaniram asks him why he took the trouble of coming so late. The young man explains the reason. He asks him politely if he has a blank paper... with Vijay's signature on it. If so, then return it and he'll pay the amount himself. If he doesn't have it, why trouble him unnecessarily? Then Dhaniram says he's not troubling him unnecessarily. He smiles, Dhaniram takes a paper from his safe... and shows it to the young man. In the next moment, Dhaniram's smile vanishes as the young man has a knife. He stabs Dhaniram in the stomach. Dhaniram dies on the spot. The young man keeps the paper. He wipes his fingerprints from the knife using a handkerchief. He turns out the light using the same handkerchief... and then quietly goes home. No one knows anything. But, he forgets he left his fingerprints on the glass. The prints that can bring him to the court! The prints that can tighten the noose around his neck! That's why he makes up a story. He creates a drama. To make himself the hero, he creates a sensation in the court. And the truth is lost somewhere in all that. Mr. Kailash, the truth is that you're the murderer. You murdered Dhaniram. That's a lie. What could be my motive to kill him? Your honor, the motive is love... and the evidence is that girl crying there. She knows that you're the murderer. To save you, she takes 10,000 rupees from her father... and buys Kaalia. But you don't know that murder is itself a noose... that tightens itself around the neck of the murderer... and brings him before the court. This can be easily proven wrong. Your honor the noose had already tightened around Kaalia's neck. What was the need for me to speak? I could have stayed quiet. But I did exactly the opposite. Why did I do that? So I could save an innocent man. And besides that, I can prove... Mr. Badri Prasad had already killed someone. Your honor, please grant me permission to walk to my seat. - Granted. - Thank you, sir. Please read the diary entry of the 28th of June. 'The human mind is very strange.' 'After that argument in the chamber...' 'and the bet with Mr. Jha...' 'I feel like I should be murdering someone.' After reading this diary your honor... we know that the wish to murder had developed. The only thing remaining was the right time and chance. And in the end, his son Vijay gave him that chance. Mr. Badri Prasad, is this diary yours? Yes. This diary is mine and so is the writing. Your honor, every man thinks of committing a crime sometime. But not everyone fulfills it. The development of a wish in my heart to kill someone doesn't prove I did it. - You murdered him. - What evidence do you have? Whether there is an evidence or not, I saw you kill Dhaniram. I have! I have! Why don't you confess to your crimes? Why don't you tell the truth? You taught me to tell the truth. Look, I'm ready to sacrifice everything for the truth. I've put my love, my happiness, my profession at stake for the truth! There's no more reason for me to live now. There's no goal! My life has become empty. I wish, I wish I could give my life for your crimes. - Kailash come to me. I... - Mr. Badri Prasad, you know the law. - This is against the rules. - I am sorry, your honor. May I go to Kailash? Granted. Look at me, Kailash. Put your hand on my head. And swear you saw me murder Dhaniram. This is my misfortune, papa. That I saw you kill Dhaniram. Your honor... I don't have anything else to say in my defense. Members of the jury, you've heard all the arguments. Now you all have to make a decision. Remember this, you have been given... this responsibility as respected and responsible citizens. Who the suspect is, if wealthy or not... if influential or not, shouldn't affect your decision. If you have difficulty making the decision, or need my help, then I am here. Listen to me once more. You will do this work responsibly. Your decision shouldn't be based on anything not discussed here in court. I solemnly swear, that from this time... I take all the jury members under my custody... until they reach a decision. I won't talk to them. Nor will I permit anyone else to speak to them Papa! Silence! - Mr. Foremen. - Your honor. Has the jury made a decision? Yes, your honor. Is the jury unanimous? No, your honor. What is the decision? 5 are in the majority and 4 are not. What is the opinion of the majority? The majority finds Mr. Badri Prasad to be the murderer. I'm sorry for the interruption, your honor. Something new has come up regarding this case. I'd like to bring it to the court's attention. What? At this stage? You should know requests like that after the jury's decision... are against the rules of the court. I've never seen anyone on the bench or the bar... making rquests like this. - You can't get permission for that. - Your honor... the court is created to dispense truth and justice. I know the request I'm making isn't timely. But in a case where it's a question of life or death... a request that affects the decision... should surely be brought to the attention of the court. I don't entirely agree with that opinion. Even so, in the name of truth and justice... I give you permission to present it to the court. Thank you, your honor. What's all this? Why has this dead body been brought into the court? Please forgive me, your honor. But under the current situation there could... have been no other testimony better than his. Your honor, some days back you must have read about... the burglary at the late Dhaniram's house. You must have also read that after robbing Dhaniram's house... that man fled in Mr. Kailash's car. The police chased him and the man's car went into the sea with him inside. This dead body belongs to that man, your honor. What's the connection to this case? Your honor, this man confessed before dying... that he was the real murderer of Dhaniram. And the reason for that is this woman. This is a lie and an insult, your honor! I saw Badri Prasad killing Dhaniram with my own eyes! - Then see him also with the same eyes. - No! In the history of law, this case will always be considered strange. The man Mr. Kailash saw murdering Dhaniram wasn't Badri Prasad. It was this man whose dead body is lying here. I deeply regret that because of this case... Mr. Badri Prasad has had to face many difficulties. And now the court finds him not guilty. And ends this case. It hasn't ended, your honor. It's just started. Only one murder case is finished. There are many cases that are about to come. I'd like to say something regarding that. Please do. I'd want that myself. I only want to know... if the real suspect wasn't found, it'd have been my death. If Kailash's soul hadn't awakened it would mean Kaalia's death. Who would have been named... who would have been responsible for the death of these innocent men? The law. But the law only sees what it's shown. The law isn't out to arrest anyone. Whoever is brought before it is thought to be the suspect. Justice lies in the hands of the witness. Because the law gives justice only on the basis of testimony. And today all of you have seen how a witness... might be wrong because of the confusion of a situation. According to me, Kailash is a man who can be presented as an example. We can swear to his honesty. While he remained silent then innocent Kaalia's life was in danger. And when he broke his silence, then another innocent, Badri Prasad... began counting his last minutes. Your honor, I am even proud of my daughter. She's educated, smart, intelligent. She's a judge's daughter. She knows the law. But when her emotions got in the way... she kept quiet. And when she broke her silence, then she told a lie. If such educated and intelligent people are helpless against the situation... then what can an ordinary man do? Then should there be no testimony? There should be. But the law shouldn't forget a human being, after all, is a human being... and not a God. Sometimes his eyes are deceived... and sometimes his heart is. The human being is tied up in many emotional relations at every step. And at every step he becomes helpless because of these relations. In a situation where human beings are helpless at every step... then does the law have any right to take the life of another man? Does the law have the right... to take away something as valuable as a life... on the basis of coincidence? Does the law have the right to steal something it can't return? I say this right belongs only to the one that gives life. Neither human beings nor the law have this right. A life for a life. This isn't justice. It's revenge! Your honor, I appeal to you, to everyone here, to the whole country. I appeal to all the people living in this world! Stop playing with human lives. The death sentence should be banned forever... and it should be deleted from the law books. The human hearts should be afraid of Him rather than of death. Order! Order! Order! Kailash. Papa, I didn't know the eyes could be deceived. Please forgive me. You've done nothing for which you need to ask forgiveness. What you've done, maybe no one else could have done it. I admire your courage, Kailash. I'm proud of you. Meena, I think that Kailash should be rewarded. What do you think? No? Come on.
