♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ Did you guys hang out last night? Yeah, dude, you should have been with us. We took a whole six pack from Dylan's dad. It was my idea. No way, did you guys like, get drunk and stuff? I don't remember a thing. I blacked right out. You only had a sip, you loser. Dyl Pickle got scared. Don't call me that, Lyle. ♫ Rebecca, be careful. ♫ So we're gonna get like a 12 pack this time. I had to be the lookout. Can't drink when I'm on the job. Like your dad's gonna wake up? Bell rang, boys. Whatever, Mr. Howard. It's just all a joke to you guys, huh? Lets see how funny these test scores are. ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ Honey, jump off. Dylan, please get back in your seat. Dylan? Dylan, you okay? Dylan! Is he okay, Mr. Howard? Dylan, buddy. What's wrong with him, bro? Dylan, wake up, hey, Dylan. Oh, my God, Rebecca? Rebecca, wake up! Rebecca, honey, please wake up! ♫ ♫ ♫ Dylan, my man. You gotta get yourself some new porn. Want a beer? I'm on the clock. Where you been? Out. Crazy boy. You clean the spark plugs of that four by with your goddamn tongue, but you can't sweep up in here every once in a while? The only one who comes around is you. Then you should make an effort. Where you been? Car wash. Got an extra shift. Bullshit. Call 'em. Think I won't? Think you should. Have you been associating with any known criminals? No, Sir, I have not. Have you crossed over the state line at any time? No, Sir, have not. How's the job going? It's boring, but it's still mine. Two months. Gotta be some kind of record. Anything else you need to know? I need to know when you're gonna slip up and stick your pecker in the grits again. This may be a dumb question, but what did I ever do to you? You went into other people's houses and took things that didn't belong to you, things that they worked long and hard for. And I paid my debt, Giddons. My conscience is shiny and new. Yeah, well, how about Bo and Lyle? Bo and Lyle weren't on that job. So the record states. That is real sweet of you to take the heat for your old school buddies. Giddons, all due respect, you're not a detective, you're my PO. And I know that you ride me more than most. Why? You're smart. And ain't nothing in this world dumber than a smart guy. A smart man, he sees beyond his little world and it kind of warps him. So when he makes that wrong move, and you will, it tends to be messy. Well, maybe there's a side of me you don't see. As long as you're on parole you are only what I see. Now, I'd lock the doors if I was you. There's burglars and thieves around these parts. ♫ ♫ ♫ I bet you thought I wasn't gonna make it. Yeah, I wasn't sure that I was. Oh, that's right, you've only had 12 hours to change. You should have started last night. "Ha-ha" she said gamely. Well, two of our trustees are gonna be at the Thompsons'. Do I have to be charming? No, just be yourself. Actually, you need to be a little charming. Just nod and smile and talk to the wives. It's the Thompsons, Dorothy will be there, you can gossip behind our backs. I promise to turn my back as often as possible. Is that what you're wearing? ♫ Woo! Let's go double or nothing. I'll spot you three balls this time. All tapped out, buddy. Come on man, don't be a pussy. I know you got some green right there in that pocket. No, I'm good. Hey. You walk out on a man who's still gambling you might catch a bad one, boy. You starting fights again, Dyl? What's up? Why don't you rack 'em up, big guy? I'd be happy to take Dyl's cash off you. Come on, man. Lemme buy you a beer. So what you been working on, man? Dirty cars, mostly. Yeah? That sounds shitty. Better work's coming. A lot of businesses going belly up in this economy. Ready? Tons of shit just sitting there just waiting to be picked. I know you could use the money. Especially if you ever wanna play pool again. Not exactly flush. Well, hell, let's change that. Hey, can I get a beer here for my poor relation? I'll be seeing you. You know, Giddons finds out that you and Bo have been chatting he's gonna send you right back up. He probably will anyway. Fourteen in the corner. With authority. Porters. Hi. Hi, how are you? Fine, how are you? ♫ Personally I think you're a shoo-in. I don't know, guys. The city council would be a good step, but I still have a hospital to run, you know? I'm not sure I'm ready to move on. Methinks the man doth protest too much. Not at all. You still got four months of protesting ahead of him. Wait until we start begging before you announce. Please don't ever... ...a rumor, sweetie. It's an undeniable truth, it might as well be written in print. What's truth? Chief Booth is having a thing, he's taking lovers. Paula Dodd. Paula Dodd? Is she that, she that... Yeah, she runs that gift shop, sells those ceramic things. Oh, yes thank you. She's good. What did you tell Audrey Booth? Oh, she was absolutely crucified. But she has a right to know if her husband cheated on her, that's all I'm saying. Hey, Dylan. Hey, Donna. Gonna buy me a drink? I uh, damn. All cleaned out right now. I mean, I would. You can have mine. Oh, that's okay. I don't want your cooties. No, no, no, I've been to a specialist about that and they turned out to be benign cooties. So... Wait, what? Nothing, it's just a... So what's been going on with you? Oh, just, you know, the usual. Hey, you working? Yeah, yeah I'm over at the uh National Car Wash still. That's cool. Yeah. Okay. I was, okay, let's just talk later. Yeah, I'll see you around. All right. Okay. Good talking to you. Hey, Eddie. Look what the horse dragged in. Oh, yeah! ♫ No, it's the best thing in the world, really. I only took the class because Dorothy was taking it... And for the naked men. And for the naked men, of course, but now it's really an obsession. The drawing, I mean. What about you, Becky? Do you ever think about taking classes? Oh, I meant to take a painting class for a while, but I'm really no good. Well you're not out to make a living, sweetie. Drawing will be good for you, it clears out the cobwebs, not that you have got any cobwebs... Oh, my God. I had a streak, boy! You walked away when I was on a streak! I had a streak! Boys, keep it light, now! Outside, come on! You all right? Man, I didn't even see him coming. Well, he knocked the living piss out of you, man. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Well let me pull you a beer on the house, how about it? I'll pass, Wayne, thanks. ♫ Rebecca. Is she okay? I'm sorry, sorry, I'm fine. Oh, my God. Hit him, yeah, hit him again. You made your point, guys. You're welcome. ♫ ♫ Give me a little warning next time you're gonna have another seizure, okay? I mean, honey, really, it was quite a show. It was a muscle spasm. I guess. It hurt a lot. For a second I... felt like somebody hit me. The look on your face, Becky. It was a little much, you know? Even for someone with a muscle spasm. I just, I guess for a second I was worried this was the beginning of another... It's not. It's not. Okay. I'll give you a shoulder rub when we get home. It doesn't hurt anymore. ♫ ♫ In the days ♫ ♫ We will live ♫ ♫ Like our ghosts will live ♫ ♫ Pitching glass ♫ ♫ At the cornfield crows ♫ ♫ And folding clothes ♫ ♫ And we'll undress beside the ashes ♫ ♫ Of the fire ♫ ♫ Both our tender bellies bound in baling wire ♫ ♫ ♫ All the more a pair of underwater pearls ♫ ♫ ♫ Than the oak tree and its resurrection fern ♫ ♫ ♫ We'll undress beside ♫ ♫ the ashes of the fire ♫ ♫ Our tender bellies all wound around ♫ ♫ In baling wire ♫ ♫ All the more a pair of underwater pearls ♫ ♫ ♫ Than the oak tree and its resurrection fern ♫ ♫ ♫ Hello? Where are you at...? What, what time is it? Oh, shit! ♫ When we were younger we thought ♫ Oh, shit! ♫ Then we grew a little ♫ ♫ And romanticized the time I saw ♫ ♫ Flowers in your hair ♫ ♫ It takes a boy to live ♫ ♫ It takes a man to pretend he was there ♫ ♫ ♫ Be in my eyes ♫ ♫ Be in my heart ♫ ♫ Be in my eyes ai yai yai ♫ ♫ Be in my heart ♫ ♫ ♫ So now I think that I could ♫ ♫ Love you back ♫ ♫ And I hope it's not too late ♫ ♫ 'Cause you're so attractive ♫ ♫ And the way you move ♫ ♫ I won't close my eyes ♫ ♫ So be in my eyes ♫ ♫ Be in my heart ♫ Hello. Hi. Anything in particular? No, I'm just stocking up. ♫ Be in my eyes ♫ ♫ Be in my heart ♫ ♫ Got me on a Monday ♫ ♫ It's just me feeling bad ♫ ♫ ♫ Look out! Fuck! Fuck. What? - What? - What? Who is that? Who said that? Stop it. Ma'am? Who said that? Stop this! Stop this, stop it. Ma'am, your bag. Uh-oh. Oh, shit. Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it. What is this, what's going on? Stop it, stop this... Hey, shut up! Can you hear me? Who are you? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, what am I sorry about, what did I do? Who are you? I asked you that. I'm looking at a store window. Am I looking at a store window? Yes, I am. Are you me? No, no, no, you're in my head. You're in my head. I'm having... I'm losing... Oh, God, I'm so scared. Where am I? What? Where am I? Uh, you're on the road, you're on a road. There's a truck, I don't understand, what does the truck mean? Well that means I have a truck. It's my truck. I have a truck. You have a truck. Yeah. Why, what do you have? What? Oh, um, a Range Rover. Nice, safe. I can see out there. I can see here, too. It's like one's close and one's far away. I just focus and I can see what's here or what's in my head. This ain't your head, lady, this is New Mexico. Wait, you're real. You're a real person. Oh, that's the sweetest thing anybody said to me all day. I don't understand this. It's cold. Wait are you, are you cold there? Yeah, it's um, it's almost winter. I can feel it. Oh, this is too crazy. And I can hear you... Like I hear myself. Where are you? If you're not in my head then where are you? Exeter, New Hampshire. New Hampshire? Get outta here. Wait a minute, what time is it? No, what day? Um, it's Thursday the uh, 24th? Okay, well that's today, I think. Do you have a watch? Yeah. Oh, my God. You're in the future. You're two hours in the future! No. I'm in a different time zone. Oh, yeah, right. Can you hear my thoughts? I don't know, think something. Okay. What should I think about? I'm not allowed to tell you. Right. Okay. Yeah, no, I got nothing. I'm thinking about new sneakers. Okay. That's a weird one. Uh, all right, well, hey, what if we just both... Rebecca, are you all right? Hello? You there? Hi. Chief Booth. You okay? Yes. I'm fine. I'm so sorry, I think I fell, I think I'm... Did you hurt yourself? No, I think maybe I had bad clams or something. Um, are you, how are you, how's Audrey? Good, she's great. Are you sure you're all right? Yeah, I'm great, I'm great. Maybe if you just um, walk me to my car to be sure. Absolutely. - You know. - Where are you? I think I'm parked right over here. You sure you're okay? I'm totally fine. Are you there? Wow, uh, guess we got disconnected. Yeah, someone came and I had to cut you off. So, wait, how? I mean, I could feel you trying to come in. This uh, this kind of swimmy feeling in the back of my head, but I could stop it. That's good to know. Yeah. Um, I can't talk here. People are um, staring at me. Right. And yea, assuming I still got a job I need to get to it, but uh, I mean, we gotta talk about all this. Okay, later though. - Seven o'clock? - Okay. Well, wait that's uh, that's five my time, I'm still at work. Say ten, eight for me? Yeah, great, fine, okay. Okay. And if, you know, it doesn't work for some reason then uh... It was nice meeting you. Hey. It's snowing. ♫ ♫ ♫ Hey, hey, hey. On top. ♫ ♫ Oh, my God, it's almost ten. Why, yes, it is. Is it, is it some cause for excitement? No, no, no, no. Just we ate so late. Yeah, I told you it was gonna be a long day. Yeah, I know. No, I was just, I just meant, I just meant you must be tired and thinking about going to bed. Well, I'm not. Is that okay? Of course! Good. Actually um, there was a show I wanted to um, to watch. Oh yeah, that sounds fun for you. ♫ ♫ Oh, my God. Well, yeah, hi. Oh, boy, did I not expect this to work. I thought I was just... I know, I did, too. Oh, man, okay. Well, uh, I just, I spent all day just trying to think why this could be happening. So? Did you come up with anything? Well, you know, one thing did occur to me. Are you by any chance Satan? No. Um... My name is Rebecca. That's, wow, I didn't even think of that. I'm Dylan. Dylan. That's nice. This is a nice room. Is this your place? Uh, yeah, this is my house. I mean, it's my husband's. Oh, you're married. Yeah, why not? I mean, you got a name, you could be married, too. Did you tell him about it? Um... No, I uh... I, I just wasn't sure. Yeah, I mean, maybe it's better if you don't right away. I don't know, this is just hard enough to believe if it's happening to you. Yeah. I'm gonna wait. Wait. So, this is your house? No, it's yeah, yeah, it is, but uh, it's a little messy. It's kind of the maid's decade off. Wait, what are you doing? It's better this way. Shouldn't have to... I don't really have girls over too much. Oh, my God, I have to ask you! Did you um, did you get hit last night on the shoulder, like really hard? Yeah, I sure did! This son of a bitch just like came at me... With a pool cue! I know, I was there! And I was also at this dinner party. ...trying to fend him off. Becky? Sorry, it's Vicky Madden. I was just telling her about my smooth move last night. Oh. You must tell it really well. Yeah, what was that? Oh, God, yes, the kids sound amazing. I can't believe that. That was very smooth. Thank you, Vicky. So that was your husband? Oh, yeah. Um, yeah, that's Phillip. Good looking guy? Yeah, doctor, he runs the um, hospital here. Oh. Professional man. Yeah. I should probably go. Well, do you wanna talk again tomorrow? Okay, but after Phillip goes to work. You're not like, planning on getting hit again, are you? Well, let's see. It's not in my book. Nah, that wasn't nothing anyway. Worst I ever took was... Oh, my God. What? Let me ask you something. Did you ever go sledding? Did you ever go sledding and get really hurt? I hit a tree. Jesus H. God! I got knocked out cold. I mean, I must have been out for more than a minute. I still have the scar. Dylan, that was 20 years ago. I'll be damned. ♫ ♫ ♫ I got 12 stitches. And my mom never let me go sledding again. Not that I was all that keen to. Hey, what about when you were like I don't know, maybe 16? You were all torn up about something. I wanna say it was like, the dead of summer and, I mean it must have been a killer because I must have been cross-eyed for a month. That is so embarrassing. What? I can't tell you, it's um, too personal. Oh, come on, you got to! You owe me a whole July. That was... Walter, my first boyfriend. I was so in love with him. He was 20, you know? I don't know, we went out for like, two months and then he broke up with me right after we, you know. Oh, oh! No wonder. Yeah. I mean like, right after. What a dick. Sorry if I uh, ruined your summer. No, it's cool. I was, you know, pretty used to having like, weird moods and you know, stuff I couldn't really explain. Yeah, me, too. I pretty much thought that you were PMS. Yeah, a lot of people get us mixed up. I remember some other stuff, too, but, I don't know, I guess it's all kind of personal. Like your mom. Yeah, that figures. You were in college, right? Yeah. She wasn't ever very well. She was, like me, kind of? Not much of a physical specimen. Dylan, there's something, didn't make any sense to me at the time, but, you know, I always felt like there was someone with me. You know, just like a feeling. I felt it um, more strongly than ever after she died. It helped. Did you ever feel that way? Why don't you tell me? I remember your first night in prison. Oh, yeah, right. Time to come clean. What'd you do? I uh, just good with locks. Not that good with silent alarms. Got two years, in with mostly lifers. Yeah, I figured that was nightmares, it was really terrifying. Yeah. Yeah, I never felt as alone as I did in there doing my bid. You weren't. Hey, haha, Jesus, hey. What? Go look in the mirror. What? Come on! I don't even hardly know what you look like except mostly your hands. Um, um... Go on, show me. I, you know, why don't you do that? 'Cause I asked first. Well, I'm not doing it unless you do it, too. Okay. But after you. I'm not even dressed. Well, come on, whose fault is that, lazybones? Let's go. Fine. This is ridiculous, I'm scared. Oh, come on, what have you got to be scared of? Shut up, you're scared, too. Okay. I'm going to the mirror now. ♫ God, I'm beautiful. Oh, don't be stupid. No, when I said "beautiful" I meant, you know, ugly, wart covered, what did I say? Just don't flatter me because I spent the night in prison with you. What are you talking about? Hey, look, I was having fun being a beautiful girl there. I was all ready to go... buy hats or something, go back. No. No, it's your turn. Hold on, just give me a second. It's your turn! ♫ Read 'em and weep. ♫ You've got such a nice face. Nice, huh? Oh, no. I mean yeah, it is. Well, it ain't much, but it does cover my unsightly skull, so that's a plus. ♫ - Hi. - Hi. ♫ No, no, no, it was nothing like that. We um, we actually met when he, when he lectured at my school. I know, it sounds terrible, but it was really nice. We just got along great and... What did you say? Oh, nothing, it was the phone. Um, did you figure it out? I wish I could describe it better. It was like a chugging noise. Yeah, I know. What it is, you got a crack in your manifold. They go on you. You need to replace it. Okay. Let me check my stock and uh, probably rack you up today, yeah? Yeah, that's great. Excellent. Thank you. What year is your truck? Oh, uh, a 2010. There's no way the exhaust system on a Range Rover would go after just a few years. Here, turn her over. Okay, go look under the hood. Like, what, now? No, after he charges you 1200 bucks. Yeah, come on. ♫ Okay. What am I looking at? Okay. That sounds like it could just be the sensor got loose, so that should be over by the ABS. I don't know what that is. That, that, that boxy thing there. Okay, over here? Mmm, no. Okay, try the other side. Over here? Uh, it's like a multi prong thing. You're looking for like, a multi prong plug in thing. See that? Yeah, yeah, that's it. What do we do with it? Look, it's loose. Plug it in. There's your problem right there. The sound stopped. Yup. That's it? That's it. I fixed it. Yes you did, darling. Hey, you're in luck, I can take you today. We are in luck, the intake and exhaust manifolds are both fine. The um, uh... Sensor. ...sensor just needed tightening. I don't think that's gonna do you much good in the long run but, yeah, I can take care of it for you. No, that's all right, I already did it. Thanks, Stan. And they put me in prison. ♫ ♫ I've been looking ♫ ♫ For a fight ♫ ♫ All the trouble that I know ♫ ♫ Trying to lose the world inside ♫ ♫ But it's got no place to go ♫ ♫ Oh, I'm armed and dangerous ♫ ♫ And I'm deafened by the fray ♫ ♫ Waiting for the day I'm able ♫ What is that? ♫ And I said it all this way ♫ Oh, never. ♫ Take me home ♫ ♫ Let me go all day ♫ ♫ Just be here till I know ♫ ♫ Till I know that ♫ ♫ The riot's gone ♫ ♫ The riot's gone away ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ Turn it up, turn it up, gonna get fucked up ♫ ♫ I wanna make up now ♫ ♫ For all the things I saw that I can't control ♫ ♫ Cut it out, cut it out when it doesn't go ♫ ♫ So one day we wake up ♫ ♫ So when we wish to go we can zip and go now ♫ ♫ Take me home ♫ ♫ Let me go all day ♫ ♫ Just be here till I know ♫ ♫ Till I know that ♫ ♫ The riot's gone ♫ ♫ The riot's gone away ♫ ♫ Hey ♫ ♫ I heard it for a moment now ♫ ♫ Hey ♫ ♫ I hear you coming at me quiet ♫ ♫ Hey ♫ ♫ I heard it for a moment now ♫ ♫ The riot's gone ♫ ♫ The riot's gone ♫ Kershaw. So, how's the auto cleansing business treating you? Actually I've been thinking about looking for some new work. Who with? Bo, Lyle? I wanna see if I can't scare up something better. I mean, I ain't gonna quit or nothing, not till I'm sure, but... What's with you? You got a funny look. What? You look like you're about to kiss me. Well, I mean, when the light hits you like that something about your head... Well, solicitation is a crime, so what's going on, Kershaw? Nothing's going on. For such a smart man you are a piss poor liar. I met someone. Well, there it is! Yeah! You getting your pecker waxed, huh? She know you a con? She doesn't seem to mind. Oh, you got you one of them classy women. You'd be surprised. Nothing you do could surprise me. Over there. I like that you told him you had a girlfriend. Yeah, well, some people will believe anything. Come on, you've had girlfriends. Nothing that lasted more than a few dates. Just not good with women. What about your man needs? Becky! You got a mind like a sewer. Shoot. Move the other six back then you can move that one over. No, dummy, that's cheating. It's not cheating, it's creative. It's no fun to cheat, it's no fun if you win. The only reason you don't cheat is 'cause you're afraid someone will get mad. Can't always do what you're told, darling. Spoken like a true convict. I'm sorry. What, no, yeah, it's okay. I got no right to be touchy, it's all true. Oh, hey, uh... I think I figured it out. You know, why it happened or why we opened it up when we did. Really? Really. Why? Why not? What up, Dyl Pickle? Uh, I gotta go Becky, got something I gotta do. Okay, I'll see you. Gruman Tech Supply. The bitch is ripe, Dylan. Is it? You know our cousin, Adam? The one who beat that aggravated assault charge against the 7-Eleven clerk? Kicked his lard ass all up and down the freezer section. He's been working maintenance in the office park. He says Gruman is empty as church service on Super Bowl Sunday. Here's the best part. No silent alarms. Don't it just make your heart sing? You know Giddons is just drooling for me to make a move like this. Don't worry about Giddons, he'll sleep through it. Your end is two hours at most. You open up the pearly gates, we handle the rest. You don't wanna be seen with us, yeah, I get it, I get it, man. Hell, we'll mail you your cut. I could use some walking around money. Yeah, but this is more than just walking around money. We got a fence lined up in Wilberfield? He's gonna buy the whole lot. Your parole gets through, this is you setting up in a new town. Like a proper man. All you gotta do is keep your pretty trap shut, Dyl Pickle. Who's ever gonna know? ♫ I don't know, I just... Ain't exactly good timing for me. What else you gonna do man? You just gonna wax a bunch of Caddies? Dylan, this was your idea. When you got out you asked for some action. Something to get back on your feet, something safe. Now this is way the hell out in Bedlow and all that equipment's just sitting there. It ain't nobody's, it's gonna rust. There's no victim here. Just a true convict. Dylan, we let you in on this because you asked. Now I don't like you knowing if you don't have a stake in it. We'll be waiting on you, boy. Catch you soon, Dyl Pickle. ♫ ♫ ♫ Hey. Oh, Phillip! Sorry, you startled me. Sorry. You know how I get in these places. Yeah, I do which is why I'm surprised to see you here. Everything all right? Yeah, everything's fine. I was around and I had a wild notion you might be free for lunch. Uh, um... It was a pretty wild notion. Let-, I still got my doctor's cap on I'm afraid, um... Maynard's here to discuss his research program. Oh, the um, the schizophrenic narc... Narcotherapy. It's a big word hun. Oh, which reminds me next Thursday is the big fundraiser so don't put us down for anything. Okay. Okay, good. Dennis. Phillip. You remember my wife, Becky? Oh, yes, nice to see you again. Dr. Maynard. Do you two have plans? Oh, no um... I just need to remember to call ahead first if I'm going to be spontaneous. I see. Okay, I'll just leave you guys then. Okay, I shouldn't be late for dinner. Okay. And um, I'll see you Thursday at the fundraiser. I look forward to it. It's hard to tell right off. Yeah, I wish you could have spent more time with her. I just, I didn't know she was coming. Well I see what you're talking about. Her, her body language is very protective, very concealing. She's deeply uncomfortable. It's odd. Yeah, she's always been skittish. I, I just, I don't know. Wait, wait, who's this guy? That's Muffler Mike. His muffler's been busted for about eight years so everyone knows when he's coming. And that is Bob Breezy, we call him, yup, Breezy Bob. Okay, so it's not brilliant but... ♫ Yeah, I uh actually worked with him once on a highway job. He's got a real interesting smell. ♫ You got a problem, buddy? Tell him to go fuck himself. No. Go fuck yourself, dude. Nope, nope, no problem at all, we're cool. Such a wimp. Do you like it when we get hit? Hey, who's that, she's hot. Yeah, that's Donna, she's a nice girl. She's a nice girl? Is she married, is she covered in sores? Not to hear it. Wait, she's waving. I know. You guys are friends, ask her out. I'm not gonna just ask her. Don't be a wuss, you know you want her. Shut up. Look, she's coming over! What is this strange power you have over women? If you don't shut up I'm gonna shut you out. You better not, not when our girlfriend's here. Hey, Dylan. Come to me, wench. Hey, Donna. Hey. Are you here alone? Oh, Jenny's supposed to be coming, but... Haven't seen you around much lately. Haven't been around. Duh, say you like her shoes. Uh, I like your shoes. They, they work. I can't believe you noticed them. I got them on sale. They pretty much go with everything. See? You compliment them on something they did or bought, not like their eyes or something they were born with, that's how they know that you like them, you like their taste, you like their... Shut up. Hm? Oh, I just hate this song. You're joking, this is like, my favorite song. Oh, I know, just, I've heard it so many times. Oh, yeah, that's true, they do play it a lot. Ask her out, ask her out, ask her out! Say, Donna, I was thinking. Are you, are you busy Tuesday night? I'm busy most nights. What'd you have in mind? Oh, I just thought that uh... I could cook for you, I could cook for you. I could cook you dinner. You cook? Yeah, I mean, well, a thing or two. What do you like? Um, well I like steaks. Big steaks. All right, all right, yeah, I could, I'll fix you up a rare steak with a fancy sauce and trimmings for days. If you're not too busy. I am so smooth. Tuesday I'm seeing my momma, but I think Thursday I'm free. Done, dinner at 6:30. No, no, no, no, no. I'm busy Thursday night. You're not coming. Jenny's here. So 6:30. 6:30. Okay, gotta go, see ya. Phillip and I have a fundraiser Thursday night, you dope. Yeah, you think I want you coming on my date telling me how to kiss and stuff? Who made you ask her out? You couldn't even talk to her, you're nothing without me. Still not coming. I made you and I can break you. ♫ ♫ This event is going to be so great. It'll help with the Laramie Project. A charity donation is just like any other investment. You wanna know your money is being put to good use. Wow, you know, I can't think of a better place to put your money than in the research fund. Of course you can't, your husband's on the board! But no, you're right. Sick people are always the best. Real lump in the throat stuff, these hospital charities. Give me cripples every time. These are psychos, not cripples, but you know, would you mind excusing me just a minute? How's it going? What? How's it going? Oh, I'm fine, yeah. Why, what do you want? Nothing, I'm just checking in, seeing how it's going. Yeah, everything's great. Your sauce is burning. This is nuts. I haven't cooked anything that didn't take microwave instructions since ever. Here, smell this. What is that, um, rosemary? Yeah, too much? No, no! It's a little thick, though. Yeah, you said it's supposed to be thick. Yeah, but not like, thick as a brick. ♫ What? Oh, you hate this shirt. Oh, this is the wrong shirt, women everywhere revile this shirt. Dylan, maintain. The tie's a little rodeo, but it's gonna be okay. Yeah, easy for you to say. How's your money dinner? Oh, you know, stuffed shirts anonymous, I just have to worry about not falling asleep. Shit. Hey, you're gonna be great. Good luck. Thanks. ♫ Hi. How you doing? Good, how are you? Oh, shit. Well done. Okay. Everything, oh, that's good, that'll be great, yeah. - Come on in. - Okay. Never seen your place before. You haven't? I thought, you weren't out here for the Fourth? I don't think so. Oh, I thought you were. Yeah. I had a barbecue. It's kind of my own concept, barbecue on the Fourth of July. Lots of people do that. Uh, I uh, oh I like, really like your shoes. You got a thing for feet? Dated a guy like that once. Real weirdo. No, no, I don't. Can I get you something to drink? I did pick up some red wine if you like. Oh, you got a beer? Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely. I'll take one of those, actually. Thanks. Just twist, yeah, cheers. Cheers. So you really cook and everything? Now and then. Ew. What's this? It's the sauce. That smells kinda crazy. Oh, bimbo. Well, it's not for tonight. Okay. Yeah, I don't like my steaks all fancy. Just burnt black with tons of ketchup. Mmm. Figures. Figures what? Sorry? I thought you had spoken. Oh, gosh. Maybe I did. I think I was... Whoa, whoa! Oh, no! Hot, hot, hot! Oh! You missed it! Put it in the sink! In the sink, in the sink! Ah! There, happy now? Me? Maybe you better go wash that off, honey. Stay out of this, Phil. Oh, God. I'm so sorry. Yeah, why don't you go to the bathroom, collect yourself. I, you're right, honey... It's okay, it's okay. You guys okay? Yeah, yeah. Did you get anything on you? No, I'm fine but, is she all right? Yeah, she's fine, she's fine. ♫ Who's Phil? Just give me a second. Okay. What did you think you were doing? I told you not to come along anyway, I had everything under control. You had everything on fire! Yeah, well, that's the way I like it. Sure, burned black, tons of ketchup. It's none of your business what she eats, you yuppie snob, that's my date. Yeah, well, you know, you sure know how to pick 'em. What's the matter? Are you jealous? No, I'm not jealous! Then butt out! Why don't you make me? Just make me. You think I won't? Yeah, sure, try. There. - That's all you got? - Uhhuh. Stop it. Did it again, did it again. Dylan, stop, stop it. I won't, no, I'm not going to. I won't. Hey, Donna. Hey. I'm just uh, putting on some aftershave. Just freshening up a little. I'm gonna go. Donna! Dylan? Donna, wait! I was just making a joke. I was just putting on aftershave. You are gonna speak to me again before we die, right? What do you want me to say, Rebecca? Thank you, I'm so glad you made us look like idiots. You didn't even apologize to Dr. Maynard. I don't like Dr. Maynard. He always looks at me like he's trying to guess my weight. He was trying to raise money for an important project I happen to be involved with. Phillip, I can't say what happened. I think maybe I dozed off for a second. I was confused. Haven't you ever done that? That's not it. I mean, that may be true, but... Something is happening to you. And I don't know if it's what happened before or not. It's not, believe me. Okay, then what? What? I don't know, Phillip, sometimes... Sometimes you just look at everything and it's all just different. Do you know? Yeah, I do. They call that puberty. No, it isn't just then, it never stops. It's like um... Like shedding your skin. Is that what you're doing? Shedding? Yeah, I guess, sort of. Shedding me? No. No. ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ Hey. Hi. I'm really sorry, I know I messed it up, I know... No, no, it's cool. I would have messed it up myself anyway, you just saved me time. Give yourself a little credit. That girl really likes you. Well, if she did I think she got over that pretty quick when she caught me talking to the little man inside of my head. Yeah. Right. It's just sometimes when I'm with you I forget myself. You feel funny. What? Don't you feel funny? Like, not, not a fever, but... Oh, I uh... I was uh, previously engaged in a certain kind of activity and uh... Nope... heh... um... Well, you smell nice. Kinda sweaty. Sorry, that... That was out of line, I didn't uh... I should go. Okay. Um, look, I'm sorry about tonight. Yeah, me, too. Well, goodnight. Goodnight. ♫ Goodnight. ♫ Goodnight. ♫ Goodnight. ♫ Okay, well, wait, here goes a good one. Number seven, how does your partner rate as a lover? - Pass. - No, wait! Pass, pass, pass, that's none of your business. Of course it's my business, hush up. You describe your lovemaking as A, wild animals. B, sweet and slow. C, at least he tries. D... Who's he talking to? I don't know. Um, B, A, no, no. Yeah. B? Okay, if you say so. Nine, how often do you and your mate... No, pass! - Why? - Pass. Come on, this isn't gonna work unless... Wait. Turn up the radio. Oh, you like this? Yeah, I love this song. Oh, yeah, I remember this. ♫ I stand up ♫ ♫ So I can fall ♫ ♫ I storm out ♫ ♫ So I can wait for you to call ♫ ♫ I just look at you ♫ ♫ Baby, that's all ♫ ♫ I'm crumbling ♫ ♫ I wake up ♫ ♫ And you're not there ♫ ♫ I call all my friends ♫ ♫ Tell 'em I don't care ♫ ♫ I'm so cool, baby, and never mad ♫ ♫ I'm crumbling ♫ ♫ Hey. Phillip. Hi. Is this more uh, shedding? No. This is dancing. Ah, yeah, it is. Okay, um... I'll see you. So what brings the party down here? I was just looking for my old photo albums. I thought they were in the corner. Ah, yeah, yeah. Last time I saw them they were... God I hope Bridget didn't throw them out. No, that doesn't make any sense, she would have ask... Hey, I ran into Diane. She said you were gonna do the painting class. The drawing class. The drawing class, yeah. Yeah, I don't have to. What? No, I think that's great. You know, get you out of your, the cellar. Why would Bridget throw out my photos? No, I'm not saying, just, you know, whatever, by accident. What do you want with them? Nothing, I just wanted to show them to D-, to, to... myself, look at them. I'm not saying don't find them, it's a healthy thing, that's good. And I can help you look for them. I have my council meeting at six but um, you know, it won't kill me to be a few minutes late. Yes, it will. Thank you for knowing that about me. Hey, is my uh, gray shirt clean? Ah, yeah, I'll check. Thank you. Everything come out all right? You're drunk. I ain't had hardly nothing to drink. But give me time, partner. I got wine on my damn pants. What's Phillip gonna think? Where is ol' Phil? Meeting. Have I given you the tour of my luxurious home? Yeah, you have. Elegant, modern entertainment center. The perfect addition to every home. Did you find those pictures you were gonna show me? Mmm- They're gone. Well, wait a minute, what happened? They're gone. I have been through the entire attractively furnished house. Maybe the maid ate them. Or maybe... my husband slipped them into the trash. Are you serious? Why the hell would he do that? Because he knows me. Phillip takes care of me. That's not ta-, that sucks. He's not being mean. He knows how funky I get sometimes, looking through that stuff. Doesn't matter anyway, I know them all by heart. There's my mom when she's little. She has my eyes. Blue-gray with flecks of panic. And here's Mom teaching me how to swim. Notice how I'm grafted to her arm. Not a success. And there's a picture of a pony. I don't know why it's in there or who it belonged to, but there it is anyway. And there's my dad. Scariest man who ever lived. Grown ups were scared of him. All they ever taught me was how to be afraid. And I went out and found the copingest man alive so he could take care of me. So he could get rid of the past. Chipping away at it. All my little quirks and insecurities. Until... voila. Nothing left. ♫ Ha. ♫ Nothing like a little truth to sober you up, huh? ♫ I'll tell you about my family, I got a brother named Mitch. I think he lives down in Louisville now, moved 1500 miles away so that he wouldn't have to loan me any more money. My momma just, I put her through so much, by the time I got popped she stopped talking to me. She didn't even wait for the trial. I never met anyone I didn't disappoint. I mean, the best thing, the only thing about me that I like is you. ♫ ♫ ♫ I wanna feel your touch ♫ ♫ ♫ It's burning like an ember ♫ ♫ Oh, fuck. I wish you weren't so damn pretty, Becky Porter. I know it's dumb and shallow and, I mean you're a married woman and I'm on parole. Still, sometimes I think... Just wish you weren't so damn pretty. ♫ I'm giving in ♫ ♫ ♫ To the trouble I'm in ♫ ♫ ♫ So I'm giving in ♫ ♫ ♫ To the trouble I'm in ♫ ♫ ♫ To the trouble I'm in ♫ ♫ I wanna know what you feel like. ♫ You are, you are ♫ ♫ My favorite night of sad ♫ ♫ You are, you are ♫ ♫ You're where the lights began ♫ ♫ You are, you are ♫ ♫ Just one last time again ♫ ♫ You are, you are ♫ ♫ You are the trouble I'm in ♫ ♫ ♫ You are the trouble I'm in ♫ ♫ ♫ You are the trouble I'm in ♫ ♫ You are, you are ♫ ♫ My favorite night of sad ♫ ♫ You are, you are ♫ ♫ You're where the lights began ♫ ♫ You are, you are ♫ ♫ Just one last time again ♫ ♫ You are, you are ♫ ♫ You are the trouble I'm in ♫ ♫ ♫ You are the trouble I'm in ♫ ♫ ♫ Oh, cut it out, it's good. It's cool! Look at Diane's. That's a little abstract there, darling. Try drawing the nice man. ♫ Dylan, my office. Gotta go, darling. Okay, I'll see you. What's going on, Jake? It's no good. What is? It's no good. It doesn't work. Wait, wait, am I fired? Okay, you're me, Dylan, okay? What would you do? Keep the ex con who talks to himself all day? You frighten the customers. Look, next time you get a gig, okay, just let your imaginary friend stay at home. Okay. You gotta start living in the world, brother. You gotta be where you at. You understand what I'm saying? Be where you at. Okay. I'll give you a recommendation if you need one. I won't lie. But I-, I'll say you were honest. Th... ♫ ♫ What happened, bro? ♫ ♫ Hon, I'm your friend. Oh, good. I mean, yes, of course you are. You can tell me. You really should. Sweetie, I honestly, I have no idea what you're talking about. Not at all? Everybody's concerned. Is something going on? You can tell me. There's just really nothing to tell. Have you been seeing someone? Oh, God, no. No, no, no, no, no. I couldn't, I'm married, I would never. Oh, I meant a shrink. You're having an affair, oh my God. Oh, no, no, no. You don't have to tell me who unless you want to because I'm very good at keeping... Diane, I'm not, I'm not having an affair. And we never had this conversation. Oh, poor Phillip. Oh, I didn't mean that. You know, you don't have to tell me who, that just explains everything. Explains what? Well, I don't mind telling you now that I know you're not crazy, but everybody's talking. Well, you must know that. Everybody's talking about me. Why? Don't they have lives? My lips are sealed. They are zip locked. You don't have to tell me who he is, but is it someone I know... Diane, honestly, I'm not having an affair, I'm not, I swear. Okay? I'm just crazy. ♫ Amazing! This is possibly the greatest game of pool ever played. Hi, Dylan. Hey, queen of the rodeo. Rodeo queen, huh? What'd, you come to watch me make pool history? Had a few pitchers, haven't you? My only regret is that I gave up my law practice to become a showgirl. Can I pour myself one? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, hey, hey, have a beer. I'm just gonna find this ball. So Wayne says that Jake gave you the can. That blows. Don't it, sister? Where the hell you been hiding at, Dyl Pickle? Thank God, you've come. Is it time to do crimes? Yeah, man, we been waiting on ya. Cue ball. Enough dicking around. Are we doing this or not? Hell yes, let's do it. Let's do it. All right, here's the address. Need you to roll up there, check the place out. We go in Thursday night. Let's do it now. Let's do it now, I mean, what am I waiting for, right? This is what I do. I mean, I'm a criminal element man type, man. Just like you. Like, who am I kidding? Maybe you've had enough, Dyl. Maybe you wanna head home, sleep it off. Oh, no, I want some action! I want some Action Jackson! Come on, let's get lost. Hey, you can be my moll. Yeah. I mean, I gotta have a moll. See, I got this problem, y'all. It's the Jiminy the Cricket is gonna get all upset with me, man, and I can't go messing with Jiminy the Cricket. He lives in my head with Mr. Cr-, excuse me, Dr. Cricket. And what am I gonna do when she finds out that I'm just like everybody said? What am I gonna do then, Bo? You got voices in your head? Is that what you're saying? You don't believe me? - Donna? - He does. Yeah, I have a world of craziness up here, man. So you might wanna find somebody a little more stable to be your wire man. Maybe I'm not your guy. I mean, burglary is a pretty tricky piece of business. It's time to shut your mouth now, Dyl. You know what, I'm getting so sick of everybody telling me what to do. All right, step back Dylan, just step back. You two, get the hell out of my bar. All right, Wayne, put the gun down. Okay, Wayne. Man, I got a lump on my head the size of Nebraska. Shut up Lyle, shut up, it's okay, everything's fine. Am I bleeding there? Everything's fine. Shut up, Lyle. I don't care how long we known each other. You screw this up... Bo, look at my hair, man. Am I bleeding? Bo, my head's gonna be all discolored. ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ Diane. Hi, I just got the call that you were here. To what do I owe this pleasant surprise? ♫ What? ♫ ♫ ♫ Do you recognize it? ♫ That doesn't even look any smaller. I never came here again. I was scared. I just felt like there was something here. Something too grown up. Too real. Do you think this is the place I first went nuts or does it go further back? Come on, you're not crazy, Becky. I was once. Right after college. Before Phillip and I were engaged. I... Kind of fell apart. Couldn't deal with being in the world so I spent some time in a hospital upstate. ♫ Rehabilitating. I didn't know about that. Yeah, you missed that one. Probably because I missed most of it, too. I couldn't feel anything. I'd just lay in bed for three months trying to work up enough energy to cry. ♫ Phillip was with me through all of it, he read to me, he sat with me. Tried to get me through it. He probably did. Sure wasn't me. So goddamn weak. Becky, how can you say that? I mean, what you did for me? Have I made your life any easier, honestly? Yes. ♫ You know, I can't read your mind, Dylan, but I know when you're lying. Becky, don't do this. I can't live like this. Dylan, Phillip is my husband. I know you don't like him, but I need to be with him. I need to find him again. Yeah, you gotta do what you're told, right? That's not fair. Fair? I finally for once in my life, I could see something, something real and then you tell me I gotta give it up, so how do you come at fair? I can't be with you and I... I can't play at this anymore. It's not a game, it's not something that you play. What am I supposed to do? You are going to be fine. God, Dylan. You have so much. You... You blew me away. You know that, you... I'm never gonna forget that. Couldn't we just... No. How do you expect me to just shut you off? Because you love me. ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ Give me a whiskey neat, please. The thing is you come in here and there's always some kind of trouble. Is that what you hear? Not too nicely, though, you were in here doing your little MMA style tango with the Soames brothers. They showed up, I left. We didn't associate. Dylan, this ain't a goddamn drill, okay? You went and got yourself fired, you're hanging out with known felons and now Lyle is looking to bust your ass... Giddons, look can you...? No! No, no. No, no! Please, no. What's wrong with you? Please! ♫ Dylan. Dylan! What the hell's wrong with you? Those bastards! Who, Bo and Lyle? You know what I'm looking at right now? A cell. Hey, you tell me what's going on with them brothers you won't even have to think about that. No, I mean I'm looking at it right now, I'm in it. What? This is where they put me, 'cause this is where they see me. What, wait a minute. So this is when you start blaming the whole world for your crap, is that right? No, no, this is where I stop. We ain't finished. ♫ I want you to get better. To stop... worrying about everything. Everything's gonna be fine. You just need to be alone for a while. No distractions. Till you feel yourself again. ♫ Rebecca. I love you. ♫ ♫ ♫ Oh, fuck. Ah! Hey. Now we both got lumps on our heads. It's Thursday! Time to go to work, Dyl. I gotta be somewhere. Yeah, and we know where. You know, I told Bo that we should bust you up and leave you there when we're through, but he's got a code. Two hours and comfortable living, Dyl. No, I need to be somewhere, I'm asking. And I'm answering. ♫ ♫ We'll worry about forms later. None of your people will even know she was here. I'm betting she'll be back to normal in just a couple of months. Maybe. ♫ ♫ Did you see who was driving that car? Okay. ♫ ♫ Becca. We are currently at a cruising altitude of... Becca. Can you hear me? Come on, answer me, Rebecca. Dylan. Jesus Christ. Rebecca, what is going on? Phillip put me in here. I think he thinks I'm having an affair. So he locks you up? Can he do that? I don't know. I'm afraid of him. I don't know what he's gonna do. God, you feel like you're underwater. What are they giving you? Phillip gave me these pills. I took them. He told me to take them so I took them. Don't you know where you are? Yeah, I'm in the um... I think it's the um, Hophauer Clinic. It's a mental institution. Your husband oughtta be a permanent resident, darling. Once again, we do request... You're in a plane? I'm, I'm headed your way. Listen, I need to see the room. I want you to look around, I wanna see everything. ♫ Is there anything you can do or... I understand, Sir, but unfortunately we cannot rent you a vehicle without a valid driver's license. I just, I just don't have it with me right now is all and I have a real important job interview. And I do hope you get that job. What I can do is arrange a cab for you. Perhaps a friend can overnight your license while I hold the res... Sir? Thanks. ♫ ♫ ♫ Where are you? Still at the airport. What are you doing? Renting. Hey, you, stop! ♫ Now twist it to the left. Slowly. Okay, now see if you can find the empty space in there. I can't do this, I feel like a four year old. You can do it, just relax. This ain't Fort Knox, these are simple locks. Oh um, turn here. Where did you learn to do all this stuff anyway? Um, school mostly. I always wondered what you guys did in shop. I bet you took ballet, huh? Or tea appreciation or something. Oboe. Haha Holy shit, holy shit. Hot damn, that took me a week to learn that! You're a natural born criminal. I bet you say that to all the girls. Am I close? Yeah, I think so. Just keep going all the way through town. It's right by the train tracks, you can't miss it. Okay, I'll find it, time to get a move on now. Anybody in the hall? Um, wait a sec. Wait till she leaves the hall. Check. Nervous? Check. Listen, when you get out of there, um, you ever seen Canada? Why, what did you have in mind? I thought maybe you'd like to have a romance in an exotic setting. ♫ Go for it, just walk like you know where you're going. ♫ ♫ Oh, shit. ♫ ♫ Do you have any idea where I am? ♫ No, get back on Main Street. ♫ Not a good idea. Shit. Turn off the engine and show me your hands. How are you doing today? ♫ Here goes nothing. Stop the car. ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Dylan, I can't talk to him, I can't. Becky, calm down, you can do this. Okay, okay. I'm just gonna walk past him, it's gonna be totally fine. ♫ Rebecca? What are you doing? Oh! Told you I couldn't talk to him. Go, Becky, just go. Phillip. Call security. Rebecca! ♫ He's gone. ♫ The woods. The woods, go! ♫ ♫ ♫ Hear that train? Yes. Run for it! ♫ ♫ I'm here. Where? ♫ Where? Where? Here. ♫ There's an open boxcar, see it? Where? This red boxcar right here. Red boxcar, see it? Yes! Okay, go! ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ This is gonna be so weird. ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ Down by the river ♫ ♫ It don't matter which river ♫ ♫ They're all going somewhere ♫ ♫ Well, just as long as you're looking for me ♫ ♫ Well, just as long as you're looking for me ♫ ♫ Well, just as long as you're looking for me ♫ ♫ Well, just as long as you're looking for me ♫ ♫ I can be a good friend ♫ ♫ And I can be a good lover ♫ ♫ And I can be a good lover ♫ ♫ But I can't do both of them ♫ ♫ No, I can't do both ♫ ♫ I can hope ♫ ♫ Well, just as long as you're looking for me ♫ ♫ Well, just as long as you're looking for me ♫ ♫ Well, just as long as you're looking for me ♫ ♫ Well, just as long as you're looking for me ♫ ♫ Well, just as long as you're looking for me ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ Well, come and stand in the water ♫ ♫ Well, come and stand in the water ♫ ♫ Tell me that you don't care ♫ ♫ Shaking and shivering ♫ ♫ Time is making jokes at my expense ♫ ♫ While dancing in the riverbed ♫ ♫ Well, just as long as you're looking for me ♫ ♫ Well, just as long as you're looking for me ♫ ♫ Just as long as you're looking for me ♫ ♫ ♫ Well, just as long as you're looking for me ♫ ♫ Well, just as long as you're looking for me ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ Now you know everything ♫ ♫ Did I scare you off ♫ ♫ Did I show too much ♫ ♫ The future's unraveling ♫ ♫ I'm losing my sense of touch ♫ ♫ So I reach out in the dark ♫ ♫ I hope that you'll be there ♫ ♫ To shine some light ♫
