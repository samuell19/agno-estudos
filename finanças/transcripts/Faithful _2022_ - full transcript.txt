I gotta get on this right now. - No, I'ma handle this. Come on Rich. Let's go. - Wait Adam. It's my job. I'm supposed to protect you. - Like I said, I'ma handle this, all of this. - Adam, please. If you need anything, call me, okay? - I appreciate that, but I got this. Thanks though. Man, I just knew something wasn't right with him. Look I need you to stop all his access to my company. - Already done. - 'Lieve I trusted him. Ain't even see this shit comin'. Man, this has been one hell of a day. - Yeah well let's get back to the airport. - Don't forget to carry the one. - Okay, look at this. - I think you got it. Good job, Sammy. - Good job, Sam. Looks like somebody's gonna be an accountant when they get older. - I don't wanna be a accountant. I wanna run Daddy's company. - Well, you know what? I think that'll be very possible. - Today at Playground Gallery in Detroit, artist Malik Brown will have his work on display. Brown is viewed as one of the hottest up and coming artists of his generation. Let's take a look. - You think you can watch him for me tonight? - Yeah. That's not gon' be a problem. I was gon' stop by my mom house, but I'll call and let her know I'm going straight home from here. - Okay. Can you tell Ms. Debra I said hey? Mm hm. - I'm 'bout to go upstairs and get dressed. I'ma order y'all a pizza. - I want all the meats on it. - Mkay. - Hello? - Hey, you sound like you in a good mood. - I wouldn't say that.

I'ma just grab something to eat on the way home. - I ordered Sam a pizza with all the meats on it. - Oh, okay. I could have that. Well I'll see you when you get home. - Yes you will. I love you. - I love you with all of my heart. - I know. You always show me. - And I'm supposed to. Besides I had a bad day and you're the only one that make my days better. - And that's what I'm supposed to do. - You do. I'll see you tonight. - All right. Mom? - Yeah, baby? - Why did you name me Samuel and not Cameron? I like Cameron. - Because you're named after my father. - I wish my name was Cameron. Well, when you get older and you decide you want people to call you Cameron, you can do that. - I'm gonna start now. - That's fine, Sam. - My name is Cameron. - Okay, Sam. - Cameron. - Alright.

Uh, today's a very big day for me, um, because, uh, honestly I never thought I would be selling something that people actually wanted to buy. Um, this the first piece I painted after losing my brother. Uh, so for me, this is a very special piece, um, but I'm actually ready to see it in a home that's gonna love it, uh, because, uh, every time I look at it, I just get emotional. So with that being said, Mike, can we start the bidding? - All right. Thank you all for coming. Are we ready to bid big? - Yeah. - Yes. All right. We're gonna get the bid started at $5,000. Do we have $5,000? $5,000. $5,500? $5,500. $6,000? $6,500? Okay, I'm gonna go ahead and say $10,000. Do we have $10,000? $15,000? Do we have $16,000? - $50,000. - $50,000?

Congratulations. - What are you doing? - Buying a painting. - I know that, but you got $100,000? - Yeah, I think you're worth it. - Thank you. - Here's the check. - Oh, thank you. And what address would you like us to ship to? - The one on the check is fine. - Thank you so much, Miss Hewer. - Thank you. - Jaclyn. Where you going? - I'm 'bout to go home. Thank you for the tickets though. I really appreciated it. - Look, I know I thanked you already, but I really have to thank you again. Sh. Sh. Sh. Sh. - Hey, hun. You okay? - Yeah. I-I'm on my way home now. I just, I just got in the car. - Okay, good. I love you. - Okay. I love you too. - Who's that? - My husband and I gotta go. You gotta go. - Hey. How was it? - How was what? - The art show? - Oh, it was good. You know, it ended up being a auction? - Mm. - Mm hm and I bought us something. - Huh, okay. Well I can't wait to see it. - And I can't wait for you to see it. I'm 'bout to take a bath. - All right. Well, I should be finished by the time you get out. - Malik. Malik. Mm. Malik. What are you doing? You have a good husband. - Hey, what's wrong? Nothing. - Then why are you crying? Is everything okay? - As long as I got you, everything will always be okay. God, what did I just do? - So you really telling me I can't fire him? - No, it's better if you let the feds handle him. So how long do I gotta act like I like him? - Just long enough for the government to do their job. In the meantime, I'll have a man on him 24 hours a day. - Can't believe he'd put my company in jeopardy like this. He was really gon' try and take my company from me. And I was a damn good boss to him. - Everything's gonna work out, all right? I promise. Excuse me. - Hey. - Hey. Wait, damn. Isn't it your birthday? - Yes, it is. - Honey, did you get what we discussed? - You talking about the birthday gift? - Yes, the gift. - Course I did. Sam? - Yes, Mom? - Give Miss Debra her birthday gift. No way. Nah huh. Y'all bought me a house? Uh, why would y'all do this? Oh my God. - Because we love you. - Baby, I love you too, but y'all I can't take this. - Yes, you can. You can and you will. Look. You've been with us for a long time now. Your daughter's been like a big sister to Sam. Y'all practically helped us raise him. Look, we would've went crazy without the two of you. So you gon' take that house and you gon' love it because it's yours. - Uh, y'all are the best. Uh, I don't know how I'll ever repay y'all. - By enjoying your new house. - Oh, I sure am. I love this. Well, I forgot about... Um, there's a Mrs. Washington here to see you. - Send her in. - Okay. Come on, baby. Why you didn't tell me y'all bought me a house, huh? - Where you going looking like a supermarket? - Well I'm going shopping and then me and Kelly are going to go to lunch. - Mm hm. - But I won't be gone long. - Mm. You smelling good. What's that you got on? - Kimberly New York. - Well, it smells amazing. - Thank you. I can come back. - I'm sorry. My husband never misses a chance to show me how important I am to him. - Yeah, I'm sorry. I just never want her to leave me sometimes. I'm sorry. Are you married? - I was, but, um, my husband died from cancer six months ago. - I'm sorry to hear that. - I am too, but this is good. Always show her that you love her and tell her as often as you can. If I have any regret is that I didn't tell my husband more often that I love him. - Well, he does a great job at that. But I'm not gon' hold y'all up. I gotta get going 'cause I don't wanna have Kelly waiting. - All right. I'll see you later. Well, I am Adam Hewer and this is my associate Rich Steed. You can have a seat. - I am Maria Washington. - It's nice to meet you. Boss, I'm gonna go take care of that. - Okay. Have a seat. - Well, I am glad to finally meet you in person. You are the talk of the tech community. - Thank you. - And you did it all without any Silicon Valley money. - Hm. Yeah, well, I took my buyout that I made from my last job and I developed Live Talk. I knew that if I bet on me, the world would love it. - But why didn't you take the Google and Facebook money when they came with an open unlimited checkbook? - Simple. If they wanted it that bad, why shouldn't I keep it? - Can you explain that? - Look, I came from nothing. My mother had me and my brother and we basically had to share clothes. We knew nothing about generational wealth. We knew check to check. So when they came to me with what most people might consider enough, I knew that it wasn't. And it was at that moment that I realized that somebody had to come to them with that same offer they making me and they said no. And now they're the ones that's making the offers. Wouldn't you wanna be the ones making the offers, Miss Washington? - That is powerful. So, tell me how the name Live Talk came about. - Well, I got my ideas from... Malik! - Who is it? - It's me, Jas. I mean, Jac. - I didn't think you was gon' really come. - I didn't think I would be here until I got here. - It's crazy, man. I really couldn't, um, sleep without thinking about you last night. - I know the feeling. I couldn't sleep last night either. Thought about you too. - So how long have you been married? - I don't wanna talk about my husband. So can we talk about something else? - And I think it's important we talk about him. - And I don't. So let's just change the subject. Why? - Because I love my husband and he's a good man and I love my son, but it's just something missing. And it's something about you. - What about me? - I'm just comfortable when I'm with you. Like when we was at the gym and you had your hands all on me. I didn't want you to stop touching me. I really wanted you to kiss me right there in the middle of that gym. - Well, why didn't you kiss me? - Because I'm married and I'm wrong for being here. I gotta go. - Wait. Where you going? - Home. - You right where you should be. Well, all you have to do is what I say do. Nothing more, nothing less. I want you to be mines. - She's still not answering, eh? - Hey. - Hey, I've been calling you. - I know. Me and Kelly went... We got massages and facials. - Well, I was a little worried. It's not like you to not answer your phone. - Adam, I said I went and got a massage. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. I'm all right. I'll see you when I get home, okay? - Yeah. Okay. Jax? Yeah? - I love you. - Yeah, me too. - Where you going? I'm going home. - Man, you right where you supposed to be, man. Lay down. - No, I should be at home with my family. You know I've been married to my husband for 12 years and I've never cheated on him? - What you telling me that for? - Because I'm not some hoe. - Who you trying to convince? Me or yourself? - Fuck you! - Wait. I don't even mean it like that. - Nah, fuck you! And I mean that! - Calm down, man. I don't even mean it like that. Jaclyn! Jax! Fuck man. Damn. I can't believe this is happening Jax. What the fuck? Like what are you doing? Fuck. God. Hello? - Hey, is that you? - What? What you talking about? On the street? Is that you? - Oh girl. Yeah. I done caught a flat on my tire. - Okay. We got you. - We 'bout to pull up on you. - All right. Your jack and spare in the trunk? - Yep. - All right. Give me about five minutes. I got you. - Girl, why you looking so stressed? It's just a flat tire. - Girl, I wish it was just a flat tire. - What's going on? - Can I ask you a question? - Yeah. What's up? - How long y'all two been married? - God. 15 long, hard, stressful, but beautiful years. - You never thought you made a mistake? Like you married the wrong person? - Yeah. Three days a week. But the other four show me that I made the right choice. Why? Why? What's up? - You ever thought about cheating on him? Thought about? I did. I know. I just... At that moment, the other guy made feel like he was giving me something that I needed, but girl, he wasn't shit. - What you mean? - I mean, any man that messes with a married woman does not want you. And the moment you leave your husband, you realize you didn't have shit in common with this guy other than sex. - But what happens when everything just get boring? Like when you want your husband to fuck you? - Then fuck him. Girl, put on a porno and tell his ass to do what he sees. - Girl, I guess. - Look, Jax. We all have these phases where we want something new where we feel like we can do better than what we have. But girl, you don't wanna make that mistake. When Mark found out I cheated on him, it killed him. It took me years to prove to him he was all I needed. You hear me? You don't wanna hurt the man you love like that. If this is something you're seriously thinking about, don't, okay? - All right. - Jax, I'm serious. - Okay. - All right. - All done. You good. - Thank you. Look, I owe both of y'all dinner. - You know he can eat. - Oh, I know. But what about you? - Well, I have this little two piece I'm tryna squeeze into so I'ma take a rain check. - Girl, I hear you. But look, Trina, I really, really, really appreciate you. - Girl, stop thanking me. You know you're family. Cut it out. You just tell that little sexy cook of yours I want my favorite, the pasta. - No he ain't sexy. - Babe, you know, you're all I want. I just want his food and I want your. - Baby you a freak. - Your little freak. - I'll see y'all two later. - Bye girl. - Thank you. - You have a good day. - These are really pretty. Thank you. - I'm just looking for something small, lil' key chain. How much is this? You're in luck. That's only $3. - Can I get it? - Absolutely. Why are you acting like this? Kiss on me right now here and look at you. I feel like I'm losing my woman. Stop it. Stop what? I'm not an ochre. Coya, I love you. Not now. - Girl, pick up the phone. - Hello? - Hey baby. What's up? What you doing? - Nothing. I just had a flat tire, but it's fixed now. What's up with you Ma? How's Daddy? - Well, not much. And you know your Dad. He just being your Dad, acting like a old man. - Ma, can I ask you something and you not judge me? You okay? - Yeah. I'm good. I just need some advice. - All right. I'm listening. - You ever felt like you and Daddy's relationship just reached it's peak? - All the time, but then I find another way to take it to another level. - So you never thought about leaving him, even after all the times he cheated? You didn't feel short on the bills? You never just wanted to just leave? - Now. I didn't say that. I wanted to leave 1,000 times, but I realized it's nothing out there. And before I start a relationship with somebody new, I might as well work on this one. - You know what? You right. I need to work on fixing my relationship before I do something I'm gon' regret. - I think that would be a good idea. And like I said, I just called to check on you. - Hey Ma, I'm thankful that I still got you in my life. I really love you. - I love you more baby. Now, you go and you make your marriage better, okay? - I promise Ma. I will. - That's all I can ask. And baby, remember, don't nothing beat a failure, but a try. - I'll talk to you later. Bye. What are you over there thinking about? Adam. Adam. Sorry. - What's on your mind man? - Nothing really. - Mr. Hewer, you got a package. - Coming down now. Take that. You can have him take it in there for me. Okay. Come with me. - Why that look? - My wife bought a painting for $100,000. - $100,000? Jesus Christ. - Thanks a lot. You take care, okay? 'Preciate that. - Aw thanks, my baby. Oo, that's a nice tip. Hey Rich. How you doing? - I'm good. How are you Debbie? - I'm good. I'm good. So are you gon' stay for dinner? - No, actually, I have something to take care of, but I'll take a rain check for ya. - Debra, are you staying for dinner? And I'm not taking a rain check from you. - Mm mm. You gon' have to. Because I wanna go see my new house in person. I'll see y'all later. - Well, I guess it's just gon' be the three of us. - Well, Sammy just left to go stay at Chuck's. - Chuck's? His mom lets them eat junk food all night. - He'll be fine. - Well, I guess it's just the two of us then. - I guess so. Mm. So you get a chance to see Sammy's little girlfriend? Jax. - I'm sorry baby. Were you saying something? - Are you happy? - What is happy? I mean like really what is it? We got a lot of money. We have nice cars. Our son is healthy and extremely happy, but what are we doing? - Well, I live for you and Sam. I mean, what else you want me to do Jax? Because for you, I will do anything. - I got you something. - You did? - Yeah. It's not nothing really big. It's just something to tell you that I'm sorry. - And I love it. - And I love you. Malik. - Hm. Mm. You good bae? - Yeah. I'm okay. - Yeah I know, baby. I'll be home soon. Yeah, I miss both of y'all. All right, babe. Kiss the baby for me. Love y'all. Alright, I'll talk you soon. - Mm. Fuck! - Mm. What you 'bout to do? - Got a few errands to run. - Oh yeah. That picture you bought came. - Really? Mm hm. - Great. What did you think? - I didn't look at it. - Why? I bought it for you. - Really? So you spent $100,000 on a picture for me from a artist I never even heard of? - Well, nobody knew who Van Gogh was before he became Van Gogh. - Good point. - Well, do you wanna see it? Sure. - All right. Just gimme a second. I'll come back and show you. - All right. Hmph. So what you think? - Actually, I think I see why you bought it. I like this. What's the artist name? You really like it? Yes. I like this. - Um, Malik Brown. - Hm. What else do he got? I think I wanna meet him. - Meet him? I really don't know how to get in contact with him, but I can get his info for you. But I know you like it. - That's because you know me very well. You know I love you and Sam, right? - And we love you too, very much, but I gotta hurry up. I gotta get ready to go. - So, right now I have the power to let you buy 30% of the shares of Live Talk. After that, you can buy the ones from 15 other investors who have between 21 and 25%, putting you at roughly 51 to 55%, and complete control of the company. - Are you sure you can make this happen? It just seem like a lot of moving parts with this deal. - Moving parts is what I do best. Yes, I'm sure. I'm willing to bet my life on it. - How much are you talking? Exactly how much would you need from me? - Well, now we're talking. $10,000,000 and I will make you the most powerful woman of your time. - Bitch. - Excuse me? - Sorry. Sorry. I see a friend of mine's wife in here. He's not here. She's doing the things she should be doing with him with another guy. - I see. I was about to say. Well, it doesn't seem like she's a good wife to your friend. - Loyalty is everything. - I agree. Are you loyal? - Yes I am, loyal to the most important person in the world. - And who would that be? Your wife? Cassandra, I like your style. Myself. I'm loyal to me. You see, I understand that the one thing you can bet on is that a person will always do what's best for them. - And is that why you're doing this deal? You're doing what's best for you? - I'm doing what any good business man would do to feed his family. - Okay. I'm in. Where would you like for me to send the money? - I will send that to you in an hour. Thank you. - Sounds good. By the way, are you gonna tell your friend about his wife? - Like I said, a person's always gonna do what's best for them. She's just doing what's best for her. - I hear that, but we'll be talking soon. - Thank you. You won't regret this. - I hope not. Remember, you bet your life you could get this done, right? - Right. - This is Rich Steed. - Hey, it's Cassandra. Here's the deal. I'm supposed to send him $10,000,000 when he texts me where to send it. - Okay, perfect. Let me know when he sends you the wire information. He's our first meeting this morning and I'm on my way to pick up Adam right now. - He's really a self righteous son of a bitch. - Yes. That he is. Just keep me posted about the wire information, all right? - Okay. Thanks. I'll wait for your text to send it. - How you doing, Rich? - Good, sir. How you doing this morning? - Cool, I guess. - Can I ask you something? - Yeah. Go 'head. - You believe in love at first sight? - I don't know about that one. Why you asked me that? - 'Cause felt like second I saw you, I knew you was the one for me. - You know I really didn't sleep that well last night. - No? How come? What's been going on with you, man? You should be happy. Company's about to go public, literally making you one of the richest people on the planet. - Yeah. Well money isn't everything, Rich. The more that I live, the more I realize that Sammy and Jax are the reason I smile, not the money. - How many women are you sleeping with? - Why you asked me that? - 'Cause we're having unprotected sex and I don't wanna take nothing home to my husband. - You the one cheating on your husband. You shouldn't have been asking me about how many people I'm with. I should be asking you about how many people you with. - I ain't mean it like that. - What you mean it like then? - I'm just saying I really like you. And I know I can't ask you not to see other women, but I'll just wish you wouldn't. - Look. Let's not talk about other people when we together. I'm not gon' ask you about your husband. And I would love it if you just don't ask me about other women. Let's just enjoy each other time. - Okay. I'll play by your rules. I'm scared that I like you too much. Look. I promise not to break your heart if you promise not to break mines. - And I promise to protect yours with everything in me. - Good. - Listen, uh, back to business here. Sandra met with William this morning. - Okay and? - Told her $10,000,000. - Really? All of my life's work is only worth $10,000,000 to him? Wow. - Well, he's your first meeting this morning. She's not gonna send him anything until we tell her to. - Good. I'll take it from there. - She just sent the wire information. - Okay. Let her know we gon' be with him in 20 minutes. And you gonna let her know when to send the money. - All right. You got it. You know, I can't help but wonder why a man that is getting everything would cross the person that has done everything to make their lives better. - Because men don't wanna say another man helped them, but real men know that you won't get nowhere in life without the help from another person. I learned so much from the people before me and I have no problem with giving people their credit. - Excuse me, Adam. William is here. - Send him in. Hey, text her and tell her to send the money. - You got it. - Hey, Hey. Hey. How you doing? - I'm good. And you? - I'm well. Thank you. How's Jaclyn and Sam doing? - They good. - Great. Great. Glad you and the family are well. Are you? - Yes. Yes. I am. - Rich can you take yourself and Yolanda to a early lunch? - I'd rather not. - Leave now. So do you really care how my family is doing? - Yeah, of course. Why would you even ask that? - Because I saw the way you smiled when you just got that text message. You care to share? - Share what? - What made you smile so much in your text. - No. I'd rather not. - Why? - Because it's my phone and it's private. - Come on, man. It's not that damn private. - Adam, it was a text from my wife. - Really? I never thought your wife was that damn funny. - What the hell is that supposed to mean? - It means you a lying ass bitch. - Who the fuck are you talking to? - A lying ass bitch. I wanna say son of a bitch, but your parents ain't got nothing to do with this. Do you even know what I did before I got into computers? - No. Why? - Because I think if you did know, you wouldn't be trying to fucking play me. See it's niggas like you that go to those fancy schools and get y'all degrees that will never understand me. - What the hell are you talking about? - You think you better than me and that's sad because I had your back. I'm the one that gave you a chance and you crossed me. - I never crossed- - Man watch who you talking to! I don't work for you! Now what the hell was so funny that made you smile in your text message?! - Jesus Adam. My wife sent me a naked picture. - Nigga stop lying! Your wife body ain't even that goddamn bad. - Watch it. - Be honest. It was that $10,000,000 that Cassandra just sent you wasn't it? - I can, I can explain that, all right? I'm... You a, you a bitch? A lying ass bitch? Man I hate the fact that I even trusted you. So was that $10,000,000 worth it? - No, it's not about the money, Adam. It's about the power and I wanted it. Let me go. I can't breathe. - Oh, you wanna fucking breathe? You don't care if my fucking kids ate. I should fucking beat the life out you right now. But you ain't even worth it. What?! Speak. - Get off. - What's good? - So I'ma ask you again. Was that $10,000,000 worth it? - No. Of course not. - No? But it was when you thought it was gon' help her take my company away from me wasn't it? I should take your life. - I'll give her the money back. I swear to God- - I don't want you to do shit, but to get the fuck outta my building 'fore I kill yo weak ass. - But listen, I can get- - But nothing! Get the fuck out! Now! - So this is it? - Wait really? Just know I'm not gon' rest until I make your life hell. So matter of fact, I think I'm gon' rest real good tonight. What's that supposed to mean, Adam? - Check your accounts. Check all three of your accounts. - What are you even talking... Where's all my money, Adam? Where's all my money? - Yo' money? Oh, that $10,000,000 is back in my account and that $300,000 in change, oh, that's going to Cassandra and you, you going to jail. Your wife is gonna leave you and your kids are gonna hate you. - Leave my kids- - I don't give a fuck if them little bitches starve! And you lucky I don't want your ugly ass wife or that bitch would belong to me too. - Wake up! Your own wife don't even belong to you. Your boss has lost his damn mind. - Really? From where I'm standing, it looks like you're the one that's lost their mind. Ah, just in time. - What the hell? - These two gentlemen would love to have you work with them. - The hell is going on, Rich? - Insider trading, asshole. - Is there anything you want me to do? - Yeah, have William's office cleant up? You have reached the voice mailbox of... - You okay? - Yeah. Yeah. I'll be fine. I gotta grab my jacket. I'll be back. - Remember you have a meeting in an hour with the lawyers. - Hey, how you doing, sir? - Hey, I'ma drive myself. You go ahead up to the office. - You know I can't do that. You gotta have me and Rich with you at all times. - Look Carlton, the security is not for me. It's for the people that think they might do something to me, all right? I'm good. Go 'head. - Please, boss. - Carlton, I said I'm good. Go ahead all right? - Baby! Baby! Malik, where you at? - What the fuck? - Fuck. Shit. Fuck. - Who the fuck are you? - Malik, who is this woman? - Malik, who the fuck is this bitch? Who is this woman? - I'm his wife bitch. - Your wife? Yeah. - But it's not, it's not what it looks like. - Oh it's not what it looks like? It looks like you in here not giving a fuck about our family, Malik. Jas. Really? Jas! Jas! - Don't touch me. - Jasmine, what are you doing? - Don't touch me! What am I doing? What are you doing? - Man, where is you going? - I'm going home to our two kids. You know the ones that look just like you, the ones that you haven't spent any time with because you're busy working. Bae! Jas, let me talk to you. Bae! Jas! Jas! Jas! Jas! - Was it worth it? What? Don't look so surprised. - Um. - What, my wife? What you covering up for? I already seen you naked. - I'm not. - So was it worth it? - No. - Why Jax? - I don't know. - Why did you do it? - Because, 'cause I'm a damn fool. - I'm glad you know you a goddamn fool! Ain't nobody gon' ever love you the way I do! What about Sam? What about the last past 10 years? You gon' throw that away over a piece of dick?! - It wasn't like that. - So this where you was fucking? This where you been meeting him? This where you was sucking his dick? You did suck his dick, right? Answer me! Did you suck his dick?! - Yes. Hey man, what the fuck is you doing in my crib, man? Hey, don't I know you? No, you don't know me. - Man, I do know you. What the fuck is you doing in my house, man? - You like fucking men's wives? What? You at a loss for words? - Baby, wake up please. Baby, wake up please. Baby, can you wake up? This I swear I didn't mean for this shit to happen. Please wake up. - Put your hands up! I said put your hands up! - I didn't do this shit, man. I didn't do this! - I said, put your hands up. I didn't do this man! I didn't do this! - What did you just do? Man, what was you thinking?! What you gon' tell Sam? Why did you have to make me do this?! Why did you mess around on me?! I wasn't good enough?! - Hello? Boss. You missed your meeting. Is everything all right? - Meet me at the house. Well, what about the meeting? - Just meet me at the house! Please! - Okay. - Okay. I'll be there. So you really gon' sit there and act like you didn't kill that woman? - I didn't! I told you I didn't touch her. - So why in the hell your neighbors tell us they heard you two arguing, huh? They heard you say you would kill her. - I would never say that, man. I'm a artist. I don't hurt people. - Wait so you don't kill people? No! - So dead people just tend to find their way into your home? I'm gonna assume that that's not her blood on you too, right? - Look it is. But I didn't put it there. Right. - Look, my partner doesn't believe you because you were the only person there alive. - No I wasn't. It was a man. It was a man there. - A man? You gotta give us more than that. Otherwise you fucking yourself. How did he look? - Like a man. - Just admit that you did this shit so I can go home to my husband. - Look, he had to be around 35 to 40 years. - Okay. And how tall was this mystery man? - I don't know, like 5'10 ", 5'11". I don't know. - Get the fuck outta here. - It was just confirmed. - Do you realize you just murdered one of Michigan's most wealthiest people? - Reed, what are you talking about? Fill me in. - The dead woman is Jaclyn Hewer. - Get the hell outta here. Did you know you were banging one of the richest women in Michigan? - Yeah. I guess. - You guess? You guess? Ni- I'll be right back. Johnson, come with me. Maybe Mr. Brown here can come up with the truth by the time we come back. - Look, I am telling the truth. Okay? I loved her. Man I- Me and her didn't have no problems. - You loved her? Aw, you loved her, but you had a wife. So like I said, you let us know when you ready to tell me the truth. Let's go. Man I don't believe anything that... I don't believe anything he's saying. He killed that woman in cold blood. Now we gotta find out why. - Well, what if he didn't do it? - What? You must be off your meds again. 'Cause if he didn't do it, why is all that blood on him, huh? If he didn't do it, why was there so many calls about the fight between them two? Come on Johnson. Please explain all of this to me. - You're my partner. If I have all the answers, you will have 'em as well. My gut is telling me that man did not kill that woman. - Yeah well I think your gut is wrong. - He said another man was there, right? - Right. - All I'm saying is maybe we should look into that. See if there's any truth to it. - Okay. Well let's go question him about the husband then. - What in the hell happened to you? - I killed my wife. - You what? Wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on. W-w-what happened? - I caught her at some dude house and I lost it. Damn, I fucking lost it, man. I killed my wife. Hey. Hey. - Man, what was I thinking? - Get yourself together first. All right? Carlton, take the car. Have it cleaned from top to bottom. All right? Make sure you switch the plates. Okay? Come on. We gotta get you inside and get you out of them clothes. Get a bag. Put everything that you're wearing inside that bag. Oh and I'll take care of it. What'd you kill her with? - Did anybody see you? - Only dude she was fucking. Anybody else? - No. I parked around the corner. He the only person I saw. - You got the address on you? Let me get it. - All right. I'm gonna go check the place out, make sure there aren't any cameras there, okay? - Rich, what am I gon' tell Sam? - You don't have to say anything, okay? You can't let anybody know that you know that she's dead. All right? Now the cops and Sam are both gonna be here soon and you have to put on the best goddamn performance of your life today. You understand me? - Yeah. I understand. - Let's go inside and get you out of them clothes. Mr. Brown, how long have you been seeing Jaclyn Hewer? - A few weeks. - Were you two having a sexual relationship? - Yeah. - And how did your wife feel about that? - Look, that's what I've been trying to tell y'all. My wife walked in on us, okay? I went chasing after her. We got to arguing. That's what the neighbors heard. When I came back in the building, I saw a man dripping in blood. When he left, I ran in there trying to save her, But she was already gone. Can you describe that man? - Look, he was like 5'10 " 5'11". Bald head. Looks like he wear suits all the time. Lil' preppy looking dude. Um, that's him! That's the dude that rubbed blood on me. That's him! - So he wiped blood on you? - Yes! That's what I've been trying to tell y'all. - Okay. We'll be back. We have to get a warrant now before he destroys all the evidence. - I guess your gut was right. - Let's go. - Officer Williams. - How we doing today, Rich? - I'm okay. How's that new daughter of yours? - Oh, beautiful man. The wife couldn't be happier. - That's... - Could've used a boy though. - Ah, couldn't we all, huh? Now you know what they say though? It is never too early to start a college. - I can't argue with that. - Have yourself a good night, Williams. - You too. - Look around. This place is a mess. But what's one thing you don't see? I don't know. What? - Fingerprints, all this blood, not a fingerprint, a boot print anywhere. - You are absolutely right. - He killed her and he thinks he's getting away with it. - He had to make a mistake. There is no perfect murder. - Look, I'm telling you I didn't do it. All right? It's the dude that's on TV. All right? He was coming outta my building, shirt bloody. His eyes had fire in it, man. He was gon' kill me. The only reason he ain't let that gun off 'cause he knew it would've been a wrap. Everybody would've seen him. - So are there any cameras in the building? Hey. I need you to go over to Malik's. Take a look around the building and tell me if there are any cameras that would've caught the other guy running. Police, we have a warrant to search the home and SUV. Can I help you? - We have a warrant to search the home. Excuse me, miss. - Mr. Hewer! Where is Adam Hewer? - He's upstairs. Mr. Hewer! - What's going on? And why the hell are y'all in my house? - I'm Detective Reed. This is my partner, Detective Johnson. Can we talk somewhere private? - What's going on? - Let's talk please. - Yeah. Okay. In here. - Dad is everything okay? - Yeah. Everything is okay, son. Debra, can you take him upstairs for me? - Yes sir. Come on baby. - Right this way. So what's going on? You got all these police in my house, scaring the hell outta my son. I hope y'all got a hell of a explanation for this. Where's your wife? - I don't know. She should be here soon. Why? - When and where did you last see her? - I don't know! Why?! What's going on?! - I'm the one asking the questions. - No you in my house. So y'all need to tell me what's going on. - Sorry to inform you, your wife's body was found. She was murdered. - What? That's not true. - Mr. Hewer, gonna need you to get off your phone. - I'm calling my wife! - Sir, I just told you she's dead. - Baby, pick up. Baby, pick up. - Mr. Hewer, she's dead. - No my fucking wife is not dead! Shut the hell up! - Mr. Hewer, what's, what's going on? Mr. Hewer, what's wrong? - Baby pick up. - Mr. Hewer, I told you she's dead. - No! She's not! - I'm sorry, Mr. Hewer. - What the... - Mr. Hewer. Mr Hewer! Mr. Hewer, it's gon' be okay. Just breathe. God got you covered. - What am I gon' tell Sam? - You gon' tell him that his mother loved him and that she's in heaven, okay? Come on. We gotta get back to the police. - Okay. Who did this to my wife? - Well, right now we have someone in custody. Who? - We can't give you that information. However, this person said you were there. - What? - What? - And also said you were the one who killed your wife. - Man, that's crazy. How's that even possible? - Where were you this afternoon? - I don't know what you talking about. - Why don't you write down everywhere you've been today? - How about I call my lawyer and y'all could deal with him? - How 'bout we arrest yo' ass for the murder of your wife? - Are you crazy? I wouldn't kill my wife! I love my wife! She's my everything! - Well, did you know that your everything was seeing another man? - Yes. We had a open relationship. - Hm. Do you have a girlfriend? - Yes he does. And Mrs. Hewer knew about it so why would he kill her? - Are you the one seeing him? - Goodness no. - What are they doing with my clothes? - Detective? - We're taking 'em. Now what car did you drive today? - The Tahoe. Why? - Hm. Take the Tahoe too. - Yes ma'am. - Thanks. - Look, I don't think I should say anything else to y'all until my lawyer gets here. Am I under arrest? 'Cause if not, I'm done talking to y'all. - Well you not under arrest, but we are taking all of them cars out there. - I don't care about none of that. I just want my wife back! - I hear you. We all good here? - I think so. Okay. Let's wrap it up. Mr. Hewer, we will be in touch. - Yeah. Okay. - You did it. Didn't you? - Excuse me? - You killed your wife, didn't you? It's all over you. You murdered your wife and I'm gonna prove it. - I don't got nothing else to say to you until my lawyer gets here. - I wouldn't expect anything less. I'll see you soon. - You get in touch with my wife? - Yes, I did. And to say that she's angry is an understatement. - I'm sitting here facing murder while the woman I really love is out there dying slowly. - Look, I get it. And I understand, but I gotta ask, did you do it? - Really? I really gotta answer that question? - Yes, because I need you to assure me that I'm fighting for the life of an innocent man. - That son of a bitch did it. I just know it - Now you see what I mean? The gut never lies. - How do we prove it? - We have to see if the clothes come back clean along with the vehicle. If he really did it, he wouldn't have had time to clean everything up and get rid of his clothes. We do know one of 'em murdered her, but if we have the wrong one, the other one's gonna have ample enough time to clean up all his mistakes. - Let's go. - Excuse me. - Excuse me? Is that one of the Hewer cars? - Yes. Why? - Because if it is, we need to seize it. - Oh. Have at it. Nice catch. - Hm. - Let's go. - Captain's gonna have our heads for this. - Hey son. Can I talk to you for a minute? - Yes. What's wrong? - I really don't know how to tell you this. - Tell me what? - It's about your mom. - Dad, you're scaring me. Yeah. I'm scared to tell you. - Tell me what? - God called your mom home today. - Wait, what do you mean? - Your mom is in heaven son. She died today. - What happened? Look, I don't know. But, son I promise you everything is gonna be okay. And I promise you that I'm gon' be here for you. Okay? - Dad, I don't know what I'm gonna do without her. I'm gonna miss her. She's still gon' be here son right here in your heart. And whenever you need to talk to her, you just talk. She's in heaven, son. She gon' hear you. It's okay. Great. Now the whole world knows that you're here for murder. - What are my kids gon think? Mom about to throw a fit. Seriously? You worried about your mommy having a fit? Malik, you got much bigger things to worry about than that right now. This is your life. - I know that! The hell I'm even talking about? - Look, I'm just simply trying to say that we have to find some kind of proof that you didn't do this. - Look. Ask my wife. I was with her. All right? We got into a argument. I chased her out of the building. When I came back in, Jaclyn was already dead. I keep telling all y'all the same story. Nobody listening. I'm only guilty of two things here. - Yeah and what's that? - Cheating on my wife and sleeping with a married woman. - Me and my kids just watched the fucking news and my husband is here for murder? He didn't kill nobody! - Ma'am calm down. What's your husband's name? - His name is Malik Brown. He's an artist. He's supposed to have killed some rich bitch. He didn't kill that bitch. She was still alive when he chased me outta his studio. - Okay, well the detectives working that case aren't here right now, but if you wanna have a seat, I'll find out when they're back, okay? - Look, give me your wife's address. Because at this point, she may be the only person that could help you. - Wouldn't hold your breath. - Malik, look, she loves you and I'm sure she wouldn't wanna see you go to prison for a murder you didn't do. Look, just sit tight and let me take care of this. Excuse me. Are you Mrs. Brown? - And who are you? - I'm Patrice Gatz. I believe I'm your husband's lawyer. - Malik? - Yes. I was actually on my way over to your house. - I'm here trying to figure out why the fuck my husband is being charged with murder. My house is a fucking zoo. My kids is distraught. My phone won't stop ringing. My husband did not kill anyone! - Okay. Can you hold on a second for me, please? Excuse me? Yes? I'm Patrice Gatz, Malik Brown's attorney. Is there somewhere that I can speak to his wife in private please? - Oh yes ma'am. I can take you there. - Thank you. Miss Brown, come with me please. - All right. Truck is clean. Everything is all good fellas. - Are you sure? I mean, I know there was a lot blood. I don't know what I'ma do without her. What's the plan? - You gotta get yourself together, boss. Everything is taken care of. - That's what we're here for. To protect you and the company. - Look, I appreciate that fellas, but I seen all those crime shows and I know it's no such thing as a perfect murder. - Ah, but there is such thing as a perfect cover up. Hm. Speaking of which, how did you find her? - We share locations. I always knew where she was. - Damn. Did you take any calls? - What? - Did you take any calls or use the internet for any reason? - I used the map app. - Fuck man. - Right? All right. Gimme your phone. Use your work phone, all right? If anybody asks, Jax had your phone. - But I have my phone up until now. What do I say when they ask me about that? - Nothing. Nothing at all. You say nothing to nobody. - Won't that make me look guilty? - You already look guilty. Have you seen the news? They said she was messing around with her lover and all of a sudden, she ended up dead. Now they tryna blame her billionaire husband. - I can't believe this. Sam is gonna hate me if he think I hurt his mother. - That's why we gon' make sure that motherfucker take the blame for it. - Listen, these charges that they have against Malik are serious. So is there anything that you know that could help him? I mean anything? - Yes, that man that was on the news, he is the one that did this. I seen him leaving Malik's studio with a blue shirt on and it was bloody and he had something in his hand and he was also, he was crying. And then I seen him hop into a black truck. And now I'm being told that Malik is 'bout to be charged for the murder of his wife? I just, I don't understand, like Malik wouldn't kill anyone. - And are you willing to write this out in a statement? - Hell yeah, I am. I love Malik and yes, he hurt me, but I still love my husband. - Good. You know, I'll be right back. Okay? - Man, I still can't believe she was really cheating on you. Are you okay? - No, I'm not okay! I'm fucked up! And the bad part is I love her so much. Why she messed around on me? What was it about him? - Look, boss, you don't need to be thinking about that kind of stuff right now, all right? Go get yourself some rest. We'll meet you in the morning, okay? Let's go. - I'ma get no sleep tonight. - So you mean to tell me you saw Adam Hewer in a bloody outfit? - Yes, I seen that clown in a bloody outfit and he was crying. - You're Malik's wife. Why should we believe you? - Why should you believe me? Because I have it on my phone. - Show me. - Here. The fuck? - Was that him? - Yeah. That's that nigga. - Damn. I mean, you know it's him, but you can't really see his face. Damn it. - I told you it was a gut call. That son of a bitch took his wife's life. Mrs. Brown, thank you. - Thank me? So are y'all gonna let my husband outta that fucking jail cell? - I can't, but I am gonna check the evidence to make sure none of her blood shows up. - But y'all see that it's not Malik. - But you don't see his face. We can know it's him, but with no concrete proof, our hands are tied. It's nothing we can do. - No. What y'all can do is let my husband out. - Now calm down. - Calm down? - Now you want us to let him go, right? But he has her blood all over him, so it's not that easy. - Y'all two see this is clearly some bullshit. - Nah. What's some bullshit is he had a dead woman in his place. That's the thing that's some bullshit. Furthermore, I feel bad for him, but we're doing our job. We're doing everything we can to make sure the right person pays for this. - Make sure you two do y'all fucking job right. Do you hear me? Get outta my way. - Mom, I'm so sorry, mom. - You son of a bitch. I know you killed my daughter and I'm gon' prove it if it's the last thing I do. - Can we come in? - Look, I told you two everything yesterday. - We just have a few more questions. - Come in. How can I help you? - You know Mr. Hewer murdered his wife. So why are you covering for him? - I'm not covering for anybody. Matter of fact, I don't have a reason to lie to you. - Looks to me like you're moving. - I am. The Hewers bought me a home so I'm moving in and unpacking. - Look, we know you're lying to us and you will go to jail for it. Is that what you really want? Do you really wanna go to jail for a man who murdered his own wife in cold blood? - Look, I told you all I know. And what I know is that man did not murder his wife. So if you two can excuse me, I got things to do. - How long have you worked for them? - Why? - Because is this him? You know it's him 'cause he murdered her. He killed her and now there's an innocent man in jail right now, worried that he's gonna do time for her death. - I told you he was at home. - He murdered her. Now stop lying for him. - He was with my daughter. - Your daughter? - Yes. - Yeah. Okay. - Look, she works for them. - And what's your daughter's name? - Nikki Sloan. - Where is she now? - She's at the Hewers'. She's their nanny. She's the woman he's been sleeping with. And before you even ask, yes, Mrs. Hewer knew all about it. Matter of fact, they've been together numerous of times. - You know what? You the worst mother I ever met in my life. 'Cause you know he killed her and you covering for him. - It's time for you to go. - Hello? - Hey babe. Who, who, who you there with? - Nobody, Ma. What's going on? Listen, baby. Adam actually killed Jaclyn. - Oh my God. What the fuck? He's downstairs talking to his lawyer right now. You want me to take Sammy and go to the police? No. I want you to fuck him. - What? - Matter of fact, I need you to make him your man. - Are you crazy? I'm not doing that. - Oh yes, you are gon' do it. Baby, that man is 'bout to be a billionaire. Baby he could change our lives forever and we will never have another opportunity like this. - I'm hungry. Can you make me something to eat? - Mama, I am not doing that. - Baby, we will lose everything we have. Okay? If that man goes to jail. Now he just may beat this case, but he may go to jail. Nikki, we know how much that man love his wife. He was the best husband to her. We talked about it all the time, but baby, we will never have another opportunity for this man to change our world, okay? - Look, I gotta make him something to eat real quick. I'll call you back in a minute. - Nikki, you don't want that baby growing up without his parents, right? And besides, you can't even have kids. - Why would you bring that up right now? - Because we will never have this chance again. And this is your opportunity to have the world. Baby, a good man, a beautiful home, and a son that you can raise to be great. - Mom, I gotta go. I call you back in a minute. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. The fuck? - Did you kill her? - No. Looking at the three of you guys, I think you're lying. I think you did and I have to have complete honesty or I can't help you. In fact, I won't help you if you lie to me. - Look, he's one of the only lawyers I trust in this area, all right? - Yeah, I did it. - All right. Now we're talking. We gotta get you an airtight alibi. What did you tell the detectives when you talked to 'em? - I didn't. - Good and here's the thing. The police have to charge somebody with murdering your wife. Right now, the news is going crazy. I mean, it's the top story in the country. From here on out, you don't say anything to anyone, especially the police. And that goes for all of you. I'm the only one that'll have any contact with 'em. That's gonna cost you about $500,000 if this goes to trial. - Well hopefully I don't even have to go to trial. - Right. Exactly. So just let us know whatever you need us to do. And I'll take care of it. - I will. - Come with me. - Just a minute! Hello, can I help you? We're here to see Mr. Hewer. - Well, he's actually in a meeting right now. - I don't give a damn. You tell him we're here. - What the hell is going on now? This is starting to be harassment. - I'm representing Mr. Hewer right now. Anything you say to him has to be done in my presence. Understood? - Yes sir. But you here now. So I just need one thing answered. Mr. Hewer, where were you when your wife was murdered? - You don't have to answer that. - Look. He was with me at my place, making love. That's where we always at. - So you just gon' lie for him? Your mother put you up to this, didn't she? - No, I would never do that. I actually love him. - On your way. If they come back, let me know. - Will do. Thank you. - Nah don't thank me. Thank my mama. And most of all, thank your son, 'cause I'll do anything for that little boy. - Look, I swear I'ma do right by him. - No you gon' do right by all of us and you bet not hurt me. - Consider it done. - You know she's lying, right? - There's nothing we can do about it. You have to let it go. All the evidence is pointing at Mr. Brown. I guess that's karma, his punishment, for sleeping with that man's wife. - Still not right. - Malik Brown, you have been accused of the murder of Jaclyn Hewer. How do you plead? - I didn't do it. I didn't kill her. - Miss Gatz, please get your client under control. - Calm down. My apologies, your honor. My client pleads not guilty. - People of the state, how are you on bail? - Mr. Brown beat his mistress to death because she was leaving him and telling his wife. - That bitch lying! I didn't do that! - Mrs. Gatz, please inform your client he is not at a backyard barbecue at his mama's house. This is a courtroom, my courtroom. And if he doesn't get his self under control, I will have him hog tied and muzzled. - Again, my apologies, your honor. - Mrs. Fields, please continue. - Thank you, your honor. We're asking for bail of $1,000,000. - That is crazy. Your honor, Mr. Brown does not have that kind of money. - That's the point. Mr. Brown, your bail is set at $1,000,000. - Fuck you. - Well, that's something you won't be doing for a while. At least not with women. Court's adjourned. - I did it. All right. Now we talkin'. We gotta get you an airtight alibi. - 911. - What's your emergency? - I know who killed my mother, Jaclyn Hewer. This is her son, Samuel Hewer. I have video evidence.
