[instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [church bell tolling] [music continues] Oh, hello, everybody. Welcome to my village of Columba. You're just in time for the beauty contest. Every year they hang the pictures.. ...and every year I paint mustaches. And every year they blame that son of a cheesemaker Pepe Gonzales. That's me. And every year Elena Cantu wins. But she's not the prettiest. No, Maria is. Maria of the River Road. But her picture will never hang here. The women won't allow it. Elena would like to marry my friend, Alejandro Castillo. I have noticed her rolling the eye at him but I have also noticed that he doesn't roll back. So it looks like Alejandro, Ruben, the candy-maker, and I we are destined to be bachelors. As for myself, I find that very interesting way to live. Uh-oh, here comes the law. Wait. See what happens when he discovers what I've done. Hasta luego. See you soon. [instrumental music] (male #1) 'People of Columba, there is a sickness here.' All our young people have it. They caught it from their parents. I'm talking again about this feud between us and our neighbors in Milpa Verde. Does the.. Psst! '...Don Romulo Balderas depend on..' What is it, Don Inocente? Forgive me, father, but I must talk with the professor. It is very urgent. Urgent enough to interrupt? Just for a moment. Professor, don't keep the police force waiting. What is so urgent? Professor, have you got an eraser? Eraser? Come on. [bell tolling] That was close. Come on. (Ruben) 'Pecans, delicious molasses hearts, pink coconut.' Pecans, delicious, malicious hearts, pink coconut. Candy, Little Doctor? Professor? Where is that son of a cheesemaker? You'd best tell your friend Pepe to leave town. - Again? - Again. I'll cut off his ears for this! - Good morning, Dona Fela. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Elenita. I think I'd prefer Elena with a beard. [Dona Fela shrieks] 'Don Inocente!' Did I miss one? [indistinct chatter] What's wrong, Dona Fela? This! (Don Inocente) 'Oh!' One moment ago it wasn't here. That Pepe Gonzales would pay for this. Ay! Maria's picture is in the contest. What's this? What's this? Maria of the River Road in our contest? It's an insult for every woman in Columba to enter this nameless creature from the river bank with our decent girls. Don Nacho, I demand that you take it down at once! But now that it's up, I-I can't. You are the mayor. If you can't, I can. - Mama! Mama! Mama! - Wait, Dona Fela. This problem is for the contest committee. Calm yourself, mama. Alejandro Castillo is chairman. What's there to worry about? Look, you gentlemen, I repeat, Maria's photograph was properly entered, according to your own rules. If we disqualify her now, after the votes have been cast every town in the valley will say we don't know what democracy means. But if she wins, the women will kill us. They are waiting out there like vultures. Let us see what the ballot say. After all, no married man is going to risk his wife's anger by voting for Maria. So there's really no need to worry. For you, no. Have you finished counting the votes, Little Doctor? You should be proud, Alejandro. Seven votes were cast for Elena Cantu. Seven? Out of how many votes cast? (Little Doctor) 'Three hundred even.' That leaves 293. Precisely, and all of them for Maria of the River Road. Well, there it is, gentlemen. But this Maria can't be allowed to win. Why not? She was voted the most beautiful. Just as you were voted mayor. [band music] Silence, hold the world. Our chairman is about to make the presentation. [applause] Grand Mayor, gentlemen and ladies it gives me great honor to announce that the new queen who has been selected is none other than that exquisite creature of grace and charm Elena Cantu. [applause] Grand Mayor.. ...crown your queen. [instrumental music] [instrumental music] My dearest. My golden Maria, you won! You won! Elena Cantu wears the crown, but you won. Oh, why did you enter my picture, foolish one? Did you really think they'd let me be queen? No, but I wanted to make the whole village admit that you are the most beautiful. As long as you say it, it's enough for me. Let's leave this valley, Maria. There is Spain, France, the whole world. Far from here. We could be always together. Your father's been talking to you again about marrying Elena Cantu. [sighs] You read me like a book. But I couldn't marry any other woman. Not even to please my father. I understand your father. He's old and you're all he has. He wants you to take his place one day as the head of the House Castillo. You're the only woman I'll ever love. Elena Cantu means nothing to me. It would be a marriage of families as your father would wish. A Castillo cannot marry a nameless one like me. Don't talk like that. To me that means nothing. One day, when it cannot hurt my father we'll be two people together. I promise you that. Say it over again. Over and over. I'm such a coward and I need the words. My darling. Hey, tears. And you, the winner of the beauty contest? [chuckles] We should celebrate, I want to shout "Maria the most beautiful belongs to Alejandro Castillo." Oh, what a charge you are. People need only one tiny hint to suspect the truth about us. No one suspected that I entered your photograph. - Guess who they are blaming? - Not Pepe Gonzales? - Uh-huh. - Oh, poor, wild one. - But he's innocent! - Of this, yes. [gasps] The women will tear him apart. They'd have to find him first. - You know where he's hiding? - Of course. In the witch's hut. Tia Magdalena is probably the only woman in town who doesn't think she should have won the beauty contest. [laughs] And I am the only man who can kiss the real queen. [instrumental music] Enter. [cat meows] [whispers] Pepe? Pepe Gonzales, are you still here? - Is it safe to leave yet? - Not if you value your life. The women are out looking for you. All this over a few mustaches? The mustaches they would forgive but, mad man what devil was in you to put Maria's picture in the contest? Mari.. Oh, I would never do this. They think you did it. Pepe, you have a bad name for tricks. Oh, dear, what can I do? Make a hero of yourself. Everyone forgives heroes. Magnificent idea. Ruben, jump in the river and I will save you. - Yes. - But, Pepe, you can't swim. U-well, then lie down on the railroad tracks and just as the train is about to cut off-- Oh, you'll be out somewhere painting mustaches. [knock on door] 'Tia Magdalena.' That's the policeman's wife. Hide. [whispers] It's stuck! - Enter. - Tia, I wanna.. So you are here. Where is that shameless Pepe Gonzales? - Hiding, senora. - He better be. Well, senora, what can I do for you? I want a charm, to make my husband answer a question in his sleep. Put this owl's claw on your husband's chest and ask as many questions as you like. But remember, he will answer only one truthfully. And how will I know which one is the truth? Wake him up and ask him. That will be two pesos. And tell that worthless friend of yours we're gonna grind his bones for soup! What a price to pay for being innocent. Ruben, why didn't you bring some candy with you? Oh, I always carry some for emergencies. For a molasses heart I read your cards. Oh, what would be interesting in my fortune? Ah, who knows. Cut. That's it. The bones of Don Romulo. That's it! Do you realize that the bones of our valley's greatest poet belonged here, where he was born? Instead of in Milpa Verde where all he did was die? What bad manner that town had! To bury him first and then tell us he was dead. Ruben, if we brought those bones back to Columba we would be true heroes. "We?" What have I to do with it? Surely, you wouldn't have me do it all by myself? Aren't you a patriot? If the men of Milpa Verde caught me I'd be a dead patriot. Well, if my best friend deserts me.. ...I'll have to risk it alone. Of course. If a friend asked me as a friend. [laughs] A thousand thanks, Tia. Wait a moment, Ruben. Don't you want to know your destiny? Why not? The road to Milpa Verde leads to Mexico City. That's impossible. Mexico City's in the opposite direction. What do cards care about geography? Ah, come on! Come on! Don Romulo's bones are waiting. [instrumental music] [intense music] [doorknob rattling] [music continues] No, that's not good. Hit it, hit it. Hey, that's my thumb! [clattering] [dramatic music] How beautiful you are. Permit me to silence you properly. Help mm! [screams] Ow! [instrumental music] She got away from me. Come on. After him! Get on your horses! Hurry up, this way! [intense music] Ruben, hurry up! [music continues] Pepe, Pepe! Pepe, hurry up! [music continues] [music continues] We lost them. [instrumental music] You should have told me about this sooner. Well, it's a simple headache. A headache that lasts for two weeks isn't simple. Um, just to be on the safe side why don't you go into Mexico City and see a specialist? You make it sound serious. When you're a country doctor you learn to take nothing for granted. [knock on door] I wonder who's having a baby at this hour. [knocking continues] You! What have you been up to now, Pepe Gonzales? Me? Nothing! It's Ruben. His arm has broken itself. - How did it happen? - Well-- Uh, he, uh, fell off a horse. Come on, sit down, my boy. Let me see it. It's a bad fracture. I'll set it for you. And Alejandro will take you to have it X-rayed. Yes, I am driving to Mexico City tomorrow. Mexico City? So Tia Magdalena was right. The cards did know their geography. [instrumental music] - How's your arm, friend? - Oh, they're finished with me. - What are they doing to you? - Um, nothing. They just want to take some more pictures. I'm sorry, Ruben. I won't be able to take you home until Monday. Oh, that's alright, there's a bull fight tomorrow and worth seeing. The gypsy Gitanillo de Torrano is fighting. Oh, I lost my enthusiasm for the bulls. But I'd like to buy you a ticket. No, thanks. A friend of mine has a concession there. He'll get me in to sell my candy. Then, good fortune. And to you, Alejandro. [instrumental music] [cheering] [band music] Tomas, what is wrong? Why don't they come out? You know these gypsies. Gitanillo's superstitious. His luck isn't here. [audience chattering] It will start now. I'm sorry. Why, there are tears in you. You, out of the way! [band music] [applause] Who was that woman? I told you. Gitanillo's luck. Since when do toreros let the women watch them fight? This one is his sister. He won't fight unless she's present. He believes as longs as she keeps the innocence of an angel no bull will get him. Crazy gypsy superstition. [applause] [music continues] [applause continues] [indistinct chatter] My country man, yesterday in the arena you showed the true glory-- - Thank you very much. - I, who've seen the great ones. Pocelito Manolette, now bow to a new master. Fine lace, senorita. - I also tell fortunes. - Not today. Thank you. The manager will pay you. Pecans delicious molasses hearts.. ...sweet coconut. What are you doing? I would like some of this candy, Gitanillo. Looks clean enough. How much? It's a gift. Thank you. I don't want you to talk to street vendors. Order supper in your room and stay there. (male #2) Master of the noble art of killing the bull. Your gloriou.. (male #3) Where are you going, matador? You mind my business, not my private affairs. Remember, we are leaving early in the morning. If you went up the backstairs, no one would see you. Her room number is 603. [instrumental music] Forgive me, senorita, but I must talk with you. I'm not allowed to talk to any man. But you're going away in the morning. I must know more about you. Please, don't be afraid of me. I'm only afraid that you will be seen. We can't talk here. [music continues] - Who are you? - My name is Ruben. - That's a good name. - It's in the Bible. He was the oldest brother of Joseph. Where do you come from? See the two volcanoes? My village is far on the other side in a long valley. With a river running through it. It sounds so beautiful, so peaceful. I've lived in cities all my life. Cities where the bulls are killed. I know you only as Gitanillo's sister. What is your name? It's Lola. That's from Dolores. It means sorrow. I don't want to think about sorrow now. What's your village like? Are the people there kind like you? Kind and mean, good and bad. Like any village anywhere. How did you hit your arm? - Were you in a fight? - Just a fall from horse. I do not fight very much. Gitanillo says all men fight. He thinks all men are cruel.. ...and ruthless. I think I could be ruthless if I really wanted something. And for the first time in my life, I do. I want you to love me. No, Ruben. Please. You must never see me again. I'm afraid for you. Alejandro, come on in and have a drink. I invite you. - With pleasure, friend. - Let's go. Pachito, whatever my friend wants, serve him, huh? - Give me a beer. - Why not? - Hey, hi. - Hi, friend. - What goes with you? - Nothing. - To your health. - Your wealth. And time to enjoy them. You better take care of your health, Pepe Gonzales. The women are still furious with you. Why won't anyone believe I am innocent? Why? Comfort yourself, Pepe. I believe you. Muchachos, do you know that old song, "Farewell My Heart?" Oh, no, no. That's for broken-hearted lovers. - Not for me. - Are you in love again? This is the love with salt in it. Ah, that's what you say every time. But she's the first girl who ever bit me. And if that isn't love, what is? You mean that girl from Milpa Verde who caught us in the cemetery? I thought she bit you in self-defense. Companions, it's easy to perceive that neither of you has ever experienced the noble passion. It's like a terrible sickness. You can't sleep, you can't eat. My own cheese doesn't count. With every girl in town looking calf-eyed at you why do you have to choose one for Milpa Verde? The melon you steal is always the juiciest. And how'd you manage to court her? Oh, I haven't yet. But I'm starting tonight. In spite of the feud? Maybe I can settle it. (in unison) How? The people of Milpa Verde love cheese as much as we do, true? I am going to take her a present of a big, rich, beautiful Gonzales cheese. Well, they haven't tasted that since they buried Don Romulo. Watch out or you'll be buried there with him. That's no danger, no. Eufemia.. Isn't that a beautiful name? Eufemia. - She won't give me away. - No. She gave you away the last time. But not this time. I've written her a love letter. And set it to music. Maestro, let me borrow this, huh? When I sing it to her, she'll fall at my feet. - This we must hear. - Even your hearts will melt. ♪ Because I held you in my arms one lovely night ♪ ♪ Eufemia ♪ ♪ And the twinkle in your eyes put all the stars to shame ♪ ♪ Because I kissed you and I felt my heart take flight ♪ ♪ Eu-u-ufemia ♪ ♪ I would like to know you better ♪ ♪ So I've written you this letter ♪ ♪ Just to tell you I adore you ♪ ♪ And that Pepe is my name ♪ [instrumental music] ♪ I love you dearly ♪ ♪ Even when I close my eyes ♪ ♪ I see your lovely face so clearly ♪ ♪ Oh could you love me ♪ ♪ Though I know I am not worthy of you ♪ ♪ And you're far above me? ♪ ♪ Each time I breathe your name I find it leaves me weak ♪ ♪ Eu-u-u-ufemia ♪ ♪ And I get the strangest tingling up and down my spine ♪ ♪ You are so beautiful that I can hardly speak ♪ ♪ Ay Eufemia ♪ ♪ There is one thing that could free me ♪ ♪ If you just agree to see me ♪ ♪ Or to hold you in my arms once more ♪ ♪ Would make me feel just fine ♪ ♪ Oh could you love me ♪ ♪ Ahh-ha-ha-ay ♪ ♪ Though I know I am not worthy of you ♪ ♪ And you're far above me ♪ ♪ Ay ay ay ♪ ♪ Each time I breathe your name I find it leaves me weak ♪ ♪ Eu-u-u-ufemia ♪ ♪ Eufemia ♪ ♪ And I get the strangest tingling up and down my spine ♪ ♪ You are so beautiful that I can hardly speak ♪ ♪ Ay Eu-u-u-ufemia ♪ ♪ Eufemia ♪ ♪ Now my letter it is ending but the love that I am sending ♪ ♪ Will go on and on forever till Eufemia you are mine ♪ ♪ Ay ♪ ♪ Eufemia ♪♪ [orchestral music] [applause] [instrumental music] [chickens clucking] [music continues] What's wrong, papa? - "What's wrong?" - Shh! I invite every bachelor in Milpa Verde and you sit with the chaperones? Why don't you dance with Napoleon Lopez? I don't like to dance with him. Eufemia, you mustn't be so critical. All your girlfriends are married. You want to die an old maid? No, papa, I've been praying that the right man will come along. One who was handsome and daring.. ...romantic. Ah, you've been reading another book! If you just roll the eye at Napoleon Lopez he'd propose to you this very night. But I don't love him. What has love got to do with choosing a proper husband? Napoleon Lopez is not only a graduate bookkeeper but he has a fine appreciation of fighting cocks. Now you go back in there and dance with Napoleon. - Enjoy yourself! - Yes, papa. [rooster crowing] Alright, calm yourself, Satan. Uh, take my advice never have a daughter. [crowing] There's no doubt you were born in this town. [music continues] [music continues] Who is that stranger? I don't know. Good evening, senor. This is your host. Homero Calderon, Mayor of Milpa Verde. Ah, Ruben Alejandro at your service. We're always glad to welcome strangers here. Except of course, those sons of mountain witches from Columba. [laughs] You have many friends here in Milpa Verde? Uh, n-no. My last visit was rather brief. Oh, what a pity. You like cock fights? The very reason why I dare intruding your hospitality. Everyone has heard of Don Homero Calderon breeder of the finest fighting cocks in the republic. - Too much praise, senor. - Oh, no, no. - I too raise a number of birds. - Oh. But unfortunately, I like your talent for training them. Your glass is empty, senor. Let me fill it for you. You will drink a toast to my beautiful daughter Eufemia. Incidentally, the man who wins her hand will also win my beautiful black Satan. Let me get you some of my private wine. Thank you but first, will you permit me the honor of a dance with your charming daughter? - I should be honored. - Thank you. Such good manners. And he also raises fighting cocks. [applause] With her father's consent. What impudence. I don't even remember meeting you. I'm sure your foot remembers my ankle. How dare you come here! The bee must return to the honey of your lips. [instrumental music] - My arms love to hold you. - Don't say such things. You're even more graceful than the girls-- - Don't mention that word. - What word? Columba. I've only to tell them your name and they'll tear you to pieces. - What is your name? - Pepe Gonzales. Not the wild one who paints mustaches? Aren't you afraid someone might recognize you? To be so near you is worth any risk. [music continues] Who is that rooster? His name is Ruben Alejandro. Alejandro? That's a peculiar last name. No, Napoleon, don't be jealous. He comes from a very fine family. Hmph! Play the birthday song. [singing in foreign language] Much happiness on this day, my dear. - Happy birthday, senorita. - Happy birthday. - Many more days like this. - Happy birthday. Happy birthday. [woman gasp] Play something lively, will you? [upbeat music] They are all watching us. You danced me right into a scandal. You're truly a wild one! Oh, but I'm willing to be tamed. If you really like me, please go. Not until you promise to let me see you again. That's impossible. Have you forgotten the recent feud between us? Not between you and me. Which is your window? - To my room? - Yes. - I won't tell you. - Why not? Why should a man from Columba needs to know my room is in the back near the corral of the roosters. The jewel of a prospect. This is a jewel of a cheese. Only the best Toluca cheese for my daughter's birthday. Leave some for the guests, brother-in-law. This is no cheese from Toluca. - Of course, it is. - Mm-mm. I recognize the savor. Oh, where does it come from? Ask the cowboy on his horse in Jalisco. Ask the soldier on the bridge of Laredo. 'Ask the sailor on his ship at Veracruz.' I'm asking you! Who makes the finest goat cheese in Mexico? The family Gonzales. [gasps] A Columba? - How did it get here? - The stranger. Ay! Where is that devil from Columba? (all) Columba? [indistinct murmuring] [yelling] Ay-yi-yi-yi! 'Aa-hi-hi-hi-hi!' Science has come a long way. Imagine, Alejandro with a little flash of light, we see right through the bone. Yes. And what do you see, Little Doctor? Sit down, my boy. I have never regretted that I became a doctor. Every time I heal the sick every time I bring a baby into the world I feel that I'm close to God. But with all our science, there are times when a doctor is...just a little man and helpless. Then the news is bad? Alejandro, my boy I brought you into the world. You are close to my heart. Not even...an operation? No, for it's too deep. How long have I? A few months. Maybe a year. These things are in the hands of God. Will I have a warning? Blindness. And the end. Thank you for telling me the truth, Little Doctor. You will speak of this to no one. - But your father-- - My father is old. He couldn't do anything but grieve. It's a heavy burden for you to carry along. I'm not alone, Little Doctor. I'm not alone. If you were my wife, they would have to accept you. And if we had a son.. I've wanted your son.. ...but he would be your son only as long as you are here. After, he'd be the son of Maria of the River Road. He would be our legitimate son. From an illegitimate mother. Oh, Alejandro, I couldn't do that to your son. There is so little time left. Why'd we trouble with the whole world? There is only the two of us. From the very beginning there's always been a third one with us. Your father. Everything we planned was always in the future when he wouldn't be here to hate us. But now time is against us and you must do as he wants. - Marry Elena Cantu. - I don't want her son! - It's your son I want! - But we cannot do as we want. You must do as you must. You will marry Elena Cantu. And have a son. How can you love me and plan for me to have a son with another woman? Is the smell of death so strong upon me that you say these things? Please don't say things like that, please. Darling, darling.. Forgive me. I don't know what I'm saying anymore. What shall I do, Maria? If I were not here if there were nobody what would you do? As my father wishes. Then you must do it now. Because I am nobody... except to you. [upbeat music] [speaking in foreign language] Oh, good afternoon. Don Carlos, Alejandro. - Won't you join us? - Delighted. Is it the sight of me that makes you frown so? No, but there are things that I must say to you. - Oh? - And I'm troubled. About how to say them. Well, let me help you. Is it about...love? No. But it is about marriage. Mother, he's just asked me to marry him. Oh! My boy, it's what I've lived for. With your permission, my father. Will you walk with me around the plaza, Elena? Three times around? [speaking in foreign language] Did you see them, companion? Alejandro has finally nibbled the cheese, eh? How fortunate to be able to marry the one you love. [sighs] How fortunate indeed. [crackers bursting] [bell tolling] [indistinct chatter] Goodbye, Elena. - Goodbye, darling. - Alejandro, my son. - Goodbye. - I got it! Goodbye. [bell tolling] [indistinct chattering] [whistling] [guitar music] Hey, you down there! What are you up to? Uh, forgive me, senor, I am only a poor musician who's been hired to serenade a senorita of this house. You! Go away. (Don Homero) 'Who hired you?' - Who hired me? - Napoleon Lopez. Somebody called Napoleon Lopez. He, uh, found me in a saloon, senor. Oh, he must be really serious to be spending money on serenades. ♪ Because I held you in my arms ♪ ♪ One lovely night ♪ ♪ Will you let me in Eufemia? ♪ Certainly not, what are you thinking? Of holding you close in my arms again. ♪ And the twinkle in your eyes ♪ ♪ Put all the stars to shame ♪ Have you no shame? Only love for you. ♪ Because I kissed you ♪ ♪ And I felt my heart take flight ♪ Papa should recognize you.. ♪ Would you wait for me Eufemia? ♪ What's a poor girl to do? ♪ There is one thing that could free me ♪♪ Let me taste your lips again. If I do, will you go back to Columba? It depends on the kiss. - Keep singing. - Not until you kiss me. (Don Homero) 'What's going on down there?' Is that musician short-changing Napoleon? I only stopped to wet my whistle, senor. Well, wet it and get along with it. ♪ If you just agree to see me ♪ ♪ Or to hold you in my arms once more ♪ ♪ Would make me feel just fine ♪♪ Mmm, Pepe. But you must go now. No, come back to Columba with me. Father Zacaya will marry us. Without my father's consent? I wouldn't do such a wicked thing. No, Pepe, as long as the feud last.. ...there is no hope for us. [singing in foreign language] Oh, it's that fellow with the glasses. He's bringing some musicians with him. Well, I certain sure that must be Napoleon-- And just what does this mean to you? It's not time to turn your eyes green. Go on, hide. [singing continues] [chickens clucking] What's going on down there? Something's disturbing the fighting cocks. Perhaps they don't like the singing, papa. [singing continues] So, now you bring six more. This is indeed an honor. Oh, no honor too great for the father of the gracious Eufemia. Come to the front door, Napoleon. My house is yours. Thank you, sir. [singing continues] [chicken clucking] Eufemia! Bring the musicians some wine. - Yes, papa. - Come in, my boy. Come in. I want you to see my beautiful black Satan. Pepe. - Pepe, where are you? - 'This way, my young friend.' Wherever you are, be careful. They're coming. Ay! Satan, my beautiful black Satan! What's wrong, Don Homero? It's gone. Look! [singing continues] Good morning, senor. Where can I find the priest? That's me. What do you want, child? [whispers] I'm from Milpa Verde. Be right down. Why come to me? Couldn't you go to the priest of your own parish? I couldn't, not after what Pepe Gonzales has done. What's that Pepe been up to now? Oh, father, if he comes to Milpa Verde again something dreadful will happen to him. (Ruben) 'Where are you, Father Zacaya?' Back here, Ruben. Wait for me on the porch, huh? You're leaving again? Gitanillo is fighting in the capital tomorrow. I don't understand the sudden passion you've acquired for bull fights. I'll tell you all about it in my next confession. Look, father, Tia Magdalena painted the witch's sign on my tray. But I don't think it'll work unless you bless it. Better I bless you. All that counts is what's in your heart. In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the holy ghost. Amen. Walk with God, Ruben. Thank you, father. Pray for me. Pray for me? I'm as human as you are. Hope the bulls are good. Aah. Aah. Well, child? I've never seen birds so beautiful. I color them myself, it's a small hobby. Well, tell us about you and Pepe Gonzales, huh? Oh, father, I love him so much. My heart aches with it. But every time he comes to see me makes the feud worse. So Pepe is playing Romeo to your Juliet, huh? Isn't he wonderful, father? That's not the term I use for him. My village would never allow me to marry Columba man. That's why I thought of the statue. What statue? Here's my dowry money, 300 pesos I saved for years. Do you think it's enough to buy a statue of Don Romulo? Don Romulo? Milpa Verde has his bones, do they want a statue also? Oh, not for Milpa Verde for Columba. I thought if someone from Milpa Verde gave Columba such a beautiful present, it might settle the feud. For this you would give up all your savings? To marry Pepe, I'd crawl on my knees to the Shrine of Guadalupe. You know the statue might be the solution. [sighs] Unfortunately, there's no sculptor around capable of such a piece of art. Ruben is going to Mexico City. If I can get him before the bus leaves he'll bring us a beautiful Don Romulo. Take my horse! [instrumental music] Yes, I understand what you want. Come back Monday and I'll have it ready for you. Oh, thank you. You are very kind. Until I see you again. Uncle.. ...there you go again, letting yourself trying to make promises you can't keep. I can keep this one. Remember the bust of Julius Caesar that the university didn't fully appreciate? Julius Caesar? But he wants someone called Don Romulo Baldera. Precisely, after I change the name who'll know the difference? [speaking in foreign language] Yes, she's staying here again. Would the great matador like to know his destiny? Keep your evil eye to yourself, old woman. [blowing raspberry] Take this as a present to the senorita. And if she should need help, my address is inside. Thank you. [indistinct chatter] (male #4) 'Look, you...where do you think you're going?' The sister of Gitanillo ordered some candy. (male #4) 'One moment.' Get me Senorita dela Torrano. She can afford any kind she wants. Why should she buy from a street vendor? Mine's the best. Senorita dela Torrano? This is the assistant manager speaking. There is a man in the lobby who says you wish to buy some sweets from him. Oh, of course, senorita. I shall send him up immediately. Have one of your boys conduct this person to room 603. Psst, and delay him as long as possible. Find Gitanillo. [telephone ringing] [speaking in foreign language] Gitanillo? Well, of course he's here. [singing in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [guitar music] [speaking in foreign language] [music continues] [music continues] [indistinct chatter] [music continues] [cheering] [instrumental music] Come in. Isn't he the right one, senorita? Oh, yes, of course. The gypsy woman who sells lace downstairs sent you this book. She said if you ever have need for her, her address is inside. Don't have anything to do with that old hag, senorita. They say she deals in black magic. Oh, I'm sure she's harmless. Wait, I'll get my purse. There's the right punch. How I'd love to kiss those lips. But I don't want a knife in my back. He's a little something extra for your trouble. Thank you, senorita. I wanted some candy, Gitanillo. You won't allow me to go out so I had the bell boy bring him here. Get out. [instrumental music] I bought you that ring that you admired. But I see you prefer candy. [music continues] I can't stay long, Gitanillo may come back. Oh, Ruben, hold me close. This moment must last me till I die. He can't keep you locked up like a nun in a convent. I'm going to marry you. No, Ruben, there's a reason why you can't. He believes his life is bound to mine. That if I ever marry, he will die. - But.. - Don't laugh. We are gypsies, we believe these things. Remember he faces the black bull of death every Sunday. He doesn't mean to be cruel. In his own way, he's good to me. Gives me everything I want. Everything, except the right to love. I'm going to take you home with me. He'd kill you. I'm not afraid. Tomorrow after the bullfight, I'm going to tell him about us. You've been with that candy vendor. How far has this gone? - I love him. - How far has this gone? Don't be afraid, my brave brother. You are still safe. I go into the bull ring tomorrow. And you risk my life with an alley dog sniffing at your skirts. Then stay out of the bull ring, matador. If you see that candy vendor again, I will kill him. Then kill me too, either way I die. All my life I have sacrificed for you. Now it's my turn to be happy! I'm going to marry this man! Marry him? - Ah! - First he must be alive. When I finish this image you must dress it with something your enemy has worn. 'Fasten a lot of his hair on its head.' Then pierce its heart with a long pin. Then, leave it in a place where he will find it. The magic works faster if the victim knows someone wishes him ill. No one must know where you got this. - No one. - Remember, child. What is once with a power of darkness, is not easy to keep. - Here he is. - Finally. Do you realize you have less than an hour to change and get to the plaza? Pay him. Has he been back here? No all day. Nobody's seen him, matador. - Flowers, Gitanillo? - You, old woman! Do you know where that candy vendor lives? Not I, your sister likes my work. Special price for you. Will you hurry, matador? Flowers, flowers. - How did this get torn? - I don't know, matador. There's a piece missing. Give me the red and gold. There is no time, matador. It lacks ten minutes to four. Light the candles. [grunting] (crowd) Ole! Huh. Ha. (crowd) Ole! (crowd) Ole! (crowd) Ole! (crowd) Ole! (crowd) Ole! (crowd) Ole! Huh-ha! [applause] (crowd) Ole! (crowd) Ole! (crowd) Ole! [cheering] [crowd chattering] No, Gitanillo, no! [all clamoring] [screaming] Gitanillo, look out! [all screaming] [indistinct shouting] [band music] Tea and coconuts with provision. Tea and coconuts. - Candy, Little Doctor? - Ruben, where is Lola? Father Zacaya says we're going to get a wonderful surprise. She's staying home, Pepe. Candy, tea, coconut, Don Carlos. - Candy, professor? Senora? - No thanks. Tea, coconut, delicious molasses heart. I still can't believe that Ruben married to that gypsy wild cat. Citizens of Columba. A certain public spirit citizen of Milpa Verde has donated a statue of Don Romulo as a peace offering to regain our well merited friendship. Let's invite Milpa Verde over to celebrate. Let's see the gift first. Oh, now I can see my Eufemia. As Don Romulo's noble features are unveiled to the world may the feud with that town be ended forever. [applause] Hey, hey, that isn't Don Romulo! That is Julius Caesar! Julius Caesar? What an insult! [indistinct shouting] - 'Down with Milpa Verde!' - 'Down with Milpa Verde!' [instrumental music] If Napoleon Lopez asks you to walk three times around the plaza, accept his offer of marriage 'and no arguments!' [band music] [indistinct chatter] [music continues] Not even a smile for the drummer? Oh, my darling, not again. Don't you know even the dogs will recognize you? They haven't yet. What? - Where? - There! Of all times, why did you choose today to come here? I had to walk beside you. Pepe, you know I want to be engaged to you but sometimes, a man can be too brave. Oh, don't worry, my dove I have a new way to end the feud. Look, Don Homero, that stupid Columba has threatened us to a cock fight! "The stakes to be the bones of Don Romulo against the famous Gonzalez cheeses! The miserable worms, they never would've dared to challenge us if only I had my beautiful black Satan! [crowd cheering] Hey, your honor. Your daughter looks beautiful enough to marry. Thank you, Don Lacero. But you're out there beating the drum! No! I'm here drinking tequila! Then who is that drummer? The stranger who gave me tequila! Spread the news, cut off every street. He won't escape us this time! Follow me! [all clamoring] [band music] [speaking in foreign language] Hey! [indistinct chatter] - Oh! - Oh, forgive me. Forgive me, future father-in-law. "Father-in-law?" [screaming] Ay! [all clamoring] [dramatic music] [music continues] Split up! I'll go that way. [music continues] [bell tolls] [music continues] [music continues] [howling] Aah! Take everything up to my room. Oh, be careful of that little bag. - Surprise, surprise. - Oh, here they are. Now, the house is happy again, my children. I think I've missed you more this time than ever before. I'm glad to be home, my father. You look tired, Alejandro. Oh, dear, perhaps, I shouldn't have mentioned that. Mm, it's just another headache. With you permission, my father I'll take something for it. What a beautiful material! - It must be imported. - Hmm? Oh, yes, I've got lots of new clothes, mother. - Come on upstairs and see. - Elena. Has he had many of these headaches? - Yes, I think he needs glasses. - Hmm. I've tried to get him to an oculist in Mexico City.. Well, you know how stubborn he is. Come on upstairs, mother. [instrumental music] [music continues] (female #1) 'Elenita!' 'It's so good to see you again.' (Elena) 'Mother, wait until you see' 'all the beautiful new things I bought.' Oh, how daring! This will make a sensation on the Plaza, Sunday night. Oh, that's not for Columba, mother. That's to wear on the boat to Europe. - You're going abroad? - I intend to see Paris. And Madrid and.. ...every place I ever dreamt about. That's right, dear, go while you can because after the children come, you will be tied down. There aren't gonna be any children, mother. What? I never expected to hear such a thing from a daughter of mine. Oh, it's not my fault, it's Alejandro, he.. He never comes near me.. But I-I never heard of such a thing! Oh, it's true and.. Mother.. He must have another woman somewhere. While he's gone, I'll search his room. Sometimes, it's better not to know! Your father had his weaknesses too but I just ignored them. That made our marriage very much easier. What do you expect to find? If I could just find a handkerchief a souvenir, anything, if I could just get a little proof of it, that's all I need. Even without children, to be a wife of a Castillo has its compensations. - Don't cause a scandal. - No, no, mother. No scandal. Don Carlos wants a grandson. If I told him the truth-- - No, you wouldn't-- - I would if I had to! It's my only weapon against Alejandro. Every woman in town is waiting for me to have a baby. In a year they're gonna say I'm barren. [sobs] Oh, mother you just don't know the humiliation I've suffered! Elenita, my poor child. Mother, mother, Alejandro might come back. I don't want him to see me with my eyes all swollen. Now, please, please go, mother. - But-- - Go, go. If you stay here, I'll just keep on crying. - But you need me. - Please go, mother! [crying] [instrumental music] Alejandro. You shouldn't have come here. I know. I made a terrible mistake, Maria. With all our fine planning.. ...we forgot one thing. We forgot how much I love you. I love you too, Alejandro but you must go, you mustn't come here again. And if we should meet in the street I mustn't look at you nor you at me. I will not stay long. I came to give you this. It belonged to my mother. When I'm gone ...you'll go to my father. - To Don Carlos? - You'll give him this. And say there is something inside for his eyes alone. - But, Alejandro-- - Promise. It's the last thing I'll ask of you. I promise. [music continues] So.. ...this is my rival. Elena, please, don't make a scene now. We have loved each other since we were children. Yes. Maria of the River Road. How is it possible for the grand Alejandro Castillo to sink so low? - Be quiet! - Quiet? I'll shout this filth from the house tops. You and this...nameless.. ...little wench! Be quiet! Hold your tongue! [dramatic music] (Alejandro) Maria. Where are you, Maria? Alejandro, Alejandro, darling! Get me home, Maria. I...I mustn't die here. [music continues] Where is Father Zacaya? - Why hasn't he come? - I didn't send for him. But he must receive the last Sacraments. I won't send for Father Zacaya while you're in this house. [music continues] [music continues] Come here, young woman. So, you are Maria of the River Road. 'Perhaps you wonder why I sent for you?' I'm glad you did, Don Carlos. I hesitated to intrude upon your grief but I too must speak to you. So, let me warn you in advance. Elena has told me the whole sordid affair. I-I don't know what she's told you but Alejandro never felt ashamed because of me. And you have no need to be ashamed for him. Perhaps, most men have other women in their lives but what I cannot understand is how he could have chosen a woman of your background. Because I live alone by the river that doesn't make me bad, Don Carlos. There's no need to discuss it now. I've waited to see you until after Elena left for Europe. You've humiliated her enough. You will leave this valley. But where would I go? My home is here! If you leave quietly, I'll give you a reasonable amount. You can set yourself up in a new life where your past is unknown. A girl as attractive as you can easily find someone else. I've loved only one man in my life and that man was your son. There will never be anyone else. Don't make me leave the places where he and I have walked together. Doesn't the great love you say you had for my son make you wish to protect his memory from any scandal? I suppose it doesn't really matter now where I live. Good, that's settled. I'll get you the money. Don Carlos, I don't want your money. Now that you've finished with me I would like to finish my business with you. I promised Alejandro I would give this to you. He told me there was something in it for your eyes alone. This was his mother's. So he told me. [instrumental music] Maria! 'This concerns both of us.' "My dearest father, I've kept one secret from you. "The only woman I've ever loved is "Maria of the River Road. '"She's the one who persuaded me' '"to marry the woman you chose for me.' '"So that I might leave you a grandson.' "But I could not fulfil my marriage '"because my love for Maria was too strong.' '"Since I have so little time' "I want to make certain she is protected. "Therefore I'm leaving her the inheritance "I received from my mother. "I trust you to see that my wish is carried out. "Do not grieve for me. "Few men have had the good fortune "to possess the love of ...such a father.. "...and such a woman. I sign myself your.." [instrumental music] You understand what it means Maria? You are now the richest woman in the valley. I've always been the richest woman because your son loved me. Don Carlos, I.. I don't want this money, it would cause gossip. I don't want anything that might hurt his memory. Burn the letter. Forget that it was ever written. [music continues] You fill me with shame, Maria. Forgive me. I loved him so.. I cling to life by a mildew thread. Yet, God took him and left me. Father Zacaya says.. ...there is a reason for everything. With your permission. Maria.. ...don't go. This big house is empty without Alejandro. You're welcome here. But I couldn't. This is another woman's house. Elena is no more a daughter to me than she was wife to Alejandro. She writes, she will never come back here. I'm glad of it. Please stay. But then everyone would know the truth. It's time they knew. Live here? A nameless one? We're both lonely without Alejandro. Stay here, my daughter. Stay here. Maria de Castillo. [music continues] Lola! Bring me some wax paper. [thunder rumbling] Why are you sitting here in the dark? The storm heat will make you sick. People are coming to find me. There are no gypsies here. They're coming.. ...to find the evil woman.. ...who killed her brother. Oh, Lola, you're imagining things. They will cut off a lock of my hair.. ...they'll burn it in the fire. And the memory of me will shrivel and die. I can't bear to see you torture yourself like this. [bell ringing] [scoffs] It's only a trader. If they find us together.. ...they will kill you also. I mustn't stay here. No one will ever take you away from me. How did you know to do this thing? You think only gypsies know the ancient ways? This is my land! My people were here before Cortez. Our God still live in these mountains. Listen. Then you will hear their voices. I'm afraid. - I'm afraid! - No, Lola, no. Fear is only in your mind. I'll get the Little Doctor. [indistinct chattering] Ready. [applause] Throw it. Oh! - You shameless one! - Oh, I'm sorry. I.. I'm still not speaking to you. Pepe, one moment. Have you seen the Little Doctor? Yes, Signora Romero is finally having her baby. Oh! And I hear your woman is sitting on the nest too, huh? - No, Pepe. - Ah. Don't be shy with Pepe Gonzales. See, I naturally expect to be your sons godfather. I bought him a present. But Lola isn't going to have a baby. Of course she is! Hasn't the Little Doctor been to see her three times? Lola's sick. Very sick. Oh, I...I'm sorry Ruben. And I've had a good luck charm put on it, see? Cost me 10 pesos. Maybe you can get your money back. From a gypsy? Never! Gypsy! Are there gypsies here? Just a few. Passing through. Ruben! Wait for me! [dramatic music] Lola? 'Lola! Where are you?' She's not here. Maybe she went to the church. [organ music] [music continues] Don Inocente, where are those gypsies? I personally chased them out of town. Where did they go? Who knows where a gypsy wanders? How can I find her, Pepe? How can I find her? Maybe you should ask Tia Magdalena? She knew you were going to Mexico City. Maybe she knows where you can find Lola. Gypsies are children of the changing moon. When they link hands with Grandfather Devil they can find no peace until they break the spell. By passing through earth and water, fire and air. Tonight, when the thunder beats its drums and the lightning is a flame in the sky the sleeping Gods awaken. Perhaps you've heard their voices calling to her? Perhaps high in the mountain tops where the four winds blow she is dancing to the witch music. [thunder rumbles] [intense music] [instrumental music] [dramatic music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [intense music] [thunder rumbling] [dramatic music] Ruben.. ...my husband. I'm free. I'm free! [wind howling] [guitar music] [indistinct chattering] [singing in foreign language] "Notice to the people of Columba "Milpa Verde accepts your challenge. "We'll meet you next Sunday after mass at the boundary line. "Leave your fire arms at home. What challenge? What mischief is brewing now? I don't know, padre. Haven't seen Pepe Gonzales all day. Pepe Gonzales. [chicken clucking] Well, hold him still, Ruben I don't want to change the color of his eyes. He pecked me, I think he's hungry. (Pepe) 'Ow!' Remember, Satan, if you don't win next Sunday. I.. I'll never see my sweetheart again. Never! You're wasting lots of artistic talent. That paint isn't sticking. Why don't you ask Father Zacaya how he paints his canaries? Woman, are you crazy? Father Zacaya doesn't approve of cock fights. Do you have a recipe in that book for dying birds? This is my medical book! [groans] Whatever you're brewing smells worse than medicine. Don't criticize. My little cow is about to become a mother and this is going to bring it on. If it doesn't kill it first. I don't think this paint's any good. It was good enough for the cheese factory roof. Maybe I should dip him in it. [knocking on door] (Zacaya) Tia Magdalena? - Father Zacaya! - Father Zacaya? What do you suppose he wants? Well, he didn't come to buy a charm. One little moment, Father Zacaya. - Hide! - Yeah. Shh! - Good morning, father, come in. - Good morning. (Pepe) 'Good morning, father!' So here you are, Pepe Gonzales. Forgive me for not getting up, father. But I-I got a terrible stomach ache. [Pepe groans] You do feel feverish. Oh! Don't concern yourself, father. - Tia's making me some herb tea. - Yes, father. Seems to me you haven't been feeling well ever since you visited the Milpa Verde carnival. Speaking of Milpa Verde, I understand there's to be a contest there next Sunday without firearms. 'Just what kind of a contest is that supposed to be?' Why ask me, father? [groans] [sighs] Why am I always blamed for everything? Because you're usually guilty, my son. No use asking you two, you protect Pepe if he set fire to the church? [grunts] You better take the medicine right away. Father! I don't think it's strong enough yet. [coughs] That's strong enough to me. [chuckles nervously] Oh, no, no, father. It-it's too hot to drink. Nonsense, that's what does the good. Hold your nose. Open your mouth. But I feel much better! [gags] Now that wasn't bad, was it? I'm not going to question you until you feel better. But I know this contest was invented by your fertile brain. And I mean to find out what it is. - With your permission. - Goodbye, father. [rooster crows] (all) Shh! [door opens] A fighting cock. Mm-hm. Where did you acquire him? This time, the truth! Uh, from the mayor of Milpa Verde. I-I borrowed him. So the challenge Milpa Verde accepted is to be a cock fight. What a barbarity, and only you will have the nerve to challenge them with their own bird! We tried to color him so they would not know him but we lacked the experience. Have you no shame at all? Father, I.. I know the world calls me the wild one. I admit I'm a man of little value but.. ...for once in my life I want to do a fine thing. And isn't stopping a feud a fine thing, father? Of course it is, but I can't allow a cock fight. But there have been Holy wars, and surely war is an evil thing. Why can't there be a Holy cock fight? Don't use your golden tongue on me Pepe Gonzales. Give me that bird! But it's my only chance to marry Eufemia. We shan't discuss it any further. What are you going to do with him, father? Dye him, properly. [laughing] [band music] [indistinct chattering] - Citizens of Columba! - Citizens of Milpa Verde! Citizens of Columba! We are gathered here for the serious business of a cock fight. To determine the last resting place of Don Romulo's bones. 'It is understood that if we win' Columba sells us her cheese again. Agreed, and if you win as further evidence of our good faith we will make you a present of this magnificent sample. [crowd murmurs] - Milpa Verde, ready? - We are ready! - What if they recognize Satan? - Don't lose confidence. His own mother wouldn't recognize him. Milpa Verde, show your bird! Lucifer, brother of Satan. [cheering] Michael, conqueror or the devil! [crowing] [dramatic music] [cheering] What Easter egg hatched that bird? Your honor, red is the symbol of a mighty warrior. He'll need that color to hide his wounds. [laughing] You all know the rules. If one bird refuses the challenge he will be regarded as defeated. 'Prepare your bird.' [crowd murmuring] [spits] 'Set your birds.' [chattering continues] [clucking] [crowing] [crowd murmuring] - 'Bueno!' - 'Bueno!' What filthy Columba trick is this? This bird has been dyed. No wonder they wouldn't fight, they're brothers. This is my beautiful black Satan. You son of a mountain goat. (crowd) Ooh! - Pepe Gonzales, is this true? - Yes, I did, but I didn't-- But Satan belongs to him. - Him? - To him? You said with your own mouth you'd give Satan to the man I love. Before I'd let you marry a Columba man I'd lock you up in a convent. And I'd lock you up in jail first. Now, hear me, all of you! I've done my best to settle this feud. But whether there's ever peace between us or not I am going to marry Eufemia! Oh, no, you're not! She's going to marry me! You.. - Ah! - Oh! Ay! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! 'Stop it! Stop it!' 'Stop! Stop it! Stop!' Stop! [clamoring] Stop! Stop! Stop! Little Doctor, come here. The priest has been hurt. He's been hit by a stone. I'm not hurt by the stone. But I'm deeply hurt to see you fighting like animals. These two innocent creatures have shown you Gods will. Brotherly love! Pepe Gonzales, you and I are equally guilty. You, for stealing Don Homero's bird and I, for disguising him. Because of this Columba must forfeit the contest. Milpa Verde, the cheese is yours. [crowd cheering] [instrumental music] Why, there's a statue inside! Don Romulo himself might have posed for that. [crowd murmuring] This statue is the gift of your Eufemia Calderon 'and our Don Carlos Castillo.' Don Romulo himself would weep with shame to see this valley which he loved so dearly, torn asunder by a senseless feud over his final resting place. Only two of you discovered the eternal truth. That love is stronger than hatred. Eufemia Calderon ...Pepe Gonzales.. '...step forward.' Give me your hands. May the brave love of these two young people wipe away forever the boundary of hatred between our two villages. And may God bless this engagement. [instrumental music] [crowd cheering] [instrumental music] [music continues]
