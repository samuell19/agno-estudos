Fucked you? - You're a whore! - What? Piss off! I told you, piss off! Go on! Will you showwhat you can? Your style is crap, toy! Tino! Hey, train, train. I think I heard a noise there. - Where? You imagined it. - Crap ... - The cops! Cops! Feet! Halt immediately! Shit! Achim! All clear. Come on. - Damn! - Tino! What's wrong with Achim? - The cops got him. - What? Achim, sits at the cop's and worries. What kind of nonsense are you talking about? What kind of shit you telling? Hey, calm down, there are enough problems today already. Don't talk nonsense. - See ya. - Achim! In an hour on the lake. Gosodi gave me a body ... Enough of the red for the evening? - David wake up, enough red? - I'm not going. - What do you mean you're not going? - Tonight. And in general. Don't joke around. I'm not kidding. Do want to drop us? Drop the crew? Seen the ATL train car? Tino, it's full of crap, and suddenly the status of kings. And the piece on the wall, this is the shit We are not picturesque. Anyway, let's plan an action with the whole train, or we can then mix with the housewives of the district and their drawing club. Hey David, we're together 3 years, And what, we're going to surrender? This is your team. Where is the accountability? Responsibility ... You haven't even changed the son's diapers. Piss off. Piss off! Your father and I have come up with something for you. We have registered you at a really good school, a boarding school. What did you register? Beautiful landscape. Achim! It's in the old wing housing Proffesor Kullman. Here's the number. And tell them that I sent you, and you'll get in right away. And bring a sample of your work with you. Thank you. - Hello. - Hi, Kenny. - See you soon. - Bye. Anyway, suddenly the cops surrounded us. David, Achim, Tino and I started to run. - Happy birthday. - Thank you! - Is Tino here? - No, but he's coming soon. - Well, what happened then? - So ... - E. Cheers! Hey Achim! Hold this. Hello. Take what you want here. David's near the water. Can I live with you? Of course. So what? Well, finished? Then show it. What sort of crap is this? I gave you everything, And now you're giving me this crap? It's total shit. Shit ... Dino, I'm sorry! I didn't mean this. I worked all night. Listen, it looks cooler on a finger. Elias liked it, see. Looks cool? Listen, I'll be at home and later we'll go together to the party. - Okay? - Okay. Thanks. See ya. Hi Mom. Listen I'm busy ... No, he just left. Home? The police? I'll call him. Tino, wait! What are you sick? Dear Tino ... Daddy Who are you? I live here. Mom, what's going on here? What'd you do here? This is my room, what are you doing? Stop digging around my stuff! It is not yours, stop! Calm down, we have a warrant. - What is he doing there? - We are authorized to search every room. - But not mine though. Listen, we can search any room which your brother has access to. - Do not yell at my daughter! - Calm down, or we'll calm you down. That's an order. Now tell me why my son is a suspect? Your tickets. Shit. This is what we found at the crime scene. Do you have ID? Any other document with your name? Then go in. Yeah, OK. But you've already had two. Hey David, Call Tino, find out where he's stuck. - His cell phone seems off. - Then call home. Want another beer? Want another beer? Well, what? Maybe problem with transportation? David. - Tino ... - What happened to him? - He had an accident .. - What? What accident? He's hurt? Damn, you scared me. So Tino, is he coming now? David? David! He got it from his father. - Tino has another one of your sweaters. - It doesn't matter. - Come, come with me. Total chaos, you know him. This one's yours? David! Yes. Your drawings are somewhat thematically limited. They are a bit graphic, but the dynamics are extremely pleasing. For example, these light and dark contrasts ... with excellent hatching, right below the beautiful nuances. This is very apparent... technically, you're absolutely mature. Mr Schubert. Mr Schubert, your works!
