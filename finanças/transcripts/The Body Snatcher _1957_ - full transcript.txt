Are you finished? - Yes, master. - Let's go then. Horrible crime! The corpse of the famous athlete Jorge Asate, murdered yesterday, has disappeared! Can we go in! - It's not allowed. Orders from above. Oh, come on, man, I'm just doing my job. I completely agree with the forensics. It's neither an accident... nor a murder. Bones have been removed from the skull using some equipment unknown from me. And the manner in which the veins and arteries were sewn is truly surprising. See you later. - Doctor, please come with me. You keep that away from the press, ok? Come, doctor. You're not allowed to be here! Who wants to see me? Hey, mate! What on Earth are you doing here? - It's a long story. When did you arrive? - I've been looking for you since yesterday. I thought you'd become a sports star, but now I see you're just another sharply dressed cop! A lot of things happened since last time we met. Listen, I wanna talk to you. When can we meet up? In a moment. Don't move! - Hurry up, then. Those are the best descriptions we have. But they're inconsistent. He's a maniac, a dangerous criminal. We did those portraits as the witnesses described. That is how one witness described him. There's not a single common feature in those drawings which would indicate that's the same man. At least we know one thing for sure. In all the crimes, the MO is the same. His victims are always wrestlers. Always strong men. We took all possible precautions. Our best people are on the case. Captain Robles is in charge of the investigation. Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me, I need to do an inspection. Give me the report later, eh? The Toronto case was terrible! - This way, I'll give you the info you need on our case. Now I'm free. We could take a walk and talk a bit. Lucia, please, call for my car. Man, come on, I got my car. Okay, let's go. - Wait, I have to say goodbye. To who? Oh, you'll never change! - Goodbye, Miss. Have a good time. Now you can tell me what brings you to the capital. You know, I've been training at home and now I want to become a professional wrestler. Damn, man! - I've improved a lot. I'm sure you could help me now. Maybe you know someone from the scene or you could give me some advice. Of course, why not. We'll go to the gym right now. These Japanese guys will never learn the ropes. It's useless. Ok, we'll go with a simple presentation then. Good. Lottery tickets! Who wants them? If you win, I'll bring you the prize here. I'm not interested. You can pay me whenever you like. I'm not interested. Clear off! Want some lottery tickets? - No. The Tiger and The Wolf will fight at the end of the month. The cartel wants to set up the fight in favor of The Tiger. Are we sure they'll agree? They'll have too. The Wolf will lose the fight, understood? Just look at him. Nothing suspicious, boss. Listen Captain, what a mess with all these men here! - I'll explain to you. Right now I don't know who are the policemen and who are my guys! "The police could do nothing about the strange case of grave robberies" What does it have to do with my gym? That's precisely what the presence of my men here is about. I'll explain to you. Listen. Come here, Tiger. What is it? - Next month you'll fight The Wolf. Me? There's no other fighter? What, you're afraid? - Afraid? No, but... You don't want this chance? - Chance, yes, but... Right, so now you have one. You won't have another if you refuse. Sorry to interrupt. You work here? No, Mister. I'm fooling around. Oh, I see. I'm not gonna take anymore of your time. You know, I'm from far away. Don't tell me, I'm not interested. Really? I just arrived in town. You're sure you're not interested? I don't know anyone around here. What did you say your name was? I didn't say. Oh, I see. But if you want to say it now, I'm all ears. Could you let me do my work, please? Okay, good. I have to lose? - That's what this is about. So the cartel has decided the Tiger shall win? - Exactly. Order comes from the cartel. I don't want to lose! I don't want to! - Shut up! Don't "shut up" me! You're stressed out. We'll talk later. It's not too late to make a fortune! Today might be your lucky day! Buy one of my tickets! It's easy to mistreat a poor old man, eh? Don't stick your nose where it doesn't belong. Could you give me a punch like that? Even with a broken arm. Only an imbecile would brag like that. You need some help? There's no more gasoline. - May I? Try it now. My name is Guillermo. Okay, I'm Lucia. Thank you for the lighter. Lucia, what a lovely name. Fits you like a glove. As I said, I don't know anyone here and I'm lonely. Do you smoke? - No, I can't with the training. I came to Mexico to become a famous wrestler. They're fighting for real! They're cutting themselves to pieces! I never thought my boys could be in danger. What's going on there? Go separate them! They're killing each other! Let me go! I tell you, let me go! What's wrong with him? - It seems he doesn't agree with our rules. Who is he? - He's odd, a good fighter, he came here not long ago. From where? - He says he's Cuban, but I don't believe him. He's a good fighter, though. The worst thing is, we have to put up with him. Put up with him? Why? If a fighter is good we have to keep him at all costs. By the way, there's a friend of mine I'd like you to meet. Guillermo, please. This is Guillermo Santana. An old friend. - Pleased to meet you, sir. He's trying to fight. Professionally? - Yes, sir. He's got a good body, eh! - I recommend him personally. We'll see what we can do. Rubio! Give him a pass to come and train here whenever he wants. Thank you very much. - Come with me, please. Wait a second, please, I have to say goodbye. So this Cuban guy, what did you say his name was? Things are getting in order. - You're happy? Of course. But I don't want to eat dinner alone. Is this an invitation? Forgive me but I'm not used to dining with a man I don't know. Please. - No way. Please! - No! That bull I told you about is not mine, it belongs to a friend. But I have eleven cute little piggies. They all look the same. Cute and chubby. You can't say they aren't brothers. When one has a family like that one's sure got a reason to live. Just look at those shiny little eyes. Their father has been rewarded with the first prize in a local contest. I'll show them to you one day, I promise. You'll sit on the ranch's porch. The sun will shine on you. The sky will slowly become red. The cows will slowly march towards the barn. The birds will sing their songs. The sunlight will slowly fade until everything is quiet. And you'll hear the grasshoppers chirping, while the round white moon shine his rays on all the place around. What do you want? - The bill, Senor. - Oh, yes. What's wrong? Damn! I lost my wallet. That's why you insisted on inviting me out. Ok, I'll pay. If you come with me, I'll repay you. To your house? To get the money? No. Don't think bad of me. In my village, we're not like that. Come. See you tomorrow. - See you. What's up? - It's pointless, nothing's going on here. You always come in at seven, what happened? The other one got sick and because I'm not familiar with the route, I'm running late. You know where the laundry is? - No. In the fourth room, there are 30 towels and 30 sheets. Thank you. It's eight o'clock. Time to make our round. - Okay See you tomorrow morning. Nobody bought my tickets today. Dad, here's your dinner. Mom asks if you could lend me eight pesos. Oh, your mom is always asking for money! You got change? - Yes. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten. Take it. - Mom asks you to come early. I'll come when I'm finished. You're so lucky they bring you food from the house. It's cheaper. Take a bit if you want. - How could I... - Come on! - I'm sure it's delicious. Oh, this tacos is so tasty! Excuse me, I made such a mess! - Don't worry about it. Hey, you! Are you sure you're taking the clothes and nothing more? - Of course. 30 towels, 30 sheets. You counted them? Yes, sir, they're all there. You can check, if you want. - No, it's okay. I believe you. What's happening? - Nothing, he's taking the dirty clothes. It's okay. I'm sorry for the mess. - It's nothing. Throw it in the bin. - Thanks. Oh here you are, captain, I'm sorry, I forgot to ask you... Keep calm, sir. Another day. Who were these two guys in that car? - They came for the dirty clothes. Come on captain, give me... Not now, another day. Let's go, guys. How's the patient? - The transfusion's just finished. His pulse? - It's coming back. Good. We can begin with the trepanation. He's waking up! Another failure. The nerves were working. Even the muscles began to work. Blood rushed through his veins. He had the desire to live. Only one thing failed. This man was weak, master. Very weak. Yes, I know. But I'm not weak. The power of my brain must balance the weakness of their bodies. I have to create the strongest man, stronger than extinct species. I know what went wrong. Yes! The grafted brain wasn't strong enough. I'll try again and again until I triumph over death. Hey cutie, can you light me up? You won't light my cigarette, cutie? Hey, you! Captain Robles wants to talk with you. With me? - Yes, let's go. Do you recognize him? - Yes, of course. - Here he is, chief. I heard something happened here. - The Black Wolf was killed. Killed? He owed me 50 pesos! Who will pay me back now? Would you recognize the laundry man who came here last night? Did you get a good look at him? - My eyes aren't good, but I saw him. I want to know if you could identify him. I think I could try. Take him to the station. - Yes, captain. Found anything? - No. - Let's check the sewers. How easily a man can get killed, eh? I was sunbathing. We have a date at 1:00, yes? What's the time? - Five to 1:00. But there's no hurry at all, I assure you. Of course. I don't know why I wasted so much time. Let me get dressed. - Why, let's talk like this. I'll go put something on. Wait a moment. Please, pick up the phone. Hello? Yes, 14-21-22. Yes, it's Guillermo Santana talking. Yes, she's fine. Who is it? - It's for me. It's Carlos calling me. - Okay. How did you guess I was here? You forget I'm a policeman. Listen, I need you immediately. Yes, right now. It's an important case. If it's that important, I'll come right away. Would you do me a favor? What did Carlos say? - He needs me right now for his investigation. Let's go together? - Well, in the best case scenario, I'll be left behind and have to wait for you. - No, let's go. It won't be long. - Go, I'll wait. You promise? - Of course. I'll be back. Don't vanish into thin air! What's going on? - I thought that this man.. What? - He reminds me a lot of someone who owes me a lot of money. But is he the guy who took the clothes, yes or no? Well, many men look the same. For example my friend Timoteo who... Enough of that. Take him away. Release them. Come with me. - Quick! Here's the evening newspaper. The famous fighter, Black Wolf, was murdered in the presence of the captain, two officers and nine policemen. So, what do you have to say now? I'll do everything that's possible. - That's not enough! We need more, we need results! Would you reconsider my proposition? - What proposition? Oh, that one. No, we can't risk anyone's life. I'll accept all the responsibility. - I can't authorize that. How do you know he'll agree? - I know my friend very well. I'm sure I can convince him. - Without lying? Would he understand the risks? - I'll explain to him in details. We're talking about creating a man of great strength and bravery. Damn! - A man who would give us a chance to catch the criminal. A chance to catch the criminal after he's cut my throat? That is possible. We don't want to put you under pressure. You'll be risking your life. Interesting. Wouldn't that affect my career? In Mexico nobody knows you anyway. You could wear a mask. El Vampiro! World champion from I don't know where! We will manage to turn you into a lucha libre superstar. You'll earn much money. - Yes, for a special funeral with flowers and music. What else? I must remind you that you're not obliged to accept this offer. Yes, you already told me. - Your life could be in danger. If you accept Robles' proposition, you have to understand that we're dealing with a dangerous criminal here. All this has to remain absolutely secret. Nobody must know about our plan. - Nobody? Nobody. - Damn. That's a problem. Absolutely nobody? You're thinking about Lucia? - Bull's eye. For this, I have a special solution. Come with me, I'll explain to you. See you, chief. And how long will this tour last? - Two or three months. The tour will start in the USA. I'm going to fight in San Francisco. Then in some places of minor importance. Everything is settled. Don't you think it's great that Carlos managed to set this up? Yes. - Now you see? I couldn't accomplish anything in Mexico. I'll be back with a name and a reputation. Yes. If you're back... Of course I'll be back. I don't want you to go. I have the feeling that something bad will happen. I will be back. I will be back for you. For me? I fell in love with you so quickly. - I love you too, Lucia. I love you, like I never loved before. And I will be back for you. I'll write to you every week. Every day, every... After 11 consecutive victories "El Vampiro" debuts in Mexico with a spectacular bout of three KO's in unlimited time. The wonderful "Vampiro" challenges the Judo master! He's the strongest fighter in Mexico to date! Now I believe it! I hope I made myself very clear! - But in our plan... Yes, I already know your plan. You explained it a hundred times. But our superiors aren't satisfied with your plan. They want results, real results. If we can't give them results, you and I will have to resign. And I am not willing to resign! But sir... - End of discussion. Results or resignation. Use the police force, change your agents, use your talent! We'll take different ways. Let's meet at the dead end at the top of the street. Everything is clear for you? - Yes, maestro. Synchronise your watches with mine. And remember. Every mistake could be fatal to us. Give me a lemonade. - Yes, sir. You want something else? Could you give me a light, please? Fire! Fire! Help! Come in. There's a phone call for you, Doctor. - For me? Where? - In the corridor. Who's calling? - Don't know, someone from the Red Cross. For me? From the Red Cross? I'll take it. Hey, Doc, don't you need a... How do you feel? - Really good. Don Felipe! The crowd threatens to riot! Go on, hurry up. Give yourself up! Go get the doctor! What happened? Check him, doctor. He's dead. - Captain, Captain! He's the man who came for the laundry in the gym. Are you sure? - Yes, Captain. It seems that our problems are now solved. He was the grave robber? What happened to you? - Just a scratch. Doctor! Take a look. - Nothing serious. Just a scratch. Can he fight? - Obviously. I'll rinse that with alcohol. If this is over, can I go back to Lucia? For now, only think about the fight. Ow, that hurts! - Stay calm. But it hurts! - Stay calm! Vampiro, let's go. The public grows impatient. What happened here? - An accident. The night is not over yet. This fight is not rigged. Let's go, man. Don't let anyone touch the body. I'll call forensics. - Yes, chief. Go on, the fight is starting. Miss, put me through with the police station please. Chief, it's Robles. Yes, we caught the grave robber. Two of the best national fighters will compete tonight for the world championship. In this corner, the invincible Vampiro! In that corner, the Tiger! I got good news for you. This night you'll see someone dear to you. Guillermo! Where is he? Who do you think is the invincible Vampiro? I don't know... No! Doctor, doctor! This man is dead. - Guillermo! Is he really dead? "The corpse of Vampiro robbed right under the noses of the police." What now? - We have to resign. Resign? If only my resignation could bring Guillermo back to life. I feel guilty, like I'm his murderer. I sacrificed the life of my best friend. And the criminal had made a fool of us. Of me, most of all. That's all we got on the robber. His name was Cosme Ramirez. He had no family. He left the country when he was seven through the frontier at Laredo. Not much more. - Any information on his education? Let me see. Preparatory course in medicine, two years. Nothing else. Chief, I can't hold the press any longer. They want to see you. It's okay. I'll take care of them.. Everything is working perfectly, master. Come here. He's alive! Back from the dead! I've triumphed over death! Nobody can beat me! - Calm down, master. The world will be mine! Nobody will overcome this! I will rule over humanity! I have become God! Stand up! Come to me. Walk on. Sit down. On that stool. Obey me! He's completely domesticated. Do you value your freedom so much? It's within your reach. See this cell? Go for it. Lift it up! Throw it away! Against the wall! Go inside. Lay down. You need to rest. The attendance is very low. Since Vampiro died, nobody comes anymore. That's what I want to talk about. Come, I have a surprise. Vampiro 2. Back from the dead. You can trust him. He's a good fighter with the same qualities as his predecessor. Good idea! Very good idea! In this corner, back from the dead... Vampiro 2! Why is he acting so strangely? - Don't worry. It's just an act to confuse his opponent. Attack! Attack! Go! Go! Attack! Attack! Finish him! Finish him! Unbelievable! - What a monster! Where is he? - Up the stairs! Obey! Obey me! Obey me! Don't forget you are my masterpiece! Don't forget you're mine. Obey me! Obey me! Lieutenant! A report says he killed a man in a factory in the north sector of Mexico. Let's go, now! What happened here? - The monster, he's on the loose! We're going. Wait. He left the arena and passed through here. If it's Guillermo, I know where he's going. Call the chief. Freeze! - No, don't shoot! Guillermo, it's you? The death of Guillermo Santana was surely an insufferable loss for us all, but especially for you. We sympathize with you. But there is nothing we can do to ease your pain. In the name of my superiors, please accept this as the proof of our deepest gratitude to Mr Santana. We also want to present you with this medal, which will remind you of his great bravery. Mr Santana's sacrifice wasn't for nothing. With his death he saved many lives from the hands of a dangerous criminal. Moreover, with his actions and this despite him, he proved how dangerously far one man can go to overcome obstacles and try to expand the boundaries of science in his attempt to reach a place where only God reigns. Please accept my condolences and those of my superiors. And rest assured that we are eternally grateful to your beloved. timings + translation: stodwa proofreading: aloysius70
