IN THE NAME OF GOD Speak to me... I haven't told anyone yet. How long can I endure this? A day? A week? A month? Should I worry about myself or them? Daddy! If they ﬁnd out... Daddy Yusef! Could they deal with it? I found them! Good. Throw them in. I'm ready I'm the small one and you're the big one One, two, three... Go! - I'll Win! - No, I'll win! - Hurry! - Yeah! Go! - I won! - What about me? You got stuck in the middle of the stream And if you cheated? I swear to God! - Are you angry? - Of course not. It's only a game Why are you crying then? I'm not crying, my eyes burn a bit. Let's go Are we going to the mountains tomorrow, Daddy? I don't know. Maybe But you promised we'd go on Friday with Mommy Roya Well, yes, but I might have to work tomorrow Daddy, don't work tomorrow, please OK, we'll go Rumi with his tact and sharp mind... gave all he had to Shams-e Tabrizi and told him to burn it Was Shams getting something in return? As for Rumi, he always bet on love and expected nothing in return Yusef, please wash Maryam's hands That's what I'm doing. Where are my eye drops? Here, on the table Come, I'll help you Tea's ready I also did Your Excellency's homework And they say angels are only in Heaven! Don't be silly! - When will you get the test results? - It's not important - I want to talk to your doctor - Excuse me, I can't see but I can talk - I want to be sure - Of what? Let me see who... Roya! Don't worry, I'll pick them up - Thank you, Professor. -You're welcome When did you get here? Are you still worried? I have something to tell You Have You forgotten all about me? I'm Yusef The one You deprived of the beauties of the world and who never complained Instead of light and brightness, I lived in darkness and gloom I didn't protest I found happiness and peace in this small paradise Are all these years of hardship not enough... that You now want to cause me even more suffering? Will I come back from this trip to my loving family? Will this illness bring me to my knees? To whom should I complain about what You're doing to me? I beg of You to show me more compassion Don't take my life away "This is the Book of Masnavi—e Ma'navi" This is a prayer, my son - Pray for me, mother - May God hear our prayers Roya Don't worry It's time to say goodbye I've taken care of everything Mr Kashani will be waiting for you in Paris. I've told him everything May God protect you - Thanks for everything, uncle - Well, let's go, it's getting late - Hello, I'm Kashani. I'm glad to meet you. - I'm very glad too Let's go - You're very kind. - Don't mention it I'm glad to finally meet you. I hope your flight wasn't too tiring No, I'm fine I hate flying. It's so boring I've scheduled your medical appointments You'll be staying in a guesthouse near the hospital It's very cozy. I'm sure you'll like it Many Iranians stay there when they come for medical treatment You've gone to so much trouble. How can I ever thank you? It's no trouble. Your uncle Mahmoud is like a brother to me When I was studying here many years ago Mahmoud helped me. I'm indebted to him It's best to close the windows at night, it can get very cold I'm upstairs. If you need anything dial 9. Is that OK? Yes, don't worry - Good night - Good night Mr Kashani, are you aware of Mr Musavi's condition? More or less His condition is extremely serious The tests taken in Tehran show a cancerous growth under his right eye probably malignant Is it life threatening? Yes, indeed. If the tumor grows we might need to remove his eye But we can't make a decision before he undergoes a biopsy Prior to that, we will need some more tests Should I tell you what to bring back for me? A beautiful doll Daddy, we're waiting for your return This poem is for you: Colorful butterﬂy, you're back... you sit on the window and admire our pretty garden... Hello, friend! Excuse me, who are you? My name is Morteza What are you doing here? What's wrong? It suddenly jammed Here, have some walnuts. Let me take a look Thank you I saw you when you came in. I'm getting treatment here This is my 3rd time - Careful, don't break it. Trust me! Nothing to worry about Have some walnuts, they'll give you strength. Here, have some more Thanks A screw is loose. I'll fix it You think the tape will be alright? Don't worry We've got plenty of time here Do you use tapes for teaching at the university? I do. But how do you know I teach at a university? Listen, do you hear the birds? They're heading toward the forest Behind this guesthouse, there's a forest full of birds I go there everyday. If you like we can go there today I'll fix your tape later Come on, let's go You haven't told me what brought you here A stupid little shrapnel, souvenir from the war, is still in my head It's affecting my sight Look at all these trees and not a single walnut tree! - What about willow trees? - Willow trees don't have nuts! No, but they bring back memories and also bring me luck How's that? When I was at the School for the Blind, they gave me a small willow to take care of We grew up together Now, it's now much taller than me There's a big pond over there. Maybe there are some willow Let's go and take a photo I have excellent news for you The biopsy shows that the tumor is benign and presents no danger That's unbelievable! There's more. You know that Mr Musavi became blind at the age of 8? Yes Firework sparks burned both corneas and badly damaged the retinas That's how he went blind Yes, but we've noticed both retinas are slightly sensitive to light This gives us hope Hope for what? For Mr Musavi to partially regain his sight Is that possible? Believe me, I'm as surprised as you I have to tell his family at once It's better not to give them too much hope We need more tests before we can attempt a cornea transplant. Nothing is certain I know I was wrong My biggest mistake was not knowing You well enough Now I know You didn't cross me off Your book of compassion You didn't forget about me You're with me and protecting me If only Your goodness could be complete Now that You've taken my hand, I beg You to lead me all the way More than anyone else I long for the light If I come out of this darkness, I'd be with You forever Who's there? Is that you, Mr Morteza? You devil, I bet you can see me! That good scent could only be yours I heard the good news and I'm so happy Now I understand how this willow tree brings you luck - Who told you? - Come, sit down - let me just pick up the walnuts What about you? Did you have your operation? No, this damned shrapnel is hopeless If they operate on me I may go totally blind I don't want that. I'd rather go blind slowly, no? - When is your operation? - In a few days - Are you excited? - I don't know. I'm excited and scared Scared of not seeing? Maybe scared of seeing. I've lived in another world for 38 years I don't know what might happen Eat this, it's got phosphorus. It's good for your eyes Thanks Oh, I nearly forgot I fixed your tape. Here it is Thank you so much And these are the leftovers I'm all done here. I must leave now Where to? Give me another chance, Mister Hunter. I am a fawn born in this mountain Your bullet pierced my right side, but I am wounded on the left side You wounded my heart, you wounded my heart I am just a fawn, just a fawn... - How is he? - He's OK. He needs to rest now This is my 57th night away from Iran But it feels like years since I saw my family Tomorrow they'll take off my bandages Will I see? Will I not see? Will I be able to see or not? But I... Mother... Welcome Professor! I get dizzy just thinking about all you'll have to see I can't believe it! I must be dreaming! Unbelievable but true! Puran gave me the news when I was stuck in traffic I was so happy I opened the window and yelled: "Hey, people, Yusef can see, my Yusef's eyes can see!" They must have thought I was crazy! He gave out sweets to all our neighbors Uncle Mahmoud only forgot to announce it in the newspapers Do you remember we used to go to "Twin Waterfalls"? It's the first thing I want to show you Look at me, Maryam. I want to take your picture, sweetheart! Now, get ready Mr Yusef. Good!

There's a concert by the Mowlana group.

It's a strange feeling Roya, I'll be so thrilled if one day I could discuss my thesis... and many other things with him... The symbolic language of the mystics existed long before Hafez... ...a subtle interaction between sensibility and vision... ...Poetry draws on inner feelings to create visual images... ...the encounter with Shams brought out the inner soul of Rumi... and the exaltation in his works... "My eyes opened to see the beloved and! thank God for that. " "I am a fool. Without Your kindness, I can do nothing. " Daddy! The flowers are blooming. Come and see! I was worried sick!
