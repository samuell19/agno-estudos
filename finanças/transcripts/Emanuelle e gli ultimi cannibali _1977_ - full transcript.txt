This film is based on a true story as reported by journalist Jennifer O'Sullivan Room 22, quick! Get the straitjacket! Yes! Easy! We're not gonna hurt you! Hold still! Stop moving! Get out of the way! The girl they brought two days ago. She seemed so quiet. Easy! Easy! She bit off her breast and ate it. Her file said she was found near the Amazon rainforest. We need to keep her calm now. We'll give her shock treatment tomorrow morning. Make way, nothing to see here. Go back to your rooms. What are you doing, Emanuelle? Have you gone mad? Do you want to blow your cover? Just think of the scandal you would cause... if they find out you're a journalist. Thankfully you'll be out of here tomorrow... and we won't have any trouble. But tell your boss he'll have to pay more next time. It's become too risky. You remember that. Don't worry. I don't want to hurt you. What's your name? Why don't you speak? Say something. You don't understand me, do you? And she ate the breast? A case of cannibalism. It's quite unbelievable. It could be the scoop of the century. What about the nurse? Mutilated, but she'll live. It seems she asked for it, though. Her lesbian tendencies were well known. She was the one who harassed that poor girl. Those two weeks in there have been terrible. No one can imagine what happens inside a mental asylum. Speaking of asylums, our accomplice said next time you'll have to pay more. But don't count on me if there's a next time. Come on, we got lucky. We started with a story on mental health and now we got this. Look at the weird symbol above her pubis. Yeah. It's a tattoo. It looks like some sort of Aztec symbol. Let's show it to Nelson, I'm sure he can help us. The symbol looks the same, if we compare it to these pictures from our archives. It belongs to the Tupinamba, an ancient tribe that practiced cannibalism. They're completely extinct. I'll get back to work now. Give me a shout when you need to know how many hairs Caesar had on his butt! You heard him? Just think of the headline, Emanuelle. "Young white girl raised by Amazonian tribe". Cannibal tribe would be better. The girl ate the nurse's breast. Yup. The last cannibals. What a story it'd be! I've got an idea. Have you ever heard of Professor Mark Lester? He's one of the world's foremost anthropologists, and, most of all... he led a few scientific missions in the Amazon rainforest. That's enough ideas. I need a month off after my story on the asylum. Before you go, remember that Lester is the director of the Natural History Museum. You can find him there. Professor Lester? Yes. How can I help you? I had no idea such a young man could run a museum. Well, I had a few mentions. My name's Emanuelle. I'm a journalist for the Evening Post. Let's have breakfast together, if you're looking for an interview. Not to mention it isn't easy talking with all these dinosaurs observing us. - Give me a second to give these notes to my assistant. - Of course. Give these to Ms. Brown and tell her I'll call tonight. Very well, Professor Lester. Let's go. Your job must be really hard. I do have some fine colleagues, they'd be better off without me... but I need to justify my salary, as long as they pay me. You're always joking. My interview is about cannibalism. We're doing an article on the matter and we'd like to know more. We know you're an authority in this field and that you carried out... at least ten missions among the most ferocious of those cannibal tribes. It's true about those expeditions. But it's such a broad subject that... I don't think I could tell you everything here. I might have to invite you to my place. You reckon this invitation might carry any risks? I can't say, but I wouldn't trust it if I were you. Well, I think it'd be worth it for my article's sake. Risks aside, if you visit me I'll show you my vast documentation on the subject... and you'll be free to use everything you need for the article. Thank you. I also have a number of quite interesting films. You do? I know it sounds like I'm hitting on you, but I really have all that. And I do believe you, professor. Now it's my turn to ask you something. What would you say to leading an expedition entirely financed by my newspaper? What about it? Would you accept it? Maybe you'd think being a museum director might be more cushy and lucrative. Or perhaps you'd think you've become too old for this sort of adventure. Well? You're provoking me, miss. I'll answer as soon as I've shown you something very interesting. This is Tanzania. The footage was recorded, not long ago, by famous anthropologist William Simmons. It shows two adulterers from the Kaimba tribe. This is a classic example of ritual cannibalism, see. The husband's relatives are only eating the woman's eyes. The wife's relatives feast on the man's severed penis. It looks horrible. But I'm more interested in the Amazon than Africa. Look at this picture. This girl was found in Tapurucuara, just outside the forest. The tattoo above her pubis looks like the symbol of the Tupinamba tribe. It's strange. They're extinct. Their descendants are the Yapiaka tribe. Nobody has talked about them in years. It's quite interesting. I reckon I'll accept your offer. I'll wait for you to pick me up after I take care of something that can't wait. What is it, a man? You don't think I've spent my life waiting for you. I'm a free woman and I behave as such. You're amazing, Emanuelle. But I should never fall in love with you. All done, Lester's coming. Have everything ready for tomorrow morning and book the first flight to Manaus. No. Listen, Emanuelle, I've changed my mind, it could be too dangerous. Forget about it and book the first flight to Manaus. Tomorrow morning. We're going to make it. Bye, see you soon. Alright, you win. Good luck. And good luck avoiding the cannibals, too. Phil, set everything up for an expedition to the Amazon rainforest. I was worried about you, sweetheart. That story on the asylum was great. I bet it wasn't easy. Let's spend a month in California, just you and me. I'm sorry, Peter. We can't. Tomorrow morning I'm flying to the Amazon rainforest. A story. But way more relaxing than my last one. It's about the last cannibals. Are you nuts? Yeah, you totally are. I guess. But I also want to make love so much. What, now? Now. Goodbye, Peter. Good luck. Bye. I need a minute to send a telegram to my friend Wilkins. Wait here, it won't take long. That's where they put that poor girl. I wonder if she's really crazy or that's her way to react... being taken away from what had become her home. The two tickets booked by the Evening Post, please. Thank you. What are the origins of cannibalism? No exact causes. There's often a social origin behind it. There's political cannibalism, like with Idi Amin. There's even cannibalism accepted by the civilized world... like with that plane that crashed in the Andes. This place lives by its own rules. The average life expectancy is about 35-40 years. The lack of food drove many to cannibalism. See those indios down there? If they want to build a hut, they have to fight against the forest. Is that so? Yes. And why? This climate allows the vegetation to grow incredibly fast. It'd swallow them. Almost there! I can't see anything! We'll soon go under the clouds and we'll be able to see Wilkins' landing strip. I'm the one that handed the girl to the Red Cross. Where did you find her? It was Father Morales that found her. A missionary. He lives in the forest about a hundred miles from here. She was in a state of shock, wounded, and constantly delirious. As Mark knows, I know many local dialects, and I uselessly tried to talk to her. Now let's talk about cannibalism. In my 25 years here, I've only heard of two cases, both put to rest by the authorities. The girl has a tattoo on her pubis and it looks like a Yapiaka symbol. It might be a clue, but that tribe went extinct half a century ago. - That's what I thought, but... - Mark Lester! Isabelle, you've grown into a beautiful woman! You were so little the last time I met you! It's been six years since your last visit. This is Sister Angela. This is Emanuelle, a famous photojournalist. She came here to write a story about the Yapiaka. Why don't you tell her that they went extinct at least 50 years ago? Father Morales might be able to help you. He knows all the indios in the forest. You can come with me tomorrow morning. - I'm going to deliver some supplies to his mission. - With you? Indeed. She's taken my place. She's become far more capable than this old wreck. Oh, stop saying that. If you follow the river, it will take five to six days to reach the mission. Everything goes smoothly most of the time. Sister Angela will come with you. Isabelle has done this trip at least ten times. She's such a smart girl. Manolo and Felipe, two natives, will also accompany you. Make arrangements with Isabelle for the return trip. She'll come and get you whenever you prefer. Remember you promised to spend a few days here when you return. It will be a pleasure. You're real kind. Thank you. Father Morales will be happy to see you. He hates to come here among the savages, as he calls us. You'll find out what an extraordinary man he is. Have a good trip, Mark. Thanks, Wilkins. Everything fine, sister? Yes, thank you. Everything's fine. Put this stuff in front, Manolo. You can sit here, sister. Goodbye, dad. - Goodbye, sweetie. Be careful. - Don't worry. Here's the last one. Give me. You forgot your hat and rifle, Isabelle. Thanks, dad. Bye! Bye! - Bye, Wilkins! - Bye, dad! We're leaving Bahia. We're almost out. I'm Venezuelan. I went back there for my sister's wedding... and now I can't wait to get back to the mission. So much to do there. We're five. Four nuns, plus Father Morales. Many natives bring us their children so we can treat them. The locals are still very superstitious. They still have witch doctors treating the sick with herbs and strange rituals. On the other hand, most of the time the herbs they use are quite effective. That's why we successfully started using them ourselves, down at the mission. I know. I've studied the customs of the locals for years. There's a beautiful waterfall nearby, let's stop and freshen up a little. - Felipe, we're stopping here. - Alright. I saw you with Mark. When? Last night, when you were making love. Look at that monkey! It always visits me when I'm here! Come here. Look at those crocodiles, Emanuelle! Let's stop here and set up camp for the night. Tie it down somewhere. Thanks, Isabelle. Let's grab the essential things. You're right. Let's take the tent and the food. I'm sure we'll find some fresh fruit. There's so much around here. I'll make you a nice dinner if Manolo and Felipe manage to catch a pirarucu. - Excellent! - A pirarucu? Yeah, it's a big fish! There's so many in the river and they're delicious! I keep changing film. - You'll write a great story. - Well, I hope so. The people at the newspaper will be so satisfied. I'm sure they'll give you a raise. Quick, the rifle! Don't shoot, it's too dangerous! Are you okay? Did it hurt you? Thanks, just in the nick of time. Yeah, indeed. My name is Donald McKenzie. My camp isn't far from here. - Good. - You can come with me. Thanks! Let's go. We're headed to Father Morales' mission. The mission is no more. They've been attacked and killed by a tribe. We got there just after it happened. They also destroyed the radio. I tried to fix it, but it was useless. What do you mean? The children, the nuns, Father Morales? All the natives loved him. Did they kill him as well? I don't know. There was a big number of them, from what I gathered. We'd have been killed as well if we'd arrived earlier. It was a massacre. Be strong. What a tragedy. I heard a shot, what happened? Nothing. Just a snake. This is my wife Maggie. - Hello. Come with me. Salvador, help them with their tent and prepare some food. We were headed to Father Morales' mission. I understand. Good. There might be some survivors. They're probably hiding in the forest. We'll arrange for a helicopter search. Please, don't cry. I'll never forget what I saw. Nearly every corpse had been horribly mutilated. Can I ask you... what are you doing here in the jungle? Hunting. Hunting is my whole life. You couldn't imagine the sacrifices I made to set up this expedition. You couldn't imagine how I feel when I stalk an animal. Or the satisfaction I feel when I find it. And kill it. Why didn't you go to Africa? It's less dangerous there. Are you kidding? That's not hunting. They put you in a Land Rover and drive you where you can find... the animal you want to kill and that you paid for. Then it's just a matter of pulling the trigger. Not for me. It's completely different here. First, this is unexplored land. Second, we share the same risks as the animals. A man can become prey. Just like it happened with you and the snake. Does this tribe you're talking about really eat human flesh? Yes. Yes, if it's the tribe we're looking for. They're cannibals. They kill, butcher and pull out the insides of their victims. The heart is the first thing they eat. By doing so, they believe they'll absorb the victim's courage and qualities. Then, if they're not too hungry, they leave the rest to the animals. I'd prefer it well done. Come. We can't go on. We can't risk putting the lives of Isabelle and Sister Angela in danger. It's too dangerous. I reckon we should go back and set up a new expedition. If it really was the Yapiaka, then something must have really upset them. Maybe it's the girl from the asylum. Maybe she's more important to them than we can imagine. Or maybe... We should have told Wilkins about the mission. He'd have contacted the authorities to arrange a search party. I guess I won't mind going back to New York. I really wanted to do this story... but it's become more than we bargained for. I couldn't sleep. McKenzie, after what you told us about the mission... we've decided we'd better return to our main camp. This way we'll bring Isabelle and Sister Angela to safety. I think you should do the same. It might be dangerous to stay here. I don't think so. And I've always got my rifle. I came here to hunt. If I have to shoot men, well, it's the same to me. Thanks for asking me but I'd rather carry on. Well, I think we'd better get some sleep. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Goodnight. Where have you been? Answer my question. To get some fresh air. Is that what you call it? You're a whore. And you're impotent. - You said it wouldn't happen again! - Well, it happened again! Let me sleep now, I'm tired. I want to talk. The professor and the others want to go back. We can't. We have to go on. Of course, and that's what I told him. If tomorrow morning he asks you the same, you stick with me. We cannot arouse suspicion. Don't worry, Donald, I'm with you all the way. Let's sleep now. Come, quick! Manolo is dead! Let's go! Quick! I just found the body! It's the Yapiaka, there's no doubt. They took the boat. It was probably a few of them, otherwise they'd have attacked us. Rotten bastards! Our boat's gone, too! The compass, the supplies, everything! It's too dangerous to stay here. You'd better come with us. We'll follow the river in order not to get lost. Let's go. Just take the essential stuff. Alright, we're coming with you! How will we find it again? Now we gotta think about our survival. Then we'll find a way to lose them. It won't be easy without a compass. What about piranhas? Don't worry, the water's too shallow. Be careful, there might be anacondas around. Yes, but they aren't aggressive. Everything alright? Yes. Something stung me! It hurts! Where is it? Here, it stung me here! It's a bot fly, very dangerous. Its eggs dissolve into the skin causing gangrene. Be strong. Damn, if I could have a drink, at least. It's the wreck of a boat. It doesn't look like it's been here too long. - Look, Isabelle, it's a bible. - Let me see. And here's a blanket. Father Morales! Don't worry, it's a small snake, it's not dangerous. Help! Help! Mark! Mark! Manolo, cut down a branch! Don't move, Isabelle, don't move! I can't do it! I can't! Quick! Grab on to it! Hold tight! Hold tight! Come on! Quick! Quick! Come on, come on! You're safe. I found some fruit. It'll make you feel better. Get some sleep, Salvador. It's my turn on sentry duty. Yes. - Mark! - Quiet! Mark! What are you doing? Have you gone crazy? You dirty bastard! That's enough! Mark. Come on, Mark. Where are you going? - I'm going to... - Wait. Salvador. Go with Sister Angela. We're probably safe in the middle of this clearing. - They'd have to come out in the open to attack us. - Come, quick! The nun has disappeared! Quick, the nun's disappeared! She went behind the trees and vanished. I went to check, but... Let's go! Let's go! We must stay together! Be careful. There might be more traps. Felipe... Poor guy. It's too dangerous going on at night. We'll move at dawn. Very well. Help! Help! Don't move! Otherwise, we'll be all dead. How many bullets we got left? About a dozen. Don't forget we also need them to hunt for food. Look, a piece of Sister Angela's dress! They must be close. Why haven't they attacked us? Maybe they want to pick us off one at a time. Donald, please! They want fresh meat, that's why they do it. It's pointless to go on. It would be madness. By now, the cannibals will have already digested Sister Angela. - You listen, McKenzie. - No, you listen, professor. Fate brought us together, but now we'll do as I say. Forget about it. I just wanted to tell you that... Forget about it. Donald... What is it? Look. What could it be? Don't you see? It's a piece of the plane. We're close. Professor, my wife has convinced me to continue searching. Maybe Sister Angela is still alive. Calm down! Damn it. The river must be this way, but we'd better camp down for the night. What's got into you? I'm trying to find a way to lose them. Keep walking. You can get some sleep, Lester. I'll take your place, you haven't slept for two days. Alright, wake me in two hours. Good. That way. We must be close. Today I saw something in the trees. There! We found it, look! At last! Let's find it. Look under the seats. Poor Larsen, what a horrible way to die. We finally made it, Margaret. We're rich. Now we'll just have to survive. Yes. We'll make it, believe me. I'm holding on to the diamonds, so I'll be sure you won't leave me behind. I won't leave you, Maggie. I've also got back my manhood. Yes, dear. Salvador! McKenzie? Donald! Donald! Where are you? Donald! Let's go, follow me! Lester! McKenzie! The Yapiaka? Yes, we gotta chase them, they got Maggie! - They got my Maggie! - No, that's what they expect us to do! Let's try to make this radio work instead, damn it... Damn it! Hello? Hello? The plane crashed two years ago. It was returning from a diamond mine. I was working with them at the time, that's why I know. That's why we came here, to find the diamonds. But now those bastards took them along with my Maggie. Forget about the diamonds. We've got lucky, some of this stuff might be useful. A flare gun and a life raft. We'll look for Maggie. Hello? Hello? Please answer! It's useless, I've tried all the frequencies. I'm sure their village is on that island. If that's where they brought Maggie, they won't sacrifice her until the morning. That's because they believe their God won't be able to find her soul in the dark. We'd better wait until dawn to cross the lake. Do they always make these sacrifices? Just on special occasions. They've probably used some apena, a hallucinogenic drug... that makes them violent and aggressive. They usually use it for tribal rituals. Maybe we'll know more tomorrow. Hoping we'll make it. Let's hope so. The night's been quiet, but now those bastards are starting to move. Look at the fires. Is everything clear? We split up once we get on the island. McKenzie, Isabelle and Salvador will take one side. Emanuelle and I will take the other. We'll be guided by the sound of the drums. We'll get to the village in two parallel lines. I'll shoot a flare to confuse them. It will also serve as a signal to attack. Is that clear? If luck'll be on our side we'll manage to save... poor Maggie. Only then we'll rush back to the raft. Let's go. We'll go east. Alright, look out for the signal. Good luck. That way. Look, that's our boat! Come! Untie the canopy! There's some fuel left. There, in the cage! That's Maggie! If I remember correctly, that's a fertility ritual. They're going to celebrate the full moon for three days... and make sacrifices to the water goddess. Donald must have arrived by now. Run! No! There's too many of them. It'd be the end of us if we attack them. Let me go! Let me go! No! No! No! No! Let me go! Maggie! Maggie, no! Let her go! Bastards! Maggie! Maggie! Damn you! No! Let her go! What are you doing? Stop! No! No, stop! No! No! Stop! Let her go! They're carrying Isabelle. She's probably been drugged. And I think I know why. My God, now they'll kill her too! No, if this is what I told you... they won't kill her now. Look! Every year they take a pregnant woman as a symbol of fertility... and then they sacrifice her to the water goddess. They're gonna kill her later, on the beach. But she isn't pregnant. Look at what happens now. Let's get out of here. Let's try to rescue her, at least. This is the sacrificial stone. We've got to act fast. This is where they're gonna kill Isabelle. Listen, I've got an idea and I think it might work. I'm more and more convinced that the girl in New York was involved in all this. Did you notice that she looks like Isabelle? What do you think of my plan? It's crazy. There's nothing else we can attempt. We cannot let her die as well. It's gonna work, you see. The Indios are very superstitious, you know that. Let's exploit my likeness to them. By the time they find out we'll be out of here. They'll believe that the water Goddess has come to take her victim. Alright. Let's try. It's time. Go. Good luck. Give me the stick. Now swim as fast as you can. Quick, get in! Come on, Isabelle. Damn it! It won't start! Wait until they're in range! Now! We made it. Here, put this on. I never imagined I'd be able to shoot a man. They say us journalists will do anything to get a good story. I guess I should be satisfied I have enough material to write a great article. This won't be the case. Manolo, Felipe, Salvador, forced to follow us like slaves. Because of their poverty and maybe the color of their skin. Sister Angela with her vocation. Maggie and Donald with their mean-spiritedness. It's not our fault. It's the price of civilization.
