In the summer of 1986, I ran sound for a Christian heavy metal band. - You guys suck! - You suck! - Go home! - Ah! Get off the stage! Jesus loves you. And he can forgive you no matter what you've done! - What are you doing? - Can he forgive you for playing so many shitty songs? I know, I know, Christian heavy metal... people think it's a joke. You suck! Go home! And it wasn't a joke to me. I loved it. Until Christian heavy metal... Well... ...it went and broke my heart. Tell y'all what. It's been an amazing talent show tonight. Check, check, check. Now, we've got one more act for you. But before we do that, we've got - a couple of announcements... - Erik! ...before we pack up and head home tomorrow. If you are on the blue bus on the way to camp, you're gonna be on the red bus on the way home. Uh, it's only fair, okay? We need to take turns with the air conditioned coach. I'm dying up here, Erik! Y'all ready to rock? Awesome. First up, if you are allergic to bees, and were in cabin four when the attack happened on Thursday afternoon, if you are still experiencing symptoms like itchiness, tightness in the throat, soreness at the sight or sights of the stings or if you are still unable to hold your food down, you need to see the camp nurse tonight after the show. Alright, she's got calamine lotion and gator gum to keep you hydrated. Puppetine rehearsals start next Sunday night right before the special baptism service. Now, if you've ever been touched by a puppet... do yourselves a favor, get involved with this incredible ministry team. Yo, Erik! So, who's ready to rock? I can't hear you. God can't hear you! - Y'all dudes ready? - Waiting on you, cat daddy. Are you serious? These guys like to call themselves 316. But you and I, we know them as Michael, Jamie, Cliff, and Scotty. - Dear Father... - Playing the song by the band Stryper, and closing out this year's Camp Harmony talent show, 316! ♪ Ahhh ♪ ♪ We're gonna rock and have a good time ♪ ♪ Let's light the life, we move together ♪ ♪ We will stand to rock the land ♪ ♪ We're gonna rock for something new ♪ ♪ We're gonna rock for something true ♪ ♪ Tonight's the night so let's lift up our hands ♪ ♪ Jesus ♪ ♪ King ♪ ♪ Kings of kings ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Jesus ♪ ♪ Makes me ♪ ♪ Want to sing ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ He makes me wanna jump around ♪ ♪ He keep my feet up off the ground ♪ ♪ Tonight's the night, it's best to rock the land ♪ ♪ We're gonna rock for something new ♪ ♪ We're gonna rock for something true ♪ ♪ Tonight's the night so let's lift up our hands ♪ ♪ Jesus ♪ ♪ King ♪ ♪ King of kings ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Jesus ♪ ♪ Makes me ♪ ♪ Want to sing ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Jesus ♪ ♪ King ♪ ♪ King of kings, yeah ♪ ♪ Jesus ♪ ♪ Makes me ♪ ♪ Want to sing ♪ ♪ Jesus ♪ ♪ King ♪ ♪ King of kings ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Jesus ♪ ♪ He makes me to sing ♪ The '80s: now that's when Christian rock really started to roll. What started as sweet Jesus folk songs on a beach in California had grown into record labels, tour buses, Christian rock stars. Everybody's heard of Amy Grant. She was the most famous. But Stryper? A Christian hair metal band from L.A., they were my favorite. The youth of America have welcomed them with open arms and ears to their messages. They're known to break tradition with a hammer. As they perform, they distribute Bibles to all their audiences. Millions of American kids love their music that loud and that frantic. And they're either gonna go see Motley Crew or The Rolling Stones, or maybe Stryper. Guess who I'd rather them see? We had at least one Christian band for every three dozen or so regular bands. Righteous rock and rollers singing about sin and salvation instead of parties and sex. Christian rock's answer to the sleazy excess of the devil's music was simple. Jesus Christ will love the hell out of you. This summer, your father took us to Washington, DC. Do you remember? You liked the cemetery. You didn't wanna leave. You just... ran and ran back and forth through those rows of white crosses. You didn't realize there were soldiers buried there. You just carried on like it was a playground. ♪ Do with all his life ♪ ♪ Ba ba ba ba ba ba ♪ ♪ We believe, we believe with our hearts ♪ I went to church three times a week. You going on the mission trip? Studied my Bible. Pretty much ODed on Christian music. Think so. Harry says there's lots of people need to get saved in Niagara Falls. Sounds about right. I didn't play or sing, but I knew how to make music sound good. So I got on with a group of guys from my church who'd started a metal band called 3"16. Can you share your testimony with us? How you came to know Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior? Well, I went to a youth retreat last fall. And I rededicated my life. I mean, I walked an aisle in second grade, got baptized, but it wasn't really real until a few months ago. Mm, I hear you, bro. When Jesus gets ahold of you, man, it just changes things. Amen. Yeah. I rededicated my life two years ago at camp... again. I mean, I got saved when I was six. First rededication at ten, but... I was way off. Did my own thing all through middle school. My history teacher caught me stealing tater tots out of the cafeteria. I hit the ground pretty hard, rock bottom kind of stuff, you know? Eventually, the Holy Spirit... grabbed me by my high-tops and said, "Hey... are a child of God or aren't you?" Got back on track. After a couple of shows, our youth minister connected us to an old friend of his, who managed Christian bands. Skip. Well, folks, I work for a company in Chicago called Harvest Concert Ministries. We book concert tours for gospel groups, promote 'em, manage the bands. Now, I've been doing this for seven years now, and I have seen this industry absolutely explode. When I started, it was with Petra doing shows in... well, in fellowship halls just like this one back in '79. What, um... when you say Petra, do you... you mean like Petra, Petra? Good friends of mine. Great guys. On fire for Christ. I just saw Bobby at GMA in Nashville couple weeks ago. Listen, if what Perry told me is true, I see no reason that you boys can't be opening for... Mylan or Steve Camp or, who knows... maybe even Stryper by the time school starts back in the fall. I am here to steal you from your mamas and daddies for the summer, take you out on the road, cut an album, see what happens. You're... you're talking about a tour? Yes, Ma'am. 316 on tour. All four members and a soundman. the rock and roll road show. Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition. I honestly didn't think we were strong enough Christians to handle Skip's rock and roll road show. What about spiritual accountability? I mean, all the big bands travel with pastors. And they have Bible studies every day... and rules, too, you know? Like, uh... no girls on the bus, stuff like that. Perry told me you boys put Jesus first. What's your name, son? It's Erik. Soundman. Brother Erik's concerns... yeah, they echo the greats. You don't get into this business to party hardy and rock and roll, drink Bacardi and smoke a bowl. No. You do it... to spread the good news of Jesus Christ, to make Him famous. Your soundman, well, he sounds pretty dag-gum good to me. My mother though, well, she was sold. You trust Perry. Skip is Perry's friend. But out there on the road, just us guys? It's us I don't trust. ♪ Jesus, Jesus ♪ Set the table. I mean, technically, this was my dream. I'd imagine being on the road with a Christian rock band ever since I got saved at a Fire Escape show. We have all fallen short of God's perfect standard. And it's only by his son, Jesus Christ stripes, those Roman whip marks across his back... his sacrifice on the cross... that we can escape hell's fire. Tonight, if you wanna be saved from that fire, you need to pray this prayer with me. With every head bowed, and every eye closed, say this: dear Christ Jesus... I know that I'm a sinner. Dear Lord, bless this food to the nourishment of our bodies and our bodies to your service, in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Father God, open the eyes of Erik's heart that he could see the opportunity that you've placed before him. Lord, help him to find the honor and using his talents to glorify you. Amen. Mom really had a way with praying. If you don't go, they'll find someone else. The only reason I'd ever do it is to make Jesus famous. Home sweet home! Joy Explosion? My sister has every single one of their records. Oh, good folks, sweet harmonies. Love Jesus, and apparently, each other. So, there were some moral failures. But I know their ex-manager, so I got it for a song. The same rain falls on the just and the unjust. Amen. Amen. They look creepy. That's the eyes. They follow you. Hey, it's just art, man. Let's get the drums in first. - Alright. - Flip! - Hey! - Let's get in the druggie van. So you got clean socks, clean underwear. Listen to me, you just, um... you take this money, and you hide it in a bunch of different places just in case you lose some of it. Yeah, that's smart. Okay. And there's really no need to tell any of the other guys that you have money on you. Especially not that, um, Skip. Scotty'll just eat cereal if you don't watch him. He calls it ree-ree. He has to be in bed by 10 at the latest. I mean, he can be a real turd in the morning. Ma'am, we will have him in bed by 9:45. Alright, at least he doesn't wet the bed anymore. Yes, Ma'am. ...to be a permanent scar on the American promise of hope and opportunity for all. I'm talking about the crisis of family breakdown, especially among the welfare poor, both black and white. In inner cities today, families as we've always thought... Love ya, Mama. And so began the summer of 1986: an inauspicious gathering of wannabe rock stars in a church parking lot in West Columbia, South Carolina. Your Uncle Dan was so impressed when I told him about the tour. He said if you guys get up near Philly, he'll spring for Cokes. They're good boys, Erik. They might mess up. We all do. But if you're gonna mess up, it's better to do it with friends who love the Lord. Remember... Matthew 18:20. I mean, stuff like this just doesn't happen anymore. Sometimes, I wonder if it really happened to me. Five of us in a secondhand RV headed to who knows where, who knows when. Got it? We won't mess up, Mom. ♪ He said that he had your number ♪ This is the story of all that. ♪ You say you need it ♪ Or at least as best as I can remember. ♪ There ain't much time ♪ Putting together what actually happened several decades ago... ♪ Kept knocking on the door ♪ ...I mean, this story may only be true to me. ♪ It was over ♪ ♪ You were a prisoner of war ♪ But still, I'll try to keep it honest. ♪ But when you lose, you win ♪ Even if it makes me look like the devil.

On the radio, songs are played with lyrics like... "Gonna have me a white meat feast, "living large as befits the beast. "Discurtive scritch-scratch, dropping that crotch crotch, looking for a slick lick." "I ain't asking for much." But Paul tells us to be ready to thwart the influence of the devil wherever it shall rise. So, tonight, our young people will praise God through the hard rock of the 316 band.

So, we're going around tonight asking people what they thought of the show. Of course we know 316 was great. Oh, yeah, the John 3:16 band was... Just... just 316. Oh, okay, the 316s were rocking awesome. So, it's not plural, actually. - Just 316. - Oh, I said... There was talk awhile ago they were gonna maybe force me to do a television ministry. You? You on TV? I thought maybe a fishing show. Oh. Oh. Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. For just a quarter a day, I tell you, just a quarter a day, Brother Wember here will sneeze into a prayer hanky for you. You know, you can laugh, but I think during allergy season, I would have made a killing. - Ah! - Stop, stop, stop! Wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh, oh! - Here. come here. - Not the face! Ooh. Stop, stop, wait. Okay, welcome to our interview. - We're gonna... - You guys... Do you like popcorn? Because I have some. I actually I do like popcorn, It hurts. Go, go, go, go, go! I'm the baby. It's Daddy, me, Bethany, Sarah, and the oldest, Helen. Oh, sorry, but Helen moved. Oh, where's your mama? She died. Oh, well, what was her name? She was... Dot. Dotty.

Wherever Skip says. Are y'all famous? I don't think so. Not yet anyway. - So you... - I mean, I... think we stay with the preacher if the gig doesn't pay for the hotel. So you're calling my daddy a cheapskate? Well, yeah. Cheers. - Ow. Alright, okay. - I know. Ow. Ow. Ow, quit it, I gotta play tomorrow, okay, base is really hard. Quit whining, Samson. Keep your hands straight. - I'm keeping 'em... - Ah. I wouldn't wanna be up front. I love it. Yeah, but you have to keep your ego in check. Make Jesus famous and not yourself. Yeah. Do you have a girlfriend? No. Have you ever had a girlfriend? Not so much. Oh, well, um... it's... it's probably better that way. Daddy says he misses mama, but he does better ministry as... a widower. And Jesus never had a girlfriend. Except maybe Mary Magdalene. They never did anything. Why are they naked? Becky Jane? Hey, Skipper, can we stop at like a rest stop so I... - Alright, just hang on. - ...the bathroom? Brother Wember. Well, I appreciate what you're doing to take care - of what's owed. - Thank you. Listen, I want you to know... I feel real, real bad about what happened last year. It weren't your fault. You got involved with some bad hombres. Now, these boys, they're gonna need all the help you can give. May God bless you on your mission trip. Thank you very much. I wanna go to Panama, too, Daddy. Well, maybe when you're a little bit older. Not... no, Becky, we need you for a much more important job. We need you to look after your sisters. Amen. Jim H Christmas, can we go? Scotty, get back. Everybody, shut up! Alright, let's go! Thank you, brother. Arrivederci. Everybody, shut up! We're on the move. Scotty! Yes, your wickedness? Yeah, I mean, we still have over an hour to Mobile. We're not gonna be stop for lunch. Why don't you go back there and grab some grub from the cooler? Thought this thing had a refrigerator. Well, shocker, Scotty, it is not in proper working order. Should be a cooler behind the bass amp. Ahh. Uh... I don't... I don't see it, Skip! Oh, come on, Scotty, just look! I know it's back there, Scotty. Should be behind the bass amp. - Hey, Skip! - Yes? Think we better stop for lunch. Well, thank you so much, Ma'am. Alright. Well, Panama Jack's plane left Birmingham an hour ago. Sarah, have you run away before? No. Not in a while. Never got this far. - Daddy doesn't care. - Oh, he cares. Believe me, Sarah, he cares. God almighty! Shut your damn mouth, Scotty. I mean, we have to be in Mobile in... 53 minutes, or we can kiss that love offering goodbye. No money. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna call your daddy's secretary. We're gonna tell her the truth. We're gonna say we just found you after we were already there. Where are your sisters while your daddy's away? With my aunt and uncle. - Okay. - In Ohio. - Ohio? - Cleveland. It's near Akron. On the lake. Yeah, I'm very well aware of where Cleveland is, Sarah. - Yeah. - I tell ya, you all are gonna drive me back to drinking. Hey, Skip? She can sing. She could open for the band. I mean, she's really good. Yeah, she's awesome. Hey, sing that song from last night. I do not want to hear her sing. Yes, you do.

"I can't believe it's just been a couple of months since I tried out for the band." So, uh, what kind of music do you listen to? Quite a bit, actually. Uh, love metal, hard rock. Love your guys' stuff. Um, let's see, I've been listening to Res Band, Barren Cross, Blood Good, Leviticus, Jerusalem, Messiah Prophet, Philadelphia, Barnabas, uh, Daniel Band, Shout, and Saint, which I think is the heaviest of 'em all, of course. Um, but I could hear you guys playing with any of them. I've been listening to this new metal band called For Strike. Their album was produced by Mike Roe of The 77s. I love The 77s. That whole post-poc, new wave scene, bands like Youth Choir, the Lifesavers, and LSU, which is the new version of the Lifesavers, and it's insane. Uh, Undercover, Vector, Charlie Peacock, Bill Mason Band, uh, Mad At The World, Andy McCarol and Moral Support, The Technos, N3D, Quick Flight, 441, um, Steve Taylor and Daniel Amos, of course. And even punk stuff like The Lead and this new underground band from Texas that I heard about at Cornerstone called One Bad Pig. And... and then there's the mainstay Rock X. You gotta love them. You know, Larry Norman, uh, Randy Stonehill, Daryl Mansfield, Servant, Petra, DeGarmo and Key, uh, Rick Cuah, Prodigal, uh, Carry Lifgrun and AD, Idle Cure, Sweet Comfort Band. Um, Phil Keggy, Rob Castle's band, White Heart, Kenny Marks, Mark Heard, Pat Tiery, and then all that great stuff from the old days. My uncle threw me on to some crazy cool Jesus music that I still really dig, like Keith Green, All Safe Freaks Band, Tom Howard, Concrete Rubber Band, uh, Randy Mathews, Brinne Hayworth. He actually opened for Clapton. Ishmael United, so many others. But you know what I really love is when I find a regular band, uh, you know, like on MTV and the radio, that just has like a Christian perspective on things. I've been really into Bob Dylan, The Alarm, uh, Simple Minds, The Call, uh, After The Fire, Bruce Coburn, Violent Femmes, this wicked metal band from Chicago called Trouble, um, Alpha Band. They actually backed up Dylan. And, uh, Kasha. That's what was left after the lead singer left Kasha-googoo. it's way cooler. And U2, of course. Oh, and I've been getting into this jazz fusion band called Quinania. That's just what I carry around with me. I've got a lot more at home. Um, what... what was the third one again? I came on kind of strong. I'm glad they liked me anyway. Last night, we played at a youth camp somewhere in West Virginia.

I think he went to drive kids back to the church for the lock-in, says they can't sleep in a roller rink. Did you know that this is where we're supposed to stay tonight? It's the rock and roll road show. Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition. But, hey, you know, on the bright side, you just opened for the hottest band in Northwest Georgia. One song. Well, it was amazing. You sounded better than the band. Even Skip said so. You swear? Well, I mean, I don't swear... but I promise. So... I promise. You sounded better than the band. I taped it. You can listen. I have more songs. Well, then you've gotta sing those too. All of 'em. And I'm sure eventually some girl will catch my eye, but for now, I'm focused entirely on my spiritual growth and development. It's quiet time? Yeah, just finishing up. Hey, man, there's coffee at the gas station across the street. No, I never touch the stuff. You're so good. Come on. I think Cliff ate the rest of Scotty's ree-ree... again. I'm hoping we stop soon. I'm getting hungry. Not me. Feasting on the word this morning. Oh, you're so good. Do you think Skip drinks? Do you mean does he drink now? Scotty says he can smell it on his breath. Well, Scotty needs to tighten up his drumming. What do you think of Sarah? Well, she can sing. Well, yeah, but... Are you in love? Every time I turn around, there's another Christian rock star or music industry person. Skip tries to act like he's my dad. He's just being a boss, man. My boss is a Jewish carpenter. Hey, Skip talked my dad into letting me stay. That was cool of him. Skip's last band owes your daddy money. You're a free opening act. Do you get that? Hey, Skip and I agree you were pushing. I mixed the show. - Skip's a drunk! - Hey! And you're so full of shit. Hey, can you cut the language, Scotty? It hurts your witness. Don't you walk away from me, Scotty. Where's Cliff? Cliff is doing what I asked him to do. Unlike you. He's manning the merch table. Look, you have a problem with the rhythm section, maybe the bass player should be here, too. Okay. - Where? Did you eat him? - Alright. - Where is he? - Sarah, go. Take Cliff's place at the table, please. Go on. God almighty. Scotty, I am not... I'm worried about that kid. He's right though. I'm just Skip's way to settle up with Daddy. Hey. Stop worrying so much about how you got here or what some hothead teenager thinks. It's not about you, Sarah. Alright, God choose you for a reason: to make Jesus famous. You will not speak to me in this manner. If you do it again... Shut up! Turn the music, I need to sleep! You understand? I need to sleep. It's 3 o'clock in the morning, turn the music down! He's been slaying in the spirit, Cliff! Well, I need to sleep, you poo face. I guess we better turn in. Or try to. Well, uh, us guys are sleeping out by the skating rink. Um... And if I don't get some sleep, I don't play bass. And if I don't play bass, you don't have a band! ♪ Got no rhythm, got no ♪ So you could take, uh, skate rental if you want. Or whatever. Whoo! Hey, Sarah? I'm really glad you're here with us.

You know, I read in "Ladies Home Journal" that she would never want to compare Gary's moans to another man's. I'm serious. She talks about them like having sex and stuff, and drinking wine, and walking around on nude beaches. That doesn't sound right. I have the magazine. It's in there. It's just like when you were talking about us in Nashville... just kinda made me think, you know? So... I don't know. Okay. Alright, we get two songs, that's it, no cover. Hey, did y'all see Mylan? 'Cause I got him to sign my hand. We'll play "Commando" and "Barabbas." Alright. You nimrod, that ink's gonna sweat right off you. Alright, don't go over, guys. Do not go over. "Commando" and "Barabbas," that's it, alright? Scotty? - Strict time. - Strict time, yes. - Hey, Skip Wick. - Yeah. We didn't get any pizza. You know, if I could stop time, Cliff, and get you some pizza, I would. But God has not given me that particular gift. Alright, Sarah, Erik, let's go. You guys, break a leg. Whoo! Alright, let's go! Couple thousand people, he's worried about pizza. It's unbelievable to me. Oh. It's Amy Grant. Hey, it's me. Yeah, I'm... I'm Skip Wick, uh, Harvest Concert Ministries. Hi.

Jamie Van Halen. - Ah! - Alright. I'll make this short and sweet. Got a call yesterday from an old friend, works with the promotor in L.A. They want 316 for a booking hold! Yes! What... what's a booking hold? When a promoter pays you to clear your schedule for a potential gig. They heard the songs from the Nashville session. 316 is in consideration for a support lot on the Motley Crew and Stryper Heaven and Hell Tour! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Then why the hold? They wanna see you gig with a secular band. Like in a real rock club? Purgatorio, Dallas. Split bill with a couple of other metal bands. Santa's Clutch. Is that a Christmas band? No, you moron, it's Satan's Clutch. Dude, these dudes are crazy. They're like from Sweden or someplace. Norway. It ain't the Bill Gaither Trio, that's for damn sure. But, hey, that's what these L.A. guys wanna see. 316 in the belly of the beast. And if the club owner gives a good report, you guys are in. You're gonna blow 'em away! And when you get to L.A., you're gonna blow Stryper away, too. I wouldn't be surprised if you get signed on the spot. Skippy. Oh. I'll call you tomorrow with the details. Ooh. Well done, my man. Thank you, Chris. I for one am... I just... I can't believe it. Yeah, Satan's Clutch, that's... that's the band that... they bit the head off of a ferret. Gross. The Purgatorio... I mean, if you want to... I mean, this is a real rock and roll club, alright? I don't know. I'm not sure I want this band playing a venue where they serve alcohol. Hey, Skip, I kinda agree with Michael. I... Chris is right. This band's the real deal. And this opportunity to play 316 songs in a real rock club filled with... filled with lost people, guys... This is what it's all about. Look, I don't know about you. But I'm tired of preaching to the choir. These churches and camps... I mean, half of these people, they think all rock is evil. They don't wanna hear our music. We should play somewhere where they do. I wanna make Jesus famous. Amen. So I say we rock the hell out of this... - Pergatorio. - ...Pergatorio. Amen.

I wanna speak to my lawyer. Yeah, that's a good idea. Why is he keeping us here if he's off duty? To make sure this case of assault and battery doesn't turn into a homicide. Why in the name of all that's holy you felt compelled to give an alter call at the end? We're screwed, Michael? And what's this bullshit about you signing away our publishing? - Jamie, will you just shut... - Shut up, Scotty! I wanna hear it straight from the dumbass! Huh? During the Bloody Mass set, a guy came up to me and asked if we had signed with a publisher. I said I didn't think so. And you did what? I told him we'd look into it. You didn't write those songs, Cliff! Okay, first of all... I'm the only one of us that's of legal age, that's why he was talking to me and not you. You understand? Second, publishing is the only way any of us in this business make any money. And third, I wrote the riff on "Girl." I wrote some of the words on "Commando." Yeah, "Yahweh M-80 rocket launcher," that was mine. - Right? - Oh my. - Right? - It was stupid. We agreed Skip Wick would handle contracts. Yeah, I couldn't find Skip. He was probably banging someone's mom in the back of the station wagon. Come on, let me into the garage. Yoo-hoo! I'm home! Yes, everybody! Remain calm. Everybody, please, calm down. Stay in your seats. There is no crying here. I am sorry that I missed your show. Boo-hoo-hoo, Scotty, alright? Now, I had to go over to the Howard Johnson's for just a few minutes, and it turns out, they are completely booked. So, lucky me, I met this very nice Ukrainian woman who runs an adult establishment in Irving. Go, Cowboys! And she has spare rooms for the girls who come in from out of town, so we are set. You're welcome. Thank you, stay seated. It's alright, I understand. You're appreciative. I heard you guys rocked it, huh? You okay, Skip Wick? Am I okay? No, I'm not okay. I'm not okay at all.

You're the one that needs to go home. But there are people who are dying and going to hell. Can't God just be glad for us? Because we're happy and having fun, making music? Jesus is already famous, Erik. He doesn't need your help. Uh. I promised to tell my story honestly. Well, this is where my memory fails. Endings are like that. Scattered, fuzzy, falling to pieces. 316 died that night. But just before the end, I'll never forget it. We played the best set of our career. Hey, how 'bout a do-over? My last set was for Jesus.

Michael actually stayed with Christian music. He made a couple of really good power pop records in the mid-'90s. Went on to lead worship at a megachurch out west. Cliff, he's in sales. Not sure what he sells, but he does well. Lives in Atlanta. We've run into each other a few times over the years. Great guy. Scotty's been married two or three times, I hear. Doesn't play anymore. Not sure if he goes to church either. I think his new wife just had a baby. They seem happy. Jamie made it. He became a session guitarist in L.A. He was in a couple of fairly successful rock bands, too. I saw him play in Charlotte once. We spoke briefly after. He was nice. But it was clear. He'd moved on. And me? Well, I stuck with the youth group through high school, then kind of drifted away from church in college. I got married, divorced, started an AV company that I eventually sold. I lost my ear for rock and roll. I grew up. We all do. And the past becomes stories we tell at bars, on first dates, playing a round of golf. Every once in a while, I do think about trying to find Sarah. But I never did. When I finally heard about her again, it was too late. Hi. Hi. Um. I'm Erik. Yes, I know. You were with the band. I was. Yes. Sound guy. Yeah, I remember. It was all such a huge part of my memory that night. Oh. We played a bunch of shows. Well, there was one here in Aniston. Christian Life Assembly. You all stayed at our house that night. Oh yeah, of course. Sorry, how could I forget? Well, I was the bratty younger sister. I'm sure I gave you guys a ton of grief. - I was pretty boy crazy. - Becky? Yes. Rebekah now. I'm surprised you remembered. Oh, well, um... she talked a lot about you. Um... You guys were the best thing that ever happened to my sister. I heard so many stories about Skip Wick over the years. Well, you know he sold cars for a while. Of course he did. I'm in Houston on business in the late '90s, and I'm looking at this local TV station. There's Skip Wick. No way. Looking right into the camera, showing those used cars. - That's perfect. - Awesome. So the next day, I go down to the lot and I found him. - You're kidding? - No. I walked right up to him, he didn't recognize me from Adam. But it was him, no doubt. Was he still driving, uh... what is it... - the Joy Explosion? - Yeah, with those eyes. - Remember that? - They were awesome. Well, what did he say when you told him who you were? - Uh, I didn't. - What? No, I didn't. I just chatted him up about cars, and I told him I was looking for a minivan for my wife. Oh man. I would have loved to have seen his face if you'd had told him. Well, I got close. I kept asking him if he'd ever driven an RV. Come on! Told him my wife was into Christian hair metal. - Oh man. - Come on. Dude, he must have known it was you. Maybe. But he never let on. He just said he loved the Lord too. Skip Wick. Skip Wick. Hi. Hey, I wanted to catch you before you left. Yeah, of course. Thanks. Oh, sorry. It's okay. I wanted to give you something. Sure. A few years ago, when Sarah finally moved back... Daddy was pretty sick by then. And, um, she knew all these music people so... Music people? My sister. She had an amazing career. You didn't know that? I... I kinda gave up on music a long time ago. Sarah sang with everybody. She toured with Michael Jackson, Elton John, and I mean, everybody. She toured the world, Erik, half a dozen times. Wow. I...
