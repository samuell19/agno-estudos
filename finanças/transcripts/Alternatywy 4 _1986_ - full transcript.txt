He told everything to the Angel and they both think they can insult me ​​now just because I'm a stripper. And Angel is me he even blackmailed. It's a livestock. And I earned a flat. I started working right after high school diploma when I was 18 years old. And in two years I collected as a contribution but they raised the prices so I kept working. And this is a terribly unhealthy job, because a lot of smoke and at night and I was still cold. And after three years I put together again but they raised again. And now I will have a month and people say something about increases. How much can you do? I will ... I will go on a pension and I will keep doing this striptease. Mrs. Ewa, Mrs. Ewa. Please don't cry. Ewa, I will construct such a robot, who will do striptease for you and he collects and for an apartment, he collects and for car. And maybe something else will remain, right? Please, don't cry. And ... the robot is not aging. There will be delivery tomorrow. Don't push everyone the order applies! # You got stuck in red, # # in blue spell # # The water was called, # # floors taken ... # # Go crazy, # # blue, green. # # On the red holiday, # # on blue holiday # # On the green May holiday! # # Hello May dawn, # # Shine our Polish land. # # We celebrate you with a song, # # Which is famous all over Poland # # Hello May, Third May! # # A blissful paradise for Poles! # What is this?! Stop! Enough! Enough! I knew it would be so. I knew. One wise man he warned me! You are politically irresponsible! These can be terrible consequences. Terrible! This is adventurism! And this ... jeopardizing. That's why the chorus is over! - Well, home, children, home. - Wait, who said the end ?! Mr! Who dismissed you ?! Sit me down! The attempt will be until 21:00. Please state! Now, there won't be a choir there will be ballet. Well, white tango, ladies please, gentlemen. Good good! Enough! I say enough! We are going to dance folk dancing. In a month we have the Amateur Festival Dance Bands. And if we all apply ourselves, we have a chance for a passing mulch. I will not dance! I can't dance, besides I am on my feet in dance. - Let my wife testify. - Yes. Yes! Mr. neighbor as usual can not. {y:i} But as if you had to drink half a liter please, huh? A bit of culture. There is also a package from America to my place. Dr. Furman told me. All right, all right. It is Mr. Kitten who can give one there a lighter dance to ... no partner, no it was ... trampling. And the professor is just a little too long language, and too short eyesight, no? Or maybe it was all about for doctor Can i speak So I have a very easy proposition and not tiring dance, even for professor. So it's Polish walked. A well-known melody, "yield we bear yield, in the host's house ". At the beginning the dancers bring in joyful dumps a huge loaf of bread, a symbol of abundance and prosperity our land, which to all her children distributes justly and generously - fruits of their joint and several ... - Shhh. - effort. - OK then. Yes, we will see there again how will it be with this ballet, maybe those out there czastuszki ... Already! All right, you'll see. Zara, wait a minute! I remembered something. I wanted to communicate to you that a person lives in our block, which is not worthy of being called a tenant. Wait a moment, but before I say everything, the children will leave this room. The kids go home, they won't be there you told me home now. Mom, I know everything. As you know everything, it's mommy at home you say everything. Already, already! Tom! An unbearable kid. And home, home! I need you regret to communicate that we have in ours block normal ... I will not be nervous and I will not use words ... but this person sells his body anyone who wants it. And this person is unfortunately ... ... Mrs. Ewa! I think you exaggerated. Do you know that this is public slander? Do you have any evidence? Mrs. Ewa! Children, please leave here right now, please. - Ewa, wait! - Ewa! Here is the bill amounting to PLN 6250, which Mr. Furman personally published. Is not it sufficient evidence? - Something, you paid her so much? - Yes... No. Not hers the waiter. Mr. Furman was in a restaurant recently category "S" - "Kongresowa" and saw personally Ewa she was getting naked in public! And I already thought that this is normal tuff. And I felt that she was an artist. But by the way it's not nice that she was hiding so. She could give some cheaper tickets. Tadeusz! Don't you dare me! To home! Now now! Well, good stuff. These artists earn a lot, don't they? What stupid thing are you saying? How do you know such things? Are you hanging out with the artists? There's a poor piece there bread, pennies pay them. I think it's finally very much nice girl. My niece too occurs in such a team ... song and dance. And they praise her very much there. What are you telling me? I thought right here we will make a petition some condemning resolution, some we will write an application for eviction! I have to get it for these performances. {y:i} - Mr. Furman. - Yes? Mr. Furman, will you say something? I have a head ache. Head? Head! I'll tell you something. It's like a plague! What I'm saying is like a plague! For example, here's the main tenant out of four, I will not mention the name, {y:i} with a sub-tenant from under six, I will not mention the name ... {y:i} Well, you came with you in serious extramarital relations! What's so serious! And what's more, culinary delights our current market problems ... - What? Did they eat together - And they ate. They ate ... and how. How could you, honey? do this to me I wanted to help you. Help? That's how you wanted to help a woman You wanted your own wife this way help? You don't understand anything. How hard-working she is. I wanted you to have help. You know how now difficult to agree housekeeper. And what they have requirements... They are degenerates! Degenerates and perverts! Ready to make our house a block public, or worse. Not adults. Just not adults ... And the program is right! But with such people hard to do it! I'll be damned! - Staś, doctor to you. - Let him come in! So what about this package? - You are cheated by everyone. - Vicks ... He says he is an addressee it might as well be a kitty. And that nobody is harmed, then you have to write a letter to the sender, who he meant. And this package was sent by some ... seven adventists one out there day from Alaska. It will be half a year before this letter arrives, and during this time the food will go to hell. You couldn't get along with this crane? You say the package is for him and that you don't blame. The angel will deliver it to him, and we will then we divide it in half. It is always there better than nothing. The angel said he could divide a packet for two equal halves, but what is odd or indivisible will be for him, you understand? Look ... Divisible, divisible. Divisible, divisible. Odd, odd, odd. I prefer it throw it in the dustbin! Zygmunt, but you don't know what could be in this package. There can be cream there, chocolate, maybe even ham? Or washing powder ... no, no.

One cousin told me what was that in america means how could he say because he is there in America by mistake on a hangover he drank hydrochloric acid. So how could he say he told me that ichni the constructor too invented a robot like that. Apparently she was alive. But he didn't predict one. Well, like this powder box he let go into the city after some time she came back with a belly. And she didn't even scrape herself, because she says she is a practitioner. {y:i} You are talking nonsense. Let me not leave this place started to tell the truth. And you don't know this life at all ... Quietly! You don't know that there are things about which the homeowners were not dreaming. I speak quietly! They go, they go! Now they are definitely coming!
