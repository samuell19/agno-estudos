What's the problem? You know what's the problem. It is nice. Rhythmic. I don't like it. It unstrings me. Why not work with something more... pop? You're not ready for something more pop. If you really want to know what the real problem is, I'm going to tell you. The problem is you don't trust me. The problem is... you believe I'm not yet ready for something more pop while I am. If you raise your voice to me again... I'll take a juggling club to smash your head. And, then, I'll break your arms and legs. And then you won't be able to work with "something more pop". In fact, you won't be able to work with anything at all. Either rock or fox-trot, either latin or whatever. I know very well when one is ready for pop. I'm sorry. You know very well when one is ready for pop. What's your name? Mary. Mary or Maria? How do they usually call you? - Mary. - I'm going to call you Maria. Have you got any brothers and sisters? No. Maria, you have been badly hit. The chances of dying are high. If I asked you now to pick an actor, whom you'd say? Who's your favorite? Well, I'll tell you names. If I find it, wave to me. Brad Pitt. No? Johnny Depp? What? Not even Johnny Depp? We've brought a young girl, around 16 years old. Car accident. Internal haemorrhage, broken ribs. She plays tennis. Maybe for several years, cause her racket was quite lightweight. Was she taken to surgery? Yes. - Any relatives? - Her parents are notified. Where's she going to? To room 205. OK. She has no brothers or sisters. Her favorite actor is Jude Law. OK. Brown-haired? Blonde? Brunette? Dark brown, though her head was covered in blood... I think, dark brown. - Do you want some coffee? - Yes. - There's inside. - Shall I take your cup? Only for today. Tomorrow, I'll bring mine. What's yours like? I'm asking for not to mess it with another that looks alike. Blue with red letters. What's written on it? "Los Angeles". No, there's no other like it. In these occasions you need stay calm... however hard it's what I'm saying. - Have you got any other kids? - No. Everything's going to be all right. She'll make it. She seems a tough nut to crack. She's a sportswoman. She plays tennis. That's very good. I play tennis too. I've surely suffered an injury that held me back... but for the last two years I'm getting better. My wife is a former tennis champion. I don't want you to worry. We're going to do everything we can. You're daughter is going to be all right. She'll come back to the tennis court sooner than you may realize. And you won't even remember all this. I want you to make me a favor. This is her favorite wristband. She used to wear it in every match. I want you to give it to her. It will give her strength. I don't know if it's allowed to wear it. There's no problem. You may give it yourself to her whenever you see her. Thank you. Hi, dad. You're late. It's just five minutes to ten. It's 10:10! - There was heavy traffic. - I was worried. I'm sorry. I don't mind that you're being late. Just warn me about. I'm sorry. I go to bed. Do you want me for something else? Tomorrow it's going to rain. Take your jacket with you. OK. Good night. Good night. Today is a special day. As you know, we've been long looking for a good-sounding and suitable name for our team. After a lot of thought, I ended up... ...to the name "Alps". Alps? Yes, Alps. Why Alps? Alps, for two important reasons. The first one... it doesn't by any means reveal what exactly we are doing. And the second one is purely symbolic. No other mountain can stand in for the mountains of the Alps. Anything else would be smaller and less imposing. Therefore... ...a poor substitute. What is amazing with the mountains of the Alps is... that while can not be replaced by any other... they can stand in for all the others. Who could mind seeing in the place of Ararat or Mount McKinley... the Alps? Would you mind? Neither could I. Besides, I will take the name of the highest mountain of the Alps... which is called Mont Blanc. What about us? You may choose names among the smaller mountains. Do you know them? Monte Roza, Dom... Weisshorn, Matterhorn... Finsteraarhorn... Aletschhorn... Barre des Ecrins... Gran Paradiso, Piz Bernina and one more. Weissmies. I've printed copies for you. I'd like to take Matterhorn. That's good. Why? It reminds my father. When I was very small, we had gone there for excursion. Where to? - Matterhorn! - In Switzerland? At the foot of the mountain. Good evening. Good evening. Just a moment. I'm coming. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. - Take a seat. - Thank you. I've brought you the list you asked and the photo. Very nice. - Don't you have a closer one? - Unfortunately no. - A captain. - A captain of the merchant navy. These are sub-lieutenant?s badges. The photo is old. I couldn't find a more recent one. He used to wear glasses. I couldn't find them. But you have to. I'm going to look over again. We can't replace them with others. It wouldn't be plausible. I'm going to look over again. Zachos. Yes. Any relation with the chop-house in Varkiza? No, no. It's just a coincidence. Did you know each other for years? We were friends for about 20 years. From higher school. Cause of death? Heart failure. Favorite food? Not something special. Maybe he liked spaghetti a bit more. Plain spaghetti? - With tomato sauce. - Alla Napoletana. Yes, alla Napoletana Don't get upset. He was using very frequently the word "yet", before any sentence. That is, he was saying "yet, today it's very windy". Or "yet, see you later." Or "yet, today it's too cold." Got it. Favorite foreign actor? It was Morgan Freeman. He liked going to the movies alone. He went to see all his movies. He was usually going alone. Is it too small? - Yes. - I think so, too. We'll have it remade. Is it that your hair is too thick? No, it's not that. My friend had no hair. - Does this bother you? - No. I don't think so. No. Very nice. If he wore glasses, he would be completely different. I'll look again. I'll find them. - You have to. - I'll do it. Hello! Darling, Anna came. My beloved friend. Come on. Take a seat. What a pleasant surprise! I wasn't expecting you. - I missed you. - I missed you, too. Anything you want? Some tea? - Tea. - Good. - Come on. - Thank you. How are you? - I'm fine. - I'm glad to hear it. Hello there. How are you, Anna? It is so long. We've admittedly missed you. I'm all right. - Isn't it a fine day, today? - Indeed. I go to the office. I've some important business. - Will you be late? - Yes, I'll be back very late at night. Good! I'll make your favorite food. Schnitzel with mashed potatoes? Perfect! I don't know what I could do without him. You're very lucky. - Do you want me to read for you? - Yes. I'd like it. A book or a magazine? A magazine. "Fashion trends of the Summer" "Gianfranco Ferre: The King Is Naked." "Trip to Guatemala: Exotic and unknown." - "Interview: Winona Ryder." - This one! "Tell me how do you start your day?" "If I'm not working, I get up around ten o' clock... and prepare a cup of tea. Then, I sit down and read NY Times. For the rest of the morning I make my phone calls... and arrange several tasks. When I am in Los Angeles... some times, I take a long walk around my house... either to refresh myself or in the evening to relax." I've got a surprise for you. Close your eyes. Do you like it? Isn't it awesome? Sorry. It's amazing we've become friends. Would you like me to sit next to you to talk just for a while? I want you to know that whatever you have to say to me, I won't say a word to your parents. It's going to stay between us. Are you possibly pregnant? Don't get upset! After all, you are too young to have a child. You got a lot of time ahead of you. Now, you must focus in your homework and tennis. I also want you to know that if you were pregnant you shouldn't dye your hair. It's too dangerous. Besides, your natural color is very nice. It's dark brown, isn't it? What happened? Nothing. What happened? I couldn't say something I had to. What was that you couldn't say it? "Grandpa look here a nice cup for your coffee or your tea." And Grandpa, what did he do? He got upset. And you? Me? Nothing. I left. Don't speak to Mont Blanc about it. Please. He won't give me the girl with the car accident, if you speak to him about. You're the King of the coaches. You're the best... You're the best coach in the world. It is impossible not to say it. I'm sorry. It is wonderful! Is it cold? No, not at all. Come out now. It's getting late. We have to leave. Just a little longer. Please. A little longer. All right. Cold is a word but winter swimmers don't know it. It's an odd fate that you can not eat ice-cream. Because of your diabetes. But you hate chocolate anyway. I would have a different flavor like strawberry which is my favorite. There's no point to talk about it. The doctor was quite clear on it. You're right. How about a walk on the beach? That's a wonderful idea! Light fittings fall into three main categories. Domestic interior, domestic exterior and professional. Then, there are various subcategories... such as ceiling lamps... shade lamps, wall lamps... modern chandeliers, classic chandeliers... rack-lighting, uplighters... spotlights, pendant lamps and floor lamps. Repeat them back to me. Wall lamps, ceiling lamps... classic chandeliers, modern chandeliers... uplighters... floor lamps, table lamps.... And pendant lamps. And pendant lamps. Uplighters... and uplighters... Once more in the evening. This evening we have a ball. - What types of dances do you dance? - Various. Blues, tango, waltz... And latin? And latin. - Nice. - Will you come? I will come. Are you ready? Now. Your daughter lost in the most important... ...the most important match of her life. I'm very sorry. My condolences. Nonetheless, keep in mind... death is not the end. On the contrary. It is a new, often a better start. Your daughter fought hard but the opponent was stronger. She was a remarkable person that everybody will remember. I'm sure about that. And now, I got something very pleasing to tell you. I myself can replace her if you want it. You're grief will ease and after a while... will disappear completely. A couple of two-hours visits a week are enough. The end can be a new, better start. It's up to you. For the first four visits you won't be charged. "Grandpa look here a nice cup for your coffee or tea." As soon as Granma sees it, she will surely feel jealous. but never mind... because I bought her a gift too, this wallet here... which has a coin compartment and a photo holder. "Grandpa, look here a nice cup for your coffee or your tea." The girl with the car accident is getting much better and doctors say that she has overcome the danger. They speak of a miracle. What a pity. Indeed. Again. "Grandpa, look here a nice cup for your coffee or tea." As soon as Granma sees it, she will surely feel jealous but... never mind because I bought her as a gift this wallet which has a coin compartment and a photo holder. However, you lost a great deal by not coming. It was wonderful and the view from the room was amazing. You won't be paid this month. I'll keep your money. Repeat and clearer. "Grandpa, look here a nice cup for your coffee or tea." As soon as Granma sees it, she will surely feel jealous... but never mind because I bought her too... What's the matter with her? She made a mistake. Has it happened before? This is the second time. With the grandpa again. The man who cut my hair for the last twelve years died yesterday. He had no relatives. I went to the hair salon today and he was not there. He was the only one to cut my hair. No one else. He was always taking care of my side-burns to be at the exact same length. Both of them. - Are they now at the same length? - Don't know. They're not. I've not gone for a long time. I never fixed an appointment without him being there. I was on any occasion arranging it when he was there. - Are you going to attend the funeral? - No. - Why? - I don't go to funerals. - How did he die? - Heart failure. You danced very nice. Thank you very much. Your escort was amazing too. We always dance together. Do you know each other for a long time? Almost five months. Do you like her? She's very likeable. What's the time? I didn't know you are so good a dancer. We used to dance with your mother as well. Save for latin. She hated latin. You should always tie your hair back. - These are not tennis shoes! - I see. What is your shoe size? Thirty-eight or thirty-nine. As the case may be. This is incredible. This is perfectly fit to me. Incredible. That's her perfume, "Eternity". It was a gift by her boyfriend. You have to meet him someday. I was quite sure I will drive her off. I knew it. Her reverse forehand was lousy... I knew it right from the start she was hopeless! Do you want some water? No, dad. Thanks. You usually drink a plenty of water after the match. It's OK. Thank you. Bite your nails a bit. That's enough. I like last replacement a lot. - The blind one? - Yes. She lost her vision at an old age. She hasn't ever told me how. She's a beautiful woman with vivid colors. What do you mean "vivid colors"? Green eyes, light brown hair. A peculiar combination. I go to her house, in Athens center, a maisonette with yard. She hasn't much furniture not to stumble. - We sit and I play her husband. - Yes, I know. And I tell her stories for hours. She likes them a lot. Whatever comes to mind. Sometimes, she asks me to kiss her. And we kiss. - Do you like her. - I like her a lot. I'm having fun. I mean, do you like your kissing. Yes, I like it. She's an active woman. Imagine you were blind. You couldn't do rhythmic gymnastics. Get out of here. Collect your things from home and leave. Go back to Toronto, go wherever you like... so long as I will never see you again. Fuck you. You are so controlling. You make me miserable. I'm only thinking of your health, idiot! But I don't care any more. Leave and then eat all the cakes and all the deserts you like. I will leave. Get out of my sight. I don't want to see you again. Get out of here. Collect your things from home and leave! Go back to Toronto, go wherever you like so long as I will never see you again. Fuck you. You are so controlling. You make me miserable. I'm only thinking of your health! But I don't care any more. Leave and then eat all the cakes and all the deserts you like. I will leave. Get out of my sight! I don't wanna see you again! I'm sorry. I love you. I love you too. I'm only hard on you for your own good. I know. If Mont Blanc learns about, there will be a problem. Our collaboration may be over. He won't learn anything. I for one won't tell him anything. Let your blouse. Take off your skirt. - The pantyhose? - Take off the pantyhose, too. Try not to speak loud. To be nearly inaudible. There will only be a moment when you are going to say "Please, please don't you stop." It feels like heaven." That's it. Please, don't you stop! It feels like paradise. Heaven! Please! Don't you stop! It feels like heaven! Please, don't you stop! It feels like heaven! He said we are never going to work with something more pop. - Why? - Don't know. But I can't stand it any more. What you were about to do it was completely immature. You're a very good gymnast and it would be a shame to die. I'm going to speak to him. Thank you, Monte Roza. You imagine that's very difficult for him to step back. But there's nothing to lose giving a try. Do you want any specific piece of music? There are two pieces for me to choose. I'll do anything you want. Let her work with a piece that is more pop and I'll do anything. - Anything I want? - Anything you want. Think about it. I thought it over. - Tell me. - Come closer inside. - Come on, Ok? - Yes. How could you do it? With my husband? You, my best friend! I hate you both. Shame on you! Get out the way! You have a nice body. You, too. - Are you getting cold? - No, not in the least. I've turned the heat on but it's a bit slow to warm up. I don't mind. Dad, want to dance with me? Not right now. Some other time. - In the evening? - In the evening. - You promise me. - I do. I have to leave. Stay a little longer, please. All right. I say not waiting for her. She probably won't come Agree. She's too late. Who's first? May I go? A man or a woman? A man. I keep waiting for a while. - I don't know. - Neither do I. - It's Prince. - Who? Prince. You can't replace Prince. - Why? - Prince hasn't died yet. - Prince has died. - Prince is alive. I'm sorry. You didn't come to our yesterday meeting. I know it. I was just needed to replace a colleague who had something to do. Here. That is to say, you were here. Your cup is cleaned up. Didn't you drink any coffee all night long? I did used it. I hope you don't mind. No, it doesn't bother me. Not at all. I couldn't find my own. Anyway it's a shame you didn't come yesterday. It was so much fun. Junior replaced Prince who hasn't died. Isn't Prince dead? No. He's not. Have you ever seen anyone drinking from my cup? That one with the red letters that say "Los Angeles" No. As far as I remember. That's strange! You may take mine whenever you want. Thank you very much. I don't smoke. You better quit smoking too. - Nice shoes. - Thanks. I watched a movie yesterday with a veteran... whom they called for his last mission. While he wouldn't initially accept, then he took up arms and went. I think I've seen it. Mum, dad, I wasn't expecting you so early. Vasilis is a friend from school. All we did was dancing. - Do you want to go to my place? - Sure. Hi, dad. Here's Vasilis. Vasilis, here's my dad. - Hello. - Hello there. We're going to sit in my room and listen to music. - If you need something, say it to me. - All right. If volume's too high, tell me to turn it down. - All right? - All right. Volume is high. Turn it down. If you're getting cold, tell me to turn the heat on. I'm not cold. Vasilis is younger than me but we do match together. In several things. We got many common interests. Music, sports... We met at the hospital. He's a track & field athlete. In the 110 meter hurdles. In a race he fell down while jumping over the hurdle and suffered a fracture of the pyramidal bone. I helped put the splint on him and gave him a painkiller. He is also very good in arts. He plays the guitar. They make some covers. With his band at school. He is the singer and... Hi. Who is it, darling? A schoolmate, mum. Unfortunately I can't come with you. I have homework and after that... I must attend a very important tennis tournament. See you tomorrow at school. We're going to make a test. We're going to use this object. If it doesn't change color and stays white, that will automatically mean you are competent and reliable to stay with us. If it changes... there are two possibilities. First. It becomes blue. If it becomes blue, that will automatically mean... that you are competent but not reliable. So? There's no "so". It doesn't matter becoming blue. I said it just like that. The second possibility and the worst is... this club to become red. This will automatically mean you are unreliable and incompetent to stay with us. Let's see. It changed. It became red. Unfortunately, you must leave. Drink it up before the ice melts away. It was very nice. Who was mother's favorite actor? Robert Redford Mine, too. Her favorite singer? Harry Belafonte. Yours? Elvis Presley Mine, too. Nice shoes. Thank you. I watched a movie yesterday with a veteran... whom they called for one last mission. While he wouldn't initially accept, then he took up arms and went. I think I've seen it. Mum, dad, I wasn't expecting you so early. Vasilis is a friend. All we did was dancing. Nice shoes. Thank you.

Mum, dad, I wasn't expecting you so early. Dad, can you bring me some water please? Dad? I'm back. Can you open for me, please? I was very good today. 4-2 in sets. You're the best coach in the world!
