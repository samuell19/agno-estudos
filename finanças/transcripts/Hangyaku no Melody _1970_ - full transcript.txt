DAINICHI EIHAI CO. LTD. A NIKKATSU PRESENTATION We, the Tanno Family, as collaborators and members of society, have devoted ourselves to our business. Yet, we have made use of illegal actions to grow it, and thus received society's judgment. From now on, we pledge to limit our actions as much as possible, and do what is in our power to help society. With this, the Tanno Family is officially disbanded. Sincerely, the Tanno Family leader, Daijiro Tanno. Hey, don't overdo it. Stop acting like my superior, the Tanno family has disbanded.

Now, move your ass! Sir, would you like to make a bet? 10.000 yen on number 3 and 2. What? Here you are, sir. You got 9 and 1. Thank you. Put 200.000 yen on 3 and 2 again. - 200.000? - Yeah. Boss, he bet 200.000 on number 3 and 2! He's rich! - Keep an eye on him. - Yes. - Hey. - Yes? Are you a local? Huh? You're from the Tachibana Family, right? Yes. You lost this time, sir. I see, that's a pity. Yes. Uhm... you have to pay your 200.000. - In cash? - Yes, in cash. - I don't have it. - What? I don't have money for people like them. Boss! - He's refusing to pay! - Huh? Can you stop fooling around? We're from Yatokai. - Yatokai? - Yes. How strange. This island was Tachibana Family territory. - Right? - Yes. You fool! Every last one of the Tachibanas are slow. So, we had no choice but to take over. So? You get it, right? Now stop fooling around and pay up. Hey! I'll give the money to Tachibana group. I have no money to give to Yatokai. Y-You...! Sauna Wanna take a bath? - You from Tokyo, lady? - Yes. Did the Yatokai bring you here? Hey, do you want to sleep with her? She has a nice ass, doesn't she? How about it? Is that your woman? I picked her up a minute ago. You can have her for 5.000 yen! Come on, 5.000. I'm too cheap to give you that, idiot. - Cheap? - Yeah. - Oh! - Just let her go. - Huh?! - There's a better way to make money. Oh, the beard looks good on you. - Are you having fun? - Not at all. Hey, any ideas? Totally. - What is it? - Something to get rid of the stress. - Oh. - A lot of cash. You in? Yeah. Stop. Stop with that. H-Hey, you! You damn thief! A thief! Hey! Hey, stop it. What are you men standing around for? Sake. - Bring sake, you idiot! - Yes, sir! Stop being so slow! Hurry up! That country bumpkin. Pisses me off. Kaneda. That guy said the one in control around here is Tachibana group. Yeah. He said he was giving the money to them. I see. He's got guts. - Guts? What do you think... - Imai! Calm down. Saying something like that... must mean he's got some sort of connection with the Tachibana group. Do you have any clue who he may be? None. I'm sorry. Are you telling the truth? You're persistent. That's fine, then. If he has no ties to your group, then we can do whatever we want with him. I'm gonna take charge. That's fine. Go do what you want. What?! Hey, say that again! Hey! Idiot! You guys are too slow! Stupid bumpkin. Boss, Aoyama was hit in the head with a beer bottle and got two stitches. Why should we let him bully us? We don't work for them. Please hold back. It was my husband that called the Yatokai here. We are to work with them and protect our group while he's in prison. We understand, but this is basically a take over. Our boss must be crying in prison. Have you all thought about what would happen... if we were to start a war with the Yatokai? They may be aggressive, but it's just the three of them. There's 30 of us and yet we're bossed around. It's pathetic. It's just one more month until my husband gets out of prison. Just sit tight until then. All right? - You said your name was Gebasaku? - Yeah. That's what they call me. - Are you from here? - No. I just got here today. - Where do you live? - My home? I have none. Maybe that motorcycle is my home. Where were you born? Murora in Hokkaido. Stop it already. You sound like a cop. No job and no address. The cops must love you. Hey. Get out of town tonight, they're not stupid. You'd get caught by tonight. Hey, are we going separate ways? Yeah. Do you not like me? That's not it. I like you. I like you a lot! Get outta here. Hey, it's that guy! Get him! - Let me go! - Making a fool of us! - Come with us! - Let me go! Come! You bastard! Take that! This way! Tell me! Who is that guy?! I'm right here. Stop it! Why did you come to this town? Why don't you at least tell me your name? I'm Tachibana's younger brother. - Younger brother? - That's right. With different mothers. If you're Tachibana's brother, then you're from the Tanno group in Osaka. I think I've heard about it from Tachibana before. That's right. I'm an ex-member of Tanno. Ex-Tanno? What's the matter? Does that name frighten you? The Tanno group has been disbanded. So, killing someone has no consequences. We've been warned regularly by our Boss not to mess with the Tanno group. That's right, I understand it all now that you're from the Tanno group. You should have told us that from the beginning. I'm staying here for a bit. I'm going to look after the Tachibana group. You guys go back to Tokyo. We were asked by Tachibana... His younger brother is asking you to leave. There won't be a problem. All right? You get out of this town. Now go! Damn it! Bastard! Sir. Thank you for coming. Where are the men from the Tachibana group? What's the matter? Give me the culprit. - What are you talking about? - Stop playing dumb! You used a gun. If you make me wait passed morning, you're going to prison. If you don't want us snooping around, I suggest you give up the culprit. We may find some violations in operating a brothel. Come on, sir... You have until morning. Understood? I can't win with you. I understand. I'll hand him to you. Just don't put him in prison, please. All right, but... they're sending in reinforcements from the Prefect Office as well as HQ. Do you understand? Don't even think about doing something stupid with the Tachibana group and ruining my reputation. Do you hear me? Roses for a funeral? Never mind. Dotsuken would prefer something flashy, anyway. I'm lucky to have such an amazing wife. Cut it out. We're not officially married yet. Hey! Good work! Dotsuken! You got killed. You had a good boss and good comrades, too. All cowards. You must be crying in hell. - Hey. - Hoshino. The matter is settled. - Hoshino! - Don't act superior to me! That wasn't a cup of sake I asked for. They were so persistent that I drink the sake, and the relationship was advantageous for me back then, so I took it. I'll give you back the sake anytime. It has nothing to do with you. Don't mind him. I actually hate Dotsuken. I'm actually thinking he deserves it. But he was a relative of mine! I won't forgive the guy that killed him. Don't do something stupid. - The police are here. - The police? That's them? Calling the cops to a funeral? Is that a yakuza's burial? Aren't they supposed to be our enemy? Yakuza have become so pathetic. We've come so low. The people who invited you are pathetic, but you actually coming is just as bad, if not worse. Hey, can you arrest me? For assault. What? When and where? I'm gonna do it now. Right, and another one! Obstruction of justice! Arresting is justice too, right? - Don't do it! - Get off of me, you fool. Get out of the way! Are you a yakuza? Yakuza helping the police? What a disgrace! Let me go! You're so pathetic! It's so pathetic! Damn it! What kind of a low scum yakuza are you? Damn you! Move away! Let me go! Damn it! Damn it! What a disgrace! Move! Move! Move! Damn it! Damn it! Move! This used to be a beautiful beach. The surrounding may have changed, but I guess people never do. Tetsu, why did you come back? No, I'm actually happy that you're back. Our young ones are, too. They're all fired up because of you. I shouldn't have come back. The first thing that came to mind when the group got disbanded was this beach. I don't know why. It's not like I like it here. All these harbors and factories... The responsibility of Tachibana group just keeps growing. Say, Tetsu, won't you stay even after my husband gets out of prison? We need your help. Let him know that I have an urgent matter to take care of. Give him my best. - Yes. - The boss will be disappointed. I can't force my wish through. The Shotenkai takes good care of us. It's a good thing he can't have affairs in prison. And seeing him behind bars will only be frustrating. - I'm counting on you. - Yes. You haven't seen this guy since you were a kid, right? Are things going to go well? I don't think you need to hold back. Take what you want. What are you talking about? That woman. She's a fine woman. Really sexy. Idiot. Looks like she's into you, too. You should try her. It'll be good for you both. Stop talking, will you? You're pretty old fashioned, huh? You're a real simpleton. Oh, Tetsu? How's everybody? Are they doing well with Yatokai? Tetsu, I actually have something to talk to you about. A small restaurant. A low key place for porridge. - What do you mean? - There's a woman I want to gift it to. I'm planning to separate. With your wife? That's what I wanted to talk to you about. Brother, why do you think she's working so hard on her own? Yeah. I know, I know. But I... I don't want to hear such rotten ideas. I don't know how you came to rely on Yatokai. But I had them leave. Tetsu, what do you mean by that? We ended up killing one young man. If it doesn't make you happy, get really mad. If you want to cry, cry. You're all young. You don't need to hold back a thing. Get rid of those pigs. Kill them! Cut them up! Make those pigs suffer. Power. It's power! Violence! Go get them! Punch them! You all teach them a lesson. Get those self righteous bullies! We're on the side of the bullied! Those that have nothing going for them... Those are our people! Injustice, frustration, give it what you got! You can't forgive them. Don't let it go! Hey, is the president here? Who are you, people? - Please wait! - It's fine! Let us pass! Who are you, people? Why don't you at least knock? You stole the plot of land from Koshida clothing store, didn't you? We stole it? That's right, you lend money with high interest rates, and intended to take away the property from the beginning! No, I obey the law. If you have a problem, sue me. You may get away with the law, but not with us! - I can see your boobs. - Having a good time, huh? You pervert! - I'm hungry. - Why don't we order something? Right! The company's paying, anyway. Let's order whatever we want. Please, let me go. I'm begging you. I'll... I'll give you the money. You're giving this to me? Good, good. You can have the woman too if you want. Is this your woman? - I'm helping her. - You're such a pervert. Hey. Hurry up and speak up. You... you can't... no...! Come on, speak up! Thank you for your order! Here's your order! Just put it down there! Here. Thank you, thank you! - Thank you so much. - It's okay. The loan guy gave this to us, but can you gift it to us? - It's like a service fee. - Yes, of course. I'm really thankful. I thought laws didn't exist in this world anymore. Neither the court nor the police took me seriously. We're more helpful than the cops, right? You bet! - That's right! - Well, take care. Thank you so much! Hey, let's go! Business is good. You must be making a ton. Doing business is fine, but don't get too carried away. I heard you used to be a member of the Tanno group in Osaka. I heard the reason Yatokai left this town is because of you. You're like a star. By the way, we need five guns. - Guns? - Yeah. Don't play dumb. We already know. What do you mean? We won an award last year for gun control. So, the boss keeps nudging us to do better. - You get extra points too, right? - Of course. So, we got some from Yatokai last year. I'll promise that we won't look into where it came from. Just hide them in some abandoned house in the landfill. No, thanks. You shouldn't act so tough. Your husband's coming out in three weeks, right? I suggest you do whatever you want before then. Sorry to take your time. Tetsu boss, a phone call from Osaka. From Osaka? Is it Towa Construction again? Where are you going? This is police business. Hey, move! You hear us? Damn you! Since when have you been in Tokyo? I've had a lot of things going on. What does the boss want? In Tokyo, there's Yatokai, Ogata group, Ohga family, and others that haven't disbanded. We need to convince them to disband. You say disband like it's nothing, but, while it may be fine for the big honchos, the young ones have no place to go. Tetsu, that's just the flow of things. Sometimes, you have to let things go. In any case, we disband and work with the police. Tachibana group won't disband for a long, long time. - Welcome back. - All right. Yes. Are you hurt? - Seiji Takigawa. - That's Seiji Takigawa? There's still chances. It felt good just to scare him a bit. I may cause you some trouble. Hey, don't hold back now. You know, I love stupid idiots who seek revenge even after so many failed attempts. You don't hear such stories these days. Especially when the target is Tanno,. considered to be the best in the country. It makes me want to offer you help. I won't let you die in vain. - You should hurry. - Yeah. Thank you. They won't find you there. It's my friend's apartment. Do as you please. We're closed. Hey! You have Seiji Takigawa, right? I heard from Yatokai. Is that so? Can you hand him over? I don't have much to boast about, but there's just one thing. That I'm friends with Seiji Takigawa. - Do you know his story? - Yeah. He's a relative of a guy in a group that was destroyed by Tanno group. And for the past 5 years, he's attempted to kill Tanno five or six times. My father is like your uncle. Partnering with someone after your own uncle doesn't fly. Stop. Tanno group was disbanded. You and Tanno shouldn't have anything binding at this point. Your story is the one that doesn't fly. Go home! If you want to go up there, you go through me. Fine, I have a score to settle with you about Dotsuken, anyway. - Both of you, stop it! - Come here! Move, you bastards! Don't meddle! Damn it, you bastards! Bastards! Move! Get out of the way! - Let's go! - Wait, come back! Times have changed. Yakuza groups don't matter any more. Like Mineta from Tanno or Takizawa from Yatokai or so and so from Ogata group. Let go of such useless price and cheap, lowly mentality. From here on, we have to deal with one another as individual men. Otherwise, we can't keep up with the times. Just let go of everything in the past, and join forces together. It doesn't matter what you make it look like. It can be a construction, trading or transportation company. So many people say they will support us in our unification, by offering jobs and financial help, as well. Many in the financial and political world are willing to give us advice. We should be grateful. So, discuss amongst yourselves to disband the groups, and establish a new company. - You finally got out. - Yeah. Thank you for coming to get me. There was something I wanted to talk to you about. - Come on, sit down. - What is it? You know better about this. Why don't you tell him? One of your young ones is blackmailing Towa Construction for something trivial. I don't plan on punishing him if he quietly walks away, but I need you to stop him from doing something stupid. Towa Construction? I've never heard of them. It happened while you were locked up. They let us establish a subcontracting company. I'd like your help eventually, and I'll make sure Tachibana group is taken care of, as well. That's how it is, so we want to avoid any hassle for the company. Can you do that? We're asking you. I'm not the boss of Tachibana group. I can't give orders to the young ones. What did you say? I can't tell them to become a corporation's pet even if I die. Tetsu, Towa Construction takes good care of me. But I disbanded the group and retired. I won't tell you what to do. You do as you like. But even if the group is disbanded, the fact that he's ex-Tanno group stays with him forever. It'll cause you trouble. Wait! What do you plan to do? No clue! He's no good. That's his strength. Let him be for a while. What do we do if his young ones go after Towa Construction again? Whoever goes against Towa Construction will be killed. We don't hold back toward those that come after us. Hoshino, have you gone crazy? Stop! Stop it! You want Seiji Takigawa? What do you think you're saying? Since when have you become Tanno's dogs? Hoshino! - Calm down and listen. - Shut up! Get out! I don't want anything to do with you! Get out! You damn bastards! It's from a guy called Tetsu. He says he wants to talk. Tetsu? He wants to see me? Shut up! I don't want to see you. I'm not here! I don't wanna see your face. I'm not going. I'm never going! You're late. Late? - It's 11 pm like we said. - What are you talking about? If you really wanted to see me, you would have come an hour earlier. Huh? Look at me. I waited an hour. - There's something... - There's something... I think we may get along. I think so, too. So, I have a request. What is it? Have the Takigawa group take care of Seiji. They'll never suspect him to be there. That's why it'll be the safest. Please. You'll do it, right? It's 11:15 pm. Yup, 11:15 pm. We're friends now. What's the matter, bro? What are you thinking? You don't need to wait. We have the information. Towa Construction may be top class, but they're horrible. Do you want the townspeople to continue suffering? - Gebasaku. - Huh? - I used to be in the Tanno group. - I know that. What about it? Tanno's big boss told me not to touch Towa Construction. Is that why you're hesitating? I grew up with the group. Who cares? We take advantage of the name Tanno, then. Yato got scares just hearing the name Tanno. But you have nothing to do with them now. And that's how it should be. I want to fight them. I want to light a fire! Don't go after Towa Construction. Let them be for a while. Do you understand? Do you like me? I like you. And I also like the old man Tanno. You liar. How dare you bring me out here so early in the morning? I'm gonna faint from lack of sleep. You fool! The father was saved, but I feel badly for the child. It's fine to build a factory, but there have been too many accidents. Remember the accident the other day? A bird is singing on a dead tree I'm whacking hay A grandma in a Watabiki automobile The water wheel is turning, too Everything is the same as last year But there's something missing The sound of wood chopping The sound of wood chopping You! You're the guy that came with Tetsu from Tokyo, right? There's something wrong with Tetsu. Listen to me. You don't get it. If the boss says "black", it's black even if it's actually white. - Stop acting like a fool. - Really? I guess it's no surprise that you don't get it. Things are tough. I like you. Black even if it's white, huh? You're clever. But black is black and white is white. I can't let go of something I can't forgive. Why are all the young ones alone in the darkness? The real dawn will soon come But go to bed for the sake of tomorrow The big city lights are going out Why can't you go to sleep? You're not the only one that's alone But go to bed for the sake of tomorrow Believe in tomorrow and go to sleep You can't appreciate freedom unless you've been locked up for a long time. Right, Tetsu? Honey, Tetsu has helped us a great deal while you weren't here. I wouldn't have been able to manage on my own. Of course. I hear this town is no longer a small fishing village. There are harbors and huge tankers out there. There's no way a woman can manage all of it. Oh, that Mineta... weren't you two together at Tanno? Partners in crime, huh? I hear he's making good money with Towa Construction. The young ones are also not satisfied with you. The local people are laughing at us, too. - What do you plan to do? - Honey! You shouldn't meddle in men's affairs, O-Ryu. Excuse yourself. Yes. Everyone, have a good time. - Harue. - Yes. I want to start a porridge shop. Are there any properties available? - A restaurant? - Yeah. Shut up! You stay out of this. Tachibana. You don't need to answer now, but you should disband the group. So many of you guys showed up when you got released that... we got called in by the Prefectural Police Department and got an earful. They also got an earful from other departments and were extremely embarrassed. If you feel bad about it, disband. You made a complete fool out of us. Thanks a lot. That idiot. You two get him! - Yes. - Yes. You bastard. Wait, damn it! Take that! Let me go! Hey. Take care of him. Let go! Hey! Bro Tetsu... - Bro... - Gebasaku. It's me, Tetsu. I'm right here. I won't forgive them. I won't let them do whatever they want. I'll destroy them! Annihilate them. Hey! Hey! Gebasaku! Gebasaku! Death Certificate I don't know his name. I called him Gebasaku. I don't know anything about him. I know nothing at all. I heard he was born in Muroran in Hokkaido. That's all I knew. Once you're dead, that's it. Nothing matters anymore. You're forgotten and you disappear. - Bro Tetsu! - Brother, where are you going? - You didn't have to kill him. - Huh? Yeah, your young one got into a fight with one of ours. I gave the guy who did it to the police. You scum! Bastard... You should have told me where you were going? Aren't we friends? I didn't want to owe you. - Let's get rid of the Tachibana group. - Then, I'll gather men. Mineta, you're the president of a reputable construction company. What would a normal company do in a situation like this? - Think about it. - Yeah... You get it, right? You work with the police. That's the normal way. Watch the Tachibana group. If it looks like they're up to something, get rid of them. I'll say it again. We're destroying the Tachibana group. Hey, Aki. Aki. I think I may die for real this time. I've done everything I've wanted to. I have no regrets. But there's still one thing. I worry about you. Aki. If I die, you don't mind me. Just go find yourself a good man. Stop it. I'm done with men. I have no luck with them. What a cute thing to say. Let's hurry and go. Tetsu is waiting. It's fun to get into a fight with a guy you just partnered with yesterday. There might be a search on the way. I'll hold on to it. That's true. I'll be close by, so you can get it whenever you need it. Honey, what happened?! Honey! Damn it! Tetsu! Damn it. I can't see. I can't see. Tetsu! Don't die! Honey, stay with me! You can't die! Honey! Honey! Honey! Let me through! - Shut up! - Go away! You can't pass through today. What are you thinking? - Is the police playing go-between? - No, that's not it. I wanted to hear both sides of the story in detail. - That's why I called you here. - I see. Then, I've already said everything. Excuse me. Wait, I don't mean to be persistent, but Towa Construction isn't concerned about the past. We just want your cooperation on this project. There are plenty of jobs like security or as a subcontractor. No matter how many times you ask me, I'm not interested. Tetsu. This new project is to build Japan's largest steel mill. We're not doing it out of some petty yakuza pride. It's for a good cause. Don't make me laugh. I've heard that enough from these guys. We want you to understand. The prosperity in Japan is a surprise to many nations. But that comes with stress and restraints. And the ones carrying that stress are people like you and Mineta here. You use phony financials to steal people's property. And you pretend nothing's happened even when a truck runs into a home and kills a kid. - How do you live with yourselves? - Hey! Why can't you stop fighting and cooperate? Stop with the lies! The only people interested in making money here are you! It's got nothing to do with the poor. Hey, Mister. Do you think we'll stay quiet as long as you give us jobs? Tetsu! You're not gonna get it no matter what, huh? You killed two of my friends. Got it? I'll fight unless you make them stop the construction. A factory that requires the help of the yakuza shouldn't go up. Tsukada. The police from the Prefectural Department is asking you nicely. - Stop the nonsensical fight. - I don't wanna hear it. Well, just get along with the police and become their guard dogs. Wow, you stink. You're a stinking guard dog. There's a white dog and a black dog. I'm going now. Wait a minute, boy. Stop pushing it. You know what happens when you underestimate the police. We can bring down anyone we want. Assault, obstruction of justice, burglary, defamation. Traffic violations. We can arrest anybody for anything. You get it? This is your last warning. Don't make matters worse. Do you understand? How do you plan to resolve this? Money doesn't grow on trees. I'd like to know what you're planning. They're the same as the police. Towa Construction halted their construction, and it's just us not budging now. Towa Construction loses a lot of money each day when they don't operate. - I'm sure they'll make a move soon. - Are we going to wait until then? When they said they'll pay us for security, that was our chance. Do you want petty cash? Yakuza live on petty cash. Am I wrong? There are those that don't. The young ones were killed like they were bugs. I watched them die. Brother. If we listen to them now, there's no turning back. We don't back down until we settle this! Tetsu! Since when do you talk like you're the boss?! Honey. I don't feel good being here. I'm leaving! Say, Tetsu. I know it's a bit sudden to ask, but can you not stay here any longer? My husband is back now. You may be better on your own. I also think Tetsu shouldn't be here. You're the target. You should disappear. I see. Tetsu won't budge, huh? What a waste. - Then, boss... - Hey, Mineta. If Tetsu comes apologizing, don't kill him. - We can still use him. - Sure. A pet dog is cute when he's wagging his tail, but when he's become stray, and starts attacking left and right, there's no controlling it. - Sir, what do you want? - Listen. - I have a search warrant. - A search? Arrest him for obstruction of justice. Stop fooling around! Let me go! I didn't do anything! Let go! - Mister, what do you want? - Arrest him, too. What?! I haven't done anything! You borrowed money from a girl. You're under arrest for swindling! What are you saying? That's a lie! Hey, stop that! Hey! Let go! What did I do?! You hit the refrigerator! Under arrest for criminal intimidation! Violated traffic regulations? I haven't done such a thing! Let go! Let me go! Damn you! You're the one who is running the cafe, right? You're the owner, right? You played live music without a permit, yes? Take her. That's strange. Someone should be there. - Shall we go and check? - Yeah. No, you shouldn't go outside. I'll go. It's you. I'm surprised you're still alive, hiding in a place like this. I'm sorry. It's pathetic. I can't even go pay my respects to him. You were on his mind until he died. Friendship between men is amazing. I'm jealous. A relationship between a man and a woman is so fragile. I don't remember anything about him any more. Not even his face. You must think I'm lying, right? It's true, though. What do you plan to do from now? I got rid of the bar. I'm not sure what I'll do. Maybe I'll go search for a new man. Maybe I'll go on a trip. Aki... I'll take this with me, all right? Tachibana Group Tetsu, we put your brother down. Don't make any more trouble, understand? Tetsu... The police were here just now. You were safe, Tetsu... I'm glad. I'm really glad. That's right. They finally let me out. Because my husband died... We did something wrong. Because we're yakuza, the police can do awful things to us. We broke the law, so this is normal, right? But... But what did we do? I like you. I like you a lot! I want to fight them. I want to light a fire! Bro Tetsu, I won't forgive them. I won't let them do whatever they want. I'll destroy them. Annihilate them. THE END
