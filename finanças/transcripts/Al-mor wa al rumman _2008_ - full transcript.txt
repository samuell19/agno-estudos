We have to go, Zaid. The bride's will be well ahead of you. Come on, everyone's waiting. I can't work out this bow tie. We'll do that in the car. Come on. Time to go. We don't want to be too late. Come on now, my beautiful daughters! A bachelor was I, who enjoyed the freedom... A bachelor was I, who enjoyed the freedom... A bachelor gay was I, but now I'm getting married... All the toys are just 5 shekels! For your daughter or your son, only 5 shekels! Keep driving. - Go past the others? - Yes. Where are you going? I'm sorry, but I'm getting married. Go on then. Congratulations! Are you going to Jerusalem? Is this your licence? Get out of the car... Keep calm, Zaid. Wouldn't it have been simpler to have the wedding in Ramallah? When you were married, we had to go to Nazareth. The bride has to follow the groom, not the other way round. This is what Zaid wanted, so that's how it will be. You can go. A bachelor was I, who enjoyed the freedom... I'm sorry that we're late. I was thinking you'd changed your mind. And lose the best thing that ever happened to me? - I trust you're enjoying yourselves. - We certainly are! May God bless your marriage. You're such a handsome bridegroom! Come and have a dance. Go on, go dance with your son! If only your father had lived to see you and Kamar today. I feel the same. Is that how I looked? Who was dancing like this? You know I can't dance. I thought you'd taken lessons What are you doing? That was your dad's. Good morning. I didn't want to wake you. . What's the time? 12. Go back to sleep. I'll just go check the harvest workers and come back later. - Good morning. - Good morning, Mrs Kamar. Good morning our beautiful bride. So you're just checking... How's it going? We should look up on the hill. What shall I do? Things are quiet now. You can rest. Let me help. We need to hurry it up. Don't get worked up. We'll have it finished here today and do the hill tomorrow. That's Zaid's mum. Hi everyone... Sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Kamar! It's nice that you're back already. Some good news... I've finally come across a well-regarded choreographer... ...who'll coach you. - Who is it? - We need one. He's a Palestinian from Lebanon. Kais. What type of dancing does he do? Contemporary dance, but he'll work with our traditional dances. So let's get started. We can't lose any more time. I hope this new guy can inject something new into our dances. - When is he coming? - In a week or two, maybe. Hullo. I should have brought more pickers. Otherwise, we won't be finished in time. Don't worry... you'll be first for the mill. OK 'Bye. Odeh! Yeah? - We must get more pickers. - Let's go then. Sorry darling... but I shan't be late. Do you have rehearsal today? Do you have to go? Yes, we're rehearsing before our show. Today's the last harvest day. I would have liked you to be there. I'm coming. - Hi everybody. - Hi. - Don't forget, 4 o'clock tomorrow. - I'll try! - I'm very sorry. - Where have you been? I left the studio and town was empty. There wasn't a bus or taxi anywhere. I told you how important this was for me. Everyone knows that the situation on the streets is bad... but you had to walk. Did it never occur to you... that could be embarrassing for me? Everyone is wondering "Where is Mrs Kamar?" You have to get your priorities right. Stop it now... Don't be angry with me. We'll go home now. Everyone's waiting for us. - Where have you been? - The main thing is they're here. - Things were quiet this morning. - You know it's a problem in town. There's a lull now, and they are here. Eat now, so your family doesn't believe that we starve you. I have to say, Zaid, that I don't like this situation. And it looks like getting worse. What more can happen? They're everywhere. You just never know.. But we seem to have got used to it. Here's to a really good olive harvest. This year's harvest deserves a drink. Let's drink to that! Zaid! Look! Wait! - What do you want? - Get back! This is my land. What are you doing here? We have a confiscation order. - Do you understand him, Odeh? - Something about a confiscation order. A boy threw a stone at our patrol. What boy? What are you talking about? Stop it! This is my land that's been in my family for generations. Stand aside, this is not your land! Let go of me! - Let him go! - Zaid! Zaid! Get back! get back! Zaid, my son, don't worry! God bless Abu Zaid! Nothing's missing. All taxes are paid, everything is here. Look after these papers. Here you see... What have you got, Odeh? Kamar, ring this number. Everything here is in order. What's missing? Dad, take these papers. Perfect. The last land tax paid, signed and stamped. Quiet... she's answering. Keep still or we'll really fuck you! We'll rearrange that face of yours. You're gonna pay, you piece of shit! You hit a soldier, you dog! Do you have a permit? When can we see Zaid? Right now he's under interrogation. When the interrogation ends, you can ask for permission to visit him in prison. - Have you met him? - Yes. Interrogation? How is he? Under the circumstances, reasonable. They charge him with attacking the soldiers invoking the order of confiscation. They have no right to be on our land. That land belongs to Gabriel Hanna Elias Saeed. I'm very impressed you should understand, but you know... ...that these other papers are military orders. They confiscate lands, not only your lands, but lands all over. What we are going to do is appeal the confiscation in the courts. I don't know if you will win, but I assume they will offer you also compensation they will compensation. Do you think they can buy us off with money? I'm not saying... I'm not offering you. This is not my position. I support also the positions of those Palestinians over so many years... to refuse to get any compensation for demanding the houses... And you should understand it might ease the release of your son. Find another way, please, to get my son out. I will try my best. CONFISCATED LAND Is his name there, this time? Damn the lot of them! Get out of bed! What time is it? 6 o'clock. - Good evening. - Come here. Not so late. Umm Zaid has his troubles with Zaid and the harvest. So it's still early. It's dark.... Not so, Odeh? Be strong in front of Zaid. Don't cry. He has worries enough, without that. - How are you? - I miss you both. We miss you even more. You know, you should never have come. I could I not do it? I count the minutes till we see each other again. The whole town would've come if they could.. And Kamar... how are you? Fine. Tell me how you feel. How do they treat you? I feel fine. I really do. Administrative detention is different to prison. Except where it concerns food. I'll never complain at home again. Never, I promise! Pray to God you'll be home soon. Are they hard on you? I said I feel fine. You can see me. I brought some thyme and oil for you. Has all the oil been delivered? Odeh is seeing to it. Tell what the lawyer said. She'll be going to court next week. Tell her not to waste time, other than concentrate on the land confiscation. Of course. Don't worry about it. Sooner or later I'll be let out. But if the land's gone... ...then everything's lost. Make sure Odeh tells our buyers that the harvest is ready. See Umm Habib. She knows Abu Fawaz who knows all the buyers. She'll give you his phone number. Don't you worry. Ahmad! Stop kicking that ball and screaming! I've got such a headache! Come inside and give me a hand! - Hi, Umm Habib. - Hi. Kamar, my pet! How are you keeping? How are things with Zaid? You needn't say anything. I know how hard it must be. God help you both! I need Abu Fawaz's number. Who is Abu Fawaz? He ships out the oil. Damn you! No damn me, for letting you work here. Fetch a broom before I wipe the floor with you. - Abu Fawaz... - Yes, I know. Am I a charity now?! Fetch me my telephone book. Just get out of my way! Let's see... Abu Fawaz. Here it is. Tear a strip off that. Hurry up! 05 42 35 61. May God spit in the eye of those who brought you such bad luck. Thank you. I must go. Umm Habib, when shall I come with your oil and your olives? Give me a week to clear the shelves. Very well. - Are you off so soon? - I'll be back. My regards to Umm Zaid. I can try and appeal the detention... But you should understand that a soldier's testimony... in a military court, is solid gold. Solid gold?! But what those people are saying is simply not true. This is their way and technique to divert our attention from the major thing. What really matters to them? The land! We are running around, concerning the military reports concerning linking the soldier, and petty things like this... ...while they are taking the land. What are you going to do about it? We've already achieved an injunction order from the court... ...preventing them totally from building on this land. They have already put a tent. If the reason for the tent is a security reason, there's nothing I can do But the moment they will start digging... I can action the settlers. This will be a moment too late. Here I come... with some goodies. Like one? - I made them just for you. - I don't feel like anything. Now you've made me unhappy. Have some. You too. - Coffee? - That's yummy! Don't worry, that's good luck. Is that good? Why aren't you at rehearsal? This is no time for dancing. But Mum, look at her. She's miserable all the time. It's good for her to be here. People just see her as the wife of a prisoner. What do THEY know? She hasn't done anything wrong. We can't not care about what the people here think. But Mum, think of HER. I don't feel like dancing anyway. Go grab some things and stay with us for a few days. Hi everybody! - Rasha, how you lie! - You and Rasha are still in danger. Great to see you. We've missed you. Come and meet Kais. This is Kais... Kamar. Now let's show Kais one of our best dances. - Yousef told us a lot about you. - Really? Are you in the troupe? Yes. Nice to meet you. I have to go now. Goodbye everyone! From the beginning again. The US administration has insisted that the peace process... As if there'll ever be peace! - Hullo, Umm Habib! - That sounds like Yousef! How are you? - Are you filling in for Zaid? - I'm trying to. - Hi. - Hi, Kais. - Chickpea pasty with Umm Zaid's oil. - Coming up... Come and eat with us. I'll just finish up here. This has been my favourite place for several years. May God preserve your beautiful hands! Aren't you the flatterer! I'm in your hands, Umm Habib. "Ln your hands!" Sure...! I see a handsome man... Who might he be? I'm Kais, son of Abu Ghassan. - Abu Ghassan of the fairground? - One and the same. - Is he back? - He died in Beirut. - May God bless your children. - He's not married. Fix us a pot of peppermint tea. Right away. Ahmad, stop kicking that ball! Is there a playground nearby? The whole town is a playground. They play on the streets. Listen to them! We've been paid for the olives and the oil. Good. Any news from the lawyer? The court order against building should give us some time. Shut your eyes and come closer. Shut your eyes. Smell... Without you, all smells have disappeared. I can't stand seeing you looking so sad. I suppose I should be happy when I see you. But all I can think of is that I'll soon say goodbye. Say goodbye now then, so it's done with. I promise... I promise to make up to you for all this. Sometimes I feel I'm going nuts. I'm the same. Kiss me. Get back there! Listen... Go on with your dance rehearsals. We agreed... no goodbyes. That's the basic step. Jump in. I'll give you a lift. Where are you going? The fairground. Know where it is? - You'd never get a taxi now. - No. Do you think you'll go on with your dancing? I saw you at the studio. Really? You didn't answer. I came to see if I could. - And? - I don't know. Have you studied dancing? It's not possible here. What about you? You left one of the world's best troupes.. Why did you come here? The only way for me to return to my country. - Welcome back. - Thanks. So what are you doing with the troupe? Yousef said "traditional steps." - So that's it. - Is that all? What can I do? What do you want? Your experience. Come back to the studio, then we'll see what we can do. Here it is. We'll see. See you! Stay away from the window. There might be more settlers out there. Maybe it would be safer for you to stay with your parents now. Stop the car, Daddy... I want to go back. Are you crazy? They smashed windows and tried to force the door. God only knows what they'll do next. You've no choice. You're living with us. The settlers have weapons. They don't get to kill my daughter. That's just what they want. They want to scare us away. Your mum's right... Stay with us a few days, until things quieten down. Don't force me! I shan't. You do as you wish... ...but tell me just how you feel. What's wrong with you? "As you wish." Whats got into you?! We're going to lose our daughter. I'm fed up! Ahmad! Are you trying to make me have a heart attack?! Go and tell your father you're a good-for-nothing... ...and you deserve a smack! Calm yourself, Umm Habib. Otherwise you'll have a heart attack. He makes my blood boil! Take it easy! I'm sorry. Come on inside. Get my shoe! Quick! Get inside! Damned shoe! Did you know our friend bought the fairground? Kais? Is that true? Would I tell you otherwise? Our friend must be loaded. Hey, handsome! Do you have a light? Handsome! A light... Did settlers really attack your house? Yes, that's what's happening. Is that why you dropped out of rehearsals? Yes, she can't leave her family. How's it going with the troupe? We could do with you. Do you have time for it? I heard you bought the fairground. Didn't buy it. I'm renting it, to fix it up. Blame Umm Habib. She said the kids lacked a playground. She got me to do it. What did I do?! Ahmad! Bring two cups of tea. Don't think this is easy. You've no idea how hard it's been to open here. I've worked like a horse, but thanks to Abu Zaid's family, I've managed. May God bless your husband's family, and bring him home before long. Let's hope for it. Kamar, we're going. It's late. Let her finish her tea. It's alright. 'Bye. Bye bye. See you at rehearsals. I'll be expecting you. So... How come you're not married? I still haven't found Miss Right. So you worked for Zaid's family? For 13 years How long have you known Kamar? Think she's cute? Do you think I'm blind? Stay away from her. Turn off the radio. No bad news thanks. Zaid's coming home... The water's stopped again. Come on, don't get worked up! Is the dough ready? Take some more flour. Not flour, oil. Zaid likes oil. Get the vegetables. Where shall I put them? Here... Put it down there. - One or two cigarettes? - One. There... we'll get lit up! There!... that's for Zaid. Look again. "Zaid Saeed." Read the paper carefully! "Extension of administrative detention." My son's three months are over. We'll go meet him. - "Extension of administrative detention." - Stop calling it that! Say it as it is... imprisonment! Where's your arm? Lift your arm. Once again with both arms. Straight ahead. Fine. Around again. Look straight ahead. Don't think of anything. A bit more relaxed and arms stretched. Do you see his name on the list? Try on Monday. You're going to be just right. We're going to have problems. We need workers. Relax... The pickers will be coming. How will they get through the roadblocks? And there are settlers on our land! Umm Habib knows which one can come. I'll get changed and come with you. I can sort it out myself. You stay here. - Don't be late back. - I won't. Well it's turning in the right direction. I'm trying to do it like I remember. Did you live here? No, but my dad told me how... ...my brother and his pals pretended to fly away on the Ferris wheel. It was a dream... ...another life. Have you come back to find that life? Something along those lines. Where are you going? - To Umm Habib. - I'll come with you. Ahmad, you're to come in now! You could've got yourself killed, for the sake of that ball. I'll take care of him. Get some blankets. ...taking a stand, Israeli police against Palestinians... Israelis, Palestinians... I'm so sick of it all! Come on, Ahmad, you can have a sandwich. What are you doing at the window. Sit down. What do they want with us? I don't know. Kamar... Kamar... - Are you asleep? - No. Want to play a game? What sort of game? Our pastime in Lebanon, when we spent nights in shelters. I say a word and you say the first thing that comes to mind. You begin. Family. Safety. Dreams. Endless sky, filled with clouds. What? You said the first thing that came to mind. For me, nightmares. Why? No particular reason. Your turn. Revolution. Misery. What is it with you? Do you have no hopes ? I live for the moment. I must have something to believe in. That there's another life out there. Whereabouts? Stop fooling around now, and try to sleep. Until those outside get on their way. Don't risk going out. Are they still there? I'll take a look. Keep an eye on Ahmad. Are you still here? What are you doing? Stop pointing that gun at me! Do you have to have a gun to be a man? Speak Arabic, not Hebrew! You're in Ramallah, not Tel Aviv! - What are you doing here? - What am I doing here? This is Umm Habib's Cafe. No war. Understood? Get away from here, now! Put the gun away. Get yourself inside, OK? - Are you listening?! - I said "put the gun away"! Put it away! You've already cost me a day's business! Shut up! I said "speak Arabic"! Understood? What's the world coming to, with kids telling us what to do. We'll try something else. Once more... Turn around... Close your eyes and fall back. Seriously? I'm joking. Turn around. Relax your whole body. What's wrong? Without this, you can't progress with the dance steps. You'll have problems. Don't be scared. Close your eyes. Don't think of anything. Relax your body.. Excellent. How does it feel? One more time? Fall back now... ...totally relaxed. Off you go! - Finished? - Just about. Come on, hurry it up! Look at me. Look at me. I understand. Don't tell Umm Zaid anything about this. Yes, I understand that she won't be able to handle that Zaid's hearing's been delayed. Okay, you too. Goodbye. Do you want to dance? Doesn't seem so. Let go! I'll show you. Something's holding you back. Do you want to, or not? - I want to! - Show me! Yes, you'll see! You're early. Where have you been? What are you doing here? I've been waiting 2 hours. Umm Zaid phoned. She doesn't like you're out late every other night. Where have you been? At dance lessons. Why are you so late? I'm not doing anything wrong. Zaid's not going to like this. Your mum couldn't get permission. Maybe it's just as well. I've been dreadfully worried. The fighting wasn't near us. And they only go after people on their wanted list. Everyone's fine. The lawyer said for you to admit you hit a soldier, and you'll be released. Look, Zaid... at what's become of you. Think about us. Think about the land. I'm not admitting anything. It's no big deal! If you don't, they'll keep you in here longer. You must understand, please! I do, but what's the point? Just let's save what we can out of it. We'd probably win, with an Israeli lawyer. When did anyone win such a case? There's no justice here. I'm not signing any admission. If you signed it, you'd probably get out... ...and you can defend your land. You can't imagine how much I want to get out. Do you know how much I worry? I worry about you... ...about Mum. I die a thousand deaths every day. I know we've not much chance of winning the case. But to be remembered for having signed an Israeli confession... That's not a memory that neither you or I or our children will have. If this is all too hard for you... ...don't bother coming back. Hi, Yousef. Good to see you. We've missed you. Where is everyone? They asked to come in later today. Why? They just asked. That's just not allowed. The start time has been 4 o'clock for years. You can't change it without asking me. - But you weren't here. - You still can't change it! And what is this for a poster? Who authorised such a poster? What has this got to do with dance? I brought you here! I make the decisions here! But Yousef... Don't bother me! What's happened here? It's all Yousef's doing. "Because of the situation, dance classes are canceled." I don't understand. What'll we do about the performance? I'll be opening the fairground in 2 weeks. We can have the performance there. Just a moment... I'm on my way. What was that? Zaid's been let out. I have to go. I don't know what I'll be doing. We can discuss the performance later. Wait... wait a minute...! I must go now! I'll give you a lift. - Are you sure? - Of course. I've waited so long for this moment. It's lovely to have you back. Welcome home. Higher up. Higher. Higher up, so people can see. How shall I pin it? He who just lost, will help you. Yes, you're the winner, so you decide. Come to dance performance "Pomegranate and Myrrh" - What does a ticket cost? - It's free. Free! Very well... I'll take them to the dance. You have to take care of yourself. I've waited 22 years to come here. My brother Ghassan promised to take me... to the only Ferris wheel in Beirut. I was 10 in 1982... but I can still hear the screaming... ...like the sound of the sea. Heart-rending screams... I stood behind the door... and waited for Ghassan to come home. There was a lot of smoke... and when it cleared... ...I saw Mum lying on the road outside the house. I crept out to her... and lay down beside her. I asked why Ghassan was late. I lay beside Mum for 3 days and neither ate nor drank. She never said why Ghassan was late. I've lost everything. I don't want to lose you. Don't make it harder for me. You can't give me hope... and then go back without a word. What do you want me to say? That I longed to see you at dance class. Yes, that's what I want to hear. So now you know. If you feel any sort of duty towards Zaid just because he's been in prison... ...remember you only live once. Why not live the way you want to? I don't feel any sense of duty. And me...? Was I just a bit on the side? Keeping you entertained till Zaid was released? Or...? No, I'd never say that. What is it then? Tell me. Tell me. I'm listening. What do I mean to you? On your way! Just go! Hullo everybody! All ready? Time to start. We'll take a minute's silence for all our martyrs. To Palestine! Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
