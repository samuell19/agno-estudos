Beware giant, I am the knight errant and I will beat you. Fighting over. I'll get it. Beware my sword. What do you say? Test the steel of my sword. Touch. Finally hit. I hear you groan? Get on your knees and beg for mercy. Alonso, you must go to bed. Lord of Timonel Carcachona... The Prince of Biscay. Rachmaninoff, Nietzsche. The Duke of Quiraccia. As shield three crowns on a field azure. Great deeds of the knights-errant. Here, here. Miaulina, daughter of Espartifalardo 't Bos. With a cat in his shield and motto his daughters name. Uncle Alonso, you read too much and eat too little. The noble struggle of Sir Galahad. Damsels in distress. What do you say? Test the steel of my sword. Touch. Finally hit. Don Alonso, I thought you were my wife . They always put me to work. Sancho Panza dreamed you used not another life? From adventures? Your father left me before work as hard as my wife now. There is' n time you for all your efforts will be rewarded. I only get now and then some wine and 's a lot of grumbling from Teresa. Your life will change. And my life too. Yes. We are not getting any younger. What would you say... A big trip to make? The market in La Mancha? That's quite far enough. - My dear Sancho. Buurman Panza, you've probably never realized you... But the world is bigger than La Mancha. I'm talking about the outside world, neighbor. And in that world we can both be famous. Sancho, you're still not chopped wood? I visit. We 't there are still about. Careful on my whistle. Uilskuikens, suckers. My true name and title. Use my real name and title. I am no longer Alonso Quixada. That ignoble name I wear any more. From now on I through life as a knight. I called Don Quixote of La Mancha. And I will make a name as the Gaula Amadis... ... And Sir Lancelot. Do sit down. You need not be so important to do. Don Quixote to be as good as Señor Alonso shaved. His beard grows just as hard. - Important? Words must be weighty. Like thoughts and ambitions. But it weightier is the lady that I adore. I'm talking about before. A glorious time. Is everyone just forget that time? A time when the knight by the land wandered and did good deeds. He freed the oppressed, defeated tyrants without out to gain. I, Don Quixote of La Mancha, will then revive. Those beautiful, beautiful time full glory. A time that we know from the books. - Dear Uncle... Let you still enjoy shaving. - For the mayor is so. Is there nothing else in this life? The mayor is and Sundays we go to church. Once in two days I get shaved. Where is the honor? Where is the virtue? Where's the glorious adventure? Maybe, Don... Thurs... - Quixote. Perhaps those days behind you. - Never. Never. I will have lots of experience. Wait and see. What do we wait? Never mind. Shave me. Do I look good. It's almost time. Mealtime? No sir the barber. It's time to travel. What's he doing? What's he doing right? You'll also get my new name. A title. From now on you the steed of the knight errant. You are no longer an insignificant beast. Days and many nights I've been thinking about a name. A prominent and well-sounding name. And now I greet you with this name, my Rosinante. What was that? - What? There someone whistled. - An owl? No, it was not an owl. Who's there? Mother, stop it. There is none. There is someone. I heard him whistle. Okay, I'll go look. What do you say? I said I just go outside. What are you doing? - I go for some fresh air... And the search for peace. How long will you leave? - As long as I feel like it. Well? If my squire. You can help me if we beat giants and save innocents. What an honor for 'n simple villager... Someone who is both poor as simple-minded. Honor? And how does that honor me? Many knights know during their expeditions to conquer an island. A whole island? - Sometimes called two. And often gets the squire... - A portion of honor? No, the title of governor. You're not serious. - Thus' t written. As governor you can be rich. Certainly. And I have four pieces of land sold and mortgaged. So we are well equipped. Plus, you get a new shirt of mine. Where is that island anyway? Somewhere in the seven seas. There lies the island so. I do not like walking. Can I bring my ass? I've never had a squire heard on a donkey. I'll be the first. That would be something positive. You coming? You are the squire of Don Quixote of La Mancha. If I get one island. Beautiful Dulcinea, you're the woman that I adore with all my being. That's very nice of you, but I called Aldonza. From now on your name differently. You are my beloved Dulcinea. A knight without love is like a tree without leaves... An egg without salt, a body without soul. Am I your favorite? - You will not see me four years. What do I get it? - I will fight with giants. And anyone who denies that my Dulcinea the most beautiful. You do not have to fight for me, señor Quixada. I now called Don Quixote of La Mancha. And a true knight goes for his beloved by the fire. Fine, but we go to El Toboso move. My dad goes there images clean. Does not matter, you will always my beloved. And I call you... Dulcinea del Toboso. Pick up the ladder. The day greeted us... Mother sleeps in the kitchen. The big adventure begins. - Really? I will notify Dapple. The master is gone. - Departed? He has gone mad. - My uncle is gone. Disappeared. He spoke of an adventure. - He is unworldly. What? - He will find no heroes or giants. People will'm not understand. - Do you? Not really. Lady Luck smiles to the brave. - Me otherwise. Unfriendly people. - Look. Our adventure starts well. What do you mean? - Colossal giants. At least thirty. And I will rob them of their lives. The killing of that brood is a worthy and noble task. Their cries does not bother me, I am within my rights. Their swords and clubs Deren me either. Today we a great victory. Yet? For me there is only one objection. What? - It's just a small price to pay. Say on, then. - I do not see any giants. Simple soul. What do you know about adventure? Do you see them wave their arms? Some arms up long. But I will beat them. These are not poor, but the blades of windmills. Innocent tools for grinding grain. Nothing no innocent instruments. Ga aside and pray for me as you're too scared. Listen giants it is an uphill battle... But I fight for God and for my beloved Dulcinea del Toboso. You can do it, but 's are just windmills. Looks like the giant won. It was the accursed magician and necromancer, Malfatto. He changed the giants into windmills for me to beat. You are now covered in bruises. This bruising extend me credit. Help me up, Sancho. Honor, huh? I knew that was associated with bruises. One thing still bothers me about. - The bruises on your butt? No, I do not care. I'm still not knighted. You have knighted yourself yet? You're not too smart. - That is correct. You can not dub yourself. - Oh, no? Otherwise you can knight yourself as Don Sancho of the Willing Ass. Dapple might find 't is an honor... But I thank you for it. Why? - Knight are too dangerous to me. Who will be your knight? - Some lord or the king. No idea where he is. Lady luck smiles at us still increasing. Someone who owns a castle, can I do to knight. Then I can liberate the oppressed and boasting about Dulcinea. Do you see a castle? - Do not you? You say it. You're the boss. Now hear 'n dwarf my arrival to report with trumpets. They had no fixed dwarf. There you 't have. The castle you hear that I am welcome. And at the gate are two maidens to greet us. The ball. I beg you ladies, fear not. Because I will never hurt a woman. And certainly no virgins of your position. Virgins. He called us virgins? Thus we do not often more appealed. All our beds are occupied, but if you want to dismount... I have 'n meal and show a sleeping place for you. The lord was extremely hospitable. Is it a lord? I thought it was an innkeeper. Mr. lord... - What a strange title. I do not care about comfort, I lay me often rested on the battlefield. I do not, I want a nice straw mattress. I just want, after I'm gone wait... Go ahead. You as lord would be so kind to me... You get me fried eggs, bread and fine 'n beer mug. I ask you in all humility whether you want to save me a knight. Right. Oh yes, you can also still on. And I count for nothing. Is your master someone who cleans equipment? Of course not. He is a famous knight errant. Why he keeps watch. What is a knight errant? I will tell you. It's most sad, bruised and tormented creature there is. But soon he owns several islands to give his squire. Lady Dulcinea, help me to prove my courage. Gird, best knight. God and your lady. I give you my heart and my handkerchief. The one who still comes to my harness, offends my Dulcinea... And must die. Villains, I am blinded. You have seduced me? Villains. I get you guys. Treacherous villains... You misbehave you, I pull you to my lance. Stop. Stop immediately. Wait and watch how this man knighted lettuce. But Mr. Castel Liano, my dear lord... My wait is not over yet. - That's otherwise have been nice. Come. Put your knee against my foot. I read from 't book of the holy order of knights-errant. Do you swear, Don Quixote of La Mancha... At the holy order of knights... Order to fight evil, innocent to help... And this country to liberate of despicable, marauding giants? I swear. And you swear to protect the honor of your beloved, the beautiful... Dulcinea. - Yes, quite. And for those who deny its beauty to fight? With all my heart. - Give me his sword. Rise... Mr. Knight. That island will soon be mine. Money? Are you mad, Mr. Castel Liano? You ask me for ordinary coins? - For shelter, horse feed... And 'n lamstoofschotel for your servant. - Lamstoofschotel? Ask the lord money for his guests' n stew? And your hospitality then? - Forget about it. In this castle, I knighted beaten. This inn has your horse three bales of straw eaten. It's changed. - No, you know. You are transformed into innkeeper. - Nonsense. I will prove it to you. A landlord can not had me knight. I want you to pay. - Poor man. But fear not. I will find magician who has bewitched you. And if it happens, he will its lusts. Come back, you. You still need to pay. You there. Payments. - I thought it was a castle. Liar. I also thought that the stew was free. Payments. Do not. - Why? Are you bewitched? No money. - Then we will. Come on, guys. Hup Dapple, far. Hey. Hurry up. This castle was bewitched. You were attacked by goblins. They knew me about 'n wall to throw. Because they possessed magical powers. Is that so? - Too bad I could not help. This had not yet enjoyed. Like a knight I ever attacking another, do not help me. No problem. You may only 't mob fight, not knights. Is it okay if I do not fighting with the mob? Where are we now? Prepare yourself, Sancho. Prepare for the adventure. Hey No, not again. Handsome girl, huh? Wonderful. But not as beautiful as Dulcinea. The counselors out there crazy. - Tutors? Leek's good. It's not a mob? - Magicians. Servants of the dark prince Malfatto. They have kidnapped the beautiful Angelica. I think 't other monks. Shut up, you know nothing of magicians off. Rosinante Come, let's go save her. Bunch cursed demons. Let the captive princess Fri. Or get ready for a fight with Don Quixote of La Mancha... Protector of the innocent. How he called us? - Demons. We are monks. - Yes, we are Benedictine monks. You can not fool me. In 'n habit, the devil a devil. Your eyes have betrayed you. He has a monk assassinated. Am I in heaven? Are you an angel? - Undetermined. Come. Princess, you are now free to come and go as you please. I'm a married woman. A doctor's wife, that is. On the way to my husband in Seville. - Exactly, yes. A princess who travels incognito. Your attackers fled. SUMMER? - Magicians. I saw their insect eyes. - Monks. I had confessed to them. Do they have two confessors need? - Who are you? Your servant, Don Quixote of La Mancha. And I expect no reward. - I need to be my husband. Pedro. You are free, princess. You can go wherever you want. Hey, hey, finally rest. We are the army of Alifanfaron yet to come. Come, let us first eat quietly without adventures. There is no time to eat. - Sure it does. I have some cheese. And a onion. It is no food for 'n noble knight... Have you read anything about us? I almost never read. But I the stories told often enough. I listened Maybe not always. - A knight eat once a month. Glad I'm mob. - Then he eats of 'n lavish banquet. Better than cheese and onion. Also they live on flowers and berries. Too good. I will my bags with flowers and berries fill. Excellent. But I personally could eat. Tasty pork trotters... Fried drumsticks. Look, Sancho. What did I tell you. Getting closer. There is a great army. Where? Do you hear the soldiers sing? Are you sure 't soldiers? - It is an army of many nations. But there must be two armies. Why? - I see another cloud. What a happy day. A historic moment. Two generals wage war. - Let them. Alifanfaron, emperor of the island Tropobana... And Pentapolin with Pulled Mouw, who fight with bare arm. Can they do not? Do you know anything? - Not much. Alifanfaron Pentapolins daughter is in love. He wants 'r abduct to his encampment. So there's a woman in the game. - Look... Laurealcu that is, Lord of the Silver Bridge. And with the flowers on his harness the Duke of Quiraccia. And the mighty Brandabarbaron. If he has shield 'n port. One that Samson has pulled out of the temple. Why gape at me like that? Sorry sir, but I can only hear the bleating of two flocks of sheep. That is fear. - So scary, I think not. Fear of the armies has affected your eyes and ears. Hide you, Sancho. If you're so afraid... I'll make sure my favorite army is victorious. For what you herd? Alifanfaron attacks. Retire, tyrant. Here is Don Quixote of La Mancha. Does that name also shake your heart? Master, come back. You only covers some lamb bolts. Lady Dulcinea. Cheer, knights fight for King Pentapolin. Follow me. I will take vengeance on those vrouwenontvoerder. Great Alifanfaron, Don Quixote challenges you to a fight. A fatal duel. Or are you hiding in your tent? Pulling you back? Let your sword. You hit like a flock of sheep on the run. A wise decision. We won. I fought for the honor of lady Dulcinea del Toboso. Rest assured. The danger has passed, we won. Hurrah. I Can 't to say this, master? A bird in the hand than ten in the air. Fine words make the carbon is not fat. All talk. - Sancho, what do you say now? Okay, I'll be honest. How much money will I get? - Who is talking about money? My wife Teresa later. - What? My wife will want to know what my weekly wage. Then your wife knows the rules 't no knighthood. True, she is a very silly woman. I know no knight or squire... Sunk so deep that he likes to be rewarded. I do not mind sinking so deep, you know. You get your reward if we succeed... Our price to win. Are you sure? - I trust in God and my beloved. But they give me my wages? - Listen... You will soon get 'n island. - Can not I advance? I am not a lender. I am the Knight of La Mancha. What should I say to Teresa? Look there. Lui those enslaved by Malfatto. No, that his convicts. Convicted? Prisoners, naughty boys, villains, chain gangs. You're a simple soul and quick to deceive. But we will 't know soon enough. You, with your strange cup of tea. Ga on the side. Strange cup of tea? This is it armor of a Spanish knight. Know that you are talking to Don Quixote of La Mancha have. Tell me, who are these poor devils? Poor bastards? They are convicts. Forced? Scandalous. They do not work in free will? Voluntary chain gangs? - I must do my job: Violence and oppression negate and help the unfortunate. They have committed crimes. What crimes? - Ask it, but they. What have you done? - I fell in love. Can anyway. - He so loved golden candlesticks... That he took them and was arrested for theft. And what was your crime? I sang like a canary. But that's nothing? He means that he twenty robberies has confessed. And your crime, black beard? I loved my sisters too. Family Life brings joy. So much that he was father. And why are you here? - I brought lovers together. He was a pimp and brothel owner. For such an appeal, you are clever and wise... ... Because you get to hear many secrets. And you? This is the worst villain of all. He has 'a book written about it.' Ginisello He called the Monte Passa. Either Gines. You have described your life? - A portion. I'm not dead yet. - He hopes even more to eat. You seem to me a witty guy. - But I have no luck. Fortuna That bitch does not like witty people. So if you want to help us, shoot a bit. I do not want to stand here and bake answer your questions. Best. Dear friends and brothers... You have any crimes and is punished. But you are forced and suppressed. And in my capacity as a knight... I ask your captain to you to liberate your yoke. Guards, freed these men. Ridiculous. No, that is merciful. It's been nice. On the side. - Forward march. No way. You see gentlemen, I have freed you from oppression... And you want me now fixed reward. But I do not need to be rewarded. - Good. Well I want you for your own sake and that of my beloved... Toward Toboso goes... And there your chains lady Dulcinea gives, as a sign of regret. Tell how this knight has freed you and then enjoy your freedom. That's not unreasonable? - Yes. You mean 'yes, we do'? - I mean, 't is unreasonable. But I recommend it. - Pardon? While we must hide, must sneak through alleys... And into the forest to sleep... Do you want us together... Chain and all to 'n weight in a different town or go? Wicht? Do you call the beautiful Dulcinea a balance? You heard me. - Yes... And God help me, eggplants or Ginisello or whoever you might be. You're on your knees to Toboso... With all these chains on your shoulders and there you'll you regret. Bye, sir. Knight of the Sorrowful Face. Listen, do good to vipers is carrying coals to Newcastle. Let's go before they come back. - I pull me back out of fear. Well I do. Come on. Trust me, they have no respect for knights errant. Are you afraid? - Terrified. Would you that I withdraw? - If the heartbeat. Under one condition. - Say. Tell anyone that I've retired. I remain silent as the grave. I do not want it later on written. I give you my word. Come. On our trip we will determine still meet a nice king. This is better than a bunch of crooks, thugs and thieves. He will of course recognize me. - Sure, of course. And he'll treat me to a banquet. - A banquet, which seems to me. A banquet for knights, squires but are not forgotten. As long as I get something to eat. Then I see a woman with furtive glances at me. Steal them? Quite a greedy lady, huh? No, she has lost her heart to me. We have only one night, because I have to fight for the king. Are you sure this story ends well? I climb to her window. - From who? My beautiful Dulcinea. - Is she the daughter of the king? Course. - I had it to know. Or maybe we are experiencing 'n that adventure even more exciting. Even more exciting? - Maybe. Yes, I will do my oath. - What oath? I will Mambrino's golden helmet return. Mambrino. Are we already encountered? - Yet. Do you Mambrino? Not personally, no. A brave Saracen, a noble Moor. When this warrior slept, stole Rinaldo the Bald his helmet. Had he'm definitely needed. If you're bald, can you 'n helmet use. Silence. You're talking nonsense. It is certainly nonsense. God in heaven be thanked. He sends adventures in my path. Do you see it, too? What? - It shines in all its glory... The golden helmet of Mambrino. - That's a dentist scale. There goes a knight on his steed. A lame mule. I get that rogue Rinaldo did. His bald head is covered with stolen gold. Help me's a hand. - Sure. Look at this. I will raise him on my own to tackle. - Yes, that seems the best. Stop, traitor. Stand still. Give me the golden helmet of Mambrino. Did you 'to me? - Halt, you bald. Stand still and fight. - I'm not bald. The golden helmet of Mambrino. Come. Beware, Gines. Careful. Come. Relax. Good. All right. Come. I imagine my life serving you. From now on I live only for you and for your smile. My knight, out of gratitude and love I would suggest you should kneel. Who will I kill? What demon, tyrant, giant or wizard... Wants to rob you of your beauty? You do no murder. This is a night full of love. Kiss me. Allow me to add? - I beg you. I believe I still know how it should. - Show. Prima. You are both 'n great warrior like a great lover. Stay with me, Don Quixote. Stay forever. I promised your father something. - Continue? Ga for I'm fighting. - This is dangerous. I lead 'n dangerous life. - Soon you killed. In an honorable war. - I would not not be tolerated. Beautiful lady. My Dulcinea. My goddess, say something. Dapple's gone. He was stolen. My dear donkey. My best friend. The chain gangs have done this. Disturb me in my sweet dreams? - My heart is broken. What is it? Are you in love? My dear donkey. He's stolen tonight. Those thieves who helped you. You can show other donkey of my cousin get. But first I have pen, ink and paper. I gotta be important letter. Dulcinea, you was so good to me in my dreams to visit. But the love with which you greeted me... Is just the beginning of our happiness. This is a letter from your lover, Don Quixote of La Mancha. Give this letter to lady Dulcinea. We will meet again in Toboso. Where, you say? - Toboso, deaf. Wait for me... - La Botta. A fine inn. Never's castle. Until we meet again... Dear Sancho. Please, go quickly to the palace of the most beautiful. My poor master, he is so battered. The Knight of the Sorrowful Face. - I refer to him as well. We have him guard. - For beating. For some bad with 'm done. - He still fantasizes? And he's got more about his beloved. She's probably also just a dream. - Do you know Dulcinea del Toboso? He has written her a letter. Another fantasy. The letter was delivered. If we could find m. - I know where he is. Then we could'm persuaded... Where? - In the inn on the road to Toboso. You should go there and persuaded him. Well, he did not listen. He is sure he 'n errant knight. So he calls himself. To whom would he listen? - Not to us. Only to his beloved. Beautiful Dulcinea. I think. He listens to every beautiful woman. Every beautiful woman. Great grace. I have an idea. Daddy, leek's who it is. I knew it. You are wiser than us. Your beloved may be rich and handsome... But he has not fixed the magical powers that I possess. This love potion has... ...of my mom 'n Egyptian magician purchased. Drink up, my beauty... And find charms in me that does not woman in the world can withstand. Let her go, cowardly wizard. I'm not afraid of your magic. I am Don Quixote...

What an acting art. You were great. Thank you. Here is your share. The audience thought it was great. Money? Would you insult me? I do not want money. I save no ladies to be rewarded. A wandering knight does not care about money. And listen carefully. You should treat your wife better, else I will come back. Goodbye, friends. Do you want some fruit, children? Let's see. I'm sorry. I have no fruit. How about money? Here. Take it. I can not use it. Will they help us? - Yes. I cut them. These actors are what I owe. Where are they? - In the inn on the road to Toboso. Very nice. No man will be able to resist. It is inappropriate. The church is' t not. A female priest is not allowed, so this not. You gotta but to trick them. I shave my beard off. It's my trademark as a barber. Then cover your face but. From modesty. Is not it dangerous to a beautiful woman to be? What if I... Get raped? - What is important? Our master save or your virginity? I do not know. Welcome inn La Botta, master. Hello, Sancho. I've missed you crazy enough. Dear landlady... Don Quixote of La Mancha. The inn is full, but you may best sleep in the basement. I am a knight errant against tyrants and giants fighting. I have during my trips often enough slept in uncomfortable places. Then the basement no objection. Madam, I would be happy to answer your furtive glances... But my heart belongs to the beautiful Dulcinea of Toboso. Very nicely said. Are you not the great knight errant, Don Quixote of La Mancha? That is correct. - Oh, lord... I need help. Would someone as famous as you want to help me? Silence, sister. She is so upset that she gibberish deflection. A damsel in distress? Tonight, talked about a vision Malfatto. I am dead scared. - Malfatto is my nemesis. Themselves not to give him, she will be slain by giants. Yes, he wanted me to indulge his appetites . Then I will with my arms and courage protect. I'm very grateful. Do you... Now nothing more to say. Who knows who's listening. Where do you sleep tonight? - In the basement. What terrible. - Something not hurt a great warrior. After midnight, my sister came to visit you in the basement. Who's there? Maiden. - Save me. What should I do? - The giants will kill me. Are the giants here? They are everywhere around us. - Come out, cruel earth. Madam, you are bewitched. Alas poor, they have given you a beard. Where are they? I kill them. Rogue, thief, womanizer. Stand still, and fight. Draw your sword, sample. Come on. Blood. Blood, giant. You women's beard gives. I am the magician and necromancer , Malfatto. I have you in my power, Don Quixote. Let your sword. - I never give me, you devil. Make my hands. Toe. Untie me, remove the cloth from my eyes. Where are you taking me? I see nothing. He's asleep. - Yesterday again he wanted adventure. Are there giants to kill? - The fever 'm yet to tackle. He has it still on Lancelot and Amadis. His head is still filled with that nonsense. - It's the books. Myths and stories about battles and quests poisoned his mind. He loves his books. - So is it important to remove them. That is so. - With God's help... We 'to save these books. Let's get the worst books strip out. Mirror 't knighthood. His finest book. Hold? - From a human vanity mirrors. Get rid of it. Lord Bernardo with the Golden Beard. - Golden beard? Are there barbers for? - I think not. Get rid of it. The twelve knights of Syracuse. In 't Italian. Italian? Pity 't is not in Spanish. Do not throw it away. All twelve. I think you doin 'a lot faster if we do not read all the titles. Madam. Housekeeper. Antonia. I am bewitched. What is it? - Where is the door, I ask you? Where are you? Door? Which door? - Die to the library. Pardon? - There is only 'n white wall. The lot is enchanted. Where is my library? - Did you have a library? I know of nothing. Here are evil spirits behind me who want to prevent the fight. Here is Malfatto behind. That me like a caged lion sent home. The lion is free again. Free and furious. The time of reading is over. It is now time for adventure. The caged lion is free again. We are afraid that he goes back on the road. We need advice from someone wiser than me. What is this? Come. Note his hand. Cousin... Samson. We need your help. - Should I fight, or thinking? You must help us with 'n poor man that' s past lives. Samson Carrasco. Student literature at the University of Salamanca. Can we say student? - Yes. Someone lot of history and knows the age of chivalry. Am I right or not? - Yes. And this man will 'n clever argument and much persuasion... Poor Don Quixote try to heal. Will that work, do you think? - I think it's succeeds. Free of all his thoughts knight fantasies. Tell him that the days of knights over. He lives in the past. All those stories about knights and damsels in distress. It is pure nonsense. What the holy knights added. What an impertinence. And a hellion still wet behind the ears. How dare you turn my beloved Knights blacken? I have sworn to protect all women with my sword. Your sword, uncle? Stop it anyway's about it. Your sword is already old and rusty. You are not heroic, you're old. My mind is still young. Unfortunately. Why would an old man if you can improve the world? Because I still have dreams. Keep on dreaming. Come out and join us in the sun. Then I bring you figs and soft bread. - Figs? No, Don Quixote of La Mancha. I beg you... Do not accept figs and soft bread. You are widely known and should off again. U, successor of Palmeira of England and the Gaula Amadis... Are required your quest for justice continue. What did you say? - I beg you to fight. You're not old. You are young at heart. I, Samson Carrasco... Student literature and expert in the field of chivalry... Beg you to keep fighting. Did you hear that, niece? What a wise young man. Well, student letters, what do you want me to do now? Jump back on travel. Even though here are some cheeky little who doubt me? Thanks, student literature. I will challenge you. My poor uncle. - Are you crazy? What have you done? In this way he will find healing. By to cram his head with delusions? His head was full anyway delusions. Let him just as much adventures and disaster experience... Until he is seriously ill and permanently cured. Is not that a smart approach? The approach of a literate? - Exactly, yes. I will soon find it. Even if I so self back in time to. So you go to him again? To Governor's Island to be. - Governor? All governors can go to hell. It will bring me much. - Listen... You are not born as governor... You've never been governor... And when you die, you will not governor. Do I therefore less of you? If I did Governor's Island would be... Would you also get a title. - Ga anyway. I am a simple woman born. I do not want a title so everyone says: Look at those upstart trien programs. Sometimes you are so stupid as 's rear end of a pig. Lady Dulcinea. Have you given her my letter? Yeah, right. - Where was she? In the castle at the balls with her ladies in waiting? No, she was knocking on the mats. It's impossible. - Where it seemed to otherwise have to. And Sancho, you have the air of her sweet perfume smell? She smelled of sweat 't beat mats. How she reacted to my letter? That put them in her apron. I think she can not read. Malfatto has affected your memory. It's okay. We will my Dulcinea in Toboso found here as well. You have visited her in d'r castle? - Sure. A large and imposing building? - Yes. This must be it. The most imposing building in Toboso. That will do, but this is a... What is this? A castle. Right. Go and ask the lady Dulcinea messenger or her loyal knight wants to receive. Whether they want to receive her knight. Will she receive me? - Unfortunately I have bad news. She's not sick, I hope? - No, she's not sick... But she is traveling. Going? Where to? - According to the messenger... To 'west. Good Sancho, then we go the west. Looking for beauty. Come, Dapple. I hear her al. I hear Dulcinea and her ladies laugh. Are you sure? - Yes, how could I be mistaken? Toe. Say 'r that Don Quixote of La Mancha wants to make his appearance. Why do you hesitate? - I do not know. Come. Do not get blinded by her beauty. Who are you looking really, Sancho? Someone who does not exist. Except in the vivid imagination of my master. I must find her. Previously, he is no rest. But why? Because my teacher thinks that I have given her a letter. But if it does not exist, makes t did not matter who you find? This is not from beet. Have not found her? - Why? Are you blind? Look. What a spectacle. I see nothing. - Nothing? Only three giggling peasant girls on mangy donkeys. Are you drunk? Do you see that beautiful white thoroughbreds for donkeys? Do you see the beautiful Dulcinea and her ladies or not? Are you blind, sir? I do not think so. Ga than at homage to your beloved. Uwe haughtiness, mercy on this poor knight... Don Quixote with the Sorrowful Face. Look. He is completely petrified at the sight of your beauty. You must kneel. Please, your gravity... Declare him your love. - Ga it's on the side. Let my ass off. - We are in a hurry. You love us for fools. - What? No, beautiful princess of Toboso. This is deeply tragic. Breaks your heart does not now your knight so here for you at the knees like? It is a fool with smooth talk. He takes us into the grind. - Letting Go, you. Running, Dunghill. Come on. - Do not they look gorgeous? With their beautiful, soft robes and their beautiful white horses. I see only peasant girls. What do I do? Am I crazy, insane? Really? Do you know what happened to you? The big Malfatto you again 's bewitched. I've finally found your beloved. And it was not easy. But you see her. Just another diabolical region. But I get him though. Good. Instance, I know you again. How do I undo this spell? Halt. I am the Knight of the Mirrors. And my adored, the incomparable Casilia the Vondalia... Is the most beautiful woman there. - You're lying. Dulcinea del Toboso is the fairest. I challenge you. My lady is as beautiful as Venus. - Venus falls in 't not Dulcinea. Give that, or go 't fight. - With you? Are you that knight his squire? - Yes, unfortunately. I sat at home fishing. - Yeah, me too. But I'm waiting on my island. I would not sit and jump. Why not? - It puts a lot of costs involved. No, that's nonsense. I will defeat you in 'n duel. - Know what you are saying. I have 'n the biggest single combat knight errant of all reports. And who is that? The famous and valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha. So now I'm the Wandering Knight of the Universe. You lie, Knight of the Mirrors. You lie you crack. Do you call me 'a liar? - Have you fought with Don Quixote? Absolutely, I swear on the heavenly throne. On the heavenly throne. What did it look like? He's a tall man with a pale, emaciated face. He has gray hair and 'n pointed nose. His squire called Sancho Panza. A farm laborer and not too smart. He is talking about me. - Listen and weep. I am Don Quixote of La Mancha. And I challenge you. I accept your challenge under one condition. What? - The winner of the slain... Everywhere steer where he wants. Good. I accept your condition. Ecuyer. My lance. Master, help me in that tree. Flight you for 't fight? - No, for his nose. What a whopper. Step it. Come on. Toe. Go on. Hort goatee. Come on. Go on. Okay? - He survives t, however. Happy. After a victory, we knights always very generous. The squire with his enormous gamble... Wore's false nose. We have a few minor inconveniences ago. Small? - But now we can enjoy. After my victory just I am the greatest knight who is there. But you know, that squire... I'm sure that our barber was. What would that mean? - No idea. It is also not clear to me. Hey, Blanca. Blanca, where are you now? Give me back my lamb. Where is Blanca? Bandits have stolen my lamb. What did he? He's a lamb lost in that cave. That's why he always calls. Why you doin 'm not save? Because he is afraid. There are bandits in that cave. Montesinos' cave. The king's heart Durandarte to Belerma gave. Would they have nothing else to eat? It was a proof of eternal fidelity. But understand that you do not. There is much written about this cave. I would like to show a look. What? Down there? - This is the entrance. Are not you afraid? Knight of the Mirrors has defeated knows no fear. It's been five fathoms fallen. He burns his feet still in 't hellfire. My master is in 't rope slipped. - Your Master and my lamb. We both are lost. Poor, mad master. Don Quixote, knight of La Mancha. The whole world knows him because of his fight for justice. That's very nice, but... - We who live in seclusion... Have been waiting for your arrival to my castle. Do you king Montesinos? - That's my name, yes. This' heart of his dying friend uitsneed? It took a dagger... - It was not a dagger... But a stylet, as sharp as a tiger tooth. Come on. There lies my friend Durandarte. It looks so real. He is not of marble, but of flesh and bones. He is enchanted by the magician Merlin and devilish son. He will forever rest but says now and then some. My heart. I have given your heart to her, my friend. I will soon show you. Belerma Is this lady? Yes, the most beautiful woman in the world. False. No way. Disappear. I 't need to know. You worship lady Dulcinea del Toboso. The most beautiful. - Yes, and she survives. She survives, but is enchanted. - Bewitched? When I saw her, she was a peasant girl and not at all pretty. Is it possible? - But in a world full of magic. Here women in various guises: Queen Guinevere and her hofschenker. Cleopatra and Lady... And? Listen. Two crowns Can I borrow from you? What I'm currently strapped for cash. You do receive my underskirt as collateral. Is this possible? Women of nobility sit tight? She says. Lady Dulcinea... I will fight for you and bleed, I would even die for you... But... money? Two crowns. No need for me to die. Our love is not earthly, but spiritual and harmonious. Give me two crowns if you want harmony. Well, if you need it. Poverty is everywhere, both nobles as bewitched. Give me the money, in the interest of our love. My Dulcinea. Goddess. I bite. He hangs back on the rope. My lamb. So that's happening? - As surely as I sit here. You 't dream it? - No. Do not you a little... Insane? Sometimes I sound insane? Not at all. I must admit. And you have the lamb found... In the cave of Montesinos. And I'm included. - That is true. I've seen it myself. But all those events in the cave... I do not understand. But that does not mean that it is impossible. True. That is absolutely true. But you must admit... Happen in this world many strange and incredible things. Yes, weird... But beautiful. He calls himself Don Quixote of La Mancha. He's totally crazy, because he jumped on stage... To save the actress. And then began to swing his sword. Very comical all. He wears 'n rusty, old helmet. And his squire is thick and stupid, called Sancho and riding on a donkey. A donkey on a donkey, so. When we him saw, he just kept a tournament with another knight. He lives entirely in the past. - Great. The thick squire was so scared that he climbed a tree. Where are they now? They come slowly this way. Looking for even more disaster. We will do our programs with those two entertained. Yes, fun. The embroidery begins to bore me. Fine Lady, I'm the humble squire of the man... Which the Knight of the Mirrors defeated: Don Quixote. The Knight of the Sorrowful Face? Do you know my master? - He enjoys great fame. Everyone is talking about him. - Really? What do they say? He kills giants and a squire, Sancho called. An illiterate and stupid man. - I am. Do they 't about me too? - Up in the highest circles. I will not be long squire. Because I get an island. - And you also probably deserved. He who the Knight of the Mirrors reports, greeting you. If I can do something, how dangerous, then... Do you have to do's look. This is the knight everyone is talking about. Don Quixote, this is my husband, the Duke of Boratorio. Look at to, the famous knight. Welcome to my humble estate. Nothing detracts my meeting with your wife. Thank you. Come along to my primitive hunting lodge? Am I invited? - What would we do without you? Good. Here we go. I thought he fought with windmills, but he said it were giants. And who knows? Tasty, but put down. There are no giants in Spain. You are badly informed. A little wine for Don Quixote. I've never seen one. - You have never sought. Do you fight with them? - Yes. And I have a beautiful young lady saved who was bewitched by a wizard. Giants. Wizards. Who has made you wise, Thurs Empty Head? Go home, edit the land. Stop 't build castles in the air. The giants and bewitched women exist only in your stupid head. May I suggest this company... I 't'm used to by stupid lazy idiot to be ascertained. Because I follow 't narrow path of the wandering knights. I despise wealth, but respect honor. Ýnjustice was done to those who helped reports and wizards. I'm in love, but am not a wicked worshiper. I will not hurt, I'm doing just fine. Are you really so happy and satisfied... Your safe and comfortable life? Are you satisfied with only eat and sleep? Do you want to or not new discoveries, adventure... Great deeds, eternal fame and a struggle for justice? My dear Duke and Duchess... Give your opinion. Can we someone who believes in 't knighthood... Discarded and ignored as if he had not his head? My Dulcinea is enchanted. She's a country girl at 'n ass... And not at all pretty. What should I do? You need to travel beyond the stars. He is the wisest man in Boratorio and knows all about magic. Boremeo There you will find... And he will be able to Dulcinea's spell. I undertake any journey as I Dulcinea can thus liberate. You should not only be on the road. Your squire will go with you. Not if we go on foot. But if we fall from the sky? If you are on the horse goes that I am giving you, you do not fall. Go away. I love you or in the holes from the roof. Ga them. You will be richly rewarded. I have an island for you. You're so bad, Sancho? I can not just let go. Say that island... This is the horse Clavileño. He will be Don Quixote and his servant beyond the stars bring. Master, I must tell you something. - Hush, Sancho. This horse will bring you to Boremeo. And Boremeo Dulcinea's spell will break. Journey beyond the stars. So the spell is broken. I will soon explore airspace in the name of my beloved Dulcinea. Hey, you might a pillow for me? The horse Clavileño may not carry extra weight. Cheer, Sancho. - But I'm not brave. Do you sometimes show a frightened mouse, a coward with a heart of butter? Boremeo expecting us. - Think of the island. Please, help me 's. Excellent. Put a blindfold on the men... Just in case the sun dazzles them and they fall. We rise. I hear the wind. All those important people look so like little ants. It is very hot, huh? - We fly toward the sun. , the great Boremeo... Recommend that the spell of the beautiful Dulcinea broken. When I get to see her? If your trip is over and your quest is finished. What to expect? You take your biggest challenge and achieve your greatest victory. We are being shelled. They buy it. So you have your loved one released. Congratulations. And you can receive your reward. Mr. Governor... Island Esperanza. - Listen, my good man... Is this really an island? I have not seen the sea. It's a big island. The sea is far away. A large island? Then there is a lot to get. I accept your island in all modesty. Thank you. A letter from the Duchess of Boratorio for Teresa Panza... Wife of Don Sancho, squire of Don Quixote of La Mancha. Mom, there's a man of the house. Are you Teresa Panza? - I am, yes. Madam Duchess... Writes: Sancho's wisdom and sincerity... - Pardon? , My husband help him decide Governor's island. There he's always been about. - So Hail, Lady Teresa... Wife of the governor. - Am I really lady Teresa? Yes, my lady. That you are sure. Well, my good man. I need you no longer need. Go ahead. And do the Duchess greetings. We can sleep no longer conceive... ...hear the nymphs sing their songs... ...the Don where we with all our hearts crave. Hear a sweet and innocent virgin. Hear her anguished sobs and sad... ...her heart hurts and you can heal her... ...you do it just to look at. Leave us alone. Why is there no Dulcinea to my faith to see? Why do I love ignite in hearts so young and beautiful? They swarm around you like bees to a honey pot. But why require them to me? You and I are both blessed with great beauty. Everyone is in love with us. But we can not help it. So try to bear that burden just. I'll try. None fruits. Soon you will be affected by your stomach. Who are you, sourpuss? - Your doctor. I watch your health. Fruit is too cold and contains too much moisture. And this lamb... It smelled wonderful. - Too spicy. Roasted partridge. Rabbit Stew. Haired and fluffy food. Far too dangerous. Also take with me. But I'm here... A magical fluid. The only real elixir of life. Brandy? - Water. Attacks far, Governor. It is good for the skin... For your hair and your brains. Water as a meal? Take me to my bedroom. After this meal of nothing fall I almost fainted from hunger. Wake up. The alarm bells. Our enemies want to conquer the island. The Duke knows that our troops will argue. Grab your sword and triumph. We await your orders. - Arm 'm. Guys, I see nothing. I see nothing. Wait. Master... What are you doing here? I do not know why... But I missed you. I'm sure... ...so accustomed to your company and deeds... I can not live without you. Friend Sancho. Moreover, I have enough of the island. The Island of the duke? - Yes, yuck. They starved me and I had to rely on the troops. There was nothing to get. Believe me, the governorship is worth nothing. That's right, Sancho. I am the soft sheets came from... And the sweet words of love ladies. The banquets only make me hunger for adventure. Not yet 'n trumpet. A challenge. Do all that the Knight of the Moon... Knight with the 't Sorrowful Face throws the gauntlet... Called Don Quixote of La Mancha. Supposedly? Why so called? He challenges you to single combat your knighthood to prove. The conditions you hear on 't battlefield. Good luck, Don Quixote. - Who is the Knight of the White Moon? An alien who demanded redress. That he can get. Master, say it again works out of a disaster? No way. According Boremeo ga I my biggest victory. After everything we've been through? What are you trying to say, Sancho? I do not think you have too much on the big Boremeo should trust. Was this your idea? - No, I thought it was your idea. I know nothing about. Then that knight so real. Or me are all part of Don Quixotes fantasy. In any case very entertaining. These are my terms: If I win, I want you to cease your adventures... Returns home and stays there until you die. But if you give me beats, is my life in your hands. Knight of the White Moon, I know your deeds, not... And for me, secures your fame nothing. So I accept your terms. For fate has determined that I will overcome. I will defeat you in the name of lady Dulcinea of Toboso. So go ahead. I am willing to fight. Fight for me, great knight. Fighting if it were your last beat. Wake up, Don Quixote. The time for dreaming is over. So we go home? It's over? No more adventures? No, no more adventures. Why not? - I've got my word. A question of honor. What knight would I be if I kept my word? But that does mean boring evenings we meet. Beware giant, I am the knight errant and I will beat you. Fighting over. Trial 't steel of my sword. I kill you in the name of my beloved. My beloved. I will never again see her. Why? I have not completed my journey, I had 'm interrupting... Because of a promise. - Promises. Rare things that are. I make no promises. Where is your island? Let it go not talk about it any more. Good? Uncle. Dear uncle, you've been away so long. Where were you anyway? I was dreaming. I lived in 'n another world. Hopefully I'm going not miss too much. Come inside. Dear uncle. You'll be hungry. Dad, I've missed you. - Say that again. Our Sanchina has you terribly missed. And you have no island? I had 'n island. But a island gives too many headaches. I'd rather be home. And what have you done with your island? Do I returned. The title I liked it otherwise. I knew he was not an island. The master is back home. For him no more adventures. For us either. On Sancho Panza, my squire, I entertainment... All the money where he has passed. My friends let me gifts after... And all the remnant goes to my dear cousin Antonia. Such is my will. Do you want to sign, Don Quixote? Do not Don Quixote. Alonso Quixada. A gentleman of La Mancha. He has not much money... But a lot of good friends. You should have seen had us on our travels. I have twice met. U, Samson Carrasco? A time Knight of the Mirrors. When you beat me. True. That was a great victory. And again later. When? These are my terms: If I win, I want you to immediately cease your adventures. The Knight of the White Mon. So that was you. I would bring you home. So I had to overcome. No way, student literature. I myself conquered. The biggest win that you can wish. He is happy here. Even at night. He enjoys watching the stars. - So he's happy? You know, we have always tried to stop him . I always said that it all was nonsense. But now... I was thinking that way... What? That my old uncle wonderful things experienced. He has it ever thought about. And his eyes shine. Listen to my advice: Do not kill. You must not die. You still have many years of life. My friend. You have much to endure. It was a great time. Do not lie here. It is too early to die. We can go back on the road. Fighting with the Knight of the Mirrors. Or we go eat at the Duke and Duchess. It's over, Sancho. That time is over. Your adventure is now home with your wife and your children. Not really. I have a quest undertaken. O, yes? It certainly was not a success? - I do. I have brought you lady Dulcinea. Who are you? Dulcinea del Toboso. I think you're Aldonza. The girl that I once saw... When I came across' n wall looked. No Sir, I am lady Dulcinea. Your beloved. Maybe you do it both. So you see, master. Your adventure's success. You have found her. If my trip is over and my search is done. Thank you, my lady Dulcinea. Let me go alone, I'm tired.
