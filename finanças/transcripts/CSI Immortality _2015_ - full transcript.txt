Thank you. I haven't spoken to her about the case, but she's come in here voluntarily, so... please treat her with respect. Of course. RUSSELL: Dr. Kessler, thank you very much for coming in today. Obviously, we have a lot of questions for you about the bombings. And hopefully I can provide answers. SIDLE: I'll start, Dr. Kessler. As much as I'd like to roll out the "voluntary" red carpet, and welcome you here to your own bombing party, I can't find it in my bones to overrule my gut, so I'm just gonna ask you the obvious question. Are you or are you not behind the bombings? Your hostility connotes jealousy and resentment. It doesn't suit you, Sara. You know what, I'm not in the mood, Heather. I'd like you to answer my question. And I'd like some more tea. RUSSELL: Dr. Kessler, we'll get you some more tea in a moment, but... I do have a question for you. I came here to clear my name. Ask away. At your residence, our CSIs found a lot of blood in your living room. Not a drop of it was yours. Can you explain that? I came home after a long day and was surprised by an intruder. (both grunting) And you didn't bother to call the cops? No. After the death of my daughter Zoe and the vehicular murder of my granddaughter Alison, I've lost all faith in law enforcement. WILLOWS: What about the look-alike in your home? The lady who blew up in your car? I don't know who she was. I assume whoever's framing me sent her in to send Sara on a wild-goose chase. The only one sending us on a wild-goose chase is you. You only have your claws out because of the intimacy between your ex-husband and I. Now who's being hostile? Needle away, Sara. After all, I've been on both sides of the pricking. All right, okay. Clearly my presence here is distracting. I'm out of here. (door opens, closes) Ma'am... you mentioned being framed. Could that have anything to do with the missing client tapes? Sara found three months of mini cassettes missing from your office. Do you think whoever's framing you... Yes. How else would the bomber know about the gambling and mental issues of my patients? WILLOWS: Just breathe, Sara. She's only trying to get a rise out of you. And the more you let her get to you, the more control she has. I know. I-I'm sorry, I... I lost my cool. Damn it. Don't beat yourself up. I don't feel the way you do about Grissom, and I want to kill the bitch with my bare hands. I'm a woman; I know it when I see it. So does she. Remember that. I'm going back in. I shut down my practice the day my granddaughter died. The second she left this world, I lost everything that I ever cared about. I couldn't go on. I gave my patients three months notice and I retired. Is that why you sent your patient into my casino? To enact revenge on the world? You told Grissom that you were the one behind the bombings. I am. Is that a confession? I'm not implicating myself as the mastermind behind the bombings or the bombers. My suspicion is someone is framing me, and may be a former Red Room client of mine. I just don't know who or why. Can you provide a list of names? Of course I can. That's everyone. All 13 gold key members. May I? HEATHER: What are you doing? The blood found in your home was male. I'm eliminating the female suspects for now. Oh. May I? Why are they eliminated? They're dead. Heart attack, aneurysm, drug overdose, cancer. That leaves five. In your opinion, do you think one of these five men is the mastermind behind the bombings? I do. So... ...who are you? That's my I.D. card. I'm a mechanic at McCarran International Airport. We're the 11th-busiest airport in the world, with over a million surveillance cameras. Mr. Schember, do I have your consent to swab your mouth for a DNA sample? Oh, yeah. MAN: ♪ Ah... ♪ (carrying note) Mr. Wittington, I'm all done, sir. Mr. Territo, you can open your mouth, or I can get a court order to get your DNA another way, but I don't think you're gonna like it. How are you gonna... Thank you. Next! I was her first client, you know... Lady Heather. Congratulations. Open up, please. When she got you into her bed, you didn't want anything else. You want to do me a favor? Open your mouth and shut up. Thank you, Mr. Rooney. Thank you. May I ask you a personal question? Please. How long have you been in that wheelchair? For as long as I can remember. Negative. None of the five suspects' DNA matches the blood we found at Lady Heather's. It's a dead end. GRISSOM: Well, you won't be able to hold 'em. SIDLE: No. Just came from the hospital. Brass is gonna be fine. Giving the nurses hell, of course, but keeping them entertained. (chuckles) Hey, you. What you got there? You going somewhere? Me? No. It's Mr. Grissom's. Uh, did you forget your luggage? I found it outside the front door. That's not mine. It's not? It says your name on it. Bomb! Everybody out! Now! OFFICER: Everybody! (mechanical whirring in distance) ♪ ♪ Is that a human body? PHILLIPS: W-Wait a minute, Doc, hold up. I think there's something in his mouth. What is that? It's a micro SD card. "SD" as in secure digital. This is what you guys found inside the cadaver? Mm-hmm. What in the world is that? RUSSELL: Looks like some form of digital identity concealment. MAN (distorted): If you're watching this video, I want you dead. If you're not dead, you've been kept alive... for the purpose of psychological torture. Human heads will rip off shoulders. Bones will snap and fly from flesh. Innocent blood will stain and spill. Casino man and teacher lady... were just the beginning. The grand finale is specifically designed for you. I have DNA results on torso man. A curious name popped up in CODIS. Do you guys remember a man named Jacob Wolfowitz? He was convicted of killing Lady Heather's daughter years ago. He's also the man that Lady Heather almost killed, until you intervened. (groans loudly) Heather! Stop it! Let me finish! (grunting) You cannot do this! (crying): Please. I'm saying stop. (gasping, sobbing) It was Wolfowitz in that suitcase. Wasn't he sentenced to life in prison? ANDREWS: Well, he's out. Well, half of him, anyway. So, clearly, somebody out there is obsessed with Lady Heather, and by the looks of what we found in the suitcase... somebody might be obsessed with you, too. WILLOWS: Hard at work, I see. I am. Drawing sea creatures. Whales and sharks. Metaphor for Vegas, if you think about it. Whales bring the money in, the sharks take it away. Whales are bigger in size and stature, but they're the submissive. Sharks are smaller, but they're by far the more dominant. I think someone's out there playing the dominant, but he's really the submissive. Okay. Listen... (clears throat) I need a favor. The new girl... she's having a bit of a rough one. She thinks she let you down. I was hoping you might be able to help her process the suitcase, give her a little of that Grissom TLC? She could really use it. I'd rather not. I'm quite content here. Where did that girl come from, anyway? My vagina. You don't recognize her? Grissom, that's Lindsey. That's my daughter. RUSSELL: Oh, look at that. I got an ear. I got an ear! Wait. Did I... did I hear you right? You got an ear? Yeah, come here. I got a... yeah, I got an ear. This stuff's amazing. Whoever sent this video was using homemade software to swirl the image, right? So, pixel by pixel, I've been trying to reverse the digital concealment. It's like, uh, unscrambling scrambled eggs or something, but I-I got an ear. And we know that our bomber is Caucasian. SIDLE: From what we can surmise from the partially reassembled photo and the auditory voice analysis, the person in the video is Caucasian, 40's maybe. We also believe that the gender isn't female. Are you clearing me? I'm clearing you from being the person in the video. I've not ruled you out as a suspect. But you're not here alone without Grissom to show me a marbled face and shoddy audio. You're here for another reason, aren't you? I'm here, based on what I've shown you, to ask you if you have any idea who's behind this. (sighs deeply) I've had thousands of clients and patients come through my domain throughout the years. Any one of them can be after me for a million unforeseeable reasons. I'm not talking about you, Heather. This is about Grissom. Why would one of your clients or patients be after him? If you're not behind this, then help me. Help him. You're scared for him, aren't you? I am. Do you love him? I do. I believe you. You should. Do you? Do I what? Love him. No. I'm afraid I can't help you. That's the way, Lindsey. It's all in the wrist. What's our motto? Too much dust, the evidence may rust. Dust too lightly, it acts impolitely. Hmm. I got another one for you. Mm-hmm. Evidence may bare, even if rare. But it's what's not there that gives you a scare. That's my favorite one yet. Hmm... Wow. I think I might have one for you. Go ahead. I think I found a clue to thicken the plot. What doesn't belong... is "X" marks the spot. LINDSEY: Hey, I know what those numbers are. Latitude and longitude. Hmm. Clever girl. You want some company? I'm good, Mitch. (door creaks open) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (sighs) Dr. Grissom, meet Mr. SynDaver, the, uh, latest craze in the medical industry. These, uh, synthetic cadavers were all the rage last year at the surgeons' conference held in Boston. They allow doctors to perform surgeries without having to use real bodies. I prefer the real dead bodies. Me, too. (buzzing) Ow! Don't move, Doc. (buzzing) Sorry, my little Apis mellifera. Good work, Doc. Hmm. So what do you think? Cell phone towers? Insecticides? (buzzing) I mean, for you guys to bail on your queen like that, leaving her to fend for herself in the company of immature bees? No wonder colony collapse disorder is an issue in your hive. Hi. I was talking to the bees. Shocker. I heard you were in here. I thought maybe you could use some help. I'd love some. I miss working side by side with you. You and the bees. Question is, how did the bee get in the cadaver? I bee-lieve, Mr. Bee... rest in peace... hitched a ride from the woods. Taxonomy came back. Insecta, Hymenoptera, Aprocrita, Apoidea... Andrenidae. A mining bee. Forest area, Mount Charleston. GRISSOM: Sniffer bees. (buzzing) The world's greatest bloodhounds. So, you've already trained the bees with nectar, and each color-coded jar has its own individual recipe. And we place the open jars into six different regions on Mount Charleston, so we cover the whole forest. Okay, kids, take these and place them. Caps off. Use the maps. Follow your maps exactly. Now, all we have to do is paint the bees to match the color region, so we know where they've been. Green... northwest part of the forest, orange... southeast part of the forest. Once they're painted, we simply bid them adieu, and the search is on. When we release the colored bees, their first priority is to separate and find their nectar. While in flight, they naturally inhale everything in the forest, so when they return to their colored boxes, we can test their hives for the presence of humans in high elevations. So, if we get a hit, we'll know exactly where to look. First time for everything. GRISSOM: Excellent. Well done. Catherine... the swirl image... it wasn't designed just to conceal the face. It has friction ridges. It's an ulnar loop. No, no, this is a hidden fingerprint. ♪ ♪ (buzzing) Hey. Orange is back. Orange is region six. Man, they're fast. (rapid beeping) (electronic chirp) Human presence negative. So he's not in the southeast corner. We can eliminate that region. Five more to go. (taps keys, computer beeping) (buzzing) Hey, green is back. (rapid beeping) (electronic chirp) (computer beeping) Oh, my. Here you are. (buzzing) GRISSOM: Red's here. (rapid beeping) (electronic chirp) Finally, we got a hit. Red, human presence. Region two. 7,500 feet elevation. That's steep. Top of the mountain. Due north, Mount Charleston. Could be a hiker. Yeah. Could be a killer. WILLOWS: I got here as soon as I could. Still searching. (computer blipping rapidly) It worked. We got a hit. Sara interrogated that guy. He's one of the five gold key suspects. Greg, grab Morgan. We're heading out. We got a name and residence of the bomber: 1475 Coven Gardens Road. I'll meet you there. WILLOWS: Suspect's apartment is clear, but we have reports of suspicious activity in the parking garage. (car alarms blaring) (alarms continue blaring, horns honking) You seeing this?! The timers are synchronized. We have less than five minutes to figure this out. (sighs) ♪ ♪ WILLOWS: Dispatch, we are here at the Maggadino Apartments off of Coven Gardens. The entire garage is rigged with explosives on timers. The building is fully occupied. We are in grave danger. Repeat, we are in grave danger. OFFICER: Hold your fire! He's wired! Dalton Betton? How is that possible? Mister Grissom. His DNA wasn't a match. I push this button, your friends die. I pull this cord, we die. Finally... I have all the power. I hate to break it, but we don't have time for the bomb squad. This is our problem now. What kind of bomb is this? SANDERS: Daisy chain bomb. If one goes off, they all go off. Not to mention, there's enough C-4 in here to take down this entire apartment complex. Look, the only way out of this is we cut the wires at the same time. We each have to take a car. Cut on my verbal command. If we're a millisecond early or late, the bombs will detonate. This building is filled with civilians. We can't walk away from this. This is all or nothing now. Do or die. You with me? Yeah. (car alarms blaring) Mr. Betton, the illness you're concealing, is it cancer? Lymphoma. If one leaves his blood in Lady Heather's house while undergoing stem cell treatment, changing the genetic complexion of his DNA, does that make him two different people? Scientifically, I have two genetic makeups. Your cheek swab will tell you that. Philosophically, I sent those people in to do my dirty work. All for the purpose of coming face-to-face with you. WILLOWS: Four colors here. Orange, yellow, red, black. Red, black. Okay, we've got less than two minutes! I want you to carefully take out your wire cutters and steady the blades around the plastic coating of the red wire! I repeat, the red wire! Ticktock... ticktock. What do you want? His life. He ruined her. He took her away from me the moment he stopped Lady Heather from killing Wolfowitz. I was the first client. I was the first man she slept with in the dungeon. And then you came along and you turned her heart. She quit role-playing because of you. She quit her practice because of you. She quit me... because of you. And now... everything Heather and I once had is gone. You can't lose something you never had, Mr. Betton. Lady Heather never slept with you. She never slept with any of her clients or her patients. But you've been emotionally attached to her. Haven't you? Question now is... how attached are you to that bomb? (scoffs) All right, listen to the sound of my voice! We snip on "one." I love you guys! (shuddering sobs) Counting down from ten... nine... eight... seven... Oh, shoot! Oh... six, five... Got it? Yeah. Two... one! Boom. Your friends are dead. I don't think so. You see, I know about bombs. I know about oceans, too. There's a great mammal in the ocean known as the 52-hertz whale. All year, he practices his love song for the female. Travels thousands of miles to find her. But when he finally gets the chance to serenade her, she doesn't give him a call back. Why? His love ballad is sung at 52 hertz, a sonic signature one note higher than the lowest sound of a tuba. The average female hears at ten to 15 hertz. So she never hears his song. They call him the lonely whale. And year after year, for a hundred years, he works on a new love song and never, ever gets a call back. Eventually, he dies off, forever alone... ...heart breaking. But you've been calling out, too. You've been calling out for Lady Heather's love. (gasping sob) But she's not calling back, is she? And the frightening part, for you, is... she never will. (gasping sob) Don't. You don't have all the power. Do you? Go ahead. Pull it. (cries, sniffles) (sobs quietly) (sobbing deeply) Honey, it's okay, it's okay. We did it. We did it. Okay. Good team. Yeah. Ah, Jules. Wherever I go, you go. (knocking on glass) Heading out? Yeah. Yeah, I'm... not one for big good-byes... cakes, candles and hullabaloo. Well... I'm not one for good-byes, either. Which is why I'd like to put my hat in the ring for that director position. I mean, if Sara doesn't take it. Really? Yeah, I'm coming back home. Vegas is in my blood. I have my daughter Lindsey. And just... so much of what my father left behind is here. Not to mention those two little girls who don't have anyone. All reasons to come back where I belong. Home. And you are heading east, yeah? Yeah, yeah. Opportunity knocked. Never too late to start a new chapter, as they say. Nice. So... can I help you carry anything? Uh, no, actually. I-I got it. Um... Everything that's in my mind and... and in my heart is right here in this box. ECKLIE: Okay, okay, one more, one more. MAN: This way, Sheriff. WOMAN: Got enough. Thank you. Great, great. Thanks, guys. Congratulations, Sara. Thanks, Conrad. Mm. Talk to you later. MAN: You guys might like that one better. MAN 2: Good work, sir. MAN 3: Congratulations. (chuckles) Thank you. I never thought I'd see this day coming. But with D.B. out... You deserve it. Vegas is lucky to have you. The oceans are lucky to have you. Ironic, isn't it? I'm the one that always wanted to get out of Vegas, and you're the one who thought you would never leave. Yeah. Well... So... I hope you find what you're looking for out there. Bye, Gil. That's it. We're done. Thanks for your statement. The D.A. may ask you to testify, but that's entirely up to you. Sure. Whatever helps. Heather... (sighs) ...before I get back on my boat... ...I wanted to thank you. Thank me for what? When we first met, I-I... had a shell around my heart. I'd lost my belief in humanity. The only truth I... I knew was empirical science. I-I just wanted to thank you for... ...opening my heart. Through you, I learned to love someone. Sara? She restores my faith in the human being. Plus... ...she helped me with my crossword puzzles. She's been my best friend. I'll miss her. For the rest of my life. LINDSEY: Hey, Sara, front desk asked for me to deliver this.
