(people laughing) (ominous music) (waves crashing) - 11 innings and the Cubs are still in the (indistinct) losing to the Phillies six to two. And now for all you fans who've ever wondered who is more macho. Well, today was the running of the Survival of the Fittest Race in San Diego County. 50 athletes from all over the world competed in what has to be the toughest competition in sports today. Participants had to run, jump, climb, run, spin, crawl. - Here's one, a freelance of (indistinct) Corsican, three names, untraceable. I'm afraid we're running out of candidates. - Our guests have strange and unique appetites that will not be satiated by simple, usual affair, especially after last time. - [News Anchor] Collins won the race in a record three hours and nine minutes which is nothing short of miraculous (dramatic music) when you consider all the obstacles these guys had to overcome. As winner of the race, Collins takes a reverse of $10,000 in cash prizes. Not to the mention all the Epsom salt he can use. (crowd cheering) (dramatic music) (fax machine running) So the next time you guys are standing around the water cooler debating who is more macho, now you know, it's Matt Collins. This is Jodi Tomlin, Channel 3 Sports. - Inform the guests, the games are on. And summon the boat, I want you to take personal charge of this expedition. - But my duty's here. - It can wait. After the debacle of last time, I will risk no failures. (dramatic music) You do not fear me. - I only fear you losing faith in me. (arrow firing) - That's our man. Bring him back alive. (upbeat rock music) ♪ I've got a brand new shirt - Ah yeah. - One regular deluxe, one salad and your usual. - Thank you, sweetheart. - Enjoy. - I will. Cheers. - Cheers. - So anyways there we were in Panama. - I thought it was Guatemala. - Guatemala and by now this guy's all by himself in the middle of the jungle. - Yeah, well, my support team was accidentally dropped 10 miles in the other direction. - Right and they end up being ambushed, so I drop in, I'm hauling guys out, there's machine gun fire, mortar fire. - I didn't know what to do, my orders were to wait for the unit, so I waited. (men laughing) - Wait, I don't get it. - I waited for three days before anybody knew I was still out there. - Three days all by himself behind enemy lines. That to me is a true test in survival. - Ah, if you think that's funny, wait till he tells you about my jungle rot. (dramatic guitar music) ♪ If I ever - So why do they call him Skylord? - 'Cause he's the best damn chopper pilot in the history of aviation. - Well, that's hard to believe. - Ah, all birds look clumsy on the ground, up in the air there's nobody better. There's another ending to that story. - What is it? - My position had been betrayed only I didn't know it. Skylord knew and he broke through the ground fire, got me out, saved my life. That's why I put up with all his shit. - Hey, you move over, my turn okay? - No. - She's with me. - Oh, yeah, fuck off, huh? - I said she's with me! - Oh yeah. (fist punching) Come on tough guy show me what you got okay? Come on tough guy you want more? - Come on let it go. - Put it up there. Go ahead. (bones cracking) (man hollering) That's my finger, let me go you puke! Let go, let go! (fists punching) (glass shattering) (man groaning) - Tell our friend he's lucky he's drunk. - Let's go. (Skylord laughing) Feel my heart. - Come on. - Let him down the stairs would you please? - Let's go, come on. Walk fast. (men laughing) (dramatic music) (water splashing) - So how is he? - Sleeping like a baby. But I'm getting too old to be putting him to bed like one. - So you coming in? - What do you give me? - How about this. - That works for me. - Matt, batting cages! - Sleeping like a baby huh? - He will after I bat him. - Yeah and there's a bridge for sale in Brooklyn.

Skylord made an interesting comment. - What? - He said it's like you're on fire. - Oh yeah, what else did he have to say? - Nothing you know Skylord. - Yeah. - I guess he means you have something unfinished in your life, something holding you back. (slow music) Maybe now that you won the race we could start. - We can what? - Nothing, I was just thinking. - Well, don't think all right. I can think for myself, I don't need anybody planning my life. - Excuse me. (slow music) (smooth music) (engine revving) (ominous music) Matt? Matt? Matt, did you hear me?

(Matt laughing) Hey look, that 10 grand will hold you over for awhile. - Yeah but after taxes and insurance and rent, I'm right back to where I was at the beginning, zippo. I don't wanna be living off my wife. - Now you're starting to sound old-fashioned. - Yeah, you know me, Skylord an old-fashioned kind of guy. - Matt? - What are you doing here? - What kind of stunt was that to pull? Why did you leave me and what does this note mean? What's going on here? - Hey look it, I'm gonna run out and get a little breakfast, can I borrow the car keys? - Look, you don't have to go, Sky. - I know, I'll come back for you. - What'd you do that for? - Funny, that's what I was asking you. - I don't wanna talk to you about it right now. - Well, I do. (engine revving) I'm not attacking you here, I just wanna talk about what happened this morning? - Change of plan, take them both. You are very lucky. - So what is it about me that frightens you so, huh? Come on, I'm not taller than you are, I don't have bigger muscles than you do. I can't even swing a bat as well as you can. So what is it, what? - You know? - What that I make more money than you do? What's so scary about that? - 'Cause that's what counts in this world. You could be the biggest, lamest, wimpiest geek but if you got money, that's all that matters. - If you thought that way why didn't you stay in the Army? (slow music) - I was the best soldier in that outfit, everyone knew it, so what did they do, they make me an instructor. They fill me up to my eyeballs with all this training and then they tell me I can't use it! So what do I do to get even, I become a civilian. Brilliant, brilliant, now if I use my training, they'll throw me in jail. Lauren, you deserve someone better than me. - You're wrong, I deserve someone who knows what's real, honor, loyalty, devotion. That's really what you need to build family. (dramatic music) - What did you say? - I'm trying to say I would be proud to be your wife. - Yo, hey buddy, hey can you help me over here please? - Hold that thought. - How you doing? - How do you work this thing? - Simple just throw in your tokens. - Tokens. - Yeah, you gotta get yourself some tokens over there at the booth. - [Man] No wonder it wasn't working huh? (woman screaming) - Lauren! (Matt grunting) (dramatic music) (engine revving) - Hey excuse me, hey what happened to the guy and the girl? - Who? - We were over in cage six, what happened to them? - Hey, do I look like a secretary over here? (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - What the fuck are you doing with Lauren's car? - She asked me to pick it up for her. - Bullshit. - Ah, let go damn it! - What the hell is this? - Oh Jesus. - Part of some sicko club? - I didn't wanna do it but she wanted them both, it was the lady's idea. - What lady? - I don't know her name, she's Chinese or something. (stick thumping) - You didn't kill him did you? We weren't paid to kill nobody. - You talk too much. (dramatic music) (waves crashing) (Matt coughing) (dramatic music) - You're awake, good, I was beginning to grow concerned. - How touching. - The affects of the chloroform will dissipate shortly. I brought you some soup and rice to help settle your stomach. Later you'll be summoned to dinner. - Where am I? - In time, you will have answers to all of your questions. Bambi will remain outside to see that no harm comes to you. - Bambi, what's the other one called Thumper? - Exactly. - Hey, where's Lauren? What have you done with her? - She's safe for now. Cooperate with us and she will have nothing to fear. - What do you mean nothing to fear? - Hey, answer me! - It is time for you to bathe and dress for dinner. One of these should fit you. - Where's Matt? - He's here and in good health. - What do you want with us? - Right now we want you to prepare for dinner. - I'm not gonna prepare for anything until you tell us what is going on here! - Then we shall be compelled to assist you. (dramatic music) Mr. Matthew Collins. (chains rattling) - Ah, Mr. Collins, long last we meet. - A phone call would have sufficed. - What a sense of humor, that's not usually something I require but how refreshing to encounter it. Of course you'll be staying for dinner. - I'm on a diet. - I must insist. I would feel like such a terrible host if you didn't at least enjoy the bounty of my lord. - What is this Just in case I don't like the food? - It's a regrettable but necessary precaution. Mrs. Ling, I believe we are ready for the rest of the guests. - Please be seated gentlemen. - Gentlemen, welcome, welcome one and all, I'm very pleased that each of you could join us on such short notice. Now without further ado, I would like to introduce you to our guest of honor, may I present Mr. Matthew Collins. - Miss Lauren Saddler. - Oh please, my dear, sit here. I'm afraid that I can't let you actually join your friend just yet. You'll just have to bear with me on that. Miss Saddler's appearance is due entirely to courtesy of Mrs. Ling, she felt that her presence here might lend a certain spice. And I dare say she's right. Well, Leslie, we are all ready to be served I believe. I trust none of you are vegetarians. (men laughing) - Like I said, I got here just as soon as they checked my head out. - Maybe you stumbled onto a breaking and entering. - I told you he had Lauren's car, he was coming out, he didn't have nothing on him. Oh yeah, you said that, cigarette? - I'm trying to quit. - So am I. - So what about the tattoo. - What'd you say it looked like again? - It was like two triangles. Kinda like this. You know it. - Can't say that I do. Let me run it by the boys on gang detail. - All right, so what do we do? - Nothing I'm afraid. - Yeah but they could have been kidnapped. - Yeah, they could have been kidnapped or they could be hold up in some cozy hideaway sorting out their love life. - Give me a break. - Well you said it yourself, they were having a lover's spat, you took off to give them some privacy, you came back, they were gone. - Yeah, but I got his car and her car's back in the garage. - She had someone return her car for her. You come crashing in like Rambo and the guy's buddy conks you, probably thought you were a thief. - God. - Sit down. Look, if you don't hear from them in 24 hours, let me know, I'll put out a missing persons. Personally though I don't think they wanna be found. - Gentlemen, before I enumerate Mr. Collins' rather unique attributes, I think we should get quickly acquainted. I'm Danton Vachs, your host and I'm sponsor of these games. - Call me Iceman. Simplest description of my background, soldier of fortune. - I'm Mr. Chen, up till recently I was working at the executive operations for the KCIA. - Apache. - That's it? - It's enough. - The name's Temple. Although an attorney by profession, it's my extracurricular activities that has won me infamy. Hunting is how I relax. - [Dan] And last but not least we have Mr. Cross. - Why don't you just cut the crap, Dannyboy. I sat through this shit the last time and the idiot you picked then was a complete washout. - I will strongly urge the gentleman to join into the spirit of the proceedings. - Yeah, well fuck the proceedings. I'm out 100g's and I barely got a sweat on my balls for my trouble. I don't know about the rest of these gentlemen here but that's a lot of fucking money to me Vachs. - What do you say? - First crack at the mark, that's what I'm saying. - Ah, that's not how we play the game. - That's how I'm playing this fucking game. - Oh well, one hour lead on the others. - What the hell? - No, no, no, no, no, Mr. Cross here has raised an issue regarding a somewhat botched former outing. My hands are tied. - Very nice. Let's get on with it. (man screaming) (man hollering) (man grunting) (man kicking) (man gurgling) (Lauren gasping) - Mrs. Ling, would you see that our late Mr. Cross is properly disposed of. (dramatic music) And pick him up you idiot, I just had this floor cleaned. Please, everybody, please sit down, I'm sorry really, I apologize for the altercation. Miss Saddler, please sit down. (dramatic music) Where was I? Oh yes, if our late compatriot had not been quite so impatient, he would have discovered that Mr. Collins is a rare prize indeed. Would you like to elaborate Mr. Collins? - Don't let me stop you, you're on a role. - Until recently Mr. Collins was a lieutenant in the United States Army Special Forces. He's considered to be an expert in jungle survival and in hand to hand combat. And just the other day he won the Survival of the Fittest Race in San Diego. So gentlemen as always the victor goes to death ring. A toast to the hunt. - [Men] To the hunt! - What hunt? - A manhunt Mr. Collins. The man we'll be hunting is you. (dramatic music) No matter how cunning an animal or how vicious it is an animal will not plan your death. And that was the feeling, the feeling that I might at any moment walk into premeditated mortal danger. I craved that. - You should have done a tour of duty in Nam, you'd have had all the thrills you need. - Oh no doubt but you see the true hunter can not work in a pack, the true hunter must work alone, isn't that right, Mrs. Ling? - Oh, you're being far too modest. I discovered Mrs. Ling in 1977 in Ho Chi Minh City, she was an outcast there, her father was an American, tainted blood and it was corrupting the purity of the revolution. But during the war, the NLF didn't care so much about that did they Mrs. Ling? - No sir. - How many Americans did you kill? - 17. - And how old were you then, Mrs. Ling? - I was 14 years old. - I had recognized a kindred spirit so I rescued her. You see Mr. Collins, we are all hunters each and every one of us and each of us is the prey. And just because you were obeying the orders of some long forgotten commander in chief does not imbue you within the superior moral position. - Bullshit! - Are you taking the position that some people did not deserve to live? - Yeah and you're candidate number one. - Well, Mr. Collins, I'm taking the position that you do deserve to live. That is if you are smart enough to stay alive. (dramatic music) Miss Saddler get some rest, tomorrow's gonna be a very exciting day for you. - Whatever you want. - What? - You can have me any way that you want, just let him go. - Oh, Miss Saddler, I'm not Caligula, my only desire is a good hunt. - Then why I am? - Are you here? Motivation. Left to himself, your friend would wish only to survive but give the prey the gift of an added reason to prevail and then might he not only strive to survive but actually attack. And that would be the greatest sport of all. I wish you pleasant dreams. (dramatic music) (engine revving) - My husband's going to be so surprised, I bet he won't even notice it. - Hey how you doing man? I'm thinking about getting another tattoo. - Yeah, well, I got pictures of most of what I done. And if you want something special, I can do that too. - Well, that's good 'cause I'm kinda looking for something special. I'm thinking about maybe two triangles on top of each other. I heard maybe you'd done a few. You wouldn't remember who you did this for would you? - I got a bad memory. - Really? (man hollering) (fists punching) (men scuffling) - No more man, no more, it's on the back of the picture. Fuck. (dramatic music) - Each of you hunters will be wearing a radio so that I will be able to monitor your progress. We are on an island, Mr. Collins and except for ourselves, we are completely uninhabited. We are 150 miles from the nearest coastline, just barely a dot on the navigational charts. - Are you really so stupid to think that nobody's looking for me? - Oh, they very well may be Mr. Collins but I rather doubt that they're going to find you before we finish the game, so shall we commence. Mrs. Ling. Iceman, four, ah, the (indistinct). Number two how appropriate the spear. (man hollering) - One, (indistinct) another appropriate pairing. (man gasping) Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, no playing in the house children. - Three. - The gorat. - Perfect fit. - I don't get a weapon? It's not very sporty now is it? - You already have your weapon, Mr. Collins. A very deadly weapon, you have your brain. - Not for long. (dramatic music) - Well, I wish you absolutely the best of luck. - Yeah, I bet you do. - You'll be getting a four hour head start, so I would use your time well. This is not a large island, you won't be able to evade the hunters. - Where's Lauren? - Oh right about now I would say getting a massage. - I swear to God if you hurt her in the slightest. - My intentions toward the lady is strictly honorable. You evade the hunters, you and the lady are free as a bird. - Yeah and what if I don't, what happens to her? - I'll give it some thought, I'm sure I'll think of something. - Bastard! - Use that anger, Mr. Collins, use it to keep yourself alive. You have four hours, I would get started. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (man chanting) (man hollering) (exercise machine clanking) - Respect is the flower of true strength. - When it blossoms all things are possible. - I'm glad to see your knowledge is not limited to the West. - Eastern philosophy is a passion of mine but lately it's been difficult to pursue. - The investigation, I've heard about it. - An annoyance, flies buzzing a horse, they'll never prove it was me. - I myself would just kill you. - And I'm grateful that you are not in law enforcement. (dramatic music) (tree cracking) (wood chopping) (dramatic music) (cloth ripping) - What's going on Vachs. - Oh, just a little something that I've picked up in my travels in Indonesia. - You see when the men there anticipate a rather long night of carnal pleasure and they wish to enhance their virility. Well, they drink snake blood and I've discovered through personal experience that it works just as well for our field of endeavor, in fact, there's nothing quite like the smell of the fresh kill to get your blood going. (dramatic music) My advice gentlemen, just think of it as an authentic bloody Mary. I have a feeling this hunt is going to provide us with a worthy owner for the death ring so, good hunting gentlemen. (dramatic music) (man hollering) (climactic music) (suspenseful music) (water splashing) (water splashing) - Hmm. (man hollering) Vachs was right, you are better than the others. - Damn straight. (men grunting) (men grunting) - This is Mr. Chen, I have found Collins and we'll be returning shortly. - I had hopes that he would last all night long. - I always heard that you Green Beret maggots are very good at martial arts. - That's what they say. (men grunting) (men grunting) (men grunting) (men grunting) (men grunting) (men grunting) (man hollering) (dramatic music) - Ah, it is finished. - [Matt] Vachs, I hope you can here me, 'cause your Mr. Chen is now mister dead. That's one down and three to go then I'm coming after you. - Mr. Collins, I congratulate you on your fortitude, however I have my doubts that I shall ever see you again alive. (suspenseful music) - This came in last night. - Is it Matt? - You tell me. Jesus. - Yeah. - I figure they took an industrial sander to his fingertips. I don't know if they carved him up before or after he died. You know who he is? - Yeah, it's the guy I caught driving Lauren's car. - You sure? - Sure as I'm sitting here. - That tattoo you saw belongs to a bunch of satanists, seem to hang out near Palimar. - What? - This town is ideal for them, Mexico is a half hour away. We've got over a dozen missing persons we think they're responsible for. And on occasion we get somebody like that poor guy on the slab. - Whoa, so what are you trying to tell me? - I'm trying to tell you they're dangerous, they don't like anybody nosing around in their affairs. - So why didn't you tell me this yesterday? - I didn't see a connection. - Oh but now you think there is. - Look, there's a good chance those sick fucks got your friends and if they did, there's an even better chance they're gonna wind up like that man in there. - So go after them. - I can't, all I have is suspicion. - I don't fucking believe it. (body slamming) (man laughing) - All right, you look like a guy who can take care of himself. Here you dropped this. Keep in touch. (ominous music) (gun cocking) - Sky, it's me. - Cindy, don't ever sneak up on me like that. What are you doing here? - We had a date remember? - Tonight? - Hmm-mm, we were supposed to celebrate, I forget what. So happy whatever fly boy. - Look, Cindy, I'd like nothing more than to stay here with you but I'm gonna have to take a rain check. - What? - It's an emergency. It's a matter of life or death. - Skylord Harris I bought this outfit just for you, it's your favorite color. - I've gotta go. - And it wasn't on sale. (dramatic music) - Whoa, god! I sure hope nothing lives in here. (engine revving) (man knocking) - We're closed. - You're opened now. - The money's in here, take it and leave, it's not much. Business has been slow lately. - I'm looking for Jessup. - I don't know anyone by that name. - I think that you do. What the hell is this a hicky? - You dare touch the daughter of Isis! (gun cocking) (gun firing) (gun firing) (dramatic music) - [Man] Who told you to look for Jessup? - The police. - I didn't know you were a police officer. - No, are you Jessup? - I am not the man the police say I am. You still have not found him and you never will. He only exists in their minds. - Then who the hell are you Billo Lagosi? - [Man] I thought you were looking for Jessup. - Why don't you give me a straight fucking answer! (man laughing) - Do you think you can intimidate me with your anger. You'll be dead in 30 seconds if I so desire it. And you will never see your friends again. Some of my family has strayed, they enter alliances that draw unto attention to me. They labor under the ludicrous presumption that I will not find them out. Tell him. I would rather not repeat myself. - Island off Mexico, 150 miles. - What, 150 miles from where, from San Diego? - [Man] Take him. - What will happen to him? - Trust me, you don't want to know. (dramatic music) (mysterious music) (men grunting) (suspenseful music) - Who the hell are you? Are you being hunted too? There's three hunters after me. - Only three? - There were five, one of them I killed, Vachs got the other. One of them had a serious attitude problem. - My name's Matt Collins. - John Blackwell. - So what brings you to this charming island? - Somebody thought I'd make a good hunt, they were wrong. - The guy Vachs killed, he was talking about the hunt that went wrong. - That was me. On this other side of the island there's this swamp, it's got some quick sand in it, I left a trail leading right up to it, hoping they'd think that I fell in. - That's a pretty slick trick. - Well, these guys they want fighters, I guess they figured since I was a survival instructor that I'd be some Daniel Boone type. What they got is somebody who's real good at hiding. - Until I dropped in. - Don't feel bad, that's how I found the place, only I fractured my leg in the fall, so I've been hold up here for the past couple of months. - A couple months huh? I want you on my side. - I don't think I have much choice do I? - I got a ruler here someplace. - Right here it is. - Okay, let's see, see, see. All right, whatever's out here is on my jurisdiction. - What about that? - I don't know, looks like an island to me. - It's in the sea lanes? - No, well clear of it. - Still out of your jurisdiction. - Yes, goddamn it. - Well, it ain't out of mine. (engine revving) Hey honey the ranger booked? - Wouldn't know. - Look, it's not like I don't wanna be with you, I just got an emergency. - That outfit cost me $69.95 plus tax. - Look, if I get back I promise we'll spend the next three days together. - Maybe and what do you mean if? Where are you going? - War games. (helicopter whirling) (suspenseful music) - Hey what do I tell the boss? (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) - Is there any way off this island? - No, well there is a boat that comes from the mainland but it comes well-guarded. - What by those two girls? - Mm-mm, you didn't see the guards he has, eight guys with machine guns. - We've gotta get to that radio room. Just two minutes in there. - It ain't likely pal. I mean, the two guys with sticks and stones against eight guns. - What else are we gonna do? We can't wait, he's got my fiance. - What about the hunters? - They wouldn't expect us to be going back to the mansion now would they? - You got a point there. And the guards wouldn't expect us with the hunters still out but we still don't have weapons. - I've been trained in silencing sentries, bare-handed if necessary. - You ever done it? - No. Look, why don't you cover the tracks, I'll be back in a few minutes, I'm gonna go do a little recon. (dramatic music) - I'm on him. He's mine. - I think the next time we should have some video. (mysterious music) (man grunting) (suspenseful music) This will be good. (suspenseful music) (man hollering) - Oh man. (men grunting) (fists punching) (men grunting) (men grunting) (men grunting) (men grunting) (slow music) (men grunting) (dramatic music) (men grunting) (men grunting) (man hollering) - [Matt] Vachs, Apache's dead, that's two. Two more and I'm coming after you. - Matt, you okay? I heard all that yelling, I figured. - Shit, I guess you took care of it. - Mr. Blackwell. - That's right, Vachs, it's me, I'm back from the dead and I'm ready to kick your ass. - Find it. - So the netherworld couldn't stomach a coward, vomiting you back up. - Oh cut the guy some slack, Dannyboy, he outfoxed you all. - Oh, you don't have too much longer to go, Mr. Collins, even with the rather dubious assistance of Mr. Blackwell. You remain the prey. - It ain't over till it's over. - Mr. Collins? Collins? Did you get the position? - They're in the northeast quadrant. - [Dan] All hunters, our prey has defeated Apache, he's in the northeast section. And he's been joined by a former runner. That's correct, Mr. Blackwell still lives. - A two-for, how exhilarating. - He will come after you. - I know, I welcome the challenge. - He's the one. - Yes. We must prepare. (dramatic music) (Lauren grunting) - Stop shoving. - Ah, Miss Saddler, looking more beautiful with each passing moment. - Go to hell. - Seems no matter how gracious I have become, I receive nothing but insults. - Many do not know how to show respect. - That's true, but we must go and educate Miss Saddler into the ways of this island. May be slow going, painfully slow going but for the moment I would like you to be a witness to the end game, your friend is doing very well. He has defeated two of the hunters. Two more are closing in. (dramatic music) - Iceman, I see them, I'm in pursuit. - Looking for someone. You spotted them, you get first crack. - You follow them, I wanna cut them off. - Good thinking. (man grunting) (knife chopping) But I really think you ought to stay here. - Interesting. (dramatic music) - The tree line's closer to the far end of the house. We'll approach it from there. - Fine then what? - I don't know, we'll just have to make it up as we go along. - What do you mean we? - Don't worry. Look, why don't you head back to the river bend, I'll catch up to you. (dramatic music) (Matt hollering) (man grunting) That was the Iceman's. - The Iceman has melted, I've never lost at anything, not at law, not with woman, not at games. I'm grateful for you being so skilled, it has kept me from my first failure. - Jury's still out on this case. - I heard they reached a verdict. (suspenseful music) (man grunting) (fists punching) (Matt grunting) (blood splattering) (Matt moaning) - So is he dead? - First thing we do is kill all the lawyers. - If we ever get out of this, I'm gonna need some serious x-rays. - He said Iceman's dead. Vachs, Vachs can you hear me, they're all dead, Vachs every one. - Congratulations, Mr. Collins, you have become the first prey to survive the hunt. You should feel very honored. - I feel very ticked. What about our agreement, I've beaten the game, now release Lauren. - Oh I don't know, I see it more as a tie. - But. - I think the game should go into sudden death. - Well, wait a minute, wait. - Get her out of here. - [Dan] And the winner of the next round gets to keep the girl. - Vachs, Vachs answer me! He's dead. (suspenseful music) - Are you still gonna do this? - Yeah. - I was afraid you were gonna say that. - Look in a few minutes, there's only gonna be a few guards at the end of the house. You remember what I showed you? - Yeah, grab him by the jaw and pull his head back and. - Cut his throat. - Yeah. - Just do it by the numbers, everything is gonna be fine. - How can that be enumerate. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (man grunting) - Hey! (suspenseful music) (rapid guns firing) (men grunting) (rapid guns firing) (man grunting) - They're all ready. Mrs. Ling, see that Miss Saddler's ready. (suspenseful music) (rapid guns firing) (helicopter whirling) - All right! (gun firing) (bomb exploding) (men hollering) (helicopter whirling) - The air calv's arrived, come on. (gun firing) (man grunting) - There's Skylord, stay with him and protect our escape. If I'm not back in 15 minutes, level this place. (helicopter whirling) (guns firing) (bomb exploding) (gun firing) - Guess who. (gun firing) (man grunting) (helicopter whirling) (dramatic music) - Hold it, drop the gun, stay right where you are. - I'm with Matt, I'm on your side I hope. - Where is he? - He has to get the girl. - All right, come on. (Lauren grunting) - What's the matter, are you afraid I'll get away? - The master has a plan. - Yeah, well, he's gonna need more than a plan. Do you hear that helicopter up there, you people are dead. - As you can see we are very much alive. Bitch! - Mrs. Ling, see to the others. (ominous music) - What do you want? - Nothing yet. - Look, turn me loose and you might just live through this. - What sort of life might that be, 20 years locked up in a tiny little cell? I think not. - Bang! (gun firing) - Now is the time, we must make this realistic. (Lauren gasping) - Lauren! (Lauren gasping) (woman hollering) - You Americans were always too weak with women. (woman hollering) (glass breaking) - Ladies first. Lauren! - I'm in here! - What did he do to you? - I'm okay. Hey Matt. - Mr. Collins, it's a beautiful pleasure to see you again. - The pleasure's gonna be all mine. (suspenseful music) (knife chopping) (metal clanking) (men grunting) (metal clanking) (metal clanking) (men grunting) (metal clanking) - Very, very good. - I'm better than that. (metal clanking) (men grunting) (metal clanking) (men grunting) (Matt hollering) (Dan gasping) (Lauren crying) (metal clanking) (dramatic music) (Matt exhaling) - I've waited long enough, I'm going in. - Here they come. - Hey boy you look like shit. - Yeah, it's good to see you too. - What about Vachs? - Ah, he lost his head. Why don't you go up front. It's Blackwell, I wouldn't have made it without him. - Let's get cracking, we got weather coming. - Matt, wait where are you going? - Keep it running, I'll be right back! (woman hollering) - You could have killed him after he lived. - No! - Damn it. - Oh my god shoot her. - I don't have a clean shot. (man grunting) (woman grunting) (woman hollering) (gun firing) (dramatic music) (helicopter whirling) - Man, I can't believe I'm actually on my way home. - Yeah, well I can't believe I found you guys. What the hell was going on down there? - Like something out of your worst nightmare man, I don't even know where to begin. - Yeah, how about the beginning. We got a long flight pal. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Did he hurt you? - Not really. - That's good. Did you really mean what you said before all of this? - What about you, did you really mean what you said? - I did at that time but not anymore. - Then my answer is yes. - I was hoping you'd say that. (slow music) - What did you go back into the house for? - To collect my prize, the death ring. (helicopter whirling) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music)
