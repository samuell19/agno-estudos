THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI, IT'S SUSAN BERLANGER. HAVE I GOT ANY MESSAGES? MR. SCHNEIDER CALLED FROM NEW YORK. PARIS AND AMSTERDAM ARE SET, AND ROME IS A STRONG POSSIBILITY. ANYTHING ELSE? FRANK CALLED FROM DALLAS. HE'LL BE BACK FRIDAY. THINK ABOUT WHAT HE ASKED YOU. HE'S GOING BACK TO DALLAS SOON. IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT, YOU SHOULD DO IT BEFORE THEN. YOUR CALLS ARE ALMOST AS INTERESTING AS A HOOKER'S. OH, THANKS. JACK WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU'LL MEET HIM FOR COFFEE. ONE SHOULDN'T DATE HER ANSWERING SERVICE. IT'S LIKE DATING YOUR GYNECOLOGIST. WHY'S THAT? YOU KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT ME. WE'VE NEVER MET. I LOVE YOUR VOICE. MY VOICE LOVES YOU, TOO. GOOD NIGHT, JACK. I'M NOT FRESCHETTI'S KIND OF DANCER. IF I STAY, I'LL BE IN THE CORPS FOREVER. WHEN THE SEASON'S OVER, I'M GOING TO NEW YORK TO TRY MY LUCK. WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU NEVER FALL INTO THE PIT, SO YOU MUST BE PRETTY GOOD. I MEAN, I CAN'T DANCE LIKE YOU PLAY THE FLUTE. I PLAY ALL RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU STAY IN THE PIT WITH YOUR TALENT. THIS AGENT IS BOOKING ME EUROPEAN RECITALS. I'D HAVE TO PAY MY EXPENSES. IF I GET GOOD REVIEWS, HE'LL BOOK ME SOME HEAVY DATES HERE. THEN THE BIG BUCKS? I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT IT ANYMORE. DON'T YOU WISH SOMEONE WOULD CARRY YOU OFF AND TAKE CARE OF YOU? THE ONLY GUYS WHO EVER CARRY ME OFF ARE WEARING TIGHTS AND EYE SHADOW. HAD ANY PROPOSALS LATELY? FRANK. HE LEFT A MESSAGE ON MY SERVICE. HOW ROMANTIC. HE'S PRESSING ME TO SET A DATE. YOU CERTAINLY SEEM EXCITED. IT'S A BIG DECISION. ALL THIS CAREER TALK MAKES ME HAVE TO PEE. HI. HELLO. LISTEN, UH, IS YOUR FRIEND COMING BACK? LISA? MMM-HMM. I'LL DO THIS FAST. DO WHAT? THERE'S NO REASON FOR YOU TO SAY YES. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. CAN YOU PRETEND TO KNOW ME SO I CAN MEET LISA? YEAH, WHY NOT? I SAW HER TONIGHT AT THE BALLET. SHE KNOCKED ME OUT. ALL OF A SUDDEN, HERE SHE WAS. HOW SHOULD WE DO IT? YOU GO BACK TO THE BAR. WHEN LISA COMES BACK, STROLL BY AND SAY, "HI, SUSAN." ARE YOU A DANCER? YOU BETTER GO. SHE'LL BE BACK SOON. I NEED YOUR NAME. SHE MIGHT CATCH ON IF I DON'T KNOW YOUR NAME. SAM CARPENTER. TELL HER WE MET ICE-SKATING. I'LL HANDLE IT. THAT DIDN'T TAKE LONG. I GOT NERVOUS. THERE WERE TWO WOMEN IN THERE PUTTING SOMETHING LIKE SWEET N LOW UP THEIR NOSES. EVEN IF YOU MARRY FRANK, WHY GIVE UP PLAYING? SUSAN, HI. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WHO ARE YOU? HUH? SHE'S NOT GOING TO BUY THIS. LISA, THIS IS SAM. HE WANTED TO MEET YOU. HE ICE-SKATES AND EVERYTHING. THIS IS MUCH BETTER THAN PRETENDING WE KNOW EACH OTHER. SHE'S CHARMED BY THE WHOLE THING. SIT DOWN, SAM. UH... ARE YOU USING THIS CHAIR? I KNEW YOU WOULD HIT IT OFF. I'VE GOT AN EARLY REHEARSAL. YOU'RE A MUSICIAN. TALK TO HER, NOT ME. I HAVE AN EARLY REHEARSAL MYSELF. YOU BOTH WANT A RIDE HOME? IT'S OK WITH ME. SURE. HERE, I'LL TAKE THAT. LEAVE A FAT TIP. WE'RE KNOWN AS BIG SPENDERS. MY LIMOUSINE'S RIGHT OUTSIDE... THE DOOR. HAS HE BEEN WITH YOU LONG? WHO? YOUR CHAUFFEUR, MARIO ANDRETTI. MUST BE HARD TO KEEP A GOOD ONE. HE KEEPS HIS CAR IMMACULATE. IT'S THE BUILDING RIGHT HERE. WHY DON'T THESE CABS HAVE SEAT BELTS? I'M WEARING ONE. HATE TO SEE YOU DRIVING AROUND WITHOUT ONE. I'LL SEE HER INSIDE. THERE'S BEEN UNPLEASANT THINGS HAPPENING TO WOMEN LATELY. TELL THE DOORMAN. HE'S BEEN DOING THEM. SEE YOU TOMORROW? HOW ABOUT A MOVIE? I'LL CALL YOU. GOOD, HE'S ASLEEP. YOU CAN GO NOW. THANK YOU. AH, LISTEN. I'M SORRY. ABOUT WHAT? THAT THING WITH LISA. PLEASE DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. DAMN ELEVATOR'S STUCK AGAIN. ANYTHING I CAN DO? CAN YOU REPAIR AN ELEVATOR? NO. THEN THERE'S NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO. WELL, NICE MEETING YOU. NICE TO MEET YOU. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. NIGHT. WONDERFUL. YES? LET ME HELP YOU. I CAN DO IT. I'D LIKE TO, OK? IT'S HARD WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE RAILING TO HOLD ON TO. I THOUGHT YOU WERE JUST GOING TO HELP. THIS IS EASIER. WHAT FLOOR? 37. I'M JUST KIDDING. 3. THAT'S NICE PERFUME YOU'RE WEARING. IT'S POLO, BY RALPH LAUREN. I THOUGHT IT SAID POLIO. THAT'S WHY I BOUGHT IT. AM I TOO HEAVY? NO, YOU'RE FINE. IS THAT WHAT IT WAS, POLIO? IT WAS VIRAL ENCEPHALITIS. PEOPLE THINK I'M TALKING ABOUT A ROMANIAN TENNIS PLAYER, SO I JUST SAY POLIO. IT SAVES A LOT OF CONFUSION. THANKS FOR THE LIFT. YOUR METER'S RUNNING, AND MY PHONE'S RINGING. YEAH, ALL RIGHT. WELL... WELL, GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. HI, MOM. IT'S JACK. AM I INTERRUPTING ANYTHING? UNFORTUNATELY, NO. I WAS JUST COMING IN. IT'S AFTER 1:00. AREN'T YOU A LITTLE LATE? DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. MY MOTHER WOULD RESENT YOU MOVING IN ON HER TERRITORY. THAT WAS MY REASON FOR CALLING. SHE CALLED EARLIER. SHE SAID DON'T FORGET DINNER TOMORROW. HOW COULD I? SHE SAID YOU FORGOT LAST SUNDAY. LAST SUNDAY WAS A BAD DAY. TOMORROW'S MY DAY OFF. DO YOU WANT TO HAVE LUNCH? I'M SERIOUSLY THINKING OF GETTING MARRIED. I'M NOT AGAINST MARRIAGE. I MEANT TO SOMEBODY ELSE. I JUST HAVE TO MEET YOU. I HAVE THIS MENTAL PICTURE OF YOU. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M RIGHT. YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE WAY OFF. BROWN HAIR, RIGHT? BIG BROWN EYES. LAUGH LINES IN THE CORNER. I'VE GOT ONE EYE RIGHT ON MY FOREHEAD. BUT IT'S BROWN, RIGHT? JACK. YOU KNOW THAT RESTAURANT YOU ALWAYS EAT AT, 555-3131? CHARLY'S? I'LL BE THERE TOMORROW BETWEEN 12:00 AND 1:00. I'LL BE WEARING A RED TIE. I CAN'T MAKE IT TOMORROW. GREAT. I WON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE THERE. GOOD NIGHT, JACK. WHY DID YOU WANT TO COME HERE? THE MOVIE'S ACROSS TOWN. I HAD A CRAVING FOR THEIR TUNA SALAD. NO PLACE MAKES IT LIKE THEY DO. SO HOW DID IT GO WITH SAM? WE WENT BACK TO MY PLACE AND PLAYED KISSY FACE FOR FIVE MINUTES. THEN HE SAID GOOD-BYE AND LEFT. MUST BE A CHEST MAN. WHAT? I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR HIM. YOU DON'T THINK HE'S TURNED OFF JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE-- BUILT LIKE A BOY? I THINK HE'S INTERESTED IN YOU. ME? HE KEPT ASKING ME ABOUT YOU. REALLY? UH-HUH. THERE GOES A VERY ATTRACTIVE YOUNG MAN. WHO? THEY GUY WITH THE RED TIE. WAS HE? YOU CAN GO RIGHT IN, MISS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAND IN LINE. WHY NOT? I DON'T MIND. ARE YOU CRAZY? IT'S THEATER POLICY. YOU'VE GOT TO GO IN NOW. BUT I DON'T WANT TO. IF MY BOSS SAW YOU, I'D BE IN TROUBLE. COME ON. WAIT! SHE CAN'T COME UNLESS YOU NEED HER ASSISTANCE. WHAT IF SHE NEEDS MINE? BEG PARDON? SHE'S BLIND. OH, I'M SORRY... I, I DIDN'T, UH... CAN I HAVE YOUR TICKET? OH. OH, I'M SORRY. WHO'S THAT? YOU BUMPED INTO THE NICE THEATER MAN. OH, SORRY. LISTEN, THIS PICTURE HAS SUBTITLES. HOW WILL SHE-- I'LL READ THEM TO HER. WHAT? SHE'S HARD OF HEARING. DOES THIS FILM HAVE DANCING? I LOVE TO LISTEN TO DANCING. HELLO. THIS IS YOUR ANSWERING SERVICE. WHERE'S JACK? I DON'T KNOW. I JUST STARTED TODAY. BIG ED WILL BE BY AT MIDNIGHT. WHO? BIG ED. BIG ED? AREN'T YOU BAMBI? SUSAN BERLANGER. OH! HOLD ON. SAM CALLED. SAM? THIS IS SUSAN, RIGHT? YEAH. THEN SAM CALLED--TWICE. HE DIDN'T LEAVE A NUMBER. ANYTHING ELSE? SOMEONE'S AT THE DOOR. NO. THANKS. OH, MY GOD! GORILLA-GRAM FOR MISS SUSAN BERLANGER. THAT'S ME. COME ON IN. GO AHEAD. THESE ARE... THESE ARE FROM JACK. OH. ♪ I WANT A GORILLA JUST LIKE THE GORILLA ♪ ♪ THAT MARRIED DEAR OLD DAD ♪ ♪ A DEAR OLD-FASHIONED GIRL WITH HEART SO TRUE ♪ ♪ SHE'D NEVER THINK OF BITING YOU...♪ YOU WANT TO HEAR THE REST? NO. IT WAS GOOD, THOUGH. ONE SECOND. YEAH, WELL, ANYWAY... WAIT A SECOND. THANK YOU. BUT WHY GET MARRIED? WHY NOT? YOU'RE ONLY TWO WEEKS AWAY FROM YOUR FIRST RECITAL TOUR. I'LL PUT IT OFF. RIGHT. I MEANT THE TOUR. YOU CAN'T PUT OFF THE TOUR. MR. SCHNEIDER HAS WORKED ON IT FOR MONTHS. YOU MAY NEVER GET ANOTHER CHANCE. SHE'S RIGHT, SUSAN. WHO IS THIS LUCKY MAN? FRANK BEDHAM. THE STOCKBROKER? HE WAS HERE FOR THANKSGIVING. WE'D BE MOVING TO TEXAS. ALL THE WAY DOWN THERE? WHAT IF... WHAT IF THINGS DON'T WORK OUT? WHY CAN'T YOU BE HAPPY FOR ME AND STOP WORRYING? I'M NOT 12. SHE SAID SHE WANTED TO BUY OIL STOCK. I REMEMBERED THAT RIGBY OIL WAS A GREAT BUY AT 28 BUCKS A SHARE. I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IT. SHE SAID, "ALL RIGHT, HONEY, I'LL TAKE HALF." I SAID, "YOU WANT TO BUY HALF A SHARE?" SHE SAID, "HELL NO, SUGAR, HALF THE COMPANY!" ANYBODY WHO SLINGS THE B.S. LIKE THAT WILL DO JUST FINE IN TEXAS. FRANK. WHAT? COME HERE. YOUR BOSS' FLY IS OPEN. YEAH, IT IS. SHOULDN'T YOU TELL HIM? ME? LOOK, MAYBE HE ALREADY KNOWS. HE'S JUST GOTTEN DIVORCED. MAYBE HE THINKS HE'S BEING SEXY. WHAT IF HE MAKES ANOTHER TOAST LIKE THAT AND SOMETHING POPS OUT? HI, EARL. I GUESS WE'RE GOING TO LOSE OUR BOY SOON. SUSAN MIGHT COME, TOO. THAT'S A MARVELOUS IDEA. HAS SHE SAID YES YET? NO. FRANK, HAND ME AN HORS D'OEUVRE. OH, YEAH, SURE. HERE YOU GO. FRANK! OH, EARL, I'M SORRY. LET ME HELP YOU. THERE WE GO. EARL IS VERY FOND OF YOU. IF HE ISN'T, HE SHOULD BE AFTER TONIGHT. THERE'S SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED. EVERY TIME I BRING IT UP, YOU CHANGE THE SUBJECT. WILL YOU MARRY ME OR NOT? I JUST WANT TO TAKE CARE OF YOU. BRAVO! BRAVO! BRAVO! THOSE WERE FOR YOU. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WOULD GO OUT WITH ME. I DON'T DO THAT. GO OUT? I'M NOT INTO THAT. ARE YOU INTO EATING? OCCASIONALLY. I WAS THINKING OF GOING TO CHARLY'S. IF YOU WERE THERE, TOO, EVEN AT THE SAME TABLE, IT WOULD BE COINCIDENCE, NOT LIKE GOING OUT. WHAT'S GOOD HERE? THE EARLY-BIRD SPECIAL. I WONDER WHAT THAT IS. WORMS, PROBABLY. I'M HAVING THE LOBSTER. LET'S BOTH HAVE THAT. SHELLFISH MAKES MY FACE SWELL UP LIKE A BALLOON. I HAD THIS COLLEGE ROOMMATE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. HE'D EAT SOMETHING AND GET ALL PUFFY. HIS FACE WOULD SWELL UP LIKE A-- LIKE A BALLOON. RIGHT. I'M GOING TO GO BEFORE I'M TEMPTED TO ASK YOU WHAT YOUR MAJOR IS. WESTERN HISTORY. WESTERN CIV? NO, I MEAN WESTERN HISTORY. THE STUDY OF THE OLD WEST. YOU CAN'T MAJOR IN THAT. YOU CAN AT UTAH STATE. YOU'RE FROM UTAH? NO, ACTUALLY, I JUST WENT TO SCHOOL THERE. I GREW UP IN VEGAS. NOBODY GROWS UP IN VEGAS. MY DAD WAS A BLACKJACK DEALER. MY MOM PLAYED THE ORGAN AT ONE OF THOSE CHEAP WEDDING CHAPELS. UH-HUH. THERE'S A STORY THAT MY MOTHER PLAYED AT HER OWN WEDDING. SHE PLAYED HERE COMES THE BRIDE AND THEN RACED DOWN THE AISLE. HOW DID IT GO WITH LISA? WELL... NOT TOO GREAT. I MEAN, LIKE YOU... YOU ORDER PRIME RIB, BUT WANT THE DUCK SOMEONE ELSE GETS. READY TO ORDER? I'LL HAVE THE DUCK. ME, TOO. SORRY. THAT'S OK. I CAN TAKE THIS OFF. I'LL TAKE THISOFF. YOU WANT ME TO GO OUT? NO, I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO OUT. IT COMES OFF EASY. SEE? IT'S OFF. OK. THIS ISN'T GOING TO WORK. WHY DON'T WE JUST FORGET IT? WHY? IT'S LIKE WHAT YOU SAID BEFORE-- PRIME RIB AND DUCK. BESIDES, I'M GETTING MARRIED SOON. MARRIED? YEAH. WHAT THE HELL WAS THIS ABOUT? IT WAS A TEST. EITHER I FLUNKED OR YOU FLUNKED. SOMEBODY FLUNKED. I'M SORRY. UH... OH. I TRIED CALLING, BUT THE PHONE WAS BUSY FOR HOURS. I GOT WORRIED. SILLY OF ME. FRANK? THIS IS SAM... UM... CARPENTER. RIGHT. THIS IS FRANK... BEDHAM. RIGHT. DO YOU LOVE THAT GUY? I HARDLY KNOW HIM. WHY DID YOU DO IT? IT JUST SEEMED LIKE THE RIGHT GUY AT THE WRONG TIME, I GUESS. IT'S OK. HEY, I REALIZE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL HAPPEN FROM TIME TO TIME. LOOK, THERE ARE LOTS OF MARRIED COUPLES THAT HAVE THEIR AFFAIRS, AND IT DOESN'T REALLY MEAN ANYTHING. LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP-- THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. NOT SEX. RIGHT? IF SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO SLEEP WITH SOME GUY-- OR YOU DO. OR I DO-- IT'LL BE OK. AS LONG AS IT'S NOT THE SAME FELLA, RIGHT? IT SOUNDED LIKE A GOOD SOLUTION FOR US. YOU REALLY THINK WE WOULD HAVE FOOLED ANYONE? YOU KNOW... IT'S JUST POSSIBLE THEY'LL ACCEPT YOU THE WAY YOU ARE DOWN THERE IN TEXAS. WE'LL FIND OUT WHEN I WALK INTO THE OFFICE WITH SOME COWBOY AND INTRODUCE HIM AS MY FIANCE. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU, TOO. I'VE DECIDED TO DO THAT EUROPEAN TOUR. WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND? DID YOU GO OUT WITH SAM? YEAH. HOW DID THAT GO? HAPPENS TO THE BEST OF US. JUST ONCE, I'D LIKE TO KNOW IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS A BAD CONVERSATIONALIST OR BECAUSE HE DIDN'T LIKE BROWN HAIR OR I HAD DOGGIE BREATH OR SOMETHING. YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY IMPERFECT PERSON IN THE WORLD. I USED TO STUFF KLEENEX IN HERE BEFORE DATES. THEN I'D WORRY ABOUT WHETHER THE GUY WOULD COP A FEEL. UNLESS THE GUY WAS DESPERATE TO BLOW HIS NOSE, I WAS IN TROUBLE. THIS IS MY STOP. CALL ME AND WE'LL TALK. PARDON. BUT, MADEMOISELLE, I DON'T UNDERSTAND. LET ME FINISH TALKING, OR I'M GOING TO CAVE RIGHT IN. THERE'S A HOTEL IN MEGEVE. I'VE GOT RESERVATIONS THERE. I'VE GOT ENOUGH MONEY TO COVER MYSELF FOR A WEEK. THAT'S A SKI RESORT. THAT'S WHY I PICKED IT. IT'S A GREAT PLACE, RIGHT? OH, YES, IT'S VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND. IF YOU HELP ME WITH THIS, I CAN BE LIKE OTHER PEOPLE THERE. AND THAT'S WHY THIS WAS SUCH A GOOD IDEA, BUT IT'S JUST NOT SOUNDING SO GOOD RIGHT NOW. OK. I'M FINISHED. YOU CAN TALK NOW. WELL, THIS IS NOT VERY... ORTHODOX, WHAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING. YOU MAY BE TAKING A BIG EMOTIONAL RISK. AS A DOCTOR, I DO NOT REALLY APPROVE OF THIS. OK, THANK YOU. BUT AS A FRENCHMAN, I MUST CONGRATULATE YOU ON AN INGENIOUS IDEA. THEN YOU'LL DO IT? OF COURSE, WITH PLEASURE. I'M AFRAID I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CANCEL THE AMSTERDAM RECITAL. WELL, UH... I'M HAVING MY APPENDIX OUT. NO, NO, NO. I'LL BE FINE. IT'S JUST THAT OBVIOUSLY I'LL HAVE TO CANCEL AMSTERDAM AND ROME. NO, DON'T CALL DADDY. I'LL DO THAT. I DON'T WANT HIM TO WORRY. OF COURSE I'LL LET YOU KNOW. I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I GET BACK. JE PEUX VOUS AIDER, MADEMOISELLE? NO. I'VE GOT IT. I ALMOST DIDN'T COME DOWN TO MEET YOU. THE TRAIN WAS LATE LEAVING PARIS.

IF YOU DON'T WANT THE ROOM-- I WANT THE ROOM. IT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM. NEVER MIND. THERE IS A BIT OF DIFFICULTY. WHAT KIND OF DIFFICULTY? THE YOUNG LADY WHO HAD YOUR ROOM BEFORE DOES NOT WISH TO MOVE OUT. SHE HAS TO MOVE OUT. I HAD THE RESERVATION. IT SAYS RIGHT THERE-- BERLANGER. PLAIN AS DAY. I AM VERY SORRY.

HE'LL BE AT THE RACE. HOW DO YOU KNOW? I ASKED HIM. YOU COULD HAVE FUN TOGETHER. HE'S ALONE. AND I'M ALONE. EXACTLY. THIS IS GREAT STUFF. THANK YOU. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT FIND IT INTERESTING.

HOW WOULD YOU FEEL GOING DOWN THIS MOUNTAIN ON ONE SKI? NERVOUS. OK. NOBODY ELSE HAS MADE IT. THANKS FOR TELLING ME. YOU ONLY HAVE TO FINISH. FORGET SPEED. JUST GET THROUGH IT AND YOU'VE WON. WHO CARES ABOUT WINNING? I WANT TO GET THROUGH IT. THAT'S WHAT I JUST SAID. I WON'T MAKE IT. YES, YOU WILL. GO SLOW. SLOW? AS SLOW AS YOU WANT. IF YOU FALL DOWN, YOU'RE DISQUALIFIED. REMEMBER, SLOW.

WHY ARE YOU TAKING PICTURES OF THIS WHEN THERE'S A REAL RACE GOING ON? WHO SAID THIS WASN'T A REAL RACE? YEAH, WHO SAID? AND BESIDES, I WON IT. SO GET YOUR ASS OUT OF HERE SO I CAN GET MY PICTURE TAKEN. SORRY. IT'S OK. MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO AFTER HER. I DON'T THINK SO. WHY DON'T WE ALL GO UP AND WATCH THE REST OF THE RACES? IT'S THE FINALS. I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT THE CROWDS. WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT CROWDS? WHEN I SAID "GO UP," I MEANT... GO UP. HOW HIGH WILL THIS THING GO? WELL, UH... THE ALTITUDE RECORD IN A BALLOON IS JUST OVER 53,000 FEET. LET'S GO FOR IT! YOU'RE JOKING. THAT'S WITH OXYGEN TANKS. WE DON'T HAVE OXYGEN TANKS. I WANT TO GO FOR SOMETHING! I WANT TO DO THINGS I'VE NEVER DONE. LIKE WHAT? I DON'T KNOW. I HAVEN'T DONE A LOT. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO SWITZERLAND? NO. LET'S GO! HOW FAR IS IT? ABOUT 10 KILOMETERS, OVER THAT MOUNTAIN. WE'VE GOT TO TRY FOR IT. OK. I WAS SO SCARED. I THOUGHT I'D GET SICK. I'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING DANGEROUS LIKE THIS. YOU KNOW? I FEEL SO... ALIVE? ALIVE. HMM. YEAH. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE FEELING. NO, YOU DON'T. THANKS FOR TODAY. YOU'RE WELCOME. AND TONIGHT. I HAD A WONDERFUL TIME. I'D INVITE YOU IN, BUT NICOLE... THAT'S OK. THAT'S OK. LOOK, SUSAN... WHAT I DO TAKES ME ALL OVER THE PLACE. I'LL BE HERE A FEW DAYS, AND THEN NEXT WEEK IT'S AFRICA, AND THEN MAYBE AUSTRALIA. WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS? I MOVE AROUND A LOT. I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME FOR INVOLVEMENTS. OH. NEITHER DO I. I TRAVEL A LOT, TOO. I NEVER KNOW WHERE I'LL BE NEXT. THEN YOU KNOW HOW IT IS. YEAH. WELL, GREAT. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. LA MEME CHOSE. HOW LONG DO YOU PLAN TO STAND IN THE DARK? I WAS JUST THINKING. ARE YOU ALONE? OF COURSE I AM ALONE. BECAUSE... I THOUGHT MAYBE... YOU THOUGHT MAYBE WHAT? I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU AND FRANCOIS... ISN'T HE A NICE GUY? YES. HE'S SO ATTRACTIVE, INTELLIGENT, AND WITTY. HE'S GOT EVERYTHING. EXCEPT TWO LEGS. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? I DIDN'T THINK IT MATTERED. YOU DIDN'T? YOU COULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING TO ME SO I'D BE PREPARED. PREPARED FOR WHAT? I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS BOTHERS YOU. IT DOESN'T BOTHER HIM. OK. SO IT'S MY PROBLEM, NOT HIS. I'M SORRY. I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU. UNUSUAL GIRL. DEFINITELY UNUSUAL. THEN WHY ARE YOU DOWN HERE? I DON'T NEED PROBLEMS. HA! ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH DEJA VU? SURE. WHY? SUSAN SAID THOSE WORDS TO ME THE OTHER NIGHT... ABOUT YOU. WELL, MAYBE WE'RE BOTH RIGHT. WHO NEEDS PROBLEMS? OH, CATCH ME! I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT OLYMPICS! HEY! AAH! HA HA! YOU TWO-LEGGED GUYS SURE ARE KLUTZY. SKIING IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A CONTACT SPORT. AT LEAST NOT ON THE SLOPES. YOU OK? WAIT A MINUTE. I HURT MY WRIST. OH. LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE IT BETTER. MY LIP HURTS, TOO. MMM. THERE. IN FACT, I'M HURTING ALL OVER. OH. THAT FEELS SO GOOD. WHAT I LIKE BEST ABOUT SKIING IS TAKING OFF MY BOOTS AFTERWARDS. SKI BOOTS CAN BE BETTER THAN SEX. BAD SEX. THERE IS A SAYING. "GOOD SEX IS GREAT. "BAD SEX IS, UH... STILL PRETTY GOOD." OH! WHY DON'T I ASK THE COOK TO MAKE US SOME FONDUE. NO. ANOTHER TIME, THANK YOU. SUSAN AND I HAVE TO GO. THERE'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF. YEAH. SO, UM... WE HAVE ANOTHER ENGAGEMENT. THAT WAS MUCH BETTER THAN FONDUE. EVEN BETTER THAN TAKING OFF MY SKI BOOTS. WHOO! YOUR CAST IS COLD. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY-- "COLD CAST, WARM HEART." NOT BAD. THANK YOU. I WANT TO SEE UNDER YOUR CAST. IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY! IT'S THE ONLY PART OF YOU I CAN'T SEE. SORRY. I GOTTA SEE IT. PLEASE? I'M SAVING IT FOR SOMEONE SPECIAL. YOU WHAT? I NEVER PLANNED ON THIS. HE WAS THE LAST GUY IN THE WORLD... LISA, WHAT AM I GONNA DO? TELL HIM! I CAN'T DO THAT. WHAT IF SOMEONE SPRANG THIS ON YOU? THERE ISN'T ANYONE WHO ISN'T HIDING SOMETHING. LISA! THIS IS MAJOR! THIS ISN'T STUFFING MY BRA WITH KLEENEX. WHAT AM I DOING? I'M LEAVING IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. SO WHY TELL HIM AND RUIN IT? WHY RUIN A COUPLE DAYS' HAPPINESS WHEN IT'S YOUR LIFE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT? YOU LOVE THIS GUY? I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M BOTHERING YOU. IT SEEMS TO ME YOU HAVE A CHOICE. EITHER YOU TELL HIM, OR YOU MAKE SURE YOU NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN. EVER. THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED. I'M SORRY I WOKE YOU. I GOTTA GO. BYE. CLAUDE CALLED. OH, HE DID? HE WANTS ME TO COME BACK. CAN YOU GIVE ME THAT, PLEASE? THANK YOU. WHAT ABOUT FRANCOIS? HE DESERVES SOMEBODY BETTER THAN ME. LOOK. HE'S A TERRIFIC MAN. I TOLD YOU, IT'S MY PROBLEM, NOT HIS. YOU'RE UNDERESTIMATING YOURSELF, NICOLE. YOU GIVE ME TOO MUCH CREDIT. OUI. CES DEUX LA. MERCI. KISS PETER GOOD-BYE FOR ME. I WILL. HAPPY DAYS. RIGHT. I'M SORRY, FRANCOIS. ABOUT WHAT? I JUST FEEL RESPONSIBLE. DON'T. I'VE ADJUSTED. I'M FINE. YOU SURE? I'M SURE. I HAVE TO LEAVE IN THE MORNING. I'M FLYING TO ZURICH ON BUSINESS. IT'S ALL OVER, ISN'T IT? YOU'RE GOING. NICOLE'S GONE. PETER IS HERE. THAT'S ANOTHER STORY. THERE'S SOMETHING I HAVEN'T TOLD ANYBODY. I MEANT HE'S HERE. RIGHT NOW. WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE THE GOLDEN COACH IS ABOUT TO TURN INTO A PUMPKIN. WHAT? THE MOMENT OF TRUTH IS ABOUT TO ARRIVE. IT SURE LOOKS GRIM AROUND HERE. WHAT'S UP? I HAVE TO LEAVE TOMORROW. LET'S LIVE IT UP TONIGHT. THE FOREIGN PRESS HAVE TAKEN OVER THIS RESTAURANT IN ST. GERVAIS. WE'LL GO DOWN THERE. WE'LL SHAKE IT UP. NICOLE WENT BACK TO PARIS THIS MORNING. WE'LL FIND SOMEBODY ELSE SO YOU CAN HAVE FUN. DON'T LEAVE ON A DOWN NOTE. WHY NOT? MAYBE HE WANTS TO BE DOWN. WHY DOES EVERYTHING HAVE TO BE HAPPY? MAYBE HE ISN'T HAPPY. MAYBE I'M NOT, EITHER! WHY IS SHE MAD AT ME? SHE LOST ME WHEN SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT PUMPKINS. I'D LIKE TO GO WITH YOU, BUT I CAN'T. WELL, I GUESS THIS IS, UH... AU REVOIR. I EXPECT WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN. I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED. AS FOR YOU... FRANCOIS. I WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS. GIVE HER SOME TIME, AND THEN CALL HER. I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR. FAIR? YOU CAN'T MAKE PEOPLE BE MORE THAN THEY ARE. I GUESS I KNOW THAT. WHAT'S THIS THING? IT'S FOR GETTING TO ST. GERVAIS. LET'S TAKE A TAXI. THEY'RE NOT RUNNING. GET ON! IT'LL BE FUN. ISN'T THIS GREAT? IT'S OK. CAN WE PULL OVER FOR A MINUTE? WHAT'S UP? THERE'S SOMETHING I HAVE TO TELL YOU. OH, MY GOD. YOU'RE PREGNANT ALREADY. NO. I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU BEFORE. LET'S PLAY NOW. WE'LL TALK LATER, OK? PETER! I'M NOT THE PERFECT PERSON YOU THINK I AM. PERFECT? YOU'RE SKINNY, YOU GOT A BUSTED ANKLE-- IT'S MORE THAN THAT! I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING! WHAT? I'VE GOT THIS... THERE'S A GUY AT HOME. AND... HE'S ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM. I TOLD HIM I NEEDED TIME TO THINK. AND WHAT I'VE DECIDED IS, I'M GOING TO DO IT. YOU'RE GOING TO... YOU MEAN, ALL THE WHILE WE WERE... YOU WERE-- YEAH. WELL, THAT'S... THAT'S JUST GREAT. YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T HAVE TIME FOR PERMANENT RELATIONSHIPS, REMEMBER? YEAH. RIGHT. PETER! PETER! I WANT TO GET OFF! PLEASE STOP, PETER! I WANT TO GET OFF! THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID! IF YOU DON'T STOP, I'LL JUMP. SURE. NO, I'M GONNA! AAH! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? IF YOU'RE TRYING TO KILL YOURSELF, DON'T INCLUDE ME IN YOUR PLANS! YOU'RE OUT! FINE! WHERE ARE YOU GOING? BACK! DON'T BE STUPID. I'LL GIVE YOU A RIDE. I'D LIKE TO GET THERE ALIVE. WELL, ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT! OU VOUS ALLEZ? GOOD QUESTION. PARDON? HELLO, MR. SCHNEIDER? IT'S SUSAN BERLANGER. I'M CALLING BECAUSE I'M FEELING BETTER. YOU WHAT? THE REVIEWS FROM PARIS? I'M SORRY. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOU. I THOUGHT YOU SAID-- THEY DID? YOU'RE KIDDING! I DON'T BELIEVE IT! I REALIZE THAT AMSTERDAM IS OFF, BUT WHAT ABOUT ROME? CINCINNATI? OH, OK. WELL, WHEN? IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS? YEAH, THAT'S FINE. I'LL DEFINITELY BE THERE. THANK YOU, MR. SCHNEIDER. BYE-BYE. CINCINNATI INSTEAD OF ROME. GOD IS GETTING ME FOR THIS. YOU THINK YOU COULD MOVE IT A LITTLE FASTER, MISS? I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN, OK? I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU. I'M WONDERING IF YOU'D BELIEVE THAT THESE THINGS ARE THE RAGE IN PARIS. OUR TRAIN IS LEAVING. I KNOW. ALL MY BAGS ARE ON IT. MINE, TOO.
