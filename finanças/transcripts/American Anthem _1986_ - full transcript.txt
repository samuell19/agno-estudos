[Grunts] Come on! Stick! Yeah! Come on, Becky! Go, Becky! Becky, nail it! Yeah! Come on, Tracy. You're doing good. Oops. It's ok. Go for it again. Release! Good, good, good, good. Julie Lloyd. Hi. I'm Becky. Julie Lloyd. Heard lots about you. Hi. Welcome to the club. How was your flight? Julie: It was fine. And your parents, how do they feel? They're ok. They've accepted my coming here. Good, good. Just get settled this weekend. Here is the music for your floor routine. Danielle with help you with the choreography. We start Monday. Does the coach pick everyone's music? Uh-huh. I've never had anybody pick my music before. You never had a coach like soranhoff. Come on, I'll show you around. [Loud synthesizer music playing] [Knocking] I don't want any! [Knock knock knock] I gave at the office! [Knock knock knock] I'm an atheist! [Turns power off] What?! Julie. How are you doing, cousin? Ok. Both: How long has it been? 2 years? 1 year. A long time. Come in. Ok. [Plays a few notes] [Heavy footsteps] [Music playing on car stereo] Hey, listen to this. Did I get the right tape? [Music stops] [Whimsical orchestral music plays] [Giggling] I'm not gonna be able to do it to this. You know, coach knows what he's doing. You can bet there's a reason for this stuff. I don't know. I guess this place is a lot different than park Avenue, huh? You're used to having your own way. It's not that. It's just hard for me to accept things blindly. Maybe I'm a little scared. You think your parents will be coming out to see you? That'll be a first. My father's too busy. My mother doesn't care. They don't know what's important to me. [Rock music playing] Hi, Steve. Hey, man. * and we all just need the same things * * I'll tell you what I know * * we're headin'...* see you guys in a minute. * in the same direction * * so never let it go * hi. Hello. I saw you at the gym today. You were there? Yeah. Well, I was just watching. Oh. My name's Steve. Julie. Well, I have to go find my friend. All right. I'll see you around. Ok. * ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah * * you see it * * see it * who is he? What's his story? Becky: He used to be a big deal around here, a football hero. But something happened, and he gave it all up. How do you know him? He was on the team for awhile. He's really a great gymnast, but he's not doing much anymore. So how's the arm? It's good. Watch yourself on your bike, will ya? Yeah. So what's the final word on school? You going? No. How about the gym? So how long's your old man been laid off now? Almost a year, isn't it? Look, he's doing the best he can. It's not easy for him to pick up a new skill, ok? Yeah, and I bet it's a real picnic, both of you at home, just sorta kicking around, nothing to do. What are you getting at? Listen, Einstein, I want you to get off your ass. The cast if off now. Man, do something with your time. Don't throw it away like you did the football scholarship. You don't know what you're talking about. Oh, yeah? Then how come you're not in school right now playing ball? Too much pressure? Afraid you couldn't keep pulling it off? Or is it just 'cause your old man stopped being there for you and you just couldn't make it on your own? Man, it's time you stop pissing your talents away. The team could use you. Over the coming months, there will be a series of meets to determine who will qualify to go to the usa championships in Phoenix. The top competitors there will form the team that will represent the United States at the world championships in Rotterdam next November. This morning... I was chosen to be the coach of that team. [Cheering and applause] Over the next few months, those of you who qualify will go to Phoenix and compete against 100 of the best gymnasts in the country. The top 20 there will comprise our national team, but only 6 women and 6 men will go to Rotterdam. All of you have the potential to be on our national team. After that, only you can decide. We are here to help you. Any questions? Ok. Let's go. [Motorcycle approaching] Maybe your father can learn how to make his own meals. I gotta get back to work. Well, I'll cook for him. I'm the gourmet in the family anyways. You all right? Yeah. Don't worry. I'll watch it. Ok. See you. [Engine grinds] I'm all right. [Engine grinds] Your boss called. Wanted to know if you felt better. Said you called in sick this morning. Where were you? I was at the gym. You didn't want to go to school, so you took a job. They count on you down there. Live up to it! At least I've got a job. You got nothing! Just like me! You got nothing! You had an opportunity and you blew it! You gave up! I gave up? What about you? Come back here! You hear me? I'm talking to you! Just leave me alone! Just play out in the back for a while, huh, Mikey? [Crowd cheering] Announcer: It's late in the fourth quarter. The game is still tied. Longacre takes the snap. He's back to pass. Tevere is in the flat. He's in the clear. Tevere has got it. [Breathing heavily] Announcer: Touchdown tevere! [Whistle blows] [Thump] [Thump] [Thump] I'm gonna need the rest of the week to recover. Well, you got until tomorrow. Wonderful. Hi. Hi. Can I give you a ride? Sure. I'll see you later. Steve: So, where you from? Julie: New York. You like the gym? Yeah. It's just a bigger deal than I thought it was gonna be. Everybody's so damn good. Yup. I know that feeling. * people say I'm crazy * * just a fool * * well, I'm the pigeon * * and, baby, you're the stool * Julie: I heard you used to be a pretty good gymnast. Thinking about coming back? Steve: Nah. I got a job. I work at Jake's, building motorcycles. Did you leave anybody behind? What? Do you have a boyfriend? No. You want one? * take it easy * * there ain't no one else * * don't give me reasons * * and I won't ask for nothing * * take it easy * * on yourself * * take it easy * * there ain't no one else * * don't give me reasons * Straighten your line. Good. Girl: All right, Becky! Whoo! Girl: Whoo, looking hot, Becky! Second girl: Way to go, Becky! Girl: Keep it up, Becky! Girl: Yeah, Becky, stick it! Good. Ok, Julie. Girl: All right, Julie, let's see it. Go for it, Julie. Right. [Whimsical orchestral music plays] Julie. Mark the end position. Try it again. [Music begins again] Girl: Come on, Julie. Do it again. Hold it! Danielle! Julie. Go work on the tumbling mats and do each move in slow motion. And when you think you've got it perfect, we'll try it again. Hey. Today was no big deal. Happens to everybody. First time for me. You're going about it all wrong. Just concentrate on the routine. You gotta make the commitment. Even if it doesn't make sense to me? Yeah. We're all stuck with the rules. Becky. My floor routine could use some help, and I want to work on it before the meet. I'm here every Sunday afternoon. If you want to work, come on by. It's up to you. I'll be here. [Rock synthesizer music playing] Can you make a tape of that? Sure. Why? Just want to fool around with it. Listen, Arthur. I'm really sorry about the way things were handled after the accident. We should have come out. We were hoping you would come to New York. You know what bugged me the most after the funeral? Was that you guys didn't have a clue how to deal with me. You all stopped looking me in the eye. So I decided to stay here. It's not bad. Insurance is cool. Things have a way of working out. You can't stay in this room forever, Arthur. [Horn honks] That's Steve. I've got to go. Don't be a stranger. What's wrong? He was in a car accident with his parents. They didn't make it. I'm really glad you're here. Mr. Tevere: What do you want from me, huh?! Tell me! I'm just sick of it! There's plenty of work you can do around here to help me out! I work all day, and then I've gotta come home and clean all night, and I just don't think it's fair. Just once I'd like to come home and be able to relax. And where have you been? Just riding around. Why didn't you call? I asked you a question. Leave me alone. Stop it, please! Stopped! Go ahead. Break it again. Steve: My father and I had another talk. What do you mean? I don't know. All we end up doing is slugging one another. Steve, if there's a problem, why don't you just get out of there? Can't do that. The guy still means a lot to me. Ever since I was a kid, he was always there. I screwed up, Julie. I turned down a 4-year football scholarship. Did you know that? Just let it go. I didn't even give a shit. Did you really want it? Well, it was-- my last year in high school was a joke. My father had just lost his job from this place. Really screwed me up. [Bird wings flapping] I guess I let a lot of people down. Who, your family? My father. You gotta pull it together for yourself now, Steve. Pull it together for yourself. [Door closes] I'm sorry. I was with Steve. I thought you wanted to work out today, but I guess you don't need my help. Good luck at the meet. Look, I said I'm sorry. It's something I had to do, ok? You tell me. [Whistling] Hey, coach. I was at the gym last night. The team's looking pretty good. Kirk is getting better and better. I want to come back, val. I think the team could use me. It'd be good for me, too. You were here before. This time's different. If I start right away, I can make it by the next meet. There's something you want badly. Are you sure you know what it is? Just give me a chance. Work on your compulsories. After the meet, we'll know soon enough. [Crowd cheering] Hey, dad. Got something for you. What's on your mind? I need you to lower my rent. I want to work less hours. I'm going back to the gym. No. That's not our agreement. If you're not gonna go to school, I want you to work. Look, just because I'm not going to school, doesn't mean I'm not going anywhere. Why can't you just support me on this one like everybody else is? Because they don't have to live with your mistakes. Ok, you're up. [Arthur's synthesizer music plays] Go back to the top. Steady it. Kirk, spot him on the cross. [Music starts] Damn. Carol, can we go back to the top, please? Stop it, Julie. Stick to the routine. Danielle, give her the choreography. Come on, concentrate. We haven't got all day. I knew he wasn't gonna like it. What's his problem? I was just trying something out. Where's the other tape? Announcer: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of the United States gymnastics federation and the tops gymnastics club, we'd like to welcome you to the southern regional competition. I'd also like to remind you that all of the gymnasts here today are vying for positions on the national team, where the final selection will be made at the upcoming usa championships in Phoenix, Arizona. Yeah, Steve! Man: Ok, Mr. Football, let's go. Bring it home. Man: Go, Steve! Yeah, man, yeah! Man: Go for it, Steve! Yeah, all right! Man: Go get 'em, Steve! Yeah, Steve! Soranhoff: You are trying too hard. This is just practice for you. Dumb. Announcer: Men's floor. Steve tevere. 9.25. Would you look at that, coach? I'm better than that. Forget about the numbers. You're doing ok. Announcer: In sixth position, Ron Haley, Dean Roberts, Bobby Cole, mace Randolph, and in tenth position Steve tevere. Gotta get up there. Sit down, Jack-in-the-box. You've been out 6 months, asshole. Announcer: Now, in the final women's event, Julie Lloyd from the tops. [Whimsical orchestral music plays] The first competitor in the men's horizontal bar competition. Danny squire from Crawford academy. Oh, good. The pussy from poughkeepsie. [Applause] Announcer: Danny squire, ladies and gentlemen. Danny squire from Crawford academy. A powerful routine. A good example of why he's number 3 in the country. That was my worst event. You're right. No better than a 9.3. Announcer: Women's floor. Julie Lloyd, 9.30. We are on the same team, aren't we? Not when you do your floor with that attitude. You're bringing US all down. You know, I can't say much for your attitude, either. At least I don't bring it out on the floor with me. Danielle: This music just isn't working for her. Maybe we ought to change it. No. That's not the problem. Look at her. She's a scared rabbit, and I want a lion. The next competitor on the horizontal bar, unranked nationally, Steve tevere. Go get 'em, tiger. Come on, you can do it! What do I need? That's not important. Come on. You told kirk. That's different. Well, you used to tell me. Come on. Just do your best. Man: Come on, Steve! You can do it, man! Man: Go for it, flagstaff! [Crowd cheering] Oh, my god. No. Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, please stay in your seats. Please stay in your seats. Trainers and medical personnel have the situation under control. Steve tevere has fallen. It looked like Steve was attempting a tripus dismount. A difficult move... [Thunder] Hut, hut. Hut, hut. Do something! I want you ready! Ready! I'm out here! Where are you? Now, now, you hear me?! What do you want from me? Where are you for me? [Bone breaks] If you ever pull a stunt like you did Saturday night, you can find yourself another coach. Ok? Now let's go. You thought all you had to do was show up, and this would be a piece of cake. You have to start from the beginning. It's going to be a tremendous fight. So what's going on, dad? You awake? It's not going too well. Trying. It's just not the same. You used to be at every game. I'd see you there. Then you'd give me that look. The look I needed. We were together, man. We used to be a team. It's too bad you're not listening. It's too bad I don't have the guts to tell you when you are. * I see myself * * locked in her arms * * she looks inside my soul * * she is much too beautiful * * to ever let go * * time * * it passes much too fast * * and time * * I want to make it last * * ooh * * ooh * * I run to her * * I run * * to her * * yesterday's * * been a dream * * she came into my life * * the sun was shinin' brightly * * as we talked into the night * * time * * oh, it passes much too fast * * time * * now I want to make it last * * oh * * oh * * I run to her * * I run * * run to her * * oh oh oh oh oh * Mr. Tevere: Why aren't you working? I want your rent now! Steve: Lay off! I'll give it to you when I'm ready! He doesn't give a damn about the money. Are you listening to me? Just leave me alone, mom. Leave you alone? Come here. I want to show you something. Why couldn't he just tell me he cares? Why can't you tell him? He goes to bed every night worried about you. He thinks he let you down. He hasn't let me down. It's just the opposite. Why? Because you're not a big school hero anymore? Talk to him, Steve. You don't have to be a star for him. Just be a son. [Arthur's synthesizer music plays] Wow. What? What? What? What? What? What? What? [Music stops] Something wrong? Not bad. So what do you think? Are you gonna use it? Are you kidding? I love it. There's still something missing. I just need a little more time. Ok. Listen, I'll see you later. I have something to do, ok? I want you to listen to this. I want to use it. No. Unless you perform perfectly, the judges, they'd cut you to ribbons. Keep working on the other piece. Make it better. I don't feel it. It's never gonna be great. That's up to you, isn't it? The music is not the obstacle. Stop this nonsense. Work on the other piece. You've been in here all day. You gonna be in here all night, too? You still don't get it, do you? Losing your job. Steve's arm. You're just using them as excuses to hide from US. I got 2 kids who could give a damn, job or no job, you know? What they really need is their old man. Especially Steve. You two had a good thing going. Then it fell apart. He's doing something he really cares about now. He's going to be ok. You're either with him or you're not, honey. [Thunder] Mr. Tevere: You got nothing! Just like me! Nothing! Soranhoff: If you ever pull a stunt like you did Saturday night, you can find yourself another coach. Kirk: No one's ever done a tripus before. Soranhoff: Dumb. Julie: You have to pull it together for yourself now, Steve. You have to pull it together for yourself. Mr. Tevere: Nothing! You had an opportunity, and you blew it! You gave up! Soranhoff: There's something you want badly. Are you sure you know what it is? Are you sure you know what it is? Shit! Mr. Tevere: Nothing! Soranhoff: If you're not going to do it right, don't do it at all. Soranhoff: No! Mr. Tevere: You had an opportunity, and you blew it! You gave up! Gave up! Ooh! Damn it! [Thunder] Kirk: Get it together or get off this team. Mrs. Tevere: You don't have to be a star for him. Just be a son. A son! A son! Kirk: No one's ever done a tripus before. No one's ever done a tripus before. Soranhoff: No! Oomph! Mrs. Tevere: You don't have to be a star for him. Just be a son. You don't have to be a star for him. Just be a son. [Telephone rings] [Playing synthesizer] [Ring] Aah! Arthur? Yes. Listen, I was thinking. What's the occasion? What? Never mind. Maybe using the music is not such a great idea. I think I need more time with it. No. I saw you do it. It's terrific. You'll be great. Besides, I'm really looking forward to it. Good night, Julie. So you tomorrow in Phoenix. [Dial tone] [Knock on door] [Knocking] What happened to you? I want to stay here tonight. You can't. We got a bus to catch in the morning. No, you do. I quit. Why did you do that? Because I don't need it anymore. I've been doing it all for the wrong reasons. I've got nothing to prove. Bullshit. If you quit now, you'll just be a loser. First it's a scholarship, now it's this. What's next, me? Steve, whenever anything starts to get heavy, all you know how to do is run. You don't get it, do you? You've been here, what? 10, 11 weeks now? You think you know everything. Man, you don't know shit. You bastard. I'm going to Phoenix, and you come over here now and tell me I don't know what I'm doing? Get the hell out of here! Why'd you come back to the gym in the first place? I don't know. I guess I wanted to love it. Well, don't you? Steve: Mom! What's wrong, Mikey? Where's ma going? Shit. What's going on? None of your business! Get the hell out of here! Do you hear me?! Get the hell out of here now! Steve! Get the fuck out of here! Where'd she go?! [Atv motor running] Michael! Mikey! Mikey, come back! No, Mikey, get back! Steve: No! Mikey! [Dog barking] Steve! Steve, help me! Hold on, Mikey! Steve! I gotcha. Come on now. Ok. I'm sorry, Mikey. I'm really sorry. You shouldn't have told dad to leave. Why can't we just be a family? What do you want from me? I just want you to be what you used to be. Do you know where he's at? No, sir. Do you? Ok, let's go. Where have you been? Just driving around, like somebody else I know. Mikey: Mom! [Running] You ok? Yeah. Your father and I have some talking to do. I'm going to the trials. It would be nice if you could all make it. Woman on P.A.: Chris aldrin, please go to the white courtesy phone. Chris aldrin, please go to the white courtesy phone. Have you pushed your knee too far? I'll be ok.
