Quickly now! Come on everybody! Help me pull the rope! Come on hurry up! Quick! Morgan! Morgan, what's happening? Answer me! Morgan! Morgan! Have some water. I'm sorry I just had a terrible dream. Thank god, I thought you were having a fit or something. Philip asked me to come here and find out how you are doing with your research. He can't come himself he had some customers come from Germany. These people want to buy a book on Zuma. Mr. Morgan something weird is happening. I'm coming. Excuse me Isabel I gotta go. You better stay here. Pull! Go on pull! Harder! Harder! Wait! Galema? Hold the rope. Galema! I shall join you my child. Let go of me Zuma! Let go! Morgan come and help me! Let go Zuma! Galema! Hit him as hard as you can! Pull hard everyone! Morgan you're dead!

Morgan, you can't keep me here forever! The time will come when you will beg me for your life! You hear that? Galema... Morgan... I love you Galema. I've waited so long for this day. They look so happy together. Just like us. I fixed the water pump. We should have water soon. Galema? Are you worried about our baby? I just can't help it. It might be possible. That we won't have a normal baby. You know that. He'll be alright, I'm sure he will. I want to have the baby here. That'd be too dangerous. There could be complications and you'll need help or hospitalization. Morgan I've already asked Isabel. She said she'd come and help deliver the baby. It's possible the baby won't be normal and I don't want to scare anyone. You can't forget that I'm the child of Zuma. I can't hide the fact with the snakes on my shoulders. Please, let me have the baby at home. I don't want to see people laughing at our child. Our baby could become the laughing stock of town. They could call our child a monster. Listen to me Morgan... It is better to forget the hospital and let's have the baby at home. OK I won't argue with you. If that's what you want. Sir, dinner is ready. Come on let's eat. Be careful. Watch the steps. Okay. Are you ok? What's wrong? - I think the baby is coming. Hurry go call Isabel. Come give me a hand! Philip, this is Morgan. Galema is having the baby we need Isabel. We'll be there soon. It's okay, push darling. Come on dear, it's ok. Push... Push harder. Push, push. Come on now, push harder. Come on dear... Come on Galema push harder. That's it, it's coming... Push. Oh mighty lord, Oh powerful Kukulkan! Hear my prayers and help me escape from here. Get me out of here so I can continue my worship of you. Hear me, oh lord, you are the only one who can help me. Kukulkan! Hear me! Take me from this hell hole! Have mercy on me Lord! And I shall be you disciple... Forever! Oh little baby boy... He's got your eyes. -And your little nose. -Don't be silly. And your soft hair. -You're too much. -And he has your ears too. Morgan, he looks just like you too. What, he looks nothing like me. He's way to cute. -Just like you. -Come on. He's just way to cute to be like me. Even when I was a baby I was ugly. Can you believe that? Might be true. Akaba... What are you looking at? Go on. You don't want to hurt your brother do you? He would never do that. Are you sure? I don't trust him. Come on, stop that. Enough, I'm going to go take a shower. Should I join you. I'll be back soon, don't go anywhere. Bert? Bert, is that you? Oh my God! That's right Dino eat up. Eat as much as you can, you'll need your strength. You are the one who will kill Galema. Sister Irena. What are you doing up here? Just reading, mother. Shouldn't you be in bed? We have plenty to do tomorrow. And you're hiding up here reading? Yes, mother. This can only mean one thing. The way the victim was mutilated. I'm certain Zuma was responsible. You're right. I'm sure he'll be back again. Whoever it is we should put more guards on in case the murderer comes back. Galema. What are you doing here? I'm here to stop you Zuma. No Galema. No! Mr. Morgan, there goes Galema! Zuma! Zuma! Where's Philip? He told me to come here first. He's going to get backup, he thinks we'll need it. Galema, please help me. Help me my child. Galema, please help. Please help. I did warn you. You have to stop killing young virgins for their hearts, one day you'll pay for it. You brought this on yourself, I'm afraid it's too late. Please Galema, I'm only doing this... ...because I need to make sacrifices to my God. I promise, I'll never do it again. Don't believe him Galema. Murderers like hime never give a damn about other people. You stay out of this! Galema, I am your father! You must help me! After all you are the child of Zuma! You are the child of Zuma! Hurry, help me! Quickly! Hurry, I'm sinking! It's time Dino you are now ready to carry out the task I want you to do. I want you to go now, you will find Galema and kill her. You will know her by the snakes on her shoulders. I do not expect failure. So go and do this! And do not come back until you kill her. Don't you think it's time to clean up. We have lots to do tomorrow. Yeah, you are right. So, I guess I'll just clean up, while you sit around an play your guitar Kids help your mom, it's time for bed. Ok dad. -Where're you going? -To wash up the dishes. Here you are sir. Yep, thank you. Ok, goodbye. Where're you going? Morgan I feel that something is happening. Ok, you stay here. Stop! Leave him alone he's my husband. Why don't you fight me instead. Is he dead? No. He's just unconscious. Wha the hell is it? It's Dino. He is my brother. He must have been sent here to kill me. Morgan, we need to call Philip. He'll know what we can do. Good take Jean. Ok, let's pack up guys. Let's go. Shall we go. So you're getting married soon. yes, why? Thought Dino would make a great gift for the mother-in-law. Trying to be funny? My mother-in-law would kill me for that. Over there. Ah, Jean did you send out the invitations yet dear. Yes, I sent them all out yesterday. I'm really excited. I'm looking forward to seeing Philip and your Aunt Isabel. What's your brother up to? Why doesn't he have dinner with us? He should be back soon. He took me home and went off again. But he said he'd be home for dinner. I don't get to see him much lately. Oh no, is it your heart again? Dad! Dad! Oh powerful and mighty lord Kukulkan! I'm asking again, please help, oh lord. I don't know what to do. Sometime ago I ordered my son Dino to go and kill Galema. But... Dino has not come back and I don't know what has happened. Guide me my lord so I know how to get rid of my enemy Galema. Please answer my prayers. Please you must show me the way. Kukulkan... Please guide me... I will continue my sacrifices if you tell me how do I kill Galema? Galema gave birth to twins. One is a normal human and the other... is a white snake. The venom of the white snake is the only thing that can kill Galema. Venom of the snake. Venom of the snake. Venom of the snake. You hear that? The venom can kill Galema. Let me go. Please I beg you. Please, please why can't you just leave me alone. Why did you bring me here? What do you want? I beg you let me go. Can't you see I'm scared of you? Please leyt me go, I'm really scared. I don't want it! I don't want it! Ah, good boy. That's very good. Great kid isn't he. There. After this can you give him a bath and put him to bed. He's been up all day. Come on babe. Come on now. Come on have a drink dear. Be good for momma. Sir... This jungle is huge... What makes you think Dino brought Jean here? I don't know for sure Philip. But this is our only lead. Two boys reported seeing a thing that looked like Dino here. Philip let's turn back, I don't like this at all. Isabel, don't worry it will be all right. I promised Jeans' mom I would help. Everything will be fine. Let's go. Let me go! Let me go! Please let me go! Dino! Please! Please, what have I done? Let me go! Shine it in his eyes! Get the girl! Shine it in his eyes! Hold him back, I'll get Philip and Jean to the truck! 40?02 Come on hurry! Hurry! Let's go! Come on get it going! Use your flashlight! Though you are the child of Morgan and Galema... You are still one of us. You are still a snake. You will always belong to Kukulkan. You will always obey any command we give you. Galema has turned against us. She prefers to live in the world of men. She has to be punsihed for turning her back on her own kind. She must die. And you... Listen snake... You will carry out this task for us. Kill Galema! You must not fail! Hurry home now. Kill Galema! Remember you can not fail. Kill Galema! Wow, hello baby, you smell really good. Can you lift him? There... My little prince. Oh, yes I know your tired.

Ok, turn around again. What a good boy. Let's get your back now. Morgan! Morgan! -What happened? -I don't know, she just passed out. Galema... Doctor. The oxygen mask. Give her 1cc of adrenaline. Morgan... What happened? I don't know. The maid said she passed out. The doctor is still with her. Doctor, how is Galema? She died. We couldn't get her back. I'm sorry. That's impossible, she couldn't have died. You must do something to save Galema! She came to us to late. There was nothing we could do. I'm sorry. Um, Doctor... I have an idea. What if we gave her a blood transfusion from her son? Well, you may not believe it. But the white snake and her son are twin brothers. But it's our last hope. We'll give it a try. Doctor, please do it. Who knows it might just work. Do what you have to do. I don't want to lose Galema. Thank you very much. You want to see Galema? Thank God she's alive. Thank you Philip. I think we should split up. I'll go that way. We'll meet back up. See you. Where are you? Come on, we don't want to hurt you. We know it wasn't your fault. Come one, where are you? Morgan... You know what we need to do to save Galema. I understand. Oh, my God! Look at the snakes! I could go for some tea. -I ate to much at the party. -OK, sure. Philip! Philip, help there's snakes! Go get the shotgun. Hurry. Philip! Philip! Philip! The whole place is filled with snakes! Let's get out of here. Come on! Your house isn't the only one crawling with snakes. You know Philip, we got a call saying the whole town is crawling wih snakes. This can only mean that Zuma is alive somewhere. All right chief. These snakes are afraid of fire, so we can get rid of them. I think we should use flamethrowers to clear the area. Well done! We stopped another one of Zuma's evil tricks! They are celebrating to soon. Zuma will be back. And he will try to kill Galema. Then we must do everything we can to protect her. I know Isabel. I'll do anything. I'll give my life to protect everyone. No one else should be hurt by this evil... Or die... Akaba and Galema... Who else will suffer. Together we... need to... end this. I swear... I will kill Zuma. If it's the last thing I do. I'm going to go and gather some men. And hunt down Zuma. Philip, please be careful. Dino! Dino! Dino! Dino! Dino! Where are you? Dino! Come out! I want to talk to you! Dino! Dino! Mr. Philip! Mr. Philip! Sergeant! Grab the gasoline! There he is! Dino... Zuma is your enemy. He's going to kill all the virgins. He won't stop until he's killed all the young girls in Pablo. Even Jean. If you love her you must do all you can to stop him. Oh, Dino... You must listen to Philip. If you love me you must stop him. And if you don't do it. Jean will die. Zuma will murder her. Go and kill Zuma now Dino! Come on Dino! Go and kill Zuma! OK, let him out. So Dino, you would fight your own father? You shouldn't turn against me! I'm the one who looked after you! These people behind you, they are your enemies! You are one of us, you must do as I say, not them! Our race is going to rule the world! Help me or die! Do as I say, now! Dino, don't listen to Zuma, he is just using you! He is after my heart and wants to kill me too! Come on Dino, you must kill Zuma! Kill him or I will leave you! Stop it! Don't listen to that girl! Don't do it! You must kill Zuma! Zuma! Galema... I thought you were dead. I'm still alive Zuma. Your plan didn't work. I know it was you who sent my son to kill me. I'll never forgive you for that. That's enough Zuma, you have to die! Morgan, if you want to live you will do as I say. Do you understand? Galema! Please forgive me Galema. I had no choice but to tell him where the white snake was hiding or he'd kill me. I was worried about that. Thank God I found you. If I was any later... You would have been devoured by the snakes. Galema. I agree with what Philip said. We should look for Zuma. Instead of waitnig for him to come to us. We can't wait for him to attack again. What's going on, will you stop moving? Where's the bread? And the sausages? I'll go get some now. -Save some for me. -You don't have to go, where's Millie? I sent her out for a few things. You have a big appetite tonight. Can you eat them all? Sure, there's no much there. Come on, stop moving. Galema! Galema? Hey guys! I just saw Zuma! He's over tha way! -Zuma! -Go call evreyone! Come on let's get the weapons! Hey, what's going on? Zuma's coming! They saw him over there! Oh no, please don't kill me! Your death is not enough to please me. I'm going to kill you and all your people. But, you won't die so easily. You better pray to your God's and wish you were never born. Beg for your life! Forget it Philip, your guns can't kill me. Prepare to die! I wish you could see your face! Come on and fight me! Look at you! You are nothing! Kill me then Zuma! I'm not going to submit to you! I curse you! I'd rather die then submit to you! Zuma! Come get me! He's no match for you! It's me you want! Zuma! Don't run away! Come back you coward! -Are you OK Philip? -Go after him. Go, don't let him get away. Get Zuma... You can beat him... You must kill him... Hurry... -He's getting away. -Zuma! -Zuma! -Kill him! Kill him! You go that way. Galema! You're not going to leave here alive. I thought you were smart. Yet, you easily fell into my trap. Soon, you will meet the race of Zuma! You will die Galema! You will die! I'm not scared and I'm ready to die! Before I die.... I'll kill you! Show yourself! Coward! Sarge? Listen soldier, you should leave Galema. She's only using you. Get out before it is to late. Never listen to Zuma. If you believe what he says, then... Zuma! Go away! Come back here!
