(ticking) (eerie music) - [Man] Listen. (clock ticking) Do you hear it? It's the clock. It mocks me. (thunder rumbling) Because it knows my secret. (thunder booming) (dreadful music) (rain pattering) (electric buzzing) (clanking) Shh, he's here. - [Man] Maybe you should just stop. Just don't do it. - [Man] I can't. - [Man] Why? - [Man] Because I've gone too far. (thunder booming) (stormy music) (bells jingling) (door creaking) - [Man] Show in 30. (banging) (suspenseful music) (metallic clanking) (door banging) (train clacking) (powerful rock music) (Alex grunts) - Jessica! Jess! (persevering music) (moves into princess-like music) - [Jessica] And the little fairy returned home, never to fear again. (Alex grunts) (bemused music) - Jess! Jessica! (Alex grunts) Jessica! Jess! (Alex grunts) Jess, get this blasted thing off me, would ya? - Hold on a sec! I got an idea! - Jessica, where are you going? I, I can't breathe! (Alex grunts) (mischievous music) Jessica, what are you doing? (suspicious music) (clicking) (electronic beeping) (Alex grunts) (metal clanking) - See, it worked. - What worked? - My idea. - Your idea of what, pain and suffering? - No, of getting you free. See, you're free. - You know, I don't think I like your ideas. (glass shattering) (heavy thudding) - Nice knowing you. (crashing) (scary music) (train whistle wailing) (Jessica screams) (thunder rumbling) Where are you going?! (shadowy music) - Who do you think they were? - Bad guys. (cellphone ringing) (dog barking) (misty music) - [Mom] Hey guys, it's... (static buzzing) I think I have a bad connection. I'm running a little late. Alex, heat up the leftovers from last night and don't forget to feed the dog. Oh, and tell your sister not to overfill the bathtub! (banging on the wall) - Jessica! Don't overfill the bathtub! - [Jessica] Please don't eat me! (water splashing) (water sucking) (shaded music) (electronic beeping) - Thanks, mom. This'll sorta make up for the lame birthday. (phone beeping) (water dripping) (door creaking) (pleasant music) (bell dings) (phone ringing) (dog barking) Hey, yeah, um, I'd like to order a pizza. (bemused music) (bell dings) (knocking on the door) Hey little ewok, dinner's ready. (squishing) (Alex sighs) (banging on the door) Let me in! - [Jessica] Excuse me? - The carpet, Jessica, it's like a swamp down there! - [Jessica] I'm sorry, but I'm a lady, and I'm inappropriately dressed at the moment. You'll have to come back later. - Ugh! (cellphone ringing) (beeps) - [John] Alex, uh, it's, it's dad again. Did you know that conviction is an uncommon thing? Only when you lay your head down at night do you feel its gnawing teeth. Maybe that's why I can't sleep at night. And my writings only bring conviction. (creepy music) (gate creaking) (knocking on the door) - [Jessica] Who is it? Who is it? - [Mom] The pizza guy. - The pizza guy? You don't sound like the pizza guy. - [Mom] Open the door. - Cool! Pizza! (suspicious music) - [Man] Delivered. (mysterious music) (knocking on the door) - Some nice man left this for you. - Um, thanks. (puzzled music) (moves into serious music) - [Mom] Why don't you try knocking next time? - Total extraction. - Alex, English. I am tired. - I was totally ripped out of a place I knew. - You know why, come on. - What, dad? - Your father left us. I was running out of options. - He left us? Then why is he still there and we're here? - What? - He didn't have to pack. He didn't have to move. We moved. So how did he leave us? - He completely abandoned his role as husband and father. I consider that leaving. - Over something he loves? - No, over something he hated, like being a responsible father! - There's nothing really wrong with what he did. - Do you wanna go to college one day? It requires money. - He said he's gonna pay it all back. - Oh, really? Well I'm extremely impressed with your vast knowledge of personal financing. Alex, you're 17. - I know what comes after 17 too. - Oh good, I'm glad you can count. - And when I'm 18... - I'm sure the Army would love to have you. - I'm thinking there's a better option, and he lives across town. - Why can't you be more like me and less like your father? - Oh, (laughs) I'm sorry, I forgot. You're perfect, aren't you? - Alex, that's not what I mean. - Almost perfect then. - No! - You know what? God's holy couldn't live up to your self-righteous standards! - How dare you! - Let me share a little story with you. Dad still loves you. He didn't want us to leave and he's sorry for what he did. - Alex, stop. - This Sunday you'll be wanting to go to church. You'll be hounding me to come along. Well you can tell the congregation he's gone fishing! (door slams) (dramatic music) (mom crying) (door creaking) (water splashing) (drain sucking) (door creaking) (questing music) (Jessica clears her throat) - No! - Okay, that's for making mom cry last night. - I'm gonna make you cry in two seconds! Stop it! - Mommy's at work, but she left this. "Jessica, clean that den of squalor you call a room." I'm not sure what squalor means. Do you know what that means? - Just go on. - "Alex, the last time I checked "you still are unemployed and need gas "to operate your motorized vehicle. "Therefore, I strongly suggest you mow the lawn." Wow, mom sure has a way with words, don't she? - Just stop it! (uninterested music) (door creaking) (clattering) (motor rumbling) (eerie music) (banging) - [Man] Hey kid, hold that fence plank still! (banging) That should do! Let go! (banging) (keys jingling) (creepy music) - Are you okay? I saw what, accidentally saw what happened yesterday. (mysterious music) (keys clattering) - Huh, guess I need to work on that. Tell your sister to wash up. The yard looks pretty good. - Wish I could say the same about dinner. - Okay, I'll tell her. - Tell me what, sweetie? - Something's going on next door. See, I said it. - What kind of stuff? - Scary stuff! - What she's trying to say is I spoke with dad yesterday and he doesn't like the neighborhood. I'm gonna have to agree with him on that one. - Okay, so now you have your father involved? - He's just concerned. He really misses us and he's been voice messaging me lately and some of the messages have been kind of, you know. - What? - Odd, bizarre, strange, you pick. - Well it is your father you're talking about. That doesn't surprise me. - He did a safety check on the neighborhood. - What did that show? - A lot of red dots. - Yeah, mommy, and I think the guy next door is involved with criminal stuff. Right, Alex? - Uh, maybe. Dad said one of those red dots showed up next door and he wants us out of here and back home. - All right, that's it. You stay out of his yard and out of his sight. You got it? I was talking to a friend at work and she invited us to church. - Oh joy. - Oh no, it gets better. She needs someone to help out with her yard work. - Isn't Jessica a little young for that? - She is, but you're not. (Jessica laughs) - Oh come on! - You need the money. - Can't I just work at the mall or something? People who go to church make me feel uncomfortable. They're always so self-righteous. - You think they're gonna judge you on how you cut grass? - No, there's other stuff. - Oh really? Are you confessing? - No, I'm leaving. - But you can't! - And why can't I? - Because it's your night. - My night for what? - To do the dishes. - Well tell the boss I'm taking a sick day. (dramatic music) (typing) (questioning music) - I have potato soup inside if you're hungry! - No, I, I was looking for something I lost. I live right here. - It must be pretty important that you'd dumpster dive for it. - Just something I accidentally threw away, no big deal. - Well I'm glad you found it. My name is Willy Harper. I'm your next door neighbor. - I'm Alex. - Well Alex, I guess we're neighbors. - I best be getting inside. The warden doesn't like inmates out after dark. - So your parents keep you on a short leash? - Just my mom. My parents are separated at the moment. My dad has all the money and my mom has all the rules. - I'm sorry to hear that, but you still only have one family. - Do parents living in separate houses count as one or two? - It still counts as one. - I best be getting inside. - Well good night, neighbor. - Yeah, see ya. - [Jessica] Look, mommy. - [Mom] Wow, you're good! What's up, Doc? - [Jessica] What? - [Mom] Oh, never mind. - [Jessica] Roar! - [Mom] Ah, you got me! (Jessica laughs) - Mommy, do you still love daddy? - What makes you say that? - Just because. - Well, between me and you and Mister Bear here, I do. I can honestly say I do. We just have things to work out, that's all. Now you need to get some sleep. (kissing) - I just wondered something. - What's that? - Do you think daddy misses us? - Oh I know he misses you. - What about you and Alex? - I'm sure he misses Alex very much. - But not you? Is that why you live in different houses? - Well when you get big... - Like five feet tall? - Like five feet tall, things get really complicated. - Kind of like trying to explain things about God, stuff like that? - Exactly. - You know what? - What? - I don't think Alex really cares anything about God. (somber music) (mom sniffling) (ominous music) (engine rumbling) - [Radio DJ] Hey out there, radio land, you're listening to the best station in the city, where we'll be playing all your favorites. - John, what are you up to? - [Radio DJ] The station that makes you wanna listen.

Last seen entering her home next door on June the 7th. Since then routine trips to the hair salon and the grocery store have ended abruptly. She won't answer calls. The garden that she tends is wilting. Her husband filed a report, but he has been suspiciously unsupportive. - And she's still missing? - We think we know where she is. - Next door? - Yeah, but we just don't know which room. - Okay, that's creepy. - Well we want you to be our eyes and ears for a little while, you know, keep track of his coming and goings. But one thing, stay off his property. - What do you mean? - Otherwise I fear for your life. (creepy music) (dog barks) - [Alex] Ow. - [Christina] (laughs) I see dogs don't take to you so well. - Cute and cuddly, yes. Dogzilla, no. - (laughs) Didn't know you worked for the FBI. - Ah, just the neighborhood watch. It's a long story, full of life and death peril, high drama, misdemeanor. I'm sure you don't have time for my personal problems. - Are you kidding me? I'm here for a week with a man four times my age. I'm pretty sure I can handle a change in pace. - All right, well uh, how do I put this? The guy next door, uh, ck his wife. - No way. - It's true. - How do you know? - [Alex] Got it all on my phone. - So you're saying you recorded it. Did you send it to the police? - Uh, I didn't really get him doing the deed, but I got him in a gnarly fight with some detectives. - Mm, yeah, sounds kinda lame. - I think it happened a while back, maybe a couple months ago. Police didn't find anything, but some detectives still believe that she's still in the house. (weighty music) What's wrong? - Doesn't this stuff kinda freak you out? Like, there could be a dead body next door. - Not really. I mean, if you think about it, there's dead bodies at the cemetery down the street. Guess I just don't think about death that much. - I used to think like that. Then I saw something. Something that changed me. - What was it? Hello, Christina, what was it? - What? - What'd you see? - Right here. It's crazy how something so small can make such a big impact on your life. - [Alex] I don't get it. What's in the envelope? - Alex, do you believe in God? - I don't know. I don't really think about stuff like that. I'm not that spiritual, you know. - Spiritual, is that what you're calling it? I thought we were just talking. - If you are, you'd get along great with my mom. - No, I mean, have you ever thought about like what happens after you die? - Yeah, you're buried. - After you're buried. - Okay, well there's a lot of sad music playing. - [Christina] No, Alex. - Okay, I don't get what you're getting at. - You have a soul that lives on forever somewhere. - You are spiritual, and you're preaching at me. - [Willy] Christina, we gotta go! - Gotta run. My granddaddy's taking me to the mall. And I might be spiritual, but this girl's got a carnal side too. Shopping! (mystified music) (clattering) - [Alex] Come on, Jess! You're taking so long I just had another birthday! - I'm coming already! You need to work on your patience! Mm. Ah. There you are. Got it! (questing percussion music) - Okay, now I need you to pay close attention or somebody's gonna get hurt. Probably me, but I'm okay with that. You're young. - Affirmative! - Now I know we've been advised to stay off the neighbor's property, but I deducted a more aggressive approach is necessary to crack this case. - What? - Hand me the dog. We're going in. (ritualistic percussion music) Are you serious? - But he's my favorite! - Look, I've met the neighbor's dog. He looks nothing like this. We need something with more attitude, something like that. Rah! See, that's more like the neighbor's dog. - But Alex! - Shh! So I'm thinking our biggest challenge is gonna be the bite-osaurus in the backyard, so for the moment that means a backyard assault is out. I'm thinking a frontal assault is the ticket. We'll lay low and we'll be stealthy. - But I got... - Please hold your questions til the end. Sheesh. Okay. Mom gets off work at 11:00, which means she'll be home around 11:20, give or take a minute or two. That means that our plan has to be executed no later than 10:00 p.m. sharp. We'll use the cover of night as our ally. The little raging monster will never know we're there. Will you, you little beastie? (laughs) Woof! All right, any questions? - I think you mean meow, because this is a cat. See his little whiskers right there? Look at his pointy ears. Look at his fluffy little paws! (serious music) Stop bumping so much! You sound like you're stuttering. - Sorry, the connection's... - Alex? Alex! - Just hit your bike. Hold on, is that better? - Yeah, what did you do? - Stopped moving. - Alex? - Shh! Hold on! I don't know if this is good or bad. - What do you mean? - There's no lights on. He might not be home. I'm gonna go closer. (suspenseful music) - Don't get risky. - Too late. - Why do you say that? - I'm in his front lawn. - What's back there? Looks like a light. (frightened music) Alex! (scary music) Alex? Alex! - [Alex] Sorry, my hand slipped. - Maybe you should come back now. - Hold on. I think there's a basement light on. I'm gonna go take a closer look. (intrepid music) (beeping) - Why don't you work already! (creepy music) - Hey, what's that? (dramatic music) (keys jingling) - Alex, hide, you've gotta hide. The man's home! (panicky music) Alex, please hide! Alex! (keys jingling) (dramatic music) - [Man] I know you're there! I can smell your sneakers. (tense music) (dog barking) - Gotta call 911! Gotta call 911! (frantic music) (knocking on the door) Who is it? (apprehensive music) (knocking on the door) Who is it? - [Alex] It's me, Jess, just let me in. - You about scared the poo out of me! Did the man see you? - I don't know, but that dog sure did. He got a good nip of my shoulder too. - You need to call 911! - No, I'm fine. - We need to call the police! - And tell them what, Jess? That I was sneaking around my neighbor's yard taking pictures? No, thank you. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. You know that dog next door? - Yeah. - He's nothing like your Littlest Pet Shops. (phone rings) - It's mommy! Hello mommy, are you okay? (dial tone beeping) She hung up. - Just a bad connection. She'll call back. - Alex, I'm scared. - Of what? I mean, just look around you. We live in a great house. Our mom works nights. We have a neighbor who absolutely adores us. I mean, life couldn't be better, right? - If you're trying to be funny, it's not working. - It is funny. The only thing is God's telling the jokes and we're the punchline. - Don't say that! (thudding) (keys jingling) - Get down. (terrified music) (door creaking) - [Mom] Hey guys, I'm home. - Mommy! I'm so glad to see you! - That's a homecoming. Alex? - Hey, mom. - Your greetings are actually getting better. All right, to bed in 15. It's getting late. All right, come on sweetie, we gotta get to bed. Oh, and don't forget to brush your teeth. - But I brushed them yesterday! - Oh, this place is a mess. (exhausted music) Alex, why are you all sweaty? - I was working out. - You shouldn't be running at night. And who's watching your sister? (perplexed electronic music) - [Alex] Why are you hiding stuff from us? - Excuse me? - I found something. - What's that? - Something from dad, like one of his books or something. - Well you know your dad. He's a writer. He writes stuff. - Don't you think me and Jessica need to know about stuff like this? Has he mentioned this? - He said he was writing a play or something. - What else has he written? - A few things. - I wanna see them. All of them. - You need to go to bed or you can hand me your car keys. - You should use truth and not power. - And now he's a philosopher. (eerie music) (metallic clinking) (cellphone ringing) (Jessica screams) - Are you okay? What happened? - I, I did it last time. - You gotta stop this twisting and twirling. - But it's my recital. (sad music) - [Christina] I was in the hospital for almost two days. - What? - Doing that stuff, gymnastics. I fell down the stairs when I was five. My still hurts from time to time. - Me too, ouch! - You might wanna put some ice on that tonight. - Will do. Sounds like you've had your shares of ups and downs. - Haven't we all? - Don't get me started. - Hey, how's your neighbor? - [Alex] I actually paid him a visit last night. - Really, what'd he say? - Nothing, til he came home. I probably should've let him know I was coming over. - [Christina] Yeah. - It's a real den of iniquity over there. He's hiding something major in the basement. - What do you mean? - Took my phone. Video speaks for itself. - What'd you record? - Plenty. - Let me see! - 8:00, my place. - Are you asking me out on a date? - If I was, would that be a problem? - Only if you wore cheap cologne. I gotta go. See you later. - [Alex] Hey, hold on. Is that a yes? - [Christina] Come a little closer. - What? - [Christina] I said come a little closer.

Do you have more than one? - No, this is the shirt. - There's just something different. But I like it. - Good. You know what they say. - And what do they say, Alex? - You gotta keep the customer satisfied. - Really? Hey, so what's going on with your neighbor? - Got something that'll give you a sleepless night. (creepy music) And cut. The end. What do you think? - I think it gives me the creeps. Do you really think she's in that box? It could just be power tools. - Negative. The length and shape, that's either his wife or what's left of her. - Okay, now you're really freaking me out. - I'm just saying. We've got a killer on the loose. It's my neighborhood, it's my problem. - And what are you, Batman? I know the perfect people that could help out with this. They have these bright lights on top of their cars. Most people call them the police. - It's a cold case, Christina. It's a missing person. They've got private investigators on it now and I'm helping out. - I don't know. I was always taught that if it makes your hair stand on end, don't. And that's how I'm feeling right about now. - Oh come on. Sometimes you gotta flirt with danger to find the truth. - And what are you, some two-bit philosopher? This guy could really mess you up, like rest in peace kinda stuff. - Well then I'd just be a ghost, kinda floating around, you know. Maybe I'd come back and haunt you. Or is that what you're afraid of? - Alex, once you die, you don't come back. You don't float around. It doesn't work like that. - Really? You sound like my mom. Besides, I don't plan on dying anytime soon anyways. - Neither did my best friend. - Best friend? - Yeah, but I can't really talk about it right now. - Oh come on Christina. What happened? - Last summer she was in her car in front of me driving like crazy. Anyways, I came up the rise and saw this orange glow by a tree. And I knew it was her. I did everything I could to help her get out of her car, but it was too late. Her cries sent shivers (woman screaming) down my spine. I can still hear her screaming, "Help me, I'm burning." - I'm really sorry. - Have you ever seen what fire does to long blonde hair soaked in hairspray? (woeful music) It's like etched in my brain, but that's not it. - What do you mean? - The purse. - Purse? (haunting music) - Her purse lying on the asphalt, with something I gave her sticking out of the top. - [Alex] What was it? The envelope. - Before the paramedics got there, I went over and got this out of her purse. Maybe that was wrong, but I had to keep it. Mr. Harper gave it to me when I was only 10 years old, and that's when I read it. That's when what it said changed me. I guess it's a part of me now. - Really? A gospel tract? - Do you know? - Yes, Christina, I've gone to Sunday school before. - I met God. Or He met me. But I feel different. - You got saved? - Yeah, I did. I gave this to my friend and told her to read it within five days. - [Alex] Well did she? - On the fifth day the accident happened. - [Alex] I'm sure she read it. She'll be just fine. - No, she didn't. - Don't be so negative, Christina. How do you know? - You see this? I put this here when I asked her to read it. It's the same as it was when I gave it to her, still unbroken. - I'm really sorry. Maybe God made an exception for her. - No. No exceptions. You get one lifetime to make your decision, then game over. You don't just float around or hang out. You're separated from God forever. - Okay, stop! I'm not ready for this. - For what? - This! I know what you're getting at. It's not my time. I'm not ready. - [Christina] Well then promise me this one thing. - And what's that? - [Christina] You'll carry this tract for five days and remember the story I told you. - Yeah, sure. - Don't wait til day five. Seems to be the unlucky day. And there's one more thing that's been bothering me. - Yeah? - You know that shirt you're wearing? - Yeah. - It's on backwards. (weighty piano music) (sirens whirring) (thunder rumbling) - [Christina VOICEOVER] The cries sent shivers down my spine. ♪ Yeah ♪ Pushing - I can still hear her screaming, "Help me, I'm burning." (siren wailing) The purse. The purse lying on the asphalt, with something I gave her sticking out of the top. - [Alex VOICEOVER] A gospel tract? - [Christina VOICEOVER] I met God, or He met me, but I feel different. - [Alex VOICEOVER] You got saved? - [Christina VOICEOVER] Yeah, I did. - Okay, stop, I'm not ready for this. (misty music) (sirens wailing) (heartbeat pounding) - [Christina VOICEOVER] No, no exceptions. You get one lifetime to make your decision, then game over. You don't just float around and hang out. You're separated from God forever. (thunder rumbling) (haunting music) (clock ticking) (dog barking) - I really don't like those. I just fake it. - Really? How old are you? You need to eat your fruit. It's good Vitamin C. (Jessica sighs) (engine rumbling) (tires squealing) (eerie music) - [Christina VOICEOVER] Well then promise me this one thing. You'll carry this tract for five days and you'll remember the story I told you. (shadowy music) (metallic clinking) (Jessica squealing) (heavenly music) (heartbeat pounding) (moves into ominous music) - Here's something or you, kiddo. (creepy music) (banging) - What? - A plan for tonight, five minutes, my room. (Jessica sighs) I've been doing some spying on the man next door. - Yeah? - And I've discovered something. His car always leaves at the same time on Thursdays, 8:30 sharp. - Why do you think Thursdays? - I don't know. Maybe he's taken up bowling. The point is he doesn't come back til like 11:00, which gives us a pretty good window. (doorbell rings) - You know littering is like a $500 fine, don't you? - [Jessica] Hey, Christina. - But I'll let it slide this time. Hey Alex, this has your name on it a couple times. You want it back? - There's like four Alexes on this block. It's probably one of the ones down the street. - Got it. Wanna go along? And I thought you wanted to go pro. - Too short. - And about 200 pounds too light. Hey Christina, you got a second? - [Christina] Yeah. (scary music) - Then his car is gone, which I think is a good time to strike. - Okay, question. Strike what? - Yeah, Alex, what are you gonna do, send in your ground forces? - No. But I do wanna see what's in that box though. - There's no way unless you go inside. - Exactly. - Excuse me? - He'll be gone. - And what if he isn't? Guess what? (Jessica imitates choking) Exactly. Lights out, a permanent night night. - Yeah, Alex. He probably has booby traps in his house, you know. - I guess I'm just worried that you're not thinking this through, like all the consequences. - Look, nothing ventured nothing gained, right? - I remember that one. The guy that said that died in the desert, didn't he? - (laughs) Look, I've got like a two-hour window. He'll never know I was there. - Wait a second. Can't you just give all this information to the investigators and let them do the dirty work? - These investigators are counting on me, you know, to solve the case. And maybe to make the 6:00 news. - Okay, Bruce Wayne. - Actually, I could live with that. - You're insane. I can't believe we're even talking like this. - Hey, you said you wanted a change in pace, right? Kinda boring next door. - I meant something that didn't end in a funeral. - I need someone to watch my back, and Jess is too short. - Thanks, Alex. - You're half crazy! But you're just too cute. And I'm insane for saying this that I'll be in, but under one condition. - What's that? - You won't make me dress up as Wonder Woman. - Bummer. (Jessica and Christina laughing) All right, it's a deal. Jess, you'll be at HQ. You'll be our eyes in the sky. - Affirmative. - We'll call you Mother Goose. - Nice. (phone rings) I'll get it. Hello? Hello, mommy, is that you? Nobody's there. - Hello? (tense music) (dial tone beeping) - Meow! - [Alex] Say what? - You look like a black kitty cat. - This is how you dress for a covert operation. - Yeah, a covert whatever. - I think I have everything I need. Wish me luck. - Luck. Be careful, Alex. - Thanks, kiddo. (fingers snapping) - Hey, you look like that guy from the termite commercial. - Maybe you know me better by my last name. Talk to Jones. - [Jessica] But you look like termite... - Sh, just go with it. Is Christina here yet? (doorbell rings) Never mind. - I don't know which is worse, the butterflies in my stomach or the lump in my throat. How do you feel? - I don't know. Kind of like I feel before a big game. We might have a problem. Check this out. (creepy music) - Maybe he's staying in for the night. The weather looks pretty bad. (phone rings) - Sheesh, and I thought I was antsy. (dreadful music) - His car's still there. - I can see that, Jess. - You mean Mother Goose. - I can see that, Mother Goose. - 10-four. Otherwise, everything looks good from HQ. Mother Goose, out! - Why did I have to give her a call sign? Get down! (keys jingling) (footsteps thudding) (suspenseful music) (engine rumbling) - [Christina] Whoa. - What's wrong? - I think my heart just skipped a beat. - Already? - Why, is there a better time? - Yeah, when we're crawling through his basement window. We better gear up. - Intense. - Got a little weapon for you. - What, no, I can't shoot. - You don't have to. Just aim. - Gee, thanks. You didn't have anything smaller to give me, did you? - Hey, it's a nice light. Any second thoughts? - Oh, you'd be the first to know. - Gotcha. (scary music) - [Jessica] Looks like we have a problem. - What's that? - Looks like the backyard gate was left open, but it's kinda hard to see. - Great. Any sign of that dog? - Negative. - [Alex] Jess, I need you to come downstairs. - You mean leave the HQ? - Yes, Jess, I need you to leave HQ and meet me downstairs right now. - Affirmative! Mother Goose out! - [Alex] Jess, I need you to the backyard. - Why for? - Because of the gate. - The dog. - You got it. If he gets out, it's game over. I need you to listen to me. I want you to go back there and put your iPad in the hole in the fence. You'll be safe there. - To spy on the mean dog? - Exactly. You're gonna give me a constant view of whatever he's up to. Me and Christina are gonna go stay back. Any questions? Don't worry, we got this. Ready? - Break! (wind chimes clinking) (thrilling music) You know what? - What? - I can think of 1,001 things I'd rather be doing right now. - Oh come on. I'm about to give you a summer you'll never forget. (thunder rumbling) - Hey, I just thought of one more thing. (terrified music) - [Jessica] Stop, Alex! - What? - Listen! I see the dog! - Where? (dog barking) - Coming your way! You better run! Alex, hurry! (dog barking) - Christina, get over here! - [Christina] What do you want me to do? - Get the screwdriver out of my pocket! - [Christina] What? - My pocket, the screwdriver! Other pocket! Put it in the latch! Over that plank! - Okay, my hearts not skipping beats anymore. - [Alex] That's good. - No. My heart's not beating at all. - Jessica. Jessica! (mysterious music) Jess! - Jessica! (ominous music) - Jessica? You okay? (emotional music) - I wanna go home. - You are home. - I don't mean here, my real home. I don't wanna be here anymore. - That makes two of us. (aching music) I'm sure she'll be all right. - Nothing a little psych treatment can't help, huh? (Alex laughs) - All right, we got about an hour. - Are you kidding me? And all I have is this pee light! - It's a pen light. - Oh, like that makes it any better. I was almost eaten by the beast of the backyard. Oh, and if that's not bad enough, I just ruined my best pair of shoes. Can't we just call it a night and snuggle our pillows? - I gotta go. Now I'm asking for your help. I don't wanna do this without you. - Oh, I guess I should feel touched. (cellphone ringing) - Hold on. It's Jessica. - [Jessica] Mother Goose to Alex. - [Alex] Go ahead, Mother Goose. - I called to let you know something. - Go ahead. - I wanted to let you know that HQ is back online! - (laughs) Atta girl. - Oh, I must be dreaming. Oh, now I see. - What's that? - The psychological problems run throughout this entire family! (questing music) I thought you said the window was half open! - Shh! I don't want that dog freak out again. It was. (uncertain music) (thunder rumbling) (banging) - What's going on? - Hurry! - This is turning freaky fast. - Alex, you have like a minute. Please hurry. - I am. Stop telling me the time. (scary music) Whoa. Tales From the Crypt. - [Christina] Any sign of that box? - Not yet. You'll be the first to know. (thunder rumbling) (electric buzzing) (terrifying music) - Alex, get out of there! (eerie music) - Oh! (misty music) - Is that people? Real people? - It's just a mannequin. (thunder rumbling) (mysterious music) Jessica, any movement down the street? - Checking! Looks clear, but hurry! - I see the box. (scary music) - Alex, hurry! (eerie music) - [Alex] What? I, I don't get it. - [Mom] Get what? - [Alex] I don't understand why you're here. - Alex, it's mom. You're home. - [Alex] I saw him, last night. Right there in front of me. - Saw who? Who did you see? - Dad. (stormy music) - Oh, I know. He brought you home. The weather was horrible. - [Alex] Why was he there? - I don't know, we didn't talk much. It, it was really late. - I can't think right now. My head's a beehive. - Just let me get you something. Relax. (dreadful music) About last night, are you aware that you were trespassing? - Trespassing? I don't think that's the right word for it. - Okay, then what is? - Maybe unwelcomed invitation. - Alex. - Look, I was helping out some detectives. We were trying to solve a case. You said I needed a job. - Well that's good timing. - What? - There's a detective here, wants to talk to you. And he does not look like he's here to give you a paycheck. - Right now? - Unfortunately, yes. And he just talked to your little friend next door. - Christina? Mom, she's not my little friend. She's 16, all right. Is she okay? - She's okay, but I can't believe you drug her into this. - She never went in the house. She was just there to keep me company. - And your little sister? - Well technically, she never left our house. - Well that's comforting. - [Alex] All right. I see where this is going. - Where? - With me handing over my keys, that's where. - Oh, am I that predictable? - No comment. - I found something rather intriguing last night. Talks about a guy named Alex exploring a spooky basement, in search of a missing person named Judith Light. Alex, do you know what this is about? - Hm. (clock ticking) Did you bring your gun? - Maybe. - Do you ever use it? - Oh, once or twice. - Have you shot anybody? - Just bad people. - Oh. - And people who talk a lot. (veiled music) Alex, we kinda have a mess here. You stepping onto his property was not a part of the deal. - Well is the man next door pressing charges? - Well it's hard to say, ma'am. I've only spoken to him briefly, but I can tell you this. He is not happy. - Well Alex is only 17. He's just a kid. - Ma'am, 17 is considered an adult in this state, and frankly, your son is in some serious... Well, you know what I mean. - You mean doodoo. Is that what you mean? - Uh, something like that. - Jessica, I have a fresh bar of soap in the bathroom. Would you like to take a nibble? - I'm just saying, mommy. Alex might be going to jail. - Jessica! Sir, I'm sure if I can speak to him directly, we can sort things out. - I'm afraid not, ma'am. - Alex, you are going to jail! - Jessica! Excuse me. Why don't you run outside and catch me some butterflies. - She just says that because she wants me to leave. - Thank you, sweetie, go on. - But I haven't even finished my breakfast yet. Sheesh. - And make sure you throw your wrapper out, in the trash this time. (door slams) - Can I ask a favor? - Sure. - I need to speak to Alex privately. - Oh, I don't think I can do that. I don't think I want to do that. Aren't there any parental rights here? - I understand that, but I need to corroborate his story with the young girl's, and you might be a distraction. It'll just be a few minutes. - All right, five minutes. And Alex, tell him the truth. - Yeah, sure mom, whatever you say. - Alex, I need to show you something. The briefcase, let's look inside. (suspenseful music) Do you realize that most ideas start off as words? - Okay. - And words tell us where to go and what to do. - What are you talking about? - Let me show you. Take a look at this paper. It has words on it. But look closer. They're telling you what to do. - Christina brought over a green sheet of paper like this. - Hey Alex, this has your name on it a couple times. Do you want it back? - Had my name on it. - That's because you're in it. - In what? - Here, let me show you. (dramatic music) - Is this some kinda joke! - (laughs) You just needed a starting point. (perplexed music) And some motivation to get going. Surrounded by intriguing characters. - [Man] Hey kid, hold that fence plank still. - You became a vital part of the story. - [Alex VOICEOVER] I found something, something from dad, like one of his books or something. - [Mom VOICEOVER] Well you know your dad. He's a writer. He writes stuff. (doorbell rings) - Dad! - Would you have expected anything else? From a desperate father? - But, but all this, it's, it's all make-believe? Why would you do something like this? (voices rapidly talking over each other) (eerie music) (clock ticking) - [John] Listen. Do you hear it? It's the clock. It mocks me. Because it knows my secret. - Maybe you should just stop, just don't doing it. - [John] I can't. - [Ron] Why? - [John] Because I've gone too far. - [Alex VOICEOVER] This is turning freaky fast. - [Christina VOICEOVER] Alex! You have like a minute, please hurry! - [Alex VOICEOVER] I am, stop telling me the time! (dramatic music) - [Jessica VOICEOVER] You've gotta hurry! The man's home! The man's home! Get out of there! - [John VOICEOVER] He's coming. He's coming. - [Jessica VOICEOVER] Alex, please hurry! Please hurry! You've gotta get out of there! - [Alex VOICEOVER] Jessica, any movement down the street? (bells jingling) - [John] Where did I find you last night? - [Alex] Next door. - [John] But where next door? (thunder rumbling) - [Alex] The spookiest basement I've ever seen in my life! - Exactly. You enter a haunted house, you cling to the ones you love. It was all meant to bring the family back together. And it worked. On paper. And I know what I did was mostly inexcusable. - Come on dad, I get it. You want us back together and you tried the only way you knew how, with words. (dreadful music) - John, what are you doing here? - Mom, you'd never understand. - Try me. - Dad loves you! - Dad loves himself! And I deserve better than that. Excuse me. - Something just dawned on me. - Oh really, what's that? - You'll never be good enough for my father! (stormy music) (engine rumbling) (heavy thudding) (tires squealing) Jess, that blasted bike. (dreadful music) (ticking) Mom, help! - Alex, what's going on? Oh dear Lord! Someone call 911! John! Our little girl! - Oh no, no no no! - [Mom] She's been hit! (dramatic music) No, you're hurting her! (sirens wailing) What if it's her neck, her back? - Get the first aid kit under the sink. - [Mom] Oh, you're hurting her! (drawn-out music) - That's for making mom cry last night. - I'm gonna make you cry in two seconds! (sad music) (Alex sniffles) - [John] We'll have to turn her over. (torn music) (ticking) (moves into heavenly music) (Jessica squealing) (mom sniffling) - This is a cat. See his little whiskers right there? Look at his pointy ears. Look at his fluffy little paws! (aching music) - [Christina VOICEOVER] A purse. - [Alex VOICEOVER] Purse? - Her purse lying on the asphalt. Something that I gave her was sticking out of the top. - What was it? Here's something for you, kiddo. - [Jessica VOICEOVER] You know what? - [Mom VOICEOVER] What? - [Jessica VOICEOVER] I don't think Alex really cares anything about God. (catastrophic music) (wind chimes jingling) - You got it, you got it. Come on, baby. - Come on, Jess. Come on. - Dear Lord. I've tried it my way. Now I trust in yours. (soaring music) (wind chimes clinking) - Please. - [John] Hey, hey. - Hi, daddy. - You did great, pumpkin. (laughs) Hey baby, how are you? It's a miracle. (resolute music) (doorbell rings) - I'm not good at saying goodbye. - [Christina] Let's not say it then. - You were the best thing that happened to me this summer. - That sounds like a line from a movie. - (laughs) Probably is, but I mean it. (cellphone dings) Getting a text. 304-555-5232. Somebody's phone number? - Oh gee, what a coincidence. - What's that? - That phone number, it's the same as mine. (Christina laughs) - [Willy] You're gonna miss your flight, girl! - Oh, I best be going. - Oh hey, Christina. I still got something of yours. - What is it? The deal was for five days and it's only been three. - I know, Christina. Just look at it. (proud music) - Really? - Really. It was kind of tricky to open, but I'm glad that I did. Since I read it and I did what it said, guess I don't need it anymore. He did something for me. - You got saved. - Yeah Christina, I got saved. - He's kinda good like that. - [Willy] You're gonna miss your flight! - I gotta go. (resolute music) - Daddy? - What's that, sweet pea? - Does your story have a happy ending? - Do you know sign language? - What? - Raise your thumb. Then raise your other thumb. See that, sweetie? That right there says it all. (sentimental music) - What's this? - [John] Little advance from my publisher. (touching music) Honey, are these glasses too big for my face? - No. Why would you say something like that? - Maybe 'cause it's true. (Jessica laughs) I can't wait to be home. - Our real home. - See, what's better than family? - [Alex] Family and a big house. - Alex, what's wrong with this house? - Besides the size and the smell, I guess nothing really. - Who needs a big house when we have each other? - (laughs) Yeah, Alex. Maybe you and Christina can have a big house someday. - After the proper ceremonies of course. - Right. Like she's ever gonna remember me. - Oh trust me, she will. - That's right, nothing but a stud muffin. - (laughs) Yeah, and I have the picture right here to prove it. - Really? Let me see it. Jessica! If you send it, I swear I'll tear your ears off! - Gee Alex, I can't believe you don't trust me! - Exactly! - It's not like I'm gonna push any old button and uh... (beeping) - [Alex] What? You didn't do it, did you? - Um. - Jessica, say something for Pete's sake! - Okay.
