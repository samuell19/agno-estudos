Woah! Mamma mia! Che bella ragazza! Wanna ride in my Cabriolet? Hey! Where you going? What's this guy doing? What the hell? You wanna cross in front of me like that? It was on red! I don't give a shit if it was on red! You're lucky I'm in a good mood. Move it. Come on, move! Move! Houari's winning. Hi, guys. Hey! Houari! Cahuète and I are up there. Come up. You came just to say that? I'm in the middle of a game! OK. Alright, here we go! -400 francs! -Look! Alright. Come on! 200 francs! -You're gonna lose. -Good luck. -200 francs. -200 francs! Go on, let's see. Go on, your turn. Cahuète, you were right. I shouldn't have gone back. They ripped me off! -They took every last cent. -Chill out. -You'll get it back! -My mom needs money. Mine too. Get in the middle. Can you believe that? I'm gambling to pay for food shopping. Let's go. What's up? We're not going to a funeral! We're trying to focus, Houari! You always save our asses. How much are we gonna get? Can't you do it for free? For a friend? -"Free." -Houari, get off the seats! -You know how much this cost? -Would you rather I didn't come? Chill out Houari, we're trying to focus here. Five in a car., discreet! -There's no room, move! -Where to? You're a pain in the ass! You want me to buy you a car? Is that it? Seriously guys, let's calm down. We're not going to the circus. This is business, so stop it. -We can't focus like this. -Talk about getting off to a good start! -Hi. -Hi, how are you doing? All good? Yeah, yeah. -We good? Six boxes? -Yeah, yeah. -You got the money? -Yeah, of course. We good? -Thanks, gentlemen. Bye. -Let's go. You have any issues, come see us, passage de Lorette. We're always there. No problem. Why did you tell them that? Seriously Houari, why did you tell them where we live? You might as well have left your number! You're right. I messed that up. You scammed him so good I believed you. You thought there were tape players in those boxes? If I said it was a mop to clean up the shit you just got us in you would've believed it. You're a moron, Houari. No way. Assholes! I'm reporting them to the police! Where are you going at this hour? Reeking of perfume like a woman! You should be ashamed! You think you're a man, but you're not. Real men work! I've done 12 construction apprenticeships. There's no work! Only odd jobs. If you stayed in school, you'd have qualifications! I'm telling you, not even doctors with qualifications have work right now. So don't start going on about qualifications. Listen to this one! Even doctors! It's nothing to do with him. Look at yourself. You're a piece of shit! Worthless! Are you done? Can I go now? You gonna let me leave? Don't tell me you're going to work? That's right. I have work. We don't have the same schedule. Yeah, yeah. Get out! Go out with the rest of the riffraff! Go on, go! -What are you doing here? -You've got some nerve! I haven't heard from you in two days. If you don't want to see me, tell me. That's not it. I'm just busy. I haven't stopped. I'm doing jobs all over the place. I just finished redoing some pipework. See? -Where are you going now? -To do another bathroom. And what's this? Your new work uniform? You're pathetic. You think I'm an idiot? You're off to see your whores smelling like a perfumery. Off you go! -What's wrong, Soraya? -Nothing. I'll tell you later. Leave it, he's playing you. -Don't worry. -Shut your mouth! -Wait. -Let go of me. Nice one, Soraya. Bunch of tramps! Shut your mouths. Alright, guys? -Cops! -Oh shit! Let's go to the club. Even at night they're out. They never sleep! Are they coming over? I got held up, that's why I'm late. My dad's on my case, he won't leave me alone. Then on the way here I saw Soraya. We got in a pretty messy fight. I think it really is over this time. Really? Don't worry, bro. She's got a thing for you, that one. -I don't know. -A quick phone call and you're sorted. Let's go and spend that money we made. He's right. Let's go guys! Else we'll never get in the club. Especially you. It's been a while since you went out. So? Santino? Can you get us in? I'll go inside then I'll be back. I'll go and look for the guy. You don't need a club, you have Houari's shirt. We're counting on you! Woah! Calm down, bro. Get a room! He's going for it, this one. -He's dribbling. -It's a resuscitation. Let her breathe! -Houari, you ready? -Try and stop me! We won't even get in. What's this guy's deal? He can't stand still. -Give it up, guys. -What? You won't get in. You know this guy? Bruce Lee's son? -You making fun of my look? -Or maybe Brando! Please! He looks like a joker. Listen up. For 100 francs each, I'll get all of you in. -What? Are you sure? -Positive. -You'll get us in? -I'm telling you. -No problems? -No problems! -Shall we? -Up to you guys. -OK. -Yeah, OK. -Yeah. -OK. Let's go. -Tell me… -Your face! You got in with them then? You need to get it right first time. After that, they trust you. You're in with the big dogs! It's not that great, I'm telling you. Don't worry. I'll pay for this trip. We'll go to the islands! -It's gonna be awesome! -We'll see. That's not important. We'll see about that later. Yeah. -Come see us in the week. -You killed me there! -I know. -Your face! -Did you see? -I almost didn't recognize you. -Ciao! See you around. -See you. -Take care! -Go and dance! Don't worry, we're gonna have fun! In one match, I took the ball and I dribbled past the whole team. The referee was in the middle and I kicked it right over his head. Then the guy in goal, I felt kinda bad but… I shot him. It happens. Let's move on somewhere. You're all gorgeous. Come on, after you. -I don't have the time. -We'll have to see. -Alright, guys? -Here they are. -You alright? Houari? -You alright? Smile! It's free. Alright, Houari? -Hi, Kakou. -How are you doing? "Hi, Kakou." Where were you last night? We looked everywhere for you! -We were late. -Late? The second you have a better plan you forget about your friends. So you're a traitor? You don't call your friends anymore? -Merlin's looking for you. -Seriously? You didn't tell him I'm here did you? I owe him money. Didn't I tell you? I knew there was something up. So you're avoiding us? I told you! Didn't I tell you? No. I just had some things to settle fast. -What's going on? -We don't even know! Quit messing around and tell us! We're meant to be in this together. If it had been big we wouldn't have left you behind. -Yes you would have! -No question! To be honest guys, you've disappointed me. We have an emergency and right away you get mad? Give us some space! Don't be assholes! If we hadn't figured you out we'd be the ones looking stupid. -Why? -Come and get a drink. I don't like this. You know what? I'll buy you a drink. What will it be? My glass is half full, Fouad. Seeing as it's a kind gesture I'll have the same again. -Usual. -Two strawberry milkshakes. And a mint syrup. Kikou, will you bring them out? Sauveur… look. It's not him, he was shorter. He had short hair. You've been saying that for an hour. Are you gonna find him or not? They've all got short hair. Hey! Where are you going? Where are you going? Is this a joke? Making us run around like idiots. Do you think we're stupid? You're worse than the cops. What cops? Come on, let's just go. The cops! -Oh no, who is it? -I'll go and see. Don't go. You promised to stay with me. I need to go and see. You never know. Hello? Don't show your face today. The video guy's going round with the cops. Customer service! OK, thanks for telling me. Wait, someone wants a word. Don't freak him out, he'll change his mind. Cahuète? How's it going? Listen, you're not going to back out are you? Are we still on? I don't know. Find some cash. What cash? I haven't got a cent. What? You've blown it all already? I haven't blown it, but seeing as you said you had another plan I paid off my debts. We'll do the thing this week, then you're on your own. OK, we'll figure it out. I'll put Houari on. Cahuète, don't take it badly. He needs it. He's not the only one, Cahuète. We need money, Cahuète. OK? Alright. Ciao! OK, let's go back. You know, none of them can resist me! Wait, show me what her tits are like. They were like this! Honestly. Woah! Sylvie, Nathalie, Béatrice? The way you're talking they must be pretty hot! Even their names are making my dick hard. They are hot. The tall one with the big tits is my girl. -Alright bro? -Don't "bro" me. -Every man for himself! -He's right! Is that how it is? I bring you girls and you try to steal mine? Maybe I won't introduce you. -Don't worry, you have your brunette! -We're kidding. Yeah. Fouad? -What is it? -Come and have something to eat! I don't have time, I have stuff to do. Save some for tonight! Alright, son. Do you have the key? No, I forgot it. Just knock when you're home, like you normally do. I won't be home tonight. Don't wait for me, eat. Be careful, son. I will amma! I don't know what's up with her these days. She never sleeps! What about you? You're never home. We hardly see your mom anymore. It's just that she hasn't been well. Are you ashamed of her? What are you talking about? You think I'm ashamed of my mom? I don't know. The way she talks, Her clothes, the way she walks. I don't know. She's like that because she's alone, that's all. Come on, let's get going. -Chri, you're 25 right? -And? Why don't you apply for welfare? You can now! I'm don't want people calling me a leech. So ask for disability, that way you're safe. Do you think I'm crazy or something? Go to hell! I've been trying to help you for the last two hours! Why don't you ask for welfare? You're joking? I've missed five meetings. I was too ashamed. I don't know how everyone does it. Five meetings for what? Welfare or disability? Hi! -Hey! -We're going to miss them! Don't worry, you'll get to see your brunette. You're losing your mind about these girls. Chill out. -Which one did you put on? -Are you stupid? The real one. -The real one is that one. Two minutes. -Shaving's a nightmare. Why do you need a mirror for aftershave? -Two minutes! -Move! Have you got a cold or something? You're swimming in it. You need to straighten that hair! Look! What the hell's that? You've been wearing those this whole time? -Are you nuts? -They'll run a mile! -Alright, Robinson Crusoe. -Did you make them yourself? Hold on to them, they'll run away! Pair of assholes! Seriously, loafers? All this talk about reputation. -Honestly… -You missed a bit. -Just there. -Where? -Here, I'll do it. -No, get off. -Just tell me… -There. -It's important. -What are we gonna do with him? Reputation's important. People know us in Marseille. If we go to the Canebière, he's not coming with those shoes. -I'll sort him out. -I swear to you. Sometimes you're the same, you know. -You know. -Did you just slap me? I'm sorry about that. Let me live my life. Do you remember? I'm going. Go on. Leave me alone. Let me breathe. -Hurry up! They'll leave. -Alright bro. Let me live my life Let me live… My life! Holy shit, you're hot! Don't worry, I'll call you. No worries. What's he doing here? I told him never to come back. I came to get clothes for tonight. Who are you talking to? Clothes? What clothes? Nothing, a couple of things Grandpa left me. Go to hell, you and your clothes! I never want to see your ugly face again! They say I look like you. Say that again and I'll get the gun. Now get out! The problem is my dad's the biggest asshole on earth! That's what's wrong with me. I've had it with you. After what he did, I'll never get back with him. -What did he do this time? -I don't remember, more bullshit. -Haven't you heard from him? -I don't want to. I'm focusing on my studies. It's the only way. When we were together, we never saw each other. -It was as if I was single. -You're doing the right thing, leaving. My boyfriend left me. Even though I made him meatballs. He loved them but he still left me. Sandra, you've been thinking about him for way too long. You're stuck on him. I almost reported him for non-assistance when he left. I was about to lose it. You know how it is. All the things he said about love, that's what hurt the most. Listen, girl. Get out and move your ass, and soon they'll all be whispering sweet nothings. -We're here! -Are you sure? Yeah! -Is this your room? -No. It's my little brother's. It's hot. I'm gonna take off my shirt. -Don't you wanna take yours off? -Are you nuts? I'm joking! I hope so. Nice wallpaper you got there. -It's ten years old. -Oh right. -How old's your little brother? -Ten. It's ten years old and so is your brother. -That's why we moved. -So he was born here. Really nice wallpaper. Your friend's place is nice! -Yeah it's not bad. -Yeah. I wanted to tell you. You remind me of a girl. When I was little, I was crazy about her. I can't even explain it's so… Honestly, ever since last time… Since last time I… Anyway, I have something important to tell you. I'm crazy about… look. I'm crazy about stars. You see just next to the big dipper? -Hm? -That's the Great Bear. You know your stuff! Ever since I was little, I've always liked looking at the stars. I'm fascinated by them. Just like you. So you're saying I'm like a star? Yes, even better than a star. -Shall we make a wish? -Alright! I don't know. I wish we could go to a desert island. What do you think of me, you think I'm sure of myself? Really, I'm a little angel. -Really? -I swear! I didn't imagine you'd be like this. You're even more beautiful. Thanks, that's nice. And what did your friend say about me? -He said you're a great girl. -He told me you were great too. -Wanna show me your room? -Are you tired? -I wanna hit the hay with you. -You don't waste your time. I'm not interested in that lovey dovey stuff. I'm too old. You think I'm easy? Yeah that's it! Harder! Bastard! Asshole! Fucker! OK stop! You've been insulting me for two hours! -Sorry. -You think I'm a fag or something? -OK! -Wash your mouth out, you slut! Who the hell am I fucking, here? A broken tape player? -Sylvie… -What? His friend didn't even kiss me. He just said "suck my dick". Come on. -Hey. -You're a dick! Christian, what have you done? That's no how you do it! Be a gentleman! -Are you nuts! -Why didn't you kiss her? Her breath stinks! Really? Get out, all of you! Happy now? It's always the same with you. This poor guy spent three days putting all this together and you ruin it just like that? -Leave it… -Let me take care of things in future. It's over! -It all started fine! -You think? No way are you staying. Get out! Come on guys, they're playing us. I'm trying to apologize, she won't listen! Guys, seriously, I'm in love with this girl. What? She votes far-right! What are you talking about? She loves me. What? It was her friend who told me! Swear? Wallah, na'adine, her friend told me! -It's nothing against you. -So who are you against? -All the others. -What others? We're all here! I don't understand. I love you, I'm sure of it. It's because her mom got attacked recently. Fouad and I are leaving. What are you doing, bro? Coming. In football, this is what's called an obstruction. Lock the door, darling. Guys. Did you see that? You see what that asshole just did? What? It's always the same. Every time I leave our district someone ends up ruining the night. Bunch of fascists! They're full of hate, you can see it in their faces. Leave it, you can see he's an asshole. What are you doing? No. I always let it go. I've had enough now. Does he think I just got off the boat? If there's one thing I'm sure of, I was born here! -I'm from Marseille! -Alright, that's enough. Let's go! -Come on. -You're making a scene! How do you think I feel? If I don't wear a suit, I get called a wop. Just like they called my Grandpa. He didn't speak good French. You know what? I'm sick of hearing about this night. Do me a favor and let's get out of here. What? Did anything good ever happen to you round here? Just leave it now. I don't give a shit. Sick of these nights. Fuck! It's so grim. There's nothing to do. There's nothing for us in this country. The land of bread and all we get is pain. It's not made for us. Are you two moaning again? What's wrong with you? Move your ass! You're been dicking around for 20 years. What do you even do? Nothing! Nada! Your ass is stuck to the chair like a magnet. "Marseille is shit, there's nothing to do…" "It's so grim, nothing to do, they're all assholes…" Give it a rest! Fuck! Go kill yourself if there's nothing to do. Be an example! Be the first to go! You see me complaining? What do you say? Why's he in such a hurry? -I don't get it. -Why's he talking to me like that? What's the problem? Let's see! Let's see that. -Why did he only say it to me? -You hiding something? Are you serious? Oh! Dante… Dante's Inferno! Bro, you've really lost it. You must be the only person who's ever bought this book. Look how many pages! Not one picture. You know what this moron said to me? I said: "Use the word 'fascinate' in a sentence." He said: "He's gotten so fat… he can only fasten eight buttons"! -He said that? -On my account. -Are you taking the piss? -It's good to think outside the box! You think I don't know what it means? -I was kidding! -I know, Kakou. -Am I not allowed to make a joke? -I was kidding! No you're not. Nor is he! -Where you going? -Shut it, hobo! -What have you been saying? -You're leaving us? You can't do that! Haven't you got any ideas? Why don't you move your ass? Why are you talking like that? -What kind of idea? -To make some money! Come on. Kader, how's it going bro? Alright, Kader ? We need your help. Every time I see you, you ask me for a favor. Don't, you're making me feel bad. We're gonna go to my sister's. We'll get the TV and the stereo, and we'll come back. That's all. Make yourself useful! 20 years you've been sitting around doing nothing. -Let's go. -Get in the back. -Come on, move it! -Fuck! You wanna just do a random house? Hurry up, else he'll catch on. Catch on? I know what's going on. What do you know? We're going to his sister's, I get it. We'll take the first house. Nice place! What's up? Fuck, I forgot the keys! Kader, listen. In your toolbox, have you got a crowbar or something? -I don't know. -I'll check. Be right back. -Go on. -I swear Kader, you're the best. Nice one! Now I feel bad for him. He said yes straight away. He can't say no. You gonna do it in front of him? Houari, are you going to break it down? Nice one! Woah! Hold this, I'll kick the bottom. -You're gonna break it down! -Shut up! What's going on? I heard something. Go on! You've woken them up! There's a weird sound, like an animal! There's something behind the door! -I swear… -What is it? I must have got the wrong door. They all look the same. Where does your sister live? Quit messing. I think it's upstairs. Yeah, she lives upstairs! Let's go. You don't look like your grandpa, Houari! Really? Look at the nose, ears, eyes. I'm the spitting image! Yeah you're right. -You look the same. -See? Stop it! Is that what you're here for? It's not a flea market! -There's nothing. -I don't need any more sweaters. Houari! Is your sister married to a CEO? A surgeon! Kader saw the picture of Napoleon, and asked if it was my grandpa! You've got a nose for poverty. There's not a franc in this place! What's that supposed to mean? You come with me, you take the risk. -It's pure luck. -You take risks for nothing? So don't come next time! Don't come! Stop shouting, someone will hear us. Kader! Let's go. It's not my fault I can't find what my sister asked for. How's your sister going to clean up the mess? What mess? It's a total mess! There's not a single franc here. Nothing. What's that? Thanks to you, I've been to hospital three times this year! It's getting harder to work. Now I get it. Once I was with my cousin and we broke the door down. I got something in my eyes. I don't know what it was. -It's bullshit, the things they do. -It's too dangerous. There's not even anything to take from these bums. Next time we'll go to poor people's houses. Ah! Now I get it! Get what? Going through your sister's fridge! You can't do that! Shut it! -You're sure he didn't hit him? -Sure! -Hey, guys! -Cahuète got busted by the cops! What? -On my mom's life! -Where? I just told them. Five or ten minutes ago. -Was he walking? -Yeah. They were behind him. He was coming down that way. In a Renault 21 wagon. You seen those things turn? I'm the only one who saw. If he doesn't do anything stupid, he'll be out in two days. First offense. -Right. -For sure. And you can tell he's not a murderer. I swear, there's no justice. Are you nuts? If they want to lock him up tomorrow, they'll lock him up. You know how it works. I swear, that's how it is. The prosecutor decides, not the cops. Not for something like that. One day, me and Cahuète, were doing this project for kids in jail. This photographer came, I don't know where from. He got 20 francs and we got nothing. Can you believe it? -No! -You think that's OK? They want us to stay in the shit all our lives! But we're gonna show them how guys like us bounce back! They won't be at the top forever! You know who the real thugs are? Those crooks who stayed in school. They know about forms and shit. So they get away with it! But this is Cahuète. Everyone knows, but no one does anything. When it's us, they call the cops. -Yeah! -Right. It's true! Did you see Rachid's car? -That guy's a low-life! -What's it got to do with him? -What are you going on about Rachid for? -This is about Cahuète. -Stop talking shit. -I don't know what gets into you. -Go take your meds -It's not only Rachid! Pilou and Zec are the same! You think Zec earns that money? All those cars he has… come back! We have to do something. They don't get it. Zec and Pilou are loaded! They don't get it. You and your little friends snatched his bag, outside the post office. Didn't you? It's not true. I've never seen him before. Are you saying Mr. Abdou is lying? That he made the whole thing up? He's mixed me up with someone else, that's all. You wanna play the smart guy? You wanna get locked up? What's prison to guys like you? It's a bargain! You get fed, roof over your head. You even get a TV! You'll be with other slackers like you! The three dots on your face, is it a gang tattoo? They're just freckles. How am I meant to respect you? -What are you saying? -I didn't say anything. So who was with you? We'll talk more afterwards. You'll tell the truth. With me where? I don't understand. I was with my girlfriend all week, I didn't go out. I've told you twice. We always end up finding guys like you. It's our job. And to make your life impossible. Whatever you do, wherever you go, you're thinking: "He's there, that bastard. He's following me, watching me." I'm sorry, officer. I don't know what you mean. I hear you. If I knew something, I'd say. I'd co-operate. I swear! Go ahead. Laugh while you still can. What are you doing? He wanted to shoot me! Sit down! Don't move! Is it him making a racket? Sit down! Sit where? Sit down. You shut your mouth. Take him away. I've had enough. That's right. Look at me. Take a good look! What's up? It's Cahuète. He was supposed to come over. He promised. I haven't heard from him. I'm worried. Let me explain. Yesterday, I was with him. The cops asked for our IDs. He didn't have his. They took him in. -No! -Don't worry! -They're not keeping him in? -You'll see him tomorrow! Otherwise I'll get him out myself! Go home and get some sleep. -Do me a favor. Go home. -I can't do this anymore. If they let him out, even if it's late, tell him to call me. I promise, OK? -You'll call me? -Yes. Go home. -I'm counting on you. -Don't stay here. -OK, thanks, Houari. Ciao. -Go on. Ciao. Oh! You scared me. Are you the girl from Bosnia? Yes. I'm Giana. Is it nice, Bosnia? I heard there was a war. -You heard but you haven't seen it. -Right. I don't have a TV. Why are you sleeping here? It's like Bosnia in my dad's house! I like you. You're nice. Yeah? Do you want to eat in our camp? -Won't your family mind? -No. I'll tell them your dad's like Bosnia. Thanks, but I'm not hungry right now. -I'll eat for you, too. -OK. Thanks for coming to visit. See you! -Bye! -See you around. Bye. Oh, Kader! -Look at you! -Where are you going? -Nice to see you! -It's tailored! Some advice for you bro: there are other girls aside from whores. Whores? I'm going to see my girlfriend! -You have a girlfriend? -She's your girlfriend now! -What? -How much? 20,000? 30? 40? It's me getting laid, not you! OK, but at least tell us how much she costs! It's me getting laid, not you! -What have you done to it? -What? -Is it leaking? -Is it gas? -Come and see! -Where's it leaking? -Look! There! -Where? Don't you see the hole? Come here, have a look! I don't believe it! Take a look! Assholes! Bastards! Bring my car back! That's my car! It's got a leak because of you! Come back! Nice one guys, the tank's full! Nice! Let's go see my uncle. He'll give me some cash. -Right? Easy. -Let's go. -Let's go. -Christian's up for anything. Of course he is. He'll follow us to the end of the earth. This is Marseille. We always go to the same old places! Where we go it's not like this. We think nothing's going on. You come into the city and it's crazy. This is where everyone is. -In the city? -This is where shit happens. Where else is there, anyway? Be quick! He's there. I'll be two minutes. -Quick! -Move it! -Don't worry. -Don't worry. I hope he gets it. They don't look happy. With their little glasses of coffee. He's shaking his head. It doesn't look good. Gutted. -Fuck. -What? We good? No. Let's get out of here. He hasn't got his pension yet. He only had 50 francs and he wanted to give it to me. -I didn't take it. -You did the right thing! Yeah, it didn't feel right. Normally you don't have to ask. No. When they have cash they give it to us. Yeah, no questions asked! They just stick it in your hand. They're good like that, old folks. They've already lived! I don't believe it. -Bambini -What are you doing here? -We're eating, what does it look like? -At 11.30 at night? Where did you get the money for all that? It's not the first time we've done it. You find her in an orphanage? I met her on the street. -I don't believe it! Look at that! -Give it back! It's not mine. -Where did you get that? -Give it! -That's a week's wages! -Calm down. -Look at all that! -Someone lent it to me. -Someone lent it to them. -How did you get it? -Get off! Give it back! -Come on, let's go! Alright! What are you doing, guys? -Come on, they're just kids. -Did you think I was going to rob them? Did you see that wad of cash? I don't believe it! Leave them alone. What are you doing? They're kids. You've been there too. See how fast they run? Like lightning, these kids! What would you have done with it? Seriously, Brahim? I wasn't going to take it. That's not what they thought. They're just kids. I'm not that broke! Why are you talking like that? Stop. You think I'm gonna take their cash? They're kids, they don't think like us. -I didn't want to scare them. -I know. It's fine. If I see them in the neighborhood they'll get a slap! You think they'll come to our neighborhood? They live here, they're getting by just fine. They're independent! You think they're not like us? If they do it to the wrong person, they're screwed. You're right about that. You'll see. Let's go. They didn't come back. What about Kader? He'll be losing it. -Kader's gonna be mad! -He's gonna lose it. He'll never trust us again! -We'll explain. -You know what I'm scared of? I'm scared he'll really flip. He's dangerous. -Yeah. -We'll figure it out. No, no. -He gets it. -We'll work it out. Two nice-looking girls. -Stop! -Well spotted, Christian! Good evening, ladies! We're looking for a restaurant, Chez Bousbous? -Know it? -They think they're stars. -No, we don't know it. Sorry. -Bye. Why don't you get out? -They smiled at us! did you see? -In your dreams. Let me handle it. Do me a favor. You know what? -Kakou… -Shut your mouth! Sorry ladies. Someone told us we were gonna meet two lovely ladies. -Of course. -No, really! Wait up! No, really! I'm serious! Come on, we just want to talk to you. Stop stuttering! Come on, don't you want to go for a mint tea? No thanks, our friends are waiting. You're gorgeous! Hey! Come back! You hear this guy? We missed out on two cute girls. You don't help things. You're not helping. Alright, we get it. Leave me alone! Guys! He's hitting her! He's going to kill her! What do we do? -What did you do to my brother? -Let me go! What are you doing? Let go! Let go! What are you doing? -Leave it! -Let me go! -Leave it. -Let me go. Sophia? What are you doing here? What have you done? -What have you done? -Come on, we'll take you back. -Come on, let's go home. -No, I don't want to. No. -He's gone. -Where is he? -He's gone, he's gone. -Phil! Phil! Get out of here! Go! Let me go! Where is he? Where is he? Philippe! Philippe! Thank God. He didn't hit her. Don't you know what he's like? I swear he was dragging her around! I didn't recognize her! Shit! Did you see how she's changed? So different… Shit, I can't believe it. HALFWAY ALONG THE JOURNEY OF LIFE You know what, guys? A long time ago, this guy came to mine. He knocked on the door. He said to my mom: "I'm selling tickets for a show." "There's gonna be a big party in the neighborhood today." I begged my mom to get me a ticket. She did. As he was leaving the guy said it was a circus or something. It was starting in one hour. I went out in the neighborhood. There was no one there. I stayed out until night. I thought I could hear music, people passing by. I thought the show was starting. But it was just my mom telling me to come back. As usual. I don't know what's going on with my life. Everything's going wrong. Things never get better. There's too much going on around me. Inside me as well. When people look at me, when they talk to me, my face changes, my hands ball up into fists. Why am I like this? Seriously, can you tell me why? It's so cold! It's like winter! Guys, we should get back. Look at that. Look! If you're looking for girls, just ask. No problem. If I want my money, do I just ask for that, too? I told you, you'll have it in one week. So what about these girls? Don't you wanna introduce us to your sister? He's joking, my friend. Or maybe your 12-year-old niece? Watch your mouth, Santino! I'm being polite with you and you talk to me like a bunch of morons. Have I done something? Didn't you hear what the moron said? You're going to give him the money you borrowed from the bank of You and Us. Do you know Marcel? -Do you know Doumé? -Yeah. I know Marius, too. Now, you fucking asshole, if you can get me my money, I'd be much obliged. Alright, I see. Don't go anywhere just yet. We know you have nothing. This is called taking us for a ride. We good? Have a good evening. He said he knows Doumé? He doesn't know anyone, I did some digging. -What did he come here for? -You know what. Now we've settled all our scores, and practically become an institution, we've been consigned to oblivion. Now this little joker's come and dragged us back out again. It's not about the money any more, it's the principle. Only you can decide what's best. We're all behind you. Whatever you say. We're behind you. Right. Cheers! How much longer is this going to go on? There was a time when I could have done anything. But now, can you imagine me being a politician or something like that? Selling crap to gullible people? Screwing people over to earn an 'honest' living? If that's honesty, I'll stick to being dishonest. Because whether I'm a politician or a bum, they'll always say I'm a con artist. At the end of our day, our problem is that we need to learn to screw people over without suffering. When we've chosen someone for our rip-off, it's because we recognized them as a good person. Aside from sleeping and sitting around on benches, you can't do anything. It wasn't me who built the benches. Even if I sit my ass on them from time to time. I was born here. I had no choice. My friends are the only people I have. Go through it. Anything inside? -That's it. -I almost died for this? Go on, take it all. Crazy woman! She almost killed me! My ears won't stop ringing. Don't worry, it'll stop. You're OK, all things considered. Come on, let's go. Have you seen Albert around? No I haven't seen him for a while. Why, did you mess up? He's the only one who can help me out. How much do you need? A lot. I can't help you. It's vacation time, they're all at the beach. -I can't do anything. -I understand, I'll work something out. If you see him, tell him to call me. -OK? -I promise, Tino. -Thanks. -Ciao. Grandma? Hi, it's me. -Did anyone call? -No. I was lying down all day. On the sofa. No one called. If someone calls, what should I say? No, don't worry. I'll take care of it. I forgot which day they were calling. Everything alright at home? Did the helper come over? Yes, she came. She doesn't talk too much, she's very nice -and she does a good job. -That's good news. -Wait, Tino. -Yeah. I want you to take care of yourself. -Don't start! -You're not a bad boy. I know you're not. I just want you to be OK. I worry a lot about you. I know, don't worry, I am careful. I won't be home late. Can you make me a shopping list? There's nothing in. -Yes. -Love you. -He's back! -How's it going? My God! -You alright? -We were worried about you! So what happened? We don't wanna end up there, that's all I'll say. I was worried about you. Was it okay? The guy we scammed told the cops I stole his bag. Really? We did a clean job and this guy's playing dirty! I can't believe it. Let's go and see Sauveur. He's done his basement up. -We haven't seen him for two days. -Two days is rare for him. Oh, Cahuète, it's good to see you! Two days without you. Shit, it's good to see you! You okay? -What's going on? -My second home! You got a bad leg? Let's go to the living room. He's got it sorted, this guy! He's all sorted. Everything's fine. The only thing is there's too much noise. I feel like the cars are driving right next to my bed. -Have you seen where you live? -You're not at your mama's anymore. Apart from that, Cahuète, you OK? Yeah but two days is a long time. Shit! We didn't even realize. -Didn't see the time go by. -You had a close shave! And you survived! Just like this one! Ah, it's nothing. It'll take a while to get your head back to normal! Don't worry! -Cahuète, what's up? -You seem a bit off. Nothing. It's just really grim in there. And that wasn't even prison. Yeah? Seriously. Good thing I denied everything. Otherwise I wouldn't be here. Yeah. I'm serious. Now it's just his word against mine. It's gonna be alright. OK, let's change the subject. You gonna let us use your second home? You wanna fuck with me? I'm gonna fuck with you. Only the mountains never meet. What did you do with the cash? How'd you spend that much? Let me finish him! -You're gonna end up on the scrap heap! -Wait! Leave him. Come on! Come on! You put the money in there? Little bitch! Guys… -What? -Sounds like a guy hitting something. -What's going on? -Sounds like something's up. See your car? Do you see it? If we don't have the money in a week, it'll be your face next. I'll manage. -Understand? -Yeah. We can't let him do that! -I should have known. -It'll be alright. What did you do with the drugs? If you didn't sell them? You take them? This isn't my fault. You got yourself in the shit. Come on guys, we have to do something. They're gone, there's nothing we can do. I'll go talk to him. Go round the back. He can't see us all together. Be careful! -I had an accident. -How did you do that? Some asshole cut me up! I went into the wall. -Come to the fountain. You're bleeding. -I'm OK! -I'm tired. -You need to clean up. I want to go home. Stop fucking around. You don't need them to sort yourself out. Let them have all that. The jewelry, the cars. You're right. We don't care about that. Give them what you owe, then take it easy. See you tomorrow. 80,000 FRANCS What's wrong? I wanted to get you alone to tell you. My parents just got back from the hospital. Fouad's mom was taken in. -She passed away. -What do you mean? Heart attack. They couldn't do anything. -Fouad's mom's dead? -Yes. Does he know about it? My dad was the one who told him. He tried to blame the doctors, said it was their fault. That they could have saved her. My dad told him it was too late. She was dead on arrival. Yeah. Tomorrow they're doing a fund so she can be buried back home. My dad's sorting it out. I can't believe it. Fouad's mom is dead. Sauveur! Sauveur! Giana? What are you doing here? I'm here to see you. My parents said we're leaving soon. Where are you going? Away from France. Do you want to come? Thank you, but I can't just leave like that. I'll think about it. Here. It's from our country. Oh wow. Thank you. I promise I'll eat it when I'm hungry. Thank you. Now you have to go home. Children shouldn't be out at this hour. Did you see what just happened out there? Please, go home. OK. Mom! Ready? Lift! … everyone there, got it? -You alright? -Alright. Did you ever think he'd do something like that? I bet even he didn't know right until the last minute. I can't believe we won't see him again. We won't even hear him speak again. I'm going home, guys. -OK. -You going? Yeah, see you later. Whenever you get mad, there's always someone there to make sure you shut your mouth. Forever. I heard the news. -Yeah? -It's disgusting. What got into him, going there alone? It was doomed from the start. It's an electronic bank, not a jewelry store. Come on! -Come on! -Hurry up guys! Wait… -They're coming! -Hurry up! Come on, hurry up! -Quick! -Let's go, let's go! -Come on, Houari! -Wait! Allez ! HOUARI WAS HERE NO GUNS NO VIOLENSE Come on, guys! Quick! Quick! My mom's gonna kill me because of you! OK Étienne, let's go! She's gonna kill me! Yep… When we went to Tahar's for kebabs! The shit you pulled that day! And when he got chased by the taxi driver! He said: "I'll give you the taxi". -He didn't have a single franc on him! -Not a single franc. -OK, I have to go, guys. -Where are you going? Where you going? Stay with us, bro! I was with a friend before. But he left me. -Really? -We were going to the port. Asshole! I even got a card to get in. Really? -Shit. -Now I'm on my own. I'm gutted. I could have made so much money. I'll go on my own if I have to. To be honest, it's risky. I need money! I need a roof over my head for summer. You're going there now? Wanna come? There's enough for three. Yeah, we'll go. We just have to go down there. I've got a van and everything we need. When I think about that asshole leaving me. Don't worry. You have us now! Shall we go? Let's go, no problem, let's go. OK. -Ciao, Mich. -Ciao! Fuck! The guards are watching. -Look, he's watching us! -Looks like a Nazi. Forget the guards. We're on our own turf. Thank you. -Let's go! -It's okay, it's okay. Don't worry, there are others. -Finally! -Here we go, guys. -Come on, move it, move it! -We don't have time. Let's make a chain. Let's move it! Here. -Move it, what are you doing? -Chill out, we're the only ones here. Kakou, look what I found! Let go of me! Let go! Alright, let go! Let go! Alright. Call it quits now? "Call it quits"? We'll decide that, not you. Move it, before I change my mind. So, Santino, nice job you did. Tell me, Santino, who did you have to charm? Someone who's pretty rich but pretty stupid. He must be stupid to get ripped off by you. How does a guy like you find people stupid enough to lend you money? I don't know. Is it all there? Cut the wise guy act. You're an asshole. Haven't you had enough? Looks like he didn't learn his lesson. Let's go. Get out of here, you piece of shit. Move out the way. Asshole. Fuck. COCO BEACH: TASTE THE DIFFERENCE -It's a nightmare, this business. -It's like the joke. They guy who works in Hollywood who just has to say: -"The end." -That's all. So everything's set. They ask this guy: "You want a part in a film?" They say, "Give it a try, here's the cash". "Your part's the last line on the last page." "The end!" That's all he has to say. He goes home and says to his wife: "I'm an actor! I'm gonna be in a film!" "Let me go over my lines!" So his wife watches him repeat: "The end!" Then he goes on set. There's Tom Cruise, Sylvester, they're all there. The biggest western ever made. And the director says: "Action!" And out he comes, all excited, and he says: "the end"! You just had to say: "The end!" That's all! At home he could do it! "The end, the end, the end!" Then the lights go on, everyone's standing there, and he goes: "The ond!" Then the director looks at him and says: "That's a wrap!" He's had enough. I have to say. Even in Calabria, the pasta isn't this good. Hats off to the chef! -Bring him out! -Oh no, no need. The main thing is you liked it. Oh, come on! Bring him out, else we'll go in the kitchen! He's gone home. -You want me to go in there? -OK! I've been all over Italy, I've been to every restaurant. Never had a sauce like that. Must be a real Italian, this guy. -Allow me to introduce Ossita. -Hello. Hello. Hello. Very good, the food. Thank you. We're… amazed. Shall I get us a bottle of champagne? No, I have to run. Ciao, Loul! Nice one. Thank you! -I'll bring the family some time. -Any time! Thanks. Ciao! See you, Jojo. Ciao. See you next time. -Take care. -You too. Need a ride? No worries. Let's go. Ciao! -What did you just do? -Nothing! Look. Hold him down! Get off me! Leave him! Get that son of a bitch! -My scooter! -Leave the scooter. Leave it, run! -Get him! -Leave it. Hey! Sauveur, are you there, bro? Sauveur! Shit. … hard. Too hard. Too hard. She hurt me. Too hard. She hurt my head! ROMAIN ROLLAND LTD FOR ALHASSAN AND ALL OUR FRIENDS WHO LEFT US TOO SOON Subtitle translation by: Holly James
