"My bounty is as boundless as the sea, and my love as deep. The more I give to thee, the more I have, for both are infinite." Will you marry me? Wow. That was beautiful and the Shakespeare quote was perfect. Well, I'm not surprised. It was your idea. It's what I do. Now, let's get Emma out here before I say yes to you myself. Our Romeo is ready. And our Juliet has no idea what's coming. Angie, this could be our best on air proposal ever. Places, everyone. Welcome to a very special episode. I met Aaron Scheller when we served together on the board of a local charity. Aaron was the high bidder at the charity's auction, winning a chance to be on The MatchMaker,■ and his match with Emma was perfect. So perfect, that just six months later he's back to propose. Emma thinks she's here to update us on their relationship, no idea that Aaron plans to pop the question. Let's see what Emma's answer will be, right after the break. All my life, I've had the ability to pair people with their perfect match from all over my home town of Philadelphia. Now, I'm taking my skills to you at home. I'm Angie Dove, and I'll find you love right here on The MatchMaker. "The more I give to thee, the more I have, for both are infinite." Will you marry me? Yes. Yes. It's a match! Congratulations. Angie, this was the most awesome episode ever. Thanks, Violet, and I meant to tell you, congratulations on adopting a rescue. How did you know? I haven't told anyone yet. The tennis ball in your purse and the plastic baggie in your pocket were a hint, and that smile on your face and the little white hairs on your shirt either mean a new canine or an old boyfriend. Okay, I see how you got the canine part, but how did you know Ziggy was a rescue? The biggest clue of all. Your heart. I knew you'd want to help a dog without a home. Thanks, Angie. A wildly successful commercial developer and one of the city's most eligible bachelors finds love with a North Philly hair stylist. On behalf of singles everywhere, I commend you. Compliment acknowledged and appreciated. How did you know this couple was meant to be? Shared values, in sync personality types, plus compatible lip shapes, similar sense of humor. Whoa, back up, sensei. Lip shape? Yes, it's just one of many personality indicators. So, a full upper lip suggests a giving person. Thin lips correspond with self-reliance, and a pronounced Cupid's bow often correlates with creativity. There they are. Than you both so much. Without you, Aaron and I would have never even met, let alone fallen in love. After my divorce, the last thing I thought I'd ever want to do is get married again. Emma changed all that. Angie, you've given me another chance and this time I'm gonna get it right. We are throwing a small engagement party at Aaron's place. Sunday, at 2:00. We'd love if both of you could come. We wouldn't miss it. We have a party to plan. Bye. Sorry, they just look like regular lips to me. Dad? Dad? Shouldn't you be restoring that thing in the garage? It's cooler in here. Uh-huh. How's my Angela? Great. I came over to make you a nice steak. Well, it's great timing. I'm out of leftovers. What's the occasion? We had another successful proposal on the show today. Hey, congrats! Thanks. Still, I gotta say, I wish you'd use the family name on TV. Dad, the English translation of Colomba is "dove," which just so happens to rhyme with love. "Angie Dove, I'll find you love." I get it. I get it. To me, you will always be my Angela Colomba. To me, too. What's with all the old files? Well, I asked the chief if I could take a look at some open cases from back in the day. Dad, you're retired. You should be relaxing. You sound like your mother. How is she anyway? Did she find herself yet? As a matter of fact, this week she's presenting a paper at a psychiatry conference in Dallas. Well, that's as good a place to look as any. When are you two gonna work things out? What things? We're very happily married. Living 1,500 miles apart? That's why we're so happy. What's up with what's his name? Isaac. We broke up. I thought his name was Alec. Alec was before Isaac, and we broke up, too. I seem to be better at fixing other people than myself. It may take two to tango, but it's also fine to dance on your own. This is their idea of a small party. So, when you first met Aaron, it never occurred to you to fix him up with your partner in crime, Paige? Bad lip fit. Oh, canapes, thank you. Mm, thank you. Another perfect match. Peach and prosciutto. What are you-- What are you doing? Capturing the ambience for our social media presence. You know what they say. We don't want to intrude. A quick walkthrough. I'll be right back. Emma, you look incredible. I kind of do, don't I? And where's the groom-to-be so I can remind him how lucky he is? He's working if you can believe it, but he's promised to join us very soon. Now, can I ask a favor? Yeah. Aaron and I are writing our own vows, and I would love to get the Angie Dove seal of approval. "A match made in heaven, where one becomes two, and two become one." Emma, these are lovely. I was also hoping to get your advice on something that happened earlier. I'm at a loss a-- Oh, Angie, this is my cousin, Piper, and partner at my salon. Hi. Thanks for everything you've done for Emma. Can we talk for a minute? Yeah. Um, we can talk later? Yeah. Absolutely. Angie Dove, the one person able to get Aaron Scheller back to the altar. Well, I mean, it's not gonna be me up there. I just made the introduction. Yes, Emma. Right place, right time? Right woman. Indeed. I'm Rachel Turner, Chief Operating Officer of Scheller Development, and this is Phillip Price, Chief Financial Officer. Pleasure to meet you. We've never seen Aaron so happy. On behalf of those who love him, thank you. Well. Where is he, anyway? Emma said he was working but that he'll be here soon. His assistant told me he was meeting with Rose Clarke. The attorney? The one and only. She represented Aaron in his divorce. And my ex in mine. Tough? Brutal. I'm still recovering. Why is he seeing a divorce attorney right before his engagement party? Obviously, he's having her draw up a prenuptial agreement. A prenup? I wouldn't think so. Aaron's not the type. He's rich, isn't he? Then he's the type. There goes your week. A prenup requires an assessment of all premarital assets, which means someone from Clarke's office will be going over our books in excruciating detail. I need a drink. I'll join you. Smile! Paige, that's enough ambiance. Here, have a seared scallop. Okay. Mmm. Declan, right? Hi, I'm-- Angie Dove. I know. I've got you to thank for all this. Let's hope my dad has more success with his second family than his first. Uh, Paige, this is Declan, Aaron's son. Look, I've got to go. Wait, what just happened? Declan's had a few rough years. Aaron's been trying to help him get back on his feet. He doesn't seem too happy for dear old Dad. Our cue. Shall we? Yes. To a match made in heaven. There she is! Call 911. There's no pulse. Yes, just waiting to be interviewed. I'm fine, just shaken. Thanks, Dad. I'll keep you posted. Okay, love you, too. You're Angie Dove, aren't you? Yes. Oh, boy. My wife loves your show. Thank you. Officer Lowry. You're next. Right this way, please. Okay. Thank you for your patience. I'm Detective Carter. Name? "Name?" Don't you know who this is? Angie Dove. The MatchMaker from TV. The only thing I watch on TV are the Eagles, so unless you're their new wide receiver, I'm gonna have to plead ignorance. So, what did you see? Well, nothing, really. When I got here, Emma seemed happy, except she did mention wanting advice about something that had happened earlier. Did she tell you what that something was? We were interrupted, then, the next time I saw her was right before she went upstairs. You know, she was checking her phone and looked troubled. What makes you think she was troubled? Well, she slumped a little, and her brow tensed, and she reached up to the back of her neck and shook her head looking down, oh, and she bit her lip, like this. Anything else? No, sorry. It was just for a second or two. Um, this was found at the top of the stairs. Do you recognize that as Emma's? I mean, a phone is a phone, but it's an easy enough thing to check. A-ha. One mystery solved. You wouldn't happen to know her security code, would you? Mm-mm. One more thing. When I reached Emma at the bottom of the stairs, she wasn't wearing her engagement ring. Was she wearing the ring earlier? I can't say I saw it. It's more like I didn't not see it, which I would have if she wasn't. Wearing it, that is. Okay. What can you tell me about her fiancé, Aaron Scheller? Emma said he was working but would be here shortly. And how would you describe their relationship? I'm not sure I understand the question. How did they feel about each other? Were they getting along? It was an engagement party, as in, they'd gotten engaged, and were celebrating with a party. I get the concept, but it's not unusual for engaged couples to fight or argue, is it? Are you suggesting Aaron had something to do with Emma's death? I'm not suggesting anything. I'm investigating. Then let me be as clear as possible. Emma and Aaron were deeply in love and couldn't have been happier. Despite her being troubled, taking off her engagement ring, and Mr. Scheller not being at the party at all. I stand by my answer. Okay. One more thing, did you take any photos at the party? My friend Paige got some video. I'll make sure she turns it over. Paige. Okay, well, thank you, Ms. Dove. You have been exceedingly helpful. You'll need to turn in the video of the party, but could you first send a copy to- Done. Ma'am. Tons of media coverage on the murder, but so far no mention of you or the show. Someone will make the connection. It's just a matter of time. This is awful! Really awful! Hi, Benjamin. My first year with the network, your first season, and this happens. We were a lock to be renewed, but this could kill us! Shouldn't we be a little more concerned about Emma? Totally, absolutely. Our only chance is to lay low and hope no one notices, stay as far away from this as possible! Benjamin missed his true calling as a motivational speaker. Time to meet this week's match-to-be. Reynaldo? Hi. Angie Dove. Nice to meet you. This is what I'm looking for. That was my first official match. Robin, my college roommate, and Jeremy, who I met in Behavioral Psychology. Still together after all these years. So, she's not available? We tape over five days. First, I sit down with you to get a sense of who you are and what you're looking for in a relationship. Then, in a series of speed dates, you meet our candidates and they meet you. You and Angie consult again, Angie picks the top prospect and sets up an ideal date for the two of you. This isn't a dating show. My mission is to find your one and only soulmate. Well, I'm a chef at a new restaurant in town, Taverna Cielo, so I work most nights, and I'm just looking for someone who'll share my love for folk-dancing and the accordion. Cut! Violet, let's get a touch up on Reynaldo. He's looking a little moist. "Folk-dancing and the accordion?" This will test my theory that for every single sock, there's another sock out there just waiting to be found. I fear we've got ourselves one permanently lost sock. And Kristen's with us now. That was a funny moment but this is a serious matter. Police have issued a warrant for "person of interest" Aaron Scheller in the stabbing death of Emma Patterson. What? Dad, you are not gonna believe what that rookie detective on Emma's case did. I'm sorry, dear, I didn't hear you. I was talking to this rookie detective about Emma's case. Wha-- what is he doing here? I was Detective Carter's training officer when he first joined the force. He used to call me on some of his cases. This is your daughter? Yeah. She doesn't look like you. Thankfully. Can you imagine if she did? I was adopted, as if it's any of your business. But I was told her name was Angie Dove. That's her TV name. What's wrong with Colomba? That's what I tell her. Both of you, stop. If you have something to say, say it to me! I'm sorry. Go ahead with what you were telling your dad. Something about a rookie detective? How can you issue a warrant for Aaron? He wasn't even there! Emma said he was working. Well, yes, he was working, but he wasn't in the office. He was actually upstairs in his study, and he seems to have left in quite a hurry because the caterers said that they saw his car in the garage before Emma's death, but not after. In addition, they have it on very good authority that Emma looked troubled when she went upstairs. That's the exact word that was used, "troubled." And why haven't heard from Mr. Scheller since his fiancé's death? That doesn't make him a murderer. No, but it does make him a "person of interest," which gives us probable cause for a warrant. Now, if you'll excuse me, this rookie detective, who's actually been solving cases for fifteen years, has gotta get back to work. You are not going to drop this are you? Even if this old detective begs you? How can I, Dad? I know something that he doesn't. Emma was Aaron's perfect match, and you don't kill your perfect match. Now, where would you start? That's easy. Where everything starts. The scene of the crime. Angie Dove! So good to see you again, Officer Lowry. How is everything? To be honest, not so great, For our twentieth, I got my wife this extremely nice vacuum cleaner, which turns out wasn't the ideal gift. Listen, I was hoping to get into the house for a moment. Oh, I'm afraid that can't happen. See, I left my purse, with my phone, somewhere inside, and I simply cannot function without them. Sorry, Ms. Dove, the place is off-limits, it's an active crime scene. I understand. For your twentieth, consider emeralds. Oh, there's a jeweler in Center City. He makes the most beautiful and surprisingly affordable earrings. I, uh-- Wait, what's his name? Let me check. My phone is inside the house. Oh, well. Bye, officer. Uh, Ms. Dove. Looking for this? Ah, there it is! Thank you! You know, you really are good at this detective stuff. Uh-huh. You know, it's funny finding your purse here, after an entire forensic team failed to come across it. Yeah, funny. Okay, fine, the purse was just an excuse to get in and look around. I thought I could offer a different perspective. You know, if I was so inclined, I could charge you with interfering in a police investigation. C'mon, I'm the daughter of Nick Colomba. I know enough not to touch anything. I see. Care to share with me? Well, since you ask, you might consider combing your hair back and using a little product for a more contemporary look. I meant about the case. Right. Find anything interesting? Well, it's what I didn't find that's interesting. Let me show you. Okay, so, an envelope from the Law Office of Rose Clarke. It's sliced open, but-- No letter. And no letter opener, clearly missing from this matching desk set, which means that it could be the weapon used on Emma. Anything else? Yes, this tissue in the waste basket. It appears to be smudged with make-up. It certainly does. You have a good eye, Ms. Colomba. Thank you. But we already knew all that. The letter opener isn't missing. The refrigerator in the garage was rattling slightly, so we looked behind it and we found the letter opener. It appears somebody tried to wipe it clean, So, we're gonna have it checked for prints and analyze the blood, but it's worth noting that the letter opener was only a few feet away from where Mr. Scheller parks his car. That doesn't prove anything. In isolation, no, but the elements together paint a pretty damning picture. A troubled woman goes upstairs, her fiancé there, having just met with his attorney. She wipes away her tears she takes off her ring. Then soon after, she is stabbed with a letter opener in what appears to be a crime of passion. Then the killer leaves by the same route and at the same time as Mr. Scheller. How about we make a deal, Ms. Colomba? I'll leave the matchmaking to you, and you leave the murder investigation to me, huh? Thank you for your kind offer, but you should know you have two problems with your damning picture. First, if Emma had wiped away tears, then the tissue would also show signs of mascara, which it doesn't. Second, Emma couldn't have taken off her ring upstairs. Because at some point she took it off downstairs. Did you watch the video? See you later, Detective. Thank you, Officer. You'll find the earrings at Sol's on Jewelers' Row, and, for an extra 20 % off, tell him Angie Dove sent you. Much obliged. Easy there, Chuck Norris. We're here for the exercise, not to take down the mob. Sorry, I'm just so frustrated. I want to help, you know, but so far the evidence against Aaron looks terrible, and where is he, anyway? Plus, I keep thinking about what Benjamin said. "Stay as far away from this as possible." Forget Benjamin. What would Emma want? Justice. Sorry. Angie D. Welcome. Are you here to get a new 'do in honor of Emma? Well, actually, I was ho-- Don't worry, I'll be gentle. Come. Okay. Isn't that The MatchMaker? Yeah, that's Angie Dove. Angie, I never miss your show. Oh, thank you. Piper hasn't been in since it happened. There was tension between those two. Piper was afraid that the marriage meant the end of the salon. Emma's ex, Bo, that bouncer over at Infinity Lounge, claimed he was still in love with her. I heard Bo got in a fight with Aaron the day before the party. That ring was over $25,000. Of course, and a new wife means less inheritance for Declan. Aaron's son treated Emma like she was some sort of gold-digger. As if she was only into him because of his dad's money-- Emma's ex, Bo, that bouncer over at Infinity Lounge... That ring was over $25,000... Of course, and a new wife means less inheritance for Declan... Stylings By Emma. For the third time, I don't know. Piper hasn't been in. Yes, I will tell her that Larry G has her cash. Got it. Almost done? I should probably get back to the studio. Just finishing now. Wow. That is really something. Piper? Just text me the address. Oh, gotta go. Bye. Hi. It's Angie Dove. I'm so sorry about Emma. I still can't believe it happened. Are you coming to the salon? It looks like you could use something. Uh, it's for a thing. Listen, I wanted to ask you about Emma at the party. Did she seem troubled to you? Troubled? No, not at all. Did she say anything about her ring? Was she wearing it when you two spoke? She said something about needing to have it resized. Well, I should get to work. Good to see you, Angie. Oh, one more thing. I understand Larry G has been trying to reach you. Something about having your cash? Paige, just got back from Emma's salon and I learned so much! What happened to your hair? Violet, help! That place was like a tsunami of information. For one thing, I ran into Emma's cousin, Piper, who became quite nervous when I brought up the engagement ring, which she claims Emma said was being resized. Resized? But it was a perfect fit. Exactly. Also, it seems that Emma's former boyfriend, some bouncer named Bo, confronted Aaron the day before the party, saying he still loved her. Hang on, so that gives "Bo the Bouncer" a motive for murder, too. Maybe, but it's all second-hand. I want to hear it straight from the bouncer's mouth. Wait! Leave the hair! Angie, no. Bad idea! I'm going undercover. That's an even worse idea! ♪ This is embarrassing. So, why did you insist on coming? I was worried about you. I can handle Bo. Hi. Hi. Hello. Here to pick up your kids? I beg your pardon? We're here to talk about our friend, Emma. No comment. Well, you were pretty vocal the day before Emma died, when you harassed her fiancé. Like I said, I've got nothing to say. Yeah, no, you're right. Don't talk to us. Save it for the police. Well, you're obviously a prime suspect. How do you figure that? You're the cliché jealous ex. I was no ex, and it was her so-called fiancé that was jealous after I told him that I was still seeing Emma. Emma would never cheat on Aaron, and definitely not with you. Yeah, why are you lying? Angry that she loved him and not you? And I'm done. Alright, move along, ladies. Hey, we have just as much right to be here as anyone else. Yeah, leave them alone! What are you gonna do about it? Relax. Remind me to never go clubbing with you again! Don't worry. It's fine. Exactly like before. Hair crisis averted. Now, about tomorrow, you still haven't picked Reynaldo's speed dates. I can't stop thinking about Bo. I don't see him as a viable match. Look, Bo claims he was still seeing Emma, right? But if he did still love her, then where's the grief? And if he wasn't in love, why confront Aaron? Good points, all. Now, back to the speed dates. Another thing, you know that smudged make-up on the tissue in Aaron's study? If it wasn't Emma's, then whose? Angie. I think someone's in the house. What did you say? Angie. Hello? Angie. Angie. Angie, Angie, Angie. Aaron, what are you doing in my kitchen? Well, I was afraid I'd be seen, so I went around the side of the house and found the door was unlocked, so. No, I didn't mean why are you in kitchen, I meant, why are you here, and where have you been? I needed you to know that I loved Emma with all my heart. I would never hurt her. I believe you, but then why run? I didn't run. I left be-- Before it happened. But it was your engagement party. She called it off. The party? The engagement. My gosh, what happened to your eye? Oh, Emma's former boyfriend sucker-punched me the day before the party. And Emma gave you some concealer to cover it up? That explains the tissue with makeup. Why did Emma call off the engagement? She didn't say. She just said it was for the best. The police? I was on the phone when I heard the noise. My friend must've called. Aaron, please, running only makes you look guilty. What would you have me do? Stay and go to prison for a murder I didn't commit? No, stay and fight to prove your innocence. We don't have a lot of time and I need some answers. Where did you go when you left the party? I drove. I needed to clear my mind. I have a friend who has a cottage up near Hawk Mountain. I knew he wasn't using it, so I went there. Listen, I didn't know Emma was killed until I heard about it on the radio this morning. Did Bo tell you he was still seeing Emma? Yeah, I knew he was lying. How? 'Cause I know Emma. Tell me about Rose Clarke. Why did you meet with her before the party? And what's the significance of the number "117,500?" Police. Open the door! Ms. Dove, I'm Rose Clarke. Thank you for convincing Aaron to surrender. He's much safer here than out there with a warrant hanging over his head. Ms. Clarke, the meeting you had with Aaron the day of the party. Was that to discuss a prenuptial agreement? That information is privileged. Without a waiver from my client, I'm not at liberty to answer. Were you and Aaron ever more than "attorney-client"? I won't answer that, either. Privileged information? Just none of your business. That's fair, but you might want to check your make-up. It looks like you've been crying over the arrest of a certain client. Thank you again, Ms. Dove. We've booked Mr. Scheller for murder. You're making a mistake. Well, that's for the D.A. to decide. I'm interested in all evidence, whether it points to guilt or innocence, and since you're clearly not gonna stay away from the case, you want to tell me what you know? Yes. Bo sucker-punched Aaron the day before the party, explaining the smudged tissue. It could be extortion or blackmail and that's why Emma got rid of her ring. Plus Piper received several calls from someone named "Larry G" saying "I've got your cash." All of this is very helpful but it's not gonna clear Mr. Scheller. What about this? Whatever this text Emma is getting here might have convinced her to call off the engagement. Well, we've subpoenaed all of Emma's phone records, but all that's gonna tell us is the number the text came from. So, to see the actual messages we need to unlock her phone, and to unlock the phone we have to guess her security code? Should we give it a try? After three failed attempts we're locked out for 24 hours. After six, we're locked out permanently. Let's try ten-twenty-four, her birthday. No go. Five-nine-two-five, the street address of her salon? Strike two. Zero-three-two-eight. What's that? The date Emma met Aaron on my show. It was a long shot, good news is we get three more guesses, try again in 24 hours. I'll do more research before then. Angie, any comment on what's being called The Matchmaker Murder? Watch out. Coming through. Excuse me. Aaron Scheller turned himself in to none other than Angie Dove aka "The MatchMaker," who had set up the suspect and victim on her popular TV show. We caught Dove leaving the Philadelphia police department last night in a media circus. Angie, any comment on what's being called The MatchMaker Murder? Why did I say? Stay away. What did you do? Arrange for the surrender of the prime suspect. Does anyone listen to me? You get upset so often, it's hard to tell-- That was a rhetorical question. Now there's no chance that the network will renew us. I'm going update my resume, and I suggest you do the same. Angie, I'm so sorry I called the police. No, you were just trying to protect me. I'm sorry I put the show at risk. No, you had to. It was the right thing to do. This blew up so fast. Do you have any idea how many mentions you've gotten on social media? You know I don't care about that. How many? Wow. Yeah. Wow. Look, we've got a show to do. At least for the time being. So, let's go make a match. Okay. My father was a rancher, but I wasn't able to follow in his footsteps due to my asthma. I collect tapes of great soccer matches, like, uh, like USA vs. Argentina 1999. Have you seen that one? No? Keller won the ball from Ibarra who then passed to Fraser. He found Moore and Moore just took it all the way down to the end. He had three guys on him and he took one and he took the other and he was like right in front of the goal and then he shot it and it just went in and we all just screamed "Goal!" Yeah. It was fun. Uh, let's go with one more button. He's not too good at small talk. Or medium or large talk, either. We still haven't seen that spark. “Spark” may be asking too much. “Tepid ember” may be more realistic. Let's not give up on our single sock just yet. Ange, have you picked Reynaldo's match yet? Well... A murder board? That's kind of crazy and awesome. So, who are the top suspects? Okay, so far, Bo the bouncer, Piper, the cousin who's hiding something, and Declan, the resentful would-be stepson. What about Aaron, the recently dumped fiancé? It seems like we're missing something. I mean, Aaron was one of Philly's most eligible men, right? So maybe one of his exes acted out of jealousy, or... like a certain attorney I recently ran into. And don't forget about Aaron's ex of exes, his first wife. Maybe she wasn't too happy about a new Mrs. Scheller either. May I speak to Dr. Warren, please? Do you have an appointment? She's only seeing patients today. You're lucky we had a cancelation. Where's your pain? Actually, I'm here to talk about your ex-husband. I meant your pain, not mine. I mean, you don't want Aaron convicted of a murder he didn't commit, do you? And you're so sure he's innocent. Maybe he's not the man you think he is. Do you know he cheated on me when we were married? I can't believe that. Neither could I. Open, please. We don't ha-- Okay. I just couldn't ignore the evidence. Sudden hang-ups, suggestive notes in coat pockets. Lipstick print on a handkerchief? It's all in a box in the attic. When we split, he discovered he was a very rich and eligible bachelor. Then how did you feel about Emma? Pity. What about your son Declan? How did he feel about his father remarrying? You are being very bold asking under the circumstances. Open. Ah! Ah! Yes, Declan-- Agh! --Has had his issues. He's stuck with a self-involved father. But he's doing his best to put his life back together. Anything else you can tell me? You have a cavity in your lower right second molar. Won't take more than a few minutes to fill. Thanks for seeing me. I'm trying to help Aaron in any way I can. Oh, well we appreciate it. What's happening to him is absurd. Please sit. Thanks. Unfortunately, there's a lot of circumstantial evidence against him. I'm looking to see if anyone else might've had a motive. Such as? Jealousy, for one. Are either of you familiar with any women Aaron might have dated after his divorce? There were a few. Let's see... The architect from the Benton project, a cellist with the philharmonic, and an actual Greek heiress. And let's not forget about me. But it was nothing serious. We can write out a list if you like? Thank you. Uh, what about when he was married? He ex-wife accused him of cheating. Aaron? No, he's too much of a straight shooter. Absolutely not the type. Huh. May I ask what's happening with Ms. Clarke's accounting? Oh, that. Um-- False alarm. After Emma's death there's no need for a prenup, so no need to review the books. That's lucky. For you. Is there anything else you can tell me? Thank you for your time. One more thing. Does the number 117,500 mean anything to you? Mmm... No. No. Okay. Paige, I know, I'm sorry. I told you I'd have Reynaldo's match by now but I just can't stop thinking about this case. Yeah, I know. I'm having the same problem. Wha-- who is this? Detective Carter. Detective Carter? Uh, why are you calling me? Because we had a date, remember? We're trying to access Emma's phone? Of course. You know, I thought you meant-- Instead, of course you meant-- Lemme get my notes. Okay, so let's-- let's try 4177. Emma's street number growing up. Nope. Sorry. Um... how 'bout 6831? The last four digits of her social security number? No, that didn't work either. We have one last guess left. Darn, darn, darn. Do we go with 1979, the year she was born, or-- 41-33? Final score of-- Super Bowl 52, Eagles beat the Patriots. Now we're talkin'! Or maybe... we should take more time. Not rush into anything. Yeah. Agreed. Lemme know if you think of anything else and uh, we can talk later. Take care. Allen Wrench. And now that the show's connection to Emma and Aaron is out, we'll probably be cancelled. Oh, that's rough, honey. Phillips? What's worse is I'm beginning to question my judgment. You know, if I could be so wrong about Aaron, I could be wrong about everything. Piper, Bo, even Emma? What does your gut tell you? Aaron is innocent! Then keep doin' what you're doin'! I'd trust that gut of yours over anyone's. Thanks, Dad. Assembly. I can't help you Aaron, unless you tell me the truth. I've never lied to you. Yeah, but you also haven't told me everything you know. Why you met with Rose Clarke on the day of the party? And-- and what was in the envelope she gave you? Why don't you just ask her? I did. She couldn't answer because of attorney-client privilege. Just trust me. None of that has anything to do with Emma's death. Why are you holding back? Are you trying to protect someone? You know, your ex-wife doesn't think too highly of you. I don't blame her. She said you cheated on her. That part is not true. It doesn't matter. Listen, I was-- I was always focusing on myself. I was never much of a husband for her or a father to Declan but that I'm trying to make up for. And-- and-- I just hope it's not too late. It's never too late to do the right thing. I need you to go talk to my son and get him to come visit me here. Please. Of course. Can I give this to him? Emma's vows. "A match made in heaven. "Where one becomes two. "And two becomes one." I'm gonna give you permission to speak with Rose Clarke. That may getcha outta here. Miss Dove. I've spoken to my client. What would you like to know? Why did you and Aaron meet on the day of the murder? Was it to-- A little up on the left. Was it to prepare a prenuptial agreement? No. I advised he get one but he wouldn't hear of it. 'Cause marriage is for life, he said. Then why? Aaron thought that someone was embezzling from his company. He hired my firm to conduct an audit. Smidge more on the right. Wouldn't Phillip Price handle that as Chief Financial Officer? No, Aaron wanted to keep it off the records because of who he suspected. Phillip? Declan. He even had my auditors come at night so that no one would know. So the amount 117,500, is that what Declan stole? No. Declan took 17,500 sloppily and easy to detect. The other 100,000 was skimmed using false invoice and off-shore bank accounts. A very sophisticated scheme. How's this? Do-- do you mind if I-- Just-- okay. Perfect. But what could all of this have to do with Emma's death? That I don't know. Thank you for your help, Miss Dove. If there's nothing else? Were you in love with Aaron? I was. I still am, actually. We dated for a while and it didn't last. I don't know why. How did you feel about Emma? Resentful. Jealous, wondering what he saw in her that he didn't see in me. It's hard, Miss, Dove, when the man you're meant to be with doesn't feel the same. Angie Dove for Declan Scheller again? Uh, just have him call me when he gets in. I learned so much about the case today! I can't wait to hear about it later. Taverna Cielo or whatever it's called moved Reynaldo's shift and he's gotta leave in 20 minutes. Okay. Uh-- no problem. I hope that means you made a decision on his date? Well-- You've gotta pick someone, unless this is gonna be our first "man dates self" episode and I don't think our audience is ready for that. Oh. Violet's dog-walker cancelled and I told her she could bring Ziggy to work. Aw. Now, who's it gonna be? Caroline? Nina. No. Sarah? Jocelyn. Monica... Brandy. So, after meeting your potential matches, how do you feel? They were all wonderful, but did I feel what you call a spark? No. Miss Dove, I know I'm not a big success or the best talker. What I have to offer is my heart. I'm hoping that's enough. I have your ideal match. It's our makeup artist, Violet. During very speed date, you were-- anxious. But on breaks I saw you relax and just be yourself with Violet, and I saw the same from her. So what do you both say? Mm-hm. Fantastic! Okay, now, for your perfect date tomorrow night, it is... a surprise! But trust me, it'll be amazing. Cut! You have no idea about their date, do you? Not a one. Well, where are you going now? I promised I'd do a favor for a friend. Declan's still not in. Okay. I will wait. Hi, Mom. Yes, I RSVP'd to Joan's wedding. Because I'm not bringing anybody. 'Cause I'm not dating anybody. Stephanie and I broke up. I know, Mom. I liked her, too, it's-- Mom, I gotta go. I love you. I'll call you later. Piper? Angie Dove? What are you doing here? I'm, uh-- I'm just waiting to talk to Declan. Well, it might be a long wait. He's not the most reliable of employees. Well, uh-- Since I'm already here, I wondered if I could ask the two of you some follow-up questions. I've been reviewing video of the party and I can't seem to place either of you at the time of Emma's death. What do you mean? We were there. You spoke to us. Earlier, yes. But there's no sign of you when Emma died or afterwards, during the police interviews. There's one other thing. Your bottle of scotch never made it to the gift table. Are you suggesting we had something to do with Emma's death? No! No, no, I'm not suggesting anything. I'm, uh-- investigating. Well, Miss Dove, as it turns out, you're right. We opted to leave early and enjoy the scotch ourselves. At Phillip's. I had no idea. Good, because it's none of your business. Now, if you'll excuse us. When Declan arrives, please give him this, and tell him it's urgent. Thanks. Yep. Declan! Angie. What's going on here, Piper? I-- Come here, come here. It's not what you think. How was I supposed to know a major police investigation was underway? May the love of God bless and console us, and gently wipe away every tear from our eyes. Amen. Amen. See you at the studio. It was considerate of you to give Aaron a chance to mourn. Well, innocent till proven guilty, right? Right. Still, I-- I don't think a lot of detectives would've done it. We both know one. And he just so happens to be the guy that trained me. What about Piper? Was that money from her pawning Emma's ring? Yes, according to Piper, Emma said that Declan needed cash desperately, so she arranged for Piper to pawn the ring and then give Declan the proceeds. Her own engagement ring? After Emma's death, Piper wasn't sure what to do. Then she decided to honor her cousin's request and sell the ring to help Declan. Wow. Yep. That about sums it up. Let me know when you wanna take the last guess at Emma's security code. Okay. Okay. Angie. Declan. It's all my fault. I lost control. And things-- they kept getting worse and worse. I never meant for any of this to happen. What did Declan have to say? A lot. He started gambling again, racking up losses. He was skimming from his dad's firm to pay them off. Declan stole $17,500. Aaron kept it quiet. Maybe he was afraid it would implicate Declan in Emma's death. Did you know that he tried to steal Emma's ring and she caught him in the act? I bet Declan assumed Emma told his dad and they got in a fight. Correct. And he didn't want to say anything after Emma's death for fear of showing that his dad had a motive. So heartbreaking. Aaron covering for his son, Declan covering for his dad. Save your sympathy. The kid had a motive for murder. Oh, you don't think Declan? Well, I would have considered him, except he's got a credit card receipt from an off-track betting parlor just a few miles away at the time of the killing. Well, that's one bet that paid off. So what's gonna happen to him? Well, nothing. That's one of the beautiful things about stealing from your father. By the way, if embezzling is a valid motive for murder, you should know that Rose Clarke found out someone else also was stealing from Scheller Development, to the tune of 100,000 grand. Remember that number, 117,500? It covers two separate crimes. Also you should know that Rose used to date Aaron, as did Rachel Turner. Rose admitted to still being in love with him, which I wouldn't be surprised applied to a few other women, but not his ex-wife, who hates his guts. Anything else? Just that I see you took my advice about using product in your hair. I like it. I mean, it looks better. Thank you. It's from my dad. Yeah, mine too. "Hey Detectives, "I have some info you might find interesting." Your car or mine? Fast Lou. Hey! Want you to meet my daughter. Oh! Enchanté! And Detective Carter. Ah. Well, please. When I heard about Emma's ex, I put the word out to my contacts, asking for intel. Fast Lou here got in touch. Go ahead, Lou. You see, in my former life I was what you might consider a facilitator in the uh, second-hand automobile market. A car thief. Comme ci, comme ca. Anyway, I still have friends-- acquaintances-- in the trade, one of whom had told me that this Bo had contacted him. He wanted to get a '69 classic Chevy Corvette. Now, my acquaintance was dubious that Bo could afford such a get, but Bo told him he had a benefactor who had recently paid him an enormous um of money to, quote, "ruin a relationship", close quote. Thanks, Lou. Oh, no. That is not necessary. No, no, it is reward enough just to meet the great Angie Dove. Thank you. Thank you. I will, however, take a ride downtown if you would be so kind. Ah. From captain to cabby. How the mighty have fallen. By the way, how's the old Alfa Romeo doin'? Wow. So, what now? Well, now we bring Bo in for questioning. Mind I ride along? Seeing as how you are my ride. Uh, how could I turn down the great Angie Dove, huh? Come on. He's quite the character, huh? No kidding. So, this is a stakeout. Hm. You know, you and I are kinda in the same line of work. I don't think so. Well, we both make observations, make connections. You know, evaluate character? Yeah, but police work is serious business. And matchmaking isn't? What could be more important than finding the person you're meant to be with? Well, for starters, I don't buy into the whole "there's only one, one and only" theory of relationships. In reality, there are plenty of women that I could be happy with that would be perfectly happy with me. Uh-huh. Meeting someone is more of a matter of chance than anything else. Before I answer, what's the penalty for assaulting a police officer? Okay, if what I do is so easy, then tell me, uh, that couple right there. Good match or not? Okay, fine. I'll play. Yay! The gentleman's posture and bearing indicates somebody that is forthright. Her frequent glances at him indicate a deep attraction. I would say that they are definitely in love. Oh, yeah? Mm-hm. Did you also notice how he never looks at her, even when she's talking, and how they're walking side by side but they never quite touch? Yeah. Meet Mr. Dating for Four Years and Taking it for Granted for Three. Well, I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on that one. Since there's no way to tell who's actually right and who's-- Wrong? Hmm. Wanna play again? Best two out of three? No, I'm probably just gonna focus. Yeah. Catch some bad guys. Yeah. Sleepy? No, um-- No, no, no. I'm good. I'm good. We got a visual on the suspect. Ah, it's go time. Ah, and by that, I mean it's go time for me. It's stay time for you. Oh, come on! Don't leave this car. ♪ ♪ Hey, Bo. Hyah! What? I never left the car, just like you said. And there you go. Ah. This is so awesome. Well, don't get used to it. I'm letting you observe this once because you're-- I took down the perp. Yes, I did. In your face, perp! Okay, let's not do that. Taunting is very frowned upon in our business. Right. I ain't say nothin'. Oh, that's a double negative. You might wanna watch that. It makes for a messy transcript at the sentencing. I'm not gonna play games with you, Bo. I know you killed Emma. Killed? I didn't kill nobody. "Anybody", and we have evidence to prove the contrary. You were dating Emma and she was marrying someone else. So what was it? Jealousy? Revenge? No, you got it all wrong. Alright? I was lying about that. Oh! I knew it! I knew you were lying! Someone hired me to make it look that way to break up their engagement. But it didn't work because her fiancé didn't believe me. He trusted her. If what you're tellin' me is true, what's the name of the person that hired you? See, that's the thing. All right? It was all done in secret. All the texts, the wired money. Look, no name was attached. I don't know who set it up. Bo knows more than he's saying. What makes you think that? The way he hunched over, and shuffled his feet and then the way he kept working his hands and covered his mouth. Well, that is very impressive, Miss Colombo. Unfortunately, we're not gonna be able to hold him for very much longer. There's no law against pretending to be in a relationship. Otherwise our prisons would be even more crowded. What if we could search his phone? Without a warrant? Not happening. Okay, but, let's say that somebody found a phone. Just lying on the ground, and uh, I mean, wouldn't that person be able to search the phone to figure out who it belonged to? You know, you remind me more and more of your father. Yes, someone could search the phone if someone could guess what the security code was which someone has not been able-- Done. How? 1-2-3-4. I figured Bo wasn't too imaginative. Heh. Okay. Well, here's a text to Bo's benefactor, saying that he'll expose him unless he gets "a fat cash bonus". Without Bo actually knowing who his benefactor is? What a liar! Seems to have worked out. The payoff is scheduled tomorrow at noon in front of 582 Marshall Street. I that area. That's where I used to take the Norristown bus to Villanova. Okay. If-- if we release Bo and then we keep an eye on him, couldn't we catch him in the act? You know what? That is a fine idea. Yeah? Except for the "we" part. Things could get dangerous tomorrow. You have to promise me that you'll stay away. Aren't you Angie Dove, the MatchMaker from TV? No. No, no, no, no. You look just like her, it's uncanny! You could be twins. I get that a lot, but-- Yeah. Okay, fine. It's me, but I'm undercover right now. I'm trying to help catch a criminal. I'd really appreciate it if you'd pretend that I'm not me. By the way, you might wanna consider switching to a cooler color palette to better highlight those gorgeous eyes of yours. Thank you! Stay down. Stay down. Don't move. Ah. Ha! Oh. It's really me. Wow. You know, you promised you'd stay away. I know. How 'bout I make it up to you with the license plate number of that van? This is huge. I mean, this is big. This shows that somebody was willing to kill in order to keep the truth from coming out. Hey. I mean-- So, your daughter's down here... Ah. For me? Yeah. Say hello. Hello? Hi, Dad. No, I-- He's right. I know it's dangerous, but I-- Okay. Okay. I'll be more careful in the future. I can't believe you told on me! Snitch. There it is, the solution! You think you solved the case? No, no, the solution to Reynaldo and Violet's date! Oh, it's perfect! Welcome to Taverna Cielo, a touch of old Argentina. This might be our last episode. So let's make it our best. Here we serve both the sizzle and the steak. Who knew our sock could be so charming? He's in his element. Phillip Price? What's this? Oh, that's a search warrant. You're gonna love this. It's a match! We did it again. I love this show! Me too. Let's hope we can keep doing it. Did you know "cielo" in Spanish means heaven? That makes this a literal "match made in heaven". "A match made in heaven". Paige, you're a genius! I think I know the code to Emma's phone. It's from Emma's vows. "One becomes two and two become one." 1-2-2-1. Okay. We're in. Ha! I am checking the last text that Emma received at the party. "Stop the marriage or Declan goes to jail." So Emma called off the engagement to protect Declan. Mm-hm. Who else knew about Declan's theft at the time? Besides Aaron? Rose Clarke, because of her audit. Which would suggest at least one other person knew. The CFO. Yep. The text to Emma came from the same number used to contact Bo. It's from a burner phone that we recovered from Phillip Price's desk when we searched it. Phillip? Mm-hm, alongside a keys to a white van that was owned by Scheller Development. Thanks to you, we arrested Price an hour ago. But why would Phillip-- To cover his own embezzlement. The 100,000. Well, the 100,000 was this year but he's been running the same scam for a while. He's stolen over $500,000. Yeah, but still, why kill Emma? Well, he probably panicked at the idea of a possible prenup, decided to kill Emma to stop the audit. Okay, but what about Rachel? She said that she was with Phillip when Emma was murdered. They're a couple, right? She lied to cover for him. It was all about money? No crime of passion? Given the attempt on Bo's life, and the arrest of Price, we no longer have probable cause to hold Aaron, so the good news is your friend is gonna be out within the hour. A crime of passion. Mm. Sorry. Dr. Maureen Warren here. Hi, Doctor. Angie Dove? Remember when you said you had a box of evidence that Aaron was cheating? I need to see it. I'd be happy to show it to you. Monday. Oh, no, no-- uh no. It can't wait till Monday. I need to see it right away. Miss Dove, I'm in the middle of a date right now, and I'd rather not be disturbed, if you catch my drift. Uh, I-- I do. And I'm sorry. But this is extremely important. It could be-- life or death. The box is in the attic. And-- I'd have to crawl around up there and it's very dusty. I empathize completely which is why that I absolutely 100 % must insist. Also, um, make sure he listens to you and pay attention to how he describes his mother. Hey. Thought you could use a ride home. Yeah. Thank you. You have no idea how important-- It's a match. First you have nothing to say, now you wanna talk. Okay. So talk. The person you are trying to reach is not accepting calls at this ti-- I admit I might've-- misappropriated some funds but the rest-- I'm telling you, I was set up. This is Detective Carter. Leave a message, I'll get back to you. Thanks. I know who the real killer is. And it's not Phillip. If I'm right, Aaron is in danger. Please call me. Welcome home, Dad. Thank you, Son. I'll uh, lock up and get the lights? Please. If I'm right, Aaron is in danger. Please call me. ♪ Angie. What are you doing here? I was worried. I tried to reach you. Well, I turned off my phone. I was getting too many calls from reporters. Uh, are you okay? I'm fine. I'm just tired. Please, go. I'll give you a call in the morning. Okay. Well, good night, Aaron. Angie. I had to warn you. I know who killed Emma. It was-- Rachel. What gave me away, Miss Dove? Well, I-- I had a hunch when you claimed that you and Phillip were a couple. Clearly there was no "there there". No, such a weak and inconsequential man. I only gave him an alibi to give myself one. And-- and then, the more I thought about Emma's death, the more I realized it only made sense as a crime of passion. Calling off the engagement gave everyone what they wanted. No audit for Phillip, No second family for Declan. Bo paid by his benefactor. Only you couldn't get what she wanted. Aaron's love. What? I had no idea. I knew the moment you and I met that we were meant to be. Aaron was married at the time but that was no obstacle. You just simply planted the evidence of an affair so Maureen would leave him. I did you a favor! Only someone unworthy would think you capable of infidelity. And then when we finally did start going out, we were perfect together. We had an understanding! An understanding? That involved you going on some reality TV show to meet your match? Do you know that I was there the night of the auction? People applauded when he was declared the high bidder. With me, his date, standing right by his side. And then to be thrown over by that hair stylist? I mean I assumed in time you'd come to your senses, which is why I was so stunned to hear about the proposal. I thought paying Bo to break it up would work, but-- But it didn't. Because Aaron trusted Emma. So you threatened to take down Declan instead, unless Emma called off the engagement. That fool Phillip told me what your son had done. But you got what you wanted. Emma did call it off. So, why kill her? I was there to watch. Across the hall when she called off the engagement. But then I saw how you looked at her. And in that instant, I knew you could never feel the same for me. So you killed Emma out of spite. Actually, in that moment I would have preferred to kill you. But you left. And she just happened to see me. But now I'm grateful. Grateful for the second chance at a true crime of passion. Angie! Where are you? Agh! Get up. Are you okay? Yeah. You're gonna be okay, Declan. Ah. Nice collar, Ms. Colomba. Thank you, Detective. Of course, I couldn't have done it without your timely backup. Yeah, well you're welcome. I must say, you're lucky there's so little traffic 'cause one more red light-- I'd rather not think about it. What? Well, I'm just thinking about the reaction your dad's gonna have when I tell him what happened. What? You're gonna snitch on me again? Oh, 100 %. What kind of friend is that? A friend that cares? And wants to see him laugh his butt off. Whatever. I'm glad you're okay. Me too. Mmm! This all looks amazing. So, what was the key piece of evidence for you? Well, when I realized that Phillip was framed. Oh. You're talking to your daughter. Okay. I knew that Aaron wouldn't cheat on Maureen, which meant that somebody went to a lot of effort to make it look like he did, the same way somebody worked hard to end the engagement. I don't know, the events seemed linked. Then when I saw the lip-print on the handkerchief-- - I was sure. And how did you know that Aaron didn't cheat? A man can hide many things, Detective, but his true character will always shine through. It's Benjamin from the network. This is it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. The MatchMaker was just renewed for another season! Plus, Angie's blowing up on the internet right now! What! "MatchMaker solves murder"? Hey, you were exceedingly helpful. Alright. Cheers. Cheers. Let's dig in. Yes, yes. This is gluten-free, and um-- Pass those eggs...
