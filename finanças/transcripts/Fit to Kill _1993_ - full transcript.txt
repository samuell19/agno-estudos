Yes. Dang it! You two are hopeless. That's three games in a row you guys have lost. We'll see you at Lucas' checkpoint. We're scheduled for target practice. Too little, too late. Do you hear a chopper? Hey, this isn't part of the drill! Run for cover! Not bad watch this It was the wind. Gotta adjust for that. Wow! This baby's more powerful than I thought. All agents, return to checkpoint. All agents, return to checkpoint immediately. Yeah, right there, Emerson. Okay, Lucas. That's fine. Very impressive. Come on, move it. - Okay. Get in here. What is going on? You're supposed to be alert at all times. The games aren't over until I give the command. This is the protocol. This 1s not new just because you two nailed Bruce and Shane doesn't mean the exercise is complete. You're both in a relaxed attitude you behave that way in the field, and you're dead. If you don't treat this exercise seriously, you're wasting my time and yours. Do you read me? - Yes, sir. - Nicole? Yes, sir. So this is what you attacked us with? I'll let Dr. Emerson tell you about it. This scale-model helicopter is our latest lethal weapon. It could've easily eliminated all of you. It has a great deal of firepower. It can carry four rockets many times more powerful than the ones we used in today's war games. And better still, it has a camera installed in its nose cone right here. The picture is transmitted to a video monitor so the ground operator can see exactly where the copter is going. The controls are here. Emerson will brief you in their operation. After that, get cleaned up and meet me at ksxy studio dismissed good afternoon. This is ksxy radio, molokai, Hawaii, the hottest music under the sun this 1s Ava, your moonlight mistress, on ksxy radio, with my lovely assistant, Sandy. You guys don't know what you're missing. And now, more music and the beat goes on. Right. The exercises are over, and Lucas called a meeting. They'll be here soon. Well, looks like we're gonna need more coffee. Okay. > Say ooh, la, la j» dd I ast time we shared a dream j > not like any other that I knew j Hi, darling, I had a great day today. How do you like this? This is for Mr. Chang's party. You have exquisite taste. What else did you buy? This is for after the party. A gift? Ooh, beautiful. This will accent the outfit perfectly. It is my purpose in life to live elegantly, to the limit and for you to share in my worldly goods, to a certain degree of course. Room service. That won't be necessary. Hold it right there. Now, if you allow me a moment to get dressed, perhaps you'll join me for dinner, strictly business. Morning. - Morning. - Good morning. - Morning, sir. - Good morning, sir. At ease. Where's that party? Hello, yes, no, answers? Where's edy? Nice of you to drop by. Uh, I had a little car trouble. Try a chair, agent stark. My shoe. Organized? Let's get started then. A very wealthy and powerful Chinese businessman by the name of Harris Chang is giving a party at his house on Maui, in two days time. Mr. Chang has an extremely important announcement to make. The event will have global implications. Mikael Petrov, a diplomat from the commonwealth of independent states, and his assistant are arriving in Honolulu on an air force jet now. Tomorrow, they fly to Maui on a commuter flight. Ava will meet them there. Petrov will be the main focus of the reception. Mr. Chang, through the state department, has requested that we attend this party to help check the security measures and offer any assistance we can to help the evening run smoothly. Donna, you, Nicole, Bruce and Ava will fly by your plane to Maui tomorrow morning. The instructions are in here you go to Mr. Chang's estate. He'll fill you in personally on the details. Sounds simple enough. Shane, you and Sandy stay here and watch the fort at the radio station. We'll stay in touch on the ksxy security phone line. Okay, everybody? Well, we've all got places to go. Dismissed. No bodyguards, Mr. Kane? Aren't you afraid I might try and kill you again? The knife seems so obvious. Wouldn't it be more of a challenge to use a salad fork? It doesn't matter what I use. I could kill you with my bare hands. True, and such lovely hands, too. You should've known I'd be wearing a vest. Your caution is legendary. It's a mistake I won't make twice you are a legend yourself, a most dangerous assassin. Codenamed blu Steele, isn't it? My former associate, Mr. genghis po, hired you to kill me. Tell me, is he still masquerading as a red Chinese agent? When po stole the nuclear trigger control, known as the klystron relay, he smuggled it out of red China and delivered it to you. You were to then peddle it to certain factions in the middle east that never happened. We were so close. Oh, it's priceless. The gyrocopter pilot, raven, had the nuclear relay in his possession. It had been concealed in a fake green Jade Buddha. Thank you for the operation. I must leave you now. Raven had the device with him when he departed a small island in the south pacific. He was to deliver it to me on my yacht. However, we underestimated the resourcefulness of a certain federal agent, Donna Hamilton. My relay. The nuclear relay was irretrievably lost, a most unfortunate episode. I formulated a rather complex plan of revenge. I was counting on po to send you to eliminate me. It now enables me to solicit your help. You want my help? Why should I help you? My plan will disrupt the American secret service in Hawaii, humiliate what remains of Russian intelligence. And what's in it for me? Enormous financial gain is one of the side effects of the scheme. I will repay po for the lost device. You will repay po for failing to kill me. And what would you have me do, Mr. Kane? We will leave for Honolulu in two hours. From there, we will cruise to Maui on my yacht. That should give you ample time to read this. You guys okay back there? - Fine, let's go. - Mm-hmm. Clear. I'm gonna put her down on the grass strip. We're going in, to change. Oh, good, can I watch? Give it a rest, Bruce. I'l check in with base and [I'll go pick up the Russians. Ksxy Sandy, this is Bruce. I just wanted to check in. Comin' through loud and clear. The eagle has landed. We're off and running. Gotcha, eagle, good hunting. - Lookin' good. - Let's go. For an agent in training, you're very disarming. I'll show you how disarming I am. That was easy. Watch this Come on, give me a hand to fix this thing. Special agent Donna Hamilton. My colleagues, Nicole Justin and Bruce Christian. It's an honor to meet you, sir. The pleasure is mine. Please be seated. Thank you. I would like to say that I'm retiring next week from a life of hard work and service to my community. The event I have planned is of historical significance, another stitch in the weaving of international unity among the great powers of the world. If it is to be successful, I would need your help. We've been placed at your disposal, sir. What are your needs? Have you heard of the Alexa diamond? It is one of the most exquisite stones in all the world, one of the few treasures of the Russian diamond mines in Siberia. It was discovered at the turn of the century. And in 1914, baron smilovich presented it to czarina Alexandra, hence the name Alexa. Leningrad was the city chosen to house the Alexa diamond, after the fall of tsarist regime. 25 years later, world war il began. On September the 6th, 1941, Leningrad was attacked by a massive German force. The Russians stood their ground, despite huge military losses. The Germans were slaughtering the Russians at a rate of 10 to one. This went on for two years. Fighting was at close quarters, hand-to-hand, and during one intense attack, the Germans penetrated the heavily guarded museum area where the Alexa diamond was kept. A German general, by the name of Heinrich rohr, personally went to the museum, to take command of this priceless treasure. It was to be given to Hitler in celebration of victory on the eastern front. But victory was not to be. It was now February, 1943. The German army had surrendered at stalingrad. Hitler demanded that his troops gain victory or die. General rohr was among the many generals who knew Hitler was militarily inept. They began plotting ways to eliminate him. Things went badly for the Germans in Leningrad. In January 1944, in the freezing weather conditions, the Russian counterattack began. The Germans entered Leningrad not as Victors, but as prisoners. On July 20, 1944, Hitler was trying in vain to stem the tide of defeat a bomb was placed in his bunker, in an attempt to kill him. Hitler managed to survive the explosion and hundreds of officers were put on trial and put to death. General rohr fled to Germany. He escaped to south America, where we met, and he entrusted me with the diamond before he died. Finally, he had escaped the purge of Hitler. Shiwan? It's exquisite. Why are you coming forward now? I want to give this diamond to the Russian people in their hour of freedom I'm grateful for your presence. If there are any other questions, shiwan will answer them for you. Do you have a guest list? Thanks. Anyone interesting? Martin Kane 1s on this list Mr. Chang's business ventures have brought him into contact with all kinds of people. After all, Martin Kane is a major entrepreneur in this part of the world. Kane? That bastard tried to have us killed. I can't wait for a chance to meet him face to face. He won't be hard to find. The necklace that silk gave him has a tracking device attached. All he has to do is wear it we'll know precisely where he is. Blu, today, you will demonstrate your commitment to me. Joe will drive you to a location, here on Maui. Very well, Mr. Kane. Emerson? - Blu? Do you have the goods? I was born with 'em oh, yeah? I et's see. Open it. That's quite a piece of machinery you have there, flyboy. It's long. It's quick. It's hard it's dangerous. It's aggressive. It's deadly. You got my money? Almost everything you want is right here. Almost. Catch you later. Drive carefully. Yeah, gotcha! You must Ava permit me to introduce myself. I am mikael Petrov, special envoy from the congress of people's deputies. My assistant, Gregor. Welcome to the United States thank you. Now we go to the hotel. I ike hotels oh, you'll have plenty of time to freshen up and change, before tonight's reception. An American mustang convertible, five-liter, v-8 engine. What a beautiful automobile. I must to drive it, please? Is it possible? In America, anything is possible. Is good to know. Excuse me, Ava, permit me. Thank you very much. Have fun. How do you do? Welcome good evening, sir. Good evening. Shall we? Good evening, sir. Duke devontre and party. Thank you, sir. Have a nice time. Chang's over there. I'll be outside if you need me. Okay. So far, so good. - Thank you. - Thanks. Martin Kane. - Excuse me. - Quite all right. Martin Kane. Why, miss Hamilton, good evening. You're as lovely in person as I had imagined. I'm not letting you out of my sight. Excellent, shall we dance? You've got to be kidding. Donna, may I call you Donna? No Donna, you mustn't disappoint me. You'll be disappointed the day I see you hang. As a condemned man, you have to accede to my last request. > The night is falling softly now j» > there's twilight in the air j» > see the magic dancing in your eyes j dpd you look across a crowded room j > I'm locked into your stare j j» I can't help melting though I know the price j > That you really are falling j» What are you doing after the party? Please, mikael, you are a diplomat. I only date tough guys. J» oh, I loved the dream j d but I can't make believe j come in, Bruce. Bruce, here. Everybody's dancing but us. Life's a bitch. How's it going out there? All's quiet. Good, I'll check back in fifteen, out. I'm not gonna dance with you. It's not about dancing. Have you been keeping your eye on them? > That you really are falling j» > That you won't deceive me j > That destiny's calling » j» oh, I loved the dream j d but I can't make believe j Thank you for the dance. That dance had nothing to do with music. Ladies and gentlemen, please. I hate to take the microphone from the lovely Ms. stark, but it's time to reveal to you the reason for our gathering. You all know me, my contributions to the financial history of this beautiful state of Hawaii. Station one, all quiet up here, Bruce. But first, I must tell you that I'm retiring. To begin, I must tell you the story of the Alexa diamond. The Alexa diamond was given to czarina Alexandra. Excuse me, miss, can I help you? I'm just looking for the ladies' room. Uh, that would be right here. Why, thank you. During the revolution of 1917, the bolsheviks confiscated it and later put it on display at a museum. I'd hoped you'd follow me. What are you doing up here? I assure you my intentions are strictly honorable. Donna, you don't know me. You know nothing about me, save for the few times we've been at cross purposes. Cross purposes? Donna, it is my intention to legitimize all my business dealings. I cannot go straight without a little cooperation. I have reasons for the life I've led up till now. What could I do to gain your trust? Apprise us of all your smuggling operations, give us the names of your contacts, surrender, right now. I surrender. I'm tired of your games, Mr. Kane. Sweet dreams, Donna. Fxcellent work all right, I believe it's my turn. See you back on the yacht. Sweet dreams, Casanova. Tonight, I will be fulfilling a pledge I made to my beloved friend, Mr. Heinrich rohr, on his deathbed. I will present the Alexa diamond to the people's deputy, Mr. mikael Petrov, on behalf of the freedom of the Russian people. Bring up the Duke devontre's car, please. Uh, shiwan, would you please get the diamond? The diamond's been stolen! - Oh no. - Just out the door. - Call the police. - Let's do that first deputy Petrov, the diamond! It 1s stolen no, no, don't worry, we'll get it back. Take it away, Joe. Bruce, get in here right away. All the guests are clean. Only a few people have left. Who was it that left? The Duke devontre and his party. That is impossible. I know the Duke, and he was definitely not here tonight. I et me handle this Silk, be a sweetheart and get the diamond, would you? Where'd your people go with the diamond? My people? To whom would you be referring? One of your people assumed the identity of the Duke devontre and crashed the party. Really, Mr. Lucas, you've quite an imagination. Ms. Hamilton can account for my whereabouts all evening. I can't account for anything after I was knocked out Donna, please? For the last time, I came here, danced with miss Hamilton. We went upstairs for a chat. The next thing I knew, shiwan was waking me. As from his Hamilton, I can only presume she was knocked out as well now, I'm tired. I'd like to leave I've had a very long evening. You're a suspect, Mr. Kane. I advise you to stay right here on Maui. You take that boat of yours out into open waters, I'll board you so fast, it'll make your head spin. If I decide to leave, I'll make sure to invite you both along for a cruise. That's all from here, Bruce, over and out. Well, our Russian friend is a little disappointed, considering he came all this way for nothing. You should take the Russians back to molokai, outta the way. The rest of us will stay here on Maui and try and dig something up. Okay. Gentlemen, follow me. There! Give it to me. With one stroke, I humiliate the Americans, the Russians and that bastard, Chang, a great victory. Congratulations, Kane. Thank you, my dear. It would have been impossible without you. What happens now? What do you think? We celebrate Enjoy yourselves. This leaves just you and me, captain Burke. You can call me John and you can call me whatever you like. Really? I will let's get the celebration underway. Oh, baby. Oh, baby! Yeah, mm. Captain Burke, you naughty nautical boy. Anchor's away! Now let me get this straight, you are? Evel, sir. And you? Kenevil, sir. Evel and kenevil? They're code names. Not our real names not our real names of course. It's been a while since we've seen each other. Yes, sir, it has. Yeah, we haven't been around. We've been in the state pen. Penn state. We've been at penn state. Fresh outta college. Rah, rah. This is a photograph of special agent Lucas and federal agent edy stark. They are your targets. Wow, some target. We'll kill 'em no problem. Now, listen very carefully, you are to wait until they are alone. Do you understand? Alone, no other agents, no fishermen, no innocent bystanders, no animals, alone. Then you kill them. It's as good as done, Mr. Kane. Say, that's a beautiful pendant, Mr. Kane. Why, thank you. It was a gift from lady silk. Whoops. Ildiot! Gimme that! Do you see what you've done? Oh jeez, I'm sorry, Mr. Kane. That's quite all right. What, are you both still here? Come on, let's go. Morons, morons, morons. Sir, why do you use those chimps? Their assaults are incredibly messy. They tend to distract my enemies. I think I should take this into town and have it repaired. No, my dear, too dangerous. I'll send captain Burke. Some days, I hate my job. Kane has damaged Donna's credibility. Donna can take care of herself. And I'm here to take care of you. - Oh, really? - Really. What are we doing in a toy store? This time, we're gonna do it scientifically. Can I help you, gentlemen? Uh, yeah. What can you tell me about this remote-control motorcycle? Well, what do you want to know about this remote-control motorcycle? Does it come with remote control? Of course, it does. Doesn't it? It not only comes with remote control. It's cordless. So tell me, are the instructions easy to follow? Oh, yeah, easy, lots of diagrams, pictures. Are the pictures in english? 'Cause we only buy American. Zimmy? In that case, we better go yamaha. That doesn't sound American sure, it is. It's made in yamaha, Oklahoma. Well, what's the difference between this one and that one? Well, with this one, when you visit Oklahoma, you get a complimentary beverage. We'll take it uh-uh, are batteries included? For you guys, I'll take the batteries out of the smoke alarm. You see? You just got to know how to bargain with these people. Well, there are no clues here. All the other guests check out clean as a whistle. I know it was Kane there's no way that he can sell the Alexa diamond without breaking it up and then greatly devaluing it. No, we're missing something. You must admit, pulling off a diamond heist is a little out of character for Kane. I only wish we could get in touch with silk. Bruce Christian. Bad news, Bruce. The explosion two days ago at the base of haleakala, the body was identified by dental records. It was dr Emerson that black model helicopter I saw last night at Chang's, it looked like one of Emerson's. Shane, look! Kane's tracer is moving. He's no longer at his house or on a yacht. He's ashore on Maui and heading for paia. Thanks, Ava. We'll get right on it. Someone should watch Kane's boat. He may be acting as his own decoy. I'l watch the boat why don't you and Bruce follow the tracer? All right, come on. You frisk him. Get the cash, nice and easy. Hey you, freeze. Come on over here, slowly. What'd you got in that bag? Face down. Cover him. All right, get the watches. Hey, Phil, I can't find the, uh... Hold it, stop right there! You want to live? Don't move and don't follow us. You understand? Come on, let's go. Come on, get in. Damn Come on, come on! Hold on, he's changing direction. He's definitely in a car and moving fast. What a heist. - We did it. - Ah, yeah we did. This calls for a celebration. I want some black coffee and lots of jelly donuts. You got 'em, chief. And don't forget the beer. Won't forget the beer. There's no necklace I hope Kane hasn't find out about silk. Hi Any news? Not much Ava tells me that Donna, Nicole and Bruce are keeping track of Kane. Good. Yeah Smile. Nothin' like a little bubbly to take your mind off your troubles. Look, all I'm sayin' is homer Simpson is a better actor. What are you talking about? Fred flintstone is an icon of American culture. Homer is just another flash in the pan. Oh yeah, remember when he lost his dog? He cried like a baby. And those were real tears, man. Ah, come on, we got a job to do. Oh! Oh, I'm in love. You'll get over it, after she's dead. How can I kill such a beautiful creature? Just think of the money. Right. Come on. Hey, what's with the dune buggy? It's backup, and it's made in Honda, Massachusetts. But what about our complimentary beverage? With this, we get a weekend with miss Cape Cod. Oh, I love those sand dunes. Now, what exactly does this thing do? This is foolproof. - Foolproof? - Yeah it rides up to 'em, looks perfectly innocent, and then, ba-boom! So let's do it. - Wait! They're not alone. Mr. Kane wanted us to be sure they were alone. They're almost alone, stop worryin'. Now, watch this motorcycle fly. Danielle, hand me the shortwave radio. This Hawaiian music isn't doing it for me. I'm going to try and find something else. Turn it around, quick. I can't, not enough juice in the batteries. Great. What now? Well, keep calm. This 1s no time to panic. Oh, really? Well, just let me know when, okay? You can panic now. Let's go. Foolproof? I don't understand it the controls jammed. I'm never buying American product again. Right. Next time, we buy Italian. This 1s kinda cute, but I don't think it's worth anything. I'll just keep it for a souvenir. The tracker's stationary. Now according to this, they're somewhere out there in that brush area. I don't know about this what's Kane doin' in there? I don't know, but we got to check it out. The grenade? You never know Terminator Who is it? Candy gram. These guys don't look like they work for Kane. They don't. Congratulations. We just solved the jewelry hold-up. Damn I'll notify the police. Okay. Yeah Shh. I better check on that. Ah! Just relax, Mr. Kane. Why, my dear, po, what's the occasion? Good afternoon, Mr. Kane. I've looked forward to meeting you face-to-face, for a long time. I assume this is the lovely silk you've told me so much about. Yes, a trifle impulsive, but a delightful girl, nevertheless. May I see the diamond? Clearly, your famous intelligence and expertise does not extend to the field of jewelry. A fake? Good, but definitely not the real thing. It was all some sort of setup. You must have known I was wearing a bulletproof vest when you came to my room in Las Vegas. Your caution is infamous. Mia has brought a surprise. Donna Hamilton, you just can't stay away, can you? I'm getting really sick of you, Mr. Kane. Donna Hamilton, a great prize indeed. My mother always thought so. This does save us the trouble of picking you up. She's no trouble to pick up. You rotten... Tie them up. No, Donna hasn't checked in yet. The coastal patrol reported that Kane's yacht has gone past kapalua around the north end of Maui. He's hugging the shore. I hope Donna's all right. We'll hit the coast road and shadow the yacht as best we can. Ava, contact Lucas and let him know what we're up to. Okay. And that's it for me, folks. And here's, Ava, your lovely midnight mistress, to caress you through the night. Boy, you guys look fit to kill. Dance contest tonight at edy's. And we plan to win. This is ksxy radio, molokai, Hawaii aloha, Hawaii, it's "Ava's loveline." Call me for your sex-trology forecast. Tonight, the solar end of the full moon places a focus on love and desire fire signs will blend freely with air. So if you're a libra, gemini, or aquarius, be prepared for the flames of passion to envelop your mind and your body. Call me, your moonlight mistress, for more alluring sex-trology forecasts. And the number is 555-ksxy_ Now the sensuous music continues on ksxy radio, the voice of the friendly isle. Aval Who was that man? I don't know thanks for dropping by, though. It 1s nothing, really. I had no idea that people's deputies are trained in combat. Why, yes. We're being trained in almost everything now. Is it possible that this changes your feelings about me? In America, anything is possible. Is good to know. Hello, "Ava's loveline." Hi, Ava, I'm a gemini, and I'm having problems connecting. Yes, I'm a gemini, too. Ooh! The stars predict that, tonight, all your fantasies can come true. Don't stop. I mean, don't delay. The time for loving is now. Here's a little something to get us in the mood. Do you know where they're taking us? To the estate of Chang, I'd imagine, to get the real diamond. They set you up to steal a fake. Chang gets to make his gesture without actually giving up the real diamond. I see where it's all headed now it's actually quite brilliant. I get killed resisting arrest. They never find the diamond. The diamond then goes to my former partner, po. What's more, they embarrass the Russians and humiliate the American secret service. The secret service has been humiliated enough, for one week. Why are you so interested in the diamond? Do you remember the name of the German officer who stole the diamond from stalingrad? Rohr, wasn't it? That's right. , Ms. Hamilton? A little rohr is German for walking stick, cane. Kane, he was your father? My father met Chang in south America. Chang was an exiled Chinese warlord, my father, an exiled German officer. They became friends. My father made the mistake of confiding in Chang about the fabulous diamond he had stolen from the Russians. Chang murdered my father and mother and stole the diamond so you wanted revenge on Chang. That's all I've ever wanted Chang is rich and powerful. I had to become rich and powerful. It would seem, however, that was all for nothing. Donna, if we're going to survive, we're gonna have to aid one another. Deputy Petrov, committee chairman on the phone for you, sir. It's urgent. Gregor. You beat up on poor Gregor just to impress me? You told me you liked tough guys. This 1s not possible. In America, anything is possible. This could be a very unpleasant day. We can't give up just yet. You always managed to escape my traps. I'd appreciate it if you'd see your way clear of escaping this one. We'll get Chang and his jokers, but then, I come after you. I'll be disappointed if you don't. Untie them. Move along, Donna. Okay. Ah, the great po. I see you bring gifts to trade. Greetings, Chang. You have the diamond, as arranged. Of course, and after our business is concluded, you and Ms. Hamilton will be returned to your yacht, to die. I knew you were the son of Heinrich rohr, the first moment I laid my eyes on you. I have something for you to look at. Uh, shiwan! You missed your calling. You should've been a photographer. Why, thank you. Can you see the headlines? Federal agent and notorious arms dealer found dead on a luxury yacht love nest. Apparently, you killed each other over the diamond. Finally, I will be rid of you, Kane. I only regret that I overlooked you when I killed your parents. My only satisfaction is that I see you die a fool. This man is a former associate of mine, a smuggler and an arms dealer. He's no more an emissary of the Chinese government than I am. The ravings of a condemned man carry no truth. You have seen my credentials. I've seen them, too, exquisite forgeries, really, made in Hong Kong, I believe. Think about it, Mr. Chang. Would red Chinese agents on a covert mission in the United States run around with red stars on their uniform? Treachery, traitor! I only wish I could have pulled the trigger. Fool, you're next. Get the diamond. Let's go. Blu, the diamond! Let's go! Cover me, I'll pilot this craft. Here, take this. Screw you. Donna! Your timing was perfect. How'd you know where I was? The coastal patrol tailed Kane's yacht for us. What happened to the diamond? Oh, that's a relief. (Rocket whizzes Come on, come on. Yeas! Ah, cover me. Okay. Not like that. My yacht! Yes. Good shooting. My work is done here. Norm will fly you to Honolulu in time for you to catch your flight to Moscow. I never thought I would see it. It's all yours now. A thousand thanks goodbye, sweet Ava. Is it possible that I will see you again? In America, anything is possible. Kane's still out there somewhere silk will put the tracer back on him. If he starts anything, we'll know about it. I have a feeling he won't be giving us any trouble. Really, why? Well, now that he's avenged his family, I think he'll go straight. You're a real romantic. I guess so. Donna, this just came for you. Next time, Donna Hamilton. Next time, Mr. Kane. I've managed to retrieve this for you. Oh, you're so good to me. Thank you. It's amazing. I've lost everything, my reputation, my diamond, my yacht, and there's a balloon payment due on my house next Tuesday. Now that I have nothing, will you still love me? Of course, I'll still love you. I'll miss you, but I'll still love you. - There she is. - Guys. - Donna, all right. - Hi, Donna. Congratulations on a job well done, everybody. Cheers. - Yes! - Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers.
