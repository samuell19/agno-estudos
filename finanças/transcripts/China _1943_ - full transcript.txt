(upbeat music) (airplane engines roaring) (bombs exploding) (speaks in foreign language) (women screaming) (speaks in foreign language) (guns firing) (bombs exploding) (gun firing) (bombs exploding) (woman screaming) (speaks in foreign language) (bombs exploding) (baby crying) (guns firing) (bombs exploding) (baby crying) (guns firing) (bombs exploding) Mr. Jones. Now what did I have to take you up for? Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones. (speaks in foreign language) (bombs exploding) (dog barking) (bombs exploding) Hey, have you seen Mr. Jones? Your Mr. Jones has gone. Where, who'd he go with? A woman from the North, the one with yellow hair. Even at a time like this. (gentle music) Hello, Johnny. Hello. What's that? It's a baby. What'd you think it was, Donald Duck? Drunk? No. So tired, almost at once he fell asleep. Three days and three nights we've been burning up the road with him doing most of the driving. (gentle music) Here, hold him. Come on, he won't bite you. (gentle upbeat music) Come on, give. (gentle upbeat music) It's about right. What's that for? You'll be needing it. All right. Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones. Go away. Come on, boss, wake up. What's the matter Johnny, the house pinched? Look, Mr. Jones, let's scram outta here. (bombs exploding) What's that? Bombs, Mr. Jones, bombs. They're bombing the town, killing people, blowing the daylights out of all creation. The jets. (bombs exploding) If you wanna make the coast, let's go, I got the truck outside. It is a good thing what John is saying. Go while there's still a road left to drive on. What's that? A baby. Since when? No, just a friend of Johnny's. I sort of found him. Him, huh? Yeah. No, I mean, holy smokes, Mr. Jones, I don't know yet. Come on Johnny, let's show up. Wanna come along? No. (bombs exploding) Things are getting pretty hot. All the years I can remember, I've been getting out of places because they were hot. This time I think I'll stay. Jones. Mr. Jones. [Mr. Jones] Yeah. Somebody here to see you. Mr. Jones? Mr. David Jones? Yeah. I present the commerce captain, Tao-Yuan-Kai, Intelligence Department of Chinese Sichuan Army. Captain Tao would like to see you. Well now, look, Mr. I got business in the Shanghai. I got no time for visiting. Captain Tao would like to see you. Okay. Want me to come too, Boss? No, you stay with the truck. - And Johnny. - Yeah. Ditch that kid. (guns firing) (bombs exploding) Everything in order. Yes it is. And I regret Mr. Jones, that you are an American citizen. Because if you were one of my own people, I would have to be shot for aiding the enemy. I can't do that, however, because even though the American people are not at war, they are our friends. Though sometime I think it's a curious right and left-handed friendship. For one hand, they give us food and medicines. But with the other, they permit men like you to sell oil to the enemy, for the planes to kill our people and destroy our towns. Mr. Jones, are you aware that the Chinese people are at war with Japan? Oh I'd say you're at war, that's your business. Mine is selling oil. If the Japs want it, it's still my business. With the prices they're offering, it's good business. Can you give me my passport, I got places to go. Can you give me some more of that tripe rosseto? That's all Mr. Jones, all but trying to forget that I haven't ever met you. (gentle music) (truck horn honking) (gentle music) An Intelligence Department. Who does that guy think he is? Captain. Captain. That's the trouble with those guys. You give 'em a dime a dozen education, teach 'em to eat ham and eggs and look what happens. They think they are somebody. It's raining. (gentle music) Come one, get off of here. (gentle music) Bombers. Hear 'em? (bombs exploding) Look ahead. (suspenseful music) (baby crying) What's that? Baby, Mr. Jones. Must've waked up. Come on. Atta-boy. Atta-boy. I though I told you to get rid of it. (gentle music) You ever tried to give away a baby, Mr. Jones, especially a Chinese baby? I tried to but everybody seems to have plenty of 'em. Haven't they fellow, huh? You hungry. Yeah. I got a surprise for you, yeah, I got it. (gentle music) What are you feeding it? Sugar. It won't hurt it none. I mean give it the gripes or anything yeah. Don't give him too much. Oh, what are you asking me for? Tough guy. (laughing) Oh, that's good, hey? Good. (gentle music) (truck horn honking) Better take it easy, Boss. Nurse the baby, I'll do the driving. [Johnny] Mr. Jones. [Mr. Jones] They'll get outta the way all right, I know what I'm doing. (truck horn honking) (suspenseful music) You all right kid? Oh, don't beat your brains in. You woulda killed somebody. (people yelling) (speaks in foreign language) What do you want? (speaks in foreign language) Get outta here. (speaks in foreign language) Hey, they quit. Sure, with your speed and my wit, they didn't have a chance. You're wrong, Johnny, somebody called them off. What do we do now? Better get in the truck before they come back. Put out those lights. You there, you in the truck, turn off those lights. Didn't you hear me? Yeah. Well turn off the lights. Lin Wei. Yes, Miss. Now what? You stay right here and wait for me 'til I get back. And you wait too. Who's the boss lady? Very nice lady. Yeah. I got an idea, we're gonna wait. Sure we are. Let's get it out of the wet, we can do that just as well in there. All right, we can go now. Lin Wei, you ride the front fender, if you see any bomb craters or any other trouble, signal me with this flashlight. Yes, Miss. Hey, I'm not driving this road in the dark. Nobody asked you to. The Chinese have a proverb, "Rather than curse the darkness, use your eyes." Lin Wei, all right? [Lin Wei] Yes, Miss. Move over please. All right, I'll take a chance. You're not taking any chance. I know this road like the back of my hand. I was born in that town back there. (truck engine revving) Say, if you got your date book, you can put be down with the Jones'. David Llewellyn Jones. Wait a minute, on second thought, you better probably with the A's, on the front page. Me too, I'm Johnny Sparrow. Hello Johnny. I'm Carolyn Grant. Glad to you know you. You know, the first thing we're going to do is buy a drink. Yeah, if it hadn't been for you, we'd still be under the truck. Those thugs almost took over. They were not thugs. They were just poor, frightened people who are bombed out of their homes. Where you headed for? Chungtu. Chungtu. That's a long stretch. Yeah, I'm afraid it is. Got relatives in Chungtu? No, but there's a university there. That's where all the students go, from the bombed out areas. I think I can be of some help. You see I'm a teacher. (baby crying) Miss. Grant, would you like a baby? (truck engine revving) Want me to drive? Ah, ah, I'm okay. The way this trucks dragging you'd think we had a load? We have, they're jammed in back there, like it was a hayrack. Jammed into where? Back there, the people that got on back at the bridge. (truck engine revving) Wait a minute. What are you doing? Hey, you better get back in the truck. Why? Because I'm just about to deposit some passengers and things are liable to get rough. You mean you intend putting them out here? Sure I am. For the simple reason of between here and Shanghai, there are models. I got just enough gas, but with a load like this, I'll never make it. You can't be serious. Now you take my advice and get back in that truck with that baby. I'll take care of my business. This is my business too. This riff-raff? They are not riff-raff, they're very fine people. I told you I was born in that town back there. These are all friends of mine. Well now look lady, all I've got's a two ton truck. You can't run that on the nook of human kindness. If we intend to get there, they gotta get off. I'm sorry, Mr. Jones, but if you put them off here, I'm staying with them. Okay, if that's the way you want it. All right, come on, get out of here. Come on. (woman crying) All right, everybody, come on, get out, get out, come on. Get up. You all right? (woman crying) Who's this? One of my students. Any more in there? Yes. [Mr. Jones] Who put them in here? [Carolyn] I did. What's going on back here? Take a look. Not bad. I don't know how you do it, Boss. Why didn't you tell me this before? 'Cause I was pretty sure you wouldn't let them ride. I've forgotten how much trouble an American woman can be. Mr. Jones, Sir. Yeah? We must proceed with our journey. Please get into the truck immediately. Now look, you get back in the. Or you must excuse me, if I blow your head off. (gentle music) Hey, come on, get this junk out on the road. You hear me? Lin Wei, tell him to get this stuff off the road or I'll knock it off with the truck. Who is this gentleman? An American who sells oil. Some of our women are riding in his truck. (gentle music) This isn't a good road for you to travel. But why not? 10 miles back from here, Japanese troops are passing through Shanghai. How do you know? It's our business to know. And the enemy patrols behind you. So what? The Japs haven't got anything on me. I'm an American citizen and I got a pass. So you get that bunch of junk off the road and I'll go through. How about these girls? Will they get through on your pass too? That's my headache. I'll think of something. It's too bad for our women that you weren't at Nan King to think of something. Wait a minute. With the Japanese so close, what do you think we better do? Take that road. Yes. Then afterwards, do what he says. (whistle blowing) What's that for? That's a signal that the enemy has been cited. If you're going, you'd better go quickly. Come on, let's get outta here. I'd better ride in the back of the girls. You get in the back with the kid too. Right. (gentle music) (truck engine revving) (suspenseful music) (truck engine revving) (truck horn honking) (speaks in foreign language) (bomb exploding) (suspenseful music) (guns firing) (truck engine revving) You know those two guys back there? Very well indeed, they are my first and second brother. Men of very complicated imaginations. Cut out the double-talk. Sometimes when thoughts come to me, I speak them out loud. It's the most discourteous habit, Mr. Jones, you must please excuse me. I guess you figured out by now, I don't like you very much. Well, that's perfectly okay, Mr. Jones, I don't like you either. So you see our feelings are entirely mutual. Now that we got that ironed out, who are you? Third brother, Lin Wei, a medical student at the university, work with Miss. Grant, I also studied English. For an American, Miss. Grant has many unusual qualities. Mr. Jones. Yeah. Mr. Jones, if I ask you to do something, you won't get mad, hah? No, but if you start asking me once more about that. Oh, see, there you go getting mad again. All right, what is it? Well, it's about Donald Duck. Who? The baby. Miss. Grant and I, we sorta christened him. Kinda cute name, hah? Miss. Grant says that Donald has absolutely got to have milk. So do I look like a guy that's got milk? No, but Tan Ying says that her family. Tan who? Tan Ying, the girl you dragged out of the truck. Her father's got a farm up the road ahead, he's also got a cow. And you know, in China. Mr. Jones, cows don't grow on trees. Okay. Now all I have to hear is that brat has measles. Well, I didn't want to mention it, Mr. Jones, but since you brought it up, Donald's got spots all over his little. All over it. (gentle music) (truck engine revving) (gentle upbeat music) Father. (gentle upbeat music) Tan Ying. Mother. Tan Ying. Father, mother. Oh Tan Ying, my child. (gentle upbeat music) Atta-boy, here we go. Johnny, Johnny, I want to talk to you a moment. Okay. Come over here. Will you do something for me? Sure. I want you to help me persuade Mr. Jones to take us to Chungtu. That's kind of a large order, Miss. Grant. Besides, it would sort of put me in a spot too. Oh, would it? Yeah, you see, I kinda figured on being in Shanghai, myself, in a couple of days, catching a boat home for Christmas. I even wrote my mom. Oh. Oh well, nevermind. Come on Donald, let's get that milk. About my being home. Well, you don't need to let that bother you. Thing is Mr. Jones. You mean you don't think he could be talked into it, hah? Miss. Grant, have you ever wrestled a mule? Because when, well, when Mr. Jones gets his mind set on something, nothing short of beating his brains out will make him change it. Right now, he's got his heart set on Shanghai and well, nobody ever beat his brains out yet. There's always the first time, isn't there? Yeah. Yeah. And you were probably just the one that can do it. There's no, probably about it, I've got to. (gentle music) From here, the road runs like this and right here, unless it's been bombed, is an old temple. To get there in a truck would take about one day. This is a ravine. And right here, the road divides, this one is a two day trip to Shanghai, now occupied by the Japanese, as you know. And this one is a seven day trip to Chungtu where all these girls and carry on their work without any danger from the Japanese or their bombs. Do you understand? Yeah. You're in a spot, but so am I. In the first place, day after tomorrow, I have to be in Shanghai, I have an appointment that I've driven halfway across China to keep. And in the second place, driving you to Chungtu is out because I haven't enough gas. We can get you all the gas you want, can't we Lin Wei? Yes, all he wants. Sorry, it's still Shanghai. If you and the girls want to go as far as a temple, that's fine. Driving into Chungtu is definitely out. Take it or leave it. Mr. Jones, you say you have an appointment in Shanghai. Just how important it is, I don't know, but these girls also have an appointment in Chungtu, and their appointment involves the destiny of China. How could a bunch of girls involve the destiny of China. Would you please wait a moment and let me finish? These girls are students, they're just a few out of many thousands, they're being trained for a very special job, to educate millions of Chinese, to teach them how working together, they can build a new China. Mr. Jones, you and I are Americans, our forefathers fought and died for a new America, these people are fighting for a new China. And if we don't help them now, well I for one, am going to stop calling myself an American. (gentle music) She certainly said it that time. You will please excuse me, Mr. Jones, if I make it my business to see that you do not disappoint her. Some day, I'm gonna wrap a truck around that kid's neck. Take a pair of wings, pin 'em on Miss. Grant, you sure got and angel. You ever had any experience with angels, Mr. Jones? (gentle upbeat music) Here's something that'll make him smile. (all laughing) Isn't he a pretty child? Did you ever see such shoulders? Look how strong his arms are. A fine man, he'll be for some lucky woman. With the harvest of such strong, sturdy youngsters, China need never be afraid. What great help he'll be on the farm in a few years. But first he must be sent to school. He must be taught to read, to write, to think. People must be educated. There must be a new China. Quiet. Don't your books teach you to respect your elders? It is the old ones like you that have held China back a thousand years. Oh go on, you little toad, with that pudding face and clattering tongue, there's little danger of any man making you a mother. How can you talk like that? She's our guest. (gentle music) Outside with you. And see if you've forgotten how to ring a chicken's neck, kill two of 'em. Outside, I told you. Yes, Mother. (gentle music) (cow mooing) Atta-girl. Slow bossy. Hello. Oh, hello. Didn't he say he's back yet? No, I was looking for him. Do you know where he is? He's shaving. Oh. Mr. Jones has quite a temper hasn't he? Yeah, but it don't mean a thing. No? Nah, some dogs like that, they bark at one end and wag the other. (Carolyn laughing) Really pretty swell guy when you get to know him. Perhaps. How am I doing? Oh, splendid. Well I guess that's enough for Donald, hah? Yeah. I understand in America they milk by machinery, hah? Some people do. Cows don't like it though. - They don't hah? - No. Is it difficult milking by hand? Well, it's all in the touch. Some folks got it, some folks ain't. Oh. Me, I guess I got it. (both laughing) Cows I've milked are stretched from here to Klamath Falls, Oregon, that's where I live. Ain't never had a complaint yet. I bet they miss you. I don't know about them but right now I'm so darn homesick, I can burst out crying. But Johnny. Oh, it's just being on a farm, I guess. Got me all of a sudden. It's the funniest feeling. I wish I could tell you what it was like. Well, take the old lady here and the smell of grass in the early morning, fresh cut hay and pine needles on a hot day and the cool breeze coming up on a lake. Mix 'em all up with smell of hot corn bread and bacon frying, coffee. (gentle music) That's my home. (gentle music) Oh, it sounds wonderful. You bet it is. - Miss. Grant. - Yes. May we go in and swim? - Well. - Please, Miss. Grant. All right, girls, go ahead, it'll probably do you good. Hey, wait a minute, that's where Mr. Jones is cleaning up. Good. (gentle upbeat music) (girls laughing) [Girl] What do you think of that Mr. Jones calling us riff-raff. [Student] He's worse than a Japanese soldier. [Girl] That loud mouth, Mr. Jones. Did you see him when third brother pointed his gun, he collapsed like a bag of wind. That Mr. Jones is nothing but a KuChangchun. (all laughing) (gentle upbeat music) Oh hello? Mr. Jones, I suppose you heard what they said about you? Don't mention it. I'm so sorry you heard it. What's that thing they call me that KuChangchun. I don't think you'd be very pleased if I told you. That's all right, go ahead. Well then, a KuChangchun is a very tiny insect. No bigger than my fingernail. But for such a small thing, it makes a very big and nasty noise. So that's what they think of me. But in spite of what they say, I like you. Well, that's very kind of you. Of course. I know that appearances are against you. And this is what I said to Miss. Grant, there's some good in everybody, I said, even in Mr. Jones. Well, I can't give you an argument on that. Mr. Jones. What I want to know is, when are you gonna kiss Miss. Carolyn? And what made you ask that? You've had plenty of chances. Now look, I don't go around kissing every woman I see. But you're an American, aren't you? Yes. What's that got to do with it? I've seen lots of American cinema and in everyone I've seen, the man that either kissing somebody or shooting somebody or both. And this is why in a minute, I'm expecting you to kiss Miss. Carolyn. If I were a man, I know I would. Kwan Su, sit far, in the back. There you are Donald. Oh, Miss. Grant. Yes. To keep him here would be a great comfort. With Tan Ying gone, we'll be very lonely. We've given you our daughter. So what would you please leave the baby to take her place? Did you say leave Donald here? Do you think it would be safe for him with the Japanese moving north? Oh, no one but wild animals would harm such a small one as this. Well, what do you think, Johnny? I don't know. I guess if we take Donald, we'll have to take the cow too, hah? Yes. Be pretty crowded in that truck with all the girls, don't you think? Yeah. I'm sure I'm going to miss the little geezer. I guess maybe we better leave him, hah? Well, he'd get much better care here. Bye, Donald. Keep pitching for me, hah. Don't you worry about Tan Ying, we'll take good care of her. Goodbye and thank you for everything. Thank you, Miss. Grant. Goodbye. Tan Ying, say goodbye to your mother and then hurry into the truck. You've been very kind to us, goodbye. Where to, Mr. Jones, Shanghai or Chungtu? Shanghai. That goes for everybody else too. Now get the vendors on board and let's get outta here. All right, come on, let's go. Let's go folks, all aboard. [Tan Ying] Bye Mother, bye Father. All right, Tan Ying, atta-girl. (truck horn honking) (truck engine revving) Bye-bye, take care of him. (truck engine revving) (baby crying) (truck engine revving) Much better. I'm afraid I am rather a mess. I don't mean that. You using lipstick is like a traffic cop powdering his nose. What's that got to do with it? You just don't act like the lipstick sort. I know a girl like you once, she had an act in a circus, used to crack a whip and make lions jump through paper hoops. And you prefer the lipstick sort, hah? Yes, mostly, because I don't like jumping through paper hoops. Well, I'm sorry if I made you feel that way, I didn't mean to. Then quit cracking that whip. All right. Sure is lonesome back there without Donald Duck. Come on, climb in here with us. Thanks. You know that kid sure got me. Must be my maternal instinct or something. Anyway, I've been thinking after this is all over, how about my adopting? Oh, Johnny, that'd be wonderful. I think you're nuts. I am not. I can see the two of us right now, back home on my mom's farm in Oregon. I'd even give him my name, John Ellsworth Sparrow Jr. I'd be mighty proud to introduce him to all the folks. "Look what Johnny brought back from China." They'd say. Yeah, they'd say, look, all right. What do you mean? They'd wanna know who the father and mother were? Well, I could be his fa... (truck engine revving) What are you doing? I'm going home, I'm going back to my father and mother. You're a weakling. I can't help it, they're old, they need me, I should be with them. That's no excuse. You, me, all of us, we are sworn to dedicate our lives to the new China. You can't go back now. Just the same, I must go. (truck engine revving) Let's stop the truck, tell Miss. Grant. No, let her go. When they find out it will be time enough. (gentle music) (truck engine revving) I'm trying to tell you, this is my war. As long as America is neutral, I'm neutral too. If you're trying to recruit for China, you do it some place else, not my truck. Mr. Jones, I'd like to show you something. Here, take a look at that, I'll watch the road. Chiang Kai-shek. Yes. Who's the other guy? My father. They were great friends. I think they were two of the finest men that ever lived. You know when my father was a young man, he was very much like you. Same ideas, talk the same way. Thanks. He was arrogant, opinionated and completely wrapped up in himself. Oh, I thought you said he was a great guy. Oh, he was afterwards. After what? After he met Chiang Kai-shek. Then he spent the rest of his life working with him. I, in my own small way, am trying to do the same thing. You say I'm recruiting for China, well, I guess I am. Don't try to recruit me. Japs have always been good business. You can't expect me to hate 'em for that. As a matter of fact, I got a couple of pretty good friends in Tokyo. Hey, Boss, there's a Jap plane in the back of us, down the roadways. (truck engine revving) Girls get out of the truck, get off the road, scatter and lie down. Behind those rocks. Come one. Hurry up girls, get over there. (airplane engine roaring) Hurry up. All right. (airplane engine roaring) Get down, girls, get down. (airplane engine roaring) (airplane guns firing) (airplane engine roaring) Probably one of your little friends from Tokyo. He's coming back. (airplane engine roaring) Sit down, will you. (airplane engine roaring) (guns firing) (airplane crashing) That's a machine gun. Yeah, but who did it? Come on. (fire crackling) [Johnny] Mr. Jones. Hey, who shot that down. Did you? Yes we did. You guys really got here in a hurry. Did all right too. That was most usual. Twice before I have seen them do the same thing. - Mr. Jones. - Yeah. Mr. Jones, one of the girls is gone, it's Tan Ying, she dropped off the truck. If it's all right with you, Mr. Jones, I'll go back to the farm and get her. You'll what? Go back and get her. Miss. Grant says it isn't safe to leave her there. Well, she went home, didn't she? What are you worrying about? The Japanese troops may go there. Well, you left the baby there, didn't you? Oh, but that's different. Tan Ying is a girl and a very young girl. Oh, ten to one, the Japs won't even go that way. Well, that's a risk I daren't take Mr. Jones. I've talked to some girls who escaped from Nan Chao and I've also seen some who didn't escape. We simply got to go back and get her, that's all. She's right, Mr. Jones, we better go. Now, wait a minute, you talk as if going back to that farm, we're driving down to the corner drugstore. If you think I'm going to backtrack 12 hours. There's no use you flying off the handle with Mr. Jones. If you say it's okay for me to go back, okay. But okay or no okay, I'm going anyway. All right, come on, get away from that truck. Take it easy, Boss. Somebody's going to get hurt. See, I told you somebody was gonna get hurt. I was going anyway. That clip on the chin was just for opening your big mouth. (truck engine revving) Where do you think you're going? I'm going with you. Tan Ying is my responsibility. Mr. Jones, I think you'd better take this along with you. Thanks. (truck engine revving) It'll be better for the women at the temple, I'm not leaving 'em out here to wait for the truck. How far away is the temple? It's about an hours march from here and we're starting now. Did you say march? (gentle upbeat music) (motorcycle engine revving) (suspenseful music) (bomb exploding) (chickens cackling) (gun firing) (suspenseful music) (Tan Ying screaming) (suspenseful music) Come on, let's go. (truck engine revving) What are you doing? I'll just slip in quietly. (suspenseful music) (Tan Ying screaming) Please, you English? Please, you English? No, American. Then please everything all right. Japanese and the Americans, very good friends, hey? Come on, get up against that wall. (Tan Ying crying) (gun firing) Come on, let's get outta here. (Tan Ying crying) Tan Ying, hush darling, you're all right. Hush up, you're all right now, Tan Ying, you're all right. Come one Tan Ying, nobody's gonna hurt you now, come on. No, now calm down, calm down dear. There you are, calm down. (Tan Ying crying) (truck engine revving) I just shot three Japs. Blew 'em to bits against a wall and I've got no more feelings about them than if they were flies in a manure heap. As matter of fact, I kind of enjoyed it. (gentle music) (truck horn honking) (gentle music) Hi, Boss, how was the trip? Come on, give me a hand. What's the matter? (gentle music) Kwan Su. All right, we'll take her now. (gentle music) What happened? There were three of them, Johnny. Poor kid. She got any chance at all, will she pull through? I don't know. What about Donald Duck? (gentle music) "The Lord is my shepherd, "I shall not want. "He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. "He leadeth me beside the still waters. "He restoreth my soul "and he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness "for his name's sake. "Yay, though, I walk through the valley "of the shadow of death, "I will fear no evil "because that word with me." [Tan Ying] Miss. Grant. Yes. In that book that you're reading, it says if we die, there's another life for us, is that true? Yes. Yes, those are the truest words in the world. You see Tan Ying, that's what our savior meant, when he said, if we believe in him, we shall never see death. You can believe that with your whole heart, without any doubts or questions. "Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me, "all the days of my life. "And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever." Tan Ying. Tan Ying. (all crying) How is she? She's dead. She didn't want to live. Mr. Jones, may I speak with you a moment. Now, look I'm in a hurry. I got three Jap machine guns in that truck and I'm gonna start using 'em. Mr. Jones, easy, my friend, easy. In fighting the Japanese, most of all, I have learned patience. Maybe you have, but I haven't. I can understand your anxiety to meet the enemy. Well soon you'll have plenty of opportunity. Not far from here there's a full division. Where? Let me show you on the map. They're advancing along this road, about 40 miles from here. How long will it take 'em to get here? Until dawn tomorrow. They'll get here sooner than that. No, they'll have to rebuild a wooden bridge, across the river. What do you mean rebuild a bridge, I just came across it. I've sent a second brother and some men to burn it. Over here, the road runs through a ravine. A days march beyond the ravine, is the flank of the Chinese Fifth Root Army. I have orders here that the enemy must not pass through that ravine. Yeah, and who's gonna stop 'em. We must. Oh, that's fine, 30 against 13,000. Well that oughta be a cinch. It would be very simple, if we could block that road. Then why don't you dynamite it? Already thought of that. But we need explosives. [Mr. Jones] The Japs are probably repairing that bridge by now, aren't they? [Lin Cho] Yes. Well they're sure to have some dynamite. So you get your gang together tonight and we'll get out and make a stab at taking it away from 'em. I'm going with you. Me too. It's all right for Johnny to go but not you. Lin Cho will need all the help we can give him. Unless we get that dynamite, not only are the girls endangered, but the Fifth Root Army will be outnumbered and runs the risk of being destroyed. Don't you see, there're only three of us who can handle that truck. And if anything should happen, somebody's got to drive it back. (suspenseful music) Don't take too many chances. I'll find a hole in the river and crawl in it. All right. (gentle music) Good luck. Thanks. (gentle music) Think they'll make it? If Lin Cho's luck holds up, yes. So don't be afraid. I'm not afraid. Not true, I am afraid. But it's a woman's fear. The kind that comes to them while they sit waiting and helpless. I know now, it must eat their hearts out. (gentle music) That's for Donald Duck. Good luck, fourth brother. (gentle music) Are you all right? Yeah. Where's Lin Wei? Is he badly hurt? He's dead. Come on. Come on up here. Where are all the others? They're gone too. (gentle music) Here you are, you'll be all right now. Sit down, Johnny. How'd that happen? I guess I got too close to a bullet. Same hand you hurt before, isn't it? Yeah. Didn't help by you trying to drive that truck. Oh, I smashed this hand so often, I got so's I could drive with my toes. All right soak in here for a minute. Miss. Grant. Miss. Grant, I don't know about you, but whenever I got something on my mind, I'm always one for cracking right off with it. Well, you're quite right, Johnny. If anybody has anything on his mind, there's nothing better than cracking right out with it. You said it. I've been that way ever since one night back home, I went on a hayride, it sure taught me a lesson never let any grass grow under my feet. Sorry. Does it hurt? No, I kinda like it. Yeah, there was quite a bunch of us on that hayride. There was also a girl named Mary-Lou, blonde, kinda on the heavy side, good looker though. Well what with the hay and the moon and a guy by the name of Clinton Pickens played on his ukulele, I got to feeling pretty good about Mary-Lou. I guess you know how it is, heh? Well, I've never been on a hayride, Johnny, but I can imagine a ukulele, a blonde, a full moon and some hay, sort of like playing with matches. Yeah, it sure is. Well the longer I sat there looking at the moon and holding Mary-Lou's hand and listening to that ukulele, the more I got the notion that I was crazy enough about Mary-Lou to ask her to marry me. I guess you can understand how I felt, hah? I guess I do. But if it had been me, I'd have started running right then down the road, looking for a preacher. There you are. You would? Well that's what I oughta have done. I oughta never waited 'til after the weenie bake. 'Cause after the weenie bake, when I got around to asking Mary-Lou to marry me. She promised to marry somebody else. Yeah. And I'll bet you anything you want that it was a ukulele player. How did you know? Oh Johnny, women just know things like that. Sure taught me a lesson though. Sure taught me that if ever I get crazy about a girl again, the thing to do was to come right out and tell her. Well you're absolutely right. And someday you'll find a very sweet and lovely girl, who's going to make you very happy. That's why I'm telling you now, I'm crazy about you. And I'd think myself, the luckiest guy in the world, if you'd marry me. Johnny, Johnny, you're awfully sweet. Is it okay then? No, I'm sorry, I'm afraid it isn't. I was so afraid of that myself. Guess it's no use of me trying to sell you on the idea then, hah? (gentle music) Well, if you should ever change your mind, I live in Klamath Falls, Oregon, you can always reach me. If I ever do change my mind, Johnny, I certainly will let you know. (gentle music) Thanks for asking me. (gentle music) How's your hand? Oh, fine, only thing worries me is how am I gonna wind my watch. Got to go to the truck, will you come, I'd like to talk to you. All right. (gentle music) When a pint size kid Lin Wei, with his ribs showing and nothing but a knife between his teeth can sail into something like that, I know everything's gonna be all right. You know, I liked that kid. How do these work? Well, it's very simple. Put these on the side of the ravine, take this wire and hook it onto this. Then we kick it off. Oh. Then little Hirohito's men, have got more dirt on 'em than they can dig out of in a week. You know how to send these as Christmas gifts. Who's going to do it? I am, I guess. While Lin Cho and his brothers string out the wire. Well isn't there anyone else who? I mean besides you. Who, for instance? Outside of Johnny, there's only three of us left and Johnny's hand's no good. Yes, of course. When's it going to be? Just before sunup. We haven't got much time, have we? No. (gentle music) We can't measure things by time. Why our whole life could be lived as beautifully in five minutes as they would have lasted a hundred years. And then it could be lived a hundred years without the memory of one single moment of happiness. Yeah. I never thought of that. I meant to tell you something. Down at that river, all I could think of was you. When things got hot, I made a vow. Just like some men who swear they'll burn a candle before the shrine of the Patron Saint. That's what women do too. Tonight, wherever men are in danger, they are lighting candles, even brighter than the stars, but not in shrines, in their hearts, for men they love who've gone away. Yeah. That's the light that'll bring those men home. Do you wanna know what that vow was? Oh yes. Well, I swore that if I came back alive, I'd come back to you and tell you that I loved you. (gentle music) Are you asleep? What's it like to feel a little drunk. Wonderful. Then I think I'm a little drunk. (gentle music) Good. Do you know that you have a little bump, right there in your nose. It was broken. How'd it happen? Oh it's too, sordid a story. Tell me. You're too young. Please tell me. Well, it involves another young lady. (gentle music) Was she pretty? She was sensational. Had a twin sister too. Were you in love with her? Madly, with both of 'em? (Carolyn laughing) That must've been a little confusing. It was. The only way I could tell 'em apart was one drank scotch and the other drank beer. One night, I took one of 'em out, and we stopped for drink and that's where I got my wires crossed. How? Without thinking, I ordered beer and when it arrived, she threw it in my face. How could that break your nose? She forgot to take it out of the bottle. (Carolyn laughing) I think you're just making up the whole thing. It's really an operation for adenoids. (Carolyn laughing) (truck engine revving) Where do you have to go? Up there on the edge of the ravine. [Carolyn] Oh, I see. [Lin Cho] The detonator, Mr. Jones. You figured on a Jap patrol ahead of the column, haven't you? We will take care of them. Good luck, fourth brother. Thanks. Oh, Johnny, you wait 20 minutes after the explosion, we don't show up, you clear outta here fast. Take the girls to Chungtu. Is that all, Boss? Take care of yourself, you big lug. (gentle music) Well this is it. Yes. Look, there's one thing I want you to know before you go. I love you with my whole heart and I always will. (gentle music) God bless you, darling. Cross your fingers. I will. (gentle music) We'll plant some more up there. Do you hear that? (suspenseful music) [Lin Cho] It's the enemy. They'll be in the ravine and through before we can plant the rest of the charges. You know how to set them? Wire them and hook 'em up with that plunger, like I showed you. How quickly can you do it? In 15 minutes. - You got a watch? - Yes. Good, I'll go down and stall 'em off. Remember though, you gotta kick her off in 15 minutes. There can't be any ifs or buts. (suspenseful music) Here they come. (suspenseful music) (truck engines revving) (gun firing) (suspenseful music) (truck engines revving) Good morning, General. Oh, I suppose you don't speak English. All Japanese staff officers speak English. But nevermind the social amenity. Be good enough to explain why you're delaying an entire mechanized division of his Imperial Majesty's army? Well I'm out of gas. You see, I got a truck, a couple of miles down the road. Would you mind showing me your credentials? Oh sure. Do you, by any fortunate chance happen to have an American cigarette? Oh, sure, sure, sure. Here. Thanks. I spent many years in your country and I have acquired a taste for them. Oh, well, here, here, take the whole package. I wouldn't dream of depriving you a pleasure, so hard to come by. Oh, come on, you'd be doing me a favor. Well a thousand thanks. We have two minutes and a half left. You must believe me when I say that contrary to popular belief that the Japanese people have always held your country in greatest esteem. Well, that's fine. Yes, they like it so well that they had finally decided to take it away from you. You don't say? In fact, we have already moved toward that aim. I don't get you. It will be a pleasure to enlighten you. Good. Briefly it is this, at this very moment, your warships are at the bottom of Pearl Harbor. Your planes were destroyed before they were able to take to the air. Your defenses and the city of Honolulu are a smoking shambles. And you're dead, by the thousands, litter the streets and the beaches. And the fate of Pearl Harbor will be the fate of all so-called free democracies who dare oppose the Imperial Japanese Government. Because we and our allies for the ultimate good of all nations concerned, have determined to establish a new world order. You think so, hah? In a year it will be history. It'll never work out. If you give me a couple of minutes, I'll tell you why. To find out why is worth a couple of minutes. General, in all the countries that you and your gang have put the finger on, there are millions and millions of little guys, just like me, little guys who have never amounted to much. But all living our lives, and they're pretty much the same pattern. And the pattern of our life is freedom. And it's in our blood, giving us the kind of courage that you and your gang never dreamed of. And in the end, it's that pattern of freedom that's gonna make guys like you wish you had never been born. That's all, brother. (gun firing) (bombs exploding) (man screaming) (suspenseful music) (truck engine revving) (gentle music) He was a great guy. (gentle music)
