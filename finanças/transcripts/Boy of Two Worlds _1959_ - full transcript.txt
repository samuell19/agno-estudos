Here is Paw's bag. I cannot find him. I'll find him. Come on, Paw. We'll be late for the train. Your aunt is at the station. Paw, you are now in your fathers country. I know it's different from your jungle. Doesn't Denmark look like a lovely country to you? No. I'm sure you will like it. They found him. - A little souvenir! - Thank you. - We're here to meet a miss Bo. - Yes, that's me. - Is this..? - Yes, it's Paw, your brother's son. I promised your brother before he died to bring Paw here. - He doesn't look like.. - He looks like his mother. Your brother met her in the West Indies. He loved her very much. Your brother was all right. He always stood by the natives. Unfortunately she died when Paw was born. So now he is all alone. Welcome. What was your name? Your brother called him Paw because he was so light-footed hunting the cougars. - Cougars..? - Wait for me! Goodbye, Paw. Look, daddy. There he is. My god, is he..? Walk on the stones, Paw. The grass is newly sown. Get away from my newly sown! Remember to wipe your feet. Your better learn at once. Put your bag in the hall. The third hook it yours. Your father also forgot to wipe his feet. It's 15 years since he was here last. Sit down, please. Don't sit there. I just washed it because you were coming. Your grandmother made it. - Is that the forrest? - Forrest..? - Are there many animals? - Yes, the birds eat all my seeds. Do you want your egg boiled 3? or 4 minutes? Yes, it's a big problem with eggs. Welcome, my boy. You're bigger than I thought. You'll join second grade. This is my wife, she takes care of the practical things, and I do the unpractical things. He's coming! Here is your new classmate. What was your name? Paw. We pronounce it different here. Paw comes from the West Indies and your father taught you Danish. Will you point out where you come from? Marius, can you show us where it is? That's his own fault. What can you tell us about the West Indies? It's where the West Indian apes come from. Inger.. Can you tell us something else about these islands? Danmark once owned some of the islands and we were the first to free the slaves because.. we think one colour is as nice as the other. You mean all races are equal! Hey, Anders.. Did you hear a shot? I heard two. I thought it was the gamekeeper. The poacher. Now he's at it in the broad daylight. Listen, keep an eye on him for me. Yes, squire, but I only know about fish. And the poacher knows the game better than my gamekeeper here. He's killing the deer we had to weed out anyhow. I will get to him. And I will keep my eyes open, I promise. - More coffee, teacher? - Four cups are enough. He'll come back when he's hungry. It's not easy to be planted in a new country. You know that from your own garden. At least you give me happiness. A hurt boy has only two weapons, to withdraw into himself or to flee. You can't put a wild boy like Paw in a cage. But people will talk! We must try to undestand him, he comes from antoher world. Didn't your aunt tell you to go to school ape boy? Hurry up! Paw, leave the boys alone! But daddy, they started. No riots here. Go to school. Your girlfriend will protect you. - Good morning, dad. - Good morning, my girl. The weather is too beautiful for mathematics. I'm afraid to get an F. I'll be back with the 12 o'clock train. There is the perfect angler who provides my table with eel. But perhaps a deer? You still think he is the poacher? - Jelly, Knudsen. - What do you mean? This time I want my eel in jelly. And if it was hunting season, I would like a duck as well. The poacher! It's the poacher! You are letting the guilty one go! He's in the forrest all by himself! What do you say, Anders? The poacher is bolder than I thought. You know people, Knudsen don't. Only a few people are. Goodbye. Sesam, what's wrong? Poor Sesam, your paw was caught in a trap. Lie down, Sesam! What did you just hide? A gun. - Where did you get it? - I found it in this tree. A strange place to hide a gun. Then why did you hide it? Me? You mean that you saw me without me knowing it? Many times, when you where hunting or hiding. Isn't that the policeman's dog? He was cought in your fox trap. I never set a trap in all my life! Someone set it before my time. Sesam, come here! That damned poacher! He got away. He must have smelled something. - Who? - That's classified. I'll tell you then. The squire told me to keep an eye on the poacher. - Don't tell anyone. - You can trust me. Happy hunting! You won't tell anybody? - Tell what? - That I played hooky from school. No, we'll both keep our secret. 18.. ..19 - 30.. - No, 20. No, no, 23. I only need 20. Have you been fighting again? Give me your pants. - I just need to.. - You're not going to the forrest. You'll do your homework. Take this. Not there. - Have you made you homework? - Yes. We always had homework, at least German verbs. Shut the window, there's a draft. Now I have seven eggs. There is the nigger boy. Let's get him! Come here! - Me? - Yes. - Don't you want to join us? - Yes, thank you! We are looking for eggs, help us find them! You can't take the eggs, there are babies in them. What do you care. Is it your birds? Who do you think you are! Leave the boy alone! He started it. Get out of here! You did all right. If your have to fight, choose someone bigger than yourself! He got what he deserved. Get going, boys! You can stay with us white your aunt is in the hospital. "Walk on the stones, Paw". I know the rascal or at least my son Mariues does. My suggestions is.. The orphanage. Coffee, anyone? We're not here to drink coffe. We're here to talk about a child! Not coffee! Nobody wants a colored boy. You take him yourself. I have to little room and to many kids. It's a pity Miss Bo had no money. Food isn't cheep these days. It's not cheap to have kids. Even though.. Wait a minute. I'm sorry to interrupt, but I would like to take care of Paw. That would solve the problem. The boy could help me fish. I work alone. He can move in straight away. I'll give you time to think. It won't cost the town a cent. He needs a woman in his house. It's a pity you're married already. I was only thinking about the food. And Paw. I vote for Anders. It's the easiest solution. But we don't even know him. Where is he from? And when did he came? He pay his taxes and he his rent regularly. Then everything should be fine. Now it's time for coffee. Where the hell is that coffee? Shall I help you carry the deer you shot? Two make more noise than one. But.. In this weather nobody's out. Only the fox. The fox is clever, always walking his own ways. When you always get hunted you learn to be careful. Anders.. See the footprints. They are mine. - No, they're ridged. - And mine are smooth! - They are quite new. - You little fox! The fox has stolen a hen. Little thief! I could smell he had been there. No, you could smell the scent of it. What nerve, stealing while we're huting. What's the difference between 'hunting' and 'stealing'? That's hard to answer. The sqauire own the forrest, so if you shoot a deer it's stealing. If an animal kills me, is that stealing a human being? You could call it that, but it makes no difference for the animal. - Do you have my beer? - Yes. You see, Paw, we all steal. You take the hen's eggs. The fox takes the hen, which are mine. And I shoot the fox, in the squire's wood. Nobody owns the jungle. And the animals belong to themselves. How do you know so much about the animals and the forrest? A have always lived in the woods, Paw. I was once a forrester in Sweden. More meat? Why no more? Anders? Many things in life you belive you own, Paw. Maybe a beatiful forest.. Or a beatiful women. Maybe a little boy like you. You can have everything, and then one day she and the boy are gone and the forrest belong to someone else. You can loose everything, Paw, life is rough, but you must learn to take life as it comes. - Where is my tobacco? - Here, Anders. There is the squire's daughter, she's at the boat. Go and ask her what she wants. Why are she sneaking around here? What are you doing? I've found an acient stone. What do you think it is? An arrow head. I'm glad I didn't live back then, imagine eating raw meat and oysters all day. Have you tried oysters? You will puke if you do. Overthere is a midden filled with shells. Midden? The stone age people didn't have to do the dishes. I wish I had your hair. - Why? - It's pretty. Father will like this, he loves everything old. Maybe I'll get black hair one day. That's right! Are you going to step into my shoes as an archaeologist? It's hereditary. What's that? Animal hair? - Are they also 5000 years old? - Something like that! Deer hair! We haven't shot a deer..? How did this end up in your handkerchief? Maybe from Anders' boat when I showed it to Paw. Did mother have the same margaine colored hair? Your mother had golden hair. So you think these hairs comes from Anders' boat? At least they're not mine. That's interresting. Good evening, Paw. Are you alright? Are you happy staying at Anders'? You, little fellow, won't you try? I think you should try. So who was right about Anders and Paw? This gentleman has won the biggest prize of the evening. Who else wants to try? Have a good trip home! - I'm late because.. - Nevermind, you are here now. So the little fox got a wet fur. It started to rain.. Sit by the stove and get warm. Did you meet anyone? Did anyone ask you questions, about me? One of the boys stuck a knife in your bikes tires. Nothing else? You are not angry? It never helps to get angry. But I'll get revenge. You may have to wait a long time. - Drink this. - What is it? It's my medicine for anything. Cognac. If only Miss Bo could see us now. Sorry, but this is how we do. Gee, it's hot. I heard the rain in the jungle is much worse? The animals don't like it. The animals have neither stoves or congac. We have a few advantages. - Anders? - Yes? Can I stay with you? Forever? - Do you like it here? - Yes. When I'm with you I don't feel so alone inside. It's not good to be lonely whether your are young or old. When you hear the rain and see the fire and have someone you talk to, then it's good to be a human being. Did you get it or was the gamekeeper there? I hope so! Where is Anders? Or your foster-father? He went out. He's fishing of course. Stupid question. - Do you what that is? - Yes, it's an "owl teaser". "Owl teaser", that's a funny name for a crow. Sometimes it's necessary to destroy uninvited guests when they ruin your game. But I guess your foster-father already told you that. Good morning squire. An unexpected visit. Good morning. Did you get it or was the gamekeeper there? I don't know what you mean squire. I just had a talk with your foster son. Should I make coffee? What do you use this for? - That's not mine. - I didn't say anything. I'm sorry Anders. But I think the police will want to talk to you about your doing in my forrest. I just found it, it's an old trap! But still dangerous. For old foxes. We had to take him here. A vagabond always fighting. He wouldn't say anything about himself or his foster-father. The psyciatrist couldn't make him talk either. But now you can try, Principal. It's not easy being different. You are going to stay here for now. Sit down, my friend. You'll have a good time here if you want to. I want to go home. You have to settle down here. Is there any work you would prefer? What about gardening? I want to go back to my foster-father. You'll have to forget about him. Please, can't I go back to Anders? Anders Nilsson has lost the right to keep you. Will you show him his room? Take you stuff. Goodbye, Paw. It will be alright. Paw! Wake up. - Where are your pliers? - I must have lost them. - Have anyone seen his pliers? - No! I must have lost them. You are responisble for your pliers. Next time you won't get away that easy. Go and get another plair. Don't even try. They catch you right away! Others have tried. Are you going to tell? No. But it's crazy! Have your seen Paw? Did he come by here? No. We haven't found him yet, we have searched the area. He must have been very fast. Looking for somebody? The door was open. - And you were just passing by? - Exactly. I have nothing to hide. Maybe you came for the last payment of my fine? It must be hard with your business closed and loosing your little partner. Paw has nothing to do with it! Have your heard from the boy? Then you don't know if he's okay? - How should I know that? - No, of course. Would you like a drink? I will get that little scamp. Marius, what's going on? It the police, they are after Paw. He escaped, but they'll get him with the bloodhounds. Is wish you were as good at spreading manure as gossip. - One more for you! - If you insist. - Paw, you've run away? - I wanted to go home. But my little fox, you can't just run away. I was afraid they had put you in jail. They just gave me a fine. Paw, you can't stay here. Wasn't I a good help? You said I was clever at smelling tracks. Little fox.. We have to obey the law. - You must go home. - I don't want to. Sometimes you can't decide for yourself. But you are grown up, you can decide for me. - He must have run away. - I'll take care of him. You can't, Paw. Why didn't you tell me the police was here? I can't help you. You must go back. Let's go, my friend. Don't make the stiches too big. It's your fault he is.. - Where he is now. - I know. Haven't I been punished? And now you ask me of all people to help you? - Who else? - What do you say? - It's your forrest. - Ah, like that. You mean I'm guilty because you poached in my forrest. The forrest is Paw's home. - My forrest? - Everybodys forrest. Since you took him away from me, nobody has offered him a home. Maybe they have their reasons. Perhaps because he's colored. Colored? I never thought of that. That's no problem in this country. Not until it knocks on your door. It's diffucult to understand. - Cigar? - No, thank you. Why did you choose this place? Sorry for being too frank. I can't give you a straight answer. But would you stay in a place where you've lost everything, home, wife, child. No, it must be diffucult to start all over. You try to run away from your past, but you can't. Then you get attached to a little boy, and make him unhappy. - Goodnight, squire. - Goodnight.. Poacher? You can call me that, although I've quit the job. - Daddy, I do like Anders. - What? - You have been listening! - You told me to listen when the grown up talks. I've also told you to go to bed! - Go to bed! - In a moment. I should never have left Africa. 'Times' is worried about the negroes in Africa. Is London worried about Paw too? Give them an inch and they take all of Africa. 'Times' is worried! I should have stayed there. - I thought you went to bed, Uncle Frands. - How can I sleep when Afrika is awake? What are you going to do? I can't handle everything. - You can start with Paw. - You should all stop talking about Paw! His case is finished! You talk like a politician. You deserve a spanking. Why are you so angry? I hate being asked to do what I ought to have done. You'll reconsider the case? If you are not in your bed in a minute, then.. Then what? I don't know. - Goodnight - Goodnight, Daddy. Paw escaped again! - Then he must be at Anders'. - No, he's not there. He's gone! I was told that he was getting along all right at the orphanage. So you called? Yes! You told me to. They said he was fine and becoming a tailor or something. - Paw.. A tailor? - I said the same thing. But it's to late to do anything now. - We should have done something long ago. - We? When you say 'we', you mean 'me'. You just gallop through life. Find the gamekeeper and send him to me. Yes, squire. Look, little fox. He won't hurt you. Any news about Paw? The police belives he sneaked aboard a ship. So they stopped searching for him? I heard that a dock worker saw a colored boy go aboard a liner. Did he really try to get back to West Indies? It would be the best for him. For everyone. I want you to know that I was against you getting Paw. I guess you were right. I also wan't you to know.. Even a teacher can change his mind. You should have kept Paw. Thank you for your trust. It doesn't help Paw. I?ve taught my children that coloured and white are eqaul. But after this I am having my doubts. How? I'm afraid it's us, that have a lot to learn before we become eqaul. That damned fox! Take care of the others, we'll meet at the boats. - Are we going to be wrapped up in cotton? - Yes, the air is chilly. It reminds me of that morning at Lake Victoria. You are leaving early! - Are you coming? - Yes, I'll hurry. Yes, it looks like that. As I said, I was sitting.. It was buffalos, I was sitting at the shore of the Victoria Lake. Then I was sorrounded by mad elephants. I saw a wounded duck, or at least I heard one. Paw! What are you doing here, Anders? I was scarring the ducks out of there, over to you. So the Landlord doesn't have to look. There are no one left here. Strange. It used to be their favourite spot. - You should follow my advice. - I don't want to. I know my own forrest. Nobody comes here. The ducks love it. No ducks left, you said? - I'll get it! - No, that's my pleasure. - I'll go swimming. - Okay. - Don't shoot between the trees. - Don't tell me what to do. Look, it's Paw! Let's get him. Help! I can't reach the boat. He's getting away! I think the other duck fell over there! The dog has caught something. What is that! A hut? And this? An otter! I haven't seen those for a while. Do you know about this? - Yes. - So that's why I shouldn't go here. So you're still a poacher? Yes. You couldn't deny with all this evidence. This time I won't tell the police, but now you must leave. - Leave? - Yes, from the cabin and the forrest. Dad! Dad! I've seen Paw. He's coming this way! Now I see. I judged you too fast. My back is broader than Paw's. - Hurry! Marius is after him. - I'll fix him. Will you help me, Anders? Hide, Little Fox. He ran through here! This is were he's hiding! He's not here. Look, he has stolen a chicken. Don't worry. We'll get him. What was that? Leave it alone! Come down! - You'll never get me down! - Come down.. or I'll shoot you! You seem to forget we're hunting ducks. Squire, I've just.. Yes, I hear you got a cold. - Have you been in the water? - It was him up there. How dare you blame God for your cold! Go home and change! - We almost chaught the black boy. - Who? The ape boy. Will you hold my glasses? Nice shot! Paw is hurt, I'll get the boat. Anders, come here. - We must solve this problem. - Yes, squire. So you continued poaching from here without any help? Yes, without help. And you even kept chicken here? And the otter is very valuable. This time you won't avoid prison. - Prison? - Yes, this is a very serious crime. - It's very serious. - I'm the guilty one! - Are you here, Paw? - Anders has nothing to do with all this. It's my hut and my chicken. I even stole a hen from Anders. You mean you outfoxed the old fox? - Yes. - You met your match, Anders! I see why you don't need anybody. But maybe somebody needs you? I don't believe that. I'll stay here. - But winter is coming. . If the animals can stand it, so can I. But it's much warmer at Anders'. - I've got my hut. - But you can still keep that. - You mean you won't send me back? - I'll need you here in the forrest. And then you poachers, can watch out for each other. Maybe you are a good judge of people after all. Perhaps. What do you say, Paw? Well, Paw. Do you want to stay in your tree or will you give the human beings one more chance? What about my fox. You can't shoot it. No, it will keep it's freedom too. Hey, it's my duck! - Where are you going, Little Fox? - To the forrest. It's home. And now we go home as well, Little Fox.
