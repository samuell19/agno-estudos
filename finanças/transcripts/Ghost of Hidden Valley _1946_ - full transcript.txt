* Charlie, start these cattle moving for hidden valley. I'll ride on ahead and tell the boss we've got 'em. Hi, boss. Hi, buck. Has that outfit from across the border showed up yet? Not here. Not yet. We brought in a nice bunch of cattle this time. The boys'll be along with them pretty soon. Good. This valley sure makes a good spot to cool off hot cattle. You're tellin' me. Unsaddle your horse. We'll bunk here tonight. We've got company. We can't have any strangers around. He's liable to see something he could talk about. Well, that takes care of that. And the ghost of hidden valley will get all the blame. I hated to do that. You ain't gettin' soft, are you, Dawson? No, I ain't. I just do what has to be done. But I don't have to like it. Phew! Well, that was a pretty tough trip. I'm goin' in to see if I got any mail in the last two weeks. Any mail? Who'd write to you, fuzz? Oh, I don't know. Somebody might. ( Laughs ) Hello, fellas. What's new? More rustlin'. But that ain't new. Another man disappears up around hidden valley. Yeah? Who was it? I don't know-- some pilgrim looking for a homestead, I guess. Boys found his outfit along the road, but he didn't show up again. I suppose you think the ghost of hidden valley gobbled him up. Maybe it did, maybe it didn't. Ain't no proof one way or other. No, sir, I won't do it. By George, I won't do it. No, sir. All right, all right, fuzz. All right. What won't you do? Play nursemaid to no half-baked, young, English gentleman just out of Oxford. Here. Read it. What is this Oxford he just got out of-- a penitentiary? No, fuzz. Some sort of a school. Oh, sufferin' catfish. Dud Trenton was all right, but I ain't got no time to waste lookin' after a schoolboy. Yeah. Fuzzy, what property is he talking about? Oh, dud bought the old hidden valley ranch years ago. Never done nothin' with it. Just let the place go to pot. It's a good ranch. If somebody'd knuckle down and work it. Whoa. Hey... ( Laughs ) Do you see what I see? Yeah. Looks like a medicine show. Or Henry. I better go find out which it is. Howdy, young man. Are you Henry Trenton? You have the advantage of me, my good man. Hold on. I don't want no advantage of no one. Fuzz, he means he doesn't know who you are. Well, why didn't he say so? I'm fuzzy q. Jones. And if you're Henry Trenton, why, I'm your dad's old sidekick. Pata always had such odd taste in friends. That's, uh... That's quite an outfit you're wearing. Oh, yes. Of course. It was designed after exhaustive research by my London tailor. I always make a point to dress correctly. I say, my good man, would you locate a vehicle to transport our luggage to the estate? Estate? What do you mean, "estate"? The pata mentioned having an estate called hidden valley. Y-Y-You don't plan to stay there. Certainly. Why not? Oh, the dog-gone place is haunted. And them ghosts ain't kiddin'. A lot of people have wandered out to hidden valley and they ain't never been heard of since. Don't be ridiculous. Most English families have an ancestral ghost or two. Pardon me. Oh, this is awful embarrassing. I say, sir. The inhabitants of this village seem a bit uncouth, don't they? Barbaric, tweedle. Barbaric! Quite right, sir. Quite right. What circus are you working for? I don't believe, sir, I have the dubious pleasure of your acquaintance. Well, don't let that worry you none. Where did you get that outfit? Take it off! Take it off! I have no desire to brawl with you. I shall be forced to summon the police. ( Men laugh ) Listen, son. It's gonna take a man to ranch hidden valley, and I don't think you're it. Why don't you go back where you came from? Ooh! ( Men laughing ) I wouldn't do that if I were you, mister. Why don't you mind your own business? I say, sir! Are you all right? Quite. What happened? Well, if you'll pardon me for saying so, sir, the blighter struck you. So he did. Yes, sir. Very good, eh, sir? Oh! Hey, why didn't you wait till I got back? You know I enjoy a good fight. Sorry, fuzzy. But our friend wanted immediate service. Looks like he got it. Well! Charming! Allow me, sir. I find this all very distasteful. Can we leave immediately? Sure. Throw your stuff in the wagon, and we'll get going. Surely you don't expect me to ride in that thing. It is very disgusting! Oh. You don't have to if you don't want to. You can walk behind. Henry, you'd do a lot better if you'd get that nose of yours down out of the clouds. Tweedle, get the luggage. Very good, sir. Howdy, miss kaye. Hi, fuzzy. I'm bringing in some new neighbors. Oh, meet Henry Trenton. I'm glad to know you. Charmed, I'm sure. Henry's dad was my old sidekick Doug Trenton, who bought hidden valley some years ago. Were you planning to ranch in hidden valley? I hope to make a go of it. Hello, miss kaye. Hi. Henry there's sort of new to the wild and Willy west. I never would have guessed it. He looks like a rootin', tootin' buckaroo. Well, I'll be seein' you. Bye-bye. Yeah, she's a nice girl. Well... This is it. Uncle Cecil did say the place might need a few repairs. Tweedle? Yes, sir? Yes, sir? Carry in the luggage. Oh. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Oh, dear. This is very depressing. Not a bit like merry ol' england. No. Tweedle? Oh, yes, yes, yes. The luggage, sir. Yes. Hey, Harry. You don't plan to stick around here and fix this place up, do you? An englishman, sir, is not a quitter. Meanin' I am? I made no such implication. Mm. Where shall I put the luggage, sir? I fancy there's a bedroom over there. Very good, sir. Henry... Your dad was a good scout, and I liked him. I wouldn't feel right if I didn't stick around till you learned our western ways. Go on, fuzz. Quit your stallin'. There's a lot of stuff to be brought in-- we gotta sleep here tonight. Hurry up. This place has got a hoodoo on it. I can feel it in my bones. A ghost couldn't find a better place to haunt a man than right here. Now, if I was a ghost-- you will be, if you don't shut up and go to sleep. I'll see to it personally. ( Owl hoots ) Hey! Did you hear that ghost a-screamin'? ( Owl hoots ) Th-th-there it goes again. Oh, fuzz. It's only a hoot-owl. I-- maybe it was a hoot-owl. Ah!!! Oh!!! What's the matter now? Th-th-there's a ghost at the window! What's the commotion? Think nothin' of it. Fuzzy was fed some local weed once by mistake. He goes crazy every once in a while. You'll get used to it. What a fantastic chap to have around. Quite right, sir. Now, you look here, Billy Carson-- will you shut up and go to sleep? I'm tellin' you there was a face in that window that looked like nothin' human. Fuzz, it's your imagination. Oh, my imagination, huh? I'll prove it. I'll have a peek. Glad you put that light out, fuzz. Yeah-- hey! I didn't do it! I didn't do it!!! You didn't do what? I didn't put that light out something else did! You didn't put that light out? You sure? Then we'd better have a look. Come on! Man. It looked like your ghost wore high-heeled boots, fuzz. It might have been somebody playing a joke. I don't know. Better keep our eyes open. Go on back inside. People just don't disappear into thin air, fuzzy. You gotta find the answer to all these ghost stories. ( Owl hoots ) What's the matter? Maybe this is where that hoot-owl hangs out. We got more important business than pickin' on hoot-owls, fuzz. ( Gunshot ) ( Gunshot ) That's the first gun-totin' hoot-owl I ever heard about. Let's go scout around. See if we can pick up that bush-whacker. Come on, fuzz! I don't see fuzzy, nor that Carson chap around. Perhaps that gunshot was their American idea of humor. Quite right, sir. Quite right. I'll find out who fired those shots and why. Come on, fuzz. Good morning. Good morning, miss. It's a custom out here, when strangers settle nearby, to drop in for a neighborly visit. Make 'em feel at home. That's a very jolly custom. Well, aren't you going to invite me in? Oh. Pardon my thoughtlessness. Please, come in. Oh, pardon me, sir. Pardon me. And, allow me, miss? Pull up a trunk and sit down. ( Laughs ) You are roughing it, aren't you? Temporarily. I'll purchase furnishings immediately. Oh, I brought you a little snack. Allow me, miss. It's my duty to set the table. Please don't be offended if I give you a little friendly advice. Carry on. Your clothes... No one dresses like that out here. But my tailor's an authority on proper attire. They missed the boat this time. Oh, howdy, miss kaye. Say, you're sure an early bird. I love to ride the early morning. Yeah. So does somebody else. Yeah. Some early bird was throwing lead at US this morning. Allow me to serve you, sir. Hey, I ain't cripple! I know how to grab my own grub. Was someone shooting at you? Well, if somebody wasn't shooting at me, it was a peculiar accident. Look at this. You were out on the range early this morning, kaye. Did you see anybody riding away from here? No. I didn't see a soul. I didn't even hear the shots. Would you mind telling me what this is all about? Yeah, I'll tell you. I have an idea that somebody doesn't want you to ranch hidden valley. If you do, you stand a good chance at being killed. Under those conditions, I can't ask you chaps to stay here and risk your lives. You mean you're gonna stick it out here alone? Naturally. Well, fuzzy and I haven't got anything particular to do. We'll hang around for a while. ( Laughs ) Won't we, fuzz? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. ( Piano player music ) Henry, you should-a hired yourself some hands. I'll see what I can dig up for you. Fuzzy, keep an eye on these two mavericks. What's a Maverick, ol' boy? Oh, don't pay any attention to him. He's just tryin' to be funny. Hey, let's go in and get a drink, and cut the dust out of our throats. Right-o, partner. I'll be happy to go. What, what, what. Hoo-ee! We'll have three beers. That's two beers. I will take that. Ahh! Well, then. Cheerio! ( Laughs ) Ahh!!! Boy, that's good! Rrroooaaaghh!!! What happened? ( Laughs ) One drink of that 40 rum and I could kick up a mule. But he'll come out of it all right. My word! What a fantastic country. Hello, boys. Anybody want a job? Whereabouts? Hidden valley. Uh-uh. Now what's wrong with taking a job at hidden valley? Maybe we don't like the scenery. My word! That was a most peculiar experience, sir. But I'm quite all right now. Yes, yes. That's fine. I'll go and see about our furnishings. Yes, sir. Oh, pardon me, sir. But would you mind if I engaged in that pastime over there? No. Of course not, tweedle. Go ahead. Thank you, sir. Hey, um... D-Do you know what you're doin'? Definitely. We often used to play for beans in the kitchen. Beans in the--? Well, I hope you brought enough beans with you. Those people are not playing for beans. ( Laughs ) That's what you're gonna find out. "Beans in the kitchen." Pardon me, gentlemen. Do you mind if I join you? Not at all. Pull up a chair and buy a stack. Thank you. Well, did you hire any hands? No. Hidden valley doesn't seem to be very popular. I wouldn't be surprised. Most everybody believes that talk about it being haunted. Maybe you're right. I don't know, fuzz. Hey, you oughta get a load of this tweedle over here. He's giving those boys a poker lesson. Hey, fuzz... Who's that stranger? The fellow with the moustache? I don't know. I never saw him before. I have. I've seen that face before, but I can't place it. I call you. What have you got? Ace-high straight. A-ha-ha-a. Just a minute. That is not sufficient. Well, what do you got? I have an occupied residence. What's that? A full house. Wait a minute. I think you're cheatin'. Sir?! I resent-- Where have I seen you before? I don't know. But you'll sure see me again. Come on. That's the outfit that plans to rent hidden valley. Yeah? Well, maybe they'll change their minds. Say, how do I get out to Dawson's place? Follow the main road to the fort, and then turn to the left. Okay. See ya later. ( Knock on door ) Dawson here? No. Uncle ed isn't home. I'll wait. I don't know when he'll be back. That's okay. I'm in no hurry. So Dawson's your uncle? I never knew he had such a good-lookin' niece. Have you known uncle ed long? Oh, sure. Me and Dawson are old pals. We used to be as thick as a couple of horse thieves. Hello, Arnold. I heard you were in town. What's on your mind? Hello, blackie. I understand you're doin' pretty good, so I thought I'd throw in with you. I'm not inviting anybody to throw in with me. That's okay. I don't need no invitation. Set another place, kaye. We have company for supper. All right. Supper will be ready in about an hour. She's a trim-lookin' Philly. You better not get any ideas along that line. Okay. I'm here on business. I had quite a nice set-up. I was owning cattle through hidden valley. A young englishman shows up. He's gonna ranch the valley, so that put a crimp in my game. You leave everything to me, and you won't have to worry about that englishman any longer. You don't use your head. I'm afraid you'll get me into a jam, like you did once before. I've played smart. No one has ever suspected me. Well, when I take a hand, I want fast action. You'll get fast action when you start dropping at the end of the rope. ( Laughs ) We'll talk about it later. Okay. Are you going into town tomorrow, kaye? No. I've taken over a new job. I've decided to teach the boys at hidden valley how to keep house. It may not be a permanent job. Tweedle, you're not beating out a grass fire. Take it easy and don't make so much dust. Yes, miss. You shouldn't be doing that sort of thing, sir. It isn't proper for the master. Tweedle, in this man's country, the master stands on his own two feet. And don't you try to undermine all my good work. Henry, pile that stuff over there. Oh, yes, miss. Wait till I get my hands on Billy and fuzzy. Good-for-nothing loafers. Sneaking out with the lame excuse that they have some very important business off the range. I'll bet they're taking a nap in the shade of a tree right now. There's no cattle on this ranch, fuzz. Just signs that plenty of cattle have been driven through here. Yeah, but how can cattle that ain't here make tracks? I don't know. I'm no good at riddles. There's no riddle at all in that direction. Where the border is. That could spell rustlers. Hey! That could be it. And it could've been rustlers that been hauntin' this valley. You're beginning to show signs of intelligence. Come on. Let's look around some more. I'd sure like to know what's going on over there. Well, we won't find out sittin' here. Fuzz, you're gettin' smarter all the time. Let's go have a look-see. You mean you're gonna sit around and let some English dude spoil a swell set-up like this? If you can't scare him off, there's other ways of gettin' rid of him. Hey, fuzz... I know who he is. Who're you talkin' about? The fella that started that fight at the poker game. What about him? He's one of the gang of vigilantes ran out of Cheyenne. They didn't have enough evidence to hang him. Wasn't any doubt that he was a killer and a rustler, and I can prove it. Let me have a peek. What this outfit needs is a man to run it. ( Gunshot ) ( More gunshots ) I'll hold them inside while you get the horses. Hurry, fuzz! ( Gunshots continue ) ( Gunshots continue ) Aw, let 'em go. We know where to find 'em when we want 'em-- and that'll be pretty quick. Well, there ain't none of 'em followin' US. I guess we gave 'em all they wanted. Don't fool yourself, fuzz. Hidden valley's in for plenty of trouble. Come on. You timed your return very well. The work is all done. Will you join US in a spot of tea? No, thanks. Henry, you'd better take miss kaye home. I say, old chap, she's my guest, you know. Why? Am I unwelcome? It's not that, kaye. We ran into a bunch of rustlers. I expect them to repay the visit. I'm pretty sure I winged one of 'em. You shot a man? Oh, I can't claim a bull's-eye. I only got him in the arm. He's perfectly right. You must allow me to see you home at once. I'd only be added worry if you did have trouble. Oh, Billy, try to see that no one gets hurt. I'll do the best I can. Cheerio. I'll be back in a jiffy. Tweedle, you'd better find yourself a nice gopher hole and dig in. But I say, sir, mightn't the gopher object? Oh, no. Not if you're real nice and polite and say "please." Oh, thank you. Thank-- oh! Won't you come in? I'd like to have you meet my uncle. It would be a pleasure, but I should be getting back to hidden valley. A few minutes one way or the other won't make any difference. I don't suppose it would. ( Footsteps approaching ) Uncle ed, I'd like you to meet Henry Trenton. This is my uncle-- ed Dawson. We had a previous meeting when I first came into town. Yes--and what I first saw of you I didn't like. Uncle ed! Why do you act like that? There's plenty of good men in this country without you taking up with some foreign dude. You're not welcome here, fella, so turn around and make tracks. I've no desire to inflict my presence upon you. And I'm very grateful to you for being so kind to a total stranger. Henry, I don't know what to say. I don't know how to apologize. You have no reason to apologize. It's not your fault. I'll say goodbye for now. Goodbye, Henry. Uncle ed, how could you do a thing like that-- insult a friend I bring to the house? On account of some stupid prejudice because he was educated differently from the rest of US. I know what I'm doing, kaye. I'm only thinking of what's best for you. You have a funny way of showing it. You treat the nicest man I ever knew like a stray dog. You're not in love with him? Yes, I am. And he's in danger of being killed. How do you know this? There's a gang of rustlers in hidden valley. Billy and fuzzy had a fight with them. Uncle ed! How did you hurt your arm? Oh. Uh, that. Let me bandage it for you. Leave it alone! It's all right. Hey! Holy smoke. What you got there? That, sir, is our hunting equipment. We may need 'em. All set? Yeah. The boys are all scattered out and rarin' to go. Okay. But remember, I want that foreign dude alive. I got an idea about him. Hey, look at that! Ohhh... I wish they'd start so I can get it over with. This waitin' around-- you got your wish, fuzz! ( Gunshot ) Henry, take this gun and cover that window. Fuzz, come on! We'll have the boys move in and finish this. I'm anxious to square things with Carson. ( Gunshots continue ) I say, sir, what shall I do? What shall I do? Grab a gun and cover the back. Hurry up. Right, sir. ( Gunshots continue ) Whoever's handlin' that shotgun is shootin' wild. I got an idea. Come on! Keep firin' at that window until I tell you to stop. Tweedle: Help! Help! Hold 'em off, fuzz! Help! Help! Hold it! Everybody! Get him on his feet. I told you we'd meet again. I noticed you didn't care to make it just the two of US. Why should I give a sucker a break? Throw 'em on our horses. We're headed for the shack. Fuzzy! Fuzzy, what happened? ( Laughs ) Oh... Where is everybody? I don't know. I-- tweedle! ( Tweedle moans ) Kaye, get me some water. Quick! Looks like you're hit pretty bad. You know why I brought you up here? No, I can't say that I do. To give you a chance to beg for your life. I'd enjoy hearin' that. You won't find it funny from here on. ( Laughs ) You could save your life by signin' this paper and high-tailin' it back to england. What's the paper? Bill of sale for hidden valley. Don't be fooled, Henry. Your life wouldn't be worth two cents after you sign that bill of sale. You keep your trap shut. Your life ain't worth two cents if you don't sign it. I'm givin' you a break. I'm sorry, but I dislike being coerced. Oh, get off your high horse and talk so I know what you're sayin'. He means he won't be pushed around, sucker. Dawson's got you fellas in a fine mess. When folks hear about this, the whole country's gonna be on your trail. I'll tell you what they'll think-- they'll think the hidden valley hoodoo's on the job, and they'll be scared stiff. That's what you hope. That's the way it'll be! I'll take care of you later. Throw him in the back room! Let's see you talk yourself out of this one, wise guy. I've had my say. If you won't listen, that's your hard luck. Stand him up against the wall. I have no particular reason to want to kill you. But you're in my way. This is your last chance. Which will it be? I won't wait all day. Start talkin' if you ever hope to talk again. ( Door opens ) Now you listen to me, Arnold. There's gonna be no more killing. Maybe I got somethin' to say about that. Are you a member of this outlaw gang? Yes. And it's lucky for you that I am. Turn him loose, boys, and I'll guarantee that all of you will have time to get out of the country. With money in your pocket. ( Whispers ) Hey! Psst, Billy! Get over towards the window and I'll cut you loose. I knowed they'd bring you here, so-- shh, fuzzy! ( Whispers ) So I snooped around till I spotted you. Turn around, Dawson. It's about time you found out that I'm runnin' this outfit. Dawson: These boys are workin' for me. And I'm still boss. I thought they'd killed you. I don't kill easy, but I've got a lump on my head the size of a goose egg. Hey, you'll probably need this. That sure feels good in my hand. What do we do now? You listen to Arnold, and you're in for a pack of trouble. Take it from me. I know. Raiding that ranch was a fool thing to do. Fuzz, you start a rumpus outside. I'll take it from there. Hey, save that buckswinger for me. I owe him a crack in the noggin'. All right, go ahead. Boys, a smart man knows when to cash in and quit the game while his luck is still good. That's enough chewin' the fat. Boys-- ( gunshot ) I said I was boss of this outfit. Any more objections? Start talkin'! You gonna sign that bill of sale, yes or no? I'll give you until I count to five. One... Two... ( Gunshots ) Come on. We gotta move fast! ( Gunshots continue ) Oh, the boys'll take care of-- hey, that English dude-- he's gone! Carson got away! Well, that's bad! We've only got one chance. It's a gamble, but we gotta take it. We'll high-tail it to town and tell 'em we trailed stolen cattle into hidden valley. And that Carson and the others murdered Dawson. But what happens when they start askin' questions? Whenever you start a mob with the idea of hangin' someone, they don't take time to ask questions or listen to reason. Come on, let's go. We just dropped in to see how tweedle is. He had a close call. I'm doing very nicely thanks to the young lady. That's fine. We'll go fetch the doc and have a talk with the sheriff. Uh... Miss kaye, your uncle, he was-- I know. I knew the truth when I saw his wounded arm. I was on my way here to warn you. He gave his life to save mine. I'm glad it was that way. Come on, fuzz. Looks like Henry's growed up. Yeah, he's all right. Now you know who's been doin' all the rustlin' around here. And they killed that Dawson in cold blood. Well, that's a job for the sheriff. We don't need a sheriff, mister. Men, there's only one way to handle cattle rustlers around here. And we could take care of that job ourselves. How do you men feel about it? All: Right. Yeah. Carson brought in that English dude to make the outfit look respectable. He figured by doing that, no one would suspect him of rustling. I think we ought to have more proof. Proof, huh? Ed Dawson is layin' up there, dead. Ain't that proof enough? I'm a range detective hired by the cattleman's association. Dawson sent for me to come and run down these rustlers. You men all know me. I worked a long time for ed Dawson, and he was as fine a man as ever lived. All: That's right. He was. Hey, the sheriff might be in there. I'll stop in and look while you go find the doc. Are you sure that's the only reason, fuzz? Well, he could be. Besides, all this ridin' has made me thirsty. Ain't gonna hurt me to wet my whistle, is it? Hey!!! Out of my way! There's the man I'm lookin' for! This is one of the rustlers, men. We'll take care of him and go get the rest of 'em. You'll take care of nothin'. ( Crowd murmuring ) Carson: Stay put, everybody. I'll drop the first man that goes for a gun. Now, turn him loose. I said, turn him loose. I just heard some talk about rustling. There's one of them, and the man that killed ed Dawson. Men: Yeah? How 'bout that? Now wait a minute, boys. Don't be fooled. He's lyin' about me to try to save himself. Yeah? His name is Jim Slade. He and his gang were run out of Cheyenne. Take off his shirt. He's got an "r" branded on his back. Take it off. I said take it off. You heard what the man said. Now, go on. Have a look. Men: Yep. There it is. He got off lucky. The vigilantes branded him and ran him out of town instead of hangin' him. You caused a turn, all right. We darn near made fools of ourselves. No harm done. Now get a lawful posse together, and we'll help you round up the rest of the gang. ( Bells chiming ) ( Wedding march playing ) I say, tweedle, old boy, ( clears throat ) How do I look? Awful. Turn around. I say, sir, you can't dress that way for an afternoon wedding. Who says I can't? My good man, it is not being done! Who says it ain't bein' done? I'm doin' it! I insist, sir, that you dress properly for the occasion. Take it off. Stays on. Take it off. Stays on! It comes off! On. Off! On! Off! On! Off! On! Off! I say, take it off! Take this coat off! ( Arguing ) Take that coat off! I won't take it off! ( Arguing continues ) No beetle or tweedle or anything is gonna tell me how to dress! I insist that you take that coat off, sir. I insist! You're not gonna talk much longer! I'm afraid I'm going to lose my temper, sir! You're gonna lose a lot more than that! ( Laughing ) Tweedle! Your feet! My feet, sir? Awfully sorry. I meant to Polish them this morning. Will you take that coat off, sir? I'll not allow you to sport it. ( Laughing )
