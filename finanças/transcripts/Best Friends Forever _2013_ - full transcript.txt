[ Wind howling ] No phone anywhere, but I found something better. Hi. I made friends. What's this? Um... That's my work. I'm an inker... for comics. I never understood why all the female characters in these things have to dress in such skimpy outfits to beat up bad guys. It's essential. Can you just give it back to me, please? Sure. Thank you. It just seems like such a male-centric view, you know? I'm Harriet. Right. [ Chuckles ] Forgot that part. I'm reba. Both: I'm Alex. I thought I was gonna be Alex. We can both be Alex. I'm kit. Isn't that a writer? Yes, I'm a writer. [ Retches ] [ Clears throat ] [ Sniffles ] I'm sorry. I'm just not feeling great. Quit being such a psychosomatic pussy. I'm not a psychosomatic pussy, man. I don't feel good. So, Harriet, reba says that you might be able to give US a ride. [ Indistinct arguing ] She did? Just up the road a bit. We really appreciate your kindness. It would, like, totally cement our faith in humanity. Reba, can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah. Why did you tell them they could come with US? They're a little weird, but they're musicians, so it's par for the course. I do not think this is a good idea. Okay, it's been a little while since you had a date. You can thank me when it's over. But only if you come. That's ridiculous. I had a date... Give me the keys. What is that? A taser. A what? A taser. It's a weapon. Give me the keys. I'm not giving you the keys. Dude, what are you doing? I thought only women carried tasers. Shut up! Come on, man. What are you doing? I'm getting US the hell out of this godforsaken country if these two bitches would just shut up and give me the keys! He's just being real squirrelly. You're being super-squirrelly. Just shut up, you guys. In case you haven't noticed, what we're doing is totally illegal. No, man, what you're doing is totally illegal, all right? We already agreed that there is no illegal anymore. That's what I meant. All right, man, but that's no excuse for bad acting to enter the equation. No matter the state of the world. State of the world? You two... shut up... keys! Do you have to yell, man? Some of US have splitting headaches. You're sick, too, aren't you? I'm not sick, man. I have a headache. I'm warning you guys. She's gonna give you the keys. No, I'm not. I'm not fucking around anymore! Give me the fucking keys!! Totally squirrelly. [ Taser gun clicks ] It was an accident! [ Groaning ] Sorry! You okay?! What the hell were you doing?! No, no!

Yeah, mine too. Let's go. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I think there was a gas station back that way. Yeah, but Austin is that way. It'd be stupid to go back that way now. Stupid? You know what's stupid? We just got carjacked, almost tased, and all your clothes are probably getting worn by three skinny guys right now. [ Sighs ] Sorry I missed the first class, professor smarty-pants. You wouldn't believe what happened to me this weekend. I wasn't quite overcocky. [ Chuckles ] Overcocky? Yeah. It means a totally fucked-up situation. Uh, no, it doesn't. It means when a bunch of dudes come all over a girl's face. My point exactly. [ Laughs ] You're weird. You're gonna miss me... Bad.

You want to know what's crazy is picking up three strange hipster boys at a deserted rest stop. That's crazy. You know, whatever. We wouldn't have been at that crappy rest stop if you weren't leaving me. What are you talking about? I'm not leaving you, I'm just moving on with my life. You didn't even talk to me about it. Yeah, I don't have to consult you. That's part of making adult decisions which you know nothing about. What? My god. Of course we end up here in the middle of nowhere because i'm with you and you don't... You don't think about the consequences. You just do shit. Because thinking has gotten you so far?

[ Screeching stops, [ engine idling ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Engine idling continues ] Hello? Are you okay? Oh! Aah! Oh! Ugh! [ Breathes heavily ] Are you okay or are you hurt, or...? No. No, i'm... I'm okay. I just thought... I thought I was gonna hit you. [ Breathes heavily ] No, I'm okay. You did great. [ Chuckles ] It's probably both of our lucky days. My friend and I lost our car, and no one stopped for US, so I-I just had to wave someone down. It was pretty stupid. Yep. [ Exhales ] [ Chuckles ] I'm Harriet. Sean. Look, I don't want to intrude or anything, but would you mind giving US a ride? Harriet, maybe this isn't such a good idea. Where you going? Somewhere with a phone? [ Engine idling continues ] Hello? Hop in. Gas station up the road a piece. Where you from? Los Angeles. No, I mean, where are you really from? Sean... Do you live around here? Where are you girls headed? Austin. What's in Austin? I'm starting graduate school. [ Laughs ] In what... your dreams? No, in information studies. It's interdisciplinary. It ain't happening. We should just get out. This is not okay. We could just walk. We are exactly where we're supposed to be. No secrets! I'm sorry. I didn't... I didn't mean to be sharp. I'm just a little stressed with everything that's been happening. Well, [chuckles] I guess since we just got carjacked, we have a little bit of a leg up on those stress levels. [ Chuckles ] You making fun of me? No. No, no. Why would I do that? Yeah, no. She's totally serious. You girls think this is a time for jokes? A time for fun and games? No, this... this is a time for reckoning. That's what this is. Why? Harriet. Isaiah. "The earth is polluted because of its inhabitants who have transgressed laws, violated statues, broken the ancient covenant. Therefore, a curse devours the earth." He knew it. Forest knew it. And he was righteous. I never doubted him. Never. Not once. Why are... Just nod your head. Secrets! [ Engine accelerates ] Going after the bases, if you ask me. Koreans. North Koreans. They're the only ones who can do it. Hey, asshole. I'm Chinese. Don't you have to report in somewhere? Yeah, I kept telling everybody about you people. [ Sniffles ] No one believed me. [ Engine accelerates ] Sean, um... Do not engage. I can hear you. I'm right here! Hey, Sean, do you think you could slow down a little bit? You think you can pull your sneaky shit on me? You done fucked with the wrong country this time. Now we are gonna bring the pain. Stop the car, you crazy piece of shit! We are gonna nuke your yellow asses back into judgment day for what you've done. You get that right? You understa that right? Fuck you! Aah! [ Tires screeching ] "Therefore a curse consumes the earth. Its people must bear the guilt." [ Horn blares ] Fuck you! You dickless sack of shit! We're gonna Bury you!

"Terror and traps..." [ Truck driving away ] [ Breathes heavily ] Where is everyone? [ Laughing ] [ Laughs ] [ Sighs ] I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that this is the worst road trip ever. [ Chuckles ] Yeah. Yeah. It's... terrible, actually. It's been a complete and utter waste of time. What? No. I... I didn't mean it that way. The funny thing is, i'm exactly where I'm supposed to be. Nowhere. Wait. Harriet. [ Door slams ] [ Crying ] [ Knock on door ] Open up. [ Sniffles ] Harrie. I got something for you. [ Knock on door ] Come on, harrie. Got to be better out here with me than in a gas-station bathroom. Okay, let me just say something. I know how important this is to you... And I know that it can feel... I know that it can feel dark sometimes. But I'm your best friend. And we're gonna get you to Austin no matter what. [ Door thumps ] [ Lock rattles ] Hey. Enough of this chicklet talk. Let's get wasted. Okay, but we have to leave them a few bucks for beer. [ Chuckling ] Ohh, please. This day calls for something a little bit less pussy. Ha ha ha! Go back to the candy pile. [ Both laugh ] Oh, my god! There you're also a doctor. [ Glass shatters ] Oh, my god! I'm so punk rock! Go back to the chip pile. Oh, my god. I should really clean that up. There you're a doctor, but you're a failure 'cause you're drunk like your father. Now, you go back to the candy 'cause that is where you turn the light on... Where you turn the light on... Die... [ Laughs ] You're drunk. And then you join all your friends in the afterlife because you were alive on the chip pile the whole time, and time is irrelevant. And that's the plot of loss. Do you ever wonder why everyone on TV looks so good when everything's going to shit? Like... Milla jovovich.

[ Indistinct conversation ] I don't know, Sean. I don't see nothing. She was here. The chink was in my car. Sean, this don't feel right. I think we just need to just get out of here. I left them. They... they couldn't... Got to get the dog out. Sean, get in the car. Get the dog. [ Receiver taps ] Hey. Did you see something? Is there someone here? What's wrong? [ Receiver taps ] Okay, basically there are no working phones in the southwest. [ Receiver clicks ] Come on. I don't really like it out here. Let's just go inside, okay? Okay? [ Wind howling ] [ Leaves rustling ] Let's go. [ Plastic bag rustling ] Let's just say for a second that there is a god. Why would he hate fags? I mean, why would he hate anyone? I thought that was the point of having a devil. I just don't get it. Did I ever tell you about that friend of mine when I was little... what was her name? Lisa something or other. She was super-religious. I didn't realize it at the time, but her parents used to take me to sunday school and mass every sunday when we were playing, and years later I get this Christmas card, and I swear to god the only three words they used in the entire card were "Jesus," "savior," and "amen." How do you make a sentence with those three words? How do you send a card to somebody... Come with me to Austin. What? I am. No, uh... Stay with me... In Austin to live. [ Laughs ] Yeah, right. Harriet... Look, it's safer there, and you've always said you wanted to get out of L.A. You know, Austin could be a fresh start. I don't know, Harriet. Okay. I bet Austin has a great art scene, and it's smaller, so it would be easier to break your way into. And, uh, you always say that you've slept with everyone in Los Angeles, so it'd be a whole new population. That was a joke. Los Angeles... Is a wasteland. There's nothing there anymore. Oh, it's not fair to say that there's nothing there. No, reba, what I'm trying to tell you is that... Shh. What? It's them! Who? The hipsters! Get down! We have to hide! Where?! We're in the middle of the road! Oh. Wait, I have an idea. Man, this chick has a ton of books. Books are no longer useful except as fire fuel. That's ridiculous. Yeah, it really is, man. [ Books thud and rattle ] God. Oh, I think that I have the runs again. [ Book thuds ] Just 'cause there's a nuclear war doesn't mean we can't read. And... we won't. I mean, what's the point? I'm sorry. What's the point... of reading? [ Chuckles ] I don't know, man. How about education or entertainment or just trying to expand your world view a little bit? How about that? You're never gonna make it. [ Groans lightly ] [ Belt buckle rattles ] What if Mexico's just as fucked? As long as they didn't detonate nuclear weapons against their own people. You don't know that's what happened. It's so obvious. What about al-qaeda? [ Mockingly ] What about al-qaeda? What kind of fucking moron are you? Okay. What terrorist organization could detonate four bombs within the u.S. At the exact same time? Huh, moron? What government could do that without US finding out about it right away with four cities that happen to have key military bases right by, huh? Just shut up, all right? You sound like a crazy person. Right, man. I don't know! Oh! Ugh! Hey! Shut him up! Stop it! Ugh! [ Groans ] Aah! [ Muffled groans ] What was that? I don't know. He's been a fucking baby ever since I tased him. You know what, man? He's sick. Okay? And I'm not feeling great myself. Ugh! Didn't any of your crazy comic books teach you how to do this stuff? I got US this far, didn't I? I'll get US out. Yeah, you did. Good for you. You know, you're not actually looking 100%, either. Starting to feel a little sweat? It's Texas, dickhead. Sweating's a recreational sport. Huh. That's cute. You should put that on a bumper sticker. [ Retching ] [ Breathing heavily ] Hi. Remember me? Yeah. You haven't seen my friend, have you? The blond one... Steve... Alex? Eh, it doesn't matter. His name's Steve. I-I misplaced him. No. But I lost my friend, too. [ Sighs ] And now I'm just out here all by myself... All alone, just little old me. Okay. Come on. You don't really think i'm stupid enough to fall for that, do you? [ Laughs ] Ugh! Aah! Jesus Christ! What the hell is wrong with... [ Suitcase thuds ] [ Breathes heavily ] Is he dead? Hey, kit? Oh, wait, um, wait. Can you just wait? Sorry. I know the bombs are making things weird, and I'm still trying to figure out what to do about that. This is gonna sound crazy, but I feel like you might be the person who could hear it, so... Here goes. [ Chuckles ] Um... You know, if I was being honest with myself, I don't have a lot going right now. I mean, I'm not a loser, but, uh... I'm sort of just nothing... Sort of a walking example of unfulfilled potential. [ Chuckles ] So, anyway, I applied to grad school and didn't get in. But regardless, i'm... i'm going, and it's the first time in my life that... I haven't just fallen into whatever's easiest. And for better or for worse, I'm dragging my friend along with me, and... and that may not mean anything to you, but it means the world to me, and... That car right there, that's my stuff. And... Could I just have it back, please? I always wanted to do something like that. I think that staying motivated is more important than ever now, and, uh... and I guess things kind of gotten out of hand. Yeah, and, you know, it's no big deal. You know, I always like to say that you're exactly where... Gotcha! [ Muffled ] Oh. Took you long enough. How about we find that friend of yours and have ourselves a little fun? [ Engine accelerates ] Oh! Harriet, get in the car! Go, reba, go! [ Body thuds ] Aah! [ Engine accelerating ] [ Crying ] Why did I do that? Why? Hey, just calm down, okay? It's okay. It's gonna be okay. Oh, my god. My mom... [ Gasping ] What am I gonna tell my mom? How am I gonna tell her what I did? What am I gonna...? Hey, hey. It's okay, all right? [ Crying continues ] It's okay. Let's get back to Austin. We'll just make everything right, okay? Okay. It's gonna be okay. Okay. [ Crying lightly ] [ Engine turns over ] [ Radio static ] Stay indoors. Fires raging throughout Houston and surrounding areas.

Everyone went for the water. I mean, there's, like, no water left anywhere, and you know that disaster preparation kit that I have? It lasted one day because I only had five gallons in it, and that lasts one day, and that's it. We ran out of water, and so I thought, "what are we gonna do? We're gonna drink beer." Aren't I smart? Aren't I so smart? You're smart. What are you talking about? I mean, they said like 250,000. But, baby, that's Houston. I know! [ Crying ] Those poor fucking people... Dying from all the radiation.

Okay, Amanda, stop. She doesn't know about the bombs, okay? Just stop talking. It is not for you to tell, okay?! Will someone please just tell me what the fuck is going on?

[ Breathes heavily ] What, you didn't think I knew? You thought it was a lie that you could keep from me? They said I didn't get in this semester, but they said that if I reapplied... Amanda, did you know that your sister applied to a make-believe grad school from a mental institution where she hung out for the last couple of months after she tried to kill herself? What? Harriet, I didn't... You couldn't even get that right.

[ Chuckles ] This more than any other moment is the most important time to not act without information, to attack without certain knowledge. Are you crazy? We have been summarily attacked by the enemy, millions are dead, many more will die in the next days, weeks, months. We are at war. What's your answer? Bomb the world until there's nothing left? They're scared of terrorists. They're stopping everyone and rounding them up. And I quote the prophet forest.

The governor has declared martial law until further notice, and all residents are required to stay indoors. Police and national guardsmen will be visiting homes in the ensuing hours to ensure the safety of Austin's citizens. Please make sure you are home. Anyone found outdoors will be detained immediately by uniformed police or a military officer.
