A professional hunter? She was just like you. Your little sister, Satoko, was just as obstinate as you. After the attack, she would have been so humiliated. But that's no reason to die. Who did it to her? It could have been American GI's, or punks from the local gangs. But you know that. Any clues? Nothing. A hell of a town. Just like always. What can you do? It feeds off the US airbase, it breeds crime. It feeds me, too. Where are you going? Hey, Taro. You cleaned it up. Does it still run? Marlboro, please. Here. Give it back. Thank you. Now beat it. Thanks for earlier. No need for that. Why are you so silent? Would it hurt you to be more sociable? I wonder? I've never met anyone like you before. I'm not used to talking. I'm from a world of ice and snow. Ice and snow? Alaska. Chasing game through the wilds. You're a hunter? Tell me more about yourself. I study the migrations of moose and other animals. I cull the herds to keep numbers down. I'm out there, all alone, for weeks at a time. How interesting. But don't you get lonely? I enjoy it. I don't have to put up with people. Are you putting up with me? I'm on my own, too. I ran away from home. Father wants me to many a man I don't love. So I left. Shall we dance? Sony, no. I don't dance. I prefer to drink. Is the manager here? Yes, this way. I told you the end of the month. Too soon? No, but we just took a big delivery. Anyway, I'll take a look. Have we ever sold you fake booze before? Of course not. No, it's good. Thirty six bottles. So many? Alright, but can you come down on the price? You listen to me. You make a fortune on the booze we get for you. So pay our price. Pay them. Next delivery will be some fine brandy. Let's go. Why? Let's just go. What's going on? Be quiet, or you're a dead man. That's my wallet. What will you do? That's up to them. Hey, baby. Are you gonna put out for us? Get in the car. Follow me! You bastard! I was so scared. I'll take you home. Where do you live? I haven't got a place. So what will you do? Haven't thought about it. I'll tell you now. You ran away from home, that's not my concem. But I don't want to get involved. That's fine with me. Do what you want. Iwill. This is my uncle's place, not mine. I can't just let you stay here. Don't wony about me. Tetsuya, who's the girl? She's a runaway. A runaway? You can't let her stay out there all night. Invite her in. Leave her, she'll go away. Tetsuya, that girl's driven off. Poor girl must have been lonely out there. I hope she's gone home. She's a rich kid out for kicks, that's all. I bet her husband is away fighting in Vietnam. Hey Granddad, fix the headlight. Be quick about it, Granddad. I thought it was you. It's me, alright. Tetsuya! Line up over there. Granddad, will you let him get away with this? We'll take your toy off you. Don't do it, Tetsuya. Get out, all of you. Beat it. Wait! I can't let him get away with that. Don't you get it? He's a professional rifleman. Now we know where he is, we can come back anytime. Where are you going, Tetsuya? After that girl. She'll be back home by now. They're like animals, don't provoke them any more. Tim, no! Who made you do this? Where's the girl? I didn't do anything, I just drove the car. It's them, isn't it? What will you do with her? If you try to rape me, I'll bit my tongue and kill myself. Wait up. She'd do it. Let her. I've never seen anyone do that. She's too classy to let her die. She's more useful to us alive. No, wait. I have money. Isn't that what you want? Tell me more. My father's rich, he'll pay a ransom. He'd pay you anything to save me. Who's your father? A politician. Gohei Yamamuro. You must have heard of him? She's telling the truth. This sounds very interesting. This is their hideaway. You go back. Don't ever tell anyone about this. Go take a look. Don't move. This is no ordinary rifle. Give me the girl. What now? Go on, shoot. But the girl dies. We'd better get going. Thank you, sir. Good bye, sir. A telephone call. Who from? He didn't give a name. Something about your daughter, he said. Congressman Yamamuro. If you want her back alive, prepare ten million yen. Every penny, or she dies. I'll call back in an hour. Who is this? Hey! Call the police. Just call them! I'm so sony, this is all my fault. Damn it. The rope': wet, I can't untie it. Don't shoot. You don't know that gun. It'll break your shoulder. Get up! Now strip. Take your clothes off. Everything. It's all ready for you. Will it pass? They'll never suspect. You mustn't let them escape. They preyed on my poor, innocent daughter. Hello, Yamamuro speaking. You gut the money? It's all ready. Fallow these directions. Have you gut the money? Yes, it's here. Jump in the car, get on the expressway. Do it now. Stop at the bus stop. Go down the stairs. Are you alright? Put out an APB on that bike! Car 105, in pursuit through tunnel 3, heading west. We can't get through. Show me your hands. Palms flat on the floor. Mari! Bring the girl. This is what your father paid for you. You're only worth 100,000 yen. I'll talk to him. Too late for that. Bl... Do it! You, too. C'mon, do her. No, please don't! That locket... ...I gave that to my little sister. We got this locket... ...from that girl at the garage. So, she was his sister? That's coincidence, ain't it? I hate my father. Look what he did to me. I just wanted my own life. I didn't want to be belong to anyone. It can't get any worse... ...it can't get worse than this. You should have kept a tighter leash on her. I'm so sony. But I'm afraid Kyoko is too much for me. Too late for that now. We found her car near Jackson Airbase. Does she know anyone in that area? C'mon, gel UP- Someone': coming. Who are you? He was going to shoot you. He's dead now, get rid of the body. Mari, you watch those two. Pick him up! Help! They're getting away! In here. Help me! You stupid bitch. You let them escape! More cops will come. What do we do? We can't sit and wait! What do you say, Sado? I don't care. We'll go to jail. So where do we go? I've got nowhere to go. What about you? Me, too. I've got nowhere to go. We'll hole up here. There's nowhere to run anyway. Right? Tetsuya, don't do anything stupid. They killed Satoko. But you should leave it to the police. I'll do a better job than them. Don't do it. How many times must I tell you? They're not human, they're animals. Listen, Uncle. I hunt wild beasts. Will you go back to the hideout? To avenge your sister? I wish I could fight back like you. You're not like me. We're from different worlds. We live different lives. Then what should I do? You're tired. Stop thinking, get some rest. How can I sleep? Forget that. Forget everything. Please. Make love to me. Make love to me, make me forget everything. I'll go with you. You stay here. Let's get out of here. Don't go outside. Hey! Come on! Shut up! You ever get that? The feeling this has happened before? Mv bike! Move! If we go out now, that's exactly what he wants! Don't. It's all over. I'll go back to my father. I want to fight like you. THE END
