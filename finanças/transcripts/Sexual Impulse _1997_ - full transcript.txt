(snaps) - [Person In Background] God, ow! (panting) - [Warren] Morning, Boss. - Back at ya, laddie. Ah, Grace, my love, I don't know how you do it. You get more beautiful every day. - Don't give me any of that Irish charm, Joseph Flanagan. I'm getting older every day and you know it. - Ah, the older the fiddle, the sweeter the tune. - Second law of thermodynamics, Flanagan, everything disintegrates in time, including this club of yours. - Now, lassie, we've pulled through worst times than this. Quite seems like only yesterday an angel of a girl walked through these very doors and helped to make the Bull Moose Club this city's finest private men's club. - Yeah, now, it's the only one left, and I'm getting too old to help you save it. You and your boys are on your own this time, Flanagan. - Oh, not to worry. I'll bet there's plenty of new applicants waiting to join the club, right, Warren, me boy? - Sure, boss. There's one waiting for you over there right now. - Maybe we are in trouble after all. Oh, Ms. Powers our new, lady, district attorney. Did the world suddenly run out of criminals, lassie, that you're trying to run the last private men's club out of town. - Flanagan, just open up your sexist club to women and I won't have to close you down. Bull Moose Club is a men's club, (sighs) and it'll stay that way (phone clacks) until the day I die. (phone clacks) (ominous music) ♪ That's what it's like (indistinct) ♪ (indistinct singing) - Mornin'. - You'll get a kick out of this. I was just talking to Dan here about my new recipe for lobster Thermidor. - Thermometer? - Get this. Instead of using dry white wine, I use red Madeira. - What's the matter with you boys? Be men for God's sakes. Whistle at women. Drink whisky. Kill a grizzly. Do something. Do you think the likes of Teddy, Hemingway, and the Duke gathered here to discuss recipes? (upbeat music) (giggling) (siren wailing) (squeals) - The keys, the keys! (keys jingling) (beeps) - I really have to go. - So you gonna call me? - Sure, what's your name again? - I'll write it down for you. - So how'd you do at the races? - (sighs) All right. Had a filly show on the 13th. - I thought they only ran 12 races in a day. - They do. - Fillies these days don't run like they used to. - Boy, you got that right. Joe, let me buy you a beer. - Why does it always cost me money when you buy me a beer? - Set us up, Warren. Hey, Joe, tell us about the time again when you and Hemingway got drunk in... - It was Madrid, and we fought fascists by days and laid whores by night, discussed the meaning of life and got drunk in between. Those were good days, sonny. (indistinct rasping) - Yeah, days of wine and roses before all this political correctness stuff. To the good old days. - To the man's world, when men were men and women were damn glad of it. - Nobody move or you're dead! - Just hand over the cash and jewelry and nobody gets hurt. (indistinct shouting) Shut up, stupid! Here, geek, fill up the bag. - [Lou] Yeah, yeah, sure. - You, too, old man. Open the register. - No, you'll not be getting my money, ya hooligans. - Joe, they've got guns. Give 'em the money; it's not worth it! - You wanna be a dead hero there, gramps? - No, just a man. - Oh, Johnny, you forgot your racing form with my number on it? (screams) - Nice catch, Mr. White. (whimpering) - Thank you Mr. Black. (chair screeches) - (laughs) Uh-uh, uh-huh. - [Mr. White] You like this, huh, bitch? - Johnny, help me! - Come on, come on! - All right, sonny, you made your point. - Let's, go, let's go! - Don't do anything- - [Mr. Black] Come on, move it! - I'll give you the money. - Johnny! (laughs) Johnny! - Mr. White, I believe it's time to go. - Come on, sweet pea. You're coming with us. (suspenseful music) (guns firing) (thuds) - That's should teach those ruffians. A man does what a man has to do. - Joseph, you're shot! - It's only a scratch, lassie. It takes avoid than that to bring down a bull moose. (thuds) - Quick, call an ambulance, Danny! (clattering) Oh my god! Danny, hurry up! Hang on, Joe, help is on the way. You're gonna be okay. - Oh my god, it's in his heart! He's dying! - Joe, Joe, why? It wasn't worth it. - I had no choice. I'm a man. - What? What do you mean you had no choice? - A man does what a man has to do. (groans) It's the way. The tao. Now, it's up to you. - [Warren] I don't understand. What do you mean? What's up to me? Joe! - [Joe] Become men for God's sakes. I'm coming, lassie. (upbeat, ethereal music) (wildlife chirping) (melancholic organ music) (weeping) - [Warren] He was the light and inspiration of my life. - [Grace] He was the last and best of a dying generation. - [Joe] Sex is the last vestige of manhood most of you still have left. Lose that and all is lost. In the great sex wars of this decade, the Bull Moose Club is your last resort. Keep it if you can. See you boys on the other side if you can make it. Signed Joseph P. Flanagan. - [Dave] Man, did Flanagan throw some funeral. - Yeah, best one I've ever been to. - [Dave] Yeah. - Joseph P. Flanagan. I'd like you all to drink toast to the memory of the late, great Joseph P. Flanagan. (exhales heavily) (indistinct chanting) There's just one more thing now. Surely, you know he wouldn't want to worry anyone while he was alive. There's a $50,000 note that's due on the mortgage next month. (sighs) So I suppose you could say the club is, well, it's ours to lose. (crickets chirping) (dramatic music) (water bubbling and splashing) (sensual music) (moaning) (birds chirping) (chattering) (tapping) - Okay, okay, let's get this meeting going. Where is everybody? - Most of the men apparently were scared off by that newspaper article. - Newspaper article? What newspaper article? - Read all about it. (whacks) - Yeah, those newspaper babes really did a number on us. - Yeah. - Listen to this. And I quote, "For too many years, it's been a reactionary blight on this community that has poisoned the minds of all too many men." - Don't you guys get it? There's a sex war going on and you're the enemy. Either stand up and fight or just whine and wimp away. - Hold on, that's why we're calling this meeting. Joe wanted me to revive his vision, but I don't see how. Press is against us, the DA is out to nail us, and we haven't got the money to make the balloon payment on the mortgage next month. I just don't see how we're gonna do it. We're barely paying our bills as it is. - Hey, let's take up a collection. - Anybody got $50,000? $40,000? 20,000, 10,000? How 'bout 10 bucks? - Hey, put me in for 10. - Great. - Maybe we should just sell the place and take the money and run. - Hey, that's not a bad idea. (clangs) - That's it! I've had enough! Joseph was right. You're not men! - Wait a minute, we're doing our best. There's a lot to consider here. - Consider this. I quit. I will not stand here and watch everything Joseph worked his whole life for be taken and destroyed! - Grace, we need you. - First, Joseph gets himself killed, and now, you're killing his legacy. Maybe in my next life. - Grace? (chiming) Grace! - Okay, we hold off selling the place until I can figure out what to do. We open tomorrow as usual. Meeting's over. - Well, that's it. The fat lady has sung. - Well, we're down the tubes now. What a pity, the whole thing. - Okay, boss, what do you want me to do? - I don't know. We go on down the road as usual, I guess. Run an ad for a new barmaid, will ya? - You got it. - [Protestors] Bull, bull, the bull must go! Bull, bull, the bull must go! Bull, bull, the bull must go! - I don't believe this. - [Johnny] Me neither, man. Check out the tits on the brunette. - [Protestors] Bull, bull, the bull must go! - What? - The bull must go! - You guys just stick around. This is gonna be a great story. Okay, girls, you're doing a really good job out here. I want you to hold down the fort 'cause I'm going in. We're gonna close down this sexist club. (cheering) - I don't know, Johnny, what're we gonna do? - Hi, I'd like to apply for the barperson position. - It's barmaid, and we don't want your kind around here, babe, so take a hike. - Babe? Think again. Here's my resume, and you'll see I am the best and only applicant for this job. And if I don't get it, I'll see you in court, 'cause it's called job discrimination, babe. - Let me see the resume. - [Protestors] Bull, bull, the bull must go! Bull, bull, the bull must go! - Look, sisters, what we have here is one of the last few pockets of male resistance missed by our frontal assault on men over the last few decades. Remember back in the sixties when we burned our bras to make men think that women's liberation was really sexual liberation, you know, free love and all that? Well, in case you haven't noticed, I'm not wearing a bra (chuckles). - You mean it's a trick? - You got it, honey. Men are always suckers for sex. And I'm kind of the rear guard doing a little mopping up operation. And frankly, if you don't get outta here quick, you're gonna blow my cover, right? So scoot, okay, thank you. - Well, under the circumstances, we'll certainly consider you. - If the job wasn't already taken that is. How could you forget? - Well, I- - I'm so sorry, you know how men are. They're always forgetting our anniversaries, birthdays, even hiring us it seems, just like little boys. Aren't they cute? Oh, I'm sorry, I hope you weren't put out too much. Don't be a stranger now. Please, come again. (pops) - Yeah, I really appreciate your help, but who are you? - I'm Kali, your new barmaid, silly. - Yeah, of course, she's our new barmaid. - But how? I mean, who, did you... - (laughing) Really, is life worth so many questions? Why don't you boys just sit back and relax and let me get you a beer. After all, that's why I'm here, right, hm? (paper crumpling) (gentle jazz music) (hair dryer whistling) (gentle jazz music continues) - Honey, I... - Hi. - Just what the hell's going on here? - Bad timing. Warren, Bob. Bob, Warren. - Bad timing? - Nice to meet you. - You're doing this worm because of bad timing? - Yes, as usual, you came too damn early. - Too early? I don't believe this. I live here. - Early, late, who keeps track anymore? You're always with your loser Bullwinkle friends anyway. - [Bob] Look, you two should be alone at a- - Yeah, well, maybe I'd be around more often if I didn't have to take a number to sleep with you. - [Bob] time like this. - At least Bob is here for me, which is a lot more than I can say for you. - Yeah. - Get outta here! - So how many has it been anyway? - What do you want, a list? (gentle music) - Hi, boys. What can I do for you? - Yeah, what do you have for a broken heart? His wife just left him or something. - Oh, is that all? - Isn't that enough? - Oh, now, now, now, now, now, big boys don't cry. Women come and women go. That's the way things are meant to be. Here, let me show you. - Now, I'm here. (chiming) Now, I'm gone. Easy come. Easy go. - [Johnny] What was that all about? - I don't know, but I think I like it. - Look at this. Does anybody know how to play this thing, hm? - Yeah, yeah, I do. I once played for the shire. It was right after the coup. It was a little melancholy, so I... Hey, what do you want me to play? - Anything you want, just play something. - Okay. (chuckles) (gentle piano music) - Hey, baby, that's pretty good.

The piano, I didn't realize it was so dusty. - Oh, gee, let me help you out here. I'm really sorry about that. I didn't mean to get it into the... - I don't think it's gonna come out. - I've got some old barmaid's clothes here. Belt, apron, dress. Maybe they'll fit. - Thanks. I'm sure they will. What's the matter? Don't you like what we saw? - See what? - No! Well, I mean, yeah. I mean, it's not that. It's... That's a great fit. That's a good fit. - Thanks. - You know, I have to hand it to you. You really impressed the boys tonight. - Yeah? - Yeah. - What about you? - Yeah (laughs). Me, too. Me, too. - Good, there's hope after all. - Yeah. Well, it's been a long time since we've really had some fun around here. Thanks. - It's a good beginning. You boys have potential. - What do you mean? - You know. - You're an enigma. You know that. - Life is full of little mysteries, my dear. (upbeat music) Well, here's our new waitresses, Annie and Bettie. - Oh, really? Just what may your qualifications be, ladies? - I was a double major in college. - I hope we're not overqualified for this job. - You're hired, the four, the two, you know. (laughing) - Okay, ladies, let's get to work. (chattering) - (drowned out) Education. Makes it a little bit harder for you to understand (drowned out). (chattering) (indistinct) Be careful there. You know how bad his breath is. You never know where his hands have been. (laughing) - Well, what do you think? - It's got potential. Yes, indeed, it's got potential. - I love it when a plan starts to come together. - What plan might that be? - (chuckles) You know. You know. (balls clattering) - So there a modeling convention in town? - No, we're waitresses. - Waitresses? - Why, you two oughta be stars! You know, I know Spielberg. - Steven? - No, Joe, but he's a nice guy. Come on, let's go! - All right (giggles). - Yeah, all right! - I don't like this. They look too happy. - Disgusting. We should bust that guy for sexual harassment right now. - Well, hold on. Let's take our time and bust all of 'em. - Yeah, cut 'em off at the balls. - Yeah, come on in. Hey, I wanna fix you a drink, okay (laughs)? - No, we're gonna do you, Lou. - Huh? (sighs) - You stand back in the back. (clatters) (upbeat music) - [Lou] Yeah, baby. Yes. Oh, boy. Whoo, yeah! Oh, yes! (moans and laughs) (drowned out by music) Wow! (crickets chirping) (ominous music) (whacks) - McClurry, shouldn't we do something to help him? - And ruin the fun? (groaning) (whacking) (coughs) - You're wearing me out, Johnnyboy. - (panting) Why don't you trade places with me? I'll take over. (laughs) - I like that, a sense of humor. - You like that, Kimo? - Let me take over, Stan. It's my turn. - You'll get your turn! Listen here, Johnnyboy, it don't pay not to pay your gambling debts. You know what I mean? - Yeah, Mr. De Angelo's really steamed with you. - Tell him the check's in the mail. - Oh, really? Hey, Stan- - Shut up, Kimo! - Listen here, Johnnyboy! You wanna keep this pretty boy face of yours? We want our 20Gs, (slams) and we want it now. (slams) Talk is cheap, baby. Kimo, beat it outta him. (laughs) (indistinct) Him good. (whacks) (groans) - What did I do, what did I do? (clattering) - Get Johnny, you idiot! - Damn! - Well, things are really coming together. - Yeah. (chiming) - Hey, let me walk you home. - What? I won't hurt anyone. (door creaking) (whirring) So what are you, a bookworm now? - Oh, yeah. I mean, no. No, this is just a book that Kali, I mean, Grace left behind. It's kind of interesting actually. - Hm, good book? - [Warren] Yeah, it's a good book. - Here, I found this tacked on the door when I came in. (chuckles) - [Warren] Call an emergency meeting. So it's official. We have 10 days to pay the 50,000-dollar note or lose the club. We've gotta fight this thing like you would any war. And in war, you damn the torpedoes, charge full steam ahead, and take no prisoners. - I'll drink to that. - Yeah, well, we're surrounded on three sides, and there's only one way out, Colonel Custer. - Oh, look, look, that's the wrong attitude. We can't stop now. Look how far we've come in just the last couple of weeks. I mean, we've just taken in five new members. Now, if we just keep that up- - And we'll have $50,000 in new membership fees in just four and a half months. - Oh, well, are you sure? - Yep. - Nail the lid shut. - Yeah, the fat lady has sung again. - But we don't know what it is that she sang. - Aren't you boys overlooking the obvious? - Yeah, yeah, we're just overlooking the obvious. Which is? - Elementary, my dear boys. Give the customer what he wants, and he will beat a path to your door. - Well, they don't want what we have. Well, what can we do? Anyways, it's the nineties, not the forties. I say take the money and run. - Well, what do men want, pray tell? - (groans) Sex for Christ's sake, sex! Men want sex. They always have and, hopefully, always will. - I get it? We get 'em laid if they join the club. - See, you're not as far gone as I thought you were. - Yeah, it's kind of like an incentive program, I guess. - Are you proposing that we procure sex as an inducement to join the club? (giggling) Never! - (sighs) When are you men gonna learn? Men pay for sex one way or another anyway. Whether it's dinner and the movies or a home and half your salary, payment is made. So what is wrong with giving the customer what he wants when he wants it and at a fair price? - Hell, I would've paid double that money for those two chicks I had last night. - Did you pay for sex? I don't believe this! - You know, for a smart guy, you don't know much. I mean, how the hell else you're gonna get 'em to put out? - Lou's right. - That's right. - Gentlemen, I'd say we have a plan. All those in favor, say aye. - [Patrons] Aye! - Motioned. (cheering) (upbeat music) - What's that? - It's a party favor. - Huh? I get it. I think I get it. Well, well, ladies, how are you doing here? Everything all right? - Fine, thank you. - Well, they look, you look great, fine, wonderful. I'll just go over here. - Great. - Well, the die is cast, I guess. - I guess. Let's rock and roll.

Sorry. - I say, madam, you're one incredible looking lady. - Really? But I thought I was having a bad hair now. - Au contraire, madam. Your hair invokes visions of unbridled passion and sensuality. - Sensual, me? - I say, could I perchance procure you a drink? - You wanna buy me a drink? - (laughs) But of course (speaking in foreign language). - So how we doing? - Oh, great. We got over 10,000 here. 15,000 in new memberships. Flanagan would be proud. (lighter clicking) - Making a hill, pal. (slaps) (upbeat music) (cheering) (gasping) (light-hearted music) - Oh, wow.

You wanna go with me? - Sure. I mean, no, I can't. Some other time? - Yeah, sure, some other time. - [Cameraman] Hey, Dave, I got the best babe in the house. - See that, oh, boy. And for only $200, she's all yours tonight. - I'm in! - There you go. - I'm gonna rock your socks off. - Ooh, I look forward to that, yeah. - Have fun. - Mn-hm. - Lucky fella (laughs).

What do you want? - Aw, you had your warning, Johnnyboy. Now, you pay the price. - Should I rough him up now, Stan? - Where's your manners, Kimo? First we get the money. Then, we rough him back up. - All right, all right, you made your point, all right? You want money? I got money. (chiming) Here, here's some money. Here. Here. - A day late and a dollar short, Johnnyboy. Kimo, start roughing. (chuckles) (cracks) (groans) (laughing) (whacking) (groaning) (sirens blaring) - What's that? - Jesus, it's the cops! (rustles) You lucked out, JohnnyBoy, but we'll be back. Let's go! (grunts) (upbeat music) (cheering) (disgruntled shouting) - [Cop] You have a right to remain silent. You have a right to an attorney. - I already have an attorney. Danny, Danny! - [Dave] All right (drowned out by shouting). - Watch (drowned out)! - [Dave] I didn't do anything! - [Cop] That's what neanderthals get for exploiting the women of this town. - We didn't exploit 'em. We paid 'em! - Yeah, right. (whacks) - Oh! - Come on, turn around! - Oh, my head! (shouting) - [Cop] Let's keep moving! - [Cop] Come on, buddy, we're going downtown! - [Cop] Come on! What are you, a dead moose? Come on, let's move (indistinct)! (melancholic music) - Damn it! (ominous music) (gasps) - You been holding out on us, Johnnyboy. - Don't you know cigars (coughing) are bad for your health? - Yeah, sure (coughs). Mr. De Angelo don't like it when you boys hold out on us. - This place is great! (screams) (drowned out) Oh! Help me, you idiot! - What about Johnny? - Shoot him! - Eh? (chiming) (indistinct) - Oh, my boss is gonna fire me, and my wife's gonna kill me. I'm dead. - Yeah, grown men acting like adolescents. I told you this would happen. Nobody listens to me. - Don't worry, guys. I'm gonna get you outta here. - [Dave] Well, thanks, Warren. You really screwed us this time. - Look, gentlemen, here's the deal. I can charge you all with pandering, running a house of prostitution, sexual harassment, indecent exposure, lewd and immoral conduct, and operating without a dance license. Add it all up and you're looking at about 20 years. - Oh my god. (drowning each other out) - Or you can walk right now. (keys jingling) Well, it seems Flanagan still has friends in high places. Look, you quit the Bull Moose Club never to return and you walk with a ticket for misdemeanor loud and obnoxious behavior. - Hell, no, we can't quit! Can we? - It wouldn't be right. - (indistinct) I'm not gonna blame you, go on. - Hey, I got a wife and kids at home. I can't go down for this. You guys understand, right? - Yeah (indistinct). - Get outta here. - You got some stuff (indistinct)? - Name? - Warren Gray. - Your hearing's tomorrow afternoon, one o'clock. - Who bailed me out? - Broad outside there. Kali, I knew you! Oh, Judith. Well, how nice to see you. What are you doing here? - Someone had to bail you out. I'm sorry all your little Bullwinkle friends deserted you. - They didn't desert me. They just- - Of course they deserted you. What else are rats going to do on a sinking ship? Look, you've had your fun with your little Bullwinkle friends, but they're all gone now, and it's time for you to come home and grow up. - And what if I don't wanna come home? - (laughs) Where else will you go? Come on. (sensual saxophone music) (bed creaking) (moaning) No. (panting) What are doing? Let me do it. Let me do it. (panting) (moaning) What? What are you doing? Don't stop, come on, Warren! (moaning) - I can't. I can't, that's it. (sighs) - You haven't changed. You came too damn early. (melancholic music) - Damn it, Johnny! (thuds) (moaning) (clatters) - Danny, Danny! (indistinct singing) Danny, wake up! It's Warren. - Come on, we've got a case to win! - A case? Well, I'll settle for a six-pack. - No, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about a law case! - Ooh, lord, love me. I haven't won one of those in a whole year. - Well, it's time you started. (shouts) Come on! - Oh, Warren, I thought they sent you to Devil's Island. - No, no, Danny, come on. - You're here. Let me buy you a drink. We'll drink together (indistinct). - Jesus H. Christ. What do I have to do to get your butts outta my building? - Listen, this is still our building, and if you don't get your outta here right now, I'm gonna kick it out. - Fair warning. You have 48 hours to clear out, or I'm gonna have the cops kick you out. And clean this up a little bit too, will ya? - You're gonna get a little kicking up yourself when you're trying to clean it that way. I couldn't believe- - Come on, he's not worth it. - I couldn't (indistinct). - [Judge] I'll hear the opening statements from the prosecution. - You see before you a man who not only broke the law and exploited the good women of our community, but he did so in a cavalier, sexist, and unrepentant manner. I will prove that the defendant, Warren Gray. (slaps) (thuds) - Warren Gray is an innocent man. - Prosecution can call your first witness. - Tell us in your own words what happened at the Bull Moose Club the night of March 1st. - It was disgusting. You can imagine my shock when I brought my client by to see the property and walked right into the middle of a booming brothel. (gasping) - I suppose that after witnessing this horrible situation, you and your client left right away. - No, we stayed but only to safeguard my investment. - There was women disrobing and being exploited for money. Several men even put their unsolicited hands on my body. I've never been so humiliated in all my life. - Can you tell us what you were doing in this photo, which was taken, of course, at the party in question? - Yes, I'm dancing. (hums triumphantly) - And what is the object that you're waving so furiously over your head, hm? - It's my blouse. It had long sleeves. I was getting hot. I was being exploited, okay? - But weren't you being exploited for sex? - They didn't exploit us. They paid us. - So in your professional opinion, did the defendant sexually harass women at his Bull Moose Club? - Without question. (dramatic music) - We'll recess until tomorrow morning. I'll hear final arguments then. (chiming) - [Warren] You were great today. You were just great, Danny. - Thanks, I just don't know how much longer I can last, eh? - What do you mean? - Danny, look at me, look at me, look. I want you to take a long, hot bath, climb into bed, and get some sleep. (ominous music) - You know what to do. Nail that bastard. - My pleasure. (door clicking) (knocking) Hi. - Hello. - Your friend sent me over to give you a massage. - (sighs) I love you, Warren. I was just running a bath. Why don't you come on in and I'll shut it off? (sensual music) - Good morning to you, laddie. - Well, well, well. Top of the morning to you, and what in the world is this you've brought me? - Some orange juice. - Oh. - Drink it all up. It's good for you. - Doesn't taste right without the vodka. - Drink it all up. - Well, if you say so. - I say so. Mn, that's a good boy. (knocks) - All right, Danny (laughs). Danny, Danny. Wake up, laddie! We got a court date. We've got a club to get back. - That's right! That's right, full speed ahead! We'll send the cavalry in first and (indistinct singing). - Danny? Danny, Danny! Danny, ya promised not another drink! - I didn't have another drink! Or (sighs). - And I suppose this is just orange juice. - I suppose it is. (gentle music) - Oh, Danny. Danny, it's the oldest trick in the book. Sweet dreams, Danny. - [Judge] Is the defense ready? - Your honor, the defense requests a recess. - We're back, Warren! - (indistinct) Buddy. - Take the hill, Warren. - Warren, the results are here. - Come in and sit quietly, or I'll throw the lot of you out. Is the defense ready or not? - Yeah, I guess so. - I'll take that as a yes. I'll hear the prosecution's closing statement. - Your honor, I have shown beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Gray did indeed operate a house of prostitution. Women were bought and paid for like so many chattel. He flaunted our community's standards of decency with blatant sexual harassment of almost every woman who crossed into his sexist, chauvinistic domain. Chauvinism is akin to racism. And by this very nature of activity, he has degraded women in general and of this community into subservient position that the people will not and cannot tolerate. (excited chattering) I demand for the defendant to stand accused on all accounts. - I don't wanna go to jail. Sometimes, I mean, (drums pounding) a man does what a man has to do. We come from a noble heritage where men have gone out into the world seeking its truths, bringing about resolutions, rendering decisions, whether it be in battle to affect social change or to win the hand of (drowned out by music). - Hi, judge. - Men have always paid for sex in one way or another. And today, if a woman is willing to part with that special gift for dinner and a movie, or a home with children, or with cash on the hoof, then I say make your best deal. Give the customer what he wants, and sleep in the bed you make. Just as it's part of man's nature to conquer and give, it's part of women's nature to receive in whatever form it may come. That's the tao. That's the ancient law of yin and yang, an unchanging, immutable truth that no court in this land can legislate away. I say it's okay to be a woman, and I say it's okay to be a man and that the two are separate and distinct beings. And thank God for that distinction! (speaking in foreign language) Yes! (applauding and cheering) (gavel banging) - I've heard enough. I'm ready with my judgment. - Hi, judge. - Oh, what the hell? Case dismissed! (cheering) (upbeat music) (excited shouting) - Remember to be out of my building by midnight tonight. - You may have won the battle, throwbacks, but you lost the war. And I'll make damn sure you are out on the streets by 12:00 sharp. - Come on, boys, we got this. Let's go! (drowned out) - Well, well, what do you know? The mountain comes to Mohammed. - Yeah, I was in the neighborhood. I thought I'd stop by and check on your hand. - Don't worry about my hand, Johnnyboy. I still got two hands here to get even with you. - Can I plug him now, Stan? - I don't have time to play with you boys. I came to get my money. - So what can I do for you, Mr. Cruz? - Your boys took some money that wasn't theirs. I'd like to get it back. - And I'd like to let him have it (laughs). - You're a little mixed up I'm afraid, Mr. Cruz. You see, what my boys took was just what you owed me on your little gambling debt plus the usual late fees. - It wasn't my money they took, but I don't wanna argue with you. I just want another game with you to square things. - What are you gonna use to play with, Tiddlywinks? - No, I thought since my debt was paid off, I could get a little more credit from you. - No money, no game. - I'll back his action. - Kali. - My, my, what's a beautiful girl like you doing with a loser like Johnny here? - It's just a little missionary work. We all do what we can. You understand. (ethereal music) - This should cover it. Well, who am I to stand in the way of a woman on a mission? (light-hearted music) - This one's gonna cost you 10Gs to stay in the game, Johnnyboy. (chips clattering) - No problem, I got you covered on that. - Read 'em and weep, Johnnyboy. (laughing) - Hold it! Straight beats three of a kind in my book. - Huh? Hey, what do you think you're doing there? - Well, you know how time flies when you're having a good time, but we really do have to go. - Yeah. People to see, places to go. - Listen to them, Warren. You're all losers! Now, get the hell out my building. - We stay until midnight. (suspenseful music) (drowned out by music) - Ten, nine, eight, seven- - Hey, we got it! (shouting) (chiming) (thuds) (excited chattering and cheering) - Now, for the last time, take your money and get the hell outta here before I kick you out. (slaps) It's over, man, it's finally over. - Not so fast. Why is everybody always in such a hurry these days? You know, you never told me you were a member of Flanagan's club, Johnnyboy. - Yeah, gee, I guess it just never came up. - You mean, he never told you about the times that we used to get drunk with Hemingway in Madrid? - You're the Marco De Angelo, the one Flanagan always talked about fighting the fascists in Spain with? - Well, you could call it a folly of youth, you know? Fighting fascists by day, laying whores at night, discussing life and- - [Johnny And Marco] Getting drunk in between. (speaking in foreign language) - Hey. I can see you've heard of some of our stories. - (laughs) Yeah, just a few times. - You know, after the war, Flanagan went his way and I went mine. He became a real man. I became a rich man. He was my best friend. Hell, he was probably my only friend. I loved that man. Helen, what are you and McClurry doing here? I thought I told you to keep out of the Bull Moose club. - Nobody told me anything, except McClurry said that someone from high up was trying to protect the club. McClurry, why didn't you tell me it was Mr. De Angelo? - I didn't think it was that important. - I'll show you how important I am when I have your badge, McClurry. Get him the hell outta here! His type don't belong in these hallowed halls. - Yes sir, Mr. De Angelo. Sorry for the little mix up. - Rally up to the bar, boys. (upbeat saxophone music) The drinks are on me. - All right! - Ladies and gentlemen, here's to the Bull Moose Club and (drowned out by music) once again. (cheering) - (drowned out) To real men.
