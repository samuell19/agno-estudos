[Instrumental music] [Music continues] [Music continues] [Music continues] [Instrumental music] [Plane buzzing] [Music continues] Tarzan! [Instrumental music] And he is on his way. Yes, highness. Go to the monastery and tell sechung to prepare my successor for his journey. My brother... is your health improved today? Look upon me as one who hears death breathing in his ear. Then I must speak now before your successor comes. I consider him an unwise choice. You stand alone against the other members of the council. The council of elders are losing their wits through age. Their choice has been made.. And you will not oppose it. Leave me now. You are my brother and leader. I obey. [Instrumental music] I am the spiritual sovereign of this land.. And yet, I cannot warm my own brother's soul to me. [Dramatic music] [Indistinct chatter] [Elephant trumpeting] Nari! Nari, now, come on. Move. Now, come on. Move. [Chattering continues] [Horses galloping] [Gunshot] [Speaking in foreign language] [Indistinct chatter] [Horse neighs] Stand up, my friend. Tell me, who's bringing the successor to tarim? I said, who is bringing the successor to tarim? Take his robe. Give him sword and cesta. Arm him. I hear you are a fine swordsman. I would like to test myself against you. [Elephant trumpeting] [Elephant trumpeting] [Indistinct chatter] Nari! Come closer. You will learn something. [Horse neighs] [Dramatic music] [Grunts] [Grunts] [Indistinct chatter] [Music continues] [Grunts] [Grunts] Who is bringing tarim's successor? Tell me his name. - Tarzan. - Again. A man from Africa. His name is Tarzan. You fought well. [Screaming] What is it, nari? He told you what you wanted. So why did you have Tor kill him? He was a strong and clever man. Suppose he'd escaped? One must always secure one's position, nari. Remember that. My son shall rule this land after me and no stranger from Africa can turn the course of our destiny. [Instrumental music] [Music continues] [Whistling] [Whistling continues] [Boat revving] [Speaking in foreign language] [Dramatic music] [Grunts] [Boat revving] [Screams] [Engine revving] Tor! Tor! [Instrumental music] [Roaring] (Tarzan) You're a fool to run into the jungle. You should have stayed on the riverbank. I was trying to get help. Why were those men trying to kill us? Oh, pirates, that's all I know. And I tried to warn you on the boat. You had never seen any of them before? Oh, never. And who are you? Called Tarzan. Oh, Tarzan, I have heard of you before. What are you doing in this country? There's a monastery, north of here in the foothills of the mountain. Oh, yes, I know it. An elder with the name of sechung, he lives there? Yes, sechung lives there. My guide was killed. Well, let me guide you then, instead. I'll be honored. - What's your name? - Hani. Over those hills. [Grunting] [Screams] [Grunting] [Indistinct chatter] [Elephant trumpets] More! Eat more. Food is very good. You do not eat. I'm not very hungry, thank you. The monastery is a day's walk from here. In the foothills of the great mountains. My guide knows the way. You are welcome to stay with us tonight. Thank you. [Indistinct chatter] My people are praying for the soul of our leader, tarim. He's still ill? We hope for his recovery. But the successor has already been chosen. Yes, but where is he? No one knows. No one knows when he will appear. While our people are waiting.. Poised like an eagle, is tarim's brother. - Tarim's brother? - Gishi Khan. May he be taken early and suffer long. Do you think it was Khan's men that attacked us? I don't know. Their faces were hidden from me. Khan has always been jealous of his brother. Where there is jealousy, there is darkness. Excuse me. I must join my people in the temple. We will leave within the hour. [Indistinct chatter] (Gishi) You swore to me the man from Africa was dead, Tor. And at this very moment, he is on his way to sechung's monastery. Forgiveness, Khan. - Another chance? - No. You leave Tarzan to me. You will kill the successor. Get out! The successor is the chosen one. He must not be touched. Chosen by whom, nari? By old monks who know nothing of the real world? Outside these mountains, men with modern ways and weapons are moving towards us. Civilization is coming. How do we meet it? They need a new kind of leader. One who will teach them these modern ways and make them strong. I would have been that man.. But they chose my brother tarim before me. The chosen one is holy. Not until tarim dies, when he is holy.. Then he will have my respect. But not now. Not now. [Bell tolling] [Instrumental music] Two strangers. Meet them. Bring them to me. [Music continues] (Sechung) Have you no proof, no evidence we can see? Nothing to convince us that you're the man tarim chose? I told you, we were attacked. My friend, the messenger that your tarim sent, was killed. How do we know that? Because I tell you. And he can tell you. Why should his word be taken? He is not known to us. Our tarim knew that a man of unusual bravery and strength must be found to take his successor to the city. For he feared the harm his brother gishi Khan might do him. Since no one in this land could stand up to Khan in strength and cleverness, it was necessary to go elsewhere for such a man. He heard of Tarzan from one of his monks and Tarzan was sent for. Now you say you are this exceptional man but there is no proof! [People clamoring] Proof! No proof! Wait. Listen. Listen to me! Do we need more proof to that which our eyes see that which our ears hear? I believe him. The monk that told your tarim about me was a man that I met in Africa. We became very close friends. He contacted me and asked me to do him a favor. He said it was very important to him... and to his people. I agreed to do it. And what was this great favor? He only told me that I was to escort someone through very dangerous country. After I arrived, before he could give me the details, he was dead. Now, you'll have to find somebody else. (Boy ♪1) Let him be tested in our skills! His actions will be the proof we need. Will you agree to the tests? Who are you? I am the successor. You're the successor? I'm honored. Do you agree to the tests? What are they? Tests of strength and wisdom. I agree. [Indistinct chatter] Prepare! Shoot! [Applauding] You have shown your skill. Next comes our test of strength. You will be required to resist the pull of two buffaloes for five strokes of the gong. [Strikes gong] [Mooing] [Buffalo moos] [Groaning] [Groaning] [Groans] [Buffalo moos] [Groans] [Instrumental music] [Cheering] [Grunts] You are strong, but are you wise? For a strength without wisdom, often breaks its own back. [Sighs] I hope I'm wise enough to learn. A good answer. But now, answer this. On meeting an enemy after a 1000-mile journey of what would you make sure? After meeting an enemy? Thousand miles journey? L... I'd make sure that journey was his. [Instrumental music] We are honored to have you serve our next spiritual leader kashi. The woman who watches over him is called Cho San. - Are the tests over? - We accept you. You are kind to come so far to help me. Come. We must prepare ourselves. [Music continues] What will happen to kashi when he reaches the city? He will undergo final tests before the people and when he succeeds in them.. They will know he is truly the chosen one. What if he doesn't succeed? Then Khan will take the throne by force and a 1000 years of peace will be ended. What is wrong, Cho San? Why do you ask, kashi? You seem so unhappy. Are you afraid? No, not afraid. It's just that I do not wish to lose you. How can you lose me? When a boy grows.. And changes into a man no matter if he stays with his mother or not in some way she loses him. You are not my mother. But I feel as a mother does. I'll go and see if we have forgotten anything. (Sechung) The east road leads to the city. A difficult way, but the shortest. Mang will go with you and all the men you wish. I'd be very pleased to have mang. Thank you. And one more, my guide hani. So few? Our safety lies in speed. We're here. This is the route you must take. (Tarzan) Why? (Sechung) Because it leads to the shrine where kashi will make his final vows. - Does this have to be? - It is imperative. Does Khan know about this? Only the elders of this monastery and myself and of course, mang. Alright, we leave tomorrow at sunrise. One last thing.. All Khan's men wear one of these. Take warning by it. [Birds chirping] [Instrumental music] [Monkey hooting] [Elephants trumpet] [Dramatic music] [Music continues] [Instrumental music] [Horses galloping] What brings you here, gishi Khan? Bad news. Tarim is dying. We know that. What journey are you beginning? A religious one. I thought I might find tarim's successor. I wish to pay my respects. Tarim's successor is not with us. Perhaps he's gone ahead? There are rumors a man from Africa is giving him safe conduct. In this country, there are many rumors like bees stirred from a hive. Let us pass, gishi Khan. Before you go, do you know my son? Look at him well. He looks a fine boy. He reads, he writes, he knows the ways of the elders. He also is courageous. Are those the qualities you look for in a leader? A man may have 1,000 qualities.. But he cannot become our leader unless chosen by the council of elders. Can he not make himself a leader? If one of his qualities be humility he will not force his destiny. [Dramatic music] [Instrumental music] We'll rest here. Why? Are you tired? No, I was thinking of you and Cho San. Oh! We will tell you when. No, kashi. I'll tell you when. Now. - Hani! - Yes, Tarzan. We're stopping here. I want you to ride to the shrine make sure there's no one in it or near it. And get back just as soon as you can. Uh-huh. Thank you. Better sit down, kashi.. And rest. I prefer to stand. It's been a long ride. You know, my back is sore too. Is it? Mine is not. Oh, there's nothing wrong in admitting it. You know, this is the very first time you've ever been on a horse. You see? No pain. [Groans] [Horse neighing] Why do you want him to admit he's hurting? It's human. Is it? It is not our way. You could not understand. There is no point in discussing it. Discussing? I thought we were arguing. [Strikes matchstick] Ho! [Dramatic music] Halt! Through there! [Music continues] [Horse neighing] What's that smoke? I don't know. [Horse neighs] We'll go along the side of the gorge and pass further down. What are you waiting for? The shrine.. What about it? I must make my vows there. Can't you see the fire? It hasn't reached the shrine. Bring him along. Come on, what are you waiting for? Didn't you hear me? If I do not make my vows.. There is no point in going to the city. If you go to the shrine and the wind changes, what then? That is not your decision. If you do not take us, we must cross alone. Why are you listening to this child? Khan will see that fire. Until a thing happens, let no man say it is so. We'll leave the horses on this side. [Dramatic music] Let us leave this place! The boy must finish his prayer. [Instrumental music] [Fire crackling] Tarzan, let's leave! Please! [Dramatic music] [Music continues] Oh! [Growling] You can't go through that fire! - It's the only way! - Yes, there is a way! This way! Come back here, hani. Take the boy. Here! Straight ahead! Hani! [Dramatic music] [Roars] [Elephants trumpeting] [Music continues] Hani! Hani! [Growling] Hani! Hani! [Screaming] No! [Screams] [Dramatic music] [Fire crackling] [Music continues] Do you think the chosen one has been killed? You are the chosen one! I have chosen you, do you hear? [Kookaburra cawing] Mang? Let's see the map, please. You know these caves? Yes, about two miles from here. I want you to take kashi and Cho San, and go on. What you are going to do? Wait for Khan. Go on ahead, I'll meet you there. Now, hurry! [Instrumental music] [Monkey shrieking] [Music continues] Hill tribes. In here, quickly! [Buffalo moos] [Music continues] [Elephants trumpeting] [Shrieking] Where's kashi? Kashi? Kashi! - Kashi! - Kashi! [Instrumental music] Kashi! [Music continues] Kashi, come on, now. Kashi, what are you doing? Be careful, the mother will be near. Il don't think he has a mother. We must go, kashi. Can't we take him with us? That is not possible. Come. I shall think of a name for you. Come on! [Instrumental music] [Instrumental music] [Elephant trumpeting] [Elephant trumpeting] [Instrumental music] Kashi, come back. Kashi! Come! Kashi, there's no time. Oh, just one minute, please. I knew I'd see you again. Kashi! Come quickly! I'm gonna call you hungry. Come on, kashi, quickly now. Come on, come on now. [Instrumental music] [Music continues] [Elephant trumpeting] [Instrumental music] [Monkey chattering] Shh! Keep it quiet. [Monkeys screeching] [Birds chirping] [Monkeys screeching] This way! [Instrumental music] [Elephant trumpeting] [Instrumental music] [Music continues] [Dramatic music] [Gun cocks] Where is the boy? [Gunshot] Where is he? Watch them. [Instrumental music] [Birds chirping] Kashi? Kashi! [Gunshots] [Dramatic music] Boy! Boy! [Music continues] [Music continues] [Gunshot] 5 (tor) Oy! Boy! Come out now or your friends will be killed. Kashi! Don't listen to him! Stay where you are! [Gunshot] 5 (tor) Oy! Boy! [Intense music] Let me help him. He'll die unless I bandage him. Let him die. Why do you want to kill the chosen one? (Male ♪1) Khan will be our ruler and his son after him. (Cho San) Tarim is ill, do you not understand? The boy is the successor. Would you kill the sacred one? (Male ♪1) Tarim lives, the boy is nothing. While tarim lives, he is not sacred. [Grunting] [Gasps] Where's kashi? In there. [Echoing] Kashi! [Echoing] Kashi! Here I am, Tarzan, over.. [Muffled screaming] [Echoing] Kashi! [Kashi grunting] Cho San! [Gunshot] Take the boy down the hill. I'll bring mang. Go on. [Mang grunting] [Instrumental music] There's a village near here. We'll get help for you there. City, only a few hours.. That wound is too dangerous. The city I promised you.. I mean nothing. [Instrumental music] Kashi must be there on time. I am sorry, mang. There's no need. [Instrumental music] [Music continues] [Trumpeting] [Instrumental music] Why are we stopping? You're bleeding too much. It's too far, mang. Now, let me help you down. No. No, we're not too far. This is a bad place to stop, you know that. Don't underestimate Khan. Never. Before long you may have to undergo another test. A far greater one. Please... please, go on. [Dramatic music] [Instrumental music] [Music continues] [Instrumental music] Cho San.. You have helped teach kashi to be brave. Now teach him humbleness. For pride is the evil shadow of greatness. Yes, mang. [Instrumental music] Don't be afraid to cry, kashi. Please, stay with us, mang. No. I must go ahead. I think we were... Brothers once. For we've begun to be brothers again. Promise me, when I die.. Not to cremate me, but bury me. It's too... dangerous here. My soul will.. Will.. [Gasps] We will bury him now. [Gong strikes] Why is the village deserted? What has happened here? [Gunshot] [Horses neighing] Is there a plague on your village? Where are your people? My people are going to the city to welcome the newly chosen one. He is holy now. Tarim is dead. He is at peace. I think I envy him. That man in the cave, I've killed him. You did it defending the life of the chosen one. Would it have been a greater sin to let him die? There is no time when killing is right. You killed one man, Cho San. May be by so doing, you saved the lives of many. Perhaps.. [Horses neighing] You are not afraid. That is good. I come in peace. Tarim is dead. You know you must pass certain tests before the people will accept you. I know. And even then. But let us leave that until the day. Nari! My son. You have sent your men to kill us, Khan. Nari and these men will escort you to the city. I must ride ahead and take my page with the council. You go with the boy, African? I'll stay with him until he's ordained. [Instrumental music] [Music continues] [Music continues] Sechung. We have been here a day praying for your safe coming. Cho San, Tarzan.. And mang? I'm sorry. Tomorrow at noon you take the tests. I have been asked to direct them. Tonight, the people pay their final tributes to tarim. [Instrumental music] [Instrumental music] [Music continues] For over 2,000 years our leaders have departed this way. [Music continues] But your people.. They don't seem to be sad. Why should there be sadness? Tarim has been released from the wheel of life into everlasting contentment. [Music continues] All night and tomorrow until it is time for the tests the people will show their happiness. [Music continues] [Crowd chattering] [Drums beating] [Instrumental music] How long they're gonna keep kashi in there? Until the test begin. He will contemplate, and cleanse his mind and heart, so he will be ready. Do you feel uneasy here? - Here? - In our city. In any city. [Drums beating] [Trumpets blowing] [Instrumental music] You have been chosen as tarim's successor. Is it your wish to take these final tests before the people to show your faith and true right? It is my wish. There are three white diamonds in front of you. One of them belonged to the first tarim and it has been handed down to all his spiritual sons. If you are the true successor, you will know which one it is. [Instrumental music] [Crowd chattering] I ask you now.. Two of the goblets are full of water and one is empty. It contains the great emptiness which is the aim of all wisdom. Choose it. [Instrumental music] [Crowd cheering] The final test is called for. Four of the urns are empty. One contains the ashes of our first great tarim. Choose it. [Instrumental music] [Music continues] [Music continues] [Instrumental music] [Crowd cheering] It is done. They accept him. We call you tarim. We acknowledge your divine right to rule us. Are there any among our people who would challenge this? (Gishi) I challenge! [Crowd chattering] I challenge. On what ground? I invoke the challenge of the fourth test. The challenge of might? Of might. But this challenge has not been invoked for 1,000 years. We're people of peace. We have no need... This is a new time! The new world is coming through these mountains toward us. We must prepare to meet it. I challenge the new tarim to show that he can defend us and that he can also defend himself! [Crowd chattering] Are you aware of what this will mean? I am aware. [Crowd chattering] The new tarim calls up an ancient law permitting him to name a defender in his place. He has asked the Tarzan. The man from Africa to be his defender. The rule of the new tarim has been challenged. You have been asked to defend him. Challenger... defender. One to live, and one to die. Do you accept the challenge? I accept! [Crowd cheering] Why did you challenge him? - What is it, nari? - The people want him. But they will have me. And after me, you. No, father. I could not be a leader. I am too afraid. Afraid? I've given you courage and taught you strength. Why should you be afraid? I have always been afraid of you. Of me? I've shown you nothing but love. I made the challenge for you. You are afraid of the sin of pride so you say you do it for me, but it is for yourself. Go on, nari, you're making me angry. - You must listen... - Get out of here! Young people have difficult days. One must forgive them. One must forgive them, do you hear me? Get out! Get out, all of you! This... temper of mine. This temper has always been the same. I'll kill the man from Africa first. And then I'll study to lose this temper of mine. [Hungry trumpets] So you see, hungry, if Tarzan doesn't win tomorrow I'll never see you again. [Hungry trumpets] I think he will too but I feel afraid just the same. And I don't want him to be hurt for my sake. I had to choose him though. He is the only one who could stand up to Khan. And don't worry. Cho San will see that you are fed properly. Goodnight, hungry. [Bell tolling] [Monks chanting] [Dramatic music] [Trumpets blowing] [Crowd chattering] [Water bubbling] [Dramatic music] [Music continues] [Instrumental music] [Crowd chattering] Challenger, defender.. "You will be taken outside the city "passing the course which leads back to us. "You will see on the way "where the knife is to free you from each other. "At no time will one strike the other by hand or by weapon.” This rule must not be broken until you reach your final goal.. This net. The lines of life and death. A web in which there are no rules. If the choice of the new tarim be true life to him and his defender. If the choice be false.. Death. These swords, preserved 1,000 years await challenger and defender. Take them as you reach the net. Challenger to kill. Defender... to protect. Are you ready? [Trumpet blowing] [Horse neighing] [Instrumental music] You know the course. Dismount. Your final goal is the net, and the new tarim. [Both grunting] [Dramatic music] [Music continues] [Gishi grunting] [Tarzan groans] [Instrumental music] Why did you accept the challenge, African? Why did you make the challenge? It's my country, I know what is best for it. Kashi is best for it! You'll never see Africa again! Growing weak, defender? [Instrumental music] [Intense music] [Instrumental music] [Dramatic music] [Music continues] [Instrumental music] [Both grunting] [Dramatic music] [Crowd chattering] [Instrumental music] [Music continues] [Crowd cheering] [Panting] [Crowd cheering] [Instrumental music] [Crowd cheering] [Music continues] [Crowd chattering] [Water bubbling] [Crowd cheering] [Crowd cheering] [Instrumental music] [Water bubbling] [Water bubbling] [Crowd cheering] [Dramatic music] [Crowd cheering] [Dramatic music] [Both grunting] [Grunts] [Crowd cheering] [Gishi gasping] [Gishi screaming] [Crowd cheering] [Cheering continues] [Cheering continues] Destroy the net! We will not use such things again. [Crowd cheering] [Instrumental music] We'll say goodbye here. Must you go, Tarzan? Yes, I must, kashi. But you are welcome to stay here to be my defender as long as you wish. You don't need me any longer. Your people will defend you now. I will miss you. I will miss you too, kashi. You have done so much for us, Tarzan but what have we given you? The greatest gift of all.. Friendship. Goodbye. [Instrumental music] [Music continues] [Hungry trumpets] [Instrumental music]
