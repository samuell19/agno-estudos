I'm sorry but he isn't available. - Can I take a message? - Oh, no, that's okay, maybe you can help me. I was talking to Rob about an employee working with you guys. Blonde hair, pretty, late 205... I have completely forgotten her name, do you-- Hello? They put you up here? Yeah, I've had better jobs. Lightbulbs. Thanks. Can I open a window? Smells like piss in here. How are things? As good as they can be. Spoken to Rachel? No. Still won't talk to me. Just give her some time. She'll come out of it soon enough. I don't think this is something you can come out of. We both know she's stubborn. She'll come around. Yeah, maybe. You wearing that chain? Yep. It was a Christening gift. Oh, yeah. Who gave it to him? Can't remember. Rachel might know. So who are you spying on? A woman. Is she pretty at least? It's only for a few days. You don't think it's a little too soon for you? It's just a few days. I'm fine. So you're free for Thursday? - Thursday? - My birthday. Will Rachel be there? I don't know. But you should come anyway. Yeah, I'll try my best. Oh. I'm sorry man. Yeah, no. It's fine, Dan. You should appeal it. - No, I'm good. - You have to appeal them. It's so much money. You'll spend forever paying it back. It's fine. Really. You need to pull hard. Thanks so much man, what do I owe you? Don't worry, I'll see you Thursday. - Drinks on you. - Sure. See you. B-U-C-H-A-N-A-N. Yeah, okay. Got it. See what you can dig up on him. - Mainly on his father, George Buchanan. - Yeah, sure. I'll be here for another day but see what you can get on him. What address am I delivering to? 128 Overlook Street. - Talk soon. Bye. - Bye. Parker. I wanna speak to the client. The client doesn't wanna be contacted. But this is bullshit. What do I-- what do I do if he hits her again? You're here to watch her. Just watch. No, but then you tell me, what am I supposed to do if he harms her? It'll be fine. Don't worry. That's not your problem. We'll take care of it. ls there anything else to report? She hasn't left the apartment once, still haven't got sound in there. Oh, and I looked into her work at Cathgate Research Center. Couldn't find anything. - You tapped her phone line? - Yeah. She mentioned a guy on the phone when she called in sick, a Dr. Bret Buchanan. Heard the surname, looked them up. What did you find? Well, I did a general background check. Turns out he's being groomed for politics, but dropped out and studied physics in England. What else? Um, he's the son of this George Buchanan. Wealthy family. Father ran for Governor about 20 years ago. There was a big scandal. Not much else. What do you know about this scandal? Press dragged up something about an old mistress who disappeared. Then he dropped out. That's all I got. Just focus on the girl. That's not what we're after. Okay. How are you for supplies? - Good. - Sure? Yeah, a friend dropped over some food, I'll be good until tomorrow. What friend? It's my brother-in-law. We can trust him. Well, no one else. Yeah. Okay, no one else. I'll call tomorrow before you finish up. Sure. Ya, asshole. She hasn't left the house in 49 hours. Ah... I also believe that Dr. Buchanan is fianc√© to our subject one. Okay. I know that she also works at the Cathgate Research Center. Is-- so, is that all you needed to know? No. We think there might be a few more days required. What? Just a few more days. Yeah, well. Get someone else. It's easy money. Look, I don't care. I've spoken to the client and they're willing to pay extra. 10,000 for the rest of the week. Okay, 15 for the rest of the week. Okay, so what is it you want me to do? Same thing? Yes. Just watching and reporting-- Look, I am happy to report back to you but I need to know if this is gonna get worse. Is there something I should be looking out for? Just watch and report back. That simple. Yeah, sure. - Thanks, Parker. - Yeah, talk tomorrow. Where were you? Sorry, just been busy with work and my paper. You sound tired. lam tired. So tired. How long have you got left? - End of the year. - Oh, that's pretty close. Well, it feels like forever, like I just give it my all and never get anywhere. It's not true. How's Bret and things? - He's fine. Just the usual. - Usual? Never mind. How are things with you? Yeah, as good as ever. Thinking we're gonna have to move soon though. How come? Oh, a lot of things. Mainly rent, I guess. We just got a letter telling us it's going up 15 percent. I told them to look for new tenants, it's just ridiculous. What are you gonna do? I mean, are there cheaper places in your area? Not really, I'm thinking we might go back with Mom. Well, what about the kids and school? I don't know. Jeez. Here's me complaining about my problem. Oh, don't be stupid. We'll be fine. I know you will. Hey, let me know if there's anything I can do. Oh, thanks, hon. Anyway, better get back to it. Stanley's parent's are coming over tonight. They're not so bad. They're assholes, but I can deal with it. I hope you feel better soon, though. Me too. I think I'm gonna take a long hot shower. That sounds good. - Bye. - See ya. Hello? Oh, hey. Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. No, no, don't worry about it. Yeah, um... Yeah...

So, give me a call. We'll-- Hey. Did you find anything? Yeah, yeah. I found out a few things. The wealthy family, started out in oil, moved to media. For the past four or five decades, they seem to keep to themselves, you know? Anything on Bret? Oh, nothing that you haven't already covered. Ah, I have found something, though, that might interest you though. Yeah, that's George Buchanan's missing college girlfriend. The thing is she wasn't missing. She was found on the family estate. They were away at the time and she was there alone. Parker. Who's this guy? That was the groundskeeper, he strangled her and then he committed suicide in prison. Hey, look, this is really explicit stuff for this kinda job. There's some really weird shit in there, you know? - You know what I'm saying? - This is off the record anyway. You just keep it to yourself. Don't just spread it around. Understand? You should leave. What? You don't understand. It's an offering. Parker. Yeah. He told me I should leave. He spoke to you?

What are you doing? Parker. I don't know. Parker. I don't know. You have to get the end that's not the head. It won't break through. Hold it firm. It's too wet. Get another one. You have to... thread it through the sliced end. Got right through. Got right through. And then... Yeah, stick the head on the spike and it won't slide off. We had a prolapse. We had a prolapse. It's my anus. I need your help. I have no one. How are you feeling about being a dad? I don't know. How do you feel about being an uncle? I don't know if I'm ready for it. It's all just... you know it's-- I think you should get an abortion. What's wrong with your face? Charlie? Roll it on the rock to dry it out, you can get it on the hook easier that way. You know it's the girl. They want her. They came to my house. They cut me. Hello? I'm leaving. Are you okay? I'm sorry, but I'm leaving. If you leave your contract is voided. Stay and it'll be fine. Stop saying, "it'll be fine." Everything's not fine. Something's wrong What are you thinking, Parker? I'm thinking this job's not what you're saying it is. I think you've been lying to me. Yeah? Who is this? No, you don't know me. No. No, I know what this is. It won't stop her. We're not part of this. Why does it have to be her? Why does it have to be her? Hey, T. - T... - What are you doing? You're still here. You haven't left yet. I heard you. Were you talking about me? I... Why don't we go now? Together. It was your father wasn't it? You need to leave. Or what? You don't listen, do you? Stop it, Bret. Bret, you're upsetting me. I'm upsetting you? No, you need to leave. - You have to leave. - I'm not leaving! - Will you just-- Will you listen? - Stop it, Bret. Listen to me! Please, no, or I'll call the police. They can't do anything! Get out! Get the fuck out. Listen... Thank you. What was the argument about? Um, he was drunk, he wanted me to leave. Leave here? Yeah, just... Hmm... to go away with him. He'd been acting really weird over the past few days. How do mean, weird? Just asking me to leave my job to move away with him. Move where? He never said. And do you know why he would say that? Can I see him? No. Sorry, you can't. Why? Bret's parents have requested that you not see him. They can't do that. I'm afraid they can. But we were supposed to get married. Yes, but you're not married and you haven't been living together. Come on, fella. Come on, buddy. Come on. But that's ridiculous. Isn't there anything we can do? Can you talk to them, can... Can they call me? Okay, great. Thank you. Yeah. That would be great. Okay, so you'll call me later today? Yep. Okay. Thanks. Thanks for your help. Bye. Hello? "- Hey. Sir. Please.
