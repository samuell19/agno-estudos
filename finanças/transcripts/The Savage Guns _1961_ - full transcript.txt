Nazdar, tati. - Nazdar, Antonio. Antonio! Antonio! Hide, Ortega's men are here! Lupe, Lupe! Miguel, Miguel! Sanchez, a message from Ortega: you don't pay for protection, you don't have one. Bandits, let me go! Miguel! Let me go! Migueli! Migueli! We are going. Migueli! See those horses, aren't they beautiful? Boss, it's settled, no more trouble with him. What about his wife and boyfriend? You didn't do anything to them? No. Okay. You know I have nothing against women and children. You just make widows and orphans. Silence, disappear! Let's go. What is wrong with you... Poor guy. Looks like it went from there, we'll see. Do what are you waiting for? Some sort of desert rat. Don't you have eyes, Danny? Use them. This one knows how to defend himself. Didn't you notice? What's a gunslinger doing here? He must have been hired by some poor farmer. Who would dare..., ...Lopez or the American, Summers? We got a little stiff in our actions, so they called someone. If that gunman is headed for Buena Vista, I'll find out soon enough. What do I want? Let's not waste time, let's go. Good night, Senor Summers. Good night, Paco. Juana, go to the bedroom, it's late. I will stay with Senora Sanchez. Mike, I can't go on like this, not anymore. How could he do that? I have thought about it many times..., ...no matter what happens, I won't use the gun. Selling the ranch then, Mike. You can not be serious? Rather than be owned by Ortega, let him lie in ashes. You are affected by what happened. Dad gave it to us as a wedding present, Mike. Ortega will never own it, I swear. If you don't want to do it you... Who are you? What are you doing here? I need water, food. Can't you hear? I'm talking to you. If you want water, there is plenty outside. Naleju mu ji. - Ne. This is not a hotel. I want to drink, anything. Sit down. You don't seem very hospitable. Vylez! To the table! What is it called here? Údolí Buena Vista, sir, Sonora. I will remember it as a resting place. Thank you senora, I didn't like to bother you. He is sick. I'll bring a blanket. What are you doing? Until we find out why he's carrying a revolver... ...it will be better if we don't take any chances. Ortega would never send such a man. We shouldn't trust him until we know why he's here. I'll take care of his revolver. You certainly regret what happened, and so do we. But you are the mayor and if you used your authority..., ...there wouldn't be a funeral now, tomorrow it could be someone else. I will have all the bandits who killed Sánchez locked up. Haven't you visited Ortega Ranch? - No. Why should I? Because the bandits are there and you know it yourself. Prove it. Evidence is lacking. Won't you stay with us? - You are very kind..., ...but we're going back to the ranch to see if there's anything to sell..., ...and then we head to Veracruz. Thank you very much. We will help you with everything you need. Good day. Good day. Sorry for the inconvenience last night. How do you feel? - Okay. So you're ready to hit the road. But eat breakfast first. I spotted a horse, will you sell me one? My foreman will take care of it. Did he take care of my revolver too? I did that. Would you like to work here? Maybe. Like what? We have enough guys right now. But not revolvers. But mine is not for rent. When you're not looking for work, what are you looking for in Buena Vista? Personal matters. And Ortega too, right? Who is Ortega? A murderer, he had a woman's husband killed..., ...who left a while ago... ...and no one will hold him accountable for it. What about the law? Mayor? You saw, he is incapable of..., ...he might want to follow him, but Ortega is cunning... ...and he won't allow anyone to suspect him of being associated with the murderers. Even if the mayor wanted to, he couldn't do anything at all. There are other means. Guns? It wouldn't be the first time. Ortega is surrounded by gunmen..., ...until we unite to attack, everything is useless. But that is no reason to retreat. This is exactly what I expected from a person like you. Let me tell you something to make it easier for you to understand. I was an officer in the Confederate Army during the war..., ...it was a long and cruel war that destroyed thousands of lives. I have killed many men. I participated in the battle..., ...in which more than 13,000 soldiers of our army fell... ...in less than 24 hours, the enemy suffered the same losses. Regiment after regiment was decimated in one of the most savage... ...and senseless warfare..., ...I myself ordered the battery to fire..., ...when I spotted the fleeing enemies... ...and I saw them torn apart in no time. That afternoon any of the men could have been glad to have died by a bullet..., ...because the surrounding woods were scattered by cannon fire. The wounded were burned alive, and their horrible roar still rings in my ears. The sight of burning bodies is disgusting..., ...but even worse is the smell of burnt human flesh. That's when I swore that if I survived the war..., ...I will never again use a weapon against my opponent. I have kept my promise and will continue to do so. Thank you for your hospitality, I have to go. Just a moment. Wouldn't you like to stay? Why should I do this? Because I think you need to rest… ...and it's better here than in the hotel, isn't it? Yeah, that's true. I like coffee and company, thanks. Just a moment, please. Can i help you? - No, thanks. I have a habit of paying for food. This is not a man's job. Nice place. - Do you like it? If you want to look around, I'll show you around, but later. Good. I'm happy today, boss. Year, Paco, year. I had a fight with my wife in the evening, but we have reconciled again. I was lucky. Yes, Paco, you had. Franchea, that's a pleasant surprise! I have so few guests these days... Forgive me for not accepting you as you deserve..., ...you know I'd love to. Nice to see you, Don Hernán. I have something to eat... ...and a roof over your head. It's enough for me. But you're not happy, are you? Only someone is happy for a short time..., ...I was already happy, I had already chosen my part. Until Ortega stole all your possessions. Happiness never depended on possessions..., ...although the times I mentioned..., ...they ended the day Ortega robbed me of all my possessions. Now Ortega lives in your house and uses your land. I'm still happy compared to others. Sanchez... I heard about his death..., I know I should have gone to the funeral..., but funerals just remind me that I'm old and useless. Besides, there's nothing I can do. People trust you. - No, girl. They will listen to what I tell them, yes..., I even thought of talking them into resistance. But if Ortega opened fire on them, they would run away in fear. I wish I was born a man. - It would be a shame. So you refuse to help me? It is a great responsibility to ask men to die in battle. We have suffered enough. But from the friendship that binds me to your father... and since I can never resist the pleas of a beautiful woman, I will do as you ask. Summon the men to your house, I will speak to them. I knew you would, Don Hernán. Do not rejoice, I believe that the fall of Ortega... it will take more than my words. Why are you so silent? You said two words the whole way. I have nothing to talk about. Do you have a fiance, Juana? I do not have. Why not, such a pretty girl? I haven't found a man who charms me yet. That's a good answer. And you are married? Who would want me? Every other girl. Are you mocking me? Wait for me, come back! I didn't mean to offend you. It does not matter. Where is your home Steve, where does your family live? I don't have anyone. What happened? Tell me about it. Mother died when I was a boy, I always lived only with my father..., they killed him when I was fifteen. He belonged to those men who can stand up for the rights of others. He offered to settle the dispute to a good friend. I wanted to stop him, he never picked up the gun. But when I found him, he was shot all over. He didn't approve of violence and now he was dead. Poor Steve. After three years I found out who murdered him, but he had already forgotten. When I pointed out to him what he had done..., ...laughed at me telling me to go back to school. I gave him ten seconds and pulled. He wanted to defend himself... Did you kill him? So the law is after you. Not as you thought. But you killed him! It was a fight. Word got around that I was fast, that's why the gunslingers were looking for me..., ...and tried to attack for no reason to prove that they are faster. That's why I'm looking for a place..., where I could put away my revolver forever. Steve... Will you help my sister and Mike? But that's... When they couldn't buy me, they used you! Ale Steve... You're wrong, I'm not a gunslinger. So you think I kissed you just for that? So why? Paco, what's the shooter's name? Finally, who is it? Ask him. Pick him up. Enough, please, no more! That's right, he can't take any more blows. Do you want to repeat it? - No, I'll tell you. His name is Fallon, Steve Fallon. Did your boss send for him? No, he said he got lost in the desert. Liars! Give him more! - No! It's true. Really. Steve Fallon... The famous Fallon. I knew it was him as soon as I saw him. Maybe one bullet would be enough for his reputation. Think you can handle a guy like Fallon? Now yes. Take him away. Why are you doing this? Does your life depend on it? Who knows. Senor Fallon, could you teach me how to handle a gun? Would you stand alone against Ortega's men? If necessary... Even if you are a woman, don't think that they will consider you. They shoot at the hand holding the gun. We have to do something now. If you want my advice, go somewhere else..., ...where you and your man can live without violence. May I know, Senor Fallon, why you don't want to help me? To you and the people around you? When the stronger refuse to protect the weaker, who do they turn to? If the weak seek protection, they will never become strong. So you won't do anything for us. I will when you don't need it. Father! Paco, Paco, what happened? Why did they do this to you? Because of Steve. Ortega wanted to know who he was and why he was here. It was Danny who... This is the last one. I'd like something to drink. Won't you come with me? No, I have a few more things to attend to, I'll see you at the ranch. Pedro! Hello, Senor Summers. That's what I needed, thanks. Summers, I was at your house. Unfortunately I wasn't there when Paco couldn't, I had to stand in for him. You should have left the money to the woman..., I don't like to make an unnecessary journey in this heat. You should know that there will be no more money. What? - You heard me right, I won't pay more. My boss won't like that, Mike. Fuck Ortega! Did you hear that, Gonzalez? Yeah, I'll take care of Ortega. Did something slip your nose or are you drunk for being so brave? Did you have to beat Pac up? I think you're out of your mind. You beat up the poor old man. Is that what he said? No, but judging by his appearance..., ...must have encountered a coyote or hyena. Take the revolver, Summers. Before I kill you, I'll give you a chance to defend yourself. I guess I'll let you down, Danny. Raise it! Turn! Unbuckle your seat belt! Slow down or it will be the last time you do this. Raise it! Go ahead. I appreciate that Steve, but I didn't ask for your help. I did it for Pac, not you. I'd like something to drink now. - Pedro! Steve... Are you still mad at me? No, nothing happened. Did you decide to stay here in the end? This is not the place for me. Why not? I like traveling. But sometimes you stop, don't you? Maybe, but not what you think. Steve..., ...I love you. Why did you choose me? You know I'm a gunslinger, we're all the same..., ...we have nowhere to live or die. I know you're different. Don't believe that, you must not give your favor to a person like me. Would it be asking too much to stay by your side forever? I think yes. I'll do it anyway. Paco. Do you wish, senora? Deliver this to the governor immediately. Yes, senora. I'm writing there to send us soldiers, no one needs to know. I'll take that secret to my grave. Who was that? - Paco! Mike! Are you mad at me? Why should I? Because of what happened at Don Hernán's and because of today's meeting. I think it was unnecessary, but I'm not mad at you. We both want the same thing, but we each have different methods. The important thing is to live in peace, to enjoy our happiness. If I knew that we would find him somewhere, as you wish..., ...I would leave tomorrow. But that wouldn't be a solution. This land belongs to us, Mike, as I belong to you. Nothing and no one can separate us from her, she is ours. Hi Manolo, what's up? Don Hernán, this way. Do you know that he is waiting for you in his old palace? Hello, Senor. - Hello, Hernán. This was once the most beautiful house in all of Sonora. He used to be, senor. Now it is old, dilapidated, lost its value. Houses lose power just like men, such is life. When you're young, no one notices... I suppose you didn't call me just to philosophize. No, of course not, I'm no match for you. When I owned this palace, we made a deal. Do you remember? She sounded like you were going to live in a beach house… and you won't poke your nose into my stuff. I have always followed it. - Really? Miss Summers visited you a few days ago. Shortly after, you paid her a visit accompanied by the others. Do you want me to list them? It's not necessary. So you don't deny that you conspired against me. I was just doing my friend a favor. That was stupid, Hernan. Who will prove it to you? Senor, our agreement does not apply to my friends, or their problems or my interest in helping them. I am aware of everything. I know everything that goes on in Buena Vista. Sometimes even before that happens. I have no doubt about it, and since you know everything Hernán, you broke your word. I request that you leave your house and my land immediately tomorrow. I have nowhere to go, I wouldn't know If you meet your friends again and recommend them, to oppose my plans, then maybe I - Listen. When I came to Buena Vista years ago, I was so careless… and I allowed you to appropriate my property without defying you. That was my big mistake that I made. But if you think for a moment that I'm using my influence and I give advice to my friends who are in the same situation.., then you are mistaken, senor. Have a good time. Bye Manolo, thanks. Get out of here! Come back home! Help me, Padre. You must go son and tell them the truth. I assure you I do not know her. They say that Don Hernán was murdered by bandits. If this is the truth, tell it. It already happened when Sánchez died, then Cardenas, the same thing when Don't think I'm afraid of them. It is your duty. I resign, Padre. Tell them I'm no longer mayor let them choose whom they deem suitable. Please, Padre. Tell them to do what they want. Patience, moment. Old age. Mayor, you may come out, there is no danger. Silence! What does that mean? where is the mayor Captain Baez, thank God you came. These men rioted, they wanted to burn my house and lynch me. That's a lie! - Liars! Why? Captain - Let him tell the truth! Don Hernán was killed! - Silence! No, no! - Shut up! Disperse, leave the square. No, no! You have a minute to do it. We will not go! Saber! I will teach you to respect authority! Forward! Thank you Captain, I will mention your merits to the Governor. I didn't come to help you maintain order in this region, the governor sent me, I want to talk to Señor Ortega. Certainly, Captain. may i know why A complaint was filed against him, I came to verify its veracity. Sergeant, rally the men and await my orders. Follow me! How many more dead will it take before you become convinced that this will never end? I'm sorry, Franchea. I can imagine how you feel after the death of Don Hernán, I know it myself. - It's not just because of Don Hernán, do you realize that? It's you, me, all of us! What was the use of the man's death to Ortega? He created a disturbance, trying to let them know that he is ready for them. Soon his men will appear. Do you really think they will come, Steve? Certainly. And what will you do? I have led an adventurous life. Back then I was indifferent to everyone. Now it's something else. You won't leave. Steve Say you won't leave. I still don't know. If you do, take me with you. That would only delay the time before we were both killed. No, if I go, I'll go alone. Señor, you will see that it will be settled now. What do you mean Paco? The governor has sent help, a cavalry is headed for Ortega's ranch. Drive? - How I delivered the letter, I suspected that everything would be resolved. What letter? The one Senor Summers wrote to the governor. As you surely understand, Señor Ortego, this allegation requires investigation. Of course, Captain, do your duty, I insist on it myself. - Do you deny the charges? Yes, and I think the mayor has something to say. - Señor There's been a misunderstanding lately, Captain. Señor Ortega got talking, but only I am responsible for what happened in Buena Vista. You admit that you are incapable of maintaining order. It seems to me that the mayor is the least suitable person to maintain it. - Do not forget, that I represent the government, Señor Ortego. Now that the captain and his men are here, everyone will know that I am handling my office. I came to investigate, nothing more. But you will stay until the situation calms down. No, senor. Just until I finish the message and I will not verify the truth of this statement. I'm not here for anything else. And the governor? Fortunately, I am empowered to check the mail… before it gets to his desk, he's very busy and he doesn't have time to read dubious letters. You can assure me, Señor Ortego, that this accusation is fabricated? You have my word. But when But if there are repeated riots, which I saw today, I will have no other choice, than handling your appeal personally. Thank you, senor. I am sorry for bothering. Captain, what is the officer's pay? Low, senor, very low. This is a small post, Captain. Thank you, senor, you are very generous. Pardon my curiosity, how did Señor Hernán die? Didn't the mayor tell you? He was murdered by bandits. It scares me to think that they might attack again soon. They are already here! How many are there? - Four. Summers, come out! Or should we go get you? Where is Senor Fallon? - I haven't seen him all morning. He left on horseback an hour ago. Mike, you can't go out without a gun. There are four, Franchea, even Fallon wouldn't be sure. Hello, Summers. What do you want here? I know that you are a reasonable person and do not seek disputes, that's why the boss would like you to come with us and signed some papers, nothing more. You know, change of ownership. What if I don't go? Would you shoot an unarmed man? You will see. Dead or alive, I must bring you. Choose yourself. Then you'll have to kill me. As you wish. Calm down, Danny, or you'll have to kill me too. Throw it away! Don't get involved, Fallon. That doesn't concern you. didn't you hear Come on, do it! Go back and tell Ortega that the Summers won't sell neither to him nor to anyone else. If I don't? In that case, you won't be coming back. Jump on the horse! I wouldn't get involved if I were you, Ortega won't like it. Don't worry, Ortega is done. We're leaving! Attention! You didn't give them a chance to defend themselves. Certainly bigger than what they gave Don Hernán and others. So what the hell are you waiting for? So shoot! No, I'll give you a choice, either shoot or run. Seber ten revolver. Danny, when Ortega comes here, don't go with him, okay? Paco, throw those men over their saddles and send the horses away. You killed them in cold blood, Steve. Otherwise, you can't even kill yourself. Get them out of here. So you're running, right? Who says I'm running away? I'm leaving. Everyone can act as they see fit. But first, tell me why Fallon shot the others and let you live? Because he needed a messenger to tell you that you were done. You are ambitious, you want too much. And how much is that? Is there a limit? I set out to do something, and to achieve it, I have to get rid of half of Sonora, you know me. You're not right in the head. Aren't you dying to own land, Danny? I only care about the dirt that will be on my grave. And I don't need it here yet. So go, but I'm telling you, if you're still in Sonora tomorrow, I swear you will regret it. Sure! All on horseback! can't you hear I said everyone on the horse! No, senor, we want more. What more? More money, senor. If we have to fight Fallon This month you get double. If you don't like it, you can drag too! Are you nervous? Always. So why did you stay? I told your wife to help them if needed. I'm waiting to see how she manages to fulfill her promise. Because with these people I go out. Thanks, Paco. All is quiet, Senor Fallon. But it won't be long. Come on. Guys, let's go. Mike, I'm going to try a trick, you probably won't like it. Do what you think Steve, I'm only acting for myself. Correctly. You could have left when Danny arrived with his three partners. Why didn't you take advantage of it? Should I catch the bullet here or somewhere out in the salon? This is where I found my first home since I was 15 years old. What Juana? I think she would follow you anywhere. Sometimes we do what we think is best, even though it's probably not reasonable. Have you always been this reserved? Why did you fight in the war? Because I believed in ideals. I've shot, but I don't like guns or anyone who uses them. It makes sense? Why did you come, Ortega? I'm here to ask you the same one last time. Sell ​​me the ranch. - You know I won't sell. I'll make you back off, Summers, I like this place. It doesn't matter, I won't sell. Now you and your men get off my property. It won't be like this forever, Summers. Fallon won't be around forever. Get off my property! Just a moment. Want to settle it once and for all? Of course. So I'll do it my way. You finally decided to act, Fallon. It is so. Why did you shoot my men? For this very reason. Steve! Manolo! Manolo! Manolo! What the hell do you want? I warned you, Danny. Yes, but somehow I don't remember what the threat sounded like. Now that Fallon is dead, you have the guts to come back. It's true? Yep, one bullet was all it took and the famous shooter is done. Even yourself. They hit you too, huh? How do you like it? Fallon is rotting underground. It is so. Why did you come Danny? I've ridden a lot of land that belongs to you. And I was wondering how Ortega managed to get everything? Skill, luck Not only that, he had people like me around him, fools who risked their necks for him. I dug through my pockets and you know what I found? Fifty dollars. Isn't that funny? You, as the owner of the surrounding land, and my property is a few small. Is that right? - I have to admit, no. I knew you would understand. You can be sure, Danny, I will help you. I'll give you 500 gold dollars. Twice as much. What the hell are you up to? I want everything. - All I have? You are crazy! Absolutely! Do you want to beg me? I'll take it. Why not! All your possessions, land, houses, livestock even the carriage, everything will be mine. You're left alone, Ortega, men have run away from you like rabbits, you only have me. Do you mind? Just so you know, I'll let you walk away with a nice sum of money, too. Everything is mine everything. Easily gained, easily lost. But this time we will do it legally, on paper. You transfer everything to me and now. Where's your ink and pen? Over there on the table. Come on, mayor, move! Why is it taking so long? - I'm sorry, Senor Danny. Plug. Thanks. - Wait. A toast first. For whom this time? - Suggest. Up to you, senor. No, we've already toasted to me at least ten times. Na Ortegu. May hell consume him! Don't speak so ill of the dead. Why not? Okay, I agree with you. He wasn't that bad, he killed Fallon after all. And then he died of his injuries, poor guy. On Ortega, may he rest in peace! I have very interesting plans, you will see. Everyone gets their money. I'm going to build a big salon first then the pretty girls come, the most beautiful ones north of the border. Then Hey Paco, my friend! I invite you for a drink, how about that? No, thank you, Senor Danny, it's too late for me. Paco, we should become friends and forget what was. As you say, senor, I have already forgotten. Come on, just a drink. Sit down, sit down here. That's it. Paco, will you do me a favor? - Sure, senor. Tell your boss I haven't forgotten about him. I had to arrange a lot of things and one day I will visit him and I promise you that we will have fun. Do you think he will go against me, Paco? No way, he's a coward. Señor Summers will marry two guys like you. And Steve Fallon, even though he's injured, will go for four, believe me. Wounded? Who is injured? - Steve Fallon. Ortega killed him. - But no, senor. You're a liar! Say Fallon is dead, do say it! Ortega fired but only wounded him. You'll see I finish it. I will definitely be more successful. No, Senor Danny, don't do that, Fallon is out, he has an injured hand, he will never be able to shoot again. did you hear Gunslinger and can't shoot! Paco, Paco, sit down! Senor Summers! What is it Paco? There was no other way, senor, I didn't want to Don't apologize, I understand. Look disappear! You must still be hiding a gunslinger here, Summers, we have to settle our accounts. I'm not hiding anyone here. I would say yes. That's enough, send him out! Wasn't there enough dead already? Who says I want to kill him? I wouldn't have thought of that. Look disappear! I'm here for the same reason as my former employer. I like this place, Summers, and I'd like to own it. But if you give me Fallon, you might get to keep it. What do you think? I don't use my friends to make deals. No? That's how I deal with the ladies. Ladies, come here. But! As they say, a real gem. Isn't that right, Summers? I'll kill you, Danny! Could you do it? You need a gun for that and you don't carry one, but I'll be sensible, I'll wait here until you get her. I thought you were a principled guy. One that doesn't allow, to take a peek at his wife. What do you say? I'm sick of you, Summers! Get lost before I forget you're unarmed! Are you looking for me, Danny? Aren't we finally done with it? That's exactly what I meant, Fallon. No, please, you can't do that! He can't defend himself, if you want, shoot me, but leave him alone. Go away, Juan! The two of us will talk later. Do not worry. But, but, but. Steve Fallon, the famous shooter. You look funny, too. What are you waiting for? You will do me a favor. Enough time, Fallon. You will beg for your life first. Your ways don't apply to me. Do it! You can then claim that you smacked Steve Fallon. No one will know about my injury. You will get the reputation you always wanted, they'll say you're the best in Sonora, the fastest. You're scared, don't think you're fooling me. Nobody jokes before they die. When I feel fear, my tongue sticks to my palate but not now, this time I want you to pull the trigger. But you don't dare, I'm sure. You are a coward, the biggest of them all! How dare you? - Danny! Vida, brave Summers. Steve! You gave him a chance. No, it wasn't like that. He didn't expect me to shoot. I admit, neither did I, but you finally made up your mind. Has he decided? No, that would presuppose hardness, but he was a weakling, even though he threatened me in all kinds of ways. I think there comes a time in everyone's life, in which an unrecoverable error is committed. Now it happened to me and one day I will be judged for it. It will never change, men will continue to kill each other. And we cannot judge ourselves. As you said, one day we will be judged. Until Take him away and never come back!
