Mr. and Mrs. Gibbs, I think I have someone here you might like to meet. Well, lookie here, Alice. Oh, you must be Becky! Nice to meet you, Mr. and Mrs. Gibbs. Oh, please call us Ted and Alice. And this is Diego, right? That's right. Welcome home, honey. Welcome home. I know what you're thinking. "Who the fuck is this girl? That is not the Becky I remember." But I had to play the part for my new foster parents. Yeah, these two wackjobs. You know, when Alice and I decided we were gonna be foster parents, we knew we had to move to a community with the best of the best in Christ-filled education and around here they're all blue ribbon school districts. Top tier, top of their class, and top notch. Well, I'm not sure what all is planned for tomorrow but I would love to get enrolled ASAP. Absolutely. I planned on taking you there first thing in the morning. Wonderful. Oh, oh, and don't forget about the new principal. - Mr. Serio. - Good guy. We've gone to the same church now for what? Six years! And he has a daughter that's your age, Sarah. She's adorable. She'll probably be in your class. She is in a wheelchair but you'll still like her anyway. Well, will I get to spend time with her in church as well? Perhaps there's like a youth group of some sort. - Oh, Becky. - Wow. I can't tell you how happy it makes me to hear you say that. Well, shall we? Yes, um, it's just... would you mind if we said grace first? -Can you believe it? -She's perfect. And just remember, if you need anything at all, Ted and I are just in the next room. My guardian angels. Goodnight, sweetheart. Goodnight, Mom. Ted! Teddy! Diego, come. It's been two years since four Neo-Nazis invaded my family's lake house and murdered my father. They were looking for some stupid fucking key that they had hidden below the house. Yeah. That stupid fucking key. But then, this happened. Bummer about me ruining their plans. I'm sixteen now. I've run away from three foster homes. I've manipulated, conned, burglarized, anything to keep me off the grid and out of the system. If you ask me, given the circumstances, I think I'm doing just fine. Oh yeah, I fall into my own hole traps sometimes. Nobody's perfect. Eat. Thank you, darlin'. This is Elena Cahn. I've lived with her for the past year. I don't know much about her other than the following: She's old, she hates almost everyone, and she picks up hitchhikers. It's how we met. I fell into one of my hole traps again today. I saw that. I had just woken up, looked out my window just in time to see you vanish. I quite enjoyed the show. You sleep? No. It's the same every night. What about you? Like a baby. Well? I always start. So what's different about today? I am grateful for food. I am grateful for a hot cup of coffee. How come I can't say food but you can say coffee? Food is a human necessity. Coffee is a delicacy. I am grateful that I get paid today. Hmm. I am grateful for the novel I'm reading. What's it called? True Grit. I think you'd like it. I am grateful for Diego. Hm. He's a good boy. One more. Wow me. I am grateful...for... Another day. ...another day. You know, there should really be a rule against you always saying that as your number three. You only have to think of two things if it's always your number three. I get to change the rules. I'm old. Founding Fathers Breakfast with a side of toast. Thanks, sweetheart. Do you see my name tag? -I'm sorry? -My name tag. Does it say "Sweetheart"? No. What does it say? Becky. Yeah, 'cause that's my name. Okay, Jesus. Oh, sweetheart--Becky... I asked for buttered toast. There's butter on the plate. Yeah, but...I like the butter to be melted into the toast the minute it pops out of the toaster. I didn't actually do it. Hello? But I really, really wanted to. Shit. A Jasper Hills man is now facing first degree murder charges. K-I-L-L-E-R. Double E, Double Word, twenty-two. You can tell a lot about a person, playing a game like this. How so? By the words they're able to find within their letters. My brother made every effort to play the most ostentatious of words. He was a real self-righteous jackass. Two Triple Letters, ten points. I didn't know you had a brother. Four brothers, all older. Do you still talk to them? Only one is still alive. The jackass. I'm sorry. You didn't kill 'em. Besides, I've learned that for every person you lose along the way, you gain another. Anew. Ten. Why have you never asked me where I came from? Why have you never told me? Weren't you curious? A kid with no parents showed up wanting to rent a room. You pay your way. You help out around the house. And I'd hardly consider you a child. You are eighteen, right? My mother died when I was nine. My father was a drunk. I left home when I was fifteen. We all come from somewhere. And we all do what we have to... ...in order to survive. How much does that add up to? Fifteen. Ten. Nice try. We go now to a developing story. They call themselves the Noble Men and they may be coming here to Fillmore. Authorities are aware of the risk of violence at this week's-- The world has gone mad. ...increasing the security detail for Senator Anne Hernandez. They say they've been tracking the Noble Men on various online platforms for months now. They have seen a rise in activity and they've noticed a pattern of their appearances within smaller communities. Whether or not the Noble Men decide to make an appearance at the town hall in Fillmore on Wednesday and what that appearance may look like only time will tell. So are you gonna seat us or you just gonna stand there? Yeah, wait, real quick, I got a question. Um, did your mom actually name you that? 'Cause Becky is a stripper name and any chick that gives her daughter a stripper name is a catch. What is it with you and moms? -I got a thing for moms. -No, what he's saying is he'd love to fuck your mom. That is correct, yes, I would love to fuck your mom. Right this way. Not a fan. Come on. I'm just saying it's weird. Okay, I have a bad feeling. I just want to make sure it's just a rally. Sean, can you do me a favor? Just reach into your panties and pull the blood-soaked tampon from your twat. Would you shut the fuck up, dude? Can you? Look, Darryl will tell us what we need to know when we need to know it. Darryl is a username on a message board. You've never met him, none of us have. He's an ex-Navy SEAL. He's one of the fucking Founding Fathers, bro. How do you know he's not an undercover cop? Oh, my God. Seriously, those guys are on the message board all the time, right? Seriously, pull it out. You're gonna get Toxic Shock Syndrome. That's a real killer, you know that, right? Look, guys, I hate Senator Hernandez as much as you guys do, okay? I hate her. But if shit goes south tomorrow, I ain't going to prison like those jackasses last year. Is it weird, hating bitches as much as you do but also being one? He's not wrong. Hey! Hello? Yeah. Could we get some coffee over here, today? Coming right up. Why does everything have to be like that with you? You could just say like, "Excuse me." I fantasize a lot about the things I'd like to do to the people who piss me off. I've always had an active imagination but it's really gone into overdrive these last couple of years. All right, finally. Thank you. Wonderful presentation. -You are doing great. -Thank you. But this one wasn't a fantasy. Oh, shit! - Fuck! - Oh my God. -Are you fucking stupid? -I am so sorry. You stupid fucking bitch! -Let me go get you a towel. -Yeah, you fucking do that. Get the fuck outta here. Burned the shit outta my goddamn crotch. It's okay, it's okay. Get the fuck aw-- -You want us to fan you? -No, no, stop. Would you two shut the fuck up? Shut up! She did that shit on purpose. Who cares, dude? She's just a little girl. I'm surprised she didn't toss it in your face. Oh, what? Well, kill her if you want to, I don't give a shit. Go. Yeah. Bitches like you need to be taught a fuckin' lesson! Shut up! Hey, that's a real good-lookin' pup. Diego, attack! Diego! Good girl. Hi, Becky. You can sit down. I think she broke my nose. You little cunt. You broke my fuckin' nose! What happened? Apparently she broke Anthony's nose. What the fuck happened to we're just ding-dong ditching her? Yeah, we went with Plan B instead. Oh, this is so bad. - This is so, so-- - Shut the fuck up. Now when I'm done with you, you little shit, you're gonna wish your ass was already dead. Hey! Put the gun down. Oh, fuck. Becky, don't move. Yeah, Becky, don't fuckin' move. Don't you speak to her. Hey, lady, listen to me. -Put the gun down. -Put the gun down, dude. What do you want me to do, man? Put the gun down, man. Put the fucking gun down! -Do it! -I'm puttin' down the gun. Okay. It's down. Good. Now get the fuck outta my house. Elena! Diego? Diego? Diego! DJ. Yeah. All right. I want the both of you to listen up. No one speaks a word of this. -You hear me? -Of course, bro. Hey. Do you hear me? She's gonna go to the cops. Who the fuck cares? I care. You fuckin' killed her, man. You shot her in the fuckin' face. If we get caught for this, my life is over and I didn't even fuckin' do anything. I didn't do any-- You fuckin' listen to me, you stupid, weak bitch. If I ever hear you say any of that shit out loud ever again, I will shoot you in the fuckin' face. You got that? She is a stupid-ass little fuckin' twat. You keep your fuckin' mouth shut. And we are outta here after that fuckin' rally tomorrow. You understand? We're gonna be just fine. You better calm the fuck down. He better keep the fuck cool. Not a word. How do you think he's gonna feel when he sees bullets start flying tomorrow? 'Cause I have a feeling he ain't gonna be too chill. Hm? I mean, you invited him. That's all I'm saying. Everyone I've ever loved has been taken from me. Cancer took my mom. Neo-Nazis killed my dad. And now, Elena's gone. I'm grateful for the home that you gave me. The way I saw it, I had two orders of business. I'm grateful for the time that I spent with you. I was gonna find my dog. And I'm grateful for another day. And I was gonna kill the motherfuckers who killed Elena. Back at the diner , the guys had mentioned someone named Darryl. Finding him wasn't difficult. Apparently, there were only two Darryls in this shit town. I started at 2048 Denning Road. This was Darryl #1. Well, hello there, darlin'. I'm looking for Darryl. That would be me. -Your name is Darryl? -That's right. I don't think you're supposed to be doing that. Well, I won't tell if you don't. Darryl #2 lived at 4739 Colony Road. Something told me that this was the Darryl I was looking for. Dear heavenly Father. We come to You with thanks for this meal that You put before us this evening. May it bless our bodies. Lord, we ask that You provide us with ample rest tonight. Call us to serve You, Lord, and we don't take that calling lightly. Lord, we ask You to watch over us tomorrow along with the other Noble Men as we carry out that work that You've called us to the front lines to do as we try to rid the world of this filth that has been thrust upon our great nation by the evils of Satan, his followers, and those on the other side. In Your name, God Almighty, we pray. Amen. -Amen. -Amen. Dig in, boys. I can't remember the last time I had a nice home-cooked meal like this, guys. Seriously. Looks delicious. Thank you, sir. Well, you can, uh, thank Twig here. He's the cook. Yup. Probably the one good thing my mama taught me and my brother. Save for that, she's a useless femoid like the rest of 'em. What the fuck is a femoid? You don't know what a femoid is? Yeah, man, you don't know what a femoid is? Oh, right, like you do? It's like those things from Austin Powers with the gun titties. No, that's a Fembot. -It's the same difference. -No it ain't. All right, Jesus. Fuck me. Darryl, where'd you find these peckerwoods anyway? I didn't. She did. Oh. And who's "she"? Seriously, what the fuck is a femoid? A femoid is a cross-pollenization of the word "female" and "android," and it's the perfect way to describe nearly every woman on God's green earth. Bunch of gynocentric evil lowlife bitches hell-bent on destroying any lesser man that doesn't fulfill their twisted sexual fantasies or their financial fallacies. Damn, son! Let me be your Padawan, man! That shit is what I'm talking about. Legit! You're not hungry there, Sean? What? Your food. You haven't touched it. Is something wrong? No, no, no, my boy's fine. He's just tired from the long drive up here. But he'll snap the fuck out of it. Right, Sean? We don't wanna be rude to our host. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry, sir. Why don't you take your hat off at the dinner table, yeah? Sorry, sir. You boys can take it easy on the "sir" stuff. I'm just a Noble Man, same as you. It's all right, buddy. Why does he have to stay in this thing? Oh yeah, he just hasn't been feeling like himself lately. Got in a fight with another dog who fucked him up pretty good. I just don't want him to get all worked up. Yeah. Or eat us. It's good you're taking care of him. Hey, maybe we can get one of our flags with his face on it and it could say, "Noble Dog." No, wait, even better: "Noble Mutt." Hey, you hear that, boy? You're Noble Mutt. Yeah, that's one lucky dog to have found us. Excuse me. Motion sickness from the ride. You feelin' okay, kid? Yeah, good, I just had to take a piss. Come with me. Yeah, okay. It's just up here on your left. Go in there. You'll have to excuse the mess. As you can imagine, things have been a little hectic around here. Go on, have a seat. So...when did you decide to become a Noble Man? Um, few months back now? I mean, I've always believed in the cause, I just didn't go to my first rally until a few months ago. Wow. I would kill to experience my first rally again. Anthony says that's where you three met. Yeah. There was a march back in our hometown. They, uh pepper-sprayed the shit out of us. Well, it's good that you were there to represent. It's important that we show them our numbers. Have our voices heard, you know? Yeah, for sure. You wanna see something cool? Uh, yep, okay. Thumb drive. Not just any thumb drive. It's the only one of its kind entrusted by our founder to yours truly. This is an air-gapped computer, our little way to tell Uncle Sam to stay the fuck out of our business. The 12 Disciples? Whoa. -Is that... -It's impressive, isn't it? I didn't realize how many of us there were. A lot more than twelve. Yeah. Did you know that I served overseas? Uh, yeah. DJ'd mentioned something about you being an ex-SEAL. Army Ranger, staff sergeant. Did three tours in Iraq. - Wow. - Yeah. Me and my men, we, uh... we were in charge of hunting down some of the real bad guys over there. Well, um... thank you for your service. You know, there was this one night over there. My squad and I were in this town and we were looking for this real piece-of-shit towelhead. This fuckin' guy had killed, like, fifteen of us at this point in the war. We get to his house. He's not there, but, uh, his wife was. So, I put one of my men out on lookout. This sweet kid... We called him Tootsie because he was always having his family ship out those canisters of Tootsie Rolls, right? Anyways, I'm, uh, takin' my time with the wife and all of a sudden, shots ring out. Within seconds, all hell breaks loose. Bullets are just flying in every direction. Tootsie bursts inside. He's bleeding all over the place. Shot once in the shoulder, twice in the legs. Shots weren't fatal but he could hardly walk. Eventually, you know, the three of us, we take cover in this empty house. Now, we don't have a radio. I tell them, I said, "You know, our guys are gonna come look for us." But Tootsie, he, uh... couldn't keep quiet. He's just screaming in pain. Lopez and I-- that's the other guy-- we just kept telling him, "Shut the fuck up," you know? "They're gonna hear you and they'll find us," but he just wouldn't stay calm, so... I took my hands and I put them over his face and I started to squeeze. I couldn't stop. Softer at first, and then, I started to squeeze harder and harder, until... Of course, you know, Lopez never told a soul. He knew that what I did was the best thing for the squad. You see, that's the thing about being part of something bigger than yourself. It's a team effort, and each individual on that team has to do their part or they take the others down with 'em. One weak link and the entire team fails. You're not a weak link, are you? No, sir. You sure about that? Y-yes, sir. And what did I say about you boys calling me "sir"? Sorry. I am proud to be in the brotherhood with you, buddy. Yeah, for sure. I'm just gonna... Hey, Sean, one more thing. Yeah? What happened to you guys last night? I was expecting you around midnight. Everything go okay on the drive? Yeah, we, uh, just had a flat tire, decided to kill some time at a diner. Yeah, I figured it was something like that. Go on, go on. Enjoy yourself. Darryl! What the hell you doin' in there? Yeah, I'm comin'. It was right then and there, scrolling through that never-ending list of pencil-dick motherfuckers, that I realized Elena was right. The world had gone mad. And maybe I couldn't save the world but I could kill some of those shit stains and I could have a whole hell of a lot of fun doin' it. To saving our country and to stopping the treason one vengeful mission at a time. To freedom. -Freedom. -Freedom. Thought she wasn't comin' till tonight. Who the hell is "she"? Who is it? Well, apparently, it's Becky. Went to answer the door but there was nobody there. Just this. Shit. How the fuck did she find us? I'm sorry. You three know something about this? No. Nothing. One of you care to tell me what the fuck it is you're not tellin' me? -Just tell him, you guys. -You shut the fuck up. I think it would be wise if you listened to your friend here. Yeah, what the fuck's goin' on, gents? -All right... -DJ. All right, fine--no, no, it's cool, it's cool man. They're cool, we're gonna just tell him about the dog, yeah? - What about the dog? - We took him, that's it. - You took him. - Yep. Not a big deal. -Yeah, but that's not it. -All right. -Shut the fuck up. -Shut the fuck up! All right, all right, fine. We took him from some stupid-ass little girl. That's what Dickless here wants you to know, okay? What? She was fucking with us at the diner so we followed her and stole her fuckin' dog. Big deal. Is that what you wanted? You happy now? Is there any chance that, that little girl's name is Becky? There once was a little girl who had a little curl right in the middle of her forehead. When she was good, she was very, very good, and when she was bad, she was horrid. I don't know about you guys, but that was fucking hilarious, right? Yo, that girl's got some balls, right? She's messing with us. Tryin' to make us feel inferior. Oh my God, you know what, dude? You need to calm the fuck down. I think we'll survive a scary nursery rhyme. Yeah, this is exactly what she wants, to make us turn against each other. What the hell's the matter with you guys? Come on, she's like, what, twelve? Yeah, the girl definitely still shops at Hot Topic. No, she's a classic Becky. -A classic what? -A Becky. Yeah, we've established that's her name. No--a Becky. Let me guess. A dyed-hair, loose-clothes, at best a 5 on the hotness scale. Oh, for fuck's-- yeah, we get it, man, you 4chan. -Shut the hell up. -No, no, no, you shut the hell up. - Fuck you. - Fuck you! - Fuck you! - Would one of you please just go find the girl and give her back her fuckin' dog?! Yeah, no, no--no problem. I'll do it. Yeah, I-I'll go. Aren't you forgetting something? What am I forgetting? The dog. All right, look, man. When we took the dog from her, she saw our faces, okay? Now, if I just go give him back to her, she's gonna haul ass straight for the cops. That's not really my problem. No, it sure as shit is your problem if you want us at that town hall tomorrow. Look. She's just a stupid kid playing a game of hide-and-seek. All I'm gonna do is just go and find her, get her to calm the fuck down, then I'll give her her fuckin' dog back. Okay? Hey, Becky! You want your dog back? Huh? You come and talk to me. You come and talk to me! Hey. Would you stop? Look, I'm gonna give you your stupid dog back. All right, goddammit, stop, or I'm gonna shoot you right in the fucking head. Thank you. You know, you put me in a pretty tricky situation. Oh yeah, what's that? Well, I'd shoot you, but, well, then they'd hear the gunshots and start asking a lot of dumbass questions. Hm. That would be real annoying. You're right, it would be. So it looks like I'm just gonna have to find a better way to kill you. The fuck?! Your friend probably shouldn't leave keys in his tractor. What the fuck? You better get me the fuck out of here. -You killed my friend. -Yeah, and I'm gonna kill you too if you don't get me the fuck out of here! Then, you took my dog. Your dog is fine! That's what I've been trying to tell you! Okay. I'd shoot you but they'd hear the gunshot. And to be honest, you know, guns kinda bore me. I guess I'll just have to find a better way to kill you. Yeah! That's a Noble song. Whoo! That would blow up on Parler. Christ, man, now what? Don't open the door! What the fuck? Please don't open the door, please! Please! No! No! Darryl, don't open the fucking door! Darryl! What the hell was that? Did his head just explode? Mother of God. Darryl, what are we doin', man? Should we go to the cops? Oh, I don't know, Twig. I got a headless corpse on my doorstep and enough weaponry in my barn to start an insurrection at town hall tomorrow, so perhaps bringing the cops onto the property isn't the best course of action. What do you think, you fucking idiot? Yeah, probably right. You two. -Whoa, whoa, whoa! -Fuck! Talk. -Okay, we killed the lady. -No, no, hey, no. We did not kill anyone. Anthony did. -Who was she? -She was just some old lady. Who was she? I don't know. We don't know. No, no, no, he's telling the truth. Look, Anthony wanted to follow the girl home from the diner and he said that he was just gonna scare her. But then some old lady came out with a gun and so, he fuckin' shot her. And then we took her dog. Dude, dude, dude, that's it, dude, I swear to God, man. I'm supposed to believe that a little girl is doing all of this on her own. Yeah, I don't fuckin' know, man, but we're telling you everything. You should've given her her fuckin' dog back. Wait a minute, did... did you just say "insurrection"? What? You just said that we have enough weaponry in that barn for an insurrection. I knew that there was something you two assholes weren't telling me. Are you fucking kidding me, bro? You said that this was just a rally. No one cares about that. You guys have been lying to me this entire fucking time. What the fuck is your problem, man? Fuck this... Fuck this. I'm out. No, hey--hey, Sean, listen. That little psychopath just blew Anthony's head sky high. She'll kill you. I'm gonna take my chances. Sean. Sean! Hey. Wait, wait. Stay. Stay the night. We'll get through this, together. And you can help us with our calling tomorrow, for the brotherhood. Fuck the brotherhood. And fuck you, you psycho motherf-- Jesus fuck! I asked Anthony to bring me Noble Men. Now, this is not a Noble Man. What about you? Are you a Noble Man? Do you honestly think I would say no to that question right now? Answer the question. Yes. I'm a fucking Noble Man. Good. Move the body. You may want to invest in one of those power washers for the front of your house. Are you having fun? Wicked fun. You? I think that I'm beginning to like you. Too bad the feeling isn't mutual. I'm told that my houseguests upset you last night. Yeah, you could say that. What is she saying? Yeah, what's she saying? I wanted to keep things cordial, give you your dog back, but... you seem to have other plans. I would, uh, love to play with you, really would, but unfortunately, I have more pressing business to attend to. It's not a bad plan, you know, the one you have to attack town hall tomorrow. What the hell's goin' on, Darryl? You're fuckin' with the wrong guy, little girl. I have photo evidence from your little command center. We should really talk about that creepy Senator Hernandez mannequin, BT-dubs. Did you buy that wig, or is it something you enjoy in your downtime? Maybe I should just put a bullet in your dog's skull right now. Do it and I'll send all the photos to the sheriff's office the second I hear a gunshot. Every single one of you fake patriotic fuckers will go down. Yo, could you just tell me if she's coming for me since technically I'm the one who fucked up her dog? Fuck it, I'm gonna end this. Gotta admit, you got me between a rock and a hard place. Oh, good, then I'm doing something right. You know what, fuck your dog. I'm just gonna have to kill you. You could, but then you'd never find where I hid your thumb drive, and I bet a lot of people would love to see that list of douchebags. You're fuckin' dead. Cool, just one more thing real quick, your friend on the dock could use a hand. She's got a crossbow! She's got a fucking crossbow! Get it out, Darryl, get it out! Calm down! All right, hold still. Wait, what are you gonna do? What are you gonna do?! Ah, fuck! Wait, what are you doing? Twig, she has the USB! I'm gonna fuckin' kill you! Eat shit, you little bitch. -She dead yet? -She has the list. -What list? -The fucking list! You can say that as many times as you want, man, I'll still have no fucking idea what you're talking about! No, no, no, hey, no, stop, please. You're gonna stop him from killing that girl, and then you're gonna bring her back to me alive, and if you don't, you will fucking wish she was the one who was slaughtering you! -You get me? -I get you. -You fucking get me?! -I fucking get you! Go! Fuck this shit! Motherfucker. Hey! Stop! Looks like someone's trapped, huh? You're not gettin' out of this barn alive, I'll tell you that. Oh, fuck me. No! No! No! I wish, but I couldn't find the keys to that one. Still, I managed. , I have a kid! I have a kid! A baby boy, and a wife. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I act like I'm a tough guy, but I'm not. I act like I hate women, but I don't. I really don't. I swear, if you let me live, I will never say another horrible thing about women ever, ever again. I'll love my wife with all of me, and I will raise my son to be the best man he can be. Please, I don't want to die. I'll do anything. What's his name? Huh? Your son, what's his name? Fuck. It's Adolf. You gotta be fucking kidding me! No! Good morning. You slept through the night. Has anyone ever told you that you cry out in your sleep? Diego! Try all you want, you're not getting out of those knots. Boy Scout. You seem to have left this in the woods. You came prepared. True Grit. You've got grit. I'll give you that. I also found this. I figured it was nothing, but then... Looks like coordinates. I think I'll keep it. Darryl, you out there talking to yourself or what? I'd introduce you two, but I'm told you already met. Well... hello there, darling. Remember me? You look confused. Is it the name? Now who says only men can name their kids after themselves? I may be the mastermind of the Noble Men, but I could still be woke, no? I hear you've been causing quite the ruckus around here. So, tell me, darling, where is the thumb drive? I don't think you understand the gravity of what it is you're doing right now, but I would urge you to reconsider. You don't seriously think I'll tell you, do you? Your son said it himself. That little piece of plastic is the only one of its kind, which means the only reason I'm still alive is because I know where it is. Well... how about this? If you tell us, there is a small chance I will let you go, but if you don't tell us, there's a far greater chance that I will lose my patience and say, "To hell with it," and let Darryl here have his way with you. So, I'm gonna ask you once again, sugar. Where is the thumb drive? Told you. Well, you weren't kiddin'. I think we might be goin' about this all wrong. Maybe you should join us, honey. Hell, we could use some more of that feisty female energy. I'll pass. Aw, shucks. That's a shame. Get him. You got quite the sweetie pie here, you know that? Yeah, we got to spend some quality time together while you were, uh, sleepin'. I guess the boys were a little bit busy, you know, dealing with you and what all, so by the time I got here this morning, they had forgotten to let the poor thing out. So I took him out to do his business. Didn't I? Yeah. Heel. That's my boy! Yes, that's my boy. Incredible, isn't it? Dogs, fascinating creatures, aren't they? They love their owners, but the one thing that they love more than their moms and pops is food, of course, especially meat. Yeah, and does this boy love meat. Yes, you're my love, yes, you are. You know, I am a dog lover just like you, always have been. In fact, I like animals more than I like humans, and although it's been said that I have kind of a mean streak, when it comes to these little creatures, I don't have a mean bone in my body. Now, Junior, on the other hand, he doesn't mind getting his hands dirty, do you, baby? Stop it! Oh, he doesn't like that. Here you go. There, all better, all better, right? You just made a big fucking mistake! Darling, you are gonna tell me where that thumb drive is, or those mistakes are gonna keep on happening, and they are gonna get bigger and badder until, eventually, there won't be any air left for him to yelp. Okay. Okay what? I'll tell you where it is, but... you have to make me a promise. Put him away. So, name your terms. When I get out of this chair, and I kill you both, promise me you'll go straight to hell. And how do you plan on getting out of that chair? Girl Scout. God damn it. Fuck. Fuck! Stop! I was gonna let my son kill you, but I think I'll do the honors myself. If you kill me, you'll never find the drive. Oh, you're right. Sorry, pooch. No! I'll be back, okay? You can't get hurt, but I will be back. Okay, I'll be back, I promise. It was fun while it lasted. It's not over yet. Well done. Diego! Diego, hi. Hi, hi, come here. Come here, come here. Hi, yes. Hi, hi, come here. I know, I know, I know. Hi, buddy, hi. Well, aren't you two just the cutest? Guess you missed my brain. Guess I didn't. Oh, shit. Diego, attack. No! No! No! You were right. He really does love meat. Hello, Rebecca. I'm Kate Montana of the CIA. Do you know what this is? I might. That's a thumb drive, and it contains the names of the members of one of the most dangerous terrorist organizations in the United States. We've been following them for years. They've expanded through all fifty states, into law enforcement agencies and government agencies, and you, a 16-year-old girl, you singlehandedly took out one of their cells. One of them escaped. DJ Turner. Don't worry, we'll find him. What do you want? Just want to ask you two questions. If you answer yes to the first question, I'll move on to the second question, but if you answer no to the first question, then I will be unable to reveal the second question, I will shake your hand, I will thank you for the service you've performed for your country, the CIA will forget about all this, and you can go back to living your life. So, what do you think? Would you like to hear the first question? That's not the first question. Sure. Rebecca, would you be interested in being the youngest ever recruit for the Central Intelligence Agency? Fine. I'm looking for a yes or no answer. Yes. Good. Then I can move on to question number two. Are you ready to find out what this belongs to? Yes. Now where's my fucking dog? Okay, check engine. Well, there's engine oil, there's oil. Something...
