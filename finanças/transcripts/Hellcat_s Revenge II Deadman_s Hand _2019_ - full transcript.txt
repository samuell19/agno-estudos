Bobby, what's the action? Five to one, and she's the five. Five, one odds. Five red, one blondie. Oh! Oh, that's gotta hurt. Oh, no! These bills are for me, blondie. I'm never betting against you again. You should come around more often. I need to update my ride. Didn't know you were so interested in coming back around, Kat. I have my reasons. Yeah. I bet. Times have changed since you've been around, Kat. Look around. No really, look around. This is all mine now. It's no place for a good girl like you. I'd like to give you 24 to get out of town but, I didn't get where I am by trusting people. And something tells me that you just won't go away. So, sorry it has to go down like this, Kat. What do you want? What you looking for, blondie? 'Cause you know there so much to see around here. So uh, if you find anything let me know, okay? You hear me. Yeah, I'll let you know. So what's your name? Kat. Word is you're in for murder, is that right? Okay, right. Listen, no one's going anywhere around here, so let's be cool, okay? I mean, I don't need enemies. I'm Vegas. People ask me, what's it short for? I say it's short for Vegas. Okay, so I'm a jackass. What are you gonna do? Step on out, lunch time. Hey, wanna do lunch? We're not sitting over there. Let's sit here. Who is that? Val. Bad ass bitch in for murder just like you. Maybe you two will hit it off. Whoa, slow down chief, I said maybe. What are you in for? Dealing drugs. Dealing myself. And beating up my old lover with a crowbar. You ever love anyone, Kat? Yeah. And? I shot him. Cool. So you know how it is? Yeah. Lookin' fit, Kat. Eight, nine, ten. Whoa. You know, you look like a fire. But you better keep it quiet. You know, the girls will challenge you around here. So you're saying you don't want to be tough in here? No, I ain't a fighter. I do yoga and, I'd rather paint your nails, take your drugs, all of them. Heads up, we got company. Sup bitches, you wanna work in with us? Shut up, Vegas. We're hear to talk to the new girl. Lay the ground rules. Get assigned a job here yet, Miss, whatever your name is. 'Cause if so, we get 20%, you get safe. Cat got your tongue. Yeah, they gave me a job. Yeah, what's that? Yard work. You, wait outside. That's quite a first impression in the yard out there, Kat. It's Kat, right? Well honestly, it doesn't matter. You're here off the record. No one knows you're here and no one ever will. So my advice to you is to be cool, make some friends, take up some hobbies, and look forward to our social events. Because let me say, you will look stunning at the prison prom. Or you can be this. And this place kind of has a way of policing itself at times. So either the inmates beat me, or you do. No. No. I don't do any of the beatings, he does. Do you feel any nausea? Dizzyness? Headaches? No. What exactly are you checking for, doc? I'm looking for signs of a concussion. Well, it's kind of my ribs and my lip. Here's a balm. Put it on, it will help expedite the healing process. It'll help the bruises heal faster. And don't fuss with it for several hours. Anything else? Guard, we're done here. My advice to you, leave the balm on and stay out of trouble. Your girl is quite the handful. She's a Hellcat. What plan do you have here for her? I want her alive, just uncomfortable. Break her. That's not going to be easy. Is that a problem? No, no problem. I just wish I had a little more knowledge on this situation. She stays in permanently. I don't want her dead and running the risk of making her some kind of martyr hero for the Hellcats. Or the Vipers for that matter. If they find out she died in prison for a crime she did not commit, I think you know what I'm getting at. Keep her in there. Keep her uncomfortable. Keep everything off the record. That's all the Knowledge you need. Right. Better yet, I'll go talk to her. Sorry. Hi. I'm uh, not completely prepared here. I don't have a file on you, which is odd. But I'm working on that. I'm Philip Boucher. I'm the counselor here at the facility, but you can read that. Um, it's Kat, right? So um, I have a confidentiality agreement with you so, if you need to vent or, I mean basically, whatever you say with me, stays with me. And if you're not comfortable talking to other people you can come to me. I'm here for your emotional support. Also, if you need like a specific job detail, or you know, you want a specific area of employment or whatever, I can uh, I can put in a good word and try and set that up. So, where would you like to begin. I think we're done here. I get it, you're new here. So am I. I get my bachelors in psychology and they send me here. It's not exactly paradise, I know. I realize there's a lot to process here. So, we can check in in a few days and I'll see how you're doing then. In the meantime, if you need anything, I'm here from eight to four, Monday through Friday. Hey chick. Poker game going on in the rec hall at seven, you in? I'll be there. Cool. Ow. Get her up. No no. Liking your new home, Kat? Fuck you. You know Kat, I could kill you any time I want. Any time. The thing I'm struggling with is, do I keep you around for something special, or do I just be done with you? I like my women dangerous, Kat. You know this. You know. But with you, I just can't decide. I asked you something before. What do you want? I already have what I want. Vipers and Hellcats are gone. Just the Demons now. What I want, is to keep it that way. Move. You guys just start? Maybe. Deal me in? Cool with that? You gotta put your bet down, girl. I'll be earning cash here next week. Asking the counselor to hook me up with a job. I'll put down a weeks pay. Okay. I'll raise. Come on, bitch. Till next time, suckers. Hey, good game. Here's a consolation prize, ladies. You're all right, Kat. Thanks for the cancer. Hey, look at you, making new friends. Probably a good thing. Yeah well, see how long it keeps me alive. Hey, you're growing on 'em, but your fists in their face will do that, too. Can I ask you something? If it was about the smokes, I didn't give it to them to win them over. Gave it to them 'cause I don't smoke. You're no murderer. Why are you here? I was set up by a local gang leader. But I'll leave it at that. Less you know, safer you are. Listen, rumor is there's a way outta here. A tunnel. I'm not sure where but I know there are drugs getting in to the warden from it. I think it's basement level. What's down there now? Laundry. But I only did laundry for three weeks. That home ec shit ain't for me. Trash detail down there, too. Hm, okay. Well it gives me a start. I've got a plan. So, you're interested in a job detail? Yeah. What'd you do on the outside? What do you do? Fixed bikes. Like motorcycles. Mm-hm. That's not your everyday female occupation. I've been around bikes my whole life, so came naturally. Well, I don't know what you would do around here that's similar to that, but um, what do you want? Well, I worked at a garage. I'm used to getting sweat, blood, grease, oil, out of clothing. Laundry detail? Yeah, we could set up laundry. You mind if I make a phone call? Oh hey, before that, I write poetry too. I could try and freestyle something while you're on the phone. Pen, paper? Yeah, I'd love to read your work. Thanks. Hey Lonnie, we need to get Kat a job. I was thinking maybe laundry detail. I mean there's for sure, you can squeeze her in, right? There's gotta be one opening. Uh-huh. Okay yeah, tonight? All right. Thank you. All right, bye. Well I got good news. You got laundry if you want it. So, you interested? When can I start? Tonight after dinner. So um, we'll check in in a few days and we'll see how it's going for ya. Great, thanks. No problem. Thank you. I think you're a good person, or at least I hope. I'm not innocent in life, but innocent in why I'm here. Don't talk to or trust anyone in this facility. They're going to kill me, soon. I need your help. Kat down here? Yeah. You got mail, sweetie. Thanks. Did I get anything? Let me check. - Let me check. - Uh, no. You aint' got no mail. Who would send you mail? My brother, Dean. Please, jackass. You're the jackass. Come on, you. Let's go! - Come on. - Pervert! What the hell? Go! You're going to have to give me something, Vegas. Something. Look, I told you I don't know anything. Nothin' about the new girl. Okay. Okay look. She was asking about getting a job detail. She asked me what I thought was good. All I know is she's some fucking biker bitch and she's in for murder. - That's all. - Job detail? I don't know. She's bored? Wants to make some cash? I don't fucking know. That's not helpful. Wait, motherfucker. There is something. Word is she's innocent. Here off the record. Some gangster from upstate. Go on. That's all I know, that's it. Maybe, wait. Maybe one thing. Maybe she's a murderer, maybe she's not. But you better watch your fucking back, because she's tough enough to turn this place to dust right up. Ah, shut up. Hey, that's too bad about Vegas. Enough! Take her to solitary! Get off me. Move it! Warden, found this on her. Thoughts? Probably a showdown with one of the inmates. I don't know. What do you want us to do? Let's play. Make sure she's there on time. Surprised to see me, baby? I'm sure you know by now, Rosie's taken control. No more Hellcats, no more Vipers. Now there's just us, baby. Snake? Relax. No time for old news now. Vipers are gone temporarily. I'm here to take my outfit back. A few days ago I followed Rosie in and who I assumed to be the warden, and followed them back to this place. There's an old underground tunnel leading out of here. It's connected to solitary. That's good to know, but I'm not leaving now. No? I'm taking down the warden and I made a promise to someone. Suit yourself. I need to gather more information on Rosie's operations, get us some leverage. I'll be back in two days, 6:00 PM. Do something to get into solitary. Gets too hot around here, you know the way out. You know I wouldn't leave you in a place like this. But when things settle down and you're on the outside, we got some unfinished business between us. Till then we're a team. Deal? Doctor, I need you to come back in 30 minutes, please. Get up. Get up now. She smashed my fucking face, man! Look at this shit! Shut up and listen carefully. Kat and two guards were found unconscious earlier. Nobody saw anything. I'm warning you, this is the last time you go rogue against my instruction. Man, I didn't go rogue. I have nothing to do with this. You told me not to kill her, I haven't done shit! But you can believe this, payback is fucking coming. She stays alive, period. However, I give you permission to use whatever means necessary to find out who did this. Quickly. Something's really off here and I don't know what yet. Kat's confidant isn't talking either. Isn't talking, or doesn't know anything? Which is it? It's getting harder to keep Kat alive here, Rosie. Well that's exactly what I'm paying you to do, and a raise could be in your future. I have a very important deal going down. Which includes the largest acquisition of product we've ever had. Kat's dead, she's buried in your tomb. The Hellcats that are in my outfit now, they think she left them. Abandoned them. I don't need them finding out she died in some down state prison for a trigger that I pulled. Who could be helping her? Who would put their life on the line for her? Only one man. And he's dead. Here I thought it was cats that had nine lives. You ain't here for a try out, are ya? You're here for trouble. If I was here for trouble you'd know it already. Well then, what can I do for ya? Kat's down state, why? It's only Demons now. No place for Hellcats and Vipers anymore. We'll see about that. Mm, Rosie's merged them all. She's the only game in town. Kat's a strong woman. It's better to have her under lock and key, know what I mean? Go on. Kat got set up during a fight. Fighting for money, doesn't sound like Kat. I need something, Max. Money wasn't for her. Word is Frank needs the money, for his shop. Merger can take a toll on everyone, Snake, but Kat coming back on Rosie's turf, looking for illegal fights? Not a smart move. Rosie doesn't need a strong girl like that in her back yard. Next thing you know she's rallying her girls and there's a rebellion, and the Demons are here. Specially when Rosie's making bigger deals. Bigger deals? She's pushing more product than you ever could, Snake. No offense. None taken, Max. None taken. Here's what I propose. You give me the name of the location where Rosie's pushing drugs, weapons, whatever. You give me the name of that location within five seconds, or else I kill you within the next 48 hours and burn this place to the ground. Maybe make it my new clubhouse. Choose a side, wisely, Max. Hold on. Rosie's got a big deal going soon, but I don't know the details on it, man. All I know is she's got a lot of product coming out of that warehouse downtown. Now that's a start man, right? I know your game, Max. I know you talk. When you talk to Rosie you tell her someone was here. But not me, Snake's dead. Anything else I should know? Yeah, something to put in those memory banks. The Vipers are back. Yeah? Word on the street's the Vipers are back. Get out, come back tomorrow. Who gave you this information? A reliable source. Watch yourself. Shit. You looked pretty fine to me, but I can't say for certain without a more thorough investigation. I'll see you in my exam room tonight. Solitary, six. I'm getting scared here, Kat. Any luck finding the entrance inside of laundry? Well, it's not in laundry, but yeah, I know where it is. What? You didn't tell me. Well, the less you know the better. It's just a matter of time before they kill me. Relax, they're keeping me alive for a reason. That doesn't mean I'm safe, Kat. We're on borrowed time, both of us. Well I'm finding out more info tonight. Get the ball, ladies. Kat, confinement. Hey, Mr Buck? Hey uh, I'm about to take off for the day and I remembered you wanted to discuss your uh, your, your confidence issues. Listen, I told you that in private. Hey, don't. That is not something appropriate to talk about in public. Keep your head down, just listen. There's a big deal going down soon. I need to get more details. You need to leave, like fast. We'll talk about this later, but, in private again, please? Hang in there. - Thank you. - You'll be all right. Not yet. I need 24 hours. High noon, tomorrow. We meet at the entrance to the tunnel. One more thing, I want my bike. Who has it? Who do you think I would trust? Think you have something of mine, Frank. I thought you was dead, Snake. Yeah, I know. Relax, I'm not here for trouble. Well when you're around, there's always trouble, Snake. Maybe I shed some skin. That doesn't change who you are. The world's different around here. Everything's changed. I done retired. I done bought this farm. And sure, I still do bikes here and there. For Rosie's gang? Now you know I don't ask any questions, Snake. I just take the money. That's, that's what I always liked about you, Frank. Where's Kat? She okay? No, she's locked up down state. What? Rosie set her up. Why? She was laying low for a while. Came back, made her presence felt. Strong woman like Kat, strong woman like Rosie. There's not room enough for both of them. Now you know Kat's always been clean. You know that. Kat's in trouble, Frank. Follow me. Hey Snake. Hey. How can I help? Rosie told us this job was soon. Can you clarify that. Means soon. That's all you need to know. Go check that out. Look, it's a shit ton of product we're covering for you guys. I need to know how close it is. We ain't playing, motherfucker. Answer him. Where's the party at? Bitch. No. Maybe I'll go invite myself. Yeah? You need to be on point with this. I can't stress the importance of this deal. It's under control and on schedule. Be ready in 48. Watch your back. Let's get back to work. Dirty cops. I know I can always count on them to be there. Feel that? I need quick answers. When's the next deal? Who's it with? Bitch, she'll kill you. I'll take my chances, three seconds. Some buyer from the southeast. I don't have a name man. They'll fucking kill you, too. Soon they'll be doing business with me. No please, continue what you're doing. I haven't seen you in a while, Snake. I heard you were. Yeah. Rosie's not unreasonable. I bet she'd cut ya in. Well that's mighty generous of Rosie now. I will seriously consider that. Better than being cut out permanently. Speaking of Rosie, where can I find her? Bring up your right hand, slow. Now your left. I don't think so, Rosie. If you'll excuse me. Normally I like this kind of party, but not tonight. Here I thought Kat had nine lives. Speaking of Kat, why? Times change. Look around, Snake. If you weren't as stubborn as you are, you actually might like it. I doubt it. You know, Kat's replaceable. Expendable. It's time you see this. This could be mutually beneficial. You know, you two are seriously fucked up. And now that Kat's put away, for good, so I just unfucked your fucked up relationship. You're welcome. Guess what I got? You know I like what you've done with my place since I've been gone. Yeah, stay out of my way and you'll see what I can really do. Sure. 60 for you, 40 for me? 90 me, 10 you, and I don't put a price on your head. I can be so generous. Every one percenter within striking distance will come and exterminate you for me. Look Rosie, I don't have some of your drugs, I have all your drugs. We'll meet in two days and I'll bring every bag of it, provided Kat's alive and in one piece. If I even suspect you're tailing me, if I suspect you're pressing me, I'll torch every gram of it. I'll be in touch. You're up. You have a visitor. Kat, I didn't expect to see you in here. You know when you're in trouble you're supposed to come see me, not anyone else, me. I know. You know? Then why you sitting there and I'm sitting over here? I messed up, Frank. I wanted to make some quick cash. Heard there were fights going down. In Rosie's back yard? I was doing it for your business, Frank. I know the yard is hurting. That's my business, I'll manage. It's our problem. Look, there's no one to trust here. I'm sure that they're probably listening now, so watch what you say. I got something to show you. You got that? It was nice seeing you, Kat. I'll see you soon. Zoom in. Enhance that. Find out what that paper says. It doesn't really work like that, ma'am. Do it anyway. Lunch. I'll get that fucker, believe it, you'll see. Fuck you, Kat! We're cool now, right? Orders, Warden? Confinement, both of them. Infirmary first for the other? Take them both to confinement, now! We're going to make this quick. All these shenanigans are making me anxious, impatient. I'm going to ask you direct questions and I expect short, direct answers. I warn you, I can become impatient. I need a fucking doctor! Rosie, whatever you know of her, drugs, meetings, associates, talk. Talk, Kat! Drop it! Now! You, unlock her. You, drop your gear and sit down. Okay, now cuff yourself to your boyfriend over there. Move it! Now what, Kat? Where exactly are you going to go? We're leaving. There's no where to run. I don't need to run. Can I help you with something, doc? You know, I'm pretty sure this violated patient confidentiality laws. No, get the fuck off of me! Get off of me! Get that bitch! Thanks, Phil. You shouldn't be here. I don't want you to get wrapped up into this. Hey, don't worry about me. I have a plan, okay? So this is it, isn't it? You are gonna make a great doctor one day. I just know it. Frank! I'm sorry. Are you gonna make me go through this again? Kat, you're the only family I have, you know? Sorry. Frank, get them safe. What about the warden? It's taken care of. Are you going to Rosie? Yeah. To give her back her drugs. Yeah, about that. I changed my mind. I think I'm gonna keep her drugs and then I'm gonna show up to her little meeting and I'm gonna take out anybody that shows up with her. Vipers are back, baby. You're not going alone. I owe you now. Kat. After this, we're even. No more bad blood. There's tools in the barn if you need 'em. I actually see this going really well. Oh God. I'm glad I missed. Tools? Tools. I don't see what belongs to me here. You know it's funny, Rosie. I leave after a little hiatus and come back and I don't have what's mine, either. But that changes now. You're playing your cards wrong here. But I knew you'd fuck things up. Fuck it up for yourself, anyway. What, a waste. It's too bad, blondie, we could have made a lot of money together. I'd like to cut you to pieces and leave you lying here baking under the sun. Vultures come, wolves come, it's the way you deserve to go. Normally I see the value of every low life around here, but you, even with all your value, you're dangerous, and I like it. But how long? How long till your next little revolution here? How long till you try to rise up again? Finish this. Not in cold blood, Snake. Your way of life isn't my way. If you were doing it her way, you'd be locked up forever. No Frank, no life, no hope. Look at her. Darn it, look at her. Let that image burn in. You know why? 'Cause she'd do it again. Do it, Kat. Do it. You did the right thing. Proud of you. Hey. I'm going to get Vegas. I trust I can leave you two, right? So I'm thinking me and you have some unfinished business. What do we do now? I won't live this life. But I won't stand in your way. I won't run forever. What if you could? Hey.
