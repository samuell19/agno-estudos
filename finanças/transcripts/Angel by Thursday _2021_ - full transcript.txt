Exhibit C in the appendix illustrates the impact of your export earnings. It's phenomenal. Correct. Can't be stressed enough. Yeah, I'm still here, sorry. Absolutely, I'll draw up the documents. Be in touch. Ciao. Mima? Is this some kind of a joke? I miss you too. There's nothing I'd rather do. I'd love to, but right now... Connections are my career, okay? We've been over that. I'll call. - Toby, Clint, no. - Boys, stop. - Hey. - Hey. So, what do you think? Intriguing, isn't it? What do I think? I think you're reaching for something that's not there. What if it is for real? What if there's a chance? Wouldn't that be fantastic? I can't believe you'd consider going to Hawaii on some idiotic whim over going to this award ceremony for me. Don't you realize what this recognition means for my career? Millions. No, I need you there. That is so selfish. What's happened to you? I'm not selfish. Just realistic. Where have you been all afternoon? I called several times. Where do you think? At work. You know what? Just go do this little expedition of yours. I don't care. This isn't little, Hans. It's the first time I've had any sign that... Look at this writing, Julia. Tell me some stupid little kid didn't write the wrong address. Farfetched, I know. And maybe I'm, but it's a feeling I can't explain. Feeling? That's a real good reason to go halfway around the world. Where are you going? Out. What about our anniversary? I made dinner. Go to this event for me, or we're through. It's your choice. Seriously? Hey Krista, it's me, Julia, calling to see how you've been. Okay, I'm not. If that Hawaii offer is still good, I'd like to take you up on using your vacation home and a car for a few days. What do you say? I can't believe it. What a miracle. You do understand, things will never be the same. We were engaged three years ago before he left. This is all I've ever wanted. Greg's lucky to have you. Keep in mind the services we offer here. You're not alone. Thanks, I think we'll be fine. Isn't this exciting, honey, to finally be coming home? Sure. Sara! Sara! Sara, shut that fuckin' baby up! Mommy's got you. Sara, Sara, Sara, Sara! Sara. It's okay, mommy's got you. Sara! Sara! Fucking baby. Are you ignoring me? Don't ever ignore me again. You are fucking ignoring me, just like they did. Get the fuck away from me. Get the fuck away from me. Get the fuck. This is all your fucking fault. Greg, I'm so sorry. Please, put it down. Just put it down. I want it to stop. I want it to fucking stop. No, Greg, Please don't do that. Greg, I will get you help. No! Give that fucking baby to me. - No. - I will do it my way. - No. - Give the baby to me. You fucking whore! How you doing? Doing okay today. It's not what I'd hoped. We knew this was coming. It's faster than planned. I know. Ever wish you could have a do-over? Another chance at something? Med school. I don't know what I was thinking, putting myself through that. What about you? Only one. But it doesn't matter anymore. How you doing on meds? Good, no pain. So truthfully, how long am I looking at here? Just promise me you'll make every minute count. Thank you for everything, Tess. If you need anything. I'll be alright. You're on vacation? I'm not sure. This is the right floor, isn't it? I don't know, how should I know? You're no help. Yes, I think this must be it. I was beginning to worry. So was I. Um, must must be this other one. I'm not sure what's wrong. May I? Sure. She said fourth floor near the elevators. That's not a Beamer key. You... you gotta be kidding me. No way. I'm not driving this. No, please, please don't load my things. I'm going to rent a different car. Sir, I'm going to find phone number for the information desk, and I'm going to rent a different car. There's a huge wedding convention in town, and everything is sold out. This is ridiculous. How do you know? There's gotta be something for me. Maybe. I don't know. Information desk. I need a car rental phone number, please. Oh yeah, booya. 824579, calling in a traffic violation. A little fast back there, weren't you, ma'am? License and registration, please. I'm sorry, officer, I didn't realize I was... Of course you didn't. Excuse me a minute. Jerk. What am I doing here? Essential, I need you to run the license plate. Juliet Sierra November 1-0-0. I copy, Juliet Sierra November 1-0-0, standing by. Ma'am, you might drive that fast on the Autobahn, but out here, not a good idea. Look, Officer. Tobias. Officer Tobias. I was wrong, I admit it. My mind was elsewhere. A little slack would be appreciated, being my first time here. Mmhmm. Sign the bottom, please. What about all this "aloha" I've heard about on the plane? No other place like it. I thought it's supposed to mean caring for and helping people. Among other things, yeah. Could have fooled me. Maybe you should think of it this way. This ticket is aloha. I care that you won't kill yourself, or worse - somebody else. Can I go? Absolutely, as soon as we take care of that at the station. What? I'm sure you're honest. I can't believe you thought I'd skip. Tourists, especially international, tend to forget these minor details, so you can either pay now at the station, or set a court date. You gotta be kidding me. Both excellent choices, I might add. You can follow me. Here. Drink. Much better now. Thank you, honey. Sit for awhile, keep me company. There's something that I need to tell you. Story, now? Of course. But first, you know I'm very sick, right? I'm going to be leaving soon. Do you understand what that means? Away, far. That's right, far away. Sad, alone. No, you won't be alone. No, alone you. You are the kindest man. I won't be alone. I love you very much. You will always be with me. I need a promise that you'll help your brother out with things around here, okay? Your chores, brushing your teeth, making your bed. He works very hard for all of us, and he's counting on you. Promise, okay. There's something that I want just you to be responsible for. Can, yes. Take care of our Rosie. She'll be sad at first, but just give her lots of hugs and treats like you always do, and she'll be fine. Squirts too? Especially her whipped cream. Mmm, like. How about we read now? I'd like that. This one is called Reflection. Although I will be gone soon, as I reflect on our years a while, your face from some far-off place I see laughing - and I smile. Kahuku thanks you, ma'am. Stop calling me that, makes me feel old. No disrespect. You know, not trusting me - that's disrespect. What does it say about humanity if the element of trust breaks down like it did just now? I trusted you to obey the law. Look within yourself to find the answer to that, Ms. Denis. Need help getting there? What? Your postcard on your front seat. Waimea. Help from you? Yeah. Get real. And by the way, clean your uniform. Hey, how are we doing? Okay, but I just wanted to let you know that Toby had a little accident, and his pills went in the toilet. You're kidding. Okay, I'll be right there. Mr. Tobias, are you absolutely sure this is what you want? This is something I have to do. Lifetime custody is a huge responsibility. Even under normal circumstances. Toby's condition, it's not gonna make it any easier. Toby is not going to get lost in the system. No. He's all I have left. It's not just about him, it's about both of us. Well, it looks like all the other requirements are in order. Great. I'll submit for review. Good luck. Clint, hi. Auntie said your medicine ended up in the toilet. How'd that happen? Um, boo boo. Why were you playing with it in the first place? Spin. Spin? Like. So, you didn't take it today? Uh-uh. Shit. Jesus, Toby, you know I'm working, right? Policeman. So, you know I don't have time for this. I cannot believe this. Come on. No, no, no, no, no. This is not a toy, got it? Stop. Clint Tobias? Oh my God. Hey, hi. I haven't seen you since high school. I'm sorry, this is really embarrassing. Kathy Miller. How could you forget? Kathy... Kathy Miller, yeah. Hey, I'm sorry, it's been a long time. No kidding. So, how have you been? We've been good. Just busy with work and things. Well, there's something about a man in uniform. You look fantastic. Thanks, so do you. No secrets here, I'm divorced. But I just moved back, and I would love to catch up. Sure, yeah, that'd be great. Toby. We don't do that, remember? Here, I'll take that, Kathy. No. No, no, go. Will you knock it off? Go. Well, it was really great to see you. What is wrong with you? Car go, fast vroom. You better not be bluffing just to get out of trouble. No, go, go. Okay, where are we going? Because I'm in no mood for games. Games, uh-uh. Road, go. Put your seatbelt on. It's on, good. Special. Not while I'm driving, you know better. Stop. What? There. Right there. What's wrong? Back, back, back, back. This isn't funny. No, there, stop. Toby. Toby. Toby, get back in the car. Back in the car now. There, go. Get in the car. Hurry, now. Get in the car. - Hurry, now. - The car was moving. I could have ran over you. Get in the car. Ow. Put your seat belt on. - Clint, back. - Put your seat... Back, Clint. Back, back. Put your seatbelt on. No, no, Clint, back. Toby, sit down, stay still. I could have ran you over. Don't ever do that again. Where am I? Who do I call? No signal. What the hell? How did you know? Auntie. Auntie? Uh-huh. No. Thank you. Oh, my God. Not you. Julia Denis. How are you this fine evening? How do you think? Beautiful sunset, isn't it? I bet you don't get many of these when it's 40 below and your car is frozen. I hate a smart ass, especially when it's getting dark outside and I don't know where I am. Having a problem? You're a genius, Officer Tobias. Clint. What? Name's Clint. Okay, Clint. Yes, there seems to be a problem. Thank you for stopping. You're welcome. Well, it looks serious. Not much I can do about it. And I'm pretty sure Jerry in town is not going to be able to fix anything this fancy. Where are you going? Are you leaving me out here? I recall someone very adamant this afternoon about no assistance. It's been a long day. I'm tired, he's tired. Time to go home. Look. Wait. I was mad about this whole ticket thing, and that and a horribly long flight just made things worse. I believe the exact words were, "Help from you? Get real." I didn't mean it. I'm sorry. Stop playing. Hurt, don't. You know, you really need to start listening to me. You didn't really think I'd leave you out here, did you? That's really funny. Right. Striking the uniform, that's a Class A felony. Then I'm afraid you'll just have to arrest me, officer. Well, that can be arranged. What are you starting here, a shopping mall? Just being prepared. For what? End of days? My fortune teller said it was in the cards. I hope you are ready. I get it now. Get what? High maintenance, definitely loony. Hop in the back, tiger, we got company. Hi. Oh, sorry. This is Toby. Hi, Toby. Did I do something? Uh no. No, he's like that with everyone. Won't get a word out of him sometimes. Tiger, this is Julia. Thursday, now. Friend, best. Nice. What's her name? Auntie Sara. Really? You have beautiful hair just like your great-grandmother. Sara was her name, too, you know? That's pretty. Just like you. You're the best, Jules. Julia, are you okay? Yeah, I'm just jetlagged. Fine. He must really like you, because he never usually says much to strangers. Who is Sara? She's our nanny. Thinks the world of him. Looks like you guys are both blessed she's in your life. Yeah. Life dealt him a horrible hand. She's been a jewel in our lives for many years. Clint sad? No, I'm good, tiger. I'm good. Me tiger. I see that! No. No. No. Home. - What? - Home. - What is it, Toby? - Home. Home. - Toby? - Home. Home. Home. Home. - Okay, okay, okay, okay. - Home, home. - Okay, calm down, calm down. - Home. - What's the matter? - Home. Home. Home. What's going on? Home. Home. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, calm down. Go now. Calm down. You wait. No, now. - What's going on, Clint? - Home. - Is he okay? - Home, home. Home, home. - Something not good. - Home. Home. Sara? Sara? Auntie? Sara. No, no no... Hey, hey. Sara! Sara, wake up, wake up, wake up. Auntie, please. Sara. Auntie, please. Auntie, please. Auntie, please. Please. Auntie, please. Sara. Sara. Can you hear me? Sara? Can you hear me? Wake up, wake up. I can't believe this. What? Auntie, please. - Sara. - Auntie, please. - Sara. - Auntie, please. Auntie, please. Can you hear me? Auntie, please. Auntie, please. I don't like this place, why can't we leave? We've been through this already, Jules. Here. Really? Absolutely. My princess forever. You're why I always carry this - to remind me. I love you so much. No, really. No, really You don't have to thank me, because I got this special for you. Go ahead, take a look at that. Go ahead, make a choice, try them, they're great. They are beautiful. I really don't like this place. Why can't we leave, Mima? Just let me take care of this. You mean to tell me you don't like my goodies, my candies? Chocolates from Switzerland? Leave her alone. Bullshit! I'm going to tell you something as if I'm your uncle, okay? You're not my uncle. Julia, stop it right now. Where you live, the air is thin. You are not your brain. You are the user of your brain. So, you know what you've got to ask yourself right now, right here? Two questions. Question number one, how am I feeling right now? Question number two, is this feeling good for me? Once you ask yourself those two fucking questions, maybe your brain will improve your health. Really? That's it, leave us alone. Get the fuck out of here. Go on, get the fuck out of there. You're not nice, I don't like you. - Julia, go, just go. - Boom, boom, boom, boom. Boom boom boom boom. She didn't mean it, Rosales, I'm sorry. Okay. Okay. Okay. I want my stuff. - I can't hear you. - I want my stuff. - You want your stuff? - Yes, please. It's full of shit, I need it now. You need it now. Come to daddy. You're a very messy white woman, you know. You counted all this money? Yes. - How much? - All there, it's 1,500. 1,500... Beautiful. Beautiful. Did you make this money pole dancing? 'Cause look, these are looking not so good. You know what I mean? Are you a gardener? Does it matter where it came from? Just... Okay. All there, right? Yes. You want something from me, right? Here we go. Red heads - they're so hot. Say hello to all your little friends. Right there. I'm gonna go put this money aside. Just just leave me alone. Get out of here. You got what you need, I got what I need. And I'm gonna leave. And I got what you need. You got what I need. You're a singer, right? Just leave me alone. - Sing a little song. - Shut up. Nice doing business with you, my dear. Julia?! Julia?! Julia, come on, let's go! Sara Denis, Oakland PD, we have a warrant, open up! Did you bring the cops here? - No, I didn't, I promise. - You have them follow you? Let go of me! You bitch. Follow me. You promise you didn't bring the cops...? No, I didn't I swear. That's good. 'Cause the kicked dog bites hardest! Jules! Jules! Please, my baby. Don't move. Don't even think about it. My baby, please don't hurt her. Julia! Clear. Where is she, Sara? - I'll go upstairs. - I don't know. Please, don't hurt her. Sara Denis, you are under arrest for possession of narcotics and endangering the welfare of a child. Clear. Julia? Clear. Clear. Julia? Julia. Hey, Julia, I'm a police officer. I'm not gonna hurt you, okay? I need you to come with me, okay, Julia? I need you to come with me. Come on, let's get out of the tub. Good girl, come on. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay, everything's gonna be okay. Where are you going? Don't you take her, goddammit! I'm scared, don't let them take me! Nobody's gonna hurt you, I promise. Please, don't take her, she's all I got. Mima, Mima! Julia! Julia! Finally! It's nice of you to join us. We're here. Welcome back. Auntie okay. My precious boys. You know, the next time you want attention, just ask. It's free. She scared the heck out of all of us. All? Huh? Julia. Here. Julia? Yeah, a friend from Berlin. Hi, Mima. Your mother? Happy, happy, happy! Julia. After all these years, I cannot believe this. There's so much I wanted to tell you. Come on, let's go. I love you. I love you, too, Mima. I love you, too. Mima? Mima! Mima! Clint, she's... No, no no... - What's wrong? What's wrong? - Uh-uh, uh-uh. - Mima, please. - Uh-uh. - Okay, call 9.. call 91. - Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Call 911. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. - Toby, you're not helping. - Uh-uh, uh-uh. Uh-uh. Come on, come on, come on. Uh-uh, uh-uh. How come you're not doing anything? Because I can't! - Uh-uh. - Come on! CPR, I know how, help me. Uhuh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. We have to, come on. Help me get her down. It's her medical directive, Julia. No resuscitation. We just found each other. Come on, you've gotta help me, please. This is so not fair! I've missed you so much, Mima. Do you understand what happened? Die. Yeah. She was a wonderful person, and we were very lucky to have her in our lives. Die, why? It's just what happens. Happens to all of us. Clint even? Yeah. Even me. I know I'm hard on you sometimes, and I'm sorry. Shishi, fast. Go. Don't forget to raise the seat. And don't miss. Clint. Clint. Clint. Clint. What, what? What, what? Hurry, now. Jesus, Toby, do you know what time it is? Go away, no breakfast. Trouble, bad. Die. What? What? Uh-huh. Flashlight. Jesus. Oh, man. Hurry. Just wanted sleep. Where are we going, and who is dying at 2:00 in the morning? Oh, man. Toby? Toby! Clint! No! Help! Toby. - You stop, bad. - Hey. Hey, get out of here. Bad. Bad. You okay? This is what you meant? Uh-huh. Happy, safe. Auntie surprise? Yes. Yes, Auntie's gonna love that. You got a name for it? Rosie. Okay, can I get some sleep now? It's cute. Hey. Kona coffee. I assumed you drink, but I wasn't sure how you like it. It's fine, thank you. I had no idea she was your mother. Shock to both of us, I guess. Yeah. I asked about this once. All she said was - it was a terrible tragedy, and I assumed the girl - you - had died. You have no idea. This was the last thing my mom gave me before I was taken. What do you mean taken? I was 10. She was a drug dealer, that's why they locked her up. And you never saw her again? No, just another ghost on the adoption wall. Toby and I were adopted, too. Then you know what I mean. As a child, you only tend to remember the moment. I remember her brushing my hair and her kisses good night. But in the 25 years since, she never once tried to connect. How can you abandon someone you supposedly loved? Well, why do you assume she abandoned? My adoption case was closed, so I get it, no way to track me down. But I'm all over social media now. I just, I don't see it. Sara - she's the kindest soul. Always putting... putting others first... always pu... Do you think out of guilt? No. I think... I think her way of never forgetting you. Hey, tiger. Good morning. Mmm. Yummy. Like. That looks wonderful, I'm starving. For me? Thank you. You got to try this. It's good. Nothing like parched perfection. Looks like Toby's okay. Oh my God! She kept a scrapbook of me! Did you know about this? No, but I'm not surprised in the least. Oh, wow. We used to go to the park. It was so much fun. You? Yes! I can't believe this. How old is this article? It's only six months old. Well, looks like there's your answer. She never gave up on you. Excuse me for a moment. Sure. Come on, boys, finish up, time's a-wastin'! Yeah, big day at the beach, unless you want to stay home, clean your room and not go swimming. No way! Come on, Clint, hurry up! Toby, you know better than that. He started it. I didn't do anything. Done, going outside. - Wait! - Hold on, mister, not until you're finished. I'm full, I'm up to my gills. You want outside? Two more bites. Okay, that's great. Go on. Wait. Aww, now what? Oh, you're much too handsome to go outside looking like that. Wait up, Clint. There's actually such a thing called silence. Whose idea was this, anyways? Thank you so much, Mr. Tobias. For what? For them. You gave up a lot. No, I didn't. As soon as we saw them, I knew they were ours. I love you. Mom! Dad! The super wedgie. He's gonna... Ahhhhhh! What were we thinking? Can I ask you a question? Sure. In the car, Toby knew something was wrong. Is it normal for him? Yep. As a matter of fact, he was that way with you, too. What do you mean? Your car trouble, where you were. He knew exactly, and was emphatic that we hurry because of darkness. That's a little different. He's had this ability since the accident. Accident? Something that happened a long time ago. I just learned to listen to him. Do you think he could have sent this to me? The postcard on your front seat? Huh. Urgent Thursday Mima. Hm. That's what I used to call her. Well, he likes to draw but, you know, something this... Like this and then posting it? I mean... It's just way too complicated. This is why I'm here. Someone sent this to me with a Kahuku postmark. You're thousands of miles away in Berlin. He struggles to tie his own shoelaces. It had to be Sara. But the writing?! She had a stroke. I know she struggled with that. Yeah, maybe you're right. Hi. What's up, tiger? Happy? No, gone. Sad. Tiger! Who, who... Me too. Who are you talking to? Auntie. Sara? Mom's here now? Uh-huh. Okay. I never stopped loving you, Jules. Wait, no go. Jules? That's what she used to call me! Do you think it's possible? I don't know. I mean, maybe. Every day is a mystery with him. Come on, we got something to do. Something real chicken skin. What? Ooh, look. Boat big. Yeah! What are we doing, Clint? You won't be disappointed. That I guarantee. There he is, Toby. Uncle Ryan! It's Uncle Ryan! Uncle Ryan! My man, Toby! How you been? Happy, happy. Hey, you ready to be my first mate? Anchor. I'm going to need you out there. Sail. Thanks for the short notice, yeah? Oh, no worries, brother. Ryan, this is Julia. Hi. Welcome to the North Shore. Thank you. Pleasure to meet you. Ryan and I go back a ways. Yeah, junior high. Enduring friendship, that's nice. It's pretty cool. Go, now? Yeah, we probably should get going so we can get there in time. In time for what? Secret, big. I don't know. Don't look at me, I'm just the captain. You guys. Trust me, it's worth the wait, come on. This is fantastic. Where are we going? Your postcard. Hey Julia, take the helm. No, no, no guys, I've never sailed before. Don't worry, he's got plenty of insurance. Plenty of insurance. If we do have a water landing, exits are pretty much all the way around the boat. I think I'll pass on taking the wheel. You are such a jerk. And so are you, Captain Ryan. I don't forget, you know. Okay, matey, let-er-go! Wow! So, what do you think of your postcard? It's really nice. I love it. The sound and the smell of the ocean. It's beautiful. How did... how did you and mom meet? Actually, it's because of Toby. It had to have been 1998. Mom has been here 15 years? Matter of fact, we met her the first day here. It was the Honolulu State Services Building. I had just been granted legal custody of Toby... and I had no idea how I was going to take care of him. How did mom fit into this? Toby went nuts. I mean, you know how he gets? Yeah. I had a taste. He had us visit the most obscure bulletin board on the planet. That's odd. Yeah. I mean, we were going around corners, downstairs. And there she was. Mmhmm. Posting an ad for nanny services. Call it luck, or fate, or Toby being Toby. It really felt like we won the lottery. And as it turns out, we did. Do you think it was meant to be? Absolutely. Without a doubt. I mean, how else can you explain the last 30 hours? It's been eventful, that's for sure. This was your mother's favorite spot. She used to come out here just to watch the... Just to watch the surf. Usually, there's these monster waves that break clear across. This is so tranquil. Now. Don't let it fool you. What do you mean? Earlier you asked about Toby - the accident? - I'm sorry. - No, that's okay. It wasn't my business prying. It's okay. It happened here. I remember it like it was yesterday. That was a beautiful day in Waimea. Our parents brought us to have a nice picnic and play at the beach. We'd been looking forward to it all week. Those waves, I can't believe people are out there! Eddie lived for days like this. Who is Eddie? Eddie Aikau. Legendary surfer, legendary Waterman. When he was a lifeguard over here, Eddie saved maybe 500 lives. 500? Hard to believe, huh brother? The love he had for this 'aina, the love he had for this place and the people that came here - incredible! What happened to Eddie? Eddie died trying to save some friends. Oh. We headed down to the water, and I remember wanting to swim so badly. My parents insisted no, because the surf was way too big. It's too big. Dad. Come on, dad, look, there's nothing, flat as a pancake. Please, come on. Please, can we go? Flat as a pancake. I don't know. Dad, please. We'll just be up to our knees. - We just want to go. - No, boys. It's too dangerous, you guys gotta go play over there. There is perfect. I didn't listen. I went into the water anyways, and Toby followed me. He was staring at me with this big smile on his face. Out of nowhere, this huge wave came and washed us both away. Stop! Hey hey kids, stop. Toby, Clint, no! No boys, stop! I came up. I couldn't see anything but the water churning around me, and I was choking, I couldn't catch my breath. I couldn't find Toby. He disappeared. My parents rushed in to save us... and they disappeared, too. That was the last time I saw them. The local people did everything they could to help. They pulled Toby out of the ocean, and he wasn't breathing. And all I can remember was looking down at him and saying, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry." "I didn't mean for that to happen." That's why he is the way he is. Look, it was an accident. It wasn't an accident. - It was. - It wasn't my fault. I was being stupid. It was an accident. No, it wasn't. You were a kid having fun. I was being stupid, and it was my fault. It's completely my fault. You can't think that. You were a kid having fun. - No, it wasn't. - You were just a little kid, who didn't know any better. I wish I could believe that! Clint? I can't let them see me like this. I need a minute. Now? Yeah, buddy, get it from uncle Ryan. What is it, Toby? Surprise - ooo! Ooo?! Thank you. All right! Let's get started. So, what's the surprise? Well, earlier I said chicken skin. You're looking at it. Chickens inside? There's definitely something weird about you. Oh, yeah. You're so gullible, Julia that's twice in one day. You are so easily amused. Shallowness is a great quality in a man. Clint funny. Yeah, buddy. So, whose side are you on? Huh? Time for a new brother. - Now can, please? - Yeah, yeah, go, go. Whoa, slow down, slow down. Ooo. Here. You. It's beautiful, but what is it? Floating lanterns. Let me guess, it's a Hawaiian tradition? Asian, actually. Mommy, daddy. According to Japanese Buddhism, the flame represents soul set free, grief let go, and memories of loved ones never to fade. Jules, my hope is forgiveness. My prayer, that peace and happiness found you. My fear, you never knew how much I loved you. Forever, Mima. Is this some kind of a joke? No. This is what we were supposed to do yesterday. Yesterday? But why yesterday? On the day she died? Help me out here. Because it marks the day of our accident. What? It's also the day we met. All this on one day? What was the date yesterday? July 18th. This is so strange, Clint, so bizarre. What? July 18th, 25 years ago was the last time I saw her! How can this be? The universe lining up a part of some gigantic plan? I don't know. But we've done this every year, and Sara started this tradition in remembrance of you. These empty years. I just wish we had them back. Me, too. Sad, no. Here. Write to her, Julia. It's an amazing connection. It was you, wasn't it, Toby? Was what? The postcard! He sent it. Did you? Uh-uh, no me. You're not in trouble tiger, but we always tell the truth. Did you send it? How did you know? How did you know? How did you know she'd die on a Thursday? And how did you find me? Pau. Oh. There you go. Easy. Bye, Mommy. Bye, Daddy. Bye, Auntie. Clint, here. Oh, thanks tiger. A little nippy out tonight, huh? Thank you. Hey. Your brother is so... What? Just reflecting. Was she happy, Clint? She is now. I love you so much, Mima. ♪ Every day, in the shadows of a broken heart, ♪ ♪ Trying to find you. ♪ ♪ But they say, stars shine brightest in the dark, ♪ ♪ Been waiting for a breakthrough. ♪ ♪ But only heaven knows which way to go ♪ ♪ To heal my soul ♪ ♪ I might have taken the longer road, ♪ ♪ But I'm finding my way home. ♪ ♪ And now I know that I am not alone, ♪ ♪ Yeah, I'm finding my way home... ♪ ♪ Finding my way home, ♪ ♪ Finding my way home where I belong. ♪ ♪ Finding my way home ♪ ♪ Finding my way, my way home. ♪ ♪ All this time, you've been an angel in the shadows ♪ ♪ Always beside me, beside me. ♪ ♪ In your eyes, I see your love and how it echoes ♪ ♪ Forever in my memory. ♪ ♪ I might have taken the longer road, ♪ ♪ But I'm finding my way home. ♪ ♪ And now I know that I am not alone, ♪ ♪ Yeah, I'm finding my way home... ♪ ♪ Finding my way home, ♪ ♪ Finding my way home where I belong. ♪ ♪ Finding my way home ♪ ♪ Finding my way, my way home. ♪ ♪ Oh, life is such a beautiful mystery ♪ ♪ Into the great unknown. ♪ ♪ And it seems everything is meant to be, ♪ ♪ 'Cause in the end, love conquers all. ♪ ♪ I might have taken the longer road, ♪ ♪ But I'm finding my way home. ♪ ♪ And now I finally know I'm not alone, ♪ ♪ Yeah, I'm finding my way home... ♪ ♪ Finding my way home, ♪ ♪ Finding my way home where I belong. ♪ ♪ Finding my way home ♪ ♪ Finding my way, my way home. ♪ For me, it's very exciting, because what I see involved with everybody who's here is just a whole bunch of love. Everybody cares. That's the secret word - caring. And everybody here that's involved with what's going on - cares. They care. And the product, because of that, the product will be important - because it's important to the people who are doing it. If all of us do stuff like that, if we go and make a commitment to something we believe in, then all of a sudden, dying is irrelevant. You can carry that with you the rest of your life. The rest of your life. That's it. That's really it. That's the epitome of why you are here. That's what this movie is about. People trying to live their life the best that they can.
