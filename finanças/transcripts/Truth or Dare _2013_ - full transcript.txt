We have all of our crew back here again. You folks already know John. This is my lovely girlfriend, Jennifer right there holding the gun. Thank you very much, baby. My sister Courtney. Michelle. And the man of the hour, Tony. Alright guys. For today's episode of Truth or Dare... We are going to play a slightly altered version of Russian Roulette. We were going to play it the old-fashioned way... But Tony backed out because he doesn't have the balls to aim the gun at himself. So I volunteered to shoot him. Real funny. Tony, stand still. Dude, its easy for you to say. You're not the one looking down the barrel of a fucking gun, dude! Come on, stop it. If I keep laughing then I am going to lose aim. And then we are just going to take it all over again. Yeah, you guys. Quit laughing. Quit making her laugh. I'm serious, shut the fuck up right now! Jen, could you just point that thing off to the side a little bit more, up higher? I explained this to you already. We don't aim it right, it won't look real. If it doesn't look real, we're gonna lose audience. He's right. I just have to aim it at your face. John, you know what. We should do that, that, that, vampire idea of Ray's. That one is so good. Remember, you loved it. You were laughing about it for like 20 minutes in the car the other night. Plus, that vampire stuff is so hot right now, dude. Please! No. I definitely think we need to do this one. This one is going to guarantee the greatest number of views. Tony, you gotta remember, more views equal more money. And besides, I'm kind of enjoying watching you squirm a little bit. Could you not fucking point that thing at me when I'm talking to them? Come on! We're going through with this. I'm not going to ask you again. Stand still. Jen, I can't do this. Look at me right now, please. I am not ready for this. I'm begging you, stop! Please! Fine. Thank you. I'm gonna give you until the count of three. One. Whoa, wait! Are you firing on three or right after? Two. I'm asking you a question, Jen! Three! I don't know what happened! *Various News Anchor Dialogue * The newest video from the Truth or Daredevils... My children should not be watching people dying. Currently making rounds, on the talk show circuit, discussing their controversial video. Young college student. So please give an extra warm welcome to the multi-talented members of the Truth or Daredevils! Now, it's been a couple of weeks since you uploaded the video that shocked the world... And catapulted you guys into superstardom. So this latest video is more violent and it's really different in tone from the others. Well, Jen and I wanted to produce a video that we could get a couple thousand views. I said, "Heck yeah let's do it!" And you know Jen, she's a really good girl. My lawyer kept telling me they couldn't convict me without finding a body, but you never know. Wow. Speaking of missing bodies, I have one last guest for us today. Please help me welcome, Tony! I'm alive! Who knew? Okay, Tony. Obviously we know that you were not killed, or actually even shot, so where were you? Just laying low, drinking beer, living the dream. Bobbi, it's just nice to know that I'm important, you know. And it's just nice to know that everyone else is starting to realize that too. Keep it alive, because I am going to open the floor for questions. Okay! Good. Because I've got a question! I've been sending messages for like weeks, like Facebook and Twitter. And like, Jen, I sent you a letter. Why don't you respond to your fans? If we answered every email, we'd never leave the house. You're funny. Don't laugh at me! Look, I've supported you guys since the very, very beginning, okay. I want to be a member of the Truth or Daredevils. I'm not going to back out on dares like Tony does. I can follow the rules, I should be a member, you know, I'm your guy, I'm your guy... Okay, now I can join then, right? Hey buddy, you know the rules! Wait, no! I want to be on TV! I want to be on TV! I want to be a member of the group! Get him out of here! Put me in the next video! What can we expect to see in your next video? Well, we don't want to give away in spoilers, but what we can tell you... Is that you'll have another new video before the end of the week. And that its gonna rock! More me! I'm with the group! I'm with the group! Quit your whining or I'll do more than just kick your ass out of this studio. Freaking pathetic! I don't know, man. I mean, there is no sign of civilization for miles. I mean, why would you buy property in the middle of nowhere? This place was a bargain. You know what? This is my house and I'm a homeowner at 27. How many people can say that? Oh. We've been having some issues with the plumbing, so if you need to use the restroom... You're probably going to have to pop a squat outside. The uh, plumbers will be here in the morning. I'm glad you spent so much money on the place. You may not like it, but I do. And it's mine, understand? I'm glad you like it, because you're going to be living out here for a very long time. I mean, you're never going to be sell it for anything. Who the fuck would want to live out in the middle of nowhere? Hey, as long as John-boy keeps this place stocked with booze, who gives a shit? Anyway, I figure we'll shoot the next video in the new setup. You guys are going to love it. Sounds good to me, baby New setup? You'll see. So. Hope you guys all remembered to bring your pajamas. I assumed you figured something out, Courtney. Oh yes, I have something great to wear. We have ours. Well, I brought mine but Tony didn't have any because he likes to sleep naked. Oops. Alright. We're gonna go change. Lights and props are already down there. Grab my laptop. So. What do you think? Oh, dude this is awesome. John, you are a genious, man! Babe, why didn't you tell me about this? This is not what I was expecting Me neither, what's the point of this exactly? It's for our new video. I just wanted a place we can film, uninterrupted. Well, plus a few of the fans wrote some detailed letters about how they didn't like the background. They uh, it wasn't quite in those words, they kept calling it gay and kept calling Tony a fag. Hey! Not my words. And, this is the best you could come up with? Look, if fans don't like it, we'll change it for the next video. Well, fucking-A, let's rage! We have work to do. Remember, Tony? Uh, is that a fucking revolver on the table? You guys, I thought we were done with the guns. It's Russian Roulette, round 2. Only this time, we're gonna play the right way. No backing out of this video. Well, the last time didn't count. And why is that? Because I didn't have any booze in my system. Yeah, that's definitely a first. Too bad I won't be able to shoot you in the face this time. Well yeah, I went last time so, someone else is going this time, I'm looking at Ray. Sorry, our fans enjoy seeing you get shot. We have to give them what they want. Fine. Well, how are we even going to do this? The gun has a blank in it. So it'll look like we're playing for real. And give us something to show to the camera. Just don't press it close to your head. Wait, wait a minute. You said blank. I mean, isn't the point of a blank is that it shoots, nothing? A blank still has gunpowder in it, Tony. How do you think it makes the noise, and the flash? Cool. Alright, alright. Enough chit chat. Let's get this thing going. John, should we plan this out a little bit better? I don't know, it just.. We didn't plan the first one and it worked out well. Look, let's just upload this Russian Roulette scene, and we'll take it from there. And we're rolling. Alright, start the introduction. Do I have to? I'm not doing it. I'll do it. I meant I'm gonna start. I always do, why would that change now? Welcome, to the next episode of Truth or Dare, brought to you by, The Truth or Daredevils. So who's gonna get it this week? You know... A few of you guys mentioned that we didn't quite play Russian Roulette the right way. You can thank Tony for that. Shut up! You asked for it. So keep watching. Find out who's gonna get it next. Thank you, love. And, one in the chamber. And Tony's first. Uh, why don't you go, guy? Nope. Handle it. Fuck. That thing even on? I already told you its recording. Just man the fuck up. I fucking hate you guys. Now you go, big shot. Yeah, yeah. Stand back and watch. I'm not gonna waste as much airtime as you did. John! What the fuck was that?! What the fuck was that?! I'm so sorry! Fuck! Baby! What the fuck just happened?! What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck?! What did you do?! I didn't do anything! And it was supposed to be a blank. Tony, call an ambulance! Courtney, it's not gonna bring him back! Fuck! I don't know what happened! It was supposed to be a blank! Well it wasn't! I checked it before I put it in the bag, and then I checked it when I put it on the table, and then I - Oh, guys. You should have totally told me we were going to be wearing pajamas. I would have totally worn mine. I hate to waste tape. And Jennifer, I'm a little disappointed. You didn't wear the cute little pink jam-jams... The ones with the black polka dots. Those are my favorites! You don't know how excited I am to play with you guys! I've been waiting for this for so long. That's the psycho from earlier. The crazy audience member? What was that? Ray, I'm no longer an audience member. What the fuck are you then? I'm the new member of the Truth or Daredevils! Yes! Looks like John lost on round 1 of his turn already. I love what he's done with the place though. Let me get you guys settled, so we can carry on with the game. I'm gonna need everyone to sit on the ground, okay? Criss-cross apple sauce. Just like when we were kids. I don't want to. Ray! Right there, Ray. Ray's a tough guy. Jennifer, you can sit next to Ray. Michelle, you get to complete the circle. Right here. Courtney, I'm gonna need you to ziptie everyone's hands behind their backs. No, I can't. Courtney, did you want me to keep shooting John's corpse? No. Seems kind of silly, doesn't it? Courtney. What? Should we play the game? Yeah. That a girl! That's great. I've taken it upon myself. I've brought a list of our rules... And I'm gonna put em up here just so everyone can see them for reference. Okay? Like I was saying earlier. We're gonna play my version of the game. Which, it's pretty simple, really. I get to ask you all of the questions, which are of my choosing. It's fair if you think about it. What the fuck, dude? You killed John. I didn't pull the trigger, he did. That's some pretty fucked up logic you got there, buddy. Ray, perhaps you would like to sit this one out? Ah! Fuck! I know, I forget how loud that is. You didn't answer my question. It's okay though. I'll ask it again. Do you wanna play the game with us or not? Fine. I'll play. Ok. Good, good, good, good, good! If there's anyone else here that would like to not play, just tell me now. Okay good. Ah, ah! Courtney, since you're up, since John's done playing the game... Can you remove him from the player's circle? Come on. Okay. Good. Courtney, I'm gonna need you to, sit with the group. Sit with the team! Come on, let's play a game. Come on. Like I was saying, I get to ask the pivotal question, as well as the truth questions, and the dares themselves. You guys, of course, you guys get to choose between truth or dare. So, shall we carry on? Are you guys ready to play? Okay, a rule I'd like to bring to your attention, you guys... If I ask a group question, I expect a group answer. So, let me ask again; are we ready to play? Yes, yes, yes, yes. We're ready to play. Thank you. Okay. Now, when it's your turn. I'm gonna untie you. If you think about running, or causing a scene, you'll be shot. If anyone escapes, unfortunately, I'll be forced to terminate the game abruptly. What do you mean, terminate the game? As in, nobody in this room, will ever play again. If you try to run, nobody will have enough time to get back here to save anyone. This game, it doesn't belong to us anymore. It belongs to the fans. We're here because of them, the fans. You're fucking insane. Ray, if by insane, you mean I'm a passionate, hungry artist, then yes, yes I am. Tony, you're up. Fuck. But, but my turn was right before John's. Someone else should go. Truth or dare? Pick truth. Its gotta be the safe zone. Okay. I think it's Tony's prerogative. Okay, okay, truth. Truth. Thank you, Tony. Tony, what is the age of the youngest woman you've slept with? Um, it was Natalie. Back in high school. She was 16, I was 17. No. What you got there, buddy? Wait, wait, don't! Babe! What the fuck? What the fuck is your problem? I forgot to tell you guys. If you answer a truth question wrongly, you'll be penalized. Ow! You fucking psychopath! I told you the truth. Oh really? What about the tourist you were with like 17 days ago? Wait, what? I don't know what the fuck you're talking about! I know more than you think. Remember that. If you don't fess up, I'm gonna tell the whole group here and you'll be penalized. No. Her name is Amber, and... Ah! Okay! Okay! Fuck! Alright! Okay. Her, her name is Amber! Her name is Amber and I fucked her, okay? I fucked her! Alright? And she's only 13. And I didn't know, cause when I met her she said she was 15. She said she was 15! God, Tony. God! How the hell could you do this? She said she was 15. That's still illegal, you sick fuck! That's some shit, man. How do you even know this?! Ladies and gentlemen, Tony! Courtney, its your turn. Courtney, truth or dare? I don't want to play. Please, I don't want to play. Okay! Truth! Truth! Okay! This is a good one. Who was the last person you had sex with? It was John. What are you doing?! Don't touch her! Wait! Wait! Wait! Okay. See, we got a bunch of liars here and that's what you get for lying. I've known Courtney for years! She would never cheat on John, you creep! I wouldn't be so quick to judge, Jennifer. And my name's Derik. With a "k." She wasn't lying. Your rules don't make any sense! Rules, Jennifer. At least I have rules! Before I joined your group, your game, it lacked structure. It lacked realism. I'm bringing both those to the table and we're making the best videos yet! You should be thanking me. And besides, I don't hear any protests from Courtney. What? What is he talking about? I love Ray. I know you do. He's your brother. Ray. I need to know what the fuck is going on here, guys! You wouldn't understand. Try me! Well, if you loved him the way that I do, maybe you would know that... Courtney?! He's my boyfriend. What are you trying to say?! Ray and I made love. What? What? It's not what you think. Okay? It's not what you think. We were both really drunk, we were at a bar. Even if you're drunk, there has to be some sort of a fucking alarm... That goes off in your head that says screwing a family member is disgusting! As it turns out, they've been having a lot of sex. When? Oh, they've made love, 7 times in the last week. I'm sure they've been doing this since their childhood but I don't know. I've only been your number 1 fan for like, so long so I don't know, who knows? How could you? I love him. I've always loved him. And you guys thought I was the messed up one. This is great! We're in love. Oh god! All of you are fucked in the head. You just don't understand. We knew you wouldn't understand. I love how you guys play the game! Oh, this is so good! You're up next, Ray! Fuck you! I'm sorry. We're not related, so I don't think you'd be into that type of thing! I'm not playing your game, you freak. I refuse to. Oh, I'm the freak? That's funny. See, we are playing our game, and see here's the thing. It's your turn. And you have to play! Sorry I didn't make that more clear. Go ahead. Just shoot me. I dare you. Ray, it's not your turn to ask me a dare, my friend. But, if you don't mind having a bullet put in you? I'll keep that in mind for next round. Eenie, meenie, minie, moe. No! Please play! You need to play, please! Please, I need you to play! See Ray, I suspect that Courtney doesn't have the same affinity for being shot, as you. Do you, Courtney? No! Please! I already had my turn! I played your game, I did it the way you wanted to. You're not playing by your own rules! Well see, the thing is, Ray doesn't want to play so I had to make an addendum to the rules. Okay, wait, wait, wait! Ray, if you don't want to play, I'm gonna have to have Courtney sit out the rest of the game. Okay! I'll play! I'll play, you fuck! I'll play, I'll play! Okay, just don't hurt her. Ray, I love your spirit. Don't be doing anything stupid. Ray, truth or dare? Dare. Ray, I dare you, to eat this glass. Fuck that! I choose truth instead. Ray, you've already chose, you must complete the dare! Please, baby! Please, just do it, please just do it! Okay, okay, okay okay! I'll do it! I'll do it. Go ahead, Ray. Good job! That is the Truth or Daredevil spirit! Now Ray, please finish because Jennifer is anxiously awaiting her turn. Good job, buddy! I'm really starting to like you! Okay great! That was great, Ray! So now. Jennifer, if you don't mind... I'm gonna go ahead and upload our most current truth or dare video before we get to your turn. Okay, what's our team password for the video page? I don't know. What's our fucking password?! I don't know! I don't know! They never gave it to me because I don't; - It's "Irish Jigsaw!" Thank you, god get it together! You guys, you know what, you should really email me all of the vital team info. That way I can stay totally up to date on everything that's happening with the team. Like for instance, if we decide to incorporate costumes into our next video. God! It's going to be so exciting! There we go. Okay. I'm gonna let this upload while we continue with our game, alright? So I took the liberty of buying a second card so we can continue with this. That's gonna be a good shot. Jennifer, you look great. Jennifer, truth or dare? Truth. What age did you first have sex? Eleven. I was raped when I was eleven. That is true! Good girl! Don't look at me, Ray. Its not like I had a choice. Who did it? It doesn't matter. I'm, I'm sorry. I don't need your sympathy! I guess this game is completely rigged. This game isn't rigged, okay! Okay! Okay! Okay! When you were playing with your own rules, your game lacked integrity, okay? Okay. What I brought to the table, is integrity. This is going to be our most honest video, ever! Okay! All you have to do is play by the rules. This is serious, okay?! Okay! Act like it! If you have a stupid opinion, next time just shut the fuck up! Good job, Jen! At least somebody knows how to play the game. Alright, Michelle. Are we having fun guys? Michelle, truth or dare? Truth. When you were born, what was your full, legal name, Michelle? Michelle Jean Lucas. She answered your question, she told the truth! No, no, no, no! God! Don't! I told the truth! I told the truth! Baby. Michelle, you need to quit lying so much. There is no way that you know. Know what? It's called, truth or dare. How many people do I have to stab before you guys realize you have to stop lying? How the fuck, how the fuck do you know? When I said I was your biggest fan, and I knew everything about you guys, I meant it. I was, I was... my first... when I was born... I was... when I was born... My full name when I was born was Michael Gene Lucas! I don't get it. You heard me. Tony. She, she, she said Michael. Tony, when the two of you make love, do you always have to use lube? Well, yeah. Why do you think she can't naturally produce lubrication? Or is it that you just can't get her wet, big guy? Well she said she had a medical condition. Does she use birth control? Well no, but... Oh what the fuck? What the fuck?! God! You don't understand! I was supposed to be a girl! You're right, I don't understand because this shit ain't right! Fuck you! You fucking pedophile! That was one time! Fuck you! Fuck you. Oh yeah, Tony. Only one time! Yeah! What about the 14 year old last month? Or what is it you're expecting to do with this 11 year old that you've been chatting up recently online? God you people! Alright, I might have a problem. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Enough. We're losing some momentum here. We need to get on with our game. You guys, you really gotta stop lying to each other. That's no way to treat your teammates. So insensitive. Oh yes! It's my turn! Okay, for the time being, I'm not gonna record my turn. You know, we don't want to confuse our fans by just going ahead and putting me in the latest video. We're gonna wait until the official press release. Jennifer, why don't you ask the pivotal question? Truth or dare? I'm gonna go with truth! Figures. Quick, guys let's think of something he doesn't know the answer to! Why are you doing this? Dammit, Tony! God, that's a good question, Tony. Well, I think you already know the answer to that. You're a fucking moron, Tony. I need to know why the fuck he's doing this! Who the fuck cares why he's doing this, we need to get him... Hey, hey, hey, guys! I'm right here, I can hear everything you're saying, okay? It's my turn! Now, to answer Tony's truth question. As you guys know, I've always been your #1 fan, there's not a bigger fan than me. I've alway been your #1 fan. But now, now that I'm actually, I'm a member, I'm a real member of the Truth or Daredevils... We're all in the same group. Now that I'm a member, I'm here to bring the truth to the fans. The last video that you guys did, it was fake, it was fake, it wasn't even real. Nobody here was even playing. At least I'm showing how the game is supposed to be played, okay? The fans, they want to see reality. And that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna give the fans what they desire! And, you know what? Let's just go ahead, let's prove my point. Let's see how they're responding to the video. Oh here it comes! You guys, yes! Yes! This is going to be our biggest video yet! I mean... You guys. The fans! They're responding! They're responding! They like this video! Oh you guys, this is so exciting! We're gonna have so many views! The fans, they're responding to the realism. They appreciate the structure I brought to the game for sure, look, it says so right there! Oh... it's a good day! You guys, we are doing so good. And back to you, Tony. Truth or dare? Whatever one I pick is gonna fucking suck... dare. I dare you, to cut off your nipples. Really? I don't think you need me to repeat the instructions. Tony, it's like ripping off a bandaid. The quicker you go, the less painful it is. Cutting off your nipple, is nothing like ripping off a fucking bandaid, dude! I can't do this! Do it. Ah! Don't get any ideas. Just complete the dare. You remember the rules. What are; you don't need to stand! Derik, I can't do this. Please, can I, can I go, can I go with truth? I don't think you have any other alternative. Fuck! Fuck! This fucking sucks! Just do it! Ow! Ow! You're not getting the other one, you're not getting the other one, I can't do it. Tony, sorry but I'm not interested in doing anything halfway, alright? And you shouldn't be either! I can't! I can't! I'm sorry, I can't! You need to do both. It's not happening. No. Put the knife down. What? I said put the fucking knife down! Okay! I'm gonna tie you up, like your other teammates, okay? Oh, okay. Thank you, thank you, Derik. Oh, you're welcome. No it's my, it's my pleasure. I'm just gonna have to help you out on this one. No! No! No! No! Since you couldn't complete the dare, I'm gonna have to finish it for you. Remember now. Don't move. The less you move, the more likely I am to get just the nipple, okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. Here we go. Oh fuck! Oh! That was fun! I think this is a great time to upload our next clip, huh guys? We already have over 430,000 views! Yes! Woo! Let's go ahead and give ourselves a big round of applause for all of our hard work! Yes! Okay! What? I don't understand? I don't fucking understand! What the?! They think our video is another fake! How ignorant can they be? Do you actually believe our fans would think that we would hurt ourselves? That's what happens when you play the game for real. Of course nothing is going to happen when you don't put any fucking bullets in the chamber! Nobody plays Russian Roulette unless you're a POW, you fuck! I know all kinds of people that play these games without spreading the lies that your people spread! Lies? What lies? You fucking told lies! You know how I felt when I found out your last video wasn't real? What the fuck are you talking about? When I saw the onscreen, the perceived death that you guy did, I commended you. I mean, the fact that you guys were willing to risk your selves, to sacrifice yourselves for your art. It was great. What are you talking about? We just make Youtube videos. Just videos? Yeah. How can you call them "just videos?" I have every piece of merchandise of yours from your online store. Every newspaper clipping, every photo of you guys out in public. I have all of that. They're not just videos. They're an inspiration. Especially to me. You are one twisted fuck. And that says a lot coming from a guy like me. Why don't you get a life. Do something with yourself. Get a girl. Although, I doubt you could ever find anyone that would fuck you. You think that's funny? You think that's funny?! No, of course not. I'd watch the way you choose your fucking words! Remember who's choosing your fucking dares, okay? I know. Alright, good talk everyone... okay let's play! Okay, now back to Courtney. Courtney, truth or dare? You're just gonna stab me again if I choose truth, right? Dare. Dare! Okay. I've got a great one for you... Tony! What, what are you doing? What are you doing, man? Get up! Now, stand over there. Alright. Ow! No! Please! It's a bullet! No! Look, it's a bullet! No! Kiss it! No! Kiss it for luck! No! No! No! Please. Stand still. Okay. Okay, okay. Oh, this is going to be fun. Okay. Courtney, stand up. Stand up. There you go. Okay. Now Courtney, I'm gonna give you the gun, okay? Don't get any ideas. Now take the gun. I dare you to shoot that cup off Tony's head. Oh, fuck me! If you don't complete the dare though, you'll be the one with the bullet in your head. If I think you're intentionally trying to miss, we'll just keep shooting until you hit something. Got it? Oh, this is going to be fun! Courtney, back to you. Truth or dare? Dare. I dare you to shoot that cup off Tony's head. Oh fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Courtney, you can do this, okay. You can do this. I can't. Do it! Courtney just stay calm and aim the gun at the cup! You got this! You can do this! Use both of your hands! Okay, okay, okay. You gotta stand still! Quite moving around! I got fucking stabbed in the leg! Alright, aim it higher! You gotta aim it higher! Come on! You got this! Courtney! Okay, okay, okay! Right there! Guys I can't do it if you guys are; - let me focus! Courtney! You did it! You did it! Thank you! Thank you for not killing me. Well, that was sure anti-climatic! Sit down. Tony! Stay right there. Okay! Okay! Ray, truth or dare? Don't pick dare, dude! Dare. Why? God! What is wrong with you? I need you to stand up, Ray. Ray get up. Right here. Okay. Now it seemed a bit easy for Courtney, so; - Ray, I'm gonna change it up. Oh, fuck you! What the? That's not fair. Well Ray, I don't think it's up to you to decide what's fair or not, okay? Fuck. Remember, even though you're blindfolded, I've still got my gun on your head, okay? So no funny shit. Okay, Ray. No funny stuff, okay? Here's the gun. Okay. Ray? Truth or dare? Shit! Come on, Ray. Play the game! Dare! There you go, Ray. You know what to do. Shoot the cup off of his head. Derik, I can't do this. Don't. I really can't. I can't do it. Oh, yes you can. I can't do it again. Oh yes. I don't wanna do it. Please. You can. You can. Please! It's exciting! It's truth or dare! No, its not! Shit! Not there, Ray! You've gotta aim it higher! You're gonna shoot him in the head! Over to the left a little! Come on! You're gonna blow his freaking head off! What are you doing? Girls, you're gonna screw him up! Leave him alone! You want to live or don't you? Everybody shut the fuck up! Tony, you got the best sight on this. I want you to tell me where to aim. Okay, come on. You gotta at least; you're way off. Let me; at least try here. Alright Ray. Listen to me, buddy. We're gonna do this. Alright, here's what you gotta do. Okay. Just raise the gun, up a little higher. Now off to your right. Your other right. Okay, now down a little bit.

We're having trouble following your game because you keep changing the rules on us. Okay, Jennifer. I know it's a little hard to see the rules right now, but how about this? How about I just go ahead and eliminate everyone else from the game. And you can play by yourself. Well, let's see. Who should I start with first? Derik, this isn't fair. You want to talk about fair, Ray?! All I ever wanted to do, was have my own successful Youtube Channel. Well, as we know, it doesn't really work that way, does it?!
