Encoded by Type40 Label The history of man is defined by war. And war by the men who fight it. What if we could create a better man? Someone did. The Agent Program was initiated in August of 1967, by a man named Peter Aaron Litvenko. Its purpose was to create the perfect killing machine. Human beings without emotion or fear or remorse. The resulting subjects were called Agents. The program was a success. But the price of creating men without humanity was Litvenko's conscience. Applying his brilliant mind to his flight, he vanished. Fearing that it would be exposed, the government shut down the program. And surviving Agents drifted into shadows. Realizing its potential, many tried to restart the program. All failed. So they focused their efforts on finding the one man who could. The task fell to Dr. Albert Delriego. A ruthless and efficient man. But Litvenko had disappeared, and even he couldn't find him. Then, six years into his search, Delriego made an unexpected discovery. A single photograph, which would become the key to finding Litvenko. No one had ever imagined that, in the end, it would come down to one little girl. Sir, we have a match in Germany. Checking surveillance databases now, sir. Secure the files and evacuate. Sir, we need to leave now. What the hell is happening? I don't know, sir. I want to know who's doing this. I need answers. Give me an update. I said, give me an update! I said, status! I suppose I should be flattered. I didn't think I merited a contract. You don't. You know, I hunted an Agent once. Took four weeks. Most rewarding catch of my career. Your employers are attempting to restart the Agent Program. And you are here to stop them? You are too late. We already have Litvenko. He's currently working on next generation units. He's not. Because you haven't found him. Where is Katia van Dees? I have a chip implanted here. If my heart stops beating, my security detail will come through the door. You need me. No. I only need pieces of you. The information I require is in two places. Your secure database, and inside your head. Berlin, they found her in Berlin. That's all I know. Okay, Okay. File 5-1-7, access code G21-12-57. Thank you. But you won't find her. She's a ghost. I will. Yes? Delriego is dead. What happened? We think it may have been an Agent. Delriego was close to finding the girl. Get her before he does. He would have lived in Berlin between 1989 and 1990. There must be taxes paid or rental records or something. I don't have a name. Look, he would've been 49, 50, um... Blond-haired, 174 centimeters, 75 kilograms. He's like this. I'm sorry. Without a name or an address, there's nothing I can do for you. If he is missing, may I suggest you try the police? The police won't help me. Why do you think I'm here? And all you're doing is telling me what you cannot do. You have to realize that millions of people have lived in Berlin over the past 25 years. I can't be expected to sort through every one of them for your mystery man, can I? It's 19,467,000. 62.2% Slavic origin, 49.2% male. 1.2% between the ages of 49 to 50. That's 71,291. That's something, isn't it? There's nothing I can do to help you, miss. Okay. Who is he? This man you have to find. Who is he to you? I don't know. To or from? Everybody who comes in here is running. Either to something or from it. I see a lot like you. Runners. They come to me thinking a new passport means a new life. This is no good. It's perfect. The data strip's been demagnetized. The only place this gets me is a holding cell. You want better, you pay more. Or I put word out that Tobias sells bad paper. Be careful, little girl. This world is a dangerous place. 47, it's Diana. You have company. Who is he? A Syndicate asset. Name, unknown. Technical capacities, unknown. He found her. Means he's good. You're better. I'm sure you can handle him. You have 48 hours to terminate both targets. Sorry. You do know that stealing is a crime, don't you, Katia? That is your name, isn't it? Katia van Dees? My German's not... Are you some kind of cop? No. How do you know my name? I'm John. John Smith. I'd like to buy you a cup of coffee. I'm not interested. How about in living? Are you interested in that? Walk away or I'll scream. He won't care. He's here to kill you, Katia. And I'm here to stop him. I know you don't have any reason to trust me but look at him. Look at how he moves. Look at the shadows under his coat. Look at his eyes and tell me that I'm lying. Why would anyone want to kill me? For the same reason you're trying to look for someone you can't find. The man I'm looking for, do you know where he is? No, but you do. What do I have to do? There's a maintenance door, the north end of the track, one level down. It's been unlocked for us. We're gonna head there now. Go through the corridor up the stairs to the back alley. There'll be a car waiting for us there. Run! Move. Franco, we're coming your way. Hurry! Hurry! Where's the Agent? He's right behind us! Move! Move! Move! Katia, are you hit? Who the fuck are you people? Calm down, Katia! You're safe. We've been sent to protect... I work for a corporation called Syndicate International, and I'm here to protect you. From who? His name is 47, and he's an Agent. And right now the only thing standing between you and him, is me. If you don't do everything I say, everything, he will kill you. Let's go! We'll be safe here. Can I see some ID, please? Bags out and open, please. Drop your weapon! On the ground! Hands where I can seem 'em! - Don't move! - Get them cuffed! Come on with me. Let's go. Grab that bag. Let's go! Miss van Dees, is it? You mind telling me why you're here? 'Cause your friend in there wouldn't talk. He's not my friend. I don't know who he is. All right. Maybe we can start with why he discharged a firearm in front of my embassy. Someone's trying... I think someone's trying to kill me. John was trying to help me. Does this someone have a name? Is something wrong, Miss van Dees? Miss van Dees! He's coming. Shit. Freeze! Hands in the air! Sanders. Blaser R93 LRS2. Custom configured right-hand twist. 4-24x50 sniper scope, and... ...hair trigger. Very nice. Come here. Almost as nice as the twin .45s, and these very special knives you walked in here with. You like riddles? Yeah, me neither. I hate 'em, actually. But you, my friend, are a riddle to me. 'Cause I've run your face and your prints through every database we have. And you know what we found? Nothing. So why don't we start with your name? 47. That's not a name. No, but it is mine. Okay. All right, Mr. 47. What exactly are you? An assassin. An assassin. Okay. You're here to kill who exactly? You have a girl here. I don't know what you're talking about. Do you love your family? My family? Yes, your wife, your two small children. Do you love them? We're not talking about me, we're talking about you. No, we're talking about life. And death. Do you love them? All right. Maybe we should just start over. I believe you do. That's why you should let me go. You listen to me very carefully, Mr. 47, or whatever the fuck your name is. There's a lot of ways this thing can end, and that is entirely up to you. But you can be goddamn certain that this thing is not gonna end the way that you thought it was. 'Cause the last time I checked, you're locked in here with me, and I'm the one with the gun. No, Mr. Sanders. You are locked in here with me, and you just brought me mine. Do you love your children enough to die for them? Freeze! Let's go. Let me help you. Two suspects, one male, one female, have broken out of Interrogation Rooms 1 and 2. They are armed and dangerous. Proceed with caution. Sergeant. Is everything all right, sir? Sir? Hurry! Hurry! Get out! Move! You want to tell me what's happening now? What the fuck is happening? The man you're looking for, his name is Peter Aaron Litvenko. Who is he? Your father. Tell me about him. I don't know much. Only that he's a geneticist, an expert in human biogenetics who spearheaded a program of experimentation. What kind of experiments? The kind that created killers. They engineered human beings by targeting and enhancing specific genes. The resulting subjects were stronger, faster, more intelligent than normal people. They programmed out pain, fear. Even love. They were called Agents. And your father was one of the program's lead scientists. You're not serious. What does any of this have to do with me? Why do they want to kill me? Kryton Technologies has restarted the Agent Program. They're building Agents right now. Like 47, maybe worse. They believe that you're the key to finding your father. I don't understand. Your father knows their weakness. He knows how to stop them. Katia! Are you okay? No. Is your name really John Smith? It's Brian. Well, at least you didn't say it was Agent 46. No, that's someone else. Come here. Let me help you. You're gonna be all right. Will I? I'm sorry. For what? For having to tell you who your father is. Well, you told me the truth. That's more than anyone's ever done for me. Why do they think I can find him, John? It doesn't matter now. It does. Tell me what you know. I know that you're in danger. The best thing you can do right now is hide. I've been hiding my entire life. Please, tell me what you know. I'm authorized to protect you, Katia, not find your father. Don't do this. I have to. Okay. When we were researching your father, we found a file. It mentioned you. It said that... Said What? It said that he changed you. Changed me how? It said that he had enhanced your survival skills. It's why we think you've been hiding. It's why we think you've been able to keep off the radar. It's why we think you've been able to stay alive for so long. That's why I'm always afraid. Yes. Jesus! They think I know how to find my father. What is this? It's my father's life. What else do you know about him? Just what I've told you. You must have something. How old is he? 72. Where was he born? Ukraine. Medical conditions? He was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in his 40s. Somewhere warm, then. What else? Lung cancer. Our last confirmed sighting was a hospital in Seoul, South Korea in 2011. He was engaged with some clinical trials for something called nanoparticle inhalation therapy. He was Stage III then. So, uh, travel would be difficult. Does he have money? We think so. Somewhere warm with advanced medical facilities. A city. Hobbies? What did he love to do? Orchids. He was an expert on orchids. What languages did he speak, John? Uh, English, Russian, Mandarin and Tamil. Why Tamil? Because your mother was from Sri Lanka. You know where he is, don't you? Katia. You told me you wanted to do this, and I told you I'd do it with you. But if you want my help, you have to tell me where he is. We've lost the girl. I thought you told me that your John Smith would be adequate. We underestimated this Agent. Find Litvenko, whatever it takes. And Garad, better the girl dead than this Agent finding Litvenko before we do. Katia. Katia. Do you know why you're still alive? Because I chose not to kill you. But they will. After they use you to find your father. What do you know about my father? As much as you do. It's gonna be okay. No! Time to make a choice, Katia. Them or me. Why should I trust you? You don't have to. Just trust your memories. Take my hand. Do you remember the day you ran away, Katia? Peter, we have to go! Your father's lab? The car rides? It's okay. The last time you saw your mother? No! No, no, no! You were there. Yes. We were part of the same program. We need to go. Quick! Run! Quick! Now, get down. Get down, please! Papa! You will live. He left me. Why? Find him. You can ask him yourself. Untie me. You have a lot to learn, Katia. We don't have a lot of time. Untie yourself. That took you too long. I didn't know that was a test. Everything is a test. Keep taking these, you'll fail. Hey, I need those. What you need is a clear head. Stop fighting what you are. And what am I? Keep asking questions, probably dead. What am I? You're the same as me, only better. Bullshit! I'm just Katia van Dees. You speak French, Spanish, Mandarin. Where did you learn them? How did you free yourself from the rope? You've been programmed. And your name isn't Katia van Dees. It's "Quatre-vingt-dix." French for "90." So I'm 43 versions better than you? Do they know? If they knew, you'd be the target. Come on, let's go. If you need my help to find my father, why did you shoot me? I didn't shoot you, I marked you. There are so many. If I shoot one, the rest will converge. So what do we do, Katia? Avoid them. No. Suppress your fear, face the threat. Your father programmed you to see and hear everything at extremely heightened levels. You process that information to anticipate the threat. So, anticipate it. Katia. There. Area Four, all... Katia. Now. I need you to step out there. Why? To draw them toward you. They're going to shoot me! They're not gonna shoot you. Do you want to see your father again? Trust me. I have a visual target, locked. Moving in. Hello, Katia. I'm only going to ask you once. Where is your father? I want you to know, I'm a big fan of your work, 47. It's an honor to meet a legend. I thought you could only be a legend after you were dead. Oh, but you are. You just don't know it yet. I feel pretty good for a dead man, John. Almost as good as you. Yeah? Well, the thing is, I'm special. Let's see. Pretty crazy, huh? I'm better. Say it. Say it! You're not. You missed. No, she didn't. He made a mistake. He had a gun at your head. And he didn't pull the trigger. He wanted me to know he'd beaten me. What the fuck was he? People don't just walk away from four bullets. They just don't. Subdermal titanium body armor. It's injected into the skin in liquid form. It's flexible and extremely strong. He had his nervous system heightened. Wired for speed. I've heard of these Syndicate experiments... but if they can do this with him... Now will you tell me where Litvenko is? Swear to me that you're not gonna hurt him. Swear it. All right, I swear it. Diana, did you hear that? I did. Send me a link to the asset. If you lie to me, I will kill you. I'm not that easy to kill. He's in Singapore. The Syndicate headquarters are in Singapore. He's hiding in plain sight. Yes? It's Diana. I need you in Singapore as soon as possible. I'm on my way. Yes? Litvenko's in Singapore. They're on their way. They're coming. Scan every entry point. Yes, sir. The Syndicate's tied to those cameras, isn't it? They're tied to everything. Can you hold this, please? Thank you. How do you fight against that? By playing the odds, doing the unexpected. Take nothing for granted. Everything you do has a reason. What does that mean? Jacket. Give me your bag. Right now, it means avoid those cameras. Okay. I know, that took me too long. Ask you a question? Am I going to end up like you? Bombs? Moths. It's Italian wool, they love it. Did it hurt? Yes. Do you all...? The barcode is given to us when we're born. And the number? When we become Agents. He'll be there in the morning about 9:00. It's when the orchids are in full bloom. You know he's dying. Lung cancer. He has to use an inhaler now to breathe. Are you human? It's just that John said that you're not capable of fear or remorse. They've been suppressed. Is that true? Yes. What about love? I am what I need to be. What does that mean? It means that, in this job, sometimes it's better not to feel anything. I'm not talking about the job. I think you're lying. I don't believe you can just turn off fear or love. I don't believe anyone can. I mean, you're either a person or you're something else. Which is it? Are you asking me or yourself? You can't fight who you are, Katia. You'll lose. Is that what happened to you? You fought what you were and you lost? People can change. Don't put your faith in me. You'll be disappointed. I still have a job to do. Which is? Right now, I need to sleep. When I get anxious and I can't sleep, I take things apart. I'm sorry. Don't ever do that again. Were they Syndicate? No, freelance. Friends of yours? So, the Syndicate doesn't know we're here? There's an open contract out on us. What do you think? Here. Try not to take this apart. She smells funny. Robert, please! How did they find us so quickly? You tell me. No games. What makes you think this is a game? The cameras in the terminal didn't see me. But the one outside, near the exit, did. Getting pretty good at this, aren't I? No, you're sloppy. I'm gonna have an attack. Be a good boy. Here, take your inhaler. It'll be all right. Excuse me. - Where did you get that? - I traded it. For what? Your knife. Bring Litvenko and the girl to me. You shouldn't have come. You know who I am? You are your mother's daughter. Why did you leave me? I wanted you to have no part of what I was. I wanted you to live. You had no right. To walk away from you? To turn me into this isolated, afraid thing that I am. You had no right. Walk with me, Katia. I loved your mother very much. She was a light in a very dark world. And more than anything else, she wanted a child. But she was unable. So we broke every rule we had, and we made you. We knew that if you were discovered, they would take you from us. So we gave you the tools to be free. This isn't freedom. No, perhaps not, Katia. But it is necessary for your survival. Now, I don't expect you to understand... but I do ask that you find it in yourself... to forgive an old man his selfishness. And if I can't? You will, because you are the reflection of the woman I loved. I'm ready. Get it over with. Do it now. He's not going to kill you. Father. Yes, he will. It's inevitable. Killing is what he is programmed to do and who he is. Isn't that right, 47? You're wrong. We determine who we are by what we do. You believe... you have a choice? I believe that's what makes us human. Then it seems... that you and your brother have a lot to teach this old man. I guess I gave you a family after all. Move! Gotcha. Seal the building. Go! What do they want? More of me. Why would anyone want more of you? One and two, stay on him. Three and four, cut him off. Cut him off. They're boxed in. They've got nowhere to go. Right or left, Katia? Straight ahead. Trust me. Holy shit! I want this building sealed! Perhaps you should consider shooting him. Subdermal body armor. What, they actually got that to work? Yep. Drive the fucking car faster! Faster! Faster! We're not gonna make it. Trust me. I want all units on station. We take them in the city. This is never going to end, is it? I'm afraid not. He will never stop. Who? Antoine Le Clerq. The Syndicate's chairman. What if we killed this Le Clerq? Would it end then? You can't. Maybe not, but you can. Nobody ever gets close enough to Le Clerq to kill him. He never leaves his protected office. Nobody ever goes in. He's surrounded at all times by security. 14. That's how many Agents have tried. All are dead. Help me! Help me! - Get up! - I can't walk! Come on, you can do it! Get up. - Sorry. - I can help. Take her away from me! You've got to! Come on! Take her! Please! Come on! Please! Get her out of here! No! No! Take her! Hello, Doctor. What the fuck did you just do? We need to go back! He was all I had. I have to help him. You can't. God, you emotionless piece of shit! I should kill you. Yes, you should. But you won't, because you're weak. You're nothing more than a scared little girl whose only real gift... is running. Fuck you. DNA sequences, Doctor? Adaptive mutation bacteriophages. Epistasis rates, transfer RNA? Come on, Doc. I don't want to do this. Believe me, you don't want me to do this either. So tell me what I need to know. Tell me... how to make an Agent. This shit's experimental, Doc. I've seen it work... and believe me when I tell you you don't wanna be the one it's working on. You're a bastard. I know. No. You don't. You're a result of inferior technologies. A failed experiment. An Agent's advantage is not his body, John Smith. It's his mind. You will never be as good as him. Cook him. For fuck's sake, Doctor, give me what I need. Shit. Mr. Chairman. Are you all right? No, I'm not. I need the Chairman's detail. The Chairman is out. 995. Emergency Services, please. Can I have your location, please? Dose him again. It could kill him. Do it. Oh, fuck it! That's quite enough, John. You can wait outside. All of you. It's okay, John. Petya. Can you hear me? I'm going to be completely honest with you. I admire you. You've created something unique. A better human being, and I want it. I've bet my wealth, my company, my reputation... everything, on the success of this program, you understand. Good thing I sold your stock, then. You and I aren't so very different. You know this. Oh, you're wrong. People can change. No. Not people like us. What you did... when you chose to play God can never be undone. You can't run from what you are. So, I should... embrace it? Restart the program with you at its head? Yes. You always were a small man, Antoine. A derivative thinker, at best. This desperation, it suits you. The key to everything... is in your mind, and you're going to give it to me. Tell me how to build an Agent. You don't want an Agent. Then what do I want? An army. And I won't give it to you. Then you're going to die. I'm already dead. Yes, but what about your daughter? You don't have her. Oh, but I will. Eventually. Give me what I want, and I'll leave her in peace. I give you what you want, there will be no peace. Mr. Chairman. Where is he? How did he get into our system? I don't know, Mr. Chairman. I'm assuming by your reaction that you know who I am. What do you want? To make a deal. You have nothing I need. You're wrong. You want what's inside Litvenko's head... but he won't give it to you. I can. How? Window. You want the next generation of Agents. .. But you've been looking in the wrong place. You thought the girl was merely a way to find Litvenko. A means to an end. Truth is... she is the end. That's right. Everything you need... the strength... the speed, the intelligence, is right there. ...locked inside her DNA. So you want to trade him for her? Why? Because I always close my contracts. Fuck you. There's a helipad on the roof. Get him someplace secure. Heading back to the safe room. I want all teams to floor 40. It's not gonna be enough, John. No. You stay with me, you protect me! So many choices. And only one right answer. What's it gonna be? Emotion or duty? It was too quick. Fire was here too quick. Someone called them before the crash. What does that mean? It means he was never on that helicopter. Get them out. What was your mistake? I don't make mistakes. You needed me to know you were better than me. Where is he? On the roof. When this is done, I will kill you. Ahhh! Your mother would be proud. What? Nothing. I doubt you'd understand. It doesn't matter. We'll find her. I believe you will. Confirm target termination. Target: Le Clerq, Antoine... terminated. And the other? Second target? 47? Le Clerq. He was your target the whole time? Everything you taught me was just so you could have a diversion. It was necessary. What, to kill a single man? No. To put a stop to the Agent Program once and for all. And to set you free. Your father loved you, Katia. He understood that Le Clerq would not rest once he knew who you were. That he would hunt you down. So he did what any parent would. He died to save his children. This is your mission, isn't it? We determine who we are by what we do. There is a building full of highly trained operatives... who will be on their way up here, now. You're wrong. There's just one.
