(slow orchestral music) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) I guess most folks remember a time in their life that made all the difference. I know I do. I was only 10 years old at the time and I can remember it as if it were yesterday. The year was 1851 when my father took me down the Rogue River, the wildest, most beautiful river you ever saw. (slow music) My father was Big Eli McDonaugh and he was a lot like that river. He always flowed with the endless current, always moving, always curious as to what lay around the next bend. Big Eli was a special breed of man and I wanted to grow up to be just like him. (slow music continues) He was a cartographer, a map maker as we know it, hired by the Army Corps of Engineers to explore and map out the great northwest. Nobody except the Indians of that area knew the country better than my father. It was a beautiful country, most of it still untouched by man's destructive hand. (slow music continues) (bird chirps) (slow music continues) Look at that, son. Oh, yeah, look at that. (birds chirping) (birds continue chirping) (gun fires) What'd you do that for? Why don't you just leave those animals alone? Mind your own business. You know, there's two things I don't like about you, Weasel. What? They're both your face. Both? Well, just 'cause you're a big map maker don't mean you're better than I am. Why don't you just go take care of your pig? Yeah. It's okay, son. (slow music) Look, Pa, an eagle. (eagle screeches) It's a golden, all right, son. Is it Lady? No, this is a little too far to Lady's territory. I can't wait to meet her, Pa. (Big Eli laughs) Well, it won't be long now. My mother died of consumption the year before and I'd been sent to St. Louis to stay with my Aunt Jesse. She and St. Louis were supposed to civilize me, which mostly meant you wore a shirt that pinched your neck and shoes that pinched your toes. Well, after what seemed to be the longest year of my life, Pa finally came and got me. Oh, it sure felt good to be with him again. (river gushes) (pig squeals) My grandma's always late, but she's old. (Frenchy grunts) (dish clatters) Hatchett, guess who I come down the river with? (pig squeals) Well, let's see what you brung me, Frenchy. (Frenchy speaking in foreign language) Two chickens, 20 pelts. Fine plews. One barrel of whiskey, 75 pelts. Who is that man, Pa? He's just a man I used to know, son. These pelts are the finest in the northwest. Two chickens, aye. (chickens clucking) Two barrels of hardtack, one barrel of salt pork, 75 pelts. (Frenchy speaking in foreign language) Well, that's about it, Frenchy. We'll see you next spring, your rum and salt pork, you know? (Frenchy speaking in foreign language) Big Eli, you owe me an eye! Who was that man, Pa? His name's Hatchett, son. I caught him raiding trap lines a few years back, and he and I got in a fight and he lost an eye. It sure felt better after we'd put some distance between us and those river pirates. Our French Canadian boatmen, Frenchy and Pierre, couldn't be too fussy about who they did business with. Business was where you found it. And the selling and trading of those precious furs could make men act in a very unpredictable way. Some folks you had to deal with were, well, let's just say less than honorable. It was two days before we reached our destination, and although I'd enjoyed our journey down the river, I could hardly wait to see our new home. Thanks for the ride, Frenchy and Pierre. (Frenchy speaking in foreign language) You're still the best river man west of the Rockies, Frenchy. (Frenchy grunts) Thank you. (Frenchy speaking in foreign language) Thanks, Pierre. (Pierre speaking in foreign language) Watch your step, son. Au revoir, Frenchy. Au revoir, Pierre, I'll see you next spring. (Frenchy speaking in foreign language) (Pierre speaking in foreign language) (Frenchy speaking in foreign language) (slow music) Come on, son. (slow orchestral music) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (eagle screeches) Is that her, Pa? That's Lady, son, that's her, all right. (eagle screeches) Is that for Lady? Yeah, it is, son, I gotta use this now that she's gotten big. She doesn't realize how strong she is and she could hurt my arm without even knowing it. Let's see if we can call her down here. (whistle tweets) (upbeat orchestral music) (eagle screeches) (upbeat orchestral music continues) (upbeat orchestral music continues) (upbeat orchestral music continues) (eagle screeches) Come on, girl. (eagle screeches) Come on, girl. Here she comes, son. (eagle screeches) (eagle chirps) Hi, Lady, I'm Little Eli. Well, hi, girl, how are you? Did you miss me? Well, I missed you, too, I sure did. She sure is beautiful. She flies the highest, son. Where'd you find her? Got her about a mile from here up the canyon last year. Some mountain men came through and shot her mom. By the time I got to her, she was just about half dead. Your own eagle, boy, you sure are lucky. (Big Eli laughs) I guess I am. I taught Lady how to hunt and fly, and she shows me where the game is and we share what we catch, kind of like a family would do, like you and me. Well, off you go, Lady. (eagle chirps) (eagle screeches) Isn't she pretty? Can I try calling her? Well, let's get on up to the cabin. I'll teach you later. (birds chirping) (birds continue chirping) (birds continue chirping) (slow music) We're home, Eli. It's beautiful! (slow music continues) Yippee! (Big Eli laughs) (slow music continues) It's beautiful. You open that window over there. We get a little light and it'll be a lot prettier. (slow music continues) Come on, that's better. What do you think? (raccoon chirps) Uh-oh, we've got company. (Big Eli laughs) How'd you get in here? What'd you do? Oh, you're gonna try and get away from me, are you? What'd you do, come through the window, yeah? You gonna say hi to Eli? Say hi to Eli. Cute little guy, isn't he? Okay, little guy, that's a good boy. (laughs) (slow music continues) (Little Eli laughs) Pa, you know that boy raccoon? I don't think it was a boy. (raccoon chirps) (Big Eli laughs) (slow music continues) Pa certainly had a special way with animals. He communicated with them like no other person I've seen or met since. They seemed to respond to his touch, his very presence. He tried to teach me their ways and share the special gift that he had. I did my best to learn all that I could from him, and I learned a lot. But some of the lessons being taught were easier to take than others. (slow music continues) (slow music continues) That looks real nice, son. It's a good day's work. I sure like us being together again. Oh, I do too, Eli, I really do. But how come you sent me away to Aunt Jesse's when Ma died? Well, I reckon I just needed a little time by myself, a little time to think and, well, build us a cabin. I could have helped you build a cabin. I'm strong enough. (Big Eli laughs) Well, that you are, you've gotten to be a real big boy. You've even put a little meat on those bones since you've been gone. (eagle screeches) Is that Lady? That's her, let's go down to meet her. (birds chirping) (whistle tweets) (eagle screeches) (eagle chirps) (wind whistles) (birds chirping) (birds continue chirping) (eagle screeches) (birds chirping) (eagle chirps) Boy, I wish I could ride the wind like that, son. (eagle chirps) You know what we gotta do? We gotta build Lady a perch to keep her off the ground. All right. Well, that looks good, doesn't it? I'll put this rock in here. You ever think about Ma? Yeah, Eli, I think about your ma all the time. See that big white puffy cloud up there, son? Well, I bet your ma is laying on it right now, looking down on both of us, being real proud, and watching you grow up to being a fine young man. You know, son, if you look real hard, I'll bet you could see your ma's bright blue eyes looking down on you. (slow orchestral music) I love you, son. (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (no audio) (no audio) (no audio) Can I learn about map making? You can learn about anything you want to, Eli. But you know what? Hmm? You could learn a lot more if you just go over there and open up those books you brought. Ugh, Pa. Don't you "Ugh, Pa" me. Pa, I'm gonna be a boatman anyways. Boatmen don't need no book learning. (Big Eli laughs) Well, you know, you're gonna be the smartest boatman that ever sailed this river. (Big Eli laughs) (Hatchett speaking in foreign language) You have furs you would like to trade? Do you like these beads? They don't like these beads. Whiskey, whiskey is good. This is the finest. They don't want any whiskey. Some fine lace ribbon for your lady? (Hatchett laughs) Oh, I know what you want. The tomahawk. Yes, yes, come forward. Come into my camp, be welcome, sit. Jake, would you mind going down below and fetching us some of heaven's sweet rain? Huh? Jake, go down and get us some water, would you, please? And make sure your pistol is loaded. (Jake grunts) Yes, fine. (Hatchett speaking in foreign language) Would you like to hold it? Feel it. Yeah. I will trade you that magnificent tomahawk for these insignificant pelts. No? But maybe we could trade fire for fur? (guns firing) (eagle screeches) Is that Lady? Well, that's her, son. Can I try calling her? Sure you can. Just nice and easy. (whistle tweets) All right. (whistle tweets) That's my boy. (eagle screeches) There she is. (eagle chirps) (eagle continues chirping) It looks like she's taken a liking to you, son. I hope so. I'm gonna be gone most of the day mapping the Rogue River, son. Can I go? No, not this time. The salmon are starting to run. I need you to catch as many as you can so we can fill up that smokehouse. I can keep up. Well, one day soon you and I will both walk the same speed. I can keep up. I sure wish you'd stay here and catch those salmon for us. I made you something, a pair of pants. Now you can get rid of those city pants. Thanks, Pa. I made you a bracelet, I hope you like it. Thanks. You take care of the cabin. I'll be back before you know it. (door creaks) (eagle screeches) You keep an eye out for my boy, Lady. (birds chirping) (door creaks) (birds chirping) (birds continue chirping) (footsteps crunching) (twig snaps) (footsteps crunching) (footsteps continue crunching) (birds cawing) (footsteps crunching) (footsteps continue crunching) (footsteps continue crunching) (slow music) (slow music continues) (slow music continues) (slow music continues) (water splashes) (man grunts) (eagle screeches) (birds chirping) (birds continue chirping) (birds continue chirping) (birds continue chirping) (birds continue chirping) (eagle screeches) Hello, Lady, how's my girl? (eagle screeches) (eagle chirps) What's a matter with you, Lady? Huh, what's wrong? Is it Eli, huh? Is something wrong with Eli? (eagle screeches) Okay. (eagle screeches) (birds chirping) (birds continue chirping) (door creaks) Eli? (birds chirping) Eli! Eli? (footsteps crunching) (footsteps continue crunching) Eli? (footsteps crunching) (river trickles) (river continues trickling) Eli! Eli! (slow dramatic music) (Big Eli sighs) (slow music) (slow music continues) (rifle clicks) (slow music continues) (slow music continues) (slow orchestral music) Let's go get Eli, Lady. (eagle screeches) (slow orchestral music continues) (eagle screeches) (eagle chirps) Go find him, Lady, go find him, go find him. (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (eagle chirps) (slow orchestral music continues) (eagle chirps) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (eagle screeches) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (dog barks) (horse whinnies) (children laughing) (horse whinnies) Eli. (men speaking in foreign language) (slow drumming music) (slow drumming music continues) (slow drumming music continues) (slow drumming music continues) (slow drumming music continues) (slow drumming music continues) (slow drumming music continues) (slow drumming music continues) (Little Eli cries out) It's okay, son, it's okay. That man bought me from the one-eyed man and the man on the raft. He bought you? By our law, the boy belongs to me. I paid for him. The boy is mine. I paid two fine horses for him. Do you have two fine horses? The boy belongs to me. You wear the silver, is it a warrior's bracelet like mine? Yes. Then honor me as a warrior. (slow music) (slow music continues) (horse whinnies) When the spear lands, the challenge begins. (birds chirping) (people shouting) Go, go, Pa! (people shouting) (Running Wolf grunts) Go, Pa, go! (people shouting) (Big Eli grunts) (people shouting) (Running Wolf grunts) (Big Eli yells) (Big Eli panting) (Running Wolf panting) (horse whinnies) You won, Pa, you won! We did, son. (eagle chirps) Lady, he won, he won. You are the one they call Golden Eagle. You do not remember me. I was a small girl when my grandfather gave you this. You are Silver Cloud's granddaughter? He gave you that eagle cry in the year of the falling moon. He thought you were a worthy child of the great eagle. He taught you the ways of an eagle keeper. Your grandfather was a very wise medicine man. He taught me many things. He taught me how to live with Mother Earth. (children laughing) You may stay in our lodge. The boy and you are welcome here. My boy and I thank you. You remember my grandmother Hoches? It's an honor to see you again, Hoches. May I be seated? Thank you. May I be seated? We are honored by your presence. You may stay as long as you wish. I must leave with the rise of the sun. To search for the man with one eye? Hoches, your husband Silver Cloud and I were very good friends, and out of his respect, I'd like to ask a favor of you, if you would watch my son Little Eli until I return. The boy will be safe with us. No harm will come to him. Thank you. I wanted to go with you, Pa. I want you to stay here 'til I come back. You'll be safe. (fire crackles) (fire continues crackling) (fire continues crackling) (horse whinnies) (fire crackles) (fire continues crackling) (fire continues crackling) (fire continues crackling) (dog barks) (dog continues barking) (eagle screeches) (eagle screeches) Dang bird, I'll get you, I'll get you. (gun fires) Missed. (eagle screeches) Well, get away, then, get away from me, go on! Well. (pants) Bird. (grunts) (canoe rattles) (water splashes) Big Eli! Where? He's following us. How do you know? It's that damn golden eagle of his. It was following me down the river. That could have been any damn eagle. Well, it was his eagle, I know, and took a shot at it and missed. What are we gonna do? Pack it up, we got work to do. Big Eli, you're gonna die. (horse whinnies) You did that on purpose! (children laughing) Quit laughing at my shoes! (children laughing) (Little Eli grunts) (children grunting) (child speaking in foreign language) (Watawna speaking in foreign language) (horse snorts) (sticks rustling) (river trickles) (river continues trickling) (eagle screeches) (rifle clicks) (eagle screeches) (gun fires) (Big Eli cries out) (water splashes) (eagle screeches) (Big Eli moans) (Big Eli panting) Go down there and see if he's dead. I always have to go. Why don't you send the fool? (Jake laughs) Get on down there. I'm going. (Jake laughs) Hey! (Big Eli groans) (waterfall splashes) (waterfall continues splashing) (waterfall continues splashing) (rifle clicks) (waterfall splashes) (waterfall continues splashing) (waterfall continues splashing) (waterfall continues splashing) He ain't here. Y'all have to come help me find him. Damn, fool never could do anything right. (waterfall splashes) (waterfall continues splashing) (waterfall continues splashing) (waterfall continues splashing) (waterfall continues splashing) Weasel! Weasel, where are you? Weasel? (waterfall splashes) (waterfall continues splashing) (waterfall continues splashing) (Big Eli groans) (Big Eli panting) (waterfall splashes) Did you see anything, Weasel? I didn't see nothing. You have two good eyes. You didn't see anything? Well, maybe his body washed down the stream, on maybe it's stuck on the bottom of the- Shh. What do we do now? Leave him. (Big Eli panting) (Big Eli cries out) (Big Eli groans) (waterfall splashes) (waterfall continues splashing) (waterfall continues splashing) (Big Eli panting) (Big Eli grunts) (eagle screeches) (Big Eli panting) (waterfall splashes) (eagle screeches) (eagle chirps) (Big Eli groans) (waterfall splashes) (Big Eli panting) (horse whinnies) Why don't you play with the others? Don't feel much like playing. Your father will return when he can, no matter how long you stare at that horizon. Just wish he would have took me with him. He always leaves me behind. His journey is very dangerous and you are a little boy. I am not a little boy. I have made these for you. Thank you. (slow music) (Big Eli moans) (waterfall splashes) (Big Eli panting) (whistle tweets) (eagle screeches) (eagle chirps) (eagle chirps) (eagle chirps) Go find Little Eli, Lady. (eagle chirps) Lady, go find Little Eli. Go find Little Eli. Go find Little Eli, Lady. (eagle chirps) (Big Eli panting) (upbeat orchestral music) (eagle chirps) (eagle screeches) (upbeat orchestral music continues) (upbeat orchestral music continues) (eagle screeches) (eagle chirps) It's Lady! Pa must be in trouble. Lady tells you this? Yeah. We must go then, get my horse. (slow orchestral music) (eagle chirps) (eagle screeches) (horse whinnies) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (eagle screeches) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow music) (horse whinnies) (eagle screeches) There she is! (slow orchestral music) (slow orchestral music continues) (eagle screeches) There! (slow orchestral music continues) (eagle chirps) Pa! Pa, wake up, Pa! It's me. He has been shot. Hello, son, I dropped my rifle up on the ridge, boy. I'll go get it. We can find it later, we must leave here. Get my hatchet, find three long poles, hurry, go! (no audio) (no audio) (Big Eli gasps) (Watawna sighs) (Big Eli panting) (eagle chirps) (Big Eli groans) (eagle chirps) (slow orchestral music) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (Big Eli sighs) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (eagle chirps) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (no audio) (no audio) (no audio) (no audio) (no audio) (horse whinnies) (slow orchestral music) (horse whinnies) (slow orchestral music continues) (horse whinnies) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) It's all right, Pa. (Big Eli moans) We just gotta hide for a while. (slow orchestral music continues) (rifle clicks) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (Watawna gasps) I thought you might need my help. (eagle screeches) (no audio) (baby cries) (no audio) (no audio) (horse whinnies) Pa, Pa, we're here, you're gonna be okay. Thanks, boy. (fire crackles) (medicine man speaking in foreign language) (medicine man continues speaking in foreign language) (medicine man continues speaking in foreign language) (medicine man continues speaking in foreign language) (medicine man continues speaking in foreign language) (fire crackles) (medicine man speaking in foreign language) Watawna and I kept vigil over Pa and did what we could. We were afraid he was on the verge of leaving us. He drifted into a dark, distant place, traveling to some other world, a world uncharted by the living. (slow orchestral music) (eagle screeches) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (eagle screeches) (slow orchestral music continues) (Big Eli moans) Eli, let him feel the sun. (Big Eli moans) (Big Eli panting) (Big Eli sighs) (Big Eli sighs) While we waited for Pa to choose between this life and the next, Lady waited high up on the nearby tree and never left her perch. It was like part of her was in the teepee next to Pa, and I knew that if he left us, Lady would most likely do the same. Pa, Pa. Hello, Eli. Pa, I love you. I love you, too. (Little Eli sighs) He's awake! Thank you, Watawna. You must eat to get strong. (Big Eli sighs) Thank you. (horse whinnies) (Big Eli groans) It's good to see the world's still here, oh. Here, hold onto my shoulder. Thanks, son, I feel a little shaky. (speaker speaking in foreign language) He is saying hello. (Big Eli speaking in foreign language) (Little Eli speaking in foreign language) (eagle chirps) There's Lady, son. Go get my glove for me. Okay. (Big Eli groans) Nice looking salmon. Here, Pa. Thank you. (speaking in foreign language) (speaker speaking in foreign language) (Little Eli speaking in foreign language) (speaker speaking in foreign language) (Big Eli speaking in foreign language) (whistle tweets) Come on, girl. (upbeat orchestral music) (eagle chirps) Oh, it's gonna take my shoulder a little while to get well. Did you miss me? She missed you. Why don't you say hi to Watawna? I want to thank both of you. That's my girl. You're sure pretty. (eagle screeches) (upbeat orchestral music continues) Now, you have to remember that Pa and Lady were a team. They hunted together, they explored together. She was his eyes in the sky. I believe that Lady was as much responsible for mapping out the northwest as he was. Well, as he got his legendary strength back, so did Lady. Their spirits seemed bonded together, like each wasn't really whole without the other. (group cheers) As the summer months grew to a close, the day was put aside when the men of the village captured and broke wild horses. It was to be one of the greatest moments of my life. (horses galloping) (group shouts) (horses galloping) (group shouts) (horses galloping) (group shouts) (horses galloping) (Big Eli laughs) (Watawna laughs) (group shouts) Where is Eli? He should be here. (slow orchestral music) (horse whinnies) Hold on, son! (slow orchestral music continues) That's my boy. (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (birds chirping) I must be going soon. What of Little Eli? While I had the fever, I had a vision that I could fly high in the sky like an eagle. I saw all the way out to the west. You know, now that Eli's growing into a man and I'm stronger, I feel this is where I must go. I too am strong, you will need someone to care for you and the boy. I owe you my life, Watawna, and I know you're strong, but this is no journey for a woman. I'm not afraid. I know you're not afraid. I only wish to care for you and the boy. You cannot go. This is not a journey for a woman, I'm sorry. Watawna! (birds chirping) (owl hoots) (cricket chirps) (crickets continue chirping) Where's Watawna? Shouldn't she be back by now? It's best we leave Watawna alone. She needs some time to think, son. I want you to get some rest, go back to sleep. We're gonna be leaving at first light. (owl hoots) (horse whinnies) (Hoches singing in foreign language) (group singing in foreign language) (group continues singing in foreign language) Pa always said the test of a friendship was how you said goodbye, and when my new friends of the village bid us farewell, it seemed a very special goodbye indeed. Trouble was, we didn't get to say goodbye to the best friend we'd made, Watawna. (birds chirping) Here, Pa. Getting a little warm? Yeah. (twig snaps) (birds chirping) (birds continue chirping) (birds continue chirping) (birds continue chirping) (eagle screeches) (birds chirping) (birds continue chirping) Why do you keep looking back? It's Watawna. You mean she's following us? That's what she's doing. (birds chirping) (wind whistles) (wind continues whistling) (Big Eli panting) (no audio) (no audio) Only God can paint a picture like this, son. Maybe Ma painted it. (Big Eli laughs) I bet she helped him. I don't see Watawna following us anymore. Oh, she'll be coming along before long. (eagle screeches) (slow orchestral music) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (eagle screeches) (slow orchestral music continues) A woman's hands aren't supposed to be bloody. (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (ominous orchestral music) (horse whinnies) Hey, Chief, peace. You got furs? Like to trade for a beautiful tomahawk? Come, come join my camp, please, all in peace. Yes. Get down and come, bring your furs with you. Come join my camp. (bird caws) (no audio) (water splashes) (horse whinnies) Hyah, danged Indian horses, come on! Whoa, whoa, whoa! (horse whinnies) (Hatchett shouts) Hold on, hold it! Hold it, whoa, hold, stop! (yells) Weasel, the plew, the plews! (Weasel sputters) Help! I'm trying to, trying to get up, oh! Get the plews, forget about me! Can you get him, Weasel? Get those pelts! (overlapping chattering) Get the pelts! Get the pelts, get that damn fur! They're floating away, I can't reach them. (eagle screeches) (river trickles) Hey, look! (river trickles) Looks like someone's lost their fur pelts. I know three men in that business. Yeah, I bet one of them has one eye. (eagle screeches) (eagle continues screeching) Something's wrong. (ominous orchestral music) (slow music) These furs belong to our dead brothers. And these are not my pelts. The man who killed your brothers could be the man with one eye. And why should we believe the golden hair? (slow music continues) (eagle screeches) (eagle chirps) (speaker speaking in foreign language) (eagle screeches) Thanks, girl. (eagle chirps) There, that ought to do her. They'll dry out in no time. Well, what are we gonna do now? We'll head north. Didn't you say they're having a fine fur season up there? Of course, we were having a fine fur season down here, weren't we? Somebody lost our plews. Don't look at me. Don't look at me, my hind end. You should have grabbed them when you seen me trying to assist our partner here. So where were you when the trouble hit, huh? (laughs) You calling me dumb? Don't you pull on me, boy. Come on and get it, come on! Damn it, you stop, I'm telling you, squabbling. Jake, put that away. Weasel, put it down. Now, gentlemen, here. Gentlemen, let's have a toast to fine furs. And them dead Indians? (laughs) Yes, and dead Indians, yes. Give me the wine, son. (wings flapping) (no audio) Look over there. Where? It's his bird. (eagle screeches) Who? That's Eli's! Big Eli's dead. Maybe he is and maybe he isn't. That bird's gonna be dead right now. (eagle screeches) (gun fires) (gun fires) (Hatchett screams) (wings flapping) (rifle clicks) (gun fires) (eagle screeches) That's Lady. That was good shooting, boss. You bet. This thing is starting to make my head itch. Yeah, I know what you mean. Eli, you can't fly. (horses galloping) (horses continue galloping) (eagle chirps) Lady, oh, Lady. Oh, Lady. (eagle screeches) Oh, Lady. Eli, you and Watawna stay here. You stay with Lady. (eagle screeches) Oh, Lady. (eagle chirps) (fire crackles) (Jake groans) (Indians shouting) (horse whinnies) (gun fires) (Indians shouting) Get, get away from me, get away! (screams) (slow orchestral music) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (rifle clicks) McDonaugh. Do you have the heart to give an only man with one eye a break? Do you have the guts to go one on one? No weapons, McDonaugh. I'll do that for you, Hatchett. (men grunting) (Big Eli cries out) (men grunting) (Hatchett cries out) (men grunting) (water splashing) You gotta help me. All right, give me your hand. McDonaugh, help, McDonaugh! McDonaugh, give me your hand, McDonaugh! No, no, McDonaugh, don't let go! Hold on, McDonaugh. Eli, don't let go. Hang on, Hatchett. Eli, hold on! Hang on! Don't let go! Eli McDonaugh! Hatchett! McDonaugh, you help me, Eli! Hatchett! Oh, Eli, don't let me die! McDonaugh, help! Damn you, McDonaugh, damn you! (Hatchett screams) (water splashes) (water continues splashing) (Big Eli sighs) (river splashes) (birds chirping) Is she gonna be okay? I don't know, son. Her wound is pretty bad. She's gotta be okay. Your father will do the best he can. I gotta get some of this blood off of this wing so I can see how bad the bone is, get a splint on this. You be strong, Lady. We'll do the best we can for you. (slow music) Let me set Lady down there. (eagle chirps) (slow music continues) You just rest right there. That's a girl, that's a girl, easy, easy. (eagle chirps) I know. It doesn't look good, son. We'll do what we can for Lady, I know it hurts. (slow music continues) (eagle chirps) You gotta keep your strength up. (eagle chirps) Still not looking all strong, are you? (slow music continues) That's a good girl. (slow music continues) You okay, Lady, huh? You're not looking too good, are you? After we get you a little water, I'm gonna have to take a look at your wing, all right? It might hurt a little bit, nice and easy, nice and easy. (slow orchestral music) Got you right there, didn't they? You're gonna be okay, you'll be all right. (slow orchestral music continues) Huh, let's open your wing up a little bit. Does that hurt, huh? It was an awful sad time for all of us, especially for Pa. Although it was never spoken, we knew that if Lady didn't get better and fly again, our lives would never be the same. All we could do was to wait and hope, and hoping with all our might is what we did. (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (slow orchestral music continues) (eagle chirps) Hi, Lady, hope I didn't scare you. I'm very worried. You've gotta fly, Pa says if you can't, that you're better off dead. I don't want you to die, so you'd better fly, Lady. You just gotta fly, I know you can do it. Sleep good, see you in the morning.

We've done all we can for her. It's up to you, girl, you gotta fly. (eagle chirps) You just have to fly. You gotta fly. (eagle chirps) Fly, Lady! Go on and fly, Lady! Fly! Fly, girl! Fly, girl! Fly! Go, Lady! Go, Lady! (slow orchestral music) Higher! Higher, fly! Fly, Lady! Fly! Go, girl! Fly, Lady! Fly!
