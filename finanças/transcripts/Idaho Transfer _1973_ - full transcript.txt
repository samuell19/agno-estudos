(soft wind blowing) (rustling) - [Man] I've got one. - Great, what's his length? - Approximately 36. I'm gonna tag him now. - Okay wait a sec, let me tune it in. Grab the label number 11. - If I get lucky, maybe I could find number 12 before sunset. - Okay I'm gonna head back now, see you later. (light music) (flag clinking) (lightly tense music) (machine whining) (light music) (thumping) - What time is it? - [Woman] About five after three. - Were you having problems? - No. Got a couple new snakes. Why, were you waiting? - Not very long. Evans is sinking the lag time in the other unit. - Can't we make it better? They use something besides chocolate. - We get vanilla next week, it's been ordered. Hey, Isa, your sister got here. - [Isa] Karen, where is she? - She was in your father's office. - I'll see ya. - Evans, I need six more trackers, where are they? - [Evans] Tomorrow? - I really need them. - [Evans] I'll see what I can do. You know your sister got here. - Yeah. Hi, where's Karen? - [Dad] Lewis has her. He's removing her braces. - What'd she look like? - Lovely. - How's her head? - I think she's gonna be all right. I haven't told her anything about the project yet. Decided to leave that to you. - Thanks, chicken. - Jess and I have to fly to Denver this afternoon in about an hour. Got somebody going crackers over us down there. Nothing that won't blow over. - They know anything? - No, it's the same as before. This one's from Washington though. I may have to give him a tour. - Not again. - Well he doesn't sound too smart. But he is asking some uncomfortable questions. I'll be back Monday. I'll alert Lewis by phone if he's gonna come back with us. - Yeah, well as long as everybody knows ahead of time. - In the morning it might be a good idea to drive by the lava. Show her what it's like before she has to transfer into it. - Should I tell her everything? - Yeah, but go easy on the theories and tell Cleveland to cool it with his horror stories until she gets used to the whole thing. Don't do that. She can have room 27. Show her around. Make sure she understands exactly who's clear and who isn't on security. Just like you did with Judy. (buzzing) I'll see you later. (keys clinking) - Hi, we've got your sister. Lewis is yanking her braces. - I heard. Who's this, this Jennifer? - Uh huh, there's a hairline fracture but it's not so bad. - [Isa] So how is she? - She's all right. She has to stick to these crutches for a couple of weeks but she can transfer. - Hey. Oh wow. - Haven't I got a knockout of a sister here? - Soon as I can get this harway out of here she'll be a real natural. How you doing? - Really good. Sure you know how to do this, huh? - I think so. - [Woman Doctor] You had a transfer this afternoon, didn't you? - Yeah. Got some new snakes. - That's an 84. - [Karen] Uh, uh, uh huh. - [Lewis] Smile. - [Karen] Lewis is nice. - [Isa] Yeah, he and dad have worked together for almost two years now. - [Karen] So how did this Jennifer chick wreck her foot? - [Isa] Well she was horsing around with Arthur out at the lavas. - [Karen] The guy with the blonde hair, the one I met? He's really cute, you know. Daddy says he's a genius. - [Isa] Yeah he knows a lot about zoology, mammals. See all the kids in the project are highly trained, like scientists, you know. Jennifer, she's a full fledged botanist at 16. - [Karen] Does he sort of like her or something? - Yeah, pretty close. Everything looks about the same. There are lots of subtle differences. They're mostly biological. Like in the reptiles you're gonna help me with. The month is August. I think, late August by the stars. Might even be September by now, can't remember. See but the weather isn't too different. It's starting to get a little cold though. But the tree readings will tell us more there. - Like who knows all about this? - Nobody. Nobody outside the project, not even the government. - Will they even suspect? - Nope. They still think we're working on material projection. They don't know anything about the time bit. That's why daddy has to play tricks. If any of the creeps ask questions, we just give them a phony tour. See, Dad and Lewis are trying to get it together to secretly transfer a lot of young people into the future, bypass the eco crisis or whatever it is. Start a new civilization. - Daddy can't come, huh? - Uh uh, something to do with the kidneys. Lewis says it's curtains for anybody much over 20 to try it. Don't say anything to him about it, okay? - I won't. - [Isa] Did you get in any romances at the clinic? - [Karen] No, it's too much trouble to get very close to anybody over there. - [Isa] Still a virgin? - [Karen] No, I thought they told you about that. I got raped. Happened in the couple of months after I got to the clinic by this guy named Paul. I don't know, I never really thought about it much until he did it. So he got called off to another clinic, never heard from him again. What about you? - I don't know. I guess I sort of like being alone a lot. There's hundreds of square miles of that stuff by the Snake River Plain. The last of it bubbled up at the time of Christ. See in the present time sense, the units are in the project building where you were yesterday. - [Karen] Uh huh. - [Isa] When we transfer this afternoon, we'll end up out there someplace. About 10 feet under the surface of the lava. Only it'll be 56 years later. - And there's nobody left? - Well Cleve and I went down to Aberdeen and American Falls, and it was all abandoned. Couldn't get anything on any of the radio bands and didn't sight any air traffic. - Afternoon, ladies. - Hi. - Wonder if you'd be so kind to give us a ride. - Sure. - Yeah, we're just going 10 miles down the road. - All right, let's skate on out of here. (light music) (car starting) ♪ Traveling man oh traveling man ♪ - Wow, sure glad you guys picked us up. Me and my lady starting to get warm out there. - [Karen] Where y'all going to? - We're going to a festival in Denver. - What are you doing up here in Idaho? - Well it hasn't started yet. In about another couple three weeks. Everyone will shoot on over and see what's going on. We've just been sleeping out, digging at stars and trees, have a fine old time. We just gypsies. We ain't got a care in the world. - [Isa] You guys gonna be at the festival huh? - [Man] Oh yeah we keep a big family of people. We all just kind of scatter around so we meet up at festivals. ♪ Traveling man, oh traveling man ♪ - [Man] Thanks for the ride. - [Gyspy Woman] Yeah thanks, darling, have a nice day. - Okay you too, see you later. - I hope we see you at the festival. All right now. (revving) - Jesus. - Come on. You too. As soon as you get in, rule number one, lock the door. And rule number two, take off your clothes. - Sounds familiar. - Oh, these pants are a bitch. - Why do we have to wear this stuff anyway? - Oh they're good in the lavas. You'll see when you get there. You can't wear anything heavy or anything with zippers. Nothing metallic. Cleve left his sunglasses on once. When he transferred, it almost ripped his ears off. Okay, never ever try to transfer with anything over your necks. Socks are okay though. Understand? Come on. Okay, this is a transfer set. - Is it okay if I sit on it? - Sure. And this, unlock it, is a material projection compartment. Give me your pants and jacket. Close it and make sure it's locked. Now this is the transfer control unit. The white lights are always on. That indicates the unit has power. These are the activating switches that are thrown in sequence. And then you wait for the corresponding lights to come on and that means that the unit has been phased or it's ready to go. This is the transfer bar. You just need to press it lightly but you'll see when I do it, okay? Okay. This red line here. This is the danger line. Anything inside this has to be secured to the transfer grid. There can't be anything loose. Over here, that's the power switch to our main reactor. And over here, Karen. Behind these panels are all the adjustment rods. They're used to keep each unit in tune with the other. They control the lag time and the extent of penetration into the future. See we keep them constant 'cause they're extremely sensitive. Evans has to tune them every few days. It's not like you sit down and dial a date, you know? Okay, sit here. Like that, and straddle. Move up a little. Okay. Now don't touch anything. And you can put your hands on your knees and keep them there. And relax. (switches clicking) (light beeping) - Isa? - [Isa] Here. - Jesus. Where's the building? - We're 11 miles away from it. It's over there. Only there's not much left of it. Tore it down for some reason. - Think you'll ever have any kids? - If we all transfer permanently, I'll try. I'm not sure who with though. Probably Cleve. We just have to get more people. Can't start civilization with just 12 people. You know I was tempted to kidnap that couple we picked up on the road this morning. - Why didn't we? I mean why didn't we ask them to come with us? - Too dangerous to security. And everything isn't well enough organized yet. It might be in a few weeks, not now. - Wonder how long they'll live. - The hitchhikers? Try not to think of 'em. They don't matter anymore. - You know I think I like it here. - Yeah I like it here too. It's peaceful, nobody trying to wreck anybody else. Except those who have to, to get along, like the flies and the lizards and the gopher snakes. - This stuff, it's beautiful, you know? I used to have nightmares that look like this. Only they were beautiful nightmares. I suppose it doesn't make any sense, does it? What you said about how we're the only ones now, I mean if everybody else did die some people would be afraid in our position, alone and all. I don't know. I think it's sort of nice. Like you just said, nobody's out to get anybody else. I could just fall asleep in the sun, wouldn't have to worry about anybody. - Well who are you afraid of? - Most of all? Everybody, I guess. - Dammit, number four has run out on us. - Yoohoo, number four. - Just leave it blank. (radio beeping) Number five is 62.2 Remind me on our way back to check in for number four. - Okay. - What's his length? - Number four? - Yeah. - 18 inches. - Oh, probably got himself swallowed. - By what? - One of his friends. - How far is this one? - About a quarter mile. Getting tired? - No, not really. (tense music) (gasping) Isa? (clacking) Isa, are you okay? - [Isa] Help me out of here. - Come on. Are you okay? Isa? - I don't know. Karen, go get Cleve. - Cleve? Cleve? Isa. Isa? I think we better transfer. Here, lay down. (machine humming) Isa. Isa. Lewis? Lewis! Lewis! Anybody, can anybody hear me? I can't find. (somber music) - Fresh from argyle. And another letter from your father. I couldn't bring any root beer this time. You mean you haven't opened any of them? Hey, I thought you decided to talk. You know it would really help if you could tell me if there's anything you want. I mean other than the junk in your room, I'm not really sure. - I like piano. - I think you should read your father's letters. It's not fair. - I wonder what a piano would sound like out here. - You know he's concerned about you. Why don't you just write him a note or something? - [Man] Hi, love. - She's being a bitch again. She's not even opening the letters. Hasn't read a damned one. - Just don't push me. - You know, you might not have much more time to sit around and think about yourself. - I don't know what I'm thinking. I'm just blank. - Well. It's getting kind of close on the other side these days. George, that's your father. He's having a tough time of it. - Karen is blank. - Dear Karen. - I'm going for a walk. - Why don't you just tear them up instead of keeping them around? - [Man] Hey man, we forgot about Clyde. - [Woman] Clyde? Oh yeah, we can't forget about Clyde. - [George] It's their pet snake. Can they go back and get it? - [Man] I guess so. - It'll only be a minute. (clattering) (light music) - They're gonna post guards and suspend the entire project by tomorrow. - The timers were sent home after lunch and told not to return in the morning. - [Man] I think it's all over with. - You think they're onto us? - Mm-mmm. - What about the inits? - They can't touch the main from the reactor station. We got the power. - For a while. - I don't understand it. Arthur drove Jenna to Arco this morning. Nobody said a word. What about Lewis and Nora? - Split, disappeared. George doesn't have the slightest idea where they can be. But he said a couple of agents picked up Evans in town this morning. Said they were flying him to Denver for questioning whatever that means. (creaking) - [Joanna] Lewis, what are you doing here? - [Lewis] Hello, Joanna. Come on take this. Nora should be coming through number one. There's she's done. - Hey. - Hey Nora. Oh my god. (light music) - I saw some people I didn't recognize this morning and they didn't look too friendly. - Yo I know something's going on, that's all. So if you decide to stay, what you gotta do is get yourself out of this damn desert before the snows come. Where's your inventory list? - In my room. - I'll need those and a list of all the rooms that contain survival equipment - No problem. - All right. Did Mike and Leslie read you in this morning? - [Cleveland] Yeah. He said he was about 12 miles away and he should be in by sunset. - Yeah, what about Karen? - [Arthur] She went for a walk. - Okay. - Hey, let's try for those lists. - What happens if somebody gets caught? - I don't know. - What about you? - What do you mean? - You shouldn't have come. - I always wanted to try, mate. - How long will you last? What about Nora? - She might make it. She knew the risk. She decided. - They're gone. (tense music) - This is Karen Braden, would you please connect me with my father? My father, George Braden. Jesus Christ, can't you just? (slamming) (tense music) - We've got someone on the inside. I think in the main project area. - In the main area? - Yeah. (tense music) (gasping) - Jesus Christ! - What the hell are you doing in here? - I'm getting supplies, you dumbass. - There's guards all over this place. You picked a fine time to steal toilet tissue. - Tissues?! - Come on. Forget it, leave it, leave it! - [Karen] Wait a minute! - Leave it! - Goddamn. These taste weird, I don't know what kind of shit you're on. - Shut up. Hey come on, shut up. - But why? - Shut up. (clacking) Okay. Come on. Come on. Here, put these in there. You got everything? Okay. - What about your glasses? - Oh yeah. Here. You all ready? Okay, here we go. (clicking) (machine humming) - Thank you. - It's all right. (clicking) (somber music) - Are these things airtight? - No good if you're underground. - I'm cold. - There you go. - I'm still cold. - Hey Arthur, what do you think it is? - I'm not entirely sure but the unit's completely out. The ready lights don't even come on. - Did you check two? - Yeah, it's locked. I think somebody spent the night in there. (knocking) - [Lewis] What's going on? - The other unit's completely out. It won't transfer. - Hey. - Hey. Go down and hit the switches, Ronald. - Sure. - [Lewis] Hey, is Karen down there with you? - [Ronald] Yeah she's here. - I wonder if they could have got to the locals. - [Ronald] I get nothing. - They did something. - Lewis! Jen says the units are out. - Yeah it looks like that. - What's wrong? I mean for how long? - I don't know, Ronald? - All I could see are my flood. - Were there any little clicks when you hit the green switches? - Nothing. - Shit. - I don't want to stay. - [Lewis] We better have a meeting. - Shouldn't somebody stay in each of the units just in case? - Once the main is off, it takes 12 hours from powerup before you can get a response. Just relax, Leslie. - [Karen] Well, what are we gonna do now? - [Ronald] It's been decided that you and I will go directly overland to the Bruneau Sand Dunes and meet the others who'd come down the river by boat. Then we'll all head for Portland. - [Karen] Portland? Portland, Oregon? - [Ronald] That's right. - [Karen] But that's 500 miles or something! - This is the overland road that Karen and I will be taking. We're gonna wait here at the dunes for the others to come up the river from Pocatello. We'll leave notes for you here and here. - Okay. - Watch for a flag here. How's that foot? - Well, sort of miserable. - You're not worried, are you? - No. Leslie's acting a little freaky though. I don't know. I don't know why she wants to go back. There must be somebody. - [Cleveland] You're not going through Twin Falls? - Probably not worth the effort. We'll cut through Shoshone. - You hear about the radio batteries? - Yeah. I guess we'll have to use flares every night. - Hey Karen. - [Lewis] Michael! Audrey needs some help with that tent. - Okay. Karen, here's an extra vanilla for you. - Thanks Micheal. Hey Ronald, look what they gave me. - [Ronald] Who? - Arthur and Jen. It comes apart like a puzzle. Only I don't know how to do it yet. They're gonna show me when we see them again. Isn't it beautiful? - Yeah it's nice. - You're just jealous. - Grow up. Look, you should have had this all packed by now. We're about ready to go. (pole clanking) (somber music) (cheering and clapping) - [Karen] Ronald? Do you know anything about having babies? I mean about delivery and all. - [Ronald] I hear it's a mess. Why? - [Karen] Well when I have one I'm trying to think of where we might be. I hope it'll be warm enough. And we'll have to have a sanitary place with water. They always need water. - [Ronald] We could talk about it when the time comes. And if it doesn't, it won't be the end of the world. - [Karen] That's not very funny, Ronald. Oh shit. - What's the matter? - I dropped the ring. It's all undone. Do you know how to do them? - No I don't. (somber music) We'll camp here tonight. It's getting dark. I guess we're gonna have to sleep under the rocks again. - Wanna zip them together? Ronald, you can do anything you want, you know. - I'm gonna get this camp together. It's close to flare time. (calm music) Might be somebody inside. - Shut up. - Waiting for us. - I can't see a thing. There's dust inside of this. How could dust get inside of here? (creaking) (knocking) Hey, Ronald, the keys are still in it. You wanna steal it? (clacking) (clinking) (door creaking) - Karen? Here. - Ronald? Never mind. (light music) - It's close to a hundred cars down there. Southern Pacific, I think. It'll take us about an hour to get there and back. Could be worth it, might be something we could use. What's the matter? - I don't wanna go look at a goddamn train, I'm tired. - For Christ's sake. Stay here then, here. I'll be back. - Okay. - [Man] Come on Cleve, let's go. - Okay, wait one second, okay? Where's Lewis, we're ready to start moving again. - [Nora] He's not coming with us anymore. - What? - I said Lewis isn't coming with us. Here, see, he left this note for you. He's dying, Cleve. His kidneys are hemmorhaging. He says he'll just be a problem to us from now on. He's helped us as much as he can and he wants to be alone now so leave him be. - That's ridiculous, now which way did he go? - He told me not to tell you. You couldn't possibly find him now anyway. He wants to be alone now! Elgin, don't look for him! - Hey Lewis! Lewis! (clanging) (banging) (gate creaking) (tense music) - Let's see. Refrigerators? Probably 50,000 gallons of Chartreuse high gloss enamel. We could paint Portland. I used to have this girlfriend at the clinic that had Chartreuse hair. (sighs) Well, I don't suppose it was empty. - No, it's not empty. They were all in plastic bags on their way somewhere. Probably a dumping point at the loan. I think they were coming from the coast. (light music) - Adrian, how do you like that for a boy? - For what? - Boy or girl. Suppose it doesn't matter since we have a fresh start now. We call the girls boys names and the boys girls names and nobody'll know the difference. Names, I mean. - Learn the rope, multiply and do the same act all over again. Although they probably won't be able to have an encore like we did. - Wonder what we use for last names. I'm a woman, you know. - That gives you the right to have a bunch of kids? - Yes. A bunch of whole bunch if I want. It's different now. - What's different about it? It's a beginning, right? And the beginning is as much a part of the end as the middle. - It's a better kind of beginning. - A different kind of beginning. Different kind of middle. And a shiny new end. So where've we been? - Someplace. (bird chirping) Help start a fire. We're having some of that soup stuff again. - Okay. - They're two days late, huh? - Yeah. They should have been here today even if they had to walk. - Ronald, I have something to tell you. - [Ronald] Really? - Yeah, I think I'm pregnant by Arthur. We made it a few days after that thing with my sister happened. Anyway, I'm about a week and a half late now. - [Ronald] Doesn't mean you're pregnant. - I know, I've missed before, but, this is different. I just thought you should know. I guess you won't have to do anything with me anymore. I mean I won't try to make you or anything. Think they've left yet? - Who, Arthur? - Yeah. - Probably not. - Well, when Cleve and the others come do you think we can wait till they catch up? - No, we'll stick to the plan. - What if I stay? - There isn't enough food and we can't spare any. Besides, if you missed Arthur, you'd be in a mess. - I have to tell him. I'd give my right arm for a cheeseburger right now. Think there are any cows left? - I doubt it. - Ronald, look! Right there, look. - [Ronald] It's Cleve! (light music) - [Elgin] It was just a couple of kids at first. But then we followed them and found a small tribe of third generation survivors living by the river. - The oldest ones we saw were about 30. They don't live very long and can't do very much, just sort of gurgle and bump around a lot. - [Elgin] The most compassionate people you can imagine. - [Cleveland] No language, no government, no agriculture. - Well what do they eat? - Whatever they can get in their mouth. Wild potatoes mostly. - And she's deaf. I think practically all of them were. Oh but they were happy, incredibly happy. And they shared everything. - [Elgin] Some were so retarded they can't even find food for themselves. But others give them enough to get buy. - Breanne's probably a lot smarter than the rest of them. - She's almost normal except for her hearing and a slight motor retardation. - You know, if we find more of them on the coast, maybe we can find a boyfriend as good as she is and get them together, see if she can't have a normal child. - Why don't you try with her, Cleve? I mean not that you're perfect stock or anything. Wouldn't she be better off with your baby than somebody else who's like her? I think it might be kind of interesting. Well Jesus, I didn't mean anything by that. Just seems like it would be better. I mean it does look like it's up to all of us now if they're all like her. Anyway, guess what, y'all? I'm pregnant. Not him, it was Arthur. Like it was all right with Jen. I mean we talked about it and everything. I just thought we should have as many as we could. - Lewis said he told you. - He told me. - Told you what? - We're sterile. - Sterile, who? - All of us. You. - But that's crazy. - Transferring. - But I can feel it. - [Ronald] It's permanent, according to Lewis. - Karen. - Well how the hell could Lewis possibly know something like that? I don't believe you, you're all liars. - [Woman] Okay, I'll put this down here. - Ronald, how come she thinks she's pregnant? - She missed her period. I think it's emotional. - What do you think, Cleve? - Not a chance. Specially with one of us. - She was rambling on about having kids. I just couldn't tell her. I'm sorry. - Sure she's gonna be all right? - Let her think about it. It came kind of fast. She has to figure it out by herself. Same as all of us. - Wanna go take a look at those boats? - [Ronald] Sure. Hard to navigate? - Nah. We hit bottom a lot. And it's murder when you gotta port it. I mean they weren't exactly built for running rivers with. And I think we're kind of screwed if we don't find rubber rafts at the air base. We might have to spend the winter in some pretty cold country. - We can do it. There's stuff growing up there. - Depends on the competition. - Think there's many of them? - [Cleveland] Probably all over the place from here to China. - [Ronald] Dangerous? - [Cleveland] Hope not. I found a pistol and some box of bullets. They didn't seem to know what it was. - Yeah with Boise, you might have some real bastards. - You know I think the winters must be really bad 'cause they burnt everything they can get their little idiot hands on. - How long do you think it'll take us to get to Bonneville? - Couple of weeks. Add two weeks if we wait for Arthur somewhere along the way. - You ever been big on skipping rocks? - Not especially. - The distance between the skips get shorter and shorter and shorter. Then it sinks. (splashing) If you get a good rock, one that's not too flat, you get a lot of skips out of it. A good rock stays up there a long time. (splashing) (gentle music) (splashing) You okay? - Did you already tell Arthur and Jennifer? - Lewis wasn't sure he should tell anybody at first. Then at the rest point, just before we left the others he told me. He was gonna tell them the next day. - This isn't fair. I haven't even got a goddamn dress. - Hey we're having a campfire. - I think I'll stay here tonight. - I don't think you have to leave anything behind. Just have a beautiful time along with all the other drunk litter in the universe and say goodbye. I don't know what else to tell you. Perpetuation, all the crap that goes with it is a big hoax anyway. - Shh. (light music) (flagpole clinking) (clanking) - Arthur? It's me, I'm back. (clinking) (cans clanking) (flies buzzing) (ominous music) Arthur? (ominous music) Oh god, no. (flies buzzing) (gasping) (clanking) (bashing) (banging) - You can't go any place! They don't work! Karen, they don't work! (sobbing) (banging) - Shut up! (banging) Shut up! (banging) Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Just be quiet! (screaming) (sobbing) (banging) (machine humming) - Karen? I didn't know you were supposed to come back. (clicking) (banging) (machine humming) - [Karen] Will you help me please? You've gotta help me get back before all of this happened, they're all dead. Please show me. Just show me what to do. - Jensen! (slamming) Jensen come here quick! - Stupid son of a bitch. (banging) - Well how in the hell did she get in there? - I don't know, she came from nowhere. (clattering) - Yes, yes. (bell ringing) (knocking) (knocking) (machine whining) - What's the problem? - She's in here, sir. - Miss? (knocking) You in there, come on out. Miss, you in there! (knocking) Come out right now. (knocking) (clinking) - Karen? Look, Karen. Listen to me. (wind blowing) They were using everything. Everything was being used up. Karen! (light music) (wind blowing) (chimes tinkling) - [Karen] I'm a woman, you know. - All of us. You. - [Karen] We could just mate. There are arms around us. - Karen. - [Isa] Karen? - [Karen] It's all right now, it's all right. I just can't remember any interruptions. I mean, it's so hard to remember. - Karen! (low humming) (slamming) (door shutting) (woman screaming) - Are you sure that was one of them? - [Mom] Of course it was. - What happens when we run out? - [Mom] We just put one in. We won't need another for quite a ways. - I didn't mean that. I mean what if we run out of all of them and we can't even find any? - [Dad] They'll figure out another way for us. - [Mom] We can use something else. - But what if that's too hard or expensive? And what if they decide they can't change? We'll all use each other then, won't we? (dramatic music)
