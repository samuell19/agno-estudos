I love money. I love money more than I love the things it can buy. Does that surprise you? Money. It don't care whether I'm good or not. It don't care whether I snore or not. It don't care which God I pray to. There are only three things in this world with that kind of unconditional acceptance... dogs... Doughnuts... And money. Only money is better. You know why? Because it don't make you fat and it don't poop all over the living room floor. There's only one thing I like better... Other people's money. All right, now, squeeze in over here. I want to see all your faces. Now face the camera. Get up on the floor, sir. Happy Thanksgiving! How you doing, tom? Happy Thanksgiving, jorgy! Happy Thanksgiving, everybody! Happy Thanksgiving. Smile, everybody! Take a good one, Elton. The stock is up another point and a half! Somebody's up to something, jorgy. Good news. Stock is up. Don't worry about it. Gus, you got your teeth in? Ready now! Cheeks up! New england wire and cable! New england wire and cable! Yes! All right! Up two points.

Morning, Arthur. Say good morning to Carmen. She's very happy today. Aren't you, my sweet? Good morning, Carmen. Cranberry juice is fresh today, boss. Oh, good. You never let me down, Arthur. You never let me down. Good morning, sir. Samuels. Good morning, Mr. Garfield. Good morning, Mr. Garfield. Good morning, Mr. Garfield. Good morning, Mr. Garfield. Good morning. Morning. Good morning, Mr. Garfield. Morning. Good morning, Mr. Garfield. Good morning, Mr. Garfield. Work, work! Good morning, Mr. Garfield. Good morning. Good morning, Mr. Garfield. Yeah! Good morning, Mr. Garfield. You look very nice today. I'm not paying you to be polite. What's happening? Good morning, Mr. Garfield. Morning. Morning. Mr. Holt wants to see you for dinner if you can. The overly brothers will fly you to Texas or come here... your choice. When I die, Harriet, put on my gravestone... "he never went to Texas." I'll call the engraver. Where's the cinnamon? Out of cinnamon. If I can't count on dunkin' donuts, who do I count on? On me, sir. Hah! Granger. Trundel canning. Tell me. Trundel's being sued by the townspeople, sir. Failed to comply with environmental restrictions. Hmm... And there are claims of illness from the citizenry. Good. Just before they're sent to jail, bid. Yes, sir. Angeli. Yo? Eastern motels. Outstanding shares? Uh...6 million, Mr. Garfield. Slate owns 21/2 million. Mr. Morganstern wants to talk to you. I'd rather talk to my mother. Pfeiffer! Yeah? What about this new england wire and cable? It's too beautiful. Is it booby-trapped? I, uh... I, uh... I, uh... I... Can't seem to find any problems... Mr. Garfield. Neither can I. Richardson. Yes, sir. Let's talk to these people. Call the man in charge, whoever he is. Yes, sir. New england wire and cable. Good morning. The general manager, please. That'd be Mr. Coles. Who shall I say is calling? Lawrence Garfield. Just one moment, please. What'd he want? To come up and see us. Look the place over, he said. What's wrong with that? He's a shareholder. It's not that simple. What this man does is no secret. Bill, you got the jitters. Wall street's in the liquidation business these days, jorgy. My father founded this company 81 years ago. I took over 26 years ago. I control this company, and nobody's going to liquidate us. What a shit pit. Ohh... Look at this. Look at this. I haven't seen a place this classy since I left the Bronx. Welcome to new england wire and cable. I'm bea Sullivan, Mr. Jorgenson's assistant. How do you do? I do good. Would you like to invite your chauffeur in to keep warm? He's a yard chauffeur, honey. Bring him inside, you spoil him. Is there a dunkin' donuts in this town? Dunkin' donuts? No, I don't think so. Crispy cremes, something? I'm afraid not. But we have coffee, and Emma might have a breakfast roll. A breakfast roll? Do you have an elevator? I'm embarrassed. It's out of order. You know elevators. Any oxygen? Should have warned me, I'd have brought a paramedic. Is it much further? I'd like to get there before dark. Jorgy, this is Mr. Garfield. Mr. Garfield, Andrew jorgenson, our chairman. Call me jorgy. Everybody else does. Sorry about the elevator. Mr. Coles, our president and general manager. Emma, bring in the coffee! Last limousine we saw here was in '48 when Harry Truman was running for president. He stood out there on those stairs, exactly where you were. Is that so? That was the golden age. Rebuilding America and all that. Old Harry made a great speech that day. Is that so? Oh, yes. He was very impressive. He's the only democrat bea and I ever voted for. You know much about the wire and cable business? I know if the cable's out of whack, the elevator don't go up. I'm thinking about the doughnuts. Mr. Garfield was wondering if we had any. Uh, bill, do we have doughnuts? I don't think so. How's that coffee coming along? Here we are, Mr. Garfield. Thank you. Sugar and cream? Sugar. I'll take care of it. I could have Emma get some doughnuts. No, no. Why don't we get down to business? What's the matter? You're not interested in doughnuts? Would you like me to get some doughnuts? No. Never mind, Emma. You're right. Let's talk business. Good idea. What business are we talking about? Good coffee. Well, let's put it this way. Back in New York, I got a computer. Her name is Carmen. Every morning, right after I brush my teeth, I punch out, "Carmen, computer on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?" Now, most mornings she spits out, "Garfield, you're the fairest." But three weeks ago, she said, "Garfield, Garfield, scratch your balls. "New england"... pardon me... "new england wire and cable is the fairest of them all." New england wire and cable? I said, "what's it worth?" So she showed me the numbers. You got equipment here that cost $120 million. Even at salvage, it's worth 30, 35 million. Can I use that blackboard over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Come with me. Carmen will educate us. Going to erase this stuff here. Here. Let's... let's put down 30 million. How many acres you got? 110. 110. Carmen and I figure even as farmland, grazing land, it's worth 10 million. Is that fair? Yeah. Let's lay the 10 under the 30. That makes 40 million. And you bought other companies, right, bill? You have a plumbing, an electrical, and some kind of adhesive company. Boring, but all making a decent profit. Carmen says they're worth another 60 mil. Let's put the 60 under the 40. And you have working capital of 25 million, 100f it in cash. Let's put down 25 million, add them up, and see what you got. $125 million. The only bad news is that this wire and cable division isn't making a profit. The other divisions have to support you. Now, as a stockholder, that doesn't make me very happy. Are you finished, Mr. Garfield? No, I'm not, bill. Let's say Carmen was suffering from premenstrual syndrome. No offense. A little nuts. Let's say she was too optimistic. Let's knock off 25 million. Let's make it... $100 million. A nice round number. I like nice round numbers. Any debt? No. Any lawsuits? Any environmental bullshit? You throwing garbage in the water? Of course not. What about pension liabilities? Carmen says you're fully funded. You people are dreams. I think this meeting is over. No, no, wait. Here's the fun part. How many shares outstanding you got? 4 million. Divide that into 100 million. 25. Good. That means each share's worth $25. But that was all foreplay. Let's go for the real thing. The stock was 10 when I woke up three weeks ago. That's a 10 for a $25-item. What a sale. Something worth $25, I can buy it for 10. The company's not for sale, Mr. Garfield. I don't want your company. I just want what every stockholder wants... to make money. You are making money. You bought the stock at 10. It's now 14. The stock is 14 because I'm buying it. I'm doing my part, now you do yours. Get rid of this wire and cable division. It's a financial cancer. I want to talk to Mr. Garfield alone. What the hell are you doing, you son of a bitch? You can't come into my town, my plant, take my company. You can't do that. You live on Mars? It's called a corporate takeover. I'm not going to let you do it. It's simple. I do it all the time. Well, do it someplace else. I'm not going to commit suicide. Don't think of it as suicide. Yecchh. Think of it as euthanasia. Get out. Get out. Get out before I throw you out. Where are you going? We're just doing business. Business? With you? I got a company to run. Yeah, well, that's my point. I don't like the way my company's being run! Better get your elevator fixed! There's a goddamn fire raging here. This industry's up in flames! Call the fire department, and who shows up? Nobody. Because they're all in Japan and Singapore and Malaysia and Taiwan and every other shit hole where they're crazy about pollution. And while that inferno is raging, you're out in front mowing the lawn, tidying up, playing with your putz on my money! You'd think I was asking him for a loan. Good day, Mr. Garfield. I'm not a long-term player. They give us trouble today? They're not going to send us back to the Bronx. Don't scare me there. Richardson, I want to buy up new england wire and cable. Buy everything you can. File a 13-d. I want to finish this one quick. We're on it. Well, it's official. Our friend Garfield's intent is to take over the company. He's filed his 13-d with the s.E.C. He now owns 12% of us. What do you want to do? I own 20%. Jorgy, we've got to protect ourselves. We need legal advice. We have lawyers. They're not equipped to handle this. We need the best. We want to call Kate. Let me. What makes you think she'll come? I'll tell her we need her. We're family. Flamboyant ls and Ms. Loves to write million, doesn't he? We've never seen a man like that. He's like something out of a comic book. So they say. Hello, Kate. Jorgy. Thanks for coming. Doesn't she look splendid? I have to be back by 5:00. Mind if we get right to it? You're in charge, Kate. Now, given that someone's interested in moving in on you, you've no choice but to protect yourself. You have some options. For openers, I recommend changing your state of incorporation from Rhode Island to Delaware. Why Delaware? That's a good idea. Strong anti-takeover legislation there. That way we're not playing dead. Who the hell is playing dead? You have to protect yourself. By running away to Delaware? Jorgy, it's only on paper. This company was founded in Rhode Island. It will remain in Rhode Island. I'm talking about Delaware, not Nairobi. Come on. I own 20% of this company. The board owns another 5, the employees another 5%. That's 30%. How can this man get control? What do you want, for me to negotiate a deal or not? But there's no deal to be made. He's knocking at your door. Don't answer it, and you're inviting him in. Listen to her, jorgy. There's no deal to be made with predators. You kill it or it kills you. Well, what do you suggest? Make it worth his while to leave. What do you mean? Pay him off. Buy him out. It's greenmail, but it's done all the time. It's terrorism, and I won't do it! Any other options? You're going to lose your company. Like hell I am. You, as they say in the street, are in play. Garfield put you there, and now I'm here as your lawyer. Isn't that a hell of an irony? Me trying to save your company. Well, I can do it. Yeah? A miss Sullivan from Hudson, Bradley, and flint is here. Granger wants to discuss trundel canning, and your suits are ready for fitting. Tell them not to send the blind son of a bitch with the pins. And tell Granger he'd better make sense this time or get on the unemployment line. Shall I use those exact words? Send in Hudson, Bradley, and flint. Whew. Wow. Whew! Know what kills me? I've done seven, eight deals like this, and you know who I negotiate with? Skinny joggers with contact lenses all stinking from the same aftershave. I'm Kate Sullivan. I know your name. Cigarette? No, thank you. Don't let me stop you. Why would you stop me? What are you, a fucking lawyer? Depends on who I'm with. Welcome to my life. So, what's it going to be? Sue, settle, defend? I came to talk. Boof! Oh, that's trouble. Lawyers want to talk... nothing but trouble. How about a doughnut? No, thanks. You a health food freak? No. Just not hungry. You have to be hungry to eat doughnuts? You don't? What, are you shitting me? Have to be hungry. Why? It don't taste better that way. How would you know? What do you want? I need a month. Get lost. I need time to get everybody's act together. My act is together. If you give me some time, I think we can work something out. Settle? Work something out. I only settle when I'm in trouble. Or when it makes sense. It only makes sense when I'm in trouble. Well, if you prefer, we'll go to court, get an injunction, have a fight. All kinds of allegations. Costs them, costs you, and for what? I live in court. You got to do better than that. I won't love you anymore. Two weeks. Standstill agreement. Both sides. No more buying. Two weeks. Thank you. Whoa, whoa! We haven't talked about what I want to talk about. What's that? You and me sweating between satin sheets. Garfield, put your hand between your legs. Do it! Good. Look directly down at that little guy, and you say, "you must behave yourself when you're in the presence of a lady." If you don't say that right now, I'm resigning from this case. You must behave yourself... You must behave yourself... When you're in the presence... When you're in the presence of a lady. See? Not so hard. See you in two weeks. Wow! Did you see that, Carmen? I love it, love it, love it. Goodbye, miss Sullivan. Goodbye. Tell Erickson to arrange some money through the royal bank. Don't pay him more than we did before. Then tell hathaway I want to make a tender offer for new england wire and cable. Don't use our name. Use opm holdings. What if she finds out we broke the agreement? Richardson, were you born yesterday? What do you think she's doing? That kewpie doll's up to no good. Do it. I got us an extra two weeks. We have to move fast. Get the board to buy as many shares as possible. Use your own working capital. But that's our safety net. Then borrow the money. No borrowing. Andrew, listen to her. She's making sense. For every share you acquire, it's one less for Garfield. The more we buy, the less for him. The more it costs, the less profit he makes. Get the stock up. Mom, buy it through an out-of-state broker. I don't want to borrow money. We've been debt-free since the depression. But that's the trouble. It's your gorgeous balance sheet that makes you so attractive. Mom, get letters to the shareholders. Tell them how great business is, how wonderful the future looks. I'll do it. Great. I'll call you tomorrow. Good night. Mmm. Mmm... Good morning, honey. How you doing this morning, huh? Oh... Ooh... You got it up again. Another point and a half. Pfeiffer. Good morning, Mr. Garfield. Woody. Good morning. Harriet. Miss Sullivan's going to call tomorrow. Tell her I'm not taking calls. Then when she comes and tries storming into the office, let her push past. Don't worry. She's desperate but harmless. Find out where she lives and call the florist. Florist? Florist. You have a good evening, miss Sullivan. Hello, Michael. Oh, miss Sullivan. Uh... Here. Somebody brought these by for you. Oh, thank you. Good night. Good night. Good morning. Good morning. Oh! You ruthless son of a bitch! Excuse me? Jeez, what's her problem? Uhh! All right, all right. Sorry to get in your way. May I help you? I'm afraid Mr. Garfield isn't in. I don't care! It's all right, Harriet. It's not all right, you hypocrite! You lied! Oh. But babypoo... we had an agreement. We had a standstill! No more buying! You know nothing about opm? Opm? Not much to know. You broke the agreement! You embarrassed me with my firm and with my clients! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't come on holier-than-thou. What should I do while you drive up the price? I did no such thing. You're full of shit. All that buying coming from Rhode Island. You'd think you'd use an out-of-state firm. I know nothing about that. Who am dealing with here, mother Teresa? You want to play the game, learn to play it right. Is that what you call it, a game? The best game in the world. I'll teach you. It's easy. Make as much as you can as long as you can. Then what? Then what? Whoever has the most when he dies, wins. Look. It's the American way. I'm doing my job. I'm a capitalist. I'm simply following the law of free enterprise. What law is that? Survival of the fittest. Maybe some people don't see it that way. Maybe they see it as survival of the fattest! Why are you so hard on me? 'Cause you're not nice. Why do you have to be nice to be right? You're not right. You're what's happening. Someday we'll pass some laws and put you out of business. They can pass all the laws they want. All they can do is change the rules. They can never stop the game. I don't go away. I adapt. In 10 years, you'll be studied at the wharton school. They'll call it "the Garfield era" and rinse their mouths out! See you in court! Don't leave. We haven't talked about sex yet. At least have a doughnut. Stuff it! Don't be a poor loser! Lying to protect your client is doing a good job! I understand that! You didn't ask what opm means? Other people's money. All right, come on! Get... let's go! Work, work, work! Yes, sir! Gotcha! Oh, yes! How do you have 'em? Two years ago, he tried to take over westridge corporation. He was put under indictment for not disclosing his 13-d. What's this? Your Christmas list. What happened to him? The government dropped charges. Nope. Investors get hurt? If charges were dropped, it's a technicality. He was required to disclose. Gerber's in prison, Richard. Judge pollard ain't going to give you a restraining order based on a technicality. We are a nation of laws, marcia. Ultimately, those laws come down to technicalities. Without those technicalities, what do we have? Anarchy. Garfield. Anarchy? That's the basis for your brief? Correct. Honeybunch, you better write a fantastic brief. I intend to. Want to send anything to Garfield? Yeah. A court order. Oh, do the Japanese celebrate Christmas? No, but I hear they're buying it. Oh... I had nothing to do with any of this! Pfeiffer comes... shh! Temporary restraining order. Thank you very much. Some crew I've got. 17 lawyers on retainer, and you manage to work it out so that in a free market, a so-called free country, I can't buy some shit-ass stock every other asshole can buy. Congratulations. You're destroying the capitalist system. While everybody else in the world is embracing it, my boys and girls are fucking it up! You know what happens when capitalism gets fucked up? The communists come back. They come out of the bushes. Don't kid yourself. They're waiting in there. But maybe that's not so bad. Because you know what happens when the commies take over? The first thing they do is shoot all the lawyers! And if they miss any of you, I'll do it myself! Let's see if we can get this small-town judge to change his fucking mind! Come on! It wasn't me! I was in San Francisco! It was pfeiffer! Mr. Garfield, a miss Sullivan is on the line. Yes. Hello, Lawrence. We're here in the office toasting judge pollard's decision. Stop gloating. It doesn't become you. Don't be a poor loser. I got you on a technicality. Not bad for some broad wet behind the ears. I'd like to talk. I've no time for talk. My days are full. I'll buy you a doughnut. I'm not hungry. Since when do you have to be hungry to have a doughnut? Aw, shut up. Stop pouting. I'll buy you dinner. Name the place. I have a proposition for you. You're trying to seduce me. Heh heh heh heh heh. You have a nice laugh. My house, 8:00. How about lutece? I want to talk to somebody, I go to them. You want to talk, come to me. 8:00. I'll come for 20 minutes. That's all I need. Strictly business. 20 minutes, my place, 8:00. 5:30. 5:30? Funerals are at 5:30. 7:00. 6:00. I got to wash my face. 6:30. Deal. Deal. Harriet! Get me my barber. Get me my manicurist. Call Arthur. She's coming to the house. Ah, miss Sullivan. That's me. Come in. The boss is expecting ya. Thank you. Mr. G.'Ll be right with ya. Thank you. Gloria Taylor. Quarterback's girlfriend. All that putz wanted to do was take her pants off in the backseat, while I was ready to feed her, protect her, put jewels around her neck. I sent her poetry. Longfellow. Can't go wrong with longfellow. "Day by day, I gazed upon her. "Day by day, I sighed with passion. "Day by day, my heart within me grew more hot with love and longing." I gave her hiawatha. All she wanted was a touchdown. Yeah... To the quarterback's girlfriend. To Gloria. Drink, drink. It's the best. You look terrific. Thank you. How about some mushroom dip? I thought this was a business meeting. What's wrong with a little dip? I never met a person so hard to feed. Who are you mad at? Come on, have some dip. Swallow. Mmm. Nice. I think we should talk business. You have an exquisite neck. I have to leave by 7:00. I have another engagement. Oh, right. I forgot. You got a proposition. Thank you. Ahh... Ahh... Shoot. What will it take for you to go away? Greenmail? You're offering to buy me out? Why so uptight? It's not illegal. It's immoral. A distinction that has no relevance for lawyers, but it matters to me. Well, for someone who has nothing nice to say about lawyers, you certainly have plenty of them around. They're like nuclear warheads. They have theirs, so I have mine. Once you use them, they fuck up everything. Let me ask you. Do you have authorization to offer me greenmail? Of course not. It's a lawyer's scheme. Everybody walks out happy. I get paid off. Yorgy keeps his company. The employees keep their yobs. The lawyer gets a big fat fee. Everybody walks out. Yumpin' yiminy. Sounds pretty good to me. Except for the stockholders. Their stock crashes. They don't know what hit them. Now you're Albert schweitzer. Not Albert schweitzer, Robin hood. I take from the rich and give to the middle class. Well, the upper middle class. Care for some caviar? The stock is 18. Do you like music? Let's be serious. Let's change the subject. Arthur! The stock is 18. We'll buy it back at 18. First you laugh at me, then you insult me. Then name your number. 25. The stock hasn't seen 25 in years. The stock was once 60. Take 20. Such a high achiever. If you're mad at somebody, don't take it out on me. 25 and that's a favor. I don't need to be analyzed. Do we have a deal? Let's discuss it over dinner. Your 20 minutes are up. I want to be friends. Let's segue into some soup and French bread. Don't go away mad. I didn't buy your proposition. Come back with another one. You're an emancipated woman. Learn to lose. I haven't lost. Wait, wait! I've got a proposition for you. Hold on, you got to listen. You come on back up. We have a nice dinner. We make passionate love the rest of the night. The first one who comes, loses. Loses what? The deal. I come first, I sell you back my shares at cost. You come first, you buy 'em at 25. I think you're serious. So how do you suggest we write this up? Delicately. Under the heading, "easy come, easy go." What do you got to lose, your virginity? I could lose millions. So what happens if we come together? I never thought of that. Well, think about it, honey. I will. I will. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Come on. Don't go. I haven't played my violin yet. Yeah. While the banks are hemming and hawing as customers borrow money... mmm... Oh, God. Hello? I just want to see if you got home safe. Thank you. In your beddie-bye? I am. Did I wake you? No. No. Heh heh. Did you have dinner? Yes. With who? None of your business. Ha ha. Ha ha. Are you thinking about me? No. How could you manage that? Oh, uh... Pills, whiskey, self-help tapes. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha ha. Hah... I got another proposition for you. Oh, yeah. I can't wait. We swap. Swap what, dirty jokes? Ha ha. No. I give you all my shares. You give me the wire and cable division. Hello? Hello? You like? I'll ask them. Good. All right, now wait. Don't go away. Don't hang up. Stay right where you are. All right. Ha ha ha ha. Here comes the bridge. ¶ Why stop to think of whether ¶ ¶ this little dream might fade? ¶ ¶ let's put our hearts together ¶ ¶ now we are one ¶ ¶ I'm not afraid ¶ Ha ha ha ha. ¶ But for the night forget it ¶ ¶ I'm in the mood for love ¶ huh? Ha ha. That was very good. Thank you. You're welcome. That was just for you. Well, I appreciate it. Sweet dreams. O.K. Good night. Bye-bye. Oh, God. Ohh... Oh. ¶ I'm in the mood for love ¶ forget it. Tell him to go to hell. He spends $13 million for this place, then he sells it for 35, my guys are out of work, and he's made $22 million. How do I live with that? We eliminate a losing division. The other divisions don't have to support us. I don't want to hear that. You still control the company, but without the cable division. Why is it so difficult to understand I can't kill these people and this town to enrich some son of a bitch who's trying to destroy me? I can't play with him in the courts forever. He'll get the injunction lifted and buy more shares. Don't be a pigheaded fool! He deserves to lose this company. Good night, Mr. Jorgenson. Oh, good night, Gus. Everything going along o.K., Mr. Jorgenson? Everything's moving right along, Gus. Everything's going to be o.K., isn't it? At the plant, I mean, the plant and everything. Everything's going to be just fine. We'll be making wire and cable for a long time. Yes, sir. Good night, sir. Good night. Jorgy. Have you got a minute? Sure, bill. Do you mind if I speak frankly to you, jorgy? You always have, haven't you? You know I'm trained to think in contingency. You know I've spent my life managing businesses, and, uh... And... Bill, you're in a panic. Well, you know how it is with business, jorgy, when things don't work out quite right and people have invested their time, their energy, themselves. Management takes care of its own. It happens all the time. And given the uncertainty surrounding us these days and... The fact that you haven't set up any financial guarantees for us, jorgy... Oh, lord, I hate... hate giving this speech. When I retire in two years, I've told you you're taking over the business. I promised you that. There won't be any business in two years, jorgy. There won't be any business in one year. You're holding onto a dream. Go home, bill. Have a drink. Give my best to Jeanette. I don't want the rug pulled out from under me so close to the finish line. Good night. Jorgy, I've been here 15 years. I have a family. Something's due me. I've worked my ass off for 15 years, and you're going to let that man take over the company. It's not right. I'm sorry, bill. Up here we don't plan the funeral until the body is dead. Sounds like everybody's hungry. Well, let's eat. Sit down, darling. Happy Thanksgiving. Happy Thanksgiving. Thank thee, father, for thy care, for thy bounty everywhere. For this and every other gift, our grateful hearts to thee we lift. Amen. 2nd down and 10. Lions at their 49. I don't know why you watch this. It's so stupid. If you watch, you'll see. Yes! Go! Go! Go! I told you. My money was on Detroit. You have to admit we still have fresh air up here. Feels good, all right. I'm awfully glad you came, Kate. It means a hell of a lot to your mother. I love your mother. I can't say I'm sorry for that, but I am sorry for whatever it is it's done to you in the last 21-odd years. I'm o.K., jorgy. Good. Now let's talk a little business. Let's quit talking about what I won't do. Let's talk about what I will do. I have a problem. I'm a good lawyer. I'm a lousy mind reader. I want to put it to a vote. Annual meeting in four weeks. Want to put it in the hands of the stockholders. It's too risky. We could lose everything. You're a fighter. I'm a fighter. Too dangerous. There's no other choice that I can live with. This 30%, this faithful 30%. Can you absolutely count on them? They haven't let me down so far. Awful lot of ozzies on our side. Don't trust ozzie. He's a banker. I have to trust my friends, Kate. This is going to be tough. I have to get Garfield to buy this. He won't want to. It's not to his advantage. Talk nice. Give him your best smile. Come on, Kate. Let's take on the little son of a bitch. Let's kick his ass all the way back to wall street. Yeah. It's a quiet place. I thought it would be a good idea if we calmed down a bit. Do you like Japanese? I'd like to have Sony. Could you bring me a knife and fork, please? Hai. So, what do you say? A proxy fight? I... I'd have to be nuts. I could sit on my ass, wait for the injunction to lift, buy all the shares I need. Anybody else, I wouldn't even come to lunch. You look very nice today. But if you win, Lawrence, it speeds up the process. You get what you want in three months instead of a year, maybe two. I love it when you call me Lawrence. Say it again. There's a lot can stand in your way, Lawrence. Anti-takeover legislation's in the works. Drexel's gone under. Milken's in jail. Trump's waiting tables. Don't threaten me. And just maybe you're overleveraged and you can't afford to wait. Thank you. You got any bread? No bread. No bread. They got no bread. They want to run the world, they got no bread. In three weeks, you present your own slate. If you win, you buy everybody out at 20. If you lose, you sell us back your shares at 15. Worst case scenario... you still make a couple million. Amazing people, the Japanese. We blow the hell out of them. They go back to school, learn English, and start to run the world. What do we do? We get bigheaded, start living the good life, forget about schools. People can't read. People can't write. Country's full of dropouts. Education. Who needs education as long as you can blow up the world? Meanwhile, I got everybody in my office learning Japanese. I've never seen such a beautiful lawyer. Come on, Lawrence. This is your game. Winner takes all. Rumor has it you got balls. I been trying to show you for weeks. Well, here's your opportunity. All right. I can always use a good proxy bloodbath. After all, I want to give you a fighting chance. I love ya. Of course you do... Because we're the same. We are not the same, Lawrence. Now, don't go spreading that around. You know what makes us the same, what sets us apart? We care more about the game than we do the players. Oh, is that so? Yeah... That's so. I'm going to nail you, Lawrence, and everybody on wall street's going to know how some broad did you in. Ooh... You're so perfect for me. I have to go. Don't go. Lunch is on me, babypoo. Where you going? I have to go back to the office. Don't go back to the office. Come and work for me. Lady said to say we have no doughnuts. Here's your coffee, boss. You make me feel like a "doity" crook. Sneaking off to Jersey is not my style. Can we speak frankly? No. Lie to me. Tell me how thrilled you are to know me. I always speak frankly. I hate people who say, "can we speak frankly?" It means they're bullshitting the rest of the time. I'm listening. Now... As you know, I had 60,000 shares of new england stock when we first met. What am I getting, a history lesson here? Get to the point. Since... Becoming aware of your... Investments, I bought an additional 40,000 shares. I now have 100,000 shares. Congratulations. I'm prepared... To sell you the right... To vote those shares at the annual meeting. How much? A million. Too much. You need a million shares more than you already own. Now I can get you 10% of the way there in one transaction. Better still, it's votes they're counting on for themselves. They lose 10%, you gain 10%. If you make a difference, if I win by less than 100,000 votes, you got your million. Otherwise... I don't need them, I won't vote them. I'm not selling you an option. I'm selling the right to vote the shares. If they make a difference, you got a million. If they don't, half a million. I've prepared the papers. Left the numbers blank. You can have your lawyers look at them. Everybody looks out for their own self-interest, don't they? "What's in it for me?" Isn't that what it's finally all about? Yes. Very good. Very good. When do we run in the times? Tomorrow, sir. Times, barrons, Forbes... Boston herald. Next week, major cities in new england. Take this copy and slide it all over to the right. Up in the corner, put that picture of me. You look good in that shot. Oh, God. Look at him. He's trying to look like Desmond tutu. All right, Richard, get our ad agency. Call barbaro. Call pinelli. Barbaro, pinelli. Where's that call from Tokyo? Taxi! Taxi! Thanks, Ron. Mr. Garfield's office. I expect him back at 5:30. Thanks, Connie. I'll ask him to phone you. Bye-bye. Look, I found it. Mrs. Sullivan. She insisted on waiting for you. I would appreciate a few moments of your time. Certainly. Hey, come on in the office. Hold my calls. Will do. Come on in. Have a seat. Did your daughter send you? 'Cause she's full of clever moves, you know. No, she didn't. She'd be upset with me if she knew. I like Kate. She's quite the tomato. She must take after you, huh? You're very kind. I would hope this meeting will be held in confidence. Everybody's looking for confidence these days. You want a cup of coffee? Cup of tea? Glass of water? You needn't be sociable, Mr. Garfield. Harriet, I'll have a cup of coffee. Yes, sir. You mind if I smoke? I'd like to tell you why I'm here. Good. Shoot. I'm here to plead for our company. I want to talk to you about hopes and dreams... Traditions. Would you care for a doughnut, Mrs. Sullivan? We've worked so hard to build this company. We're debt-free, and we don't deserve to lose it. I want you to call off your fight with us. There's a trust fund in my name with $1 million in it. I'll turn it over to you if you go away. You don't want to do that. We'll buy back your shares at cost, plus you'll have $1 million profit. Interesting. I know $1 million isn't much money to you, but if I had more, I'd give it to you. Who are you doing it for? Money's not that important to me. Well, it is to me. Then accept my offer. You'll have more money than most people make in a lifetime. $1 million. It's not enough. Go home, Mrs. Sullivan. I'd hoped to appeal to your sense of decency. I'm sorry. I don't take money from widows or orphans. I make them money. Before or after you put them out of business? Whew! What a woman. Harriet, why do I always bring out the best in people? Hello. Hello. Oh, please. Arthur! Get the car. Arthur. I'm sorry, sir. There's no answer in miss Sullivan's apartment. Well, try it again. Maybe you dialed it wrong. No! It was... um... um, excuse me, Bart. What are you doing here? Who's Bart? I'm on my way out. You should have called. I need to talk to you. I'm late. I need to talk to you now. You look beautiful. Who's this guy? Excuse me, Lawrence. Call tomorrow. I can't talk tomorrow. It won't keep. I want you to marry me. Let me put it another way. I want to marry you. You thinking it over? What are you talking about? What do you mean? I want you to be my wife. We belong together. Katherine. I'm going to the opera. I got to go. You're the last thought I have when I fall asleep at night and the first when I wake up in the morning. I want to be with you forever and ever. I want to have babies with you. Babies? Yeah. You see, I got to do this now because after I win, I wonder maybe you won't ever want to speak to me again. I know how important it is to you, but you're not going to win. It's killing me. I want you. I need you. I love you. I don't want to lose you. Katherine. Keep your pants on. I've got to go. The opera. LA traviata. Don't miss the first act. It sets up the whole thing. It's a wonderful production. Have a good time. I'm going to lose her, Arthur. ¶ Good king wenceslaus looked out ¶ ¶ on the feast of Stephen ¶ ¶ when the snow lay 'round about ¶ ¶ deep and crisp and even ¶ ¶ brightly shone the moon that night ¶ ¶ though the frost was cruel... ¶ oh, I've been looking for you. Anytime you're ready. You o.K.? Yeah. Just going over in my mind what I want to say. They're putting speakers outside. I think every shareholder within driving distance is coming. I feel as if we're Harry and Bess on election night. Harry Truman was a better man than me. He slept on election night. I haven't slept in days. Talk to me. Tell me. I'm scared. I'm scared that... Time has passed us by. I'm scared I don't know this new environment. I'm scared that what I do know doesn't count for anything anymore. Things have changed. Whatever happened to people serving each other? I don't want this man to win. I'm not scared. I'm just proud. I'm proud of the business we've built. I'm so proud of you. And if what we are counts for nothing anymore, then that's their failing, not ours. It'll be all right. Just go out and tell the truth. Go out and give 'em hell, Harry. Good luck to us all today, bill. I feel we're going to be just fine. Looks like they've come from everywhere... New York, Boston. There's ozzie. Happening all over, isn't it? Everybody looking out for themselves. So, did you get your golden parachute, bill? Did he finally promise to take care of you? Lord of the manor, house on the hill. Said he didn't want to talk about a funeral while there was no corpse. Well, time to go. Bill. How are you going to vote? Oh, boy. They're out in droves, Arthur. They got the kids here. Why do they always bring the kids? That's right... hooray, hooray. Down with Garfield. O.K., TV crews. Financial news network, here we come. Mr. Garfield! What are your plans for new england wire and cable? Make the stockholders richer. Will you liquidate new england wire and cable? What about the workers? My obligation is to the stockholders. The board of directors makes that decision. Will they lose their jobs? Come on, answer the question. Come on, Mr. Garfield! How do you feel about the outcome of today's proxy vote? I feel confident that the shareholders will vote their consciences. I'm confident in this company's future. Could I have your attention, please? Welcome to... New england wire and cable's annual stockholders' meeting. I'm William j. Coles, your president... And I'm sure... I'm sure everyone here realizes the most important item on the agenda is... The election of the board of directors. Now, there are staff members passing out the ballots. Right now, I am very proud to introduce to you a man who could accurately be characterized as a legend in the wire and cable industry. The chairman of the board of new england wire and cable, Mr. Andrew jorgenson. Give 'em hell, Andy! It's good to see so many... Familiar faces, so many old friends. Some of you I haven't seen in years. Thank you for coming. Bill coles, our able president, in the annual report has told you of our year, of what we accomplished, of the need for further improvements, our business goals for next year and the years beyond. I'd like to talk to you about something else. I want to share with you some of my thoughts concerning the vote that you're going to make in the company that you own. This proud company, which has survived the death of its founder, numerous recessions, one major depression, and two world wars, is in imminent danger of self-destructing... On this day, in the town of its birth. There is the instrument of our destruction. I want you to look at him in all his glory... Larry the liquidator. The entrepreneur of post-industrial America playing God with other people's money. The robber barons of old at least left something tangible in their wake... a coal mine, a railroad, banks. This man leaves nothing. He creates nothing. He builds nothing. He runs nothing. And in his wake lies nothing but a blizzard of paper to cover the pain. Oh. If he said, "I know how to run your business better than you," that would be something worth talking about. But he's not saying that. He's saying, "I'm going to kill you "because at this particular moment in time, you're worth more dead than alive." Well... Maybe that's true, but it is also true that one day this industry will turn, one day when the yen is weaker, the dollar is stronger, or when we've finally begun to rebuild our roads, our Bridges, the infrastructure of our country, demand will skyrocket. And when those things happen, we will still be here, stronger because of our ordeal, stronger because we have survived. And the price of our stock will make his offer pale by comparison. God save us if we vote to take his paltry few dollars and run. God save this country if that is truly the wave of the future. We will then have become a nation that makes nothing but hamburgers, creates nothing but lawyers, and sells nothing but tax shelters. And if we are at that point in this country where we kill something because at the moment it's worth more dead than alive, well, take a look around. Look at your neighbor. Look at your neighbor. You won't kill him, will you? No. It's called murder, and it's illegal. Well, this, too, is murder on a mass scale. Only on wall street, they call it maximizing shareholder value. And they call it legal. And they substitute dollar bills where a conscience should be. Damn it! A business is worth more than the price of its stock. It's the place where we earn our living, where we meet our friends, dream our dreams. It is, in every sense, the very fabric that binds our society together. So let us now, at this meeting, say to every Garfield in the land, here we build things, we don't destroy them. Here we care about more than the price of our stock. Here... We care about people. Thank you. And now I'd like to introduce. Mr. Lawrence Garfield. Excuse me... please. Let's show a little courtesy, ladies and gentlemen. Mr. Garfield is the president and the chairman of the board of... Garfield investments. Mr. Garfield. No! No! No! Get out of here! Amen. And amen. And amen. You have to forgive me. I'm not familiar with the local custom. Where I come from, you always say amen after you hear a prayer. Because that's what you just heard. A prayer. Where I come from... That particular prayer is called the prayer for the dead. You just heard the prayer for the dead, my fellow stockholders, and you didn't say amen. This company is dead. I didn't kill it. Don't blame me. It was dead when I got here. It's too late for prayers. For even if the prayers were answered and a miracle occurred and the yen did this and the dollar did that and the infrastructure did the other thing, we'd still be dead. You know why? Fiber optics. New technologies. Obsolescence. We're dead, all right. We're just not broke. And do you know the surest way to go broke? Keep getting an increasing share of a shrinking market. Down the tubes. Slow but sure. You know, at one time, there must have been dozens of companies making buggy whips. And I'll bet the last company around was the one that made the best goddamn buggy whip you ever saw. Now, how would you have liked to have been a stockholder in that company? You invested in a business, and this business is dead. Let's have the intelligence, let's have the decency to sign the death certificate, collect the insurance, and invest in something with a future. "Ahh, but we can't," goes the prayer. We can't because we have a responsibility, a responsibility to our employees, to our community. What will happen to them? I got two words for that. Who cares? Care about them? Why? They didn't care about you. They sucked you dry. You have no responsibility to them. For the last 10 years, this company bled your money. Did this community ever say, "we know times are tough... we'll lower taxes, reduce water and sewer"? Check it out. You're paying twice what you did 10 years ago. And our devoted employees who've taken no increases for the past three years are still making twice what they made 10 years ago. And our stock... 1/6 what it was 10 years ago. Who cares? I'll tell you. Me. I'm not your best friend. I'm your only friend. I don't make anything? I'm making you money. And lest we forget, that's the only reason any of you became stockholders in the first place. You want to make money. You don't care if they manufacture wire and cable, fried chicken, or grow tangerines! You want to make money! I'm the only friend you've got. I'm making you money. Take the money. Invest it somewhere else. Maybe... Maybe you'll get lucky, and it'll be used productively. And if it is, you'll create new jobs and provide a service for the economy and, God forbid, even make a few bucks for yourselves. And if anybody asks, tell 'em you gave at the plant. And by the way, it pleases me that I am called. Larry the liquidator. You know why, fellow stockholders? Because at my funeral, you'll leave with a smile on your face and a few bucks in your pocket. Now, that's a funeral worth having. The ballots will be marked and deposited in the ballot boxes at the rear of the hall. Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, please. May I have your attention, please? I will now read the results of the balloting. To retain the present board... 1,741,416. For the opposition... 2,219,901. Not voting... 176,111. Mr. Garfield, your slate is elected. Congratulations, Mr. Garfield. Congratulations, Lawrence. You o.K., boss? You want some chicken soup or something? Mmm. Pie? No. How about some of that carrot cake you like? No. Well, Carmen, we did it again. I can always count on you, can't I? Another barrelful of money. Not bad for a kid from the Bronx. I love money. I love money. Mr. Garfield, Kate Sullivan is on the line. Are you in or out, Mr. Garfield? Hello? You're a greedy, arrogant, self-absorbed, overbearing... avaricious? I have a proposition for you. Are you ready, Lawrence? Ready. Air bags. Air bags? Every car in America is about to have one. Did you know that air bags are made from stainless steel wire cloth? Did you dump Bart? The mitsushimi company of Japan is ready to make a long-term deal with new england wire and cable for the production of... Air bags. I love the sound of your voice. Well, here comes the best part, Lawrence. You sell wire and cable back to the employees, they modernize and re-equip the plant and turn out air bags. What's in it for me? They'll pay 28 bucks a share. You like? They'll go to 30. 30? You think so? Why not? We'll discuss it at dinner... see you in an hour. Lunch. Tomorrow. 1:00. You know where. Strictly business. Oh, yeah, yeah. Strictly business. Wow! Did you hear that, Carmen? Harriet! Call my manicurist, call the barber, call the florist, tell Arthur I want two tickets to the opera tomorrow night. Puccini. We're back in business! Whoo-hoo! It's money that I love. Captioning made possible by Warner bros., inc. Captioning performed by the national captioning institute, inc.
