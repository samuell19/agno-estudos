Real estate isn't about buildings, ladies. It's about people. Now, I turned a one man real estate office, into a major enterprise. First, by believing in myself. And then, by believing in my clients. Now, each and every one of you can do exactly the same thing. But it doesn't start here. It starts here. -Mmm. -He's got that right. -Yeah. I know what he means by that. I wish, for each of you, all the success your heart's desire. And all the energy that it's gonna take to achieve it. So, go for it. That's it. Goodbye. Thank you. -Would anybody like a coffee? -Oh, absolutely. -Oh. -Oh, sorry. Thank you. -Well, that's very good. -Oh, my handwriting is... So, what kind of business are you planning to start? Oh, I'm not starting one. -I inherited a beauty salon from my great aunt. -Oh. Well, I hope I can remember all of this. Mr. Mitchell? Are you going to be giving any other seminars? No, I'm sorry. My business takes up much of my time. You must be very busy. Well I'm not too busy to have dinner, once in a while. Are you? Ah, no. I eat dinner. I mean, of course I eat dinner. I mean, I can go out for dinner. You were asking me out, weren't you? Yes, I was. I most certainly was. Hello, I have a delivery for a Miss... -Cassie Robbins. -Cassie Robbins. -Cassie Robbins. Oh Cassie? -You must be Cassie Robbins. -Yes I am. (PEOPLE HUMMING " HERE COMES THE BRIDE ") Every week for six weeks? -This seems to be getting serious! -And expensive! Cassie's got herself a steady beau. A beau? A stud! Look at the size of that arrangement! But he's pretty nice too though, isn't he, Cassie? This car is so much money. We want this one. You already have a car. It's a jaguar it's always in this shop. Back forth, back forth. No, this one's for you. Well, Harris. I don't need a fancy car. Well, only the best for my wife. What? Well, you do want to be my wife, don't you? You're gonna make me work for it, aren't you? -Miss Cassie Robbins. -Mhm. Will you marry me? Yes. Yes, of course I'll marry you. Well, let me be the first to congratulate you on a fine choice. In both women and cars. Steve Bromely. Harris Mitchell. What's the delivery on these, Steve. Oh, that all depends. -Well how about...a white convertible? -Oh! -Automatic? -Okay. -CD player, alarm system? -Okay, Okay! There convertible's our most popular model! I'll figure at least four to eight weeks, though. What's the matter? Look, we have to go now. I have a closing on a major shopping center in a half hour, I can't be late. We'll check in with you later, Steve. To sign the paperwork, alright? I'll probably be tied up for the next few days. Sometimes, these closings can turn into marathon torture sessions. -Miss you. -Miss you too. -You're sure that you don't need the car? -Positive. Okay. Oh, I've got something for you. Oh, Harris, you've given me so much already. It was my great grandmothers. In our family, we give this instead of an engagement ring. Oh, Harris. It's beautiful. Will you wear it on our wedding day? Of course I will. I better get out of here or else I'm gonna stay here all day with you. -I got lipstick all over you. -That's alright. -Okay, I'll see you soon. -Okay. Damn, I forgot to stop at the bank. It's closed now. I don't know why you don't use the automatic teller machine. Because they're impersonal, they actually put people out of work. -And the cards can be stolen. -Because you're old fashioned. Maybe. Look, if you don't have enough cash why don't you just borrow my card. I have plenty of cash at the shop. No, I couldn't compromise my integrity, like that. However, given no alternative. -Thank you. -As long as you're going to compromise your integrity, would you mind making a deposit for me? Yeah. -Okay, bye. -Bye. I'm available, but I'm not easy. I see myself as a poet. Not that I write. I expect a man to be my slave. Physically and emotionally. I'm 39 going on 40. Maybe I shouldn't be telling you this. Oh, what difference does it make? I certainly don't look any younger. Not that I look any older! I'm... I'm a very loving, giving, trusting, person. I'm a travel agent and I get to go on free trips. So, pick me and win a fun-filled trip for two to sunny Puerto Vallarta! -Oh, it's all wrong! -Yeah, you're right. Well, is he worth it? He sounds perfect. Warm, bright, charming. -Mom! -Oh, I know it was only a phone conversation, but... His voice sounded very convincing and sincere. What do you think? Very alluring, mom. Just remember, no heavy petting on the first date. Marcy. Oh my god. I'll get it. Mom, you're gonna dazzle this guy. What's his name? Kevin... Blanchard. Kevin Blanchard. Dealing in antiques is more than buying and selling precious objects. What excites me is the hunt. The search for something of exquisite quality. That'll be of great value to just the right person. You're so passionate about your work, Kevin. -I can really admire that. -Passion is important. In everything. Would you tell me about your work now. What can I possibly tell you about travel. You seem to have been everywhere. What's your favorite place? (SPEAKING ITALIAN) See, I've never even heard of it. It's understandable. It's a small little island. Just south of St. Tropez. There's no cars. Just bicycles. You know what I like about it? It's like stepping back in time. That sounds wonderful. Oh, it is. I'd love to take you there sometime. This is the way rich people eat. Perhaps, that's why so many of them are so thin. Our little Cassie. Marrying into royalty. They're not royalty. Well, practically. You'll be one of the Mitchells of New Canaan. Have you met them yet? No, I don't think I'll be meeting them until they fly down from New Canaan. My first society wedding. I wish I had a tiara or, something. I hear Tiffany's is having a two for one sale. No, No. Harris doesn't want anything fancy. He's made all the arrangement. And he wants to keep it elegant but simple. People with old money have such class. (KNOCKING) Just a minute. -Harris! -Hello beautiful. Oh, I wasn't expecting you! I finished my business much sooner than I thought. -How was Dallas? -Very dull without you. Here, come on in. What's all this? My friends through me a wedding shower today. Well, like I said, very dull without you, darling. Wait a minute, let me just put this stuff away. Where do I start? So, how was the party? Oh, it was great. We had lots of fun, lots of dirty jokes. Lots of presents. -I've got some good news. -What is it? I found a buyer for the beauty salon, today. What's the matter? Oh, I don't know. The more I think about it, I'm not so sure about selling it, you know what I mean? A lot of those women have been there for 40 years. Well, your property is worth a small fortune. It might not be later, and you know? That's how real estate works, in cycles. I just don't think I should sell it. You just need some time to get used to the idea, that's all. Hey, hey. Oh, I missed that. Oh, did you remember to bring back my bankcard? Oh, I'm sorry I left it in my briefcase again. That's alright. It's just that, we got a few wedding checks from my family in the mail. They want me to deposit them. Well, that's very nice of them. Come here. Well, don't get too excited. It's only a few hundred dollars. Which, for you must be like nothing at all. But for my family, it's considered very serious money. No, It's a lot of money. They're obviously very fond of you. I wish they could all be here for the wedding. Me too. -I've got a good idea. -What? Why don't I just take these checks and start a joint account. And whenever we use it, we'll say a little prayer for your family. That's a wonderful idea. Bye darling, I'm off to work. Hello beautiful. You haven't forgotten our lunch date, have you? No, I've been waiting for your call. 1:30 is fine, where? You're too extravagant. I'll be there. Bye. -Oh Martin, hi! -Hi, Vivien. Listen, I've been working on your itinerary. But it won't be ready... -It's all taken care of. -What do you mean? Oh, I stopped in last night when you were out. -Was that wrong of me? -No, of course not. We work as a team here. Well, it looks like everything's in order. Thank you both. -Our pleasure. -Our pleasure. I just lost a $300 commission. How did that Roger Kimberly ever get to be managing editor? Oh, I'd just like to take him in my arms and... Spare me the details, would you look at this? Single forever, the saga of the 80's woman. Read it and weep. A woman, at 40, is more likely to get shot by a terrorist than to get married. Well, I can see where that might be preferable. This is not a laughing matter. Uh oh, what's wrong? This. This is what's wrong. This article reads like the story of my life. Listen to this, a single, 35 year old, college educated female. Only has a 5% chance of ever getting married. I expected to see my picture in the margin. Oh, and at 40, it goes down to 2.6%. So who's planning to be 40? -Seriously. -Seriously. These studies are ridiculous. I'm sure it was the brilliant idea of some guy who couldn't get a date. Maybe. But, my personal life is still the pits. All work and no play. I know, I know. So, what do I do? I mean, you work hard and still date. Everything in pants. Meow, dear. Well. Wait a minute, I've got it. Have you tried the personals? Maybe you'd get a company discount. Touche. (DIALING NUMBER) (RINGING) -Hello? -Hello. Is this Michael Sumner? -Yes, it is. -Hi. This is Jenny Barron. -I placed an ad in the personals. -Ah. I received you letter. Yes, I was hoping that you'd call. I was wondering if we could get together? Right, the attractive, young professional woman. Well, hello, Jenny. Who do you love? What was that? I didn't mean to be forward, I meant, which author do you admire. Oh. Here. Let's see. Now this, this in unequivocally worth reading. You won't believe, but I... I have always loved Russian poetry. That's amazing. I've never met anyone before that I could share this with. Neither have I. The raw emotion of Akhmatova. Maybe they have Requiem and a Poem Without a Hero , I dunno. I lost my copy of it. Yes, he's quite good. She. Anna Akhmatova. Oh, I thought you said Alex Maheova. I've never heard of him. He's some obscure defector poet in Paris who's published only in journals. I see, I'm not familiar with the newest wave. Oh, don't worry. Most people haven't heard of Akhmatova. Just follow the path, right down to the restaurant. -I'm sure you know the way Mr... -Yes, thank you. Have a wonderful lunch. Thank you. You know you're a rare person. Giving up what people strive for. A lifetime to achieve, to follow your dreams. Well, I had reached a dead end. All I wanted to do when I was at Princeton, was to finish my novel. Then, suddenly, albeit it twenty years later. I decided I had to take control. I had to find the time. I just stopped blaming others. So I gave up the bulk of my estate to various charities. And I tied up the rest in CD's and bonds. You gave up? Oh... It was just too easy finding excuses not to write. So. Now, not only do I write from the deep passion to create. But also, a burning motivation to sell it so I can eat. I would love to read some of it. No, I couldn't do that. Why? Well, because you're an editor you're trained to be critical. What if you hated it? I strongly suspect that I won't. Maybe. Sorry this has been such a cheap date. I hope you don't mind. Mind? This has been wonderful. I mean, here we are. In this beautiful place. On this beautiful day, it's... Well, being poor does have its compensations. Oh, mama! It's beautiful. Oh, I can't wait to look at it. -Look at you. -Oh, my gosh. It's so long. I was hoping to meet Harris before the wedding. Oh, I know mama. We still have a few days. It's just that he's so busy. And his real estate projects take him all over the country. Well, success is very nice but, family should be top priority. What do you think? It's like looking at myself on my wedding day. Your dad, would have been so proud. Oh, I know, mama. I miss him too. Come on, this is supposed to be your happy time. Oh, look at this dress. Let's see that antique watch, you're always talking about. Well, it was right here. Where is it? What did I do with it? We hardly know him and now he's moving in. Stop exaggerating, it's only a few things. Why are you acting this way? I've never been happier. I just think it's too fast. Remember when I dreamed about going out with Jeremy? And then he asked me to the dance? And he got drunk and he threw up all night? Don't remind me. The point is, I didn't know him, mom. I had a crush on a fantasy, not on him. Honey, it's not the same thing. I hope not. Are you planning to marry him? Well, we haven't set a date or anything. But... He did give me this. As an engagement present. I'd have it appraised. Poor baby. I can't believe he stood her up. I've checked everywhere, no luck. Maybe he's dead. Well he'd better be, or I'll kill him. -Guess who? -I have no idea. A prospective traveler. And where would you like to go, sir? Someplace hot. Vivien? I'd like to see you in my office, please. I'll be right back. Hello? Boy, give somebody a little bit of power. -What's the matter? -Nothing a mussel wouldn't cure. I didn't expect to see you here. What time are you getting off work tonight? -Ten. -Ohhh. What are you doing tonight? I was hoping to have dinner with you. -At the Harvest. -Oh, I wish I could. Me too. Well, some other time. Vivien. I had better be going. -Good evening. Cafe or dining room? -Hi. -I have a reservations for two in the cafe, Michael Sumner. -Ah, yes of course. -Kevin. -What? A surprise! I thought that you had to work tonight. Oh, my manager gave me time off for dinner, nice of him, eh? Ah, the dining room. We're in a bit of a hurry. -Certainly, Mr... -Blanchard! Great, now I don't have to eat alone. -Can we have that table over there? -Whichever you prefer, sir. -Why don't you sit over here. -Okay. Thank you. I'll send a waiter, right over. -Enjoy your dinner. -Thank you. Gee, I'm sorry I have to a phone call. A client of mine was supposed to receive a Louis the XV clock, from France today. Hasn't arrived yet. Believe me she's more than a little upset. It's worth over 11 thousand dollars. Well I could understand why she's upset. Good evening, could I get you something to drink, while you're looking at the menus. Do you mind ordering for me? -What do you want? -Surprise me. Here I am. Sorry I'm late. I was just calling you, I thought something had happened. A dull editorial meeting. Oh, I'm starved. Look, this place is kind of cheesy, isn't it? -Let's go somewhere else. -Oh, I think it's charming and I've really been looking forward to eating here. -Well I think the cafe... -Yes, I think so too. -Right this way Mr... -Sumner. -Uh huh. Here we are. Should I take the gentlemen's food back and keep it warm? -Oh here he is. -Excuse me. Thank you. I'm sorry. The clock never arrived. Are you responsible? She seems to think so. She's trying to get me go to the airport with her. Tonight? I hope not. This looks delicious, what is it? Fettuccini Pernova. -Oh, the food's great. -Thank you. Well, I'm expecting a phone call from the overseas operator. It should just take a moment. So he's got one woman in the dining room, he comes out for a phone call, there's another -woman standing there! So I sit them in the cafe. -Shhh. I don't believe it. Just trying to make a call, I didn't have a quarter and I was looking for some change. And I ran into this perfectly awful woman I had to fire a few years ago... who had embezzled some money from one of my trust accounts. -How terrible. -She's obviously been holding a grudge all these years. She absolutely refuses to take any responsibility for her actions. Oh! Some people are so good at lying to themselves. Huh! Isn't that the truth? This is filthy! Oh this isn't what I ordered. Waiter! Ahh, I don't believe this place. I guess you were right, Michael. Would you like to go? No, no, not if you don't. WAITER: Here you are. -What is this? -It's the same thing you or... -I was speaking to the lady. Excuse me. I was afraid that we would miss our movie so I went ahead and ordered dinner. -It's a fettuccine pernod. -Pernod? Oh. Well, bon appetit! This is awful. -I'm sorry. -Oh, it's not your fault. Yes it is. Now let's go. And please, it's on me. Otherwise I'd feel really awful about having made you eat here. -No, no, I couldn't. I couldn't. -No, I insist. Well... Let me borrow one of these quarters and I'll make a quick call while you're taking care of the bill. Thanks. -WOMAN: Excuse me. -Thank you! (SIGHS) This is terrible. I'm sorry. At least we've traced it to New York. Or London. Please, start without me. Excuse me, but I have to complain. The silverware was dirty, the wrong drink was served... -That's what he ordered! -Ted! Please. It's all right, Jenny. Thank you. No, no it isn't. And my companion's food was very bad-tasting. Well I'm very sorry, ma'am. Thank you very much. Thanks. Oh my God, excuse me! -Uh... -What is going on? It's the lady with the missing clock. She just drove here. She's very upset. I think I should get her out of here before she makes a complete spectacle of herself. I hope you don't mind. No. No, of course not. Miss, could you leave him alone? -What? -You see? I think I'd better get her out of here right now. Yeah, by all means. Can I help you out with the check? Oh no no, of course not. Just go take care of it. Thank you for being so understanding. Thank you for being so understanding. Can I talk to you? Sure. What? Cassie. It's been long enough. He's not coming back. He is. I know he is. Cassie. I decided to wait to tell you this because I didn't think you could handle it. -It's time you knew the truth. -What are you talking about? There were no plans for the wedding. The Arch Bishop had no idea who Harris Mitchell was. -The caterer was doing a bar mitzvah in Hillcrest that day. -That's not possible. That's not possible! Excuse me. May I help you? Yes, hi, I'm Cassie Robbins. I was here about a month ago with my fiancee. Come with me, please. -You are never to enter my store again. -What? We don't consort with thieves here. You may leave through the back entrance. Please! There must be some mistake. I... My fiancee is missing. Well aren't you fortunate. -I don't understand. I saw him give you the check. -Yes, but it wasn't his. What do you mean? He endorsed a check made out to cash, from his aunt, supposedly. -From his aunt? -Really doesn't matter because the account was closed. Now if you'll just leave, I have legitimate clients to attend to. Oh, I don't understand. I don't understand. -You really are better off without him. -What? Look I... Do you still have the check? I don't know if I should trust you or not. Vivien Langford? (DOORBELL RINGS) -Hi. -I'm looking for Vivien Langford. I'm Vivien Langford. I'm Cassie Robbins. I'd like to talk to you about your nephew. What nephew? Harris Mitchell. I never heard of him. Sorry. Oh excuse me, um, I think you have. A psychiatrist? Well I as gullible enough to believe it. And I majored in psychology in college. Oh...he was smooth. He was kinda like an animal stalking his prey. He knew exactly the right kind of bait to use. How do you mean? Well...there I was. A bereaved widow at a fundraising dinner. Vulnerable, with money. I even suggested a couple of sessions with him to help me through my bereavement. He looked deep into my eyes and he said, "That's impossible." And I said, "Why?" He said... "Because I never date my patients." Smooth. Well I don't think it's the same man. Well then why did he endorse my check and give it to your caterer? Well, she'd obviously made a mistake. Heh. Oh, Cassie. Cassie, I know just how you feel. Denial is the first stage. And then anger, and uh... then acceptance, and then finally, you get to the stage I'm at... the desire for revenge. I'm sorry, but I just don't see how the man that I know would be interested in dating a woman... A woman twice your age? Do you know I used to think... some men found older women attractive. Then I met Larry Hogan... and I agree with you. Now I can't believe any man who says "hello" to me is after anything but my money. Oh, forgive me. You're a very attractive woman. Yeah. Thanks. I have a picture of him. Would you like to see it? I periodically... stick thumbtacks in it. It's him. That bastard. Look... It's gonna get better. I don't want to hear this right now. He'll come back, he'll explain everything to me... No he won't. Yes he will. Excuse me. I don't know you very well, but I do know him. No, you, you don't know him. You know a character he's playing this month. No I know him. No he's not...perfect. Everybody makes mistakes. But he's taught me things, and he's... put confidence in me. He even gave me advice about my business. What kind of advice? Did he ask you to sell it? And what did he want from you in return for this wonderful advice? Some cash? A car? Vivien: Your bankcard? I'm afraid you got the short end of the deal. Just like I did. BETTY ANN: (GASPS HAPPILY) Just a hint! Would you read my lips? No. -It's okay, you don't have to make a big fuss. -Okay. It's only a birthday. Even if it is this birthday. (SIGHS) Forty. Oh God, I said it out loud and it sounds awful. Well it looks great... on you. -Thank you. -You're welcome. -(GIGGLES) -Special year. Mm hmm. Special lady. Special surprise. Oh, really? What? Okay, I shouldn't ask. -You shouldn't have. -Well then I'll just have to take them back. Them? Is it earrings? -Bookends? -What? Tickets! No, you know I can get those at the agency. Unless, it's tickets for a show. (EXCITEDLY) Ahhhh! That's it! It's tickets for a show, that's it! I'll never divulge my secret. Kevin! Now what? (SHOWER TURNING ON) Yes! KEVIN: What are you doing? Nothing. I was just...looking for my birthday present. Well you don't want to ruin my surprise, do you? What did you see? Nothing. Sorry. No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. Honey, I've been working very hard... to make this a very special birthday for you. 'Kay? KEVIN: Oh, I'm sorry. You know, you're a very good cook. Yeah, if you like cold food. -Well it depends on the reason it got cold. -(CHUCKLES) JENNY: (CLEARS HER THROAT) Thank you. By the way, how's your writing going? -What's wrong? -Ah, it's not worth talkin' about. Of course it is. Michael, share it with me. All right. Here. (SIGHS) You asked for it. (SIGHS) I'm thinking of giving up my writing. What? I had to pay for gas today with my penny change. Well, if it's just money that's the problem, I can lend you some. No, I couldn't let you do that. What are you, kidding? -Why? Your writing's important to you. -Well... -And you should continue doing it. -(SIGHS) And it's important to me to be able to help you. You do help me. You inspire me. Yeah, well that isn't enough. Let me do something practical. No. Please? Please? Please? All right, all right, all right! All right! Thank you. How'd I get so lucky to meet someone like you? (SIGHS) Thank you. Thank you. Just dedicate your book to me. (LAUGHS) My life to you. I suddenly see what you're up to. What? You are using me as an excuse not to write. (LAUGHING) -Oh gosh, I've been found out, I see. -(LAUGHS) -Well, as your patron... -Mm hmm... ...just uh... -let me make one request. -Mm hmm. Take me out to your beach cottage? It sounds so perfect. I could make a picnic lunch. It'd be a nice break for you. Oh, I know how hard you work. LANDLADY: Larry Hogan? Mrs. McNally. Now there seems to be a wee problem here. Tell it to the leprechauns, Larry Hogan. I'm deaf until I get my six months' rent. -Mrs. McNally? -I don't hear you. Mrs. McNally! I have the money. That's a thousand. Good. -Then perhaps you could... -Now you only owe me for one month. -Mrs. McNally. -(SINGING) -Mrs. Mc... Kevin? You say you gave him the keys? Yes, but I didn't give him permission to steal from me. In my humble opinion, a domestic squabble is generally the fault of two people. This was not a domestic squabble. Well he's probably off on a bender somewhere tryin' to hawk the stuff. -He's not a drinker. -Well you didn't think he was a thief, either. I beg your pardon? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Uh, can I have a look around, please? Sure. Where's the jewelry? Here. And uh, you see he's taken all his clothes. Uh-huh. Look at this. What does that prove? Well maybe she's one of the women whose credit cards he had in his wallet? Sounds like a very popular guy. Aren't you gonna do anything about this? Yeah, I'll run a check on him. Uh... I'd think about changing the locks. That is, of course, unless you want him back. Ciao. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hello, beautiful. Can I come in? I can understand if you don't want me to. Please? Okay. There's no decent excuse for what I did, so I'll just uh... (SIGHS) I'll just have to tell you the truth. I got cold feet, I panicked. I got into your car and I don't know, I just drove. -Why? -Why? I guess maybe the idea of losing my freedom. You know, 'till death do us part. I'm not proud of my behavior. But that's the truth. I'm sorry. So what are you doing here now? Well at first, I felt like a schoolboy playing hooky, you know? And then, after a few weeks, it was like... It was like a great part of me was missing. I realized how irrational my fears had been and uh... how much I wanted you... needed you. I don't know. I don't know. Harris. Is that your name, Harris? What do you mean? I met Vivien Langford. What did she say? No please, don't tell me. I can guess. Something about me being a psychiatrist? Yeah. She also said she was your lover. (SCOFFS) That's funny. Well you didn't believe her, did ya? I mean that woman is definitely suffering from very serious delusions. What about the check you gave the caterer for our wedding? What about it? -Oh no, did it bounce? -Yeah. (SIGHS) I should have known. Here I was, supposedly helping out a lonely widow. I lent Vivien money, you see. Because she claimed that her finances were still legally tied up and that check was a small repayment for that loan. How stupid can I get? She had no intention of paying me back. But you know, despite all that she said about me, I really feel sorry for her. Oh, I forgot. I have something for you. (WHISPERING) Take it. (GASPS SADLY) The clasp was broken. I had it repaired for you. RECEPTIONIST: This Tuesday at 9:15. Okay. Bye. Cassie. -Cassie Robbins, Betty Ann Brennan. -Hi. Hi. Cassie, you're not gonna believe this. Betty Ann has had a similar encounter with you-know-who. Could we go someplace and talk? Oh, I really don't think this is a good idea. I'm really busy. Oh please, it has to be now. For all we know, he could be halfway out of town. I don't owe you any details. Harris Mitchell is a good, honest, and forgiving man. -Good? -Honest? Cassie, what about everything...he took from you? He gave it all back. My car, my bank card, and my engagement ring. -You saw him. -Well of course I saw him. It's a trick. He's up to something. Can't you see that? Look, I really think you both should be going, right now. Vivien: Cassie... Cassie, Betty Ann is right. If he's come back, he's after something. Oh... Cassie, are you having a problem here? No, these ladies were just leaving. Just leaving. Here it is, home sweet home. JENNY: Oh, it's a dream. Come on. Ohh! JENNY: It's even lovelier than you described. Talk about inspiration. Where's your computer? Uh, I hid it. Why? Because I didn't want any distractions today. -Oh. -Here. What's this? Read it. -Three days in La Somata and St. Maarten? -Mm hmm. I figured with winter looming ahead, we'll have something to look forward to. What's the matter? Well, don't get me wrong, I'm thrilled. But, I mean, how can you afford this? Ah well... (CLEARS THROAT) Well what did you do? (SIGHS) I sold my car. You didn't? Yeah, it started to need a lot of repairs. I would have had to sink more money into it than it was worth. So... Well, but how are you going to get around? -No. -Oh seriously, there's public transportation. You can borrow my car when you need it. You've done so much for me already. Mmm... Think about what you've done for me. Yeah, the horizontal shot will be just wonderful. Great, thanks, bye. Whatever you're on, don't give me any of it. What I'm on doesn't come in a bottle. ELLIE: But, it's just as dangerous. Ellie, you wouldn't by any chance happen to be jealous of my relationship with Michael, -would you? -No, concerned would be a better word. The half-smile, the flushed cheeks, the glazed expression... We humans call it love. We realists call it infatuation. -Oh, what would you know? -I know all the signs, all the symptoms. Believe me, when you settle down and start walking on two feet with that guy, then I'll be jealous. -But, I won't admit it. -(LAUGHS) (KNOCKS ON DOOR) Surprise! Sorry, this isn't an open house. It's by appointment only. -Pardon me? -Are you here to see the house? Uh, I'm here to see Michael. Oh, you lost me, dear. Excuse me, Michael Sumner, he lives here? MAN: I thought you said no one was living here. WOMAN: Yes, we told you that we needed the place... Please. This young lady has been misinformed. No one has lived here for two months. I was with him here last week. An attractive gentleman? Smooth talker? I guess. Of course, it must be the same man. I was kind enough to give him the keys to the cottage, for a day... which is not my usual practice. But he said he was a writer, and the place had to feel right for him. And all that artsy stuff. So, he conned me out of a day's rental free. Can you believe that? And then not a word from him. He didn't even return the key. (DIALING A NUMBER) He must've taken these right off my desk. (LAUGHS) Just after he kissed me. I feel like such a jerk. So do I. Me of all people. I mean, I write articles about men like him. And when I think about yelling at you at that restaurant, I am so embarrassed. Forget it. Look, we all acted like fools. He's a very good liar. We still should've seen the signs. BETTY ANN: How? Oh, he was so convincing. I can still hear that sincere voice. JENNY AND BETTY ANN: Hello, beautiful. (LAUGHING) God, he didn't even bother to change his dialogue. He didn't even bother to take the old checks and credit cards out of his wallet. They were his trophies. They made him feel more like a stud. He wasn't even that good. He wasn't that bad, either. Oh, the special oils from India. The back of your knees? No, my toes. -Inner thighs. -(LAUGHS) Multi-talented. I feel so violated by that rat. -Slimy... -Look ladies, we can do better than name calling here. We can stop him in his tracks. How? How? (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) What do you want? CASSIE: Oh, I almost forgot. Betty Ann also told me that you had given her a diamond watch for her engagement present. Yeah, is that just about everything? That's it. That's all you're gonna say? I'm waiting to hear what you have to say. Okay. I have never met this Betty Ann, or, what's her name? Jenny. They described you! Vivien obviously has tutored them very well. Listen to me. There are a lot of lonely, sick women in this world who unfortunately have been hurt by men, and they feel this need to strike back at a man, any man, and Vivien is one of them. How did Betty Ann know about the watch? If you think about it, you have told Vivien the whole story. You know, I am getting very tired of having to continually defend myself here. Maybe it's a good thing that we haven't gotten married yet. I think I better go. Harris, wait! Wait! Harris, it's just that I... Just... I miss you. Here we were, planning a life together, and you choose to believe three strangers. -But... -Ah, there's no buts about it. Harris, wait! It's just that I... I feel so insecure without you, and... I mean, I didn't even know how to run the clip joint until I met you, and... ...it's just I have to trust. Trust. I will. I don't know, Cassie. Look, I'll, uh... I'll tell Vivien to stop bothering me, and if she doesn't, I'll call the police! No. Why? 'Cause I want to know what these women are up to. This morning I realized I couldn't pretend any longer. Cassie, I'm so proud of you. So. What do I do now? Keep seeing him. Well, I don't think that's such a good idea. As soon as we get the evidence we need to have him arrested at least we'll know where he is. She's right. Cassie, you don't have to do any of this if you don't want to. Oh no, it's fine. Whatever you all think is best. He's not here. Well, I'm sorry, ladies, that's it. Now what? Hey, Leonard. Just go home and forget about him. Detective! We're not going to give up so easily. Look. Why don't you just chalk it up to experience and move on. Because he's moving on. On to his next victim. All right. All right, here's what you gotta do. You've gotta go back, and reconstruct your stories in detail. I need names, I need dates. People who saw both of you together. Credit card slips. Uh. Basically anything that links him to the four of you. When you've got all that, you come back in, I'll have you all fill out affidavits. Then you can arrest him? No. No, that's just the beginning. Then I take it to the assistant DA to see if we even have a case. I made a list of all the places he might have frequented, like banks, florists... Well, look, we'll split into teams and we'll check 'em out. -Great. -Okay. All right. You know, I can't find all my bank statements and credit card receipts. Neither can I! The rat probably took them. You know I'm out almost $6,000 because of this guy. I guess he took pity on me. I'm only out $1,500. Well, I'm out more than both of you put together. Ooh. Cassie, were you able to find the records of your banking transactions? Oh, well I've had to be very careful. I mean, I don't want Harris, or whatever his name is, to become suspicious. Right. Keep the rat in the trap. No offense. -Look, I found something that might be useful. -What is it? It's a gift certificate he gave me, it's invalid of course, but it's from a dress shop in Bay City. Oh. Here now, let me do the talking. We don't want to scare her off. -All right? -Fine. All right. Can I be of assistance? Yes, um... Can you tell me if you've ever seen this man? No. I'm sorry, I can't help you. Oh, please. Could you talk with us just for a few minutes? What is it? What do you want from me? We're trying to gather enough evidence to have him put away. Your testimony could strengthen the case. I have no testimony. Look, we wanna stop him from hurting other women the way he's hurt all of us. Don't you care about that? The only thing I care about at this point is protecting what precious little remains of my self-respect. I spent years of unhappiness getting over that experience, I won't go back to it now. Well, I don't think you're over it yet. Or you wouldn't react like this. Maybe putting him away would be the healthiest thing you could do for yourself. Don't presume to analyze me, Miss. I'll handle my personal affairs the way I deem appropriate. And making a public laughing stock of myself with a bunch of other foolish women is not appropriate for me. If you want to expose your private life, go ahead. But mine is just that. Private. Good day. I'm sorry. I can't. So what do you think, do we have a case? Fraud, possibly. Here's the situation. In addition to Cassie Robbins' bank information, I'm lacking crucial evidence from you ladies. We all have papers missing, and we think he stole them. Do you have proof of that? No. Well, keep looking for anything incriminating. I need as much hard evidence as possible to get an arrest warrant. Where's Cassie Robbins' affidavit? She hasn't brought it in yet. And I haven't been able to get her on the phone. Neither have I. I'm afraid she's avoiding us. Well, I can subpoena her, but I can't put words in her mouth. My concern is that Larry Hogan can. Try to talk to her, ladies. Divided, you fall. Well, at least we know where to find him, when we want him. But I still don't understand how she could do it. Maybe she's just putting on a good act? No, I should've seen it coming. Well, there's gotta be some way to get through to her. If only she could see him in action, you know? Not just hear a secondhand report, but actually see him operating. What if we could show Cassie the truth? And have some fun with him at the same time? -I love it. -Yeah. Oh, now we're not going to indulge our revenge fantasies again, are we? Well, why does it have to remain fantasies? I agree. I agree! Let's admit it, revenge is important to us. I mean, no one knows except us what he did. And no one understands that he took the one thing from us that we can't list on a police report. Our pride. And we know what we need to do to get some of it back. We're not talking about taking the law into our own hands, here, are we? No, we're talking about using the same law that Hogan used on us. The law of natural attraction. What was the name of that video dating service that you used? "Love Is Not Blind." Maybe not. But greed is. Well, what do you think? I think an Yves Saint Laurent original wouldn't make a difference. She's all wrong. He goes for... ...coy. Look, will ya leave it to me? I got a couple of charms that I can show him. I don't need expensive things. Maybe because I could never afford them. My idea of a good time is a walk in the park or a visit to the library. (FAST-FORWARDING SOUNDS) I suppose my Mom and Daddy wouldn't approve of this. Not the thing for a former debutante to do. But I have to make my own decisions now, and... ...well, I've decided to meet more people. A life of privilege can be too confining. I didn't even want to come here tonight. But I thought I should tell you something in person. Cassie, before you say anything, there's something that... well, we would like you to see. Are you all right? We didn't know how else to show you what a creep he really is. But he told me he was out of town on business... I even put the clip joint up for sale again. I'm so embarrassed. Stop that, this is not your fault. So it took you a little longer to see the truth. It doesn't matter. What matters is that we put him behind bars so that he can't do this again. Do what you want to do! Listen, Cassie, we're so close, we've almost got him! -I don't want to have anything to do with this. -Cassie! Well! Now what? We'll just have to get the evidence without her. How? I've got an idea that involves our little mint julep down there. Oh! You're the journalist? -Yes. -Please come in. Thank you. Thank you for taking the time to see me. Time? That's all I have, dearie. Let's sit down. Now. You want to know how the Glen District has changed. Don't worry. Ellie will keep Hogan busy for hours. It's here! I can't tell you how much these cost. It's two from the rib. One of those he said should work. I hope so! Quiet! BOTH: It's not mine. Oh my God. They're mine! Oh! Fabulous! This is it! And then, when I was six... or maybe it was five... ...well, we moved into this building. Who goes there? Oh, please excuse me, dearie. Oh, it's you! Good day, Mrs. McNally. I'm not speaking to you except to tell you that I have a postal package for you. Oh! (SOUTHERN ACCENT) Thank you, ma'am. Don't mention it, just doing me job. Oh, that one! Hot and cold running charm. I know. I mean, I know people like that. Make yourself cozy, dearie. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Hello? Oh! Ellie May! Taylor, I'm so very, very, very sorry to be late, but you should have waited. Don't you know I'd never, ever, ever disappoint you? You come back here, right now. Well, sure enough, sugar. That's a good boy. I try to be. I'll see ya. Thank you. -What happened? -It worked! Did you get the checks? We got the arrest warrants, we've got everything the DA needs. Hopefully he won't get arrested till we get what we need tomorrow night! To tomorrow night. Tomorrow night. -Hello there. -Evenin', ma'am. Oh Taylor Whitmaw, you are one of a kind! Why, you're looking lovely tonight. Why thank you, Taylor. Come on in, now. Nice spread. Well, thank you, Taylor. Now why don't you sit down and make yourself comfy? Oh, thank you very much. I'll go get you a drink. Bloody Mary? But down where I come from we call it the devil's drink. But I think it was named for you, Taylor Whitmaw. Hot, spicy, and a lot naughty. Here you go. Thank you. Whoa. Good, huh? Yes. I thought you'd like it. Now you drink up, now. You bet! I've got some yummy hors d'oeuvres in that oven. (CHOKING) Mmm-hmm. 'Scuse me. Whew. How's it going? I left him speechless. I think that's because I burned the tongue out of his mouth. Good! Come on, act two. Now Taylor, what are you doing way over there? Now you come on over here, now. Oh, Taylor! Have some hors d'oeuvres! Ahem! Excuse me, Taylor, I have this silly little tickle in my throat. That's our cue. Detective Currigan, please. And now for the main course. Follow me, now, Taylor. Right this way. Well, we seem to have found him. If you'd just come to... ...and turn on De Sota, and come to 1034. Thank you. Do you mind? Not at all. Taylor, you seem so overdressed. -Why don't you take off your tie? -Oh, yeah. And... Ohhh. Oh, but Taylor... 'Scuse me, Taylor, I have to go powder something. What? Huh? Think of me when I'm gone. Oh, I will. Why, Doctor. Doctor, you're taking your fee before you examine the patient. Are you going to read me a poem before bed, Michael? I hear San Quentin's terrific this time of year, Kev. You're all crazy. No, Doctor, we've just regained our sanity. Get out of my way! Why Taylor, you frisky thing, you couldn't wait for me? -Look at him go! -Bye-bye, Taylor! Toodles! Mr. Hogan, you're under arrest. You have a right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right... How could the judge set such low bail for Larry Hogan? Let's just say he was not that sympathetic to our case. Have a seat. His justification was that Hogan posed no significant threat to society. -Oh, that's unbelievable. -That's the downside of the legal system. Look, it's not over yet. We won't have the same judge for trial. Our job now is to make the best showing we can our next day in court. I want us to walk in there like a force to be reckoned with. Hello. You must be Miss Robbins. I see you made it in no time at all. Yes, thank you. Now. If you'll just sign here, please. We've had every guest sign this register for the last 34 years. Yes I know, I was here once before. Hm. Odd. I pride myself in remembering all the guests. Especially the pretty ones. Well, I wasn't here alone. Yes, it's, uh, it's coming back to me now. Was... Did he ever come here with anyone else? Oh please, I need to know. The register tells it all. Well, there is. There's a logical explanation for each piece of evidence. Well, it's nothing but old girlfriends who wanted more of me than I was willing to give them. And now they're disappointed, they're spiteful... Well, I appreciate your understanding, Miss Stewart. By the way, what do I call a lady lawyer? Well, all right. Thank you, Marilyn. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) May I call you back? Thank you. What are you doing here? How'd you get in? I knocked. The door wasn't latched. Well, what do you want? I know about everything. All the women. And now I can help you change. I love you more than anything in the world, and I don't care what you've done. I want to help you. How? I'll testify for you. I'll stand by your side at the trial. I don't believe you. Maybe you'll believe this. Now, come on. -Say, let's get out of here right now. Come on. -No! We don't have to. I don't want us to be running for the rest of our lives. -I cannot risk going to jail. -You won't, you won't! We can't build a life on nothing, though, and if we leave now, you lose the bail money, I lose the business. But if we stay, I can sell the clip joint. I already have a buyer. I have lots of money. We can buy the best defense there is, and we will beat this thing, I promise you. We'll walk out of there... free. With money to burn. You'd do this for me? I would do more. So much more. -Who are all these women? -I don't know, but I hope they're on our side! Look! There's the lady from the dress shop who refused to testify. Which one? WOMAN NEARBY: Boo! He just makes me sick. Uh oh. Look at this. This is your life, Larry Hogan. I thought you ladies could use some help. Cassie, we missed you. Can I change my plea? Your honor, I request permission to approach the bench. Granted. You honor, my client would like to change his plea. Counsel? The defendant wishes to withdraw his plea. Do you have any objections? -No. -Be seated. It has come to my attention that the defendant wishes to withdraw his plea. Will the defendant please rise? How does the defendant now wish to plead? No contest, your honor. Excuse me, I didn't hear that. I said no contest, your honor. I find you guilty on counts 1 through 12. JUDGE: Bailiff? WOMAN NEARBY: You get what you deserve! Bye-bye! ALL: Yeah!
