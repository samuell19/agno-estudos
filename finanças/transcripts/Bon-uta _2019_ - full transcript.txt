TELECOM STAFF INC. BON-UTA: A Song from Home March 11th, 2011 The Great East Japan Earthquake Due to the nuclear disaster, the residents of Futaba are still under evacuation. They've been scattered to regions throughout Japan. Summer 2015 4 years after the earthquake Motomiya, Fukushima 80 km away from Futaba Evacuees of Futaba rehearse a BON-UTA, a song to honor ancestors. Hisakatsu Yokoyama Bon-Dance Drummer and Drum Maker I can't get the sound right. I haven't played in so long. Since the earthquake? Yeah, not at all. My voice is coarse. It's our first rehearsal since we left town. In Fukushima? We used to play together often, but this is our first time since the earthquake. Futaba is dying. So we have to play the Futaba Bon-Uta somewhere to keep it alive. Motomiya, Fukushima Hisakatsu's place of evacuation "Sendan Taiko Futaba, Fukushima" Great collection! I don't play so well, but I love to collect guitars. This is a real Fender Telecaster. I got it after graduating high school. I'm an electrical engineer, and this guitar is the reason I became one. Back in junior high, rock n' roll was popular. Hisakatsu But electric guitars were so expensive that I couldn't buy one. And no amplifier, either. So I made the guitar myself. When I played it, it sounded fine. So I went to a technical high school and became an electrical engineer. Bucchan. Did you adopt him? Yes, he came yesterday. I made all the taiko in here. I made taiko for about 20 years. Totally self-taught, I made them my own way. Do you make taiko here, too? Not since I evacuated. Why not? I always made drums at night, after work. Peeling wood and stretching the drum skin make a lot of noise. I don't want to disturb my neighbors here. How is your home back in Futaba? It's totally ruined. They classified it as a "difficult-to-return zone". When I get permission to return, I wish I could stay forever. For example, when I go to my drum-making room, I end up looking for things I forgot to take with me. Even though I know there's nothing left to take. I do the same in another room. My time there passes in a blink, and it's hard to leave. Heading to Futaba Good morning. Driver's license. Here's mine. Here you go. Everyone's license, please. Everyone's? Why? The rules have changed. What if they don't drive? Any ID is fine. If they don't have one? Then next time. The rules keep changing. All the time. Entry to Futaba is permitted only 5 hours per day. That used to be a butcher shop. It's destroyed. The town looks so different. That was a bicycle shop. Right. That was a barber shop. There's nothing left now. How terrible. Haruo Imaizumi Bon-Dance Drummer Stop the car over there. Twelve microsieverts. Is that high? It's high radiation. A wild boar. And a small one. I wonder if the neighbors have come home. Even temporarily. This is my friend's house. Three of us used to play here as children. Yo-chan. Where is he now? He moved to Yokohama to work as a taxi driver. Welcome to my haunted house. When the nuclear power plant was built, my father started working there. Before that, he was a truck driver. His pay was so low. Our family really struggled. We were one of the poorest families around here. What's this room? It's my playground. We played guitar and pretended we were a band. Let's see how it sounds. Oh, it's all right. It's the first time I've played in a difficult-to-return zone. And the first time since the earthquake. It's exciting. So peaceful. Ai Iwane Photographing Fukushima and Hawaii The shutter is wide open? Is it dry plate photography? No. It's film. Here we go! OK! We're shooting! Lift up your faces. Stay there! It's turning. OK, we're done! Hello, I'm Hisakatsu Yokoyama. I love the Bon Dance passed down to me in my hometown, Futaba. It hasn't been held since the earthquake. Ai told me that there's also a Bon Dance in Hawaii. It's a Bon-Uta of old Fukushima immigrants, performed every summer. To see it with my own eyes, I went to Hawaii with my old friend, Haruo. Ai helped us as a guide to meet the descendants of Fukushima immigrants in Hawaii. Maui, Hawaii Paia Mantokuji Soto Zen Mission During the Bon period every summer in Hawaii, descendants of Japanese immigrants worship their ancestors. Maui Taiko These performers are mainly Japanese Americans. Kay Fukumoto Leader of Maui Taiko In Japan we play only one song repeatedly. For two hours. But in Hawaii they play 20 songs. The Bon Dance has evolved here. It travelled from Japan to Hawaii and became even more beautiful. They have a true Japanese spirit. People of all races wore kimonos very nicely. And their dance was beautiful. I was surprised to see how earnestly the locals danced. I guess we really do love the Bon Dance. Yes, I've loved it since I was a kid. Over 100 years ago, a Bon-Uta was brought into Hawaii by immigrants from Fukushima. Fukushima Ondo A lot of dancers gathered More dancers than ears of rice in autumn This song was passed down to Kay by her father. Albert Sadao Watanabe Kay's father So your grandfather brought the song? Yes, from Fukushima. Did you also perform when you were young? Yes, and I played the drums. It was fun and exciting. Is your dad or grandfather in this picture? My dad. I see. Tomio Watanabe His name's Tomio. Amazing. Fukushima City, Fukushima I'm Isao. Isao & Keiko Watanabe We're the family of Kay, the Maui Taiko leader. "Dedication of merit for ancestors" This year's harvest is great There's plenty of ears of rice This Bon-Uta was brought into Maui. Immigrants from Fukushima played their Bon-Uta, Fukushima Ondo, and it became popular across Hawaii. Fukushima Ondo of Oahu Soto Mission of Aiea, Taiheiji This year's harvest is great There's plenty of ears of rice Fukushima Ondo of Hawaii Island Puna Hongwanji Mission This year's harvest is great There's plenty of ears of rice Summer 2016 5 years after the earthquake Difficult-to-return zone. There's a gate when you get off the highway. Thank you. Do you have everything? Let's go. It's hot. The tombstones fell during the earthquake. Tokyo Electric Power cleaned up the graveyard and put the stones back up. Chizuko Imaizumi Taiko Drummer This view used to be nicer before the quake. We used to play like ninjas. We threw can lids against that pillar. Who was a better ninja? Me. Don't remember. I was better. We often saw ostriches here. When you were young? No, after the earthquake. There was an ostrich zoo nearby. A lot of ostriches ran away from there after the earthquake. They liked hanging out along the rail tracks here. There may be snakes. I hate them. What? Don't scare me. Just look at us. We're still kids. Joint Bon Dance Festival event space The Bon Dance was here? Yes, we set up a tower in the middle and hung lights around it. People from different Futaba districts danced as they gathered here. Then we all danced in a circle during Bon. It was also our only chance all year to see certain familiar faces. As a kid I watched my father play the taiko. I thought he was cool. We built two towers here. Joint Bon Dance Festival People from each district climbed the tower and performed their Bon-Uta every summer. Everyone was excited to compete while performing on towers here. I started this electrical work company here when I was 26. Our area had a lot of public works. When the nuclear accident occurred, we were very busy. I was at a wood chip factory in a nearby town at the time of the accident. So I didn't know if my son in Futaba was safe. I asked the security officials if I could look for him in Futaba, but they didn't let me in. I tried asking the Self-Defense Force to search for him. But they wouldn't look for just one person. With such huge accidents, the life of one person doesn't amount to much. I was reminded of the importance of protecting my family. And how much I love them. Love makes you stronger. Motomiya, Fukushima Haruo's place of evacuation You and Hisakatsu still live near each other in this city. And in your hometown you were neighbors, too? Yes. Why? There's a strong bond between us. We always played together as little kids. At the time of the earthquake, where were you? I was working at the nuclear power plant. As a guard? Yes, a security guard. The nuclear accident occurred after you evacuated to the quake proof building? Yes, there was an explosion. Rubble started to fall afterward. I thought I could never go home again. After he returned safely, even our friends blamed us. Just because he was working at the nuclear power plant. There were in fact times like that, but no one knew who to blame for taking their homes. What happened, happened. We just have to accept it. Ai asked us to go to Hawaii, so we went to the Bon Dance there last year with her. She told us the people in Hawaii want to learn the Futaba Bon-Uta. It made us want to go teach it to them. 50 years from now, if your descendants decide to return to Futaba, do you think they can learn their Bon-Uta from the people in Maui? I haven't thought that far ahead. What about you? I have. That's why we're going to Hawaii. Seven people from Futaba visit Hawaii to teach Futaba's Bon-Uta. It says "Bon Dance". Is it just like ours? It's exciting. Everyone is excited and losing themselves in the dance. Yoko Idogawa Dancer What a large number of dancers! There are as many of them as at our dance in Futaba. Mihoko Yamane Flute player They're saying they definitely want to learn our dance. The song? The song, dance, and drums. I want you to teach them. Mieko Ito/Singer ã€€Kichio Ito/Chorus There are 10 points to discuss. Number one, how much money should we bring per person? For eating, souvenirs, and whatever. The best way is to bring your credit card. Number two, what kind of souvenirs should I get in Hawaii? And... Are there mosquitos? No. Anti-itch cream? Maui, Hawaii We meet again. Look, we can see the Bon Dance site from here. There's a graveyard. She's a second-generation immigrant from Fukushima. This is Setsuko Takahashi, second generation, and... I'm 90 years old. 90 years old. And Setsuko's mother came from... She came from Fukushima. Where was your mother raised in Fukushima? In Date county. I don't know where it is. I see. This way. Mom. It's been a while. I have good news for you, Mom. Here are the guests from Fukushima. Thank you. I'm sure she is happy. Maui Taiko's practice room We are from Futaba, Fukushima. Our town experienced a large earthquake, tsunami, and a nuclear power plant accident. Because of the disasters, we can't live in our hometown. We probably can't return during our lifetime. We hope you learn the Futaba Bon Dance and pass it on to your children and grandchildren. Someday when our descendants can return to Futaba, please teach it to them. This is our sincere wish. Go like this. Next to the center. Step again to the right. And a full moon. Down, and clap your hands. Repeat these. Left, center, right, circle, down, and clap your hands. Should we sing? We'll begin with the first verse. Start with a high voice. Then there is a chorus. How do you feel? It's especially hard to teach the song. Even harder than the other parts of the Bon Dance. We've been singing this for decades. You can't learn it in 2 hours. Once or twice isn't enough. You need to practice over and over. If I'd explained better in English, maybe the meaning of the Bon-Uta would have made more sense. Ai, you can't explain this song in words, no matter how eloquent. Traditional culture and arts are passed on over years. At some point the performer becomes the dance. You're doing the same thing for 2 hours. So you go into a trance. But this can't be learned. I wasn't born in Futaba, but 40 years have passed since I started to live there. It was just a few years ago that I felt I became one of Futaba's people. And I finally got used to Futaba's Bon-Uta. Day of the Bon Dance Festival Let's begin. Let's go step by step. Here we go. Sing "Aaah". Go. Play like this. Again. It's here. Let's try verse 3 next. It's 3 pm, but are we continuing? Yes. We won't finish at this pace. But if we don't learn it, we won't get anywhere. Where are your ancestors from? Fukushima. My mother is from Fukushima. I'm third generation. This is my mother. That is my uncle. From Kumamoto. My father is from Japan. Your mother? She is from Hawaii. I'm second generation, but I don't speak Japanese. You're doing just fine. After the earthquake, this Fukushima sign drifted across the ocean for 4 years, and now it's in Maui. Wow. He found this on the beach here. Oh my goodness. Maybe it came from the shore of Futaba. Thank you for finding this. Amazing. You can still read the sign. It was meant to come here. Maui and Fukushima are connected. Futaba Bon-Uta This year's harvest is great There's plenty of ears of rice In the grass on the road The rice is growing Live until you're 100 I'll live until I'm 99 Let's be together until we grow grey hair Great. You were great. We were in sync. This right here is the best way to learn. December 16th, 2016 Maui The last sugar cane plantation in Hawaii, where Japanese immigrants once worked so hard, was closed. Kay Fukumoto Founder of Maui Taiko In 1885, an immigration treaty was signed and immigration from Japan to Hawaii began. Most immigrants were from poor Japanese agricultural towns. Most immigrants intended to earn money to send back home, but the pay was very low despite the hard labor, and they couldn't go home. They made a song of nostalgia for their homes far away. Hawaii, Hawaii, I came chasing a dream Now my tears flow in the cane field I can work better today Because I received a letter from my family in Japan Shall I go on to America or should I return to Japan This is my dilemma here in Hawaii If I don't earn enough money when the treaty is over I will become fertilizer for the Taro field in Hawaii When I left Yokohama I cried as we sailed away But now I'm not lonely, because I have children and grandchildren 1941 Attack on Pearl Harbor The U.S. and Japan went to war. Similarly to the mainland, some Japanese Americans in Hawaii Some second generation Japanese Nisei Americans enlisted in the army to regain their honor as Americans. George Ariyoshi/ Governor of Hawaii (1974-1986) Grace Amemiya Sakai/ Hawaii Shochiku Orchestra We the Nisei Americans made and sang Japanese songs, which was forbidden during the war. I'm going to sing a major hit Japanese song that was born in Hawaii. Wakare-no-Iso-Chidori Meeting you was the beginning of good-bye I know that very well But I still feel bittersweet The seabirds know how I feel Soto Mission of Hawaii, Shoboji Where were you born? In Hawaii. Faye Komagata Originator of creative taiko drumming in Hawaii In Oahu. Are you third generation? How did you start taiko drumming? I learned authentic taiko drumming in Kona. I continued drumming because it was fun. Then I went to Japan to learn more. And I continued to play at the Bon Dance in Hawaii. Sometimes I was the only drummer, back in the old days. At the Bon Dance. I heard you are ill. She has pancreatic cancer. The toughest type of cancer. It's really bad. Treatment isn't going well. People around me give me energy. That's how I keep my chin up every day. Faye sings her favorite Japanese song. As I wander along the shore I recall the old days The sound of the wind The shape of the clouds The waves that hit And the color of shells "Futaba town gathering" There she is! Long time no see! I have some news for you. You may have heard already. I'm getting married next month. Congratulations! My husband is taking my family name. I have some more news. I'm also 4 months pregnant. Wow. Shiro Izawa Mayor of Futaba This is the 6th Bon period since the nuclear accident. Our residents are still scattered in 38 cities all across Japan. "Kobayashi and Yamane Family's Wedding" "Ms. Mihoko Yamane" Tatsuhiro Kobayashi I can't believe I'm getting married. After the earthquake, I started working in reconstruction support. Then I moved to Futaba. And here I am now. So you're not from Futaba? No, I'm from Tokyo. I have strong feelings for Futaba. My parents built a home there after they met. Mihoko Yamane Flute player They raised me and my two siblings. And lived their life in Futaba. It's my mission to keep Futaba alive. I don't want it to vanish. I want to do what I can for Futaba. So here I am now. Do you want to go back and live there? Well, I'm having a baby. I have to think about my family first. But someday when we grow old, I want to return. Evacuation city of Mr. and Mrs. Ito Koriyama, Fukushima How is song practice going here? Mieko Ito Singer It was much easier in Futaba. I could sing as loud as I wanted to. You can't raise your voice here. I really want to sing! But I'm worried about my neighbors. I tried singing in the car once, but I was still worried that people nearby could hear. Do you want to live in Futaba again? Yes. I want to go home. Our house is still there. Ito's house in Futaba Kichio Ito Nuclear power plant builder I came to Fukushima in 1967 to build the nuclear power plant. This house was built in 1971. My company helped build the nuclear reactor and turbines. I was a contractor for the concrete. I hired as many as 350 people to work on site. Some of them helped to build this house. With special concrete, the same as the power plant. This is where you sang. I wouldn't disturb anyone here if I sang loud. I'm choking. Too many emotions. I can't sing. How I miss this place... I can't sing. There's too much on my mind. Normally this field would be golden. Now it's brown because of the weeds. I've never seen such weeds. They're probably exotic. Namie, Fukushima Neighboring town to Futaba Yoko Idogawa Dancer, married to a farmer in Futaba This rice field belongs to my birth family. We were farmers for generations. We planted rice by hand and barefoot when I was a child. Was it hard? Yes, very hard. I didn't want to marry a farmer. Then what happened? I married a farmer! Are there any fields in your evacuation city? No. It's so sad. They don't even have any weeds. Do you miss picking weeds? If I see any weeds, I'll let them grow and enjoy pulling them out. I know I can't go back home. And everyone has to come back for the town to revive. I can relate to how Japanese immigrants in Hawaii must have felt. They must have had a hard time. Evacuating has made me understand. I never would have known otherwise. I heard your ancestors migrated to Fukushima. Yes. My ancestors also had a hard time. I heard they moved from Toyama. The temple's destroyed. Hello. It's been a while. Hiroshi Sasaki Yoko's cousin, Currently an evacuee You look well. It's been a while. I'm still alive. You have to stay alive! The house where they grew up It's a mess. This door is open. Let's enter here. The floor is about to give way. These are old papers. Who kept them? Me. It's the oldest record of our family. From the 1860s. Our ancestors kept them. I'm so grateful. Here are the records of migration. From when our ancestors moved out here. This says they came from Toyama. Etchu Tonami Kitanomura, Sanjiro Sanjiro Father was 46 years old. That says "Noe". Noe is the name of their ancestor. I wanted to visit Toyama, but I can't because of my condition. Please go visit Toyama for me. Nanto, Toyama 500 km from Futaba Temple found in the family papers Hello. Welcome. On October 18th, a daughter of Sanjiro of Arifusa village was given wealth from the family and went back with three children to Sanjiro's house, for which the name is now Sanjuemon. My ancestors definitely came from Toyama. They followed our temple. The original Bon-Uta was said to be made in this area. Chongare Mokuren Sonja A song about Buddha's disciple Mokuren. He saved his mother, who went to hell. Mokuren called for his mother loudly And his miserable mother in hell heard the small voice of her son Mokuren from the present life Over 200 years ago, there was a big famine in Fukushima. Many residents died and only a third of the population remained. So they recruited people in this area to move to Fukushima. My ancestors apparently faced incredible hardships. They were discriminated against by the people already living in Fukushima. The people who planted rice weren't given any water. They weren't permitted to marry the local women, either. That's how it was when I was young at least. I came here today to see where my ancestors lived. When I think of the hardships they faced, it gives me strength to fight against radiation. I hope we can continue our relationship. This is a story from the years 1707 and 1788 Mount Fuji and Mount Asama erupted The sky was filled with smoke The sun disappeared It was a cold summer The chilly wind killed the crops A severe famine came Flowers couldn't grow And rice couldn't grow There was no food Everyone died No babies were born The population of Soma Went down from 90,000 to 30,000 The fields were barren The willow tree wept "Toyama" Is this Fukushima? Who are you? I've never seen you. My name is Sanjiro, from Toyama. I'm hungry, Dad. Noe, be quiet. What do you want? I heard there is a field we can plow. No farms for outsiders. Go home. Wait. The feudal lord let these immigrants in. I see. Fine then. Thank you very much. I heard that you get money from the lord. I also heard you burn people who die. Horrible. No one can marry such people. Get out, outsiders. Go home. Dad, let's go to the Bon Dance. No, they won't let us dance. Why not? Because we're outsiders. I want to go home. This is our home. Thank the land and work hard. Farming can't be done alone. Help everyone with planting, plowing, and reaping. Always remember that, Noe. I see. Time has passed Noe is now a woman She has a husband She had 8 children And 18 grandchildren 8 is a good luck number Civilization blossomed Noe is happy She is 88 now Let me help you. Thank you. Think nothing of it. You've helped us a lot. We'll always help each other. Noe, don't you miss your hometown? I dream about it. But for my kids, this is their hometown. That's right. Yes. Tonight is the full moon. Come to the Bon Dance Festival. I can come? The village is back to normal thanks to your family. We'll dance together! My father would be happy. I'm so grateful. Namo Amida Butsu Namo Amida Butsu... It's not time to go to heaven yet. Are you Noe's grandchild? Come in. Hurry up. You can play the drums. Thank you. Noe will be happy. Girls always like taiko drummers. The drumbeats can be heard all through town. Chase the ogres out, and wish for a rich harvest. Let's switch, Shiro. You're doing great. This year's harvest is great There's plenty of ears of rice This is the happiest moment. Good sound. It's delicious. Can't the residents return to Futaba for just one day, and do the Bon Dance Festival in summer? That's not possible in my opinion. It's literally a "difficult-to-return zone". You can't have a festival there. There's no way everyone would return at once just for a Bon Dance. Why do you walk at night? To get some exercise. January 1st, 2017 6 years after the earthquake How long has it been since you made a taiko? Well... 6 or 7 years. Is this the first time since the earthquake? Yes. Are the tools handmade, too? Yes. I made them. You need a rope for this part. I wondered what that's for. Not for hanging. I am afraid it's loud. Is that why you can't make drums like before? Yes. So you don't disturb your neighbors? If I get complaints, I'll feel uncomfortable living here. I have concern for my family. Still more, we're outsiders and evacuees. They're nice to us, but we're still outsiders. This might be the last taiko I make. Hisakatsu wrote a song about a cherry tree in Futaba Don-do-ko-don. No, it's don-ko-ko-don. Don-ko-ko-don. Yes. Ko-ko-don-kon. One, two, three, four... After 4 verses, ton-ton. This song is about a ogre. It's crawling on the ground. And there's a cherry tree nearby. The tree is trying its best to bloom, fighting against the ogre. That's what the song's about. Fighting against the ogre. The ogre is radiation. It's crawling. I don't want to say this. The tree believes that even if there's radiation remaining people will come back in the spring. The radiation is the ogre in this song. Sakura (Cherry Blossoms) What's up? Something wrong? I want to discuss something. What is it? What is it? I want to hold a Joint Bon Dance gathering all the district teams in Futaba. Sure! We've been dreaming about it. The Bon-Uta from each district is different. That's the point. Once everyone hears this plan, they're going to be so excited. Let's get ready and call them tomorrow. I'm early. I have a favor to ask. What is it? Should we talk here? No, come on in. We have a plan to hold a Joint Bon Festival. Yoshihiko Nomura Kamihatori district Of Futaba? Yes. Will you play the flute for your district? Sure. I just need some practice. Great! It's a dream of mine to hear the melody of the best flute player in Futaba. Well, thank you! Congratulations! Thank you. It's a girl. Her name is Sayori. Hi Sayori. How old is she? She's 4 months old. She laughs a lot and sleeps well. It makes things easier. I want to teach her the flute and drums. Do you remember this song? I heard you got a flute. Stop teasing me. Can we listen? Let's see. The sound's not right. - How's that? - Amazing! I'll do the small drums. Kamihatori district Near Yoshihiko's house in Futaba This building measures the radiation level. The recorded level was 1,590 microsieverts per hour when the iodine was scattered right after the accident. It wasn't publicized immediately and made the headlines about a year later. 1,590 is a very high number. It's extremely high. The amount of iodine decreases to half in 8 days. There were still about 8 houses that didn't evacuate. They didn't have enough gasoline. I think they were exposed to a lot of radiation. Thieves broke in again! Did they? There's nothing inside. People obviously did this, not animals. How old is your family? I'm 31st generation. We were the oldest family in the area. We've always been farmers. I've evacuated to an agricultural area, so I miss farming. But I can't come back here to farm. Do you see this? There's no way. No restoration? Futaba town officials say they'll decontaminate. The Fukushima government will apparently support the project. This is a designated decontamination zone. But who's going to maintain the land after that? I can't. What do you think of Hisakatsu's drumming? His drumming is very unique. Only he can do it. He doesn't just play on rhythm, but he knows what sounds beautiful. That gives joy to the listener. No one can play like he does. He's very talented. Despite the fact that he can't read musical scores. What's up? I see. It has been decided to hold the Futaba Joint Bon Dance Festival at temporary housing for evacuees in Iwaki, Fukushima. It's Haruo. I'll be there in one hour. Takao Tatebayashi Hosoya district Are you serious? Yes. Even if you are alone in your district, I want you to take part with some support. It's fun to take part in the Bon Dance. Even the preparation is so exciting. We have a plan to hold a Joint Bon Dance Festival. 8 teams from different districts can take part in it, so the scale will be more than half of what we used to do. Everyone loves the Bon Dance, so they are willing to help out. They asked me to cooperate Yoshihisa Nakaya Organizer of the festival and provide a festival site, because they're also Bon Dance lovers. Kazuharu Fukuda Shimo-Nagatsuka district When summer comes, my body responds. Once I feel the humidity from the sea, I start thinking it's time! 8 of 12 districts in Futaba will participate, which is great. Some districts are eager to participate even if it's only one person. They really want to preserve their own district's Bon-Uta. They will be more motivated as the festival day approaches. I have a pain in the knee due to old age. I'm practicing. Heading to Futaba to pick up the festival tower, the symbol of the Bon Dance Good morning. Is this OK? Should we start by carrying these? I'm the leader of Team Nagatsuka. What is your part in the Bon Dance? I sing. You lead the music. Yes. I'm from Nagatsuka. I'm from Shimo-Nagatsuka. I'm from Kannon-do. I'm from around the corner! It's my birthday today! Please sing. Thank you! Thank you! I'm 37 now! Congratulations! I definitely want to return to Futaba someday. The day before the festival Preparing for the festival is a lot of work, huh? Yes. There's so much pressure that my stomach hurts. August 12th, 2017 Futaba Joint Bon Dance Festival Temporary housing for evacuees in Iwaki, Fukushima Which way? Is it locked in place? Is this really OK? Wait a sec. It's a little stuck. The sound is coarse. Hello! One, two, three... I'm here. Hello again. Hello. Thanks for coming. Everyone gather for a picture. The camera will turn once I start shooting. When the lens faces you, please hold still and smile. Ready? Turning now. Show me your best face. Smile, organizers! The lens is coming.

Please dance with us. This year's harvest is great There's plenty of ears of rice In the grass on the road The rice is growing
