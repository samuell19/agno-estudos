Then let him find another one.Sure. Hold on, I'm getting another call.I'll call you back. Bye. Hello. Hi, honey.Yes, I'm in the courthouse. Yes, I'll be there before 7:00pm. I'm entering the elevator.I'll call you back. Bye. Out of order Criminal Court of First instanceN* 31 Hi, pretty. Please, Counselor, just a minute! Excuse me, Counselor. Please, stay, we're done here. Fine. You don't need the handcuffs. Don't expose the guard, Counselor. Hi. Sorry, I didn't know you were busy. Can you believe the public defenderdidn't show up? I wouldn't miss a meetingwith you. It's the second time he declareson his own. I called the defender, he said he interviewed himand there's no much to do. - He's a son of a bitch.- There are a lots of them. I brought you a copyof the Spanish judge's request for the extraditionof Perez-Ramallo. - I'll make sure the judge sees it.- Great. Tell me something. What can we do for the judgeto see it this week? You flatter me, but it doesn't workthat way in my court. Don't get me wrong, but the judgemust see it this week. Periods will expire, and the defense will use thatto close the case. - Sit down.- But it's important. What's wrong? Since the defense didn't show,the Prosecutor is about to get the case to be consideredaggravated murder and this guy will geta life sentence. Unless he finds a good lawyerto take his case. I don't do these cases, I know nothingabout blood crimes. Do you know what the defendersaid to me? To not worry,that he wouldn't appeal. That everything was fine. - Can you believe it?- Then he has a defender, even if he's bad, it's not ethicalfor me to review the case. Nor is it ethical for meto rush a case over another one. Let me see. He's from Santiago del Estero. He is alone.He worked at a butcher shop, he is lost and needs help. Don't answer me now,think about it. - Take it with you.- You're giving me the original. Give it back to me later. I'll make sure the judge sees this. The Boss, anatomy of a crime. Butcher shop Come on. - How are you?- Good day.

I'll let it go this time. When in doubt,there's the poster with the cuts. These old cuts, put them here, Hermogenes. It's for ground beef, okay? And keep the refrigerator neat. It's essential. When you're in a rush,it's easy to mix up the meat, and they must always be separated. Beef in one place, chickenin another and pork in another. Okay? Don't mix them, and give them spacefor the cold to flow. And be careful not to coverthe cooling fans. Hello. Hi, what shall I get you? Rump steak. How much? About a kilo. Is it good?

You're doing well, son of a bitch. If you're doing well,why the hell don't you pay me? - Tell me!- I'll pay you. You think I'm stupid?When are you going to pay? - Give me a chance.- I gave you 15 chances! - Tomorrow...- Tomorrow mi ass! Are you going to kill me? Guess who is goingto kill whom? Son of a bitch! Damn you! Come here.Don't play macho with me. You filthy Paraguayan. If I see you here again,I swear I'll kill you. This drunk son of a bitchdidn't know how to work. He stole from me,all Paraguayans are thieves. Do you get it? And I know you're honest. You work well. You're Argentine,and you don't drink. That's why I want you in chargeof this shop. Me, sir? Don't worry about him. He won't set foot around here again. I want to give you a chance,if you're willing. Yes, I'm willing, boss. The problem is I don't knowhow to get here. Where do you live? I'm renting a roomin Claypole. That's so far. How much are you paying there? Around $300 pesos a week, boss. For that kind of moneyyou can stay here. I have a room in the back. Come, let's see it. I think if you clean it up, you can make it livable. You'll freeze here,but it's over here. See? Damn it. You would have your own place. I'll take it out of your paycheck,don't worry about that. I'm with my wife, sir. What does she do? She's a cleaning lady.She doesn't have a job right now. Let's leave things the way they are. She can rent the room with meand help me out in the shop. Panties mean mess,and I can't pay another salary. She wouldn't work here,she'd only help me out. Okay.Let's give it a try. You're out on the streetif there's a problem. Yes, sir.Thanks a lot. You have to pay the electric bill. I'll charge you one kilo of meata day, even if you don't eat it. - Do you have your ID?- Yes, boss. Give it to me. I'm used to doing difficult jobs,I've always worked a lot. I'm unsuited,but I won't fail you, boss. If you work hard,you'll advance with me. Look at the stupid faceyou had here. Clara, please, can you take careof Joaquina for a minute? Clara! You could take care of her, also. I'm working, my love. What's that? - Did you take on a new case?- I didn't take on a new case. They gave it to me in exchangefor rushing the extradition. You always have an excuse. And I'm giving up patients, - and you take on a new case.- I didn't take on a new case. Wait, love.Let's not fight. When the extraditioncomes through we will move, hire a nannyto help with Joaquina. I can solve this with 2 calls and3 meetings, I'm exchanging favors. - Perfect.- Good. But I'm going backto the office next week. - Monday and Thursday.- Sure. I remember. - Then you'll take care of her.- I will. Here it is. And you're the only manager? That's what Mr. Latuada said. With your help. If you behave. I'll behave very well. - Okay.- You'll see. - Are you cold?- A little. Zip your jacket up. We're almost in. There you go. It's dark. Are you scared? I'm going to find the light switch,he didn't tell me where it is. I found it. So? It's pretty. Have you seen how big it is? - It's nice, right?- Yes! Come in, I'll show you the room. Come on... Look how dirty it is. - He was dirty, we need to clean.- I'll take care of it. - Yeah?- Here? In the back. Look. Oh, you're walking fast. There you go. We have arrived. Your hands are cold.

See you later.Have a nice day, Madam. Good, Santiago. I'm counting on youto make this butcher shop progress. Yes, boss. I think there are rats. My wife and I found droppingsunder the wood. That Paraguayan was filthy. - Has he come by?- I haven't seen him. Good. Buy poison and jot it downin the notebook. I'll also bring paint,so you can paint the ceiling. I know how to do those things. You can do it on Sunday. Would your wife want to workat my house? Yes, sir. - Whatever you say.- Then it's done. Here, take this. I subtracted what you owe. Thanks a lot, boss. Hermogenes, come here! What are all these pieces? - This meat is kind of rotten, boss.- What? I was going to grind itand mix it with fresh meat, but I think it's too rotten. So you want to teach memy business? You idiot! Do you know what this is?It's money! Money! Will you pay for it? - Sorry, I didn't know.- You sell it all. All the meat. How many timesdo I have to tell you? I bought all the meat,understand? Whatever you don't sell,you pay for. - Is that clear?- Yes, sir. - Do you want me to do it now?- No, no. Go. Do you understand me, Santiago? - Yes, boss.- Okay. I'm counting on you. - Yes.- Don't fail me. Come on, let's go. Do you want to work or not? Let's go! Get in. Come this way, please. Hello? I called you to see if you can help meto find somebody. Is she reliable? Ask her if she canon Mondays and Thursdays. Yes. Well, then a cousinor a sister. No phones beyond this point. Okay, somebodyto help us out. Find it out, I can't talk anymore. Okay, I have to hang up.Find it out. Bye. - Come with me.- Forgive me. Wait here,we'll be right with you. Okay, thank you. Hello. Mr. Saldivar, right? - Yes, sir.- Good. You're being indictedfor aggravated murder. So the prosecutor will ask life sentence. But taking into accountyou have no criminal records, that you haven't resistedand you've been collaborating, I think we can negotiatewith the judge and the D.A., and get it changed from aggravatedmurder to homicide. The sentence is 8 to 25 years. Also, I'm going to requesta psychological assessment to see if we can pleaheat of passion. In this case, the sentenceis 3to 6 years. But let's imagine theworst case scenario. I think in a negotiation,we'll be offered 16years. Between us, I think I can get 12. But, let's say 16, okay? After 7 or8 years,you can enjoy temporary release provided you have good conduct. That would bethe worst case scenario. But in a situation like this one, the judge and the prosecutordon't want to complicate their lives extending unproductive processes. So if we propose a speedy trialit will favor the negotiations. Okay? That's the way it is, right? Life is a destiny to fulfill. I killed,and that's is unforgivable. Calm down. I'm here to help you. Take this. Calm down. Calm down. Take this. I... ...I'm lost. I lost my family. Do you know I have a baby girl? Sign here, below your name. Do you know what you just signed? It's my designationas your defense attorney. So? Are you almost done? Yes. Almost. There it is. Did you separate itas I told you? Yes. This is the good oneand this is the other one. Very good, boy. We'll begin with the good one.Pay attention. Sulphite. A little sulphite. And... ...water. Got it? And now, stick you hands in and knead it.Mix it up really well. Go. That's right. It's going to start turningthat nice pink color meat has. Yes, it's very pink.It's true, pink. Exactly. We're going to make sausageswith this one. You just need to focus onquantities, proportions. This is pure math,eight broads, 16 tits. First... - It's an aperitif.- Exactly. And then you give it flavorwith the seasoning. Seasoning for sausages. Yes, very good. And you give it colorwith paprika. Exactly, and... ...then you mix it up, also. Go prepare the machine. What a sight. There. There you go. Start filling the machine.Good. Do you know whatthe most important thing is? The butcher's craftiness. You have to win overthe customers. It's the only way a butcher shopcan work. The way you saw me doing it. You saw that there are cutswe sell more and others less? Yes, nobody buys the rump roastor the flank steak, What you have to do first,is learn the customers names. I know some. Mrs. Nelida comes twice a week. No, no, no, that's not enough.You have to know all their names. Look at me, I know morethan 300 names. And not just that.Also their kid's names, the problems they havewith their husbands. Everything. And if you forget a name,you say, "What can I get you honey,dear, princess,?" whatever. Flatter them a little. You have to be charming,that's the way it works. The success of a butcher shopisn't in the meat, it's in the butcher's charm. That's why the broads come back. And after you flattered her,you finish it off saying, "Oh, my love, look what I havefor you today?" "This round roasthas your name. " Round roast orany cut you're selling. - Did you understand what I said?- Yes, of course I did. You're a fast learner. Look. When one of these expensive cutsis old and smells you must defend it. You have to put some vinegar on itand rinse it with water. That way the odor goes away. And with this old beef round,you can make breaded cutlet. You season it a lot,and add mustard to the eggs, which tastes great. And then you double or triplebread them so they weigh more. Is it clear? The butcher shopis a confessional for women, you win them over talking. The butcher is a ladies' man,that's the secret to this business. I had to stay. He had guests over. Hi. Look what I brought. Did you ask for permission?I don't want any trouble. They were throwing it away. Look what the lady gave me. Nice, right? It looks nice on you. I'll pour you some. The lady arguedwith Latuada last night. Really? She told him to shut up. And he did. - She shut him up?- She told him to shut up. - Really?- Yeah. What's Mr. Latuada's son like? He's chubby. Chubby? Beefy. Well, I'm done. Wait, I have some more. - Good morning, Mrs. NÃ©lida.- The lady wants me to go early. Go ahead, I'll finish. What do you want?You look nice today. Thank you.I'll take breaded cutlets. How much? Two kilos, but I'll take thesethat are already prepared. Are they fresh? Yes, they were just prepared. Okay.Give me 2 kilos. - Very well.- They very fresh, right? Yes, my wife just made them. - Bye, sweetheart.- Bye. - Where are we going?- To see something nearby. But we're very late,I'll be so embarrassed. Embarrassed? I want to go to the butcher shopwhere the crime was committed. - That homicide?- Yes, the homicide. You told me that casewas over, that you'd solve it easily. But It's not that simple,the guy is illiterate. - You what he declared?- What? - That he wants the death sentence.- It doesn't exist here. - I know.- And maybe he deserves it. He doesn't deserve it. - Okay, fine.- Then why do you say that? - You don't know anything about it.- Okay, stop. If he's asking for thathe must feel very guilty. You're right, he feels very guilty. It's eating him up inside. He won't help with his defense. I must do something or the systemwill eat him up. Straight life imprisonment. - Did he get a psychological assessment?- Yes. I already asked for it. Put some on my feet. I'm cold. - Is that better?- Oh, yes. That's enough. Did I tell you? The lady has so many clothes,she has a room for them. Really? A room? Really! Just for clothes,shoes, sneakers. I don't know why she wantsso many clothes. When will she wear it? Right? Life isn't long enough. It's so cold! Pass me the flip-flops. There they are. What are you doing? - Get off.- Are you warmer now? It's a towel. I'll take it off. I'll take that towel off of you now. Are you getting warmer? You like to cuddle. - Good day.- Go unload, I'll open. Is something wrong? How are you doing?Put this on. What about this? Don't look at me. Come on. Look, pay attention.I'll teach to wash meat. The secret ingredient:Sodium hypochlorite. We pour it. Bleach. There you go. Okay. Now, you grab the brush, you wet it a little, and let's go here. Don't worry about the yellow fat. The most important thing hereis the odor next to the bones. So you give it a good brush.Got it? A good brush. There you go. Then you'll cut it the same way.The same cuts as always. You grab the old cut, and you dip it in. And you let it float. Half an hour, one hour. Then you take it out, you hang it up, grab a rag and dry it carefully. Very dry, it can't be humid. Then you cool it. That on one hand,now we'll do the chickens. Magic formula. You grab a chicken, the whole thing,and you cut off the gland. There. You grab it and dip it. Then you take it out, and hang it from a wing. And you let it drain. Is that clear? - Yes.- If you feel it smells like bleach, you get rid of it with white pepper. You cover it in powder. And that's it.Okay, come here now. Stand over there. The fresh meat goeson the right side of the fridge. And on the left, the bad meat,that's how you slowly sell it all. You'll use two dish rags, one with bleach, and you'll only use itfor the scale, and the other oneat the counter with clean water. When you sell a cut, take it outand put it back in quickly. You can't have it out long. And if it smells a lot,use the rag. Which one? The dish rag? Look... Dish rag with bleach, you clean off the scale, you grab the cut, you weigh it,and before putting it back, you use the dish ragwith water, so the broad doesn't noticethe odor of the bleach. This is called workingwith the refrigerator, and it's the keyto the butcher's business. Look, if you're not willing,Latuada will use someone else. - Mr. Hermogenes Saldivar?- Yes, sir. I'm Dr. Ritano. I will ask you some questions,and then show you some drawings. Tell me about yourself. What was you jobin Santiago del Estero? I worked in construction,chopping forests. Hard work. You chopped down trees? Red quebracho, white quebracho,black carob tree, tala, tipu, all kinds of hard woods. How did you cometo Buenos Aires? With my wife, because wageswere low back home. And that's when you began workingas a butcher? No, at first I workedwith the fat. With the fat? I was in a truck that collectsfat from butchers shops. We separate the bones and fatfrom the barrels to sell it. And then? And then I went to the butcher shopbecause of the fat truck. I wanted to leave that job;it was too heavy for me. I had to load and unloadthe barrels, and I couldn't with my bad leg. What's wrong with your leg? When I was a kid I fell off a horse,and he kicked me. It was a fierce horse. There is no alfalfa thereso horses eat corn, they have a tough mouth,it was a spirited horse. You've had a bad leg since then? Yes, of course. That's why I could never... ...have a good job, because I'm unsuited. What do you mean you're unsuited? When I signed up for the army,they rejected me because... How do they call it?That I... ...I have a hernia in my leg. That's whyI've always had hard jobs. Odd jobs and jobs like that. How did your employers knowyou're unsuited? Did you tell them? They know because... ...it's written. Where is it written? In my ID card,there's a stamp that says that. Tell me what you seein these drawings. That's hide, a cowhide. And this one? Two halves. Two halves? Two halves of a cow, yes. Yes. Mate? Um, yes. Okay. It's nice, warm. Go, leave me the thermos. - Go, you'll catch a cold.- I'll stay with you. - Stay with me? Get out, go.- No. - Go back.- No. Are you all right? What's wrong? I don't know. I will get you some water. What are these $3.60? The two rags I bought. Okay. And this? $24, $25, $32.30? $7.20? That's what you told meto separate for the sheriff. Oh, good. Very good. I'll take you to grill someday.Do you know how to? Yes, boss, I used to grill. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon, Madam.- I was here yesterday afternoon. I took a kilo of breaded cutlets,and the meat was bad. Impossible,wesell quality here. My daughterhas been sick since last night. She couldn't go to school. Are you the owner? Hermogenes. Did you sell bad meat? Are you an idiot?You make me look bad? Go get someof the best tenderloin. Go cut some for her. I beg your forgiveness,this has never happened. He's very ignorant,I don't know how to teach him. - No, it's okay, but...- But look at this. Meat freshly cut, it's like butter. The cow was grazing yesterday. It's the least I can do. Forgive me, Madam. If this pain in the ass comes backgive her good meat, so she doesn't complain. And what are you staring at,you piece of shit? Digiovanni. Wait a moment. Nora. - How are you?- How's it going? - You look nice.- You're such a flirt. You never stop. Do you have any newsabout the extradition? That's going well. I brought you this,you won't like it. - What's this?- The psychological assessment. Oh, let's see. Look, read it here. The subject is is awareof the criminality of his act and the crime can't be classifiedas heat of passion, since there was no specific eventthat could trigger... Driven by frustration and hatred,premeditation can be assumed. This guy is crazy. Who did he interview? Are you sure he is a psychologistor a psychiatrist? No, he's the forensic doctor on callI think he's clinical. We have to thank he wasn'tinterviewed by a gynecologist. - What a disaster.- That's the way things are. I'll see what I can do. What's wrong with you? Nothing. I think something is wrong. I don't like the boss. He doesn't treat you well. He's always bitching. He insulted youin front of a client today. He was in a bad mood. He insulted me. It's wasn't personal,he was nervous. He blames you, but he's the onewho brings the bad meat. All butcher shops work that way.That's the way it is. He has 8 butcher shops.He hasn't done too bad. I don't like him. Look what happenedto that girl. What if someone elsegets sick? What do you want me to do? I want to go back to Santiago. For what? We don't even have a house.What will we do there? We have work here,we're doing well. Work? You have work,the boss doesn't pay me. He pays me both our salaries. It's not enough. We never have any money. I want to go back. I don't like it here,I can't even stand the smell. Listen to me. If that's what you want,then we'll go back, but at the end of the month,so we can save some money. Don't worry. - Hello.- What's up? Let me do that. Thanks a lot. Mate? Thank you. You're lucky you got this job. I envy you. I'll see you next week. Talk to Latuadaabout me, okay? My regards to the wifeand kids. Thank you. Let's go. Bye! I'll wait for you at the barin half an hour. Did you hear me? Yes, boss. Hey. Sit down. Do you really want to leave? I find out everything. My wife and I talkedand we're going to Santiago. If it's about that clientfrom the other day, don't take it personally. Forgive me. It's to give her peace of mind. It's part of the job. Don't take it personally. I'm happy with you,you work very well. What are you goingto do in Santiago? Bring him a glass. You have to thinkabout your future. Now that you're goingto have a child, you have to thinkabout your family. Listen to me. I have a proposal for you. I'm in a real estate,in construction. We're making great apartmentsin a very good neighborhood. There's a 3 year waiting list. People are desperatebecause they're big and cheap. I can put you on the listfor a good one. You pay the dues,I take them from your paycheck, so it's easier for you, and when it's ready, you move. Think, now that you're goingto have a child. You can't live in the back room for the rest of your life. You were fine alone, but now you need a homefor your family. Excuse me. Have some wine. No, thank you, boss. - Yes, Benitez.- How much do we unload? 50 boxes of chicken.I'm generous today. And don't bother me anymore. I told you the first day,if you're loyal, if you work well, if you work very well, I'll reward you. None of my employees leftempty-handed. Not even one. But careful, don't tell anyoneabout the apartment. People are very envious. - Yes, boss.- Now go open the butcher shop. When is your baby due, Gladys? I don't know. How long have you been pregnant? 4 or5 months, I guess. What did the doctor say?What's the estimated date of birth? - I haven't gone to the doctor yet.- But, Santiago! How can it be! You must take her to the hospitalto get an ultrasound! I have no replacement here.Besides, I cannot pay what you said. But it's free! And you have ahospital nearby! Please take her! If you want I can go with youto the hospital tomorrow. Okay, Miss NÃ©lida.Thank you so much! Thank you, Miss NÃ©lida.Here's your order: 1,7 kilos Okay. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon.- Good afternoon. Bromatology. Please, show me theclearance certificate. I don't know what that is. A dispatch slip? Some invoice showingthe name of the owner? Please show me your ID. I don't have it with me. We are starting with the wrong foot.Do you know pink lights are banned? Show me the cold storageand the rest of the shop. Come with me. Closed down This is for you. Come here Santiago! Look what I got for you. Good stuff, for you to mix with the other. That way the clients will notcomplain so much. Move! Motherfuckers! That's it. Don't worry.It will be Okay. Fucking inspectors mess with workersinstead of caring about oligarchy. Come in, honey. Let's see... Where were you? I was here, where I am now, sir. And the knives were there? - No.- In what position were they? This one was here. This one for making breaded cutletswas here. - And this one...- Hi, honey. ...was here, sir. Yes, I know it's Thursday... ...I'm at the butcher shop,running a bit late, it's the reconstruction. I promise I'll go homewhen I leave here. Yes, okay.I can't talk right now. I'll call you later. Bye. ...she was mad. And how did it happen exactly? I remember it well. The boss called me by my name,and I didn't want him to. I didn't want him to call my name I... ...I approached him,I was working with the knife, and I stabbed him. And I kept stabbing him. Good, you remember everything. Tell us. Did you have intentionsof killing him? No... ...I don't know. I wanted to kill himbecause he was going to kill me, and my family. That's why I stabbed himand stabbed him. And we he went outon the street, I stabbed him twice,2 final stabs. That's enough, right? Would you like to add anything else? No, sir. - Well, we're done...- Excuse me, Your Honor, I'd like to show the roomwhere the accused lived. - Okay.- Is it necessary? Thank you very much. This way, gentlemen. Come in. The living conditionsare extreme. Regardless of the constant pressurethe accused received to mask and sell rotting meat. Maybe we should includein the accusations the crimes against public healthcommitted by the accused. On his own or as an accompliceto the victim or someone else. With all due respect, Counselors,don't mess with my life. He probably intoxicatedhalf of the neighborhood. It's not funny. Look what the lady gave me. It's until our house is ready. She said we can give it backthen or not. You don't work in my houseanymore. Go get your things. You're leaving this place,you distract Santiago. What were you thinking, bitch? You gossip to my wife. You fry her brain.She pities you. She comes to bust my balls. Get out of here.You think I'm stupid? - No, I only asked...- Get out of here. Asked what? - Get your things or I'll kill you.- No! But... You're staying here. You're staying herebecause you owe me. You owe me the rentfor the room. You owe me the apartment.So you can't leave until you pay. Is it clear? That bitch is leaving now, butyou'll have to win my trust again. I won't say it again, get out! Grab your things, bitch,because you're done. Get out! Out of here! Be careful, I find out everything. Listen to me, Santiago. I'm doing you a favor. That bitch is going to betray youand me. For real. You'll be better off without her. Come in, sweetie. Go to the back, quickly! Gladys! Go hide, honey! What's up, Santiago?Did you fall asleep? Let's unload this, it stinks.Come on. I have to clean all this upor the butcher shop will stink. Let's go back, Hermogenes. Let's go back to Santiago. What did you doto make the boss so angry? - What? I didn't do anything.- He must have a reason. The boss is always bitchingand abusing. I don't want to raiseour child here. That's why I have to work,so we can have our own house. And what in the meantime? This will end badly. Gladys, we came herebecause you wanted to. Now we have to put up with it.Where will I find a job? Hermogenes. I don't want the boss to see you. It will be best you to leavebefore I open and come back very late. Here. - Hi!- Hi! I'm looking for Gladys Saldivar.Do you know her? - Gladys?- Yes. - The black gate, second floor.- Black gate? Thanks. - Thanks.- Black gate, second floor. Hi, baby. Gladys? Who are you? - Are you a cop?- No, I'm Marcelo Digiovanni, I'm your husband's defenseattorney. I wanted to talk to you,maybe you can help. I don't know. What's the baby's name? Mayra. Hi, Mayra. She's so pretty. Hermogenes misses you bothvery much. How is he? He is pulling it off. Hi, Mayra. My husbandnever took advantage of the boss. He never took a cent from him. And he always mistreated us. Me more, because I answerback. Hermogenes puts upwith everything. He insulted his wife too! Really? But she answered back. She wouldn't shut up. Did Mr. Latuada ever attack you? Latuada hated me, because I had becomefriends with his wife. I told her everythinghe did to us. I defend what is mine. The apartment is ours, we had been paying for itfor months. They want to evict me,but I'm not leaving. How are you, Santiago?Are you Okay? Latuada sent me to help you. Why are sales so low? There's not much going on. You look so serious, pal!Where is the butcher's charm? Is this about your wife? You're better offwithout her. She was a bad seed. Benitez told me he saw herwith some dude. She might be cheating on you. You can have as many broadsas you want, bro. The butcher is a winner. You can't imagine how manyclients I nailed. But you need to take thatlook off your face! Come on. Let's go. Counselor Digiovanni. Thank you for seeing mewithout prior notice, Your Honor. - Excuse me.- Please stay, Nora. Counselor, let me tell you I'm going to grantthe extradition of Perez-Ramallo. Thank you very much, Your Honor. When I saw it was your court,I knew justice would prevail. I wanted to talk to youabout another case, if possible. - Yes!- It's Saldivar homicide case. I will requestanother psychiatric expertise. Besides, Saldivar was being scammedby the victim, so I will requestMr. Latuada's financial records, in addition to his criminal records. Indeed, that is the caseI wanted to talk to you about. Tell me, Counselor. How did you meet the accused? The public defenderwas leading this case, wasn't he? I think it violatesbasic principles of justice when court, instead ofinvestigating the case, assumes the defense of the accused. Needless to say the consequencesit could bring if this irregular situationwas known. I don't want to think the disreputewhich would befall on this court and its staff. Therefore I'm closing theinvestigation stage taking the case to oral trial. Prepare the documents, Nora.I want to sign them before I leave. Yes, Your Honor. And Counselor Digiovanni, whatever you think is missing,request it at the trial. Good evening. Santiago! Come. Here is the payment for your week. Excuse me, boss, do you knowwhen my house will be ready? Soon. It's progressing well. Another thing, I brought you these,they'll make you feel better. You'll be able to rest. Take one at night, another at noon,and everything will be all right. Do as I say. She's beautiful, isn't she? I don't know what to do withSaldivar case. When will you make contact with us? With your family? He has a daughter he hasn't met. - The same age as ours.- You're obsessed with that case. I wonder what's wrong with you. What can I do? He is not helpingand neither I am, apparently. Shouldn't hebe declared incompetent? Or at least consideredheat of passion? I agree with you, but the officialexpert... ...is not even a psychologist. And who did you call as anexpert for the defense? - Nobody. Who would pay for it?- Why didn't you call me? Let's see. It's from the courthouse. Hi, Nora. What? How is he? Is there anything I can do? That's too bad!Call me if anything happens, Okay? - What happened?- Hermogenes tried to kill himself. - How is he?- He's out of the woods. He hit his head. You'll see what your boss bought. This son of a bitch! Come on in! This is confiscated meat,straight from Bromatology. I don't want to be involved. If you dare to file a complaint,I'll be your witness. - How are you?- Fine, thank you, sir. That's good.She's my wife, Clara. She's here to helpwith your defense, okay? Take a seat. How are your wounds? I'm recovering. The doctorwas good. Great. Hermogenes, I'd like to knowwhy you hurt yourself like that. What were you thinking? I thought of my wifeand my daughter. I've killed,and that's unforgivable. I've already suffered a lot... Don't keep blaming yourself,that will not help us... You feel a terrible guiltfor what you did, and that's fine, but understand that guiltand responsibility aren't the same. Tell me about your boss. How was he? He wasn't nice.God didn't make him nice. He was always angry,in a bad mood. He's never greeted me. He made me feel shamemany times. He wasn't the kind of bossthat helps his employees. What is a good boss like? In Santiago del Estero... the boss feels affectiontowards those who work well. You trust him. He doesn't betray. The boss thinks for you. He never makes funof his workers. If this boss was so bad,why didn't you leave the shop? Where would I go? Where would I findanother job? It's not easy. This way I had some moneyto give to Gladys. Besides, I always thoughtthings would get better. He promised me the house,that he'd give me a raise, that he'd give me the moneyhe owed me. Do you think about what you did? In why it happened? Yes, I do. Always. Every day more. And what do you think? I've always been a person that says you shouldn't kill. I think and I insistyou shouldn't kill. And it had to happen to me. The day it happened,it was only in 15 seconds. I killed him in 15 seconds. I... ...I think a lot about it... ...it's as if it were a destinyto fulfill. Do you think your destinywas killing him? Of course. It was like he prepared meto do it. He made me do horrible things. As if I had to pay him with mysadness for him to be happy. I was his... ...his slave. Yes. His trusted slave. Listen!Check this rump! That's impossible to eat!Feel the smell! Do you want this round steak? No, I don't. Keep it. I will never buy here again. Don't leave that there. Hermogenes! What a fuck is this? Why is the meat in bags?What is this shit? Uh? We're carrying out the continuationof the public oral debate provided in the case 3764 against Hermogenes Saldivarfor the crime of aggravated homicide The court is composed ofJudge Berlengo as president, Judges Nestor Galmesand Jorge Ferro as vocals. On behalf of the Public Prosecution,Counselor Pedro Fernandez, and on behalf of the accused,Counselor Marcelo Digiovanni. All rise. You may be seated. The Public Prosecution can continuewith its allegation. Thank you, Mr. President. Having analyzed all the elements, and having listened to the expertsand witnesses, it's clear the motive was hatetowards his employer, as he makes him responsiblefor all his misfortunes, on the fantasythat eliminating him... ...would end all his hardships. There was no physical nor verbalviolence at the time prior to the crime. The accused acted in a cold manner, calculating, with premeditation, without giving the victima chance to defend himself, delivering the first stabtreacherously and taking advantage. On the foregoing, we request Hermogenes Saldivarto be sentenced as criminally responsible forthe crime of aggravated murder to life imprisonmentwith legal expenses and costs. That's all, Mr. President. Good.Is the defense ready to allege? Yes, Your Honor. Very well, go ahead. Mr. Prosecutor you're right,there's no doubt. The fact was exactlyas you described it, That is out of the questionfor this defense and I guessfor everyone in this room. But it seems you are observingand isolated act, a cold file,instead of a human being involved in a terrible tragedy. Did you ask yourselves why? Why a quiet, submissive man commits such a crimeone day in broad daylight and without regard to the witnesses? Have you asked yourselveswho is Hermogenes Saldivar? The Prosecutor requests life imprisonment. I say that Hermogenes alreadysuffered life imprisonment. The imprisonment of illiteracy, of the social exclusion, the snatching of his dignity. The only time the State noticed himwas to name him unsuited. You saw where and howMr. Saldivar lived, how his boss treated him, the workshe was forced to do. And I say boss instead of employer, because there was noemployment relationship just slavery. Along this trial Hermogenes couldn'ttell us what his salary was. This slavery erased his identity,not even his name was safe. Mr. Saldivar received an illusionfor salary. The illusion of a housethat never existed, a home where he could finallybe with his family that he had been forcedto turn away from. The official psychological expertise says there was no heat of passionbecause at the moment of the attack there was no triggerto provoke him. The D.A. Said there was no violenceprior to the act. But there was a trigger indeed. What's a bigger triggerthan slavery? What's a bigger trigger thanbeing set apart from his family? When Hermogenesheard Latuada say his name, he knew what was coming. The accumulated pressuredid the rest and released an emotional hurricanethat he couldn't contain, it darkened his conscience,and hastened the crime. I ask you to what pointis it possible to exploit a man? Mr. President,with all due respect, taking in account the circumstancesaround this crime, I request the homicide to beconsidered under heat of passion and Mr. Saldivar to be sentencedwith a minimum of 3 years provided by Article 81of the penal code, also, taking into accountthe time already served, and the lack of prior records, I request his immediaterelease to be ordered, because it's fair. It's this one. - It's this one.- Yes, I think so. What's up, little girl? Your tickets, Hermogenes. I don't know how to thankeverything you're doing for me, for us. No, you don't need to thank me. Count on me for whatever you want. I'm used to hard work,so whatever you need I'm here. You have to take careof your family now. A pleasure. - Thanks a lot, Counselor.- You're welcome. - Are we leaving?- Sure. - Did you notice how he treated you?- No, I didn't. How? As if you were his new boss. - I didn't notice.- He did. Did you see what he said and the way he said it? The real Hermogeneswas sentenced to two years in prison for homicide under heat of passion. The fulfillment of the sentencewas left in suspense and he recovered his freedom. The Boss, anatomy of a crime.
