- This way please, Mak Sir. - Okay. Have some, miss. I promise you won't get AIDs. You're crazy! - How much is it? - Seven dollars. Hey Baldy, working late? Aren't you scared? - Of what? - This store has been robbed several times. I see. You're a cop. - Here. - Fifteen dollars in all. - Don't move! - Freeze! Or I'll blow your head off. Empty the register! That gun is fake, this one's real. Drop your knives. Drop them! You piece of crap... how dare you hit me! Don't move! - Stand back or I'll shoot. - Go ahead. Shoot me. Here's where the heart is. Get a good aim. I'll mark the spot for you. Make sure you aim properly. Wow, it actually sticks. Go on, shoot me. Come on... So you like being a robber, huh? How dare you retaliate? Freeze! Drop it. - I said, drop it. - You drop it. You're the crook! Drop it! I'll skewer you! Hey, where did my fork go? Cut it out or I'll call the police! Call the police? I am the police! - Cheung! - Scabby! Freeze or I'll shoot! - No! - Don't shoot us, sir. Scared now? You scumbags! Stand over there! Who is your boss? Move aside! Come here! "With Baldy around, all the crooks are going down." Don't you know that? - I've heard that before. - Who is your boss? - Johnny. - Johnny? He's my buddy. You should have told me earlier. Come here. I heard that Johnny is doing pretty well lately. Didn't he take care of you guys? Where does he hang around these days? Who is he working for? Save your efforts, sir. Do you think we would actually betray our boss? What can you pin on us? - Just robbery. - That's right. And the maximum penalty for that is merely two to three years imprisonment. - Go ahead, arrest us. - Oh yeah? Two to three years? I'm arresting you for robbery, resisting arrest... illegal possession of weapons and snatching a police officer's gun. Your fingerprints are all over my gun. You're going to be in jail until the cows come home. - Is that a threat? - No, it's a promise. So speak up if you know what's good for you. Make me happy and I'll let you off. Otherwise, be prepared to rot in prison! - Hear that? - Hear that? Hey, sir... - I'll tell you everything! - It's about time. - My boss is working for Prince Tak. - I knew that. My boss is the chauffeur for Prince Tak's drug deals. I know that too. I swear that's all I know, sir. You haven't told me where I could find him. I really don't know, sir. If I knew these things, I wouldn't be a small-time robber. I beg you, sir. I swear I've told you everything I know. What a complete waste of my time. Get lost. - Really? - Scram! Let's go! Take your weapons with you. You won't have to buy new ones for your next heist. - Thank you, sir... - You're welcome. Let's go! We really got off lucky. Freeze! CID! A robbery? Up against the wall, now! Come on, sir. That bald cop inside agreed to let us off. Shut up! Put your hands against the wall. - Stand still. - Hey Fatty, fancy seeing you here. - Baldy, got the information? - Half of it. Are you kidding? How could you let them go without getting all the information? They said the information is for your ears only. He's here now. Go on, tell us. I never said that. It's no use looking at me. In there, I'm in charge. Out here, he's the boss. It's out of my hands. - What do you want from us? - Ask him, not me. - What has he told you? - Nothing we didn't already know. - No new information? - He refused to talk. Why didn't you tell him everything? Trying to make things difficult for us? - Where is your boss? - I really don't know. I would have told Baldy if I know. I think he's telling the truth. Let him off. - Get lost! - Thank you, sir! Come back here! Baldy might fall for your tricks, but I won't! - Spit it out right now or else! - I'll talk... What? You know where he is? So you've been lying to me all along? Fine, I'm charging him with armed robbery. Here's the evidence. I'll call for a police car now. This will get you at least seven years in jail. Wait! I'll talk! But you must let me off if I tell you Johnny's whereabouts. - I don't do bargains, scumbag! - Come on, be nice to him. Tell us, where your boss is. He hangs around the game centre on Pak Tai Street. - How reliable is your information? - I wouldn't dare lie to you. All right, get lost. - Thank you, sir. - Just go. - Thank you. - Scram. - Robbery! - Robbery! - Stand right there! - Police! Freeze! That's the game centre. Shut up and get out. Hey Baldy, that car over there is parked with the engine running. Don't look at him! He kept the engine running for the air-conditioning. But the car windows are rolled down. He rolled them down because he's smoking! Look at all those cigarette butts on the ground. Something must be up. - He must be waiting for someone. - It's none of our business. We're here to catch Johnny. Let's go. I think there's a robbery somewhere. There's Johnny! Hey, Johnny! Stand right there! - Police! Where is the alarm? - I don't know. - Help! Robbery! - Where? Where's the robbery? The third floor! Number three to eight, Ngai Ching Jewellery Company. - How many robbers are there? - About six or seven. Are they armed? They have knives and guns and they are all masked. Don't worry. Come with me. CID here, I'll pay for this later. Let me through! Block his way instead! Get out of my way... Bingo! Why did you hit me? Scumbag! How dare you run from me! That's a strike! I've got you! How dare you make me run after you! Please don't hurt me, Baldy. You know how much I look up to you. I know it's empty flattery but man, it sounds good. All right, I'll play nice. Lately, Prince Tak has been going around in a Benz and dating celebrities. What's up with that? I don't know. Is the new drug lord, Cocaine Wing, his brother? - I know nothing. - Really? You chauffeur him everywhere. How could you not know? I swear I know nothing. Fine. Sir, what are you arresting me for? No idea, but I'll come up with something. You're too darn slow! Hurry or I'll kill you! Grab everything! Get down and don't move! Do you hear me? I said, get down! What are you looking at? Hurry! Are you done? Soon! Keep a close guard out there! Hurry! Are they masked? Yes. What's going on here? Stay still or I'll blow your head off! Don't move! Hurry up! Give me your wallet! Hurry! Hand them over! Give it to me! Hey buddy, hurry! Hurry, we have to go! Hurry up, guys! - What are you doing? - Robbing the store, of course! Hey, we have another robber here. I think I got the wrong store. I'm sorry. Carry on, don't mind me. Police! Drop your weapons and surrender! Get in! Hurry! - Thought of something? - Not yet. Stop right there! A robbery? Perfect! I'm the police. I need to commandeer your cart. Out of my way! Hey, Fatty. Look who I've arrested. Oh no! Thank you for tipping us off to this robbery. Please come with me to identify the suspects. What are you talking about? I refuse. But those robbers deserve a good look at the man who snitched on them. You're making me look like a snitch. This will get me killed! Well, that's your problem. Maybe now you'll cooperate with us. All right... I'll tell you what I know. Spit it out. Prince Tak has a drug transaction at Yu Tak Plaza tomorrow. Who is the dealer? It's a man disguised as a woman. He hides the drugs in his bra. This better be true. You two are lunatics. I wouldn't dare lie to you. - What did you say? - No... - I mean you two are kind and merciful. - I'll let you off this once. What about this? Hey, it's settled. Uncuff him. Go away. - Hey, we're on duty. - Oh, leave me alone! I don't usually get to cry. We're here to find our suspect, not for you to cry your heart out. Look for him yourself. Walk around or something. How do I identify him? He'll look like a woman, just one that's unnaturally endowed. It must be her. Go and check her out. I don't know how to do that. Why don't you show me? Not bad, Fatty. You're getting smarter. - I learnt my tricks from you. - Little rascal. Heads or tail? Heads. It's tail. - Go on. - Don't go away. All right. Hey miss, what brand is your jacket? Lai, it's that guy from last time. - Watch out for him. - I will. - You're a pervert! - Yeah, I have lousy taste in women. Molester! Why did you stick your hand into my blouse? It's a misunderstanding! I'm sorry. - This is outrageous! - Miss, I'm the police. I've been keeping an eye on this pervert for a long time. - Just leave him to me. - You're a cop? Of course. Something's up. Look over there. Aren't you supposed to be arresting him? Why are you two still here? You two are in cahoots. - You got it wrong, miss. - I bet that baldy is a pervert too! - Stay where you are. I'm calling the cops! - Let go of me! Don't worry, just follow me. Hi, miss. - Did two women just come in? - Yes. - CID. We need to go in. - Men are not allowed in there! And the goods? - CID! Calm down! - We're on an investigation here! - What's the big deal? - Hey Baldy, over there. - Go away, he's mine! - Let me do it! Come back here! Gotcha! Baldy! Are you okay? She's getting away! After her! She's a man in disguise. Frisk her! Found anything? - What's wrong? - Do it yourself. You're useless. You pervert! Get your hands off me! Oh no. Miss, you said you were molested by two police officers. Could you identify them? Number three and four. Number three and four are to stay behind. The rest may leave. Turn to your left! Darn you, Fatty! You got me to frisk her even though you knew she's really a woman. You said I should always share my good fortune with you. Turn to your right. - I said turn to your right! - All right! I wouldn't have you for company otherwise. Prince Tak wants you to press the charges. Inspector Wu. My client is certain those two are the men who molested her. We would like to press charges. Surrender your pistols at the armoury and wait for me in my office. What the heck? We're being prosecuted by crooks now? - What is the world coming to? - They can't hear us. I don't care! Thank you, Inspector Wu. - Baldy, what is Fatty going on about? - He's just swearing at them. - Inspector Wu! - What are you going to do about this? We're just trying to talk some sense into her. Listen to me, lady... Prince Tak is just using you. - You should stop working for him. - That's right. Prince Tak... I don't know who Prince Tak is. What I do know is that the two of you molested me. I wouldn't have frisked you if I knew you were a woman. This looks more like a grope. If he was so desperate for a grope, we'd have gone to a massage parlour instead. Inspector Wu, did you hear how offensive they were? Inspector Wu, order them to shut up at once. Or I'll lodge a complaint with ICAC. Cool your jets. Shut up, guys. They have shut up We will handle this case impartially. Sergeant, please bring them out for the paperwork. This way, please. - Boss? - Boss? Am I good or what? We started out patrolling the streets together. I've made it to Inspector while the two of you are still officers. What's your secret to success? I use my brains. Unlike you guys. Letting that drug dealer who was disguised as a woman get away... and getting prosecuted by a real woman for molesting. How dumb is that? - So do we need to surrender our pistols? - Of course not. - Boss will fix it for us. - Sure. And that's how I end up with only two pips left on my shoulder. - I know we've made things hard for you. - No, we haven't. - We better go. - Good idea. - We'll be off then. - Sure. Is there something else you need to talk about? - No... - No... - Wasn't Boss awesome? - Sheesh. Everyone knows what the two of you did. Come on, show us how you "frisk" your suspects. Fine, I'll show you! Hey Fatty, bring us along on your "investigations" next time. Hey, look. Is she new? I haven't noticed this butt before. Neither have I. She looks like she'll be an easy lay. I can tell from her butt. Who's talking behind my back? How could you be so crude and vulgar? I know it was you, Baldy. You're the biggest flirt in our station. Clever girl! Come here... Ching, I heard that your three sisters are all stunners. They are all married. - Hi, Dragon. - Hi. - You said you'd get me two concert tickets? - Oh, yes. It slipped my mind. Here. I see. You queued for four and a half hours just to get tickets for Ching. - How much is it? - It's all right. That won't do. I'll pay you back later. - Thanks. - Sure, you're welcome. I didn't know you're interested in her. Don't be silly, she's just a little girl. I'm seven years her senior. Just seven? Cut it out. We have work to do. - Let's go! - Seven years indeed. Boss Wing is in there, Prince Tak. How may I help you? - Brother. - Boss Wing. Boss Wing. - Tak, you're here. - Boss Wing. Don't call me boss. Just call me Brother Wing. These days, all the big bosses are sitting behind bars. Come on, take a seat. Please have a seat. Grab a seat too, Johnny. You're one of us. Take a seat... We owe this meal to Bill who gave me some tips on horse racing. I bet on some other horses instead and I won 200 grand. Tell him. Brother Wing, I'm very sorry about what happened today... This isn't your fault. Tak is in the wrong here. You should have left such matters to your followers... instead of doing it personally. It was just sheer bad luck, Brother. We bumped into those two cops. I'll kill them if they cross my path again. Don't you mess with them. They are known as Crazy Tiger and Mad Dragon in our field. Provoke them and they'll hound you for life. Let's see what they can do to me. Word on the street is that the two of them are out to get you. Why me? You've been far too showy. You don't see them bothering me... even though I'm the notorious Cocaine Wing. A word of advice, seek the limelight only if you're doing charity. Drug dealers should keep a low profile. Don't you think so, Johnny? Don't worry, Brother. Today's incident was just bad luck. According to my sources, someone tipped the cops to our deal. How could that be? We kept this deal under wraps. Only Johnny and Lai knew about it. They wouldn't betray us. Do you really think so? I don't even trust you and you're my very own brother. I have people monitoring your every move. No one can hide anything from me. You may think I'm scheming but I'm just being careful. It's for the greater good of everyone. Today's deal... was sabotaged by one of us! Get rid of him! I can explain this, Boss Wing! Please give me a chance... Uncle Wai. Uncle Wai? Uncle Wai? - Yes, Boss? - Arrange for his funeral. - He was one of us after all. - Funeral? Sure... - Cheers, everyone. - Cheers... Lai? Drink up. Cheers. Come on. Cheers. Don't do this, please. I don't want to die just yet. Today's job is a piece of cake. Just get us in there so we can bug the place. And you have to check the house out. Don't rat us out if you get caught in there. - You know what loyalty is, don't you? - Yes. No... stop shaking me. Let me down, please. What's wrong with the two of you? - I apologise. - Get the door open. Hey Baldy, we never play by the rules. - It's no wonder we're still just officers. - What? We're bugging a suspect's place without a permit. You and your mad ideas. We'll never be able to close a case if we play by the book. He's out. It's done, sir. There's no one in there. Frisk me. No... that tickles. Stop it... - Keep your nose clean. - Be good. Any dogs inside? No. There's a d-dog here. CID! Put your hands up! Get over there. Up against the wall. Frisk him, Fatty. Scared? All right, get out. What? Upset? Bite me. I've got rid of him. Let's get cracking. Bobby? - What should we do? - Hide! Hide under the bed. Hey, let me in. Full house! Fatty, you lucky dog. - Did you get a nice eyeful? - Yeah, I got a nice eyeful of nothing. You didn't see a thing? What a pity. I'll take a look. - She's taking us to court, remember? - Big deal. She's pressing charges anyway. An additional charge won't matter. - You're a cop, for goodness' sake. - Lai? Lai? Get lost. - Full house. - Traitorous fatso! Lai. You're here. What are your thoughts on yesterday's debacle? Is there really a mole among us? I don't know about that. But I do know that those two mad cops are like 7-Eleven. In operation twenty-seven. You better watch your back. What can they do to me? So what if they are cops? The legal system in Hong Kong protects people like us. That's why we drive a Benz while they take the bus. Whatever you say. Just count me out for your deals. Get someone else to do it. Lai, wrap up this one last deal for me. - Brother Wing wants your men to do it. - Don't be silly. - What are you doing? - I trust you over my men any time. Don't... - Did you fart? - No. Pak! - Yes, Boss? - Get our guns ready. Who is paging me? Don't move! This is a holdup! Freeze! Put your hands in the air! Lift the bed up. Hurry. Darn it. Since when are crooks such an obedient bunch? What are you staring at? You've never seen us before. Finally came to your senses, my friend? Being a crook pays better than being a cop. Bloody scumbag. How dare you deal in drugs and frame us for molestation. - Hit me, come on. - Freeze! You drive a Benz while we take the bus? Give me your car keys! Move aside, scumbag. Come to me, Lai. Don't worry, you're one of us. - Let's go. - No... Hurry! Get in! Remember what I said. Bye! What did he say to you? - Nothing. - Nothing? Yes, nothing! What did you whisper in her ear? I told her she's beautiful and she deserves a better man. You're interested in her? No, you idiot. I want to divide and conquer them. Wow, it's fully automated. Much better than that piece of junk you drive. That's why I was so mad. We're all earning a living here. But drug dealers get to drive a Benz while law enforcers can barely afford a car. You're even worse off. You don't even have a bicycle. Hello, yes? - Return me my car, scumbags! - Sorry, no scumbags here. Return me my car, or else! No scumbags here, but we do have a windbag. Please hold. Your call. Hi, this is the windbag speaking. How may I help you? You darn fatso! I'm right behind you! Go faster if you dare! Do you see me? You'll never be able to pay for any damages you make to my car. What did he say? He said a scumbag like you won't be able to pay for any damages to his car. I hate being called a scumbag. What did you call me, you cretin? Pull over and fight me if you dare! That's it! I've had enough of him! I need to teach him a lesson. You bloody scumbag! There's nothing I detest more than being challenged. I can't afford to pay for the damages? Fine, I'll wreck your car then! That feels great. Come and get me... - You need to speed up. - You idiot! - Faster, come on... - Pull over! Fatty, he wants us to pull over. - Boss! Are you okay? - Get out of my way! He's catching up. Don't let him overtake us. Swerve right. This is fun! I'll show you a trick, Fatty. Let him overtake us on my side. Come on...! You smashed my car, you moron! Like your car's new look? After them! Faster! - Are you having fun, Fatty? - Oh yeah! It's your turn to have some fun. Go ahead! Okay! Watch this! Boss! Look! You're even meaner than I am! Look what you did to my car, you scumbags! We have great chemistry, Fatty. I can just see the sparks flying! - Any other tricks up your sleeve? - I'll show you a whopper. - Great! - Hold on tight! - No! - My car! - Look who will be taking buses now. - Baldy, let's go! Taxi! - Stop right there! - Stop right there! - Taxi...! - Excuse me, please. What happened to that car? - Where to? - Just get us out of here. - Bye! - Bye! I'll get you for this! Table for how many, sir? One. I can take care of myself. Hello, gorgeous. - Have we met before? - How corny. - May I join you? - Have I given you permission? I have my reasons for sitting here. I can't read the menu, it's in Italian. - Maybe you could help me out? - Ask the maitre d' instead. I don't want to ask him. I prefer asking beautiful ladies for help. Especially one as classy and elegant as you. Well, why didn't you come earlier then? I've already finished my dinner. You're two hours late. This is ridiculous! I was working, honey. You're an idiot... What are you laughing at? You're really cute when you get angry. You can give me a proper scolding when we're home. - Waiter! - Bill, please. Bill, please. - It's a total of $180, sir. - Here's $200. - Keep the change. - Thank you. Wow, you're really something. Fancy managing to get a girlfriend that's so tall. It doesn't matter when we're both lying down. Try it for yourself. - Dad, I'm home. - All right, set the table. - Auntie San? Auntie San! - What's the matter? I saw your son in another street protest. Tell him to stop doing that. Those protestors always clash with the police. My son is a police officer. So what? It'll be awkward if they do meet. Persuade him to join hunger strikes instead. Hunger strikes are bad for the health. Don't worry. Youngsters can fast up to seven days without harm. Take it as cleansing the system. It's great for health. - Dad! Dinner's ready. - Coming. Dad, are you sure it's really okay for someone to fast for seven days? Well, I don't know for sure. I was thrown into labour camp after going on a hunger strike for three days. Hong Kong is a wonderful place. We mustn't destroy it. Otherwise we'll be doing exactly what those darn Caucasians expected of us. What did they say? They say there is no such thing as a free Chinese. To be Chinese is to be a slave. Let's drink a toast for us Chinese. Cheers. - How was your day? - It was all right. Baldy and I wrecked someone's car. But there wasn't any cross fire. Oh well, my boy. Leave it all to fate. Be true to your conscience and fate will always be on your side. Come on, let's drink up. Cheers. What's so funny? What is the difference between getting married and co-habiting? The former is a death sentence and the latter, a suspended death sentence. It's only a matter of time before you die. That's not funny at all. Go and take your shower. Do I have to? I showered yesterday. Mom wants to know when we'll be getting married. You feign sleep every time I bring this up. Don't you dare reach for your pager. I knew it. You use your pager to get out of this discussion every time. Someone really is paging me. Yeah, right. You have a call, Miss Ng. Prince Tak, he returned the page. You're that lady who's accusing me of molestation, aren't you? Well, what do you want? Are you free tonight? Could you come out for a chat? - Sure, let's talk. - I don't wish to talk over the phone. I'll meet you and Fatty an hour later... at the construction site behind Prince Restaurant. See you then. Well done, Lai. Fatty! Fatty! What took you so long? You said you'd be here in an hour. I had to get two air tickets first. Get in. Come here. Go in from the front. I'll sneak in from the back. If she asks for me right off the bat, victory will be ours. Are you sure your plan will work? I don't know about others, but he'll definitely fall for it. Because he's as dumb as you are. Oh yes, shout if anything goes wrong. Let's get moving... Hey, Fatty! Come up here. Fatty. You came alone? Where's Baldy? He couldn't make it. He said to pass you two air tickets and tell you not to be late for your flight. Air tickets? Yeah. Baldy's girlfriend found out about you and went berserk on him. But Baldy said he'll definitely be at the airport. What nonsense are you spouting now? My job's done. - Blessings to you two. - Hey... "T. Mak"? Who's that? It's Tiger Mak. That's Baldy's name. You should know that. I'm sorry, this is between the three of you. I shouldn't stick my nose in. I'll be going now. Please let me through. No wonder they showed up at the shopping mall... and in your apartment. Darn it! How dare you betray me? Are you out of your mind? You actually believe him? No wonder your brother thinks you're an imbecile. - An imbecile? - No... How dare you talk to me this way? Stop it! Your personal affairs are none of my business. But she is my buddy's girl. Touch her again and I'll arrest you. Shut up with your nonsense, Fatty! This is a set-up! - Don't listen to him! He's lying... - Shut up! Get her out of here. Fatty, I asked you here to talk business. We're all busy people so I'll just get straight to the point. How much do you want? Quote me a price. Are you trying to buy me off? I'm going to charge you for bribery. Do you have a witness? Of course, my buddy's girl. Stop spouting nonsense! - Follow me to the station. - Don't move. You have two options now, Fatty. Work for me and strike a fortune... or cease living altogether. I don't want your dirty money. Fatty... how dare you go against me! - What's wrong with you? - I'm scared. I haven't even laid a finger on you. Shut up! Kill him! Stop pushing me! - Move it! - Let go of me! - Take your hands off me! - Move it... Bingo! You scumbag! Why did you set me up? So what if I did? Bite me! You groped me again! - Get away from me! - How dare you touch my woman! - I'll teach you to do that again! - Baldy! Why did you set me up? Kill him! Bingo! Bingo! - Why did you set me up? - It's for your own good! - That's nonsense! - Don't make me hit you. I warned you. - Go to hell, Baldy! - Cut it out! - Listen to me, Lai... - You witch! - Elope with me. - I'll make you pay for this! Don't listen to him, Tak! She's really done for, Fatty! Get that scumbag! - You're going to get me killed! - You hit me? Go to hell! I'm trying to save your hide! You'll come to a sorry end if you stay with Prince Tak, silly wench. Didn't your mom teach you anything? One must live with a clear conscience, with his head held up high. Do not behave like a beast, with no integrity and morals. Or you'll be a beast in your next life! I have no idea what you're saying. It's the philosophy of life. It's so profound that I don't get it either. The point is if you don't cooperate with me, you'll be doomed. Stop right there! Stop right there! Hey, watch where you're going! Get out of my way! Get out of my way! What's going on! - That man looks like Fatty. - It can't be him. What are you doing? - See? I told you it's him. - It's you! Boss! You darn rascal! My ear! You idiot. How dare you wreck the Commissioner's wedding banquet? This time round, I won't be able to save you. I can't hear a thing. Let me arrest him first. Move aside! Scumbag! I'll flatten you... Fatty! Lend me a hand. Let's mash him to pulp! Stop it... - Why are our colleagues all here? - Inspector Wu is here too. - Good luck to you. - Pray real hard. - What are they talking about? - Thanks. Hey! The Chief Inspector and the Prosecuting Attorney are here too! - The bridegroom looks familiar... - Poor guy, he's injured. Crap. It's the Commissioner. We're done for. What do we do? Let's get out of here. Stop right there! We've been buddies for more than a decade. I've bailed you guys out of trouble without a word of complaint time and again. But look at the mess you've made this time. Why don't you tell me what I can possibly do to save you? We deserve to be reprimanded. You can finally reveal your true colours to us. What the heck! So what if you're after some crook? You can't be so reckless! Giving me nothing but trouble every darn time! You guys would have driven me to my grave... if I aren't such an amicable and nice guy. Wrecking the Commissioner's wedding, of all the dumb things to do! You two numbskulls! Thanks to the two of you... I'm the lowest-ranking inspector in the station. - Boss... - Don't bother... Just get out of my sight! Where are you two going? Getting out of your sight. Going back to work. You don't have any more work to do. Please get out of Hong Kong. Let me have a few days of peace. What about our investigation on Prince Tak? - And aren't we being sued for molestation? - That's right. Those charges have been dropped. That lady has agreed to be the prosecution's witness. She'll be testifying against Prince Tak. Case closed. Your services are no longer required. Game over. - No second chances? - Dream on! - Let's go, Fatty. - Don't go just yet. Get back here. Sit down... Take some time off and go on a holiday. Give me a few weeks to do the bootlicking and the groveling. Once the Commissioner calms down, you guys can come back to work. - Let's go to Macau, Fatty! - Attention! - Yes, sir! - What are you doing? Sit down. Attention! Stand up. Aren't you something? Everyone is talking about what a fiasco my wedding turned out to be. I've been made the laughing stock of the Hong Kong police force. Get rid of these two raving lunatics now. Otherwise, I'll hold you personally responsible! Yes, sir! Get them out! Now! I will... Out! Out! Hi. Hi, Dragon. Ask her out if you like her so much. At least you'll find out if the feeling's mutual. - What if she turns me down? - You won't know unless you ask. Maybe she'll even join us on our vacation. Do it. Go on! - Ching. - Yes? I like you a lot. I'd like to ask you out. You'll probably turn me down. But I'd still like to hear it from you. - How did it go? - I don't know. What do you mean? I don't know. Here, your wedding invite. She's getting married. You can give it up now. Let's go on vacation. "Singapore" Cheer up, Fatty. You can have your pick of gorgeous women here. - You make it sound so easy. - I'll definitely get you a girl. - After you grab all the pretty ones? - Not this time. - Are you sure? - That's me, always looking out for you. Yeah, right. What's going on? Engine problems? Sorry about this. Look! Quick! Someone must have fallen into the sea. Sorry, Mister. I didn't see you coming. It's okay. I'm fat enough to cushion myself. I'm sorry, miss. It's that fatso's fault I crashed into you. - Are you all right? - I'm fine. You look kind of familiar. Have we met before? - No. - Really? Get up! Sorry about this. - My back hurts! - I'll help you up. Stop pulling me! Let go! - Are you okay? - Are you all right, Mister? She kneed me in the groin. What do you think? Come on, we have work to do! - Miss, I'm sure we've met before. - Are you okay? I'm all right. Just look at them. We'll be right back. - Police... - We're the Hong Kong police. - We're the police! - What's going on here? - Did someone drown? - Has someone died? No, we're just waiting for the sunset. - What? The sunset? - That's right. It'll set behind that statue over there. - It'll be beautiful. - It's just a sunset, big deal. - No one watches the sunset in Hong Kong. - That's because we have no sunset. Baldy! Come here, quick! She's calling me? I'm in luck today! Coming! A traffic police made your taxi driver drive off. - He left your luggage over there. - Hurry. Get our luggage. I'd like to apologise to you on that fatso's behalf. We crashed into you because he was running so fast. - I'm really sorry. - It's all right. This is our first time in Singapore. We've booked our rooms but we don't know our way to the hotel. Could you kindly show us the way there? Let's not trouble them. They're jogging. No, they aren't. Not after you crashed into them and injured them. They don't know us, they might think we're up to no good. Do I look like that sort? Let me introduce myself. Hi, I'm Baldy Mak. He's Fat Dragon. What's your name? - I'm May. - And I'm June. Let go! Sorry for crashing into you. Fatty would like to apologise by treating you all to dinner. Are the two of you free tonight? - Thanks, bye. - Thanks, bye. - What does that mean? - We've been turned down! This is all your fault! You sounded just like a lecher! It's no wonder they fled from us. - Did I even open my mouth? - Let's go. Carry it yourself! Look, they're here. Hi... Stop... - Hi! - Oh, shut up. They're calling me, not you. Don't you know my English name is "Hi"? Pay the fare. Get in, I'll drive you to your hotel. Perfect. You're one heck of a woman. Hey, that's June's seat. It's all right, you can have the seat. I'm giving you chances. Hold my hand, June. Or you might fall. It's just the disco. Why must we get all dressed up? We're not going there to dance. We're going there to get girls. Those girls don't suit us. We'll make do with them for now. - There's no way they'll fall for us. - Who cares. As long as we like them. Look at you! You walk like an old fogey. You'll never get a girl. I'll show you the hip way of walking. - This way, please. - This way, please. - Hey, I know this song. - Me, too! - I'll sing it. - All right! Let's sing together, miss. - Let him have this turn. - Thanks. Idiot! Look what you did! - Hey, jump in... - Come on. - Join us! - Come on, hurry. Let's play a trick on her. Help, my legs are cramping. Dunk him! Now this is what I call living. Enjoying yourself, Fatty? It'd be great if we could do this once a month. Dream on. In our line of work... we don't even get days off. Unless you plan on quitting. - Why don't we find a job here instead? - Doing what? Be gigolos? You're too fat. Tall Girl wouldn't agree to it even if you do. Who is Tall Girl? She is... his mom. - Is his mom very tall? - Yes, as tall as you are. What were you guys talking about? We're thinking of quitting our jobs in Hong Kong and making a living here. - But we don't know what we can do. - You can start up a karaoke lounge. - With what? My life? - Of course not. Singapore is a safe country. To start a business, all you need is money. He has everything except money. He has everything but shame. Well, one other thing he lacks is morals! How about you? Fatty lacks money, and I lack capital. That's not a problem. We can come up with the capital. How do we split the profits? Thirty-seventy? Forty-sixty? How about fifty-fifty? We'll provide the capital while you guys run the business. - Wouldn't we be living off women then? - Of course not, we'll be working. We'll have to run the business. All right, you've convinced me. I support bourgeois liberalisation. What's that? - I have no idea. - Is it something good? - It's good, but not too stable. - Let's draft the basic law. - Good idea. - Let's get started. Hey Baldy, you're back. Yes, we came back to tender our resignation. Missing us already? Aren't you guys feeling the least bit sad? We've been colleagues for years. Won't you guys miss us? - We'll miss you, of course. - And we're green with envy. The two of you get to migrate to Singapore and live off women. Will you miss us? Tell us how you really feel. My boyfriend will be able to rest easy knowing that you're no longer here. Just kidding. All of us will miss you guys dearly. Ching is a wonderful girl indeed. She deserves a kiss. Kiss her, Fatty. - I'll kiss you on your wedding day. - Really? - I'll hold you to it. - Hey, that's enough! - Stop pushing me! - Move it. - Calm down. - I can walk by myself. Sit. I said sit down! Were you at Ho Man Tin Street last Saturday? What's last Saturday's date? Ho Man Tin Street is one long street. Which part of it do you mean? Why did you hit me? I didn't hit you. He did. Why did you hit me? How dare you hit me again? I was assaulted by the police. I'm a cop. Those two aren't. - Feel free to retaliate. - Fine! Forget it. What? You two are quitting? You found two women who would finance your karaoke lounge in Singapore? Which means you're going to be kept men? Good for you two. Boss, we're really sorry about this. You had to clean up the mess we made and now we're resigning. Oh well, we're just looking out for ourselves. - It's been hard on you, Boss. - Not really. The mess you made was too big for me to handle. - What does that mean? - Are we fired? Are you kidding? - How could you? - Calm down. Do we get severance pay? You'll get three months' salary. But if you resign, you'll need to pay us three months' worth of salary. All right, just lay us off... No, I insist on resigning. Come on, it's the same thing. No, it's not! This is a matter of principles. We risked our necks to arrest Prince Tak. How could you fire us for that? Forget Prince Tak. He has been granted bail. What? Our efforts to nab him are all for naught then. This is no longer any of our business. We're going to Singapore. - But that's not the point! - Let's go. Come on. Have you talked to Tall Girl about this? Is she fine with it? It's no big deal. I'll let her know about it later. Let's go. Bye! Baldy, how should we deal with this scumbag? Go ahead and punch me if you dare. Leave him be. He'll get his comeuppance someday. Calm down. Think of our karaoke lounge. - What an imbecile. - Baldy, did you hear that? - No, what? - He called you an imbecile. - What's that? - It means blithering idiot. Forget it. He's right. You are an idiot at times. - Let's go. - Am I, really? - Big Brother. - Boss Wing. You should know better than to take them on. Don't worry. They may try to charge me with bribery and assault. But with no witnesses, they can't do anything to me. You don't know what you've got yourself into. Don't you know that Lai has agreed to testify against you? She betrayed me? I'm going to kill her. Don't worry, I've already hired two killers from Thailand. - Leave those two cops to me. - Let the killers handle this. Aren't you in enough trouble as it is? - Are the killers from Thailand here yet? - Yes. - Are you ready? - All prepared. Okay. Let's go. Breakfast is ready. Would you like me to bring it out? It's all right. I'll come in and get it myself. Over. Cheung, get a load of that! What are you looking at? We're on duty here. I saw them first. - Leave one for me. - Yeah, whatever. - Hi. - Hi. - What time is it? - It's nine... - Use a tray, Yip Sir. - Thanks. Your colleague left his jacket behind after his shift last night. Oh yes, why hasn't Baldy been around? He has resigned. He'll be starting up a karaoke lounge with Fatty in Singapore. - Send them my congratulations. - I will. You rascal. I doubt you'll want any breakfast now. - Come in. - I'm getting a piece of the action too? Bobby! Bobby! Here, I need the plate. Bring it out. "The girls in Singapore are beautiful..." You're in a great mood, Fatty. You must have met someone in Singapore. - No... - Is she pretty? - She's not bad. - How about Baldy's girl? - Not bad. - Don't worry. Baldy has told me all about it. He even said his girl is prettier than yours. There's nothing great about his girl. You're taller and prettier than her. She's just rich, that's all. She agreed to come up with the capital for Baldy's karaoke lounge in Singapore. "The girls in Singapore are beautiful..." Don't tell Tall Girl about our plans, all right? I haven't told her a thing. Here... Let's tuck in. I cooked this meal especially for you. Try my cooking. Why are you just having plain rice? You usually eat more. Here, try my cooking. It's pretty good. You darn scoundrel! Come with me! What's wrong? Come here! You! Come with me! Sit down! Why must you go to Singapore? You can live off me. I can finance your karaoke lounge. Leave if you like Singapore that much! Get out! Let's go. Take your stuff with you! Don't ever come back! Go to Singapore and sponge off women. You want to dump me? Over my dead body! Let's go. What are you staring at? Darn you, Baldy. You jerk! What do you want? Time really flies. I've known you for three years, Fatty. Three years? It's more like ten years! I've treated you as a brother in these ten years. You don't have to worry about me. Just tell me honestly... if I choose to stay here with Tall Girl... - Will you still go to Singapore? - Of course I will. How could you desert your buddy? Traitor! But you said I didn't have to worry about you. - I didn't mean it, idiot! - How would I know that? Tall Girl is paging me. - Go back now and apologise. - What's the hurry? Go back now! Waiter! Bill, please. All right, you can pick up the bill. I'll go home and make up with her now. I'm footing the bill again? Don't make a sound! You'll get Tall Girl killed. Don't tell anyone upstairs that I'm here. Or you'll be killed too. Tall Girl! Tall Girl? Bingo! Tall Girl... Thank goodness you're all right. Man, this is the best conversation we've ever had. I can get a word in edgeways for once. You rat! Are you still going to Singapore? Now is not the time for this. - I want an answer now! - Fine, I'm not going! - When are we getting married? - We have to fix a date first. No way! Watch out! Run, Tall Girl! Don't worry about me. Go to hell! Let's go! Don't worry, Tall Girl. We're safe now. - Go to hell, you scumbag! - We're still in danger! Stop attacking me! - Go to hell! - Why are you hitting me? Hit her, Tall Girl. I don't hit girls. - Arrest him! He tried to kill her! - What's going on here? - Baldy, it's you! - Yeah, it's me. There are two Caucasians upstairs who tried kill her. - They are on the second floor. - Let's go! Be careful, they're armed. What are you waiting for? Call the ambulance! - Hi. - Hi. What are you doing, miss? Let go of me! Quit holding on to me, miss. Watch out, Sonny! Dad, are you all right? I'm fine. Don't let those transvestites get away. Call yourself a man? Beating up a woman like that. - Yeah! - Shameless! They're men... Make way... move along please. There's nothing to see here. - Move along now, don't obstruct the way. - There's nothing to see here. Go home. Fatty, it's you! - That's my dad. - Get in then. How is my dad, Doctor? He's out of critical condition but still critically injured. So is he still in danger? A bit. There might be complications. - What do you mean? - He means your dad is fine. He said the same thing about Tall Girl after stitching her up. Don't worry, your father is an upright man. He'll be blessed with a long life. - You're right. - Yes. You should believe in fate. He has a long road ahead of him. Let's go. Oh, really? It's an auspicious day? Don't worry. There's no way he's slipping out of it this time. All right. Bye, Mom. Mom says the fifteenth of next month is an auspicious day for our wedding. All right. Here, have some. What's going on? Why are you so nice to me all of a sudden? We've known each other for three years. On closer look, you're really beautiful. Three years? We have been together since I was seventeen. It's been seven years. I can't keep track of so many things. - Do you at least remember my surname? - Of course. - Hi, Tall Girl. - Hi, Fatty. How's your dad doing? He's fine. The doctor said he could be discharged in a week. Wow, you brought me so much stuff. That's too kind of you. I'm always eating over at your place. This is the least I can do. Look, I got you biscuits. And chocolates. Have your assailants been arrested? The two of you really have to watch your backs. We will. Could you come out, Baldy? - I need to talk to you. - Me too. Have a good rest. You can go first. Prince Tak is out to kill us. I can't take this lying down. I'm going to get him once and for all. Hold on to this envelope. Open it if I'm not back in two days. There's $80,000 in there. Take care of my dad for me. Are you kidding? You expect me to take care of your dad for life with just $80,000? You're getting off cheap. Here's an envelope for you too. There's $100,000 in it. Take it and look after Tall Girl for me. - $100,000? - I've been saving up. Yeah, right! We get the same pay. How did you manage to save so much more than me? That's because you spend a lot. Nonsense, it's because I'm always paying for your share. - Tall Girl pays for me. - My dad pays for me too! All right, Fatty. Take it as my fault. Tall Girl isn't married to me yet. She can find herself another man if anything happens to me. Stay here and look after your dad. I'll handle Prince Tak, okay? You better look in on Tall Girl. - It could be your very last glance. - Touchwood! Don't curse me. Hey! Wait for me! - Where shall we go? - Take me home. - Are you kidding? - What do you have in mind then? Those darn scumbags! Fatty! What do you think you're doing? Untie me now! Let me go! - What are you doing? - I'm gonna burn him alive! We're surrounded by explosives. Do you want to die? Baldy! You two are cops! This is illegal! - You better shut the hell up! - Shush. We've resigned. We're crooks now, just like you. What do you want with me? We kidnapped you to extort a confession from you. If you don't cooperate, we'll kill you, dismember your body... - Before fleeing. - Get out of my way! Fatty, no... - Calm down. - Why bother telling him anything? Give him a chance to talk. He might not be behind it. - You're a reasonable man, Baldy. - Confess before he goes postal again. - It's all my brother's doing! - Stop pushing the blame, scum! Heck, don't kick him when I'm right behind! I'll kill him first and go after his brother! Help me, Baldy! He's gonna kill me! - It won't do us any good to kill him. - That's right. - I can give you money. - How much? - $100,000! - $100,000? I mean $100,000 each! Forget it. He's all yours. One million bucks! Holy cow! One million bucks! - A million bucks each! - I don't want your dirty money! - Think it through, Fatty... - Get out of my way! We'll never be able to make that much money! Baldy! He nearly got your girl killed! But she's still alive. My dad nearly died too! But he survived. Baldy, you're such a disappointment! - US dollars or HK dollars? - US dollars! - Baldy! - Save me, Baldy! You better get out of my way! Calm down, Fatty! - It's one million bucks! - Get lost! No! I don't want his money! I want him dead! We won't get a cent if you kill him. It's one million bucks! One million bucks! Darn it! You nearly cut me! Go to hell! Darn you, Fatty! What have you got against money? I'll kill you! Go to hell! Scream louder... Scream louder. Let's go. Baldy... you killed me for money... Oh my gosh... Fatty! - Don't die! I didn't mean to do this. - How... could you... Fatty... This isn't your fault, Baldy. He shouldn't have ran into the crowbar. He deserved it. I didn't mean to do it, Fatty. Don't worry, this is no big deal. Pass me the phone. I'll call my brother to bring you the money. What's the use of money now? I'll be thrown in jail for murder. No, you won't. My brother is a very powerful man. I've killed someone too. But I got away scot-free. My brother will definitely get you out of this mess. Don't worry. Come on. You can trust me. Pass me the phone. Hurry. Come on. You'll be all right! Trust me! That's right. No tricks, I'm warning you. We're surrounded by explosives. Push me too hard and we'll go down together. Don't die, Fatty... Fatty... don't leave me... Hello, Brother? I'm Tak. I've been kidnapped by Fatty and Baldy. They'll only release me for one million US dollars. What? One million US dollars? They're even greedier than me! Baldy killed Fatty. He's turning to us for help. - Are you sure? - I saw it for myself. - His corpse is right in front of me. - I'll bring my men over right now. This place is full of explosives. Don't bring any guns with you. There's no one here but Baldy. And I've got him on our side. - Okay, where are you now? - I don't know. Where are we, Baldy? Hello? We're at Ka Po Chemical Factory... in Ngau Tau Village, Yuen Long. There are explosives everywhere. Come alone with the money. No men and no guns! Fatty, they fell for it! - We're gonna be rich! - All right! - One million bucks! - Darn scumbags! You set me up! I'll make you pay for this! I'll tear you two to shreds! Yes, Boss? Gather some men. We're going to Yuen Long. - Get those two Caucasians to go too. - Are we bringing guns? That's not necessary. We're just dealing with Baldy. We can take him out easily enough. Ho, get one million US dollars from Accounting. Meet me in my car. - Yes, Boss. - Yes, Boss. Make sure you get the clock on your video. We need that for the video to be admissible in court as evidence. All right. You have to act more natural later. Don't be silly! I'm a great actor. I have the flair for being natural. All set up. Baldy, call Inspector Wu now. Hello, Inspector Wu? We've got it all set up. Get ready to make your arrests. What's the location? Hasn't Fatty told you? You numbskull. Hello, Boss? We're at Ngau Tau Village in Yuen... Hello? The phone battery's flat. - Don't you have spare batteries? - No, this is it. Call him from a public phone then. They are here. What do we do? What else can we do? Fight it out! Get into position. Freeze! Don't move! How many of you are there? Three. - Are you armed? - Of course not. Calm down. - Did you call the police? - No. Close the door... Where's my money? Where's my brother? I've hidden him somewhere no one can find him. Come with me. Wait! I'm warning you, no tricks. Or we'll die together! Relax. We're here to help you. Calm down. Stand over there. Stand right there. Don't move. A bit more to your left... a bit to your right. That's right. Why do you want us dead? Don't blame me. You forced me into doing so. Are you behind the murder of Prince Tak's girl and those two cops? Well, you're no better than I. - You killed Fatty. - That's different... He got in your way of making a fortune. Those three I killed were in my way too. - You don't have to worry... - Don't move... - Stand back... - Take it easy... Ho. Here's your money. One million US dollars. Lift it higher. I can't see it. Higher... Are you trying to bribe me? Money is made to be spent. I've arranged for your transport out of Hong Kong. - Do you like the United States? - No. What can I do over there? - What about Thailand? - Same problem. I'm not called Cocaine Wing for nothing. If you're willing to take risks, I can make you rich. I don't think I'm up to taking risks. You're into these things too? - You can have it if like. - No, I couldn't possibly accept it. Work for me, you won't regret it. Fatty! You're still alive! Get the video tape! I'll handle that old fogey. That brawny one's yours. Bingo! Hey, you're pretty good for an old fogey. Bingo... Ouch. - Where is my brother? - He's here. - Where is he? - Over there. - Where is he? - He's here. Over there! And here! My foot! Where am I now? Tak... Shut up, you piece of scum! Fatty! Bingo! He can't possibly dodge this. He dodged it! That old fogey's all yours. I'll go and get help. - Arrest him! - They are his men. Kill them! Come on... Bingo! Bingo! Freeze! Hands up! Help, Fatty! This feller has really strong legs. Learnt your lesson? Whack him on his head. - Am I good or what? - Yeah. Hand my brother over or you won't get out alive! Are you done talking? What do you think, Fatty? I'm fine with it. Get these two scoundrels! - What's wrong? - It's those two scumbags! Not just two. They are all scumbags! Take this. - But I don't know how to use it. - Oh, you're right. Kill them! Bingo! Bingo...! Come on, get me if you... Don't move! Where's my knife? I said, don't move. Return me my knife. No... Don't come any closer... - Prince Tak hit me. - What? Prince Tak? That wasn't Prince Tak. That was me! Keep an eye on the old fogey. I'll go and get Prince Tak. I'm calling the police! Excuse me, are there any warehouses in this area? (In Hokkien) I don't know what you're saying. - I don't understand what you're saying. - Ask someone else! - Bloody fatso! I'm going to sue you! - Move it! Hurry! Oh, you're still alive? Come on, let's go. - Get ready for jail. - I'm going to sue your pants off! - Brother! - He has a gun! Don't move... Don't shoot! Run! Run, Baldy! Hurry! - They are over there! Let's go! - Yes, sir! Forget it. Everything's probably burnt to ashes. Fatty, since you'll be going to Singapore... this pocket watch is my family heirloom. You can have it as a keepsake. - I've never seen it before. - I don't usually take it out. How do I open it? I don't know either. When you're there... finance your own karaoke lounge. Don't rely on any woman. Otherwise you'll be laughed at for being a kept man. We're men. We will not live off women. Take these. - What about you? - I'm staying here. I can't possibly leave Tall Girl behind. I mean how much money did you keep for yourself? What? You don't trust me? It's not just me, no one trusts you. Everyone knows how scheming and greedy you are. Frisk me. You're really doing it? - You're really frisking me? - Turn around. And doing such a thorough job. Darn it. - It's better to do everything properly. - Fine. Okay. - Are you done? - Yeah. - You darn fatso! - Why did you hit me? How could you suspect my good intentions? Go to hell! - I'll strangle you, you scum! - That's enough! I'll kill you! You guys are buddies. Stop fighting! - Get lost! - Get lost!
