I take Oneng, daughter of Bujang Suhendar, as my wife with a set of prayer accessories paid in cash. Witness, do you concur? - Yes. - Other witnesses? - We do! - Ma'am, do you concur? I concur! Praise be to God. Ladies and gentlemen, let us pray for the newlyweds. May they live in peace as a family, and be blessed with love and affection. - Let's hope he doesn't remarry. - Amen. - Lower your body. - Yes. This high? I was told Bajuri drove a fancy car. I was just getting a Bajaj. I'll be there shortly. - Can I get a lift? - No, I just got here. - Take the first one in line. - Okay. MADUN, BAJAJ INHERITED FROM FATHER - Can you take me to Plaza Senayan? - Yes. - Bag snatcher! - Damn. Where is he? Go after him! Come on, hurry! Beat him! Beat him! Show no mercy, Juri! Get him! I can take this guy, easy. Come on, get him! Harder, Jur! Hit him! Come on! Make sure you have the right physique before choosing a profession! You're too fat to be a thief. - Here's your bag. - Thank you. Juri, Ahmad Bajuri. I'm friends with James Bond. - Juri. - What? - Remember your wife. - Stop bothering me. - Miss. - Juri. What? Remember your mother-in-law. It's already noon. We'll continue later. I have to pick up my mother-in-law. Come on, hurry up. Come on! I don't... The thing is I can't drive you there. Is 50,000 enough? Now we're talking. Get me to Gambir as fast as you can. Hold on tight! Sorry. Let's go. Go! I've told you so many times, Oneng. Find yourself a faithful husband! But more importantly, a rich one! Where is Bajuri? Where? Hello? Yeah. Yeah. I'll be there at 12:00. Okay? Peace be upon you. Come on, hurry up! - Have we arrived? - You may get out, sir. Is this Gambir? - You're leaving? - Yes. If you follow the train tracks, you'll reach Gambir. Thank you, miss. It hurts. Oh my God. If I don't deal with these people, mother will beat me. In the name of God. Yogi wants to travel the city. Come on, Gi. Go on, Gi. Sorry, in the name of God. Sorry, I'm in a hurry. Ma'am! Where's my Yogi? - Hey! - Sorry about that! - Where is Juri? - Be patient, mom. Where is Juri? Mom, your groceries. I got everything you asked for. All right, put them there. Where's Juri? Where's your husband? That's Juri, mom. Bajuri! Bajuri, stop. Stop. What a dumb son-in-law. - Mom. - Pick that up. Couldn't you be here on time? Put my groceries in your car. - Which car? - Bajaj! That's a lot, mom. - All of them? - Those are just for me. That's a lot. What on earth? Juri! Why is there a monkey in your car? DON'T KICK US OUT! - Yeah, I'm driving mom. - You're an idiot. You're useless! You even drive a monkey in your Bajaj. You scared me to death. You gave me a heart attack, you idiot! Hurry up and get home. Mom, I know the monkey was in Bajuri's Bajaj, but I'm pretty sure Bajuri had never seen that monkey before. Right? Yes, Neng. - Mom. - What? I'll drop both of you here. I have to go to the court to hear the verdict. Usman's been calling me. Bajuri, mother doesn't want you to drop us here. Get out. Mom, why does Bajuri need to go to court? As far as I know, if he's going to court, he'll be put to Prodeo Hotel. Prison cell. - Mom. - Bajuri! Oneng, we're going to Jakarta. Your father used all of our money to get married again. When you grow up, find yourself a faithful husband. But more importantly, he has to be rich. Like father? You're so dumb. He should have a lot of money so you can live a good life. I'm sorry again! So, Mr. Rohim and Mr. Usman, you're claiming a land in Cilodong that belonged to the late Haji Nasir and was passed down to Ahmad Bajuri? - Correct, sir. - Yes. And Ahmad Bajuri is a nephew of your own? Yes, sir, not anyone else's. He is our nephew. - And you, ma'am? - I'm Bajuri's father's little sister. Bajuri is the rightful owner of the land, sir. He inherited it from his father. That's not true. Your Honor, according to the Criminal Law Article 18, verse... A decision has been made regarding the dispute of a land between Mr. Rohim and Mr. Usman against Mr. Ahmad Bajuri. We have decided... Uncle Usman! Excuse me. Uncle! - What on earth? - Praise be to God. It can't be. - Be patient. - I've been taking care of that land! - Be patient. - I built the fence. I don't care! After a series of investigations, the judge has finally summoned... Sir! - Sir! - We're on the air. We ask the defendant to sit down. Sit down! - Uncle. - Be quiet. The verdict will be announced shortly. Hey, stop. Stop, back up. Keep going back, stop. Stop, we're here. Here we are right in front of the door. - I can go straight in. - A bit too far, ma'am. Take this and stop talking. - Thank you. - Yeah. What is that noise? He's too close! Sir, don't park too close to the other vehicles. If you open the door, you might scratch my husband's Bajaj. Sir, don't forget to move your car. You stupid girl! Juri! Your crimes of terror have claimed many casualties, including lives and properties. The judges have heard enough evidence to convict you of terrorism... Oh God. Terrorism? Hey, sir, you're blocking an officer. All right, go forward. Keep going! They put you in jail for stealing. What about our children? That's why I don't like... Juri! I'm sorry, excuse me. Sorry. - So we have decided... - Juri. Juri. ...to sentence you to death. Neng, I've been sentenced to death. Miss Judge, my husband might have stolen that monkey, but why has he been given a death penalty? - A monkey? - Bajuri! Apologies, ma'am. We were delayed on our way with the defendant. The traffic was terrible, and we had a small problem in the parking lot. It's true, Your Honor. All because of that crappy Bajaj that was parked carelessly, Your Honor. - The defendant... - Later. Sir. Juri! Come here. Sorry, I'm sorry. We're in the midst of the investigation, and we'll update you soon. That's all. Praise be to God, Neng. That inherited land now belongs to us. We'll be rich! Where is the weapon stash located? We'll update you on that too. The investigation is still ongoing. Praise be to God, Juri. Usually when people go on trial, either they get sentenced, or they get a death penalty. I never thought you could be sentenced to be a rich man. - Isn't that right? - Yes. You're always right, darling. Keep laughing. You shouldn't be happy. I won't accept this. I don't care. That land should be mine and Usman's. - Oh, God. - Why is it yours? That's it. No! Uncle, we had an agreement to settle the land in court. Do you think every court is right? No. Listen, this is not over. - I'll make an appeal. - Oh my God. We can give you a lift with our Bajaj. A Bajaj? You fool. - Calm down. - It's okay. It's fine. Don't be afraid, Jur. I've accepted the court's verdict. I'll calm Rohim down. I'll install an air conditioner at his house if needed. - That's right. - He's still hotheaded. All right, thank you. Parti, darling, why did you wash all my clothes? What will I wear now? - Some of them are almost dry. - This one? - Buckets, sir? - No. Soleh, you're showing off with your new bike. Of course. Ili! I could afford a new car Because of you Look at that. Soleh has a new bike. They just sold their new land. That's what people do around here. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you, too. - I'll be the spokesperson. - Yes. Speak on our behalf. - Anyway, who is she? - The community leader's daughter. The community leader! Gentlemen, I'm here to give you all invitations. Praise be to God. What's this invitation for, miss? Well, I'm getting married! - Your fianc√© is quiet. - Yes, miss? Please sing at my wedding. Of course. - Okay. - Of course. - Sure. - We'll get back to handing them out. - Sure. - Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you, too. I can afford a new car Because of you Careful. - Honey, I'm going to the salon. - Okay. - Peace be upon you. - You too. - Peace be upon you, miss. - Peace be upon you, too. What's up, Rit? I'll have a cream bath, as usual. Sure, take a seat. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you, too. Leh, get changed. - They're waiting for you. - Yes! Miss, your invitation. - Thank you, Rit. - Don't miss it! Of course. Rit, you're getting married in two days. If your husband wants to renew his ID card, will he pay too? Rit? Let the rain reach its end Let the river reach its end Let the sea reach its end Bajuri is such a romantic guy. He is, Rit. DEATH OF A DEMONSTRATOR - Do you need help? - I'm fine. Thank you. - Oneng! - Yes, mom? Who is he? This is Bajuri, he wants to drive us home. With what? That. - Where did Bajuri park the car? - It was right here. Damn, where did he go? Ahmad Bajuri. Dark, isn't it? I'm jealous, miss. I hope my relationship is as romantic as yours. - Amen. - Neng, I'm going out. Let the rain reach its end Let the river reach its end Let the sea... What's up? All right, I'm leaving. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you, too. Juri, sorry. I didn't mean to disturb you... - Juri! - Juri, you're rich now. - You're handsome. - Let him go. Juri is leaving. - Balloons! - Enough, later. I was talking to you, where are you going? - Bajuri, where are you going? - Flirtatious. What's wrong, Cup? No, don't. No need to hesitate. Balloons, sir, balloons. - I'll give you a massage. - What's up with you two? How can I say no to Juri? Mister Haji, what time is it? Noon, perhaps. Hey, Oneng! Yes! Rit, wait a second, okay? - Yes, mom? - Look, how can this be? My dress is torn. When will Juri buy me a new one? And a television, a refrigerator and a couch. Bajuri said the money is still in the deposit. It's not melting yet. Why isn't it melting yet? Is he saving money or ice? Huh? Mr. Haji, do you want to go to the bank? These are for you, Bajuri. Please choose. - Any cake? - Yes. Anything for Mr. Bajuri. This one? Take it, yes. - Susi, are you done with the scissors? - I'm done. - Give them to me. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Sus. - What's the matter? - Are you stupid? You're growing eggplants instead of anthurium. I use them when I get bored. This is for you, Leha. Neng, you may have a rich husband, but you should be the one holding the money. Mom, Juri will never take a second wife. I said the same thing to your grandmother after your father sold his paddy field. That's true. One of my relatives sold his field and then married someone else. Be careful. But Juri is different. Besides, he just sold land, not a paddy field. Jur. The three of us could go on a ride. Sure, your husband is indeed different. Hey, give them to me. Juri! What's this? I don't want you to get married again! - What are you talking about? - Oneng. Don't be suspicious if your husband wants to go. Yeah, right. I'm going to go fishing. Fishing? Take care, my son-in-law. Catch a lot of fish. Thank you, mom. I'll bring you some. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you, too, Juri. Let's go. - Is it clean yet? - It is. Here. I had to steal it. He would never give it to me. You're an idiot, Juri. Let me see, mom. THAT'S HOW WE ARE What's this? "House down payment." - Susi. - Praise be to God, mom. Juri bought a house. Do you think it's for you? It's not that good. - Excuse me, sir. - Yeah. Leh, come here. Soleh, come here, quick. Soleh! Whose bag is this? No, it's scary in there. Watch out! - Come on, hurry. - Ili, wait. You're too slow. - Did you find the worms? - We did. Good, put them down here. Okay. - Here's your meal, Juri. - You took your time. I had to find some small change first. The change. You still love small change. You said you were rich. People who sell their lands usually buy a new car or a house. Or... Or what? Take a second wife. - Hey, are you finished with the worms? - Yes. - All right. - But if you ever got married again, and Oneng couldn't accept that, and then, for instance, Oneng's mom and Parti agreed... Do you think it would be possible? - What? - Taking Oneng as my second wife. You're dreaming. Hello? Yes, uncle? No, I remember. I'm going to the bank to get the money. Yes, uncle. - Who was that? - Uncle Usman. I want to make the full payment of the house. You're buying a new house? You know, Cup, it's been a year since Oneng and I got married, but we still live with her mom. This is the time for me, Cup, to prove that I can make Oneng happy. Ili! Are you teaching Soleh how to drink beer? It's only for fishing. Come here. Fishing? Do you think fish will get drunk by pouring this? Wait a second, watch this. I've got a lighter. Let me show you. It looks like a bomb. That's because it is. Quick! - Why me? - Cup! - Nothing happened. - I don't know. - That's enough. You better go, guys. - Aren't you going to fish? No, I have some unfinished business. Take these. Hey! Damn you! Where did you find that? At the spooky house, when we were looking for worms. Did you know it's dangerous? Don't play with it. - Yes. - You could get arrested. - Yes. - You could die. I know. Yogi! Stop. We're getting out. Oh! Wait a minute. Here's some money for you to get home. - Okay. - Go home, don't make any stops. - Yes. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Wait, give the bag to Ucup. All right, go. - Peace be upon you. - You too. Hey, don't park here. Park? Hey, eggplant. You don't know who you're talking to. - This is my boss, Mr. Ahmad Bajuri. - A mister riding a Bajaj? He doesn't know you yet. Show him. No need, Cup. No need. We can't be like that. Listen to me, we can't be so arrogant. We can't just tell people that we have half a billion rupiahs! Eat that! Half a billion rupiahs! If your family used this in a public toilet, they would bleed. - Do you understand? - Can you see it properly? Then get the hell out of the way. We're going in. Degrading. Weird. Is it automatic or manual? - Cup. - Hang on. Just a second, miss. You are late. I want to withdraw my money. You need two more zeros to withdraw 500 million. Miss, no need to say it out loud. Yes, sorry. Sorry. Five hundred million. Hello. I'm only withdrawing 500,000 to pay an electricity bill. And a water bill. They're overdue. - Bambang? - Dimas? - Come here. Did she call you too? - Yes. Thank God. - Do you know the mission? - I do. Now let's get changed. All right? Not like this, Bambang. This is too conspicuous. You look like Rambo. Peace be upon you, Mr. Haji. - Peace be upon you, too. - May I help you? There's no need. I'm waiting for a friend. Okay then, Mr. Haji. Thank you. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you, too. Oh, my God. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you, too. Mr. Haji, did you see my friend? - Your friend? - Yes. What does he look like? Like you, but he doesn't have a mustache or a beard. Ouch! Why are you dressed like a haji, Bambang? You can't even perform ablution. If we dress up like this, I can't recognize you. - Let's wear some cool clothes, okay? - Sounds good. Number 13. - Excuse me, sir, this is your money. - Thank you. - Hold on, there's still more. - More? Do you have a plastic bag? Five hundred thousand is a lot. Effort "F" means faith Stop! - Ucup, Ucup! - One second. Give them back. Put them back. Thank you. What's wrong with you? Apologies, sir, ma'am. Take this. I'm sorry. Yep. There must be an amulet inside. The owner can't have 500 million. I can't believe Flintstones' cars still exist. Hey, did you wash my Bajaj? - How would I wash this ugly Bajaj? - Cup? Ugly? Why are there scratches on it? - They were already there. - No. Why is there an "L" here? - What was it before? - It was an Arabic letter. You're embarrassing me. Do you think it's the Koran? He's stubborn. Don't be arrogant. You want to see this? - Check this out. - Okay. - Okay. - Rich man on the road. - Give me a wad of cash. - A wad? Do you think it's a banana? Let's say it's a parking fee. - Let me push. - Don't touch it. Let's go, Cup. - Let's go. - Let's go. - Bambang. - Yes, Mas? - Is this all you've got? - Why? It's hard to turn, Bambang. Yeah, I forgot. Man, let me borrow your car. NO SMOKING AREA LOVE PEOPLE AROUND YOU Don't give up, yes! Yes, let's go. - Move out of the way! - Watch out! Those guys are following us! They could be robbers! Hold on tight! - I changed my mind, it's too expensive. - What? It's hard for me to lift this. Put this down. Never mind. - Ucup! - Bajuri! - Oh no. - What happened? - What's the matter with you? - I'm sorry, ma'am. - What are you apologizing for? - Don't drive so fast. I fell off. I told you to hold on tight, but you had this big headset on. They couldn't possibly be robbers. There they are. Cup, run! Go, Cup, go forward! Why are you speeding down the street? You're making too much noise! We can't make a turn, Bambang! Lift it up. - Lift what? - Air Force. Lift the bike. - There! Make a turn! - I can't, Bambang. - We should take it apart. - The Vespa? - No, the wall. - You're too slow! Just get on. RICE STALL Cup, looks like they're gone. Let's go. Cup? What? Hey! Why are you eating? You said you were pretending. It's rice and fried eggs. - Sir. - Yes. The usual. Three portions, takeaway. - They're gone, let's go. - What about the food? - Give it to that old hag. - What did you say? Damn, I came here to buy food. I'm not a beggar. - She's a customer, Cup. - What a coincidence. Look what you got after catching that snatcher, an inheritance! You're being rewarded for your good deeds. - You should buy me lunch! - Amen, sure. - Sir, give me something to eat. - Okay. Yes. Quick! Hey, pay up! - You can't run! - They're still there. They're still there. - Sir, where's my rice? - I took it away. I thought you were done. Sir, one more. Double portions. Hey, double portions? Pay me first. Don't eat too much. You'll get fat. - Why are we spying on them? - So they can't see us, Bambang. - Pay up with your money. - I don't have any money right now. You've got a lot of cash. I'm hiding the cash in here, Cup. I can't take it out. I'll do it. - Really? - Yes. Let's go. - Quick. - Here's your rice. - Take some out for Sanif as well. - Thank you. Yes. You two are really something! This is a food stall! Don't get intimate here. Go find another place. - You two are really something. - Okay, okay. Yes, uncle Usman? Tell him to wait. Tell the owner to wait. Let's go. Help! Help! Help! Help me! Sir! She's asking for help. Help! - Sir. - What's wrong? Help me, please, sir. I just got robbed. Take me to the police station, please. - We'll take you there, get in. - Take me to the police station, please. - Get in. - Calm down. We'll drive you there. What are you doing? - Keeping her company. - No, you drive. I'll go in the back. Hop in the front. Calm down. Hurry up, Cup! Help me! Hurry up! - Get in, Cup. Shift the gear up. - Come on. You said there was a police station here. Where is it? Ouch! Where's the money? Dimas! Bambang! Tie them up. Good evening, Dan. We found a bag with a bomb inside. Where's the bag? Sir, help me. Don't move. I think this is a high explosive. Don't move. Lower your hand. Whose bag is this? The owner of that Bajaj. Your hand. Sorry, sir, this is it. Ahmad Bajuri. Okay. We'll check this at the office. Let's go. Sir, what about this? - Call Gegana, deal with this. - Roger that, sir. Call Gegana, the SWAT, the FBI, the CIA, The A Team. Call all of them, sir. You're running out of phone credits to make this phone call. Out of phone credits. How are you running out of phone credits? Use a telegram to make it quick, sir. Allah is great, Allah is great I lost my money, Cup. I lost my chance too, Cup. To show my mother-in-law... that I'm a good husband. A husband who can make his wife happy. This is all your fault, Cup! Unbelievable. He blamed me again. Again and again. But you were the one who wanted to be with that girl. Who asked to sit in the back and keep her company? I can't ignore people in need. I've got to help! - I wanted to help. - Same here. I wanted to help too. - I even wanted to marry her. - What? Hey, roaches, give me back my rice! Quick! You're so dirty minded! Give it back! What's this? It's not mine. Give me my rice back! Quick! Her rice is already gone. It's okay. We'll change that with 100 thousand. - Hey, ugly old hag. - What? Help us first, and then we'll give you the rice. Who did he buy the house for? Why don't you believe me? He just asked me to look for one. I don't know who the house is for. - Here you go, uncle. - Yes, Leh. - Yes. - Leh, Leh. Give me a massage first. A boy named Soleh should be a good masseur. If Juri decides to take a second wife, I'll shave that woman bald. - Cup, tomorrow, okay? - That's him. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you, too. - Uncle Usman. - Leh, put it inside. - Jur, why didn't you show up? - Why did you come here? - Did you bring the money? - Of course, calm down. - What happened with the money? - What's up with you? If I were to carry 500 million, everybody would notice. - Maybe you're hiding it. - Okay. - Don't you forget. - Yes. - Don't forget. - Yes. - Ma'am, I'm leaving. - Okay. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you, too. - Take care! - Yes. It's hot. I'll take a shower. Who's in there? Oneng, one moment. Neng, be quick. - What's wrong, can't hold it anymore? - Cup! Cup, throw it in! - Honey... - Cup! If you wanted to buy a house, why didn't you talk to me about it? Neng, if I talk to you, then you'll talk to your mom. Everything would be ruined. One second. I need to do something. Be quiet. Cup! Hurry up! Cup! What's taking you so long? Where's the bag? Throw it in! - The bag he threw in? - He threw it in already? - He did. - Where is it? I threw it outside. I can't believe people throw their trash into our bathroom. - Oh boy. - Honey? Oh, my wife! Praise be to God! Lucky it's here. One, two, three, four... Bajuri! Go away! An owl that only comes out at night. I don't want to. I don't want to wash my hair again. - Which house is it? - That one. - Stay here. - Okay. Hey, who are you? Is that your new wife? Syaiful Jamil, sir. Hey, robber! Thief! Where's the robber? Hey! Thief! - Hey, robber! - Robber! Hey, thief! Are you trying to rob me? Don't you dare! Come back! I'll beat you up! Mom? Were you chasing a robber? Don't touch it. There could be fingerprints. Looks like they were... - Mom. - ...the same robbers from the bank. - Here are the clothes. - Oneng, give me a cream bath, please. Yes. Just a second, Sus. If the robbers came in through the window, why is there a hole in your ceiling? It was an insider, sir, a usual robber. We should call the cops. Okay, yes. Hello? Bajuri has just left. Yes, he's not here. What? What? A television, a refrigerator and a new bed ordered by Mr. Bajuri will be delivered now? Oh, of course, sir. Mom, Bajuri bought a new television, a refrigerator and a new bed. Yes. Hello? No, sir. This is not Asem Street 3 No. 10. No, sir. His wife's name is not Yuli, but Oneng. That's me. Another wife? Mom, I know that address. Ili, I'm so scared. This must be the terrorist's place. I'm scared. I want to go home! There's a noise inside. Be quiet! Wait. Slowly. Monkey! You panicked! You held onto me really tight! Is everything here? Is it safe? Hiya. What's that? You. I'm not going to let anyone hurt my daughter. - I agree. This is the house. - This one? - I'm going to kick her ass. - As a woman, I'm hurt too. Let's go. I'll beat her. I'm going to punch her. Yuli! I'll get you! Yuli, get out! You married my daughter's husband. I'll kill you! It's dark for you all. Get off me! It's raining, honey. Let the rain have its season Let the rain have its end Let the sea have its shore No matter what came before Or what comes in the future Our love will never reach its shore Our love will never reach its limit Our love will never stop Why did you open it like that? - How should I do it? - Like this, use your hands. First, you press it. Then, you spit it out like this. Try it! How did you do that? Again! Darling! Open it, Cup. Yes. Put it there. - Slowly. - It might be stuck, Cup. - Oneng. - Don't ever lie to me again. What are you talking about? You bought a new television, a refrigerator and a bed, right? For Yuli, your new wife. I don't want you to take a second wife. I don't want you to take a second wife. I don't want that. You were with me when you were poor. Now that you have money, you want to ditch me. - Yeah, why? - Are you a conglomerate? Are you a celebrity? Are you someone important? You don't need to follow their footsteps. You don't need to have more than one wife. Yes. Neng, someone says you were kidnapped. You're saying that because you want to get married again. Neng, the guy on the phone says you were kidnapped. Here. Oh my God. What should I do, darling? I've been kidnapped? Oh, no. - What about it? I've been kidnapped. - Oneng. Neng, you're still here. Right? Yes. Juri, help me! - Susi? - Did you eat a Dutch eggplant? That's funny, Cup. Juri! Mom? Mom, what are you doing there? Oh boy. Who are you? I'm an eggplant grower from Tasikmalaya. Rotten! Kidnap Bajuri's wife, Dimas, not an eggplant grower. Bajuri's wife, what's your name again? Alfred. - Bambang! Don't laugh! - Yes, sorry. Bajuri's wife, Bambang! Not an eggplant grower! What did I say, Bambang? - My mother. - Be strong, Oneng. Be patient, Neng. Darling, find mother! Neng, that's your mother's trick. Jur. I had a friend who thought the same thing as you. He thought his mother-in-law's kidnapping was only a trick. - So his mother-in-law could have money. - Listen to him. Not long after that, they sent the wedding ring as proof so people would believe them. He had to pay the ransom and be obedient. - He identified her from the ring? - Yes, he could see it. He could tell from the wart on the finger that came with the ring. You made everyone panic, Jang. Why does everyone here like to make everyone panic? This is how people are here. Why are you still accusing mom of setting you up? Neng, even if it were true, your mom doesn't have a wart on her finger. Right? So it's safe, right? Yes. What does that mean? Emak's children should try to find their kidnapped mother! - Kidnapped. - I'm sorry. I have a suggestion. I think... - Yes. - Apologies beforehand. Yes. Her children should look for her. - That's stupid. - Money. Darling, find mom! - Find her! - Neng! As long as I can remember, she wasn't wearing a ring. She was just wearing a hijab. Yes, she was wearing a hijab. Then, they will send Emak's hijab, along with her head. Darling, pay the ransom! Oneng, calm down. Thank you, Cup. Jur, what if we go to the police? I'll look for mom! I'll go to the police. Keep walking. Now sit. ...wearing leggings. So the name of the victim who was kidnapped is Mrs. Eti, daughter of Somad? - Yes, sir. - And Mrs. Susi? His full name is Susilo Supriatna. Oh, he's a man? Yes. Why did you report this just now? Because my husband doesn't believe me. He said my mother set him up. That's because she wants my money, Neng. She even tried to fish it from the attic. Because you want to use it to take a second wife. No, Oneng! Your mother made that up! My mother wouldn't do something like that! Good evening, Commander. Dan, issue the arrest warrant by tonight. Who's the Commander? You or me? If I'm the commander, then what are you? - Subordinate, Commander. - What should I type? Roger that, Commander. - What case? - Your mother is a gold digger! The terrorist's case. - You love money more than mom! - Suspect's name? Your mom loves money more than me. If you were the abductee, mom would pay your ransom. Ahmad Bajuri, sir. - Impossible! - My mother would never do that! Ahmad Bajuri? What case, sir? A terrorism case, Giga Bank's bombing. Commander, excuse me. I'm going to prepare the team. - Go ahead. - Yes, sir. One second, sometimes my men make mistakes. Yes, sir. - Cup. - What's the matter with you? Come with me. I want to see mom! - Let's go. - Sit down. - Sit, face that direction. - Cup! Can you repeat it? - The name of the suspect? - Ivan Barbie, sir. Oh my God! Darling, let's look for mom! That's what we're doing now! But where are we going? Just be patient. We're driving now. Hey, Cup, drive safely! - The engine broke, Jur. - The engine broke? Didn't you service the Bajaj with the cash I gave you? Remember the money you gave me? I bought a football shirt with it. All right, stop. You don't care about my mom. - You don't want to pay the ransom. - Neng! I told you to report it to the police, but you ran away. Do you want them to take me to Nusa Kambangan? - Neng! - Bajuri, the cops! - The cops! - Run, Cup! - Sus. - What, ma'am? Come closer. Why? Get the scissors out of my back pocket. - Got them? - Yes. Cut this, you got it? Yeah, I got this. - Cut it. - Cut it, cut it. - I'm free. - Ma'am, wait for me. Will he wake up if I kiss him? Cup, you... Just... Stop shaking, Cup. - I'm scared. - So am I. They're getting close. - I'm dead. - They're here, Cup. Hey! What are you doing here? Are you still looking for more? It's the old hag again. I thought you were the police. This is my husband's Metro Mini. Don't have sex here. Bad luck. - Sex? - Sex? Get out! - This Metro Mini stinks. - You always show up, like a mosquito. Thank God. You officers are willing to take me to free my mom. But why aren't you guys wearing your police uniforms? We're undercover cops. Right, Cap? Yes. Oh, okay. - Bring her here. - Slow down, officer. Where's my mother? Bambang! Yeah? I told you to guard them. Why are you sleeping? Bambang! - Hey, tie her up! - Mom, this is Oneng! - She's not here. - Why do you keep slapping me? Make sure she can't run! Mom! Bajuri! Cup. Is that old hag gone yet? She is, there's nobody here. - Hello? - Bajuri! Neng, Oneng! - Hello? Oneng, hello! - Bajuri! Hello? We have to save Oneng. We can save Oneng later. We have to save the Bajaj first. Cup, is the Bajaj getting towed by the police? - Who else, the Boy Scouts? - Where are they taking it? Religious Affairs. How will we get home? How do you think? By foot. Don't move! Good evening. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. - Good evening. Good evening. - Good evening, good... - Get in! Hop on, Cup. Go. Don't move, Cup. Oh my God, Cup. Juri, stop. What's wrong? That's your Bajaj. What? Take a look inside. Is that Madun? Yes, it is. Why is it here? Chicken satay! This could be a police set-up, Cup. - What should we do, Juri? - Chicken satay! It's all quiet. Cup, I'm going home. Find out if there are cops around. - Alone? - Who do you want to go with? Okay. Parti, open the door, honey. Why did you come home? It's late. Did you just get home? Don't come home at all. - I just got home and you're already angry. - Don't come in. Leave. Why not? I'm your husband. Open the door. Let me in. As my husband, you should care more about me. I was home alone, cleaning everything by myself. Why? That's easy. I'll help you clean. And the laundry. I'd even wash your underwear. Now, open the door. - Really? - Yes. - All right. Come in. - That's my baby. Freeze. Ti, why didn't you say something? I told you not to come in. Just go. Excuse me, sir. This is my husband, don't shoot him. If you shoot him, I won't have anyone else. Yes, sir. No one will help her clean. - Sorry, sir. - Yes. We're doing a recon of Ahmad Bajuri's house. Do you know him? I don't know Ahmad Bajuri, no. What about the person on the left? Do you recognize him? The one in a Manchester United shirt. No, sir, I don't know him. Honey, get me a new shirt. It already smells. - Why now? - Just do it. I want to get dressed. Which one? This one? I don't like Manchester United! I'm a fan of Manchester United! - Why are you running? - We're screwed. The cops have surrounded your home. Really? We have to get that money. Whatever it takes. I have to prove that I can save Oneng. Hey, what if you get shot? I'm not afraid, Cup. I'm scared, sir, don't shoot! Don't take me to Nusa Kambangan! Have mercy! Why would he take you to Nusa Kambangan? It's just a guy selling sekoteng. Excuse me, hot sekoteng? Your farts are warm. Yes, sir, as warm as love. Two, yes? Sekoteng! Sekoteng, sekoteng! Sekoteng, sekoteng! - Shoot, Ili, shoot. - Hold. - Excuse me, do you want sekoteng? - No. Shoot! Here are your sekoteng drinks. Oh my God! Bajuri? Hey, where did you find this? I found it at the spooky house. It happens to be a terrorist den! Don't you know that we are surrounded by the police? What a coincidence. We want to report this to the police. Don't. What are you thinking? We can report it later. They'll think we are the terrorists. Right. Don't play with this anymore, okay? Yes. My God, what is this? Hey, throw these away. Okay. Yes. Sekoteng. Freeze. Follow me. Where is he going? Damn it, my sekoteng drinks. That's the wrong shirt. This could be it. Peace be upon you. Kids, hey. Did you see a guy carrying my sekoteng drinks? No, we didn't. Same here. I can't see a thing. He took my glasses. Commander, the target has turned the lights off. - Why is it dead, Ili? - Don't worry, I'll find it. - We're going in. - Roger that. Hold on. - Are you... - I'm not... Freeze, don't move! - Sir... - Shut up. Cup, Cup. Don't start it, just push it. Push? - Ma'am. - Hey. Sus. Push my ass. Sir, go. Sir, give us a ride, please. Your fat face scared him away! - I was asking for help! - "Sir, help me." - No. - Where are you going? I'm driving. Cup, what's the matter with you? You hit someone. Help them, Cup. Juri! You idiot. Mom, why are you here? You didn't pay my ransom! Hang on right there, mom. What did you want the money for? To get married? No, mom. I'm using it to save Oneng! - What happened to her? - She was kidnapped. The kidnappers who took you were actually after Oneng. I'm going to help Oneng! Move. - Move. - Quick! Quick! You hit me. Hey! Sir... They left Susi. Go. We have to help Oneng. Let's go, Juri. Hurry up, Juri. - Peace be upon you. - Mom! Oneng. We've brought the money. Where is Oneng? - Bajuri! - Oneng! - Where's Oneng? - Come here. - Oneng is first. - Come here. How dare you defy me. - Dimas! Come out! - Mom! - Oneng! - Neng. - Neng, come here. - Oneng. - Neng, Neng. - Mom! Praise be to God, Oneng. My daughter. Praise be to God, Oneng. She's still mad at you. - Are you hurt? - No. Not a scratch? Let's take her home. Hey! - Wait! - We brought all the money, right? - What else? - Listen to me. - Are you thirsty? - No. - Are you? - No, I said no. Are you thirsty? - You know I am. - Drink this. No, no. Don't do anything stupid. - Don't report us to the police. - I won't. - You got me? - Yes. - What kind of drink smokes? - Don't ask! - I'm scared. - Come on, hurry up. - I'm scared. - I'm terrified. Juri, be quick. Hey, you idiot. Go away! Faster, Jur. - Faster! - Push. - It's working! - We got it! Money. Money. Hold this. Why is this tempeh? Look! - Is this money or tempeh? - Both. Find the money! - Go! - Yes. Ladies and gentlemen... Next, we're going to sing a song called "The not-so-serious song!" That's the title. One, two, three, four. Chief, the groom is here. Stop it! Sir! Which one is the groom? Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you, too. Hey, man, having sekoteng at the Friday Market. Don't forget to make a stop in Keramat Jati. I've come to pay my respects. Please accept us with pleasure. Not yet! What's going on? We didn't bring money for the wedding. Calm down! Follow me. Ma'am! - My God! - I see. Hey, man. Juri, what happened to the house? What a nice house! The decorations are by the police! I must find Soleh and Sahili. They are the witnesses! Annoying. Our target is here. - Then what are you doing here? - Waiting. Go get him. - We get slapped no matter what. - Let's go. - Mom, mom. - Mom, what? The bad guys are here! Grasshopper butterfly. We'll duel! Not yet! What's up, ladies and gentlemen? - Not yet. - Oh, my God. Mrs. Minah, where are Sahili and Soleh? Sorry. I don't know. Chief! Where are Sahili and Soleh? Don't mind him. What are you doing, Bajuri? - What? - Jur, the bad guys! It's busy down there.

Neng, let's pretend we're getting married Neng, let's pretend... Reporting, Commander. The missing Bajaj has returned to its original position. What about my monkey? You could get arrested, too. - Monkeys are now forbidden in Jakarta. - Yes, sir. Neither the song nor the title is serious It's just a game Very nice. Neng, let's pretend... Neng, let's play a dancing game - Hey, why are you stealing? - I'm not trying to steal anything! Who said you're a thief? Damn you! Do you think I'm a prostitute?

Don't just stand there, darling. You could get shot. Move aside, darling! Where's the money? You two are working together? You're faking the robbery. Juri, you're such an asshole.

I swear, Neng, I don't want a second wife. I don't believe you. It's true, Neng. My love is just for you. How could you say "love"? You even forgot our love vows! Hey, this is not marriage counseling. I'm pointing a gun at him! I hate you, Bajuri. Four...

Live our lives together... Five... Doesn't this gun command any respect? We'll die together. The money is inside that bag. - There. - Don't trick me. If it's not there, I'll shoot you.

Darling? - Juri. - Praise be to God, Ucup. He's alive, Ucup. Don't worry, Jur. The real terrorists have been arrested. I'm the one who shot Uncle Usman, aren't I smart? How did you do it? Oneng is confused too. I wanted to shoot his head, but I shot his leg instead. Mr. Bajuri, you have a great wife. She shot a guy using a blank pistol. - Neng. - You're awesome, Oneng. - Oneng. - Yes! - Neng. - Yes, darling? - Let's go back. - Let the rain reach its end! - Let the river... - You don't have to repeat it.
