- Harriet, I told you to get dressed. - Do I have to follow? I have a history test ... You're not ashamed. It's my bedroom, not arena. Have you bought a new one? Why are you dressing up? It's just breakfast. No, we're gonna have breakfast out. - Before I drive, at least? - So low cut it wasn't in the picture. - The model had some tits. - Thanks. See if Harriet is ready. - Spoiler, she's in the end. - Claire, don't be mean. - Where's Dad? - Yes, where can he be? Richard, up with you. How late were you left in the office last night? It doesn't sound like a lawyer, though writing does not give paid per hour. It can take a whole day to form a sentence. Do you write a book or chop a tombstone? You promised to come along. - We'll have breakfast. - We'll have breakfast outside. - You could support me. - How? After all, you're gone every night. Why are you so excited? You write a book about finding its inner peace. - I just want to sleep. - I have gags. Okay, you're driving. And he doesn't sleep, he'll follow along. - What are they doing here? - They're going. If I say "get a room" you will take my room again. Caroline, we got such a good idea. - Why are you wearing nine uniforms? - We're going to work after. - No, Alex! No character! - Yes. 8 words, the first word. How do you get the first word? I do everything as a long thing. No, I've seen your characters. We will be late in reality. - We're getting married. - I couldn't do the the whole package. The garden is so big and nice. We have lanterns and light trails. You know what it's like to be young and drive. - Married in my bathtub, if you wish. - The best sister ever. - Can we go now? - So, where? - Shall we go out? - Doesn't anyone read my SMS? Yes, we do. We like them. - Caroline, I just want to lie down. -Why do you have to go out promptly? For normal families go out and have a nice breakfast. Now we are normal. What are you wearing? Oh well, that's fine. - Hi, Joshua. - Honey! Where have you been? - I've been trying to reach you for 20 hours. - I've been on a plane. Where are you, at the International Space Station? Mom, Joshua wants to talk to you. - Wait. - You should try the dress now. - You get your movie. She wants a break. - She has just been on vacation. Are you in Australia now? Look at Honey's contract, You should ask me about everything. Australia! - Check out her Twitter flow. - Twitter? I'm not twelve years old. You learn to take care of yourself. We'll be home for a couple of days. - Honey! Hey! Welcome home! - I'm fine, Doug. Shit, thank you. Well, honey, darling. God, that's good. If you need a photographer ... What are you looking? That's why I'm the right man. Perfect. Don't touch me. Rhonda Birchmore! You look hungry, did you sleep on the plane? Maybe we should have been waiting a little. That's how you must look. I'll spray on your face. - Stop, what's up with you? - You don't know how you look, like now? You behave strangely. Why you were hiding in the tax booth? You shouldn't see I brought a gift for you. It's a charm for my little kangaroo. - I don't want to be photographed now. - What are we doing? One million hits in a day. We wrote something about being in Australia. They love it. - Should we have breakfast now? - I want my bag. How difficult is it to find your suitcase? Caroline, my bag ended up on another plane. Incredible, huh? God, how old you should be. Claire and Harriet. Haven't you grown since? - What did you do to the guy? - I've cut myself. Hi, Richard. - Where's Katie? - She ... Talking with Aunt Beth. Katie! - Alex, don't let her leave. - Come on. - No, I'm getting in, again. - How can you do that? - The family? What a monster. - Katie, she's sorry for that. - Is she here to apologize? Yes. No, not really. They're going to release Honeys pop right here. It's time to spend time with us. It was important for her to be with you. - It's good. - Good? Who are you? - Isn't it time to move on? - Go on? Who are you calling? Do you have her book in your phone? How can you read it? You don't read by leaves, but by paragraphs. "I'm annoyed with Honey's diet after seeing my sister Katie "- - "Fight with her overweight." - Why did she wrote so? It's a lie. - Me and you, we know it. - No one else knows so. - Honey, it's clear they know. Sorry, sir. Is she thick? Do you think my feast looks thick? You don't have any relation on that. You don't look, you just say no. Lilla Katie! It must be Alex. Welcome to the family. Look at you, Katie! You're a real woman now. - She will say immediately I'm thick. - Well, I didn't say that. - Huh? What do you think ... - Due to Chapters 3, 5, 8 and 11. That was the proposal, they want you to take it out and swing. It was a huge mistake. - That was the proposal, it was a mistake. - I was here when she said it! I'm really sorry. Please, don't. Where's my little niece? Thanks. - Yes, Roy! Look, what a body. Show it off! Do it! Do it! Do it! God! Mindi and Sian! They're here! - Is she American? - They've been living in Los Angeles for 6 years. Katie! Caroline! - Which one is you? - Katie, the one with the noise. I have a forgiveness problem. - Hi, Uncle Richard! - Hi, honey. Nice to see you. It can't be Harriet. Mother! She's wearing her "monkey girl suit"! Hey, Indian girl. Awesome t-shirt. - We have to go shopping. - Sure. Shut up! Is it Alex? God, Katie! What is he! - Thanks. - Two veterinarians in the same family. - What a cute outfit. - Nice, do you think? The embroidered puppy was my idea. - Honey, who are they ... - My stylist and assistant. Doug is my bodyguard. Roy, get out from the pool! - Why did you lace up? - It looks cruel. Or Katie? I must be blond in the video. I'm gonna dropped as single. Not a "monkey girl" single, a real one. We recorded a video in Mexico. - Come on, Diane. - We have to start. The room is perfect. - My assistant was a replacement. - Yeah, it's perfect. - Beautiful! Look, Caroline. - Oh! The curtain looks nice. We're putting it up in "YouTube". Everyone has to like it. - The light disappeared. - We take family pictures. - The family portrait, I mean. - What family portrait? - Honey wants to write about the vacation here. - Katie should change. No, you look so ordinary wonderful. - Honey, come here! - Richard, hug Caroline. - We take it after breakfast, we are starving. - I can't have breakfast now. - You asked me to bring everyone here. Caroline, Diane said the light out is ideal now, we don't have time for breakfast. Don't pose, please. Grazing is like a normal family. Talk, be happy. Enjoy the company. - Fuck, Alex! - Yeah, that was fun. - Sorry, they found your suitcase. - Sure. After that we go down. - Leave it in my room. - It's not there. Police. - It was hard for everyone to get here. - Can you identify your luggage? - My daughter has a photo shoot. - We don't need to talk to her. - I'll take it later. 5 o'clock? - We want you to come now. Certainly. I will fix it. Mindi, Sian! This is my new little sister. From ... - Beth, where are you going? - Never mind. I'll go jogging. - Caroline? - Beth? Stop, Miss Halloway! - Okay, now life is in a gap. - It's from TV, after all. Unbelievable. Isn't it incredible? Stay! Calm down, Miss Halloway. Diane, do the photo shoot. - Caroline, take her to Honey. We are not in that mood. The Rolling Stones taught me. - Diane! - Miss Halloway, join us. I want Diane to come back. You know what? I understand you are stressed- - but I'm also stressed. 30 seconds ago the mussels have been removed. I couldn't help you before and now the gas is running out. Miss Halloway, you've never been arrested for illegal drug smuggling. It's just a pain relief. It hurts if you fix your eyes. - 500 OxyContin tablets? - I didn't want to end with them. My goodness, Beth. You don't have to fix it. Says someone who looks like someone has pressed a fork on his face. - Know Honey? - Mindi said you go shopping. - How nice. Get me there. - Was your lawyer? - Can't you represent me? - I'm a corporate lawyer. Would you like to buy a deal? - I have no lawyer. - Who did you call with your phone? I will take care of it. - The ladies. A photographer. Are you unsatisfied with the switch images? - Diane stay, I have his card. - Beth, there will be no photo shoot. How should I launch Honey's single ones? - You've been arrested. - We pay the bow sum money. You run the risk of escaping. You risked people's lives. - Think the chef didn't sign you up. - Which chef? The one you almost set on fire. Fried. That was not the point. You can't keep me here. We are not. Your sister insisted, us to sign up you for detoxification. I don't need to be detoxed. I've just managed. Eight months ago. Honey, ...? What's going on with her? - Caroline? - She can stay in our dining room. - That's where Richard sleeps. No. Sometimes. He works late and doesn't want to wake me up. The guest room is in the front door. - Andy, the car's here. - Okay. You follow us. - No. Caroline, help me. - I promise to take care of her, honey. Do the photo shoot. What should she do? go after "Monkey girl 4"? - Anyone else? - She's ashamed! - After that, she gets old. - She's sixteen! Sex sells for her age, not monkeys. She's not going to have a relief. She needs a new career now. - Promise to take her to the place. - My God, okay I'll do it. But don't tell the movie company. They just care about their film series. I could have beaten her. She was high on pain. Charles, that's me. Can you do a research for the drug laws? What a fucking word. I'll do it. - Is that Roger? Are you at work? - Singapore greens will do on Monday. - What time is it? - Why are you talking on the phone? - It's Caroline. - Where is she? Make sure my uterus has cracked. She hates women's things. She has broken the womb. Are you very hurt? Make sure I'll leave for Singapore on Monday. I have also something else to arrange. God, shall we go home with you? How fucking cruel is that? - I'll tell you at home. - Sorry, for the damage in the kitchen ... - Awesome, Sebastian? - Seb. - Today's day? - Chief. Three clams? I'm Beth Halloway's sister ... Lawyer. - I'm not filing. - So generous. - People have threatened me with fire before. - I missed that in the TV show. - Then we discussed for the damage. - What damage? She wanted a lot. A big package flies away ... Caroline, there's no danger. If you change your mind, then I'll work two blocks away in the big, shiny house. I have no card, would you put my number on the phone? - I can take yours, otherwise. - I'm flattered, but no thanks. - Why are you flattered? - I understand. You probably don't. My sister got a breakdown, we were with the police. And you think I'm here to invite you? You mentioned the TV show. Many women want my number. Jsses. Thanks for not reporting. You should add a clam. Claire, mom wrote that she is in trouble. Make sure I'll be in the office. - Why has she said that she should be here? - Because she's your mother. Make sure Harriet takes Honey to sleep at hers. What are you doing inside? Nothing. Oh my God. Oh my God! - Isn't it difficult for an altar? - Your hair looks awesome! - I love Ryan. - As far "monkey girl" is concerned? Your purple button skull. - Caroline, we drink margaritas. - Yes, Caroline. We do. Did dad said that you had cut yourself? - Why did Ryan and you end up? - Ryan's a boy. Sit next to me, Alex. - I need a real man. It was he who operated your breasts? She has implants. - Shit. Come on, Alex. - No one knows anyone. - I didn't think about anything. - What? Honey, Caroline has something to say. God, I love the hair cakes. Honey ... Your mother ... Beth ... Your mother ... Ended up in trouble today. - Did she get stuck in the business again? - She didn't go shopping. She has gone to a detox clinic. - Who does she know? - Honey, Beth is addicted. Is that a shame? - She's addicted to pain relief. - No, she's not. I'm sorry. She was arrested today. Have I been kidnapped? Do they know that they are my relatives? - They are, old man. - They justify you. No offense. Mom is not addicted to anything. Why she didn't answer to the phone? - You're safe here with us. - What "belongs to you"? I showed you your song. Can I have an Alvedon? I have a headache after the trip. - No medicine, Miss Halloway. - No, only 5-6 headache tablets. She doesn't leave the bathroom. - I order pizza. - Or salad? - Mindi, you can go to Los Angeles. - Shouldn't we also stay? - No, we don't have twelve bedrooms. - Who takes care of Honey? - I'm her aunt. That's good. - Are you a personal trainer? No, I'm a veterinarian. But I do what I can. I'm boxing. Sims. We take quick walks. - Food and shopping, huh? - Who's gonna dress her? - We usually take care of ourselves. - We'll probably stop. It was very nice to meet, but you miss what the motorways? Promise not to let her out of sight. She doesn't understand her life. She thinks all cars have a minibar. She's naive. - The world knows her, not the other way around. - Thank you, which is wise. Thanks. Not to be like that, but she does has been in the bathroom for a while. Is there anything in there, like razor blade? - I have none right now. - Have you seen her armpits? Tablets, do you? - Not until Richard became hellfreak. - Your pink pills, huh? They are against acne. If she takes them, she'll be fine. - Aren't you too old for pimples? - Older Acne. It is also for middle-aged dogs. - They get it. - Honey! Mom is addicted of pain relief? Is she okay? No, she is addicted. Can you lie down and towel? I'm coming... God... She does not do well. I thought she was losing weight. - Before I meet her? - She can't receive visits. I didn't want to go here either release the single. I can't live here! Where was Mindi? - Honey, not ... - Caroline, how's it going? - Now it's seven years of bad luck. - Get you or me? - Caroline Morgan. - It's the "monkey girl" producer. Well, hey. I'm not involved in Honey's job. Good. A business lawyer doesn't have to take care of Honey's career. What's up with Beth? Mindi said that you sent Honey's people home. - That's not Beth. Where is she? - Honey lives with us, his people. - I don't need a business lawyer. - Get in touch when you want to buy a business. You're calm. You raised the sisters when the mother died? - Excuse me? - In the book. You're not the thick man. Katie is not thick, but I am took care of everything when mom died. - I can take care of Honey. - If our brand is damaged at all ... ... so we will sue you. Okay? Hi there. That's my song, Honey. You sleep with Harriet. I've been looking at something strange. - It's a quarter past three. - Three in the morning. - Honey's sick, come to the hospital. - The hospital? - She might be sick of the pizza. - I'm fine. Do you, honey? No, I'm getting tired. - Kangaroo! My kangaroo is gone! - Has she lost the kangaroo? From the charm bracelet! I got it from mom and it's gone ... It's gone! She's not sick, she has what Richard has. - Tennis elbow? - No, not tennis ... Panic Gesture. Forget the hospital. - Sorry, I got stuck with a chapter. - No, I'm glad you're there. - You have to cure Honey's panic anxiety. - Okay, I'll come home. I'm around the corner. - I don't like it here. It's awful. - Richard's office is up there. - He has drops. - Why is it off? What did he do in the health food business? Honey, how are you doing? Where's Caroline? Did she feel good? Caroline ... Uh ... Hi. Hall! You just left me out there! He wanted to tell you. You want some of that? Is Honey good? What is it? Why are you crying? I was worried about Honey, but she's fine now. - Honey, what's going on? - Please, lie down, Honey. Your dad has been cheating and will have children. - Huh? What is she talking about? - What kids? How can he have children? Hi, it's Beth Halloway. Leave a message after the beep. It's ready. Your mom is gone, so you have to approve it, old man. Keep going, little boy. - Can you make an egg white omelette? - Stick and burn. - Honey's gone. - What's away? Where did she go? - I don't know. She ran away. - Claire, you should have stopped her. How do I do that? Why? And what is one egg for an omelette? No, not the stairs. Honey! Stay. Honey! I'm having a heart attack! Frlt. Did it go well? - I haven't run so long. - I recognize you again. - I got to meet my mom. - She can't meet anyone. I'm not there, you don't know who am I? I'm gonna do whatever I want! I don't know what you are doing now. You should stay with us. I thought so, but I wanted to wait for your exams. - My exams were in November. - Yeah, I know, but ... Then it was Harriet's concert and then it was Christmas. I love you so much too. You realize how ironic it is that you have written self-helping books? - I wanted to meet the girls. - You just have to see a lawyer. Of course, that wasn't the only thing you got cheap in the health food business. Keisha asked me to tell the truth. - Keisha? Is her name Keisha? - She's ashamed of it. Me too. No one over 25 is named Keisha. How old is she? What does it matter? She's half your age and she bears your child. - We had separate bedrooms. - Before you arrive late after the "job". - You did. Is not everything my fault. - Yes, it really is. You couldn't make an effort my behalf? Get your own? Look at you! I chased my escaped niece. I should have been dressed better. That would be the first time! Did you get any pregnant? for not dressing up? Because you didn't love me. - I stayed with you for all those years! - It's not love, but perseverance! Do you know who you are? You're that guy! - The guy in the French movie! - The one with the dinner party? - He on the bus? - No, the old one who sticks! He understands his brother-in-law's life! There is no danger. I don't think I saw it. How's everything else? Hi. Mick Croyston with C. We're looking at the police station. I called, but you don't call. No danger, I'm just checking that everything is ready for tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Honey's photo shoot. - Yeah. Unfortunately, it hasn't been. - Yes. I booked a studio. My sister was dead and arrested when she agreed ... - It's getting rid of it. - No, I'll work. I don't want to shoot you. Ngonsin. Beth pays me well. Honey, are you in there? I want to ask about the deposit, for ... Mother! There's a guy in the tree with a camera.--------------Got you. Hi. I had to find Honey myself. It wasn't Honey, but my daughter. Which testicle do you want to keep? Lucky she didn't take the grass trimmer. - Delete the pictures. - If I get the plot with Honey. You know what you have to do. Come to the studio at 14. - Do you sell them otherwise? - I don't have much to choose. What do you think I'm getting for it? She has your eyes. What are you doing? Oh my God! Stop! Are you crazy? Did it go well? Does your mom pay him? Keep the doors locked and the blinds down. If you go, then I'm alone. I really had to get to work.

I have to change from the pajamas. One, two, three. - Glass? - Thanks, Harriet. I want to marry it. Thank you for making us feel good. I made a big point now. Look, the chocolate sorbet. - I'm human, not a chef. - Taste now. Yuk. I'm kidding, it was incredibly good. Victory is mine. Come and show me the girls Honey or prove that the flavors work? Tv flies. Look, Meg is smiling. She never smiles. She smiles, but I'm worried that she is not happy. That she can't be happy. Is that what we want our children to be? We have ideas on what to make, but after all, -We just want them to be happy. Want a glass of wine? - Did I say that loud? - Yes. - Yes to what? - Bade also. Okay. I was so gone that I knocked out mine brother's teeth. Before I live with that. Or he can live with it, he didn't talk to the dentist. The point is that I lost my brother and my wife. My friends. And the ability to have an erection. I must be worried about that Gavin's impotence, but I do now. - Please, please, Beth. - How does that help me? I don't want to talk to them, but with Honey. Snlla. That's the first time you pray to talk to your daughter. - Are you serious? - He really likes you. - He forced his number on you. - Don't let me interrupt the bastards.

How tragic can you get? I love you. See you. I'll get it them after the football. Hi there. - Hello. - Hello. Yes... It sounds embarrassing. This is true of Amelia's Instagram. She can't upload pictures Honey. I fixed the account to her. - No, you don't have to look. - Instagram, here we go. There is no danger. Forget it.

You're Australia's only shit that is not in Los Angeles. We'll hear you later. What kind of stuff, Honey? I'm your stuff! Katie? - What a shame. - Can we stay alone for a while? - He texted Honey. - I text her once. - To send a picturen on the rabbit. - Tell me what you wrote. Honey wrote:"Does it have that, the fat rabbit lost weight? " - He answered... - I answered... - "We have to eat these nachos, so hardly." - Like I was the fat rabbit! Not thick! You're like a Playboy rabbit. No money in mind. - Do you set the wedding over it? - You have no idea how humiliated I am. Yes, you look. Booked! The studio is called Please Cheese Me. - What more are there? - Just a text message about the rabbit. That's it. - "Please Cheese Me" studio? - I have to, for the sake of my mother. - He photographed Claire. - No. Yes. I trust him. - Are you gonna let him take you naked? - Huh?

We can take springs. I have a whip that can be fun. But your mom wants to show off what God has given you. Seriously? Nude Photos? One million hits in a day. She was high on tablets. It's okay to take nude pictures of you so that she becomes more knowledgeable? Fy. No ... Whatever the pill, think about it all the other crazy shit she's done. - Like she wrote the book. - Forget the book, kid. - What!!, after what she wrote? - Claire, there will be no lesson now! It's not Claire. - Did Mom tell you to drive? - I have my own car in Los Angeles. You're on the wrong side of the road. Where's Harriet? - Did it go well? - Fuck! Fuck me! Are you injured? Not? Good. Pack your stuff. Come here. Come on. Married is somewhere else. - Hi mom. Are you out? - No, honey. I'm still there. h, what I miss you, old man. - Honey, are you still there? - Why do you let the guys lick me? - Huh? What boys? - The guys licking me.

If your mom is booking nude photos I understand your weird view of guys. I'm thinking about the photo shoot and have approved the video. Your mother protected Harriet and lost job to protect you.
