SISTERS OR THE BALANCE OF FORTUNE A Film by Margarethe von Trotta And then they came upon a deep, dark forest. It was so dark there, so terribly dark, that soon they could not even see their hands in front of their faces. It was a black and ominous night. Only an owl broke the silence, hooting. Everything else was still. Morning was hours away and they were very frightened. After they had gone through the darkness for a time, holding tight to one another, their feet began to drag. Pleadingly the little sister said: "I am tired, dear sister. Let us rest a while." "If we rest now," answered the big sister, "wild animals will fall upon us while we sleep," "and we will never reach home." The tea is cold. I'll make you another. Thanks. I've already had several cups. Did you eat something? Let's go to an Italian restaurant to take your mind off it. - Soon you'll have passed. - Let's stay here. Alright. I'll prepare something here. What would you like? What you would like. I'll make Zabaglione for dessert. She's impossible. I put in a full day, too. She could do something well. They wanted to see which animals and plants had survived the atomic blast. To their surprise the island was swarming with huge, well-fed rats. The animals showed no trace of genetic damage from radiation. If rats cannot be destroyed by A-bombs, will they not one day inherit the earth? At least you could've emptied the trash. Don't. I'll do it. But it's quickly done. No, you've got other things on your mind. Please, leave it. You had a busy day? As always. Münzinger finalized an amazing deal. He's a transaction genius. You enter angel-like, Miss Sudermann. Here? Have you read it? I heard it on this morning's radio. - And what do you think? - Yes, it's dreadful. Mr. Münzinger, you wanted to dictate your Italian Trade Board address, and you have a meeting at eleven. I've assembled the documents. Want them now or after dictation? Bring them now. By the way, Miss Sudermann, do you know anyone who could type my son's thesis? Naturally, someone of intelligence. I can do it. That I can't expect... I demand too much of you as it is. No, no, that won't do. Perhaps some university student. Isn't there a temporary job office? But I really would like to do it. It's a change for me. You are an angel... You'll see, it is truly an exceptional piece of work: "The Hero and his Weather". Heading: "Procedural Rules for Multi-National Undertakings." Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. I warmly thank you for the invitation to dine with you and address you today. I followed the initiative of your group, not only because I hope to be able to pass on to you something now, but also because I can once again be in Italy, a land to which I am tied through a special bond. My very first trip outside of my country led me here. At that time my foster parents gave me the sum of 500 marks. With this money, I was able to enjoy four weeks in Northern Italy which began my unbroken affection and admiration for your Homeland... Before I begin my topic in detail, I should explain briefly the object of procedural rules, the MNU itself and its origins. Every time I come in, you're here. Aren't you from the third floor? Yeah. But the paper's softer here. Do you happen to have some lipstick? I forgot mine. - Thanks. - And where do you work? I am Mr. Münzinger's secretary. I'd like to meet his son. Next time he comes, will you let me know? My name's Miriam Grau. Who are you? - Sudermann. - And your first name? Maria. Will you do it, Maria? No. And now will you please return to your desk! We have seen how a single fertilized egg cell can produce an organism with the most varied cell types: muscle, cartilage and brain cells. Finally, we should ask if irreversible variations of genetic material are necessary for cell differentiation. An answer has become evident through John Gurdon's nuclear transplantation experiments which I'd like to illustrate: In unfertilized eggs the cell nucleus, and with it the entire genetic material of the egg cell, was destroyed by ultra-violet radiation and replaced with a nucleus from an intestinal cell, for example. Frog eggs treated in this manner produced a high percentage of normal, fully-developed frogs. These nuclear transplantation experiments show that a differentiated cell still contains the entire genetic information necessary for the formation of an organism. The differentiation must therefore take place through selective gene activation. In the next lecture I would like to discuss the problem of gene regulation, above all, the question of how specific genes are activated in a given cell at a given time. To manipulate genes, but not to be able to deal with love. At work all this time? Yes, where else? Somewhere else... with other people... you can't work all the time... In that case, I would have called. Moreover, at the moment I'm typing a dissertation for Münzinger's son. "The Hero and his Weather." Are you crazy? You're typing it? How did that happen? Because Münzinger asked me. That's not a secretary's job... you wouldn't want to type mine. And how do you know that? Listen: without my working, you couldn't continue with your studies! And after they had walked for some time in the never-ending forest, the little sister asked again: "Oh, dearest sister, let us sit and rest awhile." "My feet cannot carry me further." "I promise I will not close my eyes." Is the program for Job No. 16 ready? With luck, in ten minutes. Can't you rush it? No. The computer's not as fast as you. I'll bring it up to you immediately. In the meantime, have a cigarette. Mr. Stangl, a cigarette for the lady. Thanks, I must run. What type of fur coat would fit her personality? Goat? Polar bear... You're doing a great job. Can you understand it all? I mean, is it too boring and academic? On the contrary, I really want to read the books that you refer to. I'll give them to you. If you weren't my father's secretary, I'd fall in love with you. Is my father in? He's in Milan today. When does he return? First flight tomorrow, probably. Can I have a coffee? Certainly. You take milk? No, black, please. I was waiting for you. We said you'd tell me when he comes. Who? You know, the boss' son. I really want to meet him. And what do you expect from that? It's just that... I can't stand this stinking place. Did you ever work above, in the Glass Hall? Do you know where he goes at night? - No. - Or if he likes to dance? I really don't know, Miss Grau. Miriam... And what's his first name? Will you stop this childishness? Maurice... He won't fall in love with you! Why not? He doesn't even know me yet. Why Maurice? Is he French? As a girl, I think his mother adored Maurice Chevalier. Who's that? A French singer. I'd like to sing. Like Billie Holiday. Can you give me a lift into the city? It's O.K. with me. You say you have to work so hard just to support me. But you need me so that I'll need you. That's how it really is... I have such a headache! Go to bed. I'll bring you some tea. Can you imagine that several copies of yourself exist? What do you mean? How you look: your eyes, your hair, your hands. Or your qualities: intelligence, energy... There are plenty of top secretaries. You aren't replaceable. No, Anna, everyone is. Yet something else is worrying you. I'm losing faith in all that I've learned. Tell me about it. I'm totally alone in my faithlessness. How so? All the others ultimately just want to show off their knowledge. You should see how frantically they take down all the Professor's words. Maybe exhaustion has a lot to do with your doubts? No, Maria. Until now man has never renounced knowledge or science, simply because it could be misused. I won't be a part of that. I really want to quit... I want to do something else. But you can't give up everything just before the end. That's unthinkable. Just take your exam and then we'll see. Anyway, I'm convinced: as soon as you start doing research, you'll like it. Who's there? Are you the young lady the university job service sent? Yes, I am. It's a pleasure. Come right in. It's cold out. Straight ahead, last door on the left. The last young lady didn't wipe her feet and left tracks on the carpet. And my sister had just cleaned it. Please sit down. There's the desk and we'll start immediately. Frenzl, he's my gardener in Vienna. May I open the drapes? No, don't! I want to offer you something. A piece of cake. And in a moment you'll get a cup of hot chocolate. Did you remember the stationery I asked you to get? Is it pale pink? It wasn't at all easy to find. You can always find pale pink! Well then, I paid the last young lady ten marks for an hour. Is that agreeable to you? Yes, thank you. Yes, let's start right in and write my niece in New York. First write the address. No, first the letter. Dear Gretl. "There has been much snow here." Can one say that? I'm out of touch. No, don't write that. It's stupid to talk about the weather. Who is it? It's me. Is that you, Frieda? Yes. Who else should it be! I always return from my walk at five. Did she make you something to drink? I'll take care of it. That's my sister. She always scolds me because everything is so untidy here. While she's out, could you help pick up a bit? I don't know anything about it since I sleep during the day. Anna! What's wrong? Have you been waiting long? Lately I can only concentrate when you're there... I got you a present. A Buddha... For your patience... He too has patience... Don't worry, I didn't buy it with your money. I worked today. Why did you do that? But you wanted me to earn money. Anna, you always misunderstand. You need your time for yourself... My dearest, dearest sister. Miss Sudermann needs a typist and wants you. Thank you. But he's not here! You'll work here the whole week since I'm behind. Here's your desk. Now you won't be able to go to the restroom so often. You should learn languages, Miriam. It's better than waiting for men. Do you write shorthand? Not well. I always get headaches. It's strange... Here, make a clean copy. It has to go out today. Here is the letterhead and here are the carbons... Mr. Münzinger expects you. May I help you? Yes, you could introduce me! Of course. My new assistant, Miss Grau. Mr. Edelschneider. You should exchange names. What does he do? Mr. Edelschneider is our head programmer. An excellent worker. Programmer. Why aren't you married? No private conversations, please. Just got over the day again, smiled, ate, loved out of a can... so it's been. Then burst through the confines, tried to breathe and into beer I slipped, staring at girls, sipping at beauty, pursing up lips. Yet I wish I'd felt a bit of life today, lusty, lazy, just flesh unbounded, as they say. Alright. You see exactly what I'm going through, and yet, asshole that you are, you ask: how do you do? It could be better, but let's face it, stranger, if you do what you want, you're living in danger. Freedom exists for all those who ride you, free you'll be only, if you do what they want you to. Was that the surprise? The first. Just got over the day again, looked for reasons and yet laughed in the void for no reason at all. Blinded by freedom, barricaded by order, danced 'round the golden calf, faithful to a higher order... Yet it's high time to turn the wheel of history, knock down facades and take responsibility. Alright. You know exactly such a wind isn't blowing, and yet, asshole that you are, you ask: how do you do? It could be better, but let's face it, stranger, if you do what you want, you're living in danger. Freedom exists for all those who ride you. Free you'll only be, if you do what they want you to. If they do what they want you, if they do what they want you. He wants you, and you've known it all along. No, really not. I assure you. It doesn't matter. The main point is, he's in love with one of us. We're friends now, aren't we? You're freezing. Come on, I'll get you into bed. Please get Mr. Münzinger's signature. But it's five already and Friday. Please, Miriam. Do you feel better? I'll be home at eight. And you? Coming? We must check next week's plan. I don't get it. You aren't his wife. Here, for hunger. Meeting Maurice? Maybe. Get going. You might miss him. Have fun. We need a cafeteria. I'm afraid we'll be working late again. Here... look at this. All the letters in complete disorder! Your Miss Grau didn't consider it important to put them in order again. She had a date she didn't want to miss. Anyway, this girl doesn't seem to be very qualified. Isn't there anyone better upstairs? She's still very young... My son already had his first diploma at eighteen... in sailing. Why live a double life? I'd die of boredom otherwise. You could just sing. Not in Germany. Unless you want to sing Schmalz: "The night was bright, I awakened with you, my Anita..." And in America? Why don't you go there? Because I want to sing my own texts and be understood. That I can do only in German. I'd like to sing, too. - Did you ever try? - Just for myself. Then I'll show you now. I'd like to sing like Billie Holiday. My, but you're modest! Come on, Miss Holiday. You know "The Man I Love"? Billie Holiday stood there totally motionless... She didn't do anything but sing. Out of herself. I don't know English. You know, trees were holy for the Druids? For them they possessed magic powers. Trees fixed the Celt's calendar year, and each tree represented a season. The birch was the tree of Beginning, first to open its leaf-buds each spring. Therefore it is the tree of life and has the power to banish evil spirits. Stop... please stop! You're staying for dinner? Sorry, mom, but I have a date. - Oh, how wonderful! With whom? - Who are you meeting? Maurice, the son of Münzinger... he always asks me, and I turned him down... I'm happy. Is he as nice as his father? Almost empty. I'll make a fresh pot. - Let me do it. - No. You stay here. I can manage. Why mention it only now? You've known it since yesterday... You've known it all the time, at breakfast and on the drive here... Yes, of course... Then you thought only about him for the whole ride... and only pretended to listen to me. You were thinking of "the boss' son." You're so narrow-minded! Oh, so narrow- and small-minded, just like your daily world at the office... Remember how I played with Mischa I really liked him and you cut yourself on some glass, so I'd pay attention to you again. Someday it must stop. There must be a way for each of us to live her own life. Once your test is behind you, everything will probably be a little easier... As easy as it is for you, you mean. For you everything is so very easy. Look how much mother wanted us to stay! We do too little as it is. You can stay. Here. Have you seen what she's reading! Poems by Lenau, driven mad by sadness. While leafing through a book, I came upon a faded rose, crushed flat, and know no longer whose hand plucked it for me. More and more my memory flies away on evening breezes, soon my world shatters and I no longer know who loved me. Be still! If mother hears! Can't you see what that means! She feels old and alone since father's death. And knowing that, you can be so calm? My tears won't help. Now stop this torture, Anna. Your only torture is having to wait two more hours until you see him. If I had an exam coming up, I'd be studying and nothing else. You're clever and heartless. Stop it! You'll pass the exam, Anna. You're so intelligent. Isn't it so, Maria? Of course she'll pass. More cake, moma? Yes, please. - And you? - No, thank you. You could spend the night with me and take the train back tomorrow. I found some letters from father which he wrote you when you were children, and we could read them once again, Anna. My sister says she feels boxed in. Can't you help her? I don't know how. That's bad. When fear gets too big, it can destroy you. We've talked the whole time about her. Tell me about you! What don't you know already? Why didn't you go to college? When my father died, mother had the feeling that she too would soon die. So she took me out of class and sent me to a professional trade school... I'm happy to work for your father. Coming home with me? Let's not rush things. Coward! No, you misunderstand... I'm so seldom with people... at night. Anna, I know a good way to get through an exam. It's simple. You imagine the whole thing as theater and you act the part of a good student. Life... world theater... with a happy end. - Are you still angry? - No. Really? I dreamed I was facing a mirror, and yet I saw only the back of my head. When I turn around, I couldn't see my face. Anna, look at me! Wouldn't you like to join us tonight? I'm sure you'd like Maurice. No, Maria, I'd rather work. And you won't take any pills? No, I promise. Good. - Do you often sleep with men? - No. I'm an exception? Then you love me! Not yet. I am breaking a law of nature. Please, I don't want to have to speak with anyone. Am I talking too much? No. No letter, not a single word left behind! Have you really looked everywhere? It would have been so comforting... Perhaps she was sick. Had she seen a doctor lately? No. Always the same questions, the same thoughts, because I just can't grasp it. Can you understand it? No. I should have kept her here. I shouldn't have let her leave with you. Maybe then she'd still be alive. Don't blame yourself. May I keep this? Yes, of course. I'll take this out. The dream I have of life robs me of life. I am calm, only my fear is growing. For Maria. Place a stone on my face, when I am dead. Drive a stake through my breast to keep me from haunting you. Chop off my hand, when I am dead, bury it at the Way of the Cross, that I won't rise up to torment you. I took my own life in opposition to you. You alone are the target of my death. Beware of me. I almost went against my principles and drove into the city to see you. But my sister had the feeling you'd come. Please, come in. What are you writing? I am recording my dreams... Do sit down. You should have brought Anna here... You could've freed her from fear? Not I, perhaps, but the countryside. It always helps me. I can't understand it. I also don't want to. I shared everything with her... Also her torment? But she tormented me, not the other way. How can you say that with certainty? Didn't you want to make her into a person who acted just like you? I wanted to help her. And success would've helped. Not to want it can be a sign of life. Not if death is the result. Can I stay with you for a while? I won't bother you. Thanks. I'll read you one of my dreams, if you wish. Dream from the night of June 5th. I break into an empty house in a village surrounded by the enemy. I advance cautiously, always under cover so as not to be seen, fearing shots not only from inside but from outside as well. I find a room whose walls are freshly painted. The room is bare except for a table standing in its center. On it lies a beautiful red apple. I take the apple and leave the house and continue my escape, without knowing where I am going... It's good to have an audience. I like the red apple. How's your new book doing? Selling well? No, not so well. I'm sorry. Fritz, whenever I try to sleep I feel Anna's ghost will appear... I'm so afraid. Do you feel guilty? No. Anna always thought only of herself. To me, she refused to give up any part of herself. Success, which you so wanted for her, Maria, depends on how you package and sell yourself. You have to be able to offer your personality, knowledge, and talents as advantageously as possible. At that, she was as bad as I. Your explanation works only for you. Anna stretched out her studies to avoid having to prove herself. What a man can do and what he is worth is shown in his profession and work. You really believe that nonsense? If not, I couldn't get up in the morning. I'm Miriam Grau, a friend of Maria. Her mother said she's here. - She went to the dike. - And how do I get there? Take my bicycle. I phoned every Sudermann in Hamburg! Until I reached your mother. She told me everything. We were often here as children. During vacations. Did you say something? You definitely spoke. Maybe in a dream. Go back to sleep. I dreamed we went to America. You, Robby and me... Let me in. That's an idea! You with your languages, Robby certainly could be a great singer, and maybe I could too. I know a little English already. Sorry, Maria... Why go to America? Nothing happens here... Sing a bit more. Dream of February 19-20th. Across a vast wasteland, I approach a city - comma - which never becomes visible - comma - although I should have arrived there long ago - period - Along the way, my father meets me and says, the landscape is beautiful, the path rewarding. What? Again! You want to learn English... If you wish, you can go to language school. I'll pay. What? Do you mean it? And later I won't need my fourth floor job? No. I'll cover lessons. - Really? - Yes. You're unhappy working here? What don't you like? Or have you a better offer? No, that's not it. I want to stop altogether. I just want to sing, write my own words and music, and for that I need time. Yes, I remember, my son mentioned your vocal talents. But can you live off them? That I don't know yet. I only know, you must devote yourself fully to one thing. If you want to be good, you have to take chances. But you are good. We're always very satisfied with your work. It has nothing to do with your satisfaction, Mr. Münzinger, but with mine. A pity, Mr. Edelschneider. One good employee less... A real pity. Miss Sudermann! Maurice! I just told him you would certainly approve his decision. Mr. Edelschneider is leaving us. To sing. Did you want to see me? Yes... after a word with Miss Sudermann. Coward! - See you tonight? - Tonight's bad. Tomorrow, then. Tomorrow's also not good. Miss Sudermann, could you please order us a snack? It'll be a late night. Certainly. Your son is on his way. Was I... was it something I did, Maria? I don't understand you. One moment, please. I'll connect you. As you see, I really have no time. This weekend? This weekend I must spend with my mother... she lives alone. Apparently you also want to. - How's it going? - Fine, thanks. And with Maurice? Also fine. How far are you? Already up to lesson fifteen. Lovely! I wanted to ask you, if you'd like to move into my apartment. It's not right for you to still live at home. I could also help with vocabulary drills, etc. What do you think? I'm living with Robby. But I can't stay - he's going on tour. So will you move in? Of course. Should I tell your parents? You're not marrying me! Great, eh? The bedroom's already done. I like your hair like that! Keep it that way. Sundays we often took boat rides with Anna. What was Anna like? You've never said. Did she look like you? Was she pretty? Yes, very pretty. Do you have a photo? You don't have a single photo? No. Not one. That was a long trip! Trip? Maria told me about it. Was it exciting? Let's have a drink! Dinner's soon. She lied to you. How so? Perhaps she could explain it best. Maria doesn't like a lot of questions... So, you weren't traveling at all? Does she ever mention me? To be truthful, no. But she'll be overjoyed you're here. You know, I was in love with, you... even before you fell for Maria! Why didn't I see it! Certainly would've been less complicated! Join us. I'll get another plate. You told your friend I was traveling... I waited the whole time for a call or note from you. I can't. I simply can't. - Do I disgust you? - No... on the contrary. You shouldn't have let him in. Why not? Don't worry. I'm not after him, and he's not after me. Nevertheless, don't let him in again. Dammit, I can't do that. I don't even know him. After all, he's your boyfriend. Not any more. Sometimes I can't understand you. I'm going to the club tonight. Robby's in town for a few days. Please, Miriam. Don't start with that again. You need your energy for studying. Afterwards you can do as you wish. I'm friends with Robby, and I want to stay friends. You can see him in the daytime... Late nights aren't good for you. Please, Miriam! Okay... there are only girls in the class. Everyone wants to be a secretary. But so do you! Just got over the day again... smiled, ate, loved out of a can... so it's been. Then burst through the confines, tried to breathe and into beer I slipped, staring at girls, sipping at beauty, pursing up lips. Yet I wish I'd felt a bit of life today, lusty, lazy, just flesh unbounded, as they say. Alright. You see exactly what I'm going through, and yet, asshole that you are, you ask: how do you do? It could be better, but let's face it, stranger, if you do what you want, you're living in danger. Freedom exists for all those who ride you, free you'll be only, if you do what they want you to. If they do what they want you, if they do what they want you. Not sleeping? You have to leave early. You, too. Don't you have a test tomorrow? I'll pass it easily. Seems like you're not taking things seriously... What you don't learn now is hard to pick up later. I refer also to discipline. But, Robby is in Hamburg only three days. Don't you understand? I said, you can see him during the day. If you had only called, I could've slept. I was so afraid something had happened... I'm sorry, Maria... Executive Secretary Secretary Qualified Secretary Secretary Complete Secretary Did Anna sleep in the same bed I'm using? Near the end she went to bed first, in case I had to get up again. How did she kill herself? Was she lying in my bed when you found her? She was sitting at your desk. Sitting? The desk and rug were soaked with blood. I wiped up everything. She slit her wrists and watched, as the blood slowly left her body, flowed over the desk and onto the floor. Until unconscious. She watched herself die. Anna was always more starved for love than Maria. Maria is much like my late husband, she was also his favorite. She knew early what she wanted... Anna, on the other hand... always had so many wishes, impossible to fulfill... she had an unchecked imagination... but she was inclined to melancholy, just like I am. With marriage and children, there's at least no time to notice it. And fear? Was she afraid? No. She really wasn't afraid, no... that's why I can't see why she did it, with only her exams to go. Now it's as if I had lost both children. Maria rarely comes by. I don't want to force her, I know I reopen her memory of Anna. Shall I come to visit? Gladly. Thank you. That would please me very much. That way I'd hear a bit about Maria. Maria did everything for Anna. Cared for her, made her studies possible, paid for everything... I couldn't, with my husband's death... Maria doesn't know how oppressive her proficient manner can be for others. She slaps me in the face with it, puts me on edge and makes my mind spin. I don't ever want to become like her. That's the way you prepare, I see? That's English too... Old English... that you'll hardly use. Don't you feel well? I don't know. I don't feel like doing a thing. Shall we go out to eat? I don't care. Or to a movie? If you want to... - To you! - To us! I already talked with Personnel. Next month a place opens up in Export, the girl's marrying. As soon as you have your diploma, you start. Can't I hold off for awhile? But why? I'll have to type the whole day, except now it's English. How does that differ from upstairs? Because you make 2500 typing, and you have chances for advancement... Chances for advancement. In a few years we'll all be replaced by computers... Where did you hear such nonsense? Münzinger himself is doing it right now. That you must know. But only on the lowest level. Good executive secretaries are always needed. They are irreplaceable. In ten years there won't be any workers. What rubbish! In other words, you don't want to work, and I'm to support you. What are you thinking? I'm not a work-horse. No, it's impossible. Really. I feel like celebrating. Going dancing. You can come, if you want. We'll have this out first. Give me those. Here, your earrings. I am not your sister. I read her diary. I saw her pictures. You wanted me to kill myself, just like Anna. What are you saying! This warmth: now just don't lose anything, 'cause the new day has yet to be versed. Very soon one will be freezing again, and one is so helpless, when one is freezing. Suddenly the sky turns fire, and the shopgirls awaken. This day surely won't be special, and one accepts life, once again, as it is. Just one last dip in the beers left standing. Oh, quickly, before the night dies out. Someone will be freezing frightfully tomorrow, and it's no good, when one is freezing. Miriam, I beg your forgiveness! What about our trip? You've dreamed of it for so long... A trip with you... I'd rather drown myself! Booze knocks fears aside, laughing free. I'd gladly fade out along with the stars. You forgot something. I'll pay back everything... some time or other... definitely. Once again you enter like an angel. Ernst Buch is dead. Would you see to it that we send condolences and a wreath. On the ribbon: ...what did we use last time? In deep mourning... This time we'll write: "In Respect and Gratitude", or "Not to Be Forgotten". Very well, Mr. Münzinger. Good night, Mr. Klausen. I'm missing a piece of sky. You still have the whole night. Thank you. Good night, Miss Sudermann. I will attempt to dream in the course of my life. I will endeavor to be Maria and Anna.
