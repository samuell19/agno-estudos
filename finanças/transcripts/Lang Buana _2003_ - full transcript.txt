A long time ago, the Malay Peninsula was in chaos. A long time ago, the Malay Peninsula was divided. That was then… when shaved ice wasn't even created and Syarifah Aini wasn't a singer yet. DJ Dave, Hail Amir, and Mary Sia Ling Ling weren't singers yet. And the story took place between these periods. Lang Buana. Ready. Be on your toes. Be on your toes, everybody. Listen. Right flank, rise. Rise, everyone. Attack! Ouch! -Daik! -Watch it! Steady, Daik. Get out of the water. How did you fall into the water? Hold on to the stick! I'll pull you up. Daik! Get on board! Watch him. It's so tiring. Oh, my. I'm gonna have a seizure. Gosh. What's wrong with you guys? I'm a friend of the river, you know. I'm starving. Why can't you be more patient? But I'm starving! Don't worry. We're not far from the city. Did you hear that? A city. We'll have a feast there. Can we? We're broke. We've been rafting for four days. And we haven't seen any cities. Not even one. You can always drink from the river. I can't drink from the river or from the swamp anymore. I've had enough. I need clean water. The water tastes better here, though. It's a bit salty. What do you mean? Try it yourself. Hey, I think you should stop drinking now. What do you mean stop? You wanted me to drink from the river. I like the taste. There's too many of them. There's a war here. That explains it. They died two days ago. Hey. We're here. It's the city. We're here. Finally, we've reached the city. Why is there smoke around here? Sir, you have me. You don't need anybody else. I'm totally reliable. Run! -Welcome. -My lord. It is I, Datuk Merewang, who sent you the letter. How was your journey, princes? And how is the king doing? He must've mistaken us for someone else. We don't look like princes, do we? The king is in perfect health, Datuk. What? He sends his regards to you. Really. Thank you. -I welcome you to Lang Buana City. -Please. Welcome, princes. Ouch. The city looks weird to me. Perhaps there was an attack recently. Look. -He must've died of a heart attack. -No, he didn't. What do you mean? He died young. Why are there so many dead people, Datuk? This is why we had hoped for your arrival here. Their attacks are getting stronger. Did you say you were attacked? Yes. And they'll keep attacking us until we bow down to Sang Nira. He really is a formidable foe. He's a ruthless oppressor. And he's heartless, too. He kills people mercilessly by death sentence… and anal impalement. He has no mercy. Hey! We need to make money. Weigh them properly. How long will our journey take? Five days on foot if you hike the hills, sir. But I can take you through the woods in just one day. You'd only rush us. We'll track them by the river. They thought they could run from me. No one can run from Orang Kaya of Sri Bentan. Do you hear me? Yes, Orang Kaya. Good. I can stomp on ants, and I can surely stomp on these three monkeys. -Orang Kaya. -What? But ants are too small. They're African ants. They're bigger. You're talking about African ants. But this is the Malay Peninsula. Everything here comes in smaller sizes. They get as big as cats when they're older. I've never seen an ant the size of a cat. Have you? No. But I saw one as big as a match head. But in Mentakab they are as big as your fist. If you get bitten… -You can't if they're as big as cats. -I'm not lying to you. Hey! Would you shut up? It's time to go! Look! It's the enemy! Coming through! Stop! Why did you come here? If it's from Sang Nira, I won't read it. We'll never bow to him. We won't! We'll fight to the death! We will! Wait. We are ready for his next attack for we have three princes with us. We're stronger than before. Are you looking for a fight? Are you human or a tiger? His body is full of tattoos. We're not intimidated! Consider yourself lucky, for you have such legacies. But don't get too cocky, for we are feared by our enemies! My heart is crying, for it is longing for something. If a fight is what you're looking for, rest assured we're your strongest foe. I can't comprehend what he was saying. Enjoy the drinks. What do we do now? I think we better tell them the truth. Yes, I think you're right. But we better keep it a secret until it's the right time to tell them. For now, let them think that we're princes. That's more like it. No, I don't think that's right. We'd be cursed if we continue with this. I don't want to get huge feet. -Seriously? -Yes. It's bad to mock the royal descent. You'd get cursed with huge feet. Now, imagine it. After you. -My lord. -My lord. My lord. The food will be ready any moment now. Thank you for your patience. Datuk Merewang… What do you want, Kiambang? -My lord. -What? -Show them your respect. -To whom? I mean them. Datuk, Sir Frank Mocking Power is here to assist us in the battle, with six cannons and 17 hand grenades. What did they bring? He must love grenades so much. Tell them to leave. I don't need any help from the white men. You can't trust them. But he brought 53 rifles. I'd lose the city to them. Kiambang. Yes. I'm the brightest in Lang Buana City. I think you better leave. I don't need your help. These princes have come to our rescue. What? Talk to him, Gunung. -Yes, talk to him. -What should I talk to him about? Anything. We're princes, remember? We're expected to be eloquent. He's right. Just tell him that it's time to bathe ourselves. All right. What happened to him? He's having a seizure. How can he fight now? He's having a seizure. Forgive me, elephant's foot. -Forgive me, elephant's foot. -Gunung! Frank, white men are deceitful. Cut it out already! But we sincerely want to help you defeat Sang Nira. Our intentions are pure, Datuk. He's right, Datuk. And he brought six cannons. Kiambang, don't get fooled by their kindness. It will only backfire. Kiambang, this will be yours if he changes his mind. Datuk, you'd lose without their hand grenades. I saw them here! Good. I think they're somewhere near here. I really want to break their necks. But I'm scared. What are you scared of? Of ghosts. They don't lurk around during the day. They do. -Where do you see them? -Over there. Look, Orang Kaya. Haslam, do the honor. Wow! We just hit the jackpot. What are you waiting for? This is our trove. You can take as much as you want. You have a lot here. Who do these treasures belong to? Actually, we are… Actually, we're delighted, Datuk. I thought you wanted to tell them the truth. I just changed my mind. What's the matter? Nothing. I wonder how the king is doing now. Is he doing well? He just got back from Hajj. It's his 14th time. Right, friends? I mean, brothers. He's too much. Thank you for the gifts, Datuk Merewang. We're terribly exhausted. So please excuse us. Thank you. And goodbye. But before that… you must defeat Sang Nira. What, we have to fight him? I'm doomed. I don't want any of these. You can take them back. Well, if you don't trust me, you can keep the key to the box. Here. Give way, please. Make way. I don't think we should fight. Sure, the treasure is tempting. But we're lying to them. No, we're not. We are just trapped. What do you mean? They need motivation to fight for their sovereignty. Now they are motivated again because of our presence here. But they think we're the king's heirs. We're just commoners. Look at our clothes. They're poorly made from sack threads. Do we look like princes? We better come out to them. You blew it. I was about to tell them, but you stopped me. Do you want to run back to the Orang Kaya? What? We managed to break free. Are you losing faith already? No, I'm not. Haven't we suffered enough? We were servants for three long years. That's what happened when we accepted the Orang Kaya's assistance. We were fooled by his kindness. We lost our land, and we were sold as slaves. It's you. I'll play you a song. Your loan payment is due. I'm sorry, but my stomach's aching. I'll pay you next month. Tie him up with them. Ouch! I'm sorry. Peace be upon you. How do you do? Watch it. What's this? -I'm hungry. -What did I do wrong? Do you have food to spare? Shut up. You're always hungry. Move faster, or you'll get it from me. Left, right, left… Left, right, left… Left, right, left… Idiot, are you blind? What a nuisance! Another idiot. -Hi, Gondrong. -Hi, Gondrong. -How are you, Gondrong? -Hi, Gondrong. -I'm good. -Hi, Gondrong. Hey! What an idiot! Get to work! Gondrong, beat him up. You asked for it. Ouch! My eyes! Palm trees grow by the sea, a hen lays eggs in a pot. Returning what you borrowed is easy. But returning a favor is not. I will never be enslaved again. I'd rather die here. I didn't think… I'd die in this city. We'll die with honor. All right, I'm with you on this. We'll fight for the country. And die as heroes. We're in the wrong place and time. But we still have to make things right. At least, it's our last contribution. I know. The fair girl is mine. What are you looking at? I'm not intimidated by you. Hey! My lord. Kiambang! Hey, didn't you see me walking? How stupid can you be? Please come in. This is Fuad. He's my nephew. He's brave. He can defeat six people with one blow. How did he get injured? He stubbed his toe. And he passed out. -He didn't get to fight. -I see. Never mind, there's always another day, Fuad. They have taken care of your wound. And they're here to assist us in battle. Don't make that silly mistake again in battle. And wear your sandals. You might step on nails or other pointy and sharp objects. She's a beauty. -Is this the medicine? -Yes. Do you feel better? You're a hero. I must serve the country, my prince. You can be informal with me. Just talk to me like a commoner. A commoner like me must respect the royals. But I see myself as a commoner. What's your name? -My name is Che Pah. -I see. But you can call me Aini. -Oh, Aini. -Syarifah Aini. What a beautiful name! And I'm Daik. But the commoners call me Dave. DJ Dave. What a great name. Hey, what are you waiting for? Get back to work now! Hey, you! If it were up to me, I'd have tortured them to death. You're right, Kiambang. I will no longer be polite to them. They will taste the greatest pain for trying to flirt with Che Pah. It can wait, Daud. We're preparing for a battle and we need to stay focused. The right time will come, okay? It's always been me. Me! You might not know this, but Kesuma is in love with me. You guys smell. Just count your blessings, will you? Are they Sang Nira's army? They're agile. Perhaps they're mercenaries. Maybe Temenggung was referring to them the other day. Who might they be? They don't concern me. You must get the three stooges for me. They can't run away from me. LANG BUANA We'll head to Lang Buana City. Paddle faster. Faster. When was the city built? About 50 years ago. It was built by the Dutch to store ore. And then they left. But before the demise of the late king, he bestowed the city to my grandfather. And later it was passed down to his son, Datuk Merewang. Sang Nira has been tirelessly trying to take over the city. Who is Sang Nira? He's my father's youngest brother. Ayah Cor traveled as far as Japan. He thinks he should be the successor instead of my father. He traveled for years. Upon his return, he devised a plan to invade the city. Some say he has gone mental. And he wants power. He's terrible. I always cruise through here. But I've never heard of this before. Why didn't you drop by, my prince? I'd be pleased if you would speak with me informally. You can call me Kanda. I love to roam the country. Why is that? To broaden my mind. You must have met someone. No, I'm still single. But I might find love here in the city. Too bad, I'm just a commoner. Why is that bad? I can only hope to marry someone like you. I found one! I'm sorry. -Bercabang! Gunung! -Hold it properly, will you? Bercabang! Gunung! Daik! I mean, Prince Daik. We were looking for you, dear brother. I just found another sign. Another sign? We'll be outnumbered. They have a huge army. We will not stand a chance. They can move swiftly in the water, too. Really? I don't feel good about this. I think I need something to cool down. I believe you. Training them is useless now as we won't stand a chance against Sang Nira's huge army. Why don't we seek help from someone who knows the art of war? You're right. Are you talking about the Orang Kaya of Sri Bentan? No, not him. Not him, of course. You know better. You know how to read and ride a bicycle. He's right. When we were enslaved, you told me that you were always traveling. You must have contacts that can help us. Let me think. Go faster! Faster! Paddle faster! Why is he always in a rush? The letter contains a secret. Well, he should help paddle, too. We get paid peanuts. Plus, he didn't even pay for our uniform. Cenuk, how far are we from Lang Buana City? It's just a cigarette away from here. Then we're nearly there. You'll get it from me if we don't reach there by then. What are you smoking? Please light it up for me. You're too much. I see a drift log, Orang Kaya. Don't just tell me. Avoid it. There's another one, Orang Kaya. Are you stupid? You know what to do when you see it. Watch out. There's a boulder. What do we do? Just hit it. It can take an impact. They kept on walking. My lord. Would they really help us, my lord? Never hurts to try. We need all the help we can find. I've tried to ask them for help before, but… They're arrogant and proud. And they don't have grenades. Why are you so obsessed with grenades? You should ask for help from the strongest ally. Not from them. Or from these three stooges. Kiambang, don't be rude to them. Datuk, I think you should appoint me as commander. I'm more than capable. And handsome. It's not your time yet, Kiambang. You're gonna need more than looks. Even if your hair, nails, and clothes are properly groomed and you have a fancy bicycle, you'll still need more than that, Kiambang. You'll still need a hand from the lords. Why won't you give me a chance? I will keep the city safe. Like my… Like my virginity. He's still a virgin. My lords, I suggest that these three tag along. I think that's the best. Nothing better than that. After you. Please. Hey! You're useless! That's why we look like commoners. Xin-Xin. Were you born here? No, I was not born here. Where are your parents now? Are they in Kepong? Puchong? Bentong? Kampar. Oh, Kampar! Would you like to hear me play the lute? Wait here. Ouch! She's mine. Ouch! I don't always play music for a girl. But when I do, it means I have fallen in love. I'm flattered, my lord. Ouch! I don't think you feel the same. Because I don't have the looks. I do! But why? Because you sincerely helped us. Fatso, run! Stupid! I'd cross the ocean for you. Cenuk, how far are we from there? Just a cigarette away. That's what you said yesterday. I wasn't able to smoke because the raft hit the boulder and we were thrown into the water. I have to let the cigarette dry first. You and your excuses. I just lost my motivation. You're too sensitive and soft. You made me feel terrible. I know I'm dispensable. You may go. I will find them myself. Wira! Coming, Orang Kaya. It's time to go to Lang Buana City. Can we go home after that? Yes, you can. And you'll get something in return. What will we get? I hope it's not fruits again. We've had enough. What do you want then? I've talked to them. We'd like to own a piece of land. Really? A piece of land each. All right. I'll fulfill your request. Six buckets of dirt each. Quit with your nonsense. Move! I want to go home. May I have your attention, please? The wrongdoers will be punished. And today… take this punishment as an example and a lesson to all of us. -Do you understand? -Yes. Thus, we'll now punish this man for his wrongdoings. Pian, are you ready to perform your duty? Yes! Wahid, are you ready for your punishment? Do you have any last wishes? -No! -Do you want to drink? No! -Do you want to eat? -No! Do you want to nap or travel maybe? The time has come. Peace be upon you, Datuk Abang Haji! Peace be upon you, too. Don't stop. -Hi, Abang Haji. -Praise to the Prophet. What brings you here? I… Nothing in particular. Why did you bring him here? We'd like to request help from you. What help? I need your help to defend Lang Buana. No! You're dreaming. We have two different ideologies. You and your people have gone astray. What makes you think that? Aren't we Muslims? No, they're not. I can't sit at the same table with them. Please go. I have unfinished business. But send my regards to your adoptive father, Bercabang. I will send your regards to him, but… I hate to say this, but you're the one who's gone astray. You came here for help, and you dare to lecture me? Muslims must unite. And Muslims must not live their lives in sin. And one Muslim is not superior to another. You check all the boxes for a non-believer. But that's according to you. You just have answers for everything. You were our teacher in Lang Buana. Hence, we know how to answer you. I can't give you my word. I don't feel right helping Lang Buana as it's not within our jurisdiction. Please reconsider, Datuk Abang Haji. After you. -How are you? -Good. How are you, Brother Diponingrat? The lord of lands. The son of Diponegoro. The wealthiest, and the challenger of death. Why do you come here? Have you come from far away? I need to ask for your help. They are going to attack Lang Buana again. I heard that. You have become a stooge of Orang Kaya Sri Bentan. Am I not correct? That was is in the past… Then why do you want to help Lang Buana? Even though all Malaynese are arrogant. Arrogant? But surely not you two. Why should I help an arrogant person? My people are here because we are of one race. But you despise us. How dare you? Surely, there will be disaster. How come? What? Well, I do not know. But our culture is different, and my people were expelled. What have we done wrong? Is it because we are different? Everyone can ask Merewang about it. He knows better. If your wish has been fulfilled, please forgive them. I really need your help. It is not about revenge. Actually, we are friends. We are the same race. That is not my business. Why are you making a fuss about it? Just accept the karma. That was all your own deed. Period. That's it. Please, go ahead. Let's just dance. Let's move forward! We go way back. We were schoolmates. His father was a cigarette merchant who came here to do business. Were you roommates? We slept in a bunk bed. I didn't think he'd turn down our request. What made him so grumpy? What he said is true. We were arrogant when Lang Buana was a strong city. And then we were weakened. There's only one hope left. What do you mean? Kampar. Brother! What do you say, Xin-Xin? Okay, let's go to Kampar. Listen, people. Take out your weapons! Attack! Why did you come here? -How are you, Dad? -I've disowned you! The mountains in Guangzhou were trembling the moment you disobeyed me, your dad! No, I did not, Dad. I just wanted to be… with my lover. And you left the family. You can't possibly love him. He's from another race. But I love him. And… he died serving the country. It's more noble than just making money here and sending it all back to China, who has disregarded us. You're an insolent daughter. You've betrayed the family and rebelled against China! Aren't you aware that you're now in Malay Peninsula? We've left China. We have to serve the country we're in. And we must live in harmony. I came with a proposition. Would you please help us defeat Sang Nira? Please, for my sake. You've betrayed the bloodline. So, I ask you to leave. You and your company. Just go! I'm not turning her away because I'm angry. I'm doing it for Confucius. I feel like bowing down to Sang Nira. No, you can't surrender to him. How can we fight, my lord? It will be a big blow to us. We can still try, Datuk. Yes, we're still trying, but… I'm so embarrassed to Abang Haji, Prince Jawa, and Capitan Wong for asking for their help. My heart aches when I seek the kindness from the people I belittled before. But I set it aside for my people. If that's not enough to redeem me, then I should surrender to him to save my people from death. Datuk. Let him be. Dear… I hate to see him surrender. He can't do that. Aside from worrying about his people, he's also troubled by something. Are you talking about Sang Nira? No. Upon his return to Lang Buana, Ayah Cor claimed the right to rule over the city. And he threatened to destroy the people. To avoid that, Datuk agreed to him. And he handed over the seal to Ayah Cor. But he's a greedy one. He wanted to have my mom, too. But she refused, and father had to protect her. That's when a fight broke out. -Who disturbed me? -What happened? Bercabang. Gunung. Kuih Cakoi? Daik. Gunung. Hey! Kuih Cakoi's here. -What do we do? -Don't worry. I have a new poem. Here goes nothing. No! You and your poems. Remember, we're the warriors of Lang Buana. We will show our strength and bravery. -We will! -We will! We will endure the torture. We will! -You may skin us. -Yes! -You may remove our nails. -Yes! You may fry us. -Yes! -What? We'll endure anything for Lang Buana. -Lang Buana will win. -Yes! -Lang Buana will win! -Lang Buana! Lang Buana will win! Who is he? Defend Lang Buana all you want and you'll feel our wrath. Help! Help me now! Allah the Almighty. Daik! Gunung! Dear! Dear! Where are they? Father. My lords, who did this to you? Dear. -It hurts. -Hurry up. -Help. -Release them. Ladies and gentlemen. On this beautiful night, I urge you to pick me as the General of the Army of Lang Buana. I assure you that every one of you will… Datuk has returned! If Allah wills it. Datuk Merewang is here! Hey! Datuk Merewang has returned! Open the gate. Make way. Coming through. Make way. After you. How are you? You came back early. You're quick on your feet. What? Sir. Hey! -Come here. -What's the matter, Bercabang? Come here. What's the matter? It hurts. Tell me. Did you just come back? It's the Orang Kaya of Sri Bentan. How are you? Good. We're pleased to have you here. Let me introduce you to the lords. They're here to help defend the city. I see. They're the lords. Do you know them? Yes. I know them inside out. Actually, Datuk, we're actually… I blame him, Orang Kaya. He's the mastermind behind our disguise. It's him. Him. -Hey! -What? We're all in this together. Stop pointing fingers. What did he mean by that? Can you explain? Let me tell you. They are… They are the heirs to the throne. And you must obey them. Yes, that's what I've been doing. Wonderful. Now, Datuk Merewang, may I speak with them in private? I have something to discuss with them. -Yes, you may. -Thank you. No problem. Please excuse me, my lords. Kesuma, Xin-Xin, Che Pah, come. Okay, Father. Orang Kaya. You three monkeys. Come here. Now! The city has treasures. I don't mind your disguises. You can be princes, you can be goats, I don't care. But I want the treasure. I had a hard time finding you. I was hanged upside-down. My raft was burned. And I was thrown off. And my Cenuk left me. Hand me the treasures now! But we haven't defeated Sang Nira yet. Datuk Merewang said if we were to-- I don't want to hear that. Can't you see my bodyguards? We see them. On my command… Not yet. They'll kill you in an instant on my command. Can't you wait? It was just a demonstration. I think you should defend the city, too. You can have the treasure if Sang Nira is defeated. It'll be yours. Here's the key. Very well. I accept your proposition. The treasure will be mine. But I still won't let you guys go even if you manage to defeat Sang Nira. Understood? The three stooges will bring Lang Buana shame. I'm just making a living. Where are those who promised to help us, Datuk? If it's just us, we're all doomed. We can try and defend the city. They were the ones that said that we need help. But where is the help? Tell us where! You're nothing but talk! You can't rely on them to lead the army. Kiambang can do a better job! Kiambang! Kiambang! Kiambang… Relax. We will win with grenades. I think we should make some. Grenades, grenades. He's obsessed with grenades. You're right. Can you buy them at a shop? Excuse me, do you sell grenades? I need some. Wrap them nicely or they'll explode. Well, at least it's an idea. Have you come up with anything? So what do you think? Let us make grenades. I have an idea. The enemy's here! Is everyone safe at the mosque? -Yes. -Let's go. Listen, my people. Remember, today we will defend the city. We're free from oppression. True! May it be from within or outside. True! Malays will live! Yes! The Chinese, too! -Yes! -Yes! -May I speak? -You're right. Attack! Take this. Don't give them a chance. Fight them! Take your positions. We're in a battle. We're ready, Bercabang. Malays will never back down. I'm ready to serve, too. That sounds like the title of a song. Ready! Even numbers! -Odd numbers! -Yes! Ready. Aim! Even numbers! Let's pray! O Allah! It almost got me. We're safe. Yes! We're safe! Go on! Odd numbers, attack! What is all this? I have the medals. Relax, Kiambang. We're in a battle. Let me fight them. I'll destroy those grenades. Bring the cannons out! One! Ready? Two! Two! Three! Three! Four! All right! Release! Yes! Bercabang! Gunung! Datuk, look. -We're outnumbered. -There's more! There are too many of them. At least you'll die fighting. But I wish to marry Xin-Xin. My lord, forgive me. Datuk, I'm sorry. Gunung. Relax. Stay cool. You must stay calm to fight the enemy. Only then you can survive a thousand arrows coming at you. Here. Let me show you. Lift him. What happened? Do you think I'm scared? Attack! Datuk, look. Wong Pak Eu is here. Look. Look. Look. There's no God but Allah. Look. There's no God but Allah. There's no God but Allah. They're here for us. Kesuma. My daughter. Kesuma. My daughter. My daughter. My daughter. Allah's Almighty. Attack! Attack. Datuk Merewang! Datuk Merewang! Is he dead? Who will lead us now? Is it me? Father! Datuk! Father, listen. Thank you, Datuk Abang Haji, Diponingrat, Tauke Wong. -You're welcome. -Thank you. It's not too late to make amends. Let us all unite so that we can stand strong as one. You're right. What do you think, Diponingrat? I can't sell my cigarettes anymore if Lang Buana collapses. I think I should go now. People are waiting for my return. You're right. -Thank you. -Thank you. I agree. Life is about sharing. You're right. You share everything. No matter how small. Only then will you be stronger together. We're like bamboo trees that won't get toppled by the strong wind. He's excited. It's Datuk Merewang. Datuk! Thank you. Long live Lang Buana! Thank you, the people of Lang Buana. Thank you all. Now, silence, please. -Long live! -Listen now. Let us all live together in unity from this day forward. Long live! Long live! I'd like to convey my highest gratitude to these three princes. Wait a minute! Who is that? What an ass! You just spoiled the mood. Hear me first, Datuk Merewang! Hear me out! I brought you a piece of news. What is the white man doing here? You must hear him out. Orang Kaya has something to say. Datuk Merewang, I didn't think you'd get fooled by the three stooges. What are you talking about? They are not the heirs to the throne. They are my slaves. You got yourself fooled by my slaves. We knew it from day one, Orang Kaya. What? We knew that they were not princes since the day they set foot here. And we knew that they were just commoners. But we need them for motivation, for us to keep on fighting. And I was right, they did just that. They managed to unite us to deal with the instability in the region. They're more noble than you, who took sides with the colonizer. Don't accuse me blindly, Datuk. We're just friends. Nothing more. Aren't we, my friend? He's lying, Datuk! I overheard their plot to weaken your defense system by letting these three lead your army. That's their plot! Enough, Saga. I may be just a bodyguard to you. I may not be able to contribute much to the country. But I can no longer let those people who stand to gain something belittle the country. Yes! It's time for us to unite! Yes! We must unite to fight foreign influence brought by these two monkeys. Let's drive them out! Drive them out! Get out! No, just stay back. They are troublemakers. No, don't! Wait! Don't go! Wait! Don't go! Wait! Long live the king! Long live the king! Long live the king! Long live the king. Long live the king! Datuk Bendahara. Bring Frank Mocking Power and Orang Kaya of Sri Bentan to me. My lord. Datuk. I'm proud of you. You've saved Lang Buana from the enemy who was your own family. And I'm delighted to see how you've managed to unite everyone during this challenging time. My lord. I couldn't have done all this without the help of three great commoners, who initially didn't plan to make a stop here, my lord. Bring them to me. My lord. My lord. Son. Your mom is worried sick. I will return to her as soon as possible. You fooled us. You're a prince after all. I thought we were friends. Why didn't you tell us? I thought you were a liar, too, like Gunung. I love to travel. Go and see the doctor to get your eye fixed. I will. My lord. Frank. Why do you oppress the Malays? I think we should help each other build the nation together. Because we may need your expertise. So let's work together, Frank. Orang Kaya. I'm grateful to you for your contribution to the development of the trade sector. You have my full support. If there's more like you, the standard of living for the people will get better. Well done, Orang Kaya. But I ask you to stop enslaving people because it's inhumane. Your wish is my command. Lift it. All rise! My lord. Listen. I'm lucky to be the king of a multiracial nation. We must have tolerance and compassion. Long live the king. Long live the king. Long live the king. Long live the king. Long live the king. Long live the king. Long live the king. Long live the king. Long live the king. Long live the king. Long live the king. Long live the king. Long live the king. Long live the king. Long live the king. Long live the king. Subtitle translation by Fida Omar
