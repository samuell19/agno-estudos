It's five past 12 here in mosier, and we're playing the southland's favorite music. This next one, it goes out to the victims of the cheerleader slayings. It's the 10 year anniversary of that terrible tragedy and our little town has not forgotten. Abigail, Maggie, Kat, val, and Dana. We love you and we miss you. To the cheerleaders of mosier high, this one's for you.Yo. To the cheerleaders of mosier high, this one's for you. Oh, you made it! Hi, mom. I missed you. I'm so glad you're here. Oh come in, come in. Come on, we'll get your bags later, come on. I can't believe it. What? Nothing here has changed. Oh please, I've redecorated. Did you see a new rug in the living room? That's new? It looks just like the old one. That's because I bought the same one. I guess I liked it. See, nothing's really changed in 10 years. Is that how long you've been gone? You've barely touched your food. I'm not hungry. I'm just excited you're here. Is that because of the meds? I don't wanna talk about it. Here. Have some more wine. That's why I'm here, isn't it? For the 100th time, I don't need you to take care of me. Okay, I... I'm fine. And besides, chemo appointments are, they're depressing. Well, depressing is my specialty. Well I will take any excuse to keep you here. I think I'll turn in early, it's first day of school tomorrow. I cannot believe you're going back to that place. You know, it's not healthy. You're still traumatized. I am not. Besides, I needed a job and they had an opening. It'll be fine. I'm looking forward to it. All right, well, the first time you feel uncomfortable at all, I want you out of there. Deal? Deal. Yo. What's everyone whispering about? That is Ellie Oliver. The sole survivor of the cheerleader slayings. Interesting. Hello and welcome to ap English. I'm Ms. Oliver and you should all have been emailed a syllabus that... Yes? Is it weird being back here at school? It's great to be back. Now you should all have received a syllabus in your emails detailing what we're going to be looking at. Yes. Dylan. Yes, Dylan? How'd you get that scar? Was it from the attack? What happened? I don't remember the attack. Now, if we could all just stay focused. Does getting stabbed hurt? There will be no more questions about the attack. Okay? Now I have devised a plan to help you thoroughly prepare for your ap test in may. We're going to be looking at Shakespeare. "King lear", "Romeo and Juliet", and "much ado about nothing". Look at Ellie Oliver. No one wants to go near her. Yeah, she's kind of strange. Yeah, I know what you mean. This seat taken? Please, be my guest. Sometimes the teachers can be ruder than the students. Sorry about them. I'm lisbeth. Ap calc. Ellie Oliver, ap English. I know, we went to high school together. -Oh, I'm so sorry. -Oh no, no, no, no. I was pretty quiet back then. So I'd be surprised if you did remember me, frankly. High school's weird. That's an understatement, considering. People are always spreading rumors about what happened that night. Is that forrest? Forrest Parker? Sure is. He dated Kat. He married her twin, Brooke. Really? Kind of creepy, if you ask me. Marrying your dead girlfriend's twin sister, but hey, whatever floats your boat, dude. Watch out for him. He seems to forget he's married. You know, if they'd been triplets, I bet he would've made a play for the last one by now. Ah, the job for which no one clammers. You know, I don't think we've had a cheer coach last a full year since the... Well, you know. Good luck filling that position, lady. Who's up for some chess? Hi honey. So how was your first day at school? Make any friends? Mom, I'm a teacher, not a student. You still need friends. Actually, I did make a friend. And I'm thinking about taking the cheer coach job. Honey, that's, that's crazy. Why would you do that? Why do they even still have a team? Well, if they can't find a coach, then they won't have a team. Besides, maybe it'll be therapeutic. Therapy is therapeutic, not cheerleading. Linda, my favorite patient. How are we today? Doctor, meet my daughter, elliette. You look like you've seen a ghost. I'm not so sure that I haven't seen a ghost. Ellie, is it really you? Jonathan. How are you? I didn't recognize you without your glasses. It's contacts. You two know each other? Yeah, we went to high school together. Jonathan took pictures for the school paper. We all expected you to come back after college. You never did. You two should go out some time, have a drink, catch up. Mom. Well, I'm free tomorrow night. Oh. Well, yeah, okay, I can do that. 7:00 P.M. pub of the north? Sure. I'll see you then. And you, feeling good? Never been better. That's what I love to hear. Ellie Oliver, come on in. Hi, principal Sawyer. Please, you're a teacher now, call me Jill. Jill, it's good to see you. It's good to see you too. You look great. Now, what can I do for you? Actually, I wanted to ask if the cheer coach position was still open? Yes, but... I'll take it! I'll do it. I don't think it's a good idea. I wouldn't wanna put you in a position where you felt uncomfortable. You're not putting me in any position. I wanna do this. Well, I am pretty desperate. I've been supervising practice, which has been a waste of everybody's time. Let me do this. Don't punish the cheerleaders because some monster terrorize the squad 10 years ago. It's not their fault. Okay, let's try it on an interim basis. I'll continue to look for someone else, and we see how you feel. Sounds good? Sounds great. When's next practice? I was just about to head over there. Allow me. It's all you. Where's everyone else? This is it. I mean, people aren't really dying to be on the team. That was a poor choice of words, sorry. Okay, so, small team, that's okay. What are you guys wearing? You can't cheer in those clothes. This is what we always wear. It's fine. Well, from now on, I want you in workout gear, sneakers for god's sakes. You can't do stunts in loose clothing, it's dangerous. Stunts? Right. Sorry. You guys don't do stunts? Okay, so where are we at in competition? We don't compete anymore. We just cheer at games, ever since.... Okay, so it's taking the team some time to get back on their feet. That's understandable. That's one way to put it. Let's just focus on our routine for Friday's game. I was thinking I would teach you guys one of my old favorites. Seriously? We already have a routine. What's the deal with you guys? Do you even wanna be here? Not... No. We just needed something to put on our college resumes. We don't do sports or theater so this is what was left. We usually just hang out for an hour and then bounce. So, can we just do that? Principal Sawyer was okay with that? It's not like she knows how the hell to cheer. Well, I do know how to cheer, so no, we're not just going to hang out and then bounce. Today you're going to learn a stunt. Seriously? Seriously. I'm guessing I'm the poor soul who has to go in the air? Yes, you're tiny. Stand over there. You two can base, you'll spot. Come on, let's go. Whatever. So, cheer coach. Wow. You're brave. Yeah, I mean the hardest part so far has been getting them to actually care about cheerleading. Well still, after what you went through... I've been running from my past for 10 years. Gotta face those demons at some point. I like that. To facing demons. Cheers. Can I, can I tell you something really embarrassing? Now you have to. High school me would be pretty impressed that I got Ellie Oliver out for a drink with me. Really? Yeah. I had the biggest crush on you. No way! Why didn't you ever say anything? I think I tried to, it just, it always came out as a joke. Yeah, I had no idea. Wait, didn't you dump a soda on me once? Yup. Yeah, that was, that was me. I think that was my way of like flirting. My god, I was a moron. No, you were cute. I thought you were cute. I wish I knew. Really? Yeah. Um... But I should get going. It's 7:00 A.M. first period, so. Yeah, I have rounds early too. We should do this again sometime. How about Wednesday night? Okay. Come on, I'll walk you out. He's so cute. Back up! Go far! Back up, come on, back up! How long is that throw? Come on, back up you freaking nerd. Give me a few steps, come on! Did you put my old pompom on my desk and my cheer photo? What, no, I haven't even been in your room since you've been home. Okay. It's just, I swear, I put them in my dresser. You feeling okay? Anything wrong? Have you seen my phone? I can't find it anywhere. No. I haven't, sorry. Strange, I swear I remember plugging it in by my bed last night. Okay, I am worried about you. I mean the stress of being back at school, being cheer coach? I think you should think about seeing a therapist. Loses phone once, mother suggests therapy. You know this is not about the phone. I've tried therapy, it's not for me. You went twice, you said nothing. Look, I have been waiting for the right time. I found a different therapist. One who specializes in trauma. Mom. Please, just take it. I'm fine. Okay, I'm sure I just misremembered. Yeah. But thanks. I gotta go. You haven't even eaten breakfast. Yeah, I'm gonna get in a run before class. Ellie! He's back. No, no one's back sweetie. It was, it was just a practical joke, Brittany's okay. This can't be happening again. Oh god it can't, no not again. It's okay, it's okay. She's unconscious, but she's alive. No, you don't understand, the way she was tied up, the writing, it's exactly the same as last time. -It's the same! -Shh. It's okay. It's okay, it was a copycat. It was a prank. It was a stupid insensitive high school prank. At this time we do not believe the killer's back. The student in question will be fine. Writing was done in pig's blood. We believe this was a sick senior prank enacted by an extremely disturbed individual in exceedingly poor taste. There will be severe consequences once the perpetrator, or perpetrators, are discovered, including criminal charges. And expulsion. Man, I knew teenagers were ruthless, but what kind of sick freak recreates a murder scene? There's no way this was a prank. It was the killer, I know it. It's because I'm back in town. I need to remember my attack. I must've seen his face. Hey, go easy on yourself, okay. I don't think there's a way you can just magically remember something you've buried down that deep. Maybe there is. That's me. Welcome elliette, I'm Dr. Whiting, but you can call me brigid. Nice to meet you brigid. I'm a little nervous. There's no need to be. You went through a pretty traumatic attack. That must've been incredibly frightening. Well, that's the thing, I can't actually remember it. It's called dissociative amnesia. Your brain is trying to protect you from reliving the trauma of that night. Yeah, but if I could just remember what happened, then maybe it would offer some clue as to who the killer was. Maybe, maybe I saw their face. We're not here to be detectives, we're here to help you recover. Don't you think finding the killer would help with that? Why don't you start by telling me what you do remember about that night? I was walking to the parking lot with some of my teammates after the football game, and we'd been partying under the bleachers with some of the guys. Cat and val had been partying, I'd been worrying mostly. Why are you guys still here? Everybody else has gone. We need to go now. Oh, come on Ellie. We had some fun. How can you be drinking right now? Our teammates are dead. That's why I'm drinking Ellie. Sorry, I don't have your a-plus coping skills. It's dark, we shouldn't be here. And that's all I remember. Although I have been having some weird dreams lately. Is there anything you can do to help me retrieve the memory? There are some treatments we could try. Guided imagery therapy comes to mind. What's that? We would immerse you in images and objects from the night you were attacked. More of the memory could return. In fact, that may be why you're having some of those dreams you mentioned. The memory could be returning on its own now that you're back in town and you're surrounded by reminders of your past. If we decide to go this route, I would need you to commit to deeper therapy work, because retrieving the memory is only half the battle. The other half is dealing with what you find. I will. Yeah, of course, this is, this is what I want. The next time you come bring an object from that night. Your cheer uniform, perhaps. It was covered in blood. They took it for evidence. It's okay, anything will work. In the meantime you might try journaling. Journaling? Like in a diary? Most people find that writing down their thoughts helps make sense of them. I'm not much of a writer. Don't worry, you'll be the only one who reads it. You're really convinced it's the killer, huh? I know it is. I'm sure it was just a prank. You know, with the 10 year anniversary coming up at all. How can we get your mind off of it? I think you'd have to sedate me. Well hey, how about this? What are you doing Friday night? Brooke and forrest, they're throwing a party. It's a 10 year reunion of sorts, unofficially. You're friends with Brooke and forrest? Yeah. Brooke's an old family friend and forrest, well, he's a bit of a Chad, but whatever. A Chad? You know, big beefy guy, gets lots of girls. Not a whole lot going on upstairs Chad, okay. I've never heard that. I'd go, but Friday night football game. I'm cheer coach, remember? Right. Darn. That's okay. I'm not really in the mood for a party anyway. But thank you for meeting me. It's nice to have someone to talk to who was there during, you know. Of course. Brittany! Brittany! Brittany! Brittany! Oh, she's back. Oh my gosh, I'm so glad you're okay! Do you remember anything? One minute i'm sleeping in my bed, the next I wake up and i'm hanging from the grand stands. I bet this is Dylan's idea of a senior prank. He's such a turd. Excuse me. That turd is my boyfriend. Sorry. And what makes you so sure that this is a prank anyway? What if it's the real killer back for the 10 year anniversary? Why is Brittany alive then? Maybe the guy messed up. And maybe the next girl won't be so lucky. Who was the second victim? Beats me. After the first murder, they put a major lockdown on the press. So it's really hard to find any information about the others. Trust me, I've looked. Maybe Ms. Oliver will tell US? Fat chance. She shut me and Dylan down hard. We have a right to know what we're up against. Wait, I know who will tell US. Come on, let's go. Hey Mr. Parker. Chloe, Brittany, pippa. Ava? Ava. What can I do for you ladies? We're just really scared after what happened to Brittany. No one will tell US how all those girls died. We're going crazy just imagining all the terrible things that could have happened. Well, I'm sure you girls don't want to know all the gruesome details. You know, everyone treats US like we're children, and we're basically like adults. You know, I did just turn 18 last week. Don't you think that's old enough to know what I want? Of course it is. I just don't wanna scare you was all. Well, we do have you here to comfort US. Right? You do know what happened? Fine. I'll show you, but you didn't see any of this from me. All right? Okay? This was Abigail. She was hung up like you Brittany, except dead. This was Maggie. She was found three days after she went missing, stuffed in a locker, dead. Another girl went missing too, Dana. They never found her. Presumed to be dead. And this is, um, this was... Cat, my girlfriend and her friend val. They were stabbed along with their coach who saw her. The attack she can't remember. Yeah. The next attacks were just more of the same. I think we've seen enough. Are you sure? There's like four more. I think I'm gonna be sick. Why would you show US these? Because you asked me to! Go on. New uniforms. Go on, try them on. Okay, what is the deal with you guys? You really think we wanna identify ourselves as cheerleaders right now? Do you know how hard I had to push principals Sawyer for these? They're top of the line. Not happening, sorry coach. Okay, look, you only have to wear them on game days, and, besides, nothing bad is going to happen as long as you stick together. How'd that work for you and your friends? How about we work on a new routine? Maybe that'll be a good distraction. Screw that, we just came to tell you that we're quitting the team. This is so not worth it. Seriously? You too pippa? I think I'll try my hand at theater. Sorry, coach. You're not scared? A little, but I kinda wanna see what happens next. Well, I release you. You can't you're on your own. Whatever. Elliette. What are you doing here? I'm here for my appointment. I found my spare cheerleading uniform. I thought it might help. I know I'm a little early. I don't think I have you in the books for today. Really? Let's see. No, uh-uh. I swear I made an appointment last time I was here. It's not a big deal. Are you all right? Yeah, no, I've just been feeling really scatterbrained recently. Like misplacing things, doing things I don't remember and not doing things I do remember. I lost my phone. You have post traumatic stress syndrome. Your brain is under a great deal of stress, and especially now with you being back in town, so give yourself a break, okay? Now unfortunately, I have another session but I could see you Wednesday 3:00 P.M.? Is that the soonest that you have? I'm sorry. Have you been journaling? I've been meaning to. Try it, and take care of yourself. Alright, let's give this a try. I feel... I feel silly. Okay, dear diary. This is pointless. I can't believe forrest asked Kat to be his girlfriend. Seems like he's been with every girl on the team, except me, obviously. Maybe I should get contacts. I can't believe had a crush on that creep. I mean yeah, sure, if you want to. Why not? Where do you wanna go? Why Ellie, why? Two Mary 125 to. What makes you think someone broke in? I saw a shadow. I mean, someone was sneaking around the house, the door was wide open. I mean, it's pretty windy outside. It could have blown open? Okay, no, this is not the first time. Okay, the other night, someone broke into the house and moved stuff around in my room. This pompom and the photo, I put them in my dresser and the next morning they were out on my nightstand. Okay. Is there anything missing? Yes, actually my phone, it went missing the same night. That phone? Well I didn't, I didn't see this there. How did it? Is it possible you could have put it there and just forgot it? I don't think so. But I've been getting a little bit confused lately. So you're having memory problems? Yes, but my therapist says that it's totally normal. It's just post traumatic stress syndrome. So you're seeing a therapist? Yes. Get some rest, okay. Call US if you have any other problems. You might wanna think about getting that door fixed. I'm sorry. You're in big trouble young lady. Sorry teacher. Hey, what do you say we make this official? What do you mean? Come on, you've been hitting on me for weeks. Let's meet up. Just name the time and place. Sunday night, look out point. Okay, can't wait. Oh, and hey, keep this between US okay. Well duh. See ya. Knock, knock? Hey Liz, what's up? I heard about the cheer mutiny. You okay? Ah, it's fine. At least I don't have to pretend to like football anymore. Plus my Friday nights just opened up. Well, I have big plans of Indian food and old movies if you wanna join? Actually, I was thinking about going to the reunion at Brooke and forrest's tonight. Did you wanna go? There's a reunion at Brooke and forrest's tonight? I guess that's another thing I wasn't invited to. No, come with me. I don't know. I'd feel like a crasher. I wasn't invited either. Come with me, please? Don't make me go by myself. I'll drive. I'll pick you up. Fine, but only because you're begging and it's pathetic. Text me your address and I'll get you at seven. Sounds good. What are your reading? Ew! Are those school records? Yeah, about the slayings. How did you even get those? The library. It's amazing what the words "it's for a report" will do. You wanna... No, no way. Are you trying to give me nightmares? See you later. Wait, are you going to the game tonight? Yeah, just getting a ride with Chloe. All right, well I'll see you there. Hey, I gotta go too babe. Meet you at the game? We're not going together? I got some stuff I gotta do. Like what? Wouldn't you like to know? What does that even mean? Dylan! Dylan! Ugh! It's a good turnout. Everyone's gonna hit on you. Maybe they'll hit on you. No, it's amazing how you can still feel so invisible around the popular kids, even though high school ended 10 years ago. Ellie, you made it! Jonathan, hey! You remember lisbeth, right? Yeah. Hey. Oh, we actually, we dated for a little bit. I wouldn't say we dated, we went out like once. Really, I didn't know? It was a few times. Well, I mean yeah, but we were like friends, right? You look incredible. Thanks, you look good too. You look great too. Thanks. So what are we drinking? Come on. Who do you keep texting? No one. Are you guys sure pippa wasn't home? I told you we ring the doorbell like three times. Maybe she just didn't wanna come. She always comes to the games. I'm sure that she'll show soon. Here, you need it. No thanks. Hey, how's it going? Where have you been? I told you I had a thing. What kind of thing? I don't know, just something I had to take care of. Well, have you seen pippa? No. Why would I have seen pippa? So weird. You know what, I'll find her myself. What'd I say? Who do you keep texting? No one. People keep asking me for directions. You look great, honey. Why Ellie, why? Why don't you take a picture, it'll last longer? Brooke. Hi. Hi. How have you been? Okay. You? Okay. What happened that night, Ellie? What? What happened to my sister? You know I don't remember. Why are you the only cheerleader that didn't die? Why do you get to live? Did you... Did you have something to do with it all? What? Of course not. Why was her blood all over you then, Ellie? Her blood was all over me? No, no one ever told me that. Look, pippa, I've been trying to call you, so please just call me. What the hell? Pippa? What happened? I saw a mask, a black mask. It was only for a second, and next thing I knew I was in the locker tied up, just covered in pig's blood or something. It's just like before. Where are your parents? They're on their way. I'm a doctor. Can I take a look at her? Ms. Oliver, I need to talk with you. Does this hurt? Okay. - This way. - Can you make a fist for me? Ow. Is this pompom yours? Looks just like the one we saw at your house the other day. Yeah, yeah, that's mine but... Why was it taped to pippa's hands? I have no idea. I threw that out. I mean, I, maybe someone stole it from the trashcan. Where were you this afternoon? I was at school and then I went home and I took a nap and then I picked up miss trudel and went to a party at forrest Parker's house. Can someone confirm what time you went home from school? No, my mom was at work. Where were you the night Brittany was attacked? That was late, I guess I was at home sleeping. If I did it, why would I tie my own pompom to her hand? I don't know, why would you? After the original attacks, we tested the blood on your uniform. Kat's blood was all over it. Oh, so, so now I'm the killer? I killed my friends? No, I can't, I can't believe this. I got stabbed too! That's why we dismissed it at the time, but now I'm not so sure. It wouldn't be the first time someone cut themselves. Trying to throw US off the track. This is crazy. I would never cut myself and I would never hurt anybody! All right, then I'm sure you wouldn't mind cooperating by handing over your phone so we can analyze your location data. I don't have it. I lost it, again. How convenient. Do I need a lawyer? Another cheerleader was attacked over the weekend and the sheriff announced he is narrowing in on a suspect. Is it the original killer back to torment the town or are these copycat attacks? A mosier high school student having some dangerous fun at the town's expense? Only time will tell. I remember when our senior pranks involved tp'ing Sawyer's car. I guess times have changed? By the way, I found this in the parking lot. It's yours, right? I mean you're in the background photo. So I figured. It was in the parking lot? Yeah. Are you sure you wanna do this? Yes, more than ever. I have to know what happened. Is the uniform in there? Sit back, relax. Remember what it was like to be in that uniform, to be a cheerleader. Remember the smells from the concession stand at the football game. The sounds of the crowd. It might help to lie down. Now, tell me again, what happened that night? We were walking to our cars. Kat had been drinking. How can you be drinking right now? A teenager's dead. That's why I'm drinking Ellie. Sorry, I don't have your a-plus coping skills. Let's just hurry, it's dark. We shouldn't be here. Come on val, we're going to forrest's, I'll drive. You can't drive, you're wasted. Let me take you home. No, leave me alone! -Kat, come on! -No! -Give me your keys! -No! -Give them to me! -Get off me! Give them back! Give them back! I fought with Kat. It sounds like you were trying to protect Kat. Why can't I remember what happened? Why am I still here? Why am I the only one who didn't... Who didn't die? You have survivor's guilt. It's a common symptom of post traumatic stress disorder. Okay, can we just, can we try again? I think that's enough for today. I don't wanna push you too hard. Let's try again next week. No, I can't wait another week. I'm sorry, Ellie. We can't risk it. I'm gonna go to the mall after school, wanna come? Hey Chloe. We'll talk about it later. Okay. Yes, Mr. Parker? Where were you last night? We were supposed to meet up. Was that last night? Sorry, it's hard to keep track of my social calendar. Chloe, your grade in my class has been suffering, so I need to know, are we gonna do this or not? Yeah, yeah, we're gonna do this. I told you I just forgot. Okay, tonight my house. Brooke's out of town. I'll text you the address. Tonight? Is that a problem? No, no, can't wait. Okay. See ya. Come on, just do it you baby. Oh no. Hi, look what I found. Where was it? In the laundry room, under some dirty clothes. You're kidding. How did it get there? Maybe you just left it in your jeans pocket. Look, I don't have to go to this conference. No, mom, it's okay. You know, with everything going on, I just... Mom, it's your job. Okay, just go, I'll be fine. Really. I love you mom. Love you too. Goodbye. What the hell? Hey, what's going on? You're not gonna believe this. Come on. It's terrible. I can't believe Chloe's missing. It's okay. It's okay, we're gonna find her, okay. We were okay and she will be too. You guys weren't gone this long. -Ow! -Moron. Guys, think about it. It's just like the slayings. The third girl went missing and was never found, remember? Who would do something like this? I might have an idea. Forrest Parker, a physical education teacher at mosier high school was arrested today for the disappearance of Chloe Carter. Police are unsure if this is tied to the recent attacks on cheerleaders, or if it's an unrelated incident. The search for the missing girl continues. It wasn't me! I didn't do anything! I'm innocent, I swear! I'm their teacher! Hey! You okay? What do you mean? You know I don't think you had anything to do with all of this, right? I mean, they can't even prove that it was your pompom. Wait, you know about that? Everybody knows about that. But I'm sure forrest is their guy right? I mean, he must have stolen it. Right. I just want you to be okay. Your friendship means a lot to me. Your friendship means a lot to me too. Actually, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about. What's up? I know it's stupid, but the whole Jonathan thing, I had no idea you two dated. Oh, that. No, it's, it's fine. Really. I'm used to getting friend-zoned. Really, because I don't have to keep seeing him. I can call it off. You'd do that for me? If that's what you wanted, yeah. Friends come first. Always. I didn't even know that was a thing people did. That would be crazy of me, Ellie. Really? Of course. I just want you to be happy. I...never thought I would be friends with a cheerleader. And you know, I tried out for the squad freshman year. I was a good dancer, but I guess I didn't have the right look. I practically got laughed out of the building. Oh, I'm sorry, that's so mean. Yeah. I held a pretty big grudge for awhile, and I thought all cheerleaders were just a bunch of evil bitches, until I met you. Oh. So thank you. See you later? Yeah. Forest Parker was released earlier due to insufficient evidence. Though it is confirmed that he had an illicit relationship with the student in question. Police could find nothing explicitly tying him to her disappearance or the earlier cheerleader attacked. He remains a person of interest. I told you I was innocent. Great. We're just releasing criminals into the streets now. We're still no closer to finding Chloe. This means the police are gonna be back on your case. Aren't you worried? I have nothing to hide. In fact, I just gave the sheriff my phone so he could analyze it. Are you sure that's such a good idea Ellie? Maybe you should get a lawyer. Guilty people get lawyers. And besides I need to focus on finding the killer, who I think also to Chloe. But I need your help. Anything. You were the school photographer, right? Yeah. Okay, so do you still have any old photos, yearbooks? Anything from our high school days? More wine? Nah, I'm okay, thanks. Thanks again for bringing these. I got rid of pretty much everything I own that reminds me of high school. Of course. Hopefully something in here triggers your memory. Yeah, Chloe's life may depend on it. These aren't triggering anything. Huh. You uh... You took a lot of me. Like I said, I had a crush. Is that a journal? Ugh, yeah, my therapist makes me do it. I kinda hate it. I love journaling. I think everyone should journal. You do not journal. I do too. What do you journal about? I don't know, um... Work stress, my family. Definitely not you. Oh, no? No. Not one sentence. And certainly not entire passages. Oh, well good, because, um, I don't journal about about you either. Good. I'd kiss you, but I know you have serious business to attend to. I have to work anyways. I'm sorry, I'm covering for someone tonight. Yeah. But call me if you need anything, okay. And I'll keep digging around my place, see if I can find more photos for you. Thank you Jonathan, I really appreciate it. Ellie, I know you're worried about Chloe, but you need to look out for herself too, okay? You're sweet to worry. Thank you. Yeah, bye. Bye. Give them back! Give them back! You're just jealous we're going to forrest's house! Admit it Ellie! You hate that he doesn't want you! Shut up! Shut up! Everyone knows you're in love with him Ellie! Everyone knows he'd never date a loser like you! I hate you! Why Ellie? Why? Can you hear me? Ma'am, we have your location, we're sending units now. Hi, have you seen Dr. Colton? No. Is Dr. Colton in? Have you seen him? No, I'm sorry. Okay. I need to see Dr. whiting, right now. Elliette? What are you doing here? I need to talk to you. It's an emergency. Okay, my next session is about to start and frankly I'm surprised to see you here. What do you mean? The email you sent me last night. You told me you wouldn't be coming to therapy anymore. Wait, no. I sent you an email last night? You don't remember? Yeah, that's my email, but I really don't remember sending that. It's possible you did it in your sleep. Have you been doing anything else weird in your sleep? I um... I have to get out of here. Ellie, are you okay? Yeah, I'll be fine. Jonathon, thank god. Yeah, my office said you were looking for me. Yeah, can you meet me at my house, please? There's there's writing everywhere and I don't know what to do. Okay, I was just about to head home. I'll come right over. Okay. Something happened last night. What's going on? No, you need to see it. There's writing everywhere, and the picture...Just, come. See. Look. Yeah here. Oh my god. Did you do this, elliette? What? No. What is that? This is Chloe's headband. Why do you have Chloe's headband? Okay. It wasn't me. Okay, it wasn't. We have to go to the police. What if you're having some kind of breakdown? You're you're doing this in your sleep. What? No, no, it's not me! -He's framing me! -How do you know it's a he? It could be a woman. It could be you, Ellie. What? No, I would never! And I can't name a single woman who would wanna murder a bunch of... Oh my god. What? -I know who it was. -Who? Just, just wait here, I'll explain everything. Where are you going? To prove it wasn't me. Ellie, where have you been? You missed a whole day of classes! It was an emergency, I'm sorry. Is everything okay? Lisbeth? There's a chance she's being framed, right? That she didn't do this. It doesn't look good. What's this? Some kind of diary. Talk to me. Oliver's phone was at the scene of every one of the attacks. Got it. No question about it. Copy that. That was mobile forensics. Ms. Oliver's phone was at the scene of all the recent attacks. We got our girl. Get an apb out on elliette Oliver, stat. Wait, what, you're arresting her? You don't even know that she did this! Sorry Jonathan, we're gonna need you to go home, now. Ms. Oliver, are you okay? You've reached Dr. Colton, leave a message. Jonathan it's lisbeth. The killer is lisbeth, I have evidence! I'm coming over! We have breaking news on a local story, school teacher elliette Oliver, the sole survivor of the cheerleader slayings, is now wanted in connection with the disappearance of mosier high school student Chloe Carter, who went missing two nights ag. -Holy... -Miss Oliver is believed to be on the run from authorities. Dylan, I found Ms. Oliver. Jonathon! -Meet me at 11 dory Lane. -Jonathon! I think Chloe's here. Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan! The killer is lisbeth, I have proof! You've gotta see this! Why Ellie, why? What did I do? Ellie! The police are looking for you. It was you. What are you talking about? You're the killer. You finally remembered. It took you long enough. Seems I was way more worried about that than I needed to be. You have a terrible memory. You're deranged! Yeah, well, I'm not the one seeing a therapist, am I? Boo! You scared me. I'm sorry, babe. Look, it's okay though, I brought reinforcements. Okay, so what's your plan here exactly? Take down Ms. Oliver, ourselves? If we have to. Do you really think she did it? I don't know, but we have to try to find Chloe, so... Yeah. Let's go. Took you forever to get here. I drove the speed limit babe. Shut up. Would you look at who's finally awake? Why did you do it? Why did you kill them all? Why? Maybe I should ask you why? Why is it, that bitches like you always think you're better than everyone? Huh? You prance around in your slutty little uniforms waiting for someone to ask you out, and then when they finally do, you laugh at them. Unless they're a Chad, like forrest. Are you talking about me? You've never even asked me out. Yes I did, several times. And you laughed at me. No, that's not true! You thought it was a joke. All of you cheerleaders did. Hilarious Jonathan, with his funny jokes. I'm sorry if I offended you. Offended me? You ridiculed me. You laughed at me with your friends. No, we thought we were laughing with you. Okay, we loved you. We thought you were a great guy. Oh please! I never stood a chance. You friend-zoned me from the start. Oh, like you friend-zoned lisbeth? You women are all the same. You only want ... like forrest, not the nice guys like me. Right. Don't laugh at me! Doesn't look like anybody's here. No, there is. I saw her come around this way. Seriously? What the hell are you doing? I'm going inside. You guys can do what you wanna do. I really hope we don't get arrested, or worse. Why didn't you just kill me when I came back to town? Hm? And why did you let these girls live? Because I realized something. Torturing you was way more fun than killing anyone. Your fear over the return of the killer, convincing you that you might be the murderer, and now the police are on their way to come and arrest you. Oh, it is so, so satisfying. It was you. All of it. The pompom, the writing on the wall, the diary. You should never leave your drink unattended, Ellie. Every girl knows that. You drugged me. I gave you good stuff too. The police have your confession, multiple pieces of evidence. And now that they have your phone, they see that you were at the scene of all the recent attacks. But I wasn't. But your phone was. Of course. You've been stealing my phone too. You should really lock your doors at night, Ellie. There's a murderer on the loose. Chloe! Oh my god! Chloe, are you all right? Did Ms. Oliver do this to you? No, it was the guy. Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, the guy upstairs. He told me that if I misbehave, I'd end up in the closet, with the other one. The other one? Come on. -What? -Get up. It's the missing cheerleader. Guys. Shh, come on, let's go upstairs. What? You're not gonna get away with this. Okay, I'll tell them that it was you. You think they'll believe you? I'm a respected oncologist, Ellie. And you, well, you have a documented history of mental illness. Even your therapist can confirm that you've been acting strangely. Writing emails in your sleep? Your laptop was wide open, I just couldn't help myself. So you framed me? You drugged me and you planted Chloe's headband in my room? You just made it so easy. I just have one question for you. What's that? I didn't reject you this time. You had me. So if you wanted me this badly all this time, then why are you still doing this to me? You know, I thought I wanted you, but I realized, the truth is, I hate you. You and all the girls just like you. I can't think of anything better than seeing you rot in prison for a bunch of murders that you didn't commit. It's brilliant. I frame you for everything, and then I never get caught. You're right. It is brilliant. Thank you. But there's just one small problem with your plan. What's that? You just confessed it to the whole world. What? Ms. Oliver! Ava! Oh my god. How did you know I was here? It's a long story. You don't even wanna know. Ava, for once, I am incredibly glad that you are nosy as hell. In other news, serial killer Jonathan Colton was sentenced today to life in prison without parole. In a fitting end to mosier's town tragedy, it was the cheerleaders themselves who took down the once esteemed doctor who'll now spend the rest of his life behind bars. Said one relieved resident, "we finally feel safe here in mosier, after 10 long years." Hey mom. Hi honey. Come on up. What's all this, then? Well, have a seat. I have some exciting news. What? The doctor called, I'm in remission. Oh mom! I know. Oh, this is just the best news ever. I know. Oh, well we have to toast. Okay. To kicking cancer's butt. Screw cancer! I hope this means you're not gonna be leaving US again. I just really love having you here. Are you kidding? I can't leave, I have a cheer tournament to win. Well, let's toast to the cheer tournament. -Cheers. -Cheers. Our last practice before our first competition! You guys ready to kill it out there? Coach trudel, would you cue the music? You got it, coach Oliver! Mosier high school, the yellow, black, and white, come on all you wildcats, let's fight, fight, fight, fight! Mosier high school, the yellow, black, and white, come on all you wildcats, let's fight, fight, fight, fight!
