The dead don't dance, what the hell! Did you know that Cain was from Renteria? If you get annoyed, I'll fire you! Don't frighten anyone with this face, my friend. But with that hand, I respect everyone. Put one more and we won't talk anymore. Good ? - All right. - That's it, I like to drink. I'm laughing at Antonio's lack of humor. He always tells us the same thing. Always the same story of a doctor from Zaragoza which he told his patient, "Your duty is to die, and mine is to watch the bullfights." Hurry up and be beautiful. I'm tired. Take these up, there's a lot of work here! Mom, wake up. You have to eat, that's what the doctor said. It's the food you like. Bring me a glass of water. Here you go. Make an effort. Do you want me to feed you? Not. Chiqui, less, chubby. Do you realize that it has even changed its appearance? What do you care about, right? Find out that the same thing happens with bitches . Leave her alone ! He never loved you. I have to go down. Do you need anything else ? Hi... The only man in one piece. Ca Otello. Serve my friend and me, sweetheart. - I'm honored. - Your black balls! - This is for you. - For what ? - Because you're beautiful. - And you're a braggart. - Are you satisfied? "Very pleased." Rocio, come here! Long live Spain! These gentlemen want to know if you have a fiancé. "Who cares about that?" - Me, for example. I have a lot like you ... but you can come and sweep in the morning. It's just like his father. THE WHITE PALOMA - I'm hungry. - Can I put a patch on you? No, better without. It will dry out. Then it's ready. And now, at the table! Get this out of here, it smells like medicine! - They have to be put somewhere. - Not here. I'm having breakfast. - My back is turned upside down - Don't talk like that, you curse yourself. Dã-mi o aspirinã. Mario, son ... enough misfortune has befallen us. They should all be killed! God forgive me. - Are you coming for lunch? - I've got work to do. Here! - The calculation is not good, as usual. "When did you learn to gather?" Before you were born, to my misfortune. Two more, Mario. Ine. Is that okay? - You're not a good accountant. - Stop the nonsense, Jon. Good luck! I don't know this route. Tell me where to get it. At first, turn right. There we have two stops. After that, we have five more stops on the other side. I like it, fast and clear. That's why I first notify you when we have more to transport. - How's your head? - Stupid, it still hurts a little. If we finish quickly, we'll have a glass of wine, okay? It's done. Turn left. Two! - Where do I put them? - Leave them there. Wait, not there! You better put them here. I ordered two weeks ago. I also told you it was a strike. Until I signed a new agreement, God was not served either. Customers kept asking us. It's the company's fault. It may be, but we're tired of it We're tired of it. Let's go, Mario! She's in a bad mood. - You want something ? - Not Then hurry up, or take it in stride. This girl is getting me out of the watermelon! Fir-ar sã fie! - Did you hear what I said? - Yes I heard... Look who's coming! How are you beautiful ? - And you, Mario, where did you go? - I carried. Good luck! Isn't there a place for me too? This is a men's thing. For men, of course ... As was the case yesterday. If it weren't for that, I'd be beating myself up. What was I to do? Do I do kamikaze? - I knew you could handle it. - No, you're a great guy. Look, Mario. If you're upset, you know why. "Don't mess with me like that." "Why don't you drop it?" - I already left her. - But I do not... I thought you were cultivating mallow. - How many were arrested? - Many. I think Mikel and Bellota are among them. But I don't know anything about Aker "I think he's hunting birds." - I hope so too. I have to decide on Lekeito tomorrow. The Lekeito thing is nonsense. Let's think about something else. It will be decided and a decision will be made. It's just a nightmare ... You had no eyes! I still have them ... Look at them! You've changed a lot. I do not recognize you anymore. When you get better, we'll go to Madrid. - Remember? "Of course I remember." - We were recently married. - You have to get well. Will you help me? Open my drawer. Here you go. - Come down, I'll be right back. - It's not a rush. She's very beautiful, isn't she? She's already a full-fledged woman. Yes, it is true. Bravo ! Shameless ... that's art! I believe you too! - Do you like it? - Is beautiful. Ten old women. I have a truck outside. What do I need your truck for? Make love, idiot. Do you understand? Ten old women to make love in a truck? I'm dust-free. There are other things that might interest me. Ask this one. But be careful, he's aggressive. Rocio, come here. Damn it, look how you look! If you wanted to ... But I do not want. Because I'm fine, aren't I? How's your business, thief? How do you know that? - Aren't you in a good mood? - Not today. What 's wrong with making you look like that to you? Life! Carry on! Get out of here, you bastard! Stop coming here because I'm killing you! You bastard! "Don't come here again, you bastard!" - You hit me hard! Hey, Thomas! - Hello. - What happened ? I just wanted to talk to Saints. Nothing serious. Damn it, boy! Pick a few hours to talk. - You scared me to death. - Sorry. I talked yesterday, I just wanted to talk to him again. It's like you're engaged, boy! What happens ? Aren't you going with Expe today? Yes, but I still have time. Did you see her ? What a wonder! It was brought yesterday by a fox from Neguri. He collects them for his girlfriends to walk around. Every six months it brings us lightning, but that ... Haide... vino... - Where am I taking you? - Everywhere, not just there. I know why you came. Ever since I met you, you've always done the same thing. You shouldn't have said that. What interests you is about Expe. Don't get her in it! What interests me is that there is a rift between us. I was upset, that's all. Mario, we're all in the same boat. - Yes, drifting. "Is that what you think?" Did the death of Andres and the others help you to say that? Forget it quickly. How can I forget? Andres was the only one I had! We have to get to the bottom of it until they go to hell. I loved your brother Andres too. Let him go! - Let's go, it's late. - You just know I'm punctual. - What is this ? - You'll see. - Are they uniforms? - For everyone. Last time he didn't sign the receipt. - Why didn't he want to? - No, I forgot. Yes ... You can find it up there. Give it to me ... Leave it, I'll go. See... What happens ? Do you want to hang it, or what? Are you interested ? "Are you looking for me, handsome man?" - You must sign the invoice. Give it a go! Here. Good. - And now what are you waiting for? - The pen. - I bought it. - It is not for sale. Let her go ! Let her go ! What happens ? Nothing. Go ? Damn it ! We've been lost here all afternoon! Ladies and gentlemen! You bastards! God forbid to enter here either! This damned land is yours! And yours! - Do you pay now or do I write you down? - Write me down. Write me down ... Please ... can you give me a beer? That's it! One two Three... Shoot ! Wow, damn it! Sluggish ! Haide, carry! Domingo, a lemon gin. How are you buddy ? I have a cheap and very nice wristwatch . For your fiancée. I don't have a fiancée. If you don't have a fiancée, look what a beautiful watch for your sister. I don't have a sister either. - Why don't you get out of here? "Don't worry, boy." Today you are really beautiful, little girl. You're lightning fast! You are wonderful, thank you. If you want, go upstairs. I'll stay, okay? Yeah ... I'm a little tired. Did you come without your mother? No, I left her out. Why don't you come and help me get her inside? - I have to stay here. - Give me another one. Do you already want to get rid of it? - When are you telling me? - I'm not a fortune teller. "Mario, traitor, you kept her hidden!" - She's Rocio, and he's Sânţi. - Do you know that you look good? - Others have told me. - Do you know what this is? - What ? - That, what do you see with your big eyes. - Sounds like a party, doesn't it? Besides looking good, she's smart. It's a party, but popular and socialist. You have to share everything. Let's Dance. The girl is with me, don't you see? Why don't you get her out of here? You may have problems. You do not believe ? - Where are you taking me ? - Come over. "Are you cutting me to pieces now?" - Not. - Now ? - Now. Do you have any slippers? My feet hurt. Here they are ! You are well prepared. - In times of war you have to be. "What war are you talking about?" Do you live here and don't you know? Which side are you on? Nowhere. I'm not interested in this war. Whether or not you're interested in war ... you're involved. We are here now. It's the only thing that interests me. Didn't you go to bed? Okay, I'm going to bed. Why are you doing this to me ? I went to a party where I danced and I felt good with other people. - This is what I have done. - You messed up, that's what you did! I'm not your property. You always did whatever you wanted with me. But know that it's over! That's the only thing I understand, is n't it? Tell me you like it. Tell me! - Tell me! - Yes. You are everything to me, my child. I will never leave you. Never. My life ... - I want to die ... - Don't talk like that. - You're not taking me. - Don't start again, Mom. - Are you upset? - Do not enter. - I hope I don't interrupt something important. - Do not enter. I'm getting dressed. I just wanted to know what was going on. You are nowhere to be seen. I don't feel like going out. I spend all my time on TV. - You're upset, aren't you? - No, but I'd rather stay here. It's not good to be locked up. You're in for a treat. Not me. I'm not kidding. With this skin, there is no way! You have fine skin, you know? Almost like a woman. There are men who look like a crumb. You may not think so, but I've met a lot of men You stay with me, don't you? - I grabbed a few. - What a haimana you are! We'll have transportation again in a few days. If necessary, I need the blows. You look fatal! I was cutting this. See ? That makes you look so much more beautiful! - Do you want to make love to me? - It wouldn't work. You're right, but you're the loser. I'll call you about transportation. Rocia ! Rocia, come here! - What do you want now? - I want you. "Drinks make me sick." - Come over... Bring the same for everyone. I'm honored. Lemon gin. "You've had enough!" "It's never enough." - You see it ? "Carry on, Mario!" - I want to be with you ... - I told you to carry you! - How many glasses did he drink? - Five. - Look, boy, I'll invite you to the last one. - Why ? Because I want to be good to you. Do you drink as much as you want, after which you carry, do you understand? No, no ... I'll tell you a secret. No, it's a secret, a top secret. You and I are from the same lands. How do you know? It's the only thing that has to be taken into account, the rest is just rubbish, right? Carry yourself ... I wo n't tell you a second time. No, not before I drink one last rum. A rum. No rum, nothing! Get out of here, my mother! I have the right to stay here as long as he wants! Do you know that? Get out of here, Negro! You bastard, abortionist! Let me go ! Miserable black! Come with Chipiron, you're pretty well fed. Maybe we're lucky. Is "Miss" free? Carã-te ! - Go somewhere else to regulate. - I'm bringing a present. - What game is this? - Aşbă sausage ... Cãrniþã aºbã! - Are you both coming in? - Me first. Wine ! Do you like it, prince? Of course you have no secrets! - How beautiful you are, princess! "Don't hurt me." I like you a lot ! Look, Princess, Idris is alive again! - Where the hell are we going? - Do you like to play? - Can I get you two? - I don't like this shit. Come out ! - Go, he's waiting for you. - No, not at all. Go, wait for you. Hai, prinþeso, haide ! - My sister ? - I think he stayed. Marcel ! Let's see who wins! Good ? We're leaving, boy! Are you coming with us? - Where? Where are you going? - Anywhere. Come with us, boy! "What can I do with you?" - Same thing here. My treasure! I've been to many places and they're all the same. "Are you coming?" - Coming. Don't go back there. The boss is very dangerous. And his daughter ... Don't go near that place anymore. Leave me ... If he finds us? We have to leave. Let's get away from here. - You're crazy! - It's not crazy. - I have to tell you! - Not now. It's impossible now! You're completely crazy. - I'll be waiting for you at six o'clock. - Okay, at six. Don't pull the trigger! "Don't pull the trigger!" - Now go! You scared me ! - You ate ? - After that. Good. - Tremors ... - A little! I'll be back soon. Behave yourself. Do you eat two pieces? Good ! I'll give you two. How are people! Stinginess breaks the bag. How is it ? How pretty she is! She's very nice, I like her. She came out. How cute they are, I like them. You don't look good at all, boy. Don't you have a fever? It seems not... Now eat! After that in bed, you don't get much sleep. Don Fermin is asking me about you. You should go see him, he won't eat you. He behaved so well when the misfortune happened to Andres ... Ce-i cu tine ? Why don't you go make love to that priest? And leave me alone! I'm doing something to you and this disgusting city! And so did that bastard of my father's and my brother's! Mario ! I'm going to split you up, you bastard! Wait a minute. - Let me. - Be careful. Open your hand, let me see. Be patient ... like that. Thanks, Thomas. You've always been a good mechanic. If you don't have someone to take care of your wound, come by, okay? Hold on ... Now you can go. - What will you do ? - It's my business. Now she's everyone. We have to arrange that guy right! Do you know what? Leave me alone ! Don't tell me what to do. Mario, that place is cursed. You're going to lose everything for nonsense! - All right, boy! Mario! Where are you going ? Is the same. No sense in telling you now - I don't wanna ruin the suprise. - Let's go. - Do not touch me ! You're exhausted. Here's how you look ... I'm fine. You heard what the doctor said. We have nothing to do here. I told you not to touch me! - What's with you ? - Nothing, I'm fine. Go, if you want, but I'm not thinking of moving from here. How do I leave? I can't leave you like this. I prefer to be alone. Let's go, honey. Never say that again, never say that again , she knows everything! That's why! That's why he's going to die! He speaks more slowly. No one will die. I don't want to see you again. You hear me ? You will never have me! - Girl ... - Never, never! Go, go ... I told you to go! My life ... I need you. I need you. You will go with me. I will not let you escape me. I can't anymore, she's a scumbag. I hate him with all my heart. - Where is he now? - Look at me ... he has me ... - Where is he now? - In the tavern. He's waiting for me there, but I'm not moving from here. - Do you love me? - Yes. - Say it again. - Yes. We're leaving here. I'll come after you. - When? - Tonight. Tonight ... They won't let you in. I will come !
