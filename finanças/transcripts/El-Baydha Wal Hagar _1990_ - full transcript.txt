I've never heard a journalist say hide and seek and limp pimp I appreciate my peace of mind, I'm not into sleazy pranks Have you ever seen a ghost? I've heard of people who have seen them I challenge you to find anyone who saw, they just heard fibs - It is all superstition - You always argue All religions touched on such issues Religion doesn't say a dead man's soul spooks the living There's a difference between being dead and being murdered If the soul of a murder victim kills me, my soul will kill it back! Cut that out - Are you a musician? - I'm a teacher - What about that lute then? - It is food for the soul Soul! God protect us - Tell me - Yes? - Is the room really haunted? - That's none of my business Don't keep me in the dark Look, my knees are wobbly already You wait and see - Have you seen anything? - It's sunny at night What do you mean? When the moon is in the sky, you find the room sunny So it's sunny in there now? That was long ago, before Zibakh lived there Back then, the walls would ooze with blood Blood? As long as we keep the vow made by Zibakh, it's okay - Vow? - All the neighbors keep it How? Incense burnt and dues paid on time That will prevent the evil, don't worry How relieving! - Goodbye, man - Goodbye A cat jumped in, and back out again, very normal Loud western music, nothing unusual there Don't give in to delusions Being deluded is to stick to a faulty idea He who fears ghosts is bound to see them... I am not scared I am not scared I am not scared What's there to fear? Those who get scared are deceived by their own eyes I am not scared He who fears ghosts is bound to see them They will spook him, drain life out of him No drug for that ailment But I am not scared - Fear is only... - My God! the key to all misfortune Oh, what a mess! What a mess! Auntie! Fear fogs our brains And increases our pains Cast away, evil spirits He's singing to the cat-ghost Ever since I saw him, I knew he was a clone of Zibakh What's there to fear?

In the name of God, what's that? Now that's unusual! - One more blow - Keep your voice down We have to scare him away tonight What more can I do? I'm out of breath Give it another blow, let him get scared, maybe he hasn't felt it yet Give it to me You blow, I'm breathless I don't blow, boy, I pull the strings Well, pull the hose before he finds us - Let's scare him away first - I think he fell asleep Who did it attack this time? If you pull any more cheap tricks, I'll rip your eyes off I will turn you into roaches and squash you Oh, God! Are you one of the masters? If I weren't a master, would I have taken the room, you lame crooks? So you know? I see and hear all I will kill you if you rip off any of the neighbors again We repent, master Forgive us, your holiness Go, go So you are into sleazy pranks?

The people in flat 4 are unhappy with your new prices How am I supposed to fix my washing machine then? - What do I tell them? - That everything's become expensive Why should laundry be cheaper? Maybe cleanliness doesn't matter What a vile language Laundry and pressing go hand in hand, my price is the same as theirs Do you want a quarter of a pound for each shirt, you money-hound? Leave it altogether Let them press their clothes unwashed Like they say: "Don't fancy being clean Walk around stinky and mean!" You animals on the roof! I'll call the police if you don't close the tap They'll pull out that water pump you installed You rogues! Have a heart, sir.

God bless! Tell me, Mr. Whoever-you-are, are you really possessed? Cast away evil spirits What a thing to ask! He's our neighbor, we have to know his flavor I'd love to know your flavor I'm vanilla white, the best around Tarouta is like that, he sweet-talks his customers all the time - Very sweet - Looks like a mean neighbor What's wrong with that man? His mother was dying to have a son To protect him from the evil eye, she dressed him like a girl till he was 9 It's not his fault then Two more years and his body would have developed bends and curves You are hilarious, your holiness Social adaptation is coping with what one has and is present in one's surrounding environment - Question, please - Yes, Dahy If the surrounding environment is corrupt, - how can one cope? - By taking dope! That goes in movies, not in Sociology, idiot! Sit down, Dahy One must use one's brain to defend oneself from corruption How will one's brain defend? It should control your urges and regulate your needs - How to control urges? - By cutting down on things - So, we don't eat? - We eat but sensibly Man is a consumer by nature But if consumption rates surge to the rate of greed then, his life goes berserk He will feel enormous anxiety, conflicts and perversions He will lose his taste for the items he strives for - Excuse me, sir - Yes? Sit down So if there is a plate of beans and platter of salad, do I eat only one? Young man, eat whatever comes in your way.. Hush, boys because you're a good boy Wow! Life is not about stuffing your belly A lot of people die of over eating but no one dies of hunger Are you Ghandi or the authority of malnutrition? - What's going on? - Sales dropped because of you - The school shop will go bankrupt - Thanks to your greed Who said you can sell sandwiches and soda to students- at touristic prices? - What is it to you? - Answer him, boys - This is public exploitation - Dodgy manipulation - Out of reach, out of mind - Is that so? - What do you think? - This is sabotage The principal, who's on the take, will hear about this!

He is a communist, sir - What? - Believe me He spatters and spews.. Spews? Left-winged talk, extra-curricular discussions - What kind of discussions? - Consumption and value - That red communist bogus! - Damn it! A rich man is one who can give up the biggest amount of possessions not one who will buy them Be realistic! What can you give up? Providing essentials is hard enough Alternatives do exist, and life is easy You ride an old bike in the middle of traffic You're a teacher, studying for a Ph.D in philosophy You cheapskate! My bike gets me here before people in cars do So a bike is alternate means of transportation What about your defeater as an alternative to marriage? Both beat the hell out of me You've become the laughing stock of the community - Why, brother? - Damn this brotherhood You've brought shame to the whole family I just thought I'd give you my new address A room up on a roof? Have you forgotten who you are? Let go of your unjustified snobbery All your grandfather left you was a father, and he's dead! Your father died and left you a big house In a slum, built in the 1800's and it collapsed - Where do you want me to live? - You were in a rented flat It became out of reach, so.. You abandoned it. Nonsense! That's as much as I can afford, what should I do? Do like everyone else - Should I become a crook? - That would be more honorable Ma, the good-looking boy is at the door All flashy and shiny Shall I close the door, Ma? Or shall I let him in? Ma, the good-looking boy is at the door I'll close the door. Ladies are everywhere We see a lot on the streets But here, I can zoom in Ma, the pretty girl is at the door Come, defeater! How hard it is to stick to principles these days!

My son is under a magic spell Zibakh is away, he will never be back Where did he go? Tell me, please, where he is - I said I don't know - Why don't you let her go upstairs? - To whom? - To Master Taazy - Where can I find him? - In Zibakh's old room He is a blessed man, he will set you at ease Don't tell him that we sent you - Why not? - He has a few followers only He's very picky, go to him, maybe he'll help Thank you so much - What did you do that for? - Bait, dumbhead Bait? If he falls for it, we'll kick him around like we did with Zibakh And if he doesn't? Then he knows nothing about magic, he's harmless to us Your holiness, please have mercy on me Holiness? I am not into that kind of business For the sake of all the Holy Masters, please help me My only son, the only thing I got from this world... - What's with him? - Spellbound against his wife They've been married for 2 month and nine days, with no intimacy Poor son, he cries all night And she sits there wailing over her bad luck And all I can do is slap myself Your son needs professional help Nothing wrong with his health.

Give me a break I directed them to the causes of frigidity between couples in the same way sorcerers speak and act How do you know how sorcerers act? Hey, I'm wet all over, mind the potatoes! Don't doubt my knowledge again Sorcerers' success depends on two things His self-confidence and how much people believe in him This is not your buisness Why put your nose in such experiences? I won't leave you this time Here.. I'm really concerned and you are interrupting my thoughts Understood The experiences I've studied on the roof since I moved in that room made me change the topic of my thesis So, you're giving Plato the slip?

You are suspended from your job until the investigations are over - Take this - God forbid! I'm not begging Then why did you come to me?

You're a lot better off as you are Hello My late father was a big gardener It shows, he planted a very beautiful trunk God bless you When he got richer, he fell for a playgirl She squandered his money and devastated us My mother couldn't take it and she died of misery And so I left school and worked so as not to starve - That's respectful - But loneliness is ugly My stepmother condemned me to loneliness because I refused to marry her son How did she do that? She cast a spell so I won't marry Don't say that You're very beautiful, any man would love to marry you They make me look like a monkey in the eyes of my suitors! - Who are "they"? - Cast away evil spirits Any suitor either has an accident and runs away from me- - or sees me a monkey - That is nonsense My stepmother, may she burn in hell, cast a spell on a string with multiple knots and buried it under an ant's toenail An ant? And this ant is roaming the earth, nowhere to be found Your holiness, I beseech you, help me I will help you, on one condition Your wish is my command Forget about this ant business, it's nonsense Marriage is a matter of destiny My destiny's under an ant's toenail Your destiny depends on your conduct, the way you behave Men will always run away if you're edgy and tense Will incantations calm me down? - What are you saying? - What do I do then? Highlight your feminine side. Always be soft, gentle and tender Oh, golly! Believe me, the solution is in your own hands You have undone everybody's spells, but not mine?

Madam! I swear that I never ask anyone for anything They give me things to deliver Deliver what? Alms, I deliver them to the mosque - Mosque? - As Zibakh ordered All alms go the mosque How many apartments paid so far? I will show you! Come with me Where to? I'll show you the right place to put the money you collect Move it And these vows state that each apartment must donate a duck? These are offerings, each gives what he can afford Some apartments give us some sugar Others give us tea - And some give you sheep - Sheep? - And turkeys - I hope I choke on them - Be honest - Please don't give me that look - Speak up, Sabbassy - I'll tell you everything, I promise One passenger to Banha Get in quickly, Miss What chaos is this!

On your way, driver, Godspeed One passenger to Banha Kaooda, leave this place and come with me right now - Everything okay? - Everything is great Come, let's carry Zibakh's chest - Carry them where? - To the roof Let's go Here it is, it contains his clothes, books and tools of the trade Open it May the doors of heaven open to you Maybe we'll be prosperous once again Excuse me, but will you make it in this profession? Of course, shall I turn you into a monkey? No, let's stay friends Don't you think he can do what Zibakh did? The look in his eyes makes birds drop dead off the trees Zibakh can't do what I can do, you idiots! Tell me what Zibakh used to do He'd do spells, undo them, and he read palms - Did he read the sea shells? - No, he didn't I will read sea shells, change good wills and make charmed amulets - Charmed amulets? - That'll make the moon stop spinning My, oh my! Great! Send me any customer who asks for Zibakh's services Now we're talking, your holiness - His holiness is here, sir - He is most welcome Hello, please come in This way, sir Please, have a seat What is your problem? Someone stole 4,000 pounds off me, I kept them here, at home I want you to find out which of my three wives took them - Is this true, ladies? - That's bogus - God protect us - Such a tyrant! - Could it be anyone else? - It is one of them The truth will appear, for God is near, may I have a knife? - A knife? - A sharp one, please Here you are, your holiness Each one of you will lick the sharp edge of the knife like this And let it be known to you that the knife of revelation will cut the tongue of the infidel amongst you Lick the knife, Aziza I hope your tongue gets cut off Give me the knife, you slanderer God has revealed your innocence Your turn, madam No way! I will never lick a knife, forget it! What are you afraid of? You took the money, you thief! Yes, I took it and you won't get a penny back - The truth has appeared - God is great! Now I eat three meals a day, for free! Blast you! You are a demon You haven't seen anything yet - What's next? - The game is just starting How? If I am not Zibakh, I must become Zibakh Damn you I will juggle eggs and rocks - You'll become a trickster? - Who isn't a trickster these days? Zibakh has his own tools Magic is an intelligent manipulation of the hopes of people But there are rules you know nothing about I learned metaphysics and mathematical logic and the methodology for seeking truth I can surely learn about conjuring and witchcraft - Witchcraft? - Or sorcery As Ibn Khaldun called it in his book, idiot What's wrong with you? Are you out of your mind? "Woe to the world if the learned live perversely" We were young, now we're old Go away, old age, and bring back the golden age Let's jump and jump From one city to another We were young, now we're old Jump up and down, soar like a rocket Luck is on your side Burn the old man in you and bring out the fiery flirt His youth Will make one powerless We were young, now we're old Don't worry, this sheikh is really good, he will undo the spell I hope he unwinds his soul altogether How could you speak like that about your husband! What kind of a husband is he, Ma? Who else would agree to marry you and support your kids? - Man in hand better than ten on a tree - I told you, he isn't a man His first wife has him spellbound, we are undoing him Now have some shame and stop being such a lust-hound Oh, dear! It looks like he kicked the bucket! You fool He's been dead, not bound, for thirty years What do we do? - Don't worry, he'll wake up - No, he won't - He is a corpse now - Shut up! What do you know? Look, Zibakh never killed anybody. You'll get us into trouble! I told you not to worry, he has to rest after that workout Workout? We massaged his body and got blood running in his blood vessels - He was old but alive - He'll be as fit as a fiddle - He's gone into eternal rest - Shut up! Are you going to tell me what to do? Hands off Did you undo the spell? Yes, his fingers moved I heard he wants to remarry now that he's rejuvenated himself How did you do it? A cup of milk, some abracadabra, and an egg from a black hen - Black hen? - Any nonsense goes Well, I gave him healthy food and revived his body God raises the dead! We are just tools of good will - Give me some blessings - Our souls obey our illusions - I am concerned - About what? Don't push your luck You may try to revitalize someone and they die We're all going to die - How can you be sure of success? - My success is guaranteed How is that? I'll tell you People's fear of the future makes them anxious Anxiety creates the willingness to accept illusions which will force them to believe anything - Do you think so? - And there's more Some will actually hear and see things that do not exist Is that so? Or else, why would people hang on to ancient superstitions? Why do they believe them? - They even watch movies & read about them - Why so? So that they can control their fear of the unknown Come with me Oh yeah, we're all afraid of the unknown I don't get it - Everybody's playing dirty - Get me one of Zibakh's hoods - What for? - So we could play together - Now you're talking - Thanks to you Untie the knots of her fortune Undo the chains of her luck Untie the knots of her fortune Undo the chains of her luck What's with you, foreigner? Have some respect! I am not a foreigner Get lost, or I'll make a scene - I really admire you - I am not what you think If you don't go away, I'll break these slippers on the nape of your neck Believe me, I mean well I'm afraid you'll disappoint me with my customers Oh, you don't believe in me, eh? - Not really - They're here Hello, Tarouta - Welcome - God forbid! Please, come in - Sit down, Tarouta - No, dear, I'll sit over there Yet you came among them! Why did you come? You envy her, and you want her husband!! You are sitting here, as her friend Have mercy on her Have mercy on her - Who do you mean? - I never meant anything They mean and I just spoke out We all mean well, and if you mean well, stay among us Oh my!
