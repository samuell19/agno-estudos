There you are. Hey. You gonna tell me what we're doing out here? Come on. All right. - Oh. - Wow. There's even more than last time. Are you sure we're supposed to be sneaking up on a nest like this? It's a maternity den, the rocks keep them warm. Helping their babies grow. They're so beautiful. You're beautiful. Mara, I hate doing this, you know. Hush up and smile, Dilly. Hey, we're looking for a ride to town. Come here, Bo, come here, Bo. Hey, how are you? I'm fine. Hi, Sister Slaughter. Pastor know you're here? We'll be quick. It oughta be around here somewhere. Oh, got it. You all right? Yeah. Just getting ready for tomorrow. Is that all you're looking for? We should get some of these too. These too. You girls gonna be late for worship. You walk here? Yeah, but it ain't so far. I'll give you a lift, I'm closing up. We got a dog outside. I'll meet you in the lot. Can't believe the party's tomorrow, are you excited? Yeah. 'Course I am. He's late. We don't mind the wait. Hey, y'all get in trouble with my ma? Hey Augie. Come on, girl. Here, let me hold your purse. I missed you. Hey. So you been good? Yeah, you? All right, I guess. All right, scooch in. - Ready? - Mmhmm. Here, careful. Do you some good to join us today. Thanks, Ma, but I'm already pretty full up today. That right? Any more I'd just be plain greedy. Mara! Come on, we're gonna be late. - Amen. - Jesus said, go ye into the world and preach. - Welcome sisters. - The gospel. - Amen, amen, amen. - Amen? Amen. He said, those that believeth in me and are baptized - shall be saved, amen? - Amen. But those that believeth not shall be damned, - shall be damned! - Amen, amen! Hallelujah. These signs shall follow them that flee in my name, in my name, shall they cast out devils. - Amen! - They shall speak - with new tongues, amen? - Amen. - They shall take up serpents. - Amen! - They shall take up serpents. - Amen. And if they drink any deadly thing, - it shall not hurt them, amen? - Amen! - And so what happened? - That little one got bit on the neck. Family prayed all night, but he couldn't fight off the venom and once he passed, the law was up there in no time. Hmm, I see. And since the deceased was still a minor, it ain't gonna stop with him neither. They out for blood. Sorry, Daddy, there was a bit more cleaning tonight. It's all right, Garret and I just having a moment. You hungry? Yes sir. - Well, let's go eat, then. - All right. 7:30. All right. Hey, Big weekend ahead of you? All of us. Yes sir. Well, I'll go rest these old bones. He's a good man, you try not to keep him on hold too long. No, Daddy. You kids get some rest now. Yes sir, just got to clean up. Mara? I just wanted to say... Well, I never thought I'd have this, you know, a girl like you, taking me on. But here you are. You're a beauty, Mara, not just talking about that pretty face of yours. Sometimes I worry you might think too much of me, Garret. It's just the God's honest truth. Thank you, Garret. Well. I better head out. Night, then. Oh loving and kind God have mercy, have pity on me and take away the awful stain of my transgressions. Oh wash me, cleanse me from this guilt. Let me be pure again. For I admit my shameful deed, it haunts me day and night, create in me a new clean heart filled with clean thoughts and right desires, don't toss me aside. Banished forever from your presence. Or take your Holy Spirit from me. But restore to me the joy of your salvation and make me willing to obey you. You all twisted up about Garret? Nerves ain't a sin, you hear me? Now you just follow the spirit as close as you can, he'll guide your path. 'Cause the devil's gonna do his damnedest to ruin the goods you got coming your way. Hey girl! How you doing? How you doing, sweet thing? Hmm? Come to help? Bye. Sorry, Mara, I thought there was more. It's all right. Still no word from your mama? I'm sorry, Dilly. Let's not talk about her, not today. Okay. All right. Better hustle up, then, see what these old hens have in the store for us. All righty. - Two colic babies? - She wouldn't feed them her milk, you ask me. And that Casey Jay. Curse on her poor mama, that girl. All right now, a proposal's been made. And as sisters of this community, we are charged with a serious business, an important decision. Figuring what kind of woman you hope to be and finding the man who's gonna help you do it. Think Connie Ray missed that point last time around. All right, hush up. Harold ain't so bad. So we'll spend the rest of the morning making the quilt and by sundown, Mara's mind must be made on Garret Booner. Oh, it's the young 'uns you got to keep a watch for. They barely bit me, still took my thumb. Holy Ghost shine through me more than once. No doubt about that. What about that boy you raised? All right. Let's get after it, then. Last spring there was some down here. You hear that? Hiding in those rocks, who knows how many? Well, I ain't gonna let you leave here emptyhanded. Go on. Now remember, we respect the serpent but we do not cower to it. Go on, son. So this is where you ran off to. Needed a minute, I guess. Can't seem to rid myself of the damn things. My only vice. But we all got our sins, don't we? You know, I lived a whole lifetime before I found this place For years I was lost, wasn't anybody looking for me. But that's what it's like off this mountain. Buncha dumb sheep, just wandering in the dark. And that's when Zeke found me and brought me here. - He found you a shepherd. - Mhmm. 'Cause who you choose, girl, chooses your whole life. Guess that's why I'm circling. 'Cause when the devil creeps in, shrinking you down, taking your love, you need someone to see the truth even when you don't. Well, I'll leave you to it. Augie? You shouldn't be here. Don't, Mara. Don't what? Don't talk to me like I'm someone else. I'm sorry, I just don't know why you're doing this. Making it harder. Making what harder? Mara. You used to say we was like the wind, 'member? No beginning, and no end. I know. But things were never supposed to get this far. And they can't go any further. I mean, we're never gonna make any sense. We are the only thing that makes any sense in this goddamn place. What's keeping us apart ain't even real, your daddy, his religion, it's got nothing to do with us. It's not just his, it's mine too. I've got the same spirit in me, why don't you see that? I'm the only one who does see it, okay? I know who you are, Mara. You don't know anything. Shoot, Mara, you got to hurry. I'll hurry, don't worry. Still want me to braid your hair? Yeah. All right, come sit. So you made up your mind, did you? You gonna braid my hair or stick your nose in? Fine. Well, I mean, he'll probably treat you nice. Garret's a good man. He hears the spirit in a way that I can't even, you know? Mmhmm. I just thought... What? Maybe you didn't like him much. I like Garret. Maybe it's just time that I grew up and choose a life for myself, and it ain't just a matter of choosing for this life, is it? And you should think about that too. Braid's done. I'll be downstairs. Your mama's dress. My, you look just like her. Could hardly believe it fit. But you ain't her. The Holy Ghost never saw you as a stranger. Now go and take that off. - Praise God today, amen? - Amen. Well, I'm not gonna preach much today. I just wanted to say a few words about my daughter. The Lord... He tested her at a very early age, taking her mama. But Mara has turned into a fine girl. And a good man, a Holy Ghost man, has asked for her hand. So then, you settled on it? My answer is yes. Hey Augie. You ain't at the party with everyone? Just tired, that's all. Yeah, ain't much of a dancing mood either. Come on, I can drop you. All right, thanks. We're hooked up off the edge of the pastor's lot. Oh, well ain't that something to hear. There's a lot more to him, you know. If you just let yourself find out. Why don't you just shoot where you're aiming, Dilly? Just be nice to see you at worship. Yeah. Mara? Your dad and I are heading out. They must have been waiting for us. Just let 'em pass. God's on our side, boy, remember that. Mara? Mara? What? There's trouble at the church. What is it? Wait, what are you doing? You coming? They walked into our house, into God's house, and they took the very thing that allows us to show our devotion to him, our love for him. And why? Because they don't understand it. Because they look down on it. Because they look down on it, they look down on you! On you and you and you! But our struggle is not against flesh and blood. It's not against the man who stands in our path. Our struggle is against the devil that put him there, amen? Amen. But our God, our God is a conqueror and our belief in him is a sword against those that would undo us, amen? Amen. And this mountain? This mountain is our shield. Excuse me. Your hands aren't meant for driving, you know that. I got scared you was in trouble like last time. Garret wouldn't allow it. He said the serpents were his. How long will they keep him? I can't say. He's gonna lose his job at the weld, that's for sure. Come on, let's go home. Morning, Dilly. Pastor. Is everything all right? Everything's fine, Dilly, just came to check in on you, that's all. Oh. Jolene still gone? Yeah, gone for about a month now. Dishes been spoiling for a while. Yeah, for too long. Yes, sir. But that ain't on you, girl, do you understand me? And you ain't got to drown in it no more and you gonna stay with us from now on. A child ain't meant to be separated from her blood, but your mama... She made her choice a long time ago. Now you got a choice you got to make. She can't be a part of you no more. Well, what if she comes back? Well, then she'll come back to an empty house 'cause there ain't gonna be nothing here for her. You understand me? Yeah. All right, then, I'll leave you girls to it. Hey, can I ask you something? Mmhmm? It's just... My ma never told me much. About what? Well... You know what happens before a wedding can take place? I'm supposed to see Sister Slaughter, that's all I know. Oh. Did you hurt yourself? Garret, you're back. I didn't expect you so soon. Even a week in jail's hard on a man. I'm afraid the troubles ain't over yet. Tell me if I hurt you? They came for us before. They tore up the church, took Daddy in the middle of the sermon. I don't know how long he was gone. I was little, so a while I guess. Must've been scary. Garret. What you did for the church, for Daddy... Thank you. I did it for you, Mara. You must know that. Now I love your daddy and the church, well, the church gave me a new life, you know, it drove the demons from my heart. But it is you that keeps 'em gone. Ain't never laid eyes on something so pure. I would do anything to keep you, Mara, anything. Jesus shed blood for us. For our healing. He died on that cross to break the devil's power. Now the devil, the devil, the devil, the devil. The devil has made home in this little boy, in this little child of God - but the Lord can save him. - That's right. - Oh yes he can. - That's right, that's right. Now we must not be deceived by the lies of the material world. The Lord is the only medicine that this boy needs, amen? Amen. Look at me, son. I say out, sickness, I say get out, get out, get out, devil, get out, you have no place here, let the Holy Ghost shine through, heavenly father, shine through him, Clean his heart, Clean his lungs, get out... Get out, get out, get out! Mara, you'll see Sister Slaughter first thing in the morning, you hear me? Yes sir. All right, stand up then. Go on, lay back. Why? There's a process has to happen before a wedding can take place. We all had to go through it, come on. Okay, hold yourself there now. You can sit up. Leave us? Does Garret know? I suppose your daddy didn't neither. No. Best keep it that way for now. Thank you, oh Lord, for this bounty. May it nourish our bodies as you have nourished our souls. In Jesus name, amen. - Amen. - Amen. Mmm, mmm. That's good. What's rustling you, girl? You all right? Think I'll turn in. You know how females are, always getting riled up about something. Damn, this is good, Dilly. Just wait til you try the sweet potatoes. That's where I'm headed. Mmm. Hey. Hey. Hey! Hey. Didn't mean to interrupt. No. Everything okay? Everything's just so mixed up right now and I'm trying to see it and I'm trying to see his plan, what I'm meant for, but I can't see it. - Hey, hey, hey. - I can't see anything. It's all right, come here, it's all right, it's okay. I'm sorry. Mara, Mara, don't. I think you should just go, okay? I don't understand. Look, I'm trying real hard to do what you asked. Just walk away? I got a place down in Leedsburg. Lined up a job. You're leaving? Yeah. I mean, there's nothing left for me here. I better let you get back to it, then. Maybe I'll see you before you go. Yeah. Okay. You been messing around with the pastor's daughter? What? No, Mama, I got to go. She's pregnant. What? You tell me, is that your baby, August? My God. You could burn for this. Just leave God out of this for once, Ma, please. You'll be punished in this life and the next. Stop! God'll have another man raising up your own, claiming yours for his. Don't say that! You have to repent, you have to beg for forgiveness or he will deny you as you have denied him. Okay, you have to make this right, August, please. You have to. Hey. Hey. I'll take one of those too. Of course. Thank you. You know, I took a walk in nature this morning, my property, and I just looked and I listened. He calls to us, the Holy Ghost does, whispering in voices in the wind, in the rain, in the serpent's rattle. But if you get quiet, you can hear him. Can you hear him? I do. I do. Why, the Lord calls a child of our church home. Come on up here, Augie, come on up here, he is calling. Are you ready to submit yourself before the Holy Ghost? Yes, I am. Hallelujah. Praise Jesus, hallelujah, praise God. Thank you, Jesus. Holy Ghost. Praise be to God. Thank you Jesus. Praise be, thank you, Jesus. - Hallelujah. - Thank you, Jesus. Okay. It burns, oh, God, it burns, it burns so bad. Okay, let's see how bad it got you. Please, I need a doctor, please, please. A doctor ain't gonna do nothing for you, son. Only an honest faith is gonna get you through this, Augie, an honest faith and your belief in him. He's asking you to believe in him, son. Believe in him. Ma, Ma, please, please. Please. You listen to your Pastor, boy. You have to save your breath for your prayers. You're being tested. We're all being tested. Come. Jesus, we pray that you'll hold him and you'll surround him and he's loved, in this moment. Came to see if you needed anything. No, darling, just prayers. And rest, best we go downstairs and give it to him. The Lord said when there are two or more gathered in my name, there will I be also. Let us lift up our dear Augie with a song of our Lord Jesus Christ, help him beat the devil that is cutting like acid through his veins. You remember, the devil made a home in this young child, young Jed's lungs, and the prayers had cast him out? Those were your prayers that saved this innocent child and the Lord will hear our call again. He will join in our song. Let the prayer of the faithful raise the one who is sick and the Lord will heal him, in Jesus name, amen. Amen. He's gonna be fine. Just cut a little too deep, is all. Better stitch him up quick. We got clean rags. Can't keep still. All right. I can do it. Um, is he gonna be okay? Hush now, girl, let's let them do this with a little privacy. You as good as lied to me. Let me thinking Garret was the daddy of that baby. I couldn't find my way to the truth of it. Well, God's punishing you both now. Mara's still tending to him? Well, we all got to do our part. Think she's done more than enough now Lemuel. We're a community, son, and he needs her help. Poor boy was asking to go to the hospital. He goes to town, the law'll be here in no time. It'll be for you. Well, then pray, and quiet your heart because mine ain't even whispering. Mara. Mara. I've got to tell the others you're awake. You have to help me. I have to tell the others you're awake. No, no, don't, stay, listen, listen, I need a hospital, please, I ain't gonna make it otherwise. Don't say that. The Holy Ghost called to you in the night and you heard him. He called to you, you heard him. - No. - He ain't gonna abandon you. Listen to me. I didn't hear the Holy Ghost, okay? I never have. Mara, I did it for you. Mara, I will die here, you have to help me, please. Please. I think you better rest, okay? And if you won't pray, then I will. Okay, okay, okay, then can you at least just do it here with me? What in Christ... What are you up to, girl? - Get off me. - You tell me. Take your goddamn hands off her. - Get off me. - You tell me, what are you up to, you tell me. That's enough, boy! Devil's at work here, poisoning her, poisoning you. Now you take yourself home, girl too. Come on. Go. You will stay away from him and that house. Mara? What are you doing? Just listening to the wind. I made you a plate if you're hungry. Thanks, Dilly. Mara? Where are you going? Looking in on Augie. You coming? Oh, you're gonna be the death of me. - Yeah, I'm coming. - Hurry. Do you hear that? Morning, Pastor. I ain't got business with you, Dilly. Get in the car, Mara. Thought he'd find his way out of it by now. I'm so sorry. Sorry? My boy's still fighting, what are you sorry for? I... It's... It's just sad seeing Augie this way. Go on, finish your prayers. This ain't gonna end well for you, son. She'll settle down after the wedding. Not if you don't start acting like a man. Teach her to be a wife, it ain't my place to. That's God's law, that ain't mine. Mara? Better get the soaking tub. Mara? Go on. There are limits to what I'll let you do to me, Garret. This is our fault, Zeke. We let him slip away. Just sat here. Waiting by as the devil hisself crept into his heart. And now we're gonna lose him, we're gonna lose our boy. He ain't gonna make it through another night. Not with that arm, he ain't. Zeke, what are you saying? I'm saying we ain't gonna stand by no more. But it ain't supposed to be up to us no more. The spirit must run his course. God took your thumb, wasn't your daddy. He would've if he had to. Dilly, how is he? He's got that look on him, same as the rest. No, he made it through the first night. You best say your goodbyes. I know you two was close. I'm sorry. This is my fault. Not his, I'm the one that should be punished. Hey. Loving somebody ain't a sin, Mara. It's all right. You don't understand. What? I got his baby in me. Oh no. Oh. Mara. Would y'all go get him? Tonight ain't the night for that kind of behavior. I'll go get him. Garret. Hey, there you are. The Pastor send you to get me or... Do you just love me? Please, Garret, stop, what are you doing? Stop acting like that. Oh. Okay, Dilly Pickett telling me how to act. Okay. This ain't about me. Mmhmm. I came to talk to you. Go on. What important thing do you have to tell me? Um... Go on, little bird. It's about Mara. What about Mara? I'm worried that she's losing herself. She ain't listening to the spirit no more. What makes you think that? Because of Augie. Better go on, tell me. Matthew seven tells us to ask and it shall be given. Heavenly father, I am asking you to reach your strong hands inside this young man's heart to be his strength in his time of need. You trying to make a fool of me, huh? No. Everything that I got, mmhmm, everything that I am, I fucking gave to you, Mara. All of it. I loved you, Mara. I loved you more than anything. Christ, I still do. But it is killing me. You're killing me. You understand that? - I'm sorry... - Beauty, oh? Why'd you lie, huh, why'd you say that you loved me? I didn't. Whoa, whoa, hey. What'd you say? You're hurting me. What did you say? Garret, you're hurting me. Garret, Garret! What in God's name? You don't understand, just let me, let me... Lemuel, she's a whore, Lemuel. Hey, wait a minute, no, no, hey, hey, just wait a minute, no, hey, hey. You get outta here right now. No, you can't put this on me. Go or I swear to God I'll bury you. Don't put this on me, Lemuel. That's not my baby in her. Daddy. It's time to get clean, girl. Harold got more from the vet. Tell the boys we're ready. Satan seduced Eve. So that he could pollute all mankind. Woman is the first sinner and she must be cleansed. Come on, girl, come on and get clean. All right, let her get cleaned, let her get cleaned. By the serpent we'll purify you. By the serpent we'll cleanse you. The serpent will cleanse you. Hold him down. Augie, I'm here, I'm here, boy. The Lord has forgiven you. The Lord has heard your prayers. He has forgiven you, Mara. Augie needs help, and not the kind that we can give him. Hey. You walk out that door, you don't come back. You understand me? Bye, Daddy. Mara, Mara? What are you doing, girl? I came for Augie. He needs a doctor. What he needs is to find his faith and God'll answer. He won't, not Augie, he's not like us, he never was. I won't hear this, what you're saying'll put my boy under, bury him so deep Jesus himself won't find him. Hope. We ain't got no more time. He'll be gone before sunup. That's enough. No, it ain't, honey. We ain't got no more time. You told me that I needed to find someone who sees me like you see each other, through and through. That's Augie for me. And I aim to be that for him. And I ain't gonna let him down anymore. He asked me to take him off this mountain. That's what I'm gonna do, you hear? I hear you. Come on, keys in the truck. Come on. You're gonna be okay.
