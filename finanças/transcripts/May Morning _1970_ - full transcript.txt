- [Narrator] The origin of the May Morning ceremony at Magdalen College Oxford, is not known. The choral ministers of this house do, according to ancient custom, salute Flora every year, on the first of May at four in the morning with vocal music of several parts, which having been sometimes well performed, have given great content to the neighborhood and auditors underneath. (ancient choral music) (bells toll) - Quite true you know about curriculum. - Yes. - I mean it all depends. Every (bells tolling) single foreign country's got a different sort of curriculum. - Yes well where I came from... - By the time they finish, the poor kids don't know whether they're coming or going. (indistinct chatter) (laughing) - I thought that was a marvelous lecture sir, but there's something I want to ask you. When it comes to the interpretation of Latin verse, should one use a modern interpretation, or an ancient interpretation... - Well, you could get away with the ancient one, hello, but we'll take another tutorial, if you don't mind. Excuse me now. (laughs) (bells toll) - Well now what about that lunch today we're going to make. (bells toll) (indistinct chatter) - Wait I'm coming. - Everything is in the here line boss, hey, you are going to Pembroke, would you mind handing that on to Douglas Garmer... - You won't get this till this evening though. (chuckles) - It doesn't matter, thanks. - You're coming to the meeting tonight, Wendy? - No I can't, I'm on a second sitting. - I didn't see you the love-in on Port Meadow. - Well I saw you. - Get me a packet of fags on your way home, would you? (indistinct chatter) - I thought your old man gave a marvelous lecture this morning. - Well he would, wouldn't he? He's been doing it for years. - What's the hurry? - You know very well. I've got lunch in 10 minutes. (indistinct chatter) - Ciao. - Ciao Roderick. (indistinct chatter) - Valerio? - Yes Jeanie? - You are a Rufus? - Yes I am. - Yes, if you see Dennis Barker, can you tell him the rehearsal's been canceled for tonight? - Okay what's the play? - The Marat/Sade. - What are you playing, the sex maniac?

(birds chirp) - Ciao. (lively rock music) - Hey you, what's your name? - Montelli sir. - You know you're not allowed to walk on the grass. I'll have to report you to the dean. - I'm sorry sir. - Alright Montelli. (lively rock music) - Amanda? Hang on. Let's eat together. - Aren't you going to change? - No time. We haven't all got Italian chauffeurs, you know. (giggles) - Why don't you go home to eat? It's so near. - Too near, anyway things are a bit tricky at home. I'd rather not. That's why I still live in college, you know I'm on my second year.

(water sloshes) - Hello. - How are you, sir. - Not too bad. - How's the Rufus lad coming along? - He could be better, how's yours? - Number three is down with appendicitis. - Pity, have you thought of somebody whom we could replace him with? - Not really, got any ideas? Not entirely. - I'll have to think it over carefully, before I decide. (chuckles) - Super. (laughs) (lively rock music) - Look how ruddy comfy he is he'll catch a crab before he starts. (laughs) (lively rock music) - Hut nine, once ground, all together. (water sloshes) (captain shouts out commands) (water sloshes) (lively rock music) - Valerio, that was the captain of the blue, he's got trouble. Number five dropped out two months before the actual boat race, and his reserve is not very good. But I've got a good eye, and I believe that if you were to get down to it Valerio, you're strong enough to replace him. - What would I get out of it? - Well it would be the first time in history that an Italian got into the Oxford crew. But it would mean six hours training a day, no smoking, no drinking, no girls, and I suggest you get rid of that car. (chuckles) - Too many sacrifices for the honor of Oxford. In any case, thanks for thinking of me. - That's alright. ♪ I'll toe the line ♪ ♪ Work all the time ♪ ♪ All float together ♪ - Hello there Charlie. - Of course it's not superficial, if Howard doesn't get it, he's a moron. They'll fine us... - What did he do? - Went into dinner without their gowns. The dean saw them and fined them. - How ridiculous. - Nobody has the right to tell us what to wear. - If you feel like that, why don't you protest? - I'm not prepared to fight about anything quite so unimportant. - I don't think anyone at Oxford is prepared to protest about any vital thing. Haven't you read about the students barricades in Rome, Paris, Berlin? - We don't believe in barricades. They only hold up traffic. - Students are trying to overthrow the system all over the world and you're still discussing whether gowns should be worn at dinner. - We're perfectly prepared to discuss the system and what Oxford represents, but that doesn't give us the right to be violent, or behave like hooligans. - You accept medieval rules. Why not abolish all these ridiculous customs? - There's no point in answering such a stupid question. - Then stop complaining, and continue to wear your old, black gowns, over your hippie gear. - Yeah he's right. - Come on, let's get the boat in the river. Come on lads. Right ready? Prepare to lift, are you ready? Lift. (birds chirping) - Are you ready, stroke. (water sloshes) - Now very slowly stroke right down. (water sloshes) - Steady on the bow side. (water sloshes) - Ease up the pressure. Stevie forward. - Come on. - Huh? - [Coach] Gentlemen. - Come on. - Get the hell out of it. - What are you up to there? (water sloshes) - Are you ready, stroke. (water sloshes) - Point the boat. (boat engine roars) - Pick it up on the port. Give me ten. One. Two. (water sloshes) - Three. Four. Quick and done, come on. (water sloshes) - Straighten up. - Hurry together. (captain shouting commands) (water sloshes) (captains shouting commands) - You know that's a dig, that's a bloody dig. - Don't you touch me. - You stretch your (indistinct) You understand just dip it. No need to reach for the bloody bed. - Just you wait till we get back. (indistinct) - Stop criticizing me, you think... - [Coach] For Christ sake, break it up you two. Save your differences for the dressing room. Think about your rowing. On the trestles, lower. - How was our time? - Too slow, seven minutes and 15 seconds. I'm afraid we're never be chosen to represent the college. - It's taken us two months to make our record. Then you come along and mess everything up. - You know nothing about rowing. It needs teamwork and there wasn't any. - I had the feel of the boat, and you were not pulling. You couldn't resist taking your girl out in a punt before training, could you? - It's none of your ruddy business... - Now come along, you two. - But it is the captain's business... - Break it up. - If you wish to stay in the boat. If you don't, then get out. - Get out yourself. - Valerio. (clattering thud) - Now, pack that in. - I think it's a case of genetic insufficiency. Take my advice. Get out of Oxford before you're thrown out. - Why didn't you chuck him off the eight? - That's easier said than done. - It's gonna be a bloody set harder for us to throw him out of college. - Roderick, do you mind? I want to talk to you. I put you down for the Hodges Memorial Prize. - No sir. - You're bound to win it. - It's an extremely difficult contest sir. In two months time, I've got my grades. I think I would rather be left out. - I'm banking on you Roderick. I've already spoken to the dean. I don't mind telling you, if you win I shall be very pleased. - Yes I think I understand you sir. - Then you'll have a go? - Yes. - Good lad. (indistinct) (indistinct chatter) - Why aren't you sitting at your own table, with the oarsmen? - Just a little difference of opinion. Do you mind if I sit here with you? - Sometimes I think it would do you good to sit with the eggheads, but not too often, because you'll always be hearty. (indistinct chatter) - How's Montelli coming along? - Could do better. - How's he getting along with the discipline? - Rather unsatisfactory I'd say. - Surely Finlake, it's your job to persuade him to try harder, isn't it? - He's very stubborn. - He's not doing too badly, from my point of view, though he does create a few problems in the boathouse, but he's one of the best oarsmen we've got. - Unfortunately, it's not good oarsmen we need, it's good scholars. (indistinct chatter) (lively rock music) - What a lofty silence. - They want to throw me out of Oxford just because I'm Italian. - Nationalism doesn't exist here, only Oxford exists then the outside world. Even the river Thames is only allowed to pass through Oxford, providing here it changes it's name and becomes the Isis. Don't try to be so different from all the rest, you're too impulsive. Camouflage yourself. Impulsiveness is something we don't tolerate much here. - So, what do you think I should do? - Talk to your tutor. By the way, why did you choose Finlakein the first place? - They gave me a list of dons, I close my eyes, and my finger fell on Finlake. (speaking in foreign language) - Which for those of you who don't speak Latin, means watch where you put your finger. (birds chirping) (knocks on door) - Good morning, sir. - Montelli, don't you ever knock before you come in? - I did knock sir. - Let me see your work. Is this all? - I've been very busy training sir. - I know all about your exploits, Montelli. - You've already been told about this morning's incident? - I'm responsible for your conduct, as well as your studies. I don't think either is very satisfactory. - I don't think my friends like me, and I don't think you do either, sir. - I was on the committee that examined your entrance papers, Montelli. I voted against you. You're cultural background's third-rate, but you managed to get in just the same, with the help of outside pressure. We're very jealous of our autonomy at Oxford. We don't like to be taken advantage of. But you force us to turn a no into a yes. Your excitability and your distrust make you too vulnerable. It's all the same to me whether you stay on at Oxford, or whether you go. Sit down, and let's begin this tutorial. - Sorry sir. (bells toll) - Hi Roderick. - Have you finished your tutorial already? It was a bit short, wasn't it? - I hadn't prepared much, so there was nothing very much to do. - Valerio, why don't we take advantage of your free time, perhaps get in a spot of extra rowing practice. - I sweated enough for the eight this morning. - It'd be a good opportunity to show Adam that you haven't got a grudge against him. - Don't waste your time. He'll go on the river, but not rowing. - You're right, I'm going to phone Amanda now. - Twice with the oars is too much for you, isn't it? You're much better with a pole. (laughs) - Do you think Finlake's a bit queer? - What do you mean? - I mean, do you think he's homosexual? - I don't think it's any of my business nor is it any of yours. (soft rock music) - Amanda. Amanda? (soft rock music) - [Flora] Valerio. - Ciao. - She's having a bath, but you can come wait in my room, if you want. - Okay. (soft rock music) - How are you getting on at Oxford? - They snub me a bit. (indistinct) - Your father for example. I get the impression he can't stand me, even though he tries to hide it. - Don't worry, he's like that with everyone, even with me. - Listen, would you take me one day? Punting, I mean, just the two of us? Don't get the wrong idea. I was only joking. - I didn't think I'd see you until this evening, your phone call didn't give me much time to get ready. I asked Flora to look after you. - She did. - Bye Flora. - Are you sure you were only joking? (soft rock music) - Valerio. I've got the news for you. I've been talking to the rowing coach, and your name came up again. - If it's about your offer this morning, my answer remains the same. (laughs) - Well come and have a sherry in the senior common room, I think I can make you change your mind. You know Valerio, you have an unfortunate habit of making enemies, not only among the undergraduates, but higher up too. - You mean Finlake. - Remember that he's not only your tutor, but the dean of your college, as well. - What do you mean by that? - Well you make a false move, and he'll send you down. - I've got the impression, sir, that you could get me out of this dangerous situation. - Yes, well that's what I wanted to talk to you about. I've spoken to the captain of the Oxford crew, and he's willing to try you out. You know, if you were to become a blue, then that would give you special privileges. You know, in living memory, a blue's never been sent down. - And what about Finlake? - A blue is a blue to him too. - What do you get out of it? - Just the satisfaction of knowing that I've sent someone from my college up to London to defend the honor of Oxford. - Alright then. In that case, I'll make all the sacrifices necessary. - Good.

(laughs) - Look at Valerio. Doesn't smoke, doesn't drink, doesn't, forget it. - Look you can tell me, not once all this month, not even a little one, for old times sake? - Keep guessing. - Bet he slips up tonight, anyway. - No one could resist the temptation of Oxford balls. - Are you going to grace us with your presence at the ball tonight? - Keep your eyes open, maybe you'll see me. - For God's sake, come on.

Do you usually come tromping across the lawn? - Well I wanted to see what don's house is like. What are you doing here? Have you been rusticated? - Will you help me choose a dress? Italians are always supposed to have good taste. Father's got a bit of a cold today. - Maybe he'll cancel my tutorial then. - Maybe. - Not bad, but it needs more color. (chuckles) Don't you mind me seeing you naked? - Why should I? Besides, you're in training. (chuckles) (rock music) - Go away. This is my room, I can do exactly what I like in it. I'm not a child anymore. - [Valerio] Who was that? - My mother. - God. - Don't worry about it. She doesn't mean anything anymore. - Maybe not, but she'll tell your father. (chuckles) - [Flora] No, she won't. - How can you be sure? - She knows that I'd never forgive her if she did. - Ciao, I think I'd better beat it. (birds chirp) (doorbell chimes) - Good morning. Is Mr. Finlake in? - Yes he's just arrived, come in. - How is your cold, sir? - A little bit better, thank you. Now then Montelli, what was the subject of your essay? The influence of the Medicis on something or other, wasn't it? - I haven't been able to write a word, sir. I have my rowing practice twice a day, you know what it's like. - That's no excuse. Look at Roderick. He's spent the last days glued to his desk. Of course, you don't think very highly of intellectuals, now you're a blue. Who's there? - It's Flora leaving. She came back to pick up a dress for the ball tonight. - I want to speak to her. (percussive rock music) - [Finlake] Flora, wait a moment. - Why only two cups, are you not having any? - No. (percussive rock music) - You know, Roderick's great weakness is cricket, and he's sure to be at the Rufus match today. If you see him there, tell him to get on with his verses. It's absolutely imperative he finish them today. I just told Flora to leave him alone. I hope she keeps her word. He can relax and enjoy himself tonight at the ball. While we're on the subject, I shall sleep in college tonight, I expect the dons party will go on rather late. (chuckles) - He never bothers to tell me when he spends the night in college. Sometimes I think I'm the only person who lives here. - You know, Montelli, until the last century, dons at Oxford weren't allowed to marry. The Anglican reform allowed priests to wed, but not dons. A don wasn't thought able to cope with his wife and class. That's why our houses have that guilty atmosphere about them, we still haven't got used to being married men. Well, as we haven't been able to do any work today, and we've already had coffee, I think the best idea is for me to upstairs to my room and have a rest. - Goodbye Ma'am. - Goodbye. - Enjoy yourself at the ball, Montelli. - Thank you, sir. (groovy rock music) (bat smacks) (groovy rock music) (bat smacks) - Go on ya fool, run. (groovy rock music) - It's an out. (applause) (groovy rock music) - Well, I must leave you mortals to sport and return to college, and higher thought. (groovy rock music) - I'll go up to your room after lunch. - And disobey daddy? Better not distract the poet. - But I won't distract you. - A promise hard to keep. Of course, you could inspire me. (groovy rock music) - So you got your courage back, have you? Pity you didn't get it back sooner, before leaping out of the window. - I didn't know you were looking for a hero. I thought you just wanted someone to go to bed with. - I'm not looking for anyone. If you touched me, it's 'cause I gave you permission. That permission is now withdrawn. - I don't need permission from anybody. - Don't you? Then why didn't you stay? Afraid that my father might tell Roderick? - I'm not a coward, I'll tell him myself. (groovy rock music) - Roddy. - Yes. - Could I have a word with you? - Of course. (groovy rock music) - When I went to Finlake's for my tutorial, Flora was there alone. I tried to make love to her, but she gave me no encouragement, and I can't bear to think I've been disloyal to you. - Since it was a purely physical thing, it's altered nothing in our relationship. - I knew you'd understand, and I'll never forget the way... - That's where you're wrong. We'll forget the whole thing immediately. (soft rock music) - Flora it must have been your fault, as well. Our Italian friend wouldn't ever have touched you unless you wanted him to. Anyway, it couldn't have been very exciting for you. - How do you know? - If it had been, you wouldn't have forced him to make that phony confession. (chuckles) - No, you're right. It wasn't very good. - Well, I must be going. Wanna go back and watch the end of the cricket match? - Would I see you again? - I hope so. This afternoon, nothing's changed you know. (soft rock music) - Roddy. Can you come down? - I'm afraid the library's not open this afternoon. It's the only place I can find the references I need, what do you want? - To tell you the truth about what happened between me and Flora. - Haven't you already told me? - No. I know I'm too impulsive. On the way back to college, I thought I must give you a proof of friendship. - If you think I want revenge, you're mistaken. (chuckles) Let's forget proofs of friendship, you've already given me one. - I swear I came here out of friendship. That's the only thing that counts. Not women, they're all alike. I didn't force Flora this morning. She let me find her naked, and practically dragged me into bed. Now, I've told you. Keep your eyes open. - You've certainly opened my eyes, but to you, not to Flora. I've always thought of you as an unpleasant individual, but harmless. I was wrong, you're a dangerous person. - I came here to put you on your guard, and you... - You thought you were doing me a favor by offering me this filthy sort of masculine camaraderie, but it's an insult. - Listen, you've got it wrong. - Then you should explain yourself better. You're a sick human being, you stand for all the things I find intolerable, disloyalty, cheating, the mafia, and I consider it my duty to protect my fellows from infection. - Alright then. Be a cuckold if you want, but look out Roderick, if you try to trick me, you'll pay for it. (indistinct chatter) - Excuse me, sir. Mr.Whipple at 10 table wants to speak with you. - Thank you. (indistinct chatter) - I'm coming down to watch you this afternoon, so you'd better be on your toes. - I'll do my best sir. - Montelli, good show boy. I gather you're keeping the colors flying like a true Englishman. - Thank you sir. - I discovered him, I'm proud to say. - Yes, well don't let it go to your head Whipple. You'd better go back and eat boy, we gotta keep your strength up. - Valerio. - Yes. - Are you going to come sit with the eggheads today? Remember, I told you it does you good occasionally, to exercise the mind as well as the body. - Then I will. (indistinct chatter) - John, would you mind giving this to Brian, and asking him to carry it over to LMH for me, please. I suppose you saw your tutor today, along with the rest of the family. As he's not in the hall, I'd like to know how he is. - He's alright. He's resting for the don's party tonight. - I understand that in Italy, they're preparing for great celebrations in honor of Machiavelli's birth. (laughs) - I don't see what's so funny about that. - It's ridiculous for the Italians to want to commemorate a man who's brought nothing but dishonor to them, throughout the world. (scoffs) - [Valerio] That's an outdated viewpoint. - When we talk of the devil, we often call him Old Nick. Now according to the Oxford dictionary, this nickname for the devil actually comes from Niccolo' Machiavelli. A hypothesis is most suggestive. Machiavelli has become the personification of certain national defects, like disloyalty and cowardice. As the fathers of the church would say, all the arts used by the devil to seduce the soul. - If you know so much about the subject, why don't you write an essay on Niccolo' Machiavelli? - I would only write a thesis on something which interests me. For instance, the negative aspect of the process of natural selection in Italy. The process of positive selection is a mechanism to preserve the strongest of the species and eliminate the weak. The invasion by barbarian hordes and long years of slavery have produced in Italy, a negative selection. The strong have been eliminated, and the weak remain. Now obviously, the weak in order to survive, have to use methods which come naturally to the weak, like disloyalty, cowardice, treachery. Machiavelli was the interpreter of this evolution, or biological and moral involution. - This tirade is obviously intended for me, personally. - You personally don't interest me. - You're insulting Italians just because I went to bed with Flora. (indistinct chatter) - Sconce. - [Whipple] Hey look at old Roderick. - What's going on? - [Whipple] He's sconcing Montelli. - Yes sir. - I wish to sconce Mr.Montelli. - Do you wish to appeal against sconce, sir? - No. - Sir, Mr.Montelli has been sconced. - Does he appeal? - No, sir. - Very well, you know what to do. - You realize what this means. Now he'll have to drink almost two quarts of beer. - A strong lad, he'll knock it back in no time. - But that's not the point, sir. It'll ruin him for rowing. He might have to be replaced on the crew. - You know Whipple, how often must I remind you that discipline comes first. Now young Montelli's only problem is to knock it back in 25 seconds, otherwise, he'll have to pay for it. - Roderick, why did you sconce him? - I accuse him of expressing opinions of a personal nature, not allowed in hall. (indistinct chatter) - [Student] Sconce, what is sconce? - [Student] Well, it's a sort of penalty. He's got to get down two whole quarts of beer, and if he doesn't, he's got to stand the lot of us a round of drinks. - [Student] I'm all for that. (laughs) (indistinct chatter) (beer sloshing) - [Student] Old Montelli is being awkward. - That'll put him under the table for a couple of days. - I'll say it will. (indistinct chatter) - Your sconce, sir. (cheers) - [Roderick] Now that's what I call beer. - [Student] Come on, Montelli, drink it down. - [Student] Come on Montelli. - [Student] Let's see what you made of. (lively guitar music) (suspenseful music) (beer pours) (outraged shouting) - Will you tell them to stop that noise at once? (bangs table) - Gentlemen, stop the noise at once. (students chanting) - Out, out, out. (birds chirp) (water sloshes) - Sorry to be late. - You've been replaced, Montelli, and not just for today. - What? What have I done, are you crazy? - We don't want you in the crew with us. - Hey you've got my oar. - Don't you understand, I've taken your place permanently. - You can't do that, you lousy bastard, it's my place. - Not anymore. (grunts) (water gurgles) (birds chirp) - Oars ready, are you ready? Go. (water sloshes) - It's the first time I've been late sir. I took a long walk after the sconce, I was so angry. - You weren't dropped because you were late it was because you refused the sconce. What do you expect? - But I'm 10 times better than the man who replaced me. - They know that, but they'd rather that than row with someone they don't respect. - I'll get back on the crew. - Don't count on it. Your only chance is to get Roderick back on your side. Maybe he can persuade them to take you back. - [Valerio] I apologize. I'll do it publicly, if you like. I'll accept the sconce, tonight in the hall, anything. Look Roddy, a word from you and they'll take me back on the crew. - I'm amused by your faith in my influence with the others, but it's exaggerated. I'm sorry, you'll just have to work this thing out for yourself. - My place in the eight is very important to me, 'cause as long as I'm a blue, I'll pass my exams and not be rusticated. I can't risk that. I know I've broken the rules, but try to understand, I'm a foreigner. - You're not a foreigner, you're just an outsider. - I've learned my lesson. Please give me another chance. - No one's denying it you, you're still an undergraduate. - Not for long, unless I'm a blue. - That's your problem. While your here, would you do me a favor? - Anything. - How would you translate bicycle into Latin? (speaking in foreign language) (giggling) (paper rustles) - Roddy, that's your only copy of the poems. (book smacks) (Valerio grunts) - Why Don't you do one thing well? (muffled grunting) (head bangs) - You swine, you swine. (percussive rock music) - You should carry a bell, like a leper. - How is Roderick? - They thought he was suffering from a concussion, but he's an egghead with a very tough shell. Now, here's a bit of advice for you. Keep out of the way. Do you know you're not exactly popular at the moment? (upbeat rock music) - Flora. I'm glad Roderick's alright. Can I go and see him? I want to ask him to forgive me. - You can do that yourself, at the ball. He's coming, you know. You haven't succeeded in putting him out of action. - That's not what I wanted to do. - But Roderick has succeeded in putting you out of action. The dons are meeting to discuss your fate. I bet they won't give you more than 24 hours to pack your bags and get out of here. (engine revs) (birds chirp) - Good evening sir, yes? - Whiskey please. - Yes, a single or double? - A bottle. - Bottle. - Right sir, that's five pounds. - Five? - Thank you very much. - I thought if she could take a stall at the bazar, it would be a great help. - Yes, let's do that. - I shall be seeing her... - Good evening, Mrs.Finlake. - Good evening. But I could ask her then, if you like, we might go. (water rushing) (birds chirp) - I thought you'd be at home, looking after your husband's cold. - The college telephoned and he left in a hurry. Something important probably. - Don't you know? - Know? - The dons are meeting because I bashed in Roderick Stanton's head. - But they could send you down from Oxford for that. - Would you care? - Yes, yes I would. I like you and I'd be very sorry, if I thought I'd never see you again. - Maybe you can see me tonight. - You don't want to spend a boring evening with me. Haven't you a girlfriend? - Yes, I could bring her too. - Yes, bring her. (laughs) - What will you do? Leave us alone, and then spy on us like this morning? And then join us? (bells chime) (loud knock) - Yes. - May I come in? - Of course. I was expecting you, sir. - I have a communication for you. - Why don't you sit down? - Thank you. - Have a sherry? - Thank you. - There you are, sir. - Thank you. We had a dons' meeting. I expect you'd already guessed you'd be rusticated. After the incident with Roderick, we had no option. - Rusticated, what a funny word. In Latin, it means reduced to a rustic condition, or countrified. It's a pity Roderick's not here to listen to me expounding on Latin etymology. - A great pity. Roderick's hurt, but you won't get to trouble. He told the hospital he had an accident. - How very generous of him. - One should not mix the good name of the college with personal squabbles. (scoffs) - Whatever happens, save Oxford's honor. But we all know Roderick's alright you've thrown me out on an excuse. When does my rustication begin? - You'll leave the college by tomorrow night. - So soon? (knock) - I pressed your jacket, sir. - Thank you. At least then, I can enjoy the ball, and hear the May Morning Hymn from Magdalen Tower. - I don't think it would be prudent of you to join in the festivities. The students are very annoyed with you. - Is there anything that could stop me? - Only your own good sense.

(indistinct chatter) - Come on, ya get your finger out man. - Okay Fred. - One, two, one, two three, about one, two. Well, here we are now in the Vale (indistinct) and it's great to be here, and we're looking forward to the illustrious group which is our big event here, this evening. In our minds he got himself, he's up here on his royal throne, wearing his royal colors and handing out judgements led by descent is handing out judgments to to the good people on the right, to the bad people on the left. Which side are you going to be on, Valerio? - I'm not in the running, I've been rusticated. - That's just too bad, it's your own fault for going to Rufus. But that won't affect our personal relationship, will it? - No. - Thanks very much. This is manna from heaven. (band warming up) - Want one? - Not now, later. - Fair enough. We're going on.

(rock music) (piano music) - It's coming from the chapel. I wonder who it is. - I think I know. Follow me. (piano music) (distant rock music) (piano music) - Tell me Roderick, when they x-rayed your head today, did they find anything other than your self-importance? - He's quite harmless, now. - More than that, he's had a mystical crisis. While all the others are dancing out on the lawn, he's sitting alone in a chapel. - He's made his choice between the sacred and the profane. - I think it's quite profane to play in church like that. - You know, your friend has a very limited idea of what is profane. - You can't do more than you have already. - Time is running out. I leave tomorrow, but the night is long. - I think we should throw him out. - I thought the church gave asylum, even to murderers. - None of us denies that, but if we come to grips, don't expect us to support that theory. - I won't come to grips with you again but I might with one of your birds. (distant rock music) - There may be asylum in church for murderers, but not for shits. Come on.

Hope this isn't the last of it, don't you? - I'm going to make sure I get all of my share. - If you're afraid of staying sober, look at that there's enough alcohol there to knock the whole college out. - Look who's coming. - Christ. (soft rock music) - A bottle of champagne. - Certainly sir, for how many? - Just for me. - I'm awfully sorry, sir, but a bottle has to do for six people. I can give you a glass if you like. - Okay. - Give him a glass of water. (soft rock music) (indistinct chatter) - What you gonna do? - I'm going to weigh their shit-ness against mine and see which way the scales of justice tip. - Being kicked out is hard to swallow, aye? - It's their filthy hypocrisy I can't swallow. (scoffs) - Don't give me that rhetoric. They say you're only in this mess because of Finlake's daughter. - In a way, yes. - Is this the first common ball you've been to? - Yes. - They'll all be paralytic soon. Her too. - I know. That's what I'm waiting for. - Then you better move fast, before somebody else does. (lively rock music) (indistinct chatter) - Why don't you ask your daughter to join us for a drink. - That's very kind, sir. Would you mind if she brought Roderick Stanton? - No, not at all, it'd be a pleasure. - Alfred, will you go to marquee and ask Mr. Stanton and my daughter Flora to join us here? - Yes. - Thank you. - And why not? - Most civil of you, sir.

At least not in England. What are you waiting for? The party's nearly over. - For me it's just begun. - The Finlake girl. Where is she? On her back in the grass with the rest? - That's something she'll never do. She's high, but not paralytic. - You've kept your eye on her, aye? - Yeah, at this moment, she's chatting to her father. (chuckles) - You've chosen the wrong moment to make your kill. - No, it's exactly the right moment. I've been waiting to join the family reunion. (soft rock music) - Tomorrow, you'll all be sleeping it off, so there won't be another opportunity to say goodbye. - No one's gonna miss you. - I know, but tonight, I can say I shall miss Oxford more than I thought I would. - There are plenty of good universities in other places. - Not in Europe. They're not so advanced. They would never understand the cultural significance of what's happening here, in the marquee, under the trees and maybe inside the college itself. - Montelli, if you're trying to insinuate that Oxford is no more than a brothel, you are merely proving, once again, that you don't understand our life. - Only someone from an insecure cultural background could confuse pornography with freedom. - Maybe you're right, but in that case, why isn't Mrs. Finlake here, enjoying that wonderful freedom... - That's none of your business. - Of course not, but she must feel neglected, sitting alone at home, wondering why she can't share this freedom. - She understands it much better than you do. - If my mother's not here, it's 'cause she doesn't want to be. - Really? Then why did she ask me to visit her tonight, during the ball? - What are you leading up to? - You get out. - I suppose you're hoping that mother's going to throw him out. (scoffs) - The situation won't arise. He'd never have the courage to present himself at my house, even if he had been invited by your mother, which I very much doubt. - You know perfectly well that she's irresponsible enough to do it. - Afraid I agree with Flora there, sir. - In what way? - Why won't you face up to the fact of what he's trying to do? He's seeing how far he can push us, and he's using mother to push us all into the mud. - Are you telling me that mother's a whore? (slap) - Here take the car keys, go and see for yourself. - I think I can avoid anything unpleasant happening. - Thank you, Roddy. I see you realize you're in a much better position to deal with this than I am. - Flora. You're letting your imagination run away with you. Your mother may be irresponsible, but she's not immoral. - I don't know anymore. - Come on, let's get back to the party. - You're afraid, just like he is. - She's your mother, not mine. (doorbell chimes) - Good evening Mrs. Finlake. - What do you want? - Your invitation, don't you remember? - I don't know what you're talking about? What invitation? - To bring my girlfriend round to meet you. Nobody knows I'm here. - Go away. Take here with you, she's drunk. - I can't take her back now. She doesn't feel well. Give her time to recover. - But what can I do? - Let her lie down on your bed. Just for a minute. (bed clatters) - I think a cup of strong coffee would do her good. I'll go and make it. - But first, we should undress her, don't you think, Mrs. Finlake? - Yes, yes I think so. - [Valerio] Will you help me? (soft rock music) (soft groaning) (sobs) (heavy breathing) (sobs) (engine roars) (pleasant flute music) (distant laughs) (indistinct chatter) - You've got up as well, even for 20 pounds. I brought the thing down to keep the fantas warm, and this is the last one, and it's all mine. (kisses bottle) - I don't want any. - Well hurry up or you'll have to swim? The others have gone to the chapel tower. (laughs) (rock music) - Get flat, go on, get flat. (soft thud) (squeals) (screams) - What the hell do you want? - I came here to give you a hand. - Well, you can wait your bloody turn now, can't you? (rock music) (muffled screams) (screams) (terrified gasps) (screams) (sobs) (rock music) (soft rock music) (soft moans) (rock music) - I want to go and join the others. - It's better if you go home. - Fred, Jack, will somebody give me a lift? - I will. (water rushing) (Valerio splashes) - See if you can get out of the water. - Come on, get him. - Get him, get him. - Get a paddle. (oar smacks) - Come on, get down and stay down. (oars smacks) (loud splashes) - [Student] Harder, harder. Everyone get in there. Fucking put him under. (oars smacking) (Valerio grunting) (indistinct chatter) - Down down. (water splashes) (tired grunting) - He's disappeared, he got he message. (laughs) - Are you coming? (laughs) Come on, lass.
