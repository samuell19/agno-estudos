Red licorice is totally awesome. - Mmm! So is orange zest! - Banana surprise. - Mint chocolate chip. - Blueberry cream. - Purple mist. - A purple mist Shiver Cone? I don't think I tried that one. - No, look, purple mist. - Huh. - Well, that's strange. - Whoa! both: Whoa! [Zain caws] all: Whoa! Whoa! [all groan] - Huh, that was weird. - Yeah. - Delicious. But definitely weird. - Hmm, what happened to the carpet? - [squawking] - Whatever happened to the carpet also happened to Zain. - Zain, you can't fly either? - Uh-uh. - Wow, and he's got wings. - No, no, no, no, no, no! Even I can't fly. - What? I can't fly either. - Neither can I. - It's like there's no more flying in Zahramay Falls. - Is it just me or does this feel like a disaster? Because I'm pretty sure this is a disaster. - [squeaks] - Don't worry, Kaz. There has to be some explanation. - Yeah, it'll be okay. I'm sure we'll figure it out. - Hey, maybe it has something to do with that weird purple mist we flew through. - It's coming from that way. - Yeah, let's check it out. Shine: Whoa, the Mist is coming from the falls. - [panting] Running is a lot... more work than flying. Whew. - Shimmer, look at the water. - Huh, there's red, orange, yellow, green and blue, but no purple. Didn't there used to be purple? - There definitely used to be purple. - Maybe the purple water turned into all this mist. - This is not right. - It most certainly is not. - Princess Samira. - Princess, our carpet won't fly. - And neither can we. - I was afraid of that. It seems like anything that touches this purple mist can't fly anymore. If the purple water were here, this wouldn't be happening. - In that case, I wish the purple water was back where it belongs. - Boom Zahramay. First wish of the day. Shimmer and Shine. Wish granted divine. [gasps] Hey! - Leah's wish didn't work! - That's because for genie magic to work, all the colors of the Rainbow Water need to be here. But if a color goes missing, magic won't work the way it should. I need to stay here in Zahramay Falls to protect the other genies from this mist. But someone needs to find out what's causing the problem in the first place. - Ooh, ooh, can we help? - We're really good at helping. - I know you are, and I'm counting on it. I'm sending you three girls to find Imma, the Waterfall Genie. It's her job to take care of the Rainbow Water. You should be able to find her in the land of Rainbow Zahramay. It's just beyond this waterfall. - Ooh, this is huge! - Huger than huge. - I didn't even know there was a land beyond the waterfall. - There is, but we've never, ever, ever been there before. - Rainbow Zahramay is a very powerful place. Not everyone is allowed to go there, but you girls have done some amazing things. I think you're ready. [all giggling] - Um, Princess Samira, how do we get to Rainbow Zahramay if our carpet's not working? - Oh, you'll need something special for that. You'll need this. - Whoa. - Double whoa. [whirring] - Ooh. - Climb aboard, girls. - Whoa. - Wow. - [chuckles] - Ooh. - Whoo. - Oh. - Amazing. - I can't believe this. - Whoa. - Amazing. - Whoa. ♪ ♪ Kaz: A boat. Zac: Amazing. - This boat will help you travel through the Rainbow Water to the other side of the Falls. - This boat is Zahramazing. - I'm glad you think so, because now it belongs to you. Come on, I'll show you how it works. - [gasps] Look at all the... Ahhh! Genie Gems! - These gems power and steer the boat. - A gem-powered boat. - Whoo-hoo! You guys gotta try this slide! This boat has its own ball pit! - Oh, my genie! Count me in. - [clears throat] - I mean, count me in after we find Imma. - Okay, ready to go? - Um, Princess Samira, do you really think I'm ready to go to Rainbow Zahramay? 'Cause I gotta say, I don't really feel ready. More like not ready. Who knows what kinds of scary things we could find there. - Come on, Kaz! It'll be fun! - Actually, boys, I have a different job for you. I need you to go to the marketplace and warn the genies about this purple mist. - Cool! - We can do that. - [Zain squawks] - Whatever you need, Princess. - Excellent. Then let's get started. - [Zain chirps] Oh, just one little thing. This will protect your boat from the purple mist. - Thanks, Princess Samira. - Good luck, girls. - Be careful. - Good luck! - Here we go!

That purple mist is everywhere. - Whoa! - Ohh! I can't fly. - And I can't float. - We really need to find that Waterfall Genie. - Excuse me. Do you know where we can find Imma? - Oh, sure, just head that way. - Towards the Rainbow Gates. - And when you find Imma... - Tell her to fix the Rainbow Waters. - We can't fly. - Or float until she does. - Will do! Thanks! [genies groaning, grunting] Shimmer: See anything yet? Leah: Look! all: Whoa! Leah: Those must be the Rainbow Gates. Now all we have to do is find Imma. Shine: Let's stop right here. Leah: Come on. - Oh, where is it? I have to find it. - Hi there. Are you Imma, the Waterfall Genie? - I'm Imma all right. At least, I don't know who else I'd be. I've always been Imma, so I guess I still am. - Well, that's good, 'cause we came here to find you. I'm Shimmer. - And I'm Shine. And this is our best friend, Leah. - Hello. - Ohh! I want to know everything about you. What you like. What you don't like. Your favorite colors. Oh, speaking of colors, I don't know if you've noticed but there's no more purple water in the Rainbow Waterfall. And for magic to work, the Rainbow Waterfall needs all its colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. - We definitely noticed. - Can you fix it, Imma? - I can fix it. I just need to find my staff. Oh, I know I left it around here somewhere. - Well, we can help you look for it. - You can? Oh, that would be great. If you see a long stick with a rainbow jewel, that's my staff. At least, I don't know what else it would be. - What exactly does your staff do, Imma? - It opens and closes all the Rainbow Gates. See that giant genie bottle? All the water in Zahramay Falls flows from it. The purple gate is now closed, but with my staff, I can open it back up. Then magic will start working again. - Well, then I hope we find your staff soon. - Before things get really crazy in Zahramay falls. - Now remember, Zac, Princess Samira told us to keep everyone away from the purple mist. - Got it. Okay, genies, listen up. - Wait, Zac, you need to tell them gently. We don't want them to panic. - Panic? - No, no, there's no reason to panic. - Ohhh. - I mean, there's a little reason to panic. Well, it's not every day that a purple mist appears, putting an end to all flying and wish magic. - What? [all screaming] - But, Kaz-- - We need to warn them not to get near the purple mist. Uh-oh. - Too late. - Okay, now you can panic. [all screaming] Imma: Did you find anything? - Nope, not yet. - Don't worry, Imma. We'll help you find your staff. both: [chirping] - Ohhh. Aren't you just the cutest little critters? - This is Lili... - [chirps] - And that's Sai. - [chirps] - They love to play games and make each other laugh. - [chirping] - See what I mean? - How are they flying? - They must have not been touched by the purple mist. That reminds me, we're in the middle of something really important. - We'd love to stay and play with you guys, but we don't have time right now. all: Bye! both: [chirping] - Hey, maybe your staff is over there. [both laughing] [chirping] - Ohh, it's not here either. - Wait, Imma, is that your staff? - Yes! Lili and Sai found it! And it look like they're heading to the blue gate. - But why? - No, don't do that! - Uh-oh, Lili and Sai used your staff to shut off the blue water. They must think they're playing a game. - I bet they shut off the purple water, too. - That can't be good. - No, not good. Not good at all. [tense music] Leah: Uh-oh. Here comes the blue mist. Shimmer: What will it do, Imma? - I really don't know. - Ahh! - Whoa! - The blue mist is making shooting stars. - Lots of them. - Hurry, we have to get my staff back. It's the only way to fix this. ♪ ♪ Look, there's Lili and Sai! [both chittering, chirping] - Aww, Lili and Sai are so cute. But this is a big problem. - It'll be an even bigger problem if this starts happening in Zahramay Falls. - This is a disaster! No one can float, no one can fly. And everybody knows that genies are terrible jumpers. [grunts] Whoa! See? - Look on the bright side, Kaz. The purple mist has already drifted away. So what else could go wrong? - You had to ask, didn't you? - Oh, no. Blue mist? - Yep, what kind of crazy magic do you think it'll cause this time? - Zac, you have got to stop asking questions. - Shooting stars? - Cool. [grunts] Whoo-hoo! Awesome! - Zac, be care--whoa! Whoa! - First purple mist and now blue. - Ahh! - What in the genie world is going on back there? [Lili and Sai chirping] - Lili, Sai, wait! - Uh-oh, they're headed for the green gate. - Then follow those critters! I've always wanted to say that. - Don't they understand... Whoa! ...that every time they turn off a color... Yikes! ...more strange stuff will happen? [both chittering] - Oh no, now they shut off the green water. And here comes the green mist. - That's a problem, right, Imma? - It's a little problem. Or it could be a big problem. - Huh. I guess it's no problem. Ooh. - Whoa! - The mist turned the ground bouncy. - Uh-oh, we're bouncing away from Lili and Sai. all: Whoa! Whoa! Shine: What do we do now? - The shooting stars are going everywhere. What should we do now? - We can wait and see what the green mist does. both: Whoa! Whoa! - Whoa! - Whoa! - Ohh! - And you said genies weren't good at jumping. - [caws] - Oh, I hope the girls fix the Rainbow Water soon. - Don't worry, Kaz. I'm sure they have everything under control. - This is kinda out of control. - Whoa! - Oh, yeah? - Totally. - We have to stop Lili and Sai before they turn off any more gates. - How are we gonna do that if we're bouncing? - Hey, I think I'm getting the hang of this. - Yeah, if we can bounce toward Lili and Sai... - Then we could get Imma's staff back. - All right, come on! - Whoa, right behind you!

But for the most part, this really isn't funny anymore. - Look, they're splitting up. You two go after Sai, and we'll go after Lili. - Then whoever ends up with the staff will grab it. - Great idea! Until then I sure hope they like chickens in Zahramay Falls. - Ba-caw! - Whoa, whoa! - Well, things definitely can't get any weirder than this, right? - Whoa! - [bawks] [chickens clucking] - Zain, come back! - Whoa there, Zain. It's all right. It's just a chicken. She won't hurt you. Things must not be going so well in Rainbow Zahramay, because this is a lot of chickens. Zac: Chickens happen. [chickens clucking] They happen a lot. - We need that staff! both: [chittering] - Oh, no! [both chirping] Leah: Lili, Sai, stop! - Oh no, not the yellow water, too. Shimmer: Here comes the yellow mist. [both chirping] - And here comes Lili and Sai. - Quick, let's grab the staff before anything weird... Ugh. ...happens. - Good try, sis. - [gasps] They're headed for the orange gate! And that's the last one! [both chirping] [loud rumbling, frantic chirping] - What's happening now? - They shut all the Rainbow Gates. And now the water is trapped inside the giant genie bottle. We need to find a way to let it out, or the bottle will break. - Lili, Sai... [both chirping] It'll be okay. We could fix this if you bring us the staff. [both chittering] [chicken clucks] [sad chirping] - Uh-oh. - [gasps] My staff, it's broken! [sad chirping] Oh, how are we gonna fix things now? - Guys, I think I have an idea. Look, the Rainbow Gate's tower is shaped like a giant genie bottle. So if we pull the top off... - Then every color of Rainbow Water will pour out at once. - And magic will work again, the way it should. - But how do we get up there? None of us can fly, except Lili and Sai. [loud rumble] - Whoa! We'd better hurry. Lili and Sai, do you wanna help? [both chirp excitedly] You guys start pulling on the stopper. Everybody else, let's bounce. [chuckles] Whoo-hoo! - All right! - Whoo! - Whoo-hoo! - Whoo! - Oh, yeah! - Whoo! - Whoo! - Whoa! all: Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! - A little higher. - Whoa! - Uh-oh. We're still too far away. - Not for long. Grab a star. Ahh! - Whoa! - Whoa! [all groan] - Okay, everybody, push on the stopper, so we can let out the Rainbow Water that's trapped inside. [all groaning] [excited chirping] Imma: Look! The Rainbow Water is back. Is the magic working again? - Let's find out. both: It's working! - Girls, you did it! All the colors are back again. Shimmer: And the weird magic is going away, too! - Whoo-hoo! - Yeah! - Whoo-hoo! - Whoo-hoo! - Thanks for your help, Lili and Sai. [both chirping] - And now that the magic's working again, we can fix your staff, Imma. - I wish Imma's staff wasn't broken anymore. - Boom Zahramay. First wish of the day. Shimmer and Shine, wish granted divine. - My staff! Oh, I'll never lose you again. Thanks, you guys. - You're welcome. - Happy to help. - Now come on, we better go check on Zahramay Falls. - Yeah! - Good idea. [upbeat music] Shimmer: Great, the falls are back to normal. - Quick, to the marketplace. - Well, Zain, I guess we'll just have to get used to this new Zahramay Falls. [chicken clucks dramatically] [chickens clucking] - [sighs] My carpet, it's working. I can flyyyy! - Oh! - [crows excitedly] - Genie-tastic! The girls saved Zahramay Falls. - It happens, happens a lot. - Princess Samira. - We did it. - We fixed the Rainbow Water. - I knew you could. - We couldn't have done it without Imma. - And I couldn't have done anything without you girls. You should spend more time in Rainbow Zahramay. - Can we do that? - I think you've proven you can handle it. There are lots of Zahramazing places to explore in Rainbow Zahramay. - Hey, Princess, can we go too? - I still don't know, Zac. I don't think we're ready. What if there are scary things beyond the falls? - Then I'm sure you'll find the courage to face them. - All right, you hear that, Kaz? We're going to Rainbow Zahramay. - Yeah, I think we can do it. Right, Zain? - [squawks] - I guess Zain has to think about it. [laughter]
