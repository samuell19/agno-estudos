THE HOT MONTH OF AUGUST RHODES POLICE STATION It was foolish of me travelling A Class while running out of money. But then, I've always been like this. I couldn't change that. Even today, I would do the same thing. I was returning to my island a defeated man and A Class sort of sweetened in me the impression... that I had lost all hope of ever going back to Athens, all hope of securing a place for myself... in this huge city. Well, if Elpis hadn't told me I wouldn't have recognized you. - How are you? - You've been away long? - Yes, for military service. - In the navy no doubt. A Rhodes man? - No, an interpreter. - Oh good. And now you're on leave? - No, my service has just ended. - Then I'm wishing you a fine career! God, how foolish of me! I haven't let you speak a word to each other. How are you, Jason? I'm fine. And you? I've always waited for a letter from you. A couple of words, a postcard even. We used to be friends, remember? Why did you get a haircut? I remember your braids down to your waist. Oh but we're "misses" now, my son. Hope you don't mind my calling you son. Oh yes, we're "misses" now, we finished high school, too. - Shall we sit somewhere? - No, thanks. We only came up to watch the sea a little. But we'll see you tonight at the ball, shall we? Because you will be our escort tonight. - I'll be happy to. Very nice seeing you again and I wish you achieve something grand in life. - Then we'll see you tonight? - But of course. Elpis! I didn't only mean that. I shouldn't be disheartened. I may have failed in Athens but in Rhodes I am always somebody. Little Elpida... The skinny one with the braids. She would torture a piano all summer long. Her father's soap factory by the beach. Her house, with the wide garden. Mom's got me in her sights as a son-in-law. She wished me luck with my career. I must drink to Mom. Costas. - Are you talking to me? - Costas. I don't understand. What'll you have? A... All right... Costas! Two ouzos, please. The first thing to know about barmen is their first name. We haven't introduced ourselves. Makris. Filippou. - From Rhodes? - Yes. Going to Rhodes on vacation? - Me? No. And yet you have such a perfect tourist look! Your air, the photo camera... - Nah... I'm coming to Rhodes to work. What do you do? How shall I put it? I offer my sentimental services to members of the opposite sex of a certain age. You mean to say... Quite right. A professional. What's the big surprise? I don't know... You're saying this with no shame... ...not trying to hide it... - Aah, nonsense. We are both so young, in our age we should understand one another. A refill? - Yes, thanks. Costas, two more, please. Tell me... How did it happen, I mean... How did you start? I was studying medicine in Paris. But my old man in Kalamata got tired of paying my monthly rent year after year so... one day he stopped sending me money. Therefore I found out that the best way to avoid going back was those American old hags with their bags full of traveller's cheques. Then I got used to it. Cannes, Geneva, St. Moritz. And why did you return to Greece? Greece is in fashion lately. Especially now that we joined the Common Market I thought I should work in my homeland. And I chose Rhodes as a starting point. I still don't understand. Oh come on, now. You're exaggerating. What exactly don't you understand? - All of it. How is it done? I'll tell you. But instead of explaining to you why don't I give you a tiny sample of my work? Of course, I've been specializing in ladies... of a certain age... But I'll make a effort just for you. The first of forty reasons why a married woman travels alone without her husband is this one. That she has definitely and irreparably got tired of him. And the remaining 39 reasons? Would you care to listen to them one by one or do you prefer the gist? I'm an impatient human being so the gist would be fine. What will she substitute him with? Are you the merchandise or... ...the travelling salesperson... with the samples? Then the lady is interested in... Is the lady interested in... Whatever the lady is interested in, she can get it herself. You hear that? It's you she wanted. Well, you know something? This little dame gave me an idea. How about us two working as a duo? No, that's out of the question. Why? I'm telling you, it is out of the question. First night away from Athens. The poor provincial young man must go back and bury himself in his island. However... I so much want to go back... So much... Makris is offering me a way. Little Elpida with her father's factory is another way. I prefer this ethical marriage. But... I'm also sorry for this little girl and the sorrow I'll give her one day when she learns the real reason why I married her. The sinful serpent is slithering up the apple tree. Let me postpone my career plans for tomorrow and let temptation overtake me tonight to the point of losing my soul. I thought you would leave. I'll do what I want, when I want it. If I were you I wouldn't do this... ...now. The next day I was overwhelmed with joy seeing the island again. Optimism took over. A feeling which I had forgotten for too long. Makris went to work. I don't know why but I had taken to him. I wished I'd had the courage to wish him luck. Mrs. Ligeri invited me to their house. She says she hopes I'll be taking my swims in their company. I don't know if I'll accept yet. As for the mysterious lady I couldn't see her anywhere. She probably continued on her voyage. So, Jason, my son, What are your plans now? Your thoughts? Dunno, father. I have no idea, yet. Let the boy rest a while. I never meant he should go to work tomorrow. I'm asking as a father. One step at a time. One step... Not sure if I should tell you but I think I'm expecting good news. Out with it now. It's nothing certain, so hold your horses. Spyros who worked in Land Registry died and they'll hire someone new. I got friends, acquaintances. I'll pull every string possible so that you get that job. - What job is that? - A copyist, for a start. What else? But with the years passing and if you're good and disciplined you may even become a Land Registrar. - Land Registrar of Rhodes! - Yes, just as you say it. Father, don't do anything yet. Let me think a little. Jason, my son. Something's troubling you which I cannot understand. You're searching for something. Let's drop it, now, father. We'll talk again. I'm going for a walk. - Better get some fresh air. Mother? What's the Ligeris' family repute? Their daughter especially? A fine family. They're rich. Their daughter's an only child. - A fine dowry, that is. - I didn't mean that. That's what I asked, though. I have to decide what I'm going to do. I admire Makris because he has the strength to say it. Because he can afford to be a professional. I am nothing. I don't have the strength to become anything. Not even a Land Registrar of Rhodes. Land Registrar of Rhodes... Not that. Definitely not that. I believe the best solution is little Elpida. Yes. But I need to get organized. I have to make a plan. I must succeed. I allow myself a month's time. No more than that. A whole month. By the end of this month I must have succeeded. And tomorrow... ...begins the hot month of August. Help me. Help me up. Julia, my child, have you seen Elpida? She's over there, swimming with Jason. Swimming where? Please, call her for me. She's been in the water too long. Jason, Elpida! Come out here! They're calling us. I'll race you out. Elpida, honey, come have some orange juice. In a minute, mom. Why didn't you race me? - I didn't feel like it. No reason. Let's join in with them. Give me the racquet. Come on, give it. Go, fetch the ball. You? Excuse me. Won't be a minute. I'd like to apologize for our last meeting. I looked around for you but didn't find you. I'm staying here, in Manesis' villa. - Alone? - Yes. You see, I don't have the chance of being with... friends. Oh, them? They're a crowd I usually try to avoid. You know... A new club's opened. It's called "Seashell". All right. Would you like us to go out tonight? But I've told you already. 9 o'clock. Jason! I must be going now. At nine, then. I'd never believe you've been married for 7 years. You're so young. I got married when I was still in college. And your husband? He comes and goes. I see him for a while and then he disappears. Now he's in Germany. You know him? No, I give you my word. I met him on the ship just before you saw us together. Perhaps it's too much? It stings. No. 3 drops like every night. Now stand still. There. - Good evening. - Good evening, my son. Going out? Yes. Father... I still owe you an answer, don't I? You owe me nothing. All that discussion, I made it for you. Yes, I know. I need another two or three days, then I'll give you an answer. I'll wait. This is Mr. Filippou. Jason, this is my husband. - How do you do. - How do you do. Please, sit. - Is he a friend of yours? - No, a chance encounter. What is your occupation, Mr. Filippou? Right now, nothing. I mean, I've just finished military service. But I had a job proposal and I'll accept. - What job? - In the Land Registry of Rhodes. Jason, what are you talking about? With this job you'll bury yourself here. My dear, you don't know the difficulties young people are faced with today. Right, Mr. Filippou? Well, I didn't mean here in Rhodes. If he should come to Athens... if one should help him... Of course. Provided all that, I don't believe you'll face any difficulties, Mr. Filippou. Since you're... my wife's protege. Excuse me, dear, but I've had an exhausting trip so I'll go back home and lie down. I hope Mr. Filippou will stay and keep you company. Tomorrow my wife and I shall go swimming with the motorboat. We invite you to join us in this excursion. We will thus be given the chance of examining your problem in large. Good night. But I'll be leaving shortly, too. Sit down, why did you get up? I don't get the way he treated me. Like some gift he's offering you. - We need to talk. - What's to talk about? Don't you see why he came back? He is surely having us watched. They contacted him in Germany and he came back. You don't know what a sinister man he is. I see the malice in his eyes. Surely he's hatched a plan to put into action. Jason, I'm scared. - Don't worry. I won't leave you alone. - I'm scared, Jason. Recently, I've felt as if he's determined to do something evil. Now I am sure the time has come. I'll stand by you. I'll do anything you ask. We must not separate. It'll be like admitting our guilt. We must stay together until he unmasks himself. In the meantime, we must find the one who told on us. So that's it! Our dove has found her mate. Well, you've done excellently. I was right to pick you out in Paris. Only... I imagined things to be different. I thought that she wouldn't be able to resist your charm. Now it's all over. So... what is your plan? A photographer partner of mine is waiting 24 hrs a day in room 67 of The Excelsior Hotel. The password is "Cafe Bonaparte". He'll come at once. He'll deliver the negatives to you, he'll get paid and you'll never see him again. He doesn't know -and he never will- who you are. Great! Well-done! Very nice work. Thank you. I won't need you anymore. You can go back to Athens. - But it's not over... - No, no, no. I won't. I'll take it from here. You can go back tomorrow morning. Then perhaps I could... get paid? Of course. I don't want to remind you again, that you and I have never met. But you did remind me. To make sure you won't forget it. Don't walk me home, I'd better go alone. OK, I'll stay here. Now don't you worry. I'll do whatever you want. Everything you ask me to. Finally, it all comes to an end. Yes, tomorrow night. Listen, he's sending me back to Athens. - But you won't go. - I will, listen. - How is it possible... - Let me explain. I'll go. It's better if I do. I'll take a flight tomorrow and do my best to attract attention. He gave me a cheque to cash in Athens. Then I'll catch the afternoon flight under a false name and return unnoticed. I won't go to a hotel. I'll come here, in your garden. We'll meet here at ten tomorrow to arrange the last details. Got anything to say? All right. One more long day alone with him. You will have Filippou to protect you. What do you mean? Why the long face? Listen to me. Wasn't the whole plan yours from the start? Wasn't it your suggestion to drag him away from Athens? Didn't you insist on finding someone as a bait? Didn't you choose him yourself on the ship? Speak up! Didn't you? Yes but I can't bear the thought of him holding you, see? - Darling, it's only one more day. - I can't stand it. I can't. Yes... Now. Here... Now... Thanks. I never drink in the morning. What else have you forbidden yourself to do in the morning? I don't understand what you mean. Young man, don't misunderstand me. You must have already heard what they say about my class. That it has two pros. One: a right sense of humour, And two, that its women make love perfectly. Don't you agree? You look like a reader. You must know him. I'm talking about Kalvos. Know him? Yes. "The sun in orbit circular, like a spider enshrouded me... in light and death... incessantly... in light and death." Mr. Fokas... If you don't mind, I'd like to... Swimming time! - Mr. Fokas, what's wrong? - My leg! Leave it! Leave it to me! Leave it alone. We must get back. I'll have to see the X-rays tomorrow to get the whole picture, I can tell you, however, that it's nothing serious. A maximum of ten days in that chair should suffice. I'm sorry I cannot have a nurse sent over tonight but I promise I will tomorrow by all means. Good night. I'll walk you downstairs. Good night. Listen. Serve dinner when I tell you. Leave it. Martha... Where were you? I thought you weren't coming. - Everything goes as planned. - No, today he got drunk and fell. He's broken his leg and is in a wheelchair now. He can't walk. - Then it all goes awry. - No, we can't lose this chance. I thought of something. He's on the first floor. The staircase is high. If he slipped with his chair and fell, it'd be the ideal accident. - Yes, but how? - Listen. I'm expecting Filippou tonight. I'll tell him to meet me at midnight by the motorboat. It's Teta's night off so he'll be home alone. No one knows you're here. As for my reputation of having a lover... I don't really give a damn what they'll think of Mrs. Fokas. It's good alright but there's something yet missing. What was he doing alone on the staircase after midnight? What brought him there? We must wrap the package up neat. What if a thief... A thief? Go on. When the maid leaves we'll be up at the veranda. I'll leave the door open for you. Walk up to the bedrooms and take everything you find. The watch, the jewellery, whatever. Go down to the dock and put them in the boat. When I meet Filippou later I'll dump them in the ocean somehow. They'll all blame a thief. That's good. But, Martha... Listen to me. You know how much I love you. Why won't you listen to me for the last time? Why do we have to do this... Why not throw him out? The fortune is yours anyway. Say no more. We've been through all that. I hate him. He must pay for all the years of youth he stole from me. Only a month after marrying me he was out with whores shamelessly Humiliation and shame kept me locked inside for 7 years. Why let him go now with a large bonus, too? No, I cannot be happy when he's happy too. No. You have to decide. Either we do as we planned or you go away and leave me. Now. You know I am on your side. It'll all go as planned. - I must go now. - Don't forget to leave the door open. Jason. Good evening, how is Mr. Fokas? He's better, thank you. Oh, hello Mr. Filippou. Good evening, sir. How's your leg? Much too superficial a wound to trigger a conversation. Help me. Well... let's drink to something. But what shall we drink to? I suggest we should drink to Martha's beauty. They say it's internal mood that at times makes a face exceptionally beautiful. And tonight your mood, my love, must be so beautiful as your face is. So, Mr. Filippou, let's drink to my wife's beauty. Well-done, girl. You're just on time. I'll be back in a minute. Ah, Mr. Filippou I ascertain some indiscrepancy in your thoughts. Don't look like that. I don't mean anything serious. It's just that today you said that you never drank in the morning. But now I see that you never drink in the evening either. Then let us drink to Mr. Filippou's health, him being so kind as to... keeping members of the Fokas' family company when they're bored. Who can it be? Some cat, perhaps. Mr. Filippou! Come now, sit. Don't inconvenience yourself. It was most probably a cat. Let us trust in my wife's intuition. Besides, thieves are but a bourgeois attempt of justifying the existence of the police. Now if you'll excuse me I think I will retire. I should be going, too. Good night. - Good night. I'll walk you downstairs. I need to see you tonight, Jason. Not tonight, Martha. Not in his house, I can't. Don't leave me alone. You promised me. But... If not here, then come to the motorboat, down at the port, at midnight. Not tonight, Martha. Better not tonight. Don't leave me alone, Jason. I only have you, now. All right, I'll be there. At midnight. I can see you needn't pretend any to persuade him. Let's stifle our nerves a bit. Don't you see I'm pretending to persuade him? Did you get the jewellery? - Yes, I did. Where's the phone connection? - The plug is in the kitchen. We better take all the measures we can. Hello? We have to wait till midnight. Jason! Jason? Did you come for me? No, I didn't realize I was at your house. Why are you out at this hour? I came out for a walk. I couldn't sleep. It's so hot. I suddenly saw you and thought you might be looking for me. What's new? Not a thing. - Elpida... - Don't say anything. Rhodes is a tiny little place. I know everything. I don't want to tell you any excuses or lies... I'm in a bit of a mess. For two weeks now I feel I'm not moving on solid ground. Dunno what's happening to me. Jason, I don't think anyone would see you if you jumped in here. Come and let's talk. It's twelve. Martha, look out! Fokas is upstairs, in the veranda. Mr. Fokas, I want to ask you a question. Who invited Filippou here? My wife. But I was very glad to receive him myself. He's a very likeable young man. Then you mean that you didn't know Filippou before. What's that supposed to mean? My wife's acquaintances are mine, too. Mr. Fokas, what kind of a relationship did Filipou have with your wife? Enough! I won't allow any more of this! I'm sorry, sir. I'm facing up to all sorts of possibilities. - The doctor's here. - Tell him to wait. So then, tell me what happened once more. This is the third time I'm repeating this. Supper was over and Filippou left. I felt like reading a little before my sleep. So I asked my wife to get everything ready and then come and help me to bed. She was out for a few minutes. And suddenly I heard her voice. She was crying "help" at the top of her lungs. At the same time I also heard the shots. I went out to the hall as fast as I could. It was dark. I heard a sound coming from the library. It was the constable entering. I know nothing else. The district attorney's here, Sir. Have you made a list of the jewellery and your missing items? I'm making it now. Go on. I'll see you shortly. Doctor, I'd like a responsible and straightforward answer from you. Can Fokas walk? Impossible in my opinion. He has a fibula fracture. Even his moving around in the chair would be very difficult few days ago. Only under the influence of very strong emotion he might manage some noteworthy result. - Thanks. That's all for tonight. You're welcome. Good evening. Good evening, Vassilis. You don't look very happy that I'm here. We're friends and we speak our minds freely, right? I'm in need of promotion. I've been waiting for a chance like this for years and now you're here to steal it away from me. Listen, Vassili. It isn't so. That's not why I came. I am here to help you. This is a tricky one, you must be careful. Fokas is not your typical peasant. He's one of the ten most powerful people in the country. Tomorrow's headlines in Athens will only read about this. You must be careful. I know. You know who did it? I'm in no hurry. I know. That youth, Filippou. Shall we go? I'll stay here. Elpida? There are a few things I have to tell you. Don't go on. I know them. So much time has gone by. It is all too far behind in my memory. I am so peaceful near you. Shall we go swimming tomorrow? Tomorrow and every day. Now I must send you away. I don't want to make Mom sad. - Your father? - He's on a trip to Athens. Let's go. - Good evening. - What's the problem, officer? Please, don't be alarmed. We just need your son to answer a few questions for us. - But coming here at night... - Mr. Filippou, please stop! Listen. Don't make things worse for your son. Go to your room and wait. Madam, please go ahead. - He's coming. - Remember what I said, OK? - Are you not in bed? - Oh, the boy was real busy. - The boy's here to tell us all... - But we know it all already... Yes, Filippou, we know everything. So, talk! - Easy now, he'll tell us. - I don't understand... - He's making fun of us... - And we're so gentle... - Speak up, boy! - About what? I've no idea... - Stop lying, talk! - I don't know anything. - Talk! - I don't know anything! Take him. Jason! You can tell me, son. What did you do? What do they want? At least you can believe me. I don't know what they want. I haven't done anything! Do you believe me? Yes, my son. Filippou, now let's cut the act and take things from the beginning. And first of all, where have you hidden the things you stole? - What goes on in there? - Interrogation has just started. What do you say? Will the boy keep us till morning? Much more. He won't break that easy. Lies! I know nothing about the things you're saying. It's all lies! Let's start all over again. Where did you meet Mrs. Fokas? On the ship. The man who... We met on the ship. Now hold it, hold it. You started saying something. What man? There was someone else on the ship. The three of us met by chance. What's his name? Where is he now? Makris, I think... He's staying at the Excelsior. - What goes on in there? - He snitched on someone. I'll get him. I don't get it, Filippou. You're not talking clearly. What kind of a relationship did you have with her? - She was my mistress. - You got no shame? - It's true. She was. Your mistress, eh? Not only you killed her but now you defame her, too. It's the truth. I'm sorry about what happened to Mrs. Fokas. Sorrier than all of you. But what I'm saying is true. She invited me here tonight. She told me to go to the dock at midnight. You don't say! So she arranged a rendezvous with you for midnight! Yes. She told me to come back to the house later... but because ...he... was here, I didn't accept. So she suggested we met at the dock round midnight. You don't say! You didn't accept at home because of the husband's presence but you did accept the dock, right? - Yes, right. - And you went? - No. - Why not? I changed my mind. No reason why. And where did you go? You left here at 11.30 and reached home at 2.30. Three full hours. Where were you? - Nowhere! - I was walking around. - Where? Whom did you see? Who saw you? In three hours you must have seen somebody. I never took notice. I was distracted. You know what I'd like now? I'd like to be your father for five minutes. To give you a good thrashing and then some. You get the point. Good evening! If you stood in line we'd say "good morning". Filippou, I've been much too patient. For you. Because you're young and I wanted to help you. So that you would tell us yourself where you hid the stolen goods. - I told you I don't know. - Enough with all that. You should consider yourself, your father. But you don't! You needn't go on. I don't need your help. I'll find the stolen goods myself. As for the rest, I know your entire plan from the start. How you met Mrs.Fokas aboard, how you organized the trick and how you asked her to go down to the dock. You expected her to be there, so the house would be empty and Fokas would be in his room helpless. But she naturally didn't come and that was her fatal mistake. What is it? That man Makris flew to Athens yesterday morning. They told me he's the kind who baits old hags. He left with a rich American one. Tell me, Filippou... Did you know what Makris' job was? Yes. He was... So you knew. Take him. I don't like it, Vassili. - Why? - I don't know. I just don't get it. I don't like it. He serves as a military officer. He comes home, meaning to do something with his life. He's smart, handsome... His father's an honest working man... Why would he steal? Or kill? I dunno. I don't understand it, I don't like it. Then you can have him as your son-in-law. - No jokes, I told you my opinion. - All right, I heard it. You haven't got anywhere, though. I can see you got him on a string. But you have to find the stolen goods. You have to prove ownership of the pistol. That's coming, as well. I've wired the number and I'm sure I'll get a good answer. - I hope so. Yet, something in me... I want you to do me a favor. Suppose... it's not Filippou. Suppose it is Fokas. Isn't that what you thought? - Go on. If it is Fokas, why would he do it? For money... or for power? Suppose it is so. The fortune is the victim's dowry from her father. Fokas was only an export agent when she married him. I want us to send a telegram to Athens. Have central police get access to the woman's will. We'll sign this together. I want us to share the responsibility. Fokas is a man of much power and I fear his anger when he hears... that I suspect him of murdering his wife. All right. We'll sign it together. Babis, get me some tea, this cold's pestering me. Why don't you take a Kalmaline? You have a telegram from Athens headquarters. - Where's Fokas? - In the dining room. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Excuse me, I'm in the middle of... Will you have some coffee? - No, thank you. So, what news are you bringing me? Filippou hasn't confessed yet, but... he won't take long, I believe. - Is that all? - No. You know... we are compelled to consider everything... cover ourselves against all possibilities... surely you understand. - Of course. I asked for the opening of your wife's will in Athens. The answer is here. I apologize for this indiscretion during the performance of my duty. Have a nice day. Listen. Can we leave? Well, I mean... I'm taking my wife to Athens, to our family grave. Can we leave? I don't know. The district attorney... I can't stay in this house anymore. I want to return to Athens. I have many acquaintances there, but... I wouldn't like to force you... you understand. Well? Shall I phone for an airplane? Yes... yes. You phone for the airplane to come and I'll see the district attorney soon. Thank you. Have a nice day. FOKAS INHERITS NOTHING STOP FORTUNE FALLS TO INSTITUTIONS Don't forget Martinos! - Good morning, Mrs. Ligeri. - Good morning. It's very urgent that I speak to you. Today it is a little difficult, you see... Please, officer, what I have to say will interest you. - But... - Please, officer. Please, let's go to my office. Go ahead, Miss. Papadopoulos! Bring Martinos in 5 minutes. Sit down, please. You, too, Miss. I'm real sorry her father's away. I wired him to come back immediately. - What exactly is the matter? - Mother... Last night... Jason spent the whole night with me. Filippou? Yes. Miss Ligeri, be very careful of what you're going to say. You're endangering yourself. - You needn't tell me anything. I understand. What do you mean when you're saying "Last night, the whole night"? We dined around ten. Then I went to bed. But I couldn't sleep. I went for a walk in the garden. Then, Jason happened to pass by. We talked. I invited him to jump over the fence and join me in the garden. We sat there for a long time. I cannot recall how long. When he left I went to bed. But again I couldn't sleep. Soon it was dawn. Miss Ligeri, what's your relation to Filippou? We love each other. - Elpida! - Please, mother. - What will her father say about this! - Mrs. Ligeri. I'm afraid your daughter's fallen victim to Filippou. Don't interrupt me! Unfortunately, I cannot reveal secrets of the interrogation. I can only say, that he absolutely was in need of an alibi. And he used you to cover himself on that aspect, too. Papadopoulos! Please make a formal statement of all you said to me. Could I possibly see him? It's difficult. - Just for a few minutes. - I'm sorry, it's impossible. - Is this an emergency flight? - It's for Fokas and his wife. The month of August is over. The month I had set as a deadline for myself to become something. To have gained something in this world for myself. And now... I'm finding myself ruined... by some power which I cannot possibly... or anyhow save myself from. I am doomed, condemned... and I cannot see any chance of salvation anywhere. I'll tell you everything. I'm sorry, Vassili. Call the control tower of the airport of Athens. I hope Fokas' airplane hasn't yet landed. My order is they turn it back to Rhodes. I'm setting Filippou free the soonest possible. Vassili. I'm sorry. Rhodes? Yes, it's landing right now. Your order will be executed at once, Commander. Go back? Certainly. I'll keep it on the airfield. Jason! English subs by never4ever (Hot month of) July 2020
