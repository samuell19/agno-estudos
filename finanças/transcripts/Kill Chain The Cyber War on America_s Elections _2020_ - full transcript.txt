There are many, many, many counties in the United States. Within the counties, it's then left to the election officials in those counties, and they get to decide how we vote. They get to decide what machines we use, and there are many different kinds of election machines. Halpern: Then the memory card is placed into the voting machine. Some places also use paper ballots, and all of the paper ballots go into a scanner. Paper ballot here, hand-mark it, and feed it to our precinct scanner. Other districts will use what are called "direct recording electronic machines," which are touch-screen computers, and then, ultimately, all of these votes will go into a central location that will tabulate the votes. So, at the end of the night, when you close the machine down from voting, there's a thumb drive...

Whether it's a card or whether it's a USB stick, it doesn't matter... it's still a removable storage medium. Every single step of the way, it is vulnerable to attack.

They do the early voting operation. This... This company, if it had been hacked, it had the potential to really impact on Florida elections. VR Systems sells what are called electronic poll books, which are software or hardware or both, that have digitized the voter databases that are used to verify who is a legitimate voter and who's not. And VR Systems are responsible for the poll books in almost every county in Florida. I think there's 67 or 68 counties, and they had sold poll books in 64 of them. They also sell them around the country. They're in eight states. Hursti: In this case, the vendor was VR Systems. Maybe the vendor was the first target, but it's not the real target. The real target was the jurisdictions of the customers. Michael Daniel: If what the bad guys wanna do is hack into the voting process, then they might target voter registration databases because they are open to the Internet by definition. Like if you want people to be able to register online, they have to be open to the Internet, so you can get to them. The other thing is that with a voter registration database, imagine you go in and you flip the second and third digits of everybody's address, so that, now, when they show up to the polls, their ID does not match their address on file in the voter registration database. It's virtually impossible to detect by eye, so a human's not gonna notice it, and yet, you could cause a lot of chaos at the polls. CBS North Carolina's Jonathan Rodriguez joins us live from Durham. It's been a very busy day of voting here. We're here at the Bethesda Ruritan Club, where people can go out and vote. It started a little bit rocky for voters out here, and it's all due to a technical glitch. Normally, when you go inside here, they would get on a computer and get your name and your information to see who's voting, right? Well, that's the system that had a glitch and required them to go back to paper polling, the old-school way of doing it. William Barber: Durham County was ordered to go to the paper poll books and to shut down the computers.

Quite frankly, all election officials in America were clueless of what was going on. In fact, we heard nothing until a national security subcontractor -called Reality Winner. -Hursti: Mm-hmm. Sancho: Reality Winner ran across a report from National Security, detailing how the attacks were done around the states in the United States of America. This was considered top secret... and no election official -in the country knew about it. -Hursti: Mm-hmm. It was about a year later before the states that were actually attacked by the Russians were able to hear and know it was the Russians doing it. We should never have that. Newsman: Barely one hour after The Intercept, an online news site, posted a story about a top-secret US government document on Russian hacking, the Justice Department said a 25-year-old Georgia woman, Reality Leigh Winner, had been arrested for leaking it. Billie Winner: The document that she leaked was the actual proof that the Russians had attempted to hack into our voting software. She was trapped in a world where she was going to work every day at the NSA, and the news was conflicting with the proof that was right on her computer screen. She was basically releasing information that we were under attack. Michael Daniel: Based on the volume and the level of activity that we had seen, I had no reason to believe that the Russians hadn't tried to access some kind of voter system in all of the states. That was really a moment where we realized, like, that this was, uh, a very large-scale operation beyond anything that we had really, I think, anticipated up to that point. Reality Winner will now serve more than five years in prison. That's the longest sentence ever imposed for this kind of violation. Sancho: I think she's a heroine for releasing that information because, until that moment, we did not know the extent of this operation. She's got a minimum of a five-year sentence that she's serving in federal prison. But that's not gonna prevent an attack on our system or ensure that our votes are being counted. The American government was caught off guard. The election systems were caught off guard in 2016. In a way, it was a failure of imagination on our part, because if we look back at the Russian military doctrines that were outlined in 2011 by General Gerasimov, who was the equivalent of the Russian Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he said in 2011 that Russia could not compete with the West in tanks and trucks and planes and bullets. But they could compete in the area of cyber and misinformation, disinformation, and sowing dissension. And what better way to sow dissension than to corrupt an election process? Lankford: I serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and I can tell you every single country in NATO has had Russian interference in their elections, every one of them. The campaign of centrist Emmanuel Macron claims it suffered a massive and coordinated 11th-hour cyber attack, with leaked documents designed to destabilize tomorrow's runoff election. Newsman: Analysts say Putin wants to work against Macron to tilt the election toward his favorite candidate, the far-right populist Marine Le Pen, who wants to bring France out of NATO and the EU. Newswoman: The day before the Ukrainian presidential election results were announced, a hacker group calling themselves CyberBerkut infiltrated Ukraine's central election computer systems. According to Ukraine officials, if the malicious software they installed had not been discovered and removed, it would've portrayed that ultra-nationalist Right Sector leader Dmytro Yarosh had won with 37 percent of the vote, instead of the one percent he actually received. Moderate Petro Poroshenko, the actual winner with a majority of the vote, would've been placed in second with 29 percent. That evening, Russian Channel One aired a bulletin declaring Mr. Yarosh the winner, quoting these exact percentages. Douglas Lute: We are more vulnerable to this kind of subtle, hard-to-attribute attack than we are to tanks, airplanes, and ships.

Man: Our dedication is to the absolute highest standards of accuracy, security, and reliability. We believe in honesty, commitment, trust, and respect. Stauffer: And when ES&S discovered that we were not using their testing plan, they were appalled. When we used our own testing plan and found these vulnerabilities, they pretty much told us that they had their own team and that they were not interested.

How can a vendor sell a voting system with this many vulnerabilities? And I just can't find a straight answer.

And they are simply picking up a ready-made box, and building the application by using these blocks, and not that careful. Because people are only looking, "Is it functional?" And I think that's probably one of the issues that the vendors are having is that they don't know what they have in those systems. They don't know what code is in those systems. They just make it work, and they sell it. We should know every single line of code that is in that software.

The fact that it's the first option it's offering is kind of interesting. A commonly used argument that these machines are safe from hacking because they are never connected to Internet.

Local area network can always be connected to Internet, so the reality here is once you are connected to network, you don't know where the network is. What else is connected to the Internet? That is the problem of the network. Election offices think that connected to Internet is dangerous only when it's within an election cycle. Actually, in many cases, it has been found that barriers are lowered between the election cycles. Malware can infect machines between the cycles and stay dormant, waiting for the right time to activate.

This is Matt. -Hursti: Hi, Matt. -Matt: Nice to meet you. -Hursti: Yeah, I've seen you a number of times, -but only on a screen. -Halderman: Wow! Look at this. Hursti: Yeah, that was one hell of a warehouse. Halderman: Looks like a TSX. 75 bucks. Take as many as we want. All right, let's plug it in and turn it on and see what happens. -And... Aha! -(chimes) "Ballot station secure touchscreen voting terminal." What do you think the security pin is? I don't know. I mean, it used to be 1-1-1, but I know they upgraded to 1-1-1-1-1-1. (laughing) I'm sorry. That was not a joke. (laughing) Hursti: Well, these are not tight at all. No. That's... There you go. This is the slot that can sometimes be used for a modem, right? Not only modem. There's a telephone jack here, but this also can have an Ethernet network card. Ah, yes. And the other thing which is interesting is the SD slot, which not only can have an additional memory card, but also, it can be used for wireless. Oh, I forgot about this. Yeah, there's an SD slot. You showed years ago how just putting in a card with a special file name could rewrite all the software in the machine, make it do whatever you want. I mean, there are no two ways about it. This is architecturally not a safe way to cast votes, and, boy, I'm worried now more than ever about nation-state attackers, about real state-level attacks on these machines. That's true, however, I still think that the one problem with the nation-state attacks being talk is that it gives you a false sense of security, that the lone wolf and smaller guy cannot do it themselves, too. Everything we discovered, how easy it is or hackable for lone wolf, is still true, too. Halderman: Just look at this motherboard. There's so many different wires connecting to it. Each of these is a different type of input or output device. These machines want to be talking to other devices. They're built for it, and, um, that's what magnifies the threat because, ultimately, just hacking one machine, coming up to one, opening it up, resoldering it, that's not an attack that will scale. But the thing that will scale is piggybacking on the data that's being copied into the machines. That's what's going to allow an attacker to upset an election across an entire county, an entire state, an entire country. ♪ ♪ Here, I have a set of tools that I've built for vote-stealing software, and it can piggyback on the normal pre-election processes... -...to get to every voting machine. -Hursti: Yep. Hursti: You also have here the actual -software driving the printer. -Halderman: Right. It completely controls the paper summary tapes, the things it prints at the end of elections that have the totals. So, an attacker can program the machine to print out whatever they want even to just completely disregard the election results. And then the code to run the machine and the printer gets delivered to every voting machine along with the ballot programming. What is your estimation, how many hours it took... -...for you to create a tool set? -Oh, this was just part-time over a couple of months. Certainly more than, I think, people could do in a long weekend, but not something that -requires nation-state level effort either. -Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Halderman: Let's go. ♪ ♪ (indistinct chattering) Professor Matt Blaze: Hello, everybody! Welcome to the voting village! We have a variety of voting machines available here. One of the reasons we're doing this is to broaden the community of people who are gonna be experts in how voting machines work. -Harri, do you wanna say a few words? -Hursti: Yes. Every voting machine in this room is in use in next elections, every single one, every single model is a model still in use. We are actually asking your help because we don't know much about those devices. Basically, the idea here is all the machines are there to be tested, to be used. You can open it. Don't break all of them, but if something breaks, that's fine. They are bought from eBay, and they do have the previous election in. If you see something, say something! Tell what you found! Every discovery, every information you have, please let them know, so that we can inform people what you have discovered and what you have found. We are here to help, so that you can have fun and explore and discover new things. Thank you. -Man: Thank you. -(applause, cheers) Moss: So, at Def Con, we're always a really open conference. We knew, even though we were some, you know, sketchy hackers, the manufacturers were gonna wanna know what's going on. So, instead of creating an adversarial relationship, we know you're gonna try to be there, let's just invite you. We're doing this thing, you might not like it, but come and participate. Tell us why we're wrong. Bring your latest equipment if we're testing the wrong equipment. Get some free consulting. I mean, you've got some of the world's best hackers. Maybe this is a free test. Maybe you can get some advice out of it. And nobody took us up on the offer. Hursti: This is the first time we have a public to be able to experience and take a look into the critical spot, which has been little bit hiding in the shadow in all the previous election and voting machine security studies. Finally, for the first time, non-experts, non-having signed a non-disclosure agreement researchers are having a chance to see what these machines are like, how incredibly, trivially vulnerable they are. And what effect this is gonna have on their democracy if they don't get involved. (indistinct chattering) Trying to see if there's any obvious storage on here. Man: This is a Diebold voter registration machine, and its purpose is to just hold voter registration data, like names, addresses, social security numbers, lots of scary stuff. And the database is stored on these cards. 'Cause one of the things that you can do with these machines is install your own malware on whatever the memory media is. That will go back and infect the... back end, vote tabulating, and next year's ballot design systems for years to come because the software doesn't get upgraded. Your malware could stay there forever and no one would know it was there. (chattering) Hursti: Hackers are a wonderful resource. We make significant discoveries. So, I could put a program on there -that just modifies the count. -Man: Yes. Hursti: We are here only three days a year. The real adversaries, they run it 24/7 with massive funding. Use the display command, it will fill this screen with whatever you tell it to. If you don't believe that there is this kind of room in Russia, running 24/7, you are kidding yourself. (laughing) Schumann: We have access. We have access to the machine. Here is Microsoft Windows XP. And I'm demonstrating how you can, remotely from this laptop, gain complete control of the voting machine. I'm doing it right now. This is the prompt of the voting machine. We are in. We have made it! -Here is the directory, which is called "reports." -Hursti: Yeah. Sarah Teale: -He wirelessly got into the machine. -Yes. So, I'm connected to the machine, but I think I can take control of the screen of the machine. And so, what you can see now, if it works, it actually kind of shows me... -...this screen, Windows XP! -Man: Oh my God. I can turn the machine off from here as well, if I want to. -(laughing) -Okay. Now, I can exit the machine, and you know what's gonna happen? I am turning off the machine for them. They're gonna be very surprised. Do you want to exit the machine? Now it's disconnected, and now let's see... -...what their faces look like. -Man 1: Oh shit. -Man 2: Oh! Oh! Okay! -Man 3: I don't know what just happened. Man 4: It switched to an administrator login screen, and then it went off, and we're like, "What happened?" Because we were trying all the different smart cards to see if one of them actually did anything. -That's awesome. -(cackling) (chattering) And you can do all this all automatically. You can actually have a machine, a car that drives by the voting places and updates all of the votes, and because there's no paper evidence, the machine will actually, um... you will never, ever notice that this actually happened. This vulnerability is so trivial, the tools are so widely known, it would be easy to imagine that somebody will hack the machine from the parking lot with never seeing the voting machine. Moss: What happens is attacks only get easier. So maybe, it was a super sophisticated attack in 2016. By 2020, or 2022, it's only average, right? We gotta stay one step ahead of this. If it was the Russians yesterday, who is it tomorrow? Is it an organized crime group? Is it a political action group? Is it an environmental rights group? "Oh yeah, you can't swing the presidential election because you'd have to tamper with too many precincts." Well, okay, what if I'm just tampering with my local precinct 'cause I just wanna get my guy in? What if the skills become so widespread that you can do this on a county or state level? Then what? Maybe getting your governor is almost as important to you as getting the president, depending upon what your issue is. So, I don't wanna get so spun up that it's like an all or nothing federal thing. It's an everything thing! (indistinct chattering) I feel like we are in terrible danger of losing what it means to be a democracy. If elections can be altered subtly, they can be altered in a way that is undetectable, how does one trust the results of their election? And a democracy functions on trust. Without that trust, things descend into chaos and anarchy. Those of us who know how vulnerable, um, the voting systems are in these elections are terribly afraid right now. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Halpern: Brian Kemp is running for governor at a moment in time when he was also overseeing the elections in Georgia, i.e., he was overseeing his own election. Newswoman 1: Secretary of State Brian Kemp... Newswoman 2: The race between Brian Kemp and Stacey Abrams, -which is too close to call... -Newswoman 3: An historic race... Locked in a tight race. It couldn't be any tighter. This is a battle for the soul of our state, y'all. I got a big truck, just in case I need to round up criminal illegals and take 'em home myself. Yep, I just said that. I'm Stacey Abrams and I'm running for governor, because where you come from shouldn't determine how far you can go. Halpern: The canary in the coal mine is Georgia. Georgia is in this situation where every single person in Georgia who votes, votes on the same kind of machine, the AccuVote, which is, as we know, an extremely insecure machine that can be easily, easily hacked, and yet, it's still being used. Newsman: With his family in tow, Brian Kemp voted today at the historic Winterville Train Depot. Like most Georgians, he was voting on a machine using 16-year-old technology. After a first try in the voting booth, he came back holding the yellow voting card he'd been given and told the poll worker... It said this is an invalid card. Woman: Okay, you go back in there, I'll redo it for you. Newsman: Kemp fought against efforts earlier this year to replace the machines, saying a last-minute change to paper ballots would create chaos. Chaos, which he now says, has been avoided. Reporter: Are you concerned about the reports of problems -people are having? -No, not at all. Today, been a great, really, a smooth election. Newswoman: This is a look at lines inside Annistown Elementary in Gwinnett County, where some machines were not even working. There were some major problems here at this Gwinnett County polling place. Those voting machines, that you see right over there, stopped working earlier this morning. Some were here for three hours, others here for much longer. I wanted to come in, do my voting, and get out, and that didn't happen today. Gabe Okeye: Some people were here for five hours. By the way, this is the second largest county in the state. It's also a Democratic stronghold. What time do polls close tonight? It's supposed to close at seven, but we've received 25-minute extension, -but that's not enough. -Yeah. We're still fighting to get a full hour. There's a saying in Georgia that, "As goes Gwinnett County," which is this county... -Hursti: Yeah. -"...so goes the governorship." The secretary of state, -who's also a candidate... -Mm-hmm. ...is telling everybody that these machines are not hackable. -Mm-hmm. -That they are safe. I don't know if you knew, but I hacked that machine which is used here. -Okay, call the police. -(laughs) Hursti: No, that was long time ago. 2006, I showed how that machine can be hacked. And then they are here today, telling us... -Hursti: Yeah, 12 years later. -...it's not hackable. Twelve years later, that same machine still in use, and it's still hackable. Poll worker: -Logan Lamb: Have you all had an interesting day so far? -How's your day been? -Busy. -Marilyn Marks: Hi, Harri. Nice to see you. -Likewise, likewise. -Hi, Harri. So, the cards aren't working. That's what they tell. -DeMillo: Which shouldn't be possible, right? -I mean, that's weird. Excuse me. (indistinct chatter) Let's see... Yeah, so... Generally, I'm looking for... voters who insert their card into the machine, and it fails to work. So like, right now, that guy's having issues, so we should head him off, talk to him a bit. Excuse me, were you having issues just now? Voter: Oh, I see. Yeah, so you did change your driver's license... -Man (speaking): -Lamb: Oh, for real? Yeah. Lamb: Do you know what the error message was on that screen? Marsha: It was a warning. I don't remember exactly what it said. -It was a warning, error warning. -Okay, but it was just having -trouble writing to the card? -It wouldn't write to any of the cards. We had 24 cards... I need your driver's license, too. And none of them would work. Lamb: Okay. It just said it was something saying, "card is inserted incorrectly" or "unable to write to card." -DeMillo: Was that on a TS? -Yes, they were all TS's. Hursti: I mean, this whole thing is bizarre. I heard this same thing happen in -a number of precincts, and not only here. -Lamb: Yeah. Sounds like there's another precinct, like, two miles down the road that had the same issue. Was there no control? Didn't they test this? How it's possible that you ship up something which fails on arrival? It would be acceptable if you had one or two cards fail. -Marks: Sure. -DeMillo: So, you would have to cook the whole bag of cards in order to get that kind of failure, right? Well, I don't know -what could have been going wrong. -We put them in microwaves, and you could do that. -Hursti: Yeah. -Yeah, that's true. But I think you're right. One at a time, you get random failures on the cards. -But where did it come from? -Marks: Through ElectionNet. Secretary of State's office. Yeah. Oh, okay.

And Brian Kemp then took the lobbyist for ES&S as his chief of staff. ♪ ♪ (engine starts) Stark: So, there is a huge battle that will probably be lost in Georgia over using ballot marking devices rather than voter-marked, hand-marked paper ballots. This is really gonna be a catastrophe. It's far more expensive than hand-marked paper ballots. It is a vehicle for disenfranchisement in a number of different ways. Other than feeding corporate profits and making it easier to manipulate election outcomes, I don't really see the point. Hursti: That's what I was thinking immediately. All right, let's go play. ♪ ♪ -All right. -The Richmond-San Rafael Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge, and in a second, we'll see the San Francisco Bay Bridge. Stark: The fundamental problem with electronic voting technology is the evidence that it produces about who actually won. Most of them don't produce really convincing evidence, and the best technology for voter verifiability is hand-marked paper ballots. We need a trustworthy paper trail. In about 2007, I came up with the idea of risk-limiting audits, which are a way of providing statistical evidence that the outcome is correct, or having a large chance of correcting the outcome if it isn't correct. So, risk-limiting audits, there's a lot of misconceptions. Everybody agrees that's the way forward, but there's so much misconceptions. The risk-limiting audit relies on a paper trail. You don't have paper, then you can't do one. It's easy to do a risk-limiting audit. You just do a hand count of everything. Done. The subtlety is how to limit the risk -and keep the workload down. -Right, right. The procedure is you start looking at paper, and you keep looking at paper until you have convincing evidence that looking at all of it wouldn't change the result. So, you can think of it as, um, an intelligent, incremental recount that stops as soon as it's clear that it's pointless. And if it never becomes clear that it's pointless, it just keeps going until you've looked at all the paper. The key is that sample you choose is random. So, that's what lets you, uh, protect against any kind of error problem whatsoever, whether it's a malicious opponent, or a random machine failure, or a bug, or whatever it is, by looking at it randomly, you can guarantee -a big chance of catching it. -Right. It's a check on the tabulation in a way that is economical and efficient and accomplishes the minimum standard of verifying that the votes were tabulated accurately enough to tell who really won. ♪ ♪ Marks: Good to be here, hello. (laughter) (chuckles) Marks: In Georgia, we ended up seeing the strangest thing. In a heavily Democratic precinct, there was one machine out of a seven-machine precinct -that showed heavy Republican wins... -Mm-hmm. ...while the precinct itself, and all of the other machines, were showing heavy Democratic wins. -Hursti: Mm-hmm. -And it made us go, "Wait a minute. Something's weird about this. How could this happen?" Just on the one machine out of seven? The other six showed a Democratic majority -in every statewide contest? -Right, right. And in Georgia, and in a lot of other states, when the machines are printing tapes at seven o'clock at night when the polls close, it is a law that for purposes of transparency, that those tapes, one from every machine, be posted at the door, and so, like here, here's a photograph... It was just an end of the day dump of what was in the memory onto paper. So, it's just the final tally according to -its internal software, according to that machine. -Marks: Right. Right. And this particular tape is the one that got all of the Republican votes. ♪ ♪ It got substantially more votes for Brian Kemp, the Republican, than Stacey Abrams, the Democrat, and this was true all the way down the ballot. The Republican wins every single race -on this one machine. -Hursti: Mm-hmm. Something had to happen to cause one machine to have such different results than its neighbors. I called Philip and said, "Is this important? Is this as odd as it looks to me?" So he went to work on it with his magic statistics. -And the magic grad student, yes. -(laughter) Kellie Ottoboni: So, what we did was simulate this process, run it over and over again, saying if we had this many Democratic voters and this many Republican voters in our precinct, and we assigned them at random to machines, how likely is it that we'd get a Republican majority as great as what we saw on machine three? So we did this probably 10,000 times, and it was an astronomically small chance. Less than one in a million. ♪ ♪ Halpern: Georgia is buying new election machines for the whole state to replace the AccuVote voting machines that we know are insecure, and they are replacing them with another set of machines that are also insecure because they use bar codes, and bar codes can be hacked. The model that is their favorite choice right now is the Dominion ImageCast. Man: The ImageCast X will not permit the voter to over-vote a contest, to change... Marks: What this does is it's a touchscreen machine. The voter enters their vote, and what is spit out is a paper ballot, and their votes are encoded as bar codes. The vote itself is in that bar code. No humans I know can read bar code very well. And it's that vote that is then put into a scanner and counted. It is, again, putting a computer between the voter and his ballot. Putting a computer between a voter and his ballot is going to make sure that you don't have an auditable, reliable election. Halpern: So, even though the election officials in Georgia are paying lip service to the fact they now have a paper trail, they are creating a paper trail that, in fact, can't actually be audited. ♪ ♪ Paper ballots and risk-limiting audits are the unanimous... I can't find a single expert in the field, who believes that you can get this fixed without those two basic requirements. And the only way you get anything done in the Senate right now is if it's bipartisan. The way the filibuster rules work, you have to work across the aisle. The Secure Elections Act is a bipartisan effort to be able to try to address what were the problems that we already see. There are vulnerabilities in our system that we should pay attention to. Some are dramatic, like actually changing votes. Some are subtle, like just trying to alter a formula in a website and making that vulnerable so that people can't trust the results that they got. The Russians did this last time in 2016. It could be the North Koreans next time. It could be a domestic hacktivist group that just decides they're mad and they wanna be able to create some chaos. It doesn't have to be a foreign actor. Voting machines that do not produce a paper trail. The only record of the votes cast is a digital record, which could be hacked and which is impossible to audit reliably. That strikes me as a prescription for disaster. The most important things are to make sure we have votes recorded on paper... paper ballots, which just... cannot be changed in a cyber attack. How would you do a non-paper audit? Halderman: Senator, I think it would be basically impossible. When you and your colleagues hacked election systems, did you get caught? -Um... -Burr: Did they see your intrusion into their systems? The one instance when I was invited to hack a real voting system while people were watching was in Washington, DC, in 2010, and in that instance, it took less than 48 hours for us to change all the votes, and we were not caught. There's a number of bills that are pending before Congress, and I think some of them before this committee, on the subject of election integrity. Mr. Chairman, are we going to be marking up any of those bills on election security? Blunt: At this point, I don't see any likelihood that those bills would get to the floor if we mark them up. Why? Blunt: Same reason we couldn't get our bill to the floor last year. Durbin: Which is? Burr: I think the majority leader just is of the view that this debate reaches no conclusion. It's very important that we maintain the integrity and the security of our elections in our country. Any Washington involvement in that task needs to be undertaken with extreme care... extreme care, and on a thoroughly bipartisan basis. Mark Warner: Leader McConnell has not brought a single piece of election security legislation to the floor, even though the president's own security team has said that we're in jeopardy. We were not able to get the bill out of committee. We were not able to actually have a vote on it. Because, I assure you, if we had a vote on this legislation, whether it's at committee or on the floor of the Senate, it would pass overwhelmingly. I don't see how they explain not passing a bill to protect our election equipment. The White House, just as we were on the verge of getting a mark up in the rules committee, getting it to the floor, where I think we would get the vast majority of senators, the White House made calls to stop this. Were you aware of that? -No. -Okay, well that happened. There are plenty of Republicans in the House and the Senate who are deeply concerned about this, deeply, deeply concerned about it, as they should be, as we all should be. This is not a partisan issue. Everyone should care about this, whoever they vote for, everybody.

This is a pretty interesting and important-seeming thing. We kept reading a series of national reports about various named and unnamed state election systems or websites that were compromised or hacked, and my immediate question was: Is there any affiliation here with the Russians and the Russian actors that have been identified as being involved in the other hacks? So, I'll play this tape of the... state elections director. Josie Bahnke (on recording): Bahnke (continuing): Last week, I had a secure briefing with the FBI and DHS. We know that they were able to look at our website, but there was no breach, I guess, essentially. Herz (on recording): Is there any sense that they tried to actually, like, access anything? Bahnke: No. They wiggled on the door and moved on. Herz: Wiggled on the door, meaning they literally looked at the website, it's not like they tried to input credentials or... Bahnke: Yes, and there was an IP address. I think that's the... that's the gist of it. We got some information that seemed to indicate, pretty clearly, that there was more to the story here, and based on that, we formulated a Freedom of Information Act request, just sort of sent it off, and... Hursti: How long after election you FOIA'd these documents? Herz: More than a year. And then we got this whole package of documents. Really interesting here when you start looking what they explain. Herz: The Alaska system was compromised, but it was compromised by a completely different actor, the bad actor is named CyberZeist. And, you know, sort of linked to a Twitter account that has a sort of past history of hacking other figures. Uh, they talked about how the attacker had originated from what appeared to be the IP address of a power plant in India. State officials had had to report to the FBI, and there was more than officials here had originally led Alaskans to believe. To me, if this is the whole documentation, then there was never a proper, uh, investigation. Uh, they didn't take this seriously. This was quickly brushed over, saying, okay, it's contained, so, this is the whole problem, and we cleaned the whole problem, it's all fine. And nothing to see here, we were not hacked. ♪ ♪ Hursti: They are making a claim here that the attacker got access to the file system, and they sort of, kind of leave it there. If you have that kind of access to file system, you can simply replace files and gain control of the system. Security researchers like myself, this tells that... Whether they believe what they say themselves doesn't matter. This tells that the truth is likely to be way worse than what they're saying, clearly worse than this explanation. There was no containment in effect. ♪ ♪ CyberZeist: ♪ ♪ Hursti: What I take of this... is that... he got into that one place, and then, he deployed a tool, which he doesn't want to disc... he doesn't want to disclose that tool. That tool took him, all of a sudden, to a completely different place. And because he wants to use that tool later, he doesn't want to give any hint, um... how that jump happened. But omission of that information is not making him less credible, because he could have made a bullshit story and he didn't. (wind whistling) CyberZeist: ♪ ♪ Hursti: If you use a standardized...

Everything else is tools, tactics, technology... irrelevant. What you are really going after is the mind of your adversary. And the mind, in some cases a visual mind, sometimes a collective mind of the society. When a sufficiently large group of members of society don't anymore believe in the society, and that's where the collapse starts. It's called kill chain. Kill chain is a 2,000-year-old concept, which can be used in any kind of operation, whether it is military or organized crime or some other activity. And in kill chain, you move, step-by-step, towards your ultimate target. First, you gather intelligence. What is the landscape? After that, you analyze the intelligence, and now, you're asking yourself the question, "Who are the possible targets?" After that, it's weaponization. So, now you know against whom you are going, what tools you are using. I think the most important part of the kill chain is the paralyzation of your adversaries. And when the governments cannot assess the situation, take an action and correct it, that's when a paralyzation happens. That's really when you finish the target. ♪ ♪ The chain will go on until you break a link. Stopping them while maintaining and remain true to your values, that is the tricky part. I've told voters before to be careful what you vote on. Um, if you cannot validate it, if you cannot verify it right in front of you, then you shouldn't be voting on it, and you should be asking for a paper ballot. Use paper ballots. We can use an optical scanner to scan the paper ballots. If it turns out that an optical scanner, which is also a computer, has been corrupted in some way or hacked in some way, then we've got these paper ballots we can go back to and count them by hand. Whether it's Vladimir Putin or Harri Hursti who's attacking the machines, the only surefire way to know whether the machines are telling the truth about the election results is to do an audit, to look at the paper, and to make sure that what's on that paper matches the results that the computers are saying. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
