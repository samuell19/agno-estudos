I examined David Greenglass. I was then... a big, fat 23 years old and I sort of put the case together. I think that the death sentence imposed by Judge Irving R. Kaufman in the Atom Spy Trial had a very strong deterrent effect. I think it's been a very good year on the anti-Communist front in this country.

He didn't wanna be in McCarthy's seat being the Senator, but he wanted to be the guy behind the power brokers. Cohn: The last way to be politically ambitious as a Jewish New York Democrat, which I was and am, is by becoming counsel for Senator McCarthy, so I was hardly down there for any... political ambition. I was down there to do more in this type of work, in which I believed then, and which I believe now. Taki Theodoracopulos: Roy was a hero to many...

Some of Cohn's friends included former Mayor Abe Beame Deputy Mayor Herman Badillo, and Brooklyn Democratic leader Meade Esposito.

Lane: On talk shows, he's nerdy and creepy, but very sort of lawyerly, polite, everyone is Mister and Missus. But, in private, I think he was very different. (jazzy music playing) Theodoracopulos: I first met Roy, as everybody did in those days, in El Morocco in '56. And he, of course, was famous by then. El Morocco was the chicest and most exclusive nightclub of the time. It was the kind of place where only very high society went, plus some loose characters who were welcome because it gave sort of some spice to the place. That's where Roy made all his contacts.

Romano: His currency was money, but he was a boy from Queens, and he was a sheltered boy from Queens. He didn't have any access to the big city. So, at first, Roy brought him into New York. Cohn: I met him at a supper club, which I rarely go to. I'm not too much of a night man because I have so much work to do during the day, and I guess the same can be said of Donald. He hates anything social, and he really doesn't like anything political very much either. One night, at Le Club, we were seated at tables next to each other.

And I just thought, on a principal ground, I should-- I should fight, and other landlords didn't. Manso: Trump was delighted by Roy's attorney's response to this suit against the two Trumps, and that was to counter-sue the US Justice Department. Roy called them Nazis! Roy called them the Ku Klux Klan! You know, but the whole point was to resist, to throw it back at them. Trump fell in love with that. Never admit that you're wrong. And the suit was settled. You serve a complaint, start an action, and then there's a settlement... Manso: Roy settled 65-75% of all his cases out of court. He used his influence with magazines, newspapers, and individual journalists to get people to settle lawsuits. The fear of publicity can be a very important factor in inducing a settlement, and we'd all be crazy if we didn't acknowledge that as a fact.

And to my right, attorney Roy Cohn. ♪ ♪ Michael Meeropol: When Robby and I got a lot of publicity, we discover that Roy Cohn has taken on the mantle of defending the government. Why was clemency not granted? What was standing in the way? Well, it is justified in the case of two people who stole secrets involving a bomb which could take thousands and thousands of human lives, and turning it over to an enemy, which has blacked out a good part of the world, and taken many human lives. What could be worse than -selling out your own country? -Host: Mr. Meeropol? Yes. The first thing that people have to realize is, of course, that the man who's saying all this was part of a prosecution team that engaged in subornation of perjury and a conspiracy to deprive civil rights by false prosecution. Now, he's not gonna stand on television in the United States and confess to doing that. He hasn't been in the habit of confessing crimes in his entire career, and I don't expect he's gonna start now. Fact remains that ever since 1953, we have uncovered perjuries on the part of prosecution witnesses. We have uncovered forgeries. We've uncovered factual material-- Now, you're accusing me of corruption-- -No, no, no, no... -That's a strong thing to say. Now, let me make a very interesting comment that your viewers may be interested in. We have a way of reopening the case right now. If I just told a lie about Mr. Cohn's criminal conduct, -I've committed libel. -Host: We don't-- -We've got a perfect chance to have a courtroom. -Host: Again-- Again, we don't want to get into this right here. Michael Meeropol: He knows what he did. He doesn't wanna do it. Host: I would like to hear more about the motivation... Michael Meeropol: Of course, he did know what he did. The point is he didn't care. If it wasn't for me, Joe, Ethel Rosenberg would be alive today. I would've fucking pulled the switch if they'd have let me. Why? Because I fucking hate traitors. Because I fucking hate Communists! Was it legal? Fuck legal. Am I a nice man? Fuck nice! They say terrible things about me in "The Nation." Fuck "The Nation"! You wanna be nice?!

I urge you to use the power of subpoena, get secret documents, talk to witnesses, put people like Mr. Cohn under oath, and keep at him about things that were developed, prosecution, changes, etc., etc. I feel the people who framed my parents trampled the American flag in the mud, and I think it's up to us to wash it.

Marcus: Roger Stone was a young campaign person who was working in New York, and he met Roy because Roy hosted him at parties, actually introduced him to Donald Trump. And Roger Stone got a lot of money, so that when Reagan was elected, Roger Stone and Ed Meese and people around him felt that they owed a lot to Roy for making connections and getting him money. Ronald Reagan also helped his fellow Republicans make a major change in the philosophy of Congress. It has become much more conservative in the Senate and in the House. John LeBoutillier: 1980, it was a big Republican year. And I got elected to Congress as the youngest member of Congress. I just turned 27 during the campaign, so I was... young. And within a week or two after I got elected, I get a phone call and a letter asking a favor from this law firm that was Tom Bolan and his law partner, Roy Cohn. They wanted their friends to get jobs from the Reagan White House. They asked me to support a candidate for a federal judgeship. And along the way, they asked me to write this letter, and they keep pushing it, which I ended up writing.

And he thought it was terrible that Jews were being associated with Communism.

Bob Simon: The star witness for the prosecution was David Greenglass. He now says this man made him do it. And did Cohn encourage you to testify that you... saw Ethel typing up the notes?

Michael Meeropol: In 1995, the CIA released the Venona transcription that attempted to prove that the government was right that Julius Rosenberg, my father, was a spy. Well, the media's reaction was, "The Rosenbergs are guilty." We were skeptical of it. But, of course, I had to contemplate what would it mean if it were true.

He was not the man who "gave" the atomic bomb to the Soviet Union. The other thing we would know for sure is that Ethel Rosenberg was not guilty of the crime for which she was charged. But there was a plot afoot. And the plot was, from the highest levels of government, to frame Ethel Rosenberg in order to get Julius to wanna save her life by ratting out the people who he was in contact with.

Romano: In the early '80s, I was living in Washington, and I had just joined "The Washington Post." After 30 years, the Republicans were hot again. And so, all of us, as young reporters, were pursuing all the new, young operatives. Among them was Roger Stone and Paul Manafort. And somewhere in there, Roger Stone, who I had cultivated as a source, said, "You need to meet my friend, Roy Cohn." Roy was very magnetic, and he knew how to cultivate the media. I mean, I used to see him at parties, and, you know, he'd be in town. He'd always stay at the Madison, which is across from "The Post." And he'd say, "I'm over here at the bar. Come on over and have a drink." And he would say, "I've got a good story for you," but it always served his purposes, too. Which is how I came to do a profile on Donald Trump. ♪ ♪ Throughout the whole two hours I'm with him, all Trump says is, "Either you got it or you don't," about everything.

He said, "I could know everything there is to know about missiles and nuclear arms in an hour and a half." And he said, "You know, Roy really wants me to do this. Roy thinks that I would be a really good nuclear arms negotiator." And during this period, he apparently sends word back to one of George Bush's operatives that he could be working in the administration. So, he was starting to feel pretty heady about himself and what he could be doing in government. Male Interviewer: Would you like to be in a position of negotiating disarmament? Is that really what's in your head? I don't know who's negotiating for us, who had in the past. I used to watch, under Jimmy Carter's regime, I used to watch people going over and looking at these Russians. And I could look at the Russians, and I could look at these people on our side, and I could say there's no chance. That's like the Pittsburgh Steelers playing my high school football team. Female Interviewer: Is it arrogant of Donald Trump to even think about negotiating a treaty with the Russians? It's not arrogance. It's the fact that he sees he has a talent in a certain area. Look, his next stop might very well be Moscow. (indistinct chatter) Romano: I think what Roy Cohn saw in Donald Trump was sort of an unpolished stone.

Geto: Roy Cohn was very involved with politics in New York City. He was a lobbyist and spokesperson for the Archdiocese of New York, which, in those years, was very, very powerful politically because the Cardinal of New York had enormous control and veto power over legislation in the City Council. Roy Cohn started making public comments. ...cannot be done, and the proof is not in what we say, but in the city... First of all, I don't like any of these rights bills. Women's rights bill, such as was defeated in New York, very properly. I don't like that. If the Gay Rights Bill goes to a referendum, I think the people will defeat that, too. I think there are features of that bill that constitutes a clear and present danger to the upbringing of children and to family life, and I don't think it's a cut-and-dried issue at all. ♪ ♪ Geto: Taking a very public, hostile stance to gay people made everybody who wasn't in the know feel, "Of course, there's a rumor that Roy Cohn is a homosexual, but that's ridiculous!" The other thing was the Catholic Church, and they had a similar problem. Cardinal Spellman was thought, by many people, to be gay. He was a very close social friend of Roy Cohn's, and he was very, very reactionary. That's the environment that Roy Cohn reinforced and pushed and supported in a way that oppressed millions of people. To know that this man was actively gay in his personal life and his social life and his sex life and so on. Again, I say the ninth circle of Hell is reserved for hypocrites. You feel pretty good. -I feel great. -Why? I mean, you were at death's door six months ago, three months ago. I was shaving one morning, and I had a... I felt a little bump. So I called the doctor, he said come in. And they did a biopsy, and they found I had liver cancer, uh, and they found that-- which spreads in... strange directions, and I was treated for three and a half weeks at the National Institute of Health. ♪ ♪ Marcus: He told me he was in an experimental program for liver cancer. I think they did not actually have an experimental program for liver cancer. It was trying AZT and other drugs for AIDS. Health officials will announce today whether an anti-AIDS drug is safe enough for widespread use against the disease. The drug AZT has been tested for more than a year on 140 AIDS patients around the country. While AZT does not cure the disease, it does reduce some of its symptoms. Did you get that radical treatment at NIH -that that Dr. Rosenberg, I believe, is now doing? -Cohn: No. -You did not undergo that? -No. I did not undergo that. -You scored! -Impressively. There may be 30 people in the whole country getting this drug? Now, there are 31. There are 100,000 people who need it. ♪ ♪ -(birds cawing) -(water lapping) Packard: He spent a lot of time here when he had AIDS. That's when I would see his poor, diminished body 'cause I lost a lot of friends, too. (inaudible) Waters: The town was so struck by AIDS. I mean, three-quarters of my friends died. He was one of-- the whole town was dying, basically. Packard: I wonder what Roy thought about the fact that he got AIDS. And those that escaped it, and those that didn't, but not Roy Cohn. He shouldn't have gotten AIDS. Right? I felt sorry for him. Doesn't mean I liked him or approved what he did, but I felt sorry for him as an individual. He didn't hide in that corner. It was right over there. But-- but he didn't want to be... out there, and-- and he wanted to show the poor kid he was with that he did have a life here. And he certainly couldn't take him dancing 'cause he was at the point where he couldn't walk, never mind dance. He was gay and he was sick. And he's got this child with him that he's infecting. You know, this really is sick. I was looking at a broken man, and he was everything he didn't wanna be. ♪ ♪ -Wallace: Do you have AIDS? -Oh, no. That's easy to answer. I'm goin', Ethel. Finally, finally done with this world at long, long last. The Almighty parts the sea of death, and lets his Roy boy cross over to Jordan! On dry land, and still a lawyer. Don't count your chickens, Roy. -It's over. -(gasps) -Over? -I wanted the news should come from me. The panel ruled against ya, Roy. No, no, they only started meeting two days ago... They recommended disbarment! Why do you think they're after you? There are disbarment proceedings. We're talking about two cases, in neither one of which anyone was injured even slightly, except me. Wallace: He borrowed $100,000 from a client, Iva Schlesinger, and then, despite his numerous written promises, he failed to repay her that $100,000. (Cohn speaking): -Romano: Mm-hmm. -(Cohn continues) -Cohn: Pardon me? -(Romano continues) Anyone who knows me knows I don't plead. And I'm not pleading in this case. Lane: He's fighting for his life, and, on some level, more importantly, his reputation. He probably cried more over the disbarment than the AIDS diagnosis. That's how important it was to him. In this last interview, I show up in Florida, and I was actually taken aback because I hadn't seen him in about a year, and he was extremely frail. He had lost a lot of weight, he had to be helped into a chair, his clothes were baggy, but he was game. He wanted to get stuff off of his chest, and we talked for an hour or so in this mansion that was-- I don't even remember whose it was, but it was this beautiful mansion on Worth Avenue. And then we went out to dinner. And, um, and I asked him, I said, "You know, what do you think about now? What do you dream about?" And he said, "You know, I dream about death, and I think about my funeral." (Romano speaking on tape): (Cohn speaking on tape): (applause) Crowd: ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ (singing continues, indistinct chatter) Woman: You have to make a very special wish. Ivy Meeropol: Did he feel that people were abandoning him? I'm not sure that he would ever show that side of him. But there are some of us who don't abandon friends, no matter what. Romano: Donald was plugged in. And I'm sure he had heard that Roy had AIDS. And when he's dying, Trump pulls away, and-- and it hurt Roy. He felt like he had done a lot to promote, to help bring Donald Trump along. Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in a salute to a winner, and a friend, Mr. Donald Trump. ♪ ♪ (applause) Trump: Thank you. I would like to just introduce quickly my family. My wife, Ivana, my father, Fred, my sister, the judge, thanks to the President. (laughter) LeBoutillier: It was a wrenching thing to watch. But a lot of Roy's so-called friends blew him off after he got sick. Brit Hume: Roy Cohn, the unorthodox and colorful lawyer who may have made more prominent enemies and more prominent friends than any American of his time, is dead. Cohn died early this morning of a heart attack. The virus HTLV-3, which is believed to cause AIDS, was listed as a secondary cause of death. (water flowing) Romano: How do you wanna be remembered? Cohn: I have no choice because I know I am gonna be Joe McCarthy's Chief Counsel for the rest of my life, no matter what else good or bad I should ever do. (somber music playing) Romano: If you could turn back the clock to 1953 or four, -would you do anything differently? -Cohn: Sure. Who, 25 or 30 years later, wouldn't do something different? Romano: What? Do you think you were too abrasive -as some people say? -Cohn: Sure. But, I'm not sure if I hadn't been too aggressive if I could've gotten any results. Romano: What do you say to people who say you ruined people's lives? Cohn: I say name one. Because I know what the truth is and they don't.
