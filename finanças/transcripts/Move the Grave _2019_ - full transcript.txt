Hey, is that your dad? Your dad is so ugly. He looks like a poophead. - What are you doing? - Hey! Dong-min, what are you doing? Dong-min! Stop it! Everyone! Don't say things like that to each other. Stop it... stop it! Seo Dong-min. Seo Dong-min! Be quiet, everyone! Seo Dong-min, go back to your seat right now. - Hey! - Dong-min! - Go back to your seat. - Dong-min. Stop bothering him and go back to your seat. I want to sit with my friend. - Seo Dong-min. - Go away. Go back to your seat. What do you think you're doing? Did you just stick out your tongue at me? You left me no choice. I'm going to send this photo to your mum. Fine, I'll go back to my seat. Don't send it to my mum. All right. Go back to your seat first. Delete it first. I'll delete it if you listen to me and sit down. Come on, delete it first. If you keep acting this way I'll send it to your mum. Delete it first. You could be lying for all I know. I don't lie. If you listen to me and go back to your seat I'll delete it. Go sit down. That's what you said the last time but you sent the photo anyway. You liar! I guess I'll have to send it to your mum. - Dong-min, stop. - You said you wouldn't! - This is my phone. - Bloody hell! Dong-min, what did you just say? Hye-yeong. As you may already know things aren't looking great for our company. - Right? - Yes. I've talked to our boss about this. If it were only a few months we could have the team cover your work... but a year would be pretty tough. You're right. Well... How about we say you'll resign after your leave of absence? I know... it's sad to have you gone after all these years. Raising a child alone is hard, isn't it? Especially when the child is difficult. Is it in the genes? Please get your work ready to hand over to the new hire. A week should be enough, right? Kindly relocate Baek Cheol-taek's grave by 30th October. Compensation for relocation will be forfeited after this date. Calling Seung-rak Move The Grave The number you've dialled is not available... Dong-min. Come here. I said, come here. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Either stay by my side or wait in the car. Hye-yeong! Over here! Dong-min. Sit in the back so your aunt can sit here. Why? Aunt Geum-ok is big. It will be pretty cramped back there if she sits with your other aunts. Dong-min, can you be considerate? How much will you pay me to do it? Not again. I told you not to do that. Can I ask Aunt Geum-ok to buy me a toy? Forget it. Just get out. - Hurry and get out. - Hell, no. I told you not to swear. - Hurry and get in the back. - Bloody hell. Dong-min! - Hey! - Why do you have so much luggage? We have to put it in the boot. Dong-min, open the door right now. How could you tease me like that? Dong-min, get it together! Stop it. Your mum's going to scold you. - Where's Hye-yeon? - No hitting. Where's Seung-rak? Hye-yeon said she'll come and Seung-rak isn't picking up. - Try calling him again. - Goodness. I'll call Hye-yeon. You call Seung-rak. No. I'll call Hye-yeon. You call Seung-rak. Too late. I'm calling already. The number you've dialled... She's not picking up. Neither is he. Let's just go. Rock. Rock... paper, scissors. Can we really go without Seung-rak? What else can we do? He's not picking up. We have no choice. Call Uncle and tell him we're on our way. Me? I don't have his number. I have it. Geum-hee, you call him. I said, call him. Rock. You do it. Hye-yeong asked you to. Listen to your older sister. I'm asking you to do it. I'm your older sister too. - Here's his number. - I don't want to... He scares me. Why are you scared of Uncle? I find you scarier. Hurry and do it. There! Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock. I won. - Why? Hello. H-Hello... hello? Pardon? Y-Yes. Oh, hello. Uncle, this is G-Geum-ok. Pardon? We're on our... We're on... We're on our way. All right. Why were you stuttering so much? Spluttering and stammering away. Shut up. I'm scared of Uncle. Are they on their way? Are they coming? My goodness. If someone's talking to you you should at least nod or look at the person. I can't tell if I'm living with a mute or a corpse. My goodness. He couldn't come to school for a while. He was taken to the hospital. The first... I mean the last I heard... Hye-yeong, does he ever wind down? Why does he have so much to say? He takes after his dad. What? What about Dad? It's nothing. What? I heard you talking about Dad. We were talking about how cool he is. - By the way, Aunt. - Yes? My dad went to the US to make money. When he comes back I'll buy you something delicious. OK, thanks. Are you going to buy me yummy food too? I like meat. I like beef. Sure. - Aunt Geum-hee. - Yes? Do you know what my dad looks like? I don't remember his face. Well, you can look at his picture. Do you want me to show you? No. She's finally calling back? Hello. Did you just wake up? We've already set off. What? You're the one who didn't pick up. What? She wants us to pick her up. Forget it. Tell her to go back to bed. You heard her, right? No, forget it. What? Hey. Hello... hello? Gosh, I hate her so much. We are building a support network for victims of sexual violence on campus. My goodness. I wish she'd just graduate already. She's still doing those things? Hey, put that cigarette out. Oh my. Hurry. We don't have time. What were you doing? Hey, Dong-min asked you a question. You don't need to know. - Dong-min, do you want a tangerine? - Yes. Here. Give one to Aunt Hye-yeon too. And share one with Aunt Geum-hee. She's sleeping. I'm not. Give me one too. Is there any coffee? There is. Hold on. God, that's good. That really hit the spot. Got any chocolate? I do. Hang on. Are you going on a picnic? Why did you bring so much food? Take this. I can't believe you. Why are you saving money when your husband makes so much? We can always buy food at a rest stop. No way. It's expensive. Besides, the food at those places is bad. It's the best part about a road trip. Is your little one with your in-laws? Well? Well, yeah... You had another fight? No. Why would we? It's been a little quiet these days. He hasn't caused any trouble? Your husband is a troublemaker. A troublemaker. By the way... Never mind. What is it? Never mind. I hate it when people do that. What is it? Tell me. Never mind. Seriously? What is it? They'll compensate us for relocating Dad's grave, right? I was wondering how much we would get. About $5,000. What? That's all? What are you going to do with that money? We'll split it. Why? It's not even that much. Shouldn't we give it to Geum-hee since she's getting married soon? Eat this. Don't eat it if you don't want to. I'll eat it instead. How stupid. What an idiot. Dong-min, is that how you talk to your aunt? Seo Dong-min! Hell. What? Oh my gosh. Stop it already. I'm not eating. Dong-min, where are you going? Come here. I need to pee. OK. Take your vitamin first. Come on. Is that a vitamin? Why is it so small? Hye-yeong, stay here. I'll go with him. Hye-yeong, it must be tough. Yeah? She has a high-paying job though. There's that at least. Yes. Yes, I just saw it. Yes, I'll send you the money right away. Yes. Wait. You'll send over the rest of the stuff too? All right. Here you go. Vanilla. Are you sure he's in the bathroom? I was here the whole time. I guess he ran away. You should've kept an eye on him. What were you doing? You were distracted, weren't you? Why would I be distracted? You stay here. Let's split up. He should be nearby. Wait right here. You should be careful. We finally get some peace and quiet now that Dong-min's asleep. Departing from Jangbong to Sammok 20:00 (Last boat) I guess they're here. - Oh my. You're here. - We're here, Aunt. Welcome. Where is Dong-min? - Hello. - Hi there. - Dong-min. - Wake up. - I guess we have to carry him. - Hello. Hi. It looks like Dong-min is still sleeping. Dong-min, it's me, Grandaunt. He's so heavy. When did he get so big? He's a big boy now. Let's hurry inside. Hello. Is that you, Seung-rak? Why are you so thin? Have you been skipping your meals? I'm Hye-yeon. - What? - I'm Hye-yeon. Gosh, you silly girl. What did you do to your hair? You look like a boy. Where is Seung-rak? I don't see Seung-rak. Well... Well, Seung-rak is busy at work today. He said he couldn't make time today. He couldn't come. - Is that so? - Yes. We can't relocate the grave without the man of the family! Bring him here right now! Your uncle is right. How could he not come? He should be here no matter how busy he is. Hurry and bring him here. Go on. - Hurry and bring him here. - But... Are we not Dad's kids? We're Dad's kids too. We're his kids too, Uncle. - OK? - Hye-yeon. I mean, we can do this too. Why do we need him? The eldest daughter is here. Hye-yeon. I don't get it. It makes no sense. What's wrong with you? Besides, he's our dad too. We can handle it ourselves. - What's the matter? - What's wrong with you? - What did I do? - Enough. Seung-rak's at work? What work? He's just a bum! - You've got to be kidding me. - Stop it. He's been ignoring all of our calls, OK? So much for the man of the family! - Let go of me! - Why are you so rude? - Let go! - Stop it! Oh my! What are you doing? Why did you have to break that jar? My goodness. - You act just like your brother! - Stop it. Does craziness run in the family? You're crazy! Please stop! Just go and bring Seung-rak. - Are you serious? - Bring Seung-rak. Let's go now! Just go. The man of the family should act like one! Go find Seung-rak. - Go on. - What is this? Enough! Be quiet. Doesn't this make you mad? Drop me off the moment we get to Seoul. I'm never coming back. Never again! You can deal with the relocation on your own! Be quiet, Hye-yeon! Pull over. Why? I need to smoke. Will Dong-min be OK? I'm sure he will be. You gave him his medicine. What do you mean? It's so obvious. That pill was no vitamin. What do we do now? Are we really bringing Seung-rak here? He's dead and still a nuisance. Can anyone get in touch with Seung-rak? He only texts when he needs money and he never answers my calls. Do you know where he lives? No. Do you? No. Why do we have to look after him? Are we his mum? At this rate we'll be changing his diapers when he's old and sick. Who are you calling? Seung-rak? Hey, Seung-rak. Why is it so hard to reach you? Where is he? Where are you right now? Where are you? Where is he? Just kidding. Are you crazy? Have you lost your mind? You really fell for it. So now what? Are we going to look for him? We have to. We'll go back and split up to find him. I'm not doing it, let me make that clear. Even so, you should be there when we move Dad's grave. Forget it. Handle it yourselves. After all, Dad liked you. Are you not his daughter? Fine, you won't get your share of the compensation then. What did you say? I can't believe you. Hey, you can have it all. Bloody hell. What? I said you can have it all. All right. Now get in. Let's go. Hey. Enough is enough. - Get in! - I'm sorry. - I'm... - Get lost. Hey, Hye-yeon! I can't believe you. Come here. Hey! Get in, Geum-hee. You too, Geum-ok. Mum? Is everything all right? No, it's a disaster. Why? - It's nothing. - So... I looked at the list of expenses you sent me. You did? Yes, but I think it's a bit too much for me. I've whittled it down as much as I could. I think we can cross off a few more items. For example, we don't really need to worry about our parents' birthdays. We don't need to give them gifts on holidays either. As for the daily necessities like toothpaste and toothbrushes I can just get them from Mum's place. First of all, I disagree with skipping out on your parents' birthdays and holidays. Your parents won't like it. - It will look bad on me. - I mean... And we can't go to your mum's place every time we run out of things. Where did you even get that idea from? Does that make sense to you? What's wrong with doing that? Why not? Why do you have to be so harsh with your... All right. I'll take out the daily necessities that are only for me. Like feminine products and cosmetics. - Happy now? - I mean... That's not what I... You don't need to do that... - Let's talk when I get back. - It's not... Bye. I don't get why I need to do this. Paste I'm looking for my brother, Seung-rak. Please reply if you know where he lives. Hey, even if you were angry you shouldn't have talked to Hye-yeon that way. Are you cash-strapped? Didn't you say his family is well-off? Aren't they buying you guys a house? Of course not. We need to get a loan. How much? How much money are they putting into it? Doesn't he have any savings? Who has savings these days? I guess you wouldn't understand. Everyone needs financial help. Geum-hee, you have to be careful with taking money from your in-laws. They might hold it against you later. That's not true. His family is not like that. They're not stubborn like our family. Forget it. Mind your own business. Hey, you never know. Are his parents from the West? All Korean in-laws are traditional even if they're from abroad. That's how they are. So how is it going with your house then? Are you looking for one? I guess you'll have to look for one outside of Seoul. Don't worry about it. Hey. You should never marry for love alone. Right? You can marry anyone. But once you're married, you're locked in. Love doesn't last. Marriage needs to be based on something that does. And what is that? Money. Hye-yeong. Are you that unwilling to give me money? Do you need that much money when it's just the two of you? You make a lot of money anyway. Why are you unwilling to let me have the compensation for my wedding? That's not it. Also, even if it's hard to raise a child alone how could you resort to medicating your son? Hey... Don't say things that you'll regret later. Have you raised a child before? It's so hard to do it when you're working. Also, Dong-min is a difficult child. Hey, have you worked a day in your life? You depend on your husband for money. Are you a leech? A leech? Are you crazy? Besides, why did you bring your luggage when we're here to relocate Dad's grave? You left home, didn't you? It's the only thing you can do after fighting with him, isn't it? What a leech. - Are you crazy? - What's wrong with you? - Hey, I'm driving. Stop it. - Are you nuts? How can you call your sister a leech? - Come here. - Hey! - Come here. - I said, stop! - Hey! - Hey! - A leech? - Stop it. - What's wrong with you? - I said, stop! - You're dead meat. - Stop! - Stop! - I said, stop it! Hey! Hell! Get out. Get out. I'm sorry, Hye-yeong. We'll stop. I said, get out! Hell. Hey, Baek Seung-rak. Where are you? I hate you so much. Your message has been recorded. My goodness. Dong-min, you're so well-behaved. What a good boy. Hey. When's your birthday again? Whose birthday? Yours. You little... 14th May. Wait a minute. What? Isn't that your husband? Where? Over there. I don't think that shop would have anything for you. I... I don't think it's him. What do you mean, it's not? It's him, all right. - It definitely is. - No, it's not. I can't believe it. We need to take a shot as evidence. Hye-yeong, get your phone. OK. I'm telling you it's not him. What do you mean, it's not? You too. Take a picture. Just take a video. You said it wasn't him. Hye-yeong, follow him. He sure came a long way for a haircut. What a schmuck. You knew? You knew about it and you're still with him? Are you stupid? I'm so angry. I ought to... No. You can't! Don't cause a scene. You'll mess it all up! What? You got this all by yourself? Of course not. I have someone following him. Wow. You keep a copy too just in case. OK. For backup. Send it to me too. OK. Should we send it to Hye-yeon too? Why not send it to Seung-rak while you're at it? Just tell the whole world. Hello, this is Seung-rak's ex-girlfriend. I know where Seung-rak is. - OK. - She gave her number. Let's go. What are you doing? What? Why? You want me to play with you? Yeah. Grandaunt. Did you know that my dad went to the US? He did? I didn't know. Mum said my dad would come back after 100 nights but he's still not back yet. Really? He will. Wait a little longer. He must be busy. He might never come back. That's not true. After 100 more nights your dad will return from the US. OK? This is boring! I want to go out and play. You can't. Your mum will be here soon. It's dangerous out there. Go play with Granduncle. I need to pee. Really? Then go inside. The bathroom is in there. Go. Ultimately, you're still a product of a Korean man. By the way... how did you two make time for today? You took the day off? - I took the day off. - You did? What about you? Maternity leave. You took maternity leave? Why? Your boss allowed you maternity leave? Wow. What a great company. Yeah. They allow you maternity leave but then you have to resign after that. What? What? How could they do that? They went easy on me. The other companies would have fired me on the spot for taking maternity leave. Don't you think so? I guess. Hey. Did you find him? No. Where are you? Where are you? Are you coming back? Where are you? - Well, we are... - Hey. - Hold on. - What? Is that her? Essay Competition Award I guess he's not home. He's in there. I just heard him typing on the keyboard. - Really? - Yes. I don't hear anything. He must know we're here. What the heck? What are you looking at? What? He's home, but he won't open the door. Seung-rak, open the door right now. You know what day it is? Why are you standing so far away? Are you going to keep acting this way? He won't open it if he knows she's here. Don't do this to me. Just open the door. So it was a bad break-up. Don't smoke so much. How many do you smoke a day? He's inside, but he won't open the door. He's such a pain. You're smoking again? Wow, you smoke a lot. You have no plans to quit smoking, do you? Seung-rak. It's me. Incoming call: Hye-yeong Seung-rak. Come out, please. Hell. Seung-rak, open the door. By the way I know this might be a bit insensitive of me but when did you break up with him? About three months ago. Three months? Thanks anyway. You're his family. How could you not know where he lives? Shall we break the window? My goodness, are you crazy? Seung-rak. She's pulling our leg again. Hey. Of course we're the only ones here. Why is it so hard to reach you? - He's inside? - We're the only ones here. He's inside, isn't he? Hey! How do we know? I can hear your voice. - I can hear it right now. - Hey. Hurry and come out. What? This kid really drives me up the wall. What? Why? He wants a picture of us in 10 seconds or he's not coming out. - Hey, Seung-rak... - He's so annoying. Text from Geum-hee What is wrong with this punk? What's wrong? There's someone with you. Do you think I'm stupid? Goodness. Excuse me. Are you really his ex-girlfriend? Why isn't he coming out then? Hello? Yes, Aunt. Yes, we found Seung-rak. W-What did you just say? My goodness. What's wrong? What happened? Did something happen to Dong-min? Hey, Baek Seung-rak. You won't open the door? You won't come out? - Hye-yeong. - Hye-yeong! - Hye-yeong! - Stop. - Hye-yeong. - Oh my. - Hye-yeong. - Hye-yeong, stop. - Oh my goodness. - Hey, Seung-rak! Hye-yeong, is your foot OK? - Are you... - Are you OK? Baek Seung-rak! I'm not saying you should take full responsibility. I'm partly to blame too. It's schmucks like you that give good guys a bad name. You know that? Why didn't you use a condom? What were you thinking? - Hey. - Tell me. That's sexual assault. - Do you know that? - Hey... Yun-hwa is talking here. Go on. Well, since you're mostly to blame for not being careful I want you to pay 70% of it. I'll pay the rest. Excuse me. - About the 70%... - Hey, Seung-rak. Look up. Look up and repeat after me. Let's use a condom. Hye-yeon. Repeat after me. Say it! Let's use a condom! Hey. I said, look up! - Hey. - What's wrong with you? I said, repeat after me! - Stop looking down! - Don't hit him. Are you glaring at me now? You lowlife rat! What's wrong with you? Stop it. I told you to stop! My goodness. What is wrong with you? Be quiet. Yun-hwa, continue. Anyway, if it goes over 12 weeks it might be impossible to get an abortion. Please hurry and take care of this. How much are we talking about here? 70% would work out to be about $5,000. $5,000? - Then... - You see... I did a rough estimation of the bill and the total cost here is only a little over $1,000. It doesn't include damages for emotional and physical distress. - I see. - That's... Right. $5,000 won't even begin to cover it. But still... isn't an abortion a little too hasty? - Why don't you think it over? - Yes. What's there to think over with this guy? There's still some time left. You see, Seung-rak isn't that irresponsible of a person. That's right. I know money is an issue... What if he ignores my calls again? What do I do if you guys ignore me? - We wouldn't. - No way. We wouldn't do that. You didn't even know where he lives. That's because... How could you be so clueless about him? You know what? I've been through so much because of him... Never mind. Yun-hwa, let's do this then. I'll wire the money to your account. Please check it when I do. Can I have your account number? You're not... using the compensation for this, are you? I can't believe you're asking that. The compensation? Hye-yeong, you shouldn't be like this. We're talking about killing a life here. No. It's not up to us to decide what to do. It's her decision to make. Why not? We're family. So what? You're here because you're family too. Hey! Why do we have to clean up your messes? Tell me. All right. That's enough. Yun-hwa. We can't deal with this right now. You have our numbers, so trust us. We'll discuss this tomorrow. I promise we'll be in contact. No. I can't trust anyone anymore. Please take care of it right now. Yun-hwa. If we don't leave now, the boat will... Anyway, we need to take him with us right now. You said you can't trust us. You can either take our word for it or come with us if you really can't trust us. It's up to you. All of you, get up. Why are you taking her? Just come out! Let's go. Gosh, Seung-rak... Hey, we've decided to cremate Dad. We fought with Uncle over this so don't mess it up. OK? Answer her. Will you answer her? Dong-min! Hey, you. What are you doing here? Come here right now, will you? It's OK. Come here. Hurry. That little brat... Will you go by yourself? Call Uncle. Hello, Aunt. You found him? They found him! They found Dong-min. We missed the last boat though. You'll send the boat back? OK. Mum! You've come a long way. I'm sorry, Hye-yeong. I'm really sorry. Seung-rak, you're here too. The man of the family has come a long way. Are you hungry? We can't do this without you around. Hurry inside. I've made a lot of good food so let's hurry inside. You must be hungry. Eat up. You won't find chicken like this anywhere in the city. Over there, they take a tiny chicken put it in a tiny bowl and sell it at an exorbitant price. This is different. This is Korean chicken. It might be a bit tough but it's chewy and delicious. It's better than some farm chicken that grew up on feed. Eat up, everyone, OK? What do you want? Eat this. Why do you give it to her and not me? You like her, don't you? Dong-min likes her. - I do not! - He likes her. Hey! - Stop it. - OK. Who is she? Well... she's my girlfriend. Is that so? You heard from your sisters, right? Hear what? About cremating your dad. Oh. Don't you think that's ridiculous? I know they're ignorant but you can't just burn your dad's remains. You're the man of the family. Convince your sisters to bury him instead. Got it? OK? OK. What did Uncle say? - Aunt. - Yes? Give us some too. OK. Why are the men drinking by themselves? I want some too. Thank goodness I got some from your jong-jo (great-aunt). You remember her, right? Yes, I remember jong-ju. No, not jong-ju. It's jong-jo. It's jong-jo? Not jong-ji? No, this is a jong-ji. Isn't it jong-ju? Isn't it jeung-jo? - Of course it's not. - It's jong-jo. Do you even know what jong-jo means? Our grandpa's younger brother's wife. That's right! You're so smart. You certainly are the man of the family. How many degrees of kinship is that? Four? That's right! Here. What should I do? You shouldn't. Please give me some. It's all right. When you had Si-eun, you drank a little... - Never mind. - What? It's nothing. Have some. What are you talking about? Aunt, here you go. Tell me. - Cheers! - Yes, cheers! This is good! Aunt, there's more, right? Yes, we have a lot. Pace yourself, OK? So Geum-hee, what were you talking about? It's nothing. Aunt is getting all curious. Don't tell me it's nothing. Is she... pregnant? So she is! Oh my. I'm so proud of you, Seung-rak. No wonder. I had a feeling. I had a dream last night. There was a huge snake coiled up in front of our house. It was a conception dream. A snake means it's a son. Your mum went through a lot to have a son. Both Hye-yeong and now your girlfriend. got sons on their first try. Your mum finally got her wish. Finally. Aunt, that wasn't Mum's wish. It was Grandpa's. Aunt, did you wish for a son? You didn't, did you? Look. What can be more important than having a son? What's the big deal about having a penis? Hey. What? Seung-rak had a great life growing up. He got everything of his own. He got his own room and his own clothes. Everything. When it came to food, Mum made the four of us share one portion while he got one portion to himself. Our clothes were all hand-me-downs. I put on weight so I could have my own clothes. - Really? - Yeah. You're a genius. I even wore clothes that he used to wear. Our dad worked so hard to save up for when his son gets married saying he'll need a house. But I didn't get a cent when I got married. We gave Dad our hard-earned money and he would give it all to Seung-rak. So, where are you from? Seoul. I see. How old are you? I'm 26 years old. Any siblings? I'm an only child. You are? Are your parents both alive? They've both passed away. And don't bother trying so hard. Why would I live with him? He makes no money and only cares about himself. Oh my. You are so honest and eloquent. Dong-min. Stop bothering her and play by yourself. It's fine. What's wrong with that? It's OK. What time do we leave tomorrow? What time do we leave, Uncle? Answer her. Don't you hear her? Are you deaf? He can be so frustrating. Why doesn't he ever reply? Was your dad like that too? He was. I liked it though. He pretty much left us alone. Mum had a hard time though. He was crazy. What's so funny? What's wrong with you? Why do you keep clearing your throat? Does your throat hurt? Is something stuck in your throat? By the way, do we have to cremate Dad? Hey. Are you drunk? I mean he wanted to be buried. It wouldn't be right for us to cremate him. He's right. I agree with Seung-rak. Hey, you talking about doing the right thing as his child is just ridiculous. Uncle, we've been through this. We've already arranged for him to be cremated. Dad wanted a burial. I mean, I just don't get why we need to cremate him. Hey, do you think we're doing this because we want to? They want us to move his grave. Otherwise, they'll do it themselves. We've already put him in the ground once. Geum-hee, is it that hard to move his grave? Is that what you're hearing? You've been missing in action this whole time. You don't get to tell us what to do now. What's important is that we remember him. Do we have to preserve his body? That's not it. A person is alive as long as he's buried. He only dies when he is reduced to ashes. Uncle, we'll be burying his cremains in the ground. OK? That's totally different. Frankly speaking, when Dad was alive he did say he wanted a burial. I'm starting to wonder why we need to cremate him. What's wrong with you? We've already discussed this, haven't we? Mum wanted us to cremate her, so we did. - Hey! - But Dad... Just keep quiet. Hey, that's because Mum wanted to make it easier for us. Does that mean you can just burn his body? If you want to be completely honest, Mum told us to never bury her with Dad. She had enough of all the patriarchy! Shut up! Women have no business yapping away! How hard is it to stay home and do the chores? Hey, it's too dark. Where are you going? Dong-min! Look at him. I can't believe it. He likes her so much. Dong-min, stop fooling around. Let him be. He's just a kid. Why are you up? Why are we all sitting here? What are you going to do? About what? It may be really hard for you... but she's having a harder time right now. Don't keep everything to yourself. You can share your worries with us. OK? OK. What about you? Me? What about me? When are you going to tell Dong-min? I have to eventually. That's partly why I brought him here. When Seung-rak was little he would follow us around everywhere. Wasn't he cute back then? But look at him now. - Hey, stop it. - "Hey, stop it." Just let them do what they want. It's their father after all. Goodness. Granduncle, how old is he? He's about my age. Oh, you're so old. Did you have a good night's sleep? Good boy. - Should I ride in the back? - Just get in. - Buy a new car. - Get in. What are you guys doing? Hurry up. You'll miss the boat. Do it like this? Is this OK? Compensation for Relocation of Graves Watch out for bees Hello. You're here. You're early. Please come with me. Excuse me! Please be quiet! Excuse me. Grave number 379! We're here to relocate the grave. - Number 379? - Yes. - All right, you're all set. - Thanks. Let's go. Please stop it! Be quiet! We're calling the police! What? Just go. I'll stay here with her. Just go. - Shall I stay behind too? - It's OK. Go ahead. Oh my. You've taken such good care of the grave. The children must really love their father. As I said before, it was hard for us to gather so we haven't been able to perform the ancestral rites. I understand. Take your time. Also, my brother is not number 379. He has a name, and it's Baek Cheol-taek. Well, I said that to make it easier for the employees. I apologise. What happened? Hey, Seung-rak! Is he all right? What's going on? Are you OK? Be careful... Excuse me, sir. We must begin the relocation soon. Excuse me, sir? Hye-yeong. You do it. Hurry. I'm sorry. About what I said yesterday... Please take care of it as soon as possible. Mum. Yes? I finally remember Dad's face. It's radish and cabbage kimchi. Share it among yourselves. You didn't have to, Aunt. You'll finish it in no time. You're so busy you're always eating out. Isn't that right? Those food aren't healthy. It's bad for you. Thank you for the food. Aunt. - Yes? - Here's a small token for you. - No way! I don't want it. - Aunt. - Just take it. - I didn't do it for this! - It's not much! - I don't need it. - Take it. - I said I don't need it! - I don't need it. - Come on. Take care, OK? Don't fight. You only have one another now. You only have one another. No matter how busy you are get together and eat on your parents' death anniversaries, OK? Take care of yourself too, miss. OK. Listen to your mum and be good, OK? OK. What a good boy. Hurry up. Let's go. Take care, everyone. Don't forget to call. - Come visit often. - OK. Unsent Message The flowers in our yard have bloomed.
