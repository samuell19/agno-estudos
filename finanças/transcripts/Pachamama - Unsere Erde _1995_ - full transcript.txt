Pachamama - Our Land Quito, capital of the Andean state of Ecuador. 2850 meters high. Until the Spanish conquest, it was the northern stronghold of the Inca kingdom of Tahuantinsuyu. The street leading to the old centre. It's Sunday. Rich people don't live here... they say the area is unsafe. The poor live in the neighbourhoods on the outskirts... Every week they head for the centre, to look for work for a few hours or days, to sell knick-knacks... to survive. The bell tower of the church of San Francisco. It is built over the ruins of a temple dedicated to the Sun. Here they hold Masses every Sunday, one after the other. The faithful come and go. The beggars and the sellers of newspapers and souvenirs stay. During construction work in the San Francisco square, they found remains of a culture much older than the Tahuantinsuyu. Next to the church is the Franciscan convent. The church and the convent were built in the 15th century, with the help of indigenous workers and craftsmen. In the cloister, the gravestones of the conquistadors. They brought death through sickness, forced labour, extermination. Here, in the convent courtyard there is a statue of Saint Catalina, shipped from Spain in 1640. When the indigenous craftsmen decorated the interior ceilings they also placed symbols of the own forbidden religion, images of the sun, the highest god of the ancient cultures. Also fruits from the country. Fruits also as decoration between the frescoes of the martyrs. "Mestizaje" is the name of the indigenous works that embellished the walls and ceilings of the Franciscans. The monks Christianized the indigenous people and opened schools whose students went on to become the chiefs of the communities. The Catholic church of Ecuador is divided. One side is mostly concerned with the poor peasants, with the unemployed in the deprived neighbourhoods, with the indigenous people. A representative of this Liberation theology was the bishop of Riobamba, Leonidas Proaño. Just before his death, the Bishop Proaño said: "I'm aware that the Church is the only entity responsible for the heavy burden that the natives had to carry for all these centuries. What suffering! What suffering!" On Simon Bolívar street in the old centre of Quito. It's a street with shops for ordinary people. Corn was cultivated in this area five to six thousand years ago, first along the coast and later in the mountains. In the northern marketplace of Quito fruit from the tropical regions is sold. Murals in the refectory of the Conceptas convent in Cuenca. "Mestizaje", from 1801. Indigenous music for the Fiesta de San Juan. "El sanjuanito". Arturo Aguirre - rondandor. Bolívar Rivera - guitar. Carlos Canto - requinto. The Amazonas Avenue the commercial street for those with power. Most of Quito's countless banks are here. North American capital is well represented and the national bank capital is in the hands of a few. In the 70's the banks multiplied like shantytowns when the oil export from the Amazon began at the cost of the forests and their indigenous inhabitants. Today, Ecuador's foreign debt is gigantic. The revenue from oil exports and from the licenses for its exploitation dissolve as debt interests are paid. Almost half of all revenue comes from oil export. Then come bananas, shrimps, coffee, metallurgical products, fishing, cocoa, textiles, wood and chemical products. Quito, the city and the mountains, painted by Oswaldo Guayasamín in 1942. "The Workers" "The Quarry" "Dead Children" Guayasamín has painted Quito again and again... The crater lake of the Cuicocha volcano, some 120 km north of the capital, now declared a national park. Here we can find plants almost extinct in other places. The "violeta del campo". The "romerillo" used for medical tea. Imbabura - sacred mountains and la fertile land. It is the territory of the Otavaleños. A soccer match between the communities living around the Cotacachi mountain. A First Holy Communion celebration. This ranch at the foot of the Cotacachi was expropriated and handed to the community of Tunibamba, in line with the land reform law which is rarely enforced. The peasants fought for years to achieve this expropriation. People died. Two civil servants from the peasant organization were killed. the culprits have never been punished. The owner didn't cultivate the lands. So he lost his right to the property. He could have sold it to the peasants, but he refused to do so... even though he owned three other ranches. Finally, a court decided to give this ranch to the indigenous community. The price was high and they will have to pay off the mortgage for many years. On the other hand, the banks won't grant credits for seeds. Still, the lands are being cultivated. Meanwhile, the owner died of old age. The peasants of Cotacachi meet in an assembly. All the communities have sent their representatives. They must debate the access to water and enlarging the irrigation channels. The head of the organisation, Pedro de la Cruz, speaks in Quechua, the old language of the Incas. A "minga", voluntary work carried out by the community. This time the idea is to make use of a stream flowing down from the mountain. They must filter the water and install a 13 km-long pipeline, in order to channel the water down into the valley where 10 communities live. They all participate in the works. This is the trench where the pipes will be placed. The work is done in turns: each community works a week per month. This leaves them only three weeks for farming tasks. The peasants leave their homes at five in the morning, arrive at nine, work all day and return home already deep into the night. The Swiss organisation that helps to develop the project has funded the materials, tools and their transportation. But the workers of the Minga cannot count on transportation. They are forced to walk. The peasant artist José Joaquín Guandinango plays traditional indigenous music. His son is keeping the rhythm. An anthropomorphous vase: Panzaleo culture, 300 years B.C. until 800 A.D. 'El Sapo', perhaps birth labour pains, Negativo culture from Carchi, year 800 to 1500. 'Assisting Birth', La Tolita culture, between 300 B.C. and 800 A.D. Birth "feet first", Jama Coaque culture, from 300 B.C. till 800 A.D. Wind instruments: Ocarina shaped like a woman, Jama Coaque culture. Chorrera culture, from 1200 to 300 B.C. Flagons shaped like fruits... and shaped like animals. Chorrera culture. The province of Mejía, South of Quito, the Corazón mountain. Harvesting potatoes at 3'300 meters high The owner has leased out his land... Its tenant prefers to hire women and young girls for the harvest. Watch out, the little donkey is coming! - How much do you get for your work? - They pay a thousand per quintal. - In what time? - Whatever I can make... At the moment I have seven bags, and with this one eight, I might go up to ten. 7'000 for one day. Do you get a part of the potatoes? I don't know, in the 2nd week, they said. We will see. It's my first day. In the lava of the Cotopaxi volcano the "Margarita de las alturas". The summit of the Cotopaxi - 5'897 m high. And 100 kilometres south, the Chimborazo. At 6'310 m, the highest peak on Ecuador. - What's your name? - María. Is it a boy? Or a girl? A boy. His name is Kléber Mauricio. - How old is he? One year old? - Yes. Here, in the high plateau of Cañar and Azuay, They emigrated to North America, or went to look for jobs on the coast. The women remained alone with their children and had to find ways to survive. María Tránsito Morocho is a ceramic artist in the community of Jatumpamba. Her daughter helps mixing the clay, the sand and the water. Add a bit more water. To shape the vase by beating, the 'golpeado' technique is used, a method already used by the Cañari culture, here in the south before the Incas. The vase has to be dried for some days, and then placed upside down. Is there enough wood for the burning? No, you have to get it from high up in the mountains. It is a lot of work to walk so far. The eroded lands of the high plateau. The eucalyptus, first planted here over a century ago, impoverishes the land. The poison of its leaves stops the growth of other plants, that could retain rainwater. In spring 1993 it rained torrents and the Tamuga mountain collapsed. With its woods devastated, hollowed out by rain, and destabilised by uncontrolled explosions in a quarry, the Tamuga gave way. Fifty thousand tons of rocks, stones, sand and clay crumbled and blocked the rivers Jadán, Paute and Cuenca. Some hundred people lost their lives. The water rose, submerging houses, factories, bridges and pathways. After a month, the giant dike collapsed. The mass of water, stones and mud rushed at a speed of around 9000 cubic meters per second down the Paute valley destroying everything in its path. "Listen, the Taita is coming" The Taita Carnival is coming to see you! You will stay at your neighbour's house and he will stay in yours!" "When the Carnival comes, I'll come along the Taita!" "Please help yourself, have some guinea pig and drink some chicha!" The group "Cañar Manta" keeps the Taita Carnival tradition alive. They are peasants living in the community of Quilloac. One of them is an expert in the Quechua language. The Taita Carnival is the big indigenous celebration: for a few days, all live happily together, and forget about life's brevity and the ordeals of daily existence. The myth says that the Taita comes from a faraway land, accompanied by the Yarcay. As they go along, the hills open up letting them into the subterranean cities where they keep the treasures of the ancestors. Sometimes the Taita takes some gold to offer it to a peasant. The gold can never be sold to a "mestizo". And the Taita must be given food and drink so that the summer crop is good. Whoever refuses will be a victim of Yarcay, who brings hunger and the evil eye. "I have it or I don't"... is the name of this joyous song that nevertheless speaks about the poverty they all know. Away from the asphalt roads and way further into the hills we find the remains of the Camino del Inca that linked Cuzco and Quito. The path runs at the height of the clouds, close to the ruins of an old Inca fortress. A piece of the "Paredones" fortress. Some have dug here looking for gold jewellery. The land of the Andes is carried by the rivers down to the sea. Banana plantations not far from the Pacific Ocean. On these shores they found remains of the Valdivia culture, six thousand years old. Before, they went out in boats to fish in the open sea. Today, they come and go between the waves and fish for shrimp larvae. Fishing companies buy the larvae at a low price and place them in nurseries in large tanks. The grown shrimps are exported to the United States for great profit. The high tide brings the larvae caught in the finely meshed fishing nets. But some days there are no larvae and the fishermen remain empty handed. For a day's work they make five, six... up to ten thousand sucres, a maximum of four dollars. This is a small figure we call the 'Venus de Valdivia'. It belongs to the first culture of Ecuador, the first organised sedentary people that made this female representation, probably part of a fertility cult. This is a girl not yet grown up. It's a girl without arms, but the most important feature is the hairstyle. Half of it is long, the other half cut short. This probably represents an adolescent girl. As we can see this is an adult Venus, we can tell by the shape, she has a kind of head-gear, her arms close to the body, and the features, especially of the face are made with incisions. The representation of fertility is easier to see in this Venus, this small figure, this woman with very long hair, is a grown up woman, but most of all we can see her pregnant belly. This is a type of Venus worn as a pendant by women to become more fertile. Here in the Agua Blanca community close to the coast remains of the Machalilla culture were found dating back to 3'500 years B.C. and from another later culture, the Manteño. Several weeks of torrential rain enlarged the channel in the ground uncovering a graveyard. In the graves they found squatting skeletons which the archaeologists took away to study. Only one urn was left untouched. This is a piece from the Chorrea culture, a people that used to live here on the coast, the hills in the East of Ecuador 1500 years B.C. It's a whistling bottle for carrying water and with the movement of the person carrying it, it sounds like the depicted animal. Inside the bottle we find two resonance spaces, that allow the air and the water to pass through, creating the sound. - And how does it sound? - It sounds something like this... This is a giant statue depicting a cat. It belongs to the La Tolita culture. This people and culture was deeply theocratic. The animals they depicted were very important, such as the cat, the snake, the jaguar, the alligator, the eagle... It's made of ceramics and by its colour can tell it is made locally. It was probably used in their temples. We can still find ceramic objects from that culture on the shores of Esmeraldas Province, mostly on La Tolita island. The Santigao river floods uncover the remains of vases and small figures. Antonio Alarcon, an islander, worked for some years for a team of archaeologists in a project funded by the Central Bank. Today there are no more funds for scientific research on this island, and Antonio has become guard hired by the community. Here is the difference. We are between the early, classical and early periods. What you see here is from 590 B.C. to 195 A.D., so between two and three thousand years ago. - The classical period? - Yes. - A lot of things? - Yes. - Who works here? - People in the community. - Can you show me other things? - Yes. These are two pregnant women, from the early and late periods, I believe. A man's arm, classical period and early period, a miniature. All these figures belong to the La Tolita culture. Luis Oquendo is restoring this head adornment as commissioned by the Central Bank. It's a thin sheet worthy of attention. Today it's difficult to achieve such thinness and you can see on both sides how perfect the work is, the excellent quantity and the quality of the gold. As the gold was the sweat of the sun, it was only used by the great monarchs, priests and the nobility in charge of the country. In the Chota valley, the Jesuits from the colony had African slaves cultivating sugar cane. The descendants of those slaves now live in San Miguel de Chalguayacu. They have their own music, a combination of African elements with influences from the indigenous and the European cultures. Some instruments are made of pumpkins others from simple orange tree leaves. The jungle in the East covers half of Ecuador and is part of the Amazon Basin. Here a quarter of all the plants and trees found on Earth grow, a third of all bird species live here. In the rivers we find as many species of fish... as in all the oceans put together. And we can also find oil... with thirty companies exploiting it. They cut the trees, build asphalt roads, poison the waters and threaten the basis of life of the indigenous people. Manioc is the essential food of the jungle. Plantain cooked until they get soft. A pre-Colombian urn from a "jungle princess". Way above the tree tops the Sangay volcano, always active. This melody is played when a child dies. In the house, from the moment his parents dress him up in his best clothes up until the moment they bury him. Written, Directed, Edited by Peter Nestler
