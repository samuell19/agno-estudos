(crickets chirping) (wind whooshing) (dramatic music) (fire crackling) (anvil clanging) (somber music) (water lapping) - [Andrew] Let me read you this from the "Dresdner Anzeiger" of February the 14th, 1883: A heavy and altogether unexpected bereavement has befallen musicians of every race, country and degree. We learn by telegraph from Venice that the greatest of contemporary composers, Richard Wagner, the second husband of Cosima Liszt, died there at four o'clock of yesterday afternoon. He occupied a loftier station than king or kaiser, pope or president. No monarch was ever more enthusiastically served than has been Richard Wagner. Infallibility, embodied in a Roman pontiff, has never been more implicitly believed in by the most orthodox Catholic than it has been in the person of the Bayreuth Prophet! Put well, do you not think? Put well. (dramatic music) (chains clanking) (fire whooshing) (wind howling) (gentle music) It goes on, it goes on: Time and space fail us even to make passing reference to the literary labors with which his busiest years were in great part occupied. A free thinker in matters religious, a democrat in matters political, of a surpassingly combative temperament, Wagner could scarcely fail to involve himself in the revolutionary agitations of 1848, in Dresden, where he held some minor musical appointment. Minor! In the light of Wagner's future, perhaps, but Kapellmeister to King Friedrich August II of Saxony was a post! To those of us here in Dresden, a respected post. Irksome to have to visit the king in his castle at Pillnitz, a song in one's pocket, to have to make music in praise of one of those very princelings one's political soul cried out against. But that was the condition of Germany in the 19th century. Insignificant city states. And it was a post! (singing in foreign language) (king moaning) (singing in foreign language) (cymbals crashing) (man snoring) - (speaking in foreign language) Majesty? - Who's responsible for this noise? - Reissiger conducted the piece, and it was got together by Herr Wagner, Your Majesty. - Wagner? - Wagner. - Very well conducted, the piece. Herr who? Herr who? - Reissiger. - Oh, oh. - I lay myself at your feet, Majesty. This piece does have within it some not inconsiderable (laughs). - Very well composed, Herr Wagner. Very well arse-licked, Herr Reissiger. Oh, do you think so, Majesty, do you think so? I did do my best. Then I do dash myself under your feet, dash myself twice. - It's different every time he relates it. We were not late. As if I'd allow him to be! Hm, hm? - There sat I, paws up, tail wagging, waiting for a pat on the head from von Luttichau, begging to have gold put into my mouth rather than into the mouth and tooth of His Majesty. But what does it matter? It is the path of the liveried servant here in Saxony. In the event I said thank you and gave my royal master the lot again. But so moved my army in its retreat, my Grande Armee of ill-disciplined musical invalids and veterans, so moved them, cajoled, nudged, shoved, willed them, the whole maneuver so steadily executed, thanks to my unexampled activity, that Reissiger never even knew we had left until von Luttichau told him so. The last notes falling on an echoing dream on the royal ulcerated tooth and ear, mm? Wasn't wasted though. Later used it all in "Tannhauser," mm? (gentle music) (crowd chattering) (somber music) - [Crowd] Wagner, Wagner! Wagner, Wagner, Wagner, Wagner! Wagner, Wagner, Wagner, Wagner! Wagner, Wagner, Wagner, Wagner, Wagner! - There is something to being German altogether curious, you know. We can take a song like "Among The Meadows And Woods," and set it to music in such a manner that we all dissolve in tears. And yet when we look about us and see, instead of a united fatherland, a hotchpotch of 34 kingdoms and principalities, we are unmoved. Our eyes remain dry, our hearts do not beat faster by one note. Why, why? Are we little people with minuscule minds, mere servants, ruled by and subservient to our betters? (crowd cheering) I say to them, our rulers, I say, cast your titles and distinctions from you! (crowd cheering) We too, the common people, have ancestors. And though they had no titles, were not ushers of the shithouse. (people laughing) (crowd groaning) Their deeds of daring, their vassalage, their sufferings, are writ reeking in letters of blood! (crowd cheering) Their blood, our blood banner! (crowd cheering) Two camps have arisen in Europe. The cry from one is Republic, the cry from the tents of the other is Monarchy. Monarchy? What do you see? You see a blinded and corrupt tribe, the rulers of Hessen, Bavaria, Prussia! (crowd cheering) - I agree! - What then of our own king? I, his Kappellmeister, dare say this to him, become a prince who heeds our advice. - [Crowd] Here! - Banish the sniveling Junkers and their swooning dames. - [Crowd] Here! - Consult instead the free folk, the German folk, - [Crowd] Here! - Those noblest of children like unto gods. Not servants in livery or slaves of whim, but elected and free. Every man with a vote. Our minds strengthened by understanding of our past, the myths and legends and religion of Germany. Let him, our king, let him say, I declare Saxony a free state. (crowd cheering) Let him rid himself of his sycophants, and if he will not, a word of warning, as Christ says, "If thy right hand offend thee, cut it off!" - [Crowd] Here! - Cut it off! - [Crowd] Here! - Cut it off! - [Crowd] Here! - Your fatherland is called Germany. Love it above all, and more through action than through words. (crowd cheering) Germany must have its place in the sun! (crowd shouting in foreign language) (bright music) - [Pfeuffer] I've read your husband's latest scheme for an opera, Frau Wagner, "Lohengrin." - Yes, the "Poem of the Swan Knight." - Oh, how wonderful! A swan knight. I can see all the little elves and fairies dancing before my eyes. - Unfortunately we can't give it. These unsettled times, your husband writes to the newspapers, Frau Wagner, makes speeches he ought not to make. The King himself has had to prevent one of his officers from challenging your husband to a duel. "Lohengrin," it is stirring and German and wonderful. If only Herr Wagner were not determined on setting it to music himself. (dramatic music) (audience applauding) - Meser, why do you remove my Tannhauser from your window, all the copies? Is my work not fit for your shop? What do you replace them with? What's this? Meyerbeer, dear God, Rockel, we used to admire this man. - And so you should. Meyerbeer's a master, he sells copy on copy. - That's because you are not his publisher. You're an incompetent idiot. - Ah, am I though? Am I? What are you, then? This, returned from the Munich court theater. - This is monstrous! They have not even broken the seal to read it. - Exactly. You ain't being given, Herr Wagner, that you ain't. But Meyerbeer is, which is a fact, hence he can go out where he might be bought, "Rienzi"? Outside Dresden, where? Performed once only in Berlin. - Yes, and? - And? - [Robert] Konigsberg! - Where? - It is successful every time it is given here in Dresden, so is "Tannhauser", so too will be "Lohengrin." Damn you, Meser, I'm of a mind to withdraw "Lohengrin" from you. - Then I would remind you that you are not entirely drawing the town. I will not go forward with "Lohengrin" until you give me some money. - Then you will lose a revolutionary work, sir! And are we not all revolutionaries in these times? - No, we ain't, Herr Rockel. We are not. We ain't. You sport with known revolutionaries, you have ideas above your station as to unions for musicians and a total turn out of the Dresden Opera on its head, which you put forward in writing above the noble head of your director, direct to the King! Direct in writing! Which king you would have murdered in his bed. This time we live in is no time for grand opera, no time at all. And a word to the wise, hear me. Herr Director Luttichau has intimated to me as he ain't gonna do "Lohengrin", for your arrogance and your scorn of the established genius such as Meyerbeer's genius, all of which gives me no faith in you, young man. Get rid of this anarchy and all, then perhaps there'll be time for an opera, or better still an operetta. - There are going to be new theaters, new music. All who come between German folk and their art will be swept away in the revolution coming. - Will they, though? - Barbarossa, I am considering Barbarossa as a fit subject. Germany looks for another Barbarossa. - Barbarossa like Lohengrin is not a fit subject for an opera, not at all. It ain't light enough, no laughs in it. (coughs) And what is more, no person will wish to hear it, in that it involves that which people do not wish to hear. (door thuds) (clock ticking) - [Minna] Shall you not do duty with the Communal Guard? - I shall not, I have resigned. - [Minna] Why? - I suffer from a double hernia. - Should you not go to Doctor Pusinelli? - It was Anton Pusinelli who recommended that I had a double hernia. - [Minna] Why? - So that I need not do duty with the Communal Guard. - [Minna] Why? - Who can tell which side they're going to fight on? For the revolution or against it. - [Minna] I don't understand. Forgive me, Richard. - In Paris it's about the starving rising up. In Hungary it's about the oppressed shrugging off Austrian domination, but who in turn will be dominated by the Russian tsar. In Saxony, here in Dresden, it is about being given a sop in the form of an assembly in Frankfurt, which purports to be an assembly of all Germany, but isn't. Which should have power but hasn't any. We are still half in Austria and half under Prussia. And it's about the Parliament which our king now threatens to dissolve. There isn't a Germany yet. And until there is a Germany or a German consciousness, I'm not going to have an audience. Damn it, people like me, people like Semper, Rockel, Pusinelli, people with minds, free minds, doctors, lawyers, musicians, are always going to be subservient to the likes of Luttichau, to the court, to a court theater run by someone who was Keeper of Forests and Trees to the King. - He and Frau Luttichau have always been very kind to us. - Kindness, I don't want kindness. I want money and I want a theater. I have plays, ideas for plays, they're good, well thought-out ideas. What happens to them? My report on the state of the royal orchestra, what about that? Three months to prepare! Three months, not even read by the king. My ideas for a national theater of Germany, what about that? Not taken seriously. - Well, if there isn't a Germany. - [Richard] Hmm? - Liszt is going to give "Tannhauser" in Weimar. - Yes, Liszt. - Your devoted friend. - He also knows how to-- - How to what? Tug his very beautiful forelock to his royal masters? - Whenever you tug any part of him, he responds. - [Richard] I know, the only one. - Oh, please, Richard! - Don't plead with me, Minna. This isn't a time for pleading, hm. How can one talk to these sabbath Christians? I'm a better Christian than them because I understand what it is to be a pagan. Luttichau, so pure he extricts, extracts himself from stinking when he farts. Talk to him about an art that embraces everything, music, poetry, drama. I know what it is I'm brooding on. You know, I have told you, a grand, heroic, yes, for lack of a better word, opera. Yes. Siegfried's Death, hmm? Fire, water, hmm? Destruction, and out of the cleansing, a hero, a German hero. (dramatic music) (fire crackling) Christ, Barbarossa, Siegfried, the same person. - [Minna] You know that nobody will be able to stage it. - Do I? You mock me for my seriousness, but if one's not serious about work, what then? There is a stage, it is out there, it is going to happen. You would have me a journeyman, on call as with the king and Luttichau, paid to toss off a pretty little tune, an accompanying tremolo to whatever hack drama they see fit to put on. A pluck of strings, rumble of drum to signify that depth of feeling which the words have been too shallow to express, that is my job as Kappellmeister! - That is not true! (dramatic music) (fire crackling) - [Robert] You're afraid. - Yes, I am. - I was a journeyman once, did everything, when I first knew you. Magdeburg, the scenery, everything. - You emptied the hall of everyone but your most ardent creditors with your "Battle of Vittoria." - A triumph of noise. Scored for bugle drum and firecracker. Such a battle has seldom been more cruelly fought in any concert hall. And you, you, Minna, you didn't even stay. (clock ticking) - I hate noise, bangs. (cannon booming distantly) (people shouting) Oh, God. It has begun. - Come on, up here, more. Up here, yes, as much as you can. Come on! Yes, very good, come on. we haven't got much time, come on! More, more, yes, that's the way. Yes, very good. (somber music) Yes, come on, plenty over here! Come on, as high as you can! Come on. Yes, very good! Yes, that's good! Come on, up here on the top! - [Ottilie] Uncle, uncle, what is it? - [Clara] Uncle, is it fighting? - Yes, it is, Ottilie, Clara, you are present at the beginning, a revolution led by artists and men of means against privilege, intellect against indulgence. Get me some food together, Minna. I'll be gone for some time, until it's all over. The revolution, the revolution at last! (dramatic music) (door rattling) - (gasping) After all these years, after years of struggle, at last, Kapellmeister to the King of Saxony, respected and secure in the post. - Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! - No, no, I shall not! I shall not, not at all, not at all! No, no, Richard. - [Richard] Open this door. Do you hear me? (fists thudding) - Oh, Richard, they've come for you. They've come for him. - Richard, Richard, where is Richard? We've started it. The king dared to dissolve the Parliament. Minna, where's Richard? When Richard comes, he's to go to the foundry. - (sighs) Dresden is one of the foremost theaters in Germany. (sighs) We are so lucky. - [Richard] Open this door, do you hear me? - We have starved. When we first came to Dresden, we knocked walnuts from the trees to eat. (crowd shouting faintly) I was so ashamed. - [Richard] Open the door! - You have borrowed money from everyone, even from the members of your own orchestra who have little enough themselves. You rant about their conditions, their poverty, their ill health and then you borrow from them. - Open the door! (crowd shouting faintly) - The only friends you have left have nothing themselves. Anybody will do. Anybody. Richard? (door rattling) (dramatic music) - Bakunin, see here, come, look. - [Bakunin] I see. You are facing your king's soldiers drawn up in ranks. Your own soldiers against you! - Semper, see that it holds. Bakunin, these, calling on the soldiers not to fight us. - Ludicrous, amateurs! - Soldiers of Saxony, lay down your arms! Come with me, Semper, Bakunin, we shall inform them of their real duty. - Simpletons! - Lay down your arms, fellow Saxons, fellow Germans. Join us, the people of Dresden, bearing arms to defend our liberties and yours, our liberties and yours. We are all in the same boat. We have to defend ourselves against oppression. Whatever happens in this world, let us all be true Germans. - If you ask me, whole thing is doomed to failure. (dramatic music) (fire crackling) (men shouting) (horses whinnying) (artillery booming) (men shouting) - The working man must lead in the social struggle to come. (men shouting) Free men, artists, all of us. Our struggle today must express the will of free people everywhere, regardless of national boundaries. (crowd cheering) Our nationalism, our nationalist socialism, must be only an ornament, not a limitation. Our work will either be to free the human spirit or else condemn it forever to chains of economic bondage. (crowd cheering) - [Crowd] Wagner, Wagner, Wagner. Wagner, Wagner, Wagner. Wagner, Wagner, Wagner. - Wagner, Wagner, someone must show us, show us what to do, direct them. - [Richard] Me, not me. Ask Bakunin, he's the professional revolutionary. I'm just a musician. You, Semper, you build excellent barricades. What do you suggest? You? - No, no, no. Bakunin may well decide to throw in his lot with this amateur revolution, but I'm sure he'd say that it was doomed to failure. The wrong people are inspiring it. I mean, people like you and me. I think he's just using us to fan up the flames. Why don't we climb somewhere where we can see what's happening? - Ah, the Church of the Cross. - Good, good, you go. I am an architect who has no head for heights. - Up there, like Christ on a temple! - Oh, yes, yes. When you write your Jesus Christ opera, the tenor must sing nothing but * Off with his head! And the soprano - * Hang him And the basso continuo, that's Bakunin, * Fire, fire, it's the only way * * The only way is to destroy everything * * Rubbish - Yeah, yeah, yes, yes, perhaps you're right. * Off with his head * Hang him * Fire, fire * Off with his head * Hang him * Fire, fire * Off with his head * Hang him * Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire * Fire, fire, fire (dramatic music) (fire crackling) * Destruction * Destroy and start again - You set fire to your opera house! - No, of course I didn't, but I should have done years ago. Such places should be burned down, set light to it. One can't do anything with such places, Semper. The places are built for Italians and the court, tiny houses for tiny music, little mice squeaking in tune. This, this is theater. This, flames, we need theaters that are this. Amphitheaters of fire, buildings that might encompass this, contain this. This is theater! (men laughing) (fire crackling) (horse whinnying) (men laughing) (men laughing) I scribble notes, what I see for days, in the hope it may be useful, may help them aim their shots. (artillery booming) (bird chirping) (bullet pinging) The lark, up there, soars to a dizzy height. Larks and heroes. Oh, how long will this all go on? Weeks now. The bullet that can lay me out has not been cast. - Left, right, left, right, left, right! (dramatic music) (footsteps thudding) (bullet pinging) - Do you see them? - What? - The bloody Prussians, thousands of them, pouring in. (men shouting) (guns firing) (dramatic music) (men shouting) - Halt, halt single file. Halt! (guns firing) Company, halt! (man shouting) Halt, company, halt! (man shouting) (horse whinnying) - Herr Wagner, we have met. - Go back to your Prussian master, sir. - Take note I come at the request of your king to restore peace and order. Ridden post to get here. You may go back to your rum-tiddy-dumming, bandmaster. - Damn me, had I a musket, I'd drum you, sir. Go back to your royal Prussian master. See if he wants his boots given a polish! - You thought highly enough of my king when you were touting your songs in Berlin. Tell me if I disremember, but didn't you offer to write him a march? - I accept royal patronage no more. True patronage will come from the people of a united Germany. - Under Prussia, sir. - Under no man, sir, unless we elect him. (sword clattering) - Because of my high regard for you as the composer of "Rienzi," I shall not cut you down where you stand. I don't fight musicians. - [Man] Right wing, fire! - Prepare yourselves. (horse hooves clopping) (men shouting) - [Man] Fire! Fire! - What did the Prussian say? - He'd seen "Rienzi," must have liked it. (Bakunin scoffs) (suspenseful music) (man shouting drowned out by music) (artillery booming) (guns firing) - [Man] Fire, now! (artillery booming) (guns firing) (men shouting) (singing in foreign language) - [Crowd] Wagner, Wagner, Wagner! (artillery booming) Wagner, Wagner, Wagner! (artillery booming) (singing in foreign language) (men screaming) (artillery booming) - [Bakunin] I don't doubt you'll get more out of it than I did. (metal clanging) (people screaming) - [Andrew] It was as well that Wagner left Dresden when he did. Another day or so and he would have been clapped in prison. Rockel was confined for over 13 years. As it was, a warrant was quickly taken up for Wagner's arrest and return to the scene of his activities on the barricades, there to be brought to trial, to face the music as it were, to face the music no longer as Royal Kapellmeister with an orchestra at his bidding, but as a proscribed criminal, a fugitive from justice. (gentle music) For two months, he stayed out of the clutches of the authorities until he was at last forced to flee Germany entirely. Entirely. He crossed into Switzerland from Bavaria, at Lindau on the Bodensee, in disguise. False papers. Alone. But as he wrote to a friend, "From these ruins I shall find most whom I need, "then I shall erect a theater on the banks of the Rhine "and scatter invitations throughout Europe "to a great dramatic festival." He did say that. Then, as a man on the run, as it were-- - Which one is yours? Are you Professor Widman or Herr Itzenpliz? - Widman. (boat whistling) (gentle music) - [Andrew] He was not to return to Germany, any part of it, not Saxony, not Dresden, not Bavaria. No state would have him home for over a decade. He was not to build his theater and scatter invitations for 27 years. (flag rustling) (birds chirping) (bright upbeat music) (door creaking) - We've lunched. And now they are removing my doors. (laughs) For some reason best known to themselves. Herr Muller, why is it necessary for Herr Wagner to remove my doors? - Mr. Wagner must have a stage. - Hm? - From which to read us his poem. - Ah, hm. So, I see, so Herr Muller, I have provided a stage, a stage, for Richard Wagner. - Sit down everybody, please. Make yourselves comfortable. Before, before reading my poem "Siegfried" to you, before doing this, I would like you to try and understand my position. - On a door, you are positioned on a door. Isn't he, Baumgartner, on one of Jacob Sulzer's doors? - Please, please, please! - My position as an artist, my reasons for being a year in exile without writing one note of music, my purpose, my quest, my search for and study of those myths and legends of our German past. The German artist of the future will emerge from his mythic past as I am emerging. I am shedding those distractions which wasted me, those boltholes into oblivion. Security, success, fear of failure, change. I seek to change entirely that which has led to me being here, searched for as a posted criminal in my own country, where we failed to change anything, hm. Out of the realm of the womb of night and death, there came into being a race dwelling in Nibelheim, that is in gloomy subterranean clefts and caverns. They are known as the Nibelungs. Feverishly they burrow through the bowels of the earth like worms in a dead body. They anneal and smelt and smith hard metals. (gentle music) - [Andrew] Wagner began the years of his exile in Zurich, a town devoid of art in the public sense. But it did have a thriving music society. And good, simple-hearted cultured persons, determined to be friendly, put him in the way of a few coins to pay the rent. Minna had resisted joining him for some time. She had been happy in Dresden. It had been all she wanted until the barricades went up, and she was fearful that as soon as she left Dresden she would be shut out, borders closed against her as they were against her husband. She could not face the thought of a life of exile outside Germany. But she allowed herself to be assured by those of us who knew such things that there would be no question of her being forbidden Dresden. She had no charge against her of any action treasonable. She could therefore come and go as she pleased. So, blameless, she went to be at her husband's side in his exile in a foreign land, his pleadings answered. Very well, she thought. If she was sure she could always come back to her beloved Germany, she would go, make a home for her beloved Richel with Natalie, her daughter by a previous never-mentioned liaison, their dog Peps, her parrot Papo, and sundry items of furniture and comfort. - [Richard] Siegfried's Death. First Norn. - First what? - [Man] Norn, you fool! - Norn. - First Norn: In the East I wove! Second Norn: In the West I wound! Third Norn: To the North I cast! What wound'st thou in the West? Second Norn: What wov'st thou in the East? First Norn: Alberich robbed the Rheingold, bent there from a ring, bound there by his brethren. Second Norn: Thralls the Nibelungen, thrall to Alberich since his ring was stolen. Third Norn: Free the elves of darkness. Free too Alberich. Rheingold, rest in the waters. First Norn: In the East I wove! Second Norn: In the West I wound! Third Norn: To the North I cast! What would'st thou in the West? Second Norn: What wov'st thou in the East? First Norn: The giants built the Godsberg. With threats they asked "The Ring" in pay. The Gods bereft it from the Nibelung. (men snoring) (gentle music) - [Andrew] When she got there, in September 1849, she rolled up her sleeves and set to, set to. - That on night hide once I'd fought when the fearsome worm I slew. Hagen: Brunnhilde, woman bold, knowst thou a right "The Ring". Wast it to Gunther thou gav'st? Then is it his? And Siegfried hath won it by trick, which the treacherous years shall atone. Brunnhilde: Betrayed, betrayed most shamefully betrayed. Treason, treason as never yet was venged. Gudrun, the Clansmen and Women: Treason, vengeance! (men snoring) On whom? (gentle music) (bird cooing) - Ah, Liszt. Let's see. "The Fairies." 37 years of age. (laughs) The Royal Kapellmeister Richard Wagner is wanted for examination on account of his active participation in the recent uprising. Medium height, brown hair, wears spectacles. That could be anyone. Thank God. - Wotan, Wotan, ruler of Gods! Wotan, bless thou the flames. Burn hero and bride, burn eke the true horse. In joy may greet Valhall, made one for a bliss without end. My venger, Hagen, my son. Rescue, rescue "The Ring". The end. (men clapping) - Herr Wagner, let me fill your glass. You have of course read Wolfram von Eschenbach, the Northern Sagas? - [Richard] Yes, yes. - [Man] Opera bores me, bores me, it's got nothing to say. - [Richard] I don't write operas. I write music drama. - Ah! - Shall I go. - That's it, that's the thing. That doesn't bore me at all. Are any of your musicals being given anywhere? - Ah, yes, musicals. - Liszt is giving Tannhauser in Weimar. - I can't go there! - Neither can I any more. - Switzerland is full of people trying to flee from somewhere, Paris, Vienna. - Dresden. - Ah, yes, Dresden. He'll be arrested should he show his face anywhere in Germany. - Paris. Take this Siegfried fellow to Paris. But you'll have to put songs in it for Paris. - Ah, yes, songs. (dramatic music) (audience applauding) - To meet you at last, Frau Wagner. Tell me, was the concert not? - No, it was not. - I know that most of the orchestra are amateur musicians, but does the music not? - It does not. - Oh! Dresden has one of the finest orchestras in Germany. - This is a band. - Oh! - A small-town band. A Swiss cheese and mountain call band. - Oh! (crowd applauding) - You were all quite dreadful! - I think that Richard's greatness lies in the way that he faces adversity. - Do you? - Oh! - My dear Sulzer, come in, come in. - I hear that your friend Meyerbeer has had another big success in Paris. - My dear Sulzer, you would not have me pander to a swindler such as he? Meyerbeer. Last time I encountered Meyerbeer was in Paris in the music shop of Schlesinger. Was, at one time, Schlesinger's, now owned by a much more pronounced type of Hebrew, one Brandus. Now while I made conversation with dear old Monsieur Henri, the only person left at all friendly and welcoming, do you know, Meyerbeer hid from me? But I winkled him out, brought him to face me there. Meyerbeer, master of melodious moonshine, forced to come out of his lair, stuttering and stammering, professing false goodwill, and here it came, here it came. His assumption that I was in Paris to seek, as it were, my fortune! - Meyerbeer was always willing to help and did so often, but like everyone else who helps Richard, they are eventually repaid with scorn and derision. - Oh! - Meyerbeer gave out a belch of manuscript dust, his assumption dispelled by assuring him that the thought of having anything done, or underdone, or overdone in Paris was odious to me. But, whines Meyerbeer, Liszt has published a brilliant article about you. We all read it. Ah, replied I, it had not really occurred to me that the enthusiastic devotion of a friend should be regarded as speculation. But, quoth he, and here the man lies bare, the 30 pieces of silver chink, but the article created a sensation in Paris, you must surely seek to make profit out of it by following it up with something. Profit? I told him that there were greater occupations for my mind when the whole world seemed to be in turmoil and reaction. But, a great but-erer is Meyerbeer, but what do you expect to get out of it? Are you set to write scores for the barricades? Whereupon I told him it was not in my mind to write any scores at all, which took the ground straight from under him and laid him on it. Meyerbeer, The Meyerbeer clique! Twittering Nibelungs, maggots deep in the flesh, feeding on the sweet, pretty, fleshy confection that is Paris, a blood cake iced and spattered with silver and gold. Pretty tunes, music for brothels. Deep inside the cake, they twitter and wriggle and copulate and kiss and suck, growing bellies that are fat, shoulders broad enough to carry the ponderous crucifixion of fame. Victors of the fame game. I, Meyerbeer, salute you with five acts and a ballet decollete called an opera! Bravo, an opera by Meyerbeer! The world hangs hushed on every nauseous note, stands transfixed in awe at titles promising seriousness. Hollow titles, rattling with arias and melodramatic arpeggios. Empty rodomontade titles like "The Prophet," a prophet who tells one nothing. Meyerbeer entitles his grand opera "The Prophet" and it prophesies nothing. (metal clattering) (somber music) I can no more write operas than I can fly to Paris without the aid of wires from a gridiron. (Richard groans) I know you have come to encourage me. I know. I know you mean well, I know. I swing, I am suspended, Minna. I am neither here nor there. I wait for times to change and try to change times by the essays I write which you dismiss thus. There is a Mrs. Ritter who has a son she wishes to be a musician. A composer, I fear, of operas. She and another lady have offered to finance me while... Oh, Minna. - [Minna] Not yet. How we've missed you. - Yes. Mademoiselle Minna Planer. The beautiful, unattainable actress I paid court to for two years and two months before she would have me. You must not have another child. - No. I must never. I must remind you, Richard, that if I am barren, as I am barren, it is because your child died before it could be born while we fled from your creditors, pursued by Cossacks. - Maybe. - To have another child would mean my death. - Yes. - Never to have had sufficient money. Never. It is so graceless. - What would you have me do? - Work as others work. - Well, I give concerts. I concertize for pitiful sums of money. (Richard sighs) Is there something to eat? - Tomorrow there will be, thank God. And Liszt? - I thank Liszt. Oh, I am your child, Minna. - I sometimes think so. Richard? Why must you take money from this woman? - Mrs. Ritter? Because she offers it and she has it. She's English, I think. Or it's the other one, one of them is. - Is it beneath your dignity to earn money rather than borrow it? These pamphlets and essays you write. They waste your time. You're a conductor of concerts. Conduct them. You're a writer of music. Write it. So that we can live. - Mm, Liszt wants me to go to Paris. He thinks I should, hm? I'm grateful to Liszt, but he needs me more than I need him. He is, after all, a performer, hmm? The darling of the salons. They watch his hands on the piano and imagine them up their skirts. - Richard! (Richard sighs) - But he sees the music of the future. He sees it. He sees the fusion of music and drama, dimly, as I see it. Very dimly. Which is why I can't write anything that will please you. The form eludes me. (gentle music) I know it. Greek, vast amphitheaters. Life and worship in their art. Sensual performances understood by everyone. Slaves, masters, all equal in intellect. Equal in sensitivity. Same tongue, same myths. Instantly accessible through shared desires, experience, food, even. The same simple attic food. Milk, wine, olives. The same women, enjoyed by master and slave alike in the same open manner. Music is feminine. It lies waiting to be fertilized, the dramatic seed thrust into it. Words, taken up and carried further by the music. But poetry... Poetry is the reason for music. And drama is the reason for both. (somber music) (wind whooshing) (fire crackling) (crows cawing) Paris? Paris is for Meyerbeer and his vapid nonsense for which he earned in royalties for one opera some 750,000 marks last year. Whereas I got 900 marks for the entire rights of "Rienzi." - I told everyone you were commissioned to write something for Paris. It was announced in the Dresden papers. - Why? - So I should not be ashamed of you. - Ah, yes, yes. Meyerbeer is in Paris and is afraid of being buried alive, given instructions that bells should be tied to his toes when he goes. (sighs) He fears suffocation after death. I am in terror of it happening now. While I live. Oh, heavens. I have seen a theater of flames. (somber music) (wheel creaking) - Liszt does "Lohengrin"? - [Richard] Yes, something. - Lohengrin, the King of the Fairies. (giggling) You remember. Lohengrin, the swan knight, a fairy. - Mm? - Silk? How on earth have you managed to afford silk? - What? - You've sent me no money for weeks. - I always try, Minna. - Yes, you do. - But silk. - Oh, it isn't paid for. Minna, you know I can't wear anything but silk. - Oh, Richard. - Mitzel, Liszt suggested that the court at Weimar might pay me a yearly sum. A nice house might be found for you. "Lohengrin" might be given in English. London might do it. You were right, Mitzel, my old love, my dear old love. Minna, the beautiful actress laid low by the madman Wagner. I must get something for Paris. What do you say to Wieland the Smith? Shall your old Richel do that? I know you think I should settle to a decent living, not live off other people. I've been offered a few francs a year to write something by a lady from Edinburgh who lives in Bordeaux. She and Frau Ritter met her daughter in Dresden. Jessie Taylor, called Laussot now, married a young wine merchant. He was on his beam ends. If her mother can put money into wine, why not into Wieland the Smith, what? Where is there a blacksmith, where? I need to hear the sound of metal being struck. I must learn to forge metal. - And I must learn to walk. (dramatic music) Richard, your words, your ideas fill me with confusion, love. - [Richard] Yes, love. - [Jessie] I give it you, freely. - Jessie, I know. (gentle music) Wieland the Smith. You are his bride, chained, iron-chained and waiting for him to strike off the chains. - [Jessie] I do feel that. (knuckles rapping) - Enter. (door clicking) Did you enjoy your walk, Mr. Wagner? The sea near Bordeaux is very bracing. - (sighs) Madam, I find it not within me to enjoy anything at the moment. I fear for my health. - Oh, how distressing. Did Jessie tire you? - No, no, she... She, she was an inspiration. - I'm so pleased. - Is the sea air of Bordeaux helping you to recover from that which has brought you so low? - Thanks also to you, sire, and to your beautiful young wife and to Mrs. Taylor and, of course, we must never forget Frau Ritter who brought us all together. - [Mrs. Taylor] She is a good friend, a discerning woman. - I see that your Dresden friends have been sentenced to death for their part in the uprising. - [Richard] Yes. - [Jessie] Unthinkable. - I must, you must go to her. - Yes. - (sighs) I was overcome. - You are not now, overcome? - I am recovered. - Yes, well. Well, we are all upset at the thought of what might be lost to the world should Mr. Wagner have been took up by the Dresden authorities and so dealt with. - Yes, it is well known that my part in the events was that of a mere spectator. - [Eugene] An innocent laid bare. A bystander. - They were, are, for a few days more, my friends. Where will they go? What will they find? Is there a heavenly place for them, a shrine? A mossy bank? I've tried to explain my feelings, have written to them in simple hope that they will allow me into their last... I have told them that I am protected by the most blessed friendship and love. Am I not in the bosom, the bosom, that place where love lurks waits to do its healing? I tell them nothing of the financial plight I am in. I tell them that, however with renewed hope and fresh strength to my, in my wings I am carrying on, going where they would wish in my own way and according to my own powers, refleshed the work for which they, supple-limbed heroes, are laying down their lives. - They are? - Is there no hope of reconciliation between yourself and the authorities, Mr. Wagner? Shall you never be reinstated in your position in Dresden? - That, madam, I do not desire and with your money, which you've so generously offered to remit me it is not necessary for me to be a servant ever again. I shall go to the east. - What an excellent idea. - East of where? Mrs. Taylor, with the 3,000 francs a year, I will use it for, I will use half of it to provide for my wife. - Oh. - How far east did you have in mind? (gentle music) (door clicking) - I am going with him. - With whom? - [Jessie] I'm vital to his development as an artist. - So, too, you will find, am I. I would remind you that I have saved your husband from bankruptcy. I am delighted to help Mr. Wagner as well but to not to cut my hands like a groom so that he might more easily mount the mare. - I have never loved Eugene. - No, daughter, but I have. (Jessie screams) Vital to his development indeed! (suitcase banging) (door thuds) - I shall shoot the fellow should he dare to show his face in Bordeaux ever again. I shall indeed! (speaking in foreign language) (somber music) (people chattering) (horse hooves clopping) (gentle music) (chickens clucking) - Stop! (knuckles rapping) - Yes? (knuckles rapping) Yes? - You are Richard Wagner of Dresden? - I am. If you are here to dun me, a bailiff, I'm getting money. I have a letter of credit from a friend in Weimar. The composer and pianist, Franz Liszt. I expect-- - Please, please. - It is not money? - It is by nature of being political, touching on state and power, which I am encouraged, as a guardian, to pursue with zest and power and to ask you these several questions. Might I put them to you now, hmm? (Richard sighs) Why have you come back to Paris? What have your reasons been, apart from romantic, for being in Bordeaux? And have you tried to communicate with any here on the list? - List? - The list here given of known revolutionary-inclined persons in alphabetical order. - I was only a spectator. - Read it carefully, Herr Wagner, and when you have finished, I will escort you from Paris. Ah. Tannhauser. (laughs) Now, this is splendid. Revolutionary, one might say. I am by way of being an amateur musician myself. - I am told that my friends are to be executed in Dresden. Rockel, the others. Do you know, are they dead? - They are not now to be executed, merely imprisoned though I would execute them, for I am implacable as you were. - [Richard] One should be. - Herr Wagner, might I warn you, you are marked and will be watched while you are on the list and every country has its own list and its own influential people who need only to denounce you as behaving suspiciously, as in Bordeaux, for instance. Hm, hm? - Mrs. Taylor, or was it Mrs. Ritter? Her son Karl has the makings of a very fine musician. Well, no, he hasn't the makings of a very fine anything. But, for the sake of 3,000 francs a year. (both laughing) - Hmm. Might I take this? - Please do. - With a signature? - Where am I to go? Herr Wagner, you may go where you wish but you may not go to Bordeaux, where you were going. A signature. - [Richard] I was going east. - I am told that your wife will arrive any day in Paris. - Wife? Wife, my wife writes to me, asking that I should not use any form of familiarity or affection in my correspondence with her. In my letters, I should address her formally, as to a stranger met in the street. Wife? - Might I suggest, Herr Wagner, that for your safety you should move on perhaps, say, to Switzerland? - [Richard] Yes. (Richard sighs) (Richard groans) (dog barking faintly) (dramatic music) - [Andrew] Switzerland was congenial to Wagner. He suffered from ill health all his life and, like others before him, thrashed his body with healthy pursuits, in Switzerland with Minna, with two pupils taken in to earn a modest living. One of them was Hans von Bulow, a law student from Leipzig. The other, Karl Ritter, the son of Frau Ritter here in Dresden. At whose house Wagner had first met Jessie Laussot. He had rowed a boat one day across from Lucerne to the William Tell chapel. In the boat, Franz Liszt, Wagner's foremost champion, always. (dramatic music) - [Richard] My dear friend, my dear friend. What it is to have you with us. (dramatic music) - Why does he smile so? - He's happy. - Is he? No, Wagner, the gentleman is very wealthy. - Which gentleman? - The gentleman I tell you of. - Oh, that? It would be difficult for me. - I have taken considerable trouble with the hereditary Grand Duchess Sophie and she is becoming a most accomplished prima donna assoluta, as it were. - As it were? - Well, she can sing (speaking in foreign language). (both laughing) I think the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha will pay you well for scoring his new opera. - My dearest, I'm sure he will and so he should. What was his last opera called, "Tony"? - Yes, "Tony," yes. He's particularly intent on copying your magnificent use of trombone. - Is he, who? - Le Duc de Coburg. - Who is your dear friend and patron. - Yes, he's a close relative of Grand Duke Carl. - And a dolt. - Pardon? - Only a dolt would copy the use of trombones. - [Franz] He asked me to find out your rules in this respect that he might apply them in his own work. - [Richard] Work, he has no work. What a doltish question. How can you ask me such a doltish question, Liszt? (speaking in foreign language) - I assured my royal patron that I would. - Did you? Well, you tell him this, then. Tell the royal buffoon that I never use a trombone unless I have an idea for a trombone. One just doesn't use trombones. Tell him also that I am searching for a prince who will support me not through my work on whatever work he may be amusing himself with. I want a prince who will support me undemandingly, unconditionally, unquestioningly. By which I mean money, Liszt, money, money, money, Liszt. All I want is money. Love, I abandon, and art. - And politics? - Ah, politics has abandoned me. (dramatic music) - Why do you smile when I talk of Goethe? He smiled all through lunch when we discussed Goethe, why? - Because I have a deep admiration of Goethe. - Do you? And for France? If you are not prepared to accept that France is the cultural leader of Europe then you are a baboon. You certainly grin like one. - Never, never argue with Liszt about Goethe or the French. I never do, Karl. (Franz laughing) (dramatic music) (people laughing) (people chattering) - Karl, you must not. - My dear Frau Wagner, I must demand, and get, an apology from him. - Liszt is one of the kindest, gentlest of men. He would not dream of insulting you. - I have communicated the outrage to my mother. He called me a baboon. Baboon face. - Surely it isn't all that important, surely not. - Yes, it is, it is. I am to be married. I cannot be treated in this way. - Marry, ought you to, Ritter? - Ladies and gentlemen, this telegraph has been received from Weimar. It is a poem to mark the occasion of Liszt's birthday. It will be read by one of our own poets, Georg Herwegh. (audience applauding) = "The Lovers Blessed" by Hofmann von Fallesleben. In every nest where lovers dwell Togetherness-- - Karl is very upset, Richard. - Is he? - When he was a boy, he was teased unmercifully and called baboon face . - Was he? - [Georg] Spring begets each mother's dwelling, with fresh, green blooms. - The young fool isn't going to make a scene, is he? - So may we each stretch out our hand as we are led to the better land. (audience applauding) (dramatic music) (singing in foreign language) (people chattering) - Wagner, Wagner! Is it often that you have to play for your supper anywhere? Wagner, well done, far too well done. I would much rather these things be done badly. - Francois! - In what respect? - In every respect, that I better form my opinions. - Ah. - How can one correctly appreciate and criticize when seduced by the excellence of Frau Heim and yourself? - [Richard] Yes, yes, and Liszt. - Oh, I think Liszt played badly. One could see the genius, of course, but. - Frau Wills, I am concerned as to your-- - [Frau Wills] Pardon? - Heine? - Has the poet Heine, the great German poet, Heine-- - Madame, I am aware-- - Heine? - Has Heine been of any influence in Herr Wagner's-- - Wagner? It is the birthday of Liszt. - I have the highest regard for the poet. - We think very little of the poet, Heine. - Oh, but Princess, Heine has captured the German people. - Karl, you must not make a scene. You must not, I will speak to Liszt and make him aware of your feelings. I am sure he will apologize in his own way, quite possibly by letter. - I shall demand an apology now. If I do not get one, my mother shall not give you another penny. - No, no, wait! - Why talk about Heine? - Surely his name will be inscribed in the temple of immortality. - I suppose so. In shit. - Are we not making too much of it? After all, the boy does look very like a baboon, doesn't he? (people chattering) (people laughing) - For years, I had in mind the story of a young man, a boy of great charm, of great charm and beauty. Without beauty, there's nothing. My Siegfried is above all those things. Beautiful, no knowledge of fear. A boy too stupid to learn fear. - Whenever I have the opportunity to hear the Master play, I am conscious of the gift God has given him. - Too kind. - We should all pray our thanks to God the Creator. - I abase myself before you, ma chere. - What is Siegfried's guardian like? Well, one, small and bent of course, deformed, and he hobbles. His head is huge, a great bald head with his small and shark-like glancing eyes going to the soul. Festooned with a gray beard. The embodiment of evil. He does, of course, resemble us to a hair. - In Weimar, I am told they plan to institute a festival of music, opera and art for to enjoy the whole people of Germany and also to cultivate. - [Franz] Yes, one would hope so. - A transformation is needed. Music must go through a real transformation. What is needed more than anything, however, is a transformation in theater. Listen to me, damn you! Damn you! Listen to me! (glass crashing) I'm Wagner! (somber music) (wind howling) - [Karl] Herr Wagner. - [Andrew] In 1851. - [Karl] Herr Wagner! - [Andrew] Wagner's health gave out entirely. - [Richard] Come on Ritter, you must keep up, come on! Semper, where are you? - Entirely. He was forced to spend two months in a sanatorium to take the water cure, to stride the mountains when fit enough but he suffered from shingles, you see. He suffered from constipation. He suffered also from gastric ulcers but most of all he suffered from black, hounding despair. He had written no music for almost five years. If he could but return to Germany. But he could not. He was still listed here in Dresden as a revolutionary criminal but Semper, the architect of the barricades, joined him and another revolutionary friend, Hermann Muller and there was always the pupil, Karl Ritter, upon whose money or rather that of his mother, Frau Ritter, Wagner depended. They tried to cheer him on his trudges through the snow above the clouds and sometimes did. He wrote somewhere, "Determined I shall return to Zurich to die, or to compose." (triumphant music) - [Karl] I am on the point of vomit! - [Richard] Altitude, you were not given a head for heights, Ritter. He is some help. Liszt has recommended someone else, a young man, Bulow. He may be more, but this one's mother pays well, Semper. Pays well, Semper! Look at it. Every theater should tumble before this and come the day when every German theater does tumble, you and I, you with your plans, I with my ideas, we come up here and hurl rocks we cannot yet heft with such strength that they will reach the banks of the Rhine and, there, slot into place. We'll blow horns to call our friends together and perform three dramas in the course of a week which shall proclaim the artwork of the future. - Got away, by the very nick. The nick. I am now without money and a refugee. I haven't a penny to spare. Not one, not one. - Neither have I, I'm destitute. - Not entirely. - I am given to rages. - I am covered with the most beastly rash. - I'm writing a play. - I suffer from pressure of the blood. - I also, yes, yes, and more than that. An alarming, feverish activity. Here. For my shingles, I have been taking sulfur. So much so that I sweat sulfur. Doctors, they give me poisons. - I'm not convinced that this water is the answer. (somber music) - [Man] This opera, composing and such, are you still at it? - [Richard] I am. - [Man] Do you still hope for change? - No, I do not hope for change. There is no hope for change. The world is only of physical, no moral, significance. Then why seek to change it? - Down, gentlemen, please. (bell ringing) (dramatic music) - (sighs) I confess, I do not understand one word of Herr Schopenhauer. - Oh, do you not? - Herr Wagner thinks it's very important. He's read this book five times in the last nine months. Have you read it? (bell ringing) - Down, gentlemen, please. (Karl coughing) - I think it impresses him because it fortifies his own view of himself, a genius, some would say a madman. But given the superfluity of knowledge and artistic insight beyond the normal trivialities of paying bills and earning a living and, it would seem, breathing. (bell ringing) - Suicide, the supreme assertion of the will. Sacrifice and denial of the will to live. Stay down, all of you! I must live on and suffer. (Karl gasping) (dramatic music) (bell tolling) (dramatic music) (bell tolling) (gentle music) (bell tolling) (gentle music) (anvil clanging) (fire crackling) (dramatic music) (wind whooshing) (fire crackling) (anvil clanging) (fire crackling) - [Bird] Naughty Richard, poor Minna. (tool tapping) - [Richard] In the mornings, I work. In the afternoons, I walk, you? - I work through the night into the morning, until I am exhausted. - [Richard] I would ask you to work in the afternoons and be exhausted in the morning. - Why? - I am Richard Wagner. - Success to you. I am a gunsmith. - I've never had need of guns. - The pen being mightier than the sword? - Beating swords into plowshares. - So long as man strives he makes mistakes. - Every man is worth studying carefully, but not every man is worth talking to. Good day, sir. (tools tapping) (dramatic music) (birds chirping) (dramatic music) - [Pfeuffer] I often think a rich merchant such as yourself is allowed his prosperity, Wesendonck, that he might come to the aid of fine artists such as Herr Wagner. - [Otto] I can find money for Wagner but I would suggest that his wife be asked to control that which we find for him. Where is she? - I am told she is sickly, in Dresden. Frau Wagner. - Herr Wagner is, in fact, a financial genius. - You mean, in that he obtains money? - In that he persuades money. - Now, his wife-- - Otto, were I Wagner I would hate to have my affairs handled by my wife. Indeed, any gentleman would find it intolerable, though, of course, in the case of Herr Wagner, hmm. Do you know he borrowed $1,000 from that booby, Ritter? Yes, his mother already remits Wagner a stipend for the musical education of the boy as well as in appreciation of Wagner's genius. - He is that. My own wife tells me he is. And my sensibility confirms it. One person who does not appear to know this is Wagner's own wife. She sends him into despair, I'm told. Will not live with him one minute, cannot do without him the next. (sighs) I thank heaven for quiet order in my own household. Frau Wagner, she simply doesn't understand the way he writes and writes and cudgels his brains to shreds. You know, it's not merely opera. It's not merely music. That man just, well, he wants to change everything. But of course Wagner is music. - Wagner, we discuss your finances. - Oh, yes? - Yes. On trust that I shall be paid back from future fees from your operas I shall let you have 7,000 francs which I trust will expunge your debts. - My dear Wesendonck, I am grateful to you. There is also the small matter of some 500 francs, I'd hoped to cover it with a fee for "Lohengrin" to be paid tomorrow, or they will throw me out of my humble (laughs) can't sell the furniture. Frau Wagner would never forgive me, did I do that. She has taken the cure. I expect her any day. Yes, yes, 500 francs. Liszt does "Lohengrin" in Weimar. Do you know I have never seen it? Yes. Nothing to do with her! Nothing, the threads came together, that's all. Nothing at all to do with her! Nothing, nothing to do with Mathilde Wesendonck! (gentle music) No, no, no, never. There was nothing she gave me except a summer house at the bottom of her garden. That's all I had from her. Nothing to do with her. I'm sorry, Minna. Sorry, sorry for what I did to you. Sorry, Minna. Minna. Sorry, Minna. A house and garden on my own. (sighs) A haven of calm at last. This shall be my last move of all. - Wagner, my dear friend! I have something to show you. - [Richard] Ah, of course I shall pay you rent. - [Otto] Of course. - [Richard] And I shall never put on livery again. How I detested those breeches and those stockings and those buckled boots. Most insulting to a man. Now it is silk. Do you know, Herr Wesendonck? You must know, you sell silk. You must know how important silk is to me. It is the only thing I can wear. I'm mortified beyond endurance if forced to wear anything else next to my skin.. Covered in scrofula, only the finest stuff. And you would know the finest stuff, would you not. How well you have done from silk. And here you see me, who cannot live without it. (birds chirping) (bells tolling) (gentle music) It's Good Friday. - It isn't, church bells are not rung on Good Friday. - Yes, it is, yes, it is. Yes, it is. - Well? - [Richard] Well? Isn't it better here? - Yes. - [Richard] Aren't you happy here? - I had a letter from Doctor Pusinelli in Dresden. - [Richard] Yes, how is the dear man? - He thinks I take too much laudanum. - [Richard] I think that. - You still owe him a great deal of money. He works for your reinstatement. - What? - That you might be taken back. - [Richard] Back? - As Kapellmeister, it's my dearest wish. - Not too much laudanum. (gentle music) - What have you there? - It's a gold pen, given to me by Frau Wesendonck. - How kind. How kind. - [Richard] I see thee in thy gorgeousness, hear all those who will never understand what we are to each other. Those who strangers are, yet near to us, how dare they speak to us, speak between us? They voyage the questing, the voyaging we do, you and I, my sweet child. Though dreams of you crowd in, set sail with me. Does my dear muse stay afar still? In silence I await your visit, send you my barque to transport you. Together in our boat we voyaged, no longer was I alone, a lonely heart, no longer the Dutchman, wherever you are. - [Mathilde] Everyone loves you. You love many. Your being as the sun is shown, whose smile brings every joy and blessing. My heart loves you and you alone. So tenderly, so heart to heart, you kissed me in my dream. I feel it still, that love-true kiss, awakened though I seem. And yet in life my waiting mouth your lips have scarce brushed o'er. No look, no cry revealed to you how sad my heart and sore. O, do not scorn the dream that gives high courage to my mood. Life looks on me with hateful eyes, the dream alone is good. Then what is falsehood, what is truth? What life, and what dream stuff? Let me go dreaming on and on for I have lived enough. Mathilde Wesendonck. (door thuds) (knuckles rapping) (gentle music) - [Minna] What does that creature spoilt by happiness mean to you? - Minna, please, you must understand she means everything. - [Minna] That poor man. - I don't understand. - You treat him like a servant. She treats me like a person unfit to meet socially. - You imagine everything. - I see. Very well, I shall go away. You must stay and make an honest woman of her. (Richard sighs) (gentle music) (birds chirping) Here is another letter come. (Minna gasping) (Minna groaning) - [Richard] You're not well. (piano chiming) - [Minna] No. (gasping) Not at all. - [Richard] This cannot continue. - [Minna] (gasping) No, it cannot. What is that? - A drawing, a sketch. - Where does it go? - To Frau Wesendonck. - No, it doesn't! (door thuds) (Richard sighs) - Minna. Minna! Please try to behave properly in front of the servants. Such behavior is not understood especially by people like the Wesendoncks. They don't live that kind of life. Such behavior is unknown to them. You are surely ill. - You cannot talk me round any more. - Our intercourse has never violated morals, Minna. Minna, do you hear? Minna! I shall not deny our love, but it is chaste. Has never become carnal. (sighs) (singing in foreign language) My wife, were she well, would thank you as I do, for your kindness in giving me luncheon. Dear God, how I wish they'd leave my work alone. If they can't, why do they think to please me by this? (sighs) My God, I regret ever having-- - Surely it is better to have it given-- - What do you know about it, Wesendonck? What? Do I presume to tell you about silk? How much in length? If the conversation touched upon the merchandising of silk, would you ever hear utterance from me? (singing in foreign language) I cannot go on with it. I cannot see a way forward. I'm stuck with it, "The Ring". (singing in foreign language) I'm in a parlous state for money. Parlous, once again, I have none. How it goes. Those who said they would publish me now say they will not. So I am advanced nothing, nothing, nothing at all, not a coin, though it is read, published and read, and even performed in parts, in the bushes. (laughs) I need money now, a performance now. I shall write a popular work for ready money. This woman, this beautiful creature, who has come into my life to be my muse. We must come to some agreement about her. Some arrangement must be made. I think we should share her, hm? (somber music) - You use my house as your own. I am put out. I would wish to have said this to you in private, but there you have it. Now said in company where I would not wish to have said it. - Otto knows about our affection. I have no secrets from him, the father of my children. - Quite so, quite so. Do you know what is being done in your house, Otto? What it is we do together? The Legend of Tristan and Isolde. A simple work. Our constant companion, these months, Mathilde and I. Our love interwoven with the love of Tristan and Isolde. For the Emperor of Brazil, he asked for it. He will build a theater in Brazil. Semper designs it. I shall put Tristan and Isolde into it. (man screaming) I am going blind. Blind, blind, blind. (coughing) Blind, blind, agony. (dramatic music) (footsteps thudding) (fire crackling) (crowd murmuring) (anvil clanging) Nothing to do with her. The threads came together, that's all, nothing at all to do with her, nothing, nothing at all to do with Mathilde Wesendonck. Yes? - Another dog? - Yes, given us by Otto. (Minna laughing) (horse hooves clopping) (birds chirping) My dear fellow! My dear fellow, how wonderful to see you. How do you do? - How nice. - Of course. - Of course. - More important than that. Can I introduce? - [Minna] Dear Hans, you have been in Berlin. How I envy you, you must tell us all. Your work, how well does it go? - More important than that, can I? - [Richard] My dear Hans, now we shall work. - Did you abandon the law altogether? - Can I introduce my bride? My bride. - A honeymoon. They want to spend it with us. - Where else? (bird squawking) - That piano is-- - From Paris. The only worthwhile object to come out of that sink, that pit, given to me by the Widow Erard. Frau Bulow, your husband plays my rough drafts as if they were already set down for the piano. We shall make a lot of music. A lot. - You'll be hungry. - Minna will see that you keep quiet in the mornings. Then in the afternoon and for the rest of the day, we shall be with the Wesendoncks and we shall all make music together, all of us. All of us, I am so pleased to see you. - Yes. What can I do, copying, anything? - No, no. (quiet gentle music) How does "The Ring" come, "Valkyrie"? - That you should marry the daughter of Liszt, it is splendidly round and come together. There are times when things do come together, have completeness. (laughs) I am so pleased, but then you know that. Minna, feed them. (gentle music) (birds chirping) The light, the light. Oh, this light. How long before it was extinguished? The sun had set, the day had died, but its spite was unquenched. It kindles the signal that holds me at bay and sets it up by my beloved's door, so that I may not make my way to her. - What are your feelings, Baronet? Mine are that I'm overwhelmed by the beauty of the verse and the emotion. (gentle music) - I. (dramatic music) (door thuds) (Minna screaming) - Frau Wagner. - [Minna] Frau Wesendonck. I have, I am here to tell you of my husband. - You are? - I've come to warn you of the inevitable consequences of your relationship with my husband. - Please, I would rather you did not. - I face separation from my husband, a man I have lived with for 22 years. I've been mistress of his household. I am the person to whom you should hold the utmost respect. I am wife to once the most respected composer in Germany, who has in the past done wonderful things, been Kapellmeister to the King of Saxony, a position of some worth. I have been beautiful. Was ravishing. Was worn down by his constant attention. Only this made me marry him. But I have had to support him for years. I have been in the way of becoming a very successful actress. I gave it up. Gave everything up to become the wife of Richard Wagner. You have not anything you have given to him. Nothing! - Frau Wagner, your husband treats everything as his own, including my house. - Richard is in these things quite shameful. No, no, I do believe he does not even consider it. Everything is put in the world for him to use. He regards the denial of anything he might consider necessary to him, a house, money, creature comforts, people. He regards such denial as wicked, quite simply wicked. He calls to me and says this. Minna, we must separate. Frau Wesendonck who admires me, with whom I am passionately in love, cannot stand our remaining together. She cannot stomach you, your sickliness, your lack of children, your barren womb. This is not touching on my state. It is your vulgar letters, the undermining of my position. I am sick and ill and cannot sleep unless I'm, if I were a common woman, I would show your letters to that poor man, your husband, that he might judge. Then my husband can return to his work. From which he has been kept so shamefully! (Minna sobbing) (dramatic music) (wheels rattling) (horse hooves clopping) (gentle music) (water lapping) (birds cawing) - [Andrew] Almost penniless again, seeking somewhere to work undisturbed so that he might get "Tristan and Isolde" down in some shape, Wagner chose to go to Venice at an agreeable time of the year, or so he hoped. When he got there he found it gloomy. The gloom about him reinforced the gloom within him. Liszt had advised him not to go to Venice. Liszt was probably right. But here he was, with his piano and determined to work, could he but find lodgings, peace, quiet. And he was ill again with dysentery. And he was still on the list of wanted revolutionaries. Venice, part of the Austrian Empire, should have been safe, but all empires distrust restless men who find their names on lists, and Wagner knew it. He saw the crumbling buildings between the buildings, the steady lap, lap, lick, lick of the water on the stone and he sank deeper and deeper into himself, until he could stand it no longer and demanded the biggest apartment that could be found. Hang the expense. Space was what he needed. Hang the gloom. He would fill the space with warmth, his warmth. His energy must be the source. He would report to the Chief of Police and get it over just as soon as he found somewhere. - Herr Wagner, Herr Wagner, you are come in search of rooms, sir? Not here, not here, sir. Next door, if you would be so pleased, sir. - Unhand me, sir. - Through here, Herr Wagner. Large but not too large, I fancy. Are you intent on a long stay? There is the matter of references. - These walls, are they filthy or are they just afflicted by the gloom? Grey, hangings, I must have hangings. And what furniture is there? - A small deposit, Herr Wagner. (dramatic music) (bell tolling) (bright music) - Art and Revolution. Judaism in Music. Opera and Drama. A Communication To My Friends. Sieg? - [Richard] Siegfried. - Siegfried's Death. And your health, Herr Wagner? - I improve, sir. - Our Chief of Police of Vienna says I am to send you packing as soon as your health improves. Venice being under rule of Austria, I am obliged to comply with the requests to have your letters inspected. As well as a discreet watch on those that have come under suspicion of revolutionary intentions. Because I admire you as an artist and a thinker, Herr Wagner, you shall not be inconvenienced during your stay here. (dramatic music) - Well done, gentlemen, rousing, rousing. - [Crowd] Bravo, bravo! - See what you can do with Verdi next. - [Man] Bravo! (dramatic music) - If you devote yourself exclusively to your profession, as the begetter of the so-called music of the future, then Venice is honored to have you, sir. And I shall say as much to that Austrian, indeed I shall. As for the Saxon authorities, they can go to hell. (bell tolling) You will be watched because I need to show my Austrian masters that I heed their instructions, but my agents will be told to help you, if they can. - Do they copy music? (dramatic music) (men shouting faintly) (bell tolling) (gentle music) (Robert screaming) Nothing to do with her! The threads came together, that's all. Nothing at all to do with her, nothing. Nothing at all to do with Mathilde Wesendonck. In my presence. Do you know the story, Doctor? Tallemant, the anecdote of the duchess and the doctor. The doctor bleeding the duchess, and while he was doing it she came to her senses and told him he was an insolent fellow. How dare he have bled her in her presence? (laughing) (bell tolling) - Permit me, sir, I am Dolgorukow. Herr Wagner-- - I am your servant, sir. Zichy is my name. - Yes, we are both full of admiration for your work. We have seen everything of yours, everything. - I have not seen "Lohengrin" yet. Not been given the chance. - [Dolgorukow] "Lohengrin," yes, we saw that in Vienna. - [Zichy] "Tannhauser" we saw in Berlin. - [Dolgorukow] Yes, the greatest public success given to it. - [Zichy] Yes. - [Dolgorukow] Sir, you will be transported with delight when you can find time to visit somewhere where it is being given. - [Zichy] Does Karlsruhe not give it? - [Dolgorukow] I believe they do. You may catch it in Karlsruhe, Herr Wagner. - [Zichy] Yes. - [Dolgorukow] I would be so interested in your reaction. Do you feel it is not necessary to see your work given? - [Zichy] I saw Tannhauser in the rain. Indeed, it did not spoil my enjoyment one bit. At the summer theater, Lerchenfeld, the rain came down and I left, but I had, up to that moment of my departure, been transported. - Had you really? - Yes, indeed. Shall you give anything here, Herr Wagner, in Venice? - We leave tomorrow. - Yes. (gentle music) (water lapping) (triumphant music) (upbeat music) - [Richard] Where have you been, Ritter, these last months? You've left your wife? I have needed money. What is this of you and Cosima von Bulow? - Well, it was a shock. The daughter of Liszt married to my, to our friend von Bulow, out on the lake. - What are you babbling about? - Baron von Bulow. - Who? - Out on the lake she threatened to drown herself. For love, for me. - You? (sighs) Liszt is gone from Weimar, so we can't expect anything from him any more. He tells me Tristan is a delight to him. - You said my Tristan was wrong. - What? Oh, God, now they re doing "Rienzi." Salute him, salute him. (laughs) I sometimes get a meal from the officers of his regiment. What Tristan? - I tried to write the-- - So you did, that was wrong, very wrong. You don't know anything about, about. The sooner they go off and fight the French, the better. Give the French "Tannhauser," boys. There is to be a war, Karl. (upbeat music) - My Tristan was not that bad an idea. - You poor booby. - Herr Wagner, I must warn you, my family has very little money left. We cannot continue to give you any more money. - Well, why can't you sell something? Oh, very well. My God, you are so tiresome, all of you. When will you understand? Money, money, money, that's all I want from you and Liszt. Both of you, tiresome. I shall go back to my true friends the Wesendoncks. Do not follow me to Switzerland unless you're prepared to put your hand in your pocket some more. Tell your mother that. - See the amount I am owed for these curtains! And I am not the only person in Venice owed money by Herr Wagner. - Months of rent he owes me. What has he left me in payment? Paper, paper! Take back your hangings. I don't want 'em, have 'em. - "Tristan And Isolde." (laughs) Will he dedicate it to me, do you think? (dramatic music) (horse whinnying) (footsteps crunching) (singing in foreign language) (gentle music) - Your destination, Herr Schultz? - Paris, why not? (somber music) (singing in foreign language) - [Otto] My dear fellow, how good to see you. - Wesendonck. "Tannhauser", Wesendonck, in Paris. They want to do it, offer me a contract. Paris at last. The Emperor himself, very interested in German opera ever since his war with Austria. I was in Venice when the Austrian army was marched away. They went off playing "Tannhauser." (laughs) Well, the Emperor beat them, but has become very pro-German since, I'm told. Do you know my piano got safely over the pass. Not a bit out of tune. Well, Tristan finished and already I'm thinking of a comedy. So, do you know about The Mastersingers? - [Otto] No. - Ah, a comedy, but full of melancholy. But to attack Paris the way the Austrians were not able to, I shall need funds. How is Frau Wesendonck? We've had some correspondence. I would hope to see her the longer my departure to Paris is delayed. - My dear Wagner-- - No, no, consider it an investment. Some small part of it in actual coin, if you would be so kind. And do give your wife my warmest greetings, (laughs) Wesendonck, my dear friend. - How much? - Oh, well, I (laughs). - How much? (Richard laughs) (gentle music) (birds chirping) - Yes, a ballet, we must have a ballet. I shall do something about the rather tame bacchanal in the first act. I've always thought I might make it more voluptuous, give Venus more, let us make Frau Venus a real woman. Eroticism, music to lay bare our most secret passions, our most sensual yearnings to incite our senses. Yes, yes. - Tasteful, I hope, tasteful. - Tasteful? Do you know, Monsieur Royer, this is the first time I've been in a theater, on the stage of a theater, for many years. - [Royer] In the first act. - [Richard] Yes? - You would put the ballet in the first act? - That's where it can go. In Paris, monsieur, the ballet is always placed in the second act, you know, where the gentlemen of the town can see it. In our experience, ballet in the first act is too early, in the third, too late. The gentlemen of the town have already gone elsewhere for their, their. No, no, a ballet in the first act will not attract the town. There you have it, Monsieur Wagner. Please meet Petipa. He will design your ballet. Please, he will explain. - Monsieur Wagner. - Petipa. - Monsieur Petipa is the ballet master. - Whoremaster. - Might one say, Herr Wagner, that in Paris, gentlemen dine at eight? - Well, the orchestra? - Competent, I think. Quite a number of them are German. - Well, there you are, they're the best in the world. - Because they dine at eight, they can repair to the opera in time for the second act, where they expect to find a ballet, as they will find tonight in "Nabucco," as you see. - You are ill-advised, Herr Wagner. - I never accept advice. - I advise you! - Oh, do you? - Oh, from my heart! - Ah, deep felt? - You, We're accustomed to a ballet in the second act in Paris. And the members of the Jockey Club, they will not accept your opera should it not have. Let me tell you this, Herr Wagner, without the Jockey Club's attention we are lost, lost, lost! And that is fact. - Is it? - Absolutely fact! - Ah, then which act will the emperor wish to see? If these gentlemen only wish to see a second act, I shall make that the best act. - I beg your pardon, the Emperor will wish to see the entire opera, of course. - Then entire he shall see it. Note on note, every sound, every note as I intend it, in the place I intend it to be. And that does not mean I shall give way to gentlemen who'd rather see Verdi in underthings, rather lech among the sprites than listen to them! How well does Verdi write second acts for brothels? Does he prosper? - [Man] Brothels? - [Richard] If they can do this to a revolutionary like Verdi, what are they going to do to me, Hans? Well, we ain't going to let them, Hans, not an inch do we give the whoremasters! (train whistling) (dramatic music) - It goes, it goes well. - It is a mistake, is it not, Richard? - I am beyond "Tannhauser." - [Minna] But it is yours, and you are given this opportunity to do it, here in Paris! (door thuds) What is this? - "Tannhauser." I'm revising the whole thing. Well, most of it. Indeed, some of it, the tone of it, its color. - Why? - So it'll seem the more sensual. - This? - Ah, a gift from an admirer. On Wednesdays I am at home. Minna, it might please you to attend. I now have a public position, which you, as wife, must share with me. But this part of the apartment is mine. - [Minna] I am your wife! - Yes, of course you are. - Well, where has the money come from? - That is no concern of yours. I must be able to receive people. My soirees are attended by brilliant and gifted people with influence. - [Minna] Women admirers? - Don't be silly! Admirers, supporters, subscribers. I cannot appear to be less than they. Meyerbeer gives money away by the cartload. As if it were done, which indeed it is. - [Minna] And you do not soil your hands in such dung, I take it? - These are going to be your rooms. I will expect you to stay in this part of the house. But I hope you will make an appearance when we have guests. Just an appearance. There's no need to be involved in anything. You, ah, you have a maid. - Two pianos? Where does the money come from? - I have a contract for nine months. I give concerts. - All these copyists! You were forced to work as a copyist once, now you employ them by the regiment! How can you pay for them? - They are paid, they are necessary. There is new music, a ballet. Much to be done between "Venus" and "Tannhauser" in French. If the music sticks, it's gonna be a devil of a job to change this back into German. - That awful "Venus," I'm never able to accept her! - No, and I doubt you ever will. - Are you given money by Wesendonck? - [Richard] I have been. - [Minna] And what are you given by his wife? - [Richard] I shall not suffer that again! Go to your rooms! I do not expect you to enter these rooms unless you are invited. - I must sit down. I feel faint. I would not wish you to be responsible for my death. (Richard huffs) (door thuds) (Minna crying) (dramatic music) - Yeah, go! No, stop! No! No, stop, stop, stop! No, no, no! Again, one, two. (bright music) One, one! Go, go, and go! Go! Yeah, go! More fire, go, go! Stop, stop, stop, stop! More fire! Passion! Gentlemen! - Gentlemen, gentlemen! - We are not Prussian soldiers, but free men! - Be so kind as to explain what you mean by that, sir. - Herr Wagner, the time has come to say to you, after interminable rehearsals, sir, some 100 or so to date, sir, we refuse to be drilled like Germans! Even those of us who are Germans! - I shall need more rehearsals from all of you, not less. I shall supply you with lunch and wine, and I shall pay you extra, out of my own pocket. - Bravo! - Bravo! - Bravo! - Bravo! - Bravo! - Yes, yes. (bright upbeat music) - [Hans] Sorry, my fault. (upbeat music) - I am Albert Niemann, I will sing "Tannhauser." - I'm Richard Wagner. This is my assistant, Hans von Bulow. - [Albert] Do you want me? - Mm, it is a thought. - I am the greatest! - I hear that you are. - Now, what's the fee? - I shall hear you first. - An audition, to give auditory trial! - Well. - I know the role backwards! - Interesting, interesting, how does that sound? (singing in foreign language) (dramatic music) (singing in foreign language) (dramatic music) (singing in foreign language) - By refusing to have a ballet in the second act, you have lost the services of the principal dancers. - That is so. - Why? - They will not appear. I can obtain for you three Hungarian dancers. - Monsieur Wagner, we beg of you, reconsider! - No, you will have your ballet, but it must be in the first act. I must portion it in the first act. - [Manager] You will play to an empty theater! - You are being used! - That does not happen to me. - There's more to this, "Tannhauser," political complexities. - I rejected politics, they're nothing to me. - It is even said that although France won the war, there was a secret clause in the peace treaty which imposed a production of "Tannhauser" on Paris. - Huh, a German opera, at the command of the French Emperor, influenced, some say, by an Austrian Princess Metternich. Can't imagine why. I've heard she can't tell a fugue from a flugelhorn. - [Hans] But you must have friends. - I've already been approached! I refuse, I refuse to employ them! - [Hans] Then you risk a great deal. (dramatic music) - All this concertizing, simply to make money! Bits and pieces, my dear, bits and pieces! - Herr Wagner, you deal with a Jewess. If you want money, you must sign a note! It is necessary! - Yes, in the case of such a person as Madame Schwabe it is certainly necessary. - Why, sir, would it not be? I lend you money. - You have taken a journey into the music of the future. Isn't that what he says? - Hmm. - You give me a promissory note. - Ah, I do indeed. For the sum of 3,000 francs. - The whole thing is too long! Too high and too long! The score must be cut, Herr Wagner! We are doomed to failure unless you cut, cut, cut! I shall want to get through my role as quickly as possible! * Mi, mi, mi, mi, mi My voice, you see! This is my opera, and unless you consider it so, then scout out for another Tannhauser! - Well, take it down an octave. Change a few notes. Anything, it's only music, after all. (dramatic music) (man groaning) Monsieur Royer, I must conduct the orchestra myself. I've had 164 rehearsals with the orchestra, and now, within days of giving my Tannhauser, I'm told I'm not allowed to conduct. Listen to it, do! - We must allow the music director of the opera house to conduct his own orchestra! - His orchestra, mine, I sharped it! And the corps de ballet is a disgrace! - Oh, it is! - It is not! - Indeed it is! - Look at that lumpish lump! - [Manager] Oh, yes! - I compose music for a wild dance, wild, bold, sensual. And look, what do I have? - Indeed! - If you could give a ballet in the second act, will you consider a dance intermezzo between acts so that-- - No, no, no! To show their charms to the admirers. (speaking in foreign language) - I am patronized by the Emperor. - Yes, simply because he wishes to placate the republicans by showing favor to one such as yourself! - It's because he's persuaded by Princess Metternich that he should hear Wagner after all these years. Wagner, do you understand? Paris is to see Wagner. Wagner, a serious and dedicated artist, among this! - There's always a grand dislike of the influence of Princess Metternich, who's Austrian. - I know she is Austrian. We speak the same language, to some extent. Ah, Petipa, I'm in despair. Look at that! (hand thuds) - Monsieur Wagner, I am the finest ballet master in the whole of France. - Monsieur Sax informs me there are not 12 French horns in the whole of Paris. - It is true. - Then they must be made. - What, I cannot do it in time! Might I suggest... - Petipa, don't you not understand what I've written? It is a bacchanal! - Yes, but if I try to do it, another to compete, I would need all the premier dancers, and even so, were I to ask of them to give that what you demand, the passion you expect, and your music indicates. Were I to, Monsieur Wagner, in their tutus, we would simply end with the can can. (French horn screeching) Cancan. (French horn screeching) - [Andrew] Paris is the center of the musical world. It cannot be helped. And Paris is not German. In Europe, a success in Paris is desirable. Scores sold, works taken up and given. Wagner was well aware of the importance of the occasion, well aware, as he faced his first opening night for 16 years. - Herr Wagner? - Sir? - I am here to wish you success. - Thank you. - [Man] You are sure of it. - Thank you. - I can guarantee it. - Sir, I do not intend to pay you anything. You or any other member of your claque. - Well, I can guarantee nothing. - I, however, can guarantee everything. (people chattering) (instruments tuning) I'm well aware that you, sir, have these in your pocket. - Do you talk to me, sir? - Herr Meyerbeer, I do talk to you. Would you wish me to speak in Hebrew so that your friends might understand? - (sighs) I've never borne you ill will, Herr Wagner. Indeed, when you were a younger man, I thought I had done you some service. - The service was indeed slight, but I thank you for what you did. I fancy any person of discrimination would have done the same. It was obvious that my work had to be recommended, even by you. - There is nothing wrong with packing the house with friends. - [Richard] I don't buy friends, or praise. - From what one hears, the flow of money goes one way only, Herr Wagner. I read your pamphlet on Jewry In Music. - [Richard] It was written with such as you in mind. - You used my name, several times. - [Richard] How did you find the argument? - I found it clever, but offensive. I prefer to consider it the work of a bitter and frustrated man. I shall ignore it. - I have had letters from unfortunate Jewish musicians who plead with me to show them a way out of their misery. Thus presented to them. - [Meyerbeer] You'll have no letters from me, sir. - [Richard] I take it you paid for your ticket? - One should always do one's best for one's fellow musicians. - [Richard] Allow me to reimburse you for what will probably be a disappointing evening for you. - Oh, come now, "Tannhauser" is quite a good piece. Overlong, but quite well-crafted. - It is wonderful and wonderfully given. It is all I would wish it to be. That will be your disappointment sir, tinkle, tinkle, tinkle! (coins clattering) (instrument squeaking) (gentle music) (people chattering) (gentle music) (horn squeaking) (people laughing) - [Minna Voiceover] Oh, the things that have happened to us in the past. I try to put them out of my mind, but they re always there at times such as these. Frightening, shameful, terrifying things. We have both fled. We have both been hunted down for debt, for intrigue, for debt. The Cossacks, always on our heels. I know, even at our moments of greatest security, even when success trembles. Please, please. (gentle music) (dog barking) (marbles rattling) (horn squeaking) (people laughing) (people whistling) (horse hooves clopping) (horns squeaking) (dramatic music) (crowd cheering) (dramatic music) - Get on with it, you idiot! (crowd yelling) (horn tooting) - [Minna] Oh God, not again, not again! (dramatic music) (horn tooting) (crowd yelling) (crowd whistling) (crowd yelling) (horns tooting) (singing in foreign language) (dramatic music) (singing in foreign language) (toy rattling) (crowd yelling) (crowd yelling) (crowd booing) - Well? - Politics. - Niemann wasn't good enough, was he? - Quite. (somber music) - [Richard] When you are recovered you must go to live in Dresden. - [Minna] Perhaps, you? - Not sure. Princess Metternich is attempting to obtain for me a passport. Perhaps I shall be allowed back in Germany at last. I shall not stay in Paris. Vienna, perhaps. - I hate the French above all others. Such disgusting behavior! - Yes. If I am accorded a passport, I will visit you. - As you wish. I intend to take the waters in Soden. - That I knew. I have it arranged with Pusinelli. - You despise me. - No. - I hate you. - Minerl, Minerl, you don't. - Perhaps. - Bulow is trying to persuade the Grand Duke of Baden to have me in Karlsruhe. I shall, I shall ask for a small pension. - Do we like Karlsruhe? - Perhaps. "Tristan and Isolde," perhaps. - That miserable moan. That disgusting moan! My husband wrote that, that filth, that drug, when he was besot with Mathilde Wesendonck. Culture carrion! And impossible to perform. I know, you will not find a singer to sing it, I know. - Maybe. - Richard. Promise me no more lewdness with women. No more infatuations with women like Frau Wesendonck, promise me. (gentle music) - Minerl. - You're cruel, heartless. I'm glad I'm going away. (train whistling) (train chugging) - [Richard] Bulow, what will you do now? - [Hans] I'm offered a post in Berlin. They think of starting an orchestra there. (laughs) Berlin, and you? - Switzerland, perhaps. I must leave Paris, that I know. Paris, look at it, Bulow. There's a market for anything in Paris. Even the leavings from the tables of the rich. Smuggled out by servants. Still sauced by their master's spit, no doubt. Back-door bones from restaurants. Paris won't pick on my bones, even if I have to concertize. Paris can afford anything, can buy anything. Anything, buy it and waste it. We are gentlemen of the three ins, Bulow. In debt, in danger and in poverty. Two are enough for any man. (dramatic music) - [Andrew] Wagner became a journeyman again, concertizing, seeking a settled existence, a place to work, a patron to pick up his bills, a theater to offer him welcome. Always in his mind there nagged a thought that somewhere there was a person with the vision and the courage to offer him everything he might need to realize his ideas. No state in Germany would open its doors to him. The insignificant princelings Wagner and his friends had challenged were banded against him. (dramatic music) Everywhere that he went, his piano went as well. But most of all, he needed time. Money to buy time. His operas were given, true, but the income from them was small. He was becoming increasingly desperate that he would never be given the chance to do the great work he knew would assure his place. But first he tried Switzerland again. Tried Wesendonck again. - [Otto] Your wife? - Not good. Yours? - [Otto] Frau Wesendonck? She enjoys excellent health. - Yes, good. - [Otto] And your health? - Mine? - [Otto] Your afflictions. - Yes, yes. (sighs) The usual. - Your skin. - What did you say? - [Otto] Hm? - I hope to complete "Siegfried." - [Otto] And for "Rheingold" and "Valkyrie"? - 24,000 francs would be an excellent investment. I do assure you, Otto, you will be the person who gains. "The Ring" is going to be a tremendous piece. You are to be my business partner insofar as "The Ring" is concerned. I'll throw in "Meistersinger." Soon finish that if I can get a pension and somewhere to live. - [Otto] Investment in what, Wagner? I already hold publishing rights to "The Ring". Investment in what? - In me. In me, damn you, in me. - Perhaps. Have you tried Vienna? On the other hand, I know any reputable money-lender would show you some courtesy on my encomium. - Thank you, Wesendonck, but I will not take money from those who have no conception of my worth. I'm not a swindler. (upbeat music) (people chattering) The Grand Duke of Baden is thinking of placing his theater at my disposal. - Is he? - That's why I'm here in Vienna. To look for singers for my opera "Tristan." - I shall see you don't find them. - Ah, but, Your Highness, I-- - Why not give us your opera here? - Ah, but-- - In Vienna we can do it so much better. - [Hanslick] Your Highness. - Hanslick, this is Herr Wagner. - Your Highness. - One of the most important critics in Vienna, Herr Wagner. - I have a great admiration for you, sir. - Dr. Hanslick is a very prominent critic. - I know him, ma'am. - My dear Wagner, we must all learn to deal with our critics. Artists and royalty are expected to smile. - [Richard] He has attacked me and my work "Tannhauser" viciously and persistently. He is a pedant, a time-server. One day I shall show him what he is. I'll put him in a synagogue. - My dear Wagner, the Grand Duke is not interested in "Tristan And Isolde." He is interested in you. He sees you as a political feather in his cap. He has told me as much. You are the German composer who was patronized by the Emperor Napoleon. You will find that carries a great deal of weight with minor German princelings. - Frau Kapellmeisterin. - Sir. - Herr Doctor, is that? - Yes. - He owes me money. - He owes us all money. - Is she ill? - Yes. She comes every day to petition the minister to allow Wagner back. - [Ritter] Were we not all revolutionaries? I ask you that. I was his oboist, heaven help me. I sought change, heaven help me. (gentle music) - I really want to help, but. - [Richard] Well, if there's nothing in Berlin, I may as well try Russia. - Tristan? - In Vienna, with the Princess? Hopeless, I continue to work on it. It's a simple piece, but the difficulties. That tenor will never be able to sing it. Doesn't understand a word of it. Never been in love in his life. I rewrite and rewrite to suit his voice. "Meistersinger" is the thing. Some money, anyway. And a household around me. - I've arranged it for piano. It might be something. - You could sell your fur coat. - He can't go to Russia without a fur coat. - Got it cheap. From a Jew in Vienna. He asked 220 thalers. I told him, I explained to him that I'd only been given 200 thalers for the concert. So therefore he knocked 20 thalers off the price. I could sell this, if only I could find a Jew in Berlin. The Grand Duke of Baden gave it to me. I asked him for a pension and a house, a modest retainer so that I might settle to "Meistersinger," and he gave me that. In Vienna they told me that "Tristan" is unperformable. "Rheingold," "Valkyrie", two acts of "Siegfried," almost. But not the music, not yet. But it's there, if only I can settle long enough. Oh, I'm so weary. I came near to doing away with myself. Maybe I shall. - Not until you've at least heard my piano arrangement of "Meistersinger." Weitzman is your Jew, he can sell anything. I shall take it to him now. At least you will have some money to get you to St Petersburg. - My dear fellow. (somber music) (crow cawing) (fire crackling) (gentle music) - Frau Kapellmeisterin, the minister is not able to see you today. Would it be convenient, might you call back tomorrow? - Illness keeps us apart. I would like to be with my husband but I cannot travel. (dramatic music) - [Richard] Well, my poor good Mutz, my Minerl, my good soul. How do you find yourself? I work and work in Russia, find myself soaked to the skin on numerous occasions, find myself enduring all the so-called joys of travel, always beset by companions wherever I can find someone to let me stand in front of an orchestra and wave a baton, a wretched baton. How does your health? Be patient and it will improve, of that I'm sure. Let me know all of your treatments in detail. I'm interested in their workings. I still suffer, but so it goes. So keep fond of me. Goodbye, good old Frau Minna. Warmest sympathy from your Richard. (dramatic music) You're afraid. - [Minna] Yes, I am. The way you would wish to change everything. Think more of your position, Richard, and less of changing everything. You hack away and hack away and you're not in a position to. You sit on the branch and hack at the tree. I'm in the tree with you. - [Richard] My worst enemy is here in my own house. - [Minna] Oh, no. Not I. He's so, so always in a turmoil. Schemes, ideas, not his business! It is his business to present music for the king. That's all and enough for anyone. Dresden is one of the foremost theaters in Germany. We are so lucky. (dramatic music) - [Richard] Kindness, I don't want kindness. I want money and I want a theater. I've plays, ideas for plays, ideas for reform. They're good, well-thought-out ideas. What happens to them? My report on the state of the Royal Orchestra. What about that? Three months to prepare, three months, not even read by the King. My ideas for a national theater of Germany. What about that? Not taken seriously. - [Minna] Well, if there isn't a Germany. - Pfordten, please, calling on the soldiers not to fight us. - Idiots. (man chattering) - [Minna] You know that nobody will be able to stage it. - [Richard] Soldiers of Saxony. Do I? - Yes. - You! - Me? - Yes, you. You mock me for my seriousness. But if one is not serious about work, what then? Desolation. There is a stage, it is out there. It is going to happen. (dramatic music) - [Andrew] Wagner did go back to Vienna, destitute again, all he had earned gone and very little coming in. But once again he found friends, sought out Jews who would advance him on security of his friends. Found another woman. Settled to his stated task of mounting "Tristan And Isolde" in Vienna. While here in Dresden we began to listen sympathetically to the pleadings of Frau Wagner, her husband employed seamstresses by the score stitching him into silk. (Richard groaning) - I was an enormous success in St Petersburg. - [Friederike] Oh, really? - This modest establishment in Vienna, my favorite city in the world, where all my friends are. But I do need that our house, your house, now my house, be kept in order, the cellars full. To this end, my present wife being unwell, unable to take care of me, perhaps I will divorce her. I ask you to marry me, Friederike. - Richard. - [Richard] Thank you. (footsteps tapping) - His Majesty has again considered the case of Herr Wagner, and in view of the great esteem that your husband is afforded throughout Germany, His Majesty is inclined to grant an amnesty so that Herr Wagner might visit you here in Dresden, in the city which was first to recognize his genius. (dramatic music) (singing in foreign language) - [Purple Dress] How dare you? - Sister? - How dare you come into the same theater as me? I? - And why not? - I have my reputation to think of. You are his mistress. I shall not rehearse while you are in the building. (dramatic music) - Herr Wagner, Master, I am unwell. My voice is in shreds. (croaking) I am not able to sing Tristan. - I'm free. I'm free, I can go back. Minna? (dramatic music) Minna? It is I, Richard. - [Minna] You have come. - [Richard] Yes. How is it here? - Pleasant, when I am well. - And you are not? - I'm better now. We have prepared a bedroom for you. Natalie. - Richard, she is very proud to have recovered your old desk here in Dresden. - [Richard] Yes. - [Natalie] She hopes you still remember it. Will you stay? - [Richard] A study. I expect you still owe everyone money. - I expect I do. You demand 3,000 marks a year from me and what do you provide in return, hm? A settled household, hm? Vienna is an opportunity. Best I've had yet. The city is welcoming, the theater is, oh, it's a chance, Minna, a chance, good chance. If I can manage to put "Tristan" on. Why, it's a simple piece, written to appeal to the public and be taken up and done everywhere. There's nothing very complicated about it. It must be very successful. Though it is, as I say, a hazard. (somber music) - The work is immoral. - All I wish from you is that you run my house for me so that I might work, nothing else. - And what do you offer in return? - I've always offered you respect and friendship. - You once offered love. - You once gave love. - I was always at your side. Your devoted wife. - You cannot attack me. - I do. I accuse you of cruelty, of infidelity and inadvertence. - All that I ask is that you provide a home for me, a settled home. - For you to come back to? - Perhaps. - You have thrown away every opportunity offered to you. A respectable life under the patronage of the court. - In Dresden. - Yes. - Where I was a liveried servant. - I was respected as Frau Kapellmeisterin. - Now you are respected as Frau Wagner. - I am Frau Wagner. - Yes, you are. You are. Well. (people laughing) (people chattering) (upbeat music) (cork popping) (people chattering) (woman gasping) (people chattering) (cork popping) (man yelping) (people chattering) (audience applauding) "In the morning I shine in rosy radiance. "Soon all is lost from blood and fragrance. "What was won quickly is soon turned sickly. (audience applauding) "Open to all was this garden of mine, "both to the beastly and to the fine. "Just bearably in this space I'll be. "Coinage, lead juice are the fruits of my fee. "From pillories the aspirant calls me. (audience laughing) "On airy paths hang I from the tree." (audience applauding) (audience laughing) Second chapter. - "Meistersinger." Hanslick, you re portrayed in it. You should feel very proud. It's not often a critic is advanced for immortality. (wheels rattling) - I've called him Beckmesser. I had thought of calling him Arselick, as in Hanslick. Ouch, that was my backsliding by (murmuring). - Is this the house of Richard? - Wagner. - Wagner? - Thank you. (audience applauding) - [Peter] A dressing gown. - Where does he find the money for it all? - He has been to every Jew in Vienna. - And this is what he does with it? - All of this? Richard, how can you afford all this? - The simple answer is, my dear Peter, that I can't. (audience laughing) - My dear Tausig, you look so unwell. - Oh, I've just agreed to stand surety for Richard. Signed as much. I have agreed to cover some of his debts. (audience laughing) - We're looking for Richard Wagner. - [Man] What are you expecting from us? - Frau Schott, Frau Schott. Frau Schott, wife to my publisher, meet Dr. Standhartner, physician to the Empress. You will have lots to talk about. Herr Schott, Herr Schott, you know Cornelius. Peter, Herr Schott refuses to advance me any more money any more. - I am not your-- - No, you are not, you are not. Peter. Peter, you are the only real friend here. Listen, we must live together, we must. (somber music) - [Peter] Live with you? Richard, you destroy your friends. Look at them. You are generous. - Yes. - Too generous. But you take everything from your friends, everything. Their money, their women, their love. Everything. - What are friends for? (servant whispering) They've set the bumbees on me. They're here to dun me. I'm ruined, what can I do? A miracle must happen, otherwise it is finished. - Then you must run. - Where? - You've had your last penny from me. - What kind of a publisher are you? You don't need a publisher. You need a rich banker or a prince with bottomless coffers. - I'll talk to them. You go, Richard, go. - Yes, yes. - [Karl] My name is Tausig. I am surety for Herr Wagner. - And who, if I may ask, is surety for you, Mr. Tausig? - Gentlemen. - Mr. Tausig. - Heavens. (dramatic music) (horse whickering) (dog barking) - Your Majesty, the strangers list from the Chief of Police. Every stranger in Munich today. - [Princess] Is he on it, Pfistermeister? - No, Your Majesty, although there are several Wagners and even one Richard. After all, it is a very common name. But this one is far too young, a mere youth of 19, a boy. - [Prince] Then if he isn't going to come to us, you'll have to go to him. - Majesty. - [Prince] I can't wait another minute. Not another day. (dog barking) (gentle music) (horses whickering) (wind howling) (somber music) (horse hooves clopping) - [Richard] 24,000 francs would be an excellent investment. I do assure you, Otto, you will be the person who gains. "The Ring" is going to be a tremendous piece. You are to be my business partner insofar as the "The Ring" is concerned. I'll throw in "Meistersinger." Soon finish that if I can get a pension and somewhere to live. - [Otto] Investment in what, Wagner? I already hold publishing rights to "The Ring". Investment in what? - [Richard] In me, in me, damn you, in me. - Ah, Herr Wagner. A gentleman has been making inquiries about you. - Name? - Not given. - Official? - Very. Come up for my luggage in 10 minutes, I'm leaving. - Sir. - Thank you, Wesendonck, but I will not take money from those who have no conception of my worth. I'm not a swindler. (dramatic music) I can't live like this, the miserable life of a town organist, like Master Bach. I must have beauty, splendor, light around me. I am not as others. I have nerves that are as sensitive as touch. The world owes me a consideration and yes, yes, luxury. Is it such a shocking request that I, who have so much enjoyment to give the world, should ask for some little comfort in return? (knuckles rapping) Come in, my luggage is ready. - [Pfistermeister] Herr Richard Wagner, musician and composer? - Yes, yes, I am he. - My card, sir. - Private secretary to the King of Bavaria? - I have that honor. Pfistermeister, sir. - A young man, just come to the throne, everything before him. He has everything he needs, he is denied nothing. - As the ruby glows in "The Ring", so the heart of His Majesty burns with desire to greet the poet of Lohengrin. His portrait. He wishes to see you at once. He desires you to accompany me to Munich. Can you be ready for the five o'clock train? - Ah. - Herr Wagner, I shall expect you. Good day, sir. - Yes. Yes. (upbeat music) - [Andrew] It was a fascinating time. Bavaria had a new young king, brought to the throne of Bavaria by the early sad death of his father. I knew him. So, high hopes, the things that were expected of young Ludwig. On the surface all was expectation and anticipation. A strong young king and a strong people. Strong enough to depose young Ludwig's grandfather when he shocked them by his liaison with a person. Shocking, a lady called Lola Montez. But Germany was still in a turmoil, not yet united, and Prussia intending to prevail by force of arms if necessary. The only state strong enough to stand in Prussia's way was Bavaria. Here in Saxony, Dresden, well, Prussia had never forgiven us for allowing our little revolution. But Bavaria, her strength lay in her people, eager to be led by their young king, looking to a new golden age, aware that politicians were jostling for power, putting themselves forward for recognition by the new young king. Aware that these politicians would seek to influence the King, perhaps towards a treaty with Prussia. (upbeat music) Perhaps towards a surrendering of Bavaria's sovereignty for the sake of a united Germany at last. Into this cauldron of politics stepped Wagner, seeing only the calm surface, not the simmerings and seethings. Seeing only his swan king, his perfect patron at last. (footsteps tapping) - Herr Wagner, we have searched for you everywhere. Vienna, we heard you were there. Russia, Paris, Switzerland, everywhere. Since "Lohengrin," as a boy, I have wished to meet you. We intend to give you everything. I have found you and I shall be true to you to the ends of time. - My debts are considerable. - Ah. - They amount to considerable sums. Considerable to me. To His Majesty they are, of course, as nothing. I had to sell my snuff box to buy my train ticket to get here. - Ah. - Do you have a note of that? My refund, of course. A house, the Briennerstrasse, fashionable but quiet, near to the King. Big enough for me and my assistant von Bulow, his wife, her children. His Majesty has offered me everything I need to perform my works. He owns me and my works. So together we shall give to the world a model. First things, a theater. We must build a theater, a real theater. - Ah. (gentle music) - This is the Grail Room, the thinking room. - Yes. - You understand? - Yes. - It is so called because, because here. - You will find sanctuary. - We will find sanctuary. (bright music) - What? - Semper is to be sent for from Zurich to make a start on the plans. I am to complete "The Ring", then an opera called "The Victors," then "Parsifal" in 1872, then in 1873 my happy death. As far as the world is concerned, I'm dead already. Work is the only thing. There shall be no distraction. Nothing the world can do can obtrude because we are under the protection of a prince. (gentle music) (birds chirping) - [Ludwig] The first time I saw it. - [Richard] Where, where did you see it? - [Ludwig] Here, in Munich. I was a boy, but I knew, when I saw it, it was what I'd always known. - [Richard] How was that? - [Ludwig] Since, oh, from the first awareness, "Lohengrin" must be about us, my family, us. - I know, I know. In Bavaria, everything comes together. The purest luck. (singing in foreign language) - [Ludwig] I intend to make up for what you have suffered in the past. Though you cannot know, you have been the sole source of my delight from my earliest boyhood. I have lived in waiting for the day that I might give you life. See here. (singing in foreign language) You who spoke to my heart as no other, you are to be simply my friend, no duties, no official appointments. - Simply, simply, Majesty, that I shall be the friend. - Every day, come to me, every day, forever. Look over here, see? Everything is known to me. I have read everything there is to read on the sagas. My imagination pictures them all. "Siegfried," "Brunnhilde," "Parsifal." But most of all, for I am he, Lohengrin the Swan Knight, we will breathe life into them all together, better than this, better. Real flesh and blood and sounds, what sounds. (dramatic music) (horse whickering) (anvil clanging) (horse whinnying) (fire crackling) First, because we are still in mourning, a few concerts. - Yes, of course, of course, whatever Your Majesty commands. - Some private studyings of "Siegfried." - Bulow. - Bulow. - Yes. - Yes, Bulow. I shall appoint him. My prime minister Pfordten shall arrange it. - Yes, 18 years ago, when you were born, Majesty-- - Friend. - Ah, friend, friend, yes. Then I had not done anything. - "Rienzi," "Dutchman." - Ah, yes, yes, but Rienzi was flawed, haunted by the ghost of Meyerbeer. - Your music makes kings. Not too many of them, I hope, in Bavaria. - There is only one king in Bavaria, only one. You will adore "Tristan." It's so simple, easy to stage. - "The Dutchman" first. - Of course, whatever you command. (singing in foreign language) (fire crackling) (people screaming) (wind roaring) (birds chirping) - I am very angry. - [Richard] You are? - Your husband, Bulow, is an old friend and pupil. Apart from the pain it will cause to Bulow, to Minna, to all of us, this amour you declare could be very dangerous. You are under the patronage of Ludwig II, King of Bavaria, and that is something quite, quite splendid. Now, you will know how wonderful life can be, la vie, perhaps yes, as it has to some extent been for me under the patronage of the Grand Duke, le duc, but there are certain obligations. - He asks nothing of me. I don't have to wear livery. I don't have to perform for him like a monkey on a stick. He asks nothing of me but friendship. - I see. Well, well, (speaking in foreign language) I must confess some-- - Envy? - Cosima is my daughter, (speaking in foreign language) Richard. Her mother and I, well. Well, if your friendship with Ludwig II, (speaking in foreign language) is-- - Is fast, safe, true. He is a god, a young god. - Surely there is something, (speaking in foreign language) to be cherished. Cosi, you must understand. Munich, is not a great and cosmopolitan city like Paris or Berlin. The people can be scandalized, shocked by a liaison such as you appear to contemplate. Surely you understand that if this happens, it will damage your standing with Ludwig, destroy everything, the great opportunity you, Wagner, are at last presented with to. And there is the religious aspect. - The what? - Yes. The spirit. - Oh, I have always been concerned with the spirit. There is much work to be done. - Yes, there is. - When Bulow is better, he will be of tremendous help. - Is he unwell? - Yes, poor fellow, his nerves are shattered, shattered. He reels from one sickness to another. I've obtained a position for him at the court. (gentle music) (birds chirping) - [Pfistermeister] It will pass, Majesty, and even if it doesn't, the King your son can hardly come to harm by consorting with a composer of operas, some of considerable merit, I am told, all of them very German. - Is he political? - There was Dresden. However, the Saxons have now seen fit to permit him to return. We are. - Yes? - Not disturbed. - Well, I am. Born a Saxon, imprisoned for debt, I hear. Ran away from his creditors, stateless. Swiss passport, probably forged. Now a Bavarian citizen. I ask you-- - Your nephew, sir, the King, is filled up with romantic intentions. He sees knights with flags trot down every lane, cross every mountain. Not, I venture to hazard, a bad thing for a new young king not yet married. The more he thinks romantic, the less he will come to harm. Youth, I value it. - [Pfordten] He is not, this Wagner, not too much artistically inclined? - [Pfistermeister] No, no, he is a person of quite ordinary tastes, except-- - [Queen Mother] Except? - Well, his work, his music. It is considered sensual, erotic. Young people are seduced by it. But there is no reason to believe that they are seduced to acts wayward. The King's mind will be filled with thoughts of swan knights, maidens aswim in the Rhine, Venus. Why not? Why not? - The sooner he gets married, the better. - Indeed. - Wagner must not be allowed to influence unduly. - At the first sign. (birds chirping) - (sighs) Very well. (gentle music) - Sire, might I present to you one of the sins of my youth? "Das Liebesverbot," one of the first by a young man of 23, never properly heard to this day. First performed, if that is the word, in Magdeburg in 1836. The tenor could remember very little of it at the time, took refuge in chunks of other, other operas. Would not have happened at all had my wife not sold her bracelet to pay the copyist. (bright dramatic music) - There, that is the ship you sailed in. - [Richard] Yes, yes, it's wonderful. But-- - What? - [Richard] May I suggest? - Of course. It must be right. - Chased out by Russian Cossacks, we were. Debts, debts. From Riga. On the run, no escape but the boat. (gentle music) The boat. And then caught in a storm. A storm so violent that it dashed against the protecting rocks, throwing up a great barrier of spray against the leaden sky. And then the calm. Peace. A great stillness. The feeling that we were lost without a resting place, like the Dutchman. Alone, time standing still. The beginning of a quest. (dramatic music) Peace, a great stillness. (dramatic music) (singing in foreign language) No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Look, if you look after the little notes, the big ones will look after themselves. So try it again now. (dramatic music) (singing in foreign language) No, no. (speaking in foreign language) Do you realize what it means? Art thou mine? It's a confession of love. Now let's have some passion in it. Now try it again. (dramatic music) (singing in foreign language) - No, no. If you just remember the words. Remember what the words mean. Forget the music for a second. Just look at the words. You must remember that the words are equally as important as the music. It is, after all, meant to be poetry. I hope it is poetry. So let us think the words and the meaning will then be perfectly obvious to the audience. We mustn't just get mellifluous like those funny Italian operas. Let's try again. (dramatic music) (singing in foreign language) - Maestro. Does this high C have to be there? It's very difficult to get. - If you can't sing the high C, we will put it lower for you. - Do we have to keep the tempo there. - You can take it a little faster and you can make it a little softer. You don't need to be fortissimo. Ignore what I've written down here. Try it again. (singing in foreign language) - [Richard] I don't know whether your voices are tired, but you're shouting now, you're not singing, you're shouting. - But it's so high, Maestro. We're almost forced to. - There's no line. - How can we sing this top C and then these things? - [Richard] If you cannot sing the top C, we will find somebody who can sing the top C, shall we. - Well, I'll think you'll find it rather difficult at this particular moment, with this coming round. - [Richard] Well, let's try it again. Let's not lose our tempers! Let's try again. - Yes. - Shall we? (dramatic music) (gentle music) - Carry on. Carry on! Right! Carry on! Carry on! Right! - [Soldier] Right turn and forwards! Carry on! Carry on! (men shouting) (dramatic music) - [Soldier] Carry on, right! (horse whickering) (singing in foreign language) (dramatic music) - Was that good right there? (singing in foreign language) - Good, good, good, good. Very good. That's it. (singing in foreign language) That's it, now, you see how it works? - It is, your Majesty, as if you were able to see your dreams, I would hope by placing of a proscenium within a very wide proscenium directing the gaze of the spectator towards the object, the illusion, a world focusing and refocusing, until one is drawn into the illusion. - Wonderful. - Every seat in the theater is the best seat. Everything can be seen. - The orchestra? - Under, under. Unseen in a great bowl under the stage. An amphitheater in the Greek fashion. Semper, can we flood it? - Well-- (Richard laughs) (horse whickering) - Herr Wagner! You must help me to protect him. - Who? - Our king. - Is he in danger? - He has a great destiny. It's written in the stars. - Really? - Wagner. Herr Wagner, you must protect him. - Mm, yes. - You do believe in the stars? - Of course, of course. - [Woman] Oh, Herr Wagner! Herr Wagner! Oh listen, Herr Wagner, why don't you listen to me? (somber music) (woman speaking faintly) - Oh, look here, somebody ought to do something about that woman, oh, look here. - Dangerous. - No, no, just silly. - Wagner is very dangerous in my opinion. - Oh, no, just ambitious. Aren't you? Aren't we all? Majesty. - It is taking so long. - Majesty? - "Tristan." Aren't you longing to hear "Tristan"? - Oh, longing, Majesty, longing (singing in foreign language) - There must be more room for the orchestra. How can we find more room? Are you not used to full-size orchestras in Munich? Remove those seats. - [Manager] Seats? - Yes, the first few rows of seats. Or do you wish us to go back to the Residenz Theatre? - [Manager] Surely, surely, Herr Bulow-- - Surely? - We would lose more than 30 seats! - Does that matter? Does it matter whether we have 30 Munich (speaking in foreign language) in the audience more or less? - There are people are waiting to see you, Richard. - [Richard] Who? - Two people, they want you to ask the king for mercy on behalf of their son who's been condemned to death. - Me? - [Cosima] What is she? - [Richard] Tell her to go away. - They've tried everyone else. - [Woman] In the matter of the king's life. - His life is dearer to me than my own. - He must be protected! - [Richard] Is he not protected? - Do you want me to tell them to go away? - There are more important things. - [Cosima] Are there indeed? - It is your duty to help this wonderful young man to fulfill his destiny. - You must understand, Frau. - I spoke to his father and his grandfather. I advised them that they would fall to the machinations of evil men and be destroyed. They would not listen to me. I can see it in the stars. You are his destiny! - Do you want to see these people? - People, no. (glass crashing) - Ah, Richard. - Richard... - Bulow, it goes well? - Yes, sir, thank you. This is Ferdinand Lasalle, who wishes you to intervene on his behalf so that he might marry the daughter of Baron. Well, sir, it is because he's Jewish. - Herr Wagner, our son is condemned to death, sir. - Can we not go elsewhere? - Franz, get rid of them. - Our son, sir. - Condemned. - I know Herr Lasalle is a friend and that he's deeply involved in this affair of the daughter of Von-- - [Mother] We wish only to keep our son alive. - We love each other, Herr Wagner. You must understand that, you of all people. - I must tell you this, sir. You are ambitious. The sort of man who does not scruple to use friends, who does not scruple to use anybody and anything for private means. - Without her I shall die. - Perhaps, perhaps. - Herr Wagner! Our king! You must help him through the morass of evil influence, false advice given by politicians interested only in self-advancement, owing allegiance only to Prussia. You are his hope! - [Father] Condemned to death, Herr Wagner. - Herr Wagner, help us to keep our son alive. - Get rid of them! Get rid of them! (dramatic music) (dog barking) - Yes, I said it. - It is not you, not you. They're beginning to howl, the dogs, consumed with jealousy for me. The musicians, those that call themselves musicians. They had nothing worthwhile in Munich until we came. They will have everything when we leave because we give instead of take. Give rather than take, that's the truth of it. What are we trying to do, huh? A school so that we might produce singers like Schnorr here, who can sing as well as act. A theater big enough, what? Nothing that is not essential, food, wine, clean and soft clothes so I do not erupt in-- - I am sorry. - I suggest that you apologize to the people of Munich. - My apology is that I have failed you. But, if you wish me to, I shall apologize to them. - You must. - Nothing must spoil what we have. All right, Isolde. - Filth and money. The artwork of the future is filth and money, Wagner! I know it. Is Bulow still here? Who gets into his wife's petticoats, eh? Bulow! Who is it who worms into your bed, eh? (glass crashing) - Excellent. Everyone else is a blockhead. Wagner is the only intelligent man I know. - Indeed, sire. - [Pfistermeister] There is the question of the bill for 1,000-- - Paul, ask Wagner to come and see me. - Majesty. - [Pfistermeister] Guilders. - What bill? - The bill for the artist commissioned. - I apologize, and I have written my apology so that it might be published. When I spoke of (speaking in foreign language) I was not referring to the cultivated Munich public. (men imitating pigs snorting) We have always shown a proper appreciation of the work of this man you are privileged to have in your midst. - Paying to have in our midst! - [Hans] Yes, paying! Why should you not? I call you (speaking in foreign language). You who scheme and plot against Wagner! You who seek to undermine his friendship with the king! - [Pfordten] Herr Wagner. - [Richard] Sir? - [Pfordten] You wait? - [Richard] The King has sent for me, sir. - [Pfordten] Not today, thank you. Your wares are not required today, Herr Wagner. - [Richard] The King wishes to see me, sir. - His Majesty will not see you. - [Richard] His Majesty sent his ADC to bring me to him. I was at rehearsal. That man, that man, is my enemy! - No, no, but, you see, the portrait-- - [Richard] The King does not like it? - Yes, but in the matter of the bill. He doesn't regard it as the action of a friend. - I beg your pardon? - No, not the action of a friend to send his Majesty a portrait and then ask his Majesty to pay for it. - But he asked me to have it painted. My boy commissioned it. - His Majesty regards this as a gift. He's very displeased that you should ask. - Even chorus girls who give to the King anything, anything, they are reimbursed, are they not? - Certainly, so. But you are no chorus girl, Herr Wagner. We must remember Lola Montez. - Must we? - She is still fresh in the memory of the people of Bavaria that little business between her and the king's grandfather, you know. - Is that any reason why I should be concerned? - Oh, yes, Herr Wagner, oh yes. You are already being spoken of as another such as she. - How disgusting. - And there are stories being circulated about your relationship with the Baronin von Bulow. - How petty. - How true? - I cannot answer. I am set back on my heels always by scurrility. I am astounded that such things should be said. The house is being bombarded, stones at the windows, why? - Herr Wagner, we love our king. We are jealous of him, he is ours. You come from nowhere, bring others with you, foreigners, Protestants, people who are not the people of Bavaria. It is a very ancient kingdom. There is a bond between monarchy and people you have been seen to come between. He, our young king, seems to prefer your company to that of others for the proper exercise of his duties. He seems to. Oh, now that is not altogether wrong, provided that you are an influence for the good. Like the beautiful Princess Sophie. How well he rides with her. Oh, do look at them. He delights in her company. The pleasure they take in each other. Altogether good, altogether proper. Tea, Herr Wagner, tea? - I must go back to the theater. - [Pfistermeister] How goes the opera? - How goes it? How is it? How goes it? If I told you, would you understand? - Perhaps not. I was simply being polite. I will now be somewhat less than polite and ask, While whilst the whole of Munich waits with bated breath for your "Tristan And Isolde" or "Siegfried," is it? Or whatever else in years to come you will slowly and laboriously and, I have no doubt, very well do, is it anywhere in your nature to be a little quicker and a little less extravagant? Sufficient comfort and food and reasonable wealth should surely be enough for any artist. Actors, singers, dancers, some of them can be very good on very little. Horses do wonders with a little kindness. - I am not a horse. - Oh, no, why should you be? But, (laughs) there are those who would have me removed. Me, your friend. Pfordten jostles, influence. If you could see your way to influence the King. After all, you have your house, money, a very snug jointure. Good heavens, anything you wish. Would you be so kind as to present certain political facts that I shall give you to his Majesty on my behalf? - Minister, what do you suggest? As if I were some paid hireling, some little actress, some kept and remunerated creature in an apartment on the Briennerstrasse waiting on visits and chocolates, legs spread, arse cushioned, whispering your requests into the ear of my royal paramour! - Herr Wagner! - I assure you, sir, I am no Lola Montez. - [Pfistermeister] Lolotte? - (sighs) There are suggestions, gossip. - Do not listen. I do not, not to gossip. - Herr Wagner's love of silk. That he corrupts the minds of the young with his music. That he wraps himself in dress lengths like a woman. - A revolutionary once, a pederast now. Such nonsense. Herr Wagner loves only himself. - Well? - If he refuses to see me, it would be all over Germany in weeks. I shall be ruined. I have said humbly, "Do I stay, shall I go? "Shall I stay? "Your will is mine." (sighs) If I go it will be to some distant land. - Some payment, please. - [Richard] I will never return to Germany. For my works I will do what I can. - It is for six cases of champagne. - [Richard] But I will sever completely the connection between the man-- - No more for Richard Wagner. Musician. - And the Glorious Youth, no. - You shall hear more of this, I'm sure. My master, Herr Wagner-- - Your master had his last bill paid by my king. It is well known. - Huh. (somber music) - "So it is for The Friend, "Friend, to decide. "One word and joyfully accept my fate." What? "My spiritual forces are at their utmost tension. "I must know by which decision, to go or to stay, "will bring peace to you, my dear one." What? The boy is an innocent. He will never understand our love. - [Cosima] Bulow looks forward to the birth of his child. - [Richard] Bulow, ah, dear Bulow. (birds chirping) - There must be no more gossip. Nothing more must reach the King. Your boy. - (laughs) How is the child? - Strong. (laughs) - [Richard] You? - Exultant. - Hm, I want to claim that child. - Bulow looks forward to the birth of his-- (knuckles rapping) - A gentleman here to see you, Herr Wagner. The name given as Dr Schauss. - Are they all gathering, vultures? (somber music) Shit, Schauss, shit! Do you all gather on the carcass? - Herr Wagner, Madam Schwabe simply requests payment of the few francs extended to you in Paris. - I know what she requests, that grotesque Jewess, I know. - Rather than send a clerk or a distraint, I came myself. Now you have come into substantial... - [Richard] I am a kept man! - But surely the king and all this and your great opera about to open. Madam Schwabe has the greatest admiration for you. She always makes-- - She charges, she charges interest! - That is consequent on your putting your name to stamped paper, Herr Wagner. - This, this, this is because, has come about simply because you've all heard I was spurned by the king! - Oh, surely not. - Spurned for a paltry few hundred guilders. Damn you, I'll pay for the portrait myself! Interest, she charges interest! This bloody woman, this bloody Jewess charges interest! - The theater alone will bankrupt the state. - If we allow it to be built. - I do not for the life of me see how it can be prevented. - Oh, we can. - We started so well. - Well? Who? - Our young king. So well. - Did he though? - Did he not? I always thought he was a regular chap. Well, at least he has all his wits. Not like his brother, Otto, wandering naked around altars. At least he does have all his wits. - Let us see if he's able to keep them. - [Pfistermeister] Yes, there is something in that. - [Advisor] Well, there is something in that, there's something. (somber music) (dogs barking) (gentle music) - [Cosima] Richard must be reconciled with the king. It must happen for his good and for the good of the world. How I hope for it soon. "Tristan And Isolde" must enter the lives of everyone. It will change them. Show them how to suffer through love, how to die in love, how to live in the natural condition of ecstatic pain. And it can only reach the stage if Ludwig gives it his full support and embraces Wagner again as a friend and genius. Our hope is that this summons to the castle at Hohenschwangau is not another cruel rejection, not another plot by our enemies who surround us here in Munich. (dramatic music) Dear Hans, devoted Hans, he works and works. Will not be taken from his task as he sees it, a simple task to show Wagner complete and perfect, down to the last dot and quaver for the first time ever love. The king must not fail to respond. He must feel it also. (dogs barking) (birds chirping) (dogs barking) - [Richard] All goes well. - [Ludwig] It will be soon. - [Richard] And now that we work together again, Majesty, it will be a work of real magic. The changing of hatred into love. "Tristan And Isolde." Huh? (fire crackling) - [Ludwig] Does von Bulow keep up his strength? His is a task. - [Richard] It is, Majesty, and he is indefatigable in his devotion. He is my second self. - Wonderful. That is devotion. - At one rehearsal, he so concentrated his energies that they drained from him on completion. He fainted clean away. - I shall reward it as I shall reward you all, you most of all. You, my friend. (baby crying) - [Ludwig] Day of rapture! Tristan! Pen, paper, Tristan! * La, la, la, la, ah * La, la * La, la, ah * La, la * La, la, (gentle music) (door thuds) - It's a girl. - Oh, Isolde. (singing in foreign language) (dramatic music) (singing in foreign language) (horse whickering) - A letter from his Majesty. (footsteps thudding) - From the King. "How I long for this evening. "'Tristan,' if only it were here. "My love for you, "I need not repeat it, will endure forever." (knuckles rapping) - There must be another letter. Who are you? - Herr Wagner, we are bailiffs come on distraint of goods and chattels by authority of the court to exercise, - And monies. - Monies. - Monies owing one Frau-- - Schwabe. - Schwabe. For which repeated requests have been made. - [Bailiff] Repeated requests have been made. - Do you realize that today is the day of the first performance of Herr Wagner's opera by command of the King? - I am by way of being a musician myself and I have every sympathy. I must say here and now before saying anything else, that your music sounds a bit difficult but maybe was worth the effort. - Our cart is arriving for such items as we feel might fit the bill. - The bill, yeah. - The bill. - [Bailiff] We have taken the liberty of taking out your excellent piano. - [Cosima] Am I allowed to leave? - Where do you go, if one might ask respectfully? - Money. You require money? - My dear lady we're bailiffs, employed to collect, you see. The law, just a law, Madam Hans. - I shall get the money. - No, no, no. It's too humiliating. No, no, no. You can't. It's all over, you can't. - Nothing in connection with you or your work affords me anything other than satisfaction. You need the money, I shall demand it. It is my duty. - Attar of roses, I believe. And 10 pounds is remaining. - Which can be arranged. You are musicians, here. This note will ensure tickets for the first performance of "Tristan And Isolde." - Thank you, sir. - It would be unthinkable to perform without a master. - Come, now, sir. Only the perpetrator of this opera is kept under restraint. The practitioners are still in situ. (Richard sighs) (dramatic music) (footsteps tapping) - Frau Wagner? Oh, oh. Then I shall not embarrass you. No. You may sign any name you will wish in receipt of-- - I shall sign my own name, Baronin von Bulow. - Wife to the famous person who's mentioned so much in the pages of the newspapers? - Am I to have the money? - You are. The King's coffers are seemingly as the wealth of the fields and hedgerows in respect to Herr Wagner. He may pluck as he will. However it must be accounted for the eventual reckoning. (accountant laughing) (dramatic music) - [Richard] Schnorr, why are you not at the theater? Malvina? - She can't. A bath. The steam. - Her voice? - Completely hoarse. - (groans) I'm fit for nothing more in this world! (piano clanging) - The performance, postponed. Just the better. All that, all that. I spoke to one brave soul who attended the private rehearsal at the special request of the king. It went on and on and on and on and not a tune in it. "One felt it would go on and on and on forever," said the poor soul. Five hours of barbaric passion. "Something simple. " - Well, I, for my part-- - You know, you know, I doubt it if we could have guaranteed protection for von Bulow. I believe it must have been postponed, I do believe for fear of von Bulow being torn to pieces by the (speaking in foreign language). - I, for my part, am sorry. The king was so looking forward to it. He will be impossible, impossible. - No, no. No, no, we can provide protection. We can... The principal singer lost her voice. She'll never sing again, I'm told. Her voice is ruined by the vile rubbish she was asked to utter. - [Pfistermeister] That innocent people should suffer! - [Advisor] The whole thing's gone too far. - Well, I, for my part, am nonetheless sorry. The king had to have his opera. The sooner, the better, surely. Simply to postpone means that we should have to go through long, tediously long, agonies of frustration. He will not settle to anything till he has had his opera. - And a new theater. - I have gone on the supposition that given the extremely boring nature of the opera work undertaken by Herr Wagner enough will very soon be enough for a high-spirited young man like our dear king. He will soon be more interested in other things, ladies, soldiers, leading his army, taking the concern of his ministers. Then we might point out what all this is costing, this monumental stone theater, this new music school and then the financing of Herr Wagner for years to come, years to come! What's more, there is this "Ring" thing. (birds chirping) - [Andrew] We heard of it even in Dresden. The delays, the scandals the difficulties of mounting Wagner's latest simple, practical opera. In any event, they moved from the old Residenz Theatre as too small not just for the orchestra, but for the storm of sound Wagner had created. All this for an opera, the score of which had been published for at least five years. Only tried once before in Vienna. Disaster, disaster. Wagner had at one time thought of writing "Tristan and Isolde" in the form of the Italian opera. But he did not. He wrote it as a single, writhing thread with not a break from its spell. Not at all simple, or practical, not at all. I looked forward to it. (dramatic music) - [Richard] To fulfill the wish of my royal patron and friend, King Ludwig II of Bavaria, I am undertaking my autobiography. The contents of these volumes will be written down by my friend, who wishes me to tell her the story of my life. As the value of this autobiography consists in its unadorned veracity, which under the circumstances is its only justification, there can be no question of publication until some time after my death. I was born at Leipzig on the 22nd of May 1830. The same year as Verdi, did you know that? No need to mention him. It was in a room on the second floor of the Red And White Lion. Two days later I was baptized at St Thomas Church. Well, I wasn't in fact, not quite, but it will do. My father Friedrich Wagner, and, to tell you the truth, he was not, but we'll say he was, died in October of the same year from the exertions of police work during the Battle of Leipzig. I do not remember it but I must have heard it. Did I? Our family was not given to outward manifestations of affection, yet the fact that I was brought up entirely among feminine surroundings must have developed the sensitive side of my nature. - [Andrew] Then, well, it happened, it happened. Disgust at the sensuous nature of the music was to come. Feeling had no place in the theater. All must be bright and light and as frivolous as possible. Poor Ludwig. His opera, you know, or so he believed. (singing in foreign language) And so it was. He drowned himself years later, murdered his doctor and drowned himself, seeking, begging, redemption. Out of death, life itself, just as in his opera. (singing in foreign language) At the first performance, I'm told, the poor king became so excited that he left before the end, aboard his train, into the night. Quite extraordinary. (singing in foreign language) (gentle music) (train whooshing) (brakes squealing) (train chugging) (audience applauding) (audience cheering) (birds chirping) (people chattering) - Richard. Schnorr is dead. - Which Schnorr? - Which? - Oh, God. Schnorr. Oh, God. He was the only tenor, the only singer, the only artist. The first singer I ever admired, the first singer with a brain. - [Cosima] They said that no tenor could ever sing Tristan. They said Tristan killed him. - He could, Schnorr could. He was triumphant, he was Tristan. I shall not permit another. Art is perhaps a crime. (somber music) - Well? - Majesty, a king must be seen by his people. They are jealous of him, they want him as their own. - My people loved me. - Indeed they did, sire. - They also destroyed me. - [Pfistermeister] Indeed they did, oh, come, now, sire. - Herr Pfeuffer, as Chief of Police, what in your opinion is the mood of the people in regard to Herr Wagner? This meddler, this one-time revolutionary. - Oh, come, now, we might all be called-- - Might we? - (laughs) Well, to be a revolutionary is often the sign of an artist. And His Majesty pardoned all revolutionaries on the occasion of the premiere of "Tristan." - Yes. - Well, there are those who dislike Wagner and his Prussian henchman Bulow because they are foreigners, what's more, they're Protestants. Second, there are those who despise the luxury that Wagner lives in. Of course, the king is using his own money. I mean, it is not as if there is profit to be made in this music. (laughs) But third, there is the time that the king gives to Herr Wagner. These are the political, military and academic classes, who may perhaps agree that art is all right in its way. Even the King's castles, if you like that sort of thing. But not today, not in this day and age. To devote oneself to music and castles in the middle of the 19th century is perhaps, perhaps, foolish of the king! The king is not a hermit. He is the leader of society. He should attend court balls. There is deep resentment among the people of Bavaria because of what they see in this young king's infatuation with this. - Well? (gentle music) (birds chirping) - Good morning, Herr Wagner. The king desires to know that you slept well. - Herr Cabinet Secretary Lutz. - A poem, written by His Majesty. - Ah, oh. "Still true to thee I stay, imperiled friend, "By deed revealed, nobility to me. "Might I but thy protector be "and end the evil trail that doth encircle thee." Ah, Majesty, your wonderful poem. I shall attempt a reply, in verse. - What of the music "Lohengrin"? - [Richard] I awoke to it. - Yes, yes. - Lutz, get out, ministers! I am giving a pageant tonight on the lake. And this, this, for you. (gentle music) May the blue of the sapphire be a symbol of our eternal faith. - He's asking for more money, don't you know? Let me say, I have a great regard for Herr Wagner. I like his feeling for the fables. For the past that is Germany. I like his feeling for the folk. But as a man, Herr Wagner does seem to leave a lot to be desired. - I'm told the man boasts he'll reconstruct the Cabinet. Boasts of his unshakeable friendship with the king. Boasts that he, Richard Wagner, has unlimited access to the privy purse. It's unthinkable, unthinkable. The effrontery of it. My God, what's all this going to cost? - [Pfistermeister] We all have our own incomes, are people of not inconsiderable worth, but. - [Advisor] We are not clerks, civil servants, lackeys, but. - Compared to my emolument. - I must however say. - Indeed. - After all the years we've served the state. - He earns more than the three of us put together. (fire crackling) (gentle music) - It is suggested that I should replace Herr Pfistermeister as your personal contact with His Majesty. You have the ear of the king. Money will be found for you. - Rid yourself of these people, Lutz, Pfistermeister, Pfordten. Be a monarch, be a prince. Surround yourself with trusted men. Seize the initiative. Use the banner I am weaving. Hold it high above the land. From Munich, go forth to lead a united Germany. Become Lohengrin. (singing in foreign language) Your Majesty. Friend. My enlightened German prince must be the leader of his people. (singing in foreign language) We too, the common people, have ancestors. And their vassalage, the oppressions and indignities they have suffered are writ reeking in letters of blood. (crowd shouting) Their blood! Our blood banner! (crowd shouting) There is something to being German altogether curious, you know. We can take a song like "Among The Meadows And Woods" and set it to music in such a manner that we all dissolve in tears. And yet when we look about us and see instead of a united Fatherland, a hotch-potch of 34 kingdoms and principalities, we are unmoved. Why? Are we little people, mere servants, ruled by and subservient to our betters? (crowd shouting) As Christ says, "If thy right hand offend thee, cut it off!" Cut it off! Cut it off! Your Fatherland is called Germany. Love it above all, and more through action than through words. Germany must have its place in the sun. - [Crowd] Wagner, Wagner, Wagner, Wagner Wagner, Wagner! (fire crackling) (anvil clanging) (fire crackling) (horse whickering) (anvil clanging) (fire crackling) (crowd shouting) - Your Majesty, this is quite simply a fearful and decisive moment. We must arm ourselves against Bismarck. Prussia is at the gates. War is imminent. You must decide between the love of your people and your friendship with this man called Wagner, this man who is despised by the Bavarian people, by every section of the community, no matter what their standing. They despise him for his ingratitude and shamelessness with which he openly exploits the undeserved favor of your Majesty. This person called Wagner must be got rid of at once. (dramatic music) - [Ludwig] No! Wagner! Wagner! No, no! (metal clanging) (dramatic music) Wagner! No, no! No! Wagner! - His Majesty commands that I hand you this. His Majesty commands that you leave Munich forthwith. His Majesty commands-- - May I have time to pack? - His Majesty commands! - His Majesty commands! Bastard, the lot of you, Jews, sodomites! Hebrews, Hebrew Jews, sodomites! Arseholes, the whole pack of you are filth. Filth, that's why you have snouts, so you can find where the truffles are! You swine, no-good swine. - Control yourself, man! - That's why you're a swine! - [Advisor] I am here in an official capacity! - You're swine. - Control yourself, man! I am here in an official capacity. - Pigs, swine, ah, get out! (dramatic music) (train chugging) (horse whinnying) - [Andrew] Poor Wagner, thrown out now from Munich, this time without even Minna to comfort him. Minna, Minna, who had always been at his side. (gentle music) - [Minna] Oh, chased by Cossacks again. (wheels rattling) - [Richard] I remember, I remember, chased from Riga, the clumsy conveyance upset near a farmyard, and you were so severely hurt by the accident. - [Minna] After this, I could have no children, remember? - No. - [Andrew] I don't have the facts of it, and of course she always loyally denied it, but the truth is, when he was being kept by the king, by Ludwig, I'm afraid he, Wagner, kept her very short of money. - Just not true, it is not! - [Andrew] And I do regret to say it, he did not even go to her when she died. - I could not. I did not. (train chugging) (wind whistling) - [Guide] We are to take a historic trip on the lake of Lucerne. We will see the place where Switzerland was founded 600 years ago, that you can be sure, under the Seelisberg. It is set up to be historic, by subscription, I shall take special care to point it out to you. (bright music) Do you see the Rigi yet? A mountain, you may see it, yes. And for the moment, look back at the historic community of Lucerne. - Lovely. - Do you see it, Lucerne? Do you all have tickets? (upbeat music) Do you all know the legends of Switzerland? Would you like me to tell you the legend of Arnold von Winkelried, a very famous Swiss soldier who truly did something very brave? (laughs) He truly did. Do you know the story? In 1386, a long time ago, he threw himself on the long lances of the Austrians. Do we have any Austrians on the boat? I am sorry, he died. But we won. And there is Triebschen, where the famous German composer, Herr Richard Wagner, is living with his friend the Baronin von Bulow, and her children. (laughs) (singing in foreign language) Madame Hans is a daughter of the famous Hungarian composer and virtuoso Franz Liszt. Hans von Bulow is Kapellmeister to the court of Bavaria. Ludwig II of Bavaria is patron to Herr Wagner, for whom Herr Wagner wrote all his operas (laughs) which include "Tristan And Isolde" which some would consider to be quite shocking. - Was. - I beg your pardon? - Was the Kapellmeister. Our king sent him packing. - I presume you talk of Bulow? I hear he resigned for ill health. - That's right, packing. - Herr Wagner is quite simply the greatest living artist that Germany, indeed the world, possesses. - [Passenger] That's right he is and he's very loud, so loud he cannot be heard. His music, it blows your head off so no one can hear it. And he wears clothes that women wear, for which, and other things, Ludwig sent Herr Loud And Silky Wagner packing too. With all his friends, packing, all of them. Let the Swiss have them. (laughs) (singing in foreign language) (ship horn tooting) (knuckles rapping) (door rattling) (birds chirping) - Your Majesty, Frau von Bulow. - I cannot believe that we have not met. - Your gracious Majesty, in our hearts we have. - Your husband can stay with me. I need him with me so that I shall never lose sight of our work. - Frau von Bulow is very helpful to me, is unselfish. She has left her husband for a few days, has brought her children here to live with me in exile. Is my muse, my secretary, in which role she excels. - She does, she does, of that I'm sure. Now, Meistersinger. How near, how near, wonderful. I've all the time in the world. I have come to live with you, work with you. Regard me as your copyist. Set me to, Master, set me to. - [Richard] It is very near. Would you like to hear? (dramatic music) (door clicking) - Newspapers, newspapers. - Here, this. Sit down, my dear fellow, sit down. - An official denial has been given to that lie. Unfortunately, it is the truth. I have an official report here confirming that the king left Schlossberg with Prince Paul early on the morning of the 22nd. Yes, and was seen boarding a train, incognito. - Incognito! - A beard. He was in Lucerne by the morning with Herr Wagner. - Will he come back, do you think? - Parliament cannot open without him. - The question of the mobilization of our army against the Prussian threat cannot be debated. How can His Majesty be so headstrong? He is expected to place himself at the head of his troops. - Under an umbrella? - [Pfistermeister] Is it raining? - Will he come back? - We will know if he does. - What? - Come back. I shall be the first to know. I have men on every road, every station. - [Advisor] Do they know what he looks like? - Oh, yes. We'll know. - Excellent. (laughs) (dramatic music) * La, da, da, da, la, la, la * La, da, da, la, la, la, la * La, la, la, la, la, la * La, la, la, la, la, la, * La, la, la, la, la * La, la, la, la * La, la, la, la, la, la (singing in foreign language) (gentle music) * La, da, da, la (singing in foreign language) * La (singing in foreign language) (gentle music) (girl crying) (singing in foreign language) (gentle music) (birds chirping) Dear one. If it is your wish and will, I gladly renounce my throne, its empty splendor. I shall come to you, be with you, forever. - No, you must bear all. All. For the good of your people. - Well, so much for Meistersinger. How goes the great enterprise? How goes my "Ring," our greatest adventure? - Well, well. - When? When? - Would Your Majesty hear some? - Please. (speaking in foreign language) - How long does His Majesty intend to stay? - Forever. - No, no, we must get him back. - Prince Paul explains that the king has fled Munich. They are waiting for his command to mobilize the army. - Prussia will attack before we can get our army in the field. - He talks of living here. - [Ludwig] Exalted one! (Richard groans) (dramatic music) - If His Majesty did come to live with us, how would he live? - Live? - Money? - Money. Some lands but not a great deal. - Enough? - For the needs of His Majesty, yes. But for his plans in regard to Herr Wagner, certainly not enough. - Then he cannot abdicate. - No, for the sake of Bavaria he must not. - Quite. (speaking in foreign language) (gentle music) - If he abdicates, who will reign? - Who? His brother, Prince Otto, I imagine. - Otto? Didn't he throw himself on some altar, raving, stark-bollock-dangling-naked, and raving? (sighs) Bavarians are true Germans. The people of Bavaria unite the versatility of Franconia with the imagination of Swabia and the native strength of Bavaria. I see in Bavaria, under your enlightened rule, a release of the ideal of the German spirit. - I love no woman, no parents, no brother, no people, no one fervently and from the depths of my heart as I love you. - I will never return to Munich. - How can I govern if we are forced to remain apart? You, our work, give me everything. - Majesty, if you, friend, the friend, if you will not listen to the argument that you are the leader of your people, their only hope in the face of the chaos of democracy, as well as the ignorant might of Prussia and the thick-skulled persuasion of Bismarck, if you will not, then let me try to persuade you with the argument that without you, there would have been no Tristan, there will be no "Meistersinger," no "Siegfried," no "Ring of the Nibelungen," "Parsifal." All the work that I do, have done, with you, will do. Is all this to be wasted? Lead your people, be a king. Dismiss the twittering Nibelungs, Pfistermeister, Pfordten, Pfee, Pfi. Only a king can realize our plans on the magnificent scale we envisage. A German king. - Yes. I? I. Yes, only I. (somber music) (shutters squeaking) (birds chirping) Paul, fetch me my helmet and my sword. (both sighing) - I thank God. - How dare you? - Herr von Bulow, is it not the truth? - It certainly is not. - So sure? - What was said about my wife is more to the point. It's a scandalous attack on my very name and honor. - Yes, yes, your wife, yes. - It says that Wagner is in Lucerne. - [Editor] Does it? - That your wife, the carrier pigeon, Baronin von Bulow, daughter to Liszt, is with Wagner, where they were recently visited by a certain exalted person. - Here it says, "The musician Wagner, her friend or what?" - Or what? - An apology sir, an apology. - Do you wish me to say what everyone knows? That she got away with 40,000 gulden for her friend? - My seconds will call on you, sir. - (laughing) Herr von Bulow! You are a Prussian, are you not? Then I would advise you to leave the country rather than fight duels. What do you suggest, glissandos at 30 paces? No, (laughs) no, Herr Wandwaver. There will soon be enough fighting going on bloodily between Bavarians and Prussians on the field of glory, sir, the field of glory. - If you will not believe me with regard to the honor of my wife, perhaps you will believe your king. (dramatic music) (artillery booming) (horses neighing) - [Soldier] Halt! (men shouting) (gunfire popping) (horses neighing) (wagons clattering) (people chattering) - Attention! (horses neighing) (dramatic music) (men shouting) - [Soldier] Fire! (artillery booming) (horse neighing) (men moaning) - [Soldier] Ready to go again soon, sir. (men groaning) - [Soldier] God bless Your Majesty. - [Soldier] We'll be ready to go again soon, sir. - [Soldier] Well done, sir, well done. - [Soldier] We tried to do it well, sir. - [Soldier] God bless you, sir. - [Soldier] Well done, sir. - I'm ready. - Well done, sir. - [Soldier] I'm ready, sir. - [Soldier] God bless Your Majesty. (somber music) (artillery booming) (men screaming) (man gasping) (wagon rattling) (birds chirping) (bright upbeat music) (door thudding) - Ah, Hans! (laughing) - Oh. Ah, yes, I am very impressed with Bismarck. The poor king. Do you think, because of the war, he will abdicate, do you think? - Oh, this is shocking. - Hm. Is Bismarck the man to lead Germany to greatness? - Oh, this is shocking. - I called on the editor and demanded an apology. - Thank you. - Something must be done. - Yes, the king, my friend, must be asked to write you a letter, Bulow, in which he states that you are vitally important to the artistic life of Munich, and that he's shocked by the scurrilous treatment accorded to you and your blameless wife in the newspapers. How will that do? Which letter being received, you may publish it for all to see. The king's letter giving the lie to all this, this filth and innuendo. Some of "Meistersinger." (sighs) - Will the king do such a thing? - If I ask him to, yes. Look at this. (gentle music) (birds chirping) - But it is not lies. - I need the king and I need Bulow. Listen to him, he has only seen that piece for the last hour or so and already he has it on the piano. - It could be a difficult letter to write. - No, no. - Is it the honorable thing to do? - It is necessary. Bulow works himself to death for me. He should not have to face such ridicule in the newspapers. - Is it not dishonest? The truth is I am your mistress. I have given birth to your children. I am, I am. Everybody knows this. - The king does not. - No. Nothing matters but you, that which is in you. You are the cause we serve, all of us. - Thank you, you're right. There are those of us, artists and strong men in other ways, who must for our own ease, so that we may do that which we have to do with conviction and strength, must be unwaveringly supported, never questioned, set above all other persons, given everything. All is clear if one understands that. There is nothing dishonest or dishonorable about it. What shall you write? - I will... I'll think about it. (birds chirping) - Ah, Bismarck, what? Poor Ludwig, soundly trounced by the Prussians. I always said it would come through Prussia. If the Prussian king had accepted the crown of emperor and leadership of Germany as a whole, we would not have needed to fight him in Dresden. What, Bulow? Bulow. You are not looking well. You look exhausted. Is "Meistersinger" going to be too much for you? Is there somebody who can help you? I'll get somebody. (somber music) - I've written it. - Ah, what have you said? - You may wish to read it and you may wish to add to it. - No, no, no, read it to us. - "Royal Lord, I have children, "and it is my duty to hand down to them "their father's honorable name unstained. " - [Richard] Yes. - (sighs) "For the sake of them, these children, "that they may never cast aspersions on my love, "which love you share for our friend." - [Richard] Let me read it. - Bulow, free me. - You are free. - Divorce. As soon as the king knows, he must know one day, promise me my freedom. - Oh no, our religion and your father. - Hans. For Wagner. You love him as I do. He wants a son. You must help him to have a son he can own as his. My father, I'll go to Rome, I'll talk to him, I'll renounce my religion. - You must not, I beg of you. Consider it deeply. Please. The friendship of Wagner and Liszt is a great one, which must last. - See here what I have appended? "She is the faithful wife to Hans von Bulow, "the father of her children." (gentle music) "My royal Lord, my friend. "For the first and last time, "I implore you to act for us. "I fall on my knees before my king, "and in humility and distress, "beg for the letter to my husband "that we may not leave in shame and ignominy "the country in which we have desired, "perhaps, dare I say, have done nothing but good." - Summoned? - Why? - I fear I shall be dismissed. - We are to be blamed? - We advised the war against Prussia. - Did you? - Did you not? - Look at Lutz, our war minister. Leapt from his horse, banged his head against a door. - [Richard] "My dear exalted friend. "If you make this public statement, then all is well. "You who came into our lives like a divine apparition. "Oh, do not consent that we, the innocent, "shall be hunted out. "Your royal word alone can restore our honor "which has been attacked." Good, very good, very, very good. That should do it. - Have you read that disgraceful letter that Wagner's published from the king? - Well, the king is really an innocent. I'm just beginning to realize it. He inquired of me, "What is done when rape is done?" The other day. (laughs) Innocent. - Hm. - My dear Bulow. The sound of cowbells. (laughs) Cowbells. My dear Bulow. Cowbells, cowbells? (dramatic music) (singing in foreign language) (audience applauding) - [Crowd] Bravo, bravo! Your Majesty, if you allow-- - What do you say now that I have stilled the malicious lies about Wagner and Baronin von Bulow? What do you say after this triumph? What do you say to the return of Wagner to Munich? - Why not? Why not? - I consider Richard Wagner the most evil man under the sun. A man who would ruin your young majesty in body and soul. And turn your subjects so strongly against you that you would be unable to rule. I'm told Schopenhauer has a great influence over Herr Wagner. I'm not surprised. I'm told Schopenhauer denies the state any moral function, any function at all, except that of the protection of the lives and property of such as Herr Wagner. With which to serve your majesty until death. I'll only do so if I am committed to make the moral judgment that such as Wagner is not seen to enjoy Your Majesty's love, on pain of Your Majesty losing your throne. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (wheels clattering) - How, Frau von Bulow, do you imagine I'm going to do without Herr von Bulow in Munich? - Please do not shout at me. - You have driven him from me. You are jealous of my love for him, is that it? - If you loved him, you would have seen that he is very, very tired. He needs rest. - From me? - He's worked at your side all these years. If you saw him now, you would think he had one year to live. - [Richard] He is longing for "The Ring." He longs for it. - He must leave Munich if he wishes to. - You must go and persuade him. Persuade him to stay on as Kapellmeister, to do the work of Wagner in Munich. - I shall not see him again until he divorces me. - I don't care about divorce. It is nothing to do with divorce. It is to do with work, woman, work. Don't you understand the importance of that? - How can you say that to me? (Wagner growling) (dramatic music) Eva, Eva, Eva. What am I to do without him, Frau Bulow? - Have you given thought to using Hans Richter? - Yes, we'll send for him, yes. - Thank you, Herr Wagner. You may now move. - Ow! - [Cosima] Come on there, Birdie, let's go find Bonnie. Let's go find Bonnie. - Oh. - [Cosima] Go find Rusk. - Oh, no. - Yes. - See if it's the fellow I knew in Leipzig. (dramatic music) (birds chirping) - Herr Nietzsche? Herr Nietzsche? Have you done it? - I did, indeed. - [Man] Miss Morgan? Herr Nietzsche. - Ask Herr Nietzsche to stay for supper. - [Nietzsche] I cannot bring myself to consume meat. - [Richard] Then you deny yourself strength. - How? - [Richard] You're a carnivore, you need meat. - No, I tell you the truth. I've sworn an oath that I will only eat vegetables. - Rabbit. - No, it's important on moral grounds. - Arrogant rabbit, Cosi, have you ever met an arrogant rabbit? Here he is. Have you ever met a professor of philology who is an arrogant rabbit? - Frau von Bulow may not have, but I have, many of them. - You need good nourishment in this climate. You need good red meat. We are here, you and I, to provide a means of escape from the futility of life. You regard life as futile? - Of course, you know that. - Schopenhauer. Eat not other people, nor mutilate them, for that is the great wrong. It denies them their individuality. Therefore eat animals and produce a temporary respite from the futility of life and the slavery of the will, for which you will need your strength. I do, but I cannot do it on milk. - Hm. Siegfried could not forge his sword on milk. - Mm, no. And Richter here could not work as he does without the food we give him. I'm feeding him up to stamp on the heads of the Nibelungs. Go forth, Hans Richter, into Munich, and slay the (speaking in foreign language) with "Rheingold." He likes pig meat as well. Don't you, Richter? - Well, I-- - After "Tristan And Isolde" in Leipzig, the overture, remember? I heard it for the first time. I wanted not food nor drink. - Ah. Ah. (dramatic music) (woman moaning) - The experience, yes, Schopenhauer. But the physical strength we acquire when we train our bodies helps to harden ourselves against anything else they might fling at us. What does he say against unhappiness? Danger? Loss? Injustice? (dramatic music) Let me read you from my student days at Leipzig. I write my life. Frau von Bulow is dictated to whenever "Rheingold" and "Siegfried" leave me time. A few pages of it might amuse you. Would you care to hear? - Yes, please. - I managed to find time in those days to finish quite a substantial lot of composition. Richter, this will amuse you. "How I went about it. "Different Coloured inks "to bring out the mystic meaning in the orchestra. "Black ink for the brass, red ink for the strings, "green for the wind. "But I was not able to get red or green ink." (men laughing) (dramatic music) The maiden theme of the overture was contained in four bars. But after every fourth, I added a fifth which had nothing to do with the melody at all which I expected to be announced by a bang on the kettle drum. (Richter laughing) You see? (dramatic music) See? The fatal kettle-drum beat, brutally hammered out, deprived one of my senses. Then the audience began to count one, two, three, bang! One, two, three, bang! One, two, three, bang! (dramatic music) (singing in foreign language) (Cosima screaming) Bang, one, two, three, bang! One, two, three, bang! One, two, three, bang! One, two, three-- - Herr Wagner, Herr Wagner. - Bang. - You have a son. - Siegfried. Victory in peace. (Nietzsche laughing) (gentle music) (baby crying) (gentle music) (baby cooing) - Well, you. Yes, yes. (triumphant music) - [Andrew] This child, held high, shown the world. Shown to the world. This child Siegfried at last born. For Germany. A German sword. A leader of stout, German, Aryan stock. A sword in his eyes. He will be the beginning of a new age, will carry the flame and the sword and the lights, through struggle. Nothing without struggle. Attack and defense. Suffering and struggle, victory and defeat. Domination and servitude, all sealed with blood, will lead us on the quest that is Wagner's quest to help us all cross the sacred river, will show us that it is our quest as well. The quest for the grail. And for truth. What truth? What truth? What truth? What truth? (somber music) (water lapping) (birds squawking) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (baby crying) - Siegfried. - Now our real child is born. (speaking in foreign language) - Baby, sweet baby. Lovely child. (baby crying) Our child. (dramatic music) - [Andrew] We were, I was very much afraid, going to find ourselves at war again. Bismarck of Prussia to fight France. He was set on it. France equally determined to fight Bismarck. It was only a question of when. And because Bavaria had lost her last war against Prussia, as we did, we were all going to have to fight alongside Bismarck, and like it. I didn't, Ludwig didn't like it. But an excuse was to be found to bring about one Germany at last. All the states under one Kaiser and under Prussia, of course. Wagner's hopes for a united, strong Germany realized. The events which had to some extent started in Dresden were at last to come to fruition for Wagner, through war. Wotan rides, but first Lohengrin had to be persuaded, though he had little choice, little choice. (dramatic music) - What you must do (sighs) the designs are not what I wish but that can be put right. What is important is that we control the entire production without interference. Now that Pfordten's been dismissed, we must seize our chance. And you, young master Richter, you must be in a position of complete power, able to grab them by their pizzles and twist some sense into them. You will obey my instructions to the letter. Now, the character Loge, yes, you must tell Schlosser. Is it Schlosser who is to portray him? You must tell him that he is to avoid being comic. It could so easily become comic. This won't do. His hair must be flames, red flames. So at last it begins. (gentle music) (footsteps tapping) - Wonderful, they look wonderful. Where is everybody? - Switzerland. Everybody is in Switzerland, Majesty. (dramatic cacophonous music) * Rheingold * Rheingold * Rheingold (singing in foreign language) (baby crying) - Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! (singing in foreign language) (instruments squeaking) (woman whimpering) - Tune those B flats, horns. * Da, da, da, da, da Fs, Fs, tune the Fs. * Da, da Can't you read the notes? There are few enough of them, for God's sake. * Da, da, da, ah (women screeching) * Da, da, da, da, da * Da, da, da, da Louder, louder, I can't hear. * Ya, da, da, da * Ya, da, da, da, da, da * Ya, da, da, da, da That's better.

Gloves and white neck cloth cost money. - [Cosima] What do you intend? - Well, you re still my wife, it's quite simple. I see you, I want to be able to see you. Always. - I do not wish to see you ever again, until after we are divorced. - [Hans] Wagner seduces everyone. You, me, our children next. - [Cosima] Bulow, that is evil, that is shocking. You owe everything to him, as I do. - I have-- - You owe everything to Wagner. - There's no small ability myself. - [Cosima] Do you love him? - I do. I do. - You were given the opportunity to be the finest, the greatest exponent of Wagner. - I am. Or at least I have been. - I ask you because Wagner will never ask you himself. - No, of course he won't. I shall not divorce you. - [Richter] "Rheingold" cannot be ready. - The king insists. - Never mind the King. - Never mind the King? You forget yourself, young man. If we do not mind the king, we are in danger of not minding anything any more for we will be elsewhere then in Munich. - His Majesty expects the world premiere of this opera "Rheingold" tomorrow. You, sir-- - I will not. - I am tired of being harangued by an absent composer. - His Majesty will expect to see a performance on such and such a day. Whatever day that happens to be. - September the 5th, I obey only Wagner. - The money that has been poured into this undertaking. Singers traveling more than 200 miles to exercise their tonsils. And not only this. What kind of an opera is this? - Herr Minister, this is the kind of opera that makes young women seasick. The stage is flooded with water. There is no interval. Giants, a dwarf, and a possible rainbow. But most of all, the kind of opera it is, nobody's given a chance to sing properly. - (gasps) I resign! - Herr Richter. You are suspended. - I shall see "Rheingold" on the 5th September. It belongs to me. I have paid for it. Wagner is being impudent. I want to see "Rheingold." I have waited too long. He sends me a telegram saying that it must be postponed. I have every right, in view of the fact that I own the whole work, to see it when I wish to see it. - Majesty, your command. However, I have been forced to suspend Richter. He was insufferable. - Find someone else! - [Ludwig] They tried Lassen in Weimar, Herbeck in Vienna, Levi in Karlsruhe and Saint-Saens in Paris. - [Richard] Bulow? - [Ludwig] Yes, none of them accepted. Possibly the chorus master, Herr Wullner. - [Richard] Tell him to take his filthy hands off my score. Let him conduct glee clubs or one of Perfall's operas, but not mine. No chorus master will conduct anything of mine. Who is he, this chorus master? Some Jew, many times passed over? What? I will hold a full piano rehearsal with scenery, lighting. Ah, he who is to portray Wotan. - Thank God you are come, Richard. They call me a spy because I write to you, you, the genius who has done so much. - No, no, no, no, no, Herr Wagner, you are not permitted to enter the theater. - Sir. - Wait here. I shall speak to the king. - Sir, the king is not in Munich. (Richard screaming) (dramatic music) - [Cosima] My dear Hans. I learn from Richter that now you have submitted your resignation from the court theater in Munich, you intend to leave Germany, and that you wish me to give my views about the fate of our children and the disposal of our property? If you are leaving Munich because you feel incapable any longer of enduring the intrigues and unpleasantness by which you are surrounded and overwhelmed, permit me to say you are wrong. Your character's well-known. There's nobody who does not respect you, and everything which causes an indignant outcry will be directed against me. In the first place, I am a woman who is expected to uphold the moral order. In the second place, I am a mother and I appear to be sacrificing my own children. And in the third place, you are a man of honor whom I married of my own free will. Whatever my good intentions, I have never made you happy. I do not believe that you can scoff at these feelings. And it is in their name that I ask you whether you have the strength to separate from me officially to allow me to bring up our children and to remain in contact with me. Of course, the world and your family are within their rights in advising you not to leave the bringing up of our children to me, for they claim the right to see me simply as a woman who has broken her sacred vows to indulge her passion. (dramatic music) - Well, he can rave about "Rheingold," how good it was. Of course it wasn't. How could it be? How could it be? As for "Valkyrie", well, we'll see. But he won't have "Siegfried" because I haven't finished "Siegfried." Have I? Have I, Fidi? It will remain very carefully unfinished. Until I get my own theater in which to perform the whole of the "Ring" in the way I think it should be performed. - You should go to Munich to see what they've done with "Rheingold." - No, did you see it? - No, I refused to go out of respect for your feelings. Perhaps you should. - No, I will never go to Munich again. The king would not see me. The theater was closed to me, never again. Ludwig owns me, owns me and my works, but I shall never condone his action by going to see my work travestied. - That is good news. - Ah, Judith. The light in your eyes. Look at Fidi, his eyes. Somebody said of him that he has a sword in his eyes. (somber music) (bright music) (baby crying) The French. - Push me. - Look at them. The Jew, Mendes, famous critic, likes my work. Must be mad. Brought his friend Villiers, another mad Frenchman. As for his wife, daughter of Gautier, another critic, look at her. How would you like to go bird's nesting in that girl's garden? Huh? (laughing) I shall. - Richard, what are you doing? - Climbing, climbing. (people chattering) You French must do something to expiate your crimes. - [Villiers] Crimes? - The crimes of France, Nietzsche? - Nobody will deny that France has given the world a great deal, ah. - Is it criminal for France to defend herself, monsieur? - Yes, Monsieur Villiers, it is a great crime to resist the civilizing influence of the German peoples. Whatever the arguments between France and Bismarck over who should be placed on the throne of Spain or wherever, there reality is that there is a struggle between the French and the Germans over who should lead Europe. A war will solve the problem. And I hope it will also lead to a united Germany at last. I believe that this is the first intention of Bismarck. In this noble aim, France has a part to play. You must be defeated, and soundly. And indeed you will be. For the French character in comparison with the German is appallingly narrow, filled with false poetry, false logic, misplaced eloquence. You have forgotten how to be Frenchmen, a once noble race akin to the German race. Brothers, searchers of the grail. You have become Parisians, kept women. Streetwalkers, whores. (laughs) Paris, (speaking in foreign language) of the world. Paris, oh, I see I have shocked you. We confess, that when we knew you were coming, we thought it might be unpleasant to have you, even though you are friends, because of the behavior of your country in declaring war. But I determined to try and help you understand. Sit you down, feed you, dash some cold water on you, in the hope that some French at least will come to their senses. What does the Herr Professor have to say on that? - I'm frightened. - N, no. - I'm frightened that we might not win. Very frightened. But it is only through a new, united Germany that I can see any hope for the world. We must break our intellectual subservience to France, break it once and for all. We must win. I regret I have become a Swiss citizen. I cannot fight myself. Would I could rejoin my regiment. - But you were wounded the last time. - I sustained a chest injury while mounting my horse. But I have made inquiries and the only way I can involve myself is by way of the ambulance service. This I shall do. - How noble. I wish I could do the same. - Oh, no, Cosima, that would never do. You'd be shot as a spy. She has the regrettable habit of crying out in her sleep. In French. (all laughing) - Might I remind you of something you said some years ago? You said something to the effect that in longing for German grandeur, the German can usually dream of nothing other than a kind of revival of the Holy Roman Empire. Such an idea filling even the most good-natured German with an unmistakable appetite for mastery, and a craving for supremacy over other people. Good night, Herr Wagner, Frau von Bulow. - Typical Frenchman. (Cosima laughing) (somber music) - Gentlemen, is there any more to be said? - No, Majesty. No. - Hohenlohe, is there no way of avoiding war with France? - [Hohenlohe] No, I've been to Berlin. The King of Prussia and Bismarck are determined on it. - [Pfistermeister] I fear so. - This time with France. - [Pfistermeister] Yes. - [Hohenlohe] At least this time there's a good chance of being on the winning side. - Is there? - (sighs) The ordinary people of Bavaria would rather have a century of France than a year of Prussia. - Our treaty which brought about the end of our disagreements with Prussia means that we are expected to fight with Prussia. However, I am trying very hard to actually avoid doing so. I shall do it in French, hmm? (speaking in foreign language) (artillery booming) (somber music) - [Soldier] There's a French body over here! - [Cosima] The little professor is gone to war. - [Richard] Who? - [Cosima] Nietzsche, gone to war. - [Siegfried] I should go. I should volunteer. - [Richard] No, you're an artist. The duty of military service rests with the ordinary person, especially those that are German, indeed, also those who are not. The Jews, certainly, a race that accepts all from Germany but rarely contributes. All Jews would profit from service in the German army. They would thus gain a German attitude and be the better for it. - [Loldi] Are the Jews not Germans? - [Richard] No, Loldi, no, they're not. They are the Nibelungen, Nibelungen. Ah, I shall suggest that Bismarck brings back the beating of women just as soon as he's beaten the French, what? With words, my words. (somber music) (artillery booming) - [Nietzsche] Is there going to be anything coming from this frightful misery? Do I want greatness to come from this? Must I not only bear this but love it? Wagner, are you not perhaps looking at things too simply? No, of course you're not. I write to you this. For the first time, I feel it. The strongest and noblest will to life does not reside in our puny struggle to exist but in the will to power. Yes. The will to power. (gentle music) (man whistling) (singing in foreign language) ("Wedding March") - [Cosima] So, I shall write and say in my diary for Thursday August the 25th, 1870. Mm, how shall I put it? This day at eight o'clock, we were married. Richard Wagner and I. Oh, may I be worthy of bearing that name? A very ordinary German name. But simply the most glorious German name. (dramatic music) Bismarck has done it. What a christening present for Fidi. (singing in foreign language) The local newspaper prints pictures of French soldiers. And from them all, the wretchedness and degeneracy of the people stare out at me. In those bestial, besotted faces, one sees complete idiocy. Soon be Christmas, the winter upon us. Richard will want to perform as the great German hero Santa Claus. (singing in foreign language) Yesterday, Richard read to me from his biography. And the shameless conduct of his wife Minna towards him made me shudder. When we returned from our walk, we found an Italian in the courtyard. His countenance moved me to pity. The whole eclipse of a nation was reflected in it like a dream. This race is likable, but I doubt whether it is still capable of active deeds. Garibaldi is an old fool. There, that is what I shall write. (gentle music) About this day, plainly and dully, I will tell you what happened. As I awoke, my ear caught a sound which swelled ever fuller and fuller. No longer could I imagine myself to be dreaming. Music was sounding. And what music! When it died away, Richard came in with the five children and presented me with the score of the "Symphonic Birthday Greeting." "Now let me die," I exclaimed to Richard. He replied, "It would be easier to die for me "than to live for me." (dog barking) - [Richard] For you, happy birthday. A symphonic birthday greeting. Bismarck. The hero of the future. - And what will he do, this hero? Rise up booted and spurred over the bodies of his neighbors? Perhaps. Philosophers are out of place in war. - [Nietzsche] Philosophers! They plunged us into the dark ages, the shits, made us speculate on existence instead of getting on existing, and taking the only path apart from immolation that could possibly alleviate the suffering of existence. I refer, of course, to art. - Do you see the Greeks, after their golden revels, ever having very sore heads? - It's we who have had the sore heads, 2,000 years of sore heads, brought about by philosophers. And I include among them the hedge-priests, and God chanters and brisket beaters who taught us to despise ourselves, made self-disgust the highest virtue given to man, kicked our pride in the arse and left us nothing, came between our pure, primitive and artistic yearnings and our hearts, produced half-men. We shall make man whole again. Through art. Do you tell that to your students? (dramatic music) (anvil clanging) - Then money must be found! This castle will be built! I command it! - Your Majesty, it's other matters I would wish to press. - Don't talk to me about other matters! - They are important. There comes a time when messages cannot be passed from groom to king. - Groom? This is not a groom, this is my friend. I had another friend, a great friend. They drove him away. - I hear he has other friends now. - Other friends? (laughs) - He makes approaches to the kaiser. He is suggesting a festival to be dedicated to the peaceful conclusion of the war and asks for a subsidy from the kaiser, suggesting a new theater, his theater, in which to stage the festival. - His theater? It will be our theater, ours together. I am his king and his friend, the only person who understands him. Go away! Go away! (dramatic music) (people chattering) - I can't hold the book, my fingers are freezing. - Here, let me, let me. "Let no one believe that the German spirit has forever lost "its mystical home when it can still understand "so plainly the voices of the birds that tell of that home." (dramatic music) Listen, Nietzsche, listen. - [Nietzsche] I don't need to, Wagner. I wrote it. - [Richard] You wrote it for me. - [Nietzsche] What are you, Wagner? - [Richard] Listen, "Some day it will find itself awake "in all the morning freshness, "destroy vicious dwarfs, wake Brunnhilde, "and even Wotan's spear will not stop its course." - [Nietzsche] I wrote that before the war. - But it is even more true now, and inspiring. - [Nietzsche] Is it? Is it? Is it? - [Richard] Any theater, Nietzsche, any theater will do, what? Now which is the biggest theater? Which opera house has the biggest stage in Germany? - [Nietzsche] Heavens, how would I know? - [Richard] Come on, we'll find out. (bright music) Cosima? - [Cosima] What is it? - Cosima, look at this. - My Christmas present to you. A manuscript. It's to be published. Please, give me your views. - [Richard] It is wonderful. It is everything we believe to be true. - Are you fully recovered? - I think so. - It was a glorious thing you did. It must have been such a privilege. To see a real German army take the field, how it must have inspired you. - I don't think discipline in war, courage in battle, the actions of heroes and leaders, unity, obedience, duty, has anything to do with culture. - Do you not? - [Richard] Cosima, which opera house has the largest stage in Germany? - I'm not sure. Bayreuth has the deepest stage. - Bayreuth? I seem to remember. Now where is it? I've been there. Come, you re a soldier. You. - Me? - Yes, where is it? - All right, Franconia? - Franconia, yes. - Here. - Ah, Berlin here. - A small town, Protestant. - Yes, Berlin. With Pfistermeister replaced by Lutz, who knows what that will bring? Yes, Bayreuth, halfway between Berlin and Munich. Halfway between Bismarck and the king, ideal. (gentle music) - [Cosima] Wonderful. - Rococo, it won't do. Can you see "The Ring" with all its primeval splendor being done here? This is a Mozart house. - I fear so. - You will go elsewhere? - No, no, no, my dear fellow. You don't get rid of us as easily as that, does he? - Oh, no, Bayreuth has been decided on. - May I on behalf of the whole? Madame Wagner, may I, Madame Wagner, may I, on behalf of the whole? - [Cosima] Well, we will just have to build something of our own. - Ah. - We can't build anywhere else, not now. My wife has decided on it. This house has failed us. I shall not burn it down. I shall simply tower over it. - Herr Wagner, the people of Germany have always loved you. May I on behalf of the? - [Richard] Because I write pretty tunes? - No, because you have helped us find our destiny. May I, on behalf of the whole? (sneezes) This is where the king comes, where he stays when he comes to Bayreuth. - When does he come to Bayreuth? - Well, not just yet, but should he come. Herr Wagner, may I, on behalf of the whole? - Well, he will now. - Yes. - [Cosima] We're looking for a house. - We're looking for a hill on which to build a theater. - [Cosima] We can't find a house. - Must it be on a hill? - Of course. - We'll have to build a house. - When we've built the theater. - While we're building it. - Mm-hmm. - Subscribers. I can conduct everywhere. I can always make money conducting. What we need is 1,000 subscribers at 1,000 marks each. Then we don't need the king. He can go on building his castles and his follies. - Yes, well, there is a hill, just outside the town with nothing on it. Herr Wagner, may I, on behalf of the whole? (groans) Oh. (dramatic music) - And so, on this auspicious day, to be remembered until the ends of recorded time on this glorious occasion, amid so many loyal friends and with the blessing of your mayor, I chose Bayreuth because it has no real standing theater of its own. Though Berlin wished me to build there, Baden-Baden offered me a site, here in Bavaria in the center of Germany, near enough part of the kingdom of my beloved patron King Ludwig II, who has (groans) who has sent us this message, his seal, his own words, delivered to me to be placed within the foundation stone. - [Ludwig] What did I say to him, my friend? From the depths of my soul, I sent him my warmest and sincerest congratulations on this day that is so significant for all Germany. He is building. So am I. Which of us will show the truth? Which of our creations will be the greater? (dramatic music) Come and live with me in my world, our world, which I have created for you. Be blessed, my stone. Long may you stand and hold firm. That is what I wrote to him. Long may all my stones stand. Do you hear them, the stones singing of the glories of the past that was Germany? Gone, long ago, but living in my stones. Let our blessing and good fortune attend our great undertaking. Seal it in your stone, my friend. (man groans) (man laughs) - [Nietzsche] At last! - [Richard] What? - [Nietzsche] At last, this, coming together. - [Richard] What? - [Nietzsche] Well, it will come together, it has. Yes, I'm convinced, after all the work. - [Richard] Money. - What? Oh, yes. - There isn't any. There just isn't enough to build a theater. We must have money to put something on. There will be one performance, only one, that's all. You, what are you doing? - What? - You, you, all of you? - Well, the Wagner societies are really busy-- - Wagner society, they're not getting the money, not enough. And do you know, some of them have the damned cheek to demand expenses? - [Nietzsche] Even so, this is something. - What? - This. - Ah! (bright music) - [Andrew] "We are come looking for singers," said Wagner, "to every opera house in Germany, or so it seems." The length and breadth of the country, they traveled, their ears assaulted by the most appalling noises, their imaginations never engaged beyond the initial bars, hearing music dragged or rushed. At every fresh place they hoped, hoped to find just one actor, one singer, not too far gone down the path of vulgarity to be of use. (singing in foreign language) And all for his wonderful new theater at Bayreuth. (dramatic music) - Herr Wagner, water! - I see that. - Struck water. - I intend to fill my house with water and fire, anyway. - [Andrew] We all did our best to help set up Wagner societies, devoted to the raising of money for Bayreuth. Every German city had one. In Dresden, we had two. Banquets were given and the money trickled in slowly. - [Nietzsche] And I should like to propose a toast to all those, including the king, who subscribe to the building of our theater, your theater, and to all those other dilettantes who have formed Wagner societies throughout the world, including America. (laughing) (triumphant music) - [Cosima] In England, we went to Windsor to see the queen. A small woman, Richard said, and not very pretty. She stated she had heard of Herr Wagner. (laughs) And wished him every success with his fundraising. Windsor, so dark and damp, and such hideous pictures. Some 20 concerts were planned in London at the Royal Albert Hall. But in the event, only eight were given. And he concerts themselves were dreadful. The queen asked how we found the music in England. Richard found it difficult not to answer that he was still looking for it. - Perhaps the theory is all. - [Richard] What? - [Nietzsche] I said-- - I know what you said. I don't theorize, Professor. You're not a musician. - No, no. Do you write to the king? - I am coming to think that I know this world less and less. I do believe that for all their banquets and compliments, I am soundly hated by the whole of Germany. - Does the king answer your letters? - What? What are you doing here, you? - I came to see you. To see this. - Piano compositions. - Ah, yes, I hope you feel you can-- - Piano compositions. You write piano pieces. Look, look, look at this, look. (dramatic music) - [Nietzsche] I hoped you would find my piano composition had some merit. - [Richard] Bayreuth. Everything must relate to Bayreuth and what we are trying to do here. Piano pieces do not. And what was that piece by Brahms left on the piano? You insult me with Brahms. Jews, Jews, Jews! They write vileness about me. They must be attacked. You must all attack them, all my friends, all those who are faithful to me. There are proofs to be read, articles to be written, work to be done. Nietzsche, what do you do? Piano pieces! - [Ludwig] I need no messages in my stones. I speak, I sing, I create my own poetry here. This is how it was. This is where the Meistersingers sang, our Meistersingers. Ours, I am the Swan Knight. Born to be another Wartburg. (singing in foreign language) (people screaming) (fire crackling) (anvil clanging) - Good, good. - Thank you. - I'm thinking of changing the title. What do you say? - [Copyist] Say? - "Twilight Of The Gods" is all right if you know what twilight means in this context. But if the meaning isn't clear, the title is hardly precise enough. "Judgment Of The Gods" might be better. - [Copyist] What? (bright music) (singing in foreign language) - Rocks, rocks, anyone can paint rocks. You don't have to squint at it. For goodness sake, hurry up. (horns blaring) (singing in foreign language) - Soft, soft. * Ah, ah This is the Rhine, not a steam engine. (gentle music) Softer, gentlemen, softer, please. Terrible! Long phrases. No rests! Softer, horns, softer! Three, figure three! Keep up with me, you re getting close. And... Back, back, back! * Ah, da, ah, da God knows where we are. - Are there still holes in the ceiling? - The building supervisor is doing what he can, but heavens! There's worse than that. There's no hope of fitting all the musicians into that orchestra pit. None. - Tune that top E flat, that's right, tune it. Gentlemen, gentlemen, (murmuring). - [Violinist] Herr Richter, my violin strings have broken again. It's too hot down here. Yesterday the violin itself cracked. - [Richter] Well, then, get it repaired. - It's almost impossible to find anyone to repair a violin. It will have to go to Munich. - Yes, yes, this town! Everything costs twice as much as it did. Everything. And this pit. It's like the engine room of a ship. - Young Master Richter, are you ready to get off your arse and do some work? - Yes, Master. - Morning, boys, morning. - Only 702 subscriptions! - Morning. - I have done my best. - Yes, Herr Feustal, yes, you have. 5,200 marks, enough to keep us running for two days. (dramatic music) (singing in foreign language) - [Manager] No, I can't get up enough steam for the bridge to work the rainbow. - [Richard] Why? - The simple fact is, Herr Wagner, we can't afford it. I am told to save on vapors. They are considered expensive. - Never mind, never mind. We must do something about the glare from the orchestra pit during the "Prelude to Rheingold." The effect is being entirely ruined. - Apparently, your musicians need to see. - What, to play in an E flat and a B flat? Two notes, mad, mad. (dramatic music) - Well, it worked in Munich. - Did it? - We had one or two difficulties. Had to change the base. The problem is the singers. Not exactly sylph-like, are they? - Then I'll try it. (singing in foreign language) - Frau Wagner, was it not agreed there should be no free seats? Not even for rehearsals. - Yes, of course. The Master wrote to every patron, and every friend, explaining that there was not to be any free seats, ever. - The entire Bayreuth Fire Brigade! Every man! Admitted by Herr Wagner, gratis, free. I give up. - [Cosima] Shh! (singing in foreign language) - For you and the children. - Master. - What now, Brandt? - An instrument to replace the orchestra. (accordion wailing) - Richter, Richter, come and see this! It may mean the end of the world. (somber music) If "The Ring" coincides with Germany's victories, something. - I'm not staying. - You must. Cosima, he's not staying, he leaves us. - [Cosima] Why will you not? - I have admired you both, devoted my thoughts to you both. - [Cosima] Not me, it is none of it me. - I am sick, of that there's no doubt. I have the most dreadful headaches. I really must take a cure somewhere. Oh, all these people, Wagner! All these Germans who flock to Bayreuth! The clubs, the societies, decked in ribbons, blowing trumpets, slashing at each other with sabers, spouting their anti-Semitic rubbish. You. You have the nerve to write that Christ was not a Jew, do you not? Do you care? To imagine you could herd all the Jews into a theater of your choosing and then burn it to the ground. As if that would solve the world problem. Whatever you think the world problem is. Not to mention a cellar full of silk, in boxes. A house fit for a king, paid for by a king. Children who treat you like a god, your tomb built already, waiting to receive your body. That picture. The Holy Family. Claptrap, mumbo-jumbo and claptrap! Not you, your music will still rise above the posturing, but this is all play-acting. You're a small-time theater manager who by some strange trick of fate has been given the biggest, brightest, most glittering, over-decorated barn to call a theater ever seen, and it is all to you! Opera is all, there's nothing else of value to you. The whole of Germany must flock to you. In your estimation, they fought their wars simply so that you might tug on a curtain and shout, "See the face of art!" as according to Wagner. And what we sometimes call the Almighty, those of us who should know better. The Cross, the Grail, the Search! "Suicide, the purest form of birth." Claptrap! Silk-clad dances of glee at the rare show you have persuaded a poor deranged royal romantic to buy all the tickets for and pay for the tambourines into the bargain. I have things to do. I have hopes and aims beyond Bayreuth. You have come into your own. You know what it is the people want, your so-called German people. You know what this age brought about by war and the yearnings for power is in the market for. You throw it all together. Music, war, death, ecstasy, torment, bangs and crashes, floods and conflagrations, exquisite neuroses, obsessions. Sensual and profane hand-in-hand with vulgar coarse twitchings of sexual fantasy. And potent, real grandeur. Dangerous, elevating and plunging and convincing stirrings in such a soup will feed criminals as well as genius. You're dangerous. You're a dangerous man, Wagner. You talk of gods but you know there is no god but Wagner. (scoffs) Yet you have the power to convince fools they might become gods. Not you, not you. Know that I know you. At last. That which you create, I would not want to answer for its effect on a nation sniffing at power. (Nietzsche coughs) (door thuds) (somber music) - [Richard] Well, tomorrow. (people chattering) (somber music) (set scraping) (people chattering) (horse neighing) (train chugging) (bell clanging) Majesty. You came, you came. At last. (birds chirping) From here you can see it. - [Ludwig] Yes. - [Richard] It has taken five years, more. We laid the foundation stone in May of 1872. It poured with rain, I told you. Last week, the rain was still coming through the roof. - All I've ever wanted, our dream? - Real. - Your house? - Built. The money you sent. And for the theater, most kind. - Everything ready. (horse whickering) (set scraping) - Until the last minute, the very last minute, it was nearly impossible to show you anything. We are letting you see it first in private, as you wished. I hope the resonances won't be too much for you. It will be very loud. After your Majesty has seen his own performance, we will have the gala opening and let the kaiser in with the others. (laughing) (dramatic music) (singing in foreign language) (anvil clanging) (fire whooshing) (anvils clanging) (fire whooshing) (singing in foreign language) (crowd cheering) (dramatic music) (crowd cheering) (fire whooshing) 30 years ago, that, that, sent his soldiers to Dresden to crush us. That prince who is now a kaiser. - That dragon, absurd! - [Ludwig] Photographs, photographs. Herr Wagner. - Majesty. - How future generations will envy us. Those of us who have had the incomparable happiness of being with you, now at this moment. Long after we both have ceased to be, our work will remain. - You, Majesty, my co-creator. You. (gentle music) (birds squawking) - [Franz] It has become difficult. - [Richard] It has become impossible. "Parsifal," yes. "Parsifal." - [Franz] You had the nerve to suggest that Levi was baptized. - [Richard] What? - Levi, the rabbi's son, the conductor of "Parsifal." - [Richard] What about him? - Baptized. - [Richard] About time. - No, no, no. You wanted him baptized before he could conduct "Parsifal." - (laughs) He was very upset. He should have understood. The things, the things. I conducted the last performance myself. - [Franz] Yes, so you said. There's always Bayreuth. - It still totters from day to day, from month to month. Still no money. "The Ring" performed in '76. Complete financial disaster. You know, we had to sell everything to pay for it. Lighting, machinery, costumes. Then "Parsifal," the last, the last. Well, they liked that. And it was good, very good. And the money rolled in and I thought, at last some rest. But no, always dries up, always. Concertizing all over Europe, just to try and keep a roof on the building. (sighs) Bayreuth is in danger of never opening again. Money, I even thought of giving up and going to America. - Do you want me to play it for you? - What? - Very well, if you don't wish me to. - Do you remember Siena? In Siena, that's where, Siena, the cathedral. That Russian, Joukowsky. The painter. (dramatic music) (door clicking) I stole that from you, Liszt. - [Franz] What, what bit? - That bit. - Then there was that Miss Pringle, English girl. A flower maiden. (laughs) Well, at least she was until you. - Ah, Miss Carrie Pringle. - Do you want me to play it for you? - What? God has been my strength. (gentle music) - [Richard] Cosi worried about vulgarity, that such a work as "Parsifal" should not be sullied by vulgarity. She tells everyone now that we wanted no applause. I wanted applause. I have always wanted applause. I was thunderstruck when we did not get it. Thunderstruck, hmm? He should have been baptized. Levi, you should have been baptized. I finished with Bismarck when he actually gave German Jews equal citizenship with the rest of us. I had three Jews working on "Parsifal." All hard workers. Gifted even. (sighs) Levi led me a dance. We still are friends. He has not abandoned me. Ah, the desertion of friends. The list is so long. Cornelius, Ritter. He was a booby but he could still be useful, still do something. Took Joukowsky there. Took him to Ravello in the south, the magic garden. Have you seen it? Have I shown it to you? Joukowsky knew what I wanted, what, huh. I have shown everyone so much, given people such inspiration. Whoever accuses me of insincerity must answer for it to God, but whoever accuses me of arrogance is a fool. (laughing) Tausig. Do you remember Tausig, in Vienna? My surety? Surety. Now, there's a Jew who was tormented by his origins, tormented to death. Minna, dead. Nietzsche came to see me in Sorrento. I thought him still worth talking to, told him of "Parsifal," the great Christian legend, expounded on it for him. All friendship dead there, too bound up in his wretched headaches and vomits, blind as a bat. I wrote to his physician to tell him to curb his masturbating. Nietzsche masturbates, you know. I told him, persuade his patient to stop masturbating, eat vegetables and take cold-water plunges. Now they're all gone, all my so-called friends who would support me to the ends of life. Minna. Ludwig. (sleigh bells ringing) (dramatic music) - I consider it the beginning. "Parsifal," a success. It will be done everywhere. - "Parsifal" will never be done anywhere but in Bayreuth. It must be kept for Bayreuth. Bayreuth, a madman's whim. And the weather! - Do you want me to play it for you? - What? (door clicking) Your father, the old humbug. - [Cosima] Humbug? - Yes, humbug. The life he has led and now he fancies himself a priest. The old lecher. Wants to play me his latest "Ave Maria." Get rid of him! I can't stand it any more. - Please, wasn't it you who said he inaugurated the new age? - Yes, in fingering. (gentle music) (door thudding) (water lapping) (dramatic music) - [Crowd] Wagner, Wagner, Wagner! Wagner, Wagner, Wagner! Wagner, Wagner, Wagner! Wagner, Wagner, Wagner! Wagner, Wagner, Wagner! Wagner, Wagner, Wagner! Wagner, Wagner, Wagner! Wagner, Wagner, Wagner! Wagner, Wagner, Wagner! Wagner, Wagner, Wagner! Wagner, Wagner, Wagner! Wagner, Wagner, Wagner! Wagner, Wagner, Wagner! (crowd cheering) (somber music) (bell tolling) (dramatic music) (water splashing) (bright music) - Ludwig must go. Ludwig must go. (gentle music) (door clicking) (door thudding) - That bitch is here. - Bitch? - That English flower maiden. Pringle. Says she can't live without you. Beseeches you. Hypocrite. Lecher. English flower maiden? - Minna. My watch. (singing in foreign language) - [Andrew] Three years later, King Ludwig walked into the lake, arms up, drowning, seeking redemption, died. (dramatic music) Cosima held the dead body of Wagner for 25 hours, so I'm told but herself lived on for another 47 years. While the theater, the temple, on a hill outside Bayreuth, like that other hill outside that other city, (wood creaking) so long ago. A temporary structure, still temporary, still there. And Wagner? Well. (singing in foreign language)
