Hey, Cameron. I'm heading home. See you in the morning. I just wanna check in with Melissa before I head home. Hm. See you tomorrow. See ya. Cameron! I just wanted to check in and see if you need anything else before I head home. Thank you. You're the best. I'm OK. I'll lock up here. I could... wait around for a bit. Maybe we could grab a bite at that new Mexican place next door. I'm good. I just wanna focus on this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, OK. I'll, um, see you in the morning. See you. Gimme everything you've got! Cash, keys, phone! Help me! Cash, keys, phone. Help me! You'll pay for that! I don't think so, dude! 911. What's your emergency? You were very lucky that, uh... Kevin. Yes, uh, Kevin showed up when he did. Please just promise me you'll be extra careful walking through here at night, OK? And please call me if you have any questions. Thank you. Bono: You two have a good night. Well, I can't thank you enough. I don't even wanna imagine what might have happened if you hadn't shown up. I'm just glad I was here to help. How can I ever thank you? Maybe you might join me for a glass of wine or a meal sometime? I know this was a really intense way to meet, but... Well, I... Look, no pressure. Why don't I just give you my phone number and then you can call me after you've had time to think about it? Sure. Why not? OK. Is the coast clear? Yeah. It's all there. Nice doing business. Grace! Come on! What? Where have you been? You're gonna be late for your first day, really, seriously? Move it! Lay off, Mom! I've got plenty of time. It's fine. I am so tired... of your... Every single time. Sweetie! I'm home! Didn't you hear me calling out? Uh, sorry. Just my mind's preoccupied. You're home early. Yeah. I thought we could cook dinner together like we used to. I miss how we'd do that, talk about our day. I do too. Really, I do. I've just had a lot on my mind lately, you know? Did you get much work done today? Heard anything about the wine bar proposal plan being completed? Everything's coming along with the wine bar, babe. Don't worry. Trust me. I got this under control. Yeah, well, I've heard that before, Kevin Well, this time's different. Trust me, OK? I don't wanna argue, Kevin. All we do is argue lately. I miss how things used to be. OK. Look. Why don't I open a bottle of that new white burgundy that you brought home and we can cook ourselves something special with the groceries I bought. Just gonna grab a shower, OK? Hello? Look, I told you I was good for it. I just need a little more time. You'll get your money. It's not gonna be a problem. Hello? Are you there? Dammit! I just told you I... Oh, hi, Loni. Um, tonight? Uh, OK. Just, just gimme an hour. Where are you going? So sorry, babe. Work called. Clark's out tonight and they want me to fill in. But I just made dinner. Well, weren't you the one that told me I need to make the most of this job cause of who the chef is? Well, yeah. I just, I... Don't wait up. I probably have to help with inventory tonight too. Melissa! Oh, hi, Lauren. How are you? I just want to say I'm sorry for that whole scene earlier today. I mean, Grace is, she's all grown up, but I swear I don't think my mothering's ever gonna end where she's concerned. No worries. You have a good night. Oh, and I am grateful and all for what Kevin did for Grace. What are you talking about? Well, he put in a good word for her at the new tapas restaurant. Now she's a hostess there. So you're saying Kevin got your daughter Grace a job where he works? Yeah. He didn't tell you? Uh, no. Happy he could help. You have a good night. G'night. Here. Smell this red. See if you can tell me what aromas you can identify. Is uh, that a bit of cherry I smell? Very good. How do you know all this? I worked at my uncle's restaurant after college, and he trained me to be a sommelier. A sommelier's an expert of wine. I'm even certified. Oh! Maybe you'd give me a private lesson sometime. For you, that could be arranged. Hey, um, between us, I'm really close to opening my own wine bar. And, uh, maybe you could come work for me. Really? Yeah. I would love to help you in any way that I can! Grace, we have guests who need to be seated. Sorry, Loni. Quinn! What a nice surprise! Is it? Yeah, of course! I haven't seen you since... Vegas, two years ago. Do you have a few minutes to talk? In private? I don't think you wanna do this here. Follow me out back. I don't have much time. I need to get back to work. How refreshing to see you actually working. How'd you find me? Well, I had to do quite a bit of digging with the help of a PI and a tech nerd, but it was all worth it just to see the look on your face in there. I see you didn't take long to find your next mark after me, a successful fashion designer no less. And you even charmed your way into a marriage. Wow! Why can't we say what happened between us is just water under the bridge? Hm. Because you swindled me out of a hundred thousand dollars for your wine bar that never happened and then skipped town on me! Some businesses don't work out. What do you want from me? My money, all of it. Yeah. I don't have that kind of cash. Oh, but I'm sure your wife must. I'm pretty sure you can use your, uh, masculine wiles to, um, convince her to give you cash. And if I don't? I have some proof of your, uh, illegal activities. Yeah. You wouldn't like jail. You have seventy-two hours to figure it out. And don't worry. I'll text you my number. OK. Have fun... babe. All right. It's stunning. Thank you. Oh, I was stuck on the design for so long, but it finally came together. This could be our biggest season yet, the collection that really takes us to the next level. Well, fingers and toes crossed. I could not have done it without the support of you and Cameron. Well, what can I say? We are the dream team! I wholeheartedly agree. Kevin? Again? Things haven't gotten any better, have they? No, they haven't. I think back to that first night when he swooped in and rescued me. Yeah, he did make quite a first impression that night, for sure. But, since... Oh, honey, uh, I'm so sorry. I just... You deserve so much more than how Kevin's treating you. Thank you. You said he started a new job in the meantime, right? Yes, another new job, which is good because he spends money faster than I can make it. Could you make sure this goes out in the mail, Mary Ann? Sure thing! Um, do you have a moment to talk? Hey there! Well, hey there back! I had no idea that you hiked along this route too! You sure you weren't just following me? Wanna finish the trail together? Let's go. As a friend, I'm concerned. Melissa has been so distracted lately. And she's even made a mistake on a couple of orders and she never does that! I'm just... I'm worried that the great momentum we've been building for the company is gonna take a hit if it continues. It's Kevin, isn't it? He keeps her on edge sometimes. I will never understand what she sees in that lousy... You have feelings for her, don't you, Cameron? Am I that apparent? Maybe, just a little. I should head back in. I'll be back up in a minute. Um-hm. Hey! Hi. Guess what? What? An old friend of mine just called, said he might be interested in investing. Just waiting on that proposal to send him. Consultant said he might need a couple more weeks to make sure everything's well-polished. And it's gonna cost a bit more, too. How much? Five thousand. I just need a little more help from you, OK? Kevin... I thought you'd be pleased. Aren't the more investors I can get, the better? I am. It's just... look, I'm happy for you. I just... Why don't you sound like it? You're my wife. It's gonna be a late one for me so, uh, just go ahead, go to bed without me, OK? Hey, you OK? Yeah. Just, uh... Need to clear my head. Just a little bump in the road setting up my wine bar. Well, you're such a smart guy. It'll come together. You really think so? Mm-hm. Yeah, I do. I could just listen to you talk about wines all night. It's kinda sexy. Think so, huh? So, how you like working here? Uh, it's good. Yeah? I'm not sure Loni likes me yet though but... Oh, yeah, yeah. She can be a tough nut to crack. Just smile and nod and do whatever she tells you. You're beautiful, you know that? I'm really glad we're getting to spend this extra time together. Me, too. Uh, Kevin... You're so amazing. I've had a crush on you since you moved next door. You should really invest in a better alarm system. I wouldn't scream if I were you... Melissa. Hm? Who are you and how do you know my name? I... work with your husband's business associates. And what does that mean exactly? Let's just say my bosses help facilitate wagers for clients when it comes to, uh, sports teams and the like. So you're a bookie? Oh... I hate that term. You still haven't told me what you're doing in my house. Hm. Your husband recently placed a $30,000 bet on... well, what he thought was a sure thing. Now, he has paid me fifteen thousand of it, but he keeps making unfortunate excuses as to why he cannot pay the rest. Hm. And then there's the issue of the other money he owes. How much? Three hundred... thousand. Ah, you, you seem like a nice lady, but either your husband or you will pay what is owed. I hope we're clear on this. Great apple by the way. That was amazing, beautiful. You were... incredible. But, um... what about Melissa? Yeah. She doesn't get me or what I need. It's been that way for a while now. We have to keep this between ourselves, OK? For now. Hi! Hi. Why aren't you in bed? Someone who knows you paid me a little visit earlier. Who? He said he was a business associate of yours. OK. I, I don't know what he told you... A bookie, Kevin? What in God's name were you thinking? It's not a big deal. Not a big deal? He threatened me. He told me you owe him three hundred thousand! Is this true? He said you already gave him fifteen thousand. Is that the same money that I gave you for the wine bar business proposal? Wow. We will somehow sort the rest of this out in the morning. In the meantime, I need a break. What do you mean "a break?" I mean don't even think about coming into the bedroom tonight. Smart move not trying to dodge me anymore. Just how many people you owe money, my friend? Look, I told you not to worry. I got this. Why'd you go scare my wife like that? Now everything's more complicated than it needs to be! I told you I would get what you owe my associates one way or another. If I have to go through your wife to get the money, so be it. I've got a plan to get a big chunk of the money by selling some pricey artwork I've got. I just need the time to work it out. Your wife is a successful businesswoman. Surely, you can do better than that. I'll get my share. You can bet on that. Call on line three for you. She said she was with one of the boutiques. This is Melissa. Melissa, it's about your husband. Meet me downstairs outside in front of the building. I think you need to hear this. I'm just gonna run a quick errand. Sure. That was amazing. Yeah. But I gotta get ready for work. Leave these for me? You're a naughty boy! Ah, you have no idea, babe. Ah! You have no idea. Who are you? Do you work for my husband's bookie? Bookie? Oh, yeah. Probably someone else he's in debt to. Your husband owes me money, big time. Look, I don't know what to tell you. That's on him. Listen... OK. I feel bad about this. I really do. I used to be you. What do you mean? Can we sit down for a second? Please? My name is Quinn. I was one of Kevin's marks before you. He practically cleaned me out. What do you mean before me? A couple of years ago in Vegas, I met him when he saved me one night from a mugger. I had a successful interior design firm in Nevada. He had been studying me for weeks before we met after he read an interview, I did in a local paper. And I fell for it. Look, I know what it's like to have him sweep you off your feet, both in and out of the bedroom. But he ruined my entire life and then just disappeared. And he'll do that to you, too. What do you want from me though? I honestly debated speaking to you about this at all, but I just figured I should warn you. I have proof of some of his illegal dealings and he's worked with some shady people. Well, that part I do know. Probably not to the extent I do. Look, I need my money. OK? He owes me a hundred thousand dollars. I deserve to start over after all of this. Well, I can tell you right now he does not have it. No! Absolutely not. I am no longer going to be Kevin's personal ATM machine. Let the chips fall where they may with this mess that he has gotten himself into. Look, I really appreciate you coming to me, confirming some things for me. For what it's worth, I am sorry for what he's done to you... to both of us. I doubt we're the only ones. Melissa? Yes? Just be careful ridding yourself of him. It can, it can get dangerous. Unfortunately, I'm starting to realize that. Where have you been? Just went for a night hike. I felt this burst of energy earlier. Can you pour me a glass, too, babe? Of course. It's been a day. Thanks, babe. My pleasure. Not mine! What the hell? You crazy? After being married to you, it's a wonder I'm not! In our bedroom? So? It's not like you've been up to doing your wifely duties lately. My wifely duties? You're illegal gambling, you're cheating, not to mention I met your friend Quinn today. She says you owe her money. Well, she's just... She told me that she met you the same way I did, that you studied her life before you met, that, uh, she was your mark. So you were only interested in my money, is that right? This whole marriage has been a sham? You played me just like you did her. Who knows who else? Well, sounds like this Quinn woman might just bring you down. Yeah. I'm not worried about that. This, um, relationship, this marriage, whatever you wanna call it... It's over. Really? You think you can get rid of me that easily? I'm warning you, Melissa. Do not underestimate me. I will get what I'm due. It's better if you just give me what I need to pay these people off, or else things could get dangerous for you. I'm only gonna say this once so you better listen carefully I want you gone by the time I leave for my meetings in Harrisburg tomorrow morning! The rest of this mess will be sorted out later. I don't wanna look at you for another minute. By the way, I have cancelled our joint credit cards. This is far from over. Why aren't you packed? What do you mean? I told you to get out of my house by this morning. Ah! Well, need I remind you that this is our house? Don't test me! I'm heading out for my hike now. Bye. Kevin! Kevin! Kevin! We're not done hashing this out! Kevin: Hey, don't worry. I'll be back soon! While I'm gone, why don't you think about how much you'd be willing to spend to really get rid of me? Oh! Yeah, I just remembered! You have to go to Harrisburg for your special meetings, don't you? Looks like I'm gonna have the house all to myself. Well, when you come home, maybe you'll have calmed down enough to realize the reality of the situation: that I'm not going anywhere until I get what I deserve. What you deserve? Are you being serious right now? Need I remind you that I paid for this house? I'm the one who says who stays and who goes! And I'm your husband and I've got every right to be here. You lost your rights after doing what you did! The lies, the cheating, the gambling, All of it! I have reached my limit with you, Kevin! To my detriment, all that I've tried to do is be supportive of you through this marriage, if you could even call it that! Hi. I would like to report a domestic disturbance next door. Oh, look! Your work husband's here to save you, I guess. Melissa, are you OK? I would be better if he would leave. I've asked him to leave... and he hasn't done it yet. This is our marriage home, Melissa! I'm not going anywhere. Our marriage home? Don't make me laugh! Laugh? So our marriage is a joke to you? Don't flip this on me! Till death do us part, babe! Isn't that what we promised each other? You couldn't keep a promise if you tried to. Melissa told you to get out. So you should do that, now. Chill, dude. No need to put on a show for Melissa. I am leaving, to go for a hike. I'll be back later, OK? Cameron, don't! Cameron! Well, that was humiliating. I finally convinced the police that no one was going to get murdered today. Well, at least Kevin is gone for now. He's cheating on me. Oh, God. Melissa, I am so sorry. I've been trying to make this marriage work for so long that I've purposefully overlooked so many things. Now I'm paying the price. You know, he's insisting that he won't leave, even though I'm the one who purchased and paid for this house. Not him. He had no part in it. My first marriage, already headed for divorce. Look, I have a friend, Erin, who is a divorce lawyer, and she owes me a favor. If you like, I can give her a call and see how soon she can see you... if that is what you want. It is. I am so done with this. Oh, God! We have the three-hour drive to Harrisburg to make the cocktail meeting with the governor's wife. And then the breakfast meeting's tomorrow. Do you wanna cancel? No. I'm not gonna cancel on such an important client. You, you are so strong, tough, Melissa. You, you'll be OK; I'll be right by your side the whole time. Let's go. OK, Erin. Thanks so much. Talk soon. She can squeeze you in tomorrow. Thank you for setting up the appointment and for driving us to Harrisburg. I uh, really appreciate the support. Yeah, no problem. Yeah, the sooner I get the ball rolling on this, the better. This piece is very interesting. It's worth over fifteen thousand dollars actually. Are you being serious? Very. Are you sure Melissa's not gonna come back at any moment? Positive. She's out of town. Which means... we don't have to rush. Why do you want me to leave already? I just don't wanna take any chances. But you, uh, you told me that we don't have to rush. Yeah, but you never know. Melissa's plans might have changed. See you tomorrow? You bet. Grace? You're still up? I tried phoning you on your cell earlier, and when you never answered, I got worried and called the restaurant. Seriously? I'm an adult, Mom! And we both know you haven't always acted like one. I've got the frown lines to prove it. Your boss told me the place was closed tonight because of plumbing issues. Where have you been? Why the third degree? Are you sleeping with him? What are you talking... Our neighbour? With the guy you keep going on and on about how wonderful he is? With the man who had an argument in the front yard with his wife this morning who screamed out he'd been cheating on her? I'm going to bed! Are you sleeping with another married man? I don't have to listen to any of this! Quinn! Look, I don't have exactly have what you need but I will soon. Meet me at Le Garnier Restaurant at nine o'clock. It's at Third and Main. Quinn! Kevin! I thought we were meeting at the restaurant. Changed my mind. Thought here would be better. OK. It's gonna take me some time to get the money, but I will. I'm divorcing Melissa and she's not getting rid of me without a big payday and a settlement. And how is that helping me right now? You know, I thought about that. You see, Quinn... If you think I'm gonna be sharing my ultimate jackpot with you... You're dead wrong. You should never have talked to Melissa. Thank you... for fitting me in today, Erin. No worries. Cameron and I go way back to our college days. Anything for him. I need to get my husband out of my house, like today. I can't stand to be around him for another minute. What can I do legally? I hate to be the bearer of bad news. I have some good news for you though! She can't throw me out, right? Why do you say... bad news? You can't just kick your husband out of the house, even though you paid for it, as you said. Exactly. She can't just kick you out, not until the settlement, not with your name on the deed. But, uh, why? It's state law. He still has rights and that is the marriage home. I suggest that you try to reason with him, see if you can get him to leave on his own. I suggest you don't go anywhere, no matter what, and hold out for the best settlement possible. OK. And what if I can't? You may be looking at a year or two before the divorce is final, depending on how hard he fights you. A year or two? What if I can't last that long? Look, I know that he's just hanging on for a huge chunk of cash. Can you give the money to him if it makes him go away? I have reinvested most of my profits back into my business. My other money is tied up in a trust that my parents left for me when I turn forty-five. I'm not gonna let that man blackmail me into giving up my life's work. Oh, you're here! Well, it is my house. Look, this situation with you staying here, it's not gonna work. I mean, I understand why you're upset, babe. Don't call me babe. That part of our relationship is over. Well, there's an easy way out of this if you just think about it. I will give you money for a hotel. I'll even give you money for an apartment deposit. But I can stay here. I talked with a lawyer. You did? Yep. He said I've got every right to stay here, until an appropriate settlement's reached. It's only fair, after all. So what are you really holding out for? Well... you had the best year ever for your company and I was right there by your side the whole time. You want a piece of my company? That, or didn't I hear your company valued at ten million? So, twenty percent of that seems fair. Twenty percent! You're insane if you think I'm gonna give you two million dollars. Besides, that's not how businesses work, Kevin. I'm not liquid for that kind of money. Well, then I suggest you find a way to get liquid. You know, I met with my own lawyer. I'm gonna fight you on this every step of the way. Well, we'll see what happens then, won't we, babe? Don't! I should go to work. Grace: I tried calling you earlier but you never got back to me. Yeah, well, I just had some thing to take care of, OK? Yeah. I, I just... Look, I just need a few minutes to myself! Can you go back inside? Loni's probably looking for you. Yeah, what? Oh, hi. Yeah, yeah, the painting's still available. Yeah. Just give me an hour to get off of work. OK. What is he doing now? Kevin? What is going on? Why'd you do that? Who were those guys? Mm... Just some friends helping me celebrate. Where is the Ordway painting? Well, you see... The one I gave you as a wedding present. I sold it. Of course you did. Yeah, I did, to a collector who just had to have it. And now I've got the money to buy some time on the money I owe, which gives you more time to meet my demands. So you see, I solve problems. I bought you that painting 'cause you went on and on and on about how he was your favorite artist, and you just sold it to pay your bookie? When you say it like that, it sounds bad! OK. You need to listen to me. You know what, Melissa? I don't think your heart has been in this relationship for a long time. Don't flip this back on me! Have you ever thought about just selling your company to give me the money I need? I mean, it's a pretty obvious solution. I can make you just as uncomfortable being here. OK. G'night. What are you doing? Oh, my God! Kevin! I thought I heard someone downstairs. Put that thing away! I didn't even know you had a gun. Sorry. Must have been nothing. G'night. Lou, thank you for coming by last minute like this and thank you for recommending the gardener. Anything for my number one customer! Just something going on with the pipes. I don't know what it is. Hey! What the hell? If you could start on the plumbing issue next, Lou? That would be great. OK. I'm gonna have to shut off the water for a couple of hours and it's gonna be a little noisy. No problem. Take your time. I haven't even had my shower yet! Hey! You can't do this. I most certainly can. You think you can make me uncomfortable by trying to terrify me in the middle of the night? I don't buy that you were investigating the sounds. You were trying to freak me out. So I thought about it, and I can make you just as unhappy, Kevin. You underestimate me. Grace. Grace, please tell me you're not still seeing him. Messing with a married man is not gonna end well, and you know this! You don't know anything about the situation with Kevin and me! Besides, if it weren't for affairs with married men, I wouldn't even have been born, right, Mom? It's the truth though, right? Like mother, like daughter, I guess! And there he was with a gun in his hand, saying that he was checking out a sound. You need to get away from this man, Melissa. This is getting dangerous. No. I am not backing down. He's not driving me out of the dream home that I worked so hard to buy. Can you do me a favor? Name it. Can you reschedule my lunch meeting? Kevin! Yeah. I want you to stay away from my daughter. Do you hear me? Look, I don't know what Grace told you... Don't talk to me like I'm stupid! I know you're sleeping with Grace. You are gonna break her heart. Just what men like you do, huh? Your daughter's an adult and she can spend time with anyone she wishes. Have a great day. Why are you following me? Melissa, I promise to love you and protect you from this day forward. My heart will always be true to you and only you. You're my dream come true. Kevin! Will you do me the honour... of being my wife? But we've only been together for... Are you sure? I've never been more certain of anything in my life. Say yes, Melissa. Yes. Yes, I will marry you! Oh, Lou! Hey. Ready to get going on that hot water heater? Great! Yeah. Come on in. Are we gonna be waking up the mister again today? He's, uh, actually not here. Hm. I just have to, uh, grab a file. I'll be right back. Hello? Hey. I just wanted to check that you had the file with those contracts I needed you to sign. Thank you for the reminder. I'm actually getting them from the car right now. Is something wrong? Kevin never came home last night, but his car is still here. Hm. Maybe he stayed with friends. Maybe. Look, I have the contract. I will bring it with me when I come in today. Sounds good. I don't know, Mary Ann. I find it a little odd that he's still not home. Maybe you'll get lucky, and he'll never come back. It's too easy. Easy has never been part of Kevin's personality. I will see you in a bit. Melissa? Lauren? I need to talk to Kevin. Well, I don't know where he is. Sorry. Look, it's important though. It's regarding Grace. Grace? Whatever. I don't know what to tell you. You know, that was some fight you two had in front of the whole neighborhood. I was sure things were gonna get violent. You know what? It's none of your business. Why don't you focus on your own family? I can't believe it. They found her body two days ago. Murdered it says. But are you certain it's the same woman who confronted you about Kevin? I am. Could Kevin have...? Melissa? A detective is here to see you. Melissa Crawford? Yes, I'm Melissa Crawford. I'm Detective Holloway from the Philadelphia PD. Uh, well, how can I help you? If you wouldn't mind. I regret to inform you that your husband, Kevin, was found deceased this morning. His body was found along a hiking trail. Dead? I realize that, that this is difficult, but we'd like you to come downtown to ID the body and answer some questions at the station. Of course! Do I need a lawyer? Do you? Well, I haven't done anything. Then you should be fine, correct? Cancel all my meetings. What's going on? They found Kevin. He's dead. Ms. Crawford, this is my partner, Detective Wilson. Are you OK, Mrs. Crawford? I'm just still shaken up from identifying Kevin's body. It's all just so hard to believe. Ms. Crawford, from the examination of your husband's body, there was a sharp blow to the head. Meaning? We believe our medical examiner will determine that what caused your husband's death was inflicted by another person. We're still working out the time of death. When was the last time you saw your husband? I, uh... Yesterday morning before work. He never came home last night. Where were you all of yesterday? I, uh, was at work, and then I came home. Do you have people who can corroborate that? Well, sure, most of it. How would you describe your relationship with your husband? We were in the middle of, uh, separating. When you say separating, what do you mean exactly? Had you begun divorce proceedings? I had met with a lawyer. I was planning on filing. I had found out he'd been cheating. Interesting. I never would have hurt him! But your relationship was strained, right? And you said this woman we found recently deceased, a uh, Quinn Spencer was an associate of your husband he owed money to. Correct? Yes. Anyone else you can think of that may have had a conflict with your husband? Well, there's the bookie he owed money to, for one thing. He broke into our house the other night. He threatened me. What was this bookie's name? He didn't tell me. All he said was that Kevin owed him hundreds of thousands of dollars in gambling debts. I will never forget his face. Oh, we have photos of individuals involved in illegal gaming in the area. We'll get you to review some of those. Kevin had a knack for making people angry it seemed. Including you? Well, yeah, sure. I was mad at him but... Does this this look familiar? No. Why? This button was found next to your husband's body. Doesn't match any of his clothes. Well, it could have come from anywhere, right? It's just a plain black button. Perhaps. Can you think of anything else that might help us? No. I, uh... There was a domestic disturbance reported at your house not long ago, right? That was just a spat between me and my husband. Am I free to leave? For now. But don't leave town. We'll call soon to have you come back and look at some pictures, see if you can ID the man you spoke of. We'll also reach out once we get more information from the medical examiner. OK. How are ya? I feel numb. I can't wrap my head around all this. They think that somebody murdered Kevin and I know they're looking at me. Everyone knows that the spouse is always the number one suspect. What am I going to do? Erin is contacting her friend who is one of the best criminal lawyers in the state. What a nightmare. Come on. Let's take you home. It's official. Just got the report on Kevin Davrow. It was murder, wasn't it? Yep. We need to move fast on these leads. I'm gonna need something stronger than a glass of chardonnay. It's gonna be OK, sweetie. Is it? They think someone murdered Kevin. Murdered! And it's apparent from their line of questions that they are looking at me. But I think we should just stay calm. Calm? How am I supposed to do that? Look, I'm sorry. I'm just, uh... It's, it's OK. We get it. I just, I can't wrap my head around all this. If he was murdered... Who did it? Who did it? Who did it? Well, what about all those people he owed money to? What about the guy who was in your house? Well, supposedly, he bought himself some time with the sale of the painting. But you don't know what else may have happened there. Right? True. I really grew to hate Kevin, but I did not want him dead. Is there anything else we can do for you? I just need some time right now. Thank you. Thanks again. Quiet! Don't let your friends hear you. What do you want from me? Hm. I know Kevin's been found dead. And what I need to know now is what did you say to the police about me? I just told them that you broke in my house and that I didn't know your name. Did you, did you murder Kevin? Would've made it much more difficult for me to collect my money, don't you think? I can't afford to be on their radar... so, I'll cut you a deal. A deal? Mm. You make sure you don't ID me and I'll make sure that Kevin's debt, the money I would collect from you if I had to, disappears. You'll never see me again. Why should I trust you? Oh, because... I am a man of my word. Mom! Mom, you need to see this. They, uh... they found Kevin dead. Oh, and I am grateful and all... for what Kevin did for Grace. He put in a good word for her at the new tapas restaurant. Now she's a hostess there. Lauren... I need to talk to Kevin. Well, I don't know where he is. Sorry. Look, it's important though. It's regarding Grace. Can I help you? I'm Loni, the manager. I'm, uh, Kevin's wife, Melissa. Do you have a second to talk? OK. I need to know. Do you think that something was happening between Kevin and Grace? Loni, please? Woman to woman. I've seen a lot in my years of management. So if I had to guess, based on what I observed, I'd say they were most definitely involved somehow. Grace, I need to speak with you. When was the last time that you saw Kevin? What are you talking about? What? Why do you wanna speak to Grace? Grace, do you know anything at all that might help? Grace has nothing to say to you! Does this look familiar? This button was found next to your husband's body. Go back inside, Grace. And you! Get off my property now or I'll call the police! She will speak to me! You cannot speak to her, Grace. Do you understand? No! No! I'm calling the shots now! Are you gonna answer that, Mom? Hello? Ms. Jenkins? Yes? It's Detective Holloway down at Parkside Station. We spoke on the phone regarding the domestic disturbance you witnessed at your neighbors'? Oh, yes. Hi. Could you please come down to the station? We'd like you to make a formal statement. Uh, now? Could, could it wait? I'm sort of in the middle of something. If you could come down now, it would be most helpful. Yes, uh, of course. I, I understand. I'll be right there. Thanks. See you soon. Grace, I need you to listen to me carefully, OK? You have to stay here. Do you understand? Everything depends on it. I have to run down to the police station and give a statement, OK? Everything depends on it. OK. Oh, baby... I'm wondering about the girl next door... Grace? Kevin's boss is sure she's the girl he was having an affair with. And I could tell that the mother was freaked out when I went over to confront Grace about when the last time she saw Kevin was. Also, she's missing a black button on her sweater, and I think it might be the ones a detective showed me. Look, I don't think that you should be running off to be doing your own investigation right now, OK? It could make things more complicated for you than they already are. I know. I'm gonna bring my suspicions to the police. It's the wholesaler. Let me grab that. I'll check on you later, OK? Lauren's not home... Grace! I need to talk to you! It's important. Grace? Are you home? If you are, I'm coming in. I just wanna ask you a few questions. It's important, Grace. Look, I'm not mad about you and Kevin, OK? He was not a very nice man. You're another one of his victims. It's not your fault, OK? Thank you for speaking to us. If you think of something else, please contact me. You really think it was murder though? It maybe was an accident, right? I've always thought that running trail was dangerous. You mentioned your daughter lives with you. Was she acquainted with Mr. Davrow? Um, they worked together. We'll need to speak to her soon too. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I understand. Anything to help. If there's anything else, please let us know. Certainly. Come on. Pick up, Grace! Mom? Mom, you need to come home quick. Melissa's here. She snuck inside and, and, and I, I, I hit her. What have I done? Mom, what do I do? OK, Grace. I need you to pull yourself together and listen to me very closely. Get the gun. Mom? You heard me, Grace. Get the gun. I'll be there as soon as I can. Where's the gun? Where's the gun? Don't... move! Hey. Have you talked to Melissa in the past couple of hours? I tried a bit ago but no response. OK. Well, maybe I'll stop by on the way home then, just to make sure she's OK and that nothing else has happened. OK. I'll join you on my way home too. OK. I'll see you over there. See you. Grace? What are we gonna do? OK. OK. Get the tape in the basket behind me. What is going on? Why are you doing this? We're just taking you home, Melissa. Now get up! Come on. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Move! Move it! Why are we going to my house? Shut up! Just get her inside. What are you going to do with me? Shut up, Melissa, and sit down! I don't understand, Lauren. Why are you doing this? Don't talk! We need a plan, Grace! Are you listening to me? I just wanted him to tell me that he loved me. Why are you following me? Why won't you return any of my calls and texts? Look, there just can't be anything long-term between us, OK? We're just too different. But you said that we would be together after you left your wife. OK. I never said that. That sounds like wishful thinking on your part, babe. Yes, you did! Look, Grace. What we had was a little bit of fun. That's it. OK? You're just a kid. You can't do this to me... to us! Kevin, you said that we would be happy together, that you would protect me! Focus, Grace. Focus! But he, he promised me. It could be... It was just, just, just a robbery. That's it, Grace, a robbery. Grace! Listen! Go upstairs. Find a jewelry box, anything, anything valuable! Oh, God. Someone's here. Melissa? You OK? What are we gonna do? You didn't answer the phone and I got worried. Melissa? I'm coming inside! Is Melissa here? Hold it right there! Make another move and I swear to God I'll shoot her. It's the girl Kevin was having an affair with and her mother! The girl killed Kevin! If Kevin had loved me like he said he would, none of this would be happening. Grace, pull yourself together! Tie him to the rail! Tie him tight, Grace. Tight! We're gonna do her next. There's no way you're gonna get away with this. Look, you need to call the police and turn yourselves in and ask the court for mercy and... Shut up! Nothing matters more to me than my daughter. I'm gonna find a way to fix this. It's what a mother does. A good mother would call the police and put an end... I'm thinking! You don't have to do this, Lauren. Please! I didn't mean to kill him. I can't get up. Grace! Get down here and help me. Help you? You just said that I meant nothing to you! Get down here and help me, now! Grace, move it, you bitch! Hurry up! You promised me. You promised me and gave me nothing! Ah, you crazy psycho! I wish I'd never met you. It just happened. Grace, you need to stop talking! Think about it. Just think about it, Lauren. No one even liked Kevin in the end, right? What are you saying? Maybe no one has to go to jail. You don't want Grace's life ruined because of Kevin, do you? She's right! Why would we let Kevin ruin Grace... your daughter's life? I swear... We won't say anything. We will get our stories straight. We'll give each other alibis. Just think about it. This may be the best way to truly protect Grace! No! What, do you think I'm an idiot? I can't trust you. No! This is gonna end here and now. But if I can make it look like he killed you... No! Wait! Wait! Lauren, you don't have to do this! In a jealous rage, if, if, if he, he was in love with you! Ah, Grace. And this could work. This could work. Ah, damn! Melissa! It's Mary Ann! Mary Ann! Get out! Call the police! There's a gun! No. No! NO! Grace, shoot her! Grace! Shoot her! Shoot her! Kill her! Mom! Mom? No. No, no, no, no, no. Mom? Mom? Grace? Give me the gun. No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! I'm sorry. It's over. OK. This is the last one from the bedroom. Is there space for that? Yeah, there should be. I think she only has one left. This is the last of it, finally. I could not get out of that house fast enough! I think you're gonna love your new condo. Thank you. I could not have made it through to the other side without the two of you. Thank you for being there for me through all of this. You don't have to thank us. We just want you to have some well-deserved happiness. Well, now that we know that Kevin's bookie has been busted by the cops, Good. I feel much more relieved. Why don't we drop these boxes over at your place and then head over to my apartment for some pasta and wine? That sounds amazing! Captions sassonique
