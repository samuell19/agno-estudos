About 25 seconds. Authorization for the launch. - All ready. Twenty. - Ten, nine, eight... - seven, six, five... - Internal management. Four, three, two, one, zero. In 1987, at the John F. Kennedy Space Center... NASA launched the latest US interplanetary space probe. In the payload of the warhead of the huge rocket... I was going a man's exploration ship. The Ranger 3. On board the compact interstellar ship... Captain William "Buck" Rogers... He experienced cosmic forces that were incomprehensible. He saw death closely. In the blink of an eye, unimaginable temperatures froze... Your life maintenance team. Ranger 3 went out of its way... and it entered into a thousand times more extensive orbit... same that returned the ship to the starting point... to Mother Earth... not five months later, but 500 years later. For 500 years, Buck Rogers was adrift in a world where... reality and fantasy merged into an eternal dream. Alert!! Alert! A hostile ship approaches. Clear the platforms to attack. Wait! There's something weird about that ship. I had never seen one like that. Prepare to tow it. Embrace the alien ship in a force field... and prepare her to get on board the Draconia. - Transport of neurosystems. - In transport. Begin heart-lung procedure. - Dilute a minor pressure agent. - Transmitting. Increase diogen and crystalline in proportion. The heart-lung response increased 0.2 and continues to rise. We begin to receive positive neurological signals. Its alive. Ahead. What's so important about the intruder that you could not wait? The man is alive. I'm not sure why. Not sure why? Do I have to decipher the riddle? I must decipher it. The ship is outdated like none I've seen in the star system... or outside the history books. Kane, please. They froze it with a combination of gases. Oxygen, cryogen, ozone, metal. Balanced almost perfectly. They are techniques used in the galaxy for terminal diseases. Yes, at present. However, there is another issue. The ship of man. Kane, you have one more minute. His instruments stopped... frozen in the year 1987. - Are you telling me... - The man could be 500 years old. - Are you serious. - Yes. Frozen by elements so instantaneously and perfectly... which is totally preserved and alive. It is a fascinating idea. - Preserved young or old? - Very young. Are you flawed by the hard experience? Fortunately for him, we are very advanced in cryogenics. I have not met a man of 500 years. Prepare it for a hearing. I think it's possible that he is not coherent. I will be lenient. - Where I am? - We ask the questions. Who are you? Captain Buck Rogers, Air Force of the United States. - Who are you? - What did he say? Something about a united states. Captain, where are you going? - What's going on? - My head. - Does anyone have an aspirin? - What does that mean? It must be some kind of drug to remove the pain. Give him something for his annoyance. What place is this? Where I am? Who are you? It's in the Draconia, the king's flagship... under the command of the royal princess Ardala. - Who? - Where are you from.? Wait, wait, wait. Slower. What did he say about a ship? It is a fortress of the king on the way to Earth on a mission of peace. On the way to Earth? Do you mean to say that you are not... of the... Do you mean we're not... Are not we on Earth? I will definitely need the aspirin. - Give it to her. - Just a moment. Captain. Keep in mind that he is a prisoner... of a dynasty that conquered 75% of the universe. He will respond with care if he values his life. You. Is she a princess of real life? I think we gave our captain too much medicine. No, no, I feel great. The United States of America... It was an empire of the planet Earth a few centuries ago. You took juice from those royal tutors. You are from Earth, Kane. You should know more than me. The United States perished almost 500 years ago. That would explain his ship, his clothes, the instruments. I have a better explanation. I think he's an infiltrator... of the Federal Terrestrial Council. - An infiltrator? - Yes. An Army spy put in our way. They would not dare. I am a real sent from my father's kingdom. I am aware of his father's purpose. Guarantee trade between the Earth and the draconians. What reason would they have to put a spy on board? Check our ship. - See if we are armed. - I see. - We could not allow that, could we? - Do not. Then, I suppose I can dispose of Captain Rogers as he wishes. How you take care of security is your prerogative. Follow me, Tiger Man. Go design Heavens! - How is he this morning? - Fabulous. What a coincidence. I have a ship like this. Disconnect the medication. Oh, do not do that. I really love it. But... - Very soon he will leave. - Great. Where we go? - He'll go home. - Great. Where is that? - On earth. - Oh, sure. We repair and reprogram your ship to take it home. - Sure, he's anxious. - Oh, yes. It seems I've been absent for weeks. Oh. Oh. I should have had a lot of fun with you. You know? I will miss you. I have a great idea. - How about we all go down together? - Come on. We will reach it. Not if I wake up. Goodbye. Oh, what an incredible dream. In Houston you will be surprised when you return with this story. Battery. Prepare to launch the alien ship. Five seconds for the launch. Four... three two... one. Launching. It gave us the opportunity to test the protective shield of the Earth. How to prove it? We know that anyone who enters... without authorization they incinerate it immediately. But if our captain is a spy, as I believe... they will escort him through the shield... along the channel that only the military knows. How can that help us? I hid a microtransmitter in Captain Rogers' ship... who will send us a guided map. When we give the signal... your father's attack forces will use the map... to pierce his protective shield. What if Captain Rogers is not a spy? Then, it will burn. I see. It does not seem very pleased. Of course I'm pleased. But I have a strange feeling that I will see Captain Rogers again. Air control 1 to ship Able, Baker 4. - Here location control. - Approaching. - What is your position and fuel? - Confirmed. Here Tartalia to air control Long. We are approximately... Houston control, here the 711 flight. Answer, control of Houston. Leave the cards and the backgammon. Buck the lucky one came back. Mr. Supervisor? Supervisor ready. What position is it? Delta sector, sir. They do not know about me very often. Yes, delta sector? My scanners monitor the low frequency direct band. I'm getting some voices or something. Sure you get pirate conversations. There is no need to be alarmed. Perhaps they are echoes of last night's attack on the freighters. Those signals will bounce all week. Yes sir. I mean, no sir. This is not an echo, sir. It is a voice. It is a strong voice. Is singing. - Singing? - Yes. - Delta sector, did you say "singing"? - Yes. Operational control, I'm supervisor 14, give me the delta sector audio. Answer, control of Houston. Answer Houston control, here the 711 flight. Answer Do you receive me? Give me instructions. I'm going to re-enter. Answer, control of Houston. Houston control, do you receive me? Anden, papanatas, stop slacking and give me "info". It is practically a foreign language. Is it a joke? Goes directly to the protective shield. Communicate me with interception. With the interception squadron. I'm Colonel Deering. What are the coordinates? Right. Back the shield 160 km. Until checking the ship. Alert, interceptors. Alien ship position. - Thats weird. - What's weird? The target moves very slowly and irregularly to be a ship. I have the target in sight. What is it? Hey, good. I'm glad to see you... boys. Who are they? What are they? Attention, alien ship. Do you listen me? I am "alien"? You are not familiar. Who are they? Limit your answers to "yes" and \ x22. It is in serious danger. Whose? Of you? It crosses a narrow corridor that leads to the inner cities. Cities what? Look, miss... Colonel Deering. Now, keep silent. If you leave the indicated route... It will become steam, do you understand? In steam? Yes Yes, I understand. What should I do? - Can you handle the ship manually? - Clear. Then, follow me very closely. I'm after you. This time they won us. It must be the Russians. He's doing fine. - How do you say? - I'm just trying to be friendly. Violating our airspace is an act of war, not friendship. Wait until the Cape guys find out. Buck Rogers will land in the center of Red Square. Air control 1 access. Cleared in the 1-0 corridor Able for the approaching ship. Confirmed. Open exterior barriers for approach... in the 1-0 corridor Able for the approaching ship. Hey, baby, what a great deal. I'm Colonel Deering, commander of Terrestrial Defense. - You. Are you in charge of all this? - Right. - If there are no more questions... - Hey, Colonel, quiet. I would fly with you whenever you want. - Interrogate this barbarian. - What? Listen. Hey, wait a moment! I waited! What... What do they do? Hey, wait a minute! How are you, Captain Rogers? I am Dr. Huer. I am very happy to meet you. What is happening? Where am I and what do they do to me? We are studying it. Everything is electronic and painless. But we are as astonished as you. For what happened. But his tests give us phenomenal data. Fabulous. What is happening? If I'm dead, I did not go to heaven. What planet is this? What planet? Oh, it's Earth, of course. He returned as his mission demanded... to almost the precise area of scheduled landing on your ship. Look, doctor. I've been through a lot... but in no way will you tell me... that that city is Chicago. No, it is not. There is nothing left on Earth like Chicago. Allow me to bring my administrator, Dr. Theopolis. Look, doctor... Twiki, could you bring Dr. Theopolis, please? - What is that? - He is Twiki. - It's your robot. - My what? During your report and determination... Twiki will be your assistant. And this... This is Dr. Theopolis. Good morning, Dr. Theopolis. It is a beautiful day. Thank you. I did my best. Dr. Theopolis is a member of the Computer Council. And in addition to other things, he is responsible... of the environmental controls of the Internal City. This afternoon I will introduce a touch of mauve at sunset. Not as deep as an amethyst... but a more subtle texture like cinnamon. That's good. I hope the captain sees it with us. It really will be lovely. If it were you, I would talk to the programmer about that thing. Captain Rogers, it's us, the Council... those who do all the programming. Please reserve your opinion. Let's go to work. Captain Rogers, I'll leave you with some advice. These androids were not programmed by humans. They have programmed each other for generations. You see, the mistakes we made... in areas, then, as our environment... they were totally in his hands. And they saved the Earth from a secure end. Little by little we have recovered to not depend totally... from other planets in terms of water and food. Androids are not human, but... You can hurt your feelings. It is this sensitivity that separates them from the machines. I will see it again in about 16 hours. 16 hours? Wait a moment! Do you think I'll stay here and talk with a box for 16 hours? Sit down, captain. Let's try to be as pleasant as possible. That's. Be a good robot, Twiki, and put me on the table... where I can see the captain well while you bring him something to drink. - I do not need anything to drink. - Of course. You're dehydrated from your terrible experience, Buck. If you allow me to call you Buck. Now bring your drink to Captain Rogers, Twiki. Wow, you're a very attractive man, Captain Buck Rogers. Look, I've been waiting 24 hours... to find out where I am, who I am, who you are. Could you give me some answers? Of course, Buck. That's why I'm here, to answer your questions. Great. Begins. You are Captain Buck Rogers, and according to your ship's diary... You left Earth in 1987. I already know that. Tell me what I do not know. If the preliminary data is valid, it seems that you came back... to Earth 504 years later. Now you are in the XXV century. Buck? Are you okay, Buck? You heard me? I think I'm going to drink now. I assure. He is a wonderful man. Trust me. I think you think he's a wonderful man... but you do not risk lives... of our surviving warriors for their subterfuge. He is only a man. How could it endanger our people? I could discredit the treaty with Draconia. He has not tried to do that. He came to us bewildered. I want the opportunity to spend time with our captain. If you look for a defect in your testimony, you lose time. Saving Earth is not a waste of time... despite supporting the company of the captain. Well, if Dr. Theopolis has no objection... I don't have any. I have no objection. The captain belongs to me until I unmask him. I had never seen Colonel Deering... so unusually emotional about something. Nor about someone. This part seems more a dream than a nightmare. Look, my behavior yesterday was inappropriate. I want to apologize. I accept your apology, captain. Tell me about the holocaust. I can not. Well, it's not real until you hear it and feel it. I lost everything that was important to me. Mother, father, brothers, sisters, a woman he loved. If I do not hear something that convinces me... They will be waiting for me somewhere in time and space. - How is the exterior? - From the city? I would not like it. - Radiation? - In some places. The rest are ruins and scorched earth. We depend on trade with other planets. Tell me about the trade agreement with the draconians and with the princess. The pirates who cut our transport routes kill us with hunger. The draconians promised to keep them open... in exchange for giving them landing privileges on Earth. I would like to see my ship. It's possible? Anything is possible, captain. Those guards thought it was crazy to come at this time. I already slept an eternity. Do you recognize those brands? They are common in ships that were in combat. Well, I was not in combat. You. They shot me? - Of course not. - Then who? Maybe the pirates who attacked us. And why am I still here? Why did not they kill me? Why did not they strip her or open her? The pirates are meticulous, they would check an unarmed ship... especially one that was shot. He was in flight a long time. Anything could happen. Those brands are new. Cordite has not oxidized. I think Princess Ardala's ships shot me... before towing me inside his ship. - Your ship is unarmed. Is the law. - Well, it seems he's raping her. What do you suggest, Captain? Have them check their ship before letting it go through its protective shield. It would be an insult. The alliance is based on good faith. Good faith is for bureaucrats and what gives them a protected city. I would go armed to the teeth or they will be easy prey. For someone whose expertise is five centuries old... You seem to be very inflexible. Is right. It's not my business how they ruin your world. My generation did not know what I was doing either. - Good evening, Colonel. - Where are you going, Captain? - I'll go around the city. - He's under suspicion. Can not. I have to find out what changed in 500 years. - That is forbidden. - Is a free country. At least, it was. He is arrested and is my prisoner. I can not let him go. He will have to shoot me to stop me. It does not leave me an alternative. You did not have to come with me. I wanted to be with you. I wish you listened to reasons. This is nothing compared to what awaits us. - Why do not we spend the night here? - Oh, we would die frozen. The heat that you feel is emanated by the Inner City. Within a few hours, the energy will be reduced by two thirds... and the temperature here will be below zero. So, I guess we have to continue. I'm sorry I brought them. They assigned me to be with you. No one forced me to be on your side. I believed in you and I still do it. What did he say? - You do not want to know. - Oh. - What did he say now? - You do not want to know. Come back I can face whatever is there... if it helps me discover what happened to my people. I'll stay with you, Buck. - What did he say? - You do not want to know. - Stop saying that! I want to know. - He thinks they're watching us. It's just your imagination. Walking. - It is impossible. Totally impossible. - We'll be fine. - It's not you they want. - What? Do not be offended, but they want us. My gold circuits are worth a lot in the black market. And as for Twiki, well, I'd hate to tell you how they'll use it. Buck, where are you going? STATE STREET It's here. I do not want to question your strategy, Buck... but to stop in the middle of the street is stupid... Given the circumstances. Come! I do not know where he is going. Just follow him. I do not know what he does. Just follow him, Twiki. - Holy... - I know, Twiki. I see them. Just keep going. Do not think about that. Your batteries will be exhausted. Here my parents are buried. At least I already know a part. We can not stay long, Buck. They are following us. What happened? There is only one gravestone, it has no date. They only buried some lucky ones. It happened so fast that they buried the families together. The systems fell and the dates stopped being important. In the end, there were no armies or fighting. Only hunger, pollution and prolonged death. - I wish I had been with them. - You can not go back, Buck. The past is gone. But you can help us with our future. If there is a future. I think it's too late. Run, Twiki. Watch out! Damned... They are too many, Buck, it has no case. If someone has some final words, now it's time to say them. Let's get out of here. Go, Colonel. What brings you here on a night like this? Captain, I came to look for you with great danger for me. - Very courageous. - Very what? Forget it. Well, do not expect a fanfare. We were fine until you arrived. Right, Theo? - Well... - Forget it, Theo. Well, at least Twiki is on my side. I like it here. It's a bit primitive, but it's the south side of Chicago. Captain, we waste our time. Let's move on. I still do not finish. So unless I'm going to shoot myself... Captain, he escaped once, but not now. Lieutenant. What is the problem? So, it does work for pirates. - I still can not believe it. - Well, you're the only one, Theo. This microtransmitter was on your navigation device. Revealed our secret access corridors. This is not how an innocent man behaves. At first I thought I was guilty. And later... They are subjective in their evaluation of Buck Rogers. I, on the other hand, support it for practical reasons. - And which are they? - I'm convinced of something. Our friend, Captain Rogers, met Princess Ardala... and was aboard the draconian ship. Your descriptions are too precise... to be the conjectures of a pirate. Maybe the pirates boarded that ship and gave him the information. Precious, they are the deadliest enemies. It is unlikely that a pirate survived such a visit... to tell it. There's news from Captain Rogers. They intercepted her ship and escorted her... as I expected. The transmitter that we installed in your ship gave us the necessary information... so that my father crosses the shield? Yes, but they discovered the transmitter. - That bad. - That does not change things. When we enter, we will destroy the shield from within. The earthlings will not suspect... when he tells you he was here? They will not believe you. We can give Captain Rogers for dead. Stop worrying about the trial. I am a member of the Council and I will personally defend you. Thanks, Theo. It is good to have at least one friend. Forgive me, Twiki. Two friends. The Council is ready to hear the final arguments... in the case against Captain Buck Rogers... on charges of espionage and treason. - Lawyer Apol. - The case of the State is elementary. The captain flew through our defense network... with a microtransmitter, revealing the accesses of the shield. What reward would you consider fair... Captain Rogers for selling to the human race? Only your pirate friends can respond. But I maintain that in my opinion... what they seek at all costs is the destruction of the treaty with Draconia. Since its promulgation means its downfall. The State finished presenting its case. Now we will hear the defense. Dr. Theopolis. Distinguished colleagues, you heard the evidence... and I challenge you to find this man guilty. There is no evidence to indicate that he was born on this planet... because we all know very well... that there are no records prior to the great holocaust. He can not explain how the transmitter came to his ship... because it is not his work. He is an innocent pawn in a great war. I tell you, colleagues, if you find this man guilty... You must find me guilty. My sensors tell me that this man is good. The defense finished presenting its case. Thank you. Captain Rogers, do you have any last words before we give the ruling? I'm just an innocent pawn, a puppet, whatever they call me. It was another who manipulated me. They should worry less about me and more about them. Because I can not harm them anymore no matter what the result is today. But he or she... I could destroy them. Very good, Buck. We do not have to worry. Unanimously, the Council rules in favor of the State. Captain Rogers, the Council finds you guilty. Your life will end. The execution will be carried out immediately. The session is over. I can not believe it. Will not say anything? - Do not. - That's ridiculous. He was sentenced to death. At the very least, he would think that a man of his type would be furious... that would attack me verbally, that I would say something. Goodbye? Buck, enough. It is being unreasonable. Am I being unreasonable? It is almost as if he believed that the sentence will not be carried out. I do not think there is anyone here who carries out the sentence. I know that you will not be in charge. He still clings to his story that the Draconia is armed. I can prove it. What would you say if I said... I came to give you that opportunity? How? We will go to the Draconia flagship to verify its history... that they found it. And will they investigate while they are there? Exact. No no. I... I do not like that plan. - It worries me. - Why? Well, you see, my execution is scheduled. If I do not show up, I'll get in trouble. You are impossible. Do I offer his life and he answers me with jokes? That's what it means. Does it offer to end my execution or just postpone it? If he shows that his story is real... Walking. Stay close to my ship. The maneuvers will be simple. Stay on automatic pilot. It will only control the acceleration. Thanks, colonel. Can I look out the window? This is no time for frivolities, Captain. The pirates destroyed a third of our ships here. When they attack, they attack fast. It can not beat the computer. It will take evasive measures to evade its missiles. If you try to fly, it will only cost one ship. I appreciate your concern. I wish I had brought a book. I have a goal in vector 401. Aware, Colonel. I see the target to port. If you see it at this distance... It must be giant. Permit to board? Why? He is a special envoy. That's all I know. This does not conform to the protocol. - What do you think they're up to? - I don't know. But they warned us in advance. And there will be nothing that betrays us. I would like to know what they are up to. Let's prepare them a very special welcome. Send our pirate ships. And prepare a surprise for them. Welcome aboard the Draconia flagship... sent from Draco, conqueror of space... leader of Astrium, ruler of the draconian kingdom. I present your daughter, Princess Ardala. Haunted. This is an unexpected pleasure. We can hardly receive them properly. Your time is an adequate reception. I am Col. Deering, commander of the 3rd Terrestrial Council Force. And I think you already know Captain Rogers. No. If I had met a young and dashing captain... I would surely remember it vividly. I do not think we had the pleasure. I think he's wrong, princess. I never forget a knuckle. - Captain. - We want to get to the bottom of the matter. Do I describe some of the interior cameras? What interior cameras are you referring to? I do not find it memorable, but I will never forget it. I especially liked the high neck dress and... Colonel Deering, what's wrong? Why you came? Pirates are in this sector. We came to make sure they arrived safely. Alert! Alert! Alert! Hostile ships attack the Draconia. And Captain Rogers... All staff to their defense posts. - Men, to your ships! - Alert to all posts! This is how they offer us protection. Go escort. At least we will die together. Clear launch channels to attack. Alert!! Alert! Care, greater. It is behind you. Climb, I'll intercept it. Not there! He goes to his sight! Captain Rogers, I ordered you not to interfere. Colonel, you need all the help available. - Bandit at 12.00, up. - At 12.00 what? Lieutenant Wrather, ignore it. Captain Rogers, shut up. Computers are superior to you. If your computers do not do something fast... they're going to eliminate their lieutenant Wrather. Be careful, Thornberry! Colonel, you must change to manual flight. If it does not stop distracting our pilots... Help the lieutenant. There are a couple of pirates behind you. I'll change to manual, Colonel. Let's see if I can share what we have been receiving. Buck Rogers, I order him to return to base. Now let's see if they like to send the defensive load to the old one. I destroyed one. Six are missing. I gave you! - Lower and turn on the rear propellers! - I can not! It goes against the principles of modern air combat. That is called sending the load with the linebackers. I do not know what happened to the combat computers... but thanks. Now, captain, let's go home. - Mine or yours? - What? - What did he say? - Just kidding. Air control 1 access. 1-0 Runner Able cleared for approaching ship. Confirmed. Open exterior barriers for approach... in the 1-0 Able corridor for the approaching ship. Colonel Deering, have you seen Captain Rogers? Yes because? The Council received a request from Princess Ardala. What does that have to do with the captain? She thinks that he only saved... to his unarmed ship of the renegade pirates... and he wants to thank you personally. He alone? Apparently, they almost destroy your ship too. If it was not for Captain Rogers' ability... and his quick reaction, the princess thinks... I do not care about the opinion of the princess. I know what happened. I was there. Tomorrow I will conquer Earth. Tomorrow we will conquer the Earth, your highness. You look great, Buck. Something bothers you? Why did you invite me to this? Nobody believes me. Princess Ardala wants to thank you for protecting her ship from pirates. I would also like to tell you something... In private. I'm sure they will not allow it. After all, you're just a captain. And you do not even have an officer's degree. - Do you have something for the headache? - You feel bad? I guess I'm not fully recovered from my trip. Why did not you say something? Twiki will bring you a relaxing one. Well, it's time to enter. Let's not wait for the trade delegation. Welcome. The draconian trade delegation... under the leadership of his royal highness... the princess of the kingdom. Ardala. I bring you greetings on this historic occasion. My father, King Draco... wants to give them their flagship Draconia... full of the latest technology. It symbolizes a new glorious era... of commerce and peace. Let the celebration begin. We brought you some pills, Buck. For your headache. It is a very strong relaxant. Do not take more than one at a time. Thanks guys. I see that the dance has advanced a lot in 500 years. I will need something else. A rose. - You said a rose? - Yes, red. - What do you need a rose for? - Twiki, can you bring me a quick one? Do you like our presentation, Captain Rogers? Is awesome. Did this folkloric dance come from your dad's world? Excuse me, but I did not understand what he said. And I suggest you use a more respectful reference than "dad". Maybe he's the greatest leader we know. I'll give you a warning, Colonel. - Beware of gifts from the Greeks. - The Greeks? That was before you were born. A long time ago. Tell me, do you know the history of the Trojan horse? Do not. No, huh? Well, forget it. I guess I'm from a time that was paranoid. See you. - Your rose, Buck. - How cute. Thanks, Twiki. Buck, nobody gave flowers to the princess. You will make everyone look ridiculous. Do not separate, friends. We follow. Go, Captain Rogers. Congratulations and thanks. We are grateful to you for saving us from those horrible corsairs. Not so strong. Here they believe that I am a corsair, thanks to you. To me? I wish I had not made him go through much shame. - Are you angry? - From... - The O! - What a great body. - From me to you. - Who is your lovely little friend? It's called Twiki. Yes, and that thing hanging from his neck is Theo... Member of the Computer Council. - Your Majesty. - Do you want to dance with me? - The princess does not... - It does not bother me to dance. I'm not up to date with these steps. If you have a preference... It's my party. Fantastic. How about something old-fashioned? Sir, excuse me. Do you know rock? You know... Try it, try it Ande. No, no, that's not it. Just let yourself go. Let go. Let yourself be carried away by the music. That's. Right. Yes. That's. Yes. That makes? It's called juerguear. It's old. If you scare her... Nothing scares me. Very good. Come stomping. - It's expressive. - It's nasty! - What happens if we crash? - Automatically we are husband and wife. Great. A juerguear. You are a special man, Captain Rogers. I think the earthlings believed his story... of having been frozen 500 years. - It is not like this. They think I'm a spy. - My own? - They are not sure. - Do you want to join me? - Who do I talk to negotiate with? - With me. Tell me, is that building still the communications center? It is secret information. Of course. I will always be one of you, Dr. Huer. Maybe I'll stay here permanently. We hope so. Your Highness, some ministers want to talk to you. - Then, Kane. - The affairs of the kingdom come first! His father hopes that it serves the interests of the kingdom. If you do not... He has another 29 daughters who will! It was a pleasure, Captain Rogers, but we must do our duty. Later? I'll leave on my private ship at midnight. I'll be there. Captain Rogers. I would like to know if it is a good time to talk to you. The princess left suddenly... and it seems that the party was over. He has no plans, do he? - Well... - Very good. - There's something I want to say. - Well I... I thought he was a spy, Captain Rogers. I was wrong. Do you want to go somewhere else? I'm not ready for that yet. I have not done it for a long time. 500 years. My reintegration should be calm. Do not worry. Better listen to it, friend. It is reasonable. I asked Captain Rogers to accompany us. You're lucky not to fight with me. We are almost there. Where are you going? I know it's cold, but we have no choice. We have orders to stay close to Buck. And maybe he needs us, so he goes back to the refrigerator. Twiki, I'm talking to you. I freeze the ball bearings. Captain Rogers does not appear anywhere. What did you expect from a primitive? We will let you know if we know anything about him. You're a spy, Buck Rogers... and I know exactly where you are. Outside. They are better pets if you castrate them. Let's get comfortable. Serve us something to drink. At last we are alone. You will not say anything? Until this moment I did not know what I was missing. I also have to confess something. Is there a man waiting for you at home? I had not realized what I was missing. You are different. You are arrogant. You flagrantly ignore the orders. And you're the kind of man who could overthrow my father. Overthrowing your father is the last thing on my mind. - I brought you here for a reason. - I was counting on that. I want you by my side. That was not exactly what I was thinking. Consider it. You have no idea what it is to be the daughter of Draco the Conqueror. 29 sisters on your heels. Cortesanos snitches like Kane competing for power. But with a man... a true man like you... I could challenge my father, I could live my own life. - Yes? - A new magnificent dynasty. Are not you getting ahead of the facts? Now give me my drink. - We have to be very careful. - Oh yeah? The moment is not the right one. Things never change. This has always been the case. Why did not I meet you before, Buck Rogers? We have a lot of time, do not we? Weapons personnel show up on the platform to load the weapons. Look, they're sleeping down there. The fools will never know what happened. I am very relaxed. Can you turn off the lights? If you are a spy, I will have to kill you. If those are the things you say in bed, I found your problem. This is not good at all, Twiki. There are soldiers everywhere... and we do not even know where to start looking for Captain Rogers. Caramba! Let's see if we can find your pajamas. The pirate ships. This is how they could attack us. It was his own people. - Where is the Tiger Man? - I do not know, sir. Go away! Did you wake up, my love? Did you wake up, baby? Shoot him! Outside! Take it out! Take it out! Execute it! - No. Take him for questioning. - Are you giving a counter order? Under the circumstances, yes. Obey me. Take it. You will have to give me explanations. Do I have to explain? Well, it's not a Gucci, but what does it matter? I do not want to be caught either. But something is very wrong and we must find out what it is. I hope you know that this violates my guarantee. Obviously she has been... very worried. Then I'll take care of you for your insolence. Give the order to attack now. We can not attack without the support of his father's forces. Kane, how weak you are! We do not need my father. We have the element of surprise. We will destroy the Inner City and the protective shield. When my father's forces arrive... we will be sitting on the throne of the Earth. At least I do, since obviously you do not have the courage. Very well, we will attack. It's a wise decision, Kane. Meanwhile, Captain Rogers is loose on the ship. Find them. Alert!! Alert! Intruder aboard the ship. Alert! Alert! Alert! It's Buck. I see. Bring on the enemy's uniform. This will warm your tail. They are warships. It means that the treaty is a hoax. But we can do a last service to our country. We can take care of Captain Rogers. Six minutes to attack and count. Five minutes to attack and count. - Do not move, Captain Rogers. - Theo, Twiki, what are you doing here? - This will not be pleasing to anyone. - Can you go? I have work to do. - We realize, traitor. - Do not you realize what's going on? - I'd say they're going to bomb the Earth. - Do you recognize the ships? - No, but I do not see how... - They are pirate ships. Why would there be pirate ships in the draconian flagship? Forgives. You do not convince me. Now join us. - 4 minutes to attack and counting. - Do not. Look, pile of electronic nonsense, I do not expect you to know everything... But did you hear that the bombs were in the tubes? Silence, Twiki. I'm getting confused I'll help you clarify things. There are no pirate ships, there never were. They are draconian bombers disguised as looters. They interrupted the routes to force them to sign the treaty. Of course. It's witty, if it's true. Three minutes to attack and count. You have ten seconds to decide if you believe me or Kane. - Go alternative. - And you do you think? - Can not you see I'm telling the truth? - Yes. If you do not want to become spare parts, follow your instincts. Well, but only if you help us reach a communicator... to be able to warn the Inner City. They will have to do it alone. I have to make sure these ships do not take off. Commander Kane. There is an unconscious guard on platform three. - Two minutes to attack. - Time is up, Theo. - They found the guard I knocked out. - Very good. We will do our part. Good luck, Buck. Come to the console, Twiki. Now, take the center panel. - Ninety seconds to attack. - Let it go. Grab the circuits and pull them. 80 seconds to attack and count. 70 seconds to attack and count. Come to the microphone. 60 seconds to attack and count. Terrestrial Council, emergency channel. Answer please. Colonel Deering online. I'm Dr. Theopolis. Yes doctor. Where are you? Why are you calling here? I'm aboard the Draconia ship. I followed Captain Rogers as I was ordered. Listen out. The Draconia is not... I repeat, it is not an unarmed ship. It's full of bombers ready to launch... a large-scale attack on the Inner City. Where did they come from? His platform was empty. - Send the fighter squadrons now! - Thank you Doctor. Good luck. Dr. Huer, permission to send the fighters. 20 seconds to attack and count. Battle positions. Prepare for the launch! - Ten seconds to attack. - Prepare to attack. Eight, seven, six... five seconds for the launch. Four three... two one. Attack! What's going on? What happens? - Our ships simply exploded. - It is impossible! Here the Earth Council. Attack the bombers; Us, to the main ship. There are no bombers. They explode as soon as they come out. That makes no sense. Take out our warships! Prepare to intercept. Do not use combat computers. I unplug it. Ladéate to the right! I shot him! Two come below. I'll shoot the one above. I go after the other. Take that and that! Oh, hell. You will be responsible for the damage suffered by this platform. I am very sorry that you have come to this. In the center and inside! Preparation for transmission with King Draco. In the name of the kingdom, what is happening? Are they attacking when my ships are still hours away? I only obey orders. And the orders of whom you obeyed? Those of your daughter, sir. Did he order our ships to disintegrate upon entering combat? If either of them survives the greatest disaster in the kingdom... They will give me accounts! Stop fighting the fighters, we will destroy the mothership. Emergency.! Emergency.! Emergency! This was his work, your highness. I should leave her to burn with the ship... But I want her alive so she can render an account to her father. I have an emergency ferry ready to go. It will bring us close enough to his father's ships. Emergency.! Emergency! Emergency.! Emergency.! Emergency! The ship is going to explode. Remove the ships from the impact area. Theo, I'm going for you and Twiki. Forget us. Save Buck - Buck? Wilma, he destroyed the entire fighter fleet alone. - He sent us to warn you. - See me on the flight deck. We'll find Buck. Emergency.! Emergency! Theo, Twiki, over here! I'm glad to see you again, Buck. - This powder magazine is going to explode. - Help is on the way. - How do you help? - Wilma will come to rescue us. What? You can not land here. He will die. Emergency.! Emergency! - Will explode. - Over here, Buck. Through the smoke. Cab! Cab! - Let's move on. The powder magazine is going to explode. - I have the same opinion. Get up. Very well done. Thank you. But we are not out of danger yet. We would already be the rulers of the Earth... if Buck Rogers had not tackled! He would not have been necessary if you were more man. We owe you more than an apology, Buck, especially me. I confess that I thought the princess had coaxed you. Well, I'll say that she had the best pair of... horns in the dance. Yes, it was an attractive hat. You will never be as man as Buck Rogers. We'll see when we see Mr. Rogers again. - And we will. - I hope so. Buck... I know I've been distant with you and cold. I was afraid, afraid to get involved. Now things will be different between us. I'm not just a professional. I am as woman as the princess. How good. And, from now on, I'll show you. What? Well, I guess we'll never see Kane again... nor the princess. The eyes in front. - You will get sick. - Buck, I like you very much.
