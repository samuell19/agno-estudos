I became a runner when I was young. I felt the power of myself only when I was in motion. My legs pumping hard, wind in my face. But I wasn't the kind of runner who did it for the thrill of victory. I never expected a trophy. I was a different kind of runner. Some people say they're born with nothing. But that's a lie. You think hard enough and you can find something that belongs to you and only you, even if it's running away of something I got. I never forget that. Come on, sweetie, we're running late. I'm hurrying. How many times have I told you that the sugary cereal is for weekends only? -Sorry, Mom. -All right. Um, I'm gonna be going out tonight after work, so the babysitter will pick you up from school, and I promise I won't be late. You always say that. And I never am. You just think I am, jellybean. You always say that, too. Come on, hurry up. Hey. It's just me. Dave. God, you scared me. Sorry, I didn't... I didn't mean... How are you? You okay? -Yeah. -Uncle Dave! How's my favorite niece? -Great. -Yeah? Well, I've missed you so much. Have you come to stay with us? No, Breea, this is just a quick visit. I just really needed one of your hugs. I talked to Mom last night. -Breea, go get in the car now. -Why? 'Cause we're late for school, all right? Now say goodbye to your uncle and go jump in the car. See ya. -I thought we had an agreement. -I know but I just... Damn it, Dave. She sounds old, Michelle. I don't care. She wants to see you. Ha. I don't care. I don't care. Why do you keep doing this to me? I'm not doing anything. I just think you could talk to her. We're running late. Is, um... Is Uncle Dave still sick? I don't know, honey. How was your weekend? Perfect. Drinks with the girls Saturday night and brunch with Peter on Sunday. Very relaxing. Here's today's files. And your 9:00 a.m. are here, Mr. and Mrs. Clark. They're new to California. They said they called a couple of days ago about a mortgage. Yes. Thank you, Rose. Good morning. I'm Michelle. Chris Clark. This is my wife, Sandi. -Hi. -We spoke on the phone. Yes, yes. It's very nice to meet you. Have a seat. So here is my card. If I'm ever not at my desk, you can reach me on my cell. So how are you liking California so far? What's not to love? It was snowing in Buffalo when we left in October. -Here's my card. -I mean, I hated leaving family, but Chris's company offered him an amazing job, and we just couldn't really turn it down. Well, it is a very difficult transition. I moved out here about 15 years ago. But once you spend a winter in Southern California, you never go back. Is that your daughter? Yes, it is. She's beautiful. So how can I help you today? Well, we think we may have found a house. And I love it. And we're hoping for a mortgage. That's great. I'll get you an application for pre-approval, and we'll get the ball rolling. So just the one kid for you and your husband? Just me, no husband, and we're fine. Here. I just need you to fill this out... Sorry. I didn't mean to pry. Not a problem, Mr. Clark. Thanks. And what about her father? Gone, long gone. And a girl like you, all to herself, right? Guy would have to be crazy. That's sweet. Just the facts. Most men, when they hear the word "daughter," bolt for the door. Do they really? Check. Most of them. I'm not looking for a father or a husband, if you know what I mean. Well, how do you feel about kissing? I like it. I'm actually quite good at it. Is that right? Yeah, just the facts. Thank you so much, and I'll see you on Thursday. I had a great time tonight, Michelle. Me too. - So I... - Look, I don't normally... I mean, would you like to have a drink? Yes. That would be nice. Okay. Well, I'm gonna go check on my daughter. And there's some wine in the kitchen, so why don't you pour us two glasses? Sure. Sleep tight, mama is home. -Mom? -What is it? I'm scared of the people at the window. There's no one at the window. It's just the wind. Come on, go back to sleep. And... Bear... will protect you. Good night, Mom. Good night, baby. First, I'm gonna congratulate you all in a great month. We have surpassed all of our goals. Our deposits and retention rates are the third highest of all the branches. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Who won the passes? Okay. All right. This month's employee of the month with two all-inclusive passes to SeaWorld is... - Walter. - Yes. Congratulations. And congratulations to all of you. You're a really great team. Thank you so much. Thanks. You all right? I have a headache. Can I get you anything? No. I didn't get much sleep last night. 8:25, armored truck delivery. Hello, ladies. Good morning, Reggie. Michelle, you looking lovely as usual. So, when are we hooking up? Michelle is looking for a real man, Reggie. So what are you saying, I'm not a real man? Yeah, I don't understand why you got to be out there looking for hamburger when you got a prime rib like me walking up in here all the time. -You're married. -I never said I wasn't married. I said I was prime rib. Being married ain't got nothing to do with being prime rib. All right, enough, both of you. This is a bank, not a high school. I guess that would explain all the money then, wouldn't it? How about you finish your homework and I'll let you pick our movie? You always let me pick our movie. That's right, that's because I'm the best mom in the world. Hey, no snacking. So much for being the best mom in the world. Smarty pants. Don't you think it's a little loud? I like it like this. -What? I can't hear you. -Yes, you can, Mom. Turn down. -I can't hear you. -Breea, I'm serious. Hello? Hello? Mommy! Mommy! Mom! Mommy! Mom! Mommy! No. Breea. No! - Wait. - Mommy! No. No. - Give me that. - Mom! No, please! Don't hurt her! Don't hurt her! Don't hurt her! Please don't hurt her. Leave her alone. Shut up or we'll shoot your kid. No, don't touch her! Breea! Shh! No, please don't hurt her! I have money. I have money. You can take whatever you want. Please. Please just... You can take whatever you want, but don't, please... Don't hurt my baby, please. Don't hurt us. Shut her up. No, baby. No, baby! Baby. Baby, don't bother. Just bite. -Mom! -Baby, it's gonna be okay. Please don't... don't hurt my baby, please. Do the kid. You wanna play rough? You wanna play rough? Hey, hey. Shut the house and cut the lights. You... Shh, shh. We are inside and secure. Keep your eyes open. I'm gonna ask you a few questions and see if I can trust you. If you tell the truth, you're gonna pass the test. But if you lie, I'm gonna hurt your little girl. Those are your options, A or B. You got that? Are you hooked up to a security system? You should be. There's a lot of crazy people out there. Shh, shh, shh, shh... It's okay. It's okay. What about your daughter? Does she have a cell phone? Careful mommy like you, kid doesn't have a cellphone? So... You'll cooperate? Because if you don't, I will go in that room and I will kill your little girl like that. Please let me see my daughter. Let me see her, please. Let me... Shut up. You know what I'm gonna take from you? No. Please. Not in front of my little girl, please. Anything I want. You see, you... No more power here, little Miss Bank Manager. I know everything about you, Michelle Estey. What about your boyfriend? Is he coming over tonight? No, I... I don't have a boyfriend. What did I just say? What did I say about lying to me? Little Breea... Don't hurt her. ...goes to West Park Elementary. She's got little pink shoes and a little pink lunchbox. And you've got one chance of keeping her alive! -Do you follow what I'm saying? -Yes. -You do? -Yes. Then don't lie to me! Make me trust you. Okay. I will. I will. What do you want from us? I'll tell you what I want. You are gonna rob your bank for me. What do you mean? Money 1, you read? What's going on? Everything's cool. I thought that you were gonna keep me posted. We had a plan. The plan is that you keep your eyes open out there. That is the plan. Now stop calling me. Where's my daughter? Where's Breea? Breea! Breea! Breea. That's better. Yeah. Are you gonna behave? All right. I wanna know how much is in that bank. A million? No. Look, we are a small branch. We've never had that much money in the bank ever. Hey! How much? Now! Somewhere between 350,000 and 400,000. I've been watching that bank for two months. 8:25 on the nose, courier, one guard, three sometimes, four bags. So don't even think about telling me there's only 400 Gs in that bank! Believe what you want. That's how you did it? You pulled yourself up from nothing, you were just tough, you're tough as nails in there. I like it. I told you the truth. I told you what I know. Now let me see my daughter. Where's your manners? Please. Bring in the girl. One wrong move, and it will be your last. But I don't have to tell you that again, do I? No. Breea, are you okay? Baby, it's gonna be okay. Mama's here. I'm here. You'll be okay. Untie her. Please. Fast learner. No, you're scaring her. No, don't. Let me untie her, please. Please, you have to trust me, right? Let me do it. All right, thank you. It's okay. Baby! Baby, it's okay. Your mom is here. Mom is here, all right? Mommy. It's all right. You're so brave. You're my brave little girl. It's gonna be okay. It's okay. You're my brave little jellybean. Mommy. I know. Mommy... I have to go to the bathroom. Please. Come on, baby, just hold my hand, don't let go. Go bathroom now baby. Hurry up. Looking for something? Need some light? You aren't supposed to be in here. I know, baby, I know. Do your business. Or were you lying to me? Answer me! Do your business. It's not gonna work. I can tell you right now, so you might as well just leave. And there'll be no questions. You're smarter than that. I'm not gonna be in the bank. Just you. And you are gonna do everything that I tell you. Bones, show her. What is that? Dynamite. This here, it's a remote detonator. So if you don't bring me my money... -Boom. -What kind of animals are you? You're sick! Just get out of my house right now! Maybe I need to shut that mouth for you? Yes! Yes! Go ahead, do it! Do it! Hit me! Go on! Hit me! Do it! Let everyone see a bruise. Then your plan will work. Now my daughter needs to sleep. Get in. -Take it off. -Not with you watching. You're a mess. Now clean yourself up. It's too tight, I can't breathe. Remote detonator. You know what that means? Means that I can blow you up from hundred yards away. That's a microphone. And anything that you say, I'm gonna hear it. Anything that I don't like, you're dead. No second chances. Put this on and do it really nice. Just one of my fingers on this button, and you're gone. Do not mess around when you are in there. I can hear every word you say, every move you make. Do not forget who is in charge of you. Where's Breea? This bag's for the money. I want you to find a purse that will fit it. I'm not doing this without her. Where is she? You remember what I said about trust? Your daughter trusts you. And she's waiting for you to tell her that everything is going to be okay. That is all she wants. Do not fail her. Button it. Baby. Money 2 to Money 1. Over. -Hey. -Go. It's time. Delivery is in 45 minutes. How does it look out there? Be brave, jellybean. You be brave. I promise I'm coming back for you. Clear. Everything is in place. I promise. All right, we are coming out. Love you. Hey, let's go. I love you so much. I love you. Don't touch me! Be brave. I'm coming back. I'm coming back. Delivery is a Parker at First. It'll be there in a minute. Okay, Michelle Estey Bank Manager, you're up. You're gonna get out of this car, you're gonna go get my money. Remember, I'm gonna hear every word that you say. I understand. Here it comes. There's your man Reggie. Exactly ten minutes at 8:35 you're gonna get a phone call. It's gonna be from Raymond Howell. -Who's he? -He doesn't exist. Once you get that call, you've got exactly one minute to be walking out that door with my money. Anything happens and you're not back in this car, it will catch you and your daughter in the next life. - It's time. - Go! Good morning. Running a little late this morning. Reggie, can we drop the small talk? I'm in a hurry today. Sure. No problems. Okay. All right, there you go. All right. Thank you, Reggie. Yeah. Well, see you tomorrow. Okay. What? Shh. Shh. What? My g... What? They have Breea. Please. You have to help me. They will hurt her. Please. Help me. Please. No. What are you d... Breea. No one in or out until I go. If you don't do this, they will kill Breea. They will kill her. Promise. Thank you. Michelle. Hey, Michelle. There is a Raymond Howell on line three. He says it's urgent. Michelle, stop. You forgot this. Get in! Move! Come on! Go, go, go! Okay, now what? Shut up and just drive. You got your money... Hey, hey, I give the orders here. Call the others. Get that bomb off Breea. I did everything you said. Get it off of her. We have a problem. Michelle just left here with all the cash in the vault. What? She told me she was being forced to do it. There was a bomb taped to her. Are you joking? She told me not to set off the alarm, not until... That makes us accessories. She said her little girl's life is in danger. She said that we can't do anything about it. I'm pressing the alarm. Walter, her little girl. We can't just... How do you know she's telling the truth? She just robbed the bank. No. We wait until she calls. Turn right and pull over. What about Breea? You said... Get out now! Take me home. Get out of the car! Now! Go. Down. Get down. Get on your knees. Please. I did everything you said. -Shut up! -Please. As soon as I leave, you are gonna start counting. Once you get to 50, then you can move. Your car is gonna be parked over there in the back. -Please take me home. -I'm warning you, Michelle Estey, from now until the day that you die, I will be there, I'm gonna be watching you, every move you make, every person that you talk to. Now count. One, two, three, four, five, six... Forty-five, forty-six, forty-seven... She's not gonna call. We have rules. We can't go down with her for this. Breea? Breea! Breea, baby. Where are you? Breea. Breea. Baby! Baby, where are you? Breea! Breea? Baby, I'm here. I'm here, baby. I'm here. I'm here. Okay, it's all right. -I'm here. -Mommy. -Shh! -Mommy. Please help me. -Yes, baby, I will. -I know, I know. -Mommy. -Come on. Just look at me. That's it. On your knees. That's it. Put your arms up. Put your arms up, okay? -Mommy, please. -Yes, I know. You're so brave. -Mom. -Yeah, it's okay. That's it. All right. It's okay. Shh. Arms up. Keep them up. Arms up. You're such a brace girl. You are. -Okay. -Mommy. Okay. - Mommy. - Help! Help, please! Help us. Please help. Please. Please help us. Please. Call the police. Please. Please, call the police. Michelle Estey? Yes. I'm Detective Ben Summers. I'm very sorry about what happened to you and your daughter. We're doing everything we can to find the people who did this. Are you Breea? Breea, I need to ask your mom a couple of questions. My friend Greg is gonna take you to his car for a little while so you can keep warm, okay? What? She'll just be over here with me, ma'am. We won't take long. I don't want you to take her. I know this is a very stressful time, but I need to get your statement. She may have seen or heard something that you didn't. We don't want anyone getting things confused. It's standard procedure, Miss Estey. I don't wanna go, Mom. Look, baby, we are safe now, okay? Just go with him. I'll be right here. She'll be all right. Now did you get a look at any of them? No. No, they were wearing masks. They never took them off? No. What else? We were up all night. It was horrible. I think they terrorized my little girl. This is the address of the motel we've set you up until we are through with your house. So you'd be putting us in protective custody? I don't see any reason to do that at this point. But you haven't got the man who did this to us. Until you do, our lives are in danger. I'm afraid they won't authorize a transfer to protective custody without a risk assessment. A risk assessment? We just spent the past 18 hours being terrorized. Those animals said they would kill us if we even talked to you. Think that's enough of a risk assessment? Miss Estey, I've worked cases like this for over 20 years. The guys that did this to you are long gone. They're not coming back. It's not what he said when he had a gun to my head. Okay, load her up! What are they doing to my car? Well, we're going to have to impound it for evidence. How am I gonna drive? I'll call a rental. Is there anyone you can call for help, Michelle? Her father? Any family you can call? All right. We're gonna need you to bring Breea down to the station tomorrow for her statement. I'll be in touch with the details. And if you think of anything else, my number is on the other side of that card. Fine. -Excuse me, officer. -Yes, ma'am. Are paramedics coming to check us for shock or trauma? I don't know, ma'am. My baby. All right, get in, jellybean. Where are we going? We're gonna go stay in a motel, okay? -Excuse me, officer. -Yeah. I'm gonna step inside and grab some stuff. Could you keep an eye on my daughter? No problem. Thanks. Mom, no, don't leave me alone. No, no, no, no. I don't want you to go back inside. I'm gonna go and I'm gonna grab some of our stuff. And you're gonna stay here. Yeah, I'll lock the door. And you see that police officer? He's gonna look after you, okay? I'm gonna lock the door. Okay? Please. Please don't. Excuse me. Breea? Baby. And there was another drive-by shooting today downtown, and it appears to be gang related. There are no suspects, yet the victim was taken away unconscious, but is expected to recover fully and should be able to help the police with information. The story of the UniNational Bank robbery we've been following has taken a new twist. We have confirmed the bank's own manager Michelle Estey... Hey, you're that person. Yeah, yeah, the lady from the bank. ...before nine o'clock this morning. Police are questioning Estey and her daughter, who claim to have been held hostage prior to the robbery... Just bring me up. ...she was then forced to rob her own bank. Back to you guys in the studio.- Good news... Here. Don't you want your change? Hey. You haven't done that since you were a baby. Can you talk to me? No? Why not? Because they'll hear me. Okay. Hey. That better? You hungry? I have your favorite cereal. Some yogurt. I'm not hungry. My tummy hurts. Okay, so why don't we get some fresh PJs, and wash your face, and brush your teeth, and then I'll tell you a bedtime story, okay? Okay. They did. No. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. You know what? I have an idea. But I'm gonna need your help and I'm gonna need some help from Bear. You guys think you can help me? Yeah? Okay. I'm gonna need a lot of that. Dave, something horrible has happened. We need you. Hey, what are you drawing? Michelle, it's me. Hey. There's my girl. Come here. How about Uncle Dave takes you out for a milkshake? Strawberry, your favorite? - Yeah. - Yeah. Thank you. I'm here as long as you need me. Both of you. Miss Estey. We've been questioning your staff and a few things have come up. If you don't mind? When did you say you met Chris Clark? I already told you. This will go a lot faster if you just answer the questions. I know it seems redundant, but I promise you, it all leads somewhere. Now, Chris Clark, when did you meet him? I don't know, um... Monday, the day before the attack. Is that when you discussed the plan to rob the bank with him? There was no discussion. He told me his plan when he was at my house. And you went along with the plan? Went along? Well, you agreed to steal money from your own bank. Why did you do that? I didn't have a choice. He had my daughter. We had dynamite attached to us... Well, you could have pushed the panic button and called the police. You walked in on your own, you took the money on your own. You had every opportunity to call for help. I had a microphone. He would have heard every word I said. Look, he had Breea. She had a bomb attached to her. There was... Miss Estey, there were no bombs. -What? -The dynamite was fake. No. No, no, no, it wasn't fake. It was heavy. I felt it and it was... It was a roll of nickels inside a painted wooden dowel. There was no microphone. No detonator. It was all fake. It was dark. I wouldn't even know what to look for. Wait, didn't you say they taped you up in the morning? It wasn't dark then. Why are you doing this to me? Why aren't you helping us? The only way I can help is by examining every detail. Why don't we get a cup of coffee and go sit in your office and you can tell me about who was on the walkie-talkie. I can't go back there. The way they were all watching me, they didn't know whether to stare or look away. Yeah, that, they're probably just in shock. They think I'm guilty. Even Rose couldn't look me in the eye. God. What am I gonna do, Dave? I mean, I can't go to work. I don't wanna go back home. You'll make it better. You always do. Remember when I was 13? You know, Dad had taken off after some fight, and Mom was a wreck. Troy was stealing everything inside, and I was just... trying to see how drunk I could get every day. You know, just total chaos at home. But then you sent me that Christmas card from LA, you wrote about parties and hanging out with rock stars. There's a lot more to the story than that. It's like you threw me a life saver. You showed me there was a way out. You're strong. You always have been. And you're gonna pull through this for Breea. I know you will. I don't understand why I can't be there with her. It's better if the parent isn't there. We don't want the kids to feel under any pressure. I'm her mother. I'm a therapist. I work with young victims. That's why I'm here. You need to find the guys that did this to us. That's what you need to do and not ask questions. Her answers will help us find them. Hi, Breea. How about you and I go and try to find some... some crafts and some other fun stuff to do? Would that'd be okay with you? Is that okay, baby? Come on, it'll be fun. They used a lacquer paint to make the fake bombs, the kind of paint you can pick up at any hardware store. But it doesn't dry so quick. So one of them left a fingerprint behind when he picked it up. We ran the print. Got a match. William Hastings, aka Raymond Hastings, aka Christopher Clark. I told you. This Chris Clark was convicted of eight bank robberies in Southern California. Sentenced to 15 years at Lompoc, served five. Have you found them? Not yet but we're close. Thank you. Still, there's something that's just not sitting right. I mean, here's this guy, this hardened criminal. He plots an elaborate bank robbery with a kidnapping and dynamite, a remote control, but before all that, he walks into the bank, shows his face, shakes your hand, introduces himself, leaves a business card with you. You see where I might be having a little trouble with this? I mean, you see where it just gets a little confusing. Yeah, I mean, it makes no sense. Now that is the truth. Doesn't make sense. You're a branch manager of one of the largest banks in Southern California, but you have less than a thousand dollars in savings. Is that right? I had difficulty putting money aside. I had some bills I'd to take care of. Quite a few, I'd say. Eight grand on one credit card, nine and change on another. My ex ran up a lot of debt before he left me. Why are you asking this? Two years ago you filed for bankruptcy. Chapter 7, is that right? Yes, that's correct. I had trouble making payments. How does my financial situation matter to all this? It matters because you walked out of the bank with over 300,000 dollars! It matters because your assistant Rose Jones told me the day before the robbery you were tired and acting unusual. That's why this matters. So... I have to ask you. Did you have anything to do with this crime? What? You think I'd let those monsters torture my little girl? What kind of person do you think I am? You might wanna get a lawyer. Hey, Mom. Look what I made. Wow. That's beautiful. She did very well. Could I talk with you for a minute? How are you doing? Fine, fine. Michelle. Michelle, I'm a doctor, I'm not a police officer. I don't know, I don't know. I mean, everything is such a mess. They are just trying to take Breea away from me. I just... I can't... I can't let her see me like this. I have to be strong. Victims of violent crimes, domestic abuse, war veterans, they oftentimes bury their pain because it's too much to deal with. It's the mind's way of protecting us. These are very normal reactions to abnormal situations. But if you don't deal with these feelings right away... You'll continue to relive the original experience over and over. Now, what you and Breea have gone through is going to take some time to heal. Now I want you call me. Please. If you feel that you need some help. Thank you. Bob Jason, a buddy of mine, he's an attorney. He'll be able to advise us. Why do I need an attorney? The... the cops jump up and down on innocent people all the time, Michelle. You need to know your rights. I'm up to my ears in debt here. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't afford one. I'm sure Bob will let us work something out. And I got some money I can help out with. No. No. I won't let you do that. I've done nothing wrong. Hello? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Breea, sweetie, can you put it on Channel 5? Police have just arrested three men in connection with last week's robbery of the UniNational Bank. Authorities have not released... Thanks, man. ...the names of the suspects, but it is believed they masterminded the kidnapping and robbery which netted over 360,000 dollars. Last week in Southern California, the branch manager, Michelle Estey, was allegedly held hostage with her daughter and forced to enter her own bank and... -It's over now, Mom? -I think so, sweetheart. Miss Estey has been questioned by the police and released. Today's arrest may lead to further details in this astonishing... You'll be okay. We will be following this case as it continues to develop. Now back to local news. The prosecution team led by assistant DA James Leland will take your testimony and then... What testimony? I've already told you everything like 20 times. I know, but he'll need to hear it all himself. And we're gonna wanna know more about your relationship with Chris Clark in light of a statement we have from his wife Sandi Clark. There's nothing more to add that I haven't already told you. I'm sorry, but it's necessary that you talk to us in person. St... I'll get straight to the point. Were you having an affair with Chris Clark? You're joking. Did you and Chris Clark plan to rob your own bank? This is ridiculous. Did you and Chris Clark work together in this crime? No. In her statement, Sandi Clark said that she's certain that you and her husband were romantically involved. And you believe her? Sh... She's delusional. She sat in a car outside of my house and radioed instructions while he tortured my child. Did you see her there? Did you see her there? Did you see her there? Because we have no evidence of Sandi Clark being involved in this crime at all. How dare you? How dare you believe her? She was a partner in this crime. She's a mother. She knew exactly what it was like inside there, and she didn't care. Let's just get back to the question of were you and Clark intimate. Yes or no? He threw me on the ground, sat on top of me and held a gun to my head. Is that intimate? We found these in Chris Clark's possession. You don't miss a trick, do you? Are you enjoying this, detective? Is this entertaining to you? I'm not in the entertainment business. That seems to be more of your field. Do strippers make a lot of money? They do if they're good. Was stripping what broke up your marriage? I quit two years before that, long before Breea came along. But everything I did was perfectly legal, right? I asked them to remove those photos off the website when I left. They refused. Now what else do you want from me? The truth. Clark lived in Oceanside, five minutes away from the bank. Now don't tell me that's just a coincidence. Obviously, it doesn't matter what I say. It would if I thought you were telling me the truth. You want the truth? I was a fifteen-year-old runaway who didn't think anybody gave a damn about her life. So, yeah, I made a few wrong decisions. But then I grew up. I moved on. I went to school. I worked my tail off to get a job so I could give my daughter a better life than what my parents gave to me. Breea doesn't know about this part of my life. And I would appreciate it if it stays that way. There's something else you should know. We recovered 200,000 dollars of the bank's money from Clark and the other suspects, but there's still 160,000 dollars missing. Now that kind of money would go a long way to paying off your debts. Now wouldn't it, Michelle? I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you not to leave town. We're gonna have further questions. Let's talk some more about your time growing up. I just need you to help me sleep. I hear their voices at night. I thought we were gonna talk about that. From what I'm hearing, you've been traumatized more than once. Drugs, alcohol, violence, neglect. Just a regular happy family. Welcome to my life. What's the best thing about it, your life? Breea. I mean... I promised... I promised I was going to protect her. She was gonna have a better life than me. She wasn't gonna have to be afraid all the time. It's not fair. This is not fair. It's not fair. It's not fair. I have spent every day trying to be free of my parents. I have busted my ass to get Breea a better life than me. I have done everything I could. Everything. Except forgive them. What? Anger is a strong chain. This is stupid. It can lock you to a... a reality that may no longer be accurate. No, it's accurate. It's accurate, all right? You don't know them, but it's accurate. I actually meant how you see yourself. Maybe you're worried that your daughter won't forgive you. No. No. No, I'm gonna take her far away from here and we're gonna be okay. You make it sound like you're going to run away. As far and as fast as we can. You know, Michelle, sometimes the thing that we wanna to run away from is inside of us. You can't outrun it. Watch me. Michelle, you told me that you wanted your daughter to have a different life than you. But running is what you've always done. You're giving her the same life. When you find the thing that scares you the most, run toward it. Miss Estey? I wanted to tell you in person we've recovered the rest of the money. It was in a safe house linked to Chris Clark. We see no reason to consider you a suspect any longer. So you're disappointed, detective? For what it's worth, I'm sorry if you felt we treated you harshly. Well, I'm strong. You know, every day I hear victims say "I just want it to be over." And I'm not sure it ever really is. You are strong. And I hope you can use that strength to move you and Breea on from this. I wish you both the best. I really do. First, we need to convict those guys. There are a lot of things that I regret. Michelle... Do you know how close I came doing it for money? This close. I don't care. You turned it all around and you made something of yourself. You know, last night I thought about grabbing Breea and hitting the road to someplace where I could give up, hoping to be someone different than who I was. Then it hit me, I think that's what happened to Mom. That maybe she just did the best she could for us and maybe she just had to give up hope that one day someone would hear her prayers for a better life. I'm not gonna run, Dave, if it kills me. Breea is gonna have a different kind of mom. You look pretty. Thank you. Are you going to work? No. Actually, I am going to the courthouse. I have to go make sure that those bad men go to jail and that they don't hurt anybody anymore. I'm proud of you, Mom. Thank you. Here, take that with you. You can keep me close if you get scared. Thank you. Miss Estey, do you recognize the man who broke into your home in the night of November 21st? Yes. That... that's him. Thank you, Miss Estey. That's all for now. You did very well. He was gonna try to intimidate you, but you don't let him. I don't know. You don't have to testify till next week, and because you're our witness, you can't be in the courtroom until you do anyway. So why don't you just go home and be with your family? Michelle, you're gonna be great. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, within these four walls you are gonna hear two very different stories about one particular incident. And one of them will be just that, a story, the truth twisted and the facts left out, a fictional story invented to cast a prejudicial light, a false light upon my client. So, please let me... Let me be very, very clear here. There was no kidnapping. The prosecution's main witness, the so-called victim, was never ever in any danger from my client. In fact, this bank manager orchestrated this entire crime, was having an affair with the defendant Christopher Clark and is responsible for the theft of 360,000 dollars. And those are the facts. And no pack of lies brought forth by the prosecution could change that. Michelle Estey is a criminal. He's lying. They are lies. This is all lies. Of course, they are. Everyone is going to read this. You just have to be strong, okay? Just hang on and fight back. Of course, it isn't true, but it's what happens. How can he do this? A trial isn't about truth, it's about gamesmanship. Gamesmanship. You gotta be kidding. This is my life we're talking about. Sometimes what happens in court isn't fair, but if it follows the law, it's admissible and the jury gets to hear it. The fact is we have such a strong case against Chris Clark that their only recourse is to attack you. That's the game he's playing. You know what? It stinks. It's called dirtying the victim. And it's only gonna get worse from here. Great. I met her at a club. You and Michelle Estey? Yeah. Yeah, she was real flirty. She kept shooting signals my way. I'm sorry, what do you mean by signals? Well, it was pretty clear what she wanted and then we became, well, you know, intimate sexually. And is that when you two discussed the bank robbery? Well, that's when she brought it up. I mean, the whole thing was her idea. She said all we had to do is just strap some fake dynamite to her, and then the people at the bank would have to do everything that she said. Yeah, I thought it was all talk, though. And why was that? Well, 'cause I just didn't believe that she was serious. But then she had us over to her house. She laid out the whole plan. I mean, she even had us ransack the place and she had us rough her up because she wanted the police to believe that it happened. So, you never spied on her? No, sir. You never kidnapped her? No, sir. You never held her hostage? Absolutely not. Come on, he's lying. Order. On the night of the so-called hostage taking, how much did you have in your ATM account? I don't know, I guess, um... About 714 dollars and 39 cents, to be exact. Does that sound about right? - I guess. - Yes or no, please? Yes. And how much in your savings account? Nothing. Stocks? Nothing. Retirement? Life insurance? Anything at all to your name? Objection. Let her answer the questions. I'm sorry. Please, let me rephrase. On the morning you walked freely into the UniNational Bank and opened up the vault with your private set of keys and ordered your employee to help you scoop 360,000 dollars into a bag, on that morning you had only some bogus tubes taped under your clothing and a convincing story of a night of terror... Not a story. ...that you yourself concocted... That's a lie. Because the sum total of your life's worth... He made me do it! ...exactly 714 dollars and 39 cents. -It's a lie! -That's true or false? 714.39. Please, just answer the question, Miss Estey. True. I don't think I could do this. I don't think I can go back in there. Michelle, you're not helping yourself. If you're hostile and argumentative, the jury isn't gonna be sympathetic to you. But it's clear that I'm the victim here. It's clear to you, to me. But the defense is presenting a pretty good story. You need to get a hold of your emotions. Answer clearly, yes or no. Ex-otic dancer. Exotic dancer. I mean, isn't that just a fancy name for prostitute? - No, sir. - Come on, Miss Estey. You're up there dancing naked in a room full of horny men. You mean to tell me you've never had sex for money? Yes, sir. Well, the defendant Christopher Clark was a client of yours, was he not? No, sir. He wasn't a client of yours, is that what you're saying? -Yes, sir. -I'm sorry I'm confused. "Yes, sir, he was a client" or "Yes, sir, he wasn't"? I never met Mr. Clark until he walked into the bank. Is that okay to say that? The jury will take that as a no. You close with your daughter, Miss Estey? Very. -She trusts you? -Yes. She'll do anything you ask her to do, wouldn't she? Yes. Except clean her room and make her bed. We're still working on this. Miss Estey, isn't it true you told your daughter that this whole home invasion idea of yours was just a game? What? Just another trip on an amusement park ride? No. Told her how much Mommy loved her and how the two of you were gonna take this ride together so that she'd go along with your insidious plan to rob the bank? How can you stand there and lie? I'm painfully aware that I'm not perfect, but I would never ever deliberately put my daughter in harm's way. She's the most gentle, the most amazing person that I have ever met. And I would rather die than to watch her go through what she went through. I hate this waiting. It's always the most tense when they're deliberating. Hopefully they'll have a verdict soon. I just wanna move on, get my life back. Whichever way this goes, you need to know you did your best in there. Be proud of that. Thank you. Yeah? They are back. The jury finds Christopher Clark -guilty of conspiracy... -Yes! ...to commit kidnapping for robbery, guilty of kidnapping for ransom, guilty of first-degree robbery. Thank you. Good job, buddy. Good job. -How is your ice cream? -Great. Breea, if you will say anything to those men, the bad men, what would you say? They scare me. I know, baby. They'll never hurt us ever again. I would tell them... I hope they get better in their hearts. Excuse me. Your Honor, we all know that he's been found guilty. Is what she has to say really even relevant? I mean, couldn't we get on with the sentencing? It's her right to deliver a personal statement about how this crime has impacted her life and her child's. Now, sit down. Everything I have to say here today is relevant, Mr. Martinez. I had thought I wanted to use this chance today to hurt you, to find words sharp and brutal enough to torment you, like you did to us that awful night, words that would haunt you for the rest of your life. But my little girl showed me a different road. We're all born as innocents into this world. None of us has the power to control the forces that blow by blow chip and dent and strip our innocence away from us. But we were all born with the power of choice. How we fill those cracks and dents is up to us. Disappointment can fuel a life of anger and malice. And if we sink low enough, we can become blind to the pain we're inflicting on others. Or we can choose to take another road, and no matter the brutality we meet or our dark nights of despair, we can choose to listen to a different guide. This is the road to forgiveness. Where are we, Mom? It's a surprise. Hi, Mom. Hi, Michelle. This is Breea. Breea, this is your grandmother. Hi, Grandma. Hello, Breea. Why are we standing outside? Come on.
