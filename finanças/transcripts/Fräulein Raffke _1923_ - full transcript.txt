I could also throw in the portraits of my ancestors and the suits of armour. One of my most famous ancestors: Sigismund the terrible. I am... Raffke the good-natured. So, mother... should we buy the little place? A few weeks later... This house already belongs to me, Baron. I have bought up the mortgage and all the other debts. Nevertheless I'll pay you a little something extra. It's outrageous how you neglect me... I simply won't allow it! You have an ardent admirer... Baron Geldern. Jealous? No money, Mr. Raffke!

I will never marry that person, dad! End of the Act One. Act Two. They want to force me to marry Baron Geldern. There is nothing left for me to do but withdraw. If you don't marry me, tomorrow I'll disappear and no one will ever see me again. But where do you want to take me? To the pastor... where we can be married Shortly after... Mr. Raffke is giving a house warming party at his castle. I mustn't miss it. But Tatiana, I have such a pressing invitation from the Raffkes that I just can't say no.

My dear guests, I have not only invited you to this house warming but also to be witness to a joyous surprise. My beloved daughter and Baron Geldern... Mr. Raffke, your daughter is my wife! Out! Get out of here! End of Part Two. Part Three. One year later... Charles Bauer, Paul's partner... Max Gr?nberg. I hope that in six months time I can repay all the money you have put into my business. Someone has difficulty sleeping... I've just got engaged to Paul. I ask you once more, dear mom, come and see your grandson. My only wish is that everything between us should be as it was before... Paul doesn't know that I gave him the money for his business. Now I want to see what he's doing with it. Bring my child back with you. Put on your best clothes and we'll go out... it'll clear your mind. The dance hall. My daughter can still drink champagne! Quiet! Show him the door, the black marketeer! Ask Paul Gruhne for the money you gave him for his business. But then, Mr. Raffke, he will be ruined. I don't need your advice. Do what I say. End of Act Three. Act Four. After three years of hardships... Nerves, my dear fellow, nerves. Absolute rest... No work and lots to eat. Also malnourished. Pluck up your courage. Go and see your father. It's about time. Never! You know I'm your friend. I will do anything to help you. Would you let your husband and child die out of senseless pride? Do not accept it as a gift. The money from this check can be repaid by your husband when he has recovered. With with one condition: this check must be guaranteed by your father. It's up to you how you obtain his signature. One hour later. Is this what he's brought you to, the miserable wretch? Nerves! And what else... So long as you're with him you won't get a penny out of me. You can come live here with your child. Mommy, I'm hungry. Naturally, your father's signature is enough for any sum. Believe me, your son-in-law is seriously ill. And if you do nothing to help, then... I repeat, I will give nothing until my daughter has left her husband! Take this to my children. Here, this should take care of you for quite a while. Forger! I won't accept this money. Then your wife and your child can only be helped if... If you... let her go... Daddy has gone. I cannot longer be a burden to you. Your mother's money will help out until I can get ahead. After a long search... I will never forget this! End of Act Four. Act Five. Be careful... you go too far. Lilli's birthday. You wife? Since you left she's been living with her parents. I will never set foot in that house, Lilli! For months I've been at a friend's house, sick in bed. But I've written to you every day... Now I have a good job I can offer you and our child a good home. You should never have left me, Paul. I still love you, but I have lost all faith and confidence. To celebrate Lilli's birthday, Raffke organizes a party. You cry because dad isn't here, right mom? Why do you always look at other people's legs? What about mine! Come on, Harras. We're going to look for dad. End of Act Five. Act Six. Raffke the First. I want my daddy. I have a birthday present for you. How could you be so foolish... You see what poverty drives one to. Are you spying on me? We've searched for you everywhere, Tatiana. Let's dance. Dear Lilly, our child was brought to me, completely soaked. He is feverish and asks for you. Paul. Should I shout it from the rooftops that you're an imposter? Let me out! Everyone will know what you are... I did it because I loved him. I helped him when he was down and out and depraved. I have made him human again. Your money took him from me... Dear Lilly... Our child was brought to me completely soaked, he is feverish and asks for you. Your money has already caused enough damage, Mr. Raffke? Sick... the child is sick... There is no danger, Lilli. The child will stay here with us. Mother, here we started, living modestly and humbly. And how happy we were... Subtitles: corvusalbus, Euard48.
