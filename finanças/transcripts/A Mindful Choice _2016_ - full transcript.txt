>> I remember one day realizing something that shocked me. I would wake up in the morning,and I'd have quiet time before I went to work. And I'd be drinking coffee and reading the newspaper, and I wasn't there. Where was I? I was at work. I was in fictitious meetings that, by the way, never happened. And my boss would ask me a question, and I'd come up with a brilliant answer. And I would play this out in my mind, because I was thinking about the past and the future. And I realized the vast majority of my day, my body would be right here,my life would be right here, and I was here, or I was here. It was like a light bulb went on. [music playing] In some part of your lifetime,there's a point where you say, there has to be more to life than what I'm experiencing here. And that's the very moment you start to look for more. The reason you're in this body is to experience that ongoing-- that underlying reality of everything you. Not to think about it, not to read about it, but to actually move into a direct experience of it. It's the same thing with peace and stillness. Taste it, experience it, stop grinding and thinking on it. You can think about it, think about it, think about it, and then you're going to die. Or you can say, how do I bathe in peace and absolute pristine stillness forever. How do I do that? And how do I do it soon? That's your choice. [music playing] >> It wasn't far from here, actually, quite a few years ago that I was skiing with a bunch of mates back country. It was a beautiful day. We were skiing down a slope. It was just the "serendest" explosion. We got caught in an avalanche,and next thing, I'm under. The surprising thing was that when I went under, I just had this overwhelming sense of peace. I was aware that I was under the snow, that I was trapped. I couldn't breathe. My legs couldn't move. My arms couldn't move. But there was absolutely no panic. It was like this awareness of this endless ocean of peace and stillness. God knows how long I was in there for, but at some point, I was thrust out, as if I was on the leading edge of this avalanche. And it was then that the panic kicked in, because I was just trying to suck as much oxygen in as I could, you know? The fear that I'd go back and the possibility that I could die just-- that really cranked up the panic. And I went back under. And after a short time, I was thrust out again. And the avalanche come to an abrupt halt. When I got out, fortunately,everyone else was out as well. When we regrouped, I thought, man, you know, that was an amazing experience of extended silence and peace. If I could experience that under the snow, surely I could have it in my day to day life. Then I thought, the only way, I think, practically I can even do this is to make a lot of money, make it quickly, retire early, and head to a beach. I made a choice. So I did. I cranked it up. I was already in business, but I moved it up to the next level. But what I actually found was that I was moving further away from what I was after. I started to experience more worry, more stress, more frustration. I developed a habit of insomnia at night. I looked in the mirror and just was like, mate, what are you doing. You look so unhappy. And I thought, I've got to change this. I've got to change my paradigm, if you like. But life just kept throwing big things at me. My wife and I separated. Not that much later, I was diagnosed with a tumour inside my head that required six weeks of radiotherapy. And there was just an ongoing series of events, as if they were trying to wake me up. Sort of get on with it, get on with the job. [music playing] >> I was 15. Up until that moment, I didn't know that another kind of life or another kind of reality existed, because I was coming from a beautiful love bubble. My dad, my friends-- I mean, it was beautiful. I was just about to go to high school with some friends that stayed overnight in my house. A few guys with guns came into my house and tried to kidnap me. I was able to run away and I was able to hide from the kidnappers. And in the middle of that,my dad, also the gardener, and my grandfather tried to defend me. There was shooting and, of course, killing. I was able to see everything from the distance and from the window. And I just heard like in the background a truck like spinning the wheel,like [makes noise], you know? So I just ran back to the place that all the fighting was happening. I saw the gardener gone. It was an impactful experience when you see that the body is there,but there's no one there. And then I saw my dad in the stairs still moving. He was still alive. But he was unable to talk, because the bullets went through those lungs. When I look into his eyes-- well, that was one of the most amazing experience I ever had. He just-- so much depth, wisdom,love, service, giving, purpose. It was strange in the middle of so much darkness. It was like he was telling me a lot of things through the eyes. It was like a mental connection. I could hear everything, like-- everything. And then, suddenly he died in my arm. The feeling of purpose, the feeling of destiny, the feeling of love, the feeling of consciousness, really-- I mean, that was even a million times stronger than the experience of death. That was more shocking,because I was like, how come-- how come I can see this potential love, or destiny, or divine destiny, actually-- like I just put that word-- the divine destiny be stronger than the passing away of a loved one. And that just stuck me in my head all my life. It's like, what's that. >> There's a place within us--this still, silent place-- which never comes and goes. It's permanent. And you can call that god,you can call that light, you can call that truth, you can call it the underlying reality of everything. But there's one thing that exists. And to move into that as an experience from a concept, you need to dissolve a sense of an individual intelligence, an individual me, through just bathing in this sea of silence that's within us. The sea of peace and the sea of silence, it's been there forever. Some of us know it or have known it as a child. We've been able to touch that place, and it felt like home. It's always been. And in fact, it's the only thing in our existence that's always been there. [music playing] It was the late '80s, start of the '90s. And it was the big upsurge of the ecstasy nation in the UK. There was raves everywhere. It was the generation thing to do. Almost everybody was into it. Yeah. Using the drugs, the partying, the whole experience of that time in my life was giving everybody this sense of connection. Everybody seemed to drop all of their judgments, all of their differences. It was amazing. It was so much different to being just drunk. The whole movement, the whole generation, was just into dancing and just loving each other. It went kind of off the rails, you could say. I ended up getting into a lot of trouble with the law and looking at a rather large prison sentence. My dad came to see me while I was on remand. He said, are you due to get out. And I said, no. And he said, good. He said, it's the best place you could be. He was absolutely-- he was over the moon that as bad as it could have looked for me, I wasn't going to die. The wake up call for me from that way of life was when I was about 25, I'd had a son. And so I decided that that way of life wasn't going to work, because I understood the responsibilities of raising a child. I quit everything, and I decided to work full time and get back into a normal life, as far as what I could remember one was. But it never really seemed enough for me. It felt like a poor excuse for being very happy. I decided that I really needed to experience that fullness, that connectedness, that same experience. But I knew I couldn't do it through drugs. So I looked into the success of rehabilitation and therapy. And it turned out that the rehabilitation unit I was in had been going for like 10 years. And the success rate was 2% of all the people who came through. What I found amazing was the statistics the people who don't bother going through rehabilitation-- for them who do it are 2%. What became really apparent was that the change only happens at the point when you are sick enough of the behaviour that you're doing which is causing you the problems. I didn't know how I was going to do it, but that choice in and of itself made so many other things available to me. It just immediately changed my whole take on my whole life. [music playing] Got a good woman for my soul, got whiskey for my sin. Pray I got both when I leave this bar in a car or a coffin. And I'll ride this road 'til it takes me home. Or I'll ride this dirty road 'til I die. >> In Mexico, teachers like"modavi" are introducing a new phase of rehabilitation teaching ascension in prisons to those who are ready to embrace change. [music playing] There ain't one way to sing a song. >> And the cool thing is that 25% of the people in this facility, which houses just under 2,000 prisoners, meditate. >> It's something that's not been done very often around the world. So we appreciate your openness to introduce this program into the prison. [music playing] My feet are worn, my lungs are hard, and my heart's as cold as steel. >> After my dad died, started drinking, drugs all day, every day, for months, and months, and years non-stop. And I was looking for the experience I experienced when my dad died. And nothing gave me that-- nothing. So I would just keep on looking. Where is that? Where is that? Where is that? And I remember once I was in my house, alone in my father's bedroom. And I remember just crying. I couldn't handle it any more. A friend of my called me, and she's like, Maghava, there's some meditation course this weekend. Why don't you come with us? And I'm like, OK, I'll go. There's nothing to lose. When I arrived, I saw the teachers. And their presence-- they had something that I never experienced before. Suddenly, they started to explain the meditation-- [inaudible] And I'm like, what's this. And my heart's just like [makes beating noise].. And soon as they started to explain the game, everything started to become really clear within myself. I just knew that I found what I was looking for. Immediately I started to experience clear silence, awareness. As soon as I started to play with what the teachers were telling me, I knew I needed to actually let go of the seeking. I actually needed to let goof that idea of searching. That's worth everything. There's a lot of ideas about spiritual journeys or meditation. One is like, let's put the mind in black or have no thoughts-- have no emotion. And that's not true. We are not going against what the natural flows of life are. There are emotions. Of course there is emotions. But I'm not "calling" them. I don't make a story around them. I don't make them personal. I just watch them back. The same as thoughts. They don't take all my attention. They are just part of the whole experience. Then, of course, if I live like that, automatically there's peace-- automatically. [music playing] >> I remember when I first learned to meditate, the realization of what I'd been doing-- I was quite shocked, because, actually, the point at which I learned to meditate, I was grinding my teeth--breaking teeth at night. I never woke up feeling refreshed. I was exhausted. Two relatively young children, trying to be the perfect mother,the perfect housewife, the perfect neighbour, the perfect teacher, the perfect everything, you know? And I used to describe the experience as meeting myself coming back. You know, going round in ever decreasing circles. I was exhausted. Once I heard the explanation and the background for what meditation is-- because, really, this is the area that meditation addresses. We're living all the time in the past. I recognized how many times I rehashed conversations with people to try and get it right. It's like madness, isn't it? For the last 12, 13 years, I've had cancer. It started as breast cancer. Now I've had treatment. It's slowly developed. And I now have secondaries in the liver and in my spine. And yet, thanks very much to the meditation skills that I've learned, just being able to accept everything-- even something as extreme and challenging as that-- has enabled me just to be fully present now and back to this moment again and again. Really, it's a very simple thing, meditation. It just allows you to live open and allowing in this moment. That has been absolutely key to my being able to live joyfully and peacefully no matter what's happening to the body. You know, my body's going to do what it's going to do. I can take a lot of actions, a lot of strategies to assist it. But ultimately, I'm not in control. And a lot of what we call stress is because we think we're in control, and we think we know what's going to happen, and it doesn't. And we find that distressing,or frustrating, or annoying, or painful, or whatever,because we're resisting what is. [music playing] The judgment day shall come. >> Slowly but surely I was starting to experience a bit of respite from the stress. I worked less. I actually developed a new relationship. And I found I recreated the same dynamic I had in my marriage, where I was just so judgmental the relationship failed. And I was overwhelmed with a sense of loss, you know? Bitching and moaning all the way through it. But once she's gone, the whiny voice in my head couldn't deal with it. I got to see that I need some way to let go of that judgment and let people be who they are, rather than me trying to control or want them to be something different. That was the major catalyst for me to commit to myself 100%-- just to go for that piece,go for their internal love. I had to establish that before I was able to get close to having a relationship again. >> I was stressed. I always seemed to be in this fight or flight mode, looking for the next thing to go wrong, trying to control everything in my life. And I didn't want to do it any more. But I didn't know what to do, really. The great thing, too,about going out with Greg was that that showed me how dysfunctional I was in a relationship. And I wanted that to change. Like, I did. I saw that I was very close to love. I was very afraid of love. I suppose my little subconscious mantra was that love hurts. Don't let someone get too close to you, because you might lose them or it'll just hurt if they reject you. And I got to understand that that came from my brother dying when I was 9 or 10 years old. And that one minute, I'm this happy kid who's living in a kind of a fantasy world, still feeling that connection to everything, and then suddenly, it was like life was turned upside down. Like, whoa, your life isn't safe. [music playing] >> If, for example, you could think about real wonderful moment in your life, do you remember it? Do you remember how little self-absorption there was in that moment? Do you remember how perfectly it unfolded? That even in retrospect, everything played out in the most wonderful moment in the most miraculous kind of way. That there was nothing about the moment we would change. It was ideal. We very often weren't even responsible for the moment. We were just able to experience the moment. We were present for the unfoldment of that moment. And do you remember how alive that moment was? How alive you felt in that moment? And I will suggest to you that moment was the most alive moment of your life. And I will say to you, with the exception of the intensity of your most wonderful moment, you're meant to live that kind of life-- that alive, with just an absolute sense of wonder and awe. That is your right to live that kind of life continuously. And we don't. We just forgot. [music playing] >> Every weekend, we hear this sort of crazy variety from American dance band, to rock and roll, to mariachi. I was a seeker from the time I was a young girl-- very young. I learned how to meditate when I was in college and really had my first tastes of stillness-- had my first taste of the voices quieting down. And of course, once that happens, you want more. And the way most of us got more during that era was to smoke, or take psychedelics, or anything that we could do to duplicate that experience. Occasionally, I felt like I got lucky. It was grace. But in terms of having that stillness permeate my life, that wasn't happening. I knew it was there, but it always seemed just out of reach. We came to San Miguel,and I couldn't believe it. I was given a tool that allowed me to sustain that state with no drugs. And it happened very, very quickly, which was the unexpected part. You know, I thought I was going to kind of get back into the drudgery of meditation and have some support to do that. But all of a sudden, it was accessible. And the thing that really was different with this particular practice was that it was something that I could do with my eyes open as well as my eyes closed. It had a huge effect on me creatively, because it was hit and miss when I was working, when I was writing. Sometimes I'd be listening to the voices in my head, which is never a good thing to do. The voices in my head-- I don't think the voices in any of our heads are ever saying kind things. They're always saying really mean things. I once said to somebody, if I sat in a restaurant next to a couple who were talking to each other the way my mind talks to me, I would get up and leave the restaurant. When you're creating, you want to be in that flow. That's the whole goal. That's why you do it, because that's the rush. That's the fun. But the minute those voices start, they just pull you out. So all of a sudden, here I was. I had a tool that allowed me to return to that flow so that I could look at the page after I'd been working and go, wow. Where did that come from? What a surprise. That is so amazing. And know with every inch of my being that I didn't do it. And that is-- that's gold. That is just gold. The practice allowed me to return to the state, which is only presence. I mean, it's not what I thought, especially after so many years of belief practice on top of belief on top of belief. I was waiting for Thus Spake Zarathustra. I was waiting for John Philip Sousa and fireworks in the sky. And it wasn't about that. It was just about being so fully present that I was here. It changed everything. It had a huge effect on every aspect of my life. [music playing] >> He says, watch your back. You'll get lost out there. There's a million ways to go. And we don't know our way back home. >> I've definitely seen a core belief that relates to addiction. And it is definitely being the core belief that I am not good enough. [music playing] >> --alone. And we don't know our way back home. >> The differences in my life now are just-- they're just amazing. And it's funny, because I don't feel that far away from who I actually was. I just feel the only problem there ever was was that non-acceptance that I am not good enough. And yet, to step out and make the decision to go and actually make the new choice and to gain some awareness on who you are, why you are, what you are is priceless. My son is 20 now. And yeah, he's an amazing guy. We have an amazing relationship. We're just the best of friends. He's had choices to go out with his friends, he's had choices to take drugs, he's had choices to do all the things that all kids do. And I've never taken any of those choices away from him. So his general state of natural peace has never really been questioned. And so yeah, he makes good choices. We have a very cool relationship. Yeah. [music playing] >> And he says watch your back,you'll get lost out there. There's a million ways to go. And we don't know our way back home. Cool. >> Another very key thing,particularly with critical life diagnoses, is that you face your mortality, maybe for the first time. It does become very obvious that our well-being is created very much by what we put our attention on and that we have choice. It's empowering. It's exciting. And I can choose what I put my attention on. And that's not about denial. I will do what my body says it needs. That may be going to bed. It may be going to have a massage. It may be going back to the consultant. I mean, who knows, you know? It's not about denial. But it's about knowing that there's so much more. What's going to happen is going to happen. And there's a ease and a fluidity with just accepting everything. Once you recognize that you want something more, it comes. It just comes. I really do believe that. >> An authentic path, of which there are very, very few in the world, are those that lead, ultimately, to oneness, to an unbroken awareness of silence, which is the gateway to enlightenment-- the gateway to freedom. I was one of those guys who said, I don't have time to heal me. You know, there's a world that's in a dilemma here. Let's get on with helping others. Let's heal the world. And unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. You know, you have to do the inner work yourself. And it basically comes down to two paths. One path is a path of comfort. And it's the path that most humans are on. And it's a path that, if you're looking at a mountain and climbing to the top of the mountain to experience oneness, it's a windy path up this mountain. And it just keeps going, and going, and going. It's not that it's a bad path. It's just a very long path. There's another path. And it's like walking straight up the side of Mount Everest. And it's the path-- it's called the path of the sages in some traditions. It's also known as the path of heroes. It's the path that says, I'm willing to do whatever it takes to wake up. I'm willing to do whatever it takes. Let's do it. Let's bring it on. I want to experience everything. I want to experience wholeness, completeness. The path of comfort, ironically,it's not a comfortable path. It is the funniest thing. It's called the path of comfort,not because it's comfortable, because most of humanity's on it, and they're not comfortable. It's called the path of comfort because the decisions we make on that path are decisions that we're comfortable with. They don't push us. They don't stretch us. And so it's a comfortable path, but there's no growth in that path. That's why the growth is so slow. There's a point where you say, there has to be more to life than what I'm experiencing here. And that's the very moment that you're very blessed, because you start to look for more. And when you do, very quickly if you have passion towards that, you start to move towards the path of heroes. Amazing. Thanks. >> I had the opportunity to teach-- I don't know-- 200 prisoners. And the first thing that came out of my mouth was, what will you even listen to "on" a 22-year-old? And everybody was like, yeah, actually. Why? And the first thing that came to my mouth was, probably, because one of the person that actually tried to kidnap and killed my dad probably is-- might be sitting here in this room. And everybody just like-- not easy. And they pay attention. And I share with them what I went through, what have I discover, and why am I doing what I'm doing right now to help people to find peace, no matter the background. When I think about my dad and that experience, the greatest gift that experience gave me was to look for something that would give me peace. And probably now I feel my dad closer than when I was a kid and I was unconscious. It's tricky to say, because I don't experience my dad as a human being with a body, with a mind, with a personality. I experience my dad everywhere all the time, as love, as presence. In many, many locations. >> As improbable as it was that I was going to find peace, I was in a cafe, and there was a brochure on the wall that was promoting a meditation course. And the brochure said, ascension as taught by the Ishayas of the bright path. And I thought, mate, what the hell is this, you know? It's wacky. But what they were saying resonated with me. It resonated with me with the experience I had had in the avalanche. And it also-- it resonated with me, which-- that I realized I needed to find that peace and love within me. The first thing they asked was, what's the one thing you want more than absolutely anything in life. No one had ever asked me that question, but it was obvious. I wanted peace. I wanted unbroken peace. I wanted to experience love-- love within myself and the ability to love someone else unconditionally. And I wanted to be happy. Not just moments of happiness,but I wanted it all the time. And the surprising thing for me was that all the other participants wanted exactly the same thing. The beautiful thing was that all the negative aspects of my life fell away. I was sleeping much better. My frustration and my stress fell away very quickly. And I was able to use these techniques with my eyes open. I'd been given a tool that allowed me to disengage the chatter in my head and reveal peace. And I knew that I was onto the right thing. >> Greg suggested I learn some meditation techniques. Meditation wasn't something I did. I thought it was for hippies and not for me. And I thought, well, I have--there's nothing to lose. I might as well go along and see what this is about. What I found was that I'd been looking for all those wonderful things in life in the wrong places. You know, the person I'm with should make me happy. My job should make me happy. You know, I didn't take any ownership for my own happiness. And once I started to do that and use these techniques to rest inward, that's where I found that it started to reveal the real me. You know, and the real me was happy, was joyous, was free to live fully. The purpose of us making this documentary is to show people that peace is possible and very much to show them that it's a personal choice. If peace is possible for the individual, then we want to show that it is possible for a group. And if that's possible, then it could be possible for countries. It could be possible for humanity as a whole. >> There are two institutions in town. We started about 20 years ago with the idea of provide boys between the age six, seven to 21, 22 years old a possibility of becoming somebody in life-- to provide them with a future. They have families, of course--all of them or most of them. But in all cases, they have either a father in jail, they have a mother with prostitution problems, with addiction problems, you name it. And the idea is instead of having these kids in the streets,to provide them with a home-- a place for them to stay, a place where they can be safe, where they can attend school, to give this kids a chance of being somebody in the future. >> Thank you for the welcome that you gave us. >> And the wonderful shirts, we love them. >> So it's good we've got three tables, because we have three balls. Can you find New Zealand? >> It's the other side of the world. >> Since we start meditating with the kids, the violence has been reduced. They also have different ways to fix their problems. They are more in peace. We can feel it. So we have a different way to talk, a different way to play, a different way to do all the things we do here in every moment. >> All the people who comes here tells me, here we can feel peace. We can feel happiness. And that's the most beautiful thing I have received from meditation. We want to give them all the opportunities to be empowered with love, with compassion. This will make a change in their lives. And that's the great power they will have, because nobody can take it from them. >> It's been a really powerful and uplifting day for us. Got to meditate with 200 inmates. It's more people than I've ever meditated with. And the stillness and the peace in that facility was palpable as a consequence. [music playing] >> The fascinating thing is that everyone on the planet wants exactly the same thing. We all want to experience unbroken peace, inner peace, contentment, and happiness, yet we seldom make it a priority. And I say to people who are not interested in learning to meditate, just spend more time doing what you love doing, because the things we love doing reveal peace and contentment. All that's required is to make a choice. [music playing]
