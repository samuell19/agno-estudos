Spread out Catch! Chief. Who are you? Go! Open. Win! Win! Three. One, two and four have lost. One, two, three. Don't miss this. but you might regret if you bet. Hurry up, place your bets. Bless me... Place your bets. Four five six. One...one... Six...six... I won! Wow, triple Six! Your tip. Thank you. Go... Everyone leaves this room except Qiao Yiduo. Chief Fang, let's talk this out. Fang Changfeng, you know I really hate to be interrupted in my gambling? Let us have a bet. I'm honored for the chance to gamble with Chief Fang from one of the Four Big families. Not this. Not this? As long as it's a bet. I bet that you can't locate Lei Xun in three days. Lei Xun? The wanderer? That's right. Him? Not a chance in this bet. Listen everyone, gambling addict Qiao Yiduo refuses to bet; What a joke! Fine! I'm in. The wager? One thousand taels of gold. If I lose, I'll chop off my head. Deal! Pay up. Pay up? Why? Chief Fang. You lost, Lei Xun is in the room. Get out here, Lei Xun! A certain Mr. Fang is giving out money. Fang? Fang Changfeng? Lei Xun, what is Qiao Yiduo going on about? Nothing, eat up. Lei Xun... Qiao Yiduo. Ye Qinghua, where's Lei Xun? How do I know? Don't be so arrogant. Chief. Ye Qinghua... Qiao Yiduo, stop playing games. Come out now! If you run off, I will never collect the thousand taels of gold from Fang Changfeng. Are you coming or not? No. If you don't go to Tianfeng Mansion with me, even Fang Changfeng lost the bet, he wouldn't be convinced. But it looks like you don't have a choice, come on. Lei Xun, you know that Fang Changfeng is looking for you? I know. You do? What's the emergency? Tiger, Wind, Cloud, Dragon are the Four Big Families. You know what happened to the Golden Tiger... ...Armed Escorts last month? I spent the whole time at Good Luck Gambling House, I had no idea at all... what the hell's going on! The Golden Tiger Family was on a job. Over twenty people including the Chief were killed last month. Really? Killed by whom? I have no idea. I think Fang Changfeng fears that he's next, that's why he's soliciting your help. And because of that, I don't want to get involved. Say no more, come with me to collect the money. If he's dead, then I won't get a thing. Fang Changfeng... Still alive, thank god! Chief Fang... Don't die just yet. Lei Xun is here, give me my money. Chief Fang. It's over. It's all your fault. If you had told me earlier that it's his turn, then I would at least get my gold. What's that got to do with me? It has everything to do with you. Which clan are they from? Shaolin Jingang Palm? Master Lei, Master Qiao, you two are well-informed, I'm sure you know who's weapon this gold knife is. Chief Lu, why ask us when you already know. You're a respected figure in the martial arts world, and the Chief of Baiyun (Cloud) Clan. I'm sure you'd know the owner of this gold knife. What a joke. Of course I know. I just want to double check with you two. Ye Qinghua family's signature weapon since generations. I heard that the witch Ye Qinghua has a special relationship with Master Lei. Ye Qinghua isn't a witch, and there's nothing going on between us. We're mere acquaintances. Last time it was Golden Tiger Clan, this time it's Tianfeng (Wind) Clan. Master Lu, I bet that your Baiyun (Cloud) Clan is going to be next. Stop. Chief Lu, we don't want to fight you. I've invited Chief Long Tianji of Heilong (Dragon) Clan here to discuss how to find the killer. Lei Xun, could you be helping the killer? You know who's the killer? Ye Qinghua. If it was her, she wouldn't leave her signature weapon here. Check out how the people of Tianfeng Clan were killed. Chief Lu, do you recognize this? Shaolin Jingang Palm. Nonsense. Shaolin kung fu styles are taught only in the temple, there's no way the Shaolin Temple is responsible. Can you be sure that Shaolin monks won't kill? That's why you blame Ye Qinghua for everything, right? Her weapon is here, she is the main suspect. Let's go. Stop. Lei Xun, the killer is now a public enemy. Careful or else you'd lose your standing and reputation Let's go. If we know who the killer is, she won't be going anywhere. Bury the bodies. Yes, Chief. One, two, three. Four, five, six. Four, five, six. Is the snake broth ready? Coming... Inside please. Come on. Qiao Yiduo, couldn't you take a break? You eat first, don't wait for me. Four, five, six. Could you stop gambling for a while? I'm winning. Why isn't Ye Qinghua here? Yes, it's time for food, she should know. Could something have happened? Do you think she's gone to find Fang Changfeng, to claim back the knife? The knife? Twenty years back I suggested that... even if we killed the Six Demons of Guandong, we should have got rid of their children. If only you had listened, the murders wouldn't have taken place. Brother Long, you're saying this in rage. We're men of righteousness, we couldn't just kill innocent women and children. As long as we find the Witch's daughter Ye Qinghua, then we could settle Fang Changfeng's death. We were going to look for you. What for? Return my gold knife to me. You killed Fang Changfeng. Don't think you'll walk out alive. Fang Changfeng is dead? You couldn't find a murderer and accused me? Kill her. Come on. Sniping attack, that's low. Let me get rid of you, witch. Move over. Hurry. Not waiting for me? Why didn't you kill them for me? I couldn't kill them before I find out the truth. Where are you going? None of your business. You better stay put, they consider you a suspect. You're safe with Qiao Yiduo. Can't I just follow you? Why do you have all these excuses to avoid me? Where do you want to go? To get my answers from Shaolin Temple. See if you dare to break the rules again. Master Kongxing. Listen up, you four. Make sure they've another 2 hours to go before I return, got it? Yes, Master. Master Lei, how well do you know Shaolin kung fu? Not a bit. Then how can you be sure that it's Shaolin kung fu? Master, palm on the chest, all the bones are broken, what kind of style is that? Amitabha Buddha. Our Jingang Palm has that power. Kongtong Clan's "Bone Breaking Palm", Changbai Clan's "Spirit Palm", and Shantong Clan's "Big Strike Palm" can do similar damage Master Kongxing is the Head of the Hall of Discipline, he's good at the martial arts styles of different clans Abbot, all the victims were dead from Shaolin's Jingang Palm. Nonsense, leave Shaolin Temple right now. Master Lei, we have always had a good reputation, our monks strictly observe the rules. We never get involved in the martial arts world. I don't think we have anything to do with the killings you mentioned. Amitabha Buddha. Please head back. You have so many monks here. Could you guarantee that there are no black sheep among you? Shaolin Temple will win by outnumbering me? How dare you insult Shaolin? I must teach you a lesson. Although this young master is talking nonsense, Brother Kongxing doesn't have to be so angry. Our Buddha has the Lion's roar, you can't blame him. Don't move. Excuse me. Tai Chi Single Whip? You're of the Tai Chi Clan? The third generation. Master, if I get kicked out easily, wouldn't I be a joke in the martial arts world? Master Lei, you suspect us, but do you have any proof? Alright, I'll be back when I've got the proof. Goodbye. That's ridiculous. Master Lei has left, but he has a point. But different clans do have similarities, so what? The fact is, Jingang Palm is a unique style of Shaolin. Are you saying that we have black sheep among us? You don't know what others are up to. Why is Brother Kongxing acting so strange? Amitabha Buddha. This is great. You're so smart. Even if Chief Lu wrecks his brain, he wouldn't expect us hiding inside the treasure attic. When Lei Xun returns, just do as I told. If your method won't work, watch out for your brain. My brain? Lei Xun likes to travel alone. Every time you see him, it's as if you're haunting him! Wouldn't that scare him off? Next time you see him, give him mixed signals. I guarantee your success. Chief, I've found that Lei Xun went to Shaolin Temple. That's just a diversion. If we find Ye Qinghua, we can locate the surviving supporters of the Six Demons of Guandong. What are you doing hiding up here? Didn't I tell you to guard this place well? Where are the others? Monk? Qiao Yiduo, what's going on? I'll take a look. Go. Are you alright, Chief Lu? Chief Lu, Lei Xun requests to see you. Request your ass! Come on in. Are you alright, Chief Lu? Leave. The murderers were monks! Monks? How many? Four. They robbed from the treasure attic. I saw everything hiding behind the cabinet. You saw them? I could identify them no matter what. Chief Lu... Chief Lu... Let's go to Shaolin Temple! Sure. Master Lei, this is ridiculous. Abbot, I said that I'd be back with proof. Miss Ye saw four monks who were the killers. Master Lei, there are thousands of temples, how can you be so sure the monks are from Shaolin? You old monk, cut out the excuses. I'm going to find the killers now. Abbot, if you would just summon all the monks for an identification. Master Lei, Master Qiao and Miss Ye, I haven't met anyone as bold before. There's always a first. Abbot, if Master Lei insists, there's a way. Sure, if you could pass two tests On reaching the Hall of Bodhidharma, pass the 3rd test, and then we could answer your request. Our martial arts are well-known, no one could ever made it through these three tests. You should think twice. Are you certain that you can identify the four? Absolutely. Alright. Abbot, it's a deal. Sound the drums and bells. Leave. Yes. You should stay here. Say no more. Odd number is you, even is me. Master Jianxing, you're in round one? That's right, Master Qiao. I hope you can go through the tests, and find out the killers. We won't show any mercy. Then how would I pass? If you make through our Spring and Autumn Formation, reach underneath the plate which reads "Exercise Room". Then you'd have passed. Alright. Master Qiao, pick whatever you want. I don't think they suit me, I've got my own. A short weapon? Short? Not at all, look. Not short, right? Master Qiao, be careful. It hurts me. Very impressive. You want to pass? Not that easy. Master. Master, show some mercy. You want to get over? Master, again? Go! Calm down. I guess you won't make it. Please head back, Master Qiao. What? Back? What would I tell Lei Xun? This doesn't work well enough, Iet me change it. Amitabha Buddha. We can't gamble. Can't gamble? If you don't, I won't pass. Bless me. Where are you off to? Damn it! You've failed me. Master Qiao, what else have you got? Show us. Me? I've got plenty. Explosives? That's low. Sorry about it. A trick. Excuse me, Masters. Master Qiao, you tricked us to pass. But I doubt if your friend can make it through the 1 2 Jingangs Formation. I think otherwise. You don't believe it? Sure win. If I make it pass through you and reach underneath the plate of "Unlimited Powers of the Buddha" then I've passed? That's right, Master Lei. But if you don't think you can make it through our Twelve Jingangs Formation, you're welcome to quit. Fine. Here it comes. Master Lei, our Twelve Jingangs Formation still can't lock you. Even if you give up now, your name will be well-known. My name is well-known already, I don't need to get reputation with the help of Shaolin But I do have a bad habit, I am very persistent. Alright, then change formation. Impressive. Thank you. Since you wouldn't quit, but it's difficult to pass. Anything, in order to find out the truth. Very well, see how can you make it. Change. You didn't keep your word. What word? Look. Forgive me with my little trick. You're all useless. But you're one of us too. I... I'll beat the drum, you sound the bell... Lei Xun has passed. Impossible. Well done, Lei Xun. And see how we make it through the last test. Master Lei has passed the 1 2 Jingangs Formation, Tai Chi Clan's reputation is justified. Thank you. Please prepare for the third test. You've been through a lot today. If we continue, it wouldn't be fair even I win. And it's getting late, go rest and come back again tomorrow. Good bye, Abbot. The Shaolin monks are very nice, if not we'd have been carried out. Too bad the monks won't fight me, or else you've an extra pair of hands. It's the final test tomorrow. Let's have some fun tonight. You have a few drinks, I'm going to gamble. You're here for a revenge for the Six Demons. C'mon then! The whole clan of Heilong (Dragon) is here. Do you think I could get rid of Golden Tiger Can, Tianfang Clan and Baiyun Clan on my own? Chief Long, you think highly of me. You've help, of course. Are you saying that we're all involved? Chief Long, the killers are in Shaolin Temple. Without passing 3 tests we aren't allowed to identify. Have any of you seen the killers? Miss Ye did, there were four. Of course, they are her accomplices. Ye Qinghua, there's no need to be so cruel. It's because I was being wrongly accused. But still you didn't need to be so serious. Look at you Chief Long, don't be so angry. We could wait until tomorrow, then everything will be known. Lei Xun, you would be a good man if you'd just mind your own business. Killing and fighting is so pointless. Now that everyone's here, Iet's go for drinks and a few gambling games. Go... Come in... This is fun. Move to the side. Master Lei, Master Qiao. We won't win by outnumbering you, you two can fight against me. If you could force me onto the ground, then consider yourself passed. If you fall on the ground, please leave right away. Abbot, please start. That was close. The monk tried to trick us. Smart and quick! Abbot. Alright. You two are very skilled. You're not bad yourself. Change formation. Yes. Misters, climb up another level to see further beyond! This old monk is really powerful. We won't win. We must try! We've got to go! Falling down so soon, get back up there. I'll have another bet! You're good! Lei Xun, don't just stand gawking, please help! I can't hold it anymore, your turn. Sure. Master Lei, you two are taking turns, I can still manage. This is called Rotation. It's time, Qiao Yiduo. Got it. We made it. Abbot, we're both on the ground, but he's not. Abbot, thank you for letting us win. You two are very tactful, well done. We must keep our promise. The killers you're trying to find... but we've so many monks here, don't know where to start Abbot. The killers must have broken the rules, I guess they must be in the Hall of Discipline. I can guarantee with my life, there's no murderer in my Hall. Brother Kongxing. Master Lei has passed all the three tests, we must answer their request. You just send out the monks from the Hall of Discipline We'll leave right away if she can't identify anyone. Summon them, for the sake of clearing our name. Sound the bell to assemble them. Everyone from the Hall of Discipline. Take your identification. So? The four in the front are the killers. We didn't do anything wrong, master. We really didn't. That's a malicious accusation, I must kill you. Stop. But we can't rely solely on her statement. You might not believe me, but I saw them stealing at Baiyun Clan. Guess they didn't have the chance to spend it all yet. Fine, go ahead! We have no stolen goods here, is it clear? Can you see? Can you see? Abbot, as the Head of the Hall of Discipline, please punish me for something like this. Brother Kongxing, it's their fault. You didn't' know. That's right, calm down. Master, we were wronged... Brother Kongxing. You losers! How could you do this? The reputation of Shaolin Temple has been ruined in my hands. If I stay on, I would be sneered upon. Brother Kongxing... Amitabha Buddha... Sorry to have disturbed, Abbot. Good bye. You were so rash. Founder Bodhidharma, Brother Kongxing was staunch he did a good job in managing the Hall of Discipline. He always punished the naughty severely, how could there be such bloodless killers? I think that there must be traitors. I'm determined to find out the truth, or else he has sacrificed for nothing. Abbot. Are you feeling guilty because of what happened to Brother Kongxing? Yes. Brother Kongxing sacrificed himself for the sake of our reputation. You don't need to be so sad. If someone's to be blamed, I'm the Abbot, and we have killers among us, which I know nothing about. I should be responsible, I ought to be the one to die. Abbot, please don't think like that. Founder, I'm no longer qualified to be the Abbot, Iet me be. Abbot... Abbot... After I'm dead, you must obey our rules. Leave my body in for 49 days before making an announcement. Abbot. Abbot... Abbot. Amitabha Buddha... Cheers. If it wasn't for me, we couldn't have solved the case so quickly. Well done! Cheers. It's settled, what are you thinking? Of excuses to leave me? So unreasonable. I can leave whenever I want, I don't need an excuse. Lei Xun, you... Calm down, let's drink. Cheers. You drink on your own, you are both so mean. Get out! Now! Show your appreciation! Out! Damn! Lei Xun's gone! What's with the tantrum? Both of you! Out! Don't come back ever! I don't want to see you again. Why should I listen? I'm staying until after dinner. Yiduo...come here. What is it? Let's talk outside. Lei Xun, what's going on? It's not that simple. What is it? Why so mysterious? Look at you! Ye Qinghua likes you so much, and you try to avoid her all day. A man shouldn't do that. That's not what I'm talking about. Then what about? If Shaolin monks are killing others, they can't fake their kung fu. They should know that sooner or later, news will go back to Shaolin Temple. Maybe not. If there's no busybody Iike you, even others might suspect, but they won't have the guts to confront them at Shaolin Temple. You have a point. But when we fought them in Tianfang Clan, they were masked. How could Ye Qinghua identify them? Didn't I tell you? Ye Qinghua saw them when they were robbing the treasure attic. There are so many monks in Shaolin, one can't be sure these 4 are from Hall of Discipline! Right. When I saw them, they were masked. Are you inferring that Ye Qinghua is involved? Not only that, I fear that Chief Long can't make it alive to the base. Where's your thunder arrows? Shoot me... Who are you? Me? The surviving supporters of the Six Demons. You are? Men... Long Tianji... Long Tianji... Not here. Teacher. Aren't you Master Jianxing? That's right. Today I'm Master Jianxing, and I'll be Shaolin Temple's Abbot tomorrow, I'll be the martial world's incharge in the future. Everyone has to listen to me. Why are you doing this to me? Don't you recognize me? We fought. Take a closer look. You want to destroy the evils. Today's your doom day. Go. Ye Cheng, it's a trap. Leave now. Ye Cheng. Ye Cheng. Brother Long, you... Let's go. You're still alive? You should be dead, you killed my wife, such cold-bloodedly. I want you die slowly. Dad, congratulations. Qinghua, you've done a lot. There're still obstacles ahead. You mean Lei Xun and Qiao Yiduo? That's right. We can't use them as pawns anymore. No problem, I'll get rid of them. You four. Here. Follow me. There's no need to be so sneaky! Oh no! What's going on? You must pay for the damages. Bullshit. Inn owner. You killed an innocent bystander. Only now I've found out there's such vicious woman on earth. I'm vicious? You claim that you're the upright clans. In fact you're not much better than us, the Six Demons of Guandong. My mom died by Long Tianji's Thunder Arrows... isn't that more cruel and vicious? So Baiyun Clan chief said, like mother, like daughter. That's right. My dad did this for my mom. Your dad? You still don't know who he is? My father is now the Abbot of Shaolin Temple. Master Jianxing. You befriended us, and used us as pawns. Now that you're done, you want to kill us? I don't have a choice. You know too much. Fine. See if you're good enough to kill us. Not bad. Don't waste such good wine. This is the "Drunken Sword" style, have you seen this before? One could kill when drunk. Any other skills? Show me. They were really something. Shaolin kung fu is famous. What should we do with the bodies? Bury them outside. Not even a coffin? That's a bit harsh, isn't it? Go ahead and buy one if you've such a human touch. I... We were friends, I'll find you a good resting place. Yiduo... Better to be harsh. Yiduo... Jianxing. The Abbot is dead. Amitabha Buddha. We must have a new leader, what do you think? The Head of the Hall of Discipline usually takes up the position, but Brother Kongxing is also gone. You're next in line. I'm not sure whether I'm qualified. That's the rules. Brother Jianxing, don't be so modest. Because of the critical moment, I'll take the job. Greetings Abbot. We'll pray for three days and three nights, for the two, so that they may soon attain nirvana. Come here, Jianxing. What are you doing here, Lei Xun? I've a present for you, to congratulate you on your promotion. Qinghua. Qinghua... Who killed her? You did. I did? That's right, Ye Qinghua was born kind. You've turned her into a cruel and vicious person. Why must you pass on your generation's hatred to your children? Qinghua. Jianxing. You're a shame to Buddhism. What a joke! The Four Families were after Six Demons of Guandong. I was lucky to stay alive, then I joined Shaolin Temple It's all because Bodhidharma was useless... Nonsense. You traitor! Founder Bodhidharma imparted me intelligence, you've finally revealed your true self. You're only ranked third in Shaolin Temple. You still have a lot to learn, what else do you have to say for yourself? I failed. Qinghua, I'm sorry... Master Lei. Thank you for your help. You're very welcome, Abbot. I must help Shaolin Temple to get rid of the traitor. Tai Chi Sword. He wants to kill me, don't let him get away. Jingangs, he's one of the Six Demons. The former Abbot was killed by him. Stop talking rubbish, you're about to die. You are a bad element, I'll kill you for Shaolin. Kill him! Don't let him off the premises. At the worst I'll sacrifice. Stop it. You are still alive? You want to silent me. You're ruthless. Twelve Jingangs. Yes, Abbot. We've got to clean up the trash today. Yes, Abbot. I would be successful if not for you. Amitabha Buddha. Master Lei. Thank you for helping us. You're most welcome, Abbot. Goodbye.
