WE'RE GOING TO BE OKAY. THE TENTS, MAYBE WE CAN GET 200 DOLLARS FOR THOSE, BUT IT'S NOT MUCH. I THINK YOU'LL DO BETTER TAKING THE PACKAGED OFFER, RATHER THAN AUCTIONING OFF EACH ITEM. YOU'LL GET MOST OF YOUR MONEY IN HERE, ALL THE MACHINES. WE CAN TRY THAT. WOULD YOU PREFER TO DO THAT? GOOD LUCK,EILLEEN. [laughing] I HIT YOU RIGHT IN THE HEAD. GET AWAY! I WON. YOU CAN'T CATCH ME.

I LIKE THAT; VERY DIRECT. MY MOM ALWAYS SAYS... SAID, "ASK AND YOU MAY RECEIVE." IT'S SIMPLE ENOUGH, THE NEW OWNER PLANS TO EXPAND THE RESORT. HE WANTS A BIGGER, LIVELIER SHOW; MORE DANCERS. THEY'RE ONLY HERE TO SUPPORT THE SINGERS. PRECISELY. WHAT'S THE SHOW GOING TO BE? THAT WE ARE NOT SO SURE. BECAUSE I KNOW THIS THEATRICAL PRODUCER. HE'S WORKED ON BROADWAY WITH GENE KELLY, CAROL LAWRENCE, THE BEE GEES, OTHER BIG NAMES. HE MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN SOMETHING LIKE THIS. YOU AS A COUNTRY SINGER FROM UP NORTH, HOW DO YOU KNOW BROADWAY PRODUCERS? I GET AROUND. [laughing] "I GET AROUND." [John:] I WAS SURPRISED YOU SUGGESTED ME. I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT. IT DOESN'T HURT HAVING A GUILTY EX-BOYFRIEND DIRECTING THE SHOW. YOU THINK I FEEL GUILTY ABOUT BREAKING UP WITH YOU? I THINK YOU FEEL BAD ABOUT DOING IT A MONTH AFTER MY PARENTS DIED. [John:] I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU ANY SPECIAL TREATMENT BECAUSE OF THAT. [Eilleen:] I DON'T EXPECT THAT. BUT, YOU KNOW I'M GOOD. THIS IS MY CHANCE TO GET BETTER.

I THINK THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. YEAH. WHY AREN'T YOU SINGING THE SONG "WHOSE BED HAVE YOUR BOOTS BEEN UNDER?" WELL, UM... THAT ONE'S NOT GOING TO BE ON THE ALBUM. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THAT'S ONE OF YOUR BEST SONGS. WE'LL LISTEN TO IT AGAIN. THIS ONE'S GOT A REAL CLASSIC NASHVILLE SOUND. IT'S UPBEAT, WITHOUT BEING OVERWHELMING. CAN'T YOU HEAR IT?

I'VE GOT THIS ALBUM COMING OUT, BUT I'M NOT SURE IT'S GOT ANYTHING TO DO WITH ME. YOU'RE NOT SURE? WHY DO YOU SAY IT LIKE THAT? I'M NOT SURE I'VE EVER SEEN YOU NOT SURE. DID YOU FORGET? THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. CAN'T FORGET WHO YOU ARE. THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] HEY, SHANIA! OVER HERE! I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'LL WANT TO HANG WITH US, SWEETHEART. SONGWRITERS ARE THE STRAY DOGS OF THE INDUSTRY. DON'T LISTEN TO HIM. IT COULD BE YOU AND YOUR SONG THERE. "CRY REAL TEARS" HAS A REAL NASHVILLE SOUND. HOW MANY OF YOUR SONGS ENDED UP ON THE ALBUM? TWO. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. YOUR LABEL BELIEVES IN YOU. SENDING YOU OUT ON TOUR AND BUYING ALL THOSE SONGS. YOU'VE GOT A FUTURE HERE. THE QUESTION IS, WHAT KIND OF FUTURE? THE BEST KIND, SUGAR. THE KIND THAT PAYS FOR FOUR HOUSES. SENDS THREE KIDS TO COLLEGE. YOU HERO, YOU. OH, HAIRDOS. BUT HAIRDO NUMBER THREE IS SHEPPERD'S NEXT BIG THING. SHEPPERD TOLD YOU THAT? SHEP'S NOT TALKING TO HIM.

THERE'S SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE IF YOU'RE WILLING TO PLAY THE GAME. DO YOU MEAN HACK OR HAIRDO? THAT'S GOOD. TELL ME MORE ABOUT SHEP. YOU KNOW, TO BE HONEST, I DIDN'T THINK YOU GUYS WOULD WANT TO DO A SECOND ALBUM. A HUNDRED THOUSAND'S A RESPECTABLE NUMBER. IT'S NOT THE HOME RUN WE WERE HOPING FOR, AND THE VIDEO'S DOING GREAT IN EUROPE. KUDOS ON THAT. WE'VE ALREADY STARTED THINKING ABOUT SONGWRITERS FOR YOUR NEXT ALBUM. YES, UM, LOOK, ABOUT THAT... UM, I WANT TO DO MY OWN MATERIAL. PART OF THE REASON THE ALBUM DIDN'T DO WELL WAS BECAUSE OF THE SONGS. DON'T GET ME WRONG, THEY WERE GOOD SONGS, BUT THEY JUST WEREN'T ME. WEREN'T YOU? I'VE BEEN WRITING, AND I HAVE ABOUT AN ALBUM'S WORTH OF SONGS ALREADY. YOU'RE LIKE THE NEXT WILLIE NELSON, RIGHT? I CAN PLAY SOME OF THEM FOR YOU. COULD WE FIND A GUITAR AROUND? DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. YOU WANT TO SING YOUR OWN SONGS, FINE. I'M NOT OPPOSED TO IT. BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO FIND A PRODUCER WHO AGREES, AND WE'LL HAVE TO APPROVE OF SAID PRODUCER.
