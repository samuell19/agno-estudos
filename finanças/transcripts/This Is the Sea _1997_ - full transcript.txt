[MUSIC PLAYING] [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Our life was filled with melody. And it all comes lately. My voice was filled with yearning. That's not all. There's something else. No. That's not all. There's something else. Every word was in my ear. And every note was crystal clear. Oh. PRIEST: With these waters as the early fathers that are holders of our brethren's faith, invite me to baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. [WATER GURGLING] MA STOKES: Welcome to the brethren, daughter dear. [ACOUSTIC MUSIC] Cattle dealing, jibes, and bats, farmers meetings, and all that. It's man's business. She'd be better off tending to the house with me at home. DA STOKES (VOICEOVER): [SIGHS] I was only thinking I'd given her a day out. MA STOKES: Not gallivanting off to a cattle show, surely. Are you never going to let her go her own way? Well, no. I wouldn't keep holed up at home. It's not right. I mean, it's none of my business, except that, well, Hazel were asking, like, you know? [FOOTSTEPS] I mean, she's a grown up lady now. Wanting out and about like any young one nowadays. Aye. Nothing sinister in that. No. No indeed. No indeed. There isn't. PRIEST: The reading is taken from Ezekiel chapter 16, verse 9. Then washed I thee with water. Yay, I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil, and thy renowned went forth among the heathen for thy beauty for it was perfect through my comeliness which I had put upon thee, sayeth the Lord God. But thou didst trust in thine own beauty and playest the harlot because of thy renown and pourest out thy fornications-- [LAUGHS] PRIEST: --on everyone that passed by. That was also taken of thy fair jewels which I had given thee and made it to thyself images of men that commits whoredom with them. [LAUGHS] PRIEST: Moreover, thou has taken my sons and my daughters who now was born into me. And these has thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Shh! PRIEST: Is this of thy ordinance a small matter? Amen. Amen. [INAUDIBLE] was down the rigging. All right. [ACOUSTIC MUSIC] [AMBIENT SOUNDS OF NATURE] HAZEL: Da! Da! Da! [COWS MOOING] RADIO ANNOUNCER: By the Framework document is now hoped for as negotiations continue on the subject of the decommissioning of Ireland's [INAUDIBLE]. There is as yet no formal statement regarding the demobilization of troops. [CLICK] All your lifetime, this nonsense has been going on. Aye. I reckon. MALACHY: Hold position. Starter flag, and they're off. PADHAR: No, they're not. Green flag. MALACHY: Black flag. PADHAR: Yes, it is. MALACHY: No! PADHAR: Yes, it is. MALACHY: No, it's not! PADHAR: Yes, yes. Go on. Go, go, go! - Go on, go, go, go! Black flag, black flag. Black blag, but Schumacher's ignoring it. He's ignoring it. [INAUDIBLE],, sliding up on the inside. [INAUDIBLE] Schumacher went on. [INAUDIBLE] about to give way. - And let's give way. [INAUDIBLE] Take the turn. Take the turn, and swing it across that lane. [INAUDIBLE] just got off. Well-timed turn [INAUDIBLE]. Oh, my god! Oh, I just-- Schumacher's off the course! Schumacher's off the course! - Oh, that's a shake! That's a shake! That's a shake! - Yeah! - Fuck me! I'm Formula 1. Superior! AUCTIONEER: And before we get this morning underway, I have been asked on by the Northern Ireland Agricultural Committee, responsible every year for the agricultural show here at Balmoral in the heart of Belfast-- MALACHY: Come on. She must have blown you around, eh? You're bleary-eyed. PADHAR: For fuck's sake, I only left her at home. MALACHY: Too pissed to make it on her own, was she, eh? Aye. Far too pissed to make it with me, anyroad. Boom, boom. You need passes there, boys? AUCTIONEER: This is the first show to be held in times of peace in 25 years. As a result, we have a great many visitors from overseas-- MALACHY: OK, Padhar, what the hell is this? You swore to me. - What? MALACHY: You swore this gig was legit. Ah, don't be getting all fucking twisted on me. It's just getting in that takes a little bit of lubrication. AUCTIONEER: Welcome to the shows and sales here today, where we should be handling all manner of breeds across the day. I've seen some fine Simmental and Angus, as well as some more usual Irish breeds being [INAUDIBLE] this morning. PADHAR: Serious! Hold on. For Christ's sake.

No. Jesus Christ. AUCTIONEER: We start the bidding this morning. So welcome here to the sale today. And we start off with a beast from the Glen's country. And I believe an opening bid of 2,000 guineas is what is being sought today by farmer O'Reilly. And I'm not going to sell it if we don't get any more. 600 guineas. I hear 600. And if there's-- - There you go. - Thank you. Thank you, aye. AUCTIONEER: I wouldn't be sure we've even met the reserve. Do I hear any more, any more than, yes, 70. And 80.

Hm? Ketchup or Worcester? Hazel? As in the nuts? Nuts all here, so nuts can't breathe. One. Here. Ketchup's fine. MALACHY: Fine. Two. It was a bit rough on you this morning, the car horn making that animal start. AUCTIONEER: And if we could start the bidding for the [INAUDIBLE] now, ladies and gentlemen-- [MUSIC - MIKE SCOTT, "SHE IS SO BEAUTIFUL"] (SINGING) She is so beautiful. I've got no words to describe the way she makes me feel inside. All my road is before me. And I never did plan on a wife. Yet she's the most beautiful soul I ever have met in this land. Hazel! Your Da are weird. He's not my dad. Old enough to be. I really got to go. Boyfriend? I've really got to go, honest. MALACHY: Be seeing you then, huh? (SINGING) She is so beautiful, light filled, loving, and wise, laughter dancing in her eyes. [MAKES KISSING NOISES] MALACHY: Fuck off. PADHAR: I'm telling you. - What? - No two ways about it. Definitely. - Definitely what? Aye, definitely. Sure as black is black. Would you crap off? Definitely what? PADHAR: As pure as blue is blue, and no doubt about it. Blue what? PADHAR: Blood, royal blue. Bullshit. PADHAR: I'm telling you. You see the way she spun off there? You can toss a lot of baggage in. What the fuck are you on? A dead giveaway, huh? No conscience, no Catholic conscience. What the fuck of it, anyroad? Ooh. Ooh, you like her a little? You like her a wee bit, do you? You want to give her a little kiss? Give me your kiss. Go wank yourself, will you? [MUSIC PLAYING] It would take the weight of the world off an Atlas, the size of that there yonder. What about that young fellow? What'd you say to my ma? Oh, that there was this here fella who swore blind he'd commit suicide if I didn't take him, or take you, back up to Belfast. What'd you say to her, really? That's what I said, really. Honest. Is there something wrong? Where have you been? Nothing. Nowhere, really, just up the hill. Do you not need me to stay clear of that Old Man Jacobs? Ach, [INAUDIBLE]. I like talking to him. He's different. What's the harm, hon? Maybe you'd give me a hand out here with the tea. There's a good girl. [MALACHY IMITATES ENGINE REVVING] So will we see it in the basement tomorrow night? MALACHY: Aye, we just might. And Padhar? MALACHY: My brother? Yeah. ROHAN: He's a good man, your brother, a good man on the job. MALACHY: Uh-huh. Still, there's a price to be paid for everything, a price to be paid. Aye. ROHAN: Costly business, this ceasefire. Uh-huh. Course, Padhar there would know, but-- MALACHY: Aye. Just saying, Padhar, good pedigree. Like your man here. MALACHY: Fucker. Better be watching out for you, OK? MALACHY: Aye. And we'll be seeing you too, mugger. Can't comment on that fucking bastard, the way he's on to you. He's a piece of piss. He doesn't get anywhere close. What's he on about, anyway? It's a raven. MALACHY: What, in the MG? You could use that thing and drive it up his arse. It's the Red Rocket Blaster. [IMITATES ENGINE REVVING] Jumps the curb like it's taking off. Those two, three seconds, gonna hand brake? No, [INAUDIBLE]-- - Oh, you're on the track. Going on the track. Back, back, back, back, back. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Bingo. That'll do. I have to get the keys off Cathy. MALACHY: What'd you say? The keys for the cab. You be all right with that? - Come here. What? MALACHY: And now we have Schumacher, yes, Schumacher, running downhill. Oh, aye, on a winning streak. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Wa-hey! Wa-hey! - [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] - Hey! Wait! Hey! [MUSIC - MIKE SCOTT, "A MAN IS IN LOVE"] (SINGING) A man is in love. How do I know? He came to walk with me and told me so, and the song he sang. And then I knew, a man is in love with you. We'll be needing an extra pair of hands. Time we got the herd down. I've never seen any harm in a man having politics. Aye, reckon you're right, minded they're right-intentioned and, uh-- Aye, aye. I'd not condone a gun with him, though. Well, you know, there goes times past when we set you wondering on it. And now, these times present, you'd wonder, maybe, on their right to employ it. The gun? They'd have put you all a-kilter just thinking on it. Certainly, a referendum may herald some sort of a change, but-- Aye, and sure, if it doesn't, those Catholics will have us outbred in 10 years, anyroad. Youse talk, all youse, as if we're sold out already. Sure. Aren't we? Aye, she's nearly a woman in her own right now. JACOBS: Aye. Her Ma had a Jeff at her age. Doesn't bear dwelling on. Aye, aye. Indeed. It doesn't. Those boys are getting pretty pissed off at you, Padhar. Jesus. Get off my back, would you? It's the amount that's still owing on your cab. For Christ's sake, Rohan, I've more than done my piece for yous. They're saying no more payment in kind. Times have changed, huh? Aye. And we still have work to do, cease fire or no cease fire. Youse lot are never going to give over, are you? ROHAN: Easy, Malachy. This must be your pride and joy, hm? Of course, there's, uh-- there's a lot of things need protecting these days. It's insured, Rohan. Back off, huh? Oh. Not the class act they used to be, Padhar. What? The Lloyds, the insurance scheme. I'm sure one racket's as good as another, eh? Oh, aye. I'll see you right later, Rohan, OK? Mm-hm. Give us the mustard. You'd do well to watch him. Huh? Keep an eye on that brother of yours. Early morning are hard on him, you know? Don't be mean to him. You know how it is. Uh-huh. Do it, or we'll do it. [INAUDIBLE] How much is that? PADHAR: [INAUDIBLE] ROHAN: What? [INAUDIBLE] the mustard. I said, how much is it? PADHAR: It's 1.50 for a hot dog. 1.50 for a hot dog? [SCOFFS] That's expensive. I'm, uh-- I'm heading into town. I could show you around in it if you want. Well-- Go on. OK, then. - Catch you later, Padhar, huh? - Huh? MALACHY: Catch you later, man. - Where are you going? MALACHY: [INAUDIBLE] It's just a [INAUDIBLE].. PADHAR: [INAUDIBLE],, take your time. I will do. I've always felt like-- like this was somebody else's setting, like I didn't belong, just a tolerated tourist, as if the city fathers is just waiting all the time for one of us to fuck up. Aye. I kind of know what you mean. It's nuts, isn't it? Hazelnuts. Sorry. - Oh, jeez. - Oh. Be out in a second, son. All right. I'm on my way, son. Have you the trolley in the car for me? Sorry, Ma. It's gone. Gone? Gone where? No, the cab, I mean. It's-- it's-- it's warped. It's fucking up [INAUDIBLE]-- Language, Padhar, please. I'm sorry, Ma. Are you sure you came home in it? Remember the time you left it-- I drove up here 20 minutes ago. I still-- I still have the keys in my pockets, and everything. You're not serious. Ach, you must have left it-- Haven't I locked it? For fuck's sake, Ma. Padhar, language, please. I'm sorry, Ma. Shit, Rohan's lot. I swear to God, I'll get the fuckers at this-- Hold on now. I'm for ringing the RUC. Oh, catch yourself on, Ma. If it's stolen, it should be reported. Ma, Ma-- they'll laugh in your face, Ma. Christ's sake, Ma, let me at it-- Language, please. Just let me at it in my own way and my own time, Ma. I'm not much taken with your way of thinking, not the minute. Oh, hello. Uh, police, please. Here, come with me. Will you come out with me, then? Tonight, like. I don't know. You see-- It's no big deal. It's just a few jars or [INAUDIBLE].. Like later on tonight? There's just a band plan and all. That's it. It's just that it's difficult to get up and down from home. Ach, we'll get you home, all right. It's no bother about that. Well? Maybe. I think I've got to get back now. Christ Jesus, your fierce hard on a fellow. I don't mean to. I mean, I'll try. The basement, then. Everyone knows it, yeah? Yeah. All right just open the door there. We know you're in there. [KNOCKING] Come quietly now. We don't want any racket out here. Excuse me, Miss. Is your mom home now is it? No racket you say? You have every neighbor at the door. Yep, sorry, missus. Your mom home now Missus? No, and it's Miss actually. Yeah all right. Just have a wee bit of cooperation. Sorry for troubling you. Just looking for young Padhar. Well, he's not here. Well, have you any clue where he might be? He's way around his ma. To bring her shopping. Has he taken her in his cab? So far as I know. What's all this about? AZV 5126. Does that sound familiar? That's the registration. Well then he's got some explaining to do. What about? It was found of the Donegal Pass with 100 pounds of Semtex jammed into it. That's high grade explosives to you, Miss. Right. Ah! You get confused? Thanks a fucking bunch. I'll be waiting for you when you get out. You better be. Don't we always watch out for you? We know what's going down. Trust me. We have ears in places that you would not imagine. [SIREN] Well, now. Things have come to some pass when did you come knocking on my door. AZV 5126, I'm here to collect my car. That's it. But it was reported stolen this morning. I know. And you think you're off the hook? Hm? I'm sorry. Controlled explosion. It was jammed full of Semtex. Fuck's sake! You didn't have to fucking fuck it. Hey, listen, I'm only joking. It's right in the depot. The forensic are giving it the once over. Hey, come on up. We might as well go eat chat now you're here. - Up? - Yeah. Come on ahead. This has nothing to do with our lot. So, what's this you have to tell us? I've nothing to hide. I made no comment. Hey, take it easy, kiddo. What's the news then? Any message from the boys? No comment. Or have you just a few things you want to get off your chest? Like personal? Go fuck yourself. Oh, Padhar. We're only doing our job here. It was them at it again. That's all I have to say. Who was it that's at it again? Huh? For fuck's sake, you know as well as any of us. Disruption tactics, all that shit. Do I need to go on here? OK. Will you just sign for me there, please? It's the release form for your cab. It's not a statement. [SNICKER] Where are you off to tonight? Oh, Saturday night, the usual, Ma. Nothing special. Oh. REPORT ON RADIO: This from the province. And in the wake of isolated so-called disruptive incidents, such a move is unlikely to be formally-- Will you stop flapping about, Ma? I can't hear the radio. REPORT ON RADIO: --quantity of high grade explosives were found in the boot of a Belfast city black cab following a tip off. The owner of the vehicle has been detained for questioning. The vehicle had been reported as stolen in advance of the tip off, but no code was given. A spokesperson on behalf of the IRA has accused loyalist activists of disruptive tactics. So they found another stash of ammo, Ma. Will you take no notice? Sure, Padhar will drop in later in case you called the bulletin. I don't mind telling you, many's the day I'd have fantasized about putting you down. It's nice to know I have friends on the inside. That doesn't mean you're in the clear from here. There's some serious stuff tagged on your pal Rohan. Nothing I know nothing about. We're on to him. You'd do well to disassociate. Who said I was associated? Look, we've got eyes where you wouldn't imagine. But if you ever want out, we're listening too. You finished going over that car then? Yeah. Go round the back and sign it out. Never known you so bothered to go to a prayer meeting before. And on a cold, windy Saturday night like this one, are you that determined. Aye, Ma. Have you checked that? I mean, are you sure there's a bus back that late from Belfast? Aye, Ma. You know, Rohan and the lads, they haven't collected direct from the IOC. [INAUDIBLE] going over from that mill town, and get Wilson, those bastards. Fuck, they knew it was a setup though. Fuckers! Right outside my ma's house. Do you believe all that setup stuff, huh? Ruining the lives, I swear to God. Made me look like a right spur prick toffed up at Mill Town and the bloody thing had the back jammed full of Semtex. The bomb squad all over it like a bloody [INAUDIBLE].. Jesus H. Christ. Put a miller on that [INAUDIBLE].. Hush, hush. Everything worked out all right in the end. That's not exactly the point, though, is it? Well, look who's here. Well, if it isn't the mechanic from [INAUDIBLE].. Malachy, come on. Have a drink. A drink for my friend here. We're uh, doing a big job next week. Looking for a good driver. Is it regular? Well, of course it is. You know the score. You do the job. We take care of the rest. Like you did Padhar today, huh? No hard feelings, Padhar, hey? We're not asking you to blow up the Houses of Parliament you know. - Can never be too sure. [INAUDIBLE] We got some decent vibes singing its way through the ether here. Ladies and gentlemen, [INAUDIBLE] gentlemen. Thank you. Mr. BK. Mr. BK himself. Ladies and gentlemen, point of order, please, point of order. Point of order. Turn that jukebox off. Hey. Turn it off.

As long as the seasons need to follow their plan. How long will I be with you? As long as sea [INAUDIBLE] wash up on the sand. How long will I want you? As long as you want me too. Didn't think you'd come. I promised, didn't I? You did. I did. It's just with the weather and all. (SINGING) How long will I hold you? As long as your father told you as long as you are. Come here and meet my brother. (SINGING) As long as I live to you however long you say. How long will I love you? See, that's what I'd do in that situation. Sure you would. Hey, Padhar, do you remember Hazel? I scared the shit out of her at the market the other morning. Oh, aye. Aye, the rodeo girl. Very impressive the way you hung on to that animal. Thanks. Good to see you're all in one piece, though. Most definitely still in one piece. Would you give over, son, will you? Come on, Hazel, we're out of here. Come on. Thank you. [INAUDIBLE] Get her in the car. There you go. You all right? Yeah. You all right? Take it easy, Padhar. Jesus, man get a move on, Padhar. Get in the car. Padhar, for Jesus sakes.

Catch your death. Just Mama. She worries about Padhar. That worries me. HAZEL: I kind of like him. MALACHY: Who? HAZEL: Your brother. MALACHY: What? HAZEL: Not like that. MALACHY: Like what then? HAZEL: Just you know. MALACHY: You've got me worried now. Know what worries Ma the most, after Padhar that is? No. What? The state of my soul. She even has Father McGregon stop me every other day in the street and ask me when was the last time I was at confession. Serious? He wouldn't be bothering me if she wasn't putting him up to it. I'm sure they mean well. God, I'm rabbitting on. Tell me to shut up. [CRIES OUT] Leave me alone. What did you expect? Some promiscuous Plymouth broad who'll play along with you?

Hazel, I mean, Hazel, the way she's off up to Belfast at the weekends. These prayer meetings. And no chat about it, who she's with or what she's about at all. Aye. Well, she speaks to you.

He mention anything to you? Go on home with this. There's no use inventing trouble. There's enough of it around these days. Maybe she really doesn't want to talk to you. Sure. Fine. But I'd rather hear it from her. Maybe she doesn't want to tell yourself. Maybe she's dead, who knows? Maybe she never existed at all. I'd like to speak to Hazel, please, Mrs. Stokes, please, Mrs. Stokes. Stupid bitch. I've never seen you so hung up on a girl. I'm really sorry you never saw fit to bring her home. I've told you.

You could grass. Padhar, you know stuff. I've more than my rap for you guys. I'm not suggesting for one moment that you would divulge anything. What do you want? You know me no better than that. I know you'll hold good, if only if it's for your own sake. But it's your wee brother here I am concerned about. He's never been involved. No allegiance. Striking. The kid's as clean as a whistle, Rohan. I don't want him getting involved. This isn't your call, Padhar. He's just a kid, for Christ's sake, Rohan. He doesn't know a fucking thing. You know the routine yourself. Coach him. Then let him decide for himself if he has the appetite. What do you say, Malachy? Malachy. Hm? Malachy. See, fucking useless. Work on him. Coach him. You've got more than yourself to be concerned about now, Padhar. With that wee one. Come on. Malachy, come on. Wonder at us, carrying that flag up there. The way we're been let down. We'll hold out, Ma, never fear. (WHISPERING) Malachy makes me melancholy. Does he ever dream of me? Malachy makes me melancholy. [MOOING] [WHISTLES] Hm? Oh. [INAUDIBLE] help me. I've run that young fellow for you. Huh? Here, come back. Come back! Here! Come back! Ma, I'm back. Is there anyone looking for me? No, she's not run yet. But your brother's here for his tea. Seems as there's no cooking being done up the road since that wee one arrived. Think I'm only here for the food? Huh, you're here for the beer. That's you all over. Malachy, call Jacobs. Ma, did you take this here message? Forgot. Very untalkative sort of man. He wouldn't say his business. When, when did he ring? Earlier this evening just. Take it easy. [INAUDIBLE] Well, he's getting right touchy this one. You'd tell me if he was in any sort of trouble, Padhar, wouldn't you? He's in love, Ma, not in trouble. Same symptoms, that's all. Yes, Ma. No, Hazel, it's me, Jef. Do you want in? No, it's just a message Jacobs asked me to do. Aye. If you're over at his place by lunchtime, we'll get you on a 3:00 train to Belfast. That's all it means. I'll meet you there and drop you at the station, OK? Aye. Thanks. They will get into City Station, 3:00. She'll be on it. It's a red MGB. She knows it. 3:00 then. Listen, thanks. Hey! I'm on a winning streak now. Just watch. You going to the Basement, huh? A pint, could murder a pint. - Jesus, you're on. What's all this about? Small pleasures, brother, they're the thing. Come on. I'm gasping. Make it The Crown. You should stay shy of The Basement for a bit. Yeah? Rohan there has you marked. Christ, I wouldn't mind Rohan. I'm serious, Malachy. He wants you in. I'd lay low. I thought you guys were on a time out. There's supposed to be a fucking cease fire on. Hasn't he-- - The lads are bored. They're turning on each other. Who knows what? Who can stick what to who. Who's protecting who. It's like none of us knows which way is up anymore, except it's not the way it used to be. And I'm marked now after that car incident. They think I know something about it? What are you on, Padhar? I think they don't know what you know and it frightens them. What frightens them even more, they don't seem to frighten you. But they sure as hell frighten you. Like I said, we all know too much. All right, so come on now. [INAUDIBLE] Hey. Leave your keys at reception. Or clear up before you go out. Right. God damn it. I'm going to have to change that flat. That's not flat. It'll blow out on us. Down them there roads. Come on. Give me a hand. No. Can't it wait? I'm going to miss the train. Where's Jef then? Jef? I have no idea at all. Some machine. Aye. We'll, we'll be needing you this afternoon for a job, as we discussed, remember? Can't. Got a prior engagement. [LAUGH] Prior engagement. I'm meeting someone. VIP off the 3:00 train. You hear that, Padhar? VIP. City Station, is it? That's some coincidence. I can't, Padhar. I just can't. I'm meeting Hazel. Yous could swap. Here. All right. You pick her up. What do you want me to do? That's more like it. And we'll forget what we might call your earlier reticence. Padhar there will do the honors, give you your instructions. Just a bit of chauffeuring. Who for? Let's just call it a personal favor. OK? Beautiful car. Beautiful. - Padhar, what have you done? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Listen, Malachy, they had us over a barrel. Either you're in or I'm being sent on. It's funny isn't it? Bleeding fucking hilarious. You just make sure you're there for Hazel. What? Hazel. Don't forget about her. Would you trust me? I'll have to. Look, where am I heading? Oh, just park on the bridge above City Station and wait there for Rohan. [HONKING] All right, all right. What am I supposed to do then? Nothing, just, just hang in for a minute. It's just documents or something he's picking up for the [INAUDIBLE] tomorrow. I'm not listening. Don't panic, all right? It's nothing heavy. He'll tell you what to do from there. I don't want to know. Then don't ask. I didn't. [HONKING] [INAUDIBLE] [MUSIC - THE WATERBOYS, "THIS IS THE SEA"] [MUSIC - THE WATERBOYS, "THIS IS THE SEA"] (SINGING) Yeah, I hear there's a train. It's coming down the line. It's yours if you hurry. You've got still enough time. And you don't need no ticket. And you don't pay no fee. And you don't need no ticket. You don't pay no fee. Because that was the river. This is the sea. That was the river. This is the sea. That was the river. This is the sea. That was the river. And this is the sea. That was the river, the river, the river, the river, the river, the river, the river, the river, the river, the river, the river. [EXPLOSION] [MUSIC PLAYING] Hello? Hello? Is there anybody home? What time is the next train? Well the one you missed ran near on time. And the next one should do too. It'll be five minutes late at most. Which means it should be getting to city at about half past, but they've just been on the phone to say there is a blast on the lane or something. So it's likely be canceled. Car bomb. Central Station. There's be no more trains tonight. You'll be better off at home anyway. Young fella in a wee red sports car. Shocking, isn't it? Give me a hand here. All right. Get her out to the car. [SIRENS] POLICE BULLHORN: This is a police investigation. Quietly and orderly now. Leave the station building. This area has been cordoned off. Clear the area now please. MALACHY: In this cordoned off area, this bunch of pigs pulled my brother into black plastic police bags. It was meant for me, must have been. Me on the bridge, powdering my car instead. Fucking hell. Padhar? Aye, Jacobs. It's me, Malachy. Jacobs, it's Malachy. Malachy? MALACHY: Aye. Jesus Christ. [INAUDIBLE] (TEARILY) Where the hell is Hazel? She's, she's here. I mean, we, we missed the train. I heard something on the news. I think Hazel thought that you were in the-- but not that. Jesus, Malachy. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry for your trouble. I'm so sorry, Malachy. Padhar was in the car, not Malachy. Aren't you some class of a woman become? Courageous. I admire your courage, Hazel. [CRYING OUT] Just spoke to the kid, Malachy. I asked him like you said. He doesn't know who Jef is, he says. That's crap. He's been poking the bastard's sister for months. And I believe him. The betting money's on you, scum. You've had it in for that lad, Padhar. We have our sources. You guys know fuck well that our cells have been in lockdown. Absolutely nothing going down. You know the way we used to operate, tight instructions. There are none. No instructions. Well, the onus is on you to prove yourself. The rest of us only know what you scum are capable of. And this nasty little piece of work has the smell of you all over it. Hm. So, for the last time, and for the record, what were you doing at Central Station? (IN A ROBOTIC VOICE) I was meeting a friend. Name of the friend. No comment. [LAUGHING] What are yous holding me for? No comment. What were you doing in the victim's cab? He lent it to me. Haven't we been through all this before? We can't verify that the victim lent you his cab because he's dead. And you won't verify the name of the friend you were there to meet. We're not holding up very well here, are we? Know something? I find this really boring. You're damn fucking right it is. But we're going to get you on this one. You mark my words, even if we have to-- get him out of here. Right. You won't pin this on me or any of us. Fucking Britters. [SMACK] Ah! Get him! She'll sleep through the day any road, I'd say. She must have been running round half the night out there by the cut of her. Aye. Poor wee thing. What did you say his name was? Padhar, Padhar McAliskey. There'll be a funeral, no doubt. He's one of ours and that's for sure. It'll be an emotive occasion. She won't be going. Why not? Not our-- Aye. I suppose in this case, it would be better if she stayed away. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [GUNFIRE] Come on, boys! Come on, move it. Come on! I don't know who half the people are, Malachy. Take me home, would you? Malachy. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Can't be certain. Can't be sure. Tells me that you can't be too careful. [PRAYING] PRIEST: We commend to Almighty God-- And we commit his body to the ground. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. May the Lord bless him, and keep him. May the Lord make his face to shine upon Him, and be gracious to Him. The Lord-- She didn't come with you, did she? You don't seem to understand. She's not too well. I understand her not coming to the funeral. Sure I'd have stayed away myself, if if I'd known. Bloody excuse for [INAUDIBLE] circus act. But you could have sent some flowers, or something. Shouldn't you have? And not a word. Not a bloody word. I have no prejudice with protestants. You know that. But he's something to do with her, and she's something to do with this. Isn't she? Don't ask me what you know I don't know, Ma. There's enough bitterness between people that I-- When I left your father, even though-- What are you trying to say, Ma? Go get her back, Malachy. If that's what you want. If it's what you want. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Whenever you're near, I whispered your name. His eyes were closed. A man is in love. And he knows. A man is in love. How did I guess? I figured it out while he was watching you dress. You give your [INAUDIBLE]. I think maybe you should think about getting Cathy out of here. And he's me. She's [INAUDIBLE]. - Aye? - Mhm. Yeah. [CYMBAL CRASH] (SINGING) A man's in love. How do I know? I heard him talk too much. I-- Cathy? You think you're great, Malachy boy, don't you? There's nothing could touch you. MALACHY: Come on, Cathy. Come on. You think you're just great. MALACHY: My mind's made up about this. I'm taking no charity from you, McAliskey. You shouldn't be by yourself. Come on. Just come on home. Fuck you! You fucking show off little MG. Playing it up to that wee proddy girl, like she doesn't know the difference between anything hard won, and fought for if you-- Ask yourself what the fuck happened, would you? Say something. For Jesus' sake, say something. Why wasn't it you? It was fucking meant for you, and you fucking know it! It was meant for you! You, you! It was fucking meant for you, you fucking lucky bastard! You-- - I know. I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, all right? Why wasn't it you? I'm sorry. Why wasn't it you? Let's wrap it up, folks. Eh? Hey. What? Fucker. So you stopped at home, then? Oh, aye. Back here. Trains were canceled for the rest of the day. And Jef Stokes-- was he still here? Who? Jef. Oh, Jef? All day. Doing odd jobs around the house, and that. Well, push on, then. Listen, thanks very much for your help. Sorry for troubling you. You're welcome. Good night to you both. Goodnight. Easy as you go around there. It's a terrible night. That poor child in the rain. God forsaken deer country, these parts. Stuck in a time warp. Yep. Hick sticks, all right. The alibis will hold. Mhm. Come on. Come on in out of the rain. Stay there, you. Don't come near me. I never heard a word. I swear, I never heard anything. [INAUDIBLE] Don't call me Pat. And I can bloody well swear if I want to. You lied, you liar. If I had a knife, then I could really kill you for this. You lied. That's a sin. Oh, god, you murdered him! Please leave me be, God! I want to show off and shout, I hate you! You killed him, and I could have loved you, too! What have I done? Jesus. Come on, now. Come on. Come on. Come on, now. Shh. Come on. Come on. Come on, go inside. Come on. Come on. That's a good girl. It's gonna be all right. Good. [INAUDIBLE] Shh. Chance of a jar? Help yourself. I thought a quiet drink-- Just the two of us? Friendly, like. I thought you [INAUDIBLE] since we called the ceasefire? Off duty. Off the record. Not a chance. Oh, well. Some thirst on me. I've just come down from the glens. Uh-huh. What, your, uh-- your usual batch? No, not normally. I went up Stokes' way. See that kid Jef you're on about. And? I talked to an old fellow by the name of Jacobs. Ah, you've got all the right names. Nowhere near Central Station that day. Neither of them. Local station master confirms his story. Something about not getting the girl to the train on time because of a flat tire. And he's alibied the kid. What's his name? Jef. So, what do you think, inspector? Hm-- You can think what you like about my story. It stinks. It's the truth. And I'm sticking to it. You know, this gig aside, we have more than enough on you to put you away until you're wetting the bed, and gunning like a three year old again. Why don't you, then? Well-- it's like this. You see, every time the foreign office dumps one of those wide eyed, rookie civil servant types on us-- junior ministers, they call them-- within a week, regular as clockwork, they land into me huffing and puffing, screaming holy blue murder at some RUC fuck up. They've accessed the national security files. Oh, strictly confidential, they say. A massive oversight. And they punch up a bunch of mugshots, and they get a list of a dozen-- maybe two dozen names. By the way, you're on that list. And there's a clatter of evidence. They'll go through the European Court of Human Rights backwards, and still get a conviction. And they go, what the fuck do you guys think you're at? Take those bastards out. You know who the bastards are. Why don't you move in on them? For Christ's sake, get that list read up. Every single one of them. And they're pissing their pants with SAS dawn raids, and regrettable incidents. And I go, hey. You see that list? Every name on that list has got a list of his own. And guess what? You're on it. OK. But you see, with a ceasefire-- Regrettable incidents, you said? It's getting dirtier. Has to be, before it gets cleaner. That cab gig-- no code on the tip off. All that bullshit about loyalist disruption tactics. Has to get dirtier. Stitching up that poor kid, [INAUDIBLE].. There's off the record, and off the record. We have alibis on the Glen's people. Then dig a little deeper. You're in this somewhere. You'll never stick this on me. I don't mind getting my hands dirty. Dig a little deeper. And I mean dirty. But of course, there's always that list. Old man Jacobs' house. I just know he's involved with them. Uh-huh. He planted the bomb. No. Jef did. No. I'm his sister, and I'm turning him in. Are you going to call the police, then? I already did. Aye. You're some class of a woman become. I would envy me nay. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SIREN] Where is she? Jef-- what happened tonight? Yeah. You'll have to tell us. [SIREN] Leave this to me! He's my son. No. Wait, wait. No. Easy. Leave it. [BEEPING] [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) When I left my home and my family, my mother said to me. Son, it's not how many Germans you ¦ that counts, it's how many people you set free. So I packed my bags, rushed my cab, walked out into the world. 17 years old, never kissed a girl. [GUNSHOT] [SHOUTING] Give me the gun! Get out! [GRUNTING] Go on! No! Leave me alone! Please, no! For God's sake, Ma, do something, will ya? Ma! [CRYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) But my only one thing remains. [INAUDIBLE]! Love you the river. Love you the sea. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) These things you keep, you'd better throw them away. You wanna turn your back on your [INAUDIBLE]?? Once you were tethered, but now you are free. Once you were tethered, but now you are free. That was the river. And this is the sea, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Now here's a train. It's coming on down the line. It's yours if you hurry. You've got still enough time. And you don't need no ticket. And you don't pay no fee. And no, you don't need no ticket. You don't pay no fee. Because that was the river, and this is the sea. That was a river, this is the sea. That was the river, this is the sea. That was the river, river, river, river, river, river, river, and this is the sea. Sea, yeah. Behold the sea.
