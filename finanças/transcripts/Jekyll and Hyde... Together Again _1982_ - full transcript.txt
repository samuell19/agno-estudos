Several times You're a... kiss ass aren't you? Yes sir! I like that Now by stimulating different isolated areas of the cortex we can demonstrate that all normal function have been restored arm movement even finger movement Now we must close the scalp Needle and thread Thimble He has the steadiest hands I ever seen Now, are there any question? Does a good physician validate parking? That's a matter of individual conscience Sir, what new surgical breakthroughs are you planning? Actually none....I am giving up surgery I'm sorry class this is the last operation I will ever perform Barbera Plow, I'm a resident specializing in nuclear medicine and I can really get behind everything you're saying and everything... But, it really just blows my mind you know to think you'll never be operating again because you're so mellow and everything you know and like,it really like freaks me out to the max to think that you're quitting on me and like couldn't you do one more operation for us...please Please, please, please no... no, no, no, no From now on,I intend to devote every waking moment to research Research,that I hope will one day unlock mans brain and release survival instincts enabling him to make himself well Research that will one day eliminate the costly,painful,almost inhumane procedure we now call... surgery Owww! Dr. Jekyll, what do you intend to replace suergery with? Drugs Carrew! Don't worry sir, he'll be leaning over you on friday with a knife Rest assured If this operation, doesn't come on... I'll buy this whole block...

Man over the centuries has tried to control the animal side of his nature with his intellect And it is precisely this repression which is at the root of human suffering and illness If only the animal in man can be released... and studied.... If man's inherent primal instincts for survival could be tapped for the good of the organism as a whole. Then...
