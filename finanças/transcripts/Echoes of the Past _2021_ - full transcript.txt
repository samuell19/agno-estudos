- Hi, Greta. - Where the hell are you? I'm on my way. Why? - They filed. - Oh, fuck. When? We got a call from the court clerk. It has already made the news. I thought the Foreign Office had put a stop to this nonsense. Word is, they're filing at the European Court of Justice as well. Combined with the war loan, it's 160 billion euro claim. Shit. What did Saub say? I think he was blindsided. Well, we all were. Okay. I'll be there in ten. Could you please put on the news? I spoke to the undersecretary. We are to deal with the claims of the civilians... before the international court. The justice and finance ministries are going to handle the war occupation loan. Thank God for small favors. I would hate to be the one losing 120 billion euro claim. Does it have legs? The war loan? Like a centipede. The Reichsbank orchestrated the whole plan and seized every single gold bar from the vaults of Greece's Central Bank. The minister wants to see you. Straight away. Tell him I'm on my way. Andrea Ritter, press secretary. What a mess. I thought they weren't going ahead with it. Any claims related to German reparations for crimes committed during World War II is a hornet's nest. The Greeks win... then nothing is going to stop the Polish, the Belgians, even the damn Russians... demanding their own pound of flesh. I thought the 2 plus 4 Treaty of 1990 was conclusive on the matter. Well, the treaty does fail to mention the issue specifically. So, it's a matter of legal interpretation. The preamble does appear to support our argument, though. Legally, Germany no longer existed after 1945. The Federal Republic of Germany... can't be held responsible for the crimes of another country. So... Minister, if I may. Legalities aside, I'm afraid this is a complete PR disaster. The law is firmly on our side. History shouldn't be used as bandage. Damn it, we paid our dues, long ago. Regardless, we still need a proper spin. Anything that might potentially shed different light on the tragedy. Those files downstairs, the witness statements, the role of the rebels played, any... involvement of the British Intelligence, something that we might have missed. I believe we have 72 hours to jump in front of the story. Even if it's just hot air... I don't have to remind you, that even judges read the news. Anything you need, just ask. Hey, Andrea, how are you? How is the best looking lawyer in Berlin? Tired. And it's only Monday. I hope you didn't wait too long. As you can see, I'm drowning in paperwork. - Is it official? - As of this morning. Are you taking the lead? Who else is there? 23 cases before international tribunals and I've never lost a single one. I know, sweetheart. But winning this... I win this one, and the future is mine. Remember Russell? From Mann & Lowe? Son of a bitch was giving me the cold shoulder for months. And today, he called, out of the blue, talking full partnership. What are you having? Not hungry? My stomach is a knot. Nothing goes down at the moment. Is it my place tonight? I'm sorry, I can't. I'm flying out to Greece, first thing in the morning. To Greece? What are you doing-- I've studied the files, read the survivor accounts, looked at the photos. I need to see for myself. Good. Who knows? An epiphany might follow. Aren't you the optimist? Say what you like, Counsellor. But history has the unkindly way to bite you in the ass when you least expect it. Rebels have proven difficult to break. Lately, they've grown even bolder. We suspect the British are... providing them with guns and intelligence. Our occupation of Greece hangs in the balance. We need to establish a strong foothold across the peninsula. And time is not on our side. The Russian Front needs reinforcements. I'm fully aware the situation-- - I need... a man, willing... to make all the tough decisions. It must be hard. Carrying such a past. It is in your file. Major Rudolf Tenner of the 6th Bavarian Regiment. It was at the Battle of Morval, wasn't it? Whatever happened to him? No one knows. The only thing they found was his dog tags. Horrible burden. The sins of the father. A deserter puts such a stain on a family's good name. I hear you are an ambitious man. Play your cards right... the brass back in Berlin... is bound to notice. We know you're hiding in the mountains, but where? Where? Do you think it would be possible to speak to some of the survivors? I'm afraid there is no one left anymore. Most of them are either dead or emigrated to Europe and America... a long time ago. I was hoping I could get a first hand account. Maybe Nicolas Andreou can help you. Last time I heard, he was back from London. Was Mr Andreou... Yes, he was. Poor man. Was only a boy. Just make sure you write a good article. The world needs to know. You carry any weapons? Pistols? Pistols? Papers. Papers. Oops. Pick it up. You can go. What are you doing? What's wrong with you? Do you want to be court-martialed? Where did you find that old thing? I'm surprised it's still here. How come I've never heard of the Austrian before? The Austrian? There are about 14 witness accounts in this dossier that mention-- Yes, yes, I know. Officially he's considered a mere legend. There are only a handful of accounts that claim his existence. And they are far from clear. In fact, this dossier, is all there is. Has anyone ever tried to find out? An Austrian came once, claiming to be him, but he turned out to be a fraud. As I said, no one really accepts the veracity of these accounts. So they're not part of any official record. The Austrian is considered by many a very polarizing figure. Listen, I want you to look up something for me. You need to access the Ministry of Defense's database. Look for any Austrians who served in the 117th Jaeger Division. Anything you can find. Austrians? How is that related? I don't know just yet. I stumbled upon some old files, witness accounts. Call me as soon as you have something. Anything. And go home. I'm Commandant Tenner of the 117th Jaeger Division, and the officer is Lieutenant Bruckmann, my personal secretary. I regret the inconvenience, but we will try to cause as little disruption to your lives as possible, I assure you. It is only for a few days. Do we have a choice? No, I'm afraid you don't. A number of houses are commandeered for the housing of Wehrmacht officers. Wish you all a good night. They're chocolates from Germany. It's very good. Goodnight. Thank you. Good morning. What were you doing out in the garden so early? Ahh! Sit with me. Sit with me, little man. Now, do you like magic? Me too. - Good morning, commandant. - Good morning. I hope you had a pleasant night. We have been on the move for two months straight, so... a good bed is always a much appreciated luxury. Please. Now, pick a card. Give it one. For good luck. The 33rd battalion found 78 of our men at the bottom of the gorge. - When? - Dawn. Resistance. Has General Le Suire been informed? Yes, commandant. Bruckmann, take care of my things. Mr Andreou? Mr Andreou? Uhh, I'm afraid I don't speak Greek. Oh! Um, Mr Andreou is being given his chemo treatment. He should be back soon. Thank you. It appears that Mr Andreou left. Against doctor's orders. General. 78 lives. 78 of my men. This is a direct challenge to our authority and it can't go unanswered. Most of the division has been mobilized, General. The troops are ready. A man's soul... is always stained by the color of his actions. There's no escaping that. Even in war. Commence "Unternehmen Kalavryta". Thank you. Come on, keep moving. Hey, come on! Go on. Keep moving. Quick, quick. Go, go, go! Come on! Quick. To the right. Go! Move! Come on. Move! Get inside! Go. Go, go Go, go, go. Come on. I said, move. Theyre just boys, please! They're just boys. Come on. Right, right. Go. Left, right. Go. Move. Come on, left, right! Go, go, go! Move! Move! 500 men were executed... with machine guns that day. 64 of them mere children. I have lived with these memories for so long, they have become... become my scars. Make sure the structure is burned to the ground. Yes, commandant. Oh, my God. Move. Faster. Faster. On the top of the mountain. Form a line. Faster! - Come on. - Move, move! On the top of the hill. On the top of the hill. Form lines. - Faster. - Come on! Everybody. Form lines and turn around! Come on. Everybody turns around. Come on. Come on, turn around. Move. Come on. Go. I made a vow that day to my dead father and brother. That I would not rest until I faced... the man responsible. That one day I would look into the eyes of commandant Tenner. And demand justice. All those years of life... and the best I can offer is that history. That unique, solitary history... each one of us owns, since birth. That very part of... of our past repeats itself over and over... before the eyes of blind men. I better leave you. No one cares about the damn money. The reparations. It's not at all about that. It was never about that. Money these days is, our history is... Is not allowed to forget. To let go. May I ask you one last question? Mmm. What happened to your vow? Did you find commandant Tenner? No. I... I tried for 30 odd years. I... I begged and I pleaded. It's all classified, they said. No one cares. And I... I was just a grieving kid. What the hell did I know? He's probably long dead by now. Ohh! We never got to finish it. Take it, please. For your records. To remember us both. How could one love life if there were no childhood in it? Thank you. Could you please send up a pack of cigarettes? Anything will do. Thank you. It's me. I was hoping you would call me. Are you still at the university? I have all those term papers due tomorrow. - How are you? - I've been better. Not what you expected? - Mmm. - So, what did you find? Remember that saying about the abyss? When you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss-- The abyss also gazes into you. That's how I feel. I should have been there with you. I can still come, if you need me. No, no. It's okay. I'm flying out tomorrow, anyway. Are you coming back? I don't know yet. It's getting late. Then you should get some sleep. Goodnight. Andrea Foss? No one has called me that for a long time. I am Andrea Weiss now. I am Caroline Martin. A lawyer for the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The German Ministry of... What is this regarding? I'm here about your husband, Fredrick Braun. - We better go inside. - Yeah. The one on the top is the last one he sent. A few days before... He was... a wonderful man. Kind... he hated the Nazis... and all they stood for. When he was conscripted... our hearts sank. We've just gotten married. But he had no choice. Except... to become a refugee, a fugitive... flee to Switzerland, as did many of his friends. Why didn't he? For me. I had... my infirm mother to look after. I could not follow him. I begged him. I... I.. begged him. He would not listen. He wouldn't leave me behind. My poor Friedrich. Would you excuse me, please? I'm so sorry if... The man on the right, Nicolas Andreou, is alive because of Fredrick. He was in the school with his mother. If it wasn't for your husband... Thank you. Thank you. We are way past midnight and we need an angle for the press, to spin the hell out of the shitstorm. What happened to the need you mentioned? The good German? Caroline? Are you still there? Yes, Ritter. I'm still here. Stop messing around and get on the case. - I will. - Good. I feel strongly that continuing this course of action would be a mistake... and dishonor the memory of the innocent people who died that day. It is imperative for the German state... to show its citizens that true justice doesn't fade away with time... and that humanity will always prevail. For these reasons... and in good conscience... I feel compelled to tender my resignation, effective immediately. Sincerely, Caroline Martin.
