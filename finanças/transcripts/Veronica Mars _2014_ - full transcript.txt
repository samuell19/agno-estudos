Woman: I need your help, veronica. Man: I think I need your help. I need to know. [ Voices echoing ] Veronica: A teenaged private eye. trust me. I know how dumb that sounds. but it's not like I found a decoder ring at the bottom of a cereal box and thought, "that sounds like fun." I wish. that would have been adorable. nope. my best friend was murdered when I was 15. trying to figure out who did it was how I coped. my dad was sheriff at the time, and when he went after the most powerful man in town, he turned us both into pariahs. Dad lost his job, and I lost my friends. kids can be cruel, after all. the cruelest was logan echolls, my dead friend's boyfriend. like me, logan was fueled by rage and distrust. he wanted to make someone pay. It's likely those qualities are what drew us together. they're absolutely what tore us apart. after my dad was run out of office, he got his pi license and opened an agency. I hung out there to learn the tricks of the trade. there was plenty of work for both of us in the seedy beach town of neptune, california. people might think of neptune as glamorous, home to movie stars and captains of industry. but when the class war comes, neptune will be ground zero. It's a springsteen song... "get out while you're young." I got out when I was 19, leaving a trail of destruction in my wake. I've grown up, though. that was the old me. angry me. vengeful me. new me? people say I'm a marshmallow. [ siren wailing in distance ] Gayle: So, a year at hearst college, b.a. in psychology from stanford, near the top of your class at columbia law. You're due to take the bar in six weeks. A little about us. We're a multi-national firm. 50 lawyers in new york. Our clients here at truman-mann are primarily fortune 500 companies. Our job is to make sure that frivolous lawsuits disappear before they ever reach the courtroom. We're looking at a number of candidates, all with impressive résumés, but none quite as unique as yours. You were issued a private investigator's license for your 18th birthday? Is that something california kids do? My dad is a pi I worked for him. It was more answering phones and handling his travel than anything else. Really? Before you were 20, your name popped up on lexisnexis in 14... 15. 15 separate articles or briefs, in cases ranging from multiple homicides to dognapping. You have a degree in psychology, miss mars. What do you think that says about a person? Compulsive, clearly. Addictive personality. Possible adrenaline junkie. But that's not me anymore. I haven't worked a case since I transferred to stanford. And why is that? The price was too high. It ruined friendships and relationships. It cost me a lot of opportunities along the way. So, your decision to transfer wasn't related to a certain video of you and another hearst student? The sex tape? no need to be coy. Leonard... it's fine. As lawyers, we are often put in adversarial situations. Opposing counsel will seek to exploit any perceived weakness. All I'll say about that tape is it was made and distributed without my knowledge. And I'll ask you, do I look ruffled? Piz: Rebuilding her life took time. More time than you'd think. Zhi howes was broke. And, worse, people considered her passé. She thought about restarting her moribund career with a kickstarter campaign, but the potential for further humiliation was daunting. They brought up the sex tape? I think I handled it okay. I have another meeting tomorrow with one of the partners. I hope we talk s.t.d.s. [ chuckles ] [ Cellphone chimes ] What? wallace. He keeps trying to get me to come in for our 10-year reunion. Not bloody likely. Hey, piz. yeah? Zhi howes' story. how long is it gonna be now? Uh, 12, 121/2 minutes. You're killing me. Hi. hi. You must be the girlfriend who we have heard so much about and never seen. I am. law school. Oh. Um, I'm a really big fan of the show, though. Funny story. I do a pretty wicked impression of you. I don't think we... you don't... i am happy to... uh, veronica and I... we... we dated for months in college and this whole last year, and she's only meeting my parents for the first time next week. She blames law school for that, too. So the fact that she hasn't met my colleagues... v-veronica? Bonnie de ville was found dead in her bathtub. Oh, that's awful. you a fan?

I thought it was there for my alcoholic mom's benefit, but it stayed up long after mom was gone. man: Sheriff lamb, is it true that logan echolls was in the house when bonnie died? lamb: We found echolls passed out next to de ville's body. vasquez: [ spanish accent ] sheriff, are you aware of the video of logan echolls threatening bonnie? get out! [ thud] You're not welcome here! okay, you get rid of him, or you're gonna end up dead. kind of speaks for itself, don't you think? can you speak to the tragedy, the violent death of a celebrity who seemed to have it all?

He's being bombarded by lawyers wanting to represent him. I'm just gonna go out there, see my dad, and help logan weed out the shysters. Well, give logan my best and tell him I've gotten totally used to the loose bone fragments floating around my orbital socket. You may not want to mention that violent streak to his new lawyer.

Uh, I bought a $49 ticket to palm springs. Totally worth it. How was your flight? Good. I would have been fine in coach. But thanks. There's the sun. Do you ever get tired of all this amazing weather? Yeah, and how about them dodgers? [ Chuckles ] Look at us, falling right back into our old rhythms.

I'm just helping him find a lawyer. Mm-hmm. Oh, piz says to tell you hi. Good man, piz. How did he feel about you coming out here to see logan? It's not a social call. He understands that. Mm-hmm.

I'm saying that I wouldn't want to be in logan echolls' shoes. can you name a single person who thinks that kid is innocent? veronica: I can name one. so, what are you gonna do about it, veronica? ready to head down to the batcave? "accessories"? was I trying to keep dad from looking inside? would labeling it "pandora" have seemed a little, what, I don't know, operatic? haven't you spent nine years figuring out exactly who you are? hasn't your life been better since giving this up, getting out of neptune? It was an iniquitous hellhole when you left. and from the look of things, it's only gotten more corrupt. everything you worked for is right in front of you. solid relationship. quality job prospects. a low-profile existence. or does all that just bore the shit out of you, veronica? veronica: It's just a couple more days.

Neither have I. that one. Logan: Really? not what I was expecting. Not the big house. It's unit "b," according to county tax records. My guess is it's the garage apartment out back. I want to get inside. Specifically, I want to get on her computer, see if, "a," she's the one who sent you that email, and, "b," if she had anything to do with those videos from inside carrie's house. I think we would have noticed her following us. You said you found her hiding in carrie's closet. She could have hidden a camera anywhere. A stuffed-animal nanny cam. flowers always work. My dad has a trucker hat that's rigged with a camera. Flowers. that's how she got in. We were having a party. She came over delivering flowers. We just lost track of her in the chaos. You think there might have been a key lying around when you found ruby in the closet? She used it to break in and electrocute carrie? No. It's a wall-and-gated subdivision on the marina. Lots of celebrity homeowners. Former mossad agents patrolling the grounds. Why did you even go over there that night? The tabloids say you broke up with her when you found out she was hooking up with that bozo sean. Dick saw a tweet that night saying that carrie was showing up at the 09er. She had been 10 weeks sober, so I texted her saying, "are you sure that's a good idea?" she calls me back and starts railing on me. later, she texted me saying she's having a moment of weakness and needed my help.

Oh, my god. hilarious... girlfriend. I know, girlfriend. Isn't it? This one is always playing pranks on me. She's good. It's just like george clooney and his friends, you know?

[ Snorts ] bitch. You two are friends? Fast friends. bffs. If both miss jetson and the court agree not to press charges, veronica's free to go. Well, the court is only involved if there's an intent to commit a crime, which there wasn't. So b&e is considered an illegal trespass, a misdemeanor, leaving the charges entirely in the hands of the victim, I.e., ruby, I.e., my bff. [ Clicks tongue ] What she said.

We all got hammered, because it turns out it's pretty boring partying on a boat after about 15 minutes. Woke up the next morning, and everyone is freaking out because we can't find susan. Ripped the boat apart looking for her, but she was gone-zo. last time I saw susan, she was blowing chunks over the side of the boat. She must have slipped and fell off. I heard later that she couldn't swim for shit. What a nightmare. I can't imagine. It must have been awful when you figured out she was missing. I had to go to therapy for post traumatic stress. I still can't go on a boat. Or smell schnapps. It was awful. It was, uh... we drank a shit ton of booze and we all woke up, we were really hung over, panicked out of our minds. It was a crazy night.

Please get this case dismissed before anybody believes the words "time to party" came out of my mouth. Did you have a gun out, eli? I haven't touched a gun in years. Oh. police gave me this. It's a gun reported stolen from a house in weevil's neighborhood. That the police clearly confiscated and planted on him. Well, weevil's record has been spotless for five years. Meanwhile, this is my eleventh client in the past six months claiming that the sheriff's department has planted contraband on them. You have a serial number on that gun? So if we're to believe this police report, weevil left the reunion, dropped off his foxy wife and his "most changed" trophy and, still wearing his dress shirt and slacks, teamed up with the motorcycle gang he left a decade ago to harass the richest divorcée in southern california?

Um... the susan knight drowning about nine years ago. I was just hoping to ask you a few things about it 'cause you questioned carrie bishop. Do you remember? [ Chuckles ] I'm really sorry. How do we know each other again? It was... veronica. veronica. I don't mean to be rude, but the first time that you came around asking me for favors you got all dolled up. And you brought me a pizza. You're a prick. I'm a prick? mm-hmm. [ Chuckling ] you're a prick. Well, I'm a prick. But also I love pizza and I thought, "what a gesture." and you had that red number on and I liked the red number. It made me think impure thoughts. And I feel like this is a step backwards for us. [ Squeals ] there it is. By the way, I didn't know the fbi was looking into the bonnie de ville case. I'm not with the fbi. are you sure? I could've sworn that I heard somewhere that you were with the fbi. Another life, maybe. All right, let me see it. not the pizza. I'm gonna get into the pizza in a minute. This is the whole susan knight case file. how'd you get this? Yo soy un genio malvada. Yeah, when I took carrie's statement that night, she was a complete wreck. She was talking about how it was all their fault. How they were all going to hell. And how they were all supposed to take care of each other. And I tried to get more specifics, but luke haldeman sr.'s lawyer showed up and demanded that he speak to all of them in private. That's when they all, I don't know, decided to toe the company line. They were all drinking, they passed out. They woke up, susan was gone. Yeah, no body was ever found. Never sat right with me. But we never had any evidence to the contrary, so. [ Knock on door ] Someone on the serendipity killed carrie. I would bet my life on it. Okay. Gia goodman. Luke haldeman. Stu cobbler. Your longtime companion. Dick. Hey, iron mike. Have you seen the instagram feed from the reunion? Some hilarious shots from the fight. Check out your boy, piz. kapow! [ laughs ] Oh, there's another one back here too. Hey, you didn't tell me you and piz were a thing. My love life didn't seem relevant. Wait, what was that? Toya lagrone's hoobity boobities. No, back one. okay. What? Dick: What d'you see, a ghost or something? This is a police photo of the boat the morning after susan knight disappeared off of it. Notice anything? Uh, the police photo is black and white. The anchor. [ Sighs ] exactly. I don't see an anchor. not in this one. Here is where it normally goes. Okay, so? So, my first guess is that there is no anchor because it was used to make sure that susan knight's body sunk to the bottom of the pacific ocean. [ Scoffs ] California has the death penalty, dick. So, why don't you act like you give a damn about your friend and tell me what really happened that night. I already told you, veronica, okay? And I don't think this has jack to do with carrie's murder. [ Cellphone vibrates ] God, I wish logan could quit you. I'm your friend. are you listening to this? I need your computer. Yeah, well, at least you asked nicely. Sean: Hey, you got any more of those cupcakes? bonnie: You're still here? why? Is your boyfriend showing up? [ chuckles] She's sitting at her makeup table. That angle, that's exactly where she kept her tablet docked. So the feed could be coming from the tablet camera. People can do that? They can spy on you from your own tablet? I don't know, but I know someone who would. Nobody could be spying on you from your normal out-of-the-box tablet computer. but it is possible. someone would have to modify a wireless model, install additional hardware. It... it would be complicated. there were galaxy tablets in the gift bags at the mtv music awards. I know because carrie was making fun of james franco for trying to walk off with, like, six. Franco. You guys see that candid-camera video of him trying on skinny jeans? shit is hilarious. Show me. Well, I believe I have that bookmarked right here. Sayonara, mac. Let's get weird! [ grunting ] Veronica: There may be six degrees between anyone on the planet and kevin bacon, but if you're under 30 and living in southern california, you're never more than two degrees from james franco. In this case, dick to facialist, facialist to franco's assistant. then something to get that assistant's attention. all right, let me see if I'm understanding this correctly. You do not have in your possession pages from tolkien's original manuscript for the quenta silmarillion depicting beren wandering into doriath and falling in love with lúthien, the elf king's daughter? I do not. what? You didn't check this out, penny? Yes! You recently attended the mtv movie awards, and I'm fairly certain that whoever gave out the gift bags at the awards gave tablets that were preloaded with spy software. Really. you might have noticed that there have been some strange videos of you circulating the internet lately. How strange? like, naked strange? No. Just one of you trying on skinny jeans, and one of you in your underwear trying to list words that rhyme with orange. [ Cellphone vibrates ] yeah. It's so hard. Borange. corange. Derange. Well, that's not that bad. Penny floats in and out of frame in a few of the videos, so I was hoping we could use her to smoke out who's ever doing this. Or I could just play her in drag. Penny, give me your glasses. Hey! so you're interested in hidden camera celebrity footage. If you've got the cash, I've got some hidden video I know you'll want to see.

Yeah, but it better be weird. I don't want any more night-vision footage of james franco adjusting his nuts. We'll go back to my van. show me what you got. "Let's go back to my van: The vinnie van lowe story." think, vinnie. 10,000 tequila sunrises ago. oh. Well, if it isn't neptune's very own angela lansbury. You've aged well. I hear you went legit. As it turns out, I am too legit to quit. I need everything you got off bonnie de ville's tablet. Oh, I know not of what you speak. I am just a respectable businessman trying to earn an honest dollar. Give it to me, vinnie. Or I'll tell 50 cent's security team where they can find the guy who posted video of fitty baking lemon cakes while singing "afternoon delight." you know, I can feel you acting like you're not impressed, but you should be happy for me, v mars. I found my calling. Oh, yeah. Nip slips. boozy bar exits. Bad beach bodies. Do you have any idea what people will pay for a shot of a celebrity looking stupid while eating? A lot. I do the circuit. You know, I do the chi chi stores and I do the french preschools. I mean, if you have more than five imdb credits you can't pick a wedgie in your back yard without me finding out a way to get paid. [ Chuckles ] I'm the reason people know that anne hathaway has a vagina. I mean, before that, you know, they thought, "yeah, maybe." but they didn't know. [ Whistles ] 256 gigs. nice. Anyway, you'll like this. I stuffed 30 tablets into those mtv gift bags. You want to know my return on investment? Nope. no, I don't. You're legal now, right? We should go out sometime. Yuck. all right. Your loss. Hey, fyi: Bonnie de ville? Her video feed ends the night she dies. It's motion-detected so, you know, there's not a lot of motion postmortem. Good seeing ya, veronica. This isn't gonna be easy to watch. It's all the video vinnie captured off the tablet camera. Hey! you're such a punk-ass bitch. you want this... in your face? no, I really don't. do you not? [ chuckling] no. speak, girl! Speak! you can do it! Speak! [ dog barks ] And this is the day she died. Hey, it's carrie. we're going out tonight. gia did say she was at carrie's house that day. [ Cellphone vibrates ] Wait, what is that? where are we now? Recognize this? She's at the 09er. And check out the timestamp. 12:32. That's when I got the text from carrie saying she needed my help. Carrie didn't send you that text. Gia did. Right here. from carrie's tablet. It was gia trying to get you to show up at carrie's house. I know what happened. Iamb: Nice hat. Irony. How's that working out for ya? No irony here. Free hug. anytime, anywhere. Pass. Sacks said you had something I'd be interested in. I'm assuming it's a signed confession. How was carrie's time of death determined? Quickly. Guards at the security gate checked logan in at 1:15 a.m. carrie's alarm went off at 1:21. They showed up. found her dead at 1:31. Time of death sometime between 1:21 and 1:31. Carrie was dead long before that. Gia goodman was over there earlier. Guards checked her out at 3:00 p.m. many people, including free hugs over here, spoke to carrie after that. we have phone records. Carrie was alive when gia left, but gia didn't go alone. Her son-of-a-congressman fiancé went with her. Probably in the trunk. When gia left, she simply left a door or a window open for luke. He waited for his opportunity. After he did the deed, he grabbed carrie's tablet and he changed the alarm code all carrie's friends knew. He shows up at the 09er, establishing a very public alibi. Carrie's friends knew logan and carrie were always fighting about her partying. Gia sent a text she knew would get logan to show up. I suppose they murdered her for kicks. I know how painfully boring these rich kids' lives are. They murdered carrie because they were convinced she was cracking. Something terrible happened on carrie's dad's boat nine years ago. Something worth killing carrie to keep secret. Look at these photos. This one was taken the morning after susan knight disappeared. No anchor. They used it to weigh the body down. Where'd you get these official police photos? Maybe she's friends with martina vasquez? I'm gonna enjoy seeing that smirk disappear when that jury foreman hands down a life sentence. Hey. you want to know a secret? I don't give a shit. I don't care if logan ain't the guy. America thinks he's guilty, and that's good enough for me. Now get the hell out of my office. Man: Oh, there he is. Hey. [ Cellphone rings ] [ Siren wails ] [ Chuckles ] I believe the captain told you that the use of cellphones was prohibited. [ Chuckles ] I'm not on the plane. Yeah, I gathered. I really want to be there with you. There's [sighs] just so much going on here right now. I just... i couldn't leave. Sure you could. Okay. Could you maybe try and understand why I chose not to. I completely understand. That's why I think it's time for us to just... just walk away. Wait, no, that's not what this is. I mean, that's not what I want. Veronica, I'm standing outside of a hotel with my parents who flew to new york mostly to meet you. So, that loyalty, or friendship or whatever it is that made you have to stay in neptune, I wish that same feeling made you get on the plane today. Look, I gotta go let my mom off the hook, okay? She's concerned that her blowout's gonna flatten before you get here. Piz. I'm... i'm really sor... yeah. Okay. Okay, goodbye, veronica. [ Beep ] ♪ Go down in a cloud of mercury ♪ [ Beep ] [ Sighs ] Logan's coming over to talk about the case. Please be nice. What? I'm over 21. Truman-mann left a message. Apparently, they left several on your cell but never heard back. Okay. I'll give 'em a call. thanks. Yeah. No need. They said they were moving on without ya. They needed someone a little more "motivated," I think it was. or "dedicated." I saved the message. The gist was they wanted someone who cared enough to return a call. [ Sighs ] You worked so hard for so long. And just like that you're throwing it away? For what? [ Cellphone rings ] [ Beep ] This is keith. Just give me two minutes. okay? All right. Bye. [ Beep ] [ Sighs ] I'm gonna... i'll be right back. [ Sighs ] [ Siren wails ] Deputy. I guess I picked the wrong week to quit smoking. You know I saw this thing on, uh, youtube a few weeks ago, keith. It's a funny video. Uh, two nazi officers, they're looking at the skulls on their insignias. The piles of dead bodies. And they have this moment of clarity. "Wait a minute. we're the bad guys." if you were a bad guy, jerry, you wouldn't be here now. Iamb, he's just a puppet. Everyone is on the take. That gun they planted on the navarro kid, I checked that into evidence myself. And that's just the tip of iceberg. And you'll testify to that fact? [ Door squeaks open ] We've gotta move.

No. open your eyes! Open your eyes, dad! wake up! It's veronica! Call for an ambulance, now! Miss mars. [ sighs ] Your father has some pretty serious injuries. He has fractures of the ribs, skull and pelvis. We're gonna have to keep him in the icu. When can I see him? It'll probably be a couple of days. And sacks? the other man in the car?

Hey, it's carrie. you're such a punk-ass bitch. speak, girl! Speak! [ beep ] [ Sighs ] Hey. something's happening. You need to get over here right away. [ Beep ] Hey. Veronica: I've made the call to gia. She immediately freaked out and called her partner in crime. Have you seen luke pick up? I can't actually see luke right now. Apparently, he had to make a pit stop for some hot man-on-man action. What are you talking about? Luke is inside a west hollywood bathhouse. What's he doing at... oh. Hold on. Someone's at her door. So I just got this call from this... this random number and... it's cobb. and it was carrie's voice. she called cobb for help. Why? Does she need someone to empty her cat box? Shh. Shh. Cobb: Someone is just messing with you. I know. I mean, it's probably that nosy bitch, veronica mars. [ scoffs ] it's called "curiosity." you need to relax, gia. just relax. no freaking way. Update, please. Yeah, gia and cobb are totally about to do it. Are you serious? Gia seduced her lapdog into killing carrie. Can you see them? No, thank god. [ Gia and cobb moaning] ugh. [ Radio static ] shit. What's going on? Dad had all the good listening devices locked up. I had to use one of the old bugs that uses fm signal. It's a bandwidth at the end of the dial no one uses. 88.6. As in "88.6 rock hard rock?" tell me you're joking. Neptune's new classic rock station. All right. probably okay. The bug only transmits 100 yards or so. I should be able to get away with it. Was carrie's tablet one of the big ones or the little ones? Naw, it was a little white one. There is one matching that description on gia's table. She'd have to be stupid to keep it there. I sat behind her in algebra. Nothing would shock me. Well, carrie's was inscribed. It was like: "rock you very much from the mtv music awards," something like that. I need to get a closer look. Veronica. I'm not gonna break in. I'm just gonna drop by for a hang. She could be a murderer. Child, please. It's gia goodman. The day I can't handle gia goodman. The four minutes of sex I could hear just fine. the mike couldn't pick up the last 20 minutes of pillow talk or whatever has gone on in that bedroom. [ cat meows ] Hi, kitty. Veronica. hi. That look is making me think you didn't mean it when you said come by and hang. [ Chuckles ] no, I meant it. Come on in. come in. Oh, wow! Do you like your little tablet? I mean, I have the... the big one, but this is sure cute, isn't it? Well, cute only gets you so far in life. Am I right? All right! I'm sorry. what? My regularly scheduled programming was preempted by the sound of you getting your rocks off, hoss. You really wanted that poor girl to say your name. What are you talking about? [ Radio tuning ] Veronica: "rock you very much." where'd you get this? gia: Carrie was always giving away her swag. so, what are you really doing here? what do you mean? well, I'm not stupid. I know you didn't come by to hang out. so, come on. what's eating veronica mars? oh, yeah. That. [ Sighs ] I'm pretty sure you murdered carrie bishop because she was on the verge of telling the truth about what happened with susan knight nine years ago. [ laughs ] You are an insane person. I was in the 09er. everyone saw me. You're right. I misspoke. You didn't kill her. You used your lady parts to get stu cobbler to do it for you. [ Chuckles ] don't be gross. I just watched you from across the street, gia. I have pictures. If I had any facebook friends, they'd be enjoying them already. I'd say, "wait till your fiancé finds out." but I'm gonna go ahead and guess he's okay with it. You are protecting his bright future, right? I mean, there are beards and then there are beards that go the extra mile. I was at the 09er. there are witnesses. Everybody saw me. Gia. Keep up. We're past that now. I believe you. I even have proof you were there. Timestamped video. And right about now it's dawning on you where this video came from. The camera on carrie's tablet. Cobb took the tablet from carrie's house after he killed her. Here you are typing out the text that'll get logan over to carrie's. I think the sheriff is gonna be very interested in this video. Do you even remember cobb from high school? Just this total trailer park weirdo. The creepy guy who sat behind me in civics reading guns & camouflage or whatever. Eye-screwing me and smelling like old sponge. He had the good drugs, though. That night that we went out on carrie's boat we tried to hit him up for product. But he insisted on us taking him with. We got so shit faced it didn't really matter. But then, susan, as usual, bottoms out. She starts bawling about the baby that she gave up for adoption. She disappears below deck. Carrie found her later and she was barely breathing. But cobb says that she'd sleep it off. 'Cause he'd seen it a hundred times before. And you believed him. We were out of our skulls. We were picturing jail time. Lost futures. lost fortunes. And then carrie went down to check on susan later. She was dead. Just full-on dead. [ Sighs ] And it was cobb's idea to weigh her down with an anchor. Then we're all sobbing and we're trying to lift her body over the side of the boat. Dick was sobbing. Dick passed out before any of this even happened. He never knew the truth. He sells the lie better than any of us. But none of us even noticed that cobb wasn't helping us push susan's body overboard. later, after all the police-grilling and media stuff, carrie, luke and I get emailed a camera phone photo of us dumping susan's body. And he's owned us ever since. We bankroll him. we pal around with him. You sleep with him. Yeah, lucky me. I'm the one he loves. He flashes the photo any time he thinks one of us needs a reminder. Carrie needed a lot of reminders. He rented the apartment across the street so that he can see me whenever he wants to. I'm not even allowed to have curtains. He's probably watching us right now.
