PACO: Besides, you have your right arm tied to your back. Do you think you have any chance? No. Zsolt is my right arm. And you are my left arm. I need you to free Zsolt.

With my money. For sure, now he doesn't want to escape arrest because he knows he will face me. And I'll kill him. That means that we need to kidnap him. I'll think about the plan to end his days, but until then... I wanted to let you know that Zsolt's share is for one million. I want to give it to you. Thank you. CRISTI: And Gilda? Do you want her share too? CRISTI: No. What will happen to her? (SCOFFS) I don't know yet. She tried to scam me too. (BIRDS TWEETING) - Finished? - Yes. Okay, let's go. (ENGINE REVVING) The plan is simple. In this vial, there is a substance with no color, smell or taste. You dissolve it in a glass of water. Nobody will notice. You'll give it to Zsolt, to drink it, and he will feel sick. Then, you call for an ambulance, and he will be taken to the hospital. The vial takes effect within half an hour. And after that, within another half hour, the doctor will have to give him an injection of cortisone. Otherwise, he will die. Any ambulance has cortisone. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hello.

You whistle in Romanian for Gilda. She whistles in Spanish for Kiko, and Kiko whistles back to me. That way, we check that the message is correct. Come on. PACO: Let's imagine we are in Bucharest. PACO: You gave the vial to Zsolt, and he was taken to the hospital. Now, we are in the hospital. You whistle that Zsolt is in room 3, floor 7, and he's guarded by two cops.
