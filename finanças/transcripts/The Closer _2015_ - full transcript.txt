Sarge and I have got this sweet gig man, you'd be perfect for it. No. Thanks, man. But I'm not really looking for a job right now. What? You're making a lot of money surfing? What are you, like really good? All point break and shit. [LAUGHS] Is that your bag? Yeah. Good, you're coming with me. No. I've really... And I'm not taking no for an answer, you know me. [EXCLAIMING EXCITEDLY] Fuck! Wait till Sarge sees you man. It's been too long brother, come on, lets go. [ENGINE REVS] Morning, Steven. Messages? No. Let me see you in my office. Sure Everybody ready to go? Yes, sir. Got the whole conference room going and everything like that? Yes, I do, mm-hmm. Hey, Kim. How long is this gonna take? 'Cause it's... really boring.

Sure. Settle down, bitches. It's Glengarry time. It's 10:00 a.m sharp and sharp is what I need you to be. STEVEN: There are two kind of people in this world. The men who walk the walk. And the loser who talk the talk. Let me tell you something. Yesterday I was in need of a morale boost. And I ain't talking about no blow job. So I went down the block and I bought myself a new toy. That toy, ladies, is parked outside. You know how much that toy costs? Hundred large. It's all paid for too, in cash. That's what it takes to be the man. Hell, those Wall Street motherfuckers, Ivy League punks do it everyday. They do it all day. I'm the man. And you? You are nothing but a bunch of fucking wannabes. STEVEN: But you can be the man too. Only if you believe that every goddamn John Smith or Jane fuckin' Doe that walks in here is nothing but a big fat dollar sign to you. You gotta make the sale. Read the papers, watch the news. Real Estate's the new game in town. Everybody wants in on the action. Everybody wants a piece of the American Pie. Don't let them waste your time. Always be closing. ALL: Always be closing. Always be closing! [BANGS ON TABLE] Always be closing! What the fuck did I just say? ALL: [SCREAMING] Always be closing. Otherwise, your going to be wasting my time. And that's something you don't ever... want to do. [YELLING] What the fuck are you waiting for? Go get me the juice, motherfuckers! Go! [MOBILE RINGS] Stu, I need a loan closed. STU: I know, dipshit. But I can't do anything right now. Listen, you didn't hear me. I need the damn loan closed. The buyer's going to lose her patience, she's going to get cold feet. You've got to close the loan. STU: You're not hearing me. I have a problem with her debt income ratios. She needs to show more income, without it, I can't do anything Hello? Then I'll fix it. [CAR LOCK TONE] STEVEN: Stu, listen, you gotta close that loan tomorrow. Stu? Look, she's gonna lose her patience, you gotta close the loan. STU: Yes, we're closing tomorrow. [LAUGHS SMUGLY] Son of a bitch, I wonder how you got her to... Never mind, I don't want to know. STU: Hey. This one's for you. You ever heard of mortgage securities? No. STU: Mortgage securities are Wall Streets new trend. Those greedy sons of bitches finally found a way to get in on the party [LAUGHS]. They are buying up all the loans I'm generating. Fucking geniuses, I'm telling you. The money that they are borrowing is so cheap, that they're buying my files, and bonding those loans, selling them to the big financial institutions, tripling the profits. And get this, they want fuckin' everything. All FICO's. 660's, 620's, even 580's. Stu, you know what this means, right? Now's our time to make the money. [LAUGHS] STU: Hey, check this out. STEVEN: What a fuckin' beauty, huh? STEVEN: How much? 75k a month. And you don't have to deal with the bullshit at the airports anymore. I love this shit. I want in. Thanks for letting me stay on your couch last night. Are you kiddin' me? Anything for you, bro. Are you sure its all right with Carol? I don't want to get between you two. You know better than that, Carol's fine with it. Our house is like a fuckin' hostel. We got people staying all the time. Not that you're not special. I see she's got you dressed in one of my shirts. Yeah, she does a good job dressing me. Just make sure you give it back. And start making your own money. Yeah, shit out of luck on that one. How's Sarge? Still a crazy motherfucker. I'll tell you what though. That crazy motherfucker saved my life is some many ways by hooking me up with this gig. I was driving a fuckin' truck up in the Bronx, for Christs sake. Fuckin' waste of time that was. Do you ever think about Tommy? [GUN FIRES] I've been thinking a lot about him lately. I just keep playing that scene over and over again in my head, you know. Yeah, fuck that. I don't want to talk about this. Sarge doesn't like talking about it too much either. I think he feels he owes you for what you did back there. Listen, all I'm saying is, he'd love to have you come in on this gig, you know? I mean, how the hell are you guys making money out here anyways? That's simple really. Banks have got these properties they can't sell. They always use the same brokers to sell their shitty houses. And that, my friend, is where we come in. Cash buyers, baby. We get these houses at a kickass rate, man. Say like, forty cents on the dollar. Then we sink some money into them, renovate them. Sell them at top dollar. Why wouldn't these idiots buyers buy directly from the banks themselves. They can't. These houses are in terrible fuckin' shape, man. They got not working kitchens, bathrooms. They're never going to qualify for a mortgage in this state. They're not in the construction industry, we are. We fix them up, so you see, the buyers have to buy it from us. This is a sweet fuckin' deal. [RAP SONG PLAYING] Oh, shit! [LAUGHS] My man! Take a seat, my man. Surfer boy. Sexy, come here. Oh, you are sexy. Do me a favor. My surfer boy here. get him a Blue Label, would you? You know, if it wasn't for this son of a bitch, I wouldn't be here right now. Watch it, surfer boy. She's mine. Ha, dream on, big boy. What? How long you in town for, brother, huh? Not long. My mom passed, so I'm just... Hey. [RAP SONG CONTINUES] Sorry, man. Listen... Why don't you take a rid with me tomorrow, okay? Sure. My man. Hey. To us. Come here. You want a hit? You want some of this? No. This is good stuff right here. No, I'm good. Come here, baby. Give me a little something, right here. Alex, get me some. What do you want, baby boy? [SNORTING] [DOOR OPENS] Son of a bitch, get the fuck up. What are you fucking doing? [LAUGHS] [SCREAMS] Get the fuck up! Get the fuck up! What the fuck are you doing?
