THE WIDE BLUE ROAD This is the best season for fishing. In September the fish leave the depths and run close to the shore where the water is still warm and the seaweed is tender and sweet. These are my islands. I know them well... every reef, ev ery cove, every inch of the ocean bottom. Only one man in the village knows how to fish like me. Salvatore. We grew up together, then he went on fishing with nets. Not me! There was another boy we grew up with. Gaspare. How our lives went separate ways! He signed up for the Coast Guard. He has a uniform, state pay. But I like what I do and I have something they don't. Can we help, Papa? Do what? Blow us all up? Stand back, both of you! There now. You can come closer. - Bore? - Here I am, Papa. Sit there and grate. There! Like that. As fine as you can. Tonino, you get the tar ready. Fast. Like cheese. What if it explodes? Why? Does chees explode? This is not an explosive. It has to be fired. Come on, give it to me. Bravo, Bore! Mind your fingers! Is this okay? Better if it were finer. But same thing anyway. Detonators. These explode right away, only need a slight tap. Careful. Scared? There! Coast is clear. Go on, Papa. Stand back! - Nothing. - Quiet. There they are! Sea bream, Papa! Sea bream, Squarcio! That's right, kids! My bombs never miss. Quick, Tonino! Jump in! How many, Papa? Here! Grab this big one! Great! It weighs six kilos. Mamma mia! Give it here! What are you up to? Throwing 'em away? I don't throw 'em away, I eat 'em. - Greetings, Salvatore! - Greetings, Squarcio! How's it going? Not much... hope other nets... Good luck! - H e's making fun of us. - Why's he doing that? He can't hurt us six hours away at sea. Right! Stick up for a friend. What's that mean? Friendship doesn't come into it. Gaspare grew up with us too, and yet... The first officer? What do you want him to do? Calm down! He'll arrest him if he gets a chance. Domenico! Hi, Squarcio! See what I'v e got here! You want some? Why are you so full of laughs? A pay raise? I know. 800 lire isn't much. But I don't sell fuses or TNT! Too bad! I wanted to make you rich. Don't worry! I'm just fine! Neither rich nor in jail! Good luck then. It's great to have an honest friend. Good luck to you too! Next time, try me again. You never know. Ciao! Good luck! Ciao! Out come the rabbits in love... Wait! Let's both unload. Here. Ciao, Salvatore! Hi, Santamaria! Wait. Hey, Grandpa. Want a hand? No need. Forget it! What did I do? It's your father. You know damn well why. I've got my reasons. Hi, Santamaria. Hi, First Officer. - Hello. - Hi. - Hey, Salvatore. - Hello, Gaspare! Sardines again, eh? Yes, look, they're bigger today. You want some? First weigh 'em, then tell me how much. Forget it, Gaspare! Not worth it. Okay, no deal. Okay, you'll pay for it. I'll send them home. Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Pull, Zerro, pull! Good catch? Sea bream and yellowtail tuna. And you, Santamaria? We didn't sail. Stopped... The cops! Aren't these great, Gaspare? Can I offer? No, it stinks! That's strange! It's the freshest catch. A burnt smell! Ah, I haven't done dynamite fishing for 20 y ears. Yeah, right! Who's stopping you? Shut up! A violation as you speak! Thank God, I never caught you in the act. If it weren't for the law on catching people red-handed, I'd have made you change jobs. Why not tell the law? Yeah. Easy for you. You're trouble! Who asked you to wear that uniform? If you want a new job there's always space on my boat. Do the same for me? Going to see what's up. I'll make you eat it raw! Eat it raw! All right, Tommaso Fiore. Remember who gave you bread after you wrecked your boat? - I paid you back! - Right! Die of hunger next time. Natale won't give you a dime! And you guys? You forget when I bailed you out? I mean all of you! Not all! Such big talk, Salvatore? Set up your Co-op. Go buy another fridge. Tough guys! Up against me. When the west wind keeps you ashore for a month or so, don't come to Natale. I won't give you a dime. Let's talk another time. How much, the sardines? Not the old price. They don't sell on the mainland. They even eat shark! Think it's good! So, how much? Big and small. 45 lire a kilo. Better the yrot! Agreed? Really? Let's see, Natale. Let's see what we can do. Give it a try! No fear, it won't ruin you. You've gotten fat on us the last 10 y ears. Sea bream or yellowtail tuna for the mainland bigwigs. - Put them inside, meantime. - No! All or nothing! - But I'm buying. - Bravo. At a fair price, right? What do you care? Nothing. Just busting your balls. It's not good for you! Maybe! Go ahead! Let the first come in... Start making change. - Thanks, Squarcio. - Thanks for what? Bore! Tonino! Diana! Rosetta! - What did you bring? - A surprise! Let's see! Let's see, Squarcio! His name's Papa, not Squarcio. Leave him! Let' em think we're brothers! Diana... to the kitchen. - I want to see the surprise. - More madness? Bought it especially for you, Rosetta. It's always for me, when you buy what you want. Give me the scissors, Tonino. - Here they are. - Thanks. Hands off! From a Frenchman on the black market. Wonder how much you paid? - How does it work? - I know how it works. You do? Go on then... Be careful, though! Where's the cord? No power... It works on batteries. Great, he y? Rosetta, wine for everyone! Not Bore, it's bad for him. No, it's not! Want to see me drink a whole bottle? Six months since a catch like this. Happy? Tomorrow we'll celebrate. Listen to Mass on the radio. And then, let's go out. You want to keep me home for Mass? - Only for your sake, Rosetta. - I know... Change the station! Seas: Ligurian, upper and central Tyrrhenian... northern and central Adriatic light swells... southern Tyrrhenian, Sardinian, and Sicilian... lonian, lower Adriatic, swells, rough in places, waves... What are you doing here? Why'd you come? Go away! Diana! No, no, Domenico. Please, dear, let me go! Why? I love you, you know. I love you too so much. But I swore we wouldn't do it again. I'm ashamed, Domenico. But what's wrong, Diana? Now you're crying? It happens when you love each other. It happens to everyone. Yes, but after they're married. And we aren't getting married? Will you really marry me, Domenico? Yes. I want to marry you. Diana! Leave my brother alone! He's smaller than you! Coward! Stop it! Have you gone crazy? Tonino, you don't know. We're getting married. He swore he'd marry me. Is that so? Yes, I want to marry her. See me kill you if you don't! Don't tell Squarcio. Domenico. Poor Domenico. You love me, right? - Yes. - Yes. Love. And no special leave! No girlfriends! No weddings! No funerals! Nothing, no way! Not one. Not one of them caught in the act. - Actually... - Well, two! But in how many years? Look at this. Fishermen's protests, certified letters, reprimands from H Q. How can I catch such fast boats? And they ev en threaten a transfer. Enough! From tomorrow morning, do a search. Every island! Rock by rock! Bush by bush! It's time to put a stop to this! As for me, you can stay a month. But it's not as if that'll change the situation. Not even a miracle will re-open the quarry. Listen to me, go back home. But how do you want me to say it? Shipping costs are too high. Can't work. What are you waiting for? You've already been fired. Do as you please! What can I say? Domenico! Why haven't you come by lately? We've been here day and night. They said it would re-open. What are you going to do? Go back to the mainland? I'v e got a plan for the beginning. I must speak to your father. - You're staying here then? - Yes, I won't leave you. See, First Officer, I went right over it without noticing. Look. Fuses, gunpowder, sticks and detonators. A detonator for every stick of TNT. That's it! This time Squarcio pays! Back to the station, early tomorrow, 6:00 a. m. Don't forget! Let me stay, First Officer! Tomorrow morning, I said. One of us is enough. Thanks, Santucci. Now, go away! If one of us is spotted, all will be ruined. Go! Stop! Halt! Squarcio, I can identify you. Wait, Squarcio. Let's talk! Stop! Stop! Squarcio! You don't shoot on sight! It was an accident, Squarcio. It wasn't me. An unfortunate accident. An accident. Tomorrow, we fish our catch for his mother. How do I come into it? Domenico stole for you. Not for me or anyone else. H e stole because the quarry closed. He nev er wanted to before. He was a good kid. So you think. But I don't come into it. Yes, you do! I guarantee it'll suit you! Come on. Let's go. Just a drop. No. I'm tired. I need to go sleep. Huh? And not clear the table? - Let me do it! - Only take a minute. - Right, Diana? - Yes, Papa. And you, where're you going? Staying right here. Must mend the net. You like fishing with that better? Yeah, I know, it brings in too little. How about you, Bore? - Bore! - H e y! Good night. Bad day, today. - You knew him? - Saw him, a few times. Was a good kid, Domenico. Honest... If only he hadn't been fired. TNT's no use in a dead quarry. He had to get a bit of money, poor boy. That's certainly what he was thinking, no? What are you doing? For the mosquitos. It was no one's fault. Not even Gaspare's. Life is so difficult, getting married and having children, getting them a life. Yes, that's why so many things happen. Pick yourself up! Let's go for a walk. Strong wind. Tomorrow's going to be a hell of a day. To the Commander at Naviglio di Montfalcone Station, Re: Request for discharge. On the 18th of this month, my renewal comes due... First Officer, they are dynamite fishing. Right close by! Next line. Since I do not intend to stay long term in the Coast Guard, please consider my resignation effective as of the abov e date. I await a decision from my superior officers and my replacement as Squad Commander. Signed, First Officer Gaspare Puggioni. - Send it off right away. - At your command, First Officer. Have a good trip! - Gaspare! - H i, Squarcio. Good day. They told me at the station you're leaving. When's your replacement arriving? Should be here today. In any event, I'v e handed over my post. - What will you do now? - Don't know. Don't know yet. Well, if you need something... No thanks. H e y, don't be offended! We grew up together. Friends, right? A loan. No rules and regulations now. Just the same, Squarcio. Thanks. All aboard! - Ciao. - Ciao, Gaspare. Good luck. Goodbye, Squarcio. Thanks for coming. Goodbye, Gaspare. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. First Officer Puggioni! That boat belongs to the Coast Guard. Right? Yes, I think so. Great boat! I've never seen one like it. Not in these waters. No, me neither. Not around here. Ready for the army but he can't swim? That's really shameful! And he thinks he's brave. I'm not afraid of anything! Don't run away, come here! No more big talk, eh? Hurry up. Down you go! Well, how's it going? Like it? A lot. Very good. Bravo. So I'll tow you then. Fine, but let me take a short break. Papa, the Coast Guard! Look how fast they go! Quick, everything overboard! Even the roll of fuse wire! Tonino, overboard, quick! Finished? Bravo, bravissimo! Move! Hurry, hurry! Stop! There they are! That's Squarcio. Here they come, boys. Smile and play it cool. Welcome, First Officer. What's up? Need some help? No thanks. Getting to know you... This is me. Like what you see? When did you start being so disrespectful? Since officers started being rude to fishermen. All right, mutual respect. Allow me to see one of those fish, please. Don't joke around. That one, quick! How did you get such a big catch? With a golden hook. Look! This one's got a broken spine. Poor guy! Must have crashed into a rock. Maybe I caught it already dead. Evidence enough. If an explosion had been heard, you'd have spent the night in jail. Not sleep too well there, right? Well enough. We'll meet again, Balzano. Let's move it! See you again soon! Cheers, Chief! In fact, it's natural. One first officer goes, another comes. Except this one's got a motorboat. Have you ever seen such a moustache? Bet it'll do 10 knots. I'm fit to bust with laughter. Now for the dynamite fishermen! Quite the comic, your son, Salvatore. Beware of overkill though! Overkill? Time you stopped making jokes about men who work. Why, perhaps... do I live off interest income? Worse. With you it's like walking into a bank to blow up the safe. - Only the sea is everybody's. - Exactly right. - It's not only yours. - You can profit too. Who's stopping you? What are you afraid of? The Coast Guard? Or dynamite? If everyone fished like you, there'd be nothing left in a year. I don't fish close to the islands. You know damn well I don't interfere with anyone. That's the only reason we still speak to you. You couldn't s end Bore or Tonino? They haven't gotten back yet. All right, I'll pay. Rush home now. What did you want to tell me? The new first officer with his motorboat. - Well, what's he done? - H e's arrested Zerro. You know, I always drop by your house when I go fishing. Thought I'd like to say hello. See? I'v e put your name on my boat. A fine name, not like any other. Everybody uses the names of saints. Not us. Ours is called "Speranza. " But "Diana" is the best of all, don't you think? - How old are you? - 16. I'm 19. Some other evening, I'll drop by again if that's okay with you. Here's your father. You'll be happy now. Stay under the covers. How'd it go? Nothing again today. What's wrong with Bore? A bit of a sore throat. Nothing serious. Ever since he got here, he's been after me! Wherever I go, I trip over him. - How do you feel? - Fine. It was a miracle he didn't lay a hand on us. If Papa didn't know a strait via the shoals... Diana, I'm thirsty! What's his temperature? 101. I'v e just taken it. Take it again! I bought it from a peasant who made it hims elf. - Squarcio. - What do you want? Now that we have a home... Well? ...you could go back to fishing with nets. Yes and then? We want to start over? I'd rather die! Yeah, with nets! Catch only enough not to starve each day! Then you get a year like that one... two months, one after the other, without being able to set sail, NO ADVAN CE S... A year like that and you vanish, if you have no savings. It was at the end of that winter that my mother died. I promised to marry you but I'd rather not do it than make you live like my mother did... like all the women of the islands. If I marry you, you have to have a happy life, Rosetta. Happy at any price! And now I have to give it all up! Everything I built? My family? For First Officer Riva? Are you okay, Rosetta? Yes, Squarcio. Fine. Everything's fine! Sometimes a guy thinks he's made a mistake. Happy, Rosetta? We have a home, and three healthy, strong children. All things that cost money. Then Diana will get married and she too will have children. Will you be upset if Diana gets married? Why should I be upset? I'll also be happy if she gets married. You shouldn't worry, Rosetta. I'll think of something, you'll see! The motor, Squarcio. The motor! The new motor! Bore! The new motor! - The new motor has arrived! - Watch out! Look, Tonino! Hav e you seen how many crates? Accountant Carlo Festucci. Squarcio, Giovanni Balzano - Pleased to meet you. - He couldn't find his way here. - Tonino? - Yes, Papa. Run and fetch my tools. Bore... - Sorry, Signor Balzano, first... - Yes, money. Go get cash from Mamma, now! Here are the promissory notes. - Where? - Here. You'll assemble it at once? Sure. - On your own? - Sure. You know how? - Here it is, Papa. - Put it there. Here. The old motor is all yours. Did you see? We have to pay all those notes? With a motor like this... I can sail no matter the weather. Let's drink to the motor! I thought we'd stopped dynamite fishing. No, you hear? He'll never stop. No one will ever get him to stop. That's for sure. Isn't that Salvatore's son? What does he want with our sister? H e y! What d'you want with Diana? Go on boys, to bed. It's 10:00 p. m. But I'm not very sleepy. He won't catch me! Let him chase me now! Let's drink to the motor! Let's drink to Zerro! Sooner or later, we'll all end up the same way. Me, I'm changing jobs. Afraid? Yes. d When the moon is full d d When the night is silent d d Out into the fields d d Come the rabbits in love... d Look, my hands are shaking. That's natural, Santamaria. You're old. Natural. Ev erything's natural to you! Even if a guy dies, that's natural. Even if it's your fault, like with Domenico. You shouldn't have said that. You oughtn't say that! Leave me alone, I said! Who's touching you? Get lost! Take me along, Squarcio. I'm old. Let's be partners. Give me what you like. I don't want a partner. Go back to your son. I can't. It's too late. He doesn't want me anymore. Salvatore doesn't want me. d I can nev er forget that I'm in love... d Look who's there. Watch this! Don't do anything rash, Squarcio. No, it's only for fun. Accelerate! Full speed ahead! Nothing doing! See, Rosetta? We're going at least two knots faster. The megaphone! Here! H e y! Speranza! Stop! Get alongside. Easy now. Don't worry. Nothing'll happen. Morning, First Officer. May I? I'd like to introduce my wife. This is First Officer Riv a. My wife Rosetta. - Nice to meet you. - My pleasure. Congratulations. You've bought a new motor? How fast does it go? You didn't see? At the very least two knots faster than yours. No one ev er dropped bombs inland near the islands. - On your orders? - Sure. Full speed ahead! Signora! We'll meet again, Balzano. Grab hold of the rudder! Turn away! Turn away, Rosetta, for pity's sake! Don't look! It's nothing. It's just a wound. Squarcio, my hand! Hurry! - Grit your teeth. You see? I told you. I'm no good for anything anymore. Calm down, Santamaria. My son will have me at home now, right? Certainly, certainly he will. Easy now... pull up alongside. Take the boat in tow. Get him on board. Quick! Quick! You made everything vanish, eh? I didn't touch a thing. Let's hear what happened striking a match. I wasn't here. - Ready, Commander. - Dire ctly into harbor. Come now, don't cry. Santamaria was old. His hands trembled. That'll never happen to me. Squarcio, it's enough. I beg you, I beg you... I swear. Away, Rosetta, stop! I tell you it's nothing serious. He'll make a good recovery, you'll see. It's an old story. Since he was a boy, he'd leav e the house and... once a dynamite fisherman, always... even if he is my father. But he's wounded now. He's out of danger. Didn't you hear what they said at the hospital? He'll manage to avoid prison. The boat will be auctioned. - How's it going this year? - Bad. Natale still gets his price. But I think there'll soon be another fridge on the island. - The Co-op? - Certainly. Need any help, I know wholesalers on the mainland... Genoa, La Spezia... Thanks, First Officer. But remember, there'll always be dynamite fishermen. Listen, why don't we give each other a hand? Each to his own, First Officer. Would you come drag in nets with us? Fair enough. Goodbye. Let's go to Campana Point. Yeah, to fish for stones. How so? Because it's September, the fish are on the move. Let's go to Saracen Cove then. Sure, to gather clams. Okay, let's go where you want. There he is, Commander. Good! This time he won't get away! Half speed. Stay sheltered from the wind. Stay as close to the coast as possible. Papa, how's it going? Look! Want me to come down there? No, go back to your post! Ahead, keep going ahead! No depth, Commander. Don't worry. Stick to the coast. The first officer, Papa. The first officer! How far away? - Not quite a mile. - Start the motor, Papa? It's us eless. The y'll find us... at the mouth of the inlet. Quick. Tie everything down. The oars, the nets, everything... everything that floats. You hear? Quick! Don't forget a thing! It doesn't matter about the knots. Quick! Hurry! Hurry! Quick! He's close. He's almost here! Remember the landmarks, that rock down there, the mouth of the bay, that high crag with yellow moss... okay? Why don't you get the motor running? Remember, this is where Speranza goes down. Now jump in! What are you doing, Squarcio? Why don't you start the motor? Move it! - And you? - Go! Jump, Papa! What are you doing? Easy now. Slow down. Did we miss them leaving? Turn back. Full speed! Got a cigarette, Squarcio? It's clearing up. Let's hope... it's time. Nylon line is better. No, dynamite is better. Nylon costs too much. Well? Nothing doing. I talked with that guy from Montefalcone. H e also won't go down 90 feet without a diving suit. If you find someone, I'll lend you the boat whenever. But it's difficult. Everyone is busy saving their own skins. Squarcio, take notice of what I say. Quit now! Know what I do now? I sell cheese. I'm in much better shape. - Even the boat's up for auction. - Poor Santamaria! Balzano... where's your boat? I lent it out. - Know what I regret? - What? I'm sorry there's no deep-sea diver on the island. Yes, Chief. A real shame! We could do with a diver. See you, Chief. Hope so. Ciao, I was looking for you. Ciao, Salvatore. - Have something to drink? - Yes. A bottle. Listen up... a laughing matter! H e's got it bad for your daughter. - I will marry her! - Hear that? H e'll marry her. What do you think? Me? I say he's a fool. I said the same. H e's 20! - You'll ruin yours elf, son. - That's my business. Well? I told you. If she agrees... I'll go and tell her. Ever s een such a frenzy? Let's giv e them a hand and get them married at once. At once? No, Salvatore. No, not at once. I don't agree. Let's wait a bit. It's got to be a grand celebration. All right. There's no hurry. I'v e been meaning to say this for a while... if you agree, we could be together like before, 50/50. Poverty again, going 50/50. You'll see. Things will be better. Soon we'll also have a fridge. I'm not the Co-op type. Unless you need a dynamite fisherman. As you wish. I'll pick up the tab for the wine. Ciao! Be seeing you... I told you, I can't accept. Thanks, Renato, but I can't. Thanks so much. You're in love with someone else? No, it's not for that reason. Because... I'm not who you think I am. What do you mean? You s ee, he wasn't like us. H e was from the mainland. He made it all sound so simple. It s eemed as if there was nothing wrong. He would'v e married me, however. I'm sure of that! I have to go home now. What a pity. I liked you when you came by to say hello. Diana! Listen. Stop, Diana. I'll marry you all the same! It's all the same to me! I want to marry you! Meanwhile, I'll start taking inv entory. And then I'll talk to your husband. No, wait! Won't you take a drop? No, thank you. One table, one radio, one sideboard, one night-fishing lamp, one cast-iron stove. - All in excellent condition. - Wait, I beg you! It's not my fault if the notes weren't honored. Notes s e cured by property, ma'am. - One sewing machine. - No, please. Not this! One sewing machine in good condition. What year? - Didn't you hear my mother? - Stop it, Tonino. Please, signore! It was a gift from my husband two years ago. What's going on? What do you want? I don't enter into it. Just following orders. Scram, louse! Get out! Get out! - Okay. Calm down, let's see. - Get out! Listen, wait a moment. Maybe we can cut a deal. H e'll wait a fortnight. Don't worry, Rosetta. Don't worry! They're right close by! Who can it be? Start the motor, Renato. Let's go! Quick, Tonino, quick! H urry! Out! Fast! Stop, Squarcio. It's useless! Let's wait. You go! Quickly! Go away, I said! Take these, they're yours! Your bomb killed them. Take them home! Are you done? Those're ours, on the other hand. We work here, Squarcio, with nets. Take them now. You know you're doing wrong, Squarcio. Why keep on doing it? Come on! Are you afraid? There're fiv e of you. We also worked as a five, Squarcio - Let go! - Watch out! H e might fight back! We know you're in deep trouble but you shouldn't be doing this. - Shut up, you little snot! - Enough already, Squarcio! - Give us those bags! - The sea's ruined. Now you bomb us at home. No fish will be caught for six months, and you know it. Thief! Stop, Squarcio. Stop, you! You'll pay for this. You're dead meat! Cowards! Cowards! You're dead meat! Sorry, children, but your father's doing wrong. Let's go. Slowly... that's the rock, the mouth of the bay... the crag with moss. It's here for sure. Halt! Let's take a look. Why don't you let me try first? I might make it. Okay. Now stay alert, I'm warning you! If any boat comes by, cast your fishing lines. If you hear the Coast Guard's boat, give me a signal, pull on the rope, like this, okay? There he is! Did you make it, Papa? How deep down is the motor? You're tired? Why don't you take a break? The wrench? There he is! H e won't make it! H e won't make it! H e'll get hurt! Tell him, Tonino! Make him stop! Papa! Papa! 73, 74, 75, 76... 91, 92, 93, 94... I did it, boys. I did it, Tonino! - What's up, Papa? - Nothing, it'll pass. - Do you want to drink? - No. Let me sleep now. We have to wait till dark. Attention, signori, please. H e y, did you see that? Your son's here! H e came like all the others, out of curiosity. Just like me! Who cares about the boat! I looked for you everywhere. I need an advance. On what? No, I already told you, Squarcio. Listen! The Co-op's fridge will be running in a few days. No one's going to work anymore to make you fat. I know. So what? You can't imagine how much disgust I feel but I'm the only one willing to fill up your fridge. And how will you go out fishing? Going to swim out there, maybe? I'v e got my motor back again. Nobody bids 40,000 lire? Tiny little boats cost more. Any bids? 40,000? H e can bring the price down, as low as he wants. But if Santamaria doesn't buy his boat back, there'll be no bids. That's how we do things here. - Who bids 30,000? - 30,000. I have a bid of 30,000. You see? You see? No more? Nobody bids more than 30,000? 30,000 going once, 30,000 going twice... 35,000. 37,000. A 24-foot boat, signori. No more bids? 40,000. Can you lend me some money? You got nothing to give me? - Going... going... - 42,000. 42,000, Signori. It's worth a lot more. Courage! 50,000. No more bids? Attention! Going to the highest bidder. - Let's go. - 50,000, signori. H e's leaving. Should I go? Sure, go on! Pleas e, Signori, a moment more. 50,000 going once... 50,000 going twice... gone! Got it? It's ov er with Diana too. Salvatore! Courage, man! Go! Go! Thanks, Salvatore. I'm sorry, but I had no more. I'm sorry too, Grandpa. Thanks... thanks... The boat's not what counts. Come on, let's go. It's always his fault! H e's ruined my life! Look at it! Stop it, Diana! No, that's it! First Domenico, and now Renato. I can't go out with him. He forbids it! And why not? What has he done wrong? Nothing! He just said that he loves me. He only wants to marry me. Come on, Diana. It'll all work out. No! It's not fair. Tonight, he was going to take me dancing. For a month, he's been promising. Everybody's going and I... - Where to? - To the Co-op party. Get yours elf ready. I'll take you. Move it! Get dressed! - But... Papa? - H urry up! I told you, I'll take care of it! - No, Diana. Papa said no! - Papa's wrong! Let's drink to the Co-op! Cheers! Good health! Listen up! Tomorrow morning, 4:00 a. m., we set sail all together! You're drunk, Tommaso. You've already told us four times. Right! Let them dance so they'll fish better tomorrow. Come down! As I said, we'll take the wholesalers' best offer and then we'll see if we should go direct to the market. Even Natale did this. Diana, would you dance with such an old man? Would you hold this? Bravo, bravo, Salvatore. H e y, Salvatore. We're still going strong, eh? H ere, you next. Dancing isn't for me anymore, I'm out of breath. - H e's holding her too tight. - Shut up! You shut up! You'll see what Squarcio says. I could care less. Instead, I do! Don't say again that Papa's in the wrong. - What do you know? - More than you. As soon as we're alone, you'll see. - You want to hit me? - Yes! H e's dead meat, your father! H e y guys, stop that! I fight with father and son and you let her go with them? Diana's in love. Renato is a good boy, you always said so. - And Bore and Tonino? - They went as chaperones. H ere they are! - Did you enjoy yourself? - Yes, Mamma. And you? Don't you like dancing? No. But we had to chaperone Diana. You can sleep well. Mamma told me. - All's agreed. - Thanks, Papa. H urry up, however, becaus e we set sail at 4:00 a. m. Great! At 4:00 a. m., Squarcio. You're going fishing? Yes, you know. Easterly wind, tomorrow will be perfect. An exceptional day! H e couldn't do anything with that boat, don't you think? What's important is that Santamaria is back with his son. Certainly, he'll be happy. In any cas e, I'll give him back his boat as soon as I can. Just a few more trips done well and we'll be on an even keel again. How many more trips, Squarcio? Oh... three, four. We'll finish paying for the motor, get Diana married. And after that? After what? We'll talk about that afterwards! It's 16 y ears, Squarcio, since I married you. For 16 y ears, I'v e been afraid. And you never said anything about it to me? You think it's easy to tell you anything? You know, no one gives you something for nothing. It's natural. Yes, but we've got it all now. A bit of land, the house... Meantime, you still haven't been capable of giving me another son. Still three more trips, you said so yourself. - Fine, we'll discuss it later. - No, I beg you, Squarcio. You must tell me right now. Because it's not true that I haven't been capable. We will have another child... A boy! A boy! Rosetta! Another boy! What can you fear, with four men in the family? Listen, we could even man a trawler. There's no one who can fish like me! And my three sons on board! The finest crew in the Mediterranean. And we'll have huge gear, all new. We could even install a fridge and go far out... far out on the open seas, and reach the coast of Africa. Great things, you'll see! You'll see what I'm telling you, Rosetta. Rosetta? Squarcio... is there really no other way to get all this? Stop! Everybody, stop! Let's start here, facing west. Now then... Good luck. See you tonight! Nice boat, Squarcio! Where'd you get it? H e got it from his fairy godmother. Give it back to Santamaria! Greetings to Natale for us, Squarcio. You made it, Salvatore. Each one adapts as he can. Good luck. Speak, Salvatore. - Speech, we want a speech. - Strength and courage, Salvatore. Speeches I don't know how. We're doing this for our families, for our children you all know. Louder! Come on, Salvatore! Continue! Speak! Listen up! By uniting our nets, we could enclose 10 miles of s ea. We've got our own fridge in the village, and strong arms! Now it all depends on us. Good luck, fishermen. Let's begin! Strength to the Co-op! Long live the Co-op! An extraordinary day. Eh, sons? A great day for fishing. Yes, Papa. And the admiral knows nothing. The admiral is sleeping. Even as we are back at sea, why don't the y speak? What hav e they got against me? What are the y short of? Bore, rev up the motor a bit. Afraid of burning too much dies el oil? Tonino, on Sunday, the three of us will go fishing with nets. Happy? From now on, I'm Natale's only supplier, and Tonino is ashamed of me. I need to talk to him. I need to talk to him, immediately. Papa! Papa! Bore, take a look at Tonino! Is he alive? Bring him here. He's alive! He's alive! You're alive, alive, big boy. Alive! Try, Bore, try and help me. Tonino needs to be taken to the village. Let's try together, for mercy's sake. My legs! Again... again... don't worry. We can't make it, Squarcio. We won't be able to make it. Papa... Papa... Listen. Your brother's losing too much blood. You two'll make it. Take him to the village, Bore. Straight to the hospital. Then come back with someone. Go on, hurry! Grab him by the arms. That way you can keep his chest raised. Papa! Be strong, Bore! Be strong! Be brave, Tonino! Gently... gently, Bore... Come, Bore. Come quick. Write down what I say. It's best this way, you never know. Courage. Write! I'm not able to. Ah, Bore, you told me you'd learnt how. It doesn't matter. Then listen, and repeat it all well to Rosetta. She'll take care of everything. The boat must be given back to Santamaria because it's his. The motor, I'm leaving it to you and Tonino. And all three of you must help Diana when she marries Renato. Wait, one more thing. Salvatore, the Co-op... it'll solve everything, you know, Bore... like bombs... perhaps better. Tell Salvatore from me that the Co-op... will do good business, because within a few years no one on the islands will know how to fish better than Squarcio's sons. Don't cry, Bore... men don't cry. You'll see, I'll make it. Go now, my little one. You've never run the boat on your own... but I'm sure you'll make it. You've got to hurry... Tonino's in your hands and perhaps me too. Be strong, Papa! Strong, so I can make it in time. The air valv e, Bore! The wind's blowing, the northwesterly. Pity... It was a great day for fishing... like I used to fish! THE END
