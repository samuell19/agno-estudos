I'm pleased, Ms. Teiss. Please take space. Andreas Benz lost today the trial before the federal court. The judges upheld the verdict, that put him in a Controversial circumstantial evidence process found guilty. By a fake one Robbery murder of his aunt he got himself the multi-million dollar want to secure an inheritance. He denied this act to the end. His friends are still from convinced of his innocence. We're going to the European Court of Human Rights, because this is a scandalous miscarriage of justice! Andi is innocent. Evidence was ignored, were deliberately sloppy! You have a long time ahead of you. Are you going to wait for your fiancÃ©? Sure, but that's not necessary. Because it will come out that he is innocent. This brings up a controversial case, the judiciary and the public has been busy for a long time, a temporary end. Why are you coming to me now? I saw a man who reminds me of Andi. And was this man Herr Benz? I dont know. - OK. When will you have Mr. Benz last seen? 19 years ago, about. He broke contact of the conviction completely. At some point I gave up. What do you want to know? I want to know if he did it. Do you need something? Are you hungry? You have to go. My husband and children sleep upstairs. You don't wake up. it was good to see you Come along! No. Dear jesus, please help the monkey that he wakes up and that he will be well again and can walk again. Thank you dear Jesus. Wow, it's been a long time! Hi. - Hi. I'm sorry about the delay. Sorry, really! But good that you came. I didn't want to be on the phone... And? How are you doing? You look great. Good. Thank you. And your husband? you have two daughters Yes. Everyone is fine. They are all healthy. We are blessed. And you? How's Walti doing? Um, I'm not anymore... together with Walti. We are divorced. Oh I see. I'm sorry for that. It's better this way. Matthias and Daniel live with me. But they're always on the go. you know i'm alive with a woman. Already a few years. That's nice. You should try it too. It's because of Andi. He's free. I'm sure you heard that, but... Maybe it's a rumour. But I believe it's true. Andi died. What? I know from my ex husband and that of a colleague. Apparently Andi wanted to to an ashram in India, and had an accident on the way there. I'm sorry. You don't have to be sorry, that... that was my old life. Already crazy. 20 years in the box and then... out and... dead. Yes. He never really lived! So crazy. do you have me a cigarette No. - None? Great thank you! Ah, Miss Teiss. - Herr Hartmann. I still have visitors, but I can take time for you. We go to the presentation room. One moment please. Please come. There you go. Yes, he was on a train ride from Mumbai to Pune electrocuted. While it is common in India to ride on the train roof, but not on this route. If you don't know about it, this can quickly become life-threatening. I'm sorry. I don't know if you do all still interested Under these circumstances. You paid for it. Ms Teiss... - I'm sorry, what? Your question about guilt. Yes, but. I try to be brief. You know most of it. For us, the most obvious approach was find out whether Mr. Benz committed the crime while in custody confessed to someone. He had relatively few social contacts, but we could with 2 longtime fellow inmates and talk to a supervisor. All three could make credible, that Mr. Benz opposite them categorically denied the crime. Another exciting detail from these interviews: Mr. Benz read all your letters, and again and again. He even built in his cell a kind of little altar for you. But back to the facts. The key indicator is yes the blood on the shoe... Excuse me. Is all this too much for you? No. do you want that we continue to investigate even now, after the death of Mr. Benz? No I do not think so. Thank you. The most likely is mostly the truth. Do you want me to escort you out? - No thanks, no problem. Just go straight to the lift and then to the 0. And don't worry, the dog won't do anything. Goodbye, Ms Teiss. OK if I still go to Laura's? We still have to study for history. are you coming home for dinner You can also eat with us. No problem. Are your parents at home? - Yes. Say Meike and Paul a greeting from me. Bye. Tell your mom I'm coming next week again to the 40 plus. I tell her. shit man Put your shoes on! She wants to run away, man! Stay here! Caution! Ah! You bitch! ok - Fucking bitch! Hey! This is my mother! Hey! This is my mother! What! Fuck! Get lost, man! Go away! tighten the belt! Fasten the belt! He's sleeping. Hi? Hey! Hey! Hey!

In the storm he learns to fly. That's why the eagle mother kicks her young from the nest, so they can learn to fly. But if they don't make it she catches the boys with their wings up again. you are now in the middle of a storm, Ruth. you will be strengthened get out of the storm. But I think for now you can't do it alone Therefore... let us catch you let HIM catch you. And so he and we can help you you have to talk to us And tell us what's going on. Jesus loves you. He loves you unconditionally. Despite everything, no matter what happened. He loves you and stands with open arms. He's just waiting that you confide in him. And he can hold you.

Is it the monkey chasing you? He's still paralyzed. The treatment doesn't work. But they don't want to redeem him. Ruth I think you have to let go of the monkey. It's bad, what they did, sure. But that's none of your business. The father is surely looking at the monkey. Just do your job and nothing more. What happened to you and Naomi? Naomi. I know it's... complicated. It's a test for all of us. But maybe... Maybe we can no longer be silent. Maybe we can find a version that we can tell. you want me to lie - No. Of course not. But... Maybe we can omit a part. When I talk, I tell everything. Everything. It is good. You damn whore! OK. We talk. Andrew is back. I'm sorry. And? What? Have you met him? Yes. And? What? did you guys sleep together Hm. Yes.
