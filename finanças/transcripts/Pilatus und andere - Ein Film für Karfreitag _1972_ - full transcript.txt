In this movie, made by Andrzej Wajda and group of Polish actors in 1971 for Channel 2 television in West Germany, Jan Kreczmar played his last great role. You will hear his and other voices as they were recorded while filmmaking. Pilate and the others - based on The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov PILATE AND OTHERS I know you hold a very responsible position here. We'd like to hear your thoughts about it. What is your task? My task? First I earn trust of the others, then I become a leader and lead the group forward. We all come in at once. I slip out through the side door and the rest keeps walking. - It's not an easy task. - I'm busy all day long. Sometimes I don't even have time to smoke. I'm exhausted in the evenings. Wouldn't you say that what happens to the rest is even worse? Of course! However that's why I try to ease their suffering as much as I can. The mess and chaos make it worse. When everything goes according to the plan, it's easier for them, too. Doesn't your job make you wonder or raise doubts? Absolutely but someone has to do it and I'm the best for that job. And if you'd refused to carry out the order? Someone would simply replace me. Nothing more. - Are you sure? - Completely. My successor would be a lot worse than me, I'm sure. Would you say your job is morally correct? You can say I'm the victim of the system, in a way. But that's where I belong. I'm being appreciated here. I shouldn't let them down. So you can't see any moral dilemmas? Only a free man can be totally moral. I don't believe such a great cause could be immoral. Thank you for the interview. Your welcome. FILM BY ANDRZEJ WAJDA BASED ON MIKHAIL BULGAKOV NOVEL "THE MASTER AND MARGARITA" PILATE You're the one who was inciting to destroy the temple of Jerusalem? My good man... You're calling me a good man? You're mistaken. Everyone in Jerusalem should tell you I'm a monster and that's true. Centurion Ratslayer, come here! Call Roman Procurator "a hegemon". Don't use any other words. And stand still. Do you get it or must I hit you again? I understand, don't beat me. - Name? - Mine? I know my own! Don't pretend to be stupider than you are. Your name! Yeshua. - What do they call you? - Ha-Notsri. - Where are you from? - From town Gamala. - And your family? - I don't know. I don't remember my parents. - Where do you live? - I have no home. He's a hobo then. - Any relatives? - No, I'm all alone. - Can you read or write? - Yes! - You speak any foreign languages? - Greek. So, you intended to destroy the temple and were inciting the people? My dear... Hegemon! It was not my intention. I have never persuaded anyone to do something so pointless. But that's what it says: you were inciting to pull down the temple. That's what people said. No, hegemon. There's a man who follows me with his parchment and writes down my every word. Once I caught a glimpse of that writing and I was petrified. There was literally nothing I'd said! I asked him to give the parchment to me or to burn it. But he took it away from me and escaped. - Who are you talking about? - Matthew the Levite. He used to be a procurer. At first he was hostile and insulted me. I mean he was rude because he called me a dog. Although personally I don't consider that word to be offensive. After he'd heard me talking, he threw the money onto the road and started wandering with me. The things I hear here! A procurer who threw away his money? That's right. He said he despised his money from that time on. So, what did you tell the people in the market about the temple? That the temple of old beliefs will fall and the new temple of truth shall be built. I said that to be understood more clearly. Why should you disturb peoples' minds talking about truth, when you have no idea about it? What is true then? The truth is you've got a headache. The pain is so acute you petty-mindedly wish to be dead. You don't want to talk to me or look at me. You only long for your dog who is the only creature you're attached to. Do not worry, though. The suffering shall pass. I'd advise you to leave the palace and have a walk in the neighbourhood. Maybe in the gardens? It'll do you good. I'd gladly accompany you. I have some new thoughts, I'd like to share them with you. You should find them interesting, because you seem a wise man to me. I regret you're too closed and finally lost faith in men. You must admit one shouldn't show devotion only to a dog. Untie his hands. Tell the truth - you're a great medic! No, hegemon, I'm not. If you want it to be a secret, so be it. It has nothing to do with the case. So you maintain that you never incited people to pull down or burn, or destroy the temple in any other way? No, hegemon. I never persuaded anyone to do it. Do I seem insane to you? Oh, no, you don't seem insane. Swear to me it didn't happen. What should I swear by? By your life. It's hanging by a thread. And you think you made it hang by a thread? If so, you're mistaken. I can cut the thread. The only one who can do it is the one who hung my life. Is that so? Is that true that you entered the town by Susim Gate mounting a donkey? I hear people greeted you like you were a prophet! No, hegemon, I have no donkey. I came to Jerusalem by foot. The only person accompanying me was Matthew the Levite. No one cheered because no one here knew me. Do you happen to know people by the name of Dismas, Hestas or Bar-Rabban? I do not know those good men, hegemon. Why do you constantly talk of good men? Do you consider all people to be good? Yes. There are no bad men. That's the first time I've ever come across an opinion like that. No need to write that down. Did you read about it in one of your Greek books? I've come to that conclusion myself. - Is that what you preach? - Yes. What about centurion Ratslayer? Is he a good man, too? He is. He became cruel and callous when other good men... Good men threw themselves at him like dogs at a bear! If it hadn't been for the troop of cavalry commanded by me, you wouldn't have a chance to talk to Ratslayer now, philosopher. If I really had a chance to talk to him, I'm sure he'd change immensely. Hegemon examined the case of the vagrant philosopher, Yeshua and concluded his deeds had had nothing to do with the disorder. The philosopher was insane. That's why the Procurator can't approve the death sentence ruled by the Lesser Sandhedrin. For utopian preaching of Ha-Notsri could cause riots, the procurator orders to remove Yeshua from Jerusalem and to imprison him in Caesarea Stratonova on the Mediterranean. That's where Procurator's own residence is. - Would that be all? - No. What else? Ha-Notsri... Have you ever said anything about our great Caesar? Answer me. Did you or did you not? It's nice and easy to tell the truth. Speak up then. But weigh every word, if you don't want to die a painful death. Have you met one Judas from the town of Karioth? What did you say to him about Caesar? Two days ago... Just before dusk... I met a young man who called himself Judas from Karioth. He invited me to dine with him. - Is he a good man, too? - He is! And eager to learn. He asked me to share my thoughts with him. - And he lit the candles. - Yes... He did light the candles. He asked me to explain my views on the authority. He was very interested in them. Well? What did you say to him? That all power is a violence against people. The time will come when there'll be no rule by Caesar nor any other. Men shall be in the kingdom of truth and justice. What happened next? Some strange men came in. Tied me up and took me to prison. There never has been and there's never going to be a better ruler than great and generous Caesar Tiberius! You're not the one to judge, you mad criminal! Take the guards out of the balcony. I want to stay alone with the suspect. It's a matter of national importance. It seems my conversation with the man from Karioth has led to misfortune. I've got a premonition something bad is going to happen to him. I feel sorry for him. I think there's someone you should pity more than him. So, the Ratslayer and the men who beat you for your preaching, as well as the robbers Dismas and Hestas, even that dirty traitor Judas - these are all good men? Yes. And there'll be the kingdom of truth. There'll be, hegemon. It never will! You scoundrel! You felon! It'd have been better, if you had your throat cut before you'd met Judas. Perhaps you could let me go? They want to kill me. I do not share your beliefs! And remember! If you say even a word about it to anyone, beware! I repeat - beware! - Hegemon, I... - Silence! Here! I confirm the sentence on accused Ha-Notsri pronounced by the Lesser Sanhedrin! Take the convict to the commanding officer of secret service. I examined the case of Yeshua Ha-Notsri. I approved the death penalty. Therefore I convicted three felons: Dismas, Hestas and Bar-Rabban. And that Yeshua Ha-Notsri. Bar-Rabban and Ha-Notsri were arrested by local authorities and sentenced by Sanhedrin. The great feast of Pesach is at hand and I wish to know, which one of them would you like to give back his freedom to? Bar-Rabban or Ha-Notsri? Sanhedrin requests to free Bar-Rabban. I must admit your answer is astonishing to me. Bar-Rabban is much more dangerous than Ha-Notsri. Sanhedrin examined the case very carefully. I repeat - our intention is to free Bar-Rabban. Despite my intervention?! I represent Roman authority! High Priest, say it for the third time. And for the third time I say that we shall release Bar-Rabban. Very well then. So be it. I can't catch a breath... I'm suffocating. It is stifling today. I'm sure there's a storm coming. The month of Nisan has been terrible this year! No... That's not the reason I'm out of breath. The world's become too small for us both, Caiaphas. Beware, High Priest! What is it I hear? You threaten me although you approved the sentence yourself? Can this be so? We're used to Procurator who weighs his words before saying anything. Are we not being overheard, hegemon? What do you suggest, High Priest? Who would overhear us here? I know what I'm saying and where I'm saying it! I'm not a child, Caiaphas. Not even a mouse would sneak in here! Not even... How do you call him? The one from town of Karioth. Do you know him? You must know then that henceforth you won't find peace! Neither you nor your people! I, Pontius Pilate, knight of the Golden Lance, tell you so! The Jewish people knows that you hate it with a terrible hatred. But God shall protect us! We'll be heard by mighty Caesar! He shall protect us from the oppressor, Pilate! Too many times have you complained of me to Caesar! Now my time has come! You'll feel sorry you've sentenced to death the philosopher who's announced peace! Peace? It was not peace that was brought by that rebel to Jerusalem. And you certainly know it! Do you even believe your own words, Procurator? No, you don't. You wanted him out so that he would incite people. Ridicule our religion and bring my people to Roman swords. Can you hear, Pilate? Listen to this, Procurator! It's almost noon, our conversation is taking too long. They're waiting for us. In the name of imperial Caesar! Four criminals have been captured in Jerusalem. For murder, incitement to rebellion... Acting against law and religion... They've been condemned to shameful form of death - crucifixion. The execution shall be carried out shortly on Mount Golgotha. The names of the felons: Dismas, Hestas, Bar-Rabban and Ha-Notsri. However only three of them are going to be executed. The name of the one who's going to be released just before you is... Bar-Rabban! MATTHEW Yeshua, I've saved you! I'm leaving with you! It's me, Matthew. Your faithful confessor... And the only follower. Yeshua! When you're being beaten, turn the other cheek! It's Matthew... Fool! Idiot! A miracle... My God... Send a miracle. I do believe. Send him death, immediately... Please, God... I beg of you! I'm a believer, can you hear me?! Give Yeshua death! I'll write that down... I, Matthew the Levite... Have been sitting here for two hours but death's not come yet. God, why did you turn aside from him? Send him death! I curse you, God! You must be deaf! If you were not, you'd have sent him death instantly! I'm disappointed in you! But there are other religions, different Gods! They wouldn't let a man who's never hurt anyone to die like this! They would send him death! I was mistaken! You're the god of evil! Your ears can hear nothing but pleads of the priests! I curse you, god of evil! You're a patron of criminals, protector of son-of-the... Another hour passed. And death has not come yet... A miracle! Send a miracle, my God! Forgive me! Forgive me! Make one more miracle, do not feel offended by me! Make a thunderbolt strike him! JUDASZ You declared them dead yourself? The Procurator may be sure of that. Tell me, were they given a drink before they died? Yes, but... He didn't want to drink it. Who do you mean? Excuse me, Procurator. Didn't I mention his name? - Ha-Notsri. - What a mad man! To die of sunstroke! Why refuse what the Iaw provides for? How did he refuse? He said thank you. And blamed no one for taking his life. Who did he mean? He didn't say, hegemon. Nothing more... Nothing more. For the time being... We can't find any of his followers. However we can't be sure there are none. Therefore, to avoid surprises, do remove all 3 corpses as quickly and quietly as you can. Bury them so that nothing more is ever heard of them. I take it as an order. For the matter is complicated and very important, do allow me to proceed. No! I'd like you to take a seat again. Two more things. First... Your admirable diligence in carrying out your task as chief of the secret service to the Procurator makes me want to mention it in a report to Rome. I should gladly do that. I'm happy to serve you, hegemon. And I'm happy to hear that. Now the second matter. What's his name? Judas of Karioth. They say he was given money for making the madman feel welcomed. He's going to be paid. A lot? No one can tell, hegemon. - Even you? - Even me. Unfortunately. I do know that he will be paid this evening. He has been summoned to Caiaphas' palace. One old greedy man from Karioth. He is old, isn't he? Procurator is never mistaken. Yet, he is mistaken now. The man from Karioth is young. What else? Is he a fanatic? No, Procurator. Anything else? He's very handsome. Apart from that! Any weaknesses? It's impossible to know everything about each citizen of such a big city. Oh, Arthanius... Do not underestimate yourself. There is a weakness. He craves money. And what does he do? Obtains money. Right... The thing is... I was informed he was going to be stabbed tonight. You've been too favourable, Procurator. I do not deserve commendation in Rome. I have no such information. But you do deserve! However I know that man will be slaughtered tonight. I dare to ask, who was the informer. Forgive me, but I can't reveal it. The information is casual, uncertain and unclear. My obligation is to try to foresee everything. My duty as a Procurator. The report I received today said they were going to kill that man tonight. And the money he'd received for betraying Yeshua would be returned to High Priest with a note saying: "I give back your accursed money!". Just think about it! Will High Priest be glad to receive such a gift on Pesach night? Glad? I presume it'll cause a scandal. I think so, too. That's why I want you to take care of it. Do everything you can to save Judas from Karioth. I take it as hegemon's order. I should put your mind at ease, though. The plan is difficult to carry out. They'd have to find the man, stab him to death... Find out how much he got... And finally find a way to return the money to Caiaphas. All that should happen in one night. Tonight? Nevertheless he will be murdered tonight. That's my premonition. And it never fails me. So be it. He's going to be slaughtered. Yes! The only hope is your efficiency. Vale, Procurator! Call Shorty. Hello? I must see you. Wait for me at the door. I'll be right there. Alright... I'm here, boss. These are the things. Take this. - Change your clothes. - That should be amusing! Niza! Where are you going? We were supposed to meet. I wanted to see you, you said you'd be home all day. I've changed my mind. - Let's go to the palm house. - Agreed. No one should see us together. Wait a few minutes, after I come in. I'll see you in a big room. How much did you get? Talk, if you want to save your life. How much did you get? Forgive me, philosopher. From now on, we'll always be together. You'll be wherever I go. When they'll remember me, they'll remember you. Cowardice is one of the most terrible blames of a man. I can't agree with you, philosopher. It's the most terrible! And yet you were no coward when furious people wanted to kill the Ratslayer. Forgive me, philosopher. Would you, in your wisdom, expect the Procurator to defend a man who offended Caesar and abandon his career? Yes... He will abandon. I should face charges, Procurator. You were right. I couldn't save Judas of Karioth from being murdered. He's been stabbed to death, just as you predicted. I deserve to be court-martialled and dismissed. The murderers left it in High Priest's house. This blood belongs to Judas. I wonder how much there is... 30 tetradrachms. Not much. - Where's the deceased? - I do not know. We're going to start looking for him in the morning. Are you sure he's dead? I've worked in Judea for 15 years! I do not need to see a body to know that a man was killed. Judas from Karioth was stabbed to death a few hours ago. I'm sorry, Arthanius. I've not been sleeping too well recently. I keep dreaming of a moonbeam. That's even funny... Imagine me walking on that beam... They threw it over the walls of Caiaphas' palace. - With a note? - Yes. Exactly as you predicted, Procurator: "I give back your accursed money!". What are you doing, Arthanius?! You're breaking temple seals! It has to be that way, hegemon. I can imagine what was happening at Caiaphas'! There was a huge stir! They invited me right away. When I asked about the money, they said they had not pay. Did they? If they say so... The more difficult it will be to find the murderers. That's right, Procurator. I wish I could've seen them killing him. It was done very skilfully. Take a closer look at this pouch. Judas' blood must've been gushing! I've seen many dead man in my life, Procurator. We might be sure he will not rise again? Only when the trumpet of messiah calls for him. No sooner. That's clear then. Let's talk about the burial. The felons had been already buried, Procurator. Arthanius, it would be a crime to court-martial you! You deserve the highest praise. How was it managed? When my secret service squad reached the hill after dark, there was one body missing. I could've foreseen that. Let it not bother you. It was soon found by a man... - Matthew the Levite. - Yes, that was his name. He didn't want to leave the body. - Has he been arrested? - No, Procurator. - Did they drive him out? - No. I let him stay and take part in the burial. Perhaps I've made a mistake? Oh, no! You have not. I feel anxious - I'm dealing with a man who never makes mistakes. I mean you. I should've seen that Matthew. He's here, Procurator. Thank you very much, Arthanius, for everything that you've done. Please, take this as a token. It's a great honour to me, Procurator. Reward the squad that carried out the burial and reprimand the men who failed to protect Judas. Now I'd like to talk to Matthew. Vale, Procurator. What's the matter with you? - What's wrong? - Nothing. - I'm tired. - Take a seat. Why didn't you sit in the chair? I'm dirty. I summoned you to show me the knife. The soldiers took it away from me, when they brought me here. Tell them to give it back to me, hegemon. I must return it to the owner, I've stolen it! What for? To cut the ropes. Where did you get that knife? Baker's shop, on the left. Don't worry about the knife. We'll give it back to the shop. Now show me the paper where you wrote Yeshua's words. You want it for yourself! I didn't say "give". I said "show". "There's no death..." "Yesterday we ate sweet bread..." "We'll see pure river of the water of life..." "Mankind shall look at the sun through transparent crystal..." There. I see you're a man who loves books. You shouldn't be walking the streets in wretched clothes, having no home. I've got a large library at Caesarea. You'd take care of my papyruses. No... I don't want to. I don't want to because you'll be afraid of me. It won't be easy for you to look me in the face, after having killed him! Be quiet! Take the money. You consider yourself to be Yeshua's disciple? Then I've got to say you didn't understand a word of his preaching. If you had, you'd have accepted my gift. Remember what he said before he died. He blamed no one. You're cruel, he wasn't. Where will you go? You should know, hegemon... There's a man in Jerusalem who I'm going to kill. You should know there will be more bloodshed. I already know that. Your words do not surprise me. The man you're planning to kill is me. I know it's impossible. I'm not stupid - I don't count on it. But I'll slit Judas' throat. Even if it takes the rest of my life. You won't be able to do that. Don't worry about it. He was murdered tonight. Who did it? You must not be jealous. He had other believers except you. Who did it? I did. Not in terms of deeds, but it was my decision. Will you take something from me now? Order them to give me a clean piece of parchment.
