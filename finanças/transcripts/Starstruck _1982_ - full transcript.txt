Oh, Agnes. It's Angus, face ache. JACKIE: They're not looking at you. It's me. I've got that certain kind of animal presence. I'm scared. I wonder if I'll get discovered at the Lizard Lounge tonight. God, knowing my luck I might crack it, and then some nuclear holocaust will come along and ruin my career. Or worst still, your hairdo. Half of me week's wages. I wouldn't be so scared if I had my own band. A band? Whoa, how's legs that. She'd be good for a shag. As if you'd know how. I want a band. I want amplifiers. I want, I want, I want. Life's just a matter of what you want. Start at wanting a Volkswagen, and you'll end up with a Volkswagen. I don't want a Volkswagen. If you start at wanting a Jag, you'll end up with a Jag.

Piss off! [ Indistinct chatter ] You get to school. With a bag on my head? I'd rather die. Besides, you know I hate group activity. NANA: I don't care. You're going just as soon as you look normal. And when'll that be? You're not telling me everything you know, are you? Auntie Pearl, I left and got the last bus home. I don't know anything more. As God's me judge. So how did you escape? Why get involved? 90% of the time it's just rip off agents and take away grease burgers, and all the fights. I bet you just hate to get back to fitting and turning and vegetating. Think of that next time you play guitar, huh? Playing isn't everything. Let's just talk about... Sex? Okay. My cousin, Angus, he's reading this book, Sex Psychology, and he reckons guitars are like phallic symbols, and guitarists masturbate for a living. So God knows why you need me. What are you two, Siamese twins? Siamese cousins, actually. You see, his parents... Yeah? So, where are they? Well, his dad went fruit-picking, and his mom went to Jesus. The last I heard, she was nerve nuts in Brisbane, no, Perth. Born-again virgin. Speaking of which, I better go. You sure it's early? Positive. You big fat fibber! [ Kissing ] Ah, hey. Hey! [ Horn blowing ] [ Moped engine rumbling ] That must be the 9:55. See... Godzilla broke down. You must be good and tired. No, just tired. See, we were at this club, and Angus talked them into letting me sing, so I just sang. Just sang, yeah. You've always enjoyed singing yourself, Nana. I enjoy a good sing song now and then, but I've never used my voice to attract men. ANGUS: Now, Nana, if what I am reading here is right, you've got a good dead-set case of penis envy. I don't know where he gets these ideas from. ANGUS: You wouldn't have to be Freud to work that one out. It's all them books, Nana. Makes the brains too big for their head. Oh. God Almighty.

What with, hot air? ANGUS: Star quality, Auntie Pearl. Star quality. Mm. MAN: Hey, set one up, will you, love? These two have themselves on. And what will that be? Star quality? It's that... Little something extra. Yeah? Well, so is bullshit, and you're both full of it. MAN: Pipeless dreamers, eh, love? Oh, well. Wish you'd be as serious about the serious things of life.

Yeah, I pretended I was mom, and they said you were mad, so I agreed. Then I said we'd be keeping you away all week at the psychiatrist. Gee, thanks. -NANA: You sure you can manage? -PEARL: Of course. -NANA: You look after yourself. -PEARL: I'll do that. NANA: Quick, quick, come and say good-bye to your mother. Oh, love.

Yeah, they go right up to her bum, but they're not on the menu. Well, I better have a chop, then. [ Indistinct chatter ] NANA: This is about who, the constitution? Here. I'm on me lunch hour. Honest.

Well, you can't bring it back, you already bit it. Oh, thanks, love. MAN: We could all starve to death by the time you all get the bread buttered. How about some service? How about taking your times? Our problem is we're obscure. We're even more obscure than her. You know what that is? Angus, I've been meaning to tell you, that's a girl. No, no, dummy, it's publicity. So, bad boys get publicity. -So what? -Here, you get back to school. [ Phone ringing ] WOMAN: Terry Lambert's Office. ANGUS: Could I speak with Terry? WOMAN: Not in, I'm afraid. When will he be there? Might I ask what you're after? ANGUS: It's about this singer. A great singer, but she's in a hurry. I might have to take her elsewhere. WOMAN: Good luck, then. [ Phone disconnects ] [ Phone ringing ] MAN: Seven National News Room. I've got a story for you. MAN: Yeah, what type of story? It's one of those stories you use to distract people from the real news. MAN: Look, is this some kind of juvenile prank? I have to ask, how old are you? Pffft! MAN: Yes, but, madam, these people are on every second corner, you know? ANGUS: Not like this one. She's marvelous at balancing. She can balance on anything. MAN: Yes, well, look, I'm afraid it doesn't sound like our type of thing. Man, have you ever seen anyone balancing in the nude? MAN: Naked? Where, in the city? Yes, virtually. She just wears a few little strings. MAN: Yeah, okay. Just let me get a pen. Now, where does this happen and at what time? -Circular Quay. -MAN: Yup. -Thursdays. -MAN: Right. [ Whistling ] Sh-sh-sh.

I'm afraid he's in conference. NANA: Sod, wagging school again. ANGUS: But it's his mother. I'm all alone with a burglar loose in the house.

She's a winner, she's a star. You'll land us in the law court. You've gone too far this time. ANGUS: I've got further to go yet. Obscene phone calls. [ Phone hangs up ] Angus, you're a maniac. You can't be serious. You are serious. Well, forget it. Absolutely not. N-O. Know what happens if you don't take a risk? Nothing. Less than nothing. I will not do it, okay? [ Balls clacking ] ANGUS: How do you feel? Sweaty and dizzy with all these silver spots swimming in front of my eyes. Angus, how did you talk me into this? Because you wanted me to talk you into it. God, you get away with murder. Huh, what about all the junk you've conned me into? Like the blue hair, and what about the time you claimed you'd learned witchcraft? JACKIE: That was years ago. ANGUS: Hey, up here! And you put a hex on me, so you said, and made me eat crushed worms and dog shit to cast away the evil spell. It was only liverwurst. [ Explosion ] [ Indistinct chatter ] Hold this, will you, mate? [ Indistinct chatter ] JACKIE: Angus, is anyone taking any notice of this? ANGUS: I reckon they soon will.

[ Indistinct chatter ] MAN: You want to be a professional aerialist? I want to be a singer. Then, why the tight rope? JACKIE: Ask him, he thought of it. Look, this is agony. I can't hold on much longer. MAN: Is she going to drop? Well, not until I finish this interview, I'm not. When you decided to pull this stunt, did you realize how much trouble you'd cause? JACKIE: I'm just trying to spark things up a bit. I'm emotional. I sing because I'm emotional. Perhaps you could trace all this back to a very unhappy childhood. MAN: Hang on, dear, hang on. Look, I've done me dash, Angus. I want you down there when I splatter. And when they scrape me up, just remember, it was all your fault! ALL: Jump, jump, jump! Is that Terry Lambert?

She is currently being held by Phillips Street Police. And Sydney's weather... MAN: What you doing? MAN: Not unless it's all of us. MAN: Okay, okay. I just want to see her. [ Balls clacking ] Do you like The Beatles? They broke up when he was two. Righty-o, Cinderella. Prince Charming's here to bail you out. It's probably Hazza. TERRY: Excuse me, I'm waiting for a singer and a manager. That's, um, we... This toddler's the phone clone? -I'm 14. -He's short for his age. I'm not, I just look short when I wear blue. Do you realize you've misused the police force, the fire brigade, and the rescue squad? But did we make the papers? TERRY: How do you think I found you? More to the point, why did you make me find you? Because we're your number one fans in the entire world. We owed it to you, so you could find out about Jackie to be on your Opera House show. [ Indistinct chatter ] -WOMAN: Terry, autograph? -TERRY: Debbie? WOMAN: Yeah, Debbie. [ Camera shutters ] Right. Well, I will do a story on you in my pop column. I guess we're a hot item, huh? Humble, Angus, humble. A Cadillac. Wow! Your coach. Da-dum! [ Laughing ] Shit, a car with a TV set. Angus, I think all your lies are starting to come true.

Perhaps, it's just a need to get all the love than an audience can give. In fact, you could probably trace it back -to a very unhappy childhood. -Little cow. MAN: We arrived here, and she was dangling... We always gave her more toys than anyone. MAN: Event to take place here, and it appears to be happening above us in the street where a lady is naked waist up and doing a tightrope walk across the street. MAN: Well, she's exposed, isn't she? That female's exposing herself. That is disgusting. MAN: Apart from her humorous attire, the fact remained that the display was full of potential danger. It wasn't long before she'd attracted more than just spectators. [ Sirens blaring ] [ Indistinct chatter ] [ Screaming ] MAN: That's disgusting. She's an outrage. Shut up, you!
