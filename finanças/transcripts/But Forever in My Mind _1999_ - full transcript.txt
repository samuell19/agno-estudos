BUT FOREVER IN MY MIND Rome University last night... as the police broke down the gates... that the students had blocked... The cabinet's decision on law and order: Illegal carriers of weapons face immediate trial... subversive meeting places to be shut down... ... lifeless, hidden from view... by a makeshift shroud. A fifth man died soon after, in hospital. Aldo Moro was taken by a Red Brigade commando. The Soviet Union has, moreover... built up a huge nuclear arsenal. In Greenham Common, in Berkshire... the cruise missiles have arrived. Every day, part of the Berlin Wall comes down... but the People's Police demolish... the final, symbolic piece. Repression in China: Over 1,000 arrests. Rebels and rioters... are identified in foreign news programs. Over 150 universities are now occupied by students all over Italy. If Italians think that the financing of political parties... which many know nothing about... although most people know very well... has done a lot of harm to the country... Ulivo coalition: 157 seats... Polo: 116, Lega: 27... Progressisti, the reformists... At this point, it seems... rather clear... that Ulivo has won the elections. - Yes? - You coming down? What will I think of me at 16 when I'm 45, my dad's age? And what is there after death? I feel like I'll never die. To me, love is all-important. More than the fear of falling in love, of dying... than being standardised or setting the world to rights. And it's not easy to right. OK, ready. 15,000 Liras? Must be good stuff. - It's Afghan. Know what that means? - What? A little is enough, so pass the paper. - Can you roll it? - I practise with Dad's tobacco. - Silvio! - Shit. Act natural. - Silvio! - Coming. - Hello. - Hi, Ponzi. I'll take Chiara, get Mom, and come back. - OK. - Not working? - It's Saturday. - We had a deal. I've no homework. - They're occupying school. - This year, too? Keep out of it. It's not definite. Good, you know what I think. You'll go to another school. Let's go, Chiara. 'Bye. I'd rather die than change schools! We'll talk about it tonight! Have they gone? To find a girl, we should hang around the bookstores. A bit of an intellectual... What will you say to her? - We'll have to read more. - We never read a thing. I read Arturo's Island. You've been saying that for two years. What will your first time be like? Very dirty. - How long? - Five minutes, minimum. If it takes you less you're a kid. She'll pick a more experienced guy. If we carry on like this, we'll be adults before we do it. Martino has a three-month lead. He was lucky enough to meet Valentina, who'd do it. If you find one who's a proud virgin, forget it! If she's crazy about you, you've got more of a chance. If she's already done it, that's cool. Piece of cake! You do it at once. The minute there's nobody home. - It's me. Hi, Lollo. - Hi, Silvio. Any ideas for tonight? - No... - Put him through. - How about the setup? - The setup? We'll dress preppy. You promised me my money today. If you come to the setup. Last Saturday, Rastoni scored. Rastoni, at the setup? I got witnesses! See you there in 30 minutes? See you there. I don't believe it. Rastoni scored? There are witnesses! Got any skintight bell-bottoms? I've got tight jeans from last year. If they're not bell-bottoms forget it. - Got any? - I hate 'em. Same here. - You know, we have to stand out. - From? The preppies. They'll see we've got personality. What? - We'll go as we are. - Are you crazy? THE CLOTHING ISSUE In Rome there are fascists, alternatives... B-Boys, and preppies from the smart quarter, Parioli. - And kids like my sister... - The straights. My brother calls alternatives "crusties." A bit like us. Kinda scruffy. Torn trousers, baggy pullovers. Nothing sophisticated. The preppies dress sophisticated. The fascists don't change. Shaved heads, boots... and bomber jackets with an Italian crest. The B-Boys spend their days skating. They wear very baggy clothes... listen to hip-hop in gangs... and tag the walls. - There are the punks, too. - Down with rules! Those who accept all the rules are the preppies. They're generally right-wing, but they aren't into politics. They all dress smart. What counts is the brand: You must wear the right one. We don't belong here. - About time! - We had nothing to wear. Where's that from? It looks preppy. - I bought it. - Fuck! - Got my money? - Come on. I need it now! 10,000 Liras is nothing now. - Stingy bastard! - Same to you! - Come on! - Asshole! No one will steal that heap. I know we're gonna score. Sure to. What are you thinking? We'll be OK once we're in. Sure. - Not you. - We're with him. - Why? - Your clothes are wrong. We're dressed alternative, but we're really preppies. Let the others through. - Can't we come in? - Thanks a lot! Come on, let's go. That club sucks. It's full of daddy's boys. If you think about it, we're daddy's boys, too. Why do you say that? We're never short of anything. But we're different from the preppies. We go to a state school. If we lived in Parioli, we'd be preppies, too. And if we'd been born in the suburbs... we'd be different. We'd be different. Come on, hurry up. We formed a committee to decide to occupy the school. We'll talk about privatisation and standardisation. - OK. - I'm counting on you. Against the privatisation of school... the anachronism of the school system... and those teachers who format our minds... I say, we occupy the school! There's Arianna Calzabini. - Where? - Near the board. She's crazy about Leon. My brother told me how to become a leader. Meaning what? Gramsci, Fidel, Che Guevara. All have one thing in common: They had something new to say. If you do the same, others will think you have personality. That's how you become a leader. The hard part's finding something new to say. - That's the hard part. - Try! Invent something. If it works, I'll support you. They make us respect their rules as if they were dogma. We must say no to all that! Excuse me, I want to say something. Let's not copy the ideas of May '68. We have to find our own identity. We've occupied the school three times. This year we're going further! Yeah, OK, but there's only a few of us versus 400 kids. It's undemocratic. I agree with him. The others don't give a damn. When it's time to decide, they'll follow us. If you're pro-government, stay with them. Down with Social Democrats! What will we do with our lives? I want to be an airline pilot. Too complicated... But if I do, it'll be wild... discovering new places all the time. It must be so cool. My dad can get me a job at the Vatican. How sad! But he only works mornings, then he chills at home. But you have to aim a bit higher in life. - Yeah? - Sure. The Vatican isn't a goal... it's a last resort. It's better than living in fear of being fired. True. My mom says not to grow up fast; these are the golden years. Your mom knows shit. - You're telling me. - Yes? It's Silvio and Ponzi. Because of the lights of the city, you can't see the stars. Were you with Valentina today? - Did you go all the way? - Sure. Your mom wasn't home today? She comes home at 5:30. We had 50 minutes. - What did you do? - I savoured every minute. First we stroked, naked. - Like me and Techno Girl! - Don't interrupt. Did you touch her down below? - First, up top. - Sure. - Gotta get 'em going. - Sure. Whadya mean, "Sure"? You've never touched a girl. Nor you. Don't interrupt. Then what? When she's ready, she won't stop your hand as you move down. When did you do it? How many minutes? About 10. You don't think about that when you're doing it. Sure. How long have you been together? Almost five months. Is it going well? - He's so jealous. - He's a pain. - Is that why you're here now? - Right. - And the sex? - Situation: Stationary. - 'Cause it's the first time. - He can't keep at it. Eleven seconds, on average. I counted! I don't know if I'll last that long. - It's a matter of concentration. - Meaning? Think of something else. Like what? - Your mom, grandma... - Gross! Otherwise, you come right away... and that's that! My sister didn't enjoy it with her first guy for a year. But with the next guy, it was heaven. You see! You have to find a real guy. - Right. - You gotta communicate... using feelings. Meaning? You have to feel that he's the right guy. Kind, gentle, caring... What else? He has to be good at it! If at 18 I haven't done it, I'm gonna see a whore. She doesn't care how long you last. I think that's so sad. - And it's risky, too. - You should wait. Some day the right moment will come. Girls who've done it once can't stop. There has to be a reason. What are you thinking about? As we talk under stars we can't see... guys who have girls are with them right now. I have a girl. - You're lucky. - Don't ditch her. It's tough when you don't have one. I want one who loves me. Me, too. - Who is it? - Ponzi. Is Silvio out? No, wait. - Is that Ponzi? - Yes. If he says they're occupying the school, you stay here. Ponzi. The principal threw us out. We're occupying! OK, I'm coming. - Well? - Well, I didn't ask. Slaves! You're slaves! - Hey, guys! - You OK? - Hi, Silvio. - They won't let us in! Shitty principal! Leon wants to go the back way. - Let's go! - This is our revolution! Let's go open the doors! Let's go through the balconies. This way! We're occupying! This way. It's great! Don't let them in! Stop! You, go back to class. You, go back to class! You, go back to class! All of you! - You can't come in! - Chill, Artemio! Goddamn kids! You're working class. You should be with us. You're not working class! The workers have no nation! - Where's Martino? - His mom said no. So? My dad did, too! C'mon, get up! Filippo, what's this about? It's against privatisation and standardisation. Sure! - Keep together! - Open up! Who let you in? Get out, or I'll call the police! We want space, they send the police! That's no democracy for the human race! What are you saying? We wanna fight the system! - The privatisation of people! - The standardisation of school! The authoritarian system you represent. What are you on about? Get down! This society needs changing, and we'll change it! If nothing changes, we'll make things change! From now on, school belongs to the students. It's ours! What can you see? We need you, too. Come on! School's occupied! Open the window! Open up! My stuff's here. I'm going nowhere! They wanna make puppets out of us! Bonardi, sit down. Bonardi, stand up. She can't order you around. We won't be tomorrow's bosses! 10, 100, 1000 occupations! This way! Let's go up there. No one in here! What's in there? Let's go in. - I'll break it down. - You will? - Break it down! - I'll break it down! - You sure broke it down. - Wow, crazy... Geez, the archives! Class 2B, '66-'67. They didn't know then they'd be part of May '68. Ascari, Alibrandi, Arcopinto, Buratti, Bandiera... What's the matter? - Can I tell you something? - What? When Martino declared his love, I felt so bad. So I heard. You didn't show you liked me. It wasn't easy. You're a year older than me. Did Martino say we don't get on now? - You don't? - Doesn't he talk about us? - Sure. - What's he say? He never said you don't get on. On the contrary. Things aren't good between us. Not good at all. - What else does he say? - I don't know. Well, actually, he says, when you make love... When we make love? He gives details... - I don't believe it! - He goes on about it. - You're kidding? - No. - Bastard! - I agree. I can't believe it. It's not right, you going out with him. Not right at all. No, please. I'm all mixed up. So am I. Martino's my friend, too. - Martino's a scumbag. - Stop it. I can't. The meeting's about to start. Coming? Let's go. - Don't tell anyone. - 'Course not. It's a secret. - Valentina! - Later. We'll split into groups: We'll have stewards... a community chest, guards on duty... and one or two meetings a day. We can make suggestions and comment on ideas... but all decisions must be approved by the meeting. - Where were you? - You won't believe me. - Martino is history. - Why? He told everyone about us. I hate the bastard! - You're right. - 'Course. Tonight I'll go with another guy, like Giulia's sister did. - God, if Martino finds out... - I know. One thing. They don't get on... you've got an excuse. She says they don't get on. You tried your luck. Bullshit. So, keep quiet till she dumps him. - Tell no one. - Sure! - Swear. - What do you take me for? What about Martino? You liked Valentina. It didn't stop you. - True. - He was an asshole. Silvio, sleeping here tonight? Tonight? I don't know. Why? We're getting our sleeping bags. You go, too. Yeah, I'll go. - Later! - Bye, Silvio. Bye, Marta. Marta spoke to me! That means Valentina mentioned you. - Know what? - What? - Tonight you'll lose your cherry. - You think? Forward, comrades! To victory! Forever! I need my sleeping bag before my dad comes home. Once I'm out, I'm OK. If I sleep here, Mom will kill me. You have no reason to stay. I do. See ya... kiddo. Ponzi, buddy. They're showing a film in there. - Know what happened to Silvio? - What? I promised not to tell. - What's it about? - Sex. - Who with? - Valentina. - She cheated on Martino! - Don't tell. Who with? Silvio? - Says who? - I guessed. - Good! I didn't tell you. - Where did it happen? In the archives. But not a word. 'Course not! - Listen to this. - What? Remember Valentina? - No. - I told you already. The babe who went out with Martino. Remember? - No, what about her? - We kissed this morning. - You and Martino? - Valentina. You did well. And she let you? - I'm not sure I did the right thing. - Why? She's still with Martino. - Since when? - Five months. - You screwed up. - I knew it. Why? When you hit on a friend's girl, things can happen. - She dumps you. - Nope. - Or she likes you. - Yup. - If not, you screwed up. - Uh-huh. If she dumps you, you've a 90% chance she'll tell her guy you hit on her. And then you really look a jerk. You get a pizza in the face and lose a pal. But if she likes me? You've a 90% chance she'll think she screwed up. So she'll change her mind and dump you. She won't tell your pal... but you'll feel bad when you see them. And if you see him, he'll be friendly... and ask why you don't talk to him anymore. Get it? You lost me. Anyway, that's the theory. And in practise? - I'm half in love. - There you go. When will you see her? I just came to get my sleeping bag. - Why? - For school. We're against privatisation and standardisation. Dad won't let you. Too bad. I have to. Yeah. Take it or lose it. I'm just yakking. It's just theory. In practise, I'm a loser. Or I'd get on better with Maddalena. - You don't get on, either? - She says the spark's gone. - Why? - I don't know. She sees me as a brother. What's that mean? That you're in shit. Deep shit. - Think she's seeing another guy? - I don't know. No one knows, that's just it. She's coming 'round to talk. What about? - Is it good? - Lots of fighting. - You'll never guess... - What? - Silvio did it with Valentina. - Says who? - Silvio told Ponzi. - I can't believe it. If we're Martino's friends, we must do something. - We're Silvio's friends, too. - Since when? - Last year. - And Martino? - Since junior high. - Exactly. Lollo... Something's happened. Come with us. - You sure they did it? - Are we sure? Valentina loves it, so it's probable. Probable. Let's be vague with Martino. - It's Lollo. - How's things there? - There's a delicate problem. - Very delicate! Ready? Sit down. I am. Go on. Silvio had a thing with Valentina. What "thing"? - A big thing. - Who told you? Silvio's telling everyone. I'll kill him! And Valentina? Valentina? We didn't ask. Don't! Ask her friends and let me know! If it's true, I'll kill 'em both! Hello? He hung up. - How did he take it? - If true, there'll be a massacre! Hi, Dad. I enquired about enrolling you at San Michele. We can discuss it tonight with Mom. No way am I going to San Michele! You must study to make something of your life. What's the sleeping bag for? Martino, you're going nowhere! If anything happens... it'll be your fault for not letting me out! - If you go, don't come back! - I won't! - Why ask her friends, not her? - To avoid trouble. - They tell each other everything. - So? So, Valentina's friends must already know. If we see they're embarrassed... Silvio was bullshitting, and it'll calm down. If they try to cover her, it means it's true. And there'll be a tragedy. - A real one. - A biggie. Well, Martino's smart. - How'll we ask them? - I'll do it. Hi, Claudia. Heard about Silvio and Valentina? - Heard what? - Their heavy petting in the archives. - Where? - In the archives. - Silvio told us. - Silvio did? We all know. Didn't Valentina say? - Say what? - You trying to cover for her? Are you crazy? She's mad at us now. - She didn't know. - No, I guess not. - We look like a bunch of jerks. - I guess so. - Know what I think? - What? - Silvio made it up. - 'Course he did. Everything's under control. I'll kill him. It's just tonight. Everyone will be there. You two once did the same thing. We were against Vietnam, the bourgeoisie: Real problems. We're fighting real things, too. We're against privatisation and standardisation. - What are you on about? - It's a matter of life and death. - Concentrate on your studies. - If you stop me, I'll run away. - Run away, then. - That's what I'm doing. You've never bothered to understand me! He's crazy... - Come back now! - No! - You're ridiculous! - No! You are! You spoiled him; it's your own fault. So it's our fault now! Where did we go wrong? You had the same education. No, we didn't! I had to wait till I was 15 to stay out till midnight. Silvio could at 14. Alberto, too. - You do things Silvio can't. - Such as? Weekends with the Boy Scouts. Catholic school and Scouts! You bet, we had the same education! - Got a minute? - What's up? - Is it true? - What? What, Claudia? What is it? - What Silvio's saying. - What's he saying? That you necked in the archives. We hardly kissed. Who did he fucking tell, anyway? Stupid bitch. Fuck you! Claudia, wait! It's not my fault. He did it all. I didn't know you still liked him. I don't give a shit. Nor do I! Stupid idiot. - Hey! - What's up? - Hello. - It's Gustavo. Is Martino there? No, he ran away to school. Where are you? - At school, too. - Don't your parents mind? I gotta go. If you see Martino, tell him I'm angry. Send him home at once! Is that clear? Repeat it! Someone's calling me. Good-bye. - Pain in the ass! - So? It's under control. He's coming. Relax. - Aren't you over Silvio? - Guess not. You're exaggerating, out of jealousy. He can go screw himself; so can that bitch. I thought he was out of my mind, but I was deluding myself. I still like him. Stop behaving like you're just a friend and tell him. - Are you crazy? - No. Get on. Get on! There are no two ways about it. Make a move. Last year, we made 700,000 Liras. But we were dressed alternative. I know. So we gotta defend our honour. If we get in, we can pick up chicks. Not dressed like this. I bet 50,000 Liras I can. - Bullshit! - And sell 300,000 Liras of dope. - And pick up a chick? - Right. If you do that you're the best. - I got an excuse to get in. - Take this. - There's half. - OK, later. I wanna see this. Hey, you can't come in. - Why not? - You're not from around here. I need to see a friend. - What's his name? - This isn't democratic. - So what? - It's a state school. - But we're occupying it. - Who are you? The leftwing students. - I can't come in? - No. - Fuck off! I'm coming in! - Go away. Don't touch me! Just don't touch me! Cagnetti! The fascists are here! Let's kill 'em! Valentina, the fascists are here! We'll kick their heads in! They're out back! - What now? - Let's go! Gimme the dope back. - Lay off. Here. - And half what we bet. I'll pay you in stages! - What do we do? - Look at them gypsies! - Let's charge! - They're scared! - Split up! - This way! Stop! Stop, you ugly fascist! It was my friend, not me. - Hit him, Ponzi! - It wasn't me! - Go on! - What are you doing? What the hell are you doing? Come here! - What are you doing? - It's not what you think! - Did you get him? - No. You? The bastards are fast. Never mind. - What happened? - We overpowered the fascists. - Seen Valentina? - The fascists came! - Seen Valentina? - Upstairs. Meeting time. Fascists overpowered! Everyone in the lecture hall. We have to fight the violence. - You off? - Leave me alone. - I can't believe what I heard! - You're an asshole. - Say that again! - Leave me alone. - You crazy? - Stop following me. - Why are you like this? - Why?! What have I done to you? - You told people about us. - Pathetic! Screw you, Martino! Just 'cause Silvio said so. You still believe that jerk? You went with him to get revenge? You're a loser. Come on, Marta. If you screwed him, I'll kill myself! So, kill yourself. Both of you! You're ridiculous. Control yourself. - I love you! - Well, I don't now. Got that? Forget me! So long, and screw you! Where's Silvio? He must be at home. Why? - Stay here. - It's not fair! Is chasing a 15-year-old boy with chains fair? - You're crazy. - I didn't... You had a stick, though! - A stick? - He was chasing fascists. I found a branch! Keep out of it. - Don't talk like that. - What were you trying to do? You beat up fascists, too! - Real fascists! - Yeah, right! We're nothing compared to you! You alone made history! Your fascists were more fascist! And your dad's? - Not so loud! - Yes, they were. - They wore black shirts. - Calm down. - Everything matters at the time. - Right! - Occupying school matters to you. - Butt out! You're like sheep! At 15, you still don't have a guy!! You're a loser! I'm not! Mom, say something! - Enough! - You want me to be like her! - Stop it! - And send me to San Michele! - Be quiet! - I hate you! You're the real fascists! Hi. I'm going out. - Hello. - Hello, Giulia. Giulia's sleeping over. OK. There's food in the fridge. Just warm it up. - You'll be at the hospital? - Yes, I'm on duty. You look tired. No, I'm OK. Want to talk about it? I wish you'd think of me as a friend for once... rather than your mom. I know it's not easy. So, why bother trying? Why are you always so aggressive? Look, we know you're at a difficult age. At 16, your dad and I were... You've no idea. We told our parents we hated them, too. We've all been through it. Soon it'll be your turn... and you'll be in our shoes. But till then, if you opened up more and talked to us... maybe we could break down the barriers... between parents and children. They'll always exist, Mom. Can't you see how silly this is? What a big hand! Only yesterday it was this big. Why won't you confide in me? What's happening to you? I have to sleep at school tonight. Why? There's a girl I need to see. A sweetheart? No one says that anymore! It's Ponzi. It's Martino. Come down now! OK. Is it Ponzi? - Won't be long. - You off? Just downstairs! He does as he likes. Leave us to be the parents, will you? It's hard enough. Hi, Martino. Hi, Martino. You OK? Hi, Martino. You OK? You told her everything. You screwed her! Fuck you! What a jerk. What a jerk! How's your aunt? Full of morphine. She sleeps all the time and doesn't recognise us. Can't you feel death everywhere here? Stop thinking of it. Easier said than done. But if you start thinking of death, you can't stop. Don't you ever wonder when you'll die? - No. - Well, I do. Before she got sick, my aunt felt death in her. We'd all say: "Come on, what are you talking about?" Just a sec. A few months later she fell ill. She's real bad. I'm off now. See you tomorrow. You've smoked enough. Be good. 'Bye. I feel the same. I feel death inside me. Hey, there are more cheerful things to think of. - Like what? - Think of Silvio. I have, for the last six months. Hi. D'you see? The fascists came. I was there. Seen Valentina? In the video room. Francesca and Stefano were friends before declaring their love. Yeah, but I don't dare tell him! - Tell him you like him. - Are you nuts? You have to sort this out one way or other! What if he says he thinks of me as a friend? I'll be depressed for a year. If he says that, he's a jerk. Anyway, who cares? - What do you mean? - Who cares... about those who promised me the moon? I don't care! I've forgotten 'em. But I can't forget Luca... even if he was with someone else and didn't want me... 'cause I really loved him, you see? Things like that leave a mark. So if he doesn't want me, it's OK. - Who cares? - I'm not sure you're right. May I talk to you? Be right back. Follow me. Follow me! - What's up? - Martino knows! - You don't say! Who told him? - I don't know. Who did you speak to about what happened in the archives? - Who? - Half the school. - You're a bigger jerk than him! - Me? Bunch of little kids! You disgust me! Who did you tell what I told you? You won't tell me? Filippo guessed. It wasn't my fault. You've ruined my life! Are we still friends? Answer me, Silvio. I didn't mean to! I really didn't. Valentina dumped me. Maddalena dumped me. All 'cause of her fuckin' ex! - With me, it was 'cause of Ponzi. - She told me. - It'd been going on three months! - Whore! You gotta cheat on them before they do it to you. - I still can't believe it. - Believe it. What shall I do? Do what you like, but never get involved, OK? She started it. If she hadn't kissed me, I'd feel better. I can't forget the bitch. To forget a slut, you gotta screw another one. - But I couldn't. - When Margherita left me, I did. - Did it work? - No, but I tried. Thanks! Mom was looking for you. What did you do to your eye? Would you make love to Silvio? - Yes. - Right away? Right away. I'm sick of this virginity myth. And about waiting for Mr. Right, or not doing it right away... I don't care. If Silvio wants me, I'll do it! It's revelation time! You said it. - Why not call him? - Silvio? We're not against the occupation... if it's not an excuse to cut class. - That's not it! - Even so... When we shouted, "Bourgeois scum!" We were just like them. We were less superficial. They may be less so in other ways. We were better. Not in all ways, but in politics. Patrizio... we tried to change the world... and we're more reactionary than your father. We're not reactionary at all. Are we reactionary? You fought the bourgeoisie... now you say communism's dead. Why did you take part in '68? Silvio, it's for you. - It's Claudia. - Hi. - You OK? - So-so. Did you talk to Valentina? Yes. She say anything about me? Did she say she hated me? No. She didn't say that. I really like her. Oh, yeah... - Can I ask you something? - What? Do you think it's over... or do I have a chance? - What happened? - I hung up. - Are you nuts? - I'm not the Red Cross. It's no reason to hang up. You were supposed to be strong! - We got cut off. - My phone doesn't work well. - What do you say? - Me? You must stop thinking about her. - Yes... - She doesn't care about you. - She said that? - Yes. You'll only be hurt if you go on like this. I say that, 'cause I like you. Yes, I know. Don't let yourself be fooled. You're right. Listen, if you like, we can meet up tomorrow. - Sure... - OK, 'bye. 'Bye... Thanks. 'Night. My heart's pounding! I mustn't let myself be fooled. I mustn't. Come back and talk. No, please get out. Mom, please get out. Don't stand there. Get out! Dear Jesus, stop my aunt's suffering. May You really exist and let death not be the end. Make me happy and make Silvio interested in me. You said I was the best thing to happen to you. What happened? Was it my fault? Silvio's fault? Yours? Whose fault was it? You didn't say you wanted another guy. You should have. And now you dump me. I'll find someone better in no time! Sleep well, and screw you! You said I'm a jerk. Maybe you're right. You said you didn't care about me. I'd rather not think about that. I want to sleep and wake up... in three years' time when it's all over. But you'll be forever in my mind. Our parents just needed a joint to be subversive. Yeah, all we fight against, they've already fought. It's all been said and done before. Yesterday, not one news program mentioned the Basques or the Kurds. I don't want us ever to regret what we're doing now. We won't regret a thing. Outside here, no one believes in our fight. We're all alone in here with our ideas, but we're right! I'll never become standardised. I don't want to think when I'm 30 we did nothing with our lives. I don't want to have a depressing family life. I don't want to work for the Vatican like my dad and be mediocre. We need a real enemy. At least my sister had the Cold War. What's that? Reagan's missiles were in Sicily, Russians versus Americans. We don't even have Reagan's missiles. Silvio, are you awake? You have a phone call. Open up, will you? OK. What's up? You lock yourself in now? I slept at school. To hell with my mom! What counts is freedom. The police want to evacuate us. Are you still mad? I'll pick you up later. Felli can see you at 2:30. I just spoke to him. He says a little talk would do you good. I won't see your Felli. It might tell us if we're the ones who are at fault. I want you to see him, just once. I'll pick you up at 2:00. And wake up! Chiara... She wants me to see a shrink. It's 'cause she and dad aren't getting on. Keep it to yourself. I wasn't supposed to tell you. Listen, Chiara, sorry about what I said yesterday. I didn't mean it. I'm used to it, now. And, anyway, I'm not a loser like you think. I have my own life. I just don't talk about it here. Oh? Like what? - I've had a boy for a month now. - You have? Almost six weeks. Don't tell everyone. Mom doesn't know. It's Ponzi. Hey, my sister's got a boyfriend! I'm coming. The police chief gives us two hours to leave the school. That's what I call violence! They want to standardise us, impose their ideas... their mobile phones, cars bought on credit... monthly paychecks, paid vacations, family Christmases! We want a society that's different from all that! Think we'll eat all that? Very funny. That your idea? ... is disobedience! And we will fight! You can't manipulate us! We have a couple of questions. - How long are you staying? - Forever! We're going to vote on it. Raise your hand if you're against the police state... and for the protection of our student rights. - To victory! - Forever! - How are you? - Lousy. That bitch, Valentina didn't say hi... just gave me a dirty look. Martino. Sorry about yesterday. I screwed up. She doesn't like me. Make friends? Women try to divide us, but the bitches never will. - He's really pissed. - It would've happened anyway. - You're right. Want a joint? - Let's go. We want our own space and a new school system... which respects our minds and doesn't make us identical. The only solution is to continue the struggle. One day, she says you're the only one. The next, it'll be me, and she'll have forgotten you. She'll say she was wrong, you kill yourself. Stupid bitches! The only way to keep 'em is to screw 'em for ages. So, why did Valentina dump him? The occupation collective voted unanimously to resist. We won't leave. It's the only way to make ourselves heard. - That's how it is. - If you don't, you'll be prosecuted. So what? We can't negotiate with your blackmail and ultimatums. - We'll resist. - See ya. And fuck off! Police! It's the police! Throw eggs at 'em! Come on, run! This way! What are you doing? Goddamn pawns! This way. Stop! Come on! Hands against the wall! And keep them there! Let us go! It's over. They've destroyed everything. Bastards! We really like the police of Italy... We really like 'em even though they're shitty! - Let me out! - Sit down, you! Why do you and Ponzi come here? We come here to think when we're depressed. It doesn't make it worse? It helps you think. You're cut off from the world. Can you hear that silence? Do you ever think about death? I don't know. I do. Some nights, I wake up and think about being dead... how my body will decompose... it freaks me out. What about the afterlife? I'm just afraid everything will stop and there'll be no more memory. - What memory? - The memory of our lives. How do you mean? When something good happens, you remember it. - Yes. - That's what makes it good. But if the next day you forget even your name, what's left? - Nothing. - Nothing. You were happy and you'll never know it. It was all in vain. You're right. It's the same with death. If, when you die, everything stops... you'll never know you lived the life of Silvio Ristuccia. It's as if you never existed. Amazing... Totally amazing. Foscolo was right when he said that only art is immortal. But you have to be a poet or a musician. What if you're neither? You die and are forgotten, that's what. Think I'm nuts? Actually, I don't know why I'm boring you with all this. I wanted to talk about something else. What did you want to talk about? It's very hard to say it. I don't know if I can... If you can what? Tell you! Giulia said we couldn't carry on like this. - Who? - You and me. - You and me? - Yes. I no longer see you as a friend. I pretend nothing's happened, but for six months I've felt differently. What are you thinking? That I didn't realise a thing. I know. And why me? I don't know. These things just happen. I started to feel this way the day we went to a bookstore. Remember? You bought me Arturo's Island... and I thought, if you had things in common with Arturo... I had things in common with you. I made all this up and started thinking of you all the time. I ended up believing... the two of us might even get along. I'm talking nonsense. I'm sorry. Let's go. Just one thing: Whatever you think of me... if you still see me as a friend, we can come back here. And we can think in silence, too. That's OK with me. Do you understand? But tell me right away if you don't like me, OK? OK. But I don't know how I feel right now. I know. Shall we go? Dad, I'm at the police station. Come and get me. We're accused of resisting arrest. Mom, it's not my fault, I swear. Insulting a policeman! Bullshit! I'll tell you later. Come quick. 'Bye. My dad's a big lawyer. If you get out of line, he'll get you! Mind what you say, you! Can I make a call? What do we do? It's up to you. When you know how you feel, call me. - Is Mom home? - No. Can I ask you a question? What? You said you have a boyfriend. What if a friend said he loved you? You hadn't realised a thing... and one day, he said... he'd loved you for six months, just like that. What would you do? - Well, it depends... - On what? On who the friend is. What if he's very cute and if you can talk? - I'd tell him. - Oh? What would you tell him? That it could work. So who's the girl you like? - I'm not sure I like her. - She likes you? That's what she said. But I didn't realise a thing. - Do you like her? - Do I like her? When you know, tell her right away. - Right away... - At once. Take the train or take a hike, OK? I'm home. Are you ready? Your aunts and uncles are coming. - Dad, you gotta defend us. - Quiet! No way! What's with these pigs? Defend you? You had 30 grams of hash on you! Are you crazy? They wanna standardise us. I'll change, then we'll go. You don't want to see Felli. I understand. He helped a lot when Dad and I grew apart. It's thanks to him we're still together. I'm not growing apart from anyone. You are, from us. You didn't change your trousers. They walk by themselves! Girls notice that kind of thing. We'll go in two minutes. They're coming up. Say hello. - I don't want to. - Why? Is something the matter? They're here for news? We're just waiting for her to die! - That's enough! - Go away, please. Leave me alone. I'm ready. - Well? - I'm not going to Felli's. You will, or I'll get angry! Why are you like this? I asked you nicely! I just want you two to talk. - I'm not interested! - You don't know him yet! Don't bust my balls! Don't talk to me like that, you hear? Or I'll slap you! - Let's go! - Leave me alone! You can't force him! - Can't I now? - No, you can't! - It's for your own good. - You know nothing about us! You don't know what we do when we're not home! Because you never tell me. We talk to those who understand! We don't understand you?! Chiara understands me. There are things I've never said. Such as? It's personal. Things which must stay outside. Brava! I think I'll stay outside, too! Where are you going? Alberto, tell him to talk to Felli! That Felli again? She thinks I'm crazy. She doesn't see I must live my life! No one thinks that. You're just unhappy with life. - You noticed? - Tell him about you and Felli. - You, too? - She made me. - Help any? - Nope. - You see? - You were so depressed! - After Arianna. - But you felt better. - Yeah, I met Maddalena. - Now she left him. When did you split up with Maddalena? Tell me! Nothing to tell. Don't start. Can't you see he's depressed again? No one talks to me! Am I just trash? Here we go again. It's true. I'm no use anymore! It's not true, Mom. We all love you, but sometimes we have our own problems, too. - Wait, Alberto. - You wait. I must talk to him! Everything's fucked up here! Any news? Maybe a girl. I'm not sure if I like her. She says she's liked me for six months. I didn't realise a thing. - Is she pretty? - Real pretty. There's only one thing to do: Kiss her. Kiss her? It helps you understand things. It's more intimate than screwing. Yeah? If you like that, it means you like her. If you don't, it means she'll never be more than a friend. - Easy! - I have to kiss her? That's the best way. - I'm going. - Go on. - I'm going now. - Go on, then. OK, well, I'm going. 'Bye. Thanks. Don't fall in love with her. Have fun, but don't fall in love. You'll get hurt. OK. What are you thinking? I have three children, and I feel as alone... as if I hadn't had any. I'm going out! You're always exaggerating. Even you come up with problems you won't talk about. I have the problems of kids my age. Nothing terrible. I adore you all. You're so precious to me. I'd do anything for you. So would we. Then speak to me. Don't cast me aside. Or I feel useless. You're growing to be pretty. Where did Silvio go? It's Silvio. Is Claudia in? Hang on. Silvio's on the interphone. Hello. - Yes? - Hey, Claudia, it's Silvio. - Hi. - Can I come up for a minute? Yes, come on up. Want some tea? What's up? - What are you doing? - I had to kiss you. I don't understand... I didn't realise I liked you. Hello. You making fun of me? I swear I'm not. Don't lock yourselves in. I was showing him something. - The family's here. - You're right. Sorry. We're just going upstairs. Come on. Come on. I love you, I love you. You've no idea. Want to make love here and now? - Right now? - It's now or never. Now or never. - Yes? - Coming down? What will I think of me at 16 when I'm 45, my dad's age? And what is there after death? I feel like I'll never die. To me, love is all-important. More than the fear of falling in love, of dying... than being standardised or setting the world to rights. - You OK? - And you? They kept us for four hours. My dad took the keys to my scooter. - What did you do? - I've some news. - What? - Can I still trust you? I swear I won't tell, this time. - You won't believe it. - Try me! I did it with a girl! I don't believe it. She's liked me for six months. Who is it? Where did you find her? She found me. She found me. It's hard to believe... How long did you do it for? How can you ask? Well, we always said that's what mattered most! - You said that! - We both did. So, how long? - A while... - Come on! - That's not what counts. - No? And did she like it? Did she like it? I hope so. Are you in love, too? - In love? - Yes or no? I think so. You'll be together all the time. I won't see you. My brother says love makes you suffer... Your brother talks crap. When will it happen to me? When you don't expect it. Today your turn, tomorrow mine. - It just happens. - Right. - You're big now. How's it feel? - Same as before.
