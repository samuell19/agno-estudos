Have you ever had one of those days where everything just turns to shit? This is one of those. I'm Freddy, by the way. This is The Upholsterer. She doesn't just cut up foam and leather and shit. I've seen the real reason she's called what she's called. This is Mr Spiggs. Once upon a time, I thought he was cool. This is Semo. In another life, we might have been mates. Not today. This is Roy. The dude must be on meth cos he's psycho. I'm here for this fulla... my boy Marvin. I've known him forever, and we'd do anything for each other. Which is why I'm here with a gun in each hand and a naked Samoan. Semo, how did Freddy get a gun? And why can I see your genitals? - Fucking Roy's fault. - Eh? I'm pretty sure I know what you're thinking, and if I wasn't concentrating so hard on what to do next, I'd be thinking the same thing. How the hell did we end up in this mess? Good question. This is where it all started. It was a simple job, just pick up a cake. But me and Marv, we had big ideas. We've got his cake. That's all we had to do, right? I think we should do it. - What, bail? - Nah. This. Don't you think? Nah, yeah, bro, like I said, we're here now, so... Exactly. When we pull off maybe a couple of others like this, he has to take notice of us. This is how we get a rep. And then we, like, move on up to the real money, bro. Like, you know, this is how Barry and Dean got started. Dude, they get a cut of whatever they sell. Fuckers are totally rolling in it. That's where we wanna be. Right? High on the hog. Hells yeah, bro. High on the hog! Whoa, whoa, hold up. Actually, when you really think about it, this isn't where it all started. Check us out looking all staunch.

Oh, nah, you were more than 20 minutes, so that means it's free. - But I'm not late. - 21 minutes. Sorry. No. But I still don't have it, so that means you are late, so... can I...? Everything OK, hon? Are you gonna give me my pizza or what? Well, it's timed from order to door. No money, no pizza. Stop doing that. I don't like it. - What? - Fuck off, you perv. Whoa, bro, I'm not doing anything to you. You're undressing me with your eyes. What's going on, babe? I'm hungry. He's undressing me with his eyes. - That's not cool, brother. - Hey. Can I just get my $19.50, please? - He's still doing it. - He is too. - You're a little skank! - I'm not! He's undressing you now, babe. You little tart. - You're unbelievable! - Oh, come on. You know what, pizza's on me. Oi! Get him, babe! - Get him! Smash him! - Oi! You little shit! Oh, meat lovers. - Hey, get back here! - Fuck! OK, oi! - Leave it! - Shit! That's disrespectful!

I work as many hours as anyone else, but I'm always broke. It's all just... Bullshit. Now, we've always said one day we'd be high on the hog... moneys and honeys. Still can be. How? Oh. Nah. I'm already in the door, bro. You could be too. Not happening. Nobody who ever worked an honest job ever got high on the hog. It's been, like, scientifically proven, bro. Dude's a player.

And I don't wanna be delivering pizzas forever. I want more, you know. In prison camps in the American Civil War, there was a line, and if a prisoner crossed that line, he was shot. That line was called a deadline. I always liked that word. Deadline. Meaning's changed since. But with some deadlines, there's always a risk that once you cross over it, you may never come back. You want a job? You convince me. You got 10 seconds. Nine. - Um... - Eight. Wait, what do you want me to do? Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. Ooh. One. Is it loaded, Freddy? This gun loaded, Freddy? N-No, no, no! Pulls a bit to the left. Something I should know about you, Freddy? A pizza guy was robbed a while back. So now I use that... as protection. It's my dad's. Does he know that you've got it? Nah. You stole your old man's gun? Well, it was,... you know, left to me, so... He got, like, attacked on the job. He drove cabs. Attacked? Stabbed, actually. You know, I think there might be a place for you and your little gun in this fine establishment of mine. What do you say? Right here. Pretty safe to say that right here is where the whole mess began. I should have said, "Can I think about it?" But I wanted into that world, so I was all like,... "Hells yeah, Mr Spiggs!" ♪ The things that you want to do ♪ ♪ I know something is up ♪ ♪ Something ♪ Awesome. Now we're all caught up. Let's get back to the alley, the car and that bloody cake. No way. - Why not? - It's a shit idea. Let's just stick to the plan, OK? Let's go. Open it. Is that a flare gun? N-No. Open it. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, nah, nah. - Nah, hold on. - What are you doing? Put it up. We can't show weakness. Bro, how much is in the till? Three-hundred cash, give or take. And how much is in that? Thousands. Maybe tens of thousands. See, bro, tens of thousands. Rob the ATM? How? - Can you open it? - Only the security company can. Let's just take the three-hundy. Bro, why settle for peanuts when we can just rip it out of the wall? - Dude, you can't. - Yeah, you can. YouTube... I've seen these epic fails with dudes trying to do it, and... it just can't be done. Yeah, but did they have a Sharon? - What? - The Shazza. Oh, the... That's the second dumbest idea you've ever had. - Listen to me, man. - Seriously, bro. - Look... - Seriously! - One scratch on her... - Oh, bro, it's OK. - ...he'll kill us! - It's OK! - No fucking way in hell! - That's... Whatever damage we do to the Sharon, we can fix using the ATM cash. And think about it, what's gonna impress him more... robbing a place like this or robbing a bank? Kind of. And, dude, you can put your hands down now. - You got a family? - Yes. - Kids? - Six. - Damn! - Seriously? Wow. And, what, if we steal from you, they'll be left with nothing but 2 Minute Noodles, right? Noodles if they're lucky. See, bro? Think of the kids. Oh man. - Fine. - Yes! But I'm not leaving without that crazy elephant. - Dude, stop! The cake! - Huh? The cake! Oh, yeah. Dude, we've gotta go. We gotta go now! Yeah, yeah, hang on. What do you think this looks like, a pool party? They'll be calling the cops right now! Oh, fuck. - One more time! - We gotta go, dude. One more time! One more time! Hey, whoa. What are you doing? I've got this. No, you don't. What? Well, what about the money? Fuck the money. Then how are we gonna fix the Sharon? We? This was your idea, bro. I told you! YouTube, dude! YouTube! Bro, bro, bro. Stop! The cake, bro. The cake. Oh, shit. Whoa, whoa. Glory to Ganesha! Yeah, don't fuck in my neighborhood, you bastards. An ATM. Don't you watch YouTube? Let's recap, shall we? You have, A, wrecked my car and, B, wrecked my cake, which means that you have, C, wrecked my birthday. Could get another cake. Freddy, dozens of my friends are in there celebrating my birthday. Where am I gonna get a cake at this hour that's big enough so that each of them can get a nice fat slice? Well, instead of getting one cake, you could... - get a few cakes. - Dude. What, the supermarket's still open. Supermarket cakes? Marvin and me can go and get them. That cake took days to make, and it cost me more money than you've probably made in your entire worthless fucking life. It was a spectacular cake, don't you think? Now I can't enjoy that cake. Now I can't blow out the candles and I can't make a wish. Guess what my wish was gonna be. A new car? No. We'll make it up to you. Work-Work for free until we pay you back what we owe for the cake and the Sharon. I can't go back to my old job, I don't want that life. That was my dad's life, and he worked heaps and did everything right, and look where it got him. We wanna show you what we're made of. Give us something more than... than just... picking up a cake. You know why I came to this city at the ass end of nowhere? Love. That's my wife. - She's pretty. - She's a whore. - Oh. - Eh? She broke her vows. Yeah! Marriage is sacred... sanctified, and she shat all over that. She went around screwing some... prick called Donny Kong. I want Donny dead. Dead. Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Fucking dead! Fair enough. Now, I could get Barry and Dean here to take care of it for me. But why should they get their hands dirty when I've got the two of you with a sweet little debt to pay? And you did just say you wanted to do something more. Freddy, what am I saying? What am I saying? That you, uh... you want Donny Kong, like... dead? Marvin, what else am I saying? That... you want us... to kill him. Now, Barry and Dean will give you the address and anything else you might need, and you'll do this by... noon tomorrow. High noon. Yeah, I like that. That's a good deadline. Dramatic. Let me be crystal fucking clear. You don't do this, and I'll have the boys here give each of you a permanent limp... in both legs. Probably worse. But you do do this, and we'll be all square. Square as a bear. So what's it gonna be? Square as a bear... or permanent limp? Is that even possible? To have a limp in both legs? We are so fucked. Wouldn't... one limp, like, cancel out the other? Bro, we don't do this and we're in some deep shit. Maybe we just talk to this Donny dude, make him see reason, tell him why we're there and Spiggs knows what's going on, so if he doesn't skip town, then he's a dead man. He disappears, we go back and tell Spiggs we took care of him... all good. We could, like, break down the door and, like, put a gun in his face and be, like, "Bro, leave town or we're gonna fuck you up!" Yeah, nah. You know what he'd say, don't you? "Where's my fucking beer, boys?" "Straight and narrow, son." "Straight and narrow." Wanna end up like Glen? Breaking your back for fuck all? This Donny dude is rooting the boss' missus. And you heard Spiggs. Marriage is sanctimonious. We sort this Donny dude for Spiggs and we'll be straight up set for good, bro. High on the hog. Um. Do we... Do we knock or, like... bust the door down and then take him by surprise? What if we knock and when he opens up, we, like, force our way in and, you know,... take it from there? ♪ Hush, not a word ♪ ♪ to Mary ♪ ♪ She means the world ♪ ♪ to me ♪ ♪ ...word to Mary ♪ He ain't home, bro. Yes, thank you. No, that's perfect. This is where you'll find him, and remember, Roy, it's important you don't kill him until after he tells you where it is. Not a problem, Skip. Well, fuck off, then. Dude comes home and we're already in there, we surprise him, and then, like, bam. Like jump out from behind the couch or something? Yeah, whatever's gonna work best.

Am I surprised? Actually, yes. Yes, I am. To be honest, I was sure that if anyone was gonna fuck this up and get themselves killed, it was you two. Yeah, let's view this as a kind of initiation, huh? A toast... to Donny's demise! Let's see that skinny little fuck fuck my missus now. Mr Spiggs, did you just call Donny Kong skinny in the same way you might call Marvin brainy? What do you mean? - He was fat. - What? Yeah, like, really fat. Oh, you shot a fat man? Are you guys fucking with me, are you? Huh? Are you guys fucking with me, eh?! Oh, fuck! Maybe, you know, Donny porked out since you last saw him. Wh-Wh-What he just ballooned overnight, huh? Magically beat the fuck out of his anorexia! You guys shot the wrong man, didn't you?! - Technically, he died before... - Before you what? We didn't actually shoot him. You just said that you fucking did. We just wanted you to like us. We think it was a heart attack, probably because of his size. - And the situation. - Yeah. The sitch. Whoa, whoa! Come here, you little fucks! Fuck it. - Where are you going, bro? - It's OK. Bro, where are you going? Bro, come back. I'm sorry. Did you do anything or say anything to anybody that would make it even remotely possible to trace what happened to the fat man back to me? Probably not. "Probably not." That's very reassuring, son. Nobody saw us, Mr Spiggs. Go back, get a name for the fat man. Then I want you to find Donny Kong and finish the job. You got it? Of course, yeah. Until I have a name for the fat man and Donny is picking turnips with a stepladder, then we're not square as a bear. Why would... Why would Donny be picking turnips? Dead, Freddy! Dead! Cos he'd be fucking dead! Wait. You... Now, as you know, Freddy, the deadline's still noon. If you're not back by then, I shoot Marvin's foot. Then every half hour past noon, I'll shoot him again. I'll start with the other foot, work my way up to his knees... ...his hands, and then... ...ugh... ...I'm sure you get the picture. I think he's in room 202, but I'm not too sure. Maybe you've got a register with his name in it. You a cop? I'm not a cop, really. - Are you sure you're not a cop? - I'm not. - Cos you sound like a cop. - I'm not. OK, well, if you're not a cop, then why should I tell you if your friend, if, in fact, he is your friend, is in room 202? Is your mum or dad here or...? - What's your friend's name? - Um... His name. Um... Funny thing is... I've actually forgotten his name. Oh, right. B-B-But he's... He's really large. Asian, I think. So you don't know if your friend's Asian and you can't remember his name? Room 202. It's just a name. What's that say? - Do you know what it means? - Um... Hello? Donny? Hello? ...We import so much of our food, and all the time, it's got to come up from the Northern Hemisphere; it's gotta come from the warmer climates, cos we're not very good at growing stuff. Police. Open the door, please. Open the door. Uh, just a second. Sorry. It was just kind of mess, so... We got a call that someone matching your description - broke in here. - I didn't actually break in. Jeff left the door open for me. Who the hell is Jeff? Jeff Kwok. We're hooking up today. And he said to wait here for him. He's lying. I've never heard of Jeff Kwok. Yeah, Jeff knows Donny, and he's staying here. I think that's actually his suitcase over there. What's your name? Uh, Calvin... Broadus. People call me Snoop. Got some ID, Snoop? - Sorry, no. - Oh, this is bullshit! OK, calm down. He told me that he didn't know who lives here, and he asked me for a name! I'll take it from here, OK? Is someone in there? Oh, uh, I don't... I don't think so. Actually, I wouldn't go in there. I just did a monster shit, and it's like... Whoa. When do you expect your friend to get back? Uh, soon. Maybe you should wait outside. Shit! Fuck. - It's clean? - Definitely. So you tidied up and you wiped clean everything we touched? What do you think "definitely" means? Yeah, I cleaned up and tidied everything we touched, just like your highness ordered, so can we get fucking moving? Because the skipper's waiting, and she doesn't like to be kept waiting. Fucking knew I should have done it myself. Do I look like a fucking idiot? You treat me like a fucking idiot, and I don't like it. - You don't like it? - I do not. You know, there's a saying... you teach people how to treat you. What?! Who's "they"? It's just what they say. Fuck! Fucking shit. Jesus... What the fuck are you waiting for?! - Calm the fuck down. - Come on, man! Those cops are gonna ask us fucking questions, and it's gonna fucking blow up in our faces like fucking C4. And the skip won't be happy. She won't be. - Fuck! - Roy. - Won't be happy, okay. - OK, it's all good, all right? OK, just use your breathing. Use your breathing. There, you happy? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fucking happy! Breathing. Breathing. Here we go. Chill, dog. Chill, dog. - "Chill, dog"? - What? - Who says that any more? - Everyone. - Brolax. - What? You know, "brolax". It's like the new "chill dog".

Four letters. Ends with E. Arse doesn't fit. So, it's done? Uh, kinda. Kinda done. What do you mean "kind of"? How can someone be kind of dead? He's dead. You know, he's... definitely dead. There was just no signs of a break-in or a struggle, so we figured, you know... heart attack? Yeah, I mean, a body of those proportions, you know, it was... What? Roy had a hunch. Here's my hunch. This is what happened. He ate it, and then he tries to shit it out in the bath, right? Because if he tried to shit it out in the toilet, it would go down the drain, right? So while he's trying to shit it out in the bath, the strain was so big that, boom, heart attack! Jeff ate the merchandise? - Yeah. - Yeah. So it's still inside him, and we need to cut it out. No fucking way I'm cutting him up. Which leaves... well, just you. - Me? - Hmm. - I saw a meat clever... - Hey, whoa, whoa. - Oh, what? - A meat clever? Yeah. - Yeah. - What? W-We can't do it here cos of forensics and whatnot. - Which is why... - Oh God no. - We take him to the workshop. - Right. And we let the skip do it. - He's in the van. - Oh, is he? We dressed him in a tracksuit so nothing looked suspicious. Hmm. Tell me, Roy, the room you found him in, what floor was it on? - First. - First. - Oh, so there were stairs? - Yep. And where did you park? Uh, on the street outside the motel. Oh, I see. So, let's just recreate this morning's events, shall we? So you find Jeff dead in the bathroom, and you put him in a tracksuit, then you carry him down some stairs and on to a public street, and you put him in the van. And all this takes place when? Oh, it was early-ish, eh. In broad fucking daylight! And then you drive a body the size of a small whale around the city and you leave him parked in a van outside my shop. But nothing looks suspicious, does it? I-I-It's so nice to see you brolax. What did you say? - Don't. - Brolax.

That is an outstanding question. That is the best fucking question on the entire fucking planet. That is the fucking "to be or not to be" of fucking questions, and I want it fucking answered, so get back to that fucking motel, and you fucking rip that place apart, and you don't fucking stop until you find my fucking merchandise! Why couldn't you just have eaten it like you clearly eat everything else? You think about a lot of things when you're trapped under a bed in a motel room with a guy who might want to kill you if he found out you were there to kill him for screwing your boss' wife. All kinds of stuff... random stuff, like what I'd do differently if I coached the Warriors. Other stuff too, like my dad, who didn't deserve to die, and what he might say right now. Something like, "You made a mistake, son, getting involved with Spiggs." And then he'd hug me and tell me he loved me. Then I thought about the time and the high noon thing, and the deadline and how I needed to do this for Marvin, who was always there for me. And I thought, "Yeah, Dad would understand." But then I was all like, "Man, this is really confusing." The only thing I could think to do next was pray for a miracle. Jeff? Jeff? Jeff? Tell us where it is and we'll be on our way. Fuck! Oh, righty-oh, mate. Oh, that... that's dirty. Fuck. Jesus. OK. We know Jeff stole it. And we know he was hiding out in here, which means you know why he was hiding out, which means you know where it is. So where is it? Jeff said he needed a place to stay for a while, but I don't know what you mean. Please, don't hurt me, please. - Toilet? - Yeah, yeah. - Get up. - The toilet? - Yeah, yeah, get up. Come on. - I don't need toilet! I don't need toilet! Right, toilet. - No, thank you. I don't need it! - Let's go. Where is it?! Where is what! Wrong! We know that Jeff came here after he took it! Just tell us! - Where the fuck is it?! - Oi, oi, oi, oi. - Where the fuck is it?! - Hey, hey. Wait, wait! Come. Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy. What the fuck, bro? Fuck, he's no good to us dead, is he? Come on, stay with me. Yo, bro. Hey, just tell us where it is and we'll call an ambulance. Yo. Hey, hey, hey. Come on, no, no, no. Oh shit. You always fuck things up, don't you? He should have told us. Fuck! Fuck! So what do we do now? Not gonna stick around here, that's for sure. OK, let me think. We rip the place apart, like she asked us to, OK? But we found nothing. - What about the merchandise? - Fuck the merchandise, bro. That's two dead bodies, OK, because of this fucking merchandise. I don't want to be body number three, do you? Good. Let's go. Oh, wait. Fuck, Roy, come on. - Oh, what is up with his...? - Roy! Freddy? He's gone. Who? The fat man, he's gone. What do you mean gone? Well, I got back here to the place, and he's not here. - He's gone. - Well, where is he? - I don't know. - You said he was dead! - Yeah, he was, but... - Then fucking what?! But what if he wasn't? Shit. Donny might have found him. Yeah, I-I don't think so. Well, how do you know that? Because... Donny's here. I'm looking right at him. Put him on. I can't. He's gone. Like, gone gone. - Dead gone? - Yeah. What happened? I killed him. You killed him? Yeah, so... So you can let Marvin go now, OK? And why would I do that, huh? Because that was the deal. I mean, I've done everything you asked me to, and it's before the deadline, so... So you just want me to take your word for it that you took care of Donny and expect me to let Marvin go? Well... yeah. Well, nah. I want proof. And until I get it, we're not square as a bear. So here's what I want you to do. Piece of shit! Try now! You fucking beauty! Move. Move over. OK.

Just search him. - You search him. - Just... Just do it, Roy. Eh, that... That's not my name. Frederick Winiata. Least you're not lying about your name, Freddy. - Is there anything else? - He's a donor. The wallet, dick. Where'd you get this? - I stole it. - You stole it? I can... I can sell it for 50 bucks easy to, you know, an illegal immigrant. Right. What, an oversized illegal immigrant? Yeah, I mean, probably. Freddy, just tell us where the merchandise is and we'll let you go. It's that easy. What merchandise? Where'd you put it, bitch? Did the fat guy give it to you or did the skinny guy give it to you? Where'd you put it?! Yeah, OK, he can't breathe. Hey, hey, Roy, let him go. Hey, hey. He's not gonna tell us because he knows how much the merchandise is worth. He's gonna keep to his story about breaking in because he knows we can't prove it. Isn't that right, Freddy? Shit. - Oi. - What? You thinking what I'm thinking? I doubt it. We escalate the situation. We let the skip deal with it. That's pretty good. Freddy, have you heard of The Upholsterer? - Kind of. - Kind of? Well, I think she'd kinda like to see you. Do you like horses, Freddy? Hmm? They're all right. You can tell a lot about a horse from its teeth... its age, its diet, its general health, even its possible vices, such as wood-chewing and the like. Well, people are much the same. But our vices, well, that's where you and I are quite different from a horse because our vices aren't quite so easy to detect. But we all have them, don't we? So what's your vice, Freddy, hmm? Is it drugs? Girls? Boys? And how would a young man like yourself pay for such things, hmm? Perhaps that's why you broke into the very same motel where a man who stole from me something of great value was hiding out. This gentlemen right here, in fact. What did you break into that motel room to steal? This very same man's driver's license. Which you say you can get $50 on some black market for illegal immigrants. Now, I know people have been killed for less, but $50 is not a lot of money, is it? Perhaps you took Jeff's license because he didn't have a heart attack, did he? No, you killed him somehow. Perhaps asphyxiation. And then you went back to erase any evidence that he was ever in that room. - Police. - Just a second. While you were doing that, trying to figure out where the fat man was and how the skinny man ended up dead, you were interrupted. Aw! Jeff? But tell me, son, is it worth your life? Is getting all the money you ever dreamed of, is it really worth dying for, hmm? Motherfucker! Where is it? I don't know. Maybe it's in there. Hmm? Here, take a closer look. Is it in there, Freddy, hmm? I can't hear you. No? - Where is it?! - I don't... I don't know! You could check up his date. - His what? - His date. His arse. People put some crazy shit up there. I saw this doco about drug smugglers. They get condoms, fill them full of drugs, and stick them up their bums. It's pretty amazing what you can fit up there. Roy, come and take a look. Wait. Wait. Slang for anus, four letters... "date." Give me the paper and a pen. - Hurry up. - There you go. D-A-T-E. Perfect. Right, continue. You left his phone on him? Where's your phone, Freddy? Hmm? Where is it? So, who'd be calling you, hmm? I don't... I don't know. Yes? Who's this? Who's this? Who's this? Who's this? Tell me who this is! You tell me who this is. Where's Freddy? You tell me. What? Well, where should he be? Is Freddy there or not? Who wants to know? Who the fuck is this?! Who is this?! Put him on! Well, you see, he's a bit busy. Busy doing what? Is there a message? Yeah. Yeah, here's the message. - Bang. - Bang? Freddy. Who's expecting you? - Hmm? - Nobody. Keep searching him. - Hey, hey. - Hey, whoa. What is it? What's this? Had it on him the whole time. Oh. Is that a...? Yeah, looks like it. It's kind of, um... Donny. Freddy? What are you doing with Donny Kong's penis? It's worth heaps of money in the... in the Asian market. It's used for soups. It's like a delicacy. He was dead, so... Roy killed him. I... I mean, that's where I saw it. I don't believe you've been completely honest with us, have you? Why did you deem it necessary to cut off Donny Kong's penis and put it in your pocket? I have to deliver it by noon, otherwise Marvin's gonna get shot. Ah, bang, hmm. Come on, Freddy, who sent you? Who was on the phone? It was... It was meant to be the skinny man, not the fat man, but I didn't know that. The fat man wasn't meant to be there, was... Who fucking sent you?! Ah, what a shame. Well, can't say I didn't give him fair warning, huh? No, no, no. He'll make it. He will. No, no, no, no. He'll be here. He'll make it. - He will. - Oh, shut the fuck up. No! No! Help! Help! Look at you. Look at you about to pee your pants like a little fucking girl! You're fucking crazy. - Ah. - Come again. You're fucking crazy, you fucking psycho! I thought you were fucking cool! Wait... I'm not cool? Well... Oh. Oh yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Oh! Yeah. I might be fucking crazy, but if your friend doesn't turn up in the next half hour, your other foot is gonna get the same fucking treatment! Don't let me interrupt, Mickey. The Upholsterer. Well, well, well. I think you know why I'm here. Lap dance? You know, when I heard the name Mickey Spiggs, it all made sense. I'm connected to Jeff Kwok. Jeff Kwok is connected to Donny Kong, and Donny Kong, if I'm not mistaken, is connected to you. I know what you did to Jeff, and the reason you did what you did to Jeff is because you knew that he had what belongs to me. So just hand it over and we'll be on our way. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy, all right? Just-Just take it easy. I have no idea who Jeff Kwok is, and I have no idea what the fuck you're talking about. Take a seat. Jeff is a rather large man who was killed earlier today in his place of temporary residence by Freddy, who I believe is in your employ. - The fat man? - Not only was he fat, Mickey, he was also stupid. He stole something from me. Freddy stole it from him, killed him and then gave it to you. Yeah, nah, that's not actually what happened. - Where the fuck is it? - Listen, I didn't even know the fat man existed till this morning. Oh, have I not been polite thus far? - Yeah. - Have I not been reasonable? - Yeah. - Yeah. I think I have. You see, being polite and reasonable about this is plan A. If you do not hand it over, you will force me to go to plan B. And plan B is not so polite and reasonable. But let me try and persuade you to stick with plan A, because I really hate to make a mess unnecessarily. So, first you need to know two things. One, if the merchandise is not back in my possession within the hour, I will execute you. Yeah. And, two. - Pa-ching. - One of my men is outside in a van with Freddy, who will also be executed should plan A fail. So what's it going to be, Mickey? Plan A, everyone lives, or plan B, not everyone lives? It's entirely up to you. Hey, let Marvin go! Semo. How did Freddy get a gun? And why can I see your genitals? Fucking Roy's fault. Gum? I'm cool. Hey, uh, your dad drive a cab? Why? Did you know him? No, not really. Bro. - How did you...? - Hands on your head! OK. OK, just take it easy, Freddy. Give me your gun. Give me your gun! OK. Get out. - Now take off your clothes. - Eh? I wanna see if that's all you're carrying. - That's everything. - Do it! There you go, Freddy. Everything. Oh, come on! Now back to the end at the beginning. Or is it the other way? What do you want, Freddy? Go and untie Marvin. Semo, don't you move. Do you know why they call me The Upholsterer? I know it's not a razzle-dazzle name like Ms. Untouchable or Bonnie Bamboo, but it fits. You see, because I like to make people feel comfortable. Now, to make you comfortable, I assume I'd have to let you and Marvin leave here intact. Yes? For me to feel comfortable, I need to leave here with my merchandise. So why don't we just make each other comfortable, hm? OK, yeah. I have it. Marvin leaves and you get it back. No, the merchandise first. OK, but... we do this without guns. We all put them down. You're dreaming, mate. Well? Where is it? Safe. Roy. But then he can just shoot us. Oh, I think Freddy knows that would be a mistake. Put... your... gun... down. Put your fucking gun down. Your other gun, Freddy. Frederick Winiata. How did you know him? How did you know my dad?! He was a good man, reliable... mostly. Liked the ponies. He worked for you? Of course he did. A pick-up or a drop-off every now and then. Well, he had the perfect cover, didn't he? Why'd he die? Does it matter? You do look a bit like him. You can put it down. I didn't kill him. I don't believe you. Don't believe what... that he worked for me or that I didn't kill him? Well, what if I did, hmm? What if he owed me a shit ton of cash? What are you gonna do about it? You gonna fuck me up? Avenge his death? Go on, then. Be as stupid as he was. Fuck this! Holy shit, I'm gonna die! That's what I should be thinking right about now, but that's not what went through my head in this moment. What went through my head was, "If only the fat man was skinny." Well, this is it. This is how my shit day ends. What would you do... pull the trigger for Dad? Or would that make me just like her? She does deserve it. Nah. Shit, Marv! Hey, hey, Marv. - Is it over? - Yeah, we gotta go. - Guess it's possible, bro. - What? I think I got a limp in both legs. It's not what it looks like. Wait, wait. Wait, seriously, we had nothing to do with this. All we did was try and pay back Spiggs. This was all The Upholsterer. She was saying Spiggs stole something from her, and it... got, like, kinda crazy, and Marvin's been shot in the leg, and... I've got to get him to a doctor pronto. Hey, Spiggs is dead, dudes. That makes you in charge, right? We doing this or what? Yeah, bro. We don't take risks, we get nowhere. It's all good, bro. I got this. Marvin and me never did find out what the merchandise was, but I still think about what it might be and where it might be. Like, is it back at that motel? Could be. And I think about breaking in and finding it, but then I'm like, "Nah, I never want to go back into that room. All those fullas got killed over it." So we're gonna stay on the straight and narrow. Yep, we got big plans. I'm gonna turn this shit around, Dad. Make you proud and show you I can do it. They say there's dough in pizzas if you get it right, so me and Marv are gonna learn the ropes, save hard and start our own franchise. We're gonna be high on the hog. You wait and see. Yeah, it'll take a while, but we're gonna get there. We're gonna tear it up, baby! Hells yeah!
