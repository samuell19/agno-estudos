You've got them mixed up. -You're making a mistake. -I can't hear you. You're making a mistake with the reindeer! Would you mind stepping out for a moment? Open the door! I'm sorry, the store isn't open... I don't want to buy anything, and I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I wanted to tell you, you're making a serious mistake. With the reindeer, I mean. You've got Cupid where Blitzen should be. And Dasher... Oh, Dasher should be on my right-hand side. -He should, huh? -Yes, yes. Oh, and another thing. Donner's antlers have got four points instead of three. I don't suppose anybody'd notice it except myself. No, I don't suppose so. -Well, bye. Thanks. -Not at all. Glad to have helped you. Bye. Jingle bells, jingle bells You're on float number three. You're on the pilgrim float. -You three are on the pirate float. -Mrs. Walker, something's got to be done. That three-men-in-a-tub float isn't big enough. -The butcher and the baker are in, but -I'm sorry, but I've got enough to do. Oh, dear, I was so hoping... George! I beg your pardon. You seem to have got slightly mixed-up with this whip of yours. -Allow me, will you? -Thank you, sir. It's quite simple, really. -You don't mind if I show you, eh? -No, sir. Now then. See, it's all in the wrist. You have to follow through. -Is that so? -Yes! It's just like throwing a ball. If you were to... You've been drinking. It's cold. A man's gotta do something to keep warm. You ought to be ashamed of yourself! Don't you realize thousands of children are lining the streets waiting to see you? Children who have dreamed of this moment. You're a disgrace to the tradition of Christmas. And I refuse to have you malign me in this fashion. Disgusting. -Tell me, who's in charge of this parade? -When you find out, you tell me. These pants are gonna fall off in the middle of Columbus Circle. I beg your pardon. Could you tell me who's in charge here? Yes, Mrs. Walker. There she is, down there. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Oh, you two ought to be on 81st Street. One of the men in your parade is not fit... What are you doing out of costume? Get dressed. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were our Santa Claus. Your Santa Claus is intoxicated. -Oh, no! -Yes. It's disgraceful. How can you allow a man? Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way Stop that! You know drinking's not allowed! In this cold, a man's gotta do something to keep warm. I'll warm you. I ought to take this cane... And I ought to... Somebody! Julian, get some black coffee. -Plenty of it. -Yes, Mrs. Walker. Black with a little cream. Wake me up when the parade starts. Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way Shameful. Absolutely shameful! Could you be Santa Claus? Have you had any experience? -A little. -Oh, please. You've got to help me out. Madam, I'm not in the habit of substituting for spurious Santa Clauses. -No. No, I... -Oh, please! Oh, well, the children mustn't be disappointed. -All right. I'll do it. -Good. Thank you. Come right this way. Get that costume. He's wonderful! He didn't need any padding. -What? -Padding. He didn't need any padding. -Where did you find him? -I turned round and there he was. I'm glad you turned round. I'm glad he was there. Just think if Mr. Macy had seen the other one. Just think if Mr. Gimbel had seen the other one. -You want a ride? -I'm going home and getting in a hot tub. And I might stay there until next Thanksgiving. You should see the parade. You worked so hard on it. If I want to, which I doubt, I can see it from my apartment. That's right. You live down the Mrs. Walker! Susan. Susan? -Hello, Cleo. -Hello, Mrs. Walker. What a beauty. Where's Susan? -She's watching the parade. -Where? With whom? With that Mr. Gailey who lives in the front apartment. Oh, yes. Oh, I've been keeping an eye on her. She can see everything from there. That's the 50-yard line. He's so very fond of Susan. When he asked me, I didn't think you'd mind. Well, I guess it's all right. I'll go on in, in a minute. They're having trouble with the baseball player. He was a clown last year. They just changed the head and painted him different. My mother told me. He certainly is a giant, isn't he? Not really. There are no giants, Mr. Gailey. Maybe not now, Susie. But in olden days there were a lot of... What about the giant that Jack killed? Jack? Jack who? Jack. Jack. Jack and the Beanstalk. I never heard of that. You must have heard of that. You've just forgotten. It's a fairy tale. Oh, one of those. I don't know any fairy tales. Your mother and father must've told you a fairy tale. No. My mother thinks they're silly. I don't know whether my father thinks they're silly or not. I never met my father. My father and mother were divorced when I was a baby. That baseball player looks like a giant to me. People sometimes grow very big. But that's abnormal. I'll bet your mother told you that too. Hello. I'm Susan's mother. Yes, I know. Come in. Susie's told me quite a lot about you. -I'm Fred Gailey. -Yes, I know. Susan's told me quite a lot about you too. -Hello, Mother! -Hello, dear. -Won't you have a cup of coffee? -Oh, don't bother. -It's no bother. It's all ready. -Well, in that case, thanks. -What do you think of my parade? -It's much better than last year's. I hope Mr. Macy agrees with you. Sugar? Cream? Both? Neither? Just one sugar, please. -This is very kind of you, Mr. Gailey. -Sit down. Thank you for being so kind to Susan. Cleo tells me you took them to the zoo yesterday. That's right. But I must confess it's part of a deep-dyed plot. I'm fond of Susie. Very fond. But I also wanted to meet you. I read that the surest way to meet the mother is to be kind to the child. What a horrible trick. It worked. There goes Santa Claus. -Don't even mention the name. -He's much better than last year's. At least this one doesn't wear glasses. This one was a last-minute substitute. The one I hired, I fired. Why? You remember the way the janitor was last New Year's? Oh, yes! Well, this one was much worse. I see she doesn't believe in Santa Claus either. No Santa Claus, no fairy tales. No fantasies of any kind. -Is that it? -That's right. I think we should be realistic and truthful with our children. And not have them growing up believing in legends and myths -like Santa Claus, for example. -I see. That's the end. The acrobats were good. They ought to be, at those prices. Thanks for the coffee. -And thank you for inviting me in. -It was a pleasure, missy. Mother, I was thinking. We've got such a big turkey for dinner and there are only two of us. Couldn't we invite Mr. Gailey? Couldn't we? -Well. -Oh, don't even think about it. -I'll have a sandwich or something. -It's an awful big turkey. That's not it, dear. I'm sure Mr. Gailey has other plans. No, he hasn't. Have you? To be truthful with the child, I must admit I haven't any other plans. -Please, Mother. Please! -I don't wanna interfere... Did I ask all right? Didn't I ask all right, Mr. Gailey? That all depends. -Dinner's at 3. -Thanks. Susie, honey, you asked just right. I'll see you at 3. -It worked! -Yes. Mrs. Walker, he's stupendous. Everybody's crazy about him. So is Mr. Macy. Well, hire him, by all means. It's perfectly all right with me. As a matter of fact, it'll save me a frantic search in the morning. Yes. That's right. I'll take care of it as soon as he gets through. You'll love him. With that man on the throne, my department will sell more toys than ever. He's a born salesman. I just feel it. Yes, yes, yes. We'll talk about it in the morning. Goodbye. Goodbye. And you'll find toys of all kinds at Macy's. -Gee, that sure is an elegant costume. -Yes. I've had it for years and years. Sure makes a bum out of the one they gave you. But even that one's better than the one I wear. -You, Alfred? -Yeah, I play Santa Claus at the Y. -No kidding! -Started about three years ago. They had a costume but, well, it didn't have no padding and since I carry my own padding with me, I got the job, see? You enjoy impersonating me? -Oh, yeah. -Why? I don't know. When I give packages to little kids I like to watch their faces get that Christmas look all of a sudden. It makes me feel kind of good and important. There you are. There you are. Good morning. -Morning. -Now, before... My, what a striking costume. I just want to give you a few tips on how to be a good Santa Claus. Go right ahead. Here's a list of toys that we have to push. You know, things that we're overstocked on. Many children will be undecided as to what they want for Christmas. When that happens, you immediately suggest one of these items. Understand? I certainly do. Good. Now, you memorize that list and I'll... Oh, no. I'll tell you. When you've finished, come up to the seventh floor. I'll be waiting for you. Imagine making a child take something it doesn't want just because he bought too many of the wrong toys. That's what I've been fighting against for years, -the way they commercialize Christmas. -Yeah, there's a lot of bad "-isms" but one of the worst is commercialism. Make a buck. Make a buck. Even in Brooklyn it's the same. Don't care what Christmas stands for. Just make a buck. Make a buck. Don't bother. I'll put it away for you. Yeah? Thank you, Alfred. -What shall I do with these? -Throw them on the floor. I get kind of tired just sweeping up dust. Thanks. Thank you, Alfred. This way, please. Yes. Yes, yes, Peter's a fine name. What do you want for Christmas, Peter? I want a fire engine like the big ones, only smaller. It has a real hose that squirts real water. I won't do it in the house, only the back yard. I promise. Macy's ain't got any. Nobody's got any. I can tell you're a good boy. You'll get your fire engine. Oh, thank you very much! -See? I told you he'd get me one. -That's fine. That's just dandy. Listen, you wait over there. Mama wants to thank Santa Claus too. What's the matter with you? You understand English? Macy's ain't got any. Nobody's got any. I been all over. My feet are killing me. Fine thing, promising the kid. You don't think I'd have said that unless I was sure, do you? You can get those fire engines at Schoenfeld's on Lexington Avenue. -Only $8.50. A wonderful bargain. -Schoenfeld's? I don't get it. I keep track of the toy market pretty closely. Does that surprise you so? Surprise me? Macy's sending people to other stores? Are you kidding me? The only important thing is making the children happy. Whether Macy or somebody else sells the toy doesn't matter. -Don't you feel that way? -Who, me? Oh, yeah, sure. -I didn't know Macy's did. -As long as I'm here they do. I don't get it. No. I just don't get it. Right this way, please. This way, please. Oh, I quite understand. Your little girl would like some skates. Of course, you must get her the best. Their little ankles want protecting. We've got skates, and they're good, but not quite good enough. Go to Gimbels. They'll have what you're looking for I'm sure. Gimbels? -That's for you. Merry Christmas! -Gimbels. Hello, my good girl. How are you? Gimbels? Gimbels! Pardon me. You're the head of the toy department, huh? Yes, but at the moment... I wanna congratulate you and Macy's on this wonderful new stunt you're pulling. Imagine, sending people to other stores. I don't get it. Why, it's... -It certainly is. -You said it. A big outfit like Macy's putting the spirit of Christmas ahead of the commercial. It's wonderful! I've never done much shopping here before, but I'll tell you one thing from now on, I'm gonna be a regular Macy customer. Thank you, madam. There are six more women out there who wanna thank you. Not now. I've got to think this thing over. Personally, I think it's a wonderful idea too. You think so. Those women think so. The point is, will Mr. Macy think so? This seems awfully silly, Mr. Gailey. I thought as long as we're in the store, you might say hello to Santa Claus. Why? Because when you talk to him, you might feel differently about him. Goodbye, Albert. Be a good boy, now. Merry Christmas! -Young lady, what's your name? -Susan Walker. What's yours? Mine? Kris Kringle. I'm Santa Claus. Oh, you don't believe that, do you? You see, my mother's Mrs. Walker, the lady who hired you. But you're the best-looking one I've ever seen. -Really? -Your beard doesn't have -that thing going over your ears. -That's because it's real. Just like I'm really Santa Claus. Oh, go ahead. Pull it. All right, don't crowd. You have all day to see Santa Claus. Children, behave. This way, please. Get back in line. And now, what would you like me to bring you for Christmas? -Nothing, thank you. -Come now, you must want something. Whatever I want, my mother will get for me if it's sensible and doesn't cost too much. -Hello, Mother. -Hello, Susan. Mr. Gailey. You've taken up enough of this gentleman's time. Come along, dear. The explanation for this is all very simple. Cleo's mother sprained her ankle, so she asked me to bring Susie to you. I know. Cleo called me. I wondered where you were. I thought we'd say hello to Santa Claus. He's a nice old man, Mother. And those whiskers are real! Yes, yes, dear. Many men have long beards like that. Susan, would you stand over here? I want to talk to Mr. Gailey. I shouldn't have brought Susie to see Santa Claus, huh? Now I feel like the proverbial stepmother. I'm sorry, but I couldn't see any harm in just saying hello to the old fellow. I think there is harm. I tell her Santa's a myth and you bring her here. She sees gullible children, meets a convincing old man with real whiskers. This sets up a very harmful mental conflict within her. What will she think? Who will she believe? By filling them with fairy tales, they grow up considering life a fantasy. They keep waiting for Prince Charming to come along, and when he does, he... We were talking about Susie, not about you. Whether you agree or not, I ask you to respect my wishes regarding Susan. She's my responsibility, and I must bring her up as I see fit. Okay. -Say thank you. -Thank you. Bye. Merry Christmas! Young lady, what's your name? She doesn't speak English. She's Dutch. She just came over. She's lived in an orphan's home in Rotterdam ever since. We've adopted her. I told her you wouldn't be able to speak to her. But when she saw you in the parade, she said you were Sinterklaas as she calls you, and you could talk to her. -I didn't know what to do. -Hello! Now do you understand? -Yes, I see what you mean, Mother. -Good. But when he spoke Dutch to that girl, he was so... Susan, I speak French, but that doesn't make me Joan of Arc. What I'm trying to explain to you is... Come in. -You wanted to see me? -Come right in. -Hello! Good to see you again. -It's nice to see you. You're awfully lucky. Lovely little girl you have here. Thank you. She's the reason I asked you by. She's confused, and I thought maybe you could help out. I'll be glad to. Would you please tell her that you're not really Santa Claus? That there actually is no such person? Well, I'm sorry to disagree. Not only is there, but here I am to prove it. No, no, no. You misunderstand. I want you to tell her the truth. -What's your name? -Kris Kringle. -I'll bet you're in first grade. -Second. -I mean your real name. -That is my real name. -Second grade? -It's a progressive school. Oh, it's a progressive school. May I have this gentleman's employment card? This dress is cute. Where did you get such a lovely outfit? Here at Macy's. We get 10 percent off. Don't feel you have to pretend for Susan's benefit. She's very intelligent and always wants to know the truth. Good. I always tell the truth. About your school. What's your teacher's name? -Mrs. Haley. -Mrs. Haley. -Here it is, Mrs. Walker. -Thank you. ... he kept talking all the time. -My, that was bad, eh? -Yes. Mrs. Haley made him rest all alone for nearly an hour. Susan, would you go out and talk to Miss Adams for a minute -and I'll be right with you? -All right. Goodbye. Goodbye. Hope to see you again. -Thank you. I hope so too. Bye. -Goodbye. -I'm sorry, Mr.? Mr.? -Kringle. -I'm sorry, we have to make a change. -Change? The Santa Claus we had is back, and I feel we owe him... -Have I done something wrong? -Oh, no. No. Well... -Yes? -Mr. Macy wants to see you immediately. I'll be right up. Would you sit down, and I'll be right back and sign your pay voucher. Yes, indeed. Go right in. Mr. Macy's waiting. The effect this will have on the public... Come in, Mrs. Walker. -Hello, Mrs. Walker. -Sit over here. I told these gentlemen about the policy you and Shellhammer initiated. I don't approve of your not consulting the advertising department but with this tremendous response on the part of the public I can't be angry with you. -What's he...? -Tell you later. To continue. On the face of it, this plan sounds idiotic and impossible. Imagine, Macy's Santa Claus sending customers to Gimbels. But, gentlemen, you cannot argue with success. Look at this. Telegrams, messages, telephone calls. The governor's wife. The mayor's wife. Over 500 thankful parents expressing gratitude to Macy's. Never in my entire career have I seen such an immediate response to a merchandising policy. And I am positive, Frank, that if we expand our policy we'll expand our results as well. From now on, not only will our Santa Claus continue in this manner but I want every salesperson to do precisely the same thing. If we don't have what the customer wants, we send him where he can get it. No forcing a customer to take something he doesn't really want. We'll be known as the helpful store. The friendly store. The store with a heart. The store that places public service ahead of profit. And consequently, we'll make more profits than ever. Yes, I know it's late and we're all tired and we want to go to dinner. We'll continue in the morning. In the meantime, figure out the best way to promote this thing. We'll do that. Good night, R. H. -Good night. -Good night. I wanna thank you two again. In your Christmas envelopes, you'll find an expression of my gratitude. -Thank you, Mr. Macy. -Tell Santa I won't forget him either. Yes, Mr. Macy. Imagine. A bonus! He assumed it was our idea, so I... What's the matter? -I fired him. -Who? -Santa Claus. -What? He's crazy. He thinks he is Santa. I don't care if he thinks he's the Easter Bunny. He's insane, I tell you. We'll just hire somebody else to do the same thing. You heard Mr. Macy. We've got to keep him. What if he has a fit or something? No, I've got to tell Mr. Macy. But maybe he's only a little crazy. Like painters or composers or some of those men in Washington. He needs to be examined. If you fire him and we find out he wasn't crazy Mr. Macy will have us examined and fired. I suppose we ought to be sure. -We could have Mr. Sawyer talk to him. -Of course! He's a psychologist. He's paid to examine employees. Until we get his report, we'll say nothing. -I'll get in touch with him right away. -But first get that Santa Claus back! The examination won't be worth a thing without the patient. It was just because I felt we owed it to him but Mr. Macy suggested that we find something else for him and keep you on by all means. Oh, well, thanks. That's mighty good news. Yes. -You'll be here in the morning, then? -Certainly. You see, this is quite an opportunity for me. I've been getting more and more worried about Christmas. We're all so busy trying to beat the other fellow in making things go faster, look shinier and cost less that Christmas and I are getting lost in the shuffle. I don't think so. Christmas is still Christmas. Christmas isn't just a day. It's a frame of mind. And that's what's been changing. I'm glad I'm here, to maybe do something about it. And I'm glad I met you and your daughter. -You two are a test case for me. -We are? You're the whole thing in miniature. If I can win you over, there's still hope. If not, then I guess I'm through. But I'm warning you, I don't give up easily. -Good night. -Good night. Oh, Mr. Kringle! In the morning, can you report to Mr. Sawyer? Sawyer? Yes. He'll just give you a little examination. -We do it with all our employees. -A mental examination? Well... I don't mind. I've taken dozens of them. Never failed one yet. Know them by heart. "How many days in the week?" Seven. "How many fingers do you see?" Four. "Muscular-coordination test." No damage to the nervous system. "Who was the first president?" George Washington. "Who was the vice president under John Quincy Adams?" Daniel D. Tompkins. And I'll bet your Mr. Sawyer doesn't know that. Good night. Miss Adams, would you get me the Brooks' Memorial Home in Great Neck? It's a home for old people. That's right. I want to talk to the doctor in charge. -How many days in the week? -Seven. -Who was the first president? -George Washington. -What is three times five? -You asked me that before. You'll find the answer right there... I'm conducting this examination. What is three times five? The same as it was before: 15. You're rather nervous, aren't you, Mr. Sawyer? Do you get enough sleep? My personal habits aren't your concern. I'm sorry. I hate to see someone tied up... How many fingers? Three. Oh, you bite your nails too. Stand with your feet together and your arms extended. -Then I want you... -Muscular-coordination test? Surely. Be glad to. Sometimes the cause of nervous habits like yours is not obvious. No, often they're the result of an insecurity. Are you happy at home? That will be all, Mr. Kringle! Examination's over. You may go. -Thank you. -You may go out that way. And I've been happily married for 26 years. Really? Delighted to hear it. Goodbye. Get Mrs. Walker. Yes, sir. And your wife's on 672. She says it's important. Agnes, I've told you not to bother me at the office. No. Not a penny. I give you a liberal allowance. If that fat, stupid brother of yours got a job, you wouldn't pester me. Mrs. Walker, I'd like to talk to you about Kringle. Yes. Dr. Pierce from the Brooks' Home is here, and we can settle the matter. Sorry, doctor. That was Mr. Sawyer, the man I told you about. -Oh, yes. -He'll be right in. We appreciate your giving us your time, doctor. Not at all. As a matter of fact, I was going to call you today. I had a feeling you'd be wondering about Kris. -Dr. Pierce, Mr. Sawyer. -How do you do? After giving this man a thorough examination I believe he should be dismissed. Really? He failed to pass the examination? -Yes. -He didn't answer correctly? Yes, he did, but there was no concentration. He kept changing the subject. He was even questioning me. There's no doubt about it. He should be in an institution. I don't agree. People are institutionalized so they won't harm themselves or others. Mr. Kringle is incapable of either. His is a delusion for good. -He only wants to be friendly. -I feel that too. Many people walk around with similar delusions who live normal lives. A famous example is that fellow. I can't think of his name, but he insists he's a Russian prince. There's evidence to prove him wrong, but nothing has shaken his story. Is he in an institution? No. He owns a famous restaurant and is respected. Dr. Pierce, I've made a great study of abnormal psychology and I've found that when a delusion is challenged the deluded can be violent. -I disagree with you. -But I... If you tell Kris there is no Santa Claus he'll argue the point, but he'll not become violent. His manner suggests aggressiveness. The way he carries that cane! He's never without it. He carries a cane, but you're not implying he'd use it as a weapon? Mrs. Walker, I can't discharge this man. That's up to you. You asked for my opinion, and I've given it. When he exhibits his latent maniacal tendencies, and he will please realize the responsibility is yours. Speaking of delusions. We're back where we started. No, we're not. Dr. Pierce makes me feel perfectly confident. Yes, but if anything happens, you won't get blamed, I will. Nothing is going to happen. What I've said wasn't prompted by my affection for Kris. -My specialty is geriatrics. -Huh? The diseases of old age. I'm experienced, and I assure you Kris has no "latent maniacal tendencies." You'll probably wanna discuss this, so I'll be on my way. -May I see Kris? -Certainly, doctor. -Use the employees' elevator. -It's the one you came in. Where is that? -I'll show you. -That isn't necessary. You understand my position, doctor. If there's the slightest possibility of his getting into any trouble... What trouble could he get into? All that's got to happen is for a policeman to ask him his name. A big argument. Clang, clang. Bellevue. You can prevent that. Someone here could rent him a room, then they could ride to work together. I'd prefer he didn't take that long train ride to Great Neck. That'd solve everything. Someone to steer him away from trouble. Take custody of him? Would he agree to that? I'm sure he will. -In that case, he can stay. -Good. Thank you. It's the seventh floor, and thank you very much. -Welcome. -Bye, doctor. I'm sure you made a wise decision. Let's see, who could rent him a room? You. Your son's away at school. What about his room? I don't mind. I'd be glad to but Mrs. Shellhammer wouldn't like it. She's a little... Say, I have an idea. We have martinis before dinner. I'll make them double-strength tonight. After a couple of them, she'll be more receptive to the idea. Kris is finished at 6:00. What about the in-between time? Take him home, and I'll call as soon as my wife's plaster... Feeling gay. -Oh, no. I... -Really! If my wife has a big headache tomorrow, you can have a little one tonight. -All right. -It'll only take about an hour. Good. Very good. What games do you play with the other children here? I don't play much with them. They play silly games. They do? Today, they were in the basement playing zoo, and they were animals. When I came down, Homer... He was supposed to be the zookeeper. He said, "What kind of an animal are you?" And I said, "I'm not an animal. I'm a girl." He said, "Only animals allowed. Goodbye." So I came upstairs. Why not tell him you're a lion or a bear? Because I'm not a bear or a lion. But the others were only children, and they pretended to be animals. But that's what makes the game so silly. I don't think so. Sounds like a wonderful game to me. Of course, in order to play it, you've gotta have an imagination. Do you know what the imagination is? Sure. That's when you see things that aren't really there. Well, that can be caused by other things too. No. To me, the imagination is a place all by itself. A separate country. You've heard of the French nation and the British nation. Well, this is the imagination. It's a wonderful place. How would you like to be able to make snowballs in the summertime? Or drive a great big bus right down Fifth Avenue? How would you like to have a ship all to yourself that makes daily trips to China and Australia? How would you like to be the Statue of Liberty in the morning and in the afternoon, fly south with a flock of geese? It's very simple. Of course, it takes practice. Now, the first thing you've got to learn is how to pretend. And the next time Homer says, "What kind of animal are you?" You tell him you're a monkey. -But I don't know how to be a monkey. -Sure you do. Here, I'll show you. Bend your body over a little. Let your arms hang loose. See? Put your right hand up here, under here. That's right. Now scratch yourself. That's right. Then put your tongue under your lips, over your teeth. -Like this? -Like that. That's right. Then scratch yourself and chatter. See? Haislip, Haislip, Sherman, Mackenzie, and Haislip have been kind to me. But being an exceptional lawyer, I want my own office. Would you put this in Susan's place for me, please? I think you can take the meat out. It should be done. Don't forget to scratch. Put your tongue up in front of your teeth. Talk to other monkeys. What's going on here? We're just having our first lesson in pretending. Doing quite well at it too. That's right. Come on now. Call the other monkeys. You're a goose. No, you mustn't be a goose, be a monkey! -Mr. Kringle. -Yes? Mrs. Walker mentioned that they're looking for a room for you in town. Dr. Pierce doesn't want me to make that long trip every day. Well, I was just thinking. I'm all alone in my apartment. Twin beds. Plenty of room. If you'd like to move in with me, I'd be happy to have you. That's awfully nice of you. You could ride to and from work with Mrs. Walker, and... Yes. It'd give me a chance to really talk things over with her. Don't forget to scratch. You're not scratching. You're not... Besides, I could see Susie now and then. Mr. Gailey, it's a deal. Good. We'll drive out after dinner and get your things. Thanks. Hello? Oh, yes, just a moment. It's a Mr. Shellhammer. Thanks. Hello? Hello, Mr. Shellhammer. Yes, just a moment. Mrs. Shellhammer wants to talk to you. I made the martinis triple-strength, and she feels wonderful. Here, my pet. Thank you. Hello? -Hello? -No, no, no. No, dear. Thank you, darling. Hello? No, no, no, dear. There. Oh, darling! How silly of me. Hello! Why, we'd love to have Santa Claus come and stay with us. I think it would be simply charming! Oh, and so do I, Mrs. Shellhammer. Just a moment. The Shellhammers have a lovely room, and want you to stay with them. That's very sweet of them. Please thank them very much. But I'm going to stay with Mr. Gailey. Mr. Gailey? I think I'd better get the meat. I understand, but there must be something you want for Christmas. Something you haven't even told your mother about. Oh, come on now. Why don't you give me a chance? Well. That's what I want for Christmas. A doll's house, like this? No, a real house. If you're really Santa Claus, you can get it for me. If you can't, you're only a nice man with a beard, like mother said. Wait a minute, Susie. If every child can't get his wish, that doesn't mean there's no Santa Claus. That's what I thought you'd say. Don't you see, dear? Some children wish for things they couldn't possibly use. Like real locomotives or B-29s. But this isn't like a locomotive or a B-29. It's awful big for a little girl. What would you do with a house like this? Live in it with my mother. -But you've got this lovely apartment. -I don't think it's lovely. I want a back yard with a great big tree to put a swing on and... I guess you can't get it, huh? I didn't say that. Well, it's a tall order but I'll do my best. May I keep this picture? -Thank you. Good night, Susan. -Good night, Mr. Kringle. Nice place you've got here. Was I lucky to get it! You like living in Manhattan? It's all right. Someday, I'd like to get a place on Long Island. Not a big house. One of those junior partner deals around Manhassett. I know just the kind of place you mean. One of those little colonial houses. Either that or a Cape Cod. I think you're right about Mrs. Walker. A little more effort from you and she might crawl out of that shell. Take her out to dinner or the theater. I've tried, but she's always busy with her job. Well, try a little harder. Those two are lost souls, and it's up to us to help them. I'll take care of Susie, and you, her mother. -It's a deal. -Ready? No, you don't. I'm not gonna be cheated this way. All my life I've wondered something and now I'll find out. I want the answer to a question that's puzzled the world. Does Santa Claus sleep with his whiskers outside or in? Always sleep with them out. Cold air makes them grow. -We're running out of books. -I'll get some right away. And I need some more Wanamakers. Yes, I know just what you want. We don't carry that brand but I think Gimbels does. Let me see. Yes, here it is. I thought I noticed it before. $2.98. Looks like an exceptional bargain. -Yes, it does. Thank you. -Not at all. Not at all. Why didn't one of you think of this idea? It's the greatest goodwill policy I ever heard of. Every shopper in New York City thinks of Macy as a benevolent soul. Thinking only of the welfare of the public. And what does that make Gimbel? A profiteering money-grubber. Two can play this game. If we haven't got what the customer wants, send him back to Macy's. And do the same in our stores in Philadelphia, Milwaukee and Pittsburgh. Get to work on it right away. So Gimbel's doing it in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Milwaukee, eh? Yes, and very successfully. Well, we can cover the country too. Notify our stores in San Francisco, Atlanta, Toledo and Newark to get going right away. All right, Mr. Macy. -Look this way, Mr. Gimbel. -Hold it, Mr. Gimbel. Now we'll take some at my store. Just a minute. I have something I'd like to give our friend here. This is a little something to show my appreciation for all you've done. Thank you, Mr. Macy. That's very kind of you. I didn't think you were that generous. That's a bit of money. What are you gonna do with it? I have a friend. A doctor. He's been very kind to me. He needs an x-ray machine. I don't think that's going to be enough. I better give you some... I'll make up the difference. Buy it here and get 10 percent discount. I can get it for cost. -Good night, Susan. -Good night, Cleo. Like me to sing you a little good-night song? If you want to. Doesn't your mother ever sing to you at night? Why should she? No reason. I just think it's kind of nice that... -Do you like Market? -All right. To market, to market to buy a fat pig Home again, home again, jiggety-jig To market, to market, to buy a fat hog Home again, home again, jiggety... Amazing! Do you happen to have a spare piece? Well, here goes. -Hello, Alfred. -Hello, Kris. How about a game of checkers after lunch? Not today, Kris. I don't feel like it. What's the matter? Nothing. Nothing. Something is wrong. What is it? Remember I told you how I like to play Santa Claus at the Y and give out packages to the young kids? I was telling that to Mr. Sawyer, see? And he says that's very bad. Sawyer? You mean... That's the one. He's a psychologist, you know? Well, that's a debatable point. Why is it bad? Does he say? Sure. He says that guys who dress up like Santa Claus and give presents do it because when they was young they must have did something bad and they feel guilty. So now they do something good to make up for it, see? It's what he calls a "guilt complex." How old are you, Alfred? Seventeen. You haven't had time to be guilty of anything but overeating. It's nothing to laugh about, Kris. It's pretty serious, he says. It's rubbish. Don't listen. He knows what he's talking about. He's been studying for a long time. What's the basis of this guilt complex you're supposed to have? Does he say? Well, he ain't found out yet. It's probably way down inside of me someplace, see? Something that happened to me when I was a baby, he says. It takes time, but he'll do it. You mean you're going to him again? Sure. I go every day for a little while after lunch. He don't soak me nothing. He's doing it for free because I'm an interesting case. Yes. What else has he found wrong with you, Alfred? Anything else? No. Oh, just that I hate my father. I didn't know it, but he says I do. And he sees you every day? Yeah, I just sit in a chair and say anything that comes into my head. A few things have just come into my head, and I'm going to say them. What do you mean, bursting into my office like this? -Are you a licensed psychiatrist? -None of your business. I have respect for psychiatry and great contempt for meddling amateurs who practice it. You have no more right to analyze Alfred than a dentist has to remove a gallbladder. -I beg your pardon! -Your job is to give intelligence tests. Passing yourself off as a psychologist. You ought to be horsewhipped. Taking a normal boy like Alfred, and filling him with complexes... I'm better equipped to judge that than you are. Just because he's kind to children, he has a guilt complex? Having the same delusion, you can't understand. The boy is maladjusted, and I help him. Maladjusted! You talk about maladjusted! The patient is running the clinic. I won't stand... Leave immediately. Either you stop analyzing Alfred, or I go straight to Mr. Macy and tell him what a fraud you are. Get out before I have you thrown out. There's only one way to handle a man like you. You won't listen to reason. You're heartless. -You have no humanity. -Are you going to leave? Yes. -Kris? -Mr. Sawyer! Mr. Sawyer, are you all right? Look at that bump! Mr. Sawyer! He's unconscious. Get a wet towel. -No, better get a doctor. -Mr. Sawyer? You must've done something to him. I tell you, we were merely talking. But when I mentioned Santa Claus, his delusion, he became violent. I told you he had latent maniacal tendencies. I think this proves it. Let Dr. Pierce examine him again. Dr. Pierce? He doesn't know. He's a general practitioner. This is rather serious. You better get a good psychiatrist. But he's taken dozens of those examinations and passed them all. Well, in view of this, it's possible his condition has changed. I don't think we can take any chances. I can't see the harm. If he passes, he can return to work. And if he doesn't, it's better we find out. -I suppose. -Examine him right away. Before he tells Mr. M... Before Mr. Macy finds out. Oh, my, yes. You explain to Mr. Kringle. You're his friend. I can't do it! I'm very fond of him and this is like saying he's insane. You don't call this normal, do you? No, but there are other old people who aren't normal either. This is going to hurt Kris deeply, and I don't want to be the one to do it! I don't think that would be fair to him. I'll tell him the truth. I believe in being truthful. If you mention a psychiatrist, it's attacking his delusion. He's apt to become violent. In front of the children? That would be terrible. Get him out of the store on some pretext. Once outside, I'll explain it to him. All right. If you think it's better that way. Please keep a straight line. All day to see Santa Claus. -Mr. Kringle. -Yeah? Mrs. Walker says we're taking publicity pictures this afternoon down at the city hall. You and the mayor. Good! Like to meet him. Few things I'd like to talk over with him. But I've made an appointment with Mr. Macy at 4:00. -I want to tell him something. -You'll be back in time. There's a car waiting for you downstairs and it's drizzling. I'll get your coat. Thanks. I'll be right with you. Just want to take care of a few of these kiddies first. -Where to? -Bellevue. Bellevue? Did she know about this? Yes. We all discussed it. "The second party shall hereby agree to be conveyed by the first party..." Excuse me, Gertrude. Telephone. Hello? Yes. Yes. Why, yes, we share an apartment together. Bellevue? But why, doctor? What did he...? Oh, he's quite comfortable. He'll be with us for a few days and he was wondering if you could bring over his things. Yes. Yes, in view of his examination I'm afraid I shall have to recommend commitment. I know, Mr. Gailey, but I'd rather speak to you in person. I'll be right over, doctor. See the new patient. -Thanks. -Not at all. -Hello, Kris. -Fred. Why'd you do it, Kris? You deliberately failed that examination, didn't you? Why? Why? Because the last few days, I've had great hope. I had a feeling Doris was beginning to believe in me. Now I find out she was only humoring me all the time. I just talked to her on the phone. She didn't know about pictures with the mayor. That was Sawyer's idea. Well, I'm glad of that. -But why didn't she explain? -She didn't want to hurt you. But only because I was a nice, kind, old man, and she was sorry for me. -That's not true. -Yes, it is. She had doubts. That's why she was just sorry. If you were here instead of me, she'd have been furious. All right. She had doubts. Why not? She hasn't really believed in anything for years. -You can't expect her... -It's not just Doris. It's Sawyer. He's contemptible, dishonest, selfish, deceitful, vicious. Yet he's out there, and I'm in here. He's called normal, and I'm not. If that's normal, I don't want it. That's why I answered the questions wrong. But, Kris, you can't just think of yourself. What happens to you matters to a lot of other people. People like me, who believe in what you stand for. And people like Susie, who are just beginning to. You can't quit. You can't let them down. No. I suppose I shouldn't. Maybe someday the Sawyers will be in here instead of out there. You're right. I ought to be ashamed of myself. Even if we can't win, we can go down swinging. Let's get out of here. Wait a minute. You forget you flunked your examination but good. Oh, yes. I forgot. I said Calvin Coolidge was the first president. I can imagine what they're thinking of me. But you'll get me out of this. It's not gonna be easy. It will be for you. You're the greatest lawyer since Darrow. You're putting me in an awful spot. I believe in you. You can't let me down. But you don't understand, it... I'll do everything I can, Kris. -Thank you. -Goodbye. Bye. That's a lot of nonsense! Dangerous, my foot! If he failed 10 examinations, you had no right to do it. Get the case dropped, or you'll have another lump to match the one that Kris gave you. Yes, Mr. Macy. "Age: Unknown." Old man, huh? Very old, Your Honor. I suppose I'll have to read all this. Take my word for it. Routine commitment papers, cut and dried. The man calls himself Kris Kringle. Thinks he's Santa Claus. Come in. Mr. Gailey to see you. He represents Mr. Kringle. Better show him in. Good morning. There seems to be undue haste in this case. -I wish to protect my client's rights. -Of course. I request a formal hearing to which I may bring witnesses. -You said this was cut and dried. -I didn't know about a protest. You may sign the commitment papers, but I shall bring in a habeas corpus. There's no point in signing. We'll have a hearing on Monday morning at 10:00. Thank you, Your Honor. Good day. Thank you. That man, I heard him say something about Mr. Kringle. Who is he? His name is Gailey, Kringle's lawyer. Probably trying to get publicity. We can't have that. Mr. Macy wants to drop the whole thing. It's too late. Kringle was examined by psychiatrists. -It has to go through the routine. -We must avoid publicity. Mr. Gailey? I represent Mr. Macy. My name's Sawyer. -Oh, so you're Sawyer? -Yes. Regarding this Kringle matter, we're anxious to avoid publicity. Naturally. So if you'll put this matter through quietly we'll find a generous way to express our appreciation. -Very interesting. -Then you'll cooperate? Very interesting. Publicity? You know, that's not a bad idea. If I'm to win this case, I'll need public opinion, and plenty of it. And publicity's just the way to do it. Thanks, Mr. Sawyer. Oh, Mr. Gailey! Mr. Gailey, wait a minute. Mr. Gailey, one moment, please. I don't see what they're making such a fuss about. After all, he's an old man... How've you been feeling lately? You look rundown. Me? Why, I feel fine. Never better. Why don't you see the doc? Take a few weeks off. Go fishing. Go hunting. -Why should I? -Because this Kringle case is dynamite. Let a judge handle it that isn't up for reelection. -I can't do that. -Listen, I'm no legal brain trust. I don't know a habeas from a corpus, but I know politics. That's my racket. I got you elected, didn't I? And I'll try to get you reelected. I know, Charlie. Don't misunderstand me, I appreciate all you've done. -Then get off this case. -But why? Because you're Pontius Pilate the minute you start. I don't believe it. I'm an honest man. Nobody will hold it against me for doing my duty as I see it. Grandma! Grandma! Good night, Terry. Good night, Alice. Now, straight to bed. I promised your mother you'd be in bed by 8:00. -Aren't you coming too? -I'll be up to tuck you in. Scoot! Now, how about a great big kiss for Grandpa? Fine way to treat their grandfather. No hug, no kiss, no anything. I don't blame them, any man who puts Santa Claus on trial for lunacy. See what I mean? Hey! Don't worry, I've got the best lawyer in the world. -How long will this take? -Maybe a week. A week! That's impossible. All that has to be done... That lawyer won't let him admit anything. He'll deny it all. I'll bring witnesses and he'll bring witnesses. Hear ye, hear ye. All persons having business with the Supreme Court for New York County draw near and give your attendance, and ye shall be heard. In the matter of Kris Kringle, the commitment papers are before you. Your Honor, I'd like to call the first witness. Mr. Kringle, will you take the stand? Good morning, Your Honor. You do solemnly swear that the testimony you're about to give shall be the whole truth, so help you God? I do. I want to explain to the witness that this is a hearing, not a trial. Mr. Kringle, you don't have to answer any questions against your wishes or even testify at all. We have no objection, Your Honor. I'll be glad to answer any questions that I can. -What is your name? -Kris Kringle. -Where do you live? -That's what this hearing will decide. A very sound answer, Mr. Kringle. -Do you believe you're Santa Claus? -Of course. State rests, Your Honor. Mr. Gailey, do you wish to cross-examine the witness? I believe he was employed to play Santa Claus. Perhaps he didn't understand the question. I understood the question perfectly. No further questions at this time. Thank you. In view of this statement, do you still wish to put in a defense? I do, Your Honor. I'm fully aware of my client's opinions. That's the entire case against him. All these tests and reports boil down to this: Mr. Kringle is not sane because he believes he is Santa Claus. An entirely logical and reasonable assumption, I'm afraid. It would be, if the clerk or Mr. Mara or I believed that we were Santa Claus. Anyone who thinks he's Santa Claus is not sane. Not necessarily. You believe yourself to be Judge Harper. Yet no one questions your sanity because you are Judge Harper. I know all about myself. Mr. Kringle is the subject of this hearing. Yes, Your Honor. If he's the person he believes himself to be just as you are, then he's just as sane. Granted. But he isn't. -But he is, Your Honor. -Is what? I intend to prove that Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus. He's crazy too. -Hello! -Hello, darling. Sorry I'm late. I reserved our table at Luigi's. -We're gonna celebrate. -Celebrate? "Gailey Throws Bombshell on New York Supreme Court." -I read that. -I didn't see this. Front page. Good, good. -You're not serious about this? -Of course I am. But you can't prove he's Santa Claus. Why not? Macy and Gimbel shook hands. That wasn't possible, but it happened. -Honestly! -It's the best defense. -Completely illogical and unexpected. -And completely idiotic. What about your bosses, Haislip and Mackenzie? What do they say? That I'm jeopardizing the prestige of an established law firm and either I drop this case or they'll drop me. -See? -I beat them to it. I quit. -You didn't! -Of course I did. I can't let Kris down. He needs me, and all the rest of us need him. Look, darling. He's a nice old man, and I admire your wanting to help him. But you've got to be realistic and face facts. You can't throw your career away because of a sentimental whim. But I'm not throwing my career away. But if Haislip feels that way, so will every other law firm. I'm sure they will. I'll open my own office. And what kind of cases will you get? Probably a lot of people like Kris. That's the only fun in law anyway. I promise, if you believe in me and have faith in me, everything will... You don't have any faith in me, do you? It's not a question of faith. It's just common sense. Faith is believing in things when common sense tells you not to. It's not just Kris on trial, it's everything he stands for. Kindness, love and the other intangibles. You talk like a child! It's a realistic world. Those lovely intangibles aren't worth much. You don't get ahead that way. What's getting ahead? Evidently you and I have different definitions. We've made some wonderful plans. Then you go on an idealistic binge. You give up your job and security, then expect me to be happy about it! Yes, I guess I expected too much. Someday you'll find your way of facing this realistic world doesn't work. And when you do, don't overlook those lovely intangibles. You'll discover they're the only things that are worthwhile. These reporters make me look like a monster who drowns cats and tears wings off butterflies. This man... Tommy, go in and get Mother's scissors, will you? They're in the bedroom. That's a good boy. Don't discuss this case in front of him. It would break his heart. And I agree with the reporters. Mr. Kringle's a nice old man. I don't see why you're persecuting him. Firstly, I'm not persecuting him. I am prosecuting him. And secondly, I like the old man too. Wish I'd never gotten into this. But it's too late. There's nothing I can do. It's up to the state of New York. I'm just their representative. Kringle's been declared a menace by competent doctors. It's my duty to protect New York and see that he's put away. No matter what they may say about me, I must do it. Sometimes I wish I'd married a butcher or a plumber. My dear, if I lose this case, it's possible that you'll get your wish. Hello, Kris. -Your name? -R. H. Macy. You own one of the biggest stores in New York City? The biggest. If you recognize the gentleman there, tell us who he is. -Kris Kringle. -Your employee? -Yes. -Is he truthful? Yes. -Do you believe he's of sound mind? -I do. Mr. Macy, you're under oath. Do you really believe he's Santa Claus? Well, I... He gives every indica... I asked you, do you really believe that this man is Santa Claus? I do. That's all. Psychologist! Where'd you graduate from, a correspondence school? You're fired. I object to this testimony. It's ridiculous and irrelevant. Gailey's made a circus of this court. There's no such person as Santa Claus. I submit it's purely a matter of opinion. Can Mr. Mara offer proof that there's no Santa Claus? No. I don't intend to. This isn't a nursery it's the state supreme court, and I won't waste its time. Mr. Mara seems to have appointed himself judge. He's ruling on what testimony I may introduce. We request an immediate ruling, Is there or is there not a Santa Claus? Well... The court will take a short recess to consider the matter. I don't care what you do with whisker-puss but if you rule there's no Santa, start looking for the chicken farm now. We won't be able to put you in the primaries. But, Charlie, listen to reason. I'm a responsible judge. I've taken an oath. How can I seriously rule that there is a Santa Claus? Why don't you lis...? All right. Tell them the New York State Supreme Court rules there's no Santa Claus. It's all over the papers. Kids read it and don't hang up their stockings. What happens to the toys that are supposed to be in those stockings? Nobody buys them. The toy manufacturers will like that. They'll have to lay off a lot of their employees. Union employees. Now you got the CIO and the AF of L against you. They're gonna adore you for it, and they're gonna say it with votes. And the department stores are gonna love you too. And the Christmas card makers and the candy companies. Henry, you're gonna be an awful popular fella. What about the Salvation Army? They got a Santa Claus on every corner, and they take in a fortune. But you go ahead, Henry. You do it your way. You go on back in there and tell them that you rule there's no Santa Claus. Go on! But if you do, remember this: You can count on getting two votes. Your own and that district attorney's out there. The district attorney's a Republican. All rise! Before making a ruling, this court has consulted the highest authority available. The question of Santa Claus seems to be a matter of opinion. Many people firmly believe in him. Others do not. The tradition of American justice demands a broad and unprejudiced view of such a matter. This court therefore intends to keep an open mind. She'll hear evidence on either side. He's crazy too! The burden of proof of this ridiculous contention rests with my opponent. Can he produce any evidence? If Your Honor please, I can. Will Thomas Mara take the stand? -Who, me? -Thomas Mara, Jr. Hello, Daddy. Here, Tommy. Tommy, you know the difference between telling the truth and lying? Gosh! Everybody knows you shouldn't tell a lie. Especially in court. Proceed, Mr. Gailey. Do you believe in Santa? Sure I do. He gave me a brand-new Flexible Flyer sled last year. -And this year... -And what does he look like? There he is, sitting there. Your Honor, I protest. Overruled. Tell me, Tommy why are you so sure this is Santa Claus? Because my daddy told me so. Didn't you, Daddy? And you believe your daddy, don't you? He's an honest man. Of course he is. My daddy wouldn't tell me anything that wasn't so. Would you, Daddy? Thank you, Tommy. Goodbye, Daddy. Your Honor... Don't forget, a real, official football helmet. Don't worry, Tommy. You'll get it. The state of New York concedes the existence of Santa Claus. But in so doing, we ask that Mr. Gailey cease presenting personal opinion. We could bring in witnesses with opposite opinions. But it's our desire to shorten this hearing, not prolong it. I therefore request that Mr. Gailey now submit authoritative proof that Mr. Kringle is the one and only Santa Claus. Your point's well taken. I'm afraid we must agree. Are you prepared to show that Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus on the basis of competent authority? Not at this time. I ask for an adjournment until tomorrow. Court stands adjourned till tomorrow at 3:00. Well, I... I guess that's that. There's a way, Alfred. There's got to be. Well, it's hard to explain. They're having sort of a trial about him. -You mean like for a murder? -No, it isn't that kind of a trial. It's just because he says he's Santa Claus. But I've got a feeling he is Santa Claus. Some people don't believe that. That's why... But he's so kind and nice and jolly. He's not like anyone else. He must be Santa. I think perhaps you're right. Is Mr. Kringle sad now, Mother? I'm afraid he is. I'm sure he misses you... Then I'm going to write him a letter right now and cheer him up. Hey, Lou. -Come here. -Yeah. Here's a new one. I seen them write to Santa, North Pole and South Pole. Here's a kid writes, "Kris Kringle, New York Court House." -Can you beat that? -He's right. They got him on trial. He claims he's Santa, and the DA claims he's nuts. Here, read it for yourself. Right on the front page. How many Santa letters we got at the dead-letter office? I don't know. There must be 50,000 of them. Bags and bags all over the joint, and there's more coming in every day. -Hey, Lou. -Yeah? It'd be nice to get rid of them, huh? Yeah, but... Hey! That's a wonderful idea... I mean, why should we be bothered with all that stuff? Why don't you get a couple of big trucks. Load them with Santa mail and deliver it to Mr. Kringle at the courthouse. Let somebody else worry about it, huh? Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way -Hello, Kris. -Fred. Kris, I'm afraid I've got bad news for you. I've tried every way to get some competent authority. I've wired the government, the mayor, even... This is worth more than all the governors and mayors in the world. It's all over. Look at him. He hasn't got a thing. And furthermore the defense has yet to offer one concrete piece of evidence to substantiate this claim. Not one competent, authoritative proof that this man is Santa Claus. In view of these facts, and especially since today is Christmas Eve we're all anxious to get home I ask that you sign the commitment papers without delay. Mr. Gailey, have you anything further to offer? Yes, I have, Your Honor. I'd like to submit the following facts in evidence. It's the post office an official agency of the United States government. The post office was created by the 2nd Continental Congress on July 26, 1776. The first postmaster general was Benjamin Franklin. The post office is one of the largest concerns in the world. Last year, under Robert Hannigan, it did a gross business of $1,112,877,174. I'm sure we're all gratified to know the post office is doing so nicely. But it has no bearing on this case. It does, if I may be allowed to proceed. By all means, Mr. Gailey. The figures I have just quoted indicate an efficiently run organization. Furthermore, the United States postal laws make it a crime to willfully misdirect mail or intentionally deliver to the wrong party. Thus, the department uses every possible precaution. New York is second to none in its admiration of the post office. It is efficient and authoritative. We are very happy to concede Mr. Gailey's claims. -For the record, Mr. Mara? -Anything to get on with this case. -I want to introduce this evidence. -I'll take it, please. I have three letters. They're addressed simply, "Santa Claus." No other address whatsoever. Yet they've been delivered to Mr. Kringle by bona fide employees of the post office. I offer them as positive proof... Three letters, Your Honor, are hardly positive proof. The post office receives thousands of these letters every year. I have further exhibits, but I hesitate to produce them. I'm sure we'll be very happy to see them. Yes, yes, produce them, Mr. Gailey. Put them here on my desk. -But, Your Honor... -Put them here on the desk. -Put them here. -Yes, Your Honor. Your Honor! Your Honor! Your Honor, every one of these letters is addressed to Santa Claus. The post office has delivered them. Therefore, the post office, a branch of the federal government recognizes this man, Kris Kringle, to be the one and only Santa Claus. Since the United States government declares this man to be Santa Claus this court will not dispute it. Case dismissed. I've gotta get that football helmet. Thank you so much, Your Honor. And a very merry Christmas to you. Thank you, Mr. Kringle. And the same to you. Thank you. -Kris. -I had to wait to tell you. -I got your note. It made me happy. -Oh, I'm so glad. We're having a big Christmas party at the Brooks' Home. Breakfast, a beautiful tree and. I'd like to have you and Susan. Thank you. I can't think of anyone I'd rather spend Christmas with. Would you like to come to dinner tonight? Tonight? Oh, I can't. It's Christmas Eve. Oh, I forgot. Bye. Oh, my dear sir. You know my assistant Alfred, Mr. Macy? -Merry Christmas. -Mr. Macy. There's something I'd like to show you. Mr. Macy! Kris, the state Supreme Court declared you to be Santa Claus and, personally and professionally, I agree with them. But there's lots of presents for you. Not the one I wanted. Not the one Mr. Kringle was going to get for me. -Well, what was that? -It doesn't matter. I didn't get it. I knew, but I thought there'd be a letter or something, telling me. -I don't suppose you want to talk to me. -Something about a present... Yes, I know. I'm sorry, Susie. I tried my best, but... It's because you're not Santa Claus. That's why. You're just a nice old man with whiskers, like my mother said. I shouldn't have believed you. I was wrong when I told you that, Susie. You must keep believing in Mr. Kringle. You must have faith in him. But he didn't get me the... That doesn't make sense, Mommy. Faith is believing in things when common sense tells you not to. Just because things don't turn out the way you want the first time you've still got to believe in people. I found that out. You mean it's like, "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again." -Yes. -I thought so. -May I drive you home? -Thank you. If you'll go this way, you'll miss a lot of traffic. You go along Maplewood to Ashley. I believe, I believe. It's silly, but I believe. -That'll be fine. Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas to you. And to you, my dear. Goodbye, my dear. -Bye, Mrs. Walker. -Goodbye, Alfred. Goodbye, Susie. This must be the turn here. That's right. Ashley. Now you go straight for four blocks. I believe. Stop, Uncle Fred, stop! Stop, stop! Susie! Susie! Susie, where are you going? What is she doing? Susie! Susie! -Susie, where are you? -I'm upstairs! You know you shouldn't run around in other people's houses. But this is my house, Mommy! The one I asked Mr. Kringle for. It is, it is! I know it is. My room upstairs is just like I wanted it. You were right. Mommy told me if things don't turn out the way you want them to you still got to believe. And I did, and you were right, Mommy. Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus. -Where are you going? -To see if there's a swing! There is one! There is one! You told her that? The sign outside said it's for sale. We can't let her down. I never really doubted you. It was just my silly common sense. It even makes sense to believe in me now. I must be a good lawyer. I take a little old man and legally prove to the world that he's Santa Claus... Oh, no. It can't be! It must have been left here by the people that moved out. Maybe. Maybe I didn't do such a wonderful thing after all.
