Just weeding the begonias. [phone ringing] [exhales] [laughs] How did you do that? State of mind. I am now the Shogun Warrior. [chuckles] You didn't waste any time. It's still not quite right, though. Why's that? Come with me. Careful. I am being careful. [inhales sharply] - Did I do it? - No, no. You're all right. Not a scratch. [music playing] I had a husband once. He used to run a second hand car business. You know, he'd buy an old wreck for 50 quid, do it up and sell it for 40. Very astute, he was. Did you leave him? No. No, he died. One minute he was there, and the next. [snaps finger] Couldn't even pronounce what killed him. About a fortnight later, I woke up and-- I know this sound terrible, but I thought, "That could have been me." Really terrified me. So I sold up, I got in the car,that's all I kept, that car. And I just stuck a pen in the map. That was four years ago. And I've been sticking pins in maps ever since. When that call comes,why don't you come with me. Don't tempt me. I mean it. What's that thing? Ladder of swords. Oh. [chuckles] [chuckles] What's happening? [sighs] Oh, Alice I-- I was gonna tellya about this when the time was right, honest to God. It was-- God it was years ago! All this! It was a stupid mistake. I-- I-- I-- I got caught up on something, and I did somebody a favor. It was stupid, but it was nothing. Alice? You've been asking me to drop everything and follow you God knowswhere, and you're on the run! Christ, it wasn't even me! This was a life time ago, all of this. [phone ringing in the distance] I was a different person then. You're a differentperson every five minutes. Eugene Sullivan, Don DeMarco, now you're a fucking Shogun Warrior. I don't know who the hell you are. This is crazy. I was gonna tell me everythingall in the proper time. - Why didn't you tell me before?- Wait. - Why didn't you tell me before!- Stop a minute! Wait! Will you just hang on. Don't go!I'll be back in a minute. It looks worse than it is, I promise. Hello? Yeah. Vinny! [gasps] [EXCITEDLY] You're bloody jokin'? [sighs] Oh my God. Uh, hang on, Vinny.
