Vladislav Taldykov Go! Denis Shvedov Konstantin Strelnikov Aleksei Komashko Sergei Zharkov Sergei Sosnovsky Sergei Belyaev in L I V E Story, Direction and Music by YURI BYKOV Layda, come! Come! Let's go, there's nothing at all. What a shitty day it is! Pooh, damn it. Come! Crank up! Crank up! Man, start the engine! Get in! Drive! What the hell is it? A war? Sorry, sorry... Shells! - In the pouch belt. More... What is going on? Why don't you answer, are you deaf or what? Hey, I'm talking to you. Alright, you may stay like that! Well, what was it all about? Did they want to kill you? Give me a ride in the forest. I'm serious. Me too... Don't get so fancy. Man, why the fuck to ask questions? It?s none of your business. You better keep driving. Where to? Back to the town. This is it! Fuck! We need to come around. - How? Back to the forest. Take a different way. - No way back! Go ahead, you mutton-head! Didn't have enough? Want some more? - No way here, it's a swamp! We'll get stuck. I said go ahead! Well, it'll be on you then. Would you get out? - Why? It'll be easier to get through. - Uh huh, you're telling me. Do you think I'm gonna leave you? - I don't think nothing. I could have left you before. Near the forest... - You better go ahead! Adherence will be better. Alright then. Well, come on, my girl! Go, go you junk, come on fucking bucket! What's the problem, you lemon. Come on, honey, be a good girl! Go, you slut, go. Gash bucket. - Be a good one. Come on, uh-uh-uh, come on. Bitch, go, go. This is it! We're screwed now. Fucking junk! - Hey stop it, stop it! Is it far to town? - You mean walking? - Any choice? It'll take us the whole day. - Can you show the way? Yes I can, this way. - No, we need a defilade - gully and bush. Well, I need to think. - Do it quickly. Where to go, which direction? And my car, do you say I have to leave it as it is? Put it into your pocket. - I am serious. Are you nuts, man? We're shit out of luck, while you're fussing over this crap. Alright, wait a second. Hey what are you doing? - Here's some bread and sausage. What sausage? Why are you wasting time? - Just wait! I need a tool to rip it out. - Are you really crazy, dumbass? We've got no time, why the fuck you need this player? I've just bought it! Do you care to buy me a new one? What are you doing? - Shut up, prat! Do you wanna live? Which way? There. - Run! Run! - Run! Run! That's it! I can't no more! No more! I can't! - Go the extra mile. No, I can't run any more, better shoot me! I can only walk. What the fuck you mean, walk? Look around. Come on, let's run at least to the bush. No way! I don't need a yoke on my neck, man. I'm not gonna tow you on me! Then run alone, I'm squeezed, I better die. Fuck you! Wait! Wait on me, wait! You are kinda anchor... There is about 40 km to town. You surely can't run all day through? Yes, I can. They will find your rattletrap and realize we're walking. If they're off after us, we're doomed. Believe me, fellow, I know this area very well. We will walk where the car can't access. They'll quarter around for some time - and go home. - They won't. Chasing us here is like looking for a mouse in the field. Whatever, they're gonna fight bear. They'll rake it through under every fir-tree. Wrong people and wrong case! Well, you'll get away faster alone. But you'll be rambling around a day and a night without me. And who knows if you succeed. It's up to you to decide. OK, you screwed me down. We will walk. Take off the pouch belt. A railway is somewhere around. You know, coal trains for power plants, repair teams rolling up and down. We may stop one of them. - We'll see. Listen to me now. It's gonna be challenging. And you seem to be a paper-belly. So you get your shit together now, not to fizzle out later. And I must warn you... No blabbing, no shrieking. Only talk when required. Be all eyes and ears. If you hear any strange sounds or rustles, you tell me at once, got it? Yeah. Mikhail. - Better show the way! So, how should I call you now? No name. If I need you, I'll call you myself. You are kinda weird. There's still such a long way to go together, while you're refusing to tell me your name. What's the point? When we get to the town, I'll erase you from my memory. How come? - That's the way it is. How's about thanking me? - What for? Are you not ashamed of yourself? - No. What a foul man you are! - Everybody's the same. Who everybody? - You, for instance. Look, I saved your life, didn't I? Enough, fellow. - Scared? Are you scared? Don't shoot, don't. What, are you gonna sing me a song about your family and kids? We are all heroes until we face a shotgun. Would you leave if those three got me then? Would you? - I was alone against them three, what could I do? But they were about to kill a human-being, would you leave at all? You are a complete stranger to me, should I really die for you? Would you leave then, say it? - Yes! There you are, fellow, I can't see a light above your head. So, I owe you nothing. You are nobody to me, and I am nobody to you. That's how we decide. Where the fuck did you bring us? The field is by far too big. It can't be by-passed. We have to cut it across. There's no other way to go. Who said "The car can't access!" Give me. What the hell is it? - Vodka. Are you nuts? I'm all nerves through the day. You idiot! If you get drunk, you'll lose the wits and prudent fear! We must keep an eye out every second, but instead you're gonna get wasted. Just one sip to destress myself! Look, my hands are shaking and so is the motor. Stop it! It's over. Get down! Who's over there? Our friends. Do you see a gully over there? Just as they pass behind the bush, we get up and run as fast as we can. If we can't, it's the end of the game, there's no hideout in the field. Ready? - Yes. Run! Run, run, you slut! Fiercely, creep, fiercely. Come on, move it, move it! OK, OK. - Are you stuck? Run! I'm running, yes I am. - Fiercely! I can't, because of my heart. Fiercely, you fool! OK. Sticky like shit they are! What for? - Fair enough. Get lost. My shotgun! And do not follow me. What am I supposed to do now? - Go mushrooming. Damn you. Hey fellow? Holy shit! Fuck it. Hey, guy... Hey, guy, are you OK? Fellow, you just tell me what can I do for you? Are you unwell? Oh goodness! Motherfucker. Hold on. What was wrong with you? Not your business. - Poor creature. Save your compassion. Are we going down? - Yes. No other way? - What other way! - A normal one! The one you promised. Instead you're leading through pits and ditches. And here we need a chute at all to drop with. Are you freezing on me? I didn't mean it. - Possibly. Get lost... Of course, I did mean it! No other business I have, than dragging around here with you. Are we good buddies with you? Am I having fun here in a pleasant company? Besides that I got into this mess, you are a perfect bore sniveling all the way. At every trifle, you begin shrieking, battering and cursing. I didn't promise you a parquet floor to town. Sorry, this place is for hunting, not to live it up with chicks. Look, you duffer, are you aware where to go at all? What? You may be afraid that I'll walk out. - Fuck you... Gee! Angry with me? I used to go hunting here with my dad, but you telling me such things, puppy. I hoofed every inch of it here. Hey...hey, where are you going? Come on. In your face! Come on, stop showing off. Get off me! I had something broken... I'll break your neck if you don't get off me. Well, let me see my shotgun... - Make me. Show it to me, I'll see from your hands, give me... Oops, there's a scratch on it... - What a scratch? You scraped it all over - buttstock, barrel. So deep scratches! Holy cow! Is this a tragedy, what? - Is it not? Made of gold, eh? Will you cry now. - Shucks. You stringbean...you goon. Listen, hey you! Just like a crybaby... It needs some varnish here, and polish the barrel a bit. Don't bullshit me! Just don't. I know myself what can be done and what can't. Why should I've given it to you? If you had it, hold it firmly like a man. Couldn't find your arse with both hands? You can't even dream of what I used to hold in my hands. Your dildo, you mean? Fucking warrior. You can't even hold a lousy shotgun! But you dropped on me first. [Singing] Hear me, my sweet one, Hear me, my nice one... My evening glow, my abiding love... Am I bothering you? - Not at all. What's so joyful? Well, not really. Just to distract myself. I see. Here we are. Lunch break. They won't break for lunch. - But we will. We must eat to keep alive. Sit. Here you are. Take it, I say. Listen, do you have a family? Wanna have a chat? Why not? There seems to be nothing else to do? Who knows how far it is still to go. Shall we hold our tongues? Nope, I'm not poking my nose into your business. Just interesting, in broad terms. A family, you say? Well then, I have one. Any children? - What, kids? How many? Three. Wow, so young but made it! It's not very difficult, is it? It depends... My wife and I were awaiting the first kid for 6 years. We thought there wouldn't be Lord's grace. I recall once she got up in the night giving up. Her eyes like big balls, vomiting nonstop, so she was embracing the w.c. bowl till dawn. And there was her mother's birthday party the previous night. She went on praising her meat-in-jelly. I'm not a fan of it, but my wife really lapped it up. Well, I was thinking so many thanks to mother. We called the ambulance in the morning... And the doctor told us she was pregnant. I recall there were flower beds near the hospital. I got an armload of flowers - straight to the ward! And then we drank with the doc... He was so young, first he was refusing to drink. But who can stop me? I made the entire shift dead drunk. Nurses, birth attendants... So when she delivered the first boy, we planned no more kids. Yeah... Yes...but now she's pregnant with the third, they say it's gonna be a boy, too. The two older ones are boys. And what about you? I've got all three gals. So, what we do... Just as the track begins to tremble, it's rolling down. We must stand still and don't move an inch. They will signal and tootle, but we stay glued where we are. If they realize we're scared, they will not stop. Tell me, what is your lay? What do you mean? You never feel at a loss. You know perfectly well what and how to do. Your wingding, too. Somebody shooting at you - for a reason. Are you a gangster? Do I look like one? - I don't think so. So, ain't no gangster. Gangsters are unhappy people, doing time in jail, tattoos, cirrhosis. God forbid. So, where did you split? - Do you really need to know, man? Just in case my head's gonna be torn off. It's simple. What man needs is money and power. A strong man needs even more money and power. And a young and strong one? Most of all - that's why we're cutting our throats! Are you not tired running cross-country? - Nothing else left. I was born to live like this. Just have a look at me, man. Do you really think I should be a workhorse in the factory? God gave me the teeth - so I live like a predator. We are in a sing-a-song mood now, 'cause we are eased off a bit. But in case of danger, don't take it amiss. Are you not afraid of God? - Does he exist? Of course, he does. - In the icons? Hand-made by people. Pain exists, death exists too, but I've never seen God. The sheep invented God, to ashame the wolves so that they bite less. Layda, Layda, my girl, you're back! Come, come to me, my dear. Scared. I left you alone, forgive me, forgive me. Layda, my sweet girl. Back again! You clever dog! Quiet. Hush. - Make her shut up. Quiet... - I said shut her up. Follow me, quickly. Come, come to me, quiet, down. Shut her up. Quiet, quiet. What's up there, Ivan? Are you alive over there, Ivan? Quiet, quiet. Kill him! You'll die yourself. You all will die, bastards. He's over there! Give me the knife. - Why? Knife! - What for? - Give me I say. What are you after? I want to kill the dog. No way. Look. Think yourself, if she barks again, we are dead. She'll be quiet. You've made a deal with her? Don't be a fool. No-no, she is really very calm. I swear. No use of her when hunting. I take her just for fun. But normally she's lazy, a bad bird flusher, quiet all the way. Oh yes, I heard her being quiet. - No! No way, it's impossible, I took her when she was a puppy. When she was sick, I carried her in my arms, cherished her like a baby. Give me the knife! - Never! Don't you touch her! No! Listen, idiot. It's only an animal, it has no wits. But you are supposed to. Do you want to live or not? But she is live, too. You hear me, live! I'll shoot her anyway, nothing to lose. At least, there's nobody around here. Don't do that, please. What, Ivan, are you fucking bad? Alright, just be patient, that's a scratch. Oleg, you told us it would be a two-minute ride, yeah? Don't shout at me. But you don't shut my mouth. Who's got us down here? Do I need him alone? Aren't you in big trouble, are you? I have a hole in my belly. You still can walk. Cut it, calm down. Fuck, he's about to die, we must take him to hospital urgently, Oleg. You hear me, Oleg! - No. What? I missed it. Nobody goes nowhere. We leave when it's over. You fucker, never decide for me. You want to have a walk? - Oleg, cut it, he's in trouble. I can see myself. Crazy. Where shall we chase them? And he may die. May we bite the dust for a team? - Don't talk crap. If we leave, they get away for sure. You idiot, just think who gets away? He's about to die, can't you see. - If we let them go, everybody dies. Kill her... But it is Ivan, our Ivan! - Cool down. Strangle her! Good. Don't shout. It'll take us three hours for a round trip. We'll be back late in the night then. They'll be in town by then, am I wrong? Am I wrong? OK, let's go. Alright, we go then. I'm a crum. Life can force you even to kill a man. We've been friends since childhood. All four of us. Like real brothers. We've been in such wars together, horrible to remember. But it's true when you're young, ready to go into fire for a friend. And later when the life was nice... we all had wives and kids... Nobody wanted to die any more. They ask me to join for the sauna. I suspect nothing, I say let's go! And they drive me here in the forest... ...kneel me... ...put the gun against my head. Sorry, brother, you've been spotted. You gonna bring us along down. We are all crums, when it goes to living or dying. Seems our luck, let's go. Hey, man, will you give us a lift back to town? No, I'm here to remain overnight. You'll drive us and come back again, not a big deal. Are you crazy? Aha, make me. It's urgent, old boy! It's really a case. Whatever case - I don't care. I tell you, no lift. I've just come myself. Listen, it's about life and death. I can see it clearly. Hardly alive! You're simply gonna die, with your morning head! They can kill us! - Who? Some local thugs, bandits, we've hardly escaped. By the way, you seem to be unsafe here, too! Are you pulling my leg? Just look at us, fool, we're all beaten black-and-blue. I can see, really you are. Certainly. Got sloshed, then fought. Then lost your way, now you want back home. Walk till you see the motor road, pick up somebody, it's no tundra here. OK, man, thanks. Welcome. Now, I'm gonna cross the river. You swim? - No, I'll get by air! Why should you? You'll see, fool. When I'm swimming, you hold him under the gun. If he moves, shoot out. Where? - Doesn't matter, he must not get away. When I'm over there, I'll take the keys and we go back home. Ready? I can't shoot out at a man. - If you wanna live, you will. Charged. Let's go. Here! Good boy. Rinse your brains. But you better swim elsewhere, or you scare away all my fish. Hey, fucker! I'm on a visit to you. Prepare the car keys for me. Ha, make me! - Of course, I will. Right now. And if you run, you'll get a shot in your ass. Or elsewhere at random. Keep him under the gun. Are you crazy, fellows? My ass! Hold it! Hey! Stop! Don't make me shoot, hold it! Fuck you, goons! Stay where you are, I say. I will shoot! Kill him! - But I can't! So what, shall I destroy you, slut? Stay where you are! So what? Will you kill me? But you can't, I'm a human being. You are not! The old one... Hey, you. What do you need? Any transport? Nope. And a shotgun? I've got the booze. Where is the town, you know? I do. Where? There. Where - there? There, where? OK, I got it. Listen, oldie... Has anybody come to you by chance? Ask him. Don't move. Sergei! - Oleg, he's over here, do not enter. I'll beat his brains out, if you enter. You start up the engine, and leave the keys in the ignition. Put the gun down. No way about the gun. Don't even ask. OK, then crank it up. Oleg, don't give a fucking thing to him! - Will you shut up. If he refuses, you'll die, my word. I can't hear the engine! - Don't let him go, Oleg! Shoot out! Are you nuts, fool? You will die now! Alright, I was fooling. Come out. If you play a fool once more, I'll release the whole clip in his mouth. Oleg, don't let him go! If he kills you, I won't do it alone. What about Ivan then, all in vain? We must not die right now, we'll see afterwards. Come out! That's it, we go! Out of the car. This one will come with me. Why do you need him? The town is right behind the forest. I say he'll be with me. Get back in the car. Freeze! Let him go, or I'll pull the trigger. Do you need the car or him? What are you doing, people? Listen, you old fool! Go, keep drinking, we can clear it without you. You just look around. Everything's ruined, shitified, devastated. Nobody cares about nothing, everybody's scooping for himself. You kill each other for papers, step on others' lives, walk on blood. Does your soul ache? It smells musty all around. Rotten... And you... Brother against brother... Go, father. Too late to pray for us. Devils, we are devils not humans. You brat... Alright, we split now. As I go away a hundred meters, we'll release them both. Deal. Is he really worth it? See that you don't go wrong. I won't let you get away alive, my word. Step back. What are you doing, fool? You were free to drive away. Where is the clip? In the belt. You fool... Thanks. I didn't expect it. - Andrey. Oleg, don't take risks, they'll come out on their own. We need a shelter. A good one. Can you find it? I can. - Where? Over there, at the end of the street. Alright. When I say "run", you run! If I shout "stop", you hide out. Got it? You got it? Ready? Ready? Ready? Yes. Run! Sergei, the man is running. Shoot at him. He almost did it! Kill him down. Run! On the ground! Stop! Sergei, he's covering him! They work as a team. Watch him out, he can get you! Run! Stop, get down! Hold it! Sergei, stop here. Run! Slow it down, Oleg! I am missing. - But they're about to escape. Slow down, I say, it's too shaky. - They're flinging off. Fuckers. Drive detour. We can shortcut them. To the wall. Don't raise your head. Sergei! Where? Stay here! You got me, slut. Don't do it, Sergei. Cool down, we must think. OK, clever boots. Where are you going? No worry, I won't escape. Andrey! Andrey! Are you alright? Andrey? Are you hurt? Andrey? Get up. Take care of Tanya and the girls. OK. Who's the first? What? Oh no. You assholes. Where do I come in? It's your business, scumbags. But I have my kids at home. My wife is frying potato. We go to my wife's mother tomorrow to help with the roof repair. I'm gonna be awarded the sixth grade next week. I want to live, do you hear? Freaks. Live! Live! Live! So you wanna live? Sergei. Alive? My shoulder... Bring the shotgun. Give him a shell. If you kill him... ...I will let you go. English fansubs by SKV+
