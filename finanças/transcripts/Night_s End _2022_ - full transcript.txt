I could research it for you, even. - No, thank you. - You get creeped out too easily. Always have. - No, I don't. - Mm-hmm. Except for your creepy birds. Hey, my birds are not creepy. They are comforting. Did the building owner say anything when you moved in? About people dying in my apartment? No. Yeah, don't they have to reveal stuff like that to you when you rent it? The building was built in, like, 1905. Mm, so maybe somebody croaked there like 100 years ago and the building owner doesn't even know about it. Are there any weird bloodstains on the floor? Or, like, tapping noises in the walls? or terrifying, blood-curdling screams in the hallway? [Chuckles] Yeah, well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but the only weird screams are mine. - The kids are at Donna's? - Mm-hmm. Hanging out with her girls. Yeah.

Hey, maybe give the girls a call Saturday morning? - Yeah, for sure. - All right. Take care, okay? Alright, bye. [Computer chimes] It's time for the "Dark Corners" clip of the week. Ghost blogger Catherine Ohau sent us this clip from her channel, "Haunted Ohau," where she investigates haunted and abandoned buildings. In this particular investigation, Catherine was searching the long-empty St. Ambrose School in Winston, New York, and as she moved down the first-floor hallway, she noticed a few bits of discarded clothes on the floor and a number of overturned desks. With her camera, though, she caught something truly terrifying. Did you catch it? Uh, I have your book, "Ghost and Their Personas." Wonderful. So, do you have your spirit jar handy? Uh, yeah, it's right here. Can you hold it up so that I can see it? Mm-hmm. Move it a little closer. Spin it around. Okay. Yes. Thank you. Can you tell me what offerings you've included with your spirit jar? Any coins or herbs? Maybe some hair? I-I was supposed to put hair in I? Or coins or herbs. No, I didn't put anything in it. Oh, I see. All right. Uh, and then the symbols that are written on the spirit jar... where did they come from? Uh, from a list that a viewer sent me. And then the rest of the symbols... those are from my book? Yeah. From your book, yeah. Well, based on examining your spirit jar and now hearing that you hadn't included any offerings, along with a mish-mash of symbols, I'm inclined to believe that your jar is empty. And since it's empty, you may now open the jar. Are you frightened to open the jar? Yeah, if... if I'm being honest, I am. Well, if it helps, I'll say once more, there is currently nothing trapped inside your homemade spirit jar. If there is, what should I be prepared for? Nothing, Ken. Ghosts... they're like smoke. They can't do anything to you. They have no true physical form, no real power. Ghosts are like a thin veil drawn across our reality. Right. So even if there were a ghost in your jar, which there isn't, it couldn't do a damn thing to you. Open the jar. Okay. Empty? Yeah. Was there anything else you needed? Uh, no, I guess not.

Who told you she was the one to tell me to do research? You did. No, I didn't. I think you did. I would really appreciate it if the two of you did not conspire against me. We're not. Did you tell her I was drinking? Hell no. Do you have a problem with me drinking, Terry? I guess I'm just worried about your state of mind, man. I'm not a drunk! But nearly two years ago, you didhave a nervous breakdown which led to you drinking way too much, which led to you losing both your job and your family, right? What's happening right now with me in this apartment has nothing to do with that. Okay, and why did you have to move so far away from your kids anyhow... and from me, for that matter? What are you trying to escape... reality? I needed a fresh start. This shit is your fresh start. You know what, if you think I'm such a fuck-up, just say so. I don't think you're a fuck-up. You're bad friend, Terry. You're a fucking enabler. If I'm an enabler, then you're fucking indulger. If I'm an indulger, why would I make up a fake haunting just to ruin a life that I don't want? You know what? You wanted to do this ghost-video stuff so you could make money so you wouldn't have to go get a real job out in the real world. Terry... you've known me since grade school. Everything that is going on with me is not like before. It's really happening. None of it is fake. Fine. - You believe me? - Never said I didn't. And hey, I didn't tell Kelsey about us having a few beers, and I don't care if you want to hide from the world. Maybe we should all be hiding. You good? Yeah. Maybe. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ I suppose what I'm saying is, the last time we spoke, when I examined your spirit jar and said that it was empty? Wait, it's not? No, the jar was empty, but I took the liberty of doing some research on your Roberta Wellwood, which in turn led me to some medical reports that date back to about five years after the young woman's tragic fall. These reports that I found involve Roberta's mother, Yvonne Wellwood, whereas she confessed that, in a fit of rage, she pushed Roberta out the window after the failed axe attack on the father. Holy shit. Holy shit, indeed. These reports go on to reveal that, not soon after Yvonne's confession of murder, she committed suicide. She committed suicide in this apartment? No, not there, but in a psychiatric facility where she was being kept. Now, my theory is that when you attempted to use your homemade spirit jar, you inadvertently harvested her deranged soul. Whoa, whoa. I harvested her soul? Yes. And it took a while for Yvonne Wellwood to reincorporate from the astral plane back into your apartment. So that's why she didn't immediately present herself. But once she did, Yvonne began to wreak havoc in the hopes of capturing Roberta's spirit so that she could replay her daughter's murder again and again. Why would... Why would she do that? It's called a ghost loop. It happens when restless spirits are fated to repeat their tragic circumstances. Okay. Okay. Um, you said you had good news? The good news is, I think I may have a way I can help you. I'm going to priority mail you my very own personal spirit jar, complete with the correct markings, which should, A, capture and hold the demented spirit of Yvonne Wellwood and, B, release the confined spirit of poor Roberta Wellwood so that she may then enter the light. Your spirit jar could do all of that? Yes, it could. Yes. You do want to help Roberta, yes? Of course, yes. But first, before I set our plan in motion, I'm wondering if you could show me the ribbon you e-mailed me about. I'd like to examine it. Okay, okay, I'll get it. Hold on. With these gifts, mark this place. With this root, I stain this flame. In this room, with threefold law, and with these seeds, begin to draw. With these words, the tree now bends. Ad ligundum eos perito, eos corum nostrus vende. ♪♪ ♪♪ Okay, I got it. Hey. Uh, what was that noise? I accidentally stepped on my cat. Is your cat okay? Probably. Is that the ribbon? Oh, yeah, this is it. Ah. Very interesting. Thank you. So, Ken, do nothing until you receive my spirit jar in the mail. Don't contact any spirits or record anything. Understand? I won't, I promise. Do know that I believe you, in regards to all that you've shared. And listen, Ken. I know we don't know each other well, but I do know that you live alone, as do I. So I, too, understand the strain that life gives us, especially when things seem out of our control. But if I could, I'd like to give you some advice. Put your world in order. Forget all the problems that are outside of yourself until everything is less, well, diagonal. Once you've tackled your assumed uncertainness, your self-loathing, your inability to move forward, then and only then can you begin to manage your external issues. Understand? I-I think so. I'm saying, help yourself, then help Roberta, then help everyone else. - [Exhales] - I promise we'll fix this, Ken. - Together. - Oh, yes. [Computer chimes] [Exhales] But anyway, more about your amazing news. Yeah. Right. When's it happening? I just got the e-mail this morning. - When'd you send the clip in? - That's just it. I didn't.

The history of Ken's building coupled with the need to save the soul of a young woman who died a tragic death. Ken's willingness to participate in this cleansing ritual is sincerely a heroic act. It's very dangerous, this kind of ritual. So there's bound to be a few supernatural fireworks in the room tonight. Fasten your seatbelts, fuckers. Welcome to tonight's amazing "Dark Corners" live-stream investigation of the bizarre and terrifying Wellwood ghosts. Before we head to our investigation, though, I want to take a minute to reintroduce our expert panel. First from "Thriller Vids," paranormal expert and popular ghost blogger Lyden Knight. It's great to be here, D.C. And also, best-selling author and award-winning paranormal researcher Colin Albertson. And of course, there's me, your host, Dark Corners. Colin, you were the person who originally turned me on to Ken's videos of the Wellwood ghosts. What made you want to send me his link? I actually discovered Ken's posts rather by accident. He referenced my book in one of his first videos. I contacted Ken, offering to help him better investigate his haunting. We should note, you've been out of the paranormal-research loop for a while now, right? I admit I've had my share of recent legal kerfuffles, but I've put all that aside. Tonight's event is far too important. Now, Lyden, you've examined the videos of Ken Barber's purported Wellwood ghosts. - Thoroughly. - What's your take? In Ken's first encounter with the spirit that he refers to as Roberta, she appears to be wearing a white dress. I've heard some people say they also think she appears to be screaming. The reason Roberta most likely is screaming is... Right, Colin, you said you've done some additional research on the building. I discovered that Roberta's mother, Yvonne Wellwood... The second Wellwood ghost, whom we are hoping we encounter tonight. Yes. That Yvonne had actually confessed to murdering Roberta. Yes. Additionally, there is reason to believe that that haunting will continue. Colin's theory is... and correct me, Colin, if I'm wrong. Colin's theory is that Ken's homemade spirit jar might have somehow pulled the spirit of Roberta's mother from the astral plane to our earthly plane to torment her daughter again and again. Let me remind everyone what we're referring to. And let me warn you, this video is truly terrifying. [Footsteps approaching] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No. Did you catch it? No, no, no, no, no... There. But what is it? I have to say, that thing doesn't look like it could be the ghost of Yvonne Wellwood. When the spirit of Yvonne Wellwood entered our earthly plane, she underwent a radical ectoplasmic transformation. Whatever it is, it looks dangerous. Well, Yvonne was a psychotic murderer. According to whatever medical files you found? Exactly. Well, I did a little research into Yvonne Wellwood myself, and I found no record of her at all. That's strange. Either way, it seems there's no denying there are likely two paranormal entities haunting this location, which should make for an intriguing investigation. And so, with that, how about we head on over to Ken Barber, currently at the Wellwood investigation site? Ken Barber. Oh, h-hey, D.C. I have to say, we are so amped to be delving into your haunting. Tell me, is there anything happening there right now? Uh, no, nothing. But i-if something does happen, I will make sure to let you know. Along with tonight's "Dark Corners" live stream, we've got something special planned for our investigation. Ken, would you like to elaborate? Uh, sure. Colin sent me this. That's Colin's personal spirit jar, correct? It is. Is it safe to use? Of course. Perfectly. I just hope it works. It will cleanse the space. Promise. We're hoping we might actually exorcise both Wellwood ghosts from your apartment. Is that right, Ken? It is. Let me introduce, live, in-person, our special guests, Terry Gilson and Kelsey and Isaac Dees. Hey, what's up? - Oh, hello. - Hey, D.C. So jazzed to be here. It is so cool to have everyone here. Okay. Okay, if you're just joining us, we're hoping to use an authentic paranormal device called a spirit jar to call forth and actually release the purported spirit of the young Roberta Wellwood to the astral plane and capture and contain her murderous mother, Yvonne Wellwood. Is that right, Colin? - Yes, D.C. - Okay. Ken, hey. Are you nearly ready? Uh, yeah, I think we're good to go. It looks like we've officially begun our live stream. Take it away, Colin, whenever you're ready. Ken, along with my spirit jar, I've included a velvet bag. Yeah, sorry to interrupt, Colin, but could you explain the symbols on the jar? [Sighs] The symbols are an ancient language. Each symbol... By "ancient," how old do you mean? They are quite... old. And what specific language are the symbols derived from? I'm sorry, D.C., and I apologize, but now that I have begun the ritual, I'd ask to not have any interruptions. Oh, right. Sorry. Apologies. Thank you. Ken, go ahead and open the jar. Good. I sent along a few items in a velvet bag. Uh, right. Now, call out each individual item as you remove it from the bag. A, uh... A purple rock. Good. - The next item, please. - A raven's claw. Good. A piece of broken mirror. Excellent. - And finally. - Um... It's, uh... My thumb. - No fucking way. - Go ahead. Put my thumb in the spirit jar, Ken. - Oh. - Oh, hell no. Oh, hell no! Good. Now, Ken, You should have also received an envelope. Go ahead and open that envelope and remove its contents. Ye... Yeah. Yeah. Now, in order for the cleansing to work, I'll need you to light the candle, then both of us will say the first half of the incantation. - We should read it together? - Yes, together. Well, go ahead, light the candle. [Strikes match] Etsa talakel. Etsa talakel. Tes zel samante. Tes zel samante. Telana une runa. Cons noma tel telana une runa.

Footsteps or... or breathing, or any other sounds? No. D.C., I would like to continue the ritual, if I may. Uh, yeah, sorry. Thank you, Colin. Ken, if you could pick up the spirit jar and put it in your left hand. We'll now read the second half of the incantation so we may release Roberta from her earthly binds. Are you ready? Yeah, le... let's just get this over with. Come, etsa talakel. Come, etsa talakel. You who wish entry. [Both] You who wish pain. You who wish fire. You who wish flame.

I'm assuming that to be the second Wellwood ghost, the ghost of Yvonne Wellwood? - Right, Colin? - Colin? Okay, any... any advice on what Ken should do right now? Um, Colin? D.C., I really don't think that thing is the ghost of Yvonne Wellwood. Colin! I now welcome to this mortal existence, the fully realized and corporeal form of the most corrupt and holy Etsa Talakel! What the fuck is he doing?! The one and true lord of the malicious flame! [Laughs maniacally] [Woman screams] Oh, shit. What the hell is happening? Stop playing. Ken! Is that it?
