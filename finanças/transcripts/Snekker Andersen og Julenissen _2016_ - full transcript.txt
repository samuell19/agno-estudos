This is the story of a boy named Andersen. He probably had also a first name, but everyone just called him Andersen. Every Christmas he almost burst out of curiosity. "Santa Claus is coming This year too?" But on a Christmas Andersen was around six, something terrible happened. Andersen had so much to do that he forgot his wish list to put in the Christmas stocking. Where should Santa Claus come from? Now know what he should bring him? That Christmas Eve Andersen was very unhappy. But Santa came. "Are there good children here?", he asked, looking at Andersen. But Andersen didn't say a word. He never knew this little one would get blue ski jumper which he is more than wish everything else in the world. But do you know what? As Andersen unwrapped his gift... Exactly. It was a ski jumper! Exactly the one that he wanted. Little Andersen was so happy that he didn't even know on which foot it should stand. And after that day there was no one to whom Santa loved as much as Andersen. But today's story wears many years later at Christmas too. From little Andersen had become the great carpenter Andersen. And he had a woman. And three children. The day before Christmas Eve Andersen was on the roof and decorated the house. But he had no idea this is the strangest Christmas that he had ever experienced. What are you doing dad Come here. Great right? What are you guys doing because up here? I decorate. Decorate? Watch out. I decorate for Santa Claus. Isn't that nice? - It looks really great, dad. Do you have a Written wish list? No. - But you should do that. It's your turn. Wheat flour Wish list car racing track Karl. You are six years old. You always have not yet understood? You know, do not you, who is santa claus? Mummy! Mummy! Sverre and Tone? Sverre and Tone? Go out there and check it out. The house looks so nice. Look at that. I thought I had the flap closed. So. I will close your mouth! Listen carefully... Mummy! - Not now, Karl, be quiet! Dad, there is a fire! My goodness! How could I forgot the cookies? Well, well... - Open the window! Look at this. No no no! All elves are broken. I'm sorry. Silly me, to use my flour without looking for elves beforehand! That's a shame. - Oh, do you think? These were calendar presents. - I don't have time for that! I still have to salt the ribs. For tomorrow. Where did you put it The rib. Just say you forgot to buy the ribs! I knew there was something. It wasn't easy to find the outside lights. I had to be in six, seven stores go and when I finally did had found the right ones I'm home very quickly to finish decorating. Therefore... I have the rib just forget. You idiot! Did you forget your family to visit tomorrow? - No. What will your mother say if she doesn't get pork ribs? "The most important thing is that the family together at Christmas." Family... Carpenter Andersen! - Yes. Tomorrow morning you will be the first go to the butcher immediately. And buy ribs. - Yes. And pray to God that they are not sold out. Otherwise I leave Christmas fail this year! You can Christmas don't drop out. And now you're cleaning the living room! - Yes. Calendar gifts... Don't get dirty. - Don't we celebrate Christmas, dad? What are you saying - Are we not celebrating Christmas? But. Of course we will Celebrate Christmas. Mom sounds a little annoyed. Yes. And the... Its my fault. But I will clean. And afterwards everything will shine here and be even cleaner than before. I'll tell you a secret. Nobody can scrub floors so well like we men. But don't tell the women. Otherwise they make sure that you have to keep cleaning. Karl! What is it? - Come here! Do you see her? Look at the little footsteps! Was it a Christmas gnome? - What are you doing? A gnome was there and ate our porridge. That was probably dad. Do you think your father eats the porridge from the gnome? Yes, I think. Little Miss, I have to ask very much. Look at that. I don't have feet that small. - That was an elf. How stupid are you holding us, dad? Don't listen to them You are just confused of all the pop music. You and I know better. A Christmas gnome was clearly here. Come on. Just imagine the children find on Christmas Eve no gift on her calendar. Now listen... Can we do that with Santa Claus? Screw down this year? You know, do not you, what happened last year. I have Santa Claus not seen. I have been to the restrooms. Firefighters exempt Santa Claus from the fireplace Oh yes, that. Do you remember That was the most embarrassing what ever happened to me I can only imagine, what our neighbors think. Yes. Santa Claus had some bad luck, I admit it. But now I've swept the fireplace. Santa Claus is there slip through like an oiled bolt of lightning. No. Good. So we agree? Yes. The deal is that this year doesn't slip through the fireplace? Yes / Yes. I will tell him. Very well. Good night. Good night. What in the world are you doing up there?! Hey I'm not doing anything. I'm just hanging here. Finally caught. We got him. - Dad is Santa Claus. No no no. I have a sound heard in the living room. So I came in here to see if everything is OK. Look! There are sweets in your stockings. So Santa Claus was there. Cut off your father right away! Who promised me that he had none Santa Claus nonsense does more? I just promised that Santa Claus will not climb on the roof. Look at this! This is total chaos! - Yes. Your Santa Claus madness ruined our Christmas! Yes. - Yes. I screwed it up. I request that Santa Claus takes time off this year. In his own interest. And with it the rest of us gets some peace and quiet. Okay. Except on Christmas Eve. - No exception! That is my decision. What if he just knocks on the window? - No. Coming on a bike? Or maybe... - No, stop now. No! Good. - No. Your Santa Claus won't do anything. He won't come through the fireplace. Or through the door. Not on water and especially not through the air. Santa Claus is not coming this year! But he has to... - No! No. - And it stays that way! Great. Well... My wife is probably right. There is time for everything Carpenter Andersen. Father? Tell me. Are you still awake? - I can not sleep. Should I read you a story? - No. Karl, what's up? Is it true that Santa Claus won't come? Santa Claus? Well it may be that he Christmas Eve is too busy. Like you and me. I told you how I once should build a kitchen for people me until Christmas not finished? And they came to eat with us. Yes, I already know the story. Okay. If that is the case, that Santa Claus doesn't have time to visit us... I'll get it then no christmas present? But! Of course you get a Christmas present. And how do I get the gift? Then... Then we will Call Santa Claus. Yes Yes Yes. Then he will call us and tell us where he hid the presents. Then we can pick them up. But, dad, it is not the same. You have to do that do not worry about it. Everything will be fine. Promised. But now you have to sleep my boy. Otherwise we wait forever on Christmas Eve. Good night. Good night. Sleep well. No, the talking wasn't necessarily Andersen's greatest strength. What should he do now? What! Is there any post today? Yes, always on duty. And you have December 24th Time to drive around? No, I had to do a few errands. Errands. You mean the rib there. Yes. And, Andersen, what is your fireplace doing Can Santa Claus come back? A little Christmas decoration doesn't hurt. - Yes / Yes. So... Aunt Ågot from Hamar. You won't get rid of them, will you? Looks like you forgot to invite them to Christmas dinner. Call her. I have Christmas vacation now. Yes. - Yes. And you should scatter your way. I barely made it up here. I'm sorry. And Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. Let's see. Hello Hello hello! Hi. Are you good here... Are there good children here? Carpenter Andersen? Karl will like the card. "For Karl." Carpenter Andersen? Where are you? What are you doing now I chop wood. In your underwear? I want my pants don't get dirty. Listen, I need the rib. - Is in the front seat. I bought the best that the butcher had to offer. Hi. "I want my pants don't get dirty." They are coming! - Anyone home? Hello my little one! - How nice to see you! Merry Christmas! Hi. Merry Christmas to you too. Welcome! - Merry Christmas, my son! Would you take that off me I hope you are all hungry. There is someone really put effort. Ribs and sausages, Sauerkraut and red cabbage. Yes, everything you need for a successful Christmas needs. But one ate his plate empty much faster than the others. Don't you think should you stop slowly? Tomorrow is also a day. - Yes Yes Yes. Can we get up? - Yes. So... that's the best rib, I've ever eaten. But your cooking skills I can’t get it. Well... The most important thing is that the family together at Christmas. Well, Karl... Hey What are you doing here all by yourself? - I'm just standing around a bit. You know, now there is rice pudding, with almond. And something tells me that you this year get the almond. Do you think? Come along. Without the soft snow and a little bit of luck our story would end here. Hi! Maybe it starts but only at this point. Are you doing well? You look like you have beaten you. Everything OK? Yes, thank you. Everything seems to be still there. Good. We seem to be on the same mission to be on the go. The Santa Claus suit and all that. Yes. Carpenter Andersen. Santa Claus. Yes... A nice little joke. After all, it is Christmas Eve. Yes Yes Yes. Exactly. Yes / Yes. What happened? Oh no! This is the gift for my son. But now everything is broken. Oh dear! Do you live in the house up there Yes. So you're a carpenter Andersen? Yes Yes Yes. Yes. It is my children never in her entire life have seen a real carpenter. I always tell them if you are very dear, then joiner Andersen comes maybe visit them. But we have each other never met so... How about a business? I visit your children and you visit mine. Then none of them have to be alone on Christmas Eve. Could you do that? - Yes. I do that anyway. Thank you so much! Thanks alot! Yes Yes Yes. It's a pleasure. Since they don't know me that would have to work out. No no no. Take off that silly suit. And who do I dress up as? You don't have to dress up. My kids see Santa Claus anyway every day. Just follow my footsteps. Go in there and keep going. And if you have a big rock you reach a stump and a fir, then you're there. In there and keep going, and... All right. Carpenter Andersen didn't know how it happened. So he decided "go in there and keep going". Just like the man in the Santa Claus costume had said. Hi? Is someone there? No! What's this? One two, three Christmas hats? Are you the carpenter Of course it is. Just see how big it is. Are you a real carpenter Yes, I am a carpenter. Hooray, the carpenter! I touched him first! Where are you taking me? You come with us. Come over! Come on! More quickly! Go inside Take care of your head! Come over! Don't strike, carpenter Andersen. What is this place? - Our home. Here we live. Mummy! The carpenter is here! Don't scream, kids. - But that's the carpenter! I can not believe it! - Isn't he great, mom? I found him! - Calm down, children. You pretend you have never seen a human being. Is he human? - Look how big he is, mom! Yes, so... - You never saw him first. You... Come on in! Andersen. Oh you... I can't believe I have never seen your house before. Well, it's hidden too. Most people just walk by. You decorate your house because not for Christmas? We don't have time for that. But you celebrate Christmas. No. My husband is Christmas but never at home. Don't you get gifts? So your husband is handing out presents to strangers, but your own children don't get any? No. That’s not possible. I'll carve some. Yes! Is there some wood somewhere? We have roots. I get it! - Me too! I already know what I want! Isn't that too cumbersome? - No no no. Oh, is there a strange elf? That is Andersen. The Carpenter. I've seen you before Do you carve a sled for me? - And a doll bed for me? A doll bed! This is my biggest wish! I asked first. - I want a doll bed! One after the other. Carriage. Doll bed. And what do you want? I do not know. Yes, he knows well. - Yes, he knew earlier. Tell me. - A spinning top. A spinning top? Then you should get one too. And Andersen started with what he did best. But waited at his home a very disappointed little boy. Hi? Are there good children here? Look, there is a little guy! Santa is here! Santa Claus has come! You see, I said Santa Claus is coming! Good evening and Merry Christmas. If that's not Santa Claus... - Merry Christmas! The real one. Sit down by the fireplace. - Thanks a lot. Yes... This will be carpenter Andersen still sorry! Have you been good - Very! Yes! We were really good. Yes! That's nice. Santa Claus? You're sure to be hungry. Oh. Do you hear the? My stomach is growling, something to eat would be really great. I'm not saying no. Please, Santa Claus. - Oh yes, look! Ui, ui, ui! - Yes... Then enjoy your meal. Yes, yes, look! Ui, ui, ui! It looks really good. My goodness! I can never get enough of porridge. Yes? Don't you think it's too spicy? It tastes fantastic. It's wonderful. Wait, can I try it? Forgiveness. No, this time it was not so easy To expose carpenter Andersen. He was busy at the same time Carve Christmas presents. The boy got a sled and the girl a doll bed. Exactly, what they wanted. This one... Is for you. Thank you. Do you have a doll - I have a baby forest mouse. A baby forest mouse? Yes, it's like that play with a doll. Come here. Look at this. Hi. A really cute wood mouse. Do you want your top? Not try it? May I? It's really great! Do you have a wish? I? No... What would you like, grandpa? Grandpa doesn't listen so well anymore. Let's see... This here! What are you carving there, Andersen? Yes / Yes. Then let's see what's in here. I bet you know everything. Everything? I? No, I wouldn't say that. I mean about Santa Claus. - I see. I know a lot about that, yes. OK. Is this kind of a quiz now? Well then... What is the name of Santa Claus in Sweden? Santa Claus in Sweden? I think it means... "Jultomten"? Not? - Correct.

It's so hot there. But you also dance there. And they call Santa Claus... "Kanakaloka, Kanakaloka ..." I'm sorry. So rarely does anyone ask me after my work. Most people just want their packages. That is fun. Have you got any more questions? Uh, yes. - Yes? How do you do it, all of them Deliver gifts in one day? Good question. Which I look at every year for Christmas. I do not know it either. I'm taking one house at a time. And it always goes well. Well, of course I have a lot of experience and know some abbreviations. So i have answered all your questions? Yes. Now i have all the answers to my questions. Very well. Here is a little boy who is excited? We can do something about that. Fire! What the hell drove in you?! How do you behave? - He burned. Don't worry, I'm fine. For Christmas you quickly catch fire. But now you're completely wet. I'll get you a towel. Here is something for you... Is this okay, when I'm sitting here? This Christmas eve I'll never forget No... You are welcome. This is for you. Where have you ever seen me No! Do you hear something, grandpa - What did you hear, grandpa? I can hear you all!

You wanted to go outside right away to play with him. It's true. Come along. I want to show you something. You have us forever no longer understood, grandpa. Yes. I can not believe it! What is this? Here we keep for the children the Christmas presents on. Santa and me run the shop together. And where's the workshop from Santa Claus? That's not how it works. But who then poses all these presents from? They are empty. - Yes. Otherwise Santa could don't carry as many packets. No, these are... Wish parcel. Wish parcel? Yes. Wish parcel. Santa Claus can't know what your children would like before he sees her. My children write wish list. O yes. But there are so many children out there. We would drown in paper if you would send everything here. That's no joke. Do you understand, wish package work as follows: When children get their parcel, then they have to wish for what you would like. This is how dream packages work. Maybe you have too a wish for Christmas? Yes. I could have one. Take this here. But don't forget to wish you something before you open it Wish me something. Let's see... That is for Karl. - You are that. Is there someone here with that name? Karl? What do you wish for An au - No no no! Not say. You have to think about it. Wish you. Yes! Mom, look! Look! Ui, ui, ui!

And how was it? - Oh hello! What did my kids say? - You were very happy. And now they're waiting that you will come home soon Yes... And how was it for you? Was Karl afraid? Not at all.

Exactly where he has ever been had fallen that evening. Oh no! No no no! No no... Then carpenter Andersen became suddenly everything is clear. He had been lying in the snow and all just dreamed What should he do now? Tell his family? Imagine! Santa called. His sleigh had... a flat tire. He is waiting for the towing service. But he will still come. Before the new year. So... There you are! Father! Look! Santa Claus was there and I have one Get racetrack! Santa was here? Yes, you missed it again. Let's swap the cars. Here, I'll show you how it's done. Did you get gifts too? Yes, I have one Get turntables. But you already know all that. Have a look. Let's see... That's how it's done. Do you want cake? Sweetheart? Hey Are you all right? Yes. Now listen... Thank you for the gift. She is beautiful. That's exactly what I wanted. I just have to go to the toilet. Father? Yes? - Do you know what I saw? No. No. I don't know for sure. I saw like mom kissed Santa Claus. Mom kissed him? Certainly? Yes, honestly, great word of honor. Well, it's Christmas and there mom can Santa Claus give a little kiss. You are never here, when Santa Claus comes. Are you keeping a secret? - Yes. That's good because that... It is a very big secret. You know, where I've been tonight No. I was with Santa's children and made gifts for her. In Santa's house! Really? - Yes, it is true. Just as true like I'm kneeling in front of you Did you like the presents? Yes, I think they were very happy. Just like you. This is the best Christmas at all. The best? Yes, I think so too.
