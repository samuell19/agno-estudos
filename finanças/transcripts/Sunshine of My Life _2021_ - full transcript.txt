Ah! Hey! Good girl. So naughty. All right. Ma... ma. Honey, did you hear that? Our baby said "mama". Of course not, you heard wrong. What do you mean? She should've said baba. Don't forget, I hold her every night until she falls asleep. Of course not. Listen to this. Have a listen? Ma... ma. Ma... ma. I don't have a care in the world Living carefree Three meals a day is all I need Totally free from worries Come around, and have a look. Good commodity at cheap price. Baby. Don't go too far or I can't hear you. Are you hungry? Baby? What happened? What's going on? Baby! Baby, are you scalded? Baby! Keung, I don't want to nag you. Didn't I advise you right from the beginning not to have baby? It's fine with getting married and having a companion. But it's difficult to raise a kid, even with a normal vision. Now look at you two. Yan is still small, send her to the Social Welfare Department. You won't always be so lucky to be able to save the baby. I'm sorry, Yan Yan. You got hurt because I didn't take good care of you. Wow! There's a big bird in the sky. Silly girl. It's a little birdy, right? Yan Yan, what else do you see? I also see a lot of clouds, and one of them looks like a big whale with a big castle on its back. There are lots of fish swimming around it, and there's seaweed floating underneath. Isn't that beautiful? Yes, it is. - How many cheers are there? - I got it... - How many cries of sorrow are there? - Full house. How can I... - Your turn. - Hey. Can you lower your voice? I can't hear the lyrics. - I'm done with the drawing. - I lose track. Really? What did you draw today? What is it? This is mommy in a superwoman suit. This is daddy in a space suit. I'm in the middle, with hearts on my shirt. We're sitting on a flying banana boat. These are one-eyed stars. Here... and there... Isn't that beautiful? You keep saying "here" and "there", but we can't see it. But honey, you have a beautiful voice. Lunch menu... sausage, ham, red sausage, fried egg, scrambled eggs, sunny-side up, pork with pickled vegetables, twice-cooked pork, spiced pork cubes, satay beef, choose two of the above. Along with macaroni, rice noodles, or instant noodles for 24 dollars. What types of eggs did you say there were? Fried egg, scrambled eggs, sunny-side up. Little girl, you're getting smarter by the day. Keung, I've really found you something good this time. The Chinese medicine doctor couldn't help before, but this one is a real deal. A lot of blind people tried this prescription, and they were able to see again after 49 days. But don't forget to burn incense before taking the meds. We're Christians. Just try it out anyway. Take it. At least it'll improve your health. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Waiter. - Coming. I will get to work, take your time. Daddy, what are you doing? There aren't that many miracle doctors in this world. Maybe it'll work this time. Don't you want to regain your eyesight? We're all good now. Why do we need to see? How is this good? Why isn't this good? What's the problem? We can walk, eat, and sleep, right? We're just as happy. Don't you want to know what the world looks like? I don't need to, I can hear the news. The world is an absolute mess. How about me? Don't you want to see my face? How would you recognize me if you haven't seen my face? I just have to hold your hand and then touch your face. And go on to rub your ears, then I'll know it's you. I'll tickle you, listen to your laugh, then we'll know it's you, babe Yan Yan. You always make fun of me. Yan Yan, come over here. Let me check your clothes and see if they're neat and tidy. Why did you miss a button again? You have to wear your clothes neatly. Don't be messy about it, okay? Okay. All right. - Goodbye, honey. - Goodbye, Mom. Bye. I'll shut the door. Look at that, it's beautiful. - Three colors... - Come and have a look. Yan Yan, are there any available spots? - There's an empty space. - Take me there. This design is good. - Right here. - Come check it out... It's cotton. Right here? All right. Hold this for me. Come around, and have a look. How much are the insect repellant pellets? I've just opened up, I'll give you a discount. - Four packs for ten dollars. - Okay, give me four packs. Honey, collect the cash. Count and make sure it's ten dollars. Hey, who dares taken my spot? Get lost, this is my spot. Brother, these spaces are first come first served. Can't you see that I had a box there reserving the space? I really couldn't see it. You blind jerk. Don't be angry, there's a lot of space. I can't use it all, I'll just move to the side. We can both set up our stall, and earn a living. Babe Yan, come and help. Move it across. Move it across and we'll all be happy. Only you'd dare to argue with him. He looks so intimidating, but turns out he's only posing. I'm just reasoning with him, and besides, I can't even see his face. You're right. Come around, and have a look. - Hey, cops are coming. - Come... - Cops... - Cops? Yan, let's go. Get out of here. Let's go! Stop packing, let's go. They'd let me go because I'm blind, but they'll arrest you. - Give me your hand. - Stop! Still trying to run? Is it my little Yan? Mom! You two had me worried. How are you? Are you hurt? I'm fine, but dad lost all his stuff. From now on, you're not allowed to go out with Dad, got it? Okay. Go wash your hands. You... what were you thinking? Why did you stop to help someone when you knew the cops were coming? What am I going to do if you went to jail? I won't go to jail so easily. You're too paranoid, it's fine. You're always like this. Let's have dinner. It's fine. It'll be fine. - Honey. - Yes? Maybe I should find work at the shelter. Our daughter is old enough, I have more leisure time. Of course not. You just stay home and take care of Yan Yan. Let me take care of the rest. What do you plan on doing? I'll be a masseur. My friend told me that blind masseurs get paid well. It'll be multiple of what I'm getting now. How does that sound, Babe Yan? Babe Yan? What is it? Her body is burning up. What? What's happening? She's having a fever. - We have to take her to the doctor. - Okay. - Let's go, grab your things. - Okay. - You'll have to lead the way. - Yes. I'm so scared. This fever might lead to something worse. Don't be afraid. I had a fever like this when I was a kid. Then, I lost my vision. She's really burning up. Let's give her more anti-fever medication. Why is the rubber band gone? What? The rubber band is gone. How could this be? So careless. The nurse put a rubber band around the fever reducer. Honey, we can't let her take the wrong medicine. The nurse said the fever reducer is grape flavored. Don't rush me. Take your time. - We can't make mistakes. - Try this one. Is it this one? Yes, this is grape flavored. Yan Yan, get up. It's time for your meds. Don't be afraid, it'll be fine. It's just a fever. You'll get better soon. Yan Yan, come on. Open up. Come on. Drink it. Drink it all. Your stuff is everywhere. Yan, help me pick up the fork. Yan, pick up the fork for me please. Yan. -Your mom needs your help -What's all this noise? - Can you hear her? - Dad, you've woken me up. Woken you up? It's time to go. Dad, why did you wake me up so late? I'm going to be late. The alarm went off, but you were still sleeping. So I didn't want to wake you. I need to go to school. I'm late and I have friends waiting for me. Go help your mother, otherwise she'll be angry. Yan, help me pick up the fork, please. Pick up the fork please, it might injure someone. It's next to your feet. Can't you help me? Where is it? Behind you. Closer to your body. Yan, what's going on with my clothes? These socks don't match. They're of the same pair. No way, they're different in length. I'll be laughed at if my socks don't match. Find me the other one. Dad, just wear another pair for now. I'll handle it later, I'm going to be late. Okay, I'll find it myself. Hey! Come over here. Come on. Aren't you going to be late? Mom, hurry up or I'll be late. All right. Sorry, I'm late. Let's go. No worries, you've got me. One more kick. Don't be afraid. All right, everyone. We'll be practicing blind drawing today. Pick any object from the classroom. Examine it for ten seconds, then close your eyes. Draw whatever stayed in your mind. Don't worry, just go for it. There's no right or wrong in art. We're restricted by what we can see, but there are a lot of things that we can't see, like intuition, and feelings. If we don't put any feeling into a painting, then we've simply just put paint on a canvas. Okay, this is Classic of Poetry, Zhi Hu. It's written by "Anonymous". What does that mean? It means the author is unknown. There were lots of people who didn't have names back then. What is "Xi'? It's the way I sigh when I see you all. That's right, you're a smart bunch. Let's go eat. - What should we eat? - Sandwich? - Dumplings. - McNuggets. Chu Tsz-Yan. You've applied for the London Arts School scholarship. They're sending some people over to interview you. Be very well prepared. This scholarship is not easy to get. I'll prepare a few more drawings to show them. Good to show that you have heart. Ms. Chan. Do you have more information about art schools abroad? Where do you want to go? Not every school offers scholarships. I can go anywhere, as long as it's not in Hong Kong. Why is that? I want to leave. It's good to study abroad, but if it's to escape something, it might cause you even more suffering. Leaving will not solve any problems. But these problems are unsolvable anyway. Ryan. Well done, Ryan! Bravo! All stand over there. Catch it. Are you okay? - Where are you injured? - It hurts. - Is it here? - Here. - Right here? - Lower. - Here? - Yes. Go easy. Is it here? - You scared me. - Ouch. - This really hurts. - Still pretending? This hurts even more. Where do we go after school? After school? Let's go karaoke. Sure. My treat. Okay, they want to go karaoke. - Really? Your treat? - Yes. Summer, let's go together. My mom's in the hospital, I have to go see her. You guys go ahead, I'll join you later. It's okay, we'll sing while waiting for you. - Which one should we go? - Let's go. - Bye. - Let's get changed. Your sweat stinks! - Thank you. - Such a good girl. You do grocery shopping for your mom every day. I've bought everything you asked for. Put the stuff down, let's head out. Where are we going? I'm not free, I need to see my friends. You can see your friends any time. We're going to save lives. Don't you go to the center by yourself usually? Can't you go by yourself? I haven't been to this place before. Why didn't you mention earlier? What's the problem? Do I need a reservation to ask for your help? Help? I'm helping you every day. I'm just blind, I'm not deaf. Let's go. Slow down, do you want me to trip and fall? Mom, which one is it? Room 224. -Here we are, -Okay. Yee? Is it Hung? Yes, I've brought you all some food. Thank you Hung, please come in. I didn't expect both of us getting the flu. Our social worker got sick as well. Isn't that so unlucky? Don't worry too much, it's just the flu. Take some time to rest. You're held up in this house too long. It'll make you unhappy and unhealthy. Let's go exercise together after you recover. Hung, it's not that easy. I still have to take care of this little one. Okay, food is ready. Thank you, Yan. I'll go feed the little rascal first. Have a seat. Let's have a chat. Yan, you go feed the kid, please. Yan is such a good girl. She can see, of course I'd ask her to help. Kid, time to eat. This is for you. It's beautiful, thank you. Come on, eat up. Hello? Who's calling? Which classmate? It's late. Don't you have to sleep? She's not available. Why did you say I wasn't available? Why are you shouting. Are you free? I'm done with my shower. Who's next? If you're so free, go take a shower. What's that attitude? Ouch! You hit me! - Mom. - What is it? I've learned some new tricks. - It feels good. - Stay away from me. - Doesn't that feel good? - Get off of me. Let's go inside, you can try it out. What are you guys laughing at? Look, a "Blind Persons Stargazing" event. How can blind people star-gaze? Is this a joke? Yes, what a joke. Can blind people touch the stars? Do you call that "blind touch"? Ryan: Will you come to my birthday party? Someone has been dodging my calls, so I will try using a beeper. How did you open my locker? This kind of combination lock is a piece of cake for me. Did you try every single combination? Don't mind me, are you coming? - We'll see. - We'll see? What is there to see? - Depends on my mood. - Again with your moods. Stop bothering me. If you can't, then just leave me a message. You'll know when the time comes. By then I'll know if you can come, right? The current time is 9:50 a.m. Three, four, five. Well done, everyone. You can do a few sets on your own. I'll come around and see how you're doing. Yee, warming up is very important. You can't skip it. Last time, I ran without warming up, and I got a leg cramp. Hung, thanks for bringing me here, but I'm scared I can't keep up. It's okay, we have a guide runner. Keep it slow and steady, and you can speed up gradually. You'll get used to it eventually. Are you guys ready? Guide runners, you can start leading your athletes. Okay, let's go. One, two, one two... Okay, Mr. Chan. - We're all done. - Thanks for that. Remember to drink more warm water, okay? Come again next time. How can this be? This is ridiculous. Are you going to sign it? What would I do if I don't sign? What? Sign what? Chu, you come at the right time. While you're working just now, the receptionist handed us this new employment contract and asked us all to sign. Have a look. They're cutting our basic salaries by 20% and increasing their commission by 20%. They've been taking 50% commission. If they take another 20%, we won't get anything. She said, you sign or you quit. That makes no sense. Both parties need to agree to change contract terms. This is completely one-sided, I'm not signing it. They're bullying us. The way I see it, sign it or not, we're damned. Exactly. Not necessarily. I'll go speak to the boss about it. Most importantly, don't sign anything yet. - Got it? - All right. That's all set then. How's this one with lace? I hate pink. This fabric is nice. It's so smooth, it won't pill. Mom, what the heck? Who would wear black to a birthday party? How would I know it's black? These two dresses suit you, give it a try. Sure - Mom, I'll try them on. - Okay. - There's a chair here. - Okay. Hey, try this one. This is so old fashioned, it would suit Summer better. She's really dowdy, pretending to be the girl next door. I don't know why Ryan would like her. She doesn't even go out late at night. These girls attract guys the most. I'd say she's just horny. Ryan, I'm waiting for you tonight. I can't wait until tonight. Wait for me. This looks nice, you carry it well. Really? Let me feel it. Where's the fabric? - There is no fabric in the front or back. - Forget it. I'll put on the other one. This one's nice. Is it? Let me feel it. This one seems nice. Miss, how much is this? 580 dollars after discount. So expensive? Why is there a hole in the back? What hole? It's the design. No. You'll catch a cold, and we'll have to see a doctor. Lower your voice, other people are staring. Let them, I can't tell if they're staring at me, and I can't see them. Pick another one, or I won't pay. What's the point? Everything I choose is wrong. You make the choices anyway. I'm not buying it. Chu Tsz-Yan. Your mom just called and asked for you to go home. Now? Yes. She said she's bleeding. Hurry up. Chu Tsz-Yan, it's your turn. - Let me check. - It's still bleeding. Don't worry, let me have a look. Relax. Okay. Okay. Doctor, why was my mom's nose bleeding so much? The capillaries inside her nose have burst. I've stopped the bleeding. What happened to my nose? Why did the capillaries burst? Ma'am, did you pick your nose with your finger? I felt that there was a booger stuck in there, so I picked it. What? You picked your nose? Don't use your finger to pick your nose next time. There are a lot of germs on your hands. If this happens again, use a cotton bud, and moisten the tip, carefully pick it out, understood? We should be all set, don't forget your meds I'll prescribe you some nose drops. - Thank you, doctor. - You're welcome, take care. You picked your nose? Do you know that I had an important interview today? You didn't tell me. Right, you don't know anything. You only know how to bother me when you're in need. All right, I won't bother you anymore. I can go to the doctor by myself with my white cane. Right. The white cane can call you a cab, fill in your forms, get your meds, and pay for you. Too bad your mom is blind. You can't say that every time we argue. Being blind is not the trump card. I don't want to bother you either. But am I supposed to ask an outsider for help? People know that I have a daughter. If they ask where my daughter is, how would I answer them? I'm your daughter, but I'm not your white cane. I can't just show up on demand. Mom, I'm all grown up. I have things that I want to do, okay? You keep saying that you're grown up. But do you remember who raised you? So you want me to drop everything I'm doing, to stay here with no friends, no aspirations, nothing, and spend the rest of my life with you? Is that really what you want? Actually, I didn't study art in university. I studied economics. When I was a kid, I loved to paint, but all the equipment were too expensive. My mother couldn't afford it, so I gave it up. After I graduated university, I met my art teacher again. She asked me, "Are you still painting?" She still remembered the first painting I submitted to her. Then, I kept working and saving money. Finally, I used my savings to study Master of Fine Arts in London. Every time when I felt like giving up, I'd ask myself, what made me fall in love with it? The sweet smell of durian, sound of songs rock the sky The sweet smell of durian, lingers on my lips Thank you. Stay healthy. - Having fun today? - Yes. Thank you. Smile. Community Concert Cheers! Hung, I really admire you. You're still so cheerful even after arguing with your daughter. I'm here as a volunteer. I shouldn't meet these elders with a frown on my face. You're right, if it wasn't for you, I couldn't imagine that I would be helping people. These elderlies are in a nursing home because their children don't have time to take care of them, or they're sent in here because their children don't care. I'm grateful to have my daughter by my side. It's better than nothing. That's true. Why are you unhappy? It's just an argument. I argue with my mom every day, I just take it as she's singing. You won't understand. Why do you want to study abroad so badly? I don't want to go, even my parents will pay for it. It's freedom. I want freedom, do you get it? Soy sauce? I get it. I'll get you some tomorrow. Is one enough? Or should I get two, or four bottles? - Come on, smile. - Ryan, it's your turn. Okay, I'm coming. Let's go. Happy birthday! Congratulations on your birthday The current time is 12:27 a.m. It's so late already. Mom, Dad, I'm home. You come home now? Yan, remember, you have to tell us if you're coming home late, so we won't worry about you. Okay. Yan, get over here. - Come over. - What is it? Have you been smoking? I haven't. It's just my friends smoking in the room. Smoking is no different from drugs. You can't stop once you started. I've told you I didn't smoke. Why won't you believe me? She said she didn't smoke. A lot of people smoke in my work place, and I end up smelling like cigarettes. It's okay. Go to bed. We'll talk about this tomorrow. I'm always the bad guy, and you're the good guy. It's my bad. That class was incredibly boring. Let's go have steak in Prince Edward. What is it? I forgot something. It's okay, let's go. There's an amazing steakhouse in Prince Edward. Mom, I'm home. Why are you back so late? Yes, I had extra classes. You've never mentioned that. They were unplanned. Which teacher's class? Let me call the school and ask. What are you doing? I'm just blind, I'm not silly. I was at your school today. You walked right past me with a guy. What is it? Are you ashamed of me? Why were you waiting for me at my school? Can't a mother pick her daughter up from school? Do you know that you're insufferable? I'm insufferable? What's that noise? My pager. Why do you have a pager? Who gave it to you? You're crazy, I don't want to talk to you. Stand right there. Are you trying to be a call girl? A friend gave it to me. On call anytime? Why are you controlling me? You're my daughter, why can't I control you? What? I know you're glaring at me. You want to beat me up? Hey, why do you get into my room? Open the door! Open up! What are you doing in my room? Open the door! Brat, open up! Open the door. What is this? Revenge? Yes, we're even. What do you mean we're even? I gave birth to you. I raised you from the beginning. I took you to school, prepared you meals, and took care of you. How are we even? I didn't ask to be born. You gave birth to me just so you could have a volunteer on demand. You ungrateful brat, I shouldn't have given birth to you. You think I wanted to be born into this family? Have you asked me? Did I have a choice? The current time is 2:00 a.m. The current time is 2:00 a.m. Honey, it's so late. Why isn't Yan back home yet? I've told you before. She's grown up now, she has her own opinions. You can't yell at her all the time. The current time is 2:01 a.m. What is the topic of today's program? I don't know. Come on, I gave you the details last night. Is that so? Okay then. Thank you, Ms. Chan. Honey, what is it? Ms. Chan said Yan didn't show up at school today. She didn't go to school, and she didn't come home. Where could she go all through the night? Early this morning, the police discovered a body of a young female at the Hung Hom Pier. Turn it up. -Hurry up -Approximately 16-17 years old... 1.7 meters tall, long hair, wearing a t-shirt... It can't be her... The time of death was around 11:00 p.m. last night. Come on, hurry up... They're here to identify the body. - Okay, I'll handle it. - Okay. - Sir... - Please have a seat. I had an argument with my daughter last night. She left home and never returned. And then I heard on the radio that a body was found. - It might be our girl. - It can't be... I understand. But both of you cannot see, how can you identify her? It's not a problem. Though neither of us can see, we've touched her since she was little. We can tell. Wait, you want to touch the body? Yes, I beg you. Just let us touch her, and we'll know. - Please. - Yes, rest assured, - our hands are our eyes. - Yes. Go ahead. Don't you want to see my face? How would you recognize me if you haven't seen my face? I just have to hold your hand, and then touch your face. Then I'll know it's you. No... it's not Yan. She has a scar on her arm, this girl doesn't. You should be relieved that this isn't your daughter. Where else can she go? You should search for her in places she used to hang out. - Yan? - Tsz-Yan? - Yan? - Tsz-Yan! Where are you, Yan? What is it? Can I help? - Mrs. Cheung? - Yes, it's me. - Have you seen my daughter, Yan? - Have you? I haven't, what's going on? She didn't come home last night. Anybody there? Is anybody there? I can hear someone's there. Sir, have you seen this girl? - No. - You haven't? Give it to me. It's yummy. - Hey! - What's up? Let's take it up a notch. - Let's go. - Where are we going? - You'll see when we get there. - Come on. - Tell me. - Let's go. 12.50 dollars. Do you need a bag? I'm sorry. I'll help you with that. Thank you. Stop right there. I had my eyes on you guys. Hand over your bags. What's inside? Open them. You as well. Are you with them? We don't know her. What is this? Is this yours? Did you pay for it? Show me your ID. Hurry up. Mom! Mom? - Yan Yan? - Yes? What else do you see? I see a lot of clouds, and one of them looks like a big whale with a big castle on its back. There are lots of fish swimming around it, and there's seaweed floating underneath. Isn't that beautiful? Lunch menu... sausage, ham, red sausage, fried egg, scrambled eggs, sunny-side up, pork with pickled vegetables, twice-cooked pork, spiced pork cubes, satay beef... I'm sorry, Yan Yan. You got hurt because I didn't take good care of you. When you were crying just now, my heart was aching so badly. I was thinking, perhaps I shouldn't be a mother. I'm sorry. I'll take good care of you from now on. I won't let you get hurt again. I've brought you into this world not because I'm selfish. I want you to see how beautiful the world is. I've seen it when I was a child. It's truly beautiful. Honey, let's stop searching and head home. I'm a disgrace. I should've listened to you and communicated with her. Now she's decided to leave home. Families argue, and sometimes words are hurtful. Don't put it to heart. I'm not qualified to be a mother. I didn't take good care of her when she was young. I spilled a pot of boiling congee on her. Now she has a scar for the rest of her life. When she's old enough to go to school, I haven't sent her to a better school. Now I don't know whom she's hanging out with. If something happens to her, I don't know what I can do. - What can I do? - Honey... I'm terrified... I'm scared that she's been scammed. I'm scared of her getting hurt. I'm scared that she'll leave us behind one day. What do I do? Honey, that won't happen. She's grown up, we have to let go. I can't! I can't let go! Come on honey, don't be like this. Yan! - Honey. - Yan... Mom. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - Yan! - I'm sorry, Mom. - Yan. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Dad, come and feel this. This tree is 6 meters tall. - Yes... it's a banyan tree. - Yes. There are roots, you see? What roots? You mean your stubble? My stubble isn't that thick. Where is it? Let me touch it. Right here, Mom. Yan, about the shoplifting incident, my mom settled it for me. I'm free of any charges. But she won't let me stay in Hong Kong. I'm going to study in Canada. And my parents are moving there with me. It's my turn to lose my freedom now. Anyways, take care of yourself. If you're ever in Canada, come find me. Finally, I hope you find your own "soy sauce." Love always, Ryan. - Would you like to reserve for next time? - Sure. - See you. - It's not that. This contract is not reasonable, boss. We've talked about it, and we won't sign it. Then don't sign it. But I'm warning you, don't stir up any trouble. Honey, are you singing at the community center tomorrow? - Yes. Time to eat. - I'll go with you. Why are you going with me? Don't you have to work? I took a day off, just to relax a bit. Normally you wouldn't take a day off even if you're sick. Why rest now? What's wrong? I had an argument with the manager, and he told me not to show up again. What? Dad, you got fired? It's nothing, I'll find something else in no time. I'm not afraid. Why did they fire you? There was a new contract, it was unreasonable. And you spoke up against it? We're all on the same boat. Of course I'd speak up for us. Only a dumb person would be so rash. Don't worry. How can I not worry? Your daughter is going to university next year. How can we afford it? How can I not worry? Mom... Dad? Does your hand hurt? I'm just massaging it while thinking about my pals at work... Come on... Dad. Maybe I should start working. Don't you even think about it. Your dad is a tough cookie. I'll be able to put you through university. Everyone's a university graduate nowadays. How can my daughter not be one? People say that daughters are their father's lover in a past life, and their wives are the lovers in this life. Yes, I think so too. Can I be with you two again in my next life? Don't you think mom can be really annoying sometimes? Yes, she can be a bit petty. But she did everything for our benefit. In order to properly take care of you, she learned to change diapers, prepare milk, cook, and she often cut her hand with knife while preparing food. She never complained. She gave her life and soul for this family. And now that I've lost my job, she must be really worried. Dad, you're so understanding. No wonder mom likes you so much. You're wrong. Your mom likes me because I sing well, and I'm really good at playing harmonica. When I was courting your mother, we used to jam together all the time. Blind Community Singing Performance Sister loves brother Brother loves sister's charm For the lover's dream It is like connecting two branches Separated by water Not knowing when we'll be reunited Reminiscing our time together But memories fade Speaking of romance with myself But thinking of you We are separated by water Not knowing when we'll be reunited - What happened? - Did he just pass out? - How is he? - What's going on? Dad! - He passed out. - Is he okay? What happened? Keung! Is it my husband? - Keung, how are you doing? - Dad! What happened? Mom, dad fainted. - Call an ambulance! - Wake up. I just hit the jackpot. I've never been so lucky in my life to have a flat. Now I have two flats. One is for me, and the other, I can rent it out. You're still making jokes? The doctor said you have stage three bowel cancer. You need surgery right away. The doctors always exaggerate and make it sound scary. How else can they get money from us? How much money can they get? If you don't have surgery, the cancer is going to spread. If I go into surgery, then what's going to happen to my fellow workers? They look up to me. Don't just think about your fellow workers. Take care of yourself first. They have elders and children to support. I'm lucky to have an abled daughter to care for me. I don't care, you have to go into surgery. Otherwise, I won't let you leave this room. I'm hungry, my stomach is growling. Dad, what do you want to eat? - Chicken leg. - You wish. Get him plain congee. Mom... I'd rather die than eat plain congee. Why would you say stuff like that? - Mom, just let dad eat it. - Exactly. No way. If I can have a chicken leg, I can die in peace. You infuriate me! - I'll buy it for you. - Chicken leg. No, have plain congee. Hey, save a chicken leg for your dad. I already did. Take his portable radio. He can listen to the horse races when he's bored. Okay. - Mom? - What is it? Aren't you mad at dad? What for? Mad that he's always helping people, and that costed him his job. The most important thing to your dad is helping people. Now that he's in hospital, I want him to feel at ease. I want to help him as much as I can. But I'm just a woman. How can I help? What do you mean? You have me. If we work together, we're the newest Super Woman combo. Don't just ramble on. I'm not rambling! I've done my research. We can get in touch with two district councilors, and they'll be able to help with anything. Can we do that? We can make some posters... We have more than 20 posters now. That's not enough, we need to make more. Mom, check it out. Please support us. Supporting blind masseurs. Speak up for the blind. Supporting blind masseurs? Please support us. We really need your help. Poon, we just have to step up. We can succeed if we work together. Please support our press conference. We fight for the rights for the blind. I'd like you to support us. Please support us. - Honey. - Yes? Thank you for all you've done. Don't mention it. Ms. Chan. You asked for me? I've got some information on an Asian Fine Art Competition. The winner gets a scholarship to study art in New York. I know time is tight, but all you need to do is hand in your work before the deadline. You've already missed the interview last time. This is a rare opportunity. Ms. Chan. There's been some complications with my family. Forget it, I won't participate. Thank you. Where's everyone? Doesn't it start at 3:00 p.m.? We have to go if no one shows up. How's the situation now? Nobody's here yet. What's going on? Is anyone going to show up? Why aren't they here yet? I have another assignment to catch. - Let's leave if nothing's happening. - It's time. Mrs. Chu, I'm District Councilor Chow. Let's take a photo... Mrs. Chu, didn't you say many blind fellow workers will come? Yes. Why no one is showing up? They promised they'd come, just wait a while longer. It'll make a huge difference if they show up. My office is just nearby. Let me know when everyone's here, okay? Let's take a photo... Mom, even the district councilor is gone. What are we going to do now? What do you mean? We are telling the fact. We're on our own, let's stop waiting. - How long we still have to wait? - Hey, seems it's starting now. Hello, our friends in the press. I'm standing here representing my husband who is staying at the hospital right now. He and his fellow workers are all blind masseurs who give their heart and soul to their company, working more than ten hours a day. Sometimes they don't have time to eat or use the toilet. They work so hard so that they can support their families. But now that the company is earning more, they have proposed an unreasonable contract and forced their staff to sign it. Otherwise, they'd be fired immediately. Mrs. Chu, are you saying that blind people can't be fired? Mrs. Chu, please say something. So blind people can't be fired? Please say something. Not all blind people can't be fired, but there needs to be a valid reason. Not all blind people can't be fired, but there needs to be a valid reason. Blind people shouldn't be bullied. We're just asking for fair treatment with a bit of dignity. We're fighting for basic labor rights, not benefits for the blind. Well said... We support you, Hung. - Yan. - Fellow workers are here. This woman made a great speech, didn't she? Of course, she's my wife. She's your wife? Well done. You guys are all here? Yes, Hung. Sorry that we're late, we had to wait for everyone to arrive. Support All of these workers have been certified as professional blind masseurs, but their bosses are not paying them fair wages. My dad wanted to fight for their rights, but he was unjustly fired. So we need to hold these employers responsible. Condemn unscrupulous employers. Pay us a reasonable salary. If you're protesting like this, you may lose your jobs. Honestly, we don't care about that. That's right, we need to tell the world about what's going on. Protest against unreasonable oppression. Fight for reasonable salaries. Protest against unreasonable oppression. Fight for reasonable salaries. Protest against unreasonable oppression. Fight for reasonable salaries. The protest by the blind masseurs has come to an end. The employer of the massage parlor has issued a statement to accept the employee's demands and has pledged not to pursue anyone involved in the protests. All staff are to return to work tomorrow. - Honey. - What is it? The congee is really bland. No, I've put enough salt. Perhaps I can't taste anything nowadays. You have to eat it anyway. You have surgery soon. - Honey. - What is it? Put down the bowl first. What's going on? We've been married for so many years, but I feel like I haven't given you a good life. I'm really sorry about that. Stop saying things like that. What? It's the truth. I wanted to ask you, if there was a next life, would you still be willing to be my wife? Of course not. You've already bothered me enough in this life. Please leave me alone in the next life. Are you serious? Yes, very serious. Eat up, "previous life". What happened? It's all over my mouth. Wipe it down, here. All handled? - Honey. - Yes? "Previous life." Aren't you embarrassed saying these things? I don't care, I can't see anyone. I can't see. But they can see us. It's okay if we can't see them. Eat up! You're really... Come on. I can taste it now. You gave up on the competition because of your parents? So what even if I win? It's pointless. I can't leave. Didn't you want to go study abroad? They can't live without me. Do you really think they can't manage without you? It's not an opinion, it's a fact I know. Forget it, Ms. Chan. You won't understand, you've never experienced it. But have you ever thought of how they managed before you were born? Just by doing the math, you haven't been with them for that long. Don't hold yourself accountable too much. Maybe you're underestimating them. Are you free on Saturday? I want to take you somewhere. Do you come here often? I come here every week or so if the weather is good, because I joined a club. It's very special, you'll see in a bit. - Hung. - Ms. Chan, is that you? Yes, Hung. I want to run two more laps today, is that okay? Sure, but I'm not your guide runner today. Is that so? Remember I told you about my talented student, but she gave up without even trying? Yes, I remember. You said I was full of positivity, that I should persuade her. - Yes, I brought her here today. - Really? Mom. Yan? Ms. Chan is my art teacher. Really? I'm passing it down to you today. Just tell your daughter how many laps you want to run. Okay. Guide runners, begin running. Here, hold the rope. Yan. Running is different from how you usually do it. You have to listen to my breathing. I have to listen to your footsteps, you understand? Ready? Let's go again. One, two three, breath, go. By the way, Yan, what do you see? There's a group of people running, lots of trees by the sides, and someone's walking his dog. That's it? That's all I can see. Do you see whales flying in the sky? And small fishes swimming around a castle, with seaweed floating underneath? What is it? Yan, I know that you've loved drawing since you were little. If that's your dream, don't give up. Are you worried about us? Dad is in the hospital. Yes, he is, but I'm here for him. I can do it. When you got sick as a kid, I took care of you. What about you? Who's going to take care of you? What else can I do? I ask you to run errands for me, because we're a family, and I trust you. If you really go to study abroad, I can manage by myself. It'll be a little more hectic, but we managed a life before you were born. Do you know what's my lifelong wish? My biggest wish is not about money or fame. I just want you to be happy, doing what you love. Mom. Come on. Giving up already? That's not the girl I know. Had enough rest? Let's keep running. We have three laps left. Three laps? You said it was two laps. Two and a half. - Mom, I'm so tired. - Come on. - I can't run anymore. - Let's run a little longer. Keep pushing on... Where? Here, Dad. Yes. It's a banana boat. That's our family on the banana boat. That's mom, this one is you. Why can't I feel the boat? It's here. Is that you raising your arms? You're reaching for the stars. This is also a star. Yes. The sky is filled with stars. That's right. Our little Yan is such a talented girl. This is such a bright idea. Can I touch the boat again? Here. Take it. There's something written underneath. Is that the theme of this art piece? Yes, Mom. Yan? Did you buy what I asked for? Of course, Dad. This is yours. Mom, here's yours. I have one too? What did you get for your dad? - Dad's favorite chicken leg. - Exactly. The nurse is not going to be happy about this. Screw it all, and have a chicken leg. They can't see us. I won't care even if they do see us. Just have a little bit. Dad. Are you drinking beer? Beer and chicken leg, best combo ever. The nurse is going to scold us. Drinking an ice cold beer Singing at the top of my lungs Don't dwell in previous sorrows It'll just make you mad I don't have a care in the world Living carefree Three meals a day is all I need Totally free from worries Don't blame people for changing partners Love is but a mirage There's never been perfect couple Splitting up is destiny Drinking an ice cold beer Singing at the top of my lungs Don't dwell in previous sorrows It'll just make you mad I suspect far away in space God is ruling over the earth Better see it through Success or defeat is not up to you Better see it through Success or defeat is not up to you Dedicated to my blind parents Dad, Mom. Thank you for giving me a pair of big and healthy eyes, so that I can see the world in all its beauty. Father passed away peacefully on 24 February 2018
