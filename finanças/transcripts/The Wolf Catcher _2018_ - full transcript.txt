The DEA's declined to comment if Morgan is even part of the agency or not. You know what, he'll be in a few minutes. Why don't you ask him yourselves? Well, I'd like to hear your opinion. Okay, well. The US Drug Enforcement Agency has labeled Morgan as the golden child around here. You know he's earned multiple plaudits for his work for the DEA with the New Orleans field division. There's also a legend of him being known as the "White Devil". Yeah, the "White Devil", how crazy is that? There's also a rapper out of Houston who's done some name checking and called Morgan out in one of his songs. You know Morgan has the balls to play that song every time he does a drug arrest? Wow. That's some crazy shit. Hello, Sherri. Hey. Ruiz! What's going on? What you doing out here, brother? Not too bad, not too bad. What are you doing here? He's here for the debriefing of the case.

I don't know nothing about that. You sure about that? We'll see. Sit, motherfucker! Drop your ass. Sit your ass down, get down! Right now! You're gonna tell me everything I motherfucking need to know. Right now. I got the info I needed and it all points to a guy named Fabian. If I find him, I find Clavo. Come on Sherri. What do we got here? We got the Torres gang warehouses getting killed. These aren't just regular warehouses, all right? These are the main focus points of the Torres Cartel hit. People beaten, left alive, barely. We got the Ramirez residence, again, a Torres Cartel. Are you telling me that they're organized, that this is maybe a rival gang? Maybe the same person and maybe the same people. The shit was tactical. All I know that it was cool, it was calm, collected. With pinpoint accuracy. No drugs, no money. No murders. All I know that they were looking for something, collecting information, hunting. For what? Or who. Man it's that dude, man! Dustin, come here. There's a bag in the back. Whatever you do, hide the bag. I trust you. I got you, bro. Lay in the bag, man. You hear me? hand over the bag. You looking for me, What is it, Sherri? What'd you call me down here for? Morgan, I really fucked up. Everybody fucks up. What, they kick you out the case too? No, I'm in trouble, I fucked up. What is it? Look, I think I know who's behind the home invasions and the warehouse busts. Oh my god, oh my god. And? It's a friend. His name is Timothy. And actually, he's a brother of one of the victims from the 45 - South crime scene. - Fuck. You need to tell me everything. You know I can help you. Okay. He's a childhood friend. And I may have slipped and told him something I shouldn't have, but he is a really, really good person. Oh my god, oh my god. Oh my god, my career's gonna be over! Where you going? What am I gonna do, what am I gonna do? Sherri, get over here! Where is he? Where is he? He's at the hotel on 35 and Walnut Hill. Fuck! Come on, motherfucker. Can't believe this shit was a setup by Lorenzo and his cousin Clavo. Good thing I split the bag to buy me some time. But ain't no telling how much. All this shit for some extra cash. Where's Fabian and who are you? I know you got something to do with this shit. Bro, I got nothing to do with this shit. Shut up, get down! Get down! Who the fuck are you? Who are you, stop! Stop, put the gun down. No, put your gun down. Put the gun down, DEA. You're interfering in a Federal investigation. Put it down, get on you knees. Put the gun down. Put it down. I swear, I'll shoot your ass. Listen, there's bigger things going on here than me or you, but you gotta listen to me. There's something bigger going on here. It's bigger than the both of us. Now you're military, right? Yeah. What the fuck that got to do with it? Listen, I've been on you all the way down 45 South and I know a lot about you, son. There's some people you want to get to and I can help you get there. Now listen first, I need to know something. Before I call this in, do you have a bag? I got a bag. All of it? Nah, I just got half. Shit, the Cartel got it. They said he go killed a guy. They kidnapped him. That's my friend Fabian. Yo, shut the fuck up. Calm down, we'll figure this out. Just listen to me, hear me out. Clavo has a farm right off the border of Mexico. That's where we'll go. Right now he thinks we're gonna make a deal in two days. But we're gonna ambush him in one. Listen up. If you want to have any chance of getting your friend back. Our getaway vehicle is gonna be on the south side near the stream. Now we're gonna split up into two teams. We're gonna need a group of trustworthy guys. I'm gonna have to fly under the radar on this one so that means no backup. So do you have a group of guys? Yeah, I got some guys. We enter from the south. I'm gonna take the stream. You're gonna take a couple guys towards the horse stalls. That's where your friend's gonna be. The bag's gonna be over here. Listen, we got seven, 10 minutes tops before Clavo's men are all over us. Then shit's gonna hit the fan. Can you do this? Yeah, let me ask you a question. What if we get in here and the money's not here and their friend ain't there? Listen. This is not a marriage of convenience. We get in, we get out. If you're not back at the getaway car when I'm there, I'm gone, buddy. And I'd expect the same from you. Can you do this? I can do it. But this ain't a guarantee. Neither is life, buddy. Just roll with it. Let's lock and load. It's gonna be a long road. Take the night off. Do what you gotta do. We'll meet tomorrow morning and go from there. What the fuck is that, man? I thought you was out of this shit. I know. So what now? I'm gonna find that motherfucker. And I'm gonna kill him. Nigger, you trying to go to Mexico with them Cartel niggers? Man you out your goddamn mind. Hell no. I'm gonna need a favor. You done ran out of all your favors with me. But since you my nigger, I'ma hold you down. I'ma hold you down. Get your ass out. You don't get two shots. We're gonna go in through the south side, in the stream, just like we talked about in the plan. We split off. Son, you're coming with me. You guys split off and go the other way. You staying with the car? All right. Let's go. This can hide the moon, fucker. and make sure everything's straight from this point. Right, I got you. Bro, I do not trust that coon. He got a little antsy inconsistencies and shit. I'ma watch him real close. If it boil down to it, I should just put some on his ass, let him shoot it out with the Cartel. Fuck, that's what I wanna do. It is what it is. Hey man. You get in there, and making me sit here, ain't no going back. Hey man. You ready bro? Yeah. Yeah I'm ready, man. So we're here, look. We're here. I'm not gonna lie, bro. I'm kind of everywhere but, I got you. We better get a move on. You guys ready to roll? Yeah, let's do it. Let's do this. We'd have to split up. White T-shirt, go with him. Big guy, you're up with me. Let's roll. I don't think I could do this shit, bro. What the fuck you mean? I mean I never killed nobody. What the fuck? Get it together!

And always pull through and protect your family. I'm an American Soldier. I'm a warrior and a member of a team. A warrior and a member of a team. I will never quit. Never leave a fallen comrade. Help! I'll take care of my brother and I'll take care of my family. Dad, Jojo keep getting on my nerves. Always pull through and protect your family. Be there for them, you know. But at the end of the day don't ever throw your life away. Okay, I'll take care of them. Never throw your life away. Protect your family. And I'll never throw my life away. Hey dad, it's me Morgan. By the time you read this letter, I'll be well on my way to prison. But I accept the consequences of my actions. I guess you were right. I was a poor excuse for a detective. And even worse, as a son. I wish it was me you lost as a son and not Peter. But I could never take his place. Not even in death. So take care, old man. Maybe one day we'll meet again. Morgan. Fabian! What's up?
