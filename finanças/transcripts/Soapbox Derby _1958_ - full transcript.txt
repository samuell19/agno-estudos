(bells chiming) (soft music) (whistling) Legs Johnson. Hello Peter. Queue down below. Come on. (soft music) Now, we're gonna build a car. We're gonna enter it for the Soap Box Grand Prix. Now, it says here, the heats, here we are, the heats are on the 14th of June. We've gotta have our car built by then. What do you use horse oil for? It's not horse oil, it's embrocation. Why are you called Foureyes? One, two, three, four. I get it. Foureyes. Now, Foureyes, swear after me. I swear to honor my gang, the Battersea Bats, to help them with their racing car, and especially to keep the secret and not to tell anyone what we're doing, especially that snooping Bunch, The Victorias. I swear. Next. Name. Lew Lender. Now, you must swear to honor the Battersea Bats, and to obey the rules of our gang. Oh no, not all that nonsense. It's not nonsense. (dramatic music) Legs, have a squinter outside. We'll try to get inside. I can't see anybody. Well, we've gotta be careful. We don't want anybody dropping in. (dramatic music) The Victorias. That's dirty fighting. (dramatic music) Help, he's fallen in. Help. Someone's fallen in. Quick! Help, I can't swim. Legs, get some rope. Come on, we've got rush and rescue. Rope. Hold on to it. Help me up now. Grandpa, grandpa. Get the life raft. Somebody's fallen in. Oh, do hurry up grandpa. Hold on, he's coming, just hold on. Here comes grandpa. Hold on. Come on. Here he comes. All right, leave it to me, boys. Leave it to me. Hang on, hang on. Give 'em a hand. Let's go. That's it, come on. Give 'em a hand, come on. Are you all right, Fred? Yes. Thank you, grandpa. It's lucky you fell in today. Why? Look. God! My, look at that! (dramatic music) Hop in. They'll wet it, grandpa. Wet ones first. I'll race you there. Come on Batterseas. Come on, there's room for one more here. You get in, Foureyes. We don't want dirty fighters in the Batterseas. Aren't you joining the Batterseas? What, that buttoned bunch? What's their secret? My father's got a scrapyard. They wanted me to build a car so they could go in for the Soap Box Derby. So, that's it? Hey, how about joining us? I'll show those Battersea Bats. Hello, Bill. Where's Lew? We don't want him, he's a dirty fighter. I'll take Fred here across the bridge to his house. If you Victorias raid us again, we'll really let you have it. Cheerio! See you later. (car engine revving) That's what we want for our car, all the parts from a racing bike. We'll have to hurry. The Southern Counties heats are in two weeks' time. Foureyes, you're the chief designer. Let's all meet at your house in three days' time. Oh, I'll have my design ready by then. Hello, Bill. Hello, what have you been up to? Peter's been for a swim. You better get some dry clothes on. Do you know where we can get some old cranks and a three-speed gear? What for? We're building a-- Foureyes, it's a secret. Oh, Bill won't tell. You come round to my shed, I've got some old bits there. Thank you, Bill. Remember Foureyes, it's a secret. Come on, Foureyes. Some chain, two cranks and a three-speed gear. See you in three days. Cheerio! Cheerio! Grandpa! How's the car, grandpa? Jump in, I'll give you a ride. We're having a meeting at Foureyes' place. Oh, good! Can you take me there? Oh, I shall have to reverse. (car engine revving) (dramatic music) Get out of here! Go on. Sorry, I didn't mean to. I was-- Take the car around the corner, grandpa. That's a dirty trick, telling the Victoria's our secrets. Well, I joined the Victorias. Now hop it, before I knock your block off. I'd like to see you try. Dad! You heard what my son said. Hop it! (laughing) (car hooting) Go on, hop it! Are you all right, boy? I'm okay. It was that Lew's father. Hang on, boy. (laughing) Oh grandpa, you missed the turning. You'll have to reverse. Oh good! Hang on. Look out. Watch where you're going. (clamoring) Come on, get out of here. Hurry up, grandpa. Hurry up, grandpa. Peter will be waiting. Foureyes, this is wizard. Wizard? What's wizard? Why don't you go and ask your doll? I have. She doesn't know the answer (laughs). Ask a silly question and you'll get a silly answer. Oh, shut up. The driver sits here, here are the pedals and the three-speed drives the back wheels. What parts did you get from Bill? All the cranks, the chains, and the three-speed. But of course we'll need wheels, axles, and all that kinda stuff. But why don't you use the wheels from your old pram? Oh mommy, this is a proper racing car. An old pram won't do. Oh mommy, a racing car. Where are you going to race it? Foureyes, what about the axles? Wouldn't the ones from the pram do? Yeah. There, you see? It was Maurine's idea. Oh, all right Betty. Tell Maurine, thank you. (doorbell ringing) Oh Betty, see who's at the door. Yes, mommy. If you go out, take Betty with you. All right. Didn't know you still used a pram, Foureyes. The Victorias are building a car. How do you know? I've just seen it. That Lew Lender's joined them. And I had a fight with his father. That's let the cat out of the bag. What matters is we've got to build the best car. Of course, but suppose they find out our design, the three-speed gear and all that. But how can they, unless they get the plans. We've gotta be careful who we talk to. I've got a racing car. And especially that Lew Lender. And his father. Well anyway, I've made a list of all the parts we need. Oh, I'll cross the axles off. This is operation scram. And we've got hardly any money, so starting tomorrow, we've got to work hard and fast. I've still got some work to do on my design. All right, Legs and I'll get the stuff. Come on Legs, we'll see you tomorrow. Right, cheerio! Bye, Peter. Bye, Legs. I've got an idea. Come on! (dramatic music) We've got everything here, look. One, steering wheel. Two, nuts and bolt. Three, wire cable. Seven, sheet aluminum. Eight, wire. (car hooting) What are you doing here? Well, we're building a car, and we thought you might be able to help us with these parts. We break 'em and you build 'em. (laughing) All right, where's your money? We haven't got any. No money? All right, you'll have to work for them. Oh, thanks mister. Thanks mister. Get what you want. (dramatic music) Hey Legs, here's a light steering wheel. Catch! Have a nice trip (laughs). See you next fall. I need some wire. We'll show those Victorias. Here you are Lew, here's your wheels. Thanks, dad. Oh, this won't fit. We ought to have a proper design. My dad's giving us everything we want. And don't you forget it. I only said we should have a proper designer. Like the Batterseas. Yeah, they've got Foureyes. Now, he's clever. Well, I'm the designer here. And Foureyes or not, we're gonna beat those Batterseas. (gentle music) Come on, Legs. Come on! Foureyes! Did you get the stuff? Did we get it? Look! This is wizard. And there's the sheet aluminum for the body. Didn't you get any wheels? Don't worry. Look, we've got enough stuff there to build our car with. We've only got two weeks. So, why don't we spend our money on buying proper wheels? Look, it says here, wheels can be obtained from the organizers and boys are advised to use the proper wheels. Now, I'll write a letter and send a postal order off with it. Have it sent COD. Okay. COD? What's that mean? Cash on delivery. That means we pay for the wheels when they arrive. Now, come on, let's get these stuff tidied up. Give me a hand, Foureyes. My tummy says it's dinner time. All right, let's go. (dramatic music) Get in the strap and try it, Legs. How's that? The pedals are a bit too far away. That's better. Right, you can get off now, Legs. I'll get it. Battersea Bats. Yes! Here's a parcel for you. Oh, one minute please. Thank you, goodbye. Now, we've got one week. Here we are, Foureyes. Legs, you get in and try it for size. There! I can't move my legs. Heck! I'll have to redesign the whole car. But you can't. The heats are in three days' time. Well, it's no good like this. I'm sorry. I'll try and think of something tonight. Oh, blow it! Oh, Betty. (laughing) I've got it. I'll cut the steering wheel in half. Now, don't touch or I'll blow you. (gentle music) We'll try it out in the park. It goes like a bomb, Foureyes. Show me the lower gear. Come on now, let's get on with it. Ready! Steady! Hello, Peter. Hello, Foureyes. Oh, crumbs! How did she know we were here? I followed you. We've got to keep our design secret. Tell her to go away. Betty, swear you won't tell. I swear! Battersea batties (laughs). Battersea Batties. Now, come on now, let's get on with it. You ready? Right! Out of the way, Betty. Ready, steady, go! (soft music) Look! Cor, it's a smashing car. Smashing? I'll smash it. We've got to think of something. Their design is much too good. What's the matter? What have you come back for? I saw the Victorias spying on us. Where? Over there, behind those bushes. Foureyes, you get in the car and drive slowly round, as though you were testing it. Come on, Legs! Give Maurine a ride. Oh, all right. That's the chap that designed their car. That's his sister, isn't it? His sister? Is it now? Fred, take the car back to the yard. I've got an idea, a good idea. Okay. He's coming this way. Look, there they are. Clumsy clod. Doesn't look up to much. Come on, I'll alert Lew something. Come on, now's our chance. Let's go and bust their car. That's not fair. Fair? But... Take Maurine home, I'll be along later. (dramatic music) Come out and fight, you coward. And you're gonna tell your friend, Lew, to keep out of our way, see? We better take the car back. I've thought of a plan to help Legs with his driving. I lost him. Hey Legs, get in for a moment. (wacky music) I'll have to go home and get my plans. Okay, we'll take the car back. Right. See you later. Cheerio! Bye! (dramatic music) You must be a good girl because we want Foureyes to win, don't we? That's a lovely doll. What's her name? Maurine. Maurine? That's where I live. Goodbye! Go to sleep. What are you doing? We're friends, aren't we? Where does your brother keep the plans for his car? (clock chiming) Where are the plans? It's a secret. Oh no, you don't. You love Maurine, don't you? Well, tell anybody I've got the plans and I'll smash her. No! You understand? Smash her. Betty! Say anything and I'll break her into little pieces. I'm just going out to the shops. I won't be a minute. You'll be all right, only a minute. You see? I didn't really mean to hurt her. Now, remember what'll happen to Maurine. Now, look after Betty. I'll only be gone a few minutes. She'll be all right. Has mommy been clearing up in here? Have you seen my plans? Betty! What's the matter? Oh, stop fiddling with that doll. No, leave her alone. (ominous music) Betty! (car screeching) (screaming) Get an ambulance. Give way. (somber music) I'm her brother. Maurine. Where is Maurine? Her dress is all dirty. I'll bring her to the hospital. Come along now. Where's your mom? She's out. Tell her to come to the hospital as soon as she comes back. Hey! (dramatic music) You stole our plan. I did not. How did you get them? I got them from Foureyes. You're a liar. Foureyes wouldn't do that. Ask his sister. How do you think I got them? (somber music) I told you to look after her. Now, where's her doll? Oh, we can't let her see that. You wait here till I get back from the hospital. It's all your fault. You're not to be trusted. (light knocking) Did you give the plans to Lew Lender? To Lew Lender? Of course not. Well, he's got them, I saw them. And he says that he got them from you and Betty. From Betty? How did Lew get them? Did you give them to him? No, I didn't, Well, what about Betty? That's a dirty trick, accusing Betty now. Dirty trick? What about our plans? Our plans, I designed them. They belong to the Batterseas. What's it matter about the plans anyway? The heats are tomorrow, you've got the car. You've given away our secret, that's what matters. You deserve to be chopped out of the gang. All right, chop me out, I don't care. (somber music) Dad, I got the plans but I can't understand them. Ah, let me look. Well, get the designer to rebuild the car. I can't, he's a member of the Batterseas. Use your brains. There's always a way to get anyone to do anything. It's too late, the first heats are tomorrow. It's the finals that matter. (gentle music) Here they come, here they come. (crowd cheering) Victoria Victors in the next heat. Aren't you gonna join Lew? Starters for heat three. Number one, Flying Hawks, number three, Nevs Corgi, number six, Victoria Victors. On your marks. Get set. Go! (crowd cheering) (crowd cheering) The Victoria Victors won. Must be a better car than we thought. What happened to number three? He broke down. All right, Victoria Victor, you're in the finals. Ah, that's me boy. Well done, lad. Battersea Bats, you're in the finals. Congratulations. Thanks. Good to see plan car this, I'd like to congratulate the designer. Well done, boys. We better get the car back to the hideout. Yes, yes. (somber music) You must prove, I'm the champ. From the neck downwards. You're the champ. It's lucky number three broke down. Lucky, for what? We've as good as won the finals. (laughing) They think they've won. Only if you redesign this car. Otherwise the Batterseas will beat ya. I'm telling ya, that's a better car. (car engine growling) (gentle music) I've got an idea. See you later, dad. Well, make it a good one. 37 and six. Two, four, six and tuppence. Hello, Foureyes. I didn't know you liked dolls. This was my sister's. Oh yes, I'm sorry about her being run over. Aren't you going to buy her a new one? I can't, I haven't got enough money. (ominous music) Peter. You see, I told you so. Now, come on, forget about them. Join us and I'll buy you a new doll. I can't, it wouldn't be fair. Just help us with our car. Now, that's fair. And I'll buy you a new doll for your sister. It's 37 and six, but I'll pay you back. (somber music) It's your brother. Only a few minutes now. I brought Maurine. What a lovely, clean dress. I was frightened to tell you, in case he hurt her. Oh, she wasn't hurt. The lorry made her dress dirty, so I washed it for you. But you don't understand. I'm sorry, you must go now. The doctor's coming. She'll be home soon. I was frightened, I thought he'd hurt her. I wanted to tell you about the plans. Plans? Come along now. What about the plans? Tidy your hair dear, the doctor's coming. Are you sure we can beat the Battersea Bats? The Battersea Bats have the better car, and anyway, Legs Johnson is driving it. Well, you're not gonna lose, do you understand? Well, the finals are this afternoon. Here, hang on a minute. Look, you and the others take the car to the track and meet me there at two o'clock, okay? All right. Now, you're sure the Battersea Bats have a better car? I know it is. We've gotta be at the track at two o'clock. Well, my tummy says it's dinner time. Well, let's meet back her at half past one. I'm sure I've forgotten something. Probably your breakfast, come on! (ominous music) It's locked. Horse oil? Let's dump this thing in the river, Lew. Come on, Lew. Hey, I've forgotten my oil. I need it to massage my leg. Okay, meet me at two o'clock. Take this key. Right-o. Keep down, it's a piece. We better hurry, finals are at half past two. I've gotta go to the quarry, I'll dump the car there. That'll fix those Battersea Bats. (dramatic music) Hey! Peter! Foureyes! Peter, Peter. Hello, Betty. Hello, Foureyes. Peter, Peter. Emergency, hurry up. Come to grandpa's. I wish you were still friends with Legs and Peter. I've got to go. But Foureyes, I've got to tell you something. Later, I've got to go to the Victorias. But Foureyes! (dramatic music) Grandpa, grandpa. They've pinched our car. They've gone to the quarry. Can you take us there? Go on, hop in. It's that way, grandpa. You'll have to reverse. Oh, good. What do you like, what do you fancy? Help yourself, Ernie Sterile is the name and... You don't catch me this time matey. Hurry, hurry, grandpa. Come on, grandpa. (car hooting) We've just got time to dump this thing, get some dinner and get down the race track. I'd like to see their faces now. Yeah (chuckles). Hurry up, grandpa. Chuck it over the side. It'll go down the bottom and fill up. (car hooting) Dad, help! Help! (dramatic music) Grandpa, grandpa. Go down and head Lender off. Dad, help! Ooh! (dramatic music) You're okay? I don't know. Here comes grandpa. He'll give us a hand. You stay here and watch Lew. Grandpa, grandpa. Come at me and I'll scratch you like a fly. I'll teach you to hurt my son. Dad, look out. Hey. (dramatic music) (earthmover roaring) Help me, help. Help me, help. Help! (laughing) (gentle music) Help! (laughing) We have to get cracking. There's some rope in grandpa's car. Grandpa, your car's up here. Get me outta here. Get me out, help! Help! Help! (dramatic music) We'll have to tow it, grandpa. Okay, tie it on the bumper. Did you see that Lender? Hurry up, grandpa. It's nearly time for the start. (car hooting) Right, on your marks. Soap Box Grand Prix. Welcome to the finals. Will the Battersea Bats please come to the starting line? There's no sign of Lew. Foureyes, you better drive. Only two cars, what's happened to Battersea Bats? We don't know, sir. Oh, we better start without 'em. Get set. Look, sir. There they are. (crowd cheering) (dramatic music) Oh, pardon for the trouble. The Battersea Bat was stolen and thrown down the quarry. We got it together, the boys have made it, so give them a chance, will ya? My knee's too sore, you'll have to drive, Peter. Okay, I'll do my best. Oh, very well. Help them to get into their mark. That was a dirty trick, stealing our car. I didn't. Of course you did. I didn't, I tell you. Well then, your gang did. Lew and his father. All ready Batterseas? Right sir. Get set. Go! (dramatic music) (crowd cheering) Get over, you cheat. Look out. (crowd cheering) We won! (crowd cheering) Come on, come on over. Everyone else, keep back behind the ropes. Well, congratulations Battersea. You're this year's champion. Better luck next time. I must congratulate you on your car. It's the best design I've ever seen. (somber music) Foureyes, it was Lew who stole the plans. What did you say? I kept trying to tell you, it was Lew who stole the plans. Lew Lender. He said he'd break my doll if I told. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't know. I'm sorry. I should have trusted you. That's right, all friends again. There you are. Told you it was a better car. Hey! (dramatic music) (laughing) You wait. You wait, you wait!
