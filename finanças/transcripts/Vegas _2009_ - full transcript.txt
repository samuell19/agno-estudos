You and aunt Anne are the only family I have. Qm a 9??- We've tried this before. You and aunt Anne weren't exactly a super match. I was fourteen back then. I'm better now. I promise.

Mom... Roger! Wait, Roger! - Have you seen Daniel? - No. He's supposed to come next week. You aren't going to lose touch with each other. But children from troubled homes are kept separate- - until we find out how things have been. We've been just fine. I'll kill you, you bastard! Hey, Steve! Excuse me. Take it easy, Steve! Calm down! Let go of me! Can I borrow 100 kroner'? Fifty? Fine. Now you owe me fifty and I owe you fifty. So we're even. - Letgo! - Listen to me! - Kim! -Have you lost your mind?

Thomas just got here yesterday. But you've settled in fairly well, haven't you? This is temporary. Until they figure out a permanent solution. Terje came today. Terje, this is Thomas. Many find lifelong friends here. Want to watch the football game togethertomorrow? We can make waffles and argue about which team is best. Thomas? 'We'? Maybe you aren't such a big football fan? You neither? OK... At least you have something in common. That isn'tbad! If you want any other sandwich toppings, let us know. We can get you anything, except that chocolate stuff. That's too sweet. Orgooseliver. That's way too expensive. What do you usually eat? Keep going. Yourlittle brother... ls his name Daniel? They won't let you see him. Do you know why? They don't know if you're fucked up. If you're dangerous. Are you? Are you? You want to find out? I don't even know if I like you. A cigarette would be nice. You can forget about the house rules. We can come and go as we want. They can't do anything about it. - They aren't exactly ourparents. - Do you have siblings? Not thatl know of. Holy shit! Hey! - What are you doing? - Holding my breath. - On the edge of the roof? - I'm not afraid of heights. You concentrate so much on relaxing, that everything else stops up. It's like time stands still. Time stands still? What if you concentrate superhard? Can you go back in time? Hello! Hello. Nutcase. Clearly. Do you have brothers or sisters? No. Good forthem. I'll neverget any, either. We lost my mother. Lost? Where? On the ferry to Denmark. He's lost his brother. They just won't tell me where he is. Maybe they don't know. No one knows where anyone is. No one is together. Everyone is somewhere, but no one knows where. That's when it would be nice to have a dog, or something. - Don't you have a key? - Do you? Find one! Dad? No, I'm more of a dog person. Cats freak me out. Piece-of-shit cat! Nice. One for dad... One for mom... And one for ??e brother. And one for myself. Dad? Dad? 'We'? Wait, Terje! I got new sneakers! Ifs not like she needs them anymore. - They haven't found heryet. - What? Fantastic! What will you do when she shows up? You've already buried her! She'll be shocked! Ifs good yourdad has some strong pills. What? Missing people sometimes tum up again. Kama. Like that piano man in England. He turned up on some beach. He had lost his memory. Took ages to find out where he was from. Your mom may be walking around on some beach, oblivious. You neverknow. No, you don't. Maybe I could borrow them? Medicine, medicine, medicine... Come on! He'll figure it out soon enough. - That she's dead as a dodo? -Yeah. You don't need a reason to be happy, as long as you are happy. Dead as a pollock. Knock it off. Dead as a blue whiting. Blue whiting? Is that a fish? You bet! Blue whiting. Everyone who's happy, can All belong to Happyland... Everything will work out for all of us! 'We'? He's my uncle. For real. He lives with my mothefs sister. He's going to let me live with them. He misses me. Cute. Thank you. How are things here? Fine. OK. Come on. Mom? Mom? Mom. Daniel and I aren't allowed to come home until Rogerleaves. Do the authorities... Do they get to decide who I can live with? Is that any of theirbusiness? - This is justa phase. - Where is he, mom? The authorities say I can't tell you. Where is he? Hi, boss. Give me a swig. Want some? Am m? hem'? Make it yourself. Eggs and bacon. I want you to tell me where he is. - Hi. - Hi. - Are you mad at me? - No! Don't be stupid. I said it had neverhappened before. I got that part right. Are they treating you well here? Sort of. Soon we'll be together again, Daniel. And mommy? If she wants to. - We could make this nice. - Yeah. Cool. At least ifs dry. - There isn't any water. - That's what he said! There. I'm going to bring my dad to Denmark. And find her. Why don't you talk about it? Just the two of you, alone. She never made it to Denmark. How can you know? Maybe she did. I thought I'd start saving some money. Good. That's good. Gotcha! Gotcha'.! - Look at this leaf, Wenche! Beautiful. Hi, Siw. Want me to clean your room too? - Dance! - Me? No, you dance. I'll just stand here. Come on, Thorstein! - Come on! - No way! Promise me that it will work out. Thorstein! Promise me that it will work out. Soon. Do you promise? OK. Yes, I promise. Get off of there! She is my sister... They just need to see that we are happy together. That Daniel is OK here. Lillian has a job now, so they can't use that against her. -Isn't that great? At Kiwi. - No, at Rema. I can see you confusing Rimi and Rema, but Kiwi? Ifs important that they see that you and Daniel are happy. She's here. Don't wony. Sony about that. Christ... - Rogerhas made venison stew. - Lovely. H?Pe you're "game... Could you...serve? Me? Water? - Yes, please. Thank you. There! Cheers. - Cheers, Daniel. - Cheers. No! I'm sorry. Shit! Come here. I'm sorry. Ifs OK. You were just worried that you couldn't come home again. She understands that. Right? He has to go, doesn'the? He has to go. He has to go. At leastl have a job. They can't use that against us. Did you buy everything in the store? We have to celebrate. Don't know how long we'll have together. I'm going to Denmark with dad. You're going home. They'll love me! Uncle Thorstein is taking care of it. How much have you saved? 480 kroner. Didn't you almost have 1000? Yes. Is it wrong thatl never contribute any money? Like I said: You just geta key. -Isn't there an alarm here? - Sure. My birthday. They're collecting money for some new penguins. But how many penguins do you need? Ifs important thatl don't freeload. All yours, nut case! Are they all related? Hening have millions of offspring. I don't think they know who's a mom, dad, sisterorbrother. But who really knows that? I do. You think you do. But you don't know. We don't know. - What do you mean by that? - I have a father. Someone who knocked up my mother. But he may have slept around with a lot of otherwomen. Like your mom. Or yours. Both of you. - So we're siblings? Brothers and sisters, man. - Hi! - Hi. - Are you at work? - Come on. Get out of here. You stay here. Do... Do-de-do-de-do... This isn't cool. Not atall. - At least my mom is somewhere warm. - Where? Las Vegas. What's she do there? Works ata casino. Makes a fortune. She keeps wanting me to come visit. But she's given up asking me. She asks my aunt instead. Caesars Palace. it's awesome! Give ten dollars to the doorman before you go in. Then he'll rememberyou if you get in trouble. - Let's give him thirty. -And you wonderwhy you're broke? Don't play the slots. They're for the tourists. Buljusl past the slots is the Million Dollar Mill. We play forloo dollars. Not 10, not 50, but 100. That gives much better odds. We play the combination and win millions! Ka-ching! That would be enough. In yourdreams. Come on! Jerk. Ka-ching! Isn't itenough? How much are you missing? - Around 1000. Marianne? Today he's 1000 short, tomorrow 2000. - He has no idea how to save! - Yes, I do. Anyone wanta kebab? We have to do something, Thomas. How much are you short, right now? I'm short 500 kroner. Loch Get out. I see. I understand. But he's sitting here with two ferry tickets to Denmark. Yes, but this could be just what the two of you need. I'll tell him. He'll be pleased to hearthat. This isn't a permanent decision you have to make. Stay with us as long as you want. Or until you can move home. Rogerhasn't moved out, Thomas. - And it doesn't look likely. - He will move out! I hearyou, but we have to relate to the situation today. She has a job, she doesn't want him there anymore. She's doing fine. He's going to move out! I think that's enough. At least we have had a chance to meet. Think about it, Thomas. And we'll talk again in a few weeks. Lillian? I haven't seen herfordays. Have you quit? Work, mom! No. I just didn't feel up to it today. - What is this? - Can you call, tell them I'm sick? - What the hell is this? -It's nothing. - What is this? - Nothing. Honey... He has to go, mom. Now! - Don't you get it? - I can't. I need someone who loves me too. Loves you? You call this love, mom? You call this love? Thomas! - I want you to leave. - What? I want you to leave.

He doesn't answer. I thought she was OK with it. She was supposed to be working the night shi?. But suddenly she just came home. It neverhas worked between us. Like it helps to be related! Itdoesn't.
