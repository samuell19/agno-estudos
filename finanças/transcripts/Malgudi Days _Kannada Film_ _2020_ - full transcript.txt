To get respect one must be worthy of it. You are not. You were telling about dismiss.? I’ll only resign!. I don’t work in this company anymore. What? What nonsense are you talking Prakruthi? Think twice. You won’t get this job profile elsewhere. Nor you will get such a work atmosphere. That is true. Neither will I get an atmosphere like this, nor a shameless boss like you anywhere! Hey! Mind your language. What do you think we girls are? Guys, listen here! This third class boss of yours, It seems there is IT conference in Goa., and he invites me alone to go with him. In spite of my refusal, he has been harassing me since two weeks, to go with him. There are so many seniors in this office. and yet he wants me only to go with him. Look, You got me wrong. This is all rubbish you are ta… Shhh!!!…There is more. Last time he took Vinusha along for Delhi conference, harassed her there. She got scared and left the office Listen, she quit citing personal reasons. Look Mister, I have messages that you have sent me from a year ago `Let’s go to a resort' `Let us go on a long drive' `I can’t sleep, send me that type selfie' Listen carefully. I’m submitting my resignation My last two-month salary should be credited by today evening. If not ... I’ll put molestation case, and have you put behind the bars. Good bye for your job! And..and I have the screen shots of all the messages, which you sent to Vinusha and me, and I have forwarded to your wife, Have a good day. Stop! You should not get a job in any company.. I will make sure. Bloody bitch. We are still slogging here! Where did she got that courage from? Mostly it must be #Me Too affect. She loved my writing, loved me and married me. I stopped writing. She too left me! I used to tell her, `Saroja… … I will die before you.. because, I don't have the power to live without you.' But she only passed away first. But the truth is, if she would have been in my situation, she would not have the strength to endure this distress. Friend, Friend, Call me often, once you are in America. GOVT. HIGH SCHOOL MALGUDI Is he not a renowned litterateur now? I doubt if he will even remember us You needed us when we were in school, but you don't need us now, isn't it? “Flowers don’t talk.. When they bloom, everybody admires Water does not speak If it falls from atop, everybody rejoices The wind does not talk... I’m so sorry Are you fine? That’s okay Are you hurt? No..no You came suddenly, so I didn’t notice Doesn't matter You are fine, right? I’m alright. I should have been more careful. It was my fault. It was my fault too Don't worry, give me the bag. It is fine, it is okay. Should I drop you somewhere? No, I don’t want to trouble you. Please, I insist sir Ya, please I was heading towards Majestic Ya, sure. I’ll get this Okay, okay Sir, where are you off to this early? I don’t know Sorry? I have not decided yet. I have left home and come Why? Are your children not taking good care of you? Or is it Love case? Nothing like that Last week I lost my wife I’m alone at home My daughter and son-in-law have come from America They are insisting to go with them to America. I don't want to go to America. Since I’ll be forced to go with them if I stay there, I left home and came Mine too is a sort of similar story I was fed up of my boss and work issues I desperately needed a break So I borrowed my friend’s car and started out Where to? Same pinch, No clue Mostly towards Malnad region, I think.. Alone? Oh! You don’t know where are you going, isn't it? So if you have no objection, you too can come with me. I’ll also have company But you’ll have to sponsor our food I’ll take care of the fuel Okay, will give.. Anyway, you wanted to go towards Malnad.. Can we go to Malgudi? Malgudi? Yes, Malgudi, I was born there It’s been ages since I went there Now I’m feeling like going there So I asked, that's it. Okay Sir, until you introduced yourself, I didn’t realize you are the litterateur Lakshminarayana Malgudi That’s okay. Am I film hero, to recognize me at first sight? Aren't the writers also heros? This is very tasty It’s not too sugary.. It’s yummy I’m a foodie Especially if I get local delicacies, eat more.. Our work tensions, made us to forget eating. If Whatsapp and Facebook were edible, then you would eat till your stomach burst I suppose! Sir, we are youths, Should always be in trending.. It’s these trends that are making writers like us jobless! See there, everyone is busy reading messages, no one wants to read books! You know what sir, earlier we had to fall back on books and news for information Now you get everything in Google ! You get everything.. but for the people we have lost! But we can see what we have lost also, which is a kind of torturous Can we leave? I feel like watching the sunrise It’s been a while since I have seen one too. Let’s go When darkness recedes Amazement of earth twinkles The world looks new Bringing out the child in you It is re-birth to the lifeless heart Sunrise As if a town is beckoning you As if something is left behind The path is conducive The firstlight is colourful In the dew filled dawn Let moments blossom amidst memories Let the journey go on The air of the earthy scent touches gracefully.. A line of poems of past have become songs now I’m really sorry I don't like America.. I’ll be back in Bangalore in two days It’s not like that, Daddy You please leave Apologise on my behalf to the kids Those written stories have sought the town’s skies The hidden tears desire a space filled with love The tree that embraces the earth, is saying something, `Come what may, keep growing like this'.. Like the silence of the forest, turned into a song and brought the rain The way to the town is also inviting The tree that embraces the earth, is saying something, `Come what may, keep growing like this'.. As if a town is beckoning you As if something is left behind The path is conducive The firstlight is colourful In the dew filled dawn Let moments blossom* aye, aye.. - what? She is on a tour with some old man..! The picture says, ‘journey begins’ Phew, here we are, waste bodies.. could not impress a single girl..girl! It seems girls like old men more, what you say? In that case, let we also age faster! Sir, I have read a couple of your books `MARADA NERALU' (Shadow of the tree) is my favourite Oh! Really? At the end of the story, the daughter's agony, when she could not attend the last rites of her mother, the attachment of father and daughter, the way you described it.. had tears when I read it.. Sometimes imagination becomes reality As a writer, I also like that work of mine After reading that book, I wished I had a father too You mean, your father is no more, is it? My father passed away when I was in school A father’s love, daughter’s warmth, mother’s tenderness, wife’s concern… Only those who have experienced all these can realize the value of it What does your mother do? She is a homemaker Right now she is worried about only one thing The fact that I remain unmarried even at this age But I am telling, why get married at such a young age?? Certain things have to happen at certain times, only then will they be meaningful. More so in the case of girls, While working in the IT sector, did you like someone? Any proposals … Lots, but somehow I didn’t like.. I think this, Love, affection are all bullshit.. Which means, you loved and lost in love, and are now in the ‘I hate him’ mode!. My story too Writers, not only in writing stories, interested in hearing the stories too.. Tell me your story. I'll listen. We can pass the time till we reach Malgudi Oh! So my love story is your time pass, is it?? If it upsets you.. That’s okay, I’ll tell you.. I am born and brought up at Sringeri. Completed my BCA degree. Got a job in campus selection. That was in Puducherry I had never stepped out of Malnad region before. So I was very scared I, especially can’t forget the first day Why, what had happened? New people, new place, new language I was really scared That was when I saw Vijay for the first time If somebody asks a girl how her man should be, `like Vijay' would be the answer.

May be you have a new friend, so, you forgot the old friend, know? Vijay I never thought you can think so cheaply.. Thank You for everything, Good bye. We had break up on proposal day itself. After that I left Puducherry and moved to Bengaluru Ever since life has been good But that was the last time I spoke to him. This is hilarious Why? You have lost your love without any reason, that's why! See, without problems no relationship will strengthen We should learn to tactfully cop up with such issues Relationships and problems around them are like, jackfruit and the rough skin around it Just because the skin is tough and poky, is not the fruit tasty? What is it we want? Fruit its fragrance, its taste.. means.. Goodness..isn't it? Did he not try to reach out to you? He did several times I have not received calls I did feel like talking, but my conscience did not permit me. At times, We would have shared so many things with them who are close to our heart. But when situations have drawn us apart, and live, thinking them as our rivals, afterwards. In spite of all this, we will continue to have a soft corner for them. True sir.. Many a times I have felt that, it would be nice if I could share my happiness and sorrow with him. I feel, stirring your old memories.. curdled your emotions.. I have never shared this with anyone. I feel relieved sharing it with you. Hey, Bro! Where are you off to? Who is that man with you? He is Lakshminarayana Malgudi, a litterateur Met him on the way. I’ll tell you everything, after returning. Don’t ask me anything now. Why not? Tell me now itself. Bye, bye byeeeeeee! Sir, there must be strong reason for you not visiting your hometown so long. Reasons are many. In that age, I didn’t had the discretion what is right and what is wrong Apart from that, hiding my hometown, Bengaluru engulfed me Then what made you to think of seeing hometown now suddenly? Do you know, which is our life's paramount, and ever remembering chapter? Which ones? Our childhood. Our school days. For some time now, my Malgudi days memories, are haunting me.. The streets I walked around in, the school I went to, courtyard of the house where I grew up, childhood friends… I forgot all these for years, it seems.. It is my desire to see all these before I breathe last. Sir, Whatever we do, reach great heights, achieve a lot in life, our hometown, our childhood memories, Those feeling are irreplaceable; Super..

All of you sit down. Don't remeber yesterday's lesson. You only know, what you read and what you write.. World war II ends in 1945. After two years, that is, in 1947, India gets Independance. Ever since her truth came out, no one showed interest in talking to her She was always by herself This started pricking my conscience The desire to be with her grew even greater That is for the day. If anybody has any doubt, come to staff rooom. Not coming? Go on, i’ll be right behind you “Friendship is the coming together of two pure hearts. I will be a partner for all your ups and downs I am extending the hand for friendship Your reply? Oh, Tomorrow.. Lakshmi, recite the poem that you wrote yesterday. Title of the Poem is.. Mounada Maathu (Words of silence) “Flowers don’t talk.. When they bloom, everybody admires Water does not speak If it falls from atop, everybody rejoices. The wind does not talk …… Evening breeze relaxes our mind and body. Just like that You too don’t talk But you tell everything.. By your sharp look. Wow! That was very nice Lakshmi. Sit Lakshmi, The rain has ripened the heart The earth abounds with beauty, This friendship is sweet Even the silence speaks. The spattering sound of raindrops Is the sign of friendship with the sky The rain that brings hearts together is itself the scripture Like the sacred last birth.. I am blessed by this friendship Every word of yours sparkles like the raindrops and as honey close to heart, glittering like a blob For every moment of my life, You are my pal My heart will wait for you till the end Pour, you rain.. to slide the veil of mind Spring, you the waterfall to forget the tone of flute In every words written your happiness is supreme For this sweet friendship, even the musical notes falter The rain has ripened the heart The earth abounds with beauty, This friendship is sweet Even the silence speaks. I’m off to school Lineta, I have been to several temples But I would like to visit church once. I have never seen it. You will take me? Children, you will be leaving this school after two months. But don’t forget this school. We may have beaten you and scolded you, but all that was for your own good. You all are very bright kids. Plan your future well Whenever you remember this school, the doors of this school will be open for you always. Hey boy, you come this side Me? Yes, you, move to this side. Come fast Should have sent Lineta also.. keep quiet We want justice! Down! Down! Malgudi police Down with convertions We want justice! Down with Malgudi Police. Stop Conversion, Save Culture. Down with Malgudi Police. Stop it I say. Down with Malgudi Police. Why are you shouting? Conversions are taking place here. Instead of shouting, are you expecting us to welcome this with all the fanfare? For that, it is not to protest in front of the Police Station. Give a complaint of the converstion. We are here to enquire it. If protectors only turn perpetrators, whom will we complain against? Means.. You are the ones encouraging conversion Aye, Shut up. Mind your tounge. Whom are you talking to? Stop pretending Thomas. We know you are orchestrating the whole thing.. Aye, What did you say? We said what we have seen.. Are you using your daughter to convert an innocent Hindu boy in the pretext of love, and converting the innocent Hindus, to strenghthen your religion? Aye, Shut your mouth, dog This Khaki is to protect people. Not to do such nasty things. We have proof for this Thomas, to show your daughter took our boy to the Church, and the Father preaching to him.. ha..ha.. How cheap are you to use your daughter for this, and pretend like you know nothing? Is it tit for tat? We will kick you out of this town and hoist our flag. It will fly high in every nook and corner. What are you going to do? What I will do? What are looking at? Charge. Down with Malgudi Police. We will see you.. How dare that police guy hit us! He invited his own doom by doing so We need to make him aware of our might. The whole town should burn in this crossfire Let’s go Gururaj blew a small issue out of proportion He had hatred towards Sub Inspector (SI), But we became the scapegoats. A couple of these men went to the church and created a scene there In retaliation, the other community ransacked temple Even the SI was attacked Situation became tensed The entire town became victim to communal violence They blamed me for the entire thing and tried to kill me I had to leave town to save myself One small incident.. changed the entire dynamics of a town To save my life, I fled from my home town Reached Bangalore with someone’s help After a few days when I wrote a letter to my town, Ramanna replied, that my mother died worrying of me. What shall I do at the place where my mother is no more? I lived in an orphanage at Bangalore, completed my studies engaged in writing. My writings became popular. I became litterateur. And here I am today Sir, then how about your marriage, daughter.. How did that happen? Saroja, She was a big fan of all my writings. She became my wife. Means.. That is, She used to read all my books and write to me. I also used to reply. Then our familiarity turned into friendship Often, we used meet near Ganapati Temple at Basavanagudi. This friendship gradually turned into love We got married thn our daughter is born. At one stage I even stopped writing. She too left me.. You are very lucky Sir Not everybody gets their love. That too you married your fan! You are realy very lucky. That is true. Sir, one thing is clear What? You are not going to see Malugudi. Is it not to see Lineta? I know. If I wanted to see Lineta, I would have gone long back. Sir, we are any way going to Malgudi, Lineta also will be there. Shall we meet? Oh, no, no.. No. I have no courage to meet her again. Nor I am worthy of it. Lineta is the nectar chapter of my life. I don't want to continue that chapter again. Sir, whatever you say, first crush is always beautiful Whenever we think of them, it makes us happy That's why it is called love. Sir, we have arrived in Malgudi Have we arrived so soon? yes. See bro, SI’s daughter She is SI's Daughter. Is he not our Girijamma's son? What is he doing in church? They go to the same school. He may have gone to see the church. No one goes just like that. Then? These Christian girls under the pretext of loving Hindu boys, take them to church and convert them. Aye, there is nothing like conversion and all.. I too know that. But, to drive away Thomas from this town, we won't get another weapon, stronger than this. Aye, go.. get the boys ready Okay Bro.. Down with conversion. This is very ground where I playing.. Everything has changed Sir, we are in Malgudi. Next? I feel like visiting my school School? Okay let's go. I used to climb this flag post up on, Independence Day, Rajyotsava, Republic day or any other days, hoist the flag, and climb down the pole with great speed. All the students used to watch me intently. Because I was the only one doing this in the whole school. Oh, nice I used to sit here Linetta, used to sit on that bench Lakshmi, where were you all these years? Do you know from how many years I have been waiting for you? And you are coming now! Is he not a great litterateur today? How would he remember us! In school you wanted us.. Now you don’t need us, do you? After all we are village folks, you know? He is city dweller today. If he takes the names Village, friends, won't his worth go down? Lakshminarayana Lakshminarayana Lineta One minute, one minute Do you see a broken statue there? There is a big story behind that What is it? Sir, how many such stories do you have? Oh, I will tell you along the way. Shall we go? SIr, next? I feel like going to school again. If that could be done, everybody would be going back to school. I asked, where to go next? This is where Ramanna’s hotel was. I don’t know if it is still theirs. Aye, Lakshmu! Ramanna, Ramanna It has been years since I have seen you! After leaving this town, I am seeing you today only! I am so happy to see you. Come here, come sit How have you been dude? - I am good What Ramanna, hotel has changed so much? How are you? I am just the same. After my father’s death, I had to take charge of the hotel. By the way, Malgudi is not what it used to be. It has changed a lot. When town is changed, the hotel also had to change know? Finally you came to Malgudi.! I am so happy. Whenever you are seen in media, I tell my customers, that `we were childhood pals'. I am very happy. By the way, who is this? Thisi is my daughter, Prakruthi. Is it? Hello. What do you do? I am an IT analyst, sir I do not understand all this IT, BT Even I have not understood it. My children are also in Bangalore. They too are in the IT, BT. Oh, is it? They earn well and are well settled. They come here once a year. For that, can we give up our traditional occupation? What happened to Gururaj who created the entire ruckus? He was jailed after that disturbance. Oho! But once he came out of jail he was given MLA ticket, just because he was Jail-returned! It was even thought that, he would become MLA. But, when he was going home in the night, four persons hacked him to death Good that it happened. That SI? After that incident he was transferred to somewhere. That was the last we heard of him. Did not Linneta tell you anything? No, No.. After I went to Bengaluru everything changed. I was not in touch with Lineta. What about our Santu? He is settled in Delhi. He is doing very well He came here three years before. Whenever he finds time, he calls Didn't you go near your house? No, now that I am here, I will go But what is there to see, Ramanna? Yes. After your mother’s death, house was ruined. people looted the house, and took away whatever they got. Okay Ramanna, I will leave now. How can you go without having a cup of tea, from my hotel? `Two tea.' No, no, I have some work to attend. I will do this, Before I leave, I will definitely visit you again You should come.. - Definitely. I will take leave.. - Okay.. Let's go.. Bye, uncle For one last time, I feel like seeing my mother Is your mother still there? In the memories of my home, my mother is immortal. Sowing the light of confidence Riding the dream horse Passing the cross road, Climbing the mountain Reaching the peak fast With the smile of success The entire world underneath my feet Mom, it is only your memory that is in the mind The silence within me The prayer in my breath You are my courage The shadow of valour You are light that brightens the world, Mom Krishna is not God to Devaki Rama is not God to Kausalya The mother who gave birth to God, Isn’t she a Goddess herself? I will seek another childhood and be a kid in your warm lap, Mom, Mom, I will be the smile in your life My mother, my mother is the God that guards my world You are my life, You are my conscious You are my courage The shadow of valour You are light that brightens the world, Mom I lost my mother. I forgot my roots. I am a sinner. Being a writer, why did I disassociate myself from my people? Please console yourself Sir. Mom.. There is a store here. I will go get a bottle of water. One minute Thank you. Hey, Prakruti Hi, Avi! What a surprise! What are you doing here? This is my hometown, I have settled down here now But you were working in Bengaluru, that one? I quit that job, came back and am now happily pursuing agriculture. What brings you here? I had some work, so I came with Sir. Which sir? Lakshminarayana Malgudi, a litterateur Oh, my wife is a great fan of his; will you introduce me to him? I’ll do that Come You stay in Basavanagudi is it? When I came to Bengaluru, I didn't had your contact.. So I could not meet you. Is it? Sir, sir.... Greetings Sir, This is my friend Avinash. We were collegemates Ohhh Please sit sir, Sir, my wife is a great fan of yours, she must have read all your books. Is it? Sir, you are in our town; if you come to our house, and have a cup of tea, we will be so happy. We are hard-pressed for time, we have to leave now .

Prakruti at least you tell... - Avi, listen Sir, you don’t have to tell her anything , I insist, you are coming coming to our home. Prakruthi get into the car, you are coming that’s it - Okay fine, we will come Please listen to me.. - Follow my two wheeler. I’ll be near that shop, bring the car there. Please come in sir. Sri.. I am coming, Avi. This place is so peaceful in the midst of nature, very peaceful, isn't it?

Sri, come soon, why are you taking this long? - what Avi? Surprise.! Sir, sir is that really you? Hello, Sir, please be seated sir That’s alright. Sir, I cannot trust my own eyes, Actually, I am a big fan of yours sir. I have always been telling Avi , that I want to meet you at least once, I am so happy to see you sir Actually..... Prakruti right? Ya Sringeri Engineering College? Yes Friends..? Hi.. - Hi. Shreeja - Nice meeting you Sri, prepare something special Anything will do, why trouble yourself too much? Sir, this is no trouble, you please keep quiet. What shall I prepare Avi? Prakruthi likes, unde kadubu (a dish), prepare that. you keep talking, I will prepare that and be back soon You remember? Of course.. Walk slowly So, what do you do Avinash? After completing my engineering course, I was trying for a job. I didn't want to work day and night, as data entry person in any company, like a slave. I was interested in agriculture, so I decided to pursue it. Oh, what do you grow? This field was in ruined state, as nobody was there to plough it I got it from its owner, and started growing paddy. We give some share of whatever we grow to the owner, the rest is for us. We also grow pepper and areca etc., As of now, 30 persons work here. We are doing well. Very good plan, excellent job! Beacause, whatever progress technology may , the food we eat must come from villages, and farmers should grow it. If this is understood properly, every farmer is an engineer. Is he not productive? Sri, shall I help you with? No I will do it, you go. Jaggery.. You go, I will take care of it Ask me if you need any help. I will come. I said leave. I got jaggery, I got jaggery Sir, you are back in Malgudi after so many years Wav, nice.. After listening to your story, I feel like seeing Lineta. What do you say Prakruti? Me too.. I must see her at least once You Naughty girl. Prakruti, let us go back to Bengaluru tomorrow as we had planned Linetta gave me fond memories to my life, no doubt, but it is good, if it is in memory only. I came here to see my town Malgudi, I saw it. If I go in search of Lineta now, after the death of his wife, at this age, won’t people laugh at me and saying Lakshminarayana is going in search of his childhood friend? Let anybody say anything, but we must see her We had actually thought of going back, but now it is cancelled. We will stay back. Good idea, you stay here until she is found. No problem. Mine is also the same opinion. We will make all arrangements for you here. you just stay here Any day first love is the best love. What did you say? First love is the best love. First love is best love? Is it not sir? Shall I talk about it? Let it go I will tell - I said no Let me tell.. What is it? Sir, actually these two are not just friends. Avi was in love with prakruthi when they were in college. Is that so? Actually that..... Don't worry, Avi has told me everything Actually I was loving her a lot, but I didn’t had the guts to tell her. But finally I made up my mind, proposed to her on the Farewell Day. But she rejected a good boy like me. It is not like that, I did not want to commit so early Thanks for rejecting him. Otherwise, I would have never found a good guy like Avi. He is really good guy. What is the use of saying that now? My wife is a Ph.D. in preparing `unde kadubu' (Lumpy pudding) and `akki rotti' ( rice bread) taste it and you will know it. Our Malnad savories' taste is wonderful. Do you know one more thing sir? Whenever we have fights, I always tell her, I will divorce you, Prakruthi is waiting for me, Oh, I am waiting for you, come..!! You like `unde kadubu', right?, Eat, my wife has prepared it. Serve yourselves.. - I need one more “rotti” It is prepared by my wife, How many times will you say it’s your wife's preparation? It is very nice. Hey, I wanted to tell you yesterday itself, your car is super. It is my friend’s Do you want to drive it? You used to come to college in this jeep right? Yes, the same jeep. I learnt driving in this jeep only. Is it? He only taught me. If I meet Lineta, I will first apologise to her. In case I meet her, will she talk to me? Do not worry Sir, Just wait and see how she will blush as she sees you. You are weaving good story. she will blush it seems! I told you that day only, he has been transferred immediately after that riot. So, they left this town overnight You better to enquire at Someshwara police station. Okay.. Sir, have you given her any gift? I had not given her anything, but she had gifted me a fountain pen. I had preserved it very carefully, I don't know where I lost it afterwards. But the memories of my time with her are gifts which cannot be lost. What’s with these tattoo? If you give any gift, it may be lost, may be forgotten, but this is permanent. What are you thinking about? Nothing. Thomas was S I here in this station, between 1975 and 1979. The records say that he was transferred to Moodbidri later. Beyond this, there is no other information. Why are you standing? As there is no chair to sit! Okay, stand, this government digs good roads for white topping In our office, if there is a table, there is no chair or vice versa. I was requesting for furniture repeatedly. I am fed up of working here! Sir, key. Did you drop my daughter to school? - Yes sir Sir, your wife asked you, to get 2 Kg. onion and one Kg drumstick on the way back home. Yesterday only I had brought 2 Kg Drumstick, brought 2 Kg onion.. how can it get over so soon? How would I know your family secrets, sir? See, one Kg. drumstick costs 55 Ruppes, 1 Kg. tomato 40 Rupees, I kg. onion 20Rupees, A bundle of coriander leaves 25 Rupees. How can we make both ends meet, if this is the situation? How can we live with this price rise? No, no, no.. No chance.. Can you please call the Moodbidri police station and enquire about SI Thomas? The present SI Shankar is my friend, I will call him right now. Hello Shankar, how are you? I need an information. In 1979, from our Someshwar station, an SI named Thomas was transferred to Moodbididri. Please find his whereabouts and text me. I have been repeatedly asking for a transfer from this station, they are not transferring. If I ask them, they say, reduce your weught by 10 Kg, we will transfer you to the station of your choice. You only tell me, at this age, can I reduce my weight? It is not possible sir, you surely can't! You said it. Yes, yes. Ohhhho... SI Thomas was transferred from Moodbidri to Hosanagara. He has only this information, he says. If you go there and enquire, you may get information. You were of great help. Thank you - We will take leave Rohan, Other than drumsticks and onions, what else, she has asked to bring? We are all but sailors in the boat of memories Sailing between one shore and another searching for the path we left behind After serving here, he was transferred to Malur. If you enquire there, you may know. by opening each and every page In the trap of illusion is it a haunting memory? In the river of emotion is it roaming memory? In the trap of illusion is it a haunting memory? In the trap of love is it the memory that haunt us? Beautiful.. life is beautiful.. even with little happiness Bond.. bond with everybody.. until we breath our last Hello.. Where are you? I am in my hometown. I have not used my car properly.. You have taken it for a day, but how many days now? When are you returning? I didn't here anything.. bye, bye. Searching those footprints you have left behind, you seek the bygone journey again We are all but sailors in the boat of memories Sailing between one shore and another Let us set out early in the morning tomorrow. By 9.30 we will be in Sringeri. No, somehow I don't feel like going.. We will return tomorrow itself.. We have searched so far, we will definitly find her. Let us try once tomorrow, Sir Okay. Let's try tomorrow also. But if we do not find her tomorrow, you should not force me again. Sir, we will definitely find her. Hey, what happened? Why are you dull? Nothing like that. I too am observing from afternoon.. she is thinking of something very deeply. We are travelling past two days, I am tired a bit. That's all. That’s not the case, Let me tell you. Avi, no, Avi, please, You keep quiet. I will tell - nothing like that.. Avinash, you tell us. Today is Vijay’s birthday Vijay who? Our madam’s `special someone’ Oh, Puducherry Vijay Why should you feel low over that? It is not that, Three years ago we broke up, That too was on his birthday. After that, we never spoke. We wish each other on our birthdays, that’s it. Let me tell you something by my experience. Those whom we love, will be with us only till we love them. Even if we do a small mistake, they disappear. But those who love us, will correct us, even if we have made several mistakes; and love us all the more. Whatever and whenever we are destined to get, we should. Once time passes away, that too slips from us. I am the best example for it. Call and speak to him, everything will turn out fine. He may have forgotten me, or he may have committed with some other girl. No, don’t. Impossible! If he really loves you, he will wait till you get married at least. Call him and say `sorry'. By asking `sorry' nobody becomes small. Isn't it? I don’t have courage. Tell Avi. You text him. you will definitely get reply. What if I do not get one? Take, text him. Do it. Type fast.. What you have to say is… - I’ll type All that she’ll know! Did you do it? One second, sent it? Just a second Is it sent? - Yes. Is it delivered? Must be delivered. Message is delivered. He has read it. All this happened because of you guys. If he does not come here.. I knew that you would be back in my life. But you should not have done that ya.. Actually, that day I came to propose to you Really? Really? I too came to propose What? That day, I had told my friend that I would propose. She kept texting me, asking what happened. I was just replying to her. I thought that you were chatting with somebody else, I thought you were not interested. Sorry, all these beacause of me. I didn't reply your calls. all this is my mistake. It is okay baba.. It’s okay, show me your hand. I am ready, shall we leave? What is this? Dressed up as if you are going to attend some function. We are going to Sringeri anyway, There is a ‘pooja’ at my home. So I thought I’ll introduce him to my mother. Oh! This means we will soon have, wedding banquet. On the way to Sringeri, get me a good tender coconut. - you forgot your mobile. Sir, I will get you the best one. - Thank you. Bye, Okay, we will get going now. Shall we have a selfie? When you say selfie, girls’ faces brighten up.. Mom, Finally you are here. How are you? I am good. How are you? - I am good This is my mother, my father, my whole world. Mom, this is Lakshminarayana Sir, I was telling you, know? Hello That is Avi, Avinash, my college friend. This is Vijay, my friend Hello aunty. Hello How many more days will you introduce him as your friend? Tell that he is your fiance. fiance? Not like that, I wanted to tell you. Mom, we were colleagues in an IT company. We became friends there. But you didn’t tell me all this? Now, the boy and girl like each other.. This is not the time to worry about caste, horoscope etc., without making them to give up, get them married as soon as possible. I have never objected any of her desires. Since she has chosen him, there can not be a better choice. But still, you should have told me. Don’t get into drama mode now! Bring your family members once. Okay. We will all sit together and discuss. - Okay In fact, today's Pooja is, for the blessings of almighty to get her married soon. See, the result has come even before the ‘pooja’ begins, So why delay? Come.. Puja begins. Enough. Holige’ (pancake) and ghee - beautiful combination Yes. you must have one more, That’s why finish it fast. Why just one, let me have two more.. When you come next time, stay at least for a week Not just for a week, I will stay over for a month. Prakruti, I’ll head back to Bengaluru. We will meet once you are there. Mom, when I come next, I will bring my family members along. Will do - Okay, Bye Bye, Sir bye. aye, let be good. We will also take leave. let be good.. - Bye. Sir, if you have a photo of Linneta, we would like to see How? We didn’t had mobile phones then, to preserve our memories You generation is far better. You meet through Facebook, Whatsapp, Groups, whenever you feel like You will stay connected. No sir, We too remember our school and college friends But won't meet. there will be messages saying `Will meet in Whatsapp group, let's have reunion' But nobody will meet. It is not that Prakruthi. When in college, only our classmates are our friends but once we step out in to the real world, our circle widens Our responsibilities also increase, If one finds time, others do not. Especially girls will have excuses like, `must drop my child to school', `husband didn't permit me' `my mother-in-law is sick' like things.. Not that sort. We too will have more responsibilities, once we are married. Mother in law, Father in law, husband, his family, their functions, That itself is a different world. By the way, after our college days, you are meeting today.! Did you call, or texted? You never remebered us. Hey, I am a married person now! So? One minute. this is a never ending argument. Friendship, Love are two great epics of the world These two elements are the inspiration for all great stories As per our stayion records, he served in this station, till his retirement. Then he settled in Madikeri, people say. Afterwards, I don't know sir. Okay, we will take leave. It is not Malgudi that you want to see, it’s Lineta! Isn't it? After listening to your story, I feel, I should meet Lineta No, we will go back, there is no point in searching for her. Lineta.. I am leaving, I am leaving this town.. If I continue to stay here, they will kill me. I do not want to die, I want to live.. I will leave now. No, no, I am not leaving you; I will not go, leaving you. I’ll be back in 2-3 days, whereever I go. I will be back. I will come back for you. I promise by you Lineta. You will wait for me, till I come, is it? I will come Lineta.. I will definitely come will definitely come Lineta, I will definitely come It is true that I wanted to see her and apologise for my mistakes. But even after searching fso much, we failed to trace her means, she can not be traced. We will leave Avinash.. Your garden is really beautiful. I felt very happy. Thank you, it is just a hobby. This house, atmosphere, your hospitality.. - Will you teach me too? everything made me very happy - Sure We will take leave of you. It’s our duty sir. Next time when you come to Malgudi, you must come to our home to stay Sure. Prakruti, if you do not invite me for your marriage, I will kill you! Both of you must come a week ahead. Why a week, we will come a month in advance. Oh, Hello sir Hello, Hello, Mr Lakshminarayana, - Hello I am the head master of Malgudi school Oh! Hello.. I knew that you are in town, so I came to meet you So glad.. I had actually come to the school. I came to know, peon told me Tomorrow afternoon we are celebrating our school day. Nice. It is the school where you have studied. You are in town.. On behalf of the School, we want to felicitate you. No, no please. I am not a person who desires such things.. Sir, let’s go. School day, children, atmosphere .. everything will be great fun. But we have to go back to Bengaluru now Sir, apart from that, the person felicitating you is very special. Special guest to felicitate.. who could that be? Some old man it seems, he has a flashback it seems, they are searching it.. how stupid are they? phew, to hell with us. Even that old man has a flashback! we are just sitting here doing nothing.. Rita, want to join me for coffee? you will get till my chappal tears.. I can’t pay for that. Will pay only for coffee. Dude, chappal costs 500 bugs. That is why, we are sitting like this. What dude? On behalf of the people of Malgudi, we are felicitating a litterateur today. Another special person, who felicitates him was, guide and was light of Lakshminayana's life. Madam, please come. Saraswati teacher, she was Lakshminarayana Malgudi’s teacher , and inspiration to all his writings. Today, this stage has witnessed a rare reunion. I have now realized I have fogotten my town, my school, my people.. If I had not come back here, my life would have been a waste. Today if I have written something, our Saraswati teacher is behind it. I am reminded of a poem on this occasion. In the book of thousand memories Memory of childhood being the first line Book is spread with childhood mischiefs Falling, getting up, running, studying.. Those memories of being back again, Another childhood has to return again.. to complete the mischief that was balance to learn, to teach But can childhood be back again? Time has gone past us. only remembrance in front of us Jai Kannada. Cultural programmes will commence now. First up is a folk dance that mirrors the culture of Malnad, by 8th standard students When others spoke high about you, I was feeling proud, you know? I am so glad you came back. By the way, what is Lineta up to? Look how he is blushing. blushing? Yes, you are. Why would I? We searched a lot madam, but we could not find her anywhere. That story is over. I am very happy to be back here. More than anything, I’m happy that I got to meet you. Sir, shall we capture this moment in a selfie? Aarti, a 9th standard student, will now sing the song `Kaanada Kadalige hambaliside Maana' Sometimes in the pages we don't mind reading itself , there will be the answeres we search for Hello, Hello, am I talking to Prakruti? Yes.. Are you looking for Lineta? Yes. May I know who you are? I’m Shruti, daughter of Lakshminarayana Malgudi’s school friend, Vimala. My friend had shared the post you had uploaded on face book. I saw that and called you. Nice, tell me. Actually Lineta is alive. Really? Where is she? She is in Malgudi only. Lineta is in Malgudi only it seems Lineta is in Malgudi? Yes. But we have looked around everywhere. Someone must be fooling around with you. You please tell me, where is she in Malgudi? I will send you the address. Thank You. Thank You so much. I kept telling you right that we will surely meet her It seems, she is in Malgudi only. Who told you that? Your friend Vimala’s daughter told me. Shall we go now? Okay fine, turn the vehicle. Vimala? Prakruti? Yes, I was the one who called you. Hi.. -Hi.. Lakshmi.. how are you? I’m sorry, I can’t place you Vimala.. Malgudi school? Oh! yes. Where is Lineta? She is inside. Li, Li, Lineta, Lineta, look here, It’s me Lakshminarayana I, your Lakshmi is here. Your Lakshmi. I know that you are angry with me I am distressed by the fact that I did not think of you all these years Lineta, I have wronged you I told you that I would come back to meet you, but I never did. I could not come. I am a sinner. I made you wait this long. Open your eyes and see me once Lineta, See your Lakshmi once Lineta and I, studied together in PUC and degree. We two were very close friends. When we were in final year degree, ignoring her protests, her father, got her married to a soldier from Madikeri, as it was a good alliance. Her bad luck, within a month of their marriage, her husband died in the war. She was very upset. Till her father was alive, she was in Madikeri. Then, You know, what did she told me? `Take me to Malgudi.. Lakshmi will come there searching for me.. I want to see him!' she insisted to do so. Her last desire was to meet you. It is ten years, she has not recognised anybody. You should have somehow tried to contact me and informed me. I did consider that, But she said, `Lakshmi will remember me on his own.. He will surely come looking for me someday if he loves me' And here you are finally as she wished. If she was conscious she would have been the happiest.. As if the tears rolling down your cheeks are waiting for the finger The first silent words Are searching for the shore I beg your pardon In rebirth I will be born as your friend, we will meet, forgive me for everything Like the pen that wrote a story forgetting the very first line Fond memories have almost faded away Death comes flowing like a stream The forgotten breath seems to say something Let the final line be I will meet you again As if the tears rolling down your cheeks are waiting for the finger The last silent words I will meet you again.. Lineta, Memories are like old clothes. They may be old now. But they were new once. This may not be just the story of Lakshminarayana Malgudi's memories It could be your story too. This could be your childhood story , The story of your town, It's just that in Lineta's place, somebody else may be waiting.. Instead of Lakshmi, somebody else will be searching.. Look around once.. real love and affection is all around you .. Don't forget those who have you loved you
