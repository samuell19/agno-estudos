TO JOSÉ MARÍA RIBA -You did everything I said? -Yes, tutor. Tossed your phone? -Yes. -Get in. Echo! Echo... I'm scared of dogs. Connie. Come here, sweetie. Come on, let's go. -Hi. -Hi. Adela, Irene. -Welcome. -Thanks. THE DAUGHTER I'd never had a room so big. Towels and clean clothes are in the closet. Thanks. Irene. JUVENILE DETENTION CENTER Did you hear my message? I called you several times. No, I was driving. -Irene ran away. -What? She went out yesterday and hasn't come back. -She hasn't contacted you? -No. I called her mother but she's not there. She might be hiding her. No, Javi. She was angry. She says she's with Osman. Osman is in jail. I know, I told her, but... she says we're bastards for letting her out. Right. So what do we do? I don't know, I'd wait. Have you talked to the police? Not yet. We have to report it. Do you want to go? Okay. Hello. Come in. Miguel. Hey, Javier. How are you? -Better, much better. -You look good. My daughter says I look like a monk. Well, who cares about hair. I didn't know my eyebrows would fall out too. -And your people? -Mobilized. A girl ran away, right? Yeah. Irene, 14 years old. Do I know her? I don't think so, she's only been at the center 7 months and you were on leave. -Give me her last name. -Díaz Guillot. Irene Díaz Guillot. One year detention for inter-family violence. -Her mother's an addict. -Have you talked to her? Silvia called her but she says she doesn't know where she is. The girl is three months pregnant. -Who's the father? -Osman. Damn, what a piece of work. He's in jail, right? -Robbery by force. -Do you know where she might be? No. Several of her friends have gotten out lately. One is in Bilbao, another in Jerez... She might just come back in a couple of days. Living so far away doesn't scare you? Why would I be scared? Of being alone. I'm not alone. I have Javier, the dogs... This whole place which is beautiful. Can we go down into town? No. Nobody can know you're here, Irene. I have to see Osman. -Osman? -He's the father. Osman is in jail. I have to talk to him. Talk about what? To tell him everything and tell him that I'm okay. You can't go anywhere. It's too dangerous. There's no internet here and I threw away my cell phone. I have to tell him. Do you want to go back to the center? There's still time. I didn't say that. We're risking a lot, Irene. If you don't want to do it you have to say so. All right. I'll talk to Javier when he gets back. I dreamed about her last night. Her? It's going to be a girl. What's wrong? This isn't going to work out, Javier. She's just a girl. She has no idea what she wants. She says she wants to see Osman. I told her she can't see anyone. Well, that's what she says. If she isn't sure, I don't want to go forward. Where is she? In her bedroom. -Yes? -It's Javier. Hi. Hi. What are you drawing? Nothing. May I? -They're very pretty. -Thanks. Adela says you want to see Osman. I have to see him. Or at least talk to him. So he knows that I'm okay. Today I had to go to the police to report you. Do you understand what that means? That by not showing up you violated your sentence and they're going to look for you. If you try to contact Osman, they'll know where you are. And we won't be able to help you. I just want him to know I'm okay. Yeah, but if you're going to stay here, that can't happen. All right. If you want, I'll take you into town tonight. I'll help you find somewhere and call Osman. But you won't be able to stay here anymore. I don't want to be alone. I don't want to lose you. Then you can't contact Osman. You have to wait until you have the baby. After, when we've fixed everything, you can do whatever you want. Go with him, stay with us. Whatever you want. We'll help you no matter what you decide. But first you must have the baby. And for that no one can know where you are. Okay. I want to thank you for everything you're doing for me. There's no need, Irene. I want to stay with you and have the baby, ma'am. Please don't call me ma'am. Irene! Irene? I fell asleep. I'll change and make dinner. Can you knock next time? Want some help? With this you really look pregnant. Where's Javier? He took the dogs out. What's going on? Irene, are you crazy? Those are guns. Do you know how to shoot? Will you teach me? Irene, you're pregnant. Guns are not for playing around. Please... -Please. -It's late, go to bed. Good night. Good night. Good night. What's wrong? Nothing. Where are you going? See if you can now. That's too far away. Okay, get out of the way. -What? -Nothing. Nothing what? You shut me up. Oh, I shut you up. Am I good or what? Not bad. I'm very good. Thank you so much. -I had a great time. -Me too. Adela, I know these kids well. If you don't play their game, they don't listen to you. Javi! Javi! A car. What do you mean, a car? Irene, take care of Irene. Irene. Please. Get away from the window. A traveling salesman? The man picked her up on the road and dropped her off 4 miles away from here. He says she was pregnant. It makes no sense. What would she be doing around here? She was at the gas station. That's from two weeks ago. I don't understand. We checked all the brothels in the area, just in case, -but there's no sign of her. -The brothels? In case she fell into human trafficking. Oh, my God. But it's not logical. If she did, they would have taken her far away. -I made coffee. -You shouldn't have -bothered, ma'am. -It's no bother. Thank you. As far as we know, you're the only person Irene knows in the area. Most of the inmates know where I live. I talk to them about what I do, my life in the country, walking the dogs... Maybe that's it, that she's looking for you. Are you okay? Miguel, are you okay? -Can I use the bathroom? -Of course. It's the second door. I'm sorry. You shouldn't be working, Miguel. It's nothing, effects of the treatment. This takes time. Where were we? Oh, yes. She might be looking for you. Why would she want to do that? Maybe her plans went wrong and she's afraid to go back to the center. Wouldn't she try to contact her mother? We put her mother under surveillance in case she calls her, but I don't think she will. -Why not? -Her mother is an addict and psychotic. She's done nothing but abuse the girl her whole life. But she's her mother. If she knows your wife is also pregnant she might think that you two would help her. She can't know. Why? Because we found out about our pregnancy after she left the center. Adela... What have you done? Liar... You're a fucking liar. You left the house, you were in the area and you've put us all in danger. I only went for a walk. Don't lie to me. -Adela... -Shut up! What have you been doing? I felt overwhelmed from being here. I only left for a little while. -I needed to get out. -Don't lie to me. I wanted to call Osman, but I didn't, I swear. I didn't do it in the end. -Stupid bitch! -Adela... That's enough, that's enough. That's enough. Do you realize what you've done, Irene? You've put us all in danger. If they find out you're here, they'll put us in jail and give the baby to Social Services. Do you realize? -I'm sorry. -There, there. There, there. It's okay. I promise it won't happen again. Sit down. Hello, Javier. Hi. -Have you had dinner? -I'm not hungry. Is everything okay? Yeah. What are you watching? A show. What's it about? Finding matches for people. And after that? After that... If it works out, great, and if it doesn't, great too. Do you want some milk? What's wrong? Osman got out of jail. He came to the center looking for Irene. What did you tell him? That I don't know where she is. It's okay. The kid is brainless. Now he's looking for Irene, tomorrow who fucking knows. As soon as he gets in trouble he'll forget about her. -What if he doesn't? -He will. May I? Sit down, kid. Want me to make up a report and send you back to jail? Sit down and drink your coffee. Why did you go to see Javier, the tutor? -Ask him. -I'm asking you. I have a pregnant teenager missing for months who suddenly appears at a gas station near where Javier lives... What? On the mountain. Then you get out of jail and the first thing you do is go to see Javier. -So I'm wondering. -What? If Irene is using Javier to communicate with you, for example. Who told you that? Told me what? That Irene was in the area where the tutor lives. That's Irene, right? Did he tell you where she is? He doesn't know anything. Osman, I only want to help you. Irene is pregnant and she needs to go back to the center. Things can be managed from there. I don't know where she is. Can I go now? Irene. Irene, it's almost eleven, get up. You need to have breakfast. And your job? Starting today I'm staying home. I'm not working again until you have the baby. Get up. And Adela? She went into town. I'm glad you're here. Me too. You and Adela are so different. I don't really like her. You should have married someone who can have kids. I'm going to pretend you never said that. Never say it again. Okay. But it's the truth. Adela is not okay. Why are the dogs loose? I feel like they're watching me. They are watching you. Why? Because you lied to us, Irene. What if I wanted to leave now? The police would catch you. Yeah... And what if I don't care? Why would you not care? Because I'm sick of being here. When you have the baby you can leave. We'll give you enough money to be comfortable. What if when I leave Osman is with someone else? Osman loves you. What if he changes his mind? People change all the time, even I can change. What do you mean? Yes? Yes. If you make a gesture that gives away what we're talking about, I'll turn around and leave. Got it? If you really want to see Irene, do exactly what I say, all right? -All right. -Nobody here knows anything. So wait until I go inside, then leave 15 or 20 minutes after. Toss your cell phone and no electronic devices. And everything will be fine, okay? Give me a hug. He's still there. He'll leave eventually. He was acting crazy. He would only talk to you. That's why I called you. What did you tell him? The truth. That I haven't heard from Irene. We should call the police. If you do they'll arrest him again. He's just looking for his girl, it's normal. If someone comes, tell them you're on an excursion. There's a chimney and firewood. I'll see you tomorrow. Are you sure it's the best solution? They only want to see each other. I'll have Irene explain everything to him. Irene. Hi. -I'd like to talk to you. -What is it? I talked to Osman. He got out of jail and he wants to see you. Thank you. They'll take good care of the baby. The tutor and I talked and that's what we decided. When she has the baby we'll give you money so you can go anywhere you want. But until then Irene has to stay with us. And then what? Then you two can decide. If you want to visit us sometime, or see the baby... We have no problem with that. It's going to be a girl. She'll be your little sister. She's our daughter. Can I talk to Osman alone for a moment? Irene, we've risked a lot to help you. We don't want any trouble. All right. Adela. We talked it over and we've decided we want to keep the baby. We want to be together and take care of it. Have a family. Irene, that makes no sense. We've talked about this. What doesn't make sense? You two are too young. You can't take care of it. If Social Services finds out, they'll take the baby. Why would they find out? Because Irene ran away. You helped her. Both of you. You won't tell the police you kidnapped a minor. We didn't kidnap anyone. Osman didn't mean that. We're very grateful for everything you've done. But it's our baby and we want to take care of it. Irene can't leave. What? You can't leave. Of course I can. She's my daughter. -No, she's not! -Adela... Let's be reasonable. Where will you go? What will you live on? I don't know. We'll see. What do you mean, "we'll see"? It's a baby. You know what a baby is? What matters is we're together. She's scared of the dogs. They're harmless. You have half an hour to pack your things. Then I'll leave you two in town. You're not going to do anything? Do what? She's our daughter. Adela... You swore this would work out. You swore. -Do you know how to drive? -Sure. I have a friend with a car. It's old, but it'll get you out of here. We can go and pick it up. I'm almost ready. Finish packing your things. Adela will give you what we had for the baby. We'll be right back. And Irene? Asleep. She got nervous waiting for you so I gave her some tea and a pill. Osman left. It's for the best. Good morning. Breakfast. How are you? Fine. First take the pills. You're going to kill me, aren't you? What? After I have the baby. You're going to kill me, right? How can you say that? It's what you did to Osman. Osman left, Irene. Javier already explained. He didn't love you. It wasn't real love. He was only after our money. And why are you keeping me locked up here? To protect the baby. Because you don't believe us. You're capable of anything. You're both sick in the head. We're helping you, Irene. Helping? The baby. She's not your baby. I'm her mother. No, sweetie. You're carrying her inside you. That's not being a mother. Smoking? I started again. Since when? Don't stay out here too long, sweetheart. It's too cold. One of these days it's going to snow. Have you finished dinner? I'm not hungry. Adela asked me to check your blood pressure. I don't understand how you can like this show so much. 15/9... It's a bit high. Are you sleeping well? If there's a problem you have to tell us. We can't put the baby in danger. Do you want a pill to sleep? Why are you doing this, tutor? Your wife is crazy, but you? You talk without knowing. You're not like her. You don't want to do this. You're very young, Irene. You can have as many kids as you want. Is that how she convinced you? Nobody convinced me. It was my idea. You were going to have an abortion or they'd take it away because you're incapable of taking care of it. And that was unfair. We've been trying to have a baby for years. It's my baby. No. -You didn't want it. -Yes, I did. No, that's not true. I convinced you to have it. You had no idea what you wanted, you never have. I've been working with kids like you for 20 years. And all that for what? You have no right. I have every right. Irene, every right. Adela is devastated and I love her. But not like you love Osman. Because you don't understand this kind of love. What don't I understand? Come on, eat. I don't want to. You have to eat. Where's the spoon? What's the spoon doing here? The puree was cold. I got angry and threw it away. Do that again and you'll eat with your hands. I'm thinking of going back to work. When the baby is one or two years old. Get my life back. I think that's great. Me getting it back? You thinking about yourself again. Hello? Is anyone there? What are you doing? I heard a noise. What? A noise upstairs. I knocked and no one answered. I was walking the dogs. And your wife? She's inside. I've been knocking for a while. She must not have heard you. What's going on here, Javier? What are you talking about? There's a noise. It must be Adela, I already told you. Irene is inside, isn't she? Hi. The detective has been knocking for a while. I was in the bathroom. I didn't hear, I'm sorry. Can I come in and inspect the house? Do you have a warrant? You're going to ask me for a warrant? If you want to inspect my house, you need a warrant. Let him go in if he wants. He's accusing us of having Irene in the house. That's a crime. I'm asking you as a friend. If you were my friend, you wouldn't ask that of me. Would you rather I go and see the judge? What will you say? That you want to search my house because you heard a noise with my wife inside? You'll really tell the judge that? All right. By the way, I have something for you. I didn't know if it's a boy or a girl. Thank you. They found Osman's body. He fell off a cliff. -Where? -In the Zumeta River canyon. Osman said that you told him she was seen in the area. Maybe he was looking for her. Maybe. You're really not going to let me in? -No. -Javi, let him go in. It looks like we're hiding something. Satisfied? I gave her a shot. She'll sleep for a few hours. Harder, harder! You're doing great. Good, good, good... Good, good... Harder, harder... Harder, there she is! She's here, she's here! Here she is, here she is. She's here! She's here... She's here. It's over. Relax. It's over. She's my daughter. Burning saints, sound of sabers. Your pond no longer returns the reflection. Where is my baby? You have to eat. Your body needs to recover. I want to see my baby. I have to feed it. There's no need, we already have. But I want to do it myself. The birth left you very weak, Irene. You've been sleeping all day. Please. It's better if you don't. Please, let me see her. You have to sleep. I don't want to. -You need to sleep. -No. Irene... Let me see her. Let me. I got your ticket to Barcelona. You'll leave tomorrow with the baby. I'll come and join you later. When? When I fix everything. It will be like nothing happened. We're taking a trip, Andrea. Irene... Irene what have you done? Burning saints, sound of sabers. Your pond no longer returns the reflection. Everyone to the nest, the mothers chirp. Night is coming and it's hungry. Burning saints, sound of sabers. Your pond no longer returns the reflection. Everyone to the nest, the mothers chirp. Night is coming and it's hungry. ...about your bitter fate. About our long winter when I can no longer embrace you. Get the baby's things. -What are you doing? Where is Javier? -Didn't you hear me? Where will you go? That doesn't concern you. Do you know how to drive? Get the baby bottles. The dogs are loose. They won't let you leave. You'll come out with me. No. Stay! Stay back. Stop. Irene... What you're doing is stupid. Don't move! Irene, put down the gun. Irene, put down the gun. Put down the gun. Burning saints, sound of sabers. Your pond no longer returns the reflection. Everyone to the nest, the mothers chirp. Night is coming and it's hungry. Queen of the Trenches, what does anyone know about your bitter fate? About our long winter when I can no longer embrace you. Salt in the fields, blood in the mud. Beasts with the eyes of a frightened man. It can't wound you, it won't hurt you. As long as you keep the fire by your side. Queen of the Trenches, what does anyone know? What does the frozen wind know about how to rock you? There will only be a long winter if I can no longer embrace you. If I can no longer embrace you.
