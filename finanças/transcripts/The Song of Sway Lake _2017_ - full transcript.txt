But did you know that Sway Lake is a real place, where now anyone can visit? Even you!

The original "Sway Lake" record, performed and painted shut by Tweed McKay himself, on our wedding night... Never to be heard again. - The cheesy hit version was done by the Eden Sisters. In '44. Got rich bleaching other people's songs for the masses. - I cannot wait to hear the original version. - Nah, we can't open the record. It'll lose its value. We take it and run. - Ollie believes his father would've wanted him to have it.

I'm so sorry about your dad. - You were missed at the funeral. - What are you doing here? Put some clothes on, dude. - I'm speaking at town hall about that dreadful marina, tying up some loose ends.

Hal rescued Marlena from Cuba. - He tried desperately to get her kids out too. - Hey dad, I met a girl. What song should I play her? - What do ugly fellas like us know about love? Better to leave it untouched. I marked it five out of five for you. - How can you rate a record without hearing it? Dad? - Leave. - These are 78s? - No, those are 33s. These are 78s, heavy ones. Vinyl used to be industrial grade. Could slice a head off with a 78. - Why'd your pop hide it? - He didn't want his mother to have it. I heard she played the Victor recording of America the Beautiful at the funeral. If 50 years of nagging hadn't driven him to suicide, that shit would've killed him for sure. Found my dad's porn.

Where would I find a Criss Craft valve? - Whatever for? - For the racing boat. She needs just a little attention, and she will be beautiful. - Do what you like, I don't go to the dock.

Timmy cursed this place when he did what he did. - So you punish Ollie? - It's easier to lose a father than a son. - You're supposed to be helping me. - What? - Nice canoe. - Fucking canoe? This a genuine Adirondack guideboat. The Ducati of 1899. Fucking "canoe." - Commander Sway used to row that guideboat every morning. You could set a clock by it. What you need? - Eight cylinder head gasket, for a 1939 Criss Craft. - Are you serious? That old speedboat hasn't been out on the lake in 20 years. - Fucking dumb motor, fuck this. - College kids. Work at a hotel on the lake, but don't know a thing about boats. Nice to have a fella like you on the lake. - Why doesn't it fucking work? - Let me try that. - Fuck, I don't need your help. - All right, all right. Hah, see? - I told you.

But I promise, I will find it. - You realize what you've done by agreeing to work, she's a sadist. What are you wearing? - We need to take military action. Your purple lady has been kidnapped! But they have revealed their position. Kill kill kill kill. Tomorrow you die! - Who's out there? - Hey dude, what's your problem? - Let's go. - Retreat! - Hey, we see you man. - Did your papa teach you to fight? - He was neither lover nor fighter. - But your pop taught you music. - I need to find a girl who likes old records. - Remember when you would do anything for a girl, because you thought she would save your life? No woman is worth dying for anymore. We were born too late. - If she weren't rich, she'd just be crazy. - Why does she not go to the dock? - She's afraid she'd jump. - And you don't swim. Runs in the family. - May the water of Sway Lake find me in the Pacific. May 12th, 1944. Dearest Charlie. The pure water of Sway Lake awaits our return. July 6th, 1944. Dearest Charlie. Far from these blood stained seas, codename greatest day in Eskimo history approaches. In love as in war, we judge our allies best by the secrets they keep. You are a keeper of secrets, Charlie. When I open my eyes, I see you again, swimming toward me. I see our guests dancing in the barn to Tweed's orchestra as we sneak to the water. Now that you're a Sway, you and I are in cahoots to ensure that the lake remain a place where time can stop. The music echoes in my ears. And the taste of your skin... Your devoted commander, Hal. - Would you mind looking for Ollie? We're late for the town hearing. - Okay. - Nikolai. Did you move my desk? Well, it'll have to be back where it belongs by dusk. There's dew. - The guideboat was gone, I'll take you. - Typical Oliver, he never cared about the lake. - Hey. ♪ Strolling along the avenue ♪ Whiling the time away ♪ Dreaming of all - Could you do this for me? It always comes undone. - Of course. - A large town dock will bring new boats. Business this community needs. - That's right, Jim! - We give the floor to public comments. - Mrs. Sway. - Look who it is. - I... I grew up on this lake. It used to be-- - Two weeks a year don't give you the right-- - Let her talk! - It used to be this lake connected us to the past, to nature, to each other. To silence. First, we lost the trout. Then, most of the loons. - For God's sake, Mrs. Sway. - While I wish Jim success with his son's jet ski business, a public dock will triple the amount of motors on this lake. When Eel Lake got their dock, they saw milfoil come in from outside boats. It destroyed their purple reed, their fish stock. This isn't about a dock. This is about the water. The purity of this lake, our lake. - You mean your lake! You don't own the lake anymore. - She is so full of it, man. - You hear that? That's a 460Z. One day this lake is gonna be a destination whether you like it or not. Bitch. - Hey, what did you say? - Marlena, are you okay? - You're so sweet, Ollie. Like your father. You know, he did his best for you after your mother left you guys. But it's hard to live without love. - I know. - He was so quiet. Did he ever show you his collection? - Some of it. - Don't say a word, okay? But I can't find a record that Mrs. Sway says is so important. She says she needs the money. I don't trust him. - And once again, Oliver is missing. - I am sorry, Grandmother. - I don't know where else to look. - What are these markings? - Everyone in the family had their own way of ranking records. When I was little I graded these so I wouldn't accidentally DJ subpar music. - Olivia Newton-John. A? - What? She's hot. - Thank you Marlena, I'll take those. - Harry Belafonte. He's like the black Neil Diamond. Julio Iglesias. He's like the Spanish Neil Diamond. - That is a terribly good recording, such a handsome man. - B minus? It's not his best calypso. What are those? - For my laborers. Thank you. - Moscow Mule. Famous American drink. - I gave it four stars. The letter grades were your system, Ollie. I like to think I played a part in Ollie's "calling." Now he knows what people want to hear before they do. - Looks like we agreed on this one. - Not a handsome fellow. What grade did Timmy give it? - You know, Americans would rather organize music than hear it. In Russia, we simply dance. Ollie, you spilled Moscow Mule! - Careful. - What are you doing? - What are you doing? - Trying to throw her off the scent. - Relax, I can fix it. Okay. Done. - Masterful. - I don't know how this work. - You think because I'm a woman I haven't rowed in the ocean? Of course I have. You feather your oars, and cut right into the waves. - I swam in the Arctic Sea. Have you done that? - Try this lake, five AM in April. Hal and I used to swim naked every morning. The water used to be so pure, you could drink it. - In Saint Petersburg, when the ice turns to mud, it spits out treasure. And my pop used to take me to the swamps to look for German corpses, clutching their G41 semi-automatics with no fucking bullets. See, what he loved about the USA is that you don't leave your soldiers dead in the mud. You take every soldier home. And that is what makes this the greatest nation on earth. - Hal would've adored you. - Shit. - Ollie. You're so clumsy. Be careful of Hal's sweater. - Well I'm trying to clean it. - Here, here, here, here. - Ollie. Here we go, here we go. Here we go. - Take it. - Ollie. - You're not getting paid enough to put up with her. - Mice. - I'll take care of that, Marlena. You're not ugly. The perfect record. There you are.

I mean if I had the cash, I would open the kind of place that you could go and it would feel really real. Kind of like this place, actually. - Well, let's hope you have the ambition. - My father, Macklin, whom I adored, he came to Wall Street with nothing. He lost a fortune during the crash. And he told his employees... "I can't pay you, but if you stay I can give you food." They all stayed because they knew he was a gentlemen. He put me through private school, with his bridge earnings. So, anything is possible. It's a shame not everyone in your generation knows how to work hard. - What did you do? - I raised a son and managed a household. Is that not enough? And I married a man who said I was his equal. If I'd been a man, imagine what I'd have done. - You hired a nanny. You gave your son a wad of cash to get him out of your hair. - Your father made himself miserable, made us all miserable. He did nothing but listen to records. As Hal always said, he was an unhappy soul. I did my best with him. Some people are born that way, I didn't wish him ill. Perhaps it would've been better had he never been born.
