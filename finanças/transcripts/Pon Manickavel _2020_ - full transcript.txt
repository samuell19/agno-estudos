HE WHO CAN ACCOMPLISH BY ANY MEANS LET HIM DISCHARGE THAT DUTY ‐ THIRUVALLUVAR EAST COAST ROAD, CHENNAI Oh, God, no! Dad! Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Breaking news! High Court Judge Mr. Srinivasan was shot down and murdered brutally. Around 5 a.m. this morning, High Court Judge Mr.Srinivasan, who had gone for a morning walk, was treacherously murdered by strangers at his ECR farm house. How he was murdered, who killed him, or their motive has not been made clear by the police department. ‐Another dimwit has arrived. ‐Who the hell are you, damn it? ‐Sir! I'll skin you, damn it. Throw him outside. Sir, sir... just a minute, sir. ‐Oh, God. ‐Sir, sir! There's been such a tragic incident. Who is behind this murder? I have no comments at the moment. Sir! We've been waiting for an hour. Please let us in. The threat message on the judge's phone, has it been sent for analysis? Yes, sir. The Police Commissioner has been calling profusely since morning. My ears are bleeding! Didn't I ask you to find the murderer? Locate the severed head of the deceased. Sir, we're trying our level best. Dear viewers, welcome to our show. If this is the state of a High Court judge, then how do we expect them to keep the public safe? Until we get rid of this corrupt government, the safety of the public will be at stake. That's my opinion. Can we count Chennai among the safest cities? We'll debate this matter after a short break. They're tearing us apart in TV, magazines, newspapers and debates. I'll do one thing and transfer this case to CB‐CID. Sir, please give us 10 more days. We will get it solved. Trust us. OFFICE OF THE COMMISSIONER CHENNAI Sir, the murder happened around 5:30‐5:40 a.m. Totally, 4 bullets were fired. All the bullets have an in‐and‐out point. But we couldn't find any bullets at the crime scene. The peculiar and most confusing aspect about it is that the 4 bullets were fired from 2 different guns. The bullets on the left chest are from an 8 mm. A Raven type gun. But the bullets on the right side of the chest were fired from an untraceable gun. Post that, the murderer used a surgical knife to sever the head. It's a peculiar case in recent history. Sir, the judge was running a business on the side. A red colour car was spotted at the time of the murder. Other than that, we don't have any other clue. This was already explained on TV better than you people. Tell me something different. We need to close this case immediately. Sorry to interrupt, sir. ACP Pon Manickavel from Salem is a great gun specialist. Moreover, he holds 5th rank in the All‐India Range Firing competition. In 2012, the goverment selected and sent him for IDA training. He even won a gold medal over there. He's smart, brilliant and honest. And he's extremely focused in his duty. If we speak to him, we might get a clue in this case. Then just call him. Okay, sir. ‐ Hello. ‐Manickavel. This is Commissioner Bala Murugan. Hi, sir, how are you? ‐I'm good. How are you? ‐I'm doing very well. Manickavel... did you hear about High Court Judge Srinivasan's murder? I did, sir. That's the only news on TV since 2 days. It's very complicated. There are exit wounds, but we couldn't find any bullets. It's simple, sir. Every bullet fired from a gun, their exit distance can be calculated leaving the body. Sigma Shooting Technology. An expert will collect the bullets after its exit. Manickavel, is this possible? It's possible for the person who knows the trick. ‐Okay, thank you, Manickavel. ‐Thank you, sir. I think he's the right person for this case. Let's hand it over to him. Sir, but there's a small problem. Six months ago, while he was investigating a sensational case in Salem... Such a rank holder! What are you going to do after quitting this job? I'm going to herd cattle. My instinct says he's the right person for this case. You better convince him. Also make him understand the importance of this case. He's a police officer too. He'll definitely understand. We're meeting him tomorrow, okay? Hello, sir. ‐Welcome, Manickavel. ‐Sir. Please come. Okay, fine. Sir, this is Mr. Manickavel. ‐Sir! ‐Welcome, Manickavel. Sit. Balamurugan spoke about you. ‐Impressive track records. ‐Thank you, sir. We're under immense pressure. You have to solve this case quickly. Okay. sir. I want full freedom in this case. There will be no political interference. I personally assure you. I'll take care of the political interference. I don't want any disturbance from our department. I will be myself. Okay, Manickavel, go ahead. Chidambaram will introduce you to the special team. ‐Good luck. ‐Thank you, sir. Hey, didn't you join the force through recommendation? How did you manage to get into the special team? Obviously, special recommendation. ‐Sir! ‐Good morning, sir! He's Inspector Peruvalathan. He's been following this case since the beginning. He'll be very helpful to you. Very smart. He's equal to 10 people. He's Inspector Nandakumar. He assisted in the Tindivanam murder case. He's Inspector Rajagopal. For now, I just need two officers. Sir, 10 people from this team have been suggested by the Commissioner. For what? I thought he's equal to 10 men. You two follow me. Damn, they ditched us. Looks like special recommendation got jacked. Sir, the judge used to wake up at 5:30 a.m. every day. Yoga and meditation at 6:45 a.m., then, at 7 a.m., he goes off to play tennis. Later, he goes for a walk on the beach. ‐And then‐‐ ‐What did you say your name was? Peruvalathan. Shall we continue after a cup of tea? Sir? I'll freshen up and speak to you. Sir. Peruvalathan, sir. Oh... that's good. ‐This tea sucks. ‐Sir? Can't you find a good place for tea? Just being muscled like Baahubali isn't enough. Try to attain his wisdom too. Sir, we're getting late to leave for the judge's residence. Hey... we're going there to convey our condolences, not to save him. We can get there at our leisure. Sir? ‐Special recommendation? ‐Yes, sir. Settle the bill for this. This is new. The department is not used to this. ‐Hey, hey. Follow us. ‐Okay, sir. ‐Tell me, Anbu. ‐Where are you? I'm heading to the crime scene. Oh, you're with an accused? Sorry, I'll call you later. Dear, it's our Inspector. ‐What is your name? ‐Peruvalathan. ‐Peru... ‐Peruvalathan! It's Baahubali. Fine, get home soon. Bye. Why there are so many people here, like it's a gathering? Clear the area. Sir, sir, they're here for our investigation They've been taking our lives in the name of investigation. ‐What did you say? ‐Nothing, sir. ‐What did you say, damn it? ‐Sir, I didn't say anything. Hey, Baahubali! Why are you getting worked up? Ask everyone to leave. Sir, we'll take their phone numbers and Aadhar cards at least. Why don't you take their passports too? Sir? I've arrived without GPS. Hope I'm at the right place. [recites holy chants] Scene of the crime! I'm gonna photograph the evidence so that I'll get promoted sooner. Sir, the judge used to go for a walk here every day. On the left corner, he used to do yoga and meditation. What's the price of the land over here? ‐Sir? ‐Ma! Sir. Sorry, sir. Sir, I was trying to photograph vital evidence. Thought it might be useful to us. I was going to create a WhatsApp group and share. I was thinking of nabbing the accused as soon as possible. Bloody hell, I'm stuck with numbskulls. ‐Mr. Baahubali. ‐Sir. We're done with the investigation for the day. You can leave. We'll meet tomorrow. Thank goodness I took my bike. How long have you planned to sleep hugging a book? Why would I hug a book once the exams are over? Fine. I wasn't home yesterday. Did you miss me? You're right. If our parents were here, it would've been better. Sir has rejoined duty after a long gap. Didn't you miss anyone? Shall I give you an idea so that we don't miss each other? An average‐looking mini Anbarasi like you. What? And an awesome mini Manickavel like me. Oh! Shall we prep for it? ‐The plan sounds good though... ‐Thank you. ...but can be executed only after the exams. Didn't you mention the same last year too? Is it? I forgot about that. You better leave for work right now. He worked as a driver at the judge's residence for 15 years. Now he works here. If we interrogate him... Come on! Sir, that's him. Brother! Others can continue with their work. ‐Sir, I have nothing to do with it. ‐Shall we have a tea? I'll get it right away, sir. ‐Name? ‐Narasimhan. When was the last time you saw the judge? ‐Tell me, dear. ‐Hello! How was the dosa? How... was the dosa? You're asking me this now? Obviously! You left without saying anything. Do you think this is a house or a restaurant? I'll make you starve tonight. Bloody idiot! I'm break your teeth. Hey, Baahubali! Hey! Sir, when I questioned, he's being arrogant. Sir, I was right with my replies. But he's beating me out of spite. How dare you tell on me? Go... go and check if the tea is ready. Go! Sir, come on. Sir, please come. Let's go. ‐Take this. ‐I don't want it, sir. ‐You're bleeding. ‐Sir, your tea. Come on, have this. ‐Damn it! ‐Sir, don't get angry. If they had given me 2 more days, I would've solved the case. He's totally useless. ‐Sir, don't get worked up. ‐Damn! How long have you been working? It's been 6 months, sir. ‐Sir, I don't want. ‐Take it. Hey, what the hell is he doing? Sir, I don't want it. Sir, please listen to me. ‐Sir, please I don't need it. ‐For medical expenses. Sir, be patient. ‐My ill fate I'm stuck with him. ‐Sir! Advocate Ramachandran is the judge's close friend. He never does anything without his consent. ‐Do you know the address? ‐Yes, I do. ‐Nanda. ‐Sir! Okay, sir. Give me the address. Manickavel, sir, if we deal this case in your style, it will never work out. I will tell you frankly, sir. Someone about to confess will defer due to your methods. I don't mind even if you take me wrong. I did get offended. You stay right here. No, I didn't meet the judge that day. Sir. Sir, sir, I'm coming. You should ask Inspector Rathnavel for personal information. 1927... 1927... I'm slogging here for the exams, and you're sleeping peacefully. You should keep your mind relaxed a day before the exam. Don't touch the books. Come on, come over here. ‐Come closer. ‐Let go of my hand. You're always... I can't remember these years and events. Is that so? Fine, tell me when is my birthday. April 3rd. Tell me what we did on that day? We both went to Vinayagar Temple on that day. I was wearing a blue sari; you wore a black shirt and white pants. After that? After which, we had ice cream. I remember everything. ‐How's that? ‐That's because... I like you very much. Like what you study. It's fine to study what you like, but how to remember Partition of Bengal and Simon Commission? What are you doing? Simon Commission. 1927. Simon Commission. 1927! What about Partition of Bengal? This is Bengal, and this is India. It's 1905. 1905, Partition of Bengal. Oh, God. Now what do I assign to this? India's atom bomb tragedy. Ah, 1974... Are you really prepping me for the exam? Of course, dear. Come here. ‐In 1974... ‐But there are more events. We have more places to cover. Get lost, you brat!

You go to your office, and I'll go for my exams. ‐Okay. ‐Bye. Why aren't you at work? Sir, this is Peruvalathan. I have that Royapuram Ravi over here. I'm out with my wife for an important work I'll call you later. Being around his wife... seems to be an important work. He doesn't have to come over. ‐I'm gonna question him myself. ‐Sir, sir, sir... Sir, why do you want to risk it? Let's wait for him to come. As if he's going to do anything. We'll nab them with great difficulty... but when he arrives, we'll start talking only after cup of tea. ‐Watch how I'm gonna handle this. ‐Sir, please wait. Tell me. Sir, it's not a big deal to lease a shop at the fish market. I hacked one guy's hand over there. The judge witnessed that incident and locked me up with a non‐bailable warrant. I got pissed off, so I threatened to kill him. Otherwise, I have nothing to do with this case. Fine, looks like you didn't find the guy. I wonder what kind of investigation you guys carry out. Hey, how dare you? Do you think the police are a joke? Sir, don't raise your hand for no reason. It won't turn out good. What do you mean? What do you mean by that, damn it? Come on, tell me, damn it! Tell me what will go wrong. ‐Tell me, damn it. ‐Sir, don't hit me. ‐Hey, I'm gonna‐‐ ‐Sir, please don't. Sir, I sent it on our WhatsApp group by mistake. Give it to me. Sir, don't hit me. Sir! ‐Hey! ‐Hey! What are you doing? Take your hands off him. Out. Get out! Don't you dare touch anyone in regards to this case anymore. They brought in cattle herder and expect him to solve a case. I'm gonna resign from this team. To hell with everyone. Hello! Sir, is Peruvalathan at the station? I am his wife. Peruvalathan sir left long ago. Sir, he was supposed to pick up our daughter from school. Sir, his wife is on the phone. I have no clue what happened. I've been trying to call him for a very long time. Tell me, madam. This is the DC speaking. Sir, he said will be picking up our daughter from school. It's been two hours. He hasn't returned yet. I tried calling his phone. It's ringing, but he isn't answering. I don't know what to do now. I'm really scared, sir. It's nothing. I've sent him on an errand. He'll be home anytime. Don't you dare touch anyone in regards to this case anymore. Hey, how dare you lay your hands on me? I'll make sure you pay for it. Daddy! Daddy! Uncle, please don't beat up my dad. Please, uncle! Brother, a police officer beat me up. We should make him pay for it. Daddy! Please don't beat my dad. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy... Daddy. Isn't this the hand that touched my brother? Give that to me. Oh, no! Please let my dad go. Hereafter, they'll think twice before laying their hands on Royapuram's men. Hey! This conflict is between brothers. You better leave! Everyone in the department is like a brother to me. You keep playing over here. Uncle will play for a while too. Uncle! Uncle! Inspector Marikattan Adhiyaman Peruvalathan. Daddy, Daddy. Is it hurting too much, Dad? Nothing to worry about, dear. A police officer should know when to fight and when to be calm. Sir. ‐Peruvalathan. ‐Sir. Should a police officer work for the department? Or work for the public? Sir, isn't both the same? There's a huge difference. ‐I don't understand. ‐You'll understand eventually. OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER CHENNAI Sir! Who are we meeting today, Peruvalathan? ‐Wait, hold on. ‐What's up with him? Let's discuss it over tea. ‐Fantastic tea! ‐Thank you, sir. Only now you've come to my terms, Peruvalathan. Sir, you can continue calling me Baahubali. Fine... that advocate mentioned about an Inspector Rathnavel the other day. Yes. Shall we meet him? Why is the door locked? ‐Hey, Muthu. ‐Yes, sir. Give our number to the granny next door. ‐Ask her to call when he is home. ‐Okay, sir. Sir, this is Inspector Rathnavel. I was told you came home to see me. What is the matter, sir? Nothing much. Just a general inquiry. Are you free to meet? I'm a little busy with personal work. ‐Let's meet tomorrow. No problem. ‐Thank you, sir. Just for a day's fun, I have to beg you the entire week. ‐Playing hardball? ‐Yes. Shalu, let's meet tomorrow. ‐What happened? ‐Please let's meet tomorrow. Go. What is it, Rathnavel? Why are you calling back? I got a threatening message from an unknown number. ‐What is the message? ‐It says, "Enjoy your last hour." Sir, I'm really scared. You're a policeman. Don't be scared. ‐Where are you? ‐I'm at Hotel Pallazzio. Okay, stay right there. I will come. Rathnavel, where are you? I'm heading towards the parking lot. Okay, I'll be right there. Sir, where are you? I'm heading towards the parking lot. Come soon. Sir! ‐Not able to reach him. ‐Sir, look over there. Peruvalathan! Sir, I am okay, sir. I am okay. What's happening, Manickavel? We never got a resolution in the judge's murder. Now a second murder. That too from our department. Do you think there's a connection between these murders? I don't think so, sir. These two murders were done by two different people. Manickavel, I hope you understand the pressure. ‐Higher officials‐‐ ‐Sir, I need more time. I'll submit a clear report. Sir, if the murderer made his kill despite the fact that we're going to be here, I'm sure there's a link between the judge's murder and this. Both were done by different people. No, sir, I think it's the same person. I think he has been following us. Sir, that too during the bomb blast those 3 and 1/2 minutes, all CCTV cameras on the floor were hacked to run in a loop. ‐Analyse Rathnavel's phone. ‐Sure, sir. Right away. ‐Have you recovered the files? ‐Yes, we've recovered it. ‐Good. ‐Thank you, sir. But something is seriously wrong, sir. Someone has used this mobile phone 48 hours ago. And they've stolen the data from it. Can you trace the device on which it was copied? Sure, sir. It's Sony Vaio, 2015 model. IP address? Sir, we got his house address from the IP address. It's an independent house at KK Nagar 2nd Street. You take the force along. I'm on my way. Freeze! Sir, he's not budging. Sir, when we were inquiring at the travel agency, I saw him following us. It's not only at the agency. Tea shop. The judge's house. The inspector's house. You've been following us everywhere. I know that you're not the murderer. Tell me. Sir, sir, sir... sir Hey, get lost! ‐Sir, sir... ‐Out! Sir! Sir. Hey! He's belongs to our department too. Undercover. He's dealing with the same case. Buy him tea, and tell him I apologised... and relieve him. ‐Did you see that? ‐Yes, sir. Our men don't trust us. It's that police instinct. Sorry, you don't look like a police officer. ‐That's why he's an undercover cop. ‐Shut up! I met the DGP last evening. Morning, sir. Manickavel, meet Mr. Kailash. Undercover unit. We met already, sir. Yes, sir. As it's a high‐profile case, few things were decided by the higher‐ups without our knowledge. I hope you understand. Tell me, Kailash. Sir. These pictures were hacked from Rathnavel's phone. The third person in this picture is Arjun K. Maran. He's a successful businessman. He might have something to do with these murders. Maybe he is the next target. So, if we question him personally, it will help us to take this case to the next level. So, then contact him immediately. We did try contacting him... but right now he's in Germany. So, what's next? He'll be back on Monday. ‐We'll talk to him in person. ‐Okay. Sir, you haven't been handling this case with seriousness. What I meant is you're serious about it... but if you handle it more seriously, it'll be better. Actually, sir, if you're sincere, we can nab that killer in a day. Oh, no, sir. What are you doing? Sir, what's wrong with you? What is it DC sir? Your wife wanted you to be the first to hear the good news that she passed. I've been calling and texting. There's no response from you. Is sir too busy to respond? Anbu... there's a birthday party. Get ready soon. We'll go for it. Why there's no response from you? As if you responded to me. Hey, weren't you very sure about your results after the exams? So, where's the surprise in this matter? That doesn't mean you can't congratulate me. Congrats. I'll take a shower. You get ready. I am not going. It's the DGP daughter's birthday. I promised him to bring my family. Please let's go. Remind me to get a bouquet on our way. As if the party is too important. Thanks. Is that all I am getting? Don't you think it's too much? A thanks is more than enough for this cake. One second. Good morning, sir. Seems like you were here since last night. Thank you. Thank you so much. Hi, sir. Good morning. ‐Hi! ‐Morning. Sir, sorry. He's got an appointment right away. So, please don't take more than 5 minutes. Sir, the two people with you in this picture are not alive anymore. Someone has meticulously planned and murdered them both. Maybe you're the next target of that killer. Before we can arrest that killer, we're here to give you protection. Please try to understand and cooperate with us, sir. In Europe, they're comparing Tamil Nadu Police with the Scotland Yard. Look here. This is from my birthday party at Le Méridien. There are 7 other people, excluding me. So, tell me, who's next? With this evidence, if we follow your stupid logic, then tell me. I'll tell my secretary to give you their email IDs, addresses and phone numbers. Thank you. Then what is your relationship with the judge and this inspector? Now, look here. Srinivasan was my legal counsel before he became a judge. And I met that inspector through Judge Srinivasan. I've seen him only 2‐3 times. Anyway... thank you, sir. What about the inquiry? We didn't get any clue from his side. So, what's the next plan? Pon Manickavel, are you there? I'll keep you posted, sir. ‐Make it quick. ‐Sure, sir. ‐Fine, then. ‐Thank you. Hey, why are you rushing? Sir, I've informed everything about Maran's meeting to the Commissioner. As he's got political influence, as per the Commissioner's instructions, we're planning to give full protection to Maran without his knowledge. I mean this evening... ‐Hey. Hey! ‐...after we nab the killer‐‐ After nabbing the killer? Are you going to hang him to death tomorrow? It's not that. There's pressure from the department. The Commissioner has asked for a swift‐‐ Remember, 6 months ago, a watchman was killed at your apartment. ‐What happened to that case? ‐Sir, what happened was... Why are you stuttering now? Watchman and that case. Just because the deceased was a judge, a special team right away, immediate investigation, and a prompt report. So, there's partiality when it comes to the dead as well. Sir, I'm not sure what you're getting at. That's right. You won't understand. You will when you experience it. How many are stationed at the 1st Main Road? Sir, there are 5 officers here. Be alert! Make gram vadas instead of masala vadas. Okay, fine. ‐What's that noise? ‐Isn't that a dead end? ‐Mosquitoes. ‐Three are stationed here, sir. Not enough. Ask 6 officers to be there. Okay, sir. There are 8 cops stationed at the corner of 5th Cross Street. Will you be late tonight? There's an officer here who'll be done soon, then I will come. Bye! ‐Hello, sir. ‐Hello! ‐Come in, sir. ‐Have you blocked all the roads? Yes, we have barricaded the roads. ‐Be alert. ‐Sir, we're wide alert. ‐Muthu? ‐Tell me, sir. Ask them to reduce the volume of the walkie‐talkies. ‐Brother... ‐Hey! South, South‐West. North, North‐West. What will you do if they jump from the sky? Ask to nab them sooner. It's getting late. I'm longing for vadas. Stop! Don't shoot. Catch him! Sir! The suspect is escaping from the beach side. I repeat, I repeat. The suspect is escaping from the beach side. Sir, he got away. Oh, shit! ‐Sir, I warned‐‐ ‐Do you realise now why we warned you? I don't know, sir. I don't know what's happening. Anyway, you guys have to look after it. Yes, Kailash here. I got a threatening message that I'll die in 24 hours. What? I need to meet Manickavel right away. Sir, do you have an appointment? Tell him it's the Scotland Police. Manickavel, if the press knows about the threat to my life, my share value will drop by 20%. How much does 20% add up to? Around Rs. 50 crore. That's a big amount. If it's 50 for just threatening your life, what if they kill you? No, just for conversation. Don't play around, Manickavel. This company is nothing without me. Total Rs. 500 crore loss. Rs. 500 crore. So, sir, isn't 20% of Rs. 50 crore Rs. 10 crore? Shall we crack a small deal between us? You give that Rs. 10 crore to me. I'll make sure you'll be safe without a scratch. I will take care. With extra care. Even the Grim Reaper can't touch your soul. Sir, what are you thinking about? I'm not asking for a share in your profits. Instead, I'm asking for a share from your loss. In my entire life as a businessman, you are the first who has asked for a share in my loss. I did stay sincere after completing my IPS training. Nothing great. Six months ago, I worked as an ASP at Salem. There was a remarkable case. I wasn't aware it will turn my life upside down. I get really outraged looking at injustice. And if it's happening in my area, there's no space for anything but action. It's the same reward for all the emotions. But you're overreacting though. Come on, take it all. Hey, do you have an arrest warrant? Warrants are for arresting humans. But to hunt down rabid dogs like you, why do we need a warrant? INTEGRATED COURT COMPLEX, SALEM Sir, look what they've done to us! Just look how they've messed up our lives. Sir, sir, just look at the state of my daughter. Oh, God! Oh, God, my dear daughter! They turned her into ashes. My daughter used to work in that sinner's jewelry shop. She used to refuse to go to work every day. But I thought she was making excuses to skip work and being lazy. Only now I realised that her boss at the shop was harassing her all the while. As that girl's body was burned, we couldn't get the traces of semen. Maybe the accused burnt the body with that intention. Dear Lord, no mother should endure my pain. Owing to this... people will be scared to have a girl child. The police have failed to prove the crime committed by the accused, Modilal Seth. So, this court has let him walk free. Oh, God, my daughter's murderer has been let out without punishment! As a mother, I'm outraged! Oh, God! Well done! Well done! You just tore them apart. Awesome. Do you have a lighter? Oh! All the evidence you need is here. You got to prove it legally now. People like him don't belong to this society. Hey! You'll be tarnished to dust. ‐Don't laugh. ‐Get lost. Your death will be gruesome. Listen, sir. The person who burned and killed my daughter is walking free with a smile. Please kill him, sir. Sir, shoot and kill him! ‐Come to the party this evening. ‐Sure! Shoot him down, sir. Shoot him, sir. Shoot him, sir! Shoot and kill him! Sir. We reached home. Why is there blood on you? What happened? Shoot him, sir. Shoot him, sir! Shoot and kill him! ‐I won't spare you! ‐Okay, sure we'll be there. No! This gun is of no use to anyone. It's existence is moot. No! What is this, Mr. Manickavel? I never expected this from an honest and passionate police officer like you. I understand your pain. But all this is a part of the service. Sir, I didn't wear this uniform for the sake of it. I wore this 'cause I loved it. The pain of removing it... only I can realize it. It's totally different in practical compared to theory. Nothing seems right. I understand, Mr.Manickavel. But take your own time. Please think about it. No, sir, God gave me enough time to think. You're taking this decision based on emotions. Just think about you and your family. Such a rank holder... what are you going to do after quitting this job? I'm gonna herd the cows. Once I finished IPS training... the moment of happiness when I held the gun for the first time that feeling... I believed will last until I die. My gun which was destined to kill a thousand criminals... became a reason to kill an innocent life. That pain... will haunt me until I die. My wisdom and the lesson that I did not receive from the IPS training that one incident taught me a hard lesson. So, I started playing my second innings just for the money. I wanna make millions, sir. Why are you looking at me like that? Won't we have a desires to get a taste of your lifestyle? What will be the size of this house? Beach is right next to it, and a swimming pool inside the house. Sir, don't you wanna enjoy this throughout your life. Just trust me, I'll take care of everything. Sir! ‐Sir! ‐Morning! Run the exterior camera. The security detail is good. Impressive. Thank you. Sure. ‐Okay? ‐Okay, thank you. Sir, it's the Commissioner. ‐Hello ‐Yes, sir. How is it going, Manickavel? I will take care, sir. Sir! What happened, Manickavel? ‐Sir let's go. ‐Damn it! Sir... no! Sir... Search the opposite building right away. ‐Okay, sir. ‐Fast! Go fast! Show me all the cameras pointing at the opposite building. Okay, sir. ‐Nanda, we've checked it thoroughly. ‐Sir! Only the rifle is here. ‐You've done a great job, Manickavel. ‐Thank you, sir. Sir, despite the fact the security was tight. Instead of getting closer... they staged a sniper shot 900ft from the opposite building. Thank you, Manickavel. Thank you. Brother, I require the CCTV footage from the mosque gate. Manickavel, did you get the money? I'm very sure that the money will arrive on time. I've sent you a video, please have a look. ‐Well done, Kailash. ‐Thank you, sir. Did you see the video? I did, Manickavel. It was him who killed the Judge. Also it was him who killed the Inspector in a blast. And it was him, who came to kill you at your house. Also it was him on the sniper yesterday. Take more money if you want... kill that old man! Fine, tell me what's your conflict with that old man? We had our differences in the business. Don't worry, sir. No matter where he is, I'll bring him to you. Relax! "It's practically different from what I had studied." "Nothing is right, sir." I Pon Manickavel... do solemnly affirm that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India as by the law established. I am proud of my country. And I'll always be faithful to my Mother India. Jai Hind! "Won't we have the desires to get a taste of your lifestyle?" Did you go through the details of the new hotel project? Okay, thank you. See you guys later. Thank you. Manickavel, my daily routine must be boring for you. Let's have a party tonight.

His native is Nedumpalayam village next to Ambur. He used to run a small leather business out there. His daughter and son‐in‐law died in an accident. In that depression he lost focus on business and failed. The only consolation in this tragedy was his grand daughter. She worked hard and joined an Engineering college in Chennai under merit. She used to do part time jobs during her education. Hosting events at malls and hotels... wedding receptions and working in Ad‐films. She used that money to cover her expenses for education. In one such occasion, Maran spotted her at an Ad‐shoot. He tried to pursue her... got her number through an agent and started flirting with her. Sent her many messages. Initially she was patient, but later filed a complaint with the police. Since he was influential nothing happened. So, that girl made use of #MeToo. Tagged everyone from the Commissioner till an ordinary police officer in a post. That post went viral! And Arjun K. Maran was arrested overnight. But they came to know during the investigation... that his mobile phone was lost at the hotel. Also he blocked the sim and has filed a complaint in regards to it. Once it was proved in court, that he didn't send those messages... subsequently Maran was released. Unfortunately, shortly after these incidents... that girl died in a train accident. That's what Police records states. But, sir... must be wondering why this elderly is set out to kill Maran? As per my investigation... I went to his native and investigated few of his near and dear ones. And then when I finally went to his house. I found a diary written by him. My son and daughter‐in‐law died in an accident. I incurred a huge loss by not focusing on the business. I was almost on the verge of killing myself. Grandpa, please don't leave me behind. Grandpa, please get down. Grandpa, please don't leave me behind. That's when my grand daughter, saved me and gave a new meaning to my life Grandpa! "My dear Princess, reminiscing dahlia" "come to me 'O' dear" "come to me 'O' dear" "just your glance floods my heart" "come to me 'O' dear" "come to me 'O' dear" "I ruminate 'bout you without sleeping late in the night" "so does the moon, which stares back at me" "my desire is to see you scale the peaks" "only then my soul will depart this world" "you're my mother of love" "My dear Princess, reminiscing dahlia" "come to me 'O' dear" "come to me 'O' dear" "just your glance floods my heart" "Grandpa!" "come to me 'O' dear" "paintings will come to take lessons from you" "flowers will gather and bloom one like your shadow" "through your magical eyes" "I followed you turning into your mother" "followed you" "I'm short on words 'O' my dear" "I'm just an ordinary disciple of you" "the touch of your precious hands, turns the sand into gold" "My dear Princess, reminiscing dahlia" "come to me 'O' dear" "come to me 'O' dear" "just your glance floods my heart" "come to me 'O' dear" "come to me 'O' dear" "come to me 'O' dear" "come to me 'O' dear" "come to me 'O' dear" In order to keep in touch with me everyday... she bought a phone for me, from her first month's salary. Hi grandpa! Why did you spend so much, dear? It was not necessary. Grandpa, didn't you say you wanted to see me everyday? Now you can see me everyday on video call. Why are you coughing, grandpa? Nothing much, it's the cold. I hope you're taking your medicines on time. Yeah, I've been taking them on time. ‐I'll top the class, grandpa. ‐That's great, dear. Fine, when are you coming home? I'll come down next week for sure. ‐Who is that? ‐Just a minute, grandpa. Maran after getting out of the prison, went crazy over my grand daughter. He sent his men... they beat up my grand daughter and took away right in front of my eyes. Let go of me! I was baffled and went to the Police station. Sir. Sir... please have a look at this. few people took away my grand daughter, while she was on phone. When I tried calling again, it says switched‐off. Not sure what happened to her. Please, please. No one respected my plea neither gave a resolution. Two days later, I saw my grand daughter as a corpse. "My dear Princess, reminiscing dahlia" "You're my precious" "You're my precious" "just your glance floods my heart" "You're my precious" "You're my precious" "I ruminate 'bout you without sleeping late in the night" "so does the moon, which stares back at me" "my desire is to see you live long and happy life" My grand daughter was the only reason for my happiness in life. When she passed away... I was clueless in what to do? I lost faith in law, justice and integrity. The people who were the reason for my grand daughter's death... I wanted to avenge them with my bare hands. Before killing these men... he tried buying guns illegally in Salem. And was caught by the police. Nasrathullah was locked up here for buying a gun illegally. One of his cell‐mate was sentenced to death. He was punished. Another cell‐mate was Bhoominathan. Just this last week, he got out of the jail If we try and catch him... or if we can find the details on the second gun in Judge's murder case we can close this case. Good job, Kailash. ‐Karthick are the papers ready? ‐Ready, sir. Sir, construction work is on as per the schedule. But only the interior work is getting a bit delayed. I've already warned them about it. Hello, sir! This project was supposed to get over 3 months ago. ‐Why is the delay? ‐Sir, it's like... Sir! Stay inside, until I say so. Sir, come on, come on. Come on, come on... There are glass pieces inside his abdomen. It can be removed only after a surgery. it's quite critical though. Please put your signature on this consent form Doctor is he in danger? Sorry, I can't say anything now. We will let you know after the surgery. ‐Hello! ‐Arjun K. Maran, here. Yes, sir, Dr. Chandrashekar here. Sir, patient is seriously ill now. We will do our best. I don't care about the expense, he should be saved. Let me know if you need doctors from abroad. I'll make arrangements immediately. Okay, sir. Sir. Good morning, sir. ‐Where is he? ‐At 2nd floor, CCU. ‐ Let's go. Sir! How is he doing? The surgery is in process. They're stating it's quite critical. How can you send him in, without any back‐up or security? How did it happen? Sir, one minute. Sir, Manickavel himself is responsible for his state. What are you saying? When he went to Arjun K. Maran's house in regards to Judge's murder case... he discovered that something is fishy. As he has high level political influence... we couldn't force him for a statement. So, Kailash placed a bug in his house without his knowledge. When we heard their conversation... we learned that there's a 4th person involved in this case. When we were clueless about the 4th person. Sir, if we wish to know who that 4th person is... Arjun K. Maran should trust us blindly. I have a plan. In order to spook him, Manickavel sent him a threatening message. Arjun K. Maran, who got spooked by the message... I need to meet Manickavel, right away. In order to be around him all the time... he tried to win his trust by taking a bribe from him. "Give me that 10 crores" Making use of this opportunity. Manickavel was around Arjun K. Maran all the time. The shootout at that building was staged by Manickavel. Sir! Post that incident, Arjun K. Maran started trusting Manickavel. Oh! Thank you, Manickavel It's okay. It's okay. This incident occurred during one such instance. Manickavel must know the clue about the 4th person... 'cause he would've seen the face of the killer. Manickavel risked his life for the sake of our department. "Life is a testament of downfall and rising" "All you need is a push to rise high" "Her breath is enough to embark on this journey" "my eyes are going dry in the duress" "to have a lap to sleep on forever" "forever my heart will beat for you" Don't worry, he'll be fine. The entire department is with you as a support. Moorthy, I want your complete focus on Manickavel's recovery. And I want him back to work. "Life is a testament of downfall and rising" He's right here, dad. Listen, dad wants to speak to you. Here, take this. "All you need is a push to rise high" "Her breath is enough to embark on this journey" You can't be as good cook as I am. Oh, no! Hey, why are you getting scared for silly matters? Hey! Don't you dare come back to the kitchen, get lost. Thought at least today I will have a good meal. Get lost! Sir... ‐Follow my instructions. ‐Okay, sir Excuse me, I need a favor from you. Yes. sir. I need the entire CCTV footage from May 20th. Sorry, sir, during the fire accident that occurred last month... the entire stock of CCTV footage was destroyed. We've already filed a complaint at the Police station. I'll tell you, how to proceed further. Okay, sir. Sir! ‐A small information regarding this case. ‐Sir. On May 20th an Ad‐shoot happened at the same Hotel. The production company will definitely have the footage. You track that down and get it immediately. Definitely, sir. Sir, hard disk. Sir, this is Karthikeyan from Armory. Tell me, sir. Sir, we got the details on the second gun used in Judge's murder. It's M51, Taiwan gun. It's quite a complicated gun. As it's a front loading gun... it's hard to use this gun, without proper training. And usually this gun is available in the market. As per our records, in 2008... Govt. imported these guns from Taiwan. Is it possible to trace the address from the list of gun owners? We don't have that data list with us. Then, what else? I think, there are chances if we try the Delhi armory. Delhi armory is the only source, where we can find the details of the unknown gun. Contact them right away. Please get all my reports. He holds an iPhone 10. Diamond Edition. Inquire at all the iStore dealers in Chennai. As that phone is a special edition... the list of buyers will be less. Sir, a total of 150 people have bought this phone. Purchase date. Age wise. Short list everything. ‐Hello. ‐Sir... the date you've mentioned we tracked down the number in that hotel tower range. ‐Share the location ‐Okay, sir. Sir, how come you're going alone? I'm ready now. ‐Hi, Manickavel ‐You managed to save Maran from my men. ‐if you can, try saving your wife. Manick! Manick! Manick! Let go of him, damn it! Let go of him. ‐Anbu, go from here. ‐Let go of him. Manick! ‐Anbu are you okay? ‐I'm okay. Hey, tell me. Who sent you damn it? Manickavel! Sir, who the hell is he? What does he have to do with me? The other day an old man came to kill you... today he has come. We're clueless who will come for us next. Sir, I can't blindly handle this case without knowing its history. Sorry! Manickavel! Only one person is the reason, why these two came to kill me. And the name of that person is, Badrinath. He's a successful businessman in State, Central and International level. Hi, please to meet you. ‐Hello. ‐So, what's going on? The project is near completion. Cheers! He has the full support from the Home Minister and the Govt. I used to be his shell‐face. But one day he said that will make me a partner in a new 500 crore project And asked me to come to Taj Hotel. My pleasure, sir. Yes! Yes! He is psychotic, when it comes to women. If he likes a girl... even if she's ugly, he'll go extremes to attain her. He'll use them as long as he wants... and then he'll kill them. I live my life, King Size! He bumped into a girl at the hotel's elevator. Okay. Yeah, sure. I'll call you back. Hi, can I have your number? During that meeting I came to know, that girl got him upset. Good Morning, Mr. Badri. ‐This the Judge and the Inspector. ‐Hi sir... Sir, you had asked them to come. They're here to help us. Sir, you wanted to meet them regarding our project. Is something upsetting you? I didn't want to lose out on the deal. I went and spoke to the agent. What is that girl's name? It's Dhanya, she's a college student. She's working part‐time. Give me your price. Sorry Sir, she's not the type you're looking for. I took her number from him and spoke to her myself. She turned that into a big issue and got me arrested. I was never humiliated so much in my life. With the help of Judge Srinivasan, I got out easily. Once I got out of the prison, I wanted to kill her. Let me go! Please... Please, sir, let me go. Please, sir. I beg of you, please let me go. ‐Please... ‐You got me arrested. Ma! That's when Badrinath called and asked me not to kill her... and to send her to him. We arranged a corpse matching her blood group and staged a train accident Inspector Rathnavel helped us with it. Hey, Inspector, not planning to go inside? I'll go in first. Judge, sir, please wait. I'll show you something more interesting Oh, god, let go of me. Ma! Once I was done with her. I sent her to Badrinath. Just like what he does with other girls... he has her at his ECR godown and torturing her sexually. Help! HELP! Please someone save me. Help! ‐Please let me go, I beg you. ‐Easy. Easy! Please let me go, please ‐Please don't, please let me go. ‐Try this, you'll feel better. Let go of me... Don't! Please let go of me. I passed out of IPS with a Gold Medal... did you think, I did that to work with criminals like you? Don't! I would've killed you the day I met you. Badrinath! This name... I was waiting for this moment. Manickavel, please don't kill me. Don't! Don't! "I spotted a streak of fire" "I set the same, raging on to this forest" "The forest burned down to the ground" "We've left behind the footprint of bravery" "Blazing lightning has struck the sea to rise high" "The sky is becoming clear with birds chirping songs of hope" "I spotted a streak of fire" "I set the same, raging on to this forest" Careful... Careful! Who is this girl and what happened to her? Fine, I'll go and get some water to drink. Let go of me! Please let go of me. What happened? I can't bear this, let me go. Oh, no, nothing dear, don't be scared. Nothing's wrong, don't be scared. He's your brother, don't be scared. Please let go of me... ‐...please. ‐have some water. Take this, nothing to worry. Don't be scared, we're here for you. Sir. Manickavel, come right away to Badrinath's house Home Minister is on the way. Come as soon as possible. Make sure you're in uniform. Brother... please kill them all! Brother, please kill them all. Please brother. No other girl should endure what I went through. I should be the last one. Please brother, kill them all. Please brother. Good Morning, Madam. Badri! Don't worry about anything. Everything is under control When will you nab that old man? Listen Badri, we've made all the arrangements to catch him. We have full support from the Central. You don't have to worry. When will you nab the old man? Badri, please try to understand. When will you nab the old man? Sir, ma'am is calling you. Madam! Murthy, why is it so difficult to catch an old man? Who the hell is he? He's challenging to kill in 12 hours... and have been texting with a deadline. Madam, this is a complicated case. We're aware of it. ‐Actually we're trying to‐‐ ‐To heck with your try... didn't he kill earlier, just like this after texting? Yes madam! Then? Look here, Murthy... what happened before in this case or what will happen? I'm not asking you to sketch me a plan. He has challenged to kill him by tonight. What action have you taken till now? After the Judge's murder... we have a special team under Pon Manickavel doing an investigation. What did you say his name was? Pon Manickavel. Ah... Pon Manickavel. Where is he? I wanna see him right now. I've already informed him, he's on his way. Sir! Badri, please relax. ‐Sir! ‐Mmmm. Ma'am! Madam, he's been handling the case since the beginning. Very brilliant, he cracked all the loop holes in this case. But he hasn't caught the old man. I don't need to hear his history. Manickavel, from now on Tilak is in‐charge of this case. It's enough you assist him with what he needs in regards to this case. ‐Sir? ‐Hey! Out! Sorry. So, you're that Pon Manickavel. Why can't you just shoot an old man? I'll nab that old man by tonight. Just watch. As I said earlier, those variants of guns, we're not importing anymore... 'cause of its complicated handling. Can I have the list of gun owners? And is it still being used by any of the officers? No, I don't think so. Wait, wait, wait! I think there was a batch in 2009. We've given M55 gun for training at IDA. Okay, can I have that list of names? I'll try and send you that, yeah. ‐Thank you. ‐Okay, okay, madam. Welcome Madam. ‐One minute... uh. ‐Okay, Madam. Hello! Badri, hope the security is fine? Everything is alright... but the Police no matter how much you pet the snake it tends to bite back one day that's the nature you know. Badri any issues? Even if there is a single small issue... even if the God decides to appear can't do squat to me. Sir, there are security cameras around the house... and constables are posted at every nook and corner. There are drones flying around the house... spread across the area. Sir, we have everything under control. You don't have to worry about anything, I don't trust your department... but I trust you! Thank you, sir. Sir! Sir, come inside. Yes, cover him completely. ‐Sir, he's leaving. ‐Oh, God! Come on quick, come on, come on. From which directions was it fired? it came from the rooftop, sir. I think it's was from North East Direction. ‐Badrinath, please stay. ‐Sir, please stay. ‐Badrinath. ‐Sir, I have everything under control. You don't have to worry about it. Sir, I... Sir, it's not safe outside Ma'am, Mr. Badri is leaving. Tilak, where he feels it's comfortable you get there and protect him. Yes Ma'am, I'm following him. ‐Okay, do it. ‐Sure ma'am. Move, move, move everyone! Sir, Bhoominathan who was in prison works at Mani workshop at Royapuram that's what his brother mentioned, Sir, he hardly speaks to anyone... but doesn't fail to pay 5 times, and keeps it to himself. Think harder, it's an important case. Sir, even Pon Manickavel was our cell mate. Did you say Pon Manickavel? Yes sir, he's from your department. Tell me, Kailash, sir Did Pon Manickavel serve time at Salem prison? Yes, sir. Asst. Commissioner Pon Manickavel was careless during his duty and was irresponsible that made him responsible for loss of a life. According to IPC section 287 this court sentences him to the prison for 6 months. Hey, why didn't you mention this earlier? Sir, earlier you just asked about Nasrathullah. Only now you inquired about Pon Manickavel. So, I've mentioned everything about him. Tomorrow, if you ask about Palanisami, then I will speak about him. Hang up, damn it. Guys seal this place right now. ‐Don't worry, sir, we're armed. ‐Okay. Come on, guys! Sir, where did he go? ‐Where is he? ‐Where's your boss? Sir! Tell me, tell me damn it. Sir, sorry about what happened out there. I have secured this place. Hey... you fools! Why are you guys here? Go and protect everything upstairs. I don't want your protection here. Get out! Out! Out! Hello... did you collect the details of the cases dealt by Pon Manickavel? Sir, when he was stationed in Targakapatti of Salem district... handled 7 cases in total from which 4 were sentenced to prison. Remaining 3 got out using their influence. Give the contact numbers of those 3 people. Sorry sir, those 3 died recently. How did that happen? In one case, brother of the accused killed him. In another case, the accused got killed by his enemy. And the third committed a suicide Is there a co‐incidence among them? All of them were shot dead. Nothing else is common in the case. ‐Gun shot? ‐Yes, sir. Can you mail me the death and forensic report immediately? Tilak, is everything okay? Yes, sir, he has a perfect bunker built in the basement. Oh, God! ‐Nanda, cover him. ‐What's going on? ‐Sir, sir, sir, please go inside. Don't come out, go inside quick. We couldn't find any bullets. It's difficult to use them without proper training, Pon Manickavel, is a great gun specialist. Everyone of them was shot dead! Nothing else is common in the case. You won't understand, until you experience it You... Manickavel? How come you're here? What's happening? Has that old man arrived? Huh? Hey, say something. I've just sent you the list of 2009 batch from IDA training. Please check you email. Badrinath! Even if the sinner tries to evade everyone... can't escape the clutches of the God. In one case, brother of the accused killed him. In another case, the accused got killed by his enemy. God won't appear for anything and everything. Instead sends avatars of himself. And the third committed a suicide If not... he might appear as Manickavel too. Hey, hey... please don't kill me! Brother, please kill them. Hey, hey, hey... ‐No! ‐Shoot them, sir. "No other girl should endure what I went through." ‐No... ‐Shoot them, sir. Sir! I did try to catch the old man alive... but he... shot down, Badrinath and was going to shoot me. As a precaution... I had to shoot him down. ‐Brilliant job, Manickavel. ‐Thank you, sir. ‐Call the ambulance and clear the body. ‐Congratulations. Well done! Sir, my name is Nasrathullah. Sir, I got a threatening message from an unknown number. Okay, I'll be right there. What's your car number? Why do you have to do it? I want to kill them with my bare hands. Manickavel, from now on Tilak is in‐charge of this case. Badri, any issues? Even if there's a single small issue... there's my personal guest house for safety. My underground lair, I'll go there. Even if the God plans to appear, can't do squat about it. Brother, I need a corpse with O+ve matching his body type. I've made all the arrangements you might require at Mangalore. Sister, you can continue your course out there. Thank you, brother. What's wrong with you? Best of luck! Congrats, Pon Manickavel, sir You cleverly erased all the evidence. But that's not the end of the story. I'll get hold of at least one evidence. And arrest you before I retire from the service. Best of luck! Keep gawking, I'll buy you chickpeas. It's true that Police Department does its duty. But who do they serve? Is it for the department? Or for the politicians? Or do they serve the public? I got a reply for that question in spur of that moment To which my conscience supports... I'll lean towards it in accordance to the truth... in accordance to righteousness I will perform my duties until my last breath. So it's just a beginning. Long way to devil's road!
