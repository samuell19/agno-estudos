[music playing] I'm telling you, Alex, we've been here for three years now. We haven't met any of our goals. International business takes time. When Winray first went to Japan, it lost money for seven straight years. Now, most people think Winray's a Japanese company. Now, that's success. I wish I could be so confident. Why can't ya? Because I'm here. I'm the one who takes all the heat. You jet down here once or twice a month, have a few dinners, then go back to your five bedroom in suburbia. LINDA: I don't really care what her name is. You think I care? My business requires me to talk to people. I meet people. I--I go out and-- But you lied! You lied. - There's no lying. - You cheated on me. You're trying to say that you just had a drink with her? You're lying! MARCEL: Linda, I am tired of these games and accusations. Well, if you're tired of it, just leave. Leave, Marcel. Leave. Just get the fuck outta here. What was that all about? I think he told her, uh, that he's tired of her jealousy and her games. Then I don't know what he said, so-- Young and in love. What passion. Well, wait till you get to be my age. What are you complaining about, anyway? I've seen your wife. Yeah, we just had a baby six months ago. Well, congratulations. Yeah, thanks. It's-- It's wonderful. I don't know. There seems to be something missing now that we have a baby. You mean sex? Things will get back to normal. ALEX: She's very beautiful. They all are down here. It's one of the problems. Well, listen, I think we've, uh, sufficiently bored one another. I'm going back to the hotel. Coming? No, I think I'll stay here for a bit and have another drink. Good night. Be good. Yeah. [non-english speech] LINDA: I can't understand a thing you're saying. [non-english speech] You don't have to yell. Please just let me-- [non-english speech] OK, OK. Jeez. I--I swear I have money at home. Please just let-- [non-english speech] Is there a problem here? Yeah, my friend walked out and left me with the bill. I don't have any money, and I'm trying to convince this guy to let me go home and get some. He's afraid I won't come back. Well, why don't you let me help you out? No, that's OK. Please. You can, uh, pay me back tomorrow or something. I'm Linda. I'm Alex. OK, but only if you let me pay you back tonight. [non-english speech] Where are you staying? I'll go home and get the money. Uh, well, why don't you let me give you a ride home? It'll save you the trip. Trust me. I'm a nice guy. I know that. What do you say? Let's go. [music playing] Make yourself at home. I'll be right back. It's a nice place you have here. LINDA: Thanks. Do you live alone? LINDA: Yeah. Here's your money. Oh, why don't you let me treat you? It seems like you haven't had the greatest night. Don't be silly. I owe you this. [music playing] Well, I guess I'll be going. Good night. Wait. Yes? How about a cup of coffee? Well, I've already had a couple of cups tonight, but I guess one more wouldn't hurt. OK. I'll go make it. [music playing] You know, I just realized something. What's that? We've been sitting here for the last hour just talking about our jobs and this and that. We haven't asked each other the obvious. I'm not sure I understand you. How come you haven't asked me about the man I was arguing with in the restaurant? Oh, I was curious, but I didn't see a ring on your finger. So I assumed he's your boyfriend? His name is Marcel. He's my fiancee. I took the ring off when he left. Well, did you want to talk about him? There's not much to say really. I can't prove it, but I know he's having an affair. How can you tell? I can tell by the way he kisses me, the way he looks into my eyes, and by the way he touches me when we make love. You sound like a very perceptive woman. I am. I don't see a ring on your finger, but I can sense there's someone in your life. Well, I'm married. I took my ring off when I saw you. Why would you do a thing like that? Well, I don't know if women are the same as men in this way, but I wanted to see if I could get you to talk to me. And I figured if you saw a ring that you'd be turned off. Most men would have lied. You know, I don't know a lot of foreign languages, but I believe Linda means beautiful in Spanish. [music playing] I want to make love to you, Alex. Before we do, promise me one thing. Anything. Promise me we'll enjoy it for what it is, and then we won't examine each other's motives. [music playing] [knocking on door] What do you want? The hell is going on here? I told you to stop bothering me. How can I? I love you. You got my letter. You know how I feel. [music playing] I have to hear it out of your mouth. I won't believe it until I hear you say it. Say what? Tell me you don't love me anymore. [music playing] Please just leave. I don't want to hurt you. We loved each other, Linda. I--I mean, I admit there were some problems, but it was because we loved each other so passionately. I never knew what love was until now. What do you mean? I don't love you anymore. I love someone else. I'm so sorry. [music playing] I want to come with you. No, you can't I have to explain things to Maddy. She's gonna be crushed. How long, then? A couple of weeks. This is our last night together. I don't know how I'm gonna live without you. This isn't gonna be easy for me, either. [music playing] [sobbing] [music playing] What's wrong? Nothing. What do you mean? You don't look yourself. Something's different. It's funny how well you know me in such a short time. I know this is our last night together for a while, Alex. I want us to enjoy it. Can't help but feel sad. I feel like I'm never gonna see you again. You're not gonna get rid of me that easily. This thing between us has become far more than I ever imagined it could be. Well, I feel the same way. I really mean it, Alex. I never dreamed I'd be saying this to you this soon, but I love you. I love you no matter what. What about your fiancee? I can never be with him after being with you. I want to be with you, Alex. Every day. All the time. Then that's what you'll have. Promise me we'll be together forever. I promise. [music playing] [sobbing] [music playing] Hi. Hey. What are you doing home so early? I caught an earlier flight. Why didn't you call me? You know I'd love to pick you up at the airport. Oh, I--I didn't want to bother you. It's no bother. You know that. What's the matter? Jet lag, I guess. Uh, I--I'm just gonna go upstairs and lie down for a while if that's all right? Sure. [baby crying] [music playing] MARCEL (OVER PHONE): Hello, this is Marcel. I'm not home right now, so leave message, and I'll get back to you soon. Have a good day. Please, Marcel. If you're there, please pick up the phone. [music playing] Please. Marcel, I really need you. [music playing] [linda screaming] [music playing] [police sirens] Honey, are you OK? What do you mean? Oh, no, you just seem strange today. You didn't eat much at dinner. I think it's all this traveling getting to me. [crickets chirping] [music playing] What's all this? Just thought we should get back into the groove of things. [music playing] [phone ringing] Hello? LINDA (OVER PHONE): Hello, Alex? Is that you? Why are you calling so late? I can't believe what you did. Can't this wait till tomorrow at the office? She's there, isn't she? I want you to talk to me right now, or I'm gonna call back and tell her everything. All right, if you insist, but I--I think that file is downstairs, though. Hold on a second. It's some pain in the ass client. He says it's an emergency. I'll be right back. [music playing] What the hell are you doing? How could you do this to me? I have a family. I never meant to hurt you. I enjoyed the time we spent together, but I wasn't thinking of my responsibilities then. When I woke up this morning, it dawned on me just what I would be leaving. You told me you love me, and that we'd always be together. I meant everything I said when I said it. It's not as simple for me. I hate you, you son of a bitch. You're a liar and a murderer. Murderer? Now you're really not making any sense. You killed him, and you killed me. ALEX (ON PHONE): Are you drunk? You son of a bitch! Look, Linda, I'm sorry it had to turn out this way. I'll call you tomorrow when you've come to your senses and try to explain a little better. You lying bastard! A note? You leave me a note? You tell me love me, and then you leave me a note? All right, that's it. This discussion is over, and don't try to call back because I'm taking the phone off the hook. [music playing] Is everything all right? Yeah, everything is just fine. [music playing] MR. GATES: I want to congratulate everyone here on one of the most successful quarters we've seen since the mid-80s. It appears that every department is really starting to come along. Special praise goes out to Alex Madison, who, from what I can see, is doing a spectacular job in establishing a foothold in Louisiana. We're making a lot of money there. You're all doing great. Keep at it. Let's get to it. You bastard. I mean what I said, Alex. I'm really proud of you. Thank you very much. MR. GATES: Now, what about that pretty wife of yours? Well, she's fine. She asks about you all the time. Well, tell her I said hello. I'm looking forward to meeting your new son, too. He's looking forward to meeting you also. You're in my seat. They just love you down south, don't they? Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. MARK: What do you mean? What's up? What is it, Alex? I met a woman, and I had an affair. Is that all? The way you looked, I thought it was something serious. It is serious! I love my wife. Nobody said you didn't. Look, you were down in New Orleans. The sun was shining. The girls were topless. You're a good-looking guy. It's to be expected. Cut it out. It wasn't like that. It wasn't just sex. She told me she loved me. I told her I cared about her. Heat of the moment. You say something you don't mean. It happens. Well, she called my house last night. What? How'd she get your phone number? I don't know. She sounded crazy. Get an unlisted number. Problem solved. Yeah. Yeah, I guess you're right. Thanks, buddy. What are friends for? Now get out of my seat. [music playing] Actually, here he is right now. Yeah, OK. I got to go. OK. Bye. [music playing] Hi. Hey. How was your day? Fine. Yeah, I don't know what it is with me lately. I'm still not feeling myself,. No? I was kind of hoping you'd be in a good mood. Why? I got something to ask you. Two somethings, actually. OK. First off, my brother wants to come stay with us this summer. I don't think that's such a good idea right now. No? Well, he's kind of getting here tomorrow. All right. Well, we'll deal with it. What's the other thing? I'm going back to work. What? Where's all this coming from? Look, I--I don't mean to spring it on you all of a sudden. I've been thinking about this for a while now. Well, I thought you wanted to stay home with Matthew for a few years? I did. I just-- I miss working. I love being a mom, but I--I need something else. Same as you. It's not the same thing. Matthew's still a baby. I know. I've contacted an Au Pair service. For a reasonable price, they-- they come into your house, and they provide around-the-clock care. Who? Who comes into our house? Someone we don't even know? The nannies are thoroughly screened by the service. Trust me, Alex. I've thought a lot about this. Obviously. [crickets chirping] Hi. [music playing] I know I kind of knocked you for a loop today. I'm sorry. No. I'm sorry I snapped at you. I do love you. [music playing] All right, honey, listen. I have a job interview at 10, and then I'm screening potential nannies this afternoon. And Byron is due to arrive around dinnertime. You got it? Yeah. Then I gotta go upstairs and finish getting ready. I'd really like it if you could, uh, be here in time for dinner with my brother. I'll do my best. Love you. I love you, too. Sup? How was your trip? Rotten. I'm starving. I ran out of money in Las Vegas. Only had enough for gas. Where's Maddy? Taking a nap. Kid of yours can really scream. Yeah, he'll be wearing someone else out soon. She's going back to work, and we're gonna have to end up hiring a nanny. I know. She had a cattle call this afternoon. Well, how'd they look? Basically they fell into two categories, old battle axes that scared the hell out of Matthew or strange looking young girls that smelled bad and looked like they just defected from Russia. Nobody has to defect from Russia anymore. Why not? Because it's no longer a communist country. What do you know? When's dinner? How's pizza? You're sounding like a bachelor now! Right. No, no, no, that's not what I meant. I just thought we had that taken care of. No, I heard you. I understand. All right, are you sure? What time? Well, [inaudible] not gonna like this. Like what? Nothing. I'll tell you later. Your brother here was hungry, so I figured we'd better get him something to eat. Did you have a tough day? Yeah. All this being interviewed and interviewing people, it's harder than I thought. How'd it go? Well, I can start my job whenever I want, but as far as potential nannies go, um, there's a couple I kinda liked. Well, you don't sound so sure. MADDY: Maybe it's just cold feet. I-- I need your help on this, Alex. There's a couple coming tomorrow, and I'd really like for you to be there. Well, I guess I better tell you about this phone call right now then. What? I have to leave town again. You just got back. When? Tonight. I'm taking a red eye back to New York. I really need your help on this, Alex. I know. Listen, maybe it's better this way. I can't do this alone. Well, maybe Byron here can make himself useful for once. Byron, you don't mind helping your sister out on this one, do you? What? See? He'll be great. Listen, I gotta go run upstairs and pack. [music playing] Can I help you? I need to speak to Mrs. Madison. What about? It's personal. Come on in. Hold on. I'll go get her. Hey, Maddy. Some chick here to see you. MADDY: I'll be right down. She's probably from the Au Pair service. She didn't say. Oh, hi. Come on in. Hi. Are you Mrs. Madison? Please, call me Maddy. Take a seat. I just, uh, I think I should tell you that I interviewed 10 nannies yesterday, and I wasn't happy with any of them. So if you don't get the job, it's not you. It's just I'm having trouble parting with this little guy. The job? Yeah, the job. May I hold him? Oh, of course. Hi. It's OK. I think he likes you. I think he does, too. This has been such a good morning. I feel the same way. I don't know what it is, but I feel like we know each other. Matthew seems to like you. I have to be honest with you right now. There's a few more people I need to see, but I can't see myself giving the job to anyone else. How soon could you start? I could start today. Oh, well there's-- there's still a few more people I need to see, but, uh, how's tomorrow? Really? Yeah. I'll be here bright and early. Thanks so much. I'll see you then. Bye. Hi. Are you here for the nanny job? I sure am. Don't waste your time. I was just in there. The job's been filled. Are you sure? Yeah. OK. Thank you. No trouble. [music playing] [police sirens] Alex, I said no cheese. You got some color back in your face. Yeah, thanks. I guess I'm feeling a little bit better, but you know, at times, it seems just when everything's back in order, something else pops up. Obviously, you're referring to something specific. Maddy wants to go back to work. MARK: So? I don't know. Maybe it's just me, but that whole thing that went down in New Orleans, you know, I mean-- I feel bad about it. Like I deserve to be punished or something. Hey, you had some fun. You got away with it. Just try to relax. ALEX: See, that's the thing. I can't relax. I need some time to come to terms with all this, but I can't let my life slow down long enough to do it. Well, what are you saying? You want to leave Maddy? No, of course not. I love her. We just had a child, for Christ's sake. You should see the way that woman looks at me. You know, she thinks I'm the greatest thing that's ever happened to her, and I go out and cheat on her. Alex, look. You made a mistake. It's in the past. It's over. Just do what you can to make it up to her and stop worrying about it. That doesn't do anybody any good. Yeah. As usual, you're right. Of course I'm right. Now eat your food. [music playing] [crickets chirping] Hi, Maddy. Hi. I'm all done with the kitchen now. If there's nothing else, I'm gonna go-- go ahead and go to bed. Of course. You've done more than enough. The kitchen looks great. Thanks. Well, goodnight. Is everything all right? Yeah. Fine. You know, I was just thinking I'm really pleased how well things worked out with you. Thank you. Linda, I know you work for me, but I want you to feel free to think of us as friends. I moved out here with Alex because of his job, and I don't know a lot of people out here. And I'd really like to have someone that I could trust and talk to. You can't do that with your husband? Well, no, I--I can. It's just he's a man, and he's busy, and I need someone other than my husband as a friend. And I don't want you to let the fact that you work for me get in the way of that. I think that'd be nice. Goodnight. Goodnight. [music playing] Maddy? Hi. What's with the place? What? It's so clean. I can't wait for you to meet her, Alex. She is perfect. You're just gonna love her. You found the one? She's a million times better than I ever expected. Matthew loves her. Byron loves her. I love her. Well, then, I'm sure I'll love her, too. Come on. Where is she? Linda, come here. I want you to meet Alex. [music playing] Very nice to meet you, Mr. Madison. [music playing] Not a word. What the hell do you think you're doing? I'm your new housekeeper. Don't bullshit me! What are you doing here? Make love to me. You must be nuts. I want you out of here right now! No! Make love to me. Now. You used me, Alex, and then you tossed me out like a piece of trash. Now, I'm going to use you. Take off your clothes. Look, I don't know who the hell you think-- No more talking! Take off your clothes, or I'm gonna go upstairs and tell Maddy everything. She wouldn't believe it. I have proof. The note you wrote me when you left. Love me like you did when we were together. I don't love you! Watch it. I'm the boss here. Don't forget it. You'll do as I say, or I will ruin your life. Trust me. Now take off your clothes. [music playing] I am looking forward to this weekend with you. Good morning. Alex. Good morning. Sorry I'm late. Oh, don't worry about it. How'd everything go in New York? Very well. Good. Listen, I need to talk to you for a few seconds. Can we step into your office? Of course. Are you sure you're feeling OK? You look a little pale. I think I'm just a little jet lagged from the trip. Of course. Listen, I've got this big wig from Japan flying in unexpectedly. OK. His name is Mr. Tushima. OK. Well, if we can close a deal with him, it'd be huge. Well, what can I do? I'd like to entertain him at your home. I'd do it myself, but my house is being renovated. What? It won't be anything big, just a few for dinner. Can I count on you and your wife to schmooze Mr. Tushima. Well, sure. Great. Honey, how's this? It's fine. Well, how about this? It's fine. Which one? It doesn't matter! Is everything OK? Everything is fine. I'm just getting sick of you always asking me that all the time. What am I supposed to do? You've been acting so strange lately. I'm supposed to go back to work tomorrow, and I'm not gonna be able to do this if I'm still feeling guilty about you! There's nothing wrong! I just need to rest. [door opening] [music playing] What the hell do you think you're doing? I expected you to make an appearance in my room tonight. All right, fine. But no more coming into my bedroom. What if she had woken up? I guess that would've been a tough situation for you. Lucky you woke up when you did. I was about to get in bed with you. I would have killed you. Oh, I'm scared. [music playing] You are one crazy bitch. That's it! Fuck you! [music playing] Hi. Hi. How are you feeling? Oh, nervous. Glad I'm ready, though. Oh, listen. I need you to be free for a dinner party later this week. MADDY: Oh, what's up? Mr. Gates wants to entertain a Japanese client here. Just tell me when. Thanks. MADDY: Bye, sweetie. Bye. Bye, Byron. Bye. [music playing] [knocking on door] Hi. What are you doing looking in my window at night? What are you doing fucking my brother-in-law? You know, I can't help but notice that you're always eating, and you spend an awful lot of time all alone in this room. What do you mean? I think you're a very frustrated young man, Byron because there's something missing in your life, so you compensate in other ways. Is this what you like to do? Look at these magazines, and eat, and peep in through my window? No. You're a little pervert, aren't you? Wouldn't you like someone else to touch it besides you? [music playing] This is what a real woman looks like, Byron. [music playing] Touch me. [music playing] I know you've been dreaming of doing this. [music playing] Tell me what your fantasy is, Byron. This. This is my fantasy. What do you want me to do to you? Anything you want. [music playing] Sorry to interrupt, Alex. What is it, Mark? Well, two things, a message and a favor. Yeah? Mr. Gates called from San Francisco this morning. You weren't here. He told me to tell you that this thing with Mr. Tushima is going down tomorrow night. What? I know. He said he was sorry for the late notice, but he's sure you can handle it. Jesus Christ, he must be crazy. Not now. Any time but now. Maddy just started her new job, for Christ's sake. Well, I guess this isn't a great time to ask for a favor, then. What is it? I want to be there. ALEX: Where? The dinner with Mr. Tushima. Why would you want to come? You'll be busy entertaining. Mr. Gates'll have a few drinks, we'll talk, I'll be impressive. I'll be in the inside track to take over your job when you get promoted. Promoted? That's the word. You're moving up. He's creating a new position just for you. You're gonna be his right-hand man. I got to start planning this thing. So what do you say? About what? The dinner. Yeah, yeah. You're invited. Get out of here. Yes. BYRON: God, I can't tell you how long I've dreamed of being with you. Why didn't you do something? I don't know. Scared, I guess. I would be, too. Can I ask you something? You want to know why I was with Alex. Linda, please tell me. When I moved in here, Alex saw me, and he came on to me. I told him I wasn't interested, but he forced himself on me. He told me if I didn't have sex with him, that he would send me away. That bastard. I know. I didn't have a choice. I can't go back. I'll help you, OK? I won't let him do that to you anymore. Please, don't say anything, or I just know he'll send me away. Don't worry about it. [matthew crying] I have to check on the baby. ALEX (ON PHONE): Yeah, I know you just started today, but I need you on this. This is huge. Well, why don't you call Linda and ask her to help? What does she know about planning a dinner party? Mr. Gates thinks you're the greatest thing since sliced bread. I need you on this. All right, listen. I'll call Linda, and I'll tell her to do everything that I usually do. Good. I love you. [crickets chirping] [music playing] What's with the fancy dinner? Oh, Linda wants the practice for tomorrow night. What's tomorrow night? My boss is coming over for dinner along with Mr. Tushima, a Japanese client we're trying to do business with. It's, uh, super important. So I take it I'm not invited. Correct. All right, this is it. Let's eat. [music playing] This is delicious, Linda. [music playing] Come in. Shut the door. [music playing] Linda, did Maddy tell you everything about tonight? Yeah, I got it all. Great. Please remember how important this is. Everything has to be perfect. I have to go to work. Please tell Maddy to call me at the office. How can you stand taking orders from that phony asshole? Maddy, what's wrong? What do you mean? BYRON: You look awful. Thanks. I feel awful. I don't know what it is. Wait a second. [music playing] So what are you doing today? I don't know. Thought I might go to the beach. Thanks. [music playing] How is it? Oh, thanks. It feels a little better. I've got to go to work. Alex told me to tell you to call him at the office. He seems nervous about tonight. I know. Jet lag. All right, guys. See you later. [music playing] [matthew cooing] [music playing] Linda. LINDA (OVER PHONE): What do you want? How's everything coming? Great. The place looks beautiful. The food's almost ready. Did you tell Maddy to call me? Yes, I did. ALEX (ON PHONE): Well, I just checked my messages, and she hasn't. That's your problem, isn't it? Look, Linda, I've been carting Mr. Tushima around all day. Do me a favor and tell Maddy to call me. I'm on the cellular. I got it. What are you so worried about? I just want to make sure she knows that dinner is at 6:00 now instead of 7:00. OK, I'll call you right back. Yes, Mrs. Madison, please. SECRETARY (OVER PHONE): She's not in. Well, when can I reach her? SECRETARY (OVER PHONE): Actually, she had a problem this morning. She fainted and had to be rushed to the hospital. I'm her housekeeper. Why wasn't I contacted? SECRETARY (OVER PHONE): The last I heard, she was unconscious and unable to call and make anyone aware of the emergency. She just started, so she hasn't filled out the paperwork. All right. Thank you. [music playing] Byron. What? I have to run an errand. Will you watch the baby while I'm gone? Where are you going? Forgot to get something for tonight. OK. OK. [music playing] What happened? You're sick. Doctors don't know what the problem is. Where's Alex? He told me to tell you he'll be here as soon as he can, but he's got to take care of Mr. Tushima first. Oh, god, the dinner. Don't worry about it. He'll be here as soon as he can. I really need him to be here with me, Linda. I know. Why don't you get some rest? [phone ringing] Hello? Is she there yet? LINDA (OVER PHONE): We can't find her anywhere, Alex. I can't get through to her office. God damn it. She knows how important this is to me. Don't worry about it. Everything's fine here. The dinner's going to be delicious. ALEX (ON PHONE): All right, fine. Keep trying to get in touch with her. If she doesn't show, then we're gonna have to go on without her. OK. Bye. Isn't that terrible? [music playing] MR. GATES: I've heard so much about you and your company for so many years now. MR. TUSHIMA: I think it's a wonderful idea, Mr. Gates. MR. GATES: Thank you, sir. MR. TUSHIMA: I think we should proceed with this plan immediately. Good. Good. You see, I think the main thing is if we put together your sense, your knowledge and expertise with microchips and our company's ability to manufacture in quantity, we can-- we can make a serious dent in the world markets. When can we start? I would say within a week. I wanted you to get to know Alex really well because he's our man internationally. I'm very pleased to hear that. I'm very sorry about Maddy. I don't know what could have happened to her. Well, let's just hope it's nothing serious. Looks like you've whipped up quite a spread here. Thank you. Perhaps the lady would like to join us? I think that's an excellent idea, Mr. Tushima. Linda? I'd be delighted. [music playing] MR. GATES: Alex. Why didn't you tell me you hired such a charming creature to take care of Matthew? Well, look. She's got it all. Funny, intelligent, beautiful, a fantastic cook. Wait until you taste dessert before you make any final decisions. Alex, I would like to thank you for a wonderful night. I agree with Mr. Gates. It was a pleasure to have this young leader entertaining us tonight. [phone ringing] I'll get it. [music playing] Hello? DOCTOR (OVER PHONE): Yes, this is Mrs. Madison's doctor. Is Mr. Madison in please? One second. [music playing] He's not available at the moment. This is their housekeeper. DOCTOR (OVER PHONE): We've kept an eye on her for the day, and she appears to be fine now. We think it was a mild case of food poisoning. I'm glad she's all right. DOCTOR (OVER PHONE): She's ready to go home just as soon as you send someone down to pick her up. That sounds fine. I'll try and get in touch with Mr. Madison as soon as I can. DOCTOR (OVER PHONE): We'll be expecting your call. Thanks. Bye. [music playing] Excuse me. [music playing] Can I help you with anything? No, I'm fine. I hope you don't think I'm being too forward by saying this, but you're one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen. Why would I think that? I'm flattered. Well, a lot of women would question my motives in being so blunt. I don't understand. A lot of women would think that I only wanted to get them in bed with me. Get into bed with you? Well, yeah. Tonight? Well, yeah. I think we can arrange something. Oh yeah? [music playing] I had a wonderful time, Mark. She's some cook, huh? Oh, she's fantastic. That went very well, Alex. You really came through. Thank you, Mr. Gates. And Linda, you were incredible tonight. A superwoman. What do you think? Well, thank you for helping me through that tonight. Now take off my wife's dress. I have something I have to tell you. What? Maddy's in the hospital. What? She's fine. The doctor said it was just something she ate. Well, why didn't you tell me? I couldn't. It would have ruined the dinner. Who cares? That's my wife! Then perhaps you should go pick her up. I--I can't believe you. I--I know you hate me, but Maddy? I only did what I thought you would have wanted me to do. Maddy's fine, and the dinner was a success. [music playing] Maddy. Where were you? Man, you smell like cheap wine. I didn't know what had happened. Linda just told me. How was the dinner? Fine. Don't worry about that. Are you OK? I'm fine. I just-- just something I ate. Maddy, I want to get rid of Linda. She deliberately didn't tell me about you being sick. Why? She said she thought it might ruin the dinner. Whatever. Look, everything got screwed up today. But I'm fine, and the dinner went fine. So let's just go home and get some rest. OK? OK. [music playing] [lighter lights] That was great. Yeah, I needed to get that out of my system. You know, I came to dinner tonight to schmooze old man Gates, but when I saw you, I couldn't take my eyes off ya. You're a very passionate man. So how'd you come to work for Alex? I met Alex in New Orleans. We were in love. What? We were in love, but then he left. He lied to me. You had an affair with Alex? Alex Madison? Yes. He was on business in New Orleans. I broke off my engagement, then my fiance killed himself. How did you wind up here? What? I mean-- I mean, you didn't come here all the way to be with him. I don't want to talk about this anymore! It just seems strange that-- I'm leaving now. Wait! You don't have to go! It's just-- It's strange. Why don't you shut the fuck up? [music playing] Oh my god. It's her. She's the one. [door slams] Alex, I have to talk to you. What is it. I fucked your housekeeper last night. What? Linda? Yeah I-- I don't know if she's telling the truth or what's going on, but man, she's psycho. What did she say to you? She said you had an affair with her, and then you left her. This isn't the woman from New Orleans, is it? Yes, it is. Jesus. So now she's here? Yeah. She came when I was out of town. Maddy hired her as a housekeeper. How the hell did she find you? I don't know. She must have seen my wallet or something. You better get rid of her before it's too late. What do you mean? Think about it. She's home alone with your wife and kid? God knows what the hell she's capable of. Oh my god. [music playing] LINDA: You're so handsome. So cute. You just love me, don't you? You're gonna love having me as your mommy. I would, too. If anything terrible ever happened to your mommy, I'd take care of you. Just like I do now. [music playing] Hi, honey. What are you doing home from work so early? Where's Linda? Uh, she's in her room dressing the baby. [music playing] - What's wrong? - You. You're what's wrong. I want you out of here right now. Fine, but before I go, there's one thing I have to tell Maddy. I don't care. Do what you have to do. Just get it over with, and get out of my house. All right, but can I ask you what brought this on so suddenly? We seemed to be working things out. I just talked to Mark. He made me realize what a nut you really are. [music playing] [matthew cooing] [music playing] Do what you have to do. [matthew cooing] MADDY: Alex! What's wrong? Linda just told me that she caught Byron peeping through her window last night while she was undressing. Is that so? I want you to talk to him about it. I have to go to work. [music playing] Hey, Mark. So what happened? Everything's under control. You got rid of her? No. No, I couldn't. Maddy was there. So what are you gonna do? I don't know. I'll think of something. Listen, do you want to go out and get a drink? Oh, I gotta stay here late and finish this report for the old man, but I'll see you tomorrow, huh? OK. Hey. Just remember what I told you. OK. [crickets chirping] [music playing] What are you doing here? What's this about telling Alex I'm nuts? I don't know what you're up to. Alex is my best friend. If you came all the way up here from New Orleans to terrorize him and his family, yeah, I'd say you were nuts. You want to see nuts? No, hey, wait a minute. Don't! Now that's nuts. [music playing] [phone ringing] Hello. SECRETARY (OVER PHONE): Alex, something terrible's happened at the office. What? SECRETARY (OVER PHONE): Someone came in and shot Mark while he was sitting at his desk. He's dead. Oh my god. Honey, what's wrong? SECRETARY (OVER PHONE): I know it's terrible. I'm here with the police right now. I need you to come down here. I'm on my way. Mark's been shot. I've got to get down there right away. Jesus, is he all right? He's dead. [music playing] [mark grunting] Jesus! [mark grunting] MADDY: What do you mean he's not there yet? He left here over an hour ago. I can't believe this. No, it's not fine. I don't know where he could be. Well, I'm sure he's fine. MADDY: Well, no one fitting his description checked into any of the area hospitals. And I spoke with the police, and they're gonna track his route for accidents. [door opening] That's it! Honey, what happened? [music playing] I have something to tell you, and I just want you to listen. I had an affair with Linda when I was in New Orleans. I said a few things I didn't mean. Look, I understand if you want to leave me, but what's more important right now is that we get rid of her. She just tried to kill me! She rigged my brakes! She-- she's been poisoning you, and I have a good feeling that she just killed Mark! Honey, what are you saying? You're a liar! What? She didn't rig your brakes. I did. Excuse me? I love her. She is not the problem. You are! You conniving, evil bitch! [music playing] No! Alex, stop it! [music playing] Stop it! [music playing] Get off her! [music playing] MADDY: Alex, you're gonna kill her! [music playing] Alex, you're gonna kill her! For God's sake, stop! [police sirens] Alex, stop it! Alex, stop! Freeze! Back up and just move away. Now! Honey just do like he says, OK? OFFICER: Don't do anything you'll regret. [music playing] Drop the gun! I loved you, Alex. Look what you made me do. OFFICER: Drop it! MADDY: Oh my god. Oh my god. Honey. Honey. Honey, are you OK? Yeah. Yeah, I'm OK. Oh god. Oh god. Honey, the baby. [music playing] Honey. Honey, listen to me. I can't find the baby. Honey, I can't find the baby. Where's the baby? Honey, what did she do to my baby? [music playing] Where's the baby? [music playing] Where's my baby? [music playing]
