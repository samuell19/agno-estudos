[CAR ENGINE REVVING] Naturally, this whole thing it is very personal. ANNOUNCER: It involves the driver, his car, and an intangible mixture of the two called speed. And when that mixture is happening, nothing or no one else exists. Excepting, of course, the other drivers, that they're just in a way. JOE JOE: When I'm too old to race... You mean, when I'm too old to drive. You can always race. Even I'll crush this. I'll be grand champion of the blind staggers.

[CAR ENGINE ROARING] ANNOUNCER: With just over 14 laps to run... No one else involved, he's not going to hit the rail. So, he'll probably be able to restart. So, he's lost two places in about eight seconds. Ah, that's really too bad. He's driving extremely well out there. 1:25:9 the best race lap so far. Oh, there's a crash, there's a crash. Right into the hay! I'm sorry, I don't know who it is. It is a red car. No report from that end yet, but there's an ambulance there on the course. White flag. We were just talking about the high average speed. Well, this will probably slow things down for a lap or two. No, this still looks like it's going to be the fastest race ever. What did he say about Joe Joe? The race situation has certainly changed. Oh, we've just heard it was Norman. It was Jeff Norman in the McLaren that crashed. No details yet. The ambulance is still there. Probably, probably not serious. There are a few pieces of metal lying here and there on the track, which makes a bit dodgy there until they get it cleared off. Geoffrey laps himself. Still lapping on the 1:25. I think he had a little trouble getting down into third gear. Here's a nasty curve. Maybe some gear box trouble. Maybe the same old story for Quillico, mechanical trouble. Now on the last lap, and it's going to be Pico's race after all. Quillico still running, but he's dropped back now. He's dropped back. It'd really been miraculous if he can make that gear box start. With his surprisingly smooth driving today, a break down now would really be rotten luck. [ENGINE REVVING] Well, we seem to have the trouble sorted out now. Quillico has lost his middle gears, which means he must risk burning out his brakes entering the turns, and has no acceleration coming out. So, he has one chance left to press on as hard as possible, in hopes that his two lap lead will give him just enough space and time to hold off and go to the finish. Pico has past Quillico and taken the lead. Pico in the lead, Joe Joe clinging to second. He should be able to keep it in the remaining seconds. But there's yet another accident! Another one gets hit. It's either Gardner or Tilbert. Right in front of Quillico. Here come Joe Joe, here he comes now. He got through alright. So ends another Dutch Grand prix. Exciting as ever, bestowing nine championship awards on Shawn Ellaine Pico, who ran hard and really deserved his win. In the books, that's all that counts. But today's drama was played out by smiling Joe Joe Quillico, the red hot Yankee who started in front with the fastest car on the track, and stayed there with the ease and a nose cone. He had the race right in his hip pocket until mechanical difficulties forced him to run the last lap... -Are you alright? -Yeah, I'm alright. -What happened? -I lost the race.
