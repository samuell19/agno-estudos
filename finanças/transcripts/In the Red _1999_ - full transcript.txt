I missed him. - Sweetheart, are you okay? - Yeah. Are you okay? I'm sorry, baby. Here's some money. Where did you get this? (Carli laughs) You are (mumbles). Oh. (siren blares) - Take a seat, Mr. Hand. - You watch it. - Okay. - Welcome, Mr. Hand. I'm Detective Blondine Dimaggio, and this here is my-- - I know who this idiot is. - Now I have to say, this is your lucky day, Mr. Hand. It's Jack, isn't it? - Yeah. - Today, you could change your life, Jack. - What are you talking about? - You know you're in cubic shitloads up to your neck, Jack. - I wanna talk to my lawyer. - [Peter] Your what? - [Jack] I wanna see my lawyer. - [Peter] You wanna see your lawyer. - Who? (officer mumbles) How do you know? - You know, Jack, some people are born lucky. Others like yourself are living proof that God hasn't got any quality control. - Whoa, Jack, trying to move up on the vermin scale, eh. - [Jack] What? - Looks like you and I are after the same person, only I'm not sending out idiots to try and shoot him for me. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Jack, I've just heard a report from one of my surveillance teams that your messenger just went clay pigeon shooting and didn't even get a score. - Well, scumbag, we've got you by the balls. So before you go off screaming for your lawyer, as much as it goes against my grain, I suggest you listen to what Blondine here has to say to you. From where you stand, this is the best chance you're gonna get. - Jack, there are three ways we can do this. One, we have enough evidence to charge you with dealing and attempted murder. Two, we could let Dymo know who was behind the attempt on his life and set you free. Or three, you can do what we say, and we'll let you walk at the end. You see, Jack, you're just a little fish in a murky pond. And sometimes I use little fish to catch bigger fish. Jack, you're on my hook. (Peter chuckles) - Nice ass. - You shut up. (doorbell rings) (upbeat music) - [Zed] Hey, Carli. - Zed. Zed! - Sorry. Great hair. - They destroyed my car. Yeah. Right. Yeah, well, whatever it takes. I want him found. Talk to you later. Hi, Zed. - How are you doing? - Not bad. - Got any clues? - Not yet. You heard anything? - Hey, Zeddy, you want a drink? - No, thanks, Carli. Pauly's taking your car, mate. We better go. - Yeah, sure. (mumbles) Okay. - Where's your flashy little shit box, Dymo? - We heard on the grapevine you might wanna report an incident. - What incident? - Oh, I don't know. What was it, Dash? - Uh, alien invasion, I think. Yeah. No, actually, someone told us that a martian came down, saw your little car, thought it was a spaceship and zapped it with his ray gun. - We thought we'd save you a trip to the police station, so we came here so you could make a statement. See, it's not true what they say about us. We are caring individuals. Aren't we, Dash? - Oh, yeah, caring. Care to watch your back, Dymo. You know, it's a dangerous game some people play. - We all know when we play games, someone wins and someone loses. - I don't play games. I play for keeps. - Oh, Dymo, you better believe it, so do I. So do I. - Smug shit. - Dash, just turn the car around. I'll go have a chat with the young lady. - [Peter] Right-o. ♪ Here we go again ♪ - So what the hell's going on? - Wish I knew, mate. Wish I knew. I gotta give Tuan a call. Do you mind? (phone dials) (phone rings) - Hello. - [Dymo] Tuan, Dymo. - Ah, Dymo. I was wondering when you would call. I hear you have small trouble. - You have more ears than days in a year, Tuan. - No, Dymo, only ears in very important places. - Yeah, well, I think we should meet and drink some tea. - Ah, tea. That's a very good idea. Tea resolves many ailments. - Yeah, well, I'm driving to the city now. It'll be about 45 minutes, I reckon. - Look forward to it. - See you then. - What did he say? - He reckons you can't drive for shit. - Twist on this, man. - No, seriously, Zed. If it's got wheels, you'll find a way of crashing it. I remember that time you drove the bloody bike into the river. If it wasn't for Bobbi and Slay, you'd still be lying down on the bottom. - That was a new pushy too. Geez, the old man was pissed off. Merry Christmas, eh. - Yeah, and who was it that roller bladed into the side of a bus. (Zed laughs) That bus driver thought for sure that he killed you. I mean, he was standing there just staring at you in disbelief that you were still alive. I thought you were dead. Bloody poor bastard didn't even realize he pissed his pants. - Okay, man (mumbles). - But you, Zed, are a classic, man, bloody classic. Bobbi. Yeah, get a hold of Slay and get him to meet us at the warehouse tonight at 7:30. Okay, man, see you then. ♪ Here we go again ♪ - I'm gonna get an extra 50 horsepower out of this straight up. - So what you're saying is that with the flick of a switch, the nitrous is introduced into the fuel at a greatly reduced temperature, and that, in turn, allows more fuel into the motor. - Yeah. More fuel-- - More power. - That's right. - So how long does a bottle of nitrous last? - Well, it depends. See, the way I've got this set up, it only comes into use once you hit mid throttle. And if you leave it on, you get a minute and a half out of the bottle. And that's burning rubber, my friend, burning rubber. - Burning rubber. Hey, Zed. - How you doing, man? - How you doing? - How you going? Where's your motor? - Upstairs. We need to talk. Yeah, yeah, all right. Uh-huh, okay. - Anything? - Zip. - So what's going on? - Someone took a hit at Dymo, shot up his motor. - Like who? - [Zed] We don't know yet, Slay. - Any word on the street? - Nothing yet. - Let's just say that somebody out there is not happy with the way we're doing business.

Apparently, US customs has tied up the South American route tight as a fish's ass. - And where do you fit into this deal, Jack? - Well, that's none of your business. However, as a sign of good faith, I got a little export deal going with New Zealand, mineral water. You know, that bottled shit that kids drink. Plus I do a bit of business with their affiliated gangs in the city. I got a good track record, Dymo.

What about one of these lovely girls? - No, thanks, Gordo, just business. - Business, yes. Well, there's been a slight situation. We had a bit of liquidity. But hey, just tell Dymo that business has been a bit slow in the last couple of months. Just all I need is a week or two to get back on track. - Listen, Gordo. You know as well as I do that's now how we operate. No money, no merchandise. - One fucking week. One fucking week! You tell Dymo I've got enough shit on him to sink a ship anytime I want! So one week's credit certainly isn't gonna hurt his precious fucking business! I hear there's someone else in town who doesn't quite like the way he does business. (chuckles) - I'll let him know how you feel, Gordo. - You fucking do that. (man and woman moan) (upbeat techno music) - So that's the setup but the big question is can you supply that much gear on such short notice. - That's not the question here, Jack. (phone rings) Zed. - [Dymo] Dymo, at the Slice of Heaven. Gordo wants to put a check in the mail. - Okay. Get on to Bobbi, and get him to pick me up at Decay. See you soon. Sorry, Jack, urgent business to take care of, man. - What, so you're in? - I'll think about it, get back to you. (upbeat techno music) (alarm blares) - Come on, hurry up! 15 seconds. Come on, move it. Every single phone here. (man grunts) Get me some jellybeans. 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Let's go! (siren blares) Shit. Hang on. (upbeat music) - [Slay] G'day, Gordo! - Guys, guys. No. (screams) Shit! Oh, no! (sobs) Dymo. No. - Gordo. - Dymo. No. Dymo. (Gordo screams) - [Man] Hey, Dymo. - Thanks. Is the storage full? - Yeah, to the brim. The last things in with the mobile phones. - And how many laptops from the night before? - 27 laptops and three PCs. But they're all English version, no Chinese. - Okay. Not a bad week's work, really. I suppose Sparky's not too unhappy about his new stock. Although if that's how they turn up looking, he wouldn't be too impressed. - It's not my fault. They just shouldn't let some people drive at night. - Okay, you guys better get out of here before you give me a bad name. - Hey, you give us a call with that order. - As soon as I get the new list. Talk to you then. - Dymo, check it out. I fitted a bigger turbo and tweaked up your nitro. It's running all right. (tires screech) - Sparky, if you were legal, you'd still make a fortune. - Legal? Quit fuckin' joking. Take all the fun out of life. Let's go, Pauly. (phone rings) - [Man] Dash, it's for you, line three. - Right-o. Hello, Detective Peter Dasha. Well, Jack, I suppose you better come and get some supplies then, haven't you? Jock, get the troops together for a briefing, mate. All right, you lot, listen up. I said listen up. We've got something pretty big about to go down, and I need you all to pay attention. Now as you all know, Blondine and I have been after this... You all right? - [Officer] Sorry. - I'll start again. Now as you all know, Blondine and I have been after this Dymo character and his cronies for a long time. As things have turned out, we've had some inside knowledge. We've been able to set up a deal that's gonna go down tonight. - You set it up, Dash? - Yesiree. In fact, we've been able to put the squeeze on Mr. Jack Hand so much that I've got him in my pocket. - It can't be too bloody big then, eh, Dash? (group laughs) - Come on, you guys. Oh, god, honestly! If I didn't know any better, I'd swear half of you were still in the schoolyard! You all know this Dymo character is one of the main men we've been after. He's the center pin for all sorts of crime, ram raids, car theft, drug deals. If it's illegal, he is into it. And what's more, he's the main man on the street for the Chinese crime syndicate in this town, so I cannot impress upon you the importance of this bust! - Then how come they put you in charge, Dash? - Oh, very funny. (officer chuckles) Now the deal's going down at 0500 at Jack Hand's factory. - Five in the morning? Shit, it's still dark there. - Well, of course, it is, you egg. Now the layout of the factory is like this. We'll have a dozen of you guys placed outside here, here, here, three more on the other side, and the remainder inside. Now Jack Hand will probably have a few of his lads with him. Blondine and I will be upstairs watching in the dark. Don't even think about it, sunshine. - Hey, Dasha, what about Dymo? - Well, I'd imagine he'll have his entire crew with him. Now there's four of them including Dymo. - [Man] Is that all? - Is that all? Look, these are not just any ordinary punks. They are shiftier than a shithouse rat. Now if there's nothing else, I'd imagine you all have some preparations to take. Oh, wait a second. One more thing. We, the police department, have put up $8 million of the city's money for this deal. Now if anything goes wrong, it's my ass that's on the line. - Can you insure an ass for eight million, Dash? (group laughs) - I'd advise you to get to work. (phone rings) - Yeah. - [Peter] Blondine, It's Dasha. We're on. - Who? - [Peter] It's Dasha, your partner. We're gonna spring Dymo. We can't set it up. - Yeah, okay, I'm on my way. - [Peter] So we gotta get you down here now, all right? - Sorry, gorgeous. Duty calls. (upbeat music) - [Man] Yeah, Jack, it's me. She's at the shopping mall. - [Jack] Typical. Keep an eye on her. I'm five minutes away. - [Man] Right-o. (woman sings in foreign language) (phone rings) Hello. - [Jack] She's still there? - [Man] Yeah, she's bought everything on the first floor. She's moved on to the second. - [Jack] I'm upstairs on the roof. - [Man] Yeah, we'll keep an eye on her. I'll let you know. - [Jack] Right-o. Speak to me. - [Man] She's still here, Jack. - [Jack] Where is she now? - [Man] Back on the first floor, spending money like it's going out of fashion. - [Jack] Christ, she's been in there two hours. - [Man] Yeah, tell me about it. Look, I'll call you back. - Oh, very nice. Oh, yes. I'll take it. Do you have this in a different color? - Yeah, we have blue, but why don't you try another hat. (Carli gasps) This is a beautiful one with black feathers. - Oh, gosh. Oh, I love it. - It's definitely you. - Oh, it's beautiful. What are these feathers? - I think they're ostrich, actually. - Oh, I've got to take it. - Okay, good. - [Carli] Have you got anything else? - [Man] Finally, I think she's finished. We're heading out. - [Jack] Okay, I'll give you the word to grab her. - [Man] Right-o. - Wait for my call. Fuck. - Doing a bit of shopping. (phone rings) - Yup. - Forget it. Forget about it. The chick she's with is a cop. You hear me? - [Man] Shit! - [Jack] Forget it. We'll pick her up later. - Okay. We're outta here. - What are you looking at, knucklehead? Just up here on the left. Thanks, driver. Keep the change. Have a good night. (Carli gasps) - [Man] Nice ass. - You fucking scumbag! Who the hell do you think you are? Have you boys got no respect for a lady? What, your mother never taught you any manners? Well, the rules, boys, are respect and manners! Dymo. - [Man] Fuck! You bitch! - I'm starving. - [Man] Shit! - [Bobbi] Nice one, boys. - There you go. - Dymo. - Oh, lovely lady. - Thank you. - Anything for you. Oh. - Thank you. So how was your day? - Oh, it was good. How about yours? (mumbles) - Good. - Mm-hmm. - Did you miss me? - Of course. Did you miss me? - Uh-huh. - I think it's time for a toast. - Okay. - Guys and girls, fuck life before life fucks you. - [Group] To life. - But seriously, guys, I have been approached to be involved in something that's, well, it's pretty big. - Ladies, shall we? - So I just wanted to toss around a few ideas, see what you guys thought. - So, what, you've never even had a boyfriend in school? - I never said that. - Yeah, but you never said you did. - What difference would it make if I said I had six boyfriends? - Six? You had six boyfriends at school? - No. No. No. Not six. Half a dozen. - Oh. Ah. Oh, this sucks. You know, here we are, the good guys, sitting in the freezing cold, eating shit takeaway. And there they are, living the high life of the corruption we're supposed to be preventing. If you ask me, one of the parties has got it wrong. - Come on, Dash. Don't lose the plot on me now. I mean, just think, there's only 15, 20 years of this and you can retire. - Yeah, so long as the baddies don't shoot me first. - Hey, this looks like my old girlfriend. (laughs) (man sings in foreign language) - Get a little wank. Hey! G'day (mumbles). You're entering my, you're piercing my (mumbles). Ah! Look, love, (mumbles) seagull! - [Woman] Oh, yeah, right. (group laughs) - Bloody wanker! You met me everywhere. Jesus freaking Christ. (mumbles) Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, look out! - It's time for you to leave, shrimpy. (man screams) (woman shrieks) Slay, not here. - [Taxi Driver] Taxi? - Yeah, that's right. Enjoy it, you little creep. Once you're on the inside, the only ass you'll be grabbing is your own, in pain. (Bobbi whistles) - Slay, man, I'm not gonna tell you one more time. Give me back my fuckin' cigarettes. - I never touched your bloody cigarettes. - Bullshit, you didn't! - Bobbi-- - It was sitting on the table. You know, you do this every fucking time, man. - Why would I wanna touch your cigarettes, man? = [Bobbi] Oh, well, where are they then, huh? - I don't know. I don't have them. - [Bobbi] Just give them back to me, come on, man, huh. - What did I just say? (Slay laughs) - Yeah, that's really good, Zed. - Okay, stay close, guys. - I expect an apology, man. - No, you don't get nothing from me. - I want an apology. - Just get in the car, all right? (rock music) - [Man] Hello. (man grunts) - No! No, stop! Don't kill me! No, stop, stop! No! What are you doing? (car alarm blares) No! - Hey. (horn blares) (passersby laugh) (phone rings) - Hello. - Dymo, Jack. You ready? Five a.m., my factory. - [Dymo] I'll be there. (Peter chuckles) - [Blondine] Dash? - Yeah. - What's with the little girl? - Oh, her parents were just killed in a drive-by shooting. - Bill, for god's sake, will you get someone up here to take care of this little girl? Hello. What's your name? - Lucille. - Who's this? - My friend. - You're gonna be okay. (phone rings) - Metropolitan Police. Detective Peter Dasha speaking. - Her name's Lucille. - Hello, Lucille. - Hi. - I'm Cathy. - What, five in the morning? It's still dark there. All right then, scumbag. This is your big chance. We'll have the cash, and trust me, we'll cover your ass every which way we can. But one smart move from you on this deal, boy, and you will go down on the spot. No ifs, no butts, dead meat. Just give me an excuse. We're on. (upbeat techno music) - [Slay] Duck! - Shit! (gunshot blares) (shooter grunts) (siren blares) - Yo, Dymo. (shooter groans) (shooter screams) - Dash, Dymo's arrived. - You brought the whole gang along, Dymo. - With 10 kilos, who would you trust? (Jack chuckles) - You know, one thing I've learned in this business is you can never have too much insurance. And that's one thing I noticed you guys don't have enough of, good insurance. I mean, you guys don't even carry guns. (chuckles) Insurance is like money. The more you have, the more protection you've got. But I didn't come down here to teach you any lessons, Dymo. You got the goods, I take it. - In there. I got the cash. - Oh, yeah. - Fuck, no. The case. - Now, now, go now! - [Officer] Freeze! - [Peter] Freeze, you bastards! - Freeze! - [Officer] Freeze! - Get your hands in the air. - [Officer] Get your hands in the air now! - [Officer] Get 'em up! - Well, Dymo, I told you I play for keeps. - Oh, yeah. She's been known to stack the deck in her favor, if you know what I mean. Isn't she, Jack? - Taxi! - Dymo! (device beeps) - Give it up, Jack. There's no way out. You're surrounded. - Well, it's your move, lady. But you see, there's still the contraption I've got in my hand. This is a remote control. And you see that contraption tied around those dainty legs? That is a large amount of extremely volatile explosive. - Ah, you're dog shit, Jack. - Woof, pig. It's your choice. But you shoot me, and I swear to you, with my last dying breath, I will bring this fucking place down our fucking ears! You see, Dymo, this is what I mean by insurance. Back off! I mean it! This one's Jack's hand. - Grenade! - [Officer] Grenade! - [Officer] Get down! (explosion blasts) (gunshots blare) (explosion blasts) (gunshots blare) - Are you okay? - [Carli] Dymo! - [Dymo] Come on! - [Peter] Jesus. - Dash, are you okay? - Yeah, that bastard. - You get Dymo. I'll grab a car and go after Jack Hand. - Right-o. - The breach! Come on! - Give it up, Dymo. You've got nowhere to go. You can't get out. You're surrounded. - Carli, what are you doing? Come on! - It's my favorite. - Stop! I'll shoot you! (gunshots blare) Stop! (Blondine screams) Oh, shit! Shit! Shit! - Block the gates. Block the gates. (upbeat techno music) - Dymo, what are you doing? - The breach. It's gonna be up every hour on the hour, and it's the only way back to the city from this part of town. So if we're quick enough, we'll catch him there. - This is an all points bulletin looking for a late model red Porsche 928, registration one hand, that's 1-H-A-N-D.

You don't cooperate, you're only gonna make it worse for yourself. - Detective Dasha, you've detained my client for 15 hours. Unless you intend to charge him with possession of a suitcase full of icing sugar, I suggest you let him go. - (scoffs) Let him go. Listen, you stuffed shirt. We have charges of trafficking drugs, carrying dangerous explosives, resisting arrest, dangerous driving just off the top of my head. If you want me to keep going, I can. - Yes, well, no one's perfect. Bearing in mind my client managed to locate a large sum of the city's money-- - [Dymo] $8 million I think it is. - Eight million? - It was eight million. - Which you lost. - Lost? For Christ's sake! All right then. What about the investigation into Jack Hand's murder, eh? - Murder? - Yeah! - Detective Dasha, my client is prepared to cooperate with you, which means that we won't be running to the press with stories of notorious criminals being handed large sums of public money. But he informs me that in his efforts to secure the safe return of the city's money, the late Mr. Hand's motor vehicle simply exploded. And unless you want to prove otherwise, with respect, I suggest that you proceed with the lesser charges. We can arrange bail, and we can all go home. - Thanks, Jonesy. Good work, man. Carli. Carli, I'm home. (Carli moans) (Carli and Blondine scream) (Dymo screams) (upbeat techno music)
