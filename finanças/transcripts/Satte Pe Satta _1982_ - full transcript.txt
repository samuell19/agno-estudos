Away from the city, from the flurry of everyday life... ...seven brothers live in this house with their animals. That is why, animal behaviour is noticeable in their life too. They gore with their heads when happy. And they punch when they want to show love. Get up! They sleep 48 hours of the 24 hours in a day. Get up! Look, I will count up to three. If you'll still don't get up... ...you will have to soak yourself in water... ...scrub yourself with soap and take a good bath. Alright, don't get up. One! Two! Open your eyes and look at me... ...open your ears and listen to me. - Som. - Yes. You will milk the cow today. What if I cannot get any milk? Then I will beat you to a pulp. Mangal, you will chop the wood and store it in the store house. The axe is not sharpened. Then, use a razor. - Budhu! - It's Budh. - Yes, Budh. - Yes. You will clean the stable and the cages of the poultry. Why make me clean those? We won't get the dung smell anymore. Smell your clothes. You'll get the same smell in them. - Guru. - Yes. Use the tractor to plough the field. Why plough the field? We can get food from the hotel... ...and fill our stomachs. One punch and your stomach will fill forever! Move! - Shukar. - Yes. You will cook food. But before that, you'll do the dishes. Who wants to soak hands in water early in the morning? If you don't put your hands in water, I'll put your head in it! Sunny. Cut the grass and store it in the back room. Why cut grass? The grass grows there. The animals can go there and graze on the grass. Even food is grown in the fields. So why cut and cook it? You can go there and eat it like a dog. - Now, move! - Ravi... ...this is not fair! You order us around every day. Milk the hens, cut the wood from the horse... ...clean the stable of the field. Whereas you sit and watch us work. Look, I'm your elder brother. And an elder brother is like a father. It is the duty of the sons to listen to their father. If a father, to give rest to his children, works for a day... ...does it affect his fatherliness? What is fatherliness? If there can be motherliness, can't there be fatherliness? Yes. Now tell us, will it make any difference to you? Yes, it will make a difference. And that's because I am your commander. A commander makes the plan, he himself doesn't fight the war. So we should all get a chance once a week to become the commander. - What do you say, brothers? - Yes! Just a minute. Just a minute! Who wants what chance? Each of us wants to be commander for a day. - Commander! - Commander. Yes. Whoever wants to be commander, come here. Come, brothers! So you want to become commander? Yes! What if you don't get this chance? Then we will pick a red flag and go on strike. We will raise our voice against atrocity! - Fulfill our demands! - Fulfill them! - Fulfill our demands! - Fulfill our demands! - Yes. - Yes. What is your reply to our demands? - You want a reply? - Yes. It is a simple reply. 'Zip zap zoom!' - Here he comes! - Watch out. - Very good! - Take that. Alright. The fools! Wanted to become commanders indeed! The food is on the table! The tall man will come now. You'll get beaten, and have us beaten too. I am hungry. Be quiet! Move! Ravi, are you alright? No! I mean, you will eat only this much today? This is all for you. What? I will have to go hungry. Fire! Fire! Fire! Help me! Fire! Sunny! Sunny. This darned Sunny should be taught a lesson! He is younger to us, so we always forgive him. - You are right. - And he makes a fool of us every day. He sometimes acts unconscious. And sometimes pretends he has stomach ache. He even presses an onion under his arm to catch a fever. But what will you do? What will we do! What are you going on about? We must at least have a small brain in our big heads. So think! That is not our cup of tea. - At least try. - We cannot. I've thought of an idea! Come here! That's a great idea! He's coming. With the burning embers, my heart beats faster. I don't know why Ravi has become so generous... - ...and is giving us this chance. - Why won't he? We are his younger brothers after all. Our faces may be different, but our hearts are one. - So true. - It's love. What is this about? - Listen! I'll tell you. - Yes. Ravi has laid a bet. The one who wins this bet... ...will be given a seven day holiday. He will be given milk and cream and fruits every hour. He can eat to his fill. - To his fill? - Yes! To your fill! What is the bet? A horse has to be tamed, that's all! - Just that much? - Milk and cream! - Yes. - Which horse? Is it that wild white mustang? Yes. But Ravi has warned us from going near him. He has said not to go near him until he's trained him completely. - That horse is dangerous. - No! If I get a week's holiday, I wouldn't get out of bed. I would neither wash my face, nor gargle... ...nor change my clothes. I would eat and drink in bed! And just relax! I would dream... ...get up, eat, and go back to sleep. Then dream again... ...get up, eat, and go back to sleep. But how can we unfortunate boys get a holiday for a week? How? Yes! Sunny. Sunny. - I made this mistake. - Sunny. I played this dirty trick. No, it is my fault. Sunny. Sunny. Go, get a wet cloth. Sunny. Sunny. Open your eyes, son. Sunny, my boy. Sunny. Who played this prank? Tell me. Who asked Sunny to saddle Raja? Tell me! You listen to me, all of you. If anything happens to Sunny... ...I will not spare any of you! If you hate your younger brother so much... ...I'll take him and go away from here. You can keep this house, this farm, this field, and everything! I don't want anything. I will take only Sunny and leave. Sunny. Sunny, open your eyes. Was this just a... I am absolutely fine. Nothing is wrong with me. This younger brother of yours will not die... ...even if he comes under an elephant's leg. This was only a horse. Why did you have us abused for no reason? I'm sorry, Som. Actually, I was testing Ravi. I wanted to see how much this... ...tough man's soft heart loves us. You do love us very much, Ravi. But Ravi does not love us. Of course I don't love you. You go under the feet of the horse... ...then you'll know how much I love you. - Come here. - No. My big grown up brother is crying like a woman. Ravi, don't ever say that you will leave us. You won't go, will go? Hey. How can I leave you all? Can the body ever leave the soul? You all are my soul. We will live together. We will sing out how we feel. We are the seven colours... ...and we will brighten up this world. We will live together. We will sing out how we feel. We are the seven colours... ...and we will brighten up this world. We are the seven notes of music. We make songs youthful. The sky is filled with joy. We are the seven wonders of the world. We are the world. We are the seven notes of music. We make songs youthful. The sky is filled with joy. We are the seven wonders of the world. We are the world. We will live together. We will sing out how we feel. We are the seven colours... ...and we will brighten up this world. We will share our joy. We will bear every sorrow together. Why should we shed tears? Let's support each other... ...and carry on. We distribute joys. We will bear every sorrow together. Why should we shed tears, then? Let's support each other... ...and carry on. We will live together. We will sing out how we feel. We are the seven colours... ...and we will brighten up this world. We will live together. We will sing out how we feel. We are the seven colours... ...and we will brighten up this world. - Hello Ramlala. - Welcome, Ravi. 10 canisters of kerosene, one sack of sugar... - ...5 kgs of tea, two tins... - Ravi, listen. Until you get the groceries packed... - ...shall we take a stroll and come? - Alright. - Hey, listen! - Yes. You'll are not going to drink, are you? No, we are only going to have milk. - Carry on. - Let's go. So where was I? Yes! 10 kgs salt, 2 kgs chillies... ...1 kg coriander powder, 1kg cumin, 1/2 kg pepperry... Pepperry? What is pepperry? Go, get two bottles of milk from the milk stall outside. Sorry? Milk? But sir... Look, when we visit that stall, we will order stuff from here. Take the money and get two bottles of milk. With nipples? Did you say something? I was saying that if kids ask for a bottle... ...they should be given one with a nipple. Because they don't have teeth... ...and if they do, they won't have any left. Don't bother them. They are not kids, they are sissies. Don't. Forget it... ...or we will get cremated here itself. They are six, and we are only two. No... ...not two, three! One, two, three. The seven footer has come. Now, become dare devils from sissies. The devils who cannot dare. No! The milk drinking kids! If a bull... If a bull stands in the middle of the road... ...people's blabber will not affect it. They will all have to run away. But you don't look like a bull, you look like a transvestite. Transvestite. How do I look? Like a transvestite. Who did I ask this? Him. I asked him. Yes sir, so how do I look? Trans... They were calling a bull a transvestite. As if there was no difference between the two. A bull is a bull, and a transvestite is a transvestite. That means, a bull is a bull, and a transvestite is a transvestite. Mr. Bull, will you have milk? Yes. Just a minute. Zip zap zoom! Open the bottle. Hurry! What are you doing? Leave my neck. Hey! Ravi, help! Ravi! Sunny, go get the milk. You scoundrel! Ravi! Milk! Yes. You'll have it. Who can fight and win over sorrow. What did you say? 'Who can fight us and win?' Not you, brother. Shekhar, you! What have you done to yourself? You look like a defeated lover. What is the matter? I wanted to be a true lover... ...but she did not agree. Who did not agree? The one who I made the mistake of falling in love with. But what happened? Where did she go? I don't know. Only two things mattered in my life. My beloved and my job. Both left me. You can get another job, but you want the same girl, don't you? Just give me her name and address and watch what I do. What is this? Who are you? I will tell you who I am later. First tell me who do you think you are? What? Who do you think you are? Are you a fairy from above? Are you a princess? Are you a heiress? What are you? Just because you are good looking, you have become so proud! What right do you have to play with someone's life? To first love him and then leave him? I am sure he is crazy. That guy is decent. But if it was me... ...I would wring your neck! I'll separate your head from your body, okay? Who are you talking about? He has drowned himself in liquor because of you... ...and you ask who I am talking about? I am talking about my childhood friend Shekhar, who else? - Shekhar? - Yes. Just go and look... ...what he has done to himself because of you. When he walks on the road, people give him charity... ...assuming he is a beggar. Whenever he would meet me... ...he would sing your praises. Sheela is my life! Since Sheela came into my life, it has changed. Sheela, Sheela, Sheela! He used to drive me insane. But look at you! You cheat, betrayer, selfish woman! You left him just because he lost his job? What are you staring at me for? Do you have any reply? - Do you want a reply? - Yes. Now listen to what I am saying! And if you say a single word in between, I will thrash you! First of all, I am not Sheela. And secondly, my name is lndu! Get that? I heard everything you said. I have realised my mistake. I want to meet Shekhar and apologise to him. Where is he? Sorry? He is sitting on a hill on liquor road and drinking bar. What? I mean, he is sitting in a bar on Hill road and drinking. Thank you. Excuse me! This lady who left... ...which is her room? I want to meet her. Even after being slapped so hard? Only after being slapped so hard do I want to meet her. The last room in the corridor, room number one, is hers. One. Thank you. Come in. - Nurse! - What is it? A watermelon? Who gave this? There is a tall man waiting down. He has given it for you. He has also given this letter. You may leave. This time I want to meet you not for Shekhar, but for myself. Please accept this small token of our friendship. I have come. You gave a gift to a woman for the first time. That too, a melon? What's bad about a melon? A melon is good for health. Where matters of the heart are concerned, you need to be romantic. Send her flowers. - What? - Flowers. Flowers! Hello. Guard! Hey, guard! Yes, ma'am? If I see this man here again... ...you will lose your job, is that clear? Yes, ma'am. Did you hear that? Get out! Can you see my baton? Be quiet! Say again what you said when your feet were on the ground. I was only joking. Put me down quickly. If anyone sees this, I'll lose my job. The flowers didn't work. I'll have to meet Sheela and think of another idea. So the patient is your brother? Yes, my elder brother. What is his problem? He has a serious problem. Earlier, only his heart was wounded. Now his entire body is wounded. - What does that mean? - I mean... ...he fell in love with a woman. He surrendered her heart to her, but that woman was not interested. The poor man was shattered. He tried to commit suicide. He jumped from a mountain. What? Then what happened? By God's grace, he survived. Did this incident have any effect on that woman? That is what we want to find out. If you were that woman, it would affect you, wouldn't it? It surely would. I am human after all. I'd admire that man. I would accept his love and apologise to him. Ravi's job is done! She's come! Go to your room! And don't come out until I tell you to! But if a woman is coming, why should we go to our rooms? - Yes. - Yes. It's only a woman, not the military. Who is this woman after all? - Who is she? - Be quiet! Will you'll leave or do I punch you all? Alright. Wait! Come closer. No one will step out of his room. - Alright. - No. No one! And no one will make any noise. No one will make any noise, is that clear? Yes. We will fit a silencer in our throat. Oh great! Your house is beautiful. You won't get to see the real beauty from here. Come and see on the other side. - There are such trees and flowers... - Really? ...that you will be surprised. - Come, I will show you the garden. - Let's go. The fool! Has he brought her here to see me or the garden? - The flowers are amazing... - Oh, I'm finished! - Where did this sound come from? - What was that? - I'm so doomed. - I think, your brother is in pain. - Let's go have a look at him first. - Yes. Let's go. - Save me! - Come. - Come along. - I am in terrible pain! Save me. - Hello. - Hello. Hello. - Does it hurt very much? - Yes. Don't worry, I will give you medication that will help you. You will recover soon. What happened to him? He is in terrible pain. So if anyone touches him... ...his whole body begins to shiver. Don't worry, you'll be relieved of pain very soon. What a shame! You have done this to yourself for a mere woman? What is he saying? He says that if he does not get her... ...he will chop himself into tiny pieces... ...pieces and offer them at her feet. But what purpose will it serve... ...if she realises that after you are dead? It is worthwhile only when you are alive, and she is with you. What is he saying? He is thanking you. And asking why you sympathise with him. Why not? Even I am human. Even I have a heart. I can understand how he feels. Do you understand how I feel? - You! - Yes, me. I have gone absolutely crazy. I don't know what is wrong with me. I stay awake all night, and sleep all day. I see your face everywhere. In walls, in windows, in pots and pans! I even see your face in food. That day, I had not brought a melon, but my heart to you. - Be quiet! - All I remember... You cheat, you fraud! You took the help of your cartoon brother... ...and brought me here on the pretext of suicide? - Do I look like a cartoon to you? - Be quiet! You assume I will sympathise with you... ...on hearing about your suicide attempt? That I will fall in love with you? Even if you fall from the sky and die... ...I will have no regrets. You are insulting me. You are fit for that! In fact, even filth is better than you. If you have a mirror in the house, look into it. If you don't, I'll give you money. Buy one and look at yourself. You will scare yourself. You stinking, filthy fellow! You haven't bathed in months. Coming close to you is frightening. It's like entering a stable. Do you think a woman will love you? You are something that one can use to scare people. Instead of poisoning someone... ...if your face is shown to him, he'll die. But... If you dare to bother me again... ...I will have you arrested and sent to jail. Get that? Move! So you want to bring a woman in the house? We will not allow that, Ravi! Correct! If a woman comes here, our life will be ruined. We will not allow any woman in this house. We don't want a sister-in-law. You fools! Don't you'll understand that I am doing this for your benefit? Our benefit? How is that? When a woman comes home, she will cook delicious food for you all. She will do the dishes, the house chores, everything! - She will cook delicious food? - Yes. - She will also do the dishes? - Yes. - And all the house chores? - Of course! That means she will be no trouble? No trouble at all. We didn't think about that. Do something, Ravi. She came like the soft breeze and left like a storm. Please. Don't worry, I will convince her and bring her back. Like the soft breeze! - Really? - Absolutely! Absolutely true! Now you all leave. Let me think of something to get her back. - Go. - Alright. You are not doing the right thing, Ravi. It is not right to cheat an innocent woman like that. Even you got fooled by my words? I said all this to prevent them from revolting. The truth is that I truly love her. Sheela. Indu. You look beautiful! You'll embarrass even the moon today. Your poor husband must be desperate. Shekhar, this is lndu, my best friend. - Hello. - Hello. Your best friend has come, but my best friend... How come flowers bloomed in a desert today? This suit, this perfume, clean shaven, combed hair. Wow! Based on someone's words, I deciphered... ...that whether your soul is clean or not, your body should be clean. Your thoughts may not be good, but your clothes have to be good. So I thought, let me try doing even that. I think you have given your heart to someone. I wanted to, but she doesn't want it. The way she dumped it, like as if it was a melon. My love, don't torment me. Your heart will give in to my love. My love, don't torment me. Your heart will give in to my love. Some day... ...you will fall in love. Your heart will give in to my love. When you think of me in solitude... ...you will be engulfed by thoughts of me. When you think of me in solitude... ...you will be engulfed by thoughts of me. Your heart will flutter. You will fall in love. My love, don't torment me. Your heart will give in to my love. When in love, you will come alive. You will lose yourself in my arms. When in love, you will come alive. You will lose yourself in my arms. You will lose control. You will fall in love. My love, don't torment me. Your heart will give in to my love. Some day... ...you will fall in love. Your heart will give in to my love. - Congratulations! - Congratulations! - Thank you. - Thank you. Congratulations! - Mr. Ravi. One moment. - Yes? Congratulations! Let's go. What was that? Nothing! I was looking for some leftover crackers. What for? Will you make fritters with them? You fool! Use your brains sometimes. Sister-in-law is coming home. Won't we give her a good welcome? Ravi, today I am very happy. I'd never imagined someone like you would come into my life. You will have a younger brother. Just the three of us, away from the city, peace surrounding us! You fools! Can't you see? - Be quiet, fatso! - Don't abuse me! Ravi! Ravi! I hate noise, shouting and screaming. - Good. - Yes. - You hate shouting and screaming? - Yes. Darn it! Take that, you! You beat your younger brother! Why are you quiet? Say something. What do I say? Actually, you see... ...after hearing you, I am feeling a little uneasy. - Uneasy? - Yes... ...uneasy with happiness. Like you have tears of happiness, I'm uneasy with happiness. You like a clean house, you like solitude. You avoid fights. And you are happiest about the fact that we are only three of us. Yes. I'll be darned! - What? - A band... ...will be played at home on our arrival. Sister-in-law, your cartoon brother-in-law welcomes you. - Hello. - Ravi. You know him. He is Sunny, my younger brother. And this is our house, our heaven... Sister-in-law! My brother. - He is my other brother, Shukar. - Hello. - And he is my third brother, Mangal. - Hello. Come, I will take you around my garden... No, how can we? - Your clothes have become... - Mine too. Shall we go in? Come. Sister-in-law. Come. Come. This is our hall. Every morning and night, we... Guru! This is my fourth brother Som... ...and the fifth, Guru. Hello, sister-in-law. - He is... - I know. Your sixth brother. Yes. He's Budhu. I mean, Budh. Are you just this many or 5-6 more? - No, we are just seven brothers. - Just seven? Yes. Father wanted a huge family... ...that could fill up a ground. But! He named us after the days of the week. Som, Mangal, Budh... ...Guru, Shukar, Sunny and me, Ravi. What would your names be if you'll were more than seven brothers? - The months of the year. - Wow! - What a calendar oriented family! - You bet. But there is something special about us seven brothers. Just don't ask how much we love one another! I am not asking! - We love each other dearly. - I can see that. Oh God. - Ravi! - What is it? What is this? It is the kitchen. A kitchen or a madhouse? Now whatever it is, it is this. Call it a madhouse, a guest house or whatever. You have to make it beautiful just like you. Don't get romantic. I'm feeling nauseous looking at this room. Let me clean up. You go out. Indu... ...cook such delicious food today that we even lick our plates. Since mother died, we have not eaten good food. We eat just anything. We add sugar instead of salt, kerosene instead of oil... Enough! Go and relax outside. I will call you as soon as the food is ready. Out! Out! I don't know where to begin! Yes. The food is ready! Come quickly! What are you waiting for? Start eating. Oh... ...so that's the reason. Thank God that you have at least that much manners. Hey, stop! I said, stop! Stop it! Please! Stop it! Animals! You are all animals! Is this the way to eat? I put in so much effort and cooked food for you all. And you pounced on it like animals! You are not fit for this! Animals! You are all animals! You will always be animals! Has she come here to cook food or dictate us? You had said that you are bringing home a maid. - Indu. - Don't touch me! Go away! You cheat! You lied to me. You told me you have only one brother. You tricked me into marrying you and brought me to this house. And you told you brothers you are bringing home a maid... ...who will do all the house chores. Have I come to this house as a maid? Is this your love for which I left the city, quit my job... ...and came here to this sick place with you? You have been very unfair. You cheated me. You have hurt me, you have ruined my life. You. You are right, lndu. I accept my mistake. I lied to you, I cheated you. I tried telling you the truth several times, but... ...couldn't gather the courage. If I'd told you about my brothers... ...you'd want to meet them. And once you'd met them, you would never come to this house. I would have lost you. I lied to you to get you. That is all I want to say. We truly are animals. There is no difference between animals and us. But... ...but what could we do? We were very young when we lost our parents. We were never scolded by a father... ...or hugged by a mother. We didn't have anyone who would teach us the ways of the world. We just supported each other... ...and have survived until now. Living in this farm with animals, we have ourselves become animals. I realise my mistake. So... ...I won't like to ruin your life with mine. I will take you back to the city tomorrow. You can go back to the world of honour and etiquette. You won't have to live with an uncouth family. OK? Stay here just for the night. I'll take you back tomorrow. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Won't you forgive your younger brothers? We've all come to beg for forgiveness. If our words have hurt you, you must thrash us! Beat us black and blue! But, don't leave us! Lf you leave, we'll be lonely. Very lonesome... Nobody ever came here to reform us. Honestly. And we look big. We're children at heart. Won't you forgive your children? If you leave, Ravi too will leave us. Without both of you, we'll be orphaned. Sister-in-law, please. Forgive us! My animals can shed tears too. Wipe the tears. Men don't cry. I forgive all of you. Now go and tell your 28 feet tall brother... ...if he has any sense, he must come up immediately. It's our first day of marriage. He must come with a smile. Go on. Yoohoo! Get up! You pig! - Wake up! - Good morning! Get up, you hippo! Why are you yelling early in the morning? I've been dreaming for 6 days. Each time I go near the girl, somebody wakes me up! Look here and there and you'll all scream! - Look! Look! - Our clothes! - Where are they? - Now strut around in underwear! - Hold on. Where's Sunny? - Not here. - No? - He's behind this! - Are you awake? - Sister-in-law! We are awake. Quickly get up. Your brother is taking us on a picnic. - What? - Yes We'd get ready but that rascal Sunny took our clothes. I took the clothes, not Sunny. - You did? - It was you? What will you do with our clothes? To wash them, what else? Why are you ruining them? Does anyone wash clothes? Be quiet! Your clothes were so filthy and stinking... ...a rat would sniff at them and roll over and die! I washed them in boiling water yet they're dirty. You destroyed the beauty of the clothes! Come out, shower and get ready. - What? Shower? - Shower and shave... ...wear clean clothes and come for the picnic like humans. The mention of water makes me sick. I feel faint if I see anyone bathing. God gave such lovely hair, why do people shave it off? Sister-in-law! Will you come out or should I come in? She's bluffing. We're in such a shabby state. She won't come in. She won't come in. I'm asking for the last time. Are you coming out or not? - No! We won't come! - Really? Then, I'll come in. No! Close the door. - Come out fast. - Oh, my God! Boogie boogie! Sister-in-law! You are great. Only you can change these beasts. In 2 days you did what I couldn't in years. I'm here to reform all 7 not 5. What are you waiting for? Out. - Where to? - For a bath. I got dry cleaned the day we got married. You'll have to plunge into the water and bathe. Quiet. - Get going! - Come on! Come on! - Come on! - What are you looking at? Nose. - All ready? Get started. - Yes! Ravi, what happened? My stomach is aching! Press his stomach! - What are you doing? - Your leg ached the other day... ...we pressed it and it was better so, we're pressing your stomach! Stop! Will you press my throat if it hurts? Yes! Move aside. - What's going on? - His stomach aches. Really? No, there doesn't seem to be anything. It's not superficial. It goes deep inside. Take out the bags. The picnic stands cancelled. Don't cancel the picnic. I'm feeling better. We can't leave you and go. My sweets, my baby. You go on. Yes. Indu will take care of me. We don't like to leave you in this state. - They are right. - You're funny. They arranged the picnic with such love and effort. Let them go. How can I stop them? - Go or my pain will increase! - OK. - Go on. - Let's go. - Good boys! - Alright. Are you well? - Yes. - Let's go. - Let's go. - You can go. Oh, dear! Bye! Your stomach. It's an excuse to get rid of them. If the battalion stayed here... ...could I have talked to you of love? Come into my arms. What a relief! Come here! Girls! The mood is romantic, it's an unknown road. The mood is romantic, it's an unknown road. A new story can come up at any time. The mood is romantic... ...it's an unknown road. A new story can come up at any time. My heart is aflutter, now. Youth always brings torment. My heart is aflutter, now. Youth always brings torment. It can never be trusted. Who know when it will be gone? It can never be trusted. Who know when it will be gone? It's yours for now and can belong to someone else. The mood is romantic... ...it's an unknown road. A new story can come up at any time. The thought of new things makes me nervous. Nights of love are in the offing. The thought of new things makes me nervous. Nights of love are in the offing. Everyone knows that lovers are crazy. Everyone knows that lovers are crazy. It will happen soon, why fear it? The mood is romantic... ...it's an unknown road. A new story can come up at any time. Asha! You're really foolish! That rock was rolling towards you. Why didn't you get up and run? These rich folks need to be... - ...saved by servants, even while dying. - Right. Excuse me, she's not one of those rich girls... ...who can't function without her help. In fact, she's a rich girl... ...who can't move with any servants to help her. Can't move? She has no legs! She's a cripple. Handicapped. You are right. She can't walk. Pardon us. We spoke without thinking. We didn't' know. We simply rambled on. It doesn't matter. When a person is crippled... ...he has to swallow bitter pills and words. But I'm used to it. Actually our floor up here is vacant. No connection between the tongue and mind. Lines cut. Please smile. What are your names? - I am Seema. This is Madhu. - Hello. - She's Aradhana. - Hello. - This is Prema. - Hi. - Asha. - Hello. - Rajni. - Hi. Shobhni. - Som. - Mangal. - Budh. - I'm Guru. - Shukra. - Shani. We're so glad to meet you. The Red Cross Society is having a program on Sunday. You must come. Oh yes! - Bye! - Bye. Bye! - Bye! - Bye. - Bye! - My Lily. Bye! We got them! Quiet! I don't want to hear any explanations! All of you are useless! Good for nothing! I do everything for you! I provide for your food, clothes! But the 6 of you can't look after my poor niece! - Shame on you! - It's not their fault. - I asked them to go. - But why did they leave you? They should always be with you. That's their duty! God forbid, if that stone had touched you... ...how would I face the world? Everyone would say an uncle got his rich niece killed. Because she's going to be 21. And she's going to inherit millions. None of you know... ...how difficult it is to be trustee to a wealthy heiress. People suspect you all the time. I pray to God that you complete your 21 st birthday... ...and I'll hand over every penny of your inheritance. And I... ...I'll go far away. If I have hurt you... ...then, I am very sorry. We are very sorry, uncle. It's alright. It's alright. It's not my fault. I swear, I did my best! But... I hate men who don't do their work well. - Had it not been for the boys... - Whatever, the girl is alive! Get out. Get out, you scoundrel! Get out. Thanks. But darling, there's a lot of time before Seema turns 21. And she lives with you. She can be crushed at any time. - Isn't it? - No. You are wrong. - I can't do this at home. - Why? If she is killed outside, they cannot blame me. Only Babu can do this. Who is Babu? The devil in human form. Where is he? Serving his sentence in prison. Babu will be released from jail and Seema from life. No. No way! None of you will go to the Red Cross party! Why not? The poor girls invited us with such love. - With love? - Yes. - With decency? - Yes. Do you know what love is? - You know, it's... - Yes! - Of course we do. - OK! What is decency? Decency is that... What is it? It's... It's very nice. Why are you looking at me? Look that way and speak. This is your situation! Sit tight. Have you seen how you walk? You look like 7 prisoners released after life imprisonment! When you speak, it sounds as if somebody is throwing vessels! If you open your mouth in the city, all the girls will flee! So the best thing is to stay home quietly. Sister-in-law! Nobody learns everything in the womb. You learn it after birth. From your own people and we have only one... ...and that is you. Won't you teach us? - Yes, you must teach us. - Yes, teach us. - Please. - Very well. I'll try. - Yeah, sister-in-law! - She is going to teach us. Play a tune. Bow your head and ask, madam, how do you do? No, no, no. Not like that. Act it out. Bow your head and ask, madam, how do you do? How do you do? Bow your head and ask, madam, how do you do? How do you do? When she says, how do you do? Say, I like you. I like you. Get it? Bow your head and ask, madam, how do you do? How do you do? When she says, how do you do? Say, I like you. I like you. Really? Now, let's see you do it. How will you say it? - How do you do? - Yes! - How do you do? - I love you! Oh, no! Not so soon! If she likes you... ...she will blush. You can be sure, the fish will bite your bait. If she likes you, she will blush. You can be sure, the fish will bite your bait. Look into her eyes... ...and say, what kind of magic did you do? When she asks, what kind of magic? Say it! Don't be shy! - I like you! - Now, you get it. Let's move on. Wait up! You stop it, too. You keep playing for no reason. So, tell me what if she doesn't blush? Silly boy! If she doesn't blush... ...someone else will blush. - Really? - Yes. Hold her lovingly and take her into a corner. She will be nervous and... ...and you be a bit nervous, too. Hold her lovingly and take her into a corner. She will be nervous and... ...and you be a bit nervous, too. Put your arms around her. Say it! Speak up! I like you! What now? Oh, no! Here, say I love you! - I love you. - I love you. - I love you. - I love you. I love you. Let's hustle. It's a party of angels, everyone is single. It's a party of angels, everyone is single. Catch up, as it's time. Blossom, as it's time. Catch up, as it's time. Blossom, as it's time. Catch up, as it's time. Blossom, as it's time. Catch up, as it's time. Blossom, as it's time. The mood is romantic. The road is unknown. A new story can come up at any time. It's a party of angels, everyone is single. It's a party of angels, everyone is single. Catch up, as it's time. Blossom, as it's time. Catch up, as it's time. Blossom, as it's time. Catch up, as it's time. Blossom, as it's time. Catch up, as it's time. Blossom, as it's time. Zip zap zoom! This isn't a wound! I've been wounded like this many times. Be quiet and sit still! Not another word or I'll brand you with burning wood! I know you have a strong body! I'd taught these fools! And you ruined everything! Don't talk nonsense! Those city boys, bred in the gutter. I should have watched them beating up my brothers! What honour would we have? Great. The scene you created... ...the entire city must be gossiping about you! If the cops had come, all of us would have been locked up! What do you mean? We should have stood there with arms folded... ...brothers, beat us up. You own us. Tell us when you tire so we can drop you off home. She talks nonsense! Fine. Do as you please! And I'll do as I please! Hey, sister-in-law! - Don't say that. - Let go. I'm furious! If you get furious, what will we eat? Stop kidding. - You were there. - Yes. Tell us did we pick a fight or did they force us? - Yes! - Yes. But, I want to know why did you fight? They were there. How could we get thrashed in front of them? - Who? - They... The girls we met, since then something is wrong. That's done it! You were good for nothing, now you're doomed! One should hold the book straight even if the head isn't. - I... - No need to explain. Everyone is lost. One meeting with the boys changed everything! Where's Shobhni? Add salt to the lentils. Why are we suddenly leaving for Pune? Tomorrow is the 3rd. Babu will be released. He'll do our job on the 4th. And I'll be talking to the lawyer regarding Seema's property. If anyone suspects me of killing Seema... ...the lawyer will testify that I was with him. Oh. Seema's inheritance will be mine on the 5th. Hey, you! Are you on strike? Why are you looking at me like dumb fools? Get on with the job! Or you won't get food! They're not moving even when I mentioned food! - Indu! - What? Indu. Indu. - What is it? - Something has happened. Something has happened to the boys. Have they had booze? Have you seen them? They look sick! As if they have no life! What a brother you are! Don't you know anything? - What is it? - They are in love. What does that mean? Oh, come on! What a nuisance! You're equally dumb! They are in love. What? In love? What did you see? Why did you call me crazy? I don't get it... ...explain it to me. When you fall for someone... ...your heart beats faster and you are more restless. When someone counts the stars at night... ...you should know he is in love. Love has brought you to a strange point. - Your heart is in agony... - Agony! Tell me, what will happen? Love has brought you to a strange point. - Your heart is in agony... - Agony! Tell me, what will happen? Turn off the lights. Turn off the lights. Turn off the lights, I can't sleep. I won't sleep if they are turned off. When will the one who turns the lights off come? Don't make noise or... ...sister-in-law will wake up. Love has brought you to a strange point. - Your heart is in agony... - Agony! Tell me, what will happen? Love has brought you to a strange point. - Your heart is in agony... - Agony! Love has brought you to a strange point. What will happen? - Let's get the girls! - Yeah! Love has brought you to a strange point. - Your heart is in agony... - Agony! Tell me, what will happen? Love has brought you to a strange point. - Your heart is in agony... - -Agony! Tell me, what will happen? What is this helplessness? Hearts are one, yet why are you apart? We will go and bring them. If the family doesn't allow it. We will go and bring them. If the family doesn't allow it. Love has brought you to a strange point. - Your heart is in agony... - Agony! Tell me, what will happen? Love has brought you to a strange point. - Your heart is in agony... - Agony! Tell me, what will happen? Hey. You! You haven't slept. It's pretty late. No. I stayed up to witness your deeds. Free the girls! Undo the bonds. Okay. Save us! Sister! These boys kidnapped us from home! Really, sister. Don't worry. I'll handle them. So you are behind this. What did you think when kidnapping the girls? I thought they were girls. Do you know what a grave crime you've committed? Why are you standing with heads lowered? - Answer me! - Answer what? None of this would have happened if not for you! What did I tell you? I asked you why the boys looked lost... ...you said they were in love with the girls. - Yes. - Quiet! But is it right to forcibly kidnap somebody from their homes? We didn't force them. We brought them with care. What else could I do? Look at my brothers. Faces hanging down to their knees... ...they neither eat nor drink nor sleep or work. I too have a duty towards my brothers. Bravo. What a duty you've performed. You should get a reward from the government. Quiet. Now hear me carefully. It's late so the girls will stay here tonight. Inside. With me. I'll take them to town tomorrow morning. And you'll sleep out in the stable. Get that? Come on in. Zip zap zoom! I think the night's episode scared her. I can't let her go in this state. - Let's inform her family. - Whom can we inform? She has an uncle who left for Pune for a week. - Call the servant. - OK, but with the boys... ...how can we stay here? With me around, you need not have any fears. As long as you're here, none of the brothers will step in. Not even my husband. OK? We'll cable Seema's uncle. What is the Pune address? Now, I know why Babu couldn't do the job. Meaning? Whom would he kill when Seema isn't home? She's gone to the farmhouse with her friends. - They sent the telegram. - Now, what? Meet Babu to set up another plan. But, first I must go and meet my darling niece. Normal. - No fever. - But I feel weak. Stay here for a few days in this fresh air... ...eat the fresh produce of this farm that I cook. Every ailment will flee. Don't tell your uncle my husband... ...and his foolish clan kidnapped you. No, who will say that? Actually they're silly, not dangerous. Tell him, he's not allowed inside. He must leave or it will be bad for him. Did you hear? Tell this guard I don't harbour any desire to come in. I'm going to the city for a few days so I want to speak to you. All that happened yesterday was my mistake. I saw my brothers sad... ...and made this silly mistake. So please forgive me. The children aren't at fault. It was my mistake. You may not be there when I return. You would have gone home. So I came to apologise. If possible forgive this elder brother of yours. Listen... ...I'll be waiting. Be sure to return by Friday. If I inadvertently hurt you or your feelings... ...forgive me. The devil is here. Oh, no. Thank God, she's fine. It disturbs me each time she is slightly unwell. She's my elder brother's child, but I love her a lot. - Thank you so much. - What for? She's like my younger sister. Seema is still not very well. I'd like her to rest here. But I can't stop you from taking her home. If she's not well, let her be here. I won't let her move. I can bear to be away from her. But I can't bear her being unwell. You may keep her for a few days. If you need anything, I'll send it from town. By the grace of God, we don't lack a thing. Just send them some clothes and medicines. - I'll get them tomorrow. - Don't bother. My husband is in town. He will return in 2 days. - Give them to him. - Where in town? He's with his friend, Shekhar. The telephone number is 566189. - Yes, hello? - Mr. Ravi Anand? Speaking. - Ranjit Singh here. - Who? I can't place you. Seema is staying at your farm with her nurses. - Right. - I'm her uncle. I get it. What can I do for you? I'd gone to the farm. Your wife asked me to send some items. I'll come home tomorrow. I'll pick them up then. Welcome, Mr. Ravi Anand. Anything wrong? Nothing. Did you have a problem finding the house? No. - How do you do? - Sit down. - Drink? - Yes. Why were you staring at me? You reminded me of a very dear friend. He's very much like you. Tall and broad shouldered. Young, handsome. Are you a leftie? Do you use your left hand? Yes. My dad would say... ...use your left hand if you want to keep the world in hand. No, this is too much. I'm not used to drinking. I don't drink. Know why? It ruins the liver. - Here... - I see. So I don't drink but that day at a friend's marriage... ...they forced 4 bottles down my throat. - Here. - OK. You told me about the farm house, but not your brothers. My brothers! Each one is a gem! I love them a lot. The youngest is... ...Sunny. My youngest brother is so cute. I love him a lot. He's very hard working. He works the hardest in the farm. - Do you know why? - Why? He doesn't drink liquor. Liquor ruins the liver. I'm not in the habit, I went to this friend's wedding... They forced me to drink only 4 bottles. The one elder to him? - What? - Older than Sunny? Shukra is elder to Sunny. A fragment of rock. He's very strong. If he hits the wall, he'll make a hole. Very strong. His body is like steel. Know why? - Why? - Doesn't drink liquor. - Liquor... - Ruins the liver. You're not in the habit, but at this friend's wedding... ...you were forced into drinking 4 bottles. Right. You're too much. I must kiss you. Very good. - And the one elder to him? - To whom? - To Shukra. - Right. Guru is elder to Shukra. And Budhu. This brother of mine is a fool. God's cow. He's so docile. Not a cow! A buffalo. Not a buffalo, sorry. No, buffaloes are black. Cow... ...he knows nothing about any vice. Know why? Doesn't drink. Liquor ruins the liver. - I'm not in the habit... - Went to a friend's wedding... ...and he forced you to drink 4 bottles. How do you know? You're great! I must kiss you! Wonderful. - Who is elder to him? - What? Elder to Budhu is... - ...Mangal. - Hangal? Not Hangal... - What? - ...but Mangal. I see. He stammers a little. He stammers. Handsome boy. He's very strong. He can slap a coconut into 5 pieces! - Do you know why? - He doesn't drink liquor! - Liquor ruins the liver... - It ruins the liver. ...you're not in the habit but, you went to a friend's wedding. And he forced you to drink 4 bottles. And you know that, too! Another kiss coming up! That is so great! - Good? - Yes. Who is elder to him? Som is elder. He talks a little loudly. But he's soft... ...so soft! Soft nose, soft heart... ...soft, no. He too is very strong. You know? You know, an elephant... ...alright. I'll sit. He flies up and kicks elephants. The elephant's skull cracks and the brain spills out. Why? He doesn't drink liquor. Drinking liquor... Watch it! Hey, wait! Good luck, Babu. This is Ravi's chain. You are here? Take him away and tie him up. You thought it a cake walk to stealthily get in the house. And we'd get no inkling. What-what won't you know? We know everything about you. What do you know? Don't act smart. You know what we're saying. No, I don't know. Today is your birthday. Birthday? Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. - Happy birthday to you. - You scared me. - Happy birthday to you. - Listen. Listen. Ravi got a chance to go in because it's his birthday! - Go in. - What is inside? - Your birthday present. - Present? You fought with your wife because of us. Today, for your birthday... ...we will end that story and forgive you. - But, I, listen to me. - Go in. Open the door! On your birthday I'm giving you... ...the best gift a wife could. I'm feeling shy to look into your eyes and say this. Hence I'm writing it. I am expecting... ...I'm carrying your child. - A child? - Yes. Why are you running from me? No, people say when the hearts are one... ...the distance won't matter and... - ...we are one at heart. - Should I turn the lights off? - The lights? - Yes. They can see our shadows downstairs. No. I haven't come here for that. - What do you mean? - I mean... - ...l have to write accounts. - Accounts? Every moment is difficult when you go out on work. And you'll write accounts the moment you get back. Don't you care about my heart, my feelings? I do, but... Down with Ravi and Indu! Down with Ravi and Indu! Down with Ravi and Indu! Down with Ravi and Indu! - You're inside. - But, we are outside! - Down with Ravi and Indu! - A strike! And, it's right. I am going to sleep here while they sleep out there. They will keep battling the mosquitoes. It's not fair, injustice... ...l think, I too should go down. Your wish. This just won't do! Quiet! I'm coming. I'm coming. And I have some good news. Yeah! It's sad that... ...I sleep inside and you sleep outside. Go to sleep. So, I've decided, while the girls are here... ...I won't go in and neither will you. What? Come on. - Ravi! - What? You had some good news. What is that? Yes. I almost forgot. All of you are going to be uncles. When I first came here, this wasn't a home. It was an asylum. I went berserk trying to clean it up. The eating habits of... Who is it? It's me. What is it? Why have you come in? It's very cold. - Cold, is it? - Can I have a blanket? Stand there, I'll get it. Don't bother, I'll give it. So what was I saying? Feeling very cold? Now that I've seen you it's not cold. Aradhana. Coming. Som. Out. So I was telling you about the way the brothers ate... - Now, who is it? - It's me. What do you want? - Girl... - Girl? I mean a splinter hurt me while chopping wood. So you want the first aid box? Yes. May I come in to take it? No. Stand there, I'll get it. It's not right for you to give the box when I'm here. - You remain seated. - No, I'll give it. - The first aid... - Yes, come out. I see. So this is the matter. What are you doing here? You'll never learn! We're thirsty. Can we get some water? - Water? Inside? - Yes, yes! If anyone of you knock on the door... ...I will push you down the well. You will be swallowing water all your lives! Understand? Get lost! lf anyone turns around I'll break your legs! - Let's go. - Come on. What have you got today? Lollipop. What a state! Everyone is spoilt! How many can I reform? You're making a mistake. Indu is upstairs. Yes. I thought she's probably here. Forgive me. What's the matter? What is he doing here at midnight? He's feeling cold. He wanted to borrow a blanket. But he's in the wrong room, asking the wrong girl. Water... ...water! Looks like the fizz has gone out. Why don't you kill Ravi? - His life could put us at risk. - No. Ravi is useful to us when alive. The moment Babu returns after killing Seema... ...I'll send Ravi back... ...and he'll be charged with killing Seema. You? Indu isn't here. She must be outside. What is wrong? Why are you looking at me so strangely? Why don't you say something? You seem to be up to no good. Stop right there, please. Stop right there! Why don't you speak? Answer me! What do you want? What do you want? Tell me! No. Ravi! No, Seema. What is going on? What is it? Seema! You... You got off the chair! How? How did you move? That's Ravi's miracle. He scared her with that knife. She ran out of her chair. Great job. - You're fantastic! - Amazing. He's performed a miracle! We'd thought Seema would never walk in her life. Brother, you're wonderful. We only loved you... ...but now we respect you. Why are you crying? You should be happy. You can go anywhere on your own. You're not dependent on the chair. Pray to God to give you a husband like him... ...who sympathises with others' pain and fills their life with joy. Forgive me. You came to give me life. And I thought you wanted to kill me. I'll never be able to repay this debt! You're an angel! May God fill your life with joys. I pray that all your troubles come to me. This family should always be happy! Be happy, always. Be happy, always. Enough, don't cry now. Don't cry. There will be no more sorrows and difficulties in your life. Any obstacle in your path will have to face me first. I'll give my life but keep you safe. No sorrow will torment you. A two for two, or a seven on seven. A two for two, or a seven on seven. If you check it out carefully, it's a card on another.

Wives pray for their husbands. May God keep her husband well. No, I don't deserve it. What are you saying? I am right. I'm not who you think I am. I am a criminal. I'm a criminal who spent most of his life in jail. I'm neither anyone brother nor anyone's husband. This isn't true. I am Babu, not Ravi. Babu. If you don't believe me... My name is Babu. I resemble Ravi so, I was sent here. I must kill Seema, the moment I find an opportunity. - Kill me? - Yes. Your uncle Ranjit Singh sent me... ...here to kill you and paid me Rs. 100,000 for it. When you die, he will have control over... ...all your property, solo. No! Cheat! Scoundrel! You pretended to be our brother and made fun of our love! - Don't delay. Beat him up! - Thrash him! Hit him! - Hit him! - Go on! - Hit him! - Beat him up! Hit him! Get up, you cheat! Come on! Hit him. Don't let him go. Hit the rascal! Hit him. Hit him. - Wait. - Sister-in-law, get away. I said, wait up! I know, he is our enemy. He lived in our home and deceived us. But he didn't cheat me. He didn't deceive my duty, my honour. He didn't touch a chaste wife. Don't think of what he's done. Imagine what he could've done. He lived with us but never came close to me. Or your sister-in-law wouldn't be able to face your brother. A sister-in-law is like a mother and you honoured our mother. So we forgive you... ...but tell us where our brother is. I will tell you but I have a request. This story began with me and I will bring it to an end. Babu is your brother till Ravi returns. He is with you. Ms. Indu. I beg forgiveness for my deeds. The truth is that my origins are disgraceful. I grew up in an environment of deception and perfidy. I stole to fill my stomach, cheated to survive... ...because that's what my world taught me. What is a family, a sister? I never knew what a brother or sister-in-law means. After living with you for a few days, for the first time... ...l felt I was human. Apart from strength, there's a heart in the body... ...and the heart told me, Babu... ...these people are like you. Don't deceive them. You have given me a new form, a new life. I can never forget that. I must say this... ...whether Babu survives or not... ...your husband will live. I promise your love will live. There's only one way to get in. You wait here. I'll get back. Ranjit. I have removed Seema from your path. Now you may send Ravi back to his right place. Babu. Ravi is in his right place now. Not only Ravi, your right place too is here. What do you mean? Do you think I'm a fool? If I can send you in Ravi's place... ...can't I send somebody to keep an eye on you? Now your life and Ravi's will end right here. Turn around. Bring Ravi and him up. Shoot them. - Kill them. - Wait! One moment, sir. Sir, don't kill me. It's not my fault. I don't even know these people. He brought me. Don't hit me. I don't even know him. I don't know, sir. I don't want to die. Don't kill me. I haven't done anything. It's not my fault. Yes, sir. He brought us! We don't know anything. He brought us! Hey! Stop! Nobody will touch him! He's my prey. Promise me, nobody will get in the way. Come what may. Come on. Come on. Come on. Zip zap zoom! Zip zap zoom! Zip zap zoom! Zip zap zoom! Zip zap zoom! Zip zap zoom! Zip zap zoom! Zip zap zoom! Zip zap zoom! Zip zap zoom! Zip zap zoom! Zip zap zoom! Zip zap zoom! Zip zap zoom! Zip zap zoom! Zip zap zoom! Zip zap zoom! Are you leaving? - Why? - I've fulfilled my duty. Take care of yourself. If there's any feeling in your heart for me... ...don't ever sit in this chair. Get up. I say, get up. No. I thought somebody had turned my life around. I felt a new joy. But now, I feel that was a lie. I think, I am destined to remain in this chair forever! Get up. Whoo! Come into my arms! The End
