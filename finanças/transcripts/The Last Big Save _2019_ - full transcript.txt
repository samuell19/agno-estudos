My name is Joey Bird. I was born and raised in Brighton, Ontario, Canada. I had a great childhood. The beach is beautiful there. Its people are all friendly and all we did from the moment I could walk is play hockey. On the streets, on the pond, in the back yard.. I loved it. Then everything came to a halt when my mom died. It seemed like my dad kind of blamed me. So all we had between the two of us was hockey. Didn't talk much. He started drowning himself in self-pity by drinking and just being a nasty, sarcastic individual. But all we had was ourselves. I kept playing hockey and I got drafted at 18 by the Cincinnati Cheetahs in the States. Sometimes you get lucky and people embrace it. And sometimes you get lucky and people disgrace it. I disgraced it. I started drinking and doing drugs and basically fucked my career up. But Mr. Brown, the owner of the team, for whatever reason just tried to help me. But my dad washed his hands and basically turned his back. This is my story about the game that I love.. Hockey. ¶ I wonder why sometimes I cry ¶ ¶ I wonder why some day I'll die ¶ ¶ I wonder why I just can't fly ¶ ¶ I wonder all the time ¶ ¶ I wonder why I just can't see ¶ ¶ I wonder why you just left me ¶ ¶ Am I the one that only sees ¶ ¶ I wonder ¶ ¶ Some day I'll be a better person ¶ ¶ I know that I can be ¶ ¶ Just give me a chance to find me ¶ ¶ I wonder ¶ ¶ Sometimes I wonder what it could be ¶ ¶ Sometimes I wonder if I was better than me ¶ ¶ Sometimes I wonder if I was someone else ¶ Lou, I understand you believe in this kid. But you gotta trust me... a snake may shed its skin but not its habits. - Jesus Christ. Come on, Derek. I had to do something and this is what I did. It was my choice to do it, I did it. And it's your choice to make, I understand, Lou. But you brought me on this team to make a winning team out of it. For 38 years we've had a dry run. Look, I brought you on this team because I knew you could do the job and you've done it. You've brought me to the point where I want to be with it. But I own this fucking team! And I want to get him here! How I get him, I don't know. I've been looking all over for the fucking guy. But I do believe in him, alright, Derek? I do believe- It's the seventh game! We could take the championship and you're gambling everybody's hopes and dreams on this wild kid! Derek, I signed this guy to 20 years of his contract, alright? He worked for me for ten years. I continued to pay his salary because I believed in this kid. This kid earned a second chance with me because we might not have won a championship but he brought us to the fucking playoffs ten fucking years in a row! It's my fucking fault we didn't win, okay? Maybe I did something wrong, but not him. I fucking believe in him. I believe in him! I believe he's gonna do it and I'll die thinking that. Lou, it's your team. It's your money, you own it. But every player on this team.. Their hearts, their dreams are gambling on your choice- I believe that Joey Bird will fly high again! Period! End of story, I'm outta here. ¶ ¶ Kid? Kid! ¶ ¶ ¶ Big sports news out of Cincinnati. Cheetahs owner Louis Brown has lost his mind over Joey Bird. Bird, you may recall, the disgraced goalie from nearly two decades ago is now in for game seven. Brown should have never signed this guy to a contract for 20 years in the first place. It's a disgrace. When you run a sports franchise, you can't think with your heart. You have to think with your brain and your pocketbook. I think this goes back to his personal life. Brown lost his son to heroin and suicide years ago, and I think he was trying to mentor the kid because of that sad and dark experience with his son. And what does he get for it? This sad and dark experience. Joe, I'm sorry. I'm disappointed in you. Are you running for mayor? Mr. Brown has done his best to bring a championship team and for you to refer to his son.. That's grossly unfair. Joey! There's someone at the door! Joey! Lou! Hi! Come on in. Joanne.. You're the last person I expected to be here. - Yeah, me too. Is Joey here? - Yeah. Joey! Joey! - Didn't I tell you not to open that fucking door? But it's Lou Brown! He's the same guy, eh? Never changes. - No, consistent. How are you feeling? Good? I am, yeah. I'm good. - You look great. Mr. Brown... You didn't forget me then, huh? Good seeing you, kid. Look, uh.. Excuse me, Joanne, but could you see me over at the restaurant in 30 minutes? I'd like to talk to you. - Across the street? Yeah, across the street. Okay? - Absolutely. ¶ Hi Joey, you want anything? - I'm good. Uh, look. I do lots of favors for people and I'm not accustomed to asking favors, but I'm gonna ask you for a favor. - Anything. I want you to play. - Play what? Uh.. "Play what?" We're in the seventh game of the championships, you know that. - Yes. I want you to play in that game. - Ask me anything but that. Mr. Brown, I haven't played pro hockey in about 15 years. I'm gonna embarrass you and I'm gonna embarrass myself. Everybody's gonna hate my guts. Joey, you're on my payroll. - Yes, and I appreciate it. And I'm asking you as a favor to play in that game. I need it. Can you give me a chance to think about it today, please? We signed a 20-year contract, you and I. And I kept paying. I kept paying because nobody else would hire you. But I did. I'm asking you for a favor. You've got to commit to me right now that you will do the game. I need you. - I'll do the game. You're gonna do it? - Yes. I have your word? - You have my word. That's why I love you, kid. I'd like you to go over to the rink 8:00 a.m. tomorrow. I want him to look you over and then let me know what it's gonna cost me for the additional insurance to put you back on the ice. I have to do that, you know that. I'm a businessman. Get some rest. You're sure you don't want something? - Thanks, Mr. Brown. Okay. Joey? Get some rest, you look tired. See you later. - Okay. Listen, he's hated. Fans hate this guy. He hates his own guts. He's the poster boy for a loser. I'll tell you what. If this guy can do anything right, it's beyond me. How is this guy gonna get in that net - against the New York 21s, one of the best teams ever put on the ice - in the championship game and stop the puck? I say no. I have a feeling, Joe, that they won't hate him after the game. This guy has put his reputation on the line and he's got a young guy that can play goal. We'll see what happens come game time. ¶ ¶ I just gotta wonder why you put me under ¶ Hey, Joe. - What? You see it? Wow! - Alright! Ho ho ho! Tough. Whoa! Dammit. - A fucking gutter ball. - Whoa, I can't stay up. ¶ Hi! So what did he say? I think he's crazy. He, uh.. Wants me to play.. - Play what? ..Wants me to play in game seven of the championship. - Well, what are you gonna do? I don't know. And I don't know how to say no. He's been really good to me. - Where are you going? Um.. I'm gonna go see my dad. Why? Your dad is the Dr. Kevorkian of motivational speakers. Why do you still smoke? Really? Thank you for noticing. Well, I covered both sides. - Got left and right. Let's see a double. Let's see you double up. - I can't do any worse than that. Come on. Ho ho ho! - You've got it going! You've got a perfect game going, man. ¶ ¶ Come on, Joey. Hey, it's Joey Bird. I'm not here, leave a message. ¶ One pin! One dime! You got one. That's better. - Hook! That's better. Better. - Pretty shitty. Alright, you're going for a turkey. - I know, I know, I know. - You got it.. Oh! Son of a bitch! The worst kind of split. ¶ Hey, I'm not here, it's Joey Bird, leave a message. Fuck! Fuck! Hey, Joe! Joey's here. Hey, hey! Kid! You in trouble again? - No, no. Um.. Came to ask your advice. - What advice? Lou Brown, the owner of the Cincinnati Cheetahs, uh.. Came to see me and asked me to play. - Play what? Game seven this Sunday. - Don't play. You know why? 'Cause you're a loser. I'm a loser. Your uncle's a loser. Your grandfather was a loser. The only difference between you and us is you get paid to be a loser. Thanks dad. Hey, don't listen to that nasty old dog. He buried his bone a hundred years ago and he can't remember where the fuck it is. You go play the game. You're a winner. - Thanks. Joey! I've been trying to call you. - Why? Why didn't you pick up your phone? - Why should I pick up my phone? I was worried. - About me? Yeah. - That's new. Anyways.. Let's get out of here. I always worry about you. What did he say to you? - Does it matter? Yes, it does. What did he say to you? - Let's go. Okay, just wait here. - Don't. Just wait here. We're going home together. What did you say to him? - The truth. You don't know anything about the truth. - What, did I hurt his feelings? What is he, a pussy? No. My husband's no pussy. But I'll tell you one thing. You're a cunt. Come on. Let's go. Can't you take a day off? - What? I'm retired. From being an asshole. - What is it with everybody today? Personally, Joe, I see this as a script for a Hollywood movie. Only in Hollywood can this kind of crap happen. The only Hollywood movie I see happening here is a disaster movie. And there will be a disaster because this is real life and what you're going to see here is real life and he will crap out and take the championship with him. ¶ I wonder why sometimes I cry ¶ ¶ I wonder why someday I'll die ¶ ¶ I wonder why I just can't fly ¶ ¶ I wonder all the time ¶ ¶ I wonder why I just can't see ¶ ¶ I wonder why you just left me ¶ ¶ Am I the one that only sees ¶ ¶ I wonder ¶ Lou, I don't know where to start. You know I'm not only a journalist, I'm also a fan. I've been a fan of this guy for so many years. Tom, how long have we known each other? - Many years. People didn't believe you. They called you somebody who was not willing to win a championship. - Wait a minute. You're one of the guys who didn't believe in me. - I believed in you. I believed in Joey. Yeah, but out of the 38 years you were here with me about 15. - And I always believed, like you, in his skill set. I always thought he had the best technique. Brilliant goaltender, he tanks for many years, people think you should get a better goaltender. You stuck with him. I signed a 20-year contract with him. You know that. - Yeah. And he left me after 15 years because he had that problem as you know. Tom, you covered it. You were there. Also, I want to congratulate you and thank you very much for the way that you've treated me. There were so many people doubting and saying I was crazy to even have him on the team but it was you who had the positive look at it and said he's better than we think he is. He had a problem. Let's give him a second chance if he does come back. You said that. I did not work my whole goddamn life to get where I am just to lose. Gentlemen, we play against them tonight. A lot of things I can say. On this paper I got them, I'm throwing it away. You've treated him like a son. We're talking money, we're talking sports. It's about money, but it's not about money in your case. I have to tell you, I spoke to Marcel Dionne before the game and Marcel looked at me You're gonna win today. - He said this to you tonight? You're gonna win today. I said, Marcel, come on. I know you're a great hockey player with Gretzky and Bobby Orr and everybody, but come on. I wish I could be as sure. - What craziness made you do this? 'Cause I'm a nutjob. I'm a nutjob. Game seven.. Joey! - What are you doing here? I came to watch the game. - I appreciate that. I gotta go, I gotta go, thanks. - Good luck... sweetie. Game seven.. Now we can go straight to heaven or you can all go straight to hell. Welcome back. They got kryptonite on their team. Their kryptonite is they got an old fucking goalie. Their goaltender stinks. Get on him. Get on him hard. Alright? Character always wins. Let's go at him, go at him hard, and we win. Now let's do our best to bring a little pride back to this team! Now you sons of bitches go out there and you win! Let's go. Come on. Come on, let's go, boys. ¶ He is the poster boy for loser. He is his own worst enemy. And I don't understand how an old guy like Joey Bird is gonna get in that net - against the New York 21s, one of the best teams to ever take the ice - in the championship and stop the puck. I say no. I know you say no, but you're gonna run for mayor and you're gonna be told no. But I can tell you, Joey Bird is a student of his art. He loves goaltending. He knows how to play. He knows how to play the game to win. All he's gonna have to do is keep his team in the game and he can thank Lou Brown for that. And I'm still disappointed in what you said about him. Bill? You're dreaming but I still love ya. And please welcome back number 35, Joey Bird! ¶ Mr. Brown. - You didn't forget me then, huh? Good seeing you, kid. We're in the seventh game of the championship, you know that. I want you to play in that game. Kid? Don't play. You know why? 'Cause you're a loser. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, please now stand for our national anthem. ¶ Oh, say can you see ¶ ¶ by the dawn's early light ¶ ¶ what so proudly we hailed ¶ ¶ at the twilight's last gleaming ¶ ¶ whose broad stripes and bright stars ¶ ¶ through the perilous fight ¶ ¶ o'er the ramparts we watched ¶ ¶ were so gallantly streaming ¶ ¶ and the rockets red glare ¶ ¶ the bombs bursting in air ¶ ¶ gave proof through the night ¶ ¶ that our flag was still there ¶ ¶ O say does that star spangled banner yet wave ¶ ¶ o'er the land of the free ¶ ¶ and the home of the brave ¶ Well, for every player out there this is their big chance. They've never had this opportunity and here they are. - Well, 37 years in the making, Joe. It's worth it. I know I don't deserve to be here. I know I do not deserve to be here. But please, if not for me, but for my family and the fans of this team and all the hockey players, help me succeed. I don't want to punish this team. I don't want to punish the coach or Mr. Brown, my wife and my father and all the fans here for being a loser. Please. Puck into the New York 21 zone out to center. Back on the 21s. New York... Little bit of pressure by New York. In the zone and he turns the puck over. Dump it deep. Come on, Joe! I'm sorry. Joey, fly high! Back in front, back onto New York, the 21s bring it to center... Scores! Fuck! I mean, that was a beautiful goal. Top cheese. Hey Bird! You suck! ¶ Well, they appear disinterested. I know they aren't, Jim, but they've gotta show more enthusiasm. They've gotta get some drive in their game. They're just wasting time out there and they can't expect Joey Bird to score. ¶ Joey! You got no help, Joey, babe. You got no offense. Son of a bitch. What's he supposed to do, play this whole game himself? Hey Bird! You suck! Hey lady! You ever play hockey? What's it to you? I'm asking! If you ever played hockey you'd shut the fuck up. - Ah, fuck off. Alright, face-off. Cincinnati wins it. Past Bedeka on the far side. Thrown back to the point. Kyle.. Shot! And it's kicked away with a right pad. On to the right side, back on New York. 21s get it to center. Cheetahs trying to turn up ice out of their own zone. Eric Becker after him. Becker behind the net. Puck to center.. Bastasin couldn't get it. New York trying to get the zone. Thrown in front.. And there's a great opportunity for the Cheetahs. Back on the 21s. Puck possession inside the Cincinnati zone. Spun out in front, that's knocked away and back come Cincinnati - the Cheetahs over the line. Here they come again. Here come the Cheetahs. Shoots! And that's stopped. Back comes New York. Played out the right side. Little bit of pressure by Cincinnati. Picked off by Harpur. Back come Cincinnati over the line. Harpur with it. It's Harpur over the line and Harpur spins into the left wing boards.. Circles... after it behind the net. Tries to flip it out, knocked back down. Back come the Cheetahs. And Harpur again with a great opportunity but is stopped in close. And Luke Gazdic with it. Here we go, guys. Here we go, we're coming! It's up to you, Joey! - Joey Bird! Cincinnati to center. They're just gonna play it inside the line. All kinds of possession but nothing getting to the net. The Cheetahs still looking for that goal to get back into this game. They throw to the point.. Back come New York. Here's a two on 0.. Over to the right.. Shot! Bird got a piece of that. That almost found the back of the net. That's my boy! Back come Cincinnati. Cincinnati to center, they're gonna play it inside the line. And the 21s taking care of any rebounds in front of their own goaltender. Played out the side. Shot! And it's kicked away. And that's knocked away. Back toward the left wing boards. Now Kyle.. Konopka on the far side. Back come the Cheetahs. Turned back the other way. Dump it deep. Pass to Medica, on the far side. Thrown back to the point. Puck into the 21s zone up to center. Yashin throws it up the middle, here comes Gazdic! Gazdic.. Oh! That almost found the back of the net. Ready with the face-off. Back come New York.. To center.. The next goal could be a big one.. Back in front and it's fired just wide. Cincinnati to center, they're just gonna play it inside the line. Thrown in front and that's knocked away. Cincinnati looking for their first goal. And Harpur waits. Konopka on the far side, back come the Cheetahs. He's a little shaky right now, but you see how he's playing. - Yeah. Over the line, here come New York. Threw the puck out of their own zone. Off his stick and wide. ..With a slap. Looks back... New York... Dump it deep. Breakaway pass has picked off, turned back the other way. He's kind of shaky. He doesn't seem.. - Got plenty of time. He's covering the net, he's coming out a little too far. I would hope that he stayed back a little. This way he'll have to cover less ground. - He's a little slow. He's slow, yeah. - Resting. But he's coming, he's coming. I got all the confidence in the world in him. Please, give me the strength not to be a coward. Ever. And let me win this game. Let me win this game for all the people who thought they were losers. I want to win this game. Please. Off the face-off again. Puck possession inside the Cincinnati zone. New York trying to get the zone. Thrown back to the point. Over the line. And New York once again. They throw it to the point.. Shot! Bird got a piece of that. Shot! Scores! Oh, man! This might be the last of somebody's career if the Cincinnati Cheetahs don't find a way to get back into this game. - I would say Lou Brown's career. This could be it for the Big Lou. Dammit. We're down two. - The period's almost over. The guys are skating now. - He's looking better. Hey moron! Bird! You're a moron! Lady, will you please shut the fuck up. What's it to you? I've as much right to say anything as you have. Lady, if you do not shut the fuck up, I will tear out your dentures and bite your fucking ass with them! Oh, I don't wear dentures, lady. If you don't shut the fuck up you fucking will! How could I let that in? Oh, fuck. I got the reflexes of a pregnant rhinoceros. Alright, face-off. Cincinnati wins it. And New York once again.. They'll clear the puck out of their own zone. Now Kyle in his zone and he turns the puck over. 21s continue to hold onto it. Harpur... Puck possession inside the Cincinnati zone. Shot! And it's kicked away! The Cincinnati Cheetahs find themselves in some trouble. Very early they find themselves in a hole and they have not been able to climb out of it. ¶ We're joined by Cincinnati Cheetahs owner Lou Brown. And Lou, a lot of people are wondering have you lost your mind putting Joey Bird in goal for the championship game? Well, at this point I'm not quite sure, you know? Everything is sort of in the dark, in sort of a maze, and I'm not sure exactly what's gonna happen. I took a chance but it wasn't really a big chance. I needed somebody, I had two goalies out. I truly had no alternative and the closest thing to a solution I thought was Joey Bird. - You're the owner, you have to make those decisions and you did. You showed compassion for a young man who had lost his way. I admire everything you've done along the way whether you've won 37 or lost 37. You showed Joey Bird another opportunity and I know one thing. Based on my recollections of him as a goalie, he will not let you down. - Listen, Lou. I hate to disagree with my partner Bill here, but you're a sports owner. - Yeah. Your job is to win a championship. How are you gonna do that with a guy who hasn't played since I don't know when? - Well, I'll be honest with you. I think we're gonna find that out relatively soon. And I have faith that he can still play. Sure, he hasn't played in 15 years and it's partly my fault. He left us after 15 years and I didn't find him for a long period of time. I tried reaching out to him and I was unsuccessful. Some people told me he was playing in a beer league so I thought he was still somewhat active. I realized he was past 40 but there was no one that I trusted enough that was free to be my goalie for a championship game that I had any faith in. The faith I had was in Joey. It's just that I believe he can do it. He's told me he can do it. He's probably as unsure as I have been but he has told me. He looked right into my face and he said "Mr. Brown, I promise I'm gonna do everything I can to bring you your first championship". Which of course would have been his first championship as well. So I went with that. I believed. I believe and maybe there's a guy upstairs - or a woman, whoever that is - will allow us to live the dream that we have, both he and I, and the rest of the team. Because, listen, I have a great team. Great offense, great defense - great team. - Your compassion and trust, to me, is what makes this opportunity for Joe Bird. But I gotta tell you, I'm so nervous. And I understand your reason for being somewhat negative but you're being awfully kind even in your negative approach to me and I understand you're a reporter trying to get as much information as possible, but I.. I trust him. And I hope you understand that I'm not a fool. I've been in this business too long, you know, and Marcel Dionne once said to me, he said "Lou, I love you. You're a winner". Of course it's taken me 38 years to get, and hopefully that will happen. - Well, Joe's gonna run for mayor, so we're gonna see how good he is. - Are you really? We'll see about that. Lou, I do admire your faith. I do admire your faith. It's honorable but I just think you're making a big mistake. I've told Billy that, I've told the folks at home. - But you don't have that right just because you're an announcer. I feel like you're making a big mistake but you're gonna do what you're gonna do. You're the owner of the team. It is your right to do what you want to do and I wish you the best of luck and I want to thank you for coming on here and joining us. Can I tell you one last thing? If we don't win, I'm gonna cry like a son of a bitch. Excuse my language, can I say that? - Oh, sure. - You just did, so it's okay. Thanks for joining us. - Thanks Lou. Alright, here we go. Cincinnati again. Back to the middle of the ice. Puck zone to center. It bounces. Cheetahs trying to turn it out of their own zone. Over to the right! Shot! Bird got a piece of it! What a save! They've got a big mountain to climb, that's for sure. And I really can't say I like their chances. Alright, back under way. Cincinnati wins it. New York. Puck possession inside the Cincinnati zone. That's knocked away. New York once again. Back in front and that's fired just wide. Tries to flip it out, knocked back down. Dump it deep. Cincinnati Cheetahs. Down it's gonna go to a face-off to the left. Now the Cincinnati Cheetahs goaltender Joey Bird... Alright, back under way. Puck into the New York 21s zone, out to center. Liambas drops it. Left side, thrown in front. And Zenon Konopka almost knocked that in. Back comes Yashin. Yashin on a two-on-one break. Yashin drops it for Harpur. Harpur's attempt in front goes off his stick. Yashin tracks it down to the right wing corner. Yashin throws it in front. Long shot by Becker. That's kept out by Colton Incze. - They've at least gotten themselves into the game a little, Jim, which is encouraging if you're a Cheetah fan like you and Joe. There's Liambas. Liambas over the line. Liambas in front - oh! Off the goalpost. Oh, my! Come on, Joey! Come on! Come on, Joey! He's looking good. It's gonna be alright. You got confidence in him, right? - Mm hm. So do I. And I think the team does too. - Yeah. Look how they're reacting around him. Look how defensively they're playing around him. - Well, he could get a little help from the fucking team too. Defense is looking good. Maybe if the offense picks up a little bit we'll be on our way. I'm not worried. No, I'm scared, shit. Trying to turn up ice out of their own zone. Puck to center. Bastasin couldn't get it deep. Medica now picks it up.. Gets it to Kyle. Back to the middle - Medica with a shot! And that's taking the midsection and held on so the Cheetahs still looking for that goal that would give them some hope to mount a comeback and get back into this game. Well, we talked about it off the top, Jimmy. You can only expect so much from Joey Bird. One of the things you have to do is to protect him by getting yourself back in the game. Take some pressure off your goalie. Back on the 21s. New York. Puck possession inside the Cincinnati zone. Spun out in front, that's knocked away and back come Cincinnati, the Cheetahs. He's a little shaky right now, but... You see how he's playing? He's not as fancy as he used to be, but remember, 15 years he hasn't played. And I want to thank you personally because I knew the moment I saw you - I was surprised to see you - but if it wasn't for you he wouldn't be here. I know he was doing me a favor but you prompted him to do it. I owe you. He wasn't doing you any favors, you saved his life. - Believe me, I didn't. But thank you. Mishandled by Kyle on the far side. Kyle throws it in behind the net. And Luke Gazdic with it. Gazdic, back to the point. Harpur... Harpur waits. Harpur hooks off his skate, and Gazdic's gonna have to go back and get it. Time becoming a factor. Back come Cincinnati over the line. Two-on-two break... sharp angle - and throw it in the side of the net. And that's knocked away. And the New York 21s have done a great job of taking care of any rebounds, any garbage in front of their own goaltender. - Exactly what the Cheetahs have to pick up on, Jim. They're not doing a good job of clearing in front of the net, although, in fairness, they've been better in the second period. Joey, go! Yeah! Here they come again. Konopka's open in front, here's the pass, redirected and that goes just past the outstretched pad of Joey Bird and wide. Back comes Gasdic. Here come the Cheetahs. Gasdic over the line - shoots! And that's stopped. So the lead that the Cincinnati Cheetahs are trying to cut into remains, as Cincinnati looking for their first goal. So all of a sudden you go from Joey Bird being the story early on giving up a couple.. Now the story is the Cincinnati Cheetahs unable to find themselves back in this game. Paid a fortune for that guy. With a little traffic up front we could take some more shots! Well, they're starting to resemble the Cincinnati Cheetahs team that made it this far. - Yeah, they're showing something in the second that they certainly didn't in the first, Joe. - Another shot. Face-off gonna be to the left. So game seven, you can feel the tension in this building. Go Joe! Eat em up! Eat 'em up, Joe! They know if New York gets another one back the other way this game is done. Cincinnati needs something good to happen, whether it's from the hockey gods or whether it's from one of their skilled players. Behind the net Yashin now tries to get it. Picked off by Ryan Wells, played out the right side. Over the line.. Here come New York. Long shot - Oh, that's off the goalpost! Oh, my. That's three that have found their way past Joey Bird and off the goalpost. Yashin now. For the Cheetahs. Yashin circles in the front of the net. Spins back towards the left wing board. Yashin in the corner. Back in front and Yashin can't handle that. And New York once again will clear the puck out of their own zone. Liambas gets to center. Offense! Come on, offense! One on three but Liambas holds onto it. Gets into the slot, looks back, throws it across to Chris Harpur. Alright, get back, defense! Get back! Help him out! Shit! He's got no help! Harpur with it. Time becoming a factor here as the Cincinnati Cheetahs find themselves in some trouble. And the story of the game was Joey Bird. Could he hold them in it? He has since the 21s took the early lead. Fuck! Fuck! Well, he's certainly done as well if not better than the general consensus would have expected. Joey Bird has been a significant part of this game. As we pointed out, he can't score so the game's over. If the Cheetahs don't decide to play more like a team and take a facsimile from the New York 21s.. They're dead meat! - Well, right now this has turned into a nice story. But if you want this to be the thing that legends are made of, there has to be a comeback. Joey Bird has been solid since they fell down early in this game. The crowd was on him, he responded well and the team responded well around him. But now is the time for them to find a way to get back into this game. And unfortunately for Joey Bird, whether you think it's right or wrong, he's gotta be the story of the third period. He's gotta be absolutely perfect. - Well, he can't let any more goals in. That's a pressure that nobody needs, Jim. But that's a pressure that comes with a team that didn't come to play. For the Cheetahs, Yashin circles in the front of the net. There's Alexei Yashin over the line - rebound - scores! Yashin, over the line right off the face-off. Walks in, first shot is stopped. Yashin follows it up and Yashin slips it into the goal. Is this the start of something special for the Cincinnati Cheetahs? - I'm looking down the tunnel. I see a flicker of light there, Jim. It's pretty faint, I must say. - What's the old saying: is it a train or is it daylight? And we knew at the start of this period for them to get back into this game, they're gonna have to start taking some chances. The defense are gonna have to pinch, forwards might have to cheat a bit leaving the zone. It's gonna create scoring chances at one end but we could see, because of that, teams trading scoring chances at both ends. I can tell you this, Jimmy, without any equivocation: Next goal wins. That's all I'm telling you. Back in front and that's fired just wide. Yashin can't get into the corner. Back come the 21s. Liambas throws it to center but Yashin back to Harpur, back in over the other way. Harpur in front - shot! And that's kicked away. The defense around him isn't as strong as I would hope, but they're not bad. They seem to be coming together. How do you feel? - I feel great. Are you proud of him? - Yeah. 15 years, honey. It's been a long time. You have the confidence? You feel the way I do? - Shut up. We're gonna see how this plays out. Is this gonna be decided by one final bounce? Another goalpost, as Joey Bird has had a few of them to keep him in this game. Back into the slot - shot off his skate. Now Kyle in the zone and he turns the puck over. Cheetahs again! There's Alexei Yashin, had trouble handling it.. Kept in again. Harpur.. Picked up by Yashin, tries to flip it out, knocked back down. Konopka on the far side. Back come the Cheetahs. Breakaway pass, picked off, turned back the other way. New York. Dump it deep. They're just trying to kill time off this clock now. We said at the very start of this game that this was a game that was gonna be talked about for years to go. So again, come back. Alexei Yashin. Yashin back to center, throws it up the middle. Here comes Gasdic. Two on 0. Gasdic gets it - oh! What a great opportunity for Gasdic stolen with a blocker save. Gasdic keeps it deep. Yashin goes to the front of the net. Yashin makes a pass - scores! Gasdic has scored again! This game is tied! Has tied this game. - I mean, that was a beautiful goal. Top cheese. Here we go again. It's Harpur over the line and Harpur spins into the left wing boards. Throws it way out in front and it bounces! Passed to Medica on the far side. Thrown back to the point. Bastasin throws it into the middle of the ice and another shot by Medica. That was harmless and swallowed up. And the face-off is gonna be to the right of the New York 21's goal. Cincinnati Cheetahs back in this game. They looked like they were absolutely done in the early goings of this hockey game. - This is really one of the greatest comebacks I can remember. Harpur - Harpur throws it in front. Kyle - shot and it's kicked away with a right pad. Back into the slot. Right in front. Shot once, rebound.. And Harpur again with a great opportunity but is stopped in close. Back come New York. 21s get it to center, stolen by Yashin. Yashin, thrown to the right side. Eric Becker after it. Becker behind the net. Becker tries to throw it in front - shot by Justin Kyle - off his stick and wide. That almost found the back of the net. Come on, take a shot! Take a shot! Back come the Cheetahs. Alexei Yashin. Yashin to center. Yashin's got Harpur with him. Kyle trailing... oh! And Yashin.. Off the left pad. This game is getting late. Come on, ref! What about that? Hey, ref! Open your eyes, will ya? Come on, you're missing a good game! We've said it a few times. The next goal could be a big one. Alexei Yashin wants to make sure it's off his stick again. Here's Becker in the corner. Yashin throws it in front. Kyle in the far corner, they throw it to the point. It's knocked down. Back come New York. Here's a two on 0 - a two on 0 for the New York 21s. Over to the right - shot! Bird might have got a piece of that. - Yeah, for sure. New York, another odd man rush and Joey Bird turns 'em away. Come on, guys! Change, change, change! Cheetahs have not led in this game. Puck thrown to center. McLean can't handle it. It bounces. Johnson falls. Joey, fly high! Picked up, it is a two-on-0 break the other way. There's a shot at Joey Bird. Bird got a piece of it. Oh, baby! Joey Bird just gets his stick on it or this game is back in the hands of the New York 21s. Bird with perhaps his best stop of the night. - Joey Bird's kept them in the game the last 30 seconds, Jimmy. Back come Cincinnati. ¶ Yashin.. Yashin.. Shot! Scores! Score - Alexei Yashin down the right wing. Oh, what a night he's had! Bird at one end, Yashin at the other. - Isn't it funny, Jimmy, how they make a big save at the far end, they come down and score to tie. Joey Bird is doing what he has to do: keep his team in the game by making saves and hope that Yashin and the crew can continue to put them in. I think the amazing thing for game seven is how wide open things have turned here in the third period. - Yeah, it's redefined game seven, I think, Jim. - The Cheetahs had a completely changed method of play. They were just dead in the water. - Yeah, I think Yashin picked them up by the scruff of the neck, Joe, and showed them what had to be done. You lead by example. - What does New York have left? One last chance as we get into the final minute. Empty net. Cincinnati. Cheetahs can't do anything. New York dumps it in. They got the extra man on the ice. Can Bird hold the fort? Thrown in front.. And that's knocked away. Harpur on the far side. Harpur holding. Harpur trying to get it to the front of the net. Harpur in behind the goal, thrown in front, picked off. Back come Cincinnati to center. They're just gonna play it inside the line. Wells with it. Wells' time running out. Here's Curran. Curran on the right wing side to Liambas. Wells with a shot - the shot is blocked. And they've done it! They've done it! They've done it! The Cincinnati Cheetahs with Joey Bird in goal. - What an accomplishment for what that man's been through and what he's done tonight. ¶ I wonder why sometimes I cry ¶ ¶ I wonder why some day I'll die ¶ ¶ I wonder why I just can't fly ¶ ¶ I wonder all the time ¶ ¶ I wonder why I just can't see ¶ ¶ I wonder why you just left me ¶ Joey, I'm so proud of you. ¶ Am I the one that only sees ¶ ¶ I wonder ¶ Tonight he had the post as his friend, there was no question. But he was there at the most important times. Before the winning goal was scored he made a superb save and down they came.. The Cheetahs came down to score the winner. - What did we expect out of Lou Brown? A decision that was going to win a championship. Naysayers are not coming into this game. He proved that he made the right one. How'd you manage to do that? That was a winner. Thank you, guys. Thank you very much. - Congratulations. - Thank you. ¶ ¶ ¶ Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.. Your champions the Cincinnati Cheetahs! Where's Joey? - Joey's with his dad. ¶ I wonder ¶ ¶ do you know that I love you ¶ ¶ I wonder if you can see ¶ I'm so sorry I doubted you. ¶ I'm the one for you and you're the one for me ¶ Thank you for giving me a chance, Mr. Brown.

I've had to get along with me and I'm the guy when I wake up in the morning I gotta deal with myself all day. Life.. What is it? What is the meaning of life? Is that profound or is that a cliche? Is that something in a drink with a little umbrella? 'Cause I don't understand it. Maybe I'm not that smart. Maybe I didn't see it on CNN or CNBC. ¶ Why have I become frozen in my own cocoon? ¶ ¶ What do I believe it means for me ¶ ¶ to be a better soul? ¶ ¶ Please help me see more than me ¶ ¶ please help me be the one you want me to be ¶ everyone in the world walks around all day staring at their smart phone which is really some fucked up shit because it makes no sense 'cause the more you look at your smart phone you seem to get more stupider, more dumber, and more lonely. There's no such thing as an app that's gonna grab you and make you understand what it means to have that precious moment where you're alive. But you got no choice. You get seduced by your own stupidity. You get seduced by your own needs because you believe you are the center of the universe. You're hypnotized by your own shit. You're hypnotized by everything that you need to be. But you don't understand. There's a positive and a negative. And without those two terminals there is no energy. I want to make you understand that you're walking in a shroud of darkness. I want you to understand. Can I see more than I could be? Can I be the one you want me to be? ¶ I woke up Saturday morning to the sounds that I know outside my window some kids playing in the snow a homemade net and a tennis ball is all they need to play the only game I'm gonna see today 'cause all the big rinks have gone dry and we're all left wondering why there's no one left to cheer for there's no one there to hear us when we're shouting go team go we used to cheer for Wendel or Lindros and Lemieux Lafleur, Messier and the Great One too and now we cheer for Tucker, Iginla, Roberts and Balfour and Coach's Corner on the CBC now all the big rinks have gone dry and we're left to wonder why there's no one left to cheer for there's no one there to hear us when we're shouting go team go when we're shouting go team go ¶ ¶ it's Saturday night and the boys are all here and just like we've always done but there's nothing to watch this year so we grab our sticks and hats and head out in the snow you take center and I'll take goal we'll play the game that we all love we're playing for all the memories and the good times yet to come and we'll find something to cheer for the whole world's gonna hear us can you hear us?
