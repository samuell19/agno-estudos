No. I like to have my typewriter. John loves me and I love him, but we can't talk. We are... ... shy. Why don't you tell him you like him ? I don't like him, I love him. Why don't you tell him you love him ? It's sad. I want to say it to him and he wants to say it to me, but we can't. We are shy. You could go ice-skating with him. He plays ice hockey. I don't know. You can go with me ? No, I have to study. But, Thuy, you are my friend, you need to help me. I'm saving money for a book that I want. What book ? The PSAT book. What is PSAT ? It's a practice SAT. The SAT is a test and if you do good, you go to a college that you want, or a good one. College is when you're an adult. I take it in the eighth grade, only if you're an honor student. But you're in sixth grade. But if I start studying now, I'll get a high score on the SAT. That's stupid. I don't care. Welcome to the Regal ice-skating rink. ... no sitting, no climbing on the railings, no straight shooting on the ice, no pushing or shoving, no foul language. Thank you for skating with us.

I told you that I love John and you told me that you have a secret. I don't remember it. You were going to tell me what boy you love, that's your secret. Is it Alex ? No. Alex is cute. Alex is a lazy bum. Alex is funny. I love Alex. I thought you loved John. I do, but I also love Alex. You're a two-timer. What's a two-timer ? Someone who cheats on their boyfriend. I don't have a boyfriend. But I thought you loved John. I do, but I also love Alex. Maybe you can write it down and then you don't have to say his name. Write his name. If I write it down, my dad will find it. You can burn it with fire, then. Where are you gonna burn it ? Outside. After 5:00, my dad goes to work. You read it in the bathroom. After that, you rip it up into little pieces and flush it down the toilet. Okay. Are you sure you don't want to tell me what's in the box ? My dad said we can't play with it. But I can only look. I don't want to play, just look. My dad said no, you can't look either. You're smiling. You're smiling. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. You're smiling, you're lying. No, I'm not. I can read it in your eyes. Don't play, don't touch, don't look. You can't even smell it. That's silly. You're silly. Thank you. That's not a compliment. I know. If you have a birthday party, we can invite boys we love. My dad said I can't. Ask him. What did he say ? He said no. I didn't study enough. You ask again later ? My father's really strict. When he says no, it's a no. That's small. You can't talk about it. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. You want to sleep at my house ? I have to ask my dad first. You ask him now ? Okay, one minute. He said that I can't sleep at your house, but you can sleep here if you want. Is your refrigerator running ? You better run after it ! Oh, wow. What do you think it's like to kiss a boy ? I don't know, I never thought about it. Then think about it right now. You can't look at me. Done. You're done ? It-- It was like two seconds. So ? You're done ? Yes, that's it. Why did your family leave Vietnam ? There was a war. There was a war ? Your dad didn't want to be a soldier ? My dad wasn't a soldier. Then why did you leave ? We left because in Israel, everybody has to be a soldier or you go to jail, and my parents thought the war was wrong. That's good. That's not good, it's bad. I'm glad you had to come here, because we got to meet. My uncle was a soldier, and another Israeli soldier shot him by accident. He was my mom's little brother and now my mom cries whenever it's Friday. Did anybody you know die in Vietnam ? Shlomit, thank you for sending another picture of Chava Alberstein. I don't listen to her anymore, but maybe Daniel will want it. Allo ? Uh, he is not home. Yes, I'm sorry. He home... He home later. Yes. Okay, okay. Thuy, my parents said that I can go to this camp this summer. Would you ask your parents and go with me ? I don't like summer camp. Why ? You didn't even look. Yes, I have. No, you didn't. Yes, I have. Then what's the name of the camp ? Well, I might not see that one, but I saw other ones. Maybe you'll like this one better. I don't like going to summer camp. My dad said I have to study for the PSAT. PSAT is when you're in high school. Why don't you ever have any fun ? I have fun. Then go to camp with me this summer. We can have a sleepover every night. My dad won't let me. You didn't even ask him. Yes, I have. But you said you didn't like to go to camp. Then why did you even ask him ? You just don't want to go because you don't want to be with me. You'll just do what your dad tells you to do your whole life and just study for the stupid PSAT. I don't care. Fine. Fine. Ellie. I'm sorry that I lied to you all the time. I never had a friend like you, so I'm deciding I'll never lie to you again. Remember when I asked my dad to have a birthday party ? He said I could have one, but I don't want a birthday party because everyone in school lives in a house, like the kind John has, and I live in an apartment. Please rip up this note after you read it and never talk about it with me. If you talk about it, I won't be able to be friends with you. I wrote us a secret code so that we don't have to worry about blabbermouths. Each third letter is a "B" so that if you cross out all of the "B"s, you can read out the secret code. But don't read it now.

One, Ellie and Thuy have to spend at least ten minutes together at every recess. Two, Ellie and Thuy have to take a walk together in the woods at least once a week. Three, if one has a secret, she has to tell the other one and the other one can't tell anyone in the world. Four, if one calls the other one on the phone, then the other one has to call back that day. Five, because they are best friends forever, they agree that when they grow up, they will always live next to each other or in the same house, if husbands agree. Done ? You should put it in a good place so that you don't lose it. Don't fold it like that. It'll be fine. When you fold a piece of paper, it's harder to read it. I can read it. But when you're grown up, you won't be able to read it. I'll straighten it out when I get home. You can't straighten a piece of paper after it's folded. Yes, I can. No, you can't. I can, I've done it before. Well, let me see you do it. I don't want to. Because you can't. Yes, I can. No, you can't. Then let me see you do it. Let me type you another one that's not folded. I don't want another one, I want this one. Fine. Fine. Sometimes, I wish I was in a car accident and had amnesia. Then I would remember everything but Hebrew and won't have to speak it. I don't think you should forget Hebrew. If we have boyfriends, we'll be more popular. But I don't want to be popular. Yes, you do. No, I don't. Don't you want everybody to invite you to their birthday party ? No. Hi. Wanna go ice skating together ? Thuy, I was so stupid. I thought that I loved John, but I really love Matthew. Why do you love Matthew ? Because I love him. Ellie, you're a two-timer. I'm no two-timer, Thuy. Yes, you are. I'm not a two-timer. Two-timer ! Am not ! Yes, you are. Am not ! When are you ever gonna learn ? I'm not a two-timer ! I'm not a two-timer ! Ellie. Is it true that you and Matthew skated together ? Yes. That's cool. Thank you. Mary wanted to ask you something. No, I didn't. Yes, you did, you told me. No, I didn't. Yes, you did. She wanted to know if all girls from Israel are ugly. Do you want to come over ? I have to take care of my brother and my sisters and then do my homework. We don't have any homework. I have to study. For what ? The stupid PSAT ? No, for math. We don't have a math quiz. Thuy... I always call you but you never call me. A friendship has to be 50%, 50%. Why don't you call me ? Aren't we best friends ? We had an agreement. When do we want it ? Now ! We want fun-- when do we want it ? Now ! We do need a good education, you know. We really do, am I right ? Are you sad ? No. Are you sure ? You look sad. I'm sure, I'm not sad. You look like you lost something. Did you lose anything important ? No, why ? Nothing. I have to go home and finish my homework. Okay. Bye. Bye. Thuy, yesterday I took the shrinkydink that we made to see if you would miss it. And then when I asked you if you lost anything, you said no and you laughed. I didn't know if you said that it was missing and you were laughing because you were happy, but I think you were better than that. But it hurts too much to be best friends with someone who doesn't want to, so I'm saying goodbye to you. In school, please don't ask me about this and please don't call to talk because we talk and talk and nothing changes. And please don't worry about me. When we see each other in school, we should act the way any two people act in school and nothing more. Goodbye. Ellie. Hi there, Ellie. How are you ? Fine, thank you, and how are you ? I'm good. Very well, thank you. How are you doing on your spelling these days ? Okay. Why don't we try a few words ? Can you spell "book" ? B-O-O-K. Very good. And "chair" ? I hate this food. Sort of-- I sort of like it, though. Arrest him, he pushed me down. Help me ! Arrest him ! Hey. I'm having a Michael Jackson-themed birthday party. Do you want to come ? Maybe. I'm gonna have all different flavor ice creams, I'm even gonna have strawberry. I like strawberry, also. So do I, but I like the ones that have the strawberry chunks in them. Thuy doesn't like birthday parties because her parents work in a factory and she lives in an apartment. So is it Saturday or Sunday night ? Saturday night. What flavor cake do you like ? I like ice-cream cake. So do I, but I also like regular cake, so I'm gonna have both. That's a good idea. What flavor is your favorite ? I like vanilla, but I also like chocolate. Elisheva. Go away. Go away ! Bye ! Hi. I got you a present.
