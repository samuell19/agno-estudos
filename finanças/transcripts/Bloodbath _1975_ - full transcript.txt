When I play, I always win. [same song on record] [music off] I'll bet you thought my name was Treasure, huh? Yeah. Treasure Evans, just like the rest of the world thought. My fans, my public. Betcha thought that there were my parents, looking down at this cuddly little baby saying, oh, isn't she a treasure? Why don't we call it that? Well, that ain't the way it happened. Nope. There I was, on my lovely little 16-year-old backside. Or was I on my belly? I really don't remember. Well, anyway, right side up or upside down, there I was, stretched out on the casting couch. Oh, yeah. They had casting couches. And there was this-- that ugly old producer. Well, he was important. I don't know, he was more than a producer. He was like a studio head. And he says to me, Mary-- that's my real name, Mary-- at any rate, there he is looking down at me. And he was drooling. And he says, Mary, you're Treasure. Well, not long after that, I became a star. Big house in Beverly Hills. I had a swimming pool, three pictures a year to do, jewelry. Oh, good jewelry. And telephones-- telephones everywhere. Ding-a-ling-a-ling, a-ling-a-ling, a-ling-a-ling. Hello? Hello? My telephone voice. Hello? This is Treasure Evans. Hello, Chicken. Hello, Chicken. CHICKEN: How long have I been here? Oh. Yesterday. Yeah, yesterday morning. I found you lying on the beach. You must have been there a long time. You OK? Oh. Oh, wow. Did you really think even for a moment that I took advantage of your condition to bring you up here? Oh, wow. You've got a lot to learn. Boy, I've known losers. God knows how many. And another thing. You're too old for me. [bells tolling] [crowd chanting in spanish] Shit. [chanting continues] HEATHER: Why is it called Good Friday? Why is what? HEATHER: Good Friday. Why is it called Good Friday? Didn't you hear me? My question is, if it really is, or rather represents the day he was crucified, then why is it called-- good God, aren't you dressed yet? You're beautiful. Do you know that, old girl? Would you like to go to bed with me? Again? We, um, just tried that and it didn't work. Have you forgotten? Hm? Bitch. [chuckling] That's why I wondered why it was called Good Friday. Put your pants on, love. We'll be late for the fiesta. [honking] Out of my way, you stupid [inaudible]! [continued honking] Happy holidays! Bang. Bang, bang, bang. Bang, bang, bang! [elaborate horn] Well, here she comes. Among our little group, no gathering would be complete without its token fading rose! TERENCE: Bombs away! A line from one of my old movies. Whoop! HEATHER: I didn't see that one. [all chuckling] ALLAN: This is Luella Parsons. Hello from Hollywood. Arriving now in a gown by Edith Headache is Treasure Evans. Hello, pets. HEATHER: Hello, dearie. Everyone in a festive mood? I hope so. Chicken, I never saw you look so clean. I honest to god am in the mood for a festival. Isn't it lovely to feel lovely? Oh, Heather, what a dear little dress. No, this is a dead little dress. I try. God knows she tries. You look lovely too, Alice. I think that's the important thing, that we all try. I mean, even though we are expatriates. Treasure, please do not use the word expatriate. I'm not expatriate. I simply live abroad. (SINGING) Up in the air, Junior Birdman. Up in the air, upside down-- You're my favorite musician, baby. Showtime. Spotlight on Chicken. Is that bit of silliness directed at me, Chicken? [shrieking] Must you? After that entrance I made, I deserve to have the spotlight on me! Give me Ziegfeld Pink on Treasure Evans. It's moments like that, which along with Annette Funicelli and Sandra Dee, have made you one of my favorite actresses. And you, one of my favorite fags. BOTH: Mwah! Buenas noches. TREASURE: God, look at him. He must be getting hard up. ALLAN: Hard bought. [both chuckling] Happy Good Friday! [interposing voices] So? Vas? Herr Commandant does not drink with Germans? Sieg Heil! [chuckling] I don't find that amusing. You are a soldier, no? I don't remember the war. I was born during the war. I don't know who my father was. He was a soldier. A British soldier. Maybe you're my father. You, my daddy. I drink to my unknown father! BOTH SINGING: Oh, the Souse family is the best family that ever came over from old Germany. So drink, chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug-- [glass breaking] I want to make a toast. To crucifixion. Resurrection. [all laughing] That's sacrilegious. No, it isn't. Well, it's not proper. Proper? Oh, my god, Heather. What is proper? Her pearls. Real pearls. Now, that's proper. But they are real. That's what I said. They're real. Nothing's real. Everything's permitted. What is that? A quote. ALLAN: Too much. Too much! [inaudible] what I said. From the philosophy of the assassins. [laughing] That's a weird Eastern cult. They smoke hash-- all that garbage that he's into. Then when they are properly stoned, high, they-- TERENCE: Stoned? Disgusting. They go around killing people. And then they commit suicide. Suicide? They believe they're born again. TERENCE: Tut with the heavenly hodgepodge. ALLAN: And then they come back. Pure, cleansed. Like from the steam baths. [all laughing] No. Like from the crucifixion. Are you washed in the blood of the lamb? CROWD SINGING: Have you been to Jesus for the cleansing power? Are you washed in the blood of the lamb? Are you fully trusting in his grace this hour? Are you washed in the blood of the lamb? Are you washed in the blood, in the soul-cleansing of the lamb? Yea, of the lamb! Are your garments spotless? Are they white as snow? Are they washed in the blood of the lamb? Lay aside the garments that are stained with sin and be washed in the blood of the lamb. There's a fountain flowing for the soul unclean. Talk about Easter baskets. I haven't seen anything so beautiful since I left Louisiana. CROWD: Are you washed in the blood, in the soul-cleansing blood-- Allan, you're a common whore. A whore? Yes. Common? No. And you, dear Terence, decorated wing command, OBE, and so forth, should be the first to recognize that. CROWD: In the soul-cleansing blood of the lamb. I beg your pardon? ALLAN: You must have some brandy. Hello. My name is Kerry Nation. [animal squealing] [singing in spanish] Hello, Chicken. You know my name? Would you like to dance with me?

[chuckling] Is he pissed? I beg your pardon? [giggling] Happy landing, my dear. Oh, no thank you. I don't drink alcoholic beverages. I'm knocked up, you see. Whee! Tomas. Tomas! Oh! [chuckling] Do you write poetry or something? No. Not anymore. That woman. Huh? Your girl, what does she do? Nothing either, except being hung up on white guys. And I happen to be the only one available. [chuckling] What are you looking for? Nothing. Good. Why do you ask? There isn't anything to be looking for, is there? [chuckling] Would did you do that for? What do you mean? You stopped. I want to see you when you come. Go on. Eh. Ride on, like a big motion picture show stud. After that interruption? I'll come on. [chuckling] Don't laugh at me. Come here. [continued chanting] [cat meowing] What's that? My pill. It's a little late for that, isn't it? Not that pill. Cough drops. It's cough drops? Mm-hmm. - You got a cold? - No. I just like cough drops. That's nice. I like girls that like cough drops. [chuckling] I like cough drops. I like to taste you. [cats meowing] [howling] [bells ringing] Gracias. Oh, god. Why have those damned bells been ringing all morning? Little boy, native, drowned in the fountain. That is for whom the bells toll. Terrible. Give me a fag. Do you want something? Yes. Something hot and black. I would have thought you already had that. Mm. I would have thought so too, but that ain't the way it happened. Hey, Carl, two coffees, huh? Americano. Yeah, yeah. Two Americanos. Dos cafes Americanos. I took him home, bedded him down between clean white sheets and a mosquito net, and, uh-- And, and, and? And I watched him sleep all night. Grr. He-- he looked like an angel. Asleep. My muscle man walked me home. You scored? He walked me to the door and very, very gently kissed me good night. I felt like I was 14 years old again. I may throw up. Hi. Oh. Well, good morning. - Join us. Thanks. ALLAN: In something. Everything. Coffee. What all do angels have for breakfast anyway? Bacon and manna? Ha, ha. Angels? Alice in Wonderland and I have decided that you aren't real. And that's a fact. There are no facts. You see, here we sit, day after day, bored stiff with one another. And then suddenly you come along, unexpected and quite by accident. - There are no accidents. You know, I don't understand a word she says. Well, she means you get what you want out of life. Nothing's accidental. Ha. I never got what I wanted out of life. All I ever wanted was to be a good wife and mother. [chuckling] Even as a little girl, I wanted to be a nurse. ALLAN: I can just see you carrying a bed pan. TREASURE: I did too want to be a nurse. ALLAN: With good furs and dependable servants? A little boy drowned. [chanting] [bells tolling] HEATHER: A bit young for you, isn't she? What are you mumbling about? HEATHER: That little slant-eyed slut you're getting yourself all groomed up to impress. Don't talk nonsense. Oh, you will tell her about your military career. I don't have to brief you about that, do I? Go to hell. You'll be boring at least two generations now with what a bloody little hero you were, how many missions you successfully flew? Ooh, accomplished. Your medals, your decorations. Your cock-- and bull stories. Particularly bull. You're drunk. And you're not drinking this morning. It's not necessary to begin the day with Scotch. Oh, I suppose not. However, it was necessary yesterday, wasn't it? Heather. Go ahead and make a damn fool of yourself. You better go the whole way. Wear that. Really, give her the works. Wing commander Terence Brandon, sir. Aye aye, sir. Yes, sir. Whatever you say, sir. Ex-wing commander Brandon, I think it's about time, if I may say so, darling-- I think it's about time someone told you, sir, that the god damn war is over! Oh. You've never done that. Why did you hit me? (SINGING) Land of hope and glory. Mother of the free. [sobbing] How can we extol thee, we who are born of thee. What? You have to take the first step. I can't just give it to you. You look beautiful like that. What? I said you look beautiful like that. I can't hear you. I said I want to rape you. Then you should! What? I said then you should. I can't hear you! Then you should! [music playing] [army drums] You're too young to know about the war. What war? World War II, of course. Keep your eyes on the road. [continued army drums] They were damn good days. Were you, you know, a hero type? You know, John Wayne? Aren't you eating? No. I have to watch my figure. [whistling] It's true. What if a frog come along and wanted to screw me? I could turn him back into a prince. Well, I ain't no prince. You ain't no frog either, baby. Because frogs hop to it. A toast? Here's to it. We all do it. Even the birds that fly. Bees do it and die. Dogs do it and stick to it. So why can't you and I? At least-- why can't we try? Now, little boy, that was me. And that too. And oh-- hey, you mean to say you never saw me in a movie at all? How old are you? No, no, no, no, no, no, don't answer. I don't think I want to know. You just stay there and be naked. Yes. Oh, young and beautiful and naked. It's very important. To be young and newly born, very, very important. TERENCE: You're so young. Mm-hmm. Innocent. What do you mean? Isn't that what people of your generation, the preceding generation, always say about the following? Young and innocent. TREASURE: So I got out, split-- bye-bye Hollywood-- while the getting out was good. And I took all that lovely money I made with me. Oh, you know, people are always asking me. They say, Treasure, why did you give it all up, all that glamor and all that-- one, two, three, four. I mean, it wasn't like what people thought it was like. It was-- it was different than you think it was. I could go back tomorrow if I wanted to. I mean, every day I get letters, telegrams, phone calls, offers. Gosh, my agent-- my agent, Buzz Lewis, is one of the biggest freelance-- well, he is the biggest freelance agent in Hollywood, you know? And he calls me nearly every day with offers. But I'm waiting, you know, just for the right thing. Something special, special material, hm? You know my song, huh? [music playing] Hear that? That is me. Treasure Evans' theme song. Mm. Whenever they hear that song anywhere in the world, do you know who they think of? They think of me. Mm. My big moment. See, I come down the staircase, this gorgeous set. And I am in a silver lame dress, with yards and yards and yards of white fox fur. And they gave me-- the studio gave me that white fox fur when the film was over. (SINGING) To make use of what nature bestows-- You think I'm dead, don't you? You think they don't want me back. Well, that's not true. My phone is ringing off the wall. The agents, the studios-- they keep calling me all the time. And Buzz Lewis keeps calling me all the time. [phone ringing] Hello? Hello. Hello. Hello! Who is there? Buzz? God damn you. Who are you? Why do you keep teasing me? Who are you? What do you want from me? I'm sorry. It's so-- [sobbing] Someone keeps calling, and there's no one. There's never anybody there. [sobbing] [music playing] SINGER: I'm no babe in the wood, and my plans are laid good. Don't have time for no kind of small fry. Got my cards on the table. I'm willing and able, and my limit is the sky. Form a line on my right, 'cause tonight is the night. I'll separate the boys from the men. Temperature's rising up. Little me is wise enough. When I play, I always win. It's a natural thing to give love a fling. To make use of what nature bestows. Oh, my favorite attraction is a big satisfaction. When one rises, uh-huh, everything goes. When I'm caught in the middle and have need of a little very special remedy, I just send out the call and men naturally fall. The heat turns on, the lid blows off, roll back the latches, open up the hatches, nature is a-calling, the sky is falling, and ready or not, boys, everything goes. [inaudible].

Sometimes I-- I think I came from it. I feel very close to it, very close. I love it. I love you. How? Gently. Like an old-fashioned way. Flowers. Candlelight. Roses. Sunrise. It's like-- like poetry. You know, words. Your own? For I am not a winters man and cannot like this coming storm. But when it comes, I'll be there. And you may laugh. I'll understand. For I am a summers man. When did you write that? A long time ago. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. 10. Fire. [gunfire] [meowing] Terry. [bell tolling] Was he pissed?

We were all right until you came. We were happy, you devil. You freak. What do you want? What do you want? Hey, lady. I don't want nothing. What's happening to us? Oh my god, what's happening to us? I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I-- I didn't mean-- I'm sorry. Heather, wasn't Terence pissed again? No. He was not. ALLAN: Heather. Yes. He was pissed. Leave them alone, and they will come home dragging their-- behind them. Carl, get me another Scotch. Double. Oh, I feel alive again. That's probably a bad line from a bad movie. But I don't care. And I don't care if the telephone don't ever ring again. And I don't care if they're never are any telegrams again or no agents ever call again, because I'm alive! Alive! [phone ringing] Ring away. You son of a bitch. I don't need you anymore. [phone ringing] Hey, I'm going to give a party, a celebration. A crazy celebration with everybody. Very democratic. I'm going to invite even the peasants. No, especially the peasants. And I'll wear my silver gown, the one that I wore in that film. And up to my ass in white fox fur. I'll show them who Treasure Evans is. Terry? Terry? Terry! Terry! Terry! (ECHOING) Terry! Terry! Terry! Terry!

Won't you come? Come now. Step forward in the shame of your sins and dedicate your life to the goodness and the redeeming love of the lamb. Earnestly, tenderly, he is calling. And except that you accept his word, you are doomed to the agony and pain of eternal damnation. Won't you come? Won't you accept Jesus Christ? CROWD: (SINGING A HYMN) Softly and tenderly, Jesus is calling-- [big band music] CROWD: --for me. See, on the portals, he's waiting and watching. Watching for you and for me. Come home.

Well, I'm going to let you in on a secret. It wasn't me. (SINGING) Ain't got no use for no kind of small fry. I got my cards on the table. I'm willing and able. And my limit is the sky. [chuckling] It was a rival. They dubbed it in. They used another girl's voice, and they built my whole career on that song. Oh, it was all a lie. Except being young. And I-- I was young. The studio makeup department created this face. They capped my teeth, and they bobbed my nose. Mary Jane Perkins had a good nose. And they bobbed it. (SINGING) To make use of what nature bestows. My telephones. My telephones everywhere really did ring all the time. Ding a-ling-a-ling, a-ling-a-ling, a-ling-a-ling. Ooh! Hello? Yes, this is Treasure Evans.
