I've never been off the island, John. Neither has your imagination. Stop. Where would you travel? Boston. No, I mean, if you could go to South America or Europe? Boston. Really? What is it? I'm hungry. You've no more money. Ah. Are you looking for someone? I need a room. Just for a week or two. Do you have family on the island? I do not. I'll take you for a night. After that, you're on your own. There's rooms out by the five corners. Guinea town. Sh. Jake. What brings you here? The war. You tell him. Tell him what you need. His doctor stopped giving him medicine. Is your leg still hurting? Just give us opium, doctor. I beg you. I only wish to know the man's condition, good woman. Give him what he needs, or I won't stay with him. Not another night. This is the last of what I've got. I want to see him back here if he needs help. Way I hear it, you're about to pull up stakes anyways. Only to another part of town. Here. Good morning, Mrs. Rivers. What you doing holding a chicken? Rent. Although, my landlord apparently prefers pork. I'm getting evicted. Where will you go? You need your chemist. I gave away the last of that opium. You still owe me for it. Well, first I need to find a new office. What are you gonna do with that chicken? Make a good soup. I beg your pardon. Uh, Mrs. Roland? Yes? Don't make me guess. I'm looking for a Dr. Peter Roland. Ah. Why? Are you unwell? My husband was a captain in the war. They crossed paths. A captain? Well, Peter doesn't talk much about the war. Is he expecting you? No, but I have traveled a long way. Mm. Women delay the start of everything. Not very polite to our visitor. Oh. Apologies all around. Now can we simply get in the boat? Oh yes, I would like to introduce you. We'll make our introductions later. After we've tried to at least catch a single fish. Work here can be dreadfully dull for a woman. Unless you like dipping candles or cleaning fish. Quiet. All right, watch this. Christ. Charles. They don't bite at all. Only men should go fishing. Father, please. Without even a bite in two hours, why bother? The lazy brutes have taken their siestas in the sun. Well, you've had plenty of good sport. How many did he hook? Four. A silver heap of clammy scales and struggling fins breathing in the fatal air. John has a way with words. And, you are a doctor? Not really. You were not a doctor in the war? I was. Lucia says her husband was a captain. Also that he knew you. Only briefly. At Antietam. Your husband was in the Navy- I hope we're not gonna turn a family fishing trip into a reenactment of the Battle of Antietam. I am sorry, Mr. Roland, but perhaps- Peter was a brave union soldier. First lieutenant in the 20th Massachusetts infantry. That's all you need to know. He saved men's lives and brought glory to the good name of Nantucket. You have a husband? He was killed at Gettysburg. I insist we stop this. I missed the war. I slept through it. The place to be, I would say. My husband told me he was treated by a doctor from Nantucket who appeared to him as an angel. There were no angels at Antietam. I came to find you. I would like to know why. Now is not the time. I agree. You're interrupting. I haven't had the chance to- - The race is over, John. Will you walk with me? I should go back to town. I found a rooming house in Guinea. No. Have, have dinner with us. Peter? Tend to Mother, old boy. Let me see. Josephine'll have dinner ready. We'll join you at the house. There may be more to this young woman than we care to know. It pains me to ask, but I need to borrow $5. John helped himself to the last of my cash and I need to be solvent for the move. Of course, but don't be so hard on your brother. We need to help him to find his way in the world. Which will never happen if this goes on. The girl is stunning. Though her pretext for her arrival at our doorstep just takes my breath away. I wouldn't judge her for that, not yet. Is there something you're not telling me? You have your eye on her. We don't keep secrets. Oh, it's only you. Only? I pay your keep young lady. No, I mean, there was a fella here earlier, seemed in a hurry to see you. Well, tell me, who was he? A gentlemen. Called twice while you were away fishing. And what did the gentleman say? He was from the notary. He said attorney Bennett would be here himself this evening. What can it be? An attorney means bad news. We still owe for storm damage. Or money. But there isn't a single person on this island that will give or leave us a nickel. Not that we haven't tried to cultivate one. Do you remember your Uncle Joseph Le bow's second wife? Yes, a Donovan girl. Daughter of a paper hanger. They had money, and they liked us. Yeah. And he was in poor health. Have they any children? Oh, I should say so. Four or five. In my opinion, this important business has to do with a marriage proposal for John. Why me? You're the elder. Besides, I do not wish to marry yet. Oh, so you are then a ladies' man? Isn't necessary to be a ladies' man to say that one does not wish to marry yet. Ah good. That explains it. "Yet," you're waiting. Fine. I'm waiting then, if you'll have it so. What fools we are to bother about this. Attorney Bennett is a friend. He knows that Peter's looking for a suitable new office and he's found one. Meal will now be served. I hope we have finished discussing family matters. Ms. Childs, tell us all about you. My story is of little interest, Mrs. Roland. Won't you tell us from where you come? I'm all ears. Cuba, originally. My family fled when I was just six, to St. Augustine. Why on earth? My father was hunted in Cuba for his work against slavery. He opposed the Spanish rulers of my country. If you were against slavery, then why the hell did your family settle in a slave state? Charles, please. No child bears the burden of what their parents do. My family wished to stay out of the war. Many people did. Oh, I'm sure. What about your husband? You said he knew Peter. Did he fight for the Union? Stop it, Charles. And don't answer him, Miss Childs. It's all in good humor. Robert E. Lee brought 20,000 slaves with him to Gettysburg, young lady. And he grabbed and shackled every free Negro he encountered on his march through Maryland - and Pennsylvania- - Miss Childs said that her family opposed slavery, Father. Or, weren't you listening? Well I'm guessing that she married a Confederate officer who defended slave owners. Am I wrong? Yankees built and profited from the slave trade for 200 years, Father. Our family, including you young man, were abolitionists. This island established the first Quaker meeting in the world opposed to slavery. While some island Quakers held onto their slaves for another 50 years. And the Newport Quakers made their fortunes from slavery. Why did you fight in the war, son? I didn't fight. I tended to the dead and the dying. And yes, because I opposed slavery, as does Miss Childs, or Mrs. Childs, which is something we have in common. Now that everyone, except our John, has finally established their bona fides, could we forget this nonsense and enjoy our flounder? My father said- And that includes you, Miss Childs. Yes, of course. I do not know what is next for me. I need to settle a bit. I hope I will see you. I have only one request. What are you even saying? Just this time, Peter. She's what I dreamed of. This talk is absurd on the face of it. You act like she's available for the taking. Listen Peter- I heard you the first time. Believe me. I don't disbelieve you. Hup! Hup. Good afternoon, Josephine. Are the Roland's at home? Yes, counselor. Right this way. Good evening, sir. Do you know a certain, a Mr. Leon Marshall of Boston? Mm-hmm, we do indeed. He's a friend? Best of friends. Formerly a Quaker, same as we were. Now a devoted Bostonian who never leaves Beacon Hill. He made a good deal of money selling whale oil. Mm-hmm. Mm, I've not seen him in years. I must tell you, Mr. Marshall is dead. Oh dear. He wasn't any older than I am. Well, my notary in Boston has communicated with me this morning, the principle condition of Mr. Marshall's will by which he makes your son John his sole heir. How will the inheritance be executed? Charles, please. Oh, I'm sorry, uh, uh, how did poor Marshall die? Well, I only know he has no other heirs, and he has bequeathed his entire fortune to your second son, who he had known since birth and judged to be worthy of this legacy, which now produces an income of $17,000 annually. And should John refuse, the entire fortune reverts to a charity in Boston for abandoned children. Christ, what a generous man. I am very happy to have brought you this good news. Your good news is the death of my parents' friend? Forgive me, of course. He was very kind to my brother and me. He invited us to dine with him sometimes. I don't remember much, except he always hugged me when we met. You'll have to pardon me. Of course. Good evening, Mr. Bennett. Peter. And there are no possible challenges or difficulties to the will? No, none at all. It's all very clear. It just requires John's acceptance. Well, you lucky devil. Ain't you gonna kiss me? It hadn't struck me as indispensable to the transaction. Ah. At last, a stroke of fortune. Did you know Mr. Marshall well? Yes, we did. The day you were born, it was Leon who went for the doctor. We were breakfasting with him when your mother took sick. In his haste, he grabbed my hat instead of his. We had a good laugh afterwards. It's likely he remembered helping bring you into the world. Come in. Uh, it is best we talk in private. Indeed. Please, sit. First, I would uh, I would like you to tell me on what errand you've come here and uh, and why now? I thought I had the privilege of asking the first question. Excuse my bluntness. A Confederate widow needs to be very discrete here. You fear my presence here is a danger to your reputation? Simply stated, yes. 73 men from Nantucket died in the war. Please, do not doubt my discretion. I see this is not a good time. No, I, I came here to talk. Your words to your family at the dinner table reveal you to be the kind of man I expected you to be. Did the attorney bring you good news? Did he find you an office? No, he came with the offer of money, to my brother, John. A family friend left him a substantial inheritance. Not to the both of you? No, though it seems odd. An old bachelor with no heirs leaves his fortune equally to both brothers. That would be simple and natural. Oh, I am sorry. I do not mean to intrude in your family matters. And I am equally surprised that I'm telling you this. I hardly know you. Nor I you. Though, your brother's inheritance does have a certain logic. What do you mean? He is so unlike you. Even, uh- Even what? Nothing. Let us just say that he has better luck than you or me. I can't think. I uh, I don't belong here right now. Oh. Excuse me, but I don't feel comfortable saying any more, except that I trust that you will keep my confidence. I should say the same thing to you. You have not revealed anything. Surely, we will talk again soon. Forgive me, Miss Childs. No, there is nothing to forgive, on the contrary. Please. May I join you? Of course. I love it here. When I was in the war, I used to get through it by imagining I was other places. I would think about the times I came down here, seized by the desire to be on the boats to countries with roaming lions and exotic hummingbirds and stunning girls. You won't have to work now. You can travel wherever you choose, and find a fair-haired Swede, or a Southern beauty. Though I think you would rather land the widow, Lucia. Though she's clearly here for you. You are delusional. Now also rich. Yes, dear boy, you are a rich man. I'm very glad to have come upon you, to tell you how pleased I am for you. How, truly I congratulate you, and how much I care for you. Thank you, my good Peter. Now I'll leave you to dream about the future. It's me. What's the matter? I just wanted to say good morning. You're up so early. I've got patients. Just a minute. Come in. Will you be home for dinner? I don't know. I have my sights set on a new office with a place to live. The widow's found a boarding house? She has, the Atlantic House. In New Guinea. Miss Childs says she wants time alone. It's really nothing, Peter. It's just, I'll only offer her as much help as she needs. By the way, mother, I remember when I was a boy I think I saw a little portrait of Leon Marshall. Yes, it could be. Do you know what became of it? Uh, let me think. I'm not absolutely sure. You know, maybe it's in my desk. You look striking. Do you think you might find it for me? I'll look. I'll look. Why did you want it? I thought it'd be only natural to give it to John, so he can have a picture of his benefactor. I will search for it, after breakfast. Well, I immediately thought of this place, seems quite fitting for a young doctor. Yes. Yes. It's very nice. I've had my eye on it for some time. It's perfect. Well uh, two doors open onto two different streets. There are two drawing rooms, a glass corridor where your patients can wait, and a garden out back. I can't imagine a better place. I'm sure you'd have many callers. Yes, I am expanding my practice. How much might it cost? 1,500 for the year. It's a three-year lease. What are the terms? Half down, and the balance in four months. Do I have time to think about it? Well, you seem to like it. I want it, I just need three or four days to assemble the deposit. Well, I'll see what I can do, Doctor. Do you mind if I just make some sketches? Oh, be my guest. Just drop this by my office when you're done. Thank you. Where's the new office? 32 Water Street. I'll make plenty. How much will the chemist make? More. I'm sold. And each morning, I'll look out at the harbor, I'll take a swim, I'll go downstairs. I'll see 10 patients a day at $5 each, that's 12,000 a year. And in the afternoons I can see old friends, war veterans, maybe, maybe I'll just take $2 from them. Special. I'll be richer than my brother, Smoke, and more eminent, knowing I've made it on my own. I'm looking for Miss Childs. The widow? And now with her and your brother- Is that where she is, with my brother? You could use a girl, in your office. I can work for you, mind my own business. I don't earn enough to pay myself. I'd get them to pay. I would like you to give this to your new boarder. It's just to let her know where I am in case she needs help. Good day, Miss Ross. Not if it hurts my brother. The simple thing would be to refuse the money. Why? Believe me, you will find it useful. Yes, how many times do you say to yourself, "Damn, if I only had some money." Wouldn't you agree, no woman wants to marry a man? Marry? I would rather be a mole than a wife. You're not marrying again? You came here to Nantucket with no thoughts of marriage? You plan to live as a widow, a single woman. John, I simply came out for a walk. I just meant it, it won't be easy. I didn't mean to suggest- We both know what is going on. You hid in the bushes all morning, waiting for me to come out of the boarding house. I don't mean to be forward. Your eyes are shrinking. Lucia. Lucia. I would set myself up in a handsome home that makes people open their eyes. You also ought to ride on horseback. People will notice. Select one or two good cases to defend. Make your mark in court. And you do not want to give up the benefit of your studies. A man ought never to sit idle. Fiddlesticks. You don't agree, Charles? I just want him to get his own apartment. Now he can. But we're not beasts of burden. The smartest thing in life is to take it easy. There, you and I disagree, Father. He'd be a fool to work himself into the ground. 11 grueling years on a whaling vessel taught me that and nothing else. It's not John's wealth that gives him worth. In the hands of some men, wealth can be a powerful lever. Those men are few though. Oh. If John wants to be a truly superior man, he needs to show it by what he does. Tra-la-la. Pardon, Father? When you have a large income you would be stupid to work. Again, we differ, Father. I have a request for John though. Surely, what is it? I need a loan, or at least the money back that you've borrowed. I need it soon. We have a full afternoon planned for your brother. Won't you join us? Let him do as he wishes. Surely you weren't expecting me. Peter. Peter. You're awfully frosty this morning. Father is wrong. The smartest thing in life is not to take it easy. The smartest thing in life is to avoid dangerous emotions. How? I have complete faith in you. Come home in time for dinner. Help us plan a celebration for your brother. I've got a patient who's asked for an overnight call. What is it, Peter? You'll get your new patients, your new office. I don't have to worry about you like I do John. He doesn't have your drive. What is to become of me, Mother? Miss Childs. I got your note. I'm a bit late. My comment about you and John was uncalled for. I hadn't thought of it. But uh, now, I think you're right. We do look different. My brother should refuse the money. You have never wanted money? Of course. In fact, I need it now to secure a place before I lose my practice entirely. So you understand John's dilemma. I just think there's more to it. My brother would do better to give it away. Dr. Roland. What is it? Do you mind, sir? We're looking for you. Well, my hours commence at one. What's the problem? A girl, she's been hurt. Where? Just up the street. What happened? A carriage ran right over her. We need to leave her here. Her artery's ruptured. What do I do? My surgical tools are in a glass case. There's a bone saw. The chloroform is marked. Okay. Lucia? Come in. Thank you. Luck that you are here. I can ask for tea. No, thank you. I am concerned about Peter. Why? What happened? Oh, why am I telling you? I, I assumed that you might know something. Things get inside him and they stay there. Can I help? I care deeply. Please. He suspects that I have turned against him. It probably seems strange why I came here to find him. I'm sure he needs someone to make him happy. That is not my intention. Well what are your intentions? I am not sure. And what about my poor John? He has his faults, but the look in his eyes when he sees you. Yes. May I? Yes. Photographs of your family? Friends. Women who lost their lovers in the war. Like I have. It sounds awful, Peter. The girl probably didn't have a chance. Still, if I had gotten there sooner. You can't assume that. God, I need a drink. So where were we? You need a loan. I'm ready to start a new practice, John, but I need money. Of course. I'll help. Thank you. I don't have an exact figure for what you borrowed, but uh, now that you- What's the money for? A new office. A grand place that can get my business going again. I need $750. I'll pay what I can. But I can't immediately, I've already paid the deposit on a new place on Water Street. You've what? Where? 32 Water Street. 32 Water Street? It's a splendid place, Peter. Two drawing rooms, a grand glass corridor, and a fine garden. It's a little elegant for my taste, but, well you never know. Can you afford this? You know you owe me money. I'll pay you back what I borrowed but it's not more than 300. It's more than 300. I just can't pay it all now. Settle down, brother. Settle down? You know that I have been looking for a place. You were right Peter. I need to set myself up. Become a superior man. Mother's two sons, both superior men. You bastard. Hm. This little discussion, making me hungry. Goodness man, we've not yet found your cure. You won't. The cottage is available for $12 a month for six months. Will I like it? Until it gets cold, I think you'll find the island just fine. You remain a mystery to me, Miss Childs. You presume that I tended your husband on the battlefield, but nothing you say convinces, and nothing explains why you've made this long journey. I killed a Union soldier, Peter. I had to. Please. And I conducted espionage for the Confederacy. I came here to find comfort. I had nowhere else to go. For reasons I can't fathom, you have come here to expose me and to ruin what prospects I have. No. What consideration do I owe you that I did not already unduly show your husband at Antietam? Peter. I feel that I am accumulating debts for a payment that I never promised to make. When I was a girl, Peter, Union soldiers invaded my family's home. There were only three of them, but that was enough. They beat my father and they took him away, accusing him of financing the rebels. He was a Cuban expatriate and a farmer. He had nothing to do with the war. They wasted no time with us. First night, they took my sisters upstairs and had their way with them. And they were only a landing away. And I could still hear them. My sisters were strong, and they fought and they cursed these men. I hid in the stables. And when the third soldier came for me, I killed him with my father's pistol. I road on horseback and I found a rebel outpost, and I offered to find Yankee troops and report their location. I bartered for my survival. As for my husband, he was my contact. A captain I informed of what I saw. And he was killed? Yes. In Pickett's Charge. I saw it, and I heard the sounds. I am cold. When the war began, there were few doctors on either side, and thousands killed and wounded, sometimes in a single day. I enlisted, after going down to the dock to see the first steamboat coming back from the battlefront carrying island soldiers. Everyone turned out. It was a holiday. Until we saw the steamer coming into port, its flag at half-mast. And there were six young island men on board in caskets. I went to the front to serve the Union cause. Almost immediately I wanted out. I tended to Southern soldiers, yes, and more than once. I suppose I saw a dying soldier as no longer the enemy. Armed and upright? Yes. But, crying out at night in a field with thousands of dying men, no. You did see my husband, Wilbert Childs? I tended three rebel fighters at Antietam, and one was a captain in Lee's Virginia Army. I found him huddled in stark terror in a culvert, buried under a dozen dead soldiers. Hours after the battle, I heard him crying out for mercy and I went to him, not knowing if the voice was from the North or South. You amputated his left arm. I thought he would live. To fight another day at Gettysburg? Well, he promised me he wouldn't fight again. That was my condition. Even if I didn't always believe him. My family doesn't know this about me. No one on this island does. I became a medic because I refused to fight. But I am a patriotic veteran of the Union army. I held a dozen island boys in my arms and watched them die. And I saved many more. I don't sleep much. I'm certain my sisters' attackers have not forgotten me. I have not forgotten them. Is that why you're here? You're running, is that it? The ceasefire did nothing for the South. Teachers killed. A Negro man refuses to tip his hat, and he is shot dead in the street. Why would I stay? I could not go back to Cuba. And your kindness to my husband drew me here. Where's Peter? He's always late. I say we begin without him. Look at this man. A whaler retired long ago, with neither thighs, chest, arms, nor neck. I, on the contrary, am as tight as an egg, and as hard as a cannonball. Oh. May I? You may. Ah! To all of us. Lift your glasses. To the man with a bank draft in his new account. 17,000 per annum, free and clear. Dinner is served. No, no, no, no. Tonight everything is for John. Ah, well. It's all right. And then I just , I saw, I was 10, and there was Christ right there, standing on the clothes. And then I saw the oddest looking fish. With its gold goggles and, and fat, red belly. And its fan-shaped fins, and its, at the bottom, a tail. It was crescent-shaped, the tail. And there it was, and it was starting to go away. Away, oh, ah-oh, there it is now. What the devil? I should have eaten at the Sea Shack. Peter, we kept the soup warm. Last time I ate at the Sea Shack I was sick for two weeks. I like that sound better than a pistol shot. It may be more dangerous for you. How so, lieutenant? Because the bullet might miss, but the wine is dead certain to hit you straight in the stomach. And then what? Then it scorches your intestines, shocks your nervous system, and makes your circulation sluggish, which can lead to an apoplectic fit, which threatens the end for a man of your build and temperament. Ah, these damn doctors, they all sing the same tune. Eat nothing, drink nothing. Cut the gamahuching. Keep your bawbles in your pocket. Well sir, I have practiced all of these forbidden pleasures and more, wherever and whenever I pleased. That's when I did it. Here, here. And I'm none the worse for it. All bon vivants talk as you do, until the day when they can no longer crawl back to tell the prudent doctor, "You were right." Peter, think what a wonderful occasion this is for John, and for all of us. You're mean to, to spoil it. You really think this will kill me? I'm sure of it, but drink it this once. Not too much. Ah. I propose a toast to celebrate the ascension of John, the rich. Here, here. Peter. My only desire is to fly away from these people, to leave their idle talk and silly jests. And their joy. You are jealous, that is all. I'm not jealous. You are, it is shameful. Don't leave. You are in my good graces John, because the wine cheers my foul temper. And prevents me from saying what I would like to say to you. Which is what? I don't remember. Well, we are here tonight to honor our dear friend John. It is said that fortune is blind. I say she is simply shortsighted, and has lately acquired one hell of a good pair of glasses, so that she may see our remote little island and the son of our worthy comrade, and my friend, Charles, captain of the Little Pearl. Thank you captain. I and my son will not forget you, or this occasion. I drink to your wishes. Sit down. It's my turn. It is I who should thank my devoted friends, who today give me touching proof of their affection. But it is not with words that I will show my thanks. I shall prove it tomorrow, and always, through my actions. Well said, my boy. Miss Childs give us a toast from the fairer sex. Let us offer our thoughts to the fond memory of Mr. Marshall. It takes a woman to pay so delicate a tribute. Who the blazes was Marshall, anyway? You must've been quite intimate with him. The finest kind, like a brother. Such a friend we won't find twice. He dined with us, took us to the theater in Boston. Need we say more, Louise? Yes, Charles, a faithful friend. I've had enough. Evidently. Excuse me. Peter. Peter. Peter, come to your senses and calm down. Go back inside. I will not go back inside. Don't talk to me in that tone. Have you found your photograph of Leon Marshall? Where did you find that? Did you deceive my father? This honest and mediocre man. Oh, I'm sure you married, as young girls do, the man with a promise of a fortune from stripping oil. The boy was not cut out for years on end on the high seas chasing a vanishing, reluctant prey, was he? And what of this tender woman? Shut up for years in his absence and tied to him when he returns to drink and smoke cigars, and, and talk of money, boats, and fish. And then one day a man appears, as lovers do in novels, and he speaks as lovers speak. Of course, you found love in his arms. - Oh, Peter. - And of course, you allowed him to draw up a chair in another man's home. This, this, this man of means, growing rich from brokering whale oil pretending to be a family friend while making a fool of my father, myself, my brother, and yes, you. What? Did you give yourself to him? This man, who even now, faraway and grown old, leaves his fortune to your son, your son with him. Perhaps you should forget all of this about your brother and the money. Why pursuit it? Why? Because of the obvious hiding and cheating. Why didL eon Marshall not see this result of causing chaos in my family? Why did my father not feel it? And he is nearly giddy. Why does my mother pretend that this is something other than what it is? No, the way in which this unexpected fortune has arrived now, so fills my mind that there is little room for other thought. To whom should it matter? To the public, of course. To our neighbors. Why should anyone care, Peter? When they're speaking of the Roland sons, will they not ask, "Which is the truth and which is the false one?" Walk with me, please. All of our endeavors are like the laborers of these urchins. How I might like to beget two or three of these little creatures, watch them grow up, mindless of all that we endure. Perhaps I long for marriage, Miss Childs. Is this a new feeling? You know, I know very little of women. A man is not so lost when he is not alone. Just to feel someone stirring beside me in hours of doubt on uncertainty, to feel the presence of a woman. A woman's kiss, the touch of her hand, the rustle of her petticoat. The soft look in her eyes. To calm my needful heart. I do not want to kiss you. You know that I am fond of you. You prefer John. Your mother says not to expect you for the picnic. Lucia'll be here shortly. Are you going? Maybe not. You look cross. No. Should I be? I'm happy you're home, but you shouldn't fight with your brother. We've been lucky enough to receive this inheritance. Yet, it's as if we're in mourning. I am in a way. You are? Who for? A woman. No one you knew. Well, I won't pry. Though it's obvious. I hope you recover. Do you understand what I'm talking about? Do you? Think what you're doing. I've heard enough. Louise. You look terrible, for god's sake. Can't you see that your mother's not well? Will you do something? I'm just tired. Let me see. It's nothing, really. I'm going to find some vinegar. I'm not afraid of you. Come on then. Your pulse is quite fast. You should take something to calm you down. I have pills in my bag upstairs. What is it, Louise? I've never seen her like this. She'll be fine, it's just nerves. The fresh air will do her good. You'll come on the picnic with us, just in case? I'll go upstairs and get the pills. Low tide is three o'clock. Your mother and I are gonna go look for clams. Watch that Lucia doesn't get dizzy in the cold water. She'll be fine, Father. You look so severe. Look closer. In a trance? I oughta make up my mind. Fun is good but, love is better. I'll leave that up to you. I'll meet you later. You're exhausted, Louise. And you're still too involved with the boys. I'm not allowed? Well, I know I can't stop you. Well then don't. Encourage me. Look me in the eye. Do you think Miss Childs is serious about our John, or just playing with him? I can feel yo fighting all this. Though I confess, I don't know what's to become of us with Peter and John gone. Here, take this. I'm going. What is it? What do you see? I'm taking lessons. I'm learning how a man prepares himself for being a cuckold. Who are you talking about? John. He's laughable. You're so damn rigid. I know you're hurt, Peter. But why hurt others? Your brother couldn't hope for more. I'm sure she's perfectly honorable. Of course, all women are honorable, and all men are cuckolds. What do you see? I see your face. How pretty you look. If that is all you see, you will miss all of this. It's what I prefer to look at. John, you are staring. You're cruel. You're stunning. Stop. I'm thinking of only one thing. You. Will you be quiet? I love you. I can no longer hold my peace. You intoxicate me. My dear friend, you are no longer a child, and I am not a young girl. If you have made up your mind to declare your love for me, I assume you wish to make me your wife. Why yes, I do. I managed to snag an eel. Oh! Father will be nearly vindicated. He will not. Oh. Guess what I've done, Mother. I don't know. Guess. I've told Lucia I want to marry her. Marry her? Yes. Don't you think it's the right thing? Yes, she's charming. Of course. So you approve then? Yes, I, I approve. Is she with child? Do you mean to say that you're not pleased? No, but I am. I am pleased. Lucia's not with child, she barely lets me touch her. As it should be. What does she say about this? I cannot do better, I'm sure. You haven't answered my question. She didn't reply. That means that she's thinking about it. Oh , is that what it means? Come, talk to Lucia. She likes you. Maybe you can encourage her. I'm sure she gets all the encouragement she can manage from you. Miss Childs. I think I'll see if Peter and Father have wandered off. Do you intend to marry my son? I like John. I enjoy him, and I admire his good fortune, and his desire to share it. He says he loves me, and he wants to marry me. So I will marry him. Girls are raised to marry. They're not always made to understand the compromise until later. Of course we are. We sell to the right bidder and pray for love to follow. You were married. Betray yourself and you will find yourself betraying others. I understand. Good. What do you think? Gorgeous. This is where we'll live. Christ almighty. Truly grand, son. Counselor. If humanity alone, if our instinct of natural compassion we feel towards all who suffer, were the motive for the acquittal we ask, then I shall appeal to your compassion, gentlemen of the jury. To your hearts as fathers and as men. But, we have the law on our side, and it is simply a question of justice we shall submit for your judgment. Bravo. What about women at the jury? How well my voice carries in this room. Would you like a little tour? Excuse me. What do you think? Does it please you? Yes, it does. The bed is so white. Did you choose this? I did. Welcome to the family, Lucia. I'll leave you. Fit for a king, I'd say. This has all been such a delight. I will take my leave now. Charles. Charles. Would you accompany Miss Childs to her boarding house? Ah, yes dear. Shall I come back for you? No, no. Peter will see me home. - Mother? - Mm-hmm? Would you excuse us? Oh, of course. The widow certainly looks all-in. The widow? What has happened to you? You've made quite an impression. I'm really getting tired of your attitude towards me. Towards you? How dare you. I know that you're jealous of me. Oh, jealous, good lord, jealous of what? Of your looks, of your brains? Your apartment? It drives you mad that Lucia prefers me to you. Oh really? Jealous of you and that shrewd little goose? You're bursting with jealousy. Shut up. No, and you torture Mother as if it's her fault, as if everything is. Shut up, right now. No. I've wanted to tell you what I think. I demand a little respect. Me, respect you? Yes, me! Respect you? You who's dishonored us all with your greed. What did you say? Greed? Go on, dammit. Tell me how I've dishonored us with my greed. I'm saying you don't accept one man's fortune when you're supposed to be the son of another. What'd you say? Say that again. I'm just saying what everyone else is whispering. Are you stupid? You're the bastard son of the man who left you the money. Here's your father, Leon Marshall. No man with any respect would accept the money. Not when it dishonors their mother. Peter, please. Please, let's discuss this. Peter help me. I am a swine to have told you this. Sit down. What Peter said is true. Why lie about it? You wouldn't believe me if I denied it. Hush. I have nothing more to say. What are you doing? Where are you going? I don't know. Mother. Well, what, what? John, John. You will not go. I love you. Oh it's impossible. Tomorrow, even you will not forgive me. How can I live between the two of you? Of course you can. How can I avoid thinking of this when I see you and your brother every day? It does not matter. But you would think of it. My child, we must try to be calm. If I were to hear, even once, what I heard from your brother, if I was to see in your eyes what I read in his, - I will be gone. - Stop. You don't have to forgive me. There's nothing so wounding as forgiveness. But you must owe me no ill will for what I have done. You must be strong enough to accept that you are not Charles' son, without blushing and without despising me. You must say to yourself that although I was your father's mistress, I was more truly his wife. Before God, I love no one but him and you two boys. Stay, Mother. I can be with you. At least for tonight. That is out of the question. Come, I will take you home. I won't share it with anyone. I don't know what's happening to me. There was this kid in torn clothes, trying to walk, but he'd fall down. And he'd get back up, like this island boy at Cold Harbor, where artillery shot cut him in half. You'd had this before? Never like this. My heart beats like it's going to pound through my chest. What about your wife? Have you told her? She left. May I come in? Do you think me a wretch? What's the matter with your eye? What did you and mother say to each other after I left? Nothing. Mama and I sorted linens. I somehow doubt that's all- Peter. Since I am the son of this other man, since I know it and accept it, is only natural I should accept his fortune. Since I'm not the son of the man I believed to be my father, I can accept nothing from him. Neither now, nor after he dies. It would not be right. I shall renounce all claims to the family inheritance, and leave it to you. It is only right. It is also just that I keep the money from my own father. If I were to refuse my father's money, it would only invite hardship, which would serve no one. I understand, John. Good, which brings me to the next matter. What is that? It's a delicate point. It involves your presence here. And in the family. Is that what you're suggesting? Not at all. That now that I am the sole heir, I should leave the Roland family? You should leave the island, Peter. Your presence hangs like a cloud over everyone, most of all, you. There's a schooner, a freight schooner, leaving for Boston, and then Baltimore. I know the captain, and I'm prepared to provide you with the funds you'll need for six months in either city as you work to set yourself up. John. No. Good morning. Good morning. Are you not coming down to eat? There is a great deal for me to do, because I see now that you were right. Yes? It is time for me to leave this house. It no longer feels like a home. And these people who no longer feel like my family, we are bound by the thinnest of threads. I torture you and Mother with my mere presence. And clearly, I torture myself. It is unbearable. We'll wait for you. Is she, is Mother down there? Yes. She sent me to fetch you. Very well, I will come down. It's a handsome schooner that's come into port. It's the Tyrone. Life is very pleasant on these ships. Hm. I am planning to sail with her. What on earth do you mean? I spoke to the purser and I will sail with her on Thursday. I have my heart set on it. Is this true? Louise? All the arrangements have been made. Well, huh, then perhaps you can take me on board. I've been wanting to see the insides of that boat. Certainly I will. Have you got money, Peter? I have sold my watch. I'm happy to give you- I'll be fine. Are you sure that you have enough? What of all your plans? What's to become of them? I'll work on board. I'll make new plans. Hm, what do you think Louise? I think that Peter is right. Why, I'm happy you agree. I know John does too. Father? In a couple of years you'll have a practice and some money, and you'll be on your way. Will you promise to write, Peter? No, thank you, Josephine. I'm too nervous this morning. Hm, well. Excuse me, everyone. So, Mama, will you come with me to calm Lucia? Yes. Yes, I will come. I think I'll gather some flowers from the greenhouse. You see, Peter was quite ready and willing to go away. Poor boy. Why do you say, "Poor boy?" He will be happy onboard the schooner. No, I know. I have things to take care of upstairs. Well, you'll be needing some things. But I'm at a bit of a loss. I ordered your underwear, and I went to the tailor for the rest of your clothes. But, do you need anything else? No. Nothing else. Maybe things that I haven't thought of? No, thank you. It's all done. Hello? I hope we're not too late. We want to spend some time with you. Step inside. You don't get much air down here. Well, you even have your own pharmacy. Maybe I'll be called upon to help someone. Yeah. Ah, sooner than I thought. Well, we best be going. But must we? Already? Sounds like she's about to sail. Well, goodbye son. Heh. Let's go. I thought Lucia might come. You look disappointed. Will you say goodbye for me? Have you made plans? We know what we'd like. We'll have a lot to talk about.
