Directed by Takashi Miike A Human Murder Weapon: Ring of Love and Anger PUB LOUNGE Stardust Welcome. How is it? Is it on? Two people are coming in. Detective! Eating without paying is illegal. Double Bourbon, 18,000 yen. I heard my boss lost about 5 million downstairs last week. Tax money can't be wasted like that. What I drank is nothing compared to that. Just let me have it. Your usual seat is ready. Paying in advance? Thank you for waiting, everyone. For the 3rd match of the night... the invincible Karate Kid is entering the ring! Don't lose! His opponent's name is Mark Titan. The former world champion of FOWA is joining our league for the first time! This is bad. Will the 20 million I bet on Karate Kid disappear from your account? Kill or be killed. I survived another fight today. 1. 2. One Year Ago 3. One Year Ago Again! 1. 2. 3. Again! 1. 2. 3. Again! 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... Hey! 9. Back! I am Yoshito Mikage from the Kushin School in Tokyo I heard a lot about you, Master Gensai Asahina. That's why I'm here to have a fight. Please wait! My father doesn't fight outsiders. Are you his daughter? You are my type. You are thick. You just tore off the button of my coat, didn't you? Sorry. You just saw my successor's fantastic skills. It's time for you to leave. What is it? Why did you bring me here this late at night? Since I can't have an official fight... I want to have a private fight with you. You just don't get it, do you? Come at me. If you don't, I have no choice but to bring your father here. He won't accept your challenge. If he doesn't, I will tell everyone that he ran away. Got it. Great! That's not fair! It took me two hours to dig this hole. I didn't really want to do this... but I underestimated you because you are a woman. Your skills are even better than other men's. Actually, I can't afford getting injured before an important event. I'm safe in this hole. What important event? Even if Gensai said that he wouldn't accept my challenge... why did you come here in the first place? It's true that I fell in love with you at first sight... but you were also excited to com see me here, weren't you? That's ridiculous! Anyway, let's forget about our current situation... and have fun here on this beach under the moon. The mood is perfect for it. Who would do such a thing with you? Tell me the truth. I saw a mole on his flank. He is saying it shows he has slept with you. Is it true? Did you see it? It is true, but... Stop talking! Just stay there! Don't have a grudge against Mikage... and kill yourself because you lost against him. Just tell yourself that you despair... because you lost self-control and are also incompetent. Last Will Tokyo Finally, I found you. Are you here to avenge your father's death? I have to live with you. I ran away from Okinawa. You have to live with me? What do you mean? My baby? Yoshito Mikage Do you know what kind of man I am? I might regret this one day, but I fell in love with you. How about you? You went back here alone without telling me... because you regretted having slept with the master's daughter. Am I right? But I don't care anymore. In return, please promise me one thing. Don't ever again disappear without telling me. I don't like promises. Pinky promise. Yoshito and Kaoru Mikage I'm back. Naha Airport Glad to have you here, boss. Is everyone doing well? Yes. Japan Karate Martial Arts Kushin School -Okinawa Branch Apologies for making you come all the way here. When did Mikage disappear exactly? It was about two months ago Do you have any idea about his whereabouts? I'm not sure. Mikage was dating the singer of a night club in Matsuya... and I heard a member of the Okinawan mafia say... that Chin was taking care of the singer. He might be in trouble because of that. Chin... I heard about that guy. Who is that guy? You will see. You are strong. Your popularity is increasing too That's great. The audience is very happy. If I bet on you, I never lose. But the audience is also selfish. They get bored easily. If the chance ever decreases, they get bored even more easily. This is an unpleasant business. You understand? Some of you already know... Matilda, the popular foreign club singer of Japanese ancestry... with the nickname "Okinawan Leopardess". This is her debut match! Her opponent is Jane Tank! You can do it! Don't be too intimidated! Matilda! Don't die! You are definitely strong in the ring... but my power extends beyond that. Eat! This is like an execution. This is an evil idea. An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. Good evening. I guess you are interested in me. Is it true? I can tell by the look on your face that you can't help it. Chin, the boss of the underground pro-wrestling organization... is my boyfriend. Chin said your karate skills are superb. He told me that if he promoted you as the Karate Kid... in the underground pro-wrestling league... you'd definitely be a star there. So, are you seducing me... into working for the underground pro-wresting league? Are these the tricks of a headhunter? I gave up. It's not about that. I guess I'm actually attracted to you. That was great. I've never felt like this before. My body and mind become murder weapons. This is why I don't trust girls. Sir Chin is sad. Get dressed. The price of betrayal is very high. You should get ready to pay. Is this what's called the "Asshole Technique"? Well, you know your stuff. I got it. I will accept your challenge. But I can't have a fight with you right now. Are you afraid? Come on. Let's fight right here, right now. I'm a pro The one I'll fight tonight isn't you. If I survive tonight's match... let's have a fight some day. That's a promise! Don't forget! If we are still alive by then... I will win! I can't die here. Even after this, I should live on to keep fighting. Oh! That's awesome! It's called the "Anus Hole Hold." Oh, look! Matilda's mouth! Did you enjoy it? Oh, yeah... Let me end today's match. It's too early for her to die. A generous offer from Sir Chin. She got badly hurt, but at least she won't get punished. Matilda! Hey, are you okay? I'm not dead, am I? I was impressed when you bit off her ear. I will try harder as well, until I can escape from this lowest circle of hell. You don't understand anything. I bit off her ear... because I wanted her to kill me in anger. I wanted to finally get some rest. You mean you wanted to kill yourself... You and I had sex for the first time on this beach. When I heard that Mr. Omoto... dispatched you as an instructor to the Okinawa branch... I forgave you for breaking the promise... of not disappearing again without telling me. You knew I didn't want to return to Okinawa. So I didn't follow you immediately... and lived alone with the newborn baby in Tokyo for a while... praying you were okay. However, when I heard that you disappeared from that branch too... I started doubting your love. I wanted to find out in person if you were in Okinawa. If you were not, I wanted to know why you hadn't contacted me. I returned to my hometown, a place I had not thought of for a long time... to find out if you still loved me and to show this baby to you. If I survive the match, let's have a fight one day. That promise! Don't forget! I will win! Just wait! Wait! Just wait! Japan Karate Martial Arts Kushin School -Okinawa Branch - Saba! - Yes! I lost! Give your kick a steeper angle. If you do that, you don't expose your lower body. Yes! As the leader of the Kushin School, which aims to dominate Japan... I had a lot of disagreements with your father. I never expected his daughter would ever come to me. You must have a good reason. Mr. Omoto I am embarrassed to say this, but I really have to find him. Because Yoshito is that baby's father? Cute. He is supposed to be an instructor here, but I don't think he is. Does that mean he moved to another branch again? He has already been expelled. Well, I haven't officially told him yet. Expelled? Where does he work then? I know everything. Where he is and what he does. Tell me! Please! Please! Borch International Co., Ltd My name is Kaoru Asahina. Sorry for bothering you. Please have a seat. Allow me to ask a question. According to Mr. Omoto, Yoshito Mikage has become... a popular player in an underground pro-wrestling league. Definitely. Please save him. I would do anything if you do that for me. Okay. There is only one condition. If you become the female champion of the underground pro-wrestling league... I will release him for you. My friend, Karate Master Omoto, must have the same opinion. Understood. I will do it. Alright. Today, we have a new lady joining a match for the first time. The opponent of the ferocious female fighter Coppola Schmitt... is Miss Kaoru, who is having her debut match tonight! Kaoru... The boss and President Borch told me to keep you from approaching her. Why is Kaoru here? Stand up! Stand up! What the hell are you doing? Karate Kid! Stand up! Stand up! Karate Kid! Karate Kid! Karate Kid! Are you finally awake? I stopped him several times from killing you. Only this once. There will be no second time. Matilda's strip was popular, but the audience already got bored. She died yesterday, while you were sleeping. She died? Matilda died? Yes. The fighter whose ear got bitten off the other day... killed her with a powerful technique. The beautiful singer nicknamed "Okinawan Leopardess"... died in a pool of shit and piss It was very hard for us to clean up after that. I think the Karate Girl will die next time. I heard she ventured into this hell to get you released. Did you know that, Mikage? Miss Kaoru has brought a baby into this underground world. What did you just say? When I watched her breastfeeding the baby in her private room... she suddenly covered her breasts. You're that baby's heartless father. Well, even if she does her best, she'll end up in a grave. You have heard about your next opponent, right? The strongest underground pro-wrestling champion... His name is Bigaro It'll be a chain death match where you are connected with a chain. The boss and President Borch said they'd consider releasing her and the baby... if you beat Bigaro Is that true? Tonight's main event! The first chain death match in a long time! Bigaro, the strongest underground pro-wresting champion! The opponent is the Karate Kid! You promised. Release Kaoru Asahina and her baby. Huh? I only said I'd consider it. What? We need Kaoru for a mixed gender tag match this weekend. A mixed gender tag match? We have to try new things to keep the audience excited. If Kaoru's team wins, we will release the three of you. I have already talked about it with Mr. Borch. The three of us? You wouldn't lie, right? Master Omoto from the Kushin School and I are longtime friends. We know very well what's good for Kaoru. And he let her join an underground wrestling league? Even if I'm lying right now, there's nothing you can do In other words, he hates me that much. Now, we are having the first mixed gender tag match in a long time. The rules are the same as for the female tag matches. In other words, the losing team will get naked and entertain the audience. And even if one partner gets KO'd, the match continues as a 2-to-1 match. On the blue team: Chang-Li! Miss Kaoru! On the red team: Crazy Barbell! Eva Moa! The time has come. Freedom or hell. I will watch the match of your life live. Kaoru! Let's have a fight one day. Sorry. I won't fight you. I will die here. I am disqualified as a human murder weapon! Kaoru! This kind of life is not for me. I don't have the cold-heartedness and selfishness to be... a human murder weapon anymore. Kaoru... We will die together. Omoto.. Master Omoto came here to save me. Am I dreaming? Am I? I have appreciated your support and thought you a genuine supporter of karate. I guess I was totally wrong. Let's kill them. It doesn't matter anymore. Yoshito Are you awake now? I'm okay. So... Go... Master! Why did you come to save me? Mikage! I know you missed Kaoru every day. I just couldn't let you die in this underground ring. Both of you... Put your hands up! Why don't you put up yours instead? What? Look behind you. Don't move. I can paralyze your lower body... by hitting a point on your back... using a Kushin School Karate technique. Tell your underlings to drop their magazines and put down their guns. Do what he says. I learned this while fighting the female fighter. Kaoru and Master Omoto saved me. I got my freedom back. I don't even remember how many fighters I fought in this ring. I am disqualified as a human murder weapon. I lost my life once. I will lead a peaceful life now. That's right. Starting now.
