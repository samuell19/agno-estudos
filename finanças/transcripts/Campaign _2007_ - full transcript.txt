Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Yamauchi Kazuhiko, from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Prime Minister Koizumi. I'm a member of LDP Kawasaki's "Team Reform." Together with you, I plan to carry out Koizumi's reforms here in Kawasaki city. Please continue to support the Koizumi / Yamauchi reform policy. Please excuse the bother, this is Yamauchi Kazuhiko from Koizumi's LDP. Welcome home after a hard day's work. Good evening. This is Yamauchi. Please give me your support. Good evening, this is Yamauchi. I'm here to reform this city. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is Yamauchi from Koizumi's LDP. Together with you, I plan to carry out Koizumi's reforms here in Kawasaki city. While Koizumi is reforming the central government, we need to reform our local government. However, there is still much opposition resistance. We must advance administrative and financial reform. We must change the flow of money from government to non-government, and from the national government to the local government. We must galvanize small government, cutting unnecessary costs. There's still much waste to remove. I plan to carry out Koizumi's reforms here in Kawasaki city. Good evening. This is Yamauchi. My plan is to reform the government. This is Yamauchi Kazuhiko! Good evening. This is Yamauchi. Good evening. This is Yamauchi. Good evening, everyone. Welcome home after a hard day's work. Good evening. This is Yamauchi. Give my regards to your mom and dad for me. Which grade are you in? - 4th. 4th? Study hard! Good evening, everyone. Welcome home after a hard day's work. This is Yamauchi, member of LDP Kawasaki's "Team Reform." Thanks to your support, the LDP had a big success in the last national election. And that success means a big success for all of you too. We can change politics through elections. My name is Yamauchi Kazuhiko, and I won't let off anyone who tries to stop reform. Please continue to support the Koizumi / Yamauchi reform policy. Campaign I'll carry this, and you grab that please. Mr. Takao, I'm done. Leave them there, please. - These are kind of wet. - It's OK. They'll dry. It's important to look at people's eyes. - And you're able to do that? Yes, if I catch their eyes, they are more responsive. I learned a lot. We better call Mr. Hozumi? Yes, and call everyone on the list he gave us. WE WILL WIN! Hello, Mr. Hozumi. This is Yamauchi Kazuhiko. OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT: 6 DAYS AND COUNTING CERTIFICATION OF ENDORSEMENT KOIZUMI JUNICHIRO, LDP PRESIDENT Thank you for joining my supporters' association. How am I doing? I'm not so used to making calls. You're doing great. You sound sincere. Is Mr. Yazumi president of a company? If he is, I need to call him "Mr. President." Yes, he is! I just remembered his scary face. This is a message for Mr. President Yazumi. I appreciate the endorsement you were so kind to give me... The doors are closing. Take the next train, please. Sorry, take the next train please. It's too full. We're going to push, OK? Step further inside, please! YAMAUCHI KAZUHIKO Look at this. Here it is. This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience... to have so many posters of myself on display. I'll do whatever you say, Mr. Prime Minister DON'T STOP REFORM DRY CLEANING / REAL ESTATE AGENCY Excuse me, do you live in the Miyamae district? No. My name is Yamauchi. I'm running for a vacant seat on the Kawasaki City Council. - Do you use this store often? - Yes, I live around the corner. - Did you find your apartment here? - No, I didn't, actually. - Then, maybe next time... - Yes, certainly. I'm what you'd call a "parachute" candidate. I had to quickly move from Tokyo to Kawasaki for the election... to establish residency. You need to protect us little stores so we can survive. Please support Yamauchi! And if you win, please fix the ditch outside. Yes, that really is... the first thing to do! The pipe here is too small, so it floods when it rains. My store gets flooded as well. The city tends to neglect these kind of things. They say "we have no budget." That's a poor excuse. You're right. They should allocate money for this... Mr. Yamauchi! You may have seen my posters, but I'm here in person. Wow. Which grade are you in? - 2nd. So, you've learned your times table? Not at school, but.. At a cram school? No, online. Keep it up. Grow up to be important adults like this man. Watch out for the car. I see your face all the time. That makes me blush, but I'll introduce myself anyway. I'm Yamauchi. I promise I'll work hard for the community. I live just above this liquor store. I'd like to support mothers like you raising kids. I don't have any children yet, but it's going to be important for me in the future. The number of children here is the 2nd greatest in Japan, you know. Yes, so many families from our generation are moving here. I'll try to make it easier for people to raise their kids here. Great! He's going to fight for you! Take a look at the map. Yes, got it. Good morning, "Sensei" Yamagiwa. YAMAGIWA DAISHIRO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Please, "Sensei." What are you doing? You're the one who needs to speak. Good morning Green Heights residents! This is Yamauchi Kazuhiko from the Liberal Democratic Party. I'm sorry to disturb you so early. My name is Yamauchi from Koizumi's LDP, and I plan to carry out Koizumi's reform policy here in Kawasaki city. Our party, the LDP, received numerous applicants for the candidacy. We chose Mr. Yamauchi because he's a passionate, successful businessman who's contributed to society. He's never been involved with politics before, so he may not be an expert on policy making. But what's most important is that he has a great passion toward changing society. I hope you'll get to know Mr. Yamauchi and what a good man he is. And now, I'll pass the microphone back to Mr. Yamauchi. Good morning. This is Yamauchi Kazuhiko. As Yamagiwa Representative mentioned, I don't have any experience in politics. But I can use my perspective as a regular citizen to change Kawasaki city. Again, so sorry for the disturbance, and thank you. Thank you for listening. You shouldn't waste time sticking this flag in the ground. He can just hold it. Right, we shouldn't waste time. And make speeches in as many places as possible. So, I've got to visit the Hair Stylist's Union now. Have you visited them before? No, not yet. You haven't? Let's go now then. I'll follow you. Follow me in the car. Here's the miso soup. Pork or scallion? You want scallion, right? - Pork for you? - Whatever. Thanks. Next time I want Yamada to run instead of this guy. Me? No way. He's an important figure around here, isn't he? Of course. We need somebody from this area to represent us. Forget about it. I'm too old. From now on, all I want to think of is enjoying my retirement, traveling abroad. That sounds fantastic. You wanna come along? No, thanks. I have a boyfriend. Sorry. - How are you? - I just got back from a field day. Yamauchi, you've got to go those things. I should've let you know. Mr. Shingo's in charge. Then you've absolutely got to go! It'll be over soon. Go now. Go! Quick! Lunch break's over! SHIRAYURI FIELD DAY Yamada told me to come. Mr. Shingo, Yamauchi's here. Oh, but I can't present you now. No problem, I just wanted to say hello. Please have a seat. Thank you very much. Please extend a welcome to our guest, Kawasaki City Councilman, Asano Fuminao. Children, stand up straight. Bow... stand up straight. My name is Asano, a Kawasaki City Councilman, and the president of the Parents' Association. We are working hard to communicate the needs of parents to both local and national governments. Our candidate for the upcoming mayoral election has promised a reduction of tuition for kindergartens. This is a vital issue since governmental support for childcare... is expected to drastically increase next year. Stand up straight! Bow... and stand up straight. "Sensei" Asano, thank you. Are you visiting a lot of kindergartens? - Do you visit every event like this? - I try, but there's just too many. Hello, how are you? Your president was kind enough to give me an endorsement. Would you mind if I used a megaphone in front? I'll be quick. This is the 3-piece set up, right? Uh-oh, where's the mic? This is Yamauchi Kazuhiko from Koizumi's LDP. Hello, everyone. This is Yamauchi Kazuhiko from Koizumi's LDP. I plan to... oops! Just leave it! It's dangerous here. This is Yamauchi, member of Koizumi's LDP. What was your first speech in public like? I was really nervous and shy... it almost seemed impossible. But now I'm really used to speaking in public. The most important thing is to repeat my name. I was told that people don't listen to details. They say I should repeat my name over and over again... make sure I look and sound nice. How much is the campaign costing you? I don't know yet. People are sending me invoices. It's expensive. - Are you paying for it? - Just me... nobody else does. It's rough. Do you get any donations? Zero. I don't get anything because I'm not elected yet. Actually, I get a little from some organizations, but it's next to nothing. Chances are, I'll probably win this race, but nobody wants to donate any substantial money at this point. Yes... Yes, sir... I guess he's worried.. that I'm not going to be able to make the payment. Yes. I'll ask Ms. Nagai to handle all the money from now on. I'll give her my seal and bank statement. If it looks like there's going to be any trouble, I'll immediately let you know, Mr. Yamagiwa. Right. I'm so sorry about the mess up. I understand why you're upset. I'll be sure to handle money issues more carefully until the election's over. Yes, I'm so sorry someone complained to you. Hello? Yes, I hear you. Thank you for everything. Bye. I'm just gonna... Hey guys, long time no see. So good to see my old school buddies. Let's shake hands. Like politicians. Thank you for your support. You sound hoarse. It's because every morning and then again at night, I've got to give these speeches. I'm a totally different person now. Yeah, with you all of a sudden wearing a suit, it's like, wow, you really are running for office. Yeah, I've never even owned a suit before. I was waiting at a stoplight, and I saw this poster saying "Yamauchi Kazuhiko." I thought it was just the same name, but then your face was on the poster! I just had to take a picture, so I pulled over and took some. Cheers. There are so many things that piss me off. People are chewing me out all the time for whatever reason. Who chews you out? Everybody. Your volunteers? My volunteers, my Sensei, everybody. They even complain about the way I bow. Who are these "Sensei?" Diet members, prefectural assemblymen, city councilmen, etc. It's this party hierarchy you always hear about, no? Exactly. It's like a military. I've never joined this kind of group before, so I don't know how to behave. My wife comes along when I visit people. Sometimes at the door, they ask us Are you from the Census Bureau? And I need to call myself "KANAI" (housewife). "TSUMA" (wife) isn't appropriate, they say. "KANAI" (housewife) doesn't sound so politically correct. It implies all women should stay at home. "TSUMA" (wife) just sounds better. There are many liberals in Kawasaki. And the Democrats are very strong. Right now, the LDP and Democrats are 18 to 18 in the Council. So, if I lose this race, the LDP will also lose its ruling party status. My dream was to become the prime minister of Japan. But there are many steps along the way... Well, you'll never know in the future. Yeah, but I'm already 40. My plan was to become famous first, and then run for office. Celebrities do well in elections these days, you know. I was dreaming about becoming a city councilman in Tokyo, and keep my business selling stamps and coins. However, Representative Yamagiwa... suggested that I run for Kawasaki City Council. He knew me because his brother is my old friend. He was on the candidate selection committee, so I had serious advantages over other applicants. Since the LDP didn't have good applicants within the party, they picked me from outside. It was enough for them that I graduated from Tokyo Univ. The problem is the LDP already has 3 city councilmen pulling from the Miyamae district constituency. The LDP ordered the whole constituency to support me this time since the election is for a vacant seat. But in 2 years, all 4 of us will be competing for the same votes, which puts me in an awkward position. It's quite difficult because they each have their own territories. And when they see me walking around their territories, they complain. When I moved here, they even instructed me to move into a specific area so that I won't invade their territories. So you don't overlap Exactly. I feel like the whole country is this incredibly small village. Is that bad? Well, if you don't have solid organizational support, you just won't win. I wonder if it is the same in other countries. Maybe they have something like tribal chiefs who control election results, especially in developing countries. I wish my situation was like Taizo. He got a seat in the Diet without doing anything. But are you ready to be in a big scandal like him? Sure. But he was stupid to admit that he didn't pay social security tax. But you are not paying it either, are you? Of course I've been paying. Don't create a scandal here too! It's just my image of you... Don't harm my image, please. We need to put a "BEEP" there. Like, "He's not paying BEEP!' Did you get it? Let's shake hands again. Your hands are stiff now. Too many hand shakes. Please say hello to your wives. OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT DAY Hello, my name is Shinada. I'm a "warbler." I'm Yamauchi's "housewife." Good morning! How are you? This is my group of "warblers." This is Mrs. Yamauchi. Did you take a day off from work today? I took a paid vacation starting today. I took my laptop home to check company e-mails. Please protect our "campaign cars"... so there will be no accidents during the election... PRAYER FOR CAMPAIGN CARS Mr. Mochida, campaign director. Mrs. Yamauchi, please place the sash on our candidate. I'm a reporter for the Kanagawa Times. I just bought your paper this morning. So how are you planning to appeal to the electorate? My platform is based on 3 promises... I have 3 promises. To reform government finance, improve childcare support, and reduce crimes... How exactly? As for childcare support, what was that word again... the problem in the kindergartens...? Waiting lists? Yes, waiting lists for public kindergartens need to be reduced. I don't know if it's possible, but I'll also try to get financial aid for families with 3 kids or more. LDP A "going to the battlefront" ceremony for Yamauchi Kazuhiko is about to begin. Good morning. I feel much better now, so I can scream today. "Sensei," please take a picture with us. Hold on. You applied for the candidacy? Yes, I'm really a novice. Well, I am too. OGIWARA KENJI MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF COUNCILORS GOLD MEDALIST IN OLYMPICS KAWAGUCHI YORIKO FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER OF JAPAN Let's do our best. Thank you for coming today. Face that way so the voters can see you. Don't turn your back to them. You need to be more conscious of your angles. The way you bow, and the timing... they are very important. Please make some room here. Ladies and gentlemen good morning. We are fortunate that our candidate Yamauchi can start his campaign on such a fine day. Thank you all for coming today. Here, we also have Ms. Kawaguchi Yoriko, our candidate for the House of Councilors. Please support her along with Yamauchi. Good morning to you all! My name is Yamauchi Kazuhiko. Thank you all for coming today. I am grateful that so many "Sensei" are here for me. My mission is to continue pushing the reforms that will secure Kawasaki's future. ...because he has no ties to anyone. Because I have no ties to anyone on the political scene... ...together with "Sensei" Kawaguchi, we can push through reforms vital to Kawasaki's future. Pledge your support for me, and I'll give you everything I've got! Good morning. Thank you very much. I'll work hard for you. I'm Yamauchi. Thank you! Hey, Yamauchi! When you shake hands, the most important thing is how you end it. Make sure at the end you look them in the eye. Yes, "Sensei," let me try again. Good morning. I will work hard for you. Take care of the locals, just like Yamagiwa does. Yes, the local community is my #1 priority. Let them know you're leaving! Now, we're off to canvass the city! Our candidate, Yamauchi Kazuhiko is here in the car with us. Yamauchi Kazuhiko! He's young. He's energetic. Hello Ma'am, please support Yamauchi. Yamauchi Kazuhiko is here in the car with us introducing himself around the city. Hello Sir! How are you? This is Yamauchi Kazuhiko! Hello Ma 'am, this is Yamauchi, the LDP's official candidate for City Council. Yamauchi will breathe fresh air into the politics of this city. This is Yamauchi. Hello, how are you? Hi, my name is Yamauchi, I'm going to improve your childcare system. Mrs. Yamauchi sits in front. This is your ?warbler? debut. - Do you have gloves for her? - No, we ran out. Maybe she can use mine. Speak clearly, and listen to these two ladies... they're pros. All you need to say is... "This is Yamauchi's housewife. Please vote for us.? I think I can handle that. And don't talk about policy. You'll dig your own grave. The point is to show that you stand by your husband. Thank you everyone for seeing us off! Yamauchi has risen to his feet to push through the reforms vital to Kawasaki's future. Would you like to speak? This is Yamauchi Kazuhiko's housewife speaking. Please support my husband... Oops, it turned off. Hello, this is Yamauchi Kazuhiko's housewife. Mrs. Yamauchi is here in the car with us. She's gripping the microphone, asking you to support her husband. Now, it's her turn. Go ahead. Hello. This is the housewife of Yamauchi Kazuhiko, the LDP's official candidate for City Council. We will work hard to push through government reforms. Please vote for husband, Yamauchi Kazuhiko. Bye-bye, good luck! Say hello to your parents. Good luck. Hello. This is the housewife of Yamauchi Kazuhiko. Please support my husband, Yamauchi Kazuhiko. Great! You sounded better than the candidate. Your voice was so clear. You were really great. I felt bad bothering people with my voice, especially in the residential areas. But I was encouraged by all the children. People only listen to you for 3 seconds. So it is crucial to include the candidate's name every 3 seconds. Basically, we don't use the word "TSUMA" (wife), do we Not really, no. We usually use ?KANAI" (housewife). We joke around by adding the honorific "O" on purpose so it sounds like "OKKANAI" (scary wife). Anyway, just ?wife? sounds strange. I see. I'll just eat some instant ramen What? Have something better than that... I'll take one of these "A Day's Worth of Vegetables? Here are my daily vegetables. Why do we need to wear gloves? To avoid sunburn? I don't know. Maybe because they stand out. We also look clean in those gloves. But we need to take them off when shaking hands. Did you shake it well? Lt doesn't matter. It all gets mixed together in my stomach anyway. But there's all this micro-pulp condensed at the bottom. Wow, you're right. You are so detail-oriented. OK, done with my daily vegetables. Step back a little. Maybe this way. Am I in the frame? Lower your hand. Maybe there. That's perfect. Smile! Hello everyone, this is Abe Takao, candidate for Mayor. ABE TAKAO This is our Mayoral candidate Abe Takao. We at the Liberal Democratic Party... Stand right here, Yamauchi. Actually, you'll stand out more this way. - What's his first name? - Kazuhiko. - Does he have kids? - Not yet. He's married, though. And now please let me introduce Ms. Hashimoto Seiko, Diet Member and Olympic Bronze Medalist. Soon there will be a bye-election here in the Miyamae district. I strongly support Yamairchi... Kazu... hiko because he's received the strong endorsement of our party, the LDP. Please elect Yamauchi for the Prefectural Assem... I mean, City Council. This is our City Council Chairman. Let's take a picture please. We still need to solve many issues here in Kawasaki such as sanitation, childcare... I'll work hard for you. Stand next to Mr. Ishida. Please give your support to Mr. Abe so we can push through the much-needed reforms here in Kawasaki. ...and along with Mr. Abe, please vote Mr Yamauchi for City Council. My name is Ishida Yasuhiro, Kawasaki City Councilman. - How was it today? - I'm tired. You're still too pumped-up to really get any sleep. But in a few days, you'll probably find yourself ready to collapse in the afternoons. This lady is one of the local post office directors. I've been meaning to visit you... Actually, I met you over at the kindergarten during the field day. Oh, that's right, I remember you. You know, I'm from a whole family of postal workers. Both my grandfather and my father ran post offices. I guess that's how I ended up becoming a stamp collector. I'm only running for the local government, so I have nothing to do with the postal privatization... The privatization bill passed today actually. You know, after the election, I'd like to hold small exhibitions of my stamp collections at different post offices. MOCHIDA JAPANESE COMMUNIST PARTY We'd like to create a city where everyone can get married and have children without hardship. This is Ohta Kimiko of the Democratic Party of Japan. Ohta has lived in Kawasaki for 40 years. She's an expert on welfare, and has been fighting for the rights of the disabled for the past 20 years. Good morning! This is Yamauchi Kazuhiko from the LDP. Have a nice commute! Good morning! This is Yamauchi Kazuhiko from the LDP. Have a nice commute! Good morning! This is Yamauchi Kazuhiko from the LDP. Have a nice commute! Good morning! This is Yamauchi Kazuhiko from the LDP. Have a nice commute! Good morning. This is Yamauchi Kazuhiko from the LDP. Sorry to disturb you while on your morning commute. AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVE UNION My name is Asano Fuminao, City Councilman. I've run for the Council twice before, and if my memory serves me correctly, Yamauchi must be exhausted by now. I've been explaining to him that now is the perfect time to be making kids. I myself conceived my first child on the campaign trail. Now, Yamauchi's been married for 3 years, but he still has no kids. For some reason, one's ability to procreate gets higher under extreme conditions. So, I'd really like him to give it a try while the campaign's on. And over there is Mrs. Yamauchi. Please come down! Yamauchi, You don't have to run away from her, you know. I think she heard everything! Some of you may have seen her around town. Her name is Sayuri. She's been riding along in the campaign car saying "I'm Yamauchi's KANAI (housewife)." But don't worry, she's not an OKKANAI (scary wife). Good evening. Thanks for working so late! - We'll meet you here. - Tomorrow at 7 a.m.? No, 5 minutes before. - Can we use speakers that early? - No, you can't. But come early. Ok. I'm not finished, yet! Why did you join the rally tonight 30 minutes before planned? I'm sorry. You've got to be the judge about what to do because it is YOUR campaign! You can't just do something because the driver said you should. Sorry to raise my voice, but... No, I deserve it. Nobody'll want to support you if you're like that. It's true, I wasted 30 minutes. Some people at the rally were really pissed-off. Such a trivial matter. I thought so too. Takao was just angry because someone at the rally got angry. He's probably afraid these small mistakes are going to ruin my reputation. RAILROAD JOURNAL Yes... yes, I'm on my way. Good morning all. I am honored to be part of such a wonderful event where so many senior citizens can enjoy sports. Now we have 3 elections going on: the election for Mayor, the Diet election, and the City Council election. Our candidate for City Council, Yamauchi Kazuhiko, is here with us today, along with many other "Sensei" from the region. Thank you. Take a step forward. Hello, my name is Yamauchi Kazuhiko. Please give me your support. Good morning, this is Ohta Kimiko. Have a nice commute! Ohta Kimiko, candidate for City Council, expert on welfare. My name is Ohta. Please support me. Ohta is here in person! I'm Ohta right here. Please take one of my flyers. This is Watanabe Atsuko, candidate for City Council. Together with you, I will improve our welfare system... Good morning. - Your wife? - Yes. I'll introduce you to my people. Make sure you keep bowing, even if it's to a telephone pole. Good morning. You're all dressed up. Of course. I need to say hello to some people. I'll follow you then. You're going to carry today? No way. I'll help a little from behind but... But he was full-on at Arima. Yeah, and he hurt his back. I wasn't planning on getting in that deep. It really hurt. Just give us a little... Yeah, you say ?little? now, but later it's not so little... Please vote Yamauchi this go-around. Please tell your friends about him. "Sensei" Yamagiwa, he's the man. He's a monster. Hey, keep your mouth shut. As long as he's got this, he'll do just fine ENDORSED BY THE LDP Ladies and gentlemen, congratulations to you all. I know people in this area always support Mr. Ishida, the LDP City Councilman. But since this upcoming election is for a vacant seat, we ask that this go-around you kindly give your support to Yamauchi. Go for it, guys! Let's move on to the next place. I'll see you there. PLEASE PAY HERE This is Fujii Kazuo of the Japanese Communist Party Hello, I'm calling from the Liberal Democratic Party. At 7:30 p.m. this evening, we will hold a rally for Yamauchi Kazuhiko at the Agricultural Cooperative Union, and would be most happy if you could attend. We are using the phone list of Mr. Mochida's Supporters' Association because Yamauchi doesn't have one yet. We probably make about 700 calls a day. That's all of us together now, not each of us. Hello! Thanks for your great work. We're going to take a tea break now. How are people responding to the City Council race? They usually get silent when we bring it up. It must be because they are not familiar with it. Are you on a shift today? The afternoon shift. Who's supporters' association do you belong to? We belong to City Councilman Asano Fuminao's Association. WE WORK FOR MIYAMAE! People from various supporters association take turns and work here. Supporters of Mochida, Ishida, Yazawa, and so on. Have you supported the LDP for a long time? Yes... they're all I know. It's a family tradition going back to my grandfather's time. Some women say he looks scary in that picture. I guess he was trying to look serious. The problem is he's naturally a smirker. People have all kinds of opinions. Anyway, if he wins this race, nobody will accuse him of living off his wife. They all start that way. Asano lived off of his wife while she was teaching. Actually, the Asano's were on the brink of divorce the other day. I told him not to fight with his wife. They won't get divorced, will they? Who knows. They're pretty shaky. Have you been asked to subscribe to that paper? - Which paper? - The Komeito News. I don't know that one. It's the Komeito Party newspaper. Since the LDP is in a coalition with the Komeito now, they feel like they can just push their paper on us. Especially since I'm renting a parking space to them. I tell them ?I don't need your paper,? but they keep bothering me to sign up. I don't have to pay anything because the Komeito member will pay for me. Are these stacks of 10? Let me tell you a story. One of the city councilmen from the Communist Party asked me to rent an office space to him. So, I rented it to him. But then somebody phoned the LDP's headquarters and made a big fuss saying, "How can an official of the LDP rent a space to communists?? It was a big scandal. Asano called to interrogate me. So I told him, "Yeah, I rented it to him because he asked me to." "And that's the way I earn my living!? Call these people first. They are the priority. "Thank You List? Hello, This is Yamauchi Kazuhiko's housewife calling... Can they hear you? You don't have to talk so low, you know. Well now it was... Ok, I'll try a little louder. Yamauchi needs to form his own supporters' association once he's elected. 'Cause we won't be able to help him in the next election, you know? Of course, this is a one-shot deal. We have our own "Sensei" to support. I even told Yamauchi to his face that I won't help him next time. That's right. He should certainly understand that. See that woman standing across the street... she's psychotic. That woman? When she was still sane, she had long hair and big tits. She called herself the "Marilyn Monroe of Kawasaki.? Is she crazy now? Totally. Is she from around here? She lives over in Tsuchihashi. She used to work for the DMV, when Masahiro was in charge. He ended up having to fire her on account of her ?strange behavior.? She'd always get overly excited every time a man she knew came into the office. I think at that point she was already beginning to lose it. I can't count anymore. Can't concentrate? She's always over there. She's been standing there for a long time now. What's she doing? Whoops, looks like your lover's calling I really shouldn't say things like that. You know she's just like my cat. Cats can sit in one place for hours. They're really patient. Look, now she's talking to herself... giggling. It's disgusting. I've got to go now. Sorry to leave you... See you later. Bye now. She doesn't even recognize "Sensei" Mochida anymore. She used to have a major crush on him. But by then she was already a little off. I know one of the big bosses over at Bereaved War Families' Association. Maybe Yamauchi can ask for his support. The LDP is weak in that area because of all the new residents. But aren't there still some farmers over there? He should approach them. I also have some people I can introduce him to. And if I go around introducing Yamauchi to these people, I could also get to know some new people and expand our own supporters' association. And, we'll need the local politicians' support when my brother runs in the next Diet election. I know that in this neighborhood, you're all supporting City Councilman Ishida. But this time the election is for a vacant seat that was previously occupied by the LDP. So, please vote for Yamauchi this time so we can regain this seat. When the election is over, you'll all be free to return to "Sensei" Ishida. Yamauchi will build his own constituency once he gets elected. We'll all support you, you know... but only this time! We're pretty loyal to Mr. Ishida. Yes, you're exactly right. You should all support "Sensei" Ishida. Ln a sense, you can think of Ishida like your ?nationality.? We're not asking you to change your ?nationality.? After the election, Yamauchi will organize people who don't have any ?nationality? yet, to be in his camp. I hope you understand. So, Mr. Yamauchi, you must have some aspirations if you're running for public office. What exactly are they? Aspirations? So, not my ?platform?, but my ?personal hopes?, right? Whatever you want to call it. And if we like what you say, we just might switch from Ishida to you! Please vote for me just this once. After that, please go back to Mr. Ishida. Just this once! I'm here to reform Kawasaki's government. I'm Yamauchi. Other candidates have done something for this area, but your bio shows you have done nothing... Right. So, I'm voting. for someone who's done something here, although I support the LDP at the national level. For the City Council, I need to choose someone local. Actually, the LDP didn't have any good candidates from here. Nobody local wanted to run for the seat because it's too costly. You're not Koizumi, you know? I know. Please put a good word out there for me. I'll work hard for this city. Good evening, My name is Yamauchi. I'm Yamauchi from the LDP. I'm committed to reform. I'll advance reforms. Someone told me I should quit my job. What for? ...They said I should think about the future. That's not a good idea. They told me that I should repay all of the supporters by quitting... But I'm the one who needs to repay. So I said to them, "What happens if we lose the election? We'd both be out of work.? Then, they said to me, "Don't think about losing. You should only think about winning!? I mean, the only people who can talk like that are rich people. 'Cause I'll tell you right now if we lose we're going to be totally broke. That's right. And besides, they're ignoring my human rights. Ln Kawasaki, there are many double-income-no-kids couples, not to mention all the young working mothers. And we're trying to represent the interests of the young generation. Lt is so backwards for them to tell me to quit my job. I almost said to them, I'll quit my job when my husband becomes Prime Minister.? You shouldn't say that. And what happens to single "Sensei" like Mochida or Yamagiwa? See? It's your fault. It's because you're so weak that they talk to me like that. Oh, so now you're blaming me? Come on, don't get upset. Can't you just stay calm? You don't have to quit your job. Just please don't talk back to them. And don't take them seriously, that's all. Wow, you're really riled-up. Looks like another delivery notice. No need to get angry. You're just being immature if you get angry at what these people say to you. Yes, I'm immature. But when something needs to be said, I have to say it. - No, you don't. - Really? All you need to do is to pretend to listen. And you don't have to promise them anything. Let's sleep. This is Yamauchi Kazuhiko. We really appreciate your support! Hello Ma'am, yes, I see you waving from your window. Thank you very much! This is Watanabe Atsuko from the Kanagawa Network. KOIZUMI IS COMING! This is a map of Saginuma Station. The Prime Minister is coming today. This illustrates our security plan. This is top secret, you know. Don't go leaking this to anyone. All of you who are working as security guards, please wear this pink sticker so that people will know. This guy's just faking it actually. Here. This is the area we're in charge of. All around the Agricultural Cooperative Building. Is there anyone who hasn't put this sticker on? This will show the police officers that you're not a terrorist. Hey, ask them if they're terrorists before you give them the sticker. Prime Minister Koizumi Junichiro is coming to show his support for our candidates. In a moment, Prime Minister Koizumi will arrive, so please take a moment to hear him speak. Hello, everyone. My name is Mochida, Prefectural Assemblyman from this district. After a careful selection process of candidates from the general public, we have endorsed Yamauchi Kazuhiko. Hello. This is Ishida Yasuhiro, City Councilman elected from this district. Mr. Yamauchi has made a name for himself in business dealing stamps and coins. To change our government, we need someone like him... someone who can carefully monitor budgets and spending with the shrewd eye of a successful businessman. My name is Yamauchi Kazuhiko. Since 2001, many people have told me that my face looks similar to the Prime Minister's. But my face is not the only thing I share with him. With the Prime Minister, I share the same passion toward reform. And as such, I ask you humbly for your support, and your vote. Thank you very much for your time. Good job. This is Kawaguchi Yoriko. Hello everyone. Mr. Koizumi, I'm Yamauchi. Thanks for waiting, everyone. Please welcome our Prime Minister, Koizumi Junichiro. Since 1972, the voters of the region have chosen him as their representative to the National Diet. Now, he is the top politician in the country. Remember the way we won the last Diet election. The last election became a referendum on postal privatization. Please stay on the other side of the rope. It's dangerous. And we'll continue to advance reform thanks to the leadership of this man, Prime Minister, Koizumi. Yamauchi and Yamagiwa are also supporting Kawaguchi's efforts, as are the members of the Komeito Party. Thanks so much for listening. Please cast your vote for Kawaguchi. Prime Minister, I'm Yamauchi and I'm committed to the reforms. Now, the Prime Minister is on his way to the next location... I saw your speech! You were lucky to have your banner up there until the end. We were supposed to take it down. I wish I'd been allowed to be up there with Koizumi. I shook hands with Koizumi twice. Thank you, "Sensei" Mochida. That was some great publicity you got. I wish we could have allowed you to be up there, but it was impossible. I was lucky my name was still up. Let's just say we forgot to take it down. Good for you. I shook hands with Koizumi twice! Tomorrow we have the mayor. The organizational power of the LDP machine is huge, isn't it? Party endorsement means that everyone in LDP supports you. So it's unthinkable to turn against the party if you're elected. Good morning, everyone. Today is the final day of the campaign. Yamauchi Kazuhiko would like to ask for your support one last time today. Ma 'am! Thank you for shaking hands with our candidate. Your hand is warm. I'm Yamauchi, please support me. What is the election for? There's a by-election for the City Council. There're just too many elections to keep track of. Good luck, anyway. Excuse me for interrupting... I'm Yamauchi, and I'll work hard for this city. Thank you, this is Ohta Kimiko, and we are the Democratic Party of Japan. This is Fujii Kazuo of the Japanese Communist Party. I'm running for City Council. Tomorrow is the City Council election. The Kanagawa network has endorsed Watanabe Atsuko as our candidate. This is Ichii, City Councilwoman of Yamato city. I'm here to support my colleague Watanabe Atsuko. ISHIHARA NOBUTERU MINISTER OF LAND, INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSPORT You look scary on TV. That must be my brother! But you look cute in person. Kawasaki is a city designated by ordinance, so they have a big budget. The task of the City Council is very large. This is my last chance to ask for your support. This is Yamauchi, Yamauchi Kazuhiko. This is Yamauchi. Please give me your vote. We are now entering the final hour of our campaign. My name is Yamauchi, and I need your one last push. Please send me to the City Council so that I can advance reform. This is my final appeal. My name is Yamauchi Kazuhiko, and I am begging for your cooperation. Mayor Abe, Banzai, Banzai, Banzai! Do you know how many people voted before today? WINNER: KAWAGUCHI YORIKO WINNER: ABE TAKAO KAWAGUCHI YORIKO, LDP ELECTED TO THE DIET Let's hope we have a "Banzai? here, too. Yamauchi Headquarters. This is the number Yamada confirmed. YAMAUCHI: 7000 OHTA: 5500 WATANABE: 3000 FUJII: 1000 Yamauchi Headquarters. Pretty close to the Democrat. Closer than I thought. Are you sure you got the right number? What? That's too vague. Yes, please. Now they're saying it's a dead heat. But they don't have any numbers. What? You need to tell me something more concrete. Right now? What? Too close to call? I understand. They are telling me that it's too close to call right now. Too close to call? Are we losing? They can't give me any numbers. Boy, that's frightening. Who's reporting it? Shin-chan's reporting from the office. Can we trust him? News reporters are also saying it's too close. Reporters, too? Sounds like trouble. Struggling? They say it's still too close to call. Must be a real close race. Close race... Democrats are doing great with this low voting rate. Pick it up! Wrong line. Hello. They're going to announce the final results in a few minutes. The result is already on the website. You mean the final result? Yes. It seems we won. 20,544 and 19,534 By 1000 votes. That's close. 20,544 to 19,544 That's really only 1000 votes apart. Is everyone in? - Where's Yamauchi? - He's not here yet. - Isn't he outside? - No, he's at home. He was supposed to be waiting outside. - How do we address him now? - "Sensei Yamauchi." Is he a "Sensei" now? Damn. At home? Hurry up! Everyone's waiting for you. Lt takes about 5 minutes, doesn't it? No, 15 minutes at least. I told him to wait outside. Is he at home? A 40-year-old should know better... Totally unheard of that... a candidate keeping so many important "Sensei" waiting... I'm sorry, "Sensei." I'll reprimand him tomorrow. Please be patient... If this was the samurai age, he'd have to commit HARA-KIRI. Is he here? Thank god. He's here. Thank you everyone. We celebrate the birth of City Councilman Yamauchi Kazuhiko. Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! As "Sensei" Hirako from Komeito supported us, it's thanks to the various organizations that worked so hard for this campaign that we were able to come out on top of this severe battle. The final number tells us that our party is in a difficult position. Mr. Yamauchi should realize that he's indebted to everyone here. He should also be aware that he is succeeding a great city councilman Koizumi Akio, and that he's only been given... a ?learner's permit? until he wins the next election. I'm amazed you all worked so hard to support a person like me. I'm indebted to all of you for your generous support. I think I am the luckiest man on earth. Now, it is my turn to pay you back. From this very moment, I will start repaying you in anyway I can. Thank you so much for everything. Let's raise a toast. City Council Chairman, "Sensei" Yazawa, please lead us. CAMPAIGN "Sensei," Thank you very much... YAMAUCHI KAZUHIKO YAMAUCHI SAYURI ASANO FUMINAO ISHIDA YASUHIRO ISHIHARA NOBUTERU OGIWARA KENJI KAWAGUCHI YORIKO Sleep well, Yamauchi...
