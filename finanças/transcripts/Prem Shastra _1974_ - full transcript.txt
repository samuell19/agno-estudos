What has happened to me? No, Kamini. You are absolutely alright. I was telling you just like that. If Riya comes here, it would be better to you. She has her vacations too. Actually, she is my only sister-in-law. [LAUGHS] I don't want others to know our family problems. Which problem, Kamini? About me being ill. [LAUGHS] You are not sick, Kamini. Everybody says that... ...I am possessed by evil spirits. Do not believe on somebody else, okay? [GASPS] [GASPS] [MOANING] You went to sleep. Oh, Kamini. What are you doing? You should take rest, right? Why? This work is also comfortable. My daughter, since so long I am trying to tell you not to work. But you don't pay heed to me. Come on my daughter.

No no! This evening, both of us will go and we'll definitely go. This evening belongs to Prem and Kamini. Hey daughter-in-law, give it to me. It is 5:00 p.m. Prem must be on his way to home. Prem and you are going somewhere, right? Yes! He did say so. Go and get ready. Shalu will come from college. Both of us will do the rest. Go and get ready. Okay! Hello, can I talk to Mr. Kapur? Yes! I am Prem speaking. Hello! How are you? I am fine. Be ready in the evening, we'll go for a walk in the evening. - Okay? - Yes! Sure. - Bye. - Okay, bye. No, Kamini. He will not come today too. What is it? Why did you call me here? You could have met me in college, right? Hey! Don't blabber! You must have been called for some work, right? Oh... I know your actions very well. You fall flat upon seeing... ...a beautiful girl. Don't blabber too much. Otherwise I'll whack you. I have no business with you. Go from here. My darling, my dear, have this peanut. Push off! I don't want to eat. I have a big problem. What? Whenever you are angry... ...I find you extremely handsome. Hey, you! Tea. Where is your tea? I had it. Is it? Without me? Fine. Sit besides me. Mother must be waiting for me in the house of worship. - Kamini, I have to say something. - Yes, go on. Kamini. Kamini you for a few days, Will you not tell me what is the matter? There is nothing as such. Perhaps you have started being more busy with work,... ...so you must have thought so. Kamini. I can understand that your life will be difficult in my absence. Am I right? These are petty matters of life. You don't worry about them. Moreover, it was you who said... ...that you have to lose something to achieve something. But this is wrong, Kamini, I want to achieve everything with you. Which is impossible. What do you mean? I don't know. But I know that... ...when the night is foggy... ...moon loses it's light. And when foggy full night falls,... ...the moonlight disappears. It becomes invisible. But moonlight will appear some time, right? You need to wait till the night for that. And what if that night foggy might returns? Then? Then the new moon day arrives. Moon becomes invisible. Kamini, it's not that I don't know... ...what you want to say. I understand your pain. Today is Sunday. This evening, we will both go for an excursion. And I will really be in front of your eyes. I won't go anywhere. Hey! I want a smile. Smile! [LAUGHING] You look pretty, when you smile. One more thing. This evening we will go to dad. We have not met him ever since we got married. Don't you want to meet Riya? - What should I say? - Hey! Please! Say something, will you? I've got an idea. Let's do one thing. Do not you call Dad. We'll surprise him. We will give him surprise! What do you say? - Hmm. - Okay? Lets go! We'll work afterwards. Oh ho! Who do you intend to woo today, sister? Be careful, brother-in-law! I can't hate the crocodile by staying in the water. If you are going there... ...then convey my regards to Riya. - Oh, is that so? - Tell her my condition is bad as I miss her. What did you say? Your condition is bad? Oh, mom... This is between me and my sister-in-law. Actually I'm habitual of having the food prepared by her. So please come fast. Otherwise my condition will be bad. What did you say? Nothing! That's what. [TELEPHONE RINGING] This phone keeps ringing on Sunday too. Hello! Wait. - Brother. - What happened? It is GM sir's phone. Should I make an excuse? - Hey, don't do that. - You are so strange. Mom, please put some sense in him. He just keeps blabbering. Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Okay, sir! Yes sir! Yes! Sir, I will reach in half and hour. Yes, sir. I'm sorry, Kamini. I'll have to go. Some delegates have come from Japan and they are staying at Taj. You do one thing. Take your sister-in-law, okay? No. We'll go later. - Well... - Brother, you're so... I am not a lazy guy. I have to go on duty. Okay, mom! Bye. Hey! I have to go from here. See you! Oh, no! Why so fuss about duty? As is there is nothing in life apart from work! Kamini! Your love is not yours. You have no existence in front of his work and principles. He does not care about you, Kamini! He does not care about you! He is selfish! Self-centered! He is a machine! Kamini, you are married to a machine! He just fools around with you. You're mere a puppet for him. Prem doesn't love you! Prem doesn't care about you. He doesn't cares about your feelings. No! Oh, God! Prem is a fraud! He is fraud! His love for you is false! - He is a fraud! - "Why loneliness troubles me when I'm not busy?" "Why loneliness troubles me when I'm not busy?" "I'm scared of my own shadows." "Why do you taunt me oh, mirror?" "Why have you lost your glow?" "Why do you taunt me oh, mirror?" "Why have you lost your glow?" "Why did my dreams like glasses broke and shattered?" So I am leaving, mom. Listen, son. I want to tell you something. What is it, mom? Do you remember son? When you were a child, I used to tell you a story. Yes! I remember it well. But, maybe you don't remember that story. Which one, mom? The story in which... ...the prince goes to the sky to take the moon... ...and forgets his way to the earth while returning. Mom, I can understand what you are saying. Then why are you forcing me to say. Mom, situations make a man helpless. Son, even I'm afraid of that. I don't want you to get drowned in this whirl of situations. Son, we are happy in whatever condition we are in. Pay attention to daughter-in-law. Can't you see her plight? She needs you, son! Okay! Okay! I will not give you any chance to complain. This evening we are going out for an excursion. I will come at the right time. That's is my promise, mom. Okay? I love you. - I love you mom. Bye! - [SIGHS] Well done my boy! Well done! - Where have you reached? - Good Morning, sir. Good Morning! Any problem? Sir, not as such. I have achieved a little. Okay. But the month is about to end. We have still not yet sent the details to Japan. There are many more pending orders. Sir, I need another week's time. Okay. I hope you'll be successful. Keep up with the same passion. - Okay. - Thank you, sir. Thank you. 'I am so sorry, Kamini.' 'Today I dined with with Mr. GM.' 'Okay, do one thing.' 'The sooner you eat,... ...the sooner I come fresh.' 'Please!' 'Okay?' Kamini. 'I can understand that you must be missing me a lot.' 'Am I right?' 'These are the petty matters of life.' 'You don't worry about it.' 'Moreover, it was you who said that... ...you have to lose something to achieve something.' 'But it is wrong Kamini.' 'I want to achieve everything with you.' 'It is impossible.' - [SHOCKED] - Aaahhhh! - What happened, sister? - [GASPS] When did you come? I have just come. What has happened to your hands? Oh, nothing. It's a minor scratch. What is this sister? And your eyes? Nothing happened. What has happened to my eyes? Sister, you are crying! Look, since my marriage, my father did not come to meet me even once. He didn't even make a call. I think he has forgotten me. Did not even take my news. Now is it wrong if I cry? It is not like that, sister. Dad loves you a lot! You know that he goes out in the morning for work... ...and then returns in the evening. He is a doctor, after all. He loves his patients so much that... ...he doesn't remembers anything. Sister, mom had the same dream, right? Dad loves mom so much, right? If mother was alive today, she would have been so happy to see this. Leave all this. Tell me, how are you? You don't even remember me, do you? - No, there is no such thing sister. - I know. I know. Absolutely not! I caught her with great difficulty, sister. [LAUGHS] As if he brought me here. Have you seen your face? Exactly like a monkey. [MOCKS] Hey, Riya! Don't make me angry. Should I hold you in front of her? Riya, why do you say this to him? About his brother-in-law of yours! He thinks too much about himself. He always keeps teasing me. [MOCKS] You silly. Yash loves you. - What! - Yes. Riya, he is the one who takes care of me. When he is around I lose track of time. Okay, you both talk. I'll come now. Leave me! What are you doing? Someone will come. Hey, this is an opportunity! Come hold in my arms. [CLEARING THROAT] Sister! Well, tea leaves. Tea leaves are over there. Oh... I will come soon sister. Okay. Sister, I'll head home. Some guests are going to come. I will call you, or you call me, I will go. Drink tea. Why? Will you not call me again? Hey! I want to call you forever. But it will take a little time. Listen. Don't bother him so much. He loves you very much. Okay. - Bye! - Bye! [APPLAUSE] [CLOCK TICKING] [CAR STOPS] - Mom! - [CAR DOOR CLOSE] Mom! Mom, where are you? Mom! - What happened? Why are you screaming? - [CHUCKLES] Mom, I am very happy! - But what happened? - Mom. Your son has succeeded today. All your blessings have worked for me! [LAUGHING] Oh! Mother's blessings never go in vain. Will you tell me or make up things like this? Mom, the experiment I did, it is successful. - Is it? - [LAUGHING] Your son has won! Now the whole world will salute your son! - What do you say, Yash? - Brother, it's all your hard work. And we are proud of you, brother. My doll! Come here. Give me a hug! Mom, no one will have any complaints with me. Hey, can anyone complain against you? Mother but someone has a complaint. Are you talking about daughter-in-law? If she listens, she will go crazy! But you have made a mistake. You should have at least called. Since when she has been waiting, Now go to her. She has the first right on this good news. Kamini. Are you upset with me? Kamini. Forgive me this time. Punish me however you want. But don't be angry today. Today is a very happy day for me... ...and I have got it after so many difficulties. My desire to achieve it has... ...turned my life upside down. What do you think of yourself? Why do you show my position again and again? If you don't have time,... ...why do you show me dreams? I don't want to live in dreams Kamini. What are you saying? Relax, please! Relax? Kamini, you don't know anything. I know everything! What do you know? Everything. You know nothing. We are going to Khandala tomorrow, okay? Liar. You are again showing me a dream. I am not making this up. I swear on your love. Wow! Nice room. Wonderful and the bed is also good. Sir, can I get something for you? Get two cold drinks for me. Okay, sir. I will get it right away. - Wait. Relax. - Okay. Sir, I will get it right away. - Keep this too. - Thank you, sir! I'll get cold drinks for you. Do call me, if you need anything, okay? - Okay! Get it fast! - Please, sir. Thank you, sir. Nice room, isn't it? Now only you and me are in this room. What do you think? [LAUGHING] Leave me, will you? Hey! What are you saying? We are not here to leave this place. Today nothing is going to happen! Because I am unwell. What? Does this mean you will spoil my honeymoon? Please! - [LAUGHS] - Oh, God! The room is good, anyway. I lied to you! - [CHUCKLES] - Was it? Really? You lied to me! Oh, great! Wow! [MOANING] And you slept. [TELEPHONE RINGING] [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello! Yes, give me the line, please. Hello, Mr. Prem.

Because your happiness should be my happiness too! What are you saying, Kamini? What else should I say? You only care about your happiness. I wish you had tried to know about my happiness too. I wish you cared about my desires too. But no! Neither did you ever feel it's importance. But why? You have only cared about your work,... ...happiness and your own lust! Kamini! Yes! Yes your lust! Home, bed, life! It's all about your happiness all the time. I'm nothing but a toy for you! You expect me to dance... ...to your tunes all the time! I have no existence of my own! I have no life of my own! I am not a woman but mere a puppet! [CRYING] Please, Kamini! Please try to understand me! Kamini, try to understand me! Please, Kamini! Don't cry! Please try to understand me! Don't cry, Kamini! [VEHICLE APPROACHING] Hey, Prem! You were going to come after five days, right? Why did you come today? Yes, mom. We had to cut short our vacation due to office work. Prem, tell me what is it? Why are you shooting around the bush? Nothing much. GM sir had called me up. I'll have to go to Japan. - When? - Tomorrow. Kamini doesn't understands anything. Don't be angry, son. She will gradually understand it. Okay, mom. I have to go to GM sir. I am running late. - I have to go. - Hey, drink fresh tea. No mom. I am running late. I'll have it later, okay? [ENGINE REVVING] Daughter-in-law. Daughter-in-law! Kamini. I am going for three months.

[SOBS] Then I will not be able to go either. Okay. I will take your leave. Are you upset? No. So how did you forget? [WEEPING] No! Don't cry, Kamini. [HUMMING] You have grown so much. But you are not conscious about your clothes. Now I can't carry on like this. Start working and get me a daughter-in-law. She will do everything for you. Hello, sister! - [SHOCK] - Without pants? Hello, brother! [LAUGHS] Come, brother. He is very shy! You sit. Why are you standing? I have just come to see my daughter's home. This house belongs to you too. You can come whenever you want. Dad! Oh, my daughter! Dad! Come to me, my dear. How are you my girl? I make tea for you. Hey! Why are you in such a hurry? My daughter makes very good tea. Go daughter and make two cups of tea. But does she know where it is? - I know everything. - What! I will give Yash the pant. He must be waiting. Ma'am, I will give him pant. I will also bring tea. - Okay? - Bye. Dear, what shall I'll tell you? Daughter, when I hear your voice on the phone, I feel relieved. I cannot tell you what I think. Then have you ever thought about me? Something are such that you have to... ...ignore in spite of knowing everything. You stay happy in this house. Riya does pays visit to you. I see your glimpse in her. - Anyway, I'm your future wife. - Yes! And you love me too. Why are you shy from me? Fine. Wear your pant and meet my dad, who is downstairs. [SHOUTS] All are waiting for tea. Come down for now. Come. Hey, daughter! Where are you? You have still not brought the tea. Come fast! [LAUGHS] This uncontrollable youth. Moreover these lonely nights. I can spend my day somehow. But night is tough to spend. Men are so strange kind. At first they make a habit and then leave in agony. What about men? They can find their prey anywhere they want. It us who are left to suffer. I never yearn, dear. You've still the same as you were in college, right? What do you mean? Habit of blabbering! Wow! What a body! What a muscle! I will not leave! I will enjoy him the whole night. Are you crazy? He is a model. So what, I have such a remedy... ...that I can call anyone whenever I want. Where do you even find such remedies? Kamini, I am not joking. When Sardar ji is not home,... ...I call whoever I want. I do whatever I want with him. You too try this recipe and your loneliness will come out of fun. Leave it. You do all this, I bring tea for you. Forget it. Is tea even a drink? Listen, I can tell you something useful. Come here! Think about a man, close your eyes and take a deep breath. And then think more about him. And then gradually he'll come towards you... And then you'll make him dance on your tune. He will be your slave for life! Keep your crap with you. I don't want to call anyone. Hey! Its 7 p.m! I have to go to the party. I'm leaving. - When will you come again? - I will come soon. [WIND BLOWING] Without you I am so lonely. [WIND BLOWING] [THUNDERING CLOUDS] - No, I won't do this. - [THUNDERING CLOUDS] [THUNDERING CLOUDS] But it's not wrong to try it once. No. It's a sin. Let's try it out. Come on. Come closer. Whatever I'm doing, is it something that a wife shouldn't do? But what was happening to me was right? Prem only cares about his work. The model is mine. He behaves exactly what I want him to do. Model is mine! Only mine. Whatever I'm doing, is it against the duty of a wife? Kamini. - Yes. - why are you not eating food? I will eat. I will have it, mother. Let me feed you. Where were you lost? Here, have it. [TELEPHONE RINGING] [TELEPHONE RINGING] - [TELEPHONE RINGING] - [PAPER RUSTLE] - Hello. - Mom, it's me, Prem! Mother, I am coming tomorrow. - Son, are you coming tomorrow? - Yes, mom! Mom, I am coming tomorrow! Inform Kamini! Okay, my son. I'll tell her. You take care of yourself. No! Oh, God! Please help me! [CRYING] Please help me! Okay, son. Bye! Good. Kamini, slowly open your eyes. Kamini, you are in your present now. Your Prem is with you. Open your eyes. You are with your friend. Yes. Her name is Dr. Mehta. Good. I am feeling dizzy. Relax. Try to get up slowly. Slowly. What did doctor say? Nothing. You're fine. She must have told you something, right? No. She has called you to the clinic tomorrow to give medicines. What is the matter? You look a bit upset, [TELEPHONE RINGING] - Hello! - I'm waiting for you with wine and savouries! Yes sir, I'll arrive soon! Come fast! Otherwise the liquor will get warmed. Yes, sir. I arrive soon, sir. Come soon, will you? You've been saying this for too long. Okay, sir. Okay. Kamini, I have to go. I can stop if you want. No you go. You need fame, don't you? Kamini... Why are you looking at me like this? No, nothing. You go. Okay. I will go. - [BACKGROUND MUSIC] - [WIND BLOWING] Kamini, how are you feeling now? I am good. But what has happened to me? - Which disease do I have? - Nothing. You are absolutely fit and fine. Wait. I want to show you something. Stop it! Stop it, I say! I cannot see it any-more! Stop this! Stopped it. At least you recognized yourself. How? Who allowed you to interfere in my personal life? Kamini, I'm not only a doctor but your friend too. I consider it my duty to tell you the truth of your life. You know when I recorded the cassette? When you were alone in bed. You had lost your senses. Kamini, when you are alone on your bed... ...you are in another world. Your obsession takes over you. It's a kind of a fantasy. In that world, you have a man. With whom you have a physical relationship. And he fulfils you with happiness. But in reality nobody is with you, You are alone in reality. You do it all by yourself But you don't realize it. You both have created this situation for yourself. I want you both to understand that... ...the bond between husband and wife is very fragile. In this relationship, Physical union... ...and satisfaction plays a very important role. Well, there is nothing to worry about. This is your first stage and... ...it can be cured. Many people are victims of this disease in this country. Most of the times, they don't just lose... ...their sanity but they end up dying too. Kamini, it is not your only mistake. Prem is also a part of it. Prem, you never tried to understand Kamini's needs. I know you are very ambitious. You have many responsibilities. But you should also take care of your wife. I am really very sorry. Nothing to feel ashamed of. Sex is something that keeps you longing forever. This is a bond that retains self-respect... ...between husband and wife. [SIGHS] Prem, take this book and read it. It has all the information about your shortcomings. This book will help you in fulfilling it. And listen to me, Take Kamini away from here for few days as soon as possible. Kamini will also feel good. And you will also get time to read this book. Thank you, doctor. Thank you very much. Both of us will leave tomorrow. I hope that you will give the good news... ...regarding the third member soon as you come. How should I thank you doctor? You are not only a doctor, but a Goddess. Only elders of our family can explain us like this. I promise, now both of us will continue to understand each other. I am not a Goddess but a human. I am a doctor. I am a psychiatrist. And I believe in talking to humans more than medicines. I wish you all the best. - Thank you. - Thank you, doctor. Take care of my daughter-in-law. Mom, I am going to do the same. Daughter-in-law, you keep calling, okay? Okay. Stay blessed. Brother in law! You again cheated me, right? You were leaving without informing me! Well, had Yash not... - No. I didn't... - Tell him! - Well, marketing... He was buying stuffs. Come! - Yes. Okay. Marketing? Stuffs? Yes. Show me your ears. Come close. Please come over here. You think you are smart, right? I know everything about you. I also know everything about you. [GIGGLES] - Sister. - What is it? - Please book a room for us too. - Why? - Why will we go so late? - Where to? Sister, for honeymoon! Push off! How cheesy! What is happening there? I don't know. Please keep it in mind, okay? Crazy fellow! [CHUCKLES] Okay, mom! Now we'll leave. - Okay, mom. - Come. - See you brother. - Okay! Bless you. See you, sister. If you allow may I leave now? - Go ahead. - [CHUCKLES] Okay. Listen! Don't forget to read 'Prem Shastra', okay? [LAUGHS] [ENGINE REVVING] Bye!
