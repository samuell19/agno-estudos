Subtitles by explosiveskull Welcome to the World Extreme Games. Up next, we have Tommy Schooner, attempting his calling card, the "Schoonerama." This is an incredibly difficult trick. Tommy is the only one to successfully pull off this daring maneuver in competition. He's beginning his approach, gathering speed. There's no turning back now! Oh! And Tommy Schooner is down! Trash can: 30, Tommy: 0. You okay? Yeah. Ugh. I really thought you had it that time. I didn't. You think you have one more in you? I think we've done enough damage for one day. You're probably right. I have to go home for dinner soon anyway. Ooh! Watcha having? Steak? I could really go for a steak. You wanna take the footage home? Add it to the collection? Uh, we get anything good? Yeah, we got some cool stuff of... Buddy. As usual. And plenty of you falling. As usual. Thanks, I'll be sure to use those. See you tomorrow? Yeah, first day of summer break. Yeah, freedom! Oh! I can smell dinner. Steak! Give me my board, Tommy. Come on! Come on! Give me my board. No. That smells like vegetables. Your flight comes in on Thursday, right? Yup, mid-morning. The tour scheduled a car for me. Should I meet you guys at the office? That'd be perfect. Can you grab your board? I wanna look at it, make sure it's holding up all right. It's holding up great. No problems at all. The trucks were a little tight but I loosen them. Hey, guys. Oh! Hey, Tommy. How was the skateboarding? Don't ask. What's for dinner? It was... okay. Hey, Sally. Hey, Tommy. Looking sharp in the get-up. Oh. Yeah. Thanks. Oh, man, quinoa? Gross. How's London? Great. It's such a cool city. I'm ready for the tour to be over, though. Bring me back anything cool? Actually, that reminds me, make sure you come home with your new board. We wanna make sure that they can see that you're definitely using the Mark III on the competition circuit. Yes, Dad, you mentioned that yesterday. Oh. Right, sorry. Uh, I've got some ideas on the new campaign, too. I've got some mock-ups I can show you in the office. Smells great, Mom, what is it? Garbage. I'm gonna try to order delivery. I am calling it "quinoa-meanwa." It's got kale, quinoa and tofu... and a whole lot of spices. Everything a growing boy needs. And no meat? Hey, you two promised that we would eat my way on Sundays, all right? I'm just kidding, I'm sure it's delish. Uh, I'll be back when it's ready? Uh, no, you'll be back five minutes before it's ready, so you can set the table. Probably in about 20. All right, will do. Come on, Bud. I don't see what's so funny. Those were some sick moves. Tommy, dinner's ready. Okay, be right down. He can rush down for "quinoa-meanwa," but I'm holding out for real food. I'm Buddy, by the way. Bulldog. Man's best friend. Skateboarder extraordinaire. The filmmaker you saw is my best mate Tommy. A couple months ago, he took up skateboarding. I'm not sure why, he's not so great at it. His sister, Sally, on the other hand, she was the one calling from London, she's one heck of a skater. She's so good in fact, a few months ago, she went onto some sort of world skateboarding tour. It's pretty cool. This year, Sally became the face of Modern Skate, the skate company that Tommy's parents started. I don't totally understand how all the business stuff works, because, you know, I'm a dog, but I think it's working out pretty well. Oh, yeah, and that's Alice, she's Tommy's best friend. Well, after me. She's really cool. She likes to make movies, too. She gives great belly rubs. Buddy, dinner! Oh, man, the good stuff! Come on! Dig in, Buddy. Thank you. Okay. Smells great, Mom. Well, it tastes even better. George? - Dinner. - Oh. Sorry. Sally seems super stoked for the new campaign. I can't wait to see her Thursday. Oh. Did she say how the tour was going? Yeah, great, yeah, she's definitely the crowd favorite. She said at the autograph tent yesterday, her line was twice as long as the others. That's awesome. Yeah, we couldn't buy this kind of publicity. Yeah, well, we could, but it'd be expensive. Yeah, well, we definitely are fortunate. So, Tommy, how was your day? Pretty good. Oh, I'm getting better at the move... You know, I was thinking, I wonder if anyone else on the tour would wanna be part of the campaign. Uh, I don't know. And I really don't think that we have it in the budget to have another spokesperson. So, Tommy, you were saying... Yeah, yeah, you're right. Besides, Sally should be enough, she's the best. This meeting just has to go perfect on Friday, I really wanna knock their socks off. But tomorrow we should go over the posters again, gotta nail the layout. May I be excused? Also, Jerome should dial in Sally's board, and we have some backups ready, too. You know, we don't want anything to go wrong in the demo. You agree? What? What? What'd I do? Tommy was trying to tell you how his skateboarding went today. What? Oh, well, gee, I'm sorry. Yeah, you should know I'm amped for this meeting. If we wow the investors, it could take the company global. I know. But will you please just spend some time with Tommy this week? Yeah, I will. What is this stuff anyway? Let me try this. Quinoa. - What is it? - Quinoa. Well, it looks... looks delicious. Yeah, it looks great. Hmm. Hold on. Yeah, it's Mr. Hoffman. Hello, Mr. Hoffman? Hello, George. I'm just calling to make sure we're still on track for our meeting. My time is valuable, and I don't want to waste it. Yes, sir, absolutely, sir. Everything is coming together very well, I think you're going to be impressed. Excellent. Time is money, George, and I will not waste either one. Great, uh, looking forward to meeting you. Thank you. All right, bye. This meeting's going to be great. Are you going to finish your... great dinner? Yeah, yep. Can you pass me whatever's in that bowl? It's called tofu and vegetables. You should get to know them. Can you just eat it like normal food, though? Mmm-hmm. They can be your friends, unlike pizza. - Pizza's my friend. - Mmm. Okay. I'm late for school! Wait a minute... It's summer break. Morning, sleepyhead. Hey, there, Tommy. Hey, guys. Welcome to the world, sleepyhead. Oh. That must be Mrs. Crowley. Crotchety Crowley? What is she doing here? Be nice, she's your sitter today. Sitter? But I'm too old to have a sitter. Yes, Tommy, a sitter. You're not old enough to be home alone. I didn't have a sitter last summer. That's because Sally was here. It's just for a few days until she gets back. You can still play around the neighborhood. We're just not gonna leave you here totally by yourself. Oh, boy. Nobody in the neighborhood likes Mrs. Crowley. No candy, no TV, no loud noises. The worst. Well, welcome back, Mrs. Crowley, I know that it's been a few years. Yes, it has been. Tommy? You've gotten... taller. Thanks? Well, everything appears to be the same here. Do you still have that lovely grill out back? Uh, we do. Excellent. I would love to cook my lunch on it, I'm using a special spice rub that was taught to me by the maharaja, when I watched his children. Uh, sure, you can help yourself to the pool area and the grill. Our house is your house. Uh, okay, dear, shall we get going? Uh, yes. Hey, will you please be good for Mrs. Crowley? She always cooks weird food. It smells funny. Hey, be nice. Okay, let me know, give me a call if you need anything, and we'll be back by 6:00. - Thanks again. - Mmm. Hey, there's a new trend sweeping the nation and now I'll never know what it is. Children... and dogs... should spend their days outside. Man, I just don't get it. Sally gets to travel the world on her stupid tour, but I can't even relax on my first day off in months. A well-earned day off, algebra was a killer this year. Does anyone care what I think? Huh? "Children must spend their days outside." Kicked out of my own house. It's not like anyone pays attention to me while I'm home. - Which reminds me... - Uh, Tommy? Tommy? - ...why is it so hard for Dad to listen to me... - Tommy! You might wanna watch where you're going! Scooter! Why don't you watch where you're going? Oh, boy. That's Frankie. He's kind of got it out for Tommy for some reason. Scooter... ...the goal is to stay on your board. Didn't your sister ever teach you that? Oh, hey, Schooner... or should I say "Scooter," since that's more your speed. How's your best friend, the pavement? Ouch! Better call the doctor, someone's gonna have a bad case of road rash. Back at it again? For a smart kid, you don't learn, do you? Why don't you just leave the skateboarding to your sister? I'm sorry, Frankie, I didn't mean to run into you. I'm a good dog, but I'll bark at him a bunch if you want, Tommy. Good luck, Scooter, maybe if they add "asphalt belly flopping" as an event, you can join your sister on tour. Oh, yeah, Frankie? Why don't you put your money where your mouth is? You wanna dance, Schooner? Yeah, yeah, I do. You think you're so much better than me? Prove it. You don't wanna go down this road, Tommy. Skate-off, you and me. Pick a time. Friday, the Oaks Skate Park. You're on. I can't wait to embarrass you out there, Scooter. I'm about to tell everybody about this. Oh, yeah, Scooter! Scooter! And it's "Schooner"! Uh... what just happened? Tommy, what did you just do? I think I just challenged Frankie to a skate-off on Friday. I'm not sure though, I think I might've blacked out for a sec. Nope, you totally did. What were you thinking? I don't know, he just... What did I do? Okay. It's okay. You've been practicing a lot. I can't skate! I'm terrible at it. Well, maybe you can't beat Frankie, but at least you can avoid embarrassing yourself? Oh. You were saying? Okay, well, there's gotta be some way out of this. Nope, we shook on it. Backing out now would only be worse. I'd be the spineless kid who backed out of his own challenge. Yeah... We have to move. I hear Vancouver's nice this time of year. I can't go to Canada, I don't have a passport. I do love Canadian bacon, though. Well, now I think you might be overreacting. Do they have skateboarding in Paraguay? They do. There's literally nowhere on Earth I can escape this. Tommy! Five more minutes in the room! Don't want that computer rotting your brain! Crazy Crowley's gonna kick me out of the house again. I can't even hide, how does she always know where I am? Well, she is a babysitter, and that's kind of her job. Ah. She's ready. W-What? It... It can't be! Okay, Tommy, let's think about this, there's got to be some alternative to leaving the country. What's that smell? Mrs. Crowley's probably cooking some of her weird food. Weird? That's the sweet smell of certified angus. Somebody open this door. If Sally were here, she can give me a few pointers, maybe a trick or two? Well, we have a week, I'm sure you can learn something. But she doesn't get back till Thursday, that's way too late. What is that? It kind of smells like... Steak! No! Excellent job with the marinade, Mrs. Crowley. Is that turmeric I'm tasting? Tommy Schooner! If I could swim the English Channel as a 70-year-old, I think I can make my way out of your parents' pool! Hey, do you got a sec? Yeah, I'm just on hold with Mr. Hoffman's office. Oh, yeah, these are looking great. Yeah, what are your thoughts? Uh, I mean, I think it's a good start. - I've got a few notes for the printer. - Hmm. But I think that would be pretty good. Yeah. No, I love it. This one's great. Hello, Mrs. Crowley? He did what? I am so sorry, we will be right home. - We gotta go. - No, what about Mr. Hoffman? You're gonna have to call him back. What did she say happened? Hello, George. George? Hello? George? And here's a little extra for your dry cleaning. Again, Mrs. Crowley, we are just so sorry. Not half as sorry as you're going to be tomorrow, young lady. I'm putting you two on the babysitter blacklist until you two teach that boy and his mutt some manners! - Mrs. Crowley, if there's anything... - Mmm! Blacklist. That can't be a real thing, right? Uh, no. So, what was up with that, Tommy? - Dad, I... - You know what, I get it. You think you're too old for a babysitter, so you pushed an old woman in a pool? No, what happened was... Great way to demonstrate your maturity. I mean, if that's supposed to prove to us that you're responsible enough that you don't need a babysitter... No, I was just trying to... Don't interrupt me, young man. Just go straight up to your room. We'll call you down for dinner. Don't you think you were just a little harsh on him? Maybe. I wouldn't wanna spend all day with Mrs. Crowley, either. Well, no one does. - Hey. - Hey. See the board Sheckler just released? Doesn't look that great. Oh. So... What are we gonna do about Tommy? Oh, no luck with the babysitter? No, everyone was booked. Well, we'll try a couple in the morning. I mean, babysitter blacklist can't be a real thing. Thanks, but I meant in general, not just tomorrow. He's a pre-teen, I'm sure he's just trying to figure out who he is. Who is he? What do you mean? You and Sally... have been best buds since she was born. And I'm just a little worried that Tommy feels left out. I mean, you know that is why he started taking up all this skateboarding stuff recently. No, he always skated. No. We have always given him skateboard stuff. It's only recently that he started focusing on it. Okay, I'll talk to him this week. Uh, next week, after the pitch meeting. Okay. - Thank you. - Sure. - Good night. - Good night. Seriously, it's like, they didn't make any improvements to the last model, though, you know? Please, don't stay up all night scouting the competition. I know how you get. Just... what are they thinking? They didn't even change the graphics. George. It's like they don't wanna sell skateboards. - George. - No, that's good for us. We'll sell more. No, it's fine, we'll sell 'em, you know? - George! - Okay, good night. Love you. Are you sure? Okay, thank you. No. No one can come. I think the blacklist is a real thing. Oh, man, that just means I'm gonna have to work from home today. Well, no, that's not a good idea, the posters have to get out to the printer. I'll stay home. - Are you sure? - Yeah. No, wait, you have a meeting. No, I think it's a call... No, you're right, it's a meeting. I could come with you guys. Really? Yeah, it's cool. I could come to work with you guys, and... I'm sorry about yesterday. Well, the office isn't gonna be much fun. It's cool, I don't mind, and it is my fault that we can't get a babysitter. I promise I won't cause problems. - Can you be ready in 15? - You bet. They hand down our sentence? We're off to the big house, aren't we? It's gonna be perfect. I'm gonna pick up a few pointers at the skate company, and... Watch out, Frankie, I'm gonna get a crash course at kicking your butt. Crash course? You might wanna rethink your choice of words, Tommy. I just wanna thank you guys for letting me tag along today. I've been thinking about taking some business courses online, and I think it'll really help getting some real world experience. You can hang out in my office if you want. Tommy, my man! Haven't seen you in a minute. How's it hanging? Yeah, pretty good, I just started summer break, so... Nice. How I miss those carefree summer days. I was looking at the Mark III, by the way, sick trucks. - Thanks, buddy. - Yeah. The Mark IV is gonna blow your mind. You wanna come check out our prototype? Go ahead. - Yeah, sure. - Sweet. Welcome to the workshop. When it comes to skateboarding, it's all about manipulating the center of mass to increase the inertial payout of the bearings. Of course, it helps if you can get the coefficient of friction down to about point-five, point-two. But by increasing the drag ratio and decreasing the weight, I've hit a real Lorentzian transformation between the rider and the board, which obviously is gonna give you some ridiculous speed yields when you run it outside of the simulations. I was hoping for a business practical, not a lesson in space-time. Uh, Jerome, all this is pretty fascinating. Right? Yeah, totes, but how can I relate this to, say, a trick? Dude, like every single way possible. All right, check it. Let's say you're booking along at some velocity... V, right? And you wanna maximize your airtime and your delta T, over here, right? It's all about this integral over the cosine of the vector, which spits out your Y component, and... ultimately, the amount of force you gotta spit out on this distance, X, in relation to your fulcrum point. I think he's saying you gotta push down hard on the back of the board to make it go high, but I might've missed a step. Uh, let me start over. Uh, Jerome, I just remembered, I gotta help my mom out with... something. All good, little man. Anytime you wanna unlock the secrets to the skateboard universe, stop on by. All right, thanks. Come on, Buddy. That was fast. Ugh. Way over my head. Yeah, most people are with him. I think I noticed a miscalculation on his notes. But my trigonometry is a little rusty. Are these for the pitch meeting on Friday? Yep, gotta impress Mr. Hoffman. He represents one of the largest investment firms in Los Angeles, so if they see something they like, it could take Modern Skate to the global market, and maybe it would get your dad enough funding to get that skate park built that he's always wanted. That's exciting. Mmm-hmm. Can we get a bigger pool? Ha-ha. What? So you can push another babysitter in? I'm never going to be able to live that down, am I? Nope. Huh. What? What's wrong? Ah... I just can't put my finger on it. I just feel like something is missing from this campaign. Nah, Sally's great. She's gonna knock their socks off. What, what's so funny? Oh, that's just a phrase your father used the other night. How did Sally get so good at skateboarding? Oh, geez, I mean, she started with your dad when she was four. Did you ever go out with her? Who me? No. I never learned. Um, your father tried to teach me when we were dating and I thought I was gonna break my neck. Dad skated when he was a kid? What, are you kidding? I mean, your father lived for skateboarding, that's why he started this company. I guess I never thought of him being involved in any other way than the business. Well, maybe you should go talk to him. You know, I'm sure he would love to share that with you. Yeah, maybe. Do you mind if I go mess around on the half pipe? Be my guest, I have to finish proofing these, anyway. Is this leftover quinoa? Mmm-hmm. Yeah, you said you liked it. I did say that, I love it, thank you. Does Tommy want some? Oh, no, he already ate. I made him a sandwich earlier. Mmm. Sandwich. Hey, how'd the meeting go this morning? Good, good, the factory said they can triple the units as soon as we give them the word. That's great. Did Tommy come and talk to you earlier today? No, what's up? He just asked me how Sally got so good at skateboarding, so I told him to come talk to you. Really? Yeah, tell him that's fine. Well, if he does, will you please just make some time for him? Of course. Hi, yeah, the pepperoni pizza I ordered for the Modern Skate offices, yeah, I just wanted to remind you to, when you get here, call my cell phone, not the main line. Okay. Oh, yeah, just five minutes? Great, thank you. Hey, Tommy, what's up? Sorry to bother you on the phone. No worries, nothing important. How's everything going for the campaign? Great, really great. Gonna launch us into the stratosphere. I was looking at the Mark IV with Jerome, it looks really cool. Yeah, he's doing some next level stuff over there. I cannot wait to try it out when it's available. Really? Yeah? Uh... I mean, I'm sure he can lend you a board, a prototype, if you're interested. Well, you know, I'm okay with my board. Old reliable, you know? Let me see it. All right, here you go. Yeah, it's a good board. Solid construction... Wait, is this Sally's old Mark II? It sure is, yeah. Yeah, this is a good board. Think she did her first 50-50 on it. Man, would I love to unlock some of that magic. Well, you know, it's not about the board, it's all in the shoes. Oh, really? No, no, I'm just kidding. It's all in the rider, I mean, you just gotta put the time in. You wanna practice a little? - That'd be awesome! - Tonight? Oh, man, really? You sure you aren't too busy? I'm never too busy for you, buddy. Yeah, we'll hit the skate park by the house. Thanks, Dad. Sure. Yeah, I've got a few more hours of work here to finish up, and then we'll go. Nice. This came for you. Uh, me? I didn't... I didn't order a pizza. Oh, that's funny because it's got your name on it. Well, I gotta go. Thanks again, Dad. I'm taking him to the skate park tonight. Oh, good, I'm glad you're doing one thing I ask of you. I love you, and your quinoa-meanwa. But it's not pizza. Oh, there you are. I'm just glad all this stuff still fits. It's been a while. All right, here goes nothing. That was pretty good. Well, thanks, I don't know how I missed that one, I used to do those in my sleep. I'd score it an 8.6. Okay, your turn, Tommy. I'd give it a... 2.1. Okay, pretty good. I didn't fall, that's an improvement. He's self-taught. I'm changing my score to a five-even. It's fine, these things take time. Say I didn't have time. What do you mean? Say I didn't have until... I don't know... Friday? What happens Friday? Nothing, nothing is happening on Friday. Nothing good. But say, hypothetically, I had to learn a trick by Friday, where would you start? Okay. Uh... How's your ollie? Let's say, hypothetically, that I can't do one. Okay, we have our work cut out for us. Let's head down here. Okay, so when you're ready to jump, you're gonna bend your knees, push down on the back, and then when you jump, that's when you slide your front foot forward, like that, okay? And it should make that sound as you do it... ...just tearing up your shoes, so we have to buy new shoes all the time, okay? When you do that, that's what makes the board kind of come up and level out. All right? Simple, right? Yep. I got four knees to bend. I'll sit this lesson out. All right, you got this. - Okay, so I bend the knees... - Yes. - Back... - Yep. - Slide up... - Yep. When you're jumping, you tear up your shoes, just like I taught you. Okay. Did Sally learn this way? Oh, yeah, I mean, I think we were skating together since she was like, four, I think. She was a quick learner? She was, uh, she took to a board like a duck to water. And, you know, I was skating more then, too, I had more time... I don't know, I think by the time you were old enough, she was so advanced, and I was busy with the company and... It's cool, this is fun now. - Yeah, right? - Oh, yeah. You know what, let's... Wanna try another one? I'll be your human safety net. All right, whoa. Got it. - All right, ready? - Yep. Bend your knees, and three, two, one, pop! - All right! - I didn't fall! No, but you got the baby ollie. - All right, let's go for a toddler ollie. - Okay. Three, two, one, pop! Okay, might've been another baby, but three years old maybe, I don't know what toddlers are. - Okay, we're good though. - I didn't fall, so... We're making progress, we're both still alive. Thanks for coaching me today, Dad. No problem. I don't know if you'll be ready for anything on Friday, hypothetically, but you're definitely better now than you were even a few hours ago. Hey, Tommy. Hey, Mr. Schooner. - Hey, Alice, nice to see you. - You, too. You guys skate around a bit? Yeah, he was just teaching me a few moves for... you know, Friday. - Oh. Okay, okay! - Yeah. Oh. Oh, cool. Yeah, actually turns out he's got some pretty sweet moves. Okay, all right, I'm gonna go home, it's my night to cook dinner. Uh, you'll be there soon? Yeah. Okay, Alice, you guys have fun. So... still up for that skate-off? Gotta. I mean, my reputation's on the line. Plus, my dad taught me a bunch today, and with Sally's help on Thursday, I think I'll be able to hold my own. If you say so. You wanna practice some more? No. You brought the camera, right? - Oh, yeah. Okay. - Let's shoot around a little. Alice, is the camera rolling? Rolling. All right. Okay, I just need better than an 8.6 and I take home the gold. Hey, Scooter. Hey, Frankie. Your dog skates, too? Man, is there anyone in your family who can't skate, other than you? Nice one, Frankie. Listen, why don't we do this right now, and get it over with? Really? Psych! No way I'm letting you off that easy. I'm gonna make you look silly in front of the biggest crowd possible. Hey, Frankie, you mind getting out of my shot? Your big head's getting in the way. I'm done wasting my time with you nerds, anyway. Laters. Thanks, Alice. Camera still rolling? Rolling. All right, ready, and three, two, action! Coming in for my close-up. 9.1. Buddy takes home the gold! Buddy! Buddy! Buddy! Good job, Buddy! Come on, Frankie! Sally's never gonna respect moves like that. You're a pro, yes, you are. Good job, Buddy, good job. Okay, let's go, let's go back, boy. Thanks again for dinner, Mr. and Mrs. S. I gave you pure gold to work with, as usual. Nice job, good job, Buddy. You're welcome. Wait a minute, replay that. Come on, Frankie. Sally's never gonna respect moves like that. - Oh! - Did he just say "Sally"? Looks like someone's got a little crush. Ugh! Gross, no way. This is too good. We can't use this, right? Not unless you wanna make him the laughing stock of the entire school. So tempting. Wait. Come on, Frankie. You guys mind keeping it down? I had a tough day riding. Same thing we did at the park, yep. Great. Modern Skate. All right, ready? Yes! So, what do you think? Whoa. Mom, these look awesome. Aw. Thanks. I think the printer did a pretty good job. You've got a great eye, though. The image, like, really pops. Aw. That's so sweet. So, how is skateboard training coming along? Okay, yeah, Dad's a good teacher. And you were right, he's a pretty baller skateboarder still. I don't doubt that. So, why the sudden interest in skateboarding? Oh, no reason, I just really... What in the world? Welcome home, Sal. Oh! So good to see you! Oh, good, you came. I was trying to tell you, Sally's here! - You got in early. - Yeah, about an hour or so. - Luckily, the driver was already there. - Oh, good. Hey, monkey, good to see you. Hey. Welcome back. Okay, well, gang, in honor of my lovely daughter, and the face of our company, returning home from her... 13? Fifteen. Fifteen-country tour, what do you say we take the rest of the afternoon off? Yeah! Billy, wanna get us some pizzas? Okay. Put it on the company card. So, which was your favorite country? - Uh, either Italy or England. - Nice. Italy was just gorgeous, and we didn't have great weather in England, but London was super cool. Nice. How was the end of the school year? Uh, it was okay. One B, the rest were As. Mark Jacobson got his bike stolen. And then someone let a frog loose in the girls' locker room, so... Was it you? No, I did convince one of the teachers to play a movie for three straight classes for "cultural purposes." So Dad told me yesterday that you guys were skateboarding? Yeah, he was just teaching me a few moves. What brought that on? Well, I've been trying a little, since you left. You could tell, he was bummed when you were gone, so... Aw. That's really sweet of you. Shut up. Ugh. And then I went and did something pretty stupid. Uh-oh. So I was mad at Dad 'cause he made me have a babysitter, and for some other things, and then I ran into Frankie, like, literally, ran into Frankie, on the street. - Frankie from the skate park? - Yes. Always hung around with Stewart and Worm? Yeah, that Frankie. And he said some things, that like, normally doesn't bug me, but I just let it get to me, and I challenged him to a skate-off... tomorrow. Oh, monkey. You were always good at getting yourself into trouble. And you were always good at getting me out of trouble, so... There you are, I want you to meet the sales team, they're gonna be a big part of the meeting tomorrow. Talk later. Hey, buddy, it's okay, your dad's just really excited for this meeting. It's fine, I get it. Mike, here's the one who decided to use the softer metal on the trucks. Too much excitement today. I think I overdid it. But it hasn't been a problem, right? Well, she's been on cement parks, pre-fab, kind of traditional parks as well, and no real issues. ...designs and color wise, I mean... She's all about purples... What is it, Tommy? I think Mr. Hoffman is here. What? Okay. Uh, Mr. Hoffman... My goodness... George, it's a pleasure to finally meet you in person. Good to finally meet you, too, Mr. Hoffman. You're here early. Yeah, I tried to tell you that the other day on the phone, but we got disconnected. Anyway, I thought I'd come by and introduce myself before our meeting tomorrow. I hope that didn't cause any inconvenience. No, not at all. We're just taking a little break because my daughter came in early as well. Hi, Mr. Hoffman, I'm Sally Schooner. I've heard so much about you. That's good. She actually just got back from a world tour, she's been skating... Oh, yes, I am very well aware of Sally and her skateboarding accomplishments. Ah. Well, great, I'm sure you'll learn even more tomorrow when you see the great ad campaign that our marketing team has been working on. Mr. Hoffman, Mary Schooner, head of marketing here at Modern Skate. And yet another Schooner, it's a pleasure to meet you. You truly have a family company here. Yes, very much so. And please come in, we got pizza coming. Oh, no, thank you. I appreciate that, but we're gonna go. We do look forward to seeing what you're going to be presenting us in the morning. Good evening. Thank you, Mr. Hoffman. Schooner family. Thank you. Did that feel like... Tomorrow's gonna be a total disaster? He seemed much more pleasant on the phone. Yeah. Who wants pizza? Ooh! I'll have a slice. I'm sorry. So let me get this straight. You challenged Frankie, who's probably been skateboarding since he was seven, to a skate-off tomorrow, and you've kind of been skating, for what, three months? I'd say like 80/20, like... skating to goofing off. But I envision myself pulling, like, this sweet move that nobody's seen before. That's helpful, right? What's the trick? I don't know, I'm not an expert at this stuff. You're ridiculous. Is Vancouver out of the question? What? It's a little town in Canada. They make a lot of movies there. Some say it looks like New York, but I can always tell. Never mind. I've just been working really hard this past week, and wondering if you could give me a few, like, last minute pointers? Tommy, it takes more than a week to get good at anything, let alone skateboarding. I don't think my scale goes high enough for that. Maybe a 12? Fifteen? You think I could learn how to do any part of what I just did in a week? That sequence alone took months of practice for each part, based on years of effort to master the most basic skills. So I'm doomed. Vancouver it is. I'll pack a bag... Of what, I don't quite know. I didn't say that. I just think you need to set realistic goals for yourself, and appreciate how much work goes into things. You think I could get as good as you are with one of these in just a week? I've seen you and Alice running around with the camera every day since Dad got his for Christmas three years ago. Not to mention all the time you spend watching movies in your room. I've seen like ten movies in my life, and they're all rom-coms. Not true. I made you watch Cowboys vs Dinosaurs. Classic. And it was very good. All I'm saying is, these things take time. But I don't have time. I'm gonna embarrass myself if I don't do something tomorrow. Well, let's see what you've got. I hear Vancouver is lovely this time of year. Seventy-eight and sunny yesterday. You're like the best skater in the world, isn't there a piece of magical advice you can give me? All I can suggest is, do your best. Whatever you're best at, do it the best you can. Whatever you're worst at, do that to the best of your abilities, as well. Eight grade is gonna be rough. Hopefully, everyone has a great summer and they'll forget about tomorrow. I'm sure some dance craze viral video will bump you down to the number three spot this summer. Let's get home. You've definitely got the riding straight and stopping thing down. Thanks, but even Buddy can do that. What exactly is that supposed to mean? Please don't tell Mom and Dad about this stupid bet, I don't want them to know how much of an idiot I was about it. All good, mum's the word. Besides, I think they're still a little stressed over the meeting tomorrow. It's fine, right? I mean, tell me it's gonna be fine, because maybe they were just tired from traveling all day, right? I mean, I hope so, because they basically walked into a pizza party. I mean, they think they're coming to a place of business, and there we all are, 4:00 p.m. on a Thursday, just relaxing, about to chow down on some pizza, and then, I ask them if they wanna stay? I mean, we don't even know if they like pizza, they're from LA! Yes, George, I'm sure they like pizza, everyone likes pizza. Okay, that's true, good point, everyone likes pizza. So, yeah, they're probably just tired, it's what, a seven-hour flight from LA? Hon, will you relax? Take a seat. I have been going over all the boards for the presentation, and you know this material cold. And if they pass, then I'm perfectly content with the pool size we have. I'm sorry. Sally, what was your read on Mr. Hoffman? I thought he was nice. Quiet but he was probably tired. Tired. Yeah, right, see? I'm just overreacting. Oh, here's an idea, have you guys ever thought about trying to... Mary, can I take a look at your tablet? I wanna review the earnings reports. Maybe if we can't wow them with the campaign, we can do it with the numbers. Tommy, I'm sorry. What were you saying? It's fine, it doesn't matter. Hey, Tommy. Just do your best. Thanks, and thanks for going to the skate park with me. Ah-ha! There's a mistake in the numbers. Ah, there's a mistake in the numbers. I told Steve to double check all these reports, and... Oh, no, no, no. These reports are perfect. Is everything gonna be all right? Dad's really stressing. This pitch meeting is really important, and Dad just found out that Sheckler Boards just signed a huge deal with a Chinese company. If we can't compete, we could lose the business. I don't want you to worry, you're gonna be great. I just hope that we have what Mr. Hoffman wants, and if we don't, we don't. All right? And we're gonna figure something out. - Okay? - Yeah. We spend how much every year on staplers? Oh. I need to rein your father in. Okay, Mr. Hoffman, esteemed colleagues, we want to extend our warmest thanks to you for traveling so far to meet with us today... Um, it's too much, though, right, it's too formal? I had this perfect, it was perfect, and now I can't remember how I started it. I just think that we need to get some sleep. You are going to nail this presentation tomorrow. This deal is dead if it doesn't go well tomorrow. George, I am well aware. We have both put months of work into this, and a few extra hours tonight isn't going to save it. Okay? It's just going to make us both tired and unable to focus. Okay, okay, you're right. Thank you. Sorry. Good night. If it goes well, we could... there could be a Modern Skate park downtown. George... sleep. Did you like "esteemed colleagues" because I could say "honored colleagues..." George... - I'm just saying it's an easy switch. - Sleep. Sleep. Okay. - But you feel good about it, right? - George, oh, my goodness! I love you. - I love you, too. - Thanks for loving me. I know it's hard. Mom? Sally? Dad? Ahh! Mrs. Crowley. What are you doing here? Mmm. I dropped the blacklist a few days early. Your father sounded desperate on the phone. And he promised to make me some saffron risotto. Hello? Hello, Mom. Why is Mrs. Crowley here? Your father thought it was gonna be best for you to stay home. He just wasn't sure how Mr. Hoffman would feel with a kid running around at the meeting. But I thought I was going with you guys today. Tommy, I'm sorry. I... Maybe you can stop by after the meeting, okay? I'm sorry, I have to go. No, no, no... That's too late. I'm toast. Toast? No, that smells more like creamed wheat. I don't think she's looking. Okay, come on, let's go. Hey, Tommy! Hey, Buddy! Good morning, Alice. Always a pleasure. You ready for this? As I'll ever be. All right, what tricks are you gonna do? Did Sal give you pointers last night? I don't know, I don't have any tricks. Look, you gotta have something. - Wait, not even an ollie-to-manual? - No. It's pretty simple, here, let me show you how to do it. Alice! I don't want you to show me! I suck at skateboarding. I get it, and everyone else is better at it than I am. Well, I didn't mean it like that. It's fine, okay? This is my problem, and I need to deal with it myself. Fine, you wanna be by yourself so bad, then be my guest. Alice, I'm sorry, I... You know, I think I'm gonna ride on ahead myself. I'll see you there, Tommy. You, too? Buddy? How cute. Looks like the whole pack is here except the leader. Excuse me? I'm sorry, Alice. I didn't mean to... Hey, I'm a lone wolf, and you better watch yourself. Let's get this over with. Agreed. Hey, George. Mr. Hoffman's here. Okay. Mr. Hoffman, esteemed colleagues, friends... Scooter! I'm glad you could make it. For a minute there, I thought you weren't gonna show, but from what I've seen, that may have been the wiser choice. Let's just get this over with. What's that? I don't think they heard you. I said, let's just get this over with. Oh. We're just getting started. On Monday, I was riding down the street, minding my own business, when Tommy Schooner here, in a hurry to get somewhere, bowled me over. I never seen him coming, but seeing how much of a skilled skater he is, he had to see me. He said to me... Get out of my way, you little pip-squeak. "Get out of my way, you pip-squeak." I never said that. Quiet, I'm telling a story. So there I was, afraid of what this big bully... ...of a kid was gonna do to me. Was he gonna take my lunch money? There wasn't school on Monday. Why would you have lunch money? Was he gonna take my beloved skateboard? What would I do with two skateboards? Or was he just gonna beat me up and leave me on the side of the street? Not to mention, my dad owns a skateboarding company. I really have no use for your board. You're really hung up on that point, aren't you? Yeah, yeah, kind of. No, instead, he said... I'm gonna humiliate you in front of everybody. ...this Friday, at the skate-off. Wow, I really remember those events happening differently. Hope I'm not sleepwalking again. Mr. Hoffman, esteemed friends, welcome, again, to Modern Skate. So here we are. Today's the day. The gauntlet was thrown, the challenge was accepted. I feel like I represent all little guys when I say, enough is enough, and stand up to this bully. I'm vastly outmatched by his superior skill, but I can only hope that... Just go on with it already! Right, yeah. Sorry. Grip or graphic? Grip. Grip it is. You wanna go first or second? Uh, you can go first. My "superior" skills can wait just a little bit longer. Okay, video is one thing, but let's see how it compares to the real deal. Now as you can see, Sally is riding on the new Talon Mark IV. Now this model isn't even out yet, but I can assure you, it's going to blow the Mark III numbers out of the water. Now, our chief engineer, Jerome Walker, can explain the improvements we've made. Right on, thank you, George. Sure, and in English, please. The Mark IV uses a new polycarbon synthetic in the board which increases the tensile strength and decreases the mass by an order of 25. But... In other words, we've made our boards stronger and lighter. We've also increased the coeffic... The slipperiness of the bearings, making this the smoothest gliding board that has ever been made. It's like... It's like you're riding on a cloud. - George. - Thanks, Jerome. And we've already spoken with our manufacturers, and they're ready to increase output to match demand. Any questions? Rules are as follows: each person has 30 seconds to complete as many tricks as possible. When finished, our panel of judges will hold up their scores. The highest score wins. Good luck. You're gonna need it. Thanks. You, too, Frankie. Start the clock! You can have the rest of my time, Tommy. I don't think I'm gonna need it. I give the rest of my time to my opponent. What's the score? I'd give it a six. Six and a half. A 9.1? What routine were you watching? All right, Tommy, give him what he deserves. So what's it gonna be, Tommy? I hope your sister gave you some good advice. She did, actually, and she said to do what I do best. Oh! I can't watch. And what I do best... isn't skateboarding, and I stand no chance beating you. What I do best... is this. Come on, Frankie! Sally's never gonna respect moves like that. That's what I do best. And if you don't stop bullying these kids in this neighborhood, I'm gonna make sure everyone in our school sees that video. And everybody knows that I'm not a great skater, and I realize I have nothing to lose, but you just proved how great of a skateboarder you are, and when this video comes out, and that cute little "eek" sound you make... Well, the bigger they are, the harder they fall. Look, Tommy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. Really? Yeah, I mean, your family is super cool. Your dad makes skateboards, that's awesome. And your sister... Wait, you do have a crush on my sister. What? No. Ugh! Gross, you do! - Ugh! - Shut up, man! Man, it's cool. Just be a little nicer to me, and I'll put in a few good words. Come on, is someone gonna skate? I've got stuff to do! Hey, man, I'm sorry about everything and here... I yield the rest of my time. Phew. A 2.0? What competition were you watching? Right? Let me know when the guy starts judging dog shows, I'm in. I officially declare Frankie, winner of today's skate-off. Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! So that's who we are as a company, and we hope that you'll see us as a valuable investment, and agree to partner with us as we go to the next level, together. Mr. Schooner, um... thank you very much for the presentation, and for your hospitality. Uh... Unfortunately, I cannot invest in your company. Oh, uh... Do you mind if I ask why? Quite simply... there's just nothing special about it. I mean, you have a lovely family, and your product seems to be very good, and your daughter is exceptionally talented, but I've seen this all before. I was really hoping to witness something unique here today. I understand. Uh, would you at least stay for lunch? It'll be ready soon, and we've got so much food. I appreciate the offer. Uh... Sure. We can stay for lunch. Okay, great, lunch it is. You lost. I know, the skate-off at least. And hopefully, not a friend. I was being a jerk back there, and I was stressed, and I knew you were trying to help, but took my stress out on you, and I've just gotta stop doing that. We cool? I left my 50-millimeter lens at your house, so... I guess we're cool. Any news from Sally on the presentation? Oh. Yeah, let me check. Oh, man. It's not going good. I knew I should've gone to the meeting, my talents are wasted here. That's not good, what was wrong? They wanted something unique. How about a skateboard wrapped in bacon? Bet you've never seen one of those before. Come on! Where are we going? Modern headquarters! I have an idea! What's your idea? I'm gonna give them something "unique." Whoa, wait! Stop! That was awesome! You are getting better. I give that a 20! Paws down! Maybe I should've tried a move back there, against Frankie, huh? Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay? Oh. We gotta get to Modern. George, you know what, we actually misjudged the time, we have to get to another meeting. Oh, are you sure? It's just gonna be a few minutes. No, no, it's fine. When we get there, we gotta assess the situation, okay? We can't just be two kids and a dog barging into an important meeting. You got it, chief! Alice, I'm gonna need your help with the TV. That smell. It's... It's incredible! Sorry, Tommy, no time to waste! Buddy, wait! - We do have to go, thank you, though. - Okay. - Appreciate it. - Thank you, Mr. Hoffman, thank you for your time. Of course. Buddy! Oh! - Uh... We're very sorry. - So sorry! Uh, we are sorry. Alice? Oh. Sorry about the mess. I'm Tommy Schooner, I'm head of special marketing projects, and I'm sure you've already met Buddy Schooner, the other face of Modern Skate. Pleasure! You wanted something unique, and I give you, Buddy and Sally, the family skateboarding human-dog team. We're still work-shopping the name. Now that... is something unique. A skateboarding dog? It's brilliant. Mr. Schooner... I'm gonna invest in your company. - Really? - Yeah, really. Congratulations. - Thank you, Mr. Hoffman, thank you. - Thank you so much. Sorry about your face. Thanks. Thanks, Bill. I do think the food's still okay if we're careful. - No, we're fine. - Or we could just order pizza. We'll order pizza. Bill, can we get some... Put it on the company card. Great job, everybody. Now, less hugging, more eating. Well, it was certainly a pleasure to meet you and your lovely family, Mr. Schooner. Hopefully, one day, you'll get out to Los Angeles so you can meet mine. We'd be happy to. Thanks again for the opportunity. You won't regret it. I know I won't. We're gonna make a lot of money together. Great. Come on, honey, let's show Mr. Hoffman out. Sounds good. Gentlemen. Tommy Schooner, I owe you an apology. I never knew you had such a talent for filmmaking. Thanks, and it's okay. No. It was easy for me to connect with your sister because we both like the same things. But I should've spent more time getting to know you and your interests, not just going to the skate park with you because you started being interested in mine. Thanks, Dad, and I know you've had a lot on your plate. No, that's no excuse, you're my son. I love you and I've always got time for you. Plus, that video is amazing! You have more of those? Well, Alice and I did make a short film about a ghost in our basement. Oh, what's it called? The Ghost in the Basement. Of course it is, all right. What did we know? We were ten. Okay, I'll tell you what. When we get home tonight, we'll watch The Ghost in the Basement. And then if you want, spend the summer here, making videos for the campaign. You gave yourself a title, the least I can do is give you a desk. - Sound good? - Sounds great! Now be honest, do you like the quinoa? Ugh. No, I've been flushing it down the toilet for about a week... Thank you. I see you guys watching me. I'm always in the spotlight. Nice job with the video. Thanks. I hope you don't mind sharing the spotlight with a dog. It's not just any dog. It's the best skateboarding dog in the whole world. Go ahead, shower me with compliments, but I still won't work on weekends. So how'd your skate-off go? Okay. I lost. - There's no surprise there. - Nope. Did you attempt any tricks? No. I did take your advice, and kind of feel bad about it. How so? It's wrong to bully someone, even though you're trying to get him to stop bullying you. Correct. Two wrongs don't make a right. Two wrongs don't make a right, but three lefts do! Do you think you could give me a hand with something? Of course. Thanks. Oh, yeah, I'm shredding! Check it out! Hey, Frankie! Oh. Hey, Scoot... I mean, Schooner. Come to say hi? Yeah, and to apologize. Kind of a bully move I pulled back there, using the video. - We good? - Yeah, we good. Oh, and... someone's here to see you. Huh? Sa... Hey, Frankie. Sally Schooner? It's good to see you again. I heard you won some sort of amateur skate competition today? Yup, I guess I did. Well, I just wanna say congratulations, and give you this. See you around, Frankie. Hey, thanks for your help today. You did a great job pretending to flirt with Frankie. Who said I was pretending? Ugh. Gross, no, Frankie? What? He's kind of cute. Ugh. I can't, I'm gonna be sick. You coming, dear? We're about to watch Ghost in the Basement. In the basement. I'm coming, I'm coming. All right, who wants popcorn? Uh, I think everybody. So, Tommy, how long is this movie? It's about... four hours. Okay, wow. No. He's kidding, it's like 12 minutes. Thank goodness, because I did not make enough popcorn for that. All right, I guess it's time to hit it on Ghost in the Basement. And... Action! And cut! Nice. All right, that work for you guys? - Yeah, great. - Yeah, that works for us. Then that's the last shot before lunch. - Good! - Great! Hey, Sally, Buddy, why don't you guys come over here? I wanna get a nice group photo of all of us for the website. Good idea, Ma Schooner. Let's make sure the Modern banner's in the picture. There we go... all right. Hold the phone. Do I smell... Oh, my gosh. That smells like... Oh, it can't be. Oh, it is! Oh, my gosh, it's steak! Oh, come on, guys, I'm being good, take the picture. Hurry up, I'm so hungry! Oh, man, I can't wait! - Take the picture. - Come on, guys, I'm being good. I'm a good boy! Please welcome Tony Hawk! - Hey, what's up, George? - Hey, man. - Good to see you! - You, too. Thanks for coming out. Congrats on taking Modern Skate global, that's huge. Yeah, dude, well, we couldn't have done it without you. - Seriously, thanks, man. - See you, man. Yeah, get back to your stuff. Oh, man. I just had the craziest dream. Wouldn't it be cool if I could snowboard? Subtitles by explosiveskull
