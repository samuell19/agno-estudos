[in Taglish] Actually, that's only Binondo. But this is how the first restaurant [in Tagalog] of my grandparents looked like in China [in Taglish] before they migrated to the Philippines. [lively upbeat music playing] [Charity in Hokkien] Happy Chinese New Year! [Charity in Tagalog] Just like Grandma, I also love to cook. Grandma. Mm. [in Hokkien] [in English] Sorry, Grandma. [Charity grunts] [in Hokkien] [Charity in Taglish] The problem is, cooking doesn't like me. [Ama groans] [in Hokkien] [in Taglish] The problem with you is, you're too serious when you are cooking. [in Hokkien] [in Taglish] I feel like quitting culinary school. [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] Mm. [in Hokkien] Mm! [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] Grandma. [giggles] [Charity] I am allergic to talking about having a boyfriend. Because Grandma can't wait to see me get married. She always sets me up with anyone on a blind date. And of course, all of them are Chinese. Because Chinese people believe, Chinese are meant for Chinese only. This is delicious. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Because I enjoy watching you eating. [Charity] But no matter how lousy the dates turned out, that didn't stop my grandma from setting me up to see anyone. [upbeat party music playing] [Charity] Mom believes in love at first sight. All it takes is one look for you to know if the man before you is truly meant for you. [in Taglish] And definitely, it's not him. [in Hokkien] [Charity in Tagalog] Sigh, I give up already! [in English] Until one day, [in Taglish] my ideal guy came. [in English] He's the one! [in Taglish] I've finally met my soulmate. He's nice, a gentleman, and 100% Chinese. So this is your culinary school. [in English] So, where'd you wanna go? [in Tagalog] It's up to you, I'll just change clothes. [in Taglish] All right, go ahead. [comic music playing] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Get in. Come [in Hokkien] [in English] Charity, I want you to meet my mom. Hello. [in Taglish] I'm always with my mom, I hope you don't mind. [Charity] Oh, no, he's a mama's boy. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Do you want to have fun and drink? -I'm game! -[chuckles] [in Hokkien] [Charity in English] Right then and there, [in Tagalog] I promised I wouldn't date anyone anymore, ever. [in English] Chinese or otherwise. [in Taglish] Besides, love at first sight isn't real! [calm music playing] -[man in Tagalog] Hey, Nathan! -Yes? Mrs. Go was looking for you. She was panicking. [man] You and Kate look after the store. [woman] That's right, attend to her already. -Thanks, you're here. -What happened? [in Taglish] Please help me, my dog. My dog isn't barking. -Huh? -[Mrs. Go moaning] [in Tagalog] Maybe you scolded him? Didn't you tell me your dog is sensitive? How could I not scold him? He ate my Valium. What? Oh, no! -Oh my. Let's bring him inside. -[Mrs. Go] Baby… [birds chirping] [girl] But mom, I liked the Chihuahua more. [woman 2] Okay, tell it to your dad. Ma'am, isn't he cute? I know. But mom is allergic to dogs. Ma'am, not that. Over there. [light music playing] [sneezes] Whoa! It's so dusty here. Come on, let's go over here. Are we leaving already? Why? Who was that? My girlfriend. You're so cheeky! How come she's your girlfriend? She just looked at you. What's wrong with that? That's what I'm feeling. You know what? -I'll find her and court her. -[scoffs] And by the way, where in the world do you see an assistant who hits his boss who's a doctor? A dog doctor, you mean. And Nathan, we just studied at the same time. -And I'm smarter than you. -[scoffs] My mom just ran out of money that's why I couldn't finish school. So don't rub it in my face that you're a doctor. Hmph! -Okay, okay. -Hey, hey! Both of you, I need help! There are a lot of customers inside. [in Taglish] Sorry, doc. It's his fault. -Why are you calling him "doc" but not me? -[scoffs] [in Tagalog] Are you flirting with Kate? Bro, what are you talking about? She's like my sister. -And I won't even try. I have taste. -Taste? A playboy like yourself doesn't require taste to hit on anyone. -[Johnny] Let's go. -Hey! I'm not a playboy. [in Taglish] You're a playboy. You're also a… You're also the quiet type. You look harmless. But also a heartbreaker. That's true, Master Lee. You know what? This month, he broke up with a girl three times. You think he's the silent type, but he's a lady killer. Stop that. You have to be careful, if you don't want what happened before to happen again. Happened before? [Master Lee] You had a lot of wives before. One wife after another every week. [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [choking] [in Hokkien] [women giggling] [in English] What? [in Taglish] So you were Chinese in your past life? Chinese and playboy. You had a lot of girls but no happiness. Too much negative energy. Too much bad luck. [in Tagalog] It may get back to you. Get back at me, how? Maybe, the time you find your true love. You may lose her. [Mrs. Go] Nathan. [sobs] Good thing you came. I thought you wouldn't make it. [Mrs. Go] You know what? When my baby was still alive… [cries] …he was such a good boy. [wails] Mrs. Go? Wasn't that Washington? Your dog? If you look at him, he seems like he's just sleeping. [Johnny chuckling quietly] Mrs. Go, please give me a minute. [Mrs. Go] Baby. Hey! Where are you going? We thought it was a child, but it's a dog! [laughs] [calm music playing] [Johnny continues laughing] Just a minute. Would you like to share my umbrella? [Charity in English] Once upon a time in China. [in Tagalog] Actually, that's only Binondo. I met somebody and Mom was right. Love at first sight is real. [upbeat whimsical music playing] Nathan, I need to tell you something. My family isn't really from Bacolod. [in English] Okay… So… [in Tagalog] What are we doing here? Um… this… this restaurant is owned by my grandparents. It's where I train. Sit down. Um, my grandma wants me to manage the place in the future. But if you ask dad, he wanted me to manage the real estate business. Um… I bought you here because I want you to meet my family. They're here? No, they're not here. Um, but if… you see them in person… I have to prepare you. Prepare? For what? For them. [Charity] That's my mom. She's louder than a rooster in the morning. [both yelling] Why are you shouting? -It's because-- -You're hurting my ears! It's because it is scary, ma'am. What's so scary? Don't you play with me. This is from Doctor Belo. This is expensive. So that I stay beautiful. This fish that you bought. -Is that fresh? -[all] Yes, ma'am, it's fresh. If it's stale, all of you are fired! Whoo! [Charity] But for how loud my mom can be, that's how quiet dad is. Pa? [Charity] That's my older brother Emerson. He's kind of weird. [in Hokkien] [in English] Are you sure? It's just that… [in Taglish] I just couldn't decide if I'll use a rope or… [stammering] electrical… cord. [in Hokkien] [in Taglish] Depends on your mood. I don't know, Pa. [in Hokkien] [giggling] [in English] Thanks, Pa! [Emerson] Nice idea. Good morning, Emerson. [in Taglish] According to my calendar… [in Hokkien] [in English] [stammering] Don't worry, Mom. [in Taglish] I'll just be in my room. [in Hokkien] [in English] Good. Huh? [in Hokkien] [Yolanda in Tagalog] Give that to me. Give it to me! Williamson! Williamson! [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] Williamson! [in Hokkien] Mm. Ah! [in Hokkien] [Charity in Tagalog] I have a brother who's weird, and another with a defect, too. Until now, he and Caroline couldn't make a child. [Anderson] Are we going to this every after we made love? [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [all exclaim in surprise] [in Tagalog] What's that noise I heard? [Anderson and Caroline laughing] [Anderson] Mom, why are you here? [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Why didn't you close the door? [Anderson and Caroline giggling] You are giving me a headache! [in Hokkien] [Charity in English] I swear. [in Tagalog] There's no day this family doesn't deal with drama. Good thing Grandma and Grandpa are around. Or else I would have lost my sanity a long time ago. [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [Ama in Mandarin] [Ang Kong in Mandarin] [Ama laughing] [in Tagalog] And that is my family. Hey! Why aren't you saying anything? I just don't understand. We've been in a relationship for a year now. Why are you telling me all this just now? It's hard to explain. [Charity] Since you're not Chinese, you wouldn't even understand. Try me. Nathan, I'm 100% Chinese. [Charity] Me and my family. We have a tradition. And based on this tradition, I should've not fallen in love with you. [Charity] This relationship? This should've not come to the point where I need to present you to my family. But I'm introducing you, Nathan. Because I am certain about you. [Charity] No matter what they say. [calm music playing] [Kate] If you were to ask me Filipinos don't stand a chance with the pure Chinese. Their relationship doesn't last. There are a lot of girls just waiting out there. Can you give me some adobo? -Try the prawns, I brought those. -Bro, I'm allergic to prawns, ain't I? [man singing in English on the radio] ♪ So you'll always remember ♪ [in Tagalog] There's that song again! -Who is that? I could hear him everywhere. -He's Felix Yan of the Asian Idol. He's famous and very handsome. -He's great! He's actually my favorite. -Is he good? Really? -Oh really? -Yes, of course. [music continues] [Felix singing] ♪ I know it's been said ♪ ♪ Many times, many ways ♪ [in Mandarin] [in English] Thanks. [in Mandarin] [in Mandarin] [in Mandarin] [in Tagalog] What do you think, Susie? Do I look good? They're obviously blind if they don't find you handsome. [chuckles] Look! Chichi. Big brother is very handsome. [breathes deeply] [Nathan's mom] Susie! Leave those mice alone. They aren't mice, they're hamsters. They're just the same. Mom? You look great. Son, are you sure you don't want to wear anything red? They say that the color red is lucky for Chinese. Mom, the color red is for the Chinese New Year only. And besides, even the Chinese think that red is unfashionable. -Is that so? -Yes. -Anyway, you look good on that too. -Thanks, mom. -[Nathan] Hey, dad! Mano po. -Here's your gift. It's a Zen fountain. My friend said, water is lucky for the Chinese. Look! Chichi. Big brother even prepared a gift. Susie, leave those mice for now. Wash your hands, we'll have dinner soon. Yes, Mom. [crickets chirping] [comical music playing] [knocks] [in Taglish] Good evening. [in Tagalog] Charity? What are you doing here? -Wasn't I supposed to pick you up? -I felt uneasy, so I just came here. Why don't you have dinner here? I cooked bistek tagalog, and lumpiang shanghai. Let's go! -[Budong in English] Good evening, ma'am. -[in Tagalog] What? You have a security guard at home? I'm so nervous and you're still joking around! -I was not joking. -Come on now. It's my first time seeing a house with a guard. Wait. Just a few reminders. My grandma prepared all the food. So she'll appreciate it if you eat everything she serves you. You know me. Since when have I had a problem eating everything served to me? [food sizzling] [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Ma, how could Charity do this to me? Don't blame Charity. It's not her fault. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] It's okay to fall in love. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] If you don't like the boy, then why are you cooking? [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] I cooked so Charity can see that I'm suffering. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Now I have wrinkles. My Botox is wasted. [light music playing] [Charity] Nathan. My older brother Anderson and his wife Caroline. [in English] Well, hello. [in Tagalog] Nice to finally meet the boyfriend of our youngest sibling. I was looking at your family pictures, is this you and Charity? That's Timothy and Charity at their ballet recital. [Anderson] Their marriage was arranged when they were kids. Because their zodiac signs were compatible and his family was rich. [giggles] Grandpa! Come. [Charity] Grandma. Grandpa. Nathan, meet my grandparents. [in Hokkien] Oh. [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Hey, Emerson! [stammering] Are you Charity's non-Chinese boyfriend? Emerson! Mama, ma! -[Yolanda] Emerson. -Charity's non-Chinese boyfriend is here. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Nathan, meet my mom and dad. Good evening. [sneezes] Why suddenly the house smells like a dog? [Charity] Uh… I'm sorry. [sniffs] I think that was me. I was in the vet clinic a while ago. By the way, this is for you. Thank you. [Nathan] Please go ahead and open it. It's a Zen fountain for your home. [Yolanda] Thank you. Why is there a hole? You gave me a gift with a hole. [squeaking] [screaming] Mouse! It's a mouse! It's not a mouse. It's a hamster. Mouse! [whispering] Charity, won't your mom poison me because she's furious about me? I'll just go home. [Charity in Taglish] Just relax. I'm here. [claps] [Ang Kong in Tagalog] Eat! [whispering] Why? It's only during funeral wakes Chinese stick up chopsticks on rice. I'm sorry. [Yolanda] This is my specialty, prawns in garlic. [And Kong] I'm already full. Give it to someone else. Just eat. Eat. [Caroline] Emerson. [Anderson] Emerson! It's delicious. Eat! Have some, Williamson. -[Williamson] I'll give it to the visitor. -Okay. Just eat a lot of this. -[Charity] Pa… -It's delicious. My wife cooked it. Nathan, aren't you allergic to… No. I'll be okay. [in English] Sure? [in Tagalog] What is it? You don't want it? -No, ma'am. -Prawns are delicious, right? Yes, ma'am. Are you okay? Mm-hmm. [Nathan retches] -[Charity] Nathan. -[Nathan retching] [Charity] Are you okay? [retches] [Yolanda] What's wrong? [Charity] Nathan! [all shouting] -[Nathan's mom] Hey, come in. -[Charity] Mom. -[Charity] Good evening, dad. -[Nathan's dad] Hey, Charity. -Nathan. -Hmm? You have a visitor. [Nathan moans] Tell them I can't see anyone. [Nathan's dad chuckles] Not even me? Charity? Is that you? Oh, no! Let's just meet next week! Huh? We'll leave you alone. What's wrong with you? [Nathan] Nothing! What are you saying? Nathan, it's me. -I was allergic to the prawn-- -Remove this! [Charity gasps] Uh… I already told you, I don't want to see anyone. I still look ugly. What do you mean by "ugly"? [Charity] Why? Is it ugly if… [snickers] You looked like a grouper fish we usually eat every Chinese New Year. Just go on, insult me. Who says I'm insulting you? For your information, fish are lucky for the Chinese. I came here to thank you because though you're allergic to prawns. You still ate it just to please my mom. [Charity] You know what, when my grandparents were still in China, she was the master chef in their restaurant. That's why my mom is so insecure of her cooking. You mean… Does your mom like me? Of course, she does. [in English] I'm sure, next time, [in Tagalog] you'll get to their good side even more. [in Taglish] Do you mean there's still a "next time"? [Charity] Please talk to me, Mom. [in Hokkien] Hmph. [in Tagalog] What are we going to talk about? [in English] All I want is for you to give Nathan a chance. [in Tagalog] What's so hard to understand, Charity? Nathan isn't Chinese. He's not for you. The Chinese are for the Chinese. It's tradition. It's what we must obey. Just please give Nathan a chance, Ma. [Yolanda] Why did you break up with Timothy? He's Chinese and he's successful. But what did you do? You replaced him with a non-Chinese. And you met each other at a funeral wake. That's bad luck! I didn't replace Timothy. It was just an arranged wedding. And I haven't seen him for too long now. [in English] And as far as I'm concerned… [in Tagalog] …I didn't have any boyfriend to replace. The both of you! You've been married for a long time. You haven't given me a grandchild yet. Wait, Ma. Why include us in your fight? [Charity] Nathan. I don't know! All of you are giving me a headache! -What is he doing here? -I asked him to come here, Ma. [in Hokkien] [in Taglish] Good afternoon, Ma'am. [sneezes] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] -[Charity] Let's stay over here first. -[Nathan] What did she say? [Charity] Mom said it's hot here. So she's staying inside. And she said you've got a pretty shirt, and that it looks good on you. -Really? -Yes. I knew it. Your mom's starting to like me. Why don't we go outside? Okay. [driver] Ma'am, the van won't start. [Yolanda] Huh? Why? I think the battery is dying. [in Taglish] That can't be. I have an appointment with Dr. Belo. She's leaving for a month. What will happen to my face? If you want, I can drive you there. You? Do you have a car? Yes, ma'am. [Anderson] Just go, Mom. Nathan's being nice to you already. It's on you now if you can't get to Dr. Belo's on time. You need a Botox, right? -Okay, fine! Where is your car? -It's right there. Don't worry. All of you can fit. -Here it is. -[Yolanda] Huh? -This is it? This is what we'll ride? -Yes, ma'am. Go on, Mom. So you can experience riding a jeep. It's fast. -Let's go, Mom. Dr. Belo is waiting. -Fine! [Anderson] Let's go, hop in. [Emerson in English] It's too dirty. [Yolanda in Tagalog] I'm feeling dizzy already. -Is there an earthquake? It's wobbling. -[Caroline] Just relax, Mom. All this dust is sticking on my face, my flawless face! -[Emerson] Mom, there's a lot of germs! -[Yolanda] I don't like it here. I'll get a taxi. Taxi! Mom! There, a taxi! Taxi! [Charity] Nathan! -[tires screeching] -[all screaming] Taxi! [Felix in English] Hi. Hey, how are you doin'? [female reporter] You've become a big success after winning Asian Idol. What's next for Felix Yan? Well, we're currently wrapping up our Asian promotional tour. Next stop would be the Philippines. In your latest number one hit, "My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own," you sing with so much emotion. Any inspiration? Someone special? [laughs] [Nathan] Charity. [Charity] Yes? [Nathan in Tagalog] I'm really sorry. I couldn't get things right whenever I'm around your family. [Charity] Stop it, don't think about that. Don't worry. One day, they'll like you. You'll see. [Nathan] Are you always here in your family's resort? [Charity] Um, I'm here often, especially when I'm pressured by my mom. I almost forgot. Oh! [in English] Happy monthsary! [Charity] Thank you. [in Taglish] It says in the internet that the Yin-Yang represents peace and harmony. [in Tagalog] Just like you. [in English] I find peace when I'm with you. And you're my harmony. [in Taglish] The Yin can't exist without the Yang. [in Tagalog] Like me. [in English] I can't exist without you. [Nathan in Tagalog] I think I sounded corny. [Charity] Maybe just a little. Always keep it safe with you. So that wherever you go it's like I'm right beside you. [class in Hokkien] -[teacher in English] Again. -[class repeats in Hokkien] -[in English] Thank you, Do Xia. -[all] Do Xia. When you want to say, I love you, you say Gua Ai Di. Gua Ai Di. -She says Gua Ai Di means I love you. -[teacher] To impress your girlfriend, [in Tagalog] if you want to say she is pretty, [in English] You say… [speaks in Hokkien] -[class repeats in Hokkien] -[teacher] Very good. [in Taglish] Ma'am, how do you say "sister-in-law"? "Sister-in-law" is… [speaks in Hokkien] [all repeating] [in Tagalog] Do you really love Charity? Isn't it obvious? [Nathan] I'll do anything to prove I love her. I would even walk on a tightrope for her. [laughs] [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] What did she say? We were talking about pretty girls, maybe she said that we're both cute. [laughs] [in Hokkien] [in English] Thank you, Ma'am. Um… [in Hokkien] -[sighs] -[Nathan] Do Xia, Ma'am! [in Tagalog] The teachers here are so nice. You said it. -Hey! -Hey, Timothy! -Caroline? Come here. -Yes, Mom. Why? -I came from-- -[Ang Kong] Go away! -I came from a Chinese doctor. -Okay. Drink this. It'll help you get pregnant. It's made from deer antlers. It's very effective. -Okay. -Give me a grandchild, okay? So Grandma and Grandpa will be happy. [Charity in Hokkien] Grandpa! Grandma! Hi. [Nathan in Hokkien] [Yolanda in Tagalog] Huh? Do you speak Hokkien? [Emerson] Ho A Mi. -He's studying. -That's nice! [in Hokkien] [both] Oh! [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [Charity] Uh… Ma. [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [all snickering] [in Hokkien] Um… [in Hokkien] [all laughing] [in Hokkien] Charity. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Wait, Ma. Why are you watching videos of me and Timothy from when we're kids? Ah, I'm giving it to his mother. Fix yourself up. Timothy is coming tomorrow. -I want you to see him. -Mom! [in Hokkien] [Yolanda, on video] Look at here, Timothy. Charity. Smile! You and Timothy look good together. [Ang Kong laughing] [Felix's song playing] ♪ How can I tell you what I'm feeling ♪ [Charity] We've been here for hours. You're not talking to me. [Nathan] Your family was pairing you up with that Timothy guy and you never told me. And now he's coming home. [Charity] It's because he's not important in my life. [Nathan] Who is he, anyway? How do I know if he isn't important to you, you're not telling me anything. Timothy was just my childhood friend. We grew up together and went to the same school. [bell ringing] [Timothy] Charity! Wait up! [Charity] Hurry! [in Hokkien] That's okay. Just hurry! We may get there in time. Hurry! [Timothy] Okay, we made it! [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [both sigh] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [Timothy groans] [in Tagalog] Timothy, I know it's you. [Timothy] You always know it's me. Of course! Come, teach me Hokkien. Charity, I want to tell you something. -What? -Uh… um… You should learn that fast, because… We're leaving. We're moving to Canada. Uh… Charity. We're moving there for good. What? You're leaving? Yes, I don't want to go. I don't want to leave you. It's hard, but it's what Mom wants. Timothy was my best friend when I was a kid. And when our parents paired us up, we never took it seriously. And since he left, we didn't have any communication. Don't get threatened. Who's threatened? Me? How can a handsome guy like me get threatened by some nerd like him? [scoffs] Don't mention it. He doesn't stand a chance. You're so arrogant, are you? It's a good thing that I love you. Oh? Do you really love me? [light music playing] [Yolanda] I'm so happy, Mollie. [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in English] Oh, Williamson, it's nice to see you. [in Tagalog] My son, Emerson. Remember? [Mollie in English] Oh, this is Emerson, hello. [Yolanda] Dad, Mom. -[Mollie] Hello, it's good to see you. -[Ama] Oh, Mollie, how are you? -[Yolanda] Carol. -[Mollie] Hello, Carol. [Yolanda in Tagalog] Anderson, Carol's husband. -[Williamson] Mollie, Mollie! -[in English] Yes? -[in Tagalog] Dad is sleeping. -[in English] Oh! Okay. Yolanda, you have such a happy family. -Oh, Charity! It's good to see you. -Auntie! Mom. Good afternoon. [sneezes] [Mollie] Oh. Are you okay, Yolly? -Excuse me, excuse me. -[in Tagalog] Please wait. [Mollie in English] Well, hello. I'm Mrs. Lam. [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [scoffs] Charity. [in Tagalog] I don't think I'm welcome here. Why did you bring me along? So it'll be clear to everyone that I have a boyfriend. [in English] You'll do good, promise. [in Tagalog] Anyway, he maybe looks like a gay nerd. Loser. [in English] Here's my son, Timothy. Honey, come on. [Mollie] Everybody's waiting for you. You have to meet everyone. -This is Auntie Yolanda, Uncle Williamson. -Hi. -[Williamson] Hello, hello. -[Mollie] And that's Grandma. -[Timothy] I missed you. -[Mollie] And this is Emerson. -[Mollie] And that's Anderson and Carol. -[Timothy] Hey, how are you? -[Mollie] And Grandpa is there. -[Williamson] Sleeping. -Charity! Oh, wow. -Timothy? [laughs] [in Taglish] I can't believe it's been ten years! I could see you again. I'm so glad you're here! -[Timothy groaning] -[Charity laughing awkwardly] [in Tagalog] Nathan, Timothy is Charity's childhood friend. Let me introduce you. Timothy, this is Nathan. Nathan, bro! I'm Charity's boyfriend. You look like someone. It's Felix Yan, the famous singer from Singapore. -Yes, that's him. -That's me. Felix is my screen name. Timothy is my real name. Even I didn't believe it at first. Charity, come with me to the kitchen. -[Timothy] Yolanda, Yolanda. -[Charity] Please wait. You're so hard-headed. Send that boy home now. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Why? Timothy isn't family either. -Timothy is welcome. -Mom, what's your plan? Plan? You always think I'm up to no good. I know you, mom. [in Hokkien] -[dramatic music playing] -[operatic singing] [harmonizing] [in Tagalog] Are you okay, bro? Huh? Well, yes. So Felix, aren't you based in Singapore? -Yes. -So what are you doing in the Philippines? [in Taglish] Oh, ever since Timothy won the Asian Idol contest, [in English] He's not only popular in Singapore, [in Taglish] But also in Malaysia, Thailand and Hong Kong. That's why we thought, it's about time he concentrates here in the Philippines. [in English] Mom, come on. [in Taglish] Timothy, honey, why'd you feel embarrassed? [in Tagalog] How many times do I have to tell you [in English] it's about time that you have to accept the fact that you're very, very famous, honey! [in Taglish] I'm here to promote my album, bro. And you? What do you do? Um… [in English] I'm a veterinarian. -[Timothy] Oh. -[Mollie] Mm. I don't like animals, especially dogs. [in Tagalog] A dog bit me when I was a kid. -[Emerson] Animals are dirty, right? -[Nathan] Um… I care for other animals aside from dogs. [Nathan] Sometimes cats, birds. Sometimes even iguanas. [laughs loudly] [Williamson] Dad. [in Tagalog] I arranged a marriage for you and Timothy [in Taglish] because your animal signs are compatible. Animal signs? Ma, what's the use of the Chinese zodiac if there's no spark? Spark? What spark? Do you know Nathan's sign? No. Animal signs are always reliable. If you're not compatible, sparks are irrelevant. What do you think you are? Electric source, which sparks? [Timothy in English] Well, I was born on October 10, 1983. So that makes me a water pig, I think. -[Caroline and Ama] Wow! -[Mollie] Water pig. [in Tagalog] That's why he and Charity are a good match. Our sister is a fire rabbit. And you, Nathan? When is your birthday? [in English] May 13, 1981. '81, '81… Oh. That makes you a metal rooster. [in Tagalog] You and Charity have very low compatibility. Uh… Do you really believe in that Zodiac stuff? [in Taglish] The Chinese Zodiac is based on math and science. -That's why you need to believe it. -That's right! [in Tagalog] You and Timothy are a good match. Think about it. He's handsome, Chinese, successful, and famous all over Asia. Mom, I already love someone. What's wrong with you? Why are you giving me so much grief? Mom, that's unfair! You're rebelling against me and your father. Just remember this, Charity. You don't respect tradition. You don't obey your parents. [in Taglish] You'll have bad luck all your life! [cooks whispering in Tagalog] Oh, my. Bad luck? [Yolanda] What? What? What are you all whispering about? You, work. You, cook! You, pound. You, chop! Well, Timothy, my way of finding out compatibility is very simple. Um, your last name is Lam, right? Yes. Why? [laughs] -Timothy Lam, Charity Kho. -Yes. You and Charity aren't a good match. Because if you get married, she'll be Charity Kho-Lam. [laughs] -[Mollie in English] Oh, there she is. -[Timothy] Mom. -[Mollie] Okay, Timothy. -Okay. -[in Tagalog] Oh, how are you? -I'm okay. [Timothy in English] Auntie Yolly, Uncle Willy, Mom and I have a surprise for you. [Emerson] Oh, gift. -[Yolanda] Oh, wow. -[clapping] [Yolanda] It's beautiful! I painted it myself. [in Taglish] How do you know how we looked? [in English] We haven't seen each other in close to 10 years. Well, Auntie Yolly kept sending pictures of you guys all these years. -[Ama] Aww! -[Mollie] Do you like it? Uh. I think, it's a perfect time to make a toast. [in Tagalog] To celebrate your surprise for Charity's family. -Bro, just a minute. -[yells] Emerson, Emerson. [Emerson] Now I have to take a bath. -[Emerson] Now I have to take a bath. -[Yolanda] Emerson. Anyway, let's open this. So we can make a toast. -[champagne pops] -[all screaming] -I'm sorry. -[in Hokkien] -Sorry. -[in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Yolanda, why did you wash your face in our living room? [screams] I'm so sorry. I am really sorry. [jeep clunking] [jeep spluttering] Why are we here? We look like his assistants. Timothy is our visitor, we need to accompany him. Ma, I have to leave in a while. You're staying here. You can't leave. [Nathan] How unlucky! [light music playing] -[in English] Hello. -[fans screaming] Hi, how are you, so what's up, Felix? Are you staying here for good? [in Tagalog] Are you staying in the Philippines? Do you have future plans, now that you're here? Well… [in English] Friends, let's welcome Felix Yan. -Good afternoon. -[host] Welcome to the show. -Thank you. -We're so elated to have you here, Felix. [in Taglish] So how's your stay in the Philippines so far? Well, it's great. [sighs] -Last time I was here, I was still a kid. -Well, you're still young. Well, uh, it's great, it's been great. So does this mean you're concentrating here for your career? Maybe, maybe. You sound unsure. For this next question, give us a certain answer. Is there already a Filipina who has captured Felix Yan's heart? None so far, but who knows? Maybe in the future. Promise me when it happens you'll give us the scoop. But for now, maybe you can sing us a song, Felix. Of course, of course. Okay friends, here he is, Felix Yan!

I couldn't say no to mom. She'll get mad at me. That's okay. There's always a next time. You take care. I'll leave this place as soon as I can. I'll call you later. Bye. -[Johnny] Come on. Just choose a song. -[Kate] Doc Johnny, do it. [in Taglish] Thanks for being here. I know you had other plans. [in Tagalog] Maybe because our parents are being too pushy. [in English] Let me make it up to you. [in Tagalog] Let's go out to eat. That's a good idea. Where should we eat? Charity, what should I do? Your mom doesn't really like me. What are you saying? It's just normal, you'll get her soon. [Charity] Mom! Huh? Charity! [in English] What a coincidence. -[Timothy] Hey. -Good evening. -Nathan. -How you doing? [in Tagalog] What are you doing here? I'm the one who should ask you that. Oh! Wait. Someone's calling my cellphone. I didn't hear it ring. -It was on silent mode. -When did you learn to silence your phone. Shh! Hello. Okay, I'm on my way. It's my dentist. I forgot my appointment. You take care of Timothy. -Mom, mom. -[Timothy] You know I can manage. [phone rings] It's ringing. You aren't talking to anyone! Defective! Hello? I'm sorry. Your mom's really stubborn. -Felix, can we have a picture with you? -Yes, okay. Sir, can you take a picture of us? [Nathan] Okay. Damn that Timothy guy! We were on a date and he was with us the whole time. And he was acting cute all that time. He thinks he's too handsome! He even made me his photographer! [Johnny] Don't let it affect you. If it's not yours, it'll never be yours. [in English] What's meant to be will be. [in Tagalog] This calls for desperate measures. If you don't want to get outrun, better be quick. What do you mean? [Johnny] Ask her to marry you. [lively music playing] [Mrs. Go] Nathan! I've been telling you to get this. Your girlfriend will love you for it! [upbeat playful music playing] [cheers and applause] Hey! Where's Mrs. Go's dog's ribbon? He's up next. It's here. I'm just waiting for the best time to ask Charity to marry me. What? Are you going serious on that girl? Even if her parents don't like you? When the "Chekwa" say they don't like you, they mean it! They don't like being called "Chekwas." They're Chinese. [in English] And that's the chance I have to take. [in Tagalog] I'm gonna ask Charity to marry me. [Kate] There are lots of other girls out there, whose parents and siblings won't get in your way. Even though you smell like a dog. I know there's a lot, but my heart only knows one girl. That is Charity. [crowd] Wow! Timothy, I know it's you. You still remember that? How could I forget? You're the only one who always does that to me. Time flies so fast, doesn't it? [in English] Look at you now. No, look at you now. [in Tagalog] You're so famous. You're no longer that asthmatic kid who used to get hit with a stick by teachers. [in English] I'm still the same Timothy. [in Tagalog] No, you're not. You're already popular. You're recognized everywhere you go. People are cheering for you. That's Felix. I'm the same old Timothy. Because the things I loved before are the same things I love now. [birds chirping] -[Caroline] What's taking Emerson so long? -Charity. -[Charity] Yes, Mom? -[Anderson] Just let him be. It's a good thing you didn't leave. The calendar says no one should leave the house. Don't receive visitors either. It's bad luck. -Timothy. -Yes, Auntie? [in English] I was just looking for you. [in Tagalog] It's boring here. There's nothing to do. -Why don't you sing Charity a song? -Mom! [in English] Why not? [in Tagalog] Timothy was always singing for you when both of you were still kids. [in English] Remember? [engine purring] [doorbell rings] -Baday, Baday! -[Baday] Ma'am. [Baday] Yes, ma'am? [in Tagalog] Tell whoever rang the doorbell to go away. We can't see visitors now. Yes, ma'am. Let's just allow your mom to do what she wants. It'll be fun. -Okay. -Okay. Hey, Nathan! It's you. Baday, talk to the security guard. I just want to talk to Charity. I'm sorry but no visitors are allowed today. And they're all holed up inside. You know the Chinese, don't you? Tell Auntie Yolanda, if she's planning to separate me from Charity, it won't work. -I love her daughter. -[Baday gasps] -Let him in, Budong. -Are you crazy? Ma'am Yolanda will fire me if I do that! If you don't let him in, I'm breaking up with you! If they see you, tell them you climbed the fence. -Okay. -Come, hurry. Follow me, Nathan. Just stay here. I'll call Ma'am Charity. Please, stay. [Timothy singing and playing piano] [Mollie in English] So talented. [grunts] ♪ Now I know that love is never late ♪ [Mollie] Didn't imagine that he'd win the Asian Idol. [Timothy] ♪ My heart is mended By your love… ♪ Hey, Charity. Charity! -[in Tagalog] What is it? -Come. Hurry! Come here, come. Why are you calling her? -I need to talk to Charity. -You're rude. Can't you see Timothy is singing for her? Go back to the kitchen! But Ama doesn't want me there. She doesn't want to be disturbed. Go to the kitchen. You can do the dishes, laundry, sweep the floor, and you remove your makeup! Ma'am, not now! Okay, I'll do the dishes. [laughs] -[grunts] -[glass breaks] [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] I said no visitors! [Charity] Nathan, oh, dear. [Williamson] Why did you fall? -[Williamson] What did you do? -[Yolanda] Why did you come in? [Yolanda] I said no visitors! -[Charity] What are you doing here? -[Yolanda] Guard! [Charity] What are you doing here? Didn't I tell you I can't see you today? I told you mom is old-fashioned when it comes to tradition. Especially with the Feng Shui. Tradition? I think your mom is using tradition as an excuse to bring you closer to Timothy. What do you mean? A while ago, you two were so sweet when he was singing for you. Don't you trust me? I trust you, Charity. I don't trust Timothy! What are you saying? Are you jealous? Isn't it clear to you who I'm in love with? Charity, you can't blame me for being jealous. You have a long history with him. You've known each other since you were kids. How about us? Your family doesn't want us together. [somber music playing] Nathan. [Yolanda] Charity! Charity! Get in here! -Ama. -Here. [in English] Black chicken soup, my favorite. [in Tagalog] I put a lot of herbs. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] But Grandma, isn't it that soup is served only before a meal? [in Hokkien] [in Taglish] Chicken soup is best served at the start of every meal. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Just like you and Nathan. [in Taglish] What's wrong, if you humble yourself by contacting Nathan? Your favorite is black chicken soup. You can drink chicken soup any time. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] You should see Nathan, though he's done something wrong to you. [dramatic music playing] -[both yelling] -[swords clanking] [both yelling and grunting] [swords clanking] [swords clanking] [Nathan groaning] [Nathan moaning] [Johnny] You've been moaning. You fell asleep from drinking too much. [Kate chuckles] Even in my dreams, I'm a loser. It's just a few bottles and you're already drunk. And you were babbling. Right, Kate? [giggles] Yep. All about your girlfriend's "Chekwa" family. -Let's eat. -[Nathan's dad] It's Charity. [Nathan's mom] Charity. -[Charity] Mom, Dad. -[Nathan's mom] Why are you here? Good evening. Where is Nathan? We thought you were together. Uh… No, we weren't. Hey, hey! Don't tell anybody else about it. Huh? I'm dead if Charity finds out. What's up with you, Nathan? You're always saying, Charity, Charity. I'm starting to get sick of that name. All day, you were talking about her. -Did he get sick? -[Nathan's mom] No, no. [crickets chirping] Maybe he's just busy at the clinic. -I'll go ahead. -Okay. [Johnny] I'll go pee and we'll head home after I come back. [moans] [exhales deeply] Why don't you look for him at the bar he always visits with Johnny? They're together, he might also be there. -Yes, try it. -He might be there. Kate? I have waited long for you to kiss me. You always look the other way. Meanwhile, you never lay your eyes on me. [somber music playing] -Charity. Charity. -[Kate] Nathan. Charity. Charity, Charity! -Wait. -Let go of me! Charity, let me explain. What else are you to explain that my eyes didn't see? I have slanted eyes, but I'm not blind! Wait, wait, wait. I'm not the only one at fault here. You were the first. You entertained Timothy, you were even singing together. You're wrong! I couldn't say no to Mom that time. And if I was thinking of anyone then, it wasn't Timothy. It was you, Nathan! Easy for you to say. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] What did you say? I didn't understand you. [in English] I guess that's the whole point. [in Tagalog] We couldn't understand each other anymore. Charity. -[crickets chirping] -[dog barks] Hey, what's that? Nothing, dad. Would you keep a secret from your father too, son? Are you going to propose to Charity? I hope so. But she's mad at me now. You had a fight? You know, son, girls have to be given lots of attention. Try to be more romantic. I don't know how. Surprise her. Do you know how I proposed to your mom? I placed the ring inside a steamed rice cake. [giggles] She was so surprised when she saw it. That's what being romantic is. [Nathan's dad] Because Charity is Chinese, go get a buchi. Put the ring inside the buchi. [Nathan] Are you serious, dad? [Nathan's dad] Of course! So she'll be surprised. So when she gets it, her heart will melt. Williamson will be late. He's at a meeting. Eat! Timothy, what do you want? [Yolanda] Spare ribs, crab soup, or Hototay? Oh, Carol, don't eat that! You won't get pregnant! Anderson, don't scoop the soup away from you. It'll drive the good luck away. -[Yolanda] Okay? -[Ang Kong] You talk too much. Just eat. -Good evening to you all. -[Charity] Nathan? [Charity] Just a moment. What are you doing here? How did you know we were here? From Baday. Nathan, it's good you're here. [in English] Ah, have a seat. [in Tagalog] Please sit beside Charity. [Nathan] Thank you. I brought a gift for you all. [Nathan] Buchi. He bought those at a street corner. [Mollie in English] Hmm, the spice beef is very good. [in Tagalog] But not as good as when Timothy cooks it. My son is a very good cook. The girl he marries will be so lucky. -He knows a lot of recipes. -I'll try Nathan's. Huh? Uh… What is it, Nathan? Is there a problem? Mmm. -This tastes good. Delicious! -What's your problem? -[Ang Kong] Where did you buy this? -Stop Ang Kong. Huh? [coughing] -[Ang Kong choking] -[all exclaiming] -[gasps] -[Yolanda] Shoot. [Yolanda] That's my water! [light music playing] [in English] Charity, will you marry me? -[Johnny yelling] -[Kate] Nathan! [Yolanda in Tagalog] Who are you? -[Kate] Let go! -Nathan, I'm sorry! Kate, what are you doing here? Are you drunk? [Kate] I just want to talk to you. Why are you avoiding me? -[Johnny] Kate, stop it. -I'm in the middle of something here. [Nathan] Whatever it is, can't it wait? It can't wait, Nathan. -You all need to know, -[Nathan] Kate! -[in English] that I love Nathan! -[Nathan] Kate! -[in Tagalog] I love you, Nathan. -[Nathan] Kate, I'll take you home. Why are you forcing yourself into that family? [Kate] Who do you think they are? They're just like everybody else. Isn't that Yolanda woman insecure? -Me? -[Nathan] Kate, stop it! -And isn't Emerson paranoid? -[Nathan] Kate, stop it! And Anderson. -[Kate] Hey! He's barren. -[Nathan] Kate, stop! Two paranoid siblings and the other one is barren. -[Nathan] What are you doing, Kate? -[Kate] But Nathan. -[Johnny] Let me. -[Kate] Hey, Nathan! -[Nathan] Bring her home. -[Kate] Nathan, I love you! Nathan! This is your fault, Charity. You didn't listen to me. Charity. Charity, I'm sorry. Why… why did you do this? Why are you telling everybody about my family's flaws? [Charity] Why do you gossip about us? Charity, I'm sorry. I just wanted to ask you to marry me. Marriage? Look what's happening to us this early. Why should we get married? Maybe it'd be better if you go with your woman. You and her are a better match. You stay away from my daughter. You're troubling our family. You're bad luck. [in English] I'm sorry. [Nathan's dad in Tagalog] Are you okay, son? You haven't eaten since yesterday. I remember, dad. When I almost drowned before. I was very scared. I thought it was the end. [Nathan] I thought there was no way out. You know… that's what I'm feeling right now. I feel like I'm drowning. But now… it seems that no one will come to save me. Relationships are like that, son. [Nathan's dad] There are hardships. -Both of you can get through it. -I don't know, dad. What if Charity's mom is right? [Nathan] What if we're not meant for each other? ♪ My heart has a mind of its own ♪ ♪ Right or wrong it's gonna do ♪ ♪ Only what it feels is true ♪ ♪ I'll follow it wherever it goes ♪ ♪ Anywhere it leads me to ♪ ♪ My heart has a mind ♪ ♪ Mind of its own ♪ ♪ Woah ♪ ♪ Mind of its own ♪ -You okay? -Yeah. [in Tagalog] I'm fine, don't worry. Looks like you need this. [in English] Thanks. [in Tagalog] Um… can I help you with anything? [light music playing] If you need me, I'm just right here. Nathan. Nathan! Nathan, please talk to me. Kate. I have things to do. Go away. I was drunk. I didn't know what I was doing. I panicked. I did those things because I love you. But I know you can't love me because you love someone else already. [in English] Nathan, I wanna make it up to you. [in Tagalog] For all the stupid things I did. How can you make up for that? Charity is mad at me. [Nathan] How can it ease her anger? You know what, Kate? Let's just talk some other time. -[Nathan] Just a moment, please. -[tires screech] What are you doing here, huh? I know you don't like me because I'm not Chinese. But I want you to know that I love your daughter very much. [Nathan] And I'd fight for her, even you. You don't understand, do you? You and Charity can never be together. You're from different worlds. -Just accept it. -I love her! Life isn't just about being in love. And you're too late. Charity has agreed to marry Timothy. [somber music playing] Don't bother us anymore. Stay away from Charity. You're not meant for each other. Charity, someone is looking for you outside. -Who is it? -I don't know. You? How did you know I was here? That's not important. Before you get mad, slap, or throw some acid on my face, please listen to me first. Why would I do that? [in English] Well, for one… [in Tagalog] Because I messed up your life. [in Taglish] And the weird part is you don't even know me. [in Tagalog] You're the one who made a scene at our dinner. You're the one who was kissing Nathan. You're his assistant. I know you. I want to fix things. Charity. The night you saw me and Nathan kissing in the club… I initiated it. He didn't know I kissed him. [in English] It really doesn't matter now. [in Tagalog] I'm in the middle of something. Don't you love him anymore? That's not important. I'm just going to hurt my family again. I don't want to put them through that again. -[applause] -[fans screaming] -Timothy asked me to come here. -Yes, he's about to sing. -Anton, this is Charity. -Hi. He's Timothy's manager. [Anton] You're just in time. Before I start my song, [in English] let me first tell you a story. [Timothy in Tagalog] Many people ask me why I came back to the Philippines. When I was a child, when I went to Canada, I left someone behind here in the Philippines. [Timothy in English] Somebody special. I thought I could forget her, but I can't. [in Tagalog] That's why I came back to the Philippines. [Timothy] I'm hoping that maybe this time she'll finally notice me. [in English] This song's for you.

[in English] Marry me. [Timothy in Tagalog] You won't be sad anymore. I don't know what to say. You're well aware of what I am going through, right? You don't have to answer right away. [in English] I can wait. [Timothy] I waited 15 years already. [in Tagalog] Waiting for a little longer isn't a problem. [in English] Just don't say no. [in Tagalog] All right. [in English] I will not say no. Thank you. See. [crickets chirping] [Nathan's mom] Nathan. [in Tagalog] Son. Is that what you really want to do? [Nathan] Yes, Mama. I've been preparing for this scholarship for a long time now. Mm. I just thought… that maybe, you are making that decision because you are just avoiding someone. Or running away from a problem? -[sighs] -Is it Charity? [sighs] Whatever problems you two had, [Nathan's Mom] I hope they won't get in the way of your dreams and ambitions. You're still young. Many wonderful things will happen to you. [somber music playing] [lively music playing] Oh! I don't know how it happened. It's like I was possessed. Mmm! [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] But how did I learn? It's because you're broken-hearted. You discovered the meaning of true love. You've known how to cook for a long time, but it's only now that you are feeling it. [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] Aw. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Love comes only once.

Charity! [in Hokkien] -[Yolanda] Charity! -[Williamson] Charity! Alex! Alex! [in Tagalog] Bring out the car! I accepted the scholarship in Australia. [Nathan] I just thought there's no reason for me to stay here in the Philippines. At least going there would let me help my family. Are you still mad at me? No. [Nathan] Let's forget about that. Why don't you help me pack up my things? [chuckles] Sure. [car honking] [uplifting music playing] I borrowed a sim card from your auntie. Use this to call from abroad. It has automatic roaming. Use this to save money. Take care, okay? Brother, don't you love Charity anymore? [car door closes] Nathan. [Charity] Nathan, it's Charity. Nathan. -Nathan! -Miss, nobody's there. [neighbor] Nathan left. Where did he go? His mother said he went to Australia. He got a scholarship. [neighbor] He'll be gone for a while. You see, Charity? He left you. He didn't fight for you.

[Timothy in English] What are you doing here, anyway? [in Tagalog] We're also fixing our wedding plans. [in English] Wow! Congratulations, congratulations. [in Tagalog] What if we have our wedding earlier? What about the week after next? A small wedding will be fine. Okay. I'll take care of it. Good. The faster, the better. Charity. Don't worry about me. I'm just really happy that we're getting married. [sniffling] [in English] Come here. [Charity crying] [in Tagalog] I'm sorry. I don't want to cry, but I just can't help it. -I'm sorry. -[Timothy in English] It's okay. [in Tagalog] Let it out. I'm here for you. It hurts, Grandma. Why did I have to see him again? Everything's okay already. I was trying to fix everything, and then I see him again? [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Don't cry anymore. All the pain came back, Ama. It all came back. Why did I see him again just as I'm about to get married? I know I don't love Timothy yet. But I can learn to love him, right? [Charity] I'll learn to love Timothy. [sniffles] Why? It's like he just left me to Timothy. Why didn't he fight for me? I thought he loved me. I thought he was willing to die for me. I was wrong. [Charity in Taglish] I thought life was like a fairy tale that has a "once upon a time" and a "happily ever after." I was wrong. [cries] [in Tagalog] Here's what I got you from Australia. Thank you. [in English] Congratulations! From your senior vet, I'm so proud of you. [in Tagalog] Thank you, sir. [Nathan sighs] Why did you say you were marrying Kate? When it's not true? What else was I going to say? They were all there, it just came out of my mouth. Are you okay? Do you know why I studied in Australia? [Nathan] Do you know why I accepted that scholarship? Because I told myself that I would do my best. [in Taglish] I'll work hard so I can be the best. [in Tagalog] So I wouldn't be insecure about Charity. So we'd be on the same level. For at last, her family would accept me. But I guess they'll never accept me, no matter what I do. So what's your plan now? I'll just go back to Australia.

[producer in Tagalog] Why? Timothy, Timothy. Son, is there no way I can stop you? [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] Timothy. [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] You're leaving? There's an offer in Singapore. I can't turn it down. [Timothy] They want me to appear on a TV show. I couldn't say no. All my commitments here, I'll accomplish them there. What about our wedding? [light music playing] Let's not continue it. Do you know how much I love you? [in English] I love you so much. I'm willing to set you free. Timothy. When I saw you with Nathan, I knew it already, that you still love each other. [Timothy] I don't want to imprison you. I don't want to own you because… you're not mine. [Timothy] I hoped and waited for you to love me, too. But I know that day would never come. Just don't forget me, okay? Every now and then please think of me. [in English] And maybe, one day, [in Tagalog] when I'm strong enough. [Timothy in English] Maybe we could be friends. [in Tagalog] I want that, too. [in English] I want you to be happy. [Timothy] Promise me you'll be happy, okay? [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] I've already given out the invitations! [in Hokkien] [Yolanda] Charity. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Why did Timothy back out from the wedding? [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] I did everything you wanted, but that was Timothy's decision! [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] You're the reason why Timothy has backed out. Let's fly to Singapore and talk to them. Let's push through this wedding. Ma, enough! [in Taglish] For once, try not to think of yourself or tradition! [in Tagalog] Please try to think about how I feel even for once. Of what I want and what will make me happy! Talk to your daughter! [Yolanda] She's hard-headed. She refuses to follow the tradition! [Williamson] That's enough! What? [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] Caroline and Anderson. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] And Emerson? Emerson is a very friendly kid. [Williamson] But has gone insane because of you. Look what you are doing with Charity. Forcing her to marry a man she doesn't love? [in Hokkien] [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] We've become very lucky with that, right? [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] I will only say this once, Yolanda. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Our children, They're losing their love for you. One day, you'll wake up and they'll all be gone. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] If you don't change, you will lose me too! [in Hokkien] [whimpering] [crying] [tires screech] [in Tagalog] Hurry! Hurry up! Stop! Is this the girl who had an accident? [nurse] Yes, ma'am. [Yolanda] Charity, my child. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] I should've never forced you. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Mom? I can hear Charity's voice. [Yolanda] Forgive me, child. I will pray to God for you. Ma, I'm right here. [sobbing] [Yolanda] I can feel Charity's presence. Ma, I'm right behind you. [both screaming] -A ghost! -No, mom. -I'm alive. -[Yolanda] Huh? [in Hokkien] -[Emerson in Tagalog] Who's this? -I don't know. I was in the other room and I could hear your voice. [Emerson and Charity shouting in surprise] Thanks. You're alive. Please forgive me. [Yolanda] I just wanted you to be happy. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] I was wrong. -I was wrong! -Mom! Don't! [dramatic music playing] [all cheering] [in Mandarin] [in Mandarin] [in Tagalog] Let's eat. Let's eat! There's a lot of food. Hurry. Baday? Baday. -Prepare the fireworks for Dad's birthday! -Yes, ma'am. -[Caroline] Mom! -[Anderson] Mom! [Baday] Why are you shouting? Is there a fire? Fire! Oh, my God, fire! -[Yolanda] There's no fire. Be quiet! -Come here, Ma. Caroline is pregnant! [exclaims] I'm about to have a grandchild! I'm gonna be a grandmother! [in Taglish] Everybody, everybody. Caroline is pregnant! [all cheering and clapping] -[Williamson] Congratulations. -[Caroline] Thank you, Pa. -What's wrong, Ma? -We're all happy… except for Charity. [in Hokkien] [in Tagalog] Ma, don't blame yourself. [light music playing] [Nathan in Tagalog] Always keep it safe with you. So that wherever you go, it's like I'm beside you. Liar. You gave up so easily. Why are you throwing it away? I gave you that. [light music playing] Nathan. Nathan, what are you doing here? I asked someone to bring him here. -[Charity] Huh? -He knows everything. [Charity] But why? It's not true that he left you. It's not true that he didn't fight for you. He came to me. I lied to you. I told him you chose Timothy. Ma, how could you do that to me? Charity. That doesn't matter anymore. [Nathan] What matters now is that I'm already here. But you're getting married. That isn't true, either. [Nathan] I just said that because I didn't want you to wait for me. Because I knew you were getting married. Nathan. Charity. I tried to leave you. [Nathan] To forget you. But I can't live without you. If I could become Chinese, I would've done it a long time ago. [Nathan] But I can't change who I am. One thing I can promise you, [Nathan] I will love your daughter. I will never hurt her. It was squeezed in my bag already. Your grandfather almost swallowed it. [Nathan] It landed in your mother's glass. It's been everywhere. It's a miracle that it hasn't been lost. Charity. [in English] Will you marry me? Yes. [clapping] [Ang Kong laughing] [fireworks popping] [Charity in English] Once upon a time in China. [in Tagalog] Actually, that's only here in the Philippines. I fell in love with a Filipino. [in Hokkien] [Charity in English] And we lived happily ever after.
