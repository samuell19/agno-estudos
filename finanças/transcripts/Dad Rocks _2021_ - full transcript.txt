You had months of maternity leave, you're being unfair. - Unfair? I'm being unfair now, Tom? - Yes, you are. You're always out playing soccer, but I'm unfair? [TOM] So soccer's the issue? - No, but I'm tired... - [TOM] I spent the whole day working and taking care of the baby while you were out having fun! [TOM] Now you say I can't take care of her!

I mean... Demanding! [TOM] It's not that I'm bad at managing... Managing? Managing, Tom? Your daughter and your partner, whom you called crazy! Mom, I don't wanna talk about this, I'm tired. Got any sheets? Tom. [ELISA] I shouldn't have started an argument with Tom. I complained and now look at what happened. He chose to leave, Elisa. He did but it's almost like I kicked him out. [CRYING] I should've kept quiet. I'm so tired. I'm tired, that's all. Calm down, my dear. It will be all right. Without Tom it can't be all right. Without Tom, my family is over. - It's over. - It's not your fault! You've been full of guilt since the baby was born! This is on him, it's his fault! [BLOWS NOSE] Tom needs to take a good look at himself and decide if he's going to be the father and husband you need. You know why, dear? Can I say something, from the bottom of my heart? You are a perfect mother and wife. No, I'm not. - You are! - I'm not. You are beautiful, smart, a great friend... You're the best! And our friendship, girl, I mean... Darling, you know you'll always have my shoulder, right? - [ELISA] Give me a hug. - You will... You will be so happy, you deserve happiness! Everything's gonna be all right. Let Tom figure things out and find himself, okay? [ELISA] Look how cute she is! Isn't she getting too much sun? No, Mom. It's not too sunny. It's nice out. Aren't there bugs or germs? The news is always warning against diseases over there! - Yeah, but... - I'm worried! Mom, I'm just taking her for a stroll, there's no need to worry, all right? All right, love. Mom... Mom. I have to go now, okay? Talk to you later. Bye. I love you! Laura's sending you love! Bye! - Elisa! - Hi, Gladys. Hey baby girl! You're Grandma's baby girl! She's so cute. - If you're here to defend Tom, forget it. - I'm not here to defend anybody. I want to know how you're doing. I'm like this. I love your son, but I'm done. It was the last straw. I got home to find his stupid friend on our couch, both of them completely drunk, and Laura sleeping in a bunch of dirty laundry! - Oh my God. - It's over! I've reached my limit! What a shame, such a beautiful couple... Look, I raised my son on my own after his father decided to leave us. And though I'm proud of it, I will not glorify this life. I also won't ask you to take my son back. I want you to know I'll do what's in my power to help you two raise Laura together. Even if you're apart. Okay? Can I tell you something? Sure.

And now we have a beautiful family, honey. I'm scared. I'm scared of what might happen to us, to our family... - You know? - I know this is difficult... But I feel this is what we must do. I'm scared too! Can I think about it? Of course. [INHALES] [TOM] You devote a part of your life to each child you have. It took a while for me to understand this. But after many struggles and hardships, [TOM] I managed to devote a part of my life to Laura. And then it got easier! [TOM] It's curious how you don't lose anything by devoting yourself like this. In fact, you get so much out of it. Sure, your child gets something too, but you get so much more, man. Where's Pedro? I got it, sweetheart. I know you're all used to watching my struggles as a first-time father... But today I'm getting serious. Today, I'd like to... I don't know, open up to you a bit more. [TOM CONTINUES] I think we're ready to devote another part of our lives. [TOM] This time, to Pedro. And Elisa, my love... You helped me become the father I am today, [TOM] and you would make me even happier and more fulfilled, if... [TOM] if you agreed to join me on this journey. [TOM CONTINUES] Honey, it's just that I'm sure... our family would be much happier and complete... [TOM] if you said yes. [ELISA] ...from generation to generation. Do you know where this treasure is? [ELISA] Now, it's in the house. Inside the house, - [ELISA] in a huge box on top of the... - [TOM] Pedro, Elisa, and Laura. Do you know what this is? It's paper. [TOM] Yes, sweetheart, it's paper. But this piece of paper is magical, you know why? Because with this piece of paper, I become Pedro's dad, [TOM] and Elisa becomes his mom. What about me? You're his sister, sweetheart. [TOM] Now I need to ask you something important. [TOM] Do you accept us as your new family? Yes! - [TOM] You do? With all your heart? - Yes! - [PEDRO] Yes! - Then gimme a hug! [ELISA LAUGHS] Go! Go ahead! Give him a hug! - Come here! - [PEDRO] I'm flying! - Jump, sweetheart! Jump high! - Oh my goodness. Such a warm hug! It'll be all right. [PHONE LINES RINGING] - What's up, Enzo. You wanted to see me? - Hey, Tom. Sit down. It's been a while, huh? Yeah... [ENZO] Anyway, looking at your performance review, [ENZO] we can see a, uh... [ENZO] steep decline in solved tickets. Plus, you're never available during the weekends, not to mention your days off. Yeah, I know. You don't have to say anything. I'm sorry, man. I just adopted an orphaned child, and my routine is all messed up. [ENZO] That's very noble of you. It's... a great thing you did. The thing is, I got orders from above... to let you go. Sorry? We're... letting you go. What orders from above, Enzo? - [ENZO] I have to obey my boss. - This is a shithole, - this is the only floor! - [ENZO] I have no problem with you, [ENZO] but the boss wasn't so understanding. [ENZO] So, unfortunately... Elisa's gonna kill me. [SIGHS] [VIDEO GAME SOUND EFFECTS] [DOOR OPENS] You're home, honey? You didn't go to work? I did! But when I got there... Comp time, you know? I had some comp time saved up and the guys said, "Tom! There's an inspection coming!" So I decided to use it. What about you? Left work early? [ELISA] No. I forgot my laptop, [ELISA] but I'm rushing back to the office. [ELISA] As fast as our compact can handle. [ELISA] Honey, could you pick up the kids from school? - Of course! - [ELISA] Okay, bye! [DOOR CLOSES] [SIGHS] [TOM] Man, it's good to be back. It's been a while, huh? This nostalgia won't last. You'll remember the beer is warm, the peanuts are stale... If we're lucky, this was served yesterday. - Thanks for inviting me. - Of course. And it's on me. - Don't worry. - Aw, you serious? I must accept, because... Man, I'm going through a rough time. I can't find a job. - [JÚLIO] Really? - Yeah. [TOM] Don't you know about any freelance gigs? If I hear anything, I'll tell you. You're my bro, don't worry. Margô said I should tell you she thinks your channel is brilliant. - What, really? - [JÚLIO] Really. - She's enjoying my videos? - [JÚLIO] She's loving them. [JÚLIO] But you really raised the bar. It finally hit her that I was kind of a selfie dad, and now I need some tips. Oh, you want some advice? - I want some advice. - Because if you do, I have some. [JÚLIO] Well, I could use some advice. - Then ask. - How come? I am asking. No, ask nicely. Like this... "Please advise me, Master Tommy." - Tom, for crying out loud! - [TOM LAUGHING] "Please advise me"... I taught you all you know! Hey, man! You should call Barreto. - [JÚLIO] Remember Barreto? - Yeah. - His business is really taking off. - Give me his number. - [JÚLIO] Oh, you don't have it? - No. - That's why I love technology, Tom. - Got it. There. [JÚLIO] And now for the breaking news. I started a YouTube channel. - Really? About fatherhood? - No, about soccer. - "Livin' for Amateur League". - That's what you called it? [LAUGHING] I love it! [ELISA] All right, let's go to school. - Lunch boxes ready... - Okay, grab your lunch boxes. Here's yours, sweetheart. Have a good day at school. Give Daddy a kiss. What a great kiss! Here, big guy. Gimme a kiss. Have a good day. Bye, honey. Enjoy your days off, lazybones. [ELISA] Let's go, let's go! [ELISA] Hey, why did you stop? [ELISA] Bye-bye! Bye! [DOOR CLOSES] Barreto? Look, I'm sending you the front end elements, and while you're testing I'll finish the back end, okay? I'll send you the invoice, all right? See ya! [GLASSES CLATTER] - Ugh, today's one of those days. - Why? [JOANA] Patriarchy Town is in full swing today. And where's the City Hall lawsuit? Don't worry, I didn't forget. I'll send it to you later. [JOANA] Better late than later, huh? And how's Pedro? Is everything okay? It's all wonderful. He's our second child, so it's easier. And how's Tom? Has he found a job? A job? I ran into Júlio and he told me Tom had been fired. [JOANA] You didn't know? I knew. He's still looking. If I hear anything, I'll let you know. 'Cause I mean, two kids plus a jobless man... [JOANA] May God have mercy on you. [TOM] Elisa... [DOOR CLOSES] - Elisa, dear! - Tomás de Aquino, you got fired? You got fired and didn't tell me? Seriously? - Baby, calm down. - I won't calm down! I'm already calm. When were you going to tell me? Calm down. - [ELISA] No! - Come with me. I got something that might clear things up. Give me your hand, come here. Come with me, honey. Hey, stop it. What is it, Tom? Spill it! Do you like it? What's this? Isn't it obvious? - We can finally sell our compact! - Tom... What are you planning? - You're unemployed, what is this? - I'm unemployed, but I'm not out of work. I got some freelance jobs. I can work from home, where I'm closer to the family. I'm happy, honey! - This isn't a prank, right? - Come here, Elisa. - [TOM] Get in. - What is it, Tom? [ELISA SCOFFS] I didn't tell you I got fired 'cause I didn't want to worry you. The storm is over, honey. With my severance pay, plus the money from the system I developed, I put a down payment on this car. And there are two more systems in the making. Tom, but... Is this for real? I mean, what if you run out of jobs? - How are we paying for this car? - Elisa, you worry too much. [ELISA SIGHS] Honey, we're a team, right? - Mhm. - There you go. And Dad Rocks is also earning us some money. Trust me. Let's take it for a spin. - Here. - Just a quick spin. [TOM CHUCKLES] [ELISA] I love this new car smell! [ELISA] Let's pick the kids up at your mom's [ELISA] and then we could get some ice cream! [ELISA SHOUTS WITH EXCITEMENT] So you're telling me you and your partner are expecting? Congratulations! [TOM] Ah, there are great things coming... [TOM] You'll see beauty in everything, every hug and every kiss will be wonderful, every time you play it will be fun, every gift your kids give you will seem like the most precious thing in the world. [TOM CONTINUES] But there's also a lot of change. And change can hurt, right? We never know if we're doing what's best for them. [TOM] Something's always off and it's our fault. [TOM] It's scary. It makes us want to protect them even from the law of gravity. So... Fly, my children. And never fear the ground. [TOM CONTINUES] That's what we should strive for. But you know how first-time dads are. We do what we're told! [TOM] Then comes the perfect baby wipe, the best school, the most amazing diaper, the Indian massage oil that does wonders! [TOM] You know what I've learned? That at the end of the day, our kids don't really care about how much room we have, because kids enjoy cuddling with their parents and sleeping in a makeshift bed. [TOM] Can a good school make a difference? Sure. But what kids really like is playing with their parents. Expensive toys aren't important. There's nothing more fun to a kid than a playground swing, or listening to Grandma's stories. [TOM CONTINUES] So, be the plane that will lift your children off the ground. There's nothing more fun than that. Or is there? There isn't. [LAURA LAUGHS] [TOM] You're expecting. You know the deal. You don't need more room, you don't need the best car, nor the perfect diaper. [TOM] What you really need is to be there, with them, being a real father, man. I mean... A big car can help. But being squeezed together in a compact helps much more! ["SOL DE GIZ DE CERA" BY EMICIDA PLAYING] Da... Da... - Daddy. - Da... - Da... - Daddy. [LAUGHTER] Being a father changed my life because I got a friend. My best friend. My father passed away when I was just six years old, and growing up without him in my life made me feel a responsibility to give my son all my love. Thank you, son, for being my friend and the best gift God could've given me. I love you. [WHISPERS] Being a dad transforms you. It makes us better human beings. It gives us the chance to be born again, not make the same mistakes, and heal old wounds. We realize all the silly things we'd always thought we're just silly things. I really wanted it. It was my life's dream. I used to picture a kid... I always loved kids, so I used to picture my kid, taking him to soccer matches, playing soccer together, teaching him, having some fun... Then time went by, and I thought I might never be a dad, then we eventually conceived, but lost the baby in the first month, right on my birthday, it was a miserable day. I was devastated, but... One month later we conceived again, it was a risky pregnancy, so for nine months her blood pressure was crazy. But it all worked out. This is Theo. Give us a smile, Theo. The love of my life. That's it. Have kids. It's the best thing ever. Before turning 61, I got a wonderful gift, the best gift ever. It was the birth of my son, Victor Hugo. After that, my life was changed forever. I became a child again while living with my son. The first time my son said the word "Daddy", I cried. And nowadays... I can't picture myself without this kid beside me. He's the best thing that has ever happened to me. They say you become a father when your child is born. But I don't think we have any idea how much our lives will change after that moment. Even after so long and after so many moments, I'm still not sure how to best handle different situations, so I'm working on becoming the best father I can be. This is my best friend, my partner and the love of my life, Luna. Since birth, men are told to avoid everything that has to do with fatherhood. I was never one to play soccer as a kid, or to have make-believe fights. I eventually met someone special, with whom I had two princesses. With fatherhood, I learned to let go of myself and to live for them, and this had an amazing impact on how I interact with women. Now more than before, I respect and recognize the strength and the importance of women. And every day I think about the world I want for them and by them.
