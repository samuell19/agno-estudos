SCHOOL OF DEATH London, 1899 And introducing Victoria Vera as Sylvia Director of photography: Antonio Ballesteros Story by Sandro Continenza and Alfonso Balcazar Additional material by Manuel Sebares Screenplay by Ricardo Vazquez and Pedro L. Ramirez Production manager: Joaquin Dominguez Directed by Pedro L. Ramirez Sylvia... Take charge until I return. You'll be punished. Who cares. It's getting closer to the day we can leave this place. Tomorrow's medical examination. What do you mean by that? You'll see him tomorrow. Yes. But what's the use of looking forward to that? Would a man like Dr. Brown be interested in an orphan like me? Why not? We know he looks at you a lot. Besides... Attention. The headmistress. I'll see you later, Leonore. Good morning, Miss Wilkins. Good morning, Mr. President. May God bless the generous benefactor of this noble institution. Young ladies, I'm very pleased with your behaviour. You shall soon be enjoying noticeable improvements to this establishment. My sole demands are that you observe the 3 ruling principles of this charitable institution: Silence, discipline and obedience. Enough, Miss Colton. I think you're going too far. She's incorrigible. And she doesn't submit easily, am I right, Miss Colton? Physical punishment is unfortunately necessary. She will not attend the medical examination tomorrow. She can't be seen in this state. She's still in the punishment room. They'll make her spend the whole night there. Don't worry. Try to sleep. There's nothing we can do. That must be the doctor. Poor Leonore. She always looks forward to this day. She must take a spoonful of this syrup every night before going to bed. Between the two of us, we'll get rid of your cold. Hurry up! Next! Elizabeth! Why waste any time? She's as strong as an ox. Well... She's the last one So you may go now, doctor. I've not seen Leonore today. Yes, we sent her to do a temporary job... for a client who found herself momentarily short of servants. Would you be so kind as to give me the address? I promised her some pills for her headache. Don't trouble yourself. Give them to me, I'll get them to her. That will be all, Sylvia. Sorry... I forgot to bring them. Miss Wilkins... Miss Colton... You know well that this day comes sooner or later for all of you. Yes, Miss Wilkins. Before entrusting you to the service of a family, this institution always ensures you'll be working for good, honest, God-fearing people. Thank you very much, Miss Wilkins. Will I...? Will I be able to see Leonore before leaving? The carriage is here. There's just time to pack your things. Certainly, Miss Wilkins. I don't like the prospect of you travelling at night. Hurry up. Yes, Miss Wilkins. Sorry, but I'd like to know the address where I'm going. The coachman has all the information Yes, of course. Excuse me, Miss Wilkins. Sylvia's on her way now to the house where she's going to work. Really? One day you'll also leave. - Couldn't you tell me where? - London's such a large city. Anyway, it's against the rules to give out that information. Although exceptions can be made. Please, Miss Colton! See? I may not be as bad as you think. Whoa. - Come on, out you get. - Is this it? Blind Crow House. We're here - You've forgotten something. - Oh, yes, my clothes. Thank you. Come here. Closer... This is your bedroom. I've never slept alone. You'll get used to it. You may keep your things here. But... ... what will I be doing here? I mean... Now you just need some rest. Thank you. Goodnight. The masters are out and will be back late. If you hear noises, don't be afraid. Tonight? Yes. Tonight. Don't be worried, my child. You're in the hands of science. I'm not going to kill you, or cause you any harm. On the contrary. I only regret having to operate while you're conscious. The brain must be fully awake for it to react. Calm down. There's nothing you can do. The incision must be thoroughly precise. I'll bet my beard against ten guineas on the journalist. Good, Dr. Brown! I accept your wager. Stop. An accident doesn't mean defeat. And I'm sure you're almost invincible, Mr. Allen. I marvel at the progress you've made. When you joined this club, you could barely hold the foil. And yet, in very little time... Congratulations, doctor, I hope you'll grant me a rematch someday. I'm fully at your disposal. Mr. Allen. Tomorrow I'll be clean-shaven, Mr. Grandfield. And I'd taken a liking to it. I'm so sorry. Lord Ferguson, you're not congratulating me on my defeat? No, it's something else. Something rather... ... sensitive. I hear you know of an address that could open the gateway to Paradise itself. Do I make myself clear, Allen? Like an open book. I do indeed have that address. Not that I've ever used it. So when it comes to women, you don't... Another insinuation like that and I'll send you my seconds. So, can I have that address? I don't know. It goes without saying that I'm a gentleman. Just one thing, Lord Ferguson. If you want that gateway opened to you, don't use my name. Use... ... the Honourable Grandfield's. That puritan Grandfield? Surely not? His name, at the other end of the thread, has the value of a talisman. Here's the death certificate. - Is it official? - Certainly. It's strange. A girl so full of life. Blind Crow House. Wait for me in my room. I've got more to say to you. I'll be there. You filthy traitor! Wait... I can... I can explain. There's nothing to explain. You disgust me! To achieve your own purposes, you brought yourself to... It's not what you think. Shut up! You shouldn't have done that. No! No! No need to wait for Miss Colton. Go to your bedroom. Tomorrow you'll start working for an honorable, God-fearing family. - Thank you very much, Miss Wilkins. - Now get some rest. It will be a long journey. - Where are we going? - To Willow House. - But... - In Forest Hill. - Is that in Lambeth? - No, much further. Hurry up, or we won't arrive till tomorrow. Are you all right? Yes, thanks. What happened? A wheel came off. I'll get some help. Wait here. Excuse me, is it far to Lambeth? This is Lambeth. Do you know where Blind Crow House is? Well... There's no big houses round here. Ask the woman at the florist's. I'm sure she'll know. Thank you. Excuse me. Is this Blind Crow House? Sylvia! Sylvia! Don't you know me? Don't you know me? It's Leonore. Go away! Sylvia, what's wrong with you? What is it? Hello. Hello! What is it, Miss? Anything wrong? Help me! They took her away. Calm down. Who's been taken away? My friend Sylvia. They've taken her. Please help me. Take it easy, just tell me what's happened. What happened to you? It was the coachman. He struck me with his whip. She was in this house. You're sure? Good evening. Who's making all that noise at this time of night? Do you know if anyone lives here? No, nobody. The last tenant, a very surly woman, left after her servant's burial. Goodnight! Is this yours? It's Sylvia's! My friend's medallion! See, officer? Good. Come with me. Dr. Brown! Good evening. Leonore, what are you doing here at this time of night? What's happened? Now, Miss. The doctor here has certified your friend's death. The doctor knew her very well. So he couldn't have mistaken her for someone else. I know my friend is still alive. I saw her, just like I see you now. Please, Leonore, calm down. That must have been a mistake. You can't possibly have seen her, you can't. Then explain: Why did the coachman not let me talk to her? How come the girl I spoke to was wearing Sylvia's medallion? It is hers, isn't it? Sorry, I thought you were alone. Come in, George, we were just finishing. - Good evening, doctor. - Good evening. Well, Miss, that will be all for now. But I still think you've been mistaken. Thank you for everything, inspector. If you don't mind, I'll accompany her home. That's fine with me. I'd forgotten... regarding that coachman, we'll soon find him. Good evening. - Goodbye. - Good evening. Yes. Here it is. Here we are. Now try to get some rest. I'm sure you'll see things differently tomorrow. I feel confused. I don't know. But I'm most grateful to you, doctor. You're welcome. I'll give you my address. If you ever need help, just call me. Thank you. What do you want? Good evening. Miss Leonore Johnson, I believe you were expecting her. Indeed we were, the mistress was getting impatient. I brought in the young lady's clothes, but I couldn't find her. What happened? Just a small incident of no importance. We had to go to the police station. But don't worry. I know her well. I'm the doctor at St. Elizabeth Refuge. - Goodnight, Leonore. - Goodnight, doctor. Welcome to Willow House. Yes, yes, I'm sure. She wore it all the time. Yes, indeed. She already had that medallion when she came here. And when did you say that young lady, Sylvia, went to Blind Crow House? That was exactly fifteen days ago. And how did you learn of her death? I was told by the school physician, Dr. Brown. Why hadn't Sylvia's employers told them of her death? According to Constable Miller, the mistress of the house went on a trip right after the burial. Rather strange, isn't it, inspector? You're right, Collins. This is a somewhat confusing affair. I'm beginning to think that... Yes, inspector? No, no, that would be absurd... But then... I don't know. - Krueger! Krueger! - I told you he wouldn't answer. If he's in a bad mood, he spends the whole day locked in there. I don't care! I must see him, Pamela! Krueger! Krueger, open up! It's Bob! What are you doing here? What am I doing here? It was you who made me come. Pamela's been trying to talk to you since last night. Why? What have you got to say to me? It's serious. That Leonore girl has seen Sylvia and the police are investigating. We had to tell you. So what do we do now? Nothing. If the police know she lives here, we must wait. It's up to me to decide all of that. I warn you: I want no more of this nonsense of you locking yourself up. I don't like your tone of voice, Bob. Don't threaten me! Take it as a threat if you like! This must be painful for you, but we have to dispel any doubts. Dr. Brown... Please. Did you tend Sylvia Smith? When they called me, it was too late to do anything for her. So what do you think caused her death? Her heart. Heart failure. I found an autopsy unnecessary, the symptoms were unmistakeable. This young lady claims she never had any heart problems. Indeed. But she also claims to have seen her last night. Wait. I want to see her! Let's go, Leonore. Anything unusual, doctor? No. Nothing at all. Nothing special. You may close the coffin. Where does Miss Johnson live? In Forest Hill. Forest Hill. Willow House. An isolated villa... - ...at the start of Sunset Road. - Pardon? At the start of Sunset Road. Thank you. Well, Inspector Coleman... if you don't need her any more, I'll take her home. No, I won't be needing her. As for you, young lady, if you come to me with any more ghost stories, I shall be furious. Understood? Get in. You know what I think? That what you need is some fun. That's my medical prescription. To Regent's Park. I'll never forget this day. The happiest day of my life. There'll be many more like this, believe me. That was Sylvia, doctor. Stop that coach! Please, Leonore. Just a few days ago, you saw for yourself that Sylvia was dead. - Don't you understand that? - Yes, doctor, you're right. It's something I can't explain, a strange feeling. Please, doctor, I beg you! - Let's follow that coach! - All right. Driver, follow that coach. It's gone into that house. Come with me. Now I must take you home. Home? But aren't we going to tell the inspector that...? Don't be a child, Leonore. We won't tell him anything. I'm sure, if we tell the inspector, when he goes to that house, he won't find anyone. There's something sinister behind all this. What shall we do then? Well... Nothing for the time being. We know she's still alive, and in that house. I'll investigate until we learn more. Trust me. Please be careful, it may be dangerous. Come in. Good evening, senora...? My name doesn't matter. I told you once. Yes... Yes... of course. Lord Ferguson. Sylvia. And now, with your permission, I'll take my leave. Of course, of course. Show the lady out. James, I won't be needing you again tonight. To your happiness. To... To yours. Would you mind taking off your cape? Why not? And the rest? No. Not yet. Wait... Guess what this machine produces. Music. I know this may seem hard to believe, my dear. It's a wonderful invention. And now, with no orchestra, no prying musicians, let's dance. What's the matter? But... What's the meaning of this? What's going on? What is all this? No! No! Where does Miss Johnson live? In Forest Hill. Forest Hill. Willow House. An isolated villa... at the start of Sunset Road. Pardon? At the start of Sunset Road. Thank you. Where does the girl live? In Forest Hill. Forest Hill. Willow House. An isolated villa. At the start of Sunset Road. Pardon? At the start of Sunset Road. Thank you. In Forest Hill. Forest Hill. Willow House. An isolated villa... at the start of Sunset Road. Pardon? An isolated villa... at the start of Sunset Road. Willow House... at the start of Sunset Road. at the start of Sunset Road. Very good. I'll tell him right away. All right. Not to worry. I was looking for you. I was talking to Bob. You've got to work on that girl tonight. I can't. I need more time. Bob says we must get rid of her immediately. All right. What will you tell Dr. Brown? Have you thought about that? Bob will take care of that. You! How did you come here? Who...? Who gave you this address? What's that in your hand? Give it to me! Help! Help! Don't move! I'm going to destroy you. You are the symbol of my failure. Madam. Madam! Don't be afraid. I'm not going to hurt you. Trust me. Just listen to me for a moment. I beg you. Don't run away from me. I'm appalled... at the ordeal this poor child has had to endure. I simply can't understand. The Richmonds had impeccable references. I've taken the liberty of bringing her to the school. I thought it was the safest place. You did the right thing, doctor. Now, Miss Wilkins, I must promptly tell the police what's happened. It's my duty. First I'll bring Leonore a cup of tea. I won't be a minute. Don't be afraid. I'll take you out of here as soon as possible. You'll see. Calm down. It'll all work out fine. This will comfort you. Thank you, Miss Wilkins. I must go now. I'll see you tomorrow. Goodnight, Leonore. Goodnight, Edward. Thank you for everything. Goodnight, Miss Wilkins. Shall I show you out? No. That won't be necessary. Clover Street. Come with me, dear. I was waiting for you. Come on! Up the stairs! You'll regret meddling in other people's business. But... But, Miss... You're a dangerous inconvenience. And... ... don't bother screaming. You know well that no screams can be heard through these walls. Edward! Edward! Hey! Where are you taking me? Stop! Stop! Look... What's going on here? The murderer didn't want his victim to be recognised. It looks like the work of a madman. But I didn't bring you here to speculate about the death of this woman whose body was found in the river this morning. The pathologist has something to tell you. You'll both find it interesting for the purposes of your respective jobs. See this small scar? I wouldn't have given it much importance if I hadn't seen a similar scar on the temple of the girl we exhumed the other day. Very interesting. It's strange you failed to notice it when you certified her death. Well, actually, when her employer, Mrs. Chambers, called me to certify her death, I didn't examine her further as the causes of death were quite clear to me. I see, such bothersome details are to be left to conscientious forensic pathologists. You've piqued my journalist's curiosity, doctor. Our friend Coleman seems to find it suspicious that those two scars should be so alike. Could you please explain? I remember that some 10 years ago, a doctor named Krueger became infamous for his surgical experiments. He claimed to have found a way of depriving the brain of its ability to store memories. In other words, erasing the memory with a scalpel. I've never heard of that. That's because you're too young, Dr. Brown. To go back to this Dr. Krueger, did he ever experiment on humans? Yes. That was his undoing. As he was being arrested, he set fire to his laboratory to destroy any evidence. Then something exploded in his face and it was reduced to one huge scar. He was imprisoned on Devil's Island. And I thought I had a big story on my hands. But if he's in Guiana... George, would I summon you here to waste your time? - And...? - Indeed. That criminal mind managed to escape almost 5 years ago. What I fail to understand is the connection between this and the scar found on Sylvia, and on this corpse. I wouldn't have made the connection if it was just him. But it so happens that he escaped in the company of one Bob Williams. A fine mind except that he used it for white slavery and blackmailing the wealthy. Are you insinuating that Bob Williams...? No, I am certain those two are working together in London. Krueger supplies the scalpel; Bob Williams the customers. This story is real front-page material. It might deserve even larger headlines if Dr. Brown, who must have known Sylvia's anatomy well, confirms our suspicions that the corpse is hers. The one that was buried, exhumed and buried once again? Do it for me, Brown. I'll give you anything in exchange. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I can't be so confident. Sylvia was always in such good health she never needed medical attention. Too bad. That would have given credence to a hypothesis that's been growing up here. You're turning out to be what we journalists call a fount of knowledge. Come on, Michael, open the floodgates. If that indeed is Sylvia Smith, then something must have gone wrong for Krueger and Williams. Well, that's all. Thank you, gentlemen, for your help. Thanks, Michael. I'm off to the paper. Goodbye. It's none of my business, but aren't you helping those criminals by making your suspicions public? I hope this will make them nervous and prone to making mistakes. The reports you'd asked for, inspector. If a reporter ever calls you a fount of knowledge, don't take offense, Collins. That's just what you are. What are you waiting for? Don't delay it. Get it over and done with. Hurry up! You'll have a good funeral. Merciful Lord, turn toward us and listen to our prayers: open the gates of paradise to your servant and help us who remain to comfort one another with assurances of faith, until we all meet in Christ and are with you and with our sister forever. And may almighty God bless all of you, who are gathered here. Go in peace, glorifying the Lord by your life. You refused to certify her death. How could you have done that to me? When I left her last night, she was in good health. Besides, I've been signing too many death certificates this year. Can't you see you're compromising us with your refusal? Poor Leonore will have to go through the cruelties of an autopsy. What will this do to our reputation? If you have nothing to fear... We were thinking of a grand funeral in her honor. Do it, please, for the sake of her memory. You still have time. She'll be taken to the morgue this afternoon. But the autopsy won't take place until early tomorrow. You've still got time to organise the most solemn of funerals for her. I must say I regret having brought you to this institution! Our friend Allen caused a furore with his article in the Daily Monitor. Do you think this will work? Well, the nets are cast at any rate. Inspector Coleman. I'm glad to hear from you. Go ahead. Are you sure of that? That could be dangerous. You can count on my support. Thank you, doctor. The first big fish is swimming towards our net. Put me through to 558 Postland. May I speak to the Honourable Mr. Grandfield? We've got the rest of them. Hurry up, Collins. Dr. Brown's been buried alive here. Th-thank you, inspector. Thank you... very much. Now, calm down. No need to worry. You're safe now. Your idea of pretending to be Krueger to bring Grandfield here has worked. But it almost cost you your life. - Take him away. - Yes, sir. Come on, you! When did you begin to suspect that the Honourable Grandfield was a front for Bob Williams? Well, I had an inkling of it when certain things, which would take long to explain, happened to me. Um... doctor. You really must excuse me. At the morgue, when I asked you to confirm that body as Sylvia's, I already knew it was hers. I don't understand. At the time I suspected everyone for various reasons. One of them was the fact that all those present at the cemetery had been told about Sylvia's exhumation a few hours beforehand. Do you remember that? When we arrived, the earth over the grave seemed to have been disturbed. Besides, her scar, hair color and build, as well as other details I won't go into, made me reach this conclusion. I'm sure, inspector, that this was not enough for you. No, certainly not. I went back to the graveyard and removed the coffin once again. - Do you know what I found there? - No. Rocks. Just rocks. When do you expect to arrest Krueger, I mean, the rest of them? It's a matter of hours. I'll soon be questioning Grandfield, after that we'll waste no time. You must come to my office tomorrow to make a statement and sign it. Excuse me, inspector. The pathologist has been looking for you. What's the matter? Leonore Johnson's body... has disappeared from the morgue. You must be mad coming here! Forgive me, Bob. It's just that... ... I'm scared. It was bound to fail. I could see this coming. This was Brown's doing. No. It wasn't him. It's Krueger's diabolical mind behind all this. He wants to get rid of us. Let's escape, Bob. We still have time. We can start a new life far away from here. We can be happy once again. I know. You needn't say anything. You never loved me. But... I've stooped so low. I loved you. But now... Now... ... it's all over. No. Not yet. Grandfield's been arrested but that doesn't worry me. Nobody knows that Bob Williams and George Allen are one and the same person. What do you mean? Only Krueger knows this. And you. The police! This is the end. I'm so sorry. Is she dead? We got here too late. Leonore. Leonore! it's me. Edward. Don't be afraid. I had to bring you here. It was the only place where I could bring you back to life. When they called me to certify your death, I realised you weren't really dead. You'd been put into a cataleptic state. It was them! That horrible man! Let's go. Take me out of here! Nobody's taking anyone out of here! What do you mean, George? I've no time for explanations. Incidentally, my real name is Bob Williams. Ever heard that name? You? Bob Williams? I didn't know you were here. I was looking for someone else. But you've saved me some trouble. I'd have looked for you afterwards anyway. As you may understand, neither of you can leave here alive. Krueger! Don't look at me like that. I... I don't know what to say to you either. I know... ... that I've lost. I don't exist. The more I needed to live... ... the more I needed the life you gave me. I... I don't know if I can call you... ... Leonore. My... My Leonore! I am... sorry... ... that you have to see me... like this. Because... Because it was... It was me... who you loved. And not... Not the mask of some arrogant young man. And yet... it was me. It was... ... my eyes... ... which conveyed... ... the message of my voice... ... to the depth of your eyes. And it was... ... my soul... ... that reached... ... your... ... your heart... ... through my... ... through... my words. I... I...
