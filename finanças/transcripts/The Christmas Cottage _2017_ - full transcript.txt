Your home should be your domain, with a space devoted to work. As I hope my design conveys, at Quinn & Whistler we aspire to advance the concept of housing from just home to whole life, with a space for recreation, and a space to rest in a room that invites the outside in. This is a concept house that does away with walls and limitations. The occupant has complete control over their inside and outside worlds. Using virtual windows you can gaze at whatever you desire. That may be a sunny beach. The New York skyline. Or you can even have Christmas 24/7. How many rooms come equipped with this feature? All of them. So each inhabitant can have a personalized experience. Very impressive. That's not all. The house is not only designed to address the inhabitant's need but also intuit their needs. The house knows when to put itself and its occupants into rest mode. Sensors in the house acclimate to your patterns so it knows when you finish work and go to bed, and it knows when you wake. The house wakes up, too. I feel like I could move in tomorrow. I could move in today. Very, very impressive. Lacey. You blew the clients away. You mean prospective clients. After your design and presentation we are on the verge of landing the biggest clients at Quinn & Whistler has ever had. It's time to celebrate. What is this about? Word travels fast. So, as all of you have heard, we are this close to cinching the Pine Bay Development deal. It's a housing development of 20 houses and our design, our model house is still among the top choices. So eat, drink, and be merry because after the holidays it's over. Overtime for all of you. - To you. - Cheers. Don't you think it's a little premature? Fortune favours the bold. And workaholics? To us. Pine Bay emailed over the specifications for the revised renderings. It looks doable. Nothing that you can't handle. I can't believe this is happening now. Could the timing be any worse for the career shot of a lifetime? You mean the holidays? We broke through Christmas before. I mean Ava's wedding. Right. - I fly out tonight. - It's five days away. - I'm maid of honour, remember? - Cancel. Walter. You get the flu, it's bad. Pine Bay Development flu. It's contagious. You don't wanna get anybody sick. I mean, you weren't that eager to go in some winter lodge and wear a big poofy dress, were you? I'm pretty sure backing out of your best friend's wedding is ground for friends divorce. Right. Besides, it's Christmas. When miracles happen. And I promise we will get all of the work done and we will land this deal. Promise? Have I ever let you down? Never. See you in a few days. Thank you. - Ava! - Hi! - You're here! - Hi! Isn't it all just the best? Christmas, my wedding, two of my favourite things. Since you were six years old. Five, actually. Tell me this isn't a case of last minute cold feet. Hardly. I just thought I'd take some stuff up to the cottage today. I know in all of the wedding madness Mason and I will forget things that we need. Come with me? I mean, it's been forever since we've both seen it and we've spent so many happy times there. I would love to but I was going to try and get a little work in before the welcome party. We're on the verge of landing this huge project. I was kind of hoping that this could be a work-free zone for you. I'm sure I can spare a little time. OK. Let me put my suitcase upstairs. OK, let's go. So, how's Roger? He's great. Our design firm is doing really well. No, I wasn't asking about your professional life with Roger, I was asking about your personal life. Our relationship makes sense. We're great partners, we get each other. Really? He's smart and accomplished. He's driven. He's handsome and successful and I never have to worry about what his priorities are. Well, that's all great but not exactly "sweep you off your feet" great. Don't you want that? True love? Passion? Romance? I did, probably, you know, when I was a teenager. Getting swept off your feet isn't everything, and with Roger everything's clear. He's reliable, stable, predictable. There's no... Ean! Hi! Hi, little sis! Surprises. Lacey, dear. Aunt Sarah. Oh my gosh. What a treat to have you here. So, I hear you're quite accomplished now. I never doubted it. You know, all that time you spent drawing up in the cottage. I knew it would mount to something. You were always encouraging my creativity. It meant a lot. Especially when my mom passed away and my dad was trying to do everything on his own. It's terrible to lose a parent when you're so young. But I was honoured to be your village. You have to find me and tell me all about your life in San Francisco. - OK. - Promise? I can't believe you made it. You really kept us guessing up until the last minute. I know, my schedule's a little erratic. But even vagabond chef's can't miss their sister's wedding. And look, an early wedding gift. Fresh mistletoe from an island off the coast of Scandinavia. I will hang this in the Christmas Cottage. I'm on my way there now with Lacey. Great. That's... that's great. I'm glad that she's here. I'm surprised she's not working. I'm kidding. No, that's... that's good that she's here. And don't worry, everything will be cool between us. Solemn promise? Ava, we dated a lifetime ago. Two lifetimes ago. At least that's what it felt like. Hi Lacey. Hi Ean. Well, you look just like I would imagine a big city designer to look. And you're very backpacker chic. This is kinda the standard uniform for us culinary explorers. Of course. I didn't know that was an official career. Official, no. But you know better than most, I've never been a fan of official titles. Yeah, I know that very well. Hey all. - Hi! - Welcome. Hey. Hey, buddy. Mason, honey, good timing. Why don't you help Ean get settled in and Lacey and I will go up to the cottage. Great. OK. See you all later. Have fun. - Bye. - See you all later. It's been so long. Yep, still looks the same. Probably the same when Ean's saw it too. Can you believe that we're back here? You ready? Alright, let's go. Remember when we used to pretend this place was an enchanted castle? Of course. Forks and spoons were wands, the glasses were magical crystals. I still think this place is enchanted. There's magic here at Christmas, I can feel it. You know, anyone who's ever stayed here during Christmas time has found true love. Don't you think that's a myth? Well, it's been in my family for generations and it's been proven right for generations. My great-grandmother pretended that she wasn't absolutely in love with my great-grandfather. And so they spent the night here one Christmas and then they woke to find that they were deeply in love and they spent the rest of their lives that way. And then my grandparents spent their wedding night here, same thing. And then you know how loving and wonderful Aunt Sarah's marriage was. They were happy every day they spent together. Soon Mason and I will find that same magical happiness. Is that why you chose this place for your honeymoon instead of, say, Hawaii or Greece or Tahiti? You can tease me all you want. I still believe it and you used to, too. Remember when we would run around here with towels on our heads pretending we were brides? Until Ean made fun of us. That was so long ago. It's great that you still believe it. And it's sweet of you to offer to get it all set up for us. Are you kidding? Design is my speciality. Still, thanks for stepping in. With all of the wedding stuff coming up I don't even have time to think about getting this place spruced up and I want it to look perfect. I'm way ahead of you. I ordered all the decorations online with overnight shipping, it'll be here tomorrow and then all I have to do is set it up. I even got this super cool mid-century modern tree. OK, time out. You ordered a tree? Yeah. It's very retro-chic. Lacey, I don't want a retro-chic tree. I want a big pine tree. You know, the kind that you cut down? You want me to cut down a tree. That's... that's a little more time consuming. I want this place to just be bursting with Christmas. With a few designer flourishes, right? I mean, I do have a theme picked out. Just make sure it feels like Christmas. The ones we used to spend here. OK. Anyways, we should get back to the hotel so that you can get changed into your party gear for the welcome party. This is my party gear. But it's... it's so Grey. And sleek and sophisticated. This is all I own. OK, you've become one of your designs. We need to get colour back into your life asap. - Hi. - Hey. How are the designs coming? Great. I blocked out 4 pm on tonight to finish up. That's fantastic. I'm almost done with the budget. How's everything at the wedding? It's great. It's really nice to see everyone. Great. Well, I'm working like crazy over here. I just wanna make sure that all the materials are available so we can dive in. If we get this we can line up work for years. - Fingers crossed. - OK. - What about... - Have fun. - Hi. - Hi. - So, how are you? - Good. You? Fantastic, yeah. Ava tells me you're seeing someone. That's great. What's his... Awesome. Great. Amazing. I was gonna ask his name. Roger. Roger. Didn't you have like a gerbil or something named... Robert. It was a hamster. That's right, I remember. You used to build him these little houses with beds and cute windows. You were designing even then. So things are good with this guy? Close to perfect. We work together so it's easy. We know each other really well. He's really focused on work. Well, that's good. You always made work a priority so it's good you found someone who does, too. It's great. Really great. I guess it's a choice. You know, some people choose to prioritize work and some people choose to prioritize relationships. I prioritize both. Yeah, I'm just thinking out loud. You know, I just think that, in general, people who prioritize relationships are happier. Well, in general, it's hard to prioritize a relationship when people are so unreliable. I totally agree. By unreliable do you mean not content to sit around and wait for their significant other to pay attention to them? By unreliable I mean someone who, you know, bolts halfway around the world when he feels he's not the sole focus of your life. I never asked to be the sole focus of your life, Lacey. I would have taken less. But sometimes it felt like you couldn't even give me that. So I'm glad you found someone who sees relationships the way you do. Oh, darling, you look radiant. Awe, thanks, mom. Well, hello. Aunt Sarah, hi! You look beautiful. Thank you. May I say a word or two? Of course. You are the hostess of the welcome party. First of all I want to welcome you and thank you all for traveling here during Christmas. It's a tradition in our family to get married on Christmas Eve and to spend their honeymoon in the family cottage. It brings happiness and good fortune to the couple. It's kind of like a family myth. Some believe it, some don't. I'm a believer. I had a wonderful marriage for 34 years and, although George is no longer with us, I feel his love every day. Like me, Ava has always believed in the magic of Christmas. Maybe it's because she watched "It's a Wonderful Life" too many times. To Ava and Mason. May the joy of the Christmas season live in your marriage forever and in your hearts. Cheers. I'll send over the rough specs for the lighting fixtures in an hour, and I'll upload a premium rendering to DropBox and... Lacey, dear, can we have a little talk? In some place a little more quiet. Sure. - I'll call you back. - Good. Let's go in here. You know how special the cottage is. Ava says that you're gonna help decorate. That is so sweet of you to take that on given your tight schedule. Anything for Ava. Well, just remember, it's the traditions. Traditions, yes. I have it all figured out. I ordered these online. Fifteen strands of twinkle lights and ornaments. They're gonna be amazing. They come in a pure white. A bit minimalist. They're different. And bright. But not very colourful. Just remember, Ava loves Christmas. Of course. Lacey. Don't escape to your work just yet. I'm beginning to think that might be impossible. The key to the cottage. Have fun decorating. And think Christmas. I'm going first thing in the morning. What're you doing here? I'm here to help. I don't need your help. Ava asked me to... Decorate, I know. But Mason asked me to help and I can't relinquish my best man duties. So where do we begin? Alright. So the best trees are towards the back. The trees in the barn are pre-cut. Let's just pick out one of those, bring it back to the cottage, decorate it, then I can get back to the hotel and have plenty of time to work. I'm afraid I'm going to have to pull Callaghan family rank on you here, Lacey. It's tradition to cut down our own tree. I'm sure Ava would agree. Fine. I can handle the tree if you need to return business calls. I'm not returning calls. I'm setting a timer for when we need to be finished at the cottage. Very efficient of you. And I'm looking up how to best chop down a Christmas tree. Seriously, Lacey, I got this. No. Why not? Because you're gonna choose some misshapen... Original. Unique. Asymmetrical. Non-conformist. A little on the wild side. Shrub. That's a low blow, you know. I just want it to be perfect for Ava. Well, you know what they say. If you want something done right... You pick a tree and I'll start sawing. This one. It's perfect. And I'll do the sawing. This e-how video got five stars. Cutting down a tree in two minutes flat. You are nothing if not efficient. Are you sure you don't want my help? Positive. Because I'm pretty good at this kind of thing. I'm on a schedule here, Ean. What's your schedule for this tree? Well, it should be down in a few seconds and we'll take it home and decorate it... Lacey, the tree's about to fall. I told you my method was efficient. No, it's about to fall on you. Well, now that it's down what do we do with it? You sure you don't wanna YouTube it? OK, let's pick up some firewood while we're here, take it back and decorate it. Let's get some food first. We don't have time to eat, Ean. It's not for us, it's for Ava and Mason at the cottage. Believe it or not, most human beings can't survive on ambition alone. OK, let's dive in. We have a lot of work to do. Hey, we'll get it done before the day of the wedding. I was hoping we'd have it done in a couple hours. I have to work. I'll put the food away if you can put the Christmas tree up. Deal. What's that? Christmas lights. In pure white. It's a clean, bright look. It's supposed to suggest a forest. Kinda bland, don't you think? Just plain white? I have a vision of a brightly lit winter wonderland. No. I vaguely recall you having a vision of a toboggan one winter that required me to duct tape two cookie sheets and a roasting pan together. In other words, your vision means my labour. And this looks like it's gonna require a lot of extension cords. Nope, no, I got it. Please. Spare me the e-how this time. I'll get the cords. Yeah. This place could use a freshening up. It doesn't get used as much as it used to. Yeah. And I don't think you should start a married life surrounded by dust. No, I'll tell you what. I will turn on the water to clear all the pipes and then we should clean the fireplace. - OK. - OK. What... I opened the flue. I... Oh, Lacey. Don't you remember that thing's been broken for years. I can't believe I did this. Hey, it's OK. I will handle this mess while you clean up, and then we'll decorate, alright? OK. Thank you. I can't reach. It's perfect. Not yet. What are those? Christmas ornaments. Old family Christmas ornaments. Ean, the tree's already done. The colours are perfect. There are no colours. Well, technically there are. There's eggshell and Chantilly and solar. That's so boring. You say boring, I say sophisticated. Lacey, these ornaments mean something to my family. We keep them up here so we can put them on the Christmas cottage tree every year. OK, can't you just cede to my expertise this one time? Honestly, Ean, people pay me a lot of money for my design sense. For my vision. OK. OK. But this place is about tradition. It's about memories and family and warmth and connection. Besides, this is about Ava and what she wants and I'm pretty sure if she was given the choice between Christmas elegance and Christmas explosion she would probably choose... Christmas explosion. Fine, fine, we'll put up a few. For Ava. Great. OK, let's start with... this guy. Well, there's snow in the forecast. Looks like you're gonna get your white Christmas. That's so great. I should text Lacey though and let her know. Those roads can get pretty slippery. Good idea. Look. Our first Christmas at the cottage. Awe, that was so fun. You should probably put it back in the box. It might be awkward having it on the tree. Yeah, I just thought you might like to see it. Well, design school sure paid off for you. Speaking of, I should get back to the hotel. I have some drawings that are due tonight. Looks like we're getting out of here just in time. Actually we're not. What does that mean? It means we're snowed in. No. Looks like we're spending the night here tonight. There's gotta be an open road somewhere. I need to get to my computer. Lacey, there's only one road up to the cottage. Look, hopefully the roads will be open in the morning but there's nothing we can do about it so let's just relax. But I blocked out this time to work. So then work. You used to draw amazing designs freehand. Roger's calling. He is gonna stress if he knows I can't get the blueprints in tonight. Kinda like you're stressing right now? Maybe you two are a good pair. Please. Just go be invisible, OK? Roger. How are you? I'm great. How are you? Or, rather, where are you? It looks like you're standing in a closet. I'm at the cottage. The one I told you about? - It's been in Ava's family for... - Right. Right. Hey, how are the designs coming? They look good. They should be done soon and... Oh, no. A call's coming in. I have to take this. Everyone's gone for the holidays. Can't wait to see you. Now do you see why I need to get to my laptop? I have to have these designs in before the wedding. My whole firm's future is riding on this. Well, I can't help with that but what I can say is that freaking out about it while you're snowed in isn't gonna help. Let's just try to relax. I found these extra pajamas. Go put those on. We'll have a good night's sleep and we'll be good to go in the morning. Thank you. I forgot how beautiful it is here. Yeah. You know, Ava might be half right about this cottage and the family myth. There's something magical about this place. To the Christmas cottage. We're gonna eat through all the gourmet snacks you picked out. We can always restock. Besides, might as well make the best of it. So why didn't you tell Roger the truth? That we're stranded in a blizzard and you don't have your computer? This deal is everything. We're getting work because people anticipate us landing it. Enough work to keep our staff employed for years. What's the project? It's a new housing development. I designed a concept house that we were hoping they'd buy and build. The deal could be worth millions for the firm. What's the concept? It's a live work space but for the suburbs. Taking down the walls between professional space and personal space. Integration that kinda thing. So basically you'll be at work even when you're at home? Precisely. That sounds... awful. I don't think you are our target customer. Well... Maybe we should turn in. Yeah. Why don't you take the bedroom and I will take the couch? No, I'm fine on the couch. You... Please. I'm... Well, no power means no heat. Looks like we're both in front of the fire tonight. I'll get some blankets. OK. Alright, pick a couch. Thanks. This reminds me of camping. You know, I was just thinking the same thing. I remember trying to light a fire in the rain. Do you also remember fishing for our dinner and only coming up with... Two frogs and a branch? Yeah. Those were some of the craziest, coldest, most sleepless and best vacations I ever took. Yeah, me too. I really wish we could have taken that trip I planned for us to the Caribbean. I worked back-to-back weekends for months to earn enough and... I had to cancel because I got a summer internship in New York. Yeah. I was disappointed, but I supported your decision. If that's what you remember. I'm sorry if I made you feel bad about taking that internship. No, it was a good thing. We just weren't meant to be together. Lacey, it wasn't you. I just wasn't ready to settle down in one job in one place for the rest of my life. I know. It was pretty apparent when you accepted a job 3,000 miles away without even telling me you applied for it. We just wanted different things, Ean. Good night. Hey. The power came back on. Just in time for the most important meal of the day. I haven't had an Ean Callaghan breakfast in a long time. Well, then prepare to be amazed. Yum. Looks great. You always knew the way to a woman's heart was through her taste buds. Well, that is the real reason I became a chef. It was a shameless way to impress the ladies. Well, it worked. I am amazed. I'll never understand why you didn't take the job at Les Bernadette. It was a three-star restaurant. I was young. I had wanderlust. I believed that any true chef needed to go to these places where various cuisines were developed. In order to understand the food you need to understand the culture. I remember such grand pronouncements. But now making a meal for one single appreciative... Wildly appreciative. ...Person, feels pretty great, too. - Do you want some coffee? - Yeah. Consider it my Christmas blend. No, no, no, no! We should probably get going. - We have our dress fittings. - Right. And Ava will freak if we're late. I thought I heard some ploughs last night so the roads should be clear. Eat up. We'll get you back to the lodge in no time. Oh my gosh! You look so beautiful. Doesn't she look great? It looks great. OK, are you ready? Yeah. I'm so sorry that happened to you. Was it horribly awkward? Was what awkward? Being stuck with Ean all night? No, no. It was fine. It was fun, even. OK, I know you've been dreading this moment and that bright colour isn't your thing, but... I like it. Really? Actually, I love it. Good! What is going on with you? What do you mean? You just seem so happy and light. It's Christmas. It's your wedding. What's not to be happy about? OK, try it on. - It looks really good. - Yeah. Yeah, it's perfect. I'm so excited! You look so handsome. I'm so happy that they did such a good job tailoring this. Please tell me I don't look silly in this dress. Are you kidding me? You look gorgeous. I never did learn how to tie these. Neither could my dad. Fortunately, I got quite good at it. I've been doing it for him since I was ten. Really? Mason. Do you see what I see? Lacey and Ean. They look so happy. They do. So, as you all know, when Mason and I do our first dance together we'd like for all of you to join us. We'll dance in the centre and then we'll first be joined by the maid of honour and our best man. And then the rest of you will circle around us. Should we give it a try? Yeah. OK. Ready, OK. Good job, honey. Thank you. I'm sorry. I still got two left feet. It's OK, we all do, honey. That's why we're rehearsing now. OK. I've never seen a more perfect pair on the dance floor. You guys are good. Sorry to steal you away from the fun. I'm happy to be stolen. I miss talking to you. Me too. You know, I don't get to travel very much anymore but I still love to hear about life in San Francisco. I think you might still have some big city partying in you. I realized a long time ago where my home was. It's a gift. To know where you belong and with whom. You're talking about Roger? So, is that where you belong? With this new boyfriend, in San Francisco? Yeah, I think it is. Well, that's wonderful, Lacey. But, you know, coming back here makes me think about different things. Different paths I might have taken. There's something about Christmas that always makes people re-examine their lives. Why is that? Human nature, I guess. We get to see the choices other people made and wonder if we're going down the right path. But I will tell you this. When someone has a genuine smile on her face that's usually a good sign that she's on the right path. Ava. What's up? Nothing. Can I come in? Yes. OK, I've known you too long. What's going on in that busy mind of yours? OK, I don't want to interfere or be insensitive to your relationship with Roger in any way. You and Ean. Don't deny it. I was there when you guys were together and that's exactly what it looked like today. Look, it's really nice to see him again and we're actually having more fun than I thought we would. I guess the Christmas cottage myth isn't as loony as you thought. You guys spent a night together and now... We're not having true love forever more, OK? We're just two exes that are having a nice time together. OK. It's just, seeing you guys so happy again, especially when I thought you weren't gonna get along at all, was really nice. It's like an early Christmas present. - Hey. - Hi. Look, I know you're busy working but everyone needs sustenance. Can I cook you lunch? Sure. - It smells incredible. - Well, I went all out. I almost felt like I owed you for being my test subject through school. We were broke students. You were working with oodles of noodles. As I recall, you worked wonders. You remember our first Christmas together? Yes, you made a Yorkshire pudding in a toaster oven. And I'm pretty sure we ate about two pounds of ribbon candy that night. Tonight, however, I have for you, a miso-glazed turkey with roasted yams, gochujang green beans, and a five-spice gravy. Now, I need your honest opinion. Honestly, I would elope with this plate if I could. Can I let you in on a little secret? I haven't spent a Christmas with my family in years. Being back here where we spent so many Christmases as kids... Are you getting nostalgic? Worse. I've been thinking about doing something that I swore to myself I never would. Put down some roots back home. Ean Callaghan. "Put down roots" are three words that I never thought I would hear you say. Seriously though? Are you sure that's what you wanna do? No, I'm not sure at all. But it's something that I'm open to. I've just been thinking about what it would be like to be closer to home. To my family. People I love. And then I figured out what it would be like to cook the same ten dishes every day for the rest of my life and I do things like apply for jobs in Finland and start immediately after Christmas. Still, the thought of having my own place is pretty appealing. OK, what if... you could have a different menu every week? Limited, but different. A pop-up restaurant that's always in the same place. I can do pop-up Indian or pop-up Brazilian. Exactly. It could be a small place, manageable crowds, warm, welcoming, adventurous. Just like you. People would love it. That looks really cool. Ean's Cafe. We can work on the name. We can? Well, you can. See? This is the Lacey I remember. Just drawing from her heart. It's terrific to see. Wait until it's finished. OK. What's that? This is my very famous Christmas dessert. A Cranberry gingerbread souffle with bourbon molasses sauce. And to think I was expecting a simple cobbler. It smells heavenly. Well, if I did it right it should taste even better. You did it right. You should get a spoon so I don't eat it all myself. OK. Do you think you could make another one of these? If you'll eat it, I'll make it. I wish we could but we should probably get back to the cottage and finish up for Ava. And we need to restock. Right. Right. Maybe we could stop by and grab a cider on the way. I know this place that makes a mean gingerbread cider. Sounds amazing. So, what's it like living in so many places? It was exhilarating. A lot of time I'd show up to a new place and I wouldn't have any kind of plan at all. That would drive me crazy. It's actually kinda great. It would allow me to discover all kinds of new things. I would wander down random paths or visit these remote towns and that's always when I would find something special. Actually sounds kinda nice. Nowhere you have to be, nothing you have to do. I can see the appeal of that. - Well, you should try it sometime. - What do you mean? Something you've never done. There's always something to discover, you just gotta be willing to look. Something you've never done? Something I've never done. These wreathes are amazing. Thank you. Well, I learned how to do this from my mother. Would you like to try? I know you've got work to do. No, no, let's build some Christmas wreathes. Hey. Let's make some wreathes. Come on. I've never done this before. That's why they call it an adventure. Start here, take a few boughs. You know, you could put that in your portfolio. Very funny. It's harder than it looks. You did a lovely job. See? I did a lovely job. It's perfect. Really special. Thank you. That was amazing. That's the most fun I've had in a long time. Well, you should let loose more often. You know what? There's a tree-lighting tonight. That's right. I haven't been to one of those in years. Neither have I. But, if my memory serves me correctly, they put on quite a show. Let's go. OK, deal. I should be able to have my drawings finished by then. We can drink hot chocolate and sing carols. I don't think I've seen you this happy since I got here. It feels like I'm looking at the old Lacey again. Say "cheese". You know what? You are just so full of Christmas cheer right now that I think it's time you meet Santa. I don't know if I'm ready for Santa. I think you are. Come on. Say "cheese". Santa. Hi, Santa. Cheese. Lacey. Roger. - You're here early. - I know. I had an idea about our Pine Bay presentation. Great. You could have called. You didn't have to come a day early. No, this is... this is big. Roger Whistler. Lacey's boyfriend. Ean Callaghan. I'm the bride's brother and best man. Right. I've heard about you. In the flesh. So I'm gonna get checked in. I pre-booked the study so you can meet me in there. Great. You are gonna love what I'm thinking. Looks like I really do need to work now. Yeah. Yeah, I get it. Good luck. Thanks. Wait for me to finish the cottage. Sure. So just go with me on this. I was thinking about Pine Bay and how we can make Quinn & Whistler's presentation really stand out. OK. We're gonna build a model of your drawings. Exactly like the ones that we used to do in design school. I love building models but... And then we'll have it at the presentation. Lacey, come on. You know how clients react to actual tangible objects. This is what could cinch it for us. We just... we have to dive in. OK. Let's get started. There she is. What's this? It's a Christmas tree. It makes it more homey. Homey. And a fireplace makes it look more lived-in, like there's actually life inside these walls. You do remember we're not selling a home, right? We're selling a live-work space. Exactly. And I think that that can be enhanced by adding small details to show more of the lived space. How about a compromise? A hint of Christmas, a hint of home. What's wrong? I just don't know if this design works anymore. It feels so empty. You're just getting cold feet. On the home stretch. Shake it off. You're right. I'm gonna do a coffee run. Perfect. I'll take a double espresso. You left work behind. Everyone needs caffeine sometimes. What're you doing with those stockings? I saw these at a kiosk over there and I had to get them for Ava and Mason. I was gonna bring them up to the cottage when we go back in the morning. There's nothing like a stocking full of candy on Christmas morning. Unless, of course, the designer has any objections. No. No, not at all. That's a great idea. Maybe you could come help me. I mean, if you're not too busy. - The place looks beautiful right now. - I would love to. Well, I should get back. Hey. Don't forget about the tree-lighting tonight. It's the last big event before Christmas. Ean, I'm not sure I'm gonna make it. You can't miss it. Come on, it signals that Christmas is almost here. Which, in this town, is full-on Whoville. I would love to, but... duty calls. Really, we have so much work to do if we're gonna get this contract. I understand. Well, I don't. Come on, Lacey. Don't you remember how much fun we had at the tree-lighting when we were little? Yeah, come on. It's gonna be a lot of fun. Come on, Ava. She has to work. She also has to be my maid of honour. The whole wedding party is going. Come on, you can't miss it. Please? Ava, I'm sorry. I wish I could. Can't Roger work while you go to the tree-lighting? It's just that I never get to see you anymore. And if you can't, I understand. But I would really like it if my best friend was there, too. I will try my best. I'll keep my fingers crossed that you do. Bye. It's supposed to be all white on the inside walls. No colour. You're right. I'm just... trying to find a way to warm it up. To make it more of a home. Are you kidding? This is the perfect home for people like us. That's who the customer is. You know, the tree-lighting is tonight. Yeah, I never understood that. Somebody plugs in a tree and then everyone claps. It's about community, being together. It's full-on Whoville. It might be kinda fun. Maybe for some people. When I was a kid I used to love it. I felt like Christmas was officially here as soon as the tree downtown was lit. Sounds like you really wanna go to this tree-lighting thing. No, it's just nostalgia. I haven't been in years. You know what? I think I actually might go. Lacey... It won't take long, I can finish this when I get back. You know, I kinda forgot how much I enjoy the holidays. Do you wanna come? It might be fun. No thanks, I'm good. I'll see you later. You're being very weird. Very, very weird. - You're here! - Yeah, I made it. And it's Christmas. Someone's getting into the spirit of the season. - Where's Roger? - He's still working. I'm gonna finish my end when I get back. I'm so glad you're here. - You made it. - Yeah, yeah. It's been a long time since I've been to something like this. Well I'll have to get another hot chocolate. We can share. OK. Thank you. Hey. - I got whipped cream on my nose. - Yes. But for what it's worth you wear dairy products very well. You know, I've always had a hard time saying no to good desserts. That's something I've always admired about you. So, do you still think that I'm crazy for believing the Christmas cottage myth? Yes. I do. I do. But only 'cause Lacey's already told you she's not in love with Ean again. I know, but they just look so happy together. Is it so wrong to hope? Attention, everyone. We're about to start the tree-lighting. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. So, should we go grab a night cap? Or we could go sit by the fire. Or we could go for a spin around the dance floor. Come on, we need to practice if we're not gonna get shown up by Fred and Ginger here. - Sure. - Yeah. Sounds good. OK. I'm really glad you came to the tree-lighting. Ava would have been crushed. I would have been crushed. You know, it's funny. In all the traveling I've done it's always the things I don't do, the places I don't go to that I end up regretting the most. Sounds like a good life philosophy. What's one of the best things you've done? Ooh, in the exciting world of cooking? Well, let's see. OK, I have julienned vegetables using a hand made hatchet. I have sauteed sun chokes using clay cooking pots and I have even harvested my own indigo milk cap mushrooms. That is exciting. Mostly it was just a bunch of hiking. This is your favourite Christmas song. You remembered. How could I forget? You played it on a loop for 24 hours every Thanksgiving. I think the best Christmases I had were the ones we had together. When we were... Yeah. Yeah, me too. You know what? You know what was my favourite of all time? When you bought me my first professional chef's knife. I spent my whole bank account on that. But it was worth it. Roger. You're here. I had no idea you were such a good dancer. That was hardly good dancing. Well, I finished work and thought that we could grab some dinner. Right, of course. You finished up already? That's great. Yeah. Roger. So glad you could make it out. Lacey's told us how hard you guys have been working. Even workaholics need food sometimes. And take a little time off work. Well, Mason and I were just gonna head out to the fire pit. Yeah. We're making some s'mores. Great. We should all go. You know what? I'm feeling kinda tired. I might just head up to bed. Really? You're gonna pass up s'mores? I am, yeah. But you go enjoy. I know how you are about your desserts. We'll see you guys in the morning? Good night. OK. Hi. Hey. What's up? That was so great last night. Yeah. You know, I forgot how good of a dancer you are. Are we going to the cottage? You still wanna come? Because if you're busy with work I can... I can handle it. No, I'd love to go. I want it to be perfect for Ava and Mason. Me too. Well, your chariot awaits. Thank you. Now that is a glorious sight. So, any great ideas for finishing touches before we leave? It looks just about perfect to me. It is perfect. Except for one thing. I was hoping we could try a little honesty. What do you mean? Do you mind? I'm talking about us. Whatever's going on between us. Come on, I know you're feeling it, too. Maybe, a bit. A bit? Ean, I don't know what it is. Maybe it's being back here at the cottage. It's so magical and filled with warmth and good memories. We had so many good times here. Had so many good times? What about are having good times? Ean, it's great to see you again, really, but that's all it is. Well, I'm sorry. I just... I thought things were different between us, or that maybe they were going in that direction. I have a life with Roger. A life that we've built over months of hard work. I... I can't just give up on that. Lacey, are you talking about Roger or your career? Because they aren't the same thing. I'm sorry, Ean. I think we just got caught up in the feelings of the cottage. That's all. That's not all it is for me. Being back here hasn't just brought back memories, it's brought back feelings which, if I'm being honest with myself, have been there all along. Don't. I think maybe all the fun we've been having has just... it's just lead to some confusion. Confusion? No. No, not at all. Right now I'm the opposite of confused. In fact I don't think I've been so clear-headed in a long time. You know, the last few years that I've been country-hopping, there's always been this... this thing that I couldn't get away from no matter how far I went. And that's you. No matter where I was I couldn't figure out why I couldn't get rid of you until I saw you back here again. And that's when I knew. It's because you'll always be in my heart, no matter where I am. I guess it's just my luck that you don't feel the same way. Once again we want different things. - Ean, I... - No. It's OK. You have Roger and I'm sorry. We should head back. Hey. What's up? I just talked to Pine Bay. I told them that we're bringing in a model for our presentation and they loved it. They wanna see us right after Christmas. Lacey, this could be it. Everything that we hoped for. That's great. Roger, I... Open it. A celebration gift to the best partner a guy could ever have. Let's go enjoy the rehearsal dinner. It'll be the first time we've had dinner together in a long time. Well, I'm just so glad you could make it. No, I know, I know. She really hasn't stopped talking about it. Isn't that right? After dinner tonight let's go somewhere we've never been, do something we've never done. Why? I just wanna do something together that isn't about work. Maybe something spontaneous and fun? That sounds great. I just don't think right now is the time for spontaneous and fun. We are so close to landing Pine Bay. Roger, I just wanna talk with you about something other than clients and design for the next year. That's all we talk about. That's the only thing we connect over anymore. Try not to get whiplash before my wedding. What do you mean? Ean, I'm your sister. And a woman raised on a steady diet of romance novels. I think I know what's going on. I have no idea what's going on in your mind. The only thing I'm thinking about is if I'm gonna take my next overseas job. I might have to leave pretty soon. I was hoping to spend more time back home. I don't get here very often. So stay. Tell them no. - It's not that simple. - It is that simple. You just have to be ready. Ready for what? Ready to stop running away from your problems. Ready to stay and fight for what you want. I don't know what you're talking about. Besides, if it's romance you want I don't think it gets much more romantic than those two. You know, for a smart guy, you really say some seriously dense things. Wha... I just want balance in my life. And in our relationship. I want work to end when we leave the office and not follow us through the holidays and to weddings - ... and family events and... - OK. I hear you. I just... I see it differently. Lacey, right now we have this opportunity that might not happen again for a really long time. We can't take our foot off the gas. We can always scale back. Later. I promise. Looks like those old sketches you used to do in grad school. That's because I drew it. I drew it for Ean but I guess he doesn't want it anymore. Let's go. We should probably head upstairs and get packed. I had to change our flights to tomorrow night after the wedding. A red-eye on Christmas Eve? Plane will be empty. We can do all our work on there. Lacey, after Pine Bay is done I promise you the best belated Christmas ever. Scout's honour. I wasn't a scout. Come on, let's go get packed. I'm being called outside. Maid of honour duties. OK. - I'll see you in a bit. - Yeah. Thank you. Can I ply you with hot chocolate? Get in here. We're flying out tomorrow. Right after the wedding. We're set to present our plans the day after Christmas. Congratulations? We've worked so hard to get this far and we should both be so excited but I'm just... I'm not. It's like something changed in me. Do you think it has anything to do with seeing Ean again? Maybe. I think seeing him is like looking into a window of the past. I spent so much time thinking about what went wrong between us, I kinda forgot how right things were at one point, too. Well, relationships change. Maybe there's some version of your old relationship that you can have now, like friends even. Sure. Friends. But not really. My life is so different in San Francisco. And he's still traveling. I think our time together is done. Well, it sounds like that's hard for you to say. You can't get back what you had with someone. Yeah, but technically you get back some version of it. Technically I agree. But I don't think that's gonna happen with me and Ean. He brought up the idea of getting back together. I said no. But I think once Roger and I get home and we get back into our routine I'll realize that I made the right decision. Well, if that is your Christmas wish then I hope it happens for you. You're still gonna be telling me fairy tales when we're little old ladies. Because I believe in the magic of the season and I don't think it's done with this yet. I'll see you later? - Good night. - Good night. It gives me great joy this holiday season to join Ava and Mason as husband and wife. May they have many happy holidays together. By the power vested in me, I have the honour this Christmas season to pronounce... Ava and Mason husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. The wedding was beautiful. They both look so happy. Yeah. Did you get all your work done? I did. Congratulations. Just one more meeting when we get back. You must be very happy. Very. What about the restaurant? Have you thought more about it? That was a pipe dream. Nothing more. Besides, I accepted that job in Finland. You did? I leave first thing in the morning. And now we would like the rest of the wedding party to join us on the dance floor, please. Just be yourself. I guess it's time to start the toasts and subject you all to my very amateur thoughts on life and love. I hope he talks fast. You still need to pack for the flight tonight. I've had a lot of time these past few days to think about what makes a good relationship. One that lasts, one that can survive the hard times and the inevitable disagreements, and for a moment there I thought maybe it's just sheer determination. What makes a love that lasts? I know you're probably thinking if I had the answer to that question I would be a very rich man. Well, get out your wallets because I think I have at least part of that answer. Real love is about knowing someone so well they feel like an extension of yourself. You share each other's hopes and dreams, even if they aren't exactly your own. You love and accept each other exactly as you are without asking them to change, and you always put each other first, naturally and effortlessly. There's a part of us that most people take for granted but then there's a part of us that only a few people ever really get to know. I believe that true love is about loving that part, too. So, to Ava and Mason, for loving all sides of each other, naturally and effortlessly. First, Ava and Mason, thank you for an amazing few days and the best Christmas that I've had in a while. Your love and your relationship are truly an inspiration. I think at Christmas people take a step back and think about what's really important, and it always becomes clear. Friends, family, and love. But Ava and Mason have got me doing a lot of thinking about love and relationship over the last few days. I thought I knew. I thought I had it all figured out. When I got here I would have said that a good relationship is about having the same goals. Striving for the same things, syncing up your priorities. It sounded so simple. But I had forgotten that real love is so much bigger than that. Love isn't simple. It's about disagreeing and agreeing. It's about loving someone enough to care about what they care about, to hope for what they hope for. It's about helping another person live a life that they've always dreamed of. Real love, like Christmas, is about giving. To Ava and Mason. May you always share in each other's hopes and dreams. Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. I don't wanna sound paranoid but am I just being an idiot here? Roger, I'm sorry. That's not the answer I was expecting. So you still have feelings for Ean. No. At the same time, yes. I didn't think that I did. Lacey, ever since we got here I have understood about half the things you're saying. What am I missing? Me. You've lost sight of me. Or maybe we've lost sight of each other. At some point we both put ambition in first place. And that's worked. Yeah, it has. We're a great partnership. A great design team. But? But that can't be all anymore. That can't be all we are for another year or another month. I won't wait. I can't wait for happiness or love. We both deserve that. Well, I'd ask you what you were gonna do but I think I know what you're gonna say. Roger, I'm sorry. Me too. Let's do what we do best. Let's be a design team. That's where we're still strong. That's what we have in common. The other parts of a relationship, they just got away from us. And Pine Bay? We're still going forward with that? You think I put in 18 hours a day to walk away from my first multi-million dollar contract? Thank goodness. But Roger, after this project, I wanna bring balance into the firm. Meaning? Meaning I don't only want to design sleek spaces for corporations. I wanna work on personal projects. I wanna work with clients again, get to know them as people. Help them realize their visions. There was a time in grad school when we both wanted that. There was also a time in grad school when we drank instant coffee and ate cold pizza. Sounds good to me. You have really found a new part of yourself here. Push the meeting until the new year. - I don't know. - Our design is worth waiting for. OK. I'll see you back at the office. After I've celebrated Christmas. Lacey dear, what a wonderful toast you gave. Thank you. You and Ean both. Have you seen him? I think he left for the airport already. You know he took another job abroad? He told me, but he left so soon? I think he's spending the night at the airport hotel. He leaves tomorrow first thing in the morning. You know, it's funny, just yesterday he was talking about coming home again and putting down some real roots. I guess he'll always be a traveller at heart. Would you like to join me? Yes. I wanted to take a break from the noise of the party. Why the long face, Lacey? Well, let's see. I'm about to land the biggest client of my career right at the point where I wanna spend more time outside the office. More time for myself and the people I care about. And for the first time in years I feel like I'm in love. But it's too late. It's not feeling like a very merry Christmas. And I can't help thinking that maybe there is something about the cottage that brought Ean and me back together, but I messed it up. Well, I don't know about that. But I do know that the only magic at the cottage is the magic of Christmas. The magic of togetherness. It's a special place. And you were right. It's the traditions, the memories that make it that way. It is. I'm going to turn in. I'll see you at the breakfast. Oh, Lacey dear? One more favour. You need to take these presents up to the cottage. Presents for the bride and groom must be under the Christmas tree on Christmas morning. Of course. Hi. What're you doing here? Aunt Sarah asked me for a favour. She wanted the fire going and the champagne chilling for Ava and Mason. They should be here in about an hour. But I guess I kinda wanted to come back here one more time to just be here and remember all the good times we had. Me too. Ava tells me you're flying out tonight? I'm not. Not anymore. Don't you have some big important meeting... It can wait. I... I broke up with Roger. What? I was listening to your toast and I realized that Roger doesn't know all the different sides of me. He only knows one. But I realized that I need more than work to be happy. I want love and relationship and family. That sounds pretty doable to me. And I know you say you don't wanna open your own restaurant and I know that you're traveling and that you're gonna leave and... - Lacey, I... - I know that you're upset with me. Why would you think that? I saw the drawing that you tossed. And it's fine. I just... I want you to know that the person you've been with for the last few days? She's back for good. And she'll be here when you get back from Finland or wherever it is you need to travel to. I want you back in my life. I didn't toss it, I dropped it. But then I went back for it. This design, this vision, is beautiful. So is the woman who drew it. And I'm never gonna leave her behind again. I've always loved you, Lacey. I love you, too. - You can answer that if you... - No. I don't want anything to come between us right now. You know, maybe this place really is magic. What about Finland? I'm not going on that trip anymore. I've got another adventure planned. Maybe that old family myth is true after all.
