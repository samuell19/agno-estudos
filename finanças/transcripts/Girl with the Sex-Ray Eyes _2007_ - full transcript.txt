[MUSIC PLAYING] Are you sure you brought enough? It's all there. So you get two treats today? Lucky boy. One for me, one for my Uncle Sam. Choose wisely. What's in that case holds great power. I'm a company man I've never been tempted to turn. I too am always willing to take one for the team. You know, I've often thought that you and I could make a great team, an international co-production. I'm not sure my bosses would go for that arrangement, but it is nice to run into you every now and again. Yes, we do have nice run-ins. I suggest you take some of that money and get out of town. Oh, I intend to. Ciao, baby. Bye. [KNOCKS SOFTLY] So, this is what they look like. Like something a kid would wear, sir. That's the beauty of it, simplicity itself. Who would ever suspect that these would actually work? And the degree to which they work. In the wrong hands, this could have gone very badly. No secret would be safe. Well, thank God that we found them in time. If they're going to be used, it's going to be for our side. Amen, sir. I trust you did everything you had to, to get this, no serious injuries? No, sir, a little drained, but other than that, just fine. All we have to do is get these to the lab for final analysis before we can begin production on cloning them. My travel papers are in order, sir. Good. I await your final report. Thank you, sir. Oh! Oh! Oh, gosh. I'm sorry. I must not have seen you. No, no, no. It is my fault, here. I'm Taffy. Taffy. Because I'm so sweet. What's your name? Can't tell you that, Miss. You have business here? Huh? Bachelor party at 5:00 PM. You might want to check that address. This is the federal building. The federal building? Yes, ma'am. Not much chance of that happening around here. Oh, no. Wrong address? Wrong address, wrong time, wrong town. Sorry, Taffy. Guess you missed your appointment, huh? Well, I guess I'll just head home. Better luck next time. Wow, you're home early. I screwed up. Again? I must be like dyspeptic or something. I can never seem to get anything right. Don't say that. You do plenty right. Let me help you with some of these bags. What's in this? Why? Too heavy? No, too light. Whoa. These are yours? You certainly aren't wearing much for your shows these days. Don't be silly. Those aren't mine. Well then whose are they? Oh. They must belong to that nice man outside of the federal building. We ran into each other. And, you don't think our bags could've gotten mixed up, do you? Taffy. I can see you naked. Maybe later. Right now, we need to figure out who these belong to. No, really. These things really work. What really work? X-ray glasses, baby. Check them out. Whoa! Ooh, kids would have a blast with these. Yeah. Well, at least you know what you're buying. Yeah, I'd like a pound of whatever you're selling. I'd like a pound of Taffy. Eddie, you always know how to cheer me up. But seriously, what do we do with these? Who cares? Keep them for your next show. That way, you'll know how much dough a guy's got in his pockets. You're so smart. Yeah. Should I wear these? No, I'll give you something else to look at. Yeah? Oh, Eddie. Let me look, let me look. Come on. [MOANING] Oh, boy, don't need x-ray glasses for that. [MOANING] So sweet, Taffy. Where did we put those glasses? This is not an option. I paid a great deal of money for those glasses and I'm not in the mood to hear that your operative is settled elsewhere for a larger share. This is not how business is conducted. You think I'm making idle threats? Wait and see. Largo! Mao Myx. How may I endear myself to you? My X-ray glasses have been stolen out from under our very noses. I have a buyer for those glasses who paid a great deal of money in advance for their possession. I must get those glasses back and soon. Where does the trail begin? Start with Natasha Rubikoff. She double crossed me and sold them to another party. She must be made to talk. I need to know who she sold them to. You know what to do. Of course. Good, she's a prisoner down in the dungeon. How convenient. You bet your ass it is. Now go. This is grave news indeed. Indeed. I cannot tell you how sorry I am that this happened, sir. The fate of democracy hangs in the very balanced, Richardson. Mr. Thompson, I absolutely understand the perilous position my blunder has placed this country. You have 48 hours to set things right. I understand, sir. I'm on it. Any leads? A stripper named Taffy. She does bachelor parties. Well, at least that's something to go on. You have everything you need? I have 50 $1 bills, sir. That should be enough to get any stripper talking. Well, good luck, Godspeed. Thank you, sir. This is so cool. Oh, I can see the prize in the bottom of the cereal box. Oh, I can see the yolks in the eggs. [SCREECH] There's a mouse behind the fridge. OK, OK. Don't worry. I'll take care of that. And who's phone number is that in your pocket? Huh? Hey, we got to figure out what we're going to do with these things. Well, we could try to give them back. They're probably real important. Maybe, but not just yet. Oh, I know. We could seem them on eBay. That's not bad. But, if we take them to Vegas, we'd be a shoo-in at blackjack or poker. We'd be rich! Do we dare? We dare. Let's get packing. Ah! So, finally, they sent the dreaded torturer Largo to extract Mao Myx's revenge. Don't be so hasty, Natasha. I have no intention of harming you. By now Mao Myx is already on the trail of her missing property and I have a feeling her mission will be a successful one. Is that so? Then why are you not here to kill me? I have outlived my usefulness. Mao Myx has special plans for you. She intends to trade you for something that she wants. But in the meantime, tell me the name of the operative you sold the X-ray glasses to? Why should you need that information now? Mao Myx likes to know who her enemies are and be thankful that you're not one of them. If I tell you, how do I know that you will not kill me? I would never kill anything as lovely as you. Allow me to show you. [MOANING] Hello? Yes, do you do bachelor parties? Excellent. You have a lot of girls? Good. I'm looking for Taffy. No, not that kind of taffy. You have jaw breakers? OK. You have liquor wish sticks? Liquor wish sticks, now that's, that's actually very funny. You have good and plenty? Yeah, I think I saw them last week at the Peppermint Wino. No, I am looking for Taffy. All right, well, I'm sorry it didn't work out. Yeah, maybe I will call off the wedding. Thank you very much. Yes, hello. Do you do bachelor parties? You do, good. Do you have Taffy? I'm looking for Taffy. She's blonde, falls down a lot. You do? Well, yes, it sounds just like her. No, listen, this is Agent-- well, never mind. I can't tell you my name. But your government needs you and-- yes, of course, I'll hold. Thank God. Who knows what evil those glasses might have fallen into in the wrong hands. You guys are winning big tonight. You said it, baby. In fact, we're winning so big, I'd like to spread the wealth, if you're interested in spreading, the wealth, that is. Just might. Got a long weekend coming up. Let the good times roll. That's what I always say, baby. [GROANS] So what do you say? Room service tonight? Yeah, I'm exhausted carrying all this money around sure has wore me out. That sure is a lot of money. Do you think anyone got wise to us? Not a chance. Besides, it's good for people like us to come up winners every once in a while. It makes the little guy think he's got a chance. I guess you're right. I mean, they didn't even blink when we cashed in our chips. No, they didn't, and that's why it's caviar and champagne all the way tonight, baby. Mm, the smell of money makes me wet with desire. But can you afford me? Oh, tonight, I can afford you. [KNOCKING] Come on in. I can afford you and another one just like you. Happy birthday, Taffy. It's not my birthday. I know. Better open up your present before it melts. You dealt me a great hand today. Now I'm going to deal you one. More money. Woo, hoo! Woo! Now, who said it couldn't be done? We're rich, baby, really, really rich. Yeah. Maybe we should sell this place and move uptown. We could start a little bachelor party business of our own. Maybe, but we gotta take it slow. We don't want to attract any attention. You know, all the things I've ever wanted, they're becoming a reality. All thanks to these babies. Sure are. But like I said, we gotta take it easy. Sorry to break up this little party, but I think you have something that belongs to me. Hey, that's the guy I ran into. Quick thinking, Taffy. Looks like you've been taking our glasses out for a little bit of a test drive unofficially of course. Huh? We just got really, really lucky. You know in this instance, I think I'm going to have to agree with you. Now the glasses, if you please. [SIGH] It's probably best if you two just forget about this and maybe we'll overlook your little Las Vegas jaunt. Hey, it was fun while it lasted. Actually, the fun is just beginning. Hands up. Over there, flatfoot. You bring me the glasses. You're never going to get away with this, you fiend. Oh, yeah? That's what they said and we fixed the election in Florida. I knew that. Now we're all going for a little ride. Let's go. Easy, man. Don't go postal. I think we're here to rescue you. So what are you in here for? Road rage. These have taken a very curious route back to me, wouldn't you agree, Largo? I agree, Madam Mao Myx. But now they belong to their rightful owner and you are free to go about with your plans unabated. Yes, and you thought you had beaten me, Agent Richardson. How do you know my name? It matters little now, even as you plotted to seduce Natasha into betraying me, she now suffered the same fate you must all endure. Now what fate would that be exactly? The death of 1,000 scorpions? The agony of 100 knives? Burning and itching an athlete's foot? Silence. I need time to dwell upon these decisions. Such things should not be entered into lightly. Largo, I have need of you in private. Don't go anywhere. [LAUGHS] Don't panic folks. I'll think of something. I'm thinking of something. Yes, sir, Mr. President. I understand the severity of the situation. Well, I have it on very good authority that one of our agents close to recovering the glasses, if he doesn't have them in his possession already. I hope to have them by Friday. Yes, sir, I understand that's your poker night. I will do my best. Yes, sir, Mr. President. Yes. Thank you, sir. Jesus, can't the guy just play one honest game like everyone else? Largo, you always know to make me purr. It is my pleasure to please you. Now, to our captives. It's time to take out the trash as it were. That meddling agent has been a thorn in my side for way too long and the others just know too much. Dispose of them in the usual fashion? The usual fashion? One shot to the head, saw up the bodies, dissolve them in acid lime, then drive-through three states, do-si-do. Back through two states, then bury them, one third each in separate baseball fields, fly to Switzerland, legally change my name, and then return to California, dressed as a woman. Oh, please. Nothing so routine. No, kill the men and sell the women into white slavery. That should bring in enough to at least pay for the Jacuzzi I planned for the back deck. Now, see to it immediately. Drat. Evil suits me. It really suits me. [LAUGHING] Take it easy, psycho, take it easy. Grab him! You did it, baby! Come on, everybody, let's go, let's go. Taffy, come on. I'm sorry, comrade. I go my own way. Catch you in the next Cold War, baby. Yes, I'm very happy to report that the glasses are back in my possession and ready for delivery. Yes, the price is high, very high indeed. But what do you expect? There isn't another pair of X-ray glasses like them in the entire world? Shall I expect to see you later? Excellent. And please bring cash. My bank puts a 10 day hold on checks over $30 million. I look forward to finally meeting you. Gimme me some. Thank goodness we made it. I thought we were goners for sure. We're not out of the woods yet, Taffy. What do you mean? Well, the way I see it is that they know where you live. So they probably think we would never be stupid enough to come back here. That's where they're wrong. Right. Now also, they know we know where they live and what they're up to. So, if we want to have any chance of catching them and foiling them at their evil plans, we're going to have to move quickly. I don't have any hope of catching them or foiling their evil plans. How about you, Taffy, do you? No. Not me. Hey, come on you two. I just saved your lives. Hey, we wouldn't have needed saving if it wasn't for you. True, but if we don't do something, you won't have any place to spend all that money. Really. Right. Think about it. It could happen. Bank vault combinations would become useless, national secrets compromised, lotto tickets would become a thing of the past. Lotto tickets? Yeah, right. Yeah, all right, well, I was stretching on that one. But you get my point. Look, even if we wanted to help you out, what could the two of us do? All right. Intelligence thinks that Mao Myx's buyer is a wealthy Middle Eastern man named Ram Singh. We have not been able to produce a photograph of him, but we don't think Mao Myx has met him either. So I propose one of the two of you, Eddie, impersonate him. Make the buy, get the glasses, bring them home, and we're all heroes. But could such a simple plan have any chance whatsoever of working? I don't have a better plan. Oh, great. [CRACK] INTERCOM: Miss Mao Myx. Yes. INTERCOM: Your guests are arrived. Excellent. Show them in. My dear Ram Singh, how delightful to finally meet you. It is my pleasure. Me too. I see you brought the money. It's all here. It is quite a very, very lot. $30 million is nothing to sneeze at. Indeed. Drink? Yeah, I think we better-- by all means. These X-ray glasses are very sought after and you're very lucky to be able to afford them. Everybody wanted them. Yes, I would like to see them. Of course. My, my, my. Oh, my. They work exceptionally well. I would not have believed it if I did not see it with my very own eyes. My dear Ram Singh, I do believe you're undressing me with your eyes. My glasses, please. My apologies. So, tell me, Ram? What's it like in Moronico? Moronico? Yeah, where you live? Oh, yes, yes, Moronico. Well, it's a terrible place, full of sand and camels and people that wear bed sheets with towels on their head. And oh, my god, the heat. Such heat you would never believe it. Sounds lovely. You must send me a postcard sometime. It does have its moments to be sure. I'll bet. Was it a long journey? Ah, yes, yes, it was way, way over there. My ass almost gave out on the plane ride here. My ass did put out on the way here. No, give out, Yeah, give out. You can remove that silly disguise, Ram Singh, or whatever your name is. Your little game has come to an unfortunate end. You move over there. Come on, move. Ah! Move it. Keep going. You too. Keep moving. Over there, get going, move. Hey, what tipped you off. Well, the real Ram Singh lives in Palm Springs and would never be seen in the company of such a cheap and common harem girl such as this. Hey, I resemble that remark. Well it's too bad that Largo isn't here to take care of you personally. But I have no problems killing both of you myself. Whoa, whoa! Don't you want to know who sent us or who were working for? It's plain, don't you think? You're obvious government agents. They're all such bungling fools you couldn't even find her ass with both hands. That's a lie. Either way, it's sayonara suckers for the two of you. Better luck next time. Hold it. Not so fast, Mao Myx. Hands up. Taffy, grab the glasses. Go. Ooh. To the left, to the right. Right there. Right there. Good thing you showed up. She was about to perforate us. I had a feeling the two of you were going to blow it, so I used you as a diversion to gain access into the mansion. So we were just baiting your cleverly laid trap? Sorry, Taffy. Enough already. Isn't talking something that's against the Geneva Convention? Let's just get on with it. Now what? Here's where Largo creeps in behind you and turns the table on all of you. Very interesting, Mao Myx, but highly unlikely. Hands up. Drop the gun. Ow. Good work, Largo. You will be rewarded. I already have been. You mean? Yes, it's true. Largo is going in business for himself. And the money I make from selling these I intend to buy small string of islands off the coast of Southern Florida and then probably name them after myself. So, you'd betray me. I like to call it diversification. Ah! [SOUNDS OF FIGHTING] [CRASHING] Oh, no. Busted. Oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh dear. There goes my island. There goes Vegas. There goes Bachelor Parties Are Us. Well, I guess there's nothing left to fight about. Guess not. I'm out. I'm good. So I guess we should all just go home. That's a good idea, Taffy. Let's get out of here. Oh, beautiful house. Really, it's lovely. Thanks. Next time. I just wanted to thank the two of you for risking your necks like that. It's fun for about two minutes. Not everybody would have taken the chances that you two did. It's been quite an adventure, man. I mean, finding the X-ray glasses, winning big in Vegas, getting kidnapped, escaping, and finally turning the tables on those evil bastards. Yeah, we've had quite a busy week. And we're grateful for all your help. Ah, it was nothing. I've been authorized by the agency to award the two of you with this small token of your government's appreciation. We'll treasure them forever. Wear them with honor. You can bet on it. Now, for your bachelor party pleasure, we have the sensuous, sweet, and sticky Taffy. Who's phone number is that in your pocket? I don't have any hope of catching them or foiling their evil plans. Oh, Largo, you always know how to make me purr. Fly to Switzerland, legally change my name, and then return to California, dress up as a woman. I don't have a better plan. Choose wisely. What's in that case holds great power. This is great news indeed. I just might. Got a long weekend coming up. Can you turn over for me, please? [MUSIC PLAYING]
