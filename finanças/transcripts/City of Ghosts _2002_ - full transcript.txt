Hurricane Gabriel continues to pound the eastern seaboard. It has now been upgraded to a category 4 hurricane. Forecasters are predicting major damage and severe flooding which we are already seeing in many parts of North Carolina. Later, we go live to a tense scene some 300 miles north where evacuees battle to stock up on food and water. But first, the latest... ...for desperately needed medical aid. Here at Gibraltar Point, we have reports of entire communities being leveled. Gusts as strong as 150 miles per hour strong enough to level homes. Scores of residents have heeded the call and have been pouring into the shelter here at Gibraltar Point all night. The big concern for them is, will they have a home to return to? I don't know what to expect to find when I get back there, but I'm sure we'll be talkingwith the insurance company. Well, we do have insurance, thank God. I expect it'll take time, but you know, eventually, we'll have our house back. We've got insurance, so... The Governor of North Carolina has declared a state of emergency in several... Jimmy, we've got a real mess on our hands. I've been tryingto contact Mr. Nagel, but... Jimmy Cremmins? Yeah, I am. Uh... What's going on here? I'm Agent Burden with the FBI. This is Agent Philips. Can we have a word with you? Sure. AGENT BURDEN: Who's supposed to be in chargeof business operations? He was based overseas. He called nearly every day. I just never... I never met him in person. We'll need you to comedown to the office, uh, answer a few more questions. Let's go over it one more time. I answered an ad... ...in The Tribune. Capable Trust was lookingto fill some positions for... ...hmm, North American headquarters, and... Well, they hired the right guy. You're a hell of a salesman, Jimmy. Were there any other offshore accounts besides the ones in Zurich and the Caymans? No. Not to my knowledge. So they were the accounts you would draw from to pay claims. Right. It's gonna be tough to pay those claims, Jimmy. Those accounts are empty. It's not your fault, of course, but... It is a shame. All those innocent people lost their homes. And you have no idea where we can find this Mr. Nagel? Don't you want to help us, Jimmy? What do you think? Of course I do. Mr. Nagel... The name keeps coming up. He wasn't lying. I ran a check. There was an ad in The Tribuneclassified section last September. What do you think? It's a sophisticatedPonzi scheme like that outfit operatingout of Belgium last year. Selling disaster insurancewith no intentionof paying any claims. I bet the farm, this guyis connected somehow. We just got tokeep on digging. Collect call from United States from Jimmy. I accept. Jimmy, it's Kaspar. Listen. I need to talk to him now. He's unreachable. He's not in Bangkok. He's not in town. He's not in... Well, where is he? Cambodia. That's all I know. But he's supposed to call in. Perhaps I can help. Cambodia? Well, we ran a check on you. You came up clean. We're sorry you hadto go through all this, but... A lot of peoplegot swindled. Even you were misled, so it seems. This investigationis just now getting underway. And we're gonnaneed your cooperationdown the road. Listen, uh... What's gonna happen to the people who lost their homes? That'll be up tothe State Liquidation Bureau. There'll be somekind of compensation, I imagine, but... ...nothing like thosepolicies promised. And what about this Mr. Nagel? Any luck with him? I'm afraid, Mr. Nagel never existed. But when we pinpointwho it is that wasfronting that operation... And we do believeit's someone fromyour office. We'll get Mr. Nagel. It's just a matter of time. Well, we would appreciate itif you'd stick around towntill this thing's resolved. Anything I can do to help. Good. Oh, one more thing. We'd like it if you'd turn over your passport for the time being. Of course you're under no obligation. My passport? That's right. You won't be needing it unless you're planning on leaving the country. No, of course not. Well, good luckwith the investigation. Jimmy, welcome. Hey! It's been a long time. Did you get my message? Yeah. Sure. No trouble at all. Have you been paid any money yet? No. Neither have I. I'm gonna level with you. I think Marvinhas got himselfinto a bit of a jam. With who? With Nevesky and the Russians back in New York. You didn't know? They were our partners. Now they're looking for him. What's he doing in Cambodia? Casino.I don't know much about it. Right. There's someoneI want you to meet. Rocky, come here. Rocky, this is Jimmy.Jimmy, this is Rocky. She's wonderful, isn't she? Rocky. Rocky, no! Rocky. No, no, no. No, no... Huh... We talked about that. We're engaged to be married. Congratulations. She's a bit of a diamond in the raw, you know. I'll make a lady out of her. You should go up to Chiang Mai. It's fantastic up there, bucolic scenery, cheap guesthouses... Kasper. I'm not going up to Chiang Mai. I'm here to see Marvin. Well, he won't be expecting you. Good. It'll be a surprise. He'll be glad to see me. It's been a while. Well, there's two morning flights. If we don't talkbefore you leave, let's meet the day aftertomorrow in Phnom Penh. At noon, at the Belleville. They can getyou a room there as well. Hello? Teddy, it's me, Jimmy. What's your plan? I'm flying out firstthing in the morning. Not so fast.

"I no longer am what I once was, "nor ever shall be again." I don't know what the hell Marvin's up to. You just be careful. Something's changed in him. You can't keep stealing from Peter to pay Paul.

No, he didn't. It was a Khmer. He said he workedfor Marvin. MAN: Who's looking for Marvin? A friend of his. You know where he is? No. But I knowwho he hangs out with. An ex-general named Sideth. And that guy Marvin'sway out of his league. Who are you? It doesn'tmatter who I am. Emile. You want a piece of friendly advice? Go back to whereverit is you came from, and leave those people alone. Emile. Who's Sideth? A bad guy. Anybody else come back here looking for me? I haven't seen anyone. You know, things runon a different clock here. My clock stopped when a B-40 rocket hit my jeep in Mondolkiri. Really? I still got shrapnel in my neck. You can see it. Look. I don't see anything. Maybe you need a pair of glasses. He calls himself"the man of contradictions." But he's a little bit... This place attractthem like flies. Oh, yeah. Yes. I have Calvadosfrom my country. Thanks.Have a glass. What's her story? Sophie?

I'll take these back.Thanks. Hi. Thank you so much for... What happened to your eye? Oh, I was in the wrong placeat the wrong time. Uh-huh, yeah, you seem like that type. Which type?

Tonight for dinner? You know, I can't. I've got plans tonight. Oh. We should go. We're gonna be late. Come on, Robbie. You weren't on the plane. Oh, wow.That's a new look for you. You like it? I can fix you up for one. What happened? I got popped. By who? I don't know. Well, you should be gratefulmoney's all they wanted. You're luckyone of your kidneysisn't lying at the bottomof somebody's ice chest. They didn't take my money. No? Does Marvin know where I'm staying? Well, you can ask himwhen you see him. I hate this country. Hey, Jimmy boy. Oh, shit. Oh. It's good to see you.Yeah. So, come on. What do you think of the layout? You know, this is the old governor's residence. Do you like it? It could do witha fresh coat of paint. The whole country needs a paint job. But that's part of its charm. Yeah. I need to talk to Jimmy alone for a second. You want to wait outside? Oh, yeah. Sure. That was some placeyou sent me to yesterday. I got your note. What note? The one you left at the Belleville. I didn't leave you any note. No? No. What are you doing here? I thought you wanted to see me. I, what? I thought you wanted to see me. I'll call you if I want to see you. Go.Good-bye. I have themboil everything, food, water. Even the bed sheets and the tablecloth. 85 % of the people on the planet are infested with some kind of microscopic bug. Now, with stats like that, you know, you can't be too careful. You were supposed to stay put until you heard from me. Yeah, well... The Feds were all over me. I had to get away. Forget it. Spilled milk. And you, uh, did an excellent job.I'm very proud of you, Jimmy. I think in some ways you're better off here. I mean, this place is wide open. A fortune to be made. You are gonna want to be a part of it. Yeah, well,I'm not so sure, not after the last one. We really soldthose people a bad deal. If I had to do it all over again, if I could change things, believe me, I would. But Capable Trust was a big score. And you're gonna get your cut. I don't know.I've got enough bad karmato last me six lifetimes. I don't need anymore. Hey, look at you. You're fried, man. You're all burnt out. It's okay, 'cause it happens to everybody. You needed to get away, and here you are. Okay... Marvin, my mind's made up. Hey, listen. Why don't you give this thing to Kaspar? Kaspar? No. It's, uh... It's just notthe same as you and me. Hey. I'm gonna getyour money, but you gotto wait two or three days. That's all right. I got to figure out this passport thing. I'll look into that. Things got funny waysof turning up around here. In the meantime, I want to see ifI could change your mind, make you reconsider.Stick around. Having a little get-togethertonight with a few investorsfrom Hong Kong, uh... A pig on a spit. A few girls come by. Nice. Must be the General. The ex-General. Once a general, always a general. He has contactswith police intelligence.He'll do anything for a buck, and I like him. General. I brought some of my staff. I hope it's okay. Oh, it's wonderful. Somnang, would you getsome drinks forour guests, please? You should be cautious. Sideth? General, this is my colleague and financial advisor from Hong Kong, Ming Chew. How do you do? He's going to be accompanying me to the coast for our presentation. Good. I have spokenwith our associatesin Kep, and everything'sbeen arranged. Casino? Isn't thata little premature? These peopledon't even have shoes. Joseph, why don't you stay out of this? We won't need shoes in my casino. You don't need shoes to lose. You know, I have a... I have a wonderful feeling about the old casino and its surroundings. And from what I gather, it could be the next Acapulco. Kep, Acapulco... Um, what would it cost to change that name? Why don't you call itMarvinville, Marvin? Right. Uh... Well, if you'll just walk this way I have something veryexciting to show you. We begin with our flagship, the 30-story, 500-rooms, Silver Palace Hoteland Casino. Connecting the hotelwith the casino will bean air-conditioned tunnel complete withmoving walkways. Our hunting lodgeand firing range will providea variety of weapons such as M-16, AK-47 and the B-40 rocket. Our big game park, will be featuring many exotic species from around the world. In addition will be 24 traditional bungalows, featuring air-conditioning and jacuzzis. Go on! Good boy. There have been someadditional complaintsabout the monkey. It's been pissingand shitting inthe bougainvillea. If I catch him, I promise you... I will feed himto Oliver, my python. He loves monkey. Oliver, Oliver, the monkey. Monkey. As I discussed with Mr. Chew, I have prepared some cash flow projections showing the cost of material, the cost of labor. Good morning, General. You sleep well? Yeah. Sorry I'm late. Can I speak with you a moment? Yeah, sure. Excuse me, gentlemen. You might want to have a look at this. Nevesky. They, um, arrived in Bangkok yesterday afternoon. Russians. How did they find me? What? Hmm? Well, you knowI wouldn't talk. No, no, no. Of course not. And Jimmy... Jimmy would never give me away. No, no, no. No, no. At leastnot deliberately. Um, where is the kid? He's at the Belleville. I'll go talk to him. Hi, sir. Who is it? It's me. I need to talk to you. Marvin's concernedhis whereaboutsmay have been revealed. He has to get out of townfor a couple of days. And he wants you to begone when he returns. Here's a plane ticketback to Bangkok. Five thousand dollars. Well, you'll get the restwhen everything settles down. You shouldleave immediately. Not without my passport. Thanks for the dough. Jimmy... Did Marvin mention anythingabout the money last night? No. It seems wrong. We've been with himso long, he's beenlike a father to you. Now to be treatedthis way... What way? We made nearly10 million dollarson that insurance job. Which he's nowrolled over intothis casino. He's up to his eyeballs with this ex-Generaland his guys, and you and l, we don't get to see a dime. Look, Kaspar, I'm not really concerned whether I get paid or not. To tell you the truth... I could care less about his partners, his casino. It's all yours. Just remember neverto let your personalfeelings for somebody interfere with your business. Marvin doesn't. No, he doesn't. This is one of the oldest wats in Phnom Penh. It sustained very little damage under the KR. And obviously, the murals on the inside which I showed you, that's most of the work that I do. Mmm-hmm. Let's hope they don'tinstall an escalator, like they did in Burma. So... What's next on your plate? Oh, um, Udong. There's this huge reclining Buddha that was blown tosmithereens during the war. Sounds like a big project. Yeah. We're gonnabe away for ages. When do you leave? The day after tomorrow. How come? Do you want to come visit us? Do I have to work? Good fortuneon your journey. This is an especially lovely gesture, General. Seemed appropriateon this auspicious day. I spoke tothe Vice Governor of Kep. He'll meet youat the disco at 9:00. There'll be a blue moon tonight. The second full moonof the month, always lucky. Ah, that's wonderful. If you have any trouble, do not hesitate to call. Everything's beentaken care of. Hey. How's everything, my friend? Good.Oh, again, I apologizefor the air conditioner. You know, I'm sorry. My guy was supposedto work on it, but he was drunk. Come, have a... Have a rink with me. Calvados. The best. Okay. Any luck with my passport? No news, but smells good. Hey! Marvin came to see you earlier. This should make things straight with us. Something's come up, and I've left town. This time, do not try to find me under any circumstances. It isn't safe. Make a new start for yourself. I'll be in touch. Good luck. Whoa! Robbie! You fucking idiot! Oh, Robbie. The Vice Governor called.He's sorry that you must wait. There's some problem on the roads. He wants you to feel welcome. The beautiful ladies will keep you companies. MARVIN: I could use a good massage. I'm not talkingabout the happy pull. My back is reallykilling me. When doesthe karaoke start? After. Do you like whiskey? Yeah, I love... I love whiskey. How do you think you're gonna get customers to your casino if the roads aren't safe? I'm really getting fed upwith your negative attitude. Marvin, we've been here for 3 hours. This is outrageous.Let's get going. Relax, Kaspar.You're on Cambodian time. If you don't mind,I'd like to go backto the hotel with my little friend here. Soak in the tub, and go to bed. Yeah. That's a good idea. Sure. Go. Go ahead. Take the car and make sure you send the driver back. Okay. Hey! Where you going? Come back! Hello? SOPHIE: So, you still haven't told mewhat it is you're doing here. Business.SOPHIE: Business? Well, do you wantto be more specific? I don't think you'd be interested.Try me. Hey, when was this built? Oh, it's Pre-Angkor. Before there was Buddhism, there was Brahmanismand Vishnuism. You're not evenlistening to me. Brahmanism and Vishnuism. Is she boring you? No.Robbie's really sick. He's so wasted. He's wet. He's gonna get pneumonia or something. Here. Give him this.Oh. Make sure he doesn't throw up on it. I can't promise you that 'cause he's off in space. Robbie, put this on. Snap out of it! You're not my fucking mom. Fuck you, dickhead! Marvin? Shit! Hey, Robbie! Where are you going? Mr. Jimmy. Hey! Hi, I waslooking for you. Yeah. What've you... I just, uh... I realized I have to go back to town because I have to do something in the morning. No, no, it's my passport. Remember, I told you, it was stolen? Yeah. All right.Yeah. Well, how're you gonna get back? Uh... Well, take the moto. Are you sure? All right.Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Hey, Jimmy. Are you okay? Oh, yeah! I'm fine! I'm just fine. But... No, no. It's great. Have you seen Robbie? Um, no. It's my fault. No, it wasn't your fault. No way.It is. You can't blame yourself. Everyone knowswhat he was like. How're we gonnaget him down? We roll him. Jimmy. You don't know what relief it's... What's this? You don't know this guy? I do not. Why don't you have a closer look? I've never seenhim in my life. Hey! Stay out of this! You're a fucking liar! I should cut you right now. You're making a mistake, Jimmy. Oh? Marvin's in trouble! If there's going to beany blood spilled in my bar, I'll do it! Don't test me! Put it away, Jimmy. Okay. What do you mean, "Marvin's in trouble?" Let me up and I'll tell you. You nuts? Shit! Marvin's disappeared. What do you mean "disappeared"? His bodyguardand business associatewere murdered in Kep. You knowwhere the casino is? Gulf town.400 klicks from here. What about Marvin? He's been abducted. What do you mean "he's been abducted?" What makes you so sure? Huh? Because I was there. I was lucky to get out alive. Yeah, right. You know what I think? I think the whole thing stinks! Look, come on! You sent that guy for me last night. Tried to have me killed. And now you're feeding me some bullshit story about how Marvin's disappeared. He's been abducted! What are youtalking about? You know Marvinand I would donothing to harm you. I mean, you're like a son to him. He asked meto look after you! What's the matter with you? How could you even think such a thing of me? Jesus, look at you. You're exhausted. You don't make any sense. Calm down, man! What's in it? Can you read this? No. It's in Khmer. What about Sok? Tell your friend they want money. English, for Christ's sake! The ground in Cambodia has many surprises. You must be careful as you go. Your friend, Marvin, has been foolish. As you see, he's paid a price. You must do what we saywithout wasting time. We demand five millionUS dollars. You have 24 hours to get the money. What the fuckdid you say? Five million dollars? That's insane! Yeah. You fucking black ass savage! Hey! Hey! Calm down! Oh, forget it! Take it easy. Who would be behind this? The Russians? Maybe someone more local. Who? Sideth? Well, he set upthe meeting in Kep, didn't he? He and Marvinhad business togetherand I don't trust him. It doesn't make any sense! Sideth and Marvin were partners! He's got nothing to gain from this! He knows everyone. You should talk to him. He can help you. And now get this fucking thing out of my bar! This is a considerable sum of money. I am as concerned as you are. Any ideawho would do this? Oh, you knowoutside the capital there is greater riskof kidnappings and murder. Marvin understood this. It could be bandits, ex-Khmer Rouge. It's not uncommon. Just the day beforea train was hijackeden route to the coast. Two westerners were taken. Backpackers with no money. Five million dollars. It's... It's an absurd request. SIDETH: This is typicalof these things. Of course, they ask for more than they expect. How much can you get? I don't have access to that kind of money. Well, 10... 15,000 dollars, maybe. That's not enough. They know he's rich. These men are likewild dogs. I can get some more. Oh, he paid you, didn't he? Go ahead and set up that meeting. Get the money andas soon as I havemore information, I'll contact you. Nevesky? You look so surprised. You know we were coming. I didn't expect you until next week. But I wanted to talk to you. About what? What is this? It's a present for my fiancee in Bangkok. So, where is myold partner, Marvin? I need to see him. Well, he's not in town, but he'll be back in a couple of days. He's fine. He's doing well. But there's a problem. What's wrong? It's a problem with the deal. I want all the money up front. Up front? Up front! It's a problem. No, you just give me all the money and I'll deliver Marvin. Otherwise, no deal. Uh... Very, very good. Very good. Jimmy, what is it? What's wrong? Do you remember the guy I told you I came here to see? Yeah.Yeah. Well, we were involved together in some business back in New York. What kindof business? Doesn't matter. It's... I'll tell you about it sometime. But, uh... He's in a jam right now and I can't leave him. I can't go back to my room tonight. You can stay with me. Thanks. That guy you weretalking about, his name's Marvin, right? Yeah. I know who he is. He lives up in the oldgovernor's residenceby the river. He tried to pay offthe RestorationCommittee once. He wanted to tear it downand build some mini-martor something. He made out that he's thisgreat philanthropistoffering huge donations. Dr. Collinstold him to stuff it? Yeah. That's Marvin. How come you gotinvolved with him? I mean, why do you care about him? It's different between us. What do you mean? It just is. It just is? You really don'ttrust anybody, do you? No. Well, that's a shame. Maybe it is. But there's nothing I can do about it now, you know? That's rubbish! You can't go throughyour life like that! Well, that's a tough one for me. Look. Marvin came into the picturewhen I was nine years old. The truth is, he and my mother were together before I was born. They kept that from me. He's your father? Yeah. It was never talked about. Why? It doesn't really matter, but Marvin's the only person who ever gave a rat's ass about me when I was a kid. He also taught me to lie, steal, cheat, get over on people. How am I supposed to trust anybody when I don't even trust myself? It takes time. Come on. Come on, you guys. Come on! Don't do this. Don't. Please don't. Please don't. Please don't. Don't! Please! Please! Please! Hey, please. Wait, don't, please! I don't want to... Please, I don't want to die! Please don't do it! Please don't do it! Don't! Don't! No! No! Don't, don't, don't! No! No, no. Please, please! No. I... I was just... All right! Just bring the... Bring the money! Kaspar, just bring the money. They're gonna kill me. Do you recognizethe other two? Yeah. Yeah. I met them at the Belleville... ...the other day. The reason Marvin is alive is because he is a businessman. He has money. The other twoare useless to them. Were you able to get any of the ransom? Yes. SIDETH: How much? I got enough. SIDETH: We can only hopeit will be enough. Enough. They have instructedthat he is to bring the moneyto a neutral location. Where? Koh Slay, on the coast near Kep. Where's the money now? With me. Bring it here.We mustn't waste time. No, not on your fucking life! The money doesn't leave my side. It stays with me. Do not underestimate these people. They do not negotiate. Yeah, well, neither do I! They get the... ...money up front. Half of it. And then after they deliver Marvin, they get the rest. You understand? That's the deal! SIDETH: As you wish. But we must move quickly. I don't trust any of these snake-eaters. Sideth sets up a meeting and Marvin disappears. Do the math yourself. Just meet meat the Belleville in the morning,9:00 a.m.,with the car. Make sure it's gota full tank of gas. Jimmy, you heard their demands. They want me to deliver the money! Forget it, Kaspar! All right. I'm just trying to dowhat's good for Marvin. Okay? Sophie? Hey! Wait! Wait! It's mine. Hey, Polin, it's fine. It's okay. It's okay. I was hoping maybe you'd changed your mind. Hey, Jimmy? Will you give this to Emile? Oh, sure. Oh, uh... You should take this. It's for a safe trip. My cousin. Let's see. It's K-59. Chinese made. Fire? Okay, okay, I buy, I buy. How much? Fifty dollars. Okay, here'sa hundred. Bullets.All right. No. You look like a shit! Do you remember, uh, when I first arrived here? There was a guyI was talking toat the bar. He was with Gerard.What's their story? No! They're nobody, you know! A fucking couple of deadbeats! They owe me money! If they coming back, I may kill them both! Somebody may have alreadysaved you the trouble. Oh... This is for you. It's from Sophie. Sophie? I never have any luckwith these things. Neither do I. Always die. So that's your family, huh, Sok? Yes, that my family. Say good-bye me here. That's nice.How old's the boy? Oh, my son is 16 years old. He wants to be a cyclo driver. Sixteen, huh? A chip offthe old block, huh? Yeah. Now he's... He can peddle a little bit of cyclo, but not so good. For me, I want him to go school. What's he doing here? He's coming with us.What? I trust him, which is more than I can say for you. Now, open this trunk. Good morning, gentlemen. You guys have breakfast? Mmm. Good. You follow me. I can only take you so far because if they see me or my men, the deal could collapse. It could be bad for Marvin. So, once we get to the outskirts of Koh Slay, you have to continue on your own. Shall we? Follow me. I'm really worriedabout Marvin. You don't trust me. It's Sideth you should be worried about. You take his instructionswithout a moment's reflection. You got any, uh, better ideas? Huh? I didn't think so. Just do me a favor and keep your fucking mouth shut. Where's the restof the money? I got it. You should leave it here.It's safer. Thanks for your concern, but it's taken care of. What's next? You keep goingdown this road until you come to a small bridge. Two kilometers after the bridge, you'll find a Bo tree. Bo tree is the tree with a big trunk with leaves shaped like a heart. Leave the money up in the tree and we'll be here waiting for you when you return. Who's that? What did he say? He said this is a holy place. He asked me if you come to see the sacred tree. Yeah. Tell himthat's what we're here to do. And, uh, ask himif any other menhappened to come by to visit the tree as well. He say other menwere here earlierto visit tree. What time? Two hours before? Two hours. He say for us to leavebefore nightfall. Okay.Road not safe. Road's not safe? Okay. Tell him thanks for the advice. He want a cigarette. What does he want? Cigarettes. We're running out of time, here. Where're you going? I'm pissing. Is there a law against it? It depends on where it lands. It is a holy tree. I'm baptizing it, black ass. Shit! What're you looking at? Where'd they go? It's bad. I knew it. Let's just keep on driving. We're sitting ducks here, man. What do you think, Sok? Think they went back to their village? Koh Slay villageis just up the road.I go and see. I walk. Jimmy, I don't like this.Let's go back to Phnom Penh. What about Sok? Oh, forget that gook.He's one of them. Let's go while we can. Marvin's probablydead already. That leaves the two of us. Maybe we could even go back to the tree and pick up the money! You know, Kaspar, you sicken me! Now, we're waiting for Sokand if you don't likethen take a fucking hike! You stupid motherfucker! You see what happens? You see what you made me do? You... The casino. There's a fortune to be made. You wanna be a part of it. You needed to get away and here you are. To tell you the truth, I think in some ways you're better off here. What happened? Here. Some water. Oh! Oh! Kaspar, he gotthe drop on me.We can't stay here. We should go back to Phnom Penh. No, we can't. Oh, man! Have you eaten anything? No.Oh, shit. Here. Here, take this. Take thisand go back to town No. Look, I don'twant you to get caughtin the middle of this. These people very bad. No good, no problem. I stay with you. Okay.I appreciate it, Sok. You're a good man. But you've got a familyand they love you. I guess this guyis the closest thingI have to anything like that. You understand? Yes. He's like your father. Right. So, please, just take this money. Head backto town. Please! No, no. We meeting back here. Okay. I still haven'tforgotten what I owe you. I know. You pay what you like. I'll meet you back here. Please! Please! Come you, guys! Come on! Today, you dead. You wantedto see Marvin? Well, here he is. Any timea foreigner's killed, it makes big problems for us. But sometimesit is unavoidable. As in this case. Stop! You really fucked yourself this time, kid. Why the hell don't you ever listen? I told you to leave, didn't I? What the fuck did you do? I had to do it. Kaspar, the little weasel, he turned. He's with the Russians. Then why'd you let him go? That's just what I wanted to do. He'll go back to the Russians empty-handed. He'll have to tell them I'm dead and that'll be that. All this for what? A fucking casino? Forget the casino. That's history. That was stupid to think they wouldn't track me down. I gave it to him. I got a boat. I want you to come with me. Marvin, it's over!I'm fed up! I need you to get on this boat with me and we gotta move quick, okay? Look at whatyou've done, huh? You went too far.You really lost it.

Here, you'll need this.Go ahead, it's yours. Those kids were way overextended. They were sniffingaround in placesthey shouldn't have been. It was justa question of timefor them. Look, I told you before, you reach a pointwhere you can't change. You're the wayyou're gonna be forthe rest of your goddamn life and that goes for you, too. Take the suitcase and put it in the back of the car. What's this? This? This is his! That's what this is. You saidhe was going with you. I know what I said.He has a change of plans! You can't let him walk away! It's too risky! Oh, yes I can and that's exactly what I'm gonna do. Stay out of this.Don't be foolish! He's a contentious fellow.He could make a lotof trouble for me! He's leaving and that's that. We do things my way, or nobody gets nothing. That wasn't part of the plan! Well, fuck the plan! Take the car.It's got a full tank. Take this piece. Now, go on, Jimmy.
