The 10th District Court MOMENTS OF TRIALS This film doesn't show entire courtroom proceedings. Their different stages were reduced to moments of trials. That's why permission was granted for this film. The moments were selected by the filmmaker. We thank the 169 people who let us film them. 25 were selected, by law, names and addresses were changed. Session of May 15, 11:30 AM Your name is Pierre Darche and you were born April 15, 1958 in Pornichet. What you're charged with today is as follows: that in Paris on Feb. 5, 2003 you drove a vehicle while intoxicated. 0.41 milligrams of alcohol were recorded in your breath. You were just above the indictable level. And well above the level for driving. The indictable level is 0.40 and you had 0.41 which means that you had 0.82 grams of alcohol per liter of blood. Can you tell us why you drove in that state? Sure. I left work around 8:30 PM I was with a customer who lives near me, in north Paris. I work in central Paris and drove him home. We had a drink, I can't deny it, and I haven't. I took the beltway round Paris to go home. I live two exits further along from him. It was a short drive, I went home. I admit these facts completely. But for me this is a bit hard, because... You say that it was a short drive, but even 100 meters... I realize that but... But one drink isn't enough to lead to a level of 0.41 milligrams. What did you really drink? I said it: it's called a Mojito. It's a Cuban rum drink, it was copious. -40 degrees! - And on an empty stomach... I worked late, drove home. It was a mistake. I didn't realize. I saw it was a big glass, I only had one. I was offered a second, I refused... The first must have been huge. It was very good, at the time. On the facts, this seems simple. How long have you had a license? Since 1977. How long has it been suspended because of this? I think it's for 6 months. - What do you earn per month? -15,000 Francs. That's round 1,800 Euros... I'm not sure. You've never had problems with the Law? None at all. Any questions, Prosecutor? None, your Honor. Defense? Anything to add? No, I ask for leniency. I admit my mistake. For me this is a serious setback. So I ask for leniency, and to get my license back. Yes, I had figured that out. Sit down. Prosecutor, your demands. Regarding the offense, he said at one point, "it wasn't very serious "as I wasn't very far from my home", but wherever you used the vehicle, you heard the levels recorded by the police, you endangered the life of others, when you drive intoxicated, your reflexes are greatly diminished. That's why the prosecution requires, based on the lesser level, that he be sentenced to a fine of 500 Euros and a 4-month suspension of his license. Thank you, Prosecutor. Sir, stand up. - Do you have anything to add? - No, nothing. Go into the next room, You'll get the ruling after the session. Next case. Case number 2, Michel Pavol and the victim, Josette Daranne Your name is Michel Pavol, and you were born Nov. 10, 1954 in Paris. You're appearing here charged as follows: that in Paris on February 3, 2003, you used offensive language... - Let's say, I... - You'll speak later. So Mrs. Daranne and Mrs. Perry who were on a mission of public service, during the performance of their duties, were called "bitches" by you. Those are the charges. The Court will hear you. It happened on Rue de Rivoli, a very difficult place to work, in my profession, I'm in construction. I was foreman of a worksite in front of City Hall where there's... heavy traffic and no place to park. So I was between the bus lane and the traffic lane, double parked, and I went back and forth unloading bags of rubble. As I was on my last trip, I came down, and the ladies were giving me... Here you say "the ladies". Right. Not quite the same! The ladies were giving me a ticket. I tried to negotiate, but they wouldn't hear of it, and the word escaped from my mouth. It's all quite clear. Sit down. Madame. Give us your version of what happened. It's as he said, it's the truth. He was parked in a spot where... if you park on Rue de Rivoli... One parked car can cause a traffic jam. It couldn't stay there. Had it caused a traffic jam? Or might it have? It might have. A car on Rivoli causes a jam fast. So we asked him for the car papers before he left and that's when he called us "bitches". We recorded this insult, and called our superior. Who called the 4th Precinct station, where he was taken to. It's true, he apologized but... We're conscientious and when people offend us, we can't tolerate that. It was the first time I'd been insulted that way. I've been a traffic warden for 18 months. You asked him to apologize and he refused? No, at first he didn't refuse. He said: "Have a heart, "I've got heavy things to carry." And after that I heard him say "bitches". I asked him to repeat what he'd said. He wouldn't and denied it. That's when we called our superior, and he offered to apologize. I accepted the apology, but we maintained... - The violation. - The violation, right. - You're also civil plaintiffs. - Right. You're asking for damages. How much? 200 Euros. Both go next door, and wait for the ruling. Won't be long. Next case. Any others? The Court is adjourned. Verdicts. 1:42 PM This Court after hearing both parties, finds you guilty as charged, and sentences you to a fine of 300 Euros. Your driver's license is suspended for 4 months, but allows you to drive for work purposes, from Monday to Friday, from 8 AM to 8 PM. The clerk will give you a document that explains how to plan for this. You understood? You may leave. You're found guilty as charged, both parties having been heard. Civil plaintiff, stand there. You're hereby sentenced to a suspended fine of 500 Euros. That's very lenient. It's only because it's a first time, because you apologized, and because of your attitude. But this sentence will be in your police record. And if you offend again you'll pay the 500 Euros, plus the sentence for the new offense. It exists, so be aware of it. Mrs. Daranne's civil suit, is deemed receivable, and you're sentenced to pay her 200 Euros damages. Settle it with the victim. You may leave. Thank you, Madame. Goodbye. Session of May 20, 3:32 PM You are Mrs. Nicole Deverdy. You're charged with driving, in Paris, on Feb 1, 2003, while intoxicated to wit having 0.59 milligrams of alcohol in your breath. You must have since thought about what happened. Can you tell us why, coming out of that dinner around 9:30 PM, you didn't use public transportation, or taxi? I went to dine with friends. I didn't only drink wine, I dined, then left right after so I could be in bed early. To get the rest I need for my work. I felt in perfect shape, not at all wine-sodden or anything. Yes, but... When you go to dinner with friends, at my age, I've never been stopped in 45 years of driving, it's the first time I've had a problem with an officer. I admit I may have had a glass of wine too many... I must interrupt you. You don't seem to understand this. You didn't have a problem with an officer, you committed an offense. It's not the same. You're not here over a problem with an officer, but because you broke the law. If the law states that over 0.40 mg in your breath and you're a bit over it, you had 0.50 mg, you're breaking a law. It's when one has drunk a little, though not as much as in a previous case, you feel euphoric, overestimate yourself, drive a bit further left than in a normal state, but your reflexes are a bit slower. So the fact that you feel able to drive has nothing to do with your actual capacity to drive. - Do you now understand that? - Absolutely. - I say that I was wrong. - Really? I said that from the start. I said I shouldn't have driven home. I said it from the start. I admitted it entirely. I went the next morning to Asniéres, to drop off my statement with the police, I was the first there, I waited 45 minutes, I'm somebody serious, I'm not an alcoholic. I drink water all day, 2 liters in 24 hours, and I rarely drink wine, only now and again, and only good wine. This was a very unlucky break. Yes, but you said to the Court, "if I'd felt unwell, I'd have taken a taxi..." And we heard you said earlier: "...as I felt fine I didn't take one." - Wasn't that a whole sentence? - Sorry, I misled you. Indeed! But I'm not like that. I tell you, I never drive when I've had a bit of wine -and I... - Except on that day! That day... You know, to err is human. I admit I made a mistake, and it'll be a lesson... I've had a license for 45 years without a problem. We know! Now we'll get to your character and see if the Prosecutor or your lawyer have any questions on either matter. So you own your apartment, are married, with 3 children, have 4 grandchildren, and you're an artist. You're self-employed? - Yes. - Completely? Yes, completely, I started to work at 17, after art-school, I was employed by... - The Art Institute. - Yes. You're a graduate of the Art Institute. That's my profession, my passion and... Is it your only source of income? Absolutely! On her character, Prosecutor, any questions? What is the accused income? Your average earnings? They vary... That's why I said "average". Sometimes I earn nothing for 6 months. You filed a tax return last year? What was your income? I don't remember. I usually do it with my husband, it depends if I make... So you can't tell us if in one year your art earns you, I'm speaking in Francs, sorry, 2 or 3 or 5,000 Francs, on top of your husband's income? On top of his income, it's hard to say... In a year... I make small things and bigger things... - You have to try... - An average... It's gone way down recently: say 3,000 Francs per year. - Per year? - Yes. On average. OK. What's your husband's income and your home maintenance? He's retired... - So he has a pension. - And he doesn't have... It's a small pension... Wait! if my questions seem indiscreet to you... - I don't know the figures... - Let me talk, please! It's because legally any fine has to be proportional to your income. So this is not the taxman asking you, I'm just trying to get a rough estimate, so you'd be better off telling us roughly what your husband's pension is, you must know that. I don't really know... He must get, I don't know... around 12,000 Francs a month... Any children to care for? No, they're all married. I have 4 grandchildren. No kids to pay for! No! Thanks for these hard-gotten facts. Prosecutor, you have the floor. I'm amazed: your job involves artistic expression... But you don't express yourself very well. And though they say the goal of art is to make reality visible, I don't think I quite got your message. Because your message, based on three sentences, is upside down. You say: "I had a problem with an officer, "I was unlucky that they stopped me, "and the officers were a bit unfair." That's putting the blame on others. It wasn't you, it was fate, destiny. "I was in the wrong place at the wrong time, "stopped by a patrol. "I didn't err, the officers did: "they were a bit overzealous." That's not the way to see things. To me, those words are outrageous. As a public servant I have to tell you: you were pulled over, I'm glad! Maybe from now on you'll avoid feeling too good at parties and thinking you don't have a drinking problem, or causing an accident. So it's a message of prevention that the lawmakers, via me, are sending you. I request a fine of 1,200 Euros, and a 4-month suspension of her license. Thank you, Prosecutor. The defense has the floor. Yes, your Honor. I don't share the Prosecutor's position in this case, as I believe that even though Mrs. Deverdy expressed herself poorly here, regarding her guilt and her admission of the charges, the first time I met her, she said to me immediately "I have to appear in Court, I'd had a few drinks too many "I shouldn't have drunk that much, "but I didn't realize I was too drunk to drive that day." She's had her license suspended pending sentencing and has lost points, and I think she'll cut down on her drinking and never drive after a dinner where the wine flows. Those are my comments, your Honor. Thank you. Madame, stand up! Have you anything to add? No, I think that just before I turned into the street where the patrol was, a few seconds earlier, I saw a car run a red light, but the officers didn't see it. I see that happen every day. So in my opinion, I don't deserve a 4-month suspension, at most one month, I truly believe it, I don't deserve any suspension of my license at all... We'll see about that. OK, but I'm just saying how I feel... So I gather... I'm a mature person, I'm not... I say it quite frankly... We're perfectly aware of your frankness. Go and sit down. You'll get the ruling after the session. Next case. Case number 12, Mr. Fabien Tabart. Hello, your Honor. My respects. Do you have a lawyer, sir? Yes, I'll go get the lawyer. Madame... Attorney Moreau. Now we'll... My respects. Meanwhile, I'll check your ID. Your lawyer's coming. Good. - Your name is Fabien Tabart? - Yes. You're born December 12, 1966 On 12/12/66 in Paris, in the 10th district! In Paris in the 10th. You live at 15 Ivry Road in the 13th? - Apartment 21/36... - You still do? -10th floor, in Chinatown. - OK. From now on I'll talk, you'll talk later. - You're charged... - Stay there, sir. Your police record is clean, you're charged with: in Paris on February 6, 2002, you took out of your home, one or several weapons of the 6th category, to wit a 12-bore single-shot shotgun and 9 cartridges. How were you arrested? You went into a McDonald's, then to the Café des Sports, you bought some cigarettes, went for a walk on Massena Boulevard, and say that in front of the Daumier highrise you found a shotgun and 6 cartridges in a trashcan. - I lied... - I said you'll talk later. You said: "I always check trashcans, I took the shotgun and cartridges, walked along a railroad track and shot at a beer can." What's your story today, since you say: "I lied"? Go ahead. I lied, but what I'll say isn't very important... No, we're interested in this shotgun. The shotgun wasn't beside me, there were no cartridges. It's not important, but I still want to say it. Start from the beginning. Before the police came, were you having fun with a shotgun? Before they came? Absolutely! Good. Tell us how you had fun with a shotgun. What happened, where you found it, etc. Where did I find it? I didn't find it. Then how did you get it? - I bought it. - Where? From someone who lives in my area. - You drank before coming here? - Just a coffee. - A coffee? - It's true. - Do you take pills? - It's true, Madame. I took a tranquilizer. So that's it! OK. It can have the same effect. Well? Back to square one. How much did the shotgun cost? From whom? I paid 250 Euros for it. That's a lot! Even the police officer said I got gypped. Sure. By whom? Who did you buy it from? From Christian. You can't say any more? I don't know his last name, I don't. And the cartridges? How did you get them? Christian got them for me. I didn't really want the ammo... I didn't want to... I didn't really want... to do anything wrong with them... You went for a walk and fired shots in an urban area. Yes, it's true. You're not charged with endangering life, only with carrying a forbidden weapon, sir. I'm sorry to be here... But you've taken tranquilizers, and it shows. And I hope you also haven't drunk beer today. Because that day, you'd mixed tranquilizers and beer. - You admitted it. - That's quite true! So even if you were checking out a tunnel, you couldn't be in control of yourself -if you'd taken that. - It's clear, I understand. Now, I understood perfectly. Why do you take tranquilizers? Did a doctor prescribe them? A doctor told me to, but now... I think I'll stop all that. It doesn't agree with me... I fell from the thirtieth floor. Before I was OK, I had a lot of work, then that happened to me. As far as work goes, I lost a good job. - I worked for an airline... - We'll get to that. I'm through with the facts. Any questions, Attorney? Prosecutor? What caliber was it, your Honor? 6th category, 12-bore, single shot. That's not for shooting rabbits! 12-bore is deadly! Yes, that's true. But they're old shotguns... They often misfire... Is it here? So you can see it. It's part of the evidence. We have a description. It may be confiscated. Regarding you, sir. You said you're a storekeeper. What does that mean? I worked in markets, but for 5 months, since I got arrested, I've stopped eating... - Just because of this? - I'm depressed. - I can't sleep. - Due to this? - Yes, because I'm... - Only because of this matter? To me it's very important. It's the first time, yet you said: "The police know me." What did you mean by that? They arrested me, and... They controlled me, things like that... "Controls, things like that"? To do with narcotics? Were you caught with... Once I was arrested with... -a dose. At the time... - A dose of what? Of heroin! 8 years ago! There we go! That didn't do you any good. Not at all, on the contrary! - What do you mean? - It did me no good at all! - You stopped... - It wiped me out. You stopped completely? I stopped completely. But I get by because... Your parents lodge and feed you. - They're nice to me. - OK. Sometimes. Sorry! Now and then. I had understood. Prosecutor, any questions on his character? None. - Attorney? - Thanks, no questions. Sir, go sit with your lawyer. Anything on his medical record? I wanted to talk. Then go ahead! I want to say a lot! Say what you think matters. May I come closer? No, this is public. The Prosecutor must be able to hear you. Then I'd rather not. This dual feeling of someone who's unwell, yet feels he can control his destiny, and do things to improve his lot, applies to Mr. Tabart. I think we should help him. I wanted to ask you to confiscate the evidence. Mr. Tabart can't be entrusted with a gun. I felt this is the main punishment he deserves. I would also ask for a psychological test of my client, to determine his level of responsibility. - Well... - Go on. A third thing I would ask for is a suspended sentence with probation, like the Prosecutor, because I believe he's in need of medical care. I leave it up to you to determine the most useful sentence for my client, but I insist on confiscation as the main one. The Court thanks you. Sir, stand up. Do you want to add anything? Do you want to add anything? - Well... - Go ahead! I agree with what the Prosecutor said, but I'm not sick, I'm not mad, I've decided to stop everything. I don't need treatment, I need... I'm a go-getter. I get out in a month, I'll find a job, I'll work and that's all. I don't want to... because I'll have to run around and I won't be able to. A suspended sentence with probation and compulsory medical care is not what you'd pick. I'm quite sure it's not needed. We'll think about all that. Go into the room, the ruling will be handed down later. Thank you very much. Sorry to have bothered you. Not at all... Next case. 5:01 PM You're Mr. Karim Toulbia? You're appearing here, you signed the summons, but the signature wasn't readable. Come over. See if it's your signature. Is that your signature? Or did someone else sign the letter? - Yes, it's my signature. - It is? Good. Then there's no problem. We've heard arguments from both sides... You're charged with the following facts: that in Paris, on June 11, 2002 and between July 1st and 5th, 2002 you repeatedly made hostile phone calls to disturb the peace of Miss Laura Lekouby. On June 13, 2002 she came to us and pressed charges against you for what she described at the time as harassment. Before these events you had a relationship. She said you couldn't bear the fact that she ended it. Then she received a lot of phone calls and that's what you're charged with. These are the messages recorded on her answering machine: "Listen, Laura, I'm not calling to get you back or anything, "screw you, I called your mother to get your things, "don't think I want you back, you're a pile of shit, "stop taking the red Moroccan taxi, "you know what I mean, around midnight or 1 AM. OK, bye." It's full of contradictions, you're checking up on her, you check what taxi she takes, and when, which is the opposite of what you claim "You don't interest me any more." So, what do you say about that? In fact, I called her mother, because she pesters my mother to get her things back. I didn't want to speak to her, but to her mother, so she'd pick up her things. That's all. But each time I get... I get the answering machine, I left some messages. - I read you those messages. - What? I read them to you. I didn't hear in these messages: "I'm calling so she picks up her things." Period. I heard something else in the messages. But it was so she'd get her things. You didn't only say that! On the third message, the annoyance is normal. I'd gotten... I'd gotten a call from the judge... Earlier you denied making the calls to her parents, today you admit you made those calls, and that you called her, and thought she'd answer, and you also said: "She's pressed charges against me, I'll get 5 months, I don't need that, "It's best to get out of town." What did you mean: "get out of town"? We spoke of me... it wasn't a threat? It was you who had to "get out of town"? - Well, yes! - OK. And it was your pal who told her boss, it's recorded: "Fire her, or I'll burn down your café." That's not true! It's impossible! - What? That you said that? - That I said that. - And that your pal said that? - It's impossible. Who said this: "Listen, bitch, I've been paid to waste "the slut and her guy"? I don't know about that. She said Hénia got that call. It wasn't you? No way. So you only admit to the last calls to the plaintiff's parents? About her things. I hope the civil plaintiff confirms this. Sit down. Madame... Tell us your version of what happened at the time, the facts for which you brought action. We're listening. I'd like to explain, that the facts you have there, are just a small part of what I went through for 7 years, 7 years of domestic violence, of being manipulated, of fear. He isolated me from my professional life, my family, he beat me, tortured me, even with a scalpel, he ripped up my things, tied me to the bed, he beat me with curtain rods, a baseball bat, anything he found. I was terrified for years, and afraid to leave him: I knew I'd be harassed. When I left him, an organization helped me, took care of me, protected me. But he kept on harassing me. He found me 3 months after I found a new job, I started to work in a restaurant. I don't know how, or who told him, but he found me, and harassed me. I held out, but I couldn't start my life over, after that, you can't start a new life, professional, sentimental, etc. At night he still tortures me, when I have a problem, I see someone who looks like him, I see him at night. He still beats me in my dreams, beats me every day. I'm afraid to go out, because I might run into him. Who knows what could still happen to me. Maybe 2 years later, it looks like he has a new life, but the next woman can't know what he's like, who he is, she doesn't know what he could do to her. He's extremely jealous, paranoid, very patient, a manipulator. Today he'll see what the Court decides, maybe he'll get a light sentence, who knows. But he'll be patient, and try again to ruin my life. So I won't give up. He's afraid of the law, that's why I'm here. I have my rights, I'm here as a victim, I need protection, so will his new companion. That's all. I'm not just here for myself. It's quite clear. All the calls mentioned in this case, were definitely from him? Definitely. Yes. You realized, hearing the civil plaintiff, the huge difference between your statements, and the descriptions by the civil plaintiff, which were, to her, a real nightmare, something much more oppressive for her, more violent or a lot more agonizing. The truth has to lie somewhere. Did you hear what I said, sir? You heard the civil plaintiff. What do you say to that? There's some truth to it, but... I'm saying I'm sorry to the Court, and to her, and I know that if I ever... I've made my life over... - It was hard for me. - When? She says you harassed her till January-February 2003. We're in June 2003. When did you meet your new companion? In September. Very well. And you live with her? So you say: “there is some truth to what she said, I'll never bother her again." I'm summarizing what you said. Do you have anything else to add? That I'm sorry I hurt her. But I suffered too, not in the same way... You suffered because she ditched you. But harassment is very disruptive! What? Everyone has the right to be free. That's true. - You can't force someone to... - I know. But 7 years together is quite... But she said it ended in 2001. - Anyway, now you have... - Now I'm sure of myself. I've turned a page... You gave an address. Is that your parents' place? - No, it's mine. - You live with them? No longer. I live with my girlfriend. Does she pay the rent, do you both? No it's, it's her apartment. - It's her apartment? - Right. Other questions? No. Any questions, Attorney, on your client's character? - I'm going to plead, your Honor. - Right. Sir, go sit down. Your Honor, in private affairs, the truth lies, as you said, somewhere in between. But, still, we have a duty. I, as the Prosecutor, to assure the protection, by enforcing the law, of individual freedom and public order, and especially that victims are protected, and their voices are heard. And you, as the Court, have to punish, but also to redress and to admonish. I stress this fact, because whatever the circumstances, even though we've seen cases like this many times, they're always painful, and need to be dealt with cautiously. They must be considered extremely important, because they lead to people's lives, and their freedom, being severely curtailed. It's terrifying that a young man can think that a woman is his possession and he won't return her, that she's his to compel and to threaten, whose life he can destroy, then say: "Now I've found another. "It's over, let's forget it, it's nothing." What matters in this case is the sentence you impose. That sentence will determine a future. Not his! He's already settled his future, he's already with someone else, but hers! That's why I request, your Honor, an 18-month suspended prison sentence, with probation for the maximum period. And be sure this sentence is fitting, just and firm! The Court thanks you, Prosecutor. Attorney, the defense has the floor. The hardest cases, your Honor, are these personal affairs. "Hello Laura, listen to me... "I'm not trying to get you back or anything like that. "Screw you." Maybe I've developed unconventional habits, I'm probably wrong, but when I start a statement with a denial, I question my motives. So when you make a phone call... He took a step today in Court, maybe not a giant step. He has a brother here. These aren't our proudest moments. At times I've been less than gentlemanly. Men tend to be sillier than women, in that area. I think that's when we're at our lowest, and I say "we" because I tend to be that way too, I think that's when we're at our silliest, I don't like to be gross, but we're real jerks, and I personally wish, that when, after 7 years of love, you're told: "Get out! I want no part of you! It's over! "You don't exist for me anymore!" Sometimes what was love, becomes what is most vile, which is hate. I wish love was not so close to hate, and when it becomes hate there are victims... And this lady is the victim in this hearing, as she already was in a previous hearing. I'm not trying to turn the tables. Seen from her side, it's inadmissible behavior. You don't care if hate is a form of love etc, you just feel that you're a victim of aggression. Your Honor, you've heard how for the last few months things have become more stable, he abides by the Law, it was the sanctions that made him decide to stop making those phone calls. I hope things stay that way, and that you'll hear me, and I ask for your ruling, though it may be a powerful admonishment, to be one that would befit a case, because, strange as it may seem, this case is about love, a frightening love, but not one for a criminal matter. Verdicts 6:53 PM The Court, after deliberating, finds you guilty as charged, and sentences you to a fine of 500 Euros. In a few months you'll receive a request from the Treasury to pay this fine. Your driver's license has been suspended for 2 months. The period already suspended will be deducted, so you'll receive a request to present your driver's license. - You may leave. - Thank you, your Honor. The Court, after deliberating, and hearing both parties, sentences you to be fined for 50 days for 8 Euros per day. So wait until you receive a summons to pay this fine. Do it immediately, or you'll go to jail for 25 days. Did you understand the ruling? Yes, very well... but for 50 days... I have to pay a fine of...? 8 Euros. How do I send it? You save it up, and in 50 days you'll be asked for 400 Euros. Your lawyer will explain to you how it's done. Did you understand? You may leave. You can collect any documents now, Attorney. - Thank you. - I think you have some. Case number 6, Karim Toulbia and Laura Lekouby. The Court, after deliberating and hearing both parties, finds you guilty as charged. It sentences you to a 16-month suspended prison sentence and puts you on probation for 2 years. So you now have a heavy sentence of 16 months hanging over your head. We can't ban you from Paris: it's where you live and work, but the victim lives in the 11th district of Paris, you are banned from entering this district. Injunction number 13. This injunction is as follows: it prohibits you from contacting in any manner certain people: we've only specified the victim. - Is that clear? - Yes. You may leave. The Court is adjourned. Session of May 30, 6:30 PM The Court! All stand, please. The Court is in session. You may sit down. Sir, are you better? Your name is Ali Bounik. You were imprisoned last December 30th. So you've been in detention for 5 months. You're charged with repeated theft in the subway, from several victims. Wallets? - I never stole. - But you're charged with that. You're also charged with attempted flight and resisting arrest. - I'm charged with that. - You won't be judged today... I won't deal today with the basic facts. But you wrote and asked for your case to be reviewed before the session that is due in 13 days, and you asked to be freed meanwhile. You were sick a moment ago... Is it a chronic illness? Yes, for 2 weeks I've been on a hunger strike. I'm asthmatic and allergic to mites, I can't take all the dust in jail. I've considered suicide, because I'm innocent. Look at my record, I've never been troublesome. I've made mistakes, I paid for them, I don't deny it. But here, your Honor, I'm innocent! My wife's coming from Belgium, I've been in jail for 5 months and the baby's all alone. It's abnormal! It's unjust! But there's an aspect to your case, which will be judged June 13, is you're in France illegally. No! I'm due for my 10-year residence permit, I've been here since 1980. But for the moment you don't have it. I have an appointment at City hall... Yes, you hope to get a residence permit. But I have a child, I can't be expelled. Fine. Let's deal with your criminal record. 1992, one month for theft and using a false identity. 1995 in Paris, 3 years and banned from France, for theft with violence, illegal entry into France. 1997, Paris Appellate Court, 3 years and a 10-year ban from France for receiving stolen goods, use of a fake ID and illegal entry into France. 1999, in Créteil, one year and banned from France for receiving stolen goods, fraud, use of fake ID, illegal entry, use of narcotics. What narcotics? - They caught me smoking. - Cannabis? 2000 in Paris, 2 years in jail, and banned from France for 10 years for assaulting an officer... He slipped and fell. An officer of the Paris Transport Authority? Yes, he fell, I didn't hit him. But the sentence is final, you didn't appeal. No, because the Prosecutor asked for 4 years and I got 2. One time I appealed, and they added a year. - Fine. - They're out to get me. Our problem is to find out what to do today. If you should be judged as a prisoner, or if you should be judged free at the session due in 13 days. Now you can go sit down. Session of June 13, 3:20 PM Sir, tell the Court your version of the facts. We were patrolling the Paris North Station, and saw this man located, as he usually is, near the one of subway turnstiles. We hid some twenty meters away, behind a swing door leading to some steps. We had a perfect view. Two tourists appeared: they had suitcases, backpacks, purse, and so on. It happened as follows: the man went through first, the woman was right behind. She pulled a bag on rollers, and wore a backpack. He pretended to help them through... actually blocking them in the turnstile. He said to her... I presume because she handed him her bag, "I'll hold your bag." He turned around, that's why when he stole from the backpack he was facing us, about 20 meters away. He turned around, opened the backpack, put his hand inside, and took something, he even closed the bag, as he turned back, and returned the bag to the victim. But as he turned, the man with the victim realized what Mr. Bounik was doing and started shouting. That's why Mr. Bounik ran away because the victim's husband went back through the turnstile after him. We caught up with him 15 minutes later, and recovered the credit cards, as he was throwing them away, I must admit that was very lucky. I grabbed him by the arm, stated I was a policeman. That's when he came at me hands first, I pushed him away, put my hand on his face, and gripped him in a stranglehold, and since he resisted, I decided to cuff him on the ground. That's when he protested and called me all kinds of names, I nonetheless managed to cuff him, but when I saw a crowd had gathered, and I didn't know how they felt about me, usually I'd pin him down till help came, but I put him facing a wall, thinking that if he escaped, I was better off standing than on the ground. I held him that way, and he slammed his head to the wall. That's a trick of his, as he knows very well if he ends up in Tusco, the prison hospital, the infirmary...of the City, he may avoid jail and... -avoid fast-track prosecution. - Right. So he mutilates himself, swallows bits of glass, bangs his head against walls, he's known for that. You've given us a very detailed answer. With regard to the facts, I know enough. Any questions? Go ahead! He says he saw me, the lady gave me her bag? He says I took the wallet, why didn't he arrest me at once? OK, I understood! He says they were 20 meters away. How far is that? The prisoner asks why when you saw him take the wallet, you didn't arrest him at once? It happened in less than 20 seconds. He's a professional thief. He's good at his job as I am at mine. - That means you know me well? - Yes, I do. We've gathered you know each other! From the moment I was sure there had been a theft and the moment Bounik ran away, 20 seconds elapsed. I'm athletic, but I can't fly. Any other questions, sir? Via me! Supposedly I ran away from the victim's husband. Would I stop in front of the train station? If I know that the victim... - You already said that. - No, I didn't. I know the victim's looking for me, she'll go to the police. Would I stop in front of the station? OK, I understand. That's not for the prisoner to answer, why you did or didn't run away, it's an argument you'll develop later... Any other questions, for the plaintiff or your client? No? When he arrested me 3 days earlier, he said "I'll get you!" Why? Because the last time I was arrested, I got out of Tusco. He arrested me, searched me. I swear it, your Honor... - I foresaw this... - We know each other well... Is it true that 3 days earlier, searching him, you said: "I'll get you." No, I told him to move on. Is it true you were unhappy he'd been released after being arrested for a similar act? I may sound casual, but that's not up to me to decide. My job is to arrest him and relate the facts to the Court. I see him committing a theft, I do my job. What the Court does later isn't my business. Quite. That's why I can't have a personal vendetta. The second reason, is that my job with pickpockets, if it's not him it'll be another. - In what way? - There's so many of them. I'm not here to fill a quota, or to target anyone in particular. It's impossible. We spot 10, 12, or 15 per day, we follow them, and sometimes they act at once, sometimes we wait an hour. I can't have any personal vendettas. Sir, you want to be a civil plaintiff, Sir, you want to be a civil plaintiff, how much do you request? I'm not well-informed on that. We can't suggest a figure. Maybe you know what some of your colleagues got in cases of insults and resisting. - You had no work stoppage? - No. I had one day of reduced work. One day of reduced work. Let's say 500 Euros. You ask for 500 Euros damages. Anything else? Later you can't speak. Sit down. He says that I always admit the facts, and I do! I've never been a problem on that score. But this time I can't admit, even if I get a heavier sentence, because I didn't commit these facts. That day I was waiting for my wife who was coming from Belgium. I asked her flat mate, who confirmed it. That's why I was there at that time. Toward 10 PM, or 9:30 PM. When the facts occurred. So in this case allow me to say that there's a lot of doubtful elements which is why I ask your Honor, the Court, because he's already in jail, he's done time, he's in a tricky situation, he's tried suicide twice, he's on a hunger strike! It's dangerous, we may regret things. I ask you to acquit him for lack of proof, to avoid regrets. I thank you. The Court, having deliberated and examined both sides, finds you guilty as charged. We considered that all the elements of proof were sufficient to pronounce a sentence. You're sentenced to 12 months imprisonment. And you shall remain incarcerated. - That's unjust, Madame. - The Court... That's unjust, it's the first time I see such injustice! - You have 10 days to appeal! - I know I have, I know it! I get a year for something I didn't do, but I can appeal! I hope you sleep well, that's all I can say! - Don't worry ! - People who steal, you let off! - And I who did nothing... - Don't worry about our sleep! I did nothing, your Honor, nothing, believe me! I hope I'm the first innocent you've sentenced! - The Court also... - You sentencing an innocent! And for one year! Why? I'm not through. The Court also bans you from France for 10 years. And orders you to pay the civil plaintiff... ...the sum of 500 Euros. 500 Euros, too! That's justice? Mr. James Nsan Wet! I hope you sleep well, that's all I can say! I needn't worry, there's a God somewhere... One year in jail, and a 10-year ban, why? Then Mr. Nsan Wet is not here, that's unfortunate. We'll wait... to pronounce... French justice! Is that French justice? Session of June 13 7:42 PM Fast track prosecutions You're in here under a sped up procedure called fast-track prosecution. You may ask for a postponement to prepare your defense. I presume you spoke to your lawyer. What's your decision? To be judged today or later? Today. This occurred in the Forum des Halles in Paris. Police officers say they saw you give a lump of cannabis, then a banknote was given to you by the other person. That's when they decided to arrest you both. You're not in a police station now... What can you tell us? What's your version here? My version is that Fabrice Petaite is my nephew, we meet every day, and we'd met that Friday. He said he'd brought me the 10 Euros he owed me. He gave me my 10 Euros. And he asked if I had anything he could smoke. What I had was for my personal consumption... I've dealt in the past, but no longer. I've had problems like that before... We'll go over your record later. So he repaid you, gave you 10 Euros, and said: "Got anything to smoke." And you gave him the cannabis. So it wasn't an exchange, these two events happened at the same time but weren't related. - They found 380 Euros on you? - Yes. - Where did it come from? - It's my money. I was going to make my car payment. I'm late for it. I had the form to send the money. I had my money because I got too late to Paris to earn 380 Euros, I don't think I'd have had time to earn the 380 Euros they found on me. Sit down. Prosecutor, what are your demands? Mr. Christophe Sanal, you live above your means. And you consume above your means. I made a fast calculation: you say you smoke 4 joints a day, at a rate of 20 Euros per day, that's 600 Euros a month to supply your needs as a drug-addict, and let's not get into how cannabis isn't addictive. That leaves you, after your car payments and bills, 300 Euros. And you don't spend these 300 Euros on rent since you are lodged at no cost. These 300 Euros are your pocket money, sir, and don't interrupt while I prosecute. You know that, as it's your 3rd time in court, and for a fast-track prosecution! So tell us, what you do with these 300 Euros pocket-money once you're satiated in cannabis, and have made your car-payment? You don't do much more than buy yourself clothes and hang out. Hang out in late or, actually, early evening, in place that isn't dedicated to Culture, but that like the Pompidou center, sadly, is totally dedicated to cannabis dealing! Very well. In your 2 previous fast-track sentencings, you were given an alternative to prison. Well, that's over! You didn't understand that alternative, but now maybe you will, if the Court follows my demands! Your acts, and the fanciful way you try to explain them, deserve a 15-month prison sentence, partly suspended, and with a period of probation. As a repeat offender, you risked 10 years, sir! Partly suspended and with probation: medical supervision, justification of employment, and of domicile, and a fine of 1,500 Euros. That's a bit more than what you earn, about 3 times what you spend in 3 months. The Court thanks you. Attorney, the defense has the floor. Thank you, your Honor. I'm pleading on behalf of Mr. Sanal. I'll try and show what this case really amounts to. There are two ways of viewing it: ls Mr. Sanal a drug-dealer, who lives off his dealing? Or is Mr. Sanal sick, a drug-addict who is hooked, but also has a big heart since, he gave up, something he shouldn't have done, a part of his personal supply, to his cousin, who is afflicted with the same illness, though less seriously, and who got off with an admonition. The Prosecutor stated that Mr. Sanal lived above his means. She also implied he lived above the law. It's partly true. But the Law can't invade every nook and cranny, can't impose a norm, it must leave space for freedom. We heard the Prosecutor demonstrate by what looked like a clever mathematical deduction, how little money Mr. Sanal has left to live on. 1,200." 600... 300... and then to state that 300 Euros is like having nothing. I say, so what? We're all free to live as we want! If Mr. Sanal only has one pleasure after a day's work, and maybe it is reprehensible, to smoke joints and hang out at Les Halles, the Law can't interfere with that. It's not possible! We're all free. The Court, after deliberating and hearing both parties, finds you guilty as charged. The sentence passed on you is 12 months incarceration, 6 months in jail, and 6 months suspended with probation. With the three requisites of Art. 132/45, that is, a fixed domicile, steady work and 2 years of medical care. The Court orders your immediate incarceration. We'll explain why, it's easy enough. Your 3 previous convictions weighed heavily, the Court considered that you didn't tell us the truth about the sale. So, even though you have a job, the repetition of these acts, it's your 4th appearance for the same thing -explains the ruling. You have 10 days to appeal. But meanwhile you'll remain in prison. If you appeal, we'll see, but if you don't, it's 6 months jail, 6 months suspended, with 2 years probation. You may sit down. Next case. You're here charged with, in Paris on June 11, 2003, surreptitiously removing a wallet from Mr. Silva, a theft accompanied by violence not conducive to any inability. You deny these charges. You said that an African-type man whose name you don't know, asked you for crack but you told him to move on. That he insisted, that you told him to go away. Then he pushed you, went to look for a pal, and then they both came toward you. "I asked a hooker friend to call the police, and they ran away." That's what you said. What do you have to say to the Court now? They were together, a victim and the witness, they were both in front of my building. I came from jail, there was a strike, and I walked a long way. I was tired, and got home around 11:30 PM. Then I saw those two men in front of my door. - Outside? - Inside the complex. The first building, where you punch a code by the staircase. As I go in, I ask them what they're doing there. They're smoking. They ask me for it again. I say: "I got out of jail, and you ask me that! "I'll punch you, and put out your eye." Then he went to get his pal, and they both came back. I called my friend, I said:" Call the police." I didn't have a cell phone, I was in jail, I had nothing, I hadn't even gone home, or seen my daughter or my wife. I'd like to understand, because your story is very confused, if you had a score to settle with them, or they with you? It sounds as if there was a previous disagreement. Maybe for them. Not for me. I'd come to see my family, I see him in front of the building, I tell him to get out. Which building you do mean? Because at the hearing of June 12, this morning, last night at 3 AM you said: "I was in front of the stadium door. "I don't know its name, it's on rue des Poissoniers." Rue des Poissoniers! - OK, but it's not your home. - It's mine. As I was in jail, my wife went to live with her mom. She can't stay there, my dad left for the U.S. That's not what I asked! The place where that happened... It was there. But it's not your home, you live in Lssy! Lssy is where I live with my dad, my wife and daughter... Then what's at rue Poissoniers? My wife's parents' place. Then why "the stadium"? It's beside it, where I do sports, same street, number 9. The stadium is there, and the building is below. The stadium is there, and the building is below. Why, when you got out of jail, didn't you go home to Lssy? Because there, I'd be alone, my dad's in the U.S. I had told my wife, because the social worker, Mrs. Mazepa who visits me, I asked her to call my wife, so she'd go to her parents when I'm out for a month. She went to her parents, she didn't know I was getting out. Now I'm out, I decided before I go to Lssy, I want to see my daughter and her mom, then we'll all go to Lssy. Is her mother a prostitute? No, that's another girl I knew before. We smoked crack. Now I'm out, they know me, I said call the police. You were in that area, for those reasons, with the prostitute you told to call the police. I told her to call the police. Was it because you didn't want to give your real address? The address in Lssy -isn't really valid! - No, it's valid! It is? You have the key, yes or no? My wife has the key, that's where she was. I had to walk because of subway strike. If the police hadn't come, where would you have slept? At my wife's, or her parents, we live there! - Meaning? - My wife. - Meaning? - My daughter's mother. - The address? -11 rue Poissonnier. Why didn't she know you were getting out of jail? - I couldn't tell her. - Why? Because I couldn't call Mrs. Mazepa, who visits me. But you know how to write? No, I don't know how to write, that's the problem. Or read, the only thing I know is installing mechanical things. - You never went to school? - No. I was at school a bit, when I was eleven. Then I quit, became a mechanic, electricity, things like that. Of course I'm asking for an acquittal. For obvious reasons: there's no victim here. No civil plaintiff. No spoils. I saw in the file: "Declared wrongs: none." "Damages: none." "Bodily harm: none." I must plead for acquittal. I won't be any longer. Thank you. The Court thanks you. Sir, stand up! You have anything to add? Nothing to add. Just that everything I did... my previous sentences, that's all past. But as for now, I won't do it again, I want to get in shape, to start to work for my daughter's future. Sit down, the ruling will be given later. - Anything pending? What? - Case 17, your Honor. Mr. Kamel Badir, stand up, sir. Your name is Kamel Badir, what's wrong with your arm? - I broke it. - When? 2 weeks ago. With regard to the charges, It's true, the police know you and watched you. In Boulogne Park, you were seen screaming, coming and going and crossing a passerby you took a knife out of your back pocket and threatened this man, saying: "I'm going to stab you." Had you already seen this man? You knew him? No, I didn't and... Did you do that? Madame, I didn't hurt him... I hurt no one. I insist on that word... Why would I take a knife, and insult a man? We don't know either! And put it back in my pocket. What would I gain? I have no reason to do that. You know the charges, you denied them, and we have all this data to try and find the juridical truth. Regarding your personal situation... You live, you're... No, that's not you. What do you do in life? I work in industrial cleaning. Every day? Sometimes I work in... - But with your arm? - I'm not working now. - Of course. - I'm not working. - You live all alone? - No, with my parents. Yes, are they here? Yes, my father and my kid sister. So your family is here. Sir, can you come over? My dad hardly understands French. You don't? Could his sister translate? - Your brother lives with you? - Yes, at 42 Rue Godzan. Has he had mental health problems? Yes, he's been treated at a local center for 2 years. Does he work regularly? It depends on his assignments. But not every day, for sure. Does he get a handicap indemnity? No, he doesn't. - He works from time to time. - Quiet! Any questions on his domestic situation? Thank you, miss. Mr. Badir wasn't the only person strolling in Boulogne Park. A man was chased by the police wearing a white jacket who threatened someone with a weapon, but in my client's present condition wearing a cast, how could he wield, I just saw him sign the waiver for the film. He can hardly hold a pen. How could he chase someone with a knife and try to stab him? The victim says his assailant was less than 3 feet away. There's a physical problem, before the psychiatric examination. Is the person here physically capable of committing what he's charged with? To me that's problematic. 2:07 AM Are you Mr. Kila Merhan, or Kila Demko, what's the right first name? Kila Demko. Kila Demko, born January 19, 1981 in Nouachcot in Mauritius. - In Mauritius or Mauritania? - Mauritania. Why does it say Mauritius? We don't know which is your police record. What was your father's first name? Kila Semba. He wasn't called Ahmad? What was your mother's name? Kila Habi. She wasn't called Aminata Diop? Are you sure of what you're saying? Yes, I'm sure. You're charged here with having, on June 12, 2003, entered and remained in France without having the required documents. You're also charged with, on June 12, 2003, of avoiding being expelled by a decree of the Paris police of February 16, 2003, of which you were notified the same day. Why are you still in France when you were ordered to leave? Tell us. I tried to take the right steps, but I don't know what my nationality is, I have no papers to get other papers. I've tried for 6 years. Where are your Mauritanian papers? My mother's Mauritanian, but I don't know what my father is. You said you're a French national. You don't say that now? What nationality do you think you are? I don't know what my nationality is. You never knew your nationality? Never. At what age did you come to France? - I was 16. - With your parents? No. With someone who gets you in. - A smuggler? - Right. Your parents stayed in Mauritania? I lost my father aged 8, I don't remember... When did you leave your family? My family? In late 1995. Yes. So a smuggler brought you here when you were 16? What happened to you then? I worked in the home, sometimes I got out on Saturday. In a hostel or a private home? A hostel. - Where is this hostel? - In Mantes. In Mantes. You never tried to get a residence permit? No, I don't have any papers to show, in case I could be a political refugee. You have no documents at all that could show your identity? Nothing? Nothing. That means it'll happen again. What will you do? You wish to stay in France under those conditions? What is your... No, I'd like to be legal. But I've no paper to show, to get an ID. In the hostel, you never met a welfare worker? Someone who... There are organizations that act for people like you. There's one in Vincennes, you could have seen them. - Maybe, I didn't inquire. - You don't remember. Verdicts 2:32 AM Regarding the theft, we found there were conflicting versions and as the victim gave a false address and phone number, and that you had denied these charges you are acquitted for lack of proof. - You can sit down. - Thank you. The Court, after deliberating and hearing both parties, has designated a psychiatrist for you, Dr. Meyer-Buissan. His report is due before September 1st, 2003. In the meantime, between today, June 13, and the hearing of September 16, I'm placing you on probation. Luckily for you, you have family that lodges you, and we trust you because you've had no brushes with the Law for 11 years. The Court, after deliberating and hearing both parties, finds you guilty as charged, sentences you to 6 months in jail with 6 months suspended. You're also banned from France for 3 years, which means, that you now have to be taken to see one of the many organizations that help foreigners without ID, and take the necessary steps to leave, because the law doesn't say France must expel you, but it's not an obligation and if you don't leave then you're considered to be responsible. You understand? Session of June 19, 4:26 PM Your name is Antoine Turpin, born June 16, 1966 in Moulin. You're here because you're charged with carrying outside your home a 6th category weapon, to wit, an Opinel locking-blade knife. It began as a problem with the Paris Subway Authority, and when they saw you were carrying that in the subway, you admitted the facts, but you couldn't explain why you were carrying it. Your refusal to be fingerprinted... You want to write something? To make notes. I know I can't talk now, so I won't forget things. Is it so complicated? There are 2 charges. I never saw a prisoner who needed notes to answer truthfully. Concentrate, and we'll try to be precise and short. The refusal of fingerprints is surprising: it's mostly done to hide a police record. You don't have one. You gave us an explanation, but as you're in a hurry and don't want to be questioned later... - I'm in no hurry. - you'll explain it now. Why were you carrying this knife? I've carried an Opinel knife since I was 3 years old... - Aged 3! You started early! - Of course. I was... - A Boy Scout? - Not at all, I was born in the southeast, close to Savoy, 30 miles from where Opinels are made. I've done a lot of mountaineering with my parents, and in my family we exchange Laguiols, another well-known brand of collector's knives. - I'm aware of that. - Yes. It's a family tradition for us to carry a knife, to slice a sandwich, or cut a stick, string, electric wire, and so on. - But you knew it was forbidden? - No. Never? You never heard of it? No, but I... Besides, if you'll allow it, an Opinel number 8 is not defined as a weapon. May I use my notes? You don't have a lawyer, so you... No, I don't. I'll defend myself, if you'll allow it. You're allowed a lot. Stop saying that! OK. The definition of a 6th-category weapon, Art. 2 of the Decree of May 6, 1995 states that it must have a blade... Carry on, but don't be too long. It must have a blade longer than 15 cms. Opinel No. 8 is 8.5 cms. A width over 4 mms. Mine is 2mm. The blade must extend from the handle. It doesn't. Both edges of the blade must be sharp. They aren't. Without any one of these features, it's a tool, and only becomes a weapon if used as one. - Right! - Like a screwdriver. A weapon threatening public safety. That's in the penal code. Only if used as one, it must be used... You're not going to teach me the penal code! That could be quite annoying! The Court knows the difference between a weapon and an object used as one. Trust us on that score, if you'll allow me! Your Honor, I told the policemen who arrested me, and who were there to check ID's, one of whom was quite violent with me, and who slammed me against a wall. To search me in a very violent way. Then... As you're a sociologist, you can surely put up with that with serenity. No, when I'm slammed against a wall... - Without reason? - By a hostile policeman. I'm scared! So you consider that your weapon isn't a weapon of the 6th category, which you're not allowed to carry. That's for the law to decide. No, you're defending yourself now. What do say about the charges? About the charges... I question the classification of this weapon, that isn't one, but is a tool, and I also came here, as I was anxious to let you know this and to apologize, because I feel I'm wasting the Court's time. All cases matter. Very well. That's my request, as I spent a whole morning in the St. Lazare police station, a morning where I could get nothing done, because of this business. I was prevented from using my phone to organize my work in my absence, but the police phone-operator phoned her girlfriend the whole time I was there, over two hours, and when I was heard... A small parenthesis: aren't you being a bit vengeful now? People are being abused this way too often, that's why I asked the police to send me here so I could tell you this, because I lost... Usually people can't decide on that! But I'm not finished yet, because I may ask for damages. Try! You can always try. Why did you refuse to be fingerprinted? That's the second charge against you. - Because, as I said all along... - Say it again. Not now. Throughout my arrest I told them: I did no wrong! I did no wrong! - So no fingerprints? - No fingerprints! It was an unlawful arrest: I didn't have to submit to that farce! Very well! Prosecutor, what are your demands? In a previous case, we showed someone who was an outlaw. Mr. Turpin feels that he's above the law! But he wants it applied to others with all speed, like the poster he resented in a police station, and all the wrongs he thinks were done to him. And now that he's in a law court, he dares tell us that it's at his request that the Court has spent nearly a half-hour on him. I suggest a fine of 800 Euros, and to discourage him from repeating the offense, of carrying illegal weapons and acting rebellious, he deserves a one month suspended prison sentence. The Court thanks you. Sir, stand up. You have anything to add? I'm not a lawyer, I'm a sociologist and not very familiar with legal procedures. But I noticed that my summons drawn up by the St. Lazare police, when I was arrested, is dated November 13, 2003, so my arrest has yet to take place. Isn't that a procedural error? Wouldn't that invalidate this debate? If you'd asked "in limine litis", You know a little, but not enough. That means, before any debate. But you didn't study Law! Go on, sir. I only just noticed it. You're quite something! - Of course... - Are you through? Almost. I think I already said it, if I'm sentenced, which would be scandalous, I'll appeal it... - Go ahead now, it'll save time! - Why? - Or give us time to decide? - Of course! - Well, thank you! So go on! - I'm through. Thank you. I'll rule at the end of the session. Next case. You're charged with having, in Paris on December 26, 2002, failed to comply with a summons to stop given by an officer assigned to control violations, displaying the badges and clothing of his function. You're also charged for having, at the same time and place, driven a vehicle without having a valid driver's license for this type of vehicle. So it's all quite clear, you admitted it. What do you say now? We're listening. I agree, but you also say I ran a red light. I didn't run a red light. I didn't stop because I was working. If you're working, you don't have to stop? If I hadn't been working, I'd have stopped. But I was delivering to customers, I couldn't stop. You still think your customers come first? I work, I have no choice. You still think you have no choice? If tomorrow, when you're delivering, a policeman tells you to stop, you'll keep going... - No, I didn't say that, but... - Really? But that day I did it. Yes, indeed. But you also said it was because of your license. - Wasn't that the main reason? - It was. - Do you have a license now? - No. When did you last drive a car? When was it? This morning, at work. - A car requiring a license? - Yes. Today you drove without license? Yes. - You realize what you're saying? - Yes. You think needing a license, penalties for not having one, losing points, -is for others, not for you? - I didn't say that. I tried hard to get a blank license. But no one would help me. What could I do? Not drive! So what do I do, hang out? You do other work. Many people... I've no diploma, my only diploma was my license. Many people work, without a diploma or a license, but they work. Do you realize that everything you've said makes me fear that leaving here, you'll drive a vehicle? In any case, tomorrow morning since you have to work. Yes, but I don't drive every day. Thank heavens! You could lie to us, but you're not lying, but you've also understood nothing! If someone's license is taken away, it means he hasn't the right to drive at all. - You haven't understood... - I agree with you. But why did they take away my license? For a red light! I'm a driver. If I don't deliver, I'm fired. So I stop work. if I know my next job, it's no problem. - What isn't? - What isn't? Like others. I'll sell drugs, steal cars! - I'd rather say it out front! - Wait, sir! - Let's calm down. - No blackmail! It's not blackmail! Why blackmail? You calm down! I tried to tell you, but you won't listen, that in this country one can't choose between being a driver, or unemployed, or between being a driver or a drug dealer. Many people work without having a driver's license or a diploma. - Apparently, you don't agree. - Yes, I do. Ever tried another apprenticeship? Yes. - What? - Security guard. For 3 months, I gave up. I went back to deliveries. It's true: many security guards have your profile which can be a bit worrying to people. There's the situation, it's completely deadlocked. Do you know about community service? Yes. - Have you done any? - No. Since you know what it is, can you tell us? - It's bum gigs. - What's that? - Working for free. - Yes. For whom? For you! For the State! You identify a judge with the State! - Makes sense, no? - For society. - Or for an organization... - Yeah, it's voluntary work. Yes, voluntary. But it's still a sentence. If it was general interest work, not driving, - would you agree to do it? - Yes. It doesn't mean we'll do that, but I must know if you agree. What can you say in your defense? - Nothing. - Nothing? It's true, when you talk you aggravate your case. No, I'm accepting it. Or are you provoking? - No, accepting it. - Very well. Then wait next door, the ruling will be handed down later. Next case.
