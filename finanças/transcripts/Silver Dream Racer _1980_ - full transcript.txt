Past the pit and it's still Freeman from McBride. Boy has McBride got a fight on his hands. Freeman is in first place and he just can't get past. Rounding into the straight and Freeman is opening up the gap. McBride is closing. The crowd is on its feet. He's done it, McBride's passed Freeman on the inside, and Freeman has trouble.

Oh listen, when a guy has trouble out there in front of you, you gotta get out of there quicker. - Now wait a minute I was on the inside. You should have pulled back. - I was leading. - No an inch in it. - I held back because of your position. - Piss off you pushed me right through-- - Oh I'm sorry was I a little rough on you?

What were you trying to do, impress that chick? It'll take more than you to impress that chick. - What do you want me to do, sign a statement saying I'll never do it again? You wait till next week. I'll show them, they won't know what's hit them. - [Cider] I'll read about it in the newspaper. - Oh yeah we're not starting all that again are we? - Hey look many I ain't starting nothing. I'm finishing something. - What is wrong with you Cider? - You ought to hear it. I told you that hunk of junk back there is held together with rubber bands and scotch tape. - So we'll fix it, we've always fixed it. - We'll fix it, we always fix it.

Sorry I shouldn't have said that. - It's alright Nick I know what you meant. - No I shouldn't have said-- - I know it's alright. [sirens blaring] You're not gonna marry her though are you?

I don't ever want to see another bike again, ever. Just take it away Nick, please. [contemplative music] - Oh no, and just when I think that it's coming to an end, you start all over. Nick. Will you listen? - What? What? - Every time you go out of that door I never know if I'm gonna see you again. Greg's dead. You don't seem to understand that. He's dead Nick, dead.

But until then we ought to just let it hang there man. It's not doing anyone any harm. - Cider if you're not outside in three minutes I'm gonna show Davis complain to the management. [laughing] - Did he really say that man? - I think he did. - When you gonna buy something to wear man? - I've got something better than clothes. Take a look at this. - Wow man. Hey that's not a bike, that's a work of art. [upbeat music] [metal crunching] [music stops] [static buzzing from radio] Wait a minute man. You're not thinking of racing this thing are you? - No no, just a few practice laps see how it goes. - See how it goes? With the performance that thing's got man a top professional would think twice about it. - You'll have to learn it too. - Learn it man look, this is class. Your brother had engineering degree. It needs a backup team the size of Suzuki. - All it's got is you. - Hey man you are crazy. - Hey race track is open tomorrow, what'd you say? - No way. - I'll pick you up at six. - Hey man the answer's no. You hard of hearing? N-O. No. - He was getting ready for Silverstone, introduce it with a bang. Greg was gonna talk to me about choosing a rider for it. - But not you? He didn't ask you to ride it did he? - Are you kidding, at Silverstone? - He didn't want you killed. And neither do I. Carol we're talking about the World Championship. Every nation on this planet represented by the top riders known to man. Guys like that, I'd have about as much chance as Roy Rogers on trigger. And he's been stuffed for 10 years. [laughing] - Okay. So the bikes too good for you. What are you gonna do with it? - Probably wouldn't even qualify. - What are you going to do with it? - [Nick] I don't know. - Well I do, sell the bloody thing. - Hey, I haven't even tested it yet. - Either you get rid of it or I'll go. - Carol. - [Carol] I mean it Nick. [calm music] - Hey. [Carol crying] Carol. It's alright. - It's not. [engine revving] [horn honking] - Hey you hear about the mugger called Arti? Killed two guys, mangled them right. Only got five bucks poor guy. Next day a great big headline in the papers Arti chokes two for $5. - Get out of here. - Come on here break, come on, it's a business. [engine revving] - How was it? - Were you red lining that needle man? - No. - You'll burn it up, ain't nothing bedded in yet. - I know. - You must have been, where were your reps? - Moser, what's on the clock? - Last lap. - So what the lap record is two seconds faster than that. - Your best is three seconds slower. - Hey, you're right. - Good morning, you guys are up awful early. What the hell is this thing? - It's a prototype. - It's a one off. - [Julie] Hi. - Hey. Oh hey that is it, I love it. Genuine leather, hot stuff yeah. Let me smell that. - No come on get out of here. - [Roadie] Are you bothering him again? Why don't you leave him alone? - [Cider] Hey you want me to take this bike now? - Hey mind if I take a look? - [Cider] Sure man why not? - Hey this is light. What kind of frame you guys using? - [Cider] That's a new material, carbon-- - Oh pardon my asking but-- - Where did a schmuck like me get a dream like this? - I didn't say that. - No I said it. - Come on man what's wrong with you? - Excuse me have you got? You see he's got a, oh I thought there was a chip there. No it's not. - Can I have my bike back? - You got it. - [Cider] Hey how many races you guys entered for today? - Just the trophy. I'll see you on the track. - Not if I see you first. - Hey we're here just to test the bike that's all. - Julie let's get some breakfast. - I'll catch up with you later. - Betcha ain't never seen nothing like this before right? - Oh I've seen a lot of motorcycles, excuse me. Can I ask you something? You know he's a really nice guy, and a hell of a good rider. I don't know you but I'd like to know what the problem is. - Have you known him long? - What's that got to do with it? - Ask him how Carl Shorts is these days. Then ask him who Jimmy Prince used to be. - I know who Jimmy Prince used to be. I doubt if you do. So if I were you I would confine my comments to things I understand. - Why don't you shove it? - You looking for someone to smack you right in the mouth aren't you? - Guys like him make me sick. - That explains everything. For a moment I thought you were being unreasonable. - Listen Cider you know it and I know it. He's the most selfish bastard on two wheels. I know of two guys who are vegetables because of him. It doesn't matter what he leaves behind him on the track. All he cares about is coming first. - Yeah? I know the type. - If I smile once more I'm gonna break my face. - [Reporter] Hey come now we've got to have a quote. - Excuse me I have a very urgent engagement. - Listen if the President of the United States were to show up here wanting a ticket would you have one for the President of the United States? Are you kidding? Of course we would have a ticket for the President. Well I got news for you, he's not coming. So can I have his seat? - And then the guy says - And then the guy says that's funny the President didn't mention it when I spoke to him this morning. - He was there. Hey Julie Julie, did you hear about the mugger called Arti? - No. - It's not dirty. - No Ben it's just bad. - It's not bad, you laughed at it this morning. You almost pushed me into the goddamn car laughing. - Hey hey, careful it's not terrible, it stinks. - Why don't you? Go ahead man. - My friend says I owe you an apology. - Your friend is right. - Can I buy you a drink? - Shove it, I think that was the expression you used. - I said I'm sorry. - Oh you did? Well maybe I'm going deaf. But all I heard was that your friend thinks you should apologize. - I'm sorry. - Thank you. This morning in the pits you said something. - It's a habit of mine, I open my mouth and words fall out, you should try it. - You said you knew Jimmy Prince. He was a great idol of mine. I was in the crowd the day he died. - Well there were a lot of others there too. - Yeah Bruce McBride was riding too. - Excuse me. - No wait a minute, what'll it be? I'm an old fashion chauvinist so I'll pay. - [Julie] No thanks. - I'm trying not to be so I'll have a double Scotch please. - [Cider] Hey man where's my drink? - His name's Cider and he drinks Bloody Marys. - Good afternoon, did I tel you you are the second most beautiful thing I've seen today? - Thank you. And I know what you mean. That bike of yours is really something else. - Yeah my name is Cider but I never drink the stuff. - Well I'm Julie Prince, and I'll buy you a Bloody Mary. - Hey alright. See what a little wit, charm, and elegance will do for you? You really gotta get some decent clothes man. [engines revving] - [Announcer] That is a clean start. But it's going for the transfer. As the race line stretches it's come and get them. [upbeat music] [engines revving] He's making a very wide right up here. There he goes right behind him. Sherman has taken the lead with Marshall, Florence, Steed, Kline, then Hass, Davis, Akrin, Jilly B, an outbreak from the Netherlands. Now down the hill, now McBride is coming in. He's coming from the back as the leaders take the hill. Bruce McBride is putting on the plow. Can he really have a close run? Up hill one here now it's the leaders bringing on the point, it's McBride coming up fast. [engines revving] And he's taking him. McBride fast here coming up fast. He's making a fight of it but not for long. McBride shows him what a rear tire looks like. Well alright this is what we came to see. And now number 17 is joining us, these guys are-- [engines revving] - [Nick] Hey show some respect. You're sitting next to a doctor. - You jiving? - Student. - Hey maybe she can look into Davis's complaint man. - What? - [Nick] Ignore him, he won't go away but it's worth a try. - That's where you're wrong. I'm cutting out right after the races. - [Nick] How do I get home? - Train. [tires squealing] - [Announcer] Oh wow there goes Morris. Morris is off the track. Looks like he was hit by McBride. Now he's on his feet, he's walking away. - He's alright, he's okay. - You okay? - So why are you leaving? - Pretty lady I'm dancing tonight. - But it's only 3:30. - When Nureyev comes to Notting Hill the preparation starts at dawn. - Notting Hill where? - In London, a little part of town that's kind of like home. - I know but I meant which place? - Up on Leopard Grove, Sapphire yeah. - Yeah. - You sure you want to be a doctor? Could take years. - [Announcer] McBride on his final leading lap. Just leaves one to get now. And the crowd is going crazy on the far side of the track. Does anybody handle a motorcycle like this guy? Gran Prix race in Germany, black top in Holland. And he's doing it again here today. Transworld Racing McBride in the lead, that's class. Bruce turns into the fairway driving number 15 all the way. [engines revving] [audience cheers and applauds] - Want to go down and shake his hand? - Absolutely. - [Cider] Hey man this is where I cut out. Nick, be cool okay. - [Announcer] If you've enjoyed your race ladies and gentlemen let me remind you that next week-- [engines revving] [all talking at once] - [Bruce] I only held from lap 10 on. I didn't want to take a chance. - [Reporter] That's right, that's right. Save it for the big one. - [Bruce] Hey that guy, what's if Foreman? Freeman, Freeman. Did you check his bike? - [Reporter] Bruce for crying out loud. The guy is a no account privateer. He's got loser written all over him. [laughing] - I need someone to walk up and down my spine. - You need is a hintectomy. - A body transplant. - That's the one thing you don't need. - Not riding today Nick? - Me no. - Bike problem again? - Money problem again. - Ah the big M. I sold my kids last week. Know anybody who wants to buy a mother-in-law? - Stop boosting him will you? Every time he wins a penny ante race I get stuck with a paternity suit. - Penny ante, there was a lot of good guys out there today. - [Julie] Oh you're just saying that to try and make your win sound harder. - My win was only as hard as I wanted to make it. - [Reporter] Hey Bruce. - Yeah yeah yeah. - And take a shower. - Let me ask you something. Imagine you had a fantastic brand new bike, a one off. Where would you go for cash? - You mean spares? Pay someone to look after it, that sort of thing? - Yeah. - Mortgage your mortgage, rent out your girlfriend, then sell your mother-in-law. - Thanks Pete. - Well if it was any good one of the big companies would want it obviously. BMW are always on the lookout. - I want to ride it, I don't want to sell it. - I'll tell you my fantasy, when there's not so many people around. - Nick. Where'd you go? Listen there's a reception tonight and Al Peterson's gonna be there. - Is that good? - Well he does own Transworld. It's gonna be at Bruce's hotel at nine o'clock. Do you want to come? - I will start walking now. - Come on. - It's none of my business but I had you two figured for a unit, if you know what I mean. - Unit? Did anyone ever tell you that you have a quaint turn of phrase? I happened to be godmother to his two little girls. - Where are you studying? - Saint Thomas's Hospital. You gonna hold that against me too? - [Nick] How long? - [Julie] A year starting in the fall. - That's long enough. - For what? - Anything. [horn honking] How long you been driving Miss? - Three days, why? - [Nick] Nice car. - It should be. Cost me almost everything I have. - Yeah, I'd hang on to it. Thank you. - You live around here? - Well just down the block a piece. - Are you embarrassed? - No it's just not the kind of neighborhood you'd be used to. - You know you don't have to cover up for me. I know what it's like. Bring a friend, Royal Garden Hotel at nine o'clock. - And the Sapphire Club at ten o'clock. - Okay. - See you later. - [Julie] Bye.

Linda, Linda? Up yours. [calm party music] - Oh why not go for it man? The greatest rush of all, the last frontier. - Oh come on Bruce. - Why do you think guys climb Everest when they could sit at home and watch TV? Look at Jimmy, I mean hey, Jimmy prince was the highest person I've ever known. I mean you guys forget too soon. He said it, cheat death and you live higher. And believe me he lived it. - That's wonderful really. - [Woman] Did you know him? - Can I talk to you for a minute? - Well apart from the merchandising people waiting outside and the Time Life exclusive, and four strange calls from Tokyo I got all night. - Hey listen to this. Clark told me this one yesterday. Guys comes into his own apartment, sees his girlfriend there, says hey my underpants are-- - Hey hey don't touch me will you, don't touch me. - You're underpants? Your underpants, her underpants were falling down. - Well who's telling this joke man? - [Clarke] Well tell it right. - Okay you're underpants-- - Hey I'd like to get in her underpants. [laughing] - I forgot the joke. - You once said to me that if I ever needed any help or any financial advice that you'd be there for me. Does that offer still stand? - Sure, what's the problem? - Well there's no problem, no thank you. I just feel as though I could act as a catalyst and do two people a favor. - I'm listening. - One person I just met today, the other person is you. - I'm listening very closely. - How long has it been since the basic design of a motorcycle, any motorcycle has been considered revolutionary? - Revolutionary? You mean improvements, modifications? - No basic design. - Basic design? I guess not since the the first motorcycle why? - Look at this. Now I saw that machine on the track this morning before practice. The guy who owns it doesn't have a cent to his name. And he's gonna be here any minute. Could you talk to him?

You can't come in here without an escort. You want to get maced? - Forget all that, where's your brother? - He ain't here. We just had the dance competition and I won. That ain't no way to treat success. - He said he was definitely coming. - [Brother] Can I chaperone you to the bar? - You don't drink Bloody Marys do you? - The whole family does man. - Where's the phone? - Unique is right, uniquely dangerous. In the past two years there have been eight men racing on that team, three are dead, one can't even count to 10. - That's right. And that's what it's about. - You mean that's why they come? - Julie I didn't say that. - Well then what are you saying? 20 million ghouls turn out watch 12 men get their heads smashed to a pulp. - Julie I can't wait any longer. If your man wants to talk have him call me tomorrow. Hey Rose said it's getting late. - [Bruce] You better get right to bed. - Yeah that's what it's about, a $3 million a year-- - Have who call him tomorrow? - Okay so I ride bikes, why should I be dumped on? - One of the mysteries of the universe. - Okay it's dangerous, so is mending a fuse. - Did you explain that to Carol? I mean did you come straight out with her? Honey it's just like mending a fuse. - You know what I mean what is wrong with women? What is wrong with women? - Are you kidding, I'm gay. - What's wrong with women is that there's something missing. They don't have, they don't have. - Balls. - I'm gonna phone another woman. ♪ Where is love ♪ Where is the love your love ♪ Coming down from Heaven above ♪ ♪ From Heaven above - Hello, hello? Could I have the number please of the Royal Garden Hotel? - I mean I know it's none of my business. It's your time. But I think he's a bum, he hangs around. If Al wants to do a deal for the bike okay maybe with Suzuki I can develop it. But this Freeman guy is a loser. And any deal with him personally is out. Who said anything about Suzuki or you? - You said that he was interested in a deal. - I said he wanted to talk to Al. I don't want him talking to anybody until I've had a chance to analyze the bike. Excuse me until I've tested it. Look at Al isn't doing any deals unless it's for me. There's no room on the team for all that chip on the shoulder self pitying kind of crap, even if the guy was good which he's not. You of all people should know that. - Self pity? I'm gonna say something to you. Last year in Colorado you came to me in tears. Jimmy was dead, and it was your fault. - Can you leave that alone? - I never saw more self pity in my life. You were gonna go back to law school, you were gonna be-- - Michael! - You bitch. Didn't keep you out of my bed did it? Last year you come to Colorado and you got what you wanted and you come back here for more. You wanted him dead, well you got him dead. Where you going? - I never wanted him to die. - Julie. - I loved him. - Alright. - You took advantage of me when I needed someone. - Okay that happened a long time. - Don't you hate yourself? - No I don't because it is over you hear me? Just leave it alone! - Well I can't, ever! - It's a deal. [engine revving] [tires squealing] - What's going on? - What's it look like? [metal crunching] - Here you go, you've earned it. - If you want to ride my bike [punch lands] ask me. [girls squealing] [punches landing] - Crikey, you alright? [yells a war cry] [punches landing] - Come here. [punches landing] - It's Nick. - I'll take him. [punches landing] What are you doing lady? Get him out of here. [sirens blaring] [punch lands] [sirens blaring] - I've seen it before, it's a kind of death wish. And from what I've seen you're just a walking disaster looking for someplace to happen. - [Nick] Thanks. - Okay. Before I leave there's just one last thing I want to say to you, you stood me up. You made a fool out of me when I offered to help. And that really pisses me off. - Yeah well-- - And don't give me that line about how your girl moved out. Because if you treated her the same way I'm surprised she ever moved in. - Your patients are gonna love you. - Sure, and I probably couldn't have gotten you the money either. So there I've saved you the trouble of saying it. - Look. I'm sorry about tonight really. - Don't be because we'll both survive. - Well with your qualifications that won't be too difficult will it? - Fine go ahead, feel sorry for yourself. Feel sorry all you want, but not on my time. - Your time? This happens to be my time too. I didn't ask you to come here and deliver a bloody lecture. - Can I ask you one last question? - That's your second last question. - Touche, why aren't you happy? - I am happy, who says I'm not? - You do, your attitudes and your sour jokes, you do. - Is the mercy mission over now? - Mercy mission, why don't you call it a kick in the ass? - Kick in the ass, consider it kicked? Do you mind if I get some sleep? - Oh you're not asleep already? - What's that supposed to mean? - Who came on with all that bullshit about how much you admire Jimmy? How you could have been world class too if you'd only had a chance. - Yeah. - And who wanted me to find a sponsor? And who couldn't make one lousy phone call to let me know that he wasn't coming. So don't tell me you're fighting to get to the top of the pile cause you're just jerking off. And what are you doing? Why are you here? Medical genius saves unknown slob doesn't add up. - You're right. Good luck with your bike. - Wait a minute. All this wouldn't have anything to do with a certain guy with 64 teeth who thinks he can walk on water would it? Got it, McBride-- - Is hell. - You don't have to say another thing. I was there, I saw your husband die. I know what they did, it's the oldest trick in the world. You box a guy until he gets so mad, he gets so mad he kills himself. [Julie crying] It's called legitimate tactics. Now you're looking for somebody to beat the hell out Bruce McBride. [Julie crying] Okay. You found him. [contemplative music] [speaking in foreign language] - Hey good morning Mrs. Buonaguidi. [speaking in foreign language] Hey listen, could I interest you in a second hand racing bike? TS 500, good trim, racing slicks, the works. Well you'll change your mind when you see it. Wow man what did they hit you with? - I want to talk to you. - She did a good job didn't she? - How come you know? - My brother told me. - Where were you last night? - In the damn van. - Who with? - Your bike. - You're kidding. - Hey man come on you know what my neighborhood's like. - You slept with the bike all night? How'd you make out? - A lot better then you by the look of it. - Yeah well that's what I wanted to talk to you about. I need a favor. - You want his ass. - Yeah I know it's short term but today's a bit special. - Yeah it always is. Hey wait a minute, McBride's girl? - That's just the point, she's not. - Boy can you find trouble. [upbeat music] - [Nick] I'm sorry I shouldn't have asked that. - Oh that's okay. I don't exactly like talking about it. But at least is not unbearable anymore. You know what does make it bearable? Even if Jimmy had known that he was gonna die that day he would have gone out on that track anyway. You know what I mean? - Oh I know what you mean, I understand, completely. - The great god Speed. - It's the only show where the clown's paid to entertain the crowd. - I know it. Do you have migraine headaches? - No, then you can have it. [laughing] - How long will it take to be a doctor? - [Julie] Seven years. - Oh dear that's a long time. - Well what did you think it took, a couple of afternoons and a good memory? - [Cider] Julie, Julie. - [Julie] What? - Man, man you supposed to be putting out the, hey look you doctor, you can help us put this thing up here. - Yeah turkey you're a doctor? - What do you mean yeah turkey you're a doctor? [children laughing] Hey Nick, come on over and help us man. I'm gonna get this tied up. - Why don't you try relaxing? - Oh man. - That might work. - Interesting. - That's what I meant. You can see here the frame that's a very very light frame. It makes in its own way rather special. - Special. - Yes. - Yes well, what exactly do you want me to do? - Overdraft, you know back me. - You mean for manufacturing? - No not straightaway it'd have to be proven first. - [Al] And how do you propose to do that? - To ride it a Silverstone in the World Championship. - I see. - You see if I can just, it's a unique piece of engineering. If it does well on the track then as you will know the sky's the limit. - And that's where a manufacturer could come in. - Absolutely. - Why don't you go to one? - No, they'd want to take it over, that's not what I want. - But as you said they'd pay a fortunate surely. - I want to ride it. You see if I do well with the bike then the world will see a new kind of bike. - Looks like he's free, you can go in now. - Hey hope you haven't invented the Concorde or something. He'll ask how many feathers it's got. - I don't know but I've been down to stores. He's never there. There he is. - Right. Nick, Nick I want a word with you. - Okay okay Wiggy don't say a thing. I know I'm late, I should have told you. I'm not worth the money I'm paid. You don't want to buy a TS 500 do you? Brand new slips, ready to race. - Does it have Newcombe plates? - I don't believe it, just stride it over. - No no no now listen Nick, Nick. It's chaos in there. Everybody's had to get their own spares. You broke my faith Nick. - [Nick] Well a man is only as tall as-- [upbeat music] - Keep saving those tapes buddy. - So one more day like this and you're fired. That's the managements position, that's official. There nothing I can do. - Stop worrying Wiggy. They'll never be another day like this. - Look Nick it's not me anymore. Don't you understand what I'm saying? - I know what you're saying. You're saying the people up there riding you. You shouldn't have let me keep the bike here. Blah blah blah. - No Nick it's not that. It's not only about the bike, it's a lot of things. - [Nick] What things? - Well the way you run this place. I mean long orders and things like that. That's the real reason. - He's coming out of the straight away, sorry Ma'am. - That's why they're doing it Nick. - Doing what? - Putting you on the pumps and transferring Davis in here. Management's gonna tell everybody at four o'clock. - On the pumps out there filling tanks? - I said it wasn't me. - It's not me either. - I'm sorry Nick, really I am. - Do me a favor Wiggy, tell them to shove it. - Nick. Nick. Nick. [engine revving] Don't do anything stupid now. [engine revving] - A tornado. - Will you look at that? - Hey Davis. Why don't you, why don't you watch television like everybody else? I'll see what I can do.

It'll save a lot of misunderstanding and I'm all for giving quick decisions. Business agreements have a lot to do with collateral. It's a matter of who pays for the scheme if it fails. Now companies can put up their factories for collateral. Individuals can put up their houses. - Mr. Benson here and he told you that he doesn't own a house. - No he's got something much better. - The rented room. - The motor bike. Of course I should have to see it and get expert advice but if it's as good as it looks on paper I'm prepared to put up 4000. In a year from now either you pay me back 5000 or I take the bike, manufacturing rights, patents, the lot, what do you say? Do I take it we have a deal? - [Nick] Yes. - Good, well let's go and work out the details. [contemplative music] One day I'll let you see the real thing. - The real thing? You mean off all these motorcycles are yours? - Yes. I'm a collector. That's why you're here isn't it? [upbeat music] - Do you believe it, I mean really believe it? - Absolutely? - Neither do I. [laughing] [metal grinding] - What's happening? - I'm making it six ounces lighter. Hey don't step on anything. - You sure you know what you're doing? - [Nick] I once took my grandfather's watch to pieces. - Oh okay then you'll be fine. - Had to throw it away in the end though. - [Julie] But you're older now. - Not a lot. - Listen I got you your carburetors. - Carburetors. - And your brake, brake pipes. - Brake pipes. - [Julie] And your pads. - Paddy wads. - I ran out of cash and they wouldn't take a check. - Why not? - [Julie] Don't know me I guess. - Yeah it's understandable you look a bit suspicious. Then I went to Barton Motors. And I think you better sit down before I tell you this. - Don't tell me they can't do it. - [Julie] Oh they can do it, trouble is they won't. - Won't, what do you mean? My brother spent thousands at Barton Motors. They've still got the casts, everything, dyes. I'll give them a call. - Hold it, before you call them I think I ought to tell you something. - What's that? - [Julie] Your brother owed them money. - So we'll pay, how much? - [Julie] 3,000. - Can't be Greg always paid, he paid everything. - They showed me the bills, 3100 and that's without interest at 3% of month on account of late payment. I got some food, you want to eat? - Why, why didn't they say this before? - Because Barton's thought your sister-in-law still owned the bike so they held the bills back. My dad always says as one door closes another door slams in your face. - I know but it's not the end of the world. - No take 3,000 from the 4,000 Benson lent me. I need new disc valves, a standby frame. It's bloody impossible. Well there's always a way out. Let me call Benson. - Benson you didn't read the contract? I guaranteed there were no legal or money problems. I signed a document to say that the bike was free of debt, I was free of debt, the whole world was free of debt. It's about the only thing he insisted on. No need for physical, enter any race you like, but is the goddamn bike really mine and is it free of debt? - Nick listen to me. Sometimes I think I'm really crazy. And maybe you're a little crazy too. So what are we trying to prove? You lost your job. - I walked out. - And that was my fault. And now you're in debt and I guess that's my fault too. I started this, I don't even know why anymore. - Just to show him, just once. - You're not listening to me. I am trying to tell you that I was wrong. That I was just trying to get back at somebody. I was trying to find maybe a gladiator I don't know. I just wanted to hit out. Can you understand? It doesn't matter anymore. - Well it does to me. - Well don't let it. I came back to start school again. And Bruce just happened to be here. - Bruce, who gives a shit about Bruce? - So if it's not important-- - It's everything. Ever since I can remember it's the greatest race in the world. [contemplative music] - Nick I'm sorry. What can I do? - Tell everyone how I almost raced at Silverstone while I'm filling their tanks. - Sorry. [glass breaking] - Hey he's a maniac you know that? He's crazy. - That's not what I asked you. - Alright he's the best driver I've ever seen. - Cider it's important. - Look Nick is like a brother to me okay. Club races, small circuits, we've had some good times. But Silverstone, baby that's something else. - Look maybe you think I'm as crazy as he is. But if I go through with this will you help him? - Julie, hey look girl you want some cheesecake or an apple or something? - You're not answering my question. - Hey you mind if I ask you something? - [Julie] Go ahead. - You haven't, I mean you're not like getting too involved with Nick are you? - It didn't start out that way. - [Cider] Yeah but it is now right? - I don't know maybe. Look Cider all I'm asking is if I go through with this will you stand behind him? - Well suppose they don't give me the time off? - Well why don't you ask? It's the most important thing in his life. - This is crazy. - Please Cider. - Only because you're so pretty alright. - Now we're all crazy right? - Yeah but some of us are elegant, witty, charming, and handsome too remember? Grab your food. - Hello dad. - Hi Nick. What you doing here? - I just thought I'd say hello. Have you got a second? - Ben, check four and seven for me will you? Won't be a minute. - I know you're busy I won't keep you. - What is it son? - Well I thought I'd drop in. - Listen Nick you haven't been down here since you were a kid, what's wrong? - Money mainly. - How much do you need? - I wouldn't ask you for money Dad you know that. - So what is it? - Tina gave me Greg's bike, she told you. - What the big one? - Yeah. - And it's not paid for is that it? - No, well yeah but that's my problem. No I wanted to ask what sort of personal thing Dad. I spent half the night walking around thinking about it. Now I'm here, I don't know how to ask. - Listen Nicky I've known you since the day you were born so don't piss me around, whatever it is just say it alright. Okay, why did you give up boxing? - Is that what you came to ask? I got too old. - No you've always said that, I worked it out once. You were only 26 when you left the ring. - Look I don't know what's brought this on but when you got a family you don't mess with dangerous sports. I mean some do, not me. - So if it hadn't been for us you would have gone on? - Ben why's that red light out? Look Nick I've gotta go. - You would have gone on? - I might have why? Oh I get it. Carol's pregnant. She wants you to give up the racing game is that it? Comes to us all in the end. - You would have gone on Dad. - I'd have been the bloody champion if I'd gone on. And that's the truth. - Yeah. And I'm gonna embarrass you. I love you. Good night. [contemplative music] Hey. - Hey. - What's all this? - Did you see everything out there? - Yeah listen, you mind telling me what's going on? - You're going on. And if you don't get into training soon you're not gonna make it. You got three weeks. - But where did all this money come from? - The car, I sold my car. - You shouldn't have done that.
