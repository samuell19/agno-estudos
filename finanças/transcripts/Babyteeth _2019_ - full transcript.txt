Smoking is not allowed at this station, or on the train. Like everyone's wearing strapless to the formal now so... Yeah, that's good, 'cause it's a bit, like I don't know, that would suit you. I reckon I'm going to say something to Mrs. Martin. Seriously, she need to get her scales right and everything, like... No! You can't! Dickhead! Milla! - Doors closing, stand clear. - Milla! Damn! Your hair's like, uh... What? Your hair's like bangles or something. Bangles? Like with the light, it's like bangles, it's... Damn. Yours is nice too. Yeah, but look at this. Look at that, see. I cut myself. See? I had to get on like a weird angle to get to that bit. - And then I... - Can I feel? Yeah. - Feels like snakeskin. - Ooh! Yeah. Oh, shit, there's blood... Oh! - It's so stupid. - It's okay. I'm just gonna wait over there. Shit, it's gone on your... - Oh no, it's fine. Seriously. - It's gone on your shirt. Here. - Happens all the time. - Just lay down for a minute. I got you. Passengers on platform four, the next train... You just find a little bit of sky. Sorry, could you just take it off my face. It smells. - Is there blood in my hair? - Nah. - Oh, there is a lot of blood. - Get up. Hey, um, I hate to ask you this um, I've just been kicked out of my house and... - Evicted? - Yeah, evicted. And, uh, I just, I'm sort of trying to put some money together to get a bed in a shelter for the night... Why did you get evicted? Just because I got behind in my rent. I hate to ask you. You just seem like a really nice person. How much? Uh, just whatever you can manage. It doesn't have to be much. Just 'cause I saved your life or whatever. - I've only got 50. - Fifty! That's too much! - I can't... - I can split it. Uh, no, no, no. Fifty's okay. Hey, you want to take this one? If I give you 50, you have to do something for me. You know she's playing easy listening in the reception? No wonder your patients are so tense. - Is my time up? - Not quite. I'm just boring you. - It's quarter past. - Yeah, alright. - Really? - When's your next client? 4:30. It's just she tends to be early. Oh, let's just do it. Don't you think? It's the last thing we're going to feel like doing next Tuesday. Hm! Hm! While I remember... Take one of these with food. These are the same things that are in the blue bottle, yeah? And, darling, start taking an Ativan in the morning as well. Just for the next few weeks, alright? - I love this bra. - Hm. Couch or desk? Hm? Oh. She looks like a little kid here. Do you know that was five years ago. I don't remember this being taken. She looks so pissed off. - She does not look pissed off. - She does. That is, no, she does not. It's the sun across her face. That is practically a National Geographic standard photograph. How are you doing with that sandwich? Many of my patients have said that it looks like a professional photographer. Yeah, but they are crazy, Henry. She's gonna be okay. - Can you just move your leg. - Yeah. - Does that hurt? - No, babe. I've got to answer that. - I have to answer that. - Uh-unh! Really? I'm sorry. Uh, can you just get her last MRI scan ready for me please? No, there's a more recent one. There's a more recent one than that. But that's... that's the one. - Are you okay? - Mm-hm. - You gonna pick her up now? - Yeah. I'll see you tonight. Oh, fuck. I love you Fuck! - We've got to go. - Why? Wait! My violin! My violin. Duncan Abrahams is big but he doesn't throw himself in. Oh, I know. Hello! Hello! Oh, I know, I'm sorry we left you... He's got reach, but he can hardly... Come here, Zach. Mum. Hey, Zachy. Uh, I'd like to report a break-in. Fuck you, mum! You've got... ...little trimmings on your face. They're like, so pretty. - Like little gold... - Just have your water, mum. What's it called? Is this a... style? I was going for rat's tails. You're a hairdresser, are you, Moses? Mum trains Bichons. And that's how you know about rats, is it? That's why I've got access to clippers. They're poodle clippers, but I use them on me as well. I mean, you get a result you're happy with using poodle clippers? They're just like regular clippers, mum. Bit louder maybe. They're probably a little bit less accurate, I imagine. No. No. We were competitive. Mum's a three time state award winner with her bichons. Oh, wow. How old are you, Moses? - I'm twenty... - Sixteen. - ...three. - Twenty. I'm twenty three. Well... I'm a bit freaked out by that. But, um, lucky for everyone I forgot I'd taken a Zoloft when I took two Xanax while I was waiting for you at the hairdresser to show up thinking you must've been abducted because why else would you not even come? We know that she's okay now. Don't we? - God, two of those blues. - Right? Those ones you gave me. Though I'm feeling very relaxed right now. Feels like we... I'm havin' a stroke. I can't feel this. You look like a different person. Good. What have you done with my daughter? I killed her. Oh, my God. She's got a great shaped head for it. We were nervous. I mean, well, I was. I was nervous, because she was very overdue and had to be, have those, um... What's that word? Um... What do you call 'em? What's... what's that word? The... Henry, what is the, what is that word? - The... - Vase. - Vase? - Forceps. She had to be induced but then they used the forceps. And she started pulling them right up inside me because she did not wanna come out. And I was ripped to shreds. - But we got in here, and we... - Oh, my God! Anna. Anna, let's go for a walk around the block. Sorry, Milla. I am so high, right now. You've got blood in your mouth. - What? - Your mouth is bleeding. Oh, fuck. I've had this loose tooth. Not a baby tooth though, only Milla has baby teeth. And it's an aberration for someone as old as me. Which one is it? This one. At the back. - Show me. - There. Oh! Hi there, little guy! - Get away from her! - Mum! Ahem. Sorry, Moses. Don't apologies to him for me. - Why is he even here? - He's my guest! N... no. No smoking. - Not in front of Milla! - I'm sorry. - Outside! You take can it outside! - Mum! Mum... Mum, he... You don't, you don't have to go outside. Do you have that, um... Oh, yeah. Um... Yeah. Here. Here. Thanks for dinner. - I'll see you round. - Where? - Around. - You don't have to go. Henry! Henry! Fucking hell. It's a bit flat sweetheart. - It's still a bit flat. - Henry! You fucking mongrel. Henry! Who is she? We're gonna have to move. Henry! We're lucky Gidon can fit us in this morning. Maybe he can give you some theory you can carry on with. Tell Ann that we're still aiming to do the exam in March. Milla! What's wrong with you? What do you think's wrong with me? You can't treat things like this. What about you? You were disgusting yesterday! Mill! That boy had problems! So do I! Bye, darling. - Hey. - Hello. Oh, shit! Shit, shit. Fuck. Fuck! Bit of ash. You shouldn't smoke, yo... you know that. - Yeah. I need both hands. - No. Because, you know, you're pregnant, so... No, they did a study about that, actually it's totally fine as long as you don't smoke tailor-mades in the first trimester. - Are you serious? - Yeah. - I read it online. - No, that's bullshit. There's no such thing as a safe cigarette. It's not bullshit, I read it online. Thanks. See you round. Henry! - I've lost my dog. - Hm. Probably just out, you know checking out his new neighborhood. Yeah. Hopefully not stuck to someone's bumper. Henry! Henry! - I'm Toby. - And I'm Henry. I... that's my name, Henry. - No, you're not. - Yeah. Henry James Finlay. But Henry's a dog's name. Why didn't you say something? - Bye, Toby. - Bye, Henry. Go to hell. Truly, I never hear anything like, huh. Everything you touch you destroy. Hm! Oh! Here we go. Who did this to you? Huh? My boyfriend. Ah! You have boyfriend now? What kind of boyfriend give you mange? Well... ...he's actually a wild dog. You know, with this new look, you need something... ...you need something like... ...something like this. Eh? Hm, hm, hm! Try, try, try. Yeah. Hey. Where your brother is? Hey, why are you not at school? You want to wait in here? Inside? Come on, come on, yeah. Yeah, come on, come on. Come on. We have biscuits! We have coffee! Dancing girls! - What's your name? - Tin Wah. Taking the day off school, Tin Wah? - Missed the bus. - Yeah, right. Ah, you know this? Eh, here. Put your chin here. Like that. Yes. Comfortable. Comfortable. Shh! Don't move. Don't you fuckin' move. It's okay. Don't come any closer. Shh! Don't move. Don't fuckin' move. That'll just make you feel sick. That'll just make you sick. These ones have got codeine in them these ones will make you feel calmer. - Mum! - Ah! Just get out. - I won't tell anyone. Go! - Mum! Coming sweetheart! Go, go, go. - Milla! Henry! Henry! - Shh! Hey! Shut up. Shut up. - Just get out! Get out! - Alright! Milla, don't come in here. Go back to your room. Now! Moses? - Oh, Milla. - Are you ripping us off? Oh, this is so bad. - Oh, God. - He was in the kitchen. - Have you called the police? - No! When would I have had a chance to call the police, Henry? If you call the police we're totally entering the cycle of abuse, Henry. That is 100% your fault. Please, dad. I won't be able to respect you if you do. What's his... What's your surname? I'll call his parents. - Please don't. - He's been thrown out of home. - It's complicated. - His mum's troubled. Then I have to call the police. I just don't think that's right for him. Milla, he threatened me with a meat prong. You threatened my wife with a meat prong? No, I wouldn't have done anything. Mum, I'll... I'll do anything. I will. I'll... I'll... I'll practice the violin and I'll go to support. And the fucking formal, I'll go. Can he just please stay? Anna, we can't do this. He was remarkably inept, Henry. And he's probably harmless. He's a drug addict. Don't pigeonhole him like that. Hey, thanks for being so kind to me. You're so kind to me. - I lost my hair. - It looks cool. It's like way better than the one that I gave you. Anna, if there's no consequences he's going to be back here again... - Anna? Anna! - What? I just need you to listen to me and think this through. I didn't invite him here, Henry. The boy is desperate. I was dreaming about you actually when you came in. You were dreaming about me? Yeah. N... not... No, we weren't doing anything... You were just... ...you were just sort of... there. It's morning. He could stay for breakfast. Milla! Breakfast. He must have fallen off his bike or something. He's got this scar. - Morning. - Morning. Sit down. - Sorry about last night. - Do you have a girlfriend? Uh, I wouldn't call her a girlfriend. - How old is she? - She's 26. Sounds very appropriate. - You're making crepes? - Mm-hm. Well, well. So, Moses, what have you got planned for the day? You, uh, you working at the moment? Not in any formal way. And, um, informally? What do you do? All different things. Oh. Mm-hm. You think there's something that I should be doing? No. I don't think the world would be this big or weird if we were meant to choose just one thing. I think as soon as people start doing that they become obsessed with functionality instead of is it beautiful? Hm, it's true. That is what happens. I'm not ready to be functional. Of course that doesn't mean you have to be dysfunctional. Henry! What is it you do, sir? He's a psychiatrist. I guess you think that you can pin me like that. - Mill, you better get ready... - Having my breakfast. Sorry. Don't leave. I can drop you at home after this Moses. Oh, no, I... I don't want to put you out... No, no trouble. I can do it after I've dropped Milla at school. Hey, Moses, I don't know if you make a habit of this or not that is befriending girls that are significantly younger than yourself. But Milla's in a very vulnerable situation... Goddamn. Fuck! Henry, can you grab his collar? - Yeah. - Sorry. He's a car-chaser. No problem. Hey, um, can you come and stand on a stool for me? - All my lights keep blowing. - Um... I don't trust myself within five meters of a stool at the moment. Um, I've just, I've got... - I've got patients that are waiting. - Okay. Okay. - See ya. - Bye. Henry. I wanna see you again. No way. Milla! Okay, bye, mum. You'll let me know and I'll come and get you if it's too much. Bye. - Where do you live, Moses? - Uh, just drop me up here. Oh, no, I'll take you home. Thanks for the lift, Mrs. Finlay. Moses! Thank you. I don't want you near Milla again. Yes, alright. I felt my, my body go cold. Like I knew. If I'd have just said... God, if I'd just said don't. If I'd just said don't leave me... J... Jenny can I, would you just ex... ...just excuse me for one moment, please. Mm-hm. I'm gonna change that bulb. - Thanks. - Right. Um, hold on a sec. - Got it? - Yeah, not yet. Ah, there we go. - Fuck! - Fuck! Fuck! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God. - No, no. The electrics in these houses, they're fucking crazy. - Can you sit down? - Oh, no, I'm okay. I'm so sorry, Henry. I'm so sorry. - Sit down. Please sit down. - I'm okay. - No, I'm okay, I'm okay. - Please, sit down. - I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm fine. - God! - Hope you're not brain damaged. - No, I'm fine. Can I get you some water? Do you want me to get you some water? - I'm fine. - Fuck. Are you allowed water? What's that rule with hair dryers? Oh, you can see straight into our house. - Really? - Yeah. Okay. Can I just... - Yeah, I'm fine. - Your hair's sticking up. Can I just... Can you wait a second? Wait, I've got something that will be perfect. This is gel, but it smooths the hair. Um, can I... Okay, you do it. Just don't be shy of it, i... i... it goes completely... Actually, no, let me, here. Was that your boyfriend dropping you off this morning? Yeah. Are you bringing him to the formal? Think so. What school does he go to? He's left school. My boyfriend's 18. I love your wig. I wanna get extensions for the formal. - Cool. - Yeah. - Can I try it on? - No. Just to see how I'll look with long hair. - Just for a second. - No. Please? I'll be quick. I'll give it right back. Please? Ha-ha. Yeah? Oh, my God. I look so different. It's to show my hairdresser. Oh, yeah, I love that. It's better on you. Oi! - What're you doing here? - What're you doing here? - It's my school. - It's my school. It's an all girl's school. - Shit. Hey! Stop it. - Milla? - What? Where have you been? - Ah, with Scarlett. - Hey, sweetheart. - Hi. - Feeling okay? Mm, okay. You should invite her over. Or is her mum still paying her to be on that paleo diet? Mum, um... ...I need some money for tickets to the formal. - Okay. - Okay. We'll have to go shopping for a dress too. Do you have any... any ideas? Mm-hm. Maybe we could take tomorrow morning off and... ...go shopping. I don't want to miss any more school. Are people taking partners, or... Oh, don't! Th... that's because foreign policy in this country is based on this small mindedness. Would you like me to ask Andrea's son? Leif? I'm not going with Leif. ...especially about this strange effusive character that was Mozart. It's unique music for expressing tragic sentiment. Always with open-eyed wonder for the world. Never is it cynical. It can be dark, it can be menacing but essentially it's extraordinarily optimistic music. And when Mozart is at his peak and sometimes he doesn't always reach his peak but when Mozart does write at his peak such as the "25th Symphony" you're dealing with something that's indescribably extraordinary. Um, this is an exploration of the music of Mozart... I think something in you is changed. What could it be? I see the same in your mother when she is in love. Is when she is becoming drunk with it. When she met dad, you mean? - You were crazy about her. - Of course. - We play Shostakovich together. - Were you together? You never observe this crescendo. - Were you? - Look. How many times I underline. You're not so breathless this time. Come, lifting the wings... When you play this with focus it can make the heart so big. When you do bird calls is so stupid. What're you looking at? Piss off Hi. Hi, Mrs. Finlay. Is Milla here? - No. She's not. - I brought her these. I brought her a present. You weren't in school. I didn't go today. Did you run here? I've been playing basketball. - Do you want to do something? - No. She has to rest. - We can sit out back. - No. Milla. Milla. - What are you thinking? - What? Well, can't you see the state he's in? Sorry, I couldn't find a cup. I wanted to ask you something. Uh-huh. Will you come to my school formal? Aren't I a bit old for it? No. Do I have to wear a suit? I don't think so. I'd like to wear one. Oh, my God. My heart's beating so fast it feels like having a heart attack or something. Feel that. I didn't think it would be like that. - I think I'm going throw up. - Hey? Mum! - Mum! - Are you alright? Can you get me an Ondansetron? Sit up. Sit up. Sit up. Can you sit up? Milla. I know you have it. It was right next to the phone. Give it to me right now. That's not it. Will you still come to my formal? - No, he won't. - Sorry. - Mo? - No, he won't Milla. Have some self-respect. Is that why you hang out with me? Yes. Is it the only reason? Is it? You have to leave Moses and you can never come back here. Sit up, honey. Sit up, honey. Come on. Have another sip. Fuck! Fuck it! Fuck! - Yeah, nice. Yo. - Hey, Mo, Bambi's here. Hey? The hell are you doing here? What the hell are you doing here? Does your mum know where you are? Does yours? You can't hang. I've got to go to work now. Tracy Marrow? Yes, sir. - Cheers mate. - Yep. My brother's doing a party tonight. You should come. Alright. Where's it at? - Brian's place. - Oh, yeah. Hey, we won't stay here long, okay? Unless it's really fun. You're really pretty. I love this. Are you avoiding me? No. Good. Hey, Mill, do you want to... Mill? - Do you wanna go dance? - Yeah. I'll meet you in there. Are you babysitting? Hey. Hey. Can you get me a drink? Hey. Hey! Are you drunk? - Where's your girlfriend? - Hey? Where's your girlfriend? Hey, look at me. Look at me. Fucking loser. Hey! Fuck! Fuck off! Hey! You okay? What is this? What did you take? Mill? Vodka. Are you allowed to drink on your medication? It's never come up. - I'm gonna ring your parents. - No. No. Not yet, Mo.

Moses, do you like me? Obviously. But do you like, like-like me? Hey. It's complicated. I don't wanna hurt you. So don't. I'll be back in a minute. - I'm coming with you. - No, no. No, no. Go back to sleep. Go back to sleep. She didn't take any of her medicine? I hope he doesn't just stick a needle in her arm. Why did she not at least take her phone with her? Come on, Milla. How did we not see this coming? Henry? Did you hear me? I'm up with her every night, Henry. Her body gets so hot. You're never there. I am. I'm there. I'm always there. You just don't notice. Well, I can't find you. Even now I have no idea what you're feeling. 'Cause you don't tell me. Tell me Henry, because I feel so alone right now. This really isn't about you, Anna. It... it... it is. It's really not about how you feel! This is about Milla, for God's sake! Wh... what's wrong with you? Our daughter has disappeared. She might not make it through the night and, and, and a... a I can't feel anything because I can't breathe. 'Cause you take up all the air. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. Okay. Anna, I'm sorry. Anna, darling, I'm sorry. I just want to find... Excuse me. Have you seen this girl? Excuse me. Can you just look? Excuse me. Have you seen this girl? Ha... have you seen this girl? Let's go home. Oh, baby. Not yet, sweetheart. You've got a chest infection. Please, mum. We have to get you better first. It won't take long. - You always say that. - It's true this time. You say that too. Mill! Mill, stop it! Milla! What, are you trying to kill yourself? He won't find me here. Milla. Come on, darling. Come back here. Come on. He... Henry, can you come and feel the water pressure? Henry? Darling, I checked it this morning. It was fine. Well, it's very weak now. Can you come and feel it. Henry! I felt it this morning, it was fine. Henry, just come and check the water pressure with my concerns in mind and see if it's too weak. It's just a basic conjugal duty. Jesus! Hey, there's water there. Don't slip. Hurry up. Come on, I've got to get to the hospital. Milla's obsessed with that boy. - She's a smart girl. - This is her first love. - She'll get over it. - You don't just get over it. I'm pretty sure that she won't be strong enough to save herself. - She's not like you, Anna. - I'm not saying that she is. What do you mean? - It's fine. - No, it's... Exactly the same the same as it was this morning. - Have you taken your Ativan? - It's still weak. Have you taken your Ativan? Because you'd better. - I don't take them anymore. - Since when? Since Milla came back. I'm off everything. No, no, no, no, no, no. Uh-uh. This is the worst possible timing. I don't want to miss anything, Henry. I'm fine without them, you know. - Just my back's been... - No. - What're you doing? - You're just exhausting. Okay, it was the shower, Henry. It's reasonable. No. It's not reasonable, Anna. It's... it's, it's not reasonable Anna. You just, you cannot cannot, cannot, cannot, cannot lose it yet. You cannot. Mm-hmm. Ah-ha. But you see, uh, uh, this violin is mine. It's too big. Milla learned that song. Yeah. He is in love with her. - No, I'm not! - You are. You don't know yet. Eh. Here. Here, go and get yourself a coffee, uh or whatever you like, huh? Come back with longer arms please and we will work more. What? It's good to see you. Can you turn... Can you turn to face the piano? Please. Come on. - Mm... - Come on. Oh, stop it. Anna, please. Play with me. I don't want to. I believe you do want to. Hm? Gidon, stop... Stop it! We can fight if you want to. Is that why you come? Do you remember when we were doing the Sculhof how I couldn't go on? Hm. - In Hamburg, remember? - Hm. Milla was five months... ...and I left her crying with that woman I couldn't even understand. I wasn't ready to stop then. I should have been the one who was holding her. I want that time back. You think Milla will get better if you stop playing? I don't have anything else to give. Fuck the tiny gods in your head, Anna. Milla's mother plays the piano. Hi! Henry! Henry! Henry! Fuck! Henry! Motherfucker. I unpacked the cups last night. Do you wanna come and have a cup of tea with me? Well, what... Uh... W... what have you been using for the last month? Jars. - You alright? - Yeah. Me too. This baby's such an asshole though. He's kicking me all the fucking time now. Hm. Come here. Oh! That's his bum there. Is it? Yeah, there... And shoulder. Ah. Oh-ho! It's quite lively. - Did you feel that? - Yeah. He likes the sound of your voice. Yeah. I'm... sorry. It was nice. - Shit. - No, no. It doesn't matter. Sorry. Uh, sorry. - I brought you some... - Yeah, I don't... I don't wanna talk about it. You don't get to do this, Henry. Um, I can't... talk. Um... How long has this been going on? I just can't talk right now, honey. - What? - It's the first time. - It's the first time. It's... - What? Uh... It's just morphine. It's just a little bit of morphine. It's alright. It's okay. We're losing her, aren't we? We're losing her. What the fuck are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? Moses! Moses, I just wanna talk. No, no. I just... I just wanna talk. - Whoa! Whoa! - I just wanna... I said I just want... Henry! Henry! Henry. Is... Is she dead? Is she dead? - No. - Is she de... Oh! What were you doing? What are you doing leaving there in the middle of the night? What kind of... What kind of fucking person are you? And I came back. I did. I came back for her. It all just got fucked. Will you come and stay with us? I can get you what you need. What? I don't like you. But Milla thinks you're something special. She should have the world at her feet right now. I can write you prescriptions. Come and stay with us. Ow. Who did this to you? - It was your dad mostly. - No, who did it? What? What the fuck... Oh! It was you! No. Just some dickheads. - And your dad. - No. Do you want another beer, Henry? Oh, you're on wine. - Anna? - No, thanks. I love those chrysanthemums. They're just like such an explosion, aren't they? - Hm, they're dahlias, actually. - I love that color. It's so deep... Excuse me. It's so deep in the middle. Dad! No! That was with food falling out of my mouth! - Well, take another one, Henry. - First, let me finish. - Okay. - Ready? Mm-hm. Oh, that's nice. Oh, that's very cute. Hold on. There we go. - How's that? - Milla, give me a look... Get your... Oh, no, that'll do it. - Okay. Okay. - Alright. Alright. Just... I'll get some more dahlias tomorrow. Oh, no, I think we're okay for flowers. Oh, you have to just go for it with dahlias. The... the... the season is so short. - I know. - Uh, like, uh... It's like horse mushroom season. My dad used to say that horse mushroom season was, like, the best time of the year. It'd be good to meet your dad sometime, Moses. He'd love that! - Uh, outside. - Oh. - When's horse mushroom season? - Huh? No idea, darling. No idea. Stop! Anna? I thought I heard something? Did you? No. It must have been my imagination. Anna? Hey, what detergent do you use? Are you sleep talking? No. These sheets smell so good. I forgot what it's called. Do you wanna know now? It can wait till morning. Moses... ...does your mother know where you are? No. Don't you think she'd like to? Milla said she used to sleep under the piano. Yeah. She did. She liked the feeling of the vibrations. She used to just... curl up underneath. Like this. And wrap her whole body around it. You get some sleep. - Milla? - Mm? - Can I sleep with you? - Mm-hm. Ah! Fuck it! It was good, Mo. He just needs to let go of some of the tension in his... He's just a perfectionist. - Mum, play with me? - I-I don't know. I... We can play the "Le Cygne." - I think you should rest. - Mum, what do you wanna play? I just... I just I want you to get better. I'm going out for a bit. Can you keep your eye on them? Yeah. This is the worst possible parenting I can imagine. Okay. Hi. Can you put these in water for me? Mill? Do you still wanna take him to your formal? Do you want to? - Try it on. - Oh, my God. Try it on. Try it on. Try it on. How is it? It's perfect. Turn around. You look so beautiful. Maybe we could just put a dart... I just wanna show Mo first. I love it, mum. You are my dream girl. Mo, I just found this thing under my arm. - What sort of thing? - A lump. Do you know what it means? Really, um... - What's wrong with you? - Nothin'. Are you stoned? Henry sorted me out. - Henry! - But it's cool. - Henry! - What is it? What's he... - You've been drugging him, dad? - Oh... - Well, it's nothing illicit. - What? To keep him here? - No. - No. It just... It's pres... Just, just prescrip... Prescribed by you, dad! You've... You've made him into some kind of hooker. - Well, sex isn't part of it. - Did you know? You'd given up on everything else. You think I can't take the fact he doesn't love me back? You can't treat people like that. Yeah, but Mill, it worked. You're so stupid! You... you think you can fix things by handing out drugs. I mean, my God. I have no idea who she is. You keep her so fucking high. I'm off everything actually. Except I had a half a sleeping tablet last night. You think you can fix things by paying off some junkie? You think that's what I need from my dad? Oh, Mill, it's not what this was. Mill, I'm not here 'cause of the drugs. - They're shit anyway. - Why are you here? I care about you. You're lying. You're always a million miles away going "What can I get out of this person..." You're just being nasty. When I met you it was like... I can't believe it, it was like... ...you weren't scared of anything. But it's because you don't give a shit. I mean, all that crap about horse mushroom season! Do you even know? Do you even know who your father is? Fuck you. You're so fucking perfect. Uh-huh. - You think you're so perfect? - No, I don't. You lie all the time. You wanna tell them? - What? - She's got a lump. What? She's got a lump. Milla? Is that true? Get the fuck out! Get the fuck out. Go! Stop wasting my time! Hey, Zachy. Hey, come and open the door. Well, come on. Isaac! Come on! Hey, I just wanna see you! I thought you were my mate! You can't keep doing this, Moses. Milla... ...if you die I don't know what I'm gonna do. - I'm going to scream. - Can you just hear me out? I never went camping with my dad. I stayed with him one time, one Christmas and he hardly even talked to me. He was working in this restaurant where he was fucking the manager in his car every night and I had to wait in the carpark until he was finished. I never told mum. I told her that we slept in treehouses and shot birds. I want to be with you... Milla. I don't know how to do this. I win. Oh! Did you cheat? Yeah. Do you wanna eat that? Can we just do one more, until I win one? Okay. ♪ Oh put some more sauce ♪ ♪ On my fajita ♪ Mum... Thank you. What? - What's this? - This is a little sangria. - A little bit of birthday. - Oh. Little bit of birthday happiness. And he's making... ♪ Fajitas ♪ - What! - Ow! Oh, my God! It is so good! My God! When are we having the cake? When you have eaten all your greens. Hey, Mo. I've heard that you're a really good dancer. Could we... ...maybe watch some of your moves? - No. No way! - Isaac said... Isaac said you did it at a Rock 'n' Roll Eisteddfod. Isaac! What the... What are you doin'? You were really good. S... so I told her. - For my birthday. - Don't pull that card! Oh, you can't refuse the birthday girl. Go on, pussy! He is pussy! Alright. Everybody, ready? That's it. That's it. Yeah, that's it. - That was excellent. - Mum? Will you play with me? Bravo. Bravo! Bravo! - Bravo. - Hey, Henry. - Can you sedate him please? - Mm-hm. Do you... Do you have a car? - Of course. - Okay. Shh. - Is Toby having her baby? - It's all good. Oh, my God. Oh... Um... Tin Wah! Tin Wah! I don't think I can take another morning, Mo. - Do you want some morphine? - No. Will you do something for me? You know I will. Will you take this pillow... ...and just hold it over my face? If my body starts to tense or it looks like I've changed my mind, just push harder. That's just what bodies do, something in it fights but it's not me. Hey, I'm not gonna do this. Don't leave it unfinished. Wait until my hips drop open and there's no hold in my spine. Then you can take the pillow away. Hey, if you want to kill yourself get your dad to give you too much morphine. It would kill dad. This way I just stop breathing. No. Fuck no. I know what happens from here. This body, it's too much. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. And it just... It gets more painful, Mo. Please don't ask me to do this. Please. I need you to help me. - Can I have a sip? - Yeah. I'm sorry, Mo. I know you love me too. Not any more, I don't. Don't stop pushing. Your body has to bear me down. Okay? Ow. You okay? [breathing heavily[ You birds are crazy. - Should I make crepes? - No. Don't you like my crepes? No, they're fine. They're just always such a big deal. Well, I don't make them as punishment. Oh, this cake is disgusting. Do you think they're having sex? I do. Did you hear something? Oh... Can you just knock on the door and give her this? - No! - Come on. Just... Henry, come on... - No. - Just... Just give the door a little tap. Okay. - Good morning, sleepyhead. - Good morning. Is Milla awake? I didn't hear her in the night. Did she sleep through? She, uh, woke up at about 4:00. And then she went to the, went to the toilet. She didn't need her morphine? - No. - That's great. That's like the first time in about six weeks? That's, that's great. I was going to make you a tray to have in bed. Just gonna finish my cigarette. Oh. I thought you could eat together. Doesn't matter. She's got to get up and eat something in a moment anyway. She was dead already. You come in here and you... And I woke up and she was, she was already dead. She looked peaceful. Not now she doesn't. She doesn't look so peaceful now with her eyes rolled back like that. - I closed them. - Well, they opened! Why didn't you call me? Why didn't you tell me? We could have... We could have... We could have... We could have resuscitated her. She might... She might... maybe she... She was dead. She was already dead. Will you stop smoking in my house, you fuck! You fuck! I didn't get to say goodbye. She didn't say goodbye to me. You come in here and you smoke us out. You! You're the one who got to hold her you're the one who got to have her last breath. And you use it... And you use it all up! I didn't say goodbye. I didn't say goodbye. Alright, hey, are you guys ready? Ready? Ah, ready? One, two... Sorry. - What did you do? - Sorry. I accidentally went like this. Okay, you ready? Isaac! Isaac, come and be in the photo. Sit in the middle. Middle. - Middle. - Oh, Jesus. Seriously, mum's got a bit of hypervigilance about the beach, mate. Go. You all ready? Got it. Got it. Come here, mate. - No. - You're coming with me! What're you doing? What're you doing? - How is it? - No, no, no. Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Here we go. Oh, my God! Oh, yeah, I got this idea. Okay. Okay. This is good. Mill? You ready? I'm tired, Henry. Darling, I know, but, but you can just... Dad. I'm tired. You know we'll be okay. I'll take your photo. - No, no... - Go. - Go and stand over there. - No, dear, it's okay. - I want to do it. - Alright. Well, do you know that t... to do the focus you do, the, um, the outside wheel and for the finer points that will be the fine focus, and then obviously that's the shutter. I know how to use it, dad. Yeah, okay. But just y... you might want to wait 'til... Will you look after Moses, dad? Yeah. Are you going to smile? Um, just give me a minute. I'm going to enjoy becoming part of a sky like this, dad. Hey? You okay? Are you ready? Yep. Yep. One, two, three.
