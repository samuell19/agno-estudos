Hello I'm doctor Andy Jackson. I've been leading biblical tours in Turkey for many years, but today is a very, very special day because I'm going to be meeting a very close friend of mine doctor Mark Wilson who's the author of a very popular book called "biblical Turkey." Twenty years ago we journeyed through Turkey together and now we have an opportunity to go and explore the ancient greco-Roman city of Ephesus. I'm sitting here in a beautiful location near the aegean sea it's the bay of the modern city of izmir and this is biblical smyrna. And so here I'm waiting with a lot of anticipation to meet Mark and also to have you and invite you to join US on this really unique time of exploring Ephesus. Oh there's Mark now. Andy good to see you again. Been so long. Yeah welcome back to Turkey. I'm so excited 20 years ago. It's hard to believe isn't it? Time's moved so fast. The first time we traveled together through Turkey, you remember that? Absolutely. That was my first time in Turkey. I was just beginning my own doctoral studies working on the seven churches. On the other side of that now and as you know in 2004 dindy and I moved here to this city, ancient smyrna; lived here six years and now we're in antalya so it's been an amazing journey for US. And it all started right here with you in 1992 on that trip. We still look good. I'm really looking forward to this trip together to discovering and exploring Ephesus with you. It's going to be a great journey so let's head down there now. Absolutely. Let's get going. Mark both of US have lived in Israel and studied the life of Jesus and the gospels, but it's amazing to me how many people do not realize that Turkey really is the focus of the new testament. About two thirds of the new testament is either written to or from Turkey. We have most of Paul's missionary journeys taking place here. And of course you have western Turkey with the seven churches of revelations. So, so much new testament takes place in this wonderful land. Absolutely. This is such a beautiful land. Just 10 years ago majority of Turks didn't even know that they were living in the land of the new testament. I remember that. One story I don't know if I told you, but I have a friend who was driving through Turkey maybe 15 years ago, and he picked up a Turkish hitchhiker. And he was talking to him and the hitchhiker asked my friend, "well what are you doing here?" And he said, "we're driving through the journeys of Paul, the apostle Paul." And well the hitchhiker goes, "who's the apostle Paul?" And he goes, "well he's one of the main leaders in the new testament." And then my friend asked him, "well where do you live in Turkey?" And he goes, "tarsus." Yeah, Paul's home town. Paul's hometown. That kind of a good example at that time. It's getting much better though. Well let's take off. Yeah. Mark as we explore Ephesus there's going to be a lot of topics that we're going to be able to discuss. And I know one of the topics I wanted to focus in on is the three years of ministry that Paul spent in Ephesus, the longest he spent anywhere in any city I'm really excited to look more into his three years of ministry there. Yeah I agree. We got a great adventure ahead. One of the things I'm looking forward to is our visit to Patmos where John received the revelation. So sometimes you get a little seasick, but I'm hopeful we'll make it okay. Yeah I'm looking forward to that boat trip. And then just how John received the book of revelation and also the seven churches of the book of revelation. And I think that's very important as we talk about and as we travel into Patmos and we go down to Laodicea to discuss a lot about the seven churches of revelation. Yeah so after Paul dies John becomes the leading figure in the church in Ephesus. And I think just the fact that Ephesus is the center of early christianity and biblical christianity, and there's so much that would be applied to our own faith today and overcoming in our faith, not being conformed to the culture around US. So I think that we're just going to have a lot of topics to discuss and it's really going to be a rich time. I agree. It's really going to be a great time. Now we've got the whole history of the sights before US. This is a beautiful view of Ephesus. Yeah the whole history of the city is built around these three hills. Peon in the middle, coressus on the left, and then to the right ayasoluk. Yeah and Ephesus was located in a different location, a different time in history. The ionian's settlement was over there in mount peon. Then they moved over to the temple of Artemis area, the Libyans and the persians. And then from there... Alexander the great comes through... Yeah Alexander the great and then... Then general lysimachus moves the hellenistic city between these hills. We can see the incredible walls from the hellenistic period here on top of mount coressus. And then in front of US we've got the Roman forum that they developed. And of course another thing we can see is the route of the sacred processional from the temple of Artemis through the magnesium gate and then down through the city. Yeah then later on as the goths came in and destroyed the temple of Artemis and then the byzantines moved out right over here to where the Saint John's basilica is located. And then after the byzantine Ephesus the Turks came in and conquered and that was over the area there; that would be Turkish Ephesus. So this gives US a view of all of the history of Ephesus. It's a beautiful view. Here we are at one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. It's the sight of the temple of Artemis of the ephesians. It was one time larger than a football field. Today it's just an open field with a column because the goths came in ad 262 and destroyed it all. But what's your thoughts about what it looked like during the time of Paul and John and the early christians that lived here? That was a tremendous sight. It was like a forest of a 127 columns, the largest religious temple in the ancient world at the time. It functioned four ways within the city. It was a repository for civic decrees. It was a bank. It was an asylum for fugitives. And of course its most important function as a religious center and it was from this temple that all the sacred processionals that regularly went through Ephesus both began and ended. Andy who's this interesting figure you've got in your hand? Yeah this is a replica of the goddess Artemis and this is the type of replica that the priests of Artemis used to take and walk into the sacred processional through Ephesus; the upper city down through the lower city. And from here the visitors could have looked through the temple and saw the original standing in the center of the temple. The apostle Paul in his third missionary journey heading to Ephesus went across the Roman province of galatia to Laodicea when he entered the province of Asia. Then he came up the meander valley to the city of magnesia; up to where we are right now as he was heading to Ephesus. Paul must have been extremely excited when he reached this point looked up and saw this magnificent triple arched, architectural structure, read the bilingual Greek and Latin inscription that's above US telling him that c. Sectilius Pollio had built this aqueduct for the city of Ephesus dedicated to the emperor Augustus and tiberius. And after weeks of travel his destination was soon to come. Yes. Very, very close to Ephesus. Let's go on up. Here we are amidst the thistles and thorns looking at the important eastern gate of the city, the magnesium gate. And this connected Ephesus with its sister city magnesia on the meander about 15 miles southeast. And through this gate the sacred processionals related to Artemis came into the upper city. Paul came down from Laodicea down the meander valley then he went right through this gate into the city of Ephesus. Let's go. Wow here we are. Two million people come to Ephesus each year now. Mark this is a big open area. This is upper Ephesus. What role did it play in the city of Ephesus? Well this is the governmental center of the city called the civic agora or the Roman forum. Acts 19 we read that the town clerk intervened in the riot and his offices would have been in this area. He also mentions courts would be in session. This is the area where the courts would have taken place in the city. Here to our right is the bulletarian; the town council would have met here; so a very important part of the administration of ancient Ephesus. A really impressive area of Ephesus. Roman emperor worship what a lot of people would call imperial cult was very much a part of the religious environment of Ephesus. And Paul and John would have interacted with emperor worship in Ephesus. And here we are at a place that is very well known for emperor worship. We're looking at what archeologists believe is the sanctuary to divus Julius that's the divine Julius Caesar and thea roma, the patron goddess of the city of Rome. The Greeks worshipped living emperors as divine beings. However, the romans wouldn't do that. It was only after the emperor died that they would begin to worship him. So when you read in the book of revelations chapter 12 about the two beasts; when you look at the woman seated on seven hills in revelation 17 mystery Babylon, this is all related to the imperial cult worship that took place in a city like Ephesus. The imperial cult emperor worship was such a part of Ephesus and we have so much more to see. Let's go see. A lot to see. Oh Andy we're coming into the mission square here. This is an incredible sight straight ahead. Even how high this is up here is quite amazing. Yes it's a massive infrastructure here, substructure here that they built this temple on top of. This imperial cult temple we're looking at of course is extremely important for the history of Ephesus. In the first century bc, around 27, the Greek assembly authorized the first imperial cult temple in the province of Asia and that was in Pergamum during the reign of Augustus. In 26 ad they built a second temple in smyrna during the time of tiberius, but the Roman senate wouldn't give Ephesus an imperial cult temple because the prominence of the Artemis temple. And it wasn't until the end of the first century around 89, 90 the emperor domitian built this temple. And it's the area just right here below is just the lower structure, substructure. The temple actually was on top and this was a massive complex of emperor worship and the imperial cult. And this was built at the time that the apostle John was living here and ministering here. So I'm sure that was something that was really... The Christian community here when they saw this being built must really stirred up some emotions as it relates to the true living god versus the Roman emperor. That makes an important propaganda statement that Caesar is lord over this city. We're looking at a very important scripture here related to the imperial cult. It talks about Ephesus being the first and the greatest Metropolis of Asia but it also mentions the second neokoros of the second temple warden of the emperor here. And this is the key word, neokoros, that we find in acts chapter 19 talking about Ephesus as being the temple keeper for the temple of Artemis. This column summarizes the religious essence of Ephesus because it has emperor worship on one side and it has an image of Artemis on the other side. And I think with both of them together it summarizes really the religious context of Ephesus. The internal identity of Ephesus is the imperial cult and the worship of Artemis. And when we put them together on one column it really summarizes what Ephesus is all about. Mark you wrote a book on the theme of victory in the book of revelation which is a very important theme for US as christians today becoming overcomers in our faith. Can you tell US a little bit about that? We especially see it in the letters to the seven churches and they conclude with promises to the Victors and the churches for overcoming. And this theme of victory is epitomized especially in this relief of the Greek goddess Nike that's behind US. She's holding in her left hand the victory wreath that's awarded to the winners of the various games that were held in cities like Ephesus. In her right hand she's holding a palm branch. And when you see the Victors in heaven from every nation people tribe and tongue gathered around the throne they're holding palm branches in their right hand. So the symbols that she has in her left and right hands are very important imagery for understanding the book of revelation. And we want to be overcomers. Absolutely. We're standing in front of this incredible structure; the reconstruction of the library celsus. One of the most interesting parts of this is a menorah graffital that's on the step leading up to the library. This graffital, of course, tells US that we've got Jews living in this city which we know from literary sources like josephus the Jewish historian. 10 times he mentions the fact Jews lived in this particular city. Right. And it's a tradition of Paul wherever he went whatever city he went to he'd visit the synagogue first and that's true in Ephesus. His first visit to Ephesus from Corinth he visited the synagogue. And then when he left he came back and the first thing again he went back into the synagogue. So we know the first christians in Ephesus were Jewish and most likely they became believers at pentecost in Jerusalem because we know that Jews from Asia were located at that time. So we know the earliest church in Ephesus were Jewish. By the way do you have any information on where the synagogue might be in Ephesus today? Well the Austrian archeologist has been working here for a hundred years and unfortunately haven't found any signs of the synagogue or even very few other objects related to the Jewish community. You can't wait until they find that. Acts 16 tells US that Paul on his second journey is wanting to preach the gospel in the province of Asia, but as he gets into this area the holy spirit directs him northwestward to the port of troas. Now if we read between the lines Ephesus is his destination. It's a perfect place for him to set up his ministry; fourth largest city in the Roman empire, capital of the province of Asia, a large Jewish population, transportation hub, both land and sea, and of course the center of Artemis worship here. But from troas then he goes over to Macedonia and from Macedonia goes down to Achaea and ends up in Corinth. Yeah and after spending about 18 months in Corinth Paul along with Priscilla and Aquila and probably his team come across the aegean into the port here and then they walk into the great harbor road that we're on right now. And the first thing that they see when they enter Ephesus is the great Roman theatre of Ephesus. Paul must have been very excited. Over two years since he'd set out for this place he's finally arriving in Ephesus. We're standing in the terrace houses in downtown Ephesus and this is the area where the elite of the city would have lived. Behind US is the home of Furius Aptus and these homes were built first in a first century ad and lived in for several centuries. And in this type of environment the early christians would have held their meetings. Yeah when we talk about the church in Ephesus during the time of Paul and John we're really talking about numerous house churches. And in 1 corinthians chapter 16 verse 19 Paul makes this clear when he writes, "the churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. "Aquila and Priscilla greet you warmly in the lord and so does the church that meets in their house." This is a pear style type home, the public space where visitors would come and it's in this area the early church would meet. And you can see from its size maybe 40 or 50 people could have gathered. And it's in this type of a space that the worship of Jesus Christ would have taken place in the city of Ephesus. We're arriving in a very special place in Ephesus on the hillside above the city related to Saint Paul so let's go ahead and enter. The depiction of Paul we're looking at here is the earliest portrait that we have in Turkey; dates from the late fourth to early fifth century. You can see his name paulos to his right. It shows a scene from a later Christian document called the acts of Paul and Thecla. Here Paul is preaching in the city of iconium and Thecla is listening to his message out the window and accepts the message and becomes a believer. And in the acts of Paul and Thecla we have the earliest and only physical description of Paul that we have and in this portrait we see that. He's bald headed, his eyebrows are meeting and his nose is hooked. Yeah and it's very interesting to me that we would mention that during the time of Paul and John that the churches met in houses, house churches. And after John they started, here in Ephesus they also started meeting in caves, in cave churches, and this is a perfect example with this fresco of Paul. This is really well preserved right here. Absolutely. Probably the best one of the preserved ones. So this is really an interesting cave. We see some of the inscriptions on the walls over here on the side. A little bit of a grotto or some kind of a thing right here. Paul tells US that he taught publicly in house to house. We know that he spent three months in the synagogue and then he moved to the hall of tyrannus and he taught for two years. It's a very interesting tradition related to Paul's time at the hall of tyrannus. Daily life in a city like Ephesus began at sunrise and ended at noon. So Paul would have been working at the commercial agora as a leather worker, tent maker, in the mornings then in the afternoons he would move into the hall of tyrannus to engage with visitors to this city, the residents about the gospel of Jesus Christ. And it was during this period of time that he reached so many people in the province of Asia. Yeah I think a lot of times we envision Paul lecturing for two years behind a pulpit kind of thing, but actually the Bible tells US that he engaged in discussion; Questions and answers and really a discipling approach, and probably engaged a lot of his coworkers. Apollos and Priscilla and Aquila were involved in the training of those that were part of the school. Another dimension of Paul's time during this time of course is a concern about what's going on in Corinth. He's beginning now to hear about the problems developing in the church and hearing the body life of the church in Ephesus as they're dealing with spiritual gifts and other issues he's getting a background that he's later going to be writing in his first letter to the corinthians addressing these issues. He had Corinth on his mind. What's exciting to me about this gate, Andy, is it was standing here in the first century during the time of the apostle Paul. It was dedicated to the emperor Augustus by two of his freedmen. We can see their names mazaeus and mithradates, and on a regular basis while Paul was in the city he would go through this gate on his way to the commercial agora. Let's go on in. Yeah that kind of reminds me of the story of when Paul was with Priscilla and Aquila and they had a leather business trade in Corinth. And then when they came here together it's most likely that they set up the same leather trade right here in the commercial agora. And Paul spent most of the time when he was in ministry actually doing leather trade. So it's quite a location, this fantastic commercial agora. It's also the area where one of the most famous incidents in acts 19 take place; related to Demetrius and the silversmiths. And why was Demetrius so upset with Paul? Well when Paul first came here there were just a handful of Jewish believers, but after three years in ministry there was large numbers of Jews and non-Jews coming to the lord. And there was a real movement that was really affecting the religious environment of Ephesus. And Demetrius says this: "And you see and hear how this fellow Paul "has convinced and led astray "large numbers of people here in Ephesus and in practically the whole province of Asia." So it was outrage. It was not so much just having to do with the religious affront to Artemis, but it was affecting their pocketbooks; unable to sell souvenirs to all these religious pilgrims who were in the city. Demetrius and the silversmiths must have started the riot getting involved others around them and they would've gone out this exit here as they made their way then to the theatre where the disturbance continued. Now we're heading up to the great Roman theatre of Ephesus that held 25,000 people. Demetrius and the silversmiths initiated this disturbance; others out in the streets joined them here and there's sort of a mob mentality prevailed and most of the people joined this group going into the theatre not even knowing what they were doing. Total confusion. They just rushed right in here. Wow this is incredible. Can you imagine the confusion, the pandemonium that was going on here when this crowd assembled in the theatre, 25,000 people shouting great is Artemis of the ephesians? Two of Paul's companions in here. The shouting continued. Some of the Jews in the city tried to put their leader to speak. He was shouted down. Absolutely chaos. Yes it was. And what was Paul doing during this time? Well Paul wanted to appear before the crowd in his defense, but the disciples didn't let him. Even from the officials of the province, friends of Paul, sent him a message begging him not to come into the theatre. What's so interesting about this of course is the sound goes out to the harbor. Nobody in the upper city could even hear it. So finally word gets through these crowded streets. The town clerk he makes his way down here trying to bring this crowd under control. And of course the thing he threatens them with is that they are rioting against Roman law. And he says, "we're going to be in big trouble with the romans if we don't bring this riot to a close." And of course he does that and settles it and the illegal assembly is over. Yes and because of this big scene of this Artemis riot it seems like this motivated Paul even though he was planning to leave soon anyway to go ahead and depart out of Ephesus and onto Macedonia. Wow what a view. Yeah it is fantastic. Yeah it is. Mark 250 miles straight across from here is the city of Corinth. And Paul spent a lot of his time when he was in Ephesus with preoccupation with a lot of the things that was going on in the corinthian church some of the problems they were having, that kind of thing, writing to them actually visiting them. Well it was a very complicated situation. As you know with the corinthians this is unmentioned in acts 19, but we see that some of the church wrote him a letter about the problems, representatives from the church came who discussed with him some of the problems, and then in this context while he's in Ephesus Paul writes the first letter to the corinthians. And he continued the relationship. Even in the 1 corinthian letter he said, "I'm going to come and visit you." And he did. After the Artemis riot he takes off and he spends three months with them. So Paul continued to have a heart for the development and the growth of the church in Corinth. We're traveling through the very waters to which Paul passed on the end of his third journey. He's traveling with eight companions including Timothy and Luke. And he's decided to bypass Ephesus. He's in a hurry to reach Jerusalem trying to get there before the day of pentecost. They stopped at the island of samos which is behind US and the next day they make their way down to miletus. Somewhere along here he decides, I cannot leave the province of Asia without seeing the ephesian elders one more time. Yeah in acts 20 when Paul is talking to the elders he gives them... Up to this point, most of the opposition towards Paul's ministry has been outside of the church. And now he forgets and prophesies that there will be false teachers that will arise among them. And I would like to read Paul's own words in acts 20. He writes, "guard yourselves and all the flock "of which your holy spirit has made you overseers "you Shepherds the church of god "which he bought with his own blood. "I know that after I leave "savage wolves will come in among you "and will not spare the flock. "Even from your own men will arise and distort the truth "in order to draw away the disciples after themselves. "So be on your guard. "Remember that for three years "I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears." And then this comes true when Paul was released from prison out of Rome and he returns back to Ephesus with Timothy and he leaves Timothy in Ephesus to deal with a false teaching that now has arisen within the city of Ephesus. That's a very important change in Paul's relationship with the ephesian church isn't it? Very true. Very true. Mark we got on a boat early this morning in Ephesus and probably four hours we've been traveling across the aegean sea and we come to the island of Patmos. How far actually is the island of Patmos from Ephesus? We're about 75 miles southwest of Ephesus. Today Patmos is a Greek island. In the first century it was part of the Roman province of Asia. It's a small island, about 13 square miles shaped like a kidney bean. Many people ask this question and I know I often think about it: What was it like on the island of Patmos when John lived here? We really don't know much. Patmos is mentioned hardly at all on literary sources; probably very similar to the way it looks today, a bare desolate rocky island. We know there was a Roman Garrison up in the acropolis area, small population of Greeks who live here on the island at this time, but it was pretty much isolated forsaken place then. So John lived in exile in an isolated location and this is where he received the book of revelation. Hey Mark, this is a great place for US to sit and have a chat. Sounds good. The second half of the first century ad the early church faced three significant challenges. First after the fire on Rome ad 64 nero was looking for a scapegoat to pin the blame for the fire on and the christians were a very convenient target. And the first major persecution of the church now occurs in the city of Rome. And according to tradition both Peter and Paul are martyred at this time. And shortly after in judea the Jewish revolt takes place in ad 66. And pretty soon Rome of course is sending troops led by the general vespasian to try and put down this rebellion that's going on among the Jewish people. And then suddenly in the Roman empire after nero commits suicide we have four individuals who serve as emperor during the year ad 69 called the year of four emperors with vespasian emerging now as the emperor of the Roman empire. Right. And that sets the setting for Jesus' warning to the disciples on the mount of olives his last week of his ministry where he says, "when you see the romans surround Jerusalem flee the land." I think this is the motivation that John took some of his community, some of the believers, and actually left Jerusalem and went to Ephesus. And there settled in Ephesus and he had a 40 year ministry in Ephesus where he wrote first and second and third John and the gospel of John. And of course here he came to Patmos and here wrote the book of revelation. Here we are Andy at the church of the apocalypse and according to early Christian tradition one of the most important events took place in a cave around which this church is built: John received his revelation of Jesus Christ. What does the book of revelation tell US about the circumstances of this event? Yeah revelation 1:9 John gives US a very distinct statement of why he is on the island of Patmos. It reads, "I John your brother and companion "in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance "that are ours in Jesus "was on the island of Patmos because of the word of god and the testimony of Jesus." So here's John really expressing his heart of identifying with the suffering of the christians in Ephesus and in the seven churches of the book of revelation. Does the book of revelation tell US anything about the occasion when John received the apocalypse? Yeah there's a specific passage, revelation 1:10, where John gives a very clear description of how he received the book of revelation. It says, "on the lord's day I was in the spirit "and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet, "which said write on a scroll what you see "and send it to the seven churches: "To Ephesus, smyrna, Pergamum, thyatira, sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea." There's all kinds of interpretations on what it meant to be in the lord's day and in the spirit. What are your thoughts on that? Well, this is the first of four occasions, we're told John was in the spirit when he received the revelation of Jesus Christ. Look at the surroundings where we're at in the first century. A very bleak desolate situation for him living in a cave and suddenly now the lord takes him up to show him these incredible visions of what's going on in heaven. So this was a total disconnect from what his life was here on the island to what was going on in the heavenly places. That is quite a lord's day. We're going down the meander valley, beautiful valley here. We're going to Laodicea and one of the things that I think we over see a lot of times in the book of acts it describes the results of Paul's ministry in Ephesus is that all the Roman province of Asia heard the gospel, all Jews and gentiles. And the Roman province of Asia was about the third of the area of modern day Turkey. And at that time most likely the seven churches in the book of revelation was planted. I was just wondering what are your thoughts on that? Well there's certainly more than seven churches in Asia in the first century, but Ephesus, smyrna, and Pergamum were the three most important cities so naturally they had churches. Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea were secondary cities. We see the route of the order of these churches following geographically a road that would have made a circle around that would end in Laodicea. As you know Andy the number seven is a very important symbolic number in revelation and kind of links back to the menorah, the candlestick with its seven bowls, and we see Jesus walking among the candlesticks there in revelation chapter one. Yeah it's twenty years ago I remember when we were at Laodicea there was just nothing there. So I'm really excited and I'm sure you are as well to just see the new discoveries, the new archeological work that was done in Laodicea. Absolutely. Let's just enjoy the beautiful meander valley. Laodicea became a very wealthy city in the first century due to strategic geographical position. Also its textile production contributed to its wealth as well as the banking enterprises that went on here. In ad 60 when the major earthquake devastated the city Rome offered to help rebuild, but the laodiceans said, "we're wealthy enough we can rebuild it ourselves. Yeah and I think the pride of riches also entered the mindset of the church because Jesus rebukes the church of Laodicea in John's revelation where he says, "you say I am rich. "I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing, "but you don't realize that you are wretched. "I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in fires so you can become truly rich." And he certainly seemed to have adopted this attitude of self-sufficiency that was in the general citizenry at large. Mark one of the most familiar verses in the letter to the laodiceans is this: "I know your deeds that you are neither cold nor hot. "I wish you were either one or the other. So because you are lukewarm neither hot nor cold I'm about to spit you out of my mouth." And over the years we have heard a number of different interpretations of this imagery. What is your understanding of this passage? It seems to refer to the water situation of the city of Laodicea which is behind US here. We're standing looking at the water system that actually brought cold spring water from an underground spring about three miles to the south. You can see it's a double channel of stone that brought water to a water tower again behind US that distributed throughout the city. So much of the year this water would've been very cold water going into the city. Also behind US you can see the white travertines from the city of hierapolis which sat above them. And this is a great spa center. Even in antiquity people went there to get treatment for various ailments and benefitted from the hot mineral spring water that was there. And then just to our east is the city of colossae. Above that city sat mount cadmus, a very high mountain that most of the year it had snow on it. And so when that snow melted that fed into the lycus river that flowed into the meander so these images, the geography of this city lends very much to helping US to interpret this passage of hot or cold and lukewarm. And clearly lukewarm is a negative image there the way Jesus uses it. We just left Laodicea through the ephesian gate on our way to Ephesus. Yeah right outside the ephesian gate it this very well preserved Roman bridge and Paul would have passed along this way on his way to Ephesus on his third journey. The messenger that brought the book of revelation to Laodicea also would have taken this same road to Ephesus which is about a hundred miles ahead of US. Well here we are Andy Saint John's basilica. Let's go see it. Now this was byzantine and Turkish Ephesus. And this is the acropolis. This is actually a defensive wall that was built around Saint John's basilica. Many people confuse Saint John's basilica with this wall, but it's actually behind the wall as we enter up. What's interesting to me is all those recycled stone that comes from various buildings in Ephesus. I see freezes, column fragments, even some inscriptions here built into the wall that they've brought in something called spolia. Well we're looking here Andy at the incredible ruins here of Saint John's basilica. We can see over here from some of the temple remains as we walk around over here. As you know Andy scholars date the writing of the book of revelation either early around 69 before the destruction of Jerusalem or late around 95 before the death of John. Regardless of which date we hold to we know that John came back to Ephesus after his exile on the island of Patmos. Yeah and when he came back he re-established and built up the church in Ephesus and also in the Roman province of Asia. And he became known as the apostle of love. In 1 John he writes, "dear friends let US love one another "for love comes from god. "Everyone who loves has been born of god and knows god. Whoever does not love does not know god because god is love." Well let's go visit the grave of this beloved disciple. Mark many people in our groups asks US if this is the exact place where the apostle John was buried. Well I think he was buried here. The early christians in Ephesus preserved the memory for centuries that John was buried in this necropolis or cemetery of the city. Then in the early fourth century they built this very simple four posted ciborium that we're looking at here that is covered by a dome or canopy. Then in the fifth century we have a church built over the tomb, but that was destroyed by an earthquake. And then in the sixth century the emperor justinian builds this magnificent basilica over the tomb. So we can say this is the exact spot. I think so. The temple of Artemis used to be the great drawing place of pilgrims from all over the world, but it was destroyed in ad 262. So when this was built and the tomb of John this became the pilgrimage sight for christians from all over the world. Yes it did. We've had a wonderful visit to Ephesus Andy and I was wondering what do you think the legacy of the first century church here is for christians today? Some of the most important early Christian leaders lived and ministered here in Ephesus. We know Paul did, apollos, Priscilla and Aquila, Timothy and also some of the most significant letters of the new testament were written to or from here. Paul wrote 1 corinthians. We have an ephesian letter, first and second Timothy. And also John wrote the history letters and the gospel of John. And then of course the message in the book of revelation was written to here. By the way I was wondering in there it says that the lamp stand could be removed. What's your thought about that? Well I think the translation there would be better if it said the lamp stand would be moved because many visitors come here in your groups too and look at the spiritual situation here and think nothing happened after the first century, but we have a very rich history in Ephesus following that period. We have Ignatius passing through the province of Asia in the second century writing a letter to the church here around 110. And through this period of the first several centuries there was a lot of persecution that took place generally in the Roman empire. But after the legalization of christianity in the fourth century we have third ecumenical council taking place here in Ephesus. And of course the growth of the church is going along with many important developments in the history of the city here. The harbor began to be increasingly silted and not utilized, plagues happened here, earthquakes periodically bring great destruction and so we see the church though continuing through this period. So even with all of these obstacles the church continued to grow and develop and as Jesus said, "the gates of Hades will not overcome the church." And so the theme I think is great to finish on here in Ephesus is one of victory, that we are to be overcomers in our faith and certainly that's the legacy that we see here in Ephesus. For me it's really been great to be back in Turkey with you again after over two decades and to re-explore Ephesus. A lot of changes have taken place here, but we've made some wonderful fresh discoveries that we missed the first time around. Mark I've really enjoyed exploring Ephesus with you.
