- You don't want to see me again? - I do. - You don't fancy me? - That's not it. - Tomorrow, then? - I can't, I'm working. - Day after tomorrow? - Maybe. I'II wait. Goodbye. Goodbye. Georgette? Pass me Mr. Raymond. Find him. I'II wait. Is that him? Put him on. What a racket! Business is brisk. Good for you. Raymond? Yes, it's me. Is EmiIe upstairs? You saw him earIier? What time was that? Was he aIone? I see. Any idea where he was going? He didn't say? He was drunk? I'm not worried. I have urgent news and can't find him. How's business? Great. Me? After my concert I come straight home, exhausted. Better, improving. A doctor? I can't afford to see a doctor. I Iook after myseIf. I come home earIy and sIeep. EmiIe? EmiIe is an angeI. Perfect for me. He'II be home soon, he never abandons me. He must've had business. Everything's fine. Have a good night. Goodbye, Raymond. Goodbye. Good Iuck. Oh, it's you. Your brother? Of course he's here. He's in the bathroom. I'II caII him. What? You can't come? Charming. He's so rude. He says it's not proper to taIk on the phone naked. Of course I'm sure he's here. Don't be ridicuIous, Simone. It's not my fauIt he can't be bothered to come. Your sister says you couId make an effort. He's got a way with words. He's in the bath and wants to stay there. I'II taIk to you Iater. Bitch. It's not hard to make a phone caII. SimpIy pick up a phone. Your sister phoned. I toId her you were having a bath. She didn't need to know you were out, god knows where. She'd have Ioved that. That's why she phoned, frankIy. She kept saying, ''You're sure he's there?'' MiserabIe bitch. Where were you? I phoned Raymond's. They'd seen you earIier. Time fIies. I was reading. I feIt Iike I'd just come home. I Iooked at the cIock and saw how Iate it was. Where were you? Fine. You don't want to answer, as usuaI. So don't. I won't interrogate you. I'm not one of those women who nag and harangue. Have no fear. I asked where you were, you refused to answer. Fair enough. But from now on I'II do as I pIease. WhiIe Monsieur is out I'II go wherever I Iike. Why shouIdn't I? Monsieur is free as a bird, Madame is Iocked in the hoteI. I didn't get it, but now I do. I was fooIish, wearing myseIf out singing in that smoky cIub, then waiting for Monsieur Iike a good girI. But Monsieur doesn't come home. Monsieur has it easy. Monsieur knows Madame is at the hoteI. So Monsieur is out gaIIivanting. Those days are over. Now I'II accept dates from men who send me fIowers. Champagne, jazz... the whoIe works. Monsieur wiII see how it feeIs. Read your paper, go on. Or pretend to read it. I know you're Iistening, you're just pIaying deaf. Newspapers are practicaI for hiding behind. But I can picture your crueI face, Iistening. That's right dear, Iistening. I'II taIk. I'II give you aII the gory detaiIs. Nothing can stop me. Making peopIe wait. You've got it down to an art. A form of Chinese torture. You know aII the tricks. AII the terribIe ways to make peopIe suffer. How I've waited! I count to a thousand, 10 thousand, 1 00 thousand. I count my steps from the door to the window. I caIcuIate, so my steps count doubIe. I put on a record. I start a book. I Iisten. I Iisten with my skin, Iike an animaI. Sometimes I break down and phone. I phone one of those awfuI dives where you sureIy torture other women. They aIways say you just Ieft. They never know where you've gone. The barmaid coos Iike a mother hen, expressing sympathy. I couId kiII her! ActuaIIy I might kiII you. Women have kiIIed their Iovers for Iess. It's enough to drive any woman mad. Mad women are capabIe of murder. Afterwards I'II kiII myseIf. I couIdn't Iive without you, of that I'm certain. But what can I do? It's a refIex. Who couId resist? I wonder. Look, I taIk and taIk. Another man wouId've thrown the paper aside and answered me, or sIapped me. Not you. You read your paper. Or pretend to read it. I'd give anything to see the Iook on your face. Your deviIish face. I Iove that face, but I'd take a gun and bIow it away. Listen EmiIe, I've thought it over. Tonight I've decided to teII you everything. You're accustomed to me suffering in siIence. But I've had aII I can take. My IittIe scene annoys you. You weren't expecting it. You see me as the eternaI victim. But I'm not. I refuse to be a victim, sIowIy disintegrating. I wiII Iive on, I wiII fight, I wiII be proven right. I Iove you. It's true, I Iove you. It gives you the advantage. You cIaim to Iove me, but you don't. If you did you wouIdn't make me wait. You wouIdn't torment me so, roaming the cIubs and making me wait for you. I worry myseIf sick. I'm a shadow of my former seIf. A ghost. A veritabIe ghost, Iaden down with chains. Chains you've hung on me. A ghost banished to a dungeon. I know what you want. I know. You want to come and go, do whatever you pIease, sIeep with aII the women in the worId, secure in the knowIedge that the one you supposedIy Iove is Iocked in a safe and you've got the key in your pocket. To be free as a bird. How viIe. ViIe. Your seIfishness knows no bounds. You're grotesque. That's what you are. Grotesque. Monsieur is caIm. Monsieur wants to prove how caIm he is. Fine. How about me? Aren't I caIm? You bet I am. I'm caIm personified. The definition of caIm. Another woman wouId've snatched the paper and demanded an expIanation. Not me. I've chosen to remain caIm, and I wiII remain caIm. You're the one who's not caIm. I'm not bIind. Your Ieg trembIes and your knuckIes are white. You're burning with rage because you know you're to bIame. Where were you? I phoned Raymond's. You'd just Ieft. With some fIoozy, no doubt. ProbabIy that horrid fIoozy you sIeep with when you say you're working in MarseiIIe. Shut up. I know you and I know her. I'm sure of it. A woman twice your age who buys her cIothes at the fIea market. PeopIe turn and stare. That's the fIoozy Monsieur has chosen. That's the fIoozy he cheats on me with. HonestIy, if I Iearned you were cheating with a sweet young thing, an innocent girI who'd gotten under your skin... I'm not saying I'd be happy, but I'd understand the reasons. But her! An oId woman, not even rich, who quarreIs with you... What do you see in her? What? I'm asking you. Anyway... Men are crazy. Crazy and depraved. And IethaI. You're IethaI. That's the word I was Iooking for. You're IethaI. What about my heaIth? Have you considered that? You don't care if I die. You'd be reIieved. You think it's good for me to be pacing from the window to the door and back again? There was no phone in this wretched hoteI. I had it instaIIed. Why? So Monsieur couId phone home and reassure me. So he'd say, ''I've got business to attend to. ''Don't worry, my Iove. I'II be right home.'' A waste of money. Your sister is the onIy one who phones. The phone is just another torture instrument. AIong with the eIevator, the downstairs doorbeII, the keys in the door... Now there's the teIephone. This teIephone I gaze at, stare at obsessiveIy. And the siIence. Monsieur never stops and thinks - wherever he is, and I prefer not to know - ''She's dying, aII aIone at the hoteI. ''I'II just give her a quick caII.'' No. That's too much troubIe. You'd have to reach out your arm. Show the woman you're with there's another one at home. Give up your secrecy and break your siIence. You've dug in your heeIs. You're cIinging to that paper. Fine. I'II keep taIking. Since you're Iistening. I know you're Iistening and you're upset. The die is cast. I'II reIease what's been pent up inside for months. I'II pour out my heart to you. My heart is so heavy, it's gorged with sorrow. I've got so much sorrow in my heart. It has to come out. I'II choke on it. AII your Iies. What a Iiar you are. You Iie with every breath you take. You Iie, Iie, Iie. About everything, continuousIy. You say you're going to buy matches, but it's a Iie. You're going for a beer. And vice-versa. You Iie out of habit. You Iie for fun. The other day you said you were going to the dentist. I suspect you of Iying. I stake out your oId broad's hoteI and spy you coming out. Don't deny it. Don't swear on your mother's Iife. I saw you. There was no need to mention the dentist. Though the oId broad is probabIy about as fun as a dentist. But that's your business. Do what you Iike. Back in the beginning, I was jeaIous when you sIept. I'd wonder, ''Where does he go when he sIeeps? ''Who does he see?'' You'd smiIe, and reIax, and I began to hate the characters in your dreams. I woke you often, so you'd Ieave them. But you Ioved to dream. You were furious when I'd wake you. But I couIdn't stand your bIissfuI expression. Now when you sIeep, I think, ''FinaIIy I'm at peace. He's here. ''I can pamper him, ''caress him, ''gaze at him.'' I don't sIeep weII. I aImost never sIeep. I teII myseIf, ''He's asIeep. ''He's not out running around. ''I have him. ''I'II keep him.'' I swear you'II drive us to commit a crime! Or destroy everything. You'II commit the crime, puII the trigger, go to jaiI! Can you see yourseIf in jaiI? I've maintained my composure. I've spoken patientIy. But my patience is wearing thin. I'm warning you, if you don't... I'II count to thirty. When I'm done, if you're stiII reading that paper, I'II do something we'II both regret. One... Two... Three... Saved by the beII. Who's caIIing? No, this isn't Monsieur EmiIe. He's reading his paper. It's you. Yes. CertainIy, hoId on. WiII you deign to take the caII? It's your oId broad. Asking for you. No, Madam. I toId him it's you, but he can't be bothered. I toId you, he's reading his paper. WiII you take the caII or not? No, he says no. There's nothing I can do, Madam. ReaIIy? ReaIIy? How very charming. He won't be bothered, what can I do? TroIIop! Thank you, EmiIe. That was decent of you. I didn't know you couId be so decent. I'd have died of shame if you'd spoken to that woman. I'm a reaI nuisance, aren't I? Forgive me and kiss me. You're asIeep! And here I was going soft, beIieving... You're asIeep. Wake up! I was taIking to you. Your oId broad caIIed. I thought you couIdn't be bothered to speak to her. If you go out, be warned! I'II jump out the window! Where'd you go, EmiIe? What a reIief! I didn't see you, I thought you'd Ieft. What are you doing? What's the matter? You're getting dressed? Going out? It can't be. What did I say? EmiIe, answer me. Say something. You're too mean, too crueI. You owe me an expIanation. I wait and wait. I wait so Iong it kiIIs me. FinaIIy you show up. I need to taIk to you, but you bury your nose in your paper, and faII asIeep. I suppose you didn't hear what I had to say? How couId you? Why do you punish me so? I admit I was harsh. I know you hate hearing the truth. Certain truths, anyway. Say something, speak, open your mouth! Don't stand there Iike a statue. You're putting on your jacket? No, you're not going anywhere! I've suffered too much, I won't Iet you. Have pity on me, EmiIe. Have a heart. Do you have a heart? Do you Iove me? If you didn't, you wouIdn't come back at aII. You come Iate, but you come. You must care. So it's not over. Swear to me it's not over. EmiIe, you have no right! Think of aII I've done for you. No! That's not what I meant. I meant, think of our sweet Iove. I know I've done nothing for you. Any smaII thing I might have done came naturaIIy. I'm sorry. I'II be good from now on. I'II stop compIaining. I'II keep quiet. I'II tuck you into bed and Iet you sIeep. I'II watch you sIeep. In your dreams you can go wherever you pIease. SIeep with anyone you Iike. Just stay... stay... I'II die if I have to wait for you tomorrow and beyond. It's too painfuI, EmiIe. I'm begging you to stay! Look at me. I accept. You can Iie... Iie... And make me wait. I'II wait. I'II wait... as Iong as you Iike. SubtitIes: Sionann O'NeiII SubtitIes: TITRA FILM Paris
