REVOLUTION - Police, go back! - Long live the revolution! - Long live the revolution! - Long live the revolution! - Long live the revolution! - Long live the revolution! - Police, go back! - Police, go back! Police, go back! I am warning all of you! It will be good that... - Police, go back! - Police, go back! - Long live the revolution! - Long live the revolution! - Long live the revolution! - Long live the revolution! - Police, go back! - Police, go back! Come on, shoot me! Long live the revolution! - Why did you go there? - It was not intentional. Sorry, sir. It was an act of self-defense. Come on. It's 2:00 a.m. Let's go. Do one thing. Turn the vehicle. We'll go there. - Will Suresh's tea shop be open now? - No. The shop opens at 4:00 p.m. Suhail, aren't you a bit early today? I'll be able to deliver newspaper only if I start now. - Hello, sir! - Yes! - Shall we move, sir? - Hello. Where are you? Have you reached? Start the vehicle. - Okay, sir. - Let's go. We have got an information of a robbery which happened in a jewellery shop near Gandhi square, Kattappana. Bravo team has already set off to the scene. The dog squad, the team of finger print experts and scientific experts are needed here. Over. Sir, he is the owner of the jewellery store. He is the one who saw it first, - Haven't you taken his statement? - Yes, sir. Where is the dog squad and the forensics team? We have informed them. They must be on the way. - Check over there. - Okay, sir. Don't touch anything before the forensic team arrives! Sorry. Sir, the main items are in the locker. - Where is it? - It's right there. Where is the CCTV-DVR? It's out of order since some time now. Mr. Siddique, can you call in your team? Okay. Follow him. - Do not touch it! Let them examine. - Okay, sir. Get me a flashlight. - Siddique. - Sir. Have a look. Don't worry. Let them finish their job. Let's see what we can do. Okay. Hold it. - Have you taken the prints of the workers? - I am on it, sir. - What about the blood sample? - Already sent, sir. - Who was on night duty yesterday? - It was me, sir. All thanks to the Lord. They could not open the main locker. Around 15 kilogram of gold was in there. How much did you lose? We lost around 2.67 kilogram of gold and three kilogram of silver. Don't overstate it. Tell me the actual weight. As per records, it's 1.870 kilogram of gold. So that explains why your CCTVs are not functioning. - Sir, the prints are pretty clear. - That's good. - Do we have some prints? - Yes, sir. - Are they clear? - Yes. - What was the loss? - We are assessing it, sir. - Camera? - Cameras are not working for some days. - You're the store owner, right? - Yes, sir. You're also the district secretary - of the association, right? - Yes, sir. It's a shame that you don't even have a functional camera. - Where is the locker? Let's go. - It's inside, sir. Get me the list of criminals with similar modus operandi in the district. I will send the report listing. - Okay? - Yes, sir. I hope you have checked it thoroughly. I shall inform the SP. Sajan, I heard that you are going through depression. If one of us gets into trouble, we take care of them. That's how it works. Don't forget as to how we dealt with your case. Let's go. Sir! Yes, sir. We are here near Thankamani. Yes, we are here for the Nedumkandam case. Sure, sir. We will be there in no time. You may please inform the superintendent. Look, Bijoy… It's true that he harassed you badly but the punishment for killing him is inevitable. You are young. If you cooperate with us, then maybe we can help you. Or else, you know the consequences. Go easy on him in the paperwork. Or else he would not survive in jail. Actually… A lot of things happen in life. What can we do? Do you have any suspects in mind? No one in particular. But one of our employees was terminated recently. Could he be a… - Who is that? - His name is Aravindan. - Where does he live? - He lives in Pathaam Mile. - Who is this? - He is my son, sir. - What does he do? - He has completed MBA. - Didn't see you... - I was in the night shift. Hi, Bashir. You do one thing - Jyothish! - Sir! Take him to the station and get a detailed statement. - Go. - Okay, sir. Come with me. - Is that the owner? - Yes. - Sir, that's Rajesh, Rajeev and Abin. - Sir. Bashir, there was blood stains on the main door. - Please inform the local hospitals. - Sir. Then… Come with me. Their CCTVs were down when the incident took place. Do you think… I thought the same but it's a reputed jewellery group. It seems unlikely to fake a theft for the insurance money. But we should think from that point of view as well. You should stay here. I am heading to the station. Sir. - Hey. - Hi, sir. - What's your name? - Rahul. How many siblings do you have? Actually I have a sister, Raj it ha. She is married and settled in the US. Alright. So you are the only heir. But you don't seem to be worried. Sir, actually I am worried. Excuse... Sorry, sir. What do you have to say? This is done by him. - Who? - Aravindan. - Who is that? - He was our manager. Why are you so sure about it? Until recently, I was not even allowed to set foot in the store. He was Dad's confidant. Dad started listening to me only after he was cheated by this guy. He took almost 160 grams of gold. Later it was me who settled the case by attaching his property. He knows the store more than my Dad. - I am sure he is the one. - So, you have confirmation on it? We don't need to investigate, right? You may go now. You should come here whenever we call you. Got it? - Yes, sir. - Go. Freeze there. Zoom it. - Make a copy of it. - Sure, sir. - Was it them, sister? - Yes, sir. Satyanath is 55 years old and Satheesh is 26. They are from Mat ha city. They came here with a hand injury by 4:10 a.m. The elder one lost a lot of blood. He needed suture with seven to eight stitches. He was diabetic. So the doctor had asked them to stay until morning. But they insisted for discharge. Get her phone number. Sister, please give your phone number. 9-9-6-1-7-3-8-6-1-7. - What's your name? - Dhanya. - We will call in case of a doubt. - Yes, sir. - I'll definitely do it, sir. - Ma'am, please sign here. Yes, sir. Thank you. Ma'am, trace of blood was found at the place of occurrence. We have collected the sample. The jewellery owner's son has given a name as suspect. He is Mr. Aravindan. He was an ex-employee who was fired. Find him! Also identify criminals with the same modus operandi. Check the whereabouts of all thieves who have bailed out recently. You should also check if they are currently active or not. There was a jewellery theft in Kunnukara last year, with the same MO. - Okay. - But they are all fresh offenders. They were local thieves and no recovery was made as evidence. This case won't hold in the court. We are collecting all the CCTV footages from that area. - We can take all possible actions. - Okay. Is it possible to check all those vehicles on road? The thieves will be long gone by then. I am sure this case will go undetected. I don't think there will be many vehicles on the road at that hour. The owner if that jewellery shop is the secretary of their association. I am already getting calls from Trivandrum. Do something fast. Carry on now, and let me know if you need any help. - Alright? - Yes, ma'am. This is Mat ha city she referred to. Pull over here. And this is Manian's shop. - Hey, Manian. - Sir. Have a look. That's Satyanath and Satheesh. Do you know them? Both of them live near the temple. Take a left turn from there. It's on the left-hand side. The house is painted green. The father and son live there. The father is addicted to alcohol. It seems like a usual brawl between them. - The son is my friend. - Alright. Let's go. Hello. Yes. Okay. Sir, we found nothing from the lead we got from the hospital. It was just a casual brawl between the father and the son. Rajesh's information is always credible. Even though he looks fraud, Varghese's son has a point. Aravindan! What's his story? His house has been locked and his phone is switched off. I have asked to check his antecedents. Oh, no! - Sir. - Hello. Can you hear me? - Sir. - You need to go to Pathaam mile. Okay, sir. That's where Aravindan lives. Leave right now. - Okay, sir. - Don't knock the door straight away. Just get me the information. - Sir. - Alright then. Pathaam mile… Where will Pathaam Mile be? Do you know him? Yes, he is Aravindan. He is the son of our late teacher. I haven't seen him here for some time. I am not into that now, sir. - Who are his friends here? - Who is this new guy, sir? Answer me! Who are his friends? - Do you remember Mathew? - Who is that? The stout guy! - The stout guy… - He is friends with Mathew. - Is he from Puliyanmala? - Yes, he is friends with him. Got it. Where can we meet him? He will be there in the cardamom estate at Vandanmedu. - You seem to be well connected! - Of course. As a local guy, I had been in the shadow squad. - That's how Basheer picked me. - Really? This is a different world. Organized network, thieves, pimps, prostitutes, goons. They are no different from us either. - You are always on phone. - Will introduce you to everyone? What's wrong in looking at my own phone? He dared to question me. I gave him one tight slap! He then jumped and came to me. And then I asked him about the issue. He again ran from there. I went in and looked. Then, what? That's okay. We'll do something. Is the only snack you have? - Come on, run! - Run! Run! Sir, why are you here? You have got good friends. We were just having some drinks, sir. Are you friends with this guy? Aravindan! He is not a friend, but he works here in the plantation. - Where is he now? - He must be at home. Why would we come here if he were? He might've gone to his aunt's place in Kallara. I don't know anything, sir. - You mean, Kallara in Kottayam? - Yes, sir. I swear I am not connected to him. I will call you back. It's the sub inspector of Kallara. Rajesh's informer was right. - Aravindan is there in Kottayam. - Shall we bring him in? As per their information, he is heading here. We shall track his phone. Varghese and his son seem to be sure about him. I do not think this would end with Aravindan. Why did you stop drinking? It's been a while. My kids are grown up as well. It seems you are used to it. Okay. See you tomorrow. Didn't you buy anything? Why have you come empty handed? Sorry, I forgot. Why don't you come in and have a tea? No, thanks. I have a program to attend. - Okay. - Did you watch my Tik Tok video? Yeah. That was hilarious! - I still have a lot to do. - Oh! Hello, what's up? - Hello. - Sir. - He's reached Upputhara. - What? Aravindan is now at Upputhara tower. - He may take another 15 minutes. - Really? - Can I speak to Mr. Sajan? - Sir, it's Rajeev. -Tell me, Rajeev -Sir, Rahul seems a bit off to me. He seems to have made a call around the time of occurrence. It was a call that lasted for 23 minutes. And in the morning, during our time of interrogation there was another call made which lasted for 90 minutes. What about the location of that number? It was at Vannappuram tower. The connection is in the name of Aswathy. Will have to verify the address. Any text messages between them? That number does not have any messaging application, sir. There is only a text message saying "Call me back" in the past two days. Get me the frequent contact list of that number. Not even a single call was made to the other numbers. - Really? - Yes, sir. What about Aravindan's status? He is still moving, sir. You can use the front door as well. Aravindan! Where are you coming from, Aravindan? It's you, right? - Sir. - Come with us. I knew that you would come. Who informed you? Sir, I got a call from the jewellery shop. Why should I drag him into trouble? I'd been working there since I was 18. I ran that store single-handedly for ten years. Not even a speck of gold went missing during the entire period. - Then, why did you steal from there? - I did not steal! - You bastard! - Rajesh, what's this? - Don't you raise your voice at him! - Rajesh, you step aside. Leave it. Aravindan, you tell me. Sir, I don't have the need to steal. I was happy with my salary. I fell in love with a girl. Had to give 20 sovereigns for her sister's wedding. They had promised to return the money as soon as the bank loan was approved. I was about to settle everything but they could not return it. I became the culprit when shortage in the stock was found. I pleaded them to give me some time. But they had no mercy. My Mom had ten cents of land in the town. They forcefully took it from me. Nobody spoke for me. Sir, I work here in the plantation. The people here will vouch for me. I am telling the truth, sir. It's not him, sir. We need not even check his alibi. This is Suhail's vehicle. - Did you call the forensics? - Mr. Rajeev did! - Any luck? - We have identified those vehicles. We know who the owners are. - Then, bring them in. - Okay, sir. - Rajeev. - Sir. - What about the forensics? - They will call back, sir. The festival season is round the corner along with the party meetings. - Yes, sir. - Be alert. - We should try to avoid problems. - Yes, sir. Sensational issues should be dealt cautiously. I am already done with explanations. A lot happens at the Mattappally festival. Last year 12 people were stabbed there. We had to take the blame. The festival is on Sunday, right? Mobilize the station for three to four days. - Okay, sir. - Alright. Bashir, you are lucky to not be working today. Or else you would be troubled a lot. I have gone through the same phase as well. My kids and wife felt that to be a better life. Sir, I just spoke to the forensic and finger print experts. Nothing was found in the forensic report but the fingerprints are all fresh. If they are fresh offenders… Then we need to probe the personal enmity angle in this case. Keeping in mind the current scenario, migrant laborers can't be ruled out. Check from that point of view as well. Has anybody been missing? Have you noticed any strangers lately? No, sir. We haven't come across any such people. - Are you sure? - Yes, I am. Alright. Alright, then. Did you find any leads? No. Let the agent get here. MY CARD, MY IDENTITY We have the copies of all the identity cards. Nobody can leave from here without our knowledge. We have been very careful keeping all the issues in mind. Only four people have left during this period. Two of them are from Bengal. They go home for two weeks during Holi or Dussehra. The other two are from Jharkhand. They were granted leave after all the pleading as their mother was dead. They were good masons. This is the only suspicious vehicle. I haven't seen this van earlier. That car belongs to Dr. Vanaja of the district hospital. The rest are all local vehicles. Did you check it? I'd seen one at Kundanpara the other day, but I am not sure if it's the same van. - It was too dark... - So, you are not sure? I am not certain about it, sir. I am not sure as there were no street lights that night. - Did you notice the number? - No, I didn't. - Try to... - Can't we see the number plate? I can't better the resolution, sir. I think it's KL 38, but it's not that clear. Let's do one thing. Let's send for Shafeeq. He knows all the vehicles here. That's a good idea, sir. Make sure you inform us if you remember something else. - You may go now. - Okay, sir. - Are you still running that tabloid? - Yes, sir. What's the matter? The inspector asked me to come. Come with me. Who is Aswathy from Vannappuram? I don't know, sir. Sir, Rahul doesn't know Aswathy. We should let him go. Let him go. Maybe it's just Aswathy who is responsible. Have her picked up. Seize his phone. That's our only evidence. - Give me your phone. - Sir… Just give it to me. But who will be the one calling from his phone to her's every mid night? Sir, what's the problem? Nothing. You may go, Rahul. Sir, Aswathy knows nothing about this. That means Aswathy does exist. We are in love. She is the daughter of Madhavan Nair, the owner of Aswathy Jewellery. Why does she call only to your number? I bought her this phone so that she could call me. We can't call on her other number. This seems to be a different case. Call that girl and verify this. We can nab him if this isn't true. Give his phone back. You may go now. Okay, sir. What about the taxi driver you mentioned? He is in Devikulam. He will come tomorrow. Hello. I am putting you on speaker. - Sir, it's me, Rajesh. - Tell me, Rajesh. Ma no ha ran and Stalin are the main labor suppliers here. They have the identity proofs of the laborers. We have personally verified those. Sir, the four laborers who left the area on that night are still missing. Their are not reachable over phone. It's possible that they are at a deserted place. Rajeev will be checking the call data records. Okay! Meet you in the office at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow. - Good night. - Good night, sir. So, we are free for now. Let's go somewhere and have a drink or two. You go and have. I will go to the club and play a round or two. Don't do this to me! Who will drop me home then? You have many friends for that. This is our vehicle. This one is KL 37, 1217. This too is local. This is Planter Kunjachan's Jeep. But this van… Sir, show me this one. Stop there. That van is not a local one. I've seen it once or twice in the market. We have six vans here. I know all of those, but this one… This one… I have seen it. They must be using the van for marketing purposes. I have seen it once or twice in the market. Shafeeq, you hit up the market and let's find out more on this. - Alright then. - Okay. I will take your leave. Bashir, send the photo of this van to Abin and Rajesh. - Ask them to get the details the RTO. - Okay, sir. - Swathi works at the RTO. I'll call him. - Okay. Come to the station tomorrow morning. SI will be here. Yes, ma'am. No! I will update you, ma'am. Thank you. - Rajesh, I am sending you a photo. - Hello. Please check it and call me. It's urgent. - It's urgent. - Have you sent the photo? - I will wait for your call. - Let me see it. I am driving now. Let me have a look. - Nothing, that's not an issue. - It's of a lorry then… I will check once I pull over. - Got it? - You got it? Did you get your thing? Sir. Got the numbers of those migrant workers? Yes. - Did you check the call data record? - On it, sir. Their tower location is at Eranakulam North railway station by 12 midnight. From there it shows as Erode, Salem, Guntur… Anyhow they've left the town way before the incident. So, it's not them either. VIMALA TOURIST HOME - Have you seen this vehicle? - No, sir. - Are you sure? - Yes. Sir, buy a lottery ticket. You could be lucky. - No, I don't want. - Please, sir. No one can predict the luck. Buy one. Take the other one. - Where can we find Sreeraj? - He must be sleeping down there. Come. Sreeraj. - Hello. - Sreeraj. Get up! - Sir, you could have called me. - So that you could just slip Have you seen this vehicle? Yes… this belongs to those Hindi guys. I mistook it for Mookkan's vehicle the other day. But it was those guys. What's the problem, sir? Does Mookkan have this kind of van? Yes, he has many vehicles. Who is Mookkan? He gives loans and murders people for the sake of money. Sir, we got him! It's Mookkan! Mookkan Balan. He's a regular. - Shall we nab him? - No. Rajeev, I want the location. Confirm if it's the same vehicle. We need to get Sumit, the rickshaw driver to confirm it. - Why him? - He is Mookkan's right-hand man. Pull over here. There he is. - Sir, let's move the vehicle from here. - Wait, let them go in. - Hi, sir. - Start the vehicle. - Sujith is our man. - Really? This is Abin. What is this about, sir? Don't I cooperate with you? - Where is your boss, Mookkan? - He must be home, sir. Why does he have a van? Actually it belongs to Joanappan. He is yet to pay a debt to Mookkan. Mookkan took the van as an insurance for the money. I don't think anything seems to be wrong. It's leased out to some North Indian guys selling ready-made garments. It's a decent family, sir. Where is his house? It's near Edassery. Let's go there. He will kill me if I go with you. I will kill you if you don't. Go! He is a tough guy. Let's go. He sounds loyal. Okay, Rajesh. Mookkan owns the vehicle. It's confirmed. Hello, Rajeev, Mookkan's location is correct, right? Alright. Come. Shall I go, sir? Give me the keys and be right here. - Who are you? - Is Balan in? - No. - I was told that he is here. - He is not here. - Where did he go? Didn't I tell you that he is not here? We are not here to nab him. Just need to ask him some questions. That's all. How dare you trespass into a house where only women live? Hey, we are police. We need to see him. How can I be sure of that? Behave! - What? - Call him, now. How can I call somebody who is not here? Do what I say! Oh, God! - Please look at this. - Hey... These guys are creating ruckus here! - Please come here! - Listen to me! - Come and help me! - Hey! Get out from my house! Just go! - Get lost, you dogs! - What? - Oh, God! - Hey! - Step aside! - Go! Get lost. I'll show you! Do you want to see? - Come on! I dare you film me! - Listen to me! We have done nothing! Don't blame us. - Do you want to see? - Stop it! Mr. Bashir. What happened, sir? What happened, sir? What have you done? Don't you know them? How could you make me act like a fool? Useless fellow! Come, let's go. How did you meet those Hindi guys? Which guys are you talking about? How many Hindi guys do you know? Those guys who took the van for lease. I know them. Where is that van now? It's there, in front of my house. They left after a couple of days. They said that somebody has died in their family. Why did you change the plate number? I did not do that. It was them who did it. They thought it was bad luck. They might not have known that it's illegal. Where do they live? They live near Manjapra. They live in a rented house owned by one Mr. Paily. He runs the ration shop there. Bashir, get the forensic team and fingerprint team to check that van. - Take it in custody only after that. - Sir. - What's the case, sir? - Where is Paily's house? Do you know the seventeenth mile? We need to move upwards from that road. What did you get in return? Cash or gold? I didn't get anything. I took a hefty rent from them for the van. Did not imagine that they would dupe me. You may keep me in custody. I can't go back home. It's all messed up. Take a left after that curve. - Where? - There is a yellow painted building. There it is. Paily's house it adjacent to it. That second house. Yes, the white one. That's Paily's house. Bashir, you go first. What's the issue, sir? Paily. I am unwell. I have blood pressure issues. Nothing to worry. We have some questions for you. Come. Where are your tenants? They've gone home, after a death in their family. Has anything happened to them? They are good people. How do you know them? Mookkan brought them here. They were a family. They were very prompt in paying the rent. And they maintained the house well. - Do you have a deed? - Yes. - Copies of identity card? - Yes. Take those papers and the keys as well. Okay, sir. Sir, don't frighten him. He will die of a heart attack. Sir, these are the papers. Check it. Sir, I am no troublemaker. Haven't ever been to a police station. Don't worry, Paily. Just tell us what you know. - They are brothers. - Ma'am. The elder one is about 50 years of age. His daughter was also with them. She was around 25. She was well behaved and very friendly with my family. If somebody comes, she would go inside cover her head with the saree. They had two relatives as well. They would not talk much. What's the matter, sir? Yes, there is a breakthrough, ma'am. We have 90 percent confirmation on it. Okay. Keep this. Ma'am, it's a five member gang. As per the information, they are in Dhanaganj area of Dholpur district of Raj as than which is near the Uttar Pradesh border. They were living in a rented house in Manjapra for the past four months. - The house is owned by one Mr. Paily. - Okay. Names and their identity cards are all fake. Everybody knows them as garment sellers traveling in a van. There was a woman in their team, who had been the homemaker. The house owner says she is the daughter of one of the elderly person. But how can you be sure about the location? Ma'am, even though their documents were fake… They had used a phone number to get gas and TV connection. The number was switched on immediately after the robbery. After that it is switched off. They have used this number rarely here in Kerala. - Okay. - Three numbers which were in contact with this one are now static under a tower in Dhanaganj. Which means… They live in the same house or neighboring ones. Okay. The number we identified is switched off now, but the contacts are active. We have pulled the Google pin for those. We can't have a conclusion only because the number was active during the time of occurrence. We'd conducted a search in the house - where they were living. - Okay. We have recovered partial evidence with the seal of the jewellery from there. That's actually good. So, you are confident? - Yes, ma'am. - What's your next step then? We need to go there, ma'am. The rest of the job is there only. - Okay. - Is this even realistic? This is an interstate pursuit. We struggle to catch the local thieves. Suppose we catch them. Can we recover the evidence? It's impossible! This is nothing but a waste of money. Let's try, sir. - Sajan, do one thing. - Ma'am. You process the application for presidency passports. - Yeah. - What's your team like? I need Bashir with me. Then… We need two more men. No way, Sajan. It's not happening. This is nothing but futile… We hardly have enough men here, to maintain law and order. Sajan, you manage with the existing team. I shall call the SP Dholpur. - Okay? - Yes, ma'am. All the best. - Are you out of your senses? - Useless! The festival time is round the corner. We will need to work extra hours and you guys set off for North Indian tour. Is it worth the effort? This is just a theft, not some murder case. It's a mere show off! - Sir, let us just... - Go. We will see whom could you nab from there. - What a man! - Leave it, he is just like that. Hello, ma'am. Sajan, I've spoken to the SP there. He has offered us all the help. But he says, the village is slightly prone to violence. A couple of officers had died in a raid there some time ago. - So, I think you have to be very careful. - Yes, ma'am. Sure. Where are you boarding your train from? Eranakulam or Kottayam? Ernakulam, ma'am. Call me if you need something. - Wish you all the very best, Sajan. - Thank you, ma'am. Sir, let's have a tea. Sir, let's have a tea. No. - Do you have tea? - Do they have it? - Less sugar for me. - What about you, Rajeev? -I just want a tea -Abin. - Give me four cups of tea. - Okay. What? Stop there. - Hey… - Rajesh. Hey! Hey! What happened? He ran away! The area seems troublesome, sir. Blow horn again. - Who are you? - Sajan Philip, Circle Inspector. - Whom do you want to meet? - We need to meet the SP. - He is not here. - Could you open the gate? Sure, sir. Haven't you taken the letter? SP? He is not here. We are Kerala Police. Can we meet the SP please? Look, he is not here. You can wait over there - Brother, where is the wash room? - What? - Bathroom. - Follow me. Rajesh, do you have an extra cigarette? - Yes, sir. - Get me one. Have a look. - Jai hind, sir. - Who are the guests? They are from Kerala Police. They want to meet SP. Welcome, sir. Myself Inspector Dinesh Pradhan. - CI, Sajan Philip. - Nice meeting you. - Get them some tea or something. - Yes, sir. We just reached here. We are waiting for the SP. No, it's not cold out here. Looks like he's come. Okay, I will call. Hi! - Sir, CI Saj... - Sorry, I am late. Come. Dhanaganj! It's a very crime prone area, and… Every second person in the village is a criminal because of the strange nature of this village. Politicians appear and vanish making huge promises. Nothing has been done for development. So everybody is indulged into crime. Some years ago, we had gone there for an operation which resulted in police firing. We lost a policeman and a villager. There was huge chaos in the assembly. The opposition demanded action against the police and everyone else. It's very difficult to go there and conduct an operation. But I have received the call, will give you full support. - I will help you with everything. - Thank you. - But you have to be very careful. - Yes, sir. - You have to be very careful. - Yes, sir. So, I can assure you that everything will be given to you. Pradhan… - Jai hind. - Jai hind. What's going on? Everything is fine, sir. - Did you offer him something to drink? - Of course, sir. - Did you offer him snacks? - Yes, I did, sir! - Did you have tea? - Yes, sir. Good. Make arrangements for their stay. Take them either to Hotel Ganga or somewhere better. It's your duty to make arrangements. - And make sure it is the best! - Okay. Thank you, sir. Okay! Nice meeting you. And you can come to me anytime you feel like. Thank you so much, sir. Stop here. - Is the room ready? - Good evening, sir. You must have got a call from the SP office. - Yes, sir. - Get the keys. - They are the Kerala Police. - Okay. - They should have a peaceful stay. - Sure. - Got it? - Don't worry, sir. Yes, sir! - Okay, sir. - Good night. Take rest. - Thank you. - Meet you in the morning. Good night. - Okay, sir. - Okay. - Good night, sir. - Okay. - Where is Rajesh? - He has gone to buy something. Oh, no! It's so cold out here. I was about to ask you. You didn't ask me until now. Sit down. Where did you get this? Rickshaw drivers are the same everywhere. Pour one for me as well. Have this, sir. Cheers. Good morning. File an absent report citing the investigation. Yes, I will inform the SP. Alright. You are ready. How did you bath in this stinky toilet? We policemen have to manage with any kind of situation. That's okay. I have booked rooms in the hotel opposite to this one. - It's small but tidy. - Shall we vacate right away? No! They have booked it for us. Let's not vacate. - Ask them to get ready. - Sure. - Hold this for a moment. - Why? Let me take his bag. Sir, I will take the bag. I will bring it. Go and order some breakfast. Okay, sir. - Didn't you sleep well yesterday? - Yes, I did. SP's vehicle is not here. - Hello, sir. - Good morning. - Inspector? - He is inside. Please wait for sometime. Didn't I tell you? The checking was strict there. You drove straight into it. These guys seems a bit off. Are we being ignored? You are here! We are done with your work. You may go to Dhanaganj Police Station. Ashok Pankaj is the station house officer. Meet him, and it will be all done. Dhanaganj Police Station? Use Google maps. It's simple nowadays. It's 35 kilometers from here. You will reach there by afternoon. - Off you go. - Thank you, sir. Okay, take care. What was it's name, again? - I have an upset stomach? - What happened? Maybe it's because of the kachori. Yes, that's what I meant. We will have to settle for local food while on tour. We can't look for beef or pork everywhere. Sir, better you don't talk about beef here. We may take some food and an induction cooker next time so that we can have our own food. Right, sir? No wonder the Deputy Superintendent says we are on vacation. Can you find some restaurant where we can have some upma? We can catch the thieves thereafter. - Brother. - What happened? Where is the police station? - Police station? - Yes. Go straight and take a turn. It's on the left-hand side. - Where are you from? - We are journalists from Delhi. You don't seem like you're from Delhi. Let's go. Thank you. Where are you going? What did they say? - Which way to go, Sir? - We may go left and then straight. Watch both sides. We are Kerala Police. Our Circle Inspector is with us. - We want to meet your officer. - Wait a minute. Look, SP Sir has already briefed me about the case. There are 22 villages under this Police Station. The biggest of those is Dhanaganj. The station's name too is Dhanaganj, but… I've not set foot in this village till date. 11 years back… A team from Maharashtra had come. Our local team was also part of the operation. We lost four constables in the shoot out. It created quite a furore in the assembly but nothing happened after that. After that we have literally no dealings with that village. Neither they trouble us nor do we. That's how it goes now. Have tea. Our officer will be here soon. He is a local guy. You may talk to him. Here comes the tea. Have it. I will be back soon, after finishing some work. Do you have the photo of the thieves? - Yes, sir. - Show it to me. Alright… I will tell Manoj. Okay. Somebody else will come. Sir, can you come here for a minute. Sir, please don't mind but you must be aware that you need to take good care of Manoj to speeden the process. What? Gift. Give him some gift. DHANAGANJ POLICE STATION What's it, sir? Maybe you too like it. We need to give some gift to that Manoj. What a recommendation from a Senior officer! - Come on, have tea. - I don't want. It's buffalo milk. - You don't want? - No. - Where is Rajesh? - Must have gone some where. Abin, he's the guy. STATION OFFICER'S ROOM - Are you Manoj? - Yes, sir. We are Kerala Police. This is our Circle Inspector. Jai hind, sir. Manoj, we need your help. How can I help? These people are from Dhanaganj. Do you know them? They are not known to me, but… I guess they are from Dhanaganj. I know somebody who knows. Will talk to him and get back to you. - Tomorrow? - Yes, sir. What does he say? He doesn't know them. He will ask around and tell us tomorrow. What if he doesn't know them? Was the location correct? The location is spot on, sir. Let's get them in the morning. I've confirmed it by contact. Are you sure? We will meet tomorrow. Sure, sir. - Okay. - Jai hind, sir. Jai hind, sir. Greetings. Sir, what about giving him the gift? You keep this. - No need, sir. - Keep it, bro. - Keep it. - Sir, there was no need of this. Keep it. If you insist, I will take it. You will work with us, right? We need to get them. Why not, sir? We are working together. Don't worry, sir. We will do what should be done. How could they get away? - We are with you. - Thank you. - Nothing to worry. - Okay. Greetings, sir. So, Manoj is all set. Rajesh, look here. Don't forget that I am your senior in the service. You should call me "sir." You know, I'm writing the SI test. Once I clear it, you will have to call me as "sir." I will call it quit, then. Don't do it. It will be huge loss for Kerala Police. What do you think? Bashir, have you been here before? I have been there, sir. Could not even go out on the streets with my name, back then. - Is it any better now? - Not really. What's your plan, post retirement? Have been thinking of it for a while. Kids are still young. I do not have any savings other than the salary. Will have to take up some kind of job. The only relief is that… Unlike many of us I do not have many foes. Who knows how many innocents have we shut away? What if one of them decides to stab you from the dark after your retirement? God knows. Hello, am I speaking to Manoj? I'm Inspector Sajan of the Kerala Police. What? Okay. This is a very backward area. There is nothing but milk. Enmity between communities often causes violence. And because of this, no one cares to help each other. Manoj, this is Yadram. He doesn't stay in the village. - He works for Amit Sharma. - Okay. He might be doing thievery or dacoity. Note their original names. - Rajeev, mark those photos. - Okay, sir. This is Sandhu and he is Sukhram. They are Yadram's relatives as well. Really? This one is Netram. He is into hooch business along with Bhajrangi. - Netram, right? - Yes. Thanks, Sisodia. You have helped us a lot. - Manoj, what's this all about? - This is a police matter. Thanks for your help. Thanks. Greetings. Sir, your work will be over by the day. Netram will be in your custody. Hey Bhajrangi, where are you? We need to meet. It's urgent. When and where? Come fast, I am on the way. Hurry up. Hey, Bhajrangi. How are you, bro? It's your lucky day. Look, lady luck has arrived at your door steps. These people are form Delhi. They want the stuff in plenty. The only person I could think of was you. That's why I brought them here. - Can we trust them? - Of course. Believe me! How much do you want? 200 to 300 liters for this week? It's okay even if it's little less than it. I have to discuss with Netram. Where is this Netram? - Shall I call him? - Do it. - Where are these guys from? - Delhi. Don't forget to give me my share. - Okay? - Hope we won't land in trouble. Don't worry, I am with you. Sir, they are smoking and chilling out there. I have a upset stomach. Could we get some rice and curd? Here he is. - Is he Netram? - Yes. Haven't seen him in this area before. - Where was he hiding? - He was here only. Have you talked to them? What about advance payment? If you pay upfront, then it's a deal. - How much? - Take 20. Give me around 20 to 25,000 rupees. Is 10,000 rupees fine? Give it to them. Hey… they are coming after me. They are police! Stop right there! Run or else they will shoot you! Hey! They will shoot you! Stay there, don't run. Didn't I tell you that I would call? Two of them? Take them. Yadav, get the keys. Yes, sir. Hurry up. What's your name? Netram… Did you rob? Did you rob from Kerala? No, I did not. This guys say that you did. Spit it out, you bloody motherfucker! How many are there in your gang? - I don't know anything. - Talk, you bloody motherfucker! Tell me. Bashir. Speak up, you bastard! Better you talk! Do you want me to tell, you motherfucker? This is not going to work. Rajeev, you go in and ask the things we want. Don't hurt him. Netram, have you been to Kerala? Have you? Tell me. It's better you talk. - Abin. - Sir. Come. Do you know what they are going to do with you? Moron, if they take you to Kerala… They would poke straw into your orifices. What's happening? They are talking in Hindi. I didn't get it. That's why we say you should have studied better in school. My language is enough and more for me. His name is Netram. Son of Nallaram. Native place? Village? Village? - Where do you live? - Dhanaganj. Dhanaganj, right? - Dhanaganj, right? - Dhanaganj. Job? - What do you do for a living? - Tell us. He's into the hooch business. What else? - What's your line of work? - Hooch. Mobile number? - Your mobile number? - Your mobile number. - 7-6-6-5-8-7… - 7-6… - 7-6… - 6-5. 6-5… - 8-7… - 8-7… - 8-5… - 8-5… - 2-2… - 2-2… Okay.

Say it… What's his name? Yadram? - Is he your elder brother? - Is he Yadram? Sir, Yadram is his elder brother. He is the elderly guy, referred by Paily. This is their vocation. The other two, Sandhu and Sukhram too are their relatives. Amit Sharma from Gujarat is their leader. He is the one who takes people from this village to carry out thievery. This is one of his investments. He will manage the cases. This guy says that Yadram has gone to meet Amit Sharma. His wife is the daughter of Bharonidevi, who is the head of the village. Mallika is the woman who was living with them. He says her sister is getting married next day. A part of the gold has already been given to Amit Sharma. - Let's go. - Look, sir. I need to go now. Wife is calling repeatedly. I don't have an option. - Meet you later. - Okay. But what do we do with him? We cannot keep him here. It's too risky. You have to take him with you. He says that we have to take him. Bashir. Ask them to be careful. He might be knowing Malayalam. Abin. Get up. - Sorry, sir. - Come, get some sleep. Come here. - Hope you got me. - What? Don't wander around. Be right here. Sir, I can't do this with out even knowing the language. Let Abin do this. I will come with you. I don't know the language. No, you are not coming. You will guard him. What the hell! As if it's some joke. He will manage it. Good morning, sir. Let's go, we are ready. Sir, wear these identity cards. You guys go inside. I will wait here. Two of my men will accompany you. Okay, sir. Come on. Rajeev… Hey, where are you from? Greetings. We've just been going in circles. We couldn't find anything. Press. Media. I am from a news channel. Sir, something seems off here. I think we should leave now. Bashir, you may go. - Really? - Yes. The three of us are here. Yes, the thief is also with us. Yeah. They are asleep. I shall call you in the morning. Alright. What is it? That was my wife. Rajesh, it's your turn to sleep. I'll sit. Sir, those are the women from that village. Sir, please understand our situation. Yes, it's them. Back. - Did you file a complaint? - Yes, sir. They said it's better to approach the bigger station and there would be quick solution if we came here. Please do something, sir. It's harvest season, sir. If we couldn't work now, we will be in trouble. There will be huge loss, sir. Please help us. We are poor women, sir. Please help us, sir. Don't cry. We will do whatever we can. We were working hard, sir. My husband also works with him, sir. I know you will help us. This is my brother's wife. She is pregnant. - What's your name? - Kamli.

I will talk to SP. One of you needs to be there. Good afternoon, ma'am. Okay. These guys are acting cold. We are yet to get the permission for the raid. It will be great if you can pressurize the SP. Thank you, ma'am. What? Everything is fine. That's Netram's wife and sister. They came to file his missing person report. The village folks have some suspicion. We can't delay the raid anymore. Hey, don't be nervous, sir. These things are like this. We will nab them for sure. Be cool. Bashir, you seem very cool. Come. Sir! Yes, sir. It could be done, sir. Today itself, sir. Hey, sir. Are you tired? We got the permission. We will raid there today itself. Bashir. Come. We got the permission tonight for the raid. Rathod's special team will join us.

Do you need to say this to me? Be alert. Come on. Everybody, assemble here. Come here! Listen to me carefully. We are the first police team to raid this village in 11 years. We should be careful in every step. Got me? Yes, sir They are not scared of us. The plan is to get inside the village. There is only one pathway to the village. We will have to get in and get out through it. Sir, once we are in, we will split into four teams. Two of our guys will be there in each team. One of your men should be there as well. It's our responsibility to protect these men. Got it? But, do not use any lethal weapons. We should catch them unhurt to accomplish the mission. - All clear?

Hey… STATION MASTER'S OFFICE Where the hell were you? Sir, I… Do you even know the gravity of this? How long have you been in the service? Do you think it's just another custody escape? A simple case under 225B? He has escaped! Do you get it? And officially he was not under our custody. If something happens to him, you, me and everybody else will go down. If we lose our job, you and me could get another. Have you ever thought of this man, who protects you every time? He could lose his pension, after all these years of hard work. Just because of you! You should have shown minimum common sense Go, make some tik tok video Or report to your wife about the tour. Why are you making a joke of yourself? Leave it, sir. Don't be upset. Come on. We will catch him again. Get some rest. Sir… Rajesh… Haven't you had food? Leave it. I said it in the heat of the moment. Sir, will there be a problem for the job? I've put a request before SP. Hope it will be alright. Go, have something and sleep for a while. Do you know that I have killed a man? It was not our fault, sir. It is what it is, no matter who is at fault. It was a day like this. As silent as this. All of a sudden additional sub inspector, Johnie pointed towards the jungle. They were coming to us like bees from a hive They had banners, flags and even knives with them. It was a big crowd, of men, women and children. They started pelting stones even before we could understand anything. Johnie was protecting me with his shield. The deputy SP was giving some instructions through the megaphone. But I had gone numb. When Johnie fell, I was caught in front of him. That's when I saw him. He was just a kid, Bashir. He was coming at me with a stone in his hand. I shot him in his chest and not even in his leg. Who has the right to take a life, Bashir? What gave me that audacity? Nothing else, than being a policeman! I thought over and over and reached no where. His death has been vanished even form memories. No evidence. No one is responsible. Our officers saved me. I went on leave for many days. It's killing me form inside… Manoj has come. Everything is set, sir. We could go in now. Let's go, sir. Come on. Hey! You run! Leave him, bro. Please leave him. Leave him! Sir! Come with me! - Netram! - Rajesh! Rajesh… Hey… Sir, it could be dangerous. Come. He got caught! Abin… Catch them. Take them and move to the station, hurry up. Hurry up! Don't stop! Sir, we can't go back. We have to leave now. Sir, Rajesh is coming. Stop there. Let's move. Let's move! Run! Come. Sir! - Let's go! - Run! To heck with all of you! POLICE STATION, DHANAGANJ Come on! Get down. Make them sit there. Go! Sir! Sir! Sir, please check if they are the ones you have been looking for. Try to identify with their photos. You will be taking them with you, right? Let them finish their work. The villagers will set the entire village on fire. They have seized something as well. It's him. He is Sukhram. Sure? Take both of them to our van. Congrats, sir. You finally caught the guys. Mission successful. Thank you. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you, Manoj. Stop them. Sir, it will be dangerous. - Why are you so scared? - Sir. I will take care of everything. Please make him understand. Please try to understand, sir. Alright. Fine. - Hello. - Hello. - Where are you guys? - Who is it? Have you reached the hotel? Tell me. - Hello. Who's this? - Where are you? Answer me! - Abin. - Sir. What's wrong? Hello! - Hello! - Answer the call. - Hello. - Hello! Who is it? I am asking whether you have reached the hotel. - Give me an answer. - What? Sir, it's that woman from the village. - It's them. - Yes. We need to get out of here. We cannot go by the front gate. Everybody is telling us the same. We are searching for the last four days. Where is Netram? Sir, they have only a motor bike. Hello, Balan. Tell me. I am not there, Balan. I've asked SI Biju to come to the court with the draft. You may call him. So, they are out on bail? Okay. It must be the usual gang that got them out. What about that attempted murder case of Kuttikol under section 307? Have they filed the bail application? Okay. Alright. Sir, the guys from Dhanaganj got bail. They will get out today itself. Damn it. That's such a shame! We will never get them again. I agree with you. Advocate Sreedharan Nair from the High Court spoke in their defense. What can the poor magistrate do in a theft case? What are we risking our lives for? That's how things work. Bashir. I could sleep well without even having a drink. Thanks to our trip to Dhanaganj. Hello. Abin, we are almost there. Call them up. You are here. Hello. Sir?
