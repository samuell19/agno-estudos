- Hey, wake up! No sleeping on the job. Now this will start you up, my friend. One could never withstand eight hours of my kind of encouragement. I'm actually tired. You're a full day's work, my friend. Huh? Have you got your voice? Speak up my friend, tell me. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Shit! Fucking asshole! You're hard not to like, my friend. You and I, we're like kindred spirits, you and I. - I doubt that. - Oh, really? No. We are both men of the shadows who fight the secret wars of the world. While 99 percent of the world is oblivious to our existence. We, we determine their fate. - Who do you work for? - The highest bidder. Most of my clients are enemies of the United States. The list just gets longer, I'm pleased to say. This job, it's confusing. Eh? You and I both know that the job is the job. There's no questions, there's no morality. There's just success and failure. I just don't know why you do this. Why would an overpaid assassin risk his life for a bunch of strangers. - They're innocent. - What? - They're innocent. - No! No! No one is innocent! Especially you, my friend. You know, I know you. From Afghanistan. You were assigned to kill a diplomat that I was protecting. Your position was compromised thanks to my skills. You phoned in the Air Force and sent in a drone strike. You... You killed that target that day. - I always do. - Along with his four wives and 30 civilians who had no idea what's happening. Farmers. Herders. Simple people. My people! Last chance, asshole. Tell me where the girls are! Tell me! - I'll see you in hell. You brought this on yourself, asshole. - Forgive me, gentlemen, I just got a ear full from Sec Def. Shit rolls downhill. Jamal, put me in a good mood. Did you fix the PR issue? - Unfortunately, still dealing with the backlash. Latest reports are saying that Harris Corp is the CIA secret weapon. That we're killing women and children indiscriminately in Afghanistan and so on. I can kill the stories on all the networks by the end of the week but it's gonna cost us. - Pay it, I want this shut down as soon as possible. - Roger that. - Next order of business, finance. - Ma'am, we're losing market share both to Blackstone and XRC. They're taking more and more of the US contracts and the Brits haven't hired us in 16 months. - I'm not worried about the Brits right now. But the US contracts are our bread and butter. Gentlemen, this means war. Jamal. - Ma'am? - Make a list of Blackstone's operatives to XRC. Tell them we'll give them stock in exchange for cleaning house. - Cleaning house? - One competitor is manageable. Two is a problem. Make XRC eliminate Blackstone or buy them out. Otherwise, we'll do it ourselves. Got it? - Got it. - Go on, McCoy. - Xiang Qi Shu just bought another thousand shares. - Keep an eye on that. Don't do anything right now but if he purchases even one more share of stock, I wanna know about it. Gentlemen, this is not casual Friday. - Yes, ma'am. - The experiment has been decommissioned as ordered? - It's done. All subjects were terminated with extreme prejudice. All confirmed kills, all made to look like accidents. - All verified? - Of course. I oversaw the entire operation myself. - Damon, you look like you have something to say. Go ahead, spit it out. - Well, it's just that all the bodies were burned, car explosion, stove explosion, etcetera... But in three of the locations, none of the subject's DNA was found on any of the surfaces and there were slight inconsistencies in the dental records and no outward sign of struggle. - All of which make for a great bedtime story for conspiracy theorists. Look, ma'am, all due respect, the operation was shut down as ordered. The end. No one outside this room will ever, ever know the experiment ever existed. - And the operative? - KIA, ma'am. - Who was it? - David Shepard. No family, no next of kin. - Very well, gentlemen. That will be all. - Agent Douglas. - They know. That's impossible. - I'm telling you, it's just a matter of time. - Is this line secure? - You guaranteed me. Relax, Agent Douglas. Everything is under control. You hired me to do a job and unfortunately we had some setbacks. - Setbacks? - But we're working on it. - What setbacks? Nasim, what setbacks? - We seem to have a competitor. Someone else knows the true potential of the specimen. This competitor lead us to the specimen And now... - Oh, man. Do you know what they call it when you sell a top secret weapon to a foreign national? Huh? - Agent Douglas. - They call it treason, Nasim! Treason, okay? And do you know what happens when you commit Treason? - I can fix this, Mr. Douglas. - They fucking kill you! They kill you. - I assure you that you will not be harmed. - And if I go down, Nasim, you go down too. You hear me? Yeah, I'm gonna tell them all your dirty little secrets. I'm gonna make sure they send your fucking ass to GITMO! You hear me, you son of a bitch?! Get those girls back, Nasim! Hello? Hello? - Don't worry, Mr. Douglas. We will recover the girls. - Okay, fine. Fine. Let me know when it happens. - Goodbye, Mr. Douglas. - Hey. While we're sitting here, let me ask you something. What's up with Shepard? - I don't know, he's an asshole? What do you want from me? - Well, where is he? - Was it my turn to watch him? Look, will be back with a team. - Yeah, when is that? - Really? We are really doing this right now? - I'm just saying. I think its pretty stupid to separate the team. Its illogical. One of us is gonna end up dead. - Damn, Garcia, we are not gonna fall apart and get killed just cause one guys absent for a few weeks. - Yeah? What if he gets killed? - Then well, dead men feel no pain. So I guess he'll be fine either way. - Vasquez? - Yeah? - When this mission is over, remind me to kick your ass. - Clear! - Clear! - Clear! - Shepard! Shepard! Shep! Come on out, buddy. You know how this ends. You should of just killed those whores, Shep. We know you faked their deaths. You brought this on yourself. - Walk away, gentlemen. There's more at stake here than you know. - Clear. - Clear. - You guys are like family. I don't want to hurt any of you. - You put us in this situation, you asshole. It was a simple order. 700 kills and then you get cold feet? - These girls are innocent. - You're a mercenary, you idiot. You're not a hero. You had a mission and you failed. Now you have to pay the price. The same price we all pay when we fail. Go. So have some fucking self respect and give yourself up. - Listen to me. - Clear! - All of you. - Clear. - Clear. - You know me and you know I'm no fool. I'm doing something that needs to be done here. If you leave my house right now I'll let you live. - I hate to tell you this, buddy, but you're a little out gunned, Shep. Let's not do this the hard way. Last chance, Shepard. Give it up. This day comes for all of us in this business, Shepard. Today just happened to be yours. - No, my friend. Today is your day. - 25 years. 25 years in the Air Force. The last five been on loan to the Agency. 25 years, 10 deployments, and over 100 covert missions and still my own operative thinks he can sneak up on me in my own home. - I don't sneak. I'm here to talk. - Talk? Now you want to talk. It takes a special kind of man to do what you did. Reckless. Desperate. - Effective. - Dangerous. - So I'm a liability? That's why you tried to kill me. - You failed at the simplest mission I ever gave you and then you disappear with the targets? Who does that? - The mission changed. - I decide the mission, Shepard. Or did you forget that? And to answer your question, if I had known how disloyal you were, I might of sent the team out to kill you but the fact is I did not. - Then who did? - We had a mole from XRC. Rodger. The man who came after you. XRC had a bounty on the girls. Rodger led the mission to kill you but I didn't send him. - I guess I misjudged you. - You think? Take that stupid voice modulator off. - NSA has voice recognition technology. If they can hear you. - They can track you. I know. I know how it works. Who do you think worked on the prototype? Lot good it did you. You know I should of fired you two years ago when Eve died. - Leave her out of this. - No, I won't. Its true. I told you not to marry her. Love is cursed in this business. - Excuse me, ma'am, there's a lady with a visitors badge who says she has a 10 PM appointment but I don't see her on the roster, she has no clearance. I'll just tell her to... - Send her in. Its okay, last minute, no time for protocol but she's okay. Send her in. Hello, Danielle. - Hello, Mrs. Shepard. - You're early. I like that. Have a seat. - Thank you. - Well as you might imagine, we already know everything about you that you could possibly tell me in an interview. Sign here. Follow me. - Ma'am. What did I just sign? - Constitutional waiver. If you ever breathe a word about what you've seen today, you'll be killed without trial. - I understand. - Back to my office. Put this on. Go sit at my desk. Now I want you to look at the screen and when I get back, you will give me an analysis of the genetic data and its strategic potential for weaponization. That is your interview. I'll be back in a few. Hey, my love. - Hey. - You sound happy to hear from me. How's your business trip going? - Its been a blast so far. - Glad to hear it, baby and the presentation? It went well, I take it? - I'd say I killed. - That's the David I know. Hey, what's all that noise? - Sorry, can't talk too much. Hey babe, got to go. - David, hey hey, David I need to tell you something. Are you listening? I love you with all my heart, okay. Don't you ever ever forget that. Tell me you understand. - Eve, babe. - Go now, we've been hit. Everybody, move go. Now! Get out of here! - Eve. Was the only truly innocent person I ever met. And I, just couldn't protect her. So yeah, I lost it. I just poured myself into the job. Every kill was about her. I became a monster. So when you gave me the five target assignment, I was ready to go. When I found out they might be connected to her death. I couldn't ignore that. - I apologize for the secrecy and holographic image but it was the only safe way to get the message to you without detection. Your wife, Eve, did not die in the explosion as you probably believe. Was killed before she could expose them. The Psychodyne experiment sought to eradicate illness by harvesting extraterrestrial DNA from the Roswell crash site and using it to create humans immune from all disease. Unfortunately, the experiment required testing on newborns without their parents consent or knowledge. Eve discovered computer files proving this. Was killed before she could expose them. I know I am next. Government agencies suspect foul play now and that's why those involved are tying up loose ends. There are five women who survived the Psychodyne experiment. They are the only ones who can prove what I'm saying and they are marked for death. If they appear on your company's target list please do the right thing. Don't let Eve's death be in vain. - Yeah Shepard. I'm about to do something crazy and I can't order you to do it but I need my team. Copy that. - What are you about to do? - Damn, Dad, I almost killed you. - What are you about to do? - Its top secret, classified. - You know if your mother... - Don't. - All I'm trying to tell you, son is life is worth living. Yes, you lost your wife and your mother. I lost a wife, too. - You left a wife and you weren't there to save her and your enemies came to get her. I wasn't either. - You know, I've been prosecuting bad people for a long time. Sometimes, good people get caught up in the crossfire. You can't blame yourself. - If I don't do this, it will be my fault. - What's the key for? - Safe deposit box. In case... - And you didn't think to check with me first? - I didn't know who I could trust. No offense. My plan was to capture the girls and find out the truth. If the story was a lie I was gonna finish the job. But if it was true... Things would get complicated. - The story's true. I mean it has to be. I found out too late to warn you but the kill order came from the highest levels. I'm talking, I'm talking Veeps, Joint Chiefs, Sec Def and with private funding. - Well, Mr. Vice President... - Shut up, John, just shut up. This whole thing is your baby. You're the one that caused me to support it and you said, and I quote, "This is gonna be the next step in human evolution." - Well what I actually said, sir... - And you, Jerry, you signed off on this and you said we were gonna have a battlefield multiplier that was gonna save American lives. That's what you guys said. - And it still... - I'm talking now. 995 babies that died because of this stupid experiment. Babies, which I found out much too late had already been stolen from their parents. Now we're gonna have to live with that but let's talk turkey. Gentlemen, government resources were used to commit mass murder. Now, the fact that it was an accident, its irrelevant but make no mistake, if we don't clean this mess up now its not just political suicide, we will all quite literally die. Now, you can talk. How are we gonna fix it? - Respectfully, sir, that's why we're here today. The gentlemen who are here will give us the answers that we need. - They better, Jerry, for all of our sake. - Gentlemen, let me put your minds at ease. Harris Corp is about completing the mission at any cost. That's our brand. You want us to make the problem disappear? Consider it done. Within 14 days, this experiment, its scientists and anyone who knew anything about the experiment will be erased. - We need it done in seven. - That will cost double. But we can make it happen. If you don't mind my asking, the girls don't actually know they were part of the experiment. Why the priority on killing the girls instead of focusing on the witnesses? - If the results of this test is holding fast to what we believe to be true its only a matter of time before these girls gradually develop their abilities and this causes talk and people to trace back to their roots and if this gets back to National Laboratories. - Say no more. You'll be pleased, I assure you. There is one loose end, though, I see. The owner of the Psychodyne patent, he needs to be eliminated, yet you've provided no information on him at all. Do you not want him killed? - The patent holder is anonymous. The revenue goes into a secret bank account in Switzerland. We've looked for him for years and haven't been able to find him. The inventor of the process, Eve Shepard, was killed a couple of years ago in a National Laboratory terror attack. He has remained in hiding. He's like a ghost. But we will keep looking for him. Your job is to clear up the rest of this mess. - Understood. Good day, gentlemen. - Since it was such a sensitive mission, I thought I would trust it to who I thought was my best operative. - That hurts. - Good. - I followed protocol. I did my research but the more I found out, the more I knew what I had to do. - Louisa. - Hola? - Luisa Montoya? The one who sent you the video. - Do I know you? - No. But I think you will. I need to ask you a question and then I'll tell you anything you want to know. - What? - What do you see in the video? - The only happy moment in my childhood. - Good answer. Your luck is getting better. I just saved your life. Cuffs are for your protection. I'm not gonna hurt you. - Okay. Are you one of Miguel's men? Cause I can pay back the money. I was just borrowing it really. Its like a little joke. - I'm not one of Miguel's men. - So who you are? - I'm sorry. Today I'm your protection. Tomorrow, I'll be your nightmare. But you'll thank me for it in the end. Don't flatter yourself. Shit! - My god! - Miguel's men? - No, he wouldn't chase me so far for 5,000 euros. I have no idea who they are. We are so dead! - Hold this. - What is this? - Grenade. - Oh my gosh! - Sit tight. One down. - go, go! Shut up! Go. Shut up! Shut the fuck up! Now where did he go? - I need a fucking hospital. - Shit, I'm out of bullets. - Out of ammo. Oh shit, there he is. Damn that piece of shit Get him, get him. Take a note you fucking dirt bag! - Please let me go, they're gonna kill us. - I got this. Siri, sonic blast. - I think you said Son of Sam. - No! Sonic blast, damn it, sonic blast! - What the hell just happened? - I don't know you tell me. - You must of done something wrong. - Get your gun, get your gun. - Sonic blast initiated. - do you bad day, too? - Something like that. - Get your gun! - After I saved Luisa, I took her to a safe house. Asked Garcia to watch her while I went after the other girls. Let's just say, she's not the nurturing type. - What? - Ma'am, there's an electrical outage in the neighborhood. I need to check your breakers. - Our breakers are fine, thanks. - Ma'am, this is routine. I need to check your electrical breakers. - Fuck off! - Luisa didn't do anything supernatural in front of me so for all I knew, I had the wrong girl. Amber was different. She remembered but she couldn't prove it. Ms. Reid. My name is David Shepard. I'm here to defend you. Look, I know you've been through a lot you've been through some tough police investigations but let's face it, case against you is pretty strong. We have motive, murder weapon, fingerprints. Right now, the evidence is telling the story that you won't. You wouldn't believe me. - Try me. - Just go away. - Okay, I'll go. Its my duty to inform you that in this state there is a mandatory death penalty for domestic violence. They're gonna fry you, Ms. Reid. Now anyone who wants to die that bad must be guilty. - I didn't kill my husband. - Then who did? - Nobody. I mean. Evan was a piece of shit. He cheated on me all the time. I knew it but I couldn't say anything. I never confronted him because, well because of this. He would beat me all the time. So bad I couldn't move for days. And he would hit me in the body so that the marks wouldn't show. I was like a hostage. Don't get me wrong, I loved him. God, I loved him. Now that he's dead, I feel so free. More free than I have in years. Ironic, right? - So how did he die? - I swear to you, I don't know. I mean, I saw it. I don't believe it. I came home from work and he had the other woman in my bed. I started cursing him. I got so mad I ran up and I smacked him. She ran away. He started kicking me and punching me and well, you see... I just, I prayed that I would pass out. I prayed but I just stayed awake taking the blows. Blow after blow. Somehow I made it to the kitchen. He followed me. I grabbed a butter knife, a dull butter knife. He laughed at me. I'm standing there, bleeding from my eye and my lip and this fucker thinks its funny? That's when it happened. - It? - I just imagined the knife being sharp enough to cut the shit out of him. I was just so angry and so tired that I just... Then the knife, it just, it just flew out of my hand and into his neck. Listen, mister, you got to help me. I'm not a killer. Please, I swear. I know I sound crazy but you have to believe me. I didn't do it... - I believe you. - You do? - Yes, I do. - Wait, who the fuck are you? You're not an attorney... - Never said I was an attorney. I said I'm here to protect you. - Excuse me. I'm Aaron Davis, my sisters Amber Reid. Can you tell me what room number she's in? - Mr. Davis, your sister can't have any visitors right now. Thing is your sister's severely injured. I take it you weren't close? - Oh uh, well yeah. Its been awhile. Exactly what kind of injuries? - Well your sister has severe internal bleeding. Extensive organ damage, and quite frankly I haven't seen anyone in her condition survive. The thing is, your sister is under arrest. Her husband was found stabbed to death and they seem to think that she committed the murder. She couldn't have possibly done this. - Thank you, doctor. You've been very helpful. - Mr. Davis. Mr. Davis, I feel it. Somethings not right here. Your sister didn't do this. She couldn't have done this. There's something fishy and its a good thing you got that lawyer. - Lawyer? Oh. Well its good to see which side you're on. - Breathe, breathe. If I wanted to kill you, you'd be very dead. Do you remember me? Don't. Here's your reality. One, you're wanted for murder and two, someones trying to kill you. - Why? Why me? - I think you know why. - I didn't ask for any of this. Oh god. Now those two stories together, that was enough for me. After that, I had a new mission. Capture the girls and train them to stay alive long enough to expose the conspiracy. This was my only shot at getting justice for what happened to Eve. - Maybe you should stay away from the windows till you figure out who's trying to kill you. - Something feels off. - Finish telling me why you disobeyed orders and went rogue. - Just drive. I'll tell you the way. You look familiar. Have I seen you before? Maybe at the club? - No I'm not. I'm not a baller. - So how long have you been doing this? - Too long. - I bet you get a lot of taxi cab confessions, right? You want to hear one? Its a big one. - Well its your dime on my time. Fire away. - I made 12 grand tonight. - See what I mean? Big money girl. Too rich for my blood. - That I stole a lot of it. Oh shit. I left the money in my locker at the club. You have to take me back. Look, I know its a pain but I swear, I'm good for it, honest. Come on. I'm sure you can come in with some understanding. You got something I want, I got something you want. I can do some amazing things. - I know you can, Hailey. The new mission was challenging. Back at the safe house, it was becoming a mess. I stashed the other two girls at a different location. Garcia had her hands full but I couldn't be in two places at once. I'm surprised they survived her. - Do you plan on feeding us any hot food? - So how long have you known Mr. Shepard? I mean, he must be pretty important for you to risk your live, too. - Let's get this straight. I am not your friend. I'm am stuck here babysitting you until your Mr. Shepard gets his ass back here and for some reason, he is willing to risk his life for you. If something happens to him, I will kill all of you and collect a nice big bounty. Try me. - I need some blow. Got some? - You still owe me for the last one. You know I don't play that. - I got what you need. Here, Nadia. - Okay. I have some new stuff if you're interested. This right here, place it under your tongue, it will take you to a whole new world. - Give me some of it, too. What? I got this, Cassie. And besides, you have that sugar daddy. - Sugar daddy? I have a boyfriend with money. Nadia has a sugar daddy. Right? Miss marriage. - What I told you? I told you to stay after you poison, they until he was dead. - But he... - Sit the fuck down. In this town, I decide who get clipped and who walks away. Who lives and who dies. Me, Salvatore Nucci. Not you. This bitch is done. Cancel her contract. - Contract canceled. - Sorry. - Sorry doesn't pay the bills. Now shut up and listen. You call your other boss and you tell him that I have some new product for him. A 20 something Chinese girl and a preteen Mexican. I want 30,000 dollars for each. Cash. If you fail me again even being my daughter will not save you. - So, miss Destiny. How is unemployment treating you? Well, let's see. Louis something something something Martinez. 600 dollars, nice. Ryan Winslow the third. Sounds rich. 200 dollars. Cheap bastard. Probably live with momma and daddy. Jamal Jenkins. Kinda cute, I might have to give you a ring, partner. Oh jackpot! Make it rain, JJ. Yes. You sir, I think you deserve a round two. New outfit, new scam, same guy and a happy ending. Nah, too risky. Well I guess what they say is true. Nothing beats a great pair of legs. - Cannot agree more with you. Sit your ass down. - There's almost 3,000 dollars there. Just take it and go. I don't wan your fucking money, I'm here for you - Whoever you are, walk away. - You're kinda cute. - You pulled this at the worst possible time, Shepard. I called a meeting to order the manipulation of XRC to eliminate Blackstone. But it backfired. They came after us. They killed all of my operatives. Except you. - They definitely tried. Everywhere we went, they found us. - Bitch, you pull the trigger, you're gonna be the next to die. - Bitch, call me a bitch again. Say it. So everyone can hear you, come on. - Garcia, what are you doing? Stick to the plan. - Garcia. - Where the hell have you been? She's crazy. - Our survival depends on them and you know that. Let her go. - Your time is coming. You just wait. - You little... - Inside! - What? - Its you, me, Vasquez, and Rob against the entire Intelligence community. These girls are an arsenal. We need them. - What if these girls are duds, huh? You want me to risk my life for that trash out there? - What is your problem? - What is my problem? That is my problem. - Get inside! - Get them. I'll find you. I'll keep you safe. I'll be fine. Go! - Why did they keep you alive? - His wife owed me a favor. - What kind of favor? - We had an encounter. We had an encounter and I could of killed her but I let her live. - I'm here for you. - Whoever you are, walk away. - Well. If that's the story you're going with I guess I will have to accept it. Well for now. We have work to do. - I thought Harris Corp was finished? - Harris is finished. I'm not. Let's just say that we have been resurrected by a very unlikely source. Sir, you remember two weeks ago, the psychodyne project, cash contract? I sent a representative to meet with the Veep and the chairman of the joint chiefs of... You have no idea that that meeting took place? - Tell me more, Yvonne. Tell me everything you know about the psychodyne project. - Sir, I swear to you I had no idea that they were trying to cover up a mass murder. As contractors we serve the interests of the United States and we operate on a need to know basis. - Relax, Yvonne, I know you didn't know. Want to hear a secret? I can't believe I got reelected. Now frankly, I didn't even want to run again. As a half Columbian, half nobody white guy from Harlem running on a platform on an America for everybody, I guess I was a fan favorite from the beginning. It was almost too easy. You probably voted for me, too, huh? - No sir. To be quite honest, I thought you were too idealistic to make good on most of your promises. - Touche, and you were right. I ran for president to make a difference and now four years later, I realize that Washington is an apocalyptic wasteland filled with gutless snakes who are more concerned with their own political survival than making the world a better place. Nowadays, evil people throw stones then hide the hand. Terrorists hide in mountain caves or in countries that won't extradite them. Dictators commit genocide while the UN resolves to find diplomatic solutions for atrocities they've already committed. Here in this country, murderers hide behind the Constitution or public opinion that disfavors killing the killers. Yvonne, I want you to create a task force that reports directly to me. Its a sort of splinter cell of the secret service. Your mission will be to exact real justice. - With all due respect, I'm ruined. My company is decimated and almost all my operatives have been killed. - Almost? - A small group of operatives went rogue during the psychodyne fiasco. I know about the murdered babies but I think they're protecting the girls. - I'll be damned. - Sir? - These operatives are willing to risk their own lives by taking on the entire intelligence community just to save five innocent people? That, Yvonne, is exactly what I need. Heroes, real heroes. Do this and I will give you everything you need, money, training facilities, weapons, whatever. If you want to make real difference in this world, put this team together and you will become the most powerful clandestine fighting force this world will never see. Known only to my inner circle as the Cell. - So. If you have the team, the president is willing to spend big money to... - Fiance clandestine operations off the books. - So? The million dollar question is where are the girls? - They're in a safe place. I would of brought them with me but I kinda thought you were trying to murder me. Can you keep them safe? - The president can. I tell you what. Why don't you write the coordinates of where they are and I'll have a team sent to pick them up? - Its not exactly grid coordinates. But this is what I've got for you. But this is what I've got for you. How do I know I can trust you? Yeah, you can trust me, too.
