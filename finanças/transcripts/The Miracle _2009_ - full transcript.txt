Life changes sometimes. -Was it a miracle or not? - No. - Can you swear? I can not...

We ought to invite you officially? - Sit Alexander. - I'm leaving! -I'll go to school without breakfast . - Sasha! Sit ... Let him in his fight . - He has problems at school. - I know! They started earlier today. What happens in the city? - How should I know? We rare go to the city. - Why? What people say about it? They talk about the miracle of Sikalova. She is still marbled... And do you believe in this miracle? Do not believe it! I know what I'm saying. - Believing in God is more difficult,from stories and irrational things, which some believe blindly. - What are you talking about? I only believe in our Lord Jesus Christ. - Sasha! - Where are you going? - Sasha took the reeds and left. - Come back. - See, it stung. We need more quickly . Bravo! You dont want to go to school! The children are fooling you! -They are fooling me,too. I said "Oolychronio" to the kings It was just an old hymn "Polychronio". Now no longer used. I do not care about your "Polychronio". For this you must deny your parents? You know that no one will understand why you did it. -I will go to constructions - In about five years you can go. If you leave earlier,the police will searching for you. If you denounce me. Your grandfather was a simple village priest. He had 5 children ... It was another era! My grandfather died recently. You say that he died... He did not die, Sasha,he was at home ... in his bed, surrounded by those who cared for him and of their love. To the boards of directors,in isolated beds... Yes, there the spirit suffers horribly. This is his Cross. May God rest his soul,servant of Christ. And you got such a soul? You put a cross around your neck for one simple reason, to be crucified in this... Even the Savior flinch in the garden of Gethsemane, woe to us,the sinners. I get on my cross. You should stay in your cross, to resurrect subsequently. Did you consider that? Isn't it right? I thought about it! You? He is Michael Borisovits. Please sign. And something else ...preach as you think best. Hello! It is the sermon... burn it. "woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel!" I see no connection. The world is physicist, except of two miracles: The starry sky and the moral law that grows within us. We have Kant here. Let him burn! Do you want something? Do you want to tell me something? - Michael Borisovits is educated. - I think that he is distorted. - And good. - Very good. I think that... This will help you when the church shut down. -You paint yourself... Look... Your lips ... They are painted. Obviously . Go! Go to the kids! Do not dare to touch their mother. You have no lipstick ... In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. - Amen. Today is Sunday of Forgiveness . You need to prepare yourselves for the Great Lent without malice in the heart,asking forgiveness of our sins for the offenses and the agony the possibility of erring without permission. You need to put repentance even when you do not feel any guilt . Because,the lack of awareness of our sinfulness, is a big deception. There are no people here without sin...we are all sinners. Children injustice from their mothers,women from their men because of our sinful nature. But God forgives and have mercy on all sinners. But requests from people clemency and forgive our debtors, To forgive as many times as requested by the Lord "seventy times seven " So today I ask you: Please forgive me my brothers, me, your unworthy priest, for the sins that I done many times. Forgive me! -May God forgive you! - Forgiveness and Love ... These two heals the evil of this world after the fall. And something yet... Pray with your heart more. But I did not want to just tell you that today. There are rumors in the city, some of which have begun since January. Faith is no longer enough, we asking for miracles and signs from heaven girls who have stuck with icons in their hands. We have around us, many other wonders less obvious but equally wonderful. Dont you think that life itself is the greatest miracle? around us there are billions other planets , dead , gigantic material bodies without a soul and God. And suddenly,to a small blue planet are countless animals forests of rare beauty, primary sense of joy. Do you need bigger miracles? are you really scribes and Pharisees? The most important miracles of God, we can see in all the earth, are the starry heavens and the moral law that grows within us. Amen. Amen. They came to get you. Get ready to get you. Take all your clothes. Can I have five minutes? Give me a cigarette. Say it to Sasha... Better not say anything. I'm ready.. I must go. - Well,there are no miracles? Is that right father Andrei? There are. - I want more convincing. Nor were there ever? Allow me! in the name of Christ. - There is no miracle? - Get thee behind me Satan! - There is no miracle! This is what you said to the sermon. - Father Andriy be more courageous. More courageous. - There is no miracle! Isn't it what you say? - I want to hear. There are no miracle? There seems Father not to be ashamed. Didn't they sending you? Next ! To say it simply,I have not gotten even a liter. Do they found a midst Father? Next! - I want to see the ship, No midst are shown here. - Put some for me,too. - Have you seen a priest to drink vodka with beer? Big Miracle! - You can climb on the flatbed? - If you allow me... -I'm going to the train station. - We leave you to the crossroads. Throw it, Valerian Gkrigkoref. If does not save us, anyway we will fall. - Do you know any prayer? Woe to your life! Every educated person, should know a prayer. APRIL I do not know any. What should we do? try to get higher without a prayer. What else can I hear my brave people? Storm, Nikita Sergeyevich. Try a forced landing. -Where? - In a military airport. Or to a field, as soon as possible. Tell me, for to know where I am. - We are in Gkritsansk, Nikita Sergeyevich. - Gkritsansk? Have you heard of this place? Okay, keep them! - You have'nt a real winter here. - No, there is a regulation that prohibits. - For those funny Visarionovits Joseph, normally you must be executed on the spot. Chill out, what's wrong? Scared? There will be punishments. The Socialist Law will never break! - You can sit in fron . - I have to get off. - What do you know about this city ? The Gkritsansk, Valerian Gkrigkoref? - I'll look and let you know. - Primitive habits! It appears to be Soviet territory. - Nikita Sergeyevich... - Tomorrow comrades Tomorrow they will sing and dance, and now let me sleep. - Thank you from my heart Thats ok! Do not bother, lads. Valerian! Nikita Sergeyevich... I remembered. In Gkritsansk a sect is triggered,and promoted anti -Soviet ideas. What do you think about this? I can not think,I'm looking for bugs. Yes, bugs... It is a major political issue. Where are you looking at? Look here. Catch it. I see you are very sensitive. The trenches and pill-boxes was full of bed bugs. During the war I saved by kerosene. I could not sleep if I did not poured kerosene on the bed. - And now there is war. - What do you mean when you say that there is war? War - will be up to full building of communism. So, with the cult? -It is not a usual sect. It's complicated. A medical case... - Tomorrow we will go to their center. What solutions do we have? - The solution is simple ... to demolish the hotel and make a new one. - I say to tear down the entire city. Good night. - Good night. - further down, further down,you deaf! - See? Here, please. - It's hot here. - It is very hot Nikita Sergeyevich. - Beware! - Will badly tans someone here. Nikita Sergeyevich attention. Look Nikita Sergeyevich . What is this? You are. - I think that is one of the wrong perceptions. Remove it immediately! Do not you know the recent decisions from the Court of the Communist Party? Do you want to create a new personality cult? Not tired with bugs of communism? We're not going to have another cult. And no, especially bedbugs will not have it. Unhang this and put Lenin. Hear, Valerian ; You have no portrait of Lenin. Only this,that you have here? The person responsible for the religions? - Yes... Kontrasof! - Kontrasof, incharge of worship. - What happen to your eye? -It is missing. -Give me reference. Antireligious propaganda work. Nobody goes to church. The Talmud, the sacred dances and superstitions have stopped. - Exactly. - Okay. I want details . Are there any sects? Where are they? Who leads them? Does anybody goes to church? Answers and look me in the eyes! - The only church in town is almost closed. - You did not close it yet? You should have close the church! Do you know it? - I know. -Let me hear the answer! Why? Why to close the only church in town? Your reply! Tell ! For people who will build communism is opium in mind, and outdated lies. Do you understand ? We do not need new slaves. Slaves did not build communism, but Soviet citizens with education and work. Repeat ! -We do not need new slaves. - Exactly. And the girls do not get marble. - Not at all. Let's go. -Yes, this miracle happened ,this phenomenon is shameful for communism An old woman told us for marbling. The Regional Committee recommended the Health Committee to clarify this phenomenon. And the Health Committee tried, but without success ... In conclusion, this led to reduction of work produced. Someone is behind this, someone to blame ... And you? What have you done? We organized patrols, checkpoints, guards,we do no catch anyone. I called the local bishop to help the problem to be solved. Valerian, the local Bishop! Come on everyone! -Shine! O New Jerusalem! The Glory of the Lord has shone on you! Exalt now and be glad, O Zion! Be radiant, O Pure Theotokos, in the Resurrection of your Son! Christ is risen from the dead, trampling down death by death, and upon those in the tombs bestowing life! Hey, Bishop citizen. You're dressed in gold ? - We celebrate the Easter. And why in gold ? They have money for gold vestments,and not for infrastructure? - The church has a budget. - It's not fair. It should not be like this. Even churches should be simple! Everyone, get out of here! Valerian,you stay here. - Well ! And what are you doing here? -We read the Greetings of St. Nicholas the Hierarch. Thank God. - To read more? - Exactly. God does not exist. God exists! Exists! God is justice and communism. God is the truth! - What is the "truth" ? In front that you fought to war? Am I loosing my words? However, you do not understand anything. The Church was separated from the state. She remained as the "Parliament of Fools" ! We want to increase the standard of living, and to win the bells! - I fought in the Second Front of Belarus. I got a medal. -When were you born? - In 1900. And you ? - In 1894. - Then you must be baptized. - And what happened? -You do not walk correctly. We must work together. You must take care of the body and the soul of the young people. Only then we can move forward. It seems to me that... Crossing yourself when we appear. We are the authorities. You are guided by the principles. We believe in material progress. And you will not have to spend them. You will not succeed. You will disappear by yourself. Without any effort of our part. By the way,you're throwing away the room to tell its "Greetings"! - I can not... - What is this statue ? - Valerian, go. - You may need something Nikita Sergeyevich? What ... has ...at hands? An Icon of St. Nicholas the Bishop. You have it like that... take the Icon. - Okay! I ...must not... But we have! - Impossible. - I said I should! It will be better! - I can not. I'll take ... this. Nah ... I can not. - It is impossible, we need an innocent child. -Havent you found so far? -No. -Why? - Because you have closed all the monasteries, where to find an innocent? - God knows! In this city all answers is that "do not" and "not found". - Get back! Everybody back! Back! Back! Back! Get back! Back! Levsin - shoot ! -Do not shoot! I said do not shoot! -You are lustrated. -Without my order,they do not shoot anyone. Why are you shout,comrades? Hello! - Hello! - Nikita Sergeyevich, is the second week that we do not have the basic goods. -They give the salt with coupons. We do not have sugar or sweets for our children. - The roads are very bad, Nikita Sergeyevich! Help us. - Listen, listen comrades! I'll see how can I help! - We will arrange those to the ministries! They sit there and enjoy in Moscow and Gkritsansk... Gkritsansk is Soviet land too! They have a chauffeur outside their offices with luxury cars! That derived from the factory which you work. We have weaknesses, comrades,but soon you will overcome them. I started a development strategy of our socialist economy for 7 years At the end of these 7 years we will have all of the goods. Kiev will not predominates from the Gkritsansk to nothing, and Gkritsansk will be like Moscow. - And now we have an issue. You should help us, comrades. - We need an innocent. - A kid. - Some women, don't know. - I found some! - Is he innocent? What's your name? - Sasha! -Who is your family? - His father is a priest. Was, when we have kings. And where is your father? -He escaped! I was looking for him for a month, but eventually I found him, Nikita Sergeyevich. - Get down from there! -Mind your head Nikita Sergeyevich. - I found an innocent. - What kind of innocence is he? He's just a student. Tell me what to do. - The icon of St. Nicholas the Bishop. Can you get it from her hands? - Why? What is this city ? How communism will build? -The icon. Dont you hear? - Come on! - Got it. - Come on, Valerian Gkrigkoref. There is no matter anymore. Goodbye comrades! - The icon! - Here! What is your conclusion from all this? Was it something important or not? - I think it was nothing. - I think so, I think that everything was organized by the bishop. He will be rebuked by the party. - Do you think that he is a member of the party? -I'm not sure. Although he fought in Belarus. Unless he lied. You can not believe priests today. The miracle is something else. -They are rare anymore. With or without handcuffs. - And what is the conclusion? - The conclusion is simple. Grab your stick and they getting render wise. -No... I can not ... I dont want. - Otherwise do not do nothing. Why dont you want? - You know very well Nikita Sergeyevich. That in Russia,people are like this. That is nice! This is greatness! Like a flying angel. -There are no angels to the clouds. What the clouds are? Water in gaseous form, in phase of condensation. - So, Valerian ... The party will make cleanups. - How about the eggs of sturgeon this year? -Must have matured. - I say we go up, for fishing. - It's early yet, the water is still cold. - Last year I was there this time. -Don't tell me.
