Good morning. Man: I raise my hand... Who else has raised his or her hand? Get up, man! You're a fool. Hey, hey! What happened? You pretty near bought the farm, you drunken old son of a bitch! Ha! The hell I did. Ha ha ha! You lay around on them railroad tracks and you'll have no legs, by golly! Well, at least I would have a matched set! Ha ha ha! Hey, Haney. Whatcha say? Hot enough for you? Yo, Haney. How you doin'? Hey, Leo. You're not going to eat? I'm practicing. Here. Give me this. I'll catch a few. I just about got my nut for today. Well, don't throw your arm out. All right, right down the pike. Rose made me damned deviled egg sandwiches again. Tell her you didn't like 'em? She's kind of sensitive. You know that. Ha ha. Well, we're just talking about a sandwich here, for Christ's sake. Tell her you don't like 'em. Tell her to make you what you want. You been married to her a year. You ought to be able to get away with that. I'm thinking about making my own-- peanut butter and jelly. They're good for you, easy to make. You better rub some of that on your elbow. It'll keep you loose. Chester, you think you got enough chicken there? Want to play cards tonight? Yes, sir. Jeannie taking them salmon patties out of the freezer just like clockwork. She sure knows how to cook 'em, don't she? Makes 'em taste just like fish. Now, boys, don't any of you take last night's game as a bad sign. Your luck's gonna turn around real soon. Who we got tonight, Alvin? We got the Dodgers by three. Right, the house has the Dodgers, fellas. But St. Louis has got a good pitcher on the mound. Damn, I think I'd bet on him myself. How come we don't have St. Louis, Alvin? Well, that's 'cause we want to give everybody a chance to win their money back. Aw, that sure is a Christian attitude. Won't you help us, Haney? You'd better get that away from me, Alvin. Ho ho! Okay, boys, come on! Who wants St. Louis? - They're looking good! - You don't think much of your money, do you, Leo? They got that Dominican kid going tonight. Well, hell, that ought to interest you, Gonzalez. Yes, sir! Hell, Gonzalez is from Mexico. He ain't no Dominican. Leo, I remember when all you done in here was eat your goddamn lunch! - How about St. Louis? - Better get out of my way, son! My man! - Alvin: Come on, fellas! - Okay, Spoon, what're we talking here? Haney, you ain't going to let 'em get to you, are you? Piss on him! I hate that dirty lowlife son of a butt, Leo. I don't want him around me. He upsets my bowels. Yeah, I know what you mean. Rose's bowels was upset all last night. Had the Hershey squirts. Well, tell her to eat plenty of Bran Flakes. Maybe a little jack cheese. There you go. Leo: I don't mean to meddle with your business. I never seen you drink three bottles of beer before, long as I known you. You ain't been listening to all this B.S. we've heard about the Southland turning into an air freight company, are you? They can't shut this line down. Hell, I got payments to make on the trailer and everything. What little bit Rose does, that ain't enough to contribute nothin' towards something like that. They're not gonna shut it down, Leo. They can't. - Wanna go bird hunting this weekend? - I can't do it, partner. I'm gonna take my grandchild fishing. I bought some new lures last Saturday-- big old purple worms about like that. Ain't had a chance to try 'em yet, of course. It was too hot to fish up till now, but it could be a nice trip. - You might want to go? - If you're askin'. Children: Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Get out of the car! Haney: Hey, what's going on here? Hold it, hold it. - What's going on here? - All: Grandpa! Grandpa! Where are you taking me? Grandpa, look at him go! Look at him, Grandpa! Well, here, looky here! There you go. - Girl: Knock him off! Knock him off! - What's this? Look out! What'd you do that for? Hey, he can ride! Grandpa, why don't you get on it?! - Not me, sir. I don't-- - All: Yeah! - No, no, no, no! - Yeah, yeah! - No, no, no, how about you? - Man: Hey, Daddy. How about a beer? So the big rodeo came to town, huh? Up in Little Rock. I got you and Mama tickets for Saturday. Honey, you want some cheese? I'll take some prunes if you got 'em. I went to the store. Billy? Prunes are fine. There you go, sir. Well now, big shot, what are you gonna enter? Daddy, this is what they call a permanent cast. I can't rodeo. So then why do you keep going? All my friends rodeo. I love it. I see. Well, it's a good thing I didn't only do what I love, isn't it? People around here might have starved right to death. Don't you think it's time you came down to the yard and see if you can't get on? I heard in the papers where Southland's going air freight. Where you been? I had to buy gas. Well, let's go inside. I can't. Man on TV: It's got a good dance beat. And there's no drum machines or anything like that. It's really us playing the music. I know that's the kind of thing people want to hear. So let me put this song on for you. Leo: Mmm! Yes, ma'am! I've been dreaming about salmon patties all day long. You make 'em the best, baby. You really do. Thank you, thank you. Jeannie? Bring the roll of paper towels in here to your grandma. And shug, would you turn down that music? That rock junk just rattles my brains. Jean: Turn it off, honey. - Oh, it's so good. - Thank you. Thank you, darlin'. - Come here, baby. - Here, Rose. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I better shuffle these cards up. Don't want to get grease everywhere. You boys have a lot of catching up to do. Haney: Sure, we do. Your partner's keeping score, and she's not adding it up right. You see, you girls don't have that many points. Well, let me look at it. You're cheating again, ain't ya? Hell, Haney, she's cheating. She's good at it too! - I'm not cheating! - Of course not. If you don't like the way I'm adding it up, just do it your damn self. Well now, let's don't get offensive about it. Where you been? I had to work late. Jeannie, get your stuff. And you, sir, what are you doing here? Me and Charlotte are gonna get married again. Is that a fact? Well, I do hope you two have grown up a little bit this time. Uh, well, we were thinking about moving to Tulsa. Everett knows a guy who works on the oil rigs. They get paid a lot more than railroad. Don't be dumb, son. Them oil rigs come and go. I said we were thinking, that's all. Charlotte: Look, I got you, um... some, uh... of these nose pads for your glasses. Thank you. They won't leave. I needed these. - Cicadas keeping you awake? - No, my darling. I was just sitting here thinking. About what? Well, I don't even know. Isn't that something about Charlotte and Everett? Yeah. I don't know what I'll do if Southland goes into air freight. You know, it ain't like I can go to some other railroad and get a job. I can't. Your boy's too old. You are worrying yourself about nothing. Maybe we could take a trip. - A trip? - Sure. Wouldn't you like to just go somewhere? Hell, I would. I mean, just go. I could get us a camper. Where would we go? Ha, could go anywhere we want. It wouldn't matter. I mean, that's the good thing about having a camper. Everything's going to be all right. Yeah. Yeah. Come on, Will. Come on. Come to bed. Come on. I'll be along in a minute. I'll be along. Man: Can't believe they... What does it say? It says, "Find yourself some other freakin' job." Where's Leo? Has anybody seen Leo? I don't want to move away from here, Haney. My mama's buried here. Well, I know, Chester. Ain't nobody gonna have to move away from here. Surely there's more to this thing than this sign here. I hope so. "This company has accumulated debts. It is more feasible to suspend operation..." I'm a son of a bitch. It's a lot of big words. They've done her to us, son. They've done her to us. Hey, son, why don't you come on over tonight? Hey, hold up. Hold up, man. We gotta figure out where we gonna move. Yo, we can't break up our bookie business. I tell you, this is just the excuse I need to get out of this rat's asshole of a town. I can't wait. Hey, come on, man. What is it? Lighten up. This ain't no big deal. It is a big deal, okay? I mean, this-- this sucks! I got a lot of family here, you know? I got a lot of family to think about. I got bills too-- a lot of 'em. Yeah. Wait, wait, wait, wait! You got a bill with me. Now don't forget, you owe me $575 I loaned you for this car. Man, you're gonna have to just write that off as a loss, okay? No, no, hold up. Hold up, man. Hey, hey! I ain't writing off shit, pal. You owe me that money. You gonna pay me that money. I need it for the move. Now come on, I got a kid. I got three damn kids! My car's on the blink-- - I don't give a damn, man. - Get the hell off. I need that damn money. Now where you goin'? - Hey, you hold on. I'm still talking to you. - Get off. Hey, I'm talking to you! God damn you! I'm gonna find you! I'm gonna find you and get your damn-- And I think she goes down there 'cause they have air conditioning. 'Cause it sure ain't how they do her hair. It looks terrible. Okay. Where is that-- Haney? Come here a second, shug. Come here. Leo's coming back for those damn dogs. I want you to do me a favor and take them this. Maybe it'll shut 'em up. Give them this. Those things drive me crazy morning and night. We might as well have a kid. Lord, you did not hear me say that. Leo: Come on, girls. Come on. Come on, Blue Bell. Come here, girl. - Hey, Leo? - Yo. Your wife sent this back to you. How much do you feed 'em, anyway? These dogs? I don't really know. I'd have to say a lot. They do eat a lot. I bet Rose knows exactly. I'll bet she does. Why wasn't you at work? Shop's closed. Everybody else showed up. How'd you know it was closed? I just had a feeling. You know how that is, Haney. Fella gets a feeling something's wrong. He don't know how he got it, but he knows something's wrong. What are you thinking we ought to do? What you want to do about the money, Everett? - Man: Miss Pat? - Miss Pat: What'll you have? Get me a longneck, please. Two. All right, everybody, listen up. We got some figuring we got to do. - Everybody listen up. - Hey, y'all. Haney's got a plan he wants to tell you about. Yeah, I got a plan too, about how I'm gonna take $575 out of some non-Caucasian's ass. Caucasian this, my friend. - Come here! - Hey, hey, hey! Man: Hey, hey, hey! Haney: Get off! Get off, damn you! You son of a bitch! I'll kill you! That's enough! Enough! All right, all right, let me go! Easy now! You want to fight like a couple of goddamn kids, just take it on outside! Y'all listen, Haney's got a damn plan here. Alvin: Yeah, yeah, go on, tell us, Haney! What brilliant plan is going to get the president of Southland to reopen this shop? We gonna tell Mr. President that we can handle more freight than any air freight outfit he's got in his mind. - Tell him? - Yeah. You gonna tell him? The man is in Chicago, Haney. We ain't gonna tell him shit! We are if we go to Chicago. Man: Oh, that costs money, Haney! - There's a plan. - That's a stupid plan. The hell it is. We're gonna get out of here tomorrow in this train yard and we're gonna put a couple of cars on that switch engine and we're gonna go to Chicago. And we're going to tell Mr. Thomas Clinton that we're ready to work here in Clifford, Arkansas. Farmers did it. Aw, come on, man! - Farmers. - Man: Hell, they're in worse shape than we are. But see, I didn't work here for over 38 years to have some son of a bitch tell me not to come back tomorrow. - Man: That's right. - I want my job back. And I'm going to let him know about it. Now you boys do what you want. I'll be at the yard at 6:30 rarin' to go. You show up if you feel the same. Man: I don't reckon it'd hurt anything. Man #2: I'll go, man. Man: Give it a try. What do we got to lose? Hey, Haney? I was goin' if I had to drive all the way to St. Louis and head you off. I got us some beer and lunch meat there at the 7-Eleven. Hell, it's just like they say-- open up at 7:00, shut down at 11:00. I was afraid I was gonna miss y'all. - Aw, hell, Haney. - That's right, boss. Not a one of 'em. Not a goddamn one of 'em showed up. That's pitiful. Dumb idea in the first place. Well, what do you think? Should we just go to Denny's and have a cup of coffee? Hell, no. I say we go. You and me. It might work better. Hell, yes. We can handle it. You bringing your gun? Dumb-ass idea, wasn't it? No, sir. I brought mine. Did you bring a necktie? Yes, sir. Brought two of 'em. Got a long one and a bow tie-- just depend on what mood I'm in. What's the whiskey for? - I got to keep the old arm loose. - All right, let's go. Go on. Aw, my car is like this every morning. Takes a while to warm it up. They say them Japanese cars run like a clock, start better than a Ford with a hand choke. Yeah, my niece's neighbor had one of them little "Hondos" or "Subunus" or something. 18-wheeler mashed it like a grape. Couldn't see it. Killed her, of course. Yes, sir, some sad singing and some slow walking. Yeah, there she goes. Chicago-bound. Haney: I guess this is as far away from home as I ever been. Puts me in mind of when I was a boy and I used to take my dad's pickup truck. A couple of buddies and I, we'd go out and see this bootlegger I used to know. Leo: You drink that old buzz-skull whiskey? Haney: I did. I didn't like the taste of it much, but I drank it anyway. Leo: You know, we used to have to take Grove's Chill Tonic every spring. That was the awfulest thing I've ever had-- my own opinion, of course. Haney: None of that stuff tastes very good. Serves a purpose. This is living, Leo. You know, Haney, I was taking a shower the other day and I was trying to remember the Pledge of Allegiance. You know, the American one. And, hell, I couldn't get it to come to me. Well, grade school was a long time ago. It's no wonder. Yes, sir. That's what kept me out of high school. "I pledge allegiance to the flag of these United States of America..." And then there's a little-- little more there. Yeah, something there about God, I think. Amen. That's important. Might be the most important. I don't know. Leo: "I pledge allegiance to the flag of these United States of America. And-- and God bless America, for which she stands." Haney: God bless America. Leo: Yes, sir. Gives you-- gives you a kind of a chill, don't it? Hello? Rose? Hi, it's Jean. Well, hi, honey. Did I wake you? No, I'm just cleaning up around the house. You know men. Yes. Listen, I was just wondering if you'd like to go shopping today. Well, sure. Hold on a second. Shut up! Jean? Didn't Haney and Leo say - that they were going bird hunting? - Yes. Well, if they did, they didn't take those damn dogs with them. - Shh. - Maybe they don't need the dogs. Well, if-- if they don't need them, I certainly don't need them. - I'm gonna turn 'em loose. - You are? No, I am. I'm gonna turn 'em loose. He is in for a big shock when he gets home. I'll see you later, honey. Bye. Shit! Shit, shit! Charlotte: You sure you don't mind watching Jeannie? I mean, I just think we ought to see what Tulsa's like. No, I'm glad for the help. I just wish you might have picked somewhere a little bit closer. I know I can find a job in Tulsa. I don't know about anywhere else. You won't know till you try, will you? That was Rose on the phone? Uh-huh. She's wondering why Leo and your dad didn't take the dogs with them when they went hunting. I must say, I think it's a little strange too. - Why? What time did they leave? - Early. You know, I bet those two old goats went out looking for work. What? What? Well, well, we had a meeting down at the Iron Horse last night. And they were talking about some stupid plan to steal a train. Yeah! Steal a train? Yeah. Yeah. But wasn't nobody gonna go with 'em. Aw, hell, they're probably down at Denny's drinking coffee and cussin' about it. Why were they gonna steal a train? Where were they gonna go? They were-- they were gonna go to Chicago. Now I don't think they're going. Chicago? Well, then we just gotta go down to Denny's to make sure. I mean, what if they did go? Now we gotta go look for 'em. Baby, where are we gonna go look for 'em? Yeah, all right, baby. Okay. It's all right. I'll go look for 'em. Okay? Don't y'all worry about a thing. I'll see y'all. Leo: You know, Rose's birthday is coming up pretty quick. You know how she loves dogs. I'm gonna call old Harley Fencer and get him to pick her out a real pretty puppy-- something we can make a house dog out of. That'll tickle her, won't it? I'll tell you about it as soon as you wake up. Oh, shit! Leo: You know, I went down to South Arkansas last year. Some old boys down there wanted to go catfish-hogging. They went down to a damn slough, worse than a creek. And they know the logs that's in the damn thing. They get a boat, all of 'em hang their arm in that boat, ease along through that old scummy water-- damn snakes, turtles everywhere. They got up on that damn log and they know every knothole in it, everything about it. One of them guided one end and one of them guided the other, and they got a knothole man there. Mutt Kagle had an army belt in his teeth. Reached inside that damn thing and he tickled that damn catfish, got him started toward the big end. And Mutt Kagle grabbed him right in his damn jaws, like that, and held his ass inside that log. He started dancing. Took that army belt out of his teeth and stuck it in his mouth and back out through his gills, brought it around, put it back through the buckle and tied it around his hand one time. Then he pulled the fish out. We had some sportsmanship then. And a hell of a hurry. You want to go this year? You'll enjoy this when you wake up. Aw, hell, they're long gone. Their cars are in the yard. Well, we gotta find 'em. Hell, honey, they could be anywhere. Please, Ev, now you gotta be with me on this. Now, no-- Daddy is in trouble. Now please go find him. Pick some of the places. Baby, don't worry. Those boys are big enough to take care of themselves. They'll get hungry and come home, sure as the world. - What are you having? - A Bud. You want a mug or a longneck? Pitcher. How many glasses? Miss Pat? I'm gonna give you a piece of advice. I wouldn't serve people don't pay their debts. Bad for business. How many times you want to settle this shit, man? Okay, you cut this shit out or I'll throw your ass outside and call the police. I mean it now. You want to hear something funny? Those two old assholes really did it. They stole a train and headed for Chicago. What? Yeah. Yeah, they even took their shotguns. Bullshit. No, man. No, I'm not shitting you. - Really? - Yeah. Can you see them walking into one of them big old Chicago offices, "Haney and Leo to see Mr. So-and-So." Aw, man! Those two dudes ain't gonna get the time of day! Here you go. ♪ And that's why things go wrong ♪ ♪ And I fall in two ♪ I'm all right ♪ When I'm a-drinking ♪ Till I start to thinking ♪ ♪ 'Bout you... Leo: You think we can find us a greasy spoon here in Flat River? Haney: Maybe we can. I bet you Mr. Thomas Clinton, chairman of the board of Southland, is a good man. Of course we ain't working for him now, but we're going to do something about that, right? You're darn right we are, boss. Where you think we can sleep? Well, I was thinking about that, and I don't know why we don't just crawl up in one of them boxcars. Them hobos do it and they say you can't beat 'em. It's kinda like being outlaws, huh? Out here roughin' it around like Bonnie and Clyde. Leo, who you gonna be? Bonnie or Clyde? You a damn mess, Haney. Take you back to Arkansas. ♪ And that's when things went wrong ♪ ♪ And I got the blues... Haney: You know, Leo, I really ain't looking forward to sleeping in that boxcar. Leo: Can't say I am either. Why don't we take a room? Can we afford it? Well, just the once. Well, let's just get one room. We ain't on vacation, right? Right. Hello there. You want to watch a little TV? All right tonight, boss. It's in color. I know, but I'm just whipped. You don't mind if I watch some, do you? No, sir, you go right ahead. You know, Haney, I been thinking. You know up in Pittsburgh and lots of them steel towns where they've shut down the shops? I was reading in the newspaper where them boys got together and they bought it away from the company. Now they run things themselves. Maybe we could do something like that. Say everybody kick in $5 a man and just take it over. If we all threw in $5 a man, we couldn't raise $600. Yeah. I guess we would be a tad shy, wouldn't we? Charlotte. What the hell you doin'? Ah ah ah! - Damn! - Mama's going to the police. Well, hey, I looked for your daddy, baby. I-- I couldn't find him. - Ain't that right, Alvin? - Shut up, Alvin! I needed you last night, you bastard. - I needed you. - All right, come on, baby. Don't-- don't do that. Oh, boy, here it comes. - Listen, Charlotte-- - Save it, save it. Hey, we're going home. - Okay. Okay. - Move it. Move it. Get out of the car, Alvin. Get out-- - Hey. - Oh! I think we gonna be going now, man. Later. Oh! Okey-dokey. Here you go, ladies. - Jean: Aw, thank you. - Yeah. Sorry I ran out of milk. That's all right. Thanks. We're sorry to get you here so early, Maxie. Oh! Now let's see, what can I do for this little cutie right here? I'm president of the county Razorback Club this year and I get all this stuff to give away. - Oh! - There you go, little britches. - See that? - It's kinda piling up. Look how cute that looks on you. Now I just got one question for y'all. Why in the world would Haney and Leo want to go and steal a train for? Because they flipped their damn lids, that's why. Now, they didn't steal the train. No, they didn't steal a train. Now, ladies, well, I-- I've got very few options as to how to get your menfolk back to you. Oh, well, listen, don't put yourself out. Now, it wasn't that big a thing. Now... in this particular situation, well, I can only think of one legal option. Since they stole a train... Both: They didn't steal a train! I'll put out an APB on 'em for grand theft. Aw, shit. Better back her up. Aw, shit. Haney, I don't think I'll do too well in jail. We ain't gonna go to jail, Leo. - We're gonna go to Chicago! - Leo: Oh, boy! Sir, I think the vehicle is picking up speed. They'll stop. You better slow up. They ain't moving. Aw, they'll move. Is there any seat belts in these things? Sir, I think we'd better move our vehicle before-- They'll stop. - Ha ha! - Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Boy! We showed them. We did that. This old train ain't dead yet, Leo. Just wait till we get a hold of Mr. Thomas Clinton. Haney, you think they'll make us pay for that police car? Man: There's a new flag flying over Southland. It reads: Air Freight. We're moving out of the past and into the future. Hey, Southland, America thinks you're okay! Well, this is-- it's awful, Les. I mean, this is-- it's terrible. Who else has seen this? - Mr. Gerber, you see-- - I thought you guys understood what we wanted. I mean, right now Southland has a bad public image because of all the people we laid off. We want to have a good public-- this commercial gives us a bad public image. Woman: Mr. Gerber? No calls, Sharon. It's your daughter. All right, put her on. Hi, sweetie! Yeah, what is it? Honey, Daddy is very busy right now. Uh-huh, well, go show Mommy. I love you, pumpkin. Yes, bye-bye, sweetie. Les, if you guys can't give us what we want, we will find someone else who can. I want to get this company off on the right foot. This is my company. This is my idea. I don't want anything to screw this up. Right now the old man doesn't know anything about this. So when he does finally figure out what's happening, - I want everything to be in its place-- - --and operating smoothly. - Mr. Gerber? Sharon, no calls. Sorry, Mr. Gerber, but there's a policeman on the phone. He says one of our trains has been stolen by two men who lost their jobs. He says they're heading for Chicago. Well, you see, Les? This is exactly what I'm talking about. This is incredibly bad P.R. Put him on. I just hope to God they haven't taken any hostages. Oh, Jesus. We gotta be getting close to St. Louis. Yeah, they're going to be waiting on us, ain't they? Haney: Well, what do you think, boss? - Turn it around? - Leo: Yeah, I guess. Damn, I hate to think we didn't get to talk to Mr. Thomas Clinton, chairman of the board for Southland. We could've changed his mind, that's for sure. You're damn right we could have. You thinking what I'm thinking? Yeah. How many police you think we'll have to cut through? Officer, I want those tracks clear and open for that train all the way to Chicago. No problem. I'll take full responsibility for that police car. Bye-bye. Why did you tell the police to let them go? That was a mistake. Because Southland does not forget its own. And because it's damn good P.R. Haney: This is damn foolishness. We ain't breaking no law. We run these trains every day. They're just as much ours as Southland's. Leo: Let's do it. We ain't got a damn thing to lose. It can't get no worse. What the hell have we accomplished, Leo? I can't say. Jesus Christ, we're sitting out here in the middle of nowhere, we got nothing to eat, the laws are after us. And our train's out of gas. I don't guess we've accomplished much. I would say not. Looks like we've hit the end of the line. No, sir. The end of the line is jail. We're in a hell of a mess. I used to think the railroad was probably the best thing a man could do for himself. Back when we started, it was. I always figured as long as there was a United damn States of America, there'd be a railroad in Arkansas a man could work on. Haney, you remember that time that me and you and all the boys took a picture out in front of that old steam engine? I do. Everybody said back then that that was the death of the railroad, 'cause we switched over to diesel. Might have been. You reckon they're trying to kill us off like them old steamers? They may be, Leo. They just might be. ♪ One more shot for old times ♪ ♪ One last stand ♪ One more hit ought to do it ♪ ♪ Then we'll quit while we can. ♪ You know, all of my life, I set around and I let somebody else decide things for me. Well, I'll tell you something, old friend. Ain't no son of a bitch gonna decide when or how I die. And I ain't gonna die in no jail cell. What about Jean and the babies? I'm no good to them now. They need a man with a job, see? They don't need no convict. Well, Rose ain't gonna wait for me to get out of jail. She's a free spirit. You sure this is the right way to go? Be an accomplishment. It'd be our own decision. You sure we don't want to sleep on this? I don't think sleep would change a thing. Do you? I reckon not. All right. Stand right over there. Right there. I'll be down here. Now on the count of three, we'll just blow our damn heads off. All right. One... A man works his whole life, Leo, and they turn their back on him. Two! I hope the good Lord's gonna let us in heaven, Haney. Aw, I bet He will. We've been hard workers all our life. And we got a lot of people who loves us. Jeannie thinks I'm the picture on every dollar. - Let's don't do it, Leo. - Three! Well, what the hell are you doing?! I shot just like you said. - But you missed. - But you didn't even shoot. If I had, I'd have hit you. That would've done it! And then I wouldn't only go to jail for stealing that train, they'd throw in murder to boot! Well, at least you'd be alive. I'd be dead. What the hell you doin', Haney? You gone nuts? What do you want to do about gas? 'Morning. 'Morning. You do have diesel fuel? We got anything you need. Leo: Well, that's good, ain't it? Well, what do you need? We need about 500 gallons of your diesel. 500 gallons? I tell you, we sure do appreciate this! Boy: Well, this is great. Somebody will probably write a book about you guys someday. A book about us, Haney! Rose would get a kick out of that. Haney: I don't think it'll ever make the best-seller list. Well, I'd buy a copy. Outlaws. God damn! Haney: Maybe them St. Louis police ain't looking for us after all. Leo: Maybe. St. Louis is a town I always wanted to visit, Leo. Maybe I'll come back here one of these days. I'd like to bring Rose up here and show her that brewery they got. That'd be real nice. There's something on the track up ahead. - Where? - Right there! Shut her down! Hold it! Hold! Hey, Old Crow in a bottle, Prince Albert in a can. Let 'em out! I think I told you one time not to lay out on these damn railroad tracks. Now we very near cut you in half. Hey, I know you. You took my bottle. Are you still trying to get to Chicago? - Oh, yeah. - Well, sir, you're in luck. We're going to take you. - Are you? - Yes, sir. For once, my horoscope was correct. Haney: My, Landon, in your life did you ever see such a sight? Leo: How in the world do they take care of all of it? Well, they just got to have a lot of boys to help them, wouldn't you think? I guess so. I want the cops into your vehicles, please. Right away. And photographers assemble, please. - Warren! Warren! Warren! - Right away, photographers. Warren, they're here. I saw them from the tower. They're here. All right, all right, let me see those lights. Police-- very nice. Band, assemble right away. Let's do it. Lively, band! I want to see a lot of pep. You're looking a little still. Well, old horse, you see them lights, don't you? I see 'em. I reckon we're home. Maybe we can turn it around and back out of here. I don't think so. Looks to me like they want us to come on in. Well, Rose is gonna find out about this, and I sure dread it. My God, they're coming. Louder! Louder, band! Full expression, please. Do I look all right, Les? Oh, Warren, you look fine. I want to use this footage in the commercial. Don't worry, you look terrific. Oh, there they are. Right there, right there. - I see them. - Ha ha! This is terrific. John Johnson live... Nice. Very good, band. Chicago! I love this crazy town. No pictures. No, no, there'll be other photo opportunities later. That was a close one. I guess we pulled a fast one, huh? Think we should have brought our shotguns? No, sir, I don't believe we need 'em. We're away from the train now and on the street. We look just like everybody else. You know, I ain't never seen the ocean, but I bet it don't look a hell of a lot different than this right here. Rose saw a gulf one time down in Mississippi. She said that was a real pretty sight. You want to hear something funny? I ain't never even been to Mississippi. We don't get out often, do we? That's it, ain't it? Yes, sir. Pretty big. Aw, shit, it ain't that big. It's just a building. You take the shine off of it and boil all the bullshit down, the fellas in there running that ain't no different than us. I bet we could do it just as good as they are. We sure could. It's just a damn shame we couldn't open up our own little shop back in Clifford. I know we could handle that. We been handling that all along, Leo. Shit, I'm glad we came, ain't you? You mighty right. We gonna get them jobs back for everybody too. God Almighty, do you know it's after 11:00 o'clock? We gotta find us a place to stay. Ladies? Can I get some ladies for you? - Do you need some ladies? - Hey, mister. Haney: I bet we can afford that one. Man, I hope so. Pimp: Ladies. Can I get some ladies for you? Do you need some ladies? Give us a double room. Sure feels good to lay down. It sure does. There, Mr. Thomas Clinton. I'm ready for you. Hey, Haney? Hold this just a second. You look sharp. Hello there. Oh, how can I help you? Well, you could direct us to the offices of Mr. Thomas G. Clinton. I don't suppose you gentlemen have an appointment? No, sir, we don't have an appointment. We've come a long way and we sure would like to see Mr. Clinton. Chairman of the board for Southland Railroad. Look, guys, if you don't have an appointment with anyone, I'm going to have to ask you to leave the premises. You don't seem to understand, sir. We've come a long way. We've come all the way from Arkansas and we aim to see Mr. Clinton. Are you the guys from Arkansas? We're from Arkansas. But are you the railroad guys from Arkansas? Hey, hey, wait a minute, fellas! Wait, wait! Hang on! It's right this way, gentlemen. These are the guys from Arkansas. I found 'em. Leo: We're from Arkansas. - Mr. Gerber, they're here. - Who's here? The men from Arkansas. They're here. Gerber: They're here?! Tell him security guard Travers found them. Gentlemen. Oh, gentlemen! Warren Gerber, president of Southland. - How do you do, sir? - Oh, this is-- 'Morning. Well, please, will you come right this way? Oh, it is so nice to see you. We'll have a seat. We'll rest your feet for a moment. I found 'em, Mr. Gerber. Travers-- security! See, over here-- Uh, Travers. Herbert Travers. Come in! Come in, please. Southland and I welcome you and have a seat, please. Won't you both have a seat? Now, I set up a little reception committee for you yesterday, Mr. Haney? - That's me. - And you must be Leo. - I'm Leo. - But somehow we missed you. Now I understand that you want to talk to me about something. To tell you the truth, Mr. Gerber, we come to speak with Thomas Clinton, the chairman of the board of Southland Railroad. No, you want to speak to me. I'm the president. Well, if you're the head man, we have a couple things we need to discuss. And so we shall, Mr. Haney. So-- I'm just so excited that you're here. I want you to know that Southland thinks you men are heroes. And that is a very, very rare thing in this country today. You gentlemen are a credit to the country, to this company. I really mean this. I mean, Southland was built by men like you. You are real men-- American men. These men set out on a mission to save their little town. They set out in a locomotive, just the two of them, against all odds, to challenge what they believe to be a large, impersonal company. And here they are. But, Mr. Haney... - and Leo-- - Leo Pickett. - --you're-- - Clifford, Arkansas, local. Mr. Leo Pickett! You were wrong. We're not impersonal. Southland does not forget its own. Welcome to our lovely city from so far away. Let's have a famous Arkansas smile. Looks like Mr. Pickett's having a good time there. I think they're very happy. I think it's going very nicely. I like the check, but the printing isn't big enough. Old Gerber ain't too bad a fella after all, huh? Man: In the past, when America was young, we used these men to move freight-- Southland engineers. Today, stepping into the future, we use these men and women-- Southland pilots. And here's the man responsible. Hi. I'm Warren Gerber. I'm president of Southland. We're moving into the future. Once engineers carried freight by rail. Now pilots move it by air. Les: Cut, cut, cut! Cut! - Cut, cut, cut, cut! - What is this? - I'm sorry, Mr. Gerber. - What's going on here, Les? Mr. Haney, you're not wearing your cap. That's right. I ain't gonna wear that cap. Well, you see, Mr. Haney, the gist-- the gist of this campaign is that Southland used to depend on quality engineers to move freight. But you see, now we're using pilots. You see, in this commercial, we have to see you, the engineer, passing the gauntlet on to the pilot. - To Leo. - I ain't an engineer. You know, Vernon Tarver's the engineer-- good one too. No, no. See, you're just pretending to be an engineer. You don't really actually have to be an engineer. Oh, I understand what you're saying, fellas. You want me to say that I'm an engineer and tell everybody that I'm an engineer. Well, I ain't. I'm a brakeman. Well, you see, sir, pilots and engineers are-- are parallel. Brakeman wouldn't work. I mean, what the hell is a brakeman? Do you know that you actually drove a train up here? So it's not stretching the truth to call yourself an engineer. It's a goddamn lie. I think you fellas ought to go get ya an actor that does this all the time. And I think you and me ought to have that little talk we come up here to have. - Good. - Now! Okay, fine, very good. Let's have a little break, Les. I think we're all getting a little bit tired right now. So we'll just take a very little break. Okay, five minutes, everybody. Five minutes. I'll be right back. Les, what is the-- - Call the studio and book more time. - Okay. What do you say, Mr. Engineer? I don't like the way this is going, Leo. I didn't come up here to make no television commercial and neither did you. No, sir. We come up to see Thomas Clinton about getting them jobs back. And we ain't seen him. I don't feel much like a hero, Leo. Haney? Let's take the stairs. How far up? Well, ordinarily, the head man is clear to the top. Has anyone checked the ladies' room? - I checked. - Warren, they're not here. Ooh, ooh! Call security down at Southland. Have somebody check at the rail yard. I want those two found and brought back immediately. Get out of here! Move! How's your ticker? She's wound out. How you holding up, partner? Well, I'm still breathing. Now listen, if I was to blow a gasket here, you keep going. One of us has got to get to this Clinton fella. Now don't talk like that, Haney. We can make a couple stairs. Security. Travers. - This is Warren Gerber, president of Southland. - Yes, sir. Have you seen those two strange railroad men from Arkansas? Uh, no, sir. But if they come through this way, I'll see 'em. You make sure you do or don't bother reporting to work tomorrow. - You got it? - I'm on the job, sir. I'm right here. Haney: You know, if I was to fall over dead here in Chicago, old Jean would be so goddamn mad, she wouldn't even come after me. She'd just tell 'em, "Put the old fool in a cardboard box and roll him in a ditch." Leo: Aw, she wouldn't do no such thing. But if she did, I'd make sure you got a proper burial. Thank you. Thank you a lot. Ma'am, we come here to see Thomas Clinton. We got no appointment. But we come a long ways to see him, to speak our mind. Now we need five minutes of his time, and by hell, we aim to get it. And please excuse my language. Woman: Mr. Clinton? Mr. Haney and Mr. Pickett are here to see you. He doesn't hear too well anymore. You'll have to speak loudly. - Mr. Clinton? - Oh, come on in. Come on in. Mr. Haney and Mr. Pickett are here to see you. Well, get yourself some-- a couple of cigars off my desk there. They're real Cuban cigars. You should have one. Thank you, sir, but I don't smoke. No, thank you. Well, that's a damn shame. They're hand-rolled. Now you don't have to shout. I'm not as deaf as she thinks I am. - I'm Tom Clinton. - Will Haney. - Hi. - Pleased to meet you, sir. I don't know what's wrong with this thing. This boxcar-- it won't-- it won't stay on the track. Do you mind if I have a look at it? Sure, help yourself. Oh, yeah. These front wheels have spread out and they're wider than the back ones. And that's why they keep going off the track on you. Not much. Here, try that, sir. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I need some glasses. You know your way around a boxcar, don't you? Some. You railroad men? Uh, yes, sir. You work for me? Yes, sir. What do you do? - Well, I'm a brakeman. - I knock cars. Oh, well, those are two fine jobs. Have a seat. Have a seat. I knocked cars myself a long, long time ago. Now, what can I do for you, boys? Well, sir, we've come a long way to talk to you. We've got to try and change your mind. Change my mind? Yes, sir, about your shutting down the railroad. Gentlemen, what the hell are you talking about? Mr. Clinton, we come up here to try and save our jobs. The railroad is closed? Yes, sir. Say, what the hell kind of a chairman of the board are you? They close your goddamn railroad down and you don't know nothin' about it? Fellas, I got to tell you how it is. I'm the chairman of the board of this company, but that's about it. My son-in-law, Warren... Warren Gerber. Gerber! He actually runs it. He's the president. Hell, I just sit up here in this office and I work my train set. Keeps me occupied. My wife died... a few years ago. I'm sorry. Sorry to hear that. At any rate, I haven't kept up with company operations for quite some time now. Sharon, have we heard from security? No, sir. Wait a minute! I know where they are. Les, I bet half your salary. Where's my mind? I'm sure Warren had good reason for closing the railroad down. You know, he's-- he's made more money for this company than I ever did when I was running the show. And he's a damn good businessman. And he's a member of the family. So I have to respect his decisions. But I would like to help you boys if I could. Mr. Clinton? That little shop in Clifford, Arkansas, means our lives. It's all we got, sir. We come here to get it back. And we don't know a doggone thing about the air freight business. What did you say? I said we don't know a dadgum thing about the air freight business. Southland... is going into air freight? - Yes, sir. - That little son of a bitch. He knows how I feel about airplanes. I hate the sons of bitches, always have. The day the airplanes went into commercial business, I knew right then it was the disease that would kill the great railroads! I gave the little son of a bitch this company when he married my daughter. Now he's going to throw it back in my face. See there, Haney, everybody's got son-in-law problems. It's the same all over. He was going to slip this transaction by me to show that this is his company now. I wanna tell you something, Mr. Clinton. I don't really give a good goddamn about your family squabbles. Hell, we all have that. But yours cost our jobs. And we do have a plan if you're interested. Fellas, I'm damn interested. Lucy, these gentlemen are kidnapping me. Don't call the police. Just tell Warren what's happened. Mr. Clinton?! Hey, taxi! - Mr. Gerber! Gerber, there they are-- right there! - Shit! Shit! This is a nightmare. - Southland air freight is going to be a joke! - Les: Stop! Don't let anybody find out about this. You think they'll go back to Kansas? Arkansas, Les-- Arkansas. Hey, I've got a baby on board! Can't you drive any faster? We can walk faster than this. That's a good idea. - Where's the other one? I need the other one. - You've got mine. We get down to Arkansas, Tom, you ain't never gonna want to leave. Best hunting, fishing in the world. Ain't it, Haney? - Yes, sir. It is for a fact, boss. I can't-- where's the thing? Say, what in the world would that be? Why, fellas, that's a sculpture by Pablo Picasso. - Huh. - Yeah, imagine that. No, this isn't-- - You all right? - This is terrible. This is terrible. - Thomas: Hey, this is great! - Yes, sir. Haney: You ever drive one of these things? Thomas: No. You want to try it? You think I could? I'll get around this bend, get this track straightened out, and we'll have you drive for a little. Good. There's your directional indicator. Of course, we're going forward and you won't have to change that. There's your throttle. Yeah, pull back when you want to go faster. That's right, and push it forward when you want to go slower. And there's-- there's your indicator that tells you how much fuel you're feeding your engine. And here, of course, your ground speed up here. And right here, that's the brake. - Brake. Forward to stop. - Yes, sir. - That's right. - Yes, just a touch. Now watch, we'll slow down. Watch. See, put a little air on her. - See, feel her slow down? - Yeah. Like a big Buick Roadmaster, Tom. Now we'll get our ground speed down to a reasonable area here, and then I'll just turn her over to you, Tom. - Okay, okay! - Of course, if you're gonna drive it, here, you'd better have this official... railroad engineer's hat. Son of a gun, look at that. Okay. - That all right? - Yes, sir. Now you won't have to change anything. Just sit here and drive your own train, sir. - Brake... - Yes, sir. Yeah. - Now... - Can I speed-- can I speed it up a little bit? Well, I wouldn't. You see, we're going around a pretty good bend here. I'd just kind of hold her where she is and-- I got it. Ha ha ha! Don't even have to guide it, do you? No, no, them tracks do that. See, they're-- they hold it in a straight line. Well, you're kind of a natural. Yeah, I think so. I was in the shower the other day, trying to remember the Pledge of Allegiance. You know, the American one? And I couldn't remember it. I couldn't remember half of it. "I pledge allegiance to these United States of America..." "To the republic..." - "...to the republic..." - "...for which it stands..." "...for which she stands." Yes, sir. "With liberty and justice for all." Well, you got a little ahead of yourself there. Which one is that? - "One nation..." - "One nation..." God bless America, for which she stands! "Under God!" ♪ We got banjoes walking in the night ♪ ♪ And the prettiest women in the world ♪ ♪ We've got the best of the human race ♪ ♪ Got every blue boy and girl ♪ ♪ I tell you that God Both: ♪ Must have blessed America ♪ For us to have so many, many things ♪ ♪ We've got each and every kind ♪ ♪ All together at one time ♪ ♪ You know, God, he must have blessed us all. ♪ Getting close now. I can tell about where we are. Gonna come across a slough around here a little ways that's just chock-full of moccasins and snapping turtles. Yeah. What happened to Leo? Look at him yonder. Oh, he's sound asleep. He could sleep anywhere. He can smell his home country, see? And he dreamed he died and went to heaven. Last stop! End of the line! Come on, old horse, wake up! Boy, Haney, you know how it feels when you've been away from home a long time, can't wait to get back? I can't hardly feel it at all. Come on, make a move. Let's go. Hey, fellas, looky here. Thomas: Well, there he is-- the sky king! Haney? Leo? Don't make me shoot you down in front of your loved ones. I don't want a riot on my hands. So you just drop them guns, put your hands on your head. Lord, Maxie, these guns is empty. We ran out of shells a long time ago. And we're putting 'em down. I'd like to have a word with you. You boys come on up here. Let's talk about this. Come on. Take it easy. Take it slow. That's it. That's it. You don't recognize us? I recognize you. I recognize you real well. So how was your trip? It was just fine. You ought to go up there with us next time. Sheriff, I want you to arrest these men. Haney, Leo, y'all are under arrest. - For what? - What for? I'll tell you what for. Grand theft of a Southland engine, possession of stolen property, destruction of Southland property, and if that doesn't put you away for the rest of your lives, there's the little matter of kidnapping a Southland executive. Haney: Say, come back here, sir. Please, Mr. Gerber? Come back here. You know, if you're going to make accusations at me, you ought to have the decency to stand there while I answer them. Now, I never stole a goddamn thing-- not since I was a little boy. We did borrow that engine, Maxie. But we give it back to Tom here, and he owned it all the time. Now for the kidnapping-- you help me through this, Maxie, 'cause I ain't a lawyer. But I think to kidnap somebody, you gotta take 'em away somewhere against their will. - Don't you? - Sure. Well, see, we ain't done that. Have we, Tom? Warren: Of course you did. Ha! Mr. Gerber, I can't see where these men have broken the law. I'd be hard-pressed to arrest them. Well, it's illegal to trespass, isn't it? This place is illegal to enter for Southland employees! I want you to arrest these people for trespassing. - Arrest them! - Eh, you got me there, Haney. There is a law against trespassing. Good. Then lock him up. What? I own the ground you're standing on, feller. And I own that shop. So you see, hotshot, you're trespassing. Oh, you-- This property would cost hundreds of thousands of doll-- Man: Go home, Mr. Southland! I'm sorry, you could not afford this. I guess maybe I got a hell of a deal, then. 'Cause I bought the whole shiteree from Tom here for $1. Please shut up. You know something, Mr. Gerber? All of my life I've stood back and let office pinkies like you make decisions for me. Well, big boy, you ain't making this one. I bought this shop, I'm gonna keep it open, and I'm gonna do my goddamnedest to run it. Gentlemen, I think you've missed the point. You should have kept the cars and the checks. I mean, it would have been a lot easier for you. You're pushing this thing very far. And if I wanted to pursue this thing legally, I could just drag your asses through the court for years and you would still never own this place. But that's-- that's not the point. I mean, well, the point is that you can just have this shop. I mean, I'll give you your dollar back. But that's also not the point. I mean, what I'm-- what I'm trying to say is... this shop is dead. This town is dead. It will never be the same. That is why I got out. So, Mr. Haney, you can turn this into an independent rail yard if you want to. But you are just going to be wasting your time. Sheriff, I'm dropping all charges. Now you think about this, Mr. Haney. It's up to you. Let's go, Dad. Thomas: Not on your damn airplane, Warren! All right, have it your way. Haney, what the hell happened? What about our jobs? Huh? Well, we got two choices. We own this place now, lock, stock and barrel. We can either stay here and try to make a go of it or go off somewhere else and try it again. No guarantees either way. I know what I'm gonna do. I'm staying. Right now I'm going to take my family and go home. Come on, son. Good to have you back, Daddy. Come on, Jean. Up you go. You can come if you like. Man: Way to do it, Haney! All hail the conquering hero! Boys, you did it. You're in control now. By golly, I guess so. Was it all worth it? I think so too! That's a good one. Here you go, Daddy. - Thanks, honey. - Daddy, Ev wants to ask you something. Go ahead. I want to marry Charlotte again. Ask him. Can I marry Charlotte again? Look at the ring, Daddy. Daddy? That's the very same ring you had last time. It is. But he had it cleaned. All right. But if you hurt her, or if you sadden her one more time, I'll find you, young man, and I'll beat you till your head's soft and mushy. Everett: Come on, let's go. Let's go. You sure look good in uniform. Chicago turned me into a clotheshorse. How's my dogs? Well, it's a pretty interesting world out there, but we don't have it too bad right here. Does this mean we're not going to get that camper? Grandpa, look what Aunt Rose found. What have you got there, Short Round? Haney, where'd you get that old thing? I never saw that before. Aw, well, that's been hanging on the wall for years. They don't make 'em like that anymore, do they, Haney? That's a fact, boss. That's a fact.
