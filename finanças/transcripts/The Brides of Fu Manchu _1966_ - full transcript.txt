(WIND HOWLING) They must not get away. If necessary, shoot to kill. Yes, sir. Right! Has something gone wrong, Father? Why did Nayland Smith leave the seeds here? FU MANCHU: The world shall hear from me again! Michèle! Father! Let him rise. Why am I here? Who are you? - I am Fu Manchu. - Fu Manchu? It isn't possible. You died. Untie the girl. Monsieur Merlin! You and your daughter have been brought here because I require your assistance. You can go to hell. - Has she been... prepared? - Yes, Father. Proceed. LIN TANG: Now you have no will. No desires, but to please your masters. You will obey only those orders we give you. MICHÈLE: Yes. Take this knife, and place it at the throat of the man who is your father. Michèle! Shall she kill him, Father? You dare not, if you need my help. Raise the trap door. Tie Shiva to it. (WHIRRING) LIN TANG: Stop. Ropes will not be necessary. Shiva is the daughter of a man skilled in electromagnetic research. Dr Ramchand. - Dr Ramchand? But he is... - Dead. I found I couldn't trust him. Now I have no further use for his daughter. You murderer! One slash of the knife, and she will join her father. - And your daughter has the knife. - She won't do it. Even under hypnosis, you can't make her do something against her character. FU MANCHU: Michèle. Cut her free. - (SHIVA SCREAMING) - MERLIN: Michèle! Michèle! Stop! Stop! - (SCREAMING) - MERLIN: Stop! It's me, your father! - (PROLONGED SCREAMING) - MERLIN: Stop! (SCREAMING CONTINUES) - (TRAP DOOR CLUNKING) - (SCREAMING STOPS) Did I do well? I'll kill you! - I swear I'll kill you! - You will do exactly as I say. Or do you wish me to bring your daughter out of her trance, and tell her what she has just done? It might be interesting to watch how such a young and innocent mind would accept such knowledge. (SOBBING) What do I have to do? (BARREL ORGAN PLAYING) - Well, I'm baffled, Petrie. - Hmm? It seems so senseless. Why go to all the trouble of kidnapping these women if you're not going to demand a ransom? They're all very beautiful women. White slave traffic? Oh, no, they always go for unknowns. These are all wives and daughters of leading industrialists and scientists. Probably some crank, then. Someone with a grudge. No, it's too efficient for that. They've kidnapped eleven women in eighteen months in ten different countries, Petrie. And that means a big organisation. Well, there's one comfort. There's been no kidnapping here so we don't have to worry about it. Not officially, no. Sergeant Spicer, please. Ah, Sergeant, Nayland Smith here. I want you to get me every scrap of information you can on these international kidnappings. Oh, no, no. Not just the Merlin girl. I want you to go back to the very first one in Shanghai. Now, get on to each country and see if they'll let me have duplicates of their dossiers. Well, cable them and ask them to send it airmail. It's urgent. What are you up to? I'm studying the enemy, Petrie. The more we can find out about them, the more chance we have of catching 'em next time. Next time? Well, we've no reason to suppose they won't do it again. No, there's no reason to suppose it'll be here in England either. I find myself almost wishing they would try it here. (MACHINERY RUMBLING) As I told you, generating the energy was simple. Our triumph was in transmitting this energy as sound waves. (ELECTRONIC HUM) FU MANCHU: From here, we can communicate with any major city in the world. Monsieur Merlin, look at this. This is the model of the transmission aerial that the late Dr Ramchand designed for us. - And that is the receiving end? - Yes. That aerial captures the signal, and passes it to... What shall we call it? The wireless set? The set, what does it do? The same job as a wireless set. Turns the signal back into its original form. In our case, energy. This is fantastic. Wonderful! Heat, light, power, transmitted anywhere in a matter of seconds. What do you use it for? Bombs and shells create such a small release of energy. - But this power... - It is enough to destroy a city. Your task is simple, Monsieur Merlin. At present, an explosion big enough to destroy a ten-storey building requires a set twice the size of this table here. That is inconvenient. The sets must be smaller. I can't do that. No-one can make even a small wireless set. They have to be big. On October 17th, you carried out a test for the Paris police in a field ten miles from the city. A motorcyclist wore a small receiver strapped to his chest, and was able to hear clearly a message sent out from his headquarters. That was only experimental. You said at the time: "It will soon be possible for cars and motorcycles" "to receive instructions, and to reply to their headquarters," "with the aid of a small handset." Remember, the snake pit is one of the quicker deaths that awaits your daughter. (BELL TOLLING) (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) (GROANING) (GROANING) (BOAT ENGINE STARTING) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) - MAN: What's been going on here, sir? - We were attacked. Will you give me a hand with this young lady? Attacked? Who by? I don't know. From that launch. (SEAGULLS CRYING) But they were here. One of them is still unconscious. Over there. POLICEMAN: One moment, sir. You're not going anywhere. This man is dead. (POLICE WHISTLE BLOWING) Look at this. Tibetan prayer scarf. - Where did you get it? - From the body of a dacoit. He was killed down near Tower Bridge last night. Look at that. SMITH: One of Fu Manchu's men. Obviously left behind when he pulled out of here and went to Tibet. He wasn't left behind. I examined that body very thoroughly. That man had been in a tropical country until quite recently. He couldn't have been in London more than a month. What about his clothes? The black tunic? Almost new. Tell me more, Petrie. How was he killed? A blow on the skull, but the man who did it claims it was an accident. Anyway, he's being held at Bow Street. - Who's he? - I... I'm sorry. Only it seems as though all this has happened before. It's uncanny. - What do you mean, Petrie? - He's a research chemist. A young German, just like last time. - He's in here, sir. - SMITH: Thank you. - Franz Baumer? - Yes. I'm from Scotland Yard. Assistant Commissioner Nayland Smith. This is Dr Petrie, Home Office pathologist. Look, I have already told the police everything I know. How much longer am I to be kept here? I've read your statement. Have you any idea why you were attacked? No. None at all. There was no attempt to rob you? BAUMER: They wouldn't have got much. No, no, it wasn't just robbery. Why do you say that? BAUMER: Why would they have the launch there? Huh? Why do you think the launch was there? Well, I had a feeling they were trying to get Marie, Miss Lentz, onto the launch. The girl? You're quite sure it wasn't you they were after? Me? What for? - Lentz? - Yes. Who is she, Baumer? - The girl I want to marry. - I mean her family. Well, her mother's French, and, er... her father is Otto Lentz. What, the man who sorted out that hydro-electric disaster in Switzerland? That's him. - Do you know where he is? - What? Oh, er... Germany, I suppose. And the girl? Is she just visiting here? No, no, she's on the staff of St Edmund's Hospital. Do you think it is Fu Manchu? Can he still be alive? I don't know, Petrie. The important thing is to be in time to save that girl. Save her? Well, if Baumer's right and it is the girl they're after, they'll try again, and they'll do it quickly, before anyone can suspect the truth. (PHONE RINGING) Casualty. What? No. No-one here at all. Nurse Lentz? Oh, yes, she's here. Just a moment. Hello? Hello. (DIALLING TONE) It's dead. Oh, cut off on the switchboard again, I expect. They'll ring back later. (AMBULANCE BELL RINGING) No rest for the wicked. - Send them into Room 3, will you? - Right. Number 3, mates. Here, where's the card? (GASPING) What's the matter with him? (SCREAMING) Can you tell me where the porter is? Nurse Lentz! (MUFFLED CRIES) MAN: What's happening? Who are you? Police. Quick, after those men. - (VEHICLE DRIVING AWAY) - (AMBULANCE BELL RINGING) - You all right, Petrie? - Yes, yes. Now, who are you? Nikki Sheldon. I'm a friend of Miss Lentz. What's happened to her? An attempt has been made to kidnap her. I'd have caught them if I hadn't been attacked. I'm sorry, but two men had already attacked me in the corridor. When you came through that door, I thought I'd better get in first. Hmm. How is she? They tried to chloroform her, but she hasn't taken much. She'll come round in about ten minutes. It was Baumer's idea, this walk by the river? Yes... - But you can't think that he... - Marie, you've got to realise he can't be trusted. You know what your father thinks about him. I don't care what Daddy or anyone thinks. I know Franz. Miss Lentz, can you tell me where I can get in touch with your father? He's in Germany at present. Düsseldorf, isn't he? Yes. Why do you want to talk to him? Because I'm putting a police guard on you. (CHUCKLING) But that's silly. It's a bit overdramatic, isn't it, Commissioner? I don't think so, Mr Sheldon. Now, Miss Lentz. I want you to promise me that you will not set foot outside the hospital, for any reason whatsoever. I feel scared, Nikki. Why should anyone want to kidnap me? I don't know the exact reason. Not yet. But I believe that the man behind it is the most evil and ruthless man in the world. If you are necessary to his plans, he won't rest till he gets you. Nayland Smith. So, once again, our paths cross. What instructions shall I send to London? Tell them to do nothing until you arrive. When do I leave? Tomorrow. And this time, there will be no mistake. And, Daughter... Merlin is ready to return to Paris. He will go with you. (CHATTERING) MICHÈLE: Father! Michèle. (MICHÈLE SOBBING) Michèle, I have only a few minutes before I have to leave for Paris. - Am I coming? Are we free? - No, no, not yet. Er... there is some work I have to do in Paris first. Then I will be back, in a week or two. What is this work? What is he making you do? (WHISPERING) Tell me, have any of the girls any idea where we are? No, except that this whole place is all underground. - What do you know? - I don't know anything. I was brought here as a prisoner, blindfold. I didn't see anything. One of the girls is from Turkey, and she knows something of archaeology. - And she says... - ABDUL: Hey, you! You must not do that. She gave you something. It is forbidden. - What are you talking about? - Silence! I saw her. I'll search you. (WHISPERING) Now, listen carefully. - You're in the Temple of Karna. - What? ABDUL: (LOUDLY) It's in your hands. Show me your hands. (WHISPERING) Let me see. Now, do you understand? Temple of Karna. Karna. He has nothing. - Who is he? - The girls call him Abdul. He's the only one we can trust. It is time to leave. Michèle... She does not even see you when I am here. Come. - Well, Spicer, what have you found? - Not much, sir, but something. Two weeks after the first girl disappeared... - Er... from Shanghai, you remember? - Mmm. Her husband took a holiday in Athens. He was away for about three weeks. The same sort of thing happened in all the other cases. Within a week or two, the husband or the father took a holiday. One went to Casablanca, one to Gibraltar, two to Algiers, one to Sardinia, two to Naples, one to Malta, two to Tripoli. You can add another one to Naples. Merlin went there, too. Why? What does it mean? It means, Petrie, that somewhere in this area is Fu Manchu's new headquarters. Look at all these towns. All along the coast. Perfectly easy to smuggle a man out. You think they've taken them from these towns to his headquarters, sir? Yes, I do. Well, we can't search half the Mediterranean looking for him. LENTZ: Marie! Oh, Daddy has just come in. I must leave, darling. Phone me later, will you? In an hour or so. My dear. - Well, at least you look all right. - I am all right. That was Franz on the phone. They have released him. I'd have expected the police to show more sense than that. Oh, Daddy, you are so wrong about Franz. - Can I leave you here with Marie now, sir? - Yes, thank you, Nikki. - Are you leaving, Nikki? - I must. I have an appointment in Paris tomorrow. There's just time to catch the night ferry. (BELL TOLLING) That's all, Louise. There are a lot of messages here for you, monsieur. And people wanting to see you urgently. Well, they'll have to wait. I don't want to see anyone. Nikki! Oh! Why didn't you warn me you were coming over? - Look at me! - You look wonderful. As always. - Is he in? - Yes, but he doesn't want to see anyone. This is different. Good morning! Welcome back. All right, Louise. You haven't wasted any time. There is no time to waste. Now that you are becoming a member of Wireless International, we have to erect an aerial for you. - You saw the model? - Yes. These are the plans for the tower. The rest of the equipment will arrive from... other of our members. - Is that all? - No. It has been decided that you'll have the first two small sets completed in five days. - That is ridiculous. - Nevertheless, they will be ready, and you'll bring them to London with you on the sixth day. I will look at the factory and choose the site for the aerial. (TYPEWRITER CLACKING) I'm sorry, will you be staying long, sir? - Ola, what are you doing here? - Cleaning. Clean...? Good heavens, is that the time? (SIGHING) Ah. Hello? Casualty, please. Hello? Nurse Lentz, please. Changed her duty? Oh. Well, er... put me through to the nurses' home, will you? Thank you. (CHATTERING) (ORCHESTRA TUNING UP) This was a good idea, Nikki. Not scared of bogeymen, or the yellow peril? (CHUCKLING) Not anymore. I wonder why the police decided to take away the guard. Who knows? Programme? (INAUDIBLE WHISPERING) (INAUDIBLE) When did the police tell her this? Huh. And she went straight out to the theatre? Yes. Yes. Thank you very much. She left this for you. She said she was expecting you to call her. Yes. Yes, I know. "Dear Franz, isn't it marvellous I'm allowed out?" "The police phoned to say they've taken the guard away." "I tried to phone you. Now, Nikki's here," "and has got seats for the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith." "So I will phone you tomorrow. Love, Marie." - She left with Mr Sheldon? - Yes. - He'd better take care of her. - Thank you, Nurse. - Well? - They've found a constable. He was strangled. (BALLET MUSIC PLAYING) (WHISPERING) Franz, you go up there. - Stay here, will you, Petrie? - Mm-hmm. (LOUD KNOCKING) (AUDIENCE MUTTERING) MAN: The fire curtain's down! (AUDIENCE EXPRESSING ALARM) (MARIE SCREAMING) What happened? Don't worry about me. They've got the girl. (PHONE RINGING) Hello, Sir Dennis Nayland Smith's residence. No, I'm sorry, he isn't here. No, Inspector, he didn't say. Oh, just a minute. He's coming in now. - Inspector Grimaldi, sir, from Paris. - Ah. Thank you, Lotus. Hello, Pierre. Hello, my friends. How is your lovely prisoner? Gone. Gone? Yes, they abducted her tonight, right under our very noses, in the middle of a crowded theatre. I thought she was confined to the hospital? Mmm. She was. What about your end, any new developments? Yes. I have been told to drop the case. Mr Merlin has very powerful friends. Well, that kills any chance of a lead from him. Well... unofficially, I kept watch on him. Just as well, too. We found he is going to London. When? He arrives tomorrow morning, by the boat train. (BRAKES SCREECHING) (CHATTERING) I got his number, sir. I saw who was driving. Mr Nikki Sheldon. - Sheldon? - I had my suspicions last night. All right, Sergeant, you check that car, and find out where Merlin's staying. What are you going to do? Arrest him? No, no, I can't do that. There's no proof. Besides, it wouldn't help us get Marie and the other girls back. But you can't just let him go free. The important thing is to find out what Fu Manchu is plotting, and then stop him. - Yes, but if... - Sheldon is the first lead we've had. But if he's working for this Fu Manchu, he must know where the headquarters are. - Couldn't we...? - You don't know Fu Manchu. He covers his tracks, and he trusts no-one. Sheldon probably has no idea where the headquarters are. Someone must know. There must be... Merlin. - You said all the men were taken there. - Yes. But he probably doesn't know where he was taken. Anyway, we can't force him to tell us. Sometimes, I wish I was back in Burma. He'd have talked then, all right. What do you mean? Have you ever heard of the dust that loosens tongues? I've seen it used. The dust that loose...? Yeah. Yes, of course. That's, er... That's a crude natural form of one of the sodium drugs. You have heard of it, then? Drug research is my field. I came across the Burmese drug when I was doing tropical medicine. It paralyses the patient, but, er... he retains the power of speech and memory. And he can answer only the questions you ask him. And he cannot help telling the truth. (KNOCKING) - Good evening. - Good evening. - Monsieur Merlin? - Yes. What do you want? Mr Sheldon asked me to call. Oh. What for? About these. Very well. Come in. You are alone? Of course. - In here. - Thank you. Mr Sheldon wanted you to look at this. (HEAVY BLOW) What's happened? Who are you? (GROANING) What is your name? Jules Merlin. You have a daughter who was kidnapped. Do you know who abducted her? Fu Manchu. Have you ever met Fu Manchu? Yes. Where? At his headquarters? Yes. Where is it? I don't know. How long were you there? (SLURRING) Eight days. And in that time no-one mentioned the name of the place? - Yes. - Someone did mention it? Yes. What is the name? The Temple of Karna. The Temple of Karna. Good. Now... do you know what Fu Manchu plans to do? He will dominate the world. (REGULAR BEEPING) The new circuits have cut the run-up time by half! (BEEPING SPEEDING UP) We can hold the output steady at this load indefinitely. But no higher? We dare not. (BEEPING STOPS) That is sufficient for the Windsor Castle? Yes, but not any of the major targets. Very well. Prepare for the Windsor Castle in six days. - The set will be in place? - Yes. And, Feng... Everything must be ready for the first major target on the 11th. Of next month? Then we need Lentz here, as quickly as possible. He will be here. - Anything happening? - No, Sergeant. He went to lunch as usual. Two of our men followed him, and he came back to the room an hour ago. Nobody spoke to him, or tried to contact him? Not a soul. LENTZ: Who are you? What are you doing here? I have come to give you your final orders. Are you the one who has been phoning me? - Yes. - Where is my daughter? You won't get away with this. If anything goes wrong, you will not see your daughter alive again. Remember that. Now, your car will arrive at the front door at precisely half past, which is six minutes from now. You will be ready, and you will get into the car at once, and you will do exactly what the driver tells you to do. But the police will follow. Of course. Remember, half past precisely. And if you try to warn anyone, the phone is cut. (DOOR CLOSING) - Who's that? - One of the cleaners. That's his car. We didn't have any message he was going out, Sergeant. (ENGINE STARTING) I'll follow it. You ring the Yard. They are following. I know. Get there as fast as you can. This is ridiculous. He's been driving in circles now for 45 minutes. Hmm. Almost as if he's stalling for something. - Look out! - (TYRES SCREECHING) POLICE DRIVER: Sergeant, look! I'm sorry, sir, but they got him. All right, Spicer, you did your best. But that, er... flying tackle of yours was certainly worth seeing. You were here, sir? Yes, over in the clubhouse. But for heaven's sake, sir, you could have stopped them. They've got Otto Lentz, sir. Have a look in the car, Sergeant. But I don't... Who was that in the aircraft? - Franz Baumer. - Baumer? He's been impersonating Lentz for three days. Why? Because we don't know where the Temple of Karna is. Now we're going to have a man right in there. (PORTAL THUDDING) She has spirit. So you would find out, if these men were not holding me. We shall see. (FINGERS SNAPPING) These girls will be your companions. At first, they, too, were unwilling but now they live only to serve me. Five of you, pick her up. Raise the trap door. Lower her. (GASPING) (WHIMPERING) (SCREAMING) (SOBBING) (TRAP DOOR RUMBLING) You have no will. No mind of your own. You will do only what I command you to do. Even to death. (ELECTRONIC HUM) All is in order. We can begin the build-up. There's no urgency. We will take the full hour. That will be safer. Advise London that the build-up has begun on schedule. Destruction One will take place at noon exactly. (SWITCHES CLICKING) Hello, Pierre! Good to see you. You are looking well, my friend. - So you're on holiday, are you? - Officially, yes. Unofficially, I am following up this Merlin affair. In your own time? I don't like to be told, "Drop the case". Good. Well, I can give you a lot of new facts. Things have been developing pretty fast. Let me give you some information first. When Merlin came back, he had a number of projects needing his urgent attention, but he dropped them all. Instead, he associated his company with some people called Wireless International. And they've put up an aerial? Yes. A peculiar sort of affair, like a round, hollow dish. Yes. How did you know? So that's how he plans to do it. Sergeant? Bring me all the dossiers of the Fu Manchu kidnappings, will you? I've already checked. After every kidnapping, the men concerned joined Wireless International. Gone to the Yard? On a Saturday? He won't be late, sir. Would you like a drink while you wait? 11:20, it's a bit early. (DOOR CLOSING) FU MANCHU: (OVER RADIO) Commissioner Nayland Smith, you have but little time to live. I could have arranged your death at the moment you switched on this wireless set, but that would have been too quick. Soon, you will die, because I shall control the world. I have the power to destroy cities. And any city that defies me shall be destroyed. But first, men must die. Specially selected men. And the first shall die on Saturday, when I destroy the Windsor Castle. (ELECTRONIC HUM) Phase two coming in now. (HUM CHANGES TONE) In and steady. Position the aerial. (WIND HOWLING) Aerial positioned and locked. Direct it onto London. FU MANCHU: Men must die. Specially selected men. And the first shall die on Saturday, when I destroy the Windsor Castle. That's today. Petrie? Get hold of Sergeant Spicer, will you? Tell him to have three carloads of men ready to move in ten minutes' time. - We'll pick 'em up at the Yard. - Right. - No, don't use that one. I want it. - All right. Here, Pierre, look up the address of Wireless International, will you? If the aerial's there, we may be able to stop them. What can we do about Windsor Castle? I'm calling up the Home Secretary now. I'm going to have it cleared. - (MACHINE BLEEPING) - Fifteen minutes to go. (TAPPING MORSE CODE) Message from Karna, Mr Sheldon. - Final phase begins at 11:50 our time. - Right. Set the aerial on bearing 198.5. Well, the royal family aren't there. And they're clearing the staff out as soon as possible. Spicer says he'll have the men waiting at the Yard. - Good. Any luck with that address? - Yes. Number seven, Tower Wharf, Limehouse. Ah. SHELDON: Nothing from Karna? (MORSE CODE TAPPING) (RAPID BEEPING) Message five. (HORN HONKING) Send message four. (HORN HONKING) (HORN HONKING) Full on all circuits. Message three. Onto the roof! Destroy that aerial! Message two. Message one. (GRUNTING) Thank goodness for that. They can't destroy Windsor Castle now. There's no connection, nothing. This is just a dummy. Transmit. (REPEATED BEEPING) (BEEPING SPEEDING UP) Stand by to switch onto target. (CHILDREN LAUGHING) Destroy! (SEAGULLS CRYING) I should have known. How could you? He said "the" Windsor Castle. "The." He's won every round. Not all. He hasn't got Lentz. But why the Windsor Castle? Why, why, why? Now, why was that the target? Now, wait a minute. He said particular men must die. I haven't even looked at the death list. One hundred and twenty-three dead, including crew. Sergeant Spicer, sir. - SMITH: Well, any luck, Spicer? - No, sir. The special team went over every inch of the place. Every bit of the wireless equipment was phony, but the office equipment seemed to be in order. I see. No sign of anyone? - Not a soul, sir. - Hmm. Where's Inspector Grimaldi? He stayed, sir. - At Wireless International? - Yes, Doctor. He was puzzled that the boiler room should be on the ground floor instead of in the cellar. He said he had a hunch about something and was going to spend the night there. - Still no sound? - No, nothing. - You're sure you heard someone? - Yes. After all the others left, there were footsteps, and then nothing. Four hours. He couldn't be still for that long. Shall I tell them to stay here all night? No. If Nayland Smith returns tomorrow, he may drill his way through, and find us. They nearly did this afternoon. We must get out. (CREAKING) All clear. We must move quickly, and leave by the concealed entrance. They may have left someone on watch at the front. - DACOIT: Do we return here? - SHELDON: No. - You have the second small set? - DACOIT: Yes. Take your three men, and install it at the target tonight. Then go to the quarters, and stay there. How long before we operate again? Why? I have to know which cells to use. They deteriorate. SHELDON: Destruction Two is on the 11th. Your team, strip down the aerial, and remove the transmission gear. We'll move it to the alternate headquarters. - Now? - At once. Anything that isn't out of here tonight will have to be abandoned. The rest of you, come with me. Hurry! Leave the set on the table. Now, open the escape door. (YELLING) (GROANING) (GRUNTING) Good Lord, of course! - The Arms Conference. - PETRIE: What? The Arms Conference, Petrie. It's on the 11th. That's what Fu Manchu's after. - My good heavens! - What a target. Every leading military nation of the world will be there. "Seven Heads of State, seventeen Ministers of Defence," "six Ministers of the Interior, eighteen Commanders-in-Chief," "forty-three other generals." But... But the conference isn't all in one place, is it? No. Various committees from it are meeting all over London. But on the 11th, Petrie, every single one of these people is attending a service of dedication at St Paul's. Ah, Lotus, pack a bag for me, will you, please? I'm leaving for Paris, first thing in the morning. Yes, sir. What do you want? SMITH: Your help. I know that Fu Manchu is holding your daughter prisoner, and is forcing you to work for him. You built the set that killed all those people on the Windsor Castle. No. It isn't true. - You didn't know that that was the target? - No, no. Do you want to know what the second target is? No. I can do nothing to help. Nothing! He would kill Michèle. Monsieur Merlin, I'm not giving you the choice. You'll help me or I'll arrest you for murder. And when that happens, Fu Manchu will have no further use for your daughter. She will certainly be killed. (SOBBING) Well? (SIGHING) What do you want to know? Three things. First, an exact description of what the set looks like. Yes. Then I want to know how to disable the set without moving it, so that no-one but yourself would know that it had been sabotaged. That can be done. The third? A hidden aerial has been installed over here by Wireless International. I want to know the exact bearing it operates on. Has something gone wrong, Father? Lentz refuses to work with Feng. He says that Feng has made a wrong estimate, that he does not understand the problem. - But Lentz can make it safe? - Yes. It is unlike Feng to be so wrong. He was so sure of the problem. Maybe Lentz is stalling. Why should he? I don't know. He's a strange man. He is also a brilliant engineer. He knew which way we were travelling. - He knows we're in mountains. - How? There were signs he could sense. He's a mountaineer. I have a whole file on Lentz. It is well known that he suffers from vertigo. On the dams, they have to construct a special basket for him, because he cannot stand near the edges. But he is a mountaineer. He told me. Then he is not Lentz. He must be. We watched him for days, and spoke to him. It is time for you to rest, Herr Lentz. Goodbye, Father. Franz, look out! Franz? A strange way to address Otto Lentz. LIN TANG: Will you leave him to me, Father? No. He may be more useful alive. Put him in a cell. (DOOR SHUT AND LOCKED) (MARIE SOBBING) (WHISPERING) Marie. Marie. - Don't cry. Fu Manchu said... - (TAPPING) SMITH: Rome. And the bearing from Rome, 249.5. Atlas Mountains. Do you think it's right? Well, there's no reason to suppose that Merlin and the Italian were lying. Not at this stage. But the Temple of Karna? Do you think it's in the middle of the mountains? It's not in the middle. Here we are. In the foothills, right on the edge of the desert. That ties in what I told you about the dacoit coming from a hot climate. No town or village anywhere near it. The nearest is Ouarzazate, and that's 40 miles away. What's this? "French Army." A fort. I should be able to get some men from there. - Who are you? - Ssh! - (WHISPERING) Who are you? - All the ladies, they are my friends. I've come to help you. - You can get me out of here? - Yes. - (CREAKING) - Look, tonight... Look, tonight, men are going out to Sidi B'Hair to get the supplies. - Yeah? - I'm supposed to go with them. Look, here, take my robe. - You want me to take your place? - Yes. Come on. Listen, here are the keys. Now, you take the ropes, and tie me up. - Now down there, through that door. - Yeah. - Through another door. - Yes. The second door. There are a lot of Arab men waiting with a lot of load. - Uh-huh. - Now you go there, you pick up one of the loads, and wait with them. Right. Now, good luck. Hey, wait. Wait, it must look real. You must hit me. - I can't. - No, you must. (INDISTINCT CHINESE CONVERSATION) (DOOR CREAKING) Every inch has been searched, Father. He cannot be in the temple. The doors did not open. He cannot have escaped. Do you want me to search again? No, not you. The Arab who allowed him to escape. He will conduct the search. He's called Abdul. Tell him that if the prisoner is not found, his body will feed the snakes. (ELECTRONIC HUM) Feng. I have been thinking about Destruction Two. We must continue. Without the real Lentz? We cannot. We must. The set has been placed at some distance from the target, because we intended to use the full power. But now that we no longer have Lentz, there are only two alternatives. Yes? We can increase the output beyond that used in Destruction One. To overload this system would start a chain reaction that could destroy the whole place. All of us. You know that. Or we can move the set into the target. At this late stage? Is that possible? They are the only alternatives. - We could postpone... - No. We are ready. When those men die, I shall rule, and the world will be mine. (BELL TOLLING) How much longer do you think they'll be? Here they come now, sir. - So you found the set? - Yes. Mr Lentz followed Merlin's instructions, - and disabled it. - Where was it? In a little wireless shop, three streets from here. No wonder it took you five days to find... Good Lord! - Three streets? - SPICER: Exactly. Not only could St Paul's and the whole conference have gone up, but half the city of London as well. Can we let Nayland Smith know that all is safe now? Yes, I'll send him a cable. - Tell him we haven't moved it. - And we're watching it. Right. Now, he may have left the fort and started a search. Now, the next area to search is from this ridge here. - Now, when the patrol gets back... - FRENCH SOLDIER: Sergeant, le patrol! Baumer? Bring him in here, and get some water. - Where did you find him? - Coming out of the foothills. (PANTING) We cannot let them kill Abdul. But if he tells where Franz is, they will murder him. We must do something. We have the knives, but only three of them. That's not enough. We've always said we must have one each before we can do anything. You know, I've been thinking. Have you noticed that, every time the machinery starts, they send most of the guards away? Yes. Abdul says they are needed on the experiment. That is when we must do it. When they are all busy. Abdul could come with us. (SIGHING) It's like a fortress. You'd need at least a hundred. - No, the fewer, the better. - Why? Because if we made an open attack, you can imagine what Fu Manchu would do to those girls. No, we must use stealth, and quickly. I see. Now, tomorrow is the first day of the Arms Conference in London, and he plans to destroy all the delegates in St Paul's. Good heavens! Haven't you cancelled it? And have him wipe out a dozen cities in revenge? But you can't take a risk like that with the Arms Conference! There is no risk, Franz. We found the set, and disabled it. What is it? That was Sergeant Spicer. The set's gone. It was there when the shop closed. Nobody's been in or out. Yet half an hour ago, when Spicer checked, the set had gone. They may be just moving it. And supposing that they test it, or check it, or overhaul it? They would discover the reversed section. There's only twelve hours before the service in St Paul's. - We'll never find it in that time. - There is one other way, though. They are transmitting their energy as sound signals. Now, we've recently discovered that you can block a sound signal. We call it "jamming". What you do is, you transmit the stronger signal on the same frequency, and that stops the receiver from picking up the original signal. You think this might work? It could. It could. We must find their frequency. And for that, we need the cooperation of the British Broadcasting Company. Right! - Whom are you phoning? - One of the directors of the BBC. For once in his life, Uncle Richard Petrie can be of some use to somebody. (ELECTRONIC HUM) It is from London. Read it. "The set is in a copy of a police van." "It will park outside St Paul's at exactly five minutes to eleven." "That is ten minutes after the service has begun." "Everything else is in order." Excellent. Start the build-up. (GENERATOR HUMMING) (MUFFLED RUMBLING) (WHISPERING) Marie. Listen. The machines have started. Only one guard. We must do it now. Number three in. Number four in. Number five in. All circuits complete. There is no danger of overload. What if the staff in the power house make a mistake? Generate more energy than we need? That is impossible, since Feng installed his safety lock. When this lever reaches the bottom of the groove, we are at safety maximum. It is necessary to take the lever, and move it down into the second groove, before the auxiliary channels will feed in. (SCREAMING) Help, she has a knife! She's killed herself! (WOMEN CHATTERING) - Hey, quick, the keys! - No, no. We must save her! Quickly! If Fu Manchu finds out, he'll kill us. (GASPING) Phase two coming in... now. (ELECTRONIC HUM INTENSIFIES) In, and steady. (WHISPERING) Abdul. The walls open there. Then, passages lead on to the caves. - Do you know how to open them? - Yes. Come on. (EVERYONE YELLING) Nayland Smith! (YELLING) Stay in your places. - (SCREAMING OUTSIDE) - Lin Tang. Feng, take over from me, and position the aerial. Position the aerial. (EVERYONE FALLS SILENT) Who helped you to escape? Abdul. Who was the ringleader? Michèle. (SNAPPING FINGERS) As you were the leader of the rebellion, you shall be the first to go to the snakes. (GASPING) No! No! (CRYING) No, no. Aaah! Help! Help! Help! No! SMITH: Release that girl at once! Commissioner Nayland Smith. Foolhardy, as ever. Release that girl. She will not be released, and neither will you. But your presence will add to our celebrations. You have nothing to celebrate, Fu Manchu. The Arms Conference is safe. You are beaten. That is where you are wrong, Commissioner. In a few moments, there will be no Arms Conference. You will release that girl now, and order your men to line up over there. I will count three before I fire. One, two... Send her to the snakes. (MICHÈLE SCREAMING) (YELLING) SMITH: Franz! He's gone. Fu Manchu is gone. Seal the other doors. London report that the van with the set is on its way to the target. We'll have to blast our way into there. Not now. We must get out. I'm not letting Fu Manchu escape again. But he's building up the energy, and there's no safety device. If he overloads it, this whole place will go up. SMITH: Sergeant! Once we locate their signal, how long is it before we can start to jam it? Only seconds. We are ready to transmit now. It's a matter of searching until we find their signal. (GUNSHOT) More shooting. The temple must be full of soldiers. It is of no importance. Within a few moments, the entire world will capitulate to me. This is the destiny of Fu Manchu. Steady at 75. Transferring... now! (ELECTRONIC HUM INTENSIFIES) (WIND HOWLING) Wireless, send message five. (MORSE CODE TAPPING) You will wait here, and help the rest of them up. - (RAPID BEEPING) - Message four. The van should be there. - Hey! - MAN: No, come back! (ELECTRONIC HUM) (ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING IN DISTANCE) Message two. (WIND HOWLING) (PHONE RINGING) Yes? Speaking. (STATIC CHIRPING) No, nothing yet, Sergeant. Yes. Yes. Spicer says the opening ceremony began fifteen minutes ago. Message one. (CONGREGATION SINGING HYMN) Message one. (REGULAR BEEPING) (SINGING CONTINUES) (BEEPING SPEEDING UP) Got him! (SIGNAL HUMMING) We have located it. One, three, six, five... One, three, six, five. And four, two. And four, two. (BEEPING CONTINUES) (STATIC INTERRUPTIONS) (BEEPING SLOWS DOWN) The signal isn't getting through. Strengthen the signal, and advise London. No! Do as I say, strengthen it. FU MANCHU: More! We still have the safety lock. (LOUD WHIRRING) (INAUDIBLE) (BEEPING AND STATIC CONTINUE) (RATTLING) FU MANCHU: A little more. A little more, and we're through their barrier. - No, we cannot! - You will do it! No, no, no! FU MANCHU: Release that lock! Release it and hold it! I won't! Lin Tang, slide that lever over. Slide it over and hold it. A fraction more. We need a fraction more, and we're through. (GUNSHOT) (WHIRRING ACCELERATING) (HISSING) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) Down! For heaven's sake, down! (EXPLOSION CONTINUES) No-one could live in that. We must get these girls to shelter. (WIND HOWLING) FU MANCHU: The world shall hear from me again. (INAUDIBLE)
