DETECTIVE AGENCY Are you gambling tonight? Damn! Why do you always come to me only before you go gambling? Am I your sedative? I won't come next time. Okay? Can't you be sweet to me? Sweet-talking and cheating is my job. You have to pay me for it. I've never seen you carry a knife. Is it going to be dangerous tonight? Are you scared? I have two knives. I think you will never get to see the second one. I'll call you, bye. Hey. You better remember to call me. Let me tell you. Never use this color of lipstick again, okay? Why are you so picky when it comes to color? Think about it. If I can't tell the difference between a red heart and a black spade, what does living mean to me anymore? Bye. Why are you here? You really are here. Is she your wife? Yes. Wives nowadays are very capable. They actually can find their way here. I'm in a hurry. If you want to fight, wait until I get home. I didn't come here to fight. I just want an answer from you. I just put on my pants five minutes ago. Do you get it now? I was going to tell you something. But I guess that is not necessary now. Bye. Hey, I think you should go check on her. If a woman wants a fight, she just needs a good kick. But she is surprisingly quiet, that's scary. Look at what you're wearing, go back inside. King! Did your wife find out? It's time, drive. Chung. Recently, Fanny... Nothing. King, listen to me. When you were not home these few days, your wife vomited many times. I think she's pregnant. Right. Is everything in place? Jack has been working at Bad Temper's restaurant for three months. He works hard and gets everything done. Everyone trusts him. He can now set up the VIP room. Everything's in place. How is Bad Temper's card skill? So-so. Does he have at least 80 points? Yes. But he is very short-tempered. We will win for sure. King. To be honest, your wife is a good woman. You can have her. Really? Stupid. As conmen, we can't get distracted before we start the game. Do it well or not at all. Just like Macau Mon. Your idol? My target. I have to beat him. I want to be like him. Getting rich from gambling. But I heard others say, anyone who offends Macao Mon will regret ultimately. There is always an exception. Maybe I will be the first one. Two of spades, two of hearts. Four kings. Three tens, no ten of clubs. Three, four, five and six. You've been coughing the whole night. I am allergic to cigar. Nowadays, if you don't like cigars, then you're not a man. A pair of jacks. Three aces. You better play your cards now. Straight flush. Are you really this good? If you can't beat it, then pass. Pass. Three threes. Are you kidding me? Bad Temper, behave yourself or else no one will play with you again. I just feel kind of weird. It's like he can see through my cards. Does anyone want to cut? Sure. Hello. I'm sorry, one second. What is it? King, let's break up. You called me just to tell me this? I have one more thing to tell you. Because I think you have the right to know. I'm pregnant with your baby. But I will not let you see him. Hey! Do you still want to play? Hurry up! Don't be so mad. Watch your stupid mouth! Or I will make you give all my buddies a blow job. - Let's begin. - Wait. I want to trade cards. Give me yours. Bad Temper, there is no such rule. My place, my rules! Quick! Quick. A pair of sixes. A pair of sevens. A pair of jacks. A pair of twos. Do you have to use the biggest pair this early? What do you think? Three aces. Are your cards that good? I wonder. I was letting you hit me at a pair of sixes. But I didn't know your luck was that bad. Cards, please. Enough! Are you doing magic? Calm down. I think you should go home and have some sex tonight. What? It's not going to be you! Look into the mirror. You face looks like a pile of shit! Hey, show some respect! Damn you! Are you crazy? Bring her to the toilet! - Get the two guards to rape her! - Yes! I'm sorry. This is it for today. I lost four hundred cards, this is yours. We're rich! Chop his hands! Jack! - Jack! - Run! Run! Close the door! Jack! Jack! Jack! What did you give me? What did you inject into my body? Why... Why can't I see any color? You've injured your head seriously. You had a concussion. No! You have the right to remain silent. But anything you say can be used against you in court. We are charging you with murder. Is Bad Temper dead? What about my brother, Jack? I'm sorry. He lost too much blood. We couldn't save him. What about my wife? Where is she? There was no female injured at the scene. No. My wife was there. My wife was really there! My wife was there! Please, I want to see her! Calm down! I will call her for you. I couldn't reach Fanny. That night onwards, Fanny seemed to have disappeared. All her relatives and friends didn't know where she went. And I... was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to five years in jail. When I was in jail, Chung visited me twice. He also said that he didn't know where Fanny was. I became color-blind. Everything I see is all in one color. I understood that if I didn't learn something in jail in those five years, I wouldn't be able to catch up with society when I'm released. So, I decided to learn something. I learned how to use a computer to store all the horse racing records. I also learned to use formulas to predict gambling results. Old guy, what's taking so long? - Which horse should I bet on tonight? - I'm done. The first race, horse number four, five and seven. And the second one, horse number two, eight, and twelve. At last I realized something very important. That is out of ten gamblers, nine of them are cheaters. In this world, if you don't cheat, you will never win. Open! It's good! I lost everything! I'm not Skinny Dragon! You got the wrong man! You are, I know you well. Let's go! Eastwood. Please don't get any closer, you are about to kiss me. Anything going on? No. I got arthritis recently, so I couldn't get any news. Really? Nothing? I heard that Mr. Leng's fellows are always gathering. Are they making a big deal? Eastwood, I'm only a gambler. I'm not a gangster. I can give you tips for Saturday's race. The ninth race. Man Tat said that number eight will surely win. Who is Man Tat? Ng Man Tat. You... Dickhead! Nonsense! Let me tell you, when I call you, you have to answer at once. Or you know what will happen! If you have time, go to Peter's place for a free massage. You dickhead! I can't stand you anymore! Get down. - Why? - Get down! Eastwood, you can't be serious! What are you thinking about? Let me tell you. I haven't dealt with you for using fake money. Do you want me to kill you? Of course not! Let's do it this way! Rabbit jump all the way to the end of the street. Boss, it's crowded here. Why don't we find a quieter place and I'll jump for you? Now! Son of a bitch! When I become rich someday, you will really regret it! Skinny Dragon! Mr. Leng, what's up? What are you doing here? Nothing. My legs are hurting. I think it's because of the weather. So I'm exercising. In a crowded place like this? Boss, you know, I like to act! What's up? Your hero is getting out of jail tomorrow! My hero? King, the conman! He's getting out of jail tomorrow. He is a famous conman! The man you can only dream of! Right! So? - He is my buddy. - Yes. I'm not free tomorrow. I'm going to Shenzhen. - Go pick him up for me. - Okay. Take him for a shower. - Of course! - And a good meal. - That's great! - Then take him to a night club. - Yes! - Get him a girl. Okay! Here. Take this. - What? 300 dollars? - Is that not enough? Since I asked you to do it, the job must have some difficulty. You're a smart man! You can take care of it! Only 300 dollars? Do I have to take him to Grand Hyatt too? King! - Did you call me? - Are you King? I'm Skinny Dragon, but you can call me Dragon. Mr. Leng asked me to pick you up. How long have you been here? One hour or so. Did you see a woman with a kid? It's windy today, I think even kids won't pick their dads up. How can there be a woman with a kid? Hey, King! Are you done, King? It's cold. King! Are you done? So, did you find them? It's been so long, the number must have changed. Who are you looking for? My wife. I see. Now that you are out of jail, you can get lots of women with your looks. Come, let me take you for a shower and wash away all the bad luck. Good luck to you! Bad luck goes! All the bad luck leave at once, and all the good luck come. All done! Let's go for a massage. King. Why don't you have any tattoos? I'm a conman, not a gangster. Gangsters want everyone to recognize them. As a conman, you want no one to recognize you. That's right. I thought all gamblers are dressed nicely and have their hair gelled. You really think looking like that can win you millions? - That's only in movies. - Right, only in movies. King. I heard that you are good at winning lots of money. I'm a good conman. Can you take me as a trainee? If I teach you, then I'll have one more enemy. Then can I be your assistant? If you can keep your mouth shut, I might consider it. Okay. King, you really are something! King! - What? - Where are you going? Massage! Forget it. Those girls will only massage for a few minutes, then they will give you hand jobs. And they will charge you for it too. - Let's eat, okay? - Okay! Mr. Leng told me to treat you to a great meal. We have fish and meat here. I've tried my very best. Come on, eat. What do you think? Do you think I'm cool? King. Don't be like this. Come on, smile. It's no big deal. Lots of my friends have been put into jails before. But the strongest always survive. You're educated. I always watch those charity show on TV, I copied their lines. Do you really want to help me? Starting tomorrow, we will make money together. That's great! King, that's great! Here. Eat up. After this, I'll take you to the karaoke. Be happy! CALIFORNIA RED KARAOKE Please give me a cup of potion To forget love To exchange for a night with no tears All of my true feelings Let the rain drop on it and the wind blow it The love I gave out can't be taken back Even if I'll get drunk and heartbroken At least you won't see me cry You're quite good at singing. So-so. I can't catch up to some of the beats. You know, I've always wished to be a good singer. Everyone in my family has some singing potential. Like my sister, her voice alone can attract many men. Your sister works here? Yes. She's a bar girl here. But she's a fool! She gave all her money to a boy studying in America. She's a good girl. I think she's stupid. Only women spend men's money. How can there be an opposite? I need to go to the restroom. I didn't ask for a girl. Where is Skinny Dragon? He went to the restroom. Please tell him I'm not going to pay his bill. Are you his sister? - Have a seat. - No, thanks. I haven't seen you before. Your brother just took me in. You seem like a nice man. Don't hang around him, he will bring you down. Don't smoke too much. You're not young anymore. No! Rocky! Be careful! No! I don't want to do this! Neck bridge! No! Rocky, no! Please stop! Please, Rocky. Don't do this. Please don't! Come on, Kimmy. Come down. Rocky. You don't have to treat my friends like this. If you don't let me kiss you, I won't kiss anyone. I'm not interested in sex. You'll only be disappointed. I've waited for so long. I don't mind the disappointment! You're always like this! How dare you hit me? Bitch! Rocky, if you want to have fun, I'll get you the right girl. Ching Ching cries easily, she can't handle it. Shut your hole and get out of my face! Leave now! Get her out of here! - Then... - Get out! Ching Ching, don't make Rocky mad again. - All right. - Play the guessing game. Okay, I'll play with you. Fine. If you lose, you have to come with me. But if you lose, you have to leave. Okay. What is wrong with you? Why the rush? Skinny Dragon, your sister is in trouble! Really? Who is bullying her? Rocky! That guy is not a good thing. He wants to screw your sister tonight, what are we going to do? Is calling the cops a good idea? Cops? Cops? Is there an accident? No! My sister is in deep trouble. Really? That jerk is a well-known gangster. He will never lose. Women who sleep with him will end up in sorrow. Are you a poet now? - No... - What are we going to do now? Open the door! You've lost, bitch! - Open the door! - Sir! The stick is for pool, not for you to bang on the door. - Who are you? - What now? - Who are you? - So... So you're Skinny Dragon. Are you trying to scare me? - What? - She is a bar girl and this is her job. To me, I can sleep with any girl I want. - What? - You're right. Anyone can have sex with any girl in this world, but it's either with you or me. Whitehead, what is your problem? Do you want to get your ass kicked? Someone told me that you're good at pool. Why don't we play one round? Don't you know that I always play with Marco Fu? - Me too. But I've never seen you before! - What? How about this? We'll play one round. If I win, I'll take Ching Ching. But if I lose, you'll get to have her and an extra 30,000 dollars bet. Bet on 30,000 dollars? Okay! Don't move! - Hey! - What? We don't have 30,000 dollars. I don't have 30,000 dollars either. Don't mess with him then. I'm a little scared too, let's go then. - I don't care, you have to play. - Hey! - I'll start first! - You don't have to yell! Be careful! It went in. Seriously. Damn, I'm lucky. Pay up. Bastard. Acted all stupid. Watch your back. Thanks. No more pool from now on, let's go! Bye. Ching Ching! Come out. It's me, your brother. You don't have to peep, it's me. Come. - Thanks. - Give it to me, I'll keep it for you. Hey! I need to find somewhere to stay. Hey. I have an extra room in my house. - You... - Does it cost 30,000 dollars? It's a long rent payment. I was going to put this room up for rent. But my boyfriend doesn't like the idea, so it became a storeroom. Hey, Ching Ching. I'm interested in this room too. You're interested? Get out! It's okay. I want to get something straight. Okay. I have a fiancé, his name is Raymond. He is studying Economics in America. I only have him in my heart. So I'm willing to be a bar girl to help him finish his study. I let you stay here because of money. So please don't have any fantasy that includes me in it. Besides, we have a huge age difference. Let me tell you something. Before I went to jail, I had a wife. Her name is Fanny, she's very nice. She gave birth to my kid. I regret that I didn't take good care of her when I had the chance. After I got out of jail, I totally lost contact with her. I've never seen my child before. Even so, I only have them in my heart. So you can relax. I will not have any fantasy that includes you in it. That settles it. How about this? Let your brother stay here. I will take care of him. In Hong Kong, most people bet their money on football matches and horse races. Okay. - Let me teach you how to bet on horses. - Great! The Smart, Pearl, Queen Diamond. Master, the ninth race is about to start! - The last two horses left. - One horse just entered the barrier. There's only one left, hurry. Come on. Which one should we bet on? Hello. Is this Hung's Restaurant? Yes. Two bowls of wonton noodles and a plate of vegetable. Number 34, fourth floor, room A, thanks. I thought you were going to bet. We wasted so much time and you didn't bet a penny? It's not a safe bet, why would I bet? The trainers bet less than ten races a season. If you bet on every race, even Bill Gates will be broke. This is boring. Do you want to be a happy loser or a boring winner? You are the master, I'll listen to you. We'll do it again next week. Record all the race results and we'll study that later. Master. We're gambling, not going to school. Nothing worth having comes easy. I think the wonton noodles are not enough. Let's go out and eat later. Okay? Okay, I will take you to a place where the food's free. Okay. I thought it would be a good meal. Is this not good enough We will have shark fin soup later, and now we're having crab meat noodles. Waiter! - Bring me another glass of orange juice. - Sure. Hey. Do you know that fellow? Not really. I'm closer with his wife. Did you give them a red envelope? I put some newspapers in the red envelope. What if they find out? It's in the red envelope! Who will know who did it? Sir. The total of your bill is 140 dollars. What? Are you kidding me? I'm a guest. The order is that the juice and noodles have to be paid by the guests. - I'll kick your ass! - Stop! - Let me kick his ass! - Pay! I won't teach you anything if you don't pay the bill. Pay. Hurry. I'm sorry. - I'll kick your ass! - Thanks. This is what we call karma. Sit. No, I want to make some money. Hey! Don't do it here. There are many conmen here. Eat. Come on. King. You're a conman. Why are you acting like a gentleman? There are eight different kinds of conmen. Master, provider, beauty, liar, informer, warrior, negotiator and gossipmonger. A total of eight types. I am the master and I do it for a living. What about the other seven types? The provider's job is to set up the trap. The beauty's job is to use beauty to trick a man. The liar's job is to disappear after his job is done. The informer's job is to gather information. The warrior's job is to take care of the dirty work. The negotiator's job is to negotiate. The gossipmonger's job is to make rumors, so people will be easily cheated. That's a lot of people! It sounds like mission impossible. Yes. Eat up. All win! Bet small! What are they playing? Should be Shoot the Gap. You will get two cards at first. Let's say you get an ace and a ten. If the third card you get is between the ace and ten, then you win. But if you get a jack, queen and king, then you lose. But if the third card is an ace or a ten, that's called hitting the post. You will lose double. Are you done eating? If you're done, then go. Let's leave before they find out about your red envelope. Bet big and you can win big! Skinny Dragon, come here! Come and play a few rounds! - Come here! - Hey. - Hurry up! - Let's win the 140 dollars back. - Hey! I called you many times! - Quick. There are more than 20,000 dollars on the table. - Deal. - Deal it! Okay. Here! Is this for real? How come you have so much money? These are my savings. - I will bet 5,000 dollars. - No regrets. Here! You hit the post! You lose double. Give me 5,000 dollars more! Have you learned your lesson yet? Let's go! Hey, buddy! You look good. Come and play. It's okay. Sorry. You can always win the money. Why didn't you play? There is something wrong with all 52 cards. You can't win. What do you mean? He marked all the cards. Look at him. He wears hair gel. If he put some of that on the cards, he will know what the cards are by its reflections. How does he know? Usually, conmen will mark their cards into 40 squares. Four different rows across for the shapes and ten columns for aces to ten. A card with a longer strip of reflection on both sides is a jack. A card with the shorter one is a queen. No reflection means king. Also, he has always been dealing from the second card. He deals every hand from the second card. He puts the ace on top for emergencies. That son of a bitch! I stupidly lost 10,000 dollars. So what? That was your choice. - Then... - You want to win it back? Let's go! But he is a cop. So? Give me the money. A thousand dollars. That is all I have. If we lose the last 2,000 dollars, we will have no money for the bus. Can you make it? Go take the bus then. Okay! Give it a chance. - Come! - Come! I want to play a hand. Okay. Here! The second card! There you go. Four and nine. So if I have a 5, 6, 7 and 8, then I will win, right? Whatever, dumb ass! All right. I want to bet all the money on the table. Hey. It's more than 30,000 dollars here. Okay, that's good. I really want to bet all the money on the table. Are you sure? Deal it. Since I'm betting big, can I pick my own card? Okay. That's great! Pay up! Buddy. - He's so lucky. - Are you messing with us? - That was impossible. - Let me tell you. When you cheat the next time, do it better. Don't let others catch your mistakes. There are many people here. You win. Ignore him. See that man with Skinny Dragon? After the dinner is over, go catch him. Let me cut off all his fingers. I'm going to the restroom. I will go alone That's very fat! Really? You like it fat? Then I'll let you have a taste! You like it fat, right? How can you call it fat? It should be called strong. Help! Help! Go! Who gives newspaper as a handsel? Damn it! Who did this? - Did you receive newspaper? - How did you know? A cop in the toilet was saying that he gave newspaper as a handsel. - What a bastard! - How can he be like that? If I were you, I would kick his ass. - Kick his ass! - Kick his ass! - Who is a cop here? - Me! - Hit him! - Help! You are assaulting a cop! Let me tell you. Don't let me see them again! I'll surely kill them. Let's go. You're crazy! - Hey! - Are you crazy? Why are there so many girls? We won some money at a wedding feast. So we decided to come here for a little fun. We're really paying tonight! Right! Thanks. No way! We waited so long for you! I was taking care of some important customers. A man from Macau was treating a group of friends from Taiwan. They just left. Wait. Who's that man from Macau? Madam said that he is very powerful. His name is Macau Mon. Stop acting! Pay up. All right. I haven't caught them yet. I'll take care of all the bills tonight. Come back again. He's Macau Mon! Do you know him? Who doesn't? He is the true King of Gamblers. He controls all the horse racing and soccer matches betting in Hong Kong, Macau and Shenzhen. And the underground index market too. He has a nickname called Shenzhen Soros. He will win no matter what. I wanted to challenge him five years ago. But he was always in Macau. Now he mainly lives in Hong Kong. He left all his work in Shenzhen. It is estimated that he can earn up to one billion dollars after the World Cup. - One billion dollars? - Right! If I have one billion dollars, I will trade it for my kid and my wife. Are you still thinking of your wife? This place is as big as a town, how can we find him? Are you confirmed that he is here? Who put your brother, Jack's remains here? One of my buddies. His name is Chung. When I was in prison, he visited me. But soon, he disappeared too. He told me it's around here. Is that him? IN REMEMBRANCE OF JACK It looks like someone was here a while ago. - What? - I'll be back. - What? - Hey! MONUMENT DEPARTMENT What is it, Master? Did you see your wife? I think so. She was with a kid. I think that's my son. Calm down, Master. I will help you to find your kid. What are you talking about? Maybe it's an illusion. A woman with a kid can't walk this fast. But someone has been here. Maybe it's someone who's kind. Forget it. I want to look around. Okay! Go look around. Master, I just saw a woman with a kid from up there. - Really? - Wait. Are your wife's breasts this big? No. I don't think so. Let's still go take a look. Her breasts are too big to be true! Hey! - Hey! - You're very nasty! King, two minutes left, but the odds are still changing big. Big bets on number five. Bets are placed on the others too. The dividend dropped from 90 to 70? That's right! We've been waiting for some time and we haven't bet a dime. Account number, 1123794. The passcode is 217377. Second race, 2,000 dollars on number five as the winner. On quinella, number five, seven, eight and twelve. 2,000 dollars. Starbeck is currently in the leading. - Go. - Then we have Sapphire and Handsome. When they reach the corner, there are two places left. Then Fairy is at second place. It looks like Starbeck is going to win the race. Now we can see Applause, Flying Jet and Crystal chasing up. First place is Starbeck, second is Flying Jet. And the third place is Ruby. Yes! We won! The winner is horse number five. Winner pays 935.5 dollars, place pays 146 dollars. The second one is horse number eight, the place pays... Master, we won 700,000 dollars! What's wrong, aren't you happy? It's only 700,000 dollars. What if you win 70 million dollars? Hey. We've won so much money, what should we do tonight? Whatever you say! - A good meal? - A good meal! We can pay for it! Okay? Hi. King. This is Raymond, my boyfriend. - Hello, King. - Hello. My brother, Dragon. You've met him before. Yes. Are you betting on horse racing? Am I bothering you? It's okay. You already did. - Have a seat. - Thank you. Raymond is on summer vacation. Is that so? - Where are you studying? - Princeton University. I've been to university too. Fu Kin University. Please be nice. That's right. I am going to exercise my large intestine to dump all the waste and other unnecessary items from my body. What do you mean? Take a shit! University student? Useless thing. Don't mind him. He's weird. It's okay. He was just kidding. - Raymond, right? - Yes. How much longer before you graduate? I graduate next year April. Then... I will get to see Ching Ching every day. We don't have to write letters anymore. You can use e-mail. No. She hates the computer. Yes. I'm not good at computer. I already taught your brother, he can help you. My brother? How about this? I'll help you. We have a pen and paper here. Write down your e-mail address. Maybe later. I think there is something wrong with that guy. That stupid face? I'm going to beat him up someday. I don't know why my sister likes him so much. I don't think he's a university student. Are you sure? My sister sends him money every month for tuition. Is there any proof? No. I think he's using your sister. Are you sure? Really. I tested him earlier. I asked him if he has an e-mail account, but he looked clueless. The students in America aren't like that. Really? Is he called Raymond? Raymond Chou, Chou Dai Wai. I'm going to call Princeton University and check it out. Okay. I'll pay for the phone bill. If he's lying to my sister, I'll make sure he pays for it! Angela! Hello! I miss you very much. Your car is so nice. Let me drive. - Where are we going? - Up to you. Let's go. You little son of a bitch. My lord! How can he go out with an old slut? I feel sorry for my sister. That bastard! What an old slut's gigolo! Drive safe. - Bye. - Bye. Bye! - Are you blind? - I'm sorry! Watch it! Bastard! Do you want my ass too? Go get yourself some drugs! Get the hell out of my face! Stupid! This bastard's business is quite good. All fully booked. Come to think of it, looks like it's not bad to be a gigolo. What's wrong? You don't seem happy today. I can't see you for six months after I go back to America. How can I be happy? You can call me frequently. No! The bill is too expensive. It's best to avoid it. My friend and I are planning to open a comic book store in America. I think it can work. But everyone has to put in 20,000 US dollars. Then it's 150,000 HK dollars? Don't worry. I will take care of that. Ching Ching. I owe you too much. I didn't say you have to pay me back. Tell them you are in. I will take care of the rest. Ching Ching. You are so good to me. I feel so guilty. Silly! Ching Ching, you have a new boyfriend? What are you talking about? - Where is the pool player boyfriend? - Rocky, stop fooling around. Why? Tell this lad to go kick his ass, go! Ching Ching, who is he? - Let's go. - Okay. Raymond, are you leaving? Such a coincidence! - You told me to come. - I told you to come? I am his fiancée, call me Ching Ching. You are... I don't care if you go out with little girls. Why did you ask me to come? What is she talking about? He is my little gigolo. Is this true? Your volcano is erupting! Raymond, you better explain this to me! The reason I've asked you to come is to tell her the truth. Ching Ching, we can't be together anymore. I love Angela. What are you talking about? He's telling you that he has never been to America. He e-mailed the letters to his friends in America, and asked his friends to post them back to you. Whitehead is here, get to work. Is that the truth? None of your business. Earlier, you told me to give you 20,000 US dollars. - Raymond, let's go! - Okay! Dragon! Let me do this. Take this! Stupid bastard! How dare you trick my sister! Stop! Stop! Don't trust those people again. I won't. I won't trust him anymore. Good girl. King! Don't die! I'm sorry. That's enough! Stop vomiting. The blood is sweet, swallow it. - Hey! - Why didn't you tell me a car is added? - You scared me to death! - Enough! Can't you tell her the truth later? Why can't you let an old person rest a little more? Congratulations! Don't go out with that bastard anymore! I won't. I don't think you can see him anymore. With this situation, he must be on his way back to China. How come you are in it too? King took me in as his student. - He teaches me pool. - That's nothing. I'm about to become the third best player in Hong Kong. Is he really scared? He doesn't have to go that far! - Skinny Dragon! - Hello! That stupid face hid in China and had plastic surgery. Now when the wind blows, his face will come apart. I thought that wasn't enough, so I printed a fake paper about King's death. It scared the shit out of him and he fled to Cambodia. - Where is King? - Master? - He is in deep thoughts right now. - King! - Master. - King! - King! - He is looking for you. - What's up? - King! - Sit, King. - Have a seat, King. I went on a gambling cruise yesterday and lost money. You're always so unlucky! I guess that ship is haunted. I lost for three consecutive times. I lost almost over two million dollars. Let me look at your palm. It's all messed up! Take a rest. - Yes, take a rest. - No way! King, I want you to help me. No. Hey! Master! Go and win some money. Then we can hire detectives to find your wife. We can go gamble for you. But you'll handle all the losses and we'll get half the gains. Deal? Forget it then. Master, let's go. - Okay! No problem! - Sure? Fair enough. I'll take control on the ship and keep quiet. Of course! There are over ten gambling cruises between Hong Kong and Singapore. That involves big money! I love gambling cruises. It's safe. How is that so? The owner is Macau Mon. Everyone knows that he is a straightforward person. Thanks. - Macau Mon? - Yes. Also, his left hand, Handsome, is always on the ship. - Handsome! - Welcome! - Handsome! - We meet again! I will pay. - Handsome! - Hello. - Hello. - Good luck! - Hey, Handsome! - What's up, Rocky? Haven't you lost enough money already? - I want to win it back. - Hi, Handsome! Good! Mon left me some money and told me to give it out. I don't know how I should do that. Just take the money away, or else it will be eaten by worms. - Handsome, you sure are a funny guy! - Handsome! Let me introduce to you my buddies. This is King and Skinny Dragon. - King? - Yes. Your name sounds familiar. I am Rocky's... fellow. Rocky. All your fellows are taller than you? Why is it? Have you heard of the name Bad Temper? No. I am Handsome. I'm Bad Temper's little brother. Isn't this like soap opera? Help yourselves. Is he high on drugs or what? Forget him! Let's go gamble. Bigger. Bigger. Damn it! Eight, the banker wins. Hey. What are you doing? He's betting on the player, so I'll have to bet on the banker. For Baccarat, you have to bet on the winning card. Not just to look at the cards. If you want to see cards, I will go buy you two deck of cards. Okay? Okay? Fine! I'm sorry. Nine, the player wins. - Yes! - Yes, we win again! Why do you want to look at the cards? Do you want to lose? It's boring if we don't see the cards. I will let you peek at it, okay? - Okay. - This is a little machine. It can read your heartbeat if you put your finger in it. See. Bet this much. Queen. Just six points. Bigger. Bigger. Bigger! Eight, the player wins. You gamble at least twice a week. You bet at least 100-200 games every time. Even the machine can't stand it, can your heart stand it? Who cares, you will play for me from now on! You want me to die? Thanks, four-eyes. King. We got leads. Why are you placing so little bet? What leads? Leads to bet on the player, isn't it? You can't trust any leads. All the leads are created by conmen to trick you. You can only trust your confidence. - We will wait. - Okay. Nine, the player wins. Eight, the player wins. Master, it's been a while. Should we still bet on the player? Look at the chart, the player wins less than five times. - Eight, the player wins. - It's really player. Do you believe it now? I'll take the dividend this time. What a joke. What should we bet on? You can choose. Thanks. Four million dollars. Finally, I won something. Half goes to King. Don't worry. I only worry he won't take it. Who said not to bet on the player? The player won 14 times straight. In that kind of situation, you have to bet equally. Keep betting on the player until the banker wins. Where should we go now? Let's go to karaoke, I'll sing for you. I only go to karaoke with chicks. - Handsome. - Handsome. Okay, I'll sing on stage and you can masturbate. Hey, I'm not going yet. Go ahead, I have to use the restroom. We'll wait for you at the karaoke. Stop running! Stop! - Let me go! - Why do you have to run? - Let me go! - Tell me! - I'm sorry, King. - What for? - What for? - I couldn't take care of Fanny. How is she? How is she? When she found out that you went to jail, she swallowed many pills one night and jumped to her death. What about my kid? Dead too. I'm sorry, King. Don't worry. It's not your fault. Forgive me. Do you work here? Give me your number. I'll call you. - Please give me a cup of potion - I'm right! He sings well. So I can have a life without grievance King! Where did you go? I saw an old friend. I think I know who that is. - So what? - Don't worry. I didn't like my brother anyway. But I want to talk business with you. - What business? - If I tell you, you can't back out. - Then save your breath. - Okay! We will talk again someday. I'll leave now. Have fun! He should be a singer. I'm back. Drink some water. It's almost lunchtime. Wipe your face first. I saw King yesterday. I lied to him and said you're dead. Will he believe me? It doesn't matter anymore. We will not be affected. Is it cozy? I thought you were dead. - You asshole. - What are you doing? What do you want? This is a family affair. I... I don't know why I should trust you. When I was in jail, I wrote many letters to Fanny. When you visited me, I told you to take care of her. And you did a great job. No matter what I say, I'm still wrong. I'm sorry. Why did you apologize to him? If not for him, my son and I would have starved to death. You want me to wait for you? If we waited for you, I would have been a hooker. I'm sorry. - Use the other leg. - Okay. Do you want to smoke? Try some, it's good. - Let's go. - King. This kid is pretty cute. Too bad he is a cripple. Hey, tell him your name. I am Little King, Diamond King. I'm pregnant with your baby. But I will not let you see him. If I have one billion dollars, I will trade it for my kid and my wife. What happened to you? I don't know. Ask my dad and mom. Can I take him out to play sometimes? Thanks. In the past five years, I've never been so happy. Today with Little King besides me, my world has become a colorful one. Everything in front of me has become very pretty. Look at them, they are so happy, but you're so sad. If you like it, get yourself a baby. You're very annoying. Stop thinking about that stupid face. Forget him. Think about how good your life is without him. You're single and happy now. Let's see when Master will start to like you and when you will give birth to his baby. Then you will have his last name and live happily ever after. Stupid. He will be yours someday. - King. - Hey. Come, let's take a seat. Was it fun? Hey. Why does she look so sad? Don't ask. She'll be even sadder. Play with him for a while, okay? Okay? Good boy. Please look after him. - I will go check on her. - Okay. Do you want to try something new and exciting? Hey. What's wrong? Are you still thinking about Raymond? Yes. But, I don't know. Let's do this, make yourself a goal. Are there any places you want to go to? Europe. Ask your brother to take you then. If he goes with me, I'd rather stay here alone. What about this? If you don't mind an old man coming along, I'll go with you then. I mean it. King! What a surprise. Your girlfriend? I am a baldy, but not as good as you. I have something that needs your help. I know you killed my brother. He is an asshole, serves him right. If you didn't kill him, someone would do it. If you help me make some money, I will call you my boss. Let's go. It's Macau Mon. I want to gamble with Macau Mon on Big Two. In Hong Kong, people only place big bets on Big Two and Baccarat. Baccarat is easy. Macau Mon calls himself the King of Big Two. I want you to challenge him. You rich people play around 3,000 dollars a card. Even if you win, you only get millions, you don't care about that. You really are a great conman in Hong Kong. But I have a bigger plan. Do you want to kill Macau Mon? Just as you said. Although I'm not close with Macau Mon, I don't have to help you. Really? You know what? I hate traitors like you. Macau Mon is your boss and you want him dead. How can I trust you? You have to. Let my wife go! Look at this! What an interesting tape. King! King! So? You're even worse than your brother. - Will you work with me? - No way. Are you scared? Little King, run! Run! Run, Little King! Run! Run, Little King! Run, Little King! Run, Little King! That kid is cute. He is crippled but can run so fast. Don't! Go to hell. Little King! Tell your boss to work with me. Or else he'll be doomed. Take this home and enjoy it. Let's go! King! Do you think I am useless? No. You're smart and brave. You win every time you gamble. You even make dumb people like my brother a better man. I think you're a great man. I used to think this way. Every time after I gambled, I always felt that I'm a winner. But this time, I feel like I'm the loser. I lost my family, time, and happiness. I even lost my confidence. So what if I am great? In the end, evil people like Handsome will use us to cheat and lie for him. You can beat him. How? My son is in the hospital. Chung and Fanny are in his hands. Even if I win, I might not be able to save them. But they are not the only ones you have left. You still have my brother, yourself and me. Are you crazy? After Raymond left, don't you know what I've been thinking? Let me tell you. Sometimes I really envy your wife. Are you crazy? We have a huge age gap. I wanted her to talk to him. Did I tell her to sleep with him? Fine, who cares? Shut up. - Are you really going to help... - Shut up. Are you really going to help Handsome? I have no choice. Macau Mon is cold-blooded and despicable. No matter you win or lose, you might not able to save your wife and Chung. We'll play it by ear. - Do you really want to help Handsome? - That's enough! - You really... - That's enough! I won't help you if I don't know the plan. Macau Mon is the biggest dealer in Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, Singapore and Macau. He won a lot of money from betting on World Cup. Two nights from now will be the final between France and Brazil. The whole world thinks that Brazil will win. So what? I know that the European mobsters are planning something. If Brazil loses, the whole world's dealers will win big. Macau Mon should know about this. Of course, he knows. He is a very good friend with the mafias. He knows Brazil is going to lose, so he accepted the betting of Brazil's winning. If Brazil wins, he will be broke. That night, I'll play Big Two on the ship, each card worth 10,000 dollars. I want you to make Brazil win. Make Brazil win? Do you think I'm God? You can do it. It's on TV. You'll bet ten million dollars on Brazil. I'll take half. It's not this simple. By the way, I received information recently. Macau Mon has a serious heart problem. You want him to die of a heart attack that night, right? Smart people's lives are always short. I'm not very smart. Can you tell me one thing? How can we make him have a heart attack? You must have an idea. TG7. A poison that dissolves in water. If he drinks it, it will create heart failure. Even the coroner can't detect it. Do you want Chung and Fanny to each take one too? - You can try. - Okay. Don't act all cool. Get out of the car! Stop at the side. I can't believe he knows our plan. Who cares? Are your men ready? Yes. After this incident, I will find and kill him no matter where he hides. Pay when you see the body. He is Director Squirrel and he is great. He is especially good at conducting live shows. He is over there. Curly! Skinny Dragon! - Hello. - Hello. This is my master, King. Hello, King. Is there any problem with the things I told you to do? No problem. I want it to look like a live show. And also commercial break. I want the famous host, Lam Sheung Yee. No problem at all. What? You have to win tonight. I won't lose. After we leave, go spend a night at your cousin's home. Meet us at the train station at nine o'clock tomorrow. We will go to Mainland China, then we will go to Europe. I will wait for you. If you don't see us after half past nine, then you have to go first. I won't leave without you two. Listen to me. Leave after half past nine. And that is a must. You have to go. - You have been standing here all along? - Yes. - You heard it all? - Yes. Let me tell you. We are going to face the pros tonight. If we win tonight, you can be God of Gamblers. You don't have to be God of Singers. Okay. King, let me ask you a question. - How's my singing skill? - Very bad. You don't have to tell the truth. Hey! I have a question too. - What? - Is your first name really Skinny? No way! Have you ever known anyone named Skinny? - What is your real surname? - Just call me Dragon. - Tell me, please. - No. - Stupid Dragon. - What? - What? - What? What? What did you say? Stupid Dragon. Don't laugh! Hey! Look at you. I fed you so well, but you didn't even ask me to be careful. Be careful. Okay. Bye! Macau Mon is waiting for you in the VIP room. Tonight's final is between France and Brazil. We can play Big Two and gamble on the game. What a happy night! I want to see Chung and Fanny first. Here. Look properly. They are still alive. Don't worry. Okay. King, let me introduce you. This is my boss, Mon. Everyone calls him Macau Mon. My buddy, Dragon, nicknamed Skinny Dragon. It doesn't matter who he is. Who cares? That's right! Just save your energy for the game. You brought so much money. I won't let you walk away with it so easily. Here is a bank check. Fifty million dollars. Let's bet on the game first before we start Big Two. Okay. If you bet on Brazil, we have a special offer for you. Here is our package. If Brazil wins, you'll gain 10 percent less. Which means if Brazil wins by a goal, I win 22,500,000 dollars. If Brazil wins by two, I win 45,000,000 dollars. Buddy, money doesn't come this easily. No pain, no gain. Okay! We will play Big Two and bet on the game then. Ten thousand dollars a card. Eight cards, double. Ten cards, triple. Thirteen cards, quadruple. I came with cash and a check. So I expect to bring back cash and check too. Of course! I, Macau Mon, always pay up when I lose. If you want to bet on fingers, then I will pay you with my fingers. Are you scared? Who is the other player? I'm here! Winner Gary! Why are you so late? I reached here early. So I took a nice bath first. Mon. I've never seen this guy before. Where did you find this loser? We'll know who's the loser after the game finishes. What's wrong with you? Who said you could speak? - Go out and take a walk. - Okay. I followed the guidelines, why isn't it working? I've got something. Damn! Why is it a TV program? Got it. Three of diamonds first. What's wrong? Why the rush? Go. Two of diamonds. Three threes. You have good cards. How can you break up four threes? I just hoped it would work. Luckily it worked, and you lost four times more. Very good. I, Macau Mon, haven't faced such a good player for a long time. Thank you. All right, a player just attacked. The one in blue top... Master, did you win? A little. He just got lucky. I am the King of Big Two. You've to play at least 200 rounds with me before determining the winner. How dare you look down on my master? How dare you hit me? Dragon! Bastard! Dickhead! King, what should I do with your man? A country has its laws. So does a family. This is your place, you take charge. Fine. Take him away. Get up! Go! Let's continue! Go in! Dickhead! You're still alive? Where is your boss? His boss is in the VIP room. So what? Don't tell me you're leaving him here. Look after the three of them. Dickhead! I told you that you will get it someday. What? So what if you are with that guy? And you think you're clever? How dare you avoid me! Act tough? Why are you acting like a woman? Use some strength! You dickhead! How dare you pretend to be tough! Do you like to fight back? Damn you! Damn! How dare you kick me! Damn you! So you want to pretend to be dead? Get in there! What's wrong with you? Shut up! Do you want me to rape you again? Why are you pushing me? Your wife is useless. She deserves to be raped! You want me to screw you too? Since we're so happy now, let's have more fun. Come on, let's play! What a gathering. Such a happy moment! Why don't we play the game of banging? Bang! Go away! Luckily, I have you guys to play with. You dickhead! You bastard! I can't stand you anymore! You treated me like a piece of shit. And embarrassed me in front of the crowd. You nasty scum! You cheated my money. You wanted me to masturbate in front of you. I didn't. You did. I didn't ask you to masturbate. I just want to frame you. - Can I frame you? - Yes. That's good. You jerk! I will kick your ass today! Damn! I didn't know I was this strong. Fanny! How's your chest? How's King? He is fine. He has everything planned. Let's go. - Is King really okay? - Can't you be quiet? - Hey, where are you going? - The Philippines. - No! Go to Sai Kung! - Okay. Ronaldo just got the ball. But he missed the goal. Damn! What's wrong with Ronaldo today? It must be the French girls. They distracted Ronaldo. Or maybe he just had too much sex last night. Twenty-seven minutes has passed, but there is still no score at all. It's zero versus zero. Zidane's got it by a header. That's a goal! - France scored first! - Zidane scored a goal! That's fantastic! There's still a second half. We got to work now! Quickly, film extras get ready. It's one to zero. France scored first? Change your clothes, stupid! Hey. Aren't you the famous commentator, Lam Sheung Yee? I am his older brother, Lam Sheung Wai! Stop eating and get to work. Or I will take 50 dollars off your paycheck. - Who do you think you are? - I'm your boss! Hurry up! Get to work! Get to work! Skinny Dragon, hurry! Coming! Petit passed the ball to the center to Aldair. And then returned it... - Ready. - Right at the center. Passed it to the center again. Ladies and gentlemen, the other commentator has just gone to the bathroom. I, Lam Sheung Wai... No, Lam Sheung Yee will commentate alone. Everyone just saw France score first with a header by Zidane. They have taken a one to zero lead. I think everyone is surprised by this result. Let's hope Brazil will play better the second half and that there's a change in the score. Let us go to commercial break first. Ericsson brought you the best game... Get into position! Hurry up! There are lots of people who like to drink soy sauce. Some like it sweet, salty, bland, - and... - Fatter, whiter. Is this for real? BEER SOY SAUCE I will pick Beer soy sauce. BEER SOY SAUCE There is only one reason. That is... Damn it! I mean Beer soy sauce. Who do you think I am? Five, four, three, two, one. Kick off! Before the match, everyone thought Brazil would win. But their performance in the first half was very disappointing. Brazil is changing their plan now. Ronaldo and a French player crashed into the French goalkeeper. Both men are down. This is not good! Brazil can get a penalty kick. Yes, the referee awards Brazil a penalty kick. Let's see what really happened. Ronaldo was pushed towards the goalkeeper. Barthez held Ronaldo down on the ground. Can Ronaldo stand up? Brazil got a penalty, and their fans are going wild. Ronaldo is fine! He is carefully putting the ball into position. He is going to take the shoot. Let's see what will happen. He shot, he scored! After the penalty kick, Brazil and France are tied now! Look at how happy Ronaldo is after scoring the goal! What happened to Ronaldo's face? You dropped a card. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Oh no! Skinny Dragon, cover your head! Ronaldo is very happy! He is covering his face with his jersey. Go back to live. BRAZIL 1 - 1 FRANCE France got a corner kick and Djorkaeff is going to take it. What is wrong with Brazil's goalkeeper? Zidane scored again with a header. Zidane scored twice and France leads two to zero. No, is two to one. Looks like Brazil must try harder. - Skinny Dragon has passed out! - No way! Go to commercial! One day, on a beautiful island, a high tech specialist, Leung Jing was on his way to have dinner with his mother-in-law. He suddenly detected a strange storm. The storm destroyed many countries. No one was able to stop it. A strong storm is about to reach the island within 30 minutes. But Leung Jing had the confidence to defeat this storm. He ordered a warning on one hand. On the other hand, he raced with the storm. He was lucky to escape from death, so he decided to save the kids on the dam. He risked his life and rolled down the hill. He finally had the whole situation under control. But someone was there long before Leung Jing's arrival. But who is this mystery Lemon? The girl is very pretty. Do you still want to play? Of course, I want! You haven't even put down a card. Oh, I forgot! No need. Four aces. Do you have it? Straight. Quadruple again? Wake up! Hey! What happened? France scored again! Why didn't you wake me up earlier? - Let's get back to work! - I am your boss! All right! Brazil's Cafu is attacking and is about to pass the ball. Desailly was there in time to kick the ball out of play. Desailly seems to be hurt. Brazil's Bebeto is ready to take the corner. Ready. Ready. Ready. Ronaldo takes the pass and he shoots! Even Barthez can't save this one. Ronaldo is really awesome! We are tied again! The score is two to two. The match is getting more exciting. Without any doubt, Ronaldo is this match's hero. Look at him! He is covering his head with his jersey again. He should be happy! Mon, are you okay? I am fine. You, bring us a glass of water. No, thanks. HANDSOME, KING, MR. LENG, BRAKE King. It's only me and you now. This is the last game. I'm still 20 cards ahead of you. If you don't beat me by more than ten cards, you can't beat me. It's not bad if you win the bet on the match. It's now two versus two. You're still losing. Unless it's three versus two. You can't predict things. Sometimes when you think you're winning, you're going to lose. Sometimes when you think you're losing, you might win. I can't see myself winning the game. Of course! You are losing by more than one thousand cards. You better pay up. Or we will charge you with interest. I think I can put one card down. What is this? You don't mind losing another game, do you? I can afford it, so what? The match is really exciting and awesome! France is on the attack again. Close-up shot! Piette is in the penalty zone and he shoots! What a pity! - He hit the post. - What's wrong? It's useless to hold your head, Piette. Who told you to hit the post? If the shot went in, then your team would win. If there is no more goal, then we will have to go to overtime. No overtime! The real match is three versus zero, you moron! Really? Ace of diamonds. Ace of spades? You're good. Two of diamonds. Why the rush? Hey! Who has the Big Two? Better use it now. The guy is very lucky today. You can really hold it. What's going on? Four jacks again? I'm going to lose again. Straight. Sorry. - You lose triple. - Again? How come no one used the Big Two? Who has it? All right, we can see Brazil's Edmundo pass the ball to Carlos. And Carlos passes the ball back to Edmundo. And he puts the ball in the penalty zone. Denilson gets the pass and he shoots! What a pity! He hits the post again. But Ronaldo is there and he puts the ball into the net! It's three to two. Brazil is leading now. They are winning. The score is now three versus two. There is not much time left. It looks like Brazil is going to win. The game is over! Bravo! Show the celebration tape of four years ago. Brazil is really great! Those who bet on Brazil sure is winning a lot! - Mon! - Let's watch the highlights. Mon! Mon! Mon, are you okay? Mon! Let's watch some commercials first. Don't drink it, there are germs. Don't drink it, there are germs. Of course! They are active bacteria. It's good for you! Commercial nowadays are very funny. But you can't see it. Dead man! I've already bet 100 million dollars on France. Now this ship and the casinos are all mine. Leave the money, the check and also yourself. You put poison in the water. - I didn't. - Hey! Although he beat me, but... Don't move! You killed my boss. So I will kill you now. Macau Mon is dead. I'm the boss now. Mon! It's none of my business! It's him! None of your business? I'm still alive, because King saved me. How? How did he do that? Remember the last game? Why did no one play the Big Two? Because I had it! THE WATER IS POISONOUS Do you understand it now? No! Don't kill me! Mon, no! Damn you! How dare you betray me? - Mon! - Bastard! - No! - Traitor! No! Who is looking for King? I'm Ching Ching, tell him I'm waiting for him. Hello. Is this King? Hello! What? I beg your pardon? You got the wrong number! Hey! Hey! King! Don't fool around! Get up, King! King! Get up, King! You'll be fine. King, don't be like this. Don't die, King! King! King, are you okay? I'm fine. - I'm fine. - No, you're not. - It's only an accident. - No, it's not. They hit you on purpose. Why can't they let you go? - It's only an accident. - No, it's not. - Believe me. - No! It really is an accident. Believe me, look at the driver. Skinny Dragon, what is wrong with you? I'm sorry, King! I thought you were going to leave me, so I drove a little faster. How are you? Do you want some medicine? Put some of this into your nose and it'll stop the bleeding. - You're stupid! - Trust me. It'll work! Stupid! Who told you to come here? If it wasn't for you, we would have left long ago! - It's going to work! - Hey! King! King! King! You bastard! Are you guys going to kiss? None of your business! Stop it! Stop the bleeding first...
