* [man] All right, deal 'em, big boy. Let's see who's the best. All right, here we go. All right, give me a good one. Come on, turn over, turn over. What you got? You got some paint on there, baby? [laughs] All right, here we go. Double or nothin'. Okay. [clicks tongue] Blackjack! [laughs] All right. All right, all right, we're on a bit of a roll here. Nobody misses with the Mississippi Gambler, baby All right. Five plays to the limit. All right, roll 'em. Alrighty. -[beeping] -Well... Yeah. Yes, I am. You call yourself a player, let's see what you got. All right, we gotta split these. All right. Come on, one big fat daddy pork roast. -[phone dials, rings] -Go on... Seventeen. Man. -Right here. -[woman] The Herald. Uh, yes. The editor's office, please. -Which department? -Uh, Mr. Alkin. Mr. Alkin's out of the office, sir. Um... oh, he is? Well, when do you expect him back? -Is this urgent, sir? -Well, yeah. This is, uh, Charles Duprey, from Moody Comics, Limited. I sent, uh, Mr. Alkin a comic strip, uh, two weeks ago called "Dusty's World." -Uh-huh. -And I think it's perfect for The Herald, but right now I have The Times chompin' at the bit, and I need to get Mr. Alkin's response as soon as possible. Perhaps you could try back in January, sir. Yeah, I suppose I could do that. All right, I'll call back after the New Year, then. -Happy New Year. -Thanks. Merry Christmas. -Hey, Willy. -Why don't you give it a rest, Charlie? Two days before Christmas, nine out of ten editors aren't even in the office this week. -Probably right. -Come on. Let's get the hell out of here. All right. Let me finish up this game. I'm ahead by a thousand. Hey, what is up with you, Duprey? You're about as much fun as a turd in a bowl of egg nog. Yeah, I know. -Shirley and I are splittin' up. -What? -Get out of here. -Yeah, she left me. How come you didn't say somethin', man? I don't know what to say. I was just hopin' that she'd come back, but she hasn't. Now I got this goddamn week's vacation, I don't even know what I'm gonna do. Hm... Well, what do you usually do? Usually I go to Vegas with Shirley. And this year we were gonna fly up to Reno for a change of pace. -Hm... -And I was really lookin' forward to it. Now I don't know what to do. Hey, Willy, I mean, you ever wonder if there's more? You know? I mean, if there's, you know, some reason in this life to be rather than just get by? No. No. But there's no point in thinking that way, when... I don't know. You get older, you get fatter, complacent. Then at the end of it all, you die. Well, if you're tryin' to cheer me up, you're doin' a crappy job. [laughs] * -Hi, Shirley. -Hello, Charlie. I thought you were at your mom's. -I'm surprised to see you. -I'm surprised to see you, too. I'm... I really have missed you, Shirley. -I would... -Charlie, please. -...try to work it out. -I only came to pick up a few things. I meant to slip in and out. I don't want to turn this into a thing. Shirley, can we at least talk about it? I'm sick to death of talking. Let's be strong, okay? * [crickets chirping] [woman speaking indistinctly on TV] You're about to make love, the phone rings, and what would you do? Number one, "Sorry, I have to get that." Number two, "Pleasure, or..." [woman on phone] Your secretary calling. Number three, "I let the machine answer, -and then decide." -Time to visit your mother. Or number four, "I always disconnect the phone." John? What did you choose? I wonder if Cindy's choice will match. -[trumpet plays fanfare] -Yeah! [Willy] You want to know what I say? I say go to Reno. You hop on a plane, better yet, drive. Drink, gamble, have a good time. You're a free man. Now you can go to Reno, you can do whatever the hell you want to do. Be the ramblin' gambler you want to be. Blackjack's your game. Yeah. Pretty good player too. * [dialing] [line ringing] -[phone rings] -Hello? -Hi, Shirley. It's me. -Oh, Charlie. -Guess where I am? -In the car? Yeah, I'm in the car. Guess where I'm headed? Reno. -Really? -Really. Listen, you know, I was thinkin'. Why don't you hop on a plane, you know? Fly up here and join me. I think it would be really good for us. Maybe even romantic, you know? Charlie, I miss you too, but we've gotta make the best of this. Yeah, whatever. Hey, I'm sorry I bored you again. -Talk to you? -Yeah, I'll talk to you. -Hey, Shirley? -Yeah? Have a merry freakin' Christmas, huh? Bye, Charlie. Spoiled bitch. [birds chirping] [classical music plays] [music distorts on tape] Goddamn it. [cassette fast-forwards] [wheels screech] -[beeping] -[tape rewinds] [tires screech] -What are you doing? -Sorry, man. Sorry? I almost killed us both. I don't know what to tell you. She just crapped out on me. -Are you all right? -I'm fine. Look, we better just get it out of the road before someone gets killed. Yeah, that's a good idea. [grunts] Ho! -Much obliged. -Um, you want to call for a tow? I have a telephone in the car. No. This crate's had it. I wouldn't say no to a ride, though. Yeah, well, I really would much prefer to just let you use my phone. Gee, do you think it'll work in this pass? I'd really appreciate it. All right. Come on. Thanks. I'll just get my stuff. All right. Look, only to the next stop, okay? Oh, sure thing. -Say, listen, my name's Hunter. -Charles Duprey. Sure you want to leave your car behind? Absolutely. [Hunter] Mighty white of you. Pickin' up a stranger, knowin' that it's always a risk. No problem. I'm a guy who prides himself on knowin' the odds. Gambler, are ya? What's your game. -Blackjack. -You any good? -Yeah. -You got a day job? Yeah, I work for a syndication agency. We sell and we distribute comic strips to various newspapers all around the country. You peddle cartoons. Not cartoons, all right. Comic strips. There's a difference. [laughs] Yeah, I guess somebody's gotta do it. -[laughs] -No, man, it's not exactly a punishment, you know. -I actually enjoy it. -Well, sure, why wouldn't you? It's your job. What exactly do you like about it? You know, you ask a lot of questions. I mean, you know, it's like, uh, if you could, you know, elaborate on the job, you know, what you like about it? All right, if you must know, I consider it to be a challenge. Hmm. Really. A challenge, huh? Sellin' cartoons, is it a challenge? You know, I feel like I've just been brought in front of the Spanish Inquisition or something, you know? -What? The Spanish what? -[chuckles] Forget it. It's nice. You got the leather package, I see. Very nice. What's this? Duprey. That's got two words in it. -"Do" and "pray." -You know what? I have an idea. Why don't we talk about something else for a change? Like how about you, for instance? What do you do? -I'm in between. -Yeah. And where are you headed? I'm headed to get some cash from dear old Mother. Mother is a bit of a soft touch. Say, you wouldn't happen to be goin' that far? Uh, Reno? -Would ya? -No, I'm not. [Hunter] No? How long ya been married? -Wedding band. -Twelve years. Twelve years. Twelve years pokin' the same gal. Jesus, Mary and Joseph. You ever regret that? Yeah. Frequently. [laughs] [both laugh] -All the time. -[laughs] [Hunter] Yeah, I hear that. [bird squawking] [Charlie] Shirley. Hello, Charlie. [Charlie] I thought you were at your mom's. -I'm surprised to see you. -I'm surprised to see you too. Let's be strong, okay? [newscaster on radio] ...year old metro girl has a new lease on life, thanks to surgery at the Hospital for Sick Children. Tracy Hooper was given the liver of a nine year-old accident victim in a four-hour operation. Hooper is in critical, but stable... after the operation. Her condition will be monitored for 72 hours to see if there's any sign of rejection. What's that book you're reading? Ah, this philosophy book this guy gave me. Listen to this. "Existence precedes essence." Now, what the hell does that mean? I don't know. But I sure don't like the sound of it. -Yeah. [laughs] I hear that. -[chuckles] Hey, Hunter. Let me ask you somethin'. You ever wonder if there's more? You mean, more to life? What more could there be? Ah, whatever. I guess it's all a bunch of BS anyway, right? I say... life's like a piece of paper. Think of all that goes into makin' that piece of paper. You got your trees, light, air, water, food it takes to feed the guy at the mill, right? And then think of all the things you could do to that piece of paper. You could make a hat, a boat or wipe your nose. You could write a... a poem or a ransom note. And at the end of the day, it's still a fuckin' piece of paper. Yeah. You know... I killed somebody. Well, what do you mean you killed somebody? You mean like a... like a hit and run or somethin'? No, no, no. It was nothin' like that. No. Sorry to say. Fact is, I shoulda known better. I got, uh, hooked up with this crazy girl. Some shit went down. I killed her. You know, the truth is, she's arguably the most miserable person you've ever met in your life, and I probably did her a favor. -Why are you tellin' me this? -'Cause I want to make things right with you. You know? -Do the right thing. -Well, if that's your goal, I mean, have you ever considered maybe callin' the police? Well, to be honest with you, that thought never crossed my mind, no. Hey. It's all right that I confided that in you, huh? I mean, we're cool, right? -Yeah, sure. -Yeah. Listen, uh, I gotta take a leak. * Be right back. [automated voice] The key is in the ignition. -No offense, okay? -None taken. -Fill it up, please. -All right. What a freak. [Shirley] Be strong. [phone rings] Hello. Well, who is this talking? Anything's possible. -How much? -$20. Thanks. Mm-hmm. Excuse me. Who gave you permission to use my phone? Well, I didn't think you'd mind if I'd answer it for you. It's your wife. Hello, Shirley? Yeah, I know, I know. What? Look, I have to call you back, okay? Did you tell my wife that I frequently regret having married her? I don't remember sayin' that. I was just makin' some chit-chat. All right. You know what? I think maybe we ought to just part company right here. -Right here? -Yeah. This is the middle of nowhere. All right, fine. The next town is 30 miles from here. I'll give you a ride that far, but that's it. Let's go. [Hunter] You know I was right. I don't appreciate you talkin' to my wife. * Listen. I betrayed a confidence back there. I'm really sorry, man. Whatever. All right? It doesn't matter. I think it matters. I'd like to balance the books with you. -You know, make it... make it right. -I am not interested. I don't ordinarily borrow money from my mother. I mean, that poor woman, she needs every little bit that she's got. See, she likes playin' those slot machines, right? She's just a fiend for those things. All I want to do is I just want to drive along and enjoy the silence of the road. Okay? All right? I'm not interested. [Hunter] All right, sport. Play it your way. I'll be quiet. * [Hunter] I ain't talkin'. Well, this is it. It's been really nice meetin' you. Hope everything works out -with you and your mom. -What are you talkin' about, man? I don't think really think qualifies as a town. Yeah, I know, but it's... it's a bus depot. -You can get a bus here. -Yeah, but when? Three days from now? I told you, Charlie, I gotta bust a move. Well, why don't we just, you know, go inside, and we'll see when the next bus leaves. I don't think it would hurt to ask. I don't really think I have enough money to pay for a bus ticket. -You know what I'm sayin'? -You know me, I'm a Good Samaritan. I'll help you out. I mean, it's no problem for me. Come on. -That's, uh, Reno, right? -Mm-hmm. [thunder rumbles] -[indistinct radio chatter] -[bell jingles] -Hi. How ya doin'? -I'm goin' to the men's. I, uh, I need to get a bus ticket... [Hunter] What the hell?! Are you kiddin' me? Pay toilets?! I'm sorry. Teenagers. Do I look like a fuckin' teenager? What if I don't have a quarter? What am I supposed to do? Take a shit out in the cactus out there?! What are you getting so excited about? Here. -It's the principle. -I know. But this guy's has nothing to do with it. Besides, in the present circumstances, maybe... Is this gonna cover it, or am I gonna need an extra 25 for the toilet paper? What is wrong with your friend, man? Believe me, you don't want to know. I need to get a one-way ticket to Reno. You guys do have buses to Reno, right? Oh, yeah. You missed one today. We got one at 11:00 am tomorrow. You want the ticket? Yeah. Look, I, um, I left my wallet out in the car. I'll be right back. All right? [bell jingles] Fuck. [Hunter] Hey! Now, who's the dupe, asshole?! [Hunter] Thought we were friends! Dang it! [phone dialing] -[line ringing] -[Shirley] Hello? [Charlie] Hello, Shirley? Charlie, I don't know who that was. -You have to believe... -Or what he meant. Never mind what he said, all right? He's crazy. Please don't start acting like.. Just listen to me, all right? I mean, I gotta call the police on this guy right now. You're not gonna believe it. He said that he killed somebody. -Oh, you're crazy. -I am not crazy. -Well, then you're having a mid-life crisis. -Mid-life crisis, my ass. Fine. Fine. Just read about it in the paper, okay? -Oh, Charlie. -[phone beeps] [dialing] -[operator] May I help you? -Yeah, operator. Uh, get me the local police, please. -What city, please? -Uh, I don't exactly know where I am. Look, listen. This is an emergency, all right? I want to report a murder. -Well, who was killed, sir? -I don't know exactly who was killed. [laughs] Have a good day, sir. Hello? Hello? Shit! * [thunder rumbles] [indistinct police radio chatter] [indistinct police radio chatter] What's goin' on, officer? There was a landslide up on the highway. The road's closed up ahead. You'll have to turn around. I was on my way to Reno. Can you, uh, suggest -maybe an alternate route? -Sorry. Well, what am I supposed to do? Well, I suggest you double back to Devil's Gate and get a nice warm motel room. We're bringin' the bulldozer in first thing in the morning. Road'll be open again by noon. All right. Thanks. Officer? Yes? Um... try and stay warm, all right? I will. [thunder rumbles] [barking] -Hi. -Hi. Can I help you? Yes, I wanted to get a room for one night. One night? No problem. Fill one of these out, please. [music plays softly] [dialing, line rings] -[man] Front desk. -Yeah, it's me. I just checked in. Um, listen, uh, I wanted to know if there's someplace that I could get some food. Someplace that's open now? Well, there's the tavern across the way, but that's about it. All right, thanks. [Christmas music plays] Hello? [woman] Be right there. -Evenin'. -Hi. How are you doing? -What can I get you? -Uh, the manager of the motel, he said that I could get somethin' to eat here. Well, we just have sandwiches. They're pre-packaged. Is that okay? Well, right now, I'm so hungry, I could eat a pine cone if it had some mustard on it. Let's see what we got. You're in luck. Salami or chicken salad? Chicken salad, please. It's kinda quiet around here, huh? We're a full service joint. Thank you. -So where are you headed? -Reno. But the road's closed up ahead. Oh. So I've heard. Hell of a place to get stuck, especially on Christmas Eve. Preachin' to the choir. -Stale? -Yeah. Maybe I should get a beer or somethin' to help wash it down. Thanks. No, thanks. -So how long you lived here? -Too long. Well, you don't sound as if you like it very much. Why don't you move? Civilization and I don't seem to get along. So you're a rugged individualist, huh? Something like that. -So how do you like the motel? -[laughs] Well, let's just say I don't think it's the kind of place that Santa Claus is gonna be slidin' down the chimney tonight. But it, you know, it's okay for a dump. Mmm. Tell me about it. I live there. -Really? -Yep. Room 12. Home sweet home. Well, maybe I'll take you with me, and, uh, take you away from all this. Huh? -You don't need to ask but once. -Really? Really. I gotta finish my side work. It won't take but a few minutes. You gonna be here? Yeah. -Gonna miss me? -Yeah. I'll be back. Find the phone okay? Yeah. Tell you what... Oh, my goodness. Well, the least you could have done was left me my suitcase. Look, I don't want anything to do with you. I'm just gonna walk right out that door right now. -Did I miss something? -Don't try to stop me. You said I could trust you. You lied to me. Hey, you guys know each other? -Ah! -Hey, guys! [grunts] We'll settle this later. Bye. Come again. Hey, are you okay? [whistling Christmas song] [stops whistling] -What's this? -I slipped on a wet spot. I hit my head pretty hard. I guess it just isn't my day, huh? -You sure you're okay? -Yeah, I'm all right. Thanks. What can I do for you, Jim? Uh, just came in for a refill. Hey. You should try to be more careful. -The rain's finally let up. -Yep. [Jim] It's nice, you know, rain. Clears up the air. -Sometimes, it's too much. -Road's still blocked? Uh, yeah. -It's on the house? -Always. -Well, see ya tomorrow. -Okay. You be careful now, you hear? You think we'll see your friend again? -He's not my friend. -Oh. You've got quite a bruise comin' up. Some blood too. We should clean it up. Look, it's closing time. You want to come over to my room, and then I'll fix you up? Okay. Thanks. We're not far. * [woman] We're just around the back here. [Charlie] Okay. Nice of you to do this. [woman] Mm-hmm. Charlie. Charlie. [bells tinkling] Charlie. Charlie. Why don't you come into the light? This is all I got. Ah... Ah. -You're a good sport. -Thanks. Charlie. * [moans] Make yourself at home, Charlie. Thanks. You don't mind if I call you Charlie? Sure. Everybody else does. Come here. Mm... Mm... I want to look into your eyes. Every man and woman is a star. Do you know what that means? Sounds like famous for 15 minutes. [laughs] Not exactly. Charlie, would you like to kiss me? -Yes, I would. -Then why don't you? Mmm... [moaning] -Charlie? -Yeah? Charlie, what are you doing? I was looking for some protection. [both moaning] Oh! The world's oldest Boy Scout. Don't worry about it, huh? -Let's keep it natural. -I'm much better without it. Here. Come on, Charlie. Oh, nice. [Charlie moans] [soft moaning] -[dog barks] -Huh... How was it? It was terrific. How was it for you? Not bad. Can I ask you somethin'? You know, all this stuff up here? Kind of looks like an altar. What is it? None of your business. -It's sacred. -Sacred. What, are you some sort of a witch? I mean, I don't really care. I mean, it's just that some of that stuff is kind of creepy, you know? No, thanks, I quit. Your friend. He was creepy. Who is he, anyway? [dog barking] I told you he's not my friend. Just some nut I picked up hitchhiking. From the moment I saw him, there was something about him. You can see the future? Afraid so. It doesn't sound very good. Not for me. What about for me? You're gonna be fine. But stay away from your wife. She's not to be trusted. * [thunder crashes] [man whispers] Charlie. Hello? Zeena? Jesus. [moans, laughs] Guess you're glad you used a rubber, huh? I'd better go. You owe me $50. What do you mean, $50? For what? Oh, Charlie. You don't think I fucked you for the fun of it, do you? I need that money, Charlie. Thank you. Come again. [laughs] [dog barks] Bitch. [barking] -Oh. -[barking] All right. All right. [man] Devil's Gate Hotel. Yes, we do. We got plenty of rooms. [singing indistinctly] -[bell jingles] -[man] Yes, sir. Can I help you? [Hunter] You can if you got a room. [man] That'll be 28... What are you doing? [Hunter] Shut up! Sit down over there and shut up! [rattling] [speaking indistinctly] [TV plays indistinctly] -[barking] -[bell jingles] [TV plays indistinctly] [barking] [TV continues] -[thunder crashes] -[dog barking] [breath exhales] [gasps] [screams] [Hunter shouts] [screams] -[groaning, sobbing] -It looked like that hurt. -Did it? -[sobbing] Well, this is gonna hurt a lot. Please don't! [screams] [Shirley on answering machine] Hi, you've reached the Dupreys. -Leave a message at the tone. -[tone beeps] Hello, Shirley? It's me. Yeah, pick up the phone, huh? Look, I know you're there. Just pick up the phone. Look, we either settle this thing tonight, or that's gonna be it, all right? Pick up the phone! All right, fine. [bangs phone down] That's it. I'm outta here. Oh, shit. My glasses. -[knocks on door] -Hello? -[knocks] -Hello, Zeena? Zeena? Hey, Zeena? You all right in there? [dog barks] [dog barking] -[dialing] -[coughs] -[line rings] -[operator] 911. I want to report a murder. It's a woman. Her name is Zeena. She works over at the tavern. Hang up the phone, Charlie. -Go on. Hang up. -Hello? -[phone beeps] -How could you? Oh, come on, Charlie. It was easy. Yeah, to rob somebody of their life, that doesn't mean anything to you? Well, I guess you would say that I'm indifferent. You just think you're better than everybody else. I am better. I'm stronger. And I'm freer. -You're crazy. -Well, that may be so. But that's not for me to judge. Anyway, I had to kill her. She fraternized with you, and you're a witness. -A witness to what? -Remember that bit about, "Existence precedes essence?" I think I figured out what that meant. You ask the universe, "What did I do to deserve this?" And the universe answers back... "Nothin'." So what the hell does that got to do with anything? * [grunting] [dog barking] Hey! -Hey! -[banging] I need some help! Hey! [coughs] [barking] -[Hunter screams] -[snarling] [shouting] [dog yelps] -Charlie! -[car horn honks] [horn honks] [phone beeps] [dialing, line rings] -[operator] 911. -Look, I need your help, please. -How can I... -Look, don't talk, all right? -[phone beeps] -I'm in a lot of trouble. This guy, he's tryin' to kill me. -[phone beeps] -I need your help. -I need you to come... -[static] Hello? I'm sick to death of talking. You bore me. -[indistinct] -[screams] [birds chirping] [sighs] [vehicle approaching] Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop! Stop! Shit. Whoa! Take it easy, man. You're gonna give yourself hypertension carrying on like that. I don't mind tellin' you, Charlie. Siccin' that dog on me was an asshole move, buddy. Fuck you, you psycho bastard. Asshole. I don't like stayin' up nights like this. You know what I mean? Actually, I'm kind of a morning person. Nice cut, Charlie. [grunting] [gasping] Well, that felt pretty good. You're never gonna get away with killin' me. -Oh, yeah. Why is that? -'Cause I phoned Shirley from the woods last night. She knows everything about you. And by now, I'm sure that the law does too. -Really? -Yeah. You kill me, and it's just another reason for them to fry you. -We should make a deal. -[laughs] -What's so funny? -You are, Charlie boy. I talked to Shirley last night, not you. She don't give a shit about you, man. She wants you dead. -What are you talking about? -She paid me to kill you. And near as I can figure, you're sittin' on some kind of fat insurance policy. You're a fuckin' liar. She would never do that. She... she couldn't. I'm not gonna argue with you. Maybe she couldn't. But Old Willy Boy sure could. Don't you work with that guy or somethin'? I mean, think about it, man. Didn't he have to persuade you to come up here? -[thunder crashes] -I say go to Reno. Now, I don't know this for a fact, but I think he's fuckin' your woman. Actually, it was Willy that first contacted me. We met over in that bar you all hang out at. I'll have it taken care of. No worries. You could say Willy cocked the trigger, but old Shirley, she sure as shit pulled it. It was her decision, man. She gave the order. So you see, there is a cause and effect in this universe. Well, I guess we got a little change in the plan. You were supposed to get whacked by that hitchhiker. Now it's gonna have to be "cartoon salesman murdered by serial killer." It's just as well. How much are they paying you? -Six G's. -I'll double it. No, man. I don't take no American Express. -[grunts] -Ah! Oh, man, tiger! Look at you go! You got no quit in you. You and I aren't all that different. You and I, we're nothin' alike. [indistinct police radio chatter] [whispers] Be quiet. * Hey, you! Hands. Put 'em on the bar. Now. Don't make me ask you again. -Thank God you're here. -Hold it right there. -What? -You're both under arrest. What do you mean I'm under arrest? This guy's been tryin' to kill me. He's already killed two... Ah! Oh! You're both under arrest... ...for breaking and entering. -It's 'cause we're black, isn't it? -Where's Zeena? -Who's Zeena? -The woman who runs the place. Oh, yeah. What happened to her? She went home with you, didn't she? You fucked her, didn't you? That was your little prophylactic -I saw in the waste can, wasn't it? -[both shouting] -Help me! -Shut up! -Don't listen to him! -He's dangerous! -That guy's crazy! -You have no idea -what this guy is capable of doing! -Shut up! -Please, God, don't leave me! -Shut up! -He killed a woman back in LA two days ago! -Sir, shut up! -Shoot him! -Shut up! -Shoot him! -Sir, shut up! -Please... -Do it! -Remain calm, sir! -You have no idea what he's been saying to me! -Sir! -Shoot him! Shut up! Sir! [all shouting] [gunshots] Jesus. Thank God. Shit. All the goddam vehicles in the world, I gotta pick the one on "empty." -[siren wailing] -Shit. [siren wailing] I gotta think of someone who's seen me. [indistinct police radio chatter] Yeah, that guy at the bus depot. -Oh, shit! -[tires squealing] [siren wailing] Damn! -Ah! Shit! -[police radio silences] Holy shit, man! You okay? Now, you just lay still, all right? Can you help me? This guy is... he tried to kill me. He's already killed some other people. Do you have a gun? No. Look, just take it easy. This guy's fucking crazy, man. -[tires screeching] -[siren wails] [man] What the fuck was that? You know where the driver of this vehicle is? Yeah, he took off. Went up the hill. What'd he do? Looks like he killed a barmaid in town. Come on, gentlemen. I'm gonna need your help. * All right. Let's split up. We'll fan out. [grunting] [grunts] Ah! Ahh! * [bird chirping] [wind howling] -[door creaking open] -[gasps] [Charlie] Hey. How you feelin'? Pretty shitty, I hope. -Let's make a deal. -God, that's pathetic. What makes you think I'd want to make a deal with you? I'll help you get revenge on Willy. Get your wife back for you. Well, what makes you think that I'd want to have my wife back? [coughs] You know, it's a funny thing. Yesterday, I was a beaten man, in a slump, goin' nowhere. Scared of bein' alone. Scared of the future. But you know what? I'm not scared anymore. And the irony of the whole thing is... is I have you to thank. [chuckles] I mean, hell. I mean, I never even was in a fight before I met you. You know? I mean, I was always scared of the pain. I got a few dinks, a few bruises. It's not so bad. In fact, I feel pretty good. Invigorated. Yeah, you helped me realize that I'm strong, and I have never been as free. And you know why? Because I'm a survivor. Of course, wherever there's a survivor, there's always a victim, and that's where you come in. Is your name really Hunter? That's good. Because I like it. And I think I'm gonna use it from now on. But, of course, that makes it logical that you're gonna assume my identity. Can you picture it? "Cartoon salesman murdered." I mean, I know it's tough playing the dead body, but somebody's gotta do it. You know, I've never even held one of these babies in my hand before. Hm? It's got some weight. Feels good. Hell, I don't even know if... if I can even shoot it right. Well, here goes. -[grunts] -[gunshot] * [grunts] Oh! Quit fuckin' around! * -Finish it. -With pleasure. [gunshot] Now, Mr. Duprey. [laughs] [TV playing indistinctly] [TV continues] [Shirley] Willy? Willy? -[man on TV] Nice shot. -Goddamn it, Shirley. -What is it? -Could you check the mail? -Yeah, in a minute. -No, now. I want to see if the check from the insurance company's here. [sighs] If you say so. [phone rings] -Hello? -[slot machines ringing over phone] Hello? Hello? Who is this? Ooh! [man on TV] Puts him 100 par from the hole. And Thompson is still up by one stroke. -Did it come? -No, but we got something else. Ooh. What is it? I said, what is it? Hold your horses. It's a package addressed to both of us. Well, that's strange. So, what is it already? -[beeping] -Oh, shit! [explosion] Blackjack. Blackjack again. What's your secret? Thanks. Killer instinct. *
