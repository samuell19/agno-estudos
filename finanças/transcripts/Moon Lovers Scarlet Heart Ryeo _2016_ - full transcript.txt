Subtitles by DramaFever [This drama has taken a creative license to history.] [Episode 1] Mister. Have you ever wanted to sleep for a hundred or a thousand years? Everything keeps going wrong and you don't see any hope of it getting better. You tell yourself, "I'm sure things will get better." Then another thing goes wrong. I would just prefer... to fall asleep and never wake up again. I want to forget everything. But it's not working. That jerk who left me with a pile of debt. That wench who fooled me and ran off with him. Gosh... I should never have trusted anyone. Mister, you know what? I thought that if I didn't change the people I trusted and liked wouldn't change either. I was wrong, though. How did my life end up this way? Your life can't change just because you want it to. Maybe if you died and came back to life again. What? Oh no. Hey, Mister! No. No, no. I'm sure someone else saw. By the time I go in there, someone else will have saved him. Ha Jin, you don't need to. No, you don't. Even if you don't, someone else will... Gosh! Why is it me again! Eun Yool! Honey, it's our Eun Yool! Eun Yool, Eun Yool! Eun Yool, wait! Eun Yool! - Grab my hand. - Okay. Grab on to me. Hold on. How could you do this to me? Are you crazy? [Goryeo, Songak (Kaesong)] It's the wolf dog! The wolf! The wolf dog. [4th Prince Wang So] - Hurry, let's go! - Okay, I'm coming. [10th Prince Wang Eun] [14th Prince Wang Jung] Jung. Brother! [3rd Prince Wang Yo] [13th Prince Baek Ah] [8th Prince Wang Wook] [9th Prince Wang Won] Brother, feel this. Do you see this definition here? Jung, I'll be going now. Eun, wait for me. Eun! Brother. Is our fourth brother not here yet? He should come bathe if he is to attend the spiritual ritual. Has he ever done things our way? Do not bother with him. It's too much of a pain. Don't you know how Wook is? He is always worrying about others. Wang So was the only one born in the same year I was. I should at least take care of him. This is the first time So will be attending the spiritual ritual, right? I wonder if His Majesty has a specific reason for telling him to come. Use steam and make sure to get all the wrinkles out. Baek Ah. Did you hear that our fourth brother massacred his family out in Shinju? They say it was very brutal, like a wolf killing people. You can't believe all the rumors like that. All the criminals in the nation don't even talk about things like that. All our visitors from Shinju say so. It must be true. It is merely a rumor. How can he take down a local government on his own? What about the local army? Even good martial arts skills would not suffice. Also, So has never had a master who taught him to fight. Jung, you and So have the same mother. You never know when you'll turn into a wolf too. Shut your mouths. Then, I am born from the same womb as our fourth brother. Am I not a person, as well? His jokes were too harsh. I will speak to him later on. Please don't take it to heart. 4th Prince So will be returning to Shinju once the spiritual ritual is over. If the king hears about any nonsense, I will not stand idly by. Do you understand? Brothers, should we make a bet on who can float the longest? Let's go to the outer pool. Eun, that's enough. I said that's enough. If you give me just one chance, I can get him to be quiet. It's fine. Brothers! Come quickly. Jung, come now. What is this place? I must be alive. What a relief. What a total relief! Hey! You... you... What are you doing here? Why is there a girl... Brothers, brothers! Brothers, brothers, brothers! Lady, lady. - Me? - What is it? Brothers! It's a girl! It's a girl! A girl! - Lady! - A girl! Is anyone there? Hey, stop right there. Stop! You dare to spy on the princes? Hae Soo? What do we do now? You're in trouble. Hurry, Lady. We need to go. This is not the time for this. Hurry. What are we going to do? Faster. Goodness... You didn't come outside for so long. I knew something was wrong. The princes had starting bathing and I couldn't even go looking for you. This is just insane. Hurry up. Let's go. You're feeling okay now, aren't you? Lady? Princes? This is strange. How did I end up here? - Let's go. - Wait. I... Do you know me? What? This doesn't look like the park. What am I doing here? La... Lady! What do you mean you don't know where this is? This is the largest washing area in Songak. What is this? I really am dead. So, this place is... the afterlife? Lady Soo! [Goryeo Palace] Open the door! I will leave a servant with you, Prince. Once the ritual is over, do not delay and return to Shinju. You are also an adopted member of our Kang household, so do not forget. Please uphold our family name in the king's presence. An adopted member? And here I thought I was your hostage this entire time. You cannot use your sword inside the palace. Shall I prepare a horse for your return? I won't be going back. I won't be going back. I won't be letting myself return to Shinju as a hostage. Soo! You are finally awake. Are you still in a lot of pain? Did I get very hurt? Don't even bring it up. You fell so hard. I thought your head would burst. Do you know how worried Lady Hae was? - Hae Soo. - By the way... Why do you keep calling me Hae Soo? My name is Go Ha Jin. What? Why are you calling me "Hae Soo" or "Lady"? I don't understand why I'm being called these things. Ah, right. I died. You didn't die. You nearly did. I'm not dead? It wasn't a dream. If I'm not dead... where am I? Soo! Soo. Get the doctor now. Yes, Lady. Where is this place? No, no... who am I? Are you unable to remember at all? Your name is Hae Soo. Hae Soo. I'm your sixth cousin, Myung Hee. Hae Soo? I'm Hae Soo? I'm not... inside another person's body, am I? Think about it carefully. Take a close look at me. You are in Songak right now. This is the home of the 8th Prince Wang Wook. Songak, you say? Then, this is Goryeo? Goguryeo, Baekje, Silla, and Goryeo... that Goryeo? Do you remember now? Yes, it is that Goryeo. Then, right now... who is the king? It is His Majesty who founded this land, of course. His Majesty who founded Goryeo... It can't be... Taejo Wang Geon? This is the bird that ate the Crown Prince's breakfast today. This happened even before it could swallow the first bite. It was great luck that the Crown Prince skipped his meal because he was not hungry. [Taejo Wang Geon] Why is there no response? Catch the person who tried to kill the Crown Prince. [Wang Shik Ryeom] We should figure out why it happened. What would change just because we catch the culprit? Minister Wang Shik Ryeom, what is it you are trying to say? Is the Crown Prince acting like a Crown Prince? [Crown Prince - 1st Prince Moo] At the assembly meeting he only received greetings from the foreign envoys and left. He is either on the battlefield or visiting all known hot springs. Did you know that there is a rumor that the Crown Prince has an incurable illness? Therefore I, Wang Shik Ryeom, am making a request you. Please depose the 1st Prince Moo as Crown Prince. I entreat you to name a new Crown Prince. Do you all agree with him? Speak up. Who among you do you think will suit the position if not the current Crown Prince? Please withdraw those words, Your Majesty. There is no one among us who wishes to become Crown Prince. That is true, Your Majesty. Please withdraw your words. Yes, please withdraw them. Please withdraw your words, Your Majesty! Astronomer Choi Ji Mong. Loyal subject Choi Ji Mong will relay the will of the heavens to all of you here. Crown Prince Wang Moo's star is a royal star in the sky. It is the first star of the five northern stars and it shines brighter every day. It shines brighter along with the king's shining palace of Goryeo. This means that he is not lacking as the Crown Prince. It has been 24 years since this land has been founded. The 1st Prince Wang Moo fought with me in many wars. He laid the foundation for this nation. Choi Ji Mong. During this spiritual ritual Wang Moo will chase away the evil spirits. Prepare for it with great detail. Yes, Your Majesty! [Queen Yoo] That is true. The Crown Prince is very lucky. He has a very long life. We have only made him more aware and vigilant now. It is the court lady. Tell him I do not want to see anyone. It has been two years since the 4th Prince has come. If you could just meet him-- I am not well right now. Who would dare to disturb the queen? [4th Prince So] What about my mother? Queen Yoo has fallen asleep, as she is very ill. Perhaps you should come back another time. I died back then. This girl Hae Soo must have drowned and died in the water too. Then, am I Go Ha Jin or am I Hae Soo? I don't know how I managed to get to Goryeo and into this body. Try to be positive. You have a chance here. A chance to avoid death, and live. You're really lucky here. Okay, so don't get caught and just get through this. If you get through this... If you get through this... I'm not Hae Soo, so I'll get caught. What do I do? - Lady! - Soo. Come out and talk. Please come outside. Lady, please open the door. What are you planning on doing? What kind of world is out there? I'm scared. I'm scared to death. I don't even know anything about Goryeo. King Taejo is the founder of Goryeo. After Taejo... After Taejo... Why are you being like this? Gwangjong? [8th Prince Wook] Lady. Lady. What is going on? - It's Lady Soo! - Hae Soo? She fell into the water and didn't come out for two hours. According to the doctor... she stopped breathing. Then, are you saying Soo died? She died and came back. Maybe that's why she lost all her memories and doesn't even know her name. I'm worried that she will do something dangerous, at this rate. Soo, do not be afraid. I brought you to this place. So... I will help you until the very end. You brought me to this place? Avoiding this will not change anything. You have to be strong. Won't you trust me and come outside? I can't go back anymore. And I can't change the way things are now. Then, I want to live! I want to do whatever I can to survive and live. I want to live. What do you mean, a wife? - Your Majesty! - Move. [Younger So, Crown Prince Moo] Your Majesty. I will die. Our first-born son has died. How can you get married? How can you marry at a time like this? South Goryeo is in danger. This marriage is the way to deflect that danger. Before you are a ruler, you are the father of my children. Are you not sad? Does your heart not feel torn? Don't you wish you could die and bring back your child? There are lives at stake. King. If that is all you care about... why should we bother living anymore? Mother. Do you choose to marry, or do you choose your son? - Queen! - Choose. Is it Goryeo or your son's life? Put down that knife. You cannot stop my marriage by doing this. You really are something. You really are. If I do not have your whole heart, I do not need it. So! So! Is anyone out there? Have you brought me here to be one of the Crown Prince's men? I don't know if you will be a shield for the Crown Prince... or a sword out to get him. [8th Prince Wook's Residence] You always liked playing arrows, so you would make bets and play. And that tree sapling over there? We planted it together. You're really good at playing shuttlecock. Okay, so I like throwing arrows and shuttlecock. I'm here to nurse and keep my sixth cousin company. That's right. My name is Hae Soo. You're my servant, Chae Ryung. Right? I think I'm starting to remember now. You're using honorifics with me. Really... What's wrong with you, Lady? Oh yeah. I forgot. Chae Ryung, don't you worry. Why is that? Do you remember? I think I do but maybe I don't. You really don't need to worry. I'm the type of person who learns one thing and picks up 10 other things. I'll keep trying. Is it really true that you don't remember anything? It's just the two of us. You can tell me. - You're lying, right? - What? The prince and his wife don't know. I've been by your side every day. What is this really about? Did you have a rendezvous with a gentleman from another household? Or do you have a lot of debt? Is Hae Soo this kind of girl? So, does she pretend to be a good girl but then she goes out to meet men at night? She's not that bad. But why are you speaking like you're talking about another person? Oh! You really must be injured. I should keep my mouth shut. They'll say I'm crazy if I say I'm not Hae Soo. - Chae Ryung. - Yes. There is another girl inside of me. Never mind. No need to die twice. I was just kidding. Chae Ryung. I have no wrinkles around my mouth, right? What? Oh my! Oh! Oh! She is so nice and firm. I haven't been in this great of shape in a long time. Oh, my word. She took great care of herself in Goryeo even though they just ate vegetables. Oh... oh, Lady. She is very severely injured. There are positives to being alive again. [Cheomseongdae Palace] Wow! Take a look at this. What is this? What is it? Ji Mong, Ji Mong! 10th Prince! This is a plane. Plane? What is that? It is a tool used to fly in the sky like a bird. Someday, your children will have children. Those children will have their own children. People will use this to go to foreign lands and travel. Wow! Ji Mong is always making amazing things. You're always staring up at the sky. You're saying strange things more often. What you said about the star of the Crown Prince... is that even the truth? That's what I wanted to say. The person who knows the will of the heavens is a subject of the Crown Prince. Everyone in Goryeo knows that. I read the skies for a living. Do you think I would lie? Then, Ji Mong. What is my fortune? If you get mine right, I'll assume you were correct earlier. The day of the 13th Prince's birth was when Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter were all in alignment, right? That's how great men were in the past. You have quite the luck with the females. What? Are there no other men? Even I can guess that. Who doesn't know that girls all over Songak fall over themselves for Baek Ah? If that's all you're doing, our 3rd brother has great fortune in governing. - Our 9th brother has luck in wealth. - Yes. Our 8th brother has blessings in high intelligence. My 10th brother has... My 10th brother doesn't really-- I have the younger brother blessing. - Hey! - You little... I feel a little hurt. You always enjoyed my stories before. Now you don't believe me? That was when we were young. We're all grown up now. We won't be fooled by you any longer. Yes, you are all adults now. I won't be able to persuade you all with my words alone. Eun, he says we're all grown up. I'm not finished growing yet. It's all right. You're big in other areas. His heart and consideration for others. Yeah, that's true. About our fourth brother... I heard he's in the palace. Why hasn't he come to say hello to you? You heard about how he killed the horse he rode in on, right? I heard that the officers who saw are having nightmares. They all took the day off. Why did he do such a thing? Being the way he is, I would refuse his greeting if he came. He is probably suffering more than anyone. Don't be like that. He is your brother. It's been a long time. Yes. Oh! Eun! Are you all right? Was it just me who couldn't breathe? I don't know. Chae Ryung. What is the 8th Prince like? I just can't remember. He is the best man in all of Goryeo. He's just as well educated as any scholar out there. He is a man of good character, the best of all 25 princes. Many believe that the Crown Prince should not be the 1st Prince. They believe it should our prince. Is he Gwangjong? They look like they have a great relationship. Of course. He is so caring and considerate of his sick wife. She trusts him and would follow him anywhere. Everyone is so envious. I suppose I felt I could trust him too. This is disrespectful. We would like to greet you, Princess. Lady. You should greet Princess Yeon Hwa. This woman is a princess? Sure, there are princes. Of course there's a princess. Leave her be. I heard she lost her memory. However, it seems she lost her manners too. What shall we do? I suppose it would not hurt for you to learn from the very beginning. She likes to put people down in a strange, roundabout way. You should not be looking at what a married couple is doing. I will deal with it harshly if it happens again even if you are her cousin. Do you understand? Those crooked eyes and mouth. Look how tense her hand looks. I've been through all sorts of crap before and this right here... If you don't like me, just say so. - What did you say? - I can tell just by looking. You're trying to look for a reason to pick on me in order to set me straight. That doesn't work on me. I have been through this a lot. What is this girl saying to me? Forgive her, Princess. Lady Soo is not of sound mind yet. Are you saying I'm crazy? No, that's not it. You wench. You dare act that way in this household? Wench? What is all this commotion? Brother. You must have forgotten how to greet people since your injury. Ah... hi. Hello. Hello, Prince... They say you do not remember anything. Then, you must not recognize me either. I heard that you're the 8th Prince. You heard that? Then, did you spy on the princes bathing before or after you lost your memory? Oh, that... I don't really remember. All right, then what do you plan on doing now? I will allow you to do whatever you wish to do. What? When my wife brought you here, I planned on watching over you. You can receive more treatment or go back to your hometown. It may be difficult to live here since you do not remember. - I'll help you set up a small place. - Why? What do you mean, why? I'm the one who got hurt. Why would you take care of me? Ah... because I'm your wife's cousin. But, still... it's not in my personality to take handouts from people. I'll handle it. Hand... handouts? I'm having trouble understanding you. What is the term you're using? And you... Anyway, I'm going to get through it and stay in this house. I can't remember anything, so I can't go anywhere else. Lady Hae, Chae Ryung, and you are here. You're all being very kind and I think I can get through it here. There isn't anything that I can't do. I'm very smart. So, I'm a very fast learner. You'll know once you see me. I will become someone you need in this household. I'll do my best to learn everything. I won't be a burden to you, Prince. You... seem like a different person. We were never close. The way you talk and your actions. You're a different person. It does not matter to me. What? I won't press you further about whether or not you remember or if you spied on the princes. You must not make Lady Hae worry. All right? Yes, Prince Wook. You may leave. I'll work very hard from now on. "Get through it"? That's the latest book. Do you want to borrow it? Why did you ask to see me? The servant who served the Crown Prince his breakfast was found hanging from a noose. The assassination was covered up by a suicide. Doesn't that mean the culprit must be a royal family member? Particularly, one of the princes. Find the culprit. Find the culprit? Am I a dog? People keep calling me a wolf dog. Now you really think I'm a dog. Did you have fun killing that horse? You want to stop living as some hostage and live in Songak, right? This will give you that chance, Prince. Take that chance when you have it. Look at me. I said the king would realize his dream of unifying the Three Han states. Now look where I am. Don't use those tricks on me. I'm not that little kid who liked it when you used to come find me. Do not think of playing me. It's what the Crown Prince wants. We received a tip that there is a plan to kill the Crown Prince during the ritual. Oh... You want me to pretend to be you? Then, what will you promise to me in return? How about you catch the culprit too? Then I will do whatever you ask. I will live in Songak. Every year, our home had the most beautiful lotus lanterns, thanks to you. It will be hard this year. It must be because my wound hasn't healed. My hand is not doing what I want it to. What can we do? You're not doing it on purpose. You should rest. Go on out. No. I shouldn't rest alone. I'll do whatever is necessary. Give me work to do. How great of you to offer. Then, Chae Ryung. Show your lady where you go to mix the glue. You can help out with that, right? Of course, it's not a big deal. Oh... that Princess Yeon Hwa or whatever... She acted like she was thinking of me. That awful... Gosh, how long do I have to do this for? I know how to do skincare. Massages and makeup. I have a truckload of licenses. But look at me here. I'm like dog food. Oh no! What am I going to do? I knew this would happen. Princess Yeon Hwa gave me the important task of making this glue. You said you would learn everything and get through it. It looks like you are doing very well. You are quite the amazing person. Where's So? When is he coming? It's his first time, so we should practice. The 4th Prince will arrive soon. I heard that when the ritual is over... there is a rumor the king will be abdicating the throne to the Crown Prince. What? Is there really a rumor like that? Oh my! I have never heard such a thing. Even if it were true, the king would never tell me. I'm merely the astronomer. I need to go see the Crown Prince about his role in the ritual. Why don't you all keep practicing? My goodness! You shouldn't have done that. What if the king hears about it? You did a thoughtless thing. He wasn't the only one who was curious. Don't blame him too much. Choi Ji Mong did not say it wasn't true. It's the dog! The wolf dog! It's the wolf! It's the wolf! Subtitles by DramaFever [Scarlet Heart: Ryeo] You must avoid the 4th Prince as soon as you see him. Did you see? Aren't you the one who spied on us taking a bath? It's not me! You hit the prince, the son of our king. It's another prince? You won't be able to avoid punishment. Another chance like this won't come again. You must kill him. Protect the king! Catch him. I know that it was a clear attack on me and it was a significant foe. Make your decision now. Please save me.
