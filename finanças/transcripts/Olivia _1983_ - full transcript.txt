It had neither stairs nor a door And only one little window just at the top. Rapunzel would look out her window and dream of all the wonderful things outside. After a few years had passed, it happened that a handsome prince was walking by the river. He heard a song so lovely that he stopped to listen. (door knocking) (distant boat horn blowing) (door thudding) - [Man] My name's Alex. Met you last night at the bridge. - [Woman] Oh, right. Come in, Alex.

(dog whimpering) - I'm getting tired of being in the house all day. It's not a bad job. I could make some money for us. - Listen, I'm not having my wife waiting on tables, all right? - You don't want me to do anything. (somber music) - Mommy, can't you read me another story? (mother shushing) - Not now. You're supposed to be in bed. Now get in there and be quiet! (boat horn blowing) (distant seagulls squawking) - Hey, love, I'm off again. - [Olivia] Here's your lunchbox. - Give me a kiss. - So, Richard, are we going to Brighton for the weekend? - We'll have to wait and see. - We haven't been to the coast in ages. - Listen, I've got to go, Olivia. We'll talk about it later, all right? (distant boat horn blowing) - When Rapunzel was 16 years old, the evil sorcerer shut her up in a tower which stood alone at the river and had neither stairs nor door and only one small window just at the top. After a couple of years had passed, it happened that the king's son was riding through the wood and came by the tower. There, he heard a song so beautiful-- - [Mother] That he stood still and listened. It was Rapunzel, who to pass the lonely time away, was singing to herself. Happy birthday. (eerie music) Here you are, all alone. Only your mommy is with you. Have you forgotten what happened to your mommy? What you saw through the key hole? (Olivia crying) Why didn't you help your mommy? Perhaps you didn't love her. (wind howling) (Olivia whimpering) Or did you? Don't worry, Olivia. Mommy will forgive you. Just listen to your mommy and do as she says and you'll never be alone again.

(ominous music) - I'd like to see what's hiding behind those glasses. How are you tonight? So shall we go? - [Mother] Go with him, baby. (sinister music) - After you, my dear. I'd like you to meet some friends of mine. These ladies keep good company. Sometimes when I'm alone at night I take one of them into my bed. In fact, you can't imagine how jealous the other two get. You might think they aren't alive. - But they have more real emotions than a lot of us. Is that what you want to say? - Nice way to put it. Would you like to smoke a joint? Or what about some coke? - No thanks. - Why, are you in a hurry? Most of the girls that come here would like to stay all night. Cash is no problem. Somehow, I don't know, I have a pretty good instinct. - What about? - You're not an old pro, are you? I don't want to hurt your feelings or anything but-- - What's your name? - Eric. - Well, Eric, how would you like it? - Anything you can think of. I think I've seen you before.

You want me to beg you? - No. - So this is maybe some kind of game I haven't played before? - Maybe. - Are there specific rules I should know? (sinister music) This is crazy. But I like it. What's wrong? Why are you staring at me? I get you. You want to punish me. Right? That's interesting. You're the first one who understands me. You know what I need, don't you? Yes you do. Oh, come on. Come on. Hit me. Hit me. (Eric moaning) (ominous music) - [Mother] Now you can show mommy how much you love her. (sinister music) (Olivia whimpering) (Olivia crying) (traffic whooshing) - The most important question facing us today concerns the restoration, or the demolition, of London Bridge. I would like to introduce to you Mr. Michael Grant. Representing the SELCO Corporation of Los Angeles. We've contracted them to investigate and make a report on the future of our bridge. Mr. Grant. - Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to express the gratitude of our corporation for the opportunity of working with you on this historic landmark. - When can we expect to receive your recommendations for the restoration, or the demolition, of the bridge? - I'll give you a preliminary report on the restoration possibilities in three days.

Who is Harold? - My dog. - Now I think I remember you. The first night on the bridge. You have a mutt, black and white sorta. - Yeah, I walk him under the bridge every night. - You look different. - [Olivia] Where do you live in America? - In Los Angeles. I used to live around the Great Lakes but I couldn't take those cold winters. - Are you married? - No. Move around too much. - What do you do? - Oh, I take care of things that fall apart. - Oh, I guess we could use you here. - What for? - To fix up the bridge. - Oh yeah.

So, Mr. Grant, what have you to report to us? - Oh, Well, things are coming along very well. I've looked the bridge over thoroughly and I assure you it can be renovated at a reasonable cost. - I see. Well, do you have any figures you can give us? - Well, I would say definitely under a million. - A million pounds? - Dollars. - Oh. (people chuckling) When can you give us a more exact figure, in pounds? - Well, it's just a matter of working it out. I will have the exact figures for you in 24 hours. - I'd appreciate that very much, Mr. Grant. (dramatic cinema music) - [Man In Movie] My mother always said, you can't win playing cards but you can't lose anything by cutting them. - [Man In Movie] I just dropped in to say goodbye. - [Man In Movie] Hmmm? - [Man In Movie] Yeah, my bags are all packed. I'm leaving right away. - [Man In Movie] He's always leaving. - [Man In Movie] Pleasure, kid. - [Man In Movie] Well, it's nice to know he will. Goodbye, Grant. - [Man In Movie] Goodbye again, son. - [Man In Movie] Goodbye now. (dramatic cinema movie) - [Man In Movie] You! Just what do you expect a man to do? I've apologized, I've crawled. I've had just about enough. I'll give you just 90 seconds to make up your mind. I'll be at the bar. Just 90 seconds! - I didn't listen to my mother for many years.

Did you hear that? - What? - A noise outside. - Only the wind. Picks up at night at this time of year in the desert. (sinister music) - Hey. Did your mother tell you to move to Arizona and start a new life under a new name? - I wanted to get away from everything. I didn't know where to go until they moved the bridge. Now sleep, don't ask me any more questions. - You're right. Now is what's important. The past is passed. (birds chirping) (water trickling) - Yes, but I know what I'm doing. Yes, I understand.
