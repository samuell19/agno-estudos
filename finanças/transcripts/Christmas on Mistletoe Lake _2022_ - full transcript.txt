Not only does it have a history,\Nbut you will be hard-pressed To ever do better than\Nthe craftsmanship that's been Put into it. I admire your principles, But I think you\Nshould reconsider. A deal like this could set up\Nyou and your business for life. With all due respect,\NI don't think redesigning One boat will\Nset me up for life. I'm not talking about the boat. You know, the entire\Nharbor is for sale, right? Yes, I mean, unfortunately,\NI don't have that kind of money. But I just got off\Na conference call With a group of investors. They want to come in\Nand totally revamp the harbor, Put in a resort,\Nexcavate the lake to Bring in bigger boats,\Nmore waterfront restaurants. Even a big-box store. Who would want to do that?

You kids have fun. (chuckling) ♪ This boat doesn't feel like home Just because of\Nthe way you decorated it. From the moment\Nyou step foot on it, Your very presence made\Nit feel like it was home. I feel the exact same way. My whole life, I have craved This feeling of being at home. From the moment I met you\Nand emma, I knew that I was. You're not bad for a city girl. (laughing) Well, a country boy like you\Ncan do a whole lot worse. (both laughing) By the way,\Nwhat is your middle name? Do we really know each other\Nwell enough for that? I think we do. Ignatius. (laughing) Ignatius? You see why I didn't\Nwant to tell you. I don't know. Iggy mistletoe is a pretty\Nstellar soap opera name.
