Daddy, you are late. We have to leave. "Now is the winter of our discontent. Made glorious summer by this sun of York. But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks, nor made to court an amorous looking-glass. I, that am rudely stamped, and want love's majesty to strut before a wanton ambling nymph. I, that am curtailed of this fair proportion. Deformed, unfinished, sent before my time into this breathing world scarce half made up. And that so lamely and unfashionable That dogs bark at me as I halt by them. Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace have no delight to pass away the time. Unless to spy my shadow in the sun and descant on mine own deformity. Since I cannot prove a lover, to entertain these fair well-spoken days I am determined to prove a villain, and hate the idle pleasures of these days. Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous, by drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams to set my brother Clarence and the king in deadly hate the one against the other. And if King Edward be as true and just as I am subtle, false, and treacherous this day should Clarence closely be mewed up about a prophecy which says that G of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be. Dive, thoughts, down to my soul." Five minutes until the end of the play. Actors please get ready for curtain call. "A horse. A horse. My kingdom for a horse." That scene we talked about, it turned out very well. They're not picking up. Why the hell did you stretch out the second part? I should've been at the recording studio already. Yavka, what you laughing at? I asked you to cut the acting a little shorter. But no, you can't do that. You acted like there was no tomorrow. Big deal. Excuse me, is this a good time? I just wanted to congratulate you, you were amazing. Thanks. -You too. -Hah, thank you. We've been doing this play for five years. What would we be, if not amazing? Yes, it's a pity this was the last time. What do you mean, the last time? Richard III. And you know this how? The manager told me. Bravo. That's some good news. We were going to retire on that play. How are you, sweetie? I'll be performing with you in Uncle Vanya. Sonia? Yes. I'm so happy we'll be acting together. I'm worried whether I'll cope, but I feel so close to Sonia. I think I understand her, but I'm confused and, to be honest, a little scared. Could I possibly talk to you about that? -Yes, first thing tomorrow. -How about now, at the club? Asen, the manager wants you in his office. -Where is Aya? -She's sleeping. And what does that one want? I'll be waiting for you at the club. I've been through 12 managers in three theatres. When they call you to their office, you should keep an eye out. Who knows what bug got into his head again. He doesn't even bother to greet me. Like he's passing through empty space. But why bother?. You're now in top form. You'll play Voinitsky in Uncle Vanya. I used to dream of doing that role but it never happened. I played Treplev in the 70s. What a great production it was. But you wouldn't know these things. You think the world begins with you. Who wouldn't know? Me and Venko, three years we've been nagging him to agree on Uncle Vanya. I'm 45 already. Heh, 45 he is. And I'm retiring in a year, kiddo. Sic transit Gloria mundi, meaning: "Thus passes the world's glory." The past is gone. Loads of time ahead of you. So you want to be on stage till you are 200, huh? No, of course not, but see here, Richard III goes down and I don't play in other productions. And then? What's the deal? I'm out of business. We'll see about that. Taking down Richard III, is he? -Why don't you talk to Venko? -About? About Telegin, the impoverished squire. -No, I can't do that. -It's just right for you, man. -Oh, come on. -It's fucking great, man. Maybe I should talk to him? Well, if you do that, I'll be in your debt. Look, Chekhov is a sure bet. No minor roles there. You telling me? Listen, we'll put together a gang that will rock the world, you hear me? Fingers crossed, man. Daddy, I'm sleepy. Daddy, I have to pee. Oh, take this. -You too? -Excuse me? -You too were at the play? -Yes. Bored me to tears. I never go to the theatre, but, because of… you know. Fate. Collect their bottles, I will. Tore up my binbags. -And long too. -You don't say. How do they memorize these lines? Yapping away for two hours. What is this? The manager's been waiting for 15 minutes. You might be an actor, but it's me who'll take the fall. Let's just take it easy, huh. But you were very good. This is for you. -Daddy, the knights won't show up. -Easy now, they will. -When are we leaving? -Soon, hang on a little longer. -Daddy, I'm sleepy. -Now, now… Leave it to me. I'll keep an eye on her. Let's see now, who's come to see me? -Such a pretty child. -Thank you. -Is she yours? -I hope so. -Congratulations with your performance. -Thank you. Come over to our table. I can't right now. A little later, perhaps? -We'll be waiting. -Okay, in a sec. -Look at me, are you that sleepy? -Yes. Seems the sandman's here, huh? Daddy will pick you up in a tic. Actually, we got onto Uncle Vanya together with Asen, so… Hey, Asen, hi. Come in, come in. Take a seat. Petyo, why didn't you say you're taking down Richard III? -Didn't I? -No. Oh, sorry. Must have slipped my mind. Big cheese. Take a seat. I need to finish something with Venko and then I'm all yours. We tell him tomorrow, I think. And then he can retire. Calm down a bit. And we can breathe a little easier, too. -Talking about Yavor? -Yep. I was just going to suggest him for Uncle Vanya. Telegin. He's just the one for the part. Yes. Not a bad idea. Wait, wait. Think first. Do you need him that much? Now that you are taking down Richard III, he has no other part. Yes, Asen, I know. Look now, let's leave Richard till the end of the season. It'll soon be the 100th performance, right, Venko? And this way Yavor gets to play a little longer. Come on, guys. You'll drive me crazy. What's all this about? What are you thinking? One wants this part, the other doesn't want that part… Should I keep it on stage for six years just because of an old guy who'll retire? Better let him go, take on somebody young, think about the future of the theatre. People are sick and tired of seeing the same old faces for years on end. Let's put others and not ourselves first for a change. Richard bloody Third. Okay, just let him do Uncle Vanya and that's it. You're telling me you actors are not important to me? You want to know something? It was supposed to be a secret. You know what a send-off I've arranged for him? Right here, in the theatre. Everybody present. Actors, staff, colleagues, presents, everything. A day neither he, nor the colleagues will ever forget. So you don't worry about him. It'll all be just fine. Now let's see what we do about you. When was your last TV part? I can't remember. Long ago. Why? Well, that's the problem. Get a part, be more pushy. I won't get in the way. I'll let you do your thing. And it will be good for the theatre, people will come just to see you. Well, I want to do TV stuff but I'm not getting any offers. Exactly. That's the problem. No offers. How can you expect any offers, look at yourself. Pull yourself together. What are you talking about? Come on, we know who's worth what. Is there a problem? Yes, Asen, there is. A problem. Venko and I were talking about it just before you came in. We really want you to play in Uncle Vanya. Right? Actually, it's nobody's fault. Times have changed. There are new faces out there. It's them people want to see. What are you saying, Venko? Plus, this way you can have a rest, see things for what they are. -You know very well… -Sure he does. Don't we all. But for the production and the theatre, it's best if Boyan plays Uncle Vanya. Who? Come on. Boyan Velev. The guy everybody's talking about. He'll bring in an audience, it'll be sold out. You will get a part, too, of course. Hold on, audience numbers are just fine, as far as I can see. Richard packs the crowds and you're taking it down. Same play for six years. On and on until retirement, huh? -Five. -Yes, five. Venko, no smoking here. Asen, look. Nothing's final yet. We are here talking, as you can see. Discussing things. So we find what's best for everyone. Plus, Boyan really wants to get back on stage. You've already talked to him? Well, he really wants it. And we'll do it so he can go about his other business and… Venko, come on. So it's already been decided. I told you he'd be like that, didn't I? But you just stay there and keep silent. Asen, I… I know that… Well, yes, it is your project. Okay. Maybe… Can't we both do the part? Isn't he very busy? We've discussed that option, too. But it's not possible. Things are extremely difficult for the theatre right now. If people are coming in to see the star, they won't be happy with somebody else. They'll feel cheated somehow. And it should be him on the poster, isn't that so? Excuse me. Venko, let's have a cigarette. -I thought there was no smoking here? -Come on, give me one. Hi, dear. -Where are you? -In the theatre. -Is the performance over? -Yep. We're leaving soon. -Is Aya okay? -Yes. She had a nap. Mom and dad are already here. We're waiting for you. Yes, yes. We're leaving. Listen, I can't talk right now. I'll call you back. -Just don't be late. -We won't. Are you okay? Yes. I just have to go now. Kiss you. I love you too. Gets drunk and pretends to be sick. Screws up rehearsals. Who does he think he is? No way I can trust him with that part. He's the reason I'm staging this play. Without him, there would have been no Richard III. Well, he's the reason I'm taking it off, because you can't count on Asen anymore. If you can't do without him, we're simply not doing Uncle Vanya. I can't find the money anyway. Asen… you… you can go if you like. See your kid. -How old is she now? -Six. Lovely. Go now. Venko and I will talk it over, make some decisions and call you. -Juice? -Thank you. -Dad, you? -No, thanks. Would you like some salad now or shall we wait a while longer? We'll wait. -Did you go? -Nope. Give me a drink. Please, sit next to me. I've saved you a seat. Thanks, just a sec. -Shall I put it on your tab? -I'll pay on the 15th. No worries. -When did Aya fall asleep? -Soon after you left. What's going on here? Drinking away the time, huh? When I tell you to cut it short, do it. Four colleagues were waiting for me, plus the sound engineer. Then they left. That TV bitch isn't crazy about me as it is. I was gonna get into the Indian soap. Now she'll cut me off. But you can't know what I'm talking about, you've never been near a dubbing job. You're ruining me. Danche, get me a juice. -One lev, right? -One twenty. What do you mean, one twenty? Wasn't it one? It has never been one. I'm so happy you came. I promised, didn't I. -And? -What? -Did you mention me? -Sure. -And? -You are on. You are the best. God bless you. Just now, I was telling them about The Seagull, that great production. It was the 70s and he came to Bulgaria. A great Russian playwright, Aleksei Arbuzov was his name. It was the Soviet Union then. And he came to our theatre to see The Seagull. After that we go to a pub and he says: "Yavor, I'll take this to Moscow. Show the Russians how Chekhov is done." Excuse me. That very Arbuzov told me a story… -Hello. -Hello. These are friends of mine, from abroad. -A pleasure. Nice to meet you, Dimov. -You too. -Dimov. -A pleasure. -Dimov. Dimov. -Nochev. Oh, yes. This is especially for you. We asked what you usually have. Russian. -Cheers. -Cheers. Cheers. Welcome. I always take them to your theatre. I've personally seen you in almost all your roles. The audience loves you, you are the face of the theatre, so to say. The face… you're flattering me. What's coming up next? Uncle Vanya. But I just turned it down. What a pity. Yeah, but I didn't have a choice. Too many engagements… And I won't be here anyway. Never mind. You are a talented, much wanted actor. Maybe a big movie part? But he wouldn't tell us anything about that. "My child, it's so painful. If only you knew how full of pain I am." Voinitsky. That's Uncle Vanya's surname. The last lines of the play. You actors. One never knows when you're playing on stage and when in real life. Thank you very much. Come and see other performances, even if I'm not in them. That's life, you know. Thank you once again. All the best. Have a nice evening. Where are you going? We got a second prize there. We could've got one more, but… -Hey, Asen. -Hey, how are things? How are you? You really make things work… Don't I? Come on, sit down. A drink? -No, no. Thanks. -He doesn't sit down for one drink. -Well, to Uncle Vanya. -Welcome to the theatre. Asen, you sure you don't want it? What are you talking about? Don't you worry about Asen. He already had his. Will Asen take part? That's what we were discussing. Going with two casts. -But we decided not to. -Why? It's not a bad idea. Not bad, but we don't have much time for rehearsals and we can't do it. Plus, it should be you on the poster. That's something I will approve, because there was this one time… No problem. Of course. And don't forget, please, to mention the theatre when you go for TV interviews. It's really important. -Hey, I completely forgot. -What? Surprise. -Hello, is this a good time? -Of course it is a good time. The TV insisted on a reportage for my stage comeback and… Boyan, why didn't you tell us, give us time to prepare. It won't take long. Where can we shoot? I was thinking on stage. That can be arranged, right? Of course it can, no problem at all. Oh, I forgot to introduce you. Mr. Rumenov, the manager. -Hello, Kaprieva. -Mr. Abrashev, the director. And Asen, a colleague. Great. You can say a few words, too. No need for that. The star is here, the director is here. I am here, and… Look, I can show you the way. Come. Now… this way. Can we light up the stage? Of course, of course. Come. This way. We had performances at ten in the theatre lobby. I know, Yavka, I know. And things now? Nobody plays at ten at night anymore. And after the performance we go to a pub and he says: "Yavorka, I'll tell my friend Viktor Rogov that you gave it a better ending. You improved on his play." Then we went to Leningrad, as it was called then, St. Petersburg now. The production was really superb, a big hit in Sofia. Ten years it was on. So we play, bow at the end and the audience stand up and won't leave. They just stand there and applaud. On and on, three times, four times… Nothing, man. They stay up. We bow and they applaud, get up, shout "Bravo, Bravo, Bravo." They simply won't leave. And I think, like, it's time to go home, to… We're all sweaty. Dripping. The works. Half an hour goes by and we're stuck there… Hah, Asen, where did you disappear to? To the manager's office again? Get me one. I will, but don't you think you've had enough? I'm still saving your seat. Be careful or the manager will have a word with you. How so? So. That's how it is around here. That's how it is with young actresses. The manager gets to know them first. Then he gives the other colleagues the green light to get to know them too. And so we all get to know each other. You're pulling my leg. No. I'll finish my juice and go. This kid show in the morning is just… Two commercials I've passed by this month only. Hey, Asen, when you go to the manager, ask him to cut down on the kid stuff. Yeah, right. I'd love to play in kid shows. Hah. See, the young ones want to play. Let them play then. I haven't tried dubbing either. You'll have to try dubbing too. But it's not for everyone. You're pulling my leg again. Pulling your leg… No, we're serious. Theatre is an actor's true home. TV, film, they're more than welcome. But an actor's soul is in the theatre. -Films. I'd love to do that. -There are no real films anymore. -Mihail, you're really mean. -See? I have a problem. There's something I can't understand about Sonia. Does she actually love you? I mean, Uncle Vanya. Because I don't see what else is keeping her there. See here, sweetie. That sort of question is for the director. But he won't be able to answer you either. See? Wow, am I glad they didn't give me a part in Uncle Vanya. Three productions a season are more than enough for me, no? What? Now if the kid show is taken down… I think Sonia is in love with you, not quite the way relatives are. She loves you and there is no force that can keep her away. What do you think? Do you love her? He probably loves her, she's his niece. What can he do, but love her? What do I care anyway? I'm not playing in Uncle Vanya. What do you mean, you're not playing? Are you turning it down? But that's a dream role for any actor. Don't leave me like that. You can't leave me like that. -What's going on? Where are you? -I was just with the manager. Why? You were supposed to bring Aya home. And my folks left. I told you, she's sleeping. I don't want to wake her. -Are you drunk? -Oh, come on. Please, come in. This is our club. Ah, here are our colleagues. This way, please. Hey, guys, where have you been? Yes, honey. Look, honey, I can hear that you are having fun. I'm just asking you to bring our baby home. Right now. -Okay, okay. -Don't you tell me okay, okay. I want Aya home. As soon as possible. You hear me? -We'll talk at home. -Again? Danche, the bottles, please. -Thank you. -Just a sec. We're all family here. This ambiance of friendship and creativity will certainly get to the audience. The audience can feel things like that, trust me. You said it so well. Pity we didn't get it on camera. Get it then. And that's not all. You have no idea what it takes to make a professional theatre a success. We have time, though, right? This is not the last time we meet. Of course not. I'd like to invite you and your cameraman to the opening night of Uncle Vanya. Right? Certainly. -Does everyone have a drink? -Yes. Danche, turn down that din. Dear colleagues, I'd like to make a toast. A toast to our guests. Welcome. I'd like to wish our director Venko Abrashev lots of creativity and inspiration in the challenge to stage Chekhov in these difficult times for the theatre and art in general. Good luck. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. One more thing. Last one, then I'm done. -Boyan, get up, please. -Now, what… Please. Here's a true man of art who needs no introduction. On my request and insistence, he agreed to play Uncle Vanya. And now is the time, on behalf of you all… to declare how glad and proud we all are that Boyan is now one of us. Cheers and good luck. It's an honour. Oh, may I be excused. The whole bill's on me. So you're really not playing? Why don't you take my part in the kid show? I have this other thing going. Bonev, stop it. That's not for you to decide. I was just going to congratulate you on today's performance. You were there? No, I had special guests in the audience who were very impressed with Bonev. And Asen, of course. We can say whatever we like, but there's no feeling like being on stage. An actor's home is the theatre. Now we should definitely get that. Can you repeat it for the camera? Let's not bore the viewers with my humble self. Pretty please. Boyan, please, these things should be said. After all, isn't that what it's all about? The audience should hear this. Right? Come on, Abrashev, back me up. Yeah, right, sure… They should be known, yeah… If you insist… Here? Yes, why not? Phillip. -Are you an actress? -Yes. Good for you. Are we set to go? The lighting is no good. Sorry, could you change places, please? -Sorry, man, but as you can see… -Of course. Thank you very much. -We're on. -Silence, please. Mr. Velev, what does the theatre mean to you? Could we do that again? Colleagues, please, let's have a little respect here. Action. Mr. Velev, what does the theatre mean to you? Difficult question. If I have to answer in a single sentence, the theatre is my home. Thank you very much. Cut. Well done. Well done. Hey, things will work out, won't they? Right, Abrashev, it will all work out. What? Why are you so deep in thought? You can start thinking from Wednesday on, at rehearsals, right? Let's be more… Danche, what, no music? See, when I was in a TV series three years ago… -When? -Recently, three years ago. And… That's exactly what I was talking about. Can I have a dance with you? And I decided to focus my creative energy on dubbing since my voice is so recognizable. Well done, Rumenov. Sorry, man, take your seat. -Oh, so you just graduated. -Yes, this year. Any roles already? Well, I'll be playing Sonia in Uncle Vanya. -Wow. So we'll be performing together. -Yes. And I believed you. Thank you anyway. I'm done with the theatre. It's done and over with. For example, there was this play once my colleague on stage is sweating it, jumping and strutting around. And me, I just get on stage, I reach for an olive and… Applause. Okay, tell me now, how can this possibly be a manager? It's possible. These days anything's possible. Cheers. I love to dance. I used to do ballet as a kid. That's amazing. -Your phone's ringing. -Let it ring. Aren't you going to answer? It could be something important. Nonsense. They've been trying to get me all day for a film production. -Really? And you? -They will have to wait. Nothing can take me away from your fascinating smile. -You're flattering me. -Not in the least. I didn't know you were such a great dancer. You haven't seen anything yet. Thank you. There's so much I can learn from you. Hey, Boyan? What's your thing with women? Tell me. You should teach me a few tricks so I can get the fine line right. You are my role model, Rumenov. You'd say that, wouldn't you. Danche, get everyone a drink, on me. We won't let the star buy all the drinks. We know how to live, too. Daddy! Hey, what's this? Some kids just don't have luck with their parents. We, actors, are like that. I've never taken my kids to a pub. You haven't taken them to the theatre either. Don't worry, Daddy is here. Go to sleep, my dear. Yavor, you know what you mean to me. I tried to do something today, but… The theatre is not the same anymore. Nothing's up to the director. I'm sorry. Don't you worry about me. But your friend… That'll be the end of him. I know. No recognition. You're left out of the shot. I'm the one making the shot, dude. And you know what? We have more managers and directors than you do. I have to make a short documentary in a couple of minutes. Get it? You need reflexes for that, dude. There are no multiple takes here… But you mention reflexes, and they are extremely important in my dubbing, too. Plus intuition, an actor's intuition. These are things that matter, get it? Dubbing requires talent and work. Hard work. My colleagues, may they live long in good health… I don't mean to say anything bad… But let them try on my shoes. Let them try this dubbing thing, show us what they can do. I'm not undermining… Danche, got anything for a headache? Let me check. I have, after all, become a recognizable voice over the years. Come on, I know that. What's wrong, Venko? Why aren't we talking anymore? What the hell do you want from me, Asen? Looking for someone to blame, huh? Okay, it's all my fault. Are you relieved now? What could I do? Look at me, Venko. Look at me. Come on, look at me. Do you remember how we dreamed of doing Chekhov? I remember, Asen, I remember. But I have no say at all. The manager's got my back against the wall. If I don't take Boyan, I won't be doing the production. So now you intend to keep quiet and do nothing. You know what you are? What am I? A traitor? A coward? Feeling better now? No, not feeling better. You think you know everything. You are always right. -You know what's the worst a man can do? -No. It's to start taking himself seriously. Look at yourself. I fight for you, and you… you stay here all day long and drink. I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but… You are not the same person anymore. Not even the same actor. So you think I'm no good anymore, Venko? Since when? It's not only my opinion, Asen. Nobody wants to work with you. They just don't say it to your face. Because I'm an alcoholic? Tell me. Is that so? Tell me, am I an alcoholic? Say it. Okay, I'm saying it. You should stop drinking or… Wait, am I a good actor? I'm sorry I started this conversation. Tell me. Do I have talent? -You used to. -I used to? And where is that talent now? Maybe I threw it away with an emptied bottle? You don't understand. Yeah. And where is your talent? I'm ending this conversation. Who's pulling your productions, Venko? I feel sorry for you, Asen. -Danche, get me a drink. -Asen, let's… Shut the fuck up and give me a drink. But that's terrible. It was terrible. That's why I got so worked up. I went to the director and I told him: "Get lost." I went to the cameraman and said: "Now you put on an 85 lens and you don't stop filming, no matter what." I called "Action" and I started walking towards her. -Petyo, can I have a moment? -No, now is not a good time. And instead of kissing her, I slapped her once in the face. She stared at me, completely lost. After ten seconds I slapped her again, then right after that I kissed her. She started crying like an animal… And the scene worked. Really? Of course. Then I hugged her, calmed her down, and then I called "Cut." I can't believe that's how you shot that scene. I cried when I saw it. More or less, I was the one directing until we finished the movie. Is now a good time? No, Asen, now is not a good time either. Go somewhere else, we'll talk later. Or tomorrow, when you sober up. Right? I have an idea. Hey, Iskra, do you know that Viara has just joined the troupe and she is making her debut in Uncle Vanya as Sonia? Well, I'll make a rep on Viara's debut on stage with the star Boyan Velev for the premiere of the production. Great idea. What is it, Asen? I'd like a word, if it's okay. Enough already. Can't you see we are discussing the future of a young actress? Can't you put your colleagues first for once? Think of others for a change? All day long I've been dealing with you. Hey, Asen, how long has it been, man? -How are you? -I'm okay. -Well, you don't look okay to me. -Why? -Are you in some kind of trouble? -Who, me? No. Everything's fine. -Everything's A-OK? -A-OK. -Good for you. -What's up with you? Nothing. I'm good. I'm very happy I'm coming back to the theatre. -It was about time you did that. -Right? I'm fed up with this TV business, man. It's the same thing every single day. A real drag, huh? And it's not just any play. Uncle Vanya. Chekhov, man. -But I feel a bit tense. -How come? I haven't performed on stage in a while, you know how it is. That's why I'm counting on Venko a lot. Venko rocks. Venko will help you a lot. Listen, you two are gonna rule. Go get them, man. Now, we'll do an interview with her before the premiere, so people can remember her. Are you sure? Maybe I won't manage. Don't worry. You'll be fine. I'll help you. It's very important for an actor to communicate with the media. Listen, my dear girl, an actor's future depends on the media and the theatre managers. The media decide if an actor will be popular and how quickly he can be forgotten. I didn't know that. No problem. You are young. You will learn. I was gonna do it for free, but this Rumenov, he… Asen, how can a great actor like you bother about an ass like that? Me? He's the one doing the bothering. I don't have a problem with him. So take no notice. He's taken himself too seriously. If I was you, I'd take my kid and go home. Why go through all this? You know what will happen. They'll get drunk as skunks and the crap will start. Take your kid and go home. I'm going soon, too. I have a shoot at nine tomorrow. You are right. Absolutely right. I'll do that. Danche, what happened? Sorry. I hit the wrong button. Asen? Where's Aya? Wait, wait. I'll help you. Wait, wait. I'll help you. I can manage on my own. -You think I'm an alcoholic too? -Get in, we'll talk at home. Tell me. Is that what you think? Are you coming with us? They took Uncle Vanya away from me. I'm sorry, I really am. Coming? I have to stay. I love you. I love you. I'll wait for you. Alcohol does not excuse people. Yeah, that didn't go too well. Poor Asen. Yeah, right, poor Asen. Why are you so sorry for him? He should be grateful I'm still keeping him on. Anybody else in my place would have long ago… Sorry. -What are you doing, you moron? -I said I'm sorry. Sorry. Asshole. -What did you say? -Drunken prick. Who do you think you are? -Do you know who you are? -Shut up. You drunk piece of shit. Enough. -If you don't know, I'll tell you. -Oh, really? Why don't you tell me? Asen, not now. Come on… You are an envious son of a bitch. That's what you are. Tell me, do you remember how they appointed you from the ministry? No, how did they? Parachute-like. You fucking henchman. Contest, my ass. And I almost forgot. It's me Viara likes. -You? -Yes, me. Yes, me. Me. Keep your hands off her, you dirty faggot. That's right. You heard me. Look at me. Look. Eat your heart out, go on… Because that's all you can do. Now you've done it. Go do your rubbish shows. Well, dear colleagues, can you believe it? After everything I've done for the theatre, what do I get in return? What? What is it you've done for this theatre? Come on, Asen, enough. Nothing. A whole lot of nothing. And you know why? Because you are a gutless midget. Because you're a dwarf of a soul. Asen. Enough already. I don't give a fuck. I just don't. Actually, who are you to speak to me like that? I'm the face of the theatre. You are the face of the theatre? Look at yourself, you fucking alcoholic. The face of the theatre. What about the rest of us? We are just here to put up posters of you, huh? That's right, that's why you're here. You know why? Because I'm the face of the theatre, while you are its ass. Come on. Come… Come and shit all over me. That's enough. The end. I'm closing. Well, we should be on our way. I'm really sorry you witnessed this ugly scene. It was really a pleasure. One can't get bored around you people. Yes. That's true. Misho? Mihail. Show some manners, let's see the guests off. Oh, right, right. And that kid thing I've got tomorrow morning, it really… Bye. Venko, say something. Why are you silent? Is that what should have happened? Is that what you needed to see to realize he's no good for Uncle Vanya? He can't even get up on stage. But you kept going. "Asen is Uncle Vanya, he's the one." Asen was to play Uncle Vanya? That's an old reading. Yes, yes. Before you showed up. Venko? Was Asen the lead? Well, yes. We've been thinking this up for three years, he and I… Asen. Why didn't you tell me? Tell you. Can't you see the state he is in? I can see very well. What, Boyan? Is there a problem? Is the salary too low for you? We can negotiate, if you like. It's not about the money. Is that so? You were the one who wanted a theatre comeback, right? Because there are other stars, you know? Hey, Rumenov, there are other directors too, you know? Please don't fight. Everything was so great until a few moments ago. I'm ashamed of everything going on here. I've had it. I'm gone. Rumenov, there are also other theatres. Seems you got the wrong idea. Venko. Boyan. Boyan. Guys. My friends. What's the big deal? We had a few, so what. We have a few every night. Right? Asen, tell them. If you like, we can continue at my place? Okay? Don't be like that. if it's something I said, I'm sorry. We are to make theatre happen, Chekhov. Big theatre. Theatre is your life, Boyan, no? Venko, Venko. Don't let me down. Wait, please. Don't go. Asen, dear, you're done with theatre. -Sorry. -It's okay. Is he alright? No, he's not. I love that boy. Success is difficult to cope with. Success is like luck. If you don't hold it tight it flies away and leaves you alone to talk to the devils inside you. You think somebody fucked you over, but that's not exactly true. Nobody else is to blame and nobody can help you because it's your devils you're up against. "My child, it's so painful. If only you knew how full of pain I am." I'm really sorry. Good morning from me, Iskra Kaprieva. As usual, our channel was the first to spot the big event of the upcoming theatre season. Namely, the comeback of a cinema and TV favourite the great Boyan Velev. Hello, what made you return to theatre? Good morning from me, too. Actually, I wouldn't put it that way exactly. I've never left the theatre. It was a matter of time before I came back. And the offer Mr. Rumenov made, for which I'm thankful is not something one can pass up. Uncle Vanya by Chekhov. The truth is, the theatre needs me, and I need the theatre. Mr Rumenov, how did you manage to get Boyan Velev on your cast? Daddy!
