Ah Yiu Donate some money from me OK Have a smoke I've quit Cigarettes are bad for you So, try a cigar Thank you Of Hung Hings' 12 branch leaders, Ho Nam, do you know why you are the only one I invited here? Because you are family My brother After the unification with China, Hong Kong is said to be unchanged for 50 years But money attracts attention Do you think we are not being watched by the Beijing? Look, that's Western District Once it was a war zone for heroes My dad, Jiang Chun, when he was young, he worked as coolie and fought the world with his fists At that time, he used his physical force Not wisdom It's different now We should use our brains now! Being a rascal, you better use your brain! When liaising with the officials, you should use your brain What you have just said... I would bear in mind Ho Nam, think big and forget the street fights In the past, wearing T shirts and jeans, was OK, now, you should wear suit, be neat and tidy This is what we call self improvement Befriend the rich and connected With the triad's business, always be low-key With making money, be high-keyed! I understand that Once I looked at the mirror and thought, "Who am I?" "What am I doing?" I want to U turn... But there is no going back. Have you ever thought of these? No Because I've always known what I am... where I am... and what am I going to do Ho Nam, you are smart I am sure you can make it Sure you can make it If Hong Kong is prosperous, Hung Hing will be prosperous Hung Hing goes well, Hong Kong will go better!

I'll do it Don't worry When you come out from jail, you'll be promoted I was worried and didn't step up, are you still angry with me? I was childish I thought I'd be promoted quickly after spending years in jail, The judge sent me away for 9 years I spent eight years there If I took your place, perhaps, you would have achieved more It's not that easy I didn't mean to blame you It's true I have been angry with myself I wasted eight years The most precious time in one's life Well, I've got two Bs and three Cs in the HKCEE But what I lost... would never come back How are you doing? Come back with us Big Head, you know Nam very well To be frank, I don't want to be triad again Following Nam is better than selling newspaper, is that right? I haven't met you before Are you new? I've made up my mind, I just want to go straight, and I don't want anything to do with the triads again But you need triad cover to sell newspaper in street Tell me, what field is not related to the triads? The triads are not everything Well, worse comes to worst, I won't sell newspaper, alright? What else can you do? Work in restaurant, in fast-food shop, be a taxi or mini-bus driver? It's true, they are all related to triad's business This is Hong Kong There are many Kind of triad activities It depends on your choice You think triads are that powerful? Can triad collect protection fee from the HK Bank? I think I can make a living without triads Not interesting, right? Thank you for your treat What a scum!

Brother Tin-yeung, you should back me up Before the death of your dad and elder brother I was managing the Western District Among 12 branch leaders in Hung Hing, I am the most senior Sure Being rascals, we should be loyal and respect the old Sure But Ben, that scum! He betrayed me! You know, I used to earn much from the piers but after the western cross harbor tunnel, everything is finished That's why I talked to Lam and got a new idea, to bid a new mini-bus route from Central to Jordan You know, when the new airport is open, the terminal in Jordan will be prosperous So? Ben and Lam want to expel me from the project What do you want me to do? We are so happy to receive the donation... Brother Key, you are the senior in our group, sure I will help you! And we would like the Datuk, Mr. Chan Ka-nam... Key is a liar! He just talks, but he didn't give us a penny At first, we said we would join together to run the route, but it's not his plan Lam and I would like to bid a new route, from Kwai Chung to Jordan and then to Western District, Mr. Jiang, you know very well that, it's not easy to apply for a license We've tried so hard to get it I invested few millions into this project, that's all I have! Now, I don't even have a penny! He wants a share, but he doesn't want to pay Boss, be frank, it's not fair? A minibus costs half a million, you know? It's not easy to engage in decent trade, you know? Don't worry, Ben, have my support!

I know all the branch leaders of Hung Hing were there I was just on tour around Your boys gave me a lift from the airport You know the fire at the newspaper stall wasn't me If it were, you would have been cuffed I'll cuff you one day, When I get enough evidence Try this tea, it's tasty It costs few thousand a box It's bitter You'll get used to it We rascals are prepared to be questioned by cops, it's understood Tung Sing did it, you've got the wrong person One hand won't make noise itself I hope you will not pick on me and Hung Hing only I will arrest anyone who commits crimes That's great I told you, I'll talk to you if anything happens in Causeway Bay Well, may I leave how? It's not easy to be a branch leader I haven't come here for a long time Remember? Boss Bee taught us boxing But you didn't work hard, I did want to work hard Big Head In 1995, I was trapped by Kwan Boss Bee gave me a punishment It ruined my name I tried to open a bar in Sai Kung To live into seclusion with my woman I heard that in prison What I want to say is, you chose your path You'll have to return It's not like driving, there's no U-turns I am different I've thought carefully If you were the one to be the scapegoat, I wouldn't have had become a branch leader You didn't offend them But they came to bully you! You should fight back! I won't! Ho Yung has told everyone that, they will juice you up! If you didn't get involved, it wouldn't have happened Are you sick? You punched the sandbag fiercely, but you dared not punch Ho Yung and his dogs? Practicing boxing isn't fighting Are you a saint? Foreskin! Big Head, remember the day we had dim-sum early in the morning? You said the bankers won't pay the triads, right? How about credit? If you don't pay the bank, who collects for the bank? We do it Do you think the staffs of the bank will collect it? Let me tell you an incident happened 2 months ago in Taiwan, Thousands were protesting Protests against the Mayor Chen Shui-bien Cause he didn't let them operate suauna clubs, internet cafes and nightclubs These business aren't illegal, but the government said no Tell me, how can they have peace? There should be two sets of laws in any societies One is governed by the government And the other is governed by the triads The underworld laws You haven't boxed for years? What do you want? Try to defeat me Mr. Chan Ho Nam Why didn't you call? I'd have someone pick you up I am waiting What's wrong ? Are you hurt? I got hurt a bit practicing boxing, it's no big deal Boxing?
