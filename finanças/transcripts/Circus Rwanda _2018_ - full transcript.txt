...He’s got a really high fever! How come there isn't any doctor who... Alright, stop. You have to plunge into that situation... Walking across the stage when I'm in the middle of a rehearsal?! You must be kidding! This is too much! I've had enough! The same thing every day! It's as if someone walked in front of your camera while you're shooting! I can't concentrate and neither can anyone else! Where are the Rwandans going to stay? In the room above the hall. No way, that’s the dressing room for actors from “The Family”. In that case... I thought we’d booked some rooms in a hotel. Yes, but those were supposed to be for “The Family” ensemble, so the Rwandans could stay here. You mean you haven’t discussed it? I had no idea they were supposed to stay here. No one has told me. Well, they can't stay here! Hello, do you speak English? ...Holešovice and The Prague Market... Oh, OK. Thank you so much, madam. - God bless you. - You are welcome. Goodbye! - Hello. -Rostja. - Nice to see you. - Nice to see you. - Rosťa. - Eliseé. - Hello. Nice to see you. Welcome. - Thank you so much. What do you think about our space and the show? It was really nice... An amazing show. We don’t usually rehearse in here. We use it to perform. It seats 360 people. A room for a technician is here. This is my wife’s sanctuary, she's a costume designer. There must be a thousand different costumes in here. Training space... Wow, it’s amazing. How long are you going to stay in Prague, 5 days? - Yeah. - Yes? OK. Wow, nice. This is your space. You can stay here. What’s your experience with a trampoline? - “Experience with a trampoline”? - Yes. If... ...you can jump on a big trampoline. - Yes, I can jump. - Yes? And you? - I can try. - He’s never tried it. - Never? - Never. Is this the way they pray? I don't know. It is so weird here; some people are praying while others are taking pictures. They're the ones who know God. They probably know God better than we do... What do they need to pray for? They know what they’re doing. But it was them who brought the religion to us, right? If only I could have this small piece here... ...just this little one. Even the smallest piece... If you could have one of these wings... You could live off that money for a long time. At least for 20 years. I don’t get it. This place is full of huge things made of gold... There are books written in gold in here... What matters to me are your skills. What you can do has nothing to do with connection or meaning, it’s all about your skills. I need to know what you’re capable of because... ...today there will be a rehearsal with all of us and... It’ll help us later if we see it now. OK? Thank you very much. See you at 1 p.m. Let’s have a 30-minute break now and... ...then we’ll start. But stay warm, because we’re going to do physical things. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you! Do you use any aerial stuff? Like aerial silk or trapeze or rope? Do you have any rigging points? Nothing... We have nothing. Just the ground and grass. - Ground and grass... - Yeah. My idea is to choose the best acrobats over there and bring them to the Czech Republic. I’d definitely like to go to Rwanda in eh... ...a yellow overall that would protect me against all mosquitos and... No, no, no... You just need to get vaccinated. When you get the vaccination, there is no problem. No problem? - Are you sure? - Yes. - WOW! Welcome to Rwanda! - Nice to see you! - How are you? - I’m fine! I’m so happy to have you here in Rwanda. Now, you’re going to meet Ange, the general secretary. - Are we all staying here? - All of us. -I see... Man, I gotta take my antibiotics... He's gonna laugh, when he sees my personal pharmacy, dude. Check this. Medication for asthma... But the cherry on top... Is that what you’ve packed instead of antimalarial pills? No, that's not it - yet! Look, it’s all from a hospital. - Ah, your little Ventolin! - My inhaler. It's fundamental. A new one. I'm gonna add this here, so it doesn’t look like we’re promoting only certain companies. You're most welcome. Hello, Rubavu, I'm Rosťa! Thank you, Oscar, welcome! You're welcome, Oskar. - Rosťa. My name is Rosťa. - Rostja? - Thank you very much for having me. - We can’t pronounce his name... We'll try later, we don’t have “ť” in our language. How did you meet this guy? One Swedish artist who works in the Czech Republic... ...he was here... ... about three years ago... ...he met Eliseé and his group. And... The important thing for me is not just to come to Rwanda and be here with Eliseé and the artists, but to work together and find some connection, some similarity. We have one thing in common. We all started with contemporary circus from zero. Our show is almost over... We’ll get back to you after answering a call from our listener. Radio Rubavu, hello! - This is Aline from Makoro. - Yes, Aline? I didn’t get what this discussion is about. We’re talking about a project that will be carried out together by acrobats from Rubavu district and artists from the Czech Republic. Some of them are here with us right now. Their aim is to bring Rwandan and Czech culture closer together. They’ve been working on this project for a few days now. Ok. Do you have a question for them? No, I just wanted to know the topic. Ok, thank you. She just wanted to know what the show was about. That midget over there is cool, man! I’d love to have her in the circus! Do you have any news about the trampoline? Holly shit! Chill out. A real champ can do with tree branches. Dude, this is a church too! I can’t step on it! Man, they can jump so high! Look at their heels! They’re so much bigger! Kind of flatter. - It cost thirty thousand. - Thirty thousand? - Yeah. - That’s a lot. - Yeah, that’s a lot... But this is an old one! This is trash! It’s not trash because people make shoes from it. - Shoes? - Yes, they make shoes and sell them. And how... How do they make them? They cut out a shoe sole shape and then they put... like sandals. OK. - Is it possible to buy the sandals from... - Of course. - Yes? - Yeah, yeah. If I had twenty thousand in cash I could... You know what? In the Czech Republic we supported our theatre by... It’s called Kickstarter. It’s like fundraising. You ask people around, your friends... ...your supporters if they could help you. If everybody here gave you 2000 francs, you’d soon collect 30,000. I can ask them. So, you or me? You! Because I don’t need that tire, you do. - Yeah, I’ll try. - Let’s do it! - I’m the first one. - Thank you! Would anyone help us buy a tire for the kids? Not even 100 RWF? How about you over there...? Would you donate 100 RWF? We are collecting donations. - ...if you can... - Thank you, thank you... They’re collecting money for a tire. 2000 RWF. Thank you for that... Thank you for that... Four thousand. Thank you, guys! I bet it’s not so easy to balance that on a head. Look, a cow! A runaway cow, man! Runaway cows on the road! Holly crap! Those guys on the motorbike must have been thrilled! Half a ton of beef heading towards you... Eliseé, you said “something like this”, not the big one... Yeah, yeah, I meant “this”. It was like this. Is there another one, but skinnier? “This size” means that it's like this and... Now, you want a big speaker but I don’t have enough money for that. I can get you a different one. - Screw that... - To the loudspeaker! So I gave him 125,000 in that goddamn currency of theirs today. Thank you! Our task now is to concentrate on our meeting with the Cirk La Putyka. They have to see that you have the skill, that you are really talented, and that you’re so good that others can learn from you. I’m sure we’ll succeed, because those who respect God are automatically given the best things. The wisdom He gives us will guarantee us a happy life on this Earth. I'm not religious, but I’d never have expected to see these people to go to a Christian church. Look, she’s dressed as Snow White! Just like the real Snow White. This is the rotten legacy of our European culture, dude. We came here, took their religion and their culture away... They must have had their own rituals and stuff, right? And we forced this upon them... I’d like to see them sing and perform their dances, instead of listening to: “God is everything there is.” Have you thought through what you’re going to present here? You’re going to perform in front of a lot of professionals. Many of them have a lot to give you. You have your hands, legs and skills, so use them wisely. Instead of repeating a mistake, focus only on jumps. It's raining. Oh man, this is unbelievable! Shit! Screw it, it's like being in the Holešovice Market. I'm gonna have Pho-Bo. ...and of course I can get married when... You have a girlfriend? Not yet. I’m looking for one. I’m searching. Maybe you’ll find one in the Czech Republic. - Yes. - Yes. And your mother lives... My mother died during the genocide. - During the genocide? - Yeah. After giving birth to Niyo... ... and also another little baby called Nyishinge. ... and then... ... she and that little baby died. - No. - Yes. Wow! That’s superb! It’s like a battle! - What is your favorite music? - I love pop and R&amp;B. Pop and R&amp;B... And you? - Pop and R&amp;B, generally... - OK. I heard you singing like Prince. Yesterday I heard Justin Bieber. Yeah, we did it. We did Justin Bieber. - And that is your life story. - Yes. My life story. My father and mum died... ...and a sister... - ...Erike’s sister died. - And how...? What happened? Or... When you’re rich you have things... ...but those people don’t have anything. They’d kill me because I have something... ...and they don’t have anything. - So they killed them? - Yes, they killed them. And they were dead. This is me and Erike when we were together without our families, and we became friends. And we were gonna sleep on a street here... ...and the police came and they put us in a prison. Here I am begging, and the man beats me because I am begging. Where do you live now? I don’t have a home. When I see friends I ask if I can sleep at their place and sometimes they let me. So you sleep on a street or... Yeah, it’s like that sometimes. - A very sad story. - Let’s sing. Let’s sing! What’s up, man? What’s up, man? Can you ask this little guy what this is? Is it a Superman? Or Spiderman? - He was flying. - He was flying? - It’s him flying. - Him flying. - It’s a picture of a flyer. - Yeah. Tonda, guess what it is. It’s him, flying. That one's awesome. Him flying. Cool! And Justin has some great drawings too. That's him. He’s drawing another picture now. It’ll have something to do with his family, I bet. That you’d like to... - I’m doing my act... - Act? ...I’m bringing happiness to those children... Maybe we’ll have a chance to... ...give you some job so you can earn money. And when you come back to Rwanda... ...you’ll be able to take care of your brothers. This is my brother. There’s six of us. Brothers and sisters. Sisters. Two sisters and my brother. This one is also a contortionist. - And this one too. - Yes, this one. They’re contortionists. They’re like snakes. Many people are born with this gift. He can also do something like “this”... - How are you, Justin? - Fine. I keep thinking about my mother. I’m going to Congo to look for her. My mother didn’t come back. Nobody knows anything about her? Do you have her photo? - Look, my mother. - What’s her name? - Yvette. - Yvette. Norbeh, Robert... ...Yvette, Fabrice. ...with a troop of less than 10 members, this group of flexible artists is building an industry of circus entertainment in the country. A big part of this involves Future Vision giving the chance to anyone interested to learn their trade for free. How long has it been? Three months? Five months I think. - Five months. - I think... So she just didn't come back one day. Yes. Come! Come here! Move it! Fuck! Thank you! - OK, stop. - OK, stop. - Stop! Stop! - Stop! Stop! OK! Second group! Close your eyes! OK, get up. It’s as if somebody cut the power off. Pretend I came and unplugged your electricity cable. Just fall. As if you were shot down. Yes, again. Close your eyes. OK, super, that was nice. And you’re totally relaxed. You’re like a dead body. Dead. Dead. And you’re observing... ...if he’s alive or not and... ...use his dislocation capability. Rostislav Novák! How was it in Rwanda? I didn't want to go. I was scared, fearing I'd die there. I feared I’d die of malaria, then I thought I’d die in a plane crash, that I’d get shot, because we stayed right by the Congolese border. I went there... I think it was a perfect timing. I came back and... Now I’m all smiles most of the time, I don’t rush anymore... I can reflect on our work with ease and I really appreciate the opportunities our theater company’s got here. - Hello! -How are you? -How are you? Welcome! THE BOOK OF DICK - Justin, you want it spicy, right? - Spicy! -Yes. - Do you want a roll or bread? - Bread. - Bread. What is this? It’s a Czech banana. Matyáš, could you stop and join us? We have guests if you haven’t noticed. Shut it off! Don’t you think it’s rude to hide here like that? We have 10 guys here who might enjoy your company and you just won’t come out. Why don’t you show them some computer game or something! Take the quadcopter and go outside with them! - I’m not ready! - ...or go skating... Well, get ready! This is simply rude. I came to tell you the dinner is ready, so hurry up! Please! Maty... Please, come to the table. I’ve served you some potatoes. - Potatoes? - Yes. Come on... With the avocado dip! There won't be much left soon. Boys! Emanuel, Eric, Abuba! Here is... ...something sweet! Try it and tell others if it’s good or not. Try it. My mother baked it for you. - This? - Yeah. - Really? Is it good? The experience from the trip to Rwanda... ...was a real surprise to me. Like I’d like to go back there. I’d like to show Rwanda to my kids. That’s a bright idea. That’s superb! It would be a good experience for them also. Look, it’s still light outside. Light outside! You know, people in Rwanda would be sleeping by now! Few people are awake at night. But you guys use time to its fullest. We, Africans, when it’s dark... We go home and go to bed. And when the sun comes up, we go to work. Yeah, that’s how we live. It’s very different. We have to make sure we go to bed early. And we’ll have to get up early. - So those guys... - And we go to work... What time do you wake up here in Prague? Those guys never go to sleep. Sometimes I find Justin... ...at two in the morning, sitting, training hard... ...having... chatting on WhatsApp... - When he... - ...on a Facebook... - With whom? With his girlfriend! You have a girlfriend, Justin? Justin! Have you proposed to her yet? Justin lives in the land of a thousand hills, thousand smiles and thousand girlfriends. I’m the boss. Now prove it! - This is it. - This is who? He farted during the prayer that’s why I was laughing! What was I supposed to do? Even mum was laughing! I couldn't do anything but laugh! Well, I didn't know that... ...and tell mum that we loved the cake. Thank you! - Good night! - Good night! And thank you... Good afternoon and welcome to the press conference of the 14th edition of Letní Letná Festival. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. First of all, I'd like to thank the festival for giving us the opportunity to premiere our show there. Otherwise we wouldn’t be able to carry out this project. We’ve brought a guy who specializes in a rather rare discipline. He is a contortionist. He impersonates his mother who died last December. We're in the most intense period now, in which we come up with all the scenes and themes. Time is of the essence, it’s coming up soon... By no means I’d call it an improvisation... It might seem like the aim is to teach them something, but I think it will be them teaching us. How’d you feel about this show? As I always say: "Thank God for everything". And how I feel about this show... ...I’m very happy that I’m going to participate in Letní Letná festival with my company Future Vision Acrobat from Rwanda... ...this is gonna be the first time for us and we feel so much “Wow”. I know how our show is going to start, I know how it’s going to end, but I don’t know what exactly will be in the middle. The stage is divided into two parts. It’s like a cultural clash. Two different cultures crash into each other. Or two people run into each other. We have to figure something out, because now we still don’t know what the final piece will be. I have some ideas, some images in my head. One, two, three and... They do something like a pyramid and it’s awesome. There’s one person at the bottom, another one on his shoulders, and he holds two others. Or this pyramid is made of three acrobats. A helicopter, a car, an airplane, a house... Cool. When Eliseé says: “Nuda” (boring)... ...and Naim is doing the first jump, you have to start immediately. Don’t wait for anything, you’re losing the... Try it. Try. And try it together. Yes, exactly! Great. Thank you, Eliseé. Great. The first sequence, when he’s doing the relaxing salto mortale it's just voices. One chord... No guitar, just you two. Boring! Percussions. Boring! Boring! Boring! And the last sequence... Chord... Screw this! No, no, no! Sing! Holly sh... For fuck’s sake! Everybody! Screw this! Shit! - Abuba. Where are you? - Let’s have a quick word. We have to focus on doing things on time. You saw that a little delay could cost you your job. So even more important than a flawless performance is perfect timing. Having a job goes hand in hand with being on time here. I remember that before we came, they were afraid we’d run away and disappear. But I think you saw that life here is not as easy as we thought. We should keep this to ourselves, others could doubt us. If someone asked me to stay here... I wouldn’t accept it even if it were my own family. Unless he knew exactly what job I’d have here so that I didn't get stuck at home cooking his meals. We’ve really learned a lot here. Maybe you can only think of a few things, but it was a lot. Who’d have imagined that a white guy can get so angry? But you saw it. He smashed his expensive phone into smithereens. He’s capable of smashing your head like that too, so we have to avoid making him angry because now we know what it’s like when the whites lose their temper. - My feeling is happiness. - Happiness? Abuba was there, and he didn’t contribute much. For example, when I’m working with Chuty... Chuty is... He offers ideas and he’s trying. Or Justin for example. They have suggestions, “OK, I could do this, I could do that.” But Abuba is just lying there on the matt, waiting for somebody to say, “Abuba, jump.” Then he’ll jump. It’s starting to be difficult. Now that we have to... Did you see that in the... We have to choose which towers, which pyramids to build. Yeah, we’re gonna show you the games and tricks so you can... Yes, because I think we still... I know that you can do more than what I see now. I know that you can do more. If it’s taking place in this tent, we’ll show them! I was afraid it would be on some classy stage. Here, it’s just like by the lake... I don't think it’s necessary to buy any special lawn, we can perform on this one. They can't wear flip-flops! They need their training gear! Great. They haven’t brought a thing. - They almost brought everything. - What? I said we were moving to the circus tent, and they came down with packed suitcases. So I had to explain what I meant. Guys, when we rehearse here, you have to bring your training clothes. Your training shoes and clothes, and also your civil clothes. Because you can take a shower here and change. We can’t rehearse like this. OK, come in. Welcome. Emanuel, do you remember? Emanuel! Emanuel, do you remember? Emanuel! Your reaction! Emanuel! It has to be... Stop, stop, stop! Emanuel! Emanuel! You have to scream! What does circus mean to you? It means life, it means happiness, it means dreams are coming true, it means a lot. - And for you, Anaclet? - For me, circus means life, because we live with it, that’s what we do. You see the light in your life. That’s what it means. How do you enjoy being with him, under his directorial style? How do you like it? Or the aesthetics he’s putting into the show? - Honestly. - Honestly? To be honest he’s a great guy. - Super. - To be honest, he is a creative man. And we’ve learned a lot from him. - You don’t seem nervous. - We’re not nervous. We’re ready for the show because we’re enjoying it. We’re not nervous because it’s something we’re living. We’re very happy when we do this. And we wish to share this with people, with the Czech people. - Are they disciplined? - No. Not at all. It's a total mayhem now. They're neither precise nor spontaneous when necessary, because the repetition erased the original energy that used to be there. My brother saw it yesterday and he said that there was no trace of their drive in it. Now we'll see if I've chosen the right path, the right team, and if we can use their imperfections and turn them into a new quality. And how to use their spontaneity when it's gone. When the light goes out... ...that’s the beginning... ...and the lights will shine on you, and Eliseé will start. When the lights are turned on. This is exactly what I was talking about. OK, stop! Stop! Who is opening the screens, please? Who is opening the screens, please? During the rehearsal in the morning, one of you was opening one half and another one the second half. Guys, I can’t remember who. Please, make notes... I don’t know how to do this better. When you see your friend’s distracted, tell him to focus. People should help each other. That’s what you call a team. We have to support each other. Guys, you around Gisubizo, make him scream. If he's not loud enough, poke him. Yes, you can even punch him if necessary. Or if you see somebody’s hesitating to get on the stage, push him right in, he’ll deal with the rest. They’re drawing some marks over there, pay attention. Whoever starts has to be ready, so does the person after him. Otherwise, we’re done for. As for circus techniques, we have that down. As for gymnastics, that's our thing. We’re okay there. Have you noticed any errors in our performance? I guess not. There hasn't been any so far. Abuba, please, Abuba, if you are... Stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop! Abuba, this is not a concert, OK? It’s a theatre piece, you have to watch Naim, because Naim stopped, but you continued singing! It’s impossible, come on! Be with us, OK? Third part. - We need to hear Abouba’s voice. - Stop! Sorry Naim, sorry. Abuba, use the microphone, please! Everybody’s waiting for you to start singing! Holly sh...! You... Am I not being clear or what?! If you don’t wanna sing, if you don’t wanna play, someone else can do it! But I don’t have time to wait for you! Now, let’s take a five-minute break, I need to... Thank you very much guys! A five-minute break. Don’t leave this marquee. - Mom! I got a tylopilus! - Mum... Eh, dad says it’s a boletus! Mom, I found a mushroom! An edible one! Mom! I've got an edible mushroom! Come here, mom! Beautiful! - Is it edible? - It’s good to scrape the roots... ...back on the ground... ...because then... more mushrooms can grow out of it. Give it to Kristýna. Kristýna, I’ve found one too! Yes! Nice! What's this? It's a cap of a little boletus, isn’t it? We don't have a single suspicious looking mushroom. They're all suspicious looking! We're picking only one kind! Well, you'd pick anything. Yellow ones, white ones, pink ones... And this is...? My sister! - You know this song? - Yeah. - Sing! Guys, I’d like to... I’d like to have this in the show today. - I’ll find a pl... - In the show? - Yes. I’ll find a place for it. You have to do it just like this, OK? Yes, like this, but in the show! What about the T-shirts? Anaclet complained his T-shirt was too big. He wants Gisubizo’s. What size does Gisubizo have? They didn’t check your size or what? He’s size “S” but that one's his. I like wearing skinny clothes. You know, sometimes I get up at around 2 a.m. and find Anaclet doing push-ups. OK, in they go! About five minutes. Actors, get ready, one minute left! You can lace it now.
