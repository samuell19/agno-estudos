"I miss you very much." The phone... Police? I'm at 64 Prince Edward Place. A man-sized white thing... fell on my terrace! Send someone over now! Calm down, Miss! Is it an illegal immigrant? He doesn't look like one but he's scary... all white and slimy and he has wings on his back. What? White, slimy and winged? Sure, Miss, don't worry! We'll send out our best team and winged SWAT to you. It's stormy out, get some sleep. Margie... She has a new number? Sister, where are you? Toronto? You moved there a year ago? Speak, are you a monster? Neither human nor bird. Can't fool me with those wings. Speak! Are you man or monster? I'm an angel! And I'm a 3-year-old. Angels exist? Yes, I'm one! Why'd you fall on my terrace? I was caught in the storm while flying. The rain brought me down. A stupid lie! I'll release you! Fly, and I'll believe. I can't! Why not? You're an angel! I hurt my wing. When will you be able to fly? Have you any mercurochrome? What? You'll return to heaven? Yes! But I must wait for the Holy Door to open. What door? The Holy Door! Like the door to your home. When is that? I don't know! What? You plan to live here? I don't have extra food for you. I don't have to eat! I survive on love. Love? So when I showed some kindness, you smile! I won't give you love. You'll starve! Take me out to find some. Why should I? Leave tomorrow! Or I'll call the police! They'll use you for research. You'll return to heaven someday? If I let you stay... can you take something for me? Sure, what? I'm not telling. Better? Where are your wings? I folded them away. And the clothes? I found them here. You went through my things? I can't be naked. This isn't heaven. There's no free lunch here. You must pay to stay. Do these fit? Serves you right! Let me tell you. Crocodiles in the Amazon are fierce. They can tear apart a water buffalo in seconds. Their hide... is bullet-proof! You know how. Hunters get them? They wait for the crocs to yawn and shoot into the mouths. That's how they do it. Lucky you, your husband takes you places. Mine hasn't in 10 years. The farthest we went was Shenzhen. I'm from there. So you went home! Hi! Athena! This is my new assistant... Hello, my name is Angel! In the last class I told you there are about 40,000 scents. Even our bodies give out scents. Sometimes when you're just walking, you'll smell a scent that makes you think of someone. You may have forgotten his face but the scent will stay with you. Why? Because you don't forget scents. Now I'll show you how to use aromatic oils. Tell me your problems. I'll blend something for you. Miss Chen... I've been dumped. I want to find the scent of my youth. I want to be carried away... to enter into... that floating feeling of... transcending worldliness. Essential oil of lavender. Lavender eases pain and tension. If you're unhappy, lavender can help. Now, we will relax. And inhale deeply. Class is over, stop it. Clean up! Okay! Your friend? Only the small one. I know Athena well. Call me Chow Chow. What's your name? Angel! Andrew? No, Angel! Like in the sky. Angel! I live alone next door. I mean, with my dog. He's also Chow Chow, but different. Call out "Chow Chow!" That's him! Say it tenderly: Chow Chow. That's me. You look familiar. Have we met? On a flight! A flight? Yes, on a flight! You were going to Thailand. You had a window seat on the plane. I was flying by, so we met. Perhaps you've forgotten. If you could see... then the planes were... very close? Your water. Thanks! You're kidding. Just one bowl? How about him? Take him out if you like. We'll talk outside. May I? Do the dishes first. Sure! I'll squeeze the detergent. I'm just curious. There are cobwebs on her door. Even files stay out. Now a handsome man is there. This water tastes good! I get a floating feeling! May I have another? A different kind? Give him a beer! I know! She cut her web! And you got caught! I'm an angel who fell into her home. You're an angel? Then I'm your devil! Be serious! I'll show you! In the restroom. Cute underwear! Well, you didn't believe me. Wake up. I don't know my way home. Wake up! I'm going out! Every night! You can't handle alcohol! Almost there! You're very buff! And don't go out at night. Curb your hunger. Stay away from people with colorful shoes. You'll turn bad. You'll go to hell! Hear me? Don't take my things down there. Only people with no love go to hell. You mean me? How do you know? Then give him some. He needs love, not money. You know that? He's my friend! He flew into a lighting rod and fell. Go ahead! How? Kiss him! You're crazy! I rest my case. What are you doing? Mopping! Now? Of course! Don't come over...get out! Please get up. I'll scrub the tub. No need...get out! Out! Now! Won't take long. No need, get out! I'm going! Go! I'm going out! Go ahead! Go! What was that about? We never wear clothes up there. Did I dance well? Very good! Yours! You're already buying the food. I shouldn't! It's your share. You're a stranger here. Keep some money on you. Buy things you like to take home. It's duty free. Thank you! All those girls all over you... were you happy? Don't laugh! I survive only on their love. Will any love do? Want some supper? No, I'm full. Then I'll go home and chill! You get full doing that? You have to take off your shirt! What are you doing? Angel's demonstrating something. Yes! Fine, turn over and remove your shirt. Hurry, take it off... Quiet! Be gentle with oil massage. This is wrong. I'll show you the correct way. What's wrong? Practise by yourselves! Let's practise...hurry... Athena, are you alright? Fine! Go ahead! What's going on? Where did you get those shoes? I bought them! With what money? Why are you dressed like this? Who dressed you? It's for dancing. You went strip teasing? That's what you do every night? You're low and shameless! Degenerate! I told you to stay away from him! But I earned money and love and made those woman happy! Better than staying here and starving or freezing. You're cheating them. If you want real love... find a true love for yourself... not short one-night stands. What is true love? I thought you were pure. But you're... a whore! What else did you just say? You'll starve and freeze? I didn't mean it! Can you fly yet? Once you can, get out of here! What are you doing? Nothing, I tried to fly! Stay until you've recovered. And can you take more things? Sure! Thanks! I can fly! I can fly! Why are you crying so hard? I can't get it! I can't blend that scent. What scent? The one that made me feel happy and loved. You won't understand. What's bothering you? Tell me! Will gays go to hell? I told you, no! If I loved an angel... will I go to hell? What's the scent of happiness and love? Scent of happiness and love? They're happy and in love! You want to try? Try what? Caviar, more expensive than love. Did Athena have a boyfriend? You mean Andrew? Who's Andrew? He was with the SWAT team... tall, dark and handsome... buff, had a great personality. Like a big black bull on the African grasslands. He was good to Athena. Did you know him well? Of course! Slept with him all the time. I was around him since grade school! I followed him for 25 years! Wherever he went, I went. He made SWAT Team, I made Civil Corps. He had a Rottweiler, I had a Chow Chow. He moved in with Athena so I moved next door. Do you know! He snored like a bull. It's funny, listen. Your expression is funny. Andrew said that all the time. Where is he now? During a routine training exercise... he got heatstroke. He died on the way to hospital. That's why Athena's been unhappy. And so have I. How silly, everyone dies. Don't you know life goes in cycles? He died! But he may be in a happier place. Can he be happy without us? Only humans think that way. We're humans. We have feelings. We know what it is to lose something. How's that? It's... I can't describe it! It's just... I want to help her. - Miss? - Yes! Is there a scent to relieve depression? Yes! As well as worries and sleeplessness? Yes! And relieve distraction, nerves. Pent-up emotions, frowning faces. Hormonal imbalance and frigidity? Sure! This I must try! - Smell it! - May I? Come on, wake up! Did you use the aromatic oils? Did they work? Athena! When I used mine last night... I felt many... angels! Flying around my head... swooping to kiss me... on my face. What did you use? It's what you blended for the fat guy. That's geranium, good for sanitation and killing mosquitoes and germs. Miss Chen, tell me! Which scent arouses? You're interested in that? You know that... my husband has another woman. He seldom comes home now. For that abuse, let him smell gas. You can try... jasmine and ylang-ylang. Both are aphrodisiacs. Don't use too much, it works too well. I can't help you. Let me tell you. Peel an apple, cut it in half. Put it under your arms for an hour or two. When the apple mixes with your sweat... an aphrodisiac is formed. When Napoleon was frigid... that's what Josephine did. Really? Yes! I'm busy. I want to go home early. Not feeling well? I'm fine! Can you take some things back? Sure! What took you so long? And the lights are off. I was cooking, it's ready. You hurt your arms? No, I'm fine. Why such a spread tonight? Yes, cheers! Some fruit? No! Are you alright? Fine, why? Your face is all red! Yes! I don't know why... my heart's beating...really fast. Can you listen? No, it's normal! Listen on this side! What's with you? Can you change the light bulb? Must I? You were hiding an apple. Eat them whenever you want. I never said you couldn't. No need to sneak around. I saved it for dessert! So, go ahead! Okay! That's dirty, get a new one. My nose is congested tonight. I'll take a peppermint bath. What are you doing? What? My leg! My leg! Get up! Get up! My leg! Sorry about last night. I was starving! It's fine! But next time you're hungry, go to Chow Chow! Will you blend a scent for me? Sure! What scent would you like? The scent of heaven! Scent of heaven? I miss the scent of my home. I've never been to heaven. Heaven is a place with no tears! It's full of the scent of love. It makes you feel gentle, like flying. I'll try. Nothing like it. I can't help you. I'll take you somewhere. Come on! What is this place? Sit here! Sit here? Why? You'll see! Sit still! Sit tight! Is it like flying? Yes! Just like it! This is fun! Was it fun? Yes! - What? - Come with me! No, I hate heights! Don't worry! The world is so beautiful from there. But...I'm scared! Not too high! Alright! Enough! Look! Don't... Enough... Enough! Look! How beautiful! Sit tight! What are you doing? No! Look, there! What do we do now? Will we die if we fall from here? I don't think so! You won't, you can fly! Help! Screaming doesn't help! All we can do is... wait for someone to help us. Wait for someone... You're an angel. You know magic. Bring us down! Hurry! I'm an angel, not a witch. I don't know magic. What do we do? It's night, and we're up here. I need the restroom. We're so high up. No one will see you. Do it! No! Not here? Don't look down at all. - Alright! - Don't look! - Don't look! - Alright! - It's gorgeous down there! - Where? There! There... That's Wanchai, the Convention Centre. Wanchai! And there? That's Tsim Sha Tsui! I used to live there. Where did you live? There! There? What's that? The planet Yululwacha! - Yululwacha? - Yes! I've never heard of it! 150,000 light years from Balmobana. The universe is so vast! Humans know so little. Do you know where my boyfriend is? He died! He went to a faraway place. Why don't you get a new boyfriend? I can't forget his scent. I want it back. Do you know the best human trait? What's that? To be able to smell your lover beside you when you wake up in the morning. But scents will fade no matter where he is. When you think of him... it's as if he returned to your side, right? Can you tell me where he is? He's far, far away! Can you take me there? I wonder if he got my balloons. Am I being foolish? Why are you in my home? It's Angel's birthday. We're celebrating. Come join in. Come join us. It's your birthday? Yes! You have birthdays? Of course! How old are you? Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday to... Hi, Athena? I'm Tiger! I'm Lion! Your home is great. But full of trash. Excuse me! Hi! Excuse me! I'll help you! I can handle it! - I'll get the door! - No need! You have so many shoes! I like that pair. Nothing we can do. You bought all these shoes. Can't you wear them? I just want those! You're working against me. Wasn't last night bad enough? I was trying to help you. I threw out those shoes. How could you take my shoes?! This photo is mine. Who's in the picture? Youth that's been lost. No wonder you want the scent of youth. You were beautiful. The past is the past. At least you had it. But I wasted it. How? You have a loving husband who takes you on trips. I don't have a husband. When I was young, I had a crush on a classmate! I imagined we'd get married. I hoped he'd love me one day so I waited... year after year. I never saw him with other girls. That's how I wasted my youth. Then I found out he likes guys. But time doesn't return. So who takes you to see the animals? Discovery Channel! What else is there to do at night? It gets boring! Athena, did you fight with Angel? Angel is handsome and good-hearted. When you look at him... your pupils dilate. That's a reflex action when you like someone. Let me tell you. Baboons in the Namibian Jungle do that while mating. You can lie to others but never to yourself. Discovery Channel will be on soon. - I'll go now! - Alright! Where's Angel? Is he gone? When? I forced him out, but not on purpose! Why? What are you doing? We fought over Andrew! And now over Angel! Why did you force him out? I didn't fight with you! He just fell on my terrace! Just fell? On whose side? Perhaps! You dragged him from my side. Heaven pitied me! It sent me an angel after Andrew left! And you dragged him to your home. He's not yours! No? Then why'd you come here for him? Why did you come? I'm wasting my time! Hurry or we'll lose out! Hurry! Where is he? There! Hurry, Chow Chow! Hurry! Don't let her get there first! I found the shoes. I know now what true love is! Where have you been? I finally learned human things. I understood how humans feel! Some things you don't miss until you lose them. I was flying up there thinking I saw things clearly but many things I had to find out for myself. So you have to stay here? You know, there are many more things you must learn. Like? Like! Sugar is sweet! Flowers smell nice. All things grow in spring. And love? News from the Vatican. Pope John Paul II will open the Holy Door during the Midnight Mass this Christmas. It symbolizes the door of heaven opening. The last time it opened was in 1985. Over 100,000 are expected to attend. It's time to go back. Congratulations! Can you take me? Where to? The Vatican! I'll ride out on the first light after the Mass. How? I can't fly! We'll take a plane. What happened to you? I was looking for you! You're back! That's great! Great! I'm leaving tomorrow. So soon? Tomorrow, great! So, good night! Good night! I'm taking all this to him? Yes! I have one more thing! Can you come with me? Where to? You'll see. Sure! You won't go to hell for loving an angel. Loving people go to heaven. For you! Can you... take something to Andrew? Take this expression! I will take it! I'm going! Goodbye! Goodbye! Smells wonderful! Oh, lavender! Stay here! This is our most beautiful lavender this year. I offer it to you with pleasure! Thank you! Take these to him! He'll be happy to get it! You came all this way for these flowers for him? Yes! Let's go! Why the tears? I don't know! I really don't! You said there are no tears in heaven. I'm actually an Angel of Happiness! I've never shed tears. My work is to go to the people with the most tears in the world and help them. Do you know... I've never met anyone who cried so much for love. I thought I could help you forget the past, stop the tears. But I failed. And now I'm crying. I think... I may be... in love with you! No! You'll be fine. You're an angel. You'll go to heaven. I'll never forget this. Don't you remember? You must take this for me. If I don't make it back... don't worry! I just won't be an angel! I'll go somewhere else! Why? You'll be fine. You will go back. Next time, if not this. The gate will open. Remember the place you wanted to go? Close your eyes. It's him! I smell it! It's him...Andrew! Hey...hey?...hey! Don't die! Take these! It's really you! No, I'm not a bad guy! I was painting my sign and I fell down. I own the restaurant downstairs. I'll pay for the damage. Don't worry! Restaurant owner? You don't believe me? I'll show you. Come on! Come see! Wait! I designed, decorated and painted this place all my myself! You see me all the time. I do? Yeah! You just never noticed. I smell like paint. No! Like an angel! An angel? It must be. Is your name Angel? Angelo! How did you know? Michaelangelo! Michaelangelo? Yeah! Oh, sorry I whistled at you. Buy me dinner, all is forgiven. Sure! How about there? Alright! Why not now? Fine! Okay! Come in! May I, in house slippers? Sure! Where'd you get those boots? My boots? I found them. You did? Yes, on my last trip to Italy! I found them on a train.
