Come on, you women. Take the big one. My back is acting up. It's my turn to use the tub first, Dad. Be fair. People who drink forfeit their rights. Let him be. Did you have a good day? Where's the cotton gabardine? We have customers. I didn't sell it. Wait. I'll warm the soup. They lost their packman. Solomon can go. Tell this old fool to shut up. I can't concentrate with his braying. You've got a tongue, Solomon. You sort it out. You stinking little fish. May God forgive you. Finish up those accounts. Tomorrow your father needs you to sell some cotton. Thank God. No, thank you very much. - What you got there, then? - Cottons. Samples. You want to see? What's this? It's for Mrs. Evans. For the girls. I'm going to make up dresses. And this? It's nothing. Something the new packman left, that's all. It might suit Bronwen, don't you think? Yes, Ma. It's no use for chapel, though. You wouldn't have the use of it. You be careful. Those packmen will talk the hind leg off a donkey. Yes, Dad. Send him packing next time. Yes, Dad. Solomon, come home. We're finished. Come home. In a minute. Let's get away from this goyische place. It's a long way. Wait here. Interfering little sod. Sleep well. Good night, Ma. Wine and spirits... Are the poison of the weak. Who was the famous explorer... who was a total abstainer? Doctor Livingstone. Come on, John. Don't miss your instruction. Now then. All together. Long may temperance be our guide. And long may Wales be pure Wales. If drunkenness is our guide... Pure Wales will be a darkened Wales. Where have you been? Uncle's long started. If we do not understand the works of its greatest author, Charles Dickens? Who is it? No one, Dad. The butcher. He's gone. Go back to sleep. Where were you? I went for a walk. They had stones this time. It isn't Russia here. Just a few stupid children. Not everyone is bad. Children they may be, but who puts these thoughts in their minds? All right, I'll find out who it is. I'll talk to their parents. Don't go stirring up more trouble. A goy is a goy. Not all are bad. Of course not. We have many respectable people here. They're not our people, is all. They are different. Different ways. When you have your own shop, you'll see more. "To him who wishes to defile himself, the door is open. To him who wishes to purify himself... aid is given." I said I'd talk to them. Now, leave me alone. Simeon ben Lakish. You should learn it. Where did you get it? From the packman, Dad. I'll pay for it. I'll do extra for Mrs. Evans. There is no extra. Not in this house. Not with the strike coming. You want to earn money whoring now? No, Dad. No. Take it back. Get your money back. I can't, Dad. Not now. I want it. Let her keep it, Idris. The money is spent. Let her keep something for once. I'll slip off then, Ma. Just a half hour with the boys. Here's your beau, Gaenor. Sorry I can't stop, Noah. Will you be coming to the meeting tomorrow, Gaenor? I just sing, Noah. I'm not good at organization. You must come. We could use your help and your support. I'll see what I can do. I clean up on a Thursday. I'm sure we can arrange something, Noah. God bless you, Mrs. Rees. You know how much Gaenor means to us here. Is there something I should know? No, Ma. You were cool with Noah. Is something going on between you and that packman? He'd better come to tea next Sunday. Your father will want to meet him. I'm hungry. You'll have to wait. It's not far now. You should have asked somebody. They won't eat you. Ask these two. Do you know where this is, please? It's my uncle, Lansky. Lansky. Are you a Yid? Time to get back, Gaenor. They'll be wondering where you are. Yes, Ma. I'm going to Mrs. Williams. Don't forget to prepare the potatoes... and the bread, ready for baking. - No, Ma. - These pigs could do with a cleanup. Yes. If they vote for a strike today, you can say good-bye to him. Are you feeling all right, Gaenor? I'm fine. Really. You can talk to me. As a friend. I want to help. I'm past helping, Noah. Don't involve yourself. I'm all right. Tired is all it is. Stand up... Gaenor Rees. A member of this congregation has a charge against you. Gaenor Rees is with child. She has been fornicating with a stranger. Is this true, Gaenor Rees? Remember, if you bear false witness in God's house... His punishment will be greater. It's true. I am with child. Shame on you, Gaenor Rees. You were an example of goodness to the young... and now, about you is the stench of deceit and evil. The trust those children placed in you... our trust... has been polluted. May God punish you accordingly. You will leave the chapel now. You will not sully it with your presence for six weeks. From the fellowship, you are banned forever. You are in the hands of your family, whom you have betrayed. May God lead you to true repentance. He's got to marry her. You won't keep that baby otherwise. You know that, don't you? Don't you? I'll make him marry her. She doesn't want him, Idris. She has her pride. Leave her alone. Pride. Pride be damned. You fool. Who will have you now? It's the strike. No one has money. No one wants glass. If it breaks, they stuff it up with paper. Don't be disheartened. Keep going around. Be a familiar face. Take cheap stuff. Darning material. Threads. Be generous. Let people know that they can trust you. In a strike, there is frustration. Hardship brings out the devil in people. Don't let them say the Jews kept away. It will be over soon, please God. Then, you will have a shop and customers. Yes, Dad. You can start going to chapel again now. It's not the fellowship, but it's something. There's more darning than wool in these heels. You can't hide your disgrace from God. I need to go. I can't hold it in anymore. Gaenor, are you all right? Coming, Dad. Come and share a prayer of thanks. We're going back to work. Did we win? We didn't lose. Put it like that. Each generation shall put a tassel on the corner of their clothes. Why is it always a Friday night? Please, God, there will be peace now. There are too many children going hungry. They come in here with junk... and it's hard not to give them something. It's for you. I'll be back soon. Come and sit down. Take it easy, man. You'll scare that baby out before it's time. Let it come. That'd save a great deal of trouble. What are you talking about? We're just getting on our feet... and the docks are out and the railway boys. There'll be no coal moving. We're like puppets on a string. We'll be back where we started. Why are you killing yourself? Out all hours. If no one is buying, stay home a bit. - Bless me too, Father. - What? Include me in your blessing. Please. It's for children. You aren't a child anymore. I'm your son. I'll always be your son. It's for a child. You are an adult. Let that be the end of it. Philip is past his bar mitzvah. Thank you, Mother. Thank you, Father. We have no milk for children... or feed for animals. We cannot nourish the sick. We cannot, even in this citadel of coal... give warmth to our elders. Our people create the wealth. Our people are suffering... while others grow fat... on the proceeds of our shame. Go home and board up your shop. Last night there were riots in Tredegar against the Jews. They are afraid tonight it will spread here. That's right. Shops were looted. Houses too. Isaac, you should find somewhere else to stay. Surely you aren't taking it seriously. You're well-respected here. This isn't Russia. For God's sake, be quiet. They mustn't know we are here. Everything. Everything. Don't be a fool. Do you want to be killed? Let me go, for God's sake. See what they are doing? We will lose everything. You see what they are like. No. You are wrong. Don't say that. Do you think I don't know what's going on? I know every house in this valley, and I know what they are saying. Tell me it isn't true. Get off me. It's my own life! You can't control me! If you go with this girl... you will be dead to us. We will say Kaddish over you. They didn't touch the books. See? God is good. They didn't harm the books. This is for Gaenor. What shall I do with it? I'll make sure it gets to the right place. Translate for me. Maybe she wants money. No, please. I am sorry, my dear. I can see you are an honest girl. I am glad Solomon found an honest girl. You'll get over it. You both will get over it. Love, when you are young... Iove comes and goes. You have a long life to live yet. It will heal. Be good. I know you will. Go in, you two. Don't make a fuss. You'll catch a cold out here. I'll be all right. Funny not to be knitting. I didn't hear anything. Did you? No. Hello, Sam. Hello, my princess. How are you? Cold. Better? No.
