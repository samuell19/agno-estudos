- Um, why didn't you call me last week? I said I missed you. Why didn't you call me last week? - Hmm? Yeah, I know, babe. I'm sorry. - Well? I asked you a question. - Jeff? - God, this pain is incredible. God! Don't worry, it's all right. It's been coming and going for the last week. - Have you made an appointment with the doctor? It could be serious. - I went in two days ago and he couldn't find anything wrong with me, so he's running a bunch of tests or something. - And? - I gotta go back tomorrow and get the results. - I'm scared. What if it's something serious? - Oh, no, no. - I don't know what I'd do if you got sick. - Don't sweat it, it's probably just a stomach infection. You know my diet's nothing to scream about. - Yeah. Yeah, mine too. Junk food city. Have you seen your psychiatrist lately? - Two weeks ago, and he told me I'm as crazy as they come. - Seriously. I mean, are you making progress? I know how you feel about women. - Well, what do you think? Are my kisses better than two weeks ago? - Jeff. - Come on, babe, let's get it on! - Are you crazy? - Someone will see us! - There's no one up here but the birds, baby. Come on. - Jeff! Aw, Jesus. Just take me home, all right? Just take me home. You drive, okay? - Jeff, let me take you to a hospital. You really look sick. - No, goddammit! Just take me home! Get going, now! - Jeff, I'm afraid I have some alarming news for you. - Well, go ahead, I can take it. Come on. - Well, when we took your blood sample the other day, I routinely had it tested for a number of things. I also told the lab to test for the AIDS virus. And, um... And I'm afraid the test came out positive for AIDS. I'm sorry. - Putting me on, right? - This could be a misdiagnosis, right? I mean, come on, Doc. It's me we're talking about. - I'm afraid not. When I received the positive test results, I had the lab screen your blood a second time and it confirmed the first test. Jeff, we have medicines now to slow the progress of AIDS. New advances are being made all the time toward a cure, and soon there'll be one. - But no cures yet, right? I mean, no matter how you look at it, it's a death sentence. - Not necessarily. If you take care of yourself and eat the right foods, you- - Are there any cures? I mean, did anybody ever live from it? Huh? - Well, no, but... - No, no, no, no! The bottom line is I have AIDS and I'm a dead man! - Jeff! - Get away from me! Huh? Or I might even give you AIDS. This can't be happening. This can't be happening! Oh, god. This can't be happening. Oh, god. God! Hello? - Hello, Jeff. Are you coming back to work? Yeah, the boss wants to know where you are. He said if you want to take three-hour breaks to do it on your own time. - All right, all right, all right. Just tell him I'll be in in a few. Bye. - This is Jeff Roberts' file. That young man who was just in here. - Mm-hmm? - He has AIDS. - Oh. - I'd like you to call him tomorrow and give him these referral numbers for some counseling. I think he's kind of emotionally unstable. - Hey, Jeff, old buddy. How's it going? - Sup? - Aw, nothing much. Hey, you don't look so hot. Everything okay at the doctor's? - Yeah, sure, everything's cool. Just gave me a prescription for some stupid vitamins or something. - Oh, great. With all the junk I eat, should've got me one too. - I need a special favor. - I'm all ears, go ahead. - There's this patient of mine, Jeff Roberts. He's just been diagnosed with AIDS. He's only 19. - God, how terrible! - Well, what's worse is his father and I are old friends and the kid has a history of mental difficulties. - How can I help? - It's crucial that he see a professional right away. He's kind of emotionally unstable right now and I think he might hurt himself or someone else. - Aw, man. Looks like the shit's gonna hit the fan. - So. Half an hour isn't enough for lunch, huh? You gotta take three hours. I have a rush shipment that's supposed to have been out of here an hour ago. Hey, I'm talking to you. You do that again, and you're gonna be standing in the unemployment line. Do you understand me? - Fuck! - Man, he really reamed you. What a dick! - No, no, no. It's cool, man. That son of a bitch will get his. - What's that supposed to mean? You gonna knock him off or something? - Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch. You just got put on my hit list. You're gonna die. - Come on, Jeff! Let's get that truck loaded. You want to keep your job? What is that? Some kinda grocery list? - No, it's just a piece of paper, Ron. - Oh, I get it. Some kind of big secret, right? - Yeah. Oh, hey, listen. I need you to do me a favor. - Screwing off again, huh? - Aw, man. - No, we were just- - Pick your check up on Friday. Scram! - Son of a bitch. - Just what he needed, to catch you goofing off again! - Shit. I'm coming! - Hello, are you Jeff Roberts? - Yeah, who are you? - I'm Mary Whitman with the County Health Department. - Look, I know why you're here, lady, okay, and I don't a goddamn shrink for my problem, so just beat it. - You don't understand, Jeff. We're worried about you. There's something we need to discuss. I spoke with Dr. White yesterday. He told me that you were despondent. He was worried. He thought maybe I could help. - Help? No one's gonna help me with my problem, lady, okay? I got AIDS. AIDS! I'm as good as dead now, it's just a matter of when. Don't you understand that? - Did you think that might solve your problem? - Maybe. Listen, I don't have time to talk, so would you just beat it? - Jeff, do you know where you contracted AIDS? - Get the fuck outta here! - I mean, the county has- - Leave me alone! - The county has a right to know if you know! - Isn't it true that AIDS can be transmitted if the blood from someone who's infected is mixed with the blood from someone who's not? - That's true. - Come here, let me cut you and you can see what it's like! - Excuse me, Dr. White. There's a Ms. Whitman here to see you. She says she's from the County Health Department. - Okay, please send her in. - Okay. - Hello, Mary. Sit down. - It's about Jeff Roberts. - You talked with him? - I did more than that. I went to see him. - And? - And can't you see that I'm still shaking? - What happened? - Well, like I said, I went to talk to him, hoping that I could be of some help, and I'm afraid he's very dangerous. I tried to talk to him. He told me to get out. And just when I was getting ready to give up and go, he asked me if AIDS could be transmitted through blood products. If the infected person mixed blood with a person who didn't have the virus. And I explained that it was possible. And he pulled a knife from his pocket and he cut himself, and told him he was going to cut and infect me! - I can't believe that. - Who are you calling? - I think the police should know about this. - No, Robert, please. He's angry. I mean, wouldn't you be a little off center if you had a death sentence looking you in the face? - I'm gonna die soon, all right? All right? I'm gonna die, okay? What, what do you want? - Why are you gonna die? Who told you that? - I got AIDS, okay? AIDS. - Who told you you had AIDS? - I'm a dead man. - Who said? - You think this is a joke? - No, this is not a joke! Tell me! They could be wrong. - Remember that night that we were up on Mulholland? - Yeah. - And I was feeling sick? You remember that? - Yeah. - Well, the next day I went to see the doctor and he ran some tests on my blood and all that shit. - Well, he can be wrong. They're always wrong. - No, no, no, because he didn't... No. He didn't believe himself, so he had it sent back and he had it tested again. It's true, I got AIDS, okay? Now what do you want? You want some money, huh? Is that what you want? - No, no, no, no! - Then get away from me, okay? - No. - No, listen. I don't need... - Maybe you gave it- - Just get away from me! No, no, no. You're the one with the problem, okay? - Yeah, and maybe- - Just leave me alone. Leave me alone! - Jeff! - Tanya, you little whore. You're the one who gave me AIDS, aren't you? So it's logical that you should top the list. It had to have been you. I haven't slept with anyone for the last six months. - Yeah? - Hey, Tanya. Remember me? Jeff? - I don't know no Jeff. Now leave me alone. - Come on, I got 100 bucks says you remember me. - Well, maybe I do and maybe I don't. How'd you get my number? - Come on, don't you remember? You gave it to me. I gave you 10 extra bucks to come up to my place, and when we were finished, then you gave it to me. - Yeah, you didn't wanna freak in the car, I remember. - Yeah. Well, listen. I got 100 for you if we can get together tonight. - I ain't coming back over to your place. You take too long. And besides, I had to take a taxi when we got done and it cost me the 10 extra dollars you gave me. No, I got company coming. Some other time. - Come on. 10 minutes, 100 bucks. - 10 minutes? I've got an alarm and I'm setting it the second you walk through the door. - That's okay by me. See you in a few. - Come on, Don Juan, get up. Party's over. Hello, Jimmy. - It's Jeff, not Jimmy. - Jeff, Jim, they're all the same. - What's that supposed to mean? - So you got the money? Well, come on, big spender. Let's see it. All right, lover boy. This has gotta be quick. I got another trick in 15 minutes. - Don't worry, it'll be quick. Quicker than you ever imagined. - Come on, get your clothes off. You got 10 minutes. - You know, I went to the doctor's office yesterday. You know what he told me? - That's you're problem, babe, and we all got problems. You got seven minutes. You wanna- - You're the slut that infected me with AIDS! - Get away from me! You're crazy! - I know you're the one who infected me! - No, I'm not! Get away before I call the cops! - I think it was you, you little bitch. - No! Ow! - Well, even if it wasn't you, welcome to the AIDS card-carrying club. It's nice to know I'll have a friend in hell! - No! No, no. No! No! - What happened? - What's going on here? - What, are you the manager here? - Yeah, I have been for 10 years, and I can tell you that lady over there has been nothing but trouble. - Okay. - Is all the blood gone? - Well, no, there's still a little bit around. We're just sealing the wound. - Please get rid of the blood. - We're just sealing the wound. Just relax, ma'am. Okay, I'm just gonna give you a little sedative here. - No! Oh no, god! - Stay calm, stay calm. Stay calm. There. - If you wanna know what I think, I think she's a hooker. - Oh, I see. - There's a bloody syringe over there on the floor. - Thanks. Don't touch it till the detectives get here. - All right. - We'll give you a call if we need you. - What's going on? We heard there was a homicide here. - No homicide, Sergeant. The lady over there was stabbed with a syringe. - Oh, great. - Ouch. - The needle's over there on the floor. I think someone thought she was a pincushion. - She gonna be all right? - Yeah, I think so. I told her to follow up with her doctor in a couple days. - Thank you. - Aw, Jesus. Detective Sterns. This is my partner, Detective Rogers. And what's your name? - Cut the crap, you know my name. Now what do you want? - We need to ask you a few questions. We can either do it her or we can do it downtown. It's your choice. Who stuck you with the syringe? - Some guy. - What's his name? - Look, I don't know. Just some guy I met. - A trick? - What's that supposed to mean? - You know what it means. - Listen, lady, don't be difficult, okay? We can always take you in on a charge of pandering. - Ha! You got nothing on me. All right, all right, all right, just joking. What do you wanna know? - The name of the person who stuck you. - Look, I told you. It's some guy I met six months ago, okay? He called me up, he said he'd give me 100 for a quickie. So I said yeah. I mean, I gotta eat, right? - And? - And, and he came over, he gave me the money, I went in the bathroom, I come out, and he grabs me. You know? I thought he was gonna kiss me or something. But instead he's got this needle, he sticks it up against my neck. - What did he say then? - Something about how maybe I gave him AIDS or something and he's gonna take me to hell with him. - Sounds like a Looney Tune all right. Better take this down to the lab and have 'em check it out. - You don't think this guy injected me with AIDS, do you? - Don't know. Look, I would suggest that you go to see your doctor and get some tests taken. And then, when you do, to come to the precinct and look at some photos, tomorrow. - So you think this guy's really injecting people with AIDS? - Well, how should I know? I mean, there's a flock of crazy people out there, and maybe there's one just crazy enough. He finds out he's got the AIDS virus and it sounds like a good idea to him to take some people with him. Whole thing makes me sick. - If this tests positive for AIDS, we're gonna be in a lot of problems. - Yeah, like the media wouldn't have a field day with this one. - Well, we should tell the captain then. Keep a lid on it. We're gonna have a lot of scared people out there. - Yeah. Look what it's doing to me. What are we doing here? - It's 7:30. - Did you hear me? What are we doing here? - Look, I have to see Jaworski about something. - Well, about what? And why in some deserted parking lot? - He said it had something to do with his wife's ex. - There he is now. - Sterns, Rogers, thanks for coming. - What's up, Jaworski? You got something against meeting in a public place? - Steph! - Look, I got a small problem here. - Well, ask away, Jaworski. We don't have all day. You know, we got other things we gotta do. - What's wrong with you? You on the rag this week or something? - You son of a bitch! I'm- - Come on, Steph, cool it. What's up, buddy? - I need to ask for a small favor and I was hoping you might be able to help me out. - Okay, shoot. - It's my wife's ex-husband. Drunk bastard came back to Los Angeles from Phoenix about a month ago. He's a real scumbag. Used to beat her senseless, no reason at all. Anyway, for about the last week or so he's been calling the house. You know, during the day. He's threatening to take her back to court and get custody of the kids. - Well, he's a drunk, right? - Yeah. - Did you ever hear of a court giving custody to a drunk? - No, but I don't want to take a chance. - Well, have you told him to lay off? - That's the problem. I'm too close to it. If Janet ever found out I laid hands on him, it... And besides, if the department ever found out that I roughed him up... - What do you want us to do? - No. What do you want him to do? - You wanna take a walk or something and let the man talk? - I need you to have a small talk with this creep Scalia. Impress upon him that my wife and me have had enough of his shit, and if he keeps up his current line of behavior, he's gonna end up at room temperature. - I refuse to have anything to do with this. Let me out. - The hell's her problem? - Who knows? - Look, you be careful, huh? I don't want him to know who you are. Especially that you're a cop, okay? - Mind if I break an arm? - Break two if you like. Anyway. I owe you one. - You owe me a big one. And don't worry about Steph. I'll talk to her. - Thanks, buddy. You don't know what this means to me. - John Murphy. Could've been married to Jenny, you know. But you had to come along with your fancy cars and all your money, goddamn sweet-talk society. Son of a bitch! Poor Jenny. 'Cause she's gonna know what it feels like to be a widow. - When was the last time you talked to her, Mr. O'Connor? - Last week, but she calls me every morning at 11 o'clock to talk. - Well, maybe she went out of town for a couple of days to visit some relatives. - She doesn't have any relatives, and she can't travel 'cause she has arthritis. - Joe, can I see you a minute? - Sure. All right, Mr. O'Connor. We'll send someone out to check on her, okay? - Bad news. - What is it? - The lab test on the syringe came back positive for the AIDS virus. - Great. Captain, can we see you for a minute? Remember the assault involving a syringe the other night? - Yeah, what about it? - Well, Stephanie just received results on the syringe used in the attack. It's positive for AIDS. - Oh, shit. - Are you gonna authorize a lid on this thing? You know what'll happen if the media gets wind of it. - You're damn right I will. Who else knows about this besides you two and the lab? - Well, no one. - Are you sure? - Mm-hmm. - Let me speak to Griffith. Griffith, this is Captain Griswold down at Homicide. How many people down there know about the test on the syringe? All right, listen. We want to clamp a lid on this thing, for obvious reasons. Can I count on you to seal up your end? Good. Thanks. Any leads on this sicko? She see the guy? Get a look at him? - Well, she didn't remember anything substantial about the trick, just that he was in his 20s or 30s, average height, weight, et cetera. - I don't need to tell you how important it is that we find this guy before he hits again. - No, Captain, we've already got that figured out. - Good. Find this guy and bring me his head on a plate. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Listen, if Marge is gonna continue to nag you about this, I'll just find someone else to go to the game with me. - Hey, watch the paint. - What's that contraption? - This, my dear sister, is the newest in multi-band radios. Do you like it? - Yeah. - I was browsing through Radio World last weekend. I couldn't help myself. - Listen, I can think of at least 100 people who would love to go to that game with me. - Hey, I'm not gonna miss the game and that's it. - No, I'll get it. You know, the only time this thing ever rings is when we're on a break. Murphy's law, I guess. No, hold on a second. Guess who. - Jeez. Yeah, what's up? - Sterns? Figured I'd better call you on the cellular instead of the radio. The less ears that know about this, the better. - Wait, stop it there. What's that? - What's what? - Shh! Listen, turn it up. - The AIDS jabber struck again. He just finished sticking a businessman over at Elyse's Cafe at 47th and Park. - Jesus, did you hear that? - Just the cops having a conversation. Isn't this baby great? It's got seven bands, including cellular. - Hell, who knows? Just get over there and check it out. If this is the same guy- - Yeah, 10-4. We're on our way. - What's going on? - Got another jabber victim. - Oh, god. - Okay, the cops, but was all that about someone being stuck with a needle containing the AIDS virus? - Why not let the cops worry about it? That's what they're paid for. - You don't understand. I'm a reporter, and a new one at that. If I get me hands on a hot story, like maybe a secret police investigation... - What makes you so sure it's a hot story? - Well, you heard the police captain say he was calling on a cellular phone instead of the police radio because he didn't anyone to hear their conversation. - So? - So if this was public information, why not use the police radio in the car? - Yes, Mr. Scalia. You can bet I'll check into this. And thank you for bringing it to my attention. If any one of my men had anything to do with this, I can assure you he will be disciplined. Jaworski. I just got off the phone with one Alex Scalia. You know him? He told me he used to be married to your wife, and that just yesterday afternoon somebody paid him a visit, told him to lay off your wife. You don't happen to know who that could be, do you? Did you send someone around to see Mr. Scalia? - Captain, that creep Scalia has been bugging my wife for weeks now. He keeps calling and calling and calling and calling- - Captain, can I see you and Jaworski in your office, please? - Yeah, let's go. Jaworski? So you wanna tell me what's going on here? I'm getting a little tired of playing charades. - Well, Captain, see- - No, Phil. Let me explain. This puke Scalia is my wife's ex. He's been calling the house almost every day, threatening to sue for custody of the kids again. Captain, he's no damn good. He's a drunk and he used to beat my wife senseless. - I can vouch for the drunk part. I went to visit him at 10 a.m. He answered the door with a beer in his hand and was bombed. - So let me hypothesize here. Jaworski, you told Scalia to call? - That scumbag Scalia is- - That's enough, Jaworski. So Sterns, you went to pay a little visit. - And I told him to cool it. - What does that mean? - I simply told him to lay off of Jaworski's wife and stop creating problems. - And that includes roughing him up? - Well, he was being an ass, so I pushed him a little. - So you pushed him a little bit? Wouldn't you call that using excessive force? What do you think I oughta do about this? You know, I can suspend the two of you without pay. But under the circumstances, I probably would've done the same thing. All right, you guys, get outta here. We got a lot of work to do. - Thanks, Captain! - Yeah. - Listen, no more visits, okay? Leave it up to the courts, all right? - Detective Sterns. - Detective Sterns, this is Judith Campbell, Channel 9 News. - Hello, Judith Campbell from Channel 9 News. What can L.A.'s finest do for you? - I have a source who tells me the police department may have a psychotic running around town. - Lady, that is the understatement of the year. We have thousands of them. - But my understanding is this psycho is running around sticking people with needles that may contain the AIDS virus. - Uh, Ms. Campbell, something just came up. Uh... - Captain, hi. There's a problem on line one with a Judith Campbell. I think we need you out here. - Detective Sterns, let's cut the crap. You know as well as I there's a nut out there who's stabbed two people so far. Chances are the needles used in the attack have been contaminated with the virus. - Line one. Hello, Ms. Campbell? - This is Captain Griswold. I want to know how in the hell you got information on this investigation. - That's a long story, but believe me, Captain, it was in a perfectly legal way. - Meaning what? - Meaning I know this thing is hush-hush, and if you wanna keep it that way, you should cooperate with me. - This is police business. It's none of your concern. - It concerns all the citizens of L.A., who have a right to know about this sicko. - I'm sorry, I can't help you. - I'm afraid if you don't, you'll have to see it on the air tonight. - You realize if you do, you could be charged with interfering in a criminal investigation? - My lawyer tells me the First Amendment protects reporters from police harassment. - We don't need this to get out in the general population. The hysteria and panic will be unbelievable. - No, but Jesus Christ, we can't have a reporter, especially a TV reporter, interfere in a thing like this. - Between a rock and a hard place. Which one's worse? - All right, tell her we'll work with her on this one, but she's gotta keep a lid on it. - Uh, Ms. Campbell. We've decided for the benefit of everyone that it's better this thing is kept from the general population. You will you get your exclusive, but only when we've wrapped this thing up. Deal? - I think- - Listen, lady. Under the circumstances, that's all we're prepared to do. - No deal, cops. Watch the five o'clock news today. - That bitch! How in the hell did she find out about this thing? - Our top story tonight is a frightful one. Channel 9 News has learned the police are investigating attacks on two people by an assailant purported to be using a needle syringe filled with blood that may contain the deadly AIDS virus. The police are unwilling to confirm or deny the reports. And having been a reporter for a number of years, it appears as if the police are unwilling not only to inform the media but also the general public, who has a right to know that there might be a demented sicko out there ready to pounce on some poor, innocent, unsuspecting citizen. - You let my little secret out. You think that's gonna stop me, lady? You got put on the hit list in the top slot. - Shame on you, police. And to the nut running around doing this: well, all I can say, brother, is you're gonna rot in hell for this, and the sooner, the better. - If she were a man, I'd bust her in the chops. - She sure keeps her word. - This is Judith Campbell reporting for Channel 9 News in front of Metro Police Headquarters in Downtown Los Angeles. - Thought you'd want to know the results of the blood tests for the two latest stabber victims. - Yeah. - They both tested out positive. - I gotta call you back, okay? You mean to tell me that this creep is really injecting people with the AIDS virus? - We gotta get a collar on this guy fast. I'm not sure how we do it. We put two and two together. We got Jaworski and Santo at the County Health Department, checking on positive AIDS tests. Only problem with that is some doctors don't report that. Talk to that reporter Campbell, since she blew the lid on this whole thing. Maybe she can help us by alerting the public. Maybe someone out there knows this guy. Seen a stash of needles. Maybe he's a talker. Let's get this guy. - Got it. Let's hit it. - Oh my god, 4:20? Shit. Hey, Captain, what's up? - Steph, I'm afraid I've got some bad news. Can we come in? - All right. Okay, I'm sitting. So what's the emergency? - It's about Sterns. - What about Sterns? - There's been an accident. - Well, what kind of accident? What happened? Is he okay? - We don't have all the facts yet. We're still investigating. But it appears that Sterns was on his way home and he was hit head-on. - Oh my god, no. - The driver of the other car was killed instantly. He had an empty bottle of scotch found on the seat next to him. - And Sterns? - He was killed as well. - He had a wife and kids, right? - Yeah, dammit! It's always the cops near retirement who get the short end. In just about two years, he would've had his 20th. - He had all these plans, you know? He and his wife bought this farmland and they were gonna go live there. And now some drunk bastard comes along and just takes everything away. It's just not fair. - Where the hell is that snitch? Just like a snitch. You can never find one when you need one. - That's funny. I've never heard that before. Actually, I think you missed your calling. You should've been a stand-up comic. - Hey, asshole. Come here, I wanna talk to you. - Rick, no, don't. It's not worth it. - I mean, I'm not trying to be nosy. It's just I've worked with a lot of cops and they all seem to have all these marital problems. - Well, I guess you could include me an honorary member of that club. Things ain't too great on the home front. - You wanna talk about it? I pride myself, I'm a great listener. - Well, where do I begin? - You got a problem? Huh? Oh, you gotta defend your lady's honor, don't you? You gotta show her just how tough you are. - You're the problem, asshole. Why don't you watch where you're going, man? - Fuck you and the horse you rode in on! - Rick! Get off of him! Get off of him! Get off of him! - And I just spend 300 bucks on a vet bill for the dog. Heard enough? - Yeah, I think I have. Hold on. Yeah, this is Rogers. What's the address? 3187 Lincoln. We got on, we're outta here. Thank you. - Think that's our boy? - Are you the ones that were stabbed? I'll call you an ambulance. - No, no! - Uh, that's all right. We'll be all right. Look, we don't have any insurance. It's too expensive. - Okay. Can I get your names? - Susan Russell. My ex-boyfriend, Rick Larzaro. - Susan, you want to tell us what happened? - We were walking down the street and just trying to find what movie to see, and then all of a sudden this guy runs up to us and knocks us down. - Can you tell us what the assailant looked like? - I don't know. I guess he was like 18 or 19. - Okay, after he knocked you down... - Then the guy pulls this needle out from his pocket and sticks both of us and just runs away down the street. What's the matter? Why are you looking at each other like that? - Listen, we don't have time to explain. Give me a call at the office tomorrow. My number's on here. I should be in around 11 a.m. - What was he wearing? - Uh, I think he had on a denim jacket. He was wearing jeans and sneakers. - I have a feeling he's not driving though. I think he's using public transportation. One thing we do know is he's going west and he's got about 15 minutes on us. - Maybe he lives in the area. He's just taking an evening stroll. - Yeah, right, "I think I'll take an evening stroll with a needle in my hand." I don't see it. What'd that girl say he was wearing? - Jeans, sneakers, and a jean jacket. - Well, well, he should be real easy to find. There's only one or two thousand people in L.A. dressed like that. - Well, well, looky what we have here. - Oh my goodness. - Fits the description. - He sure does. - Let's see what he's up to on this fine California evening. - Okay, this is fine. - Police! Come here, we want to talk to you! Put your hands in the... Call for backup! All right, kid, freeze! Put your hands above your head and walk backwards towards me slowly, now! Do it! Drop whatever you have in your hand. Drop whatever you have in your hand. What the hell happened? I asked you for a backup. - I did! I called for backup. - Well, where the hell is everybody? Are they on strike? - No, wait, you have to tell me why you are handcuffed. - Key, please. - Hey, young man. I tell your fortune for you, eh? - No, I'm not interested. - Ah. Come, sit down. The cards tell all. - I don't have any money. Besides, nobody can tell the future. That's the stupidest thing I ever heard. - I do this for free, eh? Come, I lay out cards for you, eh? Ah. Tell me your name, young man. - It's Jeff. - You have last name? I want you to hold the cards in your hand, to give them your vibrations. Cut the cards, three times, with your left hand. Very good. I see many worries. Very troubled young man. I also see problems with your health. Are you sick? - Why do you wanna know? - It is my profession. I want to help. - You can't help. - No, please, wait. Sit down. There is more. Your behavior lately has been very confusing to others. And to yourself. You feel very helpless. Because of that, you want to strike out in anger at everyone around you. You will not be satisfied until you have gone to the source of that anger and have squeezed the life out of it. - Bullshit! You know, they should've burned all you hags in Salem! - Why you do this to me? I no hurt you! I try to help you! - Here we go. - Mommy, I love you! - Uh-huh, I love you too, sweetie. How's Mommy's favorite little cowboy doing? - Good. Are you gonna be home for dinner with Daddy and me? - Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie. Mommy's gotta work late again. But on my first day off, I promise we'll go to Disneyland, okay? - But are you gonna go to find some bad guy and take him to jail tonight? - Yeah, that's Mommy's job. That's right. Here, take Mommy's keys. I'm gonna go talk to Daddy, okay, sweetie? - Nice of you to stop by to see how your old man and kid are doing. - Listen, Ray, I- - No, Stephanie, look. You listen to me. I don't know what type of an investigation you're on or anything, but your son and I, we need you here too. - Look, I know. I just I have no control over this case. I mean, the captain expects Sterns and I to spend extra hours on this one. It's out of my hands. Look, there's some guy running around and he's jabbing people with these needles that contain the AIDS virus, and we have to find this guy fast. I have to get him off the street. - Look, I'm sorry. I didn't realize it was that serious. - Yeah. - I guess it has to be priority one. - Well, I guess so. I just wish the captain would give me a little bit of free time so we could act like a family. Hi, sweetie. - Look, Mommy. I drawed a picture of a bad guy and the police. - Oh, honey, that's great. Where'd you learn to draw like that? - From school, of course. - Hey, honey, can you stay for dinner? Look, I got some chicken in the oven. - I can't. I gotta get back. - Aw. - Look, I love you guys more than anything in the world. I just... And I'm not gonna let this case ruin my family. If we don't wrap it up in a couple of weeks, then I'm gonna tell the captain that I want out, okay? - All right, honey. I love you. - I love you too. Bye, sweetie. - Bye, Mommy. - Surprise. - What are you doing in here? - I came to see you, Mr. Martin. You know, I needed that job and you fired me! - I fired you 'cause you're a little shit! Now get the fuck out of this office, right fucking now! Do you understand me? - Look, Mr. Martin. I got a little present for ya. - What's that? - This, my friend, is a hypodermic needle containing my blood, which is infected with AIDS! Come on, Mr. Martin! You fucking... - What happened here? - The best I can tell is the owner, Mr. Martin, was working late. Someone came in and picked up that telephone and repeatedly struck him in the head. - Well, was anything missing? His wallet or- - No, ma'am. Doesn't appear to be anything missing. This was sticking out of his stomach when we got here. - Pretty cute, huh? - Sounds like our guy. Anybody else here tonight? - When the paramedics arrived, my partner and I did a search of the building. It looks like the victim was the only one here at the time. - Yeah, if robbery wasn't the motive- - Maybe our killer had some kind of beef with Mr. Martin. - Could've been a former employee. - I think we'll pay Personnel a little visit in the morning. - Nursy, Nursy! What's the matter, you afraid of me? Huh? - Yes. - Where's the doctor? - I don't know. - Where is he? What's the matter? You afraid of dying? - Mm-hmm. - Huh? Let me tell you something, baby, if you're so afraid of dying. You know, I'm sure a lot of people are gonna miss you, huh? What a shame. Son of a bitch! Damn! Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! How you doin', babe? What's the matter? Let's go, Grandma. Fucking bitch! Hey, listen, Grandma. I need some money! - Get away! - I need a loan! What's the matter? Bank's not open today? Big mistake, Grandma. - Good evening, I'm Judith Campbell, and our top story at this hour is another needle attack, this time on an elderly lady, has taken place just moments ago in the Wilshire district. According to eyewitnesses, the attacker, asking for money from the woman, who was waiting for a City Center bus to take her Downtown, was unsuccessful. He then pulled out a needle and stuck her and fled on foot. The police, now on the scene, have set up a dragnet in the area, hoping to catch him. They are asking for public assistance. If you have any knowledge about the attack today- - Good luck, guys. - Or the two others last week, or any information concerning the identity of the attacker, please call the Rampart Division station at 485-4141 or Channel 9 News at 985-3565. This is Judith Campbell reporting for Channel 9 News. - Newsroom. Who should I say is calling? Hold on, I'll see if she's in. This guy says he's the needle attacker. He wants to talk to Judy. - It's probably a nut. I'll go see if she wants to talk with him. - I'll get the PD on the phone. Maybe they'll wanna run a trace on the line. - Sorry to disturb you, Judy, but there's some nut on line two who claims to be the needle jabber. Do you want to talk to him? - Absolutely. Thanks, Chuck. Hello, this is Judith Campbell. - Yeah, hi, I was just watching the news and I thought you might be interested in speaking to the person that was responsible for all those attacks. - What's your name? - Hell no! You ain't gonna get it, bitch! I'm calling you, big-time newswoman, to let you know that you're gonna get it. You're the next blabber, so you better look both ways before you cross the street. - Why are you doing this? - Fuck you. - Are you all right, Judy? - Yeah, I'm okay. - I've had Rampart detectives on line one. They were trying like hell to put a trace on the guy, but he wasn't on long enough. I'm sorry. - That's all right. Whoever our friend on the phone was, he was clever enough not to sit on the line very long. - Maybe you should call the police and get some protection. - Hell no, are you kidding? What I want is an interview with this guy. - What, are you crazy? This guy sounds dangerous! - Hey, being a journalist is dangerous. Sometimes you have to take a few chances. If this guy calls back, try to keep him on the line and beep me, okay? - Okay. - Hello, Judith Campbell? - Yes, who are you? - I'm Detective Smithers. Detective Rogers, my partner. May we come in? - What's this about? Am I under arrest? I know I don't have a lot of friends in the police department. Have a seat. - Of course not. Look, we understand that someone called you at work and threatened you. - Where did you hear that? - Well, that's not important. The important thing is that we feel that you need some police protection, and if this guy's as crazy as we think he is, we'd feel more comfortable if you'd consider having a policewoman come and stay with you for a few days. - Don't be foolish. I don't need any police protection. And secondly, this guy was probably just a crank caller anyway. And last but not least, I think I can take care of myself okay. - Look, I don't think you understand. You could be a target, and from the sound of things, you could be next on this guy's list. I mean, doesn't that scare you a little bit? - Don't be foolish. I have been in the most dangerous situations imaginable, and I don't scare easily. - Look, if this guy thinks that you've blown his cover and you're out to put him out of action, there's no telling what- - Are you trying to scare me? What's this really about? Why don't you two just tell me the truth? That you were sent here to harass me. I wasn't born yesterday. I think certain people in Metro PD are trying to intimidate me because I interfered in their hush-hush investigation into the AIDS jabber case. Aren't you really here to tell me to lay off? - You know, you're really something. You are. You just don't get it, do you? You're a high-profile person, so the department thought it would be a good idea to give you a little bit of help, but Ms. High and Mighty does not want our help. Let's get the hell outta here. It's a waste of time. You can just protect yourself. - Look. Here's my card. Call if you need to. - Listen, I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound ungrateful. It's just I've been working pretty hard lately. I guess what I'm trying to say is I do appreciate the concern by Metro, but I think I can handle myself on this one. - Hey, no problem. Can I ask you a few questions about the phone call? - Uh, sure, why not? Sit down. - Okay, what time of day did you receive the call? - A few minutes before I left work. - Did the caller identify himself? Did his voice sound familiar? - You mean like someone I've pissed off? Listen, I've made a lot of people unhappy. Sometimes my job requires me to dig a little deeper than what's being portrayed on the surface. - Did the caller say anything specific to you when he talked to you? - Mm, he said something about having seen me on a newscast and that now I was on the list. - The list? - I don't know, maybe the hit list. - Hey, I wouldn't take this so lightly. You could be in grave danger. - Come on, I've had crank calls before. This wasn't the the first. I'm sure it won't be the last. - We'd still feel better if you'd consider having a policewoman stay with you, just for a few days. - Thanks, but no thanks. I'll be all right. I don't want to be rude, but I'm meeting someone in a few minutes. - Okay. Well, you have our card. Call if you need to. Oh, do you have a gun? - Why? - Well, I would suggest that you carry it with you until we collar this guy. - Hello? Hello? Who's there? Who is this? Do I know you? Sounds to me like you're not playing with a full deck, buster. Better see a shrink when you have some time. - Yeah, Mr. Femine? - Yes. - I'm Detective Kaiser, LAPD. I called a few minutes ago. - Oh, I'm Pierre Femine. What can I do for you, Detective? - Well, Mr. Femine, I'm just doing a quick followup investigation into Mr. Martin's murder. I understand you do the hiring around here. - That's correct. - Okay, do you remember hiring an employee by the name of Jeff Roberts? - Jeff Roberts? - Oh yeah, I remember him. - Uh-huh. - A very troubled young man, he said. - Okay, yeah. - And what happened is that Roberts was late. - Okay, is this when he fired Roberts? - Not exactly. Mr. Martin went back to the warehouse and he saw Roberts there sitting, doing nothing, and he really got upset and he fired him. - Do you think that he killed Martin? - 1650 Gardina. - One-six-five-zero Gardina. - Apartment 8. - Coming! Yeah? - Jeff Roberts? - Yeah? What do you want? - We're metro PD. We need to come in and ask you a few questions, please? - Aren't you supposed to have some kind of a search warrant for that or something? - Only if we're searching the premises. Excuse me. - What do you guys want? Hey, look, I got a- - Hey, hey, hey! Sit down. - Just relax. - I understand you were fired from Martin Furniture last week. You want to tell us why? - Old Man Martin said I was irresponsible. Hey, don't tell me you guys came all the way over here just to ask me why I got fired. - No, Jeff, we didn't. Did you know that somebody killed Mr. Martin? - So what does that have to do with me? What, you guys don't think I had something to do with that old fart croaking, do you? - I don't know, did you? You had a doctor's appointment last week. You want to tell us what you saw the doctor for? - It's kind of personal, okay? - Didn't the doctor tell you you had AIDS? - Where's your bathroom? - Look, I'm not feeling too good, all right? You guys just wanna leave me alone? - Hey, hey, hey! Tell me where you were last Wednesday at 8:30, the night Martin was murdered. - You mind telling me what you're doing with this needle? - It's a long story, okay? Maybe some other time, all right? I gotta run. - Listen, man, we got all the time in the world and we're really good listeners, okay? - Oh, I'm sure you are. - This is his list. Look at the names. - Let me see that. - Here's his boss, Mr. Martin. - Christ! This must be a hit list. All the names are crossed off except for one. - Well, what's the name? - You're not gonna believe this. - What? - Judy Campbell. - How's L.A.'s finest big newswoman doing? - What do you want? Money? Here, take my wallet. - No, no, no. Don't you remember me? Huh? Huh? We talked on the phone a couple times. - What do you want? Please, just go. - I want you to know how it feels to have a death sentence staring you in the face. To have AIDS! - Why are you doing this to me? Maybe I can help you, if you want. I have a friend, a doctor. He's a specialist. If you want, maybe he can help you. No, no, no, no. No one's gonna help me, huh? I'm a dead man, lady. You understand that? Dead! D-E-A-D! - Don't give up hope. Maybe they'll find a cure. I was reading in the paper they're only a few months away from a vaccine for AIDS. - Listen, lady, I know you don't care about me, huh? You're just afraid of getting stuck with this needle, aren't you, huh? Why would someone as big and important as you be interested in someone like me with a problem? - Because I care. My uncle died of AIDS last year. I know the pain and torment he went through. I know what you're going through. Believe me, I know what you're going through. And I can help you, before it's too late. Let me help you, please. - How do I know you're not just giving me a line, huh? - You'll just have to trust me. - What's that? What is it? What's that for? - Jeff, this is very important. You have a responsibility to tell the world and the people out there what a dreadful and unfortunate disease AIDS is. To make them understand that you're a human being with feelings and emotions like everyone else. - Jesus, I hope we're wrong. If we're not, I hope to hell we're not too late. What kinda car did you say she had again? - It was a gray Cutlass Supreme. - Okay. - To make them understand. So before it's too late, tell the world that you deserve the respect and dignity that all human beings- - I gotta go. - Dave, it's right there. That's it right there. - Jeff, please! - No! - Police! Freeze! - I'll get the girl! I'll get the girl! Are you all right? Did he hurt you? - No, I'm fine. Please don't hurt him. - Just stay here! - He needs help! - Stay there! - Detective Smithers. Detective Smithers, come in. Detective Smithers. - Drop the needle, kid! It's over. Give it up, now! - You heard what he said! Put it down now! - Drop it! Hurry up! Drop the needle, now! Easy. - Slow. Do it! Slow. - Easy. Drop the needle. - Why'd you shoot him? Why? - He was coming at us with a needle, lady! What did you expect us to do, stand there and be his next victims? - He could have been helped! We were talking in the car before you came! - Grow up, lady. He could've stuck you with the needle. You could be in the morgue right now with a tag on your toe. You're lucky you're a smooth talker and were able to stall for time. There's a lot of people that weren't so lucky! - Smithers! Hold on a minute, hold on a minute. Hey, that was really good work back there. That creep should've been blown away over a month ago. - Well, all I know is I'm really pissed. - Hey, cheer up. You did the city a favor. It's one less wacko in the court system. It's one less Munchkin in the Land of Oz. Come on! Cheer up! Smile! - Yeah. All right. - Come on, let's go have a beer. Did I ever tell you about the time I saw this guy get hit by a truck? - No. - His name was Larry Parker. He was walking across the street. He was a little bit drunk. - This is Detective Smithers. I need a coroner at 5490 Sunset, rear parking lot, Channel 9. - 10-4. Detective Smithers, Captain Griswold has been trying to reach you on the police radio for some time. He left me this urgent message for Dispatch 113. - What is it? - The message reads: "Jeff Roberts does not have AIDS. Evidently the lab that ran the test had misfiled his papers. The results of his tests were negative. Repeat, negative." Detective Smithers? Detective Smithers? Please confirm last transmission. Detective Smithers?
