Candy? Shit. There goes my goddamn dinner. You couldn't pull that job off last night; how you gonna do this one in broad daylight? Last night they had a dog. Today I got you. What is wrong with you? I don't want to do this. There's a cop over there. - That ain't no cop! - How do you know? He don't piss like no cop. What are you worried about, man? Just keep your nerve, that's all you gotta do. Trust me, and you won't go wrong. Come on. Come on back. Come on, come on, come on. To your left a little bit. Come on back. I don't think I can do it. Man, don't tell me that stuff now, man. - Just hang in there. Don't lose your cool, okay? - Come on back. Come on. Ho! How's that? Don't worry about nothin'. I got the tape readouts. We got it made. Just put on the cap and the jacket. Come on, man, they're getting suspicious. Slide over here. Come on, hurry up! This guy's a real meatball, man. Hurry up, man. I'm talkin' about El Tubbo. You know what I mean? Okay, hurry up. What's the matter? Keep your cool. Hey, 20 bucks tip if you get me out of here in 30 minutes, all right? Hey! What's happenin', brother? Hey. I ain't your brother. Right. You ain't my brother. What is you, my mother? East, uh, Philly store. All right, come on. ...requested for next year's program. The spokesman went on to say that aspects of last year's program... are still under investigation. And on the subject of funding, we now go to our reporter Inez Pedroza in the field... where she has this rather shocking story about a children's home about to clos. The Claremont Children's Home on South Street... was closed today after 38 years of continuous operation... because of drastic budgetary cuts in the city's welfare department. Now, so far all of the children have been relocated, with the exception of eight in the home's special education unit. Watch how I handle this. Hey, blood, what's happenin'? My man! Outta sight. Good to see you, man. How's it goin', man? Lookin' good. Good. Hey, East Philly store, huh? Yep. Check it out. 75 Hitachis? Man, that's more than we did all last quarter. We're kickin' ass, man. I'll bet you are. Want me to run that through? Uh, no, I'll handle my main man right here. Thank you, I appreciate that. Everybody wants something Japanese nowadays, man. Cars, radios, they're even eatin' Japanese food. You know, raw fish, shit like that. Tastes worse than chitlins. Uh, this number doesn't compute. Doesn't compute? Try it now. - Now it's jammed. - Jammed? Damn. It's gonna take them a week to fix this. I mean, a black man can't stand a week off. You know what I mean? You gotta help me out. I don't wanna hold you up. Luke, give him whatever he needs. Whoo! You're all right, brother. I mean that. You got soul. Outta sight. All right, soul man. Here, have a cigar. Thanks, man. - Nice man. I'd like to introduce you to my sister. - Love to meet her. - You disco? - You kiddin'? Get down! All right. She'd love that. Later. What kind of problems are we talking about? The children in the special unit have very unique problems. There's blindness, lameness, pyromania, learning disabilities. One of them-- One of them was even forced into prostitution in Vietnam... at the age of nine. Fifteen minutes! Big tip! All right, come on. Get 'em on. Know your job! Know your job! You got to know your job! Marvin! What the hell are you doin', man? Let's get the hell outta here! Take it easy, man. Be cool. This is a score of a lifetime! We gonna get five, ten thousand apiece, baby! You mean five to ten in the pen. Let's go! Just take it easy. You know how to move and haul, right? Well, just get ready to move and haul our asses outta here. Here you go, my man. No hard feelings, right? Right. All right, let's move it! Load that big-screen TV! Now this bimbo wants the floor demo out there. So what's the problem? Give him whatever the East Philly store needs. Just mark it down. - At least check the registration to that truck out there. - Truck registration? Wait a minute! Do I have to take this kind of abuse, man, because I'm black? 'Cause I bet you don't torture the white people that come in here! Hey! I'll bet he don't torture the white people that come in here. Do you? No! We don't see television anymore! O-O-Okay, just calm down. We're having a sale down at the East Philly store-- a "Before The Riot" sale. Black people gettin' a chance to buy a television for the first time since the '60s, and this guy wanna mess it up! Well, I'm movin' this! If you wanna help me, you help me! Okay-- Get outta my way, man! I'm mad! See what you did, man? Now give me a hand with this. You've embarrassed me enough. Are you gonna fall for that? Marvin, no! What are you-- Shit! Jesus! M-- What? What-- What you gonna-- Wha-- Wha-- Huh? Wha-- What're you-- Huh? What? What it is! What it looks like! No, no, no, baby! What you gonna do? - I'm gonna knock you out! - Well, shoot your best shot, baby! Hey, if it isn't Miss TV Personality of 1981. Bad choice. Come on, let's go. I'm not going with you this evening; I'm staying with the children. Vivian, don't you think you're carrying this thing just a little too far? What are you gonna do with eight kids? Well, I am planning to take them to my aunt's farm... just outside of Seattle for starters; that'll give them a home. Do you really think you're going to get permission to take those kids out of state? Come on, Donald, nobody cares about those children. They won't even know they're gone. Besides, uh, I-- I already have permission. Why don't you give this up? I thought you would be willing to help me with these children. How am I gonna help you get eight children 3,000 miles across the country? Charter a jet? No. But you can get me a driver to drive that old bus we have in the back. Th-That wreck? Well, yeah. Vivian, get serious. Sweetheart. Oh, Donald. I've never been more serious in my life. I need your support more than ever before, darling. Please, you've got to help me. Mr. Braxton, in my 30 years on the bench, I have never seen a criminal record equal in intensity, length... and downright antisocial uselessness as your own. "The sale of counterfeit bus passes at the age of five; "conspiracy to impersonate a truant officer; Oh, that. Tha-- "a dishonorable discharge... "from the Army motor pool; "profiteering on Christmas Seals-- Can I see that? "Defrauding a chicken franchise"? Oh, I can explain that-- Braxton, you have already spent three years in a home for juvenile offenders, six years in state prison, and four years on probation under the guidance of that... gentleman over there. Now, before I pass sentence, do you have anything to say for yourself? Uh-- It's on, it's on! Your Honor, I'd like to make a confession. - I did it on purpose! I wanted to go back to prison. - You-- You what? I mean, doesn't it make sense? Anybody that'd hold up a store in broad daylight, stay 45 minutes, - must wanna go back to prison. - Braxton, you are talking about five to ten years. I know that, Your Honor, but I want you to give me 20 years! I gotta have 20 years! I can't go back on parole, not with that man! The man's a racist! He's an animal, Your Honor. I mean, he looks black, right, but he ain't black. He's as white as you are! No offense. I'm telling you, he treats black people like dog poo! Yeah! Four years I've been on parole in his hell! It's worse than being in the Ku Klux Klan, being under that man! Your Honor, you gotta help me! You can't allow me-- The prisoner will come to order! Please send me back to prison! Three meals a day! And let me sleep and rest and get my hair done! Let go of me! What do you mean, "let go"? Ten years probation! Case closed! No! Not probation! Oh, no! Get that man out of my courtroom! - I'll get you for this, you dirty rat! - Get him out of my courtroom! I'll get you for this! Please! Viva America! Get that man! God bless the Queen! Get him out! No-- Whew! Great show, Braxton. One hell of a performance. Well, you know, Yeah. Us actors must do what we do. Yeah. You can pull that stuff on Runzuli, but it don't go down too well with me. So, I will see to it that you do that five-to-ten... unless you do a little acting for me. What are you talkin' about? You understand? Yeah, yeah. What-- Okay, now, you listen carefully and I'll explain to you exactly the role you're going to play. Well, is it gonna make it? Oh, god! Well, Joe, how's it look? It's a piece of shit! Everything's rotted away, man; it ain't gonna make it out of the garage. Unless you know somebody from Mario Andretti's pit crew. We can get it to the junkyard. We have until Friday. Didn't you hear what I said? Yes, I heard, but everything has been arranged for Friday. I have money set aside in case you need anything, and I'll give you my business-- Something wrong, Mr. Braxton? No. I thought you said-- Hey! Uh-- Yeah. Uh, sweetheart, th-this man is an expert. Now, if he says it's not possible, it's just not possible. Donald, I thought you were going to get me someone to drive us to Washington. Look, sweetheart-- Don't tell me what's possible and what's not possible. Vivian, just-- Get your expert to fix the bus! Vivian, let me explain to you what's going on! I'm serious, Donald. Hey, look, I got a job interview to go to, I am serious, Donald! And I know this is personal-- Y'all look real nice together-- but I gotta split. - Hey, Braxton, you trying to make me look bad? - I ain't tryin' to do nothin'. I told you to tell her-- You told me to tell her the bus don't work! Donald! What's going on here? Ask your old man. You know something, Braxton? Uh-uh. I'm gonna burn your butt. You are? You're gonna burn that checkup on me, 'cause I ain't going back to the joint for you or nobody. I took care of that, man. You take care of your business. I'll see you Friday. Fix your hanky there. Miss Lady, nice meeting you. Braxton. Braxton! Donald! Let me just try to explain to you what's going on. Oh, never mind! Look, I'm trying my best to help you! This scheme is impossible! It's not gonna work! There's just no way! Hey, man, I wanna talk to you later. Hold it, Joe. You know darn well you don't have an appointment for today. Who needs an appointment? Goddamn! Whoo! I'm not going through that. Go through that one time with me. You disrupted the place last time; you're not going to put me through that today. Baby, you do it! Jump back! Oww! Mr. Kinsey. James Brown! Get down, boogie! Joe Braxton is here again. Well, send him right in, Miss Thomas. I've been expecting him. James Brown! Oww! Oww! Go on in now. Shit! Boy, if I had some gravy, I'd sop you! Goddamn! Hey, come on. You ain't mad, are ya, brother? Ain't no hard feelings on my part, you know. Did I get you good, or did I get you good? Whoa. You're funny, man. I never knew you had a sense of humor, you know that? Miss Thomas, would you get me the 35th Judicial Court. Judge Antonio... - Runzuli? - Donald, what the fuck you doin'? That man don't play. I didn't like that little game you played on me, and this is the payback, Joe. Hey, man, I was havin' fun with you. I thought you-- It was fun. Ha ha! You know, like, a joke! Hey, look, I'll tell you what. I mean, I'll, uh, wash your car and, you know, clean your house. I don't give a fuck-- pet your cat. But you can't ask me to fix a bus and go to Washington with a bunch of funky kids! Look, let's turn it around, Joe. Let's look at it from the other direction; now, what would you do in my position? If I was in your position, man, I'd give me a break! Give you a break. Yeah. Tell you what I'm gonna do-- As a matter of fact, I'll tell you what you're gonna do. - Okay. - You're gonna fix that bus, Yeah. You're going to take Miss Perry and those kids all the way to Washington, - and you're gonna be on your best behavior. You got that? - All the way. I got it, man. And if you screw this one up, it's your ass. Okay. I know-- I know what you want. I'm gonna take care of it. All right, children, here's our bus. Look at that! Yuck! If it makes it outta Philly, I'll faint. Where's the observation deck? I'm takin' my tape deck. What a crate! Remember our point system now. I want you to get 39's and 40's all the way to Washington. Yes, Miss Perry! This is Mr. Braxton, and I want you all to get in a line... and introduce yourselves as you board the bus, quietly. Samantha, I want you to be in charge for the moment. Lead them all on the bus for me, please. Excuse me. Is he the driver or the porter? Looks like the janitor to me. Definite schizoid personality with homosexual tendencies. Get on the bus. You didn't tell me you were gonna come see me off. I don't tell you everything. Miss Linda. I'm the lady on this trip, and I'm gonna be a great actress. Get on the bus! My daddy used to have a bus! I don't care what your daddy does! I don't wanna hear it! Get on the bus. We went all around the world. You shut up! Hey, brother! What the hell's the matter with you, man? He's blind, stupid! Help him on! Why don't you zip his pants up if he's blind? Get outta my seat! I can drive! Tell him, everybody! Harold loves to drive! He's always driving! I don't care! Drive your ass to the back of the bus. Do that! Hey! You leave Harold alone! He's our pal! How come you ain't takin' me fishing? What? Take you where? You promised to take me fishing! Before this trip is over, I'm gonna have to kick your ass! You couldn't kick your-- grandma's ass! I can kick yours right now! Get on the bus. On the bus, please. Get on the bus, and watch your language! Hey. Hell of a group, man. Here's your travel permit... and your return bus ticket back to Philly. Bus ticket? Thanks so much. Behave yourselves. Fifteen days, Braxton. You got that? Yes, sir. You got fifteen days to get back here. And Miss Perry is a lady. Anybody can see that, boss. You still got last year's dirt wrinkles on. Did your mother ever tell you to take a shower? Hi, sailor. My name's Annie. What's yours? My name's Joe. Excuse me. Up the stairs. Let's get in. Come on. All right, children-- Fifteen days. You're all heart, Chief. Hey, mama, grab hold of this. Make yourself useful. There'll be no smoking on this bus, Mr. Braxton. Hey, no, no. No good. Wait a minute. You don't throw out my cigars. I don't feel like smokin' right now. Take care of yourself, homes. You all right. Bus. Fifteen days. Miss Perry? Yes. What? Oh, Donald. Thank you. Get off of me! Make me. Get off! Martin! Martin! Stop that, please! Go sit in the back. Ernesto, move over there. Quickly! Now, listen, children, this is going to be an extremely difficult trip for all of us, and it is not an excuse to get out of doing your schoolwork. Get your workbooks out, please. Miss Perry, mine fell out the window. So did mine, Miss Perry. Hey, let me drive. Get your hand off the wheel before I tell Miss Perry! I can drive! You can't do nothin'! This is a hijack! What? Hijack, bro. I don't give a damn what it is. Hijack off! I can drive! I'm serious! Back of the bus! Where you keep your money, chump? Yeah! I keep my m-- Damn, you thief. Convict. Yeah? You the bad one in the group, huh? Yeah, that's right. I can kick ass when I have to, and I can see now you and me is gonna get it on yet! Mm-hmm. I can kick ass too. You know what I was in prison for? What? Murder. Get your ass to the back, You're crazy! Or I'll stick you in your ass! Stole my wallet. Martin, you'll share a room with Ernesto and Tony. Annie-- I wanna room with Joe. Annie, you and the girls will room with me. All right, uh, Harold and, uh, Julio-- I ain't staying in a room with Julio; he always makes me bump into furniture! If you could see, you wouldn't bump into any furniture! I can see! I just can't see furniture! I don't wanna sleep with Linda, 'cause she snores and keeps me and Dakota awake! At least I don't talk in my sleep! Hey! Uh, I'd like-- Ho! My key, please, Miss Perry! I'd like to go to my room. I'd like to-- You know what I mean? That's enough. I want you all to go to the bus and get your things. And I want you all to behave like young adults. You behave any differently, I'll be very disappointed in you. Uh, Miss Perry, what time are we leaving in the morning? Can I have the key to my room, please? There are no more rooms available in the motel, Mr. Braxton. You'll have to sleep in the back of the bus. Wait a minute. You gotta be joking. I'm sure you'll be quite comfortable. But there's no shower; there's no bed; there's no TV on the bus. Mr. Braxton, I think it would be marvelous if you read a book for a change. "Marvelous," my ass. I ain't sleeping on no goddamn bus! - What did you say? - I am not sleepin' on no goddamn-- bus. I'm not sleepin' on no bus! I am not sleepin' on no bus! Mr. Braxton! Mr. Braxton, wake up! Mr. Braxton! Mr. Braxton! Holy-- Mr. Braxton, why are you sleeping on the floor? I put it over the pillow... Isn't the back seat big enough? And I couldn't-- Listen, never mind. Listen, we're in trouble. Maybe the rest of them will run away! No, you don't understand. I need you to get up and come look for them for me. I ain't no truant officer! I ain't goin' chasin' no damn kids! I drive the bus! What did you say? I said, I am no truant officer, I drive the bus! You wouldn't do a damn thing to help those children, would you? You're swearing! Never mind! Nobody! Nobody but your little old, pathetic, selfish self! My little old, pathetic, selfish self deserves three hours sleep tonight, and, damn it, I'm gonna get it! All right, I'll go look for them. Good idea. But may I impose on you... to just keep an eye on those children in number five while I look for these boys? No, no, no, no. I'm no baby-sitter. I drive the bus. Would you like me to call Mr. Kinsey, Mr. Braxton? What room are they in? Number five! Number five. Right. Number five! Number five. Number five. Mr. Braxton. Yes, ma'am. Number five. Now. Number five. Number five. Ohh! Linda's got the bathroom locked, and Dakota has to go pee! Yeah. Right. Take her to the bathroom in the woods! Bears pee in the woods. I ain't goin' in the woods!

You tryin' to kill yourself? Get back! Pull that out! You guys want something to do? Okay, I got something for you to do. Wow! Where'd you learn to do that? Huh? Now we gonna play a grownup game. - Can I light it? - No, you cannot light it. We're gonna play strip poker. I'm not. What? Hey, that's my favorite. - Mine too. - We get to keep the clothes, right? Oh, yes. Winners keepers, losers weepers. All right! - This is serious business. We gonna get down, jack! - Uh-oh. Straight. Straight! To the left. To the left! Now spin it to the right!

Children, gimme-- - Mr. Braxton! - Aah! What do you think you're doing? Where are the children? What's going on here? They were-- There they are. Why are they in the closet? We just-- - And why are you half-dressed in here? - It's, uh... Halloween? Let's have some french fries. French fries? I love them! I know! They're greasy, just like meatballs! Donald. No-- No. I am not coming back, Donald. I don't care if you call out the SWAT team-- Operator, yes, just a moment, please. Just a moment. Fifty-- There. Yes, hello? Hello, Donald?

Miss-- Miss Perry. - Go away, please. - The kid's havin' a barbecue. Miss Perry! Miss Perry! Uh-- Ohh! Anthony, what the hell's wrong? What are you, damn crazy? - Jesus Christ! Je-- - No! No! Get away from here! Get away! - Don't hurt him! Anthony! - No! No! No! Help! - Oh! Anthony! - No! - Stop it! Stop it! - No! Don't anybody move. - What the hell's goin' on? - It's only a child that's a little disturbed. It's only a child. He's a little disturbed. Anthony! It's all right. It's all right! It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. Calm down. Who's gonna pay for this? Please calm down. Everything's fine. Miss Perry! Here's $20. That'll cover any damage. That's about a dollar's worth of hay. Please gimme a break, will ya? She's burning! No, no, Anthony. Listen. She's burning! You mustn't think that-- She's all right. She's burning. She's all right. Please believe me. She was on fire. No, she wasn't. She wasn't. She-- Um, I, uh, I paid this guy. I don't know what's happenin'. I didn't mean to-- I didn't hurt him. I just threw him back, ma'am. I'm sorry.

What? Stop the bus. Dakota has to go to the bathroom. Dakota don't need to go to no bathroom. Don't you like her? I don't like Dakota or her mama. She likes you. She does? Stop the bus! I don't wanna stop the bus! I want you to stop the bus! Shut up! Oh, gee, why don't you stop the bus! Stop the bus! Damn! There's two bathrooms. You're gonna stand in line? Why don't you use the other bathroom? Somethin' wrong with you? Miss Perry, what's the farm gonna be like? Well, I haven't been there in a long time, Annie, but I'll tell you, I spent the best days of my life there. Is there fish in the lakes? Well, there were a lot of fish then. I don't know if there are anymore, but my dad and I used to go fishing all the time, and I didn't catch one fish; he caught all the fish. I never been fishing in my life; Joe's gonna take me. Can Dakota climb trees? Can Dakota climb trees. Come on. Samantha, did you ever climb a tree? No. You never climbed a tree? I used to climb a tree a lot. I was a little tomboy. - I fell out once. Look what happened to me. Ohh, boy. - Ooooh! I cried like a baby. I'll tell you one thing, my mother surprised me. Instead of a beating, she gave me a big hug and a kiss... and a huge slice of blackberry pie. That took care of the crying. Do I cry. It was a dark and stormy night. Two men were sitting in a graveyard. - One wanted to-- - No! No! Giants! Two giants were walking-- Ho, ho, ho! Shit! Damn kids! Let's do it again! It was a dark and stormy night. Two men were sitting in a graveyard. One wanted to tell a story, and this is the story he told. Hold it! Listen to me. I'm gonna take that whistle and stick it up your ass... if you don't shut up when I turn around! I mean it! I'm finished! I gotta drive this bus! Now, shut up! We're stuck! Stop it! Calm down! We're stuck and we're in trouble. We have to try to help Mr. Braxton. What can I do? I'm going to, um, go out... and, um, I want you to sit here, and when I say "Kick it over," you turn it on... and put it in gear, and I'm gonna try to put something under the tire... and we'll get it to movin'. Okay? All right. And we'll be out of here in no time. No problem. Move your foot out of the way. Get 'em out of the way! Children, let's try to keep ourselves together. I'm not playin'! Shut up! Jesus! Look at Joe! Look at that! I'm gonna kill 'em. Hey! Stop! He looks like Godzilla! The Creature from the Black Lagoon! I'm sorry, Mr.-- Ahh. It's okay. I'm awfully sorry. I tried to-- to get the-- the bus going. What did you-- Just-- Well, here. I mean, I really-- No, listen to me. Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho. Is it out of gear? Is the bus outta-- Yes, I think it is. Uh, I saw a farm back there. You're a mess! I'm sorry-- Can I ask you a question? Just try to clean yourself up a bit, will you? Oh, I certainly will. If I see a toilet, I could use it. Here. No, no, no, no. Oh, more. Thank you. Uh, don't shift nothing. Don't do anything. Just leave it like it is, because it's straight now, Yes, I will. Yes. And we... wanna keep it... that way. Okay? Right. Right. Please hurry back, Mr. Braxton. Get back, children. Get back inside. Joe Braxton's my name, and woodsman's my game. Fuck with me. The bitch send me to get a motherfuckin' piece of push! Well, I don't take no shit from nobody! I'm Mrs. Braxton's favorite son! Joe, baby! Joe-Motherfuckin'-Braxton. Try me one time, you understand. Get me workin' on the motherf-- Bitch gonna have to be saved. Shit. "And so Sir Gawaine and the Green Knight... "crossed the mountains at night, torches lighting their way, "paying no heed to Lancelot's warning... "that the forests were filled with frightening white ghosts." Miss Perry! - What's that? - Fire. - Who are they? - Miss Perry, take it easy. It's all right. Everything's all right! Take it easy! Please be-- Fire! Well, you weren't lying, were you, boy? You got a bunch of kids here. - What are we gonna do with you, boy? - Is that you, Joe? - What are you doing? - He's blind! He's blind! All the kids are blind! All of them! I'm taking them to the hospital. I'm just tryin' to take them to the hospital. They need an operation. Look, can I talk to you? They're very sensitive. Listen, they're all blind. You're kiddin'. No, all of them. All of them. Oh, that's terrible. Except for her. We're going to the Ray Charles Institute for the Blind; they're gonna have miracle operations. You saw it on Oral Roberts. They probably ran it here. It was on TV. Get up behind the wheel. We'll help push you out. You're a wonderful human being. Ohh. And a great American. You guys, get behind the bus! Let's go, boys! Come on, let's go! Boys, come on, let's get these people out of here. All right, hit it up there! There's children in that bus, boys! Let's go! Heave! Heave! Heave! Shee-it!

Hey! - All right! - You can't do that; we don't have fishing equipment. You're looking at a man who can catch a whale with a toothpick. You kiddin' me? We're goin' fishin'. Ooh!

Well, you might. Hey, you wanna watch the game or somethin'? I really can't, Joe. I've gotta get this paper-- Donald! What are you doing here? I'll be damned. Oh, that's good. That's real good. What are you doin' here? What the hell's goin' on, Braxton? It ain't what you think it is, man.

Please, get dressed quickly. The children are already on the bus. We're leaving now. Please hurry. Put your clothes on quickly! Okay. Yes, ma'am. Miss Perry? Where are my clothes now? Miss Perry?

It's all right. Donald, please. I'll handle him. It's all right. He told us he's gonna take us. Harold, we'll work out something. He told us! I know he's gonna take us back! Listen, Harold. Listen to me! It'll be all right. We'll work out something. No, it won't! We'll work out something. Please, calm down. He always-- Why do we gotta go back to Philadelphia? 'Cause we don't wanna go back. They'll send us to Coolidge! All the teachers there are mean. No one likes us! We don't want to go back! We don't want to. Please, sir, don't let them take me back to that place. All right, children, get on the bus. No, Vivian. No! Don't make me do this. No, Braxton. Braxton, you get the hell out here! Damn it! Where your wallet at, man? Wait a minute. Look, look, look. Listen to this. I took your wallet, and I put it in Donald's pocket. Now I've got his wallet, and I'm giving it to you, man. Jesus Christ!

I know you didn't mean to do that, Anthony. It wasn't my fault. I was standin'... near the curtains... and I was playin' with the match... and... they caught... and... I tried to wake up my parents, but... they wouldn't wake up. And then the fire started spreading... and I just couldn't-- Oh, Joe! I didn't mean it. I know you didn't mean it. It was an accident. You understand? An accident. Nobody means to do stuff like that. But you gotta throw it away now, leave it in the past. It's gone. Your parents would want that, Anthony. You gotta try now. You gotta leave that stuff alone. I love ya, Anthony. I love you. Hi. Hey. You've been walking. Man, I was down there by the creek. I went over there. I was over there fishin' with Julio, right? Yeah? And then I went down this way. There was a creek down there. Mmm. That's for you. Thank you. You're welcome. Big old trout in there like that! What'd you do with it? I didn't do nothin'. I didn't have my pole then. We was over there fishin' in a river that had salmon, but they wouldn't bite now because they're spawnin'. Yeah. Lotta memories in this place for me. It's a beautiful place. Yeah. See that tree there? Yeah. I fell outta that tree. Remember I talked about this scar I had? What you doin' in an ugly tree like that? My cat! My cat! It got stuck up in the tree. I went up to get-- That is a rock egg. And that's for you. It's magic. It's laid by the rock bird. You mean I can rub on it and make three wishes? You can make as many wishes as you wish. What is Miss Perry doing? She's robbin' the bank. I'm gonna drive the getaway car. Perhaps your bank in Philadelphia could be more helpful, Miss Perry. Good day, Mr. Schuyler. And thank you for nothing! I-- Hey, look at that car! Yeah! What kind is it? I don't know, but it's bad! Honey, you forgot your lunch. Oh! Thank you, dear. All right. What's wrong with Miss Perry? I don't know. Get in. Vivian? What's wrong? What's the matter? I have a problem that I want to work out, and I need to do it by myself. You can't work problems out by yourself. Maybe I could help. I want to help you! Just tell me the problem. If I can't help you, I'll say, "I can't help you." But what's the matter? I didn't get the money. What money? I didn't get the money. I'm gonna lose the land, the house. I'm-- This is your house. What are you talkin' 'bout? I needed $15,000 to pay the taxes, the mortgages. They're gonna sell the place! I don't qualify. I don't have a job. I cannot get the money. Everything I... dreamed is... gone. What do you mean, gone? I lost the dream, Joe. What you talkin' 'bout, you lost? What are we, losers? I ain't no goddamn loser! Well, do you have it? Can you give it to me? Do you have $15,000? No, I don't have it! If I had it, you'd have it! I don't have shit, but me! But I ain't no loser, and don't you tell me I am! And they ain't losers either! I did something once in my life! I'm somebody, and you ain't gonna take that away from me! Hey, guys, come over here. I gotta tell you something. Miss Perry couldn't pay the bank, and we're going back to Philly! Aw, man! Aw, it's not even fair! We don't wanna go back! Shut up! Go take a hike! Shut up! Up. You guys are somebody, man. And you stop this shit! The woman put her ass on the line for you! And you don't think nothin' but yourselves! Hey. What? We're not losers. We're not losers. She tried. "Dare to be rich." "The Trapezoid Approach... To Personal Economic Security." This sounds very familiar. I know this. In what way does your trapezoid differ from the pyramid schemes... that we've been reading about in the papers? I'm glad you've asked that. I'll bet you are. Now, the pyramid is based on the triangle, which has three sides. But the trapezoid has four sides! And it is that fourth side which guarantees, geometrically and mathematically, the enrichment... of all those who participate in it. Does that answer your question, sir? Yeah, thank you. Now... are there any other questions? I have a gentleman in the back row. Uh, Mr. Professor Renfrew? Sir. My name is Millard Gregg, and I'm from Texarkana. I have a few questions about that tra-- tripi-- trapezoid? Now, you say if I give you a thousand dollars, by this afternoon my money will double? Maybe even triple? Triple? Oh, my god, sir. Why, some people-- Mr. Munjak here-- have seen their bank accounts grow twentyfold... in under a week through the trapezoidal method! Twentyfold? Yes, let's hear it for the gentleman! And he don't pay no taxes? - That is right! - Hot damn! I don't wanna miss this! Now, I'm gonna give you my thousand dollars... 'cause you're at the top of the trapezoid. That's right. And then I'll sell my share to two other people, and they give you half, and give me half. That's right. And then this thing doubles and then splits. And then you get money from that side and that side and that side. That's right! My god, my wife and I this morning said a prayer... to God. I really can't. I mean, this is on the up and up? That's right. Then you won't mind if I collect the money? I'm one of these people. You people don't mind, do you? Uh, Dwayne, would you let the gentleman take your chair... momentarily? Well, thank you, Dwayne. Don't mention it, brother. You know, my god, look at this! Thousand-dollar bills! You know, you can live a lifetime and never see a thousand-dollar bill. I haven't seen one of them since-- Well, hell. Mmm, my, my. Look at that. Ain't that nice! This is gonna be real fun here. I can tell we gonna have a real good time, all the way, me and you, huh? You wanna get started? Samantha, pass me a piece of corn. Ernesto, you want this? Come on, pass me the corn bread. Can I have some greens? Pass me some greens. Aunt Beedee, I'd like to borrow the truck for a little bit. I want to run into town and see if I can find out what's goin' on. Thank you. Thank you. Dare to be rich, sir. - Dare to be rich, sir. - Everybody's doin' what they gotta do. Yes, sir. Yes! Dare to be rich! Now, who next will dare to be-- The gentleman in the cowboy hat! Yes, you, sir. Uh, Mr. Munjak! Thank you. Thank you, sir. Yes, indeed. Everybody dare to be rich. Assist our new associate. Dare to be rich. - You bet. - Everybody's supposed to dare to be rich one time in life. You get two people, and they get two people... and you split up like that and just dare to be rich! Having fun, turkey? Oh, yeah. I am, I am. Dare to be rich! You better dare to haul ass when we get you outside. And now, who's next? Who will dare to be rich? Martin, isn't that the car we saw at the bank? What car? The Rolls Royce. Yeah, let's trash it! No, let's steal it. Wait! I've got a better idea. What? As you know, we will not be returning to this area... for at least three weeks. So, ladies and gentlemen, while Miss Beasley... pins these two remaining names, I would ask those of you who have not yet joined us... in the trapezoid, to consider seriously the thought of coming along with us. That's right, 'cause he'd never lie to you! 'Cause easy come, easy go. 'Round and 'round she goes. Joe! Where she stops, nobody knows. I'm telling you, Miss Johnson, you did a wonderful thing! She's in the trapezoid! Let's hear it for Miss Johnson! Yes, sir. Why don't you take care of that, Dwayne? And look it here! Here's another lady who wants to join the trapezoid! What are you doing? There she is, ladies and gentlemen! You got a thousand dollars? How many shares you want? What? Now, don't ask me. I sold the bus and bought this outfit, and I'm trying to make us money. Yes, ma'am, $300! You sold the bus? Here's $15,000 for the kids. Take it home! Don't worry about a thing. Next time we come to town, we gonna jam. You sold the bus? Everybody wants to be in the trapezoid! Yes, I sold the bus. You remember high finance! You gonna die poor! Dwayne, would you go, please? I wanna ask you-- Did you say someth-- Don't ask me nothin'. The lady thinks the pentagon's better than a trapezoid. Oh, my god! Ladies and gentlemen, just keep calm! You sold the bus? Yes! Everybody keep calm! My associates had a slight altercation, but, uh-- Now, wait. Don't crowd! What are we runnin' for? They got guns! Halt! I warn you, sir, I'm trained in kung fu! What have you done? All right, wise guy. Where's the money? I don't have the money. All right-- You check that out. I'll guard the door. I'll fix this young lady's wagon! Wait a minute! Are you gonna hit me with a plunger? Are you crazy? Sheesh. Just put it down! You think you're bad, don't you? You're messin' with Joe Braxton, baby! Joe B-- Oh, shit. Kill him. Money! Leave him alone! You want the money? I got the money! Come and get it! Get the money! Come and get the money! Frank, we need water! Get up, please! Let's go! Tell Samantha Dakota can go pee now. Come on! Let's get outta here! They're gonna kill us! Come on! Where's the money? Never mind that. Let's just get outta here! Wait a minute! You burned the money? They're gonna kill you! Just get the truck! Meet me out front! Yeah! You stinking bastards! Jump in! Hurry up! They're catching us! They're catching us! Jump in! Slow down! Jump in! I gotta turn the corner! Don't turn! I have to turn! Jump in! No! Come on, th-they're coming! Get up! Get up. They're coming. Joe! Get up! Hurry up, get in! Are you okay? I'm fine. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Thanks for what? Thanks for what? Thanks for the help. It was real nice of you to throw the money away. Well, you're welcome. You're welcome, Mr. Braxton. You're a fuck-up! I have asked you not to use that kind of language to me! Bullshit! Did you want me to sit there and watch you get killed? That's real nice. Fifteen thousand dollars! He had a gun! He would have killed you for $15,000! Killed shit! That ain't nothin' but a meatball! Do you think I could sit there and let 'em blow your life away for nothing? It ain't for nothing! I'm tryin' to help! It is worth more! Your life, Joe, is worth more to me than $15,000, you fool! Here. The money. Here, take what's left of it! Here! Take it! Take it! There it is! I don't want it! Vivian-- You can have it! Here, take it! Listen, Vivian. Leave me alone! Vivian, I don't want the money. I don't want the money. I don't want the money. I didn't do it for me. Goddamn, I didn't-- Vivian. Joe. Vivian. Ain't nobody ever told me I was worth no $15,000. My daddy used to say, "Boy, you ain't worth a quarter for two of ya." You say that to me... you set me on fire. Shit. What the hell is that? Where'd you get it from? I don't know. It's not mine. Well, then, whose, whose car-- Good-bye, children. Good-bye, Linda. I hope you feel better. Good-bye. You must be Miss Perry and Mr. Braxton. Uh, what's wrong? What are you doing here? I'm Gladys Schuyler, and this is my husband Alfred, whom I believe you met. Yes, but... what's going on? Well, these children have told us about all the wonderful things... that you did for them. Hitchhiking 300 miles in a snowstorm when your bus broke down. And sitting up all night for a week with little Linda when she had the fever. Helping Harold learn Italian in Braille. Molto grazie. You people are terrific. You know, these are really wonderful children, and they deserve every chance they can get. All right, Braxton, this is it. Officer, this man is in violation of his parole. I'm his parole officer. I'm taking him, this woman and these brats back to Philadelphia. - What's going on here? - You heard me. I'm taking these people back to Philadelphia. Do you have a warrant for my arrest? Well? No. - I'm not going back. - She's staying. Who the hell are you? That's Mr. Schuyler, our town mayor. All right, now, look, this woman has violated at least 20 federal statutes. Kidnapping. You want a legal battle? All right, I'm gonna get on the phone. I'm gonna get a warrant for his arrest... and her arrest-- Hold on a minute, friend. Before you get off the phone, all these children will be registered in the state. And I'm having the farm transferred back to Miss Perry in her name... with a big enough loan so she can operate it properly. But this man is still under my jurisdiction. Donald... take it easy, man. I'll go back with you. I gotta go back. I did something. Don't worry. Please don't go, we need you! We have a reason for you to stay. "Dear Mr. Braxton, we, the children of this house, "pardon you for the crimes you have done... "because we know... "you is sorry... you did them." You have to read it. "We wish that when we grow up we're fine people just like you. "From this day on, you are off parole... and nobody can stop you no more." This is real special. I just-- I did something wrong, you know, and I made a deal with the government... Don't go back. Shh, don't cry. All right, Braxton, let's go. I'll give you a minute to say good-bye. Hey, stop it. Don't try to drive no buses. Yeah. Hey, big momma, come here. Come here. Hey, man, you're gonna make me cry. No more swearing. I love you. Thanks. I ain't no loser. I'm a tough Puerto Rican. You better believe it, man. Get out. Go on back home.
