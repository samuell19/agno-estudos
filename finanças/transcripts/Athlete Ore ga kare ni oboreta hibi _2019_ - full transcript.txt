Good, everyone. Take five. Kaido, do you have a sec? What now? Com'on. They're just kids. But, we have some future Olympic-caliber swimmers here... Open your eyes. Your injury killed a chance to win a medal, but that's all history. Don't place your dream onto them. This is the last warning. Got it? ATHLETE I'm home. Welcome back. What happened? As I have more students now, I've decided to move my classroom into a new place. You're doing well. I want a divorce. Why so suddenly? Not suddenly. A man? He's a part of it, but that's not all. Yukiko. I'm home. You've made up your mind, finally. Mizuna, you knew it? What? I'm not that dumb. I have an appointment, bye. Damn it. Are you alright? Welcome. Morning. Talk to you later. Morning. What's this place? Paradise. The nearest place to heaven. - Gay's...? - Hey. Call LGBTQ, at least. Please sit. Male or female, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning. Labeling means nothing. This is where you can be you. Please keep me company for a while. I'm dumped again. Hey. Don't scare him off. Don't worry. I won't bite him. I'm Mimosa. Good to meet you. Awful. What a boring guy. This is the lady of the house, Priscilla. Would you care for a drink? Some liquor, please. What's Yuta to you? Just a friend, aren't you? Com'on. Lighten up. Here you are. Zubrowka & tonic. Liquor of First Love. Zubrowka & cranberry juice to me. This is liquor of Lost Love. You tow look good together. I know, right? I'm not... Anyhow, here's to our meeting. Oh my... You're cool. You drink like a man. Cool. Don't drink too much. Oh my goodness. Are you alright? Morning. Scrambled or fried eggs? Don't remember? Where am I? My room. I'm Yutaka. Call me Yuta. This... is my roommate, Rusty. Raping isn't my taste. Sorry. And? Sunny-side up. Shower is over there. Can I have one? Well, I'm off to work. Here's a key. If nowhere else to go. Thank you. See ya. I knew it. My gratitude. I have a strong sense of duty. I read your mind. Great. - Let's eat. - I'll help you. Looks delicious. That woman... she waited until our daughter is about to graduate. Didn't you expect it? It's over. I kind of got married on a whim anyway. So, why did you? I was lonely. My parents died early and I had only my brother. I devoted myself to swim, but I was all alone. So I longed for... a marriage and a family. But, you only wanted to ease the pain of loneliness. Our daughter was the only bond. I hid... my feeling very hard... to save my family, but it fell apart. Everything is gone. I'm Yutaka. I'm studying to be an animator. I want to study in France one day, and Annecy Film Festival is my dream. What's wrong? What bothers you? I've dated two women, but I might like men more. I see. I can't choose which, yet. I guess you don't have to. Can you put it on hold? Won't be long. OK. Sorry. Your friend? A part-time job, "Chat Boy", until my regular job. Never heard of it. Everybody is lonely and wants to connect with someone. You going? Yes. My turn to make dinner? I can come home early. See ya. Dad, what are you gonna do? I don't know, yet. I just want more time to think. Be a man, dad. Sorry. Excuse me, where is Yasunori Imaizumi's room? Could you wait a second? I'm back. Completely drunk? Hey, what's your name, fish? Swimmy. I named it. Swimmy? Leo Lioni's masterpiece! I really like the book. I will make one like it. I read it when I was a child. Are you alright? Swimmy was the only tiny fish born with a black body. Later, he led a school of fish using his black body. In the book, Leoni put his message, "everyone has its character and role in this world." He put it in there... My father is in a coma. You should go now. I did. But I couldn't see him. I left home to be an animator 10 years ago. I just couldn't tell him that... I'm gay. I wanted to say it face to face when I become a pro. But... You've been working very hard. I haven't reached the start line, yet. I have nothing to show. Still... I'm scared... of seeing his face when I tell him I'm gay. What would I do if he says that I'm creepy? I think about those things. It scares me. I just can't... I go to Annecy. A lagoon city and holy ground of animation. Shall we? Promise. Are you OK? Drinking? Yes. Quite a lot. - Quite a lot? - I still have memory. You always lose it. Here you are. You're settled in, aren't you? What? I mean you seem to find yourself. I guess I've only seen the half of this world in my life. You got that right. Nothing like "this should be this" or "that has to be that." I think so too... because I feel livelier than before. That's natural. Being natural is good. You suck. Hey. - Hey. Wanna leave? - No, I'll drink with you. Another one, please. Hey, why don't you join us? Well, OK. - What are you drinking? - Same as usual. The same one, please. About the rent, let me pay my half. Are you sure? I've decided to live with you. Take a break. Well, it was pretty delicious, but that's all. You seemed to enjoy it. The rating was 3.8 of 5 on the Net. We're home. This is too big, isn't it? Some flour on your face. - Here. - Really? Why on your face? No, stop. I heard this fish is too territorial to live in the same tank. If in the same tank? They fight until one of them is completely wasted. This is beautiful? Yes. It's wearing a burning red dress. I see. Red. I'm partial color blind. It's difficult for me to detect red. Red? What color do you see is sunset? How about blood? If you ask me, I'll say, red. But is it different from what I see? Maybe, it is. I wonder what the world you see is like. What's wrong? You don't wanna do now? What are you doing? What's going on? Tarot? I am wondering... About Yutaka? He sometimes seems lonely even if we are together. We all are alone, aren't we? But... I saw that guy. The boy who was a male prostitute. Yuta... Yutaka. He had nice ass. He was very sensitive. What? His boyfriend? Is that it? That means we are all brothers, right? What do you want? Shut your mouth, bustard. You are too coward to do anything on your own. What? You whore. Be quiet. I'm hungover. Get out, or call the police. Don't beg us to come back. Well done. No match for Priscilla. Yuta. You thought... that I'm filthy? Of course not. By the way, the other day... A liar. No, I'm not. Whatever... Are you going out? Yes, sorry. We're supposed to go fishing. Sorry, l promise to see my daughter. I get it. OK. Enjoy. Very sorry. I'll make it up to you. Long time no see. Atsushi, where've you been? What? You sound depressed. Yeah, a little. I see. It sounds really rough to be rejected so clearly. Well, I kind of knew that he and I live in different worlds. Kohei has a family. You have a family too, don't you? Yes, but we live apart. Also, they don't know who I really am. It could be true that there is a wall between us. Because he's straight? Com'on. "Sex doesn't matter. We are all human beings." That is your theory, isn't it? What do you say to catch up tonight? How about the usual place? Take care. That movie was really good, wasn't it. How's it going? Is that him? Let me introduce you. I'm Atsushi. I heard a lot about you. He runs a film company. It?s a small one for indie films. Good to meet you. Want to join us? No, not today. You must excuse me. What? Now? See you soon. See ya. Enjoy. Croatia? No, I haven't seen it. I really like that kind of movie. I wanna see it. You have tickets for previewing? Thanks, Atsushi. When do I think is the best? Mmm... let me see... - Did you see the TV program? - Yes, it was interesting. Good afternoon. - I heard that he is gay. - Creepy. Go to hell. You drink too much. I just make the most of my life. Whatever you say. Animals instinctively try to exclude different ones. Discrimination and prejudice will never go away. But you're gonna lose if you get desperate. You're right. You're the only one who understands me, Atsushi. An all-nighter? Sorry, did I wake you up? With who? Can't you say who? None of your business. You were with him? Yes. Did you sleep with him? - I did. - How come? An interrogation? Because I love him. Not only with him but... Stop. What's so funny? Atsushi was great. He knows everything of me. He knows how to make me come. That's what it is. What? You toyed a straight man like me, huh? You must've had fun. You whore. Is that your answer? You suck. You don't understand me at all. Hello? How are you? This is Atsushi, Yutaka's... Ah, yes. Is he at home? I can't reach him. Why do I know where he is? What? Weren't you with him? No, I took the last flight to Hong Kong. Could you let him know that a director is interested in his works? Are you there? Yes. I will. I'll give you some advice. You'd better leave him. You two will never understand each other. That's all for today. Thank you. See you. Makoto? What's wrong? Coach, why are people born? It's a tough question. Because people love each other. So, what's love? To like someone a lot. So, what do you mean "to like"? Who's someone? Why are babies born from love? I love a very positive movie like this. The main guy falls in love with a poor actress. Then he sings a love song in the rain. He glorifies love. What is love, anyway? I wouldn't cry every night if I knew it. I took a marriage with a love one for granted. But I couldn't love someone I had a daughter with. I love my daughter for sure, but Yuta is... I don't know about that. Listen, Priscilla. I have finally found the last love. Congrats. I'm happy for you. Stop it. This is Cherry. We'll get married. It's true this time. OK, OK. Hey, hey, hey. Great, it's the taste of love. Congratulations. I envy you. Hey, you. I heard Yuta's gone. Yes. If you don't catch him now, you won't forever. You must live more positively. Priscilla!? Oh my god. I'm fine. I just need to take medicine. Don't worry about me. I just need to take care of your stuff. I'm fine. Dad? Can I live with you? What? Mom has a new boyfriend, and they move in together. I feel there's no room for me. I'll help you with some housework. No need. Do you also live with a Woman? No, it's not that... Your friend? Yes... Long time no see. Long time no see. Yesterday, I went back home... Your daughter? Yes, this is Mizuna. It's very nice to meet you. Well, this is... I'm Yutaka. Yutaka Imaizumi. He's been helping me a lot. I see. So, I get going. Mizuna, can you wait here for me? Yuta. Hey. Wait. Listen to me. - Am I embarrassing you? - No. But... Are you ashamed of our relationship? No, but I don't know how to tell her. So what? You can't change who I am. People label others. People ignore different values. Otherwise, they can't survive. Because they feel unsettled. I thought you would be different. Kaido. Hey. You can't live in the same tank, huh? Hey, did you see them? I did. Yuck. They make me puke. Hey, What's so funny? Really creepy, aren't they? Lefties are creepy, too? Any difference? Huh? We work our guts out and pay taxes. We don't commit any crimes. Nothing assholes like you can insult us. Are you a fag, too? What's wrong with it? Apologize. Say sorry. To whom? Stop. Stop. What a hell? What's wrong? You look pitiful. Priscilla, you're rude. Is she coming lately? Rinka? I haven't seen her recently. I think I'm going to ask her out. I don't think she will. She's straight. Maybe, you're right. It may sound exaggerated, but I want to do anything for her. I think I should tell her my feeling. I hope she will show up soon. Speak of the devil. Priscilla, this is a souvenir for you. Thank you, Rinka. From Kagoshima. - Soup stock? - Very delicious. I'll make soup. Thank you. Let's go over there. OK. Let's drink. I can't wait to eat her soup. Well, now it's your turn. Young people are really honest and fearless. You think my life is a mistake? I got married to ease the pain of loneliness. That was just my self-satisfaction. That means your wife is too poor. There was surely love. Otherwise, you wouldn't have a daughter. But eventually it was twisted and gone. Your daughter? My adopted daughter, but I haven't seen her for about three years. We shouldn't regret our lives, should we? I think that we all are athletes. We're worried, get hurt and sometimes laugh. And we work very hard to survive. I think that is what matters most. I'm gonna try again, too. Wish me luck. Makoto, why do you always sneak around to change? What? Do you wanna fight? Com'on! Don't you have a dick? Makoto is gay. Makoto is gay. Stop it. Why don't you fight back? It means I lose. I wanna be strong. Really, really... strong. Sorry for asking you out. I'll forgive you if you go shopping with me. What? What's wrong, dad? There's someone I love. A little hard to tell you... I love a man. Seriously? Is it the man I met the other day? Are you... un... gay, too? I don't know. But... I've just realized I love him. Can't you bear? I'm not sure. But I think... he is better than mom's boyfriend. Good. Yutaka? I don't know. I only chatted him a couple of times with this app. No, I haven't seen him. I was wondering about him lately. I'm sorry. But I'll ask around. Thank you. My contact number is... Yutaka? The doctor says dad will only live for a few days. Since mom died, he used to talk a lot about you. So, just come back home. "Atsushi" Oh, it's you. I've found someone who knows about Yutaka. Where is the guy? I saw Yuta once three days ago. He looked wasted. And? He said he was going to face his father. Where is his hometown? Maybe seaside. In Chiba... Yes, Katsuura. Please. Bring him back to me. I'll take him to France. Yutaka, I'm going to a shop. Dad, can you hear me? I am... I'm a little different. I couldn't say it when I was in junior high school. I was scared... of being denied. That's why I ran away. I... I like men. Sorry for not telling you this. I said sorry, so say something. You heard me, right? Say something. Please. Sorry for being such a son. I'm sorry. Sorry... I've been searching for you. I came here to pick you up. Go home. You should be with your daughter. We live in different worlds. A while ago, you asked me about the world I see. That's something no one knows. We don't understand others completely. But, I believe we can overcome a wall of individual difference with wisdom. So, bet on that possibility for now. One year later This is Kaido. How are you? What did they say? Really? Great. Could you prepare for a dinner? Thank you. Talk to you later. "Mimosa" Hello? Where's your tie? I got ahead of myself. Wow! You really got married. In Hawaii. We tied the knot in Hawaii. How about you two? The best friends. It is fine, too I guess. Yeah, exactly. I see. You look good together, right. Really? Yes. Long time no see. Hi Kaido, good to see you again. Her daughter? Thank you for being friends of my mother. Priscilla's daughter? Yes. Did you guys know her? No. Such a pretty girl... Yutaka is in Paris. He said he doesn't need my help and left alone. I see. She was the worst mother. As she earned little, she worked day and night not to allow me to live uncomfortably. For the adopted daughter. When I had a boyfriend, she said he was bad for me and objected to our dating. So. I ran away with him. Soon after, he ran away. She was right about him. How annoying. She scolded me once. I asked her advice on piercing. She said don't hurt the body my parents gave. She supported to take it off, though. I always thought of her as a mother in Tokyo, but one day she said she was from Hyogo. What a woman. She understood us completely, but we don't understand her at all. This is the song Priscilla loved. I remember it. I do, too. I listened to it a lot. I knew you would come. For now.
