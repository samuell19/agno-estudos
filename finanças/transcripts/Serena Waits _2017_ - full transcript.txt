I notice you seem a little tense in your movements tonight. - Oh, I'm sorry, didn't realize that. - It's fine, it's fine. Let me show you something. Let's have you look away from the mirror because that's probably distracting you. Now, I want you to just breathe. In and out. Okay, keep breathing. Now, feel this tension in here? - Yeah. - All right, we're gonna let that go on the exhale as you move into the next position. You ready? Inhale and switch. Let everything go. Let your muscles relax, let everything go. Loose, loose, let loose, let loose, let loose. Good, there, you see? Is that better? - Yeah, thanks so much, Mr. Samuels. It feels better. - Please, call me Elijah. - Okay, thanks, Elijah. I'll see you next week. - Okay. Actually, I do offer private lessons on occasion for more one on one attention.

Hello, Miles are you here? - Shit, Scott. - Are you fucking kidding me? - He can help us move her. He doesn't, he doesn't, he won't say anything. He doesn't drink, so he can just drive us out of here. - I'll drive myself, alright? - Jack, don't. Jack, look we can't. Okay, you've been drinking, I've been drinking. We're both wasted. We got to dump this bitch somewhere. Look, this is gonna heal. This will be fine, this will heal but man if we get a DUI, we are fucked. Okay, the coach will suspend you, fuck he'll suspend both of us. - I don't fucking trust Scott. He's Mexican. - Look I know Scott, okay, I'll vouch for him.

She came at us and we have to get her out of, we just have to get her out of here before she wakes up or we are all fucked. Okay?

Trust me, my word goes a long way. Right? We just can't have the cops around here. Alright? So what do you say, are you in? Delta Gamma Theta, dude. - Just don't want the cops, Scott. - Yeah, yeah.

What the fuck man? Go, drive. - Uh where are we going? - Just fucking keep driving, Scott. - Why is there blood on that blanket? - Stop asking so many fucking questions, Scott. We did what we had to do. - You weren't there, Scott. Shes' fucking crazy. Attacked us. I mean she was coked up or something. - Who is she? - Its not important. What's important is that we get rid of her so that nobody can turn us in. - Turn you in? Like for what? I mean, if she attacked you you've got nothing to worry about, right? Look, we can just call the cops. - No, fuck that. - Are you fucking stupid, Scott? Police always believe the woman. If anybody finds out about this, we're fucked. We'll be expelled. Do you get it? - Well, what about when she wakes up? - I wouldn't worry about that. - Miles, delete those pictures off your phone. - What? - And the video, do it now. You, too, Scott. - I will as soon as I pull over. - No, do it now! - There, its done. - Show me. - What? - Show me your fucking phones. - She's dead, isn't she? - Pull over here. Listen. What's done is done and nothings gonna change that and I sure as hell am not gonna throw away my future for some dumb bitch I don't even fucking know. Miles, how is your dad gonna feel when he finds out about this? Its not gonna look too good in the papers, is it? Hows that press conference gonna go? - Bad. - That's right. And why's that? - Because, because nobody has to know. - You're goddamn right. Now you Scott, say it. - I um. - Just fucking say it, Scott. Nobody has to know. Its not fucking hard. - Nobody? Nobody-- - The fucking words, Scott. Just say nobody has to know. I swear to god. - Just say it, Scott. We are in this together. - Nobody has to know. - Good. Pull over up here. - Hello? Hey baby. - Yeah. Hey Trini. Uh, um. What's going on? What are you so upset about? - Nothing, nothing. I'm just home alone-- Okay great, I'll come over. I have something to give you. - You know baby, actually, I do want to see you right now but I'm kind of busy. I'll be there in 20 minutes, okay? - I have research to do and-- - Okay, bye. Hey Scott? Man can you open up, I got to talk to you. - Who is it? - Can we just shut the fuck up and open the door? You know who it is. Oh hey. Buddy, congrats. - Hey, Miles. - You know, first base is gonna get a lot of action this year, so, we're counting on you, bud. - Yeah. - You gonna let me in? I would love to see the new place. - Nows not a good time. - Just for like one minute man, I promise. - Trini is actually coming over, so um. - Trini? - She's my girlfriend, man. - Oh yeah. Yeah.

You mind if I have a glass? - Sure, go ahead. - Thanks. That's uh. That's real good. - Miles, what did you need to talk about? - You're a psych major, right? - Yeah. - I've got a question for you man. Its gonna sound kinda gay. I know its. - What is it, Miles? - Look I guess I wanted to know if you know how to repress dreams. Does that make any sense? - So you want to stop dreaming? - Yeah, I guess, kinda. You see, I've been having these nightmares and they've been getting pretty bad and its, its freaking me out. - Yeah, well, me too. - You have? - No shit, Sherlock. Every goddamn night. Every time I close my eyes. After what we've done. - No, no fuck that. If Jack knew that you were bringing that up. - He'd do what? Huh, huh? ♪ I don't care what you think ♪ ♪ Won't let you bother me ♪ ♪ I don't care what you say ♪ ♪ Oh no oh no ♪ ♪ We're not here to look at ♪ ♪ We're just here to dance ♪ ♪ Don't ever fucking touch me ♪ ♪ Please go fuck off ♪ ♪ Fuck off ♪ - Jack, Wendy just texted, she wants to meet up. ♪ Fuck off ♪ Jack? Are you okay? Jack? - Yeah, yeah, no, no I'm fine. I'm fine. Its nothing. - Can we go pick her up? - Yeah, yeah. I don't give a shit, babe. Whatever you want to do. - I'm not talking about that, okay? Look I've had my nightmares, too. Okay but I'm over that. Fuck man, people make mistakes and she shouldn't of been that fucking drunk in the first place. - That's ridiculous, Miles. - Maybe I shouldn't of either okay or Jack. Though as I recall, you were fucking toking up as well. Look, I'm not here to talk about that, okay? I'm here because I've been having nightmares, okay, bad ones. Okay, if it feels like I'm not even asleep, like they're happening in real life. - No shit. You killed someone. - We don't fucking know, that, okay? No one saw anything. There were no fucking cameras in the alleyway, right? - I've been looking online and I haven't been able to find anything. Nothing about a missing girl or a hurt girl. - Yeah, me neither. Believe me, I have tried, okay but maybe its not as bad as we thought. Right? - Maybe you're, maybe you're right? Hand me my glass. So what happens in these dreams? - Its bizarre man. It started, it started happening a few weeks ago. I was laying in bed and then I started hearing this strange, this scratching noise outside my window and at first, I thought it was a dream but the next night, it got worse. It was scratching and then tapping and knocking and, and then it just got worse and worse and then it just started to seem when I was happening when I was awake. I would wake up and I would still hear and I would walk outside and it would just stop. - Scratching, like fingernails on a window. - No. I found this outside my window. - Jesus. Do you think that maybe someones after you? - Why would someone be after me? I haven't fucking done shit to anyone. Whatever man, that's beside. The point is, maybe its all just been a bad dream. I don't know, maybe I, maybe I've been sleep walking or something. - Well then how do you explain the knife? - I don't know, that's why I wanted to talk to you. - Wait, why are you looking at me like that? What the hells that supposed to mean? - Was it you? - What? - Look man, I know we put you in a rough spot, okay we put you in a rough spot but if you're trying to like send a message to me or something or if you're trying to prove some kind of point then this fucking needs to stop. - Okay, you know that's enough, Miles. I haven't been back to that frat house since that night. Since I moved out and I've got no interest in going back there. Okay? - Have you fucking told anyone? Trina maybe? - Trini. No I haven't told anyone shit. Like you said, you got away with it. - There's someone at your door, man. You gonna answer it? Or have you been hearing it, too? - Hey, Trini. - Hi. Girls were so jealous when I told them. - Told them what? - That I'm dating the only freshman on the team, silly. I'm gonna get into Phi Beta Lambda because of you. - Um, listen Trini, I actually have some company over now. - Do you have a girl here or something? - No. Its just Miles. - Miles, I love Miles. He's so sweet. - Yeah, um. We're actually in the middle of something right now. Yeah, hold on I'll ask him. - Do you want me to leave? - Hey, Scott. What's your address? 1743 Elm. - Apartment number? - D, who are you talking to? - Uh yeah. So its 1743 Elm apartment D. You're having a party and didn't invite me? - Yeah, dope ass pool. - You're acting kind of weird. Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. I'm just, um today I've had a lot on my mind. Today, um. - Its not just today, you've been like this for awhile. Do you even know what day it is? - Saturday. - No silly, its our three month anniversary. Here. Open it. - Oh, god. Three months? I completely forgot. - It's okay. Go ahead. - Roses are red, violets are blue, I'm not wearing any panties so tonight lets... Trini, this is dirty. - Its been three months.

You look good. - Oh thank you very much. I am working out at a new gym. Plenty of hot chicks there. Yeah. - I was telling Scotty here that I'm gonna be joining the Lamdas. - Oh, no, no, no. Lamdas are a bunch of skanks. No, you want to go for the Omegas. That's where the classy chicks are at. - Miles, who were you talking to? - Oh it was, it was Jack. He's gonna drop by. - So you are having a party and didn't invite me. - No, no I'm not having a party. Miles. Dude, why did you invite him over? - Well he wants to come over and congratulate you. Plus, he's, bringing over some chick he thinks I'll be into. - Oh sounds like date now. - Yeah, good thing, too. I haven't fucking blasted in a chick in like a week. - Dude, show some respect. - Oh I don't mind. Its kind of sexy. - Oh. Girl, maybe you ought to be a Lamda after all. - You know, that is so typical of you, Miles. - What, what are you talking about? - Like, you didn't even think to ask me before inviting a bunch of people to my house. - A bunch, just three people. - Oh, three. - Yeah. - Three people. - Yeah. Jack, Jack's girlfriend, and the girl that I'm gonna get into. - Oh my, dude you know I'm busy right now. I'm researching. - Scotty, its fine. It will be like a night in your honor. Miles, we weren't doing anything. He's just being a party pooper - I like you, Trini. You got a good girl, Scott. - Okay, one drink. One drink, you can stay for one drink. Okay, but no late night binging, okay? - One drink, I promise. One drink. By your dope ass fucking pool. - I got you babe, don't worry. Hey, how you liking that new bat, slugger? - It's fine. Thanks, Jack. Congrats on placing the draft. - Thanks, bro. Hey you're gonna be able to knock that shit right out of the park, aren't you? - So that's when I realized that I could run a 4:45 mile. Yeah. I'm fucking fast. - Scott, I love your pool. - Um, thank you. Sandy is it? - What, did Jack not tell you about me? - No, no I told him babe. This guy just smokes way too much weed. - Well you need to get out of that frat house and get your own apartment because I want a pool. - Relax, babe. You'll have it soon enough. When they finalize that contract, you'll have whatever pool you want. - I can't believe I get to swim here whenever I want I'm in heaven. - Yeah, its pretty cool I guess, whatever. Hey, you want to take a shot with us? - No, I'm fine. - Alright, cause I know you like to smoke more than you like to drink. I'm gonna go roll you a doobie of the finest shit we got here in Southern California. What do you think? You in? - I'm into that. - Tripsys. Fuck yeah. You need to loosen up, Scott. - And then we won silver at nationals. Fucking silver. Like which is obviously fucking bullshit because the other side was using crank and you can't, you can't compete with that. Like, could, could you compete like with that, and I don't, like softball maybe? Is that the kind of sport that women are into? Do they use crank in softball? You get my point look. The point is. I got my dad to send a letter to the judicial committee just ripping them a new asshole. Just right there pulling it open threatening to fucking take their funding right out of their ass-- - Its Miles right? - And you're? Willow? - Wendy. - Wendy. - First things first, Miles. If you're trying to get into a girls pants. Remember her name. Then maybe ask her a question about herself, you know? Maybe you can try to find out something interesting about me girls are into that. - Oh. Yeah, uh. What kind of music do you like? Wendy? - I'm really happy for you. I know we haven't been together long but I know this is something you really wanted. Its okay to enjoy the moment. Relax. Celebrate. Have a little fun, you know? If there's something bothering you, anything you can tell me. - I've been hearing things in my apartment. - Like what? - Knocking, in the middle of the night. There's never anybody there. - Maybe its just rusty pipes or something. - Its not pipes, Trini. I think its something else. - Maybe its a ghost. What maybe. Oh come on. - Yeah. - Hey, okay. - So I really feel like Limp Bizkit is incredibly underappreciated, you know. Like nobody like really thinks about the fact that he actually combined rap with fucking metal. I mean, like how fucking insane is that? Like, have you like actually like taken, like Papa Roach, too. Holy fucking shit, just... Oh. Okay. Playing hard to get. Okay Wendy. Take my shirt off in a flourish. I'm game. What's up? Fucking cannonball, bitches. - You're a fucking animal, bro. - Fuck its cold. Your balls suck up in you, dude? Oh they're way up in there, bro. Its not that bad. - That's easy for you to say, you don't have them. - Stop being a puss. - Oh fuck you. - Fuck you, dude. - Never have I ever been to Europe. - Germany and Amsterdam. Fucking amazing women in Amsterdam. - Doesn't count if you had to pay for it bro. - They take credit cards by the way. What about you, Wendy, where you been? - Germany, Italy, France, Greece. Pretty much everywhere. - That must of been amazing. - It just feels like a different world over there. Not like America. You can just feel the spirits in the air. All the history, the people. Lots of fascinating experiences. How long were you there for? - On and off for about three years. I was dating a guy but it didn't work out. - Oh god, don't bring up Steven. - Steven? - Oh who's Steven? - My ex. Lets just say I had to Brexit that shit. - I got one, okay. Never have I ever hit a home run in a baseball game. Does Tball count? - That's cute, babe. - Okay my turn. Never have I ever had sex at a party. - Well, we can count Scotty out of this one. - Wow, that's really nice of you Miles. - What, unless you've gotten some and haven't fucking told us. We used to call this fucking guy Scotty V in the dugout. - That's right. - What's that mean? - That means this little shit wouldn't know what to do to a pussy if he fell inside one. - You guys are assholes. God, that's sweet, Scott. - Thanks. Yeah not everyone fucks everything with two legs. - Sometimes they don't have to have two legs. - Maybe he's just waiting for the right girl to come along? - Oh please. That's a bunch of shit. This games a bunch of shit. Scott's barely drank anything. Can we move on, play something else maybe? - Who cares. I think you've had too much. - Scott's barely had two sips of that thing. It looks like he's gonna fucking puke already. Oh. Big man. - Oh get it, boy. Go, go, go. Go, go, go, go. - Alright. - He's gonna throw up. - Alright. - What do you think of that, Jack? - Fucking burn, man. That's what I'm talking about. - Not bad for a fucking rookie. - So who'd you hook up with? - Yeah, tell us. - It was nothing. Its just a few flings. - A few? - Tell everyone about it. Let's hear it. - No, no. Look, this game, let's just moved on. - No, no what's the matter Jack? Do you have something to say or have you had enough? - No, I just think this games for fucking faggots. - Okay, you don't need to get so upset. Its just a game. - If its just a fucking game, then drop it, alright. - You don't need to feel so bad, Jack. You're not the only one that's had party hookups. - Who hasn't? - I haven't. I only like to sleep with people I really care about. - Aw, somebody get Trini a medal. Miss pure and, oh my god you guys are like a fucking couple on a Hallmark card. Jesus Christ. - Alright, Miles, I said drop it. Look, I got an idea. Go get my weed out of the car. - What, your legs broken? Okay. Alright. Where you park? - Alright, that's it for you. - Hey Wendy, you want to come-- - I'm good here, thank you. - Cool, okay. Fuck you buddy. Better than getting rejected in the parking lot. - Ah, suck a cock. - No you're not. - I don't get it. You're never gonna play baseball at this rate. - What's the matter, Miles? You look like you've seen a ghost. - Miles, what's wrong? - You got my weed? - Scott, can I have a word with you, please? What's going on? - In private. - Oh. Girl talk. - Sure, no problem. - I saw something outside. - What the hell is that supposed to mean? - I saw her. - What? - The fucking girl from the party, man. I saw her, Scott. - You can't be serious. - She was there. She was. I don't know how to say this but she. She didn't look good. - Did she see you run up here? - She had knives on her hand, man. She was wrapped in a blanket and she was fucking covered in blood. - What are you ladies doing in here? - Nothing, man. - Are you sure it was the same girl? - What are you guys talking about? - Nothing, bro. - Miles saw someone outside just now. - Oh yeah? Who did you see, Miles? - Miles, tell him. - I saw a girl wrapped in a blanket. - Shut the fuck up. I told you that if you ever talked about this again, I'd fucking kill you. Did you guys think I was fucking around when I said that? - Look, Jack I'm fucking serious, man. She was like undead or some shit. - Listen Miles, nobody's out there. That girl is dead and gone forever. You hear me? - How can you be so sure? - Because I caved her skull in with a fucking baseball bat, Scott. That's how. - Someone wrote on your car, man. It said Serena. I don't know what it means. - It doesn't mean shit. - Baby, where are you going? Jack, where are you going? - Someone vandalized my car. I'm gonna check it out. - Are you serious? - Douche bag. - Is that why you're so freaked out, Miles - What did it say? - It said Delta Beta Lambda. Just fucking faggots on the swim team. They want Jack, real bad. - Scott, Scott where are you going? Scott, wait up. Scott, wait up. Where you going? - I'm just making sure Jack is okay. - He's fine. He's just going to his car. - Trini, there is something going on. - What, he'll get his car fixed. - No, no, no. It's not that. Jesus. - What, Scott what is it? - It's Miles, Miles he's been hearing things. He's been having nightmares, seeing some stuff and there's been sounds. - Like the knocking you were talking about? - Trini, Trini. I did something bad. - Scott... - And I think its all connected. - Scott, what did you do? - I've been, I've been having nightmares, too. I've been seeing things that aren't there, hearing knocking in the middle of the night and no ones. I hear scratching and whispers, Trini. Its affected both of us - Hey, what are we talking about? - Nothing. How was your car? - Its fine, there's nothing wrong with it. Miles is a liar. Everything okay, Scott? - Yeah, yeah. Let's all just go back upstairs. - Yeah, let's go back upstairs. After you. - How's the car? - There's nothing wrong with it. Miles is a fucking liar. - But I saw-- - I said there's nothing wrong with it. Drop it. - Jack. - Okay. - Jack, you don't have to be such a jerk. - Hey, I don't have to listen to anything you say, alright? - Maybe we should just go. - Yeah. - Yeah, there's something going on with you guys and its getting weird. Miles, can you take Jack home? Scott, the door. - Scott, the fucking door. Are you gonna answer it? - I didn't hear anything. - Are you fucking retarded? - What's that supposed to mean? - Oh god, its her. - Its who. What are you talking about? - Trini, Trini, you heard that right? You heard that? - Someones just fucking with us. - You guys heard that right? You guys didn't hear that? Oh some fucking ghost type shit. - Are you guys fucking high or something? - Don't joke about that, okay? - Miles what do you mean ghost shit? - Miles, I've been hearing it, too. Everything. - No. - Everything, yes. The knocking and even the whispers. - No, its a bad dream. Its all a bad fucking dream. - What are you talking about? - There hasn't been any knocking, guys. - You guys are acting fucking insane. - You, you heard it. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Shut the fuck up and stop playing games. - Calm down, Jack. - Hey fuck you, we all heard it. Plain as day. - Jack, there's no one out there. - Its her. - Stop fucking saying that, Miles. - Scott, they're freaking me out - You guys are all crazy. - Miles, who are you talking about? Jack have you been hearing things too? Its possible that whatever this is is only affecting you three for some reason. - Oh fuck you. The only thing I keep hearing is a bunch of bullshit. - Wendy, what did you mean by that? - Look, look. I don't know if you guys are just fucking with us or what but if what you're saying is true then maybe you guys are sharing the same paranormal experience. - Paranormal experience. - I mean maybe its possible that an entity is trying to communicate with you guys for some reason. - But only them three? I mean that seems to be random. - I don't know. - It seems like you know a lot about this shit. - Well you know a lot about baseball. Everyone has their hobbies. - How would they get rid of it? - Have you guys ever tried to communicate with it? - Oh fucking horseshit. I don't buy any of this. Someones fucking with us and when I find them, they're fucking dead. - How do we get rid of it, Wendy? - Maybe you could try to speak with it. Ask it what it wants. Maybe it needs something. - Fuck this voodoo shit. - Jack, why don't you just shut it, okay? Hey, fuck you! - That's enough! Wendy. Tell us what we need. - Do you have any candles? Everyone clear your minds, be open to anything. Let us know if you hear anything. - I can't believe you have this many candles, Scott. So fucking gay. - Jack, listen. Just be quiet for five minutes. - Okay, let's see what happens. We're calling to the spirit that is present. We're calling to you with peace and love in our hearts. We're calling to you from the world of the living. Can you hear us? - See, I told you this shit is fucking stupid. - I heard a knock. - I heard it, too. - Holy fuck. We hear you spirit, we hear you reaching out to us. Are you here with peace in your heart? Are you, are you here with anger in your heart? - There's no fucking ghost. There's nothing out there. - It's fucking knocking on the door, man. - Don't be fucking stupid. There's nothing out there. Ghosts aren't real. - Do you know someone in this apartment? - Three knocks. I heard it. - Guys, I don't want to do this anymore. - Knock it off, Wendy. I don't know how you're doing this but I fucking know you are. - Is it really so hard to believe, Jack? - Scott, tell her to stop. - Did someone hurt you? - Wendy? What's wrong with her? Oh god, she's having a seizure or some shit. - Knock it off. - I better call the police. - The fuck you are. She's just fucking with us. This is all an act. - Maybe I want some Jack. - Shut the fuck up. What I tell you? What I tell you? Jesus Christ. - This is all just an act. It was you, huh? I knew I couldn't fucking trust you. You fucking Mexican. - Jack, Jack. What the fuck are you doing? - Jack, put that down. - Shut the fuck up. You're all in on it. Aren't you? - I'm calling the police. - The fuck you are. All of you, huh? You're all behind this. Why are you trying to freak me out? Who's out there, Wendy? Who's out there? - I told you, man. - No, fuck you, Miles. I know you're in on this, too. You motherfucker. I thought I could fucking trust you. - I'm not in on this shit, man. - Maybe not, but she is. Why are you fucking with me, Wendy? Who's out there? Why have you been terrorizing me? - Terrorizing you? What are you talking about? - I know its been you all along, you fucking cunt. Scratching at my windows, knocking at my door. Writing on my fucking car. - Oh Jesus Christ. - I don't want to be on this couch anymore! - Sit the fuck back down! - Fuck you! - Jesus Christ. - What did you do. You cut her face, you bastard! Let me go. I'm gonna fucking kill you. Miles, knock him out. - Trini, are you okay? - Yeah, yeah I'm okay. - Maybe, maybe its all over, Miles. Guys, it's gonna be okay. Sandy call 911. - Hi, yes, I need an ambulance. My friend has been attacked. - Miles, we need something to wrap her up, help. - Bathroom. Okay you guys just stay there. If he moves, hit him again. Miles, let's go. Come on. - Scott. The ghost. Who was it? - Scott. You must know something. - I uh. I don't know. - You're lying. Tell us, Scott. And everything will be okay. - Confess it, Scott. - Trini, what are you talking about? - Confess it, tell us what you did. - Miles? Toss me that knife. Keep going. I think he likes it. Keep going. - Miles. Miles, wake up. Shut up. - Miles, wake up, Miles. Miles, please wake up. Miles we're tied up. Miles, wake up, Miles. Miles. Miles. - One of them is awake. - Trini, what the fuck is going on? What is going on? I don't know anything. What's going... What the fuck are you doing? Why the fuck am I, why am I tied up? - Tell us what you did, Scott. - The girl, you killed, Scott. Tell us about the girl you killed. - I didn't kill her. I swear I didn't kill her. Trini, Trini. Please, please. - We're only giving you what you deserve. - Stop. Stop. - Doing what you did. - Trini, please. Stop. - Making things even. - Stop, stop, stop. Please. Please. Trini, please. Trini, please. - I said be quiet! Be quiet. Gag him, I can't concentrate. Please just. - Thanks for the fuck, friend. How does it feel to be helpless, vulnerable, covered in somebody else's sweat and blood? - We don't want to hurt you, Scott. We don't want to hurt any of the men that we meet. We just want to make things right. - I didn't kill anyone. - But you did, Scott. You raped her, you bashed her with a bat and you left her to die! - I didn't know what they did to her. I didn't know. They just asked me to drive them and that was all. I said yes, I did. But I didn't know what they did. I didn't know. - Hand me the phone. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I swear I'm sorry. I didn't, what are you doing? Please just let, stop, just let me go. You know like Freddy, Freddy Kruger, like put knives on your fingers and see how wet she gets. You fucking faggot. - You knew and you did nothing. I'm gonna give her some jack. - How did you get that? - Don't be an idiot, Scott. - You want to meet her, Scott? Do you want to meet Serena? - You see, boys. When Serena came and found us and told us what you had done, we couldn't resist the urge to make things right. - Scott. - Fucking crazy. - Scott. You were a decent guy but just not decent enough. - Now, you learn a lesson. About what happens when you rape. - When you murder. - And worst of all, when you think you can get away with it. Its been so fun getting to know you know these past few weeks, Miles. But now its time to go to sleep. - Fuck you, fucking cunt. Do you know who my fucking father is? You fucking.... no, please. - This is what you get. - Congrats, Scott. You made the team. - And now we leave you like you left me and like all of them left us behind. - Bleeding. - Hurt. - And afraid. - Softly knocking on deaths door. - But don't worry, Scott.
