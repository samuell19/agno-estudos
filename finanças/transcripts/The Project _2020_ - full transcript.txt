- Go, go, go, go. Who the fuck? - No, Jake, no! - Hello? Let me out! Hello? - What are you doing? - What? Nothing. - That doesn't fucking look like nothing. What are you doing? - Melody's hungry. She asked for something. We have stacks of food. - She's hungry? What the fuck is this, a charity? Okay, get the fuck out of there, you stupid fuck. - Fuck off. - What the fuck is this? - Well, she's our prisoner. Like, we don't want her to die. We should feed her. - Shut the fuck up, man. What are you doing? Why? What? Why, do you love this bitch? - This food's going to go bad anyway, we might as well feed her, come on. - Oh my God, you're so stupid. You know that? You know what, do whatever the fuck you want. - Fuck off, Jake. - I'm done. - You awake in there? Did you free yourself yet? I left the key nearby so you can unlock the cuffs. - Where am I? - I can't really talk right now. Ah, you know why. I brought you food. Go and sit on the bed. I'll open the door and set the tray inside. - What am I doing here? - I'll explain later. Go sit on the bed. - Please don't hurt me. - Why would I hurt you? I just don't want you trying to escape. Are you on the bed? - Yes. - I didn't mean for this to happen. Just do as you're told or Jake will get mad. And keep your mouth shut, if you know what I mean. I'm sorry Jake hit you so hard. - I can't believe you guys did this. - She saw us making the sale to Tiny. What were we supposed to do? - You guys just escalated this from a minor drug sale to a fucking kidnapping. - Shut the fuck up. This has nothing to do with you. - This has everything to do with me. It's my house. And now I got some bitch locked up in the basement. - What's done is done. You'll just have to deal with it. - Did she see your faces? - Even if she did, it doesn't matter. Fuckhead here has seen her before. - Where? - At a party I went to in Mill Woods a few weeks back. - So she can pick you out of a lineup? - No way. I never talked to her. She won't remember me. - You remember her, but she won't remember you? Are you sure? - There were a lot of people there. - I don't like risk. - Oh my god, what are we going to do? - I think it's pretty obvious what we've got to do. - You're not killing her, Jake. - She'll run to the cops. - You guys never should have brought her here. - Fuck. - What are we going to do? - I'm going to go talk to her. - No, no, you're not. Stay away from her. - Well, what are we going to do? We can't just keep her here. - Just give me some time to think about it. - Fine. What a fucking asshole. So tell me again what happened? - It's just like Jake said. - I want to hear it from you. - Like Jake said, we did the deal with Tiny and then we look over and there's this girl staring at us. So Jake ran and grabbed her and knocked her out. And we brought her back here until we can figure out what to do with her. - Was this before or after Tiny left? - After. - So how do you know she saw you guys do the deal? - That's what I said. But Jake said we can't be sure. - If he kills her, we're all going to prison. It's impossible to get away with murder these days. - I won't let him kill her. - I can't believe you guys did this. - It wasn't me, it was Jake. - Five, six, seven, eight. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. - Hello? How are you holding up in there? - Good, I mean, not good. Can you let me out? - Sorry, I can't. Jake would kill me. Shit, I shouldn't have said his name. Don't tell him you know his name. - I won't tell on you. I don't know you. I only moved to Alberta a few days ago. I haven't seen your faces. I don't know where we are. You could just drop me off somewhere. Are you still there? - Yeah, I'll try. - Wait, I need my medication. It's in my purse. Fuck. - I just talked to her. She said she just moved here a few days ago. You didn't see her at some party. - Okay, it probably wasn't her. - You're so fucking stupid. - Can I get some water? Great, thanks. Hey! Somebody get down here. I need water. - Shut up down there. - I'm on the bed and facing the wall. You can leave the water inside the door. - Don't yell like that. If Jake- - You can't keep me locked down here and not give me what I need, Devin. - You'll just have to go along with it. And thanks for lying about not seeing me at the party. I never should have mentioned that to Jake. - Sorry for calling you stupid. You hear from Jake? - He's probably at the bar. - Come here. - We shouldn't be doing this, Ashley. - You didn't have a problem with it last time. - Yeah, well, last time was a mistake. - We can't live our lives being afraid of Jake. - I have. - Why don't we just ditch him? - What do you mean? - Me and you, we run off together. We dig up the money Jake's got buried out back and go. Fuck him. - You guys are getting married. - I didn't want to marry him. - Then why did you say yes? - Is Jake the kind of guy you say no to? - Jake would hunt us down and fucking kill us. And what about my parents? - What about them? Your mom's going to be dead in a few months and your dad's a fucking prick. Go to the hospital, say goodbye to your mom. Then we leave. You want to be in a relationship with me? We can't have Jake around. - Oh, so we're in a relationship now? - You seemed fine with that the last time. - Last time I was drunk and we didn't have an innocent girl locked up in the basement. - Huh. - Are you still in there? - Where else would I be? - What's your name? - Melody. - Melody what? - Dawson. - Look, if we let you go, will you tell the cops there was only one person here, Jake? - Yeah, sure, whatever you guys want. - Okay, just hold on a little bit longer. We'll get you out of there before Jake can get to you. - Okay. Thank you, Ashley. Just please hurry. - How do you know my name? - I think Devin may have mentioned it. Shit. - You told her my fucking name. - What? No, I didn't. - She just called me Ashley. How would she know my name? - Well, you and Jake were yelling at each other, She probably heard you. Fuck. I told you to keep your mouth shut. If Jake finds out you recognize me, he'll kill you. - I don't recognize you. I have no idea who you guys are. I just heard your names when you were yelling upstairs. - Sure, let's go with that. - I swear. I don't know you. Please just let me go. You can blindfold me and drop me off somewhere. I won't tell on you guys. - Jake will never go for that. - I have money. - How hard did Jake hit you? - What? - Are you fucking with me, or do you seriously not know what's going on right now? You don't have to put on this whole act. Just keep quiet and I'll take care of it. - I seriously don't know what's going on. You can just blindfold me and drop me off somewhere. You both can run away from your brother. Nobody has to die. - Yeah, maybe. I don't think we have a blindfold. - Oh my fucking God. You can use a T-shirt, or a pillowcase, or something. - Yeah, I'll think about it. - Are you seriously not fucking with me? - No. - Do you believe her? - Even if she does rat us out, we'll be long gone. She only knows our first names. - Okay, so what's the plan? We need our share of the money from Jake. - He'll be suspicious if we ask him all of a sudden. - Well, we need to get our money somehow. He's only got like, 40 grand buried out there. That won't last long. - Why are you even bothering? You know that you're never going to leave this room. - What the fuck is going on? - What? - Did you hear what we said? - No, I didn't. - Is your dad Conrad Dawson? - Yeah, why? - Okay, just wait there. - Wait there? Where else am I going to go? - Are you really that scared of yourself? - Are you a hallucination? - I don't know. You're the one dreaming me up. - I didn't dream you up. - Maybe I'm the way your brain's dealing with the isolation. - Yeah, maybe. - Or maybe you're just batshit fucking crazy. - I'm not crazy. - Sure, you keep telling yourself that. What do you think they're talking about up there? How to dispose of your body? - They're planning on a way to let me go. - You don't need a plan to let someone go. You just let them go. - No, they're just worried about being caught. They want to run away together and leave that asshole, Jake. There's just, they're scared I'm going to rat them out. - Are you seriously defending them? They kidnapped you. - I'm not defending them. - They're planning something, and drug dealers who kidnap people and lock them in basements don't plan good things. They plan bad things. - Even if I do figure it out, what's the point? I'm at their mercy. - I'm certain that you'll never get out of this room, but you should at least try and stop yourself from getting killed. Maybe you can do something with this. - I'm solving this problem right now. - Jake, put the gun down. - Shut up, stay out of my way. - Do you see where all this led? - Jake, we have a plan. - Help me. - We can make money. - She told us her name- - You were talking to her? - Not the point, Jake. - We can ransom her. - What? You guys are stupid. - We might be able to get like $1 million, Jake. - Yeah? Fuck it. We'd get caught. - No, we won't. We'll plan it. We won't get caught. - You sure about that? - 100%, trust me. - It's worth a shot. - I don't know. I hate this fucking situation. I just want her gone. - If you kill her, you definitely won't get any money. - You're drunk, Jake. You said yourself, you fuck up too many times when you're drunk. Leave it till morning and think about it. - Fine, we'll figure it out tomorrow. Stay of execution, little lady. - It would have been quick. There are worse ways to die. - Shut up. - What on earth are you going to do? - I'm okay for now. If they're going to ransom me, it means they won't kill me. - Yet. - Then how do I get out of here? Help me. - I already gave you a suggestion. - The card. What am I supposed to do with it? - Come on, work with me here. Use that tiny little brain of yours. - I seriously don't know. - Use it to open the lock. - What? I don't know how to do that. - Yes, you do. You've seen it in movies. - Even if I do open the door, how the hell am I supposed to get out of the house? There's three of them up there and they have a gun. I mean, I don't even have any shoes on. - You think you have a better chance locked in here? Above the door handle, Einstein. - It's not working. - Fine. Then give up, wait for them to come kill you. - One, two, three. - How do you know she's not lying? - Why would she lie? - I'm going to ask her. - She's probably scared of you. - She needs to be scared. You listening in there? My brother says your dad is Conrad Dawson, the bald guy from the car commercials. Is that true? - Yeah. - He says he's rich. - Yeah, I guess. - Here's the way it's going to be. We're gonna call that rich dad of yours and give him two choices, give us $1 million or find his little girl's body in a ditch. Write his phone number down. And don't even think of using the pencil as a weapon. I got my gun. You pissed me off, you die. You got five seconds. Five, four, three, two, one. You like cutting it close, don't you? - You're in trouble if they think they can get that money from Daddy. - We're in big fucking trouble. - We? - 911 Emergency. Do you need police, fire, or ambulance? - Police, please. - Hold on while I transfer you. I'll only be off the line for a minute. - What? Hello? Hello? - Okay, I'm transferring you to a detective. - Hello, I'm Detective Goldsmith. How can I help you? - Yes, yes. I've been kidnapped and they're going to kill me. - Okay, okay, calm down. Everything's going to be all right, promise. Now what's your name? - Melody Dawson. - That's a beautiful name. Okay, Melody, tell me what happened. - I can't, I can't remember what happened. - Can't or won't? - I woke up in a room in this basement somewhere, but the room is really weird. The floor, it's 30 feet by eight feet. The floor is plywood and the roof is peaked. It looks like it could be a church or something. And there's blankets all over the wall. It looks like it could be an attic. I don't, I don't know. - Do you have any idea who took you? - Yes, there's two guys and one girl. Their names are Jake, Devin, and Ashley. Jake and Devin are brothers and Ashley is Jake's fiancee. But she's cheating on him with his brother. - How do you know all of this? - I can hear them talking through a vent in the wall. - Can you tell me what they look like? - I haven't seen their faces, but Devin said that he's seen me before. - Where? - At a party that I went to. But I don't remember him. There were a lot of people there and I was drunk. Can you track my phone or something? - I'm already on it, Melody. Don't worry. I'll come save you. In the meantime- - Okay, I have to go. They're coming. I'll call you back, I promise. - Melody, this is going to sound weird, but is there something you can tell me that only you and your dad would know. - What? - I hate to do this to you seeings as I don't even know you, but since we're trying to ransom you, we need to prove that we actually have you. - Okay, well then take a picture of me or let me talk to them. - Mm-mm, they'd see the room. - These amateur kidnappers are smarter than I thought. - So we need a bit of information, a story or something that happened, you know, something that we can tell your dad so that he knows we actually have you. It can be anything. - Okay, just let me think. - Come on, I don't got all day. - Oh, you're not going to tell her that story? Are you? - Shut up. - Hurry up, or Jake will get mad. - Okay. When I was five years old, my parents were going to take me to K-Days. This was around the time that my mom started getting sick and she couldn't go. So I went with my dad. I wandered off and got lost, somehow ended up on the LRT, started crying. Luckily for me, a passenger saw me and called the transit police. They came and got me, found my dad. He'd been freaking out. When he got me, he was so enraged. So when we got home, he yelled at me and then he hit me. I used to think he was so mean. Now I just realize that he was scared. - Okay, I'm sure he'll remember that. - She's in for a surprise. - How much longer are you guys going to keep me in here? - Until we get our money. - Melody, is everything all right? - No, no, they're trying to get money from my dad in exchange for letting me go. But they don't know that my dad's dead. - What's your dad's name? - Conrad. If they find out he's dead and they can't get money from him, they're going to kill me. - That's not going to happen, Melody. - Have you found out where I am yet? - Unfortunately, no. We can't pinpoint your location using GPS, but we have other ways of finding you. We won't stop until we do. Now you said one of the kidnappers recognized you? - Wait, wait. I might be able to find out who he is. Just let me make a few calls and I'll call you right back. - I'll be waiting here by the phone. - Oh, you're not seriously thinking about calling Zak, are you? - Yes, I'm seriously thinking about calling Zak. It might get me out of here. - Well, your pledge to never speak to him again didn't last very long. - Well, the situation's changed, hasn't it? - You know they were having sex while you guys were still together? - Shut up. I don't care anymore. - What do you want, Melody? - Zak, I've been kidnapped. - What? - I swear. I'm locked in a room in a basement somewhere. They're trying to ransom me. But they don't know that my dad is dead. - Your dad's dead? - Yes. - When did he die? - That's not the point right now, Zak. - Is this a joke, Melody? - No, it's not a joke. - Well, have you called the cops? - Course I've called the cops. Look, you have to help me. They're going to kill me. - Kill you? You, you, you just said they're holding you for ransom. - Okay, and what do you think they're going to do when they realize that there's no rich dad to get money from? - I'm not going to argue, Mel. I just don't know what you expect me to think. You've been acting so weird. - Okay, Zak, I swear to you that I'm not lying. - Okay, fine, I believe you. What do you want me to do? - I need you to message Tammy and ask her to send you all the pictures she took at that party at Mill Woods. She won't talk to me, so you have to do it. - What? How is that going to help the situation? - Look, just do it. - You know what, Mel, I'm not going to play your games. - No, just listen. - Goodbye, Melody. - Just who the fuck are you talking to in there? - No one, just myself. - Shut the fuck up. We called your dad. He didn't pick up. So I'm going to give him two hours to call back. And if he doesn't answer, well that's just no good for you. - I think you should call her. - I am not calling Tammy. She probably doesn't want to speak to me anyways. - If I remember correctly, it was you that said he never wanted to speak to her again. - Well, I think the feeling was pretty fucking mutual. - Given your situation, I think you should swallow your pride and call her. - Fuck it, I'll call her. - Hello? - Hi Tammy. It's me, Melody. - Yeah, I know. - Look, I've been- - Kidnapped? Yeah, Zak told me. I just- - What? - Just not sure I believe you. - Tammy, look, I'm not making it up, I promise, okay? You need to help me because they're going to kill me. - Does this have something to do with me and Zak? Because I told you before, me and him never did anything while you guys were together. And you basically told me that you never wanted to talk to us again. - I don't give a fuck you about and Zak, okay? I just care about getting out of here. - Zak said something about a party. - Yes, yes. Just send me all the pictures that you took at that party at Mill Woods. - Which one? - We only went to one. - Oh, right. But I wasn't there long, remember. I don't have many pictures. - Just send me what you have. - What do you need them for? - One of my kidnappers was at the party. If I can recognize him and find out who he is, I could tell the police and they can get his address. - Why don't I just send the pictures to the police? - Do you have their fucking number? - No. - Then just send me the pictures. - Okay, fine. - Bitch. - Melody, are you all right? - No, no. They said that if my dad doesn't give them money in two hours, they're going to kill me. - That won't happen, Melody. You're perfectly safe. - Yeah, that's easy enough for you to say. - You mentioned that party. - Yes, yeah, yeah. My friend, she's gonna send me pictures and I'll have a lead for you right away. - Good thinking, Melody. - I should probably go. They heard me talking last time. - Okay, Melody, you can do this. - Why the fuck is Ashley asking so many questions about what happened today? - I don't know. She's curious. - You haven't been talking to her about it, have you? - No. I just told her the story we came up with, and that's it. - She's smart. You talk about it too much, you'll slip up and she'll know we're lying. - What if she calls Tiny and finds out we never met him today. She could blackmail us or something. - If she does I'll shoot her. - Fuck you Jake. - Just go get in the truck. I'll be there in a minute. - Where are you going now? - We're going to go find a place to do the drop. It's gotta be perfect. Go talk to her and find out if there's another way to contact her dad. - Guess there's no way to contact Dad unless they go to a medium. - He's your dad too. - Not anymore. - Get out of my way, she's coming. - Is there somewhere else we can contact your dad? - Tell her to try his office. Might buy you some time. - You can try his office, but it doesn't open until morning. - I don't think Jake's gonna wait that long. - You're just going to have to convince him. It's night time, people are sleeping. Just convince Jake to wait, for my sake. - Look, sweetie, I don't want Jake to kill you. But don't think I'm going to go out of my way to do something for your sake. - Looks like you struck a cord. - Okay, I'm sorry. - Tell her about Jake and Devin. It'll pit her against them. She'll have to trust you more. - Ashley, Jake and Devin, they're lying to you. What they said happened today didn't really happen. They never spoke to Tiny. - How did you hear them? - I heard them talking under the door. - And why should I believe you? - Because you know it's true. - Because you know it's true. - You'd make up anything to save yourself, wouldn't you? - I'm not lying to you, Ashley. - You better hope your dad can cough up $1 million. - Tammy sent the pictures. - What exactly are you expecting to see, a scary-looking guy, staring at the camera, giving you the evil eye? - I talked to a lot of guys at that party. But Devin said that I didn't talk to him, so just need to find someone that I don't recognize. - I'm impressed. You surprise me. - I surprise myself sometimes. That guy, something about him. - Is that Devin? - It could be. I have to call Tammy and find out. Come on, Tammy. Shit. Call me back ASAP. - Hi, Tiny, it's Ash. Funny question. Did you meet with Devin and Jake today? Okay. No, no reason. I just, I didn't know what was going on, that's all. Yeah, yeah, everything's fine. Just don't tell 'em we talked today, okay? All right, thanks. Fucker. - Look at you, master manipulator. Hey, maybe you should tell Jake that his little bro is fucking his girlfriend. - Are you kidding me? He'll kill the both of them and then I'd have nobody who would want me alive. - Yeah, wow. So many angles to think of. You sure that you can handle it? - I'm going to try Zak again. - You know they're probably together talking about you? - You're not helping. - Just trying to keep you company. Just need to find something to do that'll take my mind off of it. - Perfect time to pick up reading. Better late than never, I guess. - I just don't want to think about what's happening for a while. Is that so wrong? - You escaped once. Try again. I mean, it's the perfect time. Jake's gone. - I dropped the card thing outside. There's no point. - Maybe you can find something in here, like a piece of cardboard, or a book cover. - Do you need help? - Yes, please, please. I've been kidnapped and I just escaped. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Thank you so much. Can you please take me to the police station? - Of course. - I can't believe that I actually made it. Can you drive any faster? - Don't worry. Everything will be okay. You'll get out of here eventually. What are you reading back there? - What? Why am I holding this? Fuck! - Well, that was pathetic. You won't be able to escape if you can't hold it together. - I'm holding it together just fucking fine, okay? I just need my fucking pills. Ashley! - How do you know the guy in the car wasn't Jake? - Because Jake drives a truck. - Ah, touche. Maybe you're smart enough to get out of here after all. - Ashley! - What do you want? - I need my pills again, please. - Okay, hold on. You weren't lying earlier, by the way. I know that now. And Jake said he'll wait until the morning. I'll be back in a sec. - So how exactly are you going to get out of here? If you're waiting for Tammy or Zak to call, you might be dead and decomposed by then. Maybe you can make a weapon and lure them in. - There's no way to lure them. I can't fake being sick. They won't care. - True, but maybe if you ask Ashley nicely for some water to swallow your pills, she'll have to open the door. She trusts you now. - Okay, how do I make a weapon? - Duct tape and handcuffs. If I can figure it out, you can. Ram that into her throat. - I need some water too, please. - Okay, fine. Give me a second. - This is crazy. I can't kill somebody. - You know you can. - Fuck, okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay. All right, I can do this. - Okay, I got you some water. - Just leave it inside the door. - I got a water bottle. I'll stick the straw under the door. - What are you looking at me for? I think you better swallow your pills. - Hurry up. I don't know when Jake will be back. - Say "Thank you." You want to keep her on your side. She's the only thing standing between you and Jake. - Thanks, Ashley. - No problem. - Your phone's buzzing over here. - Look at the pictures you sent me. Do you see the one with me, Madison, and Katie, and there's this weird guy standing behind us? Do you see the photo I mean? - Hold on. Okay, I think I've found it. He's got a black shirt? - Yes, yes, who is that? - I don't know. - Well, whose house was it again? - How can you not remember? You weren't even drinking 'cause of your meds. - Whose party was it? - That MMA guy, Randy something. - Do you know how to get a hold of Randy? - No, but Jackie probably knows. - Well, can you call Jackie? - Why can't you do it? - Because I don't have her number. Look, Tammy, it's really hard to talk right now because they might hear me, and my phone is dying. So please, can you just do this one thing for me? - Have you talked to the police? - Of course. Please, Tammy. - Okay, fine. But you better not be fucking with me. - I'm not fucking with you. - Okay, fine. What was I supposed to do again? - Fuck sakes, Tammy. Just call Jackie and ask for Randy's number to see if he knows the name of that guy. - Fine, I'll do it. - And call me back right away, okay? Tell him that it's urgent. - Okay. - Fuck. - Worried they're going to get mad if they catch you with that? - You know, I'm starting to get really sick of you. - Hm, then I guess we have something in common. You never answered my question. Why'd you hide that thing? Worried they're going to get mad if they catch you with it? Or you can't stand to be reminded of the kind of person you are? - The first one. - Denial, denial, denial. - Shut up, please. Okay, I'm just trying to think. - You're playing into her bullshit. - If there's one in a million chance that she's actually in danger, I would hate myself forever if I didn't help. - Yeah, but you're not helping by playing into her games. We shouldn't engage with her. - I'm just going to do this one thing. - Tammy? - Yeah, so I talked to Randy. - Did you find out that guy's name? - He said it's Dylan or something like that. - Could it be Devin? - I don't know, maybe. He said Dylan or something like that. - Hey, well, can you call back and ask if maybe it was Devin? - I don't think he can remember. He said Dylan or something close to that. - Maybe if you mention Devin it will trigger his mind. Tammy, please, look, they're just going to- - I know, I know. They're going to kill you. - We've been best friends since grade five, Tammy. The least you could do is take my imminent death seriously. - Fine, I'll call him back. - Let me guess, she wants something from you? - She just wants me to check this one guy's name. You don't recognize this guy, do you? - No. I thought she was out of our lives. I'm going to go to the police station to file a report. If she's kidnapped, we can save her. And if she's lying, we can find her and get her some help. - Okay. - So what do you think your odds are of getting out of here? - 50-50, I'd say I got a 50-50 chance. - And what are you going to do if that's not Devin in the photos? - I can play them against each other. - You're going to manipulate Jake? - Can you just stop talking for one second? - You do realize they're all conspiring behind your back, don't you? Jake, Devin, Ashley, Tammy, Zak, Detective Goldsmith. - You don't know what you're talking about. - You know, I find it strange that you're not more surprised to be talking to yourself. I guess that speaks volumes as to how far you've sunk. - Well given the situation, I don't think that you're the biggest threat. - How wrong you are. - Tammy? - Randy says it might be Devin. - How is that any better than what we knew before? You were supposed to find out for sure. - He doesn't know for sure. - Okay, well then just call him back and- - No, Melody, I've done enough. - I can't believe that you're not willing to help me. - I did help. If you really want to be rescued, call the police. - I did! Okay, but they can't find me if they don't know where I am, dumbass. I know what I'm doing. - Yeah, sure you do. Zak was right. - What did Zak say? - He said we shouldn't engage with you. He's going to talk to the police about this whole thing. - Fuck! Fuck. - Great, what now? Yeah? - You're going to talk to the cops? - Yeah, I just pulled up. If you're really kidnapped, I can't just sit around. The police need to know. - I'm already talking to the cops. - Well then, maybe I can help in some way. - Okay, well, what are you going to tell them? - Everything I know. - Look, just don't tell them anything bad. - Anything bad? You said you're going to be killed. - I mean about me. The guy that I'm talking to, Detective Goldsmith, he's the only person that believes me. I don't want him to have any reason to doubt me, Zak. - I'm going to tell them the truth, Mel. - Fuck you, okay? I can't believe you guys would do this to me. - Just hang tight. Whatever you're going through, I'll always be there for you. - I don't need your fucking pity, Zak. - Mel, what happened to your dad? - Don't you have more important things to deal with right now? Like texting that picture to Detective Goldsmith? - I have to go. - Melody. - Did you get the pictures I sent you? - Yes, is that Devin? - I think so. I'm not sure. - Okay, I'll run his picture through our facial recognition software. - Yeah, facial recognition, that's exactly what I was thinking. - I'm good at my job, Melody. I'm always one step ahead. I'll figure this thing out. - Okay, but please hurry. If they call my dad's office in the morning and he's not there, well- - Don't even think a negative thought, Melody. You're a survivor. - My boyfriend, my ex-boyfriend. he said that he was gonna- - Yeah, he just got here, Melody. I'll talk to him. - Okay. What are you guys going to talk about? - I need to check out every angle. I need to know every detail. I can't ignore anything. You understand, right, Melody? - Yeah. I just don't want him to- - I'm coming for you no matter what, Melody. Don't worry about anything. - Okay. What do I do now? - Just hang in there. I'll call you back if I get a lead on this character in the picture. - Okay, thanks. - So you just feel comfortable having an old man tell you everything's going to be okay? - I feel comfortable having someone who doesn't think I'm completely full of shit. At least somebody cares. - Don't you find it odd that the only person that believes you is the one that knows you the least? - You know if I die, you die too? - Of course. I'm looking forward to it. - So am I. - They're back. You want a blindfold and a cigarette? - Ssh. - Devin, tell me what really happened today. - What do you mean? - Don't stall. You know what I mean. - With Melody? I already told you. So did Jake. - Tell me again, but without the bullshit. - Look, I don't know what you're doing, but I told you what happened. - Devin, things will go really bad for you if you fuck me over. - Fuck. - I think you might pull this off after all. - Hey, Tiny, it's Devin. Sorry for calling you so late. Just quick question. Did you talk to Ashley today at all? No, no, there's no drama. I was just wondering. No, no, it's nothing. We're just... Tiny? Shit. Fuck! - Hello? Did you find out if that guy was Devin? Did you get his address? - Whoa, Melody, slow down. Stay calm. It's the only way we're going to get through this. - This is as calm as I'm going to get until I get out of here. - To answer your question, not yet. We're still trying to find out who this guy in the picture is. But don't worry, we got some leads. - Leads? What leads? - Don't worry about that. It's not important at the moment. Listen, I'm at your house right now. - You're at my house? Why? - Looking for evidence? Maybe the people who took you came here. - Melody, does anyone else live here? - My parents did, but they're both dead. - Your mom's dead too? - Yeah. - I'm sorry to hear that. - It's not your fault. - Melody, that boy you sent me the picture of, has he ever been in your room? - Of course not. Why? - Just asking. I don't want to cause you any more pain, but how did your parents die? - My mom had cancer. She got worse over the last few years. And she died on New Year's Eve. - It's a terrible disease. - Yeah. I was almost glad though. At least she wasn't in pain anymore. - Oh, please. Don't pretend like you have a heart. - Look, you said you had leads? - Yeah, I got a couple of things I'm checking out. I'm getting close, that's for sure. - Okay, 'cause I only have until morning. And they said, if my dad doesn't answer, then they're going to- - Melody, be strong. I'm close, I'm real close. You keep doing what you're doing, you'll be out of that room before you know it. - Okay, okay, thank you. - You awake in there? - I can't exactly sleep at a time like this. - Yeah, stupid question. - Is everything okay? - No, not at all. I don't know what those guys are planning, but I think they're going to fuck me over. - Go with it. - Yeah, they're definitely gonna fuck you over. - I guess I become too dependent on people. I used to only have to look out for myself. I've lived on my own since I was 14. Ran away from home, my dad, well. I met Jake and I thought he was tough enough to protect me. As a badass 16 year old it seemed like the wise choice. But people get smarter as they get older. So I thought being with Devin was the better option. Turns out he's a fucking loser too. I can't believe they both betrayed me. - Everyone fucks you over in the end. Sometimes it's just better to be alone. - It's funny, you're the only one here I can trust. You're the only one that hasn't lied to me. - I trust you too. So what are we going to do? How are we going to get out of this mess? - Kill Devin and Jake. - No. - Yes, do it. It's the only way. - Maybe, maybe the only way is to kill Devin and Jake. That way you can let me go and you can have all the money for yourself. - How do I know you won't blackmail me for a cut of the money? - I don't need it. My inheritance is much more. - Nice one. - I've never killed anybody before. - You can do it. - Yeah, it's the only way. - But how are you going to get Jake's gun? - I've got my own gun. The guys don't know about it. Okay, this is how we'll do it. I'll kill them both real quick. Bullet to the head each. We don't have long before you dad's dealership opens. I'll call him. He'll drop off the money. Then I'll come back here and let you out. Not before. - Okay, sure. - Are you sure your dad will give us the money? - Of course he will. Why wouldn't he? I'm sick of this shit. I'm a fucking adult. I want to live in my own place. You're smothering me. - You can't live on your own. You wouldn't be able to support yourself, because you're sick, Melody. - I'm not sick. It's Devin. He's just standing there. - He likes you, you know? You could get him to do what you want if you tried hard enough. - Yeah, anything I want, except let me fuck out of here. Now stop talking. - Hey, Jake, it's me. She knows. No, I didn't tell her. She figured it out. Well how the hell should I know? I don't think she knows what really happened, but she knows we're lying. She threatened me. Go now? But we have to wait for her dad to call. Okay, fine. But don't kill her. - Which her do you think he meant? - Hey, Melody. - Yeah? - Change of plan. Jake wants me to go to the money drop and wait. He's going to call your dad, tell him where to leave the money. But don't worry, everything's going to be okay. This is just a little detour. Everything's gonna work out. Just like we planned it. - Uh-oh. - You know, if you'd only been there five minutes earlier we would have been long gone before Jake showed up. Don't worry. We'll figure it out. - What? What are you talking about? What the fuck is he talking about? - I only know what you know, but you only have a few minutes until Jake is back and they call your dad and realize that they're not going to get their money. - Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay, no, no, I have a plan. Just get the fuck out of my way. - Tammy, you should get down here. They want to talk to you too. They found the guy in Melody's picture. Yeah, they arrested him. So they got him here now. So it seems like that part of her story was true, but nothing else is. - Melody. - Hi, I have a plan. I can't believe that I didn't think of it sooner. - I'm all ears. - Okay, so you know that they're going to be calling my dad's office any minute now, which means I don't have very much longer left to live. But if I can give them your number and tell them that it's my dad's private line, you could pose as my dad and arrange for them to get their money. That way we can stall them for longer and you can find me. - Brilliant, Melody. I can't believe I didn't think of it. - Okay, I'm going to give them the number, and just wait for their call. - You got it. Melody, just one quick question. What day did your dad die? - What? I don't remember. Maybe a Tuesday. Look, I have to go. - Sorry, just one more question. The night of the party in Mill Woods, did anybody come home with you? - No, I took a cab home by myself. Okay, just wait for their call please. Ashley, get down here. Ashley! - What is it? - I'm not sure if my dad's going to pick up at his office. So I'm just going to give you his private number. You can reach him there for sure. - You'll have to write it down. We can't use our cell phones. They can be traced. We use a payphone. - Where are you going to find a payphone? - They still have them at LRT stations. - I'm surprised you're playing so well, seeing as you might die any minute now. - I'm not going to die. It's going to work. I just need to keep my mind sharp. I need to think about strategy. - And to you keeping your mind sharp means playing chess with your imaginary self? - Fuck you, I'm winning. - Give me the number. I'm going to go make the call. - I'm coming too. - No, you're not. Wait here. - Why can't I come? - 'Cause I fucking said so. - Well fuck you, Jake. I know you and Dev are lying about what happened today. - Oh yeah? And what are you going to do about it? - I just want to know what really happened. - You want to know what happened. I got in a fight with Kevin Miller. You know the little fucker that bought the plant's office? And he fucking died. It was an accident, but it happened. I needed help burying the body. So I called Devin and met him out at the park. We'd just finished dragging the body into the trees and that bitch downstairs shows up. - Did she see you with the body? - It doesn't matter. She could place us at the scene. I was going to shoot her right then and there, but Devin talked me out of it. I should've done it the second he said he knew her from somewhere. - But if you did, we wouldn't be getting the $1 million. - Yeah, but you see why we can't let her go now? - Why didn't you just tell me that? You should know by now that you can trust me. - I don't trust anyone. Now wait here. I'll go make the call. Then I'll meet Devin at the drop point. We'll come back with the money. - Fine. Hey. - Why didn't you shoot him? - I didn't get a chance. I want to shoot the both at the same time, but Devin took off to go to the drop. - Okay, well what are we going to do now? - Jake is making the call. As long as your dad drops off the money, like you say he will, they'll bring it back here and then I'll shoot them both, take the money, and set you free. - What if they don't come back? What if they're planning to take the money and run, leaving you sitting here looking like an idiot? - They won't do that. Jake told me why they were lying. I pretended to be cool with it. Just hang on a little longer. Pray your dad comes through with the money. - Tammy? - Why aren't you doing this? - Doing what? - You know what. - No, I don't. - You need help. - Yes, I need help. They're going to kill me. - That's not what I mean. I just want you to be back to normal. Even if we can't be friends, I just want you to be okay. I really wish things could go back to the way they used to be with us. Look, just go to my place. Me and Zak will meet you there. Then we can talk the whole thing out and make sure you get the help you need. - Have you lost your fucking mind? I would give anything to be able to get out of here, to be able to go anywhere, to be at your place. I, I am locked in this fucking room and I can't get out. And you guys don't believe me. Just listen. Did you hear that? Four walls. I'm locked in. - Melody, stop it. We're at the police station. They found that Devin guy. They're talking to him right now. - Great, so then you guys can finally find me. - And he's totally freaking out that your dad is dead. He said you made the whole thing up, Melody. - He's lying. Quiet so we don't wake my dad. - Okay, okay, just calm down. Here, Zak wants to talk to you. - Melody, just go to Tammy's place, okay? Everything's going to be fine. - When are you two fuckheads going to realize that I can't go anywhere? I'm not lying. I am trapped in this room. - So then tell us where you are and we'll come get you. We will let you out. - If I knew where it was, I would have already called the cops and I would have already been free. Okay, stop victim blaming and tell that asshole Devin to tell you where the fuck I am! - Melody, if you tell us where you are, Tammy and I will stop seeing each other. - Oh god. You really think that this is all about you two? Let me tell you something, Zak. I don't give a fuck if you're dating, I don't give a fuck who you're fucking. We are not together. I care about getting the fuck out of here. Why don't any of you believe me? - Because you're lying. - Because you're lying, Melody. We're getting the whole story, now. - Yes, his story. You're taking the word of a drug-dealing kidnapper over the person that he kidnapped. Well, you know what? That's fine. You two assholes are gonna be so fucking sorry when you see on the news that they found my body and they're- - Okay, Melody, okay. Just don't do anything to yourself. - I'm not going to do anything to myself, okay? I am going to get the fuck out of here. I don't care what it takes. I'm going to get out of here. And when I do, I'm going to find you and I'm going to say right to your fucking face that- - My God. - Is there anything else we can do for her? - No. - Oh, fuck! - Melody. - Is Devin really there? - Yeah, his name is Devin Harvey. He's sitting right in front of me. Give me a sec. I'm going to go where I can talk. - Why did you guys find him? - He got pulled over on the Whitemud for speeding. Turns out he has outstanding warrants. The arresting officer brought him in. When I heard a young fella named Devin was brought in, bingo, same guy as in your picture. - Okay. Well, is he saying anything? - Oh, he's saying a whole lot, but I don't necessarily believe him. - Okay, good. - People will say anything to save their skin, to cover up what they did. - Yeah, exactly. Can you make him tell you where I am? - I'm working on it. It's not like the old days where you can just beat a confession out of a suspect. - Okay. Okay, well, this is the situation here. Jake is going to be going to make the call. Ashley told me that he's going to be using a payphone at an LRT station. I don't know if this is possible, but can you have police waiting at each one? - Of course, I'm on it. - All right. Jake is going to be making the phone call any minute now. He is the one that you really need to get. So just play along and pretend you're my dad. - You got it. It's all coming together, Melody. It's almost over. - You bitch! - I have to go, okay? - Uh-oh. - Are you fucking kidding me? You and Devin have known each other this whole fucking time? - What? No. I told you. We only saw each other at a party. I don't actually know him. - Well, I just checked his laptop and between the messages and the pictures, it seems like you two know each other pretty fucking well. - I don't even know what you're talking about. - Don't even try, you lying fucking bitch. Devin is mine. You're cheating with him behind Jake's back. I loved him. I had plans with him. I didn't know he was fucking you on the side. - I'm not fucking him. I don't even know him. I don't know any of you guys until you brought me here. - I knew I shouldn't have trusted you. Everyone fucks me over. And I thought you were different. - I am different. - Well, the deal's off. Jake can kill you for all I care, and I'll still get my share of the money. - Fuck! - Well, you really blew that one. - Quiet so we don't wake my dad. Text me tomorrow, okay? I want to see you again. - Yeah, for sure. - What? - Melody, Detective Goldsmith. - Hey. Look, things are just really, really messed up here. - Melody, I want you to be honest with me. Did you know Devin Harvey before today? - No! I told you, I only recognized him from that picture I sent you, remember? Whatever he's telling you is a lie. Why don't you believe me? It's impossible. - Hold on, Melody. Your friend, Tammy just sent me the picture from that party I requested. Give me a sec to look through them. Huh, that one with you in the back of the car is interesting. - It's impossible. - Melody, where's your father? - What? I told you that he's dead. - There's no record of his death, Melody. In fact, everyone seems to be worried that he's missing. He didn't show up at work yesterday and nobody can reach him. - Of course they can't fucking reach him. He's dead. What do you expect? What kind of a detective are you? - How'd he die, Melody? - I don't know. - Melody. - He hit me first! - Melody, what did you do to your father? - How did I die, Melody? - Melody. Melody, you still there? - I don't want to talk about my dad right now. - That's fine, Melody. We got an address from Devin. - He told you where I am? - Not exactly. We checked up the address on his driver's license. It turns out it's the same address as a Jake Harvey. We're on our way. - Okay, just please hurry. I just lost my only friend here. - We're coming. Give us 10 minutes. - You better hope they get here before Ashley gets her gun and shoots you herself. - She won't. They need me alive until they get their money. - You sure about that? She might panic when she hears the cops rolling up. - No, this is gonna work. - Melody, why can't you just admit it? You're lying about everything. - No, I'm not. - Yes, you are. - No, I'm not. - Yes. - No. - Yes. - No. - You're talking to a figment of your imagination. What does that tell you? - If you're a figment of my imagination, then it means I shouldn't listen to you. - You know why you're here. You know what you did. - I swear I don't. - You've blocked it all out. Just think. - 30 seconds, Melody. We're going to storm the house and rescue you. - Okay, just be careful. Ashley's upstairs and she's armed. - So are we. Get down on the ground, we're coming in. Stay on the line. - Okay. - What are you doing? - He told me to get down. - In case bullets start flying? - Yes, just get down. - You're actually worried about me? - Yes, just- - Go, go, go. - Let's move. - Melody, we're in. - I think I hear you. - Where are you? Can you call out? - I'm downstairs in the basement, but Ashley's still up there. Have you found her? - Hold on, Melody, be quiet. Don't say anything. Melody, this house doesn't have a basement. We're in the wrong house. - Jake. - It's all over, Melody. Your dad didn't answer. - What? No, that's impossible. - It's the way it is. I guess this is the end of the line for you. - Melody. - What happened? You were supposed to pick up the phone. You were supposed to stall him longer so you could find me. And then you go to the wrong fucking house. Oh my god, you just killed me. - Melody, it's time to stop playing games. Devin told me everything. - What did he tell you? - He told me all about you two and your plan. - What plan? - This is crazy. I don't want to go to prison. - You won't. I have it all planned out. - How do we know your dad's not just going to call the cops once he thinks you're kidnapped? - I'm his fucking precious. Trust me. He won't do anything that'll get me killed. Hey, all you have to do is call and read what I wrote for you. I will take care of everything else. Just meet me at the park at seven, okay? We'll hide and my dad will drop off the money, and we'll take it. $1 million in cash, Devin. Half of it's yours. - All right, let's do it. - I don't even know him. Every single thing that he has said to you is a lie. - I didn't get to where I was being a bad detective, Melody. I know the truth from a lie. Melody, where are you? - No, no, okay? Fuck you, all right? I don't need you. You were the one person who was supposed to believe in me. I'm going to figure this out on my own. I don't need any of you. Where are you? I bet you're just laughing at me now. - Get ready, Melody, you lying bitch. Jake's out bank digging a hole. I'm going to watch him shoot you. - Ashley, I'm sorry. Can you- - Too late now. - Melody, phone. - I don't really feel like talking to you right now. - We found the house, Melody. We're on our way. It was registered under Jake Harvey's girlfriend's name, Ashley Collins. - What? Okay, just hurry please. They said that they're digging me a grave and they're going to kill me any second. - Regardless of what you did, Melody, I'm still going to save you. - Okay, okay, that's all I want. I just want to go home. Thank you. What the fuck? Hello. - You've had your phone this whole time? - Yeah. - And your dad's dead? - Yes. - I can't believe you fucked me over like this. - What are you talking about? And how did you get my number? Did Zak or Tammy give it to you? - What the fuck is wrong with you? We should have just stuck with the plan. - You're pretending like you know me. Are the cops listening to you? - They're not listening. They let me go. They believed my story. I was going to go get the money and then come back for you. But since you killed your dad, I guess that's not happening. - Listen, Devin, we can- - No, you listen to me, Melody? I'm coming back to the house and I got to decide whether or not I'm going to blow your fucking brains out. The only way you're getting out of that room is if you. - Fuck. - Where were you? How long does it take to dig a grave? - I had to dig up my money too. And I dug two graves. - Jake. - Time to die. Fuck you. - Jake, Devin, or Detective Goldsmith? You got a 50-50 chance. - That's not 50-50. - You know it can't be Goldsmith. - Hello? Hey, are you there yet? Okay, I'll be right there. Just stick to the plan and everything will work out, okay? You're not locking me up. - It's not jail, Melody. - It's a fucking mental institution. - Yeah, they can help you. Don't you want to get better? - There's not wrong with me. - Yes, there is. You're coming with me whether you want to or not.
