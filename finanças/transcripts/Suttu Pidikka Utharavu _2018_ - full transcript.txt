This is Hasini's house. That child's house? In Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, the terrorists have planned for a major attack. In Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, the terrorists have planned for a major attack. Brother. Somehow, I escaped from the Police. We had three patterns, Why can't we trigger the bomb? That's what, I don't know. It's perplexing. My guy is well talented. Kumar, - yes. We'll be back. Let's discuss with others and find a good solution. Right? Mubarak! In Mumbai and Rayalaseema, the bomb exploded at the right time. Five hundred people from the public, the school children, Those who were doing prayers, everyone is dead. But, what happened here? We're trying. It's becoming very difficult. Hakeem was inside the car where the bomb was kept. What happened to him? He made that ready and came out. But, he didn't come here. But, he didn't come here. Call the Sharma couple. I tried, couldn't get the line. In bomb blast in Rayalaseema, Andhra, 330 people died and more than 50 people are injured. In the gun fire between the terrorists and the Policemen... We must decide, what to do next? Somehow, we must cheat the Police, take the car out, And blast the bomb in 10 minutes. How to blast the bomb? The problems are mounting up because of the bank robbers. What happened? What happened? Some problem in the set up. It's not working. Did you activate the automatic network modulator? Try to overwrite using the proxy network. That too isn't working. My stomach has bulged due to the lunch that I had. Is that Policeman standing there only? For the past two hours he is standing there only. We know that. If our sister goes and tells wrong about uncle. Mistaking for everything. Who are you? Did you come to buy chappati? You're the boss for all these people. In mixing the dough. In North India, even the Parotta maker looks like a model. What, dear? Hey, the burglar who threatened the cops, abducting Hasini? He is also going into Hasini's house. Something interesting is going to happen. Hey, look the car is shaking. Yes. It seems someone is inside. We'll look in a closer range. Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! What happened? The helicopter has fallen down and it broke. Then my phone bought by Kuttima with love? Sorry sir.

Kuberan, don't believe him. Sir, I'll give you the money, I have. He is trying to change by giving money. - Sir, I'll give you the money. Please sir... Take the shot. Listen to me, don't believe him. Brother, please wait. Just a minute... He is trying to bribe you. Why that Policeman took a selfie standing here? Brother, the Police has come to catch us. Selva, take the shot. Thank god. What happened, Ibrahim? It's done, sir. It's done, sir. You've done a good job. Master plan! - Thank you sir. - What. Is it a plan? The Police has arrived. The Police are firing at us. Run. Run fast. Hey, Police. Take the weapons. Come fast. Shoot the police. A report came from IB in the morning, sir. The Police Commissioners of the three states spoke to me. Particularly, Mumbai and Chittoor city Commissioners spoke to me. They told me their decision to alert the people in that locale... and do a stint operation. I disagreed with that Idea. Because, if we do that operation, There will be loss of lives on both the sides. Alert the people also here, sir. I've a different stratagem, sir. Ashok, the best bomb defuser in our department. Because of some issues, he has taken 6 months leave. I called him and asked for help. I convinced him saying Ashok's batch mate Selva... is ready for this operation. We need a dog for this plan to defuse the bomb. So, we employed the dog, Dupy. We started our scouting. Four people are new to that house, isn't it? No sir, they've come for a function. A car is standing near the tank for past 2 days what about that? I've checked it. No doubt, sir. What about the Nigerian's stay in that house? I went there, they didn't allow us inside. Ashok, we must find the vehicle where the bomb is placed. We must find out the terrorists place. Yes, sir. We've to wait till we defuse the bomb. Okay, sir. Only then is the operation. - It's my order. - Okay, sir. - Who are you? - What mam? That house is locked. What are you doing there? We're searching for a vacant house. Are you searching for the house on the terrace? Three people are standing on the terrace of Anbu's house. Three people are standing on the terrace of Anbu's house. We created a scene that a robbery is going to happen in the Access bank. We convinced that manager, went inside and spoke to... all the clients and panicked them. Ashok and Selva team visited the bank and changed the securities. And made the police to stay there in mufti. We narrowed our search to six houses. As per the IB report we got, Six terrorists are staying in RS Puram and they're setting up one car bomb. But, we don't know about the car and the house. We've to buy the time. We came to know that the two terrorists... are staying separately in a house. We encountered both the terrorists. The police dog smelled the bomb in the vehicle. Sir, Dupy has found the vehicle with the bomb. A blue colour van. A blue colour van. Kuberan identified a terrorist in a house. We came to know that those two people in the photo... was there in the Mumbai attack. Sniper sir. See here. A partially blind person is in the upstairs. He is blind. Mic C 2. One of the terrorist has activated the bomb in the vehicle. So, we're forced to shoot him. Take a shot. To defuse the bomb in the vehicle, We made the officer Ashok, to come near to the vehicle. We did a mock shoot on him with the snipers. We did a mock shoot on him with the snipers. He defused the bomb in the van, as if he fell down dead. What about the blood that oozed out from Ashok, on shooting? That's the artificial blood. Am I right? You found it, sir. To explode that bomb, they've used three different methods. Signal activator, liquid detonation and the timer. But, we couldn't defuse the bomb within the planned time. Sir, it's very complicated. They've connected it to the signal activator. Sir, we've sent the child inside. We created a drama by kidnapping the house owner's child... where the terrorists were staying. By utilising that time, I can't defuse it. What happened? Hurry up. Hurry up. Just wait. Don't leave the child. Once the bomb was defused, We decided to shoot all the terrorists. We got an information that one of the terrorist is roaming out. I must go urgently, sir. The terrorist who couldn't enter RS puram, Bribed the policeman and came inside. It's our plan asking the policeman to accept the bribe. Hey police, you came to our place and cheat us. Hey, I'll kill... I won't leave you. I'll kill you. One more. Hey, get up. Get up. Hey Police, Go back. Go. Go back. Go. Go. Don't come near me. I'll kill you. I'll kill him. Go back. Go. Ashok, Selva don't worry about my life. It's okay, if Kuberan gets killed. This operation must be successful. Kill all these people. Drop your rifles. Don't worry about me. Drop your rifles. Do what I say. Tell them to drop the rifles down. Hey... Hold. I'll shoot him. I'll shoot him. Shoot him. Ask him to drop the rifle down. Ask him to drop the rifle down. Drop it. Else, I'll kill him. - Down... - I'll explode his head. Fast. Hurry up... hurry up... Ask the army men, to drop the rifles down. Ashok, do what I say. In all the buildings. Hurry, drop the rifles down. Shoot him. Don't drop the rifle. Drop the rifle down. Hey Police, by disguising as thieves, You've cheated us. Do it. I'll die only after killing 10 people. Hurry up. Else, I'll kill him. This is what happened sir. Oh, everything is a plan then? Then, it's a plan that your hand is hurt. Why are you still having that bandage on your hand? Untie it. Sir, got the reports. There is a tiny crack. So, don't move your hand. This is not a plan, sir. It's a real injury. In Mumbai and Andhra Pradesh, They had attacked the terrorists directly and killed them. But, why do you need such a drama? In the Mumbai operation you mentioned, 250 civilians have died. In Andhra Pradesh, 55 school children and 36 people in the mosque were died. In our operation, not even a single civilian is dead. If known earlier, I too would've helped you in this operation. No, sir. You wouldn't have helped us, sir. Sorry, sir. No secret stays with you. Sorry, sir. No secret stays with you. How dare you! Stop it. If we want to question him, We can keep questioning for the whole day. We can have an inquiry on him. We can even suspend him. But, he had finished this operation successfully. The only respect we can show him is... Sir. Hey, lift. Sorry. Sir, slowly. Have you come to make rotis? Bastards. Okay. Okay. Dear, have I tortured you a lot? Thank you for your cooperation. Good girl. Do you like this aunty very much? Really. Very good. How happy is she, sir. To take care of your daughter, you won't get a better mother than her. Sir. Talk to her. Marry her. Bye.
