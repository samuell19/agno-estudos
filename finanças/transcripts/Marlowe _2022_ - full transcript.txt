War continues in Europe. Hitler has suggested that any questions over the future of Poland will be settled entirely between Germany and Russia. He also stated that he regards the Czechoslovak Question as closed. Speaking at Washington, President Roosevelt made no comment as to... The name's Cavendish. A Miss Cavendish. Perhaps it's a first name, Cavendish? Um, cigarette? The cigarettes you keep for your clients, are they better or worse than what you smoke? They're the same. Perhaps it is a first name, Cavendish. It's... a good first name. Mm. Please. How private exactly are your investigations, Mr. Marlowe? What can I do for you, Mrs. Cavendish? Mm, you are a detective. I'd like you to find someone for me. Mm-hmm. Nico Peterson. He was my lover, he disappeared without saying goodbye. When you say disappeared, do you mean out of your life or out of the world? I don't know, that's why I'm here. Where was your husband, Mrs. Cavendish, when your lover Nico Peterson disappeared? In retrospect... do call me Cavendish without the Missus. I like it. Was your lover the sort of man to disappear with you as a lover? Normally, they don't disappear easily. No, I bet they don't. They stay around, climb trellises, scenes in restaurants, lie down in the road, promise you anything. Oh, I know how it goes. Do you lie down in the road, Mr. Marlowe? - Drink? - Please. Well, he's tall, like you. Bit of a weaker man. He dresses nice, meticulously. What does that say about a man? Does Mr. Peterson get money from his profession or does he just profess his profession? You seem to assume that I was involved with someone unsuitable. Yes, unless you were unsuitable for him. Go to hell, you pathetic little... Would it be accurate to say that Mr. Peterson would be a marginal person in motion pictures? - Apologies, sir. - Yes. Alright. It would be accurate, it would be very accurate indeed. Go to hell, you pathetic... We would meet at the Corbata Club. Do you know it? How did Mr. Peterson know the Corbata Club? Was he your guest or the kind of guy who was anybody's guest? My husband and I have an arrangement. May I ask, is your husband homosexual? No. He isn't remotely that interesting. He likes polo, alcohol, waitresses and my money. Your money, Mrs. Cavendish? I beg your pardon, Mr. Marlowe. I'm asking if the money is yours. My father was in oil, he's dead. You'd know my mother, but we won't discuss her now. Did you conduct your affair with Mr. Peterson at the club? We weren't meeting in the horse sheds, Mr. Marlowe. What did he not show up for? An assignation. I telephoned him a few times, no answer, and then I went to his house the following week. The milk hadn't been canceled and the newspapers were piled up on his porch. Did he have things to hide? Haven't we all? What do you think has become of Mr. Peterson? Told you, I want a set of fresh eyes and yours come highly recommended. Maybe you'll find out what I can't. My name's really Clare, like the county. You know the county? Yeah, in Ireland. I know it well. My mother was in pictures, you'd know her. It's rather embarrassing with the upper class. You're very perceptive and sensitive, Mr. Marlowe. I imagine it gives you trouble. He ain't home, bo. What? He owe you dough or make time with your wife? That's the way it is, huh? Yeah, I'd say so, and good for him. He's not a bad guy, if you don't trust people anyway. I don't. I think he's from Cleveland. That's my place across the street, he used to come over sometimes, pass the time of day. Give me a smoke. How, uh, how long has he been gone? Oh, I guess I last seen him seven weeks ago. You, uh, you see him leave? No, I just noticed he was gone. How did you know? Well, he wasn't there anymore. That means there weren't any women banging on his front door, or throwing a shoe at the house. I mean, I did pretty good in my day, but not like him. Are you a cop? Sort of. A private dick ain't no cop. Yeah, you're not the first one to come around asking about him. A pair of wetbacks showed up last week, and they was all gussied up, but a beaner in a suit and fancy necktie, it's still a beaner, right? No, sometimes he's the King of Spain. King of Spain don't ride around in no Lincoln, with a Mexican re-spray. Yeah, I used to work in the low end of the motor trade myself, it was two beaners in a hot car that had been across the border and back. Oh, let's start at the beginning. This guy's been looked at, sure. Grifts, alienations of affection, parking tickets, drunk at a social gathering. And in the early days, public solicitation. Now nobody knew he ever had a house, he's down as domicile unknown. He does have a house, I was there. Yeah, well, there's having a house and being the person paying for it, I suppose. Who was paying for it? Well, I think you'll find he was paying cash from his no visible means of support. Hope the lady friend looking for him looks good in black. He was killed. October 22nd, hit and run. Outside the Corbata Club. You owe me lunch. Liquid or regular? "Deceased was struck by a vehicle, make unknown, driver unknown, on Bay Canyon Drive just outside the Corbata Club. Deceased has numerous injuries including gross comminuted fracture right side of his skull. Death be not proud." I guess there's no point in asking for an invite. Oh, none at all, sir. Uh-huh. Oh, hey! You looking for a gardening job? Actually, no, a membership form. Albert. We've got a hedge hopper here. He needs trimming. A ver. - Hey, buddy. - A ver. Maybe there's a reason you're unpopular with policemen. Keep getting, I don't know... punched, locked up, and almost, but not quite, charged with accessory, obstruction, etcetera. - And at your age. - It's my manner, Joe. Yup, starting to wish you still had your pension? Sure you are. Look, Marlowe, listen... This guy got killed after getting sauced in there. The remains smelled like a brewery, and he had marks up and down his arms, his head popped like a pumpkin. The Corbata Club likes to make it nice, it does not like trouble. Hit and run is two crimes at least. Don't fuck with me, this is LA. These guys like Peterson are a dime a dozen, they come out here, they fail a screen test and they do what they've to do. Could any member of the Corbata Club not know that he was dead? From our own Chief of Detectives to the new Ambassador to England, I find it highly unlikely it didn't come up over cream tea that a scumbag had caught a Buick at the front entrance. Did they ask you to broom the case? No one has to ask, my brother. Can I see the police file? We don't need it. Why you looking for this guy? A lady wanted to find him. Well, he'll wait until she comes by. Go back to Boston, to that miserable goddamn family. And then onto England, the court of Saint fucking James. You're not the only one who's done with this. Just remember one thing. Oh, please, darling, not another. I paid for that horse. I get to keep him too. Could you, uh, do mine after? Are you the new mechanic? Maybe, what's it paying? - You've a name? - Marlowe. This is hell nor am I out of it. That was his one good line. You don't think he was Shakespeare. Neither did he. Maybe I am out of it. Well out of it. You startled me, Marlowe. Apologies, seems to be my day for startling. Who else did you startle? Some elegant Mick outside, who quoted Marlowe. Are you quotable, Mr. Marlowe? Christopher Marlowe. Ah, he played in Doctor Faustus at the Harvard Rep. Never lets anyone forget that. - He? - Hm. Joseph O'Reilly, my mother's financial adviser, oh, and soon to be Ambassador to England, he never lets anyone forget about that either. What did he play, one of the seven deadly sins? Please. Iced tea? You could have some of mine if you like. No, thank you. I can offer you anything really, it's like the Arabian Nights around here. Clare! Clare! Who the hell is this? Sorry, I'm, I'm Philip Marlowe. Hello, Marlowe. Cavendish. Mr. Marlowe calls me Cavendish, Richard. I like it. It's your name, darling. I like it as a first name. Glad I'm good for something, dear. Have you, um, offered your very large friend a proper drink, darling? She did, and I declined, thank you. So, Mr. Marlowe, what kind of business are you in? Mr. Marlowe detects things. Ah, and what are you detecting here, Marlowe? My necklace. I lost it, he found it. Of course he did. I wonder where. Well, it was a matter of retracing your wife's steps. - Marlowe. - Yes, Mr. Cavendish. Fuck yourself. It's a pleasure to meet you too, Mr. Cavendish. Didn't go for it, that's odd. He must think there's something between us... probably something... sexual. So tell me about you and Mr. Peterson with no embellishments, please. I met him at the Corbata Club for the first time. Thought he was handsome. We made love, and then I saw him again, a few weeks later, not an assignation, an accident. In Tijuana at my favorite bar, La Quinteria. I was there with my husband. We were watching the procession, Dia de los Muertos. What was he hustling in Mexico? I don't know. Nico has many schemes. He's in the grave. Nico Peterson is dead. He's pretending. He's pretending very well. Oh, I know, he's dead and buried. That he got killed in front of the Corbata Club, supposedly. Everybody says he was. But you see, the significant thing is that I saw him the other day, from the street, not in my mind's eye, on the street, not dead at all. I think we're finished, Mrs. Cavendish. No. I just wanted you to start at the beginning. Begin at the beginning, that's what you're supposed to do, right? - Where did you see him? - Back in Tijuana. My mother wanted me to view some Azteca horses, you know the prancing kind. I did that, I do what she says. So I was in La Quinteria again, having one of their divine mojitos when I saw Nico driving down the street. He called himself a collector. Most of all collected junk, pretend antiques. I suppose they're for the movies... things that don't exist, fairy tales. There's a man in Baja, who thinks Nico's actually a producer. He's been fleeced. What? What's wrong? You lied to me, Mrs. Cavendish. And I sat there and watched you lie to your husband. Good afternoon. Hello, Mr... Marlowe. Oh, of course, I knew that. Richard made a call when you first came in. You know what they say about the old boys' club? What's that? There really is one. And what did he find, Madame, uh... Dorothy Quincannon, and don't pretend you don't know. Well, let's see, you had a bad war, and then in the twenties, you drank yourself out of a good job in the oil business. Did I? Got on with the Los Angeles DA as an investigator, but that didn't work out too well either, did it, Mr. Marlowe? You see, he found all that out in five minutes. You're not the only one who can make enquiries. You weren't looking for pearls. No, I throw them before swine, it's a habit of mine. Tell me, Mr. Marlowe, what does my daughter want? A divorce? I might even approve. I'm sorry, I only discuss business with my employer, so if you'll excuse me. - Slan. - Slan. Excuse me? - Hey, Fergus. - Oh, hello. Ah, Jesus, here it is. Not a single lead on who ran Peterson down. - We pursued inquiries. - But how far? Marlowe, if one wanted to find an absolute nest of entitled and connected tosspots who feel they can just drive away after running over another drunk's head, you go to the Corbata Club. There were no witnesses, a suspect wasn't possible. Saturday night, they come and go at that club like rats through a hole in a garbage can. It could have been any one of a hundred cars that flattened him, and probably none of them contained anybody it'd be wise to arrest. We're in the real world here. You understand a real world. Sometimes justice is blind, sometimes justice doesn't give a shit and might be right. So who's the mystery broad you're working for? His sister? Tell me about his sister. Maybe she identified him, maybe she didn't. You tell me about his sister. I got my own sister, you can stick his sister up your ass. I'm working for a person who thinks that Nico Peterson is still alive. Yeah, that's complicated. I'm not a complicated man. My client claims to have seen him, which gives you a murder, my friend. Yeah, I got plenty, thanks. Here's your file. My employer thinks he didn't die, that it wasn't him that got smashed outside the Corbata Club, to repeat myself. It gives me a murder, yeah, theoretically, maybe. What's your trouble gents? Money or women? Both, with the complication of thirst. He's like the rest of us, Pat, except he can't take a hint. - What'll you have? - Whiskey. Usual. What's going on these days Patrick, you, you married, or happy? At least my laundry's done. Pat had a rough two weeks finding clean drawers after he lost his mother. Fuck yourself. If I could, I wouldn't have to listen. If it was an operation, I'd sign up. If he's alive, Joe, you have a homicide. Gonna keep saying that? That's the last thing you want in homicide, I realize, homicide. What, you think it was a homicide? I went to the graveyard. Guess what? - He was cremated. - Good guess. Yeah, even the teeth were destroyed and they'd be everywhere. You ever run over a rat or a cat, look at it? If Peterson didn't die, who did? Look, Marlowe, I know you got this Sir Lancelot bullshit, and you live like some monk, you got no regular self-interest anyone can count on, you like getting sapped and locked up for just not stopping, and this is an interesting story you have, if true. But that stiff, Peterson, for all intents and purposes, had Peterson's wallet in his pocket. Plus, he was identified at the scene, for all intents and purposes. By who? The manager of the club, Floyd Hanson, and by the Los Angeles County Coroner, who's a member. So, it's nobody's business now but county. County line runs where? Bay Canyon Drive. Right along here? Oh, Jesus. Make the call, Joe. I'll keep you out of it. Mr. Hanson says it's most irregular, Mr. Marlowe, but he'll see you. Keep to the left, follow the signs that say reception. Oh, thank you. I'm Floyd Hanson the manager. What can I do for you, Mr. Marlowe? Don't bother turning off the car. The gateman tells me you're a private investigator, could that be so? Yes, I used to work for the DA's office. - I've heard that. - I've heard that you've heard. I'm here about an accident that occurred. - A serious one? - Nico Peterson. Well, that actually wasn't on the property, that was more in the public road. Oh, I fully appreciate the distinction, but sometimes people get moved off the property even though their leg is lying on it a little bit. There was an interesting case in Cincinnati. What was that? A man was beaten to death, and then he was put in the road, and his head was run over by a tire, to obliterate the cause of death and to get him off the property. Mr. Peterson was run down on the road, and the road is not on the property. I appreciate that. Was Peterson a member of this club? No, Mr. Peterson wasn't a member. No. That's because you're exclusive I imagine. We are, but your meaning, sir? What would we do without Mexico? Mexico's the future, we have a sister club in Baja, California. - Looks like the past. - It must be brought along. Mexico or its inhabitants? Stick to the point, Mr. Marlowe. It must have been a shock for you, seeing Mr. Peterson on the road like that. I was at Chateau Thierry, old man, Belleau Wood. I have seen men in more disarray than that in which Mr. Peterson was discovered. Once, after an artillery strike, I found a friend's tooth in my whiskey glass. I drank the whiskey. You're a terrible man. He was dead, and I needed the whiskey. You're my age, perhaps you were there, perhaps you know how it was, and therefore is. Royal Irish Rifles. The Somme. For the rest of time, we see the dead. Let's take a stroll, Mr. Marlowe. We're alive, when others are not, and it's a pleasant morning. I see you've made inequity pretty much your profession. The Club is exclusive. The rich like to play. The polo grounds are over there. So whose guest was Mr. Peterson the night he was killed? Who's your employer Mr. Marlowe? We're at an impasse, Mr. Hanson. Who's yours? I don't know what you want me to tell you, the police were thorough, aren't they always, isn't that what they do, be thorough? I rarely blame a policeman unless he's really bad. There's generally someone he's afraid of. And who in this instance would any policeman be afraid of? Well, if the hit and run driver were a very substantial or a connected person, a policeman might be afraid of the Club in general. I mean, I am. What would it take for you not to be afraid? What can I do? Now, listen, Mr. Hanson, I intend to ask questions. Then ask your damn questions. Now this was a hit and run, and given the road, it was probably a member, and perhaps the driver didn't even know he'd struck anything. Everybody in this country has been drunk since its inception. I don't think I've ever even seen a sober driver. Shall we have some tea? Is there much gambling here, Mr. Hanson? You're on very dangerous ground. There are cards that are played. Debts accumulated. There are card rooms, they're private. Bedrooms? We have guest accommodations. Do studio men and the producers have meetings here? Why am I talking to you? Because you don't know who hired me. Well, name the thing that most intrigues you, perhaps we could conclude our chat. There is the possibility that the dead man was not Nico Peterson. His sister was shown his corpse the next day at the morgue and expressed no doubts. Where could I find his sister? Ask the police. Why do you raise the possibility that Peterson is alive, when I so clearly saw him dead? Someone may have seen him recently in the street. And where was this, uh, supposedly? I can't tell you. Goodbye, Mr. Marlowe. I'm sorry that it was ultimately uninteresting to talk to you. Ah, but I do like this thing that you have about not being afraid, when you should be. I'll see myself out. ♪ Sometimes it seems ♪ ♪ A part of the sin... ♪ You're the most beautiful woman in town. A star. ♪ Sometimes it seems ♪ My, my! You're not a regular. Well, not yet anyway. They do like to keep it exclusive. Yeah, it seems that way. Try me at the Cabana, Venice Beach. Excuse me? Try me at the Cabana, Venice Beach. Ask for Lynn, Lynn Peterson. - You're Nico's sister. - Sir? Gentlemen. ♪ Learn to play ♪ Lynn, I'm not sure if it's an N, or an E. With an X if she works here. There you go.

Oh, I'm, uh, I'm sorry to hear that. Is that, uh, Lynn with an X? Ah, fuck it. I'm getting too old for this. Are you keeping evil company? More often than not. Well, then, you'd better be a good boy, because you're going to meet Dorothy Quincannon at The Garden of Allah Hotel at 3:00. That's in 20 minutes. Dorothy Quincannon. Did you come for the film stars, Hilda? I came to bloody be one. Huh. First of all, you have to boil the water, now is that water boiled? - Yes, ma'am. - And then scald the teapot. - Give it a good scalding. - Alright. Put in one teaspoon per cup, then one for the pot and then leave it to draw for three minutes. Think of a soft boiled egg, darling, three minutes, no more, no less and then you're ready to pour, have you got that? Y... yes, ma'am. When you make tea, make tea. When you make water, make water. Water. I... I don't think he got it. Did you? You lifted it from Joyce, ma'am. Uh-ho, and he lifted it from somewhere else, shitty little man that he is. Never a day's work in his life. Yeah, apart from the books. Terrible little syphilitic. Tricked an American, sometimes that's all you have to do. Is that what you did? I've tricked any number of Americans, including playing pagan princesses, Elizabeth of England, ruined widows and any number of flash-eyed barefoot peasant girls. There's nothing to it, all you need are regular features and the ability to read. Oh, I very much doubt that. I spoke with my daughter. Surprisingly, she's not at all interested in getting a divorce. - She loves her husband. - No. But the arrangement suits her. Alcohol, waitresses and her money. My money. She hired you to find another swine, didn't she? Nico Peterson, who doesn't want to be found. You learned all of this from her, yeah? Ah! I want that tea strong enough to trot a mouse on. Fine, done, you can go now, I will be mother. Thank you, ma'am. I have also had the pleasure of Mr. Peterson's company, he was proposing certain investments. In the equitation business, I presume. Whatever business, I wasn't interested. But my daughter cannot help but want what she presumes I have. And you had Mr. Peterson? That was a presumption, Mr. Marlowe. An understandable one. I'm sure my daughter's paying you handsomely. I can't talk to you about your daughter's business. What business do you think there is in my family that isn't mine? If she thought I wanted you, she'd have you too. Mm. Perhaps she already has. I can only say it again, I'm not in a position to discuss your daughter's business with you. You're a proud stubborn man, Mr. Marlowe. I'm just an ordinary Joe trying to earn a buck and stay out of jail. Clare's father drove his car off a cliff in La Jolla before she was even born. He was in the oil business, very successful, but he couldn't hide from the black dog. It's the one thing that frightens me, Mr. Marlowe. That hound, it runs in families. You're afraid she's unstable? Oh, I know she is. So be careful, Mr. Marlowe, she has this burning need for a father figure. You see, I had to pretend that she was my niece all those years. My advisers thought that, uh, a daughter... would age me. What advisers? You've met the soon to be Ambassador to England. Mr. O'Reilly. And maybe he advised me wrongly, but I had to listen all those years. He even bought a studio, said it was to advance my career, but it did no harm to his bank balance. So, my daughter had to be my niece... until at last even I had to face the fact. The fact? That my game was up, it had been for some time. No more barefoot colleens, no more Ruritanian queens. I have more money than the Queen of Sheba, and I'm a very, very, very happy has-been. You mean a celluloid legend, surely. The key to Hollywood, Mr. Marlowe, is knowing when your game is up. Take the money and run, or stay, if you want. But at least take the money. I had another investigator on Mr. Peterson's case, a shamus, called Seamus, if you can believe. What did he find? That besides being prop master at Pacific Pictures, Nico was also a wannabe agent with the client of one, Miss Amanda Toxteth. So you see, Mr. Marlowe, my daughter wasn't the only one spreading her legs for him. So, if you find Mr. Peterson, come to me before... Where would I find Miss Toxteth? Don't know, some god-awful B picture I suppose. - Ma'am. - Wait. How dare you? I'm a little confused, I've already been paid. Cut! Cut! Cut! I need to see the face, the face, I need to see the face. Ama... Amanda, uh, camera's over there, I need you to look at the camera. Car rolls up, you look at the cameras, okay? Thank you. Lunch. I can take this off, right? Yes. After lunch. Believe me, I look better without the war paint. Thanks for seeing me, Miss Toxteth. Call me Mandy. You're a detective? I'm more harmless than I look. That must be exciting, being a detective. I can hardly contain myself. Oh, well, don't contain yourself on my account. Nico Peterson was your agent, yes? Well, he got me some work... "Riders of the Red Dawn," did you see it? - Mm, not yet, no. - Well, it's gone now. Joel McCrea was supposed to be in it, but something happened. I play the rancher's wife, who makes eyes at an Indian, and the Indian gets hanged. I'll catch it when it comes round again. Acting seems to be going well, Miss Toxteth. You're sweet. Actually, my mother says I should fuck more producers. What do you think? I think your mother is gravely mistaken. What can you tell me about Nico Peterson? How deeply should my account be detailed? Well, when did you last see him? I guess a week before he died. He was trying to get back into my good graces. - He was a womanizer, yes? - That's a tricky question. Nico liked the conquest, not the women. He'd hardly touch you after he'd had you. That's a particular kind of man. Some girls say handsome men are cold, that's normally just what you say to ugly men to make them feel better, but... Nico was cold. Nico had girlfriends, but he didn't have girls who were friends. Do you know any of his other girlfriends? Clare Quincannon supposedly fell for him. The blonde with the terrible mother. And the mother's story, kept by the Ambassador. He even bought this studio for her. I hear it's pure slavery. Did Nico have anything to do with Mexico, business out of Mexico? There's only one business out of Mexico, don't be a sweet chump. When he had money that was why, and probably the only reason anybody would look for him, owed money or a fix. What did he drive, Mister? - Who? - Nico Peterson. Well, whatever he drove, he ain't parking it here. You again? It's alright, I'm a friend of Nico's. - Philip Marlowe. - You're much too persistent. - I'm trying to find Nico. - He's dead. Wait a minute. Are you so sure of that? I've been hired to look into your brother's disappearance. He hasn't disappeared, he's in a jar on a marble shelf. I had to buy it myself. You saw it, too, should have known. What if I told you he might be alive? I don't believe in fairy tales, mister. I saw his body on the gurney at the place. So it wasn't at the club on the roadway. I did everything I had to. It couldn't have been easy seeing him. Wasn't much fun. And what's Floyd got against you? Why I wanted to meet, and if you're afraid of him or anything, we have to talk. I'm not afraid of anything. - What's in the book? - Words. No dope? Just words, it's a book about words. - Nico was good with words. - You say you saw his body? Yeah. And then the cop tried to make me in the hallway. Probably has a daughter my age. It's funny, whatever you do, there is always someone trying to make ya. Mm-hmm. You know what, fuck Floyd, fuck cops and fuck you. I know the lady, she's the punk's sister, but who are you? You are a big one. I'm thinking of renting the place. Donde esta Serena? Who's Serena? If you know my brother, he probably dumped her. Where's Serena? - Who's Serena? - My brother is dead... Who's Serena? You take us to her or you'll see what happens. Please. Well, well, what have we got here? Boss wants a word. - And who might you be big guy? - Cedric, big guy. Your boss's name? Oh, he's a little guy, Lou Hendricks. Well, well... Get up. ♪ Down the ol' big sea wave ♪ ♪ I found a new baby ♪ ♪ A little baby ♪♪ The Lou Hendricks. Finally, I need no introduction. I'm a generic name, Cedric, an eponymous trademark. You're a criminal. Businessman and philanthropist. I could use a few bucks, take me away from all this. I was hoping you could use a few bucks, Mr. Marlowe, but alas, it will be transactional, not philanthropic. Well, what was the words you wanted? I can only hope it is not a past participle. Where's home, Mr. Marlowe? Where the heart is, but you know that. No, I mean your actual, quotidian home. 26, Maple Boulevard. Let's take Mr. Marlowe to his quotidian home, Cedric. The Elements of Style by William Strunk Jr. A participle phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject. Walking slowly down the road, he saw a woman accompanied by two children. If you give any trouble... he will drop you like a bad grammatical habit. Do you need to dress that? Cedric, your do-rag. You mean my pocket square, Mr. Hendricks? Some days, Cedric, I wish I'd left you where I found you. - Give me the goddam thing. - Thank you. I hear, Mr. Marlowe, and from various connections, that you are looking for someone. - We're all looking for someone. - Oh, that's very sad. Tell me who I'm looking for. Let me guess, two Mexes who are looking for a broad named Serena. Serena, a femme of the most delicate shape imaginable, last seen in the arms of one Nico Peterson. - Does that name ring a bell? - A tinkle. I don't need you to hear a tinkle, I need you to hear a sonorous bell with a hunchback swinging from it, gong-a-dong-a-dong, not a tinkle, Mr. Marlowe. Who was chasing Peterson's sister? Two beaners, I hear. Maladroits from sunnier climes, the land of banana and tarantula, who were also, quite separately, and I should like you to notice that, looking for her brother. I would very much appreciate a word with our friend Nico, if you find him and I will pay you. Tell me what Nico was involved in and why he faked his death and ran. Nico, in the end, had to avoid everybody, I think. But I will tell you that he used to run errands for me, down in the land of the sombrero, the serape and the mule. His Spanish was good, he was dark in a Latin lover kind of way. He was useful in Mexico. Is it bananas or tarantulas you import, Mr. Hendricks? Tarantulas. I'm entirely composed of tarantulas. - And me afraid of spiders. - Nico worked for me. He would bring me items so hard to come by up here where the law
