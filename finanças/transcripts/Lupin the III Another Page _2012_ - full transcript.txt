Genoa, Italy. Right there! Right there! Alright! Yeah! Y-you... Let's go! W-who's there! What are you doing here! Answer me! P-professor! You! Put your hands up and turn around!

LUPIN III - The Travels of Marco Polo - Another Page. So the legendary missing page of "The Travels of Marco Polo"... actually exists, Associate Professor Claudio? Y-yes. The now-deceased Professor Argento and I have found a lithograph in the prison ruins of Palazzo San Giorgio in Genoa, where Marco Polo was imprisoned for a time. The so-called "Another Page"? Yes, signed by Marco Polo himself. Associate Professor, what's written on the page? An afterword, some sort of message for his family. But... B-but while we were studying it in detail it was stolen by Lupin the Third! Not only that, but the prison ruins were destroyed and Professor Argento was m-murdered! Impossible! Lupin would never stoop to murder for such a reason! W-who are you? I'm from the ICPO, Inspector Zeniga- Hey, wait a minute! I wasn't finished! I'm from the ICPO! I said I'm Zenigata from the ICPO! Bastards! Do you treat everyone like garbage! Crap! They don't listen to the ICPO... And that Lupin... What's he up to this time? Yes, don't worry. Everyone thinks that Lupin the Third has stolen Another Page. And we now have... Yes. Yeah. We also found something rather interesting... Yeah. Another Page revealed that Marco Polo has a hidden legacy... Yes. You catch on fast, Duke! I will let you know once we get results. Yes. Goodbye. Greedy, senile old prick. Grandpa Theo... Why? Lisa? There you are, Lisa. I've been looking for you. I'm sorry, Professor Claudio. I didn't mean to worry you... No, I'm relieved. Ever since he passed away you've locked yourself in your room. I'm glad to see you're outside now. Thank you so much. And I'm sorry. Well... That is... I wasn't able to save him. Please don't say that. There was no one else that I could turn to... But I always feel encouraged around you. Lisa. Are you Lisa Argento? Yes, I am. I'm Zenigata from the ICPO. You're that man from earlier... Apologies for interrupting the press conference. Anyways, miss. I have some questions about the recent incident. W-wait a second! Lisa doesn't know anything! She was home alone at that time! Don't you know that Lupin's the primary suspect? Why are you bothering her? It wasn't Lupin! Sorry. Lupin is not a cold-blooded murderer despite what everyone thinks. What are you saying? He's a thief. If you look at his past history... Who the hell are you guys? I-it's Lupin! His gang's going after Lisa...! No! Anyways, leave them to me. Get out of here! R-right! Hold it! You gotta deal with me first! H-hey! You cowards! Lisa. Yes? I'll hold them off here. You'd better run. I can't! Not by myself... Doesn't matter, just run! Professor! Run, Lisa! But... There's no point in sacrificing yourself as well! Now hurry... Run! That's enough. You fought well, Professor. Er, not really... That Lupin... What's he up to this time? Lisa Argento, huh? Yeah. Theo Argento's granddaughter. Learning archeology in the same university as the old man. Huh... So somebody killed her grandfather and now she has no family. You're no saint either. Shut up! Stop picking on me and keep a lookout. That guy should be here any minute. Yeah, yeah. By the way, what's that book you've been reading? "Il Milione." "The Travels of Marco Polo", huh? Isn't that the book where Marco Polo went to Japan and loaded up on gold coins? It's a 13th century travelogue that Marco Polo wrote over a period of 24 years when he went to the Orient. More or less what I said. Well, that's not all there is to this book. Right, there's also Another Page. According to old man Theo's diary, Marco Polo has some sort of hidden legacy. Gold coins, I bet! I don't have any other information but if we track that guy's movements... He'll lead us right to the gold. Who is this guy anyways? I have no idea. Hey, hey, do you even know what you're doing? And what did you say about people disappearing? I don't know, must have been a weapon or maybe Marco Polo's curse. Hmph, whatever. I should have been keeping a lookout. Aw, don't be like that. Anyways, we should meet Lisa and hear her side of the story. Weird. I know what's going on here. Oh really? Where did you hear about Another Page in the first place? Uh, well... From Fujiko! Well, she said "I'd rather have Another..." Page than an engagement ring"... How did you know? H-hey, what's wrong, Jigen? I'm going home. But... Wait! I want nothing to do with that woman. Wait a minute, Jigen. There's a whole pile of gold waiting for us! That stupid... Fine! I'll do it myself! All by myself! You selfish, cold-blooded...! That's my buddy! I knew you'd come back... Idiot! Look behind me! Who are those guys! You think I know? It's Lupin! Lupin's trying to kill me! Huh...? Lisa Argento? And you are? Uh, well... I am Inspector Colonel of the ICPO and this is my subordinate, Detective Sanders. Subordinate! Then you two are friends of Mr. Zenigata? Uh... Yeah. He asked us to keep you safe. Hey, Sanders! Get to work! Hmph, I'm on it! Hey, hey, we're not finished here, Sanders. We're dealing with a tank. I'm gonna try some custom-made rounds. Damn it! Damn you, Lupin the Third... Like I said, you need deceit to beat him. You think you can take the girl away from Lupin? Of course I can. I know all about Lupin's behavior. Hey, are you okay? Are you injured? Why... Why is this happening? He never took a bath when I told him to... I told him not to waste food but he refused to eat peppers... I kept telling him to smoke outside but he always smoked in his room... He was always smiling... Just a while ago, everything was the same as it always was... Just a while ago, he was still alive... We can't change the past. It's hard, but we have to keep on with our lives. I know that! But I...! This is... Grandpa Theo's... Yep. Have a look. Read the last entry. "Another Page contains a secret." If it is ever revealed, it would corrupt... all mankind and wars would break out. Marco would not have wanted that. "Therefore, I must destroy Another Page!" If only we never found Another Page... Read the previous entry. "Someday." "Someday..." When Lisa becomes a brilliant archaeologist... together we will fulfill Marco's last wish. I will wait for that day to come. "Lisa..." Grandpa Theo... He thought it would be fun if you two... learned about Marco Polo together. I bet he wanted you to discover Marco Polo's secrets. Me? That's impossible... If that's what you think... If you look at past history, you rarely see women accomplish so much like Cleopatra or Joan of Arc. And I... I see. Professor! Can I answer this? Yeah. Hello, Professor? You're okay! Yes, I'm safe as well. Hey. You sure it's okay? I don't know. But we need to cheer her up somehow. I guess. You followed me? Professor Claudio! Wa-wa-wait! That's dangerous, Lisa! If those thugs find you... It's okay. The Professor brought a friend with him. Gah! It's pops! What do we do? How would I know? Get in! Fujiko! Fujicakes! My guardian angel! Um, who... It's okay, get in. But Professor Claudio... Don't worry, you'll meet him later! Now... Sorry, I'm in a bit of a rush. Bye bye. No way! Looks like your fiancee stabbed you in the back. Shut up! Women are more interesting when you don't know what to expect. Although I have a few surprises of my own. Anyways, we've got to find out who's behind all this... Crap, I forgot about him! You're under arrest, Lupin! Whoa, that's our cue! Come back here! Do not kill, and do not be killed. Profound words... The ultimate way of... the sword is to win without fighting. I, however, am distracted by trivial things. How immature. Hm? When did he...? Hm... 75 points. Noble samurai. Are you here on a pilgrimage? No, I... Pardon me, but is something on your mind? Or! Are you trying to take my apple? What? Just a joke. Sir, are you here to train as well? Training... Apples show strength without training. Because they do not thirst for blood. Bloodthirst... Come with me. Um... Is this really the ICPO? ICPO? You still don't know? You've been kidnapped. What? But Fujiko... Excellent. You lived up to your word. Thank you. I have one thing to ask you. What? Why you need the girl. Why do you need to know? Just wondering. Another Page seems to talk about Marco Polo's hidden legacy. Hidden legacy? Yeah. But in order to find it, we... need something besides Another Page. Something that the girl has. Even big shots love their treasure. Hmph. I don't really care about it. What? Yes? Well well! Bring him here. What is it? A guest. We've captured Lupin the Third. Rise and shine, Lupin. What are you talking about? Where am I? Lupin, let me explain. Fujiko Mine! You're a part of this too? Where's Lupin? Is that really Lupin? Where is he? - Where's Lupin? - That's strange... Hey, you know where he is! Where's... Excuse me a moment... What're you doing! I knew it... We have a problem! The girl escaped! What? Crap, he was just a distraction. Move! See you, Inspector Zenigata. W-wait, Fujiko! Fujiko! Well now... I've done it again. Um, is Fujiko a part of the ICPO? Look around you. What do you think? But she seems to know you, Mr. Sanders. She's nothing but trouble. I'll explain everything later. Let's go! Long time no see, little Mr. Page. Now, just who is this guy? There we go... Lombardo Heavy Industries. Ships, airplanes... They manufacture all kinds of products. What do we have here? Bernardo Vilar. Singlehandedly built up Lombardo as the president. Why is he after Another Page? What's this? This is...! Let's go, Lup-Inspector Colonel. Mr. Colonel! Hold on! I'm copying some files! Okay, get going! No dilly-dallying! That's my line! Hey, what is this place? It looks like they're making some sort of weapon. Bingo. So these guys are arms dealers. But other companies are saints compared to these guys. You mean... They sell weapons to both allies and enemies. "The Merchant of Death." "The Merchant of Death"? There we go! A siren. But why now? Can't be... What do you mean? W-wait, you don't mean... Mean what? Move! We're in danger! Right! Alright, hang on! Get that shutter open! Got it! Hurry, we don't have time! Amazing... We actually escaped! These two... Who is that guy? He came here with Grandpa. His name is Goemon. Goemon? And? Who is he? He was training in the mountains though he didn't say what for. Training? That's so cool! Don't stare, you're being rude. Now help me with dinner. Are you kidding? Forget it... Stop fooling around! I'm going to challenge him. Ami, help me. What! Challenge Goemon? What are you thinking? We need to know his strength. Have you forgotten our duty? But it's not like that... He has a sword. What if he tries to steal what we're protecting? Well... If you don't want to help, we'll go without you. We can go either way. Right? But you promised to take me out for karaoke. Fine! I'll take you out for karaoke if we hurry up. Really? But it's the eldest daughter who took over our family's duties. What's it going to be? Very well. What do we do? Hey, we need a strategy! Pikon! I've got it! Is that really a "gyaru" word? Don't we have this big, dangerous pile of logs out back? That's right! Bring him to the hill behind the house. Let's go, Ami. 'Kay! Wait! Well? Got anything? I'm having a hard time reading this. It's all scratched out. But it's all in plain Italian. We'll figure it out soon. "At the end of a long journey I found... real treasure surpassing gold." When east meets west, "the two voices that herald the beginning will open the door." I only understood two things from that nonsense. "Real treasure" and "surpassing gold"! But you know, it'll be tough deciphering this and figuring out the treasure's location. Um... Sorry, did we wake you? Uh, no... Is the ICPO looking for the hidden legacy as well? Hm? Uh, sure. It's also our duty to prevent any potential wars. Really... Sounds interesting, doesn't it? We have an ancient mystery to solve here. Isn't it exciting? We've unearthed an ancient mystery to solve here. Once we figure it out, there'll be a timeless message waiting for us. Isn't it exciting? Are you okay? Grandpa Theo said something similar... Really? Um... Can I stay with you two a bit longer? Well, I don't mind... I want to know what Grandpa Theo discovered. Then it's decided! But first... we're all going for a drive to Beijing! Right! Wha... Beijing! Secretary-General, what is the meaning of this! You consider Lupin a suspect and intend to prosecute him! Why? You haven't found any murder weapon! We have witnesses and circumstantial evidence... What the hell are you talking about! I won't stand for these ridiculous accusations! Lupin! Where the hell are you! Tabriz, Iran. Right... The Professor... Professor Claudio? It's Lisa. I'm sorry. My cell phone battery ran out. What, now? What? Why am I mentioned here? "The fugitive murderer Lupin the Third..." and his accomplice Daisuke Jigen... destroyed a Lombardo Heavy Industries... "warehouse and are still at large." Hey, what a story! He framed us... That bastard! We're really in for it now! I'll get him for this... Is something wrong? Uh, well... Just wondering why we have to go all the way to Beijing. Yes, why? You know how difficult Marco Polo's travels were? Yes, even the missionaries who accompanied him ran home. Of course an archaeology major would know that! While he was moving around, do you think... he had time to go treasure hunting? He had a better chance finding... treasures when he stayed put in China. Yeah. Also, I have a few questions to ask someone in Beijing. Who? Bao Long. The Chinese mafia boss? But that guy... Yeah, it's going to be tough getting a hold of him. Beijing... What is it? This. Grandpa Theo said he got this from the Beijing black market. If this can help you... You sure? There're holes here. I think it's a whistle. Grandpa Theo thought it has some connection to Marco. So he thought about going to Beijing as well. Fine... Beijing it is then. Why'd you show me this? Well... You rescued me, but I was never much use... Oh? Finally opening up to your pals? Pals? What do you mean? Thanks. I wasn't much use after all. Don't be silly. We'll need that for later, okay? It's really important. So keep it safe, alright? Yes. "Come to the hill behind the house." Is this where I will be trained, priest? Why are you making that face? Isn't this a little... Don't worry, we'll handle this. Cut the rope on my mark, alright? Okay! Go! Watch out! Goemon! That idiot! Run! The chief priest's... Who is this guy? This is really bad. Are you injured? Thank you very much. No... It is I who must thank you. You risked your life to warn me. Thank you. No... You're injured? Once again... Once again I drew my sword... Goemon... I see... So you want to give up your sword. If the true meaning of swordsmanship... is to give up the sword... Everything I know is useless. Is it right to carry a sword anymore? Such thoughts burden you, yet you draw your sword to protect me... Thank you very much. No... I... thank you. Goemon... She looks perkier than usual. Who is that guy anyways? Don't you know, Grandpa? She's always worrying about the house... but she never thinks about herself. I'm just worried she's taking on too much pressure. Hey, are you listening? Pfft, he's sleeping! Sleeping in that posture... That's so cool! That's so "cool"? Never mind. (He's composing a poem known as waka or tanka) Through my twisted heart Will my innermost desire Become manifest. Soon, it blossoms into fruit. And my hunger is no more. She'll act on her heart's desire? Is that what you're saying? What about the subject? Soon you'll blossom, little apple. Little apple? That was too many syllables... Ami, I need your help. I've got a bad feeling about this... Beijing, China. Sheesh. Just when I thought we made it, we run into this. That's a lively crowd. What now? Go home? Are you kidding? Sometimes you've got to come face-to-face with pops. Inspector Zenigata, we've spotted Lupin! He's here! Our target's Lupin, don't screw this up! Hey! Pops! Get him! Idiots! That's exactly what he wants you to do! He's creating a distraction while... We've got him! Hey pops... I surrender. Ha, that was too easy! Who's under that mask? What the hell are you doing? It's really you! Why? Wouldn't you like to know! Catch you later, pops! No way... Once you know where he's headed, set up a relay. We'll have a demonstration. Lupin, I'm miserable. It was pathetic, the way we caught you... My entire life was dedicated to capturing you. But I got you so easily... Are you listening to me, Lupin! Stop inflating your head and listen... What! What... What the hell's going on? Shoot him! I-idiots! Hold your fire! You see? Lupin escaped! Don't let him get away! After him! Well, this is an unusual visit. What do you want? I have a few things to ask you. But not here. How about a little stroll? Nice timing! So that's his plan. What's wrong? Hm? It's the prison alarm system. Keep up the good work. Lupin! Gotta go, pops! You crazy sonovabitch! I'll get you for this! Lupin! Alright! A casino in a place like this... The perfect place to humiliate a former crime boss. You know Bao Long? Perhaps. Bai Long Zhu Wang tea (White Dragon Pearl) from Fujian. You knew what I wanted. By chance. I cannot believe you went out of your way to help me escape. I can't believe you ended up in prison. Do you know about Lombardo Heavy Industries? You may have heard that they tried to make a deal with us. They got you in jail? They were looking to take away one of my customers. But I politely declined their offer. They wanted to be partners with you even though Chinese mafia bosses have plenty of enemies. Exquisite! I thought I would never drink tea this good again. I am talking about Duke Abel of the Talia Republic. Duke Abel? The Duke is a well-known art collector. He agreed to import our weapons in... exchange for Marco Polo's hidden legacy. Wait, isn't the Talia Republic a neutral country? So? Rather than just manipulating wars behind... the scenes, you want to start them as well? You make it sound like a bad thing. But we're merely supplying a demand. That's business. In the end we will be the world's leading arms manufacturer and have full control over world events. So this is all because of some art maniac. Marco Polo's rolling in his grave. Marco Polo? Yeah, we're looking at "The Travels of Marco Polo." Know anything? So the famous Lupin the Third is a history student now. It's just personal interest. Legends tell of a settlement along the... coast, though there's no evidence. They say Marco Polo went, not to the South China Sea but rather went far east. Far east of China? Perhaps. This is how the legend goes. The Mongolian Empire once dominated the world. The root cause of this ambition was to unite the world so that there would be no more wars. I suppose that was Genghis Khan's ideal. Soon after Kublai Khan succeeded the throne, he met Marco Polo. During his world travels, Marco Polo was also... grieved by the outbreak of pointless wars. So Kublai Khan got along well with Marco Polo. They both had similar ideals. So together, they crafted a treasure. Treasure? Yes. Marco then separated the treasure into... two parts, keeping one part for himself and carrying the other to the far east. It is said that when the two parts are rejoined, you will get real treasure. Two parts... Hm? What is that? Nothing... Far east of China, you said? Yes. Marco Polo then headed east to Genghis Khan's true birthplace. True birthplace? No way... You can't be saying that Genghis Khan was really General Yoshitsune! Heh... Of course not. Genghis Khan was a big man. The size difference between him and Yoshitsune is simply too great. They probably never even met. Well, that's how the story goes. What does that writing say? This? These are Dongba symbols. Hieroglyphs used in Tibet and Yunnan. Hieroglyphs... Wait... These scratches... Maybe they're not scratches at all... If a foreigner were to make crude copies of Kanji characters... I finally got the location of the treasure. Hiraizumi. Iwate, Japan. Instead of dating me, you decide to tail me? That's bad manners. Are you jealous, Lupin? Of course! There's only one thing that keeps me going, day after day. You mean me? But of course! That's enough. I have some questions for you now. Well, if it isn't Mr. Bao. Hope you don't mind if my boys have a look at your casino. Duke Abel has some sense in him. He won't be swayed by scum like you. Oh? After whetting his appetite with a few art pieces he became our senior advisor. Senior advisor? So what now, Lupin? This guy's your business rival. Buying time so that your friend can point a gun at my head? Do it. What's taking him so long? I'm freezing my butt off here... It's cold... Huh? Mr. Sanders! Leave the driving to me. I'm sorry! I don't have a license! Don't worry about it. In Hiraizumi? So we're headed to "the land of gold", Japan. Very naughty, eavesdropping on us... I wonder how your buddies are doing. It's a dangerous thing to underestimate my buddies. Zai Jian (Goodbye)! Whoa, it's aiming at us! My casino...! Using our tanks to blow up shops... That's can't be good for our public image. What's the plan? Get out of the alley and head towards the river. Agreed! Activate Zeal. They'll shoot us as soon as we reach the bridge! Don't worry, just keep going! We won't make it... Maybe, maybe not! It'll be fun finding out which! Speak for yourself. Might as well put up a sign that says, "Hey, blow us up!" Should've read the weight limit sign! Hey! What the hell is that! Crap, this is bad... Aah! Run away! Alright, stop the relay. The relay... After our demonstration, there'll be... plenty of customers around the world. Now that they've seen the power of your weapon... Prepare ID-03. That bastard... I'll get him for this. That was a weapon? So it seems. If you're going to Japan, take this boat. Really? I'll be getting off at Tianjin. Their jasmine tea is superb. Well, there's no way I'd refuse an offer from a mafia boss. What? Mafia boss? Why is the ICPO working with the mafia? ICPO? Uh... He might be a mafia boss but he's cooperating with the ICPO. Right? But that's weird, the police and the mafia... Society misunderstands many things. Sometimes what people consider common sense is in fact a falsity. When in doubt, trust your own eyes. Eyes? Your eyes do not lie about what they have seen. Remember that. What was all that crap? What's this? Blueprints for the weapon. I have a favor to ask of you. Y-yes? Go to Hiraizumi, Iwate in Japan. We have one last job. Apples do not crave bloodshed. They follow the ultimate path of the sword. But if I face an enemy, bloodshed will inevitable follow. If I am aware of that wherever I go... Goe-Goe! Hi-ya! Goe-Goe...? Are you addressing me? Yup! Grandpa says take a bath. A bath... He said eating, sleeping, bathing, all that is training. I heard this before. Everything we do in life... is training. Hee hee, that's right! Training... How did he do that? He sensed my presence... Nah, that's nonsense. Rumi? What is it? F-forgive me! Why won't it open! Goemon? Forgive me! I did not know you were here! This door won't open! Those two... I'm sorry. This was Rumi and Ami's doing. To what purpose? Why don't you get in! No! I cannot... The door's stuck... Isn't it cold over there? I could catch a cold... Fine! I'll get in... Training! That's right, it's training! That's right. It's... training... I'm sorry. I'll talk to those two afterwards. Hiromi, you and your family... Who are you? You've been watching my every move. You were incredibly agile when those logs were falling. The callus on your hands are from years of martial arts. You are not ordinary people. Is there something going on? Hiromi, that'll do. Grandpa! Chief priest! Just as I thought, you have keen insight. There's something I want to show you. Me? Come with me. Hey, Grandpa... Yes? When did you come in? Before you did. Ow! Sorry. Didn't mean to bother you. No... It's okay. With Grandpa Theo gone, and all these things happening around us... It just seems unreal. I know what you mean. What kind of person is Lupin? Murdering people like that... Why would he do that? If you knew that, would you take revenge? I... Get some sleep. Yes. Hmph, all this time she was holding a grudge. And our quest seems pretty hopeless. Won't know until we try. Don't know about that. But you know... She's so cute when she's honest! Yeah... Hm! Did I say that out loud? Lover boy... This is... The Seven Tools of Benkei. Musashibo Benkei? That's right. Generation after generation it was my... family's duty to protect these Seven Tools. What! Then Hiromi and the others... To protect the Seven Tools, we've trained them since they were young. That explains her agility and callus... I feel that I had enough. What do you mean? The Seven Tools of Benkei... Polearm, iron rake, war hammer, saw... Spear fork, push pole, sleeve entangler... Do you notice anything? There's no sword. So it is incomplete. Incomplete...? In our temple it is said that Benkei in fact had eight tools. So if a sword is included... Yes! The final tool used by Benkei was the Golden Sword. When the eighth tool is found, peace will... come upon this earth, according to legend. The Golden Sword. Our family's most cherished wish is to find... this sword and protect the Seven Tools. But... I wish to to break free from this endless cycle. Why? The history of the Golden Sword is a history of hardship. My son and his wife were caught in this cycle and died because of it. I doubt that Musashibo Benkei would have wanted us to suffer so much just for a sword. I do not wish to see Hiromi and the others suffer the same fate. Goemon, I have a request. What is it? Will you marry Hiromi? She should be free to pursue her own happiness. I just want her to find happiness in an ordinary life. What are you saying? Stop being so selfish! Hiromi! I decided to continue father and mother's duties. I will find the Golden Sword! Do you really think that's what they'd want? You just want to forget about their deaths. You have no right to decide how I feel... Hiromi... I'm sorry about this, Goemon. Forgive me. Please forget this. I've dedicated my life to training. I have not yet considered marriage. But... I will do everything in my power to help you break free of this cycle! It's beautiful... Looking at this, I can believe in a "treasure that surpasses gold." Hm? What's wrong? Sorry... I'm overwhelmed... Overwhelmed... This golden hall represents a peaceful utopia. A world without any wars. The same thing Marco and Kublai Khan hoped for. Yes. When I thought about how everyone wishes for this utopia for some reason, I started to cry. Whoever made this had the same dream, I guess. Yeah. More like delusions. It's no accident these guys had the same dream. You mean Hiraizumi has some connection with Marco Polo? Maybe his legacy's hidden somewhere here. One thing's for sure: We'll find answers in Hiraizumi. But according to historical studies... Hm? What is it? He might be right. Hey, we're done with the golden hall? The legacy isn't here. What? Why? But the golden hall in Chusonji temple... has been around since Marco Polo. They can only hide the golden hall. Not "treasure surpassing gold." I guess. So what next? No idea. Sheesh, we should have taken Goemon with us. Goemon? Isn't that a samurai name? Yeah, one of our partners. The ICPO's a pretty diverse group! I guess. Goemon, huh? Goe-Goe. Goe-Goe? Who're you, old man? Are you looking for Goe-Goe? Who's Goe-Goe? No questions! Hya! You old fart! What was that for! Hwaaaa! That stance... 20 points. Hey, you okay? Beardo! Are you with him? Gah! Wait, wait! No fighting! Hey gramps, if you have a problem, talk to me. If you have a problem with the priest, talk to me. Goemon? Wha... Lupin! The ICPO samurai! ICPO? Y-yeah! This is Detective Goemon Ishikawa. Why do we keep running into each other? I must ask, what business do you have here? Nothing, just a little treasure hunt. Treasure hunt? Yeah, there's some gold hidden away in Hiraizumi. Hm? What did I say? Secretary-General! What are you saying! Lupin didn't murder the Professor! Hey, wait! Damn it! You guys, get a move on! Lupin's gang is in Hiraizumi! Right, Professor? Y-yes. That is what Lisa told me. You heard him. Now put all your effort into arresting Lupin! He got away from me in Beijing but now we need to protect Lisa. Please... Leave it to me! Amazing. I never thought the Seven Tools of Benkei actually existed. Wow... Are you sure about this? Impermanence. Everything fades away. Our most cherished wishes cannot be fulfilled. That is what I always believed until now. The Golden Sword, long buried in history, may yet see the light. Perhaps this will come to pass. But Marco Polo's legacy and the Golden Sword... Which one's in Hiraizumi? Ah, I see now. We were too focused on Japan. There's one thing we didn't consider. Like what? Lisa, remember what we talked about at the golden hall? Marco and Kublai, the people who crafted the golden hall... They all had the same ideals... Oh! You mean... They crafted the same treasure? That's what it sounds like. Then the legacy is in fact the Golden Sword? Remember the last verse of Another Page? "When east meets west, the two voices that herald the beginning will open the door." Benkei from the east, and Marco Polo from the west... Did you say "Ana-Hachiman"? "Another Page." Oh, okay! What's that? It's from "The Travels of Marco Polo." To put it simply, it's an ancient manuscript. Ancient manuscript... What happened to ours? You also have it? It's hard to make out what it says but it was stored along with the Seven Tools. Where is it now? Hey Ami, you had it the other day. Where did it go? Uh, that manuscript? Well... Stay cool! "Cool"? It's in a clear plastic folder... Plastic folder...? Oh no, it's a placemat! Idiots! You turned a family heirloom... into a "face map" or whatever! I'm screwed, aren't I? "Screwed"? I'm sorry! What's wrong? Excuse me a moment... Is she all right? Just give her a moment. I'll be back in a bit. Maybe we should... No, it's better if a woman talks to her. I'll get the manuscript, too. Thanks. She's a good girl. Yes, a fine woman... No, I mean...! Huh. So much for training... Looks like we'll have to talk later. We have company? Yep. Alright, here they come! They don't need help. Looks like fun. What the hell are you doing? I will not draw my sword. Lupin! I'll handle this! Lisa! When they tried to grab me, Hiromi...! Bastards! Wait! Don't go, it's a trap! But they've captured Hiromi because of me! Lisa! Take this! I don't need this! Take it for good luck. Where's Hiromi? Sorry, they've got her. What! And Lisa? She felt responsible, so she went after them. What in the world are you thinking? You'll see. Where are you? Lupin! Lisa. I need a bridge! Hiromi, I'm so sorry... Lisa. Professor... Professor Claudio! I've been looking for you. Because of me, someone was... It's okay. You're going home now. I'm sorry. This wasn't supposed to happen. Supposed...? Anyways, let's go. Or else... Lupin's gonna kill ya! Right? We meet again, Professor. Mr. Colonel. Lupin... Lupin? Your grandfather's murderer, Lupin the Third! Lupin...? No, he's... You're wrong! Right, Mr. Colonel? Please say something... Mr. Colonel! My name... is Lupin the Third. You lied to me... all this time? Yeah. You murdered... Grandpa Theo? So they say. You monster...! Lisa, shoot him! Avenge your grandfather! Oh, so I'm your next victim? You've been keeping yourself busy. All along you've been a double agent for both Lombardo and the ICPO: L-lies! Don't play innocent! You're working for Lombardo Heavy Industries. Do you see now? Who the real enemy is? The real enemy? Him! He's the murderer! Yeah, until tomorrow. Don't bother me till then. Analyze this. What are you people doing in our city! Who the hell are you? We grabbed Lisa and then you came in acting like a hero. Does everyone in Japan know karate? Whatever. You're our human shield now. It's here! Don't listen to that murderer! Sheesh. Your attitude's a dead giveaway. Now, Mr. President-elect, we see your true nature. President-elect? Do you remember Fujiko? Your kidnapper? At the time she was seducing the Lombardo president I was snooping around... W-what the hell... Where are the notes on Marco? Theo Argento... You did this? N-no! The Professor...! Hurry up! No! It wasn't me! My condolences, old man. A diary? W-who's there! Here we go... No... You decide what to believe. Don't believe him! He's been lying to you all this time! It's him! Lupin the Third is the culprit! What... What is the truth? Remember what Mr. Bao said to you. When in doubt... trust your own eyes. But I don't know! Still can't decide? Stop relying so much on others. Decide for yourself... Or your future will always be closed, little lady! I... I think... You're telling me the truth! No! You finally decided... Correctly. No! What a comfortable vehicle! Want to get on? No need! Aw, the prince is running off to rescue the princess. Like a real Japanese prince. You're okay without Zantetsuken? He doesn't need it. Besides, he isn't answering us. Stubborn as usual. Let me go! I said let me go! Why won't you listen! I didn't kill him! You're going to destroy it? It breaks my heart, but I must do it. If anyone finds this, wars would break out. Marco Polo would not have wanted that. But what about his hidden legacy? Ah...! How do you know... Have you been reading my diary! Let me go! Y-you! You finally did it, Mr. President-elect. A-am I really...? Yeah, everything's arranged. Protect Another Page! What are you doing! The young lady looked like she was in trouble. Did I bruise something? I left a little something behind your collar. A bug! I heard everything. Why me? At the cemetery... Run, Lisa! There's no point in sacrificing yourself as well! You made it sound like the Professor's death was a sacrifice. So I dug up some information. There's one particular bar you seem to love. Here's what she said: "When he becomes prez, he'll buy me anything!" Wine and women are a dangerous mix. Is she considered attractive in your country? No, she's pretty ordinary... Give her back! You like her that much? I mean Lisa! So you're going to shoot me with Lupin's Walther? We need to find him! He might be... Don't worry. If his own Walther can shoot him, he'd be arrested a million times. Sheesh! That was cold! Hey, there it is! Now, time to end this. S-stay back! This isn't a toy you can just wave around! He loaded blanks just in case you made the wrong choice. Lupin... What's this! Inspector Zenigata. Weren't you prohibited from investigating this area? Yeah. But I promised to capture a certain little thief wherever he goes. So you violate orders? I have an apology letter, don't worry about me. How shrewd. Professor! Take the girl with you. Hold it! Resist and I'll kill the girl instead. It's a promise. As soon as she gets in... kill him. Ruggiero (Roger)! What! Gah! Inspector! Get in! That thing's harder than a tank. Try one more shot. Why? Just do it. Yeah, yeah. You've got to be kidding! Must have been the yell. Hiromi is inside that thing? Yeah, Lisa too. Grandpa! Sorry to keep you waiting! I told them not to come... That's how girls are. They elimiated all our men? Raise the container! Go! Ruggiero. Crap, how can you fight with just one 25mm vulcan? Add another one! Hiromi! Goe-Goe. Please... Save our sister. As you wish! You'll be nothing but ashes! An inescapable sword from the sky! That's as far as you go. Hand that over, that's a good boy. What are you doing! Stalking your prey without a sound... Basic thief stuff. Well done, Lupin the Third. Don't applaud me. You used to be some cheap salesman. For free! Sorry, you have the wrong guy. I remember when you promoted the sales of attack robots. What a shock! Me, working for some puny little workshop? I wouldn't call it puny. Have a look at the monitor. Hi! Fujicakes! You're still alive! What did you say? It was terrible! He shoved me into this room and said: "You're of no use to me now." Kick his butt, will you? Sure thing! Now you see what you're up against. Now be a good boy and land this thing. Now! I'm going! Seriously...? Goe-Goe! Go! Don't give me that look. You were the main villain in our little story. But now you'll have a nice, long chat with pops! Fujiko! Stick with me, and you'll have everything... Sorry! I've got this... And I've got her... And also... I hate your guts! Where have you taken her? Goemon. R-right over there... I have come for you. My lord Goemon... What's with all these sparkles? I think those are sparks... Did you cut away too much? He sure did. We're losing control! Hurry! L-Lisa! I'll never forgive you... for what you did. This is bad! This is too much... What? Are you telling me to jump off? You're terrible! It's okay. I can manage a fall from the height of a cedar tree. But I can't! You're leaving me behind! Speed boost! Tom Cruise! Who am I kidding. I think he's screaming for help. No umbrellas? No balloons? Wanna help him out? This is getting tiring... Gimme a break here! It's exactly the same as my manuscript? Yeah, these words were taken from Another Page. Then Marco Polo once visited Hiraizumi? Apparently. The only difference is the last verse, "At journey's end, the lord will be resurrected." Christ's resurrection? No, this refers to somebody's superior... Musashibo Benkei's lord, Yoshitsune? Really? Grandpa, you didn't know? News to me. Hey, gramps... The Seven Tools aren't your only secrets, are they? Grandpa. Why don't you tell him? Musashibo Benkei the 22nd, I am! What! What're you going to do? His future son-in-law's gonna be the 23rd. Goemon Ishikawa the 13th and Benkei the 23rd... You care that much? Hey! Where's the treasure! Yeah, just a moment! Can I borrow your pendant? Remember what Another Page says. "The two voices..." "That herald the beginning." Yep. Now listen carefully. Wow! It echoed! Resonance? It must have the same shape as this pendant. Master craftsmanship, huh? So small! I'm going home. That's your treasure? Stubborn jerk. Forget about that stupid trinket! As long as I have this, I'll never have any enemies! Thanks for reminding me this. Better not do it. Lupin the Third, begging for his life! Goodbye! Addio, Lupin! I warned him. Mr. Bao came through just in time. Yeah, I asked him to make some changes to the Zeal system. Though I told him to delete it sometime soon. I guess he took his sweet time. Scary. Anyways, about the treasure... What, there's more? Isn't there something missing? Missing? A sword needs a scabbard... Scabbard? We have one that small? As a matter of fact... My pendant... Transcending time... and space. That's really neat. And then... You can read this, right? "Prendendo una lezione dal passato." "Examine the past to learn new things." "Onkochishin." (An idiomatic phrase with the same meaning) That's what Grandpa Theo said. "Live life to the full. Live for the future. History only exists so that we know the past." "Knowing the sorrows of the past goes hand in hand... with looking to the future"... in other words. Grandpa. Rumi, Ami. Bring the Tools. The Tools? I'm ending this. Ending what? Don't you understand? I'm throwing them away. What! Are you sure? We all have a future to look forward to. Our ancestors wouldn't have wanted us to be stuck in the past. Agreed? Yes. This? This is it? All that and the punch line is a toothpick! But aren't those lovely words? "Look to the past" and all that! More after this! Also, a nice present for you! 風に髪をとかれ kaze ni kami wo tokare. The wind brushing through my hair おやすみのくちづけを oyasumi no kuchizuke wo. A goodnight kiss 愛を胸に抱いて ai wo mune ni dai te. Bring love close to your chest ふるえて眠れ furuete nemure. Tremble as you sleep いつの日に結ばれるまだ見えないあなたよ itsu no hi ni musubareru mada minai anata yo. One day we will be together Though I've never seen you この体もまごころも贈りたい昨日から明日へ kono karada mo magokoro mo okuritai kinou kara ashita he... I want to give my body and my devotion From yesterday to tomorrow 愛を胸に抱いて ai wo mune ni dai te. Bring love close to your chest ふるえて眠れ furuete nemure. Tremble as you sleep. - More after this! - Also, a nice present for you! Hello? Oh, it's Lupin. Nice work. I knew I could count on you. You can get rid of Zeal now. Get rid of what? Hey, stop joking. A weapon that collects solar flares... Controllable even up to the ozone layer... Throw it away! What a waste! Thanks for the gift, I'll put it to good use! Hey! Oh, yeah. As a token of thanks, I've given your... location to your eternal soulmate! Lupin! You're under arrest! You've got to be kidding! If you will not draw your sword to confront your enemies then for what will you draw your sword? I will draw my sword to protect what is important. THE END
