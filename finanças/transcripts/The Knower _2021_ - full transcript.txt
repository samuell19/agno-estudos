In August, 1945, WWII ended with the atomic bomb This is what we know, right? But this is not the main reason That war could have lasted another 3 or 4 years "Lecture hall, a security agency March 2020" but for Alan Turing, the mathematician who decrypted the Enigma machine Enigma was a cipher machine the Brits found in a German submarine Turing could decrypt it and helped the Allies decipher all German messages "Cairo, November 2013" That man could end a war of weapons, but started a fiercer war The information warfare Starting that day espionage has become the real war Any info you get on your enemy even if small or insignificant will take you one step ahead A weapon that can be used by any country that can't buy real arms but can train agents After the advent of the internet a new kind of spies appeared A kind that evolves quicker than any weapon does Spies who don't need to live in enemy states We know them as hackers "The hacker with the alias the Knower breaks into a telecom company" Hackers break into anything Your phone, laptop, Facebook account Your car, electricity, aviation even PlayStation Anything connected to the internet "Egyptian hacker the Knower exposes a corrupt businessman" The most dangerous thing about a hacker is that you don't see him "The Knower breaks into the secure systems of many major companies" You can't tell where he'll hit This has made hackers now the world's most powerful weapon A weapon anyone can employ, for good or evil To build or destroy But regardless of what any weapon can do, what is it in the end? An inanimate subject A slave But you're not so because the game is in here Not here You'll choose which path to follow Good or evil Will you gain from it, or let others gain? Hackers are smart by nature and often go astray This makes them mercenaries More like a weapon a weapon in the hands of conscienceless people "Breaking: Downtown Cairo Electricity Company Hacked" "Access granted" A group called "Circle Ten" is behind this They're armed hackers led by a guy called Rady El-Husseiny He's on terrorist lists in many countries He works for he who pays more They're stationed at a factory in Imbaba A heavily populated area - We got the drone image - Thermal cam activated It shows nine elements in that location We got ten minutes only to go in and out Then, special forces will step in We'll make little noise I don't want any casualties The data they got is what matters M1, arrived M2, arrived M3, arrived Cut the power off First element down Number two, area clear Ground floor clear Three Freeze! On the floor! M2, go to the server room Number nine is still alive "Thermal view" A moving object in the room to the right Negative, sir, no room to the right M2, there is a moving object signal in the room to your right Move Got yourself burned, Rady? Nothing is burned yet Everything will go up in flames Evacuate! - Get out! - Quick! Element number ten arrested "Algeria, January 2019" "Derna, Southern Libya" "God is Greatest" "There is no god but Allah" Allah is Greatest Peace be with you Peace and blessings be with you Tell me what you think about traitors Should they be allowed to repent before being killed, or be directly killed? Whatever you see fit, Maulana What's your opinion about this, Ghazi? You know best about such things, Sheikh Abu Anas - Get up! - No, Maulana! - Get up! - No god but Allah! It's the last time! We've been waiting for two weeks but nothing has been done You promised me You gave me a list of aliases Each lives in a different country I already found two of them Your men killed them Because they didn't know where the weapons are Listen, Ghazi I didn't see the names on the list I gave you in a dream It's all confirmed information As long as I killed them, it means they didn't know the weapons location If you don't believe me, send one of your men to ask those dead guys Allah is Greatest! There is no god but Allah Listen, Ghazi Breaking a promise is just like treason I don't have time or patience for such things Abu Anas I'm different from all those men around you I'll make you reach the weapons I'm bound to reach the weapons These weapons will change many things I'm an impatient man Ghazi I'm waiting for what we agreed on You got no excuse No funeral prayer for him Forsaking me means forsaking the faith "Security Agency, Cairo" Good morning, sir - Morning, Morad - Hello, Ibrahim - Hello, sir - Please You called me "sir, this must be important Our men in Libya monitored a meeting held by Abu Anas who traffics weapons into Egypt This lead us to an important discovery Isn't that the guy from Circle Ten? He died in the Idlib explosion Exactly, Rady El-Husseiny aka Ghazi El-Assadi now That explosion was a cover-up for him to escape Think this had to do with the hacking attempts on us and other countries then? Sure, his being alive makes me suspect him especially those hacking attempts had the same Circle Ten methodology Found out about the leaks? I will find out You must know who's behind the hacking and who benefits from it and the nature of Rady's relation with Abu Anas This is why I demand the Knower to be summoned Younis? He's been staying at his home for two years Get him involved in this? Really, Morad? He's been away from the Agency but not from my watchful eyes "North Coast, February 2019" Plus, Rady is an open book for him Surely, you remember how he arrested him before Younis is an open book for Rady as well Remember he targeted him and his family before It's like you're sacrificing him He's the best for this operation "The fierce fight over Libya's capital Tripoli intensifying even further" "following an air strike by the rebel military on the city's only functioning airport" Younis! "It is considering a temporary ban..." Wake up! Younis, wake up, it's twelve Younis, get up, dude Dude! Yes, Aramex delivered the new game Okay, dear, sorry Dad will sleep an hour then wake up and play with you Younis, you brought me here during the vacation to sleep? You'd have just left me with mommy Sorry, dear, I won't sleep an hour Let's sleep half an hour then wake up and play a lot, come here - Enough, wake up! - Okay, I'm up Hello, good morning What's up? You called many times early in the morning. What is it? Where are you? My company's system had a cyber attack I tried to remove the Trojans, but lost control of the keyboard, I can't type It's a new Trojan called "I love you" It just came out two days ago Remove the code ending with A045 from the registry - Way to go, Younis - Call yourself an engineer! - Bye - Bye - What was that "I love you" code? - None of your business - This is my stuff - You won't get up and play with me - Playing will never end - But the vacation will Okay, Emad, make me some coffee to focus with this girl - Happening, sir - You! Your mom made you a big mouth No, I take after you - What to do now? - Push X I'll push X, here - Coffee - Thanks - Step aside, Emad - OK What? Wait here Bummer! Good morning - Yes? - We'll talk standing here? Come in - Notified him? - Sent him two officers, plus security guys to give him your orders and escort him back, sir Dad's friends, Farida My daughter Farida Good morning, Farida Why have they got identical outfits? - Are you twins? - Farida! - That was rude, go in there - Will you be long? Not much Get going Sorry, as you can see we got many important things to do - Yes, we got important things! - Farida Get in there Emad, get the gentlemen some coffee No sugar We have orders to summon you Regardless of the orders or who sent you, I'm not going anywhere It's better to deliver this message yourself Emad Pour their coffee in plastic cups They'll take it and leave. Please Believe me, it's not in our best interest to fall out We're carrying out clear-cut orders I refuse This won't look good before the girl Okay, have a seat I'll go change I got an equally skilled replacement in case Younis refuses He may be even better and more adept Did I ask you for a replacement? I assigned you to do something specific - Confirmed info? - Hamid El-Tarabulsy Ex-Libyan officer, was living in Algeria under the alias Ali Etman Died two days ago Police says it's a suicide, but our info says he was one of those whose names were leaked from Mr. Arafa's agency This suggests it's an assassination See what your two officers did with Younis Calling twelve, 24 escaped and is on the way to you, follow up Six - Send a car for them 20:12 - Yes, okay, got it 24 got away - "Going after 24" - What do you want to listen to? Anything but this noise! - This game is better, isn't it? - It's nice! - Okay - "Car description and license plate..." "The consulate of an Arab country, Cairo" Got an idea why I'm here or do I need an introduction? Arafa briefly talked with me I'd like you to explain to me in detail The Agency has been targeted by a number of failed cyber attacks These same attacks broke into your system and Mr. Arafa's Very important data was leaked which has to do with weapon trafficking in the region "24 got away" I want all this data What hacking and what data are you talking about? The leaked data include the names of ex-Libyan army officers This is impossible At least at my Agency Mr. Jawad, I'm talking about actual results on the ground Jarir El-Ali, an ex-Libyan officer was killed in London Surely, you know him as he lived in your country using another name We know about this incident We didn't have his name Three days later Hamid El-Tarabulsy was killed in Algeria Another ex-Libyan army officer These assassinations are a direct result of the leaks Mr. Morad, seems your source needs to check their information True an alliance takes common interests but at times, in our work we cooperate with those with opposing interests Here I am, trying to find common grounds for cooperation with you I know, I'm sure of it Otherwise, I wouldn't have come to Egypt within 24 hours after brother Arafa asked for a meeting Sorry, I wish I could help you Obviously, Mr. Jawad doesn't have orders to cooperate with us or maybe he thought we'd talk about something else As you say in Egypt I've said everything I got Correct? I believe the meeting is over My presence is not needed anymore I'll get the data I want, unofficially What's up with Younis? He escaped from them, sir They informed him then Sorry, I'll get my work done and come back in a couple of days - And the game? - We'll continue it But tell you what Don't tell mom what happened, it's a secret Okay, Mr. Younis What do you do exactly? I work at a very big company Company! Tell mom then as she says you don't work - Mommy! - Dida, my darling Your bag, dear, good night - Thank you - Why are you back? It's nothing Just a work problem I couldn't solve Won't even spend the holiday with her? I told you I got work problems Work? It's more important than me but not than your daughter, Younis Later on, take time off when you promise her something Don't spoil your relation with her too Excuse me "Top fighter, took part in the special forces squad targeting Circle Ten" "Hackers and saboteurs were arrested" Hello Mr. Omar, a new attack is taking place They're trying to bypass our firewall but I can't pinpoint the hacker location - to be able to deal with it - Okay, we'll call you back Want something to drink? Won't you leave me alone? When you used to come see me you'd greet me first I came back early especially for you If you sent for me in that annoying way for work, sir I'm done, retired Sit down, listen to me Nothing new to listen to I said what I got to say How are Farida and Reem? They're good What are you up to now? Trying to fix what you ruined in my life - But I can't - I don't believe this I know you always do what you want to do I can't bring back those who died because of me You didn't teach me that People die when destined to, Younis Only the weak and losers focus on why people die Right, the weak and losers This is why I'm no good anymore Not up to you to decide this Mr. Morad, find someone else to ruin his life You never wondered, when I first met you you were young and so full of yourself and you'd hack dirty businessmen websites to expose them Why I didn't get you convicted? Because I was of use to you Right, but there are many with your same skills Those who want to work with us are even more I chose you because nobody could buy you Not for sale Why did you leave your wife and daughter? Wanted me to stay with her? How come? What could I tell her? The nature of my work with you? Or that her parents died because of me? Do you doubt that I fear for you, your wife and daughter? You feel guilty for the death of two close people Think then about many other people who may die if you don't do what you can do Mr. Morad, don't make me feel like a coward escaping from you I served this country and paid the price The price that only you and I know Regardless of the reasons I won't work with you again End of text Your car is downstairs, intact Even if I tell you Rady is still alive? Younis, get up, honey You've been sleeping so long Oh is it already morning? I didn't have a chance to rest at all You must be kidding Sorry, I had work I miss you Same here Is she asleep? Yes, with my parents in their room - "With my parents in their room" - I'll go to sleep Wait, sleep! I want to talk to you about something very important Dida emailed me yesterday She was very upset - Really? Dida emailed you? - Yeah She said "Younis, my only father" "I want a brother to play with, I feel lonely" - Really? - You bet! Stop it, my parents are asleep in there It's super cool they're asleep in there The girl is sleeping in their bed too Much better than having her coming here every night and bothering us When she sleeps early, you come late or just use your PC I feel like it was your second wife! Come on, would I have a machine for a second wife? - This was rude! - I mean if I marry another woman she'll be a stunner like you - We can't, they may wake up - We'll talk silently - Sure? - Play dead! - Reem! Reem! - Speak of the devil Yes, mom - Dida is feverish and threw up - What? I woke up and found her feverish and she threw up - She's running a high temp! - Call a doctor No, I'll take her to hospital I'll just wear my shoes - Give her to me - It's okay - I want daddy - Let's go Don't worry, kids always fall ill - Come on, what are you doing? - Getting some stuff - Wait, I'll get dressed and come too - No, you stay - I'll ring you when I get there - Put this on her, it's cold outside - This hurts! - Sorry, dear - Keep us updated, Younis - She'll be fine Forgot my wallet Dad! No! He went home yesterday I think he irrevocably turned us down He'll come He just doesn't know yet For now, the attack was on my database port I tried to locate the hackers to handle them, but couldn't So, I shut down the whole session Open all possible hacking ports Let them try to break into again As expected, a point net was made which was routed to another session - I'll try to locate them - Nice having you around, Younis Very high traffic, Younis Explain to me what's happening - Some files are being leaked - What've you been doing then? What have you reached? They hacked the system, sir What are you doing? It's over Can you determine the leaked data? He couldn't locate the hackers will he know what was leaked? What's this? All leaked files are shortcuts Sofia The attack is from Sofia but I can't pinpoint the exact location yet And the leaked data? All fake, sir I sent it to locate them Reached him? Trying, sir, but their system is difficult It doesn't accept any non-Bulgarian IP Use a fake Bulgarian IP to have access They listed all IPs allowed to have access Say you got ten kids I can't tell you that you have eleven But I can tell you I'm one of your kids "Try harder next time The Knower" Younis Younis Abdel Hamid Abdel Megid El-Hennawy Living in Jordan as Hemdan El-Salih Only come back after finding out the weapons location Tell the men to keep their eyes wide open I'll come visit them in Egypt soon Right Take the first flight to Belgrade using a British passport Take a train from there to Sofia "Sofia, Bulgaria" One of our men will be waiting for you at the station to facilitate your mission God be with you "Train station, Sofia, Bulgaria" I love you, never loved anyone more How come?

Very handy in heavy traffic - Ass'ad! Yes Where is the stuff? Know where this bank is? Yeah sure, in Bulgaria Downtown I mean, I know where "Bulgarian National Bank" The hacking happened from inside the bank so I need to access their system Most probably, the man we seek works at the bank too No other way to get him besides hacking the bank? I'll disable the bank's security system It's not easy, but I'll manage - Almost there, Younis - Okay "United Bank of Bulgaria" Long time, Ghazi I still arise, Midko Is this the money? They make here the best arak in town You have to try it Is it hidden? It's a Zero Day virus One KB, okay? Easily hacked into any firewall totally untraceable All good?

Why didn't you say so? - How come you know Evan? - Just as you do You came to know who's behind the hack I came for the same reason Working with who, pretty lady? Younis Mohamed Abdel Hamid Abdel Hamid, right? Right Seems you know me well I know everything about you By the way you don't look British at all and this grey-beige color doesn't suit you And you don't look like a pickpocket - Won't you tell me working for who? - We're on the same boat - We have the same goal - What's this? What's this, Younis? Shall I return in 15 min or will you take longer? - I was with Syrian security - And work for who now? For myself For yourself? Great Am I supposed to believe this?

"Enter password to unlock this drive" Even was the bank's IT guy Just a middleman They used him to carry out their operations through the bank's system Found out who hired him? No, he was killed Why didn't you secure your target knowing how important he was? I tried, but another party got on the way - "Incorrect password" - What do you mean by that? A woman, looks well-trained She knows all about me and the operation Trust no one, Younis, other agencies must be after what we're seeking You just need to know who hired Evan I will find out, sir I want the man behind this alive "Data will be deleted" - Ass'ad - Yes Give me Maya's number Want it now? She asked you to take it and you just kept refusing I'll call her, by the time she's here, you will have disappeared I'll put some beer in the fridge then - What's up, Omar? - You must see this, sir Abdel Megid El-Hennawy, an ex-Libyan officer was assassinated today His name was among those leaked from Mr. Arafa's agency Call Arafa Dad must be busy He said he'd be back in two days Two days passed but he hasn't called me - He'll call you - Why doesn't dad live with us? He's always at work But you told me before he didn't work Make you some pancakes, Dida? Don't want "Call the girl, she's upset" Hi there I told you that you'd need me I'd never do without you, come in You could say "Please" first - Be a gentleman - You're not here to do your hair You're a serial killer How can you stay here? How can you tolerate living here? I can't stay in such a place at all - You know, when I was little... - No! Hold on Childhood memories need a chaise longue where you'd lie down then tell me all about your issues as a little girl I'm not your therapist, unlock it - No problem, on one condition - Can't, I'm taken Funny, too? That data belongs to us both On what basis? Okay - Make up your mind and let me know - Wait, edgy lady, we're talking here I told you that you'd need me but you didn't get me You have your goal, mine is the same If we won't reach it together, I'll just go So? Will we reach an agreement or each just gives it their best shot? Agreed, on one condition I call the shots You obey my words to the letter Evan made a fortune working with them Sure or he wouldn't have compromised his bank position Still, he was a loser They offed him Wasn't it Pernik? I don't know what I'd do without you This is the location, eh? Well done Don't worry at all I'll throw you some peanuts in a while Bye You animal! Immature geezer! Creep! Darn you! Immature? Calling me an immature geezer, Maya? God forgive you Hurry up, Maya I've been waiting for your an hour! How immature! "Berneck, 40 km west of Sophia" The groom has a lot of guests today Wait! Someone else is coming Maya... what is the perfume you are wearing? A target is approaching at ten a clock Thanks, gorgeous I'll save you whenever you are about to get hanged Younis What is the matter, Younis? Younis - A surprise, right? - What surprise? I am here especially for you, Rady Rady? I haven't heard this name in a long time By the way, I didn't like it Thanks for making me change it Since you changed your name, you should have changed the Circle Ten nonsense too Forget about the Circle Ten It was a local business Now we are doing international stuff What do you think? About what? Are you talking to someone else? I was able to get to you I lured you here, and now you are standing on a kilogram of C4 Are you aware that once the springs are out of their place you will be blown to pieces The biggest piece will be the size of... Actually, nothing will remain of you You want the springs to get out of their place, right? Don't worry about me from the C4 I have been in worse situations You mean that time when your father-in-law died, it was... No! Watch what you are saying My father-in-law and my mother-in-law So that's when we meet we can settle all our scores Are you threatening me while standing on the C4? No, this is not a threat, Rady this is a promise A promise? Best of luck I am sorry. I have to go now because my internet plan is about to expire - Don't move - What is it? Get me the fire extinguisher Get me the fire extinguisher! Is this the same perfume from this morning? - You will allow him to leave Sophia? - Sure I want him to get back to Egypt with what he took in one piece Call our men in Egypt and tell them to get ready Abu Anas! I was about to call you Who will pay for this delay, Ghazi? I will get to what we want in two days Too late I got a tip that you are being chased by Egyptians If they get any info the mission will be a bust If this happens, I will show you no mercy Get your money ready, Abu Anas I'll give you the location of the weapons in 48 hours What did you do to Rania, Younis? What will we do to get to the man behind Evan? What? Why are you saying "we"? We are not engaged by the way It was just a hug. You manage on your own If you need me, you how to reach me Goodbye, gorgeous See you later, tough guy - Bye, Ass'ad - Ass'ad? Thanks, sis - Yes, sir - Yes, Younis Take the first plane to Egypt Rady is behind all the hackings That's why his men were waiting for me I know. He left Bulgaria this morning Get back immediately Yes, sir - Ass'ad! - Yes - Give me a lift to the airport - Why? Stay a little longer "Cairo Airport - 9 a.m." Didn't I give you clear instructions about not using the help of anyone... - or not trusting anyone? - I had to, sir I had to do this to get to Rady Don't worry. She doesn't know anything about the data I took - This is her? - Yes She works with Jawad the one I told you about before Did you see him there? No - I decided to pull you out of this mission - What do you mean, sir? You are known now to Rady and others too Why are you treating me as a pawn you can move wherever you want? When I got back to working with you, I did it to get to Rady You got back because I wanted to We are doing a certain job not settling old scores What about my revenge? What about Reem and her family's revenge? I will have my revenge This is all that matters to me now I am doing this to protect you I am the one to say what matters and what doesn't We will get Rady - Omar, have Moustafa come? - Yes, I am on my way to him Work on the data that Younis got and once you reach something, tell me Tight the security on Younis and his family - What's wrong, Moustafa? - Activate the firewall quickly "The virus is injected successfully" Disconnect the server from the network quickly What's going on? The data Younis got has a virus The computer is hacked Some data was leaked for sure - Younis - My love - I've missed you - I've missed you Come in, Younis - How are you, Reem? - Come in till I pack Dida's bag Come How is the new game? Like I told you. It is getting harder and I gave up No, you can't give up It gets better when it gets harder - I was waiting for you, Mr. Younis - Mr. Younis? Okay Go help your mother. Go Hello - Yes, Younis, where are you? - Why do you ask? The drive you got had a virus We were hacked because of it Mr. Morad is dead Hello! Hello! Younis, answer me. Hello! What's wrong? - Get in Dida's room - What's wrong? Get in Dida's room There is no time for this - What's happening? Younis - Carry her Rady planned all this He knew I'd get out of my problem Mr. Morad knew that Rady was behind the hackings from the start He was sure that he'd target you The last thing he told me was to tighten the security on you and your family What is this, Younis? Can you explain to me what's happening? What do you do? The important thing is to get you and Farida to somewhere safe I won't leave my family's house before I know what is going on Mrs. Reem can I talk to you in private for a minute? If you don't mind Younis - You finish while I talk to your mom - Okay How could you live with me all this time without knowing anything about you? If I could tell you, I wouldn't hide it from you You are a liar and selfish You manipulated my life as you liked Is what that man said true? My parents died for... I couldn't look you in the eye and tell you it was because of me I left to protect you What happened then? I had the right to know to tell you that I didn't want to see you again You left me on my own and I had no one else but you I will never leave you again no matter what happens. I swear These are all the files that were copied from Rady's This is the file that had the names of the officers who were killed Other than that, there is nothing important aside from the virus that infected our server I copied all the files from his devices I am sure we will get something Search the logs The only link between the murdered officers and the names that were leaked is that they were close to the old Libyan regime They all stayed in Libya till the last minute before Gaddafi's downfall After that, they fled to Egypt, Turkey Iran, and Jordan and from there they traveled to other countries There is a stronger link between them The logs I could get to were private clouds Do you know what is in them? Hacking these clouds will take a very long time, Younis Cloud storage is protected against attacks It is very hard to crack Hard but not impossible, Moustafa We need to narrow down all the names from Rady's hack attempt - to know if there other Libyan officers - We are working on it Younis! These are all the files on this cloud Open this one IGLA is a kind of a man-portable shoulder-launched missile The Libyan army had massive numbers of it After the revolution, they only found 350 missiles A large number of them got to the hands of terrorist organizations They used to shoot down the Libyan army's aircrafts This means that Rady did this to know the location of these missiles for Abu Anas Exactly, sir We found a file on Rady's cloud called "IGLA's Burial" It had the names of all the assassinated officers There are other officers' names who must be responsible for hiding the missiles There you go They are searching for buried weapons after things got hard - How did Rady know this? - We don't know yet A piece of information like this can't reach individuals this easily There must be other organizations behind it We are certain that Rady or Ghazi's only mission is to get this piece of information Abu Anas can get the missiles out of Libya because he has massive control there They want to get them into Egypt for sure What are the names of the officers that were leaked from here? Rady took many names to hide his true intentions The only name that corresponds with the other names is Abdul Rahman El 'Leemy A former Libyan officer It seems he was one of the officers who buried the missiles He fled Libya after the revolution and came to Egypt Two years later, he went to Italy He lives in a town outside of Milan using an alias He doesn't have any current activities Omar, you have to get the rest of the names on the list Know their whereabouts quickly Younis will go after El 'Leemy You must get back to the mission We don't have time to get someone else to pick up from where you stopped Rady can't get to what he wants We can't let these missiles get trafficked to Egypt Morad wanted Rady alive, Younis Understood, sir "Province of Como, North Italy" It seems that Jawad pays you well Bravo! You know everything, right? It doesn't matter to me I don't care about knowing Why are you here? You are not going anywhere Younis! Get up Get up, Younis How did you get here? I was following the one you killed Unbelievable! Whenever I follow a lead you come and... Yes, Moustafa I sent you a number now I want its coordinates I don't have time for this, Moustafa Younis Sit down, Younis. It needs stitching - Stitching? - Yes, with surgical sutures Stitching with surgical sutures? Are you a doctor or what? We all become doctors in Syria after the war It is a small injury Apply some pressure Don't be afraid If I wanted to get rid of you I'd do it when you were on the floor - Why didn't you? - Because I don't want to get rid of you - You and I have the same purpose - Wake up! It is not the same I am defending my country You are a mercenary You can't judge me because you don't know anything about me I am protecting my family Things are inhumane in Rif Dimashq Governorate My father and brother died in the bombings Jawad got me, my sister, and my mother out in exchange for working for him We are now safe and sound outside of Syria If you don't know the meaning of a safe country that's because you have never been deprived of it You won't know the meaning of being safe and sound These two words mean everything If you are and Jawad are right then you know who is behind those attacks so we don't cooperate together? How? You are working against my country I have never worked against Egypt Assuming what you are saying is right after Jawad takes what he wants he will kill you You are a burned card, Maya By the way, my name is Sham You are better now Sham If you really want to do me a favor my socks were torn in the fight stitch them too. You are very skillful So aggressive! - Yes, Moustafa - Hello, Younis The phone was turned off half an hour ago in an area called Oria, near Como Where is Oria located? 20 minutes by car from your location I know it Bye, Moustafa I followed the accounts that used to transfer money to Evan These accounts are linked to a company's credit card The same accounts booked five tickets to Milan and booked hotel rooms I watched the hotel and followed them till we met here The company doesn't have any branch in Como - "Oria, Italy" - But it has properties One of them is in Oria overlooking the sea Who are you? So? Where are the missiles, Abdu? - What missiles are you talking about? - Right It is normal that you can't remember This happened many years ago Have you remembered? I will tell you everything I will tell you everything This is the place It is him Keep this with you, Younis How are you, Younis? How come you didn't thank me for the fire extinguishers I left there next to you? Why don't you order them to untie me and I will come to thank you myself? When I was in middle school I used to live in a city on the desert highway It was a nice and quiet place like this one right here It had only one problem Rats There were a lot of rats, Younis Each one of them was that big The Agricultural Center used to give the residents rat poison After a while, the rats got used to the poison They ate it without any problem, Younis It was almost like a dressing on a salad to them! - Can you imagine? They ate it - Bon appetite But what this story of salad got this to do with us? What did I do then? What did I do? I made traps, Younis I used plastic bottles in making them Do you know them? When any rat got in to eat... the trap locked it in I gathered the rats and drowned them in a water bucket and then I burned them Do you know what, Younis? I had never known that rats make sounds They were screaming so loudly while they were on fire After only two weeks... I didn't find a single rat in my house but they kept going to the neighbors' houses because they knew that going to a house I am in means torture The torture that can only end with death, Younis Had I known that this was your problem I'd have gotten you a cat Or I'd have asked one of my contacts to get you an exterminator company Enough talking about rats These two front teeth got longer You and Morad are like rats Burning you will make everyone stay away from me Do you like the situation you are in now? I want to ask you one question Why did you believe Morad and follow him? It is my job. Our country is full of filthy rats and needs cleaning! You have every right to live in a clean country, Younis You also have the right to... Tell me, Younis what is the meaning of a country? The place you were born in the place that gives you a passport or the place that puts food on your table? - I can't get this concept around my head - You will never do We are 100 million, so if there is a rotten one like you in every million the country won't be destroyed We will step on him and move on - Do they still fool you with this talk? - Yes I wanted to chat with you more but I don't want to delay your meeting with Morad How are you, Maya? Maya is better than many men - She played her part very well - Part? You don't know me I don't even know you But you know Jawad He speaks highly of you Don't give her that look, Younis She is a poor girl and Jawad played her But she is a very good and nice person You knew that yourself for sure I pity all the people who die because of you I won't spare you, Rady And I will never forget you, Younis Omar, I got half the coordinates for the location of the missiles What about the other half? It is either with Rady or he is still searching for it too Rady took a plane from Milan to Malaysia half an hour ago We got to the rest of the names on the list One of them is Nusair El Ahmady A former Libyan officer who lives there The first plane leaves in four hours "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia" Nusair has been here for five years He established a big contracting company He works with the major players in the country He lives alone His only son is called 'Oday He studies in Egypt His morning was very ordinary He didn't receive any strange calls Rady arrived this morning and checked in a very luxurious hotel He met with two men from the Chinese mafia The hotel is hosting a private party that will be attended by many VIPs When does this place close? Kiki, we will close in five minutes Isn't this a bit late? Glad to see you, Younis I am Ali - Nusair is on the party's guest list - Can we attend this party? Yo Sin! We booked a room for you in the hotel This is the invitation This laptop has the entire hotel system Go now, Yo Sin! I am busy I am busy - Ali, what do you do for a living? - A chef, as you can see So, Omar? What did you do about Nusair's son? 'We are locating his whereabouts as we speak - Tell me the updates - How is it going, Moustafa? "Sheikh Zayed, Cairo" I told Mr. Omar when he called me that I could kidnap Rady and then you'd come to take him from the fridge back there It is not that easy We want him to get what he wants and send it to his employers and get rid of all of them in one go Good thinking. Your tea What are you planning to do? I can't show my face at all If Rady finds out I am here the whole operation will be a bust The question is... what is Yo Sin doing here? - She is a chef - A chef? Really? - It doesn't seem that way - What did you think? Nusair is here Stay close to him Don't let him out of your sight Younis, they are coming your way Younis Nusair just received this message I forwarded it to you One Margarita, please I want you to forget about your son I don't want to ruin the party for you and this babe Who are you? And what do you want? I want the coordinates, Nusair I'll be with you shortly What coordinates? You are talking about something I don't know Just some numbers... you have them and I want them I'll take them for sure, Nusair You don't know who I am I can lock you up in this country forever Why do they say that kids are the most precious thing in the world? Or don't you want to see your son again? - Now, Omar - Okay, Younis. The team is ready "Sheikh Zayed, Cairo" Easy, man! Do you think he is a human sacrifice? Younis, he escaped from the back door - Who are you? - Don't worry. Your son is fine Right is obvious and wrong is obvious God is Greatest God is Greatest - Where are you going? - Do you know where the toilet is? Man down Ali, don't let Rady get out of the hotel Consider it done, Younis You stabbed me, you bastard What is the situation report, Omar? Rady got the coordinates and sent them to Abu Anas, sir If Abu Anas gets to these missiles before us we will be done for He could traffic them to our country Where is Younis? The 15th floor, Younis So I come all this way for you and you leave me and go? You are too late, Younis You are always too late Don't worry. This time I promise you we won't leave each other again "Our country Egypt, our home May God protect it" You said, we are 100 million, so if there a rotten one like you in every million we will step on him and move on Who is being stepped on now, Younis? What could I say? You love this That's what you are all about Unfortunately, my orders say I have to bring back alive But the one who wanted you alive is dead Mr. Omar, congrats The groom went on his honeymoon Did he commit suicide or did someone pushed him? God! "Western Sahara March 2019" "Breaking news" "Major land-to-air missiles trafficking attempt blocked at the Egyptian borders" It is your decision Knowledge has a price Turn this thing off, Younis Food is getting cold - Let him watch - Sometimes the price is very high - I will use his laptop - Dida, if you touch it... But you have to know that your ability to get the information can either start a war or end it "Cairo Airport, 8 p.m. Budapest flight" "You will receive the operation details there"
