- Is this seat occupied? - I'm afraid this cabin is reserved... - And should have been locked. - The door was open. - May I? - What do you want? I'm looking for a place to stretch out my leg. I beg your pardon! You can't just... I'm an invalid. May I? - Please keep your seat. - Thank you. Very kind. The fishing tackle. Check. Shirts... 3 shirts. I'm wearing one. Check. Socks... 6 pair. 5 spares. I'm wearing one pair. Check The woolen waistcoat for cold mountain weather. Yes. Check. - Heider?slein? - Hm? - Where are my thick underpants? - In the brown leather bag. - Just don't call me Heider?slein! - Why not? You've always been my Heider?slein during the honeymoon. That was 20 years ago. Now it sounds silly. But today I'm honeymooning again. Today we go on a journey. I brought something nice. Cheese, butter, sardines. Are you trying to offend me? I can catch my own sardines. You catch more than that, Daddy. Murderer's. - Ready. Everything's done! Beer loaded. - All of it? - Yes! - Thank you. - 3 crates of delicious Pils? - Yes. 4 crates, just in case. 4 crates of beer! What's with you? Don't be so excited! What a picture! Daddy standing in the drink... 4 crates of beer under water, ice-cold and every now and then... glug,glug,glug... - You'll be forever a big boy! - That must be my profession. The police officer always has the finger on the trigger. But today we go on a journey. On a journey! - Commissioner Lohmann's. - I've already gone... - It's Voss. He says it's urgent. - When I have plans... Hello Voss! What is it? What? Where did you say? - Morning. - Morning. A horrible thing. I'm afraid it won't be difficult for you to identify the victim. I know. - The briefcase is missing. - I'm sure it is. - What was in it? - Incriminating evidence. - To put somebody away. - Probably the Chicago syndicate. What? Colonel Haag from Interpol. He suspected that the crime syndicate of Chicago tried to contact a local crime organization. He believed, he's found a lead. Must have been the right lead. Between us, I've received a telegram from the FBI. The syndicate's sent a woman to Europe. - A woman? - Yes. A Miss Pizarro. We have her picture. There is a man who should know more about her. I can visit him without notice. - Good morning! - Director Wolf. It's a great pleasure, Commissioner. - I've always wanted to meet you. - Likewise. 2 years I've been trying. After all I'm the man... who sends you all the guests. Without me you could close your hotel. Nice collection. Yes, really well-crafted sculptures. Replicas of the biggest mass murderers of our time. - I want them always in front of me. - Really? They provide me with the hardness necessary in my profession. - Cigar? - No. Thank you. Please have a seat. How can I help you? I want to speak to one of your regular guests. Alberto Sandro, life sentence. Alberto Sandro? Let me think... Yes! He's here. Section D, Number 736. Life imprisonment for being a contract killer. Belonged to the syndicate. I believe they could prove it without a doubt. This syndicate is a goddamn thing. A syndicate of gigantic proportions. Situated in Chicago. A huge spider web. If you grab it... you get sticky fingers. You have to grab the spider, Commissioner! Not the web. I'll call Sandro for you. He works as a trusty in our pharmacy. I didn't think he was capable of doing something like that. Section D. Please give me B?hmler. Wolf speaking. There is a visitor for Alberto Sandro. Put him on his feet and send him to me right away. Yes! I'll send him right away. Sandro! You are asked to the director's office. Do you hear me? You are asked to the director's office. Come on. Take off your jacket. Sleeve up. Put your arm on the table. That's what she looks like. Interesting lady. Right. To me she is of interest. - Yes? - Ah! There he is. Come on in. Come closer. - Well Sandro. Do you remember me? - Yes, Mr. Lohmann. I have a single question but I want a clear answer. Yes, Mr. Lohmann. Be assured, Commissioner, Sandro is one of our most good-natured prisoners. I'm sure he's glad to be of help. Isn't that right, my son? - Yes! - Have you seen this woman before? - This woman? - Yes... this woman. She's approaching the Bimbo Bar. - Good evening, Mrs. Pizarro. - Where are you? Everywhere. I've been watching you since your arrival. - So has Interpol. - You mean Colonel Haag? One of you leaked information, but we have the files. You have...? - We make short shrift. - Where's your partner? - I don't know. Nobody knows the other party. I'm afraid I don't negotiate with you alone. - What are you saying? - As long as your partner isn't here, nothing. Good night, Mrs. Pizarro. I'll follow her as soon as she comes out. There she is. Over. No! - Something's happened over there. - What's going on? A woman burned to death. Something terrible has happened. Let me through. - Hot stuff, Boss. - It certainly is. Have you seen everything? Everything and nothing. They escaped quickly. It's obvious. Mrs. Pizarro and Colonel Haag have been killed by the same man. For the same reason. - To keep the secret of the two powerful. -The two powerful? Yes. Yes, one being the Chicago syndicate... and the other... - Commissioner Lohmann? - Busy. - I'm from the press. - Then even more. The public wants to be informed. - How old are you? - Of age. - Best age for getting children. - I beg your pardon? - Can you cook? - Yes. I have to decline your proposition. Well, what's happened here? Nothing that's suitable for young girls. - It's murder. - Aha. After all. - Thank you. - What? Why? That's all I wanted to know. Clever person. I put my foot in my mouth, there. Excuse me, where can I make a phone call? - At my place if you like. - Do you live here? Not far away. 15 minutes by taxi maybe. - Sorry, I have another profession. - Watch out. Thank you. - I... - It's okay. You're a journalist. - That's fraud. - What do you mean? You spark deceitful hopes. Such legs. And such a serious profession. - I use my legs for walking. - Wait a moment. I could tell you some things. - Are you an...? - ... eye witness. I saw everything. While I was playing I suddenly saw a fire. - A fire? Like this one? - Hey, aren't you blind. - Fire is hot. - Your name? - Heiper. Are you really blind? Of course, otherwise I wouldn't have papers. Well, then tell us what you heard last night. - I heard footsteps. - You hear footsteps all day long. They were different. As if it has been a man with a wooden leg. - And... - And what? And then? Go on. - The click-clock passed and? - That's all. - You wanted to say something. - I have nothing more to say. Aha. Sudden memory loss. - Take him in for interrogation. Maybe he'll talk tomorrow. - Yes. Follow me. Watch out. Always the same. The witness becomes afraid when it starts to get interesting. Well, not exactly much about Mrs. Pizarro. - What was in the bag? - Nothing important. Lipsticks, Kleenex, a book. I can do without the Kleenex, but the book, give it to me. "The devil's anatomy. Criminal instincts of men" by Father Dr. H. Briefenstein. The devil's anatomy... Perfect title for sleepless nights. - Well then. Till tomorrow, Voss. - Till tomorrow, Boss. I have to know where he's heading to. I know exactly where he's heading to. To the Bimbo Bar. You seem to know everything. - Just professional experience. - What's your profession? It depends... come on! I know how to get to the bar without getting seen. Police. This woman was here between 8:30 and 9 o'clock. - Do you remember? - No. Wait... Yes. She was here. At 9 o'clock. Just made a call. - And then she left? - Yes, she left. - Without meeting anybody? - Not that I know of? Gimme a beer. - You were right. He's here. - Yes. I hope he comes out again. You are scary. You are... - ... dangerous. - I've already killed lots of women. - So? - And why? - They were too nosy. Don't worry. When it comes to you I lack courage. - Who are you? - Joe Como. Journalist? - You aren't here by accident. - I am. You aren't here by accident yourself, are you? - Miss? - Sabrehm. - Maria Sabrehm. - Thank you. Can you believe this Lohmann? Sits there drinking a beer. Unbelievable! Beer calms you down. He'll need to be calm later on. Why? Why are you interested in this case, Maria? Now it's you who's nosy. - Damn. Any other place where I can make a call? - Over there. Here. - He's coming. - Back. What's going on? It looks like something really struck him. One beer hasn't been enough. - Now he's mistaken. That's wrong. - You understand what he's saying? I read his lips. That's wrong. - The man he's talking about is dead. - Dead? - Who? - It's better you don't ask. - But... - Our Lohmann is over-worked. He's started seeing ghosts. He going inside. - Everything's done. I filed the death case. - Which one? Who are you? What do you want? - I want to talk to Father Briefenstein. - This late? There are no visiting hours for midwives and police officers. - Please go wake the Father. - Not necessary. Good evening. Briefenstein. I'm still up as you can see. Commissioner Lohmann. Are the parish's troubles keeping you awake? Tomorrow's Friday. Distribution of the pauper relief. Everybody must get their money. - As with soldiers. - I beg your pardon? I meant as within any good organization. - Take that with you. - Of course. My poor need help. And you, Commissioner? - Information. - About what? - About "The Devil's Anatomy". - Ah, my book! - It's found a reader after all. - A very truth-hungry one. Please tell me, Father... If the devil's a ghost... - how can he have an anatomy? - Due to incarnation. My chapter about the werewolf myth proves that. Well, I'm more interested in the ... Mabuse myth. Do you think Dr. Mabuse could be still alive? Every ghost's immortal. The name Mabuse is the incarnation of exceptional crimes. Power is the goal. Megalomania the driving force. That's what my gut tells me. A desire to impose his will, devilish will on the world. Tell me, Commissioner, how did you come upon my book? I found it in the hand bag of a murder victim. That's why I'm here. Do you know this woman? - I've never seen her. - Never been in your church? Not that I know. But I'll pray for her soul. What's that? He mustn't do that! Excuse me for a moment. - What was that? - Maria, stay here. Father! - What was that explosion? - I don't know. What's happened? - I caught the wrong ball. - You must have powerful enemies... that dare pursue you into a church. - I'll get the doctor. - I prefer a drink. - Me too. - You again? What are you doing here? I know the lady. I'm her pastor. She needs something different from pastoring. - Right. She needs me. - Who are you? You'll know in a moment. Follow me. I have to talk to you in private. - Have you seen him? - Yes. He works incessantly. A person obsessed... - who's ingenious brain only knows one thing. - When can I see him? You have to be patient, Maria. I sent you the telegram. - You are...? - Como. Joe Como, FBI. - It was you who announced this Pizarro. - Yes. Unfortunately too late, Como. You're in a bad place, Commissioner. Right between the crime syndicate and the phantom. Right. I have to find it. Leave it, Lohmann. The one who looks for me will find death. Where's Briefenstein? Hello. Hello, do you hear me? Well? - What are you doing there? - You asked for a drink. This is a very old Remy Martin. You have to keep something like this behind locked doors. What's with you, Commissioner? - Have you seen ghosts? - I heard a voice, but... - it was not the holy ghost. - But? It came from the speaker that transmits the sermon. But there's nobody on the pulpit. Well, this nobody spoke. Hello? Do you hear me? Answer. - What do you have to say? - My name is Nick Scappio. Contact man of the Chicago syndicate... and partner of the late Mrs. Pizarro. - I know. - To the police I am Joe Como, FBI. - My papers are shipshape. - Good. What does Chicago say? The syndicate accepts your offer under one condition. What condition? Proof of your power as an equal partner. They are on the gallery! Stop that at once. Don't you like it? I want to know what you were looking for up here? The same as you. The source of the mysterious voice. There is another microphone on the gallery for solos. - How do you know that? - I'm a member of the church choir. - Take the girl home. - With pleasure. - Thank you very much! - I'll see you tomorrow. Is it possible that the devil comes to your church for prayers? The devil doesn't pray. He wants to be worshipped. - Good morning, Commissioner. - Morning. - Morning, Commissioner. - Morning. Well? Where have you been last night? St. Thomas Church, to atone for my sin. I was on my way to you, here. - What's that? - Heiper's statement. Oh, our blind guy. Anything new? No, he sticks to yesterday's statement. I want to talk to him. - Talk to him? - Damn, I've already let him go! - What?!? It made no sense to keep him any longer. - He had nothing more to add. - Had nothing? Didn't want to! He's admitted that a man with a leg prosthesis - passed by before the murder occurred... - There are millions of handicapped people. Leg prosthesis was the word that silenced him! It slipped out of his mouth. Suddenly he fell silent, as if somebody warned him. Who could have warned him? You did Pizarro's murderer a great favor. That's almost criminal... to let the blind man go! Well, I did it out of sympathy. It's Friday today. He wanted to collect his benefits. - Don't say from Father Briefenstein. - That's right. My car. Voss! I hope, you're just and idiot and not a criminal. - You suspect me? - In this case everybody's a suspect. Tom Hallmann. Recommended by district office 17. - Here my son. - Thank you! Thank you very much! Hanna Schreiber. Recommended by district office 9. - Here, my dear woman. - God may bless you. Take this as well. It contains good food. Thank you! Thank you! Anton Heiper, blind accordionist. Recommended by district office 17. We know each other. How are you, my friend? - I live, as long as people let me. - Who would keep you from it? Here. Your weekly allowance. An extra benefit. A bible in Braille. - No snuff for me? - Oh! We have that, too. Thank you very much, Father! Fritz Gerber, maimed. Recommended by district office 17. - What just happened? - He's dead! Hurry, follow the truck! That was murder. - This way? - Right there. No! I need him alive. Alberto Sandro. Watch out! That's it my friend. Now I want to know how he got out. Can't wait to hear what Wolf has to say about this. Oh, of course. I will be glad to answer all your questions. But unfortunately I don't know what you are talking about. Since my visit yesterday two murders have been committed. And one of them by a man I visited here yesterday. - Alberto Sandro? - Life sentence, yes. But it didn't stop him from brutally killing a blind beggar at St. Thomas church today. That's impossible. I would've been informed about his escape immediately. Yeah, well I have some news for you then. Alberto Sandro is sitting in the police prison right now. It must be a mistake. Section D, please. Mr. B?hmler? A visitor for Alberto Sandro. Send him up immediately. Oh, thank you. He didn't feel well last night, he got an injection and now he is asleep. - Well, then we go to see him. - As you wish. This is Mr. B?hmler, supervisor of section D. Commissioner Lohmann. - I want to see Alberto Sandro. - Please... Please, see for yourself. Yes, I see someone lying there. I want to see his face. Open the cell! I can't wait to find out how you can be in two jails at the same time. - But this is... - Of course it's not Sandro. - This is Dimitrios the Greek. - 10 years for armed robbery. - And he is dead. - He is dead? Strangled. He probably knew too much. - Mr. B?hmler, how could this happen? - I... I can't explain it either. One moment please. - How did Sandro get out of here. - Only he will be able to tell us. He must've killed him. Attention! Attention! This is director Wolf speaking. Immediate orders for everyone. Highest alert level! Double the guards! Secure exits! Isolate all sections! All workshops under severe control! I have to thank you commissioner. Without you I might have found out too late that the supervision of section D isn't sufficient yet. Are you saying I'm responsible? You are the supervisor of section D, Mr. B?hmler! Gentlemen, please. We'll find out whose fault it is later. - Where did Dimitrios work? - In the laundry room. I want to see it. Let's go. That's some impressive machinery. We wash for hospitals, orphanages and some private businesses. We also wash the towels for the police. And the transport is with big trucks I suppose? Yes, we have some of those. And was Dimitrios able to drive with his leg prosthesis? He only accompanied the driver. His job was to check on the daily delivery of the laundry. Sounds right. A witness at the crime scene heard someone walk around with a leg prosthesis. So you think that convicts can just walk out of here, commit a crime and then just come back here? I don't want to suggest that. But they leave with the clean laundry and come back with the dirty. - Commissioner Lohmann, telephone. - Who is it? - The call is coming from outside. - Just a moment please. - Lohmann. - My pleasure. - Hello, who is this? - The voice from yesterday. I'm warning you, Lohmann. You are going too far and it wouldn't be good for you. - I still need you. - Hello! Hello! - Where is B?hmler? - On inspection. - Why? Bad news, Commissioner? - Oh, quite the opposite. Someone is concerned about my future. Do you really trust this guy B?hmler? Until now he had never made any mistakes. His background is flawless in any respect. He has always been absolutely reliably and loyal. Loyal. To whom? You or Dr. Mabuse? What are you saying, commissioner. Dr. Mabuse is dead. Sometimes the dead come back. How can a mortal soul cheat death? How can man be reborn? We who have the faith my beloved sisters and brothers, we know the answer. Because the lord says: Have faith and you will be blessed. Hello? Oh, Maria. No, No. I just recorded my Sunday speech on tape. I'm sorry to disturb you but do you have a message for me? We must have patience, Maria. Wait until it's time. May God be with you. Maria, why so worried all of a sudden? Please trust me and tell me. That's very considerate of you but I can't. - Oh, look at this. - We were waiting for you. We started wondering if they kept you in jail. Wouldn't have surprised me. Where is Voss? - He's speaking with Sandro. - And why didn't he wait for me? Professor Griesinger is with him, too. You wait here. This is not ready for the press yet. - Why not? - He's right. This is nothing for you. Wait at the Hildebrandt across the street. What's the matter with him, Professor? Weird. He must be under the influence of an unknown drug that paralyzes the mind without hindering the bodily functions. - Like a sleepwalker. - Or zombies. - Zombies? - Dead people who follow the calls of wizards. - A Caribbean superstition. - But he is alive. Yes, but his willpower has died. So he is the tool of another willpower then. - It looks like it. - Reflexes are normal. No mental reaction. Sandro has become an obedient machine that executes orders without thinking. - Including murder. - Right. And that's where the big danger is. because if this poison were to get in the hands of a big criminal organization, they could rule the world one day. Professor, can a poison kill your inner self to replace it with another inner self? If I remember correctly a biochemist did successful experiments with a drug that turned the addict into a slave of someone else?s mind. - So it's possible. - What was his name? I can't remember his name but I read an article about him somewhere. - Did he wake up. - No, he has received pulses. - From whom? His master? - Are you saying he is among us? Yes. I understand. I'm ready. - As if he is answering someone. - Must be some kind of radio connection. I'm waiting. - Here it is. A receiver. - Hello Lohmann. Do you realize that I'm everywhere and that my orders are being followed. See for yourself. Sandro, show him. Go. Watch out! - What happened? - Isn't that the prisoner. What just happened? - There is someone lying on the street. - An accident. Block off the street immediately. Keep the people away. ...he must've fallen out the window ... he looks terrible ...let me through ... his skull... - It's hard to believe he's still alive. - Can he be saved? No, his blood isn't clotting. Like a hemophiliac. Hemophilia... it was in the article. Synthetic narcotics can cause this blood disease. Can you prove that without any doubts? Dead. The autopsy will prove it. Oh, and now I remember the name. The article was written by Professor... Oh my God, Professor. Revolver with a silencer. Dead! Where can the bullet have come from. It must've come from over there. A Barricade around the whole block! - Hello. - Maria. - Who was the other? - The other what? - Whose second glass is this? - It's mine. I had two martinis, why? - Someone just got murdered. - Oh my God. You are saying Professor Giesinger has... Unfortunately I can only tell you what I think... He was looking for a synthetic drug in the blood. - Where is the new one? - Alberto Santoro, here. No, excuse me. The body is in the washing room. He was in a terrible condition. Come with me. Concentrated sulfuric acid. The autopsy was supposed to show the proof but he crossed us. - Who? - That is a good question, Doctor. - Was someone here after his arrival? - No, Commissioner. - Are you sure. - I sat at the entrance, no one came in. Only the laundry people to change the body's sheets. - From what company? - Where we do all our laundry. - At the prison. - The prison. Yes, how can I help you? Commissioner Lohmann sent me, just in case your phone is being tapped. - Tapped by who? - That he will tell you himself. He is asking you to come to his office, alone. No one shall find out about this visit. Commissioner Lohmann is overly afraid. I recognized that on his last visit. But if that's what I wants I'm coming. Cigar? No, thanks. Goodbye. - Who was that? - A certain Voss from the police. And what did he want? - Commissioner Lohmann wants me to see him at the station for a secret meeting. - So you think my life is in danger? - I'm afraid so. I'm suspecting that criminal elements are using your prison as a shelter. Well, I think that's what prisons are for. I mean that a group has become 'independent'. In section D. No offense but since Sandro's escape you've been obsessed with this idea. I wish I were wrong but in your own interest I'm asking you to take the following precautions: A) Watch out for B?hmler. B) Take an inventory of the drugs in your pharmacy. And C) Check the laundry so that no one can be smuggled onto the truck. And of course the most important thing, never go into section D alone! Thank you very much but I really hope that you are wrong. But nevertheless I can assure you that I will follow all your instructions. Thank you. Are you sure that no one has seen you? I like to believe that with this coat and this hat no one can recognize me. - Goodbye Commissioner. - Goodbye, - don't forget your cane. - Thank you. - Here is the report about Sandro's suicide. - Put it on my desk. - I've sent a telegram to the F.B.I. in Washington. - Why? This Joe Como had two whiskeys at the hotel bar last night. I took the glasses and checked the fingerprints. They don't match with the ones in his passport. - Really. I hope you don't mind me just doing it. If you are so efficient what do you think of Wolf then? I don't know. The director of a prison as the boss of a crime syndicate. I know it's a grotesque idea but I don't like this guy Wolf. - Let's him put under observation. - Ok, boss. What was that? I think an observation is no longer needed. It is my sad duty to inform you that our honored director, and forever unforgettable director, Wolf, has been killed in a criminal attack. Until a successor has been found I will take over the prison. I expect everyone to do their duty as usual. And that the work in all the workshops is continued. The instructions for the several sections are the same. - At your service, Doctor. - The time has come, B?hmler. The syndicate has agreed to distribute our drugs in the U.S.A. and wherever they are present. But the fools want proof of the dreadful power our drug has. They shall get this proof. I will bring fear and loathing all over this town. Enforce section D. We will attack on Friday the 13th. - Friday the 13th? - I love days with bad luck. They give me good luck. At 9:00PM sharp take over the power station and blow up the nuclear plants. This will be enough. And something else. Avoid at all costs that Maria Sabrehm sees her father. Should she do so she will have to be eliminated. I understand. Mabuse. Mabuse. I can't catch a phantom! If this phantom is alive. I don't know if he is alive. I only know that he agitates. He's robbing people of their will power with the help of a drug someone unknown to us has invented. - Giesinger knew his name. - Yes, but he died before he could tell us. But he said something about an article this scientist had written. Probably in a medical journal. We have to find this article. You want to see the Pharmacological Observer? Yes, from the last five years. Weird, no one has asked for it in years but now you are the second person in 30 minutes. - Who was the other person? - I only saw the book card. Someone in the reading room. - I'm arresting you. - Commissioner Lohmann. Cutting out pages of library books is destruction of public property. Synthetic Narcotics and the Me-Central of the nerve system? From Professor Julius Sabrehm? Aren't you Maria Sabrehm? - Yes, I'm his daughter. - Interesting. And what do you want to do with this? - I got a call... - ... from your father? No, in the name of my father. - The article I should... - ... destroy! - Did you recognize the voice? - No. - Where is your father? - In jail. - What? - Five years for espionage. But he wasn't a spy. Secret documents were stolen in the chemical factory he was working at. He was innocent but got connected to the affair. My father is innocent. I know it. When was the last time you saw your father? On the day he went to prison, two years ago. - You've never visited him? - No, he refused to see anyone. But the voice told me to wait until the day comes. - What day? - Friday the 13th. Dr. Mabuse, I know you are here. What shall I report to Chicago? Nick Scappio. Tell your syndicate in Chicago that I will prove my power on the night of Friday the 13th. Ok, I will send a telegram this evening. - Something else, keep Maria out of this. - Meaning what? That means that I will control her. I'm Maria Sabrehm. The daughter of Julius Sabrehm. - I want to visit my father. - I'm sorry, but the prisoner Sabrehm is not seeing any visitors. - Not even his own daughter? - No exceptions. I have the right to examine him at any given time, even in the presence of his daughter. Here, the court order. If you think that an examination is absolutely necessary, please. - But isn't that... - Father Briefenstein. Our prison clergyman. That's a good coincidence. I have something to take care of. Father Briefenstein will show you the way. - He is the clergyman of your father. - And of the daughter. - Oh God, how practical. - You'll excuse me then. Good bye. - Father. - What a surprise. - Can I see my father. - Please follow me. - He doesn't know he is in jail. - Where else then? In a chemical laboratory. They have made a lab for him. He has erased the outer world. He has turned from a philanthrope to a misanthrope. - It doesn't sound very Christian. - It was the shock of the unfair sentence. - Professor. - Leave me alone. - Father. - Who is the girl? - Don't you recognize me? - I don't know anyone. - I'm Maria. - I'm warning you! In this glass there is a very dangerous substance - Maybe sulfuric acid? - Nitroglycerine. - Who is this man? - Police. - Police? - Yes, police! You arrested me although I was innocent. You delivered wrong evidence. You destroyed my old life and now you want to destroy the new one as well. I only want to know one thing Professor Sabrehm. Have you really lost your mind or are you just acting? God gives the nuts but he doesn't crack them open. - Father! - Stop! Or I'll smash the glass. - No. - Let me go. Father, for God's sake. Excuse me, it was my mistake to insist on this visit. I think the Professor needs to rest. I'll stay with him if you don't mind. Here, take a seat. - He didn't recognize me. - Maybe he did. Sit down. Sit down. Maria, what does the sentence "God gives the nuts, but he doesn't crack them open. " mean? That's what my father used to tell me all the time - since I was a child. - Then it was message. - Do you believe my father... - ... listen, Maria. Your father isn't suffering from a shock. He is under a secret spell. He wasn't supposed to recognize you, but now I know that he did. And I will do everything to get him out of there. - Good evening! - You? Yes. Or are you expecting someone else? What are you thinking. I know, my behavior is unbelievable but I have a good excuse. I'm crazy. - Please go. - No, I'm not that crazy. - At least turn around. - Well... No problem. - How did you get in here? - Through the door. - Do you have a key? - Opening doors is part of my job. It's about time you tell me what your job is. - May I turn around? - Yes. I want to whisper it in your ear. Quiet and tender. Get out now. Immediately. I don't have male visitors in my bedroom at this hour. You are absolutely right. What are you doing? Done. Now we are in the living room. Come, let's take a seat on the couch. In America it's the classic place for love. One sits down, puts the arm around her shoulder, - looks into her eyes. - Not only in America. Right, at this point it becomes international. - Who is that? - Joe Como you are under arrest. What's this silly joke about, Voss? This is not a silly joke but an order from Commissioner Lohmann. That's something different then. I'm sorry, but that's part of my job, too. Let's go. Can I speak to Commissioner Lohmann please. Not until tomorrow? But I must! Ok. I'll come tomorrow then. I'm sorry but I have to put a man in jail. Someone who is reliable and can tell me what is going on in section D. But I'm totally unreliable, you better let me go. Impossible. I have a great reason to arrest you. I received a message from Washington. You are not Joe Como from the F.B.I., you are Nick Scappio from the notorious crime syndicate from Chicago. I wonder who told you that. My papers are in order. Oh, they are excellent but the finger prints don't match the name. - May I ask for your hand. - You are strange. - Maybe. - I don't quite understand you. You know everything but send me to jail as a middleman. Why? You are the criminal I trust. I'm giving you a chance. You will get the necessary instructions. Too bad. I'd have preferred a nice evening with Maria. By the way, how long do I have to stay in prison? Until Friday the 13th. Move, now. No, no... Yes, come in. I don't understand this, she must come home at some point. - Who? - Maria Sabrehm, I'm trying to get hold of her for the last 4 hours. Here, the telegram from the F.B.I.. I have decoded it. Finger prints are false on purpose. Joe Como one of our best agents. Uses the name Nick Scappio who was previously arrested. - Did you expect anything else? - Well, I don't know. My dear Voss, after a couple of years you will be able to tell a criminal from a policeman. - Maybe. - I hope he is successful. - Lohmann. - Why don't you go fishing, Lohmann? The weather is good, life is good. I'm giving you a last chance. - What, I can barely understand you. - I repeat, I give you a last chance. - The last what? - You've understood me perfectly. Think about it, Lohmann. Mabuse? I know where the guy was calling from. Come with me. - Is the boss here? - Upstairs, I'll call him. Stay here. Backdoor. Come in Lohmann. I've been expecting you. I knew that the piano would bring you here. Close the door. Stay where you are. - You want to give me a last chance? - Yes, I do. I want to buy you. - How much? - Let's say 10.000.000? - I have refused bigger offers. - You have? When I was still a young cop someone wanted to bribe me with 1.000 DM. And you call that more money? For 1.000 I can buy myself a new fishing rod or a new hat for my wife. - But 10.000.000 is nothing. - So you refuse. This means the end of being considerate of you. Now it's about who pulls it out faster. - The sexton. - Well done, Lohmann. The sexton was my voice but he knew too much. This time I used the police to get rid of him. Thank you for the favor, Lohmann. - Stop it, Voss. It's me. - Oh, it's you Commissioner. I came over the fire stairs and through the window I thought you were Mabuse. Mabuse, no. But at least now I know who stepped into his footsteps. Call 32-9-55. 32-9-55 stand still. 32-9-55 go to the pharmacy. - Why was he brought here? - His papers are in the name of Bob Arco. Robbery. 10 years. He was brought here yesterday. - Transferred from Rotwall prison. - Thank you. There you are. What's this masquerade about, Nick Scappio? - Dr. Mabuse. - Answer me. I'm glad I get to talk to you. - Lohmann the fool wants me to spy around. - Huh. - But don't worry. I'm your man. - If you know what's good for you. - By the way Dr... - What else? Chicago is still waiting for the proof of your power. I will prove it. You stay here. You will get further instructions. - What do you say now B?hmler? - I don't know. Can we trust him? What a stupid question. We will know after the first injection. You want to... Of course, we'll put him with the others. We don't need him any longer. NO ENTRY Is anybody there? God gives the nuts, but he doesn't crack them open. This saying shall... We are being taped. But this will overwrite our voice. This saying shall prove that I came as a friend. Only my daughter can have told you about that. You are right. Because of me Maria is living in the shadow of Mabuse. Who is Mabuse? - Me. - You? Yes, me. I'm the power behind him. Without my formula he could never reach his final goal. That's why he got me caught up in that spy case. - And now you are helping him? - I have to. He threatened to kill Maria if I don't help him. - But where is Mabuse? - Here, it's his jail. - Here, take that. It's an antidote. - Against what? All prisoners of section D get an injection. A drug that turns you into a blind robot. - And if I don't let them give me an injection? - Then they will kill you. The antidote pills don't dissolve in the mouth. Keep them ready and bite on them when they give you an injection. - Can you act? - Yes, why? You have to act like the injection is working. Something else, call the police if you can. Friday the 13th is a false date. Mabuse is the devil, he can strike anytime. You have to leave now. No one must find out that you were here. Thank you. - So, did you settle in yet? - Well, it's not exactly ideal. The transition isn't easy. Now I recognize you. it was at church. No, I think you are mistaken. I have never seen you before. - My name is Bob Arco. - Please, there is no need for that. I know what's going on. You are Joe Como, Maria's friend. I don't know a Maria. I just wanted to see her father. Maria has disappeared. - What are you saying? - Disappeared. - Maybe even taken hostage. - By who? - By Mabuse to blackmail her father. - Nonsense. Don't call the ghosts. As a man of God you shouldn't be afraid of ghosts. Or are you afraid of yourself? - 32-9-55 you are being vaccinated. - I'm against it. Even as a child I was against vaccinations. Don't tell any stories. Take off your jacket and roll up your sleeves. Ok, then. What is it for? Typhus or cholera? For everything. Take the jacket! Out! Lights out. We are ready. The square on the map goes around the power station. The circles show the cable crossroads. There we will dig open the asphalt so that the cables can be cut through as soon as possible. This will make the attack on the nuclear plants easier. - 32-9-55. - Here. - Go with group L. - I'm going with group L. To avoid suspicion the work on the cable crossroads will look like random road work. Get inside. Faster. You see that. A construction area with no light. Greatest danger for the city. Contact Commissioner Lohmann immediately! Attack on power stations and nuclear plants possible at any time. Lookout Number 98 is ready. Receiving station Number 1 in contact. Commotion at police headquarters. Lohmann and his people in night meeting. - Thank you, over. - Could be a coincidence, B?hmler. Lohmann is always busy but maybe he did find out something. From who? Who could've... - Did Nick Scappio get his injection? - Three in a row. He is completely under control and not able to have any personal feelings or for any initiative. We have to be absolutely sure. I'll test him. - 32-9-55. 32-9-55 answer. - Here. The cell door is open. Go to the laundry room. I'm going to the laundry room. Turn on the control screen. We will find out if he is able to have any personal feelings or not. Walk inside the side room. Turn on the light. - Joe! Joe! Help me. - Maria! Maria what have they done to you? So, after all. You have blown your cover, Joe Como! Alias Nick Scappio, alias Bob Arco. And you yourself, are a traitor . There is death for treason! What is he going to do? What does it all mean? We're gonna get out of here. We must get out of here! We can't afford to have such losers. You're an amateur B?hmler! Do you even know if Nick Scappio brought us the real message from Chicago? No, I don't know. But Mrs. Pizarro is dead. But we can still cancel the whole operation. Nonsense. I have a direct message from overseas. They want proof of our power and they shall have it. And if Nick Scappio betrayed us? He only knows that we are going to attack on Friday the 13th but we will do it today. We are attacking the power station and the nuclear plant directly. Alarm section D and turn on the machines. I'll alarm section D and turn on the machines. I have only one lord and ruler, Dr. Mabuse. Maybe I can break down the wall with this. Hello, Voss? Can you hear me? How are things at your end? We are ready. But so far there is nothing suspicious. - There is a steel wall. - Oh my God. All arterial roads have been blocked off. That's good. Thank you. Why don't we just attack the prison? I don't want to grab the cobweb, I want the spider! And I have to get it out first. - They're coming. - There they are. I have only one lord and ruler, Dr. Mabuse. Give it to me. Stop! Stop! No further step forward! - Surrender! Or we will open the fire! - They are not reacting. Warning shot! Fire! Something is going on. Something went wrong! It must not go wrong! We have to go there immediately. My car is bullet proof, we'll take Sabrehm with us. - There, steel as well. - I don't want to die. No! No! - What kind of pipe is this? - What are you doing? Maybe it's a gas pipe. That could still save us. Gas! No, you can't do this! No! No! No! - Hurry up. - Mabuse. No, I haven't done anything. No! No! - It's gas. Can you dive? - Yes, why? A gas explosion may blast open the door. Get under water now. There,over there! The bastards. Get in the car. Hurry! Take over the prison with your men! Start the car. Where is my father? Please, where is my father? I wanted to help him. Mabuse took him. Voss I need your car. Mabuse escaped with Sabrehm. - Go with him. My car is right outside. - I'm coming with you. There they are! Too late, leave him there. Take care of B?hmler! Father! Father! Stop! What are you doing here? Stop or I'll shoot! Hands up! Don't move! And now my friend, you'll show me your face. That's what I thought. Prison director Wolf as successor of Dr. Mabuse. Very surprised, huh? Prison director Wolf died in front of your eyes. Right. I saw his car explode and his hat and coat burn. That one of his senseless victims had to wear. Good guess, Lohmann. But you are still wrong. Believe me, you've never met prison director Wolf. I had to get rid of him way before that to take his place. Because not even you noticed that I've only been wearing his mask the whole time. And I'm not the successor of Dr. Mabuse either. Mabuse is still alive! I am Dr. Mabuse! - Dr. Mabuse! - I am alive! - Where is he? - On the train. He is... Oh my God... Quick, the incoming train! It's not my fault! Please believe me. Suddenly he was here and he pushed me... I know, I know. Others had to deal with him before. Call your supervisor! - Maria. - Father. Ok, we are ready. We are taking him to the West-Hospital. - Grab him. - Careful. - Joe. - Maria. Can I close the Mabuse case for the archives? - I wish I knew. - Why? Mabuse is dead. We thought that once before. We didn't find his body. Ok, it could've been burned. - But he could also... - Do you really think so? Than we have to do everything to find him. Have a look then. Go and find him if you can. "Among hundreds of thousands of people, if he should be alive this Dr. Mabuse. " Translation: neardark3 And monstroso 2011
