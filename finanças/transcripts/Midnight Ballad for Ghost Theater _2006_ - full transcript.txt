She's the only family I have! A, Araet, Araetnae?! Sir, uh, what's going on? Sir... I don't believe this... The time has come... Yes, we have waited long enough. I don't know what you're talking about. Do you believe in fate? Huh? I am amazed by the force of destiny that brought you to this old theater. Have you seen this per... MISSING Name Gang Shim-deok, Age 78 Two tickets for 3 o'clock movie, please. That'll be 9,000 won. This place is creepy. Especially the people who work here. Probably because it's old. It was built during the Japanese colonial rule. Will your grandma turn up if you wait at the box office? She said she was coming here to see a movie... I have nothing else to do anyway. And I'm behind with the rent. What about school? Well... I'm not gonna go to college anyway. Then what are you gonna do? What should I do? Watch fucking movies and become an actress. Then who's gonna sell the tickets? Who cares? This place is fucking deserted. MISSING Name Gang Shim-deok, Age 78 Who are you?! Shut up! Who, who are you? What, what are you doing there? The theater's closed for the day, leave quickly. The security guy will be mad! What? You're the one smoking in the theater! What, what are you saying? Are you Japanese? I am Ijawa Hiroshi, the lieutenant of the Imperial Japanese Army. Who are You? She's the new box office clerk. Because of your smoking, 23 strands of my hair fell out. Who... Who the hell are you? All hail, Princess Elisa! ♫ Listen to me, my beloved subjects, ♫ The bloody full-moon has risen to its height ♫ To knock on the cold hearts of the spirits ♫ What are you waiting for, ♫ now is the time ♫ Let us continue the atrocious performance tonight ♫ We are the traveling troupe of the night ♫ The offsprings of tragedy who are singing comedy ♫ Each one of us has a story to tell ♫ The show begins when we gather at this site ♫ Do not be alarmed at first sight ♫ The wondrous nightmare begins tonight ♫ Full of exaggerations and jumping to conclusions ♫ The dancing and singing traveling troupe of the night Isn't it awesome? ♫ They shudder at the mere imagination ♫ I am Elisa, the starlet of the traveling troupe ♫ They all pay homage to me and offer their submission ♫ Giving nightmares to those who dream ♫ Punishing them for their loneliness ♫ Oh Elisa, a diamond sparkling in the dark ♫ We are the spirits of darkness ♫ Spirits of huge meaninglessness ♫ We are the spirits of death ♫ The spirit of innocent Elisa ♫ We are the traveling troupe of the night ♫ Where time is running backwards ♫ The offsprings of tragedy who are singing comedy ♫ Putting on the never-ending performance Where do you come from, girl? She's the new box office clerk. Whatever. Will you obey my orders? I don't even know who you are. She's a stubborn one. What are you doing! Arrest her now! Now, we will start the trial. Wanda, begin. Begin what? The trial! Begin the trial. Mosquito, you do it. She who brings darkness to light, Who sparkles alone in the darkness Who lives a meaningless, dreamless, heartless life Princess Elisa, the goddess of wisdom The official charge brought against the defendant Seong So-dan is 'Smoking in public place.' However! The gravity of this case does not lie there. For years, she lived alone with her grandmother She had no dream to cultivate and no lofty mission to uphold Everything felt trivial and unfair. She was indifferent and intolerant. As a matter of fact, she was upset about this world. Unable to hide her fatal anxiety She begins to smoke in public place. She couldn't bear with The unbearably boring 21st century! Yes, she turned out to be a shameless modernist! Quiet, quiet, silence in court! Off with his head who dare to speak. Mosquito, I have no idea what you're talking about. You insult me with big words I don't understand! Mosquito, you shouldn't not be swearing in court! Since when has the defendant been smoking? From 10th grade. What made you start smoking? They said it would help me lose weight... And did it? It got rid of my constipation. Why on earth are you asking me these questions? Have you considered quitting? No! I had nothing better to do... I was looking for something to do consistently... The right to self-addiction! One of the few rights and certificates left to the modern people. The defendant has just made a decisive statement. Honorable Princess Elisa, I would like to call a witness against the defendant. Call the witness! The witness has not arrived yet. Call anyone! Hiroshi, you testify. Witness, take your oath. I swear to tell the truth. How do you know the defendant? I don't. I'm a veteran of the World War II and also an actor. Why are you still here and not back home? I was watching a Korean movie at the Ghost theater When a riot broke out. You were watching a movie when your country was nearly defeated? I'd promised my Korean girlfriend Ms. Mi-ja... Call Mi-ja! Stay calm, Princess Elisa. Mi-ja is not here. For the last time, What does the witness think of the defendant? She's not my type. That'll be all, Princess Elisa. This is nonsense. Now it's time for the verdict. The defendant Seong So-dan has dared to refuse my orders and with no evidence to prove her innocent, I find her guilty. Princess, punish her! Your charges are grave, but I will show you mercy. You may choose between three sentences. First, we will cut your throat and then pull out your guts. Second, we will pull out your guts and then cut your throat. What's the third? We pull out the neck and cut the guts. This is the most absurd trial ever! I will not play along your stupid game! Get your hands off me! Wait! Where are you running off to? What's it to you? You can't get away. I won't be taken in by you guys again. You have nowhere to go. I have a home. I'm far better off than you people Who live here without a home. If you love home so much, why did you come here instead? Idiot! Idiot! Stop crying! You think tears will bring you mercy? Let me tell you my story. ♫ I am the last princess of Joseon Dynasty of Korea ♫ Born under tragic stars ♫ Spent my days full of tears ♫ And let them slip away in scars ♫ One day, a poet of the streets came to me ♫ He had melancholy eyes and sentimental shoulders ♫ I fell in love with him at first sight ♫ I fell in love with him at first sight ♫ He looked woeful as the mirror ♫ Tell me cute guy ♫ What do you want from me? ♫ He was so cute ♫ What do you want from me? ♫ What do you want from me?

Give me 40 won, each. He, he folds! Then you have to pay me 80 won. Aren't you going home? Are you getting off work? Yes. Why? Nothing, I'll close up. Okay, then. Huh? Boss... You... You are... Boss, it's me, So-dan. Oh, that, that's right. Then why am I... No, why are you here? I know... I sometimes wake up in front of the store or on a rice field. I'm sorry if I scared you. Excuse me... You seem to be staying in the theater at nights these days. Yes... Are you... waiting for someone? Yes... No, there's no-one home. And the TV doesn't work... What will you do if a ghost appears? Aren't you afraid of the theater? No. And even if a ghost appears, It must have wanted to come out really bad. You are braver than you look. But sitting alone in a closed theater Is only for those with empty hearts. Not for the likes of young people like you. Have you found your grandmother yet? No... But I feel that she'll come back here the Ghost Theater Living or dead... You do know, right? That there are ghosts in the theater... What ghosts? The traveling troupe of the night. They perform here every night! Nonsense! You are old enough to tell the reality from a dream. You didn't get enough sleep, go home. I'll fire you if you keep on saying things like that. I'm sorry. And don't wander in the theater at night. I'm more scared of you than anything else. Hello? Hello? Would you like a ticket? You must be new. Yes, I've been here a few days. Are you here to see a movie? Yes. That'll be 4500 won. I am Mr. Park, a Korean film lover. Okay... What are you staring at? With that line from the forehead to the tip of your nose, You look like young Moon Hui and Do Geum-bong mixed together. What? Ah... nothing. I'm just going to watch 'One night on the knees' I'll pay you 2250 won. The princess is waiting for you. You bastard! Sit down, Hiroshi! Princess! Shut up and sit! I tell you once and for all If you talk during dinner, I'll cut your throat. So-dan, how is the food? To be honest... It's not that good. That's good. That makes it two of us. Thank you for inviting me though. I've never been invited by anyone before. It's not something you should be proud of. I was wondering where the 322 strands went... Oh, you count your hair? Oh, you don't? I've never done it. Hair is there to be counted! Otherwise, why would there be so many strands? But how do you count so many? You must practice. When I was your age, I practiced for two hours a day. But that doesn't seem interesting. You should try it first and then talk! There goes a fish. I've been waiting for you every night. You are not afraid of us? I would rather be afraid of something than be alone. Do we look easy-going? All right, why did you wait for us? There goes s a hat and an onion. You know my grandma, Gang Shim-deok, don't you? I saw you in the pictures. I know you guys were in the same traveling troupe. What happened? Hmm, you finally figured it out... Not bad... Yes, Shim-deok. She was a member of our troupe. There goes a girl. Where is she? Where did she go? Is she dead? Why are you asking me? You should know better than me. How should I know? She isn't in her right mind... She said she was going to see a movie she shot ages ago... - 'Bull-head'? - Mosquito! Do you know that movie? I don't want to talk about it. Why? I want to know. What's wrong with telling her? Hiroshi! Princess, what must be said must be said. That was our last film. So-dan, we were in the movie with your grandmother. Miss So-dan, we've never heard of such a movie. The reason why we haunt the theater without finding a resting place Is because of that movie. Us haunting the theater Has nothing to do with the movie. Mosquito! I want to see it anyway, My grandma's movie. I'd like to see it if the film still exists. If only I could watch the movie one more time I don't care if I die twice. I don't want to see it even if the film exists. I'd rather die twice than watch that damned movie. You son of a bitch! It must be somewhere in the theater. Wanda! Have you forgotten about that day? Forget? What kind of shit is that? ♫ After three years as a gisaeng ♫ The rich brat made me a woman ♫ One beautiful day he says ♫ Well, I mean... ♫ My wife found out ♫ You bastard, so what? ♫ I told you not to have that kid ♫ You fucking bastard ♫ You son of a bitch ♫ I kicked his balls ♫ and ran off with the traveling troupe ♫ Are you playing with me? ♫ Are you playing with me? ♫ You told me you loved me when you fucked me ♫ Are you playing with me? ♫ Don't give me that shit! ♫ After three years in the traveling troupe Going through ♫ All kinds of shit ♫ I finally shot my first movie ♫ I was going to be a star and get my revenge ♫ There are many movies in the world ♫ But none like mine ♫ Can you imagine how I felt ♫ When I died without seeing it ♫ Are you playing with the movie? ♫ Are you playing with the movie? ♫ You begged me to be in the movie ♫ Are you playing with the movie? ♫ Don't give me that shit! ♫ Don't give me that shit! ♫ That shit, that shit ♫ That shit, - ♫ Stop saying that shit - ♫ that shit ♫ What the hell are you talking about ♫ That shit, That shit - ♫ Shut your dirty mouth - ♫ that shit ♫ Stop it now ♫ Are you playing with me? ♫ You told me you loved me when you fucked me ♫ Turn your head and listen to me ♫ Don't give me that shit ♫ Are you playing with the movie? ♫ You begged me to be in the movie ♫ Raise your head and listen to me ♫ Don't give me that shit ♫ My head hurts, my back hurts ♫ Stop saying that shit ♫ Turn your head and listen to me ♫ Don't give me that shit ♫ Wake up, give back my movie ♫ Hey, you bastard, give back my movie ♫ Raise your head and listen to me ♫ Don't give me that shit ♫ That shit, that shit - ♫ That shit - ♫ Stop saying that shit - ♫ That shit - ♫ Stop it now ♫ That shit, that shit - ♫ Shut your dirty mouth - ♫ that shit ♫ Stop it now ♫ Stop saying that shit - ♫ Don't give me that shit - ♫ Stop it now ♫ Shut your dirty mouth ♫ Don't give me that shit ♫ That shit ♫ That shit ♫ That shit ♫ Don't give me that shit Is Mr. Woo Gi-nam here? And who are you? I am the real estate agent. Follow me. What's a real estate agent doing here? Well, I guess it's time to leave. What? Are you quitting? What else can we do when the theater closes? What do you mean, close? The theater might be sold off. - You're kidding me, right? - No I'm not. There are less than 10 people here a day. Even a corner shop would do better than this, goddammit. But... I still haven't found Grandma... MISSING Name Gang Shim-deok, Age 78 You look sad. They say the theater is up for sale... How do they know? In a small town like this, news travels fast. Well, it hasn't yet. And it's not going to. It's a shame old theaters are closing down one by one. What happened to all those glamorous old movies? Have you heard of a movie featuring a bull's head? No, never. A Japanese movie? No... There is one called 'Hornless Bull' made in 1927. I see... I must have heard it wrong. Who are you? This is embarrassing. Who are you? What are you doing in there? Ah, let me introduce myself. I'm Mr. Byhun, an exorcist. I was just passing by When I felt a really strong energy in this theater. Wait... You have a ghost about you. A ghost of an ancestor... Who's this? Who? You pathetic man. An exorcist scared of his own son's ghost. I told you to stay on my back! He has a weak spot for young girls... What happened, Mr. Byun? I was once the best byunsa, movie talker in the area Taught by the great Seo Sang-ho himself. Then those good-for-nothing talkies came along And all of a sudden I'm nobody, goddammit! Sorry to hear that, but what can you do? That's life. This is no time for idle talks. When will the theater be sold off? By the end of this month. We have less than a fortnight... We have to think of something. There is nothing to think about. We are doomed. We can't just sit by and let them kick us out. What can we do against humans? Let's just accept the fate and look for some other theater. It's because of ghosts like you that humans don't take us seriously, you idiot! Mind your own business, sucker! What? You want a piece of me? Come on! Shut up! Off with their heads now! I have a great idea! You guys are ghosts. "Don't you think that night is too short to talk about that useless story?" Ghosts are supposed to be scary, right? We'll scare the audience. They may be scared at first But when the word gets around town People will want to come to see for themselves Then the boss will want to keep the theater open.

Hello. I hear yesterday was awesome. My friends are dying to come here. They are going to shut the theater down sooner because of yesterday. There are no more movies to show... How terrible! Hey, about the movie you mentioned last time. Yes? Ah... one about a bull's head? I went to the public library and looked up all the literature on film history. Lee Young-il's 'Complete History of Korean Movies' came out in 1969 But apparently there were a few things He accidently left out. So he compiled those and published 'Complete History of Korean Movies- The Things I Left Out' the next year And the movie's mentioned in page 87... The official title is 'Minosu, the Bull-headed Human', 1945. Directed by Woo Gi-nam and starring him and Gang Shim-deok. Woo Gi-nam, Gang Shim-deok? It was reported to be the first monster movie in Korean movie history But the film was lost and nobody had seen it So it's unofficial. For some reason, the Japanese Government in Korea approved the production but banned it from showing after watching the rough film, The director secretly finished the movie and while showing it for the first time, Something really scandalous happened And the Japanese Government in Korea, afraid of the aftermath, muzzled the press. That's what it says. Something scandalous... I wonder what it could be. By the way, how did you come to know about this obscure movie? My grandma starred in the movie. What?! Isn't it beautiful? What? The lights... Yes... Just watch those lights and colors mixing together To create trees and rivers, humans and cities Feelings, ideas, histories. In there, there are unfeeling streets, heroic deaths Fun adventures, and fantastic love... Don't you find the drama of light incredibly sexy That builds on moments to create eternity Very sexy... When I sit here alone and watch a movie in this dark theater I feel like I'm some kind of a ghost. Have you ever felt that way? Everything feels like a dream and I don't exist at all. Even after the show is over and you leave the dark theater The life doesn't go on... And another movie is showing In another dark theater when you open the door. Well... do you mean the multiplex? You are up to something... Yes, I am... Who put you up to this? You think that will bring people back to the theater? But Boss... I thank you for trying to save the theater. But some things are just beyond our powers. We'll bring in the ghosts then. Not that ghost rubbish again! Stop it now! The theater is closing down anyway. It's late, go home. I want to see it, the movie you made. Dammit! The one you made and starred in with my grandma. You have it, right? I want to see it, please? You want to see my movie? Do you even know what it is? You are crazy, you are all crazy. Who would want to see a cursed movie that stimulates mythical imagination about desire and salvation? Either lunatics or idiots... Stop scratching yourself! Why make a movie and not show it to anyone, then? ♫ When darkness falls and the moon clouds over ♫ Theater is filled with boundless time ♫ The barbaric phantom that chokes your heart ♫ Empty theater, empty screen ♫ Fallen factory of dreams, the barbaric phantom ♫ It all feels like yesterday ♫ The Empire's war was nearing the end ♫ The hungry people of Joseon had to give up everything they had ♫ Girls and boys were dragged off ♫ Never to come back ♫ In unbearable fear and ineffaceable shame ♫ I made a movie ♫ A truly terrible movie ♫ That will fuck the terrible world ♫ But the bloody hatred gained a body ♫ And appeared before us in full form ♫ The theater turned into hell ♫ Leaving me to curse myself for the rest of my life ♫ The theater will go down under the curse ♫ And my destiny lies with it ♫ The remains of a dream with no more visitors ♫ The graveyard of lost souls ♫ Their screaming still fills my ears ♫ The remains of a dream with no visitors ♫ The graveyard of lost souls ♫ Their screaming still fills my ears Go home now. The show's over. Grandma... Grandma! Grandma... Grandma! Ahh, so this is the legendary movie. Let me see. It's burned in a few places but not too bad overall... Princess! If you show this, something terrible beyond your imagination may occur. Are you sure you want to do this? What could be more terrible than to have this theater shut down? Grandma wanted to see this... She'll come, for sure... All right, let's risk it then! But if it fails to scare the hell out of people I will cut your throat, for sure! The premier of Korea's first monster movie 'Minosu, the Bull-Headed Man' Exclusive! 'Minosu, the Bull-Headed Man'! The masterpiece by Woo Gi-Nam Which will blow away the incredibly boring 21st century! Today, the curse that will bring back the forgotten 60 years begins X breaks! Welcome, enjoy the show. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Testing, one two three 'The snow melts...' 'The snow melts into a trickle...' 'Oh please' 'No, no, don't do that' 'No, I'm just going to lie down' 'No, no, how can I trust you' 'Yes, Just trust me' 'Trust you with what?' 'You are so bad... hmm hmm' Are you ready? Well, I'm not so sure. It's been a long time... Mr. Jo? Let's roll! 'Minosu, the Bull-Headed Man' At some point in the 20th century food shortages were threatening the very existence of mankind. Rice industry, the main staple of the people of Joseon for hundreds of years. And the center of all economic activities was facing a critical situation due to falling birthrate of the cattle. A university research lab in Joseon was carrying out a top-secret project That could dramatically increase agricultural produce... A mad scientist Pyo Se-dong, who had studied in Tokyo, led the team and firmly believe that a new species 'Modern Agriculture' that could understand human language Yet had the strength of a bull was the key to modern agriculture. And after years of cross-breeding between cattle and humans, The experiment was at the threshold of success. Doctor Pyo was blinded by the sight of success While looking for a woman to bear the progeny He kidnapped gisaeng Wanwolin in broad daylight. After ten months of pregnancy, the birth was imminent. Now the humankind was to witness the human-headed bull, With the intelligence of a man and the strength of a bull The marvel of the 20th century new agricultural science. Ah, but what the hell?! Instead of a human-headed bull, a bull-headed human was born. Dr. Pyo's mighty dream to innovate modern agriculture By sacrificing an innocent girl to produce a human-headed bull Came to a crashing end, leaving the seed of tragedy. He himself was brutally murdered by his own creation. Ah... Modern agriculture... The bull-headed man, born with a tragic fate Was locked away in an underground maze He was named 'Minosu, ' since his coming into this world was about producing rice (mi) Fighting nature's wrath (no), and creating a monster (su) He spent his days in tears cursing his fate Who could ever fathom the sorrow of Minosu the bull-headed man? Meanwhile, there was a girl who brought Minosu daily food and water By the command of the Japanese Government in Korea And she was called Araetnae. Araetnae used to sit by and sew until Minosu finished his meal Oh shit! Isn't that Seong So-dan? Although he had never met a female in his life Minosu's heart slowly began to yearn for love. Happy first birthday! Listen to it when you're bored, and it will make loneliness go away. What the hell do you think you doing?! Boss! Stop it now! We have to save the theater. Do you have any idea what you're doing? Terrible things will happen if you show this movie! What is this terrible thing you talk about? There's an evil spirit hiding in the film. If it gets out, everyone here will die! I don't believe you! Even if I do, that evil spirit won't be half so terrible as you! What are you so afraid of? If you spend your whole life torturing yourself Will it bring the dead people back? You say, don't go near the ghosts? You are more ghostly than all of them put together! Stop thinking about how to die And get a life, just for once! With the World War II at its climax, The Japanese Government in Korea was under intense pressure And after deciding that a mere look at Minosu could scare the enemy Sent him to the battleground in the Philippines However, Minosu inflicted more damage to their own forces more than the enemy What a shame for the Japanese Army. At last, Minosu was deported back to Joseon And locked up in the underground maze once again as a circus freak show. But by the strange twist of fate, The girl working for the circus was none other than Araetnae, Araetnae herself. What story could be more dramatic? Meanwhile, the mean Princess Hashiba who came by the underground maze to gawk at the unique monster Was taken by his strong physique and demanded a night with him But with only Araetnae in his heart, Minosu refused the Princess' demand. The mortified Princess Hashiba summons her guard, Detzuo, to kill Minosu. Minosu regained his health thanks to the devoted nursing by Araetnae But was unable to find his way in the twisting maze Upon accidentally hearing about Hashiba's plans Araetnae suddenly had a bright idea. Minosu the bull-headed man Your cursed life comes to an end today. Prepare to die! Minosu, the bull-headed man! No! No! Bang! Bang! Bang! A failed life that nobody understood Comes to an end today. I will sleep long and cold In a place where there's no sorrow Ghosts disappear into darkness And anxiety into thin air. To whom does the shadow belong? None other than Araetnae herself! Yes, so it unravels and unravels and unravels And he winds and winds and winds. Ah what fun! Ah, what are we to do about the tender flesh showing Sweet Araetnae's belly, and her little navel Now, Minosu follows by winding the string Could their love last longer than the endless maze? Yes, hurry on and free our Minosu from the cave! Yes, they keep going, unraveling, following, following by winding Ah, soon happiness shall be mine! Oh no! What are they to do? Araetnae's sweater has unraveled too soon Even before they escaped the maze. What are they to do? Stop thinking about how to die And get a life, just for once! Meeting for preserving our culture.

Do you think, maybe, that I'm my grandma's, or Araetnae's ghost? After what happened last night, I thought maybe I was Grandma all along but didn't realize it. Nah, actually I'm sure I'm Grandma.
