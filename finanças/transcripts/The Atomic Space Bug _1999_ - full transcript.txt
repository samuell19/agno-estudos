Okay, so let me get this straight. You think that this meteor is originating from the same galaxy that the meteor that crashed landed in Santa Mira back in 1953 originated from? Yes, I do. Absolutely. And if this has the same cargo as the original meteorite. Then we are in way over our heads. What cargo might that be? Come with me for a second. No, no I am a scientist damn it. Believe me you don't give heartworm pills to a child they're for dogs. Goodbye. (Phone slamming down.) In 1953 a meteorite crashed landed in the small town of Santa Mira, California. 24 hours later 90% of that town's population had been mysteriously killed. They were mutilated. The military was called in to investigate these mysterious circumstances. What the military would encounter is unlike anything that they ever encountered before. What they encountered was, "The Atomic Space Bug." "The Atomic Space Bug" what's that? It's a ghastly looking creature. (whistling in back.) A creature with four Long Legs. It spits acid out of it's mouth. The military had finally defeated it, but defeating it was their biggest mistake. How is defeating it a big mistake? It turned out that the creature had a self-defense mechanism. Once the creature died it would self-destruct. How would it self-destruct? well it would explode, but it wasn't like your average explosion. It was a nuclear explosion. So everything within a 12 mile radius was devastated. Hence the name "Atomic Space Bug." Exactly. So do you think this new meteorite is carrying that type of creature? There's a very good chance that it is. Shouldn't we alert the authorities? Well, we should but technically, we're not allowed to. Not allowed to. Why? Because the government refuses to acknowledge the fact that there is any life form out in the galaxy besides us, they fear that if the general public found out about a creature like this, it would be Widespread Panic. So what do we do now? There's nothing we can do except cross our fingers and hope it's not a repeat of 1953.
