Kang Je-kyu Pictures The Legend of Ginkgo Tree Kim Seok-hoon Seol Kyung-koo Choi Jin-sil Kim Yoon-jin Lee Mi-sook Executive Producer Kang Je-kyu Written by Kim Seon-mi, Park Je-hyun Directed by Park Je-hyun Once upon a time... In the Mt. Holy lived Mae and Hwasan tribes. Mae made war on Hwasan to rule the world... ...and, worshiped by Hwasan, Mt. Holy punished Mae. Years later... Having been exiled to the barren land... ...Mae made the holy sword with blood and bones of 1,000 people... ...in an attempt to destroy Hwasan tribe and Mt. Holy. Now, the descendant of the Hwasan Royal Family... ...needs to be given as a sacrifice to complete the holy sword. No regrets? We'll be lonely. With you and our baby, I couldn't be happier. Why? Do you really think I loved you? Wake up! I only needed your sperm. You did your job! Forever, Mae tribe! The baby will die anyway. You want to kill it yourself? What are you waiting for? Go head! I'll never forgive you! Brothers and sisters of Mae! Having ruled the world for thousands of years... ...owning everything on earth... ...the curse of Mt. Holy put an end to our prosperity. In years to come, if there's to be our descendants, our own flesh... ...they'll rule the world again, and Mt. Holy won't stop them. With the holy sword made from blood and bones... ...let fight the curse of Mt. Holy! Descendants of Mae! Regain the honor we enjoyed and prosper forever! 500 years from now, when the black moon is up... ...a girl will be born and named Vee. Only her spirit can wake up the holy sword! Your holiness will shine the world... ...saving our tribe from the everlasting nightmare. Witness the eternity of Mae! With a 500-year-old promise, when the darkness falls... ...the spirit of Vee will complete the holy sword... ...that will free us from the chains of Mt. Holy! The spirit of Vee! Open the world of darkness! I'm taking her with me. She was born to be a sacrifice. You can't change her fate! It's also her fate that I'm to protect her! Don't be dirty her fate with the name of tribe Mae. I won't tolerate it! Bring her back to me. By all means! Years later... Where's Dahn? - Nowhere in sight! Where? - The valley of clouds! - Who are they? - Beats me. We shouldn't let them enter the village. A backward grip! He's from our tribe! Wait for Dahn. If we do, the village will be in danger. Come on! Are you okay? It's time to go home. Are you okay? It's all over. I had a dream last night. The golden leaves covered the whole village. I guess it tried to tell me you were coming. I gave it a lot of thoughts. It's not easy coming home after deserting your family. What happened today was Hwasan against Mae tribe. We couldn't care less about who's after you. Long ago, you deserted us and left Mt. Holy. Nether can you come back, nor stay here. Leave! Vee... is that your name? I heard Han call you that. Yes, Ma'am. - How old are you? - 15. It hasn't been easy for me. Right before you came, Mt. Holy cried. I guess we'll find out later what it meant. Han wants you to stay here. He believes that Mt. Holy will protect you. I won't ask you Whatever my dad wishes. You can stay, but Han is leaving tonight. This pendant of warrior symbolizes courage before death. It also symbolizes hope. Courage is the only hope that saves you from death. Someday, it'll clear your eyes out of fear. We've lived a life of hardships. But I know that daddy isn't a bad man. Don't worry about me. I won't. Though I won't be with you, I'll keep praying for you. Be well. It's from Vee. Take a good care of her. She needs friends. I haven't seen anybody making paper for ages. I would do it with my mom when she was alive. She said I was better at it than Juk. It's been already 5 years. I remember her. She was such a sweet lady. It's just an old memory now. You care so much about Juk. Because he's my best friend. What were you talking about? - Who? - You and Vee. I taught her how to make paper. You saw, didn't you? - Nothing else? - No, that was about it. -What are you getting at? -Nothing. You like her, don't you? Silly goose! I will be fine. I know I will! Come on! - Dahn! Dahn! Dahn! Come on! Today, sons of Mt. Holy became adults. Congratulations! You'll be off to Mt. Sunghwa in the morning. It's Mt. Holy that decides who survives... ...but those who make it back will be warriors of the tribe. We'll light the night for you. This is for you. I made it myself. It will protect you. I always take things from you. Haven't I told you? I'm your shadow. Thanks, man! I'm so lucky to know you. I'm happy that I can help you. It's the painting of prophecy. They say our future lies in it, but I don't buy it. Do you know that it's only Haeah and me who are allowed in here. In the morning, you'll be off to Mt. Sunghwa. When you come back, you'll be the patriarch. And, by the rules of the tribe, I'll be your wife. That's not... What are you doing? Have a safe trip. I don't want anybody else to become the patriarch. Let's get out of here. They're waiting for me. Who? Who's waiting for you? I've been looking all over for you. - Congratulations. - Thanks. You're leaving in the morning. - And? - Have a safe trip. - What am I supposed to say? - No presents? Oh, I completely forgot. Sorry about that. No, I've got one for you. There you go. Take it. My late father gave it to me. Play it when you feel down. It'll cheer you up. It worked for me. Goodnight. You look gorgeous tonight. Wait! Thanks. Tell me about it. About what? - I don't have your heart. - That's not true. It's Vee, isn't it? Does she know? What are you talking about? You've changed a lot since she came here. She's just a friend. Can you swear on it? Stop being silly. You're evading my question! I'm afraid you might give up on your goal because of her. Nothing's going to change. Vee needs friends. You can never be sure! All I want is to become a king and rule the world. I hope you mean it. Keep in mind what you want and who can help you. This pendant of warrior symbolizes courage before death. It also symbolizes hope. Courage is the only hope that saves you from death. Someday, it'll clear your eyes out of fear. Bye. Make it back! Our ancestors' fury was buried here 500 years ago. As the descendants, if we wreck vengeance... ...we won't be breathe as alive and close our eyes as dead. The day of fate is coming! We've got to destroy Mt. Holy and Hwasan tribe! Go bring back Vee, the key to the holy sword! Forever, Mae! The fire of Mt. Sunghwa will be waiting for you. By all means, bring it back to Mt. Holy. The tribe will be waiting for the new patriarch. Out of the woods is Mt. Sunghwa. Whoever stays alive, bring the fire back home. At any cost, we have to pull this off! - The leader... - I will! Dahn, take the lead. Help! Let's go! Pull! Are you okay? Pull! Dahn! The village! - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Go help others! It's okay. Warriors are back! Welcome home! Congratulations! Don't be sad. He's just being late. Maybe he's lost, or has a place to stop by. Wait for him. He's coming back. It's a mess in here. It'll take a while to clean it up. I thought I had to tell you what happened in person. We tried to save him but only to fail. It's all my fault. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. Don't say anything. Don't Dahn always supported you. He'd wanted to see you sit in the throne. I'm so happy you're back, but I just can't believe it. I can't believe he's gone. Feels like he's coming in here anytime soon. Yeah, he's coming back. Maybe he's already here. Dahn is not coming back! Dahn's dead. - Mom made them for you. - Thanks. They're pretty good. Try some. Delicious, isn't it? I know why you're sad. It's Dahn, isn't it? Is he dead? No... he's coming back. I'm sure he's coming back for you. He's here! Long time, no see. - Who is it? - Get back inside! Time to go home, girl. They're waiting for you. I'm not going anywhere. This is my home. No way! I wish I could tear you apart right now! But I won't You have a job to finish. It's shame that your daddy isn't here. You're late. It feels as if I was dreaming. A tree broke my fall, and I was in a strange place. - Somebody saved me. - Who could it be? Don't you leave me again. You hear me? I won't. I knew you'd make it back. The patriarch should be selected through the competition. But all the warriors and elders are in favor of Juk. Dahn? I'll accept their decision. Good. By the unanimous decision, Juk will be the patriarch. No! The position is only given to the best warrior. The tradition should be valued. Therefore, I ask for a duel with Dahn. I ask for your permission. The winner will marry Yun... ...and carry down the blood of the Hwasan Royal Family. For the honor of Hwasan, do your best. Why are you doing this? The best warrior should be the patriarch. Don't worry. You'll be the one. Let's call it quits before one of us gets hurt! What do you mean? You're willing to lose? - It's you that Yun wants. - And Vee wants you? Don't be mistaken. You can't deceive the tribe. If you don't do your best, you'll end up dead. Why are you doing this? I want Vee. How about that? What do you say? - What's wrong? - Mt. Holy... It's over. Pay respect to Juk, the new patriarch! Juk, where were you? - Congratulations! - Thanks. Sorry I've lost a friend, though. I'll see you later. She said she was going to Mt. Holy? By the precept of Mt. Holy... ...Juk, you'll marry Yun and become the new king. The wedding will be held 7 days from today. Dad would tell me about Mt. Holy. He said that I'd end up there, and it'd make me suffer. - I think the time has come. - I don't understand it. Forget about it. You're confusing me. The day you came back... What happened today ...it's not coincidental, is it? Didn't you see? Mt. Holy tried to kill me! Please, leave. I want to be alone. We broke the rule! People of Hwasan aren't allowed to go to Mt. Holy. Those who did in the past never made it back alive. We should be happy we're still alive. That's what frightens me. I came back alive, didn't I? - Why am I different? - I didn't mean it that way. Why? Why am I different? Go! I don't want you here. Sorry. The day you came here, Mt. Holy cried. I didn't know what it meant then, but I do now. The shaky ground, the evil spirit in the air... ...Mt. Holy was warning us of a disaster. Did you know? I think you couldn't tell us, but you did know. Mt. Holy is afraid of you cause you're to destroy it. That fate of yours is a disaster, damaging our tribe. Hold my hands. Mt. Holy will talk through you. As the black moon appears after the 3-day-long sun... ...two angry dragons will kill all the living things on earth. Trees will sooth the dragons... ...but the sword of the spirit won't be stoppable. When the sword shines... ...the world will quiet down with sadness... ...but the chains of sadness will last forever. Mt. Holy wants me. If I sacrifice myself to it, the tribe will be safe. I know now why my father wanted to go to Mt. Holy... ...and why he left me here. It was to protect the tribe. Haeah! I was born to be a sacrifice for the tribe. Can't you change my fate? Haeah! You can do it, can't you? Do I have to die? Can't you save my life? I will make more paper and stay outside the village! I won't break my words until the moment I die! Save me! Help me live! Haeah! Does Dahn know? Have you told him yet? Not yet. Vee wants to do it herself. Dahn won't buy it. He won't let her go. But there's nothing that Haeah can do. Mt. Holy has decided it, - and it was predicted long ago. - She knew? Haeah believes in the prophecy of the mural painting. Don't go! Give them time alone. Let me. - Anything wrong? - No, it's just the paper. Are you sure? The paper looks so heavy today. Cause everybody feels down. It will be okay when the fury of Mt. Holy subsides. I hope so. Juk and Yun will get married in a few days. Will you stay with me? I don't know. The life has never worked in favor of me. It made everything I wanted turn away from me. Because I wasn't with you. It'll be different from now. No matter what happens... ...I'll stay by your side and help you out. You can lean on me. Okay? Your ancestor painted it. I'm the new patriarch. Tell me everything about it. It's the holy sword you saw in the painting. Long ago, Hwasan and Mae went to a severe war. Having been exiled from Mt. Holy... ...Mae tribe tried to make the holy sword... ...with blood and bones of a 1,000 alive people. ...in order to kill Mt. Holy and exterminate our tribe. To do so, they needed the seed of Hwasan Royal Family. Soo, the chief of Mae, tempted the King of Hawsan, Han... ...and gave a birth to Vee who's to complete the sword. But it wasn't easy. Han brought her here... ...to protect our tribe and Mt. Holy.. If Vee is here to protect us, why sending her to Mt. Holy? When the black moon appears in a few days... ...it'll be the last chance for Mae to perfect the sword. They'll try to get hold of Vee and complete the holy sword. So Mt. Holy is using her as the sacrifice. It's the wisdom of Mt. Holy to protect our tribe. Can't we save her? Does Vee have to die for the tribe? We have to live up to Mt. Holy? What are you talking about? Leave. The time has come. - Out of the way! - Be reasonable. I won't let you stop me. It's for the tribe! How can you do this? As the patriarch, I have to protect the tribe. For the safety of the tribe, I'm willing to die. I bet you wouldn't do this if you were in my place. You made a big mistake, refusing the position. Why didn't you tell me? We could've run away. Sorry Don't go. Don't! I'm begging you. Don't go. Lock him up. I'll punish him later. Open it! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! What did you just say? We're not going to Mt. Holy. I'm taking Vee. I've made up my mind. Go back. I'll ask you who are the patriarch. If you let Vee live, our tribe will perish. Don't you know that? I don't care about the tribe. I'm no longer the patriarch. I changed my mind. Don't try to stop me. I won't let you! You've betrayed the tribe... ...and deserted your friends including me and Dahn. You'll be sorry. Change your mind, man. It's not too late. Come with us. Sorry. We're friends! Quit it! - Give it up. - I won't regret it. Go ahead! Why? - Don't do it! - Out of the way! It's the only and last thing that I can do for the tribe. I'm the only one who can do this! I'm coming And you're ruining it! If you care about me, don't do this. Nothing ever happened. Consider it as a dream. To Mt. Holy... Take me there. Will you? Come with me. Go! You've betrayed the tribe and killed your friends. Wasn't it for Vee? Get her out of here. Save her! You deserted me and that's painful enough. I can't hold them back long with only 6 arrows. Consider it as a farewell gift! Nothing to be done now. Mt. Holy will bring a disaster. Juk knows it very well... ...that the holy sword of Mae is the only thing to save Vee. He'll go to Mae for it. You've got only 3 days. If you fail to take Vee to the Mt. Holy... ...the sword will be perfected and used to harm Mt. Holy. If that's the case, it'll be the end of our tribe. The density of our tribe is in your hands. Find Vee and go to Mt. Holy. Any other ways to save Vee? The curse of Mt. Holy is already hitting her. She'll eventually bleed to death. The fate of the tribe should come before her life. Dahn! I know how painful that is. But you'll meet her again for the pain you're in. That's the nature's way. I put dews from Mt. Holy on it. Good luck. We've got only 2 days. I'm worried Mae might find Vee before us. What are you thinking about? Would I do the same if I were Juk? Then he would be after you. - You hate him? - I did. Not any more, though. I forgot about him. Sorry it didn't work out. Stop taking about him. Think only about the tribe. That's what counts. If not, you can go back. I'll let you go. I've chosen this way, and it was me who Juk go. And I failed to protect Vee. It's still warm. - Don't come closer! - Don't move! - Take me to Mt. Holy. - You'll die if you go. That's the fate that Mt. Holy has given me. It's my fate to protect you. You won't die! Don't be silly. Soon after I'll get the holy sword. Then, Mt. Holy can't kill you! I can save you! If you save my life with it, what about others? They're sacrificing you for their own lives! They are deserved to die! That's where Dahn is. If I live, he dies. The day you showed up, you occupied my mind. But I had to give up on you for Dahn. Why? He's my friend. Returning from Mt. Sunghwa, I thought I could have you. But, unfortunately, Dahn came back alive. I tried to forget about you, but I couldn't. The more I tried, to forget you, The more I wanted you. I won't do that any more. I will save you. And it will be me, not Dahn, by your side! Let me go. Let me go. Wait... Wait! Stop looking for Vee. Mae has nothing to do with her. You're desperate, aren't you? If you want to beg, do it right. I guess the hunting won't be as boring I'll let you live this time. If you get in the way again, you will be sorry. Let them live. We can use them as bait. Vee is nearby. We'll find her soon. When we first met, we became good friends. You were brave, warm-hearted, and loved the tribe. Let me remember you as the man I know. That's best for all of us. You can't satisfy everybody. It's dog-eat-dog out there. Nothing's more important than my love for you. Even if you save my life, I will never forgive you. Send her. No, not so fast. -You've got more to give me than Vee? - Why don't we become friends? - What do you want? - Vee! I don't care what you do with the holy sword. Cause Vee will resurrect after you get what you want. So? Promise me you'll let her go. Then, I'll help you. You know what my wish is? It's killing every single soul from the Hwasan tribe. And you're one of them. - What are you doing? - Aren't you going to run? - Not with your head. - Is that right? Here's your chance. My baby... You have grown up beyond recognition. You look just like your dad. Do you know who I am? No. You're not the person I missed, and I won't ask who you are. All I want to know is why you're doing this to me. You have no idea what curse Mt. Holy put on us. For hundreds years.. In the land of hell where no weeds grew... ...our ancestors had to eat their own flesh to survive. We worked very hard with our bare hands. They couldn't die with their bodies festering... ...and had to endure the pain of bugs eating them alive. It was all due to the curse Mt. Holy put on us! But, with the holy sword, we can destroy them. We're giving them back the pain they gave us. My baby... You can sooth the pain that our ancestors had. That's your fate. Consider it as an honor. Don't be scared. You'll sleep for a short time. Then, you'll be reborn as a daughter of Mae tribe. Go! It's no use. She can't get away! Hadn't you saved me then, Had I died then... ...this wouldn't be happening. I have to die. I'm too much burden on you. If there's anything left that I can do for you... ...I'll be by your side. - Can we meet again? - Sure. I promise. I'm sorry. I can't take you with us. Let's go back to the altar. He wants the holy sword. He will come to the altar to save Vee. We have to get back before him. Stopping the holy sword is the only way to expiate my sin. So I stuck around Vee and got to know you. It was you who saved me in Mt. Sunghwa. You protected Vee. The moonlight is dimmer. The black moon will be up soon. We've got to hurry. Wake up! Wake up! If the black moon is ours, it will bring Vee here. We'll see Can you hear it? It's calling the holy sword. The curse of Mt. Holy can no longer torture you. Hang in there. Just a little longer. The girl of a fate, the spirit of Vee... ...will bring the holy sword to us! The spirit of Vee! Destiny! Mt. Holy... You have to go there. Dahn is waiting for you. Be strong. You can do this. Where's Vee? Where is she? With the black moon up, the holy sword will appear. It will be useless, though, if you don't have Vee. You and your tribe will die. How sad! It's only the holy sword that can save her. I'm taking it with me. You think I'll let you have it? You'll have to. Either to save her or your tribe, one of us has to kill Mt. Holy. - And I have Vee. - Say it! Where is she? Right here. Inside me! Don't mess up with me. I'll tear you apart and find Vee! Go ahead. Thrust it in me! Why? Are you afraid? You want to see the holy sword? I'll tear your heart out. At last, you're back. Bring it! Bring it to me! Or you'll kill her? Can you do that? I don't think so. But I can cause that's my fate. Kill him! It's over. Should I kill you with this holy sword? Or should I let you have her? You listen to me. I'll let you have this sword. - On one condition! - Say it. You become one of us, Mae. Anyway, destroying the Mt. Holy... ...is one thing we have in common. I'll let you live to take revenge for our tribe... ...and you can have Vee. Can you do it? With the black moon gone, the holy spirits will kill me... ...but you'll be protected ...cause you'll be the last descendant of our tribe, Mae. As the descendants, if we wreck vengeance... ...we won't be breathe as alive and close our eyes as dead. Forever, Mae! You'll come back to me. Stop it! You think you can stop me? Let Vee rest in peace! That's our only help for her! How dare you say that, you two-faced prick! When you let her go... ...when you tried to get her for the tribe... Vee was with me! Everybody wanted her dead, but I protected her for my life! That's how we're different! Nonsense! Vee didn't want any of this! You cheated yourself and left yourself dream! No way. Dream isn't painful. It's over when you wake up. But there's something that you can't get yourself out. That's love! I can't let that love die. How can you love a ghost? - That's all I want! - I don't want to let her go, either, but that's her fate! Her fate my butt! I won't let her go! Kill me and let Vee go, or die to let her live! I'll be with her! No matter where she is, I'll be with her! That's how we're different. And you didn't love her. You were obsessed with her. It wasn't an obsession! Vee wanted you, but it was me who loved her! It was me! Stop right there. I'm begging you. Don't let me kill you. Please... There's something I always wanted to say to you. Sorry. I'm really sorry. I wanted to see you once for all. Goodbye. - Let me go with you. - No.I don't want you to. I promised you that I'd always be by you. Remember? You said you'd help me live a life that I choose. Please let me. Play it when you feel down. It'll cheer you up. It worked for me. When the black moon rises after a 3-day-long sun... ...a dragon with its soul lost will look for a hidden tree... The tree greeting the dragon, a golden snow will fall. And the soul trapped in the tree... ...will meet the dragon again with the blessings of God. Then, nothing on earth can separate them again.
