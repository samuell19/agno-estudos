[alarm chiming] [alarm beeping] -[alarm stops] -When I can't sleep, I'm literally a zombie. [soft growl] But when my doctor recommended Surreniquel for my insomnia, of course I had questions. Were the stories on the Internet true or just fake news? At Gemini-Hastings, we understand the confusion. That's why we are donating one dollars of every purchase to the Organization For Journalistic Integrity. Because Surreniquel is an effective and mild solution for troubles with sleeplessness, and is recognized by 17 of the world's most respected scientific journ-- [TV turns off] [sighs] [suspenseful music] [pops] [clinks] [sighs] [dings] [dinging] [pings] [tense music] [dinging] [inhales sharply] [explosions, gunshots] [clanks] [gasps] Toby?

[ominous music] [Toby's voice whispering] The Others are coming. [water running] [birds chirping] [insects chirping] [suspenseful music] [flies buzzing] [music intensifies] [lighter clicks] [The Whistleblower in electronically voice] In the Middle East, the US military outsources to private war contractors, Doubles the number of troops without telling the taxpayers. You can do things, hide things, no oversight. We're just one private company among dozens. We handle delicate operations. The Global War on Terror is a bottomless money machine that creates a fog around itself. So that no one here back home has the slightest idea of what's been going on in Afghanistan, the longest war now in US history, in Iraq, Syria, Libya... Spreading democracy and fighting terror endlessly without borders. Make sense, right? But there's one problem. Something very strange that doesn't make any sense at all. It's a vanishing act. All through the Middle East. Populations being erased. Weapons used in war have a habit of finding their way back home. This vanishing act, it's here now. It's come home to America. [suspenseful music] [bright music playing over speakers] [cash register beeping] [suspenseful music] [dings] [phone tapping] [dings] [sighs] [phone dings] [high-pitched buzz] [heartbeats] [music intensifies] [ominous stings] [cell phone ringing] [suspenseful music] Jay, I don't need a fucking job, man. -Alex. -Oh, Sam. -You're on your cell phone. -No, I was just making an important call-- You know, I tried paging you, but then I see you don't have your walkie. You know, the one I gave you last week. -I left it in the car. -[exclaims] I don't know what to do with you. Every time there's an excuse. Your shoes, you're not even wearing the shoes. Security guards don't wear running shoes, okay? -Every time there's an excuse, every time. -Okay, if I'm fired, then let's go, let's do it. [mellow music] [turn signal clicking] [The Whistleblower] The CIA contracted our company to oversee the distribution of a vaccine. A vaccine given out very low-key to tribes in villages off the main roads of Iraq and Afghanistan. Lucid-D is its name. A vaccine being tested on civilians. They were told it was for polio, but that was a lie. The Lucid-D vaccine wipes out populations. Seen it with my own eyes. Villages with hundreds of people empty, just months after being inoculated. But there's something even more fucked up. Call it a weird side effect. It's the bodies, they go missing. Eventually, you start asking questions. Like, where did you bury them? Where are all the mass graves? Then you get the strange answer. That there aren't any graves. That they didn't burn them either. That they're just gone. Lucid-D has come home to the United States. Our allies will soon have it too. But it wears a mask now. It's no longer a vaccine. It's a pill. [suspenseful music] [reporter on TV] The drug is called Rexittack, a Schedule 1 narcotic. And Jeremy was advised to immediately start injecting it or suffer grandiose side effects from a commonly prescribed medication called Surreniquel. You were scammed by a doctor without a license. He told me I would suffer brain damage if I continued taking Surreniquel. He said I would sleep better. On Rexittack? He said that? He, uh, gave me a schedule for three times-a-day, uh, injections. [reporter] But Surreniquel is a mild, commonly prescribed sleep aid, FDA approved and well-documented. -I've had three seizures-- -In six weeks? Six weeks. Uh, immune system's shot. I sleep maybe...

My transmission is fucked. And I've got her upstairs convincing the landlord that I smoke pot down here. Don't you? No, I go outside, but now I have a text saying that I can't do it anywhere on the property. Well, I got fired. -From the mall? -Mm-hmm. I guess that sucks. Carol Marson, estranged daughter of Betsy Marson Galloway. -So what do you want me to do? -Just follow her. Her mother thinks she's in a cult. -Really? -[chuckles] Yeah. Her mother's rich. She lives out of state. She's just been paying Derrett to keep tabs on her. -So where's Derrett now? -Derrett is in rehab. That's why you're helping me with some of this shit. Hmm. What kind of cult? All I know... [sighs] ...is she doesn't want anything to do with her mother or her mother's money. I guess that's a cult. Do you ever see Sarah? [girl speaking indistinctly in distance] Sarah? Like... Sarah's ghost? Yeah, maybe. Uh, no. Do you ever dream of her? No, man, I don't dream about my dead niece. Alex, what's the matter with you? Nah, I'm good. Jesus Christ, you're obviously still taking that sleeping pill that fucks with your dreams. -Hashtag fake news, dude. -[chuckles] Yeah. -It doesn't mess with my dreams. -Hmm. [woman clears throat] [camera shutter clicks] Oh, Jesus Christ! [exhales] She's fucking nuts. Dude, did she just take a picture of you smoking that joint? Did I tell you she thinks the Earth is flat? Dude, why don't you just smoke it at the park? Why doesn't she just get a fuck buddy or something? People do crazy shit like this when they've got nothing to live for. -Kinda like me. -Shut up, Jay, you got tons to live for. Oh, good. [suspenseful music] Maybe you can make me a list sometime. [music intensifies] The Lucid-D molecule is now in a drug called hyborexitan. A pharmaceutical company in the US called Gemini-Hastings Biotech had it patented last year. It's the main ingredient in their flagship drug, an insomnia medication called Surreniquel. It took just six months for the company to get the drug ready for FDA approval. six months to develop it, do all the studies, run all the human trials. Six months is impossible. The three scientists that invented Surreniquel are the brains behind Lucid-D. I know this because they worked for the same war contractor from 2003 to 2015. I knew them. Surreniquel wasn't conjured up in a lab in six months. It was developed in Afghanistan and Iraq, tested during the war. I'm telling you, it has wiped out small populations in war zones all over the Middle East. But Lucid-D didn't happen without help from high places. Surreniquel is the result of a well-planned effort.

Are you just gonna leave me stranded here? Did you drive my car? [scoffs] What the fuck? You're a lousy detective. Someone should revoke this. Thank you very much. No password on your own phone? I actually did you a favor back there. Yeah. And how's that? If the cops saw you seizing... ...they would have taken you. Taken me where? Where no one would find you. How long was I out? Not long. I'm assuming my mother hired you. "You let me die at Alger Park"? You saw her. Can anybody else see her? I doubt anyone noticed. She's not looking for attention. Are you a psychic or some shit? Do I see dead people? She's not dead. Then what is she? Was she your girlfriend? And she died here at Alger Park? When? You know way more about me than I know about you. Last year. And that angel on your phone? She gave that to you in a dream, right? Bet you have a hard time getting rid of it... ...even though it freaks you out that you got it in a dream. [sighs] Should I stop taking the Surreniquel? Like your flyers say? You're way past the side effects. -Should I go to a doctor? -I wouldn't. They have to report it now. -Report what? -People like you. [car approaching] [scoffs] This would be my cult. Assume you have my number. You may wanna give me a call if you want my help. Wait. What kind of help? That woman with the mask? She's not your girlfriend. Don't believe anything she says. [van door opens] [van door closes] [somber mellow music] [music intensifies] [Benjamin] We live at a critical time, when extreme weather and sea levels are on the rise, when oil companies are building drilling platforms on increasingly more dangerous waters as our primary source of power, a finite resource, has started to run out, when more than one third of our world's species will be erased by mid-century because of us. And the human population continues to grow. And when Trump won the election in 2016, half the nation thought the world was gonna end. But unfortunately, Trump is just a symptom. You see, America is the richest nation in the world. But 40 million of our own people live in poverty. We're an empire on the verge of collapse. We spend more on our military than the next eight... ...eight countries combined. We've been living in an Orwellian reality since 9/11. You know, Afghanistan is now the longest war in US history. No end in sight. Ed Snowden revealed that we're being watched by a massive surveillance system, but we hardly care. You know, my brother was a patriot. He was sent to Afghanistan to find Bin Laden, then to Iraq after Bush and Blair's bait and switch. Uh, The War On Terror is the greatest con job of the 21st century. And Jeff, like so many soldiers, has paid a very high price. In 2000, a Washington think tank called The Project For A New American Century, with neocons like Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, called for America to push its military into the Middle East to create a new enemy after the fall of the Soviet Union. In 2007, this was confirmed by four-star general Wesley Clark, who revealed that a document had been circulating the Pentagon in 2001 that called for an invasion of seven Muslim-majority countries within five years. You know, fast forward 2016... ...under the leadership of Nobel Peace Prize winner Barack Obama, the US drops 25,000 bombs at seven Muslim-majority countries. [explosions] The average Westerner is basically illiterate when it comes to the Middle East. Yeah, we know words, you know, "Al Qaeda," "Syria," "Assad"... ...but none of us really care or know what's going on. I think that's by design. In Orwell's 1984, war is perpetual, the enemy is ambiguous, and the battlefield exists in a faraway place without meaning. The masses simply fear the enemy and root for the home team. We've been put to sleep by a mass hypnosis so powerful it erases our collective memory every time we discover we've been lied to. [sighs] And the weird part... ...is that the real truth... ...it's much scarier than all the lies. [woman] I've got no appetite. I'm sore everywhere, and I'm just really tired. Rexittack, it's ruined me. Look at me. This drug was given to me by the scum of the Earth, a liar, wasn't a, a licensed doctor. I was fine on Surreniquel. I, I was sleeping just fine. Just look at me. [Benjamin] Rexittack is a hoax. On our breaking news here, uh, poster child for this entire Rexittack, uh, epidemic -Jeremy Dorsett. -[swoosh, pop] He has deactivated his Twitter account two hours ago. Reason being? Suddenly some photos emerged showing a professional makeup artist supplying fake Rexittack skin damage onto our beloved Jeremy before his now fake MSNBC and Fox interviews. Netflix has already canceled his big premiere on Friday night, REXITTACK NATION, blowing his chances for another White-Helmets-style Oscar win, obviously. This Rexittack epidemic is a hoax. Corporately-controlled... [laughs] Corporately-controlled mainstream media, they wave their magic wands... [suspenseful music] [sighs deeply] [somber music] [suspenseful music] [exhales] [eerie music] [mumbling] [gasps] [gasps] [eerie sting] [dog barking distantly] [sighs in relief] [tense music] [heartbeats] [woman whispering] Alex. [high-pitched buzz] I'm not dreaming. [cell phone ringing] [music intensifies] [clanking] [footsteps approaching] [woman whispering indistinctly] [man speaking indistinctly] [distant rattling] [stun gun electric shocks] [suspenseful music] [metal jangles] -[Carol] You're drugged. Give it up. -[Alex sighs] [breathing heavily] [Carol] It wears off. You have no idea. This is so much bigger than you. The nightmares? I had them. You better trust me. [soft dramatic music] [Benjamin] My brother joined the service because he wanted to catch the terrorists behind the 9/11 attacks. So when the US lied to the UN Security Council in order to shift the focus from bin Laden to Iraq, my brother didn't question the bizarre schizophrenia of the whole thing. And when Jeff was, uh, shipped off to Iraq, we weren't speaking. He said that I was unpatriotic for asking questions. Months later, something changed. Uh, Jeff started sending me letters. Guys in Jeff's unit were hearing stories about villages that had been wiped out, not by combat. Weird ghost towns, people missing for no reason. So one night, Jeff and a couple of the guys ventured out to see for themselves. And they found an empty village. Uh, TVs and radios left on, dinner on the table, livestock still kicking. No people. Uh, they found a little girl hiding in the walls of an empty house. She said that monsters came at night and kidnapped people in their dreams. Jeff and, uh, two soldiers, they got caught, they got court-martialed and sent home. Jeff had bad PTSD. He was thrown in a veteran's hospital and put on a drug cocktail. That included Surreniquel, supposedly still in drug trials. And the other two guys... ...in different hospitals in different states, also on Surreniquel. All having nightmares about the war. Jeff, uh... Jeff started having nightmares about his best friend Ralph, he, he got his head blown off by an IED. Soon, Jeff was hearing a strange noise in his head and claiming that Ralph was wandering the halls of the hospital. Jeff freaked out on a nurse when she denied having seen Ralph's ghost, denied screaming after seeing Ralph's, uh, blown away face. My dad, uh, tried to get him out on a weekend pass, but they threw Jeff in a straitjacket and locked him up, and that's the last time we saw him. You know, the official story was that all three men were released on their own recognizance. My parents, uh, got caught up in a lawsuit with the other parents accusing the government of having men kidnapped, as an extraordinary rendition. Went nowhere. But what actually happened, the unofficial story, is that Jeff and the two soldiers, they vanished. And they were taken, but... ...not by the government. They were taken by The Others. [distant train chugging] [train chugging] [insects chirping] [soft suspenseful music] [handcuffs jangle] I'm sorry for all of this. I'm Dr. Ferguson. Carol used to work for me. You mean before they took away your license? They said you were disoriented when they found you. Found me? They broke into my apartment. [scoffs] [music swells] You got this from a dream? From an ex-girlfriend... ...who died. Alex, by any chance, did your girlfriend take her own life? And you felt a strange need to keep this, even though it's got a chipped wing? She made it. When were you put on the drug? [inhales, exhales] Last year. For insomnia? And anxiety. I'm sorry to inform you that the Surreniquel damaged your brain by the sixth week of you taking it. [scoffs] But from what Carol has told me... ...you've gone way beyond the regular side effects to a place that only a very few seem to go. All right. And why should I believe you? I worked for the company that makes it. I know what it does. At first, you started to sleep better. You had more energy during the day. And then the dreams started. [music continues] You've never seen a war, have you, Alex? But you dreamt of war. And human suffering. Then along comes Sarah. She said she was trapped. And that you were the only person who could help her escape. But she's just a dream. [sighs] Carol said she was wearing a mask. Yeah, she made them and sold them online. Did Carol ever tell you about Toby? No, I didn't. Toby was a little boy from Carol's childhood who disappeared. When she started the drug, Toby eventually found his way into her dreams. But the Toby in Carol's Surreniquel dreams... ...was different from the little boy she knew. He was made of stone, face and body. And he had an excellent reason for this. Why? Probably the same reason Sarah gave for wearing a mask. Because I couldn't remember her exact features. So a mask makes sense, sort of. But what's a mask if it can't hide the truth? [sighs] They make a good point, actually. Our memories aren't as accurate as we think they are. We tend to think of the brain as having a hard drive, like a computer, and that our memories are stored somewhere inside in perfect condition. But science has yet to find even a thumb drive up here. I don't think memories are stored in the brain at all. Well, where would they be stored then? I think brains are more like TVs than computers. You can watch The Brady Bunch on TV. But if you open up the box, you won't find Jan or Alice. You won't find a little Mike Brady in the wires and the LEDs giving lectures that don't even cut it in the real world. You won't find any of it. Why? Because there's nothing there. The show is just a transmission sent to a box. Transmissions over channels. Not storage. That drug... ...has added a brand new channel to your brain. You've started to hear a strange noise. Yeah. We call that The Signal, Alex. We think it's a transmission your brain is receiving that you are not meant to hear. -It fucks up my vision. -Yes. I see Sarah when I'm awake. She saw her too. When you hear The Signal, Alex, everyone can see her. Where does it come from? We don't know. What we do know is that people like you who start hearing it don't last very long. We can temporarily block The Signal and buy you some time. How? You've already been injected with a small dose of Rexittack. What? Why the fuck would you do that? -We're not talking the street version, Alex. -What the f-- -What the fuck's wrong with you? -Alex, they're lying to you about Rexittack in the news. -It's not even the same drug. -A bunch of fucking crazy cult people. I'd like to go now. Is that possible? [handcuffs jangle] Fine. But you should know that that small dose of Rexittack is not enough. -[scoffs] -[Ferguson] It won't last. [laughs] There's a new treatment I'd like to try. [inhales] Shut up. I'm not listening-- Alex, it works. It worked for me. Hey, what if I don't do it? Everything you're talking about? Then you'll disappear. Is that a threat? [Ferguson] He's not a prisoner. Don't treat him like one. [engine whirring] [engine revving] Dude, what the fuck? [dogs barking in distance] [crickets chirping] [can clanks] [dial tone] [man] 9-1-1. What's your emergency, please? Sorry, I meant to... ...call the station. [sighs] [birds chirping] [sighs] [soft suspenseful music] So during his last months, uh, my brother became obsessed with the history of mass disappearances. You know, bizarre cases where large populations mysteriously vanished for no reason. Like the disappearance of the settler colony of Roanoke, near North Carolina. The Brazilian village called Hoer Verde where 600 people vanished in 1923. You know, Jeff was especially obsessed with a weird case from the UK in 1906. A Jim-Jones-style cult lead by a charismatic fellow writer named Alistair Skinner, called The Church of The Others. Had about 200 followers, initially based in London. When family members started sniffing around, Skinner moved his flock to a plot of land in rural Wales. The police raided the camp but only found two cult members, an old woman and a teenage girl. And the rest were gone. They told the police a bizarre story about beings from another dimension called The Others. They said The Others feed on fear like a drug, and use nightmares as portals between their dimension and ours. See, at bedtime, uh, they were forced to ingest this white powder which Skinner said made their brains more receptive to The Others. So, through The Others, he said there were three stages to salvation. First, you suffer nightmares. Violent dreams about people hurting other people. The second involves being haunted by dead loved ones. The third stage, they call communion, when your body and soul merge with The Others and you transcend our world. Neither could explain why they were the only two left behind. Only one paper mentioned that the girl complained of a strange noise in her head. So the police dug up a large burial plot, hoping to find the bodies of the missing cult members. Instead, they felt a coffin with no body. Just a diary and a photo. The only photo you can find of Skinner. He's surrounded by three figures called The Sisters Of Sorrow, gatekeepers of The Others' dimension. So, supposedly, Skinner was buried in the coffin, in a sleep, as part of a ritual that would give him access to multiple dimensions. A reward for his faithful service. Weird story. And hard to swallow when your brother's losing his mind. Of course that all changed when the Surreniquel controversy got out. When a drug company with serious ties to the military fires 95% of their doctors worldwide, something's up. You see, these are scientists who are risking their careers to warn the public about the drug they themselves worked on. [music continues] I think The Others are real. If believing in multiple dimensions is crazy, then so is science, and so is mathematics. They've been watching us, salivating at our centuries of stabbing each other in the back. See, The Others are a parasite. They're the, uh, multinational extracting oil from a defenseless ecosystem, and then moving on. They're just in it for the high. The real nightmares are the Alistair Skinners and Hitlers who let them in, the kind of evil that never dies, the kind of evil that's just... ...too big, uh, too big for one man. [man on TV] All law enforcement agencies and the military have been organized to search out and destroy the marauding ghouls. Their survival as the heavy rain-- [suspenseful music on TV] [movie playing on TV in background] [rocking chair creaking] Holy fuck! [chuckles softly] This is... Holy fuck! Don't look so freaked out, man. Don't worry, she won't tell her mom. I guess she fucking won't. Look what she's involved in. So what about Derrett? Fuck! He's in rehab. That fucking drug is messed up. [scoffs] And the media's feeding us a bunch of bullshit. I think that's a bunch of bullshit. Holy Christ, they're fucking liars, man. [sighs] If you think Wolf Blitzer and Rachel Maddow are serious journalists... [chuckles] ...you are a disgrace to millennials. Whatever that means, dude. When I was a kid, we had 13 channels, and something called investigative journalism. -You didn't have 13 channels. -We had a rotor. I'll tell you about it sometime. [woman crying on TV] But these CNN guys, they're all multimillionaires. -PR firms... -So what? ...stylists... I don't wanna get into your shit right now. Look, I think they're really fucking with my head. Injecting me with Rexittack. [woman whimpering on TV] Got my eviction notice today. Really? Yeah. The flat-earther. She's got the landlord convinced I smoke down here. A bunch of other bullshit I didn't even know about. Well, I think your landlord's stupid for believing her. Alex. [exhales] You've been telling me that for months you've been having these messed-up nightmares with... ...some fucking fem bot pretending she's my dead niece. Are you telling me it was just guilt? No. -Was it the drug? -Look, I shouldn't have said anything. [woman on TV] No! No! [Alex] What's this? [woman on TV] No! Night of the Living Dead. [woman on TV] No! No! It looks like The Walking Dead, just black and white. No! [screams] No! It's so ahead of its time. It's the 99%, rising from the dead. Because these people inside are just too stupid to see how fucked up the system is. So what? They're gonna break in and tell 'em? No, they know that's pointless. They just eat them instead. [chuckles] [suspenseful music continues playing on TV] What I said before, I'm sorry, man. My sister... ...was a shitty mother. I, I hate to say it but... ...Sarah took a backseat to my sister's endless parade of psychotic boyfriends. I know. [sighs] If I wasn't such a loser... -...I'd have adopted her out of that goddamn mess-- -Jay, you're not a loser. Point is... ...when you two started seeing each other... ...Sarah had a little spark in her eyes. Clearly, it wasn't enough. No, well... ...her road was mapped out long before you guys even met. [sighs deeply] Jay... ...I don't think I know who I am anymore. [Jay sighs] [grunts] Neither did she. [exhales] [heartbeats] [tense music] [heartbeats continue] [music intensifies] [music stops] This is real. [ominous music] [Benjamin] In the next few decades, sea levels will continue to rise. Extreme weather events will continue to grow, both in strength and number, and many of the poorest regions of the Earth will become virtually uninhabitable. If you don't believe the science, you might consider the warnings of the World Bank, or the US military itself. Climate change and a growing population with nowhere to go. Mankind has never faced the terrible things that are coming this century. Governments will collapse and armies will be outnumbered when an immense global migration crisis on a scale unimaginable destroys everything we've built. Except for one constant. A hard truth about our history is that democracy as we know it, it's only a few hundred years old. We've always been ruled by an elite upper class, a small group of immensely powerful families and individuals who control governments, corporations, land, resources, and anything else you can think of. In the last few decades, they've been consolidating their power through trade deals and banking laws. The richest 1% today owns half of the world's wealth. Alistair Skinner was a self-serving religious maniac, and pieces of his diary are all over the Internet. They predict a doomsday scenario, like most of the world's religions. I'm an atheist myself, but if I had to place a bet on Armageddon, I'd put all my money on this century. The Others? They know what's coming. The vaccine and the Surreniquel? Just an opening act. See, The Others have struck a deal with a class of human beings who will do anything to protect their power. An out-of-control, terrified population teeming with nightmares won't be a problem for the 1% when the masses suddenly begin to disappear. [heartbeats] [high-pitched buzz] [high-pitched buzz intensifies] [high-pitched buzz fades away] [suspenseful music] [dogs barking distantly] [tense music] [Carol] Toby was my best friend. I was nine, he was six. My mother didn't like it. She was just embarrassed that I was best friends with the son of a poor woman she hired to be her housekeeper. [birds chirping] There was a forest at the edge of town. It was a Sunday. I wanted us to ride our bikes to the woods, me and Toby. We had this urban legend in our town. A gang called the Black Daggers that had a fort in the woods, where they had animal sacrifices, and satanic rituals. I told my dad that we were biking to the school... ...but we rode to the forest. It was huge. We rode our bikes for, like, an hour. And got lost. When we couldn't find the path that we came in on, Toby started crying. I got mad and hid by a creek. When Toby finally stopped yelling... ...I went back to find him.... [insects chirping] ...but all I found was his bike. It got dark, my dad showed up. There were search parties. It was all over the news. We never found him. And you're not even listening. No wonder you had nightmares. That thing in my nightmares, it wasn't Toby. It was impersonating my memories of a stone statue. This ugly memorial... ...built by my mother's church. The same freakish grin. One night I smashed it with a hammer... [tense music] ...but that just made it scarier. [eerie music] I was the first person to try the treatment a year ago. No more stone boy. And the Surreniquel nightmare stopped. [suspenseful music] And so did The Signal. [dramatic music] Climate chaos is not such a big deal when you can build your own fortress on high ground. But an out-of-control world population is a threat to the One Percent. Even a fortress isn't safe when millions of savages are charging your gates. So, The Others will wipe out most of the population for the oligarchs. In exchange, The Others will get prime-time access to our suffering... ...and our nightmares. It's the perfect deal. No one will believe it. The thing about conspiracy theories is that eventually, the internal documents get out. When Gemini-Hastings fired its doctors, uh, for blowing the whistle on Surreniquel, many of them joined an underground resistance of hackers and extreme activists. They are desperately working together to uncover evidence about the drug about The Others, the New World Order. Rexittack is just one attempt at finding an antidote. They call these dream tokens. These are objects that have come from inside the Surreniquel nightmares. Now the FBI pulls these photos as fast as they leak online. All kinds of new metals, stuff not on the periodic table. Maybe these will lead to something. [muffled chatter] [Carol] ...keep changing. [muffled chatter] Yeah. Hey. Hey. [clears throat] [background chatter] What is it? Maybe it's like the angel. She gave it to you in the dream. -No, it wasn't her. -Who was it? I don't know, I don't remember, but it wasn't her. Are we conducting a séance? Alex, the treatment we're about to try tonight might not work. But it worked for her, right? How many people have you tried this on? Another two milligrams of Ativan. He's too lucid. [zipper closes] Alex, here's the deal. Whatever happens tonight, I was never here. -You and I have never met. -[chuckles sarcastically] We're applying what little we know to a problem we barely understand. But what if it doesn't work? Then I have nothing else to offer you. [bodyguard] Dr. Ferguson... ...I'll be outside. Okay. [soft tense music] Something will happen to her, right? [Ferguson] Tonight, Alex, her name is Sarah. But she's an imposter. Don't forget that. And she's lying to you to breach a barrier. What barrier? A line not meant to be crossed. Will I remember anything? [suspenseful music] Hopefully not. [Mike] How are you feeling? Like Jell-O. Okay, what am I supposed to be seeing here? Absolutely nothing. Good, then they're working. You're all set. Okay, now I'm seeing red. Let's get started. Alex, take a deep breath. [inhales] [in headphones] Let the light absorb you, and the sound wash over you. [clock ticking in headphones] Let go of all your thoughts and let your mind wander to a vast expanse. Moment by moment, you float deep and deep to a place without space... ...and a time with no worries of any kind. [white noise and clock ticking in headphones] Where your mind is free to wander.... ...in a dream that lasts forever. [white noise and clock ticking in headphones] [suspenseful music continues] [music swells] [Ferguson] Alex, what do you see? A hose... ...exhaust flooding the car... Sarah? -Where's Sarah, Alex? -She's in the car. [suspenseful music] [high-pitched buzz] [Fergunson] Alex, what is Sarah doing? She's wearing the mask. [unsettling music] [Toby's voice] Carol. [gasps] [glitches] [gasps] Alex, you need to grab the mask. I can't move. [snarling] You need to try. -Remove the mask, Alex. -I can't move. [devilish laughter] Grab the mask. Grab it. [tense music] [demon faking sobbing] [baby whining] Okay. [tense sting] [grunting] [sizzling] She's doing it. [Ferguson] Doing what, Alex? Giving me the mask. [sizzling] And now... ...I'm wearing it. [heartbeats] [tense music continues] [high-pitched buzz] [music intensifies] [man] FBI, open up! [distant, slow explosion] [high-pitched buzz] [squawking] [high-pitched, steady buzz] [Alex] There's been a terrorist attack. The whole country. We are in a state of emergency. They hit our water supplies. -Where is everybody? -Everyone's driving to medical checkpoints. -Alex, where is Dr. Ferguson? -I don't know. It's a nerve agent. A really bad one. Carol, they're saying there's a vaccine. -We all need to get vaccinated-- -This doesn't make any sense. [Alex] Tell me about it. Six states, 48 cities and counting. Alex, what happened after Dr. Ferguson brought you out? She didn't. And they already know who did it. Russia and Iran. And North Korea likely hacked the water utilities computers. Do you remember being put under? Of course. What's wrong with you? Carol, this is serious. -What do you remember? -Who cares? Read this list. Look at this shit. -"Extreme diarrhea... -Alex? -...seizures, burning skin, sudden rage--" -Alex! Alex! -Look at me. -[in distorted voice] What? [tense music] I remember everything. The red light, Ferguson, you and that Mike guy. -What's wrong? -Nothing. Yeah. Well, I woke up not too long ago. You were still asleep on the couch. I guess I assumed they already left. They wouldn't do that. [music intensifies] We need to leave. Why? Aren't you listening? [in normal voice] To get to a medical checkpoint. [steady pitch buzzing] The Signal. I heard it. [melancholic music] I saw Toby. [dial tone] -What are you doing? -I'm calling somebody. -Who? -I don't know, whoever answers. Hang up the phone. -Carol, hang up the phone. -[mouthing] Hang up. [suspenseful music] Neither one of us knows what happened to them. You're right. Because we were both asleep. [high-pitched buzz squawking] Come here. Read this. [music intensifies] [melting rubber] -We'd better do it. -Do what? Essential supplies, we're gonna need them. [sighs in relief] [Alex] What are you doing? There's a first aid kit under the sink in the bathroom. And there's blankets in the living closet. Alex, where exactly are these medical checkpoints? Do you know how to get there? [in distorted voice] Yes. [tense music] [stun gun electric shocks] [Alex exclaims] [Carol panting] -[groans] -[grunts] [Carol panting] [suspenseful music] [woman on TV] We are sending this transmission from the future. The future population has been wiped out by an alliance between The Ruling Elite and a terrorist organization of other-dimensional origin called The Others. All that remains of the world's citizenry is a small, slave population. This transmission is jamming their signal. Your brain has a unique structural anomaly caused by the hyborexitan toxin, allowing you to receive our message. Listen carefully. We now know that there is no scientific difference between dreams and reality. They are simply alternate dimensions bridged by a state of consciousness called the Lucid Divide. Others like you are mounting a resistance by crossing dreams and time. Our only goal is to stop the Great Global Disappearance before it happens. Anyone who is with you now is likely an agent of The Others or of The New World Government itself. The Lucid Divide is a dangerous state where realities intersect and nothing can be trusted. We are trying to extract you. Leave behind all digital devices. The enemy is using them to track you. [glitching] [high-pitched buzz squawking] [tense music] [Carol] I had a dream. That I'm driving on Horatio Alger Road... ...this endless road that leads to a wonderful life. But the road is full of potholes... ...and buried in the thick fog of factory smoke. In the dream, the driver is not me. And the voice on the radio... ...it's my own voice. And I'm talking to myself. "Carol, open the door. Open it now and fall out on the road. Too late, he sees you." At the end of the dream, I realize that the driver is a nightmare. [Alex in distorted voice] This is not a dream. Are you gonna kill me? I just deliver you. [high-pitched buzz playing] [ominous music in a crescendo] [gasps] [keys jangle] [grunts softly] [key turning] [exhales sharply] Come on. [sighs] [insects chirping] [gasps] [suspenseful music] [melancholic music] [ominous music] [Toby's voice] Carol! [tense stings] Carol! [ticking sounds] [whispering] Carol. [music intensifies] [in distorted voice] You're special, Carol. They want you to join them. [gasps] [panting] [suspenseful music] [fly buzzing] [glitching] [music intensifies] [rifle firing sounds] [Islamic chant humming] [bomb exploding] [fly buzzing] [in distorted voice] They need to know if you share their values. [exhales] [dramatic music] [in distorted voice] This is not a dream. And you are not asleep. [dramatic suspenseful music] [screaming in deep voice] [dramatic music] [high-pitched buzz intensifies and fades away] ...sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. [dramatic music continues] [music fades out]
