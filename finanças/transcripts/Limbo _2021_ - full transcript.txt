Her condition is stable. But she's suffering from shock. MRI shows nothing unusual. But she's not responsive. She's probably suffering from PTSD. Wong To. Wong To. It's okay. Thank you. Fine. Wong To. Cham wanted me to tell you. I'm sorry. - Found anything? - No! Chuen, send two more officers over. Watch it, Cham! - Live for how long? - A few years. When are you usually home? 6 or 7 pm. Seen any strangers lately? People come here to toss their garbage. Anyone suspicious? Think harder... The old man called it in. - When will the coroner arrive? - About 10 minutes. Don't you think they're noisy? - Tell them to pipe down. We're working. - Yes, sir. Madam, calm down and speak slowly. Shut up and get out! Left hand again? He conned my money. You take up-skirt photos. Is my sister dead? Is my mom going to jail? Newspapers from 2 years ago. Why keep it? Let him in. Thank you. Let me introduce you. Will Ren. Remember I told you he won the shield? He'll be the head of the team. Cham Lau. Everyone calls him Cham. Very experienced. He'll follow your lead. You can learn from him. Have a seat. Carry on. The severed hand found yesterday belonged to a woman. Left hand. According to the autopsy, it was severed by a rusty, blunt tool. Same as the case from two weeks ago. When will the suspect dump the body? Maybe we just haven't found it. Perhaps the victim is still alive. Hospitals have no record of her. With a wound like that, she must be confined to bed. How about backstreet doctors? Did you investigate? This is not a movie. Do you notice a smell at the two crime scenes? The smell of decaying bodies? The smell of garbage. In any case, the smell is a clue. Everyone keep your eyes open. Dig through all garbage in the area. I don't want to have a third case! Tong, clean up the desk for Will sir. Move to the other desk. Thanks! What's wrong? I have a wisdom tooth coming in. The first victim was a missing person. A call girl. The second victim has not been identified. We don't know anything about her. Cham sir, how would you investigate? On foot. Pay attention everyone. Is this where the murder actually took place? Found any rusty tools? Search carefully. - Maybe we can find other hands and feet. - Yes, sir. Sir, do you need help? No, thanks. What a pain! You're in my way! You won't find anything here. There's nothing here. East City Daily, 2015-11-26 Saturday. From two years ago. It's not the right smell. Garbage smells can be categorized? It's Cham, Crime Unit. How is the report? The prints on the second severed hand. We know the second victim's identity. She was released from prison 2 years ago. But she got involved in fights and robberies. In and out of the girl's home. Nothing we can help her. How about her family? They hate each other. No one cares about her. Friends? Anyone knows her whereabouts? To! You forgot your bag. - Thanks. - Go for it. - Got it. - Bye. If you have any further information, Please contact us. - No problem. Thank you. Social Security Field Units. Wait. Was that Wong To? Yes. - When was she released? - Couple of weeks ago. She's now working at a garage. She was well-behaved in prison, so her sentence was reduced. Sir, is something wrong? Thank you. Who's Wong To? Aren't we going back to the precinct? Go buy an ice pack for your tooth. It'll make you feel better. And get me some smokes. - Where's Wong To? - She's not here. She's dead already. What? How do I know? You're crazy. You will break my hand. You're crazy. You'll break my arm! Crazy! You broke my hand! - What are you doing? - Where is she? Let him go! Tonight. Union Garage. Why are you looking for her? What case is it? Cham Lau. I'm talking to you! Tell me what is happening. Boss Spark! Go to hell! Get to work! Put the car in the cargo. Hurry! Get to work! Stand back... Hurry! Cops! Run! Thanks! I only stole a car. Why kill me? I served my time! What more do you want? Stop it! You're crazy! - Where are my clothes? - Still in the dryer. They're still hot. Thanks! What's your hurry? The earliest bus. - Anywhere. - $120. Outrageous! Cops are humans too. We have emotions. When provoked, we can get hotheaded. It's understandable. Sir, we're not ordinary people. We carry guns to enforce the law. Even if the girl killed his wife, he can't take the law into his own hands. I don't want an officer arrested. You are right. Do as you see fit. Thank you, sir. Give me back the gun! Give me back the gun! Give it back! You really think you're still fit to be a cop? Stop the car! Pick up! CIB reported second victim's metro card was just used. Where? She's still alive. Excuse me. What's going on? Have you seen this girl? No. I need some change. $20. Noted. Sir, her metro card was just used again. What's wrong with you? Does this card belong to you? Where? I found it in here. - Take him back. - Yes sir. What are you doing? - Cordon off the street. - Yes, sir. Call the medical examiner. Not the bodies from the earlier cases. Different tattoo. We're at the scene where a female body was found. The area has been sealed off by the Police. I'm sorry. Miss, what is the problem? Massive hemorrhage is cause of death. We found rust on the wound. The cut is not clean but rough. Probably caused by a blunt object. She was sexually assaulted before death. Her nasal mucosa was ruptured. She's probably a ketamine addict. Time of her death? About a week ago. Thanks. She's not a legal resident. Immigration has no records of her. Probably an illegal immigrant. One was a call girl. The other an ex-con. This one is a drug addict. Without an identity. All social outcasts. The killer is either insane or a drug addict. Track down the drug dealers. Maybe they know the victim. I already apologized. Can you forgive me? I can be your informer. Is this enough? Brother Spark, Grey-Bear, Car theft... 66980177. 93567253. Man-Sing, Mei-Sing... Fake credit cards. 76589755. 97567253. 9358... Breaker, 9722... 9653. It's payback time. I want my wife to recover. I want my daughter back. I'll do anything if you can help me. Such early morning. What is it? Why am I arrested for taking my daughter to school? Quiet! Don't talk. Squat down. Everyone squat down. Don't talk. Squat down. So? Brother Spark, Grey-Bear... Man-Sing, Mei-Sing, Breaker. Smuggling, fake credit card, drug dealer, gambling... They're all here. Did I get them all? You want me to die? Thank you. Thank you for your cooperation. - Take Ms. Wong away. - Yes, sir. Ms. Wong can go now. Watch out. That way please, Ms. Wong. - This way. - Watch your step. Let Ms. Wong through! Let Ms. Wong through! Took another beating? Get me the dirt on the drug dealers. Okay. Everything is here. Where you going? I don't want to die. It's fine. That's all the help we need. You may go. You still have a choice. No need to do this. I don't know who's who. Who is this? Police! Stand there. Go inside, you are pregnant. Come here. - Do you know her? - I don't know her. - Is she your client? - I don't know. - Give me your ID card. - Leave my clients alone. You need information, right? I haven't seen this girl before. Not my kind of clients. Talk to Ghost at Sai King Street. Maybe he knows. - Bring a friend. - Will do! Police! Stop! Stop! What's wrong with you? Do you know her? Look again! Is she your client? - She's Coco's client. - Where is Coco? It's not easy to find that bitch. Get your priorities straight! I'm sure you know where Coco is. If I find her, are we even? Who is this? It's me, To! Bitch! Let go of me! - You rat! - Let go of me! Do you know her? Look carefully. She is your client. What proof do you have? Says who? - What happened to you? - Accident when I was young. What a coincidence. We found a dead body with a missing hand. We also found two hands. Both are left hand. Did you chop them off? You did it out of jealousy. Right? You chopped off the hands when victims were alive. Did you get high? Do you have a kinky fetish? Or sexual need? You acted alone? You couldn't have done it. Who did it? Your boyfriend? Covering for him? Two rubbish want love and romance. Got bored and decided to try 3P? Rape and murder. We're not as crazy as you. Yes, we are rubbish. So what? In this world, only he cares about me. Don't leave me. You won't know how it feels to be treated like trash. Nobody wants us. He stares at the photo and mumbles: Okaa-san... (Mother). He speaks Japanese? So he did this? - Crazy! - Let me guess... You brought those girls to him. That's crazy. That's crazy. That's crazy. Let's go back to the precinct. Where's his hideout? In the park behind the market. Let's go. You can leave. I... It's him. Bitch! Get her! Stop! Stay where you are! You're dead! Open up! - You little bitch! - Open up! Open the door! Come. Grizzly, get everyone to the alley. Now! Why did you abandon me? Bitch. Stop. Move! Bitch! Where to? Where are you going? What's your hurry? Please don't kill me. Please don't kill me. Please. Go to hell! Putting up a fight? Go to hell! Putting up a fight? Help! You're dead meat, bitch! Help! Stop! Police! Stop! Help! Help! Come out! Come out! Move! Stop! Move! Do it! Come on. Go ahead! Give me the gun. Go away. Give me the gun. Wong To! Wong To! Wong To! What happened? Wong To took my gun! Stop! Where's my gun? Where is it? I don't know. Give me back. Wong To! - Where is my gun? - I don't know. Where is it? - Where is it? - I think I dropped it. Where is the gun? - Where is it? - Why do you treat me like this? I am asking you where is the gun? I'm really scared... I can't stand it. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. - I really don't wanna die. - Where is the gun? If we can't find the gun, you're screwed! Please forgive me. Move. The killer was here. Where is she? Where? Was she taken by the killer? Step back! Don't interfere with police investigation. Please step back! Did you call the Police? Yes sir, a girl was lying over there covered in blood. - You can't go in. - Fellow officer! Certified. Call the coroner's van. - Roger! - Thanks! Control. Stiff checks out. Call the coroner's van. Roger! What are you doing? - Who are you calling? - Reporting that I lost my gun. Are you crazy? Another victim. Wong To is missing and I lost my gun. You want to get sacked? We'll work it out. Like what? We'll find a way to fix it. Don't turn yourself in. Let me deal with Chief. Take a rest first. Will. Look after your wife. What happened? It's fine. You go home first. Will. Chui. What now, Cham? Give me immigration records of Japanese tourists from last 3 years. - Not following the procedure again? - I'll send you the form later. Here's everything you want. One Japanese visitor overstayed for 9 months. We can't locate him. Who are you? I am the landlord. I thought you were the tenant. Is that him? Yes. I haven't seen him in 6 months. He's behind in rent. - How can I find him? - He doesn't have a phone. I thought I'd wait for him to come back for his things and evict him. Please forgive me! Eat. Come on. I said eat! Let go! Cham, I found something. Come! Have a look. A shoe print. I just found it here. It's the same as the one at last night's crime scene. I tried it several times. Look. He should be wearing worn-out shoes. Come to think of it, the other night, I saw a guy collecting garbage. Maybe he was the killer. He probably found my gun. This should be his shoe print. Is that him? It was too dark to get a good look. Did you find him? He was evicted for not paying his rent. Collecting garbage. No money. Wearing a worn out shoe. He should be a street sleeper. Let's find him. There are lots of homeless in this area. We'll find all of them. Let's go. On foot. Wong To is running out of time. The killer took the subway. It was easy just carrying a hand. But not possible when carrying a body. He lives nearby. Have you seen this guy? Have you seen this guy? Okaa-san (Mother). Okaa-san. Okaa-san. Miss. Call for backup! Don't act alone. Call for backup! Look after her. Where's the girl? Damn! Think I'm stupid? Think I'm stupid? Sir. The killer's gun belongs to me. The gun the killer found has a different serial number. It belongs to Cham. It was Cham who lost his gun. Cham Lau 0811. Will Ren 2904. Cham Lau 2904 Will Ren 0811. Wong To. Cham wanted me to tell you. I'm sorry. I forgive you. Please live well.
