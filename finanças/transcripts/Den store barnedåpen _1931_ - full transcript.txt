It's six o'cIock, AIviIde. You have to get up. All right, Petra. l'm already up. -Good morning, Petra. -Good morning. -Did you get home Iate Iast night? -Yes, but we had a Iot of fun. You shouId be a bit carefuI with Hans. He's not very trustworthy, I hear. What do you mean? We are engaged. So wiII he maybe take you to the priest and have the banns pubIished? Or maybe you didn't ask him? I guess you don't want to answer me. Yes, but he doesn't have the time right now. He hasn't got a job on a ship yet either. -Aren't you going to eat anything? -No, I'm not hungry. -Here. You have to eat. -Don't be angry with me, Petra. -I'm so tired today. -Just have your fun, girI. You get ugIy and oId before you know it. I just want you to be carefuI. Men aren't aIways the way you think they are. But Hans is different from the rest. We'd better hurry. Good morning! -Good morning, Georgine. -Good morning. -You're here today as weII? -I have to keep on as Iong as I can. You clumsy fool! Do l have to feed such a moron?! You witless, stupid, sickly clod! Get out, and stay out! Just stay out in the street tonight! You idiot! Wretch! -You poor girI! -Just take it easy, now. What is the matter with her? Now she's got what she deserved for her sins! Why couIdn't they have waited untiI they got married? Yes, you probabIy know aII about it, right? Because no man wouId ever touch you, even with a stick. -What are you saying? -You're just envious. It's not easy when you're young and pretty. And it's not exactIy fun for Georgine. Working and struggIing aII day Iong. No wonder that when she meets her Ioved one in the evening... -WeII, you know nothing about it. -But you do, of course! You bet I do! I know scores of things. Good evening, HaraId. But you're soaked! Why don't you stay home in weather Iike this? Auntie has got a fit again. She toId me to stay out tonight. What are you saying? What for? I dropped the coffee pot on her corn, and she got mad. What a monster. And you, who are so tense. Come up to our pIace. The coffee was steaming hot, of course. Get your coat and vest off and hang them up to dry. Maybe you couId Iight the stove, so we can make some coffee. Okay. But you're wet through and through! Take off your shirt. I'II Iend you a bIouse. -It'II probabIy dry soon. -Nonsense. -Get it off, boy! -Then Iet go of me. Get inside, boy. Come on, now. Put on this bIouse. -This one? -No objections now! But... Are you going out again? Yes, I promised Hans to go out with him tonight as weII. He wiII pick me up in a IittIe whiIe. He's turned your head around completely. But l did warn you! Go and get yourseIf some coffee! I think I'd rather put on this shirt again. How obstinate you are! Come here now. But... My goodness! He was wet as a drowning cat, and you know how nervous he is. Come and sit down. Come on, now, you fooI. Don't be so vain! Never mind her, HaraId. -Hi! -What are you doing here? Just Iike I thought. You're going to see AIviIde. What's with you? I go wherever I want. No, you don't! Not after what I toId you the other day. Nonsense. Just go home. It's not nonsense. I'm up the duff, and it's your fauIt! You know more men than me. Hans! You know it's you and no one eIse. -Come with me, Hans. -Go home, I said! -I've got no more time for you now. -But you can't Ieave me Iike this! Go now, or eIse... Hans is here! Good evening, AIviIde. Are you ready? I'II just put on my cap. ShouId we Ieave at once? Let's wait a whiIe. It's a IittIe earIy. -PIease come in. -Thank you. Good evening. Good evening. -Won't you sit down? -Thank you. Why don't you just Ieave? I can do the dishes tomorrow, Petra. So... Let's go, then. AIviIde... Don't forget what I've toId you. Goodbye. Goodbye, then. WeII now. Have you faIIen asIeep? Is AIviIde engaged to Hans? She seems to think so. But I don't. -I don't Iike him. -Me neither. If I hadn't been so nervous, I wouId have twisted his head off. -What has he done to you? -He hasn't done anything to me. I hardIy know him. Look, it's the Cuckoo! Now he's gotten hoId of AIviIde. -You mean Hans? -You caII him ''the Cuckoo''? Yes. You know, the cuckoo Ieaves its eggs in other nests. -What are you saying? -Don't you understand? As Iate as today, the third IittIe cuckoo arrived. -Georgine had a baby at the factory. -Are you serious? -Her too? -Poor girI. No, I don't think you wiII get any empIoyment, HaraId. You are too nervous. You don't know how terribIe it feeIs to be this way, Petra. It's aImost Iike I'm not even human. -That's pure nonsense. -No, it's not. Just Iook at the way AIviIde is treating me. I'm aIso a man, even if I'm nervous. AIviIde? What do you mean? I'm sure she wouId have made a fuzz if Hans had seen her undress. I'm not so sure about that. Aren't you? -Where are you going? -My shirt must have dried by now. -And it's Iate. -You can't Ieave now. -Stay here tonight. -I can't stay here, Petra. Don't be siIIy. You can't waIk the streets in this weather. Let's find something for you to Iie on tonight. It may be a bit hard, but it's better than waIking the streets. You're so kind to me, Petra. -SIeep weII. -You too. Good night. -Here you are. -Thank you. It's cIosing time. But we have to drink up first. Cheers! -Drink up, now. -No, I think I had enough. That's enough. Cheers. -Drink up, now! -Don't spiII on my dress! I'II drink it myseIf. I aImost think I had a bit too much. -Why are you so difficuIt tonight? -I'm afraid Petra might hear us. -The Iast time, it was very cIose. -I'II be quiet as a mouse. Don't you Iove me anymore, AIviIde? How can you ask me that? You shouId know better. -That's not the probIem. -Then what's the matter? Promise me to come to the priest and have the banns pubIished? What's the hurry? I've toId you I'II come with you when I have the time. WeII, if you don't beIieve me... Don't be angry, Hans. -Then Iet me come with you. -Okay. Come on, then. Let us finish this discussion now. Let us enjoy ourseIves awhiIe. Enjoy ourseIves? There you go again! Never an admonishing word! You aIways just enjoy yourseIf in the middIe of aII this fiIthiness! There's no point in me admonishing these unmarried mothers. My words do not have retroactive force! I taIk to my parishioners before they go out into Iife! And if they don't heed my words, it's their own choice. But my sense of duty does not end there! No. It runs wiId, beyond aII Iimits! You think Iove equaIs indifference with a smiIe! No, these peopIe need to be chastised and punished! -They must be chastised! -You are so crueI! You enjoy chastising unhappy peopIe. Now they are fighting again, Evensen. Soon he wiII destroy our whoIe business for us. He's scaring everyone away with his strictness. The church is just about empty every time he is preaching. Just a few oId women attend, and there's no profit in that. What kind of taIk is this, Evensen?! You don't seem to reaIize how serious this is. You have never been a merchant. But I have. I was a huckster for many years before I joined the cIergy. And how did I behave? Did I admonish peopIe in the store? Or was I rude to my customers in their own homes? No, then I couId have cIosed down the store. But he...! Soon we have to Ieave the business to the probate court. He doesn't understand that if we're not poIite to our customers, - - they wiII go to our competitors. -Competitors? -ExactIy. Methodists, Adventists, The SaIvation Army, gIossoIaIists... Mormons... Whatever aII these charIatans are caIIed. -And maybe their goods is better. -Goods? Yes. Baptisms, confirmations, weddings, funeraIs... It's aII free trade merchandise. One thing they've got, which we don't trade with any more. They've got the oId heII, which the Ministry stoIe from us. Come in. Is it you, Georgine? Are you here to order a baptism? Yes, that's right. Let's see what we can do for you. Fetch the priest, pIease. Sit down and wait, pIease. Idar. You don't understand my father or the peopIe around here. -But what is wrong? -I wiII teII you what is wrong. Your father passes through Iife with a pIeasant wink in his eye. And the resuIt... My God, what I have seen and experienced. -What have you seen? -I can't describe it in a few words. But now I no Ionger wish to remain a witness to this. -I want to practise among them! -You wiII heIp them? Comfort them? Yes, I wiII heIp them. But not destroy what IittIe is Ieft of them. They need to be chastised. -Isn't the priest here? -No, he just Ieft. -Is anything the matter? -Evensen asked me to get the priest. Someone wants to taIk to him about a baptism. Then I'd better step in and do your father's work. It's not easy for him, Tine. No, and he doesn't make things easy for others either. Oh dear. Come cIoser. -You're here regarding a baptism? -Yes. -Are you married? -No. No, of course not. Don't you know you have no right to bear a chiId before you're married? That you have committed an unforgivabIe sin? That's great. Just abuse the customers! This is revoIting! TerribIe! You have to marry your Iover as soon as possibIe! Understand? -But... -No objections! Now Ieave! -But... -Go, and come back tomorrow. And then I advise you to bring your Iover with you! -But... -Go, I said! You... Amateur! So... -Did you meet him? -No. He has gone away. Gone away? Has he found work on a ship? There you see. Just Iike I thought. He didn't want to go to the priest with you. Good thing he hasn't gotten you up the duff. Like so many others. You've heard what they caII him? They caII him ''The Cuckoo''. Because he Iays eggs in others' nests, and then runs away. This was reaIIy sad, AIviIde. -WouId you promise me something? -You know you can trust me. If Hans doesn't want to marry me when he comes back... I don't want peopIe to say: ''There goes another one who got fooIed by The Cuckoo.'' No, but... Promise me you won't teII anyone about my condition. And when it becomes visibIe, and someone asks you... Then teII them you don't know who the father is. Yes, I promise. This was reaIIy sad, AIviIde. Thank God! He finaIIy Ieft. -So he's visited you, now? -Yes. I don't know what my sins are. But he's sat here and chastised me for one whoIe hour. He can't be quite right. I'm not going to church as Iong as he is around! He's entering no. 8. Lucky peopIe! Big ship accident! The whoIe crew perished! TERRIBLE ACCIDENT AT SEA LAST N IGHT! Norwegian ship ran ashore in ferocious storm off Scottish coast Yes, that's the ship that Hans saiIed with. BeIieve me, he wouId never have married you. But I did Iove him. You haven't toId anyone that Hans was the father of this poor kid? No, I haven't. But now that he's dead... No. EspeciaIIy not when he is dead. You hear me? Don't teII anyone! Just caIm down, now. I just don't understand what to do with the kid when I'm at work. -You'd better do as so many others. -No. Never, Petra! But... CouIdn't you Iook after the kid? Look after the kid? Me? Yes. You're not abIe to work anyway. Then you couId Iive here, and earn your food. And you wouId be rid of this aunt of yours. -PIease do it, HaraId! -Yes, but... It's just so sad. If onIy it had been my own chiId... Then cIaim it is yours! If anyone asks me, I won't deny it. You reaIIy think peopIe wouId beIieve...? -Why shouIdn't they? -Of course! They'II beIieve that you and AIviIde are engaged. They wouId see you in a different Iight, HaraId. HoId him. But you do understand there can be nothing between us - - even if peopIe think that we are engaged? Yes... I understand, AIviIde. Are you aIready awake? Did you sIeep weII? You probabIy dreamt about Daddy. Daddy Ioves you so much. AImost as much as he Ioves Mummy. But don't teII anyone. Because Mummy doesn't Iove me. Hey! That's a good boy! Oh, the gIass feII over. It's dirty. Let's have some bread. You're going to be big and strong. Not Iike me. The girIs wiII run after you, and everyone wiII want to give you work. You'II be a foreman. No, an engineer. But then you'II forget me. Or wiII you heIp me get a job? I'm not unwiIIing to work. I'm just a bit nervous. Here come Mummy and auntie Petra! I can smeII that food is ready. Here he is! He's been so good. LittIe Laddie. Did you miss your Mummy? Poor IittIe Laddie, who's been aIone the whoIe day. Don't you cry now. Remember you're supposed to be at the priest's office before 7. I'd aImost forgotten. How cIever you are. And you're keeping everything so tidy. The kid too. And you're such a good cook! Oh, that's nothing much. Let's eat now. -Here you go, AIviIde. -Thank you. -DeIicious food, HaraId. -You think so? I have to admit I'm not Iooking forward to seeing the priest. What if we meet the chapIain? WeII, he won't bite your nose off. But remember what happened to Georgine. She actuaIIy feII iII afterwards. -Do I have to come? -Of course you do. You have to cIaim you're the father, and aIso sign the papers. -Can't we wait a whiIe, Petra? -No, we can't postpone it again. I'II come with you and taIk to the chapIain, if he's at the office. -That's nice of you, Petra. -Yes, you'II handIe it weII. You remember what to teII them if they ask why we don't get married? Yes, I remember. Evensen, you know this area so weII. CouId you give me some addresses? Of the worst sinners among our parishioners? -Yes, I couId give you some. -TeII me who they are. I know a man who's unfaithfuI, and beats his wife and kids. Where does he Iive? I have to taIk to him! Just up the street. The manager at the paper miII. He donated 1 000 kroner for a new church organ. But, Evensen! That's not the kind of peopIe I'm referring to! I mean workers. Oh, but they never have the time to do anything wrong. They work in the daytime and sIeep at night. And you're innocent when you sIeep. Come in. -What do you want? -It's about a baptism. Sit down. -Are you married? -No. But it's not my kid that's going to be baptized. -The parents sit out there waiting. -Why don't they come in? I thought it wouId be the safest if I went in first. I have heard that you are aIways so angry. And I wouId Iike you to be a bit gentIe with them. I understand. So they're not married, those two? -Evensen, teII them to come in. -Be gentIe with HaraId, vicar. He is so sensitive. It's his nerves, you see. Sit down! Young man, you are this girI's fiancé? Yes. Thank you. Why don't you get married, and get out of this abomination? I cannot get married right now. I'm so nervous. But you feeI strong enough to have a chiId?! Yes, thank you. This is unacceptabIe! You have to get married as soon as possibIe! We can't get married yet, because we're not prepared for it. -You are not prepared? -No. We cannot afford to. ShouIdn't the two of us agree to start a new Iife? -The two of us? -I mean you, of course. Give me your hand, my young friend. Promise me that you'II persuade your fiancée to marry you. -Yes. -But... What's got into you? -I don't want to! -What?! Here are two forms. One for each of you. FiII them out, and then we'II pubIish the banns next Sunday. -Yes. No... -Put down those papers, HaraId! You hear me?! That's right. Don't you reaIize your shame? Your depraved, sinfuI Iife? Don't you feeI that it's a shame for your innocent chiId? PIease heIp me, Petra! The two of you may Ieave. I'II taIk to the priest. -Why don't you Ieave as weII? -I'm not finished yet. I want the priest to deIete my name from the Church register. -I want to Ieave the state church. -Leave? The state church? So you intend to become a compIete heathen? Not exactIy. I've become reIigious. Therefore I want my name removed. -This is ridicuIous! -Is it? This might be unfortunate for you. PeopIe are sick of your scoIdings. PeopIe want to be Ieft in peace! Goodbye! Evensen, it's 7 o'cIock. CIose the office. If we continue Iike this, we'II go bankrupt. What got into you? You promised the chapIain we wouId get married. -Have you gone mad? -I got so nervous. Just throw away those papers. Throw them away! I Ieft the church. And he can bet his Iife I'm going to get more peopIe to do the same. You shouId aIso Ieave. The more peopIe who Ieave, the worse for him. We'II get Agnes, ThoraIfa and many others with us. We'II start a strike! Let's go to ThoraIfa right away. Yes, Iet's do it, Petra. Take the kid home, HaraId. We'II soon be there. Look. There's HaraId with the kid. AIviIde couId have anyone, and then she chooses him! I guess there's something speciaI about him. Yes, I suppose so. I'II just hide these papers. Right there. You never know... Do you know how to swim? You'd better not drown. But maybe you'II fIoat. You're aImost as fat as your Daddy. SpIash, spIash... That's fun. Let's jump a bit. Don't you want any more? You have to drink, so you'II get big and strong. Okay, if you don't want to... I bet you're tired. Let's go to bed now. Good night. SIeep weII, Laddie. I'm not a ghost. Is AIviIde here? What are you doing here? What have you got in the cradIe? Or are you just bIuffing? -Is it a boy or a girI? -What eIse wouId it be? Cover him. I'd better Ieave. Have you seen Georgine? Is she engaged? No, she's been iII. And AIviIde had the same disease. ReaIIy? -Maybe something contagious? -Yes, it was contagious. Here's what was wrong with them. And now maybe you understand. I think I have to Ieave now. I'm busy. How come you're in a hurry, aII of a sudden? Now we're twelve people who will leave the church. But... My goodness! Yes, it's me. Your ex-boyfriend. How beautifuI you have become. Much more narrow around the waist. -Let me feeI. -Let go of me! Don't you touch me! -Don't you dare touch AIviIde! -Listen to him! Watch it, or I'II put you in the cradIe with the other baby. Stay out of it, HaraId. This is none of your business. Take him up. Make him stop. Here's your apron! I'm not going to be your maid anymore! Just grab your kid. I'm not staying another day! -What do I do with this? -You just hoId on to it! I've been up so many nights. I have washed your kid! I've been to the priest's office and pretended to be his father! Do you know why? Because I thought you were Iying on the ocean fIoor. And then you're aIive, pretending nothing has happened! You have no shame! That's no way to handIe a kid! Look here! This is the way to hoId him! Grab your chiId! Are you running away, Cuckoo?! Listen to me! Here's your kid! Why do you sit there crying? Just go to your bowIegged Cuckoo! You'II probabIy find him if you go Iooking for him. I don't ever want to see him again, HaraId! But pIease don't Ieave the kid and me. Didn't you hear me? I'm sick of this! Didn't you hear? I want to move out. And right away! Don't be siIIy, HaraId! Don't be angry with me, HaraId! You have been much more kind to me than I deserved. What do you mean? I haven't been kind. I'm a man! HaraId! Don't go! Wait, HaraId! Listen to me! Hey, a fight! The cops! Just come back again, and you'II get some more! -Name and address? -HaraId Trosterud. 7 Østgårdsgate. What are you saying? Are you happy that Hans is back? And that you never want to see him again? I don't understand any of this. Don't you understand that I was aIways thinking of him? I thought he was bigger and boIder than anyone eIse. -And now? -Now? He crouched, and sneaked off Iike a wet cat. Oh, if onIy HaraId wouIdn't be angry with me. It won't be easy to find someone who can Iook after your kid - - and take care of the house Iike he did. No. That too. That too? When he threw the apron at me, and cIenched his fist in Hans' face... It was Iike I saw him for the very first time. What do you mean? I think I have come to Iove HaraId without noticing. I can't beIieve my own ears! -Are you reaIIy serious? -Yes. But don't you dare teII anyone! Here comes HaraId. Evening! Here I am. -Look at you! -What has happened? I've been fighting, AIviIde. For the first time in my Iife. I fought The Cuckoo! We both got a beating. My God. I'm strong! But why haven't any of you toId me this before? -But what about your nerves? -My nerves are fine! It's just something you made me beIieve. You're not angry with me for beating The Cuckoo, are you? I just couIdn't stop myseIf. -Did you hit him hard? -No. He'II survive. But... Is he awake again? -ShouIdn't we put him to bed? -I guess so. Wait a moment. He can't Iie Iike this. You're a much better mother to him than I am. Won't you Iet me heIp you? There are some dry cIoths on the cIothes Iine in the kitchen. CouId you fetch those, AIviIde? How extraordinary! What does this mean? A written resignation from the state church from ThoraIfa Jensen? -Her too? -What do you mean? I'm afraid you wiII find more Ietters of the same kind. Are you serious? Yes, you're right. -A resignation from Agnes Johansen. -Her too? But Evensen... This is astonishing. Petra Johnsen, Georgine Hansen, Agnes AvIangrud... AIviIde KarIsen, Lissy Engebretsen, HaraId Trosterud... What on earth is this supposed to mean? It means that the chapIain has started waking peopIe up. -The chapIain? -Yes. And he sure has woken them! You can't work here if you've got a chiId with you. Look at the water. Excuse me, but aren't you Mr. HaraId Trosterud? Yes. -I heard you Ieft the state church? -No... Yes... That's right. -And the chiId has not been baptized? -No. You shouId come to me and my congregation. You'II have to taIk to Petra about it. She's in charge of reIigion in our home. Then I wiII come around soon. I know where you Iive. -Goodbye and so Iong. -Goodbye. Look over there. Mummy's in that buiIding. But Miss Jensen, now that you have Ieft the state church... That's enough. I toId you I wiII think about it. Okay, then. We have a meeting on Saturday in our premises. WiII you come? -Like I said, I'II think about it. -Then you'II be there, I'm sure. Goodbye, Miss Jensen. StiII more resignations. No, I don't understand this. It's more and more obvious that these peopIe are totaIIy aIien to me. No, I don't understand this. Something has to be done. But what? Right you are. Something has to be done. But probabIy l have to do it. -So you promise to join us? -Yes, but now you have to Ieave. This time you're too Iate, my dear OIsen. Maybe you're right, but you never know. This is outrageous! I'm totaIIy confused, Evensen. I don't know if I shouId become a Mormon or a gIossoIaIist. This is the judgment coming over you, my girI. Why didn't you stay with us? We treated you so weII. -Don't you start as weII. -Yes, now it's my turn. It's a reaI shame the way you have acted. I've got nothing to do anymore. No wedding. No baptism. Just the occasionaI corpse coming by for a funeraI. Come to your senses now, and think of your own best. Come to us! How fortunate that I met you! You didn't join our Iast meeting? I hope you turn up next Saturday! But... And I forgot to give you your bottIe! How patient you are! Here. There you go. Have a drink now. Don't you scream, now. Then they wiII discover that I bring you here. And then I'II get fired. Grab the bottIe yourseIf. I have to go now. Bye now. Oh, how sweet! You must not hoId the bottIe that way. Then you won't get anything out of it. You are the cutest thing I've ever seen! Eat a IittIe now. Here you are in our garden, and we know nothing about you. -You have to understand... -Oh no. Him too! When wiII you finaIIy reaIize that you are too Iate? You never know. -Stay away now. -You'd better watch it! You think you can meddIe with my affairs forever? -Your affairs? -ExactIy. You think you can stop me from going where I want to? You think you can stop me from doing what I'm supposed to? -Watch it now! -No, you watch it! What a suntan you've got. HaraId, where are you taking the kid every day? He's changed compIeteIy IateIy. Oh, I... I'm just taking him out. Good evening. Here I am again. Oh, it's you. There's nobody home. I distinctIy see someone in the drawing-room. Good evening, sister. Do not be afraid of your brother. I bIess you and your precious offspring. Here I stand, and I say unto you: You shaII come to me. You shaII be baptized anew! Baptized? I am aIready baptized. WouId you Iike to see my certificate? Do you remember that you answered? No. Come to me, and you wiII be baptized anew. I can envision you. You shaII dispose of aII your earthIy attire. Then you dress up in a white gown. You'd better drink your coffee. Then I take you by the hand and Iead you ahead. The water rises around you. It pIays around your Ioins. It snuggIes around your bosom. What is this nonsense? Are you trying to seduce the girI? What are you saying? Seduce? Sister, do I intend to seduce you? You wouIdn't have had much success! I don't want to Iisten to you. This is where I Iive, and you are not weIcome here. Is somebody waiting here too? This wiII drive me insane. It's me, your brother. I bIess you. How siIIy of me to Ieave the church! Here I stand with outstretched arms. Lean your head... WeII, I'II be... You have to Ieave now. Come back some other time, when we're not at home. Veni, vidi, vici! Which means: The DeviI waIks amongst us in the shape of a roaring Iion! WeII, the roaring has come to an end. Just get out of here! This is utterIy outrageous! Shut up, and my regards to your great grandma! This was kind of you. Don't Iet anyone eIse persuade you now. You can Iive a Christian Iife even if you're a member of the church. Don't you worry. I enroII once more. -Goodbye, and thank you. -Goodbye, and don't mention it. -I'm very happy with you, HaraId. -Thank you. I wouId Iike to offer you a reguIar job here with me. -A reguIar job here? -Yes. But then you have to Iive here. The porter's Iodge has been vacant for years. Then the IittIe one wouIdn't have to Iie aIone in its case. -You...know about him? -Yes. Ever since you first came here. Maybe that's aIso why I offer you the job, HaraId. Yes, but... You see... You have to understand... Don't answer me today. Ask your wife about it. Think about it untiI tomorrow. I don't understand why HaraId hasn't come home yet. He's usuaIIy aIways on time. He'II probabIy be here soon. WouId you Iike to Iive here? No, I guess it wouIdn't work. Not when you're the son of divorced parents, or whatever it's caIIed. I guess that's what they caII a castIe in the air. CaIm down, AIviIde. He'II probabIy be here soon. I hope nothing has happened to him. He won't be here any earIier if you stand there and wait. Come with me. Look at the IittIe doggie! Now we have to Ieave, or eIse we'II be Iate. FinaIIy. AIviIde, here he is! I've been so worried about you, HaraId! Oh, HaraId. I've been so worried about you! Worried about me? Have you been worried about me, AIviIde? You don't know this, HaraId, but I Iove you so. But... AIviIde... What are you teIIing me? You can't be serious? I have come to Iove you without being aware of it, HaraId. But... AIviIde! If you want to, I wouId Iike to marry you. Marry me? Is this for reaI? Is this reaIIy you, AIviIde? Is this me? Is this the two of us? -Oh, AIviIde! -Oh, HaraId! Yes, Petra. HaraId and I are going to get married. But then we probabIy cannot Iive here any Ionger? No way! We wiII Iive in a house. With a garden! We'II Iive in a viIIa, I teII you. You, the chiId, and I. -Now he's gone compIeteIy insane. -Cut it out now, HaraId. No, I'm serious. I've become permanentIy empIoyed. Look. This is my saIary for the first five days. But why haven't you toId us before? I was so scared I wouId be fired, and that wouId have been so sad. Wait a moment. I've got an idea. Remember these forms? You toId me to throw them away. But now we need them anyway! Right? Stay away from here, you IittIe rat! -This is my district! -I'II report you! This is iIIegaI! This is free competition! Go hide yourseIf somewhere! ...I...s...e...n. -I shouId sign my name there? -Isn't it there? No, over there. Getting married sure isn't easy! -ls anybody home? -But... Isn't it Evensen? Good evening, Evensen. Nice to see a decent man. And just now, when we need you. We don't know where to write HaraId's name on this form. HeIp us, pIease. -But this is a wedding form! -ExactIy. AIviIde and HaraId are getting married. -But you're not state church members. -No... But we can enroII again. -WouId you reaIIy Iike to? -Yes! Maybe you think the church is Iike a cIub? What if we don't want you back again? But, Evensen... You can't be serious about this? I can understand it if you don't want me anymore, but... You cannot stop these two from getting married! Of course not. Just come back to us in the church. -You too, Petra. -Thank God. This has been a strenuous time. -HeIp us with the paperwork now. -Of course. This is business. Now we wiII get it together. The bishop finds it necessary to criticize the chapIain's conduct. He is ordered to carry out his duties in a much more considerate manner. But I have considered it my duty to criticize sin wherever I found it. Then wouIdn't it have been right to start with us, Idar? -With us? -Yes. With you and me. -I don't understand you. -The two of us are not without sin. You mean we have done nothing wrong? You are right. We have been carefuI. But can we cIaim that we are free of guiIt? I, for one, do not dare to. I'm no different from the other young girIs. But you, Idar... Have you never yearned? You must not ask me! I know that you have Ionged to possess me, Idar. I have read it in your eyes. Why be ashamed? AII human beings are aIike. Both those out there, and we. It's onIy the appearances of our Iives taking different forms. WonderfuI Astrid... You are right! Quiet! Stay out there tiII we open! Get out of here! It's a fuII house out there, chapIain. More peopIe who want to Ieave the church? -No, they want to join us again. -Join us again?! Yes. It's the same peopIe who Ieft. I know, 'cause I got them back again. You mean you have Ied them onto the right path? No, but I have made them join the church again. -By what means? -I have made a Iot of promises. Maybe I cannot keep them, but that's what it took, you see. But what have you done? I toId them that if they did not join us again, - - they wouId be fired from the factory. And I promised that the chapIain wouId be equaIIy gentIe - - whether the mother was married or not. I have to say you've been generous with your promises. You can't be modest if you want to get customers. Maybe I promised them too much? May I Iet them in, chapIain? They're aII waiting. Can't I Iet them in? PIease, chapIain. As you wish. Let them in. Enter when I caII your names. Petra, AIviIde and HaraId first. No, don't push! Take it easy. Sit down here. There's the Cuckoo, HaraId. Don't do anything. Remember we're in church. AII right. We don't care about him anymore. Are you going to get married, or baptize your chiId? We thought it best to baptize the kid first. That's reasonabIe. And how about you? -We're going to get married. -Very reasonabIe. -And the two of you? -Both get married and baptize. ExceedingIy reasonabIe. And are you going to get married, or have the chiId baptized? I don't have a chiId, and I'm never going to get married. ExtremeIy reasonabIe.
