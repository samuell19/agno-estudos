"The heart is happy while the face is blue" "The groom and the bride" "I bought a coffin and a ding" Tan always recommended you and said that you were the best photographer in Hong Kong. In fact, it is true to its reputation. Look at this set of photos. No matter as if the tone, modelling or style they really are all so different. You made her look so beautiful. No wonder she says that we must have you to take the picture. Mr Chen, how about this? Tan always believed in your skills which you know that too. As for me, I'll be the middleman this time. I'll hold exhibitions of your works in Mainland China and Hong Kong what do you think? Well, I'd like to think about it. Mr Chen, it is such a great opportunity. Don't you think it's a pity if you miss it? And I think it's actually... I think that since we're enjoying the coffee let's not talk about something so serious. We can leave it in the office some other time. Zhi-cheng. Excuse me, I'll be right back. Tan is good to you, she said she had a surprise for you. Hello, brother. I want two balloons! Hello, Madam Liu. It's almost dinner, why aren't you back? Come on, come on. Let me tell you something. This assistant Qi and Mr Chen are probably a couple I don't think you have a chance. I will be getting stronger then. It's better and more challenging. And I'm not afraid of that. Don't let her go! - Sir! - Stop, that one in red. Calm down, who are you looking for? Which one? She ran away! Calm down, and please explain yourself. - She run away! - We are sorry! - He is a photographer. - Why are you blocking me? Please explain yourself, sir. He's a photographer, and I'm his assistant. Girl, it has nothing to do with you. Could you please explain yourself? Why are you blocking me? You don't have to do it. - Well, listen to me... - Don't you dare to move! I invited them from Hong Kong. Here is my card. This man is an employee of my company. - Don't give them a hard time. - So tell him to take it easy. I need you to take them aside for a while. - All right... - Don't you leave here. And get me both of their contact information the police will be here soon. All right... You should take him to get some rest first. Okay. You're a very strong man. I'm sorry... Zhi-cheng, what's wrong back then? Nothing. Nothing? Zhi-cheng? Zhi-cheng! - Hey, visiting your sister again? - Yeah. Sis! Sis! Sis, what's wrong with you? Mr Chen. What happened to Tan is not on anyone's mind. According to the police and the hospital the football hitting the mirror unexpectedly that's what caused the accident. So take care and let it go. Grandmother, grandfather, sister and brother-in-law. May you please bless Si-tong. She is a good girl I really like her. Ever since I saw that woman in red when I was 18 you all left me one by one. Now, Tan Wen is also dead. Please bless Si-tong for me. Don't let anything happen to her. Grandma? Zhi-cheng, how are you doing? Are you feeling better? No matter what, just don't hide out buy yourself. I know you're home, and I'm right outside your door. If I don't want to worry about you, just open the door. I worry about you! Hey, why are you pilling up so much garbage? Come eat your dinner and I'll take care of it. Look, clothes were scattered about. I ready can't take it. How can you stand with this mess? You need to stop drinking alone, okay? You know it's not good when you drink to middle age. I'm sorry that you always got to help me out. We are from the same pack. You are my good classmates, and not to mention a good boss. You're still here so late. Yeah, I left. Lord, please protect Chen Zhi-cheng. I think he's a particularly bad mood today who hid in a corner. I don't know what happened to him in his life, but I know you can hear me. Please comfort him with gentle hands. All the clothes in your closet are unwashed? It stink. Yeah, I was gonna save up enough for the laundry. You know what I got this. Zhi-cheng, do you remember Yue-ying. Wu Yue-ying, we went to college together. She's with me every day, my best friend. I remember she was very pretty. Well, she's a psychiatrist now. She was a heartthrob in college. I think she has a good future. What brings her up all of a sudden. She come back to Hong Kong. She haven't found an apartment yet, so just stay with me first. You said she had a pretty face and a nice body. I didn't say she had a great body. She is open-minded who studied abroad for several years. You should be careful. Why should I be careful? If you see it more often, maybe you two will get a chance to become best friends. I think... I think. It's not very convenient for her to live with you. Bother you. How come your grandmother's plate is broken? I accidentally broke it. How could you be careless with that? I'll fix it for you in a few days. I have been working myself out for you. I mean, why someone would do all his for you? Not those even worth a thank you from you? Thank you. If you really want to thank me, come with me to see the Pressed meteor shower tonight. Meteor shower? That sounds good, all right. "Ghosts are the roundup of self-fears," "people's fear of the unknown" "which becoming a manifestation" - You are back? - Yes. Looks like you got it, right? I have to thank you for that. You know what? It do scared me. I've never tried to ask him out besides work. I was afraid he would reject me. Good thing that I took your advise to be initiative. He said yes! Of course, my opinion is professional. He's so introverted. If you don't make the first move, it is long gone. I wonder if the remembers me. Psychologist are different who knows how to handle psychology so well! But I worried about being so proactive, I was afraid he'd take it too hard and resent me. No, you don't even have to think about it. You can't take another step when he's so reserved, Ten or twenty years won't do it. But you need to be a little more aggressive with him, He will respond to you once he feels your feelings. Actually, I think he likes you. You're just trying to make me feel better. I'm serious. Eva, you're so late. Bye. I saw you... Zhi-cheng! I learned first aid, wait for me. You keep an eye on him while I call an ambulance. Zhi-cheng! Zhi-cheng! Zhi-cheng? How are you doing. Are you okay? Thank you, Si-tong. He only cares about you, since we were in school back then. Fine, I'll listen to you. Try my best! That's right. Actually, I'd like to ask you. I knew you had a thing for him in college. But his eyes are always blue, I wonder what he's thinking. No one dared approach him, not even me. Why did you fall in love with him? Actually, in college, I think he has a weird personality too, who looks worrying a lot and difficult to get along with. Until he fell in the water, it's the first time I've seen him up close. After graduation, I met him again while passing out leaflets on the street Hey, is that Si-tong? Please take a look. Hello, may the Lord love you Please take one and have a look. Girl, how much do you worth? - Hold on, Sir. - You are good, too! Sir, are you all right. Zhi-cheng? Hey, stop fighting! Brother-in-law! - There is an accident! - Call the police! Hubby! Miss, you need to calm down. The death of his brother-in-law was a great shock to his sister. In less than three months, his sister was inconsolable who then killed herself in a nursing home. We started talking because of that meeting. Later, I think that he is actually a kind man with filial piety and the sense of justice too, who only not knowing how to express himself. He always looked after his sister after the accident. All right, and very artistic. Very classy and handsome, isn't it. I do not deny that being handsome is another reason, but he really was a nice guy. Do you realise that? My eyes are glowing when you talk about him. - I really like him, then. - I see. He agreed to watch the meteor shower with you tonight, so I think you have to make the most of it and hit the nail on the head. But I'm afraid, it's just the two of us tonight. Why don't you think about what to wear, pretty girl? This is a big night for both of you. Yeah, right. I am running out of time now! Calm down, I'm here. Hey, Jenny. I won't have a late-night snack with you guys tonight. The observatory says it will rain heavily tonight and I have something important to do. Yeah, good. I'll see you next time, bye. Zhi-cheng, I think life is so short which just fleeted like the meteors. So we should not wasting time in mourning the past. Well, maybe you are right. The sky you see is blue, but the sky I see is green. What? Have you seen a doctor then? No, I don't like going to the doctor. Seeing a doctor makes my heart ache. It's hard to breathe. Maybe you're too nervous. I'll go with you the next time. Not that, I wonder why too. I really don't know why. Don't be so. No matter what happens, let's face it together. All problems can be solved. I grew up seeing things that no one else could and hear what no one else can hear. It pricks me when people laugh. Here you are. For your information, Fat-girl's father is Fat-woman. I told you not to talk to him, he has the evil. So, I can't be friends with anyone. How fortunate and bitter. No, you have no problem getting along with me. Seeing those things before, my memories are fragmentary. I see a red shadow. I heard a woman laughing. Until I was 18. I saw the red ghost with my own eyes. I told my dad, he just left home after beating me. I told my sister, she don't believe me. I told my mother. She scold me loud, saying that woe betide three generations. It's my turn now. You have said that your mother is mentally unstable, it's usual for her to say things like that sometimes. You can forget about it. No. My mother saw it too, she also heard that. So, this is a big reaction. My sister blamed me on her deathbed. It is true that woe betide three generations. I'm the one who brought that ghost back. I literally killed my brother-in-law. Brothers-in-law don't deserve to die. It is my fault, I should take all the blame. No, Zhi-cheng. I was there that day, your brother-in-law's death was truly an accident. No one wants that, so don't blame yourself. Then what about Tan Wen? Don't you understand? All those who are good to me will die eventually. Tan Wen's death was even more unexpected. You shouldn't take all the blame on yourself, okay? Zhi-cheng, stop exaggerating. I'll be there for you no matter what, okay? Even if something bad happens to me, I'm not afraid... It won't! I'm always here for you. - Hello, Si-tong. - Hello. How's it going over there? It's raining hard here. I got a lot of rain here too, but I didn't bring an umbrella. I'll pick you up now, okay? Well, bye. It is Yue-ying, she said she'd come pick us up. I think those winds are a little bitter. Why do you feel that? I don't know but I just feel it. The wind is bitter today. But those winds are sweet the first day I met you. You are lying. Heavy rain. Yue-ying. Chen Zhi-cheng. Remember? Of course, I know Chen Zhi-cheng. - Just go home, okay? - Yeah. It's raining hard and you're both soaking wet. You can put on my clothes first. Thank you. It is quite fit. What meteor shower was I watching? I should check the weather report first. Just cover up with my bear. No, they're all beautiful. You first. - Hello. - Hello? Is that Miss Qi. I'd like to discuss with you about Mr Chen's solo exhibition that we talked last time. How about I ask Mr Chen to talk to you? Are you still with Mr Chen this late at night? Yes, we are. Why don't we talk about it together? Well, Mr Chen. We have talk about your solo exhibition in Hong Kong, I wonder how you think about it. I would say that you mustn't miss this good chance. You're so talented which is not supposed to be buried. Fine. By the way, Miss Liu. Let us talk about the details, okay? Yeah, he'll be absent from Hong Kong for the 20th to 25th this month. Any other time is fine. We'll get in touch tomorrow, okay? Thank you, alright. Bye. Congratulations, Mr Chen! You finally made it! You should be more aggressive to a man like him. Oh, this is a bad time. I'm sorry, I didn't see anything. I think I'm almost out of here. I got nothing special to do here, and it stopped raining now. You must be hungry after all night. I'm gonna go get some drinks, let's have a late-night snack? I'll go down and you may carry on. Can you promise me? What I told you today, don't say a word to anyone. Including her. I understand, I promise you. Only if I get your permission, or I won't say a word to anyone about you. So good that you are washing the dishes. Here, please eat something. I don't feel like eating fruit right now. Of course I know, here's your favourite wingtips! How did you know I liked wingtips? It's a nice environment that perfect for a psych clinic. Yue-ying said, privacy and quietness are the most important things in psych clinic. That wouldn't distract the patient. Do you want me to help you out? No, I can do it myself. I'll go get the other stuff then. My psych clinic has to be very focused on patient's security and trust. So, everything has to be in order which won't be left lying around. Also, the sound is important. Patients are easily disturbed if there is a lot of noise, even my own emotions too. So, the sound insulation standards should be done professionally, making sure that it's lower than 40 decibels. "Look into your heart" Look into your heart? Is this your book? Yeah, I'm going to explain ghosts from a psychological point of view. Do you believe there are ghosts in this world? Have you ever heard of a suspicious ghost? If you believe in ghosts, ghosts exist. I thought you were a materialist. No contradiction. In fact, what our eyes see is far beyond what consciousness can handle. Psychologists have long known that people have a narrow attention span. Messages that go unnoticed shall then falls into the subconscious mind. In other words, what you see in your subconscious mind are things that you may not know. Some people dream at night, those were in your subconscious during the day will comes out then which may even form some strange combinations. So, it seems to me that the appearing of ghosts is something similar like that. It's all about the fear of the unknown. But there are people in this world who can see ghosts. Do you mean those with the Yin-Yang eye? Psychologists believe that the so-called yin-yang eye might just be schizophrenia or some other mental illness as hallucination or delusion. Because those people describe it so truly and in very specific, so the others believe in it. Other experts believe that the yin-yang eye is a disease of the eye. There's an eye disease called Bonnet syndrome which means a part of the retina loss its function and that part of the eyeball is hallucinating. Of course, you can reserve your opinion too. There you go, Zhi-cheng. You're bound to lose if you got to argue these with Yue-ying. I think Yue-ying's research can help a lot of people who are troubled by the ghost theory, it should help them with their psychological problems. Hey, is it a pipa? Yeah, can you play it? Yes, I have been learning it since I was very young. I don't know if it is related to the subconscious. Do you really know how to play? Just play for us, okay? Yeah, show us. Is that how you play it? I don't think so. I have checked on all these boxes they're just some old clothes of grandpa and grandma. Really? Let's open it and see. See? Let's see. I said it was just some old clothes. What is this? And old Guqin from long time ago. I don't know if I can still play it. And these, incense burner and essential oil. Don't read it all. I have checked on those, nothing wrong. Hey, here is a torn photograph. What is it? Never mind. What is that? Forget it! - Let's have a look. - None of your business! - What is it? - Let's go! Don't come back again. Zhi-cheng. Zhi-cheng, open the door. Calm down Open the door. What is going on? I told you about that before, I see a red ghost all the time. In fact, every time I see her. Something bad happens to people around me. I tried to tell myself that those are all illusions. But it's not. She really exists. I just saw her in the picture, she's a bride. Zhi-cheng, I wonder if you're wrong, could it be your delusion only? I wonder what she's got to do with my grandmother, but I'm sure that she knew my grandmother. My grandparents, my sister, her husband and Tan too, they all died because of me. My mom was right. I'm the one to be blamed. Woe betide three generations, whoever treats me well is going get killed by that ghost. No! Zhi-cheng, you are trapped in your own delusion now who just believe what you think only. Why don't we talk to Yue-ying? No. You promised me that you wouldn't tell anyone. Don't you believe me? I can't believe that! Zhi-cheng, I believe you! Listen to me, I'm a Christian. According to my faith, ghost are evil spirits who maybe a fallen angel, who take the form of a dead man to attach to others and puzzled people. But all they can do is to cheat, steal and destroy. The devil is the father of liars, it's just a fraud. Maybe there are just illusions that you've been building in your heart. Don't let it fool you! You can rest assured, I will always be there for you no matter what. Zhi-cheng, the world is a beautiful place which you should remember well. No matter what happens, you have to believe that the sky is always blue. Whether it is blue or green, they are the same sky. I'll pray for you... Sorry. Zhi-cheng, don't be afraid. I will always be with you. Si-tong, don't worry. I won't let anything bad happen to you. Looking to Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. For the joy that joy before him. I believe in communion of saints. I believe in forgiveness of sins. I believe in resurrection of the body. I believe in eternal life. Amen. I'm so hungry, are you ready to eat? Here's your love steak. Just steak? And chicken wingtips too. Steak with chicken wingtips? It's good match. This song sounds purple. Can songs also have colours. Yes, a lot of things have colour. Just like 26 English letters, A is red. I don't like the letter A, because I don't like red. I didn't realise you had such a vivid imagination. It's not imagination, they are real. It's like your name Si-tong, which stands for green. Because I like green. I'd like to know who the bride is. I guess she may be a bride waiting for her groom to return. Or who just had an unexpected wedding. I think she's a poor soul. It's not easy to live in this world, everyone has their own helplessness and pain. When having dinner on New Year's Eve, my father died of a heart attack suddenly. So, my mom had a hard time. She put 500 dollars on me, then left me outside the church door. At that time, I was 5 years old. Don't feel bad, Si-tong. I'm here for you. I don't know your mother, but I can feel your pain. Zhi-cheng, I forgave my mother. I understand that she has her own problems. Every human being has vulnerable moments. Although I don't know where she is right now, but I also hope that I'll see her in heaven someday. Try this. Thank you. Hello, Mr Chen. I'm in Hong Kong now. Investors will be in Hong Kong these days, we can talk about the cooperation plan in detail sometime. - Good. - Okay, bye. Miss Lau has come to Hong Kong. That's nice. So, you will run out of time but concentrate on your work now. I'll go see your mother with you tomorrow. We will show her that picture of your grandmother by the way, and see how she reacts. But don't you think it might upset her? I don't have a choice right now. Maybe I should go there alone, right? When my mom meets a stranger, her emotions can be volatile. Mom, do you remember? The piano and the picture are all my grandmother's. Who are they? Please told me. It is she... Who is that? It is she... Mom, who is that? She's following me! - Woe betide three generations. - What do you mean by that, Mom? Tell me, mom! Woe betide three generations! I must be the groom, right? "Diary" "Having birthmarks that related to the last life" "Seven storys about reincarnation" - Hello. - Hello, Zhi-cheng. I have an appointment with Miss Liu. - She said this solo show - You don't have to get back anymore. What? I said you don't have to come back, I'm going to fire you. What are you talking about? I'll pay you by the count. - What? - Just let it be. What's the matter? He said I was fired. Forgot to add value to the card again? Why are you following me? I said I didn't want to see you. I'm here to finish my last day of work, get to the exhibition with the irresponsible boss. You're fired. How can you fire me? Even if you're the boss, you have to give me a reason, too. Chen Zhi-cheng, You are really irresponsible. What have I been irresponsible for? You said you loved me, the one that saying never wants to see me again too. To North Point Waterfront Gallery, thank you. Do you want a ride or not? Let's go now, thank you very much. I think that's a good idea. But I want to ask that can we get all the press here? I prepare a gift for them, is that okay? I've got the press all lined up, and I have all the presents in place. So here you are, what do you guys think about the venue? It is fine for me. Hey, what do you think should be changed? Don't complain. I want to go over there and check it out. All right, let's go. I think this series of photos should better be placed over there. That one about the view would be better over there. What a coincidence, you know? That's what I thought too. I will go over there and arrange it now. Good. Yue-ying? What are you doing here? How's it going? How's it going? I worry about you, just come by to see what I can do. I really want to thank you. After all these, I feel that me and Zhi-cheng will get better and better. Come on, I'm on your side. I'll get to work, then. Xiang, turn on the light. - Is that okay? - Almost. No way, turn off the lights now. Let's raise the chandelier higher. Higher... I need you to follow up on this for me. Escape! Si-tong! Si-tong! - No, Si-tong! - Watch out! Let me go! - Calm down! - Get out of the way! Si-tong! Don't die... The ambulance is on its way, hang on. Zhi-cheng, I'm sorry. I can't be with you to the end. No, Si-tong! Come out! - Calm down! - Come out! Why would you want to kill her? Do you think killing Si-tong will make me love you? I won it. I can't love you. Zhi-cheng. Shall we talk for a minute? I'm sure that Si-tong wouldn't want to see you like this. You don't know anything, I'm the one who put her through everything. What are you talking about? Si-tong's death was accidental, it had nothing to do with you. It's a curse. I know that. I had expected. I didn't think I'd get away, but it has nothing to do with Si-tong. I told her to go. But she didn't. I'm the last person in the world who wants anything to happen to Si-tong. She actually killed her. It's my fault. It's all my fault. Who is she? - Do you believe... - Heard of a suspicious ghost? I thought you were a materialist. If you believe in ghosts, ghosts exist. But there are people in this world who can see ghosts. I've learned. Mom. I'm getting married. Are you happy? She wants to kill everyone I love. She wants me to stay with her forever. She also killed Si-tong. I am not afraid of her. I will not compromise. "Having birthmarks that related to the last life" "Seven storys about reincarnation" I need you to help me and my fiancee who died unexpectedly to finish the ghost wedding. Of course I'm at your service. However... You need understand the meaning of ghost marriage. Once you had the ghost weddings, you will then enter into a contract of marriage with your dead fiancee. You need to stick together and living together. Do you believe that? I believe that. No matter what happens in the future, Are you willing to take it on? I am willing to. "Supernatural folk customs communicating forum" "Ghost wedding should be outdated, right?" "Is there such a superstitious thing in modern days?" "Can anyone just base on a photo to judge about" "when and where that photo was being taken?" "Launch a topic" "It is the ghost, right?" "In my opinion," "ghosts are just the roundup of self-fears." "It is about an ghost wedding, so obviously." - Thank you. - You are welcome. Breathe in, and breathe in hard. In front of all celestial spirits and my family, I, Chen Zhi-cheng, shall take you Qi Si-tong to be my wife. From now on, to take joy and sorrow together. Whenever in health or sickness, both of you will support each other. To grow with you in love, and shall always be true to you. Until the regeneration. I must be the groom, that's why she went after me. It must be. You may kiss the bride. Congratulations. I was woken up by the smell and noise of breakfast. The breakfast today is in C major, I think it's fried eggs. While I was eating breakfast, I was reading the news on computer. Si-tong. I think the social page is a little spicy while the entertainment page has the smell of honey. From the first time I saw you... When I got back to school, I realised it was Monday. Monday is red. I already like the color of your name. And the name of the literature teacher is red. I hate red, I guess I'll just skip school today. I remember the smell of the wind that day. But, I ran in to her at the campus. She has a greeny name, called Si-tong. From the moment I saw you in college, I like you. The colour of your name. I liked the smell of the wind that day. Zhi-cheng, I really love you. I don't know what happened, but I'm ready to face anything with you. The pastor taught us to think of good things and say good things, then everything will going to be all right. When you told me about your past, I'm really happy. From now on, we are on the same path. You no need to be afraid, I will always be there for you. Please tell me, how can I meet her again? You'll see her. Take more of that oil I gave you and listen to that music. "The heart is happy while the face is blue" "The groom and the bride" "I bought a coffin and a ding" Essential oil is very hot. "The sky is vast" I don't like it. "And the blood is cold." "Live happily ever as destined" But I bore. "To defy natural laws" I'll wait for Si-tong to return. "I will help to nail it while you sleep in the coffin" You come back. I've been waiting for you a long time. Chen Zhi-cheng. Her body was being left in the morgue walkway. She was in a black wedding dress, even the burial objects were gone. So tell me, does it has anything to do with you? Tell me the truth, was it you who stole Si-tong's body? - Have you and her... - What? A ghost wedding with her is no help to you. Do you realise that this will only make your mental problems worse? I have no problems at all and don't call me a psychopath. So where have you been the last two days? What's got to do with you. How dare you said it was none of your business? How did you get Si-tong's ring? You can buy it on the street. Do you like it? Here you go. So what is it now? Is that enough asking? Do you understand? I'm asking you if you are done? Get off! I'll get back to you. Get out of the way. Why are you doing here? Enjoy, honey. I don't eat. Have your favourite chicken wings. I don't have to eat. Si-tong. Si-tong? Where have you been? So annoying. Si-tong! Honey. I bought you a bunch of flowers. I don't want to be a third party. Zhi-cheng, why are you sitting so far away? Are you afraid of me? No. I know it. You are afraid of her. Get a mage and get rid of her. That ghost is affecting my life, I wanted to get rid of her. Firstly, in the spirit of Taoist compassion, it's not necessary to exorcise evil spirits whenever they are seen. It is not always the best that the sooner getting rid of it. The so-called demons and ghosts, in fact are still living beings. A lot of them was once human beings. They could have been though something bad when they were alive that leads to their raw anger which made them into a spectre. If we can negotiate with them and try to resolve conflicts, then lead them by the good law in order to get back on the good path, that is also a boundless merit for you. But if you two really can't negotiate, we will bring them down with the Dharma only at this point. For exorcisms, we should try not to scare them out of their wits. We should be compassionate. What you mean is that... We shouldn't you have killed her? Don't be afraid. Heaven and earth infinite the way of nature. Capper coins from ancient times, a lot of people have touched it which can protect you somehow. It has been the bane of ghosts since ancient times. Take it with you. I am not scared. Taoism recognises the fairy world, but strictly enforce the concept of bounds. For all the transgressions, we are resolute in dealing with it. Demons and ghosts can exist, but only not to harass people. If any of them cross border, I will be brought to justice in my place as a Taoist. I'm not kidding. This is the Taoist way of life. Can you really hunt ghosts. Pledge of eternal love teacher way. I'm Li Gang the 43rd master of Heaven in Maoshan. Master, I'll go first. There are different feed signs, the yellow one can keep you safe. Mr Mage, take care. The abomination is too bad. Priest. What I've been through make me doesn't believe in god again, I hope you can understand. I don't understand, but I believe how you feel. I did something that I might lose the Lord's blessing. I'm with Si-tong now, but I felt that she was no longer herself. In our faith, We believe we can be with the people we love in heaven after death. That's what we want too. She had said the same thing before. But I don't believe you're with her now. I know you won't understand this. But what I was most afraid of... Si-tong told me to kill someone. Accurately, she asked me to kill a ghost. Is it possible that the Bible... From a biblical perspective, the Bible never denies the existence of ghosts. I was worried that it wasn't Si-tong at all. How about about this? Let's pray. The Lord Jesus Christ, Lord, thank you for letting Brother Chen Zhi-cheng come here. Lord, thanks you for your comfort. Maybe you are now facing something that I don't, but I'm not afraid. Because in my life, there is peace from the Lord. No one can take it away. I'm not going to look back. Because for me, it doesn't exist. - What do you mean. - Even if there is a ghost, I don't believe it exists. So for me, it just doesn't exist. I suggest you to see a doctor and get some professional advices, that might help you. Finally, willing to talk to me. She would not think so. She is very kind and have faith, how could she willing to kill someone? She's been feeling different lately, who is black now. She wasn't Si-tong. She wasn't Si-tong. I think that I am the reincarnation of that groom, that's why the lady in the red is always after me who even killed Si-tong. Zhi-cheng. Have you ever heard of psychological phenomenon of synesthesia? A psychological phenomenon in which the senses interact with each other. The stimulation of one sense will trigger another sensation. In psychology, it's psychological phenomenon of synesthesia. For example. What colour do you see for the letter A? Red. I hate red. In fact, you see red proves that you are not colour-blind. But you don't see black or white, all you see is red, the colour you hate. This is a symptom of synesthesia. The symptoms will come up from time to time, which is also out of your control. What's more, this disease is hereditary. It could be dominant, and maybe is on the X chromosome. It's because you're born with it, that's why you believe in it. In fact, I think ghosts are just imaginary, it is just a sustenance of fear. Whether people can see the so called ghosts, it has a lot to do with his five senses. I want to make a thorough physical examination for you, and see if I can help you. Add on a check up about the transponson yeast sequence. Okay. Jenny. From a psychiatric point of view, do you have some professional advice for me? I found that he is able to see and hear more than normal, who even have audiovisual synesthesia. His brain waves are much stronger than normal too. Based on the conversation I just had with him, I found out that at least three generations of his family have psychological phenomenon and audiovisual synesthesia Since they didn't know these scientific definitions, they think that they were seeing ghosts. He told me about a car accident that he had photographed, who metioned the sky that day was green. And in college, he doesn't like parties. So solitary. It was because whenever he heard someone laugh, he'll feel a sharp tingling sensation. Although, such cases are rare. But sometimes, the mind of someone may even be visualized in other's mind. Well, Sakyamuni just pass his thoughts on to someone else. So, just don't underestimate the power of brain waves. Doctor Zhao. Professor of the University of Washington are studing in Brain-computer Interfaces. That is to say. In future, you can control computers and machines with human brains. I've heard about it in the news. The study says that if the research can gets any deeper, humans can even affects one another with their own brain. Thank you for a long time, Jenny. Would you like to have a barbecue today? It's not raining. I have an appointment tonight, maybe next time? - I got to go, bye. - Bye. Zhi-cheng, this is the medicine Jenny gave you. They treat the symptoms, but inhibiting the neural response. To salve your psychological problems once and for all, we have to figure out the truth behind that photo that helps you really get out of the haze. I know that you won't believe me right now. But if there's a glimmer of hope, we're supposed to try, right? You don't want to be like this in the future, right? Ever since I first saw that lady in red, I've told myself. Since no one trusts me, I had to get her on camera. Wu Yue-ying. I cooperate with you. There it goes! All men will die. Woe betide three generations. Hello. Have you seen that lady in red in these two days? Not anymore. Thank you. Let me treat you to dinner. All right. Okay, bye. "Does anyone know that where is this photo came from?" "Please help me on the history of this photo" "Reply on Please help me on the history of this photo" "I know!" My dad used to tell me that this photo is about an unfinished ghost wedding 70 years ago. That groom is still alive. This is where he lives, you may go inside. - I won't go in there. - Thank you. There are my grandmother's things, we really want to know what happened back then. Me and my fiancee Xiao-hong... We were childhood sweethearts, our families are well-matched. But because of the war, she had to flee with her own family in order to escape from the war. We had a deal that we will get married once the war is over. When I get back from the army after the war, I was looking forward to get married with her. It is a pity that even I was able to be reunion with her... Xiao-hong! But Xiao-hong was being killed by the Japanese. I was so inconsolable that I sat by the body three days and nights. Do you really love Xiao-hong? Matchmaker and her 18-year-old heir held a ghost wedding for me and Xiao-hong. The ghost wedding ceremony is alike as marrying a living person. Here we go! But in fact, the details are totally different. Ghost weddings must be completed, or woe betide three generations. "The sky is vast and the blood is cold" "Live happily ever destined" Xiao-hong! "To defy natural laws" So the subconscious starts at the 18th birthday. No matchmaker will handle a severed weddings, therefore Xiao-hung and I can't finish our ghost wedding ceremony. After the accident, no one is willing to help. It has been seventy years. I've been waiting for you. Don't you get it? How could you possibly be the reincarnation if he is alive? The reason you see that lady in red so often is because of the subconscious inheritance. You're descended from that little matchmaker. There it goes! Woe betide three generations. In fact that my grandmother was that 18-year-old heir. This bottle of special essential oil should be special It helps to mollify the mood, which is conducive to hypnosis too. I've smelled it before. Very spicy. The old man thought only getting married to the girl Xiao-hong, they can be together forever. Zhi-cheng, he's been waiting for Sister Xiao-hong for 70 years. Since we are here, why don't we help him finish his ghost wedding? Just to fulfil his last wishes. Goodness. Let me! Slowly, watch out. Congratulations. That lady in red never showed up since then. How about Si-tong? I don't think I need this medicine anymore. I'll go find Zhi-cheng. How's it going? You really don't have to take medicine? Not anymore. Have confidence. Come out and say a few words, everyone is waiting for you. I've been through a lot, thank you for all your support and encouragement. I finally stuck with it, and our exhibition was also a complete success. Thank you all. Now, I have a decision to make. I decided to disband the studio. Thank you for your support along the way. You may not know about this. Since my sister and brother-in-law died, I decided to become a professional photographer. In fact, I was hoping to get a shot of that ghost in red in order to prove that I am not insane. But now, it turns out that lady in red don't exist at all. It was really just my imagination. Si-tong was right. The world is a beautiful place. The sky is always blue. The exhibition has been successfully closed, our wish had been fulfilled. This studio... It doesn't mean anything to me anymore. Boss, we get it. Cheers! - Great! - Cheers! - Bottoms up! - Come on! Cheers! - Who wants some honey? - I want it! See you later! It's all my fault. If it weren't for my conceit, Si-tong should be here with us now. Hey, that's enough for you. After I disband this place, I'm going to travel around the world alone and start it all over again. Why going alone? Did it ever occur to you that I was always there for you? Zhi-cheng. Zhi-cheng? Why can you see her? I'm sorry, Si-tong! No, Si-tong! You won't do this. Si-tong, I'm sorry. Even if you have to kill me, I'm sorry. Keep your mouth shut. I'm sorry! I won't be mad at you even if you try to kill me. I'm sorry! What did you say? I know how much you love Si-tong. When we were in college, I watched over you night and day. I told you not to talk to him, he has the evil. - It's not funny. - There he goes. I told you not to play with him. Hi, beauty. Let's go! Zhi-cheng, how could you be so careless? Yeah, thanks. Sometimes, I wonder that you might like me if it hadn't been for Si-tong. That day at the conference, I just called her two seconds late. I don't even know why I am two seconds late! I didn't expect that to happen as well! - I'm sorry! - Wu Yue-ying, do you realise that? Just because of this two seconds I lost the person I loved the most! I was the one who saved you in the water that day, not Si-tong! All these years, you only saw Si-tong. You have never ever looked at me. I was only two seconds late! I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - Does it help? Can your apologize bring her back? How could you do this to her! Get off! I didn't expect that to happen as well! I'm sorry! Listen to me, Si-tong. She didn't mean to hurt you. You know that I can feel it, right? Please forgive her. Si-tong, no! Listen, Si-tong. - You have a kind heart! - No! You won't kill anyone. "To Zhi-cheng" Listen to yourself! Zhi-cheng. I really love you. Every time when I listen to this recording, I dare not to. Because as soon as I hear, I will think of the good old days when I was with you. Listen to it, you have a very kind heart. But I have came across Yue-ying's diary unexpectedly, it turns out that she loves you so much as well. I am the third person in her eyes. But when she finds out I'm with you, she really feels happy for us. She is so generous and so kind. If I am not around one day, I want you two to fall in love and willing to be with each other. I will sincerely bless you. Si-tong, thank you. I see what you mean. That means the ones who believes in one thing so much, they are easy have synesthesia which can even affect the people round them as well. That's right. That's why ghosts that saw by chinese are different from what foreigners see. And ancient ghosts are also different from the modern's too. "The University of California" Congratulations on having a speech at the University of California. Congratulations to you too, you've finally recovered. I'm going to travel around the world with Si-tong. You will travel around the world with your inner Si-tong? That makes sense to me, only after all we've been through. You made a good decision. Just feel free to call me if you need anything. Goodbye. "Look into your heart" "By Wu Yue-ying" "Ghosts are the roundup of self-fears," "people's fear of the unknown" "which becoming a manifestation"
