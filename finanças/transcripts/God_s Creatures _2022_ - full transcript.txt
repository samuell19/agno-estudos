Long day ahead. Aileen? Thanks, love. More like donkeys broken in, Mary. Fuck's sake, like, we could have been anything. Teachers, nurses, hairdressers. Hairdressers? Don't be so ambitious, Sarah. Did you not just hear her calling us donkeys? Actual asses, like. But what an arse, Sheila, girl. My son! No! No! Mark! If I do nothing else, I'm teaching this little fecker how to swim. Erin. Jesus Christ, girl. Yera... for fuck's sake. They literally live on the water and none of them learn how. You know it's the tradition, Erin. What, it's bad luck to know? If they can't swim, they won't jump in and help anyone else. Pack of selfish wankers, too worried about their own skins. What's wrong, Oscar, love? Wakes up crying three, four times a night. - Disaster, like. - Jesus Christ, I remember nights with you. Could never sleep. Con telling me I just had to let you cry. How could I do that? Hearing every noise. You were the easier child, to be fair. How's it going? I haven't see you in a while. How's things? Good to see you. Hi, Dan. Brian O'Hara? What the hell are you doing here? Jesus Christ, the size of you. The stronger you get... Come here. We're all wider and wiser by the look Dan boy. - After a while. - Well boy, how's things? Brian. Christ, Brian... Mom, look at you, huh. Your hair. You haven't changed a bit. Who's this, huh? It's my baby brother, is it? What! No, no, no. Jesus Christ. Oh, come here to me. Oh. Well, Paddy, how's things? You son of a bitch. - Brian! - Erin! What the fuck! What are you doing here? It's 'bout time I came back, isn't it? - Sarah. - Brian. It takes Mark Fitz dying for you to come back to us, does it? What? That's who this is for? Ah, fuck me, it is. I'm so sorry. Just give me one second. Mary, um... I'm so sorry, Mary. - I'm so sorry. - Thank you. How long has Paddy been like this? A good few years now at this stage. - Must be weird being back. - Hmm. Probably the exact fuckin' same, though, is it? Does she ever stop going? Oh, not a second all the time you were gone. One minute, love. That dad, is it? You should go out and meet him. He'd like that. Go on. - You good? - Oh yeah, yeah. Strange seeing them shake hands. He's different, isn't he? Grown into himself. Do you reckon? A mother knows. The look on your face. - Don't be so shocked, mate. - What? - Has she fed you? - Uh, no. Not yet. Hard to believe he's home, huh? Good to be home now, all right. So, you're in Australia. Not been in touch with us in how long? And you get a notion, all of a sudden, to come home. Shit weather, fuck all work, and not tell anyone? Yeah. That's about the size of it, yeah. Come on, why are you back, like? Uh... Paddy's oysters. Christ. Oh, you be starting from nothing again. Have you money saved? Oysters take work. They aren't cheap. But we still have the license for it. I kept up the payments. Every year since Con gave up on it. Just in case. - Tilt it forward. - Okay. - Is it that way? - Yes. - That all right? - Yeah. I see you looked after it. My father wasn't able for it anymore, and you were gone and stayed gone. That was that. No other option. Didn't want to work it with anyone else. Jesus Christ, it's unreal. Ground's a bit soft in parts. You'll have to replace some of your trestles. Find a supplier for your oysters and bags. Start with seeds or half-growns, then. Be a year at least before they mature, turn profit. You'll have to find another income. But you know that yourself. That's nothing you can't manage, though, Brian. Is it? Not a bother. For fuck's sake. Oh, sorry, Aileen. Forgot to clock out. - Just give me a minute. - No rush, love. Fine looking oysters. Thanks, Francie. Be some craic if they caught us. Oh, don't say that to me. Hurry up will you. Come on. I'm waiting on you, Mom. - See you for dinner, yeah? - Go on, aye, go away. Be safe. Hup! Thank you, guys. Hi, boy, how're things? There you are. Here, take some of this. Go on. C'mon. Give us a song. - Go on. - Thanks, Mom. - There you go, Dan. - Okay, all right. I'll do one for you. What about Australia? - What was your favorite place down there? - Hmm. You'd be surprised how little I saw of it, Aileen. If I'd known where you were, I'd have gone and visited you. That would have been nice all right, but... you didn't miss much. Besides, it's the best thing in the world being back here... with you. - Where you off to? - Could I get another, Dan? - I'm going for a smoke. - No, no, no. You're not going anywhere. - We've gotta go home. - No. I don't want to go home. - I don't care. - I don't want to go home yet. Mary, huh? - No. - Come on. I'm telling you the count is low. Count them again. I counted them twice. There aren't enough bags. You telling me how to do my job, Francie? Someone's trying to cheat me. Is it going to come out of your fucking wages? Listen, I'm only giving you what you asked for. Oh, hold on. You're saying it has to do with me! - It's my fault now, is it? - Hey, hey, what's the story here, lads? This little bitch is trying to cheat me. Fuck off, Francie. There isn't near enough bags there. Where's the rest of my fuckin' half-growns? I'm sure they're all there. You filled them right, didn't you? Can't imagine how I couldn't have. I split them the exact same way as I did last time, like. Cause you're a moron, that's why. Is Dennis here? I haven't seen him yet, no. It's an easy mistake to make, girl. Go on away quick. It's crazy inside there, isn't it? Shame you and Francie had to go home early on us the other night. I've been taking space, and he's not been happy about it. Wiped my hands of him after the last night. But here I am crying my eyes out as if he's the one who broke my heart. Can't help it, though. Take your time with it. I've been back in my parents' house a couple of nights. Time puts it all into perspective very quickly. He was brutal with his words. Still, though, he's just like anyone else really. We're all God's creatures in the dark. That's four salmon. Two hundred to you. Good man. - Thanks. - Cheers. How's work going, Con? Ah, coining it, I suppose. Where's this come from? You think you're a hard man, do you? Fighting the system. Poaching alone, as if you didn't know better. It's nothing you didn't do back in the day, Con. I never went out on spring tides. Sure Mark died doing the same thing. And that's either what will happen to you eventually, or you'll be caught. All points to the same end, like. Stupidity. Jesus Christ, lighten up, mate. The bags she stole for you weren't enough, no? You lasted all of about how long making an honest go of the oysters? Longer than I reckoned anyway. Fair play to you. You keep telling me what I can and can't do, but I'm keeping Paddy's farm going. Your father's only trying to say that you don't have to take such a risk. Thanks for that, Mom. What's the story here, lad? Checking if there isn't anything I can make use of. Christ, things are that bad, are they? You're like a rat. Most of this is my old shite. It's long past being any use. Invest in a few new things for yourself. Give yourself a chance anyway, boy. Tell us, what... what are you doing tomorrow? Uh... head out in the evening after the tide, I'd say. So, you're free in the morning, I take it? Could have a job for you. I mean, use these away sure and I could pay you a bit extra on top. It's tough, isn't it... doin' it by yourself? It's too much, really, for one man. It's the lesson your father learned. These would fit Brian, would they? Are you all right, Mary? I keep thinking I hear Mark when I'm here alone. A sound at night... and it might be him moving around the place. Strange comfort. Thanks, love. Brian, come out the fuck. Can you hurry up? Oh. Oh. Got to keep an eye on the tide, mate. Some morning out there, Paddy Boy. Everything supposedly shifts, but... it's exactly like it was when you, me, and Con were workin' it. Drinking cold tea out of a 7UP bottle on a clear day, there's nothing like it. Are you there at all? Shit... Fuck... Dick, bollocks, arse. You didn't say anything? I didn't tell him nothing, no. Nine months later, this fella. He's a needy little fecker. The usual family traits. Boys being boys. Stuck to their mother's tit. Lookin' very smart. Do you want to come down with us? I should head home. We've an early one in the morning. Heading up the country for a few days. Show the small man there's more to the world. Come on. Let's go show you off. Oh. I... I don't know. - Christmas jumper. - Christmas jumper, that's the one. Okay, um... you could go anywhere in the world. No conditions. Where would you go? Do you know what... I'd rather just... reel the years back in... and sit you and your father down and make ye act like adults. It's nice imagining you getting along, living under the one roof. But I'm proud the way you are now, though. It's as if the work itself was the beginning and the end of it. Hey, Dan. - Hey, Sarah. - Can I get a whiskey, please? You can, of course. Yeah. Did you want another drink? No. No, stay there. I'll get it, all right. Let me get you this. Oh, you're grand. Thanks, though. You out for the night? We'll see now after this one. Mmm-hmm. I can't believe you're still here, to be honest. I thought you would have long abandoned this place. I don't know why you'd think that. Everything I ever needed was here. Didn't have to go looking for it. Hmm. Like what? Nah. We used to have a good craic together when we were younger, didn't we? - Us? - Mmm-hmm. It was so long ago. I wouldn't get hung up on it if I were you. What are you drinking? Go on sure, surprise me. I, um... two of the same again. - Uh, she's having whiskey, is she? - Mmm-hmm. There you go. There's... What time is low tide due? Go on, will you? All right. Night, pet. Good night. I might borrow that top off you one of the nights, Aileen. I'll see you tomorrow, girl. Sorry, lads. - Good morning. - Good morning. Were you out last night? No, no. I was not. Were you out? Good night so, was it? Mary, look. - Look at that. - Stop the belt. Aileen. - Fungus. - Shit. We've got fungus, too. Let me see that! Check the rest of the stock. Throw these ones out. Fuck's sake! What a disaster. Jesus! - Sarah? - Don't touch me. You are hereby warned to cease cultivation of all oyster holdings until further notice, punishable by loss of license if caught in breach of the moratorium. Any oysters you harvested today must be destroyed. Do you have any work for me? No, I'm not gonna need you again for a while, no. Keep your head down like the rest of 'em, you'll be grand. I'll take what you owe me, so. All right, lads, let's throw them all out. Yeah. - What are we supposed to do now, like? - Oh. Same thing happened, about seven or eight years ago, didn't it? Nearly destroyed the oyster farmers. The idea of them at home doing nothing. No good for anyone. It seems to be gotten worse and worse for her, doesn't it? Poor cratur. She didn't mean to bite at you. If Francie's done something, she needs to speak up about it. - Hey, love. - Hiya. Are you busy? Not a great time, no. I'm just doing a few jobs on the house. Mom says they haven't seen you in the factory in a few days. The smell's finally getting to you, is it? No. What's after happening, girl? I'm here, you know. If you need anything. Yeah? Yeah. I'll let you get back to it. Thanks. Hello? Aileen. Aileen. How are things? Hey, you might follow me through here now. We're just in here now, look. How's Con gettin' on? Where's Brian, Mike? Sorry to drag you all the way into town. You must be delighted to have Brian back in the house with you. Sure, you know yourself. Do you reckon? God knows if my girls moved back into the house, we'd be tearing strips off each other. Australia he was, was it? Australia, yeah. Isn't that always the way? Breaking his mother's heart. Exactly. Look, there's been a claim made about an assault in the village a couple of weeks back by a young woman who was in Dan Nell's pub on the night of the 18th of April. Brian says he was at home with you that night. Is that right? He was, yeah. - He didn't go out or anything at any stage... - No. No. And you'd say that again in court? I would. Yeah. All right. Look, I know, well, Brian's a hard-workin' fella. Is that it? I'll give him a shout for you there now. One minute. It's a bit much, Mike, isn't it, to drag me out in the middle of the night just to ask a simple question? We've to be seen to be doing our job, Aileen. Are you all right? Huh. Need to go for a few pints. My van is on the way back. We might pick it up. Was there anyone else out, do you remember? I couldn't tell you. What happened after I left you? We had a few drinks. Nothing we didn't do back in the day. What does that mean? Jesus Christ... Am I better off going back to fucking Australia? Is that it? Getting dragged into this shit. You're not going anywhere, all right? Do you hear me? Thanks, Mom. The moratorium won't last, is the point. In a couple of weeks, the water will cool, all will magically reset. Oyster farmers coining it again, like nothing ever happened. That's what time does. Lesson wasted on the young. Aileen? Aileen. Are there any extra hours I can pick up next week? You might cover Sarah's shifts. You haven't heard from her? I have. Yeah. We've had Guards into us. Yera, no... they were just looking to talk to customers who were in a few weeks back. It was a quiet night... That's what I told them. It'd be more in their line now to be looking into foreign trawlers raping our oceans, huh? Their hands are tied, that's what they'll tell you anyway. Why wasn't Jesus born in Australia? Oye. Ah, 'cause he was... Night, lads. - All right. - Yeah. Are you in with us tomorrow again, girl? I am, yeah. Thanks. - Night to you. - Night. Night. Because there was no wise men... No virgins either. - All right. - Hmm. Good man. Come on... - Night. - Night to you. Night. Is Brian in? A charge is gonna be brought against him. He needs to present himself in front of the district court today week, and an initial remand will be made in front of a judge. For fuck sake, Mike. Look, just make sure he's there, will you? You told them you weren't out that night. But we both know that's a lie, though. What do you know about it, Erin? There's Francie mistreating her for how many years, and nobody thinks anything of it. And suddenly everyone reckons that Brian's the problem. Who never put a hand on a woman in his life. You said yourself something was after happening to Sarah. Maybe it was Francie, yeah. But you don't want to hear her side? Are you all right? Sarah's not in again today? What time will you be back? I don't know. What happens if he's returned for trial? Come on. How does it finish? Hmm? There's nothing wrong with you, Paddy, mate. Hmm. You're only playing a trick on the rest of us. What other songs do you have? A verse of McAlpines? Hmm? A blast of The Wild Rover maybe? Good man. Hm. The complainant waited a week before making her report and claims she was followed down to the local pier on the night of the assault and that the defendant subsequently raped her down there. The defendant's mother has provided him with an alibi, Judge. And she reaffirms the statement that she and the defendant were in the house during the hours of the night in question, that the defendant remained in the house with her during the hours of the claimed assault? I do, Your Honor. Yes. Hmm. This is a serious accusation. It's also the first time the defendant has been before the court. Now it's my opinion that there's not enough... in the Book of Evidence for the State to prosecute. Charges will be remanded back to the DPP for further instructions. I also believe that this charge should not have been brought before the court. Uh, the defendant is free to leave. What's next? File 15, Judge. Drunk and disorderly. Aileen. Come here a minute, will you? What's her attendance lately? Fourteen of 16 shifts missed. I can make the days up. Please. Has anyone else missed a shift in the same time? You could have let us know at least, you know, called in sick. But I have to let you go, girl. You're right, Dennis. I should've let you know what's been happening with me. That was the mistake, yeah? It's all very convenient for you, though, isn't it? Between Francie's oyster bags and everything else, everyone's got their fucking eyes closed. Wait, hang on a second. Sarah? What about the oyster bags, Sarah? Come on lads, focus, back on the work. What does she mean about Francie's oysters, Aileen? Go home. - What? - Go home for the day. Oscar, love. You can't just take him out of daycare without telling me. He's not your son. I don't want you looking after him anymore. Fuck's sake, Erin. She's still his grandmother. If you'd actually sit with her, you wouldn't be able to deny what happened so easily, Aileen. - Go easy on her. - No. For fuck's sake, she needs to hear it. I'll talk to her. You have to be careful with him. And all the time that Sarah was in here, when it was Erin's room. I used to joke with her mother about the two of you, that we'd be in-laws. Was she lying about the oyster bags, Aileen? I'm gonna have to put you on the line until I figure out what the story is. Moratorium's been lifted. Be a mad few weeks. Might have to hire a few more hands. So the story went round, and for months, people thought the wife died 'cause she'd fallen down the well tryin' to save the turkey. It was some clever prick, the guard. It'd be great to have you all over next Sunday after mass. Give you a rest for once. Be a break for you. As if he'd been waiting for that question the entire time. 1: I'll do my apple crumble. "Because she was an annoying bitch, that's why." Two gins and a tonic, please? Not tonight, no. What? We retain the right to refuse service here, love. Do yourself a favor and go quietly. Hmm? You can all go to fuckin' hell. You stay where you are now, lad. Hold on to him there, boys. Don't you go following her now, eh? I hate these traditional things. Showing face just for the sake of it. I might not bother going. Do what you want. It's a late tide today. Aileen. Aileen, would you come in here? I'll, uh... ...Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee... - Sorry for your loss. - Thank you. - Sorry for your loss. - Thank you. Thank you. I'm so sorry for your loss. Thank you. I'm so sorry for your loss. - I'm sorry for your loss. - Thanks. - Sorry for your loss. - Thank you. I'm sorry for your loss, Con. Thanks, Sarah. - Sarah! - Don't fuckin' touch her. - Condolences for your loss, Brian. - Thanks. Seems like the whole world has turned upside down. It's just as fucked as it's ever been, Mom. It might look different if you're the one turning. But... nothing's changed. Trust me. You were right stepping in like that, though. We're going to head home. Get some rest. You should, too. Huh? What do you want? Um, whiskey, I guess. - You want whiskey? - Yeah. Here, two whiskeys, please. Two whiskeys, huh? - Yeah. - You look great. - Thanks. - How're ye, lads? - Do you like whiskey, you do? - Hmm. Oh, yeah? - That one's for you. - Thanks. Brian? - Aileen, you know Emma, you do? - Hi. You're better off going home, girl. He's a bit old for you. What are you doing? In what world did you ever think that this would be appropriate? What're you talking about? For fuck's sake, who do you think I am at all, Mom? Hey, hey. Don't put your hands on your mother. - Con, what the... Con! - You're a fucking disgrace. Get off me! Get off! If you're here to shout, don't fuckin' bother. I'm going out. Imagine what it'll be like out here in a year? This is the investment round us, like. Do you not feel anything about what's happened, no? About Sarah... about what you did to her? Don't look at me like that, will you? Does it mean absolutely nothing to you? Is there no heart or feeling in you? Jesus Christ! You have this impossible image of me, Aileen. Let's just move forward, all right? I want you out of our lives. Mom! Mom! Mom! Sarah, love, can I step in? I'm ashamed, girl. Sitting in your house. I'm sorry to be bothering you, I... I don't know why I had to. I... I'm not explaining myself. You shouldn't be leaving. The wind the past few weeks... These houses are so fuckin' bad for it. I suppose that's what Mary was hearing. Sound of Mark in all the rooms. Just the wind getting through. The way I used to listen to my mother at nights, carrying Dad down to bed when he'd be pissed. Hearing her moving around the rest of the night then, crying away to herself. Me just lying there in my own room. Twenty years ago, and I can still hear their echo. I suppose every house around here has the same ghosts. Mom was so proud of the fact that she was able to leave me this house. I'd live here after she did, and so on... until the tide takes it. All the times I used to wake up in your house, Aileen... Brian in the bed beside me. That same wind keeping me awake every night. Is it the sound of him that's haunting me... with all these other ghosts? The thunder of pasts getting in. Because all of a sudden, I... I don't know where I am. As if this house and all its history wasn't mine.
