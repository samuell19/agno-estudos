Look, baby! Ocean. Ah, ocean. Oh, man. Teach me how to surf, mommy! We're not gonna be there that long. How'ya do? Here you go, man. God bless. Good luck. Have a good one. - Have a great day. - You too. Happy new year! Oh, Malibu. Nice place to be homeless. Look at these houses. This is crazy. Oh, man. How did she score a place here? This is it. You ready? - Mr. Bannett. - Hi. Hi. You're so lucky, you know the fire was contained, so there's no structural damage. It's got great bones. And of course, you can't beat the location. I know a couple of developers who would jump all over this. Oh, thank you, but uh, we're actually gonna do the work ourselves. Oh. Well, we need to clear the brush. Yeah, let's just uh, let's just worry about the inside. Okay, well, best of luck. - Thank you. - Thank you. Uh, quick question, what... Okay. Okay, here we go. God, it was never this bad. Honey, don't. When you said we could live on site, you didn't mention the smell. This may be the best thing my mother ever gifted me. That is a $6-million-view. But what's the land worth? Oh my God. Oh my God. Ugh. We just stick to the plan, okay? No more flipping row-houses. We build our dream home, we have kids, we retire. But what if we can't sell it right away? Really? I'm sorry, have you... have you met that view? Again with the view. Is that all you got? Mom, I'm home. Hey. Should have tried harder. Babe, don't. Even if you'd found her the right facility, she wouldn't have gone. I know it's hard, honey. When my mom died, I cried in the shower for a year. I love you so much. I love you, too. Hey, Gary. Come here, baby. I'm sorry, Gary, your mom's a loser. Oh, you're my baby. Hey! I'm Joan, if you need anything, just let me know. Okay, thank you. I just got these in. Hand-blown. My customers rave about them. From south of the border. What do you think? Oh yeah, that works. - Okay. - Okay. I'll take two of these please. Well, thank you, my wife's gonna love 'em. Yeah, yeah. Alright, stick it in. Oh, right. And I need to see your I.D. Right, yeah of course, sorry. Here you go. So you're the guy that just moved into the house on Paradise Cove? I'm the guy. Have you met Bree yet? Uh, Bree who? You know what, take another bottle of this on the house. Really? Welcome to the neighbourhood. Thank you. Honey? What the hell? They're beautiful, but... You're welcome. You were gonna get lucky any way. You really didn't have to. Okay, well, I'll just take 'em back. I'll send 'em back to Turkey. - You need more. - No, no, I'm good. Oh, come on, keep going. No one likes a quitter. - Alright. - Move. I'll give you just... just enough to match me. Alright, that's good. - That's good. - How about... That's good. You don't have to do anything. Mmm. No more for the night. Mmm. Hear that? It's like living on a boat. Yeah. Hello. - Hi. - Hi. More eggs than a hen house. Yeah, more targets. - Hmm. - Mhmm. Wanna hit my target? I do. Can't beat this view. Well, listen um, you can always put up "No Trespassing" signs. Does that work? Uh, it depends on who you are. Look, normally with the homeless, half of them are on drugs, and the other half are out of their minds. The city does nothing. They wanna give them access. Got nowhere else to put them. But Bree is different. Yeah, she's lived here a long time. Well, we live here now. Yeah, and we're about to do a major renovation. Yeah, well, you are always free to uh, clean up your own property. Night, folks. Excuse me. - Thank you. - Yeah, thanks. - Watch your head. - Yep. Oh boy, good luck. Honey, what are you doing? Well, I'm cleaning up our own property. Alright. It's not too much stuff to remove. What the hell? Who took my stuff? Criminals! Shit! That must be the lady. What? Well, I don't wanna go down there. Oh. Go deal with her please. I can't. Alright, alright. Babe. Hey. So uh, this is a... a private beach. I know. I got married on this beach. Supposed to be access points all along here, but beach hoarders don't like to share the sand. So they go out of their way lock entrances and post signs just to keep trespassers off the beach. Ever since the railroad barons stole it from the Chumash, Malibu's been trying to keep out interlopers. But if history teaches us nothing, you can't... You can't... you can't own nature's bounty. Ocean eats away at everything. I'm only 22 years old. Look, just so you know, there's gonna be a lot of people working here. Ah, the hubris of building on the temporary. Rising sea levels, erosion, wild fires. Even the hills could come down on you at any moment. And where does the pigeon decide to build his nest? But it's the fragility that makes it valuable. And you wanna build your identity around owning this fragile thing, but your identity is the most fragile thing that you own. You just... you can't live in a construction zone. Aren't you staying? Yeah, but the point is it's just... it's not safe. Hmm, now you sound like your mother, Knox. You know, it's funny, Patricia never mentioned having a son. How was she, in the end? Desperate, isolated, lonely. It was sad that she never got the help she needed. Suffering alone like that. Look, I don't know what happened between you two, but it's mine now. I have the deed. You have the deed, Knox. You got yourself a piece of paper! But did you think about who had to fail for you to succeed? Or is that just the Bannett family way? Uh, you... you probably have some family. Do you have family around here? Yeah. My son, Roman. Great. How about I call him? Can I call him? Oh. Oh hey, please don't, don't... okay. Hey, hey, you're okay, you're okay. You're okay. Just... I'm sorry. It's just... it's been a while, I'm not used to... Listen, I'm just trying to help. Could you get me a glass of filtered water from the house? My mug is over there. Uh, yeah. Sure. Mmm. Hmm. There you go. Oh, hmm. You know, there are a uh, ton of shelters around. With this view? Um, yeah, here. What's this? That... that is for you, to find a new place to live. So we're good? No. We're wonderful! Okay. Hey, Knox... I could taste the hose. Okay. Yeah, thank you. Another developer? Kids on your hand, can't eat lunch. Inspector. Hey, what you got for me? Treasure map? Always. Alright, 26270 Paradise Cove. - It's a special property. - Comes with something extra. Mhmm, mhmm. Private beach. Alright, let's see. We got a one bedroom, one bath here. Uh no, it's actually a... a two bedroom, two bath. Not according to zoning. You gotta convert it back to get a permit. What? No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, we... we can't do... Uh, can't you guys look the other way? Or... All you flippers say that. Look, it's my mom's house, okay? I'm gonna be in and out. Look, if it's liveable, you might wanna think on it. How's the surf, Griff? Fsss. Alright, give me 10, bro. Yes, sir. Have a good day. Come on! Fuck! How can I get $6 million out of a one bedroom house? You can't. Personally, I'd unload it. Griff, come on. You gotta help me out here. Nah man, I don't like doing un-permitted work, dude. Fine. How do you feel about cash? I feel like your house will be done in six weeks. - Alright. - Alright. Don't get wet, we're leaving soon. That's a good boy. Oh, sweetie, I think this is her. Hey! You're our new neighbour! Hi! - I'm Tracey. - Pam. This is my husband Mike. Hey there. It's so nice to have a young couple move in. When we first got here, 3 million years ago, this street was all full-time residents. Now they're second homes. Wow. Where are you from? Uh, Detroit. Oh, that's funny. The last owner was from Michigan. Total nightmare. When do you think you'll be finished? Babies can hear sounds in the womb. Is it your first? Fifth. - Wow. - I know. He doesn't even need to be in the same room. You must have started it early. Not really. She's 32. It's time to replace me. You got any kids? Uh, no. Oh, that's too bad, they're really fun. See you around, Tracey. Nice to meet you. What are you doing? You don't wanna skimp on finishes. It is Malibu. Where'd you go to design school? Ah, here it is. Cararra marble. Yeah. My husband will be back any minute. Right. When you're rich, you're eccentric. When you're poor, you're just plain crazy. Will you give me my dog! You know, bad luck is not bad character. I'm a good person, once you get to know me. Not like your grifter mother-in-law. Excuse me? What, you never asked Knox how mommy scored a beach house in Malibu? Connect the dots, Tracey. Patricia moved in, stopped paying rent, while she was secretly paying my property taxes. That's right... I didn't know I lost my own house until your squatter-in-law showed up with the goddamn deed. Oh, should I lock up? I wanna call the sheriff again. No, honey, the sheriff can't come here. Why not? Because we're not doing this permitted. Are you kidding me? Good luck with that. Knox, she's squatting under her own house. You never asked your mother how she got it? I thought it'd be different this time. This time. Oh, I get it. This is what she did. How she raised you. I was a kid, I didn't know any better. 30-fucking-9, Knox! And I'm your wife. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't want you to think I was like her. No, you're not like her, Knox. You're worse. I'm taking the truck. Can uh... Yeah, here we go, yeah. Are you guys still having lunch? We gotta finish that framing. What's that? Let me see that. Did you find that under there? Under there... uh yeah. Alright, I'll take care of it. What can I get you, Bree? Oh, hi. Uh, 3 pounds of the sirloin please. Nice. We just love grass-fed beef. So good with just butter and salt. No fussy bordelaise sauce to junk it up, you know? Always the best. Thank you. Have a good one. Not again! Hi, honey. Hi. Did you give her money? Yeah, so she could find a place to live. Well, she spent it on $50 steaks! What are you spying on her? I was shopping for groceries. And are you seriously taking her side? No, I'm not taking her side, but honey, have a little compassion. Why? 'Cause she looks like that? What? Oh, come on! You haven't noticed that underneath all that, she's fucking hot? Honey, she's a middle-aged homeless woman, living under our house and she will leave, trust me. Gary! Dog rules. - Can't leave any holes. - Okay. No huecos. - No problema. - No... no problema. Pardon. Hey, we... we can't let Gary out. If he's not in his crate... He's on his leash. - Okay. - Okay. Alright Nick, hey, vamanos. Let's go, let's pack it up. Guys, thank you. No problema, huh. Hey, hey, where do you think you're going? I'm ovulating. - Oh, oh, say no more. - Okay. Joan, I come in peace! Are you here? Bree... No trespassing. Oh my God. Bree, what are you... what are you doing here? Oh my God, there's a bug. Are you... are you living here? What are you doing? You have to pull yourself together, Bree. You're broken. You wanna fix something, fix your car. Okay, okay. Bree... Bree, everybody is trying to help you. Everybody. Look, I... I will... I... I... I'll put you... I will get you a 72-hour psych hold. Maybe you can talk to somebody, but I can't do anything if you're not gonna help yourself, Bree. You gotta help yourself, do you understand me? Okay. - That'll work. - Yeah? Oh yeah. Come here. Do you smell that? Yeah. Babe, she could burn down the house. Alright, I'll go down. Oh. Babe. I'll deal with it, I got it, I got it. Oh my God. Pretending not to see me like that rude wife of yours? She fits in perfectly with those fish-lipped trophy wives hooked on chardonnay and antidepressants. Print keeps getting smaller. You like my remodel? Budget was a little tight. Yeah, well, it uh, wasn't meant for that. You thought you could bribe me to go? Check a fucking sales record. There's a reason why beach houses stay in families for generations. Okay, look, you can't smoke under the house. Your mother got me hooked on Menthols. Nasty habit. But I never quit anything once I start. Yeah, well, my mother died smoking, so... Yeah. It really is dangerous. Tracey's right. I could burn the house down. But you're not really worried about fire. You still haven't cleared the brush. No people food, Gary. What were you doing down there, asking her to prom? I was weeding. Oh yeah, night weeding. - Is that a thing? - Yeah, it's a thing. Seriously, Knox, she's not your friend. She's not your mother. I know that. But I think I can make her go away. Well, good. 'Cause if you can't get me pregnant, the least you can do is get her the hell out of here! Well, maybe I'll just do both. God. Hmm, twice in a day, that's my hunky monkey! That's right. Wait, wait, Knox! What? I think Bree's in here. What? I think she's in here. I'll go check. Just stay here. Door's locked. Are you sure? Am I sure? Yeah, hello, hormones. I'm not paranoid. There's a crazy lady living underneath the house. Well... Well? There's a very handsome man living in your house, so. Yeah, there is. Okay. Don't worry. Gary! Oh. I love you. I love you... oh, you were talking to the dog, I thought you meant me. Honey? Hey, hey, it's okay. I'm sorry. I'm just so afraid of getting my hopes up again. Come here, it's okay. Woah, woah, woah, woah. Guys, guys, guys, guys, what are you doing? I just... I just put that up! You wanna tip off the city? Fine, fuck it. Listen, if you fence her out, she'll just dig in even deeper. See there's crazy, there's Malibu crazy, then there's Bree. You know, Bree used to be even hotter. Yeah, back in the day, I remember when we put in that deck, she came to watch, Hiron almost cut his hand off. Wait a minute, you've worked on this house before? I've worked on every house before. Hey uh, you need a ride to the bank? Uh yeah, let me just grab my phone. Oh, cool. Ready. Aw, hello baby. Hi, cutie. I don't know if I could work with my husband, but we do love watching those home design shows. Seems like so much fun. Mhmm, it's mostly stress. Any way you can reduce that stress? We're in the middle of a renovation. Okay. Hey, getting pregnant during a remodel is hard, but staying pregnant is even harder. Here, scooch down a little bit. Oh my. What's going on here? Let's go. Pssh, wait. Hmm-hmm, you're home. Trace, oh. Guess again. You can't make this go away. Woah! Stop right there! You're dripping all over the floor. Still no sign of social services. I called all of the shelters. The closest one is downtown L.A. So woohoo, we're on a waiting list to get a fucking crazy lady out from under a house we can't sell. Honey, I think the shots are making you a little emotional. Fuck you, Knox. You didn't even ask how the new doctor was. - Oh, that's right. - Yeah. I for... I'm sorry, yeah. How did it uh... how did it go? I didn't make one single egg. I made 20. - What? - Yeah. Turns out I'm a pretty good egg farmer. Are you proud? Honey, yes, I am. I love it. So 20 eggs that means 20 babies, huh? - Hmm. - I like it. It's... it's a lot. Alright, I'm gonna get dressed. Tragedy strikes in Malibu. Movie producer, Steven Lehvey and his 9-year-old son were killed after their car plunged 200 feet off Malibu Canyon Road. The boy is survived by his mother, Lehvey's ex-wife, Bree. Yeah, that's gotta be why she snapped. It's horrible. But it doesn't change anything. We're not gonna just give her her house back. Gary, dinner! He's probably stuck in a crate. Gary! Did you remember to close the door? Hey, uh! Uh! Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary! Gary! Come here, boy! Gary! He didn't have dinner. Honey, we'll do a full sweep in the morning. Okay? He's gonna show up, I promise. Knox! Honey, you forgot your phone. What? No. No. Dammit, Knox! Did you even look? Honey, I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. How can I trust you with our child? I'm gonna be a bad father, because I ran over a dog? He was my baby! What are you doing? Honey, we need to bury him. No! I want him with me. It's not our house. We have to cremate him. Honey, I loved Gary, too. But we can't spend 300 bucks on a dog funeral. Yeah, let's see if the economy by how well these people are doing. I can't believe he threw this in the trash, lucky you were there. No problem. Man, I miss war. Yeah, me too. It's like what you ladies must feel in childbirth. Having the power of life and death. Yeah, that and wasting people. Well, what doesn't kill you makes you dead inside. Yeah. Alright, that's it, everybody out now! This is private property. Yeah, she's got rights. Hey, Mr. Five Dollar! Saw you at the hardware store. You see me? Everyone deserves to be seen. You want us to go home, buddy? Yeah, I do, get outta here. We ain't got no home, buddy. And we were just having fun. I could do this all night. No, I don't know. You about ready to leave, Rodney? I'd rather be water-boarded. Okay, easy, my brother. There you go. Family. Comprende, amigo? Family. Alright, let's pack it up, boys. Vamonos. Anything for our queen. And free steak. Thank you. Bye, lover boy. Don't be rude to the guests, Papa Pigeon. They're not my guests. These boys are true friends. You can't count on anyone in this town. They're all crazy. Fucking Malibu crazy. Like that lying whore, Joan. Some friend she turned out to be, stealing my husband. Why are you still here? Hmm? Because I belong here. You never will. Tell me something, Bree. What's the wife of a big Hollywood producer doing living under a house? Hmm? For what, ghosts? Your son and husband are dead. Face it, Bree, you're all alone here. And I thought you cared about me, Knox. Maybe you only like me in the shower? Oh, hey man, what's up? I was just about to head to the bank. Uh, wrong direction. Hey, I need the last quarter, up front. Yeah, well, I thought we'd be further along. Well, there is the squatter factor. I can pay you, but you gotta help me out, man. Come on. I can't have you hijacking my construction. Now you fuck with me and I fuck with you, Mrs. Lehvey. Are we clear? Are you high? My client is not happy. Well, I wasn't happy with you either, Griff. What are you gonna do? Call the city on me? They'll send out an inspector out here tout suite! By the way, that's French for, "you're fucked". Fuck! 15 grand. We need Cararra countertops, it's Malibu. We just shelled out 6 grand for your fancy new picture window. And we have other expenses, babe. Like my massive medical bills? Sorry, I'm such a failure and destined to be a drunk like both my parents. You're not a failure. Oh, just a drunk? Thanks. Look, we either pay for fertility or finish the construction, what do you wanna do? Who cares? We both know it's never gonna happen anyway. We just can't afford to have anything else go wrong. Motion lights. No. Fucking. Way! He shouldn't have been there, the tide was pushing in. Yeah, is that what we're calling her now? We just need to finish this thing and get the hell out. Really, Knox? You think she'll just let us finish? Your mom couldn't get rid of Bree. You think you can? What will it take for you to get half as pissed as me? Don't say estrogen! 'Cause crazy can't win! Yeah, hi mom. I'm so excited, I'll call you from inside, so you can hear the heartbeat. I know! Crazy fast, right? Happened first try. And I thought we'd be out all this money. I'm gonna be a mommy. Mrs. Bannett. Okay, so I wanna lower the dosage next round. - Okay. - Okay? The hormones triggered early ovulation. Um, what does that mean? I'm afraid we can't do in vitro. The cycle. Well, we... we can't afford to lose another month. Is there something that we can do? Doctor said only chance is doing it the old-fashioned way. What? Babe, the workers are here. I'm in this with you now, so you better give me a baby. Let's go. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sorry, it's your baby-making shirt. I need a jumpstart. Careful, this... you got this? Lo tengo, lo tengo. - Despacio! - Okay. Knox? Where are you? I'm here. No, you're not. No, I'm right here. I'm right here. Ow! Oh my God! Ah. Wha... Hey. There's nothing sadder than a woman who can't fulfill her basic biological function. Oh no, trust me, I know the whole science route, the pee sticks, the blood work. Then you stop having sex and that doesn't help. Makes even a good man stray. Oh, have you tried the tea? It works. It's how I got my Roman. Mm, never mind. Even a baby can't save your marriage at this point. Fuck you, Bree. What? Knox is right. The drugs are making you emotional, Tracey. Stay the hell away from us! Happy Valentine's Day! Mmm. I'm so glad I made this for you. Did you write the check to Dr. Baum? What do you think? Honey, please. Don't tease me. You know, I'm super sensitive right now. Of course, I did. Come on. That's the point of this whole thing, it's for us. Are we okay? You know, I've been moving around my whole life. In between evictions and mom getting help. And not getting help. All that noise and the moving, the chaos... ...it was like living under construction. I didn't even know it wasn't normal. But now I see it. The quiet. Because no matter how loud it gets or where we're living, I know where my home is. It's with you. Get the fork out of here. I mean it, Tracey. I'm lucky to have you. And so was Gary. Mmm. He taught us how to be parents. Yeah, he did. And now we're ready to mess up our very own human baby. I've been up and down and pushing you away. You've been so patient with me and hung in there. And you were right, what you said before, it is the hormones. And I am so sorry. Hey, have I told you my construction joke? No. Hold on, it's not done yet. That's a good one. I can't wait to see our new window. I know, me too. Hey, let's see it from the beach. Yeah. Alright, let's see this thing. - Wow. - Mhmm. And you doubted me. I know. What was I thinking? I don't know. Why you doubted me. - I love you. - I love you. - You okay? - Oh my God Yeah. Yeah, see she's right there. Alright, get out. - Did you enjoy the breeze? - That's it. Get... get her the hell outta here! Step back, please. Mrs. Lehvey, whenever you're ready. Accidents happen in construction. We're not playing in a wheat field in Tulsa. The danger is real! What? You think you're gonna be young, and beautiful, and just live forever? Hey! Where's my phone call! What if she gets out? No, the sheriff said she wouldn't see a judge for 72 hours. God, she's like a boomerang. You throw her out, she comes right back. Nice security system. Honey, I promise, I won't let anything happen to you. Thank you, babe. Don't worry. Okay. Alright, Bree, let's go. You made bail. Come on, let's move. Come on. Coming! Ugh! Thank you for coming. Yeah, do you wanna show me where she's been living? Well, right down here. Sorry for the delay. There's only 58,000 homeless people in L.A. County. Hmm, that's more people than my hometown. Mhmm. Well, you are right. These are not safe living conditions. I hope you can relocate her. Yeah, I'm not animal control. She's not a raccoon, she's a person. But I was able to pull a few strings and get her a bed downtown. That's amazing. You know what, I can just take her right now. Now? Yeah, you said it was an emergency. Where is she? Um, she's... she's in jail. So what you're saying is I can't take her because she's not here? And I drove an hour and a half on PCH. Peace out. Hold up, Knox. Griff, can we do this later? No, no, no, we ain't doin' this later. I need my 10K today. Come on, man, get off my back, will ya? See. See, this is why I don't do un-permitted work. 'Cause see people like you try and take advantage of me, right? Listen dickhead, I put my ass on the line for you. I got my best worker out, I got A-listers who pay waitin' on me. Now if... If you ain't square with me by the end of the day, then we're moving on. And ain't nobody around here gonna touch you or your goddamn shit shack! 8, 9, 10 to make 10,000. Great. Thank you. Um, do you have an envelope? Uh, will you be making a deposit today? Uh, no. Can I check my balance though? Of course. Sorry, thank you. Thank you, I'm sorry. Next. Social services finally came. Perfect timing. And that wasn't the worst part of my day. Honey, come on, you can't trust a cheap box test. They're 99% accurate. Well, the doctor is just trying to drag this out, so he can make more money. It's not her fault I'm barren. Okay, this is the part where you tell me that I'm not. Knox, are you even listening to me? No, no, no, no, no, no. It was just here. What are you looking for? An envelope from the bank. Yummy fertility tea. You want some? Me neither. He's got his crew running around here, unsupervised. Did you check the bedroom? Why do you have this? What's that smell? Oh my God. Call 911! Shit! Where's my phone? Hey, hey! You can't be burning things out here. What are you... Oh no, no, no, no, no, no! Ow! Oh no, no, no, no. Enjoy the barbecue. Where's the money, man? It's gone. - She burned it, man. - Oh, come on. Come on! What is this? Griff's final payment. What are you saying? I'm saying she's down there, burning our money. Well, how'd she get out? I don't know! Are you fucking kidding me? Mom, it's the flippers. You can't grill on the beach, it's illegal. Good evening, Mrs. Mahoaney. Sheriff Garcia. Sorry to bother you. Have you seen your old neighbour, Bree Lehvey? That was my money you torched. I can't get blood from a fucking stone. You think I won't tell the cops that you put Paco in a fucking coma? I should kill your fucking ass. Well, just be aware that uh, she could be dangerous. Could be? She broke into our house, almost burned it down, and stole all of our money! Can't you people leave that woman alone? And don't make us bail her out again. The parking in the valley is terrible. Come on, sweetie. Oh my. Hmm. I can't... This is unbelievable. That went well. But you're Bree. Ah! Let me get this straight, you accused her of shattering a window. Now you claim she stole from you. There's no proof of any of this. I realize Mrs. Lehvey is an inconvenience, but she is still a citizen who will be here long after you two leave. Now if you'll excuse me, I have real bad guys to catch. Yeah. Where's Griff? Hiron, what? What is it? It's Friday. Pay day. Okay, excuse me. Nice, one step closer to getting out of here. Alright, Griff. Afternoon. Excuse me, coming through. Oh. Received a call from one of your neighbours. The Mahoaneys? Bree Lehvey. Shall we? Wha... - Lot of nice work here. - Thanks. Yeah, just uh, you know simple stuff. Found it! Really? Guys, that second bedroom was here when we got the house. - Yeah? - Come on. I uh... I'm sure the city has bigger fish to fry. Alright, look, Inspector, just tell me. How much is it gonna take for you guys to forget about this? Um, do I like my career, Bill? No. You love your career. I didn't graduate the best online community college in Bakersfield for nothing. Where's your contractor? He walked off the job. Yeah, well, Griff finishes, if he gets paid. Guys, come on, we're gonna be outta here in two weeks. Perfect. You got two weeks to tear all this out, put in a proper one bedroom/one bath. Mhmm. Let's go. You put this doorknob here, that's on rust. Thanks. Hmm. Oh my... oh. Oh my God, Knox. Oh my God. Tracey! Oh my God. Honey, are you okay? Okay, okay, okay. I got you, I got you. Honey, we're gonna get through this. You're lucky you came in right away. I'm so sorry about the baby. Baby? What? No. No. I assumed you'd taken a home test. I did. You were only a few weeks along. What? I am so sorry. I should leave you two alone. God. Okay, okay. It's okay. Honey, it's okay. Do you know what this means? We have to start all over again. No, no. It means you can get pregnant. How? God, in a... in a construction zone with a crazy lady and no money to do IVF, because you gambled our future away on a stolen beach house? That's a recipe for quality embryos. I am sorry. It's okay. Maybe we dodged a bullet. With your family history. Wow. You can go now, I'm tired. Hello, Papa Pigeon. I know Tracey is sad, because she didn't see two lines on a stick. But having a child is a huge responsibility. Like owning a beach house. You don't deserve either. You think you're special? A miscarriage is nothing compared to the pain of losing a real child. You should thank me for what I did. You messed up. You put a house before family. Now it's your turn in the barrel. Feeling lonely, hunky monkey? Hello! Hey, it's me, the doctor let me go, I'm waiting in the lobby. Okay, honey. Honey, don't worry, I'll be right there. Fuck! Well, you're up past your bedtime. Was I uh... was I speeding, Sheriff Garcia? No, no, no. Your bungee snapped. You're about to lose whatever's under that tarp. Oh, it's uh... yeah, it's... it's just some tools. Well, can't have anything just flying out - onto the road. - I understand. Cars running over it. Yep, you know what, I'll... I'll go fix it. No, no, sit tight. I'll take care of it. Step out of the car. We've got a problem. You lost your tools. You should circle back, see if you can find them. I'll be on the look-out. Oh, and one other thing, we uh, found your contractor floating outside your house. What? Griff? Had a dent in the back of his head that matched this. Oh my God. What? How... what... I mean... How... how long has he been dead? I'd say about a day. Wanna tell me what you were doing yesterday? I um... I was working. Working? Yeah. With a hammer? Yeah, where... where's... Where's Bree? Why... why aren't you talking to her? No one's seen her. And nothing in her history says she's ever going anywhere. Now this is what I think. Griff asked you for his money, you got into a fight with him. No. - No? - No. Or you did something to Bree. Griff found out. And you did something to Griff. - No. - That's it, isn't it? - No, that's not... - That is it. - No. - Come on, let's go. No, no, no, I need to get my wife. No, you need to get your lawyer! Alright, alright, alright! The workers said Griff walked off the job. Did that piss you off? Look, I lost my temper, but I didn't do this. You're telling me a 50-year-old woman killed a 200-pound contractor? I never touched him. Okay? That's the truth. I'll take a lie detector. Did you kill Griff? No. I had to take an Uber home from the hospital. Honey, I'm so sorry. Where are you? She got me arrested. Well, what did you do? Nothing. Are you on your way home? Yes. Honey? Lock the door. Uh. No charges. Thank you. But don't leave town. Did you know Malibu means loud surf in Chumash? Get off me, you crazy bitch! Looking for a hammer. Cute. Oh my God, oh my... Ah! Domestic dogs are members of the genus canis, they're carnivores, you know descended from wolves. So even the smallest, cuddliest little pup can smell meat from 40 feet away. So if you leave it out, they're gonna get to it everywhere in fact. Even the driveway. - Jesus Christ! - Oh. Yeah, you ready now, aren't you? You about to die! Get some pounding, huh? Are you ready to die, boy? Huh? Look at you, this is too easy, boy! Remember me, motherfucker! Huh? Remember me? No, motherfucker! Come on! I'm gonna make you my bitch right now! Honey, okay, okay. Okay. Mom, I'm home. Oh. Oh my God. Sure beats a match. Didn't matter. She was so drugged up, I could have burned the whole house down before she even woke. You killed my mother. Patricia didn't leave me much choice now, did she? Without your mother, I would still have my house, my husband would have never gotten custody, my... my boy would still be home safe with me. And I never would've had to mess with those damn brakes. Your son was in the car. Roman was supposed to be in school that day. He had a fever. And they called Steven to pick him up. Oh, you're crazy. And crazy can't win! Knox, help me! Help me please! Help me! Mommy! Hi, have you considered selling? Hmm? Best house on the water.
