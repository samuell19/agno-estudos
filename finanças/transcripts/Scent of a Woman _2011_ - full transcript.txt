Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad Lee Yeon Jae. What do you think you're doing? You stay out of it. What did you say? It's all right, Eun Seok. I'm going to ask for the last time. What is it that you really want? Do you really... want me... to leave you? Answer me. Yes. That's right. So... you're saying we're not possible. Fine. I'll do as you wish. I won't... I won't see you again. Are you sure that you really have to go this far? I loved my dad but I resented him also. Our family was a mess, and I was always so worried. I couldn't even focus at school. Why did my dad have to have cancer? Why couldn't he be like other dads and be healthy? I really hated him. If I laughed while playing with my friends, I felt guilty. "Can I really be doing this?" Eating, laughing, sleeping - all of it. It didn't feel right. If he stays with me, he'll become like that also. Someone who can't eat, laugh, or sleep, even after I die... ...for a long time. I don't want to make him like that. Good-bye. I'll take you home. No. I want to be alone. I love you. At most, it's only for 3 to 4 months. I won't... I won't see you again. What are you doing? Oh. Cleaning clothes and books. Throwing some away, and giving away what I can. Is it spring? I figured it might be nice to live simply. You're throwing this away too? Maybe I'll wear it. Are the sleeves too long? - Mom. - Why? Is it weird? Do you want me to buy you some clothes? It's all right. Unless you really want to. Let's go. How is it? You look so pretty. Mom, this is nice. This one, please. - Take a look, Mom. - This too? Since we're shopping. Are you sure you can spend so much money? So pretty. It's so pretty. It looks good on you, Mom. Why don't you get something, too? I'm fine. Wow. Coats are already out. Look, Yeon Jae. Isn't it pretty? Do you want to get this? Why already buy winter clothes? A lot of people prepare early. It's out early but not too trendy, so it'll be nice to buy it now on sale. Try it on. I'll buy this for you. It's all right, Mom. Why? You complained last year that you didn't have a nice coat. No, I'm all right. I don't think I'll need it. There's already a cool breeze in the morning and evening. Winter will be here in no time. There's already a cool breeze in the morning and evening. Winter will be here in no time. Yeon Jae. Let go. Yeon Jae. Tell me honestly. Did Mr. Kim Dong Myung molest you? Yeon Jae. Mr. Kim got fired. Good thing. Good-bye. I'm sorry, Teacher. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, Teacher. I really hated that you liked my mom. It reminded me of my deceased father. I wanted to get you away from my mom. That's why I did it. Why are you doing this all of a sudden? You've lived fine with it buried for the last 16 years. I couldn't bear it anymore. I felt burdened. Please forgive me, Teacher. Ahjussi. I came to pick up the cake. I know. Wait inside for a second. Okay. I'm... ...busy right now. Doctor. What are you staring at blankly? Doctor, you were so great dancing the tango yesterday. So awesome! But... ...how did you end up dancing with Yeon Jae unni? Why couldn't it have been with me? Oh no! The two of you didn't fall for each other while I wasn't around, did you? - We knew each other from before. - What? We went to the same grade school. Oh my. Why didn't you tell me earlier? Did I really have to tell you that? Uhm... Well... But I'm really envious. So jealous! But... how is Yeon Jae unni's condition? If it's gallbladder cancer... ...isn't it one of the most serious cancers? I'm going inside first. Weird. Really feels weird. Doctor. Doctor. Wow, Doctor! You're really something. I wouldn't have imagined you could do something like that. I heard that the woman who danced with you is a patient. Yes. When I heard that, I felt a surge of energy. It made me think... maybe I should learn something new. Well, yes. It would help with the treatments. Bye. Doctor, you're awesome. You need to save me. You're a doctor. I want to live, Eun Seok. Really want to live, Eun Seok. Help... Help me, please. Eun Seok. Eun Seok. Please. It's me. How are you feeling? Why do you look so weak? They seem to be enjoying themselves. So happy. It's a little chilly. Fall's almost here. I wish... ...time would just go by quickly. Get up. Let's walk. Aren't you leaving? Yes, I am. All right. Why don't we go out and have dinner together for a change? I'm not in the mood. Do you want to go away somewhere? You can take some time off. Florence, Provence, or wherever you want, and go clear your head. Get it off your system. It's not necessary. I'm fine. I'll go first. Isn't working out too boring? You'll hurt yourself. How long have you been running? I'm sure... ...you didn't come all this way for me. But I did. Can't you give me a chance also? Everything I've shown you so far... ...is not the real me. Go ahead. What do you want? Marriage? Fine. Let's get married... ...within this month. When are you free? Kang Ji Wook. We were supposed to get married anyway. So, let's just do it. I'm sure you're not thinking we'll date, or fall in love. Is that it? I guess that's it. I was serious when I asked you to give me a chance. I thought we could at least give it a try. I don't know why I'm like this but... I don't dislike you. So don't be cruel. You don't have the right to step on my pride. I have something to tell you. Good. I also have something to give you. What? You wanted it. I did. But... why all of a sudden... Because I just want to. Yeon Jae. What did you want to tell me? Oh... I... ...set the date. For the wedding. Really? Congratulations! When's the date, huh? When is it? The 27th. Huh? No... Not this 27th? Um... it's... I'm glad I thought about it again after I spoke with you. I found out I'm pregnant. The other family's gone crazy and just pushed everything through. It just happened. I'm so embarrassed that I can't even tell anyone. I'm already old to have a child... And it's not like I can just get an abortion. I guess this is just my lot in life. What are you talking about? I feel so sorry towards you. What do you mean sorry? I'm so glad that I can see my best friend get married. Congratulations. Hye Won, you're crying again? You two are acting really suspicious. Mom. Hye Won's getting married. What? Isn't it great? Yes. So great. Congratulations, Hye Won. Thank you. What do you want for a wedding gift? A refrigerator? Forget it. I'm going to move into his house, so I don't need anything. But I still want to get you something. How about the honeymoon? I said forget it. Then... Can you come wedding dress shopping with me? You should go with your fiance. He's working late these days. He has no taste, so he won't be of much help. All right. - Go in. - Go. - Bye. - Bye. Why couldn't she clean up after she's eaten? What does he do? Government employee. Isn't it great? What's so great? What are you going to do? What do you mean? Who else is single around you at that age? The two of you were the only ones left. If Hye Won gets married, you're the only one left. Don't you feel anything? In this situation, you're really in the mood to congratulate someone? Then don't congratulate her? What's wrong with you? Do you have no pride? Even Hye Won is getting married. Why can't you? Honestly, what does Hye Won have that you don't? How can you think such a thing? What... Are you jealous Hye Won's getting married? That's right. You're living like this and she's off getting married. I'm jealous! I'm totally jealous! Start looking for a job tomorrow. Stop doing part time work for Line Tour, and look for a real job. That way, you can at least meet a man. I'm embarrassed that you're not working, that I can't even ask anyone to introduce you to someone. It's not like it's been only a couple of days. I can't stand seeing you mope around the house like this. Go and get a job right now. All right? - No. - What? You've been playing for over a month! How long are you going to mope around without a job then? Don't you think you're pathetic? Stop it please! You don't even know anything. What don't I know? What? Do you... Do you think I feel at peace? Hye Won's wedding... Do you think I'm just happy about it? So get married then! Why don't you try? Just try! You're really driving me mad! You haven't eaten anything. I made some stew, so please make sure to eat some. I'm leaving now. Ahjummoni. Yes? That pot... Please put it where I can't see it. All right. Get some rest. Where do you want to go? Welcome. This way, please. We'll just look around ourselves. Of course. Pick out a car for me. I don't know much about it. Should I just look at the design? I don't need to worry about the price or fuel economy. Right? That's right. Yeah. A friend's getting married, and I agreed to go wedding dress shopping with her. How about dinner? I'm going to eat with her. Oh, I see. Don't eat anything that's bad for you. Even if you're around people drinking, don't drink. All right. Doctor. Patient. Oh. Yes. Eun Seok. Huh? I'm sure you're busy. You don't have to call me every day. Did I? Yes. I have to go out. I'm hanging up now. Bye. Mom. I'm going to have dinner with Hye Won, so don't wait for me. How is it? Pretty. Really? Yes. Does my stomach stick out? No. What if people make fun of me because I'm such an old bride? Is it too tight at the waist? Why? It fits perfectly. It's because I'm pregnant. Oh really? Congratulations. Thank you. Then should I make it a little bit roomier at the waist? Yes, please. Hye Won. Your phone is ringing. Yes. I'm trying it on. Why? Now? How can you forget something like that? What to do? I was going to have dinner. I'm so sorry. He told his aunt to meet me and forgot to tell me. That's how he is. Don't worry. Get going. Sorry. - I'll buy you dinner next time. - Okay. Go. - Bye. - Hurry up! You're the bride's friend. Right? Did you leave something behind? No. I'm sorry... ...but can I try on a wedding dress? Sure. We're done. It really looks great on you. You must be getting married soon. When a woman wants to try on a wedding dress, they end up getting married quickly. Can you... ...take a picture of me? Just a moment. How's the America project going? It's proceeding well. I'm just monitoring the progress. Should I get dinner prepared for you? In a little bit. Sure. Also, I invited Se Kyung. I heard you're seeing her again. Father. Oh. Welcome. The meeting went a little late. I see. How is your father's health? He's all right. That's good to hear. I was really happy to hear that the two of you are seeing each other again. The engagement didn't go smoothly, but not too many people know about it, so no need to worry. Since things have turned out this way, how about we forgo the engagement, and just get ready for the wedding? What do you think, Se Kyung? - Father. - Yes? We'll take care of it. Let us keep seeing each other and if we like each other, then I'm sure we'll date or get married. And if we don't like each other, that'll be the end of it. That's how everyone else does it. That's how I want to do it. So Father, please just let it be. Ji Wook is right. We've only been on two dates. All right. Either way, I feel better. Do you want to come upstairs for a cup of tea? Next time. When will you actually enjoy spending time with me? Well... Not sure yet. Get some rest. [Yeon Jae's Bucket List 20 things to do before I die...] [1. Make my mom laugh once a day] [3. Learn the Tango!] [4. Whatever I want, eat, see...] [5. Try on a wedding dress.] I love you. I won't... I won't see you again. Goodness. What happened here? Did you do this? Are you crazy? Why would you make such a mess? Yeon Jae. What's wrong? Are you drunk? It's too hard. It's... ...too hard, Mom. I'm so upset. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I'm sure you were upset about Hye Won's wedding also. I'm sorry. All right? It's okay. Hello. What brings you here? Patient Lee Yeon Jae. Yes? Director Byung would like to invite her to dinner. Director Byung? Yes. Not only for donating over 50 million won, but also, her tango dancing with you has given hope and provided a great message to other patients. He's thankful, so he wants to treat her to dinner. Give her a call and set a date. Of course. Yeon Jae. I have to go out to the store... What's this? When did she clean it all up? It's me. It's not Yeon Jae, but her mom. Oh. Hello! I'm sorry, but Yeon Jae can't answer the phone right now. Why? She must have gone out without her phone. If you need to tell her something, tell me. I'll relay the message. It's all right. I'll call back later. Okay, then. Don't forget to call back. Yes. Why has she been like this recently? [Groom: Tae Hoon Bride: Hye Won Date: Aug 27, 2011 at 11.00 am] Congratulations. Thank you. Umm... General Manager. Are you going to break up with Yeon Jae like this? Yeon Jae really likes you. That fool fell for you at first sight. You really like her a lot, too. Isn't that why you broke off your engagement? So... can't you continue to stand by Yeon Jae's side? It's already all over. So you're... ...just going to let it end like this? That's what Lee Yeon Jae wants. But Yeon Jae's doing it for you, because she's thinking about you. So that's what I'm going to do... ...exactly what Lee Yeon Jae wants. You can leave. All right. Hi, Ahjumma. Are you by chance with Yeon Jae? No. Why? She left her cell phone at home. But I feel a little uneasy. She's been a little odd these past few days. She's drinking, and she broke all the pots that she loves. I'm sure it's nothing much. Don't worry about it. I'm sure she didn't go anywhere far. Sure. If she calls me, I'll let you know. Yes. Good-bye. Really? She didn't come to the hospital. All right. I'll call you right away. Hello. Patient Lee Yeon Jae... Has she made her next appointment? No. This is Chae Eun Seok. And? By chance, are you with Yeon Jae right now? No. Is something wrong? It's nothing. If it's nothing, why are you calling me? If Yeon Sae contacts you, please call me right away. I'll hang up now. President, take this. What is it? Teacher, I knew I've needed to beg for forgiveness a long time ago. But I couldn't do it. I just didn't have the courage. I know it's selfish of me to expect pardon by just saying "I'm sorry." However, I think I still need to say this. Thank you for concealing my deplorable lie. Is Lee Yeon Jae here? No, she's not. Did something happen to Audrey? If she stops by, please give me a call. Sure. The intermediate tango class starts next week... You still can't get in touch with her? No. I came by the studio, but she's not here. Do you think there are other places she might go besides here? All right. I'll look for her. Right now I am crying as I look into your eyes I'm crying as I look into your heart I don't want you by me. I don't want you to see me die next to you. All the foolish, pretty dreams All the thoughtless actions Day by day, your actions create memories I remember even your frail hands and tousled hair Have you found her? Yes. Where is she? Yes. That's right. I will erase your aching love, your tears and your painful scars I love you I love you I want to live with memories of you What are you doing here? Do you know how much I worried about you? How... ...did you know this place? Kang Ji Wook told me. He came here? If it's going to be like this, why did you break up with him? Why? If it's too hard, go and hold onto him, instead of hurting like this! Eun Seok. I wish... ...that my life would just end right now. Lee Yeon Jae! Don't worry. They have found her, so I'm sure she'll be home very soon. There's something wrong. Is there something wrong with Yeon Jae? She's not someone who does this. Quitting her job like that, and lately, she's been acting so differently. Hye Won, do you know anything? I'm not sure. Where were you? Do you know how much I worried about you? You little... You're not a teenager. Why have you been causing me so much grief lately? Later. Wait until later. Come inside. She's really killing me. Are you... ...by chance from that blind date? Yes. - You called during the day, right? - Yes. I saw you once before also, when you came to pick up Yeon Jae. Ahh... I see. How do you know Yeon Jae? We went to the same grade school. Please take care of Yeon Jae. Good-bye. All right. What does he mean by "take care of her" ? Should... I not get married? I feel so bad. Because I said I was getting married. It's nothing like that. Yeon Jae... Hye Won... I'm tired. I'm going to get some sleep. All right. Sleep. She got home safely. All right. Kang Ji Wook... Thank you for today. How much did you give? 50,000 won. Goodness, so cheap. That's all you're giving as Section Chief? How much did you put in, Director? 200,000. Wow! 200,000? Minus 100,000. You're not going to see the bride? You're here. Wow. Wow! You look so pretty. Be good to the groom. You should be thankful he's marrying you. Goodness, Director! Anyway, Bong Gil, what's wrong with you? You'll be 40 in a couple of days. Oh my. You're not 40 yet? By chance, have you seen Yeon Jae? I don't want to see her. Why isn't she here yet? Why are you here now? I thought you weren't coming. You look so pretty. My friend. I'm... ...wearing the earrings that you gave me. Be happy and live a long, long life. Okay? Don't cry. Your makeup's going to be ruined. The ceremony's going to start. She said it's going to start. Wipe your tears now. Okay. Let's go. When I miss you, always be together When I'm happy, always laugh together This tragic love Even this very moment, I will guard it Bride enter. Can only stand by Unable to do anything So stupid So foolish This is who loves you Its scent lingers in my heart The love that you saved only for me So grateful So thankful This is who sees only you When I miss you, always be together When I'm sorrowful, always cry together Without a sound Don't cry so painfully Always be with me and look at me only Always, like this This tragic love Even this very moment, I will guard it Always by my side, stay with me Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad Main Translator: dw4p Spot Translator: fore Timer: alodia Editor/QC: rambutan Coordinators: mily2, ay_link
