The weapons we kept safely inside the office, were taken outside. My opinion is that what he did was right. Didn't you bring those weapons in those sacks to kill people in this area? And those who die, are the ones who run helter skelter for even one meal. It's about someone else being appointed instead of me at Ashokettan's shop. What? - Do you have some quicklime?
