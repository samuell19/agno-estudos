I want to make the transition of next year's student government as seamless as possible, - so that when I'm up in New Haven... - Yale. You can just say Yale, please. Well, our class's official policy is to not discuss where anyone is attending next year. We don't want them to feel insecure. Very thoughtful. I need to go over the end of the year budget numbers we have. [sighs] Gosh. Really? Like, now? I mean, why don't you do it with Nick? You know, please? I mean, he's... you know, he's the vice president. Nick? - [boy] Oh! - [laughter] We both know that Nick only ran for VP because they plan the dances. That position is... It's basically a popularity contest. He's useless. Ladies, it's the last day, you know? We did it, huh? We got you through high school. Can't we just graduate, head off to college, you know, celebrate this wonderful achievement? Let's get through the day without anything horrible happening. Sorry, are you shutting the door on us? Not subtle. We will persist! Nick's like the great equalizer. Delegates from every group of girls are casting their ballots for his penis. Oh, Triple A takes the lead. Don't call her that. Everybody calls her that. She gave roadside assistance to three senior guys last year. [Amy] You hear them getting degrading nicknames? They call Sam Ross "Dick Splinter." That's not derogatory, it's a factual description. - 7:20. - [Molly] Under eight minutes? - You're joking! - Aah! Oh, my God. 9:43. What am I gonna do without you girls next year? Nobody around here even attempts the Thursday. Well, Amy and I are gonna Skype the puzzle every single week, - so we will send you our Sunday Times. - Yep. You know what? Why don't I just give you two my number? That way, you guys can call or text me if you need anything. - Yeah! That would make our lives. - Yeah.

[chuckles] [boy] Hey, Miss Fine? You should come party with us tonight. Did you just ask Miss Fine if she wants to party with you? You think she wants to watch you get drunk and break things? Hold on. I was having a conversation with her. You're not part of this. - I'm... - Sit down, Theo. [boy] Yo, yo. What up, Miss Fine? Just a last day present for my favorite teach. - Jared, you are not my student. - I've heard great things. And, hey, everybody else got their graduation gifts, right? Come on. Jare Bear coming at you from all angles, right? - Nobody asked for that. - Uhh... Big me, littler me, little baby Jared at the bottom. Baby Jared says, "Happy graduation, everybody!" Yeah, no one's gonna wear a shirt with your face on it, Jared. Like, not even ironically. Okay, well, agree to disagree, 'cause... Jared, just go. I'm out of here. Wasn't even here.

I'm saving lives. Oh, okay. Well, that's actually noble. I, too, have a fear of big cats. And I can't because I'm working all summer, and also, I don't want to. You are a philistine. Why would you do theater when you could do debate? [scoffs] Because some of us enjoy working with others. And some of us know how to win. Nobody's winning in that outfit. [Miss Fine] Sit down, y'all. We got work to do. - So, Molly... - Mmm? - Why don't you start us off? - Thank you. - [groaning] - Kill it.

Let's go home. - Amy... - Don't do your lecture voice. That was not a party. Well, it definitely was a party. That was a detour. We are A-plus people, and we are going to an A-plus party. Like this.

You should call. I'm gonna go home. But if you wanna go to Nick's, you should really go. Seriously, go. Malala. Whoa. - I'm calling Malala. - Wow. You know you only get, like, one Malala a year? Yeah, I'm calling it. Full support, no questions asked, you are coming with me. Hmm. [inhales deeply] [sighs] Malala. All right. Malala. [dance music plays] [Amy] Oh! [Molly] Oh! Um... okay. Jordan? Yeah, and you're Am... Shit. You know, I-I, um... this job's a good way to supplement the, uh... the old income.

[chuckles] - [whispers] Friends? - Plus, I'm writin' a book now. [both] Oh. - Yeah, yeah. I'm not just a principal. - Cool. Nothing more exciting or daunting than the blank page, you know? One book I'm thinkin' about doin' is a book of quotes. Nothing more daunting or exciting than the blank page. But, yeah, that's one idea. I'm thinkin' about doin' a detective novel. Actually, you know what? You two will love... Amy, you'll love this. It's a, uh... a female detective. - Oh, really? - A lady detective. - Yeah, how about that? - Interesting. Yeah, she's, uh... And she's pregnant too. Still workin'. And, uh, you know, the baby, whenever she's, like, close to a clue, or, like, one of her hunches is, like, uh, you know, close, the baby kicks, you know, and the harder it kicks, the closer she is. And, uh, that's where I'm at right now. I... I... I don't know what to do once, um... you know, when she, um, gives birth. - But, um... - [Amy] Hmm. - [horns blare] - Hey, you dumb son of a bitch!

By the way, I am pretty impressed with how well you guys are holding it together. You're doing fantastic. What do you mean? I thought the strawberries would have hit by now.

I know this is unrealistic and bad for women, but... is it bad? Because I feel pretty good. I mean, this ass won't quit. Amy, use your brain! I don't need to use my brain. I just need to be smooth and flexible. Look at you, you bad bitch. Okay, that's it, we have to wake up. My, my, my. Mm. [grunts] I think I might, like, actually stay here for a while. No, I won't let you do this. Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop! [grunts] You need to throw up. Let me have this body!

Which is why we have to stick to the plan. Let's call another Lyft. Why are you being so pushy? Honestly, pushy is a compliment. You know who else was pushy? Diane Sawyer, Joan of Arc, - Queen Noor of Jordan... - I know where Queen Noor is from! Once we get to Nick's, all of this will be worth it. Just forget about about Nick's! No one will even tell us where it is. Why are you being so obsessed with his party? - [Gigi] Because she loves him. - Oh, my God. Gigi, stop doing that! - What did you say? - Molly loves Nick. Can you please stop repeating that sentence? Because it's not true. - Molly hates Nick. - Thank you. She projects disgust to cover up a deep desire. No. No. N-O. Thanks. Uh, you actually... You drugged us and tried to throw us off a boat. I did. I did. So nothing you say is of any value to us. - So... Oh, you're... - [trilling] Yeah, no, you can stop flipping me off because you should flip off, so shut the fuck up. - [growls] - Madam Mayor, what are you doing out here? George locked himself in the closet. [Gigi] Fuck! - Dude. - [door closes] No. Dude? No. I don't like him. [sighing] Yes, maybe he is... classically, traditionally handsome and weirdly charming, and maybe my innate biology registers him as an ideal mate, and yes, maybe I occasionally fantasize about him sweeping me off my feet. And some weaker people might call that a tiny crush, but I can ignore it, I can fight against it, because we all have weird interests. And the important thing is that we just... we shove 'em down and we never speak about them again. You don't have to shove anything down. [inhales] Yeah. [chuckling] Yeah. Yeah, I do, because I can't like him. Maybe my body can like him but my mind knows that that's stupid, because he's just... he's a jock, and all he cares about is being cool and having fun, and he doesn't even look at girls unless they look like Triple A. And he definitely doesn't want me because I'm a butter personality. How dare you say that about my best friend? Amy, you fucking slapped me... If you ever say anything like that about yourself again, I will fucking lay you out, okay? You are the strongest, coolest, smartest, most stunningly gorgeous creature this high school and this Earth has ever seen. And Nick Howland would be so fucking lucky to be a footnote in your story. So we're going to his party. Are you serious? I am dead serious. If Nick's what you want, then that's what you deserve. How? How are we gonna find out where the party is? By doing what we do best.
