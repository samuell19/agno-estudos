Honey... There is no deity except God. There is no deity... except God. And Muhammad is the Messenger of God. And Muhammad... is the Messenger... of God. Oh God, why? Why? Oh, God! THREE MONTHS LATER KORAN Hurry up, Maria. What took you so long in the kitchen? Is it so hard to make a drink? If so, I'll make it myself next time. It's not a big deal. Relax, Zeti. Maria is your stepdaughter. Don't make her feel bad. It's not because she's my stepdaughter. I love her despite being almost the same age as her. I treat her like my own daughter. Do you really love my daughter? Maria. Did you open this? Amir, come here. Amir, you've grown up. Stop playing with toys like a little kid. Dad, I dreamed about Mom. And she told me that she's coming back soon. Do you miss your mom? As much as I do? Yes. Dad, when will Mom be coming back? Amir, she has passed away. Every living thing in this world has a lifetime. There will come a day when that lifetime will end, just like your mom's. I understand. -But Mom-- -Amir. She has passed away. She won't be coming back anymore. Dad, can you accept the truth that she has passed away? You don't love her, do you? Amir, it's not that I don't love her-- Amir! Amen. When you've grown up, I might not be here anymore. Remember to visit our graves because it will remind you of death and the Afterlife. Remember what I said. Why do you want to meet me today? If we are here for personal matters, then no thanks. As your boss, I have the right to know about your personal matters. I also have the right to know what is happening to you. What do you mean? Where did you get these pills? -Did you go through my things? -You were not like this, Maria. Why did you suddenly become depressed? Tell me what's wrong. Just tell me your problem. Perhaps I can help you. It's none of your business! Maria. You know that I care about you. Can we be like how we used to be? I miss the old you. Bring her back. I'm leaving. Excuse me. Ustaz. -Peace be upon you, Shah. -And peace be upon you too. -How are you, Ustaz? -I'm good. Shah, how's your wife doing? Is she getting better? Thanks to your treatment, she's doing fine now. No more screaming like before. She is getting better not because of me, Shah. I did my best to heal her, but God made it happen. I heard that you've stopped helping the people in the village, is that true? Dad, what happened? Here, have a drink, Azman. How much longer do you want to be like this, Adam? Can you stop isolating yourself at home? Imam Ali and the others from the mosque are all concerned about you. When do you want to start working? Are you going to leave your farm and your garden like that? Remember, Adam. Our jobs are a form of worship to God. Any updates regarding the hit-and-run accident? Haven't the police found out who caused my wife's death? Just leave it to God, Adam. I know that I'm not in your position. And I understand what you're going through right now. I just want to remind you of one thing. Please come back to our mosque because-- There is no better place to seek peace other than the mosque. I understand, Azman. I really do, but... Hey, Adam. Have faith! Since I've known you, I know you are not... a grumpy and vengeful person. What's wrong with you, Adam? I'm your best friend and I care about you, Adam. You know it, don't you? We can be impulsive and reckless. Our faith falters at times. We have to be careful! Throw your vengeance spite away. Learn how to forgive! I won't forgive them. That will never happen. I won't forgive the person who caused her death. It's Zulaikha, my wife, you know? Don't blame me for acting this way. Blame the person who took my happiness away. This person murdered my wife! Adam. REPENTANCE SPIRIT &amp; SATAN IN HUMAN'S LIFE THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SATAN SATANIC MOVEMENT Indeed, Satan is an enemy to you. So take him for an enemy. Satan is the one who wants to make you his inmates in the burning Hell. Did I not enjoin upon you, O children of Adam? Do not worship Satan because Satan is your absolute enemy. God, have mercy! Please turn the lights on! God, have mercy on us. What's wrong? What happened? I saw you rushing out of the lift. Did someone bother you? In life, we have to face two things. Firstly, the catastrophe. Secondly, blessings. As a human being, we have to accept the truth. That's easy for you to say, Imam. Maybe because you've never been in my shoes. I know that salvation doesn't come easy, but sometimes I think, "Why did God give me such a difficult test?" All of the answers about life are stated in the Koran and God has answered all of your questions. God won't burden us beyond what we can endure. Ask God for guidance to lift you off from the burden so that your heart will be at peace. It's good if you can forgive the person who caused your wife's death. No, Imam. It's not that easy. It's impossible for me to forgive that person. Adam. God knows everything. As long as you don't forgive them, you won't be at peace. You won't find out who killed your wife if you behave like this. If God is willing, once you have forgiven the person who did this, God will guide you. God will open your heart and your eyes to the truth. God, have mercy on us. God, have mercy on us. I don't know what's wrong with your daughter. Supposedly, people of faith, if they pray often, their souls should be at peace, but she seems more depressed every day. Even though she's like that, I'm so thankful because faith doesn't come without hardship. Honey, what is her problem exactly? She seems to be hiding something from us. Did she become depressed because of me? I feel uneasy around her. I'm like a stranger to her. Maybe she has other things bothering her. I'll talk to her myself. What bothers me is that she's been studying about Satan in the Koran and the Hadith. She could study other things. The Koran is not only about Satan and evil spirits. Damn it. Such a bother. Thank you so much, Fazli. You helped Maria fix her car and sent her home last night. I was just passing by. If I wasn't there, I don't know what would've happened to Maria. Didn't I tell you that I care about you? I know your situation. What do you mean? What's wrong with me? I'm sorry if I've been troubling you guys. It's okay, Zeti. By the way, have you told her about my plan on marrying her? I can take care of her. I understand, but it's not the right time to tell her yet. If not now, how long do I still need to wait? Zulaikha. Zulaikha. Zulaikha! Zulaikha! Zulaikha! Zulaikha. Zulaikha. Zulaikha. Please accept the truth no matter how sad you are. God will turn your life around and bless you with the life you may not have expected. God... God. God... God knows everything, honey. I... I miss you, Zulaikha. Many people desire salvation. And many people long with their whole heart to embrace God because of the suffering of the world. Wait for me, Zulaikha. God, have mercy on us. Amir misses you too. Dad. Dad! -What's wrong, Amir? -Grandpa is here. Come. Dad, why didn't you call me before you came? Because I knew you would be at home. Anyway, I won't be here long, just a couple of days. How are you? I've been great. Amir is on a school break. At least, he can keep me company. Actually, your mom is the one who asked me to come and visit you. She's been worrying about you. She told me that she had bad dreams about you. What did she even dream about? -I'm sure I'm going to be okay. -Really? Are you sure you are fine? -Perhaps-- -Dad. Let me show you to your room. God, have mercy on us. God, have mercy on us. Maria? Maria... Peace be upon you, Imam. Yes. Then what now, Imam? If you are free, please come and help Mr. Osman's daughter. She is from the same village as us. According to Mr. Osman's wife, she's very ill. I... It's not that I don't want to help, Imam. I... How about this, Imam? You can call Ustaz Saiful. I think he can help you out. I'm not free right now. Ustaz Saiful isn't available at the moment, Adam. He will only be coming back from Mecca next week. Please help, Adam. Perhaps now is the time for you to come back to work. To help and perform the ruqyah on the villagers. All right, Imam. I'll be right over. Go ahead, Adam. It's been a while since you stopped curing people. Please don't waste the abilities that God has given you. Peace be upon you. And peace be upon you too. Could you explain to us what happened? Ustaz Adam needs to know that. I was in the kitchen doing some chores. Then I heard Maria screaming. When I found her, she was already lying on the floor. -How is she now? -I was trying to calm her down, but she pushed me away and stormed off to the living room. What's your opinion, Adam? I'm sorry for asking. Are there any talismans in your house? Talismans to protect your house? We have to hurry, Adam. -Can we go and have a look? -Sure. Her room is at the far end of the house. Maria, we are here to help you. But you have to calm down and say your prayers. If you can't recite it in your mouth, -then recite it in your heart. -Azman. Help me, Ustaz. Please help me, Ustaz. This Imam has taken a liking to me. He did this to me, Ustaz. Get rid of him. I have never missed a single prayer session. I pray day and night. I wake up every night to perform night prayers so I can worship God! Glory be to God. Praise be to God. There is no God but God. God is Great! Stop lying, you cursed Satan. Stop the facade. -I seek refuge from God. -In the name of God. In the name of God, the beneficent, the merciful. Wherever you may be, God will bring you forth for judgment altogether. Indeed, God is over all things competent. God, have mercy on us. Adam, where's Maria? Maria! Maria! Where did she go, Adam? Maria. Adam, where did Maria go? God, have mercy on us. I've worshiped God thousands of years ago! God created me to be His best creation! I am a Muslim genie! I am a Muslim genie! I want to help this woman! A good, God-fearing Muslim genie will not harm and mislead humans. Since you're hurting this woman, you are nothing but evil! Leave this woman's body. Otherwise, I'll destroy you in the name of God. I will harm you with His permission! -Leave! -You deserve to be thrown into Hell! You deserve to die! I seek refuge in God from Satan the outcast. In the name of God, the beneficent, the merciful. We said, "Fear not. Indeed, it is you who are superior. And throw what is in your right hand; it will swallow up what they have crafted. It is but the trick of a magician and the magician will not succeed wherever he is." So the magicians fell down in prostration. They said, "We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses." Keep going, Azman! You deserve to die! May you live in blasphemy and turn yourself from Islam! Non-believers! -Infidel. -Apostates! -Hypocrites! -Renegade. My sole purpose is to make Muslims go astray! So the truth was established and abolished was what they were doing. And Pharaoh and his people were overcome right there and became debased. And the magicians fell down in prostration to God. They said, "We have believed in the Lord of the worlds, the Lord of Moses and Aaron." God is Great! I seek refuge in God from Satan the outcast. In the name of God, the beneficent, the merciful. God is Great! You filthy humans. What kind of spell are you using? Who are you? I am Adam, a servant of God, and an enemy of Satan. Get lost! I won't get out of here! Leave, you cursed Satan! Leave this woman's body. I won't leave this woman's body. -In the name of God. -If I do so, my master won't feed me. -And when they had thrown, Moses said, -In the name of God. "Indeed, God will expose its worthlessness. Indeed, God does not amend the work of corrupters. And God will establish the truth by His words, even if the criminals dislike it." But no one believed Moses, except for some youths among his people, for fear of Pharaoh-- There's one more evil force coming. Watch out! He's a descendant of Satan! He'll mislead all the followers of the Prophet and turn them against the Koran! Who amongst you will come against us, you cursed Satan? Dajjal! Glory be to God. Praise be to God. There is no God but God. God is Great! He is the All-Hearing the All-Knowing. Maria. -There is no power nor strength -My goodness. except in God, the Lofty, the Great. There is no power nor strength except in God, the Lofty, the Great. There are none worthy of worship besides you. Glorified are you. Surely, I'm from among the wrongdoers. How is she, Adam? Is everything settled? It's complicated, Imam. Somebody has sent an evil spirit to disturb her. Maria vomited nails just now. I'm sure she has been cursed. Has she fully recovered? Such evil spirits have many ways of corrupting innocence. We can pray for her for now. What is happening to our community? Is there no end to this madness? -Shame on us. -Shame on us or shame on religion? Which one do you think is worse? All right, Azman. Help me perform the call of prayer in each room of the house. -Imam, feel free to help him. -All right. I hope Ustaz can come and visit Maria again. Before this, I sought help elsewhere, but her condition is still getting worse. As human beings, we shouldn't be afraid of Satan. As long as God honors the likes of man, we are better than evil spirits in the eyes of God. I understand, but when will this end? Until when? I can't stand it anymore. -Should I call other people for help? -Everything happens because of Him. Have strong beliefs in the Koran and Sunnah. The reason why Maria hasn't recovered yet isn't because Islam is weak, but it is us who are weak. Sorry, I was in a meeting when you called me. How's Maria? I'm not sure, but she's inside the house now. Luckily Ustaz Adam was here to help. Why did you ask for their help? How much do you have to pay? RM100 or RM200? You must've had to donate to the mosque before they even lifted a finger. Adam. Peace be upon you. Why were you being so rude to them, Fazli? They've been a part of our village's mosque for a long time! People nowadays disguise themselves as religious leaders to cheat our money. You saw what they were wearing just now. The outfits are sold everywhere. I've been cheated by these kinds of people more than once. I don't want you to end up being cheated by them. Many people will try to cheat you since you're a woman. YOU HAVE TO COME BACK TO ME, ZULAIKHA! AMIR REALLY NEEDS YOU! Dad, what are you doing in my bedroom? What are you looking for? Nothing, I was just looking around. Dad. Is it wrong, Dad? Is it wrong for a husband to miss his late wife? Of course, it's not wrong. -But you-- -Is it wrong for me to express my feelings to my late wife in this letter? You think I'm a bad person by hiding something from you? I've never thought of that, Adam. I'm just confused. There are a lot of things I don't understand. You must have been having bad thoughts about me. If not, you wouldn't have come into my room. Zulaikha has just... She has just passed away, Dad. You should support me at this moment, instead of... Maria, where's my stuff? You better give it back to me now! What stuff? I've never taken your stuff. Stop lying! I saw you holding it the other day. What stuff? You mean the small box? Who else other than you would take my stuff? Where did you hide it? -What are you doing? -Where did you put it? -I've never taken your stuff. -It is very important and priceless to me! I swear to God, I've never taken your stuff. Hey, you've been distracted the whole day. How about this, Fazli? You don't know how to treat her right, that's why she rejected you. Why would she reject me? I've told her we would be getting married. Why are you so desperate to marry her? Come on, she's pretending to be religious. What a hypocrite. Mind your words. It's my choice whether to marry her or not. It's none of your business. I'm asking you right now, how long you intend to wait? I know Maria's dad is rich despite him being a village man. I think this is a game. Do you desire her dad's assets? Maybe her dad is sick because of the thing that you sent him. -It worked? -Yes, that's why we are talking about it. I didn't know you're the type to do that. Hey, Fazli! Are you crazy? Fazli! God, have mercy on us. Fazli, do you want to kill him? Hey, you're killing him! Fazli! Stop it! Have you lost your mind? Are you crazy? Son of a bitch. Hey. My goodness. Maria. Where are you going? If you are still mad at me, I'm sorry. I can't stand this anymore. Your dad is sick, so are you. I'm all alone. I'm lost! Your heart is black! You're rotten to the core! I know you are happy when I'm sick. You want my dad to die so that you can inherit his fortune! You are the troublemaker of our family! A wench like you will face the consequences! Why did you slap me, Maria? Maria! Let go of me, Maria! It hurts! Let go of me! God, have mercy. Let go of me, Maria. Please let go of me. Hey. Amir, what are you doing in my bedroom? When did you come in? Why aren't you sleeping with Grandpa? I dreamed about Mom. She said she'll be back tonight, but I'm scared because Mom is very angry with you this time. God, have mercy on us. Amir. Why did you dream about such things? Come on. Let's go to Grandpa's room. Peace be upon you. And peace be-- Don't answer her, Amir. Dad? Is Grandpa in his bedroom, Amir? Dad, is that you? Dad! -Amir, wait for me here. -Okay. Maria, listen. How many times have I told you? I love you and I want to marry you. I mean it. Maria, do you hear what I am saying? Do you know why I don't want to get married to you? Because I'm falling in love with the guy who helped me. Ustaz Adam. Nowadays, it's difficult to find this kind of person. A person of faith whose heart is filled with doubt. What is your relationship with him? Maria, you have to think about his intentions. He is just using you. Don't trust him, Maria. He's a cheater! Don't believe a single word he says. Stop being so obsessed with him. To make things clear, I want you to tell you this. I already slept with him. Honey, Maria tried to kill me just now. She slapped me and dragged me across the floor. Who does she think I am? I'm her stepmom, not some stranger. Is this true? We are only married for one year and you want-- You think I'm making this up? You think I'm slandering her? Her condition is getting worse. She wasn't herself when she was talking to me just now. I'll call Ustaz Adam to come and help Maria. I heard a ruckus this morning. What's wrong? I had an argument with Maria. I thought she took my box, but it wasn't her. I think your best friend, Imam Ali, has taken it. Doesn't he visit you often? The problem is, the thing inside the box is alive. Goodness! God, have mercy! God, have mercy! God, have mercy-- Maria. It's okay. Let her be. In the name of God, the beneficent, the merciful. God, send blessings to Muhammad and his family. O God, send blessings to Muhammad and his family. O God, send blessings to Muhammad and his family. There are none worthy of worship besides you. Glorified are you. Surely, I'm from among the wrongdoers. You are my greatest enemy on earth! True believers like you! In the name of God, the beneficent, the merciful. There is no deity except Him. The Ever-Living, the sustainer of existence. Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission? -He knows what is presently before them... -I will make you fear everything -And they encompass not a thing... -except God! Except for what He wills. His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth. And their preservation tires Him not. And He is the Most High, the Most Great! God, have mercy! Hold her! I seek refuge in God from Satan the outcast. In the name of God, the beneficent, the merciful. And We inspired to Moses, "Throw your staff," and at once, -it devoured what they were falsifying. -I want human beings to weep! ...and abolished was what they were doing. -Pharaoh and his people were overcome... -And burn with me in Hell! And the magicians fell down in prostration to God. They said, "We have believed in the Lord of the worlds, the Lord of Moses and Aaron." We seek refuge in Your names, dear God. Leave now! Hurry up, Zeti. Zeti, get back! The Ever-Living, the sustainer of existence. Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is presently... Watch her, Zeti! Maria. -In the name of God. -My goodness. -Sir, I'm sorry, but you can't enter. -I want to see Imam! -Sorry, sir. -Sir! Can I see him? In the name of God, the beneficent, the merciful. God, have mercy on us. Goodness. God, have mercy on us. Mr. Osman! Mr. Osman! Ustaz! Why were you screaming? What happened? -Mr. Osman is missing. -What? What? Wasn't he in his bedroom just now? Yes, but he's missing now! Your husband is not here! Do you understand? What? Oh, God. What should we do? Ustaz, where are you going? -Peace be upon you, Azman. -And peace be upon you too. Adam, Imam Ali... Imam Ali passed away about an hour ago. What? Indeed we belong to God, and indeed to Him we will return. -Where are you now? -His body was found at Batu 16. Adam, come here quickly. Goodness, how can this be happening? -Was he in a car crash? -I don't know. The police are still investigating it. But from what I've heard, something strange happened to him. What is happening? Adam, please come here quickly. Something strange? What are you talking about? I'm wondering if Imam Ali's death has something to do with Maria. Even Mr. Osman, Maria's dad, is missing now! Yes, Amir? Why are you suddenly calling me? I'll come home later. Can you pass my call to Grandpa? He is not at home. He's been out for a long time. I don't know where he went. Where did he go? How could he leave you alone at home? It's all right. Mom is here with me. Please stop saying that, Amir. I've had enough of that nonsense. Don't worry, Dad. Mom is taking care of me right now. Don't you understand? I've told you many times not to mention her! I don't want to hear about it, do you understand me? You're driving me crazy by asking about her every day, you know? Why don't you understand? Are you deaf? Please forgive me, Zulaikha. Please forgive me. Amir! Amir! Stop right there! -Where do you think you're going? -Dad! -Wake up! -Dad! -Dad, stop! -You want to see your mom so much, right? -Dad, stop! -You miss your mom so much, right? -You want to see her, right? -Dad, let go of me! -Here she is! See for yourself! -Dad! She's right in front of you now, Amir. I... I went to her grave and dug her body out for you! Just for you, Amir. I did this because I love you. This is what I have to do. I assure you. After this, you will forget about your mom. And I don't want you to say that you miss her anymore! You will forget about her forever. What are you waiting for? Go hug and kiss her! Express all of your feelings towards her! Dad, you are crazy! Hey, stop right there! You've been giving me shit all this while! Where are you going? I'm losing my mind because of you! Screw you, bastard! How dare you! Dad, please... You should die! I seek refuge in God from Satan the outcast. What else do we need to investigate about Imam's death? There's nothing else to be investigated. Let us accept the truth that he has passed away. Goodness. I have a bad feeling. Do you remember what I told you last night? I have a strong hunch that Imam Ali's death is related to Maria. What's the meaning behind all of this? Can you please stop talking about Maria? Tell me. What does Maria have to do with his death? I don't think so, Adam. What we should do now is pray for Imam so that he can rest in peace! -The problem is-- -What else? You are the one with the problem. You are doubtful! What are you looking for? You're my best friend. But sometimes, I don't know what is on your mind ever since your wife-- Peace be upon you. -And peace be upon you too. -We are the police. We would like to see Mr. Adam regarding the missing of Maria's dad. I see. Adam. The police are here to seek your help regarding Maria's dad. I don't understand. In the Koran, why does God refers to Himself as "I" and at other times "We"? Can you stop disturbing me? Don't you feel sad for what has happened? But I want to know why! Why does God refer to Himself as "We"! Goodness, Maria. What kind of question is that? Don't you know the answer? What have you been studying? Because someone came to me in my dream and told me -that God refers to Himself and-- -God, have mercy on us. Maria, it was Satan who was talking to you in your dream. And you believed what it said to you? When God uses "We", it means He refers to His greatness! Do you understand? Pray to God, Maria! Peace be upon you. Why are you outside? Didn't my dad invite you in? What's the matter-- Hypocrites like you can fool anyone, but me. People like you have no respect! God, have mercy. What's wrong with you? Why are you suddenly slandering me? Stop acting like an angel! Stop being a hypocrite! How many other women have you slept with? Who knows if you slept with married women. Maria told me everything. You do know she is not well, right? You shouldn't believe what she says. Her words might not be her own, but Satan's! Hypocrites like you don't get to talk to me about religion! You don't fool me, you false prophet! Instead of God, people like you worship their own desires! Keep in mind. Sooner or later, everyone will know the real you. Adam! Go away! Get away from me! If you mess with me, I'll kill you! You are the reason my dad is missing, aren't you? Stay away from me! Move closer and I'll kill you. God, have mercy on us. Maria, what's wrong with you? What did you think I was going to do? I just wanted to give you this cup of prayer water. Instead of God, people like you worship their own desires! Keep in mind. Sooner or later, everyone will know the real you. Adam. Before the situation gets worse, I would like to talk to you for a while. -Actually-- -What do you want to say, Dad? I saw you chatting with Shah at the graveyard just now. Did he bad-mouth me? Adam, please don't judge him wrongly. He has no malicious intent. He told me that he saw-- What? Dad, he broke into this house once. Is that what you call a good person? And you are asking me not to judge him wrongly? Adam, please let me talk first! If you still want to tell me how good Shah is, forget it. I don't trust that man at all. Perhaps he has something to do with Maria's dad's disappearance. Why would he kidnap Mr. Osman? Do you have proof? Peace be upon you. What? The police have found Mr. Osman? I'm thankful, Ustaz. Maria has told me everything. We already found out who is causing trouble for our family. Fazli is right. Not every religious person can be trusted. Just a few rotten apples, not all. -Don't be so quick to judge. -I'm sorry, Ustaz Adam. There are lots of people out there who do bad things in the name of religion. Who are you talking about? I don't know how to tell you this, but you should go and ask my dad. He is in his bedroom, but his condition has become worse. It's better if you go and see my dad. He wants to see you too. Allow me to go to the room. Mr. Osman. What's all this? You said Mr. Osman was in the bedroom. I couldn't find him. Hadn't the police found him? Ustaz Adam. What are you holding, Ustaz? Ustaz, where are you? Maria was trying to commit suicide. I'm coming back from the hospital. Ustaz, are you listening to me? Ustaz? God, have mercy. My goodness. Help! Open the door! BODY 1 Dear God, lead us away from hypocrisy. Give my son guidance. Show him the right path. Let him know the truth, dear God. Amen, Lord of the worlds. Ustaz. -Wait. -Where's Maria? -Why did she disappear suddenly? -Where are you going? Are you just going to leave? What exactly happened? Do you have any idea who is behind this? I'm sure one of us knows what is going on. I have no idea at all, Ustaz. Things happened one after another. You really have no idea at all? Are you suspecting me? Are you saying that I am the culprit? Then, how can you explain this? I found this when I was looking through your house. Please tell me, whose talisman is this? Apparently, it was you who took it. I thought the late Imam Ali was the one who took it. This talisman is indeed mine. It protects my family. I told you before that I sought help elsewhere. A shaman gave this to me. We should seek protection only from God and not from a shaman giving this kind of talisman. Believing in something other than God is the biggest blasphemy. Don't you know that? God, have mercy on us. Maria? Hello, Maria? Where are you? I can't stand this anymore, Ustaz. You are the only one who can help me. Please save me, Ustaz. I have a secret to tell you. Secret? I'm at the old bungalow in Batu 30, Ulu Kampung. -Please come now, Ustaz. -What's the secret, Maria? Maria? -Peace be upon you, Dad. -And peace be upon you too. Where are you? I want you to come home now. I need to see you. Shah is here with me. What is he doing there? I'm sorry, Dad. I have an emergency. Maria called me just now. She said she's at the old bungalow in Batu 30, Ulu Kampung. -I'm going there right now. -Adam, wait. God, have mercy on us. Maria! Maria! Maria! Ustaz. -Help me, Ustaz. -Maria, what are you doing here? How did you get here? We have to get out of here quickly. Because we seem to have other "visitors" here. I was trying to find a way out, but I couldn't. I couldn't find my way out, Ustaz. Please get me out of here. You couldn't find a way out? It's okay. Come with me. Hurry. I'm sorry, Ustaz. -Actually, I-- -Let's talk outside. What matters now is that we find a way out. We were here just now, weren't we? Did we perhaps walk in circles? -Oh, God! -Ustaz! Oh, God! Oh, God! Help me! Goodness, Maria. Maria! Goodness, Maria. Maria. Say your shahada, Maria. I'm sorry... Say your shahada, Maria. -There is no deity except God. -I'm sorry... Actually... I'm the one who hit your car. -I'm the one who caused your wife's death. -It was you? Why did you do this to me, Maria? Why? What did I ever do to you? Tell me, Maria. I want to know why you did that. -Tell me. -Since... -I... -Who asked you to do this? I'm the one who forced her to hit your car. It was you whom I wanted to get rid of, but surprisingly, you are hard to be killed. What did I do, Mr. Osman? Because you interfered with my job to get rid of believers in the village. I hate people like you. A bunch of hypocrites! You are the one who has been harming the village all this time. Imam Ali was your best friend, you know? -God, have mercy! -I could even kill my own daughter. Why not the others? She suddenly chose to become a faithful person. She would not worship what I worship. That's why she had to die too. How could you kill your own daughter? She didn't reveal your doings because she loved you! You prayed with the villagers at the mosque. And you gave donations too. What was all that? Why? You were crippled before this, right? I thought people like you are all that. Turns out, it was easier to fool people like you. If you want to be rich, marry a young and pretty lady, and live well like I do, -you must worship-- -The cursed Satan! To kill Muslims and become rich with dirty money? It's better to have no money than no conscience, Mr. Osman! Killing Muslims is the deal you made with Satan! This is the biggest hypocrisy! You're a hypocrite! Hell is your place! I summon thee forth O, Zannabur. Come to me, your master who awakened you. Show yourself, Satan! Destroy this believer for me. Show yourself, Satan! I summon thee forth O, Zannabur. Come to your master who awakened you. I seek refuge in God from Satan the outcast. Dear, Satan. In the name of God. Dear, Satan. There is no deity except Him. The Ever-Living, the sustainer of existence. Neither-- Oh, God! Plant those seeds of doubt in your heart, Adam. -Oh, God. -Nobody can help you here. I know you have doubts about God. Show Him your doubts. Listen to the calling of Satan. Listen. Indeed, God is always with me. And He will never fail those who rely solely on Him. He will guide me! I summon thee forth O, Zannabur. Come to your master who awakened you. Show yourself, Satan! Destroy this believer for me. Oh, God! -Show yourself, Satan! -Oh, God! God doesn't care about you! What good has He ever done for you? Take your wife for example. Don't you get it, Adam? God has never accepted your faith. God, help me! He doesn't care about you! He gives nothing in return! There is no might or power except with God! Taste your suffering! Sufficient for us is God, and He is the best Disposer of affairs! Sufficient for us is God, and He is the best Disposer of affairs! Fill your heart with hatred towards me, and also Maria who caused the death of your family! Don't forgive Maria! Tap into the darkness in your heart! If God should aid you, no one can overcome you, -but if He should forsake you, -Damn you, believers! who is there that can aid you after Him? Oh, God. All thanks to You. Indeed we belong to God, and indeed to Him we will return. God has finally answered my prayers, Dad. I know who caused Zulaikha's death. It was Maria. Maria did that. But I chose to forgive her. I decided to forgive her. There's one more thing you need to know, Adam. I wanted to tell you, but it was hard for me to say because the truth might upset you. But today, I need to be honest with you. There's a reason why I broke into your house that day. Actually, I'm the one who asked your dad to come. I wanted him to take a look at you himself. That's why... God knows everything. As long as you don't forgive them, you won't be at peace. If God is willing, once you have forgiven the person who did this, God will guide you. God will open your heart... and your eyes to the truth. I have tried to tell you. But you did not even give me a single chance to tell you that Amir... is gone. Oh, God! Just like Zulaikha. Oh, God! Adam! God, have mercy on us. Dear Almighty God of All-Living and All-Sustaining. I ask for Your boundless blessings to help me. To correct my mistakes. Never for a second leave me alone to my trouble. Lift me off my woes and worries. As a humble servant, I cannot handle them by myself. God, please forgive me. I beg for Your forgiveness with all my heart. Subtitle translation by Kelvin Chan
