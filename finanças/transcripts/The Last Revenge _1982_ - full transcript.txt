There must be no end, no! I must die... He must die and I am to live, yes! My brother, my brother! Your condition is good, my beloved. The closer your body is to the end, the closer we are to the great goal. Everything is arranged. And sweet triumph will be the balm to soothe your wounds once they have done their bloody task! Of six who showed disdain, One witness was left to endeavor. In spite of unbound pain no other would remain. and naught would be gained, no one had imagined this ever. Verily, verily! So mean had one seen mankind never. Not ripe! Not ripe! These things are still not ripe! Give me a sign! Something in return! I will wait no longer! My brother! My beloved! My one and only! My eternal! You've cocooned yourself in my soul with paralyzing thread, even now after your death. Never again shall I hear your voice, nor sense a breath you take! Not a single tear of sorrow shall I shed, nor shall I waver in my resolve. I will put up a monument for you. Yes, the failure that you were in flesh and blood shall be clad in iron and stone. So this is where he lives -- He, mankind is at his command: He, who holds the world in his hands: He, with whom no other can compare: He, his heart he'll never share. Interesting. Yes, interesting. Indeed! You need to know that everything interests me. Not without reason do they call me the Worldly. And you shouldn?t be surprised at meeting me here. You interest me. What did you say? I said that ... Come! So this is the Water Hall. You see, I'm no stranger to your world. You seem to be right. There are things we have in common. Of which kind? You interest me and I will interest you. Oh really? I shall prove it to you. Well then, we'll make it easy and do what stands to reason. And what is that? Play a game. What shall we wager? What we are most afraid of losing. You live on certainty. That is what you are most afraid of losing. So your stake will be certainty. And what do you fear Losing? You must find out... That's not how to play the game. The cards must be kept open. Do you wish to lose your certainty at this early stage? What do you care about the prize if you're certain to win it? Alright. What's the task? I've lost my son. You're the Worldly. Go out into this world and look for the man who will be my heir instead of my son. You shan't be disappointed. You may keep the fish. We shall meet again soon. Quietly he started to commence the fight. in town whence he had parted. But ill fortune would strike, what terrible plight Bad luck! Bad Luck! He overrated his far-sight! Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thousands of people have come here today. Some of them have traveled far, in order to attend this celebratory event. However, our hope to see the donor of this enormous construction himself won't be fulfilled. -- He who keeps the world aghast,; he, whom no one can surpass,; he, whose wealth one can't convey,; he, for whom all is child's play, -- he has chosen not to appear and to let those reminiscent to whom he has dedicated this memorial.; ... ... those who failed. The monument has not been unveiled yet. At its pedestal is engraved the memorable phrase.; ''Many amongst us persevere in life, that long and burdensome trail, ''unflaggingly, n'er a moment of strife, yet many a dream is doomed to fail.'' Have a nice day and be a witness to today's events. Ladies and gentlemen, we don't fear it, we're looking forward to it. There they are --the celebrities, the rich, the important, the possibly suitable people. They certainly have little to show for it. Just looking at them I know that half of them must fail... ... Let's have a Look at the other half! It must be one of these three, but which one? Why of course, it is for them to show me. They must give proof of their capacity, They shall be matched against each other... Being beautiful is simply beautiful. A message for you. Heavenly. Muscles are what gives me power, so I must keep my muscles powerful. A message for you. Goodness gracious! Knowledge is my greatest virtue, Knowledge -- always seeking for the truth. Reason asks the question ''why?'', while the rest of the world goes by. A message for you. Oh, oh, oh. Well. Help, help! double murder! Police! Police! Look for the evidence! Do you want to know how it happened? I'm in the picture. I've seen everything, recognized everything ... Stop! Don't move! Stay where you are! But listen! You need me. Without me, you're ... I'm too smart for this world. What do you think you're doing? Are you crazy? But... it could have become an case of self-defense! He may just as well have been a witness. Yes, but ... Stop it! I'm the one in charge here! Get on with the job! And ask me first next time! What have you got there? Give it to me! Strange! So there were three candidates. And they're all dead now. One was alive and wanted to testify. Very suspect! And who's behind all this? Very mysterious! But my intuition tells me something grand, something is going on here! I'm wandering this world, offering his inheritance: Fortune, wealth and power. But what must I find: Nothing but stupidity, debility and arrogance. He has no heir. No one is worthy. Nobody! Really nobody? Now that I think about it, who is the one factor in this game who has all the traits I've failed to find, to whom they are obvious, who is searching for them, knows them, can distinguish them because they are peculiar to him? Moreover, who is not only capable, but also willing? Anyway, who is it that doesn't need any more evidence, because he's made up his mind already? I am the factor in this game. I am the dark unknown, the person nobody's heard of. It's me! It's not you! A young man once told me: ''For you I'm just right.'' But young man, why should you be? You should see me fight!'' You're nothing special that I can see! Forget it hon', you're not the one! A young man once asked me:, ''Am I not worth a call?'' But young man, why should you be? I am handsomest of all!'' You're nothing special that I can see! Forget it hon', you're not the one! A young man offered me, ''We shall never part!''. But young man, why shouldn?t we? I'm terribly smart!'' You're nothing special that I can see! Forget it hon', you're not the one! Then a young man came to me and we started hugging. Suddenly I'm full of glee! Of course, I'm very cunning!'' You're something special, that I can see! It's you that I like hugging, 'cause you're so very cunning. ..'cause you're so cunning, 'cause you're so cunning? I must have forgotten something, there's something I failed to consider. I feel there's danger ahead. The cunning man... I've got to find him. He must be somewhere! But where? Ha! I got you! You're too late. AII is mine now! That cunning of yours won't do you a bit of good! Careful, my friend! You don't know whom you're up against. Silence! I do the talking here! So you already know what the issue is, and you refuse to give up? AII the better then! We shall let deeds decide! I'II give you one day! At exactly the same time tomorrow, we shall compete at the Square of Debates! As you wish! Who is he? What is he? I must find out... One day! His weak points, I have to find his weak points. Sparse are my findings, but great is the moment. The greatest moment in my life. I must be victorious! Ladies and gentlemen! Your suspension will be worth its while. Your expectations will be exceeded. You will be witness to a unique event. He, the world at his command: He is mightiest in all the land: He who's accomplished every feat: He, there's no one could compete: Yes, He! ... Not one of you can possibly fathom how great a burden will be carried by the man destined to be his successor, his heir?. This heir, yes, his successor, will be found and put to test here! You be the judge. Will the man before you not succumb to the burden of this legacy? The trial that I subject him to and which he has to pass, shall verily be most difficult! My dear friend, I am delighted to hear such an honorable man speak so highly of me. Thank you! Thank you very kindly! What's wrong? You don't have to be embarrassed: that's very decent of you! He is a decent man, isn't he? Or are you not decent after all? You refuse to answer?. Ladies and gentlemen, you will be puzzled at the strange behavior of this man. And I cannot, I must not, keep to myself any longer the atrocities behind this behavior. Not only did he stain his conscience with the blood of three promising young man, not only did he use the innocence of our children as a means towards his sombre schemes. No indeed! Violence and murder do not satisfy this man! He appears to be a humble servant, yet his righteousness is but an act, his talk is double talk, his deeds are deceiving. And he will not be satisfied until he has assumed the Legacy, by whatever malicious means he deems necessary! So he claws and mutilates and chews on that wonderful fruit, which must be handled and preserved with such humility and care once it has blossomed and ripened! I call the arm of the law! Seize this man! Surrender! You're under arrest! No! This is not true! This is a swindle! With every step he takes, descending to the dungeon. grows the expert's hate! Ruler beware, all's too Late! Nemesis shall be your fate Despite your fortune near the condemned one! We?ll have you at our mercy in a few hours. You can bet your bottom dollar on that! The hour of retribution is near. Everything is a question of time. Time is short ... ... but time will tell. You've had your fun. It's sleeping time! Sleeping time! Silence! Come here! Come here! Won't you? Marvelous, marvelous! Beautiful, isn't it? What is it? Whose is it? Is it he! Is it his? A subterranean factory! My creation! Nothing is impossible to me! You created all this, and yet it belongs to someone else. How can you bear the thought? Exactly! How unfair! The two of is, couldn?t we? Kill? Easy. Safe. Isn't it? Away! Away! Cover up the evidence, or not? We've made it, haven't we? He's dead. The experiment can begin. It was too easy. It can't be that easy. I must get back. Well, how did I do it? Well done, isn't it? Good job! No! It's not true. Young friend, you've accomplished something great. I will pardon your rashness which, due to my maneuvering, has borne fruit. Let me assure you, you've achieved your goal: You've killed me! But I had anticipated your imprudence. Just as you disposed of those that may have hindered me, you have now eliminated the last obstacle in my way. You've created what you wished to destroy! You thought this would be the end, instead it is the beginning. Death has become Life, time has become eternity. When death hath overcome them all, as they rot and stink repulsively, t'is I who'll stand forever tall, never to perish, divinity! Farewell my fine friend. You have served your purpose. You have played your role! I shall now leave you to your fate. Yes, immortal. Immortal. Experiment successful. I've worked on it for ages. Success! Success! Stop! What's this? What ... What's going on here? What are you doing down here? Get moving, back to your cell! This not funny! Who are you anyway? I know everything. Come, come. I know everything. You stay here! Revenge! In this prison we must stay, work is all we know. Do the same thing every day, no place we can go. Hack, hack, on and on! Hack, hack, hope is gone. Dynamite! What? I'm going to get a confession from you now. A confession! Black on white. The whole thing one more time. Prisoners, I'm here to set you free! Comrades! Here! Sign this! Stay here until I come to get you. You are an important witness. I'm an important man now. Everybody needs me, don't they? Just you wait! Just you wait! In prison we were forced to stay, work was all we knew. Did the same thing every day, now our dream?s come true! For as you see, he's set us free! Revenge it will be dire! We'll set this house on fire! Finally! I got hold of him, the wirepuller. What are you talking about? I thought it's this ... No, it's not him! Look! I see, the confession. Where is he now? Not here. Yes, but ... He's dead. Lieutenant ... He's dead, but he's immortal. I don't understand a word. If he is immortal ... Yes, that's what he is. ... then our hands are tied. No, they are not. The Law doesn't provide for such a situation. I don't care! What am I talking about? Isn't this utter nonsense? Nonsense! Nonsense! You are confusing me. Now you listen! No, I won't Listen! I'm going to put this man behind bars. even if it is the Last thing I do! May I now? I don't appear that often. You don't see me quite much. Still, I am overall, so it's going to be fatal. Quick, quick! Now the charges on levels five, seven, and nine. AII contacts to the electrification unit. Watch carefully! For it is he! The victor forever formerly! Now you'll see, t'was not to be! How clever! Thus I gaze from lofty height, upon my vast creation: t'is knowledge of unbound might this divine sensation. Naught left to achieve, my work is done. Yet there's foreboding of conspiracy to destroy all I have won. Sometimes I feel Like I, the master, am the slave of the vigilance towards my enemies. Now that I am superhuman, the petty impulses of the humans seem even meaner to me. Father! Come up here father. I wish to talk to you. Go away! You no Longer exist! I can see you're scared. I can see through you. Come here! You wicked apparition, vanish! Now, father which you don't want to be, a new era begins. The plans that you worked out, the facts that you created: they're playing games with you behind your back. So finial, irreversible as your goal demands. If you want to go as far, you mustn't ignore anything. Otherwise, you will stumble and fall. And your fall will be as cruel, as unimaginably terrible as no death can ever be. Your hour has come, my father. Be prepared! Triumph! Your pain shall endure forever, just as your body is endowed with eternal Life. My master! My master! Where is my master? Come! Come! Though it's dawn already you have not returned. You must have been successful. You must have been successful. If I had the means I would start a dragnet operation Like the world has never seen one. But because they won't believe me I have to wait here until I'm blue in the face. He's back. He's back! At Last! My master! My master! Our precious love he did condemn. Yet should we give up all we've got? Of course not! Thus, we were mean to him! Unworthy' was what we were called. Can only discipline be taught? Of course not! Thus, his power we have stalled! Though refused the Legacy, Should we Leave the fruit or not? Of course not! Thus, his plight shall Last eternally! Thus, his plight shall Last eternally! Stop! Don't move! Incredible! The perfect crime. And yet you've overlooked one factor: Me! I'm the person nobody believes, but I'm going to settle this matter. Do you hear me?! Do you hear me?! There's no way that could have become self-defense. Today is the 111th day. Yesyesyesyes. The number is promising. The signs are casting their shadows. Yes! The time is right! Yes, I'm coming. Ready in a moment! An experiment! Did there used to lie a stone? A slime? A slime? What slime? Look! Look! Heareth each and every soul earth rumble with contempt.
