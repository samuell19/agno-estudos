You come to Shibuya often? It wasn't my plan today. I had an urge to get off the train here. I surprised myself. I don't come here a Iot. Oh Yeah? What a coincidence, then. Are you in college? Around 20 years old? I'm 22. l have a deskjob at a small construction company. You have a job already? You live alone? With my family. Mom and dad? With my mother. Just your mom? What about your dad? Only my mother. Just us two. What do you do on yourdays off?. Your hobbies? Hobbies? l read books. l also take walks in parks. What was it like your first time? I went to a mixer party when I was in junior college. I got drunk. A guy took care of me and... we ended up in a hotel. And he did you, huh? Here. Do you have a dream? For the future? A dream... I've never thought about it. Are you enjoying life? Don't you want to change? You can turn your life into whatever you want it to be. Wouldn't it be fun if you could become someone else? Namae no Nai Onnatachi ('Nameless Women') aka 'Love & Loathing & Lulu & Ayano' Cut! That was good. Will you go on standby? - Next is a fuck scene? - Yes. I have a craving for strawberries. Come in. Excuse me. I'm Lulu Sakurazawa. This is my first shoot. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Go take a shower. - I had one at home. - Ok, then. Change into these. Take a seat. Hurry up and get changed. - Here? - Of course. The shooting sequence changed. You have to stand by now. I thought we had more time. I bet it was Rie again. She's so selfish. Please hurry! Come in. Is everyone here? Let me check something... Let's see... Ami is the class president. Ayano... you're a ko-gal. What's your name? - Lulu Sakurazawa... - You're so dull! You like anime? Anime? Right: you're an anime and costume-play otaku. Good luck! Take your coat off. Sit there. - I'm done. - Nice work. Take off your glasses. Hold the front. You're set to go. After that, you end up here. Got that? I don't hear you. Good. Let's roll 'em. Cameras rolling! Ready... Action! What do you want?! - This is against school rules! - Stop it! What are you doing?! Don't be such a baby! You're on the job! Don't be a pain. Just get up and do it. All right? Let's continue the scene. Take your places. Everyone ready? Cameras rolling. Ready? Action! Resist him! More! I have to go to Comic Market! Keep going! I'm going to punish you! I have to go to Comic Market! We're finished. Lulu... Lulu! - Sorry... - You OK? You were good. I liked it. You have a unique quality... Really? Good luck next time, too. Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. What are you gonna do from now on? You gonna keep this job or quit? I think I might do another one. You might? Make up your mind. I'm sorry. I'll do it. Then don't ever act that way again. I'm sorry. I get embarrassed when a girl like you is from the same agency. We have the same agent? So what? Is that a problem? No. It'd be nice if you could teach me things. Why would I? You get on my nerves! Junko? Yes. I'm home. Where were you? Sorry... I was at the library. Where's my black skirt? Didn't you go to the cleaner's? I put it in the closet. Well, it's not there! Sorry... I'll go look for it. Hurry! I have to rush. I feel lonely... I miss you. I'm serious! You're a real man. Don't tell my other customers. You're special. Miss Ogura... perfect timing. - What? - Will you go to the post office? Okay... Then I'll take these. Here you go. - For you. - You're so sweet. - This one's for you. - Thanks. I did the final estimates for that project. - Oh yeah? You did a good job. - Really? Hello? Lulu, you have a newjob. You free this weekend? Yes. The director the other day really liked you. From now on, I'll promote you as an otaku character. By the way, what otaku are you? Shall I get that in your size? - You can try it on. - That's OK. Never mind! I'll get that. This is super-popular, and it's our last one. I shall make your wish come true. Turn into the top idol of Akihabara! Turn into porn actress Lulu Sakurazawa! Don't... I have to go to Comic Market! I'm going to punish you! Fan letter? To Lulu? Supporting-actresses rarely get fan letters. Keep up the good work. Yes! ''Lulu, you are so cute and are the best... ''You give me moral support.'' Mr. Miyake, thanks for your letter! Lulu is super-happy! You better keep your promise... I'm looking forward to tomorrow. Good night. You're home. The bath is ready. Wait. You're gone a lot these weekends. Is there a guy? I'm kidding. No man would give you the time of day. That's not true! What? - Are you talking back to me? - I'm sorry. You just keep quiet, and do as I say! I'm gonna punish you. Son of a bitch! I said, no! I told you: no anal! Who said it was OK?! But... Director! I didn't say anything. Hold it! I shall make your wish come true. Huh?! I'm magical girl Kururun. Nice to meet you. Hey... get the first-aid kit. - You better stay away from Ayano when she's pissed off. - Why? She was the leader of a women's motorcycle gang. When she snapped, she became dangerous. Once, she put a light bulb up a girl's you-know-where, and stepped on her. She was out of control, and spent time in juvie. You... Good work. Good work. Come with me. Umm... For me? Gargle and kill germs after a shoot. And take fluids after you puke. Thank you. I don't wanna owe you. Now we're even. Owe me? For earlier. This was my fault. It's just a scratch. See? I'm fine. Why do you... take on a weird character during a shoot? You were different before. Why pretend to be an otaku? I'm not pretending. Lulu's a real otaku! So phony... Stop being a freak. I'm Lulu Sakurazawa. Lulu loves anime and dressing up in costumes! I always go to Comic Market, too! I wasted my time. - Wait! Don't tell anyone! - Huh? Lulu has to be a real anime otaku. What do you mean? Don't tell anyone! You felt sick and were puking. But this is all I have! Please! Let go of me! Please don't tell anybody! Please! Please don't tell anybody. I beg you. Please... Please... Okay. Don't worry. I won't betray you. Thank you. I'm home. Yuya? You're not home? Again... 'Maiko' Hold your temper... I like super-fat and filthy guys. Hairy legs get me soooo excited! Starring role? Lulu?! Not for certain yet. There's another candidate. Depending on how you do, DOS will give you an exclusive contract. - It's good news. - ''Exclusive contract''... Supporting-actresses rarely get starring roles. Who's the other candidate? Ami Mizutani! She started out like you. She's getting popular, 'coz she'll do anything from anal to S&M. Girls willing to do extreme acts go far. ''Go far''? Yeah... DOS specialises in hardcore porn. She may have the advantage. I think you'll get the part, if you try hard enough. But you shouldn't push yourseIf... Mr. President, Lulu will do anal! Really?! I'll let them know that. Oh, look: you got more letters. Don't let these fans down. - Let me go! - Stay still! Don't... No... 'Lulu Sakurazawa is the best!' 'Lulu is the icon of porn actresses.' 'Lulu doesn't make me hard! My fave is Ami Mizutani!' 'You guys know nothing. I'll kill you all!!!' I'm home. Where were you? Another stray? We have milk, right? You're dirty. He was muddy and crying. You want some milk? Just a minute, OK? I'll give him away tomorrow. Just for tonight. So please, Ayano... I told you not to call me Ayano. Sorry... Please, Yoko. You have a soft spot for them. I can't help it... - Dogs, cats... I can't ignore them. - Women, too. - Huh? Nothing. - I want a car. - A car? So I can drive you to work... and we can go out of town on weekends. There's a nice new American model... Don't be stupid; we can't afford a car right now. So I was thinking you could work in a sex shop. A high-end brothel. My friend runs it, so it's safe. Porn actresses can make lots of money there. Think about it. She'll be finished soon. Don't worry. Please. An advance? Please! I thought you got a job at a sex shop. - Hello! - Hi, Lulu! - Hello. You got that starring role. Oh my God! Really?! After you finish the shooting, there'll be a handshake event on the release date. - ''Handshake event''? - You're gonna be busy. Good for you. - You're gonna be a star. - A star? Star! An excIusive contract will give me more jobs and higher pay. And a handshake event... I feel like a celebrity! You're an idiot. Lulu is your creation, a phony. Not the real you. But Lulu is me! I'm saying you're a fake. Don't get mixed up. You think you're popular? It's not you they like. You're dispensable. They're just using you. You need a disguise to do porn. How pathetic. - What are you doing?! - What do you know?! - You picking a fight? - I wanna go far, too! Only in your dreams, idiot! What? That's a punch? What? What? What? What? Harder. Harder! Clench harder! Think of someone you hate. Thrust it with all your might into his gut. You can do it. I'm the opposite. Me, I go like this... I tell myself not to snap, not to fight. Why? If I snap, it's over. But I wanna cry out sometimes. Cry out and lose control. Go somewhere faraway. Whatever. Nice... That smile. - Very nice! - I'm getting nervous! - Do my scene first. - We can't. Why not? I'm tired. Shoot me first. It's not my call. Um... Lulu doesn't mind. Don't worry about it. You're the star. Rie, go wait outside. Now. - Ready for action? - Yes. Lulu... Good luck. Lulu will try hard! Ready? Action! Yes! Wave to the camera. Lie on your back. Spread your arms. Yes, like that! Smile. Good, Lulu. Nice... Why the hell am I the side-act today? You said you wouldn't undersell me. I'm the supporting-actress? What...? Nobody told me that! Forget it! Stay out of the way. Not your turn yet. Asshole! ''Congratulations on your starring role, Lulu. ''You look cute in glasses, but... ''you should quit the office, and do more porn. ''I'm watching over you.'' What is this...? Lulu likes fat, filthy, ugly guys! And... I masturbate every day! I'm so embarrassed! I lost my virginity to a fat otaku. He forced himself on me in a park. Then he came in three seconds! Talk more normally. You're overdoing your character. Lulu is being normal. Come on... Lulu isn't making this up. Yeah, yeah... whatever you want. Are you looking down on porn actresses? Being a porn actress is a fine job. You're on a roll. But be careful. You could end up like Ami. ''Like Ami''? Some guy slashed her face with a knife on the street. That's why you got the starring role. 'Dear Lulu, now it's your turn... 'to make my wish come true.' 'To Lulu Sakurazawa' Lulu... It's me. Why are you still here? Those clothes don't suit you. What are you talking about? Please leave. Miss Ogura, who is he? Don't worry - you can use mine. Use this and become Lulu again. I used a hair-growth formula to get hairy legs. Aren't you excited? Stop... That Ami Mizutani chick was so funny. Her face was all bloody and she was scared stiff. You should've seen her, Lulu! Stop... - Hey... - Don't touch me! Lulu! Stop it! I came to save Lulu! Let me go! No! I'm not Lulu! I'm... You okay? Huh... what's this? 'Lulu Sakurazawa'? - Porn? - No way! Is this Miss Ogura? - Oh, wow! - It's her. - Unbelievable! Seriously? Yeah... this is you, isn't it? No! It's okay... You smell so nice. I feel horny! - That tickles... she'll hear us. - She's already asleep. What are you doing? Dad bought this for me. Trying to be sexy? - You're just a kid! - Don't! You slut! What do you want? Go away! Mother, look... - What's that outfit? - I'm a porn actress. I go by 'Lulu Sakurazawa', and I'm really popular. Everybody watches me. Everybody wants me. Isn't it amazing? Stupid girl! I'm not a good-for-nothing, not lousy and useless. Go away, I don't wanna see your face! What kind of daughter did you want me to be? I'm your daughter. That's right. You gave birth to me. Stop it. If you were someone decent, Dad wouldn't have left. - Not true. - You said he had cancer... She's crazy and she's lying. He left because of you! You're being fooled by her. She'll use you and then dump you. Stop it! You fawn on men and lie to them. A pathetic woman, who needs a disguise. Shut your mouth! What do you know?! - Stop... - Know-it-all little brat! You lying bitch! I'm never gonna be like you. You are so clueless. Remember the day I got my period? Oh, please... You looked at me like I was filthy. You couldn't forgive me for being a girl. What kind of mother are you? I didn't become a mother by choice! I hate you... I hate you... I hate you... Stop it! Are you okay? Goodbye. You okay? Don't touch me. But... Leave. Leave now! Thank you for everything. - Ask how much she charges. - You ask her. Hey, knock it off. What's wrong with being a porn actress? You all work for a living. Me too. I'm selling whatever I can. Miss Ogura... what happened? - There must be a reason. - A reason? Mr. Asano, I had a crush on you. It doesn't matter now. Fools... you're all fools! Just this once. I know. Did you hear? Rie Aoki committed suicide. Rie... That Rie? Yeah. She ran out of a set and jumped off the building. - Why? - Who knows? She got a bad beating during a rape shoot, but it happens a lot. - She took the job? - Poor girl... She fell all the way down, both figuratively and literally. Hello? Thanks for calling. The Ultimate Rape series? I have just the girl for you: Lulu Sakurazawa. Yes, the anime otaku. She'll do anything. Do what you want with her. You bastard! We realise what we're doing. We got our feet stuck in muck and can't pull ourselves out. But still, we're not things! We're alive! Hello, this is Lulu. It's me, Ayano. Quit the agency right away. The president sold you out to a rape flick. Don't take the next job, no matter what he says. Are you listening? I'll do it. Huh? I'm Lulu Sakurazawa. If it's a job, I'll take it. It's Lulu's job. It's a rapejob. They'll tear you apart. It's okay. I'll do anything. Fine. Suit yourself. Damn idiots. That was close... Hello? Hi, Lulu. You have a job this weekend. What's wrong? What kind of job? The usual... Don't worry, you'll breeze through it. All right. What? The newjob... I got the offer... You're taking it, right? Idiot! He treated me to lunch for bumping into me. That's how he recruited you? So typical. You totally fell for it. He said I could turn my life into whatever I want it to be. I was so moved. He said he knew instinctively... that it'd be the perfect job for me, and he said... ''Wouldn't it be fun if you could become someone else?'' How did you know?! You okay? That's him. So he's... your... Unbelievable! You're an idiot for believing a guy Iike him. But you're the one living with the idiot. Sorry. When I met Yuya, I was really depressed. A girl who I thought was a friend said she was scared of me. She was always afraid that I'd beat her up next. I was the only one who thought we were friends. Yuya's fine with those things. My past freaks him out, but he doesn't judge me. He accepts me as I am. I knew he just wanted money. But he's your boyfriend. He hasn't come home in days, and might never. Ayano... Ayano? You okay? Drink too much? Are you pregnant or something? No... Really? Whose is it? Yuya's... I think. - But how many jobs... - It's Yuya's! I can tell. You're having it? No! You can't! You have to... Get an abortion? I don't want to kill it. - What...? - No. Somewhere unfamiliar and faraway... You said you wanted to go. Have the baby there. I'll go with you. I'll go with you, okay? Let's go somewhere faraway and start our lives over. Are you drunk or what? I'm still hollow inside. Being in porn was fun at first... There were bad things too, but... it was fun, because I didn't feeI like myself. But nothing has changed. I'm still hollow. Ayano... we can turn our lives into whatever we want them to be. That's Yuya's line. Who cares? - So where should we go? - You decide. A tropical island. Hawaii, maybe. No. Too many Japanese. - Bali? Fiji? - Where's that? Pacific Ocean...? Can you speak English? Then Enoshima. Enoshima? - Too close, huh? - So local, all of a sudden! - But I wanna go. - To Enoshima? No! Somewhere faraway. Then... let's go! - And your boyfriend? - Forget him! A tropical island! Hawaii! Beach... beach... I'll buy swimwear! Just wear school swimwear. No... I wanna wear a bikini. Take this! Hey! Ouch... it's your fault! Take it off! I'll get you back! You win! Congrats! 'I'm going on a miracle mission. Those who ridiculed me... 'will see how strong I am.' 'I'm going to climb the stairway to heaven with Lulu.' 10 o'clock?. Okay, later. 'To Yuya, I'm going on a trip. 'Thanks for everything. Goodbye, Yoko.' Yuya? I'm... sorry for not coming home. Did something happen? I'm in trouble. I was such a fool. What's going on? Yuya, where are you? Ayano? What's wrong? Where are you? Lulu... sorry... I can't go. There's no money in here. Stay away from my woman. - Don't mess with the yakuza. - Stop this bullshit! Run. You bitch! The baby... Baby? - Stay there. - Be quiet! Bastard! Run, Yoko! Fuck you! Hurry! No! Let me go! Do it. Yes... good. More! Keep your hands off Lulu! - What are you doing?! - What? Stay away! I'll kill you all. This is bad... Lulu, everything's fine. You're grateful to me, huh? Forget it. I'll do anything for you. You're the only one who understands the real me. Me too... I'm the only one who understands the real Lulu. What do you mean, ''the real Lulu''? Lulu is... a goddess. You don't make sense. The real me is a costume-play porn actress? Dominated by my mother for 22 years... The helpless Junko Ogura is me but not me? Then who are you? The real you. I'm... The real me... I'm not like this. I'm not dumb or timid. I'm not an insect. But why does everyone make fun of me? Why me all the time? This is a miracle... The stairway to heaven... To heaven... to heaven... They're all the real you. Timid... dumb... They're all you. I'm... Junko Ogura and Lulu Sakurazawa. Hey... wait up. Are you enjoying life? Don't you want a new life? It's no fun, but that's life. What do you mean, ''change myself'? I'm having a blast. Is that a problem? Don't you wonder if this is what you want? Yeah, I do. Recruiting for porn, right? No thanks. Is this what I want...? Of course not! - Do you have a dream? - A dream? You're so pretty. Don't you wanna be on TV? - I... - A little bit, huh? You can turn your life into whatever you want it to be. You have to grab the chance. I assure you: you can do it. It's perfect for you. - Really? - Really. Come with me. Where did she go? 'Quintuple murder on porn set, killer to be sentenced tomorrow' Mr. Tanaka? It's been so long. That's not why I'm calling. I feel lonely. I miss you.
