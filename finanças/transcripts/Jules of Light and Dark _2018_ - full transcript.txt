Are these like that? What? It's pretty off. Uh-huh. Hey! - Hey, how are you? - There you are. Howdy. Hey, have a seat. That's stupid. I see you all the time. You know, I'm going to be in your fields next week. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - Bill's? - Yeah. All right, I'll keep an eye out for you. Yeah. You wanna get a drink? Nah, not tonight. How about lunch next week? Yeah, sounds good. Yeah. Hey, man, I've gotta head out but, um, I'll see you around, alright? Shut up. Another one? Yes, please. Pop the trunk! You hungry? Ooh, I like your lips! Thank you! After school, you're gonna be great. Probably get hired at some cool tech company or something. I can't. Why would I even work at a tech company? I don't know anything about that stuff - at all. No, Jules, you haven't even started yet. You could come live with me. Maya, you need to finish your classes and graduate. I will be fine. I will be good. I will figure it out. Thank you for being such a good friend. Is there a piece of paper when you open up the bag? Like, the instructions or something? Hey, guys! I don't know. Hi! I didn't remember you guys were coming here. So early. Good to see you, dude. What's going on? Good to see you. Wouldn't miss it. I didn't know you guys were bringing a tent. Yeah, it's my dad's old tent. My mom found it in the garage. Looks great. This is like the perfect set. Yeah! When are you gonna get started? I don't know. We're waiting for some more people to get here. Do you think he'll take off anything more? Eww, no. Maybe! He must be high out of his mind. It's way too cold. I bet he stays by that fire all night. If he's smart he will. He's gonna freeze otherwise. He took, like, four Mollys. No! That's really dangerous. Greedy! Greedy. Yeah. Our Molly guy didn't show up, so... Yeah, no that's him. He's the Molly guy. You gotta get it from him somehow, before he takes them all. So last rave of the year. Hmm. It's the best one this year, I think. I'm gonna go back in the barn. Do you want to come? Yeah. I wanna hang out here for a little. I think I'm gonna head back too. You ok? She's just never been with a guy before. I'm sorry. I can't. Hey! Shit. Hey. Are you keeping pressure on that? Keep your hand tight on that. Well, you're looking well. A lot better than the last time I saw you. Do you need some juice or water? No, thank you. Let me know if you need anything. Just use this, ok? Hey, is your girlfriend ok? Oh, you probably... You probably don't remember, but you and I talked all the way to the hospital. You know, you slept for a little bit, but we talked. Oh. Um, what did I say? You talked about dropping out of school so you guys could be together. You were worried. You told her you loved her. I'm Freddy, by the way, if you don't remember. She's not, uh, doing too well, I don't think. It's not your fault. You know, that corner, it comes out of nowhere. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. You have nothing to be sorry about. You're a little bit like my daughter. When she was little, once, she skinned her knee and she kept apologizing for it. Oh, I'm sorry. Don't say that! Don't be sorry about anything. Don't ever be sorry. How old's your daughter? I - probably... Twenties, probably, now... Maybe? Do you have any other kids? Yeah, I have a son and a daughter. What about you? Where's your family? I don't know. They sent me a box of stuff. We're not really talking right now. Ah, I got it. I think I know how they feel. I don't talk to my kids either. Why not? It's just been so long, I forgot. My mom doesn't like what I was doing with Jules. I got it. Oh, I forgot. I've got, um... When I was cleaning my truck I found that phone. It's either you or Jules'. There's a picture of you guys and a kitty. Thank you! Well, I'd better get to work. But I'd like to see you again, or stay in touch or something. Yeah. I wanna know how you're doing. Yeah. - Ok? - Uh-huh. Alright, I'll see you later. Identify the object you see on the card. - Guitar. - Good. Arm chair? Or chair? Just chair. Good. Ear. Yeah. Do you need what time it is, or just - - Just the object. - It's a clock. Good. Sandwich. Ear. Sandwich. I got a little bit of a sandwich left - do you think he'll want it? - That'll be great. - Yeah? Yeah, he'll like that. There you go. Such a good boy. Yeah. He's a chicken salad fan. It's like he was hungry! Now, he really got bit by a rattlesnake? Yeah. How? Where was that? Just by my house. You can see a white mark up here... Hello? H-hello? Who is this? It's, uh, it's... Andrea? Yeah. Hello? Oh, my god. Ok, so follow the pen with your eyes but don't move your head. Ok, good. Ok, so how are you feeling? - Good. - Good? Uh-huh. Well, I'm going to put in a recommendation that you be released this week. It's weird. I can't write. I can write, but... Your letters are wrong. Yeah. Are they going to let you go home yet? Yeah. That's good. I need to go to a specialist. Yeah, you told me that. Oh, yeah. Hey... This is a good idea. No. No! I know. I know, but we have to! I know. But it's good, though. Argh, I wasn't even... Maya, no! I wasn't even ready. Here we go. Let me see. Oh, my god. No! Ugh. Wait, there's gotta be... Oh, so cute! You got any big plans tonight? It's so weird. I was, like, thinking about it, but it doesn't come out. Are you going to see a physical therapist? I think so. There's that course at the pool. We should do it together. Yeah. Can David come too? No. It's just girls. Aw, you're no fun. No, that's the rules. My mom said I might need to come home for a while after this. When did she say that? - Ready to go? - Yeah. - Do you want this? - No. - Last chance. - No! Let's go. Oh, for me? What's that? It's our house key. They took mine away when I told them about Jules. That's a good thing, though, right? Not really. They said I could have it back when it was over. At least they're still supporting you. Hey, buddy. Is your mom there? Mom! - Who is it, honey? - I don't know. Andrea? Hey, please open the door. How about... Can I just have five minutes? I came a long way. Andrea... Are those your kids? Do you talk to Marco? You don't get to ask me that. I brought... I brought you this. I wish it was more. I'm gonna give you more. Why are you here? You can finish your cigarette. There's a gate over there. You can let yourself out. Hey, Maya. How are you? My mom says hi. Cool. Tell her I said 'hi' too. Let me go find someplace quiet to talk. What's up? They let you out? That's great! Yeah, I guess so. Sorry I didn't text you to let you know. It's been kind of hectic around here. My mom is taking me out of school for the rest of the semester. I don't know why. I mean, I do, but I think they're all overreacting. They just want you to feel better. I am feeling better. That's what's frustrating. Anyways... My mom wants me to get off the phone. Ok. Well, can I come see you? Yeah, any time. Oh, this is not nice. You gotta throw up. I just... Don't be by me. I'm not going to leave you in here by yourself. I don't think... I don't care. You should've left me at home by myself. Jules, it's... Everyone is looking at me like I'm fucked up. Do you get that? I'm... I think they're happy to see you. I'm embarrassed. I'm proud of you. You have a lot of cats. We do, and they all need homes. Hi. These guys are great. Uh-huh. I love this one. Hello. Hi. Hi. I don't know whether I want a cat or a dog or... I can show you the dogs. Was that a cat? Hey. Maybe a cat. Yeow! Wow. Let's... Can we see the dogs? - Yeah, definitely. - Yeah. Hey, baby. Hello. That one is beautiful. She's very beautiful. Very calm Yeah. Hey, puppy dog. Hey. I can't, I can't take it. - Yeah, it's hard. - I want all of them. I know. Hey. - I'll take this one. - Ok. C'mon! Can you jump up in there? Oh, good boy! Hey! Hello. Hey. This is my truck, and it is a good truck. Hello. You and I are going to go all kinds of places in this thing. I'm Anne. Hi, Anne, nice to meet you. I'm Maya. Maya, nice to meet you! - Hi. - Jules. Jules, nice to meet you! - Barbara. - Barbara, nice to meet you. Thanks for having us today. - Cold water. - It's warming up. Try and go really high out of the water. Do you wanna go off the diving board? Your mom's gonna be here in a little bit, but we can have some fun before then. You can hang out here if you want, but I'm gonna do it. Jules, what gives? You haven't talked to me all day. What happened? I don't know. Didn't you like it? Yeah, of course. I don't feel right. I do normal things, and I don't feel right. - It's ok. I've got you. - No, you don't! I just need to be done for today. I am so sorry, Maya. I know that you thought that we were going to be together, but we're not. I don't even think I'm gay. I... I just have a lot of other things that I need to deal with right now. I gotta go. I'll talk to you later? Hey! There you are. Hey! What's a chemical synthesis? Anabolism? What do you call a polymer formed by condensation synthesis? C'mon, I'm not gonna do your homework. You have it right there. Polysaccharide. You ok? You don't want me to finish this up for you? No, I'm almost done. Hey, come on. I've got something for your dorm room. I'm hurrying up, ok? How does it work? Like, I get how on a computer you're playing a song off of a file, but how does it work on a record? How does music come out? You serious? Yeah! It doesn't make any sense. I mean, did you ever have a music box as a kid? Um... Well, the needle is made of a very, very small diamond. There's a diamond? Yeah. And, um... There's these really tiny grooves... ...that it drags along, and as it drags along it creates these vibrations, or sound waves, and it travels up the arm to an electronic sensor, which then sends it to a speaker. And that's essentially how it works. Yeah, that makes sense, 'cause I know it would spiral all the way to the end. Yeah. And hopefully what you hear is sublime. Or, not the band, but you know. Got it. Or it makes you move. I don't wanna freak you out or anything, but... I have to tell you that I like you. I mean, I don't wanna change anything, because I like hanging out with you. You know, I like that we're friends. But, yeah. How long have you felt this way? Not long. This is pretty new. I'm gay. Wait. I mean, I kinda figured, but you're like all the way? Yeah. Yeah. I probably shouldn't have brought that up. - So it's fine? - Yeah. I mean... Sorry. Uh. So, give me your hand. Like this? You've done this before, right? Yeah, but... Like that? I don't like that. I don't like feeling it. Oh... Yeah. It takes me out of it. Sorry. Can you go faster? Thanks. It feels really good. Um, what do you want me to do? Can I fuck you? Nah, it's all good. I can make myself cum. Is that alright? Yeah. Is that? Is that, um...? You have a shower, right? Do you need a towel? Yeah. There's a dude over there just gave me the thumbs up. He thinks I'm on a hot date with a young girl. I figured they'd think you were my daughter. I saw her. I saw her last week. It felt so good. That's amazing! Yeah. I mean, we'll see where it goes, but it's a step. I brought my dog to play with my grandkids. How many kids does she have? I don't - two or three. I mean, I wasn't there very long. But I'm just really proud of her. I'm gonna go back next week. - Yeah! - So we'll see, but that's... It's a step. How about you? How's Jules? Uh, she's ok. Um... She's staying with her mom. Well, that's good, right? Um, we started a water therapy class. That's probably great for both of you, right? Yeah. What do you do? I work the pumpjacks. Oil derricks. Whoa! How is that? It's good. Business is really good. What about school. What are you studying? I haven't decided yet. I'm trying to figure that out right now. I'm actually thinking about not doing classes next semester and just going on a trip instead. Um, 'cause it feels so weird going back to normal. Because it isn't. Well, you don't have to go back. Yeah, take some time. Get your bearings. This is boring advice, but you ought to think about something stable, like nursing, becoming a nurse. The life just went out of your eyes. That's pretty fucking boring. What about you? Do you have a girlfriend? You know what... I don't know what I'm talking about. Don't worry about it. Cheers. Cheers. Do you wanna do a shot? Oh, fuck yes. Yes. Yeah, hello. Hello. She's a good girl. Yeah, yeah. What a good doggie. I'm gonna text Luis. - What's up? - What's up, man? How you doin'? Hey, Maya. No Jules? No. It's nice to see you, too, though. So sad. Good to see you! Let's get rid of that stuff. C'mon, guys. Excuse me. Alright, guys. You can set your stuff over there. I'll let y'all get settled up. I'll go grab some drinks. See y'all soon. We'll blow that air mattress up later. It's more better. Do you think there's a safe place for my backpack? Um, probably underneath the mattress over there. I think I'm just gonna wear it. Do you live here? I live a couple blocks away. Do you wanna get out of here? Yeah. I... I have some bad news. What? I live with my parents, so I don't have anywhere for us to go. What about you? I have an idea, though. - Cheers. - Cheers. So, how are the boys at Bill's? I don't want to talk about work. Aw, c'mon. I wanna know. I mean, you look tired. No, I feel blessed. I feel healthy. Yeah? Yeah! I've been working out. Yeah, right. I'm serious. Feel my leg. - What? - Squeeze it. Right? Sure. I can run over a mile now. It works. It does. You know what... I got a new dog. And I saw my daughter. Aw, no shit! Well, that's good. That's really great! Yeah, it's really good. You know what - you want another? Yeah. Can we get some more? We got something to celebrate. Yeah! Alright, c'mon. Let's go. I wanna take a look... Let's go. No, no, no. Let me take you home. C'mon. C'mon. C'mon, c'mon. - This way. - Alright. And no way I'm letting you drive. I know it. Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. Nah, I'm ok. Alright. I love you. Do you know that? Yeah, I know that. Drink it. Hi. Do you wanna stay here tonight? No, I'm gonna sleep on the couch. I won't do anything. I bet. God! Please stay in here with me. - Scoot over. - Yay! Noooo! Yes! Time to wake up! - No! - Wake up. - Wake up. - Why? So mean. Wake up. - Good mornin'. - Mornin'. What time is it? It's 4:30. Oh, holy shit. I'm sorry I got so shitfaced. Ah, it's alright. It happens to the best of us. Sugar? No. Yeah, I need to get you back to your truck. Oh, fuck that's right. Ok. Feel alright? Yeah. Oh, my god. Oh, my - Here. I'm so sorry. I am so sorry. Slow down, slow down... Slow down. Aw, I know. I know. Shhhh. This is so cool! That feels so good. That was amazing! Thank you! Hey, do you wanna get out of here? Go find something to eat? I can pay for myself. Um, I'm just gonna stay here for a bit and take a nap. Ok. I can tuck you in. Make you into a burrito. Thanks for coming to get me. You're welcome. So, where am I taking you? Back to school? Can I talk to you about something? Last night I was with this girl, and it was so great... And then the next day all I could think about was Jules. And it makes me really sad because, as much as I love Jules, we never had a night like that and I don't really know what to think. Well, I'll tell you what... The sun's gonna be up in about 20 minutes. Why don't I just take you to my house? You can meet my dog, I'll make you breakfast. And I gotta go to work; you can have the whole place to yourself. And figure out, you know, what your next move is. That's really nice. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey, c'mon in. That's my dog Towns. Oh, my goodness. Hi. He's been feeling pretty bad. He was kinda sick the other day. Hey. Hey, there. He's definitely doing better, though. What's her name? Who? - Your ex-wife. - Oh. Emily. We don't have to talk about it if you don't want to. No, it's ok. That was the worst time of my life. That's the closest I've ever been to being suicidal. I loved her, and I loved them. I just didn't love us, if that makes any sense. Did you get a divorce? No. We're still married. She's still my wife. The kids don't give a shit about money. I could've been broke, I could've been a drunk. But ignoring them was unforgivable. You're working on that, though. I guess, kind of. I went and saw my daughter and I tried to give her money, and she wouldn't take that. I asked her about her brother, Marco; she wouldn't tell me anything about him. She wouldn't even let me see my grandkids. I really fucked my life up. I really fucked their lives up. Aw, Towns. Tired, tired man. He likes you, though. For true equality, we need to add big G, the universal gravitational constant. This is just a number, a constant of the universe, which tells us how strong the gravitational force is... You ready? I hate coming here because we never actually talk. We just sit here and eat. Isn't that the point? You know what I mean. Have you talked to David lately? He's actually DJ-ing this, like, corporate, private party thing tonight. That sounds horrible. Yeah, I know. He told me about you guys. Yeah. I don't really wanna talk about it. Ok. I need to call my mom so she can pick me up, so I can go meet up with David. It's ok, I can take you. - Are you sure? - Uh-huh. You should come in and say hey, hang out for a bit. Yeah, I'll say hi to him. It could be fun. Ok. Do you think they'll let us in? - Hey. - What are you guys doing here? We're your plus-ones. This is so lame. Yeah. Well, it's good to see you guys. Remember that mix I told you about? Which one? This one... Tell me if you like it. I love you.
