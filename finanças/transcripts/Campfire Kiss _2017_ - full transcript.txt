(coffee machine beeping) Good morning. Oh, mom. Why do you always do that? Because it works. Come on, sweetie. Soccer uniform's packed, throw your cleats in for carpool. Mom. The early bird gets the worm. (alarm goes off) What about the early worm? He gets eaten. Time to go. But they're in the dragon's lair, Thorson and Krata. Arthur, come on. Bowl, plate, shoes. I've got that faculty thing this morning. I could just walk to school. We've talked about that. Now come on. The evil wizard is- Will be me if you don't- March, march, march. I know. You should read this book. I think you'd like it. A comic? Graphic novel. The teens in this book get to do a lot of things. Maybe even walk to school on their own. Let's go. I know 13 is the age they start to pull away, I just... I want to make sure he's doing it for developmentally appropriate reasons. Not because he doesn't like me. Who wouldn't like you? Maybe I'm uncool. You're his mom. Of course you're uncool. Maybe you could loosen the reins a little. What's the worst that could happen? I teach probability. I know exactly what could happen. Let's turn your brain off. Have a girl's night. Joe is away at his college reunion on the 28th. The 28th is the big school dance. I signed up to chaperone. So un-sign up. Ok, how about tonight? Meet me at the gym, we'll grab a drink, there's some new cute guys at my gym... You're married. You're not! How many years since you've been on more than one date? You remember how horrible those dates were. Which doesn't mean that you have to swear off completely. Take a chance. Anyway, tonight is- Fajita Friday? Am I that predictable? You're the one with the lesson plans all the way to 2047. No. 2045. (laughs) That's the year I retire. It makes sense. What did you guys decide to do for spring break? I want to do something to reconnect us, you know? Just get him to look up and out. Unplug. Exactly. Yeah. Unplug. Gotta go. (bell rings) Predictable. I rolled a five. There was a one in six chance of that happening because there's six numbers total. Now what do you think the chances are that any of you might roll another five? Adam. One in five? Close but not quite. Tabitha. One in six? That's right. Every time you roll the dice the odds are the same. You get a fresh chance to get what you want. Now over spring break I want you all to create your own real world math problem around the idea of probability. Be creative. Your problem could be about matching socks or the upcoming school dance- Like the chances of meeting your soulmate at the dance? (laughing) I'm not sure how you'd measure that, but if there's a formula I'm all ears. (bell rings) Have a wonderful rest of your day. Pi Day, that is. March 14th. 3.14159265358979323846264. Hey Tabitha. Going to the invitational dance? Hey Tabitha. You going to the dance? Arthur, your cleats. How are you gonna play without these? Oh, Tabitha, hey. Do you know Arthur? He's my son. Hi. Nice meeting you. She is so nice and smart. You should ask her to the dance. Huh? See you after soccer. Family bonding. Too far. Too expensive. Too dangerous. (door opens) Too weird. (door closes) Hi mom. Hey. How was it? Did you score any goals? I'm a defender. Yeah. You want some water? Ok. Defenders score goals, right? Yeah. No one can score from the bench though. Right. Well, how was the rest of school? Before or after my mother humiliated me in front of Tabitha? Oh, Arthur... I'm sorry. But I have an idea to make it up to you. I was thinking that for break we could do something fun, you know? Like go hiking or a road trip or something. Do you wanna brainstorm? Can I just play my guitar? Yeah. Yeah, I'll get dinner started. Maybe we could do it after. Ok. Fajita Friday? You know it. Family camping. Hmm. Bingo. Don't touch that. Excuse me? Why would I wait for you? I'll show you how to use it later. I think I know how to use it. After school? Oh, no, that's right. You're off next week, aren't you? Ok, pal. I don't know how you know I'm a teacher- I love you. Hey. Good morning. Oh, you weren't talking to me just then. I- No, professor. Professor? Wait, so you heard everything I said and you just let me ramble on and make a fool of myself? I held up a finger. Hey. Uh, the door sticks sometimes. Oh, you work here don't you? Guilty. You know that's no way to treat a customer, right? In fact, I would like to speak with your boss. And what would you like to say to him? Oh. You're the boss. Owner. I will not be giving you a good Yelp review. And I'm taking my business elsewhere. Uh, professor? What? It's broken anyway. Ah. I'm home! What was that? What's that? A music card. It's yours as soon as you're packed. We leave bright and early tomorrow morning. So exciting! What's all this? It's for the camping trip. What camping trip? A camping trip, dad? Seriously? Trust me, you're gonna love it. You've met me, right? Think of it this way: it's a great chance for you to get far away from school and recharge your batteries. Bear Creek's not even that far away. If you would have said Maui then I might actually go. It's just four days. Four days?! It's four days. In the mountains? Four whole days at Camp Bear Creek! You are aware that it's my spring break, right? You booked already, didn't you? It's not really camping, camping, which by the way I think you would totally love, it's camping in a nice tent. And there'll be other kids. Also roped in by their deranged parents? If you mean your fun dad who thinks of the craziest ideas that turn out to be the best times you've ever had then yes! Hiking, canoes, campfires, probably be a marshmallow or two. I told you last night at dinner. You weren't listening, were you? And it's my week. Your mom's at her conference, and what is the good in owning your own camping store if you can't try out the new gear? Is that a pink camouflage water bottle? I know, makes no sense, right? Look, this place looks great. They've got cabins, not tents, hot water, tons of activities. They've even got a glow-in-the-dark frisbee golf thing. Mom, this isn't like you. This is so you. Everything last minute, and it's all about you. Did you even bother to ask if I had plans? Did you? Holly was thinking of throwing a party. Who's Holly? Dad. Mom, do you even know how to camp? No. But what better time to learn than now? (playing video games) We'll figure it out together. And you can start by being my navigator on the trip. You know you have a GPS on your phone, right? No, I know, but we don't know what kind of reception we'll get up in the mountains. Can I just finish my game? You can play your game any time. Look up. It's beautiful here. So you're just gonna sit in the car for the next four days? Not if I get mom to pick me up. Maybe I'll just rule out cell phone usage entirely while we're gone. Then you wouldn't be Fun Dad, would you? You know, I actually printed out a list of activities so we don't miss any of the good ones. Let's see. Archery, arts and crafts... oh, what about the rock wall? Did you notice that they have a talent show? Is that why you had me bring my guitar? Well, I- Mom, you know I don't like to play in front of other people. (together) You gotta be kidding me. Well, this day just keeps getting better and better. Oh, I'm sorry. Were you talking to me? Touch√©. What is this? That is my cappuccino maker. Propane powered. I got it from Miller's Sporting Goods. I believe that's your competition. Yeah, I don't sell that frou frou camping gear, anyway. Then thank you for driving me to where I could find it. Uh, you don't happen to know where check-in is? Ah, right. Thank you. Uh huh. Mmmhmm. Arthur! Wake up! We're here! Ok, we've got you in Chipmunk which is right here. Ok. Thank you, Addy. No problem. Uh oh. You're looking a tad confused. It's not you. This is a confusing map. Good, then I'm not crazy. (laughs) Beverly. Dana. I- I wasn't expecting so much snow. Oh, it's a gift. First time camping? No. Yes. Oh, you're one of those super in touch people who reads everyone? Well, the price tags are still on your sleeping bag. Come on. This was just a last-minute trip to spend some time with my son. Good. We're not really connecting lately and he wants his independence so I'm trying not to obsess over the fact that he's still back at the archery range. Why am I telling you all of this? To convince yourself it was a good idea? I'm not very practiced at new things. Well, you're here, aren't you? Last minute? It looks like you're well-planned and well-organized, so now that you're here just breathe. Oh, you're in Chipmunk. Just follow the little chipmunks. Ok. Thank you. Great. Chipmunk overflow. Hmm. We can work with this. Fine, have it your way. Great. Great. What's with the Jeep? Too good to carry your stuff like the rest of us? Special privilege. Great. I just found out that Holly's party is a go for tomorrow night. Holly? Good one, Steve. Way to go. (announcement) It's orientation time, campers. At 8pm head on over to the fire pit. S'mores for the kids, wine for the grown ups. Can't wait. Ok everybody, gather 'round. Hey, um... you never told me. How was archery? No big deal. An arrow almost hit me in the leg. Gotcha. (clears throat) Ok. Good evening, campers. Welcome to Camp Bear Creek, I'm Addy, the activities director for those of you who haven't met me. Now, we have so many fun activities we want to share with you. We know they're gonna bring us all closer together, but first I would like to introduce one of our long-time instructors Ms. Beverly Gowers. (applause) Thank you, thank you. Beverly will be teaching arts and crafts and also leading games and activities. Mmmhmm. And when I'm not leading you on an artistic journey you can join me at the stables. Now, there are a few simple rules. This area is called Bear Creek for a reason. There are bears. They're actually more afraid of us than we are of them. Hmm. Has anyone asked the bears? But if we don't give them a reason to come in the camp they won't. So just make sure you keep any food in the bear boxes. And Julie thought I was crazy for bringing Tupperware. And one more thing that's very important: there is a big woods out there, so it's easy to get lost. So just stay on the trails and stay within sight of camp. Great advice. Oh, I almost forgot. One of our campers, Steve Reynolds, has generously donated a brand new canoe for camp. Thank you, Steve. (applause) Don't forget, at 8pm there's s'mores for the kids and wine for the adults. Or both. (laughs) Let's go this way. Sneaky way to get special parking privileges. Hey, you donate a canoe you get perks. (laughs) Look, why don't we start over? We obviously got off on the wrong foot, which was your fault by the way. It was. I'm sorry. I'm Steve. Dana. I guess I owe you an apology, too, for that bad Yelp review. I am so sorry, I will take it down as soon as I get home. I'm not too worried about it. You should be. I mean, there are plenty of people who won't set foot inside a restaurant or a store if it doesn't get at least four stars. Those people really need to relax. You- you mean, like me? Are you saying I'm uptight? No, not at all. You seem like you have a lot on your mind. You know, coming here was practically spur-of-the-moment. That makes me the opposite of uptight. I'm adventurous. So you better look out, nature boy. (chuckles) Come on. What're you doing? Oh, I'm making a fire from two sticks. I read how to do it online. Hmm. Come on. How long have you been doing it? Uh, I don't know. I can't feel my arms. Still at it, huh? Oh, I'll get there. Yeah, you'll see. This girl can camp. Yeah, no question about it. Oh, you gotta be kidding me. What? We're not on "Survivor". Why didn't you tell me you had matches? You've got a propane powered cappuccino machine. I figured you had thought of everything. You know, you are just- Mom! Hang on just a minute. You're one of those know-it-all campers who just thinks that- Mom! What?! You did it! You started a fire. I did it? I did it! Ha! Oh, uh, we have to blow. Oh, right. High five. Pretty great, huh? Mmmhmm. Best hot dog ever. It kind of is. I might have to get one of these fire pits for the house. Back yard camping. So when's the talent show? Really? You could do that song you were practicing last week. You know, the one with the chords? I can get you sheet music if you want. I meant you. You should sing. No. I mean... I wouldn't even have time to prepare anything. If you say so. But you're really good. (announcement) Hey campers. 20 minutes until the kids and the adults get their own mixers right by the rec centres. S'mores for the kids. I love s'mores. I love you s'mores. (giggles) Get it? Yeah, I get it. Hey. Cheers. You know, there's a few single fathers here tonight. No, no, no. I'm- I'm just here to bond with my son. You know what I teach outside camp? Uh-uh. Stretching. Gary, this is Dana. Dana, Gary. Gary's from Nevada, aren't you, Gary? Yeah. Hmm. You've ever been to Nevada, Dana? Uh, no, I uh... I'm not much of a gambler. Oh, me neither. Well, not anymore. Cool pool. I used to have one just like it. Bet ya it takes a lot of chlorine to clean it. Hey, Lace. How was the kid's thing? Mmm. You stay out long? Mmm. Lace. I'm going to bed. Tomorrow we can do some fun things. Yeah, ok. Hi mom. Oh, hi, hey! Hey, how was it? It was pretty good. We played that glow-in-the-dark frisbee golf thing. It was fun? You're having fun? Yeah, it's great. Really? You'd tell me if it wasn't? No. Smart mouth. I really wanna try the rock wall. Um, if it fits in the schedule. Go brush your teeth. Come on, bed time. (rustling noises) (clanging) (gasps) Arthur! What? Bear. Bear? Oh, hi! Sorry, excuse me. Wake up. There's a bear. A bear?! Yeah. Did you see a bear? Yeah. What?! Oh, come on. I am so telling mom about this. I don't think you can blame me for a bear coming into camp. Well, we're camping with the bears. Bears don't just come into camp! It's in our tent! Why is he in our tent? Did you leave food out in your tent? In Tupperware like the arts and crafts lady said. You left your food in Tupperware? Didn't you hear her say that all leftovers and food have to be put in the bear boxes? That's not a brand of container? Nope. It's those black steel storage bins that say "bear box" on them that keep bears from sniffing around looking for food in people's tents. Oh, those. Well, that could have been clearer in the presentation! We have got to get rid of this bear. What're you doing? Getting things that we can bang together. Take that. Make as much noise as we possibly can, that should scare away the bear. I wanna help. Arthur, you're not going anywhere near a bear. None of you are. You're gonna make as much noise as you can right here inside the tent. Ok. Ok, close the flaps behind me. Wait, but dad... It's ok. I got this. Ready? Yeah. On the count of three. One, two, three. (clanging and yelling) Ok, come on bear. Go, bear! Go! Go, go, go! (raccoon titters) Steve! It's gone. Did you see it go? It was just a- Your dad saved us! It was so big! It was really, really big and scary. Wow. That's so cool you did it. So cool. That's my dad. Alright, let's get inside. Come on. (owl hooting) I'm not usually a rescue the damsel kinda woman. You seem like you can handle yourself. It's a compliment. Oh. Lacey's changed a lot the last year. I mean, with the divorce and starting high school. What's more is she's smart but she's really pulled back from working hard and she'd rather be texting, and these girls, and I don't know, talking about boys and clothes. So you thought you'd bring her some place where there was spotty cell service and make-up wouldn't matter? Yes. She'll come out the other side. A work in progress. I teach teenagers. I get it. What do you teach? Eighth grade math. Oh, now that is brave. (laughs) Hey, at least you like the outdoors. I thought... I don't know. I thought coming here might boost Arthur's confidence. Connect us. But I don't know anything about camping. All I've done so far is bring a bear into camp. That was just day one. Wait 'til you see what happens on day two. Two bears? (laughs) Um, well I should probably get some sleep. I'll stand watch. Thanks again. Ok. Goodnight. So can you come pick me up? Well, I wanna go hang out with Holly and her friends. You uh, think about high school much? Most of my friends are going. You won't be there. What could be bad? Hilarious. So I looked at the schedule you put together for today. Mmmhmm? Tree identification? Yeah. No? Uh, we could do arts and crafts. Or you wanna try yoga with me? Ok, what do you want to do? Besides the rock wall. What's wrong with the rock wall? You mean, other than falling and breaking every bone in your body? No, little kids go rock climbing. Instructors attach you to ropes. It's fine. So not like that time you fell out of the tree? I was four. And your arm didn't set right. It's fine now. See? Is there anything else you'd wanna do? Food tastes pretty good in the open air, huh? Sure. Did you um, take a look at those activities? There's lots of fun things to do on that list. Fun, fun. That's what we're here for. Isn't there anything that you're interested in? Well, is there anything that I can use my phone for? Lace... Wait, wait, wait. Yeah, geocaching. We could go geocaching. What's geocaching? It's like a hunt in the woods. Your GPS gives you coordinates and the coordinates lead you to a treasure box. What's the treasure? Well, it depends. Nothing, like, valuable or anything but maybe meaningful. The thing is, if you take something you have to leave something. Ok, what should we leave? I'll figure it out. Do we need to bring anything? No, just my phone and two water bottles. One of them pink. You game? A treasure hunt in the woods. Hmm. I'm game. Ah, great minds. Oh, hi. Uh, can we join you? Yeah, sure. Great. (Arthur): My phone has a better signal. (Lacie): My phone has more charge. Finally, a use for those phones. Yeah. It is so beautiful here. You guys, come look! There's a bridge! Uh, that's- that's off the path. They said we were supposed to- There's a trail on the other side. And there's a cache in the woods. Let's do it. Mom? Well... if Steve thinks it's ok. (laughs) This way! It's really coming down. Let's take cover. Whew. It's coming down, huh? Yeah. Oh my gosh, it's pouring. (laughing) We should be ok here. (laughing) It's so wet out here. It is. So what grade are you in? I'm a freshman. At which school? Jefferson. Arthur's going there next year. How do you like it? First time camping, huh? What do you think so far? It's alright. Play any sports? Yeah, I play a little bit of soccer. I'm pretty good at Madden on the Xbox. (laughs) Why would anybody do math on purpose? Isn't it just for nerds? (laughs) No. It's for people who want to challenge themselves. Find out what they're made of. But what if you challenge yourself and you still don't get anywhere? That's when you double down. When you work hard and solve something you didn't think you could, that's when you prove to yourself that you were stronger and smarter than you thought. That's what I love about math. If that makes me a nerd, so be it. Rock wall, huh? Yeah. My mom's pretending it won't fit in the schedule. She just doesn't want me to do it, though. Ah. She probably has her reasons. She's worried that I'll fall. Yeah. That just means she cares. Well, she's the one that's afraid of heights. Well, that is altogether different. You know, if you ever want any help or if there's anything I can walk you through just let me know. It's clearing up. Let's go. Ok. You know, algebra is my favourite. What're you guys chatting about? Girl talk. Guys, we lost the signal on our phones. We wandered off the path and now we don't know where the geocache is. We're lost? Now this is an adventure. We- we can't be- I mean, they're gonna come find us, right? Well, we wandered off the path. How are they even gonna know? Dad? Ok, we won't be back for dinner, someone will come looking for us. It's fine. No, it's not fine. I mean, do- do we stay here? Do we try to walk back? I mean, what if we get more lost? What if there's a bear? Oh my gosh, this can't get any worse! Mom, the fitness tracker on my phone. I set it when we crossed the bridge. We took 3,984 steps. That's a lot of steps. Ok, let's go. (coyotes howling) Quickly. Wait, wait, hold on guys, hold on. I think we're really close to the geocache treasure. It says that it's right... yeah, guys, the geocache! We made it! Here. Oh, there's not much in there. What is it? Here it is... (laughs) How about that. Oh, we should sign the log. Here. Right, here's that. What're you gonna write? Probably my initials. Alright. Here, I'll put it back. Oh, no. We didn't bring anything to put back in the box. Yeah we did. I'll put it away. Ok, now can we go? Yeah. (laughs) Let's go. Alright. (together) One, two, three, four, five... A lot of steps to go. (together) Seventy-three, seventy-four, seventy-five, seventy-six, seventy-seven, seventy-eight, seventy-nine, eighty, eighty-one, eighty-two, eighty-three, three thousand nine hundred and eighty-four! There's the bridge! We made it! Alright! That was fun. Dana, stop. Look behind you. Please don't say it's a bear. Just- (laughs) Just look. And no bears. Or raccoons. Ah, listen- It's ok, it's ok. I get it. I get it. Thank you. Mom! Come on! I'm hungry! Push down as the rest of your body rises up. This is how we build our strength. We push down so we can soar like an eagle. Shoulders back. Ooh, are you tight. It was a bumpy morning. That's more than one morning. Alright, let's go to salutation. That's it, buddy. Right there. Your foot's solid, yep. Now step. There, perfect. Alright, you're doing it. How're you feeling? Good. Ok, now push. Yes! You're a natural, bud. It's gonna get more technical up here. Ok, this is getting trickier. You see right there on that grip on your right? Uh huh. Reach for that and pull yourself up. Yeah? You should be able to get it. Almost. I don't think I can. Oh yeah, sure you can, man. Just get your feet, both of them, underneath you. You need a little chalk. Reach your right hand back and grab some chalk. There you go. Arthur. Bring your left leg up to here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ok now, ready? Push off of your left leg and you reach for that. You got this. There you go. Look at that! Nice job. Way to go, Arthur! Now, it's ok, don't look down, Arthur. You're good. Don't look down. Right there. Ready? (gasps) Arthur! It's ok, buddy. It's alright, he's fine. The instructor's got him. You're good, bud. It's ok, I think I'm done. No, no, no, no, no. We're almost there, bud. You're so close. Ready? Get your feet underneath you. There you go. And push. Oh yeah, you're there. Yes! (rings bell) (laughing) Good job! Nice job. (clapping) Oh man, that was hard. How do we get down? Lean back. That's it, buddy. That's it. That's good. Look up a bit. There you go. Here we go. Lean back. You got this. Have a little fun with it, bud. Mom, I'm sorry. I should have told you. You were amazing! I... yeah, no, uh... I would like to see you try it again sometime. Really? Yeah. Thanks mom. I will. I'll see you back at the tent. I'm gonna go practice my guitar. That was incredible. That was so much- You dragged my child away from our tent without my permission? When I think of what could have happened up there? Dragged? I didn't drag. And nothing happened- Were you just thinking about yourself? How cool you'd be to him? That's not what happened. (playing guitar) Don't stop. I'm not very good. Sounded pretty good to me. Thanks. So your mom said you're going to Jefferson next year. I go there. But I'm warning you I don't talk to freshmen. Aren't you a freshman? Next year, when I'm a sophomore, I won't be speaking to freshmen. But we can hang out now, 'til this torture ends. Keep playing. (playing guitar) (jazz music playing) (applause) Wow, wonderful! Good job, Nat. Ok. Who's next? Don't be shy. Dad, you should do your magic trick. No, no, no. I can't I- My dad can do magic tricks! No, she's lying. Steve? Steve, get up here. You wanted to come to the talent show. Ok. I don't have any money. (applause) Uh, I need, uh, some money. Does anybody have a dollar, a twenty? Oh, this camper's gonna produce cash. Or one hundred. Alright. Steve's funny. Thank you. He's not that funny. This twenty dollar bill, good shape... ready? Well, he's nice. When I turn around... Like earlier when I asked him to go rock climbing. One hundred percent... You asked him? Yeah. Stand by. I'm just gonna fix this. (clears throat) Oh boy. Um, ha. Uh... this used to kill in college. (laughing) I seem to have lost my edge. Thank you. (applause) I'll get that back to you. Look out David Blaine. Great job, Steve. Ok, anyone else? That was fun. Arthur? Don't be shy. Anybody? Come on, guys. I can sing. Dana, yeah! Come on, let's see it. (applause) Dana, everybody. Alright, get on up here. (clears throat) Uh, this is for all you pie lovers out there. No, no, not the dessert. ‚ô™ Pi is equal to ‚ô™ ‚ô™ three point one four five nine two ‚ô™ ‚ô™ six five three five eight nine seven ‚ô™ ‚ô™ nine three two three eight four six two ‚ô™ ‚ô™ six then four three three eight three two ‚ô™ ‚ô™ seven nine five oh two eight eight four one ‚ô™ ‚ô™ nine seven one six... ‚ô™ That's amazing. ‚ô™ Nine three nine nine ‚ô™ ‚ô™ three seven five one oh five eight two ‚ô™ ‚ô™ oh nine seven four and then nine four four five ‚ô™ ‚ô™ and two and then three oh seven ‚ô™ ‚ô™ eight one six four... ‚ô™ hey, where's the end? (laughing and applause) Wow. Thank you. Thanks. Wow, is anyone else's mind blown? Because my mind is blown. Ok, is there anyone else? Is that everyone? Going once, going twice... If I can do it, so can you. There's gotta be someone else. Well, everyone, there's hot chocolate in the rec room. I wanna thank all of you for sharing your talents tonight. Arthur, yes, get up here! (applause) Go Arthur! Um, this is a song I've been learning the past few weeks so I hope you enjoy. You got this, sweetie. Uh, let me re-start. (playing guitar) Woo! (applause) Go Arthur! Woo! Who knew you were so talented? You too. (laughs) Ah, that's just Lacey, she's trying to get at me. Can you do a rendition of Pythagoras's theorem, too? Ooh, don't tempt me. (laughs) You are nerdier than I thought. Oh, I am beyond nerdy. And not just about math. I love Star Wars. I know everything about Wookies and Jedis. Wow. I'm into Star Trek. I love Star Trek! (laughs) Listen, I... I owe you an apology. For what? Arthur told me that he's the one who came to you about the rock wall. I should have asked you first. Thank you. But I'm officially sorry. And I am officially enjoying getting to know you. Me too. Well, goodnight. Yeah, goodnight. You're such a good boy. Is that good? That's a beautiful horse. Oh, hey. I was hoping you'd stop by. Grab a brush. This is Teddy. He's a Norwegian Fjord. Horses just give me peace. Here, right up there. He loves that. Right there. All down his stripe. Oh. Good. I think Steve tried to kiss me. Do you want him to kiss you? No, of course not. Maybe. Yes. Well, good. No, we're total opposites. (chuckles) You are the yin to his yang. But I don't believe in opposites attract. I mean, you have to have at least some common interests. Anyway, I'm not even looking to date. I mean, it is not on my timetable right now. I didn't know that love paid attention to timetables. That's funny. Love? I didn't say anything about love. I was just talking about a- a kiss. Mmmhmm. That didn't even happen. Well then it's a good thing it didn't happen 'cause I'd hate to see how worked up you got if it did. What's the worst that could happen? The last time I opened myself up... it didn't go very well. Well, what if you're a different person now than you were then? What if you are stronger than you know? Come on. (laughs) Yes! Cappuccino. Hi. Yeah, it's pretty good. You wanna try some? Ok. Why not? It's alright. Ok, I'll admit that that's a completely unnecessary camping tool if you'll admit that that is better than alright. Ok, it's really good. Right?! Listen- Dad, what're we doing today? What do you wanna do? What do I wanna do? Let's go. Alright, Fun Dad. Let's go. Yeah, are you sure you want to do this? You're not scared, are you? No, I'm just not that big on horses. So yes. Not a fearful bone in my body. (neighing) There we go. So I just grab these, yeah? I'm ready. Ok, here you go. Go. Go forward. (chuckles) Giddy-up. Come on, come on. No, no, no, no, no! Aaaaaah! (laughing) Thank you for doing this with me. Yeah. Oh, I think uh... It's ok, I got it. Thanks for coming out here with me. Of course. So what's on your mind? I guess I just don't see how math relates to real life. There's this girl, Jenny, she says it's gonna matter later on but I just don't get it. You know, doing math is like going to the gym for your brain. By the way, cute shoes. Thank you. How much did you spend on them? Is this gonna be a math problem? How much? The were $150. Wow. That's like $60 more than twice what I spent on my shoes. Fine, I get it. You spent $45 because I know addition and multiplication. No, you solved for x. That's algebra. If x is the price of my shoes, then 2x plus- Plus 60 equals 150. Yes! Lacey, you understand math better than you realize. Maybe I just don't have a great teacher. Maybe. But can I guess something else? Maybe you thought smart girls wouldn't be popular so when you got to high school you stopped studying as much as you used to and six months goes by and you get behind. Math is cumulative, so now, even if you wanted to catch up, it feels like you can't. There's this girl, Holly, she says that studying is for losers but she's kind of like- But she's friends with everyone who matters. So because of that you decided that it's ok to be less than who you are? No, I just thought that maybe- What if being smart makes you more powerful and more in control of your life? What if you are stronger than you think? And... And? And you can be smart and popular. And if this Holly person doesn't think so, what if she's the one losing out? Your friend Jenny sounds pretty cool. Lacey told me what you did for her. Oh... Thank you. She just needed someone to sort of sit down with her and talk it through. She's so bright. Really. Yeah, she is. I'm not great at the sitting still part. Sometimes I worry the reason Arthur struggled with confidence is because of me. And I worry I'm the reason Lacey doesn't try harder at school. I think the kids are playing Capture The Flag during lunch today. Arthur was saying something about that. You wouldn't want to share a campfire and eat our lunches together, would you? We have hot dogs. Hot dogs! Sounds like a plan. (laughs) I mean, not like a plan plan, but more like a spontaneous meal. That's exactly what I was thinking. Cool. Great. Uh, wanna meet in 15 minutes? Yeah, sounds good. Ok. It's... I'm gonna go over there. Yeah. Ok. 15. Ok. 15. Yeah. Jeans. Cargo pants. Sweatpants. Jeans. Jeans. Ah, I think it's jeans. Hey. Hello. Do you know which tent is Steve Reynolds? Yeah, yeah. He's... Hi, I'm Robin. Steve's wife. Ex-wife. Can't believe I still get that wrong. I'm Dana. Uh, Steve's uh... next tent neighbour. Robin? What're you doing here? I thought you had your conference in Aspen. I did, but Lacey kept texting me to come pick her up. I told you on the phone, I have everything under control. I know you did, and coming up here was a great idea. By the way, this place looks amazing. I can't believe you never took me up here. I mean, I could actually camp at a place like this, right? Look, I'm sorry if I overstepped my boundaries, but she sounded miserable, and this is the first break I could take from the conference. Mom. You're here. You don't remember texting me about how horrible this place was and to come and pick you up? Oh, right. Yeah. Um, well this place really isn't so bad. Sorry, mom. It's fine. Stick it out with your dad, I'll head into town and find a hotel. But now that you're here you should stay with us. She can stay with us, right dad? I mean, we have enough room. Lacey, it's your dad's time, anyway. And I don't have any camping gear. You came all the way up here. You know what? You can bunk with me and Lacey. Steve can stay with my son. I don't know. No, no. It's settled. Lacey, why don't you help your mom with her stuff? Thank you. Yeah. Um... thank you. I- Steve, I get it. It's fine. Alright, I'll go get started on the hot dogs. For five. I really appreciate you doing this, Dana. Oh, yeah, it's fine. Lovely to have you. Look how nice you made it in here. It's uh, it's so homey. Oh. You have a great touch. Yeah, we just- we... Well, I'll um, stay here I guess while you go do your thing and um- No, mom, you should come with us. It'll be fun. Well, if- if you're game? Game? Um, yeah, no, that's me. I'm totally game. Great. Yeah. Let's do it. Ready... aim... fire. Woo! Wow, nice shot. Beginner's luck. Archers, get your arrows. And we were stuck at the top of the ferris wheel and Steve was shaking. Ok, I was not shaking. You're afraid of heights? Dad, is that why you don't like horses? No, I like horses fine, I like heights fine, I just don't like high horses. (laughs) It's ok mom, you're doing great. Thanks. Go ahead, honey. Ok. Yeah. I'll be at the zip line. Ok. I don't think that actually happened. It did happen. (laughing) Dana, slow down. Oh, no, no, I'm fine. No, no, please go back. I don't need to. You know, you try and be spontaneous, you try not to plan... What're we not talking about? (chuckles) So much for our non-date. Yeah. The ex-wife showing up didn't really help. Listen. Listen, it's not- we're not- there's nothing between us. There hasn't been for a long time. Is she good at everything she tries? It's infuriating, right? Why'd you guys break up? Well, when you're with the right person you compliment each other. They have some things that you need and you have things that they need. It's a match. Exactly. And I don't think we were ever the right fit. What about you? Arthur's father? Um, he and I were high school sweethearts. Even before Arthur was born I think we both knew it wasn't going to last. We stuck it out for a year or two but uh... it turns out he wasn't really cut out to be a dad. He's more of a Christmas card and birthday present kind. You deserve better. I think that's... that's why I don't put myself out there. You know, I want to protect Arthur. Maybe not just Arthur. I- I should go find him. Arthur? Arthur? Hey. Hi. Mom, are you ok? Yeah, I'm fine. Ok. You know, maybe it's time for us to pack up and go home. Right now? But what about the big camp fire and all the goodbyes? What about all that? I thought you didn't really wanna be here. Well, I didn't. But I'm having fun now. Really? I- I made you camp in the snow and do arts and crafts. Yeah, but we did lots of other cool things. And besides, there's still some things I'd like to do before we go. Ok then. We'll stay. Cool. Mind if I join you? Oh, um... sure. You seemed upset before. Oh, I'm fine. What do you think about Steve? Steve? Why? I think he likes you and I think you like him, too. I- And I think you would be good together. You don't know me. I'm usually right about these things. About setting up your ex-husband with other women? About good people who would be good together. Why are you telling me this? I talked with Lacey. I'm heading back down the hill to find a hotel for myself. I wanted to thank you for your hospitality and I wanted to tell you that he's a great guy and I hope you give him a chance. Mom! Come with me. Where are we going? Up. Is this a good idea? There's a grip to your left. Grab it and pull up. Use your legs. How do you know this? Steve taught me. Now push. That's it. Good job. I uh... you know, we're getting pretty high. Yeah, yeah we are. You know, um, I'll- I'll just stop here. Why don't you go ahead? Mom. If I can do it you can do it. Push down so you can soar. That's it, keep going. Remember, use your legs. Nice. Now push. Push. You're almost there. (rings bell) Yeah! Victory! Woo hoo! Woo! Good job, mom! Hot chocolate. Mmm. You were amazing. Oh, you too. I never would have done that on my own. Arthur, serious question. Have I held you back? Have my fears kept you from doing fun things? I don't know, maybe. I don't want you to be afraid of things. I don't want you to be afraid of things, either. It's so good. (music playing) Hey, what're you doing? Oh, um... I was just... I was downloading math games. To practice math. Well, that's cool. Uh, what year are you? Ninth at Jefferson in Denver. Tenth at Jefferson, too. Really? I've never seen you there. I think I've seen you. It's Lacey, right? Well, I guess I'll see you at the bonfire? Yeah, see you there. Hey. Holly? Um, no. Jenny, actually. I was seeing what she's doing at the end of spring break when we get back home. I saw you left our old key in the geocache box. I think when your mom and I split I was so worried about you being sad that I just pushed for everything to be fun. All the time. But I think in doing that I might have missed out on what you really need. I'm here for you, Lace. For any reason. At any time. If you reach out, I'll listen. I promise. So Maui, huh? You think Maui's a better choice? You think it'd be a better spot for spring break? Isn't that, like, crazy expensive? Not if you camp in the woods there. It's pretty good. (laughs) I'm kidding. We'll stay in a hotel on the beach. But you know what? I actually really loved coming here with you. Really? Really. Wanna go make s'mores at the bonfire? Would you mind if I went ahead alone? No, not at all. Thank you. Hey. I spend a lot of time looking up at these stars when I go camping. What's your favourite constellation? Hmm. Draco. It's the one that circles the North Star. What're you looking at? Oh, wow. Listen, I wanted to tell you something about Robin. Oh, that's ok, really. It's- She's getting re-married. Yeah, she was gonna wait to tell me back in Denver but she decided to do it today. Wow. How does that make you feel? Truthfully? Liberated. I feel really good around you. Me too. I made you something. You did? (laughs) Arts and crafts. Yes. I love it. Awe. No one's ever made me a bracelet before. Thank you. So... what now? What do you mean? Well, this is our last night here, so what happens when we go back home? Uh, I didn't really think that far ahead. Is something wrong? Dana, I like you... But what? You don't wanna be in another relationship? I just wanted to kiss you again and see what happens next and let that be enough. Can we do that? Goodnight, Steve. Hey. Are you ok? Oh yeah, never better. We got things to do before the bonfire. Uh, well can I just finish my- No, you need to pack. We're leaving in the morning. Ok. Alright everybody, come around the fire close one last time please. Awe, farewells are so hard. (crowd murmurs) Another one in the can. Let's hold hands. We hope you've had a wonderful time full of adventure and new friends. Take back with you the spirit of what you've learned here. I've seen some great acts of bravery, love, kindness. Remember these new discoveries you've made, the new activities that you've tried, and the new people that you've met. Know that nothing will diminish the time that we've had here, no matter what happens next. And we wish you all happy adventures, lasting friendships, and amazing experiences. Until we meet again... One, two, three! (together) Camp Bear Creek! Woo! (crowd cheers) Alright, hug it out. Come here. I'll miss you. Lacey. Hey. What's this? I made it in arts and crafts. I thought you might like it. You know, because you left your other necklace in the geocache. Thank you. Yeah. You better not be crushing on me. Nah. There's a girl I like at school. Tabitha. But I just wanted to give you something to thank you for being nice to me. And also so you'll remember me. I'll be seeing you at school in the fall, dork. Yeah, but you won't be talking to me. Give me your phone. Um, ok. What're you doing? Giving you my number so when you get to high school next year I'll let you say hi to me once or twice. If you promise not to be a total geek. Deal. Come on, Arthur. Time to load up. Ok. Hey, say hi to Tabitha. Girls like guys who have guts. Ok. Hey. Thanks for the help with math. I really appreciate it. Any time. I mean it. If I can help. Thank you. So, you like Tabitha, huh? Mom. All ready? Let's go. Hey, listen. I was thinking about- It was so nice meeting you. Yeah, you too. Yeah. Listen, I'm sorry- There's nothing to be sorry for. We had fun. But now, back to reality. Safe drive back. Yeah, you too. Thanks for taking me up here. Maybe we could do this again next year? Really? Mmmhmm. I would love that. And maybe we could invite Steve and Lacey to join us, too. Maybe. Then, of course, we have to reduce the fraction. (bell rings) Uh, thank you so much, I'll see you tomorrow. Excuse me, Ms. Henderson? Yes. Hi. Did you want us to present our real world math problems? Oh, uh, you did it? Chances of meeting my soul mate at the dance. You wrote out a formula for that? Mmmhmm. There's number of students coming to the dance, those coming already coupled up versus those coming single and random kids coming from different schools. That's ambitious. But you might have missed a few variables. Like kids getting sick or something? Well, to start you're assuming everyone even has a soul mate and that they live within driving distance of the school. The problem is, how do you know if you've met your soul mate? Or what if you thought he was the one and he wasn't so sure? And there's probably not a formula for that. Well, each time you roll the dice the odds are the same, right? So every time you just have a fresh chance to get what you want. And, you know, maybe you just gotta keep going to dances to make the formula work. Thanks, Jillian. You're not answering your texts, you haven't stopped by my office... I've been busy. Really? Rumour has it you haven't finished grading your papers yet. You're the one who said it's not a big deal if I don't turn them in on time. For everyone else. For you that's serious. I don't know what's going on. Did something happen at camp you didn't tell me about? The same thing that happens every time I put myself out there. It doesn't work out. So what're you saying? That things didn't go the way you planned? I didn't plan, ok? You really liked him. I really liked him. (door opens) Hey, you're early. Yeah, I didn't feel like going to the mall. How was your math quiz? Uh, not bad. There was only two questions I didn't know. I could help you if you like. I might remember something from high school. Thanks, but me and Jenny are gonna get together before class tomorrow. Jenny. She's the one that's cool with math, yeah? Yeah, she's pretty cool all around. Ok. I'm gonna go do homework in the office. You should call her. Jenny? Dana. Yeah, it's not gonna happen. Dad, you're so clueless. It's not in the cards. I already blew my chance. Well then you better deal yourself a new hand. You scored a goal today? You were a different player out there, sweetie. Thanks. So Lacey texted me. I thought maybe we could invite them over. That's probably not a great idea. Why not? You like Steve. Maybe you guys could go on a date. What makes you think that I would want to date Steve? Because it was obvious you two liked each other. I- I think our time has passed. (phone vibrating) Hey. They so need to get together. She won't call him. I know, he's too stubborn to call her, too. They totally deserve each other. We need to get them together in person. The dance! The dance would be a perfect place for them to meet. But it's tonight. We just have to work fast. Get your dad there. Oh, don't you look nice. What's the occasion? The dance? Can I catch a ride? Uh, sure. I'm not gonna go, but... Why? You're a chaperone. Well, I was but I thought you might like to go to something and not have your mom there. Uh, I- I like having you there. You do? Yeah. Having a mom that's a teacher is super cool. Ok. If you want. I mean, I'm sure they could use the help. Great. Uh, just get changed fast. We gotta go. I'm cool again. (ARthur): Great. See you there. Great. My turn. Hey, dad, can you- Give you a ride to the dance? (jingles keys) You're right, I need to talk to Dana. Ok, let's go home because you need to change. That's true. Let's go. He's really cute. (clears throat) Six inches apart, you two. Hands on hips, please. Thank you. Sometimes I wish I was still in middle school. When love was simple. You obviously don't remember middle school. Hey Tabitha. I'm Arthur. Arthur, I remember. Um, do you wanna dance? Sure. Look! Oh, Julie. Look. Our boy's all grown up. I even let him walk to school a couple times on his own since we've been back. Amazing. (giggling) Oh, uh, you two, you're not supposed to be up there. Would you care to dance? What're you doing here? I came here to see you. Steve, I- I- I like you, I really do- Listen, before you tell me that I missed my chance with you just let me say what I came here to say. I got this suit pressed just for this. You planned something? Yes. What I didn't plan on was having these feelings. Ever since we left camp you're the only thing that I can think about. I even ordered some of those propane powered cappuccino machines. I'm a trendsetter. They're selling really well. Dana, listen. I know that... I come across like I don't care but it's just because I'm stupid scared, and I didn't wanna screw up another relationship with someone I cared about. The time apart has only made things more clear. You're the one I wanna screw things up with. Wait. I wanna try and screw things up with you. (laughs) No, it's not coming out right. Steve... I- I wanna roll the dice and- And take a chance. I know that sounds crazy- ‚ô™ I wanna be wide awake ‚ô™ ‚ô™ to make this dream come true. ‚ô™ Me too. ‚ô™ With you. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Oh, I wanna be wide awake ‚ô™ ‚ô™ to live my life with you, ‚ô™ ‚ô™ with you. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Years from now, ‚ô™ ‚ô™ looking back from where we stand, ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Will this be a moment ‚ô™ ‚ô™ we'll always remember? ‚ô™ ‚ô™ When we took a chance ‚ô™ ‚ô™ on the kind of love ‚ô™ ‚ô™ that lasts forever and ever, ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I wanna be wide awake ‚ô™ ‚ô™ to make this dream come true, ‚ô™ ‚ô™ with you. ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I wanna be wide awake ‚ô™ ‚ô™ to live my life with you, ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Please tell me dreams come true... ‚ô™ ‚ô™
