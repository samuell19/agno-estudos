Whoa! Major Sharpe are we lost sir? J... Are we lost? No, Lieutenant Jenkins, I'm here for the hell of it. Wherever "here" is. We need a compass. - Or a map. - We've got a bloody map for all the use it is. Bloody supply escorts. That's not soldiering. - We should have found the wagons by now. - I know. I think it was back at the ruined village, sir. We should have stayed the other side of the stream. Bloody maps! I don't think it's the map, sir. Well, perhaps it was, sir. Actually, it's not a very good map at all, sir. I mean. Whoever drew it... Shut up! Rifles, take cover! Catch him, Pat. Whoa, whoa. Whoa. Good. Good. Come on. Then. I think he's one of ours. - Spaniards? - Spaniards in grey? Nah. The Dons are always gaudy. So they are. They don't like dying in drab cloths. - They've got French weapons. - Well... Maybe they've run out of dye. Chargez! Maybe they've run out of luck. - Yee-ah! Yah! - Dan, bring him down. Good shot, Dan... It's wolf fur. Oh, my God... it hooks like we've found our supplies. Harris, Perkins, take picket. - Lieutenant Jenkins. - Sir? Get this lot buried. - I want to be out of this place in an hour. - Sir. Horse shit, sir. Back near the clearing. Loads of it. Some from yesterday and some... fresh. - They were waiting, then? - Aye. 20 or 30 of them, by my reckoning. Took 'em by surprise. Rode off north with the wagons. Can we track 'em? 30 horses and two heavy wagons? A blind man could track them, sir. - My lord. Munro. From His Most Catholic Majesty, King Ferdinand, my lord. I've taken the precaution of reading it. Shall I read it for you now? - His Most Catholic Majesty... - Yes, yes, yes. Get on with it! ...in a spirit of regal cooperation with his cousin of England and in his great desire to drive the French invader from the sacred soil of Spain, has directed the Real Compa?ia Irlandesa... That's the Royal Irish Company, my lord. ...of His Most Catholic Majesty's Household Guard, under the command of Colonel the Lord Kiely, to attach itself to the forces of Field Marshal the Lord Wellington, sir. - Copy to Horse Guards, I presume? - Copy to the Prince Regent himself. - Can we intercept it? - No, sir. He'll be flattered by the gesture. - Yes, which means we're stuck with them. - They'll prove decorative. I don't need "decorative"! I need an extra battalion of trained foot with full equipment. Are they all Irish? Most of the company's Spanish-bon these days, though they have to be descended from Irish exiles. - Put them to latrine digging. - My lord. If we employ the King of Spain's household guard on menial tasks, it'll be construed as an insult to our Spanish allies, as well as to His Most Catholic Majesty. Damn His Most Catholic Majesty and damn this Kiely. I know the Irish peerage. Irish Catholic exiles. You're paid to advise me, Munro, so earn your damn pay. I fear we have to welcome Lord Kiely and his men, even while we mistrust them. It seems to me that we must do our best to make them feel... uncomfortable. Drive them out? How? Bivouac them close to the French lines, so that those who wish to desert will find it easy. We'll give them a liaison officer, of course, someone senior enough to smooth Kiely's feathers, but why not give them a drillmaster, too? I doubt Lord Kiely would like a certain major of our acquaintance. Och, I cannot think they'll take to each other, my lord, no. Good. Give the puppets Richard Sharpe. Allez vite. They're pulling out. Sir. Not with our wagons they're not. Rifles! Allez. Merde! If they move, shoot 'em! Yes, sir. Pat! Hagman, Moore, Bradshaw! Make a picket down the road, but be ready to come back if the bastards come back for more. Aye, sir. Sir! What is it, Jenkins? Who'd do such a thing? Harris! Sir? There's two Frogs in that ban. Find out what unit they're from and why they're here. Yes, sir! Well? They belong to Brigade Loup, Wolf Brigade, named after their commanding officer, Brigadier General Guy Loup. "Loup" is French for "wolf". Well, we all know what to do with wolves. Stand to. Lads. It's a parley. I am Brigadier General Guy Loup of His Imperial Majesty's Army. Sharpe. Major Sharpe. South Essex. I don't take gifts from murderers. You have two of my men. Forget 'em. They are dead? They will be. Soon. Might I remind you, Major, of the rules of war? Killing babies and young children? Raping young girls? What you did here isn't war. I police these mountains. The chief weapon of the guerrilla, Major, is horror. Horror. So I make sure that I am more horrible than my enemy. No more of my men will die in this godforsaken place. They will if I find them. You should not be so quick with your threats, my friend. You fight me. You will lean caution. Now, my men, if you please. - Sergeant Harper. - Sir. Bring the Frogs out. You're being sensible. It's good. Sergeant Harper. Put 'em up against the wall. I want a firing squad. Bastardos! Hijos de puta! - Firing party ready, Sergeant? - Sir. I have promised my men, Major, that I would never desert them. Don't make me break my promise. Alors. Their lives for your supplies. We'll get our supplies back and, unlike these two, you'll die hard. You kill my men, Major, you will regret it. Rifles, make ready! Non. Monsieur. Je vous en prie. Fire! You're a dead man, Sharpe. She'll have to come with us, Perkins. Look after her. Do you know her name? Miranda, sir. Admired Miranda. Look after Miranda. Then. Erm... sir. Were you supposed to do that? You. Sir. Get out of the road. Don't just sit and gawp, damn your eyes. Do as I say! Get out of the bloody road. Are you deaf, sir? I said. - Get out of the road. - Go round. - Do you know who I am? - I know what you are. And unless you want knocking on your arse, you'll go round. Who's this lot, then? Toy soldiers, Pat. Fresh out of the box by the look of them. Now, would you look at them. I just pity the poor bastard that has to lick them into shape. My new command, my lord? The Real Compa?ia Irlandesa, Sharpe. You know what that is? The Spanish King's bodyguard, sir? Just so. Just so. From His Most Catholic Majesty, King Ferdinand VII. You're going to turn them into soldiers. - You can take your Greenjackets to help. - Take 'em where, my lord? Alona. Not very comfortable, but it's not meant to be. They've had an easy life, Sharpe, sat on their rumps at Escoriah all day. They're soft. If they're going to be any use to me, they need toughening up. Don't spare the rod. Come down on them as hard as you like. Give them hell. That's all. Yes, sir. Come on. Then. All up. Quick march. Colonel Runciman will act as liaison officer between you and Lord Kiely. Runciman? Wagon Master General Runciman? Ex-Wagon Master General. You'll find him in town, at the Rat And Harlot, most like. Have you ever dealt with a royal bodyguard before, Richard? Oh, aye. In India. The Tippoo Sultan's bodyguard. I dealt with them all right. Big buggers they were, and he were nowt but a fat little pig, but he died harder than the rest of them put together. You killed him? Oh, aye. I killed him, all right. Capital, capital. We're sending a regicide to take on a royal bodyguard. Colonel Runciman? - Major Sharpe, sir. - Oh. There's a hunchbacked bitch somewhere about here who serves food. If you see her, tell her I want some more bread and cheese. Ah, there she is. Stop her. Trip her if you have to. I can't imagine why. Si, se?or. She's an ugly-looking whore, ain't she? Well, sit ye down, Sharpe. Sit ye down. Will you have some wine? Ohh. Better. Better. Let the effusions out, Sharpe. That's what my doctor says. Now, then, Sharpe, this is a chance in a thousand, what? Upon my soul, it is. A veritable chance. Know what real? means, Sharpe? , "Royal", sir. So, you're not completely uneducated, eh, Sharpe? Eh? Aye. Royal. Indeed. The Royal Guard, not some pack of stinking mule drivers. They have royal connections, and that means royal rewards. Yes, sir. A reward for a job well done, eh, Sharpe? I mean, God alone knows what London might cough up. A knighthood? Order of the Bath? Damn it, even a viscountcy. - And why not, eh? Why not? - Se?or. Some more wine, you brown-skinned slut! - Si. Se?or. - You see. There's only one problem. Sharpe, the fly in our unguent is that these royal guards are Irish. Have you ever commanded the Irish. Sharpe? A few, sir. Yes. Well, I've been ordering these buggers about ever since they amalgamated the Train with the Irish Corps of Wagoners. Believe me, there ain't nothing I don't know about 'em. You know what the trouble with the Teagues is, Sharpe? No, sir. They don't understand their own good luck. I mean, we go and we sort out their country. And all they do is froth at the maw and throw brickbats at us. There's no gratitude, Sharpe. None. But. Still. We have to be diplomatic. Eh? We have to treat these chaps as if they're English. Well, almost English. - A fair number of my fellows are Irish, sir. - Oh. They would be. Sharpe. They would be. I mean, a third of this damn army is Irish, Sharpe. God, if there was ever a mutiny... It don't bear thinking about, do it? - No, sir. - No. By God. It don't. Now, Sharpe, thump 'em! Thump 'em hard. It's the only cure for papism, or else... a burning at the stake. I mean, that was what my father said, and he was a bishop, Sharpe, so he understood these things. Yes, sir. Oh, there's just one more thing. I would prefer it if you didn't call me Colonel Runciman. After all, I was Wagon Master General. So, it ought to be General Runciman. Have your men do the same, eh? Of course, General. Ah. - Good afternoon to you, Colonel. - Munro. I was just saying to Sharpe here, I was, as you know ...Wagon Master General. Of course. Of course. I apologize for not observing that common courtesy myself. No, Wagon Master, if you'll excuse us, the Irish Company is waiting for Major Sharpe to lead it to Alona. Hold arms! Cake fouling the barrel. No flint. No dog-head screw. Did you ever fire this musket? No, sir. - Have you ever fired a musket? - Once, sir. One day. If you wanted to kill somebody with this gun, you'd have to beat them over the head with it. Mind you, you're big enough for that, aren't you? - What's your name, soldier? - O'Rourke, sir. O'Rourke? And where would you be from, O'Rourke? - My dad's from Galway, sir, but I was bon... - Ah, Galway. That's nice. I'm from Donegal myself. Do you know what else I am, O'Rourke? - No, sir. - Eyes front! I'm ashamed and disgusted, so I am, that an Irishman can't keep his gun in half-decent order. You wouldn't kill an Englishman with that, never mind a bloody Frenchman! What the hell do you think you're doing? Making an inspection. Haven't you leaned to ask a commanding officer's permission before inspecting his men? When I got here, there were no officers, and until I'm introduced to an officer, there still won't be no officers. Damn your impudence, sir! I am the Earl of Kiely, Colonel of the Real Compa?ia Irlandesa. Major Richard Sharpe. South Essex. Lord Wellington has chosen me to be your tactical adviser. Drill Sergeant, you mean? I give lessons in killing, too. Lord Kiely wants you to know that my job is to teach you how to be soldiers. Not parade-ground soldiers, but battlefield soldiers. Look at it. A piece of lumber. You couldn't fire the thing in a month of Fridays, but you can still kill with it. And the best person to kill on a battlefield is always the enemy officer. Remember that. Kill them first, then the sergeants, and after that you can kill any poor bastard you want. But... if you've shot your ball... ...then what you do is turn the musket and club the buggery out of the horse's mouth. I guarantee the horse will throw its rider, and when the overpaid, overdressed monkey sitting on it hits the turf, you can finish him off while he's still stunned. - Have you ever seen that done, Sergeant? - I've seen it done well, sir. - Have you ever done it yourself? - More times than I can count. And were they all Frog officers? Of course they weren't. We've killed officers in blue coats, red coats, even officers in white coats, because h don't care what army an officer fights for. What color coat he wears or what king he serves. A bad officer is better off dead, and a good soldier had better lean how to kill him. - Ain't that right, Sergeant Harper? - Right as rain, sir. Listen hard, gentlemen. I know every skiving, dishonest, malingering army trick there is. How's that? Because I started off where you did, in the ranks. Remember that. My name is Sharpe, Major Sharpe, and I'm going to teach you to be soldiers. Steady. Steady. - Are you all right, ma'am? - Yes, I... - Here, she's fainted. - I'll get Ramona. Loosen her clothes. Let her breathe. - Me? - I'm going to fetch water. Oh, hell. Ben? Ben? Who... Who are you? Major Sharpe, ma'am, at your service. What happened? Where am I? Why have you undressed me? You were thrown from the coach, ma'am, and fell into a swoon. I was told to er... loosen your clothes. Where's my husband? You're married to one of the officers, ma'am? I'm married to Lord Kiely. Lord Kiely isn't here. He didn't ride ahead of us? He said he'd meet me here. - Perhaps his intention is to join you later, m'lady. - Yes. Yes, that must be what he intends. If you will excuse me, Lady Kiely, Ramona will look after you now. Right. Come on. You lads. - I want this stuff over here. - All right. All right. - We're doing it as fast as we can. - Move yourselves. Don't break your heart and me with it. OK. We're off. Rifles! - Thanks, Dan. - Practice makes perfect. - Well, now, there's a thing. - I reckon she's sweet on you. Oh, leave off, Dan. - Hs that for anything? - Come here. - There has to be an easier way than this, lads. - Oh, give it here. Where are you going to now, for Jesus' sake? - What do you think of these Paddies, then? - I know what Mr. Sharpe'll make of them. Bloody mincemeat. Find the middle of it. - Ah, Jesus! - Don't stand on it. Look out up there, all right? Look at it. I've seen hovels better built than this shit heap. Well, I'll tell you, if any bastard attacks us from this end, we'll get overrun. Yeah. Let's have a standing picket 50 yards out. If any bugger comes, I want to know about it. Right. Come on with you. Come on, now. Brady? Brady? Donaju? - Here. O'Rourke? Here. Murphy PD? Murphy FG? Murphy FF? All right. Let's make this very easy. Who is here? I am! Where the hell have they all got to? Hell's just about right, sir. O'Brien? O'Dell? Why were we put here, Major? - Here, my lord? - You know what I mean, so near to the border. It's a damned invitation for the men to run. Is that what Wellington wants? What do you want? I want to fight. Then you've come to the right place. See that track? You march your lads up there and I'll guarantee you a fight. The Frogs'll love it. It'll be easier for them than fighting choirboys. What do you want of your men? Suicide? If necessary. You're mad, my lord. Would you call Roland's defense of Roncesvalles suicide? Did Leonidas' Spartans do nothing but throw away their lives? Sometimes, a great name can come only from a grand gesture. No wonder your boys are deserting. I would, too. If I take a man into battle, I like to offer him a better-than-evens chance he'll march away from it. Riders approaching. Frenchies. So, what's he doing, Sharpe? Offering single combat. He has a fancy to die famous, so he has. The point! The point beats the edge. Use the point, sir. Eh, Sharpe? Go on! Finish it. Finish the bastard. You bloody fool. What's happening? He's a dead 'un, sir. Monsieur. God save you, sir. Bravo. Bravo Sharpe, is that... Is she... I mean, is it... - It's a woman, General. - A woman?! Good God! Ah. General?simo Runciman, no? I am Do?a Juanita de Elia. So, ma'am, have you come far? From Vitoria. What's your business here? - You. Must. Be Sharpe... - Major Sharpe, aye. Yes, Munro said you had no manners. - Munro? - I work with the partisans in these mountains. Major Munro asked me to attach myself to your camp while you're here. Madam, allow me to name the Colonel, Lord Kiely. Bravo, my lord. Bravo. You are a good swordsman. I am in your debt. It was nothing, ma'am. Ben, you're unharmed? Thank you, madam. I am quite well. You see, Sharpe? You see? A man can fight in the old ways. War doesn't have to be sordid. That man died for nothing, just as your death would have been meaningless. For nothing, Sharpe? Listen! Do you not hear? I just gave them a victory. And you're going to stop 'em deserting. Ben. Loose as a good woman, soldier. Button it up. I hear from Jenkins that we've lost some of the Irish, Sharpe. 12 of them flew the coop last night. Good God, man. What the hell do you think you're doing? In two weeks, we won't have a soul left. - After Kiely's show, I wouldn't give us two days. - What do you mean? There's a wolf in these hills, General. I can smell him. A wolf? Brigadier Loup. Oh, yes. Yes. Do you think he'll come here? Oh, yes, he'll come. It's just a matter of when. I can't hold him off with a few Chosen Men. If the Irish boys had decent muskets... You know how thin our supply lines are stretched, Sharpe. - It can't be done. It can't be done. - We need muskets. Enough muskets, powder, ammunition was in those supply wagons you were sent to escort... ...to arm the Irish Company twice over, but you don't got 'em, Sharpe, do you? No, I don't, but I will. They're our wagons. Right enough. What do you reckon? It's quiet. Too quiet. If you ask me. Maybe they're out on patrol. We've caught Loup with his breeches down. Come on. Sentinelle, debout. Il est mort. It's time we weren't here. Harris! Perkins! Allez. En garde. En garde! Allez! Allez! Go on. Go on. Jenkins! Sir? Can you get these buggers out? I'll try, sir. Rifles! Stand ready to give Lieutenant Jenkins covering fire. Sharpe, what are you doing? We're pulling back. No! No retreat. We stand and fight. We're outgunned, outnumbered. We must withdraw. Irish Company, stand firm. Jenkins, get them out of this bloody rat-trap. Do it! Irish Company, to me! Fall back! Fall back! Keep on running. Tirez! - Colonel Kiely, withdraw, sir! - No! You must withdraw. He's a mad bastard, so he is. Sir, we must go. All! My... All! My leg. Jesus. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go! Retraite. - Why don't they pursue? - Because they don't have to. We had them. We should have stayed and fought. We had them. We had nothing. We got away with our lives. Now, be grateful for that. How many? 17 dead. Four wounded. The luck of the Irish. Major. Something you ought to see. Look at 'em. Your brave Irish deserters. The French believe there are two kinds of people in Spain. Those who are for them and those who are against. They've found you now, and they're wondering what you are. And until they find the answers, they'll treat you like an enemy... ...which leaves you three choices. You can run east and have your manhood sliced off by the Frogs. You can run west and risk being shot by my army for deserting. Or you can stay here and you can lean how to be soldiers. We are soldiers. Soldiers? Shall I tell you what the rest of this army thinks of you, including the Connaught Rangers and the Enniskillen Dragoons? They think you're soft. You're all right for guarding a piss-pot in a palace, but no good for a fight. But that's all going to change, because one day you and I are going to go into battle... ...real battle, and when we do, you're going to have to be good. Bloody good. There's a French bastard in these mountains called Loup. It were his men you ran into today. And it were him as did this to your mates. Now, you can die like gelded dogs or you can show him that there ain't a French regiment in the world that can stand up to the Irish. It's your choice. Yes! Major, I'm to dine with Munro tonight. I'd like you to join us. I can't. Things need seeing to. Do?a Juanita needs an escort. - Why don't you escort her? - I have to take my wife. I know Wellington doesn't want the Real Compa?ia, else why put us out here? Look, I took you to be one of his lackeys, set to add to our misery, but what you said to the men about making them a regiment to be proud of... I hate making bloody speeches. No, they were good words, Sharpe. That's what I want, too, for every man jack of them. They're decent lads. I know, and you can make 'em decent soldiers. More than decent. I haven't your experience. Sharpe. You handled that Crapaud well enough, and from the saddle. I couldn't have done that. Where did you serve before the Irish Company? The Real Compa?ia is my first commission. - But you have fought before? - He was my first. My compliments. I want to make things right between us. Come to dinner tonight as my guest. Say you will. He's a decent fellow. But for Sharpe, I wouldn't be here now. Well, we have much to thank him for. Indeed. There. No. - No, I cannot. - Ben. Please? Forgive me. Please! Look out. Keep your eyes open. Lads. These lads wanted to see you. It's about this, sir. There are children being murdered by English dragoons. And women dragged out of their houses by grenadiers. Ht says the River Erne is blocked with bodies at Belleek. Cromwell's ghost has come again to drench Ireland in blood. This is an American newspaper. Since when have the Americans had a good word to say about the British? - Trouble in Ireland? We'd have heard. - There's been rumors. There's always bloody rumors! How many drafts have come from Ireland in the last month? I don't know, sir. Well, I do. Not one of them thought to tell us about his mother being buggered by a dragoon. Yet, all of a sudden, some American newspaper knows all about it. I heard about it, sir. - It doesn't make sense. - Not everything in this world has to make sense. Yes, it does, Pat. That's how you and me live. We're practical men, not bloody dreamers. These are lies, right? Right. So, let's get back to bloody work. Not you, Pat. I've got enough troubles without you tuning moody on me. Everybody expects me to solve their bloody problems. For God's sake, give me some help. I always do. Yeah, I know you do. God help us if Loup comes now. We'll be caught like rats in a ring, which is just what Wellington wants. What? Well, he hasn't said as much, but he doesn't trust your Irishmen, him nor Munro. They want 'em out of the way. I'm meant to help get rid of the bastards, but I like 'em, damn it. I like 'em. Among the partisans, Mungo is known as Se?or Munro! The training is going well, my lord? Indeed, Munro. Major Sharpe was an excellent choice for drillmaster. I thank you for it. But you're still losing men over the wall, I hear. I think Major Sharpe and I have solved that particular problem. Haven't we. Major? I think we have, sir. And how are you finding life at Alona, m'lady? Different from Madrid, I'll wager. It is not altogether disagreeable. I was surprised you'd bring her out here. The field's no place for a lady. No. I did suggest to her that she remain in Madrid, but er... she would not. My place is at Benedict's side. Other wives follow their husbands into the field. Why should I not do the same? - Because you could be his death. - What do you mean by that, madam? A man in battle does not need to be worrying about his wife. He has burdens enough with his rifle and pack. I don't agree. - Really, Major? A man should always have his wife nearby to remind him just what he's fighting for. You fight for King George, don't you, Sharpe? You should have stayed at home in Madrid. You could have filled your days with embroidery and, well, whatever it is gentlefolk do at home. At home in Ireland, madam, I ran my father's estate. Do?a Juanita meant no offence, Lucy. Apologize for being sharp. Ben? Apologize, madam, damn it. My apologies, madam. Ah, Se?or Munro, I never like to be with a man who is more handsome than me. It's a bit gusty tonight. We don't want to see the Se?ora's skirt being blown high. God knows why she came. Munro's instructions. She has partisans in the mountains, so she says, though I've yet to see them. I meant the farmer's daughter, Sharpe. My wife. Your wife's a lady. Oh, now, yes. The farmer's daughter. Good breeding stock... ah! She married me for my name, do you see? And what did you marry her for? Money No. No, that's not true. I loved her once, but she lost a child. Six months since. - And you slight her for that? - Do not judge what you cannot understand. I'm the last of my blood, Sharpe. When I die, the name dies with me. Perhaps next time. No. No, I... I thought to try, but... No. I could not face that again. It was her child, too. Yes. - Good night, sir. - Donaju. Ah, Richard! There you are. I didn't like to ask in front of Kiely, but how are you getting on with those Irish laddies? Well enough. I hear there's mischief. Oh, aye? Where did you hear that from? Your good friend the Do?a Juanita? She might have mentioned something. Is that why she's here, to spy on me? You trust 'em? Before I'd ever trust you. I was sent here to train soldiers and that's what I'm doing. I'll make them the best damn fighters in the British Army. That is what you want, isn't it? A dangerous game you're playing, Richard. You and Wellington sent the Irish Company here to die. Fair enough. That's your business. But if you're including me in that number, then I'm not about to die without a fight. Nobody wants you to die, Richard... ...unnecessarily. But watch your step, hm? It's good advice. I must talk with you. Major Sharpe. She is with him, isn't she? With who? Do?a Juanita. She is with my husband? I'm sure not. You are a poor liar. I beg you. Major. My husband respects you. If you have any influence over him, please urge him to stop this... ...foolishness. It is not my place to interfere. Your husband is a fool. - He is a romantic. - The same thing in my book. You are my only hope, Major Sharpe. I have pleaded with him to give her up, but he will not. I can offer you little in return for such a favor, but... If you wish... ...h will spend the night with you. Treat me like the lowest Marseille whore and I will not complain. Only, I implore you... ...intercede on my behalf with Ben. I am too plain for you? No. You're another man's wife. I will do what I can, when I can, if I can. But I do it for you, not for your husband. And there is no charge. Thank you, Major. Good night, m'lady. Sharpe, do you see anything? No. But he's out there somewhere, waiting for his moment. Well, let him come, eh? We're armed and ready for him now. We're armed. I don't know about ready. Then make us ready, Sharpe. Make us ready. I mean to. Gentlemen, draw the cartridge from your pouch. Bite off the ball. Prime your pan. Drop the butt. Pour the remainder of the powder down the barrel. And spit in the bullet. Draw your ramrod now. Draw it and push it down. Please remember to take out the ramrod. Gentlemen. Because if you fire at the French. I might ask you to fetch it back. If Loup comes. This is where he'll attack, where the wall's weakest. Right, Sharpe. Right, lads. One, two, three. Heave-ho! Bite. Prime. Pour. Spit. Good God! What the hell does she think she's doing? Being a good wife. I don't see the Do?a Juanita getting her hands dirty, do you? Come on. Pull! Come on. Turn 'em out. Keep it moving there. Now. Lash it down tightly, now. - Hot work, Sergeant. - It's going to get very hot. Very hot. Aim. Fire! Wait for it. Wait for the word. Fire! Reload. There you are. Fire. Right. Watch Harris and Perkins. Front rank. Make ready. Come on. Get a move on. Second rank, make ready... Bite. Prime. Pour. Spit. Ram. Cock. Fire. Front rank. Make ready Fire. Well? Not bad... for Irishmen. Pull! Over this way. Come on. Put it on the top there. I thought it would be of more use than embroidery. Indeed it is. - All right, Perkins, lad. Don't eat her. - No, sir. First passion, m'lady. Yes. All the women and children are to billet in the barrack block tonight for safety's sake. Very well. I'm afraid there's few comforts and little privacy... A soldier's wife must expect privations. Oh. Ramona! It's nothing. It's nothing. I... I felt a little faint. - Are you ill, m'lady? - No. It was just... For a minute... The heat... It?s passed Careful over there. Let Ramona take you to your quarters, m'lady. No. Really. I... Leave her to me. I can manage. There's no sign of Loup in the hills. - Who says? - I do. I have just returned from there now. - He's there, all right. - I told you and I will tell Munro. Just because you've not seen him doesn't mean he isn't there. - Where's Lady Kiely? - Oh, she is resting. She'll be all right? Yeah. She's going to have a baby. A baby? How do you know? Know - Did she tell you? - I've got eyes. But... Are you sure? If Ramona says she's going to have a baby, she's going to have a baby. Here I sit on Butternut Hill Who can blame me crying my fill? Every tear would turn a mill Johnny is gone for a soldier I'll sell my rock I'll sell my reel I'll even sell my spinning wheel To buy my love a coat of steel Johnny is gone for a soldier... Are you all right, Jenkins? Jenkins! Are you all right? I was thinking on those poor deserters, sir. You'll have chance to avenge them before long. Vengeance is the Lord's prerogative. Well, he ain't here right now, so we'll have to do. I was educated for a parson, you know, sir God knows how I'll ever repent tuning soldier. I need you to stand firm, Jenkins. There'll be time enough to repent when the killing's done. Yes, sir. Sharpe! Sharpe! - Do you read, Sharpe? - Yes, General. Look at this. It's a bad business, by God. Damn it. It's a bad business. It's another report. More trouble from Ireland. Bloody rebels making mischief. Troops fighting back. Women and children dead. It could mean trouble here, Sharpe. Where are these bloody papers getting it from? God knows, but if the Irish troops got to hear of it... Why don't you get to your bed, General? Can't, Sharpe. Can't. What if Loup comes? I'm a general, damn it. I've got to lead the men, Sharpe. Anything happens, I'll wake you. Will you, Sharpe? Will you? You're a decent man, Sharpe. I didn't think I'd take to you at first, but you're not as stupid as you hook. Bed, eh? Well, perhaps an hour won't harm, eh? - Night. Sharpe. - Night, sir. Wrap your legs round me and dig in with your heels For the closer we get, love, the better it feels Halt! Who goes there? Major Sharpe. South Essex. - All well, Donaju? - Very quiet, sir. I hear there's another report come in. I hope you've put your lads straight. Yeah, well. You know how it is, sir. It gets them in the heart, so it does. Some of the lads are saying we shouldn't be fighting for England at all. If the French come, you won't be fighting for England, you'll be fighting for your lives. I thought you should know, sir, is all. Bugler! Sound the alarm! Ah, mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! The blessings of God on you, sir. Jenkins, fall back! Irish Company, fall back! Fall back! Compa?ia Irlandesa. Form two ranks. Second rank, cock. Fire. Reload. Front rank, fire. Second rank, fire! Front rank, fire. Fire! Fire! Fire. Fire! Fire! Yeah! Perkins. Shift your arse. There's work to be done. If we counterattack now, we can destroy Loup once and for all. - The men need sleep. - They can sleep the rest of the day out. If we march tonight, we can move on Loup at dawn. Very well. - Can I count on your partisans? - Of course. So, we're agreed? - Agreed. - Agreed. Good plan, Sharpe. My lord. Will you insult me even now? Go back to your quarters, madam. I would speak with you privately. Whatever you might have to say, you can say here. Very well. I am carrying your child. What? Are you so taken with jealousy that you must come up with this nonsense? - It's not nonsense. - Mind your business. Ask Ramona. Your wife has been having fainting fits since she arrived here. It's the air. Ht's her condition. Sir. Is it true, Lucy? I did not tell you before for fear I might be wrong. Major Sharpe, you'll have my wife escorted back to Passages. - I want to stay with you. - Do not argue, Lucy. You must go home today. Damn it, I will not lose another child. See to it, Major. - Absolument? - Absolument. You should have... You should have confided in me, Lucy. - Well, I... - My dear, I did not want to give you false hope. Not until I was certain all was well. I knew how much this would mean to you. But... When? The last time, when you laid with me... ...for comfort. - And you've known? - No. Not known. Hoped. Prayed. You're certain? Yes. - I... - Hush, now. - Hush. - I've... You see... Juanita... I'll give her up. I will. Lucy, forgive me. Forgive me. Goodbye, Major Sharpe. Thank you for all your kindness. Goodbye, m'lady. You will watch over Ben? Yes. And you look after yourself. - Look after her, Jenkins. - Of course I will, sir. Goodbye, my darling. Miranda! Miranda! Miranda! Miranda! - Is everything all right? - Why have we stopped? - Have that. No. No! Murdering English bastard! Stop it! What do you think you're doing? Shut it, you English whore. - I'll see you hang for this. - You'll regret that. You'll regret it for a long time. I'm taking you to a man who knows how to treat bitches like you. When it comes to my turn, you'll wish you were dead. Do?a Juanita promised me five hundred. When I have Sharpe. My husband will come. And when he does, he will kill you. Oh, yes. Mm. Of course. The Lord Kiely. No, my lady. He will not kill me. He and his men will help me defeat the English, because I have you You do not know my husband. But I do. I know, for example... ...that he prefers darker meat than yours. How will you pass your time until he arrives? In pleasure or in pain? I am carrying my husband's child, sir. So? No! What will you do with that, my lady, hm? Kill me? You will not defile me, sir. On my child's life, you will not. I will do it, as God sees me. My men will show you to your chamber. You haven't seen Miranda, have you, sarge? Maybe she's run off with one of the Irish Company. They've nice uniforms. So they have. - Nice enough to tun a young girl's head. - She ain't like that, sarge. Don't tease him, Patrick. He's found his true love, sarge. Isn't that right? Yes, sarge, I have. Then God bless you, Perkins. Go and find her, lad. Juanita, we must talk. Yes, we must. The attack on Loup's town. There is to be a slight change of plan. A change of plan? After Sharpe leaves us tomorrow, you must order the Irish Company not to attack. Why the hell should I tell the men not to attack? Because Loup's got your wife. If you order the Irish Company to attack, she dies. How do you know this? My Good Why, Juanita? Why? A humiliation for the English. You are Napoleon's gift to himself. And if one Irish regiment deserts, why not the others? And Sharpe? It's bloody quiet, Pat. Look out! To me! To me! Allez! The bastards knew we were coming. Best wan Kiely. This is bloody hopeless, sarge. - I know it, lad. - We're surrounded. All the streets are cut off. For Christ's sake, will you shut up and let me think? Otherwise we're all dead men. - What's going on? - We're waiting. What for? My men are being cut to ribbons at the gate and you bastards are sat on your arses! - Shift yourselves! - We're surrendering to Loup. - What? - We're damned if we're going to fight for a side that's been slaughtering our families. We've all read the papers. You wanted to make a name for yourself. Well, you've made one now. You turncoat bastard! Kill him. Kill him, you fool. I'll do it myself. Jesus. Jesus. - It's all here. A massacre in Galway. - What's the date on them? - The 11th, sir. - And today? The 12th. These weren't printed in America. No clipper could have crossed the Atlantic in a day. Major Sharpe is right. Juanita was distributing them for the French. - You knew that?! - My wife, damn it! My wife. Loup's holding her. She said unless I did as they asked, they would kill Lucy. Loup's made you look bloody stupid. Are you going to stand for that? Are you? Cos I'm not. I'm going to kill a wolf. Am I going to have to do it alone? No! I promised you a battle and now I'm giving you one. Come on! Sarge! Don't shoot. Don't shoot. The Irish Company. Sergeant. They're never going to make it. Perkins! Irish Company, to me. Quick! Inside. No. No! Rifles, to me! - Easy. - It hurts. Christ Almighty! Take it easy, lad. Give him air, lads. Give him air. - I'm sorry, sarge. - You're going to be all right, lad. - Rest easy. Rest easy. - Dan! Dan? - Aye? - Are you there? A tune. A tune, Dan. Mother? Your mother's with you, lad. Mothers never leave you. I'm sorry, sarge. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Nobody touches O'Rourke. The bastard's mine. - Do you hear? Yes. Sarge. O'Rourke! O'Rourke! Fire! Fire! Loup! O'Rourke! I'll find you, O'Rourke! Sergeant Harper. Sure, I've no quarrel with a fellow Irishman. A good soldier always looks after his weapon, boy. O'Rourke, this one's for Perkins! This one's for Ireland. And this one, this one's for me! You stupid bastard! Lucy! Benedict! - Lucy, my dear, they have not harmed you? - No. Ben! Lucy! No o You have killed me, sir. You bastard. When you made me break my promise, I made another one. I swore to kill you. No I shall make good my promise. And I swore you'd die hard, you bastard. You hear that, Loup? You've lost. You were beaten by a palace guard. Get over there. Come on. Shift your arses, you French dogs, unless you want a taste of Irish steel. Special mention should be given to Rifleman Perkins, my lord. And Kiely? Lord Kiely led the attack and died bravely, fighting Brigadier Loup. A small number of the Irish Company, led by guardsman O'Rourke, proved to be anfrancesado , as did the Do?a Juanita, but they were dealt with. My lord. Yes. Well, the Prince Regent has sent his congratulations. Baron Runciman now, I understand, my lord. If you're hoping for anything. You'll be disappointed. - You're lucky you're not facing a court of inquiry. - On what charge? On any charge I damn well please. I made you, Sharpe, and I can break you just as easily. Remember that. Yes, my lord. You survived, then, Richard. It's what I do best. No thanks to you. What do you mean? You suspected Juanita was anfrancesado, didn't you? You put all your rotten apples into Alona for me to sort out. You're a suspicious fellow, Richard, and no mistake. And you're a Scots bastard. I came to say goodbye, m'lady. Thank you, Major. Do they know? About Ben? Yes, m'lady. They know he died bravely and was loyal to the end. His honor and yours are safe. God bless you, Major Sharpe. I doubt if he will, m'lady. He knows me too well by now. You do not despise him, even though he tried to mutiny? If you were my wife, I think I'd have done the same. He loved you full well, m'lady, and I cannot blame him for that. Goodbye, Richard. Goodbye, m'lady. Walk on. Walk. Walk. Does anybody want to say anything? Yes. He was a brave soldier? ...and she was his lass. Rifles! Make ready Fire!
