I know every trick in the book. Look, the contract doesn't take effect for 10 more days Xie, I know... I know how much that piece of stone is worth. Okay, look, I'll buy that too. What you really want is my land. If I pay off my debt to you, then I don't have to sell it. You think that makes any difference? You'll still be left with just an empty shell. Who says it's an empty shell? There are 200 workers in our factory. That's 200 mouths waiting to be fed! If you don't feed them, they'll turn around and devour you! These days you can't even trust your own son. Wolves eat meat, dogs eat shit. Survival of the fittest. Work with me...
