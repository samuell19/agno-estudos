Comrade, please calm down.. Then like the other party, let us too be meek and spineless.. First,it was not deliberately let loose! Second, Varkey helps us in times of need True! He never keeps me waiting at his shop Third, by evening, all of us can... What nonsense is this? Listen, we will catch the buffalo.. We catch wild buffalos So local buffalos are nothing to us! You can get lost! Beat them up.. Yes, sir.. I had heard about it, sir But sir, what can we do about it? Sir... SIR Sir... Right from morning, these rogues start creating trouble.. Stop and buy a pack of minikkutti.. Let them butcher, barter or bait the buffalo But why place all this trouble on me? Do you know how much I have lost? Bro, can I have tea? Why tea? I will serve you arrack! This is too much For generations, Varkey has been our supplier for meat But this is happening for the first time You and your bloody traditions and generations Your ancestors left their homes and migrated here... either due to poverty or their illegal activities Varkey's family comes from an ancient one Bullshit Varkey's father fled after seducing his wife's bedridden sister Is that so? I didn't know! Since he couldn't buy any land here he started butchering buffaloes That is in the past People didn't have money to buy meat everyday At most, one buffalo a month That's all Now, listen up Fill your stomach with those snacks But you must pay the bill, okay? Once, on Easter eve a buffalo broke free People caught and killed it and shared the meat But Mapilla was found two days later He was lying dead in a well He was running after the buffalo - Run, he did Why wash dirty linen? We must call Kuttachan Look at him! He's really had it Varkey dude, how are you? Feeling just heavenly! You get drunk, jump fences - without a care for the buffaloes No wonder it turned out like this Better go to hospital The Poomala hooligans are fermenting trouble Do something fast Or it will get worse Let Kuttachan come and shoot it down Now we need only him to add to the ruckus Varkey, let Kuttachan come. He will find a way You've scores to settle What did i do ? Let me see if I can catch the buffalo without him Then go and do so Why are you sitting numb? Stop your blabbering He can't even hang on To the buffalo's tail It's not as easy as your silly fishing Sunny, go call Kuttachan You move aside Omana dear, it is me Kuttachan? When did you land? Just now Prepare chicken for me, I'll come by in the evening Hurrah, hurrah, Kuttachan! Varkey, what happened? Look, Kuttacha Not mere Kuttachan, But Ganja Kuttachan!

Come, let us go in my car No need It's not a big deal abroad! Let's apply to the government for permission to hunt After Sunday Mass, we go with our guns There are enough deers and boars.. Don't go for a big shoot If your wife sends you back from abroad you'll roam around here weeding cardamom Have coffee.. There is no meat for dinner I will see to it This is Johnson You also came to know that? It has destroyed everything. There is chaos around the church Not if it comes from a freezer. If fresh meat, get me 3 kilos If local pig, 2 kilos Come over. Kuttachan has arrived Now, it's a different ball game Come Hurrah, hurrah, Kuttachan! My god! Scared?

We must go to Elappara tomorrow Bro, my meat.. Wait, man They say it's a huge one.

Or he may knock you down Where? There, look there Come here Come up, fast Give me that knife This is the rubber estate. It won't go beyond The canal on that side is in full spate Two men should keep watch there. Two men, yes? This is the granite quarry Beyond that? Owned by the Kalladanthi family I will be there Near the quarry? - Yes Playing hopscotch? None of your business. Get lost What will you do if I don't? Come, let's go Come on Kuttan bro.. Yes, tell me... Were you caught by the police for smuggling sandalwood? Yes. I was betrayed by that scum Kuttacha, you should go to church once in a while I haven't even been there even for baptism But there are certain advantages Did you get me? Have it Here is the pickle. I will take it So, now they are bold enough to cut sandalwood Even from the church compound? What a job they've done After all, why does a church need sandalwood? If it was a temple, I could understand How will dung-worms like you understand? There is only one sandal smuggler here Stealing sandalwood from church? He is farming ganja too Xavi, leave your wife alone and come down There There it goes Where did it go? Why the hell are you following me? Damnit! I was about to catch it! Get lost.

Take the bike and get lost Take the bike. Scram! What's going on? Move aside Move It's quite common. Cattles often fall into wells But, it won't fall on its own Move aside, you brat - I'm the one who trapped it Varkey, shall I finish it off? Go ahead If I catch the beast, I know how to kill it too Better finish him off now Who the hell are you to decide? Can't I express my opinion? Look, it will get sunk in mud What's wrong with you? We can shoot it and bring it up It was I who ran after it from morning Everyone here knows I trapped it Now, if anyone wants kill or butcher it... Why are all of you here? To claim your share? The moment they hear a buffalo is on the run, they rush in with chillies and spices! You Poomala guys, are you here for your share? Did he actually trap it? 'When you get hold of the rooster...' 'Tear off the feathers It's time for chicken curry!' 'When you get hold of the rooster...' 'Tear off the feathers It's time for chicken curry!' Now soak it 'Back home in Poomala, When we chew tobacco...' 'Auntie would yell at us.' 'Back home in Poomala, When we chew tobacco...' 'Auntie would yell at us.' Freezing cold! Like in a forest This was once a forest Are you joking? This, a forest! You brat, when were you born? When did you start wearing shirt and trousers? When my father came here first Even the bullock carts came only upto Petta From there, they had to walk, climb and clamour.. And when they reached, it was full of elephants and porcupines, For fear of bears, they dare not step out My dad made a big Cross And placed it on top of the hill Then he gathered all the men and women And started digging, ploughing and planting Even now, with us here, this place belongs to animals Look there at those men They may move around on two legs But they are beasts Come on, pull it well Where is he? That skunk, Kuttachan? I don't find him here now Sophy is alone there, He must have gone with the gun to her What? Leave me Let me go, you dog! Get in and bolt the door.

Go, give them a hand There are enough people to do it Look, if you get him, shoot him straight in the chest Sure Heave together, heave ho! Gently So, you killed him! He looked after our mother! It could have been killed with a single bullet. This is all your fault. What are you up to? Don’t create a ruckus. It’s a dead man’s house You go home Leave now I swear... He won’t see the next dawn No one gets any share! I will feed him to the dogs Come on, guys If only someone killed that buffalo It is not some goat or cow. It’s a buffalo gone wild! It will tear you apart You suckers are no good. Before daybreak we will kill it and take it home We Poomala people are here now Not only that. We’ll also take it home We’ll fry it in a pan; mix it with tapioca The fire you’ve lit for this buffalo, you can put it out with water You will shit cowdung If you even touch the buffalo we will chop off your limbs Clear them off Or they will wind up dead Stop it! Stop it, I say! Move aside Settle the issue. No point in carrying a gun and stick So, you are the one who decides things here?
