Soap box derby. What's that? You and I are gonna build this sucker and you're gonna race it! Are you telling me you've never heard of the soap box derby? Maybe, sort of. Come on. This is something I always wanted to do as a kid, I just never did it. I kept thinking about it and thinking about it and one day, it was too late. Don't be a dope pop, of course I know what the soap box derby is. It's great, I love it! Merry Christmas buddy. You do know that I lack almost every skill set needed to do this? Not to mention it looks like a lot of work. Let's go page two. Hey buddy. What's goin' on? I thought training was next week got called up. I'm going to the show. Wow... Okay. What about the car? We'll finish it, alright. Faith and courage. There's no greater call to service than to god and country Thomas Caldwell answered both of those with equal shares of dignity and honor. For that he suffered the greatest of sacrifices and paid the harshest of prices. We gather here today to mourn our loss yet celebrate his deliverance into the loving and eternal care of god almighty. Let us bow our heads. Heavenly father we thank you for the gift of Thomas Caldwell. We thank you for the gift that he has been to all those that he knew. We ask you to give strength and courage to his family, to Trey and to Maggie. We ask you to bless all those gathered here today. And we ask all of that through Christ our lord. Amen Does anybody know who he is? Addy he's a writer. A writer. Ok. Does anybody know what books he's written? Sam... Great. Josh... It's okay if you're not ready Trey. We are not going to let you down here, and I personally am not going to lose you. You know why? Because I need your, shall we say, your unique way around my campus. I really don't want to go to summer school. Okay, well we can work something out. Maybe I could home school him or something, catch him up a bit. Or maybe I could. I mean i'm sure there's plenty on your plate already Maggie. You'd do that? I would love nothing more. If it's okay with Trey? Sure, I guess. Trey, I'm the principal here. And you didn't come in with the best grades in this deal and I've got a little pull around here, I can make things happen. So could you sound a little excited for me. Thank you Mrs. Banner. Your welcome. Trey? What happened here? A momentary lapse of judgment I don't know what I'm supposed to do, you know how I'm supposed to feel. Well you just got to do what's right for you. Maybe I should just stay home for a while, you know work on the car. I'm not so sure that's the best call. Yeah, besides I'm going to need a hand on this thing or it will take forever. I can't promise I won't make more of a mess of it than be a help but I'll give you a hand if you want. Higher please! I'm trying, but you've been doing this forever. Alright just put it down, put it down. This is stupid. Just forget it. Well maybe we could prop it up with something. I'll put the paint cans underneath it. Your kidding right? Yeah you got a better idea? Don't make me list them. Oh don't worry I got this. Go for it. There. Really? Yes really. Whoops! Alright, perfect, perfect, perfect almost perfect so tell me what did you do wrong right here? Forgot to carry the three. That, and what else? I don't know doesn't that solve it? It solves the problem, but there's a bigger problem here Trey. Well look you just got lazy at the end it's as if you raced to the finish line and ditched all the basics. So tell me what is the big hurry? I don't know just wanted to get finished. Trey let me ask you something, can I introduce you to somebody? What? Like a kid shrink? No way I'll just slow down. No, no, no. This is a friend of mine, he and his wife, from church. Can I be honest with you? Always. The last thing I want right now is to be preached to. Trey I don't think he's going to be preaching to you. And I think you two are going to hit it off just fine. Heard you the first time talk to me. You Roy? Roy Gibbs? Mac give me a hand here we got a show and tell. Sorry I'm not here for the tour, if that's what you mean. My teacher Mrs. Banner said that I should hook up with you. Yeah boss. It's alright man false alarm. She said we should hook up huh? Is that what she called it? Well you know meet. Ok well what's your name? Trey Caldwell. Trey Caldwell, I'm Roy Gibbs. Nice to meet you. There we met, we hooked, we're done. I guess she thought we might have some stuff in common. Yeah well you see, Evelyn thinks if you stick two broken people in a room you get one good one. Reality is you just get twice the junk. I'm doin' fine. Wow, you mask this stuff worse than me. What's that supposed to mean? Exactly what it sounds like. You're hurting down deep, and the tough guy face you put on is pretty thin. What are you talking about? What, what kind of kid talks like that? You one of those wise guys in school who every time the teacher asks a question you raise your hand up, pick me, I got the answer, pick me! Actually I'm pretty average. Straight c s. Alright, look, yes Evelyn said you might be dropping by, she didn't say why. She said that you were going through a rough time. So tell me what's your big bad story? Well my pop, dad, was an army reservist, he got called up and got killed pretty much as soon as he got there. Afghanistan. My son, who was also a fire fighter, married a gal from new York, moved there and then died a hero on 9/11. Sorry to hear that. Yeah, welcome to the sorry club. Anyway, Evelyn... Saw an opportunity for us to share a common pain and perhaps enter into some kind of father son surrogate relationship in order to deal with our grief. Alright you got to stop that. It just doesn't sound right coming out of a kid's mouth. But yeah, something like that. But listen here's the thing. I’m not interested. I'm sorry about your dad, I really am, but I'm the last guy you need right now. Your dad dying the way he did, my son, just one more reminder that what ever were doing in this country, it ain't working, alright. I get it. I may not share your views because I think america is pretty great, but I get it. Sorry for taking your time. I'll tell Mrs. Banner it didn't work out. Hi, is Roy here? Yeah he's out back. I’m Trey. Audrey. 25 hill? Are you the same Roy Gibbs? I think you are what about it? I'm building a car, soapbox, me and my pop were when he got called up Mrs. Banner didn't put us together so we can cry over our sad stories 25 hill. 25 hill. So it is you. Wow. You're probably thinking the road was all fresh back then, huh, black asphalt, shiny painted lines. Truth is, looked pretty much like this. In fact just like this. Looks like a pretty good hill for a soap box run. You kidding. Perfect hill. Perfect slope. Inch for inch, almost identical to akron. That give you an advantage? When you got there? Well yeah. I ran that race a hundred times, only right here in my own backyard. You think that's why you won? You know for a smart guy you ask a lot of dumb questions. What do you think? I think my pop knew about all this when he bought the car you catch on pretty quick, don't ya? That's a pretty sleek looking ride. Come a long way since I was a kid. Of course we use to build our own back then, none of this kit stuff. So I suppose this is where Mrs. Banner's plan kicks in. I play dad, you play son, we build this thing here together, you race it you win a few races. You go to Ohio, you win the big race there, and we all live happily ever after. Who's the wise guy now. Trey? Oh hello. Mom this is Roy Gibbs, Mrs. Banner's friend. Roy, my mom. Oh yes. Hi Maggie. Hi. Check it out he won the derby. The derby, mom. In akron, the world series of soap box. And he won it. He's from here, taft. Wow congratulations. Belated. It was 1970. Well it looks like you two have become fast friends. Would you like to join us for dinner no. Thank you. I just stopped by to check out Trey's ride. He's gonna help me finish it. I didn't say that. But you were thinking of it. Come on. Stop. Stop. I'm going to leave you two boys to sort this out. It was nice to meet you Mr. Gibbs. Roy. Roy. Don't you ever do that. Don't you ever do that again. Do what? Put me in a spot like that. I didn't put you anywhere. You're a grown up, you can put yourself wherever you want. And if that's here, working with this, playing surrogate dad to my surrogate son, then... we both could do worse. That your dad's? Yeah. Sweet ride. Well tomorrow we see if she rolls. I'll pick you up before sunrise, less wind to slow you down. Okay oh I know what I'm calling it. The car I'm giving her a name. Not a bad idea. The two things my pop said you can't live without is faith and courage. That's what america's all about. And I was thinking we could go back to your buddy's place and have him paint the name on each side with big flowing letters and maybe throw on a few blue flames shootin' from the nose with white trim. Faith and courage, the good ole red, white and blue. Totally rocks, totally what we're about! Say's who? Us? What have I done to lead you to believe that I give two cents about the good 'ole red white and blue? Well, don't you? Exactly. You think because we spend a little bit of time here together working on this car you know me. You think my son dying the way he did i'm all rah-rah for america? That's not the case. Maybe for some folks, but not for me. Far from it. I paid that price kid and that account is closed. What is with you? Everything is like one step forward and two steps back. Why can't you just get going and... get happy? Come on, I'm sorry. See you tomorrow? What? You sure you don't want any food before you go to bed? You didn't touch your supper. Naw, I'm good. Are you? Yeah. Why did dad join the reserves? He didn't have to, right? No he didn't. But it was all his choice but when you were born he started talking about it, more seriously. When we first met he was a pretty wild guy. But then you came along and, well you just meant the world to him. He slowed down, he took stock of well everything, how it all might affect you, and the world you were living in then 9/11 happened and pretty much sealed the deal. Can people change? I suppose it depends on having enough reason to do so. Alright what do you think you're doing? What does it look like? You want to get yourself hurt or maybe even killed? What do you care? Boo hoo hoo save it for somebody else Trey. You don't know the first thing about drivin' that car. I beg to differ. Oh you do, do you? What do you do when you hit the hill about 30 miles an hour and you veer off to the right, hard? Pull it back to the left. Hard! That's it? Yup. Well congratulations you're dead. Nice ride. Alright my turn. Get out of the car. Trey come on get out of the car. Look at me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't show up, my bad. Don't make me regret coming out here Trey. Now you wanna learn how to ride this thing correctly or not. Yeah. Take off that ridiculous looking helmet. But every picture I see has a helmet tho... Take it off. Here. This ain't riding a bike. Put those on. That's a helmet. Put it on. How's it feel? Perfect. Smells a little funny tho. I bet it does. You should see where it's been for the last half a century. Show me a good driving position. Good, good. Now alright you're rolling down the hill and you start to veer off to the right hard, what do you do? Bear down on the break and turn back to the left gently break. No big, quick corrections or you're going to flip quicker than a fried egg. Ready? Let her fly. Three, two, one. Keep a straight line. Straight line. Keep keep a straight line. I am. Trey. Trey. Trey. Trey where are you? Hey, are you alright? I'm fine, I'm fine. What happened? I veered off and hit the brake way too hard then I corrected back way, way too hard! What's so funny? I just wanted to see if you were right. You were! Good news the good old helmet works. I'm not so sure about that. Come on get me out of here. Get yourself out smart guy. Okay. Hey. So check it out, Roy's gonna get me in the race up in Sacramento. Yeah. And even if I don't win if I place second or third we can go to the western regionals up in Seattle. Win there and we go straight to akron! Wow. What happened to your chin here? Oh I flipped my car. I'm cool. Don't look at me, he was the one doing the driving. Alright so what are we doing tonight here... Can I get you guys something to drink? Uh, chocolate milk. Water. Water. I'll have a beer what ever you have on draft. Sure. Ladies refills? No thanks. Fried chicken. I'll pay for it later, but I want it now. Do you know how long this beautiful lady and I have been married? Goin' on thirty six years this November. That's fantastic. High school sweethearts. Fell in love with her the day she said she'd never go out with me in a billion years. Got my first kiss from her the very next day. What's the secret? Oh I don't know Trey, I suppose you just try and stay friends and not hide too much from each other. And stop sniffin' around when there's nothin to smell. Thank you. Thanks. Well, here is to akron and all the asphalt in between. For pop. For pop. Hey Trey. How you doing? I'll see you inside okay. Hi. Boy you look handsome. Thanks. I need your help. Okay. It's Mr. Gibbs. Roy. I think he drinks too much. And when he does he changes. I see. But I know deep down he's a great guy, he just works so hard to pretend he's not so, I was thinking maybe you could say a prayer for him you know ask god to put a little zip in his life. Zip in his life? Yes I do. But Trey why me and why not you? I would, but to be honest, I've been less that stellar since my pop died. Oh I see. Well Trey, god is very forgiving, and he'll give you forgiveness if you ask for it, and you mean it. I know... Well then, I think god would like to hear about this issue from you directly. Okay, but maybe you could say a word too. I think we need to tag team on this. I'll tell you what Trey. Let's go in there and see what we can do for everyone. Okay. Yeah. Alright. Honey lets go on inside. Come on let's go. And lord we ask that you give us power to witness lord and to reach out to those in needing. That we may reach out to this hurting world lord, and feel them with your grace and mercy and love. In Jesus name amen. Amen. What time is it? Six thirty. Six thirty! Oh man I set the clock for six. Stupid thing never works. Smells good mom. Slow down. Mom! What? Where is it? Where is it! The car where is it? Alright you were outside did you check... Where mom? Where? Where do you see it? I can't see it. Why would you think it would be outside when it's inside. I don't get it? Where is it? You know it's those kids. What kids? Just kids. They've all been eying it when I brought it through town. One of 'em took it. Thanks man. Thanks. Anything else you want to bring on me? Come on bring it on. Come on. Trey! Come here now! Hey whats up? The car's gone. What? You're right man this country stinks. You can't afford something, what the heck, just go ahead and steal it! Man. That's a bummer. Oh well, that's that. Don't say I didn't warn you. One step forward, two steps back. That's the way the old good red white and blue rolls these days. I guess I'll see you around. You're mean. I swear, I wanted to have it back here and surprise him before he woke up, but those flames and that lettering it's not normally an overnight job. Don't. Don't touch it's still sticky. Wind will dry it when we hit the road. Thanks. Yeah. Hey you all packed up? Just ten minutes. Five. I got to get everything in the truck. You ever puke? What you gonna be sick? No, I was just wondering if I puke? Yeah. Course I puke, everyone pukes. You are one random kid Trey. Yeah, but you know when you get that feelin' and it's sitting right at the top of your stomach, up near your throat and you try to hold it down, you try not to spew but no matter how hard you try, it just has to come out and then all of sudden your hurlin' all over the place? Yeah Trey. Trey I know what puking is. I imagine your trying to make a point here. Get to it. You're actually making me sick. Okay, well, I guess the concept is that no matter how hard you try to keep it down the body, when it needs to get rid of something, just won't be stopped. Yeah. Body can do that in more ways than one. Exactly. So maybe the head works that way too ...Like if you got something that needs to be dealt with, it just, I don't know, has to come out. Like you and a mouthful of words? I was just thinking, that maybe if you didn't drink so much, you could get rid of some of the pain that's inside. Great. Now I'm doing' a road trip with Dr. Phil. Here you go. Thank you. Good luck. Well welcome. Who do we have here? Trey Caldwell Caldwell Caldwell here we go. So you're gonna be racin' a super stock, is that right? Yes sir. How much you weighing today, Trey? About eighty-five. Eighty-five. Does that sound about right, dad? Oh, no i'm... this is Roy, he's not my dad, he just helped me build the car. Roy won the derby in 1970 in akron. Well, welcome Roy. Maybe later you can join me up in the stands, maybe say a few words. You know PR goes a long way these days. Sure, why not. Alright there you go Mr. Caldwell. Thank you. When do you think everybody's gonna start showing up. I don't know. I was kind of hoping I could wear your old helmet. You better go with that one. You sure? I'm sure. I thought this was like a big deal. State championship, where is everybody? It is what it is. Come on, let’s get that car prepped. Yeah. There goes the race. What? Girl over there, pink ride. She's got like a Nascar crew working for her. Tire rack? What is tire rack? I don't know. I guess it's her sponsor. How do I get a sponsor? Trey, listen to me. Here's the thing about this race. Once you get up on that hill all that fancy stuff goes away and the only thing that can help you win is you. Focus. Win a race, then we'll talk about sponsors. Here let's check out this helmet. Yeah. How's that feel. Feels, feels good. Hey hey. Focus. Focus. Here hold those. Got it... got 'em. Welcome racers and ladys and gentleman to the all American soap box dery the California state championship here in Sacramento. Now the winners of today's race will advance to the western regionals in seatle, Washington. So good luck to our racers. There you go. Now hop on. Alright. Now listen to me. It's your first race right? Yeah. You want to keep it nice straight line. That's all you want to think about. I want you to focus. Keep it line keep down. I want you to get in that body position. That's right. That's it. Good. You're looking good. Take a deep breath. You good scared. Alright. Good to go. Alright. Good luck. Alright. Drivers in position. Faith and courage. In Lane one the pride of silicon valley, San Jose, it's Kate slater. In Lane two, from taft, first time racer Trey Caldwell. Racers ready? Three. Two. One. And there off folks. That a boy. Shoulder's backing down Kate keep your cool. Straight line. Here they come. Pull in. Pull in. Trey Caldwell is baring down. Do it. Look at that Kate slater now taking the lead. Bring it in Trey. And here they come. You're almost there. Yes. And Kate slater is the winner from San Jose. Congratulations to Kate slater and her team. I don't understand it. How she just pulled away like that. It's how it rolls sometimes Trey, no pun intended. I read that there was this kid in the eighty's that you know won in akron, but was disqualified because he put magnets or something in his car. Do you think she cheated. She didn't cheat. How do we know that? Have a nice summer everybody, and keep up your reading. Trey, Mrs. Banner wants you to see her in her office before you go. Hey come on in. So I've got good news and bad news for you, which do you want first. Good? No summer school. We got you through. And the bad news? Well we won't get to visit with each other as much as we have been. There's always next year. I mean I could mess up again. No, no we got you back on track. I want you to stay there. Yes ma'am. Maybe we should catchup Sunday's after church. I'd like that Trey. So, I hear things didn't go your way in Sacramento. Nah, I still got a chance... still have a chance. I still have a chance up in Seattle. Trey, of any other child that I know I am convinced that you have whatever it takes to get whatever you want in this life, as long as your willing to work for it now I want to see you start to apply yourself by yourself. Yes ma'am. You going to keep up your summer reading? Yes ma'am. You really want to get out of here don't you? Yes ma'am. Kinda. Alright beat it. What that girl did, it wasn't cheating, it wasn't magnets. If it was she would have pulled away right at the top. The kid you're talking about throne who cheated what he did was he put magnets in the nose of his car so when the metal starting gate dropped he got an extra push or pull from the magnets. But it happened up at the top. No she didn't cheat. Here's what I think happened. You ever seen a sprinter run, do the hundred or something? Yeah. I think. You ever notice at the end, right near the finish line that, that extra little push. That lean they do into the tape. Yeah. Good. Now picture this, you're rolling down the hill, you're picking up speed, at some point maybe about half way your going to reach maximum velocity. There's no more slope to give me anymore speed. Right that's when I draw in, get real small, keep it straight like you told me that's right. But there's one more thing you can do. And it has to happen right here. Right, right in this area, right at the end. Here hold this. You look really dumb in there. I bet. Alright so the finish line is only a couple of lengths away your neck and neck just like you were with that girl. What I want you to do, but it has to happen at the exact right moment, I want you to come out of that ball, I want you to lean back and throw all your wight forward. You see that? See how it moved just sitting here? You do that at the exact right time, you're going to get that change in momentum, you're going to get that difference that's going to push you across the finish line. Now here's what I call it, and I don't want you to repeat this to anyone. It's called the butt blast. Why? You'll find out. Focus. Focus sodas are up. Thank you. Here you go. Here give me. Hey I think I realize what Tom was trying to do getting him involved with all this. Turn him into a car guy? There’s something about a car that turns a boy into a man. Shame he's not here to see this. He's here Trey focus. Heat two drivers, places please. In this race Kate slater from San Jose, California will be facing Finn Cooper who hails from Reno, Nevada. These youngsters will be racing for the second of three spots in the super stock division in akron this July. That's it Kate. Go for it. Come on don't worry about it. Ready? Three. Two. One. You're behind sweetheart. Come on. That's it you got 'em. Yeah! Yes! The winner of the second race in the super stock car division is Kate slater from San Jose, California. She advances to akron. Congratulations Kate slater. Here you go hun. I just don't get it. I mean it wasn't even close. That's how it is sometimes, out of nowhere, you just... things go your way and your car does stuff you never knew it could. But you don't count on it. You always go back to basics and... race my race. That's right. I don't feel so good. You okay hunny? Maggie, he's fine. He's just a little nervous. Quit wihinin' and have some chicken here. Maggie, Trey, I'm going to say this in front of your mom. I am having a beer a beer. It doesn't mean I'm a drunk or whatever funky thing you have locked in your mind about me. Take a look around, everybody’s doing exactly the same thing. So just let it go, give me a break would you. Come on, come on kid. Fine whatever. He just really cares about you that's all. In Lane one, returning regional champ from Phoenix Arizona, Dean damski and in Lane two, from taft, California, first year racer Trey Caldwell. Racers, positions please. That's right. Gates are up. Hey focus. Just race your race that's all you can do. Sir, we're about to start... alright. Focus. Of the all American soap box derby in akron this July. Best of luck to each of you. Racers ready? Three. Two. One. It's good. You got to get in. Yes. Yes. Bring it in. Come on. Come on. Oh my, what a race! Now that's what I'm talkin' about! Trey Caldwell from taft, California moves on with two others to akron, Ohio. We'll see you in July... You're a winner. What? I get it now. What do you get? He won! Isn't that amazing. Butt blast! What are you talking about? Hey guess what? I'm going to akron. Hey. That was Roy, he and Audrey want to have us over for dinner, talk to us about something. What? Derby's broke Trey. Bank loaned them money, they want it back. Like I said a while ago it's all just goin' down the toilet. Roy. I don't get it. I just don't get it. How could they be out of money? Come on Trey, like everything else it's a business and businesses need money to keep going. Come on man you were there, you saw those races. When I was a kid there were, I don't know, there were five ten times as many kids racing and it was a two maybe even a three day event, and now it's done in what an afternoon but listen to me you have every reason to be proud... save it! Trey! Look Maggie it's alright. He’s angry and I get it. But you're a smart guy Trey look around. Kids got their noses barried in their computers and their Internet games and whatever it is you guys do these days. How many, how many soap boxcars have you seen up on that hill since you and I started? How many? One. Yours. Back when I was out there the kids would be lined up half way down the hill just to get a run in before supper... On top of all that you got a country - yes, your good ole red, white, and blue, that's so sideways it can't see the top of the hill from the bottom of the hill. And those fat cat politicians over in Washington up on the hill in their ivory towers they don't care. Your dad dying, my son dying doing noble things for this country. Sad truth... it doesn't make a bit of difference. Sure we put up a wall in their honor, we throw 'em a parade, but in the end, nobody cares. So you tell me where does the soap box derby fit into all that? I'm sorry kid the dream is dead. I was stupid for thinking just for a moment, maybe just for a minute, I might have been wrong. Yeah? Alright, alright I'll be right there. What is it? Fire, big one. Let me drive you. I'm fine just go back to bed. Roy please! Audrey! Not now, just go back to bed. On my way. You still here? Yup. You want to give me that water down there. Sure. You know I've been thinking... Oh, oh. Something my dad used to say, kind of applies to a lot of things yeah what's that? For every action there's an equal and opposite reaction. Your dad courtesy of Einstein. Actually it's Isaac Newton, but that's not exactly how he puts it anyway kind of like consequences, everything you do has a consequence, you know good or bad. You breath, you live, you hold your breath to long, you die. You drink too much you get in an accident, you crush your legs. Trey, I know where your going with this and as your friend i’m begging you, not today. How much is it to go to akron? To fly there or something? What? Ohio! I need to go to akron and talk to the bank about the derby. They can't give up! Well I'm not sure, but I don't think you have enough here. Fine, I'll work, I'll cut lawns, I'll wash cars, whatever, I just need to get there soon. Trey, look, I've got work, you know we've got a lot of stuff planned. Fine, fine. That's good it's cool. Don't worry. Trey right? Son, I have to tell you that I am very impressed that you took this trip all the way from California, and that the derby means so much to you. I just, I find it very encouraging. I think it says a lot about your character, and maybe about all the kids coming up these days. Why don't you take a seat, okay. Want a jelly bean? No, thank you. Trey. I know why you're here, and I want to help you, but I have a problem. My hands are tied because the derby already owes this bank a great deal of money. Yeah, I know. Hard earned money that people deposited in this bank. People, good people, who don't necessarily care about the derby the way that you do. Or I do. I just can't turn my back on them. They want to know where their money is, and what we're doing with it. They trusted us, me, to use their money wisely. So I'm sure you understand, we can't give them more money to keep going. They need more money to have their races so, as much as I hate to do it I am now going to have to think about selling their assets to settle this debt 'cuz I'm under a lot of pressure. That's my job. I know you think I'm the bad guy here, but I'm not. I raced in the derby when I was a kid. Here I brought this for you. See that. That's me. So, I know what you feel about the derby. So, maybe we should try to work together to save it. If you could just let the derby go on for this year... Son, I can't. It's not gonna happen. Not this year. Can I help you? Huh? Pretty nice, huh? Yeah. You got a name? Oh, sorry, I'm Trey. Trey Caldwell. I'm ed. That's my principle, Mrs. Banner. You work with the derby? You could say that I've been here a long time. You want to see some history? Come on. Had to move the starting line 'cuz the cars kept getting better and better and faster. Had to move it three times. Want to see something really cool? Wow! Yeah. Every year we confiscate the winning car, keep it here, so they can't use it again. I didn't know that. That's the grasshopper. 1967. What a sight coming down that hill. We got 'em all. Scale models of all the first second and third place winning cars over the years. And just like that it's gone. Like all good things. It's wrong. You won't get an argument from me. I don't suppose there's many job opportunities in the market place for an eighty year old derby junky. America, land of the free, home of the brave, I'm not giving up on you! Too great of price has been paid to let you down. Yeah I know you're not doing great right now, but I'm not giving up on you. I don't know about anybody else, but if someone is sick I don't run away. Maybe I can't fix it, maybe I can't make it better but at least I can try. My good friend Roy always tells me to focus. Maybe that's whats wrong, maybe that's why things stay so bad. Maybe we focus on that too much and forget about all the great stuff about you. And I know it’s there. I see it everyday. I see it in all the people who live here, rainbow of cultures with a common dream. I see it in my family and friends and I'm so tired of people complaining about what's wrong and doing nothing about it. The dreams of people before you promise something better, the sacrifices of people before me guaranteed those dreams could become a reality... My pop died fighting for you. I'll never get to do all the stuff I wanted to do with him. That's my soapbox derby car, my pops gave me that last Christmas. At first I didn't know why, but now I think I do. He wanted me to feel and see something he knew as a kid I believe everything happens fora reason, and maybe if he had lived to race that car with me, it might not mean so much, but he didn't, and well now it does. I love you america! I say that proudly and unashamed. I say it loud and clear from sea to shining sea. I won’t give up on you. I know god has a reason for everything. I know all I have to do is keep believing and having faith. And I do. In you. God bless you america. God bless-all who have died to keep your dream alive. Don't give up the fight. That's what I'm trying to say here. To everyone. I think if we have faith and put our heads together, work side by side we can save the dream! Save the tradition! Save the derby! I'm Trey Caldwell and I will never give up! Will you? I mean I could edit it, I guess... Trey, it's beautiful Too great of price has been paid to let you down.

But know that whatever happens, your dad would be so proud of you. I love you. Thank you for being here. I love you so much. Thank you for being here. Dear god, I really want to win the race, the whole thing. I want to win it for my dad. I know he's up there sitting next to you, not to happy that I'm being so selfish, but I do. I really want to win this thing for you pop. And if, if it's okay can I ask another favor. Can you just help Roy. I keep trying to but he's hurting too much because of his son. So, I don't know, if there's anything you can do to help him get through this i’d gladly appreciate it. In the name of Jesus, amen. Oh hi. Morning. Can I borrow him? Sure. Let's go for a roll and stroll. You've worked pretty hard for this day, didn't you? Yes sir. Faced a lot of adversity along the way, me included. What? Got you some juice, get that c in you. You're a heck of a kid Trey. Even if you're a royal pain in the butt sometimes. I just want you to know that you-deserve to be here. You've earned that right more than anyone I know. There's a consequence for every thing you do. You worked hard. Here you are. Yes sir. I drink too much, i'm foolish, here I am. Yeah. But you know something, I'm a better man today for it, for knowing you, and if this is the way god wants me to roll who am I to second guess that. I may not have my legs, heck I may never walk again. But I've got you to lead me in the right direction... And guess what? What? You know what started right herein akron, Ohio? Aa. Alcoholics anonymous. Maybe I'll pay 'em a visit. Hey none of that, hey. Trey, none of that. Today you man up, don't you waste your tears on me. Come here. Ladies and gentleman, boys and girls.

Nice race, for a newbie. Thanks. Congratulations. Kate slater. Trey... Caldwell. Yeah, I kinda know that. You know you're sort of famous around here. I'm sorry to hear about your dad. I really wanted him here today, even to see me lose. I know, I lost my mom a little while ago. Thought she might make it here, but she was sick for a pretty long time. Breast cancer. Not nice. Oh, so that's the pink. Yeah... yeah. Not really a big fan of pink but so anyways, I just you know wanted to say hi. See you around? You can count on it. Back at you. So? She's alright. Bark is louder than her bite. I came in third. Man, that just stinks. I prayed to god to let me win, got down on my knees... Who says these other kids didn't pray too? I lost Roy! After all this, I lost. Came in last. Trey, you know when me and Mac and the guys get called to put out a fire, it looks like we're trying to save a house or building, right? But that's not, that's not really what it is. Oh we want to if we can of course, but it's, it's the stuff inside that we fight for. Of course we want to save the people, make them safe and their pets. But, it's the other stuff, the personal stuff, you know the photographs and the memories, the traditions of that family, the history. That's what you saved here today. You won a race Trey. A much bigger race. Man, you single handily saved the soap box derby, seventy years of history, and you saved that. There's always gonna be another race, here, some place else another house for people to live in. But the traditions, that's what you saved here today. Congratulations! Of course losing might have had something to do with that funky helmet that you had on. No. To quote a famous friend I know, sometimes that's just how it rolls, no pun intended. That meant a lot to me.
