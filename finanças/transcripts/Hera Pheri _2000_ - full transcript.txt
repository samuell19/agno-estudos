Sir, here's ICI bank. Sir, will you light this up? - Sure. Why not? Hail Lord Hanuman! Lord, resolve all my troubles today! Good morning! Sir, I've applied for a job here. My father was your employee.. ..he expired during the fire accident in 1992. According to law, I should be replacing him. Please go there. Shyam! - My name is Ram not Shyam. My name is Shyam and I've applied for a job here. After my father's death.. - Please go there and talk to him. What is it? - I've applied for a job. This is not the place, go there. Go there. I don't understand, are you people trying to make fun of me? Everyone's trying to make me run around. - (Calling out) Hello, come here. What's your problem? Come in. Which relative of yours was working here? My father. - What's the name? Shyam. - Shyam! So, when did Mr. Shyam die? Shyam is my name, my father's name is Mr. Sundarlal. He died on December 3, 1992. - I'm sorry. Mr. Shivshanker Paniker was another man who died.. ..with your father in the hospital, right? Yes. His relative too has applied for a job here. Since he was senior to your father.. ..we'll have to give him the first preference. Sir, my father expired prior to him.. ..then how can he be senior to my father? I know that, but both of them expired on the same date, isn't it? But my father expired 9 minutes 28 seconds prior to him. Then according to the seniority of expiry my father leads. So I should be considered first. 10 and a half months ago, I was refused a job because.. ..they claimed that my father died 8 minutes later. But this time I've brought along a death certificate.. ..and have sent a copy to the head office too. Alright. I need some time to resolve this matter. Some time? - Yes. You've already wasted 6 years buying time. You don't know my condition hence you're saying this. I've taken loans even from cats and dogs. I can't go back to my village. Sir, if you don't help me, I'll hang myself right here. No, please don't waste your life for such a petty matter. I'll recommend your name to the head office. There on, it's your luck. (Humming) (Music) (Humming) (Music) "Whenever..." "...I see a beautiful girl..." "A chord strikes in my heart." (Music) "Whenever..." "...I see a beautiful girl..." "A chord strikes in my heart." (Music) Now, relax. (Music) "All these girls are crazy about me." "There's some magic in me." "What shall I say more about my charm!" "You better ask my belle." "Whenever..." "...I see a beautiful girl..." "A chord strikes in my heart." (Music) "Why do these girls follow me?" "I try to escape from them." "Let's exchange hearts with each other." "Let's do it secretly... but with a smile." "Whenever..." "...I see a beautiful girl..." "A chord strikes in my heart." (Music) (Slaps) - You! Sorry, sir! What is this? Answer me. It is a suit, sir. It was an original suit but it isn't anymore. Sorry, sir! - What sorry! I thought you're an educated man.. ..and gave you a job of ironing clothes this laundry. But is this the way you do it? Sorry, sir! - What sorry! 2 weeks ago you burnt a lady's blouse, and 3 days ago a man's.. Pyjamas! - Yes. And now you burnt this suit! Good progress! Thank you, sir! - What do you thank me for? Enough of your thank yous and sorrys! Progress in your work. Don't ruin my business. Sorry, sir. - What sorry! If you want to attain a position in life then work hard. Don't look at my face! Understand? Idiot! You're an idiot! Hard work, my foot! I'll earn fast money in a jiffy. Sorry! - It's okay. Hey! Hey! Hey! Give me my wallet or else I'll kill you. I'll kill you. Don't try to run away. Hey! Give me my wallet. Wait! Give it back to me. - What? Hand over my wallet. - Jerk! You're a jerk! Give it back to me, thief! Whom are you calling a thief? Hey! What are you doing? Hey! What are you doing? It's mine. No, it's mine. Leave me. You.. No! - Where are you running? Oh no! There he is! Get hold of him. Get hold of him. - Listen to me, sir! My purse! Has he taken my money? Catch him. Star... (Phone ringing) (Phone ringing) (Phone ringing) Hello. I'm Chandu Solanki speaking. Is Devi Prasad at home? Whom are you talking about? This isn't Devi Prasad's house. What? Is he not at home? Then where is he? Good Lord If you want the Devi's(Goddess) offerings.. .visit a temple, not a garage. What? This is Star garage. I'm the owner Baburao Apte... ..and this is not Devi Prasad's home. (Phone dialing) (Phone ringing) Hello! - Hello, is Devi Prasad at home? No, he expired 10 minutes ago. Did you have a message for him? Expired? Bloody dog! Check the number before you dial. Rascal! Hello, is Baburao there? - No, I'm Devi Prasad. Tell me. This damned thing is still speaking despite hanging up. Hello, is Baburao there? Hello! Well, I want a rented... - I got it. Where are you from? - Gurgaon. Indeed, a very good village to live in. People there are as sweet as jaggery. - Yes, that's true. Well, Maruti has.. Maruti, Esteem, Tata, you'd have got everything.. ..had you come earlier. There's just one car left. Come to the garage. No, I don't need a car. - Don't you need a car? No, I've been sent by brother Maruti. Who's Maruti? I don't know anyone of that name. The one who has a restaurant at Matunga. Maruti Rao? - Yes. God! He's such a nice man! He was saying the same about you, that you're a big-hearted fellow.. ..who understands others' grief. So, what is your problem? Well, my name is Shyam. Oh! So that's your problem. Change your name. Why did you take the trouble to travel so far? I've come all the way in search of a job. There's no vacancy in here. Well, job is not a problem. I don't have a place to... First decide what your problem is. Is it name, job or accommodation? Accommodation. - Okay. Accommodation. Do one thing, take a right turn from that street. You will find plenty of hotels to lodge in. Go. But I don't have enough money. There you go! Again you changed your problem. Please allow me to stay here for few days. You're such a big-hearted man. I'm only left with a big heart, nothing else and that's my problem. I won't add to your problems. Fine! But you have to pay a rent of Rs.3000 per month. But I had brought only Rs.500 along. Then give me Rs.500. That'll do. I've spent 200 out of that. Then how much do you have now? - Rs.300. Then give me that! - I need Rs.100 to get a railway pass. Alright. Give me Rs.200. That'll do for now. I've finally arranged for my liquor! I've charged a lesser amount. That's ok. But you've to help me with household chores. This isn't a 5-star hotel. Do you know to cook? - No. Then you can wash the utensils. Come along, I'll show you the house. (Hen clucks) - Look at that! That's my neighbour's hen. She's just like me. - Does it also drink? (Clicks tongue) No. She's big-hearted like me! She lives in the neighbouring house but lays eggs over here. Come on! Actually, I don't need to charge rent from you. But if I don't charge you rent.. ..then you might assume yourself to be the landlord. Don't look at that room! It'll always remain closed. I had let out that room to a drama troupe. Mohini Theatre! They didn't pay me the rent for 2.5 years. They used to make excuses whenever I asked for it. I kicked them out of the house and confiscated their luggage. Did you understand? - Yes. Come along! Here. This is your room. This is where you've to stay. You'll be sharing the room with another man. That's his bag. You're not supposed to use his towel and toothpaste. This is a small garden. And that's our well. You must take water for your daily needs form this well. Got it? This is very deep! But you don't have to go down to take a bath. You can use a bucket to fetch water and take bath here. Come, I'll show you the toilet. This is... - What are you doing, Brother Babu! How many times have I told you to hold the door tight! Or sing a song. Do you know to sing? - No! Then you have to learn. If you want to use the toilet in the morning you have to become a singer. Else you would have to go to the railway tracks, 2km from here. Why? - There's no latch. Earlier there wasn't even a door. Don't follow me around. Go to your room and keep your luggage. Go. Ok. I'm already suffering from constipation... ..and top of that this fellow tries to barge into the toilet. What is it? Why don't you fix a latch on the toilet door? Why should I fix a latch? Is that a treasure chest? Then why do you show the toilet to those who come to see the garage? He hasn't come to see the garage but to stay here. Did you let out the room to this devil? Devil!? He said he is Shyam. He's isn't Shyam. He's a pickpocketer. Mr. Baburao, he's mistaken. Get lost from here! Come on! Go away from here! - Don't touch me! I'll even kick you if you don't leave immediately! I want to hear that from Mr. Baburao. - You want to hear that from him? Baburao! I'll see to it that you leave this place. You'll surely leave this place! Bloody thief! Baburao! I swear on the Almighty! I'm not a thief. A noble man like you shouldn't pay heed to such a man. Had I been a thief, would I've come here in search of a job? Trust me! Please make him understand. Don't narrate your story! Get out! - Look at him! Get out! Here is your bag! - Raju! Raju! - Come on, get out! Here's your bag! Get out! What are you doing? - Don't say a word! Word? Which word? I meant to say don't intervene. Wait a minute. What is your name? Babu! - That's my name, how can it be yours? It's my name. Listen to me, I'm the owner of this house.. ..not a watchman, hence I have a say too. Ram! - Shyam. Whatever, take your luggage and go inside. Go. If he goes inside then I'll leave this house. Never mind, you can leave. Why are you so eager to accommodate him here? He'll not stay for free, he'll pay me rent. You pick up your luggage and go inside. Ok, I'll pay his rent. God! You haven't paid me a single rupee since the past 2 years.. ..and you say you'll pay his rent too? Just leave. - I'll leave this house. I mean it. Please do. I'll leave this house - Please do. I'll seriously leave. - Yes, for sure! I'm going! - Just go! I won't go. I'll pay my due rent and then leave. That means you wouldn't ever leave. Listen, you aren't a thief, are you? No, brother Babu! Take this. - Thank you. No. Don't thank me. Go to that shop and get me a bottle. A bottle? Yes, a bottle of liquor. Orange flavour. What are doing, hero? Dreaming about films? Yes. When are you going to feed me? I'm famished! Tell your new relative to cook for you. Is it? Yes. That's a good idea. He will pay the rent.. ..sweep the house, wash the utensils and cook food. What say? - Yes. I'll ask him to wash clothes from tomorrow. Then you can sit and enjoy the whole day. - Yes. Which day of the week is it tomorrow? - Friday. Friday is a good day. Do one thing.. ..pack your bags and leave this house. Go! (Scoffs) Where will you wander at this time of the night? You can leave tomorrow morning. I'll cook the rice only. - Then you can leave now. I'll cook the pulses too but I won't prepare its tempering. Never mind, I'll have it without the tempering. Now you're behaving normal. (Door rattles) - You're a crow! (Raju humming) Nature's call! (Knocking) - Hey, what kind of behaviour is this? I've shut the door in order to hide this misbehaviour. What are you doing there? Guarding that place? Look at this, Brother Babu! - What happened? He was washing clothes there. No sooner did he see me.. ..that he rushed into the bathroom. Ask him to make it fast. I've got an interview. Does anyone have an interview in the toilet? Raju, come out soon. Let him go. Babu, you don't interfere in my personal matters. Did you see? He's just sitting inside doing nothing. I've kept the door open. Those who have doubts.. ..can clarify it by coming inside. Brother Babu, You're old. Go and check inside. Come on in. You people include me in your silly fights. No, do I have to see this early in the morning? Brother Babu! Brother Babu! "Walk in the sky..." Here you go! How dare you? Wait! Brother Babu! Brother Babu! Oh God! Brother Babu! - Brother Babu! Are you alright? You smashed my chest. - Are you alright? Hit him! Break his head! Go and break his head. - Wait! Where are you running to? Wait! Rascal! You dog! Hit him! Brother Babu! (Thud) Brother Babu! - Hail Maharashtra! Catch him! - Hey! Stop. Wait! Where will you escape? Brother Babu! - Rascal! Brother Babu! No. Sorry. Let me hit him! - I'm sorry! Let me hit him! Hey Brother Babu take care your loincloth. You were hitting me! - Brother Babu! Pick it up! How can I pick up a stranger? She must be weighing around 40- 50 kilos. (Chuckles) Loincloth! I said, Loincloth. Take this. Give it to me! Should I come over later if there's some problem? No, there's absolutely no problem. We were just practising Karate and Kung-fu here. Who is Shyam among you? I'm Shyam. Would you mind coming here for a moment? Do you have some work with me? - Yes. She has some work with me. Saw that? - No. I draped my loincloth before she could see anything. Not that. Did you see how girls are following Shyam? She must be his sister. - Such a fair sister? How do you know? Both of them wear spectacles. According to that theory, you should be their father. Why do you always create a scene at Indian Capital Investment bank? Scene? Oh! You mean for that job? Does this suit a decent man like you? It's their fault. I deserve to get that job but they're giving it to someone else. But who are you? I'm from ICI bank and the bank manager.. ..has selected the deserving candidate. Please sign here. - Thanks! I knew I would get this job someday. Where do I sign? - Here. What is this? NOC! What do you mean? It says that you don't need this job anymore.. ..and that you don't mind giving away this job to someone else. No Objection Certificate! Is it? So that Shivshanker Paniker's relative gets the job. I won't sign it. Go and tell your bank manager. As long as I'm alive that relative of his won't get a job. She will. And her name is Anuradha Shivshanker Paniker. That's me. But don't even dream of working peacefully after snatching my job. Why? Are you the queen of this place? No, I'm the Bandit Queen. I can go to any extent. (Scoffs) Hello! Excuse me! Ma'am, the one wearing spectacles. (Calling out) Yes, you. I'm calling out so politely and you're giving me such a look. Sister... - I don't need your help. I know that no one else can help you better. How will you do that? You just need that NOC letter to get the job, right? That's an easy job. I'll get the NOC paper signed. I know that brute won't sign the NOC letter.. ..and I know how to acquire his signature. So you don't need my help. Are you sure? Bye! Wait! Yes? - Can you really do for me? Look, I've never lied till date. The moment I saw you, the brotherly feeling awoke in me. That's why I called you. Shyam is my childhood friend. He would do as I say. But I saw you both fighting! There is fight, tears, sorrow, joy in every place where love exists. This is our daily routine. We've already had a bad row. Will he... No problem, sister. Now you just tell me your requirements of the letter. (Groans) Oh God! It's too hot. Oh God! Good Lord! (Groans) In Borivali, a tenant beat up his landlord and kicked him out of the house. A tenant strangled his landlord for the sake of a girl. Oh God! - Brother Babu, women destroy everything. People kick their parents out of the house.. ..who is a landlord after all? These Landlords are fools. They accommodate anybody just for the sake of some money.. ..and that too without any agreement. Well Brother Babu.. - Yes? Do you have a house in the village? No, I don't. Why? If Shyam kicks you out of the house someday.. ..I'll manage somehow.. ..but for how long will an old man like you wander about in the streets? Raju! You better mind your tongue! Look, he's so full of guilt. Watch out! One day this house will be full of his girlfriends.. You're sure to be kicked out. Hey Raju! - My horoscope predicts a murder. Yeah. Even my horoscope predicts the murder of a murderer. Did you see that? How cold- blooded he is! How filthy he speaks! Take my advice and get him to sign a blank paper.. ..or else there'll be a similar news regarding you in the near future saying.. ..a tenant killed his landlord by smashing a bottle on his head.. ..and seized his entire property. I've had enough of your nonsense! Just shut up! Brother Babu, just tell him that it's enough. He's right. You sign a blank paper for me. Don't you trust me? - This man is a cheat! You're a cheat! I pay the rent but you stay here for free. So what if I stay for free? I'm ready to sign. So am I! - Then do it. Why don't you do it? - Bring a paper. You bring a paper. - Why should I? One minute! Both of you go and get a paper. Go! (Scoffs) Oh God! Why are you troubling me with these two people? Death is better! I meant those two, not me. Take this. I've signed on this paper. He hasn't done it yet, he has some malicious intentions. I'm doing it. - Sign it, dear! Move! You sign it. "There's something fishy!" What happened? Did you hear a song? - Song? These are all lame excuses. I bet he's not going to sign this paper. Do it. Sign it quickly! "There's something fishy." Can't you hear a song? Which song? - I can hear it so clearly! I'm telling you he's a cunning man. He's not going to sign. Throw him out with his luggage. - Sign the paper Don't harp about songs. Sign the paper. - Do it! (Scoffs) Song! (Phone ringing) (Phone ringing) Hello! - Hello! Devi Prasad? You rascal! What will you do if he's not there? Sir, where's my fish? - I ate them up. Ate them up? - Yes. I fried it well and ate it. Bloody dog! To hell with Devi Prasad! What are you doing here? (Table bangs) What are you doing here? Hey! What is she doing here? - No problem. What no problem? What is she doing here? She has been appointed recently. - With whose permission? What kind of misbehaviour is this? It's you people who are misbehaving with me. That girl.. - Sir, sweets. On what occasion? On behalf of Anuradha ma'am, for having got the job. Okay! You're bribing others with these sweets, is it? I won't spare you! Got it? Why don't you go and speak to the manager? I will surely speak to him. Hey! Mind your step! Are you sitting here to bully others? What's the matter? What is your problem? How can that girl get my job? Hang on! This letter will answer your question. You've written this letter, haven't you? My letter? - That's right. This letter states that you don't need this job as of now. I haven't written any such letter. Is it? Then how did your signature land here? Identify this signature. Isn't it yours? Have a look! "There's something fishy!" "There's something fishy!" What are you doing? Stop it! Security! Stop him! Somebody snatch the letter from him. (Coughs) Sir, tear his stomach and get the letter out. Shut up! Mr. Shyam! Mr. Shyam... Just wait and watch! I'm warning you! I won't spare this bank! - Listen to me. I'll tell everyone that you accepted a bribe to give this girl a job. No. - Yes. Then I'll get both of you fired and create 2 vacancies instead of one. I'll land in trouble. Why are you doing this to me? If it is so, then place me instead of that girl. Hey! I have an appointment order. No one can kick me out of this office. Got it? Hey! I'll deal with you later! First let me deal with that fraud who gave you this letter. Hey! I'll kill you! Brother Babu! Where are you? I'll kill you, Raju! What are you doing! Have you gone crazy? (Thud) Shyam, what are you doing? I'll get hurt! (Glass shatters) Oh God! Raju! How dare you break my glass worth Rs.2000! Bloody scoundrel! You broke the glass! - Get aside. He has gone crazy. How dare you shove the landlord! - Get aside. Why are you both keen on ruining my garage? Get out of my way! - Make him understand, Brother Babu. First tell me what to make him understand? Where is the paper that I signed that day? Which paper? The one that I signed and handed over to you. Have you forgotten? I've kept it in the cupboard! It is not there. Raju took it away and gave it to that girl. He even stated on it that I'm not interested in that job. Ask him! You don't intervene, Babu! You stay here! - Move aside! No, stay here. - Move aside. Shut up! Shut up! I'm not sparing him because I'm afraid of prison.. ..but for that fact that I want to see myself earning someday. (Sniffles) You go, dear! Remember, the next time you break something.. ..you will have to sleep with Ramlal. Who is this Ramlal? - A mongrel! It is good that you intervened or else I would have.. ..smashed his 32 teeth, he doesn't know me yet! Tell me something, you stole that paper, isn't it? (Laughs) You stole that paper, isn't it? - Yes! Scoundrel! Did u get hurt? - No! Then why were you shouting? - That's my style! (Slaps) This is Baburao's style. Please try to understand. It's necessary. If this doesn't happen.. Oh! So, you both are involved in this plan. Mr. Shyam... - Don't touch me! I'm a manager in the bank but we're friends outside. Good friends! Then why don't you hold your hands and sing a duet? (Laughs) Good sense of humor! Good joke! Look, don't get on my nerves. This is my final warning. Fire this girl and give me the job or else.. ..I'll create problems not only for your job but also your retirement. Get lost! Now everything lies in your hand. What can I do? You can do a lot. Just think about it. You're a woman. What's there to think about? I know that. You're beautiful and he's young. If you want you can get him under your influence just like a fairy. I'm not good at such things. I'll teach you. Just imagine, he's sage Vishwamitra.. ..meditating for a job. I, like Indra, am transforming.. ..you into Menka and sending across to him so that you can.. ..distract his meditation and acquire the NOC letter. (Music) "I'm a girl. You're a boy." "Just imagine what will happen if we get close to each other." "I'm a girl. You're a boy." "Just imagine what will happen if we get close to each other." "Nothing can happen between us besides this." (Music) "I'm a boy. You're a girl." "Just imagine what will happen if we get close to each other." "Nothing else can happen between us besides this." (Music) "You know it come to one time. You understand." (Music) "Stop being crazy. Leave this stubbornness." "Let's be friends. Don't make excuses." "Don't create wrong ideas in your mind. Don't mess with me." "Don't try to stop me. Don't try to entice me." "I'm crazy about you. Sweetheart, look into my eyes." "Don't be silly. Don't try to come near me." "Come on, let's exchange hearts." "Why do you run away from me? Give me a reason." "You're not exchanging hearts with him. All you're doing is..." (Music) "The evening is young. Let's enjoy." "I want to have a word with you. Come closer." "I'm smart enough not to get misled by these fake talks." "You can't beguile me. I know your intentions." "Watch out! I'll give up my life by jumping in the ocean." "Go ahead. Don't cause any further delay. Enjoy the swim." "I come... I go..." "Please say yes. Don't make me suffer anymore." "Okay. I give up. Don't get angry." No way! I can't pretend to be in love. Ok, don't pretend to be in love, but at least pretend to be friends.. Just make him understand or else both of us will lose our jobs. Please. Please try! I request you! Do as I say. Go. (Bus horn blares) Go! Get in the bus. (Bell tolling) Good! Job is done! (Laughs) I must say, that was a good setting. Yes, it was difficult, but God has been kind. Listen, set me up with her. What? Do you have other hot girls too? What nonsense! Who do you think I am? A pimp! I'm not a pimp, I'm a manager. Got it? Yes, I know that even people like you demand to be respected a lot these days. Show me a charming girl show me a photo, what's in there? I say, get lost! Shut up! Stupid man! Listen to me! - Get lost! Take some money. - Don't follow me, I say! Take double the amount. - Leave me alone. Do you need an advance? - Go away from here. Show me a nice female. - Go I say! Will you meet me tomorrow? - I'll hit you. Hey you! He's showing unnecessary attitude. Why are you following me? What a manly walk! Mine or yours? This temper looks so good on you. Aren't you ashamed of teasing a man publicly? I'll call the police. Alright. Don't show attitude. If you want, I'll get out of your way. I'll resign from the job too, just pay me Rs.50,000. What! 50,000! Don't shout! I'm asking for 50,000 not 500,000 rupees. It's a nominal amount. People are ready to pay 100,000 for this job. Are you trying to fool me? I won't give you a single penny. (Scoffs) Can I make a local call in this STD booth? Yes. - Thank you. (Phone ringing) Hello. - Hello, Ms. Savitri please. It's a call from Calcutta. Hello, son! - Mother, how are you? I'm fine, when are you coming? Well, I've applied for a leave. As soon as it gets sanctioned I'll fly down to Mumbai. I'm missing you a lot, son. I'll be there. Don't worry! Anything else? Wait, I need to talk to your son. - Son, hold on. The matron wants to speak to you. Matron? Don't pass the line to her. I'm in a hurry. Hello, Raju. - Yes. Can you get us 25 blankets from Calcutta? What happened? Can't you hear me? Yes, I can't hear you. Speak loudly. Can you get 25 blankets from Calcutta? What kits? - Blanket! Hello! Blanket! - Hello! Blanket! - Hello! Blanket! - Hello! Hello! Blanket! - Hello! What a liar! He says he's calling from Calcutta while he's in Mumbai! What nonsense is this? She's shouting for blankets, even I heard it! Are you deaf? I could hear it loud and clear. Could you hear it? - Yes! Then you yourself get her the blankets. Stupid! Ghanshyam! Excuse me sir. - Ghanshyam! I will sniff you out wherever you hide. What do you want? Sir! - Shut up! Who's shouting? Who is this? - I Don't know sir! Ghanshyam! - Listen, brother! Who are you? Not you, sir! There's another mouse here. Ghanshyam is my friend. He had taken a loan of Rs.35000 from me.. ..and had promised to return it as soon as he gets a job. Are you talking about Shyam? Sir, his name is Ghanshyam. But he doesn't work here. I know he works here. Strange! - Stop him! Move aside! - Stop it! Don't you dare touch me! You people don't know me. Ghanshyam, come out. Or else I'll destroy your office. Sister, Ghanshyam had borrowed Rs.35000 from me. He told that he would return it. Now he's not be seen anywhere. I wonder where he is. I beg of you, please help me recover my money from him.. ..or else my sister's marriage will be at stake. (Crying) He had told me that he is working in a bank. But he's not here. Where do I look for him now? Shyam lives at Borivali. - Where? Borivali, I'm not sure whether east or west. Borivali? - Borivali! Borivali! Sir, excuse me. Sorry for the trouble I caused. I'm in deep trouble. What trouble?! Disperse all of you. Get back to work. You disturbed the entire office! What a problem! Shyam has made my life miserable. (Scoffs) Sir, do you know where Ghanshyam stays? Second house in the first lane. - Okay. Would he be at home? How would he be there at home? He died 5 years ago. He can't die. I'll kill him after recovering my money from him. Sir, are you looking for Shyam? Shyam? - The one with spectacles. Do you know him? If I tell you his address will you bash him up? Bash him up? I'll break that rascal's bones! Don't disclose my name or else he'll escape! How will he escape? Shyam, someone's there to meet you. Come out quickly! - Coming! There he is! Shameless! You ran away from the village, Ghanshyam! Khadak Singh! Why do you always get cross with me? You thief! Devil! Donkey! What's going on? - Brother Babu, don't intervene. What's going on? - Let them settle their scores. Why do you always intervene? - What is he doing? Listen to me! - Leave me. - (Choked) What are you doing? - I'm strangling him! It's okay brother Babu. This is his way of expressing love. This isn't the right way to express love? Leave him! Leave him. - (Coughs) I won't spare him! - You spoilt everything. We would have got to see some broken bones.. ..a good wrestling match, you unnecessarily interfered. What's the matter? - When his father had expired... ..I had given this cheat Rs. 35000! Khadak! Love is the most vital thing in this world. Money comes and goes. What's your name? - Baburao Ganpatrao Apte. Listen Baburao, money comes and goes. But it comes back again. - Then it goes away forever. Can you repay the amount? Listen, there's only a week left for my sister's wedding. If I don't get the money by next Sunday, then her wedding will come to a halt. You didn't want to repay me.. ..that's the reason why you came so far. You know what my sister said before my departure? She requested me not to pressurize you for money.. ..even if her wedding comes to a halt. Lousy fellow! You know that you're dearer to her than me. What if her wedding gets stalled? You will have to suffer for many lives to come. Don't say that, Khadak Singh. Banno will surely get married. I'll repay you in a week. It is a promise. Don't you trust at all? I don't trust you a bit, brother! I want to hear the same from this good man. Brother, will u pay me? - Why would he pay you? He hasn't taken the loan from you. Listen, come to me this Friday, I'll arrange for the money. Then both of us will get Banno married. - Almighty! Is this possible? - Of course. Please leave. Okay! I'll come this Friday accompanied by men.. ..not to bash you up. In case you don't return my money.. ..I'll die right here and they will carry my corpse. One shouldn't do good these days! I'm tired asking for my money. Where will u get the money from by this Friday? I believe I will get the money. - But how? My conscience says I will get the money. Moreover, Banno will surely get married. O' God! Give him the money somehow! Excuse me. I need to talk to you. - What is it? Can you come out for a moment? ..job if I gave you Rs.50000. Did you mean it? I don't want to, but seeing you in trouble I said so. Forget Rs. 50,000, I don't have single penny to give. Whether you work here or you give the job to someone else. I can give it to you in writing. But in return can you give me Rs.35000? You will lose the job. Would you make such a big mistake? Since you're a clever and talented girl, I accept defeat. How did you get to know of my cleverness in such a short span of time? Alright. Come home in the evening and take the money. Come on, mother! Where have you brought me, son? You had taken me to a different place last time. That was our bungalow, where we will reside. This is my office, look how tall it is...touching the sky. Sir, petrol. What's the hurry? We'll fill it up later. Idiot. Welcome, Mr. Raju! When did you come from Calcutta? Hope the train was on time. - Plane, my dear. I came by the morning flight and have brought my mother along. Mother, he's the contractor, the one who deals in cement and stones. Hello! He always speaks of you. Do you stay in Calcutta too? No, I stay in Koliwada. I mean.. Mother, he means to say that I had called him up last evening.. ..to enquire regarding the progress of the building. Yes. - Okay. - Come along! Why do you overact? Can't you speak properly? Pay him Rs.200 and deduct Rs. 50 for having overacted. Where do I pay from? Come on, pay him. Try and understand. - Then what do I do for petrol? Run it with water if not petrol. Please. Pay him, we'll settle the account later. Give me the money! - Come tomorrow! Go now! - Hey! Come. Mother. This is your son's personal cabin. Mother. I will hang father's photo... Raju, when did you return from Calcutta? When did you come? Who is this, son? - I'll tell you. I'm Raju's enemy... sorry friend. First time I met him on the road.. ..I mistook him to be a pickpocketer. Pickpocketer? Yes, he looks like that. - Listen! Why are you shying away from your mother? The job which I wanted to acquire since 6 years.. ..Raju ruined things in such a way that I got the job! I seek your blessings. - God bless you, son. I'm Shyam, Raju's room partner. - Room partner? Yes, he's also my business partner. Yes, that reminds me, the liquor factory that we planned to build.. ..behind the office. - Liquor factory? He means to say the fireworks business which.. ..demands alcohol in abundance. Shyam please! - Oh! Why are you so scared? Why are you hiding from your mother? Remember I had told you that I would surely.. ..return all your favors one day. (Giggles) Come on, take out your wallet! - For what? Come on, out with your wallet. - But for what? For sage Ghanshyam! Mother, Raju is a staunch devotee of sage Ghanshyam! Sage Ghanshyam? Yes, he had prayed at his temple. That's the secret of his success. Really? - Should I tell her! Yes, Ghanshyam! He's a great sage. Look at him, mother! He accepts but does not want to shell out money. Come on miser! Shell out some money. Shell out some money. - But for what? I said give me some money. - But Shyam... my wallet! Shyam! At least give me Rs.100 for the petrol... - Quiet. If I want I can tell her the truth. But I don't want to hurt her emotions. Got it? Goodbye, mother! - Goodbye! Babu! You've started addressing me by my first name? I think I need to double your rent. Today is the happiest day of my life. What's makes you so happy? Banno will never get married and.. ..I'll lose my house in the village too. Didn't u get the money? That girl has nothing. Don't drive us out! - After my father expired.. ..my mother lost her mental stability. I couldn't pay my house rent for 2 and half years. The landlord comes home everyday.. ..and threatens to kick us out of here. That's why I had demanded Rs. 50000 from you. But when I came to know that you're under a huge debt... ...I laughed at myself. This is my resignation letter. This is all I can do for you. I'm giving back your job. Through this job perhaps you might be able to help yourself. Now if I kick you out of this job.. ..even God wouldn't forgive me! She has got nothing, except a big heart. You don't talk about a big heart to me.. ..even I'm a big-hearted person, but do I have money? Looking at you, my stomach's burning! Give me the bottle! - No. You'll die if you drink all alone. Give me the bottle! Brother Babu, I want to tell you something. What? Do you know with whose money I've bought this liquor? Whose? With the money of the biggest cheat in this world. It was his money. This fraud can cheat us anytime. He's cheating his mother, who gave him birth. Rascal! Raju, is that true? Hey. - Hey, Raju. Where are you going? Why don't you tell him the truth? Why don't you tell him everything that I saw? Speak up! I doubt whether that lady was his mother or not. Don't speak a word any further! That lady is my mother! I've been lying to her since the past 1 and a half years. And my lies is keeping her happy. She thinks that her son.. ..works with a reputed company in Calcutta and earns well. He would build a house for her someday. But nothing is true! (Sniffles) Raju, why did you have to lie? What else could I have done? Tell her the truth that.. ..I'm good for nothing, doing petty jobs? I still remember that my mother used to sweep in a school. She used to starve but fill my stomach. I can't see her unhappy! That's why I started lying to her. What else could I have done? Would I tell her that all her dreams were worthless and a waste of time? Should I say this to her? I want to see my mother happy and for that I need money. And I'm ready to do anything for money. I can cheat on anybody for money! Just anybody! I mean it! I can cheat on anybody! Just anybody! I can cheat on anybody! I can cheat on anybody! I can cheat on anybody! Had you revealed the truth to my mother today.. ..she would've died out of shock. I've hurt you a lot. Please forgive me if possible! I'm sorry! Are you still upset with him? (Sniffles) Give it to him. Hey! Take it! Come on! Come on take it. Come on! Have it. (Chuckles) Everybody is in grief, he is, you are, and so am I! My father worked hard and built this garage and house. He had really worked hard! When my mother fell ill, he ran into debts. He died before he could clear all his debts. I want to fulfill my father's wish. I want to repay all his debts before dying and sit on a chair.. ..and spend a day in the veranda head held high in pride. That's my dream. By sharing, our happiness increases.. ..and sorrows lessen. Isn't it? Hence, today we shall share our sorrows. Here you go! "Let's just forget the bygones." "And start life afresh in a new place altogether." "With a new sunrise..." "Let's make this journey an easy one." "Let's sow the seeds, the fruitful harvest of which..." "..can be benefitted by our generations to come." (Music) "No matter if you're capable of doing anything else of not..." "...but this is one thing that you're capable of doing."

You will just get it once." "Don't just waste it." "Or else you will regret later." "Your breath is like a thread. Link it with your life." "No matter if you're capable of doing anything else of not..." "...but this is one thing that you're capable of doing." (Music) "Today we're alive, tomorrow we might not be there." "Who knows anything can happen in future." (Music) "No matter how big a bungalow you have, but you go sleepless." "Despite having an ocean full of money..." "...a person's thirst never quenches."

"No matter if you're capable of doing anything else of not..." "...but this is one thing that you're capable of doing." (Music) "Today we're alive, tomorrow we might not be there." "Who knows anything can happen in future." "Give love to others. Love is a precious thing that you can share." (Phone ringing) (Phone ringing) (Phone ringing) (Phone ringing) (Phone ringing) Who is it? Hello! Hello! Kabira Speaking. - Okay. (Receiver hang up) Was it correct? Fool! It was a wrong number. Check the number! - Yes, sir! The number was correct. It was of Star Fisheries. Star.. Star Fisheries! It's the same number. Triple eight-one-two-one-two! - What? 8881212. (Phone ringing) Who is this Kabira? - Speaking! Don't hang up. First listen to me. Tell me! Devi Prasad, your grand daughter Rinku is in my custody. Okay. I'll tell my son to rescue his daughter Tinku. Is that fine? These kids are doing mischief at this hour! What happened? I think the old man has gone crazy. Brother Babu, I am going to the toilet. (Phone ringing) (Phone ringing) I can't even open my eyes. Hello! Pay attention and don't dare to hang up. Because Kabira never jokes. Listen! (Groans) Grandfather, save me! Grandfather! Brother Babu! Brother Babu! Brother Babu! Brother Babu! Raju! Raju! Listen! The phone.. listen to this! Listen. (Rinku crying) Someone's crying! - It's Rinku. Rinku? Yeah, she's my granddaughter, according to them. Your grand daughter? - Let me get married first! That's fine, but whose call is it? Kabira speaking! He was saying that again and again. Kabira speaking is a nice name indeed! Kabira speaking! - Hello. What happened, Devi Prasad? Did you get a shock? You've earned a lot with your company, Star Fisheries. Now if you want your daughter back safe and sound.. ..then arrange for Rs. 1 million. Kabira will give you a call once again tomorrow at 10 a.m. I'll tell you the place and time to get the money. Don't inform the police or try to track us down. Or else your granddaughter will be fed to the dogs! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! - (Phone switch hook rumbles) Who is it? What is he saying? - (Receiver hang up) Someone named Kabira! He has abducted Devi Prasad's granddaughter.. .the owner of Star Fisheries and has threatened to kill her.. ..in case he doesn't give him Rs. 1 million. It's not that easy. From where will we get the number of Star Fisheries? Call up Kabira and enquire. Yes, such a wise idea to ask the thief about his theft. Isn't it? Go and have a look at the directory. Forget it! Why do you want to invite trouble? Unwanted trouble! - Raju, come along! Go to sleep! What are you up to? S.. Star and company. Star.. - Here. Star fisheries and exporters! 8881212. 8881212. Go and visit an optician tomorrow. 8881212 is Star Garage's number. And this place itself is Star Garage. - No, brother Babu. 8881212 is Star Fisheries' number. What are you saying? - See it for yourself. 8881212. Star fisheries and exporters. Hey! There are two connections with the same number. Check the number of Star garage. Here, it's right below Star Fisheries. 2624545. (Gasps) Oh God! So that's the problem! Now I understand why there have been calls pestering me! The problem is that they have interchanged the numbers. Hence, when you call Star Garage it connects to Star Fisheries and vice-versa! Therefore, they used to pester me by asking.. ..about their fish delivery. Do one thing.. Call up on the other number. 2624545. - Yes. Come on. Let's tell him everything. What will you tell him? About the abduction of his granddaughter. Wait! (Receiver hang up) Why don't we play a game? Raju, what will you play at this hour of the night? Our neighbours will protest! What are you trying to say? Why did this happen to us? Why? It's a wise game being played by Ishwar (God)! Who Ishwar? That stupid grocer at the ration shop? No, The one who sits up there and.. ..weighs the amount of joy and sorrow in one's life. If He wishes us to become rich then what's the problem? Brother Babu, the game is simple but interesting. Look, Kabira thinks we're Devi Prasad and.. ..we'll call up Devi Prasad, pretending to be Kabira. We'll get the money from him.. ..and give it to Kabira finally rescuing the child. Hold on! What does this entire transaction leave us with? This is where the trick lies! We'll ask for double the ransom amount and earn money. No way! This is the wrong way of earning money. Then do one thing. Earn in the most righteous way.. ..and repay Khadak Singh's Rs.35000. Stupid! Brother, God has chosen us to save that innocent girl's life. If we get some money in return, what's the harm? The Goddess of wealth is trying to embrace us.. ..and you are turning your back at her? Dear, this isn't wrong! What say? Shyam, call him up! Shyam, call him up! Come on! Don't hesitate. Come on, do it! Dial the number. Do it. "There's something fishy." Did you hear some song? Oh come on! Dial the number. Do it. (Phone ringing) It's ringing. (Phone ringing) (Phone ringing) (Phone ringing) Hello! - Hello! Kabira speaking! Who is it? You're not giving an interview! Speak with a stern voice! Hello! Kabira speaking. Who Kabira? The one in whose custody your grand daughter Rinku is. Your custody! - What? Your grand daughter Rinku is in my custody. (Receiver hang up) Rinku! Hello! Hello! - What happened? Brother, I think he went to call the cops. What! What happened, sir? Nothing, go to sleep. I said, go back to sleep. - Okay! Hello! - Hello! From where are you calling? Do you need the address of this place? Not it down. Ganeshwadi... What are you doing? He's asking for the address. - Shut up. Where are you calling from? Say exactly what Kabira said to you. Threaten him! Repeat the same. - Threaten him. If you try and track us down or inform the police.. ..I'll cut your dogs into pieces and feed it to your granddaughter! What are you saying? Does anyone do that? Sorry! My mistake! I'll cut your granddaughter into pieces and feed it to the dogs. Look, I won't inform the police. Please don't hurt my granddaughter. Please! Please! - The poor fellow is crying. Ok, I'll give you a call tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. Where to get the money and when, we'll tell you tomorrow. I'll give you whatever you ask for. I will give you my entire wealth. Just ask for it! How much do we ask for? 10 for Kabira. 2.5 for me. Make it 12.75.. 2 million. - 2? Shut up! Tell him 2 million. 2 million! Okay. I can pay you more. I think our problems will get resolved very soon. How? - I'm going to get enough money. Really? So will u be able to get Banno married? Yes. And will be able to return your landlord's money as well. Won't you take money from me? No, it's nothing like that. Was just thinking.. ..that how would I ever be able to repay? Don't repay. Then I won't take the money. Ok, I'll give it as a loan. I would at least be able to meet you keeping this to be a reason. But from where will you get so much money? Don't ask me how, where and why I got this money from. Because I don't want to lie to you. But trust me.. ..I will tell you everything as soon as this matter gets over. What are you doing brother Babu? I'm checking whether the phone's working or not. Sit down! (Phone dialing) (Phone ringing) (Phone ringing) Help me Almighty! Kabira speaking! - Devi Prasad speaking. Are the green leaves (money) ready? Green leaves? Had you asked for betel leaves or money? Shut up! Is the amount ready? Money! - Tell him, it's ready. Yes, it is ready! Okay. Meet me at 2 p.m. this afternoon.. ..behind the Videocon factory. Be there with the money.. ..and we'll bring the girl along. And listen, come alone. Don't even get your driver along. Have you ever seen Devi Prasad? - No! Ask him this question! Then say like that! - What? Nothing. Have you ever seen Devi Prasad? What!? - I mean have you ever seen me? No, I haven't. But if you come alone, then recognizing wouldn't be a problem. Yes. - Alone. And remember come all alone or else your granddaughter.. ..you will feed her to the dogs, right? I'll come alone. Very good! (Phone dialing) (Phone ringing) Hello! - Devi Prasad is on the line. Hello! Kabira speaking! I was waiting for your call. Tell me when and where do I reach? Meet me this afternoon sharp at... 1.. - 1:30 p.m. Behind the Videocon factory at 1:30 in the afternoon. Don't come! I mean come at the front. Meet me near Lord Hanuman's temple with the money. And come all alone! Don't get your driver along. Or else your granddaughter will be... Yes, I know! You will feed my child to the dogs. I'll be there. - Very good! (Evil laugh) (Laughs) (Brakes squeal) What happened? Who called me? - I called you, sir. Why? - Sir, Rinku is missing. What? - Yes. I think she has been kidnapped. What nonsense! - I'm speaking the truth, sir. I swear my God, the child is not at home. If you want, you can search the entire house. Is Devi Prasad at home? - Yes. But he has locked himself in his room. And has sent all the servants on leave. I'm handing over an important case to you. Yes, sir. Devi Prasad, owner of Star Fisheries, is my neighbour. Okay. - Someone has kidnapped his granddaughter. But he is too afraid to inform anyone. - Okay. Keep a close watch on him. Inform me about his activities. - Okay, sir. But he shouldn't know that you are following him. - Yes. Okay. I know you are a famous tailor but I need my clothes soon. You better be quick. Now listen. I have a loincloth. I need a silk shirt and vest and embroidered fez. Why are you bothered about the measurement? First stitch my clothes, I will send the measurement later. Did you check it? - Yes. Did you check the whole house? - Yes. Not a single corner should be left. - Yes. I want plastic paint. - Plastic Paint! And I want wallpaper on both the sides of the well. Inside as well as outside. - Okay. It will cost 15 rupees per feet. Don't worry about the cost. But I want quality work. Got it? Go. - Okay. Hello, friends! - Here he comes! Why didn't you meet me? Why do you shy to demand your own money? Tell me, how much do I owe you? You owe me Rs. 7200. You owe me Rs. 8300. You owe me Rs. 9100. But with interest it sums up to Rs.10,000. I'll waive off the interest for you. - Why would you do that? You must take each and every penny I owe you. I'll pay you Rs. 10,500. You Rs. 9,000. And you Rs.8000. Okay? You can take your money tomorrow. I want to get rid of my debts. Peter, I don't like to buy one bottle daily. Instead bring a tanker filled with liquor twice a month.. ..and fill my water tank with it. I will take a glassful whenever I need. Okay? Raju, brother Babu is getting over excited. Why is he boasting so much? I think the cops will definitely nab him. Change all the tyres, but not on credit. I will pay the money in advance. Got it? Tell me something, did you hit a jackpot? No, dear. Nor did I get any phone call? Whose phone call? I didn't even receive any wrong number. The food is ready. Come fast. What are you doing? Why are you calling them tomorrow? I want to get rid of my debts. Why are you counting the eggs before they're hatched? What do you mean? - I mean don't build castles in the air. Let us sort out the matter first. Call them after few days. Go. Should I call them after few days? - Yes. There is a change in the program. - Change? Come on Sunday. Dress nicely and come. Do come or else I will give the money at your home. Come on Sunday. Sure? - Yes. Alright. We can wait. Why are you drinking so much liquor today? All our dreams will come true tomorrow so.. ..I want to be in the world of dreams. But why waste money? Don't worry. God showers money from all sides whenever he desires. Understood? I think I have to sing it for you. "If God wishes, he bestows upon us prosperity in abundance." "If God wishes, he bestows upon us prosperity in abundance." "There's happiness all around.

Tomorrow you will wear a golden crown. Yeah! Only if we succeed or else we will wear a prisoner's cap. Oh God! Don't jinx it. I have to take my medicine again Why are you drinking so early in the morning? It's my medicine. Do you know how tensed I am? This is a medicine to relieve stress. This fool will create a problem for us. Whom did you call a fool? Whom did you call a fool? Tell me. - Brother! He called me a fool. He called me a fool. - How dare he! Then it's alright. - Wear this helmet. Don't call me a fool again. Let's move. - Don't call me a fool. (Baburao groans) Oh God! Can't you see, Brother Babu? How can I see, you fool? I am wearing this helmet and I haven't worn my glasses. How can I see! Go and get my glasses. Okay. Don't shout. I will get it. Wait here! I'll go and check. - Okay. If I get my money, we'll return to the village today itself. But if I don't get it, take my corpse back to the village. "May his soul rest in peace!" Stop! Let me die first! Ghanshyam... Ghanshyam... Here's your... Who are you? - Khadak Singh... But I am Khadak Singh! How can you be Khadak Singh? I am Khadak Singh who spreads terror! You are Khadak Singh! We are Shyam's friends. Yes. We are his friends. You all look similar. Are you twins? No! We are triplets. All right! First twins and then triplets! You're right. Call Ghanshyam. Tell him Khadak Singh is here for his money. If I don't get my money today, I will fire all the bullets in this gun.. ..and kill myself. - Please don't do that. Shyam already left. - Left? But where? He went to your village to repay the money. But he had called me here. Actually he got the money yesterday so he left. I must return to the village or he'll find some excuse again. Start the car. Get in quickly. (Car engine starts) Hurry up. Start it! Thank God I got saved! - Put down the visor. Why? - Hurry up! (Bike starts) I've reached the spot but I can't see anyone. Wait for him! He will surely come. Sir, a white Mercedes is approaching. That's it. The money must be in that car. As you get the money, call me. I'll get the girl along. Sir, that Mercedes went somewhere else. Never mind! Wait for another Mercedes. Come here. - Where have we come? Come. Sit down. Sit down. What is this noise? Why are you doing? You are urinating. Didn't we sit here to take a leak? It's bound to happen after drinking so much. Raju! Don't address each other by their names. I understood. Raju is right. Shyam, did you hear him? Raju says not to address each other by our names. Understood? Then don't do it. I think he is Devi Prasad. Kabira! - Yes. Kabira. Did you get the money? Yes. Where is my granddaughter? - Give me the money. You will get your granddaughter back. But first hand over the money to us. Give me the money. I will count it. - Are you crazy? - (Brakes squeal) Stop! Return the bag. - Cops! (Brakes squeal) Give me the bag. - He's asking for the bag. Remove the money and give him the empty bag. Come on! Where is the girl? Come on, answer me. We don't have her. Tell me or else I will shoot. No! Who called you here? Devi Prasad. - Go away! Devi Prasad. - Don't interfere in my personal matter. I'm here on duty. So, let me do my duty. I don't need your help. I want my granddaughter. You will get your granddaughter. Where is the girl?

Military personnel can leave. Remove your helmets. Okay. Actually we needed some money. They trapped me in it. I am not a crook. Come on. - I'm taking if off. Move. - I'm trying. Run Raju! - Come on brother Babu. Come on brother Babu. Let's run. Brother Babu, run! Hurry up! (Brakes squeal) (Car horn honks) (Car horn honks) Come on Brother Babu! - Don't leave me alone, Raju.

Come on, Shinde. Come on. (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) Hurry up. - (Gunshot) Get down. Come here quickly. Let's move. Where are you taking me? Throw him in! (Phone ringing) (Phone ringing) I think it must be Kabira. Shyam.. Listen to me. It is dangerous to talk to him now. I know what to say to him. - Don't be a fool. Get out of my way! - Shyam! Hello! - Grandpa! They will kill me. Hello! - Save me. Grandpa! (Rinku crying) Did you hear that, Devi Prasad? Because of your stupidity of informing the cops.. ..I can cut your granddaughter's limbs and make her a beggar.. ..or sell her to a brothel at Benaras. But I will give you one last chance. Last chance. I will call you again and inform you.. ..about the place and time to deliver the money. But I won't give you this chance for free. This time you have to pay double ransom. 2 million. (Cell phone beeps) Hello! Hello! What happened, Shyam? What happened? What happened? Because of our stupidity, an innocent girl's life is in danger. I can't bear the burden of this sin anymore. No. Where are you going? - I'm going to tell Devi Prasad.. ..to and save his granddaughter. Get out of my way! - You can't go. Raju, get aside. - I said you can't go. Get out of my way! My glasses! My glasses! What's this? My glasses! Oh God! I have found it! Leave him, you jerk! Move aside, Brother Babu. - I will whack him. I will kill him. Look, neither of us want money by doing this sinful deed. Then why are you so stubborn? Because I had promised my mother to take her.. ..out of the old age home to our new house. Money! I'm here to collect the laundry bill. (Gong beating) (Humming) (Music) "Hey handsome hunk! What are you waiting for? Go ahead." (Music) (Music) "What do my eyes say? Hear it out, my crazy lover!"

Anyway, what did you want to say? I just wanted to say that you must pay the landlord. I'll take a leave. I'm sorry. I made a mistake. But I will repay your money in a couple of days. I swear. - Sure? I swear. Brothers, Brother Babu always speaks the truth. He is very honest. He can even sell his garage for that. Am I right? - Shut up! Don't jinx it. Please leave. I will repay your money. We won't spare you if we don't get our money soon. I swear. Please leave. - As if money grows on trees! Go.. - Let's go. We've had enough of it. He's back with a long face. How will you get the money? Think about your debts. Think about Khadak Singh's sister's wedding. Freshen up! I've cooked hot water for dinner. It has lentil too if you're lucky enough to find it. (Chuckles) Some people will live in poverty and starvation.. ..but they will always follow the path of truth. (Phone ringing) - The bells of truth are ringing! This call is from Kabira.

Then how will we go, Brother Babu? Come inside. I will show you my treasure now. Treasure? - It's all fake. Even the junk yard fellow won't buy this stuff. Now tell me, which costume would you like to wear? Brother Babu, all this is useless! - Shut up! Just shut up! Last time your plan failed. This time follow my plan. You don't know anything about kidnapping Brother Babu, shall we wear this? - Sinner, leave it. This crown was worn by Lord Ram in the play Ramayana. God will punish you if you commit theft wearing this crown. Don't touch it. - Brother Babu, shall we wear this? Leave it. You don't understand anything. This is Draupadi's sari. It's so long that you will take ages to drape it. You don't understand. This is perfect costume. But where do I have to go? You go and mislead the police I'll go and meet them. I'm scared. - You don't have to do anything. Just get in the car and leave. Go. Come on, boys. Take a left turn. Yes! (Shushing) Brothers, pay attention! Don't make a sound! Don't make a sound! Or else he will escape again. Understood? - Yes! (Shushing) Glory to God! - Amen! Oh God! What is this rally about? It isn't a rally but a funeral procession. Whose? - Yours. Khadak Singh is here. Oh God! What should we do now? (Shushing) What to do? - Just follow me. Where are you hiding, Shyam? - (Vase shatters) I will destroy everything. Where are you? I'll break.. - Don't break it! Are you Shyam's uncle? Listen to me. Where have you hid Shyam? He owes me money. (Baburao screams) You are Shyam's uncle. Tell me where he is or else I'll punch you. I am not his uncle but friend. He has fooled me many times. But today I won't go without taking my money. I will pay you soon. - Why will you pay me? I am not a beggar. He means we too have to collect our money. We will pay you as soon as we get our money. Fool. - Thank you, brother. Let's go and find him. You search inside while we will search outside. Come, brothers. Brother, why have you all worn similar outfits? So that you couldn't recognize us? - What? No! So that Shyam won't recognize us. - Yes. Shyam! Brother, your mask came off! - Thank you.

Call the cops. I have lost my glasses. Who has lost his gun? Please take it. Then don't blame me for stealing it. Whose gun is this? You fool! Where are you running? Halt! Who pushed me? It's you again. Wait! I am a police commissioner. - I don't care. Why did you hit me? Whose gun is it? Child, are you okay? Move aside, Inspector. (Groans) (Grunting) The Marathas will rise again! (Rapid gunfire) Brother Babu, What are you doing? Stop it or you'll kill someone. (Rapid gunfire) Stop it! - It stopped! The other bag! I got both the bags. Babu's glasses. Brother Babu. You!

Raju! Raju! Raju! Raju! Raju! - Raju! It's been 5 hours and Raju hasn't yet reached home? Has it been 5 hours? - Yes. That's strange. He should've been here by now. Where did he go? Whom are you calling? (Phone dialing) Hello! Hello. Is that Kasturba old age home? - Yes. Can you get Raju's mother on the line? She's not here. Her son took away her 5 hours ago. What happened? What did she say? - (Receiver hang up) He left with his mother 5 hours ago. What? - Yes. His bag too is missing, Brother Babu. What are you saying? - It's true. I think he fled. That traitor betrayed us. We were waiting for him like fools.. ..while he must be on the run with the money. He betrayed us! Oh God! He betrayed me! He was dishonest. His intentions weren't good. He himself said that he could do anything for money. And he did the same. Oh God! He did just that! No! We won't spare him. He will try to leave the city before dawn. But we will stop him. Call the cops. We'll live like beggars while he will live like a king. That's not done. Call the cops and tell them everything. (Phone dialing) Hello! Police station. There are 3 more people involved in the kidnapping case.. ..whom you don't recognize. Raju, Baburao and Shyam. I'm Shyam. Yes. Note down. Star Garage. Last Lane. Borivali west. Babu and I are here. You can arrest us. Our other accomplice Raju has fled with the money. The number plate of the car is BMW 253. An old lady is along with him. She's his mother. Shyam, brother Babu. Our destiny has changed. We got 4 million! 4 million! We don't have to worry now. We have enough money. "If God wishes, he bestows upon us prosperity in abundance." What happened? Why are you standing with long faces? Where had you been all this while? I finished many tasks. First I repaid Khadak Singh and sent him back by train. Tomorrow his sister will get married. After that I went to meet my mother in that junk car. I had a flat tyre with no spare wheel inside. It took me 5 hours to fix it. But why did you take your bag? My mother's documents were in it. I submitted the papers in the old age home and took her discharge from there. When you didn't return after so many hours.. ..we thought you had betrayed us. So we.. So we informed the police. What! - Yes. The police will be here at any moment. We can't escape now. What have you both done! What have you done! My mother is in the car. What shall I do now? Raju. - What shall I do? Please forgive us. Please forgive us. (Police siren blaring) (Brakes squeal) Arrest them! Shyam, mother shouldn't see me like this. Inspector, we have a request. Please take us through the back door. (Car approached) Prakash, they are not criminals. I had given them the money. Let them go. My granddaughter told me, you risked your life to save her. I thank you for that. We were helpless, sir. We needed money. - I understand. You can keep that money. It's a reward for saving my granddaughter's life. What.. reward? (Chuckles) Yes. - (Chuckles) Policeman, please unlock these cuffs. After Devi Prasad's statement we don't have any case. Constable, release them. (Phone ringing) Sir, this call is for you. No. This time it's for you. - (Phone ringing) Receive it before it gets disconnected. Let's go. - (Phone ringing) (Phone ringing) Hello! Who is it? Hello! Hello! Kabira speaking. (Laughs) (Laughs)
