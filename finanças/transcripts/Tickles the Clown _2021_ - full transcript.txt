Well, you look like a tractor lericon dragged in. Princess Kali Devine in the flesh, kind of. Why don't you unzip that space suit and relax. It's safe here. Safe? You must be joking. This prison houses over 400 of the most vile, reprehensible, dangerous and psychotic criminals this side of the car star system. This is the last place a lady can feel safe. You forget Princess. We haven't had a breakout or an uprising in nearly 10 years. You can relax. Thanks. Why don't you come up to my office for some coffee and couch time. Excuse me. That came out wrong. I would hope so. I'm the leader of the Galaxy's Allied Forces, warden, commander of the last surviving humans in our universe. I don't have couch time, as you say. I'm only trying to make you feel at home Kali. Call me Princess. And if I ever feel at home here, shoot me. Yes, man. My guards will escort you to your man. He's in our super max wing. You have to pass through several security checkpoints to get to him. The holes narrow the further in you go. I hope you're not claustrophobic. If you feel faint, breathing apparatuses are available from the duty sergeant. I'll be alright. Very well. And just one more thing, Tickles is a talker. He'll spin you in circles if you let him. It's best to be blunt, straightforward to the point. No chitchat, you follow? I think I've got it. And I hope so. Always very nice seeing you, Princess. In you go. Good afternoon, Tickles. Afternoon, that don't mean nothing to me, Girly. I live on the fluorescence. It's always afternoon or evening or early morning or whatever you want it to be. As you wish. I've come so. Already? Excuse me. Nothing. Now go on, detail your importance in those drawl dry terms you official types always use to illustrate your authority. And use your syntax. You know that cadence, that lets me know I'm speaking to someone who holds my fate in the palm of their soft little hand. I don't know who you think you're talking to Tickles. Well, then why don't you tell me? Introduce yourself. You know my name. It's only fair I should know yours. I'm Princess Kali Devine, Commander of the Allied Forces. Oh, all of those strong titles, princess, commander. I bet you like it on top, don't ya? Let's cut to the chase, Tickles. Oh, yes Kali. I love a woman who knows what she wants. Question is, does she know how to get it? I'm here to offer you some time out of this airtight cell. Room to juggle, I'm listening. I'd like to escort you to the prison infirmary for some tests. Escort, oh, I know I'm a VIP prisoner, but this is really extra. I wasn't expecting the warden to send me my own escort. Hey, why don't you take off that stuffy suit and let me see the goods. That's funny, Tickles. Everyone here keeps offering me the chance to shed my suit. Well, save your breath. I'm not interested. Oh, but I am. Good for you. Now back to my offer, How would you like to stretch your legs? If it's between yours, you're on. It's not. Oh! From what I understand, you have been on this room in two years. Is that correct? I wouldn't know. Time is a construct. Well, I'm offering you a change of scenery for the day. In exchange for? Tests, like I said. I've taken their IQ test three times in here, Girly. You wanna know what my results were? It doesn't matter. Oh, but I like to tell people. 189, 198 and 202. You see, I'm actually getting smarter in here. I'm a veritable genius. That's neither here nor there. Neither here nor there, I'm here and you're there. Or, are you here and I'm there? Playing board games is a waste of both of our time, Tickles. But I don't have anything else to do. My schedule is clear. And anyway, I'm telling you the truth. Here or there, I'm here. I'm there, you're here. And here we are. There it is. Where it gets iffy is if I'm there and you're there or I'm here and you're here and I can smell you and reach out and touch you. Your scent is wafting through these vents. Enough chatter clown. Give me your answer. How badly do you want it? Not bad enough to stay in here, going in circles with you. Then lie down and I'll go in circles, slow, steady circles, making you. I take it you're not interested. You take it however I choose to give it, Girly. I see. It looks like we're done here. Oh, so soon? You won't give a straight answer. Oh, but I've given you a string of straight answers. It's your questions that are crooked, commander. How's that? I made you a transparent offer, agree to some tests and I'll escort you to the infirmary for the day. What sort of tests? A basic, but comprehensive physical. Eye, ear, nose and throat checkups, a cat scan, MRI, EKG and a blood draw. Yeah, you want to check this nose, huh? Straight offer, like I said. Why do you want to draw my blood? It's just part of the testing and formality. Formalities don't exist in here, Girly. Everything happens for a reason. A clear reason, that always benefits that machine not the man. It's not a trick, Tickles. Drawing blood allows the doctors to comprehensively review your blood count, metabolic and thyroid panels, enzyme markers and to check for any vitamin deficiencies and diseases. To what end? To send me back to my cell, knowing I'm of sound mind and body as I rot for the rest of my life under these lights! You know, they never turn them off, ah? You knew the consequences of your actions, Tickles. Our galaxy is not easy on criminals of your caliber. Oh, you mean my ex-caliber? I'm just a clown in a cage, a sad clown who lived to make people laugh. And now sees only his own reflection. Are you coming or not? Give me a minute, I'm almost there. I'm not laughing. Why would an intergalactic Allied Commander want to escort me to a basic prison physical. We keep records of every incarcerated individual in this universe. It serves the Allies course. And I wanted to see the infamous Tickles, the clown for myself. Bullshit! You tell me the real reason or you fuck off. It would behoove interstellar security for me to lie to you. No, would it be behoove Interstellar security for you to tell me the truth? But if you change your mind dear, you know where to find me. No matter what I said, he wouldn't go along with it. There was nothing that was going to change his mind. So I left. It was a complete waste of time. So we'll move to plan B. So what's plan B, VH? We'll call the warden, have an extraction team hog tie that clown and drag him out of his cell feet first. Carry his fat ass to the infirmary and restrain him, spike his vein and draw as much blood as we need. That's what we should have done in the first place. Creating physical distress for the subject is not recommended for our purposes, Van Helsing. If it's acting restrained, the clown's body will release natural endorphins to quill the stress, pain and fear of his situation. The presence of these endorphins may interfere with the creation of the new serum. God damn! I know I'm just a Sasquatch in the hall, but can somebody please borrow that mumbo jumbo down and explain what the fuck the doc is talking about. Relaxed Foot, it'll all makes sense soon. VH is right Bigfoot. For now we need to decide our next move. Our surveillance shows that the Illuminati Army is hard at work in the current star system, building a bigger, better headquarters destroyer than before. If we don't act fast, they'll return with a vengeance and they'll be stronger than ever. Then we'll kick their asses again, and again and again. It always is the same for those scaly pricks. And it always will. This time can be different, Big foot through extensive laboratory research. We finally identified and isolated the RX Two sociopathy gene found in Illuminati DNA. By going in and mutating the gene beyond recognition, we can subvert the intentions of its hosts effectively defeating them from within. Oh, I get it, victory, but, wear sneakers shit. Man, I can dig it. So can I Foot. None of us are getting any younger. It's hard enough to squeeze it into our fighter cockpits for long stretches, not to mention the quick reflexes it takes to survive the new laser fights out there. Slowly but surely, Illuminati technology is passing us by. Pretty soon, what's left of human beings will be obsolete. They'll pick us apart remotely like virtual gamers. We can't let them complete that new destroyer. If we do, it could be the end. It won't be. We've come this far and we're not backing down. We know the Illuminati will never stop coming after us. And we've beaten them back to the point that they're immobilized. Now's the time to finish them. So forgive me if I'm missing something, but why are we fucking around with this clown. What do we need him for? Out of thousands of hours of research and experimentation, Tickles is the only individual we found whose blood possesses the genetic code to reverse the RX Two gene. Really! That fucking clown holds the antibody to the Illuminati's evil. I've heard it all now. It may be hard to believe, but it's the truth. Science doesn't lie. And since Tickles is already in custody in the Galaxy's toughest maximum security prison, he's got to be the subject we extract from. Okay, so how come we don't just trick his goofy ass, string him up, slice him open and bring him out. It sounds easy enough, I'm aware. But any synthetic tranquilizer will interfere with the genome, like dye and water. The blood must be kept clean and pure for it to be of use in manufacturing the serum. Gotcha. So what are we gonna do? Run around with syringes, sticking every one of those lizarding folks, we can find. No Bigfoot, we're already working on a zero gravity directional warhead to deliver the serum to the Illuminati sub-base incur, like a nuclear bomb. None of them will be able to run or hide. Like a bug bomb on a roach motel. Ah fucking And before we can begin engineering the RX to reverse the serum, we have to have Tickles the clown's blood free of all impurities. There's simply no other way. And I'm the only visitor Tickles has granted access to in the three years he's been held in prison. For whatever reason, he'll speak to me. I know the reason. If I was locked in a box for the rest of my natural life, I want to see a nice little piece of ass once in a while too. Hell, yeah. Many traits become arousing if one takes the time to ponder them, just saying. Don't be creepy pal. So what's our next move Kali. I'm going to visit Tickles again, gain his trust, get his blood and bring it into this God forsaken war once and for all. I'm not comfortable with you going to see that clown again, Kali. Don't like the idea of you being alone with him. It has to be done, VH. You heard Dr. Jekyll. There's no other way. There's always another way. Well, I'm in command and as long as I'm in command, I'll call the shots. We're still alive after all and the Illuminati Army is in tatters. For now, but that could all change in a heartbeat if you let your guard down, even for a split second and get too close to Tickles. Don't worry, clowns don't turn me on. I know. I care about you Kali. I don't know what I'd do if anything happened to you out there. I've never heard you talk like this VH. If I didn't know better, I'd think you were in love. Oh, how long have you felt this way? Long enough. I see. I've been under the impression you only wanted to release. What's changed your mind. I've seen enough death and destruction for one lifetime, even if I am a clone. But when I look into your eyes, just be careful out there, alright? I always am. I was shocked to hear what VH said today. And while I've been lost in his eyes for longer than I care to admit now, I've never expected him to return the sentiment. I want to stop the madness in this galaxy, all of us allies do. But one of the reasons for that is, I'm thinking more and more about kids, about the world will leave them and about humanity, not just surviving, but thriving as we once did so long ago. Maybe VH and I, there's no point thinking about this now. Before it can even be close to a reality, we have to stamp out the Illuminati. And to do that, I have to go through Tickles and his games. Princess Devine you're back. Warden. Your last visit made quite the splash with my inmates, so to speak. That means nothing to me. I'm only here to reach one inmate. Yes, and I must say your effect on him has been quite remarkable. Oh, how so? He's never been this quiet and well-behaved in the three years he's been with us. Why? I'd say he's downright docile. A ruse I'm sure. He's lulling you into a false sense of security. I know, but it won't work. Still Tickles has commonly been quite the disruptor around here. The new column surrounding him is much appreciated. If these weren't no contact visitations, I'd suspect you gave him a, you know. I'm told you've been on your best behavior lately. What's up with that? I'm doing nothing different than I've always done, Princess. I'm merely doing it in my head. I thought as much. Clowns like you don't really change, not in here anyway. Speaking of, to what do I owe the pleasure of your presence once more? I came to see if you've given any thought to my offer last time. And I wanted to let you know that it's still on the table. I'd like to put you on the table. It's not me we're talking about. Says who? Says me. Yeah, is that supposed to make me believe you're the one in charge? But I am. Says you. Were starting to go in circles again. Slow, steady ones. I'm out here, you're in there. You're right. I am in there. And where's that? Your head. If you say so. Oh, but I do. How does it feel? How does what feel? The fact that I know what you're thinking, maybe before you do. I don't believe you do, Tickles. I think you're playing games with me like you do with everyone else who gets close enough to your glass. And yet here you are, Princess. Very close to my glass, again. That's right. Wanna take a walk? I already did this morning. That's not true. You're on lockdown 23 hours a day. You get one, five minute shower a week. If you walked, you did it in there. In circles. I'll offer one more time. Come take the physical. It's not open-ended Tickles. It's now or never. Well, in that case, never. Is that your answer? If it is, what do I win? Nothing. If that's your final answer, you lose. Huh, and if I lose, you lose. What makes you say that? You want something from me. Something more important than you're letting on. You think so? I know so. I can see it in your eyes and your body language. I can smell it through these vents, the smell of desperation. You're wrong, Tickles. What I'm offering you is to get out of jail free card, but only for a little while. And you're too stupid to take it. Too stupid? Oh, flattery will get you everywhere. It sounds like we're done here. Oh, at least this way, you will go away and let me stew again, huh? In hopes that I mull over your hollow duplicitous promises and take the bait you'll soon re-offer like a good mindless captive. No, this is where I turn around and go and never come back and you rot in there, wondering why you couldn't help yourself, but to be defiant to someone who extended an olive branch to you. Oh, spoken like a little girl to the daddy who's love she so craved, but never won. Excuse me. Oh, you heard me. You're obvious, Commander. You wear it on yourself like a tight bikini under that big sexless space suit. You're just waiting for someone to reach out and pull the string, waiting for me to pull the string. You're insane. Probably, I've heard it before. But insane isn't incorrect, is it Princess? We're done here. Sergeant, open the door. You have to press the button. No one can hear you except me. There's bad shit going down on The Illuminati is doubling down on constructing a new destroyer. Our informant sent word that it is getting real close to operation before we lost contact with him. Lost contact with him? That's right. He's off the radar, MIA. We think his cover might've been blown and the slimy bastards took him out. Damn it! You missed a lot while you were playing dress up with the clowns Kali. Is that a shot at me? All I'm saying is, things are accelerating out there faster than we thought. The Allies could use a leader. They need you here, I need you here. Well, you've been with us long enough VH that you should be able to step in and take command if need be, or am I wrong about it? Burn! Is that what you want, me to assume command while you run away and join the circus? You can be a real asshole, you know that? The best. Listen up y'all, we don't need this infighting bullshit. It gets no one nowhere and fast. I will take care of them motherfuckers on Just drop me right on their camp. I'll gut as many as I can before they take me down. That's out of the question Bigfoot. You're too valuable to us. I ain't never been called valuable before. It's kind of nice. She's right Foot. You mean too much to the Allied operations and you're my right-hand Sasquatch buddy. You go in, I go in. Word. Watch surveillance closely and keep trying to reach our man on the inside. If he's captured or dead, I want confirmation. In the meantime, keep Dr. Jekyll on standby. I'll have that blood sample for him by end of day tomorrow. Is that so? Yes it is. Do you have a problem with that? Not in theory, but I'm coming with you. Not necessary. Just try to stop me. I'll have you court-martialed. No, you won't. Oh no? Try me. Hang on a sec you two. If you guys are going, I'm going too. Sounds like y'all need a calm head in the mix. Jesus Christ! Foot's become the voice of reason. We're fucked. God damn he's ugly. You got that right. This cocksucker makes me look like the sexiest Sasquatch alive. I may be a strain on the eyes, gentlemen, but I assure you, my character is forged of the toughest deal. Man, get the fuck outta here. All the dudes say that shit. Tickles, allow me to introduce my colleagues from Allied Headquarters. You may have heard of them. Jack Van Helsing. Ah, Van Helsing, how delightful to make your acquaintance, your exploits with the undead is the stuff of legend. But I must ask, how did you get that dog in here? Dog? You fat piece of up shit. I'll reach through this glass and stick that red nose up your ass. Call me a dog again. Oh, he's funny too. Hey, you ought to think about the circus. They'd sell some tickets with a freak like that. You know you big bag of shit. Settle down all of you. We're not here to argue. No, then tell me Girly, why are you all here? And after the two of us had such a report developing, huh? They say three is a crowd, but this, it's a gangbang. Watch your mouth fuck face. I'll open that cell and put my boot in it. Yeah! This isn't going the way I intended. The best laid plans of mice and men often go awry. Now, I see the bitch and I smell the bitch. So my question is, which of you is the man and which is the mouse? Or are you both mice who take your marching orders from the commander? Fuck this clown. Let's drop him and take his blood. I couldn't agree more. Sergeant open this cell. Enough! Out, both of you. Wait for me in the star cruiser. I'll speak with Tickles alone. Just the way I like it. Maybe we went to farther VH. Too far? The only way we might've gone too far is we gutted that piece of shit like the pig he is then roll around in the blood and play catch with his bloated organs. Really? That actually sounds fun. Whatever, Kali is in charge. And she's dealt with that clown more than we have. She knows what she's gotten herself into and knows what she's doing, I hope. Yeah, so do I. I'd like to apologize for my colleagues behavior Tickles. That's not how we normally operate and not why we came. Oh, why'd you come back Kali. I thought we concluded our business last time. I came to see if you changed your mind. Again? Oh my, what a long leash I have! Long, but not endless. You see we're on a timeframe, Tickles. A timeframe for what? To do what needs to be done. Now you're the one talking in circles, Princess. The Illuminati Army is in exile, licking their wounds. So am I. And if this isn't exile, I don't know what is. I love licking my wounds, especially when they're fresh. Listen to me. The Illuminatis is are down, but not out. As we speak, they're preparing to return stronger than ever. Sounds like a worthy adversary, if you ask me. No war can last forever or should. We're looking to put an end to it this time, to put an exclamation point on this page in human history. And you'd like me to rub a little snot on it? If you like. You're never getting out of here, Tickles. You and I both know that. There's no reason to pretend otherwise. But working with the Allies could make your time considerably more comfortable. You wanna make me more comfortable, Kali? Allow me to explain. Please do. The scientists aboard our mothership have discovered a sociopathy gene found in Illuminati DNA. This gene can be mutated, spliced if you will, and altered in the most basic biological level to serve an entirely different function. However, in order to make the change, a serum must be created. And to do that, a specific genetic code must be present in the blood. This code can be found in only .01 of living creatures in our galaxy today. After reviewing medical records of those incarcerated in our galaxy, we've discovered that you're one of the few with the blood code we're looking for. Are you listening to what I'm saying? What are you doing? I'm undressing you with my eyes. Enough with the games. Oh, but it's not a game, Kali. Strip for me. Excuse me. Do a striptease. It's been a while. And your body, oh God! I can only imagine, and I am. I wont strip for you Tickles. I still hold all the cards. We need your blood desperately, but we don't bargain with psychopaths. And yet that's exactly what you've been doing. No, I haven't. I've given you nothing and promised you nothing but a walk, some fresh air and a change of scenery in exchange for some blood. So the truth comes out, you need me. I don't need you. What if we amended your sentence, offered the possibility of parole. Oh, I thought you weren't bargaining. The Allies have a way with the warden and the board. Play along and I can see to it there's a light at the end of the tunnel for you that isn't there now. Show me your fucking tits. Give me some blood. Yours or mine. The clock is ticking Tickles. Time's running out. Those tits and bounce. If I do, you consent to a blood draw? It depends. They're real, right? No padded bra. 100% real. Show me, then you can pick a vain. I can't believe this Foot. What the hell is taking so long? Why does he keep giving that creep the time? We're fighting a war here. I agree, it don't make no sense, VH. But Kali is in command. You don't have to tell her shit if she don't want to. That's the thing, she usually does. She's confided a lot in me. I thought our rapport was deeper than this. It's like that fucking clown has come between us. Half the time, she doesn't even sound like herself. You sound like a school boy with a crush, my dude. I'm in love with her, Foot. Whoa, what! It's like nothing I've felt before. It's indescribable. Bro, listen though, you remember that old earth song, "Love Stinks?" Yeah, yeah. Well, that ain't no love. Look at me, I don't mess around with matters of the heart. You know what that makes me? What? Happy. But finding some little she wolf on my job, you know what I'd be? Miserable. Bingo. Who needs the trouble? We got enough on our plates. Hell, we don't know if we'll still be breathing one minute to the next. It's not like I planned it, Foot. It just happened, I'm not sure when. Well, look, everybody knows you two been fucking. It's the worst kept secret at headquarters. But I was expecting you two to walk down the aisle. Who said anything about marriage? What's the point of it even? We have no society, no planet to return to. We're space rogues but the heart's a tricky thing. That's why I ripped those fuckers out, eat 'em and smile. Don't worry about it, Foot. The only time I'm even at ease really is when she's safe, aboard the mothership. And even then, one trapper missile fire can wipe her out, wipe us all out in the blink of an eye. What's it good for? What the hell was I thinking? I actually fell for that clown's bullshit. Never again. Well, how'd it go. I'm finished with Tickles, doctor. I've done all I can do. Tried every trick in the book. I even explained our situation and why we need him, but he doesn't give a damn. Boy, I'm glad to hear this. Fuck that clown. This is unfortunate news, Kali. But we still have some recourse. We do? Explain doctor. If we can somehow get into Tickles' holding cell and stick him with one of our new rapid extraction needles, we might get the amount of blood we need to engineer the genome reversal serum. If it's done right, we have the blood before Tickles even know what happened. Hold on, hold on. You mean to tell me, one of us goes in the cell, cell door locks, clown is in the cell, our clown. You got any better suggestions? Kali Devine, what a surprise! I thought your work was done here. So did I. Turns out I was wrong. Very well. You're always welcome in my prison. You see, I have a question for you. Upon routine review of the facility surveillance cameras, our night shift officers discovered some rather interesting footage from Tickles' cell. I bet they did. What was going on there, if I may ask. You may not. Anything that transpires between your prisoners and myself or any members of my fleet is official Allied business and will be treated as confidential. No, don't worry, my lips are sealed. Good keep them sealed. Of course. See, Kali, when you're done with your official business, I have a bottle of bourbon barrel aged merlot up in my office. Why don't you come up and relax for a spill, unwind. Thanks for the offer Warden, but I'll pass. Come now, don't let the cold sterile environments of the cellblocks fool you. That's how the other half lives, the inmates. My quarters are quite comfortable, I assure you. I said no, don't ask me again. Duly noted. Well, if it ain't the bouncing commander, good day, lovely. Tickles, I trust your night went well. Very. The images in my head inform the wee hours in ways you wouldn't believe. I'm glad to hear it. Have you reconsidered my offer? Reconsidered? I told you yesterday, I'm not interested, but you can put on a show for me again, if you like. It's funny you mentioned it, Tickles because that's exactly what I was thinking. Oh! Only, how about something a little more interactive this time. You do know how to get a clown's attention, don't you? Don't be coy. I had your attention from the moment I showed my face. And other things. I'd like to show more. Is that so? Yes, you coerced me into doing something I didn't want to do yesterday, but it wasn't unpleasant. Go on. It's been a long time fighting this war with the Illuminati, Tickles. I'm a fighter and a leader like my father before me, but I'm still a woman and it's lonely out there. Yeah, what about the roughneck you brought with you yesterday? VH? What about him? He crackled with desire for you. It was all over his body language 'coursing through his space suit. Right, me and every other female in the Allied Forces, and I think a few males too. VH means nothing to me. Yeah? You might tell him that. He should probably know. I give him orders, that's the extent of our relationship. Other than that, I don't care where he puts his dick. So what brings you back to me, Princess? You were very upset when we parted ways yesterday. I thought I was never going to see you again, with open eyes, that is. I thought the same thing, but I can't seem to get you off my mind. You're a fascinating man, Tickles. A Pandora's box of surprises. I've heard that before. I bet you have. The more I think about it, the more I realize that your insights, well, sometimes erratic, are nothing of brilliant. Oh, I couldn't agree more. And I must admit, since our last meeting, I've been dreadfully curious about something. You have? What's that? Are you shaved, trimmed, waxed or wild? What do you think? I think you're a tease, is what I think Kali. Is that so? Maybe I'll open this cell and you can find out. Oh, by all means, please do. I'd enjoy nothing more than to lay you down right here on my cold cell floor, under these harsh fluorescent lights, spread your smooth legs, open wide and snap your pretty neck. I'm not so sure about that last part. Oh, but I am. I like my meals to be dead before they hit my plate. Unless you think I'll fall further for your tricks, think again. Step one toe in this cell and I'll bite it clean off. That's not why I came back Tickles. But it's why you'll leave again, Commander. I'm through sharing with you. You think you've got me hooked in you're really but it's me who's got you on the hook. If that's the way you want it, I'm trimmed. I know. I can smell its sweet musty waft. Your lips are moist like morning do on Rose pedals. You have a way with words. As do you, all lies all the time. And if you think, I don't know you plan to come in here and stick me with a quick draw needle, you're dumber than you look. Bounce it around like a new marionette, popping on command. Some leader you are. The Allies are doomed. The future belongs to the Illuminati. If that's how you feel, I guess there's nothing more to say. Great! I was just dozing off when your stench of despair, wafted through my vents. If you'll excuse me, I like you better in my dreams, headless and splayed beneath me. Have fun with them. Goodbye. Leaving already? My business here is done Warden. He's all yours. Have you given any more thought to my offer? I have, and I think I'm done with offers for a long time. No, I'm sorry to hear that. You know, I've always thought you were a very intriguing person. You're right, I am. So long, Warden. Can I talk to you? Okay, about what? I wanted to apologize. You were right. I was pinning too many of our hopes on that clown and it was nothing but a dead end. Well, it's nice to hear you say it. The more time you spend around Tickles, the more he was gonna fuck with your head. But I think you have come to that conclusion on your own soon enough. Regardless, I feel like it was driving a wedge between us and the Allied course is far too important for that. If you and I falter, the whole of humanity falters. Ain't we a pair? Indeed. Well, I'll let you get back to your workout. It's okay. I was just going to finish up and hit the shower. The shower, huh? Want some company? I can't describe what I'm feeling. I know VH wants to be with me now and only me. I never thought he'd be able to stop his roaming not long enough to realize I've been right here the whole time. Together, the two of us hold the future of the human race in our hands. And yet something is pushing me away from him just when he's finally falling for me. I always thought that if just took that step and met me halfway, our lives would suddenly have meaning again. Now, here we are and things feel more empty than ever. But he's VH, the same man I've dreamt about and lusted after since this war began so long ago. Well, he's a third generation clone actually, but he only gets better with each iteration, more rugged, more masculine, more of a leader. And I know he'd be a great father. So why does it feel like looking into the eyes of a stranger when he holds me? It's like, everything is familiar, his touch, his feel, his smell, his taste, but there's something else. Something knowing at me Like something's suddenly jamming our signal, a signal that used to be so strong. What the hell is going on? Oh, I can't put my food on it. So I'm gonna just stay right back at HQ. I used to think we was such a strong team, had our shit together. But the way that things have been going lately, I'm worried about the Allies' future and my place in it. There's no reason for this to be so hard. The Illuminati is a ground that won't even be a threat to us till they get that new destroyer up and running. We should just bomb their scaly asses while we still got the chance. Finish this thing! Instead, we're fucking around with some clown and everybody's getting weird. Huh, humans! Paid for it. Krasko, what the hell do you want? The time draws near Sasquatch. Soon, the beast world shall rise here and reclaim what's rightfully ours. Man, you still talking that revolution bullshit. When are you gonna learn? So long as the Allies and the Illuminatis are around, y'all beast ain't gonna rise up and do shit. You're wrong, Bigfoot. And while my invitation won't stand forever, the beasts will. Join us while you still can, Sasquatch. Don't be caught on the wrong side of history. Right now, I'm just caught on the wrong side of this fucking spree. How'd you get this number anyway? Werewolves have our ways. We're always watching, always waiting. And when our enemies least expect it, we strike. Hey, you know, why don't you head down and take out those Illuminati soldiers? They got no wings, just stuck like sitting ducks. I like the way you think, Bigfoot. You belong with us. Me, I must have I only stuck with the Allies 'cause they kept the refrigerator stuffed to the grills. I never snack so much in my whole life. You know well mostly on berries and greens. Sure, once in a while, a stray hiker got lost and I got to eviscerate him. But even those got fewer and farther between after the great war kicked off. Join us, and I promise you you'll have all the victims you can handle. That's the thing Crosko. I ain't really looking to work that hard no more. Just give me a self bed and a full belly, I'm happy than a pig in shit. Why hunt things that run from you if you don't have to? Haven't you always Sasquatch? But when the beasts do rise and revolution is underway, the door will close. You'll be on that side, we'll be on this side. Guess, we'll have to wait and see. There's big trouble brewing out there, boy. Pretty soon, it's gonna come down all around us. I sure hope Kali got her head screwed on straight. Just what kind of facility are you running here, Warden? You let your staff behave like animals? Did you hear them out there? Yes, Kali, I heard them, but you know, they're red blooded men and women and they have a somewhat different perception of you since the security footage made the rounds. Made the rounds? What are you running in out like a movie? Not at all, but they don't call this the gag and tag gulag for nothing. This is a maximum security prison, not a library. Thanks for the reminder, but I'm aware of that. And I'm also aware that the security footage here is Allied property. That means all of it. And it's not to be seen by anyone other than myself, you or any assigns we deem fit. Well, that's all well and good in theory, Kali, but in practice, maybe keep your clothes on from here on out, yeah? Huh! Princess Kali, what a surprise! Hardly. You knew I was coming, probably before I did. Well, I'll always make you come Commander. To what do I owe the pleasure this time? Our time's almost up out there. Surveillance shows the Illuminati new destroyers, newly operational. It may only be a matter of hours now. Oh, tick, tock, tick, tock. That's not funny, Tickles. I told you I'm a sad clown. Clearly. You're not gonna try to go coerce me into giving blood again, are you? No, that ship has sailed. It's too late anyway. Even if we drained every drop out of your body right now, our lab wouldn't have the time to engineer the serum before the Illuminati's new headquarters is an orbit. The whole point was to seek attack while they were stranded in the car star system. Like shooting fish in a battle. If you like. And without that element of surprise, it'll only be another outer space dog fight. A fair fight. What a drag! It is when you've been waging war as long as we have, every time it looks as though the end might be in sight, the line moves back. Oh, such as life on the front lines. Hey, tell me something Kali. Do you recognize just how close you Allies are to your foes, the dastardly Illuminati? Close, hardly. There are no parallels between us. Oh, but that's where you're wrong. You fight to build, shape, prosper. They fight to destroy, pervert and elate. From where I stand, you are two sides of the same coin. And you stand in an airtight prison cell, you haven't seen the galaxy outside in years and you never will again. You like saying that. Saying what? All the things I'll never do again. What makes you so sure? Because we locked you up and threw away the key because you refused every deal that would even to let you step outside that cell for a short time, because you'll never be transferred or paroled. You're gonna waste away behind the glass until the day you stop breathing. And when you do, they'll cremate your corpse on the spot, sweep up your ashes in a dust pan and dismantle the cell. In an hour, this room will be completely empty, like you were never there at all, like you never existed. Oh, such an imagination. I see why you are the leader of the Valley and Allies. That's only one of the reasons. Alright! The other being you inherited the spot from the father who never loved you. Is that supposed to make me feel bad, get me thinking about my worth? You said it, not me. Yes, I did. And I thought about it more times than I can remember. But you want to know the conclusion I came to. There you go again, always coming. I realized I was a good daughter to my father. I was everything he ever could have wanted. Only what he wanted was a boy and I couldn't give him that. Well, use your imagination. I see boys who become girls and girls who become boys all the time in here. I bet you do. All the stories I could tell, I'll spend the most horrific while feeling those titties. Wanna step in here and sit on my lap? No, thanks. Just as well. Imagine what guard staff will think of you then? They already trade your security tape like a bottle of whiskey in a 20th century speakeasy. Good for them. They might be on the other side of the cell doors, but they're no less in prison than you are. It makes sense the mentalities wouldn't be that far apart. My! You're volleying today. And where did this sudden strength of will come from? I've always had it. I just faltered. Well, we all go a little mad sometimes, don't we Kali? Some more than others. I feel the time to successfully engineer the RX Two serum, has run out, doctor. The new Illuminati destroyer has taken flight. Yes, I'm afraid the small window that was available to us is now closed. They'll find it soon enough. And when they do, who knows what new and terrible weaponry they'll have at their disposal. We've never failed before, doctor. I'm not sure if I like the feeling. What! we haven't failed this time either, and we never will. We have science on our side, equations, concoctions, inventions. None of it will make any difference if we're soon blasted into star dust, doctor. Then we mustn't allow ourselves to be. But we're not in control. We can't exert any influence whatsoever over commander Kali's actions. You're right, we can't. Only the clown seemed able to accomplish that, what I wouldn't give for his brain. His brain, what would you do with it, doctor? Construct myself another assistant of course. But I'm your assistant. Yes, I know. And I think we're going about as far as we can, with your limited skillsets. I see. Perhaps we can negotiate a prisoner transfer and bring Tickles aboard our mothership for psychological testing and neurological studying. I imagine it would be out of the question, doctor. Commander Kali holds superiority over the one warden presence. And a transfer request from her would surely be heeded. After all, the clown is just sitting there. Get out! No! Allies, code black, officer is down. Tickles, the clown has escaped. I repeat, Tickles is loose. He's in a stolen transport cruiser and armed. Oh dear, this is dreadful news. Princess Kali, come in. I'm here Heru, what is it? We just received a distress call from the gag and tag gulag, code black with officers down and one on the loose. It's Tickles, he's escaped. No! God damn it! We can't let that son of a bitch get away. us to the prisons airspace at once, Bort. Yes, mom. I'm firing up the hammer of God, Kali. Go, maybe we can catch him before he gets out of orbit, but watch your back. The clown's insane. I'll be fine. Keep the lights on for me. This won't take long. Be careful VH. I'm always careful Princess. Foot, come in. I'm here, my dude. Bad news, Tickles escaped. He's on the loose. Get the fuck outta here. Are you shitting me? We've got to find that fat fuck, and fast. No kidding? I'm on it. Where are you? I'll pick you up. I'm in the hammer. No time, besides two is better than one. We could flake him. Blast his big ass to hell. Good idea. They're saying he coming near the prison transport cruiser. He'll be easy to spot. Even better. Let's do this. Watch yourself Foot, he's dangerous. My head's up VH. You do you. Deal. Get him, big guy. My, how the galaxy has changed. Oh, the space debris? Disgusting! I wonder how my favorite commander is doing. Hello, Princess. I guess no more visits for us. Tickles, what have you done? What I should've done a long time ago, stepped out for some fresh air. You won't get far. Says who? Listen to me, Tickles. Every Allied vessel within three light years is on high alert. We're canvassing the galaxy to its furthest reaches. You can't run, you can't hide. Then I guess you leave me no choice, but to fight. You'll loose. We'll see. Take that cruiser back and turn yourself in. I'll see to it you don't receive additional punishment. You mean on top of the life sentence I was serving like a bug under a glass? Thanks sweetheart, but I think I'll take my chances. I'm not your sweetheart Tickles, and you're out of chances. The only way this ends is with you dead. There you go again with the absolutes. You know, I just love your one track mind. Maybe I'll steal aboard your mother ship while you're sleeping and wake you with a nice deep skull fuck. And maybe we'll see you streaking across the stars and hit you with our microwave lasers. We can turn that ship into an oven and cook your insides for minutes. Make you die, slow and screaming. Wow! I didn't think you had it in you, baby. This is getting fun. Speak for yourself. I'll see you soon. Ta ta, Kali. Shit! Look around VH, my radar was picking up a space police issue Cruiser at your 10 o'clock. I'm with you Foot. I've got it in my sights. You think it's him? The ship's ID says David 14, unregistered listing. But there's an easy way to find out. Let's shake him down. Yo, motherfucker in the police issue, identify yourself. Oh, police in commissary delivery. What's your name and badge number? Agent Pogo here. Badge number 666. That's him VH. Bingo assholes. What a play! Hold on if we do fatso. Foot, check your six. Reinforcements just arrived. Alright, go get him, that ass. That's right, assholes. Come and get it. We lost him. Where did he go? I don't know, he just. VH, behind you. VH, no! Oh, look at that monstrosity. Now that's a warship. Looks like you Allies have your hands full. why don't I just skidaddle and lead you to it, huh? You face piece of dog shit. You killed my best friend. Mark my words, you're gonna look into my eyes some days soon. And when you do, I'll tear you limb from limb. Count on it cocksucker. Promise, I'm looking forward to it. VH come in, VH. Princess Kali, I'm afraid he's gone. No, he's not. That's Jack Van Helsing we're talking about. It'll take more than some psycho in a clown suit to beat him. VH, can you hear me? Come in. Bort is correct ma'am. The hammer of God was destroyed. There's nothing left. Then he jettisoned at the last second. He's done it before. Call the stars. He could be floating out there. Princess, he's dead. It's been hours now and I can't process this. I feel like he's going to walk through that door any second and take me in his arms every footstep. Every muffled voice I hear, all sounds like him. I can't believe it ends like this, shot down by a psychopathic fugitive circus clown, who to anyone's knowledge had never even graded to star cruiser before. It just doesn't compute. Things were so good between us lately, before Tickles entered the picture. VH was talking about the future, about the wars end, about us. I was ready to bear his children, and now it's all over. The most vivid memory I have though, one that will stay with me forever is our escape from enemy headquarters after defeating the Illuminati, yet again, It was just VH and I. The rest of the galaxy had fallen away. We weren't even sure if we'd survive, spinning aimlessly in the un-detonated megaton bomb. And in those precious moments, we didn't care. We clung to every minute, we clung to each other and nothing else mattered. He's gone now. And with him, all those future plans we both secretly looked forward to. Humanity will live on, I'll live on and the Illuminati will fall, but things will never be the same. Things will never be the same again. At last, through my performance of the the sixth month of black magic ritual that no one has dared, to undertake in centuries, doesn't gain no bonus. Now is the dawn of the new dark age, and I the immortal undisputed leader of the Illuminati army once more rise. What a story to life as mine! In my immortal shadow, I conquered the earth. And those small feats meant so much to me then. Hello, quarrels and the of human existence, I came to Mount Letting my parted ice screaming around me in an escape of a latter lunch whilst I sipped tea in a tent and rummaged through their belongings. I shot a youthful pickpocket dead in Calcutta simply for rushing against me in a marketplace. If he'd wanted to brush against me in private, he didn't need only ask and I'd have bored holes in his soft Upon transcending the mortal coil, I fostered colts the galaxy over to file the union of man and woman whilst savoring the taboo, man on man and no man and beast relations. I've smoked over and shared heroin with kings, queens and criminals alike, led children to magic and magic to children. And now with our new and fully operational, I'll destroy alien flight. The last of the human virus shall be stamped out and perish beneath the Illuminati put hell. How delightfully profane it would be to piss in of all those failed Allied fighters. Then sever their heads from their bodies with my sight and drink my own urine from their rotting skull chalices. Who does disturb the great beast? Just me Maggis, a lonesome traveling clown, looking for a good time. Looking for a good time? I'll show you a good time, Harlequin. Yeah, I was hoping you'd say that. Come to my back door, it's always open. I'll pour us some psychedelic tea and you can show me how to brotherly massage crease paint. Oh, I use cream makeup. It doesn't crease. How fascinating! Even in my eternal reptilian form, I learn new things all the time. I'll teach you some tricks too if you want. Like how to slaughter Allies and carve fresh flesh Well, I don't know where you came from But come on board at once, I wish to make your acquaintance. Don't mind if I do. I'm sure you've all heard the news by now. One of our brightest shining allies, Jack van Helsing is dead, but rest assured we'll fight on in VH's name. The Illuminatis are back stronger than ever. And we can be sure they'll strike soon. If they think we're weakened or not prepared for them, they'll have another thing coming. Fuck yeah, it's Clobberin time Commander Kali, I wish to offer my condolences on your loss. I thought highly of VH, we all did. He was my homie, straight up. He was quite the man. Yes he was. And I'll miss him, but we must go on. The human race depends on it. Kali, I sincerely hope I haven't overstepped my bounds, but I have something to show you. Something we've been working on the past 24 hours. As you know, we keep frozen DNA samples of every allied member for medical as well as scientific purposes. Yes, I'm aware of that. Sounds sketchy to me. You ain't got mine, do you? We do. What! Destroy it now or else I will. Then I'll pop your head like a pimple motherfucker. Relaxed Foot, we're on the same side. You can trust the lab. Kali, I'm a wild beast, you feel me? The day I trust the lab is the day I forfeit my Sasquatch card. I assure you Bigfoot, no harm will ever find you through my laboratory, not while I'm in charge. See what he did there? He put a disclaimer on it, not while he's in charge. If somebody like takes over, I'm fucked. Take it easy Bigfoot. If it means that much to you, we can discuss safely removing your DNA sample from the doctor storage later. Word. Continue Dr. Jekyll, you were saying? I was saying VH was a very valuable Ally. I also know you had feelings for him. So I took it upon myself to regenerate another clone from his DNA. No, shit! I didn't think you'd mind. I see. Is it complete? Very nearly. With all our technological advances, the process is considerably faster. We can generate an exact clone in less than a sun rotation. He should be awake anytime now. Shall we take a look? Yes, let's. Right this way. That's my boy. Is he? His vital signs indicate that he's aware. Speak to him. VH, can you hear me? Welcome back little buddy. Where am I? You're among friends. Friends. And this is your woman. Y'all are as hot as hot How do you feel VH? Horny.
