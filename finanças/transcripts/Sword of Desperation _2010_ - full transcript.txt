Renko! Renko! Renko! Renko! Renko! Renko! Lord, go back! Lord! Lady Renko... Renko! Kane'mon...... Why have you done this? I place myself in your hands. Sword of Desperation Please. May I see Sir Sanzaémon? No One Can See him until we are Commanded otherwise. Even One of his relatives? Even one of his relatives? Absolutely not! Absolutely not! Please make an exception. Absolutely not! Please make an exception. Please make an exception. NO! It is I, Rio. Father. What kind of judgment will Sir Sanzaemon receive? Not only will he be beheaded, but our family line Will be abolished. it's inevitable. Trouble Will befall our entire family, then? Why would Sir Sanzaémon do such a thing? There is no way for us to know what was on his mind. But had Lady Mutsue been alive, this would have never happened. Chief Inspector. I vaguely remember Kanemi, but... what kind of man is he? He is known to be serious, trustworthy, and most self-composed. Why then would such a self-composed man do this? Were there any prior indications? Kanemi never expressed hostility towards the Lord or Lady Renko, or disgruntlement about fief policy. “(Go-)Bekke:“ A member of the cadet branch of a family; used to refer to Sir Obiya. What about his relative, Sir Obiya Hayato-no-sho; could he be connected to this? There seems to be no connection Whatsoever. So you're saying that he acted alone? That is SO. Does Kanémi have a family? His Wife became ill and died, and he has no children. Since he has no heir, he's prepared for the abolishment of his family line. Kanémi is worth 280-koku, is that correct? Correct.. If only we could allow him to commit hara-kiri. But beheading will probably be appropriate. I believe I must object. Kanémi Sanzaemon.. Your outbreak of madness the other day at the Main Hall was the height of insolence. However, given your subsequent unresisting behavior, it is our Lord's wish... ...that you be granted special clemency. Based on that, judgment shall now be passed. Kanemi Sanzaemon, you are sentenced to one year of house arrest. Your fief pension will be reduced from 280-koku to 130-koku. Furthermore, you are relieved of your post as an Infantry Captain, and all other official posts. That is all. Please Wait. Please wait. Sanzaemon.. Refrain ! I have killed a person precious to our Lord. I was prepared to be beheaded. Sanzaemon.! Sanzaemon.! Disallowed. Our Lord has judged your case himself. No arguments to the contrary are permitted. Uncle.. Master.. Do as you have been instructed. Thank you for all you've done for us, all these years. Take good care of yourselves, you two. Thank you very much. Come On. Uncle. I have brought you supper. Rio. YES. Yes. What are your plans? Given our family situation, you should consider what to do with yourself. Uncle. After the annulment of my betrothal, I had nowhere to go but back to my original home. But out of Aunt Mutsue's kindness, I was allowed to live here. Then EVEN more SO... Then EVEN more SO... Please. I do not want to go anywhere else. Please permit me to continue to remain here with you. Spirit Tablet of Believer Kotoku Jomutsu (Kanemi Mutsue) Welcome home. Welcome home. How is Mutsue feeling? Well, her fever has gone down today. She seems to be feeling much better than yesterday. I See. Welcome home. You should lie down if you want, don't mind me. Your color is looking much better than it was this morning. Yes. The coughing stopped. I'm feeling much better. I See. Dear... Please open the shoji for me. Oh yes... Sir Hoshina told me of a therapeutic hot spring that's effective against sickness. Why don't you go and give it a try? I'm already dismayed enough because I haven't been able to care for you. I couldn't do that. You needn't be concerned about me. Get well as soon as possible. That's all I want. Hana. Hana. Yes? Yes? Let's grow some vegetables in the garden. Yes? Let's grow some vegetables in the garden. Let's grow some vegetables in the garden. I can't do it alone. I can't do it alone. I'm going to do it. I just want your help, Hana. I can't do it alone. I'm going to do it. I just want your help, Hana. I'm going to do it. I just want your help, Hana. Yes. How has our Lord been lately? I hear he has been making regular visits to the inner sanctum, even early in the day. Seems like he's falled head over heels for that women. I hope he doesn't get swayed by her mendacity yet again. Fat chance. Our Lord only has eyes and ears for that woman. This is what I heard... Lady Renko. You are not allowed to go there. Please stop, Lady Renko. Lately she can't bear to wait for him at the inner sanctum... ...so she goes in person to the high council chambers. Can you believe it? They say she scribbled all over the austerity budget and made it a hollow shell. What are you so worried about? Let's deny number 4. “Petition for a reduction in the cuisine budget.” “Denied” I don't think we need number 5 either. “Petition for a reduction in the budget for periodic festivities and formal gifting.“ Why are the chief retainers letting her get away with this? Even if they were to make a complaint, I'm sure our Lord would have none of it. Because if he did, he'd get shunned by Lady Renko. Hey. I just heard that Accountant Anzai slit his stomach. W...What? W...What? What for? What for? Rumor from the castle has if... What for? Lady Renko. YOU mustn't.. Lady Renko... Which one of you is Accountant Anzai? Lady Renko. I am Anzai. What brings you to a place like this? I heard you have proposed to our Lord that the budget for the inner sanctum be reduced. Oh no, I would never be so audacious. And you told him to cut this year's Noh play at Shungakuden Hall. Is this not true? The farmers are in distress because of the river's great flood this summer. Reconstruction has proven to be more arduous than anticipated... ...hence I expressed an opinion in the hope that funds could be shifted in that direction. Are you saying that you would deny our Lord his pleasures? I also hear that you're complaining that our kimonos are an extravagance. We serve to entertain our Lord. Are you saying that we are a waste? Oh no. I had no such intention, whatsoever. Silence, silence! You're trying to cover for your incompetence as an accountant... ...and have ultered fabrications. The fief's finances are in disarray solely because of your neglectfulness. Slit your stomach. Your stomach. Lady Renko. Your responsibility is great; you have administered the fief's treasury incompetently. This is the Will of our Lord. Slit your stomach. Lord! Lord! Sir Anzai. Sir Anzai. Please get back. Get back. Lord! Lord! Is what Lady Renko said truly your command? Please get back, Sir Anzai. Sir Anzai. Lord! Lord! Please. Lord Lord! Lord... And that's what happened, I hear. For such 8 trifle... Sir Kanémi. Let's go have a drink. Come keep me company. Poor Sir Anzai. Everyone's in a foul mood lately. All I ever seem to hear... ...are nothing but gripes and grievances about our Lord and fief governance. It's like a disease. I hear that even Sir Tsuda is at a loss. I wish we had a remedy, but we don't. Everyone's helpless. All they can do is wait for the time. The time? The time when our Lord grows weary of that woman. Do you know about the enmity between our Lord and Sir Obiya? NO. It concerns the reconstruction of Koboku temple. Koboku temple? Apparently, our Lord's clan has deep connections to this temple. It was concerning this that Sir Obiya paid our Lord a visit the other day. SO, Sir Tsuda. Sir Obiya, you have returned from Edo. Let's skip the formalities. There's an issue I must directly discuss with our Lord. Let me See him. Lord, you must have lost your senses. Koboku temple is an utterly obsolete temple. Obiya Hayato-no-sho, Lord's relative Koboku temple is an utterly obsolete temple. Obiya Hayato-no-sho, Lord's relative Obiya Hayato-no-sho, Lord's relative No matter how deep a connection you might have had with it, Lord... No matter how deep a connection you might have had with it, Lord... ...I cannot understand why you would want to reconstruct it. The cost of reconstruction would be tremendous. Given our financial difficulties, this project is not a necessity. You're dissatisfied with my decision, is that what you're saying? I have been told that this idea was conceived in the inner sanctum, Lord. And that when the work is finished, the father of your consort is to be installed as the abbot. Sir Obiya, I fear that you should not speak of such matters to our Lord... I want to ask you directly, if these things are true. How outrageous. I have never heard of a consort being permitted entry into the council room of a Lord. I gave permission. Sir Obiya. Does it bother you that a woman is here with you? On top of that, you must be bothered that I have a say in governmental affairs. The fief is in dire financial straits. It would be vexatious to fender if more destitute. The reconstruction of the temple has always been our Lord's wish. The funds will not just be spent on builders and lumber. All who are involved in the project will benefit. In short, it will be a means for the fief to profit. You are being completely illogical. As are you, Sir Obiya. You are a retainer without responsibilities, so you don't appreciate our Lord's burdens. I don't want you frivolously meddling in fief affairs. Silence! This is not the concern of a mere consort. Insolence.. You might be family but you are not in charge. I've had enough of your opinions! Hayato-no-sho, withdraw. Withdraw! When it comes to standing up to our Lord, there's no one with more clout than Sir Obiya. But he would not listen to anything Sir Obiya had to say. His leadership has become infected. It's filled with the pus of that woman's poison. Sir Den'ichiro, you're really good at fishing, aren't you? I haven't fished in a long time, but I haven't lost my skills. There. By the way, Rio. Anything to report about Sir Sanzaémon? Well... Nothing's changed. Rio, you're the only one who can care for Sir Sanzaemon. Please continue to do so. YES. I've been thinking, Sir Den'ichiro... Could it be that uncle killed Lady Renko because he was looking for a chance to die? Why would you think that? It's nothing. I just sensed it,that’s all. That was uncalled for. My apologies. It's starting to taste just like the late missus' used to make. It's Rio... I feel unusually good today. It's not good for you to be indoors all the time. How truly refreshing. My turn. How feisty. When I was a kid, we were taught to do “bird spearing“ like that, to train our bodies. But I kind of feel sorry for the bird. Was that wrong of me? Was that wrong of me? You're so kind, auntie. Announcement. I, Kanami Seizo, am here as summoned. Declaration to chief of family, Kanami Seizo. As of today, Kanami Sanzaemon is no longer under house arrest. You have endured much hardship on my behalf, Rio. My apologies for being such a burden to you for so long. I'm glad that you're in the clear, and released from house arrest. We relatives are concerned about your future prospects. But first I'd like to hear what you yourself think. Sanzaemon.. Uncle. I'll wash your back. Never mind. No. You cannot wash off a year's worth of grime all by yourself. Please don't be hesitant. I must smell. NO. Sir Den'ichiro and others are saying they can't wait to see you. Please refuse any visitors. I don't want to see anyone just yet. I've told uncle the same. He called me an ingrate, but permitted me this self-indulgence. I just want to walk around the fief, alone, for a while. Please give this petition to our Lord. We've had a horrible harvest, and the annual levy is much too high. We might as well be told to die. Denied. The decision is final. Please. How insolent, to try to force a petition upon our honored Lord! You Will all be beheaded. Doesn't our Lord spare any thought for our lives? You are being insolent. Withdraw! Withdraw! Please think it over, just this once! Listen. Listen. The farmers are ignoring grave prohibitions... ...taking up hoes and bamboo spears, and threatening to complain to Edo. We absolutely prohibit this. All of you know what to do. Lady Renko sparked this riot. Lady Renko sparked this riot. Her again? Her again? Yeah... Her again? The administrators increased the annual levy for Akaishi county, based on her suggestion. Akaishi is the top rice grower in Unasaka. Its levy must've been higher than anywhere else. Their goal is to drum up funding for rebuilding that ramshackle temple. The Koboku temple thing... Is this going to turn into a battle? It's all up to Sir Obiya now. Everything's riding on Sir Obiya's decision. Why are you nervous? If those lousy Akaishi farmers disobey you, my Lord... ...you should behead them all, without a single exception. Sir Obiya! sir Obiya! Hold it, all of you. Please withdraw for HOW. Sir Obiya. The way things are, we'll all starve to death. It's not advantageous for you to riot at this time. There will be consequences. We're ready to suffer the consequences. We're ready to suffer the consequences. Sir Obiya. Sir Obiya. I have already relayed your request to our Lord. Sir Obiya. I won't let you down. Sir Obiya, can we put our trust in you? All of you. Halt. All of you. The Akaishi county riot has been tentatively pacified. Your orders have been rescinded. Your great efforts are appreciated. NO! NO! NO! Dad, Mom! Sir Obiya! Koboku Temple Keisui-in .Juno Renju Daishi (Renko) You are Sir Kanémi Sanzaémon, are you not? And you are? I was Lady Renko's servant. My name is Taé. Now I keep vigil over her divine spirit. There was something I wanted to ask you, perchance we should meet. Sir Kanemi. Why did you kin Lady Renko? Two years later Official business. Official business. Uncle, the messenger of the Deputy Chief Retainer, Sir Tsuda, has delivered this. From Sir Tsuda? Kanemi Sanzaemon. Your stipend of 130-koku shall be returned to 280-koku as it was before. You are commanded to assume the post of Chief Bodyguard. Chief Bodyguard? Me? Correct. Two years have passed since your release from house arrest... ...yet I hear you have severed communication with your relatives, and are refusing to have guests. Our Lord is very impressed by your stoic disposition. He said, “We can't let Kanémi bury himself like this.” But Sir Tsuda... I am one who has been punished for his act of insolence against our Lord. I have reservations about serving in his vicinity. YOU need not be concerned ab0Ll\\l'1a\. Our Lord regrets his past acts. He said that he erred in applying the counsel of that woman to governmental affairs. He confided as much to me. He is not angry about what you did. In fact, it was our Lord's magnanimous instruction that you merely be placed under house arrest. EI'1deaVOI' for the sake of our Lord henceforth. If you refuse, that would be tantamount to your trampling on his thoughtfulness. Kanémi Sanzaemon.. Come forward. I, Kanemi Sanzaemon, from today shall serve at your side in the capacity of Chief Bodyguard. Endeavor to do SO. Kanémi. You may withdraw. Yes Sir. He has Come... So what's it like being Chief Bodyguard? Frankly, I'm so tense every day, I can't stand it. Sir Tsuda must really be fond of you. It had been decided that you were to be beheaded... ...but Sir Tsuda's intercession changed everything. That's what I heard. I heard if was Sir Tsuda who convinced OUT Lord as well. He'll most likely become Chief Retainer. The long era of Sir Tsuda is about to begin for the fief. And obviously, you will get promoted as well. I'm not interested in promotion. It's alright. There Will be those Who'll resent it, but don't mind them. It was you who killed Lady Renko, which was impressive. However, it's still questionable whether your deed paid off. Be that as it may, you look healthy, and that's a good thing. You too, Sir Hoshino. I manage. I've retired, but now I have to listen to the complaints of my family at our mansion. I never knew the women could be so noisy. By the way, what is it that you wanted to discuss with me? A new wife, perhaps? It's not about me. I have a niece, Rio is her name. Her original betrothal was canceled, but if you know of a man who would not mind that... Oh. I remember her well. She was politely hospitable, when I visited you during your house arrest. YES. She was very thoughtful, if I recall. ls she still at the mansion? Her younger brother got married, and has become head of the family; it's difficult for her to go back. Welcome back. Sir Hoshino will be visiting us soon. He'll be bringing a man with him. Do accommodate them. YES. Sir Maki. This is my wife's niece. Her name is Rio. Rio. This is Sir Maki Tobei, of the civil engineering department. Mitsuoka. Is Mitsuoka here? It is Kanemi. Inasmuch as Mitsuoka is not here, I shall be of service. Don't poke your mug in front of me all the time. Yes Sir. Kanemi, from now on, for small matters, speak from behind the partition. You needn't show your face every time. Understand? I don't like the way you look. The more I see it, the more angry I get. Respectfully, I have a request. Please relieve me of my post. Kanemi. Don't misunderstand. I have no qualms about your work as Chief Bodyguard. You are performing well. I won't allow a change of jobs. Just do as you're told. Mitsuoka(a here. Mitsuoka(a here. Yeah. Come in. Yeah. Come in. Yes Sir. Yeah. Come in. Kanémi. Come to my mansion later. Kanémi. Come to my mansion later. Yes sir. Yes Sir. We need to talk. Yes Sir. It must be awkward... usually having to speak from behind the partition. Don't let it bother you. Our Lord is a temperamental person. He has a bad habit of inadvertently saying what he is thinking. He regrets it afterward, though. However, as he does not want to see my face, I think being Chief Bodyguard is impractical. If there is anyone fit to take my place, I am disposed to give up the position. Is that what you were thinking I wanted to talk to you about? I wouldn't have to invite you here for a talk like that. It would Suffice to discuss if at the castle. Whether or not he wants to see your face, only you, Kanemi, can serve as Chief Bodyguard. There is a reason why this is so. I have absolutely no idea what that might be. Kanémi. I hear you are a master swordsman of the Tenshin-dokumei school. Don't bother hiding it. I've heard it from several people. Well, “master” is going too far. Never mind. I'll pour it myself. I am told there is a secret technique called “bird-spearing.“ It's said to be invincible. “Bird-spearing.“ Indeed there is. But it is not a secret technique of the school. It is a technique that I invented. I see. Now everything makes sense. That explains why you're the only one who knows the technique, and why no one has seen it. You have investigated well. Of course, I had a reason for doing so. But there is one thing that I don't understand. I'm told this “bird-spearing” strike has another name, the “sword of desperation.” What does that mean? It is to be used only when in an absolutely desperate situation. Hence the name. I think that he who uses the technique, that is, I... ...am half dead when l have to USE if. “Half dead?" Master swordsmen say strange things. Nonetheless, it is an invincible technique, correct? It appears I was right about you. I fear that there is someone who might try to kill our Lord. You would be able to thwart him. That was my thinking. Use your invincible technique in service of our Lord. Are you saying that the opponent is so skilled that I might have to use this technique? He is an expert of the Jikishin school. Sir Obiya Hayato-no-sho. I will wash your back for you. Rio... Rio... Yes? What did you think of Sir Maki Tobei? He seems to be a steady and trustworthy man. Those are qualities I appreciate. What do you think? Without talking to you first, I asked Sir Hoshina to find someone for you, even a widower. I appreciate you taking care of the house, but I don't want you to miss your chance to marry. You're very chatty tonight, uncle. Don't make fun. Listen.. You washing my back is so relaxing, that I came to rely on it without realizing it. But tonight is the last time. You need not do it any more. When matters get settled, you will be getting married. You must not be washing another man's back. I do not want to get married. I do not want to get married. Don't be foolish. You must get married to a stable husband. Otherwise, you'll never be happy. I went off to get married, but I was not happy. If by chance something were to happen to me, you'd have to return to your home. If you don't want to be under the care of your younger brother, you'll have to marry. Is my being here a bother to you? Is my being here a bother to you? I never said you're a bother. I'm just thinking of the future; I'm saying that you can't go on like this. If that's the case... Please let me stay. I want to be with you, uncle. Forever. You needn't clean up. Come to my room later. YES. It's Rio. An acquaintance of mine lives in Tsuruhané Village. Take this with you, and go there. You understand why you are to do this? I do not. Sooner or later, people will find out about us. And when that happens... No matter what they say, I am prepared. I have no regrets. Some day, a time will come when I will come and get you. When Will that be? When Will that be? l don't know. In due time, I Will come for you. Uncle.. Promise me. That you will surely come and get me. I will surely come and get you. Has Miss Rio returned yet? Has Miss Rio returned yet? No, not yet. I got a letter last month that said it would be another half-month before she returns. That's a long time. And when she does return, don't expect her to say yes. She's rather selfish. I'm going to ask Miss Rio her genuine intent. I'm going to propose to her, and if she turns me down, I'll give up then and there. Understood. Do come around and check. She should be back soon enough. By the way, Sir Kanemi, it's said there is enmity between our Lord and Sir Obiya. Is it true? Who said that? I heard it from Yoichiemon, a member of my clan. No, I have not heard this. My family is related to Sir Sasa, a retainer who is close to Sir Obiya. Therefore... Such being the case, so much the better that you not speak of it to anyone. Yes Sir. Sir Obiya is suggesting that our Lord retire. He intends to remove him by force if he refuses... ...then have his own heir, Lord Izumi-no-kami of Edo, appointed as the new Lord. I have heard that our Lord was planning to crush Sir Obiya... ...and when he became aware of this plot, sir Obiya said; “Ukyo:“ the name of the Lord. “If that is how Ukyo would have it, I have plans of my own.“ It's for the baby to wear. It's for the baby to wear. Oh... Sir Obiya, you mustn't! Sir Obiya, you mustn't! Your swords. Please do not proceed carrying your swords. Sir Obiya! Sir Obiya. Your swords. Please put aside your swords. Mitsuoka. Mitsuoka(a. Yes Sir. Prepare our Lord for a quick exit. What's going on, Kanémi? Sir Obiya is here. I'm told his state is unusual. What? It appears there is a possibility of bloodshed. If you hear a commotion, leave quickly using the rear exit. A guard will be there. So you are the swordsman of the Tenshin-dokumei school. I'm told your name is Kanémi. You're an imposing man. I have to speak to Ukyo Dayu. I cannot let you pass. I must discuss something with him. Let me pass. No. You may not. Even if it means fighting me? I will be... your opponent Please reconsider, Sir Obiya. This is madness... this fight... I shall kill anyone who gets in my way. How splendid. The “Sword of desperation: bird-spearing strike.” No, that was... Kanémi has gone mad, and has killed Sir Hayato-no-sho. Don't let him escape. Kill him. “GONE mad?" Kill him. Kill him! This is my duty! Put them away. Put away your swords! Don't do this. Please don't do this. Sir Kanémi... We can certainly make Kanemi Sanzaemon open his belly. But that's not going to bring Lady Renko back. Lord. Understand how you must feel. But keeping Kanémi alive works to our benefit... But keeping Kanemi alive works to our benefit... Denied! Sentence Kanemi to beheading. Kanemi is the greatest swordsman of our time. Nobody else can defeat Sir Obiya in a showdown. He is the only one. If things come to a head, we can use him to crush Sir Obiya. Afterward, he can be disposed of. Will you swear to me that his days are numbered? I So swear. He's not breathing. Be comforted, Lord. Now Lady Renko has been avenged, and Sir Obiya is dead. Kanémi. Our Unasaka fief has, for a hundred... Kill. Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! The sword of desperation... “Worship Festival” Wait! He didn't come today either.
