THE NEXT GENERATION PATLABOR TOKYO WAR No entering. What happened? The child brought with a letter. I'll take it. Yes sir. You guys can go now. Nagumo. Ms Nagumo. Fantastic! You break the record. I get the ponytail, you get the brunette. Huh? But... She wouldn't notice even if lightning struck her. ZAP! - Where did you guys come from? - Tokyo. I am from Tokyo too. Go and play with this lunk head. I've got a boyfriend in Tokyo. No matter. I've got a girlfriend too. What are you? We're Metropolitan Policers. No way! It's true. Ever heard of the Patrol Labor Unit? Never heard about that. Surprised that Yu doesn't know... Thanks for your hard work. Otawara. Too weak. Rubbish. Bitch! Stop! I'll pull out your XXXX! Over there. Quick! I'm a policeman! Mr. Gotoda of the Metropolitan Police, please come to our office. Sorry for interrupting. Enjoy it. Your phone line is occupied. They said you should be there. Yes. The Metropolitan Police Isamu Otawara. Right. He is under me. Although people he beat are bad guys. He is passionate to his job. I am perplexed. Things getting mess in a wink. You are police in any case. You guys think yourself are those ridiculous securities in hot spring site? Metropolitan Police, Special Vehicles Section 2. Patrol Labor Unit? You're big shots. We're like an appendix. What? Appendix? Don't you know what it is? It's useless, but all of a sudden it becomes a pain. I know that. Good. I don't care how you enjoy your trip as long as civilians aren't hurt. We have our conditions... and principles for taking an officer into custody. Exactly. You are Gotoda, right? Besides, you call this the right time for a trip? Tokyo is in such a state... You haven't the slightest clue? 2:20PM today... the bridge that links down town and waterfront... known as the Rainbow Bridge was bombed. Today's afternoon, a sudden explosion happened at Rainbow Bridge. As there was an omen, traffic regulation had been applied. No casualties in the issue. A big commotion. A terrorist attack? How should I know? Tokyo is your place, right? Yes. At least I am Tokyo Police. Won't taking bath, won't watching striptease, won't play at this moment. Is this...terrorist attack? I don't know. Captain. What? At this moment, are doing these suitable? These? You mean you fought at hot spring site brought troubles to local police? It was mission. What do you mean? I mean taking bath and play. Are these suitable? 2 hours before the explosion, there was an anonymous call, warning... the Highway Public Corporation about the bombing. Yuma...There maybe an emergency call. No, this won't happened. Prepare for unexpected cases is police's work. They should be terrorists. Such a big boom. That is, road bomb. American soldiers used in Iraq and Afghan. Parking a car with bombs here, then using the remote... Same thing seems happened in Moscow. Happened at Chechnya too. Those believed in Islam. Seldom see cases like this, destroying open area like bridge. You're right...Even the bridge exploded Most pressure from the boom will expend to the surrounding. It seems to be ignited. Or directly attack by missile Tomahawk cruise missiles Are you crazy? It's war. - What? - But, how they dropped the bomb? It might be possible by using aircraft. Launched cruise missiles from submarine. Wait, only wars will do that. Shit, I was repressed. Doing nothing whatever back. It's too serious. Not for our stage. That's why you are always like this. What? Mr Otawara, this way is not good. Hey you asshole. Addicted to the pachicom and the wife left. Shut your mouth. Asshole. Oh...He's angry. He don't want to be admonished by a man who was detained due to violence. - What? - Shut up! And you too! Go alone! Captain. Are we right to do these at this moment? Only you are doing "these". Is the rainstorm coming? As you see, central part of the Rainbow Bridge is totally destroyed. Scaring and worrying us, these are their purpose. Awesome! Smoking is prohibited here. It's been a while since the case in Niigata. What's the purpose of your visit? Before we start, I want you to see something. What's that? I'm sure it'll excite you. Mr. Shiobara. Connect this. Ok. The monitor seems to be connected to game by izumino. What to do? Izumino, come here. Ah... I don't know. You...Call Mr Osakeya. Connect to other drives. And gables are not enough. It's serious. You made this. Ready. Here's narrow. Put over there. There's dangerous. Excuse me. Connecting to other unknown media, the feel is not good. Although all guys here are police, may I ask others to leave the room? Isn't bad. Watching together seems more fun. I knew it. A video production company shot this at the time of the crime. A footage I got from them. Budget of the shot should be high. Isn't it an idol MV? Helicopter can't do that. Boom Now, for the next footage. The margins between the frames are filtered Under this called finished file. No misrepresentation appeared, full edition process is tapped. True, but they can edit it whenever they want. Obviously it is a compress file. To abstract the changeable information. What's that? - That's a... - A missile. It can't be a Maverick, so from the position of the fin... AGM-114 Hellfire. Frequently used in the Gulf War of '91 and the Iraq War of 2003. Very reliable. The one that failed to assassinate Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan. You are really soldier otaku. It's common sense. Common sense of soldier otaku. What would the weapon transporter be? Japan and US combat helicopters, or the Maritime Self-Defense Force's patrol helicopters. Or an unmanned aircraft as the Predator, but considering the environment... There it is. A combat helicopter. AH-88 "Hellhound". The Ground Self-Defense Force is equipped with the improved version, AH-88J. It can carry 20 mm auto cannons and 8 rounds of "Hellfire". This isn't the whole silhouette. An abstract of the sea movement... Like a mask? Rather like the data itself. What's that? You lost me. I heard the Defense Force is testing the improved version of "Hellhound". It's equipped with a thermo-optic camouflage system. Thermo-optic, huh? Not a radar stealth, but an "invisible stealth helicopter". Is that for real? I think it's the modified version of AH-88J2... Gray Ghost. Well done. I'm impressed. Hey, careful! Mr Gotoda. You have excellent subordinates, but now, it's time for adults only. 3 days before the bombing... a combat helicopter disappeared from the skies of the Defense Force in Gotemba. Or should I say, hijacked. Hijacked? They were testing their new helicopter. The "invisible" one that boy mentioned. The one we saw on the footage? That emerging object? They're keeping it discreet. But there'll be a commotion all over Japan when "the ghost" appears. How ironic. A military secret disappeared in thin air. I'm afraid the intelligence members and the secret service are now out of ideas. What an elegant hobby. It takes a lot of trouble. They need feeding and changing water regularly. 6 troublesome fish. That "ghost" appeared in broad daylight. What could their purpose be? Scheming a war against their own country with a single combat helicopter? The Public Security have been investigating a certain group. It can't be... The sympathizers of Yukihito Tsuge. Presently in jail for leading the "unrealized coup d'etat" 13 years ago. He has his followers now. Please don't smoke. You visited Tsuge. What did you talk about? Visitors of specified prisoners are looked up. Didn't you know? I only asked him if he still believed in his version of justice. And? He said "I'm still stuck in jail because I do." Sounds like him. Have you ever met him? I'm thirsty. Shall I send for tea? No hidden bottles in your drawer? Just like in the movies. Sorry, but I don't drink or smoke. Unlike your predecessor? What do you want me to do? The tradition of the SV2 is to act beyond the law. Unlike Mr. Goto, I'm a decent public servant. Stealing and fleeing with a helicopter is one thing. But transporting and hiding it under strict surveillance is another. They also need to feed "the ghost" with fuel and ammunition. They have a commissariat. At the time of the disappearance, Gray Ghost carried practice ammunition. However, the missile used was real. This proves there is a regular commissariat. Which means another mission is possible. We must stop them before that happens. You will cooperate? If I see this, there's no turning back, right? What does justice mean to Tsuge? Something that supports the foundation of ideas and political principles... "morals". Our country abandoned that half a century ago. First Lieutenant Haibara, age 30. Pilot of the hijacked "Gray Ghost". The first from the Women's Army Corps to be a licensed pilot. Though a skillful pilot, she had problems with her disposition. She was reprimanded repeatedly by her superiors for disobeying orders. Why would such a woman be allowed on a cutting-edge helicopter? She was known as a brilliant pilot among the Fuji School Brigade. One thing's bothering me. The combat helicopter is a two-seater. If it was stolen during a drill, why isn't Haibara's buddy mentioned at all? He was found dead in the forest of Mr. Fuji... with one shot to the head. The photograph left in her locker is the only thing Haibara left behind. I tried processing it, but couldn't make out what the stone monument was. Two sausages per person. An egg per person. Fried noodles and roasted pig. Smell bad? No, delicious. So shocking. Last night's footage? A high-speed helicopter with a thermo-optic camouflage system. But it shows on radar? Yeah, 'cause the original model is that bizarre AH-88. But that's not the problem. Why not? If they are to assume a delay defense combat on undulating land... they chose the antiaircraft artillery's low visibility over electronic concealment. Who's "they"? The higher-ups who developed it. Who are they? How should I know? But there's the stealth fighter. They're undetected electronically, but still visible. Have you been listening at all? The Americans wouldn't sell them to us anyway. This helicopter is a creation of our exclusively defensive security policy. The product of our pacifist constitution is now a threat. How ironic. How does it work? By operating the liquid-crystal display installed on the surface of the aircraft... Shut up! I'm tired of your military geek crap. What's the matter? Visible or invisible, it shows on radar. Next time we'll chase it with a fighter and launch a missile at it. Are you crazy? How can we? Even if it is or isn't loaded with bombs... What would happen if it crashed in the city? Moron! They hijacked it knowing that. Simply flying over Tokyo is a threat. Same thing as taking million citizens as hostages. That's what makes them a terrorist. An asymmetric war. A coward's war. Well...None of our business. What's in you hand, Shiobara? Oolong tea, sparking one. Oh my god! Let me drink. - No. - Oh...Captain's coming. Wasn't he back to the Metropolitan Police? He usually having meal in canteen before going. So far this time. Power of distributing meals. What?! No more frankfurters? None. Your people eat too much. My favorite. Out with it. Who ate my frankfurters?! Inspector. The neighbors heard the noise of the helicopter. An ideal place for a field supply depot. They flew in from Gotemba and carried the container out from the mountains. Where to? Those involved in the development of the helicopter left their jobs for another. An airline company in Tokyo. It went bankrupt and the whereabouts of the owner and staff remains unknown. A crime thoroughly prepared. How did you find out? I checked out the bank account of Haibara's buddy. A large sum of money was deposited from that company. So Haibara's buddy asked for more money and was silenced in the end. Before they went bankrupt, they purchased something big through a dummy company. There'd be no turning back, huh? Fine property. The geographical features and the size of the building is perfect for a hideout. Why do you want to team up with us? Public Security should be up for the task. Foreign Affairs can only pursue the case from the lines of involvement overseas. It's also my duty to report to my superiors. You're making us take the risk to prove your theory. The Military Police and the Ground Staff Office are after the helicopter. But as for this case... The police must solve it on our own. Through regular procedure then. Why don't we apply for searching through the main office? Security police cooperation system? It's impossible to start a war. Deserved to be called security. The worship is so cool. This is speedboat for emergency. Tokyo is a place with large area of river basin. There's no blockage and signal on water. It's hard to catch up even for police's patrol boat. What's this? Go and ask that soldier otaku. Such a surreal sight. It looks like a scene from wartime. Don't you think? Losing a war isn't just losing lives and land. No matter how many years go by... there are certain things that time will never heal or revive. Like "justice". Or "morals" Tsuge talked about? Call it what you will. Justice is lost and it will be disregarded. They've avoided to carry the load of justice and accepted this situation... by playing the role of the defeated. Tell me. Who do you mean by "they"? The people you and I should protect. The people of this city. They've taken advantage of being the "victim"... I and with their irresponsible screams that demand apology and compensation... the word "justice" has lost its shocking solemness forever. 50 years of deception and decay. Tsuge wouldn't allow that. But Creating another war to recover the justice lost in the previous war... is just twisting things even more. That's why our former Captains fought to protect the peace of injustice. And they've all disappeared. I wonder why? Dating. Isn't strange to go out so often in this moment? Captain is also male. Ministry of the Public Security is beautiful. Shut your mouth and go to work. I'll look at your fine property, so let me see the other one. Haibara's face? I'd like to see her, too. There's no picture. What do you mean? Somehow, it's disappeared from all our files. It was deleted from our server before the incident, or... She may have never existed. The one makes people bleeding. People may also make she bleeds. If there's no punishment for unfairness, that will be so unbalanced. Finally peace will be destroyed. Although trigger a war, there's no influences toward the Goddess of Justice who holds the scale on her hand. This rigorous is the essence of justice. It's been a while. Sorry for making you come all this way. When did you come back to Japan? The truth is I did not return. Even here's Japan, here's the place the kingdom can't invade. I asked a military officer at the refugee camp to take me on the transport plane. No entering or leaving the country. You could say that Shinobu Nagumo is officially still abroad. But why now? Why won't Mr. Goto show up in the first place? He said you wouldn't listen to him But I would submissively listen to you? Listen to you? Is that so? Would you? So, are you going to tell me what "the legacy" is? The unrealized war schemed by Yukihito Tsuge 13 years ago. The Special Vehicles Section 2 could not be in different to it. Last night, someone among of us left her post during a stand-by alert... and met with the alleged mastermind of this case in Tokyo. And disgracefully failed to capture our target. Inspector Nagumo. Fill in the details for us. Kaiho Senior Commissioner, Head of the Security Bureau... used this to build a sense of unity among his incompetent men. Politically staged so he could reestablish his initiative. I tried to arrest Tsuge on my own but failed. So I became the perfect scapegoat. Inspector Nagumo. You are relieved from Head of SV2, and Captain of Division 1. We take you into custody. Don't touch me! You should know the rest. Mr. Goto and the extra-legal action of Division 2 solved the case. As for Yukihito Tsuge... You captured him. But the two of you never came back to your former posts... and disappeared within days. Why was that? Things we're doing can't be published. Also, Mr Goto and I knew how the Metropolitan Police playing chaos and incompetence. We were living witnesses. Mistake of the Police Office saved the endangered SV2. But after a decade, forgetting these should have taken some time. Between previous captains and Head of the Metropolitan Police, there's implicit recognition, isn't it? Implicit recognition? Head of the Metropolitan Police, they can't order SV2 through regular procedure. There's reason. Mr Goto was missing and you left. Both of you were not here, so as to protect those agreements. If you think like this, then those Head of the Metropolitan Police, will think like this as well. The truth is always simple. After the case resolved, there was a personnel reshuffle. The Superintendent General resigned. The upper echelons of the Security Bureau were mostly discharged or fired. In the world of bureaucracy, one may lose a post for vested rights. But one will never reveal a blunder to the next generation. Mr. Goto was well aware of this. SV at that time, didn't look like an organization. No...Not only this, Two captain escaped from detention and was wanted. Part of the members were not a legitimate police. Team 2 of SV2 at that time, was just group of armed civies. Goto left. Not only broke the rules, accumulated weapons, broke the law, invaded buildings, did numerous illegal behaviors, no need to take any responsibilities after that. It was chaos at that time. Masterminds of such an organization, Mr Goto and I left. People who knew these were all imagined that the Metropolitan Police and SV2 had incredible tradings. It's true that Mr Goto has high potential on seeking out plans. Maybe should call him fraud division. When I agreed to Mr. Goto to leave the country... I thought this was the time bomb set by the invisible hands of God. No one knows of its existence. So it cannot be touched. Pandora's box can only be opened by those prepared to take the risk. So the legacy of the SV2... The time bomb set by our predecessor never existed? Unbelievable. Such a deception. This is the best souvenir Mr. Goto and I can give you. But Mr. Gotoda... How you use this legacy of ours is up to you. What will you protect? For what reason? What will I protect... Shige-san. A messenger came from the Metropolitan Police. We can't operate the Labor until there's further notice. Where in the heck have you been all this time? The Metropolitan Police are coming to crush us SV for good. Now? Especially now. When that "ghost" appears again, they'd have to prepare for the worst. I wouldn't be surprised if they started taking things into their own hands. Shige-san can we mobilize it? What're you planning on doing? Stop right there. If you follow your predecessor, you'll never see the light of day. What about the good old tradition of the SV2? Time changes and people change with it. But if you find something you can't allow to change... come back and ask me again. All here? Team just went off duty. Call them back. Call up the whole Division. Yes, Captain! Captain, isn't this investigation illegal? Don't you think we should leave it to Public Security? They're standing-by, but they need a certain situation to make a raid. Why do we have to be the ones to create it? You could always back out. I'm in. I'll do it, okay? Not a rat from the investigation department or the military police. That uniform is the one from the Metropolitan Police, the SV2. The Labor Units? But why them? Haibara! She's bored. Let her fool around. But... She lacks patriotism and ambition but still, we need her. Are you sure about this, Captain? We're not trained to make a raid without a Labor. You could always back out. I'm not... I'm not forcing you. Right, Captain? That's what our former Captain used to say. No one has to force me. How many of them are there? They're armed, right? They're the kind with missiles. Scared? I'm going in alone. But we have support. Vice Chief, ready? Any time! Wait for our signal. Roger! Vice Chief, are you sure about this? If our Chief finds out, and something happens to it... Leave it to me! I don't mean this. Even if we... if there is a fault, before Chief, Kamihara will be killed. Don't be silly, go and prepare missiles. Great! I go inside. How is inside? You will know it. Wait a minute before support of maintenance class start, (Russian) Yes, Sir. Otagawa and Osakeya alert at the back. Akira izumino at the side. Yes sir. How's Yuma? Maybe killed. Ow...Ouch! Damn you! Hey, ow, ow... That does it. There she is. Right. Fire away. Right-oh. Energy input, 120% Shut up! Fire! Fire! It's a hit. Fire for effect. Roger! Fire for effect! Going in! Enemy raid! Attackers from 10 o'clock. Yes. Shoot, you coward! I have a wife and child... You mean "ex-wife". Fight like a man! Guard the perimeter and get ready for liftoff! Rotate! Concentrate to the helicopter! Don't let it go! Hey, there might be road. Hand this to me. I can drag out some time. A dead end. Maintenance, where's back-up? We don't know your position. It's too risky. Alter 20 notches to the right! Kasya! 10 notches to the right! 10 more to the right! We're out of shells. What?! Mr. Kambara made this only as a hobby. Then we'll have to fire common shells! Fire! What was that? Like a shit. It's no good. What shall we do, Captain? Retreat and try not to die. Help is on the way. What do you mean by "help"? I knew they were watching. We're changing players. Get out of the way. Roger, we'll retreat! Captain, what do you mean "retreat"? Shut up and retreat. To the Labor crew of the SV2. Leave the rest to us and retreat. Start the engine! Run for your lives! Police vehicles ahead. They're blocking the way. Haibara. Don't waste any ground rockets and use the auto cannon. Roger, I'll get rid of them. Our blockade must be gone by now. Hey, you're alive. Captain. I hate you. There's damage everywhere and our enemy escaped. I thought we could leave the combat to Public Security and arrest them ourselves. What's this? It's nothing. Playing on duty? Though I'm in no position to criticize. Where could they have gone? We haven't a clue. They've probably housed the helicopter in a container near the city. For instance, somewhere around. This coast of the bay But there are hundreds and thousands of containers just in the vicinity. Out of ideas. Don't know whether this's useful. A report related to Haibara. Thank you, Auntie. Thank you. So, the SV2 is going to be disbanded? Are you letting of the good old tradition the SV2 come to an end? Thanks to our predecessor we were able to continue this far. When the higher-ups needed their positions the legacy must have mattered. But now, it wouldn't be valid. Lieutenant Gotoda. I think you've got that wrong. A tradition can only be inherited by creating a new one. I believe in that. The lady on the other side of the fence would have said so. Akira, stop that noise! Hey, can't you hear me? Pass of Haibara. That's nothing mystery. Father is local government officer. Completely normal family. No conduct problem and no need for counseling. Graduated from local public high school with good performances. Join the team spontaneously. Student of FEC. Gained disqualification after that. Since she was in the team, her potential was high rated. Being assigned to teaching in a new Air Force. At the time being, serious personality problems appeared. Pass of Haibara seems nothing suspicious. If something must be pointed, that should be too normal, so is hard to understand. Someone who know her such as her former classmates and form teacher, they have the same comment on Haibara, she was not impressed. They should meet her in the same classroom. Memories related to Haibara, were all uncertain. Whatever she said or did. Apart from her name, she was not impressed toward people surround her. But one thing, everyone had remembered, the only memory related to Haibara. She laughed, all the time. Haibara, it's time to go. Gong to "Ghost". It's time. Start your thing. Roger that. Right away. It really came. Just as Mr. Gotoda suspected. Shige-san, don't worry. It's just a few prefabs. Shut up! You'd never understand how I feel! Our late Chief's tradition of the SV. It's reduced to ashes! Poor Mr Shigeo. Those traditions has been kept for 20 years. Don't cry. I'll revenge. Sounds nice. Enemy is on top, how could you revenge? This... I guess captain should have think about it. Pass it to him. Do you want to do? It's certainly uneasy. Moscow does not believe in tears. I'll go alone if I have to. Get ready! Let's go! Our Captain's mind is set. Now is our chance to use our Labors! Osakeya, engine on. Go, Otagawa. I can't do this in my own. Here we go! One, two... We have the principal members gathered here on an emergency call. To discuss as members of the Security Bureau... how we must carry out our duties under these circumstances. Due to the importance of the matter our Superintendent General is with us. But before we start... Last night, someone among US... left his post during an emergency stand-by. Lieutenant Gotoda. You acted without consultation. Under this tense situation... your actions disturbed the order within the police. Your behavior is a disgrace! It's disrupting the internal order of the Metropolitan Police. Excuse me. This is the Shanghai Restaurant. The SV2 building is damaged and in flames. What are your plans now, Inspector? The Gray Ghost can't keep on flying forever. Gotoda! How dare you! Shinobu-san. As Mr. Goto suspected, the storm has come. Gotoda.You can't be speaking to... Could it be... Mr. Gotoda. Our SV2 building is destroyed. But you still have measures to fight? Yes, we have. Then will you show it to me? The good old tradition of the SV2? The cursed tradition is more like it. You and Mr. Goto are cruel people. I'm sorry. You're both very cruel. Would you do me a favor? Very well. I'll tell them. Gotoda! You've contacted that woman! What's your scam? Where is that woman? Answer now! I have a message to you all from the former Captain of the SV2. A message? That woman... what does Shinobu Nagumo have to say to us? Don't touch me. I'm sick and tired of you people. I will follow my predecessor. Gotoda, I've always thought you were smarter than this. I'm afraid I'm just an appendix. Detain him! We'll take this to the disciplinary committee! Transfiguration. Pedestrians passing through should avoid government office areas... and take shelter in safe buildings. The show interrupted at any time. All TV stations will broadcast an emergency live. Don't turn off, call on people around, let them know about this as soon as possible. This morning, police facilities indifferent places has been an explosion at a high-rise building, with... many casualties. Pedestrians passing through the Metropolitan area... should take shelter in safe buildings. Haibara. Teach them what war means. Fire! Supply Complete! Go! This is Briest, target detected. Request permission to attack. Briest called. Again, request permission to attack. Briest, Cannon license. Over, great difference on speed, lock failed. Briest, E2C takes off. Wait until the next mission. Yes sir. I have so many questions. Whether you have more supply units, where the next target is. How you're planning to recover the helicopter. I'll shoot two more. Hound to "Takama". We will commence attack on Gray Ghost. Takama to "Hound". Permission granted. Ghost to "Hound". This aircraft is invincible. Retreat. You're a disgrace to the unit. Give it up, Haibara! The Shanghai Restaurant. What is that anyway? It seems to be a secret password for emergencies. Another tradition of the SV. One of the men confessed. This was their last supply. They were to destroy the helicopter after the mission and turn themselves in. Submission? Let's say they did this in the name of their justice. Except for the one flying around now. They don't like her. We let them have their way. They've won. We couldn't stop them. It may be so to you, but not to us. It's our job to make them pay for what they've done. Finally tend to work out your justice? Inspector Takahata. What? Who's their backing? It is not so much a backing, it's a country. Certainly it is. Pin down its head and make it circle. Roger. It vanished...Target's gone! Don't let that distract you. Keep looking. It's behind me, I'm done! Shake it off! Takama, "Hound" is down. Crashed at Shinjuku Central Park. Request for rescue. Takama to "Hound". It's too dangerous. Go back to base. Damn it! By now, what's their purpose? Why did they attack only our place since the beginning? Obviously they can go, but the reason they fight with the helicopter. Also, last time you was beaten, that woman looked so happy. So you know what is... their final target, right? You mean us? They will first attack places where SV is which is revenge to us who provoked them. When she sees our Labors safe and sound on the express way... she's bound to come. No matter what her group thinks, this is Haibara's war. Head for our landing spot. We can limit the damage there. Will she really come? Ask Akira sitting next to you. Captain, are you sure about this? Won't we get punished or anything? As our predecessors, I won't force you. It's up to you to decide. Maybe we're picking the wrong fight. They may even settle things for us. What about you, Captain? I blustered out before Head of Security, and we'll be disbanded anyway. No kidding? It's a miracle we lasted this long. You can always back out. You could become a riot police and sweat with the others every day. Doesn't sound appealing. Or you could quit the police and start over. Stop blabbering! Do something! Shut up! You useless taxpayers! You, too. What'll it be? Are you in or out? Ohtawara, get in. Right! My wife's gone. I'll make a living out of pachinko. What about you guys? They're keen enough. But can they manage on their own? I don't think so. I'll doubt even two Labors would. I'm in. I won't let her beat me. Shiobara, how about you? I won't let her beat me. I won't sweat with the riot police. Hiro. I'm following my predecessor after all. The Shanghai Restaurant. It's me. The photograph... The one in the file I sent you the other day. Remember? I deduced the tower in the background from the database and specified the place. I sent my men there to confirm it. Guess where it was? The cemetery where Haibara lies. The Haibara's? Rei Haibara's grave. Died at 13. Due to a disease. REI HAIBARA Then who's flying up there in the skies of Tokyo now? Who is it? Briest called upon Headquarters. Reached the designated airspace, please give instruction. Labor is conducting follow the support team. Don't let the target rise. Yes sir. Don't move it vigorously. All I can guarantee is 3 minutes of maneuver. Akira, let's start! Roger. Deck-up! Cockpit main monitor link complete. Starting up LOS, OS control green. All green. Power drive system up. MAA up. Inner system up. FCNM up. Here we go. It's coming! Ohtawara, fire now! It fell. I'll make you drink plenty of water, too. She used Labor No. 2 as decoy and read its course. It's coming again. Akira, it's up to you! It disappeared! Listen for its engine sound. Akira, the rear left! Kasya's shot damaged a part of the right side of the armor. So she'll only show you the left side. Are you listening? She'll either come from the rear left or the front right! I know she'll come head-on in the end. Head-on? I'm not sure... but I think so. Here it comes! I told you I could only guarantee 3 minutes! Damn it! Didn't it haven external starting system? It does, but... Hiromichi, get in quick! Akira, are you alive? What's that supposed to mean? We'll start up the Labor externally. The system is for emergency escape, so you only have seconds to finish her off. The next time she comes close, I'll start up the system, okay? Roger. Let's trust Akira and wait her to come head-on! Roger. Now! You can do it, Akira! Go! Yes... Great! - Akira! - Yuma! You did it! Good girl! We did it! You did it! So did you, Inspector. Outstanding shooting skills. Your extra-legal activity... or rather, the good old tradition of the SV2. You've shown that to me. I was supposed to be a decent public servant. Me, too. We've been through a lot, but I enjoyed working with you. Say hello to your lady predecessor.
