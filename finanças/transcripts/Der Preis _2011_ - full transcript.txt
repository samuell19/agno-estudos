Hello? Do you need help? THE PRIZE fgfgfg Mr Beck? Shall we send the cleaner in later? Yes, I've arrived. I'll give the site manager a kick up the ass and leave, like I said. Hey! Come on, kid! Is this the WK Nord site? Are you the site manager? Alexander Beck. Rettinger & Partner, Frankfurt am Main. We had an appointment. - Manfred Lange. Am I too late? - Here? No. Congratulations on the prize and on winning the contract. Doesrt happen often. Is that the block we'll start with? According to my plans... - It's that one. The one with all the pretty curtains. Doesrt it bother you that it's still occupied? Put it this way: I could use some backup. How long has this block been empty? - Two months. It should've been torn down ages ago. Excuse me. Lange here. Yes, I've been waiting the whole time. Excuse me? Oh... I'm sorry. Good night. - You werert bothering me. Alex! Jeanette? When I saw your name on the room list I thought it might be you. Our lost Alex. What do you mean, "lost"? Or disappeared. - Or just "moved away"? I know, but... Should I have checked out here? So what are you up to here? Nothing. It's just a short stay. I'll be off soon. In that car out there? Or without a car. By the way, Udo is at the garage sometimes. He works there now and then. Just so you know... Thank you. - Okay. Bye. Except you and Udo, have any... I mean... Have any of the others stayed around here? Some of them left, then came back. Not many, though. I have to go. See you around. The concept: To mediterraneanize life. In our project, this means bright rooms connected to the outside via open balconies, glass panels, opening the lower floors to extra outer spaces, so called "green rooms" with a garden city feel. We will increase the quality and social value of your apartment block. It will no longer be recognizable as a block. What I mean is... The aesthetic change will create a new spirit of living. What about the balconies? Can you see through them? What will I do with all my stuff? The balconies will be partly open. How high will the rent be? The rent is determined by the RWG, the property owner. Dear friends, this whole thing is solely about your interests. I've heard a lot about your ambitions and your remarkable talent. And I know every detail about your prize-winning project... I don't have any special ambitions here, I'm just working for my office. That's good. - Secondly, why is the block we're meant to start with still occupied? According to our calculations, your renovation plan requires a sum per square metre that we, as the owner's collective, cannot afford. But since the renovations must be done, and many local firms are ready to start... Firms that you are strangling because you don't clear the buildings and thus delay and obstruct the project! Anyway, I took the liberty of asking a local office to suggest a few changes. A pity, it wasrt a good start for you. I wouldn't mind if it ended quickly. Two more. Why do a project like this if people would be happy with less? I mean, it's great to do more than a bit of insulation... But it's understandable... - What? That people prefer to live in a ghetto because it's cheaper and familiar? Why not? - GDR tower blocks were the bare minimum. Food, sleep, and a roof. A typology like that forms your mind. - I was always told people wanted to live there. They wanted warm water, heating... And the property owner does want to renovate a little bit. Yeah, a little bit. You're not from here and yet you're defending the old GDR barracks? I'm not defending anything. It's all so long ago. Why? I'm married. She's from here. Lange? Yes? - Um... I've brought your husband. Can you open the door? Who's there? - Nobody. He moved out ages ago. You okay? Can I have a beer? I wasrt thinking straight. No problem. Had you told me the address in your ID isn't up to date it would've saved me some carrying. You went and... I hope you don't mind my sleeping here sometimes. Shit, it's freezing here. Believe it or not, I lived in the block we're renovating. Half my class lived here. - Ah, that explains your eagerness. Micha lived in the block opposite. My friend Micha, who I'd known from kindergarten. Shit! Look at that! Incredible! Wait till you see this, then! What's that? - Don't touch it, you'll mess it up. Come on, hurry! Come on! Look at it! You may as well throw it away. It's cool like that. I want it. Okay, take it out. Let me guess... My sister. Get your feet down! Shit, it's our mum! A homecomer. Homecomer... It feels like a foreign country. I could just as well be working in Mozambique or Ulan Bator. What became of those two? Nicole wrote to me once, but I never replied. And her brother? This is Ulrich Muther's building, the Ahornblatt, which he designed and built in 1973-75 at Berlirs "Fischerinsel". He used a double-curved shell structure, which... is called a "hyperbolic paraboloid". Shut up, Wocke! This is the rescue centre in Binz... - Very good, Alexander, but to what extent are such buildings a necessity in our Socialist society? They help break the monotony of residential areas. They raise people's spirits so they work more efficiently. Well, the GDR got 10,000 VW Golfs for Muther's building in Wolfsburg. Isn't a VW a Socialist necessity? Michael! I'm warning you! Don't forget the FDJ elections, okay? - Yes, Jeanette! I'II hide it in here so I'll know where it is if I need it. Why do you play secretary for them? - "Them"? Arert we in the same class? Oh, I dunno. Great, isn't it? Do you want one too? Shall we go the Baltic Sea next summer to see Muther's UFO? If you get time off from sports school. How do you know they'll accept me? - Of course they will! Where did you read the thing about the Volkswagens? In an old Stern magazine I found at Wocke's. It somehow ended up there. His father would never read it. Since when do you go to Wocke's? - I just went there, that's all. I've gotta go too. Here, listen to this. It's cool. And strictly prohibited. We'll go and views the flats now. But it's... It's that fat Stasi pig's problem if he didn't clear the block. We're going in to make a start. I don't want to stay here forever. The sooner the better. Yes. Hi. - Hi. Excuse me, do you have more of those vans? - No, just that one. Here. But several people that drive it. I saw somebody driving it a couple of days ago. A blonde woman in an anorak. I know her. This street will go, by the way. We'll put gardens here, then people can grow their own vegetables. Would you like that? - We'II see... Shall I give the anorak a message from you? No, thanks. We've lived here for over 25 years, directly opposite one another. We're not moving out. You'II have to carry us out in a box. You can stay here while we renovate. We just want to see your flat. We'll take photos to document the alterations. Is that okay for you? Okay, we'll tear this wall down, and also the slabs that'll separate the outside... I'II carry on, then. Yes? - I'm here about the renovation. I'm the architect. Were you informed? No, I didn't know a thing. Hey, am I seeing things? - Hartmann? I can't believe it! Is this... - Yes, my old mars flat. Come on in! Come on! So you're responsible for all this building stuff? I don't care. I'II get thrown out soon anyway. Havert paid the rent in two years! Okay, guys. Time to go. Hartmann! - Bye-bye! Off you go! I want to talk to my guest. Say, can't you sort me something out? Work-wise, I mean. On the site, something like that? I don't know. I'm more in charge of the concept. I'II see what can be done. It can't be so difficult. What about your workshop? Which workshop? Ah... How do you know about that? You seem to be enjoying your time here. I was at Udo's place. And? And nothing. Okay, then. Have you seen Nicole, by the way? Her dad has a fitness studio nearby. And she works at the school. Our school. She's Tina's teacher. I thought... Good night. The shifts are from 2 pm to 10 pm, from 10 pm to 6 am, and then again from 6 am to 2 pm. Now we'll take a look in here. So, here you can see where our workers get changed before and after work. As I said, we work a three-shift system around the clock in order to cover the additional production of consumer goods. Not bad. You could look like that in the future too. We take on many apprentices here. Thanks to Mr Walter, from our mentor brigade, we gained an insight into daily life in socialist production and... we want to thank you for the interesting afternoon. With the FDJ greeting: Friendship! - Friendship! Friendship! Well, then... - Jeanette! Thank you. - Thank you very much. We've prepared a little something for you. Hey, Alex! Friendship? Are you crazy? - Shall we take off? Or do you want to stay here? We can't just go now, Micha! Where is Michael? You should use your talents, not play the clown. You won't get into the sports school this way. And what if I don't want to? - Stop it! Why are we here? The others were involved too! - Udo! You're representing the whole class. And I want to know what happened at the factory, in the canteen. Alexander? Well, it dragged on quite long, and everyone was hungry... I wasrt. - You can talk! You'II stay here until it's cleared up. What's wrong with you? Don't you have any respect anymore? We'll say sorry to the mentor brigade. Why didn't you wait for me? Do you want this? Is it yours? 10:17, Micha! Great time, Micha! - Don't talk to me. He's just nervous about the sports school. Why? He won every competition so far. He'll make it. Shit! I have to go shopping! Hey! - Hello there! I need to go in! Please! - She'll get in trouble at home! Stupid cow, it's not even your shop! Mum! Thank you! At Berlirs Maxlm Gorki theatre, an event took place today celebrating the anniversary of the Friends of the Soviet Union Assoclation, whlch was founded on November 4, 1928. I'm going back to work. Enjoy your dinner. - Bye. Good morning. - Morning. It seems your colleague didn't hear his alarm clock. If you're here about your supposedly cheaper version of the renovation... I'm only here to do the... What did you call it? The "prize-winning" project. And if my office withdraws, you'll lose a lot of the financing since they're tied to the competition. You maybe forgot that. Maybe you forgot that this is private property. Private company property. Not state-owned property, which you probably 'looked after' too? If you want to believe that... You're judging me? You're free to do so. But I'm sure I understand the people here better than you do. So what now? - As long as we don't release the property it's illegal for you to start work. You and your Frankfurt office should know that. Oh, Lange! You know that we're stuck here, don't you? Have you found out if anything stinks here? Hi. Do you live around here? Are you at all interested in the renovations? A bit. I dunno. I see. Are you looking for someone? No. - Then what are you doing here? How did you get in here, anyway? Through the door. What's up, Sarah? Is there a problem? Shall we use first names? I mean, what a coincidence that we ran into one another. I don't know. Well... So why did you come to the school? No reason. Maybe because I was bored? Okay. Well... I have to go inside again. Wait! What? Okay, take care, Alex. Sorry. Just dozed off. This morning I was... - It's fine. I have an appointment at court. Not for work. Family? You were right about young love. No point clinging to the past. Did I say that? See the building work through. It's not my fault that it's not getting done. - Not only that. Perseverance sometimes pays off. Is that her? "10th December 1988. Daily routine. Path plastered, concrete houses. I eat and I don't know why it's necessary. I talk and I know I don't need to because I don't need to know. Everything is regulated here. Why ask questions? It's just the way it is... It's the right way. Stay quiet, be happy at last." Youth sports school. You just need to sign it. - I need to? I don't need to do anything. - Dad, please! It has nothing to do with you. - You say that all the time. The sport... It could all disappear so quickly. You've said that before, too. Another coincidence? - I don't think so. How do you know that it's the end for me? I asked in the office and... - Alex... I didn't have the phone number. - Anyway, I... So, life just went on without me? Of course. What have you got planned? I thought you lived on the organic farm. We wanted to leave somehow. Nicole has had enough and I'd like to see something new. There's lots to do here, but it will come about. Do you mind if I go and talk to her? - Go ahead. I could do a nice family house project for you here. Maybe. But aren't you quite busy? You know what I realized? We were friends for much less time than the years that have passed since. I thought we were more than friends. We were kids, werert we? I'm sorry. Let's start again, okay? How are you? Do you have a family? No, I don't. How about making a coffee? Coffee? No, I think I'll be off. I'II go for a walk. But thanks, to him too. I... I'd really like... I mean... Maybe it's asking too much, but... Can you imagine taking a day out with me? Just a day. Then I'll leave again, if you want. You can think it over. What do you say? - Where did you get that? It gets around. Why has the Sputnik been banned? The magazine is Russian, after all. You must have an opinion about that! At work, you have to talk, as well! You're a Party member. You have to say something about it! I have never said anything about your friendship with Micha. What's he got to do with it? I didn't get it from him. He thinks that the Wahls are not the right people for you. Don't drive so fast. It's from Micha. Today's youth culture. You're really up to date. I won't let my friends be banned from anything! Hey Alex! - What's up, Wocke? Do you want to come up? I'm going to read the Bravo. - Fine. Hello, Dad. Was "Colt Seavert" on TV? - Yes, but it's "Colt Seavers". At home, we don't watch any western programmes. - They are not political. Give it to me! I had the fox first! Get out! - It's mine! Where do get something like that? - I bought it from someone. I always get bottles and paper. I put rocks in the bundles. That makes them heavier. And would you swap it? Do you mean David Bowie? What do you want for it? - I don't know. It was expensive. Maybe that. They are really white! All East Germans wanting to travel, who stopped at the Permament Mission In East Berlin, have left the building again. In all, 10 citizens wishing to travel sought asylum, so they would arrive more quickly In West Germany. A short tlme after Vogel's arrival... Alexander, what are you doing? You can't take it all literally. Both phases have in common the social ownership of production means. The exploitation of mankind by mankind is eradicated, society and the economy are guided in a planned manner. Mankind and his needs are the main consideration. The development of his talents... Jeanette, is Wocke really in the West? Or did they arrest the whole family? I dunno. - Jeanette. Read on. Michael? I forgot my book. Can we discuss something more recent? What would you like to discuss? Wocke's journey to freedom, maybe? What's all this about? What does "freedom" mean? Engels says... - Freedom is the recognition of necessity, and nothing will change that in this country. Good evening. Can I help? That's Herr Wahl's sport studio, right? Yes, my husband's down there. Husband? - Yes. Wolfgang, someone wants to see you. Hello. Can I do anything for you? Body-building, kinetics? Thick jacket? - I could fetch it. Is he letting you drive? The question is whether I want to. A croissant for your wife? That was nice. A bit late, maybe. I visited your dad, by the way. In his studio. I see. What for? I haven't seen him in years. Why didn't he want Micha to go to Sports College? He was an athlete himself. Even a trainer. Did you come looking for the guilty party? - No, I... Micha's diary doesn't mention it. His diary? - You wanted me to read it. When we were still small, Dad and a friend from his team were on a sports trip in the West... They wanted to stay there. It went wrong. Only the friend made it. Our dad was nominated for the Olympics. But after two years in prison it was obvious he'd never again be allowed to compete. Micha and I were no longer friends when he died. I know. What you don't know is that I was one of those... I was one of those who betrayed him. Beck, have you forgotten me? Can you say something? Are you stupid? Bad mood or something? Udo, are you that naive? Who do you think I am? What am I supposed to save? - Who do you think you are? That's the question! You've become a lousy little arsehole, haven't you? You come back after all this time, it doesn't suit you, you go again... We don't suit you? Piss off, then! What are you up to? Netti, he's talking crap! Fine. Oh, you? You're still around? Your car is where it always is. I'd like to stay in the container. The last night here. The last night! They tried to reach you. There's a new chairman here now. The suspicions of your company helped a lot. The new one's a mouse, but willing. Now it's getting serious, will you look for a clean foreman? How do you know I'II do anything more here? Because you've got it under your belt. And what do you have under your belt? How much longer do you want to hang around in the dark? Why were you in court? My son... How old is he then? - 16. He's got no respect for me since I beat the competition. Should someone of that age have respect? Respect for what? Bodo, what are you doing? Are you crazy? Keep quiet. We're celebrating partly because of Wocke. Here you are. - It's stolen! Are you going to tell on us? Take it! Take it! What's all this noise? - Old fart! Come down here! Come on! That's Wahl's dog. You can't do that! Someone's coming! Now what? - No idea. Let the dog go. He's not mine. - You stole him. I don't want to see you with Nicole. She gets a rash from red socks. Because of you, I've not seen her for ages. You want to mess about with her. But I won't allow it. - What? Take that back! I have to go in. I didn't want to. - I knew. Here. For you. I meant to give it to you ages ago. Where did you get it? I don't believe it! I'm going up. - Stay here. Do you want to? Shit. What's that about? What do you want here? - Your forgiveness. OK. Now what? You'd have killed me in that cellar. I thought... I wanted to suggest... I'II study to be a builder in the autumn. - Good for you. I just wanted to work on a building site, but my father... You're doing what Daddy wants. - I'm going to Berlin. I thought we could look for a place together. If you're at sports school then... Really? - Really! Micha, it will be like before, only better! I have to train. - Easy for you! Fantastic music, a new life, great freedom! If you're free, Nicole will come and we'll get started. Forget Nicole! What? - She doesn't belong to you. I thought she belonged to us. What if Nicole wants something different to you? You're a compliant little wanker, who wants to look important because of a stupid break-in. Do you think she can't see that? - I wasrt like that. You were worse, you coward! - What are you then? Playing the big hero, making a big show. Nobody can talk to you any more. His social behaviour is often strange. His achievements sank to a dubious level in the last 2 years. The youth sports school would take him on, if we put in a word for him. We should doubt that a delegation from Michael Wahl would benefit the school's prestige. In times like these, we should think carefully about the signals we give. I've asked a classmate of Michael's to come to us. Alexander has been the class Party representative for 3 years. Can you say something about Michael that we adults have missed? Characteristics, abilities, talents which are lost in school routine. I don't think that Michael Wahl has the right socialist attitude. Everyone deserves a chance. Speak more loudly. You can't be heard. You're the Party representative? What's wrong? In my opinion, Michael doesn't have the maturity to visit the youth sports school as an example to others. I don't know... I'm so annoyed with you. I always wondered how it would be if you turned up here. I didn't want to come. I know I can't make things right. You never wanted to. That's what I mean - you've never considered trying it. That's not true. - It is true. You can pick your old car up. It's knackered. And if you hear anything about a job you can let me know. Micha!
