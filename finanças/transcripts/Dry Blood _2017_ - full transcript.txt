See you around. Anything I can help you with ma'am? Miss? No. Thank you. Look, I just want you to know... Plenty of time to talk later. Do you have any real coffee at your place? No, just that shit. I guess it'll have to do. I got it. That's $22 even. The fancy coffee arrives with our caviar shipment next week. Great. Thanks. I'll be back then. Jackass. I was making fun of you. Idiot. What the fuck did you do this time? People actually rent this place from you? Yeah, they actually do. Come here. Sit down. We just got here. Do we have to do this already? Yeah, and you just popped a fistful of pills after telling me you were serious about getting sober for the umpteenth time. So yeah, let's do this now. Okay. Here I am. How long have you been using again? I don't know. Jesus, Brian. Already? It's not that I don't know I didn't mark my fucking calendar, okay? I got high again, and I told you that. I know what you're asking. I started weeks ago or months ago. There's a pretty big difference between weeks and months. I know there's a big difference between weeks and months but you don't know how my fucking brain works. I know exactly how your brain works. Yeah, you know everything. Don't be an asshole. You want any? I didn't have to come here, you know? I know. I'm sorry. Be honest with me. Do you have any more shit at the house? Anything? Pills? Dope? Speed? No! You're not going to magically find another stash from a year ago? No. I swear to god. Why do you want to be sober? Why now? Does there have to be one reason? Just be straight up with me, Brian. Why am I here? I'm scared, okay? I'm fucking scared. Of? Of doing shit that I can't take back. Of shit that I can't even remember. What's the fucking point anyway? It's not even fun anymore. Isn't it supposed to be fun? It's not. It's just who I am. Like I'm just a fucking dope fiend. So, what happened? It's the same shit over and over again. No matter what choices I think I'm making, I'm not really making them because I end up back here in the same fucking hell. You have to forgive yourself first. I don't want forgiveness, okay? I want to feel everything, and I want it to hurt. Do you know I lied to you. Already. You came up here to help me. You came all this fucking way. And I spit in your fucking face, you know that? Cause all I really want to do right now is get fucking high. Jesus. What the fuck, Brian? What is that? What? I'm asking you, what am I holding in my hands right now? A hair ribbon. Good. So this is real. I'm experiencing this right now. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. So, this is is gonna be you. Again. Do you remember the last time we were here? It wasn't that long ago. It was another lifetime ago. For you? Yeah. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to It's good that you want to get sober right now. It's a good thing. Do you know how I know there's hope for you? How? This place. After all this time. You never sold it. You never put it in your veins. But it is in my veins. I mean, Meagan loved it. Another lifetime ago. No, that came out the wrong way. That's not what I meant. You're not still calling her, are you? I try not to. Brian, you either do or you don't. No, It's not like that. It's not like she wants to hear from me. Brian, leave her alone. It's not fair to her. If she's the only reason you're keeping this place, then maybe you should sell it. Or let her buy you out. It's not her. I mean, it's you. It's time we spent here. It's the way you look standing there in the light. Stop it. That's never going to happen again. I came here to help you. To try to be your friend. Don't to take advantage of that. I know. You're right. I'm gonna get real hard to be around, real fast. And, I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to get high really bad right now. Just don't let me do it again, okay? I can be better. I can be different. Okay? What are you doing up? Couldn't sleep? Anna? Brian! Anna, open up. Hold on. I hear you. What's going on? There's someone in the house. What are you talking about? Do you know what time it is? I heard you downstairs. I wasn't downstairs. I know. It wasn't you, cause it was a dead woman. You heard a dead woman downstairs? Come here. I'm not fucking high, alright. Calm down, okay? Just think about it. There isn't a dead woman downstairs, is there? Brian? Don't mind me. I'm just losing my fucking mind. I know if I think about it whe I see things that aren't there, I can rationalize it then. But when it's happening when it's right in front of my fucking eyes. Yeah, you're going through withdrawal. No shit. Well, the hallucination is not a coincidence. It doesn't make it any less frightening. I'm sorry. Don't be. That's why I'm here. Can I sleep in here with you tonight? Nice try. I didn't mean... like that. Okay, maybe a little bit. But, I don't want to go out there. Just not tonight. It's just in your mind. Is that better or worse? Thanks for making coffee. Did you end up getting any sleep last night? I can't be sure. It'll get easier. Hey, I'm sorry about that about last night. It's okay. It's so nice up here and quiet. Go easy Mr. Chimney. No thanks. What is it? When I got up this morning, I couldn't even come downstairs until the sun was up. I was afraid to come down in the dark, like a fucking child. It's not an easy thing you're going through. You can cut yourself some slack. Come here. I want to show you something Can you please open the drawer for me? Why did you...? I don't remember tying that ribbon on there, let alone, fishing it out of the trash. You'll even out. You'll see. It doesn't worry you that I'm playing with knives in my sleep? Because it fucking worries me. What worries me more is how disgusting this knife is. I hope you don't actually cook with it. Come on, I'll make us some breakfast. Oh, this is too much. Who is that? Just stay here. Hey buddy. Good morning. This is getting fucking weird, dude. What's getting weird? Can we not do this? Can we not pretend you don't know you're being an asshole right now? Whoa Brian, no need to call names. I'm just going to call your supervisor and report you. For what? Harassment. What's your badge number? My badge number? - Yeah. - It's, uh... 5-5-5-fuck-you. I'm just fucking with you, Brian. We're friends aren't we? I'd like to think so. You know, It's a big mountain. Not many people to play with this time of year. You know where a guy can score some dope around here? What? What? Oh, I didn't say anything. You have yourself a great day Brian. What was that about? That's about that guy being fucking crazy. And somebody thought it would be a good idea to give him a badge and gun. Well, between you, him, and that guy at the store, I'd say this town is not without it's charm. At least I'm in good company then, huh? Thank you. Thank you. Looks great. It's so great I don't want to cut into it. Are you sure that you cooked this the right way, cause I think I see a beak. What is it? It's nothing. Nothing? I thought I saw a deer. You're afraid of a deer? You know, I hit a deer once. I'd just turned sixteen. I'd just gotten my license. I borrowed my dad's car for the first and last time. It was early morning. I was out driving. Still dark. And this thing ran out. So fast I didn't even have time to tap the brakes. I couldn't even really see what it was. And, I hit it. That sucks. Yeah. Did it die? I think so, but it fell off into the shoulder, and I couldn't bring myself to look at it - to see what I'd done. I just got back in the car and drove away, like a fucking coward. Then how did you know it was a deer? Because I turned and I looked next to me. And in the passenger seat there was a man sitting there. Only he had the head of a deer. Right? And he's just staring at me. And he's blinking with these black eyes. Staring at me. That was the first time I really saw something that wasn't there. And I wasn't even high. So, what happened? Then I hit a light post and the airbag went off. And the car was fucked. It's so real. I can smell the blood. It's so strong it's on my taste buds. Like I have a mouthful of pennies. As if it were never there at all. Did you ever see a doctor about seeing things? Come on. Let's go back. It must be beautiful out here in the snow. Yeah. It is. Hey. I found this in the closet upstairs. It looks like it might fit you, right? Yeah, that's my dress. It was in your closet? Yeah. Eww. Do you think someone else wore it? I don't know. It looks pretty clean. You don't remember me in this dress? Hmm. I'm gonna grab a cub of coffee. You have a problem. You think? I'm gonna grab a smoke, alright? Okay. Son of a bitch. I thought you were gonna go smoke. Where'd you get those? You... see these? These are glasses, right? Yes. Where did...? Son of a bitch! What? They were in the kitchen. So? That cop, He wears glasses like these. I mean, these are his fucking glasses. What would he be doing in the kitchen? I don't know what he's doing in the kitchen. But that's it. That's enough. Who are you calling? Connect me to the White Deer Sheriff's office, please. Hello? Yes, I want to make a complaint about one of your officers. I don't know his name, but he's but he's a white guy. He's got dark hair. He's got a mustache. He's following me around. He's harassing me. And now he's coming into my house when I'm not home. Oh, hey there Brian. How you doing buddy? I hate to break this to you man, but this time of year, it's just me up here. Lone wolf. Keeping the herd in line. Stay the fuck out of my house. Brian! Your house. My house. What's the difference? I suspect you have a substance abuse problem, Brian. Would that be an accurate assessment? I could help you out with your little problem. I could lock you up in a dark dark place. Dry out your blood real fast. You want to get sober, don't you pal? Brian! What are you doing down there? Nothing. I'm coming up. Hold on. Jesus, one second. So? I thought I heard a rat. It was nothing. Alright? That fucking cop, man. He's freaking me out. Just do me a favor. If you see him. Just steer clear. If he comes to the door, and I'm not here, just don't answer it, okay? Where would you be? I'm just saying. I just have a really bad feeling. Like he's coming into my house when I'm not here. Like, maybe he's coming in all the time, when no one's home. When the place is empty. I don't know. I think you're being paranoid. Yeah, so they say. Come on. I'm coming. I brought you a towel. Jesus, Brian. Sneak up on a girl, why don't you? Sorry. You alright? Yeah, I'm fine. You just scared me. That's all. Anna? What is it? Can you come here please. Just... out of the dark. Brian, what is it? I want you to turn around. And tell me what you see, standing in the corner, behind you. Brian, there's nothing there. Shhhhh. It's okay. It's okay. It wasn't real. None of it was real. You're safe now. I've got you. It will be better in the morning. No, just lay back. You hit your head when you fell. Why can't it just be like this forever? Without all the other stuff. It's just not the way life works. What if I never get better? What if I can't be fixed? All the kings horses, and all the kings men... - Anna? - Yes? Can you indulge me one more crazy thought? Well, I guess if I've made it this far... What if that cop... Yes? What if he's hurting people in this house... when it's empty. What if he's actually killing people here, and I'm not crazy. I'm just, seeing... ghosts, I guess. Well, that is a theory. But your logic is flawed for two very big reasons. Why? One, we already know you're crazy. And two, there are no such things as ghosts. Nobody wants to be crazy, Anna. It's a horrible thing to not have control of your own mind. I know. I'm sorry. Can you stay with me until I fall asleep? I just feel like I haven't really slept in days. Right now, here with you, I finally feel safe. Sure. Get some rest. It will be better in the morning. I promise. Will you marry me? Fuck off. Just checking. Fucking stop it already. I don't believe you anymore. Jesus fucking Christ! Anna! Anna! Wait a minute! This is too much, Brian! Shhhhh. It's okay. It's okay. It wasn't real, whatever it was. It's okay. I'm just here with you, right now. I'm sorry. You're so good to me. Okay. No. Don't misinterpret why I'm here. Sorry. Don't do that. No, don't do that. Don't act like you're afraid of me. Like I'm fucking crazy. I didn't say that. Stop. Please stop. Leave me alone. Brian. You need to listen to me. You are scaring me now. I feel really uncomfortable. I just want you to leave. Just leave the room. Okay? Let me get dressed. We can talk after that. Downstairs. You're my only friend Anna. No one else stayed. I need help. I need help. I don't know if I can give you the kind of help that you need. You have to. You have to. We can talk in a minute downstairs, okay? We'll turn the lights on if you're scared. Just remember, none of it is real. It can't hurt you. Okay. It's not real. I'm going. Hey there Brian. No. Not her. It's been too late for that for a while, buddy. Anna? Anna? Anna? Anna? Hey buddy. You having a bad day? Brian. I need you to come out of that closet. I need you to step out with your hands first. And if I even think I see anything in your fucking hands I'm gonna blow a hole in you the size of Texas. I'm gonna count to three Brian. One. Two. Brian, if I have to open this door myself you are not gonna like it. God damn some of a bitch. No no no. Not that either. Why did you do it? She was my only friend. Did you kill all these people in my house? Shut up! Shut up! You don't get to cry! Shut up. Shut up. Shhhh. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Yeah, that. Yes. Come on. Just doing some cleaning. Where's your buddy? My who? Your cop friend that's always in here. I don't know. Probably out doing cop shit, I guess. I just ask ‘cause I saw his car out front. Oh, he's probably around back taking a shit. Mean ole shit, more'n likely. I forgot something. Alright. Brian. He can't see me. Oh my god, Anna. It's Brian. It's Brian. No. No. No, it's Brian. No, you're alright. Hold on. I'll take you to the hospital. I'm not to drunk to drive. I do it all the time. It's alright. No, don't die. It's alright. You're alright. You're alright.

They'll fix you. They'll sew you up, and you'll be pretty. After you He's not even supposed to be here, so Brian? Brian, where the fuck? Where are you? He's probably sleeping one off. Are you here? Well, he's not supposed to be here at all. Brian. Just a minute. I'm coming down, don't come up here. Okay, we're going to be in the kitchen whenever you want to get your shit together. Meagan Oh, I don't even care anymore. I'm coming down. It's alright. I'm fine. There you are. I was just... cleaning. Yeah, I can see that. The whole place reeks of bleach. It does? Look, I appreciate you wanting to clean up after yourself But you have to let me know when you're going to be up here so we can avoid this. This? Who you got up there with you Brian? No one. Oh my god. Are you high right now? It's not even noon. No. Hey, look what I found. Oh hi Brian. Todd. Not high, huh? How much was in that baggy? What was it this time? Coke? Speed? Heroin? And who the fuck is that whore behind you? What the fucking fuck! Shhh. You'll wake the baby. The baby? Well, she's not a baby anymore. Alecia. Todd's daughter. You want a snort? I'm trying to quit. Sure you are kid. And don't give me that shit about not drinking in front of you. I'm not the one with the problem. Why should I be punished just because you're a fucking drunk? Because you're my wife. Past tense. I don't even know what that means anymore. There he is. Come on, come one, there he is! Why should you care? You're not the one with the fucking problem. You know Brian, I look at you now, and I just think How the fuck did I ever fall in love with such a pathetic limp dick cock sucker like you? That's okay Meagan. You're not even here. What the fuck are you talking about? It's just me and me and me. Todd, will you get down here! Todd's not here either. It's just me. Todd! Todd! Fuck you Brian! Don't you ever fucking put your hands on me. Alecia, go to your room now! Wait! Is there anyone else left alive in here?! Or can I finally get some fucking sleep? I was just kidding. Okay. Okay. Get off of me! Help! I'll be quick. It'll be over so quick. You'll be with your daddy soon. It's all just a bad dream, little girl. Please don't cry. It'll be better in the morning. I'm gonna quit this time. I promise. No no no no. I was kidding. I was just kidding. I was kidding. It's not real anyway. It's okay. It's fine. It's fucking fine. It's alright. It doesn't matter. It's gone tomorrow. You're gone tomorrow. It's fine. I need a drink. I'll be back, okay? Anna. Hey, this is Brian. I was hoping you'd pick up. I think I'm going to take a trip out to the cabin and dry out again. I really need it this time. I was hoping maybe you'd want to come out and help me out with that. I'd love to hear from you. It's been a while. I guess that's it. Just call me back if you can, alright? Okay, thanks. I'm sorry. Subtitles by explosiveskull
