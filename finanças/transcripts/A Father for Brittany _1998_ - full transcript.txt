(MultiCom Jingle) (light jazzy music) - Keith? Keith, are you here? (answering machine beeping) - [Woman] Hi honey, it's Mom. You and Keith must still be at the doctor's office but call me as soon as you get in, okay? I hope it's good news. - Down, send, hut! (guys cheering) Yup, that's all, thank you very much. Let go of me now. Yeah you always did like Jack Best. Good job, man. Nice job, pal. (crowd chattering) There, there, she's looking at me. - [Keith] Her? - [Jack] Don't point, man! Yeah, she's looking at me, there. - [Keith] I don't think she's looking at you. - Yeah, right there. - [Waiter] Here we go, boys. - [Both] Wings. - [Waiter] Tuesday special. - Excellent. - Today's not Tuesday. - All day, buddy, yeah. - Today is Tuesday? - Mhmm. - We gotta go. - What's the matter? - Right now, let's go. - What? We just got here, what's the matter? Who you talking about? Hey what's going on? I got to see you next week, man. - [Waiter] You got it. (car revving) - Oh boy. Well, just be happy there's no gun in the house. There's always my couch, buddy. - I may need it. - Go get 'em! (car revving) (tense guitar music) (floor creaking) - Hi. Honey, I... I'm so sorry. - You could have at least called, you know. - I know, I know, I just... I thought it was Monday. Really, I did. (woman sighing) So... What happened, what'd this guy say? - Same thing Dr. Salomon said, that we should start thinking about adoption. - So then we'll just, we'll adopt, right? No big deal. Like you said, I mean there's a million kids out there that need a home. We'll get the best one. I'm sorry. - You taste like chicken wings. - I like when you talk like that. - Get away from me, I'm still mad at you. - No you're not. - Keith? - [Keith] Yeah, babe? - I wanna start looking now. - Okay. Now now? - Yes, now now. What's wrong? - Nothing. No, nothing, it just seems kind of sudden. - No it's not, we've been trying for a year. - I know, well trying, that's different. I'm real good at trying. - You'd be a real good dad too, Keith. - Oh, I know, I know. - I really want a baby, sweety. You know that, and with my job and maternity leave now, - I know. Let's just wait for you to, you know, come down off the fertility pills, okay? - It's not like this is some kind of irrational decision, Keith. - I know. I know. - So what do you think? - Hey where's the pot roast? (door creaking) (somber piano music) Are you asleep? - No. - Listen, I just had this flash when I was down in the kitchen. The pot roast was really good, by the way, way better than my mom's. Wanna know what it was? It was of me teaching a little kid how to pitch a baseball. - And how did that feel? - It felt pretty good. I gotta say, it kind of lit me up there for a while. - I'm glad. - [Jack] No, was she pissed off? - [Keith] Well, I did make a good point back then. - [Jack] Why didn't she beat you? - [Keith] I got to work. - You're kidding. (laughing) Guess you're not gonna do that again. - [Keith] Guess I'm not. - So what, you're gonna actually look for a kid? Who's already looking? - She is. We got a meeting with an adoption agency next week. - Wow. How long does that usually take? - Don't strain yourselves, girls. Wouldn't want any excuses when we kick your asses Saturday. - [Jack] Well thanks for your concern, sweetheart. Yeah yes. - [Man] Can I have an aisle search please? - So you actually think you're ready for this parenting thing huh? - Yeah, I guess. - Big change. You remember Callis. He got pretty snowed under. - Take a look at his wife. - What about Barney? I mean one week he's painting himself green and yellow for the Packers home opener then nothing. - Will you shut up? You're starting to sound like my mom. In the first place, Kim is gonna handle all the kid stuff. It's like she was born to be a mom. And the second, it's not gonna happen right away. These things can take years sometimes. - [Man] Hey, hey lady, look out! - Oh dear, oh, oh. - No, no. - Well, let's hope so for your sake. - Oh, great. Oh, great. Dammit Keith, you better be on your way. - Hey, you seen that new girl in dispatch? - Oh, here's your problem. Here's why you're leaking oil anyway. Your drain plug is cross-threaded. - Well you seen her? - Who? - Judy? - Yeah, that's her. (pager beeping) - [Keith] That my beeper? - It's Kim. (oil squishing) - Just a bit more tea for you. And let's see. - [Old Woman] Why don't we just get started, okay? - Okay, yeah, he's probably just tied up in traffic, that's all. - I see by your application that you're a speech therapist for the school district. - Yes, that's right. (tires screeching) (car revving) - I don't see any life insurance listed here. You're both gonna need some. - Yeah, my husband's definitely gonna need life insurance after today. (car revving) - Of course it's important that the husband be just as committed to the adoption as the wife is. - Mhmm. - That's why we don't allow single parent adoptions. - Right. (tires screeching) - That must be him. - Yes, it is, speak of the devil. (door slamming) - [Keith] Hi. (water splashing) (dishes clanking) - Really not ready for this, are you, Keith? - Sure, I am. I am. - You've thought about it. - Yeah, I thought about it. - Well so where does having a baby rank with say, playing football and playing golf and hanging out with the guys? - It's above football and hanging out with the guys and just below golf. Honey, come on, I'm kidding, I am kidding. - I'm not kidding, Keith. We're talking about having a child here, you know, being parents for the rest of our lives, and I would really like to know how you feel about it. - I feel fine about it. - You feel fine? - [Keith] Yeah. - So why'd you tell Edna that this was my idea? - [Jack] So when do you find out if you totally screwed this thing up? - [Keith] The approval's on Saturday. - [Jack] The day of the game? - Yeah. The agency's still checking us out, I guess, driving Kim crazy. She's already emotional as hell coming off her pills. Her stomach's not bothering her. I'm beginning to wonder whether the whole thing's worth it. - Oh, do not tell her that. - No kidding. - You two getting along all right? - Yeah, fine. I mean, then she thinks I'm an insensitive pig and all, but, - Yeah, yeah, besides all that. - You know I'll be fine if we get approved. I just hope I didn't blow it. - Hey Loosh! Saturday, man. Or if you want to save yourself the trouble, you can forfeit right now. (men laughing) - That guy's an idiot. - [Jack] We're gonna beat these guys. (whistle blowing) (players chattering) - [Man] Get it on the next play! - [Woman] Way to go, guys. Come on, guys. - All right, down, check, git! - One speedball, two speedball, three speedball, four speedball, five speedball. Ooh yes, ladies and gentlemen, 14 zip, hah! And the chump can't even get it over the line. - She beep? - [Friend] No, man, I told you I'd tell you right away. - It's important, we're supposed to find out today about the kid. - Yeah I know, you told me a hundred times. - Hey, Loosh! Come on, we don't have time for this, we're getting our asses kicked! - [Crowd] Yeah, yeah! - All right, guys, I gotta see this idiot two days a week at work, so let's get something going right now. Okay, Rick and John, you go long. Keith, you do a button hook, you'll blow right by 'em, they won't see you okay? On one, let's go. - [Team] Break! - [Man] On defense! - You're dead meat, Loosh! - Down set! Hike! (energetic music) - Let go! (pager beeping) - Keith! You're approved! - [Man] Where they at, Keith? - [Kim] It is, it's true. - [Keith] You are the best, you know that? - [Kim] I know. - [Keith] (laughing) The best girl I ever had. - [Keith] The only girl you ever had. (chuckling) - [Keith] Can you imagine if Mrs. Sawyer could see us now? - Oh. Keith Lussier, you come over here and sit next to Kimberly. She'll be a good influence on you. - Yeah, right. - Well here's to Mrs. Sawyer, third period English. - Here's to Kimberly Lussier. The beautifulest, sexiest mother to be in all of Wisconsin. - Oh, don't stop there.

Man, you're in there deep. This is a legitimately cute kid, man. Look at the cheeks on this thing. - (knocking) Kim? Kim, are you all right, honey? - Yeah, it's okay mom.

Watch the picture. - [Bob] Oh, it was his idea. He wanted to put it down, put it together downstairs. - Keith? Did any instructions come with this changing table? - Kim, where are the instructions to the changing table? - They're on the hall tabletop. - Watch the ceiling, watch the ceiling. Okay, where'd you want this, honey? - Here by the window, right under the window. - I'll move out of the way. - So this will have to go. - I really think it belongs in the corner. Who wants the baby in the direct sun? - [Keith] Ma. - This is the last move. - Got it? - Sure. (laughing) - Here? - [Kim] No, center it to the left a little. To the left, to the left. Stop, oh back a little. Okay, down. Right. - [Keith] Yeah? - Yeah. - This is great. - You know, on second thought, I think that I'm gonna... Just kidding, it's perfect, it's perfect. - I'll go see if Rob needs anything. - I'll go with you. Anybody want anything to eat? - [Kim And Keith] No thanks. - Thanks, Dad. - You're welcome, ow. (Kim laughing) - (sighing) I think it looks great. - Yup. Just watch out for the sunburn. - I mean I'm beginning to believe this is true, you know? There's gonna be a baby in here. - Yup. - Just wait till I get those curtains up, those beautiful lace curtains. There's gonna be enough shade. No sunburn for baby Brittany. - [Keith] Yeah. - And Keith, I'm really glad we went with teddy bears. They are so cute. I mean I can't believe this mobile we found. Look at all the teddy bears, it matches the border and the sheets that we got, the changing table. - Yeah, it's nice. - Hey, families! - Hi, Jack. - [Jack] Where's my boy? - [Donna] Upstairs! - I told you about this the other day, remember? - Don't worry about it, he'll come around. - Yeah? - Yeah, I'm serious. He's a hell of a lot better than I was when I was his age. - Oh, I doubt that. - No, I'm serious. Donna? - [Donna] What? - Tell her what kind of prospective young father was I? - [Donna] Terrible. - There, you see? I was into duck hunting in those days too. I used to come home smelling like wet dogs and cigars. And then you came along. And suddenly my golf game started slipping, the beer started tasting flat. - Oh, that'll be the day, dad. - Hey, I'm serious. You know why, because suddenly, I had this little girl whose face would light up when I walked into the room. And now you're gonna have a baby of your own. Oh, baby. (gentle music) Listen, don't you worry about Keith. He's got a good heart. And when this baby gets a piece of it he's gonna be a goner for her just like I am for you. - [Kim] Thank you, daddy. (clubs whooshing) (baby babbling and crying) - Hey Captain, we gonna do this? Hmm, good? This one's for you, kid. Oh yeah! - Not bad, Jacko, not bad. Okay I'm off a bit. (pager beeping) Be right back. - [Jack] Aw, man. (phone ringing) - This is Keith. Hi Bob, what's up? The hospital, what happened? (tense music) Uh huh, well what did the doctors say? I mean what are they saying? Yeah, right away, of course. I'm on my way. (car revving) All right, thanks a lot. - [Jack] You sure you don't want me to go in with you? - [Keith] No, no, I'm fine, thanks. - [Jack] All right, call me at home! (tense music) - [Announcer] Dr. Park to the ICU. Dr. Park, ICU. (people chattering) (equipment beeping) - Hi, baby. - Hi. - How you doing, sweety? - I'm not really sure yet. Is it cancer? - The doctor said so. - How bad is it? - Well they're not really sure. They want to operate right away. Do a complete hysterectomy. - You're going to be all right. We'll be with you every step of the way. - Guess we're not going to the movies tonight, huh dad? - Well, not tonight. - Wow, a hysterectomy. Unbelievable. Oh well, it was lousy equipment anyway. Thank god for adoption huh? What? - Nothing. - Is there something wrong? Is there a problem? - No, the doctor just thinks maybe we ought to just, put it on hold for a minute, just till we see what we're dealing with here. - No, but that means. What, no Keith we can't, we could lose Brittany. - [Keith] I know. - I mean she's practically here! - I know honey, let's just see what we're dealing with. Okay, I'm sure you'll be up on your feet soon. (gentle somber music) Hi, Edna. It's Keith Lussier. - Hi, Keith. Look, I'm just on my way up but tell Kim that we still don't know when the baby's due in. There's nothing wrong, though. It's just the same old bureaucratic runaround. - No, no, I'm not really calling about that. It's about Kim. - [Edna] Yeah? - Boy, it's hard to just come right out and say. It turns out well, it turns out that she has cancer. - Oh no. Oh my god, no. - Yeah, yeah. We're all kind of in shock here. We still don't know how bad it is yet, but listen, what I was wondering, was well, you know, if it's not too serious and Kim gets back on her feet fairly soon, see? And she's really got her heart set on this. And I mean, we named her Brittany and everything. Now I know we're gonna have to postpone this for a little while but what I was wondering is if maybe she could just stay in Korea for a little while longer, just till we see what we're up against. - Keith, we can't do that. But there are any number of other children. - I know, I know. But see, after getting the picture and everything, I got it right here. Kim made copies of it for all our friends and stuff. It's like she's already ours. And now, after this, it's gonna really devastate her to have to give her up. - [Edna] I'm really sorry but, there's nothing we can do. This is a baby girl, we can't just put her back on the shelf. - I know, I know. - [Edna] But you call me just as soon as Kim's out of the woods, okay? Okay, Keith? - Yeah. Yeah, I will. - [Edna] And I'm really sorry about this. Tell Kim I'll be praying for her. And Keith, you take care of yourself too, okay? - Okay. - [Edna] We'll find you a wonderful child, Keith, I promise you. Okay. - Okay, thanks. Bye. (light music) Nice and slow. - Welcome home, dear. - It'll just be a minute. We'll be right down. I don't know how we'll get rid of everybody. I don't know what she was thinking. - No, no it's fine, it's fine. I just need a minute to get my breath is all. All right, you go tell the others. I'll be right there. (gentle music) (guests chattering) - Look out, look out, these are hot. Look out. - Oh, here we go. Wait, let me get another one. - [Marge] Put something under here, will you? - Sorry I had to take all these. - [Marge] There you go. (guests chattering) - You okay? - Ah! Here she is. - I'm fine. I'm great. I have an announcement to make. I just talked to Edna and guess what? We're getting Brittany after all. - [Keith] What, what? - Yeah. - Oh, Kim. That's wonderful! - [Kim] Yeah, I thought so. - But how? Now what happened? - Did you tell her what the doctor said? - Yes, I told her exactly what he said, that they got 99% of the cancer and they're confident that I'll make a full recovery. So. There you go. - Wow! - [Marge] Grandbaby! - We are! - I'm so happy. - There you go. - [Donna] Wonderful. - Let's leave it. - Oh Keith, this is crazy. - What? - You heard what the doctor said. This is a very aggressive kind of cancer and they didn't even get all of it. I mean who's gonna look after this little baby when she's having chemotherapy? - Everybody's gonna help. - Her family knew about his, didn't they? - No. - Nobody even thought to talk to us about it. - Marge! - Look. This is something that's going to affect all of us. Now Kim is in for a long, hard fight. I don't think this is any time for them to bring a little baby into the house. Did you talk to Dr. Sorram about it? - No, but he's very optimistic. You heard him, she's young, she's strong. - And she still has cancer. - And they got 99% of it, mom. - Meaning they didn't get all of it. Look Keith, listen to me. I'm not saying that Kim isn't gonna come through this just fine. But with chemotherapy and everything, Keith, she's gonna get a lot worse before she gets better. And with a little baby to raise, this is not fair to the child, Keith. - What am I supposed to do, go in there and tell her she can't have it? - Are you ready to start raising a baby? Now I want you to think about that, Keith. And then you go and talk to Kim. - Marge, let's go. Keith. (somber guitar music) (light music) - Marge gave you an earful, huh? - Well. She's just concerned, is all. - Come here. Come here. I'm gonna promise you something, okay? - Yeah? - I promise that this baby is gonna be the best thing that ever happened to us. Okay? - Okay. - It's true. And you're gonna be the greatest, greatest dad. - Can I still play a little golf? - Absolutely not. (Kim laughing) (phone ringing) - [Donna] Hello? No, this is her mother. Oh hi, Edna. Any news? (truck revving) I shouldn't have let Bob do the shopping! How are we ever gonna find what we need? Now we need formula, we need wet wipes. We need... - All right just give me a second. I want to get a shot. - How many kids are we getting? It's like Desert Storm in here. - Mom, don't forget Little Piggy. I'm gonna wait up for you guys, okay? And call me as soon as you get to the airport. - Honey, we're not even gonna be back till like three in the morning. - I don't care. I'm gonna wait, okay? - Whoa, whoa. Hold it now, I wanna get a before picture here, all right? Everybody. (camera clicking) Haha, great! - Good bye. - Hurry home, Mr. Dad. - Good bye. See you. - Drive carefully, huh? Let me get a shot. - Dad, stop it. (camera clicking) (clock ticking) (Bob snoring) - Okay, here. (keys clinking) Watch it, watch it. Okay. Come on. Honey? Honey? Guess who's here? (gentle music) - Hi there. Hi. So pretty. Look at you. Daddy, look. - I wanna see this kid. Oh, baby I'm so happy for you. Look at that hair on this kid! I mean, kinda she takes after her old man huh? - Yeah. - Take a picture, daddy. Take a picture. - Yeah yeah yeah. - Look at you, baby girl. Keith, look. - Yeah, she's beautiful. - Look at you sweet girl. - Okay now. - Here, Keith. You come take her, okay? - Oh, no, it's okay. - Here we go, come on. Keith, you get in. - It'll be okay. Really, come sit. It's really okay. Just be careful of her head. Support it. There we go. - Hi. - What do you think, mom? - Smile. - She's wonderful. (camera clicking) - Keith, smile. Smile. (gentle music) That's it, that's it. - [Keith] Kim, it's a trap. They're trying to trick us, I'm telling you. - [Kim] Keith, will you relax? - See, this is what they do. They tell you at three o'clock just to get you relaxed and they come at two just to get you off guard. - She had a cancellation, sweetheart. - Huh? - She had a cancellation, honey. - Yeah, right. - Hello, pretty girl. There we go, all this free stuff. Ah, pretty lady, little baby girl. Keith, could you come here for a minute please? - What? - Could you finish dressing her, please? - [Keith] Yeah, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Just, I'll be right back. Here's her dress. Excuse me, bye bye. - Hello, baby. Okay. Oh boy. Honey? She's here! Kim? Okay, give me your arm. (door knocking) Hi. Come on in. (baby crying) - Oh, sweety, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. - Maybe she's hungry. - No, no, no, I just fed her. It's okay. - Yeah. How's she doing then? - Hey, baby, you should try then. - Oh, come here, baby girl. Oh, oh baby! Oh! (baby shrieking) - [Kim] Maybe you should try the Sunday Speedway thing, you know? - Huh? - It's really fun. - [Keith] Are you sure? - [Kim] Yes, please, honey. - Okay. Vroom, Sunday ladies and gentlemen. Heat it up to the dragsters burning off the line, Brittany Lussier! (hectic music) (baby giggling) (tires screeching) Turn, turn! Turn four, turn four! Reverse! (Edna laughing) Good as new. - Here's my girl. Oh, I think Daddy and Brittany came in first place. Yes it is, yes it is. What a good girl. Yes, who's a pretty girl? - Believe me, I see a lot of adoptive fathers who don't know how to get down to a child's level. - Well that's never been a problem for Keith. - Because the social worker was a little worried when you weren't there at the airport. It's never happened before. It's the first time an adoptive mother wasn't there for her baby's arrival. - Well you told me about another woman who had cancer. She must have been flat on her back for a while. - Yes she was, for a while. So long. - Oh, don't worry about that, honey. I mean, who knows what this other woman had? - Edna told me she had uterine cancer. - Well yeah well, so, maybe they caught it a little sooner. What's the matter? I thought we did really great today. - You had me scared there for a while though. - I know, I almost gave Britt whiplash going through turn four. Oh, what is it, hmm, hmm? - Keith, would you quit? I just, it's nothing, I'm sure, it's just that I... Today, I think I felt a lump, another. Do you feel that? - Right there? - Yeah. - It's probably just a reaction to the chemo. - Honey, chemo's supposed to shrink tumors, you know? - No baby, I don't think that's a tumor. (somber music) Look, we're gonna see the doctor on Thursday. We'll ask him about it then, but don't worry. - Yeah. - Okay now, as you can see right here, this dark spot. This is where the tumor's grown back. And we've also got one here. Now, I want to remind you again that just because this particular kind of chemo wasn't successful, doesn't mean that another kind won't be. - Okay, so what's next? - Well, I'm afraid we're gonna have to operate again as soon as possible. - Oh god. - [Doctor] In fact, I'm already getting recommendations from some of the best oncologists. Literally, the best in the world. - [Donna] Oh, she can't go through with that. (Brittany crying) She can't. - [Bob] Well she's gonna have to go through it. - [Donna] She can't. - [Bob] Come on now, come on. You know it's the best thing. The doctor says that we've got the best of the best doctors coming in, right? - [Donna] She can't go through this again. She can't. - [Bob] She's gonna have to go through. (thunder rumbling) (somber music) - It's rain, yeah. Your mommy's sick, you know that, baby? Your mommy's sick. - So you pinch the skin, hold the needle at a 45 degree angle, press in smoothly, depress the plunger, pull it out. It's that easy. - Now can I give her one if she starts being a pain in the ass? (nurse chuckling) (light music) - Oh, it's okay. Oh, daddy will be just a sec. It's okay. - Oh, what's the matter, Brittany? Oh! (Brittany crying) Okay. - (shrieking) Daddy. (Brittany giggling) Dada? (Brittany giggling) (Brittany shrieking and laughing) - [Keith] Snowball, yeah? Ow! (Brittany laughing) - And the baby bear looked around the room and saw the three chairs. And then Papa Bear says, yeah, that's the Papa Bear. And the Papa Bear said in his great big voice, "Somebody's been sitting in my chair." And then the Mama Bear looked at her chair and she said in a medium sized voice, "Someone's been sitting in my chair as well." And then Baby Bear, yeah, that's the one like you. Baby Bear said in this really small little voice, "Someone's been sitting in my chair too and it's broke all to piece! Oh man, it's terrible!" (gentle music) No that's not for baby standing on. Just turn the page. Oh, that's Mama Bear telling Baby Bear be quiet since Daddy Bear was upstairs, you see that? And then the three bears thought they'd better search the house so they quickly went upstairs! See, see they're going to the stairs. And then Papa Bear, one look at the bed and he said in a great big voice, "Somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Let's turn the page. Mama bear looked at her bed and she said in a medium sized voice "Somebody's been sleeping in my bed as well." - What day is it? - It's Friday. - What's the date? - It's March the 6th, why? Hmm? - I love you so much, daddy. (Bob sighing) Daddy. - What? - I'm pretty much through fighting this. I think I can let it all go now. - Oh, Kimmy. - Where's Keith? - He went to get the baby. - Oh, no. - [Marge] Where's Brittany? - She's with Aunt Tess. How's she doing? - She wants to see you. - Hi, baby. (gentle music) I was gonna bring her, but... - It's okay. - [Keith] I just thought- - You're right. You're a good dad, Keith. You've done great. You take care of her now, okay? - I love you so much. - Don't cry. You stay strong for her. (somber music) (light music) (baby babbling) (mobile clacking) - In many ways, life is like a river of time sweeping us down through the years. If we're lucky, we're swept along through the sunlight and shadows with someone we truly love. So it was with Kim and Keith, sweethearts since high school. (Brittany giggling) Keith, spontaneous, free-spirited, and Kim, wise beyond her years. Even in her darkest moments when the rest of us were reduced to tears, (Brittany babbling) Even in her darkest moments, when the rest of us were reduced to tears, Kim stayed strong, comforting us, insisting, (Brittany babbling) insisting that we stay positive, that we really mustn't cry for her. And although we all really must cry, sometimes it's part of the healing process, I can see that little Brittany has taken her mother's advice to heart. (congregation chuckling) (light music) - [Woman] Gosh, I'm so sorry. If there's anything we can do. - So we're doing fine, especially Britt. She's great. She's happy and she's almost standing on her own. Listen, I just, I just wanted to let you know how much, how much Kim appreciated everything that you did. I know we got the finalization coming up soon and everything so give me a call when you have the chance. Okay, thanks, bye bye. Come on, babe. - [Donna] So what'd she say? - I just left a message. - Thank you for letting us look after Brittany. - Oh, it's the first time I've left her. - Oh, she'll be fine. Now you need some time to yourself. - Okay now, there's a bottle in there if she gets hungry, okay? - Go, go. - All right, I've got my beeper, so - Keith. Relax. - If you need me I'm just a call away. I'll be at my folks, - Relax. - And then down at the field. My bag. - The baby's gonna be fine. Come on. (Brittany babbling) (gentle music) (phone ringing) - Bob? Bob, can you get that? Bob? Hello? No, no, I'm sorry he isn't. Who shall I say is calling? Oh, Edna. This is Donna. Sorry, Kim's mother? Oh yes. (breathing heavily) I'll tell Keith it's you. Bob? Bob, come and take Brittany. I need to call Keith right away. (Bob sobbing) - [Robert] Your mom just thought it'd make things easier on you. - Right. You know what I mean, right? It's the only home that Brittany's ever known. I can't just move back here. - She's worried about you, Keith. Fair enough. A thing like this can knock the pins out from under anyone. - Well I think I'm doing okay. - Sure you are, you're doing just fine. - It's not like I'm gonna freak out or anything. What's the point of that? I just want to try and keep things as normal as possible for Brittany. It's all I care about. - Do me a favor, okay? - Mmm? - You can let your guard down sometimes. (phone ringing) No good keeping it all bottled up inside. - [Marge] Keith? It's Donna on the phone. - Hi, everything okay? Oh well, that's just the way she is sometimes. Don't worry. I'll call her back and set it up for Friday. Sure, sure, of course you can come. No, no. It's okay. - So what did he say? - Says he's doing fine. - Everything okay? - Yeah, fine. Listen guys, I'm gonna head out. - What was Donna calling about? - Oh, Edna called. We're gonna try and finalize the adoption on Friday. - Are the Mankowitzes going? If they are, we should be going too. We're your parents, after all. - All right, let me call you tomorrow, mom, okay? Dad. - [Robert] Bye, Keith. (car revving) (gentle somber music) - [Marge] Anyway, you could rent the house. You don't have to sell it. - Mom, I am not renting the house, all right? In the first place, I'm not going back to work for a while. And when I do, you can come over to our house and watch her there with you know, Aunt Tess, the Minks and everybody else. - (chuckling) What are all gonna have our own little schedules? I can watch her most of the time. That rent money might come in pretty handy. - Ma, I'm not renting the house. Just let it go, will you? (birds chirping) - [Bob] Robert. - Bob. - We got here a little early. Anticipating. - [Donna] Look who's here! - Nice house. - Yeah, tell me about it. - Donna. - Hello. Beautiful home. - Yeah, it sure is. (doorbell ringing) - Hey cutie. - Hello. - Oh my goodness. - [Keith] Oh, these are my in-laws and my folks. - How do you do? I'm Edna Humphries. Come on in. - I'm Donna. - Can I offer anybody anything? Something to drink? - No thanks. - Keith, Mrs. Lussier? - No thank you. - No? Well okay. Well, let's get started. First of all, Mrs. Sergeant, she's the founder of our agency, wanted to be here today but there was a small emergency at the head office so she couldn't make it. But she and I have talked at great length and, (Brittany babbling) she certainly likes to read, doesn't she? - Yeah. Yeah, she hardly ever cries too, she eats anything you put in front of her. - I think she's the healthiest baby I've ever seen. - Yeah. She's teething a bit now so she's gets a little fussy, but she's great. - Keith is a wonderful father. You should see him with her. We can hardly get him out of the house. Of course he has a wonderful support system if he would just let Marge and me be grandmas once in a while. - So when is the adoption finalized? - Well. We have a problem. We don't really allow single parent adoptions. - What do you mean? - I went over and over it with Mrs. Sergeant. She won't even consider it. - Wait, wait a minute, wait a minute. - It has nothing to do with you being a good parent, I want you to understand that. - Are you saying that you're not gonna go through with this? - I'm afraid so. It's been the agency's policy since the beginning. No single parent adoption. - No wait, there's got to be something that we can do. - There isn't. - Well how's this gonna work? What'll happen to Brittany? - I'm afraid I'm gonna have to place her with another family. - Oh no you won't! - What?! - [Marge] I knew it. I knew something was wrong! - Mom, please. - They want to take this child, Keith! - Mom please! Dad, will you help me out please? Edna, come on, there's something we could do here. - Keith, listen, I've been pleading with Mrs. Sergeant all week long. It's all my fault. - What if we can convince, what if we can prove to her that Keith has all the support in the world? We can bring in Aunts, Uncles, anybody. - Wont' do any good. - [Bob] How do you know? You don't know. We could set up a schedule, have everybody's times laid out. - Or we could adopt Brittany. Me and Bob. - [Edna] No. - This isn't over yet. - But she belongs. - [Bob] This isn't over yet. We'll work it out. - Bob. - I'm afraid you're gonna have to leave the baby with me. - What, now, today? - This doesn't make any sense. - Yes. - [Marge] What's she talking about? - [Robert] You haven't heard the last of us. - What if I don't? What if we just walk out the door with her? - You can't. You have to understand, this baby is not legally yours. I'm sorry, I am so sorry. - Doesn't make any sense. - I'm sorry. - Let's not make a scene. - [Donna] Is she saying that they're going to take her away? - [Bob] They're saying- - [Edna] I'm sorry, I am so sorry. - [Robert] This is crazy! (somber music) - It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be all right. Listen, Keith. Soon as we get back, we'll call our lawyer. You know there's gotta be something that we can do to fight this thing. - [Robert] Let's go. - [Bob] You know? - [Robert] Let's go. Let's go, Keith. (tense music) - Wait. - [Robert] Keith. (door knocking) Keith? (doorbell ringing) - Edna! I forgot Brittany's toy. Edna! Edna, Edna, she can't sleep without Mr. Pig. (door knocking) Edna. Edna! (door knocking) Edna. Edna, she can't sleep without Mr. Pig. (car starting) - [Man] Is that the same problem? - No. - All right, have you worked out their schedule? - Not yet. Do you want a high rate than.. - Yeah. Keith, I gotta be honest with you. This will be an uphill battle all the way. First of all, this Edna Humphries was right. Your contract with the agency specifically forbids any single parent adoptions. It also rules out adoptions to anyone with a life-threatening disease. - She got sick after we signed it. - Okay, let's move on to the question, what's in the best interest of the child? A life with you, a single guy on an hourly wage or a home with a well-to-do couple who already have another adopted child? - Is that who they have lined up? - No, that's where she's been placed. The couple with the Volvo? - They didn't waste any time. - No, no, they didn't. And that's not all. We haven't even talked about the court's usual bias against single fathers. Let's move on to the question of your commitment. - My commitment? - Kim first contacted the agency. She made all the appointments, she filled out all the forms. She wrote out all the checks. So if I'm their lawyer, I'm gonna say where was Mr. Lussier during all this and why? Why was he late to that first rather crucial appointment? Well, he was out playing golf or football, or he was bowling. - You know... It's true, I didn't get it at first. But then when Brit showed up, I held her in my arms and... So what are you saying? Are you saying that it's hopeless, I'm never gonna get Britt back? - No, no. I'm not saying that at all. But what I am saying is that the deck is stacked against you, Keith. You better think long and hard about that before you decide to go ahead with this. - [Marge] So how much is this lawyer going to cost? - 2500 for the retainer. - Ooh. - And then it depends on how hard the adoption agency fights us in court. - Which is probably pretty hard. - And all this is gonna take place in Milwaukee? - Yeah, that's where the agency's home office is. - That's a four hour commute. - Well. At some point I think that I would probably end up staying down there with Sam. That's his name, Sam Turturro. That's where his office is. He's supposed to be one of the best there is. - Look, Keith, I don't want you to misunderstand this, okay? But you got to remember that you got your whole life ahead of you, and right now you are in a pretty emotional state. - I'm not in an emotional state, mom, I'm fine. - You're fine? You've just lost your wife. Keith, your whole world has been turned upside down. - I promised Kim I'd take care of Brittany. - Well, the lawyer says Brittany is in a good home with good people. - Who are not her parents, I am. I'm the only father she's ever known, Ma. - Keith, she's a baby. And all I'm saying is that you need time for all of this to sink in. - But I don't have time! - Well you should find some time! They're not gonna save your job for you forever. And you're talking about spending thousands and thousands of dollars on something that really, we cannot afford! - I have money of my own, and the Minkowitzes were gonna help. - Oh yes, of course, the Minkowitzes. - Marge. - What are you all gonna do, just waltz in there and give all this money to a lawyer who doesn't even know if he can win it? - That's not the point, mom. - It is the point! He already told you. The court is not on your side. They very seldom ever reward custody to a single father! - You think that's fair? - No I don't think it's fair, but that's the way it is, Keith and you're not going to change it. - Let me ask you something, ma. How much would you spend to get me back when I was eight months old? - That's not the same thing. - It is exactly the same thing, you just don't want to see it. In fact now that I think about it, I'm just doing the same thing you're doing. I'm just trying to get my kid back. - I'm not... That's ridiculous. - No, it's not ridiculous! I'll tell you what's ridiculous, mom. I'm a grown man, you're treating me like I'm in high school. Just let me finish! I am Brittany's dad. And like any good dad, I don't care what it costs. Now I am going down to Milwaukee and I am gonna do whatever it takes to get my kid back! All I got to say about this. Let's just finish our dinner. - Well we'll help you any way we can, son. Can I have the salt please, Marge? (men chattering) - [Sam] Relax, you'll be fine. - The whole thing, it just seems kind of, I don't know, sleazy. - Look, Keith. Our best chance of getting her back is to put pressure on the agency and touch people's hearts. Listen to me, listen to me. If we pull this off, we're gonna get a lot more exposure down the line. All right, now straighten your tie. And smile for the camera. (reporters chattering) - Sam, are you satisfied with this judge's decision to hold a full adoption hearing? - Yes, we are. We're delighted with the decision. It's all we wanted all along is the chance to plead our case in open court, and prove that it was in Brittany's best interest to be reunited with Keith here. - [Reporter] Keith, have you seen Brittany? Have you had any contact with her? - Rob, hurry, he's on! - No I haven't but I'm sure she's being well taken care of. - Rob? - If you lose the case, will you appeal? - He's on. - No I won't. - Why not? - Well from what I understand an appeal can take up to a year more and I just don't think that would be the best thing for Brittany. - And so the stage is set for a custody battle that seems to have captured the public's imagination and heart. Since the story broke on a Milwaukee television station a week ago, Keith Lussier has been swamped with letters of support, and with requests to appear on talk shows and newscasts all across the country. There's even a petition being circulated by other adoptive parents, some of them clients of the Good Home Adoption Agency itself urging its founder Edith Sergeant to let the little girl return to Lussier. And on yet another front, the case has also become something of cause to live for single fathers. Especially when it was learned that the Milwaukee based agency had actually allowed some single parent adoptions. But in every one of those cases, the parent was a mother. - [Reporter] Keith, how tough is this case? - Oh, well. Gosh, I don't know. It's been tough. I mean, since I lost Kim I haven't really had a chance... Anyway, it's pretty hard. All I'm trying to do here is get my daughter back. - So you're gonna be making the talk show circuit now? - Oh, I don't know about that. - [Sam] Just a few of them, maybe. - So how long has it been since you've been home? - It's been a little while. - I'm sorry that everything is such a mess. He hasn't had time. Oh, excuse me, he did face all that. (phone ringing) - Bedroom is upstairs for the baby. I don't know where you wanna start. (men chattering) - Hello? - Hi, Donna, it's me. Did they get there all right? - [Donna] Oh, yes, yes, they're here. They're just starting now. - Okay. - Hold on a minute. - Chuck. What I wanna do is let's start with a close up of the high chair, okay? And then we'll tilt up and we'll pan around the room, okay? - Sorry, I'm just trying to stay out of the way here. - I really appreciate it, Donna. It shouldn't take them that long. - Oh, that's okay. We're glad to help. So how's it going down there? - Oh, it's kind of crazy, but you know, the more support we get, the better chance we have so, - When are you coming home? - Well, I'm not really sure, I mean, I got the hearing coming up and everything, so. - Oh, we saw you on the news. - Oh, I was nervous. - [Donna] You looked very handsome. - Thanks, you just speak as a mom. - Yeah, yes I am. I think it would be really good if you could come home for a few days. Or just, just maybe in a day. I'm sorry. - Are you okay? - I mean I know you're busy and I don't mean to be a pest, but I just, I just need to go through her things. And you do too. I mean, I know it's hard but you can't keep avoiding it. I don't mean, I don't mean... I'm sorry, honey. - Hey, buddy, how you holding up? - Oh, fine, fine. Listen, I'm sorry I can't get home right now. - Hey, listen, you do what you have to do. Brittany comes first. We're all behind you on that, you know that. Listen, there's an insurance guy gonna be getting in touch with you down there. - Okay, what for? - Excuse me folks. We're about to start rolling. - Okay, thanks. Listen, don't worry about it. It's just some paperwork. I'll call you about it later, all right? - [Keith] Okay. - Give him my love. - Did you hear? - Yeah, yeah. Send her my love too, all right? Thanks, thanks a lot. - You take care of yourself, huh? - You too. Bye. (somber music) - Brittany's high chair, jars of baby food, everything left just as it was. So in this little house on the outskirts of Madison, far away from the reporters and the need to appear calm and composed, Keith Lussier mourns for his wife alone. Sitting in this empty room surrounded by old pictures and photo albums, all they can do now is try to get through another day without her, and fight for the little girl that both of them thought was their own. This is Paul Jacobs reporting. (cars honking) - The battle for Brittany nears its climax today here at Milwaukee's historic courthouse in the courtroom of Judge Harriot Richardson. - [Reporter] A child would have a mother and a father. And that is the real issue here. Lussier may be a good father, - The court of public opinion will carry over to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. - News today that this is the day that Keith Lussier was waiting for since his adopted daughter was taken from him two weeks ago. Judge Richardson will very shortly hear arguments and decide whether baby Brittany should be returned to her adoptive father. One person very interested in that decision is Edith Sergeant, founder and president of the Good Home Adoption Agency. Mrs. Sergeant, what do you think of Mr. Lussier's claims that your agency mishandled baby Brittany's case? - There is nothing wrong with the way we handled the situation. We promised the child's biological mother that her baby would have a loving father and mother. - But all accounts, Mr. Lussier is a good father. - That is not the issue. The issue is what's best for the child, not what's best for Mr. Lussier. - Your honor, let's be clear about something. This child was placed in this couple's home on a temporary basis, with a written understanding that their eligibility would be reviewed six months down the line. Now, what the agency did not know at the time because it had not been fully informed was that Kimberly Lussier had a life-threatening disease. If it had known this, the agency would never have place a child with this couple in the first place. Only after Mrs. Lussier's death did the agency learn of this tragedy. And as difficult as it was, the agency ultimately made a decision that was in the best interest of the child. Namely, to remove it from what was now a house of mourning, place it in a more stable home where there was already another adopted child. Thank you, you honor. I kept my remarks brief, we are anxious to proceed. - First of all, your honor, not only did Mr. Lussier fully inform the agency about the severity of his wife's condition, but this was well in advance of the baby's arrival. In fact, Kim was undergoing chemotherapy when Edna Humphries called her to tell her when the baby was coming in. Secondly, in regards to this house of mourning suggestion by Mr. Schiller, nothing could be farther from the truth. It was at Kim's insistence herself that no one even cry around the baby so as not to upset her. "We've all got to stay positive for Brittany", Kim was always saying, and that attitude continues to this day with Mr. Lussier. Thank you. But it was a week later after the operation that Kim called you herself, didn't she? Soon as she got home from the hospital. - [Edna] Yes, she did. - [Sam] And what did she say, Mrs. Humphries? - [Edna] She said that the doctors had gotten 99% of the cancer and that they were confident the chemotherapy would take care of the rest. - [Sam] And did you believe her? - [Edna] I wanted to believe her. - Why? - Why? Because she was a lovely young woman full of life. And because they had named the baby and the nursery was all set up. - [Sam] And so, why was it that she was calling you? - She wanted to know if they could still adopt this particular child. - And as you said, you knew she had cancer at that time. Did you ask to see any medical reports or tell her you wanted to talk to her doctors? - No. - [Sam] Well what did you tell her? - I told her that... That we would just keep this to ourselves because I was sure she was gonna be fine. - And? - And... That the baby was still theirs. I wouldn't say a word to anyone. (cameras clicking) (reporters chattering) - [Reporter] Does this make your case for you, Sam? Is it all welcome? - No, no, no, not by a long shot. We still have the whole single parent debate to go and what's best for the child now. We're not calling this one over until Judge Richardson renders her verdict and hopefully Baby Brittany is returned to her father. - [Reporter] And when do you expect the verdict? Do you expect the verdict today? - Well we still have an awful lot of testimony to go, so. - [Reporter] Keith, are you taking the stand this afternoon? - I believe so, yes. - Is that your signature at the bottom of the contract, Mr. Lussier? - Yes. - Would you please read stipulation nine? - No couple with a known life-threatening health condition shall be approved. But the point is we didn't know. - I'll ask the questions, Mr. Lussier. Yeah, one that's been bothering me since the beginning is this. Why did you leave this child with a stranger in the first place? - Objection, your honor. Edna Humphries was not a stranger. - She was to the child, Mr. Turturro. Overruled. - I mean, you maintain that she was absolutely like your very own daughter. - [Keith] Yes. - And yet you left her in Madison that day, a child crying as you walked away. So tell me, Mr. Lussier. What kind of a parent would leave their child like that regardless of the circumstances? - Edna said that she was going to have to call the police. - Because the child wasn't legally yours which is exactly why you left her, isn't it? You recognized that fact. - No, that's not true. - Then why? Why would you leave a crying child in someone else's arms? - I left her because... I left her because sometimes even though it breaks your heart you have to do what's right for the kid. Of course I wanted to take Brittany away with me that day and then never let her go but then at the same time Edna had said that they were gonna call the police and get a court order and... You know, I had this image, this picture in my head. It's crazy, but of us just racing down the highway in this chase. And the police pulling us over, and Brittany crying, and the trip was just taken away. So yeah, I left her with Edna. But I promised her that I would be back for her and that's what this is all about, Mr. Schiller. I'm just trying to keep the promise I made to my daughter. I'm just trying to get my daughter back. - Excuse me, gentlemen. Sorry to interrupt. I'm Elliot Carver with Superior Mutual Insurance. I know you're busy, but if I could have just a few minutes with Mr. Lussier here- - About what? - About his wife's life insurance. - It's all right, Sam. You already talked with my father-in-law, didn't you? - [Elliot] That's right. - About what exactly? I'm sorry, but is there some kind of problem here? - Well that's what I'm supposed to find out. The adoption agency is obviously claiming that Keith and his wife knew she was ill before the adoption. Which means they concealed this on their information. - We didn't know. - You know, I think we're gonna have to talk about this another time. - No, no, no, don't misunderstand me. I believe you, I really do. That's what I've written in my report. In fact, off the record, I want to tell you how much I admire your wife hanging on until the activation date. - What do you mean? - Well, for the six months, I mean. You didn't know? - Know what? - Mr. Lussier, the policy you bought didn't come into effect until six months after the date of signing. That was on March the 6th. Kim had it marked on the calendar according to her father. She held on until the night before and then went back to the hospital the following day knowing that by then you and your little girl would be provided for. (rain pattering) (light music) (gentle somber music) (thunder rumbling) - It's good to see you, Keith. - It's weird. It's like I don't even believe it yet, you know? Sometimes, the phone rings. And then oh, it's Kim! Or I'll be driving down the street and I'll see something and I think, I can't wait to get home. I guess I feel like that if I get Brittany back I'll be getting part of Kim too. I miss her so bad. (sobbing) (thunder rumbling) (reporters chattering) - And so this is it, decision day. At nine o'clock this morning in department 14 at Milwaukee's historic courthouse, Judge Harriot Richardson will render a decision that will affect a little girl's life forever. (crowd chattering) - [Bailiff] All rise. Milwaukee County Circuit Court, Children's Division. Department 14 is now in session. The Honorable Judge Harriot Richardson presiding. You may be seated. - All right. I am prepared to enter findings of fact and conclusions of law. In the matter of Keith Lussier versus the Good Home Adoption Agency. But first of all, I'd like to make an aside. The Adoption Act does not, and I repeat, does not determine what is in the child's best interest. In truth, we have no way of knowing what the future holds for anyone, much less a child. What truly is in their best interest? And so we are left with a more reasonable basis for deciding whether or not an adoption should be approved. And that is, is it or was it benefiting the needs and welfare of the subject child? It is with this in mind I make the following ruling. In the case of Lussier versus the Good Home Adoption Agency, I find that the refusal of the agency to consent to this adoption was based primarily on the fact that this had become a single parent adoption due to the untimely death of Mrs. Lussier. I further find that by the time of her death, the child had become an integral member of the Lussier home and extended family. And because of this, it would have been best for her to have remained with that family. I therefore find that the agency's married couple requirement, though well-intentioned, is inapplicable in this particular case. The Good Home Adoption Agency is therefore ordered to return physical custody of the child in question to Mr. Keith Lussier with all due haste. (uplifting music) (Bob cheering) (crowd applauding) - Oh! (crowd chattering) (light music) - [Edna] Keith! - (sighing) Hi. - Welcome. Oh. Come on in, she's in the living room. She's in here. - Maybe you should go first. She might not remember me. - Oh, she'll remember you. - Oh. (gentle music) Brittany. Hi, Brit. Hi. - Oh! - Yeah. I got something for you. I got Mr. Pig! Come on Britt, come on. Let's go home. That's my girl. (Brittany crying) (whooshing) Here we go. Up, Brittany, up! I missed you so much. (Brittany babbling) Let's go home. Let's get Mr. Pig and go yeah! (chuckling) Come on. Ready to go home? You wanna go home? Let's go home. You look so beautiful, you've gotten so big. Yeah, you got so big! Got your pig, Mr. Pig.
