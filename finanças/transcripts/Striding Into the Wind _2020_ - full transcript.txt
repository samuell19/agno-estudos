What's wrong with your man？ Next time I'll ask my assistant to hold the boom. Hold it inside. Don't smoke in front of my camera. What's wrong with you, man？ We were lucky that he messed up. That was way out of focus. I'm sorry. I can't fit in there, Kun. Ok. Be steady. Shall we? Hold it. Roll sound! Wait a sec, sorry. Pick it up, help me. Take it slow. Okay, my bad, sorry. Roll Camera! Rolling. Three, two, one, action. Quiet! Sorry, please. Where's Bateer gone? Bateer? Don't know. Maybe only the manager knows. You want to find him? Okay, cut! This take is fine. Looks pretty good. Take it. What do you think? Good? Sure, yeah. Good. Hurry up. Move to the next location. Everybody move. We're late, quick! Mr. Director. Thank you, good job. What are you doing? First time, man. Man, my man. This is your first job and you dropped the pole. What the hell are you doing? Master! When I developed this character, I was taking reference of an ex of mine, who's Mongolian. Yeah. Really? What a coincidence! And, what else, this scene, in the amusement park, UFO. Once I see the roof, I get relieved. I can breathe now. Good. That's it. Okay. This way, careful, slowly. I'm good. Whose car is it? This bitch said I can get her WeChat, if I tip her a Ferrari. I heard that she's from our uni. You should play offline. See how Ming's doing. Is this your car? What? Let me help you to take off the mic. Have a seat. What's this film about? Seems about an Inner Mongolian herdswoman coming to Beijing to find her husband, who works in this amusement park. That's it? That's it. Have you read the script? Should I? I'm just recording sounds. Nobody showed me the script. Thank you. Mr. Director, can I have a copy of the script? What script? The script of this film. Yilin, did you see me directing with a script today? The film will become alive, on its own, once the camera rolls. Who needs script? Wong Kar-Wai or Hong Sang-soo? Thanks you. Here. Bro, honestly your car is too old. And the engine's worn out. I think, it's better not to waste money on it. And the seats are so ragged. Got it, you better shut it. My girlfriend's here, unless you don't want to get paid. Hey, who's he? Give me 500. What for? Come here. Come over here. Count it. Okay. Alright. I'm just saying, the emission standard will be upgraded. Soon enough, your car will be phased out. Okay, I got I got it, thank you. Sorry, but… Okay, fine. Let's go. I'll take you somewhere. I wanna go back to my dorm. What, are you mad or something? I'll pay you back. What are you doing? The door's stuck. And the car's broken down as shit. Why are you spraying perfume? It stinks. The glass sees through like crystal. Forget it. Just a couple of cars passing by. You scaredy cat. Need to go to the IEC tomorrow morning for another quick job. Can you just quit the shit? Then how can I make money? I'm saving money to take my dad to Hong Kong. They've got nothing there in Hong Kong… Or maybe I can take you to Inner Mongolia. The view is awesome. Just two of us, or maybe we can bring Tong. There won't be any speed limits. The wind will knock your eardrums. And then, when we'll get off the car, we'll sit on the grass with stars shining right above us. What do you think? Do you want to go? Kun, the car's moving. Away, stay away. Don't get hit. Do you think we can drive this car to Inner Mongolia? I think so. The dealer told me he drove it crosscountry everyday. Is it licensed? Nobody checks on the highway. But you don't even have your license. I'm working on it. Let's set out once I get it. No. What if we get caught? Last year, you said you'd go to Tibet with Tong. Two years ago, Greater Khingan Mountains. What do you want exactly? Sound guys, move your jeep away now. It's in the frame. How about now? Can't you move any farther? Move back, a bit more. Chubby, you can hold the pole here. That's the redline, got it? Just remember, dare you trespass into my frame, I'll snap your pole. You hear me? What about now? For God's sake, a bit farther, I can still feel it. You know. Man, what do you mean that you can feel it? I mean, what if I pan the camera? Then the car will get into the frame again. However, I hope you can act out that that feeling, that you see the horses in your heart. Even if you see no horse here at all, but, you can feel it more than seeing it. Alright? Feel it yourself. Ming, I need to pin on the mic. Ok, ok. Yilin, please pin on this mic. Let me do it. Think about what I just said. No horses. Ming, if you don't show to the audience, how can they know that the horses are dead? Wong Kar-Wai focused on a glass to portray a couple quarrelling, instead of showing their faces. Why? Artistic reality, keeps distance from daily reality. Thus… But it's important for Tuya. Excuse me for a second. Come. Your job here is to take care of your guy. That chubby boy is eating double, a combo bento! We're about to roll camera and he's gone. Maybe you should check if he's eating triple lunch bento. Go. That's why I cast you. Because I think a good actress will show to the audience through her eyes. Look at me, look at my eyes, to show the bleakness of the grassland. Cut! Wrap! What do you think? Feng, it's awesome. Did you do it on purpose? For sure. You kept the distance between the character and the camera… Isn't it Hou Hsiao-hsien's style? All credit goes to you, Mr. Director. Right? Teamwork, freaking awesome. Let me record ambience sound, sir. Good. Wrap up and pack up. Thanks, everyone. Let's pack. What's ambience sound? Shout out loud. What's ambience sound? I mean to let them be quiet! QUIET! Record ambience sound! We need to record ambience sound. Please be quiet, thanks. Go there. Sorry guys, please keep quiet. Easy, steady, slowly. Thanks for your cooperation. Grassland ambience sound, take one… Thanks. Again. Cut! Excuse me, stop talking, thanks for your cooperation. Thanks, okay. Grassland ambience sound, take two… Slow, slower. Slower, told you. Tong, hold this. Give me the boom pole. What? Get off, pull him off. That's it? Do you know how much I paid his medical bill? That's all I got now. I didn't charge you the car, or the gas. You can't deduct it from my salary. Kun, do you know that you put me in an awkward situation? You know how much I owe Feng this time… Then you owe me quite a lot too. I didn't charge you either. Haven't I just paid you 500? Well, my bro, I believe, this is a pretty good chance to learn things. Isn't it good? I'll get you paid jobs later. When exactly you reckon? Next time. Okay? Next time. Ming, do you know if anyone else's shooting thesis film? I met a guy days ago, who's Mongolian too. He wants to be a singer. Go and check his company. He might offer you a job for fast buck. Alright? Not too different from recording on set. How about this one? Yeah, I can still see. Now? Pure black, man. Why tint it so dark? Will tell you when you play offline. Man, your car's coughing out smoke. Slowly, slowly. Take a look for me. Go forward a bit. Zhi. Dad. You're early! Haven't seen you for ages. Miss me? Every day. Of course. Is it their car? The exhaust smoke is heavy. It isn't running right today, but it used to be fine. What's the matter? You don't know either. I don't. Zhi, Fine. Look, three minutes late. Mr. Cheng, I'm sorry. Nice to meet you. Hi, Mr. Cheng. My name is Tong Shaojie. And he's Kun. This is Tong Shaojie, my schoolmate. Okay, let's get in. The postgraduates we hired no longer have any advantages. Only PhDs are qualified to housing allocation. Exactly. I was thinking about having a master degree, and, teach at our university. My mom is a teacher, so my parents hope that I can be a teacher too. Teachers are decently paid. Zhi told me that you're always on the go in university. Not always. I'm just doing something that I like. Pretty good. Not bad. However, you can't always ride on roller coaster. Better settle down. Right? Yes. Oh, do you have your laptop with you, Kun? No. Days ago, I noticed some civil service job vacancies. Maybe you'd like to check it out. One recruitment notice was posted by the Recordist Association. It's pretty good, perfect for you. As long as you can work hard, there will be plenty opportunities. Of course. Maybe, we can have a look with my laptop. Come on. This way. Next page, the next one. Keep going. Mr Cheng, actually I've looked up these jobs before. How about this? Let me think when I go back. If I still want to sign up, I'll do it then. There is no need to bother you. No, no no. Look, here. It says, today is the deadline. If I were you, I'd sign up right here, right now. The internet speed in this hotel is amazing. Come on. What's your name again? Zuo, Zuo Kun. Zuo Kun, Kun. K-U-N. Let's see. Ignite. Hit the gas pedal. Stop. I haven't seen such a crappy car in years. It's blowing black smoke. Can it still be fixed? Excuse me, is this Moonriver Construction Materials Ltd.? Wait a minute. I pray to God, for a pair of wings. Pretty good this time, High$ea, One more time, just in case. Someday I will fly to the moon. I will reach the top of the moon, and sing a song to the planet we call home. I'm gonna make every terran hear my blues, they'll know, my love is true… I'm gonna make every terran hear my blues, and they'll know… Sit here. Okay. Have a seat. Take a look at my album series. Galaxy Trilogy. The first album is called Apollo. Second album, Terrans. The song you just heard is the demo of its theme song. And the third, Moon River. Each album contains 100 songs, that is to say, the lyrics are 100 poems. Do you know Sanlitun, the liveliest area in Beijing? All of the window screens there were installed by my company. Construction earns me money, music makes me happy. High$ea, the Music Weekly journalists are here. Oh, right. They can hear my music first. Learn a little bit about my style. Alright. Bro, here's the deal, 1,500 yuan a week, plus performance bonus. Cool? Any other requirements? Go and take two boxes of my CDs. Do a good promotion at your university. You want to hear this? Bro. Wanna hear Terrans? It's pretty good. Terrans. Bro, this CD contains 100 songs, 100 poems. Give a try? Let me check. Is it that bad? Stop moving. Stop, stop, stop. Hey, do you want some CDs? How about this? Here, Terrans 10 bucks each. It cost us 30 to make it! We got something to do today, so 10 yuan each, just for you. What the fuck is that? Wandering Earth 2? Our boss worked really hard on this. This collection of 100 songs and 100 poems is really awesome! Welcome. Good evening. This way, please. Excuse me, what's this event? Do you have invitation letter? Fine. I'll park myself. Where's the parking lot? Excuse me, sir. You can't park here without an invitation letter. I'm here to find my friend. Which one? I said, my friend. Without invitation letter, you are not allowed to get in. I'm here to find my girlfriend. Security! Do I need invitation letter to see my girlfriend? What's wrong? My girlfriend is here. Excuse me. What's wrong? I'm sorry, apologies. Come over. Excuse us. So sorry. What are you doing here? What do you mean? Why are you here? I got a job. I thought you might want to know. Can't you see I'm busy? Can't you wait? Go home now. Sorry for all these. I'm so sorry. We can calculate watts later. How about install eight loudspeakers this time? Well, the thing is that my monthly KPI… Hey, forget about your KPI, not a big deal. I just don't know if my studio is big enough or not. For your upcoming concerts, we should install the line array loudspeaker system. Line array is cool. Perfect for my voice. Must be ground shaking. Love your idea. So what would you rather? Cash or card? Either way. You want to take a leak or what? Then cash! Okay? Sure. Just go piss. Okay, I'll be back. I need more equipment to better present my voice. High$ea. Yea. What's the price he offered? 30000 Way too expensive, and it's not for studio recording. You don't get it. Well, my theory is to bite every bait, because it won't taste the same. No use explaining, you just won't get it. How's it going with the albums? Sold out. All sold out? Yes. Oh my, my brother. Told you, college students must be loving it! Come over here, follow me. Come in, bro. I got more. Take two more boxes, and sell them out. But High$ea, to be honest, I've been to all universities in Beijing. There's nowhere else I can go. Nobody's gonna buy two more boxes. My brother, do me a favor. Here's the push money for your first sale pack. Think outside the box and sell two more boxes. Here, take them. High$ea. Here, take. Here we go! Check this! What if we recorded all these albums? Then what about High$ea? I'm gonna quit. If you quit then we aren't getting money. How much more do we need for refitting your car? Man, is this your home or not? Hello, sir. Hi, Kun. …the Summertime Summary and Rewarding Meeting of our detention center… Sir, have you seen my dad? …summarizing the work of the second quarter of this year... Dad. …and rewarding Outstanding Officers… Dad! Hi, Mr. Zuo. What you've been up to? You're so skinny. I'm at school, taking lessons. You installed a new door? Several houses in our neighborhood were robbed. And the antitheft door manufacturer was having discount sales. So your mom decided to install one. But why didn't you tell me? Shouldn't be you telling me things? Your school contacted me. Keep the key well. And I paid your fees. I haven't told your mom. And you should stop causing her troubles. Who else charges her son rent for summer vacation? That's because you refused, when she asked you to learn French horn. She will give it to your cousin Shanshan. Your aunt's considering sending her to learn French horn. Can we sell it? If I were still in high school, I'd hate this Zhang Baoxia so much. How come that she's compiled so many exercise books? Man, is this you? Playing a little French horn? Wow! Come in, everybody. Who is it? My mom. Ms. Baoxia? My mom. If you get these questions correctly answered, you'd have no problem with the second mock exam. But don't share the exam papers with anyone else. You got it? Here, he's coming. Here you are. Is this authentic? You little bastard are stupid and blind. Ten times compensation if it's not. Take it or leave it. Ok, I'll take one copy. Then copy and share? Then 12 copies. I'll WeChat pay you. Hi man, do you have Chinese exam papers? Why do you guys even need to cheat on Chinese? How about next month? Focus on this exam first. We'll see how it goes next month. Okay. Say, who should we thank for getting us headlights? Well done, my dear students! I think first of all, we should thank Zhang Baoxia. Screw you! To my sis Baoxia. Shit, can't see anything. Faster, go faster. Knock it off! Knock it off! Turn it off! Keep it off! Don't you think this is what we'd feel after death? I mean, eternal darkness, not like this. It's endless. Shit, that's scary. Now we'll learn how to foley the sound of horse hoofs. I'll start slow. You got it? Tip the camgirl a Ferrari. Click, Ferrari. I'm flat broke! Left, right, or right left. You decide. It's on me. Don't you want her WeChat? Tip her. Send her Ferrari! I bet you two know how to do it? Come on. I'm talking to you, Zuo Kun. Come here. Show us your trick. Please, Master Zuo. Can I have a look of your book? Of course. Here, take it. Prof, it looks like a wild horse, not horseshoed, galloping on the grassland. My delivery guy's here. When do you think my girlfriend will come to pick? If I were you, I'd ask her in person why she stopped her show. No need. I just want to see that bitch. See how she suffers without me. Target shows up, at ten' o clock. Let's go now. Go, go. Let's go. Why? Too much for me. I quit, man. Wanna give it a go or not? Gonna drive back, if you wuss out. My dad can't take the days off for Hong Kong with me. What's so fun about Disney? Can't you find a merrygoround anywhere else? I've made enough money. We can go. My treat. I'm not saying that I won't go. You promised me last year. Fine, I'll leave you alone. Zhi? You can play nunchakus? I like your laughter, sounds sweet. Can you laugh one more time? Please give him another chance. He's got something really important today. I made it clear at the beginning of this semester, whoever misses 3 times, fails. Don't even bother to take the exam. Tear em up, all of them. High$ea actually looks pretty cool on this poster. High$ea, 100 new songs, 100 poems. Real poet. He's here. Hi, Professor Guo. Why didn't you go to the fire drill? Yup, I just didn't. That's because I wanted to talk to you in private. Why? Hold it for me. Can I give up the 30 attendance points, and take the exam? I don't want to retake the course. Then show up in my class. I already said that at the beginning. Yes, yes you did. But, just let me take the exam please! I knew almost everything you've taught. I have nothing to say to you. Complain to the principal if you like. Okay? I didn't want to complain. I was trying to talk to you. I'm not gonna… That's it. I'm busy. Okay. Okay. See you, Professor Guo. Thank you, Professor Guo. Your car? Yes. You have license? Okay. Drive slowly. Okay. You too. See you, Professor Guo. Get down, get down. Did he see? Bro, the sound track is so clean. At least let me hear something. You literally didn't record any damn sound. I've recorded almost everything. This is the only missing part. I got ambience sound. Let me import the track. Ming, wait, no worries. Let me find breeze sound from the effect library. Okay? Seriously? You call it breeze? Or a typhoon? Ming, shall we go to Inner Mongolia for reshoot? My professor didn't believe that I grew up in Inner Mongolia. Yeah, we may have to go to Inner Mongolia for real. Haven't been back for years. Excuse us, sorry. Excuse us. Sorry, excuse us. Excuse me. This way. Pay attention to your facial expression. Smile. …to witness this blessed moment. Let's count down. Three, two, one. The ribbon-cutting ceremony begins. Great! Alright, thank all the leaders for your presence. Thank you. Thanks for your support. Please go to the VIP room for a rest. There are two sessions of today's ceremony. After the ribbon-cutting, you can go inside for wine tasting. You will not only taste Innerself, but also have chance to win lucky draw. Good luck everyone. You two, come with me. What's the matter? Why didn't you smile? Can you smile? Show me. When are you finishing? Can we talk? We need to go to Inner Mongolia. Come on, Master Yu is here. The wine we tasted just now is brewed by Innerself Chateau for our honorable consumers. It says if you are with true friends, you won't get drunk even after a thousand cups. Innerself is pleased and honered to have Master Yu, the famous calligrapher, Round of applause for him. As we can see, one end of it is brush. And the other end is his weapon. Bravo! What's the problem about it？ Bravo! Bravo! Hello. Hello. Please get off, your cooperation is appreciated. Why did you run away? I didn't. I thought that lane was jammed. Exhale deeply. Come over. Move your car. Get off. What did you drink? Wine. Film school? Looking for inspiration? No, I got it from my friend and drank accidentally. I don't care who gave you the wine. DUI is illegal. Got it? Since this is your first time, a 1,500 yuan fine and suspension of your license. Can I have another chance? What? Here's your penalty notice. Don't forget to pay the fine. Can I leave then? Go. How about your car? Can I drive? You tell me. Find a friend or hire someone. Thank you, sir. Bro, have you got a driver? Are you for hire? I have another proposal. I'll drive for a while, and later you take over. 200. But what if I get caught again? Don't worry. I know all the check spots better than those officers. That's it. You can take over from here. Drive slowly. Can we call the police? The mechanic has told you the car is going to be scraped next year. If you apply now, we can get some money. What do you say? I met a friend at an event, whose husband works at the DMV. I've asked her, she said he can help with the procedures. You got quite a lot of friends. My friends take life seriously. Are you going or not? I can book time for you. I don't give a shit about saving a few grands. Then don't borrow money from me. I'll pay you back. And this car has nothing to do with you. Well, do I have anything to do with you? Maybe that's it for us. Take your stuff. I've moved on to another brand ages ago. Thanks. You need anything else? Nah it's fine. I'll let you know next time. What ya doing? A gift for you. You're such a good driver and you deserve a license. Since we're going to Inner Mongolia, I got someone for urgent service. How much do I owe you? It's all good man, don't worry about it. Where did you get the money? I changed an old school phone to play the Snake. Like it? I don't believe there's no place for justice. Careful, ma'am. The society will be ruined by those deceitful teachers. This way. Easy. Teacher Zhang. Teacher Zhang. Teacher Zhang. Open the door! How dare you leak the exam questions and then hide?! You are a scumbag! Too despicable to be a teacher. It's empty. You want to keep it? Please let me, I'll carry it. I used to help my ex with hers, and waited her when she went to salon. Just like burnishing beads, careful, this buffs up your mind. I named her Beady-beauty Zhuzhu. Watch out. Well, you know, girls with repeated-syllable names are really cute. The crew has already set off. Sorry for any inconvenience. Bear it for a while. Won't take long. Let me open it for you. Okay. Can I drive all the way to Inner Mongolia? This is our sound recorder and his assistant. We've met. I'll put your French horn at the back. No, give it to me. I'll hold it. You want to hold it all the way to Inner Mongolia? Safe and secured. Slow and steady. What? My cigarette. Pull over. We won't go veggie. I've arranged Sheep Banquet for you. Really? What are we getting? It's a lamb and mutton feast. You got to try the tasty ewe, I mean ewe, not you. How about mutton entrails soup? That's boring, man. Had a nap? Kun, your mom is calling. Do you still want to take it? Not now. Kebab? Haven't you had enough in Beijing? Shredded lamb? Sure, it's Sheep Banquet. Hurry up, go go, gear up! Oh no, cops! Turn right, right here, I see cops! Stop, stop! Ehh, fake cops. Hi, Chief. Almost there. We got some little problems. Don't wait for us, please start. Great, excellent. What should we do? Yilin, I think you should get off the car, to reduce some weight. Put on my shirt. It'll keep you warm. I'll get off. Okay, then you stay. Alright, push, Tong. Stop, stop. Here comes the tow truck. When will she finish work? 9.(9:00) By nine. Where should we go after work? 9,8 (bar). Okay, to the bar. And then what? Memory cleared. Oh, totally dead drunk. Then where should we go? (+ （home). Go home. How about repeat clicking your name, like 1,1,1 (Yi Yi Yi) Ming. The bill. Wait a minute. 1,100, in total. How can it be so expensive? Let me show you. Reset. Lower control arm, 500 yuan. 5,0,0,+ Headlights, 300. 3,0,0,+ Bumper, 300. 3,0,0=1,1,0,0 Mom, why didn't you tell me? Tell Zhang Jiarui, dares him to do it again, I won't let him see Yangyang next month. Where's the 500 I gave you? We paid the gas. I'm done. No way, we're just getting started. Your bowl is empty. Refill it. Have more, cheers. Keep on drinking. Here, a toast, to everyone. Welcome again. We got lamb and wine. Feel at home and enjoy the banquet. Brilliant! Thank you, Chief! You're welcome. Here. My pleasure. Ming, don't know if you can do me, well, a small favor or not? Please tell me. Well, this Happy Ger Resort is a new project. Maybe I can get a copy of the film you're making tomorrow? This favor is too small compared to your generosity. Once I have the copy, I'll play it as a promo video. Feng, the Chief asked us to take more scenic shots for his promo video! Sure, no problem. Welcome, welcome. Thank you, thank you. Right, this is how we welcome friends. Here. Thanks, Chief. We rely on you to help us with our promo video. No problem. I've brought the album as a little thank-you gift. How about that? Here you are, Terrans. Take one. It's a good album. Here, take this one. One for you. Cheers! Buttoms up! Hi, Chief. This is my bro's album, called the Terrans. Terrans? 100 songs, 100 poems. That's a lot, excellent. Check it out. A little present for you. Ming, one for you. I'm good, take it away. Thank you, young man. My pleasure. Look, Yilin. Chief, the bonfire is ready. Great! Come on. Now everyone, here's for the next show… Come with me, put it on. Let's go outside. Cool. I've invited the best dancers to teach you how to dance. Come on. Come on. Come. Take it away. Here, just take it. Move your body. Hello, mom. I'm on set, busy now. Oh, hi, Ms. Zhang. Hold on a second, please. Your mom is on the phone. Feng, let me try it. One more time. One more? You do it like our Mongolian totems. Do it again. Go find someone else. Leave us alone for a sec. Feng, it cost us a lot to finally be here. Trust me this time. Tomorrow morning, before sunrise, we must capture the graveyard of all gods, the despair of the grassland. Hold it back, we must hold it back. Otherwise I always feel like filming transition scenes. Got it, I know you… You trust my aesthetic taste, don't you? Sure, definitely. I'm in too. Easy, easy. We have enough albums for everyone. Here. Ming, just take one. Take one, take one. Take one. Last ones. Who want the last ones? Close your eyes. Okay, good. Right? Yes, good. Correct? I'll leave you guys alone. Ming, fire is not allowed on the grassland now. Therefore, I replaced it with lights. Great! It looks authentic. Do you have anything extra special? More exotic? This isn't? It's very ethnic minoirtyish. You know, maybe it's not 100% nomadic style, but it shows the spirit of grasslanders to the full extent! What do you think? More exotically unconventional. Exotically unconventional? Ming, I thought you were a gentleman that holds back. Let's talk inside the ger. Whatever you like, just let me know. Okay? Come in, watch your head. Stop the car. What are you looking for? Awake now? They've started preparing over there. See you there. Feng, the anesthetic can't last long. Those horses might wake up soon. Kun, we're gonna start shooting. Alright, let's not wait. Come on. We'll start. Quick! Get ready, everyone. Okay, everybody get ready. Yilin. Yes? Could you please, stand here, right here. Put the flecky board back. Farther, yes. Rolling? Three, two, one, action. Okay, cut! The horses were waking. Don't worry, they were out of frame. Out of frame? Yes. Did it look okay? Yes, should be fine. Alright, pretty good. Nice, everything's good. Alright people, stay in position. And camera, follow me, hurry up! Camera team… Come, quick, follow me. We'll do master shots. Camera, here. Hong Sang-soo... This is so Hong Sang-soo-ish. Genius. You too. That's a wrap. That's a wrap? It's a wrap guys, good job! Finally, finally. Thanks, everyone. Let's take a photo. Feng, let's take a photo. Okay, a photo, everybody come. Quick. Who's got a phone? Come for a photo. Thank you. Don't forget to pack up. Pack your stuffs. Hurry up. Ming, can I have a word with you? Well, I mean, you shouldn't just pay me for one day. It took us an extra day on the road. So, it should be two days. Nonono, how many days for shooting? One day for shooting. I'm paying you for shooting days. But it took me two days. Are you an actress or not? How do you make money as an actress? By shooting films, correct? But… You wasted my time. It took all of us time to drive here. Then the car broke down and took us one more day. Why are they arguing about? Ming paid her. She said it should be two days, as it also took her one day to come here. But Ming told her that we should pay her, they got here late because of us. This is not grasslandish spirit at all. We have to go to the real grassland. Cops…how come? Should we stop? We can't stop! Go rush over it! Step on the gas! Step on it! Be quiet. Why did you turn this way? Go that way! They can't drive fast on this rough road. Tong, check for me if they're still chasing. It's way too easy to chase. They are after us. They flank. They're coming! We're screwed, no way to escape this time. Slow down. What now? The car wouldn't start. Totally dead. Where's the fake license I bought you? I have my driver's license with me. Sit here, I mean crouch on the seat and let's swap. Let me…I can… Move aside, man. Make way! Zuo Kun, we just confirmed that your driver's license was suspended five days ago in Beijing. According to the Law of the People's Republic of China on Road Traffic Safety, you're fined 2,000 yuan and will be put into administrative detention for 10 days. Come with us. What are you doing now? My BWC is recording. Don't make more mistakes. Kun, go with us. You stay for further investigation. Get in the car. This way. Sir, let me talk to him for one second. Be quick. I bet we won't see this car again. Go check and get out anything important. Hi. Bro, do you have tomorrow's exam paper? Hello? Sit still. Hey, Zuo. Hi, Ma. Have a seat. Didn't know he's your son. I'm really sorry, Zuo, but I can't move him to single cell. I know, we have to follow the rules. He's not a boy anymore. Then act like a real man! You know, find something you love, and just go for it. Don't waste time, or time will waste you. Eventually it's all up to him, but you should guide him to the right path. I'll take the blame and will not tolerate ignorance anymore. Right, do you remember Peng's boy? A talented kid who failed due to bad parenting. Kun, did you hear what Uncle Ma said? Give us a minute, we'll have a word. He used to be a good boy. However, since he went to boarding school... Right, exactly. It's a real reminder for us. I'll keep an eye on him. Movement One. Parting the wild horse's mane. You should talk more. Sure. I'll tell him where to draw the line this time. Ending posture. Shift. Shift. "Gratitude" Salute! Higher, up! Fine, next group. Ready, three, two, one, go. Towards the mouth, my mouth. Hey, you almost hit the back of my head. Up, higher. Too close. One, two, three, happy graduation! Excuse me, could you pick the cap for me please? Thank you. Can I borrow it? Which school do you study in? I'll send it back to you. School of Cinematography. Okay, just a minute. I'll send it back later. Sure. Come over here. Give me your phone. What do you think? Any problem? Follow me, look. Here, and here. Check inside. Look. What happened? I was trying to get High$ea's CD out. Where are you selling it to? To Inner Mongolia. The herdsmen are gonna drive it to shepherd sheep. Cool, give me 4,000 and it's yours. Okay, but, bro, I've checked the system and you still have quite dozens of unpaid penalty points. According to the current regulations, the points might cost 5,000 yuan. What do you mean? I'm selling you for 4,000, are you saying I should pay you another 1,000? Well, I didn't expect the unpaid penalty points. Alright, how about this, say, I give you 500? Deal? You made a lot of money by repairing our car. 4,000 yuan is fairly cheap. And you're taking it for 500? I mean, seriously? Just let him take it. Okay. You sure you can drive it to Inner Mongolia? Inner Mongolia? Yeah should be fine. But I need to get rid of the dark window paper. Look. Can't see anything at night. Man, could you close the trunk lid for me? Thank you. Thanks. hit melody. A collection of 100 songs and 100 poems, Terrans is the second one of his series. A mix of Pop and Electro, it hits right notes with young people… Hey, wait, go back. Back. Now let's check out this hundred-million-hit title song Terrans. I love you, I truly love you, but you can't get it. You take it for granted. I love you, I truly love you, but you don't trust me. You stay in the shadow of doubt. I love you, I truly love you, forever love you. But I lost you, forever. I pray to God, for a pair of wings. Someday I will fly to the moon. I will reach the top of the moon. I feel lost and empty, as the jeep took all of my emotions away. Senior year is like a mirrior, showing who I really am. Those past mistakes and pains that I suffered, are sucking the life out of me. Shall we begin again, to seize the day, choose our own way, and find ourselves? Are you in?
