This film was found incomplete in the archives of the Nederlands Filmmuseum. In the missing first act, the poor Maxon family takes care of the rich Clarissa Sedgewick, after she nearly died in a shipwreck. SHOULD A WOMAN TELL? Second Act. "It isn't serious... the heavy emotions have upset her... all she needs is rest!" "Doctor! The dog is very sick too!" Eight days later. At the ocean's shore, now resting in peaceful silence. Again, Gloria Maxon and Albert Tuley spend some delightful hours together. "It's such a shame you can't continue your studies, Albert... I believe you could have become a great artist!" "Every year, in the most beautiful season, I meet a famous sculptor, of whom I have learned a great deal, and he even promised to take an interest in me in the future." "Once my work has acquired me fame, will then my dearest dream come true?" "Sweet child, I just wrote my cousin in Boston, asking him to take me home!" "I'm wondering about what I could do for you, Gloria! You have been so good and sweet for me the past eight days, that I have really started loving you." "Would you want to join me? I will treat you like my own child... I will raise and educate you, and provide your entire future!" "What about you, M?dor! How would you like Gloria becoming your new mistress?" "Promise me, you will love her... and that you will never be jealous!" A week later. The departure. Miss Sedgewick's cousin, Morton, is a happy mortal, blessed with wealth, allowing him to act and say whatever he wants to. Morton Sedgewick... Played by JACK GILBERT Third Act. Albert, aware of Gloria's departure, convinced his acquainted sculptor to invite him to New York. "What?! You are leaving as well?" "Yes! My tutor accepts to host me; I will earnestly devout myself to my lessons, and hopefully, one day, I will succeed in making you proud!" "Where is Gloria?" "Gloria is paying a last visit to a place at the shore, which means a lot to her." "Once your daughter's had her rest, she will surely find a rich marriage. She won't have to suffer the same misery I did, your Gloria!" A year later. At the end of the holiday, Miss Sedgewick has a grand party, after which Gloria returns to boarding school. "I simply can't believe, this is our last evening together, and the end of our friendship." That same evening in the little town of Hull. In three days my holiday will end, and I will return to college. Miss Sedgewick is so very sweet and good for me, that I don't even know how to respond to this. I was equally touched by the kindness she showed you following father's death. Merely a single part of the kind letter interested the hateful woman. Morton Sedgewick's interest in me keeps growing, and my happiness would be even more complete, if you and the little ones were here. "Our miserable lives will soon be over, for your sister will marry a rich man. Of that, I'm dead certain! "Mother?" "We have nothing but dry bread for dinner!" "When you are gone, I will feel so very lonely!" "If we would benefit from this delightful evening with a last ride on the lake?" "Dear Lord, send your blessing to Gloria, whom we have to be thankful, for freeing us from our troubles." Fourth Act. Convinced that she is loved, Gloria finds great joy in the little boat trip, but an irrational fear takes hold of her once they stop at the shore side villa. Yet still, she is unaware of life's hard and cruel reality. Like a lamb, unable to see the dangers when leaving it's shepherd's care... Gloria didn't see the danger, until it overpowered her. After the grave assault she fell victim to, Gloria searched the protection of her elderly home. "What happened? Why did you come here?" The foul woman had understood the terrible truth. But despite her cruel nature, she urged the ill-fated girl to explain everything. "And didn't you see the trap he set up?" "Ungrateful wench! How dare you blame me for this?" "Mother! Who has ever warned me of life's cruelties? You never cared for me... I was ignorant of the all the dangers that could have surrounded me, but I was unprotected and powerless, because I knew nothing!" Two years later. Albert Tuley receives the grand Medal of Honour at the exposition in New York. "My dear friend, I'm overjoyed to inform you of the government's decision to purchase your work for the National Gallery!" "My boy! Your old master is proud of you!" Fifth Act. During the hard labour, imposed by her stepmother, Gloria remembers him, who once sincerely loved her. "Our best wishes, Albert! We have heard of your great success!" The poor, tender and wounded Gloria thinks of Albert, yet her soul is hurt by doubt. Does she still have the right to love someone? "Why do you keep running from me, Gloria?" "Everything I achieved, I did for you... It's due to my love for you, I succeeded. Do you want to be my wife?" This kiss reminded her soul of the kiss with that other person, who so cruelly destroyed her life. When, however, it is a man's right, not to take his past life with him should a woman then keep her misfortune a secret, or... should she tell? Confident of her sincerity, and trusting in Albert's great love for her, Gloria decides to confess the truth. ...So, my dear Albert, I have now told you the whole truth. If your heart is able to forgive me, then as a sign, return the rose, which will be delivered to you with this letter. Your Gloria "Didn't I advise you not to speak of your past?" "I have to be honest towards the man who would want to marry me... and I couldn't belong to him, if I would keep this secret to myself!" "You are mad! Albert will never marry you, now that he knows everything!" The rose brings tidings. "The rose told me her secret, and I come to thank you for your great love for me." Sixth Act. The end of a beautiful day. "Do you want to write in the letter in which I tell my friends of our luck?" "This is the first time I see your handwriting, my love!" "What did you say? So you didn't receive the letter, which I, accompanied by the rose, left in your room?" Her tortured soul makes the sacrifice, for the great love she feels for him, and reveals the whole truth. "When you came to me saying 'Thanks for loving me', I was convinced you read it!" "Gloria! Tell me, it's a lie... Tell me, you are just testing me!" "Albert, I was but a child! I was unaware of the evil and the grave dangers... Doesn't my confession prove my innocence? Would I have spoken if I had been guilty?" "No, you will not leave! The sorrow of your tears won't replace the joy of kissing you... Stay!" "I will make sure you won't lack anything... It would stain the purity of my love, because nothing can prove me your innocence!" One year later, at Pueble. Miss Sedgewick, having heard why the young girl left so suddenly, meanwhile has forced her cousin to marry Gloria, who was finally persuaded with the deceitful news of Albert's death. Despite his marriage, Morton keeps to his life of extravagance and adultery. My dear child, Since your marriage with Morton, Miss Sedgewick does everything to make us happy. So she has kept her vow to take care of us, if you would become her cousin. "Ha! Truly a clever agreement, you and your mother came up with!" Coincidence brought Albert to Pueble, where he sought to forgot his grief. Face to face. "I was told you were dead!... And to free my family of poverty, I have sacrificed myself by marrying the man who once destroyed my life!" "Drunkenness caused this accident... This drunk made a scene barely an hour ago!" ...and their hearts, strengthened by their many trials, felt grief nor sorrow, now that he was folly convinced of her pure innocence.
