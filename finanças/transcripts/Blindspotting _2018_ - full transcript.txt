Come on, come on, come on! Give him the right. Right. Whop on his head. Just like that. All right, well, little Thug Life right here is about to be late to school again. Only 'cause you're not sending him to the preschool down the street like I told you to, he'd have been there already. Yeah, well, where he needs to go is Centro Vida preschool in Berkeley. Centro Vida preschool is $200 more a fucking week. Are you kidding me? Well, that's because it's the only bilingual preschool that I can get to on the train. Why he need to be bilingual? - He already biracial. - Oh, my God, come on. That's how you do it! Just use all that mouthpiece to get us some fancy preschool money. Okay? - Fine. - That's it. It's all right. We're fine. - Ow! - But I gotta talk to you about something serious. - What? - Why my hands are so cold this morning. I can't go to work with these cold hands. I'ma need to warm them up on that ass of yours just for a second. Oh, my God. But your hands are so cold! Just for a second. - You are ridiculous. - Right there. I know. I know. I know. - You feel better? - It's so nice. - What am I supposed to do? It's just... - I bet. I bet it is so nice. - It's a privilege. - 'Cause it's nice. I gotta go. I love you. Love you too. Whoo! S, you cheated. - Hey, hey, hey. - What's up, Collin? What's up, Miles? After a pursuit in West Oakland last night, a dramatic standoff with police left one suspect dead. This the shit you saw? He was evading arrest by fleeing down Adeline Street towards West Grand... - You see this cop? - Yeah, I saw him. ...police officers fired four shots, killing the man. Why the fuck is he wearing his hat all low? Why would you take a picture like that? - This cop see you? - Yeah. Hey, bro, let me get that square. What, then you just left? I mean, it was after 11:00. What I'm supposed to do? - James always be talking that shit. - But you're a witness. You're not gonna leave like a statement or some shit? Oh, yeah. "Hello, police? "I'd like to report a murder you did. "I was out after curfew. Yeah, I'm a convicted felon." - All right. - "Back to jail? "Yeah, tomorrow works for me. What time? "Fo sho. Mmm-hmm. "Yup. Okay." Bro, what the fuck is this green juice shit doing up in here? It's good for you. - How much? - $10. - What? - What? What is this, the blood of fucking Jesus? The fuck is in it that it cost $10? - Let me get one. - I'm sorry, what? All right, we are all set. Thank you so much for choosing Commander. Namaste, Val. Your aura is looking very transcendent this morning. Did you finally purge yourself of your superiority complex or... No, you're still... Still working on it? Okay. - Oh, is that a green juice? - Is it? Oh. Oh, yeah. I guess it is. You know, it's just part of my regimen these days. A little green juice, a little, what's that class you be taking? - SoulCycle. - SoulCycle. Yeah, a little... My soul is so... Shit. Ah... It's healthy. I am just glad you're taking care of yourself. Most definitely. Um... Collin was involved in a shootout - last night with the police. - What? I wasn't... That's not true. That's not what happened. - He's not... - Who were you out... - No, Miles... Miles! - Very exciting. People died. - Who were you out with? - He's just fucking with you, babe. Uh, sorry, Val. Front desk girl. - Person. Front desk, front desk person. - Get going. - I'm going now. - Thank you for calling Commander, where we strive for excellence in relocations... Fuck Val! Fuck Val. She disloyal, she uppity, and she permanently in downward bitch pose. That ain't my fault. Motherfucker, you're bugging. That's his ex-girl. Yorkie, stop saying bugging. You live on the West Coast now. You're a Californian. Get with the fucking program. Hey, Miles. You bugging. Shut the fuck up, Tel! Shut the fuck up! Hey, she got this nigga a job, and she lets you guys both drive the truck home. - Come on, get out this boy's head. - Thank you, Tel. She gotta let us drive the truck to and from work. That's how we get to and from work, man. She's... I'm not saying she's not smart. She plenty smart. I'm just saying it's a shame she only uses that intelligence toward being a higher caliber of bitch. - That's all I'm saying. - You got to simmer. Simmer, man. Hey, he only defending her 'cause he like that vegan Kwik Way pussy that he giving her. That's the whole shit. - Oh! - That's too far. That's too far. You don't get to eat no pussy 'cause that rusty-ass grill in your mouth. Oh! Oh, shit, tall-ass bike, big-ass beard. Oh, gentrification on a whole other level. Who are these people? Okay, there's Leon. Cynthia. Marvin. Where's Vivian? Such an evasive little firecracker. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't have Santiago and Dante facing each other. They... They do not get along. Please. My work looks to make people fall in love. So I love trees? That's from my last exhibit. I superimposed photographs of oak trees over neighborhoods where they used to grow, to remind people that they used to be everywhere. Now they're just on the damn street signs. Oh, boys, they're chopping us down. These people were all forced out for the new Oakland. Which is why faces. Eyes. To stare is to see. Come on. Come here for a minute. Just stare at each other for a moment. Oh, no, man, we're close enough. We got kinda like a Calvin and Hobbes thing going on. This isn't sexual. See, but now it is, 'cause how you said that. This is about finding the soul. - I know. Okay. All right. - All right. Okay. All right. Okay. - Look. - Fuck, your eyes match your jumpsuit. - Don't talk about the emeralds. - Look deep. Connect. Understand. Fucking, don't fucking do it! Oh, look, Patrick, you a swell motherfucker, man, and I dig everything about you, except that shit right there. I'm sorry. Yes, I got it already. Hey, man, you gonna have to move your car, bruh. We got to get out. Bruh, you gotta move, boy! Let's go! Look at this fucking transplant. What's he doing? - Hey, Mom. - Move your shit, bruh! Oh, you're not gonna listen? You don't hear me? Yeah, that is Miles. Yeah. He's just ignoring me. - He said hi. - Move, bruh! Yo, I think we could be there in like... - Fifteen minutes. - Are you kidding me right now? Hey! Hey! Do you hear the fucking ringing sound? - Move your shit! Son of a... - Mom, I gotta go. Who is this little homie? Me think he my stepbrother. Why is he drinking out of your dinosaur mug you made in fifth grade? Mugasaurus. You just gonna let him drink out your mug like that? You just gonna let him do that, Collin? Mom! Mom! I'm in the bathroom, sir! What? My... You... That's my... This is my room! - You gave him my room? - I know. Mom! He is living in my room? This is why I told you to come over so we could talk about what your, - you know, long-term plan is. - Ma! I am moving home in two days! You really couldn't find an apartment? The whole damn city got a "For Rent" sign on it. "Have you ever been convicted of a felony? "If so, what is the nature of your crime?" - Well, whose fault is that? - Damn. Well, I just assumed you'd only be here for a little bit. - And eventually you and Val... - Mom. Mom. She came by a couple of days ago. We are not together right now. - Okay. Okay. - Okay. Okay. Well, Jimmy and all my drums are in guest room A now. - Yeah, I saw that. - Clear the rest of Shanai's stuff off her old bed and you can have that room for a bit. But that is not your room. That is my guest room B. Where is your sister anyway? Shanai's in Bali teaching non-Eurocentric beauty techniques. Right on, right on. Hmm. Took out a second mortgage on this house to send her to school. I'm going to be paying it off for the rest of my life. Well, why don't you just sell the house then? - She is not going to sell our house. - I am not selling my house. I'll be damned if I move out of this neighborhood now that they got good food and shit. Oh. - Give this to his better half. - Yeah. - Tell her it's from me, please. - Okay. - What is that? - Get your hand out of my pocket. Something for Ashley and my godson. And you'll just lose it. You're not wrong. - Hey, baby. - Hey. Hey, hey, hey, look at this good-looking man! - Hey, what's happening, Marty? - Oh! - How you doing, bro? - I'm good, man. - Staying out of trouble? - Yeah, man, I'm good. - Hey, what's up, Marty? - Hey, what's up? - Nancy, uh, can I have this? - What? Whatcha gonna do with those? Flat irons! Top of the line, metallic, heat-absorbent, alloy metal. Uh-uh. Who the fuck said you could talk in Mama Liz's shop? Mmm-hmm. Oh, shit. This is finnabit a show you want to watch. We've got ceramic and titanium, some for home, some for travel. Wide plates for long weaves, short plates for thinking about going all natural. Boy, please. Those look old. These are from the cosmetology school after just one class. Out the box, but not quite out of gas. They use the best to teach the worst to become the best, and the best is right here and that's what you deserve, so forget the rest. I mean, come on, people! I don't know about that. Well, you haven't even told me how much yet. And Mama Liz does not enjoy suspense. - I don't even like suspense movies. - I don't either. - Fuck Alfred Hitchcock! - Right on. - Fuck him. - And M. Shyamalan Night... That motherfucker could kiss my ass too. - Makes me nervous. - There's always a twist. Let me ask you something. How much is that one you're holding right now? - $140. - $140? I would never! These have gotta be at least a third of the price of that, and, hand to God, I bet they work better. Okay. Who the fuck is this white boy y'all let in my shop? - Tina! - What? I'm just a West Oakland homegrown Bay boy about his town business. Matter of fact, 100% of the proceeds today are actually going towards bilingual education for the youth of Oakland. And it's gonna help men transitioning out of incarceration towards finding a better life and having a second chance. Because that is what our community so desperately needs. - -I feel it, you feel it, we all feel it, we all know it. Come on. They all deserve a second chance. - Here we go. - It's on now. Ooh... How we know these work? I think it look good. You know, it is so uncomfortable to have to fit this shit on my belt, man. Oh, right. Plausible deniability ruined. Thank you. - Shut up. - Thank you very much. That reminds me, man. Made $600. $300 is very much yours. No, bruh, you keep that for La Raza preschool or whatever. How do you mean? You know how family work, man. I got some, you got some. Whatcha talking about? You just get this text about Nak's co-worker's party? Yeah, you trying to go? - Nope. - Nope. Yo, Miles! Miles, can you please come upstairs? Well, hello, Collin's perm! - That looks fucking terrible. - Thank you. I mean, if you gonna perm, why don't you go wherever your mom or Val went? - I wasn't... Come on. - Nancy's hair looks great. The hell you doing talking to Val for? Calmate! I didn't break the picket line, nigga. I just follow her on social medias. You could all be friends with Val still. She's like a really good person. No, the fuck we can't! - Fuck Val! - Okay. Wow. And, baby, unfollow Val on the medias! Hi. Um, I had to take my hair out today for... For this something and... Now I need to get it braided back again before tomorrow. Okay. And you're the only one who can get it done before 11:00. Why's it have to get done by... Right. Why'd you take your hair out? It was profitable to do so. Look, I'm really not trying to make this a us thing. I just really have to get my hair braided. Fine. Let's do it at your mom's house, okay? I have to return a bowl anyway. And this is my study time, so you need to help me memorize stuff. It has to actually be study time. "The tendency to judge the strength of arguments "based on the plausibility of their conclusions, "rather than how strong it is." Belief bias effect. - Yes. Okay. - Next. "The tendency to attribute one's own actions "to external causes while attributing other people's behaviors - "to internal causes." - Blame gaming. Blame gaming. You blame the game. It's actor observer bias. - Yes. - Yes! What are you saying before the answer? Oh, you're gonna love this. This is absolutely your fault. I love that. I made up, like, slang words to help me remember things. Oh, shit. Look at you out here innovating. See, she is still town. I knew it. I'm still town. Who said I'm not town? Nah, I mean, people just be saying things on the street, girl... But it's cool. What, uh, what is this vase one? - Oh, you see a vase? - Why you say it like that? Ooh! It's two faces though! "Rubin's vase. The image is fundamentally ambiguous. "People perceive a vase or faces, "but not both at the same time." All right, so apparently you like vases. Oh, I got you. Facevasin. - Facevasin'. No, try it out. - No. You... Facevasin'. You can't just keep saying it... - Facevasin'. - ...and think it's gonna... It's gotta be like real slang so it'll stick in my head. I'm sprinkling it though. Facevasin'. - Hey. - What? You know I'm a free bird tomorrow, right? - Yes, I do know. - Mmm-hmm. - I'm happy for you. - Me too. You gonna hang out of car windows and curse at people then too? - Why would I do that? - I don't know. You tell me. I got a complaint today that one of our trucks was just honking and yelling at people. A black guy with dreads was - just screaming at everyone. - Nah, nah, nah, that's... - You don't have all the information. - Okay. So what happened, Miles was honking the horn because... - Miles. - There was a dude - that wouldn't get... - Wait, Miles was honking? He was the one who was honking the horn. - We set it up so you would be the driver. - I was driving the truck. I know. - No, I was... Nah. - We talked about this. I was driving. Keep your head straight. I was driving, but if he reach across me and honk the horn, then what I'm supposed to do? Collin, just take some responsibility for the things that are happening around you. I'm not denying it. I'm just saying that maybe this time it wasn't the black guy with dreads that did it. I know you're trying. At least you don't wear that fucking grill anymore. Now if you could just get rid of all this hair. - You'd almost look... - Like less blamable? "Not the hair, bruh. It's my identity, bruh." It is. Yeah, well, your identity is done. And I gotta go. I got it. Thanks. - Can we... Is that? - Yeah. - Thanks. - Okay. Okay, this is why I didn't want to come to your place. Collin! It's 10:45, babe. - Thank you, Nancy! - Sorry to interrupt. Um... - Thank you. - Mmm-hmm. Bye. Really? Oh, wow. That's great, yeah. More details tonight on last night's police shooting in West Oakland. The man killed by police has been identified as Randall Marshall. A foot chase took place down - Adeline Street in West Oakland. - Oh, here we go. They gonna... Watch, they gonna use his professional police photo. And they gonna use... Oh, come on! Use bruh's work photo! Got him in the orange jumper! They couldn't find one picture of bruh in his own shit? - Calm down! Chill out! - That's so disrespectful. - Man, you can't find another... - He's just asleep. - They can't find... - We just got him to sleep. The recent felon was carrying an unlicensed concealed weapon. Felon, convicted felon. Wrong cocktail, my G. You gets no protest. Marshall was running towards West Grand Avenue away from Officer Molina, who fired four shots, killing him. Marshall lived on 32nd Street with his girlfriend and three-year-old daughter. You're late, Mr. Hoskins. You just stand there all day? Isn't this something we could automate? You want a robot telling you to mop the bathroom? How about a robot that just mops the bathroom? - Then I can go get some sleep. - Solutions oriented. - See, I like that. - Even better. How about motherfuckers just don't get arrested for dumb shit? I see where we're going here, but if we could just get to it... Then I don't have to enforce seemingly arbitrary tasks to establish your ability to follow rules as a representation of law. Arbitrary. That's the word right there. Don't make me write you up for your last week. The judge will extend your time here a year. And then your little map box sentence starts over. Convicted on dirty bathroom charges? You are now a convicted felon, Mr. Hoskins. You are now that until proven otherwise. Prove otherwise at all times.

Cuz cuz, I can't be around the way way with something outta pocket. Ya underdig? Get blurped and I gotta peel out for the Daytona five double-O 'cause I got a few hammers tucked. Niggas got laundry, no bleach. On mamas, this was in the cut. Three bill joog though? What's the part two? No sequel, bruh. Pockets is touching so we just trying to get it off and do a moving. Cuz, I might have to let that marinate one time. Bruh, if you really about that life, this the come-up right here. Plus three bills ain't nothing but a small thing to a giant like yourself. I say let's make moves, you throw me that three hundo right there. I'ma clip the woo wop to the rear-view and less is more, ya dig? Clip the wop to the rear-view? By far. - Fast! - Fast! What'd he say? Oh, I have no idea. But he gave me $300 for this boat. Sold! Sold, motherfucka, sold! Mouthpiece for days, bruh. People like the way I make 'em feel, man. They like the bounce of that shit. Everybody listen more when you make it sound pretty. Tell you right now. All right, hey, I'ma go back to the office. I'll clock us both out. Come back in like an hour though, we got the feast in a second. - Got you. - Fo sho, right? Yeah, I'll be right back. She didn't come visit you one time, bruh. I know. I was there. - You're all set for Friday. - Cool. - Awesome. Thank you. - Thank you. I got her number. That's just the office number. I don't know. Maybe she lives here. Yo, uh, excuse me, bruh. Did you used to work the door at The Alley? Yeah. - That was like a minute ago. - Yeah, you did. Oh, shit, bro! This is that motherfucka with the Scorpion Bowl at The Alley that I told you about. What dude with the Scorpion Bowl? I never told you about the Scorpion King? This is him! We really don't have to do this right now. Yeah, we do. Okay, okay, okay. - You know The Alley, right? - Yeah, over on Grand? - Yeah. It's an institution. - Oh, my God, this story is so fuckin' dope! So the night is crackin'. I'm looking fly, when this Colorado white boy saunters up to the bar. He's like, "Wassup, bruh? Get me one of those." And he orders the Scorpion Bowl. This thing is like a giant swimming pool of fucking booze with a flame in the middle. It's like a white person's wet dream. This dude sees the Scorpion Bowl, and, like, he grows hair on his chest, like, his balls drop. The motherfucka hits puberty right there in that moment. - His mind is... - Blown! Hey, listen up, everybody! It's Scorpion time! Meanwhile, this nigga right here... Uh, excuse me. - This gentleman. - You can only say that with me. Yeah, my bad. I was out of my mind right then. This dude right here is just standing outside working the door, looking hella fresh, might I add. There's this white boy on the stool and he's like hella hard. You know what I'm saying? He got tatted up. He's looking grizzled. Now I'm blowing a cigarette. - I thought that you said that... - I'ma gonna quit. I'm gonna fucking quit, I know. All right? Just leave me alone. I'm so sorry. He keeps interrupting me. So anyway, Jason Biggs busts through the door, and he's like, "Guys, guys, guys! "Look at this fucking fire drink. "It's fucking insane." But then my dude steps up, and he's like, "Hey, bruh, you can't bring alcohol out here. "You gotta take that back inside." Motherfucka Topher Grace responds, "Calm down. I'm just gonna show my friends for like two seconds," "then I'm gonna go back inside, okay? "And if I don't and you lose your job, "I'll get you a new job, dawg." - What? - Right? - Now, shit gets bad. - Now it gets bad? 'Cause you a bad man. You know what I'm saying? So he's like, "The fuck you say?" "I'll go back inside, right? I'll go back inside." My man stops him like, "You're done. Give me the fucking goblet thing." "First of all, it's a Scorpion Bowl, okay? "And second, no! "I fucking paid for this thing." And then he slaps his arm. - Remember the white boy on the stool? - On the stool? Yeah. Guess what? He's a fucking psycho. 'Cause he's like, "Hey, you better know where you're at, fuckboy, "before some real town shit happen to you." And then, Neil Patrick Harris pushed him. Hard! - Would you ever push this dude? - I would not. This motherfucka looks just like Krayzie Bone. ♪ Sawed-off Leatha face ♪ My man snaps like the fucking Incredible Hulk and he's like... Little white boy reaches up like The Undertaker. Gets him in a fucking chokehold, right? Then, Oakland white boy jumps in and starts kicking him. And he's fucking Chuck Norris on this motherfucker, and he's like... "I hate my dad!" And they're just beating the shit out of Topher, you know what I'm saying? And it's a fucking menage a trois of violence, bro. Now, mind you, that drink is still on fire. Oh, I forgot about the flame. It is still burning. That fire catches some of that alcohol and ignites. And now that flame's rolling, rolling, rolling and... They are ablaze. Whoosh! Inferno, motherfucker! Portlandia's on the ground, going up in flames. And my ass is just standing there. I'm just like, "Shit. Look out." It's like Michael B. Jordan on fire and Chris Evans on fire. And you'd think the fight would be over, but, nah, this dude has lost it. His fucking friend is like Michael Flatley in the Lord of the Dance all over this motherfucker's face while he cooks. And he's like, "Welcome to Oakland, bitch." He's bleeding, he's cooking, these dudes is pounding on him. Peoples is screaming. Whoo! Fuck. That shit was nuts. Damn. That really happen? Yeah. It did. Help me, please! What's up now, bitch? Huh? Huh? Help, please! - You ain't fuckin' with it now, huh? - Help me! I can't breathe! I can't... - Fucking stop! Stop! - Oh, no! Fuck! Motherfucker! Motherfucker! Him and his white friend stomped that drunk dude until he was unconscious. He was in the hospital for a week? And all over a drink. Well, we gotta go. - Well, this has been fun. - Yeah. - All right. - Thanks. You're about to get a fresh restart. You need to get rid of Miles. - Miles is my best friend. - Yeah, is he? 'Cause I know you guys grew up together, but he's gonna put you back in jail or he's gonna get you fucking killed. Miles had my back since we were 11 years old. When I went to jail, Miles came and saw me all the time. I'm not talking about this with you again. He came to visit you out of guilt. 'Cause he pushed you into a fight, and he didn't go to jail with you. What if that dude had had a gun? What if Miles' dumb ass had a gun? What if the cops showed up and they saw you stomping that white dude? Who do you think they would have shot? Miles? Good night, Val. - I'm just... Collin, I'm... - Yeah, I know. Three, two, one. Yeah! Whoo! - You suck! $7, sir! - All right, here's the thing. Here's the thing. I don't have it right now. But I'ma get... I'm good for it. Wait. I got a better idea. Let's race again. - 'Bout to beat you in another car race. - No, you won't. Hey. Made those bed pieces. I mean, they weren't... Wasn't... No, not these ones. But ones just like it. Where do you make beds? In jail. Why were you in jail? For being a tough guy. Dinner's ready! Coming, Mom! I'm tellin' ya, I'm gonna let you finish, but don't fuck up my chart board. 'Cause I just got that. This is gonna be just fine. Don't worry about it. - Hey, Collin. - Yeah. You gonna smoke with your friend here? I think I'm good off the weed now. - Wow. - It's like I see that it's him, I hear that it's him, but then he gonna say some shit like that. What am I over here doing this for? - Changed man, I guess. - I don't know this person. Okay, change. For what? - He don't want weed no more. - Oh, okay. Oh, now you conspiring against me too? He picked this especially for you. What is this? You got me a present? You wanna touch a tender thug in his emotions with this beautiful gesture of love? - You're so stupid. - Look at this! Boy! Come here. Give me a hug. Yes, thank you! All right. Do me a favor. Hold this for one second. Good job. This shirt look kinda small, don't it? Oh, let me see. Let me see. - Oh, baby, you look so good. - Baby, you look so good. This is like a little baby T. What are y'all talking about? No! You look hella good. I can see every little thing in your arm. Yeah, it's framing your pectorals. - You can see this tattoo. - Real nice. - One of my favorite tattoos. - Man, this shirt is too small. - And both of y'all know that shit. - No, it's not. - Look at this little baby shirt! - No, it's not. - You could pierce the nipple and... - That looks so good. - No. No. No. - It looks amazing. It's perfect. Look at this little thing. I can't... Hey, Sean, why don't you put that down, man? Baby, put that down. Put that down, man. Sean. Sean. Is this your gun, Collin? No. Miles, get the fuck out now! - It was an accident, all right? - You brought a fucking gun - into this house! Get out now! - It was an accident! Just get the fuck out! Go! Get out! Don't fucking come back here! Get out! - Ashley, I'm so sorry. - And you let him buy one. - I didn't... - Get out! Now! All right. Here. Get rid of it! You couldn't just make it yours for two fucking seconds. No! It's not mine! And I didn't want to have shit to do with that fucking gun in the first place! Don't make it yours then. Just make it not mine! I'm not gonna bring a gun around a little kid, Miles! So what? I'm the father who brought that shit around his son? - Isn't that what happened? - I know what happened! How's it going, boy? What's up, man? Fuck it. Well, you... What? Fuck what? I'm calling us a Uber and we're going to Nak's party. The hell we are. I'm not going to that fucking party. Well, we're not going back in there, are we? And, what, you gonna spend your first day not having a curfew in a halfway house? I'm not trying to go to some party where no bullshit is gonna jump off. The bullshit is out here. Are you kidding me? That party's full of the squarest of the squares. Nak works for Pandora! It's gonna be safe! It's gonna be nothing but hipsters and artisan beer and shit. You know, goat cheese, acoustic guitar, light music. Collin. Bruh! Yes. It's a better idea. Yes. Out here? This is where you wanna be? - Here. Look around. - All right. All right. All right, but I'm not trying to get involved with no hot shit tonight! Oh. The car's here. Oh! My niggas! Your Uber has arrived! Dezz, boy, what are the chances of this? - Of fucking course. - Oh, Collin! I got a little somethin'-somethin' for you in the trunk! Celebrate your freedom. Commander Smiley.

Finally found my home. Hey, thank you, Sid. Anytime. You take care. Come on in. - He has the same tattoo. - Shut the fuck up. There go Nak. I need a drink. Yes, you are a great dancer. - Hello. Hi, there. - What's up? All right, pig on a shirt. - Nak? - Wow. What's up? Oh! Man, you never respond to my invites. - I mean... - And this was a weird one to come to. - Yes. - It's one of our CEO's monthly mixers. Define mixer. Well, right now, it's mixed 150 white people with, now, three black people. - Hmm. - Oh, Terry, this is Collin. Terry and I worked at Youth Radio together. How's it going, man? What is that?

I'm like, um, "Don't talk like that. That's not you." - Thank you. - Thank you. Somebody had to tell him. You know what? I made two more in the kitchen, I'll be right back. Oh, my goodness.

What the fuck, man, and then what? Then they gonna call the fucking cops, and they gonna shoot my black ass and not you! What the fuck is wrong with you? You didn't do shit back there! - That... - You didn't do shit, bruh! That is Nak's partner! I don't give a fuck who the fuck it is! Nak's partner, is that yo' partner? No! Is that yo' partner? No! You know how many times I'da have yo' back out here? How many motherfucking times I'da stepped up fo yo' ass? Huh? And you didn't do shit to help me! - Because... - Look at my face, bruh! Because it was fucking stupid, Miles! Look who the fuck I am? Where the fuck I am, Collin? That's how the fuck I survive out here! You wanna act brand-new, then fine. Go ahead. Be a hipster, get a tech job or some shit. And go act like you don't know where the fuck you from! I ain't got to prove to nobody where the fuck I'm from! Oh, good for you! Nigga, you got something to prove to everybody! Yeah? That's 'cause I'm livin' somewhere where now everybody got me fucked up! You ain't gotta do shit! You ain't gotta... You ain't gotta worry about you changing up your clothes or your lifestyle. You ain't gotta worry about none of that shit! You're a big black dude with fucking braids in Oakland! Nobody is misreading you, Collin. Yeah. Yeah, I know. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah? - Yeah, my nigga. - Yeah, bruh. Nope. Say it. What? Say "nigga." - Oh, fuck you! - Say it! Say, "Yeah, my nigga!" - No, and you know... - Why? Why? - Come the fuck on! - But... But why? 'Cause you know I don't say that shit! But what? So it's okay for me to call you nigga, nigga? You been calling me that since we were fucking 12 years old. I'm not gonna stop you now. Do what the fuck you want to, - say what you want to say. - Nigga, if that is so disrespectful, then why is it okay for me to call you that? You're a fucking nigga! - You're a fucking nigga, Miles! - Why are we talking about... You out here acting an ass like it ain't no fucking consequences for that shit. And every nigga who sees me thinks that I do the same dumb, fuckin' ignorant, gun-carrying shit that you do! But I've been taking care of my shit! I fucking... Don't I do our timecards every week? I pick us up. I keep you out of dumb shit, and then what do you do? You go out and you buy a fucking gun for what? For your family? You are the nigger that they are out here looking for! Where the fuck you goin'? Where the fuck are you goin'? Collin! Collin! Well then, fuck you then! You hear that? Then, fuck you then! You better not have no fuckin' gun on you, 'cause... Miles, what the hell happened? - Ow, Ash. - Shut up. - Ow, the shit's broken! - Shut up! I got into a fucking fight! The fuck you want me to do about it, huh? You wanna fight about the shit too? You're picking the wrong fights, all right? This is already hard. This is work. He is work, and I don't feel like you are here with me right now! I didn't buy that gun on no tough shit, all right? I know why you thought you needed to buy a gun! Just let me ask you something. Were you afraid when you came out here and saw Sean holding a gun? Yes. And do you think if you would have possibly told me about buying a gun that I might have seen the scenario coming? I'm sorry. I didn't... I'm sorry. Well, maybe if you niggas weren't so wild all the fuckin' time. Could you not call me that? What, "nigga"? Yeah, can you not call me that, please? Okay. Hi. Hi. Um... How's the... How's the memorizing coming? Yeah, just trying to learn these psych terms. What did you come up with for the double picture one? The face and the vase one? Oh, I like that one. It was "blindspotting." Why "blindspotting"? 'Cause it's all about how you can look at something, and there can be another thing there that you aren't seeing. So you got a blind spot. But if somebody points out the other picture to you, doesn't that make it not a blind spot anymore? No, 'cause you can't go against what your brain wants to see first. Unless you spend the time to retrain your brain, which is hella hard, so you're always gonna be instinctually blind to the spot you weren't seeing. Collin? When you look at me now, do you always see the fight first? Good night, Valerie. Collin... You late. We gotta go straight to the first move, all right? I got the address from the office. Just gotta put my shoes on. Come on. Nah, I'm good out here. Fine. Congratulations, Collin. Thank you, Sean. It's real nice of you, bruh. Ow, okay. Okay. It's not a good time. Sean. Sean, all right, cut it out. Sean, all right, enough. I'm serious. Sean, enough. Enough. Hey! Hey, stop! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! What did he just say? Oh, are you outside practicing with Collin? He's a little too young for the pamphlets that your mama gave us, but I'm trying to get ahead early. - Good morning. - Commander Moving for Rachel. So, it's just a ton of boxes in the living room, mostly. Uh, my son and I are gonna take off, but my, um, husband is inside somewhere if you wanna go... Okay, so everything is just in here then? Yes. Um... Sorry about that. I canceled the service, but it beeps by default when it's open. Just close the door behind you when you're done. I left my jacket inside, so I'll go get the last box. Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh. Collin! Shit. Collin! Yo, Collin! Hey, bro, we need to... - Uh-uh-uh-uh. - Shit! Don't. Don't. Does this scare you, huh? Fuck you know about being scared? Were you afraid someone was gonna come find you? Huh? - Bruh. - What? Nigga, I'm just... I'm just talking to him! Ha! You said make it pretty, right? It's the bounce of it. They like the bounce of it. Like a tree on a sign, nigga, we cut right down. Paul Bunyan-ass cops, come to chop me at the knees and search the trunk in my own town. Did you count his rings when you bled him? Huh? When you dead him? Do you understand? How old was he? Nigga, how old was he? - He was 26. - Twenty-six?

So what, y'all fucks with the Raiders now? Don't be absurd, Collin. That would be disloyal of me to do. I can't stoop to their level. I'm just mad at them forcing me into this very confusing position. - Uh-huh. - Loyalty is tricky, Collin. It's a moving target. Bet you wish you were a better moving target. You tryin' to talk about my face, bruh? Too soon, man! Hey, you look fucked up. I am fucked up. Subtitles by explosiveskull
