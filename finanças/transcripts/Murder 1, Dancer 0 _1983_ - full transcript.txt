[ music box playing ] [ theme music playing ] [ train horn blaring ] [ narrating ] The trail had taken me east to Phoenix and Cleveland, then south to Miami and Nassau, then back to Biloxi again... All in three days. When I got what I went after, I did what I always do when I bust my hump on a case... I got on a train. I sat in my compartment with a square bottle, looking out the window, watching the world roll by and imagined it was the '’40s, and Johnny came marching home and the world was terrific. The job I had done went down the way I had expected, the way they'’d all gone down... Shabby, lonely, and a little bit dangerous. I had no complaints. That'’s the way it was and always would be as long as I kept on being what I was... A private detective. My name is Joe dancer. Southern California'’s my back yard. But I go anywhere, anytime, if the price is right. I dozed off on the train, so I was rested. I was gonna fall by little Al'’s bar, listen to some Bessie Smith on the jukebox, down a few from a square bottle and get my identity back. [ horn blares ] They had taken me in for a concussion, checked me out and I was cool. But my gimpy knee was killing me and I had a headache that would register on the Richter scale. The boy wasn'’t as lucky. He was dead. Herbie Quinlan was homicide. I called him when they took me into the hospital. He came over and I told him my story. Herbie, I'’m telling you, somebody sandbagged you. -Somebody sandbagged me? -They should have taken you right to the scene of the crime... What crime? So you can do a full investigation. It was an accident. Let me check the kid. Would you like to sign here, please? Yeah. Well... D.A.'’s gonna be looking along the lines of accidental manslaughter. Leave it alone, huh? Herbie, I already told you... All right maybe I was a little excited before, but now I'’m calm. I'’m telling you, Herbie, it was not an accident. Look, you called me here, I came over. You gave me your story, huh? Now I'’m telling you you'’re crazy. I'’m not crazy! Did you read the coroner'’s report? -Yeah. -The kid didn'’t take any booze. He'’s not a doper. If he did want to kill himself, is he gonna jump in front of a car? -Dancer... -No! Dancer, your reputation is bad enough. You'’ve had enough trouble with the heat. You'’re off the hook. Why do you want to open up a can of peas? -What do you mean, "Why"? -Why? Because I didn'’t kill him, that'’s why. Herbie, I'’m telling you somebody killed that kid. They used me for the gun, and I'’m gonna get to the bottom of it. I'’ve known you a long while, huh? Leave it alone. Leave it alone. You ain'’t giving me advice, Herbie. You'’re telling me to leave it alone, ain'’t you? I don'’t know what you'’re talking about. Yes, you do. No, I don'’t know what you're talking about! You wanna think I'’m tellin' ya? I'’m tellin' ya! [ narrating ] Three days later there was a funeral. The kid'’s name was Steve Burnell. He'’d never see his 18th birthday. He came to California six months ago with the only family he had... His sister. Kid, I know you didn'’t just walk in front of my car. Somebody took your life, and that somebody'’s gonna pay... From me to you. May I ask, who are you? My name is Joe Dancer. Dancer, the man who was driving the car that killed my brother? Yes. How do you feel about that? I feel, uh... Sad and angry. -How about guilty? -No. That would be a lie. There was no way to avoid your brother. When the police came and told me what happened to Steve, I asked them about you. They said you'’re a private detective. Yes. Can we talk sometime? How about now? Now'’s just fine. I'’m Jenny. [ narrating ] She had a story to tell, and it was a strange one. It had to do with a box-office superstar, Judd Hampton. He had starred in TV, and two movies later you could buy a studio with his name. Wait. That'’s it. Are you sure? Dancer: There'’s two Highfields. It'’s a horseshoe. Jenny: I don'’t understand. Dancer: It'’s okay, honey. I think I understand what happened now. This could have been his mistake. He took the wrong Highfield. You said it was two houses up? Second house on the street, yeah. Let'’s go see if anybody's home. Everything'’s okay. [ doorbell rings ] [ narrating ] Somebody had moved out fast... Cleaned the joint and left no tale to tell. While we were going through I had her lay it out for me again, exactly what her brother had seen and what he told her that night. Jenny: Well, Steve said he had just arrived at the house that night. It'’s the same as the house... No furniture. And I'’ll bet the pool is... Warm. What is it? I don'’t know. You see something down there? Yeah. It'’s an antique. How do you know? My mother had a locket just like that. Your brother said two girls. Yeah. Let me see it. Never mind. Joe, let me see it. [ narrating ] I made a call to my phone mate Charlie. I told her to reach a friend of mine downtown. I wanted to know who owned or leased that house on Highfield. Then I stopped at a photographer'’s studio. I wanted those photos blown up, have copies made. They'’d be my calling card to Judd Hampton. I should have taken Jenny straight home, but the man with the red hair was on my mind. The one her brother saw on the floor in the living room. I had a hunch about him. Male redhead... That all you can give me? Yeah, that'’s all I got. Uh, that and the probable time of death... Sometime Friday night. [ snickers ] You'’re shopping, Dancer. Yeah, I heard this is the general store. When did you start having your lunch shipped in? When L.A. Became the murder capital of the world. I got 64 stiffs I'’m working on. [ groans ] This is number 61. [ groans ] Tell me about him. Name: Mike Wallace. -Address... -Forget it. - Next of kin... -None. How do you know? He'’s still here, ain't he? Go on. Occupation: Screen extra. Very interesting. What'’s the cause of death? Internal injuries contributed to accident. Accident? What accident? Where? Car crash. Ran head-on into a utility pole at 2700 block, Calder Canyon. Yeah, sure. Pronounced dead at the site. Phew. [ narrating ] Yeah, he was dead on the site... Where somebody had beat his brains in. The cops had backed away from Jenny'’s brother's death. They had backed away from the redhead'’s death. Then that funny thing happened in the back of my neck. Why were those guys looking at Jenny? Jenny! Get out! [ Jenny gasping ] -It'’s okay. They were trying to kill us! -It'’s okay. -They were trying to kill us! We'’re both alive. Take it easy. -Oh, Joe! -Take it easy. It'’s all right. I'’ll get you to the cops. What? No, I can'’t get you to the cops. -Shhh. -Joe! We gotta get out of here, Jenny. What did I do? What did I do? You'’ll be all right, I promise you. You'’ll be all right. Yeah, Herbie, this is Dancer. Listen, I got big troubles. You don'’t know the half of it. Don'’t talk to anybody. Don'’t come here. Where can I meet you? Uh... You know down at the end of the pier? Give me till about sundown and I'’ll see you there. [ narrating ] The car agency was bugged about the car I turned in. I was more bugged about Quinlan. How did he know I was in trouble? It didn'’t track. I didn't know whose side he was on. Is this where you live? I don'’t live anyplace. I got joints like this all over town. I change them every once in a while. That way, nobody knows nothing. [ arcade music playing ] Okay, there'’s food up there in the cupboard, TV dinners in the fridge, and if you open the windows, any window... You can hear the ocean. Sit your bones down here and take it easy. You'’re safe. Wait, Joe. Where are you going? Honey, your brother saw something, and because of it they killed him. The cops are in on it, I can'’t take you there. I gotta go out on the streets and find out what the hell is going on. I gotta talk to somebody. You stay here. Don'’t worry. You'll be safe. Just keep that front door locked and I'’ll be in touch. If the phone rings, it'’ll be me. -Joe? -Yeah? What about the noise? What noise? I don'’t hear any noise. When I sleep here I sleep like a baby. [ narrating ] Was my promise to the kid at his grave gonna cost his sister her life? Quinlan had asked a good question: "Why do you want to open up a can of peas?" Forget your fishing pole? No. Something tells me you'’re gonna wish you had forgotten yours. Yeah. -Let'’s drink. -Okay. [ narrating ] Over three hours and a bag of drinks, I filled Quinlan in on the redheaded kid in the morgue. Quinlan knew the cop on the case, said he was straight. Said he'’d run it down. Quinlan and I drank till closing time. He dropped me off at an all-night steam bath. I got my clothes pressed. The next morning Charlie told me my pictures were ready. -Joseph. -Yeah. I am pleased. Good stuff. Good clarity. The work of a pro. What do you mean? How do you know that? Come here. I'’ll show you. Look at that. See that? The lighting... This guy'’s sharp. Something else: The way they were developed. Retouched. Airbrushed. Like that, you know? See? Oh yeah, that'’s definitely the work of a pro, then, huh? Definitely the work of a pro. These broads are models? [ chuckles ] Well, let'’s put it this way, they don'’t come from my world, but I'’ll give you a guess what world they come from. You mean there'’s models and then there'’s models? On the nose, Jefe. [ narrating ] It was time to go to the source, the studio that had Judd Hampton under contract for five years. The biggest in town... Polaris... A subsidiary of Z.T.Y. And Z.T.Y. was one of the largest conglomerates in the world. The kid had a $30-million picture in the can. I wanted to talk to his boss. Excuse me. Which one of you ladies works for the boss? I beg your pardon. Can I help you? Asa Lemar... Which one of you works... Never mind. Somebody go tell Asa Lemar my name is Joe Dancer. I got some information about Judd Hampton and a house on Highfield. Tell him that and he'’ll talk to me. I can'’t do that, sir. Well, you better. This is very important... There'’s no wrong way, right way; just my way. Get the budget right, because the picture will start on time. You and Carol work it out. Excuse me. Which one of you gentlemen is Asa Lemar? Mr. Lemar, I'’m terribly sorry, sir. Oh, you are. I would like to talk to you about Judd Hampton and a house on Highfield. What is your name, sir? My name is Joe Dancer. I'’m a private detective and I have some information on your movie star Judd Hampton. Judd Hampton is under contract to our studio, but, uh... What was your name again? Dancer. Mr. Dancer, I don'’t get personally involved with our stars'’ lives, but if you have some information... Excuse me, you better get involved this time, Because the studio'’s in trouble. Let me finish, Mr. Dancer. I think this will be more in Mr. Iberville'’s department. We have a large studio here. We delegate different matters to different departments. I'’m sure Mr. Iberville will handle it to your total satisfaction. Carol, I want you to get in touch with the Berlin office. Mr. Dancer... If you will. Are you a writer, Mr. Dancer, along with your other profession? No. But I got a story to tell. Is something wrong with your knee? That'’s part of the story I'’m gonna tell you. You see, it starts out with this studio that'’s trying to keep a movie star afloat. And it'’s about murder, and an executive in a black suit that covered it up. It'’s called "Accessory after the fact: Murder one." Nice title. Go on. I will. It starts out with this movie star who likes to play around with two girls at a time. And then it goes on to this redheaded kid who went to a house on Highfield and caught him. And then about a punchout, and a redheaded kid going down and dead. And that'’s just the beginning. It'’s starting to smack of a b-movie, Mr. Dancer. We don'’t write those kinds of movies anymore. Well, you wrote this one. This studio threw a 17-year-old kid in front of my car, mister, and I killed him. Mr. Dancer, I am aware of every script that comes into this studio. And I'’ve never read that one. Well, you can bet your life that somebody'’s gonna read it. I got a star for it too. His name'’s Judd Hampton. Mr. Dancer, that'’s a shame, because that story is a B-movie, and Judd Hampton only makes A-movies. In fact he'’s been making one on location in Northern California. He'’s been up there for three weeks. They just moved to a closer location in Marineland. So that presents a little problem for your scenario, doesn'’t it? Only on the surface. Well, perhaps you can present your story to another studio, Mr. Dancer. You can bet I'’ll shop it around. Is there anything else? You tell Asa Lemar... And I'’m telling you... This is only act one. [ narrating ] Iberville figured he covered his tracks pretty well. But the one thing he couldn'’t cover was the look between him and Lemar. I didn'’t know what it meant, but I was gonna find out. Put that hand behind your back. Get it back there! Where'’s your I.D.? Empty glove... Belongs to a rental car. You got new shoes on. Turn that hand over. Let me see your palm. Yeah, if you'’re a construction worker I'’m a ballet dancer. Call Donald Duck over here. And don'’t get cute. [ horn honks ] You see what I got here? -Easy... -Shut up. Get in. All right. Now I know what both of you guys are doing here. We'’re both in the same profession, but we'’re working different sides of the street. Now get back to your boss Asa Lemar and tell him you don'’t work this side of the street no more. Next guy shows up here winds up in the drink. Okay? How about a little ride, Dancer? [ gasping ] [ narrating ] They really did a hell of a number on me but they didn'’t kill me. More important, they knew I wasn'’t gonna shoot. They were pros. Lemar only hired the best. They called my bluff and I backed off. One thing was for sure: Lemar wanted me back in the hospital and out of action. I took Jenny to a place back of the beyond. I made sure I wasn'’t followed. I knew Jenny would be safe with Cow John. But I'’d said that before. Hey, Cow John! -How you doing? -Fine, Joe. -This here is Jenny. -She'’s pretty, ain't she? -Thank you. -Come on in. Reminds me of my woman when we were both young. Go on, beat it. Ah, yeah. -Joe? -Huh? Why don'’t you put her things in your old room? Good enough. Jenny: I'’m sorry about your wife. Joe said that she died a couple of months ago. It was 20 years ago. Joe'’s a dear guy. He knows that I feel it just a little while ago. I like to keep a fire going all the time, in all seasons. My daddy did too. He did? Then the two of us are gonna get along just fine. [ narrating ] I knew the redheaded kid was killed by Judd Hampton. I knew Jenny'’s life was in danger. I was guessin'’ the studio was behind the clean-up and Steve Burnell'’s death. And I was guessing the studio was Asa Lemar. The cops were dirty. Jenny'’s story had smelled and the cops backed away from it. That meant big money. And what it all hung on was a little punk, Judd Hampton. -Man: All right, quiet! -Quiet. Quiet, everyone. Camera! Sound! -Man #1: Roll '’em! -Man #2: Speed. Man #1: Action! [ grunts ] [ actors grunting ] [ screams ] [ cheering ] Say, was that Judd Hampton that did that? -No, photo double. -Oh. Where'’s he? He'’s got a trailer in the back. Thanks. [ narrating ] People kept going in and coming out of Judd Hampton'’s motor home. Agents, starlets, people on the take, people on the come... I was looking for the guy that made the least money, the guy with the fishiest eyes. He wasn'’t hard to spot. He was the guy calling in the broads, calling the bets for the weekend football games hoping somebody'’d win big so he could get a piece of the action. He was the cuckoo in the clock. I knew he'’d pop out again. Hey, pal. Can I talk to you for a minute? Don'’t get mad at me, I might have a little business to talk to you about. I got a little favor I want you to do. There'’s 100 bucks in it for ya and another 100 on the back end if you deliver. I want you to take this envelope, give it to Judd Hampton. Make sure he sees what'’s inside it, tell him I wanna talk to him. If you get me in there, I'’ll give you the other yard. Hey, you'’re not gonna do nothing funny with the money, are you? I ain'’t stupid, pal. [ door slams ] Take your best shot, he'’s waiting with open arms. You'’ve got a unique way of introducing yourself, mister... Dancer. Joe Dancer. Are the ladies in the photographs relatives? No, not even kissing cousins. What, do you represent them? Are you their agent? You got one more cute line, kid. Use it, then clear this joint out. Come on, gang. It'’s five minutes to post time. Let'’s go to the windows. Come on! Come on. I don'’t know what you want, mister, but if you'’re looking for trouble, all I gotta do is yell. Kid, you let me in here '’cause you know I'm trouble. Go ahead and yell. I let you in here, mister, because I thought you were a friend of Gofer'’s. I don'’t know what you want from me. All right, we'’ll play it your way. You'’re a big movie star. But you'’re still just a punk kid, you don'’t know nothing about the big leagues. You don'’t even know what murder one is, do you? I don'’t know what you'’re talking about. Accidental homicide carries with it... Nothing. You left the scene of the crime, but it'’s a first offense. My guess is a suspended sentence. I'’m not talking doubletalk here. I'’m telling you, I know you did it. Now if you cop to me, you got a chance of getting off. Tell me the kid hit you five times before he went down. I'’ll believe you and so will a judge. I'’m here to tell you, get yourself off the hook. Don'’t listen to what the studio'’s telling you, listen to me. The longer you wait, the more trouble you'’re in. Think about what I'’m telling you. I'’ll come back and see you. [ door opens, closes ] [ narrating ] It was time to talk to Herbie Quinlan. See what kind of cards he was holding and who he was dealing for. We had arranged to meet at his boat. -Hey, Herbie. -Hey, come on. This is your boat? Nah, "The Sea Quinn'’s" out there. Can barely afford the boat, nevermind the rent on a slip. Let'’s go for a spin. Dancer: All right, I'’m rowing. The red-headed kid, Mark Wallace... Yeah. The one you saw in the morgue, his car drove smack into a utility pole. Hmm. Kid wasn'’t even driving the car. Put mounting holes in the floorboards under the steering wheel... Screw-holes in the brake and gas pedals. Jesus. I think that car was externally driven into that pole. You mean you know it was, Herbie. I don'’t know it. I mean, I can'’t prove it. I'’d bet on it. And the cop who rolled on it... What'’d he do, just quit? No, like me, he was told to take a walk. Where'’s the car now? Wholesale. Where all the other cars are, the police yard. When we got on, you cast off, -I'’ll fire the engine. -Okey-doke. Maybe we can catch us some dinner, exchange what little we know. [ narrating ] Quinlan was giving me information, but everything he was giving me dead-ended. I smelled something wrong. Was he suckering me into something to throw me off the track? Was Herbie on the payroll? When the stakes are high enough, they say you can buy anybody, even the guy who wrote the bible. [ engine sputtering ] [ gagging, coughing ] Herbie! Quinlan! Herbie! Herbie! [ narrating ] The cops were dirty. They'’d covered up when the kid got thrown in front of my car. They'’d covered up the red-headed kid'’s death. And they'’d told Quinlan not to go to work anymore. Were things bad enough to kill him or did somebody else do that? Or was that somebody powerful enough to buy the cop to the point where they'’d kill their own? Who was that powerful? Not Judd Hampton. Not Iberville. Only one person could put this whole thing to bed... Asa Lemar. And be sure that you use a sprig of basil and a fresh sprig of rosemary. It'’s the only way it tastes different. -And make it 350... -[ phone ringing ] Oh, wait, John Paul, hold on. -Joe? -Yeah, honey, give it to me. I'’ve been waiting two days. I know you'’re strung out, Joe. That'’s a terrible thing that happened to you. Okay, the house on Highfield is owned by a Chapman realty and it'’s been leased for a year and a half by a man named Phil Easton. -Who the hell is he? -I had a make run on him by your friend downtown, Billy Primo. He runs a chain of massage parlors. And, Joe, he owns one of those, um, you know, porno studios on Santa Monica boulevard. -And Joe? -Yeah? Call me. Okay. [ narrating ] The report of Quinlan'’s death came over the evening news. They wrote it off as an accident. It got dirtier. Charlie'’s information led me to the gutter to Phil Easton'’s office building where he made hardcore films with softcore bodies. [ sirens wailing ] [ doorknob rattles ] Man: Baby, this is a nice party, huh? We'’re gonna have a good party all our own now, huh? Huh? [ laughs ] Man: This is my little world, honey. These are some of my pictures. I'’m gonna make you a star, baby. Give you anything you want... A little grass, coke... Drop a couple '’ludes. Here'’s Mr. Easton's office. Phil Easton. That'’s me. Right in here, honey. You'’re gonna be fine. Just fine. Nothing to worry about. Don'’t be scared. You'’re gonna be just fine, honey. Just fine. Look at this. It'’s our world, baby. Ours. Do you like it? Huh? You'’re gonna be part of it, baby. [ laughs ] I'’m gonna make you part of it. And I could get you anything you want, baby. Anything. Grass, coke... Wanna have a couple '’ludes, huh? Huh? Do ya? [ whispers ] Yeah... You'’re beautiful, baby. I'’m gonna make a star out of you, honey. Yes, I am. I'’m gonna make a star out of you. [ chuckles ] Oooh. Nice. And, uh... Gonna have sun... [ distant sirens wailing ] And parties. And, uh... Plenty of... Talk shows. Cars. And, uh... I want to try you first before I turn you loose. -[ woman gasps ] -Hey... Shut up! Shut up! Put yourself together! Get out of here! Hey, listen, man! I only got credit cards. That'’s all I got. We don'’t keep no money here. -You scumbag. -I got nothing, man! I swear to God, I got nothing. [ gasping ] I can'’t take it. I can'’t... I got... I got high blood pressure. Tell me about the house on Highfield, the two broads in the house on Highfield! [ gasping ] I don'’t... I don'’t know nothing about no... Tell me about the house! Get out of here, I said! Go on! Tell me about the house on Highfield or I'’ll put this flashlight up in your brain! -Tell me! -I lease that house! I lease that house for my movies! Who'’s your partner with you? Who are you working with?! Who are you in business with?! -Nobody! I just... -Who owns the house with you?! Nobody. I lease that house for my movies. Honest, mister. [ moans ] Please, please. All right, listen to me. Listen to me! That house is hot. Somebody died in it. If you go to the heat, they'’ll fry you. You got 24 hours to get your memory back! I'’ll be seeing you. [ gasping ] Please... [ door opens, closes ] -[ Easton panting ] -[ phone ringing ] Woman: Polaris night line. Easton: Hello? Hello. This is Phil Easton. Will you... Will you connect me with Paul Iberville'’s home immediately? Woman: I'’m sorry, sir, but we'’re unable to do that. But I will leave a message for him. Easton: Will you please tell him to get in touch with Phil Easton immediately? Tell him... Tell him Phil Easton has got to talk with him. Tell him... Tell him... It'’s important. Will you do that? Will you? Woman: Does Mr. Iberville have your number, sir? [ narrating ] Iberville... That was the guy Asa Lemar turned me over to at the studio. All this time, I'’d been thinking Lemar. Now it looked like Iberville'’s game. I had Jenny'’s story, I had Iberville'’s connection with the house on Highfield. I had the address of the two chicks. But I couldn'’t go to the cops. I'’d already been to them. Hi, are you Paycheck? Yeah yeah, I'’m Bill Paycheck. My goodness. -Come on in. What a cutie. -Very nice. [ narrating ] I'’d conned my way through the door. They thought I was a trick sent by Phil Easton. When I got inside, I danced around with them for a while. Then I got down to the nuts and bolts. I laid the story on '’em about the house on Highfield. And they dummied up. Well, what he told me was that you were up in a house on Highfield. And that you were... Showing a movie star a good time. [ chuckles ] And then a redheaded kid came in and there was a punch-out... And you guys took off. And I went up there. I found a locket in the swimming pool with that picture in it. [ giggles ] Mister, if this is some kind of a set-up, we'’re not buying it. Get out of here. -What about the picture, lady? -[ laughs ] You'’ve gotta be kidding. Our pictures are all over the place. That'’s how we make a living. Now why don'’t you take my advice and get out of here? All right. I know you got juice with the studio. I know they pulled you out of that house and gave you money to dummy-up. What you don'’t know... Pay attention, toots... We'’re talking about murder. Yeah, that redheaded kid got jerked out of that joint and dusted. Now that'’s gonna surface sooner or later. Mister, it'’s got nothing to do with us. We don'’t want to hear about it. Get outta here. What if I take my story to the cops, tough guy? Man, it'’s a good story. Maybe you should take it to the cops. In fact, maybe you should call them from here. Fair enough. Don'’t come back, mister. If you do, we'’ll have someone waiting for you. Look, toots, you may think you'’re safe now because you got a studio covering your tracks, but that'’ll hold till about Tuesday when this thing blows. Then there'’ll be somebody looking for you. [ door slides shut ] Dancer, you know what you'’re asking me to do? I'’ve been working for the studio for over 10 years... Give me somebody. Give me a name! Give me somebody in this studio that'’s got some juice! Give me the goods on one heavyweight! Come on, Dancer. You'’re putting me in a corner. I can'’t answer that! I'’m in a corner! It'’s coming down around me And there ain'’t nothing I can do about it! -You know what you'’re asking?! -You know what I know! I ain'’t never asked you for nothing before, but I'’m asking you now! This time, you give me somebody! [ narrating ] I knew him 10 years ago when he was a bad cop on the streets. I knew how his partner got killed. I sat on the info for years because too many lives were involved. I backed him into a corner, he gave me a name... Carol Banding, the chick I saw with Asa Lemar. He gave me some info on her. I didn'’t know whether it was gonna do me any good or not. Do you leave now or do I call someone to throw you out? Lady, I know you'’re head of business affairs. I also know you run with Asa Lemar. You have been for the last five years, that'’s how you got the job. I also know you keep a chick down in Laguna. She drives a red convertible. He'’d been with her for the last two years. Now do I call Lemar or do we talk? Personally, I don'’t care who you run with. I need information. Look, I told you, I don'’t know anything. I just work for the man. Yeah, you work for him and you sleep with him and you have been for five years. Lady, I told you, I need information! If I have to blow the whistle on you, I will! And I won'’t stop there! Now tell me about your bosses Iberville and Lemar. -How tight are they? -They'’re not tight at all! Well, then what the hell'’s Lemar keep him working there for? He don'’t like him! Does Iberville got the goods on Lemar? That'’s it. I hit on it, didn'’t I? Iberville'’s got Lemar nailed in some kind of way. Lady, it took ya a long time to get where you are. And I can bring you down with one phone call and I'’ll do it. Now answer me. -He... He'’s overextended. -What? I can'’t hear ya. He'’s overextended! Who'’s overextended? [ sighs ] Lemar. Lemar is overextended. That'’s what you wanted to hear, isn'’t it? That ain'’t enough! Who'’s he overextended with? How? What are you talking about? Lemar, he... He arranged for a line of credit. Up to $60 million... at U.S.D. But there was a stipulation in the deal that 30 million of that would be used for a Judd Hampton picture. Are you telling me that that'’s the only trouble Asa Lemar is in? I'’m gonna get to the bottom of it sooner or later. Lemar went to two other banks and he borrowed not as much money, but he made the same deal... That the lion'’s share would be used on a Judd Hampton picture. And if the audiences, for some reason, stop going to the Judd Hampton movies... Lemar is dead, ain'’t he? And the studio starts looking for a new boss. And that boss is Paul Iberville. -Ain'’t it? -Yes. Yeah. Now if I was Paul Iberville and I wanted to take over... I'’d be looking to bury Judd Hampton some way. -Wouldn'’t you? -Yes. All right. We both know Iberville'’s got the goods on Lemar. Why don'’t he close in for the kill? I don'’t know what you'’re talking about? Maybe you don'’t. Maybe he didn'’t tell you. Tell me what? No. I came here to get information, not to give it. What about me? We all live with ourselves, don'’t we? [ narrating ] The next morning I went downtown. I wanted to see if Herbie Quinlan'’s death was being investigated... No. I went through the files to see if either one of those broads had a past criminal record... No again. Or if they had, they'’d been wiped clean. [ phone ringing ] -Joe? - Hi, Charlie. Call that guy Janis down in D.C. And give me a run-down on them two chicks... No, we'’re gonna get to that later. I'’ve got some very bad news. Cow John called and he said there'’s two guys that have been watching the place all day. You'’ve got to get over there in a hurry, Joe. All right, just tell '’em to sit tight and don'’t do nothing. I'’ll come up the back way. - So long, kid. -Okay. Oh, Joe, I'’m glad you got here. Take it easy, John. Any change? They'’re still just sitting and waiting. John: They'’ve been sent up here before. Dancer: How do you figure it, Cow John? They'’re just sitting there all day long, they ain'’t done nothing? Maybe they'’re waiting for you. I don'’t understand. I don'’t either. Dancer: I don'’t understand how they found this place. Okay, Cow John, I gotta get Jenny out of here. I don'’t know which way those guys are gonna jump, but you take care of yourself. You take care of the kid. Okay. Thanks, pal. [ engine starts ] Ah. Jenny: Oh! Joe? Who are those people? Why do they want to kill me? I don'’t know, honey. Don'’t lie to me. I'’m not 14 years old! So help me, I don'’t know. All I know is I'’m trying to keep both of us alive till I can find out who killed your brother. Joe! Hang on now. Just hang on! [ Jenny gasps ] Oh! [ sobbing ] Where'’d they go, Joe? It'’s okay. They'’re gone. They'’re gone, honey. Joe, look. It'’s Cow John. Hey, John! What the hell happened? I didn'’t hear any shooting. I didn'’t shoot. I don'’t mean back at the ranch. I mean those two guys in the four-wheeler. They were down in the ravine. Didn'’t you see 'em? Two... I didn'’t see anything. I didn'’t see anybody anywhere. I saw a helicopter but, where'’d that go to? I don'’t even know where it came from. You come on over here, honey, and get up in back of me. Yeah, I know, Jenny. This thing is a lot more complicated and ugly than either one of us can even figure out. I just can'’t take you with me. I don'’t know where I'm going and I ain'’t sure I'’m coming out the other end. I'’ll send you back to Iowa if you want to go. But if they'’re looking for you, they'’ll find you there. And I damn sure don'’t trust the cops. It'’s your choice. [ horse neighs ] I'’ll go with Cow John. Okay. Joe... This time we'’re gonna do it my way. I know the horse isn'’t wired. What'’s this for? You just put it under a rock. And if you want us, you come and call. Just make sure you ain'’t followed. Wait a minute. Where are you gonna be? None of your business. '’Cause if anybody gets to you and squeezes, nobody knows. You want me to do a job, I'’m gonna do it right. Fair enough, John. Room service. Yes, I would like a rare steak and a salad, in about an hour. No, nothing else. Thank you. Don'’t tense up. I figured I'’d be half in the bag by the time you showed up, kid. Ain'’t you the movie star that likes to go out on the streets and play with two or three girls at the same time? I figured you'’d show 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning with a couple of henchmen coked out of your brains. And here it is, what? 8:00. I ain'’t looking at no movie star. I'’m looking at a scared kid. What'’s the matter? What is this? Blackmail? What do you want, money? Blackmail? Yeah. How am I gonna blackmail you? What have I got on you? Hm? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You'’re the one who said it, kid. What have I got on you? Huh? I don'’t know what you'’re talking about. You don'’t, huh? All right, I'’m gonna tell you. When I saw you the other day in your trailer, well, I didn'’t put all the cards on the table then. I'’m gonna do it now. That red-headed kid that you killed accidentally, he wound up in a phony car crash. And the pizza kid... You remember the pizza kid when you ran out of the house on Highfield he was staring at you? They threw him in front of my car. I killed him. And the cop who was working on the case wound up blown up in his own boat. You understand murder one, don'’t you? You ain'’t from that far back in the woods. I told you, I believe you. It was an accident. But you'’re gonna wind up behind the eight ball. I don'’t care about no confession. All I want to know is who told you to dummy-up? I'’ve been waiting. Waiting for the cops to come after me. Waiting for the girls to call me. Waiting for someone to blackmail me, waiting. But nobody, nothing. You'’re the only one who's come after me so far. Are you telling me, kid, that the studio ain'’t let you in on none of this? You haven'’t talked to Iberville? I don'’t even know who Iberville is. The only one I deal with is Asa Lemar. And you told Lemar? I tried to. I tried to explain it to him, but he wouldn'’t listen. He brushed it off like it wasn'’t important. Told me not to worry about it. "Don'’t worry about it." I don'’t... I don't know who to go to anymore. I don'’t know who to talk to. I'’m telling you, kid, when it comes down, and it will come down, you'’re the one that's gonna be holding the bag. Your friend Asa Lemar and that whole studio, they'’re gonna run for the hills. And that'’s gonna leave you. I believe your story. I'’d like to help you get out from under. [ whispered ] Okay. I was up there with those two girls. But I didn'’t know 'em. The studio set it up. I don'’t even know who did it. There was a note in my dressing room saying if you want to unwind tonight, a note and an address. Then a redheaded guy came through the door. He started yelling that one of the girls was his wife. He came at me... Started throwing punches. I swung at him, I swung at him once, and he went down. I swear to God, I only swung at him once. Did you check him out? Well, I was going to. And the girls told me to get out of there. They told me they'’d take care of everything. I mean, I knew the studio had hired them, so I ran out. And then I saw the pizza kid outside and I got even more scared and I kept running. Kid, you'’re sure you only hit him once? When he was going down, did he hit anything like a coffee table or something like that? No, no. I swear to god, I don'’t think I killed him. I don'’t know what happened to the red-haired kid. I don'’t know what happened to anybody. And the two girls told you to get out of there? If I was you, I wouldn'’t say nothing to nobody about nothing. I'’ll get in touch with you. I will unravel this. [ razor buzzing ] Talk to me. Look, you'’re not crazy. Look at that. Three injuries behind the head. This man was dead before his head even went through the windshield of that car. Hm-hm-hm. So how come it didn'’t show up in the autopsy? You tell me. But I'’ll stick by you in a court of law. Who killed him, Dancer? Forget it. Now wait a minute. Who do I tell what to? [ sighs ] Nothing. I can'’t prove nothing. Well, what do I do? You'’re a good guy. I'’m gonna give you some advice. Take it. Don'’t talk to the cops. Don'’t tell nobody nothing. Put the stiff back in the drawer, go out to dinner and forget it. And I owe you one. [ narrating ] Now I had it. Now I finally knew what happened that night on Highfield. Hampton had been telling the truth, The studio had left him hung out. I couldn'’t tell the cops. There was only one person I wanted to tell my story to: the man that wrote it. I made a couple of phone calls and found out he was still sitting on top of his empire. He invited me up. I was beginning to understand how the real big-leaguers worked. Mr. Dancer, you live in a fantasy world. The studios don'’t kill people. You can equate murder with the mafia, the criminals in the streets, but not with corporate structures. Whatever stories you may or may not have heard, to put together the fabric of this fantasy... Mr. Lemar, you got a murderer working for you. Paul Iberville. But then I ain'’t telling you nothing you don'’t know already. You know he wants to take over this studio. And he knows you'’re up to your eyeballs in debt. And if anything happens to your franchise, Judd Hampton, with all that money you got in his movies, the axe falls on you. Up to now I thought Iberville was holding all the cards, and I couldn'’t figure out why he didn'’t just blow the whistle on you and take over. But now I know. Go on. I find this quite intriguing. I will. Paul Iberville set up Judd Hampton. He hired the two girls to go up to the house on Highfield and show '’em a good time. He hired the redheaded kid to come in and start a fight. He hired the redheaded kid to take a punch and take a fall. He hired the two girls to tell Hampton to get out of there. Iberville told the redhead to play dead till everyone was sure that Hampton had split. What he didn'’t tell the redhead was that he hired another player, and that player was to make sure the redhead played dead for keeps. That was supposed to be the end of it. But it wasn'’t. Do you have a resolve for your story, Mr. Dancer? Try this... You had your bird dog watching your movie star Judd Hampton. He saw Hampton run out of that house up on Highfield and he went inside and he found a redheaded kid dead. And he called you and told you your boy was in trouble. So you made a couple of phone calls downtown to your friends in the police department and lo and behold, the redheaded kid turns up dead in a phony traffic accident. And that leaves you and Iberville. And since then, there'’s been a lot of killing and a lot of cleaning up. You'’re a very bright man, Mr. Dancer. You'’re good at your work and your mind fascinates me. I'’d like to see just how bright you are. I'’d like you to become part of Z.T.Y. As you'’re aware, we've been having problems lately with security matters. I'’m sure the board could justify a position as a security consultant. I'’m sure they could. The annual salary would be considerable. The hours would be pretty much your own. And there would be retirement benefits. Have you considered retirement, Mr. Dancer? You'’d better look to your own retirement, Mr. Lemar. Because I'’m not gonna stop till I bring you and Iberville down. Between the two of you, you'’re responsible for all the killing. Mr. Dancer. As I told you before, we don'’t kill people. Please give my offer considerable thought. I'’m available to you anytime you want to reach me. [ narrating ] The time was right. Somebody had to cop. There were too many people around with their mouths shut and the studio couldn'’t keep a lid on all of '’em. Phil Easton, the porno king, was the shakiest card in the deck. It was time for me to play it. I kept hearing Lemar'’s voice saying, "We don'’t kill people, Mr. Dancer." This wasn'’t a murder mystery I was working on. This was what this country had become... Cold-blooded killings in the corporate world. Impersonal machines. Guy'’s name is Phil Easton. He runs this joint. Yeah, your case is in there. Somebody killed him? Nah, it was an accident. -What time'’d they find him? -This morning. Could you tell me how he died? A massive coronary. The secretary found him naked in his office. I guess this guy Easton must have tried one young chick too many. Yeah. Or he made one phone call too many. Dancer: Don'’t hang up now. Phil Easton is dead. Did you hear me? I said, Phil Easton is dead. Are you there? Yes. Now look, honey, I know they paid you off and they told you everything was cool. Well, nothing is cool. They'’re covering their tracks and they'’re sweeping the slate clean. You'’re playing with your life now. What can I do? Where'’s your girlfriend? Is she there? Uh, she'’s at the beauty parlor. Call her. Tell her to come back home. Tell her, don'’t talk to anybody. When she gets in the house, just lock the door, don'’t call the cops. Don'’t call nobody. I'’m across town, I'll get there as fast as I can. Okay. [ narrating ] I was the only hope the chicks had of staying alive. And they were my only hope of nailing Iberville and the studio. It was a 30-minute drive. I made it in 20. No Jill, no girlfriend, no furniture. No nothing. Was she on the run? No. If she was running, would she have stopped to clean up the whole joint? The chick'’s not that smart. But she was gone. And not by her own hand. Hey, Jackie! Wait a minute. Hey, Jackie! Wait a minute! -I wanna talk... Hey, wait! -[ tires screeching] [ screams ] [ sobbing ] [ gunshots ] Stay down! Stay down! [ screaming ] Stay in the car! Stay in the car! [ gun clicks ] [ gunshots continue ] [ screams ] No! [ narrating ] There was no witnesses left. Judd Hampton'’s story couldn'’t prove nothing. There was no way to get to the man at the top. Don'’t worry, kid. Your sister'’s safe. She went back home. They killed everybody. In the street, you fight street. In the courtroom, you fight legal. In the jailhouse, they got joint law. In the big leagues, there ain'’t no law. I promised you I'’d get the guy who killed you. I'’m gonna do it. But I gotta do it their way. Mr. Lemar, é\Mr. Dancer. You'’ve reconsidered my offer? No. I'’ve reconsidered mine. Oh? You'’re right. You don'’t do any killing. Paul Iberville did all the killing. But I promised that pizza kid that I would get the man who murdered him. And if you don'’t do that for me, I'’ll bring down you and this whole studio. How do you propose to do that, if Paul Iberville did all the... In what way am I involved? Accessory after the fact. You went into that house on Highfield and you cleaned it up. You know you did. You'’re the one who called the cops and made a deal with '’em. And everything was supposed to be fine. But I started looking. And Iberville got tense and he started killing. And the more he killed, the more you cleaned up after him. And all that stuff with the helicopter with me and Jenny, that was you trying to get me to back off. Well, I just told you. Now you know. There'’s only one way I'’ll ever back off. There are no more witnesses left, Mr. Dancer. Yeah. He killed '’em all. But I proved it to myself. And so help me, I'’ll prove it to the feds if it takes me the rest of my life. I don'’t doubt that for a minute, Mr. Dancer. If you'’ll allow me to write the end of this scenario. [ door opens ] [ narrating ] A week later I found myself in the bar where Herbie Quinlan and I had our last drink. I hoisted one for Herbie. I hoisted one for the kid, Steve Burnell. Jenny was on her way back to Iowa. I hoisted one for her. [ football announcer speaking on TV ] Anchor: We bring you this late report. Paul Iberville, head of Polaris studios, has been killed in a plane crash. Initial reports indicate that air controllers lost contact with Iberville'’s private plane shortly after take-off earlier this evening. Searchers have now found the wreckage with Iberville'’s body inside. The plane apparently flew head-on into a mountain ridge. The cause of that crash now under investigation. Repeating, Polaris studios president Paul Iberville killed tonight in a plane crash. More details as they become available. We return now to our regular programming. [ narrating ] And I hoisted one for me because the big trade had been made. I knew Asa Lemar figured the slate was clean. What Asa Lemar didn'’t know was that I'’d always be there in the woodwork. That I'’d be there on every street without a light. That if I lived a day or for another 100 years, part of each day would be spent thinking about him. Trying to figure a way to nail the man who said, "Studios don'’t kill people." [ jazz music playing ]
