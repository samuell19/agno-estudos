All right, party animals, what are you doing out there anyway? Let's make some noise! Come on! Whoo! You're into that guy? I don't think so. Yes! Yes! Thank you! To us! Not taking shots anymore. To sisters! To sisters. Where did those come from? I didn't order another round. I did! No, no, I'm good with my beer. To us! You're crazy. One more time. All right, you go. Okay. Here we go. All right. What happened? Maybe I could come out and hang out with you in Sacramento for a while. Oh, yeah? Pretty please? I don't know. Say yes, say yes. Only if you let me win. Never! That was so good. That was super fun. Watch the road, ash. Good night! We need a taxi. Taxi? The less walking you have to do, the better. I'm walking fine. I am good. Let's just wait. Ashley! She's still in bed? Has she been doing this a lot? Non-stop since she moved back in. Well, she wants to come back to California with me. I'm sure she does. Libba, you think long and hard about that. There's a good junior college. I mean, we could get her enrolled in some classes. It'd be good for her, some responsibility. Come on, it'd... I miss her. It'd be fun. Good clean fun. She could use that. Um, I could totally have a baby. You serious? Seriously, I could get married and have, like, a couple kids. Okay. What kind of husband are you looking for? A biker? He doesn't have to be a biker, just something like that, you know? Someone with a few tattoos or something. Of course. Don't worry, I'm not going to get married before you. Oh, yeah? Why's that? Well, because we practiced your wedding so much when we were kids. Oh, my gosh, I forgot about that. Remember the... The cheesy tiara I wore? Oh, my god! "Bride to be!" Oh, my god. We wore that... You wore that... So many times. Yup, yup... -I was always the husband! -Hey, it was my wedding. Exactly! What exactly are you taking pictures of? The barn! Why do you always take pictures of such weird stuff? Because I am an artiste. Do I look pretty? Always. Thank you. Think I could be a model? I don't know, you'd have to be on time. Even if I'm a supermodel? Still got to be on time, ash. How much further till Sacramento? I don't know, I've lost track. So, how did you meet him? Uh, well, there's a veterinary practice up in the foothills that I go to every week. It's the same time, same day, and, uh, there was this really cute guy who would be jogging by. Cute shorts? Very cute, yeah. So, um, you know, we'd see each other all... Ash, can you help, please? Um, and then, one day, I noticed that he was limping, so, uh, I stopped. That was him totally trying to get you in his car to murder you. No, I think he just pulled a hamstring. You didn't know that. You didn't know him. He could totally have been a murderer. Decide for yourself. You'll meet him Saturday. All right, so, I am going to get you a notepad, and a calendar so you know when the payment for this is due. I can't believe they made you co-sign on this. It's not like it was that expensive. Ash, your credit sucks. You do know that every time you're even a day late on your payment, it lowers your score. Well, that's stupid. It just makes it harder. ...then you go the other way, and you've got San Francisco. I love it here. I mean, I love the trees and the river, and... I mean, it's California, duh? Who wouldn't want to be here? So, what type of work you looking for? I might know some people. Um, I don't know. I mean, I could be, like... Like, a model, or, you know, a waitress, or... Well, I would probably need, like, special training, but I could be, like, you know, like, the weather person on TV? Well, she's waitressed, and, uh, she worked with preschool kids. She was really good at that. That was fun. It was fun. So, uh, libba says you're thinking of junior college? Maybe. I mean, if I could do it. You can do it. She's always saying that. So... I think junior college is going to have wait till next semester... The classes start super early anyway. We can get you an alarm clock. There's some restaurants hiring, but I'd have to have a car to get there. I found this really cool used car, but, of course, they said that you would have to co-sign for it. Uh, well, you know, we could sit down and look at what the monthly would be, and look at your other bills, and see what it all looks like. Cool. I met a couple girls, and we're going out tonight. Oh. Want to come with? No, I've got to get up early to work. Sounds fun, though. It's good you're meeting people. Hey, doc. Aw, it's okay. Shh... It's okay, yeah... Thank you. Good girl. It's okay. Good girl. Can you hold that for a sec? Yup. Thanks. Come on. Good girl. It's okay. Mares don't usually reject their foals. When they do, it's rough. Oh, we have, um, the new beta kit with the new igc kit. With you? Yeah. These are the new beta kits. We've been selling a lot of them. We'll keep an eye on him for the next couple weeks. We should know by then if he's out of the woods. Great. Listen, sorry to have dragged you all the way out here. Oh, no, it's nice to see you out of the office, where every good vet belongs. So, uh, you're going to want to order more of those kits. Yeah, probably. All right, I'll see you next Friday. Yeah, have a great week. Bye. You got in kind of late last night, huh? It wasn't that bad. You were already asleep. Hey... Let's get Chinese. You payin'? Loan me the money. Come on, let's get Chinese. Please? You have no idea what it's like to be in my head! You, you're so perfect! So together, so organized! You moved here three months ago trying to turn your life around. You were going to get a job, you were going to pay your share of the rent... You want me to get a job? I can get a job no problem. Well, you know what, it must be a problem, ash, 'cause you don't have one! All right, you lie around here all day, you go out at night, partying at clubs and bars... You sound like mom. Well, maybe she had a point! Fine. I got offered a job. I can start tomorrow if I want. Come by and check on me if you're so worried. Hey, uh, I'm looking for Ashley? Thanks. Hey! You came! Oh, I'm so glad you came! I'm so glad you came. I wanted you to come see all this before you got all judgemental. And you think me seeing this would somehow improve my opinion? Oh, come on, it's not that bad. Are you going to stay and see me dance? No, Ashley. I'm going to go home and have a drink. Well, have a couple drinks here. They gave me, like, these coupon things. I have them somewhere. Seriously, I'm really good at this. I'm really good at it. I've been working at it all day. You should stay and see... Ash, do not let anyone touch you. I'm not doing lap dances! I'm just dancing, and you told me... You told me to get a job. I got a job, I'm really good at it. Come on, loosen up, have some fun! Ashley... Seriously, all I'm doing is dancing. Come on, please stay, please, please, please! I've got to go. Please stay. Come upstairs... Oh, come on... These are so good, libba. We ought to get you a show at the gallery. Yeah, they're part of a series I'm calling "the lost highway." Wow, your sister could be a model. Oh, yeah? Well, you should tell her that, 'cause she just became a stripper. Good money, bad lifestyle, but you can't talk her out of it. Every girl there has someone who tried to tell them it's a bad idea. What can I do? Just be normal, a safe haven. Let her figure it out on her own. Never a dull moment with Ashley. You okay? No. Is it bad? Yeah. Tell me. It's like I'm in a tunnel with dead bodies... Rotting animals... What's wrong with me? I don't know. Even when you were a little girl, you were... Either full of energy, could conquer the world, or... Couldn't do anything. I can't be anything. You know that's not true. I'm sorry, sissy. I wanted to be good for you. I did. Maybe we can get you some help. Help didn't help. I've had help. Well, maybe we can get you... A different kind of help. Okay? I don't know. I need a shower. Oh, man, I was gonna clean all that up. Uh-huh. So, I was thinking... Beauty school, or working with kids, 'cause I was actually good with them. Then there's always junior college. You think I could do it? Yeah, you can do any of those. I mean, just pick one and do it. I will. I really will. Wow, that, uh, must have been one miracle shower, huh? What do you mean? Well, just an hour ago, you couldn't function, and now, all of a sudden, the sky's the limit. What's your point? What do you think my point is? So, now I can't be happy unless I'm doing drugs? Ashley, what are you doing? If you don't remember, I've been like this my whole life! Ashley, clean this up! I don't have to stay here. I don't have to do what you tell me to do. You were supposed to be on my side! Ashley, get back here. Where the hell were you? You didn't come home last night. I was worried. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! No, Ashley, it's 9:00 A.M., I'm heading into an appointment now. I've got to go. I think they towed my car... And, I don't know, I think I'm still a little drunk. Aw, geez... Where are you? Yeah, I'll be right there. All right. Hello? Hello? I love you! I love you! What? Wow, I really needed that sleep. You know what I'm thinking about? I'm thinking about highlights. I think you and me need highlights in our hair at a beauty salon today... Ashley... Like, now. The salon's closed, Ashley. It's 7:00 at night. No way. I slept all day? Wow. What happened to my jewellery? I don't know. It's gone. Oh, god, well, I didn't take it. Really? You sure about that? Oh, come on, libba. I make more money than you do now. Like I need to steal your jewellery. I can buy whatever I want. Really? Well, hmm, have you paid for rent? Have you paid for the car-payment I co-signed on? Have you paid for the bed I co-signed on? That was your choice. I didn't make you do that. If you want money, I can give you money tonight. Really? You sure it hasn't gone up your nose, Ashley? You're just pissed because you're failing at turning me into you. I don't need this. I really don't. Then go. I'll come get my stuff tomorrow! Better hire a rent-a-cop, make sure I don't steal the rest of your crap! Well, I'm getting worried. It's been what, four months since she left? Yeah, she still won't talk to me. She talks to my mom, though, but I don't think she tells her what's really going on. What does she say? Oh, you know, that she's waitressing in Atlanta, has a boyfriend, everything's good. And what do you think? Everything's bad! Her friends say that there's drugs and shady people... Well, people make choices. Yeah, I guess they do. It's not your fault if you don't want to subsidize her party lifestyle. Got a hundred yards left. Loser cooks dinner tonight. No, David... How long was Ashley in jail? Three months. First offense. For just a gram of coke? Well, it turns out she wasn't very cooperative during the arrest. Have you talked with her? Yeah, just for a second. I don't know, she sounded okay. I'm going to go out and see her next week. Should be interesting. Well, the good thing is that my mom got her into an inpatient treatment center. Aside from her addictions, turns out Ashley is bipolar. Okay, then. Don't the two usually go hand in hand? Yeah, I guess. Looking back, it all makes sense. Last thing I remember, I was leaving, and then I woke up in some crappy apartment with a couple guys I didn't know... Had to have been a couple days. You blacked out? Or they drugged me, I don't know. Somebody said Frankie sold me. What happened then? Ashley? What happened then? Everything. We thought this was taken care of, but, evidently, your insurance needs an independent evaluation. Ashley? So, you're kicking me out? I don't even care. Why don't you just shoot me? I-I just talked to her last week. She knew I was flying out. Was she even competent to leave? There was a problem with her insurance. We told her she would have to move back home until we straightened it out. I left her in her room. She did this and then walked out the door. And-and you just let her? We didn't know till after. She needs her meds. You can't just stop taking them. It could spin her out of control. "Could?" What exactly has she been taking? It's a serotin re-uptake inhibitor. Basically, it balances out her highs and lows. It's powerful stuff. So, what's she likely to do? She'll crave the drugs she used before with an even greater intensity, but it won't help. Her brain chemistry is scrambled. She may not even know who she is. No, I-I don't think you get it. My sister was in rehab. She's bipolar, she's without her medication. No, I don't think you get it. I'm not sending cars out looking for your sister. I'm not even going to file a missing person report. What? What do you mean you're not going to file a missing persons? Your sister walked out of a treatment center where she was voluntarily committed. She's an adult. If she wants to go out on the street and use drugs, that's her deal. If she gets caught, then it's my deal. Got it? How may I help you, sir? So you guys knew last week that she left, and you didn't tell me? We thought that she'd be home by the time you arrived. We really did. This is not the first time that she has disappeared for a few days, gone off on some bender or something. She always comes dragging home a couple of days later. One time, she was black and blue all over, and she didn't even know how it happened. What? Nobody told me this! Okay... Okay, uh... What do we do? What do we do right now? The police don't care, the rehab center doesn't care. I mean, what the hell do we do? This is such a long shot. You got any other plans tonight, Chuck? No, I just mean that... She could be at a friend's... She's not at a friend's. She would've called. We would have heard from her. She's somewhere. I've got a bad feeling it's out here. Wait, pull up there. I want to go inside. Excuse me, um, my sister, Ashley, is missing. She may be in this part of town, she needs medication. It's possible that she came here. I'm sorry, but I can't help you. No, well, she's... She might be at risk. She's... She would have been here sometime last week. If we can just go through the last week of-of the new people? I'm sorry, but we can't do that. Can't or won't? Okay, you know what, I just need to know if she's been here so I can get her some help. Can't and won't, and I don't appreciate your attitude. Maybe your sister doesn't want to be found. Hello. It's like another world. Well, you be careful. I am. Chuck won't let me go out there alone at night. That's good. Do you think she's even still around? Maybe she's in a different town by now. I don't know. I'm not sure of anything. Hey... I really miss you. I think my phone was breaking up. Could you say that again? I said that I really miss you. That's what I thought you said. Good, 'cause, um, I really miss you, too. Well, when do you think you're going to be back? I don't know. Not sure. You know her disappearance is not your fault. That's what I tell myself. It's not. Look, you should get some sleep. Okay. I love you. I love you, too. Bye. I guess anywhere she might be, right? Or have been seen. The salvation army, a women's shelter, soup kitchens, hospitals, police stations, the morgue... I guess we'll just put up fliers everywhere. She left rehab on foot, and she... She can't be that far. Okay. What do you think? Oh, mom, this is great. Wow. Look at that picture. You know, I think I want to add something. Can you-can we do that? Sure, yeah. Here...here's a pen. Um, put "message to Ashley..." "This is your sister, libba, writing to you. "I love you, and I will never give up on you. "If you see this, please call mom, or call me collect anytime day or night." All right, you know, I think we just get out... Come on, come on, come on, come on. Whatcha need? Oh, uh, my- my sister is missing. Have you seen her? Come on, come on. Let me see. She's a good-looking girl. She do drugs? Yeah. Yeah, she was in rehab. You don't even want to know what happens to girls down here, especially a Princess like that. You know, pimps get 'em fast, and, uh, take 'em to the crack house, make 'em work. A girl's got to get her next high, and she pays for it on her back, with pretty much anybody who walks through the door. So... she's turned out. Forget about it, you know? Huh... He works for an insurance company. Not as an agent, mother. He's a v.P. Have you met his folks? Slow down, mom, okay? No, they're on the east coast. But you like him. I do. A lot. Okay, the fellow you want to talk to is lieutenant Maddox. He's with missing persons. That other guy you spoke to before... Yeah, sergeant Simmons, a real jerk. Don't get into with him. If he's at the desk, you tell him Maddox is expecting you. Okay. Sgt. Simmons is dealing with shootings, robberies, assaults, the usual. I'll Grant you he could have been more sympathetic. Yeah, once he learned Ashley was in drug rehab, he just basically said just to forget about it. He wouldn't even file a report. Your sister's an adult. She can go where she wants. She doesn't need to tell you or your parents, and if she's a drug user, she's probably gone to use drugs. Okay, she has psychological issues and drug abuse issues. She was in treatment. Okay, she has a problem, and she was getting help. Can you just, um... File a report? Please. Is there some kind of a database that we can get her into so if she shows up out of state we'll know it? That would be the ncic database. It's the national crime information center. We're going to have to file a missing person's report, and your sister's not missing. She's not? No, she might be missing to you, but she's not missing. You go out on the streets, and you look at the homeless, the addicts, and the crazies, and understand that, right now, the state is releasing people from mental health facilities. I'm sorry, but if your sister's to be found, you're going to have to do it yourself. Hi, uh... I'm still here. Thought you'd try your luck with someone else? Yeah, actually. I apologize, all right? I was just a little stressed. Accepted. Is there a place where I can put up a flier? A bulletin board or something... I'm afraid not. Not here. Miss? Miss! Hey... You seem like a good person, and I hope you find your sister, but let me tell you what goes on down here. We're a safe haven for women. Most of our residents are escaping abusive situations, husbands, boyfriends, pimps. Some of them have been beaten, raped, others are just down on their luck, but what they do know is that when they're here, they're safe, and that we protect them. We don't tell anybody who's here and who's not. I can see that. I'm sorry, I didn't know. Good luck. Put those fliers all over. Maybe she'll see one. Thanks. I'm talkin' to you, girl! All right, you wanna go, you go, but don't come back here! I'm not! Listen, nobody wants you, all right? And nobody care about you, girl! Nobody loves you but me! You gonna leave me, huh? Gonna leave me? Don't hurt me, Darnell. You came hurt. What! You're my top salesperson. I know that what makes you great at your job is exactly what's going to help you find your sister. You don't take no for an answer. I'm sorry, are you firing me? No. Libba, no, no. I'm just saying, other people have been covering your route. Your clients are going to get used to someone else... Yeah, I know, I know. I'm on it, don't worry. Okay. Because home office, they just look at the numbers. Of course. That movie was excellent. There were a lot of explosions. So I think I deserve a massage now. Oh, I see, I see. Poor you, huh? Yeah... Okay. I'll be right back. I'll be quick. Hello. Is this libba? Uh, yeah, who's this? This is about your sister. Have you seen her? What's left of her. She's dead. Have a nice night. Hey, what happened? What is wrong with people? They think this is funny? My sister could be dead, and they think this is funny? Maybe it's time you took your number off the fliers. No. No, someone will call, and I will be here for it. Excuse me. Have you seen this girl? I don't think I've seen her. Well, she may not look just like this anymore. You think? Not if she's around here. Can't sleep? Nope. Could I have done anything different? Mom... You didn't know. I think her illness progressed as she got older. When she was in California with me, it's like she didn't have an off switch. What does that mean? Well, we'd go out for a couple drinks, she'd have six. We'd go out dancing, she would keep on going until everybody dropped, and then she would just stay in bed for the next two, three days. Everything was dark and hopeless. That's the bipolar. Yeah, I guess it's pretty classic. I've got to go back to Sacramento, or I'm going to lose my job. I'm happy about your David. I'm happy about him, too, mom. He didn't bargain for any of this, but he's holding on pretty good. Yeah, it's a vaccine, it's intra-nasal. Piglets get it anywhere from one to three days after birth. Uh, yeah, no, it's very effective for bordetella, I think it's first-line... This is a nice surprise. Hey. I thought i'd take you out to lunch. Oh... No, honey, I can't. Uh, really. Uh... I kind of wanted to talk to you about something. Uh, well, i'm-I'm swamped. I can't. We need to talk. I've blown it, haven't I? Just... just tell me now. Well, it seems like you've put libba on the back burner for a while now. And I've put you on the back burner, too. Well, maybe we just need to shake things up a little bit. Like how? I thought about a weekend away, and then I thought about getting a dog, and then I thought, um, why not just get married? What? I said... No, I... I heard you. Oh, my god. Did i- did I say something wrong? No! No, no... It's just this isn't the reaction that I had in mind. This is not the proposal I had in mind! I can rephrase it... No, shut up. It was perfect. You think you can lift my wallet? I want my money, bitch! Yeah, I love it. Finally. Well, you got a little sunshine going on, I like it. Do you have a date? Uh, no, one step at a time. What are you calling this step? An engagement. Date and a ring. Get 'em. Have you told your mom? No, not yet... Oh, gosh, she's going to want a big wedding. She's going to want a big wedding? Funny. Hey, this is libba. Okay. Thank you. That was the, uh, the county coroner's office. Here. In Sacramento? They-they've found a body. It might be Ashley's. Oh, libba, I'm so sorry. No, we don't know for sure. It's just, they found a body in a dumpster, burned. I-I'll come with you. I'm-I'm okay. Height and weight approximately the same, and there is a tattoo, but I just can't make it out. She was in a fire? Uh, not exactly. The victim was tied hand and foot, put in a dumpster, then set on fire. You okay? I'm fine. Okay. She's pretty well unrecognizable, but you may be able to identify the tattoo. I think that's all you'll need to see for now. That's not Ashley. I used to believe in a goodness, that people are good, but now when I see one of those bumper stickers that says "practice random acts of kindness," it pisses me off. Whoa. No, I'm serious. That girl in the morgue was someone's daughter, someone else's sister, someone's loved one. They could still be looking for her. When we were talking the other day, about how we can help other people going through this? I said you should do something about it. If I start something, are you in? Start a what? A place, you know, one place where people can go to get help, where whatever it is I'm learning can be shared. Of course I'm in. I'd have to hear about it all the time anyways. Oh, yeah. You said we were going to go camping! We are! But in our backyard. There's a fence around it. Bears can still climb. That's true, so we better turn off our flashlights. Now he can't see us? Nope. He can see you! You're gonna wish there was a bear after I'm done with you! ♪ Long day ♪ on the corner ♪ long day ♪ staying on the street ♪ long time ♪ since the phone rang I don't know where else she would have gone. I mean, there's what, L.A., Seattle, Sacramento? Oh, and I've got a list of everyone that she knew, somewhere in here, and everyone that she worked for. They all have my number. I've given them fliers. They all said they haven't talked to her. They don't know where she is. She's here, I know it. How long do you plan to keep doing this? What, are you done? You've given up? That's not the point, libba. We've passed the fliers around, we've answered the phones... Oh, and we want our number off the flier. 2:00 in the morning, the phone rings, it's an idiot on the other end, laughing. Okay, fine. Fine then, um, we'll get another phone line, okay? That's the answer, right? I mean, I'm just, I'm learning as I go here. The greater point is, libba, that... Maybe she wants to be on drugs. Maybe she's seen that flier, and she just couldn't care less. I don't think a person with drug problems makes rational choices, especially when they're bipolar, okay? Yeah, and while, yes, there's a possibility that she just loves living on the street with the bums and the scum, I don't think so. She knows where we live. What does that mean? It means we're exhausted. You're exhausted? Yes. My job is hanging by a thread, my fiance is wondering what the hell is going on with me. I am going into debt flying back and forth from Sacramento, and you're exhausted? Libba, stop it! You've got to stop this. Stop this! Libba! Look, there is a point... There's a point... Honey! I haven't stopped loving her, I haven't stopped missing her, but I can't do this anymore! I can't... I can't-i can't deal with the not knowing anymore! Then you're excused. All right, so go back to your barbecues and your- your bridge games, or whatever the hell else it is you need to go and do! Because you just lost two daughters! What the hell's going on? My mom has decided to give up looking for Ashley, and wants me to accept reality. Okay, well, well, that's where she's at, you know, which is maybe the beginning of closure, for her, but then there's you, right? I have to tell you something. When, uh... When I was a little girl, I had this friend, and there were some weekends where, um... You know, my mom was divorced, so there were, uh... You know, if she ever had to go somewhere, we would just stay at this friend's house, and, you know, Ashley, she was just a little girl, so she would come, too. One night, um... I got out of bed and went over to where Ashley was sleeping, and... The door was open, and... There was... There was this man standing over her, and he was... And then he turned and he looked right at me, and I just ran away... I didn't-i didn't protect her, David. I... I was her sister and I didn't protect her! And the father of your friend, where is he now? He's dead. You know there's not necessarily a connection between what happened to Ashley and her mental problems and addictions. It doesn't mean there isn't. You were just a kid, libba. I know. I'm not now. You told me you were never going to give up on your sister. Moment of truth? Wallow in something you can't do anything about, or get your butt up and get moving. I really hate you. And I really know you. I got a message while you were out saying you'd come up with a name for this thing we're starting. What is it? "Outpost for hope?" Perfect. Hey, babe. You okay? I need some medicine. I know. Me too. Greg bring anything? Yeah. Sorta. I got nothing to pay him with, babe. I don't feel good. My head's kind of like... soggy. I know. I know it's hard. Just go in there and talk to him. Take care of us. Make us both feel good again. Please? Okay, guys, want to come see this? Yeah. Okay, now, I'm not sure if it's going to open, but since it's the first time, I thought we should all be here. Yeah, yeah, yeah, awesome. Is our phone plugged in? Yes... Tyler, this is incredible. Thanks. You done good, kid. Well, she is your mom. How long can she stay mad for? Ugh, who knows? I was totally wrong, I said it. What more can I do? Hey, can I play? So, I've been thinking about our engagement. I mean, how am I supposed to get married when my sister is missing? I don't know, can you? I've thought about my wedding since I was five. We should just do it. My sister's missing, my mom's not returning my calls. We should just elope. Like, go to Vegas and just do it. Are you serious? I don't need a big wedding. All I need is you. Marquita, hey. Did you get my message? Yeah, no, we're heading there right now. We should be there by midnight. Yeah, you're the only one that knows. Yeah? Okay, cool. Love you. She'll be there tomorrow by noon. Can you wait? I don't know. Another night as a single guy? Could be pretty rough. Oh, my god! Oh, my god, you're here! Oh, congratulations. Oh, my gosh. You look so beautiful. No, it's a rental. It's the only one that fit me. I don't know... It's great. I'm so glad you waited for me. I'm just going to be a sec, okay? Don't hate me. Okay... Mom... Honey... I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry! I can't believe you're here. You look so beautiful. No, I don't! You do, you do. I don't, it's a rental. What did... Mom... Where did you find that? On your bureau. Oh, my god! "Bride to be." Okay, yeah. Oh, very tasteful. How do I look? Gorgeous. Aw... And do you, libba, take David to be your lawfully wedded husband, to love and to Cherish, in sickness and in health, as long as you both shall live? I do. I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. Hey! No, I understand, but you will get more help from them if you are just unemotional. Okay. All right, well, uh, just keep us posted, okay? Our thoughts and prayers are with you. Bye. Her son. Went to a party and never came home. This is getting intense. You know what, let's just, uh, let's go get some lunch. I'll get it, I'll get it. Just, uh, can you grab me a Turkey burger? Where's the phone? Outpost for hope. Yeah, this is libba. It's extremely frustrating, I know, and how long has he been missing now? Oh, okay, um, and no one has seen him anywhere? You've called his friends, and... Okay. I mean, these people, they keep calling. This girl called yesterday. She's 19 years old, mom didn't come home from work. The police, they won't help. Isn't that their job? Isn't that what they're supposed to do? Yeah, you'd think. You know, I'm really happy you're an advocate. It's great, and I'll support it. I may not be happy that you're gone so much. How many trips have you made to Oregon looking for your sister? A lot. So, are you saying I've made too many? Or we can't afford it? I should stop? No, I didn't say any of those things. Okay, well, what's your point, then? Well, my point is that it's not about the money. I miss you when you're gone. I'm beginning to miss you while you're here now, too. Hey... We're married. This is the here and now. I know, i-I'm sorry. You're right. If nothing happens this trip, I'll cut back, okay? Lots of times, the fliers will still be up. But each of these places gets checked once a month? Right. Chuck and I will go there three or four times every Saturday. Um, and what about the phone calls? The usual creeps, although that's dropped off the last few months. Wait, there was this interesting ambulance guy just called. They picked up someone months ago. There was no I.D. You want to check this out? Yeah. This must have been about maybe five-six months ago. An auto versus pedestrian, a hit and run. She had no I.D., she had a concussion, broken arm, and partial internals, but a couple weeks ago, I saw one of those fliers again, and, for some reason, I looked at it closer. She... She just seemed familiar. What hospital did you take her to? We take all the indigents to county. It may not have been your sister, but I think I heard one of the bystanders, a street person, say the name "Ashley." I just can't be certain. Okay, where exactly did you pick her up? Hey. Have you seen this woman? Uh-uh. No. Excuse me, have you seen her? Yeah, I seen her. She hangs at the store, but usually by the basketball house. It's up there, a few blocks, but you don't want to go there. Bad place, bad people. Okay. Thank you. 'Sup? $50. M-My sister's missing and someone heard she was in here. Get lost. No, no, no, come back. I'm not leaving! Face the wall. I said, turn around! I've got to check you. Please. Please, please, please I-I just got to find my sister. Nothing personal. So, what's up? Um, my-my sister, is she here? Nope. No, I need to see. I need to see, please, just let me see! Are you stupid? Yeah, I guess I'm stupid. Okay. Okay. Have a look around. It's okay. I got your back. Go ahead. Go ahead. Ashley? She's not here, right? I'm sorry, someone said that they saw her here. Someone said... What did you think? You thought you were going to come into a place like this, your sister was going to see you and be all happy? She's going to go with you? Can I offer you a pipe? First one's always free. No thanks. I unplugged the phone... On the desk. I don't know if I can do this anymore. Remember her? That woman in Washington? Her daughter moved out, they talked every day, and then the calls just stopped? Right. Bellingham. That was her daughter? That police photo was how they found her. Floating in a river, stabbed over and over. Geez, I'm sorry. I thought we'd be, like, helping people. There are just so many, and how do they end? Do they end like this? Yeah, some of them do. How was her mother? She thanked me...Us. Said no one else cared. You said it was up to me if I kept working or not. Right, right, and it's fine if you quit your job. I just thought that meant... What, that I'd hang at the club on Saturdays? What, I'd start playing tennis? I don't know, something. Something that we could do together. I mean, it certainly wouldn't hurt my job if you'd socialize with a few of the other wives. David, I've done that. All right, I've tried to talk to them about what it is I'm working on, and their eyes glaze over, and they excuse themselves from my presence. They're not bad people, libba. I didn't say they were bad people. You write the governor and his wife? I wrote his wife and copied the governor. And they are going to blow a gasket at the police department when they get a letter from the governor. Good. Maybe they'll start to give a damn. Tyler, would you... Um, I-I think you should talk to our director, libba Phillips. Could you hold on a second? Her name is Sally rinnel, adelphi, Maryland. Her 18 year-old daughter is missing. She's a wreck. Here. Sally, this is libba. What's your daughter's name? Janie. Janie Christine rinnel. And how long has she been missing? Three days ago. She has seizures, is learning disabled. I-I found her book school bag outside of her bedroom window, and now I'm really scared. Okay, just calm down, okay? Just take a deep breath. We're going to get through this. I can get a flier composed today. When are the pictures coming? Sally has a friend who can scan and e-mail them. Caitlin Jones. Her organization is Maryland missing. She said if they get fliers tonight, volunteers can get them out in the morning. Okay, and I'm drafting the letter to the police chief. We've got to go at them on all sides here, all right? Family, media, Doe network, Maryland missing... Outpost for hope. Outpost for hope. Hi. They got away with not listing Ashley as missing, not caring that she disappeared. It's not going to happen again. I know this isn't what you signed on for. Not even close. You were looking for your sister. I understood that. Now you're just trying to take on the world. I'm still looking for my sister. Really? I wonder how much you and Ashley have in common. What does that mean? It means she was always running away from responsibility, from the real world, and that's what you're doing, except what you're running away from is me, and from our marriage, or what's left of it. I'm not running away from anything. You don't think that there are times when that phone rings that I wish it was because they had her in some morgue in some godforsaken place? You know, at least it would be over. At least I'd know. You think this is the life I want? Yeah, well... I hope you find her. So, is it, um, dangerous for me to show up at the station? Chief gets a letter from the governor. Everyone gets chewed out down the line, myself included, and even though it violates policy, we are now filing a missing person's report on Ashley. She will be eligible for the ncic database. Thank you. Don't thank me. You guys got this done. One more thing, and you're not hearing this from me. Last year, your sister was picked up here on an open container charge, released in 24 hours. Are you kidding me? No. Twice a month, we've been calling, handing out fliers, been stone-walled, and you guys actually had her in custody? Now, I know "I'm sorry" doesn't cut it. So, who do I sue, huh? Who the hell do I sue? This is unreal... Libba, no one. Keep your goal in mind, bringing Ashley home. Oh, and congratulations on outpost for hope. It's needed. I've already directed a few families there that we couldn't help. Let's go inside. H-Hello? Sissy? Ashley? Ashley, is that you? It's me, sissy. I love you. I love you, too. Where are you? I'm in Olympia. I'm eight months pregnant. I think I need help. Are you there? Sissy? I'm here... I'm here. Come get me, please? Okay. Hey, sissy. Hi. I brought her here a couple months ago. She was living on the street, so I, uh... you know. I don't know how to thank you. Is there something I can do for you? Oh, no, ma'am, that's all right. She was in a bad spot. I saw this at the bus station. I couldn't believe it. I gave it to Ashley and she called you right away. Let's go home. She don't have much, but it's all there. Thank you. Thank you so much. Bye. Take care of yourself now. You came to get me. You always come to get me. I was worried you were dead! I was-i was in morgues! I saw... I saw dead bodies, Ashley! I don't know... A-At night, were you safe? I... And there's so many missing, ash, you have no idea! Why didn't you call me? Huh? Why didn't you call me! I didn't want you to see me like that. I thought I'd wait until I got better. But I never got better. Not matter what, I love you, okay? No matter what. I will always be there for you, okay? Do you understand this? I know. She's really thin. I-I don't think I've ever seen someone so pregnant that skinny, but I think she's healthy, she's... she's healthy. Well, um, how's... How's her mental state? She doesn't remember how, um, how she left Oregon and how she got to Washington. Was she using drugs? Is she drinking? No, she says she hasn't been using or drinking since she's been pregnant. We can only hope she's telling the truth. Well, I checked her hands, and there's no pipe burns, so, I mean, at least we know she hasn't been smoking crack. I have to see her. Okay. I'll turn off the lights. My baby's back... Oh, mom. Mom... I'm so sorry. Oh, god, no, no, no, no, don't be sorry. Honey, don't be sorry. Oh, god, no. Hi, dad. I am so sorry. We didn't know. You needed our help, and we were so... So stupid. No, you weren't stupid. I... I just feel like I wrecked everybody's lives. No, you didn't, honey, you didn't. I missed libba's wedding. Aw... She was so beautiful. Sorry, something doesn't feel right. I think I have to go to the bathroom. Oh, okay. Sorry. Here, I'll help you. Wait, wait... Here you go, here you go. Thanks. I think something's wrong! So, he's completely healthy, no signs of any problems. He's almost six pounds. Hey. Hey... Hey, sweetie. Say hi to your grandson. Hello, grandson. Isn't he the most beautiful creature you've ever seen on this planet? You want to hold him? Sure. Here you go. He's so little. Come here. Here you go. Oh, there we go. Okay... good boy. I think I'm going to call him Jake. That's a fine name. Are you a Jake? If it was a girl, I totally would have named it libba. Sure. What do you think? Yeah, you're a Jake. Yeah... What do you think, Chuck? Jake works for me. Predators and serial killers count on the fact that the marginalized, the homeless, and their children make the easiest victims. Outpost for hope is focusing our efforts on what we call "kids off the grid," the unaccounted for infants and children of the unreported missing and lost persons... Uh, I'm so sorry. My phone's vibrating. It's-it's only for emergencies. I'm really sorry. Okay, um, I'm going to change the direction of this presentation. If I can find it... Uh... here it is. This is Janie rinnel. She, uh, she just disappeared four months ago after school one day. She has learning disabilities and is innocent enough to believe anything anyone tells her. That text was from Caitlin Jones at Maryland missing. Janie was found today and she's going to be returned to her mother. I had found my purpose in life, but it came at a cost. David and I separated, then divorced. Ashley was doing much better, getting treatment, back to her old self, she even got a job. I'm going to work. Bye, buddy. Bye, Jake. You be good for grandma, okay? You gonna be a good boy for grandma? Yeah? Okay, mama's gonna sell just for you today. Know what time you'll be back today? I don't know. I'll call you. I just wanted to know... Yeah, I know. His name's Tom. He wants domestic, low mileage, leather. Nav? He didn't say. That sebring just came in? Yeah. Go get 'em, kiddo. How you doing today, sir? I'm Ashley. -Nice to meet you. -Tom, right? That's right. I think I have what you're looking for. One owner, dealership serviced, has all its records. It's in great shape. Ash... Great work this week. Man, these guys, they can't say no to you. Thanks, Toby. Yeah. So, a few of us are going by the shanty cove for a cocktail, you want to join? I can't. My kid. Oh, yeah, right. Okay, well, too bad. Next time. Oh, can you lock up? Yeah. No, she's a no-go. Ashley, what the... Michelle, she's gone. One more time... There's grandma. So, who walked first, me or Ashley? Ashley. Ah, surprise, surprise. See, I told you, you got it in you. I know. Do you want to go on the swings? Want to go on the swings? Are you happy now? No? I'm going to give you kisses. Kisses. I'm going to do it. I'm going to give you kisses, yes, I am. I'm going to give you kisses. My heart broke when Stephanie vanished. Outpost for hope has given me hope. Thank you for the work you are doing. My elderly father was missing for three years. My daughter has been found. She is currently getting treatment. Thank you for helping me find Victoria. Just knowing she's alive is a prayer answered. Thanks to you and everyone you work with.
