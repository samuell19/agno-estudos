The delayed express from Hamburg is arriving at Platform 2. Deutschland, Deutschland uber alles, Doggie. The son-of-a-bitch! You've seen it! Yes? It's the kids... You won't catch them anyway. Pawel's won! Pawel's won! Hello? Anybody there? - Co... co... cool, eh? - Szymek. I knew you'd come. I've just arrived... and been hanging around. It's been twenty years. Eleven. I was in Hamburg. Like I thought. You can't sleep, either? I can. Why? This is where I hang-out. I don't play in the orchestra any more... - I've quit music. - I don't play either. I remaster old records, tapes... Pawel, are you scared? Scared of what? This clay is found only in the tunnel. Now ask me why I go there. O.K. Szymek. Why do you go there? Why, it was an accident. So, why didn't they find him, then? There was an explosion, but he was never found. Every day someone disappears without a trace. Not even a shoe or a finger. Nothing. Dawid visits you too? Stop it! Dawid's dead. So what? He thinks it's me who betrayed him. But you know it's not true. Why, those were kids' pledges. You say a lot of things when you're 13. No, no, no, it's not that. We swore for real. Remember on what? No. Move on! Move on! Go on! Szymon Palta, Piotr Korolewski, Pawel Heller. Pawel, Piotr and Szymek. Fine fireworks, no? Pity it all ended that way, eh? I didn't know... What? Nothing... Don't you get it? You all have to answer for a serious crime! Headmaster, I am conducting the investigation. There was a girl with you... Elka Bereda. She was close to you, right? Pawel? Wasn't she? You remember what she was wearing? Piotr? Answer, moron! Szymek, what was she wearing the last time she was with you? Well? Well? A dress... A red one. A red dress. Like this? Take a good look. Is this a scrap of her dress? Have they found her, Miss? Not yet. But we'll find her. No one disappears without a trace. Have they found Dawid? - I got it! I got the son-of-a-bitch! - Show me! Show me what it looks like! Jesus! What a whale! Co... co... cool, no? Milk and honey! Milk and honey! Cross the water to see a miracle! Milk and honey! Milk and honey! Cross the water to see a miracle! You want some? Thanks. - What did you do... - Lady... ...with my daughter?! What did you do with my child?! No! No! No! No! No! Calm down, please! - You can't come in here. - We'll find her for sure. Dawid can hear you. They both can... every word... Hey, hey you there! Practice! - You stay here. - What are you doing? When they play, they do not plot! It always works. Number 3. This is milk... And this is honey. It's on Track 5. Cut it off It will be fine. Why don't you fix it, dammit?! Why does the same gear work perfectly well in Hamburg, but screws up here?! Betrayal! Betrayal is a terrible thing, my dear little flowers. It's a deadly sin. For which we'll have to repent Throughout eternity! With no chance of redemption. Don't make yourselves easy prey for Satan! Beware of betrayal. Remember this all your life or at least throughout vacation. Hey, Weiser, why don't you go to religion classes with us? The little yid won't talk to us! - Get the yid! - Let him have it! Leave him! Leave him alone! Fuckin' Jew! She's the same. Did you see the marks on his hand? What were they? How should I know? Looked like snakebites. Do you think he keeps snakes? - This may be contagious! - Oh, come on... Jesus Christ! My ass! What a mess! Co... co... cool, eh? How could it ever happen? It's the heat. When it's hot, they say... Don't be stupid! They've been poisoned... Szymek? Don't go in there! Szymek, what's up? - I did... didn't tell a soul. - What're you doing here? My heart! He wanted to stop my heart! I betrayed nobody! Promise me you'll tell him! He trusted you. He always trusted you... I didn't tell anynobody. He's coming! He's here. Pawel, my God! He's coming! God! Are you Szymek's relative? A friend. He had no friends. We went to school together. Which of them are you? What time does to people. I lent him an atlas once. - May I take it back? - Of course. What? They burned her dress. Yes, but only a scrap? Why did you do it? Where? Ask him where they burned it? Didn't Piotr tell you? I want to hear it from you. - On a bonfire. - Show us where?! Precisely! Here's the river and the railroad track. Where was it? I'm not sure. I'm all confused. He's lying. They all are! Where did you hide the bodies of Weiser and Elka? - Dear colleague! - There were no bodies! No bodies? No blood? Nothing? Where did you bury them?! Mr. Kolota! He's only a child. He'll swing anyway. Milk and honey... What're you waiting for?! Do your thing, Nazi! Pawel, are you crazy? Jesus! Oh God! This is real! Real! Show me! Stick them up! I got it! Where did he get it? Co... co... cool, eh? - They do it better in the movies. - Great, let's go to the movies! - You'll stink. - It doesn't stink any more! Yes, it does. I can see you. Shut up! - I'm going for a piss. - Cool... me too! My ass! What a mess! Oh, my ass! Jesus! - Going to play Doc and Nurses. - Shut up! What're they doing? I want to see. Piotr? It's me, Pawel Heller. Remember me? I am back in Poland. I'd like to see you. How about tomorrow night? ...Perfect. Where? Let me put it down. ...27. Good. I'm coming on the afternoon train... See you. You 're such a child. Want some orangeade? I saw you on the runway. Well? Did you like it? We know where a dead cow is. Want to come along? Little kids... And you an adult, because you're seeing Dawid? Dawid can do anything. He's a philosopher. You're so stupid. I've stolen it from my sister. Want some? - Red's the best. - But don't tell anyone. I'll tell Dawid! He knows everything! Even what you're thinking and what's gonna happen. 121... 122... 123. Spying on us? You may come along if you like. He doesn't mind. Dawid! Wait. You believe in life after death? Of course I do. Good. Swear never to tell a soul what I'm going to show you... ...or what we're talking about, or what's gonna happen. And if you betray me, you die with no chance for the afterlife. You'll be nothing. A lump of shit. I swear. Scared? Because I am. Protect your eyes, and you'll see better. Cool it. It's not the end of the world yet. 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7 Dreaming? I don't remember... Fan-fucking-tastic! We're alive? - And Dawid? - That fatso, right? No, that's Szymek. Oh yes, Szymek. That's right. A little dopey and a sad sack. A heart attack is quite normal at our age And you smoke, son. ...I don't. I banned it from my office. You smoke, You get the fuck out. My wife hates me to smoke. Wait a minute. You are trying to tell me you don't remember Dawid? Like lots of other things. But I remember what my wife says when I come home late. Szymek claimed that Dawid was back and kept haunting him. He died on the 22nd, the anniversary of our explosion. So what? A visitation from the grave? The magical date of the 22nd, a levitation trick... - Dawid really did levitate. - Come on! He was having us on. A smart kid, him? They've never found him. Why don't you ask Elka? She was in the tunnel too, They didn't find him, but they found her. Sorry, I can't drink this. Excuse me. I was five years in jail in the commie times, they injured my kidney... I took to drink, went on the wagon, got cured... Good enough for you?! You come to me with an old story, and claim it's so important! I want to know what really happened. What did he need us for? Why did he mix us up in his affairs? Just to leave unanswered questions for years? What did he want from us? Why don't you answer me? You scared? For God's sake, Pawel... It wasn't me who squealed... or betrayed... Nor did Szymek. Go now... It was a huge box. Sixteen records. I don't know the title. The first letter is all that's left. Must've been torn off, accidentally or on purpose On purpose, I think. How should I know who I bought it from? Lots of people come here to buy or to sell... Maybe you remember if it was a man or a woman? At least that. It means a lot to me. It's part of my life. Everything around is part of someone's life. See these, for example. The Germans took them from the Jews on their way to the camps. Or maybe the militia later, not the Germans. Who knows? This is Silesia, a magical place God has forgotten. Here's a beauty, quite old. Whoever wore them could not have been happy, huh? So, you don't remember a thing? Take a look, please. Could have been him? - How old are they now? - Hmmm... as old as me. How about that armchair? They say Goering used to sit in it. W-e-i-s-e-r Weiser. - Weiser. - Weiser. Someone's been here and asked me the same... thing. But it wasn't you. I think so too. A name like this is hard to forget, right? Weiser. You're right. But not in our files. What? But you said you remember. I remember someone asking about him. Wait a minute. My ass! What a mess! Hot here, isn't it? - He used to live at 3 Sanocka St. - You can't come in here. A small bungalow, that. - Sanocka St. - 3. He never lived there, sir. The house is no more. So... what are you trying to say? There'd be some trace if he'd lived there. Must be a mistake. - 3 Sanocka St. - Right. And you mean he never existed? I don't know that... But... we must leave. I'm asking a simple question! Has Dawid Weiser ever existed or not?! Is that so strange? Dawid! Are you lost? Yes. Come or we'll be late. My daughter Rachel. Say hello. I remember going into the tunnel with him. And then... nothing. A blank. I was found unconscious in the bushes. That's all. I got something for you. Rudolf Jonas. He went mad, you know... Lost in the mountains. His body was never found. ...I didn't know. And Weiser? Weiser what? A funny boy he was, right? I had a crush on him... And on you too... Once, I dreamed we were both standing in the water. I kissed you on the cheek... while Dawid looked on from the tunnel. That's what happened. Maybe... I don't remember. This is milk... and this is honey... Look in the water See a miracle. It's funny when you're a kid, isn't it? I was supposed to go with him, not you. Rachel's waiting. Don't see me off. - Elka was there with you, right? - Yes. They always went together. Is that bothering you? No... why? Tell me... were you jealous? Weren't you jealous of Dawid? No... If I only work for myself, what will become of me? If not now, when? Who's there? He must learn his lesson. Tell them. - There's no one there. - Tell them! - I must learn my lesson. - That's right! He must learn his lesson! Tell them why. I must learn my lesson or I end up in the garbage dump. Like your father... Right?! Like my father. Louder! - I must learn my lesson. - Or?! - Or end up in the garbage dump. - Like who? - Like my father. - And who else? My mother. Are you shooting or not? Too scared to shoot. - Everyone's scared of something. - But not Dawid... Maybe scared of the night lessons... Bring the picture. What's he talking about? A ricochet! You saw it yourself... 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119 I can't. I want you to help me. I start off soon. What's it gonna be? You must learn your lesson first. Or I end up in the garbage dump? So I must learn my lesson or end up in the garbage dump. 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120. Pawel, are you coming with me? You alone? They wouldn't let me see you, little flower. Oh, those people. They make you look like criminals. Tastes good? Things don't look good. Dawid's grandpa has died, you know? Terrible. That's why you have to tell the whole truth. I can't. Lying is a terrible sin, my child. - But I swore to him. - Who? Weiser. Oh, dammit! Wouldn't you like to tell God the whole truth? As in confession. You'll be absolved, and you'll have some peace. So cross yourself and let's begin. On my knees? No need. Open up your soul and tell nothing but the truth, okay? But only to you, Father. And to Almighty God. Take the bags out of the basement! D' you think today is the day? It's got to happen. Our Father, Thou art in heaven Holy be Thy name Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done On earth as well as in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread Come. You'll rot in jail, moron! You even lied to the priest. - Why, the priest mustn't... - Okay, okay! All you tell is bullshit! No sense or logic. It was a confession... Only to him. And to Almighty God. Bullshit! Tell the truth and all will be well. What did you do with them?! Elka! Ready?! Yes, it's set! Tell him to give a signal! What? Connect them? Not yet! Not yet! He's coming back! Just hold on to your heart! - WHAM! - WHAM! Let's count to seven. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Did you connect it properly? I guess so. Come with me. Are you coming, Pawel? - I'm coming with you! - Stay put! Oh, shit! Let's forget it. They may be looking for us now. Wetting your pants, wimp? Dawid?! Elka?! Red is the best. Want some? Where are they? Inside! Haven't come out yet! Dawid, it's a stupid prank! Elka?! Dawid?! And you don't know? You tell me all those details and you don't know? What makes you think I wore a red dress during the last explosion? - What color, then? - Blue. I wore red at the airport. I remember you tore it in front of the tunnel. But it was blue. What happened to Dawid's pistol? How about that? My God! Does it matter? Yes... If you want to know the truth, then, everything matters. Why do you call Kolota 'Headmaster'? He was just the senior teacher in our school. All right I change him to the senior teacher. Very good. The rest was just... the way you put it. What? What do you expect from me? I just tell you what I agree with and with what I don't. You must tell me the truth! You were with him till the end. What happened to Dawid? He vanished into thin air? Where's he now? Everything was... ...the way you put it. I can't stand it. Why pretend you don't remember a thing? You were there. Why are you silent? Don't shout.
