Narrator: American astronauts have not flown to space from u.S. Soil in nearly 10 years. That is about to change. The united states is a nation of explorers. It's something that fundamentally appeals to our psyche. Narrator: This is an experiment to see if an innovative private company such as spacex can fly nasa astronauts and reinvigorate space exploration. It's an honor to be not only representing nasa, but spacex as well in this next step of space exploration. ♪ Musk: The scary thing to be launching people, you know, and risk is never zero.

If you'd asked for in '69 that were said by 2020, we would have had no hotels on pluto. They wouldn't have thought that in 2020 that the united states hadn't been able to send people to orbit for nine years. And so basically, we cannot be complacent about technology development.

To make an important announcement about the future of space travel. - Hey. Good to see you. - You, too. You doing alright? Yeah. Excellent. He is joined by elon musk, the visionary and at times controversial founder and chief engineer of spacex. This announcement is the result of nasa's radical new partnership with the private sector called the commercial crew program. Thank you for coming to spacex today in hawthorne, california. The highest priority is launching american astronauts on american rockets from american soil. We are on the cusp of making that a reality. There's a lot of negativity, you know, especially these days, it would be great to have something positive that perhaps can unite the country or the world, and advancement in space is one of those things. That is the reason that spacex was created. The launch of a crew is something that we've been working towards for 17 years. Narrator: Journalist christian davenport covers defense and space for the "washington post," has been on the frontlines reporting on the commercial crew program since its inception in 2010. This is sort of, in some ways, an experiment to see if nasa can rely on these commercial partners to fly their astronauts safely. Narrator: Nasa astronauts doug hurley and bob behnken will be the first to launch on spacex's inaugural crewed flight, marking the first time in history that nasa astronauts will fly on privately owned spacecraft. This first flight with crew is a test flight. Even the flight itself is a test flight, and it is done with test pilots work for nasa, who will be evaluating the system itself. And elon and I in strong agreement that whatever it takes to make sure they are safe is what we are focused on like a laser. [ Applause ] Narrator: Before spacex can launch, crew to major milestones must be completed without crew. The first is the demonstration one mission or demo 1 in which spacex must autonomously fly their crew dragon capsule to the international space station and back. The second test is called the launch escape test, also known as the in-flight abort test. If the rocket fails, the dragon capsules emergency abort system is triggered, ejecting the capsule safely away from the rocket. Then there is the third and final test called the demonstration two mission or demo 2, which will launch nasa astronauts bob and doug to the space station. Bridenstine: When we think about the history of human spaceflight, it's always been government owned, government operated systems. So the commercial crew program is our way of commercializing human spaceflight. Narrator: Robert cabana is a former astronaut and the director of the kennedy space center in cape canaveral, florida. The idea is to not have to own the vehicles. We buy a service. We buy a taxi ride the space to do what we need. We have two separate vehicles. One spacex, one boeing. Bridenstine: When you have multiple providers that are competing against each other, they don't keep coming back to the taxpayer asking for more money. We'd like to have access to space be so low cost that industry is sending workers to space in a way that's going to be transformative for humankind. Narrator: When a commercial crew program was first proposed, there were doubts about whether it could work. Many worry that privatization would lead to decreased oversight, accountability and less revenue for the government. You know, we really are in another golden age, if you will. It's neat to see and it's neat to be, you know, maybe what you would argue as it is the ground floor of that now with commercial crew and what we're doing for spacex. Here with a commercial crew program, you've got two new capsules. The boeing starliner and the space x crew dragon. New technology, new innovation going into them. They're autonomous. They have the ability to fly to the international space station, meet up at the space station in orbit and autonomously dock with it. It's like a self-driving car that can park itself. And that's a new technology that we haven't seen before. Narrator: In 2014, nasa's commercial crew program awarded spacex, a $2.6 billion dollar contract. After nearly a decade of designing and testing their new spacecraft, spacex will be the first private company to launch nasa astronauts. I'm pretty excited about being on the first flight of a new spacecraft, and it's awesome to work with the spacex team. You know, it's just a just a wonderful place to be. I couldn't I dreamed for a greater opportunity than this. ♪ Spacex is a hugely ambitious company founded by tech entrepreneur elon musk in 2002, ultimately with the goal of trying to colonize mars. We want the exciting things that we see in sci-fi, like sci-fi movies and books. We want that to come true one day. We're making stuff real. In fact, I think hardly anyone in the public knows if this is happening. I gather you get this message across, like really cool search happening. You know, tune in. Davenport: But for all of the triumphs and all the successes, all the attention that a company like spacex gets, they have not flown humans before. That's a huge responsibility. Nasa's astronauts for their pride and joy. They're national heroes, and their lives are being entrusted with these companies. So we're going to see if they can pass that test. ♪ Narrator: Today's launch marks the beginning of the crew dragon demo 1 mission. This is one of spacex's most challenging milestones yet, a five day unscrewed journey to the international space station and back. Davenport: Before nasa allows boeing and spacex to fly their astronauts, they require the companies to first do a test flight without crews onboard the spacecraft. That's to make sure that these companies can get the capsules to the space station and back safely. [ Camera shutters clicking ] Reed: The demonstration one mission or the demo 1 mission is an unproved flight. We're sending the dragon autonomously to space station to dock and come home. We're gonna be in firing room four for the launch itself, listening along with a team and kind of keying on the things that would be relatively important to us. Really is our chance to not be on board, but be with the rest of the team that will support us when we actually fly this vehicle when demo 2 comes around. ♪ Narrator: This is the first flight of spacex's new crew dragon capsule, which will one day carry astronauts. It sits atop the spacex falcon nine rocket. It's 16 feet tall, 13 feet in diameter and can carry up to seven people. This mission will test all the systems required to keep passengers alive in the vacuum of space. We spent years designing and testing of the vehicle systems. That day is really the day that the rubber meets the road. We fly the vehicle, we test the interfaces of the rocket of the spacecraft and make sure that it'll work the way we think it's going to work. I mean, the sheer number of tests that have occurred for dragon and falcon is staggering to think about. I mean, cumulatively, must be tens of thousands of tests of one kind or another. Narrator: Everything is riding on the success of this mission. And if it fails, it's back to the drawing board before spacex will be allowed to launch nasa astronauts to the international space station. One measure of success is how well nasa and spacex personnel work together across the country. The dragon capsule is monitored by spacex mission control in hawthorne, california. The international space station is supervised by nasa in houston, and the launch of the falcon rocket is conducted by spacex in firing room four at kennedy space center in florida. Nasa administrator jim bridenstine waits along with countless spectators in anticipation of this historic launch. What's fascinating is the level of public interest and uncrewed test flight. I've not seen those since the space shuttles. It's an amazing day. Narrator: For elon musk and the team at spacex, the stakes are incredibly high. Failure could be a huge setback. Not just for spacex and the commercial crew program, but for human space exploration. ♪ Man: Go for lunch.

Narrator: The falcon 9 rocket is composed of two parts, the first stage and the second stage. A rocket sheds wait as it climbs higher. Once the falcon 9 first stage uses up all of its fuel, it is no longer needed and separates, making the entire system lighter. Then after the second stage use up all of its fuel, it also separates, releasing the dragon capsule into orbit. ♪ Man: Stage separation confirmed. Matthews: The falcon 9 first stage is separating from the falcon 9 second stage. Once the first stage of falcon 9 has separated from the second stage, it's done its job. Its primary mission is to get the second stage on its way with dragon to the space station. We do have a secondary objective for the first stage of the falcon rocket, which is to come back from orbit and land. Narrator: The norm has always been to let the first stage fall back to earth and crash into the ocean. But spacex has invented the first and only reusable orbital class rocket, which can fly itself back to earth and land so it can be reused multiple times. Matthews: For the first stage, it starts its engines back up. It flips itself around, and the whole four stages reentering the earth's atmosphere and slowly making its way back down for a landing on a drone ship that is out in the atlantic ocean. ♪ Man: Landing lights deployed and falcon 9 has landed.

Matthews: The second stage is lighting up its engine and it's taking the dragon spacecraft into orbit. Once the second stage successfully gets dragon into the orbit that it is intended to go, its separate dragon and moves away. Narrator: This is a pivotal moment. The separation of the second stage from the dragon capsule is the final step of the launch sequence. Man: Dragon separation confirmed. [ Cheers and applause ] ♪ ♪ ♪ Narrator: The crew dragon is now on track to dock to the international space station. Bridenstine: It's amazing. This is a game changer. Now, let me be clear. This is the beginning. This is the first quarter of a long football game that's five days long. I'm not going to be overexcited at this point. Five more days. Even though dragon is able to autonomously only fly, there actually was somebody inside the capsule. And it's basically what you call an anthropomorphic test device. The passenger for this uncrewed launch is named ripley. She is equipped and wired with sensors that are going to tell us about her experience. So during launch, she's going to experience different g forces. And we want to make sure those are safe for future crewed missions. And we've done a lot to predict what that's going to be like, and we want to be 100 percent sure that our predictions are consistent with the flight that she is going on. What really matters is the direction that those gs are going through your body. We try to put all the gs through the chest because they can tolerate a lot more. So if you're dropping sort of like bungee jumping, it could be going up and down your head. That's not as good as if it's going straight through your chest and you're accelerating in a car. ♪ Rendezvous is the complex ballet where a spacecraft goes from, where the launch vehicle leaves it in space to docking to the international space station. Narrator: Robert dempsey is one of nasa's flight directors for the international space station. He works with teams responsible for this phase of the mission called rendezvous and docking. Dempsey: The launch vehicle places it in orbit. That's low earth orbit. It's actually fairly below and behind the international space station. And it'll perform a number of burns or maneuvers where it will catch up to the space station. And you can think of rendezvous is kind of like a case where a police officer, for example, was sitting by the side of the road and a speeding car comes zooming by. And what he will do is the police officer will then go from zero and immediately start to accelerate towards that car. It's got to match that speed. And eventually when it catches up to it, it's got to slow down. If it goes too fast, it's going to go past the speeder. If it doesn't go fast enough, it'll eventually not be able to catch that speeder. So it's the same sort of process. This is a fairly critical operation because this is the first time this vehicle has ever flown. And we want to make sure it does not collide with the space station. Narrator: A little over 24 hours after launch, spacex's crew dragon capsule autonomously flies itself to the international space station. Now begins the critical docking procedure. It requires meticulous communication between spacex mission control in hawthorne, california, nasa mission control at johnson space center in houston, texas, as well as the one american astronaut and two russian cosmonauts onboard the international space station. This is the first time that a commercial vehicle will dock to the space station. It's also the first use of the international docking adapter, which is the port on space station where commercial vehicles are going to come up and dock. And so we'll see both sides get used for the first time. Woman: The station is ready for the crew. Petrzelka: The crew dragon spacecraft uses an automated system that is able to sense the position of the space station relative to the capsule and is able to guide the capsule into dock with station. Ultimately, the vehicles are fundamentally flying itself. But we also have ground control, who's monitoring it and setting up a certain amount of commands. There's also a certain amount of access that people in the space station. They can see what's happening on dragon and are in contact with the ground control at the same time. Woman: Monitor approach. Orientation as expected. Vehicle is in the corridor, performing [indistinct] At this point in time, we actually take a little pause. We stop within about 20 meters of the docking port. That's on the international space station. - Hold, command center. - Copy hold. Dragon hold confirmed. Matthews: And then the engineers at both nasa and spacex reviewed the data from the spacecraft they took. They make sure that everything is going according to plan and they're both happy. Woman #1: Please command that docking lights are on. Woman #2: Copy, command. Docking lights are on. Then dragon is allowed at that point to autonomously move forward with the approach and docking to the space station. - Dragon is resuming approach. - Copy. Petrzelka: The crew dragon spacecraft uses it 16 draco thrusters to maneuver into contact with the space station docking adapter. Woman: Frank is decreasing, vehicle is centered. The capsule inches in towards the station. Woman: Vehicles in the corridor. - Orientation as expected. - Copy. Dempsey: The mood inside mission control for a first time docking of a new vehicle is always a bit stressful. Now we've spent years planning and training and preparing for it, but space has always had a way of showing us things can surprise us. Crew dragon has a variety of safeties in place, so that should anything go off nominal, the capsule will automatically retreat and keep the station safe. Woman #1: All video and overlays look nominal all status fields are showing expected status. Woman #2: And we copy. Musk: You got to dock with the space station. And if something goes wrong, you're just in the void of space and you're in a vacuum with nothing. We got the space suits, we've got a lot of backup systems, but it's still a dicey situation. Woman: Dragon is go for docking. Narrator: This is the first ever attempt by the crew dragon to track the iss and move in for what must be a perfect, airtight lock. Narrator: After a successful launch into space and separation from the falcon 9 rocket, teams at spacex headquarters and nasa mission control closely monitor the crew dragon capsule as it faces its toughest test yet, a critical first time docking with the international space station. If everything goes perfectly as expected, we'll just be monitoring, making sure everything goes right. Woman: Dragon is presuming approach and is go for docking.

It's time for it to undock and return to earth. At that point, the international space station crew, they reverse the steps that they went through when dragon arrived.

It takes about six hours for dragon once it leaves the space station to come home and splashdown in the atlantic ocean. Dempsey: The mission is not over until the astronauts lands safely on the earth. It's not until then that we can breathe a sigh of relief and call the mission a success. We came out to see the splashdown as well and understand what the recovery team was going to go through, and so that was pretty exciting. Matthews: The recovery team is already waiting and ready to go get dragon out of the water. Petrzelka: The 16 draco thrusters are responsible for orienting the vehicle in the correct direction. They fire to slow the vehicle down to the point that it will come out of orbit and begin to reenter the atmosphere. Narrator: Reentry is one of the most dangerous points in the mission.

Musk: The reason I started spacex back in 2002 is really just to help us get to mars. You know, I thought there was like maybe a 10 percent chance of success that spacex would work at all. One path is we stay on earth forever, and then there will be some eventual extinction event. The alternative is to become a space faring civilization and a multi planet species, which I hope you would agree that is the right way to go. Yes? [ Cheers and applause ] Well, I'll tell you, there's a lot that makes elon musk unique. It's passion for what he believes in. He's committed to what he's trying to achieve. He's willing to put his money where his mouth is, and then achieve really stunning things. Elon musk was born in south africa and emigrated to canada and then to the united states. He was one of the co-founders of paypal, and that's how he made his millions. And after he made his money, start thinking about what he wanted to do next, and what he could do to help humanity and space travel was one of the ideas he had. There's so many things that make people's sad or depressed about the future, but I think becoming a space faring civilization is one of those things that makes you excited about the future. You know, his vision at the time was just we need to get the american public inspired to increase nasa's budget. That was his goal. And I'm like, "hey, you and I have the same goal on that one." this is under construction, but this is where our mission control and launch control will be. There's gwynne at her cube. Shotwell: I joined spacex in September of 2002, and it was me and 10 other people. Narrator: Spacex president and chief operating officer gwynne shotwell is a key member of the team. Elon was very clear with everybody. We were to build the technology that was necessary to take people to live on other planets. This is the israeli test article of our dragon spacecraft. This area is used for the engine components. Davenport: There's a saying the easiest way to become a millionaire in space is to start out as a billionaire. Shotwell: He brought money, right? He brought the first $70 to $100 million to this company. And that was key because that allowed us some runway to demonstrate that this little group of folks could grow into a company and build the capabilities that no one thought we could. It created ultimately falcon 1 and did three failed launches stuck with it, went up to the edge. Narrator: Elon knew that he had to push the boundaries and create a superior rocket in order for spacex to thrive, but the company only had enough money to build and test four rockets. The first three falcon rocket launches ended in disaster. The future of spacex looked bleak. Hi, welcome to spacex. You're here in the lobby. I mean, the very early days, I'd meetings with nasa and they'd be like, yeah, whatever, internet guy, it's paypal, whatever, you know, it's this just some rich guy who's going to, like, lose all his money and rocket's not going to work, which is totally fair.

All three times were unsuccessful. And they had one more chance, the fourth flight of falcon 1. ♪ If it didn't work, then spacex would have gone bankrupt and we would not be around. ♪ Fortunately, a flight four did work. Narrator: The falcon 1 rocket was a success. In 2008, spacex landed their first nasa contract. Spacex was now officially in the space game. [ Cheers and applause ] Nasa awarded contracts to spacex and then orbital sciences to fly cargo and supplies to the international space station. Nasa brought capital to the company at a time when it was absolutely critical for us.

With nasa, we initially got until like the maverick section or like the highly unlikely to succeed but we'll take... We'll take a chance on them. But we're definitely not the considered the a-team. Let me put it that way. [ laughs ] Narrator: Under contracts with nasa, spacex has flown multiple cargo resupply missions to the international space station. But flying cargo was never the endgame for spacex. Their goal has always been to fly people. It was the company's success with these prior programs that gave nasa the confidence to hire spacex to fly their astronauts for the commercial crew program. We've had a long and very productive working relationship with nasa over time, gradually building up from these guys have no chance to know over the course of now 18 years to the point where nasa has enough confidence that they're going to launch astronauts on the spacex vehicle.

So they're both married to astronauts and they both were even in each other's weddings. Man: That's megan mcarthur, who is our flight engineer. Woman: Astronaut karen nyberg blasted off for her mission aboard the international space station. Having spouses that are astronauts that have been through what we're going through, that kind of recognize that there's long days that are involved, and they appreciate that aspect of it. They understand the ups and the downs. They understand the risks. It just makes it a lot easier in some respects and maybe harder for them in some respects, because they do understand all the risks and they've done it. Woman: You left a three year old son at home. He missed his first day, I think, at preschool. Of course it's hard, but we do have great communication. My husband sends up pictures and videos. We both have families that are pretty similar. We both have young boys that are in elementary school. They're both going to get a chance to really kind of see us flying space for the first time. I'm really excited to be able to share this with my son. He understands that rockets are dangerous, and he first said, "you can't fly on that rocket." and we had to get him over as kind of, you know, the emotion that goes along with riding on a rocket ship and get them comfortable with that. As we move towards flying these two individuals, as we often refer to them as these two fathers. Right? There these these two people who have families, it's something that we take very, very seriously. We want to make sure that everything we do is right and that we're going to bring them home safely. Any time you're developing new spacecraft, new technology, there's so much risk that's inherent in that. And when you put human beings on board, that makes the stakes so much higher. Everything, everything has to go right for it to be a success. And the nature of our business as military test pilots, school graduates kind of going through what we've been through. We recognize that there are all aspects of risk associated with our missions or the tests that lead up to it. It's a scary thing to be launching people, you know? And risk is never zero. Narrator: Spacex's success record is far from perfect. Man: Three, two, one. Lift off of the spacex falcon 9 rocket. Narrator: On June 28, 2015, spacex launched their seventh cargo resupply mission for nasa to the international space station. Man: We appear to have had a launch vehicle failure. Narrator: Several minutes into launch. The falcon 9 rocket failed and completely disintegrated, destroying the entire contents of nasa's cargo. It's definitely a setback, but the fact the matter is rockets are just extremely difficult. Narrator: It was later determined that the failure was likely caused by a single strut inside the rocket that broke free and breached a helium tank. Then on September 1, 2016, another major failure. ♪ The spacex falcon 9 rocket that was supposed to launch a communications satellite blew up during a test fire. You know, it's part of testing. These things do happen, and the thing you want to obviously avoid is when people around that vehicle, you don't want those things to happen. So that's why you test, and spacex really wants to test things to their full capability and sometimes things do blow up. Neither of these missions were intended to carry humans. This is why the next failure spacex encountered would be their most difficult. We experienced an anomaly on the test stand where our crew dragon vehicle from non-crewed test flight exploded. Narrator: During a test, fire of the engines, the very same dragon capsule that was used in the demo-1 one mission was completely destroyed. Davenport: I mean, they lost the entire dragon capsule, which was a huge setback for them. And it raised some real concerns. When the dragon capsule was lost, we go through that range of emotions.

So after going to florida, seeing a new ship kind of launch into space, he was he was ready for me to go. I think going along with that, not only, you know, kind of reinforcing some things to your family, but reinforcing things with the team. We kind of felt like in some ways we had to kind of get the team back up, especially the team in florida, because obviously they took it very, very hard and very seriously. They recognize that they're responsible for our safety, kind of going forward. So it's pretty hard on that team to look us in the eye after having, you know, a failure like that. Right after the explosion, nasa and spacex led an investigation. They quickly found the root cause of the problem. Narrator: The spacex investigation revealed that the cause of the explosion was an unexpected reaction between a fluid under high pressure and a titanium component inside the vehicle. The only we had... we had the capsule strapped down to a stand and we had a large series of high speed cameras and tons of sensors which allowed us to really get to the root cause of a very nuanced risk that we would not have otherwise known about. From an engineering perspective, this was actually a success. We identified a new failure and we're actually making our vehicle safer. We're making the whole industry safer with this new understanding. I'm very proud of the spacex team. And in fact, it just came from a dragon engineering review. We went through a detailed list of all the risks. And I think that the dragon visionary team has done a great job in working closely with nasa, and also we're just going through and double checking everything to make sure that things are as reliable and as safe as possible. How does a test pilot kind of prepare for a first flight in a spaceship? That's a great question, because the last time we did this in an orbital vehicle, it was john young and bob crippen. So it's been a while. Behnken: We usually ask, "what if it doesn't go" exactly the way you planned, then how should we be prepared? And so we really try to dig into every piece of the puzzle to really understand what's our plan and then what's our backup plan. And we're prepared for all of those things. Narrator: Nasa and spacex must prepare for all potential problems. If there's a fire on the pad, the astronauts must escape quickly so they train an emergency escape systems. Spacex has on launch pad 39 a an emergency egress apparatus. If there is a fuel leak or the astronauts need to get off that launch tower as quickly as possible. So they've set up essentially a giant zip line narrator: From 265 feet above the ground, the slide wire basket whisks the astronauts down the line in under 30 seconds to a distance of approximately 1,200 feet from the pad. ♪ ♪ Davenport: There are armored vehicles waiting for them that they can get into and then be escorted away to safety. Narrator: The launch pad isn't the only place where astronauts face potential danger if there are rough seas or storms, the capsule splashed down in the ocean would present a challenging rescue. The water egress test is where we practice getting crew members out of the capsule when it's floating in the water in an emergency situation. Landing in the water, anybody who's been on a deep sea fishing trip knows that you can get pretty seasick pretty quickly, having not even been to space. So landing in the water is somewhat of a challenge, but the physiological aspect. So we'll see how we react. When the astronauts come back from space, they'll land in water. We will pull them onto our recovery ship and the first thing we do is I'll enter the capsule and I will make sure that they're healthy, decide how they need to be brought out of there. We want to make sure that we move them really slowly to keep them from being sick. And we'll do a lot of things to keep them comfortable when they return. This is what we do as astronauts. This is what we do as test pilots, you know, and and the opportunity to be able to go fly this vehicle for the first time with crew is just something you could never pass up. When we go to test pilot school, this is the kind of thing that you wouldn't even imagine you to get a chance to do. It's almost a once in a generational opportunity. ♪ ♪ - Hey, bob, - it's good to see you, doug. Narrator: In 2014, the commercial crew program awarded spacex $2.6 billion to create a new launch system. Today, nasa administrator jim bridenstine is visiting the spacex factory to see how the taxpayers money is being used. The spacex factory is like a candy land for aerospace. It's like this incredible place because you can see rockets being built, lots of rockets. You can see lots of engines being built, you can dragon spacecraft being built. You can really see the cutting edge future of spaceflight all the time all around you. Narrator: This is the part of the factory that houses the revolutionary falcon 9 rocket. This rocket essentially been designed with the help of nasa with the help of the air force. It's really designed for how do you make the most reliable rocket ever made? - Right. - That is our goal.. Falcon 9 is essentially standing on the shoulders of titans, as they like to say in literature. We've built upon a lot of those lessons, the things that nasa has learned, we've taken that, but use kind of a clean sheet of paper that says, "how can you build a rocket" knowing that we want to do things "that have not been done before?" in the history of spaceflight, rockets were used once. Man: Lift off of the atlas 5. Davenport: The first stages went up, delivered their payload to space. Man: We have stage separation. Then they splash down in the ocean, never to be used again. That would be like flying cross-country from new york to l.A. And throwing away the airplane. That would make commercial aviation enormously expensive. And yet that's what we've been doing in space. We have lift off of falcon 9. What spacex has done is developed a rocket that can be reused. It's first stage booster delivers its payload to orbit... Stage separation confirmed then it flies back and lands on land or at a ship at sea. We have an interesting history at spacex when we talk about failure. ♪ Narrator: Spacex knows that failure is an unavoidable stop on the path to success. Now that they're on the verge of flying astronauts for the first time, the stakes have never been higher. Also, the restaged felt bad because it's designed to be returned. That stage is insanely robust. Is really gone through its paces. The falcon 9 is a huge step forward in spaceflight and achieving the goals of spacex and ultimately making life not that planetary and lowering the cost of space. The biggest achievement is the ability to return the falcon home to land. And it is hard. It's definitely hard to do. You need to be able to accept failure during the design, the innovation process here at spacex. And a lot of times in the rocket business, failing means you're making craters. There's a smoking hole in the earth somewhere where a great idea came up a little bit short and crashed into the euro. During the test phase, we would get close to the ship. But we're maybe going sideways. We ran out of propellant. ♪ But we do that because you use a test, a fly, a test, a fly, and then figure out how it works, not necessarily by just running analysis in computers, but by actually flying the rocket. That's where you really learn what the rocket can do. For decades, honestly, people thought that that was not something that you could do. They thought it would just be too hard to bring a launch vehicle back to control that vehicle coming all the way back to earth narrator: After years of designing and testing the falcon 9, in 2015, spacex set out to make history by attempting the first ever landing of a first stage orbital rocket. Man: Stage separation confirmed. Insprucker: To bring falcon 9 back to earth. We've got a navigation system in the first stage. Most first stages don't have that. The rocket will then relight three of the nine engines to begin to slow down. Each engine can be moved left and right, up and down so that we can steer the rocket back towards where the landing sites are going to be. Man: Stage one landing burn has started. Reed: I've heard it described as you standing on the top of the empire state building and you drop a pencil off and you have to land the pencil on it's eraser on a postage stamp. Ultimately, it's not beyond the realm of physics. That it's not beyond the realm of physics, there's an engineering way to get it done. Man: The falcon has landed. [ Cheers and applause ] Wow. This thing actually landed intact. Amazing. That was crazy. [ Cheers and applause ] There's an old phrase, if you're not failing, you're not learning. So if you're too cautious and you never fail, you're not actually figuring out how to push the envelope to do the kind of things that no one has done before. ♪ Musk: You know, there were a lot of people that didn't think the rocket landings were real big thing, that we were just like running the video in reverse. Such I feel like it get confused between improbable and impossible. There's lot of things that are improbable, but unless you breaking laws of physics, it's not impossible. Insprucker: Currently, the falcon 9 is designed to be flown 10 times. Each time we do a refurbishment, what we call vehicle maintenance. That doesn't mean that it expires after 10 flights. Instead, as we get close, we will look to do some more testing because we expect the falcon 9 can fly way more than 10 flights. We just ease up on it a step at a time as we expand the history. ♪ This is launch complex 3a at cape canaveral on kennedy space center. This building houses and processes falcon 9s that have landed at our landing pads or have been landed on the drone ships and have come into port. To refurbish a rocket, they roll into the hangar. We load them into their pressing rings and it's a matter of weeks to process them and get ready for launch. Reusability is incredibly important to space exploration. One, it helps of cost savings. And two, it helps time. If every time you build a new vehicle, we would be waiting and waiting and waiting for new rocket to be produced. But we're able to fly rockets, land them and reuse them. That means we can access space on a weekly basis versus like a monthly or yearly basis. The end goal is obviously to have zero refurbishment, to be able to land and then relaunch like airplanes to ensure that we're able to access space on a daily basis. That's something that spacex is very proud of and what we're trying to do as a stepping stone to help us to get to mars. Currently, the stages investors crash in the ocean. You can't recover the hardware, so you can't see where there was a close vote. When we get the vehicle back, we examine the vehicle and physically see it. Was there anything that virtually had a burn through or we were close on margins. Right. And then we can adjust that in the design. Well, what we're seeing when you use the same rocket the second, third, fourth, fifth time, insurance rates actually go down, not up. That's how you tell. Insurance company is pretty sharp. - Right. - They don't like losing money. After you get through that first flight, just like a commercial airplane. You like an airplane that, you know has been flown several times rather than being the first customer on board the airplane. The commercial insurance rate is the best indicator - of the reliability of a rocket. - Right. And we have the best insurance rates in the world. - Oh, is that right? - Yeah. I didn't know that. The holy grail is really a fully reusable orbital system. That's by far the most important thing. It's like the difference between having aircraft that are reusable or not or cars. The profundity of this is not well understood by very many people. Narrator: Team spacex still has one more critical test to pass before they will be allowed to fly. Nasa astronauts. What happens if a rocket explodes in flight? [bleep] There is a plan to save the crew. Spacex now must prove that it works. ♪ Narrator: The crew dragon capsule is a spacecraft that houses the crew. It is replacing the cargo dragon capsule that was previously used on spacex resupply missions to the international space station. The dragon spacecraft that will be using to carry astronauts to the space station, bring them home is really a 21st century spaceship. My first impression of the inside of crew dragon. I was amazed. It's obviously a modern space vehicle. It's very sleek design inside, very comfortable. The seats are actually car racing seats, so the safety factors go up considerably. Musk: We've flown crew dragon already to the space station and back. We subsequently made a lot of changes, improvements. But we also just have to be absolutely paranoid about safety. ♪ Hurley: Well, the experience of training in an accurate capsule with a spacesuit is invaluable. Bob and doug were there spacesuits in this simulation because we want training to be as flight like as possible for them. Spacex dragon, we are ready to test drive. ♪ Hurley: When you have all your equipment on, it allows you to get more comfortable in a situation. So the more you can train in those suits, the better you'll be on the real day. It's exciting to see, you know, modern components in a spacecraft. You get very used to the shuttle. The 2,000 switches, circuit breakers. The seats, it's not the most comfortable vehicle to fly in. Behnken: You know, for those of us who've been living with switches from the '60s for all these years, to see a modern interface is something that's pretty exciting. Spacex dragon, we got [indistinct] Woman: Copy that. Some of the great innovations that we've made. We have wonderful touch screens, so you can see everything that's going on in the vehicle. You can get all the data that you need about the vehicle. You also control the vehicle all from these touch frames. The gloves are compatible with the touch screen. It's imperative because there are operations you need to do with the gloves on. [indistinct] are updated. Hurley: The dragon capsule is almost completely automated, so it should be able to fly the entire flight without us intervening at all if everything goes normally. And I think it's the way of the future with vehicles. I mean, we see that now with cars. We see it with airplanes. And this is just the next logical step. Woman: You should monitoring your dragon longitude and knowledge about initiation of claw separation prep. When you think about automation, it's a layer of complexity and software that needs to be verified. So the task for crew on a good day is hopefully that they don't need to do much. On a bad day, they need to understand exactly when and how they need to respond to the vehicle, the vehicle's behavior and what it's doing in space. Dragon, spacex, contact. Spacex, dragon. We got you loud and clear. Every single phase of the mission will be simulated, so we have launch sims, we have approach to station entry, descent and landing. And every single phase has failures that are unique to that phase and require different responses. Dragon, we are going in step into the scenario. Ultimately, even though it's able to autonomously fly, we want to make sure that the crew understands what's happening and that they can take control at any point in time to ensure their own safety as well. We can manually intervene if we think things are not going the way they should be with the automation. Dragon, spacex. Where's our flight computer? Yeah, it looks like we lost it. Narrator: Today, the astronauts are training for a scenario in which the flight computers fail. Since the dragon crew capsule is totally automated, it relies on the computers for almost everything. With the computers down, this could be a dangerous situation for the astronauts. We've seen one of our flight computer processes are not controlling the vehicle. So what we'll do in training is we break dragon. Dragon, basics. Please proceed to reboot flight computer. So if the flight computer goes down, we teach them how to reboot it. Okay, we've initiated the flight computer reboot. And we see the same on the ground. We're following. Thanks. During simulations, you'll see a lot of anomalies, malfunctions. Sarah and some of our other simulation supervisors, they relish those opportunities. Gillis: [indistinct] has been interrupted. We are investigating root cause on the ground. Thanks. Copy. It's really good not only for bob and I as the crew, but it's also for the team on the ground. It really throws the team different curveballs. Flight computer has transitioned to... Spacex, all our displays are back up. Well, that's great news. - Flash count. - Victory. ♪♪ Narrator: Nasa has required that spacex's design of the crew dragon capsule has a significantly higher level of safety than its predecessor, the space shuttle. Every aspect of dragon has been tested at the sub-system level, as an entire vehicle. There's so many test, it will blow your mind. Narrator: Even with all the safety features that spacex has built into their systems, nasa is also requiring the inclusion of a revolutionary new safety feature called the launch escape system. Menon: If there was a emergency on the pad, the capsule is able to separate from the falcon rocket. And that's done to protect the crew. I want to escape system is essentially an ejection seat for the entire spacecraft. If the computer sense a problem with the rocket, the spacecraft will automatically separate itself and fly through the air with its super draco engines so they can safely splash down in the ocean with its parachutes and save the crew from flight anomaly. The dragon spacecraft has two types of engines on board. The first started 16 draco thrusters. Those are small engines that make about 100 pounds of thrust. And those engines are what we're gonna use to maneuver and dock to the international space station. And then there are the eight superdraco engines for a launch escape scenario in an emergency situation, which make thousands of pounds of thrust. ♪ Crew dragon is utilizing 3d printing to manufacture some of the components on it. A 3d printer works by laying down layers of metal powder, and as it lays down each layer, it will melt together a specific part and then it builds up layer by layer to create whatever shapes that you want. And so this is really useful when we look at things like printing an engine that needs many fluid passages and it needs to be a very interesting organic shape. And because we've melted together layer by layer, you can make hollow parts, you can make very interesting shapes that would be difficult to make by any other method. ♪ Narrator: In 2015, space six performed a preliminary pad abort test of their launch escape system. Our pad abort test was performed to ensure that our spacecraft design could escape the launchpad safely to the water in the event of an emergency. Woman: Three, two, one, launch. ♪ During an escape, they will likely pull between four and six gs. That depends on the different variables and the situation. I think a roller coaster is under three gs. Man: We're over one kilometer. Trunk deployed. [ Indistinct talking ] Passing through six hundred meters. Narrator: The pad abort test was a precursor to a much larger challenge called the in-flight abort test. In-flight abort is a similar test, but it tests a different set of conditions. Instead of demonstrating separation from a rocket on the launch pad, the in-flight abort test will demonstrate separation from a rocket that is actively flying through the atmosphere. If there's a problem with the rocket, the in-flight abort test will show how the capsule can eject itself from the rocket and safely bring the crew down to the water. Narrator: The stakes for the in-flight abort test are massive. It is the last critical milestone that spacex must pass in order to be allowed to fly nasa astronauts. Woman: Liftoff. Man: Four, three, two, one, and lift off. Lift off of the 25th space shuttle mission, and it has cleared the tower. One of my strongest memories as a child was in fifth grade. We watched the space shuttle challenger blow up. A loss of the entire crew was a result of the fact that there was no launch abort system. It shuts down the program for a period of years. Well, we want to do now is we want to get to a day where when there is a catastrophic failure, we have a launch abort system that keeps our crew safe. ♪ Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're here today to talk more about the spacex in-flight abort test it's a demonstration mission for spacex to show that we're able to eject our capsule off of falcon 9 safely and reliably. This test is very important to us. It's really the culmination of years, close partnership with nasa. Band it's one of the key steps before we go to our demonstration to mission, which will carry bob and doug up to the space station. Narrator: Spacex must pass this critical in-flight abort test before nasa will allow them to fly their astronauts. Soon, human lives will be at stake. So every precaution must be taken. The plan will be that dragon is on top of the rocket. The rocket will take off. At about 84 seconds into launch, we'll trigger the launch escape system and dragon will carry the capsule safely away from the falcon. Dragon will hit about mach 2.3 as it's getting away. It will then hit an apache of about 40 kilometers high. It will jettison the trunk. It will reorient itself with the draco engines and then it will continue its trajectory down in about five minutes after launch. The parachutes will deploy, and about 10 minutes after launch, we expect splash down. The dragon recovery forces will also be out there. One of things I want to mention, and this is kind of exciting. The falcon has flown three times before and it's going to reflight for this test for the commercial crew program. The booster behind us or the falcon 9 behind us we'll be flying our in-flight abort. So this will be its fourth flight. To my knowledge, the in-flight abort test is the first ever full scale launch escape system, safety test. In the past, other crewed programs, they've done subscale testing. This the first time, I think, someone has ever taken a rocket and intentionally thrown it away with the sole focus on ensuring that the system they're designing to ensure the crew is safe will actually function as expected. Narrator: A big part of the cost of the in-flight abort test will be a multi-million dollar rocket that will be deliberately and completely destroyed in the test. Hi, chris davenport from the "washington post." question about the fate of your booster. You said it could tumble, it might come apart. You mentioned to fire. I mean, is there a possibility that it could actually explode if people are watching from the beach? Should they be prepared for that? Sure. Absolutely, chris. Yes, both stages are loaded with fuel. We expect there to be some sort of ignition and probably a fireball of some kind. You know, whether I would call it an explosion that you would see from the ground, I don't know. We'll have to see what actually happens. But I wouldn't... I wouldn't be surprised and that wouldn't be a bad outcome if that's what we saw. While you hope the abort engines never light, you don't want that ever to happen because that means something very, very bad has happened here I'm in an emergency situation, but it can happen. I mean, just recently, nasa astronaut nick hague was on a russian soyuz where there was a problem with the rocket, the soyuz spacecraft. Emergency abort systems lit and it ferried them to safety. Now, it was a wild ride and they pulled something like seven gs or seven times the force of gravity on their body. It was not a comfortable experience, but they were alive and they landed safely. And that abort system saved their lives. The in-flight aboard tests for doug and bob, that's immensely important because it just reassures them that the spacecraft that are going to get on is safe. Narrator: Key nasa and spacex officials have gathered in firing room four, also known as launch control at the kennedy space center. They will oversee today's critical in-flight abort test. If this test fails, the crew dragon program will suffer a major design setback. ♪ Musk: We're doing everything we can to make this mission as reliable as possible. No stone is left unturned. We're turning every stone over three times or four times just to get that probability of success as close to 100 percent as possible. This test is about the entire team, the nasa team and the spacex team coming together and pulling off a pretty complex exercise. We're going to launch a capsule, we're going to put it in the ocean, department of defense is going to have coordination required between nasa and spacex, and that entire team is going to show that they can bring a capsule home safely, bring the crew, if they were onboard, home safely. And so that's really what we're expecting to see out of this test. Woman: Weather is looking okay, and the range is green for launch. Man: Dragon is in countdown [indistinct] is armed. Go for launch. Woman: Ten, nine, eight... If the test isn't successful for some reason, of course, you know, you have a whole group of folks both on the spacex and nasa side that will have to take a look at things and figure out why it wasn't successful. And this is obviously something close to the last step. This is all part of building up to flying crew on dragon. Seven, six, five... Bridenstine: When you watch a launch abort test, you're wondering has everything been done to get this vehicle ready for an end-to-end test in one of the most stressful and dynamic scenarios you can imagine for space flight. Woman: Five, four, three, two, one. ♪ [bleep] Narrator: This is the final step. Everything is on the line with today's in-flight abort test. If this test fails, nasa will not risk the lives of their astronauts and the entire project will come to a halt. ♪ Woman: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero. Ignition, lift off. [indistinct] ♪ Narrator: This potentially life saving capsule ejection has been years in the making, and it will be over in just minutes. Rockets are... it's basically a controlled explosion that's pushing a mass into orbit at faster and faster speeds. And it's the most dangerous part of getting anything to orbit. And so to simulate a failure of the thing that is most likely to fail, the rocket, and demonstrate that the capsule with the precious cargo that's sitting in that capsule can survive that. That is so key. Narrator: Spacex has launched a falcon 9 rocket and crew dragon capsule. The abort is automatically activated when the system detects that the rocket is malfunctioning, such as in the case of an engine failure explosion or the rocket veering off course. The abort can also be manually triggered by ground control. That will happen in this test. Man: Vehicle is supersonic and passing to maximum dynamic pressure. Narrator: Once the computer senses that the rocket has malfunctioned, it blows the bolts, holding the capsule to the rocket. Man: Dragon launch escape initiated. Narrator: Then the crew dragon's superdraco engines fire for 10 seconds to propel the capsule away to safety. - Dragon's away. - Whoa. Musk: Because the super draco escape thrusters are integrated into the vehicle, you have a launch escape capability all the way to orbit, which has never been the case for any spacecraft before. ♪♪ [bleep] [ Indistinct conversations ] [bleep] ♪ Narrator: Approximately 10 seconds after the abort was triggered by ground control, the crew dragon capsule jettisoned away. The force of the ejection made the rocket unstable and it exploded. But the dragon capsule was already safely a mile away from the rocket. With the dragon jettisoned safely away, the trunk, which carries unpressurized cargo, is ejected and will crash into the ocean. Now the capsule will begin to reorient itself for splash down. However, the mission is not over. With the capsule hitting a top speed of mach 2, this last phase is key for the astronauts safety. Our parachutes are triggered and deployed when the capsule reaches the correct altitude. So at a high altitude, it will deploy the drone parachutes. And when it reaches a lower altitude, the main parachutes will deploy. [ Applause ] ♪ Woman: Fully open and we are coming up on about a minute until splash down. [ Indistinct conversations ] ♪ ♪ - Splash down. - Yeah! [ Cheers and applause ] To watch it go from start to end successfully, it just... it's really something to behold. And I know a lot of emotions on both teams today, and we're very excited about it. It's just one step on this longer road to creating a mass transit system for people to other planets. Is everything good? Everything's good. [ laughter ] Behnken: So as a crew member, it's going to ride onboard this vehicle. Having a system onboard dragon that can get you out is pretty cool. I think people sort of forget that technology does not automatically improve. It only improves if a lot of people work very hard on that technology. We have to drive innovation hard to make life multi planetary. I think this is very important to secure the future of life as we know it and to ensure that the light of consciousness does not go out. Bridenstine: We are a nation of explorers. We're also a nation of that leads. And this, of course, represents us returning american astronauts to space on american rockets from american soil. So this is a great opportunity for us to once again lead. And this time when we lead, we're doing it differently than we've ever done it before. Bridenstine: We need to make sure that we are constantly pushing the envelope, constantly moving forward with technology and making sure that we are commercializing it in the process. Today, we had a launch abort test of a commercial crew provider. Commercialization of space is the next giant leap. And when we take this leap, we absolutely need to make sure that our crew is safe. Narrator: The success of today's in-flight abort test sets the stage to send astronauts to space from u.S. Soil once again in a mission called demo-2. And for the first time, they'll fly aboard a private spacecraft. Bridenstine: So in this very challenging time when we launch to the international space station, something we haven't done from american soil since 2011, I do think that it gives people an opportunity to dream big and to look up and to know that we can do stunning things. And it gives people hope, not just in the united states of america, but throughout the entire world. I don't generally get nervous, but when I start thinking about this mission, I actually get quite nervous about it. The launch of demo-2 will be the day. This will be the moment for this company. This is the culmination of everything we have done since the company was founded in 2002. Musk: This is a crucial step. Getting people back to orbit again, you know, knock on wood. I think probably success is high, but it is not 100 percent. We're just doing everything we can to think of any possible way to improve probability of success, because this would be a big setback if if something were to go wrong. Narrator: Bob and doug are poised to leave quarantine and ride in teslas to iconic pad 39a at kennedy space center in cape canaveral, florida. Behnken: We're excited, of course, for the mission. And one of our goals is to share with everybody. Hurley: I hope that people appreciate the amount of effort done by so many people at nasa and so many people at spacex to get us to this point. When bob and doug walked down the crew access arm to the dragon capsule, they'll also be walking into the history books as the two astronauts that returned america to space from u.S. Soil. This will be a stunning achievement for nasa and spacex... Officially launching the second golden age of space travel. This is but the first step on a long journey that will take us back to the moon and to mars and beyond. ♪
