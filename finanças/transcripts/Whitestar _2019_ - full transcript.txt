It's their first time at the Holland Cup. Megan van Klaver and her horse Whitestar. NINE YEARS EARLIER Megan, what are you doing? -Of course, look what you did. -|'ll clean it in a minute. Of course, did you think I'd clean it? -Don't worry about it. -Leonard. -Yes. -The breeding mare hurt her leg. It happened in the meadow. The veterinarian said it was nothing. She's useless. You know how much it costs to breed with her? If she gels hurts, I'm broke and you're fired. -|I won't happen again, sir. -You're responsible, you get that? Yes, sir. -He's pretty mad. -Don't mind him. Sunny is his best mare and she bred with Salandino. Never heard of Salandino? The best jumping stallion ever. Of course, two gold medals at the Olympics. -Right. -I don't care about his medals. Alex acts like he's the father himself. Ladies, it's five o'clock. So go home, I'll finish this. Good luck, bye. I'd love to have my own horse. -What's stopping you? -How about money? That's just a detail. Darn, I forgot my bag. You go ahead, see you tomorrow. Calm down, girl. You're sweating. ls your leg hurting? I'll be right back. Hurry, somethings wrong with Sunny. I was afraid of that. -This won't be easy. -What's wrong? She's in labour, usually it happens at night. Have Alex call the veterinarian. Mr Kosac? Calm down, Sunny. Help is on the way. -Ten minutes? I'll tell him. -Why are you touching my stuff? I was looking for you, Sunny is in labour. -Impossible, I just saw her. â€”I'm serious, the vet is coming. The vet is... Did you call her? Who do you think you are? Get out, let me. ls the foal the wrong way round? I can't feel it, but I think the legs are wrong. He's the wrong way round. Where's that stupid vet? And what are you looking at? Go away. This is Megan's voicemail, leave a message after the beep. Sweetie, this is mum. I'm waiting for you in the shop, I'm locking up. Call me, bye. Hurry, the foal is the wrong way round. -Finally, what took you so long? -Stop pulling, you're doing it wrong. -It's my horse. -You're killing the foal. -Is that what you want? -Go ahead. But I'm warning you, if it goes wrong, I'm holding you responsible. Listen carefully, Alex Kosac. Threats are not helping now. Go get clean towels. Geez, here you go. What? This is Megan's voicemail, I'm not here... So? It wasn't easy, but you've got a beautiful foal. -Does he have a name already? -Salto Potente. "Salto Potenle". Forceful Jump. -Well, congratulations. -Thank you. That's disgusting, really? Disgusting. Come. Hello. -Why didn't you call? I'm worried sick. -I'm sorry, Mum. Things didn't go as planned because of this cutie. Right, start cleaning and leave her. Sunny's fine now. Hello, hi. You're here for your amazing daughter, she was a great help. Yes, I heard. We have to go. Bye, sweetie. You're already so strong. -Thanks for letting me help. -You have a feel for it. -Just like my dad. -Megan. Bye. Why are you still here? I'm not paying you extra. -Bye. -Thank you. -I'm so hungry, what's for dinner? -There's lasagne in the... -Two pizza Margherita. -Right. Hold on. Megan, do you have change? -Hey, Eddy. -Hey, Megan. -I didn't know you deliver pizzas. -I sometimes help out my dad. Fun. How much are they? These are on the house, because you're my classmate. -No, we can't accept that. -That's so sweet. Thank you, Eddy. Bye. -Right, thank you, Eddy. -No problem. Bye. So, a secret admirer. Look who's talking. What about you and Mr Kosac? He's been a jerk the whole holiday, but when he sees you he's a sweetheart. -What's that about? -He was with the same stable as Dad. -Really? -Hold on. Let me see. Here we are. That's so weird. Is that Mr Kosac? -You used to be so beautiful. -Used to? Not anymore. No, I'm just kidding. We used to do everything together, with the horses. And they were both in love with me. That's gross. It's the scariest thing I ever heard. But he stopped being nice when I chose your dad. -I'm so glad you chose Dad. -Yeah. Me too, sweetie. It's time for bed. Do you think Dad knows I want to be just as good as him? Yeah, he knew even before you were born. Dad is really proud of you. I'm sure of it. -Sleep tight, sweetie. -You too. See you tomorrow, honey. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow, Dad. -Good morning, Mum. -You seem excited. Another day to see Salto. Have a nice day. Seriously? GERRIT STABLES Hello? What do you want? I was... I... I have a flat tire and I was looking for a bicycle pump. -That's not a pump. -No, you're right. I'm sorry. Put it back when you're done. Sure, thank you. These are our sport mares. The details are listed here. -This lady can bite. -Bite? It's not that bad, give her something to eat. Hey, Eddy. What are you doing here? Eddy is coming to help out, so I'm training him. -Really? That's so cool, Ed. -Yeah... You'll be fine, right? Here you go. Give her the food, or she gets mad. -Now she's getting mad. -Let me. If I work here three more years, I can buy my own horse. Maybe you can just marry a rich guy. I'm gonna put the wheelbarrow away. -Juul.. -I think this holiday will be great. Stupid flies. Yeah, I think I can give you 50.000 euros for Salto Potente. Without training, I will just take it off your hands. -Fifty thousand? -I know it's a lot of money, -but I think he's worth it. -A lot of money? I won't sell him for less than 250.000. I don't think that's realistic. And you'll have to wail a few years. It's the best jumping horse right now. When he's trained he'll break all records. -So it's no deal if you don't have that. -Half a million? -You just said a quarter. -That's how fast it can go. Bye. -What? -Gel out. Cheeky bastard. THREE YEARS LATER Salto, come, yeah. Here. Hello, congratulations. Here you go, this is for you. -You didn't have to. -Just open it. For when you have your own horse. That's so sweet of you. You should save that for Eddy. That makes me happy. Great to see you again. And great timing, we're breaking in Salto. Broke'? Today? -Here, for your birthday, Megan. -Later, Eddy. -What's "breaking in"? -The first time someone rides the horse. What? My flowers. Good morning, Mr Kosac. I have a request. Yeah, so'? I heard that they're breaking in Salto today. And I wondered if I could do that. YOU? -That's for the experienced riders. -But I am a rider. Let me guess, you want to be like your dad? -Yes. -Just forget it, please. Your dad just was extremely lucky. The equestrian sport was not a big deal in his time. He'd never reach the top right now. Just go back to work, I don't pay you to do nothing. Just stand still. Good boy, nice. Calm down. You have to be careful with him. Let him get used to weight on his back first. -You have to do it with love. -Megan, gel out of the paddock, now. -But... -Ron, here you go. He's very strong-willed, we have to break that. -You should reward him, not punish. -I'm done with you. -You're such a terrible man. -Really, that's all? Go clean the stables. -Are you going home? -I'm done. -See you tomorrow. -No, forever. Mr Kosac can suck it. Seriously? Oh my God, but really, seriously? -What do you want? -You really helped me last time. -And I've got a flat tire again. -Well, you've found it. Did you know my dad? -I don't think so. -My dad had the same trophy for dressage. It's from a flea market. I have to go inside, my potatoes are boiling. -Sorry for the wet clothes. -No problem. -|t's wet in here as well. -Did you call someone? It's a few leaks, I'll fix it tomorrow, when it's not raining anymore. -Are you sure? It looks serious. -Sweetie, don't worry. Just go and sit down. There. Because I have something fun for you. -That's sweet of you. -This is for you. I can't accept it, Mum. -You can't even repair the roof. -But I want it, it's for you. We need another pot. Well, it's pretty cosy, isn't it? Sweet Salto. Why is the world this unfair? Seriously? Are you still at home? Shouldn't you... -Are you okay? -Yeah, I'm fine. Shouldn't you be at work? -No, I quit. That Kosac is terrible. -He can come across very blunt. "Come across blunt?" He treats Salto terribly. -I should call animal control. -Should I talk to him? -Mum, are you okay? -Yes, I'm fine. -I just have to lie down. -|'ll make some tea. I know it's more expensive to repair a roof in the weekend. But... I've got enough money. When I heard, I quit immediately. That Alex is such a jerk. I'm gonna get my salary. Are you coming? My mum's not feeling well, I have lo go to the shop. -Can I help you? -That would be great. You're just too soft, Ron. Never mind. Let me do it. No. So you think you're the boss? Yes, come in. -Hello. -Good day. -Thank you for coming again. -So, talk to me. Well, I have great news. I'm prepared to sell Salto Potente. Well, that's very good news indeed. So let's go see him. -He's a wreck, what did you do to him? -During training you can get some bruises. -Bruises? -Yes. Don't forget this is the son of Salandino and my best mare. -Hundred thousand euros and he's yours. -Hundred thousand for this horse? He's ruined, I won't even give you 500 euros. Five... Are you crazy? The butcher will give me more. Well, then you should take him there. I never want to see you again, you're no longer welcome. Never again. -That's 12 euros. -I'll use my card. Juul, can you answer that? Klaver Flowers, this is Julia. No, Megan is busy. -Thank you. -You too, bye. Yes, I'll let her know. Bye. It was your secret admirer. If you wanted to come to the stables. It's about Salto and it's pretty important. -Yes, but... -Just go. -I'll take care of things here. -I'll be right back. Don't hurry back, sweetie. What have I done to deserve this? -Of course, you want your money. -We've got an idea. The stable boy has an idea? I can't wait. We noticed that Salto's training is not exactly going to plan. And we thought Megan could train him. Right, I used my best people and he can't be trained. -Anything else? -Give her a chance. -They have an amazing connection. -It's not my job to give people a chance. The sooner I get rid of him, the better. If you don't want him, can I have him? If it means you stop complaining, yes. Really? He still represents a certain value. -I keep your salary, you get him. -Fine. Just go. From now on, everything will be fine. No way. -Mum. -There's no room for a horse. Our garden is too small and I don't make enough to take care of him. I'll never get this chance again and they treat him badly at the stables. -So he needs a vet, which costs money. -I'll work every weekend. -I can deliver pizzas. -Take him back. I don't want to. I wish Dad was still alive, he would've allowed this. I'm gonna help Julia in the shop and when I come back this horse is gone. Understood? Hey Megan, is something wrong? I can't keep him. -What's going on? -I can't keep him. Seriously, so this was all for nothing? You won't get your money back, it cost me enough already. -Put him back, they'll get him tomorrow. -Gel him? -What do you mean? -What do you think? Go, you've caused enough trouble. Leonard, take him. Let's go. -Do I need to get the whip? -No, no. Salto, come on. Calm down, you have to go. Just go. Salto, come on. Good boy. Poor boy. Here. You're not very lucky, are you? What are you doing here? Are you alone? You weirdo. Did you come all this way? You can eat the grass, but don't poop too much. There. No, I don't need your help. I'll do it by myself. Impatient one. This is your new home. It's not much, but it's fine for tonight. What's wrong? Where did that horse go? -Did you let him escape? -of course not, the door was bolted. The butcher would've given me 800 euros. -I'll go find him. -Me too. Never mind, too much hassle. I'll lake it from your salary. Done and dusted. Mum, listen. There's a horse in the shed. Dear Mum, do you remember you said I should always follow my dreams? So I did. Hey Megan, I've got terrible news. Something bad happened to Salto. He escaped. And Alex doesn't want us to look for him. -Alex doesn't want to find him? -He doesn't care anymore. That's amazing news. My mother is coming. Hi, Mum. -Bye. -I'll be right in. Eddy, wait a minute. I never thanked you. -For what you did for Salto and me. -|... Thank you. I made chili con came for you, without meat. So, it's actually chili con nada. Lovely. And what have I done to deserve this? -I thought you would be mad. -You're just the best Mum ever. -Megan, are you feeling okay? -Yes. -Are you going steady with that boy? -Mum, no, I don't... -I have a question. -Yes? Lovely. Never mind, it's not important. How are you doing? Are you okay? It's a bit small here, isn't it? Just a little longer. When Mum leaves, you can go outside. We have to keep you a secret a little while longer. -Mum... -Is this what you wanted to tell me? He just showed up and Mr Kosac doesn't want him anymore. He escaped and I wanted to tell you, but I was afraid. You're a sweetie, aren't you? -What should I do with you? -I don't know. We suddenly have a horse in our shed. I may have a solution. No flat lire this time? Good mowing, Genâ€œ. Marianne. -You know each other? -That's a beautiful horse. That's why we're here. We need a stable for him. I thought so. -How are you? -You know each other? -Yes, your dad used lo train here. -Really? Yeah, we made it to the top with your dad. Can I train here as well? When your father died, I quit. I'm just a useless old man. But can I keep him here? Please? -Come on, we'll find him a stable. -Can he really stay? Do you need a contract or something? Come on. This is a nice spot for him. There's enough space. -But you take care of him each day. -Yes, and I want to ride him as well. -You haven't done that yet? -No. Well, let's go and do that. -He was treated badly, he doesn't want to. -Is that your decision? Just relax and try it. He'll let you know if he wants it. Calm down. Calm down, right. I'll just put something on your back. It'll all be line. I promise. Good boy. You see? -I think it's enough for today. -Why? He's still calm. Beautiful. Right, calmly start trotting. Yes, yes. And now start galloping. And slowly stop. Are you sure this is your first time with him? It's not from a flea market, is it? Your dad gave this to me. It was his first prize. I think you could be as good as him. Really? -Do you mean you want to teach me? -I think so. You're talented and he is as well. -What's the name of our white star? -Salto. -Whitestar. -Whitestar, nice. But talent is not enough. If you really want to achieve something, you have to work really hard. Calm down. Sit up straight, Megan. Turn around, keep the reigns tight. Nice. Bye. Yes, yes, yes. It's going great. They're so sweet together. Sweet? You call them sweet? I've never seen a duo that is so deeply connected. -She said she'd barely ridden before this. -That's not true. No, I can see that. She's been riding her whole life. In here. Will you support her if she goes for it? Yes, I think so. -What do you mean exactly? -Next month is her first com petition. Next month? -Is she ready for that? -Yes. She's been ready her whole life. -No tricks, it's dressage, not a circus. -I didn't do it, he did it himself. Sure. Okay, are you ready? -I'm so nervous. -Not necessary. -There's just a lot of people watching. -That doesn't help. I'm just teasing you. You don't have to win. -But it's a competition. -It's about you, not the prize. -Just do the best you can. -So you don't want me to win? Just go for it and enjoy it. And here's a newcomer. Megan van Klaver and Whitestar, in their first competition. -To Megan's success. -Success? I won third prize. Yes, but you did amazing, so you're still a winner. So this is for you. -I can't accept this. -Yes, you can. And that's not all. You're competing tor the Regional Cup. -I can't do that, I just started. -What's the Regional Cup? It's like Premier Soccer, but much more important. -Champions League. -Really? Gerrit, I'm really glad you have so much faith in Megan. But what about the costs? I don't make enough money to pay the registration fee and all the other costs. -I'll just sell some stuff. -No, I can't ask you to do that. I have an idea. You should get a sponsor. A sponsor? -Nice job, Eddy. -Isn't it? And it's so fun your dad likes horses. Actually, he thinks we're sponsoring a soccer team. Are you ready, Megan? We're practising to music today. So fun, and I brought something. -I'm sorry, Megan... -What? That's not music. Here. This is music. -I don't know. -Your dad had to get used to it as well. -Was this really his music? -Yes. -But if you want something else... -No, it's fine. I want to use it. Drop the needle, G. -What? -Turn on the music. Nice. And? It's starting to look good. Do you want to ride with me'? I can't. I have to be home soon. I don't want to interfere with your love life, but it might be a good idea to lake riding lessons. Now it's really simple. Just sit down. Don't be afraid, the horse can feel it. He's just so big. Yes, very nice. Keep going. Nice. You're doing really well. This way. Very nice. There. You should see her. She placed third and can compete in the Regional Cup. -You're a big fan, aren't you? -Well... I think she's really good. Are you going back to work or what? I'm not paying you to look at your phone. Look, it's Megan. She's so good, she can compete for the Regional Cup. That looks like Salto Potente. -Yes. -Is he a dressage horse now? Did he take your phone with him? THE REGIONAL CUP Look, Dad. The local pizzeria is sponsoring them. Good luck, what's your horse called? Wait, don't tell me. Margherita? My apologies, good luck. Margherita. The next combination, Megan van Klaver and Whitestar. They've not been training very long, so I'm very curious. Well, did you pay attention? Good luck with your pizzas. Sorry, in the ring. Ignore her and just go for it. Did you see the pizza commercial on their trailer? -That's not done. -It's just different. -Let's give her the benefit of the doubt. -Whatever you say. That pizza girl of yours is not doing so bad. Whatever, I'm gonna get some food. Watch out with the flash, it'll spook Whitestar. Yes, I'm sorry. My mistake. But I need to make pictures for my dad. Shouldn't he see the horse as well? -What's happening? -She won't qualify. Calm down. You're a good boy. It's not your fault. Thanks for the show, it was hilarious. Apologies for my daughter, she takes after her mother. I'd like to congratulate you with your beautiful horse. It's really amazing. The way you did the first half of the Freestyle was extraordinary. There was such a balance. Too bad you didn't get through, but good luck. Thank you. Sweetie, come here. I have no idea what went wrong, he was just so stressed. We have some idea. I would like to talk to you. That horse over there... Seriously, Mr Kosac? No wonder he was so stressed. We just have to let it go. We can try again next year. -Right, next year. -Megan, do you have a minute? I'm Linda Rozenboom, I organise the Holland Cup. -Hello. -The first part you did was amazing. Thank you, too bad I ruined the second part. It's wasn't that bad. This is for you. -What's this? -Open it. HOLLAND DRESSAGE CUP It's a wildcard for the Holland Cup. -Can you just give this to me? -I organise it, so I do believe so. So we are competing after all. -How can I thank you? -Not necessary, I should thank you. The first part was the best I've seen in a long time. Go for it. -Congratulations. -Thank you. That horse is mine. We'll talk later. I'm so proud of you. -Don't you dare. -Just calm down, Marianne. Who do you think you are? Get out of here, Whitestar isn't yours. I never sold Whitestar, so he's technically still mine. -What's this? -Leave us. No, she can hear it. I just told them I've been looking for that horse. I'm so happy you found him and now I want him back. -What? I could keep him. -But you brought him back. -You kept her salary. -Do you know what he's worth? She could never afford him, even if she'd work a hundred years. -When did you become so pathetic? -It's not that bad. And to prove it, I'll give you hall your salary. And because I'm not that bad, I'll give you five minutes to say goodbye. Suit yourself. -That old Alex is not here anymore, is he? -The old Alex? -He could be sweet. -So now you want the sweet Alex? That sweet Alex disappeared when you chose the wrong one. -The wrong one? -Yes. Bastard. Come on, we have to be very quiet. Good boy. -I thought so. Let him go. -Don't touch him. Salto Potente is mine, okay? Giving him another name doesn't change that. Here. This is yours. We have to do something. Hey Eddy, thanks for the heads up. Without you I never would've found him. "Heads up?" What did you do? Nothing. I just told him how proud I was of Megan. You're such a loser, Eddy. Let's go. SIX YEARS LATER -How many again? -Another 100. How big is that arena at the Holland Cup? It's great you're helping me. But we have to hurry if we want to make it. -Do we need those as well? -Yes. -Did you gel tickets for Cavalluna? -of course. Whitestar. Did you ever hear anything about him? No. I still get mad when I think about it. -You were so great together. -Let's change the subject. I'm sorry, you're right. Do you ever see him? No, no, no. Stop it, have mercy. Put the blue ones on the cart. -These ones can go over there. -Good morning. -Are you ready for the competition? -Definitely. You're so amazing. Let's hope the horses don't like hydrangeas. -It looks nice, right? -Yes, beautiful. -It's nice we can stay a while. -I made them put it in the contract. Welcome at the Holland Cup. We start with Eline van Doom and her horse Elvis. It's been a longtime since we were here. They're really good. You did it better. You did. I'll be right back. -Can you get me something to drink? -Yes. And now the new combination from Limburg. Angela van Stijn and Firenzo. Let's go, Firenzo. Whitestar? Well, this is a very special Freestyle. Angela thinks she's in the circus. Calm down. Get her out of here. You again? How dare you interrupt the Freestyle? Ladies and gentlemen, there seems to be a little scuffle. -We ask you to be patient. -You'll pay for the damages. -Slop those empty threats, Alex. -Empty threats? This is the only day I can show how valuable my horses are. -And she ruined it again. -Whitestar belongs to Megan. -You stole him from her. It's Firenzo and you're out of your mind. Just be a man and admit it. You couldn't train him and didn't want him and now you're using another name. -So what? -"So what?" -Linda, this is none of your business. -It most definitely is. If this is true, this horse is stolen. That means you are banned from the Cup forever. -You don't have the right. -Actually, I do. If that horse is hers, I want you to give him back. -It's not her horse. -Whitestar and Megan belong together. This is not a shouting match. There's one way to find out if they belong together. We have an empty spot tomorrow for the Freestyle. You're not serious. This is such nonsense. -If she can stay in the saddle, he's hers? -No, she has to do well. Fine, 80 percent. -If she gets 80 percent, she can have him. -That's absurd, no one gets 80 percent. -That's a lot. -That's not true. -But it's not impossible. -Exactly. Okay, I approve this, on one condition. -That Firenzo... -Whitestar. Whatever his name is. Until the Freestyle, he stays with her. Guys, it's tomorrow. Megan, you haven't ridden him for years. Megan, what do you want? -I don't know. -I'm sure you can do it. What do you think Whitestar wants? -I think we should do it. -Listen, it's impossible. But I've seen so many impossible things in this life. But we have to train really hard. -I don't even have a riding hat. -Do you want to borrow mine? Eddy? I'm sorry, I just wanted to help. How come you can suddenly ride? Well, its... Inner leg and outer reigns. Nice. Hands lower. Keep going, calm down. Keep the rhythm. Calm down. This was the amazing Freestyle by Richard van de Meer and Storm. A beautiful score, the choreography was much appreciated as well as the beautiful music. Music. Do you have your phone with you? And now we have something really special. Please give me your attention for the last combination this evening. This is their first Holland Cup. Megan van Klaver and her horse, White-star. But this is a different song. Her own music. She should do it her way, that's better. Ladies and gentlemen, what a great ending of the Holland Cup. They've got 81 percent, we seldomly see a score like that. Exactly, so I would like to say Pm Alex Kosac. Whitestar is from my stable and I personally... Here you go.
