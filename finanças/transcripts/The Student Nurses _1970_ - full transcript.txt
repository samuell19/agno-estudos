Before we can do anything to help you, you have to go to room 207 for a checkup. All the doctor will do is listen to your heart and take your blood pressure. You've had your blood pressure taken before, haven't you? Nobody's gonna hurt you. Oh! Oh, no! (Pris grunting) Oh, no. Oh! No. (Pris grunting) No. (grunting) Doctor. Doctor. There's a manic patient in room 25, and he's gotten violent. - Has he received any medication? - No, he just arrived. - All right, prepare 50 milligrams of chlorpromazine for intramuscular injection. - All right. - Patterson. (men groaning and grunting) He's trying to bite me. Bring it over here. Dammit, bring it over here, I've gotta act now. (patient groaning and whining) That'll work. Get his arm. (patient screaming) Just what is it about the way we handled that patient you don't like? - It was brutal. - There are many things in medicine that are brutal. You better learn to accept that right now. - Everyone has a bad reaction now and then, you'll get over it. - Thanks a lot. - Anytime, Phred, see you later. - Who was that? - He's a resident, obstetrics and gynecology. And I saw him first. - Don't worry, he looks a little square around the edges. - Remember, you're not nurses yet. In fact, you're just beginning to learn. Many of you still haven't prepared for your futures after graduation. Some haven't even applied for positions. - They're probably the ones that have found husbands already. (student laughing) - Well I'm sure that doesn't cover everybody. So, Lieutenant Schaffer of the Army nurse corp will be in my office tomorrow at three. And now before Dr. Warshaw begins today's lecture, I would like to give you your last assignments. Please, check the bulletin board to make sure of the exact date when you change over because they vary. Uh, Pamela Chandler, surgery. Susan Brown, orthopedics. Sharon Armitage, pediatrics, Priscilla Kovac, psychiatry, Lynn Verdugo, public health, Phred Stella, obstetrics and gynecology. - [Announcer] Dr. Barbara Cain. Dr. Barbara Cain, please report to emergency. - Dr. Caspar, I made a mistake. - Yes? - Mrs. Chang was suppose to receive 1/10th of a cc of adrenaline. - What did you give her? - One cc. - 10 times the proper dosage, when did you do this? - About an hour ago. - Look, I'll go check on her, you stay right here. (suspenseful piano music) Fortunately she has a strong heart. She's still bouncing off the walls, but she'll be all right. - Can they throw me out of school for something like this? - Come on. - [Announcer] Dr. Walter Wren, Dr. Walter Wren. - You did the right thing by telling me. Not everyone would've had the courage to do that. - But aren't you required to report me? - There's not many things I'm required to do. - Then it's all over. How can I thank you? - One way would be to work as hard as you can to be a good nurse. - I'm doing that, what's the other way? - We can be friends. - Then we should do something to cement our relationship. - How 'bout dinner? - Fine. - Why don't you meet me at my place. The Montrose Apartments on Montrose and Pierce. My name is on the mailbox. - How will I recognize you? - I'll be wearing my stethoscope. (door creaking open) (light jazz music) (door clicking shut) (footsteps clicking) - (giggling) Is that you, Dr. Caspar? Come on, it's an emergency. Hurry up, or I'll start without you. Dr. Caspar, shut the door behind you. - [Man With Hose] Hey, you left your door open. (seductive, jazzy music) - Hey, how 'bout a little privacy. (Phred gasping) Ooh! - You wanna play some basketball? Well how 'bout some tennis? They say that tennis does it better. - It's your problem, work it out for yourself. - It's not my problem if you can't remember what I look like. - So I forgot to turn the light on. - You also forgot to keep your clothes on. - Look, I didn't steal that key from you. - Okay, okay, but I told you I was gonna wear my stethoscope. - I know, and he was wearing a stethoscope. - Not my stethoscope, he wasn't. - They all look alike to me. - You could use a little education. (kids chattering) (gentle acoustic music) - Hi. - My new student nurse, I suppose. - Yes, I'm Sharon. - Would you get those books on the cabinet and bring them here? I know what's gonna bring about the end of the world, do you? - The earthquake that makes California slip into the ocean. - No. Would you take those and put them over there. - When we become so overpopulated that there isn't enough food. - That wouldn't be the end of the world. People would simply become cannibals. - That would be awful. - Would you take those and put them over there? - Didn't I just move those? - Yes. Now, pat your head and rub your belly. - You're not funny. - There isn't much to laugh at. You wanna know the answer to my riddle? - If you'd like to tell me. - The time approaches, he spies dark angels o'er him bend. When they close those heavy eyes, his privy world will end. - I don't understand poetry very well. - For each person, the end of the world comes when he dies. - Let's get your injection over with. - I don't want it. - It'll help you rest. - You think I'll live longer if I'm rested? - Dr. Warshaw thinks so. - You don't know what he thinks! He thinks it's a miracle I didn't die before I was 10. I know more about what I've got than he does. I've lived with it for 18 years. (tense music) - He's damn difficult to deal with, but he's right. - Well what do I do about his injection? - Give it to him when he feels like it. It's a cruel dilemma, Miss Armitage. We can prolong the life of a patient with cystic fibrosis, we can't cure him. - Well what if I took him outside during his less acute periods? At least it might help him emotionally. - If it makes you feel better. This is you first terminal patient, isn't it? - [Pris] I thought our main concern was the patient, not our stupid uniforms. - The patient reacts to what he sees, and what he sees is what you wear. - If I'm kind to a patient, he won't care what I'm wearing. Besides, it's all suppose to be about love anyway, isn't it? - Don't try to tell me what it's all about until you've had a little more experience. - Priscilla gets a little carried away sometimes, Miss Boswell. - So can I. You have a choice, Miss Kovac, either you lower your skirt, or I'll lower your grade. - Old Hawk Eye blows a cork over my skirt but doesn't notice I never wear a bra. - Never? - Never. (funky, up-tempo guitar music) Hi, what's in the perception salad? - Sunflower seeds, alfalfa sprouts, spinach leaves, lettuce, and carrots. Get it, it's best with herb dressing too. What are you reading? - Steppenwolf. - That's about some German prude who becomes a barfly, isn't it? - Actually, it's about a man's expanding awareness. How he lives a dull life until he meets some people who kinda take him on a drug trip. - Drug trips. Buy your ticket to the station, then swallow it. - Or smoke it. - What kind of a trip is that? - [Pris] Hashish. - What do you know about hashish? - It's a product of the Cannabis sativa plant, commonly named marijuana, also grass, pot, boo, weed, and in India, bang. - Far out, a pharmacist. - Not quite. - You don't know how to use chopsticks, do you? - No. - Wanna learn? - Sure. - Where you headin'? - Home. - Uh-uh, no you're not. (70s pop music) (light acoustic guitar music) - Hey, what's your thing, Les? - What's my thing? I got lots of things, my bike is a thing, my shoes are two things. My shirt's a thing too. - You know what I mean. - You mean what's my money gig? - [Pris] Yeah. - What's yours? - I'm a nurse, at least I will be. That's why I sounded like a pharmacist. So what's yours? - I'm a pharmacist, the not so legal variety. - Wow, what a groovy place. (gentle acoustic guitar music) (light, jazzy music) - Anybody home, hello? - Peace and quiet. - Boy am I tired. - Ah, you're tired, I'm pooped. - Well it's the pace, classes, work, classes, work. - Well, at least in your classes you get to sit down. I've got patients spread all over the damned hospital. - Oh, poor Dr. Caspar, mm-mm. I'm so pooped I could go to sleep, almost. - I'm so pooped I am asleep. Well, maybe half asleep. (giggling) (both giggling) - There. Ah! (Jim moaning) - Hi. This is Les. - Hiya Les, peace. Those hippies aren't much on manners, are they? - [Pris] What would you like? - [Les] What do ya got? - [Pris] All kinds of good things. - [Les] You know the body's a temple, so I'm pretty fussy. - What the hell are they doing up there? - How 'bout some bologna? - Ugh. - Isn't there any place more private? - There's no place private around here. - I'm a vegetarian. - There's some rocky road ice cream. - That stuff's made with preservatives. You know that'll rot your insides. - And the guy's some kind of a nut. - [Pris] Would you like a peach? - Was it organically grown? - I don't know. - [Les] It's probably soaked with DDT. You know that stuff stays in your system? Do you have any idea what happens to you if you eat enough of it? - Ah bullshit, before the affect could be fatal a human being would have to each peaches every day, all day for 200 years. Eh. Well what's the matter? - I just lost my appetite. - If you offer anyone so much as an aspirin even without legal permission, you can be sued for malpractice, just like a doctor. - Miss Boswell. - Um-hm. - What if an accident victim needs simple mouth to mouth resuscitation? - Well if there's anyone else present who can do it, they're less likely to get in trouble. - Yes but, what if the victim is dying and that's all it takes to save him? - I understand how tough this is to swallow, but you must be aware of the risks involved. Each of you must decide for yourself. (light, jazzy music) - [Lynn] Sharon. - What? - [Lynn] How have you been? - [Pris] Did I leave my scarf in your room? - I don't think so. - I've got it Pris, I wanna use it. - Well so do I. - You could take mine, Pris, it doesn't go with my blouse. - It goes with mine. - Good, then you take Sharon's and I can have mine back. - No, you take my blouse and I'll keep your scarf. - That means that she'll have to give you her blouse then. - [Phred] Yeah, that's right. - Well I guess it makes sense. - I'm getting out of this nuthouse. - Oh, thanks for the car. - [Lynn] Sure. - Let me know when you two solve this. - Hi. - Hi. (light, jazzy music) - Can I have my scarf back? - I still may use it. - Oh. - Sharon, there's gonna be a love-in this weekend, you wanna go? - No, I don't think so. To be honest, those things bore me. Everybody just stands around and stares at each other. - Your loss. - I suppose. (light, jazzy music) - Do you wanna come with me this weekend? - Mm, I've got a date already. About that guy you brought home. - [Pris] What about him? - He's kinda creepy, isn't he? - If you mean he isn't clean cut, yeah. Only the word's freaky. - In that case, why don't you go with him? - [Pris] I don't know where he is. - Does he have a phone? - When the time comes for us to be together, it'll happen. - Mm. - [Pris] How does this look? - It looks okay, whose is it? - Mine. - I knew it. (light, jazzy music) - Hi. - Hi. Hello. - Hello. - The usual number of four female occupants at this address has temporarily been reduced to one, is this correct? - That is correct. - Any hairy young chaps with strange eating habits? - No, none. - And are you expecting any other visitors? - No. Inspector, I insist on seeing your credentials. (light, jazzy music) - [Group] Ah! Ah! (singing in foreign language) (speaking foreign language) - One day, the people of the village received a message from above concerning the injustices done to them by that tyrant Sam and his vicious police department of dogs. - [Woman] Yeah, Samuels, what are we going to do? (speaking foreign language) - My children, this is your God talking to you. I can no longer help you, so organize yourselves. - Damn outside agitator! - [Girls] Father! (growling) (girls screaming) - Not fair, you mistake my skinny legs for a bone and it hurt! - Ah, so young. - Ah, ah. - Poor Mexicans. Well, all I can do is give you this. Here's a bone for you, here's one for you. Here's a bone for you. Here's one for you, here's a bone for you, here's one for you, here's one for you. - [Girl] You know what you can do with your bone? - Here's one for you, and you. (speaking foreign language) (people chattering angrily) (speaking foreign language) (crowd yelling) - [Woman] Get your stuff together! (crowd yelling) - Louie! - [Man] Put yourself together, you put yourself together. (crowd yelling angrily) - Hey, hey, wait a minute! (speaking foreign language) Huh? - [Man] Get together. - Can anybody here give first aid? - [Man In Crowd] Point to God, get yourself together. Point to God. (slow, solemn acoustic music) - [Doctor] What happened? - He was roller skating and he failed to negotiate a turn. - Must've been going 50 miles an hour. Would you clean the laceration, please. - I know you, you were standing out there taking it all in when I was yelling for help. Huh, nurse? (light acoustic guitar music) - [Greg] You must believe that I can think nothing of you. But what has its spring in the love, which has so long been my pleasure and torment. On the night I was taken ill, when so violent a rush of blood came to my lungs that I felt nearly suffocated. I assure you, I felt it possible I might not survive. And at the moment thought of nothing but you. - That's awful. - It was written by John Keats. - Oh I don't mean the writing, I mean his condition. - His symptoms were the same as mine are. - Why do you read about things like this? - When the time comes, I wanna know how to die. - [Sharon] Greg, how long has is been since you've been away from the hospital? - Forever. - Well I have some errands to do after work today, would you like to help me? - I'd be useless. - Well, just come a long then. - What for? - Do it because I asked you. - which one? - Uh, this one. - Why? - Looks more intelligent. It's got amazingly good teeth. - I saw that. - Saw what? - You're trying to steal candy. - I wasn't stealing, I was gonna pay for it and give it you you after. - Thank you. Oh, you can give me the money later. - It's not for the candy. - Well, what's it for? - My share of the groceries. - Well, what do you mean? - It's a dinner for two, isn't it? - Well, it's actually for more than two. - So you cater to more than one at a time. - Cater? - Is it just boys or do you take on girls too? - Greg! - Well I hope and your friends have a real good time. - Greg! (soft, laid back music) - Let's go upstairs, huh baby? - We have the place to ourselves all afternoon. Just be patient and you'll appreciate it more. - Now can we go upstairs? - (laughing) No. - Please. - No! (light jazz music) - Here's just the thing for you. - What is it? - Dinner for two. - Hello? (speaking foreign language) I don't speak any Spanish, do you speak English? - I, oh, so it's you again, huh? - I'm looking for Luis Garcia. - You mean with a name like Verdugo you don't speak Spanish? You ought to be ashamed of yourself. - [Lynn] How do you know my name? - 'Cause it's spelled out in letters right over where your heart's suppose to be. - Where's Luis Garcia? - I don't know any Luiz Garcia. - You do too, you brought him to the hospital. - [Victor] I don't remember. - [Lynn] Who's Victor Charlie? - I am. - You're listed as Luiz Garcia's next of kin. - Who you working for? - Public health, who'd you think I was working for? - Well, pigs come in all shapes and sizes, how do I know you're not one? - Because you saw me at the hospital. - So what, I tell you, you tell the hospital, the hospital tells the pigs, it's the same thing. - Is Luis in trouble? - My people are always in trouble. - How did you get a name like Victor Charlie? - Because I'm the enemy. - [Lynn] What do you do here? - I publish a newspaper. I talk, I make telephone calls. - For what? - So I can tell my people what's being done to them and what they can do about it. - Your people, it was some of your people who beat up Luis. - Why don't you come back when you can speak Spanish. - You stupid bastard, the kid may have brain damage. If anything happens to him it'll be your fault. - Hey Verdugo, what are you gonna do? - I'm going to find Luis and bring him to the hospital. - Oh, you're gonna find Luis and bring him to the hospital, huh? How? Hey look, you can't go riding around town alone, you know. And nobody's gonna pay any attention to you anyway. - Get out of here. - I'm not in yet. Besides, a woman should be protected. (car engine rumbling) No matter how crazy she is. For every person on your list, there are 15 people in this neighborhood who you'll never see in the hospital, 'cause they're either afraid of the pigs or they don't make enough money to take off from work. Maybe they just don't want to wait around in the halls like cattle for some clinic doctor to see them. You see that, that lady there? That's Mrs. Delgado. Now she was hurt at work, but you won't see her in the hospital. - [Lynn] Why not? - Because, the social worker might find out she has a job, take away her welfare. She has seven kids. - I wish I could do something. - [Victor] Like what? - I wish I could get to these people, they really need help. - Oh, that's a terrific idea, man. Now what would you do about it? - Let me use your place and I'll show you. ♪ I'd tell you 'bout living ♪ But you won't believe me ♪ The reasons for grievin', ♪ They're all in your head ♪ You got no true sorrow ♪ There ain't no use tryin' ♪ Tomorrow ain't cryin', you're probably dead ♪ ♪ You hate all the present, you hate all the perfect ♪ ♪ You hate all the lawful, responsible fools ♪ ♪ You hate all the mercy, you hate all the justice ♪ ♪ You're hating so awful, it's one of your tools ♪ ♪ It's which way to listen ♪ And who shall I turn to ♪ I got all the answers ♪ And here's all you need ♪ It's like that, we're missing ♪ ♪ We lose 'cause we learn to ♪ We turn in our fancy to burn in our grief ♪ ♪ If rightful possession is what you are after ♪ ♪ Start looking around you and see what you are ♪ ♪ It's too long I've danced to your self-conscious laughter ♪ ♪ I'll thank your obsessions to get off of my throne ♪ ♪ I'd tell you 'bout livin', but you won't believe me ♪ ♪ You got reasons for grievin', they're all in your head. ♪ ♪ You got no true sorrow ♪ There ain't no use tryin' ♪ Tomorrow ain't cryin' and my song's been said ♪ (happy pop music) ♪ A lover of life means I'm livin' for love ♪ ♪ And that's why I'm givin' the love to you ♪ ♪ Lovin' is one thing that there ain't enough of ♪ ♪ And that's why it's all 'bout love with you ♪ ♪ Well if you really want it ♪ Just let me know ♪ And if you really need it ♪ Just let me know ♪ You better believe it ♪ I told you so ♪ I'm livin' for love, I'm living for love ♪ (happy pop music) - When I saw you messin' around with my bike, I knew it. You're lookin' very hard to find somethin'. - So? - So you found it. - So tell me what it is. - Me. - (chuckling) Oh no, I never could survive an organic diet. - It is written that man shall not survive by food alone, but by every drug that produced in the divine pharmacy. - How can you be a health food freak and still take synthetic drugs? - It isn't synthetic. You get beyond where you end and in to where it all begins. - [Pris] But LSD stays in your system. - So does oxygen, so does protein, so does salt, so does water. Look at it this way. (motorcycle engine humming) (70s pop music) (gentle music) Look at it this way, drugs are around and they're gonna stay around. As a nurse, you better know something about them. The only way to learn is to take them yourself. (light music) - [Pris] I'm scared. - [Victor] What's the worse thing that could happen? - [Pris] I'd be all alone, forever. [Victor] I'll be with you all the time. (birds chirping) (slow, solemn music) (waves crashing) Making it, is making it. But acid makes it ectasy. - [Pris Voiceover] I don't feel anything. - [Victor] Hold on, it's coming. (waves thundering) (slow, solemn music) (gentle music) (tense music) - [Pris] Stop it, stop looking at me. (waves crashing) (birds singing) (gentle music) - She didn't touch anything but the coffee. - Has she come out of it yet? - Doesn't look like it. - If I'd only gone with her to that love-in she wouldn't be this way. She asked me to go too, Sharon. - That makes three of us. - Look, we can't take all the blame. She knows a guy like that is trouble and she went after him anyway. - Yeah, but jeez, I could've gotten her laid if that's all she wanted. Least I'd have found her a guy with a bed. Oh, look who's here. - How're you feeling? - Pretty good. - Any side effects? - Phred, what's that lizard doing in your lap? (laughing) (mellow music) (water splashing) - Come back in two days, on Thursday, and I'll change the dressing, don't forget. - Si. - Bueno. Did you get my supplies? - Huh, yeah. (light acoustic guitar music) - I suppose you got these to help sell newspapers. - No, I got them to make sure the newspaper stays in business. We got pigs to contend with. - You have enough to wage a war. - That's right. - You're just asking for trouble. - Well that way, maybe we won't be surprised when it comes. - I can't treat people in the middle of an arsenal. - Then don't, 'cause nobody asked you. - [Phred] Are we kicking you out of the house? - No, I'm on my way to work. - Good. - Phred, I've got a proposition for you. - What? - I'm going to practice with a psychiatrist in Beverly Hills, we'll be needing a girl. - As a receptionist? - You'll make a great addition to the decor. - But you need a secretary, not a nurse. - Let's go. - Go meet the guy, maybe he'll change your mind. - I've gotta be back on duty at four. - Then you better make it fast. I'm sorry, Phred. - Come on Phred, huh? Can't you hold off for five minutes? - Sure I can. (sighing) - Look, today a pregnant chic was brought in for observation. She'd been having difficulties, but nobody expected any troubles, least of all me. All the sudden, she goes into labor. Bad pains. Couldn't save either of them. What the hell are you doing over there? - I'm staying away from you. - You're upset? - You're damn right, I'm upset. Do you know why I like you being a gynecologist? - [Jim] Convenience? - No, because it's a very clean area of medicine. There're very few people who die of female diseases. - [Jim] So? - So I don't like to hear about people dying. I don't want it brought into my private life, especially my sex life. - [Jim] It's always good to learn the rules. What do I do now? - That's up to you. (mellow piano music) There's one more rule. Never turn the light out. (gentle piano music) (birds chirping) - I've asked to have you transferred. Your efforts are wasted on me. Perhaps some other patient would appreciate you more. - I did those things for you, with somebody else I might not have. - Well, you'll have a chance to find out now, won't you? - You really are angry with me, aren't you? - It's just another patient won't be quite as nasty as I am. - You're proud of being nasty. - I am not. - Yes, you are, you like hurting people. - That's a lie. - Well I've got news for you. I'm not to blame because you thought I was buying you dinner when I wasn't. And I'm not responsible for your disease either. - Sharon. - Where would you like to go? - Nowhere, I wanna be with you. I like you, that's why I was so mad. - Well, I like you too. - Would you do me a favor? - Anything. - Would you run for me, I wanna watch you. - You mean just run around? - Yeah. (light, uplifting music) - Jim. You gotta run a test on me. (people chattering) - Your AZ showed positive. - I'm pregnant. ♪ I stand alone on empty streets ♪ ♪ Away from all, no one can see ♪ ♪ How bright the day, how dark the night ♪ ♪ How sweet love is when you're with me ♪ ♪ We thought alike, we were together ♪ ♪ Although we knew, it's not forever ♪ ♪ I can't explain, just how I feel ♪ ♪ We're days apart, and months later ♪ ♪ No fear in my heart, no doubt in my mind ♪ ♪ No rain in the sky, no more gold to find ♪ ♪ And it is true ♪ As days go by, I never cry when I'm with you ♪ ♪ We don't have much ♪ But love to share ♪ A gentle touch ♪ Feeling your hair ♪ We catch the wind, follow a star ♪ ♪ Perhaps we'll never know how far ♪ (gentle music) - So I'll have it, that's all. - Oh yeah, I'd forgotten it's hip to be an unwed mother. - Pris, that's gonna be damn difficult to do on a nurse's salary. - So I won't be a nurse. - You should get the father to support you. - By the way Pris, who is the father? - Oh it's that creep, that health nut, you know. - Don't you call him a creep, he's a guy. It could've been any guy. It's my fault I forgot to take the pills, not his. This whole mess is my fault. So I'll live on the streets for awhile and get checkups at the free clinic. - [Caspar] Priscilla, you've gotta be realistic. - If I have an abortion, I only want a legal one. - Okay, apply at the hospital. If you can convince the psychiatrist that having a baby will threaten your mental health, you're in. - Won't they kick me out of school? - No, I don't think so. But don't 'em about the LSD, that'll get you kicked out. - I guess it's my only choice. - I think so. - Then I better get started. - Pris, when you go for the interview, wear a bra, okay? - Okay. - [Psychiatrist] What I decide won't be all of it. The hospital's therapeutic abortion board makes the final decision, understand? - Mm-hm. - [Psychiatrist] Have you had a lot of sexual contact with him? - No, this was our first, but. - [Psychiatrist] But what? - But I knew I was gonna. - [Psychiatrist] What's bothering you? - Nothing. - [Psychiatrist] Well if you wanted to do something private I'll look the other way. - No, it's just that I never-- - [Psychiatrist] Yes? - Forget it. - [Psychiatrist] Why didn't you try to prevent the pregnancy? - Who says I didn't? - [Psychiatrist] Well you're not here because of the flu. - No, he just wandered off. - [Psychiatrist] And that upset you? - At first, but when I got straight, I mean when I thought it over, it didn't. - [Psychiatrist] Why not? - Because he wasn't worth it. - [Psychiatrist] Have you ever attempted suicide? - Thought about it, but that's all. - [Psychiatrist] And your feelings about the baby? - I wished it weren't there. - [Psychiatrist] Do you always enjoy sex? - Sort of. - [Psychiatrist] Do you have any allergies? - None so far. - This isn't the only hospital in this city. - It's the only one for me. - Hello. Have you heard anything? - Yeah, negative. - Wouldn't you know it. (sighing) Now what? - Look around I guess, and see what else I can do. - And while you're running around looking all over, there'll be girls just like yourself, getting abortions right here in this hospital. - Then why not me? - Because the board's afraid that the district attorney will think that they're stretching the law, simply because you're a student here. Have you thought about going to a private hospital? - I can't afford it. - Do me a favor, Priscilla, get yourself a safe one, or don't get one at all. - What do you expect from a bunch of men? You give 'em the chance to play inquisitor and it's thumbs down on women every time. Just like the monks did to Joan of Arc. - If my hair was shorter, that's who I'd be. - Well of course, Joan of Arc was crazy. - They gave her a chance to save herself by admitting she was nuts, but she didn't take it. - I'm not a good pretender. - Oh, come on, after today, none of this will matter. - What's going on here? - We're preparing for surgery. - You're kidding. What kind of surgery? You're getting your abortion? Why wasn't I told? - We didn't think you'd approve. - Well you thought right. - [Jim] Anybody home? Hey, where is everybody? - The abortionist, I presume. - That's me. - You're not going up there. Nobody's gonna get their insides scraped in my bedroom. - Phred have a little sense. - You could lose your license if they hear about this. - [Jim] Who's going to tell them? - Pris, are you gonna let this bastard kill your baby? - Get the hell outta my way. - Not in my bedroom, not in my bed. You go do your butchering somewhere else! No! - Cut it out! (gasping) (Phred crying) Now settle down! (Phred grunting) - You son of a bitch! I hope you all get kicked out of this lousy profession! (people chattering) - Hi. (light jazz music) (sighing) - Are you comfortable Pris? Is the anesthetic working? - [Pris] Mm-hm. (Pris breathing deeply) - Ease up a little, relax. Feel anything? - No. - [Psychiatrist] And your feelings about the baby? - I wished it weren't there. - [Psychiatrist] Have you had a lot of sexual contact with him? Why didn't you try to prevent the pregnancy? - I don't know, I don't know. - You okay? - Yes, thank you. - Hold on, it's coming. - [Psychiatrist] Hold on, it's coming. It's coming, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming. (Pris breathing deeply) (dramatic music) (tense music) - Everything's over babe. Everything's fine. How are ya? - How do I look? - I can't see how you feel. - I'm fine, thank you. - How can you be? - Then I'm not fine. - Are you gonna report me? - I don't play dirty. - According to Mark you do. - Look, what I do with my body is my own business. - What about us? - I told you to keep that stuff out of our private life. - Break one rule and you get drummed out of the corp. Is that right, Sergeant? - If you did it one time, you'll do it again. - Live a little, learn a lot. - We didn't mess the place up, you'll notice. - Oh I don't care, really. - You did yesterday. - That's all taken care of, I broke up with Jim. - Oh? Can I ask you a personal question? - Sure. - It's a question the psychiatrist asked me. Do you always enjoy it with Jim? - Yes. - Well it wasn't so great with Les. Not even with acid. It's never really been good with any guy. - That's true with a lot of people. - He got his kicks and dumped on me, why? - Because you take up with guys who dump. You just have to make sure with the next one. - Maybe there shouldn't be a next one. Maybe I should try something else. - Priscilla, you've just had an abortion. Finals aren't very far away, we could study together, might cheer you up. - Okay. - Name, please. - Lynn Verdugo. - What? - V-E-R-D-U-G-O. - You're late. - Yes, I was delayed by a public health problem. (speaking foreign language) - The pigs. - Sh. - The pigs got Manuel, man. Maybe he's dead, I don't know. Ralpho got away, made it to my house. It's bad, man. - Are the pigs still around? - They're always around, man. - Did you see any? - Not yet, but I got bad feelings. My grandmother, she can't stop crying. - How is he? - It's still in there, you've got to get him to a hospital. - Look man, the man's got a cop's bullet in him. You wanna take him to the hospital, huh? So what, so he'll go to jail? - It's a bad wound, he needs a doctor. - All he needs is somebody to take it out. - Well I'm not qualified. - [Victor] Well you're more qualified than any one of us. - I won't do it, I'm not gonna take the risk. - Okay, then you better leave, 'cause we don't want any halfway people around here. Either you're with us or you're against us. - All right Victor, I need some uh, uh, boiling water, yes, and uh, uh, liquor, unless somebody has some morphine. (telephone ringing) - Hello. Yeah, the pigs got Martin at his place, man. - Okay that means they're gonna be here soon. (yelling in pain) - It still has to be sewn up, and get a tetanus shot, with antibiotic. - But now that the bullet's out we can take him to a doctor, right? (knocking at door) - Open up, police. - Hey quiet. - Shh. - It them, let's get outta here. (gunshot blasting) - Dammit, Louie! (gunshots popping) (gunshots popping) (gunshots popping) (mellow acoustic music) (tires squealing) (mellow acoustic music) - [Lynn] You didn't shoot first. - It doesn't matter, you so much as point a gun at a pig and you've had it. Turn in here. Okay, okay now, just pull over here and park it. Turn it off, turn it off. - What now? - I hide. - [Lynn] Where? - Lots of places. My brothers'll take care of me. - What am I gonna do? - [Victor] That's up to you, I don't think you were seen. - I guess I could stick with you. - If you do that, you'll save me the trouble of asking. - Let's go before I chicken out. (light guitar music) (tires squealing) (gentle piano music) - Sharon. - How do you feel? What is it? - Read something. - What would you like? - [Greg] Anything. - Well, I've got The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, but that's a child's story, I'll find something else. - It's not a child's story, it's fine, read it. - Well, I'll just start any place. The sun was all warm and the birds were kicking up a ruckus, but old Jim was snoring just like a baby. So I snuck away to go exploring and-- - Exploring, I never went exploring. I never went to the moon either, big deal. - [Sharon] Greg. - I just wanna run around the block, just once. Drive a car by myself, or take out a girl. I wanted to write poetry too. - Well that's something you could do, why don't you try it? - Will you write it down for me? The shadows in my room point one way and then the other. Hospitals are quiet like churches are suppose to be. I'm not making it rhyme. - That's all right. - Why couldn't it have been somebody else? Somebody who'd done a lot of things and then got sick. I never got to do anything. - Is that part of the poem? - They might be wrong, they might find a cure. Sharon, how close are they to finding a cure? - Greg, why don't you try and get some sleep. You'll feel better tomorrow. - Sharon, come here. - [Sharon] What is it? - I don't wanna go to sleep. - Sure you do. - I'm afraid to. I'm afraid I won't wake up. (gentle piano music) Please don't go. - I'm not. (gentle piano music) - [Phred] Hi. - The exam results have been posted. - What happened? - I don't know, we haven't gone to look yet. - Pris was scared to. - Well I don't know about you guys, but I wanna find out. - How long will you be gone? - Oh just for a few minutes. - You'll catch hell if you leave him alone. - Joyce, would you keep an eye on Greg? - Sure. - [Nurse] You wanna get an A, don't you? - Oh, I don't know guys, I don't really care-- - Everybody's made it. - Lynn too? - Yes. - Come on, we gotta tell her. - We have to find her first. 10 years from now we'll all run into each other at a cocktail party and we won't remember anybody's name. - I won't forget your names. - Oh it's possible, I can't remember any of the names of the people I went to grammar school with. - Well, here's to the girl who wanted to drop out. - [Sharon] Who are you thinking of? - All of us. - I was thinking of Lynn. - Um, I left Greg out on the grounds, see you. (tense pounding music) - [Announcer] Dr. Robert Pierce, Dr. Robert Pierce, please report to station six. - [Sharon] Where is he? - He suffered a massive hemorrhage on the way to intensive care, he died. - Oh! (crying) - Mourning is for loved ones, Miss Armitage, not for nurses, it's a luxury they can't afford. (slow, sorrowful music) - Yesterday, yesterday he was mad, angry because he never could have any fun, he couldn't. He was always thinking about what was going to happen. Today, he forgot. We sat together for a long time and he never once mentioned it. (sighing) Maybe he was ready. I should've been there. We waited together for such a long time, I should've been with him, it's just not fair. Dammit, it's just not fair. (gentle acoustic guitar music) - Bad news first, Tony was busted trying to get away. - And the good news? - And Luis is dead. But the cop you shot is still alive. - Well, I guess I'll just have to do some target practice. - That means you're not a murderer, aren't you glad? - I still shot a pig. - But now you can plead self-defense. - (sighing) You know, you're crazy like you always were, Lynn, huh? Look, if a man shoots a cop, it doesn't make a difference what he pleads. Especially, especially if he's a dirty Mexican. - You can't hide out forever. - Yeah, who says? Remember they're my enemies. A man doesn't surrender to his enemies unless he has no choice, I still have a choice. If I'm in jail, all my work stops. At least, at least this way I'll be able to continue it somehow. - How, on the telephone? - Possibly, yeah. - Victor, it's hopeless, you know it is. You're not gonna do any good at all. You'll suffer and suffer and nobody'll care, and then the cops'll come, and that'll be that anyway. - Okay, shut up! Now if you're gonna talk that kinda talk, man, you can go away from here, uh? Far away! - You'll spend years in filthy places like this. Moving every week, eating out of cans. How are you gonna stand it? - You're not worried about me standing it, it's how are you gonna stand it? - I don't wanna be a criminal. - Well, you're not the only one. - I won't go, Victor, I won't leave. - [Victor] Thank you. - Don't thank me, I do it for La Causa. - What about Victor Charlie, will you stay for him? - [Lynn] Si. - And, what will you do for him? - What do you need, Victor? - I need you. - I'm here. - How do you like it? - Smashing, graduation outfits always look good. - I'm going to open it. - Well? - She's been accepted at the Metropolitan Hospital. - When does she have to respond? - By the 15th, that's next Tuesday. - Maybe we should tell them that she's missing. - They're not gonna hold a job for her, dumb dumb. (knocking at door) - [Pris] I didn't know gynecologists made house calls. - [Jim] How do you feel, Priscilla? - Absolutely fantastic. - Good. So you're going to Vietnam? - Um-hm. - Greg won't be there, you know. How long do you think you can stand it before you get bored? - Stand what? - Sitting in Mark's office answering telephones. - Maybe forever. - I don't believe it. - Psychiatry's a very clean area of medicine. - I suppose you'll never change your rules. - No, I can't. - You've ruined it for me, you know. - What? - Screwing, it was perfect with you. - With us. - Do you girls what a ride? - Phred, what do you say? - You guys go ahead, I'll hitch later. - I guess not. - Forgot to give you back your key. Don't give any overdoses. Peace. (door clicking shut) - What a bunch of dopes, now we have to hitch. - What's that? - For Lynn. - You don't expect her to show up, do you? - No. (upbeat acoustic guitar music) - [Pris] Where the hell have you been? - Don't ask. - What about your outfit? - [Lynn] It's for my new job. - [Pris] Here, you better read this first. - Wow, I'm impressed. - Does this mean you're giving up nursing? - No, I'm becoming a different kind of nurse. - Doing what? - People have always gone to hospitals, now that has to change. No matter what, hospitals have got to go to the people. - Oh, and you're the one who's going to do this. - Who've you been shacking up with, Chairman Mao? (both laughing) Here, these are for you. - No thanks, I'll wear these. - Are you serious? - Oh great, it's easy to wear fatigues, but what're you gonna do in the crunch? - Whatever I have to do. - Okay, Florence Nightingale, where's your gun? - In the glove compartment, wanna look? - Well, nothing stands still I guess. - You bet your ass, baby.
