This is what a true black girl looks like. Get that out of my face bro. No! - Like, solid A+ - No… She's ugly! She got no titties, no ass! Nothing! Naw, that's not for me, dawg. What are you smoking today? I'm smoking this, all day… I don't know…Them feet look kinda crusty, in my opinion… - Who is that? Whoa Vicky? - Did you flush bro?! Flush it! Jayden, what you think about this? He's tripping… Look… Ugh, I just had it…look… You telling me you choosing that? - She don't got no attributes. - Jayden, back me up! She look like the girls here! No. Just look, just look… No, like-we at school… Nigga, where do you talk- I talk about bitches at school, at home, when I'm on a toilet… It don't matter Like…no… - We know you got some bitches saved… - Come on bro. This ain't the place and time to be doing this… Like, we in a school bathroom. If I hear you say 'we at school' one more time nigga… You get a boner at school. What's the difference? People don't notice. - Well like… - You can hide it… So? We can hide this shit! Look at the way they dress on Instagram! They clearly want niggas to look at them. And follow, and like… Cause they get paid and we get paid… By looking at all that ass… and titties. - Come on bro… - Like, you do you.. You're telling me that this woman is not putting everything on display? This is just for her female friends? Her whole account! There's five hundred and thirty one posts of just her ass and titties! In bathing suits! It's clear what the goal of this account is! There's women… And then there's bitches. That's what we're trying to get right now. There is a difference between the two, okay? And that's what we're out to get right now… Let me know when you find some women! Cause…it's just bitches around here. There's bitches - and then there's ugly bitches. - I'm not mad about it… - Hmm…Are you sure? No, I don't care because I don't like him. - But it just like, it sucks. - You don't like him anymore? I don't 'not like him' but it just sucks to like constantly be the last option. No, but I don't want you to be mad at me because I didn't choose for it to happen. It's not just him it's just like it feels like a lot of times it's like: You, someone else, someone else and then me at the bottom of the list. It's like-I'm misunderstood. As like, “the friend” every single fucking time Well, like, if you you wanna attract people. Make yourself attractive. Because the shit you wear… Just, like… I wanna help you! I wanna help you! Your shorts are just holes with extra fabric! There is no short there! You look like a boy today… I wonder what goes on in there. I do too, bro. I don't know! It's like-it's empty! - I know! If I, like, cut it open… - There's nothing. What is it, 'solid'? Hollow. What you think is attractive to guys is this! What I know is attractive to guys is this! My type is guys that don't want you to dress… I wouldn't to say… you know…like you… But I don't even dress for guys… I dress up because I don't want myself to look ugly. Not saying that you look ugly! Everything I'm saying is kinda fucked right now! I don't follow what other people do. I try to like choose what I want - to wear and what I think is sick. - I can tell! I try to not do what other people do! You're yourself! Boys are visual. When they first spot you in a room. Let's say there's a hot guy over there. They aren't looking for your personality. If they see a hot girl, they're gonna wanna come talk to you. But if you look like a trash bag they're just gonna ignore you! People say “I like personality” But no one's gonna come over to you If they don't think you're attractive. This is the key to making guys like you, or want you Jaya. Just listen, closely. Let's say, you see a hot guy… on the other side of the room. Look at him. Wait for him to look back at you. Get his attention just somehow. Like, keep your eyes on him. Focus. As soon as they look at you-look away. That's how you gotta do it. Don't nod your head. You guys are going to look at each other a couple of times. And at some point. He's going to get up and he's gonna come talk to you. Maybe ask for your Snapchat. Have a little convo. I don't get how you can just do these things unworried. Because like-YOLO it bro! That shit just doesn't happen to me. It's just not the same for me. Well it can be. Just try. Like, don't like try in the way that you think you're supposed to. Just like give it a shot. Like literally YOLO it! - You keep saying YOLO it, but- - But it's just like, do it! Who's the hottest in like, all the high school? In all the high school? Well, I mean- there's like a tie. It's like, it's like- It's like between Ava It's also like between, like, Jaqueline- What?! There's many, many possibilities in the number one spot And I can't decide which one goes in that number one spot. Name me one time you ever fucking touched a girl without her spazzing? Two years ago Who? Name- Bella Candle That girl-You touched her-what did you do? Explain to me. I kissed her on the lips. You kissed her on the lips?! If I DM'ed her! Oh my God! Wait, wait, wait - hold up - No way! - You need evidence? No way. - You can ask her… - So if I asked her, would she say yes? I dunno... that's her decision not mine. Question, question, question... So if this is truthful… Per say… Was this... a dare? It was not technically a dare… But it was a game. - How was the... - It was a game. What was the game? So basically... it was a 'Rock, paper, scissors' game So I chose two people And they played 'Rock Paper Scissors” and whoever lost, had to... - Had to, had to... - Had to kiss you? - Yeah... she lost. - Alright… - How long was the kiss for? - Not, not long. So like, 30 seconds? Silas, you're so fucking clearly picking on Josh cause you literally haven't gotten with anyone. No. Josh is fucking older than me, one. And two- That doesn't count as getting with someone! Silas, you still haven't kissed anyone! What's your defense? Alright, alright. I just don't think... I don't want to fucking waste it on some fucking like Bella whatever her fucking name is. Josh, was she hot? - Yes. - She was hot. - No way. - Yes, she was. I don't want to, regardless, I wanna... You wanna see a picture? No, quiet! Shut the fuck up! - Yeah, show the picture. - No, shut the fuck up! I want my first time to be like with someone who I fucking like share something with you know That I have some of relation to, not just because she's hot… Gayyyy! No! I'm just saying it's something you remember your whole fucking life just like he fucking lost it on a game where it was like: “Bro, I definitely don't wanna lose this game!” like I want it... - I want it to mean something. - Who is it that you're saving yourself for? It doesn't matter... it doesn't matter, all right? At all. Dude, we've all known who it is since sixth grade, so like... Swear on your mom it's not Ava. Like, you've literally been wanting to get with her since like sixth grade. What does it matter if it is Ava? Cause you have no fucking chance. Dude, you haven't had a chance since sixth grade and she's dating a senior now. - It's like, she's... - She's not dating a fucking senior. - Yes she is. You haven't heard? - Who? Who? Deyshane Hey! So... that project you did it was, like, really good… Oh thank you. Yeah. I put a lot of work into it. Like I was wondering, maybe you could help me with like the drive train? Like once in a while. Oh yeah totally. You're really good though you assembled the whole drive train frame, and like all of the, um… Uh, gearboxes. - Yeah, gearboxes. They're really good. - Thank you. Um, well I had another question really. I know. Like I really like you I don't know. Like you're funny and everything like you're new too. So I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to prom with me. Umm… You're a really... great person and I really think that. Umm… I think you're great but I don't think that I would like to go to prom. - No it's fine. - I understand. I totally get it. I understand that like we're friends and you probably don't wanna… do anything like that so… You don't want to risk a friendship. - Yeah… - I understand Well, in robotics I can help you with the drive train… - just let me know. I can help. - That's cool. - So... I'll see you around. - Okay. Honestly- It's so fucking annoying. Because every time, I like... Like a girl or have feelings for a girl. Like any girl specifically. There's always some fucking older guy. And I'm like when I'm a senior. Am I gonna be fucking hitting on freshman girls or shit like that? No. It's not appealing to me. Why can't they just - stay in their own fucking lane? - Yeah. That's true. It doesn't make sense to me that people can have like feelings for someone older who's going to college. Who's doing all this shit you know trying to get into college. He's this guy and he's not in your world he's in a completely different life stage than you. And you're trying to like share emotion with him share feelings with him when there's someone in your grade who's going through the exact same shit that you're going through if you don't see it and you're not kind of focusing on them you're trying to find something bigger better to show off to people. It just fucking... So retarded. I mean, bro. You're kinda, like, upping the bar… …like way too much. You're trying to go for the biggest and the best… You kinda gotta just like… …keep it on the low. What do you mean by that? I mean, You're trying to go for the most popular girl. You know? Like…obviously… I mean you're probably nothing to her, you know. So like… You gotta lower the bar, bro! I just don't get it. I really care for her. I really like to share something with her and she just doesn't see it. I don't know if she does see it. That's the thing. Maybe she does. Maybe she's not telling me. Maybe she's hiding something. But in my eyes, we had these moments in eighth grade… And now it's just. She's doesn't even notice me. At. Fucking. All. Anything. She'll laugh with me- She'll do all this shit… But there's no real connection anymore and I actually fucking care for her. Not like this fucking Senior twat. What do you want? I'm so tired of this… You've called me, like A hundred times. In the past like five minutes. Do you understand when someone declines your calls They don't want to talk to you. I'm stressed with this situation. Last week, like, you were talking to me all night. I didn't understand because I couldn't... Stop fucking calling me! It's fucking ridiculous. Leave me alone. - Hey! - Fuck off! “Blonde bitch!” I don't understand why you can't just leave me alone. Obviously that in the end like I wanted you to want me, You used to like me… How you used to love me so much but now I'm not really sure. This is the second time it's happened too. I'm not the first person. I don't. I don't want to talk to you anymore. You don't need to talk to me like I'm obviously not important. Obviously I'm not good enough. Just fuck off! And don't ever talk to me again. And don't like have your friends try to talk to me. I don't want to hear it. Look. I don't care. I don't care if you're sorry I don't care. Whatever. Bye. Do you know what I got on the math test? I got, like, a twenty out of fifty! Well of course you did… you're stupid. No. I'm stupid about school things. I'm not stupid about other things. Tell me who's president of the United States right now! Trump! Tell me he's running for president of the United States right now. Bernie-Is that his name? Like, the big… …purple dinosaur? - What the fuck? - That's Barney! You fuck! Hey you wanna do me a big favor and buy me lunch? Not at all. We were in the middle of a conversation. Go away, you peasant! Not at all! Please. Just something little. - What do you mean something little? - I'll pay you back! - You have my word! - No, I don't believe your word. I'll pay you back… How will you pay me back? With… Love and support… Yeah. With love and affection. No, I want money. OK. Money and love and affection. You do not have money to pay me back even five bucks bro. - I swear. - What? This is the only day that I don't have money. Every single day. I promise you I'll pay you back! The amount of the waters that I've helped you pay for. - Absolutely not. - He probably has money. He's just trying to get more from you. Or maybe I'm just looking for an excuse to talk to you guys. Come on, please… Just five bucks. That's all I need. Will you go away if I give you the money? I will go away and I will never talk to you again. You swear? This is so stupid! - Do you swear? On God? - Sure. - Okay, fine. - Actually? Yes, if you fucking leave! You have to use this and then bring it back. All right I will. Thank you. I have cash. Why wouldn't you give it…? No, I was saying I could give it to you to give it to him. Why would you give me your money to give to someone else? Because it's obvious there's like. Something going on between you guys… - No there…Are you…Bash?! - Yeah. - Are you fucking kidding? - I can tell! I'm not blind. You are! You guys were literally flirting right in front of me! - Absolutely not! - Yes you were. - Absolutely not! - The way he was looking at you… He wasn't asking me for anything. He was just asking you. He was trying to find an excuse to talk to you! 'Cause he knows I have money! He wants food! He doesn't want to talk to me. He wants to go get some shit with my money! How does he not know that I have money? 'Cause I do have money. - No, you don't! - Yes I do! I have four dollars in my backpack! - He obviously likes you… - Obviously not. You know nothing. You confuse Bernie and Barney! That doesn't mean I don't know love! Fine! Be in... What's it called? Nah, I don't know what I was gonna say. Being? Word check… Denial! I mean… Be in denial. - You want me to be in denial? - No, you are in denial! Denial of what? There's denial of nothing…! Of the feelings between you guys. I can tell! - Do you like him? - No! Absolutely not. - I now you're lying. - I know you're lying bro! Shut up! I'm not lying! Lying about what? Lying about what I saw, exactly…? You're stupid! This is why you never find anyone Jaya… This is what you always tell me. He just came over here! He wasn't asking me for anything if he was that desperate he would have asked everybody at the table not just you. He was literally stuck on asking you He was like “Jaya! Jaya! No, not you! Jaya!” - Maybe he already did ask other people… - No, he didn't! - He didn't! - You don't know that! I was sitting right here the whole entire lunch. He didn't ask anyone except you. Just sayin'. - I don't… - Just sayin' bro… Yeah, yeah, yeah… Just like don't get pissed off cause I know you don't have a good temper. - OK, don't make that face at me. - Whatever, proceed. Okay. Umm… People have been saying that like you're fucking her… - What are you talking about? - I heard this shit from Lucas… - Who said that? - …Dylan, Kevin…like… …all these kids. This freshman guy that I don't even know - but he asked me about it… - What are you talking about?! She keeps saying that you guys are dating. No I'm not dating her. And- Go back to that. So... A bunch of kids have come up to you, sayin' I'm hooking up with her… Yeah. - Elaborate! What the fuck? - She's saying it! I don't know! But I wanna tell you so you don't get in trouble. - She's like 15 or 16, right? - Yeah. Yeah, but you're 18. Yeah… I dunno…This is what I heard. You really think I would do that? How long you known me? And you believe them over me? Bro, 'cause I've known them for the same amount of time! Regardless…regardless… How well do you know me, then? How well do you know me, then? Cause you're being all defensive right now. Bro, of course I am! Why are you even hanging out with her? I can be friends with her, I just can't hook up with her! You really got to take care of this shit. I'm going to. I'm going to. I'm literally about to. I will go speak to her. You know how much I care about you. That's why I'm bringing it up. I know! It's fucking... it's impactful for me too. I know I know. So take care of this shit. I will, I will. I'm going back to class. I've been gone way too long. There's nothing wrong because literally it is a three year difference. When I'm 30 he'll be 33. - That's completely fucking normal - That's really normal. Yeah. Except right now it's like oh wait - he's an adult and you're like a freshman… - But like, not even... If you're really thinking about it, his brain isn't even developed, - and neither is mine. - That's true. So, like not. Like you're kinda like older than him Mentally. Definitely not. Definitely not! It's still like…I dunno… Okay, it's only... An issue if someone has an issue. If his mom found out that you were like. One year younger. His mom knows I'm 15 I thought you said she knows you're 16? Well I mean 16, but like I'll be 16 soon, so... But like, he's leaving in May. To go to where? To graduate. Where's he going to college? - New York! - That's so sad. But is it weird that he's so much older than you? Not really because, like, I'd much rather be with someone who is a mature human being, than a 15 year old retard. Yeah, but like, right now- He's at a completely different stage in his life He's going to college. You're gonna be in high school for the next 3 years. - Oh trust me, I know! - Have you guys had talks about that? Yes. We have. - I honestly ship it. You guys are like... - So do I. It works-mentally. I mean physically too! Like - Not yet, but we'll get there. - It's happening. - OK, so I'm literally getting looks from every single senior girl like I swear to God every time I walk by... It's cause you're taking all their baes. That's like... They all like want him, and… Cause he just got out of a relationship and then he got out of it for... they're all just kinda tripping out. You're gonna get some looks. That's tea. That's tea of the century. OK, he's like he's like literally like telling me he's like I will check up on you next year, like every single day and I'm like That's gonna be hard though. Because, like, you're going to meet new people. And he's going to meet new people. It's going to end up fine. You guys are going to be friends or something else. In your vagina... - You know! - There's something, like... That's gross. Let me go introduce you to some of my friends I think you'll like them. We can eat some lunch with them. There's nothing to do here… Just don't be weird. You're fine. They're just people. Grant, you wanna take a seat? Everybody! This is Grant. My little brother. Sit next to Emma if you want to.

Don't say I haven't… I tried the other day. - So, what happened? - I got rejected. Gotta be aggressive sometimes… Gotta be like: “Wassup bitch!” “My name is Jayden Capers!

I dunno. Just kinda boring. Like they have their interests, I have my interests… And they're different. - Yeah. - What were they interested in? It's like… “Oh my God!

At first it was kinda pink but… - Whenever it dries it goes clear… - How long ago did you do that? Like a little under a week ago. What are you gonna use it for? Like, the pencil is gonna go in my eye. Like another pencil, that doesn't have this stuff on it. It's like a movie. And I'll be like: “Ahhh, it hurts!” And I'm gonna pull it out. Then I'll have ketchup go out or something… Oh, cool. - When are you gonna do that? - Probably today. - Here, we can see how it works! - No, let's not see how it works! In between your armpit.

You see how it's like drifting like that's all because of your pieces being crooked and everything. OK. First off. At the end of the day what you do with the pieces is all you. - You're the one who bolted them in! - I didn't bolt anything in! You put screw, not bolts, “screws”. Sorry! The screws are almost grinding against the ground. They look pretty well off the ground, for me. See how most of it is hanging off or inside the wood. It is like inside the frame. It is not a straight! Somebody told me the dimensions I cut the wood. Whatever happens after that… The dimensions didn't call for a curve in it. That's like a one degree curve That is definitely not one degree… That's like a 180 degree curve. Because it's flat and not a curve at all. 180 degree curve… - This is a 180 degree line. - That's… - The line! - No, but we're talking about the curve! Technicalities. Your construction was poor. So what are we doing today? Anywhooo… What are you tryna do this weekend? Gonna be fixing this. You know I got to grease up these gearboxes Reset them to what? I gotta grease the gearboxes up… - That's what Oscar said. - Oh I still gotta work on the X-Carve. - I should be in the shed-alone. - Wait-for real. - You're the one who was in the shed? - Yeah! Oscar said he would get a speaker so it's better in there. - Oh yeah, he was like ”Should I get a... - So you do, like… I'm just fuckin' with the X-Carve. Trying to figure it out. And make it happen. Because like this the whole manufacturing I won't need any lackeys if I can get the X-Carve to work. 'Cause the box in there is fucked like we just figured out the electronics is not working. - So once we get all this? - Yeah. Jayden's a bitch! We both bitches. You had two pigeons. - Were those pigeons or doves? - Those were pigeons… Pigeons. Okay. So yeah. So this is I have some birds… Oh. Nice. Okay, so… When you had your pigeons Which were different than the doves because you took a bunch of pictures of morning doves and identified them. What did you see that was different between your pigeons and the dove? They're more friendly… I can I can walk up to pigeons more than I can do with morning doves. That's absolutely true. And it's not because one's domesticated and one's not. Which is what a lot of people think. It's just that the morning dove evolved in a situation where… …being afraid-or leery of anything large… …was a bigger deal. Where the rock dove; the rock pigeon- Ummm…is not… Doesn't have that same fear. It didn't evolve that same fear. So I was thinking, in weddings- When they release the doves- Do they just fly away? Yeah, and those are almost always pigeons because you don't want to say: “In honor of your marriage here's a bunch pigeons.” It's the pure race of Columbadae. Yes, yes…exactly! Grant… - C'mon, let's get outside… - I really don't want to. I have nothing to do out there… - Grant, we're gonna get outside… - Michael, Michael-hang on… Let's go outside for just a second. I'll be right back Lemme just talk for a minute. - He's not socializing… - None of that. I think I know where you're coming from And I know it's a really good place. I really appreciate you being involved in your little brother. But you have to remember that… He's trying to find his way Everybody's social; everybody's outside And he's stuck in here… Everyone knows what he's doing… They think he's weird. He's not gonna… This is the way I went through school I didn't want to be around other kids… Because, I felt awkward. But when I was with adults Especially somebody who liked the stuff I liked It was good. That's why I like Grant to be in here… 'Cause I can kinda see where he's coming from. Who he is. Right, but he's my brother, not your son. He needs to get outside. I understand that, but you have to let him be who he is. I'll deal with him how I want to, He's my brother. I'm sorry… He is my student. And I will protect him if I need to… Even if it's against his brother. So… Behave accordingly. I'm on some deep shit. I'm on some deep shit. What are you sayin'?! …I'm in a coupe and alive… Stop. No. Stop! Go stream 'Yummy' What are you gonna do this weekend? I'm gonna go out With my friends; smoke some big blunts... We're gonna chill like this. We gonna sit on some chairs. We gonna smoke some blunts. We gonna be all nice with it. - Okay. - Same old same old. - Are you gonna have any girls there? - Uhhh… we'll see. I don't know if my friends can do anything with that. Why? - Cause they also fail like I do. - Ohh… You fail Josh? - I feel like you don't! - …”doin' too much” What are you talking' about? - Jews in the Hood… - What?! You know “Jews in the hood” by Drake and Future but But it was changed to “life is good.” They originally named That song 'Jews in the Hood” But, back to the women. - So it's not happening with that? - I don't know about the girls… - We'll see what's happening. - All right. Peace Josh. It's the time. It's the time. - It's when it happens. - Alright Dance off-away in the distance. I appreciate this little school we go to, but it's like… You can't really walk around here consistently happy, can you? Nah. There's no women that look like this here. Well, I mean, that's a different thing. But it's like... There's not a lot of diversity with the girls. All the same. All got the same shit going on you know They are. It's very cookie cutter. Who's that one girl… Ashley? - Yeah - Got ass shots, in high school. - They just want the lifestyle. - Wild, wild… Cause they wanna look like The girls on Instagram. Talk about first world problems Like, it's cool if you don't look like them. You can look like you. It's just... I don't want you. I'm not gonna lie, your Mom's a fucking bitch dude. - Yeah bro - She ended this party… Plan your own fucking party stop shitting on my mom bro for real. Bro we've been planning this shit since like last week and your bitch ass Mom wants to cancel it. Bro for real. And your mom's a bitch. Take a I! Cool-my moms a bitch. Whatever. Yeah. I live in a small ass apartment. You got this huge mansion! Exactly, that's what I fucking thought! Go back to your fucking dirt hole. Why don't you throw It at your fucking house, Vaugh? You know how black moms be. - If I fuckin' breathe wrong… - Fuckin excuses bro! I'm just saying, y'all wanna have a party so fucking badly… Y'all hatin' on me. I just don't get why I like your mom had to end the party You're acting like I don't want to throw the party anymore. I can't throw the party. What the fuck do you want me to do? How you doing? What are you reading? “Oh the Places You Will Go” Dr. Seuss. That's nice. That's nice. It's like the last book that I've read-by the way. So I was just wondering. If you had the homework The biology homework. You know? The reverse osmosis sheet? That's due next period. Yeah You have it? That's great. Is there any way I could borrow it by chance? I just need it. No one's giving me their homework and uh… I kind of need yours. I'd really like to use your homework If that's alright. - Use my homework? - To check it out. You know because I obviously have it due next period. And… - I need to turn it in. - Why didn't you do it? I was you know I was up late last night. Working and stuff like you know it's it's hard for me to keep up with the high school regimen and… I kinda need… I just… I rely on people like you for my homework. If we're being honest with each - other. - People like me? Yeah. Nice, caring, positive individuals that do their homework and complete it on time. I just feel like I always see you around. You seem like a nice cool person. You're clearly a hard worker because you've got your work done. Right? Yeah. So I mean if I could get the homework that would be great. Okay…but… - Just this time… - Yeah. Yeah…Just this time. And the next time… This. Thank you so much for this. I appreciate you so much. I needed the homework a lot. Yeah I just wanted to say the color of that blue matches very nicely with your… With your smile. Your smile… I think it... it has the power to illuminate a whole room full of people. Yeah. It's what I think… Anyway… Thank you. That was like a month and a half ago… He asked for that In the beginning. He was like 'I don't really know.' He's just, like, asked what my opinion is. He didn't really like 100% ask… Okay…But then he cheated on you! I know… He has to stop texting you. If he really cared - about you. - I don't want to though… You don't understand that; you're not gonna like understand because like you're not as intimate - as like… - I know… Liam and you don't like… Well, that's very different… Very different, you're not even dating. It's just, like, weird to me… And like… I don't know. I don't feel like I wanna 100%, like, let it go. I feel like he does not care as much about you as you care about him. He's walking on your feelings Him texting you every day is not helping the situation. You need to tell him that he needs to stop talking to you. Because you will never be able to get over this. But like, the difference is like I don't want to do that. That's the thing. Like I don't want to do that. Like I don't want to like not date him. - Yeah but he treated you terribly! - The difference is Like I don't care. That's the difference. Because I love him and like it's different to me because like I mean like he does love me and then before he told me like I'm the first person he's like ever loved and then like these other girls that he hooks up with her just like. But there are other girls! If he loved you that much - there wouldn't be other girls. - But that's not the thing. Like it's not now. It's just this one girl that like fucking had to fuck everything up which sucks because like… Who like does that? Like out of anyone… like who does that? Yes a girl fucked it up but it was his fault too! But, like… no. That's the difference Like… yeah It's probably his fault too. I understand that. But like… Who like agrees to hook up with someone else's boyfriend? Like, that's the difference. Yes, the girl's fucked up but… he had a girlfriend. He said he was in love with you. If he was truly truly in love with you he would not have done that. I mean this is like why I didn't even wanna tell you this because like you're like making me feel bad about myself and it's like fucking annoying like… if you were like a real friend like you would accept my decision and like not like try to have me be like alone and lonely and like fucking like depressed. I care about you and I just want whatever is best for you. - I feel… - Yeah but you obviously don't because like you I mean whatever's best for me is like my decision. That's the difference. It's not. You make your decisions. I'll step out. Yeah, do that. Leave me alone. Like, don't talk to me. So, you don't mind if I copy this exactly how it is, right? You did it yesterday. I'm talking like exactly how it is. So she knows that. I kind of… Well… Maybe don't write it in the exact same place on the paper… Maybe, like, erase that and put it there. So it looks like you didn't follow the exact map of where I… Yeah. Yeah. I should I should. You're right. So. What were you doing after school - when you couldn't do this? - Shit… I dunno… I was probably fucking around. What is “fucking around”? I don't really do homework at home… - If you know what I'm trying to say - Do you do it at school? I'm doing that right now, kinda… That's what I'm trying to say… Well, then what do you get on the quizzes when you don't - have other people… - That's the tough part! This is like… I have, like, a full-ass manuscript - like, right here. - From what? What class is that? This is from a history test. By the way I got a 96 on this history test How the fuck did you get a 96 on that test? People always run out of time. And get, like, a 20. You don't run out of space on your arm… So when you write it all down over here. See. She went up to me today. She was like “You did so amazing on that test.” - “You should be proud of yourself.” - Did you feel proud of yourself? I was like 'Thank you.' She's like 'No thank yourself.' - She was like thank yourself… - And did that feel shitty? No it doesn't feel shitty at all because, like… I get to 96 what does it matter like how I got there. - You know what I'm saying? - But like… Won't there come a time - when like… - I don't think so 'cause like… What does this matter in terms of like, life and shit? Well.. I just think that like by any means like if you get to the end result that you want then what does it matter how you got there? Well like are you gonna be another one of those kids or whatever that gets in trouble for like, Buying their way into school? Like what are you…? I mean, like, I don't think it necessarily has to do with money at all. - Did I buy my way into these answers? - Well… No I found a genuine-ass person such as yourself… Such as yourself! You're a genuine person-take it as a compliment. Come on. It's not… It's not that deep. You think I'm nice and you probably want to help me out on this stuff. That's what I assume… I dunno… I feel like I constantly go through this thing where it's like I want to help everyone but then it feels kinda like shitty after 'cause it's like… - Did other people just not do the work? - Yeah! Then why don't you do it? 'Cause like… Who wants to do it when they can get it at some other time. But there's gonna come a point in your life, when you're going… You're gonna go to college, right? - Yeah - You're gonna go. Find someone else that has homework done. Honestly… Yeah, I mean… I'm out here, you know… Forming relationships and working on my social life and stuff. And, umm… You're sitting at home, doing work. I don't see how the two don't balance Each other out. I mean, I thought you were just giving me your homework to be nice and shit, but… Hell, I'm done… I don't really even need this… You can have it back. I wanna know… What this means… - Hold on… - Please don't read the text Jaya. Really it's not that important. He said 'lol' instead of 'haha' - Shut the fuck up! - I'm serious! And there are four 'y's' in 'sorry'… How does that matter? - He's in love with you! - He declined my phone call! - Who cares? - If he really liked you, He would have time to talk with you. - Even if you're really boring! - I know… Can you talk about your woman? My woman! Even if I like someone doesn't mean I'm always gonna have time to do whatever. Like she invited me- Don't make that face... Even if someone invites me to their house I'd have to say “No - I can't I'm busy.” - You can't say 'no I can't I'm busy' That sounds like you don't wanna go! - That sounds like you're an asshole! - You gotta be like… "…I really wish I could!" I said that I would go to her house… And then later she said Give us all the information! - Give us every single item... - Like what did you say?! Did you say “No I can't.” I said I said I. Oh I said something like that. - I said “I can't I'm busy.” - What did she say? What did she say? She was like “really” question mark. I was like “Yeah, I'm with my friends…” Oh! She's mad! I was like “Yeah, I'm with my friends…” Oh my God! He said: “Yeah I'm with my friends” - You're screwed bro You're so fucked… What movie were you seeing? We were seeing that… What's the new one with the two cops? Oh, you were going to watch a cop movie?! Bad Boys for Life! - Of course you were… - I don't even know what that is! “Bad Boys!” “Bad Boys!” - It was so good. - Of course it was… What's better? That or going to a girl's house? - I'm not gonna cancel plans. - He's not denying it! - I mean it'd probably be better… - Bad boys for life! - If I had both options before… - Is it like a fat donut eating cop? Shut up Clementine! Natalie, what are your problems? I don't have any problem because I've no one to have problems with. - Oh, that's so lucky! - No. No. What do you mean by that? Is it because there is no one that you like. Overall? Like you don't like anyone or because the person you like you can't talk to or don't have contact with? Yeah but it was in a friend zone kind of way… For you or for them? I got friend-zoned! I always get friend-zoned! Me too! - I've never friend-zoned someone else… - That's so sad! Jackson if you tell me you've never been - friend-zoned I want you to walk… - No, I've been friend-zoned once but- Once! Once! No it sucked. It was in fifth grade. Okay… It's definitely happened since then! You said you get friend-zoned all the time? That's so sad. I wish I was in the friend-zone all the time… Because like boys like some boys are just like assholes and they like to take advantage or at least try and they can never have an actual conversation with me and it sucks like it sucks. But like… we're chillin'. Like do you feel sexualized by every guy? - Yes! Yeah… - Do you feel sexualized by me? - Yes! - How?! I have done nothing but - be horrible to you! - And then you say… under your voice “I know you love me, Clementine…” Yeah, he's like trying to… Yeah, but I dunno…I feel like after a certain point of like only having people want to be my friend like having guys like just wanna… It's like “Oh cool…You know… I'm a female also…” - I wanna relationship also… - Yeah! I don't even want someone to see, like… I just want them to see, like, me… Ya know? I want them to like me not for just my body and my face but for my… like who I actually am. Like my personality like just who I am. I wish I could have a conversation… - With a blind person! - …with a paper bag over my head…That just says like “ugly” over it. And then you like talk to them and they're like: “Oh my God you're cool” and you take it off. And they're like: “Oh my God!” “You're not as ugly as I thought! I thought you were gonna be Shrek!” - I think she's pretty. - Bro…Come on… That's a bit rough, Jayden… - I mean… - She's a butter face bro. I mean… God. She's a dog! I mean, she's a nice person- You can't keep, like… - Talking about her like that. - I just call 'em like I see 'em, man. - She's like a 4… - Thats outta 10 Jayden! - That's generous! - That's worse than a failing… That's a forty percent. Well I don't think about it like that. I think of her as like. - A person who I'm like vibin' with… - Fuck all that shit! Do you really want people to see you with that? You know how that's gonna look on us too? You gotta… She's gonna bring the whole clout level of our group down! What you thinking about doing this weekend? Eh…What are you thinking about bro? East L.A., maybe? This weekend, I dunno… I am feeling East L.A.! I always suggest East Los- and we should definitely do that Because Spanish mami's… Bro, did you know that Shintaro Ito likes black bitches? Shintaro?! - Yes. - How? Because when he was in robotics the other day I was like pointing the laser pointer at Deyshane… And it was like going on her ass and stuff… - And… - I'm tired of all of this. The Grove? We go there every week. East Los? I'm tired of that Your house? Been there. It's over with. I'm done. Like…like… You still a virgin… You always rating girls and everything and it's just like I'm tired of it. I keep going back in this loop and… I don't give a fuck about what you niggas have to say I'm outta here. You gotta end this shit… This shit makes you look horrible. I know bro. I'm about to. Do you feel okay about this shit? No, I don't feel okay about this, bro! So why do you think this will just go away tomorrow? - Do you not get why I'm concerned? - Nothing has happened… That doesn't matter! Do you not remember the shit happened to me? Even though that wasn't true… But in other people's eyes it was true. I will speak to her! - This is done. - Then speak to her! - You gotta finish it! - I will! Bro, I will! I will, I will, I will… Swear something to me… I swear on everything I love bro, nothing happened… - You're not fucking her? - No! - Swear on your mom's life? - Yes bro! Yes! So, if you're fucking her your mom dies tomorrow! No shit G, no shit…yes! I'm not fucking hooking up with her. - …Moss Theater bathroom… - No way! - The Go-To! - No way! The Moss Theater bathroom… …That shit's nasty… That's the spot! That's the go-to! That's the school bathroom! Exactly! That shit is so kinky… That shit's so nasty… …that whole bathroom Is just a bunch of, like freshman, just pissing on the floor… It makes an aroma that exfoliates the situation! What was it like? It's funny, 'cause you see a girl like that; like easily Top 5 hottest girls in our grade… She'd be like nice and fresh and shit… But that shit stanky bro! She did not wash that… And there's residue! Resid-No! Don't tell me it's still on your fingers… Alright, watch this shit… - Hey, Grant! - …No, don't tell me… Hey Grant! Grant! Lemme show you something! Grant get over here! Come here! Lemme show you something… You wanna see something? Some real science? Smell this Grant…Smell that! You like that? You like that? You know what that is, Grant? That's human anatomy!

Wassup? You don't like that? You don't like pussy? You fuckin' gay Grant? Duh-Duh-Duh-Duh-Duh Duh-Duh-Duh… Talk, say something! 'Ay! Duh-duh-duh-duh I'll fuckin talk to you bitch! Who do you think you're talking to!? - Bro, I'm literally... - Who do you think you're talking to?! - Do you know who I am? - No… I'm his older fucking brother! Now I do not want you speaking to that kid like that! - I don't even... - No! Shut the fuck up when I'm talking to you! That kid is gonna be the head of NASA one day That kid's gonna be the fuckin' best scientist in the world And what are you gonna fuckin' be? You fuckin' peaked! He's just starting. Now get the fuck outta my face! Get the fuck outta my face! Hi… Hi… Ummm… I just spoke To Sebastian… Anything like you want to tell me or anything like that? I mean... about? About you like talking to a bunch of people. And telling a bunch people that we're like hooking up on a regular basis or dating or something. What are you doing? - I'm not... - No, you realize that like when you do all this stuff and when you tell a bunch people you're gonna get me in like a lot of fucking trouble. You understand that. Like you really have the power to stop everything that I've done for the past four years like graduate go to fucking jail. What are you doing? What are you doing? I mean, that wasn't... That wasn't my intention. You understand that no matter the intention you're gonna get me in a fuck ton of trouble. I'm gonna stop being graduated. I will have my college applications rescinded. I'm gonna go to fucking jail. If anyone finds out, you understand that? But that one time... Did it...? Forget it. One fucking time and never speak on that ever again. Keep my name out your mouth. D'you understand? One fucking time. Forget about it. You're acting like a fucking child. You're acting like a child you're like gossiping and kissing and telling. This is fucking insane. Stop. Stop being a little immature fucking child. Just think about what you're doing. It's kinda unbelievable. And I had a little crush on him... 'Cause he's cute… But he's like a little nerd… But he's like, really quiet. And so, I was like, you know what? It'll be fun! Because this one, I'll win. That's for sure, like… I'll definitely get this one because like who else was knocking at his door and… And then his friend comes up to me as the messenger. - Oh, this was like yesterday! - Yeah! And he goes: Yeah…I don't know… I would give up if I were you. He likes, like, really white girls, like European. What does that even mean?! That's some, like… Aryan-Hitler shit though… That's what I thought. But then, I guess, everyone has a type - And, like I have a type… - You talking about…? - Yeah… - …and I have a type. And like it makes sense I dunno why you trust him. It's just... it's just I thought it would be like a no brainer… I was like 'You know'… - it's like… - Why? 'Cause you're in like a different…? - No, because he's… - …social thing than him? No, that's what everyone was telling me. So they were all like 'Of course!' Why wouldn't he? And then I'm just not cute enough… - It's definitely not that! - You also just don't know one another… Just 'cause you're like “higher up” doesn't mean he's gonna be like “oh…” - “…Willa…” - It's like in 90210 Did you see that episode? Where Naomi likes the nerd then the nerd's like I'm sorry, I don't like you… I don't care that you're popular or pretty you're not my type. Oh my God! That's exactly what happened! But she's like way better than this like weird guy…! Yeah, and don't they end up falling in love? They do end up falling in love, and they get married! Sorry, spoiler! I would so get married… You'd so marry this guy you've never talked to! Who is it? - We'll tell you later… - It doesn't… …really matter. Isn't there something kinda fun about like… …when you pick a random guy… Ava... I need to tell you this. All right. I know you're fucking with someone who knows all this shit. I know that you have this guy. I know that I'm fucking me. Please just listen me. Since like sixth grade-fucking since the moment you walked into my class, there's just been something there's been a fucking connection. You've laughed at my jokes you've made you know. We've had a friendship but it's so much more than that. I. I just I feel something towards you like I've never felt towards any one. I know you're with this older guy and it's all about what is happening. I just don't know. I know that you're like this fucking. Gorgeous girl at the fucking top of the list but I'm just a fucking kid with a limp. I have fucking love for you. I love you. He just dumped me. He just fucking dumped me. Push me to the other side of the room. God. Why did you do that!? I was just wondering if you had… the biology homework…
