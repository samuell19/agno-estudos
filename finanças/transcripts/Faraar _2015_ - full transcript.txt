Friendship, rivalry and love give birth to many tales. But revenge puts an end to all these tales. Haji, on the beat I ride my Bugatti at the speed of 150 They try very hard Everyone talks about me I live in a foreign country I have my pride I didn't change my cap I didn't change my Nike But since I came I've changed the trend of music They try very hard but this is my time I still dine at a five star hotel With Gippy Grewal My lifestyle is like a movie I'm like a movie star There is no gap in my rap Which is my best attack You too should rap like me I don't talk big I don't show off I don't give a darn The friends are out in style The friends are out in style The friends are out in style The friends are out in style I ride my Bugatti at the speed of 150 The friends are out in style The friends are out in style The friends are out in style I ride my Bugatti at the speed of 150 A black car matching with my black attire I wear it because I like it Chandigarh and Mohali are my towns I take my sports car And can never be caught I don't call anyone's culture fake But Drake is no match for Gurdas Maan I don't talk big Ekam. Just like other Punjabi boys, he too, dreamed of going abroad. Whether legally or illegally, his dream was fulfilled, and he chose the right path that suited his personality. For the purpose of studies. Lord, bless me with a peaceful journey. -Where are you? -At the fields. Hello. Who are you saying hello to? That was my aunt. She has come to the fields to pluck some spinach. -Listen... -I'll call you later. Let me turn this off. Wow! It is so difficult to get the visa to America. One should ask a person like me about it. It is as difficult as finding God. Mother had said not to do anything wrong. Also, I have got a window seat. How fortunate I am! It's okay. If I feel hot, I'll open the window. I will not let you be anyone else's I will not let you belong to a stranger I will not let you be anyone else's I will not let you belong to a stranger I will fight against the Almighty for you And will have you in my life I will fight against the Almighty for you A breeze is blowing on the plane too. But her seat cannot be 13B. I am not so fortunate. Please come. Come. When one gets an American visa, consider God has started to answer your prayers. Did you say something? I was saying that, are you going to America too? We are all going to America. Really? So, is no one getting off on the way? What is it? Did you want to get off on the way? No, no. I have a ticket till America. Actually, I brought food from home. So, I thought if we stopped somewhere, I would have it heated up. Are you going to America for the first time? Yes, yes. I'm Ekamkar Singh Grewal. I'm totally prepared for the questions at immigration. Can I tell you a secret? I will also drive trucks there. Cooking is only for the cover story. I have everything planned. I was a little weak in English. But now, I have learned it. I live in America. I came to Chandigarh for a cousin's wedding. You must have gotten a lot of respect during the wedding? We respect people who live abroad. Anyway, people who live in America are respected a lot. Where in America do you live? Why? Do you need help? No, no need for help. I will send some cards on festivals. And when we get close, I will have you get some sweets from the village. Same to you. Are you sleepy? I will not lose you I will never separate from you I will not lose you I will never separate from you Even if you hurt me, I promise I will accept it with a smile -I must go. -Yes. There is the queue for new immigrants. Same to you. Yes. -What is this? -What's the matter? Don't you want to send me cards during festivals? I want to send them. I live close to your university. Really? -Wow! -Okay. Very soft. -Ekam. -Yes. Mother, your son has reached America. Whenever there is a Punjabi criminal case, they call for this officer. Sergeant Jasjeet Singh Sandhu. Sir, my name is Ekamkar Singh. I don't even know Shinda. I have been telling this to everyone since morning. I'm tired of telling this. Whether you're Shinda or Ekam is something you know better. But we won't let you leave till we confirm it. But who is Shinda anyway? Shinda was a hardcore criminal in Los Angeles. He has been accused of the murder of two policemen and three civilians. That's shocking! He looks exactly like me. Last year, the police held an operation on November 8th during which Shinda died in a bomb blast. Sir, if Shinda is dead, why are you after me? I'm here for studies. God knows how my mother managed to send me here! The police just assume that Shinda died in that blast. When his body was found by the police, it was so badly burnt that it couldn't be identified. We didn't even have his blood type because he was living here illegally. We believe that the corpse was that of Shinda. And now, his lookalike is sitting in front of us. Seeing you, we feel that Shinda did not die that day, but escaped. You are permitted to make a phone call. you can be granted a lawyer by the government. What's the matter? Don't you want to send me cards during festivals? I want to make a call. And it's unfortunate that you are trapped here. Look, I'm not a lawyer and I don't even know one. Don't think that I don't want to help you. I will do whatever I can to help. Yes. There is a lawyer in Los Angeles. Karanvir Jatana. I've heard that he even goes out of his way to help Punjabis. Something or the other about him is always in the news. First, I will investigate this case at my level. I need all the details of Ekam's passport, his residential address and if he has any relatives in America. Then I need their addresses as well and the details about all the family members back home. Sir, whatever you explained to me over the phone, I have already brought all those details. Sir, he just has a mother in his family and no one else. Look, dear. Before taking up your case, I want to ask you a few questions for my satisfaction. If you need my help, then tell me the entire truth. Yes. If you hide anything or if I find out that you have lied a bit, then you'll have to rot behind bars all your life. Absolutely. I cannot thank you enough that you have come to meet me. Do you have any relatives in America? No. All my relatives are in Moga and Mansa. No one has seen anything outside that. I have an uncle who works at a bank. He sometimes visits Chandigarh to take part in some agitation. Where do you live? Your parents' names? I am the son of the late Mr. Laxman Singh and my mother's name is Mrs. Mahendar Kaur. First and second grade was in the village school. Then till the 12th grade, DAV College Samrala. Who else is there in your family? Just me and my mother. Now, mother is alone because I am here. Okay. I'll begin the investigation from my end. And you... Just sign these papers. Take it. -These... -Sign these. These are not your property papers. We had two acres. We had to mortgage that to come here. Mr. Sandhu, this boy is absolutely right. He is not Shinda. He is Ekamkar Singh Grewal. Mr. Jatana, I didn't get you. Yes, Mr. Sandhu. Look at this video carefully. Shinda shot with his right hand and he shot both the men in their head at a distance of almost seven meters. It means that Shinda was right-handed. And a left-handed person can never be be so accurate with his right hand and that too, at a distance of almost seven meters. This boy is a lefty. He signed these papers right in front of me with his left hand. -Mahendar Kaur? -Yes. Just a moment. Hello, Aunt. Hello, Aunt. Hello, who are you? -I'm Karanvir Jatana from America. -Jatana? Ekam's teacher. Hello, dear. May God bless you. Is everything fine? Did Ekam reach there safely? He didn't even call up. I'm really worried. Yes. He's absolutely fine. Don't worry about him. He's a very good boy. Yes, that is true. Aunt, I have a few questions for you. It's a part of the formalities in our college. Sure. Tell me, dear. Is everything all right? Yes, he's fine. His class begins tomorrow. Dear, if he does not do his homework, then scold him. A teacher is like one's parents. Yes, you can stop worrying about him. He is my only son. I have raised him with great difficulties. Now, dear, he is in your hands. Dear, if he is nearby, can I talk to him? No problem, Aunt. Now, he's in his room. He will call you as soon as he gets his mobile. Okay. Don't worry, I'm here. Okay, dear. Bless you. -Okay. -Bye. Bye. So that we can save an innocent boy. Okay. Absolutely, sir. Sir, we have found out that Shinda's aunt lives on Blue Water Street. I have heard that Shinda would stay there. -Devinder Kaur? -Yes. Shinda was my elder sister's son. He came to America through Mexico, in an illegal manner. He stayed in Sacramento for two, three years. But he couldn't stay there permanently. Then he came here. He and Sunny used to go to work together. What work did he do? You know what other Punjabi boys do here. Shinda played kabaddi in India. He used to go out many times at night. He would tell me, Aunt, I'm going to do wrestling. And I would ask, wrestling? What wrestling goes on here? He would say, the one that foreigners do. And they have a good prize too. That day of November 7th was a dark night for us. Sunny and Shinda left, but didn't come back. How did you learn about Shinda? I read in the newspaper the next day. I was in a shock after what I read. Sunny is still missing. Was Shinda permanent here? No. But he was very happy. He had a friend named Nicky. She was a Punjabi but she was born and brought up here. They both were very happy. He would say that he would marry her and become a permanent citizen. Even I was extremely happy. Mothers always pray for the well-being of their sons. But God had planned something else for him. I wonder who cast an evil eye on our happiness. I just have their photos now. Aunt, can we see their rooms? It's possible that we might find a clue. Yes, sure. Since Brother Shinda came in my life, I felt complete. Laughing, enjoying, dancing, playing, a lot of fun... Every day is filled with joy and is colorful. Sir, I have found this diary. I guess it belongs to Sunny. November 3rd, today is Brother Shinda's eighth fight. Nowadays, Brother Shinda is at the peak in street fights. And so am I because of Brother Shinda. They say the opponent in today's fight is very strong. Haji, on the beat I ride my Bugatti at the speed of 150 They try very hard Everyone talks about me I put 500 on Michael. This is Sunny. Innocent... He thinks from his heart, not his mind. That's why Shinda's life... Brother, are you going to bet today? -Five hundred on Shinda. -You have made a great choice. Kaptaan. God knows why he is called by that name. But he is definitely the captain of street fighting. He hunts for the best fighters from the small fights and it's his job to take them to the next level. Three, four, five. It's 500, buddy. Yeah. Nowadays, the kids act smart We say these things are old Nowadays, the kids act smart We say these things are old They will burn the surroundings They will lift weapons If anyone beats them The one who saw his day rise From the rooftop in the village The one who saw his day rise From the rooftop in the village I have been through many such tough days The one who saw his day rise From the rooftop in the village I have been through many such tough days To say all this is very easy The work we do is difficult You don't get these opportunities So easily These liars deceived us He left the house saying He wanted to be a star Now, God is looking after me Whatever I have written is the truth Those who were standing with us Like pillars in difficult times Those who were standing with us Like pillars in difficult times They are family to us After winning, he will be proud Get up, Brother Shinda! Get up! The one who saw his day rise From the rooftop in the village I have been through many such tough days The one who saw his day rise From the rooftop in the village I have been through many such tough days How will one who looks incompetent Harm me? How will one who looks incompetent Harm me? This is Shinda. Self-willed, happy and proud. He is one of the people. People say that Shinda makes decisions based on love from his heart and for battles, he uses his hands. You were amazing, Brother! Come, let me introduce you to Kaptaan. Come. Did you see his fight, sir? He shattered him in a punch. Kaptaan admires lions. Not the ones in the circus, but like him. Out in the open. You have something special in you. -Who is he? -He's my brother. My aunt's son. Shinda. He has come from Sacramento sometime back. And he is Kaptaan. He has a great reputation among the night lovers of Los Angeles. A diamond's value is only known when a jeweler sees it. Raise your level. A lion doesn't have any difficulty in killing a deer, eagle or a snake. If I come down to show my talent, you will forget all your levels. I do as I please. I fight where I wish to. Twenty-three, 24, 24 and a half and 25,000. A prize of 25,000 from the English wrestling. Today, we will drink liquor together and enjoy. -You should join us, sir. -No, no. Enjoy the function. I must leave. But do come if you are ready to take up something big. I will wait. Come on, Sunny. I don't go back on my word They respect me for it I don't go back on my word They respect me for it Keep your hopes high I will make them bite the dust The one who saw his day rise From the rooftop in the village The one who saw his day rise From the rooftop in the village I have been through many such tough days The one who saw his day rise From the rooftop in the village I have been through many such tough days After drinking, the Jatt Is roaming around the streets -Hey, Sunny Singh. -Yes. They rightly say, this liquor gets the best out of you. You must see beautiful dreams after drinking. Really? Tell me, which beautiful dream did you see? Me? I am riding a tractor in the fields. Nicky is sitting beside me on the tractor... There is smoke coming out of the silencer and the tractor is making a weird noise. Brother, what kind of a dream is this? Listen, idiot. As we ride the tractor, birds follow us. And Nicky's hair and veil is flying with the breeze. Only you and Nicky are in this dream. Where am I in the scene? Idiot, look. The one bringing the tea in a kettle... That's you. Really? Both of you will have tea together. That's all you dream of. Come on, listen. Don't say stupid things. Do you realize how late it is? You have to wake up early tomorrow. No... Tonight, I'll go to the casino. Hey, idiot, do you want to go to the casino? Whenever we go to the casino drunk they kick us out. Today is our lucky day, bro. A lion never misses its target and beating Sunny in gambling is not an easy task. Listen, listen everyone. The ants are suffering from the cold. Hey, for God's sake, don't go there to lose. Brother, you can hit me. How much did you lose? -That's what I'm unable to tell you. -Has the cat got your tongue? Tell me. One lakh dollars. How much? I'm ashamed of myself. Where did you pay the rest of the 80,000 from? I took 80,000 from Frank. Brother Shinda, I will never gamble again. You decided that very soon. Frank would kill people even for 500 dollars. How did he spare you? He has given me 48 hours. Brother Shinda... -Yes, tell me. -Help me this time. Nobody is going to lend us so much money. Call your friend Kaptaan. He was talking big last night. I told you that I'd wait. But I'm happy that you came today. But Sunny, you know what the best move in gambling is? What is it? Stay away from gambling. All of this is my hobby as well as my passion. My passion is business. No business is run by heart, but with your mind. My mind says not to pay you. You are under the debt of Frank now. After this, I'll chase you. Being a Punjabi, I will tell you that people like Frank are crazy. We are crazy too. If you're a businessman, talk like one. Keep quiet. We need the money in two days. Will you fight? When? In downtown, there is a secret fight organized every Sunday. Do or Die. To win, you will have to kill the opponent. And if you lose, you die. All the millionaires of California bet there. I will bet two lakh dollars on you. If you win, I will have the bigger pie and two lakh dollars will be yours. But if you lose, I will lose my money and you will lose everything. Pardon us, sir. We don't need to fight at such a place. My brother's life isn't that cheap. You arrange the fight. We'll meet on Sunday. Done. Come on, Sunny. Brother Shinda, if something happens to you, I won't stay alive either. Sunny, worry on the day when five to seven men surround me. When it's one-on-one, nobody can beat your brother. This job is very difficult. Yes. But we will not get much from an easy job. Anyway, we have three options. If I do not fight, only you will die. But if I fight and lose, we will both die. But if I fight and win, both of us will be saved. Life has been testing us at every turn. Why not another one? This phase of life was very weird. Brother Shinda was looking into the eyes of death for me. All the limits of bravery ended with Brother Shinda. Oh, no! Oh, Lord! Forgive me for this sin! Sunny, you were the one who gambled... but he lost the game. You were great. I knew that killing makes one feel amazing. I have a principle in life that nobody has a tear in their eyes because of me, but for me. You can never be a star with honesty, Shinda. You can never rule by being honest. You have to put fear in their minds. The way a tree does not eat its own fruits or rivers do not drink their own water, similarly, Shinda doesn't live for himself but for his loved ones. Wow! Now you have killed just one, Shinda. You still have to kill 25 more. Once you kill the 26th, you'll win Kaptaan's heart. If you doubt it, then try me. When your Kaptaan feels he is a burden on this land, call me. I will be there. Even if it's at the middle of the night. Come on, Sunny. He talks like a poisonous snake. I never found someone so intimidating in just two days. From the money Shinda won, he returned 80,000 dollars to Frank and pulled me out of the death trap. Our lives were going really well. Brother Shinda and I were very happy. Sunny, I must declare something clearly. What is it, Brother? Boys and girls in Delhi, Kolkata and Bangalore go on dates. Yes. But boys and girls from Bathinda, Mansa, Moga and Ludhiana go for trials and hearings. That's true. If I were not living here, I would not be going on American dates, but hearings. It's the same here. The only difference is that the dates there are during the day, and here they are at night. Idiot. If you and Nicky weren't in my life, I would be lost. I would be craving for love all my life. My father has seen me growing up from the heavens. He must be happy to see us happy. Yes, Brother. I'm sure the sound of our laughter must be reaching up there. And uncle must be shouting out... Look at my lion! He shattered him in a punch! Kaptaan. Sunny! -Yes, Brother. -Where are you? There is a blast here. I took a five-lakh-bet for Shinda. Five lakh. Whatever we win will be divided in halves. You know, 50-50. Ask Shinda to be prepared. The fight is the day after tomorrow. Brother, one minute. Brother Shinda, Kaptaan has called. He has bet half a million on you. He has asked you to be prepared for the fight. Tell him that I won't fight. Has he gone crazy? I have taken up the bet already! Get him on the phone! Sure. Brother Shinda. Kaptaan, your memory is a little weak. I had told you earlier too, but you forgot about it. I do as I please. I fight where I want to. Goodbye. Sir, should I say yes for the fight? Nicky's phone is switched off. -Where did you ask her to wait? -Right here. We'll wait here. Go inside and check. Yes. Careful. -So, Preeti... -What else? -He left. -So, what is it? -Give me a kiss quickly. -Why? No, no. The deal hasn't been canceled. It was someone else. Someone else. -Where is Nicky? -What? Where is Nicky? -Who are you talking about? -Don't act innocent. Tell me clearly. Someone kidnapped Nicky. The kidnappers are asking for five lakh dollars. If you think that I'm involved in this, then both of you are wrong. Yes, but to arrange the money, I can arrange a fight to help you. I will arrange the money. Just pray that you pay the ransom and get Nicky back or else, you know what they do. I do my business straight and you do it almost wrong. And remember, if anything happens to Nicky, forget about this night life that you enjoy. I won't let you be at peace during the day too. Do you think Kaptaan will be scared of your threats? You're at least scared, but you don't show it. Call him when you have to shoot birds. You need guts to kill a man. I will remind you once again. Shinda thinks about love from the heart and for battles, he uses his hands. After looking at you and your people, Kaptaan, it feels as if fireflies are threatening to cause fire. Whichever step you take, take it smartly. You cannot get insurance for the one who is dead. Remember this, Kaptaan. If you do something fishy, then you will be controlled by Shinda. And only one kite will fly in the sky, which will be Shinda's. An action done without consideration is called a mistake and the one done with a lot of planning is conspiracy that Kaptaan has done. The man is strong. There can be two swords in one case, one dull and one sharp. But here, both of them are sharp. One has to be taken out. What is in this, Brother? -Newspaper. -Newspaper? And the money? What do we do now? Drive. I have thought of something. Brother Shinda, Nicky isn't here. It doesn't feel right. Brother Shinda! -Have they escaped, Brother? -He didn't escape, someone helped him. Come on. Come on. I'll go there. You go there. All the best. Nicky? Where is Nicky? She is fine now. She is sleeping. Brother, this means the police are also with him. It looks like that. Kaptaan. Take it. Sunny... let me talk to Shinda. Tell me, Kaptaan. Before you destroy my night life, I thought I must let you know who kidnapped Nicky. Come tomorrow morning at 11:00. I will show you the man whom you are looking for. Kaptaan is behind all of this. What did he say? There is a bridge outside LA Northside. He asked me to go there at 11 a.m. tomorrow. I hope we don't get into trouble by going there. We are already in trouble. Let's go. We'll see what happens. This diary ends here. This is till the 6th. This means Shinda and Sunny went there on the 7th. But what happened after that? Only Kaptaan or that girl Nicky can tell us about it. Anyway, tomorrow, I'll ask for the next hearing at court from the judge. But now we have to find out about Kaptaan. Jasmine, go and meet Ekam. He must be worried. -And give him all this information. -Yes, sir. -Jasmine, I... -Ekam, don't worry. You will be proven innocent in the court. I make My beloved's picture and cry I make images On paper and cry I take some mud And go to war I draw A Romeo and Juliet And cry I draw A Romeo and Juliet And cry Shinda? Yes. Shinda. I thought you were dead. I was peacefully dead but you brought me to life again. This means what the police is saying is right. You didn't die that day, you escaped. Escaped. I escaped from LA. But you will have to escape from this world. Oh, Lord! Protect us. I hope this dream doesn't come true. An innocent life is at stake. Ekam! Wait there. I'll be there right away. This attack was on Shinda. This means Shinda's enemies are still on alert. And this clearly means that there's an officer in the police department who informed the attackers. In such circumstances, it won't be right to hand over Ekam to the police. Let me talk to the judge. Jasmine, take Ekam to a safe place. Come with me. Ekam, take a seat. I'll bring a bandage. Jasmine, if you are not around me, I feel uneasy. And when you are around me, I forget everything. I go into a different world. It's a completely different feeling altogether. My soul is where you are My soul is where you are The place where we made big promises My beloved runs like blood in my veins My beloved runs like blood in my veins Wherever you walk from There is your scent in the breeze If I don't see you for a moment My heart is sad My heart is sad Wherever you walk from There is your scent in the breeze If I don't see you for a moment My heart is sad When I see you I feel I have seen God My beloved runs like blood in my veins My beloved runs like blood in my veins When I drown in your memories I keep drowning I keep singing about you All day like a song When I drown in your memories I keep drowning I keep singing about you All day like a song I'll take you away from here I'll go along with you My beloved runs Like blood in my veins My beloved runs like blood in my veins Hello. All good? I am fine. I was saved. Ekam, you're an honest man. And even God is on an honest man's side. Even the judge has agreed to the police's inquiry. Jasjeet is doing the rest of the work. He will take you. But one thing is for sure that there is a traitor in the police department. Here too? Here too. Another good thing has happened. A close one's name has appeared in Sunny's diary and he has been found. Who? Preeti. It's Preeti. Who is Preeti? Sunny's girlfriend. She works at a restaurant. Meeting her will help us in our case and I'm going to meet her. -Sir. -Yes, tell me. Can I come along? As you wish. Even you, come along. Where has Jasmine gone? -She has gone to the market. -Okay. Shinda! Preeti. -Preeti? -Yes. -You are mistaken just like us. -Yes. He isn't Shinda. He's Ekam. Like the police department, even Preeti thought Ekam was Shinda. Lawyer Jatana told Preeti the difference between Shinda and Ekam. This has become the biggest trouble for me. Preeti, I want to ask you something about Shinda's friend Nicky. Nicky was a very close friend of mine, too. But after Sunny and Shinda left, we never met. My life is over after Sunny left. I have cut off from everyone. Just from home to the shop, shop to home. Do you have a picture of Nicky? Yes, I do. It's at my house. Come in. Would you like to have something? Please be seated. It may be in this. I'll have to check. Jasmine? You showed your true self. You're nothing like I thought you were. Tell me what your intention was. Ekam! Ekam, let me go. Let me go! You want to know my intentions? My intention was to protect you and help you. After Shinda left, I went to India. After my wounds healed, I came back and saw you in the plane. I knew that you'd be stopped at the airport. My only mistake is that I see Shinda in you. I feel Shinda around me. The day Shinda died, I was with him. Even Sunny died in front of me. That day, Kaptaan had called us outside LA below a bridge at 11 a.m. to tell us about the kidnappers. You are perfectly on time, Shinda. You seem to be very excited. Before fighting against the lion, one must learn the rules of the jungle. You must not act like a jackal. Tell me where they are. What will you do if I tell you? Whatever I did to his men. You have crossed the limit. You killed my five men and you still didn't die. You're a cheater. Cheater! Cheating is worse than killing. You shouldn't feel so bad, Shinda. And Sunny, you are just caught unnecessarily in the crossfire. I had sent them to kill Shinda. But then I learnt that Shinda's life is in Sunny. They said, "Kaptaan, take Shinda's life first." Sunny! Sunny! Nothing will happen to you, Sunny. I don't know how much time I have left. Nothing will happen, Sunny. Three... Took up a free fight Someone with pride has clashed with me Kaptaan is roaming around killing goats Kaptaan is roaming around... Nothing will happen to you, Sunny. And then Sunny died in our arms. Get up! Get up! The police were looking for Shinda everywhere and we both left the city and went to Apple Valley. We took a house for rent for some time there. On our way there, we stopped at a gas station. Shinda. We left the bread at the store. Freshen up. I'll get it. -One second. -Yes. Cover your face. I'll be back. -Yes, Nicky. -Shinda, the police has come outside. Someone must have informed them. Leave from there immediately. Nicky, I won't be able to escape so easily from here. Get to the Desert Mini Gas station. I'll meet you there. I'll be there. You may go. I'm telling you. Go. I'll be there. There was a massive blast when I was on my way. It seemed like the sky was set on fire. I was worried about Shinda. I wished he could come soon and we would leave to a faraway place. I waited for him from morning till evening. But he never came. During the winter at dawn, my beloved I would have fresh feelings about you Oh, my dear, the special present You gave me became my death During the winter at dawn, my beloved I would have fresh feelings about you Oh, my dear, the special present You gave me became my death I keep it close to... I keep your scarf close to my heart I keep your scarf close to my heart I keep your scarf close to my heart My heart keeps pounding thinking of you How do I tell you How my days go by in sorrow? My heart keeps pounding thinking of you How do I tell you How my days go by in sorrow? Oh, my dear, you left me in darkness... Oh, my dear, You left me in darkness to be afraid I keep your scarf close to my heart I keep your scarf close to my heart I keep your scarf close to my heart Shinda didn't come. He broke his promise. He was a liar. I wonder what I accused you of. You are right on your part. If you testify your truth at the court this Wednesday, then I will handle everything. No charges will be pressed against you. After that, Ekam will be released. I will state the truth In front of the judge I think the judgment tomorrow Will be based on your statement This will prove that I am innocent Your testimony on Wednesday Will release him Your testimony on Wednesday Will release him Your testimony on Wednesday Will release him Tomorrow I will hold your hand publicly And solve all the problems I will light firecrackers out of joy I find it amusing how this happened Your testimony on Wednesday Will release him Your testimony on Wednesday Will release him Your testimony on Wednesday Will release him On advocate Jatana's suggestion, Nicky gathered the courage and testified. Whatever had happened that day and how Shinda died in front of her... She narrated that entire incident. Even aunt testified that Ekam is really Ekam and not Shinda. That only Ekam's face resembles Shinda and not his personality. Sergeant Sandhu vouched on his experience of so many years and assured the court that he is Ekam and not Shinda. Advocate Jatana broke all limits of his recommendations. He did his best and was true to his reputation and left the verdict to the court. The court found Ekam innocent and released him. And welcomed him to America. Thank you, Mr. Jatana. I owe you my life. There's nothing you owe me. If I can't be of any help to my countrymen, then what's the use of my position? Thank you, Mr. Jasjeet. You helped me a lot. Why do you thank me? That was my duty. Okay, good luck. If you need anything, call me. Often when we think that a story is over, the story actually starts from there. Whether the enemies are in front of you or across the globe, revenge knows no boundaries. Brother Shinda, come. I'll teach you how to take a selfie. Teach her. What will I do after learning it? Just get here. When I'm not around, you'll look at my photos and miss me. What will I do with the pictures of an idiot like you? Come on. Stand behind. Smile. One, two, three. -At least pose. -How? Smile. Bigger smile. Bigger smile. There is no one like my brother. Forgive me. It took me so long, Brother. But don't think that I had forgotten about it. I will take this revenge, for sure. Hello. Kaptaan. Wow! Shinda, you have a great voice. As soon as you spoke, I knew it was you. I knew you would remember me. I could never forget you after Sunny's death. I think of you every moment. I tried to shoot you the other day. But Sunny got shot. You know why? Because you will die at my hands. Don't waste your energy over the phone, Kaptaan. Save it. It'll be useful in the fight. You must have heard the old saying that when a jackal has to die, he runs towards the city. Whether you die or I do, this last fight should be amazing. Tell me... where I need to be. Apple Valley. Sunday, at 11:00. I'll be there. Done. And listen, tell your family that you won't be coming back. Don't worry about that, Kaptaan. You must bring your family along. When you are dead, you need someone to be with you. -Hello. -Hello, who's this? This is Karanvir Jatana. Ekam's teacher. Ms. Usha is busy at the rehearsal. Please call back later. This isn't Mrs. Mahendar's number? No, no. This is Mrs. Usha's number. She's an actor. She's an amazing artist. Please call back later. Okay. -Where is Shinda? -He is waiting for you. Karanvir Jatana realized that Ekam is Shinda. There were many questions in his heart for which he wanted answers. If Shinda is in front of me then who was the man who died in the blast? That day, when we went to the gas station... Nicky, freshen up. Kaptaan? If Kaptaan knows I'm here, the police will surely know about it. Nicky, take the car out. Quickly. Quick. That contract killer was Mexican. I thought, just like me, the American government doesn't have his identity either. I put my bracelet on his hand and the American government thought it to be Shinda's corpse. After that, I went back to India through Mexico. What about being left-handed or right-handed? After going to India for about six months, I kept my right hand plastered. And did all my work with my left hand. I had all my tattoos removed as well. If you had gone back to India, then why did you come back just to die again? Mr. Jatana, everything isn't done just to protect your life. Some things are done to lead a better life. I don't get you. I loved Sunny more than my life. That day, when he was shot... Brother Shinda... Nothing will happen to you. Brother Shinda... Nicky and I took Sunny with us. But Los Angeles was quite far. Sunny's condition was getting worse. It was very difficult for us to get to LA. And a gas station was on the way where we stopped to get the bandage for him. We have arrived. Nicky, be quick. Brother Shinda. Shinda. His shot was perfect. Nothing will happen to you. -Here's your bandage. -Some more. Some more. No, Brother, I won't live anymore. -I don't regret dying. -No. Because I'm dying in Brother Shinda's arms. -I'm happy. -Don't say that. I'm telling you, everything will be fine. But I regret leaving a brother like you. You're not going anywhere. Now, you have to dance at my wedding. You have to play with my children. You have to fulfill my dream. About the fields. I was enjoying living life now. I don't want to die. And that Kaptaan shattered all our dreams. -Brother, promise me! -Tell me. Don't spare him. We will not spare him. -Both of us will go together to kill him. -No. You will kill him alone. You will take revenge for your younger brother. I will watch you taking revenge from heaven. Sunny. Sunny. Sunny. Sunny. Sunny. Sunny. Sunny. Sunny. We were not born of the same womb but we had that same blood running in our veins. Your last breath is accountable and I will kill that Kaptaan for you. I swear on you. I will kill him right here. Why did you choose me for this case instead of all the lawyers in the city? We went through your entire career. You have given more importance to justice than to advocacy. We couldn't find anyone better than you. It was our good luck that you didn't suspect us. We agree that our ways were wrong, but not our intentions. Life had brought us to a place where all the doors were closed. At first, even after winning the case, I felt like I lost. But now, I feel a greater victory. Cover everything See the blood my eyes are shedding Inform all the enemies My blood rushes To take revenge for everything My blood rushes to take revenge For everything My blood rushes to take revenge For everything The hands which were raised for killing I will break them His mouth did not tire calling me brother Only you can solve my problems My blood rushes to take revenge For everything My blood rushes to take revenge For everything My blood rushes to take revenge For everything Take these, dear. Hot flatbread made by your aunt. Give me, Aunt. Mom, now brother won't be eating your food anymore. What happened? Don't you like my food anymore? Aunt, he's just joking. Brother is in love. Now, make arrangements for his wedding. Really? But you didn't introduce me to the girl. No. Hold this, Aunt. I'll... You're talking nonsense, you dog! No! No, Brother. No! Enough! Ekam. Aunt. Aunt. Shinda. Get lost... You should have told mom that only her name is Nicky. She is a bomb. She has driven my brother crazy. No, buddy. She doesn't have anyone except me. Mother and father had left her and went away and you know the relatives very well... Nobody supports anyone. But she is very nice. Even you are not any less. We must have done some good deeds in our previous lives for us to have found each other. Brother Shinda, we weren't born of the same mother but I love you a lot. You're my life, Brother. When you're around, nobody can even touch me. If anyone does, I will take his life away. You are in such a rush to die! Kaptaan doesn't rush to die, but to kill. I will clear this delusion of yours today. Kaptaan is that lion who always roars. You don't become a lion by growing nails, Kaptaan. You have to hunt with bravery. Shinda has learned one thing in life. I don't start any fight, but I don't spare anyone who does that. You have a lot of grudges against me. I had told you before that Shinda lives life king-size. Whatever he does is the double, be it love or enmity. He who is used to winning can go to any extent to win. Many thieves, dacoits and politicians put together and when you join dogs and horses... Then Kaptaan is made. You have the strength. But you don't have the mind like Kaptaan does. If you need to control a crazy horse, you need to run by its side, Kaptaan. If you come in front of it, it will run over you. That's it. Enough of the trash talk. Remember, Sunny Singh. Be ready to go to your brother. Remember this, Kaptaan. Whether the sun rises from behind the mountains or rocks, the sun is always the sun. -We will kill him together. -No You will kill him alone. You will take revenge for your brother. I will watch you taking revenge from heaven. Neither Ekam, nor Shinda... Now, a brother will fight. Just naming yourself Kaptaan doesn't make you a captain. They say that when a dog goes mad, it must be killed. I told you that you do have the strength but not the mind that Kaptaan has. Run away, my friend... on a carriage You were right, Kaptaan. It's great fun to kill someone. I swear on you. I will kill him right here. Tell me, which beautiful dream did you see? Me? I am riding a tractor in the fields. Nicky is sitting beside me on the tractor. There is smoke coming out of the silencer and the tractor is making a weird noise. Brother, what kind of a dream is this? Listen, idiot. As we ride the tractor, birds follow us. And Nicky's hair and veil is flying with the breeze. Only you and Nicky are in this dream. Where am I in the scene? Idiot, look. Sunny, dear. Take some tea for your father. The one bringing the tea in a kettle... That's you. Really? Both of you will have tea together. Even in your dreams you have tea. Father is happy and has returned the loan I have collected some with me If I become happy I will tell you something The harvest is good, my beloved I will get you a diamond nose-ring The harvest is good, my beloved I will get you a diamond nose-ring I will get ready and go with you I will go to the market with you I will get ready and go with you I will go to the market with you I will get you a nice veil I will get you a satin dress The harvest is good, my beloved I will get you a diamond nose-ring The harvest is good, my beloved I will get you a diamond nose-ring The seeds that we still plough They are still waiting The seeds that we still plough They are still waiting Now is the time to enjoy We have lived miserly for long The harvest is good, my beloved
