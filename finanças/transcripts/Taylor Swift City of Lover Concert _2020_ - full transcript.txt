So, uh, like I said before, I, uh ‐‐ I had an album called "Lover" that just came out. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) And, honestly, it's been one of the most wonderful experiences of my entire life. Thank you so much for caring about this album, for listening to it, and for wanting to be here, uh, so that we could have ‐‐ In my mind, I look at this as, like, a party, like a release party, you know? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) And on this album, you know, I've always found love to be a really fascinating thing to write about. But with this album, I just decided to really just go into every aspect of love that I find fascinating right now. Like, with my songwriting, I've always wanted to take a moment, like, a snapshot of a feeling and explore that feeling. And, uh, one of the songs on the album that I love and feel like really sort of encapsulates the complexity of falling in love is the feeling of fear that goes along with finding something really good in your life, you know? (CROWD CHEERS) I think that, uh, if any of us have ever been let down before or we've ever felt like maybe we can't trust a good feeling, um, that's what I wrote this next song about. It's, uh ‐‐ It's called "The Archer."

I was thinking about how it would be ‐‐ how I'd really like to play some of these songs for the very first time, and I was thinking maybe ‐‐ maybe the best way to do it would be just playing the songs acoustic, the way that I wrote them. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) Is that alright? So, uh... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WOMAN: We love you! With this album, you know, everything on it is something that I wrote with one instrument, starting out. Like, either I would write it on guitar or I would write it on piano, and, um, so I figured, like, why not try out singing some songs for the very first time live here tonight at L'Olympia?
