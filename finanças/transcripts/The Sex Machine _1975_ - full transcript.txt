In the early 80s it occurred. the dreaded fatal energy catastrophe and the resulting technological collapse. We are on the threshold of 2000 and since about 20 years the earth has become a cold dark place. Life falls ever more and more into the nightmare of regression to the levels of medieval life. get out of the way We already had the gag on change horses. where are we? We're still in Rome. Well, yes, of course. Let's get going then. I'm sure I'm the only scientist on the right track. People have adapted, I know. Resignedly pulled out bicycles carts, stagecoaches, mules and horses. people live in the moon light. with candle heat and they cook by burning what little wood still manages to be plundered from the woods that remain. she does her laundry by hand like in the old days. carrier pigeons are also back in use but only the rich and the authorities can afford them. they have to send hand-me-downs around these inert machines. If even there is kind of a nostalgia to it. Those were called airplanes. and they used to soar through the sky like the birds you should've seen us as children traveling in them. Some continue to carefully preserve the shiny clean cars. Ready to drive again someday. I'm sorry, it's just for fun. we are on the verge of a collective neurosis. I'm told that many families have kept the habit of spending the evening in front of the television. They stand there staring at the black screen and they don't say a word for hours. I am convinced that finding a solution to the problem of energy sources has has become an urgent necessity All the universities are working night and day to this end. researching all the echoes of sound in caves, the vibrations of magnetism and light. they also tried to study the electrical discharges in the sky. A professor of thermodynamics has started studying the natural heat of animals. He believes that he can create electricity from high fevers my colleague De Renzi is researching the transformation of solar heat. If at least there was once a sunny day, everyone would remember my work. Keep at it, Renzi. You'll see, sooner or later. you'll make it About your experiments. Where is it? The only one who is on the right track, is me. I know it. it's such a simple idea. so simple, so elementary, the egg of Columbus. it's amazing that no one else has thought of it yet. to think that even a child remembers Galvani's experiments with frogs. That was two centuries ago. Not to mention Wilhelm's research on the bio-electric potential present in the skin of human beings in this field I have I've come a long way. Piera close the curtains trageda, lock the door Yes professor. The decisive moment is coming. We will finally know if the potential of the electricity in the skin can be measured and captured, used for a practical purpose. are we ready? Yes, Professor. Well before we begin, I would like to thank you. for your precious and faithful cooperation. It's an honor for us, Professor and also to remind you that if I asked you to step in as volunteer assistants for this experiment, it's only to protect the absolute secrecy of my research. Craig Johnson and Masters you're gonna be in charge of the experiment yes professor piera you undress, please. Yes, Professor. this might be cold, please excuse me. That's fine. Thank you. Besides, I'm engaged. it's fine if he finds out who's sure to hear about this, i'm sure. She'll end up in all the encyclopedias, but also Sorry professor. this is your task you simply have to stimulate her areas Yes. Professor that will tell the devices whether the energy produced here can justify the practical exploitation of areas as is written. certain areas of the body have a electrical behavior different from that of the rest of the surface they are lips ,nipples and earlobes. In this case when these zones are excited the electrical potential increases considerably. So there you go. Piera? are you ready? Yes, Professor. Contact established. Action. There is energy. the energy is flowing Taxi! Taxi! But now, I need more direct evidence. concrete, sensitive, luminous evidence. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Unobtainable. But look, I only need one. Just one in the living room. Excuse me Listen, I need some of those non-utility bulbs. Now these are lightning fast. What are you doing here? It's none of your business. I want them working with healthy filaments. Then let's go antiquing. Well, I don't have just one. i have 4. Look Philips even has the authentic date "1974". Of course it's all about price here. You're a collector. generous and open too. Even Rai says the most important characteristic of urban power is the urge to penetrate. It goes without saying that penetration implies the presence of two elements. Element Two penetrating one. This time I have to work on a couple. Darling maybe it would be better if you used a spoon. the real energy flows from the most complete sexual act. Of course, darling. It's been a long time since you've said anything so gentle to me. and the most complete sexual act on this planet, I have no doubt, is the friction between member and vagina. I have no doubt either, my love I'm going to go get ready they will turn on. They will then light up then it's not just a theory anymore. we'll have concrete proof that it is the case, that sexual acts, if of course the bulbs during the copula turn on, present an undistinct but relative current. Lie down. Here. If you don't take your hands off, I can't put The leash- enough, enough. Stop it. Status established. can you hurry up? have patience professor. I'm ready professor professor. A chandelier She still has it. i need the chandelier for the bulbs I have a Bohemian crystal made fire cost a fortune. I'll buy it and all the bulbs. 5. 5 kilowatts. Five kilowatts. One word at a time. doctor, you're out of order. No offense. out of four bulbs, one is lit You understand that it would take you months to light a chandelier. I'm sorry, but I can't wait that long. I repeat, I need two subjects. exceptionally gifted, you understand. but professor, not with three people watching you. And I believe it should happen under normal circumstances with no electrical wires between them. Excuse me. I am fully aware of the the difficulties you've had to overcome which is exactly why I replaced the electrode wires. I directly applied them to the genitals with these magnetic plates. they're to be applied under the nets. these magnetic plates absorb all the electrical discharges produced and transmit them to us through these wires I'll explain upstairs where we're connected. This time the two subjects will not be Hindered or frightened neither by wires nor of wood. It is well certain that they won't even expect that they're lending themselves to an experiment read two well let's check if the implant works. Dr. Spina? I feel great professor and you can see the controls well? I have perfect control of the whole environment. Great. Piera? Yes professor, Yes? He's DT'd on the bed, Spina said. stimulate the earlobes and the scalp. It comes in current if the professor does it well, but it comes in very well. Adjust. That's enough. Excuse me, Professor. I don't understand. You're not making any effort. we treat these two as sexual specimens. How do we bring them together as if by accident? they're not just gonna come here i'm expecting a baby. this is a state hospital, not a home. Excuse me for saying so, but who's supplying us with them? we'll go through police files. There's everyone's file in there there's everything, just everything: name, measurements, political ideas, habits. bank accounts, gastronomic tastes and sexual proclivities. I was given permission to access it under the guise of a scientific investigation. we worked through two nights before we found the right two subjects. we are certain. Daniele Venturoni who is the hotel manager he's a so-and-so director but all the hotel companies compete for him. because it says in the file that where he works, the clientele turnout increases by 150%. the number of women by 200 percent. Not to mention that he finds time to satisfy even corporate requests. So the oil tanker, hairdresser, the masseuse, and all the maids at the plan all make up for each 10 60 lifetimes. I want him here now. Franscesca Renzi. Age 29. Your file calls you a prolific housewife. prolific housewife, but it seems to her that the one's dreams, we're talking about pressing sexual needs. A nymphomaniac. not a great card to pull in life but it's perfect for the experiment. we will explain. it couldn't wait we had to bring them together by chance. otherwise it wouldn't work out. Good Morning,Good Morning overcoming some petty prejudices that will always exist, highlights the historical significance of the experiment. I'm sorry, it's all so strange. it is true that you were run over on the same day by an ambulance... The same ambulance please understand it's what they call a unique case. you'll have to stay for 15 days. i will, unless there are complications. I'm sorry, but I can't just turn away. it's instinctive, don't you think? No problem. Of course, since they took away our health they could have at least put us in two separate rooms. No, the clinic is as full as an egg. In fact, we were lucky to find two free beds i think i believe. believe me i'd ask. But believe me, I don't know what to do about it. I'd change it, but I can't. I see you're breaking and entering. I'd do it. I would if I wasn't as banned as you. An idiot takes advantage because the smart man doesn't. what does it say. Excuse me, ma'am. I'm sorry. Maybe it's better to sleep, don't you think? That you got right. good thing he has an erection so he can't sleep and hurt the results. No, it's okay. That means that soon the chandelier will turn on. Two weeks is a long time, I'm sorry. There's no hurry to heal. That's what's important. your children are here. I'll let them in if it's okay with the man over here. of course, for god's sake. I really like children. very kind. I love them. Kids kids come in. Come and say hello to the mob. there is a new Pope Mom but you didn't even say hello to Mom. is it true that your arm is broken? You don't look like it mom. You're not retiring, right? What are you talking about? in this economy? Ha ha ha, my leg. I'm sorry. I thought it was was from eating the panel. this Leg is not your mother's this is the property Of Mr.Venturoli i'm sorry for yur leg. we've gotta go now. Say goodbye to your mom. Be good at home. Say goodbye to the man. sorry. you're going to break my balls aswell. papa will stay here, meet him at the carriage. I remembered to bring your flute if you want to play it once in a while. Thank you for thinking of that. alright, let's go My love, get well soon. the house is so empty without you. so empty i can hardly believe it. Come on, come on, come on. when your finances prosper see where you are. Mr. Renzi, can i have a word with you for a minute you came to the stage of an unfortunate accident. you're lucky she is alive. My wife was a victim of an accident. your wife? Of course, his name is Renzi. But I thought everyone from the Renzi family is super hot. damn right your wife was due. There you go. An ambulance from the hospital hit her! Of course it's unfortunate. I don't want to say absurd and I don't know what to do for you. If I could at least get a single room in the hospital. can't take the risk It's very difficult. Every day a plan Tu Catania. tomorrow the deputy director is coming to the hotel. permission is given to all Together we can take the lady Dane asked us about her i'm sure francesca is fine Thank you girls for coming. But the others had better not come now. Get back to work on the third floor. thank you and goodbye they told me that the directors of the Berg are kind of like the great John. But you amaze me we all have to take the test, aptitude falls under very humorous duties. how so? I was told that sometimes housewives are very prolific and yet even you, Renzi, amaze me. It's part of the job description. You're a bachelor, aren't you? Yes, of course I am. you know, but what about you? i have children. Very funny. but I'm a graduate of the Cecilia school. and you're going to play it here. But if it bothers you, I'm not. not at all although I must say I'd prefer you to practice your other business. preferred the one of the prolific housewife. Now you're not even funny anymore. sorry. it doesn't matter. Mr. Venturoni, it's your wife. Hi, how are you? i feel like a cricket. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get that they don't talk to each other anymore as if they didn't know each other. Good morning. I don't understand. put it over here. And then. Saffron. But there. Paprika and candle powder it lasting till the 12th of may is good for you if that's the way it is, then it's fine. music. has always been a great help in the seduction business. This is Chopin, I'm told. he never missed a shot. Musically numb. I tried erotic readings Casanova de Saint Emmanuel The recipes of the Kamasutra. They laugh. What they're laughing at, I don't know. Instead, insert something that makes them friends and buddies. What I want from these two ingrates is not a cordial friendship but a simple naturalistic sexual one. They have to fuck. I know Dr. Spina. Does it seem dignified to you to wear a gown in that condition. I mean, no, I'll go change right now. Here. No, no, no, no. Go over there and see what those two traitors are up to. This coffee tastes like nothing you don't mind if i play the- but for heaven's sake, please. Thank you. Professor. Weird... Really! I feel like a genital tingle. What music is this? Mozart. Francesca, I need to talk to you. Bear with me. I don't want you to think the worst of me. Please don't worry. thank you. Excuse me. I wish i had told you about this earlier. Francesca, I feel a great desire to make love. I wondered when you'd ask me don't worry about it, it's the flute the flute? Yes it does the exact same thing to my husband. Even he has B-flat on the sharp B-flat. I don't know. If you don't look now you'll see what you did to me. Let's hope so, but I thought it would only have an effect on my husband, but look. I can't see a damn thing. I'm sorry, but right now could do you a favor. I would just like to lie down next to you, you know? And then. And then? And then touch you here and there. And then and then and then the cross on both breasts. Then if you precede, you'll make me think. I'll say it again maybe I'll stay here a little while on the breasts and you meanwhile think out loud if you want to speak or especially if you sing. i have a husband and eight children. are you quite sure that you have a husband and eight children. Not everyone wants that. someone who has been faithful to a husband. Because. Because it would have been beautiful. if we were together love with you would have been beautiful. Periscope. Here we go. look professor congratulations. I recognise professor, They're generating power at %25. Now it's no longer enough to simply turn on a chandelier I want to light up an entire building a street a neighborhood. If I can accumulate the energy produced from a sufficient number of assaults. And by linking the test subjects to this organic box we should be able to accumulate enough energy to reach this goal. I don't know, but I have calculated that it should be sufficient to get them to do it 10 times. And it's like when you do conservation and you put all your effort into one box and then when they're needed you pull them out all at once. in that box there? In this box here. is the most beautiful canning box that I've ever heard of you'll be able to light up the whole boulevard. Other than in oil or a high-powered power plant here, tension actually helps my love, are you ready yet? Yes, nearly. Damn it, Renzi. who could've seen this coming he can't take her with him yet. We must stop him. Professor how will you stop him. The period of hospitalization is over. Piera! Professor you have to push not pull. like I don't know. I've been working here for years. But love, aren't you forgetting your flute mom forgets everything Well, good bye. Have a good recovery. See you again, and thanks for everything. I'll pick you up here with the carriage the 16 children will be sitting on Mr. Renzi I have to tell you something. how am I gonna convince Renzi to please let me keep his wife for one more day and that I have to mate her a dozen times with Mr.Venturoni. Venturoni. of course for a highly noble and scientific purpose I must thank you. no I must thank you. Very, very much, very much to say, madam. she says she's been well looked after, she's been provided for for free and I believe you deserve the credit. So thank you very, very, very much cuckolded and happy. i'll be certain, after one or two more days, of her health. So as a precaution- but for goodness' sake. healed, perfectly articulate her arm, her hand. thank you for everything you have done. Come on, dear. Congratulations, ma'am, on everything. I lost out on 20 kids, I'm screwed. Piera Yes, Professor. you are a very pretty girl. Yes, Professor. You know how important this is experiment is. and if the subjects and streetlights are already connected, you know... Just in case he liked some other girl too. Yes, professor, please. Piera, I'm sorry to ask you this, but I really... I really shouldn't be asking. you know how much I care. and how much we all do. We all care about this proud creature Piera I would like to ask you to couple ten times with Mr Venturoni. And I'm ashamed of it. But how do I ask Piera. I swear I'll never ask you for anything like that ever again. Help me. Please believe me. Professor. She's already gone. Yeah. what are you doing? What is happening, tell me what you are doing. excuse my impetuousness I don't want to lose the pajama, I didn't sign up for this. I don't agree with what i'm doing aswell. I just want to talk to you. But as we speak i want you to caresses me. I like my breasts caressed, I'll be happy. Look, lady, I know I'm not doing this. you have misjudged me today. I just can't do it is it because you don't think I'm pretty enough? No, you're very pretty. but I really haven't eaten. So let's make love a few times You're not being nice. a few times? exactly! How many. let's see just enough so the experiment turns out great. maybe 10 I can make love 10 times. You're exaggerating. There it is. it seems like a quick little thing, not even a quarter kilowatt. Let's hope the other nine do better. We'll do them another time. I promise you, honestly. In fact, I'm taking a note now, so i won't forget it Nurse. Nurse wake up, wake up good look, I need you to do a little favor for me If you could just be quiet and give me the address... You understand? I live in Prati in via Monti but No i mean the address of the lady who was admitted with me. you need to get to a hospital! Taxi! Taxi! get over here! thank you thank you, please bring me to the previous clinic Seniora, wouldn't it be better to go to a Hospital that is closer. no i am too severly injured to go to a low end clinic Well, do as you please. we'll head to your previous clinic Good Morning Excuse me, is Mrs. Renzi here? She just came back from yesterday's clinic but just now they took her there again. she must have broken her foot at the clinic? These two didn't go so well. they sustained various rib fractures and severe dislocations of the lower limbs. are they alive? yes but they're injured from top to bottom? Professor! Professor! The test subjects are back! Professor! What about these two? get them fixed up and sent home. There's no room for them here. What a coincidence. Well this meat mallet fell on my foot. I know what that's like... And you? I broke two phalanges in my middle finger and one in my ring finger. and a pinkie finger. Go figure. so you're the one whose metatarsal they're taking out.. None of it's true. between you and me, I just wanted to see you right away I did that on purpose, too. I had come to your house. I brought you wildflowers. but the doorman told me you were back at the clinic so I took a brick and hit your hand with it? Well it was a for a good cause. I just wanted to see you again to tell you that we must never see each other again. You're right. I'm sorry, but it's impossible. Of course it was good of you to come back and to tell me you did the right thing. But maybe at this point it's best if we just keep going. yes. Establish contact with the accumulators immediately prefixed for. I like making love to you too much. That's why we have to do more. We can't to do it anymore. This is the last time we're doing this. or at least one of the last times and then we'll stop. Who does Beethoven think he is? But he's already up to 46 kilowatts, professor that's not enough. It takes 50, I need an orgasm. I'll explain, poor thing. Give him time, Professor. Maybe he'll get a little less tired. No, it's important! I want the tenth intercourse. Come on. three aspects. One more is strength or perhaps just the powerful rock just don't mention the name The tenth. One doesn't count for anything. Come on, come on. Professor. 51 kilowatts. see. Sometimes even a language that is not properly scientific has its effectiveness. Bravo. with 300 million in salary. What am I supposed to do on the 20th? you're asking for an advance? wow are you seeing these lights? I must be drunk it's not an hallucination, it's real. I'm curious about something. what about my sexual energy. what could i do? they're able to light up and entire neighborhood! I'll just try the old high-fidelity turntable to start with. she's always so beautiful. Let's see, you're not making love to her. You're wasting a lot of time. who is it. don't worry, dear. what are you doing there under the bed. I- I'm looking for my slippers I can barely see you beautiful. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do. I'll get me some glasses. and you feel good about yourself. you're pretty and beautiful you're beautiful but you're very beautiful You're great. As they say if a piece is ever a piece i like what you're talking about. finally you're not reading a book How do you wanna have it, honey? Now I'd like a practical one. I don't remember exactly which side you're on. Yeah, I know. But you said that we don't do it enough. then let's do it right. I'm interested, but no. Yes yes yes I'd like for it to play at least until the end of the first song. I wish. What is this music. it's like a record but it's so high fidelity it's not your average crank gramophone. Noble professor, please follow us. There has been an issue, you must follow us. Please You must speak, you must answer. I don't know if you realize the importance of this matter. you turned the lights on. Minister, I know of no such thing. who set fire to a burned-out candle. Professor Nobili you're responsible for this enlightenment exactly three hours ago, and right underneath you're lab. and you know nothing about this? that's right. Look, there are people who would do this the hard way. What does that have to do with the inquiry Powerful Asian, European, American Companies would kill for this technology. what are you doing? coffee You're not taking this seriously and you won't get out of here unless you do your part. Eminence. What is this story about the boulevard lighting up. monsignor, a miracle. So we're waiting for an explanation. All right. It was me I point this out as a non-polluting source of clean energy. professor, I object to the nonchalance of calling this clean energy. I'm a scientist Monsignor the theological aspect- you claim that we can get heating and television back, the means of transport and even the cars ready and drawing power. From a boost of sexual energy. yes, exactly I can show you if you want. I can have you witness, in person, the repetition of the experiment. But if it were true to think Italy for the first time in its history would be known as the number one power supplier. It would be known to all that in this field we are unbeatable. Nothing surprises me anymore. Science has always inflicted upon our heart painful blows, but this is certainly the hardest one to take in my position if he gets in our way ... there's gonna be trouble. you have to convince him they'll have to persuade him. But what exactly did he mean by eventual energy. Sexual energy, not eventual energy. Ah, I see. Monsignor Monsignor. you too have always preached love right in the heart. love in the heart, not- do not commit impure acts. It will be a matter of changing only one commandment. It wouldn't be complicated. it won't affect modesty? My authorities make decisions officially i have to attend to my duties. we'd appreciate if you could put in a good word, Your Eminence. think about it, seniore. you could be the new Luther, you could become a great reformer. I'll think about it and what do you think you're doing. please step through this door. You see, through the lens of this periscope you can witness the development of the experiment. Our two guinea pigs were asleep a minute ago deeply and tenderly embraced but it is to be hoped that when they awaken it will not take a long time for for the experiment to begin. Please, Minister. you should have the first look. Professor, there are three of them. What? The two guinea pigs are joined by a third. Venturoli's wife. Love, what a nice surprise love, a suprise to see you embracing this lady. what lady? oh this lady! yes, this one. You say I slept with her in my arms i'm sure of what I saw. Be quiet! They recommended absolute rest. That's good, but what were you doing hugging this lady. I don't know, maybe i did it in my sleep I don't understand why they put the beds so close together. Maybe it was her hugging me. I didn't even notice. I swear. So now you're all healed up come home and You can sleep with me in your bed. Don't worry. no one will hug you without your knowledge. Yes, yes, yes, yes, I was going to say that. i'm cured. I'll go get the carriages. I'll be waiting for you. i'll be down in a flash. oh you've awoken? I was awake the entire time. You're a coward. and rude too. if you come back and i'll stomp you on your little hands. you're being sarcastic. it's not a great time to talk, you know. I'm in a hurry. One more hand, one more foot free. Go to my house and when I come back we'll talk Everything is fine. I don't want to see or hear from you ever again. you can break all your bones if you want It's over! It's okay. With anyone else, I can't guarantee results. We put them in white and force them to fuck like a couple of soldiers we can discuss that in the future. At least for now, it is absolutely indispensable that the two subjects are completely unaware that they were taking part in an experiment we need to find a way to bring them together again. without any wives and husbands getting in the way. I have a sneaking suspicion that my wife is cheating on me and that makes me a little uncomfortable. Ah. Old prejudices. You're a man of science. let's pretend this is about Dinner. it's a physiological need for you to get nervous if your wife is going out to dinner sometime with someone else. Not me. Watch out. A couple of harmless fractures, but other than that they were fine. We had now secured the complicity of the the hotel owner and the director of the Concerto di Santa Cecilia the adherence of the former student to her craft may give us a chance. the concert will be a chance to lead her right in the arms of our genius plan. Go ahead now. Just like how the other plan was to have the hotel staff on vacation, would you watch out? i'm sorry. watch out next time. instead of waiters and waitresses we'll hire scientists and authorities to take control of the venue. Then we can carry out our experiment without arousing suspicion. Idiots, who taught you! Don't worry about it. Moron. professor. the government will pay for everything. I'm more concerened about Venturoni suspecting our plan No, no, no. He's just very upset about the service. you know how much i care about that. this is the room the event will occur in. i want plates everywhere! Under the armchairs, under the table, under the vase of flowers, everywhere! Even under the bed, in the bathroom, under the toilet seat. But I think they're gonna make love on the glass. I don't know where they'll do it. So put plates under all those. Even uncomfortable surfaces that might not propitiate and welcome an intercourse improvised both horizontal and vertical. Yes Professor! this time I won't take no for an asnwer. I don't want to attract any more prying eyes. I'll start the elevators. (mumbled math) Five orgasms should be enough to get all three elevators up to the ninth floor and get them back down to the first. it'll be a joy to hear Francesca Renzi's playing. It's too bad I don't have an excuse to see her again. Can you open this bottle? (With his granddaughter graduating from high school.) (she has to do two more years of advanced training.) (she studies with Professor Michael) (Professor Michael Johnson.) (he's a wonderful Professor) It's not coming out. There she is. Unfortunately, she hasn't seen him yet. She entered when Venturoni was in the back of the management but she will see him. And if I'm not mistaken, as soon as she sees him she'll lose her senses, and if she doesn't, I'll knock her out. I confess that maneuvering people's destinies as if they were Geneva puppets, is an incipient delusion of grandeur. here I am. I'm sorry i'll go and get a new bottle. It's a pain in the ass. this concert of old hens. You think that's a flute? Here we go. Francesca Francesca! Francesca! Out of the way! i am a doctor! it won't come out. You are the director because you should have the simple intuition to help out. You have a spare room? bring her to room 325! There are at least 20 other rooms closer to this one forget about that. no no, bring her to 325! Bravo. Good Job. and now you help me undress her me? undress her? yes I think there's a blanket somewhere. There's not much here. I'm sorry. What are you doing? Help me cover her up. you're doing it, and you're taking it well. I'm gonna go get something. It's gonna take me a while. It's all you. keep an eye out and make sure that no one disturbs you. Alright. professor. shush pay attention yes i think. It's the service. I can't do this. Maybe just three. and now you'll see it. Congratulations, Professor. You do realize that by destiny You can only meet so many times in life by pure chance. Now would you please allow me to do it. You need to rest. I'm telling you. i won't think about how beautiful you are. I swear I I'll never call you again. Such sensual touches. I'll do everything. let's wait now. So you need no scruples. we can sleep and noone can find us. Besides, we're alone here. it's all my fault. How can I say no. I think it's like last time. 3, 4 this is a beautiful dream. us making love. Okay we're there Calm down, gentlemen. I think three of you will be more than enough to control the experiment from the inside. Professor Gabrielli, you're the dean. You have the honor of elevator number one. I'm claustrophobic, but no one in the world would give up this opportunity Professor De Marchi, Mateiss contact established. Gentlemen. Go. Professor, allow me to express to you my great respect. just wait. i apologize for my doubts magnificent, extraordinary, fantastic job. we would've still been searching for copper without your greatness. he's stuck. Professor Gabrielli can you hear me. Try operating the emergency opening. There must be a ring. do you see it? I can't even jump in here try! can you reach it? It's too high up! that guy's gonna die i want to pay tribute to the first victim of the new scientific era general please. it's just a slight miscalculation. it shouldn't need more than 10 watts, maybe we can fix it. Professor Gabrielli? do you hear me? Just be patient for a few minutes. We'll set you free in the time it takes to make love. those two are fast. gentlemen, let's head downstairs. No no I won't ever forget what happened. you understand how risky this is for me. Even in a hotel room i'm not safe. I work here, but that's beside the point. I'm not some object. I have a husband and son who loves me. it happened once this isn't a movie. you've had 8 husbands in thirty years get away from me! Listen to me, Listen to me all i want is you i don't wanna hear it! You rascal we are in this place and are doing it. But it's not. Francesca I will never make love with anyone else ever again i don't want to be an adulterer. I'm a decent woman. I want a husband and children. please Francesca, please. Don't do this! I'm leaving. I'm leaving for good. Francesca, you're the woman i think of every day. Well, she's right. What now? who will pull Gabrielli out of the elevator. No, professor, I'm really sorry. I'm sorry. All right, I'll go then. it won't be a lot but it'll be enough. Come on, run. what are you doing here? You owe me, remember? But the real talent is talking. No, I don't like talking You've got nine more times to go with me. You promised, remember? i never promised anything! Yes, in the hospital, you must remember that. I said nine times! and we did it. so out of 10 times, means there's 9 times left. That's a good pounding. Well, that's enough. Gentleman naked while there is no one there. is he still alive? Hopefully rescued soon. we'll get him. Francesca it's not what it looks like. Francesca, please. Francesco, try to understand me. Let me explain. Francesca Please don't leave. you are all i want. I'm sorry. I happen to be acting on this obsession with fucking at the worst possible time. it always ruins everything. It's over. This time it's really over. He's on his way down. Professor Gabrielli. Please get the ladies out of here. Then, Monsignor, what news do you have to report. good or bad? I'll be here to observe and assess where you stand. The final experiment remains, Monsignor. We will operate on a much larger sample. no longer one couple but many pairs all at once. No more super-talented champions people unaware of their ability to engage excuse me, Monsignor. I want to know if even you and me could do it. I'm just saying, sir. if it produces energy. we should exploit it. solitary sexuality, homosexuality, mating against nature, libido, Oral coitus. Axillary coitus. Everything. we should use it. God, what a scandal! professor, it's useless to beg. more importantly. to know if to release electrical energy. the simple action of penetration is enough ,or whether the presence of the love, of feeling is required. And in this case we'd be screwed. The Lord could not be exploited industrially or even militarily. And me. I certainly hope not. That's the awful suspicion that's been bothering me. Rick was convinced that the presence of the feeling of tenderness was decisive and if he was right we must start all over again. how? i'm stupid. The other night I forgot to to disconnect my colleague and colleagues. But here it is happening in my bed. I wanted to yell. My own wife cheating on me with a guy. And why. Done. Thank you. But that's Ugo, the doorman. Thanks Thank you Ugo on the first day of the month? it may be no longer necessary. It seems the professor shows a certain reawakening of interest. That's right, Mrs. Martini is here. she booked a session. I didn't have a day off. you realize there are more than 30 of you in the building. i'm still available Let me know at your convenience. Thank you, sir. A mistress in our condo. Not even the dignity to know that we we have one another for our exclusive use. No, it's the same way that Professor De Marchi getting off Professor Torri is a disgrace. But it's less of a burden on the family budget Honey, Ugo has been very kind. We've agreed on a a very affordable flat rate. I'm not questioning that he gave a group discount you don't understand anything. It's a mechanical thing. body maintenance. believe me. I don't love him. It's stupid. But it's Ugo who starts the record player. record player? What are you talking about? are you sure, honey. about what? That you have no feeling for him. no feeling, however vague, of friendship. Of love and affection. I feel nothing. for him. How can I tell you? and the turntable went off anyway. THANK YOU. I'm going with much more security into this decisive experiment. I know now that love is not needed. above all let's not make a mess that's the rule of showing up. We've connected all the rooms to the hotel's electrical equipment fan, electric oven, coffee machines. Microwave, toaster, the blender. come you get in here everything was connected in here. here's what happens when the first one goes off in a bed. Energy discharges. The little number in the room below comes on. the number of kilowatts appears. you'll see if you have a vacuum cleaner or because my assistants will act as as spotters and relays. We will know as we go along, what happens in each room and I'll explain the value of energy. expressed by various sexual acts and behaviors. A great experiment! A great whorehouse! are we ready, professor. Gentlemen we can begin. Room 907, with the normal 5 kilowatts. anal sex, four kilowatts. teasing, 6 kilowatts. masturbation, 2 kilowatts. it's not much but everything helps. spontaneous, room 708 two kilowatts Twelve kilowatts. oral sex, six kilowatts. four legged, like beasts 7 kilowatts. come on let's go blessed son, are you sure you couldn't generate discharges from spiritual bonds between worthy maidens of sure virtue. I'm sorry, Monsignor, but I couldn't to get a pound out of platonic love and from chaste cohabitation it needs to be done. but monsignor, We could become the most powerful nation in the world. Armoured divisions aircraft and navy at the service of the Church the church can take a more benevolent attitude towards sex. We're not entirely unprepared for the rest as early as the eighteenth century the Belgian Jesuit fathers admitted to the palpation of the breasts. during sex. On this road we can certainly agree. Surely it will be enough to drive the spouses to all sorts of excesses. Encourage masturbation as part of of the family institution it's true but no that's not enough not enough? No, this isn't about lighting chandeliers. our problems here require enormous amounts of energy to reactivate large power plants factories. Depravity must be encouraged adultery, homosexuality, rape, not only encorouged. But we need hold them up as new models of moral life. for example discourage virginity. Perhaps with a tax. The triumph of lust. On the other hand, a gentleman is left with six other deadly sins. For example, we could agree and then call a council to replace lust with some new sin. It's not that easy. And what would you say to such a thing. what? Such as freedom of opinion or lese-majesty. It's never been heard of. We had done so well with sex without it. Excellence. Professor your experiment has been compromised the science equipment stolen. No that's not possible. These are the jerks from room 124. go tell him it's not the right time. what do you want? stay quiet Mr. Venturoli and you won't get hurt. We just need a little bit of information about the experiment. What experiment. The experiment. We want to see if you can run a train. A Train? That's right. you're crazy. So what are you telling us. I don't understand anything. Maybe you made a mistake. i spied on you, get it I still don't understand. Then you must now strip naked get going! What do you hope to find if I may know? Let me go. Don't touch me. calm down Normal penis, normal testicles. sorry if this hurts. stop pushing me this way Daniele Franscesca i can't believe this is happening. All of these people asked me about an experiment. I don't get it either. I've never experimented, neither have I. when you and me were stripped naked they said those things about an experiment and that I have to do something. they said the same thing to me but I'm glad to see you. I missed you very much. I always thought you felt that it's all over. that between us can never ever be anything again. What do you want. I didn't do anything. i can't give you a single penny but you can drive a train? O isn't she beautiful? in perfect condition. But that only means so much when it doesn't start. It's all over here then. you will be free and paid given you cooperate. But it's been 20 years since we've had power to drive. it can't drive without electricity. Do as I say. Well, the time has come. Now I will tell you what you must do. if you do do well I won't come back often within a blink of the eye we can become very bad guys obviously. But what do we have to do. this is crazy 5 hours. Within that time you must mate ten times. I don't understand. Who are you? that doesn't matter But why do we have to fuck 10 times? what do you want from us? And why ten? Because that's what it says on the clipboard on the bed only on the bed. Not on the floor. Clear? Not on the ground? Nor standing understood not even standing up? who are these people what they want from us. Honey, five hours is a short time. We'd better get started. Okay, go. alright get going. I think you should get yourself committed up front. just do it. see, it's just as i told you. All in all, I'm glad my discovery went into effect even sooner than I thought. Heritage of all mankind. And it's impressive how quickly the world got back on track. People seem happy again now that the old dear comforts of the past are back. Once transport communications, radio, the television, telephone, washing machine and the automobile were back. The pleasure of returning to living fast returned making the machines work again and resting their own muscles all their muscles except for a few. it's understandable that the one thing that has become indispensable to make it work. almost Incessantly became popular each family is in fact able to produce the energy they need on their own my mashine has now become an essential household appliance. in each sales centre they explain in a few minutes how to use and operate them. Dad, Mom, that's enough. We thank you for your kind attention and we wish you all a good evening drink and be merry because in a few minutes the first episode will air. of the 1997 edition of Sexuality combined with the New Year's Eve raffle. At the end of the evening a cultural debate on the topic school reform in the classroom. explain in your own words a serene family orgy day at home or on a field trip. It was inevitable that sex would become the dominant theme of life and for that reason constantly remembered and depicted in every aspect of industrial design for high society. with the explicit purpose of conditioning the mind of every man to think of only one thing can produce and generate energy. Of course the industrial need of Energy is provided by large power plants that are fed by skilled workers called word vendors. which I assume has originated from a contraction of the primitive definition of an atomic ant. Everything seems to be in order again. it all is perfectly normal. 65 speed up the pace and finish. They're beating the crap out of 104. Seventh case in 24 hours. I don't understand. Instead of providing energy exchange this couple has been steadily decreasing. in the last production week it has experienced a drop of 32 percent over the past week. on the hole? you still haven't figured out what sentiment is. The old sentiment trap they no longer provide because they fall in love they get distracted. you think so? daddy always told me that business doesn't go with the heart. It's not enough to encourage sex. No. No. can you do me another little favor? what favor instead of deciding a new sin, make up a new taboo That's love. Love as a feeling must be discouraged. Forbid love to persecute it. You have to establish that people can mate freely when, how and where they want but without love. Books such as The Betrothed, Romeo and Juliet, Little Flowers of Saint Francis or Snow White and the seven dwarfs must be condemmed as obscene. we must forbid slow dances. Establish censorship of love letters. purge vocabularies of all words that can signify and express affection, feeling, sympathy. Prohibiting walking and holding hands hand out life sentences for innocuous caresses. prohibit prohibit. arested last night in deference to recent legislation issued by the government to strike at the deplorable regurgitations of petty sentimentality in Rome, the policed carried out a complex anti-crime operation exchanging expressions of disgusting tenderness for a more acceptable form of expression the couple were wearing, for the purpose of clear provocation, scandalously clean clothes. They were caught red-handed and charged with indecent exposure. and now a filmed report from our correspondent from Stockholm the awarding of Nobel Prizes has had a particular importance this year. it was in fact awarded for physics and biology to the distinguished Italian scientist Professor Enrico nobili in recognition of his clamorous discovery that brought the world the well-being and serenity that it had lost. Cheers to our famous Nobel Prize winner, scientist and friend of mankind. for him even a woman kneels. In Italy you'd see swimming pools if you knew how hot it was here. But what if someone sees? I don't care. Even though the law now says they can only send those out at funerals. I'd give you a bunch of 'em this big. let's be quiet. But in my god's name. I have a feeling that after she spent some time there. Francesca no longer provides it willingly. after that unfortunate accident I'm a wreck, but you know how it is with people. With friends and guests they find a thousand excuses to say they can't come I'm just annoyed. I'm mortified. You understand it's not a position that people take you'll see that you're wrong and you're definitely wrong. Finally, no one here can see us. We can only hope as much as we like. We can look into each other's eyes without a shadow of lust and hold hands with no lustful purpose. Are you sure that Francesca and that Venturoni are not something different than a pure and simple normal honest carnal intercourse. There was no excuse. The term was sentiment you must be imagining things, dear Renzi you work too much on your imagination. Francesca. Francesca where are you? My husband quick, let's fuck fuck good evening hello good evening You saw that. You have absolutely nothing to worry about. Nothing at all. You don't, but I do. Crazy. As long as sex was considered a sin people thought of nothing else. Now that it has become a social obligation in fact morally it ends up that you don't want to know about it anymore.
