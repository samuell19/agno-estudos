- I'm coming, I'm coming! Hey! - Hey did you hear from the actor's home yet? - They said there'd be a vacancy by New Years. - You know, I still say you're too young to go into a retirement home. - Ah what do you know? - Ah well it's my opinion. - Did Thea make it to New York okay? - Ah yeah, she's already Christmas shopping. - It's not even Thanksgiving yet. - Ah well you know my wife she likes to get it done before Hanukah. - Oh brother. - I hate it when you go away. - Ah honey I'm only going to be gone for three days. - The last time you said that you were gone for five. - Well Becca you know how it is with new jobs. They always want you to do all the dirty work. - You've had enough new jobs to know. - Look when I get back I promise we're going to find a real apartment, okay? - Will I have to change schools again? - We'll just have to make sure that you don't. Okay I've got to hit the road. - Fine. - I'll be back on Thanksgiving. - Fine. - Becca don't be like that. - She'll be okay. You have a good trip. - Thank you. - Gene Kelly was a short little guy. - Are you gonna make a move or what? - My eggs are getting cold. - My wife is five foot six, he was taller than her. - Bert, tell him, will ya? - Well I think you're crazy. You've got a nice little house. - Which I don't need any more. - Knight with your bishop. - Roxie, how tall do you think Kelly was? - Kelly who? - I'm telling you. Before singing in the rain he played a munchkin in the Wizard of Oz. - So, the queen. The queen's a much better move, the queen, the queen. - Look, if you're tired of living in the sticks forget the retirement home. Buy a place in town. - Right. Me and the Rockefellers. - Roxie, your Mrs. Santa Claus commercial ran again last night. - Ooh, kaching! - Any time dearie. Bravo. What's the name of the game? Check mate! - Son of a gun. - How long has it been since you beat him? - Just before Lincoln was assassinated. -You were a better agent than you are a chess player. - I am going Christmas shopping. Anybody want to come? - You too? - Me too what? - Christmas shopping before Thanksgiving? - I've got a batch of grandchildren to buy for. Okay, bye bye boys. - Bye bye. - Later - Be good. - Heather, Becca, come on girls. - She says she's not hungry. - I thought Marie would at least call. You try her cell phone? - Yes, of course I tried her cell. - There must be someone you could call. You try her office? - George it's Thanksgiving. My guess is she got held up, she's driving as fast as she can, she's gonna walk through that door any minute. - Can I help you? - Are you Bertram O'Riley? - Guilty as charged sir. - Hi I'm Officer Lee. Mr. O'Riley, your daughter's in St. Joseph's Hospital in Reseda. She was in a car accident. - Oh my God. Well I gotta go see her. You said St. Joe's right? - Yes sir. - Okay, thanks, thanks a lot. She's just sleeping isn't she? - I'm DR. Burney, - Ah. she's been unconscious since she came in. She got a pretty hard knock on the head which bruised the right side of her brain enough to cause some intercranial bleeding. And of course that's what concerns me the most. - But she's gonna be okay right? - The next few days will tell us a lot. - That poor little girl. What were you doing in L.A.? - She lives here Mr. O'Riley. I'm Kathryn Waters, social services. - But I thought she was living with her mother in San Francisco. Oh my God, has anybody called her? - Your ex-wife has passed on. - Brenda? - Yeah. - When? - About three years ago I believe. When was the last time you actually talked to Marie? - Twelve years ago. Twelve, yeah. - Then you don't know about your granddaughter. - My what? - You have a ten-year old granddaughter. Her name is Rebecca. She's staying with friends from school. Marie is a salesperson for a camera company. So she travels a lot. It was the friend's parents who called the company after Thanksgiving when Marie didn't come home. This is how I located Rebecca. She mentioned you, which brings me to why I'm here. We need you to take temporary custody of Rebecca. It would only be until her mother could take care of her again. - But what about her father? - He's not in the picture. Which leaves you Mr. O'Riley. You're all she's got. - Mr. O'Riley, this is your granddaughter Rebecca. Rebecca, this is your grandfather. - Nice to meet you Rebecca. - That's your favorite sweater, isn't it? - Uh how'd you know that? - Where's the bathroom? - Ah through through the dining room to the right. Okay, Is this everything? - You'll have to pick up the rest of her things from where she was staying. You sign there, and there. - You think she's going to hibernate in that bathroom? - Oh well right now she's upset. Frightened. Angry. - Angry? Angry about what? - At her mom not being here. - Oh. - At this being her fifth school change in three years. At being taken away from her best friend and having to stay here with you. Who she doesn't like very much. - Doesn't like me. She doesn't even know me. - From what I gather her opinion of you comes from her mother and grandmother. - Well then you're right. She doesn't like me very much. Rebecca. Dinner's ready! - I'm not hungry. - But it's my specialty. Chicken tettrazinni. You'll feel better if you eat something. Look, don't worry about your Mom. She... she's gonna be just fine, I know it. - I'm not worried. All of you at home, here for my first holiday special, help me to welcome from London England, Sinjin Baron. - Thank you thank you, Merry Christmas Skip. - Merry Christmas to you Sinjin. Thanks for being with us. - God bless you. Rebecca, time to get up! Rebecca! - I heard you! I need to get in there! I said I need to get... - I heard you! Next! - Mama. - Hello. - Uh Dr. Burney, this is Rebecca, Marie's daughter. - Ah. Hello Rebecca. - Hi. - Your mom's doing much better today. - Is she going to be all right? - I think so. It's just going to take some time, okay? You hang in there. - Uh, can I talk to you outside for a minute Doc? - Of course. - Doc, she's still unconscious! - That's only because we're keeping her that way. - Why? - I have her in a controlled coma to keep her brain from swelling. Your daughter is young, strong and responding well to treatement so I would say right now her prognosis is pretty good. - I guess you know what you're doing Doc, thank you. - Thank you Nicole. - Um hm. - When she wakes up don't tell her that Bert was here. It's a long story. - Hey. What did you mean don't tell her I was here. - Well um I just don't want Mommy getting frazzled. - Well how can she get frazzled knowing I've been to see her? - Well why do you think she hasn't wanted to see you for the past twelve years. - All right Johnny, C'mon out! Please help NO!!!! The boss says I'm to put you in the bag Johnny. Come on Sal, I just need, I just need a little more time. Time's up kid, you know that. - A little early for this isn't it? - Were you in this one? - Yeah, I was the guy with the tommy gun. - Wow, you got old. - Well everybody does. - Do you ever get the girl? - Ah, they usually knock me off about twenty minutes in. I nearly got the girl in that one. - It was a dumb story anyway. These pictures from your old movies? - Uh huh, yep. - I thought you wanted to be a song and dance man in musicals. - I did. - What happened? - Well, this face happened. They took a look at it and they said, you're a heavy. - Grandma said it was because you couldn't dance a lick and you sang like a frog. - Next time you want to get into my stuff, ask. - Big tough guy in movies who actually faints at the sight of blood. - Who said that? - Grandma! Hey. - Look what my mom bought me. - How many can you download? - Thousands. - Ah, this is way cool. - Hi Becca. - Hi Christine. - You must be Becca's grandfather. - Yes ma'am. Bert O'Riley. - It's nice to meet you Bert, this is my husband George. - Hi. If you pop the trunk I'll put these inside. Thanks. - How's she doing? - She's she's better. - Is it true that you've never met your granddaughter before? - Uh, yep. - Isn't it strange that you both live in the same city and you've never met. - Isn't it strange that you'd ask a question that is clearly none of your business. - Can we go up in my room? - Honey we're having lunch with your grandmother remember. We gotta go. - Not even for a minute? - There isn't time Heather. - Well, maybe you could have a sleepover sometime. - Uh that'll be fine. - Awesome. - Can I Mom? - We'll see. - But Mom... - I said we'll see. Come again, Mr. Riley, it was nice to meet you. - Ma'am. - George. - Nice meeting you. - I'll call you. - Okay. - Good luck Becca. - Hey. Hoo hoo hoo. Kind of scary huh? Come here come here. That a girl. You know, I remember my Dad and me sitting on the porch one day, and we had a great big thunder and lightning storm. And boy was I scared stiff. Hoo hoo. And you know what my Dad told me? He said you know where thunder comes from. It's clouds, bumping heads. Um. You didn't buy that, huh? Neither did I. Ha ha ha. Oh boy! You want me to tell you where thunder comes from? Or would you like to hear a nice Welsh lullaby? That my mother used to sing, huh? Okay, let me see if I remember. Sleep my child - Hey! - Hi! - Rebecca Roxie's here. Ah Rebecca, Roxie used to sing on Broadway you know. Did she tell you? - Bert! - And she also had lead in a couple of shows. - Ah, don't you have someplace to go? - Yes. - You're actually going someplace in that sweater? - Why, what's wrong with it? - You tell him. - It's a bit worn out. - Oh but I like it that way. It's comfortable. - Where are you going? - I have to go register you in school. - Wait. You're going to have to drive me to school, right? - That's right. - Then why don't you just drive me to my old school? - Because you see it's in another district. Okay, see you later. - Bye. This is Karl. Besides being your grandfather's agent he's his best friend. They go way back to when Bert first came to Hollywood. - Then he must have known my Grandma, Brenda? - Yes, he did. - Hm - Enough with pictures of old folks. Tell me about your mom. What kind of work does she do? - Well she sells cameras but she really wants to get paid for taking pictures. - Is she a good photographer? - She went to college for it. - Who knew? Must be tough with her in the hospital, hm? - She wouldn't be in the hospital if she had stayed home. - Are you scared about starting a new school? - I wouldn't be doing that either if she had just stayed home. - A little mad at your mom, huh? I changed school a bunch of times. And it always scared the heck out of me. I didn't make friends very easy. - I don't make friends easily either. - Somehow I kind of knew that. I think I'll get a cup of coffee. - Ok -Oh her she is. - Ashley this is Mr. O'Riley. - Hello. - Hi. - Mr. O'Riley has a granddaughter Rebecca who is starting here tomorrow. You'll be her buddy. - Cool. - Ashley will show Rebecca the ropes, get her fixed up with a locker, take her to Mr. Bourdreaux class and uh introduce her around. - That's terrific. She was in the same boat last year. -Yeah. I'll see you in the office first thing in the morning. - Yes Mrs. Ortiz. Bye. - Bye. - We'll see Rebecca in the morning then. - Oh oh that you will ma'am and thank you. Thank you very much. -You're welcome. - Bye bye now. - Bye - So you moved a lot huh? - A lot. - When I was your age, because of all the moving, there was one special thing that I always wanted for Christmas. You know what that was? My own chimney for Santa to come down. - And you were ten? - Well, Santa and the chimney were just a symbol, what it meant was I was in a safe place where I wanted to be for a very long time. - My grandma was a singer. - I know. - She used to sing to me. I miss that. - Would you like me to sing to you? - Okay. - Well come on. Ho ho ho who wouldn't go? click click, good St. Nick. - That was awesome! - Now what about you? I bet some of those genes have been passed on to you. - My grandma taught me a little bit but, I've never sung for anyone before. - Why not? - I don't know. - What other carols do you like? - Jingle bells? - Come on, let's do it together. - Okay. - One more time, come on, let's pick it up from the top. - Okay. bells, it is to ride in sing Jingle bells, jingle bells, - Hey. - Very nice! Very nice. - Did you know this girl could sing like that? - I did not. Oh. You hear that? -Hear what? - The fat lady singing. Ooh hoo, ooh hoo, check mate. - You turkey. - ha ha ha ha ha... - Can I play? - This ain't checker's you know. - I know. - You know how to move the pieces? - I read a book once. - Hey, move over Karl, let her sit there. - All right. Hey uh, how about a wager? - A what? - You know. A bet. - Well I don't have any money. - You see that if I win you don't get to slam the bedroom door for a whole week. - Well, what if I win? I get to burn that thing you're wearing. - Well you can't burn that that's his favorite sweater. - Okay then I get to bury it. - It's a bet. All right. Now look. I'll even turn this around and give you the white so you can make the first move. - How's that? - All right. - All right. - Okay, so these move straight ahead? - Yeah. - Okay now. This moves straight ahead and then one move to either side? - No that's the way a knight moves, you have a bishop there that can only move diagonally. - Right, okay. - Ah ha. Looks better all the time. - These can move anyway they want? - Yeah - Okay. - Ah ha. I think you better go back and study that book some more. - Do you hear that? - What? - It's the fat lady singing. Check mate. - Check mate! She got you with a fool's mate I don't believe it. - If you want I can give you my book to study. - Aw, aw... - Aw, it cost me seven bucks. - You got your money's worth. When are you going to set up your Christmas tree? - I don't do Christmas trees. - Mom and I always have the prettiest one around, anywhere. How old was my Mom when you left Grandma? - How did we go from Christmas trees to ancient history? - Did you know it's evasive to answer a question with a question? - And where did you possibly learn that? - Doctor Phil. - You know what evasive means? - So? - So what? - So how old was my Mom when you left Grandma? - I don't know around two I guess. - Two and a half. - Well if you knew why did you ask me? - Why did you leave? - Who said I left? - Grandma. - Oh. - So, why did you? - Well you got all the answers, you tell me? - Because you didn't want Mom. - Who told you that? - Grandma! - Ah! Grandpa finally what kept you? - Don't ask. You know I never knew that getting a ten year old girl off to school was like going to war! - So did you get her there? - Yeah, just. Hey buddy, a little bit over to the left. That's it. - Who asked you. - Ah. - How is Marie doing? - Doc wake her up yet? - Not yet, but they say she's stable. So we just have to wait. - She's going to be okay Bert. - Adam's right about that. - I hope so. Thank you. - Roxie tells us that Rebecca can sing. - Hey - When are Adam and I going to meet her? - Oh soon, soon I'm sure. - Didn't want to feed her to the lions all at once huh? - Are you kidding? She'd have you for breakfast and gnaw on your bones between meals. - Takes after her grandmother huh? - Her mother too, I think. - It doesn't matter who she takes after. - You're getting a granddaughter for Christmas, she's getting a Grandpa, and you should count yourself lucky. - What are you guys ganging up on me or something? -Well, I'm not ganging up. What about you Roxie? - I think so. Carl? -Mm hmm, Jack? - Did I say something I don't remember? - Oh good, now I can order breakfast, right? Alex! - Hm? - My usual. - Sure. - So your Grandpa was a movie star? - Um, not exactly. He wanted to sing and dance in musicals, but he was too ugly, so they made him a bad guy. - Can you sing? - A little. - You should try out for the Christmas Pageant. It's a good way to meet a lot of kids. - Hm? - You got your homework okay? - In my backpack. - See you in the morning. - Thanks for doing my braids. - Any time. - Rebecca, the doctor just called, your mother's awake! - Is she okay, is she coming home? - No, but you'll be able to talk to her. - Mama? -Hey baby. Oh, I've been waiting for this. - Me too. - I miss that face. - You don't have to anymore. - You okay honey? - Sure. - The doctor said that you are staying with Bert. - Yeah. - Is he here? - Um, he didn't want to come in. - That sounds like Bert. How you doing with him honey? - It's not as bad as I thought. - Mr. O'Riley. Aren't you going in? Rebecca, I hate to break this up but I'm going to have to chase you out. - She just got here. - Your pain meds should be kicking in about now. - Yeah they are. - Then you really need to rest. - I'm sorry baby. - It's okay. - In a day or two you can stay longer, okay? - Okay. Bye. I love you. - I love you honey. - Bye. Thanks. - She looks better don't you think? - A lot better than before. - Yeah. - You should have come in. - Ah ha, good. - Yeah? - I uh, I washed your clothes. And and this one seems to have changed color a little bit. - Uh. You've got to be joking. That blouse is my favorite. - Well it's it's pink, it's a girls color. - It's streaky pink. - What's wrong with that? - I wouldn't be seen dead in it. - Oh boy I guess we got a problem because all of the rest of your whites are streaky pink too. - I can't believe this. - Well sorry, I tried. - Looks like you're going to have to pony up and buy me some new clothes. - Me buy girls clothes? - I don't see anyone else in the room. Hi! - Hey. Ha ha ha. I owe you big time young lady. - We're going to have a great time spending your money. Right? - Right. - Just don't bring anything home that's streaky pink. - See ya. - Careful! Ha ha ha. - Bye. - I like everything we got you. Especially the shoes. - Yeah. Everything is way cool, especially the shoes. Thanks Roxie. - Hey it was fun. - My school is having a Christmas Pageant. - Are you going to be in it? - You have to try out first. - I think you should. - I've never sung in public before. - Ah you'll knock em dead. - You think? - I know. - I was wondering, maybe you could help me pick out a song? Um, I mean if I decide to do it. - Sure. I'll help you with the song. I think you should ask Bert too. That is if you decide to do it. - Why won't he put up a Christmas tree? - Who? - Bert. - Been that way ever since I've known him. - Rebecca? Breakfast is ready. Is that outfit your idea or Roxie's? - Both. - I'll be ganged up on. - I like scrambled eggs. - I forgot eggs. - All right. Then I'll just have a glass of milk, - All right. Then I'll just have a glass of milk, unless you forgot that too. unless you forgot that too. - Madam, your milk, and here's your bologna sandwich. - You know, I like peanut butter and jelly. - You're going to love bologna. He he he. You know the more I look at that outfit the better I like it. It it looks - awesome! - Thanks. - Yeah. You know Karl, she's always asking me questions she already has answers to. - Maybe she's not so sure that she does. - Ah well what do you mean? - The answers that she has uh came from somebody else. Now she's just double checking with you. - Grandchildren are really different huh Karl? - How so? - When I look at her, A kid that I had nothing to do with creating and yet I had everything to do with it. - Gives you a sense of continuity. - Yeah. I kind of like it. Ooh, ooh I got to go pick up Becca. - We're in the middle of a chess game. - So steady the board and I'll be back in a few minutes. And don't you dare change anything on that board. Believe me I'll know if you did. - Come on. - It's great you're going to do it. - Yeah, I just hope I don't freak out and bite it on stage. - You'll be cool. What are you going to sing? - I don't know yet. How about you? - Me? In front of all those people? Are you crazy? - I thought that you were going to... - I help with the lights and things. - Oh. - Catch you tomorrow.

Wh -what's going on? - I'm going to try out for my school Christmas Pageant. - Singing? - Well duh. - Excellent. - When? - This Friday after school. - Well that's not much time. - Well, I asked Roxie if she'd help me pick out a song. - Great, that's great. Roxie, yeah. - I was wondering if maybe you'd help me too. - Once upon a time your grandfather had an excellent singing voice. - Grandma didn't think so. - Well your Grandma never saw all those wonderful musicals he put on when he was teaching at Glendale College. - You directed musicals? - You didn't know that already? - No. So you'll help me, maybe teach me a move or two? - I'd love to. - Awesome. - Ha ha ha. - It's your move Bert. - Um, oh. - It doesn't look good for you Mr. Sugarman. - No it never does, never does. - We'll see uh. - Check. And mate. - Yeah and it took two of you to do it. - I didn't say a word. - Didn't say a word. What's that? - Do you remember that show Manhattan Lights? - All I remember is it closed after a week. Ha ha ha. - Ha. Well this song is from that show. - Oh? Huh. Hey, Roxie just found a fun song for ya. - Oh ha ha ha. - She thinks it'll show off your voice. - What do you think? - Give it a try. The lyrics are in the book there. - Okay. - Okay, here... - I'll show you, hm. They say, why try, - Okay? - Okay now you try it. - They say, why try, - I - I -I'm confused. - Don't worry we'll work on it. - Yeah and in the interlude you know you can always do a little soft shoe. - I don't know how to do that. - Ah, I'll teach you. - Grandma said... - I can't dance a lick I know. Don't believe everything you hear. - You just have to sell it. Have a lot of fun. - Yeah. You know give it that old personality. - You guys really think I can do this? - Oh yeah. - They say why try, ending. walk away while you can. They say bad break tough luck your plan fell flat but I say hey, we'll see about that. If I put one foot in front of the other I know I'll find my way. Put your money on me I'm a long shot who's going to pay. Why can't they see it. They say give in, get out failure is looking at you. They say give up, slink away while you can. They say hapless, hopeless, your dream went flat, but I say hey, we'll see about that. I'll make good, there's no doubt cause I'm too dumb to give up say. I say hey, I say hey, we'll see about that. -Woo! - Bert please. - Bert stop it. - All right, all right. I know I know. - Hey. It's about time. - Hey. - Hello. - Rebecca, this is Mr. Johnson. - You just call me Adam. - Yeah, he danced in the movies you know. But he was so bad they made him a choreographer. - Get out of town. - And this is Mr. Jack Fast. He was a leading man on stage. Ah now that is when he was a handsome man. - I was good-looking? When was that I forgot. - Roxie told us all about your audition. - She said it was a smash. - I don't know about that. - When are we gonna hear? - Oh sometime this morning. I - I knew we'd all be here so I left word we... Oh I better go tell Alex. - You need any help with your dancing, I'm your guy. - He is too. - Now um Karl, you've known Bert for a long time right? - Oh yeah. -Then maybe you can tell me why he won't put up a Christmas tree? - Well uh, I think it has something to do with the fact that it was Christmas Eve when he and your Grandma separated. - Oh. - All I know is he hasn't put up a tree since then. - Very nice. - Well, all we got to do is wait for the call. - And no matter what happens this time I want you to know I am very proud of you. - You bet. You had a lot of courage to do what you did. - Diner. Yeah let me get him. Bert phone. - Talk about timing huh, wow. Hello? Rebecca, I'm sorry. But you're in. And not only that but you got a solo number. - Yay! - You need any help with that dancing. - A toast a toast to Rebecca. - Yay! - To Rebecca! - Hello. - DR. BURNEY. - Yes doctor. - They're releasing Marie from the ICU. - That's wonderful doctor. - I'll see you then. - Yes doctor. Thank you very much. - All right. - Oh boy. Oh Rebecca, - What? - Guess what? - Your mom's out of intensive care. - Really? - I'm sure she'd love to talk to you. You can tell her about the pageant. - Yeah. - Huh? Ha ha ha. What room did they say she was in? - 2125. - Oh. Oh here. You go ahead in, I'll wait here. - All right. - Hi. - Hi. - Where's Bert? - He's just outside. - Tell him to come in. - Okay. She wants to see you. - Me? You - you're looking... - Terrible. I know. - No but you're here. That's that's what counts. - Guess I almost wasn't. Listen I want to thank you. - For what? - For taking in my little girl. - She's family. - Don't even go there Bert. - Oh yeah, well... - But I meant it when I said thank you. - Oh, she's gonna be in a school Christmas pageant. - You singing? - Yeah. - And dance. - That's great honey. - Look I know she wants to tell you all about it so I'll just skidoo and I'll be back in a bit. - So listen I want you to tell me everything that's going on. - Okay. - I'm afraid the brain bleed has caused some motor nerve damage. - Well what does that mean? - She has trouble using her left leg. And her balance is a bit unsteady. - Will that be permanent? - Well we'll know more when she gets into therapy. But she's going to need some help when she leaves here. - That's wonderful... Your grandma would be so proud of you. - The shows on Christmas Eve, do you think you'll be able to come? - Dressed in silver bells. - I couldn't have done it without Bert. He, he's really not a bad man like you and Grandma said. - Just be careful honey. - You said that before. What do you mean? - He wasn't there for your Grandma and me when we needed him the most. - Are you ever going to say anything to Marie? - About what? - Ah come on you know what I'm talking about. All Marie knows is what Brenda told her which in turn has been passed down to Becca. Don't you think it's about time you broke the chain with a little truth? - I can't Karl. That would be like stomping on her mother's grave. - Well what are you going to do when Marie gets out of the hospital? - I don't know. I just don't know. I gotta get going. - Where you off to? - It's a surprise. - it's open. - Come on, we're going someplace. - I can't. I've got homework. - Oh, so you don't want a Christmas tree, huh? - I haven't got room on my dresser. - I'm talking about a big one here. Big enough to go right up to the living room ceiling. - I get to pick? - Absolutely. - Awesome. - Okay. - You sure you like this tree? - Yes! - I kind of like the one I picked out. It was fuller. - No it was scrawny. Besides you said I get to pick. - You see it on top of the car don't you? - Thank you. - Ha ha ha. Say have you given any thought to what you'd like for Christmas? - I don't know yet. - You better start thinking about it young lady. Ha ha ha. Hey! How about a tree decorating party? - Cool! - Huh? Maybe we'll invite Roxie and Karl, everybody! - Ashley could sleep over and maybe Heather. - Have you talked to her yet? - She's never home when I call. - Well. Huh. Well as far as I'm concerned you can invite the queen of England if you like. All right. - Blanch the carrots? What the heck does that mean? - Are you cooking? - No I'm uh I'm getting ready to wash a horse, of course I'm cooking. - Cool, I get to eat something that hasn't been frozen before. - Don't get sassy with me. Ha ha ha. Oh, Roxie and Karl are coming too. - Oh, and Ashley can come to the party. -Oh good. Did you get a hold of Heather? - No, but I'll keep on trying. - Oh Rebecca, I'm proud of you, your own solo. Cool man, woo hoo! - Come in. Whoa! - See what I got for your mom? - Cool. Can we bring it to her right now? - Oh I'm afraid she'll be sleeping right now. - Well, what about tomorrow morning. - Hey, good idea. All right we'll do it. I'll leave it right here. Eh? Night night. - Good night. - Now listen. You and your mom need a little one on one. So you go ahead in. - Don't you want to come in? - I'll wait in the lobby, okay? - All right. - Wow! Is that for me? - Yeah. - That is beautiful. Thank you baby. - Bert picked it out. - Sounds like you two are really hitting it off. - Most of the time. - Oh I talked to Sally this morning. - San Francisco Sally? - That's the one. She said as soon as I get out of here that we can go up there and bunk with her until I get on my feet. - Move back to San Francisco? - Yeah, what do you think about that? You've got lots of friends up there. - What if I don't want to go back? - Well then Becca I don't know what to do. - Maybe I'll just stay with Bert. - That is not going to happen. - I'm not going back. - I told you to be careful of him. - And you told me that he was never there for you when you needed him but he's been there for me. - Becca. - Hi, it's Becca. Heather please call me back. I want to invite you to our tree-trimming party. - Mom, I want to go. - Heather I already said no. - But Mom... - Her grandfather was rude to your mom Honey. - Don't I get a vote in this? - No. - She's my best friend. - And when Marie is feeling better you'll see her. Until then you can keep yourself busy by helping me setting the table. - Heather! - Heather! - Sounds like it would be fun. - Sounds like it would be fun. - You've got to come. - Mom won't let me. - Why? What did you say to Heather's mom? - What are you talking about? - Heather can't come over tonight because you were rude to her Mom. Thanks Bert. Thanks a lot. - Oh brother. Ma'am we've got to talk. - Icicles, we got any old-fashioned icicles? - Bert's out getting them right now. - Here, you need a big one up there. - You got more ornaments here than the tree in Central Park. Bert doesn't need to go out and get more. - He doesn't know from enough. - I got it. - Hey. - Hi. Bye Mom. - Bye Honey. - Guys, this is Ashley. - Hi. - Hello. Hi Ashley. - Come on, we'll put your bag in my room. - Anybody want any egg nog? Nothing in it but egg and nog. And a little nutmeg on the top. - I'd love one. - Me too, me too. - Did you get the icicles? - Ah, they were out of everything. - Great tree. Great tree. - Oh yeah. Rebecca herself picked it out.

Those three they're like the three musketeers. Ha ha ha. Boy she she really misses you Marie. She sure does. When you get out of here why don't you come stay at my house until you get back on your feet? You know? And that way Becca won't have to change schools. She really likes it where she's at. And you why you you can go back to your art and start taking pictures again. - I don't know Bert. - I just don't want Becca to miss out on what you missed out on. That's all I want. - Good morning. - Good morning. What's this? - A pre-Christmas present. Go on open it. - Cool. Awesome! - That's exactly what I would have said. - Thank you so much Grandpa. - Where you going? - I gotta call Ashley and Heather. - Of course. Grandpa. Grandpa. la. La la la la la la la. - What's the matter don't you guys here the phone? - We knew it wasn't for us. - I'm coming. I'm coming. Hello? - Mr. O'Riley? It's Mrs. Ortiz from the school. - Oh yes Mrs. Ortiz what can I do for you? - I'm afraid that Mrs. Casterline, our director for the Christmas Show has had to go up to Oregon on family matters. - Oh well I hope everything's okay. Oh you're not going to cancel the show are you ma'am? - No, no. Now from what I hear from Rebecca you were a terrific song and dance man. - Who said that, Rebecca? - She also tells me that you directed a lot of musicals when you taught. - Oh. - Well. Who was it? - Yeah, who was it? - Don't play innocent with me. - Okay so we knew. But not until Becca told us about a half hour ago. - Did you say yes or no? - It would give you a chance to direct Rebecca. - I'll do it only if the gang pitches in. Roxie that means you on music. - Well, how can I say no. - Awesome. - Well, I'll negotiate. - And Adam has already agreed to help us with the choreography. - Well then, I guess I'm your new director. - Sweet! Yahoo. - Do I still get my solo. - Well duh! - Grandpa, you're aces. - Ha ha ha ha. - And kick, and kick... All right guys. God willing and the creek don't rise, this show will be ready in three days. - Yes! -Oh Becca. - Grandpa? Grandpa. Grandpa! Grandpa are you okay? Grandpa. Help somebody. Grandpa. - Is he okay? - Grandpa. - Call 911. - Thanks for letting me know. - You're just a floor away you know. - Is there any news? - No not yet. - Hi I'm Roxie. A friend of your dad's. - Hi. Oh uh where's Becca? - Oh, she ran to get a soda and snack at the vending machine. - He's doing okay. They did an angiogram, and found blockage of two of the coronary arteries. What they are doing now is an angioplasty that will open the blockage and leave a mesh stent behind that will keep them open. We've done thousands of these before so he's in good hands. I'll come out as soon as they're done, okay? - Thank you doctor. - Uh, I'll go find Becca. You want a coffee? - Sure. - Your dad worships you you know. He has since you were a little baby. - Well he had a funny way of showing it. - Marie, anybody ever told you how uh he and Brenda split up? - Well yeah he walked out on Mom. - Well they were working in a dinner theater. You were about two years old at this time. Anyway there was this director Russell, he had his eye on your mom, and he fired Bert from the company. - So what are you saying? - Your mom was twenty years younger than Bert. She wanted to be a star. Russell said he'd make her one. That's what she wanted to hear. So, she took you and left with Russell on Christmas Eve. Well he kept you guys around for about a year. And then he split. She tried to get back together with Bert but he had his heart broken once, and he wasn't going to let it happen again. She got damn mad and that's when she took you and moved to San Francisco. - Wait a minute, my Mom never said anything about a guy named Russell. - Well I'm sure she didn't. - You know Karl, she worked damn hard to raise me without any help from Bert. Even when we really needed him. - When was that. - Well, when we asked him to help pay for my college tuition and he refused. - No, Bert paid for everything. Everything. He and I sat in the balcony at your graduation. - Hello. - Is Grandpa going to be okay? - He's going to be fine. - Oh good. - He's going to be in recovery for a while so I suggest you come back first thing in the morning. - Okay. Um hm. - I'll have to check you out of here. But I want to see you in my office tomorrow. - Thank you doctor. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas to you too. - All right sleepy head. Let's go. - Where are we going? - Well for now we're going to go to Berts. - Will you chill out? Karl and I can handle the pageant without you. - I worry about it. - Bert. You got everything ready to go. All you got to do is watch. You just stay here and rest. - Yeah, I got a choice? - We have to go. Don't get up. - I mean it. Get some rest. - Yes ma'am, thank you. - Oh, hi. - God help you, he's all yours. - Oh, come in come in. Wh - where's Becca? - She's having a play date with the other musketeers. - How, how's your leg? - Uh it's okay. I'm starting therapy tomorrow so... - And you're driving okay? - You don't need your left leg for that. -Ah How about you. What'd the doc say? - Oh no damage to the heart thanks to Becca. I just gotta stay here a couple of days for observation. - So you going to miss the pageant? - Oh, the gang'll take care of that. Heh. Nobody'll notice that I'm not there. What's wrong Marie? - Karl told me some things about Mom. Some really rotten things. - Oh brother. He's my best friend you expect him to say some nice things? Marie, your mother and I were at war. And you were caught in the middle. - So if it's true, then why didn't you fight for me? - I did. I did for a long time. And then... - Okay, show time let's go. Grab the door. - Let's go. - Hello everybody. Come on in. - Hi! - Here you go you can get a program there. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Mr. Lawrence hello. - Hi, how are you? - Good thank you. Put your beard on. Bert, we changed the lights just the way you wanted. - But what about Becca's solo. Did Roxie go through it with her again? - Oh yeah yeah she did. Now listen.
