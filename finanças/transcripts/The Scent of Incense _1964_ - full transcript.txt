Mayor! Hill 203 (The Russian fortress at Port Arthur) has surrendered. Surrendered? That's great news! Hip hip hurrah! Hip hip hurrah! (she holds a funeral tablet) crowds shout "hurrah!" It's selfish and you didn't ask permission! Why should I ask anyone. It's about me! You married into another family... You're not divorced. You are still part of this family. You did it without even asking permission. If it's too much trouble to leave Tomoko with you then I will take her with me. The family agreed that I could bring her. You've already arranged this? And not told me? Tomoko is the heir to this place so I thought I should leave her here. If I'm wrong please tell me! But you... Isn't it wrong towards (the late) Seikichi? It's not yet 3 years since he died, - I told his spirit at the altar. I also asked him why he died before me! He was so selfish, leaving me like that. - You are in no position to complain! Your new groom may be a landowner but he's got three kids and you're a second wife! You don't know how tough that will be. He promised me I wouldn't have a hard time... - A ridiculous promise! He is who he is. It will always be tough living with a mother-in-law. Mother, I think you're jealous. You're still pretty, you don't look as if you're in your 40s. You should look after Tomoko! - Ikuyo! Not be tied to this little landowner's house! Hello Hachiran! Is Ito-san at home? What's with him? Yes, coming! Can you pop in here please. Is that a doll's futon you're making? Nice job! Thank you! Congratulations. Marui-san! Your business should be selling clothes... But you seem to be playing at being a marriage broker! Ito-san is special... I heard that from the young master of the Kosaka family. He's a nice guy. When his wife died... My wife asked me in jest if I could die as well so she could marry him! He was in love with Ito-san before she married Keisuke and finally... It's a shame to ask with her husband recently deceased but... Since Kosaka's wife suddenly dropped dead... It just goes to show life can be brief. And I was asked to act as a messenger so... Marui-san! - Coming! Excuse me. At least it's good for my business! Hello. - Please come in. I'll just pop inside then. Ito-san, you're always beautiful. What did you bring today? - Lots of things! (sings) "go to sleep" "crying child..." They're beautiful. But maybe too plain for me? Well, for you perhaps... How about this one? - Yes, that's good. That really suits you. - Really? You're so pretty... "sleep baby sleep" "If you don't stop crying you will be spirited away (kamikakushi)" "If you sleep then mother will stay with you!" She's not dressed appropriately! Don't blame me! Your own daughter's wedding, you should do! Dressed like that! At her age! It's unheard of! She only thunks of herself, it's so unkind to me! Tomoko, your mother doesn't listen to me She left us both and married. It's not right! Mother looks so beautiful! She's not marrying in white then? No, a second marriage. It's strange to be dressed in white for a second marriage. She wore white for her ex-husband's funeral though! Wearing white at a funeral should indicate you'll never remarry! And her hair has been done in that inappropriate style. "Mother" Hachiran, you should call me "Ito-san" I can't do that! - Why not? There's already an Ito-san! Who? - Your mother! But she's gone now. So I'm Ito-san. No way! - I don't like you. You always take my mother's side. - I was brought up with her since we were kids. You fancy my mum, don't you? Don't look! You do miss her, don't you? I don't miss her at all! - Liar! (Tomoko! Come here!) No, stay there. It's up to me what Tomoko wears. You stay out of it. I won't interfere. Raise her as you like. But I would never put her in that kind of common clothing! Tomoko's going to the school now. That posh kimono is not appropriate. My child will do what I want. There's no point being angry and saying "my child" She's the heir here. She's not part of your family register! Don't interfere and make her unhappy. Is this how to treat the child you bore? You should concentrate on looking after your coming child. Please leave me and Tomoko, I need to see her. You don't treat me as your mother. She won't treat you as her mother either. I'll show you whether or not I'm her mother! Tomoko! Come here! - Stay there! Come here! - No, you mustn't! This is the dress I made for you specially! Try it on. We mustn't receive it! - Good-bye! Idiot! You disrespectful, unfilial daughter! Unfilial daughter! Tomoko! You must not wear that kind of thing. Damn it! Grandma? Grandma? Grandma? Grandma! Where are you? Grandma! Grandma. Come on, talk to me! What's happened? - Grandma! Get the doctor quickly. The baby's so noisy it's driving me mad. This will end up driving me crazy, just like my mother! Don't get angry. Kids cry! Why should woman have to bear children! It's giving me a headache. All the things you promised me, none of them actually happened! And I've given birth to this awful child. If I have to stay here I'll kill the child and then myself. OK we'll go. But please don't say such disturbing things! You keep me trapped here. What more do you want? I told you I will do something about it. Just be patient. Why must I be patient? You don't like me and you're just waiting for me to leave. There's insanity in my family! I don't believe that. - Your parents are ready to get rid of me for it though! If you want to divorce me, why not do it? We've just had a baby. Don't be ridiculous. You've got three kids already. And now this horrible one. Don't say that. I can't bear being in this house any longer... You must be patient. We need to get out of this house straight away. Stop saying that! (Shhhh, there there!) I can't bear it! Hey! Something terrible's happened. What's up? - Ikuyo's gone! Pull yourself together! You've not been eating and this is no time to be off your head. Ikuyo's pregnant... and gone off! Didn't she contact you before she left? I don't know anything. If you don't tell his parents all you know... You're partly responsible. I don't know anything! Because of your madness Ikuyo is already in a bad position with his family. You need to get better and go and see them. She has persuaded their son to go off to Tokyo with her. I don't know anything about it. You're her mother! You can't be so casual about this. Leave me. I don't want to see anyone. You've really lost your mind! (TOKYO) You're early today. If you're going to the bathhouse you should take the kid. She was sleeping peacefully. Somebody was here. They took away the bowls. Lots of people come. It's not just our place. And there's no need to have sake at lunchtime. It's a Semba (big merchant house) tradition. He brings the clothing so it's normal to offer him a drink. I don't have money. You do. You paid for the food delivery. Has the last money I gave you all gone? - What do you expect! Money soon disappears if you buy sake. Four bottles is no great expense. Even if I don't buy sake there's none left. I suppose you're right. Why don't you give up the bookshop? And get a more classy job. Don't be cruel! We're a married couple. I don't care about a trip to Shiobara. I want to go to the Teikoku (imperial) theatre! That new one that just opened? I went the other day. Why not walk past it, anyone can! - No, I want to go to a show! Yasuko, which parent do you resemble then? What a pretty face. It's a telegram! Yes, it came at lunchtime. It's from the Sunagas. "Mother critically ill" Your mother's really sick! (Telegram for you) Is she dead? "Mother critically ill. Come immediately" Again! - What do you mean "again"? What are you going to do? Do? There's nothing I can do. If they want you back it may be about the money. There's no point. But it's your mother. - I don't think of her that way. There's nothing much but let's have dinner. Mr Kosaka! Telegram. "Mother dead" Telegram for Kosaka. "Come!" (signed Tomoko) (Buddhist funeral chanting) It's very sad. Ikuyo only came at the last minute What's Tomoko going to do? Why go over it again. There's no alternative. Just because I don't complain about it! Unlike you. Think about my position. - You're the eldest son! Why can't you ask for a few hundred yen, you're the heir! You're dreaming. I ran out and left the kids. How can I face them at this point? If you've left the house will go to your younger brother. So why not ask him for a hundred yen. - Well yes but... My father and mother are both very stubborn. What is it? - You should go back to Kishu! I told you it's no good. - No, not that... Not to ask for money. Bring Tomoko! Why? Well she is my daughter. She's all alone now Grandma's dead. If I don't take her what will happen to her? I'm her mother! I'm fed up with you and the things you say. There's no need to get annoyed. - Really? You, me and the baby can barely scrape by. If we have another mouth to feed we... - Go and get her! What are you like! (Shizuoka) Stop that! Your nose is all red! We need to get rid of that cold. I wonder where they're going. Troop... HALT. Squad dismiss! Reassemble here in one hour! Yes Sir! Salute! The master and mistress are through here. Excuse me. I have brought them. What's your name? - Tomoko Sunaga. Tomo is written 朋 And how old are you? - Ten. Stand up. Turn sideways. Sit down. Do you like dance and music? What have you learned. - Nothing So how do you know whether you like them? - I know I would if I did them. She's quite a delicate child for a big guy like you to have had. But she's not mine. Did you adopt her? - No. She's my wife's daughter. Your wife's? A child from her first marriage? - Yes I think she might have some aptitude! Tell your wife the girl will be looked after. Thank you. Our prostitutes and our geisha are separate, but live together. We train our live-in geisha hard. Being a geisha from here is a big deal. We are famous far and wide (along the naka sendo). She seems pretty tough in mind and body. Let's give her the skills and train her. Thank you very much. - It must have been tough for you. It's unusual to have an intermediary come with her not her actual parent. Yes, well... Take her up to the room. Put her things in here. This is the geisha room. The oiran (courtesans) are in the other room. This will be your room. Your father should leave. - Of course. Take care, Tomoko. No, that's wrong! I've told you so many times and you still don't get it. You're stupid! Sorry! That's teriible. Start again. You really don't get it! She's taking out her anger at her husband's affair on Tomoko. Tomoko puts up with it really well. She never cries. With such harsh training I know she'll learn but... I'm worried she'll break the shamisen! I think she'll get really good. She never runs away. She's good at school too! - So they say. Her teacher said she can't have time off for geisha training. But the madam says she can stay at school to the end of year 6. It's pretty rough on Tomoko though! With girls who aren't so young... Even if their faces look pretty their bodies have gone completely downhill. She will pay back the loan before that! I wonder... Although she's not as young as she said she was. A Patron is a man and attracted to something different from us. We're professionals! You can't tell the value until after you've bought it! How right you are. It's me. I'm back. Welcome back. Whether or not she'll sell... it needs some thought She will. At least at the beginning just because she's new. What about her name? - It's a good name. Make some fresh tea. Konoe is here. - OK She looks pretty. Today is just as a first meeting. I understand. You really are pretty. You're pretty so you'll be able to repay the debt quickly. Work hard and repay the loan quickly. I understand. - You may go. Leave the door open. What about the tea? What is it? Yes. - What do you mean "yes"? You're from Tokyo... You know that oiran (courtesan), don't you. Yes. - Who is she? My mother. What did she say? But you have a different family name... Get me the document box from over there. My mother has a different surname. My mother is Ikuyo Kosaka. My surname is Sunada. Why is it complicated like that? When my mother married the first time... there was only a daughter They made me the heir to the Sunada part of the family. Kosaka is the name of the second man mother married. She's here as Ikuyo Tazawa. No, Tazawa is the surname of her first husband, my father. But on the contract it... - She was sold by a guy. She was divorced. The step-father who brought her here. The go-between was unreliable. She's lied about her age. Her child is already 13. If she had her at 17 she'd be 30 now. According to this contract she's 25 She's well past her prime. Shall I get Konoe? - No, our mistake. There's no point making a fuss about it now. Instead... Hey, kid. Yes? - You must never call her mother even when you're together. I understand. - She must be a stranger to you. Very well. You have all the luck! She's a great Oiran. She's been top oiran for 2 months so my place is deserted! No, it's a different group of customers to yours. One of my customers left his usual geisha at my place. And booked your oiran for 10 days! Come on Komatsu, don't blame me! Oh I'm not complaining... This used to be a high class place, although soldiers come as well. Such a splendid Oiran makes business good for all of us. Business is suddenly booming! (like it has burst into bloom) Of course she's popular. She'll have anyone. She's very popular amongst the soldiers as well. She's so stuck up! She's in the best room all day long! She wants to show that she's different to us! I can't stand her. Hey you there... Hey good looking... Hey... Oiran, it's me. Why not take a break. I've brought some sushi. I chose the white fish that you like. I'll make some tea. Tea is the last thing I want. I'm grinding tea all day long! I just want water. It looks to be low quality stuff. So it's probably not very nice. How dare you! I am feeding her well enough. You shouldn't do this! I'm sorry. - You mustn't come here. Lying about being 25. And whoever heard of an Oiran with a child! Pregnant with the child of the man who sold you... I've lost face with the master. Hurry up and grind that tea. I told you the sushi wasn't good! Mother... You'll get told off if you call me that. There's a strange smell. Partly sweat and partly tea-leaves. Both of which are disgusting. Can I have seconds please. Thank you for the meal. Sweet bean jelly from Tsurugaya, with white beans too... I'd love to eat an ordinary bean cake. Here you are. - Thank you. She normally wants the posh stuff, her standards have slipped! Abekawa bean cakes (famous local Shizuoka variety) Excuse me. Who is it? - Me. Come in then. I thought you might like something sweet so I brought Abekawa mochi. Here you are. I don't want this. I like richer and heavier sweets. Mount Fuji looks so beautiful! I'm used to it. It's nothing special. Tomoko... Mother! It's not something to be shocked by. You've become a woman. Tokyo Good evening. Come over here Maria-chan. Wow! Stunning. Whose party were you at up until this hour? It's a secret! - You're still a child, you don't have secrets yet. Nice to meet you. You're wearing your hair differently... It's called a yuigata isn't it? - Yes, that's right. It's different to yours... You're not aware of the significance! I see... (it means she's no longer a virgin) Please allow me to pour you a glass. That means she's been initiated! The time has come, has it? Mr Nozawa, you must behave yourself. Time for a refill. Maria! Come over here next to me. - I don't want to. I'm getting on very well with these people. I want to congratulate you. Let's celebrate the change of your hair! Come here and stick out your lips! - No! I shan't. Here he goes again! Help me catch her. Don't make a fuss. Don't do that! Mr Nozawa seriously told me that... She's the only girl he's not been able to kiss. Even if it costs 10,000 I want her. Give her to me. You should be honoured by his attention! - You're a lucky girl! It's marvellous to become such an experienced geisha so quickly... Please set everything up for the occasion. I couldn't say no. I'm so pleased all my hard work has paid off. You put everything into raising her. At the beginning it was hard to get rid of her countrified ways. Why not take your mother too? Everyone knows. We couldn't keep it hidden. Hi lads... Why don't you pop in! Long time no see! Don't walk past! Why not come and have a look! Come and see the oiran! I was taken in by her photo! You can see the heavy make up to hide her age! I didn't realise what was under all that make up before I bought her! I know things have been difficult. But that's over. But you must put it behind you and move on. I will. Pour her a drink. So it's farewell. You worked hard. I appreciate it. It was a good decision to send her to Akasaka (In Tokyo) The pleasure district has changed. All the old customs are ending and the businesses are closing. We can't have our own live-in geisha now. Never mind that. Give her the paperwork. Yes, of course. Thank you. By the way, how did you end up coming here? Were you sold off by your husband? That's pretty much it. - Some husbands are terrible Here is the bond/contract. You should go to Tokyo and look after your mother. Your daughter is very good. She will become famous. I want to ask something. I don't want to leave it... About the baby? - It doesn't matter really but... Rumour says the baby was taken by a travelling actor from Shizuoka. You should forget it. It was only a week old and you hadn't even given the baby a name. Whether it died or has grown up... It's best to forget the whole thing. It's cruel to say but an oiran with a child is a bad thing. You have a lovely daughter. Concentrate on her. She's already on her way to Tokyo. You were still in bed with a customer. Tomoko had no time if she was going to catch the train but she came back. She called me to the entrance... The intermediary was pulling at her sleeve. I hurried out but her sleeve was ripped as he pulled it. I asked what had happened.... It made me cry. She just said "look after my mother". She ran and I heard she made it to the train in time. We look forward to doing business with you. (How pretty you look!) We're back! - Welcome back. Thank you! Come in and have a drink. OK. Thanks, everyone. Let's have the celebration dish! It's all thanks to you. - Congratulations Congratulations. Make sure you are properly grateful to the master. Please have a drink. We had a good reception. Everyone was amazed! Oh yes, you'd better go and show yourself to your mother. Go as you are are, she'll be delighted. - Yes, her daughter's spring dress. I'll just pop in then. She's so pretty! Just now, I looked up at the second storey and saw... There was a hot-looking woman watching us. Everybody noticed! Even a woman sees how sexy she is. She was smiling at Tomoko. Maria! Which party are you going to? - I'm just popping out for a bit. Afterwards why not come to the party. There'll be no fee but it'll be fun. - Yes do come and show your face. They will be delighted to see such a pretty new girl debut. (thanks but not accepting) Hi, it's me. Mother! What are you doing wearing that in daylight? Didn't you go? - They were curious about who you were! I wonder if they know? - Even if they don't it's too much! But why? - It's not for an amateur. I'll give you some money. Please buy a less showy kimono! Haven't you something more suitable for your age? - But I like the vivid colour. Plain ones doesn't suit me. - Even if not you must wear it. Think how I feel with you so showily dressed. What will people think of a mother who wears such showy kimono at her daughter's debut? I'm sorry. I'll be more careful in future. That's a beautiful kimono. You look good in it. The combination of colours is gorgeous. It's clearly Akasaka (high class). - Really? You're a big girl (one of the girls) now, Tomoko Nobody calls me that ("nee-san") though. On my way here just now they called to me saying "Maria-chan"... But you don't need to care about them teasing you! How do you know that? Miss Tanemaru at the Sugawara-house. What were you doing the Sugawa house? - I went to see you! Why? What for? Who needs a reason when you're mother and child. - Even between mother and child... I'm employed there. I'm not free. Isn't it enough that I come here to visit you? You leaning out in that outfit embarrasses me. What did you say to them? I'm sorry. - And you met with my boss, didn't you? What were you talking about? Nothing special. You know we're not connected to them now. Mother! What did you say! Something you can't tell me? What is it? Tell me! Was it something that you have to hide from me? What are you hiding? - I'm hiding nothing. I just got a little bit of pocket money from her. What? - Surely it's fine if it's just a little bit. No it's not. How much did you get? 20 yen. - That's quite a lot! You said "just a little bit"! - But she handed it to me and said it was OK... That 20 yen will come back on my 80 debt and make it 100. You took it so it's too late now. Don't ever do it again. Ask me if you need something. I'll sort it out. OK - Promise? - Yes Stop staring vacantly out into the street! It's unseemly. I'm bored. There's nothing to do. I said I'd give you spending money. You can go see a play or a moving picture. On my own? - How else? You don't come home until morning and you're booked at parties all evening. You don't understand how terrible the boredom is. I'm scolded if I go out, even if I put my head out the window! You tell me to go and see a play but that's no fun. It's like being imprisoned! I can't go back to working as an oiran. And I can't even wear what I want to! Mother... - You're the only person I can depend on. I'm trying to keep quiet for your sake. There's nothing for it but to hang myself. Don't say such a terrible, ill-omened thing and on such a happy day. But that's what I feel. I'm treated so badly by my own daughter! (drinking games being played) She's here. Sorry I'm late. - Come over here. Over here! This is Ko-botan from the house of Sugawaya, she's newly qualified. First Zashiki. She's beautiful. - It's a special day for Ko-botan, (Geisha name = little peony) Why not have it special for everyone? What's wrong with that? We are proud to be army school cadets. We are proud to be the leaders of the empire. Quite right! Listen everyone. Do up your collars, like soldiers! Even if you're paying, we'll drink hard! Can you pour me another? Nice to meet you. Here... Go for it Ezaki! Elite army officer meets beauty! He's almost as tanned as that movie star Hanpeita! Is your name Ezaki? Yes. - I'm Kobotan. What's wrong? - It's nothing. Are you crying? I suddenly felt lonely. Sleep until morning. - Excuse me, but I want to go home. Go home? - I know it's selfish of me, but yes. Just because you're qualified now doesn't entitle you to be selfish! And what's happened as a result? Fewer bookings. You left partway through the other night and came back. I had a cold. - And did you have a cold yesterday too? I wanted to go to my mother's and... - Liar! Your mother came here and was right here where you sit now! She came here? I offered her Hojicha but she said she prefers fine Shizuoka tea. I thought she was being rude but she actually likes bitter tea. Why was she here? She brought me ten yen. Ten yen is fine. You really shamed me and damaged my position. You've got a proper, high class patron. You're surely not having secret meetings with some shaven headed kid? Good evening. Sorry to be late. - Come in! Sorry. I haven't seen you for a while. (You're good at that) Have you been busy? - Surely I should ask you that! You had fun at the Yaokan-house with the army guys? No, I just went two or three times when I had free time. So did you have fun? - No I... It was just a bit of a laugh on Sunday with 4 or 5 of us. I heard the geisha were organizing it... - Well yes... Geisha sometimes want to use their own money and have fun. I want you to play with me too. - You're the rich man with a position. But... Don't get angry. I won't say badly of you It's fine for a fling but falling in love with a lower class woman means ruin. Have a drink. Excuse me. Kobotan, I know you've fallen in love, haven't you. You have your patron Konami, and we are rivals It's cruel but... Konami paid for your training and he loves you. Don't betray him Are you in a relationship with him? I have refused your request. I haven't even kissed him. He's quiet. The others went to their rooms (with the girls?). He just sat listening to me play the shamisen. And you're so in love after that? OK. OK. Tonight let's drink. I'll be there after I redo my make-up. Cheer up. Kobotan! You went off with those soldiers! It's fine for a geisha to have an affair. Our business relies on men and an affair makes us attractive / iroke. No one can teach you how to be sexy, that comes through having relationships. Meetings upstairs at the sweetshop with your favourite impoverished student is common enough. Much better than with Yakuza! It's a passing thing, like measles! Harumoto, you can play around with your army guy. But you can't. You're not someone who can do that. I've been watching you. You immediately fall deeply in love. That's a problem. NAME of INN Yaezaki! Oh Ezaki! Happy New Year! I have been wanting to see you. It's my first new year since graduation and I went to see family and then there was duty at the base. I have been busy with new year parties and I had to slip out. I'm sorry... - Please don't trouble yourself. I pretended to be going to a party and ran to mum's to change! This kimono is plain and doesn't stand out! I wondered why you were wearing that. You always wear plainer clothes when you meet me. Today I'm going to buy you a kimono. As a new year gift. But... I'll buy a cheap, plain one! Are you sure? - Yes, I get promoted in April and my pay rises. Then I will be delighted to let you buy me one. Let's eat quickly and go to a department store. I'm delighted. It's OK. Soldiers can't use umbrellas. - I see. Your actor (Hanpeita) will have to get wet! Hi, are you in? What have you done? Just tidying. How about my kimono? You haven't touched it have you? Let me see it. They're gone. Why? Who took it? Don't be silly. Bring it quickly. What about tonight's agreement? None of your business just shut up and get them out. Quick. I'm in a hurry. We'll talk later, just give me the kimono. There's no kimono here. If you won't take it out I'll get it myself. Get out of my way. Mother, where is it? - I don't know. You took then to the pawnshop. - I know nothing about that. You're the only one in this apartment. You must know. I don't know! Fine! If you lose things entrusted to you you'll have to pay compensation. Get off my kimono. Don't. I'm sorry to visit your lodgings. It's fine. Dressed like that nobody will know who you are. I wanted to wear that kimono you bought for me about this time... I couldn't. - Why not? My mother hid it! She's against us meeting. Everyone tries to interfere. I'm a geisha but this is not some affair I know. I'm serious too. Will you make me your wife? Not now, but sometime. Please. I can wait, if you say yes I can wait. I want to marry you. I'm thinking about how. But I have no money and no property. I still don't know if I can free you. Can you give up being a geisha? I can. I will work my fingers to the bone if I can be your wife. But I must not interfere with your rising in the world and society. I need to know your true feelings. My social success? I'm a soldier so that's it. But anyway that's less important than you. I'm so happy. Whatever happens I will get free. - I first meet you in September It's been two years. It's gone quickly. If happiness is waiting then I can wait, however many years it may be. If it's for you the hard times will go by quickly. I promise you. Falling in love with a geisha, no matter how elite a junior officer. Of course it will damage his prospects. You're 20 so you should understand that much. If you're going to fall for an officer at least go above the junior ranks. I have raised you to a level above him. If your patron finds out he'd be disappointed at your low choice. But he already knows. - He knows? I've been made a complete fool of. I'll tell the commander at base about Ezaki too (and put an end to it) Don't! - The commander will do what I want. If I tell him an elite officer cadet has fallen in love with a geisha who has a patron he'll know what to do. It's like a bad theatrical melodrama. If you care for Ezaki, end the relationship. I want your advice. - What about? Goze offered to build me a house and let me retire. He did? What did you say? - I refused. You really are a fool. That's a good offer. When I see him tonight I'm going to ask him... Whether he's still prepared to let me set up my own place. I'd like you to ask him for that as well. Look you... You refused because you didn't want to be his mistress. You don't want to be Goze's mistress because of Ezaki. I want to work. Rickshaw man arrives Nice moon! - The weather is better than business this time of year! Indeed so! It's arrived! Look! Isn't it pretty! - Stop it! In which country does a mother try on her daughter's new outfit! But it's pretty! - Think of your age! You'll be 40 next year! - I looked in the mirror. It suits me rather well! - Yes, you stay young for ever (sarcastic). I can still work as a prostitute! Alright I'll take it off! - I've got such a headache! I wonder what's caused that... - How dare you, you know perfectly well it's you! We live together but you really don't realise how much trouble I have. When this place was built two years ago I had to pay a lot of money to set up! Even after that initial payment I still have to pay charges. I'm struggling to feed the 4 girls... I get it! - Then be more helpful! What's the matter? Why are you crying? It's outrageous! - What is? The women at my classes were all saying that this place is just a low class brothel! They say we're just jumped up prostitutes. I run this place. It's 12. What do you want for lunch. There's left-over rice, eat it with pickled Kombu. And make sure you update the calendar! Have some water and calm down! It's September again... Mother!

Death of Emperor Taisho. Year one of the reign of Showa Emperor (Hirohito) We're home! - Welcome back. Thank you. Your mother's back. I'm home. - You took your time! It was fun. - Anyway sit at the kotatsu. And these? - Take them to my room. Put the heater in mother's room. I'm tired. How is Hachiran? He was pleased to see me. I said I loved mamushi... and he served it to me every night. Osaka is great! I went to the movies and the theatre! I saw Christmas decorations for the first time! Did he go with you? - Yes, he skipped off work. It must have caused trouble for him. You were there 10 days He said he wanted to do it. I didn't ask. Tomoko... I brought these for you. Hachiran bought me all these at Shinsaibashi (Osaka shopping district). Nice, aren't they? It's very flashy! Who could wear that! It's for me. Hachiran said it suited me! You got him to buy you all these? He said he wanted to so I think it's OK. And does his wife know? - Yes, I showed her. Return them! That's ridiculous. If I did that he'd be offended. I won't! You're really brassy! The family has adopted him as heir. Has it? The success of their business is down to his hard work. The wife is sickly. She was ill in bed almost all the time. Hachiran said having me there was like being reborn! It's a clockmaker so is Hachiran a repairer? Yes, he seems to have learned how to do that. Ah yes, I almost forgot... Hachiran gave me this. It's a pretty watch Such an expensive gift! - It's Swiss-made. Pure gold. I know you're supposed to put them on your wrist but it seems a waste. It's very nice. A high class gift. He's got 2 kids, hasn't he? - Yes, 2 boys. They're quite a handful. The older one starts elementary school next year. Hachiran went to Osaka the year grandmother died. That's 15 years ago. - He's become a good looking man. He actually wanted to come to Tokyo. Yes, he said so. He told you? He's in love with me you know. What are you talking about? - That's what he told me. You should act your age! But Hachiran told me... - Eugh, that's distasteful. Go to your own room please. - Tomoko... I have a photo of me with Hachiran when we went to Osaka Castle. I've heard enough. And stop talking in Osaka dialect now please. Hello, this is Hanaya. (name of her house of business) It's the madam of the Mikai house. What? No, I've heard nothing. Right, off we go then... Why are you looking like that? Who's the call from? Yes, I see. Thank you so much for telling me. Madam? Those customers from the Kaushin club are here. I'll go and see them in a moment. They booked for 2 people but there are actually 3 of them. Tell Seichan and get her to prepare another room. Mother... - What? Konami Goze has passed away! - When? Yesterday morning. - Yesterday? At the same time as our emperor! Lucky him. What a lovely 'posh' death day to choose. I didn't know! - Yes, and he's your patron! Nobody said anything! Even that servant he always brought with him to our meetings. He could at least have told me! That's what it's like when you're the mistress. The relationship ends when the patron dies. Get what you can while you can and then get out! That's the best way! Mother! - Well, I'm right, aren't I? You're not sad enough to cry though! How old was he? He must have been pretty old. 60 next birthday. - He'd lived a good long life then! Well it's not tragic to die at that age, is it? Why are you looking at me like that (critically)? You should be delighted he built you this huge Ryokan! The property is in your name and it's 600 tsubo (2,000 square metres) It was just after the earthquake so land was cheap! But now look at it! A huge place right in the middle of Tsukiji! You were lucky to have had such a good patron. All thanks to you selling me to the tea house in Shizuoka! You should thank me! O-kami-san! (Excuse me, Madam) Ezaki is here. - Which room is he in? In the Katsura (Judas Tree) room. Excuse me but... Why did pull a face? - Ezaki is... What did he do? - He's somehow different from usual... Welcome. It's unusual for you to come in daylight except on a Sunday. The girl never lays the charcoal correctly! Are you hungry? Do you want to eat? - No. What is it? Has something happened? What is it? Are you displeased with something? It's been 8 years since we met. - Yes. 8 years last September. What about it? I can't marry you. - Why not? - I can't tell you why. I don't want to. But why? You're tired of me, aren't you? This woman who runs a ryokan and doesn't look after her appearance. You think I'd say it just for that? - Well, tell me why. Have you met somebody else? Who else but you! Well have I done something? Count Konami, he plotted it Are you still going on about that! I worked in this tea house world so of course I had a patron. You already knew it. I'm sorry. I hadn't intended to say that. That's not something that can be said between us You've never said that. And you don't know how incredibly grateful I am. Anyway, that's in the past. Konami died yesterday. I just had a phone call and not from the family. There was no official notification for somebody like me. The madam at Mikawaya let me know. It's hard for me to say this at such a time but... Ezaki! When I visited your lodging you said... About whether or not I could stop being a geisha. When the earthquake destroyed our plans I said I would leave the geisha-world forever. I know. - So why can't you marry me? I thought I just had to wait until you graduated from the army university. I strove to wait, it's only next Spring. I would have given up this house then. And left your patron? - Of course. A geisha betting her life on love. Some patrons would even prepare a dowry and bridal goods for their mistress when she married. He would certainly have permitted me to have my wish. My family investigated your family records. I'm sorry the motive was just to gather the necessary paperwork. We already knew you were a Geisha. Country folk know that Geisha have patrons and are OK about it... I tried to fulfill my promise to you. Checking your origins and background was just a formality. I said other members of my class had married geisha too. Plenty of my sempai have done it. Some senior officers have adopted geisha into their families. Parents trust their children. We've been together for 6 years since our vow. And my parents had come to trust/believe in you. I... I believed that if I just abandoned the geisha life I could be your wife. And I tried so hard to... - I know! For 6 years... I didn't know this trap/ambush was waiting. I was careless. - What do you mean? I told you I don't want to say... I can't... I have my parents... But you have just your mother So it's my mother? Is that what this is about? I see. Parents and children think differently. We can't marry. To get my superior officer to agree I need your family's signed papers. And so you'll decline? I'm not saying that? But you are hesitating. There's something else you can't tell me, isn't there? I can guess, even though you won't say it. From Mr Nozawa? I'm leaving. - Wait! Yes, it's me. Wait, wait! Please excuse me but... I didn't know! The funeral is tomorrow at 2. Mr Nozawa I... I'm sorry but I'll call you back later. Ezaki! If I can't be your wife then so be it. I've walked a shady path although I intend to change that. I don't want to hear it. - I will not let that hope hinder you. Please Let's... - Stop it, you're making a spectacle! Please don't leave like this! We've cleared misunderstandings and don't need be hesitant or afraid what others think. We're finally free! Please, come back inside. Tomoko, thank you for everything. - Noooo! Idiot, there's nothing else to be done. I'd like to talk with Mr Nozawa. I'm so sorry about just now... (What's wrong? That was a bit strange.) I couldn't leave what I was in the middle of doing. (that's fair enough then.) What should I do about the funeral tomorrow? (I'll come and pick you up. Wait for me.) But will they let someone like me in to offer incense? (Of course, I'll tell them it was my idea.) Thank you. I'll be waiting for you. (Wear your hair in maru-mage style (married woman's hairstyle) I will. (You sound as if you're crying.) (Be strong! See you tomorrow.) (We've finished cleaning this room.) Mother! Shall I lay out the futon? The maids are still cleaning. Not yet. I want to finish this. That's the one that Hachiran bought for you. I want to wear it at the New Year. It will better in kimono. Will you really wear such a flashy pattern? You're always too plain! You should be more adventurous at New Year How about toasting some mochi? You're strange? - Why? You make me feel odd! - It's you who are odd! When you crawl home in the morning you speak fluent Osaka-ben Then after 2 or 3 days you go back to speaking Tokyo! - It's a skill! I've always been good at it. - Yes, you've been doing it a long time! It's hard to believe this woman was an oiran in Shizuoka. Perhaps. - When I was first brought to Tokyo... Your neck make up was so white... - Ah yes... The siren closest must be Hongan temple. - Yes. Where is the one that sounds far away? Is it ZoJoji temple in Shiga? You'll be 26 next year. Never mind my age, do you know yours? No, I've forgotten. - You're 43! Hachiran once told me I'm always so young. So I'll always be beautiful, that's what he said. You gave up being a geisha and are not doing anything that's worth much - Why do you say that? You'll just end up getting older... I won't be able to wear nice kimonos... I may not have the flashy kimono like geisha but... I'm very careful about what I wear. You're so dull! (huh?) It's so dull being old. You're quite blunt about it. People can't help getting older. But while you're alive it's best to do the less dull stuff! I've not become boring just because I've quit being a geisha. Really? - Yes, really! Even if Konami dies you'll still be in Akasaka. (Tokyo) You'd soon enough get yourself another man and... - Mother! You seem to be embarrassed about my past. I don't think it's shameful or embarrassing at all. When I was free to chose any man I wanted... I had everything and I was happy. It was much more fun there. I'm 43 tomorrow. I can't believe it. So depressing. I don't want to say it! Please tell me! But although my parents are a problem... It's because your mother was... Hello, anybody home? Welcome, I am the owner. I'm so grateful for your custom Have you forgotten me? Long time no see. It's good to see you again! Please pour me a drink. There you go. You can't beat a beer after a bath! - I am sorry I let the maid serve you rather than me. I heard you were running an inn. You've done well. - Thank you. Everyone's been successful in their careers. Have a drink. You've done best I think! (vendor calls 'apples') Have you heard anything of Ezaki? No, not a word. - He got married last spring. I think they have just had a child. I see. - Yes, that's right, it was a boy. I almost forgot because there are so many people getting married and having kids. Congratulations! Shall I get another bottle? - Yes please. Will you have dinner after? Yes - I'll bring it shortly. Hey, Kobotan. (her old geisha name) Yes? When did you and Ezaki become strangers? We were always strangers. - You never fooled me! It's true. I'm so busy running this place alone. If it was real I'd have had his kid. Mr Ozawa is here! - OK, bring a beer please. He says he's staying. - Oh! Can you get dinner prepared for the other guest. Excuse me. Welcome! Yes, please look after me! - You're staying tonight? Yes, for a month or so. - I'll be leaving. See you. - Goodbye. I hate this! - What's the matter? You have such a splendid house in Tokyo but you're here. There's a lot going on at the moment. It's better being here. It's horrible, these communists... I am close to (my place in) Shimbashi here, and I certainly won't get bored. Please go to Akasaka too. You're a very dutiful Madam. - It's my home! You're married to the business! - That's unkind. Especially to a woman who's never been married. I've brought the yukata. Well, how about it? How about having a patron again? No, I don't want to be owned any more. Did he put you off men for ever? No? Well what then? You'll probably laugh but... Next time I have a man he's going to have to marry me. Not even being able to officially go to a funeral... No matter how much I'm loved I end up utterly worn out. I've never been able to be proud in front of all the world. No matter how great the man's status I'm not being a mistress again. I see. I understand. I'm going to check the bath. I'll send the maid with dinner. There are so many of these rooms! It must have cost a lot! Tomoko! Koi-san, it's been a long time! There's no need to sit down here! It's Hachiran! - Long time no see! You're the only ones to call me Koi-san. - I'd forgotten! This room's free, please come in. Make yourself comfortable. Bring three teas please. And then go to Mr Nodaya. I last saw you in December two years ago, thanks for taking care of mother. It's a surprise. If you'd written I could have come and met you. I heard that your wife passed away. You must have been sad. - Well it's been more than a year (last spring). You can take it easy and have fun. - Mum, that's not the right thing to say I did as she suggested in her letters and I'm sightseeing in Tokyo. Oh... I see. Well, you were lonely after your wife died, weren't you... Well, we're an inn and we have plenty of rooms. It's nothing special but please stay here. Thank you so much - You've got two kids? - Yes, thank you so much for asking. Fool! (she calls his name) I don't mind - But it's bit... Don't you want to? - No, no it's not that I don't want to... I've never been able to forget you. When you got married again I bit the pillow and cried so many times. Never mind long ago. What about now? I haven't forgotten that feeling so I rushed here as soon as I got your letter (leaving the business), Will you take me to Osaka with you? How could I possibly do that? That's too much! I'm not worthy of it. My wife's dead and I'm a widower now. Someone I've had feelings for since I was young is back in my life. I'm telling you it's OK. Ito-san I... Don't you want me? So will you marry me? - You're a bit pushy... If you don't mind Koi-san I... I'd like to hold the ceremony quickly. Hachiran! Do you know how old she is? - Well I... errr Go on then, tell me. - Tomoko! It's embarrassing... - Go on, tell me! She's 7 years older than me. She's 47. I don't know why you agreed and I think you should reconsider. Go back to Osaka. Why are you so opposed? Hachiran and I are not children, we discussed it before we decided. I'm your mother! Are you serious? - What about? Marrying Hachiran! - I'm not joking! You're crazy. Getting married at 47! No matter if there's history it's as if you'll have any bloke who'll have you. It's embarrassing. It's not having "some bloke", we're getting married! How many marriages will it take to satisfy you? I've been unable to marry because of having you as my mother. What are you talking about? Although she's the one you knew when you were young she's not the girl who went off to get married, she's had two children apart from me. You know that? Yasuko at the Landowner-family. And she had one in Shizuoka, I don't know whose it was. The witch dropped it in the sea, current whereabouts unknown. Tomoko! - Hachiran... You probably didn't know she was in a brothel in Shizuoka. She worked as a prostitute for 4 years. I remember it very well as I had already been sold to the same brothel before you arrived in it! She was proud to be top at the previous place! Why are you saying this? If you're OK with that then I don't mind! You're a clockmaker's heir and the relatives will be against this. If a former prostitute 7 years older than you is OK for your second wife... You'd better think about your kids' education! I was a prostitute. You were a geisha. - A geisha and a prostitute are different. I was a prostitute, you were a mistress. Hachiran, she talks so proudly. You're just a mistress! A mistress! Mother, I wanted to marry him I tried so many times... Being a geisha was acceptable but not being the daughter of a whore! I became Konami's mistress and tried to give up being a geisha. I had only myself to depend on and I had to build a future. But being a geisha, becoming a mistress... Everything's been your fault from the very beginning! If you'd stayed in my father's house after he died, none of this would have happened to me. You've married many times, I never could! You took all those chances to get married, and left none for me! I've never known that ordinary happiness. Holding a wedding ceremony... I've never had that. So many marriages! So many times a bride. Tomoko, you're jealous, aren't you. Mother! - You're such an uncaring daughter! Hachiran, let's leave. Who can stay in such a place. I'll pack. Let's go to Atami hot springs on the way back. How about going on from Kyoto and Nara to meet your mother? No way! I don't think of her as my mother - Don't say that. Not acting her age is human nature, that's what I'm doing too! Tomoko... You probably won't like me to ask again... But I have to as it's been preying on my mind. You blaming your mother for not acting her age... And me, at this age... I'm not sure whether you'll regret agreeing to come with me, you're not a professional! We've had a relationship of 12 years, As you've noticed I have been in love with you for a long time. You might not have noticed but I am. You told me very clearly... You didn't want a man who wouldn't marry you... Especially one with a wife and children. So why are you here with me? My wife supported me through long years of poverty... I can't break up with her because I've found someone else. She may not be the perfect wife but... But I'm the kind of man who can't do that. I know. Do you? I'm so grateful for all that you've given me. But a mistress is just a mistress... As my mother has so painfully reminded me. And I can get by alone, but I'm a woman... There are sad times when I want to cling to someone. I don't have anything but... With you I can cry on your lap. Tomoko! I wonder what happened to Hachiran. He knows Tokyo was badly burned but he's not got in contact. Not even when we heard the war was lost. I wonder why. Nobody has time to worry about you. I know Osaka has been badly bombed. But since I left and came here not a single word... But I wonder... - How many times must we go over it Even Hachiran can't do that. No, that's crazy. Of course he... Why doesn't he come and get me? Why don't you just go back to Osaka? I've told you many times. It's no fun there. We've been at war, there's not been anywhere in Japan that's fun! He always came home tired out... I had to cook for him. - Of course you did! There's no food, how could I cook? From Osaka you can get out to Wakayama and buy stuff. I go out with a rucksack too. I'm 61! But you can't just leave and then go back. It was you who decided to marry him! Don't be mean to me! I'm an old woman! Osaka's dangerous. - Why? You know very well I've been a widow for a while... Hurry up and finish. Tomoko... - What? When I die I want you to bury me with your father. What? I want to be buried with him. - Why? It's my right. You're now wife of Hachiro (Hachiran) Kuwata, you married him! You'll be buried with him. You can't go back in time. But Seikichi Tada is your father. He may be my father but he's nothing to do with you. You go on about being with him when you die but you've given yourself to a lot men since! You're like a spoiled kid. Don't you feel bad for Hachiran? You don't understand... - No, I don't. It's weird. I'll buy you a ticket. How about going back to Osaka? You're cruel! You're the only one I can rely on in these hard times. Don't be so cold. I'm your mother. Tomoko... Don't you think it's strange? He'd surely come here for me. Even though Hanaya burned down. That's 5, 6... 9 It's almost 6 months! They said Japan had never been defeated nor would it be... but we lost. It's not surprising that communications between Osaka and Tokyo are cut off. But the fighting's over now... It's been more than a month! If you're so worried why not go and see. He won't mind. I don't love him. I just wonder if he's still alive. I wonder if he's dead. What do you think? You don't love him so why not shut up! It was about this time when Nozawa died. That was the second time I walked out. It was September. It was eight years ago today. Really? Today? I've always hated September. You've not had a man for a long time either. You must be lonely. Mother! Why get angry? - I'm not like you! Is Nakano next? - No, the one after. I'm getting off there. (Tatsuo Yamano) Anybody home? Is anyone there? There you are! How are you? Yes. You're pregnant? - Yes. Congratulations! It's a good thing this place wasn't bombed. Is he here? - No, he's out. Can I wait for him? - Please come in. It's hot so I don't need a cushion. I saw the shoes and thought some Americans were here. They're all my husband's shoes. He changes every time he comes home. - He's doing well! If your door's unlocked they'll get stolen. - It's hot, we need it open. What does your husband do now? I don't really know. Yasuko, mother has been with me all the time. Oh. No one came from Osaka for her, then the Hanaya burned down, then the war ended. We've been living in our old air-raid shelter. Thank you. Here you are. - Thanks. I put sugar in. You have nice expensive things, I haven't had this kind of tea for years It smells great. - It's Lipton. Have as many cups as you want. - You've got lots of sugar too, then? My husband brings it for me. I envy you. I can't stay in that shelter for ever. I need to get a business up and running. I came to ask you a favour. Could you look after mother until I get sorted out? She is your only parent. I don't have money like I used to but I'll pay. I'm not asking you to do it for ever. I'll come and get her as soon as I get a roof over our heads. Please look after her until then. Is it OK to send her back to Osaka? We can't trouble Hachiran any further. After all she left without discussing it with him. She's never behaved like a proper wife. She's never once done anything motherly for me. It's the same for me. But she is our mother. We can't leave a woman in her 60s living in an air-raid shelter. It's OK now but when it's cold and wet it will be miserable. It serves her right. When father died in Wakayama there was no protection... I was bullied by the legitimate kids, So I ran away. I know you've suffered a lot. And when I ran away to Osaka... I'll never forget mother's face and her saying to me "what the hell do you want?" Is that what she should have said to her crying daughter? So what are you telling me to do? She may not be very maternal but she is still our mother. It probably does serve her right. But she's a blood relative and we can't abandon her. I know you're not going to be filial and look after her. So take her just for a year at most. I will pay for her board. Is that OK? Surely you can't object to that? Even if it were a stranger and not your own mother... when someone begs like this... I think you're obliged to drop your objections. Well? I'll have to ask my husband. You should be able to know without asking him. He has obligations to us. I paid for this house. When you turned up at our door, rejected and miserable, did I object? Before being sent off to Shizuoka I thought that that crying baby had grown so much. It was a long time since I'd cried. Hello? - He's back. Hi Sis. Long time no see. - Yes, it's been a while. Where are you living now? I drove through that area by the river, it's been pretty badly devastated. Well you seem to be doing OK at least? Maybe so. Get me some beer. The cans. She wants us to take in my mother. Eh? Your mother? - I said I don't want to. That parent and sibling thing is old fashioned these days. Thank of this new 'democracy' word! Leave her to sort herself out. It's the age of individualism, you, me and Yasuko are all individuals. Individuals should look after their own happiness and their own rights. And as for mother... - Fine! I've heard enough. Mother? I'm back. Tomoko, where have you been? Sorry I'm late. - I was really scared. I thought you'd abandoned me and gone off. It's OK, mum. I won't abandon you. I'm your only daughter. We'll manage together. I'll show them! I'll build a fine house on this land Until then... it will be tough on you but... It'll be tough on the two of us together. OK. In this whole world it's only you I can rely on, Tomoko. I can put up with it and be patient. Where did you find this? In the remains of the kitchen. I turned over the crockery box and there were 3 unbroken ones. I didn't need them so I hadn't looked but... All the crockery in the cellar should be safe. Right mum, we're going to open a restaurant, even if it's a black market one! We've got 40 sets of crockery! That's so rare these days! When food is scarce there's value in crockery! Everything will be fine. I can make things good for you mum, you just need to be patient. We must work hard (just like we always used to say!) That's right! Brilliant! Tomoko! - What? Isn't that him? It is him! Idiot! What are you doing over there? We're here! - Hachiran! Koi-san! You're safe! You're OK! Safe but... These are pretty tough living conditions. I was so patiently waiting for you to come for me. Koi-san, and you're OK? Mother has been waiting. I'm sorry, I wrote but obviously nothing reached you. Never mind a letter... - I'm sorry. How are things at your place? Well, thankfully we were not burned out. Come back with me! We won't have the lifestyle we had before the war. It's taken you so long... - I'm sorry! Koi-san too, why not come to Osaka until Tokyo gets sorted out. It's not the nicest place! - I'll be OK. Mum, you go home. I'll do this myself. Hachiran, I can't put you up in our bomb shelter. How about heading straight back today? I will, if you're really OK with that. Yes, let's! It's horrible living in a hole in the ground! Come here. Mum! When you die you should rest in Hachiran's grave. He's a good husband. This place is a bit like a grave already so we'll enter it together now!

I saw it in this morning's paper and came straight away. Is he still alive? He won't be executed straight away. MacArthur has to give final approval. Recently it's taken up to a year. Did he really behead the American airmen from the B52? I don't know. It's hard to imagine the commander himself doing it. But I guess he takes responsibility for what his troops did. I'm sorry. The death penalty for something that he didn't do is terrible. Can't we do anything? - No, nothing. It's all done far off and we cannot do a thing about it. At least let me meet with him please. What is your relationship to Colonel Ezaki? I'm an old... acquaintance. Visiting is only permitted once a month. The first time is family only. Maximum of 5 people. Just once? - Yes, that's right. He has a wife and three children. His father always comes. That's the maximum five people. Please help me to meet him, I must meet him. But just a friend... - I'm an old... someone who spent time with him long ago I can't say anything more than that. Please! I'll give you the family address. The son is a student and lives in Tokyo but the wife and other kids are still in Akita where they were evacuated. Or shall I give the family your contact details when they next come? No, what's not... Then if there's any space in the permitted 5 visitors... I will add you in as a family member. I'll be in touch. Thank you so much. You name and address? - Tomoko Sunaga The kanji are 須 (su) and 永 (naga) - as used in the word 永久 (eternal) Tomoko is written with two moons 朋子 - here's my card My business is called Hanaya. I understand how you may feel but... But we can't break the rule of a maximum of 5 visitors per month. It's not fair to give you false hope. And unless one of the five people gets sick or something... All you can do is wait. - It's been 6 months! He's been sentenced and it could be carried out any time. Just being made to wait is cruel. All I want to do is meet him. Not to do anything bad. As soon as there's a chance I will contact you. Mr Murata... Every time I've come these 6 months that's all you've ever been able to say to me! It's the only thing I can say. Good morning. Welcome back. - Hi. Welcome home. - Hi. Your mother's here from Osaka. - My mother? She's only just arrived. Is that you, Tomoko? Hi, mum. What brought you here so suddenly? - What lovely flowers in the garden. Lots of red flowers. I'm not sure if it's flowers or the berries. It's waremokou (burnet). Ah, the flower that signifies one-sided love... I had it as a design on my kimono and sash when I worked in 2-cho-me (red-light district). There were young geisha who had one-sided crushes. You're clever, Tomoko. You know (what it means). I've not seen you for 3 years. Look how magnificent they (it!) has become. Thank you for the nice food. I was delighted. Did you like it? - Yes, I realised how much we share as blood relatives... I so wanted to come to Tokyo. But Hachiran kept saying it was not a good idea. I said I'd just come and see how you were doing. I tricked him! Tricked him? - Well, I never liked him much! He can't compare to my lovely daughter! Tomoko, let's live together again like we used to do. So you're telling me you've left Hachiran? Yes. - But I suppose he thinks that you'll come back... He said he'd come and collect me but I said no and left. What the hell does that mean? I'm fed up living with strangers. The stranger is your husband. How can a married couple be 'strangers'? We've been total strangers to each other for a while (no sex). That's not what being a couple is about. - Oh yes it is! You're the only one with whom I have an intimate connection. And Yasuko? I'm not your only daughter! She's your father's kid. - She's also definitely yours! She's not Seikichi's. I've cut all ties to him. What did you just say? I've already told you. I want to be buried with your father when I die. You and I are parent and child but Yasuko is a stranger. That's what I think. - What kind of logic is that? So what are Yasuko and me? When Yasuko was in trouble she always came to me saying I was the only one she could rely on. She runs off with that ex-driver and now they're rich she doesn't even send a letter... She's the one who's got your blood. Before she ran off with Yamano, she was pregnant by some other bloke. If the child had lived, it would have been a brothel child like yours! And me never being able to marry or have children... Tomoko, we've not seen each other for 3 years. Don't be so WAREMOKOU (Burnet flower = one sided love?) What the hell does that mean? You're so angry with me I got confused, I didn't know what I was saying! Can I have more tea? - Pour it yourself! Madam! There's a phone call... - Who from? - The Fukuinkyoku (who handle ex-military issues). He said you must phone immediately. THE TWO KANJI HERE 賽報 housai mean give thanks for a prayer answered Is that Demobilisation and former military affairs? Can I speak to Mr Murata please? Yes, in the legal section... Yes, that's him. Is that Tomoko Sunaga? There's a space in the visitor list. Please come immediately! The truck leaves in less than 30 minutes. OK, get here however you can. Hello? He will find out sooner or later, why hide it? He'll read it in your face. It was grandfather's last wish to tell him... - No, you mustn't. You may be able to fake it once, but not a second time. I don't want to see his face when he hears. I would cry. Would the family of Colonel Fumitake Eizaki please come with me. This way. Father! I'm glad to see you. Dad, are you well? Thank you for taking the trouble to bring them every month. What's happened to father? He's rather tired so he said he's resting. Is he ill? - No. No, but taking the train to Tokyo is hard for him. He's had a cold and I didn't want him to develop complications. I told him not to come. I see. My name is Sunaga. It's been a long time. I'm from Hanaya in Tsukiji. It's me, Tomoko. It's so good to see you. I'm glad that you're looking well. Seiji, Yuji, are you both studying hard? Excuse me everyone. I'll leave now. Is that really enough? Yes, thank you. - Did you manage to talk? Thank you (implies yes). - I'm so glad of that. You're something out of the ordinary... You contacted me every ten days or so You really worked so hard! Welcome back. Welcome... What's wrong? I'm fine, just a little nauseous. Welcome back. Hachiran's here and he's clearly happy to see me. You need some medicine. Hachiran, how old are you next birthday? You're better here than at that pathetic watchmaker! What's wrong? - Long time no see, Koi-san. Your mother summoned me and I... Your business seems to be doing extremely well. Get out! I want you both to go back to Osaka. - Tomoko... Now this minute! No, get out. I can't bear It. I... Tomoko! - Koi-san! Tojo and 6 other war criminals hanged this morning at 00:15 hrs No, it was not him. Don't worry. As for visiting hours... This month there were 5 family members. And I think next month will be no good either. Even if I don't see him again... I'm just so glad he's alive and well. All I can do is pray. It's so kind of you to call so many times. I wish you a Happy New Year. Good bye. (Shows she has been making lots of prayer offerings) We're home. - Welcome back. We're back! I'm worn out! You shouldn't have opened the screens when it's so cold. I feel better like this. The Mitsumata (Oriental Paper Bush) is in flower. Spring is on the way. It's still February. I'm shutting the window. It's certainly not spring yet. You must rest. Otherwise you'll get worse. Ginza's looking lively! Some really nice-looking guys! I was quite taken with him! Good strong nose and a nice shaped mouth... I liked his grey eyes. Who are you talking about? - An American soldier. I don't want to hear about such trifles. Go away and let me rest. It's different from when I had my own room. Since we closed the business I can't get him to stay... I've got no place of my own. You've got a house in Osaka. Go back there. I never want to go there again. I can't live with her, she's not my blood relation. I asked you to leave me to sleep in peace. But I wonder... - Wonder about what? I'm over fifty now... Although everyone says I look young. What are you on about? - My period. Your periods stopped very early. For me giving birth was easy and so was menopause. I wonder why you're different. It's because I'm not your kid. I don't look like you. Neither my body nor my personality are like yours. But sometimes... You do look very like your father, Sekiichi. Parent and child often do resemble each other. Seikichi was a really good looking man. Oh yes, I've just remembered They always used to say when the Hanamitsu flowered you'd meet your love. It's a flower of good omen. You know a lot about the meaning of flowers. It bloomed in Seikichi's garden. It was a beautiful garden. Sadly Osaka has changed a lot now. Please come in. - We have visitors. (Come in, it's been a while) I've brought some important customers. Mrs Ito? - Thank you. Excuse me! - What is it? Special delivery for Koi-san. - Who from? Koi-san, how are you... - It's cold! What's in the letter? - I'm just going out. What is it? - Help me get ready. Where are you going? Hachiran! Bring the wheelchair, quickly! Mr Murata! - Ah, Ms Sunaga! Please excuse me for a moment. It took place on the 13th. Just before dawn on the 13th. We heard last night... the 15th. I was going to phone you straight away but... But it's hard for me to tell you over the phone. I see. The 13th... - I'm so sorry to have to tell you. What about the funeral? When someone has been executed... the body is not handed over to the family. The 8th Army deals with the remains. We have no idea what happens. No idea at all - But Buddhist offerings...! I don't know where they are. We don't know the place. Not being able to get the remains is terrible. We think so too. It's terrible that the whereabouts of the remains is unknown. Information about the day of an execution never leaks in advance. Is he really dead? I'm afraid that much is certain. You certainly have a lot of those! I'm impressed. I've never prayed at a shrine. And you've never done hakamairi (grave visits), - True enough! Where are my father's remains? Your father's what? His remains? In the grave at Tada, of course. In Wakayama? - Yes. Why are you suddenly asking about it? Have you never thought you wanted them? I told you... I want to be put in with your dad when I die. I've asked you to do that. I wonder what will happen when I die... You're a Sunaga. Even if they've adopted it will be their grave. An heir? How old do you think I am? 46 or 45? - 48. A woman's best years are still ahead of you. You're the mistress of this busy Hanaya. You'll have your choice of men. You won't be carrying some dirty little guy like Hachiran around in your life. I'm worn out. I'll just have a quick cigarette. Why did you do that? Go back to Hachiran! Firstly I don't want you to take this the wrong way. Fine, now tell me the reason clearly. This Nyorai (Buddah of healing)... Where's it from? - The family of a member of the aristocracy who we know. If you're angry about it I will leave. How much? - To anyone else it would be 2 million yen. But I feel if it's you I shouldn't make any profit. Leave it there. - Thank you very much. That's a great relief. This is just right to bring relief. I don't want a new, flashy altar. I'm going to put the funeral tablets next to the statue of Amida Buddah. I want enough space on the altar for lots of offerings. How big are the funeral tablets? I haven't got any yet... Can you order them for me? - Yes, if you tell me the posthumous names. I don't know them! Just a moment. I want to know Father's posthumous name. His kaimyo! I'm having an altar and I want his tablet enshrined. Hmmm... Can't you remember? Errr... You don't know the kaimyo of the man you want to be buried with? I know that I did know it. But it was a very long time ago. This is for you. Isn't it nice, you'll be warm when you wear it. You've never visited his grave or prayed at the shrine have you. Well it's a long way... You don't even know the kaimyo of your first husband! That's a failure as wife and as a woman. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Not knowing my father's name... You always say that we're bound by blood ties... and you don't know the kaimyo... And you think you'll be allowed to be buried with him... you're shameless... Let me tell you one thing... Do you know the kaimyo of your first patron? There was no "first", there's only ever been one. And that one, that Amida... The Konami funeral was not at a temple so there is no kaimyo. And what about your number two guy, Nozawa? What's his? - I don't know! Yes, he was your lover... And actually you had another lover, didn't you? The one who was hung 4 years ago. - I don't know who you mean. You're the one who's been married 3 times, not me. Nokoze Konami, then Soichi Nozawa, then... What was his name again... Ezaki! That's three! The same as me! I've suffered. I've not had a formalised relationship in my whole life. The only relationship I can't seem to sever is with you. Why think of death on such a glorious day! Who the hell is going to be commemorated at it? What a waste! We don't need that altar yet, we're not dying! Here's the information so you can make the memorial tablets. I just can't get used to these unfamiliar posthumous names. Tsuda Sunaga, Seikichi Tazawa... Eiko, or do you read it Hidekimi? With family name Konami. Soichi Nozawa, Fumitake Ezawa. I'll get them done as soon as possible. - Madam? Yes, what is it? The owner of Okamotoro (tea house) in Wakayama is here. I'll leave the measurements up to you but I want them to be grand. Of course. I will see to it. May I come in? - Please do. Long time no see. - Nice to see you. It must be two years ago we met last. - It was summer. That's right. It was, but sadly it rained and rained. I'm glad to see you looking well. - Thank you. It's very much thanks to you. - Not at all. I have been looking forward to coming to see you while I am in Tokyo. It changes so much every time I come! I see you've extended the building! - Yes, a big function room and baths. I got your maid to show me a little bit. It's very impressive. Well... That red colour is quite daring. - Yes, I wanted to make it special. I like those angled roofs. Can you show me around properly? I'll just have a sip of tea first. Madam? What's the matter? Help! Somebody! Help! The mistress has collapsed! Is that you, Hachiran? Yes. - (hears new year bells) so another year has passed! Yes. How old will you be this year? 63. And mother is 7 years older, so she'll be 70 (lucky age) hmmm She still looks young but she's quite old now. Although it's just a bad cold that put me in hospital. She should have come to visit at least once. She's got back pain. It's pretty bad when mum and daughter are both sick at the same time. We must be very closely linked. So in the end I never had a child. And after the operation I never will. It's a lonely household. Speaking of which, after the operation... I remember seeing a little boy. Who brought him? Your sister Yasuko rushed to the hospital. So he's Yashiko's boy? She did tell me. She's actually been staying at your place ever since. Really? Why is she at my place? It seems things are not going well with her husband. And so she came to us? That's a bit cheeky! What does she do when she meets mother? They've never got on and there's no way they could live in the same house. Hachiran... Mother didn't come to see me even once. What kind of parent wouldn't visit a daughter in hospital. Yes but she... she... She's dead, isn't she? Oh Koi-san (Tomoko's pet name)... I'm right, aren't I. Why didn't you tell me? How did she die? She was hurrying to the hospital... She was run over by a jeep. You were still on the operating table. She received an urgent call from the hospital. She didn't call a taxi. The hospital is so close by that she just dashed out and ran towards it... She died instantly. The Madam is back home. Madam is here! Welcome back! We're so pleased to see you back and out of hospital. Thank you. And thanks for all your hard work in my absence. You've run the place for a whole month in my absence. I am so grateful. I thank you all. - There will be a gift to show Madam's appreciation. Here, this is for you, our chef. It's just a small something. Thank you so much. It's very kind of you. 3 Memorial tablets: Noza (left), Sunaga (right) and her mother Ikuyo (centre) Mother... You obviously... You closed up the financial accounts beautifully and died. Oh mother! And your life is closed now too. Excuse me. I should have been with her! Please forgive me. Oh, Hachiran... It's no fault of yours that she died. It was just that her time had come. And she was a selfish and inconsiderate mother... right up until the end. I've been waiting for you to come out of hospital. I'm so grateful for your kindness all this time. But I'd like to go back to Osaka. I have been planning to tell you. What? I always call you Hachiran without any polite suffix (like san)... You're my mother's husband... and that makes you my father. You can stay in this house as long as you like. I don't intend to keep making you be the shoe-boy! I'm really grateful. But I have a house and children in Osaka and I must go home. Your mother didn't like the house in Osaka. So she cheekily came to your place. And I am registered as a member of the Kuwata family. Since your mother has now passed away... There's no reason for me to be here. I'd like to take her ashes and go home. Her ashes? Yes, I planned this so I have divided the ashes. She always told me that when she died... I could only have half of the ashes. Did she say that? She insisted that half belonged to you. So right up until the very end... She was always selfish, especially to you. But I'm satisfied. My youthful dream came true. She became my wife. To leave so soon after you come out of hospital is ungrateful of me. But my son wants me to come home. Please can I take half of her ashes? And you have been a true friend. Take care of yourself. I wish you a long life. Thank you. I will go and pack. The Mitsumata (oriental paper bush) is in flower! It's a flower that brings back many memories. Are you better now? Yes. - That's good. What's your name? - Jouji Yamano. Jouji? (George) It's a bit like an American name! - You write it like Tsuneharu (常治）but pronounce it Jouji (George) Tsuneharu is better. Can you bring me some of those flowers? Like this? - And one more! Thank you. Hachiran says he's going back to Osaka. So who will I sleep with? Don't you sleep with your mother? - No, she goes to bed late. I always sleep with Hachiran. I don't want to be on my own. Give me your hand. Mine are quite cracked! Yours are very soft! - So who will sleep with me? I will! - Huh?? No need to be so surprised. I'm your aunt. I'll just go and tell mum. Then I'll come back. Oh, mother! The mitsumata flowers are in bloom. I hope you meet Seikichi again in the afterlife somewhere. One day I will put your ashes in with his. "Sleep baby sleep" "If you don't stop crying you will be spirited away (kamikakushi)" "If you sleep then your mother will stay with you!" Wakayama 1954 You bringing the ashes here is a problem. Mother always said she wanted her ashes buried with his. And I also wanted to come and visit my father's grave. Seikichi Tazawa... He is registered here and I can't deny it. But his ashes are enshrined in the Tazawa family altar. There is no individual grave for him. And your mother left. And someone who isn't part of the family saying they want to be buried here is... It's just not logical. You've never visited here in all these long years... Saying it's your father's grave as if I should just say "yes of course..." Take these with you. There's no reason for us to take them. That was so insulting! After we came all the way from Tokyo to visit the grave! They wouldn't even let me visit his grave! I'm so angry! I just prayed in front of the ashes. I don't have a grave to rest in either so... I told her that wherever I end up being buried... She will just have to accept being buried with me. Quite right. Until then she has to wait patiently on the altar. Your son is quite grown up now. Now he's a university student. He's always studying! I'm envious. Yours finished University a while ago. It's not like that. You and I are so similar in so many ways. I adopted and brought up my younger brother's son. And... An adopted child is just not the same. I worked so hard to bring him up. I thought he was mine, I thought he was my life! But he put me through hell. He came back from university with some woman. Saying that I should retire and that they would run the place. I was so shocked I almost fainted. if I said I don't like the woman and that I am not going to retire... He said nothing and returned to Tokyo and keeps asking for his monthly allowance as usual. It's pitiful I know but I send the money. He thinks that when I die the place will be his. He's just waiting for that. I was so depressed. So them I put him back in my brother's family register. Then he immediately came to apologise! Saying that he would do whatever I wanted. They wanted my business so he said sorry, but I kicked him out. That's all. Can I use your phone? - I'll put the call through for you. Who to? My house. Place a call to Hanaya in Tokyo. Is that the operator? - Yes, they'll try to connect us. Something urgent? I suddenly wanted to hear my boy's voice. I'm envious. It's not the same as if it's your own child. My Tsune is not adopted. My adopted kid was a horror, but your kid is different. Let's hope so. Here it is. Yes? Oh, please try again later. The line is engaged. - Thanks for trying. Listen Sis... Look at those waves. Those are the waves that make Wakanoura famous. (e.g. Manyoshu poem 919) The waves come in one after another but are not thrown back. It's quite a mysterious phenomenon. No ebb back from the incoming waves? Come and have a look. THE END
