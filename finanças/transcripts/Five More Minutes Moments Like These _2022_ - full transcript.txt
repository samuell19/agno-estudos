How does Santa eat all the cookies that kids leave out for him? Magic! I don't think he'd mind if we helped him a little bit, though. Hey! It's time for bed, Adam. But we need to put the carrots out for the reindeer. That's right. Carrots are packed with Vitamin A, and you need that for good vision. Well, then you'd better get them these STAT! - Oh, ho, ho... - Thanks, Mom! You know, Santa might miss our house if you don't get to bed soon. Five more minutes? Yeah, five more minutes? All right, but only if I can get an Adam sandwich. Deal. Come here! Ooh, tighter, tighter, tighter, tighter, tighter! Can we ride on the trolley again tomorrow? Absolutely. And we're going caroling. With hot chocolate? I think hot chocolate while caroling is a must. Yeah, it keeps the vocal cords relaxed. Oh, yeah, I've read that. Marshmallows help with that, too. We love you, bud. Sleep well. Night, buddy. Love you, Adam. Love you, too. Ah... Are you okay, Brian? Yeah, just a headache. I'll be fine. What do you think? I think it's the best bike in the whole world. Right? Yeah. Now... it's time for our annual celebration. ♪ The fire's glowing... ♪ I thought you forgot. Forget our first Christmas together? Me? Never! We got snowed in... Yeah, but I kept you warm. And I knew I never wanted to spend another Christmas without you. And every Christmas since, it's been you, me, and chestnuts roasting on... The bell! The bell? I forgot the bell for Adam's bike. Uh, there's a store just down the street. Oh, no, you don't have to do that. We can just get it after Christmas. No, the bell's the most important part of the bike. More important than the wheels? Equally as important, yeah. When I was his age, I had a green bike, and the bell was the best part of the bike. I told Adam all about it. His face just lit up. You should have seen him, Kaitlyn. Seems like a clever way to get out of helping me clean up. It'll only take me five minutes, and then, I promise you, I will be back to finish our dance. Have I mentioned how much I love you? Get outta here. - All right. - Go! ♪ Magic is falling straight from the sky ♪ ♪ Covering everything glistening white ♪ ♪ Jack Frost has finally come out to say hi ♪ ♪ With his snow on Christmas morning ♪ There we go. Great! Oh, that's great. Whoo-hoo! Fabulous. I can't believe the client called us back for last-minute re-shoots. Who does that three weeks before Christmas? It's okay. I'll have the proofs to you by the end of the day tomorrow. Kaitlyn, you're the best. Thank you. Jenny, I haven't been excited about a project like this in years. Thank you for inviting me to be a part of it. Come in-house. Let us hire you full-time. I love you, my boss loves you, the clients love you... Any chance you'd move the company to L.A.? No, London is calling. I wish I could. What is keeping you in L.A.? A man perhaps? Yes. My son. He's already had his life uprooted once. But uprooting can be good? We have amazing schools in London, and you could travel around Europe together, and your son could learn proper football, not the American kind. I mean, I have to be honest, it sounds amazing. So you'll think about it this time? I promise I will. All right, let's get a line-up. One more time. Here we go... Miss Morrison? Yeah? Oh, hi, Miss Polly. I wanted to see if we could pick a time to set up a parent-teacher conference after the break. Is everything okay? We all adore Adam. We just want to talk about his social and emotional goals. What does that mean? Adam's not entirely comfortable participating in class discussions or group projects. He's a little shy. He is, but I'm worried it's extending outside the classroom. At recess, he'd rather be alone, or skip it altogether. And you're concerned? We just take a holistic approach to education, and sometimes, when faced with the loss of a parent, children can turn inward. Well, I appreciate you bringing this up with me. Yes, let's... Let's definitely meet. Great. I'll email you some dates, and please try not to worry. It's just a meeting. Thank you. Have a nice holiday. You, too. Thank you. Hey, what do you want for dinner tonight? Anything is fine. Well, I was thinking about making spaghetti? Okay. Hey, Adam, is everything okay at school? Yeah. Hey, if you ever wanna talk about anything at all, I'm here. Okay. I think I'm gonna go start dinner. Cool. Cool. Hey, bud, let's put that away and wash up, please. Aw... Hey there. How's my favorite sister-in-law? I'm fabulous. Colorado is the perfect combination of cold and festive. That sounds lovely. You okay? Not really. What's going on? Adam's teacher says that he's struggling in school. He's having trouble connecting with other kids. She thinks it might be everything related to Brian. Oh, you two are really close. I'm sure if he was struggling, he would tell you about it. Yeah, I thought he would, but now I don't know. You know what? Maybe you two need to re-connect with a holiday trip? Maddy... I'm serious. Have you given any more thought to spending Christmas here? Your parents are in New York with your brother. You and Adam should be surrounded by family and more Christmas cheer than you can poke a peppermint stick at. I don't know... There is something else. Okay...? Your tenants gave notice. John and I were gonna look for new renters, but then we were contacted by JCM Developers. They want to make an offer on the house. It's not for sale. You know what? Just come, get it appraised, and then see how you feel. You're just trying to lure me back to Colorado. I am. You know, I haven't even told you about the new praline toffee at the candy shop with the little flakes of salt on top. Okay, that's not fair. You know toffee is my love language. I think I deserve all the candy for this manual labor. Is that John? Would you tell him I said hello? You say hi for yourself. I'm serious. You should be here. Get closure on the house, and hugs. You're meant to be here this Christmas, I can feel it. They visit us every summer. Besides, we always volunteer at the soup kitchen for Christmas. Well, maybe we can find some place in Colorado to volunteer. That'd be fun. Hey, you know, you never told me what you want for Christmas this year. I don't need anything. Nothing? You want nothing for Christmas? Maybe we'll talk about it later. I love you. Love you, too, Mom. Sleep well. You would know what to do. You always knew what he needed. I wish... I wish he could just have five more minutes with you. Adam! You are so big! Hi, Grandma. Aw, we've missed you, kiddo. Are you ready to talk Yule Fest activities? After lunch, Grandpa. He has been planning all morning. I'll get the bags. Thank you! Do you wanna come inside for something to eat? Sure. Oh... hi. Oh, I'm so glad you and Adam are here for Christmas. How's he doing? He's been a little bit withdrawn lately. I hope being here isn't too much. Well, we are all together now, and it's going to be wonderful. You'll see, and I even baked his favorite cookies. The ones with the chopped-up candy canes? Yes! - I love those! - I know! How long does it take to plan one day? Planning the Yule Fest activities is a big deal. Yeah, and you can't do it all in one day, so tough decisions need to be made. Yes. Gingerbread houses versus a cookie decorating contest. It's lots of agonizing choices. Very funny. How's the world of commercial photography? It's a little spotty, but I'm actually working for this one agency, and they're talking about bringing me on full-time. That's exciting. It is. We'll see what happens. Hey, did you wanna stop by the house today? If you did, Maddy and I would be happy to go with you. No pressure. Um... Yeah. Yeah, I think we probably should. It'd probably be easier to go now rather than closer to Christmas. I'm gonna go, uh, just check on Adam. I'll ask him if he wants to visit the house. Okay... Here. This was your dad's. He said it was a Christmas star to guide him home. I like it. Go for it. This brings back a lot of memories. They took such good care of it. Yeah. Yeah, the renters were really good people. I forgot how cozy it is, you know? We used to sit in front of the fireplace for hours. There you are. Your old room. Yeah, I wasn't sure, but I remember the stars, like the key chain. I'm not ready to leave yet. We'll be back here soon, I promise. Hey, you know what I could go for right now? So, do you remember any of this? No, not really. I only remember riding on the trolley. Well, I guess that makes sense. You were barely six when we moved. Why did we move? Well, after your dad passed, I felt like we needed a fresh start. Nana and Pops lived in L.A... It just made sense. Do you miss it? Sometimes, yeah, but that's what makes trips like this so special, right? Yule Fest is one of the best things about Hollowford. You wanna go check out that ice sculpture? Sure. Okay. You can stay here maybe? I'll be right back. Oh, okay. Cool, cool. The first tween brush-off is the hardest. Excuse me? It's nothing personal. He just doesn't want to seem uncool in front of the other kids. Oh... How old is he, 11-ish? He's 10. Good guess. You have kids? No. My sister has four, all of them boys. You're an uncle to four boys? My other sister has another four. Also, all boys. Eight boys? Yeah. I guess that answers my question about what you do for a living. You're a professional uncle. Well, If we are assigning labels, I prefer the term "funcle". Yes, kinda my thing. Matthew. I'm Matthew Jamison. Oh, uh, Kaitlyn Morrison. I went to school with a Brian Morrison. Uh, he was my husband. I'm sorry for your loss. We were actually friends in high school. We sort of lost touch, but he was a really good guy. He was. Thank you. How did you two meet? Oh, gosh... uh, UCLA. Not on campus, though. We both worked at the same real estate office. He answered the phones. I uploaded photo listings. The humble beginnings of the architect and commercial photographer we became. You were a good team. I think we were. I know a real-estate joke, if you wanna hear it? Always. What does a house wear? I don't know. Address. A-ha? It's a good one, right? It's a good joke. - It's good. - Yup. My nephew taught me that one. He is only five, but he has incredible comic timing. That's sweet. So, is this your first Yule Fest? Oh, no. We lived here when Adam was littler. Brian used to talk about the amazing Christmas festival in his hometown, and I thought he was over-selling it. - He was not. - He was not. Jinx. You have to buy me a drink. Uh, no, no, Sir. I don't buy strangers drinks. Oh, wow. Well, real bummer that you can't talk anymore. I was enjoying our conversation. Excuse me? Hi, can I please have a cider? Psst! I haven't seen you here before. I'm visiting my grandparents for Christmas. So you don't have any friends here? No. Everyone needs a friend. Come with me. Hey, wait! Where are you going? Excuse me? Did you just see where that little boy went? What little boy? He was just here, wearing this Santa hat. You stole a Santa hat from a kid? What? No. It fell off when he ran away. I was just joking. Sorry. No, it's me. I'm not the greatest with jokes. Skye! I gotta go. My mom's making me get new shoes, but I like these ones. Hey, look! I'm Skye. Your shoe twin. Adam, nice to meet you. Mm. Wow. You're really enjoying this, aren't you? This is the best cider I've ever had. Well, I had to buy it for you. You were just following the rules. Exactly. Are you big on that? Oh, sure. I always have to drive the speed limit. I always have to apologize when I'm wrong. - No! - Oh, yeah. And the most annoying thing about me, I always have to make things right. Actually, that's not annoying. That's heroic. You know, I wanted to tell you that I am... Mom! Oh, hey, honey! Where'd you get that Santa hat? A boy dropped it and now I can't find him. Oh, okay. Well, we can swing by the lost and found on our way out. It was nice to meet you. Come on, kiddo. How was your visit to the house? Oh, it was good. It was emotional, but it made me feel closer to him. Aw, well, you know, you don't have to sell. You could just lease again? Mm... Delay the decision is one of my favorite decisions. Well, you've got time to think about it. I don't know. I... I was just offered a position with the firm that I've been working with recently, and I'm considering taking it. The problem is, it's... It's based in London. Oh, that... That's a lot further away than L.A... Yeah, it would be a big change, and I don't know if I could hold onto the house, but sometimes, it feels a little bit like I'm holding onto the past. I understand. It's so much more than just a house. See, that's what's really hard, because that house was a dream we built together. It's tough. Who's ready for the first Christmas adventure of the holiday season? I am. Great. I meant to give you that. Matthew's representing the developer who's looking to buy your property. You should give him a call. There he is. Merry Christmas, Howie. Hey, Merry Christmas, Kees. You remember my daughter-in-law? I sure do. Hello, Kaitlyn. Hi. This can't be little Adam? Not so little anymore. It's really good to see you. I hear you're the new chair of the Yule Fest. It's my new full-time job. Now, Adam, I know how important the trolley was to you, so it's only right that Mr. Kees is the first stop on our Christmas adventure list. The trolley's here? There it is. Did you get it running yet? Uh, we haven't been able to run 'er for about two years. Engine gave out. Can you fix it? I'm trying to get it going for Christmas, but don't tell anyone. I want to make it a Yule Fest surprise. There you go. Adam, look! A place to volunteer. I'll go find someone to ask. Excuse me? Sir, my son and I are looking for a holiday volunteer opportunity, and... Hey. Hi. I was hoping I'd run into you. Really? Yes. Mom, did you ask? I did. Hi, I'm Matthew. You must be Adam. I saw you in the square the other night. I hear you and your mom are interested in volunteering? You know what? Bummer. Our schedule's all booked up, so that's too bad. But volunteering at Christmas is our family tradition. You said that we'd find a charity that needs us out here. Well, I'm sure the food bank could use your help? Matthew, where are you hiding the good ones? We need to go big or go home. Well, we literally have to get it home, so let's not get too big. Not too big, good ones, over here. Follow me. Oh, Adam. I wanted to introduce you to my buddy, Louis. Louis, Adam. Adam, Louis. Cool. Did you make him? Yes, I did. How did you know that? It's the eyes, right? He's got my eyes. Oh! Hey, let me help. I'm fine. Indulge me. I gotta do something to earn this apron. This one! This is the one! Wow, this one's got a lot of girth. I love it. We might need some help getting it home, though. Well, I have a really good delivery service I can recommend. What did you pick up at the tree lot, apart from the tree? Would you stop? Now, that is a tree. Yeah. Now, we have a lot of food inside, and you're staying for dinner. How can I resist? You can't. Christmas rules. We'll get the tree. Do you wanna tell me what's going on? You didn't say a word at dinner. You tell me. I... I wish I could. You made the offer on my house. I tried to tell you... Matthew, can you come over and help us straighten out the tree? Yeah. Ah... We got this one when we were first married. How long ago was that? 55 of the best years of my life. You know, you can leave any time. Please don't feel obligated to stay here. I don't feel obligated. I'm happy to help. But, like, I don't want to keep you, you know? I'm sure you have way more important things to do tonight. Not really. Schedule's wide open. Well, that's terrific. We can really use your height. Well, I'm all yours. Matthew, how is that new resort development coming along? Uh, great. I don't know if you guys had time to talk about it, but Matthew's the one that brought the offer from JCM about the house? Oh, no, we haven't, uh, talked about that yet. So, I saw the brochure online. It looks really luxurious. Well, JCM does a great job with their projects. I mean, they've certainly changed the landscape around here from what it looked like back in the day. You grew up here? Did you know my dad? I did. I did know your dad. You know, I regret that we didn't really stay in touch, but I played football with him all through high school, and on our very last game, I was feeling a little down 'cause I knew the next time we'd be in that stadium, it wouldn't be on the field, we'd be in the stands, but he told me not to focus on that, but to focus on all the good times that we had. He was a pretty smart guy. He really was. I think it's time. Oh, you know what? I can't find a star in any of these boxes. I'll look for it tomorrow. I think it's out in the garage. Everybody ready? Yes. You did a good job. Three, two, one... Ha-ha! There it is! It's beautiful, Dad! Yeah, you made a great choice. Why didn't you tell me that you were the one who made the offer on my house? I tried to tell you. Oh, really? I missed that, because you literally said nothing about it. Look, I don't work for JCM. I'm a contractor, but they came to me. They wanted me to bring the offer to you because I'm local, and I know your family. Exactly, yes, you know my family, so you should have told me about it. I tried to tell you, but you had to go home. You could have told me any time. Hiding that information from me was a really weird thing to do. It would be if I was hiding it, but I wasn't. Do you want to know what the offer is? You're unbelievable. You should at least know what JCM is offering before you make a decision on what to do. How do I know if it's a good offer if I don't even know how much the house is worth? I could recommend someone to appraise it. Isn't that a conflict of interest? I played football with your husband, so I think we're bonded for life. Are we? Look, you... You don't have to like me. You're just collecting information. I'll call my guy, we can meet you at the house tomorrow, okay? 1:00 p.m... Goodnight. Goodnight. Thank you. Thanks. Merry Christmas. I did some research last night. I ran some comps, but this number is way higher. Well, it's a beautiful property in a great school zone. It's got a lot going for it, if you were to list it. I could start a trust fund for Adam with this kind of money. You know, speaking as a Morrison family friend, and not as a representative of JCM, if you made a few tiny improvements, you could put it on the market, see if you get an even better offer. What kind of improvements? Nothing big, painting, new lighting fixtures, new carpet upstairs, maybe a new porch swing? Even if I wanted to make improvements, I wouldn't know where to start. I could recommend some contractors. No, it's okay. Look, I am sorry about what happened when we met. When I... when I realized who you were, I should have told you immediately who I was. Well, thank you for your help with the appraiser. My pleasure. I was wondering if you and Adam would want to help me decorate some food drive donation bins? Put 'em out around town? Sure. I bet Adam would really like that. All right, Adam, here's your kit, and I'm just gonna be right over there talking to Mr. Kees. Cool. - See you later. - Okay. You can't do that alone. Are you talking to me? Yeah. You need someone to hold up your walls. You should ask a friend to help you. Come on. Hey, wait! Where are you going? Did you just see where that kid went? No. These were his glasses. You don't have to pretend to have people with you, you know? I'm not pretending. What are you doing? I make wreaths with all the leftover stuff Matthew gives us from the tree lot. Then we give them out at the library, where my mom works. That's cool. I hope people like them. They will. Do you want to help me build my gingerbread house? Yeah. Do you want to make some wreaths with me later? Sure. Okay. Do you like living in Hollowford? Yeah. It's hard to be new sometimes, but I like it here. I think I might want to move here. That would be awesome. Then I wouldn't be the only new kid. Yeah, I just don't know how to tell my mom. She wants to sell the house. We'll think of a way. We will? Yeah. Hello? Kaitlyn? It's Jenny. Jenny! How are you? Great. The proofs came back and the shots were incredible. As usual. Good! I'm glad they worked out. They always do. That's why I'm calling, actually. Did you have a chance to look at the offer that we sent over? Um, I did, yes. It's-it's very generous. Well, when I told them that you were considering it, they flipped and sweetened the deal. Full health benefits, and all moving expenses. Ooh... That's really tough for me to turn down. Um, well, you know, I would need some flexibility in my schedule initially in order to get Adam settled. Done. They really want you to say yes. I think... yes. Get up, get up! Ah... It's the first one I've missed all day. All right, let's see what you've got. Wow. Why am I not surprised? Beginner's luck, Jamie. Wow. Very nice. So, how's the project coming along? Materials have started to ship, and should arrive shortly after the New Year. Fantastic, and how are we doing with the property on Elm? Is she ready to sell yet? Miss Morrison is considering all her options, including other buyers. Seriously? I wanna get that deal done, Matthew. I understand. So, start applying a little friendly pressure. Well, I... I know the family, so... that wouldn't feel right. You're a rare bird, Matthew, and I admire that. I could use a man like you in New York. You don't have an office in New York. Well, I've been working on that. I'm helping you. Okay. I thought you were trying to steal this tree, and I'm about to let you have it because it's actually very heavy. It is heavy. Hey, none of the contractors on your list are available until after Christmas. Oh. I'm sorry to hear that. So, I was hoping you could tell me what the improvements are, and maybe I can do them myself? Here? Here, yeah. Gosh. Ah! Do you have experience? No... great. What's the rush? Well, I have just been offered a new job in London, actually, so Adam and I are leaving right after Christmas. That's great. It is, but then everything would have to be done by Christmas, and... You know, this was the first house that Brian designed, so if I'm going to let it go, I want to get the best deal possible... For Adam. Right, of course. Yeah. Will you help me? Yes. Yes, I will help you. Thank you. So, how's everything with Adam? Any regrets about coming here for Christmas? None. I think he may have even made a friend. What? Social learning happening before our very eyes. I'm so relieved. You were right. You know, you've got a knack for knowing what people need. Brian was the same way. You know, it's funny that you say that because I'm going back to school to become a nurse. What? Are you serious? What specialty? Well, um, labor and delivery is the goal. That's perfect. My labor and delivery nurse... And my doula... They were amazing. They worked together, and they were the first ones to really see me, really see that I was struggling. Well, how come I didn't hear about this? IVF was... really intense, and I didn't want anyone to think I was complaining about this dream baby. You know, you were probably exhausted. Yeah, I think I was struggling a lot more than I knew, and it made it really hard for me to bond with Adam when he was little. How come you didn't tell me? I felt guilty. Even now. I hate that that's how my relationship with Adam started. I never would have been able to handle it without Brian, and without the help of my amazing nurse. I mean, you are going to save lives just like that. I know it. You know you don't have to feel guilty. You're an amazing mom. Ah, I try. I'll settle for him just having a great Christmas. Wow, that looks fantastic! Well, I told you I'd help, and I'm a full-service operation. So, we can knock out these projects together, and then you'll still have some time to enjoy Yule Fest with Adam. Well, I wish I could say I didn't need your help, but I do. Should we get started? - Sure! - Yup. Thanks. Yeah, let's do it. Hey! I was just cleaning out the vents. Oh? I couldn't tell. Here ya go. Thanks. You're welcome. Matthew, I checked the food donation bin today. Uh-huh? There was barely anything in it. Ah, don't worry about it. As it gets closer to Christmas, I'm sure it'll fill up. Yeah, I agree. People will come through. But what if they don't? What happens then? I say we host a fundraiser for the food bank, here at the house! Honey, that would be really hard to pull off this close to the holiday. Well, we could talk to Mr. Kees and make it a part of Yule Fest? I don't know. That's a big job. Could be a good way to show off the house. You're for this idea? It could be a Christmassy kind of Open House. Yeah, and we could call it the Yule House, and we could decorate all the rooms inside with different Christmassy things, and then we could sell the tickets and give all the money to the food bank! You're really excited about this idea, huh? Yes! Okay, I'm in. Am I crazy for doing this? What, for trying to finish the reno and turn the house into a Christmas attraction in one week? Yes. No! Not at all. I mean, maybe a little, tiny bit, but in the best way. Adam seemed so excited. I haven't seen him like that since... What you and Adam are doing for the food bank is incredible. It'll make such a difference in people's lives. There's still so much to do. I hope I don't let anyone down. You won't. You sound so sure. I am. We can do this. How are the repairs going, Mr. Kees? They're coming along. Rose sent me with some of her famous Christmas cookies. I look forward to them every year. Thank you for the special delivery. We actually have a favor to ask. Well, you're in luck because I love doing favors for people, especially ones who bring me cookies. We're raising money for the food bank, so we're throwing a fundraiser at my old house. How can I help? Would you be willing to donate some free trolley rides to get people from Main Street to the "Yule House" on the night of the fundraiser? The Yule House? Each room is gonna have a different Christmas theme. You know, we haven't introduced a new event at Yule Fest in years. I think it's about time we do. Count me and the Jolly Trolly in. We won't let you down. Thank you, Mr. Kees. Thank you. Did someone get a Cricut as an early Christmas present? I work at an arts and craft store. If I didn't have one of these, I would lose all credibility. What did Kees say about the trolley? He's in. Great. So, we have seven days to decorate the five rooms. Whew, have we got the themes yet? Adam's trying to come up with some, but he hasn't gotten anywhere yet. He's outside waiting for Skye. She's gonna help him brainstorm. Hi! What are you drawing? This is my favorite view. See those white mountains? The snow, the bright-blue sky? There's nothing like it in all of Hollowford. That's my house. It's really good. Thanks. I still have to work at it. I'm working on my design skills. My dad was an architect. This was the first house he ever designed. Maybe one day, I'll get there. Do you ever have trouble coming up with ideas of what to draw? Sometimes. I'm trying to figure out how to decorate my house for Yule Fest, but I can't come up with anything good. When I'm not sure what I want to do, I let myself dream, and trust that the right idea will come to me. Go ahead, give it a try. Just start. It will come. I have something to show you guys! A neighbor helped me make them. What neighbor? I don't know, a neighbor. Let me see. Oh, you scared me. Is everything okay? Yes, yes. You didn't happen to see a guy out there, did you? Not you, too? What do you mean? Is this like a family joke? Like the time Adam saw the guy with the green sunglasses, or the Santa-hat boy? You guys are silly. We are silly. Come on in. Look who's here! - Hi. - Hi. You drew these? He gave me a sketchpad and a pencil, and then I just started drawing. Our house used to be full of drawings, sketches like this. These are incredible. I mean, the concept seems sound. Layout makes sense, it's clear. I am very impressed. So, there's a Snowman room, and a Winter Village room with Christmas trains. And a Santa room... I wasn't really sure about the last one. How about an Angel room? What do you all think? I think we should get started, huh? Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. You don't have to stay here all day. I know you have a real job. You must be exhausted. I love what I do, so I never really get tired. Well, I can relate. See? That's another thing we have in common. What are the other things exactly? We both love Hollowford. We love volunteering for charitable organizations. Christmas. Everybody loves Christmas. That is not true. My uncle Kenny hated Christmas. Poor Uncle Kenny. He was so misunderstood. Christmas is wonderful, but it can also be really emotional. There's another thing that we have in common. What's that? Empathy. Oh, looking good in here! Now, Adam and Skye are downstairs. Howard and I are heading home, but we'll be back tomorrow. Thank you so much. Are you going to the Yule Fest Christmas craft event this afternoon? I think I'll just stay here and keep working. Oh, no, you should come. You gotta get out in the world. You don't wanna become like Uncle Kenny. How's everything going with your mom? Good. I think seeing the house all decorated will convince her to stay. I think Dad would have liked us to spend Christmas in the house. That's nice. Good job! So, now that you've cut the patterns into your luminary, the next step is really simple. So you're just gonna take your sand, pour a little bit in the base, and then you're gonna take your battery-powered votive, place it on top, and something really plain can become something really special. It's a five-minute craft that brings a season of joy. Yes, Sir? Has anybody ever done this craft for charity? We're raising money for the local food bank. You mean sell luminary kits for people to make? Yeah! We can make them and sell them. We could write people's names on them. Or dedicate them to people. I think the Yule Fest Committee would be very interested in supporting this effort, if Clara doesn't mind giving us a hand. I'd love to see luminaries up and down Main Street. I think it's a wonderful idea, and knowing my uncle, he will give you all the supplies that you need. Thank you all so much for having me. You did great! Did you have any idea about this? No. Adam is full of surprises. You have a very special boy. Time flies so fast. Hang on to him at this age. Make every minute count. I will. Thank you. Yeah. Hey there! What's this? Some extra outdoor Christmas decorations we had in the garage. We thought you could use them on the Yule House. Yeah. You know what? It would be great to have some outdoor decorations. I'm gonna start loading the car. No, no, no, no, no, it's cold out there. I will deal with that project, and you stay warm. That's why I married you. I know. Hey, has anyone seen the star for the top of the tree? I haven't come across it yet. Oh, did you check the basement? Uh, not yet, but I will. I'll check it. I could go there with ya. Oh... What's going on? Hey, Adam. Look. That's how I remember him. Me too. Can I keep it? Absolutely. What's Matthew doing today? Oh, we're gonna see him later on at the Yule House. I wonder what dad would think of us spending all this time with him? Popcorn. Anyone want popcorn? - I do! - You do? - Okay. Popcorn? - Yeah. Popcorn. Yeah, butter. On it! Are you gonna tell me what's wrong, or am I just gonna keep working on the scariest Santa ever in silence? Sorry. It's Adam. Sometimes, he asks me these questions, and I'm convinced that I've given him the wrong answer. Sometimes, I pretend I'm asleep, or I inexplicably yell "popcorn!" Well, I think a lot of parents do that. Maybe not the popcorn thing. Maybe. Is there a particular question that Adam asked that's freaking you out, or...? No, not in particular, just tough questions in general. I just... Sometimes, I wish I knew if I was getting it right with Adam, you know? Well, when I'm anxious, I make a worry list. So, what are you worried about right now? I'm worried that Adam is gonna figure out that I have no idea what I'm doing, that I'm gonna buy him the wrong Christmas present, that he's never gonna know how much his father loved him. Basically, that I'm failing as a single mother, and he's gonna stop visiting, until one year, he comes home for Christmas, and he finds me buried underneath a pile of candy apples. Also spiders. That... that was a lot. I know. The holidays are... really stressful, and you have more stressors than most, so maybe you should give yourself a break? What do you say we meet up at Antonio's later? Grab dinner, decompress. Glass of wine? I love wine. That Santa's gonna haunt people's dreams. Yeah, I know. I'll see you at Antonio's. It's a date. Hello, there, busy bees... It's not safe for Kaitlyn in here! Oh, my gosh, I thought you said we were gonna keep it simple this year. Did you not see my shirt, "World's Best Auntie"? Oh, I've seen it. Just don't overdo it. Define "overdoing it". We're done wrapping Kaitlyn's gift. Okay, I'm opening my eyes. Whoa, Maddy... What? See the aforementioned shirt. Okay, Aunt Maddy, how would you and John like to watch Adam for me? - Of course. - Yeah? Yeah, what are you up to? I'm just, um, I'm just gonna grab a quick dinner, with Matthew. Won't be late. You know what? Take your time, because it takes John and I a long time to spoil Adam properly. What are you gonna wear? I don't know. It's just Matthew. I have a dress that you can borrow. We're just going as friends. Friends can wear dresses. It's not a date. It's not. It would be okay if it was. Yeah. You deserve to be happy. You know, Adam and I make a really good team. We like it that way, but thank you. I appreciate it. I'm gonna go take a quick shower. Yeah, so the condos face the mountains. It's... It's a beautiful view. That's why I need to secure the final property. Hey, how's everything going with Miss Morrison? Is she ready to sell? Uh, actually, she's throwing a fundraiser for the food bank on December 23rd. You should come. Uh, all the rooms will be decorated in different Christmas themes... Let me stop you right there. I'm not a Christmas guy. I'm a sports guy. Well, you could be both. So, she's not ready to sell yet? She'll be ready to list it after the event, and you can bid, see how it plays out. Okay, good. Good, good. So, how's everything else? The guys say that you haven't been around the site much lately... Oh, my guys are the best. They don't need me standing over their shoulder. It wasn't a criticism. I'm impressed by that. You know, Matthew, I've got a lot of pet projects in New York that could use your help. What kind of projects? Ah-hah, I thought you'd never ask. Look at this. This is my favorite. Okay, you see? See all through here? These are all subsidized units, along with our regular luxury ones, and this whole area here is commercial space that we're going to use to share with the residents and local non-profits. This is really different than what you guys normally do. Yeah. Yeah, it's not gonna be easy. I'm gonna need someone to shepherd this project that believes in it. You know, someone that has a feel for community. I think that person's you, Matthew. You look nice. Oh, thank you. So do you. Please. Yeah. Thanks, great. Thanks. I, uh, ordered a bottle of wine. Ooh, now we're talking. Nice to be out with a friend. To friendship. So, my first job, they tried to pay me in linen pants. It was a dry cleaner, and I guess there's a lot of people who don't return to pick up their linen pants. Wait, were the pants in your size? No, not even close. They tried to pay me in strangers' pants... So it's my job as a photographer, to sell the thing, right? But I couldn't see what I was selling. Everything was beige... The backdrop, the table, the cat. I was a last-minute replacement, so I didn't have time to do the proper prep. So, what were they selling? They were selling the color beige! - So, why was there a cat? - I don't know! "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree" is an overrated song. There, I said it. How dare you? I prefer "White Christmas", but what beats them all? "The Christmas Song". Thank you so much for this. It felt really good to take a step back and breathe. I took that job... in London? I swear, I'm more worried now than I was before I took it. I thought you wanted the job? Oh, I do. I'm just... I'm constantly second-guessing my decision. I mean, I want the stability of a steady job, but, more than anything else, I want what's best for Adam, so, I'm... I hope I made the right choice. I don't know. I get it. I'm actually considering a promotion, too. That's awesome! Yeah, but it's in New York. So, I guess we're both at a crossroads. Right. But you were brave. You decided to go for it. I just, I don't know if I'm ready to start over. Right. I'd have to find a new dentist. That's such a hassle. Yeah, it's... it's a hassle. Listen, I know you were anxious before, like when we did the list thing, and you're worried about making the right decision, but from where I'm standing, you are incredible. Oh, stop. No, I mean it. You're a single mom, out there killing it day after day. You are smart, funny, creative... I'm a really good cook. You're incredible. I can't do this. I'm... Thank you for dinner. I'm sorry. Sorry! Hi! Hi... Is there a reason you're avoiding me? - Avoiding you? - Yeah. No, I'm not... I needed candy. Oh, but you didn't buy any candy. I was checking on the candy. Is the candy okay? - Yeah. - Good. Well, that explains it, 'cause from back there it looked like you saw me, and then jumped into the candy store, and I didn't want to go in there because I didn't want to scare you, have you knock over a display shelf, run... Can we sit for a second? Yeah. Here's the deal. I was embarrassed... Am embarrassed, about leaving so abruptly from dinner. I felt something, too... in that moment we... should just talk about it? I don't think I can. Okay. - Is it? - Yeah. So, what were you doing before you dove into the candy store? I didn't dive. - You... - It was a duck. - Hmm. - I was Christmas shopping. Want some company? I'm a great gift-giver. And very modest, too. - Yes? - Yes! Huh? - No. - No? No. John would love this hat. I don't think anyone loves that hat. I don't know... I need something a little more light-hearted. What about a silly tie? Nobody ever wants to wear a tie, ever, and then when we're forced to, it's usually some work thing, so it can't have gophers riding a llama. That's tough, but it's fair. Oh, I know! What about the Cheese of the Month club? You said you were a good gift-giver. What? Who doesn't like cheese? Are you cold? Here. Really? Oh, no, I don't have to... I can't take your scarf. You didn't take my scarf. I offered it. Thank you. Hey, I'm sorry about... about before. You know, I haven't had a moment like that since Brian. If it helps, I haven't felt like that with anyone for a very long time. It's scary to be vulnerable with someone. Friends? Always. I'm a little nervous. Good evening, folks! Caroling will begin in 10 minutes. Our first song tonight will be "We Wish You a Merry Christmas." Yes! Whoo-hoo! Told you so, right? - Hi! - Hey! Where's Adam? Oh, he's waiting in line for Santa Claus. I'm a little worried about him. He was kinda quiet. Well, maybe he's quiet because he's mulling over what he wants. A lot of tough decisions happen in that hut. I think I'm gonna go wait for him over at the "Sacred Santa Hut". Look, don't... Don't mock the Hut. Oh, no, I would never. - Okay, good. - I'm very serious. I'll go with you. Okay. - Bye. - Yeah. Mr. Kees, how are the repairs going? Slow, but, um, I'm still hopeful the trolley will be ready. Keep your fingers crossed, Miss Maddy. Merry Christmas, young man! Come on up here and get your picture taken. You look like a gentleman with a lot on his mind. Yes, I am. Tell me, have you been a good boy this Christmas? I tried. I think you were. I'll check the list later, but it's a gut feeling. Now, what did you want to ask me for this year? I want to stay here in our house, in Dad's house. Have you told your mom? No. Why not? I feel scared, because I'm so happy here, but I don't want to make things harder on her. Sharing our feelings, and being honest with the people we love, helps us understand each other, even if it's not what they're ready to hear. I think you're right. Thanks. Merry Christmas, Adam. Merry Christmas. Wait. How do you know my name? Here you go, honey. Did you have fun tonight? You seemed a little quiet. I figured out what I want for Christmas. That's great news. What is it? I want to keep our house and move back to Hollowford. Oh... Adam, I'm... I'm sorry, we can't. We can. We have a place to live. I can go to school with Skye, and you can do your job here. I'm so sorry. It's... It's not possible. Why? Why can't we stay? Okay. I was going to tell you, but I... I just got a new job, and I've got a salary, and benefits, and it's in London. What? Yeah, it's gonna be an amazing adventure for us. We're gonna travel the whole world. It's gonna be a fresh start for both of us. No! I want our fresh start to be here. Please, Mom? Adam, I'm sorry. Honey? Honey? Are you okay? Adam told me that he wants to stay here, so I told him about London, and now he's really upset. Aw... parenting is not for the faint of heart. You can only do what you think is right. We all trust you. I wish I trusted myself. I know you'll find a way. Hi, honey. Grandpa dropped me off. You wanna help me paint? Did you have fun with Grandpa? Okay, I know you're really upset with me, and I want you to know that that's okay. We don't have to agree on everything. You might even hate me sometimes. It's all right, but what I don't want you to do right now is shut down, withdraw, because I have loved seeing you here. Your... confidence. Your voice. I haven't heard that in such a long time. I don't hate you, Mom. We're gonna be okay, wherever we are, because we have each other, right? Hey, since this fundraiser's coming up in a couple of days, what do you say you and I spend one last night at the Yule House before we leave? Does that sound fun? - Hi. - Hi. Sorry to interrupt, I wasn't expecting anyone to be here. Just wanted to drop these off. Oh, thank you. Yeah, I'm just giving Adam a night in the house before we leave. He's having a slumber party with Skye. Sounds like a great idea. Yeah, I just set them up to watch some Christmas movies in the Santa room, so they're basically in heaven. Awesome. Well, have fun. I'll just... I'll put these in the garage for now? - Yeah... - Wait! What? Do you want to come in, um, for a steaming mug of hot chocolate? It's the least I can do. You've been incredibly generous with your time, and energy, and... You had me at "steaming". I'd love to. Jamie called earlier. He really wants the property. He means well, but he shouldn't be pressuring you. No, it's... it's fine. I turned him down, but I might have to rethink that if the offer goes up. Mm. Well, you deserve to get the best price for this place. You stick with your original plan, and you can list it, and everyone can bid... Jamie, too. He's been so patient, and you've been amazing. I mean, you've made this place magical for me, and for Adam. Helping us throw this big charity event? It's the perfect way to say goodbye to this beautiful house, and you know, I realized that for as much time as we have spent together, you've never told me anything about your personal life. Hmm. Have you ever been married? No. I... I got close... once, but she left me after I moved back here. I was starting a business. She didn't feel like she was a priority, and she was probably right. It was my fault, but I didn't... I didn't know what was important back then. Do you know now? I like to think so. I'm sorry. I know you're not ready. Yeah... I'll see you tomorrow. Uh... I'll see you tomorrow. Thanks for coming, buddy. I never turn down good fusion food. Good thing New York's full of them. Any developments on the Morrison house? Well, she just wants to get the best price she can, and she deserves to. So, I think if you come up on your offer a little bit, you might get lucky. That's good to know. I'm gonna put a little extra something in your stocking this year. That's not necessary, but since you mentioned New York... I'm leaning towards yes. You are gonna love it. Anything you want, you got it. So, um, what tipped the odds in my favor? Uh, there's... no one to stay here for, and I know that now. Well, lucky me, huh? Oh, hey, I know you're not a Christmas guy, but I left some tickets with your receptionist for the fundraiser tomorrow night. I'll probably be working, but I appreciate it. Well, I figured, but just in case you change your mind. Hey. I couldn't resist the offer. I signed the contract this morning. I spoke to Jamie. He's over the moon. I can't believe this isn't going to be our house anymore. Yeah, it's a lot to process. Come in. Hey, Jenny! Yeah, absolutely. I do, I have to call you back. We're moving to London. Yeah, I know. You know, I think moms and dads have a real hard job, 'cause they're trying to balance what they want with what's best for you, and I know how you feel about leaving Hollowford, 'cause I'm starting a new job after Christmas, and it's in New York. Everybody is leaving. When will I see you again? I don't know... but what I do know is that we can't know everything that's in store for us, so we just have to... enjoy life as it comes, with its ups and downs, and be grateful for the time that we got to be together. Hey... I got you something. Hmm? Come here. Oh! Oh, he's got him! Touchdown! Oh, he's getting away! Down. That was fun. You nervous? You know what? No. For the first time, maybe ever, I'm really proud of what we did here. Yeah, me too. They're here! He made it. The trolley's here! Merry Christmas, Adam. Hi, Grandma! Oh, I had to be one of the first ones to see it all done, and we brought along a few friends to start the cavalry. - Merry Christmas! - Thank you! - Hey, Mom! - Hi! Mr. Kees... You made it happen. I had faith that it would all come together. Well, you were right. The food bank has just informed me that we have raised over $5,000! - What? - Wow! The Yule Fest Committee would also like to honor the hard work of Adam Morrison and Skye Julian with an award presentation at the Yule Fest Finale tomorrow night. Hey. I'm sorry, man. I thought everything would be over by now. Oh, you're not here for the event? Oh, no, no. I gotta get a jump on things. I mean, this whole property is gonna get rezoned for Commercial right away. Plus, I don't know how long the tear-down's gonna take. Tear-down? What are you talking about? Well, you know I lost the deal on East Channing, right? So, we needed a new place to build the high rise, and well, this place made perfect sense. They're tearing the Yule House down? Wait, you said that you were gonna keep most of the properties intact, especially the ones closest to downtown. Well, that was the plan, but then we went into a different direction. So, we like to keep the plans fluid. Right, Matthew? Wait, you knew about this? No. I... I mean, I knew they lost the Channing property, and were looking for a replacement, but... I can't talk about this right now. Come on, Adam. Kaitlyn... Walk away from the contract. What? I can't do that. I've seen you walk away from deals where you lost millions. Pick another lot. I will help you find it. It's not that simple. I bought the house. I can do what I want with the property. It's what we do. Not this time. Why? Because the house means something, and tearing it down isn't right. I'm sorry, Matt. It's just business. I thought you said you were trying to change this company. Do things that were more community-minded. I am. So don't do this. I am asking as a friend. Please. It's a done deal. Well, thank you for the New York opportunity, Jamie, but I have to decline. Matthew, come on. No. It'll never be just about business for me. Ah! You know what, I just need five more minutes. It's fine. Yeah, Adam went ahead with Mom and Dad. Oh! Well, you should go, too. Mom never found the star. You know what? I'll go check in the basement before I go. - Okay. - Okay. We'll see you there? - Yeah, see you there. - Great. Okay. Ah. Is... Is this possible? Come here. How? How? My wish! My wish came true! I wished for five more minutes for Adam, and he's not here. I have to get him... I've been with him. He doesn't need five more minutes. I'll be with him forever. He'll see the signs. You both will. Hey, please don't go? I can't do this by myself. You... You were... You were so much. I'm just me. Adam's kind, and capable, and he's smart, and generous. He's so full of love. Yeah. He's always looking for reasons to help people. Yeah. He's just like you. He got those things from you. You can do this. You've been doing this. ♪ The fire's glowing ♪ ♪ It's finally snowing ♪ ♪ Tinsel's shining ♪ ♪ Lights are glowing ♪ ♪ There's presents hiding... ♪ Told ya I'd finish that dance. I love you.

I thought so, too. I wanted to tell you in person. I'm so glad you did. Something tells me that this wouldn't have happened without you. I had to make it right. Thank you. You're very welcome. So... what did you want to talk about? When do you leave for New York? I don't. I decided I'm gonna stay. Watching everyone rally this past week made me realize this is where I wanna be. This is my community. This is my home. I am so glad you figured that out before it was too late. I hope we can stay in touch? Hollowford is not close to London, but what's a few thousand miles between friends, right? What if I don't want to be friends? Then I would understand. You, uh... you're starting a whole new life. What if I want to be more than friends? What about London? I've been thinking about it. About... what? I like American football. You do? And I like Hollowford, and I like the house that Brian built for Adam and me, and I like you. Matthew Jamison, food bank volunteer, and partner in Yule House shenanigans, will you go out on a date with me? I thought you'd never... Ask. Hey, Adam, come here. Close your eyes and put out your hand. Open up. I am so sorry it took me so long to figure out where we belong. Merry Christmas. We're staying? We're staying. Come here. Come on, let's go home.
