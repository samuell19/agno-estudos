Tomorrow night we will be, in Mazatl?n. Your house is all tidy. It's on the beach. Everything is ready. Real holidays. Yes. Is everything going well? I would like to rest. What happened on the bus... left me very exhausted. Where is he? How about a beer? Where is he? Do you want a beer? Where is he? He surrendered. He is detained in Edna, That's what I heard. It is small, but with all comfort. We're not home, my love. He is. Frank. He's in jail. You are at liberty. You can go to any place you want. I just want one thing. If he leaves the chain, you kill him. It does not matter. The guy is dead. I said I want it, understood? I want to look in your face... to touch a revolver in your belly and when I know, that he knows I'm going to kill him. May I ask you a question? You go there and ask the cops, by a visitor's pass. How will you arrive near this face? Find the idiot, which he assaulted. Tell him to withdraw the complaint, that was a mistake. Hunm, hunm... Suppose he does not want to do this? It's to tell him and do not ask! Then we take our people. We found it, You call me... I'll... I have a chat with him and it's done. Frank, there are people who would this without the police officers were ready to arrest him. I said I want it! I! Hey, for free, I never killed no one before, right? But this guy, I'm doing a special favor to myself. And this I will do before going to Mazatlan, or rest on any beach. Was I clear? Anything else on Majestyk? No, not much.

There's a Silver Star. Man is not a fool, right? Do not know. Let's go to him. All right, Ben. Sit down. I've been sitting for four days. I think one more day I will not will make a difference. When do I go to trial? The guy you hit, Bobby Kopas... withdrew the complaint. Good... Why did he do it? You said that you thought better. Not important enough to waste time from court. Do you think this is the reason? Lieutenant, whatever the reason is fine with me As soon as I can return, to my place. Best to stay here. Why would I do something? idiot like that Because of Frank Renda. He's still free there. Yeah, I know. The witness who saw Income kill, he was a cop. He was killed when Income has escaped. Without a witness, there is no case. You gave the Income a good reason, to want to kill him. And I see no reason, to think he will not try. So you want me as bait. Will not let me go, unless that I let him try to kill me? More or less. I have a feeling you I would like him to do this... to accuse him of murder. I thought about that... but I'd rather try of murder. If I remember... You wanted to negotiate... so you can go home and harvest your watermelons. All right, go get them. How did you sleep? I slept too much. You needed it. I tried again this morning, but it's the same thing. No one wants to work, for us. I talked to Julio, Tomas, and a few more. What is going on? Julio said, "Dude, I do not have personal for you, that's all. " Julio can achieve as many men as he wants. I know that. He sends them away, saying they are not good. That girl, Nancy Chavez... if it were not here, we would have no one. She brought more friends her to work. We'll have to get more people, or we're screwed. Even my wife and my son are working here. Good... I hope you have Better luck than me. 7-8 for base. He is driving your truck, heading west. I am seeing. July. Hey, Vince, let you out! How nice. I was looking for you. Why can not you get me some manpower? You were in jail. Mendoza was not. He told me that you, You've dismissed him for the past two days. It's the time of year, Vince. I have a lot of business. Other people have asked before. I'm asking now, for tomorrow morning. Twenty people. $ 1.40 per hour. Vince, I have committed staff, for more than a week. You're late, my friend, that is all. Is that you? Can you get me some people? Maybe in 10 days. I can not promise anything now. What the hell is that? Want to explore me? What do you You want a bonus? What? Vince, it's no problem. Of money. How can we get people, if we do not have any? Hey, Julio... what is the problem? Vince, do not you understand? I have to work, for living. And I can not do it In a hospital, you understand? It's ok. That I understand. It's ok. Vince... Next crop, okay, buddy? If he's here. I heard that you are, looking for people. Maybe I can get some drunk. Maybe I can, that you can not laugh again. If you hit me, you'll be back. in the chain before nightfall. Hey, why did you drop the complaint? I'm being a good neighbor. You think I am, plotting something Why do you think that? Seeing I lose my crop? You're mixing things up. You have serious problems... and is concerned about harvest of their watermelons. Have you been talking to anyone? Yes, who do you have in mind? Did he ask you to withdraw the complaint? I'm tired of talking to you. But, I'll tell you one thing. Someone who set fire to your tail, and I want to be there to look. Very handsome, tongue-in-cheek. Very cute. I had to give the change. Son of a bitch. Did you have a good flight? Yes. It was bad? How are you? It's ok. Hey, Wiley, how's it going? Your lawyer paid bail... and you will have to appear in the audience, but there is nothing against you. My God! See? Nothing like a little Lucky. What you have to say with, "luck"? The secret is, never run until you are being persecuted. And having a smart lawyer, available. Pretty smart. Your lawyer is waiting in the cabin that rented it for you. Hey. He wants to talk to you. Say it? What about my watermelon harvester? They left him free. The question now is, What do the cops have in mind? No, the question is, what he is doing? That's it. I just saw him. Probably at home, waiting for you. Mr. Income... I was wondering if later of the master to destroy him, Could I shoot him? Who's the idiot? It's our friend Bobby Kopas, the face that majestyk assaulted. He is ensuring that nobody works, to Majestyk, so no there will be a crowd here. Do you know him well? Well, I know he is, a great son of a bitch. He has some watermelons and thinks who is a great planter. How long has he lived here? Long time. It seems that I ask and you do not answer. I'll try again. Can you show me where he lives? Sure, sir, anytime. Now? You bet. We're here, Mr. Income. Sir. You said no one I was working. No harvesting staff. Only a few migrants, that he hired, that's all. Go some more, forward and back. How long have you been here? They're always out on the road, disrupting traffic. How long? Do not know. I think two or three days, sir. You do not recognize police when you see them? Cops? Are you sure? I did not think police officers They walked around here. You will get tired in a few days and they will leave. And we can expel the Mexicans. Will be easy. Stop. Hunm... Stop the car. All right, idiot... Skirt! But here? My car is in Edna. It's seven an eight mile walk. You, come here. I know him only half an hour, And you just said bullshit... so do not over see your face.

I do not know where you are it's helping me. But I watched over you, did not I? For him not to escape. Yes. You'd better get out now. Do what Lundy says. and never, never again... Talk bullshit to me. Understood? Yes sir Let's get out of here. Hi, Frank. Good to see you again. Hey, man, beauty. You got rid of them again. What are you doing standing there? Hi, Richard. Wiley. Hi, Frank. Hello, Dick. Hey... What do you think? Not bad. It looks like a rich ranch. Belongs to a stockbroker which I represented once. And where is he? In jail? Yes, Lewisburg. I was guessing. Conspiracy to defraud the government of the United States. Give me one too. Frank, where have you been? Looking at watermelon plantations? I've been busy. Your bail is $ 5,000 dollars and worth even the interrogation of the District Court in 10 days. What are you talking about? I thought you were free. You're. But they have procedures. Ah... Frank, this is not the time to do something impulsive. It has a watermelon, that I want to reap. Also, there are some great offers coming to me. Great Offers of important people. What do I tell them?

She was always taking care of her hair, washing, all sorts of things. Do you have kids? A seven-year-old daughter. Do you miss her? I have not seen her in two years. They moved to Los Angeles. Are you thinking of them? No, I was thinking that it's okay. It's worth knowing it better. Oh, I fill out a form. You read it and approve it or not. She was tough again.

I took my wife and children, to my mother-in-law's house. Did you call the police? Clear. They asked a few questions. But what could he say to them? Some men came. I do not know who they were. They told us to leave, or our heads would be plucked. Do me a favor. Load these watermelons. Take to the bus station. What are you saying? I will come back and finish, the harvest. No, it's over, Larry. A lot of them are good. Larry will arrange, the shipment. He will leave you in the city. You can catch a bus there. Because? That guy, Renda, came back. There is no more reason for you to stay here. Get ready. Hey, Vincent. I've been in a car where one subject to my side was killed. Again, a truck tried to run over me and some friends. He was in the union hall, when they threw a bomb and blew up the place. I do not need anyone taking care of me. Vincent... But if you do not either here, is something else. I do not want you here. The bus that goes to La Junta is always here. Do not worry, you will not lose it. Thank you, Larry. Good luck. Nancy, then you come back and see you, okay? It is not Majestyk, is Larry Mendoza. Yeah, I recognize him. This guy did not hear me. Hey, Larry. We told you to give, out and did not come back. Right? I'm helping my friend, delivering some watermelons. You had the chance to command and did not. Right? I will deliver these watermelons and I'm leaving. You will not see me again. Come on, Larry. I swear to God. I only work for the Dude, that's all. Right. Larry Mendoza. What is the room he was in... placed after surgery. Where is he? This one. The warehouse guy did not see anything. He did not even see the car. What did they do to him? They broke his legs. I'm sorry. Hey, Larry. Larry? I'm so sorry. Vincent. Larry, who were they? You know them? Do you know who they were? Yes, the same faces, last night. And Bobby Kopas. He was there Oh, I know! They are not joking. They did this to me... and they will kill you! Oh... Oh, Vincent. Want to make me feel better? Go away. Hide yourself somewhere. There's nothing wrong. Why the truth is... they want to kill him. Majestyk, I feel sorry for your employee. He's not just my employee. A policeman was killed last night. Run over or dead. At the same time their migrants left. We locate them and we talked to them. Why do not you talk, with Frank Renda? The Denver police have a of observation in that place. He was not there. We do not know where it is. You do not know anything about anything. Stay away from me. If we do, you know what will happen. Let's see what happened, since you are close to me. So far, he has chased away my people... threw a bunch of watermelons... broke my legs friend and killed a policeman. Do not tell me about police protection. Take off your "heroes" of my property. If you die, you can not harvest your watermelons. If I die, it does not difference, right? You know. You're on your own. Lieutenant, I've been there for mine from the beginning. Are we really out? Let him think so and we'll see what happens. On the side of the truck. See? At where? Hell, he was right there. He entered the house? He must have come. The Mexican girl is inside. Where are the other boys? They're in the back of the house. Keep watching. I'll tell, to Frank what's going on. It's not happening anything, as you see. Sonny, if you keep your eyes open and your mouth shut... you can see something! What do you think? Do not know. But let me tell you something. I will not worry. The truck's over there. Yes? What the hell are you doing here? I got a ride back. There's a bunch of guys out there armed. Did they see you arrive? Do not know. I did not see anyone. I think it will not, get rid of me. Yes of course. Until I find a way to get you out of here. At least, I do not think they will do nothing until Income appears. Oh, you know how to use it? You point and pull the trigger. Is not that what you do? Does not matter. As long as you stay here, stay down. If you see any Move thing, let me know. It's ok. He got out of the truck and entered the house. Alone? He was. Kopas said that he has a girl inside the house. It was here before the guy came back. Men waiting to kill him, and he takes his girlfriend inside. Probably did not think, that I was going to kill him so soon. Perhaps. Have a drink. Thank you. We can not enter your home. The police will be, waiting for us. We have to think of something. Hey, I can not anymore. Spend my time here. Since you want to kill him personally, will have to wait for the right moment. I do not have time! Are you understanding? I do not know how much time more Income will wait. But I will not wait. I'm going to change this. Good morning, Mr. Income. You can take it. Sure he is inside the house. And there's no way he's out. You saw him? I think he locked himself in the bathroom. This is either hidden under the bed. I asked you a question, man. Well, no, sir. I did not see any movement, but it's there. There is no other place, where it may be. All right, let's get him out. With calm and tranquility. We'll take him to the car. The woman, too. Mr. Renda, what will we do, if armed? We'll have to disarm it, of course. No, you will be the first to enter through the door. We'll be right behind you. Mr. Income, I... I've never done that in my life. In other words... maybe I'm not very good at it. Do you understand what I'm saying? You'll do well. As I said, you will, the first to cross the door. We'll be right behind you. You will do very well. We have to current! Put that back in the truck. After powering up and starting up, do not stop or slow down the speed, until you reach the cafe. You can not... Listen to what I'm talking about. When you get to the cafe, stop and get out as fast as you can. Do not look back. You can not be alone. You need somebody. What are you doing enough already. Here are the keys. Let's go! I knew it. Convertible blue, white hood. Going west on the road. 7-8, please wait. What is it, Hal? Income in your pursuit. They are going west on the road. All right, put all the units in action. Yes sir. Call the airport. Get me a helicopter. What are you doing? You're going the wrong way. There's a road on the other side. of that field. They are heading there. Keep the direction. First road to the left. Continue behind them and do not lose them. Stop! Go to the other side. There is no way to get rid of it from you have I already told you not to. Tell them to watch down there. Look down there. This is their hunting territory. He brought us here. It seems that we are only a few miles from the cabin. Do you want to go to the cabin or not? He deceived us. The harvester of watermelons deceived us. Yes, F-4J. 201 is going south. It looks like a blue convertible with the white hood... About 800 meters, the front of the truck. And he's walking fast. One moment, he disappeared. They must have deviated through the forest. Wait a while and we will give the coordinates. I do not understand, because of all this. Could someone explain me what's up? Frank? Calm down, please. Can I start doing the suitcases or not? You know, I think he it's in those trees. You are seeing something, which I do not see. You want to shut up. Give me the binoculars, Wiley. Get it here. Come on, Frank, come on. Get it over with! I have work to do. What do you think of this guy? Is he anxious? Wiley, you're going to talk to him. Where are you? I would like to talk with you. Hey, Wiley. Yes? Come here. Go back and tell Frank... if he wants to get things right between us, we do not have much time. The police are on their way. I have nothing to do with that. Who's in there with him? Lundy and Kopas. Nancy. Get back on the road. And wait for me there. What will you do? Do not know yet. I'll take the shotgun. Where did she go, Mr. Income? He must have captured her. Yes. Maybe they're gone. And he took her with him. He's still here. Let's go up. Maybe we can see it from there. Yes. I did not tell you to climb. Stay down there and watch. I'll do that, Frank. Find out where he is and I will make him leave. Lundy, he's going back to the woods. Pick it! At where? In fact you have not seen him. I just told Lundy that I did. You used Lundy. You used it as bait. I dont know what I'm doing here. I do not care, with the watermelon harvester. This is not my business now. This is not my business. I do not want to go through with this. Stay away from me. Get out of here. Not Get out of here! I'm unarmed. He'll kill me! You have a choice. Stay here and I'll kill you. I'll stay. Hey! Where is he? He's on the stairs. Do you want to live? Yes. Stay on the trunk, from the balcony and do not move. Let's go. Hey, boy. Check it out, Richie. Bob? Bring it here. I'll take it. Hey, buddy. As I said, You're in the wrong branch. Where is Renda? The one behind, dead. Get your truck. I want to talk to you in the city. Let's go. Hey, Lieutenant... you were right. He really wanted to, kill me.
