What up? Look at you. Look at you. Alright, alright, alright. Alright. Amazing. Look at you. This is amazing. You guys came tonight man. That feels good. I'm a comedian and I think it's fucked me up. Because I've done thousands of shows. As a comedian, I get way better but as a person I get way worse. Because I've bombed in front of hundreds of people. Imagine what that's like. You do the joke where your like, "And then this happened." ...and everyone in the room is just like, "Uhhhh" ? You know? But then, by the way, you have to keep going. You gotta be like, "Anyway, I was at Verizon the other day." And people were like, "We didn't get the first part, dick face." So you develop a thick-skin because you have to. And now, things that used to matter to me. They don't matter as much anymore. Like if someone doesn't like me, I'm just like, "You really don't know what it's like." "Bomb in Omaha" or some shit. So now because of that, sometimes I do shit just to get a reaction out of people. Just to make sure, I'm still capable of feeling badly about stuff. Yeah, it's fucked. Like here's an example. The other day I was at this coffee shop, and this guy was in front of me and he was ordering, and he goes like this, "Uhm, I'll have a small cup of coffee." And I had to stopped myself from going like this. "Man, I'll have a small cup of coffee too." Part of me wanted him to turn around and be like. "What the fuck !?" Just so I can be like, "I'm getting stronger" I do shit like that all the time. Like here's is another example of that kind of behavior, alright. Recently I was working out. I was at the gym. That's how I get so fucking jacked. Nah, I'm not. Nah. My legs are honestly, my legs are thin. I'm not proportionate, like, I get my upper body is bigger, I feel like, I look like a fucking genie coming out of a bottle. People are like. Do I get three wishes? Nah, I just got this weird body. You know. So, I was working out. And this guy was working out next to me, he was a white guy, okay? But also he was pasty, you know? You know white guys that are so pasty that if you were to smack them, that hard anywhere on their body, they would immediately turn bright pink, right? Like, fuck those kinds of guys. I don't like those kinds of guys. It's not his fault, but it is, you know? Like hey guy, don't be pink, okay? How are you pink? What are you, balls? Balls are pink. So umm... Also this guy was also blonde. But also he bleached his hair even blonder than that. So this guy looked like a real piece of shit, ok? Like, he was so white and blonde. That if I just looked at him and gone like this, "c'mon man". He would have gone like this, "No, I know." So I couldn't help it and, I looked at him in the mirror and out loud I go like this. "Oh, cool! A vampire is here" And he heard me say it but also he saw my mouth say it. In the mirror. But he didn't do anything, so. I feel like I won! You know, I feel like I won the day. But this is the best example of that kind of behavior. Ok? Recently, I growled at a baby and... Yeah, and I'm not sorry. As a matter of fact, fuck that baby, and let me tell you why. Ok? So First of all, this happened at the mall. Ok? And, the baby was like two or four, or like nine or eleven. I don't know, do you know what? That's the thing about me, I have no idea how old a kid is. Do you know why? I'm not a creep, that's why. Ok? If you know how old is a kid and you don't have kids. Get in your van and get the fuck out of here. Ok? For real, listen. Imagine being just some guy and your like, "That one's gotta be seven." Like, how the fuck do you know? Shave your mustache. So... ...so I growled at this baby, and... and when I tell you why I growled at this baby, your going to have a realization. Your going to be like, "Oh yeah, babies do do that too much." Alright? This baby was looking at me for fucking way too long. Ok? Hey baby, figure out what I'm about, wait, quick, thing your doing it. Glance, baby, hey baby, glance. Alright? If you can't glance, you're not ready for the world. If you're not ready for the world, don't come to the mall, okay? Adults were ready for the world! That's why we go to the mall. We can glance all day long, we're like, "That's a guy, got it", move on. But babies don't do that, they're still figuring shit out. Your like the fourteenth guy they've ever seen in their lives. They're literally thinking some shit like, "What, another one!? Wait a minute, he's like my Baba. He's not my dad!? Why does he have jeans on, just like my dad? Who keeps making all these guys!? Who keeps making all these jeans!? There's so much shit they don't know. They're fucking idiot babies. Ok? So I growled at this fuck boy. What? Because I said fuck boy? He was. You didn't see it, I was there, I saw it. He was a baby fuck boy, he was. He was, he had his Supreme diaper on. Let me ask you a question. What's the deal with people who wear Supreme? Why do have to wear all the articles of Supreme clothing... at the same time and be riding the Supreme bicycle? Don't be doing that, alright? Also, how about people who are wearing over the shoulder bags? Hey, fuck you! What do you keep in there, eggs? What's that for? Also, imagine being a real guy And your like, hold up, I'm almost ready. Let's go, got my eggs, just in case. Whoa, don't bump into me man, there not... They're not hard boiled. What are you trying to... Trying to make a scrambled dude? So I growled at this baby. Ok? Here's why, because you can't talk to a baby. Know what I mean? That's not my fault, that's his fucking baby's fault You're not going to use me to learn how to talk. Ok? If you don't come already correct, then we're not fucking talking. Right? People fall victim, that's how babies learn. They use you to learn, how to talk, right? 'Cause they're so cute it works. They come up like, "Nah nar nar nar nar" Then your like, "Hi, how's it going?" And then they're like, "Now I know some words, bye bitch." And your like... People fall victim of it. They like doing cute shit. They're like "Are you ok, is everything?" "Are you hungry?" In the meantime baby's like, "I don't know what that means." Are you tired? "Hey, I don't know what that means!" "Are you cold?" "I don't know what that means!" Like, if an adult looked at me, I would know what to do. I would do the thing an adult does when, when another is looking at him for way too long. Right? I'd be like, "Hey man, do you have a problem?" Then the guy would be like, "I'm so sorry, no problem." Or he would be like, "Yeah, I have a problem!" And then I'd have to fight that guy. And then either I win and I'm like, "So from now on, no more looking at me." Or he beats me up and I'm like, "Okay, you can look." Those are the adult rules. This baby doesn't know those fucking rules. Right. Imagine if I tried that with this baby. If I was just like, "Excuse me baby, do you have an issue here?" The baby's going to be like, "I don't know what that means." So I growled at this baby because I was like, "That's how you get a baby to stop looking at you." Probably, I bet. You know? I was like, "What kind of growl should I do?" Because I haven't growled in... well I mean I've never growled. But... I was like, "What kind of growl would scare me if I was a baby and an adult did it to me?" And I got the growl, it was nothing special. I looked in this baby's eyes and I went just like this... AHHH EHHH! Yeah! Dude, I would have shit myself. Ok? If even now, as an adult, I'd be like. "What the fuck are you doing? I gotta go." Like this. I didn't think about what could happen after the growl. Which is like a problem I have in my life. I was just like, "Let, I literally thought I..." "Let's just give this baby a little taste of what real life is like" This is what happened right when I got done growling. As soon as I got done growling, the baby immediately goes like this. AHHHHHHHH!! And then I got scared, I was like, "No, no, no! It backfired!" Then the mom turned and looked at me. By the was, I didn't even know there was a mom was there, okay? In retrospect that's really dumb. ...because no babies can be at the mall without a mom. It's not like they're just in their crib and just like, "I need cargo pants!" And then run to the galleria. Also here's how dumb I am, for a split second when she looked at me, I actually thought, "It's cool, how hard do I have to growl at the mom?" Imagine if I tried that, just like. RAHHH! HAHA! WOAH! ALRIGHT! Security comes... RAHHH! RAHHH! RAHHH! Abort! Abort! Get the real cops, he's growling! "Come here, coppers!" RAHHH! RAHHH! RAHHH! ...helicopter. RAHHH! RAHHH! RAHHH! You know what I did there though? I just bitched out. I looked at mom and went like this, "I don't know what's wrong with your baby." I didn't do anything, and he's turning me.... You could be a bad mom, look into it. And then I nervously walked into a Forever 21! Which is only thing creepier than growling at a baby. And I did both of those. I was like: "Come here kiddo. ROWR!" Alright, let's see what's up with teen skirts nowadays. "Sir, you need to get the fuck out of the mall." "Oh, I know. I lost today. I lost today." So I got in my van and I left. Thanks , you know a lot of people... a lot of people would ask comedians like after shows, they'll be like "Is all this stuff you say on stage, is that true?" and answer in my case, so far it's yes. That's where I am at in my life. I am a thirty-nine-year-old man that growled at a baby in a mall. Do you know what? This is what... Well, there's one part I made up is that, there was no Forever 21 I made that up to make you laugh! Gotcha! Do you want to know what really happened? I don't know if this is better or worse. But, this is what really happened. So the whole thing went down. The baby looked at me, I growled at the baby, the baby screamed and then the mom looked at me and then I looked at the mom and I went like this: "I don't know..." I didn't even say don't know! I said "I no know". I definitely do shit like that because, I've bombed early on my career a lot. Like I said, you develop a thick skin, and now I do stuff like that. So I think I can feel like a real person. Like by the way that means I'm a bitch, for sure. Definitely, that's something that minuscule has affected me on that grand a scale. It means that I've had a easy life, for sure. And if I'm being honest, I have. Which is a weird thing to admit as a comedian. Like when I tell people I am a comedian, a lot of people say, "Ahh. You must have had a fucked up childhood" Dude! No! I didn't man. My childhood ripped. Man, I had so many toys. Like my parents... My parents were always there for me! That's hilarious, like... Anytime I was like, "Dad" he'd be like "Yeah?". You know like. Yeah, they tucked me in every night. They'd stop at the doorway, they'd be like... "Remember, we love you." Like dude. "Go to bed!" Anytime I was scared, I'd run from my room to their room. I'd be like, "Guys I'm scared" They'd be like "Of what?", "Everything's great!" Oh ya, then go back to sleep. Like. I know man. They're still together now! I tried to break them up the whole time, they won't. I need that, I need "Street Cred" man. People say, "Comedy comes from pain." I don't have pain, I need pain. You know. To get that extra level. I need pain, like I need someone to like lock me in the basement. And finger my asshole for a month. Yeah, and then I'd do a show and you guys are like: "Ahh, something is interesting about this guy now." "He's got a real story to tell." Hell yeah, my parents are as good as fuck dude. My parents are good. My mom is really... She's like always been like a little bit too much on the over protective side. Like even now as an adult, she'll still... My whole childhood up until now. This is what she says on the phone always, she never doesn't say this, she'll say: "Are you wearing a jacket?" "Are you wearing it?... Well put on a jacket" "Like ma, it's August, I just woke up" Like. "Put on a jacket on!" - "I have it on" "Put on another one, you never know" I said: "Or what?" This is what she says: "Or your going to catch a chill." Dude, who fucking cares? Do you know what happens when you catch a chill? This is what happens when you catch a chill. You go like this: "Brrrr". That's it! You don't go to hell! My mom's nice, dude. She's a nice lady man. If you saw my mom, you'd be like: "That's a nice lady." You know how you know she's nice? Because she stands like this, dude. That's how nice ladies stand. The closer together you are, the nicer you are. Right? That's why a bitch stand like this. One time I saw a really nice lady! And she was standing... I said "What wrong?" "I gave too much." Yeah man my parents, you know, they did stuff. Everybody's parents does stuff wrong, sometimes they do stuff right. You know I like to talk about the good stuff. Here's something that they did. I know. That I think they did right for sure with me is that My whole life from childhood until now. I never touched a drug, ever in my life. Ever. And I say that because I know... I look like I railed a bunch of coke in the back. Ok like, I know I look like that. I know I look like the guy that's just like: "I don't give a fuck what it is, I'll try it." "Where do I put it? My nose, my arm, my ass?" "Whatever gets me high baby!" Like, I know I look like that. I do. By the way, I look like I sell it too. For sure. I look like I sell it and use it. I look like I sell it to me. That's how I look. I'm like, "Here you go me." "Why thank you me!" "You give me the best deals, me" "That's because I'm Us" I'm both guys! It's like "Fight Club." Here's another thing that is also true that nobody ever believes me. I always have to say it like twenty times in a row. I never drank alcohol once in my life. Ever. And whenever I tell people that, they just don't believe me. I always have to say it like twenty times in a row. Like, it'll come up as it does sometimes. I'd be just like, "Yeah, I don't drink. I never have." And they'd be like, "Really?" And I'm like, "Yeah." And it would be... and I always say this: "Ahh, cause you had a big problem, and now you don't anymore?" I'm like... "Nah, I just don't." "- Really?" "Yup" "- Ever?" "Ever" "- Never?" "That's the same thing as ever" "- Zero times?" That's what I'm saying. "- Not even once?" I just said zero, how the fuck is it once? That's like being like: "Do you have a pen?" "No." "- You got two pens? What kind of a fucking asshole would I be if that's how I answered questions? It's just like, "Well originally I only ask for one pen." "But technically I have got a total of two, so." "Thank God you came with that follow up pen question." "There you go buddy! There's both my pens" I never did... I think I never did drugs... I thought about this. I think I never did drugs because my parents never forced me not to. Do you know what I mean? Like that's how you get your kid to do drugs, for sure. You look at them and say: "Fucking, hey!" "Don't do drugs" Cause then your kid's like: "- What's that?" - Yeah, yeah, yeah, good idea mom and dad, yeah." "- Yeah, I'll be right back from not trying all those drugs." My parents did it differently, this is how they would do it. They'd look at me and they'd be like: "Look we don't want you to do drugs, drugs are out there." "- But obviously we can't stop you because your your own person." "- So all we ask is: If you do try them, be safe about it." And then I would be like. "AHHHHH?" "I want to disobey you, but I don't know what it is you don't want me to do." "Give me a rule so I can be naughty." Never did drugs man. Whatever. You know? I like my life. Like it's also I'm a white guy, you know? Like it's... It's way easier to be a white guy in the world. Well, you know... historically. Right? Last year it got a little bit tougher to be a white guy. Do you know how you can tell...? A lot of white guys are in the media right now. Saying stuff like this: "- No, no, no, that's not how I meant it." You know what's definitely changed for white guys? You gotta keep your dick in your pants. Way more. Way more! Almost always. You should wait until the girl to says something like: "- Can I see it, definitely.?" Even still it wouldn't hurt to be like: "Can you repeat yourself, please?" Yeah, you gotta keep your dick zipped up man. I keep my dick IN MY PANTS! Always, I pissed my pants. I don't give a fuck It's gross, but I'd rather hear: "- Ewww" than clink. You know what I mean? I ain't going to jail. Shit is real out there. You gotta be careful. Even in romantic situations, you gotta to be careful. Make sure to take your dick out just a second at a time. To make sure it's all good. Yeah, just like zip, One Mississippi, boom. "How ya feeling?" "Are you uncomfortable?" "I have some power-aide if you'd like?" "Just like some Crudités and power-aide?" "Let's experience the 2nd second, shall we?" Here we go, zip. "One Mississippi, two...! Oh oh run, she's tweeting." Do you know what's the truth though? Like for real? How do you know somebody wants to see your dick!? Do you know what I mean? Like, when it comes down to brass tax. Like. How do you know? How do you know, that someone knows that they want to see your dick? I'll tell you how. Someone says: "- Hey!" "- Gotta see that dick!" But that's so rare. That only happens like one or zero times in a entire life. And it's usually by a homeless guy. On the other hand. How do you know somebody doesn't want to see your dick? How do you know? Do you know what I'm talking about? Like, how do you know for sure? That somebody knows, that they don't want to see your dick? I'll tell ya how. Somebody says: "- Psst, hey, I don't want to see any dicks." But again, that's so rare. That only happens like four or three times in a entire life. And usually you talking to a homeless guy. My point is, there's a lot of gray area in between those two situations. And we're not all good at reading signs! A lot of us are fucking dumb guys. Right? It's not like we're mind readers like Professor X, from X-Men. You know? Just sitting there like: "- PHHH AHHH" "I'm getting a vision! ARRR!" "- They want to see my dick." By the way, Here's my problem with X-Men movies before I move on. Ok? There's so many X-Men movies. They don't show all the mutants that would be in the world. They only show the bad-ass humans like, Wolverine or guys who could fly. Alright? If mutants are in the world, there would be the mutants that got the raw end of the deal. mutant-wise. Like there would be the guy with that power that's just like: "- Yeah, I know, I know. It sucks, but..." "that's my power." I just know when people want to see my dick. That's what I know. Fuck that dude. I would love to see that guy's origin story. It's just like: "- Can go on one mission, please?" Professor X says: "- Why the fuck would I take you?" "- On a mission. How does that help us against Magneto?" Why the fuck!? "- I gave you uniform, right?" "- And what did you do with it?" "- Yeah, I cut off the dick area, in case." "How does that help?" "Last mission your dick was flapping everywhere." "And hit Beast in the eye, he has pink eye, as bad." "- How does that help us against Magneto?" "- I have a guy who could take off his glasses..." "- and laser beam the whole enemies. We go home in three minutes." "Why the fuck would I take you?" "- I don't know." "The only thing I know for sure..." "So you definitely don't want to see my dick right now." Yeah, but that's, you know, that's like who I am... That's what I know, I'm a white guy. Right I am a white guy and that's where I've been. I've been a white guy for like six years. I didn't realize until recently, this is how dumb I am. I didn't realize till recently, that the world is different for a white guy than it is for somebody whose not a white guy. Until all the stuff was exposed on the Internet. And all the articles I've been reading, that's how dumb I am. I never used to read articles. Have you read the articles? They're really hard to read. I read an article the other day on North Korea. And halfway through I was like: "I don't think I get it", you know? How dumb you have to be to be like that? I was just like: "There's too many names in this article I don't know who's who anymore." An article has to be about one guy. If you add another guy, I gotta start over, to see who the fuck everybody is again. For real, I never read names, I'm always like: "Ya ya ok ok, but what did he do?" And then half way through I'm like: "Wait a minute, who's Ryan?" And then people ask me what's going on in the world. Because I'm a person. They want to talk or whatever. They'd be like: "- Hey man, did you hear what happened?", ...and I already know. "Nope" But I'll trick them, I'd do this thing where I'm like: "Well it depends on which thing your talking about." It's a crazy world out there, huh? Then they have to say it. Whatever happens in the world, nothing surprises me anymore. It's crazy. They'd be like: "- The other day, did you hear?" "- At Sea World?" "What?" "- When the dolphin jumped out of the tank?" "- And it went into the stands?" Ahh, c'mon! And then... "- It started flipping around in the audience." "- So, the sniper shot him." "- To make sure that it wouldn't fuck anyone." I'm like: "What? I'm an idiot, dolphins fuck people?" Now I gotta Google. "Do dolphins fuck people?" Now the government knows I'm googling, "Do dolphins fuck people?" And they're just like: "- We got an idiot, we got an idiot here." "- He's bad for society. We gotta keep tabs on him." "- He's Googling. Do dolphins fuck people?" "- He was trying to read an article the North Korea" "- But halfway through, he sorta gave up..." "- And just started Googling, do dolphins fuck people?" "- And then he didn't click on any of the links for that." "- He just click on images!" "- Then he saved them to a separate camera folder and titled it, fun." "- Uh oh, he's airdropping them to strangers at a Quiznos." "- We have a real fucking idiot here!" "- He's an idiot, we got a bad guy, "we gotta keep tabs on this fucking bad guy." By the way that's my new shit, is airdropping random photos to strangers. Dude it's so funny, man. Not everybody knows what airdropping is yet. So let me just tell you, and then I'll tell you what I do. So look. This is what airdropping is. If you have an iPhone. You don't need to have someone's phone number, to text them any picture that exists in the world. Hey Apple, pictures of buttholes exist. Hey, Apple! How you gonna let that happen when pictures of buttholes exist? Dude, I do it all the time. I did it on the flight out here. I was at the airport. Yah, and I Googled the first thing that came to mind. Which is "Asian Family". Now Listen, ok. That's not racist, but do you know what is racist? Is that the first 25 pictures when you Google "Image Asian family". Are all of Asian families singing karaoke! Alright? It's true. So I took the first picture and I saved it to my camera folder. And I was like: "Everybody on this flight is getting this Asian family", alright? So then, when I got on the plane, I looked to see who had their Bluetooth on. Man, there was so many Bluetooths on. I just sent them to all. I went boop boop boop. Then I looked behind me, ...and so many people on the plane went like this. "- There's an Asian family onboard, I think I got the wrong picture." That's so gangster. I'll take a picture of you. Switch seats. Send you, you. And then watch you try and find me. Do you understand how fucking hilarious that is?! I am thirty-nine. That's like the worst horror movie ever. Dude's like: "- What the fuck? What? Where is he?" "- It came from over there." And I'm just in another seat looking at you like: Ah hahaha! Ah hahaha! "I'm thirty-nine!" "Ah hahaha!" Fuck! Oh man! Hey, dolphins fuck people. That's a real thing. That's a real thing. That I didn't make up. Dolphins fuck people! Dolphins fuck people! Dolphins fuck people! Hey, are you listening to me? How come when I say that, everybody's not running around? That's insane. How about I say it like this, it's way scarier this way? "Dolphins fuck some of us." Yah, how is that not something everybody knows and thinks about all of the time? Teach it in school! Teach it in school! Dolphins fuck us, dude. That's insane! I thought about it ever since I learned dolphins fuck people. Like... You people that say, normally: "- Hey, you hungry?" I'm like, "I don't know, dolphins fuck us, like..." "Maybe let's stay inside. Ha ha ha." If you Google it, which you will for sure. After the show. The first few links that comes up, they call it "Dolphin rape". Like yah, you know. You don't need to use that word for click bait. Like, we know it is rape. Of course. Like, everyone knows that, that would never be consensual, ok? Like there's some guy out there that's like: "- Your telling me the guy was always swimming away!?" Highly unlikely. Of course it's rape, it's always rape! I would go as far to say this: "That's the only way that if it does happen, it is your fault." I know every time I say that, the crowd gets so weird, but listen. Of course it's your fault if you get fucked by a dolphin. What are you even doing near a dolphin? Don't be near one, ok? Here's how I can prove it is your fault. If you get fucked by a dolphin. No matter what. OK? If I got fucked by a dolphin. Now, like... right now during this show. On the stage. If a dolphin squeaked out from under the curtain. Flipped on over to me, knocked me over and laid me out. Everybody in this room would be like: "- That was definitely not his fault." "- What an unfortunate turn of events." How did they even get this far inland? You'd have so many questions. Rightfully so. Ok? But if I got fucked in the ocean by a dolphin, ...you know. Like where dolphins always only are. Some of you might be like: "- maybe it was what he was wearing." Like, you don't know. Dolphins are just like: "- Damn, how did he fit all that in them swim trunks!? "- That Delia boy is thicker in real life." I can't wait to do that joke until there is somebody in the audience... That has been fucked by a dolphin. And you can tell you know because your like: "- I don't know." "- like not everything is a joke, you know?" "- My uncle was a dolphin and..." "- He slit his fins after he heard that joke, sooo. Not cool, ok?" I don't always do that dolphin slitting his fins part. Because, I feel like sometimes the crowd is too sensitive. But sometimes I do the dolphin slitting his fins part. Because the crowd is too sensitive. Like when I was in Boulder, Colorado "Hey, they're fucking pussies!" Yup, they're big pussies! Dude. I did that joke in Boulder, Colorado. Two nights in a row I was there, ok? And when I got to the dolphin slitting his fins part. Both nights when I got to that part. A huge portion of the audience goes like this: "- Hu hu, Ahhh" That's the best because you don't need to feel bad about something, that is literally never happened in the history of the world. Imagine being that far up your Rockie Mountain ass! That your like: "- You know what, that's where I the line!" "- Dolphin suicide." "- Because my uncle was a dolphin and he tried to hang himself." "- Luckily, dolphins don't have chins, so..." "- He kept slipping and falling." "- He tried like twenty five times, then got tired and gave up" How can you be mad at something that's never happened ever!? And also can't happen. That's hilarious. What fuck is going on in Boulder? Is it like... The dolphins are on top of buildings, like... "- Fuck this." Yah, that's what I'm saying. So anyway, I told her. "What the fuck!?" Yeah. "- Yeah you know, I put it through college and that's the thanks I...." "- What the...!?"" "- They do this!?" Or there's a dolphin in his garage. "- What the...?" Door closed. In his Honda Civic with the window up. Fucking exhaust hose inside, just like. "- Goodbye Sea World." Dude. What kind of fucking crime scene would that be? Yes, hilarious. Does the Boulder P.D. shows up? Just like: "- Alright, so what do we got?" The cop's a starfish. "- Who was first on the scene? What do we think happened here?" Some crab's in the corner just like: "- Hey, Sgt. Starfish, it seems like," we got here earlier and pretty much deduced that there was some foul play involved" This fucking Sgt. Starfish is like: "- Nah, it' not foul play." "- Something's fishy here." "What do you think of this, Sgt. Starfish?" "- Well, did any of you numb-skulls check the corner here for evidence?" "- The dolphin left a note." "- Well, what does it say, Sgt. Starfish?" "- Well, let's take a look here." "- Bag this in evidence! Another case closed by Sgt. Starfish." Yeah man. Nah but it's a weird world we live in man. Everyone is offended at something. It's so fucking weird, you know. Like, people say... People love saying like: "- It's a bad time for comedy." Dude. Fuck that, it's the best time for comedy man. It really is. It's the best! It's so great man. People trying to catch me all... They try to catch comedians all the time. Like TMZ. They'd be at the airport when I get there and they'd be like: "- Hey, Chris Delia, what do you think? What's going on?" "- What do you know?" It's always the wackiest guy. "- Hey Chris, what's going on, what do you think?" "- What do you think about Louis CK? What do you think?" I'm just: "Man you fucking, you say it! I'm not getting into trouble." It's the truth man it's... Like, I feel it every day. I'll tweet something that I don't even think it's a big deal. I'll be just like: "What's up with fashion?" "It's kinda bullshit lately, huh?" And somebody would write back something like: "- Fucking die!" You know like, I'm like. "Oh I don't know, you know." Look, you can get mad at somebody for saying something. But you can't tell them not to say it. 'Cause then if you are not careful, the stuff we can say becomes more and more narrow. And then, pretty soon before you know it if your not careful you end up going to see a comedian and he'll be just like doing the sounds of some shit. He'd be on stage just like: "- EE OHN AH AH OHN, BOY YOING YOING AHOOHGA!" And people from Boulder will be like: "- That's so true!" Right? It's so weird to get mad at a comedian for what we say. It's actually the weirdest. Do you know why? We're joking. We made the whole thing up, ok? We didn't mean it. But this is the best part about that to me. You paid us to say it! Do you know how fucked up that is? Here's how you really realize how fucked up it is. Imagine it all sped up. Like, it usually takes time to get offended at a comedian at his show. You buy the ticket a month in advance and your like: "- I can't wait to see it." You watch a show. During the whole show your just: "- Ha ha ha ha." You know? And then they say one thing. And your like: "- I don't know about the one part, but..." Then you leave. Your in a good mood and you get home. Fall asleep, you wake up the next day, your like: "- That one thing bothers me." BLOG, right? That's how it happens. But imagine it all sped up. Imagine you can walk up to a comedian and go like: "- Hey comedian, I'd like for you to say something." "- Here's some of my money for you to say it." And the comedian like: "- Ok, blah blah." And then your like: "- You know what, go fuck yourself." Some people like getting offended. They do. By the way, it's bullshit for the real victims out there. But some people just want to ride that train and they want apologies. Dude, I worked it out to this. I will never apologize for some shit I say on stage, ever. Ok? It's our job as comedians to push the envelope in a funny way. If we don't, then we don't know where the line is, and then the comedy is going to be corny as shit. Sometimes it up to us to do a joke that we think is funny. But technically it's like a racist joke. Ok? And you know what? We'll do it anyway. And sometimes not only will the audience not laugh, But they'll literally be like: "- Nah!" And then we gotta double up and be like: "- Uh-huh, swear to God!" We can't bitch out and be like: "- Just kidding, black people don't take too long to cross the crosswalk." They fucking do! And if you think that's racist, and not funny. Go fuck yourself! Alright? Listen, I'd rather be a strong racist than a bitch-ass mother fucker. Hey, and that's not true. Do you know why? Because it was a joke, you see how it works? Black people don't take long too cross the crosswalk... What!? Can you get canceled because of a face you make? Well black people, they don't... Black people, everyone knows that if you lined all the races up, and you had them all cross the street, that everyone would be tied. Black people wouldn't come in last. What!? "- You made a fucking face!" Ah man, fuck apologizing for comedy man. I've listened to way too much Tupac to apologize for this comedy. You know you laugh, but you can learn something from a guy like Tupac. Right? He had so much confidence. That's the thing. If you have that much confidence, that people will just buy that that's you, and they're not going to change your mind. Alright? Like, I don't have that much confidence. I am working towards it, but sometimes in the face of adversity, I would fold, immediately. Especially in a casual setting. Like, if I'm at a party and if somebody brings up some real shit, They're like: "- Hey, you know what's bad? Abortion." I'd be like: "Ahh, yah." Whatever gets me out of this conversation the quickest. And then right away somebody could come up to both of us and be like: "- Hey, you know what's awesome, abortion." And I'd be like: "- Ahh, good point." I don't have that much confidence. Everybody knows somebody with that much confidence. You know who has that much confidence? Your Grandpa, that's who has that much confidence. Grandpas are way too old to give a shit about anything. That's why they say crazy shit, and you let them get away with it. And they do too, they'd be like: "- Fuck the air, you don't need it." And you'd be like: "- Ahhh." "- He's going to die soon right? Fuck it" It's the truth, when was the last time you heard a ninety year old be like: "- Huh, I never thought about it that way." You haven't! They've thought about it all the ways. Do you know how I know grandpas have the most confidence? And how they just don't give a fuck? 'Cause here's why, ok. One time I was at my friend's house, on the couch, with my friend's grandpa. Alright? Now, my friend's grandpa shit his pants. OK? I noticed him shit his pants. He noticed me, notice him, shit his pants. And then he looked at me, and he goes like this: "- Naaah" Hey, that's the most confidence! Shitting your pants and then leaving it there! That's truly not giving a fuck. A lot of gangsters say: "- Yah, I don't give a fuck." You'd go home if you shit your pants! 'Cuz! You'd go home in the middle of a drive-by man. You know what I mean, just like, Just like: "- Yo, player." "- You all ready for what's about to go down tonight dog?" "- Ain't nothing going to get in the way of this happening." The best part about this joke is you know how it's going to end. "- Yo, player." "- We been plotting and planning this drive-by for nine fucking months dog." "- And now this dude ain't nothing but five blocks away player." "- Ain't nothing gonna stop this from happening tonight." "- Buckle up, here the fuck we go dog." "- Nothing but four blocks away." "- I can't believe this dude killed my whole family man." "- My mom's dieing breath, she looked at me she said:" "- You better make sure that nothing going to get in the way of this happening." "- So I made a promise to my mother, that's how I know, ain't nothing going to get in the way of this happening tonight." "- Nothing but three blocks away player." "- We gotta make this happen tonight, because I'm moving to Europe tomorrow." "- So nothing going to get in the way of this happening tonight." "- Nothing but two blocks away dog." "- Ya all better cock them guns!" "- Hell ya, that's a lot of guns." "- But that's because I do not want to miss." "- Because ain't nothing going to get in the way of this happening tonight." "- Nothing but one block away, here the fuck we go! Uh oh!" "- Open the windows, listen." "- Something has stopped this from happening." Look, it's a shit joke and I'm glad you liked it. I'm trying to make a point here. Alright? If you have that much confidence. And people would just believe what you say. They would follow you, you could be a leader. Alright? Let me paint a picture ok? If I was in Ikea. Alright? And it was really crowded and I shit my pants. Like really loud so everybody heard. You know? If it just came out. And everyone looked at me, and then I looked back at everyone else And I went: "I don't know." Alright? People would be like: "- That guy's probably from Boulder, ok." But if I was in a Ikea and it was really crowded, and I shit myself really loud. And everyone looked at me, and then I looked back at everyone else and I said: "This is what the fuck we're doing from now on!" A few guys would do it with me next time. That's all I'm saying. A lot of people have diminished they're unapologetic attitude that they used to have, man. You gotta have a little of that man. You gotta have to have all of that unapologetic shit. You don't have to have all of it, Tupac had a lot of it. He start a song with that unapologetic shit. He'd start a song, it be like: "- I fucked your bitch." And you'd be like: "- I should probably check on my girlfriend." And you didn't even know him personally. It's about standing for something. I think. I don't even know. I don't know because I haven't had to stand for shit. I told you, I've had a easy life. I am a white guy, you can just kinda coast. But I read an article recently that changed my perspective on things. It was about Tupac and when he got shot in Las Vegas. And they interviewed the cop that came up on the scene, and found Tupac with a body full of bullet holes. The cop looked down at Tupac and said: "- Hey Tupac, who shot you?" The close and personal crime. "- Let us know what happened before you pass out into a coma." And Tupac looked up at the cop and goes like this: "- Fuck you." For real, that really happened. Not in movie with Matt Damon, for real. A guy stared in the face of death looked to a dude with a badge on and said: "- I know what you want me to do but instead of that." "- Fuck you!" That shit is amazing, now, I read this at Starbucks and I was like: "Oh, I have to change my life." "Fuck you?" "Fuck you!" "Fuck you!" Those were his last words. To a cop. I'm a way more pussy than that. If I even see a cop walking down the street. I feel so guilty, I feel I like should start admitting shit just in case. Be like: "- Excuse me officer, just so you know." "One time when I was 16, I jerked off in my friend's pool." If I ever got shot. No, you know what? That's my whole point. I'll never get shot. I don't matter that much. Tupac got shot because he was starting to matter. Abe Lincoln got shot, he was trying to change history. John Lennon got shot, he was trying to change the world. If I got shot, I'd have no idea why. That's sad to me. I'd have to ask the guy who did it. He'd be like: "- Chris Delia?" "Yes" "Why?" "- That was for growling at my baby!" You guys are great! Thank you very much! Hey you guys. I just want to thank you so much man. It felt great. You guys killed it, and I had such a great time. I want to take a few shots with all of you. Is that okay? Alright great My buddy Troy here is going to take some shots. Just what you want to do. If you are happy, fucking show it. Thank you, Minneapolis, your the fucking best. Thank you, thank you so much.
