Carlo, the supreme Emperor, is nothing but mute dust. His proud soul now lies trembling at the feet of his divine Creator. He sought to rule the world but forgot Him who fixes the stars in their celestial courses. His pride was boundless, his fault grievous. Carlo, the supreme Emperor, is nothing but mute dust. God alone is great; at His will heaven and earth tremble. God alone is great! at His will heaven and earth tremble. Merciful God, who shows pity to sinners, grant that peace and forgiveness descend on him from heaven! God alone is great! I lost her! Oh supreme power! My very own father! The king himself The one I adore has been taken away from me! My betrothed! Ah! how pure and splendid was the day the day without tomorrow, when, drunk with hope we could wander in the shadow, alone together over the sweet land of France in the forest of Fontainebleau! I saw her and her smile opened a new heaven for me! Ah!now a father, a King has separated us forever The sad dawn of my life holds no promise of a happy day... You, my enchantress, have stolen My heart, my hope, my dreams...and my love! You have stolen my heart, my hope, my dreams...and my love! Alas! I have lost her! The sorrows of the earth still follow you in the cloister Only heaven can bring peace to your heart His voice!...My heart trembles... I thought-how terrible! I saw the emperor Who conceals in his habit his crown and his golden breastplate They say that he still appears in the cloister Heaven shall bring peace to your heart. Oh, terror!...Oh, terror! It is he!...the Infante himself! O my Rodrigo! Your Highness! Is it really you I embrace? Oh, my prince, my lord! Heaven has sent you, you angel of solace! The hour has struck, the Flemish people call you! You must help them: be their savior! But what do I see!How pale, how troubled! A flash of pain appears in your eyes. You are silent...you sigh.Your heart is sad. My Carlos, share with me your tears, your sorrow! My saviour, my brother, my faithful friend.. Let me cry on your bosom Pour into my heart your cruel sorrow... Don't close your heart to me! Speak! You wish it? Then learn of my misery... of the mortal shaft that has pierced I love... with a guilty love... Elisabetta! Your step mother! Good Heavens! You turn pale! Woe is me.Even you.. Rodrigo, you turn away from me? No!... no, Rodrigo loves you still.I swear it to you... You suffer?Then the whole universe is nothing to me! - Oh, my Rodrigo! - My prince! Has the king discovered your secret yet? No! Then obtain permission to leave for Flanders. Silence your heart-your deed will be worthy of you Among an opressed people, learn how to become king! I will follow you, brother Listen!The doors of the monastery are opening Filippo and the queen will soon appear. Elisabetta! By my side, streghten your wavering spirit Your star still shines serenely in the sky Pray Heaven to give you the valor of the strong! God, you who have instilled love and hope into our souls Let our hearts burn with the desire for freedom. Together let us swear to live and die together On earth as in Heaven, your goodness will unite us let our hearts burn with the desire for freedom They are coming Oh terror! The mere sight of her makes me tremble! Take heart! Carlos the supreme emperor.. He has made her his own! Is nothing more than silent ashes - I have lost her! - His haughty soul now trembles - at the feet of his heavenly maker - I have lost her! - Ah! Great God! - Come close to me - He has made her his own! - Your heart will be strong Together we shall live, together we shall die Our last breath will be... one cry: Freedom! Together we shall live, together we shall die! Our last breath will be... Freedom! Beneath the dense, immense firs which offer a gentle screen of shade and tranquility to the holy dwelling, let us take shelter and let the fresh breeze bring solace from the burning sun The ground is covered with a mass of flowers One can hear the rustling of the pines and beneath the shade the nightingale seems to take the flight more merrily Delightful is to hear among the trees the love-fond fountain murmur of its sorrows drop by drop! And, if the sun is scorching to beguile the daylight hours amid the shade and among the flowers... Within these sacred walls, the queen of Spain alone may enbter. Would you like, my companions... since the stars have not appeared in the sky, to sing a few songs? We will follow your whim, o, princess, we shall listen attentively. Bring me the mandolinn, and let us all sing. Let us sing the Saracen song, the one about the veil, favorable to love Let's sing! In the garden of the beautiful Moorish palace.. among the perfume and the shade of the laurels and the flowers A beautiful alma, all covered by a veil seems to be gazing at a star in the sky Mohammed, the Moorish king wanders into the garden He says to her:"I adore you, o gentle beauty Come, the king invites you to reign with him; I no longer desire the queen" Weave your veils, fair maidens, While the sun shines in the sky, For, when the stars are bright, veils are most favorable to love But I barely can see you the sky is dark your lovely hair, your little hand, your foot pray, raise the veil that hides you from me like the sky, without a veil you must be If you will give your heart to me, You will have my throne, for I am the king You wish it? Bend down, I'll do as you ask. Allah! The queen!?. Mohammed exclaimed. Weave your veils, fair maidens, While the sun shines in the sky, For, when the stars are bright, veils are most favorable to love. The queen! (A secret sadness weighs upon her heart) A happy song resounded here. Alas!Gone are the days when my heart was happy The Marquis of Posa, Grandee of Spain. Madam!For your Majesty, your venerable mother entrusted a letter to me in Paris. Read it, in the name of eternal grace! Here is the royal seal, the golden fleur-de lys. What is the news from France, a land so noble and so courteous? There is a talk of a great tournament in which the King will take part (Ah! I dare not... French women are so gracious (I dare not open it..) - And known for their elegance and grace If I'll do it, I will betray the king's honor In you alone one sees grace and beauty sparkle together Is it true that at royal festivities (My soul is still pure) French women are so beautiful that only in heaven can their equal be found? The loveliest lady may well be absent from them Tell me, is it true? God sees my heart At court balls, for our cloaks are silk and gold embroidery fashionable? "By the memory that unites us, in the name of a past which I cherish All is well when one has your grace and your beauty I am grateful. Ask a favour of the queen.. I accept but not for me. (I can hardly bear it!) Who is worthier than you to see his wishes fulfilled? (Ah! I tremble!) Tell me, who? Who, indeed? Carlo, who has our only love, lives forlorn in this land. And noone knows the depth of grief that is withering the fair flower of his heart.. The hope of him who mourns lies in you Let him find peace and strenght; allow him to see you again; If he shall return, he will be saved. (One day, when I was at his mother's side, I saw the Infante tremble at my glances, and go pale!) Could he be in love with me?.. Alas!I can scarcely bear it! May he be allowed to see you again O, God, to see him again is to die! Why does he hide it from me? If he returns he will be saved. The Infante Carlos always found the heart of his father the King closed: and yet, who on earth would be more worthy to be loved? A loving word would bring strength and peace to this tender heart. Deign to see him, deign to hear him! Rescue the Infante! Rescue Carlos! If he shall return, he will be saved. Oh, I'm ready to see my son again. (Will he dare? If only he could open his heart to me!) I come to ask a favor of my queen. She who holds the first place in the King's heart... ...alone can obtain this favor for me The air of this land is fatal for me, it opresses, it tortures me Like the thought of a misfortune. I must leave!It is necessary! Ask the king to send me to Flanders. My son! Not that name..!But the one you called me once! I am wretched!I cand bear it no more! Have pity!I have suffered so much! MIserly heaven granted me only one day, and then took it away! Prince, if Philip wishes to hear my prayer you may leave tomorrow for Flanders which he will entrust to your hands. Heaven!Not a word, not a single word for the wretched who goes into exile! Ah! why do I not hear.. the voice of pity in your heart? Alas! my soul is opressed, A chill enters my heart! Insane, I cried and prayed in my delirium I appealed to the icy marble of a tomb Why do you accuse my heart of indifference? You should understand my noble silence Duty shone before my eyes like a ray of light Guided by that ray I shall proceed. I put my hope in God, in my innocence Oh, lost love, my only treasure Ah, you, splendor of my life At least I hear your voice once again.. your word opens the doors of heaven for me! schiuder si vede il ciel! Merciful God, may his noble heart Appease his sorrows in oblivion; Oh Carlos, farewell, living next to you on this earth I would consider myself in heaven! A miracle!My heart gains hope and consolation the memory of grief flies away Heaven has felt pity for so much pain Isabella, I would die of love at your feet Merciful Heavens, life has faded from his lack-lustre eye. Divine charity, restore, I pray his noble heart that has suffered so. Alas, sorrow is killing him.. the man heaven destined for me die of anguish, die of love! What voice descends to me from the sky to speak of love?.. Elisabeth! you...my beloved. He is delirious, how terrible! Seated next to me, as I once saw you Ah! the sky brightens, the forest blooms again... Oh terror!He is dying! Ah, it is you, my beloved - Great God! My sweet love!Is it you!The one that I adore! Merciful Heaven! From my tomb, from the sleep of the grave Why do you want to take me away, pitiless heaven! Carlo! Let the heart open under my foot. Let my head be struck by lightning. I love you, Elisabeth!... And the world has ceased to exist for me! Accomplish your task, go and slay your father And then, stained with his blood you can lead your mother to the altar Go, slay your father! Ah!I'm accursed! God has watched over us! O, Lord! The king! Why is the queen alone? Did you not instruct at least one of your ladies to remain near you? Do you ignore my royal law? Which lady-in-waiting was to be with you? Countess, you will return to France at dawn! Ah! What an insult to the Queen! Do not weep, my companion, Soothe your sorrow.. You have been driven out of Spain, But not out of my heart. My childhood days were passed joyfully with you! Return to our native land, my heart will follow you. Take this last token, this token of all my regard. Keep to yourself the outrage which makes me blush. Do not talk of my tears nor my cruel sorrow Return to our native land my heart will follow you. my heart will follow you. Stay! Why have you still not asked to appear before me? I know how to reward those who protect me; I know that you served my crown faithfully What could I hope to obtain from the favor of king Sire, I am content, the law is my shield. I like a proud spirit... I forgive audacity...not always... You have left the profession of arms Can a man like you, a soldier of noble birth, remain idle? Whenever Spain needs a sword, A defender, a guardian of its honor, my sword, stained with blood will shine! I know it well...but what can I do for you? Nothing for me, but for others... What do you mean?For others? I will speak, Sire...if you will bear it. Speak! My lord, I have returned from Flanders, that country once so beautiful. Now deprived of his light, it inspires horror, like a silent grave The orphan without a home wanders through the streets, weeping Arms and fire destroy everything, and pity is banished The river seems to flow red with blood; One hears the echo of a mother who cries for the death of her children I thank God.. for allowing me to tell of this cruel agony so that it may be known to the king! By blood alone may I obtain peace for the world My sword has supressed the pride of the reformers who deceive the people with false hopes... Death in my hands has a fertile future. Do you believe that by sowing death to plant for eternity? Look at Spain! The artisan in the cities, the peasant in the fields, faithful to God and the king they do not complain The same peace I give to my Flanders! A horrible peace! The peace of the tomb! O king, may history never say of you: He was a Nero! Is this the peace you give to the world? A gift like this brings terror! The priests are hangmen, the soldiers thugs! The people weep and die in silence; your empire is a desert where Filippo's name is cursed! Renew the whole globe like a redeeming God soar upwards to sublime heights, above every other monarch! Let the world rejoice because of you! Grant it freedom! What a strange dreamer you are! You will think differently when you know the hearts of men as well as Filippo knows them! Enough! No more! The King heard none of this! No, you need not be afraid! But beware of the Grand Inquisitor! What? Sire! You stay in the King's presence and still have no favour to ask of him? I want you at my side! Sire, no! I want to stay the man I am. You are too proud! Your gaze has dared to penetrate my throne... Hear, then, of the grief and anguish that torment the head that bears the heavy weight of the crown! Look at my palace, shrouded in worry... A pitiful father! A still more pitiful husband! What do you mean? The Queen... A suspicion haunts me... - My son... - His soul is proud and pure! Nothing under the sun equals the prize he has stolen from me! Be their judge and my support! Sound out these hearts which a crazy love carries away! You have full authority to speak to the Queen! You, who alone are a man among humankind! Ah! What a dawn lightens the sky! In your hands!- It is open, this heart which has never been opened! May this happy day bring peace to my heart! O my divine hope! O my glorious dream! Beware of my Inquisitor! Beware! Sire! "At midnight, in the Queen's gardens, ''under the laurels, near the fountain ?" It is midnight! I hear the clear sound of the spring amid the silence. Drunk with love, full of an immense joy, Elisabeth! My dear, my happiness ? I await you! It is you, my beloved, stepping among these flowers! It is you! My enchanted soul sees its sorrows fly away. O sacred, boiling spring of my sweetest happiness, of my cherished sadness, my dear, my love, it is you! (Such a love is the greatest happiness! It is sweet to be so loved!) Let us forget the universe, life and heaven itself! What matters the past? What matters the future? I love you! May love unite your heart with mine for all eternity! Forget the world, forget this life, forget heaven itself! I love you! - (Utmost joy!) (God, it is not the Queen!) Why have you turned so pale and still? Your lips are as cold as ice! What ghost has come between us? Do you not believe my heart that beats for you alone? Do you not know what dreadful trap has been set for you? At any moment, a thunderbolt may strike your head! I know the storm clouds are gathering over me. The thunderbolt that waits to strike me is always before my eyes! I heard your father and Posa talking of you in ominous tones. Rodrigo! I can save you. I love you! What secret have I uncovered here? I can save you. I love you! Ah, Carlo! You have the heart of an angel, but mine must be forever closed to happiness! We dreamed a strange dream, you and I, in this sweet night, between the perfumed flowers. A dream! The words you spoke were for another ear! What a revelation! What a secret! You love the Queen! - Have pity! What did he say? He is mad, do not believe him! I saw love in his heart, he has given himself away! What do you mean? I know everything! What do you mean? Tremble, you wretch! I am... You are the King's confidant, I know But I am a dangerous enemy. I know your power, but you do not yet know mine. Say plainly what you mean! - Nothing. It will do you no good to flee my rage. I hold his life in my hands! Then speak and tell us what brought you here! When a tigress's heart is wounded the insult demands revenge! The wrath of heaven, which protects the innocent, will strike you down! What a fool I have been! Oh cruel fate! I have tainted my mother's name! God alone knows When a tigress's heart is wounded that my heart is innocent! ...the insult demands revenge! And to think I trembled before her! She draped her heart in virtue, played the saint, to drink her fill of lust and wallow in love! By God, she is shameless! I shall kill you on the spot! Rodrigo! No, the venom has not yet been spewed from her accursed lips! Rodrigo, restrain yourself! Does your hand waver? No! - Strike now! - No! Here I am! No, I still have one hope left to me. God will guide me! Fear for your life, false son, my vengeance will find you! Fear for your life, the abyss will soon yawn at your feet! Have pity on his pain... She knows everything! If you talk, may a severe God raise his arm to punish you! Hold your tongue or the abyss will soon yawn at your feet! Woe betide you, soon the earth will open up to swallow you! Carlo, if you have any important letter, any news, any secret, entrust it to me! To you! The King's confidant! Do you distrust me? Me? No, you are my heart's dearest hope! I could not close it to you if I tried! I shall put all my trust in you. Yes, I will give you these precious letters. Carlo, you can trust me! My life is in your hands! The day of joy has come at last, glory to the greatest of all kings! The nations trust in him, the world lies prostrate at his feet! Our love goes with him everywhere and such a love will never diminish! His name is the pride of Spain, may he live forever! The day has come, the day of wrath, the frightful, fateful day! They shall die! God's stern judgment is just! Yet excommunication can be followed by the divine voice of forgiveness, if the sinner repents in his final hour. Glory to the King! He will live in eternity! The nations trust in him, the world lies prostrate at his feet! Glory to the King! Open the church gates! O House of God, open to us! Sacred shrine, give to us our King! Open the church gates! Sacred shrine, give to us our King! Sacred shrine, give to us our King! When I set this crown upon my head, I swore to heaven to punish the guilty by fire and the sword! Glory to the King! Glory to God! (Carlo! Oh God!) (What is he doing here?) Who are these men kneeling at my feet? They are envoys from Brabant and Flanders, whom your son presents to the King. Sire, Sire, No, Flander's last hour has not yet struck in spite of all she suffers. An entire nation implores you: do not let our tears and sighs last forever! If in this church your heart begged for mercy and for peace, then have pity on us, then have pity on us, spare our land, o King, for your power comes from God! You have been unfaithful to God and your King! Flanders rebelled against me. Guards, take them away! They are disloyal! Stretch out your royal hand to shelter them! You have been unfaithful to God! - They have no faith in God! Have pity on poor suffering Flanders in her death throes! You have been unfaithful to your King! Away from me! You have been unfaithful to God and your King! -Away from me! Have pity on poor suffering Flanders You have been unfaithful to God! You have been unfaithful to your King!- Away from me! Away from me! You have been unfaithful to God and your King! Sire, it is time I learned to live. I am tired of being hidden away in this country. If it is God's will that I should one day wear your crown, then raise a King worthy of Spain! Entrust me with Brabant and Flanders! Are you mad? How dare you make such a demand! Shall I myself hand you the sword that will one day strike the King? God knows our hearts, he must be the judge! (I tremble!) - (He is lost!) I swear by God, I alone will be your saviour, people of Flanders! To draw his sword before the King! The Infante has lost his mind! Guards, disarm him! My lords, upholders of my throne, disarm him! What? Will no one? Who dares try? Who can escape this sword? Disarm him! Give me your sword! God in heaven! Rodrigo! You! Rodrigo! He! Posa! (He!) Marquis, I hereby dub you Duke. Now to the fiesta! The day of joy has come at last, glory to the greatest of all kings! The nations trust in him, the world lies prostrate at his feet! The day of wrath has come. Fly up to heaven, you piteous souls! V'affrettate a goder la pace del Signor! You shall find solace... - And you look on, o heaven? in the peace of the Lord! - God does not put out these flames! The tyrant kindles the pyre's flame in the name of the Lord! - Glory to God! - God allows these sacrifices! She has never loved me! No, her heart is closed to me, she does not love me. I still recall how shocked she was by my white hair when she arrived from France. No, she does not love me! Where am I? The lamps have almost burned out! Dawn casts its pale light on my balcony. It is daybreak! The days of my life are ebbing away! Oh God, sleep evades my tired eyes. I shall sleep alone in my royal mantle when the evening of my life draws near. I shall asleep alone in that gloomy vault, the crypt of the Escorial! If only the crown could give me the power to see into men's hearts, as God alone can! When the monarch sleeps, the traitor is alert; the King loses his crown, the husband his honour! I shall sleep alone in my royal mantle when the evening of my life draws near. I shall asleep alone in that gloomy vault, the crypt of the Escorial! If only the crown could give me the power to see into men's hearts... She has never loved me! No, her heart is closed to me, she does not love me. The Grand Inquisitor! Am I in the presence of the King? Yes, I sent for you, Father! I have doubts! Carlo fills my heart with grief. He has rebelled against me, he has taken up arms against his father! What punishment do you wish to see inflicted? The very harshest! And that would be? Either exile... or the axe... Well? If I condemn him to death, will you grant me absolution? The life of a rebel is a small price to pay for peace within the empire. May a Christian sacrifice his son for the world? God sacrificed His to redeem us! Can such a harsh law hold here? It holds everywhere since it held on the cross! Can I stifle the voice of love and nature? In the name of faith, you must stifle everything! Very well! Is there another matter the King wishes to address? No. Then I must raise it, Sire. Heresy has never been tolerated in Spain, but one man seeks to undermine the divine order: the King's friend, your faithful companion, a fiend who is tempting you on to ruin! Carlo's treachery is a trifling matter compared to his. And I, the Inquisitor who have so often raised my fist against shadowy heretics, now ignore my faith to please earthly princes. I have let a rebel go free... and the King! I could not find at court the one thing I longed for to help me through these grim times. A man! An honest heart! And then I found one. A man? What for? Why are you called the King if a mere man is your equal? Enough, priest! The reformers' ideas have infected your mind! You think your weak hand can break the holy yoke that rests upon the Roman Catholic world! Return to your duty. The Church can forgive those who truly repent. Hand the Marquis of Posa over to me! No, never! Sire, if I were not with you in this palace now, then, by God, tomorrow you would stand before the highest court of the Inquisition! Priest, I have listened to your cruel words too long! Then why do you evoke the shade of Samuel? I have already given this mighty empire two kings! Do you want to destroy all that we have achieved? It is madness! Why am I here? What does Your Majesty want from me? Father, let us make peace again. Peace? Forget what has been said here! Perhaps! It is always the way, the throne must bow before the altar! Justice, Sire! I trust in the King's integrity! I am cruelly treated at court, unknown enemies commit vile outrages against me! My casket where I keep my treasures, my jewels... and other things still dearer to me... has been stolen! I demand justice from your Majesty! Is this what you are looking for? God in heaven! Won't you open it? Very well, I shall! (I cannot bear it!) Carlo's portrait! Words appear to fail you. Carlo's portrait! Yes. Among your jewels? Yes. What? You dare admit it? Yes, indeed I dare! You know my hand was first promised to your son. Now I am yours, obedient to God's will, and as chaste as the lilies. Yet someone dares to doubt Elisabetta's honour! And the man who delivers that insult... is the King! Oh, bold words! You think me weak, you think you can provoke me. My weakness can quickly turn to anger. Tremble, then, for yourself and for me! What have I done? - Liar! If dishonour has been heaped on dishonour if you have been unfaithful to me, then I swear by God that blood will flow! I pity you! The pity of an adulteress! Ah! Come to the Queen's aid! (God in heaven, what have I done!) Sire, half the world is subject to you. You control a vast empire, yet it seems you cannot control yourself. (Damn this ruinous suspicion, whispered in my ear by a fiend from hell!) (I have ruined her! My remorse is agonising!) (She has not betrayed her marriage vow!) (I have committed a hellish crime!) (Her pride disclose it to me!) - (I have ruined her!) At last the time for action has come, a terrible thunderbolt has split the sky.) (A man must die for Spain... to secure her future happiness!) (She has not betrayed her marriage vow!) - (I have betrayed this noble heart!) (She was not unfaithful to me!) - (O remorse!) What happened? Oh, heavens! They have all abandoned me... (O remorse!) - to tears and grief! I am a stranger in this land! (Bitter sadness!) - I have lost all hope in this world! Have mercy! Have mercy on a repentant sinner! At my feet? You? What have you done? Remorse is killing me, my heart is in torment! Angel of heaven, illustrious Queen, learn what devil hell gave you over to! Your casket! I was the thief! - You! I! I was your accuser! - You! Love, rage, my hatred of you... cruel jealousy, all these drove me to act against you! I love Carlo and he rejected me! You love him? Rise. No! No, I have more to confess! More? Have pity on me! The King... Oh, do not curse me! Yes... seduced... dishonoured... The crime I accused you of... I... myself.. committed it! Give me my cross! You will leave the court tomorrow You may choose between exile and a convent. Alas, I shall never see the Queen again! What a destructive, cruel gift heaven gave me in its rage! A curse on that which makes us vain and proud, a curse on my loveliness! All I can do is weep tears, all my hopes are lost! My crime is so terrible that I can never atone for it! A curse on my loveliness! O my Queen, I sacrificed you to the mad folly of my heart! I shall bury my anguish in a convent and hide it from the world! Alas! O mia Regina in a convent.. Oh, God! Carlo! He goes to his death tomorrow! I still have one day left, hope is on my side! Thanks be to heaven! I shall save him! It is me, my dear Carlo! I am so grateful to you for visiting me in this dungeon! My Carlo! You know I have no strength left! My love for Elisabetta torments and devours me! I am of no more use to the living! But you can still save them, put an end to their slavery! You know how much I love you! You must escape from this dreadful tomb! I am happy just to embrace you one more time! I have saved you! What are you saying? We must part, dear Carlo! My last day has come, we shall never see each other again. May God, who rewards his faithful servants, reunite us in heaven. There are tears in your eyes. Why are you so sad? No, take heart! For the man who dies for you, the final breath will be a joyful one. Why do you talk of death? Listen, time is short, I have made myself the target of the vengeful thunderbolt. You are no longer the King's adversary... the man stirring up revolt in Flanders is me! No one will believe it! The evidence is overwhelming! Your letters, which were found in my possession, are clear proof of rebellion. A price has already been set on my head, I am sure. I shall tell the King everything! No, save yourself for Flanders! You must finish the great work I began! You will usher in a new golden age! Your destiny is to rule and someone must die! God in heaven! You speak of death! But whose? Mine! The King's vengeance could not be delayed for long. Almighty God! Carlo, listen. Your mother expects you tomorrow in San Giusto; she knows everything. I am fading... Dear Carlo, give me your hand! I am dying, but I die happy, knowing my death has saved the saviour of Spain! Do..not... forget me! Do not forget me! Yes, your destiny is to rule and mine is to die for you! I am dying, but I die happy.. Save Flanders! Carlo, farewell! Carlo, take back your sword; Stand back! Your hand is spattered with his loyal blood! He loved me like a brother. He sacrificed himself for me! Oh, my prophetic soul! I am no longer your son! Who can bring this man back to me? The bell rings out a warning! Perir dovr? chi d'arrestarci attenti! We will strike without fear or pity! Tremar ognun dovr?, curvar la testa -Tremble and yield... - The people are in uproar! before the avenging people! - They demand to see the Infante! Open the gates! - Good God! Obey! It is my will! We will strike without fear or pity! Tremble before the people's vengeful anger! What do you want? - L'Infante! -He remains here! - Oh! sacrilegio infame! The Grand Inquisitor! Down on your knees before the King! He is under God's protection! Down with you! Lord, have mercy on us! Glory be to almighty God! Long live the King! - Have mercy on us! Glory be to almighty God! - Long live the King! You who partook of the vanities of this world and now enjoy the profound peace of the tomb: if there is still weeping in heaven, weep for my grief and bring my tears before God's throne! Carlo will come here! Yes! He must go away and learn to forget me... I promised Posa I would watch over him! He must follow his destiny, it will be a glorious one. As for me, my life has already reached its evening. France, you noble land, so dear to me in my youth! Fontainebleau! My thoughts fly to you. There I swore before God an oath of eternal love, though that eternity only lasted a day. You lovely gardens here in Spain, if Carlo should walk in you of an evening, may the lawns, streams, woods and flowers sing of our love in harmony! Farewell, golden dreams and lost illusions! The last tie has been cut, the light extinguished! Farewell, my youth! My heart, in its grief, desires only the peace of the grave! You who knew the emptiness of the pomp of this world, You who enjoy at last a sweet, profound peace, if one sheds tears even in heaven, by weeping bring my tears to the feet of the eternal one! Glorious soul risen to heaven, ah, by weeping bring my tears to the feet of the eternal one! There she is! Just one word! I commend the departing pilgrim to heaven. And then I require just one thing of you: that you forget me and live! Yes, I will try to be strong. But when love shatters, it kills more certainly than death itself. No, think of Rodrigo! He did not sacrifice himself for a mere whim! I will erect for him a splendid tomb in Flanders, more magnificent than that of any King! The flowers of paradise will gladden him! Once I had a dream, a wondrous dream... but it has faded... and in its place I see in agony a flaming bonfire and a stake! A river as red as blood, fields like a graveyard, a nation of dying people, who stretch out their hands to me as if I could save them! I will go to them gladly, whether to death or victory, as long as I am sure of your praise or your tears! Yes, this is the sacred fire of heroism! A love worthy of us, whose flame was lit by a brave man! A love that turns mortals into gods! Do not delay! Go and save a dying nation! These people call me with your voice! Save the people! And if I die for them, my death will be a noble one! Until today no human power could have torn my hand from yours... But on this great day, my honour has vanquished love; a cause like this transforms both heart and spirit! Do you see, Elisabetta... I can clasp you in my arms and my virtue is unshaken! When it is all over and I have withdrawn my hand from yours... now you weep? Yes, I weep, but in admiration. These tears come from my soul, now you can see the tears women shed for heroes! We shall meet again, up above, in a better world, an eternal future has begun for us. In the arms of the Lord we will find the longed-for happiness that eluded us on earth! We shall meet again, up above, in a better world, an eternal future has begun for us. In the arms of the Lord we will find the longed-for happiness that eluded us on earth! On that day that will bring us no more tomorrows, let us forget the names for carnal love! Farewell, mother! My son, farewell! Farewell forever! Forever farewell! Yes, forever! I demand a dual sacrifice! I shall do my duty. And you? The Inquisition will do its duty, too. Heavens! Guards! God will avenge me! His fist will smash this tribunal of blood! Earthly sorrow finds us even in the cloister. The strife in your heart will only find peace in heaven. The voice of Carlo! It is Carlo the Fifth! My father! God in heaven!
