(intense music) (upbeat music) - Are you alone right now? Are you currently between relationships? Have you sunk to the point where you are excited about a date with a total stranger? Huh? Only one thing can save you, can protect you from today's coniving, competitive and occasionally cruel world of courtship, and it's not made a lamb skin or latex. It's a lawyer. A compatibility- (upbeat music) - Hi, how are you? Oh Carter, you're so sweet. (upbeat music) (people chattering) (couple laughing) So. (cheerful music) No. Um, no, wait. - Are you sure? - Yeah, um, look Carter, I think you're a great guy. It's just, you're so sweet, so polite, so nice. Do you think we could be friends? - I, I don't suppose you mean friends as in friends first? - No, I mean just friends. - Huh. - It's safer this way. I mean, if I ever hurt you, I just don't know what I'd do with myself. - Do you believe this shit? (melancholy music) - [Pat] Man, that just me pisses me off. - [Carter] I know, I know, I really liked her. - [Pat] Yeah. Well, where has that ever gotten ya? Dog shit. - [Carter] Yeah, well, what are you gonna do? - [Pat] She should be shot. - [Carter] I don't think we need to go that far. - Hey look, look, look, there she is. You suck! - Take it easy. - Take it easy? Dude, we're teachers. Outside of lotteries and lawsuits, gambling is our only legitimate hope of making any serious cash. - I don't know, maybe we're overlooking something. We need, we need a system. - Yeah, I got your system for ya. No more betting on chick horses or chick jockeys or chick trainers or chick owners or- - I sense something deeper is troubling you. - Yeah well, I hate women. - No you don't. - Oh yes I do. - Oh, and who is it this time who has you dismissing the entire gender? - Oh, fucking Jennifer. 100 bucks on dinner last night. You know what I get? - Hmm. See, I'm guessing something short of a religious sexual experience. - Yeah, a kiss at the door, then thank you and good night. - Well wasn't it your first date? - I don't think you heard me. $100. - Hey, hey, hey, you shouldn't do that. The results aren't official yet. - Dude, our horse ran last. They'd have to disqualify six horses before this ticket would matter. Anyway, I'm never asking Jennifer out again. Next time I drop 100 bucks on a skirt, it's gonna be at the God damn chicken ranch. - [Announcer] Results of the sixth race are now official. Moving towards the winner's circle. - Aw crap. If I'd have had the four horse I'd have won 380 bucks. - Damn, how much did you bet? - 20 Across the board. - $60, plus 100 on dinner last night? Where is all this money coming from? - Credit cards. Hey, they keep sending me applications. It's amazing though what happens when you miss a few payments. How much did you put down? - Uh, two to place. - Whoa. (laughs) Hey, don't hurt yourself, Mr. Vegas. - Hey, I'm saving up for the big bet. - Yeah, whatever. - Yeah, you'll see. - [Pat] What do you say we cut our losses and get another beer? - [Carter] You go ahead. I'm gonna start working on the next race. - [Erin] Hi Carter. - Hello Erin. - You're looking hot. Of course, you always look that way. - Yeah right. - Oh, Susan, my old sorority sister, the one who's finishing law school. She saw your picture and she has been asking about you ever since. So just say the word and I'll set you two up. - Yeah, why are you so anxious to do that? - Because if I can't have you, one of my friends having you is the next best thing. - Okay, so it's a team effort, huh? (Erin laughs) - No, that's another fantasy all together. - Cut it out. Does Chris know you talk to me this way? - Chris knows what I want him to know. - Oh, how convenient. - You know what my mom always says? "If you can find a man" "who you're just a little more clever than," "then you can have your cake and eat it, too." - Really? Just how much cake do you plan on eating? - Call me sometime. (sensual music) I'd love to show you. - Yowza. That is somebody you should definitely look into boning. - Pat, she's my sister. - She's your stepsister. Your former stepsister. Your old man was married to her mom for what, six weeks? - Six months. - Come on. - Well, she still seems like family. - Yeah and this is Kentucky. Shit, they'll bust you for playing rap music before they'll bust for incest. (lively music) ♪ Paint by number in love ♪ (radio beeping) ♪ And I'll let them, show them ♪ (radio beeping) (lively bluegrass music) - No. ♪ Yeehaw ♪ ♪ Na na na na na na ♪ (radio beeping) ♪ Writin' bad checks ♪ ♪ Well I'm writing bad checks ♪ Oh, I got a bad feeling about this. I reckon. I reckon. (chuckles) - Maggie! Oh, I can't believe you did it. I never thought I'd say the day that you would move here. - Yeah, lost a few bets on that one. But the vet school folks are right. If you like horses, this is the place to be. Okay, I can't breathe. - Oh, I am so glad you're here. - Well, you have made that abundantly clear. Oh, here. You want a beer? - Oh, no thank you. I'm uh, watching my calories. - God, you don't need to. Married life is obviously agreeing with you. - So what's up with Matt? Oh, will he be coming to visit you anytime soon? - No. - Oh, what happened? - He wanted to see other people. - And he told you this? - No, I kind of figured it out for myself when I walked in on him with his secretary. She was on her knees, and let's just say, she wasn't praying. - Oh Maggie. Well, there's already someone here who's just dying to meet you. - Oh really? And who might that be? - Only the most eligible bachelor in town. Robert Landler. He is worth millions and he is really, I mean really handsome. - Uh-huh, and how old is he, Kate? - 46. (Maggie laughs) - 46, no, thanks. I'd like someone mature, but not that mature. (both laughing) - Oh, so, should I call him? (calming music) - You must be the new vet. Welcome. - Thank you. And you are? - I'm Rufus, the stallion manager. - Oh, hello. - Pleased to meet you. Um, not to bother you, but I'd like you to come and take a gander at something. - Okay. - So you're a big Kentucky fan, huh? - Only 146 days till basketball season. (Maggie laughs) Pembroke, you know, one of our stallions, he banged up his leg and I think it's just a little cut. I don't think it's nothing serious, but. - Well, let me take a look. That's why I'm on the payroll. (whimsical music) It's just a superficial laceration. - A cut. - Glad to hear that. - Right. (whimsical music) - May I help you? - Maggie, this is my boy, Little Rufus. - Hello there. (whimsical music) - He saw you come in this morning. I think he's sweet on you. (Maggie laughs) (phone ringing) - I should get that. - Okay. See you later. - Vet's office. - Maggie? - Oh, hi Kate. - How's your first day going? - Great, it's great. - [Kate] Glad to hear it. Find any uh, studs around there yet? - (laughs) Only the four-legged kind. - Oh, no cute guys at all? - Oh, let's just say I'm quickly developing an interest in older men. - Hmm. - And romance is a subject the cavalier poets of the early 17th century knew quite well. Now I want you to imagine what might have influenced the likes of Thomas Carew, Richard Loveless and Andrew Marvell. Does anyone have any ideas? - Well, what about dating? I mean, did people go out on dates back then? - Unlikely. If you think about it, dating is a phenomenon unique to the 20th century. It came to exist mainly because the population grew too large and sophisticated for our marriages to be arranged anymore. But the real question is, do you think by not dating, people from the past missed out on some good times? - Are you kidding? Men had nothing but good times in those days. - Uh, excuse me. I seem to recall women having their share of fun as well. I mean, Catherine the Great wasn't exactly the poster child for safe sex. (students laughing) - Suffice it to say, the world we live in today is considerably more complex than the one in which the cavalier poets resided. - That's just it though. I think people as a whole, men and women, were better off before dating was invented. - Why do you say that? - No one played games. Today that's all dating's about. When to call, how long to wait. Lame excuses when someone breaks up with you. - Come on, you guys don't play games with each other, do you? - Well- - Not yet, anyway. Do you? - Mr. Wagner, you have to play games. If you tell a girl you like her, it's like telling her you got herpes. She immediately loses interest. - Or runs away screaming. - Or pretends you don't exist. - That's ridiculous. - Like you've never played hard to get. - Like you would know. - I'd say you're doing it right now. - You're mistaking rejection for flirtation. - [Boy] Did you say erection? - Okay, hey hey hey. - I think she wants you. - Listen up. You do not play games with other people's hearts. Okay, fine, fine, fine. If you feel compelled to play games with other people's emotions, well you go right ahead, but be warned, the gods will get even with you. - [Students] Ooh. - Oh, it won't be obvious at first. It may be something simple like a jammed cassette tape or a skipping CD or a stolen car stereo. But, if none of that convinces you to stop, the gods will visit you with the modern day equivalent of lice, oils and plagues. They'll make you fall in love with someone who plays the games even better than you do. (thunder cracking) (Carter chuckles) - [Voicemail] You have three new messages. - Just listen to some of these satisfied clients. - After my first couple of dates with Jeff, he told me he'd call me one or two times a week. That's just unacceptable. So my lawyer stepped in, and he got me three to five, mandatory. - Things were going great with this girl, then she told me she loved me. I didn't know what to do. I got desperate, so I called my lawyer. - Oh. (chuckles) - [Man] And he helped me end the relationship by saying that she was moving way too fast. - [Man] I was going out for about two months, and she stopped returning my calls. All my stuff was over at her house and I wanted it all back. - [Pat Voicemail] Hey, it's Pat. Barbara called in sick, so I'm with you on the field trip tomorrow. How about that centerfold? Wow. Wow, wow, wow. See ya. (answering machine beeping) - [Erin] Hi, it's Erin. Listen, my rocket scientist of a boyfriend can't seem to figure out how to hook up my stereo. So I thought I'd look up my favorite expert. Call me. - This woman was born in the '80s? Is that even legal? (answering machine beeping) - [Bridget] Carter? It's Bridget, remember me? (chuckles) Guess what? I'm gonna be home for Joe and Molly's wedding next Saturday, and I thought that maybe we could get together. I'll call you when get to town, okay? I can't wait to see you. (answering machine beeping) (horses snorting) (upbeat music) - She's a Pembroke filly out of a mare named In My Cap, and we're confident she'll bring us a big number at the Kealin Select sales next month. Since Pembroke's first crop of two year olds already have three Greater Stakes winners between them, and this filly, she just looks like a winner. She's confident, she's got a well developed hind quarters, and a wonderful disposition. Your typical foal will stand... Once a foal does this... (whimsical music) (head slamming) Okay boys, take her back. Now, if you all uh, follow me to the barn over there, we'll wind up your tour today with a very special surprise. (host laughs) This way. - Special surprise? - Hey, I'll lead the way. (people chattering) - [Host] Both thoroughbreds have the same birthday, and that's January 1st. - Quiet down. - Following their birth. So obviously, the earlier a horse is born in the year, the better, 'cause they'll be physically older and therefore more developed than horses born later in the year. (whimsical music) - Okay. - Oh shit. (whimsical music) Sorry about that. - Was it something I said? I'm Carter Wagner. - Maggie Dahlia. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. So uh, you work here or? - Yeah, just started. - We'll have more than 100 foals this year. A process that begins right here. (horse whinnying) - Wow, is that the stallion? - No, that's the uh, teaser horse. - The teaser horse? - His job is to tease the mare. He uh, nuzzles her, nibbles her, basically turns her on. That way we make sure she'll be ready for the stallion. - Wait a minute, are you saying this horse does all the groundwork and another guy comes in and seals the deal? - Basically, yes. - Sounds to me like he's the one who's being teased. (gate slamming) - Well, you might say the most a teaser and the mare could ever be is just good friends. - [Boys] That sucks. (people chattering) - [Pat] Hey now, come on you guys, let's behave. (horse neighing) - I thought if horses got sick you just shot 'em. (Maggie laughs) - Only the ones who are really sick. - I think a few of the ones I bet on recently fall into that category. - Ah, haven't cashed a ticket in a while? - That's putting it mildly. - Yeah, I know how you feel. I had more than a few of my own frustrating moments before I discovered the best way to pick winners. - Wait a second, you have a system? - Hm, do I have a system? I haven't lost at the track in years. - Really? What's your secret? (phone ringing) - Oh, excuse me, phone. Gotta get it, so. - Y'all need to move back there now. - Okay, you heard the man. Move to the back of the barn. (people chattering) - [Student] There's something seriously wrong. - [Student] Did you see the size... - Mr. Johnson, What exactly is going on here? - Watch and learn, my boy, watch and learn. (horse neighing) (tense music) - Who's the chick? - She's a veterinarian. - Nice. (tense music) (gate slamming) - Pat, Pat, what exactly is going on here? - Watch and learn, my boy. (tense music) - And the rest, as they say, is up to nature. (man chuckling) (horses whinnying) (horse grunting) - Oh, gnarly. (horses whinnying) - Are you okay? - That was more than I needed to see. - You think you're sick to your stomach? How do you think that makes a guy feel? - Now is not a good time to try and make me laugh. (glorious music) - Okay. (clearing throat) We're running late, let's get back on the bus. Let's go, pronto. - Man, talk about Philly Fanatic. (students chattering) (Pat whistles) - Ah, I just made a complete idiot of myself. - I don't think anyone noticed. - Thanks. - No problem. Just don't let it happen again. - Y'all come back now, you here? - [Student] I don't feel so good. (student coughing) - Sure Robert, dinner sounds great. Okay, I will um, see at 7:30 then. Okay, Robert, okay. I gotta go now. - Hillary. Hey Chris. Katie and Ellen. Did you get her number? - She's got a boyfriend. - Did you get her number? - If you don't stop talking, I'm gonna have to break our date. - [Robert] Bye. (disconnected tone buzzing) - Southern gentleman. (light dramatic music) (rap music bumping) (sirens blaring) - So we're three months behind in the house in Saint Bart's and I'm going outta my mind. So I fly down there, get ahold of the contractor, pull him aside, and I said "Cliftone, word of advice." "Don't ever do business with a man named Cliftone." I said "Cliftone, are you a religious man?" He says, "Yes, mon." I said, "Would you ever lie to your priest, Cliftone?" He said, "No, mon." So I said, "Good," "let's just pretend I'm your God damn priest" "and tell me when the hell this job's gonna be finished." (couple laughing) - Sounds like you've led a pretty interesting life so far. - Yeah well. So what about you? What is it that you do? - Oh, I- - Hey! Get me another Makers when you get a chance, double. You want some more wine? - Sure. - And another glass of wine. Oh wait, wait, wait. Fuck it, let's get a whole bottle. - Wow. - Bring us a bottle to the Lafite, the '78. - Mr. Landler, are you sure? I mean, that's a 500- - Sure, I'm sure, honey. Don't you think this lovely lady deserves a chance to taste the best bottle of red wine in the house. (Maggie laughs) - Right away, sir. - You are really gonna enjoy this. I mean, the French, they know a thing or two about the wine, eh. - Oh yeah? - Ah, oui. (Maggie laughs) Ah, Maggie. (speaking in French) - What did you just say? - I said you are really, really beautiful. - Oh. (sighs) Thank you. (Maggie chuckles) - Oh yeah, ride the glory train! Oh God almighty, ride the train! Oh, I'm cumming, oh! (Robert panting) Oh, God damn, I needed that. (Robert panting) Was it good for you? - Oh, yeah. Epic. - You know, you never did tell me what it is you do for a living. - I'm the staff vet out at Hermitage Farm. - Ah. Horses. - Yes. - I used to own a few thoroughbreds myself. - Really? - Yeah, we had a real good run there for a while. There's Kelly's Delight, Kelly's fantasy, What the Kell, Kellamanjaro, Kellifornia. Then there was Kelter Skelter, Kellecatessin, Kellbassa. - Is there a theme here or is it just me? - Yeah. My first wife, her name was Kelly. - You don't say. - Oh, I'm sorry. I promised myself I wouldn't talk about her anymore. - Oh, no, I asked you about your horses, don't worry about- - It's just that she was so beautiful. She was a model. - Yeah. Yeah, I believe you mentioned that. - She even did some of those magazine covers, swimsuit issues all over the world. She was really something else. - Hmm. - Oh, that's all in the past. I'm not really into looks anymore. - What? - Oh, I don't mean to say you're not attractive, Maggie. You're very attractive. Well, I just slept with you, didn't I? - You bastard. - What? Kelly? Maggie. Oh, you're beautiful. (speaking in French) - You are a freak. - Oh, Christ, give me a break here. Don't do what Kelly did to me. That woman gave me a vasectomy of the heart. - Good. - Wait, Maggie! (speaking in French) - So you gonna call him? - No, absolutely not. Ugh, what is this stuff, anyway? - Country ham. It's a Kentucky tradition. - I think I need something a little less traditional, like a cheeseburger. - Maybe you should call him, just to make sure he doesn't, oh, kiss and tell. - He probably doesn't even remember it. And frankly, I don't care what he says or who he tells. I mean, could you explain something to me? - Sure. - Why is it that when a man sleeps with a woman on a first date, his buddies worship him as a stud? But oh God, I mean, if a woman sleeps with a man on a first date, well then she's labeled as a slut. - [Kate] A tramp. - A whore? - No habla ingles. - Mm-hm, typical. It's amazing that the human race has survived this long and only one legitimate gender. - You're really upset about this. - Yeah. But, it wasn't that I slept with him. Just that I kept thinking of someone else. - Oh, I know how you feel, honey. We've all done that, believe me. - No, I don't think you understand. It's not like I was imagining him to be someone else. It's that I couldn't get this guy outta my head. Like I was cheating on him or I let him down. - Well, you must not be over Matt yet. - It wasn't him I saw. - Who was it? - Some guy I just met yesterday. A school teacher. - Ha, you can forget about him. - Why? - Do you know how much, or should I say how little money they make? - I forgot, you're Republican. - I'm just practical. You should pursue Robert. He obviously really likes you. - I don't think so. Besides I'm never gonna hear from him again. - Why would you say that? - Because I slept with him. - And that means that he won't call? - When you sleep with a guy on a first date, you're telling him you're not interested in a relationship. - Hmm. Sure is a nice way to say it. (answering machine beeping) - Hi Maggie, it's Robert. I had a really great time last night. I hope we can get together again soon. Call me, 555-0118. (Robert sipping) (answering machine beeping) - I can't believe you rented a dog. - At least I'm honest. - What? - Canine ownership has nothing to do with mankind's love of animals. A guy gets a dog for one simple reason, to meet chicks. - So all that talk about man's best friend, unconditional love, a four-legged security system. - Mere rhetoric. Hey, be careful. That little fucker bit me on the way over here. Man, that just pisses me off. - Bad horoscope? - Eh, no, not that, Jennifer. - I thought she was history. - She was, till we went out again last night. - Oh I see, but today you're out trolling for women with a dog, so I'm assuming it didn't work out. - Actually it went great. At least it started off that way. Then we get back to her place. She invites me and then excuses herself to freshen up and we both know what that means. She needs to go to the bathroom before you fool around. - Right. - Oh, she's so cute. What's her name? - Uh, uh it's, uh, Shakespeare? - Shakespeare? But she's a girl. - Well, uh, it's a well known fact that he was in touch with his feminine side. Too young. - Not forever. So while she's in there taking a dump, I happened to poke around a little. - Oh no. - You will not fucking believe what I find in her linen closet. - Towels, pillowcase, blankets. What were you doing? - Sheets. Four God damn sets worth. - You have lost me again. - Don't you get it, man. Anybody that has more than two sets of sheets is changing them way too often. She's a total slut. - So you left? - Damn right I left. Right after I fucked her. - Wait a second. First you didn't want anything to do with this girl because she didn't put out. Now you don't wanna have anything to do with her because she does? - Yeah, that's pretty much it. Shit, I'm not gonna get serious with somebody that has sex with me on the second date. Though I'd probably nail her again if I had the chance. - Hi there. - Hi. She's so adorable. - Yes, but deceptively vicious. - Huh? - She bit four people already today. Has she even had her shots yet? (dog barks) - You are unstoppable. - You know, I've been thinking. - Oh really? - Yeah. That chick from the horse farm. - Who, Maggie? - Yeah. How'd you find out she had a boyfriend. - Well, what's it matter? - It's not exactly your style to come right out and ask. - Well, I didn't. I overheard her talking on the phone with some guy. They were making a date, she was laughing. - And so you think that date is her boyfriend? - Call it men's intuition. - Call it dog shit. - [Carter] Well then who was that on the phone? - I don't know, probably some teaser horse, dude. I bet she made the whole thing up to make you jealous. - Ah, I suppose it couldn't hurt to call her. - Who knows, with the proper technique you might just end up with a date. Meet you at your place in half an hour. - What, you're giving up on the dog already? - It's not working out quite the way I'd hoped. (phone ringing) - [Answering Machine] Hi, this is Maggie. Leave a message and I'll call you back as soon as possible. Thanks. (answering machine beeping) - Hey, it's me again. You know, Robert. I'm in the Beamer right now. My car phone is 555-0118. Home, as you know, is 555-0149. The boat, well actually the yacht, is 555-0198. The fax number is- - You know, I've called women for dates before. I think I can handle this. - Sure you can. You wanna end up with another chick friend? You wouldn't even be making this call if I hadn't put you up to it, so we're gonna do it my way. The worst case scenario is your first career casual enemy. - Fine, fine. Let's hear it. - Okay. One, don't stay on the phone any longer than you have to. It's like a covert military operation. You go in, you kick some ass and you get the hell out. - Yes, sir. - Two, avoid the words sorry, maybe, and we. We, what's wrong with we? - She could infer it to mean that you consider the two of you a couple before she considers the two of you a couple. That's dangerous ground, thin ice. Keep out, road closed. - I get the picture. - Uh, three, don't let the whole thing last any longer than 30 seconds. - 30 seconds? - Hi, how are you? Single, let's have dinner, super, goodnight. Don't worry, I'll time ya. All right. (determined music) I've got tone. You may fire when ready. (phone dialing) - Where do you get this stuff anyway? - You don't wanna know. (phone ringing) - Look asshole, what happened between us was just one night and that's all it will ever be. Got it? There are a million numbers in the phone book. Find another! (phone beeping) (men laughing) - Jesus. - Not exactly the charm school valedictorian now, is she? - I must have called the wrong number. - Ah, I'm sorry. I must have skipped the section of the lecture that covered basic dialing. - Ha ha ha. - Ha ha. Let's try it again now, Romeo. (phone dialing) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Is this Maggie? - Uh, yeah. - This is uh, Carter Wagner. Met you on the field trip yesterday. - Oh, hi. I wondered what happened to you. - I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to say goodbye. - Oh, that's okay. - A few of the kids were uh, a little, uh, how should I put it, uh, awe struck by the chain of events that transpired. - Yeah, I was a little surprised they let your group watch a breeding. - That makes two of us. Uh, anyway, uh, I was wondering. - Yeah? - If you were free next weekend, maybe we could get together. That is, if you don't have a boyfriend. - No. - No? - No, I don't have a boyfriend and I'd love to get together. Um, how about lunch? (Pat sneezing) Goodness. God bless you, are you okay? - Uh, yeah, yeah, allergies. Could you hold on a second? - [Maggie] Sure. - No lunch. Lunch bad, dinner yes, dinner good. - In English please. - Lunch is too safe. It's got a time limit. She can always cut it short by saying she's gotta get back to the ranch and watch more horses do the bone dance. Dinner good, lunch bed. - Maggie, hi. Um, how about dinner instead of lunch? Heck, I can't take a date seriously unless it starts after sundown. - Fair enough. - Great, well what kind of food do you- (Pat sneezes) (Maggie laughs) Did you happen to see what the pollen count was today? I'll just be one more sec. - Take your time. - What the hell are you doing? - What the hell are you doing? - Seeing where she wants to eat? - Why? - I don't know, Pat, out of courtesy. - Oh, pick the restaurant later. That way she can't say she'll meet you there. - And that would be bad? - Hell, hell yes. Separate cars mean separate destinations when the dinner is over. That means no awkward moment on her doorstep at midnight. Besides, it's bad for the environment, all those cars. - Maggie, hi. - Hi. - How does eight- (phone beeping) - Oh, shoot, I'm sorry. Can you hold on one second? - I think I owe you that. - Hello? - It's call waiting. - Eh, it's probably her mother. - How do you know? - It's always their mother. Hey, you're doing well. Now just set the time and get out. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi, you know what? I'm sorry, but I need to take it. It's my mom. - Does Saturday work for you? - Sure. I'll pick you up at eight. - Sounds good. - Great. - And don't forget, I wanna hear all about your wagering system. - We'll see, bye. - Goodbye. - You and your systems. - Hey. She says she never loses at the track, and I need a sure thing for the big bet. - The big bet. Do you ever consider that her wagering system may be not wagering at all? (peaceful music) - Oh. Thanks. - You're welcome. Everything all right? - Yeah, why? - You just seem quiet. I wanna make sure you were okay, what, with little Rufus leaving and all. - Oh, he left? What happened? - He's gone down to Louisiana to compete in the National Frog Gigging Championships. He was sorry he didn't get the chance to see ya off, but he said he'd bring you back some genuine Louisiana frog legs. - (laughs) Seems like a very sweet kid. - He is. Thank you. He's gonna be a vet hisself someday. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well I gotta get back to the foes in barn two. - Okay. - Oh, almost forgot. A fella called for you this morning. Said his name was Robert. He left his number. - Thanks. (bell ringing) - So, do you wanna go out to a movie or something sometime? - What, you ask me in front of all your friends? - Shit, that didn't work at all. (people chattering) - [Boy] It's not like he's insanely hot or anything. - What was that all about? - Nothing. - Oh, here we go again. - No, I'm not kidding. I asked Megan out and she said no. By my account, I got nothing. - Oh, that's unfortunate. - Yeah, yeah. That's a good way of putting it. - I wish I could say it gets easier as you get older. - Yeah great, thanks. Any ideas on what to do next? - Well for the next couple of days, don't do anything. - Yeah, thanks, then what? - Ask her out again? - Shit. - Geez, what happened to these guys. - Oh yeah, my old stereo kept eating them so I got a new one. - You didn't wanna fix the old one? - Mm, too much trouble. But now Chris is saying that it needs two cables and I have to buy some adapter thingy. (lively music) You rock. So uh, where are you taking your big date? - Ooh, uh. (phone ringing) - Oh! Oh, fuck. - [Carter] What? - It's Chris. - So? - So, ooh. Here, catch. - What, what is this? - Uh, that would be my cell phone. Call me here, now. - What? - Just do it. Hello? Hi. Not much. (phone dialing) Hey listen, my mom's not due back till tomorrow, so I thought maybe you might want, oh, hold on, that's me other line. Can you hold on a sec? Okay. (phone beeping) - It's me. - Hi, how are ya? - Uh, confused. Why are we doing this? - Oh, well I don't feel like talking to Chris right now. - Why did you answer the phone? - See, this way I can find out where I stand. I leave him on hold for a few minutes, and if he's still there when I click back over, then I know that he's still whipped. - And to think all this time I was foolish enough to believe there actually was another call. - Not usually. - What if he hangs up? - Then I wait for him to call me back. - How do you know he'll do that? - Because he's a guy. Okay, that should do it. You could. (phone beeping) Chris? Oh my God, I am so sorry. That's my mom. I need to take it. Can I call you back? Oh great, I, huh? Oh, yeah, of course we're still on for this weekend. Okay, bye. (Erin sighs) - You said that was your mother and it wasn't. - Yeah. Oh yeah, I haven't talked to my mom in like a week. - Huh? Do you think I can expect the same level of bullshit from Maggie? - Only if you guys get serious. Don't even think about it. - What? - Don't you dare take her flowers on your first date. You have to save it for more appropriate occasions. Like after the first time you guys have sex. Or when you wanna forgive her for cheating on you. (tires screeching) (people chattering) - [Woman] Vow, you know it is. Chapter four is planting the seed. (women giggling) - Don't you guys think she just looks beautiful today? - Oh my gosh. - You do. - Oh, she does. - All the glow. - You know, I love the title of your book, "Growing Your Garden And Managing Your Man. - That's great. - That's great. - [Woman] I'll tell you what. - Oh, how amazing Janet? Your first house, your first baby, your first book, all in the same year. - Oh, I'll tell what, I could not have done it without my Irwin. - [Women] Aww. - He is just the best husband I ever could have hoped for. I mean, he is always unwavering in his support. - [Woman] How sweet. - He is always unconditional in his love, and he is always out of town on business. (women squealing) - You are so bad! (women chattering) - Here's to all you. - Oh, group hug. - Oh! (doorbell ringing) - I'll get it. (women clearing their throats) - [Woman] So Kate, uh, what's with your friend? - Yeah, she seems so distant. - [Woman] So removed. - [Woman] So depressed. - She must be from New York. - Oh, just lay off her, all right? I just wanted her to meet some people. I had to practically drag her here. - Roses for you, Jenna. - Oh! - Bring them over here. Oh my. Oh, could you set them there? Thank you, darlin'. - Oh, they must be from Irwin. How romantic. - He is such a sweetheart. I miss your smile. - Oh! - Love, Robert Landler? (women gasping) - Robert Landler? Oh my. - Oh. - While the wolfs away, the lamb will play. - [Woman] Uh-huh. - [Janet] Well now wait, wait a minute here. This card isn't addressed to me. - [Woman] What? - Well these flowers aren't for me. They're for you, Maggie. - Oh! - What? - [Woman] Somebody made themselves a fast friend. - That Bobby Landler is quiet the lady killer. - You should know Carrie Kay. - How did he even know? Kate. Kate, could I please you in the kitchen alone for just a second? - Okay. (women clearing their throats) - They sure are nice roses. (women giggling) - [Woman] Yes, they are lovely. - Janet should get to keep them, don't you think? I mean, after all, they did come to her house. - Yes, yes. - Definitely. - You're right. I mean, I don't know. - Most definitely. - Yes. - I think. - You should have called him sooner. I mean, after all he is a very eligible bachelor. - I don't care if he's the most eligible guy on the planet. He's not this woman's Mr. Right? (Kate giggles) - Mr. Right? You're still holding out for him? What if Robert turns out to be Mr. Close? - Mr. Close? This guy isn't even Mr. Remote Possibility. I appreciate what you're trying to do for me. I really do. I'm having dinner with someone tonight, and I'm really looking forward to it. I just think I'd enjoy it a lot more if I didn't have to worry about being stalked by Dionysus himself. - Well, I'll help you set Robert straight. I'll give him a call and I'll just tell him to quit bothering you. - It's gonna take a lot more than that to stop Robert Landler. (gun cocking) He should know by now not to ever, ever mess with Southern women. - Oh my God. - Slob Landler sent me those same roses in 1993. - I got 'em in '91. - '87, and again, in '94. - You set me up with this guy? - Oops. - So let's go kick his ass. - [Women] Let's kick his ass! - Settle down, settle down, girls. Thanks, but no. I must face him, alone. - [Woman] Ah, shit. - [Robert] I'll be down in just a second, sugar. - Oh, what a colossal jackass. - Well, this is a nice surprise. Well, sit down. Take a load off, stay a while. - Thanks. - God, I don't know what I'm thinking trying to tie my tie with a drink in my hand. - Well, something tells me if anyone can do it, you can. - I'll be done with this wedding about 10:30. Why don't you let me buy a dinner afterwards? - I'll have to take a rain check. - How about tomorrow? We can go down to the river, have a little sail- - Shut up a second, Robert. - Sure. Anything you want, precious. - It's become clear to me, don't ask me how, that you like me, oh, just a little more than I like you. - Oh, what do you want? No relationship ever attains a perfect equilibrium of affection. You ought to know that. We did sleep together, didn't we? That oughta count for something. - Yes, we did. And I think it was a mistake. No scratch that, I know it was a mistake. - Maggie, I admit I'm not perfect. But if there's one thing my life experience has taught me, it's you have to be willing to make certain sacrifices to make relationships work. So if there's anything I can do, anything I can change in my life to make you feel more comfortable around me, to feel more compatible with me, I don't care what it is. You just say the word and I'll do it. - Well, now that you mention it, I did have something in mind. - What is it? - I think- - My clothes. - No, actually it's not your clothes. - My car? That's what it is. I admit, it's not too PC to be driving a $80,000 BMW. Tell you what I'll do. First thing tomorrow morning, I'll traded in for a Taurus, a used one. - It's not your car. - Well, what is it then, my hair? It's real, I swear to God. Give it a tug. - Drinking, Robert. You drink too much. I haven't seen you yet without a drink in your hand. Quit drinking and we just might have a future. - I see. Sorry. Well, look at that. Bobby Landler without a drink in his hand. You know you're right, Maggie. - I am? - Yeah, I do need to make some changes in my life. - Are you sure? - Oh, most definitely. And I'm gonna start by doing a little redecorating. - Huh? - Leave. (Maggie sighs) (speaking in France) (bottle popping) (pleasant music) (people chattering) - Oh, it is so wonderful to see you. - How are you, my boy? - Good, good. Can't complain. - Oh! Thank God, you're still single. - Don't mind Eddie. (laughs) Have you seen Bridget yet? - No, no, not yet. But she told me she was gonna be here. - She's dying to see you. I'll just go get her. - Uh, bring her back alone. So, how's work treating ya, son? - Great, great. The kids are wonderful. And the school's brought in some solid new teachers. - Oh, that's good, solid is good. You're a solid fellow. (Pat burps) - Another. An open bar's worst enemy. Come on, set me up. - Carter? Oh my God. - Bridgette. - How are you? - Wow. Gosh, I haven't seen you since... You look great. - So do you. Anything to drink? - Uh, nothing for me, but bring her a Southern Comfort on the rocks. - This is a pretty fancy soiree, huh? - Oh, I'll say. I think just being here doubles my net worth. So are you bound for the altar anytime soon, or? - God damn it! (boyfriend moaning) - Oh shit. - I love you, baby. Who's this um, dude? - Oh, I'm sorry. Trey, this is, Carter. Carter, this is Trey, my boyfriend. - How's it hanging, dude? - Long and strong, my man. - Um, cool, yeah. - Trey plays guitar. - Yeah, yeah, I gathered. - Hey, I'm gonna go nap some carbs, okay? - Okay. He's so cute. - Does he speak English? - He's just really hungry and tired. You know, rehearsing and all. - So, how are you two getting along? Are you catching up on old times? - Yo, B! - Oh, I gotta go. You, it was great to see you. Maybe we can grab lunch. - Yeah. - God damn it! (glass shattering) - Do you get it? - Not in the slightest. - Eddie and I are at a total loss. We love you. We think you are perfect for her. You know you've always been our favorite. - That's very kind of you to say. - No, no, no, it's true. Well, maybe someday. Hm, so what are you doing later, huh? - (growling) Damn it! (glass shattering) - Okay. - Well I better go stop him before someone gets hurt. - Yeah. - Dude, who's the milf? - Milf? - Mother I'd like to fuck- - I got it. Charming. - Hey, what do you want from me with an open bar, refined behavior? Not gonna happen. Whoa, ho. Hey, hey, ooh. So, who is she? - Bridget's mom. Plans for me to be her son-in-law didn't quite pan out. - Dude, what are you wasting your time buttering up the parents when you ought to be working on the daughters. - I am working on the daughters. Their parents liking me is just a bonus. - Hell, what you mean, it's just beat. Do you think for one second that Bridget's parents are big fans of that string picking butt face over there? ♪ Kumbaya lord, kumbaya ♪ You know, I'm about one beer away from going Bluto on that guy. What are you, sober? - My date's tonight, remember? - Oh, holy shit. You know, I've been meaning to tell you. I've been thinking, no, about where you should take her. - We're going to the Bristol. - Take her to Genny's. - Genny's? - Take her to Genny's because it shouldn't matter where you take a girl on a first date. It shouldn't matter if you bring her flowers or if you own a dog or if there's candlelight or if there's live music or if there's a dessert tray or a, a somoly, smolier. - A wine steward. - That's what I said. Anyway, none of that stuff should affect how much a chick digs you. - Oh, I should get going. - No uh, be late. Chicks dig it. - I think you're sobering up. - Genny's, take her to Genny's best cheeseburgers in Eastern time zone. - Yeah, but on a first date. - Hey, correct me if I'm wrong, but on your ideal first date you'd rather fall in love than get laid, right? Trust me. You do not wanna fall in love with somebody who doesn't appreciate a good cheeseburger. Genny's!

You Southern boys really know how to flatter a girl. - Well just, just, no, hold on a second. Let, hear me out on this, okay? I'm 31 years old. I've gone out on dozens of first dates and I've always followed the same nice routine. I wash my car. I show up on time with flowers, spring for a candlelight dinner. I drink responsibly and then boom, I'm walking her to her doorstep and before I can kiss her goodnight, she's telling me what a wonderful time she had, that I'm a great guy, but we can't be anything more than just friends. And we both know what that means. - Not interested. - Exactly. - So here I am a few hours back and I start up the same routine. And then I get to thinking, at this point in my life I have plenty of friends. I, I don't need anymore. So, at considerable risk, I'm not taking you out on my standard, nice, sweet, kind, romance 101 first date because I have no desire, Maggie, zero, none, to be just friends with you. - So what do you want, Carter? You figure if you insult me by being late, threaten my gastrointestinal integrity by taking me out for bar food and brainwash me with country music, that you might get lucky tonight. - What, what? - Maybe there's somebody out there who would have appreciated flowers on a first date 'cause she hasn't gotten flowers like that since high school. Maybe she would've loved the fact that you picked her up on time and in a clean car. That you went to the trouble to find a nice restaurant and that you didn't get fallen down drunk. So you not only get her home safely, but remember the good night kiss she's been dreaming of giving you since the first time she laid eyes on you. - Are, are you trying to say that that person is you? - How will you ever know now, since you've reduced this first date to some sort of game? - Whoa, whoa, I think you've got the wrong idea here. I, I can assure you, I do not play games. - I should have known better than a fall for your nice guy rap. - Rap? This is not a rap, okay? A rap implies a scheme that's successful on a regular basis and believe me, it's not- - Excuse me. Y'all mind if I join you? - Do I know you? - I don't think we've been formally introduced, but I did happen to overhear some of your discussion, and I thought maybe I might provide some assistance. - This is a really nice touch, Carter. I'm almost impressed. - Wait, I did not set this up. - Kids, kids, relax. I'm here to represent your best interests. I am here to protect you. Now if we get started, this shouldn't take too awful long. - What shouldn't take too awful long? - Drawing up your pre-relationship agreement. - Pre what? - Pre-relationship agreement. Y'all heard of pre-nuptial agreements? Well, same concept, only a bit more cautious. - Wow, that is just super. Carter honey, why don't you just take me home? You know what? Don't sweat dinner, 'cause I still have time to order a pizza. Thank you so much, sir, for everything. - Young lady, before you condemn the merits of this agreement, might I point out to you that you have reached a level of cynicism so severe that rather embrace this young man's honesty, you casually dismiss it as some sort of ploy to seduce you. As for you son, what could possibly have crawled up inside your head and possessed you to abandon the philosophy by which you have lived your entire life? Maybe it'll turn out that the two of you are really not right for each other, but wouldn't you rather arrive at that determination based on who you really are? Now, before God takes me from this planet, let's get on with it. Paragraph one. "At the commencement of said relationship," "each party agrees to fully disclose any current marriages," "dependent children, bizarre religious beliefs," "phobias, fears, social diseases," "strange political affiliations," "or currently active relationships with anyone else" "that have not yet been terminated." "Failure to make these disclosures" "will result in immediate termination of said relationship" "before it has a chance to, quote, get anywhere, unquote" - I'll be damned. That actually looks pretty good. - I'll take it this is your first experience with the sweet daddy? You're in for treat. ♪ She kicked my dog ♪ ♪ And slammed the door ♪ ♪ Stole my heart and my brand new Ford ♪ - Paragraph nine. "For the first 60 days," "Both parties agree never to use the phrase, I love you." "Now y'all may love plants, dogs, cats, cars, concerts," "or the way of particular pair of jeans fits," "but not each other." Am I making myself clear, young lady? - I'm listening, I was just resting my eyes. - Maggie, why don't you let me take you home? - Uh, uh-uh-uh-uh, in a minute. I would like to hear the paragraph on grounds for termination. - [Lawyer] Why that would be paragraph 10. ♪ But I was drunk the day my mom got outta prison ♪ ♪ And I went to pick her up in the rain ♪ ♪ But before I could get to the station in the pickup truck ♪ - Look Maggie, well. - You wanna know how I win at the track, Carter? I don't look at speed figures or recent workouts or previous performances. I don't pay attention to anything that's happened in the past. - Well, what do you look at? - The horses. I look at their eyes. How confidently they walk. How comfortable they are with our jockey. - How do you know which one's to, to bet on? - I just go with the one that feels right. Don't bother walking me to the door now, Carter. You wouldn't wanna wind up with another friend, now would you? (melancholy music) - Did I ever show you my tongue trick? - I love you, but I'm not in love with you. - Just listen to some of these satisfied clients. - [Carter] Oh God. - You know, when a guy says, "Trust me," I'm sorry, but that's just not good enough anymore. You know, I'm gonna need a polygraph test. I'm gonna need a handwriting sample. I might even need a urinalysis. (pounding on door) - It's freaking midnight. What's going on? Whoa, Erin, what is, what is wrong? - Chris dumped me. - You fucking believe this bullshit? - I'm stunned. - What? - Well you treated him like shit. What do you expect? - Oh, well I appreciate your sympathy. Sorry to bother you. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, come here. Sorry, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. - He didn't even have the decency to do it in person. The fucking prick did it over the phone. - You wanna talk about it? - No. - You wanna sit down? - No. - Do you, do you wanna? - No. - We were supposed to go out, only at the last minute, someone else called me to see if I wanted to go to the Alanis Morissette set concert, you know? So I, so I called Chris and I told, I, I mean, I, I asked him if it was okay if we just went out to dinner tomorrow night so I could go to the concert tonight, and he says that that won't really work for him because he's breaking up with me as of tomorrow night. - Ouch. - Yeah, so I told him to go to hell and I called the other guy. - Oh, the Alanis Morissette guy. - Yeah, I called him back and he said that he already gave the ticket to someone else. So not only did I get dumped, but I didn't even get to go to the concert. I'm such a dumb fucking loser. - Oh, come on. Come here, shh. Hey, it's okay, it's okay. Don't worry about it. Look, you're better off without him. I mean heck, the guy couldn't even hook up your stereo. - I want you. I've always wanted you. - Um. - Make love to me. - No. - Please? - No. - Pretty please? - No. - I'm not wearing any underwear. (sensual music) (water squelching) (water splashing) - No, no, no, no, no. We can't do this. - Why? - You're upset, and I would be taking advantage of you, okay? Because we're friends, and sleeping with you would change that. It would change everything. - Shit. Carter, it's just sex. You have the whole rest of your life to be monogamous. - That's just it, Erin. I'm ready for the whole rest of my life to begin. I want to be in love with the next person I sleep with. I want the next person I sleep with to be the last person I sleep with. - No guy hopes for that. - This one does. - This is not happening.

Well what's he done to you? - It's not what he did to me. It's what I did to him. I've spent my whole life waiting for this guy, this perfect person, and it dawned on me that I've set my standard so high, it'd be impossible for anyone. Even the supposed man of my dreams, could never live up to my expectations. - You have any idea how many folks there are in this world? (Maggie laughs) - Billions? - Well, when you start courting, especially in this town, there probably aren't so many. In fact, I'll bet there are only six or so. - (laughs) Six? - Maybe seven, but they all know each other, so word gets around fast. Now, if you try to act in a somewhat decent manner towards other folks, even if that person sitting across from you ain't right for you, maybe they'll know somebody who is. And if I was you, I'd give this Carter fella a call, but quick. - Why would I wanna go and do that? - Well, it's obvious he's gotten under your skin pretty good. - No he hasn't. - Now Maggie. - Really. - Maggie, Maggie, Maggie. Don't you know you can't shit a shitter? - I'm not trying to shit you. - Well, let's see. One, it's a gorgeous Sunday afternoon and you've come to work even though there ain't a sick horse on the farm. Two, the radio in your office is playing country music. Three, your shirt's on backwards. Four- - Okay, you made your point. - [Rufus] Good, I didn't have a four. (trumpets blaring) - [Announcer] The horses are moving toward the starting gate for the eighth race here at Churchill Downs. The eighth race, named The Winston Rule. - Hey man, sorry I'm late. - Don't sweat it. - Who'd you bet this race? - Number five. - The horses have reached the starting gate. It's now post time. - Shit, too late for me to bet. Five? Fiasco? Christ, she sucks. She doesn't wanna race it over a year. She's 50-1. - Yeah, well something about her just feels right. - What? Oh no. Oh, sheep cock. Not last night? - Bad. - Worst ever? - No, she didn't throw up. - [Announcer] They're at the post. And they're off! For the lead from the inside- - Where'd you take her? - You don't remember? - Why should I? I didn't go with you. Did I? - [Announcer] Don't Dog Me is eighth, followed by What The Fuck, then Key Speed late, and the trailer, Fiasco. - She at least like your sweet daddy? - Not enough to wanna see me again. - [Pat] Even as a friend? - Even as a friend. - Hey, that's progress. - It doesn't feel like progress, Pat. It feels like a mistake. I feel like I gave up on being myself on the one night I didn't need to. - I don't care if you took her out on the best day of her life or the worst, if she didn't see what a catch you are, then she's the one that made the mistake. - Thanks. - [Announcer] For the stretch. It's still Went So Well. Maybe, round now up on the outside, here comes Fiasco! - Dude, check it out. Holy shit, your horse. - [Announcer] She's a one shot- - God, come on! Fiasco! - Come on, baby! Make a move! - Yeah! Go, go! - [Announcer] Outside, Fiasco! - Go, come on! - Go, go! - Go, go! - Run! - [Announcer] Went So Well! Went So Well wins it by a nose! - Shit! Monkey piss! God damn! - Son of a- - God! Oh man, so close. Wait, hey, you must have bet her to place, right? So you still won something. - Not exactly. - [Announcer] The unofficial winner of the eighth race is number two, Went So Well. Went So Well is owned by Woody Johnson, trained by Benny Woosley, and the rider- - Oh my God. You did it. You made the big bet. That would've been 25 grand. Jesus, that would've been awesome. What now? - Credit cards. - Credit cards. - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, please hold all mutual tickets. There is a steward's inquiry into the sprint run of the eighth race. - Awesome. - No way, they never take down a winner. - They are today, baby. This has already been the greatest morning in history. - Something tells me it involves a woman. - Yeah well, I get home from the wedding last night. I was pretty snockered. - Oh, really? - Yeah. So I pass out. Next thing I know somebody's banging on my door. You will never, ever, in a jillion years guess who it was. - Oh no. - Erin. - She was really upset. That joker she'd been dating broke up with her. She just fell into my arms and I just held her. I could tell she hadn't been held like that in long time. You know? Next thing I know we're kissing then, like I said, this morning was the greatest morning in history. I'll tell you, man, she is a wonderful woman. Smart, she's ah, beautiful, caring. I think I'm in love with her. - Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please for interference in the stretch. Number two Went So Sell has been disqualified, and number five, Fiasco, has been moved to the top spot. Fiasco, a 50-1 shot- (lively music) $102. (men screaming) Now moving into the winners circle, number five, Fiasco. - [Men] Yeah! (men screaming) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Maggie? - Carter? - Hi. - Hi. - Look, uh, I just wanted to say, uh, I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - You're sorry? - You're sorry? - Why should you be sorry? - Why should you be sorry? - Wait a second. - Wait, wait a second. - There, go. - No, ladies first. - Okay. Look, I, I have to be honest with you. I was a little nervous last night. You see, I hate dating. - No, no, I hate dating. - I hate dating more than you do. - Nobody could hate dating more than I do. - I'd rather have a root canal than go out on a date. - I'd rather have this argument in person. If you wanna find out why last night may have been the best bad date in history, meet me at Filmworks at 8:30. - Filmworks, wait. - And don't forget to bring your copy of our agreement. (calming music) - You know, where I come from, we actually watch movies from inside the theater. - Well, I uh never had any intention of taking you to the movies, but I figured it'd be a good backup plan for me in case you didn't show up. - No such luck. - So what's this about our agreement? - Read the last line. - "Addendum." "No matter what," "both parties agree to give it one more shot." - So what do you think? - Well I signed it. I'm legally bound. (Carter chuckles) So, why was last night the best bad date all the time? - Mm, well, (laughs) let's just say it had something to do with a horse named Fiasco. - You won? - I won big. - Oh, fantastic. Fiasco. - I mean, if the date had been anything other than a Fiasco, who knows who I would've bet on? So I figured the least I could do was take you to dinner. - Sure, as long as we agree to one more thing. We can never be just friends. - Yeah, that's a good idea. (couple chuckling) You know, someday this dating thing is gonna be over. - Oh, you reckon? - Oh yes ma'am. Someday this dating thing is gonna be over. - These are for you. - Thank you. No one's ever given me flowers before. - [Maggie] Regarding last night Carter, there was something I neglected to mention. - [Carter] What? - [Maggie] That was the best cheeseburger I've ever had. ♪ In an imperfect world like this ♪ ♪ I'm looking for a perfect fit ♪ ♪ A perfect fit that don't exist ♪ ♪ Except in my head I guess, I ♪ ♪ I feel like giving up ♪ ♪ And that's what I'm afraid of ♪ ♪ Na na na na na na ♪ ♪ It's another Friday night again ♪ ♪ Sha la la la la la ♪ ♪ Loneliest shape I'm in ♪ ♪ Round and round and round we go ♪ ♪ Where there's doubts I think I know ♪ ♪ You get used to being it though ♪ ♪ That's what I'm afraid of ♪ ♪ The way I live my life's a joke ♪ ♪ I put everything under a microscope ♪ ♪ The how the when the where the why ♪ ♪ God I over analyze ♪ ♪ I think my way right out of love ♪ ♪ And that's what I'm afraid of ♪ ♪ Na na na na na na na ♪ ♪ It's another Friday night again ♪ ♪ Sha la la la la la la ♪ ♪ Loneliest shape I'm in ♪ ♪ Round and round and round we go ♪ ♪ Where this stops I think I know ♪ ♪ You get used to being alone ♪ ♪ That's what I'm afraid of ♪ ♪ Yeah na na na na na na na ♪ ♪ It's another Friday night again ♪ ♪ Sha la la la la la la ♪ ♪ Loneliest shape I'm in ♪ ♪ Round and round and round we go ♪ ♪ Where this stops I think I know ♪ ♪ You get used to being alone ♪ ♪ And that's what I'm afraid of ♪ ♪ Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of ♪ ♪ Na na na na na na na ♪ ♪ It's another Friday night again ♪ ♪ Sha la la la la la ♪ (lively music) ♪ B-O-R-K ♪ ♪ All the way to the mack ♪ ♪ Gotta get back to the shack with the honey back ham ♪ ♪ The P-P-pork products ♪ ♪ B-B-B-Baked ham, ♪ ♪ P-P-P-Pork products ♪ ♪ Well it's chili def fresh mack daddy Lil Fresh ♪ ♪ My road hosed down with just jelly and jam on that ham ♪ ♪ P-P-Pork products ♪
