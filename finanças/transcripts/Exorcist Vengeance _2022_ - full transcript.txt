You may go to him my child. Which way did he go? Which way! Hey! Hey! You a priest? I thought you were a cop. What you want, confession? Jesus Christ! No, but he did send me. Please, please. Wait. - Do you repent? - Yes. Oh god, please, let me go. Not my choice. Put down the gun now! - Police! - Stop him! Need some back up. Magda! Magda! Magda! Magda! Mrs. Agnes? Mrs. Agnes? Let me help you. She warned the world but they won't listen. They choose to be blind to the test but just because something is hidden doesn't mean it doesn't exist! The door has been opened. You said your mother had dementia. - Since last year. - I'm sorry. She'd been declining. That's why my sister and her children recently returned from America. God, I didn't think- Why would my mother do this? Sometimes people in that condition, they often feel disoriented. They don't know where they are, who they are. It's hard, I know to think she was someone else before she died. However, it's worth knowing it wasn't her. You said there was a witness. Here, it should make you feel better. I know it must have been difficult telling the police what happened with Nanna. Magda! I'll be outside. Magda? Are you okay? Yes, Rebecca. I'm fine, thank you. How about you? And you shall not fear them, for it is the Lord that fights for you. Have you ever considered practicing what you preach, Father Jozsef? I don't remember giving a sermon, bishop. Were I a stranger realistically speaking would you have shot me? You're renting a room out back. Oh, well it seems that kind of behavior has already gotten you in enough trouble for one week, don't you think? The Church will inevitably tire of bailing you out, I guarantee it. Oh, but you have never been one for authority, have you, oh no, beyond that of our Lord, of course. Such a shame too, you could have had my position if Father Frezeli was such a problem to you. He wasn't a problem for me, Bishop. Then perhaps you could have handled it privately, away from this congregation. He was liked, Andres, confronted him was always going to make you an enemy. What he was doing should have made him an enemy. It's my duty to protect innocents. At least you're predictable, Andres, but that does not excuse you. We are not the judge nor the jury. We leave that to him and only him. I'm aware, trust me. These symbols were found at a property belonging to a popular donor to our cause. The Vatican has requested your services specifically. We want this handled quickly and quietly, if you can manage that. I believe you have seen this before. Similar. But you know what it means? There is a need for our most of unholy of ceremonies, Andres. One of your students. This calls for a professional, someone who won't let the devil's trickery confuse them. I have mass. I think you'll find I am more than capable of leading your sermons while you're away. I do not have a criminal record, of course but I am sure I can manage. You know, the Pope appreciates your service. I'm sure. So, what do you think? I remember when the world was easier but now. You showed me the path of the light, all I seem to find is darkness. Let's hope I'm wrong this time. His work is never done but when it is, I will see you again. No you can't. Enjoyed the city I see. Dad. Hopefully you got it out of your system. I'm sorry, Rose wanted to come back- - Don't bother explaining. It's been difficult enough as it is. Your mother needs to speak to you. He's just covering for me it's my fault. Oh, I know. You said it's been difficult. Rose. That must be him. Who? Father Jozsef. How long do you intend on staying? As long as it takes. I don't understand. Your grandmother was very unwell, Nicholas. Yeah, but she was playing cards when we left. And what about Magda, you said she became aggressive, right? Why is she locked upstairs? This is Christine my sister and her kids, Nick and Rebecca and my daughter, Rose. This is Father Jozsef. He's here to help with our problem, if of course, Magda isn't just sick. You have a lovely home. Thank you. Come on, what is this the fucking exorcist? God, it's absurd, you're out of your minds. You must forgive my son, he and Magda are quite close. Rebecca why don't you show Father Jozsef to his room. Of course. - Father. - Hmm? Thank you for coming. This means a lot to me. - Here's your room. - Hmm. Just let me know if you need anything. The maid, which room is she in? The drawing room. In the room with the symbols? Is that a problem? Not ideal but I have something for it. I tried to help her but she was different. Do you know what you saw? All I know is she does not have a head cold. Hmm. I will be ready to start soon. Tonight? I thought that Sunday was the day of rest. For him, yes, but that's true with our enemies. I need you to read this to her. Me? Well, surely this would be better coming from you. I must observe. So, this is what a provocation? An examination. You are to diagnose Magda's condition, correct? Or at least that's what my sister told me. Exorcists deal with demons, not the mentally ill. We try to avoid it, yes. Well, we'll see. When you start reading don't stop, understand? The last time I saw her, she tried to attack me. - Will she do that again? - Likely. Mrs. Ketchick, I'm Father Jozsef from the Catholic Church. I came here today on behalf our Lord God and our savior. We have determined you're possessed by devil. I'm fine. Oh, oh my head, my head. She's just sick, I did say. We will now begin a short prayer in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. May he deliver you from evil. Surely this isn't necessary. My Lord you are all powerful. We beg you for the deliverance of our brothers and sisters who are enslaved by the evil one. I told you. All the saints in heaven come to our aid, rid this innocent of the devil. From anxiety, sadness and obsessions, we beg you, free us. From hatred, fornication and envy, we beg you, free us. From thoughts of jealousy, rage and death, we beg you, free us. From every form of sin, we beg you, free us. That's it, Magda's quite clearly disturbed. Keep going. I don't see what manufacturing hysteria will achieve. call the soldiers, the best adored are sent to beat me, pathetic. It's been awhile, Andres. At least it has been since we were last face to face. Still the same Andres, the same man who drove his poor wife towards the darkness. Nick. You think your worthless God cansave you? He will punish you like he did me, just like you did to Emily. Oh, Father, oh. We need to move her now. I won't ask again. Hurry. She's heavier than she looks. She has a devil inside her now. Christy, leave us alone. - Please! - Come on, come on. This is amateur work, Father. You know these binds can't hold me. Your blasted God doesn't love you, beause you're incapable. Take it off! We are done here. We can't leave her alone, what if she chokes? She is not there. And let us not be weary in well doing, for in due season we shall reap if we faint not. You know as fun as it is to watch you take your frustrations out on a dart board, it's been a long day. You just need to relax. I'm fucking trying to relax. Come on, play another round with me? It stopped being fun about an hour ago. Plus, we got an exorcism tomorrow, don't wanna miss that. Christine really has outdone herself this time. Hey, fuck off. It's not her fault she's like this, turning to priests to do a, I don't know, whatever this is. Well, Magda is possessed. Hey be respectful, she raised us. Yeah well, that is until your family went off across the pond and left us all by our lonesome. My mother's decision, not mine. Jesus fine, I know when I'm not wanted. Sweet dreams, Nicholas. Typical. Rose? Funny, it's late. Hello? Hey come on. Oh fuck! - Yes? - Good morning. Mm, good morning. Breakfast is ready when you are. Thank you. There's a lot to take in, isn't there? Yeah. It seems too much for one woman on her own. But Nanna, she wanted the house to stay in our name. She was traditional, to put it mildly. I'm glad that you're here. My mom, this means a lot to her. We left here when I was a kid, started a life in the states. I thought coming back would be good for her but now it. We gotta own the path that was written for us. And you know that? I do. Many feel the light is hard to grasp, but the dark is, the devil has a language, it can speak, have thoughts. Do you understand? It has desires on us. That's all the proof I need. Has anyone seen Nicholas or Uncle Patrick? Uncle Patrick wants to eat in his room. - Oh and your brother? - No. Rose? I don't know, out for a run, he's dumb enough to go out at this time. I'm aware of that, thank you. - This is for you, Father. - Oh, thank you. Thanks. Where did you last see him? Hmm, Nick? Last night you were together. Oh yeah, and well, I went to bed but I think he kept playing for a bit longer. Ever tried calling him? Honestly, I'm sure he's just went out for a run or something. Are you concerned, Father? Yes, always when the devil is at work. I'll call him. Heaven please no. Oh my god! Oh no! So, I need everyone to listen to me. The devil is at work in this house. Your housekeeper. Her room was locked by your own hand, no less. We should call the police. No, the Church takes umbrage with the police getting invoked. They expect me to finish my task. And I'm sure they have just spoken with a lot of constables all ready. So Magda was bound and tied to a bed, half conscious after you slap the living crap out of her and yet you would rather blame her then call the police. Don't be ridiculous! It wants you to think that. - I'm sure he bloody does. - It. Secrets wait for us in plain sight. Light. This passage leads to the games room. Jesus. You killed my son, you killed my son! You'll see again, you'll see yourself won't you! Move! Are you gonna shoot me. You won't beat me. You won't beat me! You won't beat me! You won't beat me! You won't beat me! You won't beat me! and remove anything it can use against us. I will prepare my prayers. Tomorrow we will begin. You used a gun in my family home! And if I hadn't? When you come back out, the only thing I expect to see in your hand is a bloody Bible. Patrick? How does this work? My mom she's concerned. She should be. This isn't a sermon, this is a confrontation. How did you know about the secret passage? You were convinced of what happened without even spending a day here. Unless you've been here before. You have, when it was a school. That was a long time ago. I met my wife at this school when she was secretary here. While I tried to find a better path for myself. Without her, it wouldn't have been possible. You can tell your mother not to be concerned. She can trust in the Lord. And she can trust me. I need to be left alone. I'm not sure that's a good idea. Patrick. It's between us. - Dad. - Come on. I need an assistant. I'll be fine. I can't lose both of you. We need to act now. I'll be fine. From the book now. He's going to kill you! Our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name. I have deemed you to be possessed by the devil. They kingdom come, they will be done on Earth as it is in heaven. You must be separated from it at all costs. Give us this day our daily bread. Stand back satan. And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. I expell. Keep going! Keep going! For thine is the kingdom. This is pointless, everything about your faith is pointless. I expel thee. The power and the glory forever and ever. Out of her. Stand back satan. Stand back satan. Stand back satan. No! Oh my god. My nephew died and now Magda. What have you brought into this house, Father? You wish to blame me for the devil's work. We were in the same room. He's trying to help, Patrick. Oh, yes, the priest with the revolver. And you got that at seminary school, a graduation present perhaps. I'll take care of it now. See all safe. You can have it back shortly, once you've packed your things. My work is not finished. I tend to disagree. Whatever it was you claimed to be inside Magda is dead along with her. Your presence here is no longer acquired, Father. Mrs. Ketchick, she was an innocent, a puppet. The symbols in the drawing room, they were an instructor from the conjuring to the devil himself. A conjuror. Yes, the maid was bound when we found her. The real killer of Nick is still among us. Rubbish, you saw what she was capable of and she had easy access to the games room. Why don't you suspect her, Magda? I mean, if anyone was gonna conjure the devil, it'd be her, right? She was probably jealous of us and our money. Must have been hard for her to see it everyday. You were the last one with Nick, were you not? I don't see what good interrogating my daughter will do. What's wrong? The Father is going to be leaving shortly. It's not finished. Your disrespect of the Lord will not be tolerated. I intend to disagree, it is not the Lord - whom I'm disrespecting! - Patrick! Dad! No, you're done! Both of you. Father wait, they don't know. Funny, they do know, I told them. You said yourself that your work isn't done here. My mom needs this. We all make mistakes, Father. My brother just died, my grandmother. My mom is clearly struggling. How do you even process all of that? I know that she believes in what you're doing. And your uncle? I think you've shown you know how to deal with my uncle. Come to finish me off? No, it would be more embarrassing to let me lick my wounds. I have no interest in embarrassing you. I was asked to perform a ceremony nothing more. You should join me. I insist. I have something for you. Perhaps it's worth leaving in your suitcase next time. If the devil does in fact exist, I doubt he could be stopped by bullets. Do you take it everywhere you go? Right next to my Bible. Knowing Christine, we're lucky she didn't shoot one of us. I assume the safety was on. Safety. My sister is struggling to find peace. Your being here was meant to help her through this. May she get it, cheers. What do you think? Mother bought it for me last Christmas. Seems only right I should use it to say goodbye. I used to think this family was cursed. It's not just you. The world is cursed. Your reaction earlier surprised me. I thought maybe there was an air of rationality about you but your reaction. Whatever you saw, you've seen before. The devil and I. The devil, I'm sorry, it's not the devil. I laughed too until I saw it. I wasn't always a man of faith. Once upon a time I was a dealer, I dealt in drugs. And what led you to God? There was a young man I knew, a client, something takes him. First, I thought OD but then the devil face appeared to me. I saw this face again this night. In Magda? But why wouldn't it just take you over, if that's what it does? Faith, it knows I have a strength inside me. By trying to take my soul it would kill us both. You must allow me to continue my work. I shall retire now. Thank you. Father? How did you stop it the last time? I didn't. Thank you. The Lord is my strength and my soul. He has given me victory. This is my God and I praise him. The Lord is my strength and my soul. That was her favorite thing to say to me. And it seems it has found my weakness but you know me, I'm stubborn to say the least. I fear it may drove me into a bottle and I can't be. So, I need you to keep looking out for me just a bit longer, just a bit longer. No, not you! Time to get out of here. Okay. - What's going on? - No. - What? - No. - Let me through. - He said wait. - This is my house. - Mom, no! Oh my god, oh my god! It's best if you leave me. Patrick. To do what? I'm here to deliver this house from evil. Oh and good job you're doing. My house keeper, my son and now my brother are dead. You say you're here to drive evil away, well I'm beginning to think the opposite is true. And Nanna. Nanna had dementia, Rebecca, please don't interrupt. This is between the Father and I or at least it would be but I think we're done now. Unless of course you want me to involve the police. Come here, come here. That's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Wait, Father, my mother, she panics. Your mother is right to be angry. When the devil lives in this house inside one of you and it will remain until it's expelled. I'll call you once my mother's calmed down, Father. I found this. My uncle must have left it for you. Thank you. Father, I saw you kneeling over him, were you performing his last rites. The last rites are to be given to the living. Your Uncle's only mercy comes from the Lord now. Good day, Miss. Bishop. Father, my phone has been inundated. I hope it is to say you have completed your mission. But I am feeling doubtful. The situation has become complicated. My investigated has been overruled. - By whom? - The lady of the house. I see, well, if I've learned anything, if we have learned anything it's this that God has a plan for every one of us, that any hardships are just part of that plan. Andres, this must be explained to the lady, it must be explained with urgency that your work is not done and that it must be completed! The devil. Is our enemy, Andres, you have been asked to remove it. Do you understand? I shall hear from you when you are done. Dear Father, in times of darkness, we call upon the unknown to guide us. We look at the truth to set us free. My truth is that my life is a lie. My wife it's fair to say, she was never mine. And even fairer to say that Rose wasn't either. I felt that maybe there was a way of keeping this from Rose, at least her mother's indiscretions but I fear she's living her own life now and whatever it is that I wanted no longer matters. All I can hope is that you can find out what it is that she wants before it's too late. Honestly, I'm sure he's just going out for a run. Hello, officer? Oh Patrick just left actually. It must have been soon after I went to sleep last night. With my son, yes. Of course, I'll let him know that you want to speak to him as soon as he gets back. Thank you, goodbye. You lied. Oh, Rebecca, I didn't see you there. Why didn't you tell the police the truth? And what truth is that, dear? Your uncle is no longer with us, is he not? Yeah, but he didn't just disappear. Mom, he was killed. Oh. - Hi, Rebecca. - Rose. You know it's funny, all I ever wanted was to be apart of this family. Whatever I did I just didn't seem to fit in. So, I thought if they won't give me the life I deserve, then I'll just have to take it. Rebecca, Christine? Spirit I can feel your presence. I'm Father Andres Jozsef with the Catholic Church, decipher of the light against the darkness. I expend you from this home! Father. It's Rose, she's not well. I know. And she has my mother under a spell. It's all right child, the conjuror's going to leave here. But regardless of what she does, I need to get your out of here. Mom? She could have killed me, I was hoping you would come. I had to. Go through the safe door passage. - Go! - All right. Stand back satan, stand back Lucifer! Father! Is someone coming from the Church? The Church will no service they asked me here because they know they will have someone to blame if things go wrong and I came. Because you care. - My car's outside, go! - Okay. Father Andres Jozsef of the Catholic Church. I do not dare come you here satan. I will banish you satan. Evade from this home. Thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory. You cannot destroy me preach. You have fallen like me! Go, long live Jesus, long live Maria! Father. Mrs. Andiburg, conjurer. Stay back. Your cousin and father, you killed them. Nick, yeah. That was fun. Patrick, that was Christine. On my hand to god, Patrick wasn't my father. He raised you as if you was. There was no need for it all. That's rich since it's yours. The Lord is his for you. Bullshit! My mother and my real father, they left me. And Patrick and his people, they didn't want me. That's not true, Rose. I said stay back! My family wasn't suppose a family all I care about and taking back what they wanted to keep from me. Sweet Nana. The bitch wanted to keep this place in their family name. Well, imagine my surprise when I realized that didn't include me. You can't believe that, Rose, Nana loved you. I saw the will, Rebecca! Nana, Agnes. Agnes only loved her own grandchildren. All this time I felt like something wasn't right like I wasn't quite part of the family like I was being treated differently somehow. Well, I was right. That's why I turned to him, the dark lord. But he'd only give me what I want for you. The only man to have ever seen him and live. Stand back satan, I said stand back! Stand back. Feels hot take it. Stay back satan! No, it's me, you came for didn't you? Beliefeth Jesus God our savior and Virgin Mary. Expel thee! Calling for Michael the archangel, expel thee! Expel thee! Expel thee! Expel thee! Expel thee! Expel thee! Expel thee! Father. Father, I need to get you help. Please, please. The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. You've done well, Father. You have done well, Andres, I'm proud of you. Now it's time to return to you, my darling. I know my sweet love, soon. But there is still more work to do. Poor Rose. If we knew what she was going through, we could have helped her. Well, she'll have lots of time to think about that now. Hopefully the doctors can help. And if not? - I'll be right back. - Okay. She was a good woman. She still is. Looking out for me. She said there is still work to do. And you believe her? You should. Because she's right. What do you say once more for the cause dear Father?
