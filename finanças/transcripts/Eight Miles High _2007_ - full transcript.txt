No thanks, Dieter. For me, this is pure medicine. It gives me positive energy. Dammit! It's all Uschi's fault. She wears me out. I've no energy left. I did all I could. I got rid of the monkey... For six months I tried to turn her around. I tied her to the bed, I whipped her, raped her, dragged her throughout the apartment. Nothing. I don't know what to do. And I don't know what she wants. No idea what she wants. She's a cannibal, an evil witch. She'll eat you alive. But you know what, Rainer? I love her. I love her! Man, I've never loved a woman like I love her. But Dieter, what do you love about Uschi? I mean, what does she have that makes you say, let's go forward? I'm the one whose will... That's the real essence of it, isn't it? Everything. I love everything about her. Where is Uschi now? With the Stones, I think. Dammit! Come with me, Rainer. I want to show you something. Know what those are? Those are our scalps. Only shock therapy can help. How do you plan to shock her? You have the world's greatest man, you're a star yourself, everyone envies you... So? What if I want something else? I want to see the world, be free, not do the same old things. Concert, limousine. Concert, limousine. It's so boring! You know what? I think I miss Bockhorn. Bockhorn? No way! We were just talking about you. How'd you get my number? The bus is ready. I wanted to say bye. What? But I wanted to come along! I'm leaving without you. Go jump in a lake! But... hello? Hello! What is it? He's leaving without me. - What are you going to do? - I'm going to the airport. Yea, yeah, I'm coming. Hey guys, what do you want? What? I don't have the money! It's time you paid up! You can't just leave me alone with them! I'm going with you. Do you have everything? - My bag. - I got it. Caf? Adler doesn't exist anymore. Every week another dead body got carried out of there. Bockhorn has huge debts. They want the bus, and everyone's looking for him. We're heading out tomorrow. Bockhorn and I are leaving. He's taking me along. To India. Oh, it's you. Where did you come from? Is Bockhorn here? No, he's gone. He left already. What? Yeah, he's gone. He really left without me? Yeah. I'm sorry. Hey, Lurch! Lurchi, can you do me a favor? Whiskey's no good for polishing. I need the Polylux... I must say I am happy to see you. Wow... Amazing... I never thought it'd be this beautiful. Voil?! Unbelievable! How beautiful! - Just for you, Witch. - A radio! All for you. Amazing. Really, you... I don't know what to say. Now you see what your good-for-nothing man can do. You're so beautiful. What's going on around here? They're all just jealous, the fools. They want my money. And the bus. But they won't get it. They won't get us. Stay in touch! USCHI OBERMAIER AND THE PRINCE What's that you're tearing up? My contract with Ponti. Not another road toll... Get rid of it, Uschi! Obermaier! Obermaier, throw the dope away! No way. It would be truly barbaric to get rid of it. Lot of good it'll do you when you're rotting in jail. And I know that this is the worst border in the world. Then we'll just put it in here. Yeah, chill out. Yeah, no worries. Just keep cool. Hey, get your grimy fingers off of me! I said, get your grimy fingers off of me, okay? Uschi, bring me the photo! You're the best old lady ever! The best! Unbelievable! Bockhorn, this here is paradise. Don't dream your life, live your dream. USCHI OBERMAIER AND THE PRINCE CONQUER THE WORLD LIVING THE DREAM OF A GENERATION INDIA, 1975 Uschi, come here, quick! He wants to show us something! You won't believe this! That's the goddess Kali. She looks just like you, except that I still have my head. Eh, Witch? King of St. Pauli! I don't want to get married! Why not? What is it? What if they find out? Find out what? That you're no Prince, and I'm no Princess. But we are. Just look at us! We are! Brass band... the works! It's only symbolic! A performance. Come on. You're completely stoned! Bockhorn sweet-talked the Maharani into giving us a full fairy-tale wedding. But I realized that for him, it was more than just a performance. And though I loved Bockhorn more than anything, I never wanted to belong to one man alone. Look, it's Uschi! Hey, kids! I have more in the bus. I'll get more if... I'm going to be a father! A father! Bockhorn? Bockhorn? Bockhorn? Bockhorn! Bockhorn! Why did you lock me in? What is it? What happened? Because you're my wife, and we're having a baby! That doesn't make me your prisoner! It was to protect you! Bockhorn? Bockhorn... It's alright. It's alright now. You can be proud of yourself. You did that like a nomad. We'll make a new one, okay? We won't have another child. I'm not a mother. Sleep. Let's get out of here. Off we go. Hello? Can I ask you a few questions? Miss Obermaier, would you answer a few questions? Please! We'd lost our child. I felt fear for the first time. Bockhorn always said to look your fear in the eye and the fear will disappear. And so we drove on. To the end of the world. Following the endless summer. MEXICO, 1983 Lurchi, go see if there's enough firewood, and if everyone has enough to drink. What a long trip it's been, eh, Witch? But it's not over yet. We'll do something new, something different. Yeah, something new and different. Really different. No more strife. I always thought I had to be stronger than you. But that's impossible. You're the strongest old lady ever. What's wrong with you? Nothing. It's all good. I'm going back down to the beach. You coming? Bockhorn, come here! Look who's here! Bockhorn, Keith. Keith, Bockhorn. He just happened to be here. Oh, yeah? You don't really believe that? You know what? You can have whoever you want. You do anyway. Bockhorn, that's not what this is about. Lurchi, you old dumbass! Tommi, you stupid... Stop, you're hurting yourself! Thank you, sir. Thank you. Lurchi, give me the knife. You're going to slit its throat? No need for that. You don't even know how. - You're not riding with me... - Why not? You ride with the others. Get off! I want to ride with you, not with the others! Come on! Please! Viva Zapata! Viva Zapata! Have you see Bockhorn? He left that way on the motorcycle. No! No! No! No! No! Leave me alone! In the course of a single night, I lost the two most important men in my life. The freedom I'd always dreamed about and lived, suddenly seemed like a curse. Suddenly it had turned into loneliness. I could feel that he still loved me. I thanked him for everything he gave me during the life we shared. I told him that I could've been a little nicer to him, instead of being an egotistical monster. I regretted not telling him more often how much I loved him. But now he was just lying there, and it was too late. I asked myself if I could've done anything differently. And my answer was... no. Today, Uschi Obermaier is a successful jewelry designer living in a small villa in Topanga Canyon, between Santa Monica and Malibu.
