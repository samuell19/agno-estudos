(gentle music) (upbeat music) (seagulls squawking) - [Al] I work for the New York State Tax Department, which is the single worst job you could possibly have. I mean, let's face it, everybody hates the tax man. It's biblical. (group chattering) (brooding music) There were rumors in the Brighton Beach Russian community that a mysterious money guy had put together a multimillion dollar scam. I guess I could have sat on my ass in my office doing crossword puzzles, shaking down little shopkeepers who were later on their sales tax, but I would've gone insane. So I hit the streets looking for something that would get me outta bed every morning, something that could change my life. And I figured that finding this mystery man could be my big break. (camera snaps) One of my prime suspects was a fellow named Grisha Gold, president of a small gasoline company Mars. He was only in the country two years already acting like a regular Rockefeller, buying up large numbers of independent gas stations. (camera snaps) (man speaking in Russian) (man 2 speaking in Russian) (man singing in foreign language) (car door bangs) I was also following Gold's employees hoping to stumble on a lead. (man speaking in Russian) (car engine roaring) (tires screeching) Go, go, go, go for Christ sake. (car engine roaring) - Seven Charlie, this is Central. We got a 1020 at 1430 Brighton Sixth Street, repeat. (police radio chattering) Seven, this is Central, we got a 1010. Shots fired at 1350 Brighton Beach Avenue at Mars. Acronym from Metropolitan and Malcolm Refinery Service. (siren wailing) (police radio chattering) (group chattering) (car door bangs) - [Reporter] Anderson, Brighton Beach. I am outside the small tucked away office of a local petroleum organization. - Excuse me, please. - Called Mars. - Excuse me. - What the fuck is with you people? Whose fucking cigarette is this? What are you smoking a goddamn dead men's cigarettes? Don't fucking look at me. Take the goddamn pictures. Jesus. All right, who's collecting shells? Who is collecting shells? Am I talking to myself here? Look at this. Jesus. This is all these fucking people think about. They got no morality. They're just godforsaken fucking commies. Should've fucking dropped a bomb on the whole fucking country. - This says. (speaking in Russian) It's a sales journal. - Hey, Phil, come here. Look at this. Probably somebody doing business. - [Phil] Made a robbery on the wall. - [Nunzio] These people could be involved with night clubs. - [Phil] Maybe they got extorted and they wouldn't pay. - Hey, hey, watch it. - Excuse me. - Hey, hey, I told you people, I have as much right to be here as you do, all right? - I'm sure you do. Joseph Romero. - Oh, sorry. Al Benjamin, state tax. What a mess, huh? - Yeah. - Somebody gonna really feel stupid. - Somebody? - Yeah, my boss. I've been sitting on these people five months now. But you guys, anyway, you're gonna be putting together a case now, and I figure I can show you my notes, my surveillance photos. - Oh, these guys are just, they're just in, in gasoline. Nothing bigger than that. - Yeah, I know. And I know six people, you think they get slaughtered over, over drugs something, right? Nothing as common as gasoline. Let me, let me show you this. Did you see this? This is weird. This place is called Mars, but the invoice is made out to another company. Company I never heard of, El Dorado Petroleum. Geofuel's a huge Fortune 500 company. Look. Look at these numbers. - Who the fuck is this guy? - [Al] This is good. - Hey, what the fuck are you doing? Put that down, that's evidence hasn't been dusted yet. Who the are you anyway? - He, he, he's been- - Yeah, wise guy. Are you homo-homo-homicide? You're down here because you speak a little Russian, all right? So mind your own fucking business. Keep out of the way. You're here to interpret, not investigate. Phil, come here. You're a tax collector. This is a homicide investigation, you don't belong here. If you came the audit these guys, I'd say you were a little late. (Phil laughs) - I, I don't, I don't do audits, okay? I'm an investigator. I'm investigating a crime just like you. - I don't want a fucking argument from you. I want you outta here now. - Don't touch me. - Get this desk jockey the fuck out of here. - Let me tell you something. - Hey, you get outta here this minute. I'll lock your ass up you little fucking tax collector cocksucker! - Tax investigator, all right? - Get the fuck out of here. - Investigator, all right? - [Man] Hey, lady, watch it, huh! - [Woman] Hey, take a hike! - I got six dead bodies. I got two invoices that are potentially hard evidence- - Six frickin' homicides here, Al, remember? - Five months I've been- - This case. - Working on this right? - Yeah, five months on a mythical case you keep telling me about. And every time I keep asking you, you say, well, I'm not sure what the case is. - Well, now I'm sure. - And quite honestly, I'm sick and fucking tired- - Now I'm sure. - Of you charging windmills instead of doing you goddamn job! - Yeah, hello, it's Al Benjamin, state tax. Look, I need papers and incorporation for a company called El Dorado Petroleum. More importantly, uh, I need to know who the corporation officers are. - [Clerk] The officers of El Dorado Petroleum. - Right. - [Clerk] I have to send it out by mail you now, sir. - [Al] Is there any chance I can get it sooner? (train rattling) - [Announcer] Next stop North Paige. Next stop Brighton Paige. (birds chirping) - How you doing today? - How you doing? - I'm doing all right. Listen, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm really sorry about, about the episode yesterday. You know, my captain can be kind of a dick, you know? - Kind of a dick? - Yeah. - The guy should be fitted for a rubber. - Yeah, um, don't take it personally. You know, he's like that with everybody, and, and- - Look, I know why you're here, okay? Your boss, he finally figures out that maybe I know something after all, so he sends you to pick my brain. He's too fucking embarrassed to come to me. But you tell him it's too late, all right? - No, no, you don't- - Tell him he can- - Understand. - Kiss my tuchus. - Your what? - My tuchus. Tell him to kiss my ass, all right? - All all right, I'll tell him but- - Yeah, you tell him that. - I came here, I just want you to know I came here on my own. I mean, I mean, no one sent me. I, I, I'm- - What? - I came here on my own. No own sent- - He doesn't know you're here? - No, this is, this is totally unauthorized. And, and, and, and, and what you said last night, it was, I thought it was very interesting. And, and, and I thought maybe I can come down here and, and, and talk to you and, and, you know, jump in with you and, and see where it goes. - [Al] Jump in where? - [Joseph] I can translate for you. - I don't need a translator. - I've been taking Russian classes. - By the way, what's a DOA guy? - When homicide comes in and cleans out the crime scene I, I, I, I make sure no one molest the body. - Molest the body? You mean somebody wants to sleep with a dead person? - No, you know, sometimes freaking wanna come in and, and, and rob the guy and I- - Oh. - I make sure that- - Shitty job. - Yeah, you're telling me. Anyways, look, there's gonna be tons of paperwork. I can organize it for you. I can run plates for you when I'm on duty. - I can run plates myself. - And, and, I'm really smart. I got best marks at the academy- - That's nice. - On all my written tests. - What the hell are you doing with the worst job in the precinct? - I don't know, maybe they don't like Puerto Ricans or something. - Oh, bullshit. You're telling me there's no Puerto Rican detectives. You fucked up. - No, I did not. - You fucked up. - I didn't fuck up. All right, so there's a couple things I didn't do so good. - Like what? - I have a hard time hitting the target and, and, and, and I don't drive so well. - Oh, great, great. You can't shoot, you can't drive. Is there anything else you can't do? (woman speaking in Russian) (speaking in Russian) Okay, show me some Russian. What she saying? (woman speaking in foreign language) - She's saying that he cheated on her and, and, and he broke her heart. (woman speaking in Russian) (man speaking in Russian) - Imagine being with a woman like that. - Nah, she'd scare the hell out of me. I want, I want a nice, nice Catholic girl. You know, a virgin. Hey, you don't want, you don't want to get involved in that. - Hey, hey, hey! Take it, take it, take it easy, all right? Take it easy. - Mind your fucking business, this is my fucking fiance. - All right, take it easy. I just don't want to- - Would you please mind your own business, please? - Just take it easy, all right? Looks like you're gonna hurt her. Calm down. - What do you think I can't take care of myself? Please. (speaking in Russian) - Sorry. What are you gonna do, right? - You always do crazy things like that? - What do you mean? What's crazy about hopping out a woman that's in trouble? - So what about it? - What? - You and me working on the case, you know, Sherlock and Watson. - You mean more like Abbott and Costello. (group chattering) So wanna know why six people got themselves killed over something as common as gasoline? - Yeah. - Well, it's not the gasoline people are getting killed over. It's the taxes. Some criminal mastermind figured out how to steal taxes off gasoline. - But that's only a few cents a gallon, right? - Right, right, 27 cents to be exact. But if you figure that the average gas station sells 10,000 gallons a day, well that's almost a million dollars a year in taxes. And let's suppose a crime organization owns a hundred gas stations. That's a hundred million dollars a year pure profit. Now ain't that a motive for murder? - Yeah, but how are they, how are they doing it, the, the stealing part? - Well, I don't know. That's what we gotta figure out. (brooding music) (man speaking in foreign language) The six murders at Mars did not slow the rapid expansion of their gas station empire. Within a week, they set up a shop in a dumpy back office at one of their gas stations. I was wondering if whoever killed these people would make another move. What? - It's just me. (car door clicks) What are you a scaredy cat? Man, at the deli there was this blonde lady with nice big vavooms. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. Vavooms? - Yeah, you know vavooms. - I know what vavooms are. (gentle brooding music) Look at these guys. Telling you something's up. New guy running Mars was a character called Topolev. He used to work for Gold and just happened to be out of the office at the time of the killings. Now this guy was either very lucky, or maybe the late Grisha Gold trusted him just a little too much. Topolev spent most of his time going to small independent gas stations offering to buy them out. And just like I figured, the more gas stations you have, the more taxes you can steal. (car door clicks) (car door bangs) (car door bangs) (camera clicks) (Abrasha speaking in Russian) (Andre speaking in Russian) (Abrasha speaking in Russian) (Andre speaking in Russian) (drill whirring) (group chattering) All right, Mr. Vavoom, the mail just got here. - [Joseph] Stop calling me that. - (chuckles) And the drum roll please. I think we got ourselves a president. Oh, that's strange. - What? - [Al] El Dorado, it only has one corporate officer. - [Joseph] What's his name, Al? - Uh, one Misha Baruchin. - It's Misha Baruchin, Al. It's pronounced Baruchin. - Well, thank you Mr. Berlitz. This could be our guy. All right, look, I got an address on the corporation headquarters. It's 121 16th Street in Brooklyn. I'm gonna go over there now. This could be everything, baby. - Wait, wait. You can't go without me, come on. I can't get outta here right now. And, and, and, and I got a day off tomorrow. We can go tomorrow. Come on, Al, we're in this together now. - Hey. Not a personal call I hope. - No, sir. - Here's a buck, got to the machine, get me a coffee. Light two sugars. Can you handle that without fucking up? - Yes, sir, in a minute. - [Nunzio] Hey, Donnie, leave a message for my wife. (traffic humming) - [Joseph] So what do you think this Misha Barucin's gonna be like? - I don't know. But he's gonna be surprised to see us. And I'll tell you something else. I bet their offices are waist deep in cash. We're gonna need a fucking life preserver just to swim through it. - So with all the, with all this cash, I mean, you think there's gonna be a lot of guns and stuff? I mean, 'cause I didn't bring my bulletproof vest and- - Vests? We don't need no stinking vests. Why do you wanna be a cop anyway? I mean, you worry all the time. You're a smart guy, you could be a CPA. You could make a lot more money. - [Joseph] You sound like my mother. We're looking for 121, right? - Uh. - 127. - [Al] You sure this is the right street? - 125, 123. Here, 119. - 119. - Wait, stop, stop. Back it up, back up. That's it. - 119. Fuck. - That's it. (car door clicks) (man speaking in Russian) (car door bangs) (car door bangs) - These guys are a lot smarter than I thought. A lot smarter. (man speaking in Russian) They got a whole corporation registered to an empty lot. This Misha Baruchin is our mystery man all right. 6,600 state employees in the tax department and that one person thought to check. (thunder rumbling) I can't understand why Geofuel would do business with a phantom company. - That's creepy. - Bingo. Double bingo, baby. Look what I just pulled out of Brooklyn Surrogate Court. El Dorado purchase deeds. - Oh, wow. - 380 count 'em gas stations. - And you know who sold them those gas stations? - Geofuel, yeah, yeah. - Geofuel. So what we got here is a financially troubled large corporation. - Right. - Who's trying to save itself. They sell their stations to Misha, he transfers ownership of the stations to Mars. So if his tax scam is uncovered, he can't be implicated. - Yes. I can see the press conference now. Headlines read, NYPD joker, tax man topple vicious Russian crime circuit. - All right, but hold off with the toppling, okay. So Geofuel keeps supplying gasoline even though they know El Dorado's a phantom company because Misha probably cuts them in on the profits. - Right, right, right. - This Misha's a genius. - [Al] I was feeling great. Best I've felt in years. - [Reporter] Benjamin, Benjamin, please. (cameras snapping) (group chattering) Over here please, sir. - [Reporter 2] Benjamin! - [Al] So I pull up, I see Geofuel barges offloading into Mars trucks. I say to myself, wow, the vavoom-meister's absolutely right. Geofuel's supplying Mars with gasoline, but they're invoicing El Dorado Petroleum. So on paper, there's never any connection between Geofuel and Mars. I went to see the Geofuel terminal manager, but he was way too busy to see me. So I said, fine. I'll subpoena his ass. (door creaking) - [Boss] Get him out of here, Neals! (Al yelling) - [Al] In my office none of my bosses would back me up. They wouldn't issue a subpoena. Nobody wanted to take on Geofuel. I get into a huge fight, but it didn't do me any good. - Get out of here. Jules Pfizer runs this whole place. Shut the fuck up. - Not bailing my case. - Al, I said, shut the fuck up. It's just work. It does not matter. - Just work? - Yeah, it's just work. - Mike, six people got killed- - Jesus Christ! - At Mars, okay? Six. You're telling me that doesn't matter, right? - Six Russians died- - What about the- - And yes, Al, it does not matter. Six Russians that doesn't matter. Now grow the fuck up! - Let me tell you something, all right? When I was a kid growing up, you think I wanted this? You think think I wanted to be a tax man? Fuck no, but that's what I am, all right. That's what I do. And you think I'm gonna take this fucking shit? You're crazy. - Al, go home. You've been talking about fixing that debt for five years. Take a week, hell take two weeks off. - Fucking bullshit. - God knows how much time you've saved up. And you haven't even used the vacation. - Hey, yo, watch where you're going man. - Get on the freaking street. - How you doing again, sir? - Not a bike path. - How you doing today, sir? Wanna try, take a look over here, sir. Huh, 20 bucks, sir. - Leather jacket for you bro, huh? - Hey, yo, you want a magazine, man. Punk ass. - I can't get through. - What's this guy doing? - Street work, don't you see we're working? - Hey this is a sidewalk, okay? - Who the fuck asked you? - Sidewalk is for pedestrians. Move the boxes. - Fuck that. - Move the boxes, it's illegal. You're breaking the law, it's illegal. - Who gives a shit, fucking asshole? - Who are you calling an asshole? - You! - Who's gonna move the boxes? You or me? - Nobody, walk. (glass shattering) - [Al] Move the box. - [Man] What are you fucking nuts? - [Al] Move the box! (bodies thud) Move the box, goddammit! - No, no, no, no! Fucking crazy! Stop! - I work for the people goddammit! - Stop it! - I work for the people! - What are you nuts? - You're a street, you hear me? You're all fucking streets! You're all fucking streets! - I said stop it! - [Al] My once in lifetime big break was dying on me. And only a miracle could save it. (group chattering) (upbeat music) My miracle was a guy called Andre. He owned 16 gas stations and was like some kind of papa bear for the people who worked for him. If somebody had a sick wife or kid in college needed some extra money, he'd take care of it for him. - How's the baby? - Fine. - Your wife, she get enough help? - Yeah, she okay. - If you have to go home early you just tell me. There's no trouble, no problem, okay? - Okay, Andre. - Okay. - Thank you. (water splashing) - [Al] This guy could teach a class on how to enjoy life. He'd make his rounds to all the gas stations, collect the cash, then he'd head right to the Russian baths for a swim. Rub down, maybe a little borscht. (Andre speaks in Russian) (men speaking in Russian) - So you want to hear joke? Funny joke? What has six balls and fucks you? Lotto. (woman and Andre laughing) (group chattering) (laughing) Lotto. (Andre laughing) (woman screams) (gun banging) (Andre groaning) (glass shattering) (Andre grunts) (coffee splashes) (man screams) (man grunting) (gun clangs) (Andre grunting) (water splashing) (gun banging) (man speaking in Russian) (gun clicking) - [Al] Andre was shot three times. Later he said, "The bullets got lost in 220 pounds of Russian muscle." Somehow he was able to survive. The interesting thing was, ballistics show that the bullets removed from Andre were fired from the same weapons used as the Mars killings. Romero IDed Andre from my surveillance photo as one of the guys that Topolev was trying to muscle out. Romero also said he could finagle me into seeing Andre. (car door bangs) - [Joseph] So how you been? - Um, lousy. Really depressed, you know, suicidal at times. But tell you the truth, I didn't even think I ever see you again. - Yeah, well, nobody's embarrassed me for a whole week. (Al chuckles) Guess I'm a masochist. So, oh, you know what? I gotta, I was running late. I didn't have a chance to change. And I don't want to go in there like this. So, you know, pull up somewhere. - No, change in the car. - This car's filthy, I'm not gonna change in here. - No, change- - Just pull up somewhere, a restaurant or something. - What you're afraid I'm gonna like get turned on? - Are you saying something here, Al? - What? - Because I don't think it's very funny. (Al laughing) - What do you think I think you're a pillow biter? - Hey, lots of guys don't like to take their clothes off in front of other guys. I mean, I mean, who wants to see what another guy's, what another guy's got? - For what it's worth- - And, and, and- - It wouldn't bother me. Wouldn't bother me if you were gay for what it's worth. - Kiss my tacos, Al. - Tuchus, tuchus. How many times they gonna tell you, shmuck? - You know, you're very, very emotionally disturbed. - Thanks for noticing. Ah, so what a blow job's out of the question? - That's not funny, Al. I'm serious. (Al laughing) (slow tempo brooding music) (Andre speaking in Russian) (Nadia speaking in Russian) Mr. Rubakov. (speaking in Russian) (Andre speaking in Russian) - Al Benjamin. - His daughter Nadia. - Hi. - I remember you, the boardwalk. - Right, right. You still mad at me? - You know my daughter? - No, not really. I mean, we, well, we met, but not. (Andre coughing) (Nadia speaking in Russian) - [Joseph] Al, she wants us to leave. - Look, look, I just, I wanna ask him a couple of questions. I'm not gonna tire you out, promise. So, so where are you from in Russia? - Kyiv. - Kyiv, (chuckles) Kyiv. Joe, my grandfather on my mother's side is from Kyiv. Kyiv. Man, he was a tailor in the Czar's army. So listen, if you don't mind, I, I'd really like to talk to your father alone. (Joseph speaking in Russian) Yeah. (speaks in Russian) You know, three minutes, nothing. Please. Thanks. Thanks a million. Thank you. - [Nurse] Dr. Melve to respiratory therapy. Dr. Melve to respiratory therapy. - Your daughter, she's, she's very beautiful. I mean, don't get me wrong, I look, I don't touch. Married 14 years never once. - Not once? - No, no, regrettably no. You? - I'm human. - Wife know how human you are? So this is why I came to see you. I'm an investigator with state tax. Here let me do that. And well, frankly, I'm not interested in the guys that tried to kill you. More interested in the fellas than put 'em up to it. Um, I thought maybe he'd be interested in a little payback without having going on record of course. Now what we got so far is a partnership between the major American corporation and a Russian criminal who's trying to lay his hands on as many gas stations as he can. - I don't understand what you want. - Well, the American oil company, we can't really touch. But the Russian guy, this guy, he's a fair game. - [Andre] But what do you want from me? - We want you to point us in the right direction. You think about it, you know, I'll be in touch. (group screaming) You want me to get rid of that for you? (man yelling) - What is the window doing open? (door bangs) - Take care. (window bangs) (door clicks) (Joseph speaks in Russian) (gentle brooding music) - [Joseph] Thank you. (door bangs) (Andre groaning) (Nadia speaking in Russian) (speaking in Russian) (speaking in Russian) (Andre speaking in Russian) (Nadia speaking in foreign language) (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) (bell ringing) (brooding music) (thunder rumbling) - [Al] Brighton Beach is a very small community, and I figured Andre had to know who this Misha Baruchin was. All I had to do was figure out a way to get Andre to talk. (camera snaps) (car door clicks) I was surprised to see Nadia pull into her father's gas station. I admired her courage, her loyalty to her father. But I also remembered Topolev trying to extort Andre and I thought she was putting herself in great danger. So I decided to stay close to her for a few days. (seagulls squawking) (dog barking) (gentle music) (camera snaps) (camera snaps) (camera snaps) (traffic humming) (camera snaps) (man speaking in Russian) (gentle brooding music) (camera snaps) (doorbell rings) - Who is it? - [Al] Al Benjamin. (locks clicking) How you doing? (lock clicks) - [Nadia] Good. Come in. - How's your dad? - He's better, but not good yet. - Well, he's a, he's a tough guy. He's gonna be okay. I got these. - Thank you. - I thought they, I thought they might cheer him up. (woman speaking in Russian) So this is a nice place you have here. - Thank you. - You know, you speak very good English. You mind my asking, do you go to school or you go to college? - I did one year, but it wasn't for me. - [Natalia] Nadia. (speaks in Russian) - [Al] Hi. - Hey. (chuckles) This is my sister, Natalia. - Oh, Natalia. Nadia, Natalia, very, very pretty names. We should all stay this way forever. (Nadia speaks in Russian) Andre, how you doing? No, no, no, please don't get up. - It's okay. I want to be able to stand when I give my daughter away. Plus it's very bad luck to postpone a wedding. - Yeah, it's also bad luck that your stitches burst. - You should come to the wedding, please. - No, no, no, I'd be outta place. - No, now that I have invited you to the wedding, it would be very bad luck if you did not come. - Why? - Russians invite everyone to wedding. Super, you know, fate. Not exactly fate. (speaking in Russian) - Superstition. - Oh yeah, okay. (Nadia speaking in Russian) We got you, we got you. - Please, I do not mean to be too rude, but you cannot stay too long. - No, no, I won't, I won't. - Nadia. So my accountant tells me that somebody from state tax wants to audit my returns. (Al chuckles) Is this you? - Yeah, it's me. I ran you through the computer, Andre. You got a few problems. You've never filed on your corporate taxes. You've never paid sales tax. - Big deal. State tax is one year maximum. I do this standing on my head. - Okay, but there's also a federal tax on gasoline, and you haven't filed on that either. And guess what the conspiracy count on that is? It's eight years. Your head's gonna be awfully sore. (man singing in Russian) You ever hear a quid pro quo? (man singing in Russian) You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Everybody scratches. (man singing in Russian) (Andre chuckling) - You do your job very well, tax man. But this is not a very good time. We must wait for the wedding first. This is most important to me. Then later, like you said, you do me a little favor, I do you a little favor. (Andre speaking in Russian) (Nadia laughs) (man speaking in Russian) (Andre speaking in Russian) (camera snaps) (Nadia speaking in Russian) (Andre speaking in Russian) (Nadia speaking in Russian) (camera snaps) - [Joseph] Ah, we shouldn't be here. This isn't right, Al. - [Al] Why? - [Joseph] Because I can get in big trouble for doing this. - [Al] What, for going to a wedding? - I shouldn't have listened to you. Socializing with these people is totally crossing the line, Al. - Look Mr. Joseph, please. We're going to a wedding for crying out loud. We're gonna meet big Russian women with humongous vavooms. - I don't want a big Russian woman with big vavooms. I want a nice Catholic girl. - Yeah, well, same difference. Give me 20 bucks. You're carrying a gun. - [Joseph] These people are dangerous, Al. You're gonna go in there without a gun. - Yes. - Go, go get your gun, Al. - No. - I'm serious. I'm not going in there unless you get your gun. This is Brighton Beach for Christ's sake. (glass shatters) - [Guest] Mazel tov! (group singing in foreign language) (fast tempo upbeat music) (group chattering) (Andrea speaking in Russian) (Nadia speaking in Russian) (Andre speaking in Russian) (Nadia speaking in Russian) - Hey, tax man! At my daughter with you must not drink beer. You must drink champagne. I insist. And you, you must dance. - Oh, no, no, thank you. - Marsha. Marsha! - This isn't part of the investigation. I'm not gonna go dancing. - Take her for a spin. Go dancing. - I don't wanna take her for a spin. - Take her, take her. - Go, go enjoy yourself. - [Joseph] Al. (man singing in Russian) - Now what about you, tax man? - No, I, I don't dance. I never learned how. - You know how to fuck? - No, I'm a married guy. - Dancing is like fucking. Your hips moving with the partner. See, it's natural. - I can't, I can't. (man singing in Russian) (fast tempo upbeat music) Hello. - Hello. - You look beautiful. - You are not enjoying yourself. - No, I am, I am, I am. - You don't dance? - No. - You should try. (man singing in Russian) (camera snaps) Now just follow me and do everything I do. - Okay. - [Nadia] Back, side, together. - Yeah. - Front, side, pause. Back, side, pause. - Pause. - Front, ow, ow! - Sorry, sorry, sorry. I told you I'm a klutz. - What that six balls and fucks you? - What? - Lotto. - My father is like a big bear, always makes me laugh. Helps everybody. Have a drink. (man singing in Russian) (group clapping) (man singing in Russian) (man singing in Russian) (camera snapping) - [Guest] Come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on. (man singing in Russian) (man singing in Russian) (Andre laughing) (man singing in Russian) (man singing in Russian) (hands clapping) (man singing in Russian) (man singing in Russian) (man singing in Russian) (man singing in Russian) (group clapping) - Thank you, nice meeting you. (guest and Andre speaking in Russian) (guest speaking in Russian) (Andre speaking in Russian) (guest 2 speaking in Russian) - Ah, tax man, you have good time? - Yeah. - Oh, I have something for you. This is for your wife. - So when are we gonna get together? - Whenever. Whenever you like, you know where I am. - All right. I'll bring the bagels. - Thanks, Mr. Rubakov. (woman speaking in Russian) (brooding music) (traffic humming) This guy, Andre, he's a nice guy, huh? - Yeah, he is. That was a great wedding. - Yeah. - Nice family. - Uh-huh. - [Joseph] Got a nice daughter. - Beautiful daughters. - You know, if we put this guy in a public trial, you know, we can get him, we can get him killed. - Hey, hey! (car horn honking) - Sorry, sorry. - God, if these guys wanted him dead, they'd stick him in a car with you. - Just you know, if if if these guys, they could, they, they could wipe out his whole family, you know? - Wait. - And, and, and make an example of him. - Hey, wait a minute. Did I tell him to cheat on his taxes, huh? Did I tell this guy to be a crook? - No, still the guy's got a nice family. - I know that. Goddammit, don't you think I know that? Don't you think I admire it? I don't know what's gonna happen to Andre. What I do know is you and me, we started this thing and now it's too late. I can't stop. I can't stop. (bells ringing) (birds chirping) Do you know Misha Baruchin? Do you know anybody that might know Misha Baruchin? - Sorry, but I do not know this- - You're a fucking liar. - Misha Baruchin. - You're a fucking liar. I don't believe a word you're saying. - Would you give him a chance? - You tell me how to find this guy or I swear to God, I'll throw you in fucking jail. You're never gonna get out. - Andre, it's not worth spending eight years in jail. - [Al] Eight years away from your family, Andre. Eight. - You just, just, just tell us what we need to hear and we'll be outta here. - You have to believe me. I do not know him. - Fuck this, fuck this, I'm getting a warrant. I can't believe this motherfucker is jerking us off. Let's go. - You gotta tell us something here. - I swear to you on my daughter's life, I do not know this Misha Baruchin. - [Al] See how you like jail, Andre. - But I will tell you something about these people. There's a big man who, who puts a deal with Geofuel is a kapusta. - Kapusta, you mean like cabbage? - Duh, like, like cabbage. - Oh, great you're gonna sell fucking vegetables now. - No, no, no, no, no, no. Cabbage like money. - Green money. It's, it's so, this kapusta. - He came here with many international connections. Some say that he was KGB. Who knows? - So is it, is it possible that this, this cabbage, this kapusta is Misha Baruchin? - I do not know this Misha Baruchin. What, where do you get this name from? - The corporate papers. He's an officer, president of El Dorado Petroleum. (Andre laughing) What the fuck is he laughing about? - Andre, there's nothing funny here. (Andre laughing) - The man on the papers is a gornisht. (Andre laughing) - Gornisht? - Nothing it means. It's Yiddish. - Yes, nothing, a zero. The lowest guy. He exists as a. (speaks in Russian) You know, like a fake beard. He, he's someone they can put on the plane back to Russia if the authorities get too close. This way, they can never make the connection between this man and the kapusta. - Misha Baruchin is a nobody. He's a buffer. But who's the kapusta? What's his name? Is it possible that Grisha Gold was the kapusta? - No, the kapusta would never be so close to the operation. Gold ran Mars was the kapusta. Then Gold wanted to start his own operation. This was a big mistake. - So the kapusta sets up Gold to be killed. - I believe the kapusta brought two killers from the Republic of Chechnya. (brooding music) These are people who are exposed to poison gas during the uprising. They know they're going to die so they don't give a shit about anything. They have no fear. - Are they the same guys who shoot you? - Maybe. What's the difference? - So now we're looking- - [Al] What Andre gave us was big, bigger than anything that I could ever imagine. We needed help. What we needed was a prosecutor. Since state prosecutors were indifferent to this case, we thought we shop it around in federal court. Well, we found it wasn't an easy sell. If you're a US attorney, you're not gonna make any major career moves prosecuting Russians. Their ticket to fame and glory are the big romantic godfather type organized crime cases. Five different prosecutors told us to take a hike. Finally, Romero said he heard of this guy called Peyton Cody. He was prosecuting a case in Brooklyn. - All right, I gotta go to little boy's room. I'll see in a minute. I'll be in there. - Mr. Cody, listen. - Hi. Al Benjamin, state tax department. I'd like to talk about a case I'm putting together, okay? - Guys, I don't have time. - And they told me to find you here. - It's very important. - Sir, this involves hundreds of millions of dollars. Taxpayer's money could be used in good public use. - Guys, I really don't have time. - Russian hoods and, and corporate assholes started it. - Huge corporate assholes. - And I can get you the headlines, sir. Washington Post, New York Times. - Guys, guys, I'd really like to help but I don't have the time. I don't have the time. It's been good talking with you. - Let's go. - Wait a minute. Guy's trying to go to the bathroom, man. - Right, right. And I have his undivided attention. I'm taking full advantage. Let's go. - Oh, Jesus. - Mr. Cody. Mr. Cody. Uh, Mr. Cody, look, I, I, I know this is not the, the most opportune time, sir, but I really would like to talk to you about this case. - No, this is not the time. Look, look, look, I, I don't do tax evasion cases. Uh, thank you. - But, sir, this is not your normal tax case, sir. If you don't have anything to read in there, just take, take a look at this, will you, sir? It's a summary of the case and it was prepared by my brilliant colleague, detective in training Joseph Romero. And Detective Romero would be happy to talk you through the case, sir. - Are you insane? - Uh, thank you, but I don't need anything to read. - But sir, let me just explain something to you, okay? We nail these guys, we save the taxpayers millions of dollars, sir. Just, just look. I mean, I know you gotta do your business. Do your business. Detective Romero and I- - Mr. Cody. - We have no problem with that, sir. - I'd just like to let you know that- - No problem at all. - I think this is a complete invasion of a guy's privacy. I mean, I, I I realize this is not the right, the right time. And maybe. - I'm making a presentation. I rehearsed it, okay? - Um. - Look, all- - Sir, we've established a paper trail that we believe is the link. - [Al] Right, paper trail, sir. - All right, I can't, I can't take it. (door creaking) - Guys, this is not the time. - All right, listen, look, I understand that, sir. Look, I mean, take your time. You wash your hands. Look, this is a very sexy case. - Look guys, look guys, look guys, I don't have time. Good luck with your case. Good luck. (door clicks) (ominous music) (man laughing) - [Al] I've always believed perseverance creates opportunity. No matter how hopeless the situation seemed. I didn't feel desperate. Well, maybe it had something to do with that dopey Romero hanging in there with me. (man speaking in Russian) - All right. - My treat. - Hey, hey. Sleeping Beauty, come on, get up. (man speaking in Russian) No wonder you live alone. (group chattering) (car door bangs) (car doors clicking) (car doors banging) (camera clicking) - How are you? Very nice suit tonight. (group chattering) (camera clicks) - Who are those guys? - Don't know. But let's stick around and get their plates. - [Joseph] This guy here is one of the heads of the Brooklyn Russian mafia. - Guys, guys. - This guy here. - I've done my share of cases for the year. - He's the senior vice president. - Vice president. - Guys, I don't have time. - Geofuel. - Geofuel, sir! This is huge! - Geofuel. - Right. That's what we've been trying to tell you. - [Peyton] The Geofuel. - [Al] Will you look at the frigging picture. Excuse me, but Mason Buckley, this guy Topolev. Topolev, a ruthless Russian gangster. And this guy tell about him. - That's Joe Lutz. He's the senior vice president of, of trade and supply for Geofuel. - [Al] I'm telling you, sir, this is huge. (bell dings) (dramatic music) (traffic humming) So now we got a prosecutor. That means now we can finally subpoena El Dorado Bank account records. We can track all the phone activity for Topolev's Mars office. Connect the kapusta with Geofuel we had to follow the money. (Joseph whistles) - [Peyton] What? - Wow, look at the dollars. Every single day, we have almost a million dollars in transactions. Money going in, money going out. I mean, we're talking one day, one account, but at the end of every day, the balance is never more than $50. - Money's coming in from Mars gas stations, right? - Right. - [Peyton] But where's it going to? - Uh, I know that. About half's going to PO Box 1213 Central Post Office, Eighth Avenue, New York City. That could be a kapusta connection. Um, the other half. Wait a minute. - What? - Wow, guess where the other half's going to. - [Peyton and Joseph] Geofuel. - That's right. What'd I tell you? - This is great. - What'd I tell you? (upbeat music) (group chattering) - Uh, Mr. Benjamin. - Mr. Benjamin. - Yes, sir. - Mr. Benjamin, over here. - [Peyton] Okay, gentlemen, time for the good guys to make their play. - [Al] Let's go Mets. So Cody decides we should go at both flanks of the conspiracy, the kapusta and Geofuel. We knew that the PO box was the way to find the kapusta. Two days after we started our surveillance, a single envelope was placed in that box. We assume with checks from Mars gas stations. We waited for someone to pick up the envelope. For two weeks we waited and waited, but no one showed. Meanwhile, Cody put together a task force and made a move on Geofuel. He asked to see the two executives who sign the original deal with Misha. - Gentleman, thank you for coming. On this sales agreement between Geofuel and El Dorado Petroleum, whose president is Misha Baruchin. - Uh, Baruchin is the way it's pronounced with huh. - Baruchin. Okay, I see his signature. I see Mr. Buckley's signature. Huh? I see Mr. Lutz's signature. Thank you. Uh, I thought you gentlemen might be able to describe this Misha for us. If your lawyer doesn't mind. - Of course not. Absolutely. We're, we're anxious to help the government any way we can. - Good, good. - You know, I don't really understand exactly what you're getting at with these questions or what possible nefarious involvement you are hinting at. But as my clients have nothing to hide, they're very comfortable indulging this whim. - This is a whim. Yeah, no. - Mr. Kravitz, I assure you that this is not a whim, but your client's cooperation will be appreciated and noted. Can you describe Misha, please? - Of course, he was middle aged. Very distinguished, very impressive. - [Joe] Very well dressed. - [Mason] Came in a beautiful suit. Remember the beautiful suit? - Drove a beautiful car. A Rolls Royce. - Very well presented, very well presented. - Wealthy. - There was really no reason to believe he was anything other than what he purported to. - The president of a company who owned a lot of gas lane stations. - All through the, through the metropolitan area. He was, he was charming and, and well spoken. He was the, he was the very image of a high powered fuel industry executive. - Are you sure? - Of course. - Mr. Cody, obviously my client are sure. So if there are no further questions, why don't we- - I have a question. - Wrap this up. - Well, it's a statement really. Mr. Kravitz, I think it would be in your client's best interest- - Al. - If you explained to this lying rat fuck that perjuring himself. - Al, Al, Al. - The state- - Gentlemen. - The federal law. - Thank you for coming in. - Like five years in prison, okay? - Al, Al, Al. - Five. Five, you wanna do five years? This is your chance to tell the fucking truth. - Gentlemen, I'm sorry, the meetings over. - Your chance. - Thank you. Let me show you out. - Gasoline. Six people have died. Six people have died and you're responsible. And I'm gonna get you and your Brooks Brother suit. So so long, pal! You blew it! - Settle down. - [Al] You believe these guys? - [Peyton] Al, didn't we have a game plan here? - [Al] Yeah, but they were lying. - Al. Al. What the fuck are you doing? - [Al] What? - I wanted them to lie! I wanted them to lie, Al! We put Misha on the witness stand, expose the lie, we win. You could have poisoned the whole case. You may have. - I'm sorry. - Let's look at the big picture. Nobody showed up at the PO box, but we'll continue our surveillance. The Geofuel papers aren't giving back much. No Misha, no kapusta. We still don't have a case. - Well, these phone numbers keep showing up over and over again. I mean- - The Geofuel lawyers will concede that their gas wound up in the wrong hands. - A flower shop owned by- - But their intention will be that they were duped by Russians. - Tuna, tuna company owned by- - No kapusta. - One Sergei Utisov. - We don't have a case. - But for all we know could be somebody's cousin calling for very fresh tuna. - Come on, guys, think. - There's nowhere air in this place. Can somebody open up a window please? - [Joseph] What are you kidding me? It's freezing outside. - We're not getting anywhere with this 'cause of all the paperwork. That's how they get you. They drown you in the paperwork. My neck is killing me. I can't turn my freaking head. Somebody take a gun and shoot me, please. - Al. You don't shut up, I'll take you up on that. What happened to the guy that was so sure we were gonna win this case? - Right. I'm gonna get some coffee. Can I get anybody some coffee? You drop something off a tall building it's gonna crash for sure, but it's gonna bounce one last time before the lights go out. That's kind of the way I felt. No, no, no, no. We will not go gently into that, that night. Or however the fuck that thing goes. - Do not go gentle into that good night. - That's right. - Rage, rage against the dying of the light. - Right. - That's my mother's favorite poem. You read poetry like that? - No, I read graffiti on the bathroom walls. What do you take me for a idiot? Now look, I'll tell you what we're gonna do. We're gonna go to Mars and we're gonna tell this Topolev character in no uncertain terms that we know there's a kapusta. We're even gonna hint that maybe he's the kapusta. - But we don't think he's a kapusta. So why would we, why we bother? - Because the prick will be so shocked we even know that there is a kapusta, the first phone call he makes, once we leave, hopefully he'll be to the cabbage man himself. Check and see if my gun's under the seat. - Well, well, exactly how mad are you gonna make these people, Al? 'Cause- - I'll be my usual charming self. - Now I'm really worried. (traffic humming) (engine backfires) (brooding music) (car door bangs) - How ya doing? Al Benjamin, state tax. I wanna see your boss. (Joseph speaking in Russian) Yeah, right, polica. You know what I'm talking about. Tell him I wanna see him. (knuckles tapping) (guard speaking in Russian) How you doing? What are you guys playing hearts? (door buzzes) (door clicks) He needs that ace. - So what do you want? - I wanna ask you a couple of questions. - I think that you are wasting your time. I, I don't know nothing about nothing. And gentlemen, this is a private property. Do you have a warrant? - No. But I do wanna ask you a couple of questions about a friend of yours. Very special friend. The kapusta. - Why you fucking with my business? What's in it for you? You, you looking for something? - Yeah, yeah. I'm looking for this kapusta guy. If you don't mind. Do you know the kapusta? - The only thing that I know for sure is that in Brighton Beach, a man can have another man killed for $500. - Come on, you're not a tough guy. You're ass kisser, right? You're a nothing. You do what you're told. You have your head so far up this kapusta guy's ass you got shit stains on your socks. - Okay, you'll say what you say, but you're not going to be around for that long. And who's this clown? This your girlfriend. (group laughing) - [Al] Come on. - I'm nobody's girlfriend you little piece of shit. - Come on. - You're going down, man! You made a big mistake. - [Al] Cool it tough guy. Check the time. - Yeah, I. Yeah. I need the first outgoing call after 9:47 AM this morning. Yeah. You're absolutely positive? (phone clicks) - What? - Whoo! Now we're having fun. - What? - [Joseph] Black Sea Tuna. - Black Sea Tuna. (gentle brooding music) - [Joseph] Whoo! - [Al] It worked. Topolev's first call was to Black Sea Tuna. We needed to know about this Black Sea Tuna. And we knew just who to ask. (man singing in Russian) (Andre speaking in Russian) (speaking in Russian) (man singing in Russian) - [Girl] That's it. (woman giggles) - Natalia. (speaks in Russian) Natalia. Natalia. (speaks in Russian) - Wanna say hello? (Nadia speaking in Russian) (man singing in Russian) - Andre. Hey, sorry to track you down like this, but it's important. We went by your house and your wife said you was here so. - This is my private time with my family. - This will only takes 60 seconds, Mr. Rubakov. (man singing in Russian) - Look, tell me what you know about Black Sea Tuna. (man singing in Russian) - [Andre] You are putting me in danger. These people are always watching me, you understand? (man singing in Russian) (ominous music) (girl speaking in Russian) (man speaking in Russian) (man coughing) - [Al] I like you, Andre, but I have to do this. So tell me what you know and I'll leave. - Listen to me, tax man. - Is it a front for the kapusta? - You are a family man, I'm a family man. This time I spent here with my daughters is my time. - [Al] I respect that. - I do not want my family involved with my business. - Well, then stop bullshitting around, all right? Give me a name. You wanna spend time with your family? Give me a fucking name. (Nadia speaking in Russian) I know the kapusta works at Black Sea Tuna. Andre, (blades scraping) just gimme his name. - I won't talk about this right now. Nadia, you remember Mr. Benjamin? - [Nadia] Yes, I remember Mr. Benjamin's as a gentleman. But gentleman do not show up uninvited. - [Al] So uh, how's married by treating you? - [Nadia] Look, this is probably not the best place for all of us to meet for small talk. - [Al] Look, I don't mean to intrude, it's just your father needs to clear up a couple of things. - Down, get down! (group screaming) (guns banging) (gun banging) (Andre groaning) (Natalia screaming) - Natalia! (guns banging) (Andre groaning) (guns banging) (gun banging) (man groans) (gun banging) (gun bangs) - Put the damn gun down! (Nadia speaking in Russian) Stop! (gun clicks) (Natalia screams) Stop! (Joseph screams) (gun bangs) (man groans) (body thuds) (Nadia crying) (siren wailing) (door clicks) (door clicks) (Al panting) - [Cop] He's got a machine gun! (tires screeching) (gun banging) (glass shattering) (gun banging) (cop yelling) (gun banging) Dispatch and out, need backup! Backup quick. Hold your fire. (tires screeching) (siren wailing) (metal clanging) (Al panting) (Al panting) (man panting) (metal clanging) (Al grunting) (metal clanging) (tires screeching) (Al grunts) Drop the gun now, drop the gun now! (Al grunting) (metal clanging) (man grunting) (metal clanging) (tires screeching) (dog barking) - [Cop 2] Drop the gun! - [Al] I'm on the job, I'm on the job! Go that way, he's over the fence! Go around! - [Cop] Gonna need backup. (branches rustling) (dog barking) (man panting) (bodies thud) (man grunts) (gun banging) (Al panting) (man grunts) (Al grunting) Drop your weapon now! (gun banging) - On the ground, do it now! (man grunts) Drop it! Drop it! - Come on man, don't be stupid. - Drop it! (gun banging) (man grunting) (body thuds) (rain pattering) (man singing in Russian) (man singing in Russian) (man singing in Russian) (man singing in Russian) (man singing in Russian) - Fucking arrogance of this motherfucker. (man speaking in Russian) (brooding music) (Abrasha speaking in Russian) (speaking in Russian) (Nadia speaking in Russian) Hey, leave it there. It's already dirty. - I told you don't fuck with another man's business. This is all your fault. - No, no, it's your fault. Let me tell you something, this was a good man. He was a nice man. He was a family man. Now I'm gonna fucking get you. - Okay. - You're a scumbag. - Okay. - I'm gonna fucking get you. By the time this is over, you're either gonna be dead or in jail. - Okay. - You and your kapusta. - No problem. - There was a lot of controversy around Andre's killing. Romero's captain was pressing departmental charges for conducting an unauthorized investigation. My own office was charging me with everything from insubordination to reckless endangerment. The reckless endangerment part, they were right about. I'll never forget the look on Nadia's face as long as I live. Both from Rome and me were officially unwelcome at our respective offices. And we were both gonna be fired within days. Though, Cody had disbanded the task force, we still hung on. We really had no place to go. Look, I know you're mad at me. - I'm not mad. - I got you into this. - You didn't get me into anything. I asked you to take me along, right? - So what are you sulking for? - I'm not sulking. And if I wanna sulk, I'm gonna sulk. And, and it's, and it's, and it's not gonna be any of your business. And, and, and I don't have to ask- - So say it then. - Your permission. - You're mad at me, right? - Look, Al, you're a good investigator. - Thanks. - But you stink as a human being. There you happy? I said talk it. - What are you talking about stink? - No, of course you're not happy 'cause you're fucked. I'm fucked and in 24 hours, we're both gonna be on the street. - Right, right. I, I should be so lucky. Let me just tell you for your information, I gotta stay in the system. I got a mortgage to pay. Dentist bills, my kid goes to ballet classes. They're gonna stick me in a toll booth inspecting stickers for mileage tax. You, you could do anything. (group chattering) I wasn't thinking about losing my big break. That didn't seem to matter anymore. And it dawned on me that I didn't always truly accept responsibility for the consequences of my actions. As much as I tried to fight it, I couldn't escape thinking I was the one who got Andre killed. (suspenseful music) (brooding music) - [Clerk] Next please. - [Al] What's that? - You'll see. See anything yet? - No, just more the same. - What is this? - Well, it's not a potato knish. It's not a blueberry knish. It's not even a jelly donut. But you'll see. Huh? - Nice. $15? What are you crazy? $15 is eight ounces of pate. This is eight ounces of food I can't eat. I'm not paying for this. - Well, I already paid for it. - Oh, okay. - Besides, you know, you taught me about knishes and all and so now- - This, what's this? - I'm gonna teach you about the finer foods. - Look how soft this is. This is bad. - It's brie. - You gotta get your money back for this. - It's supposed to be soft. - Supposed to stink? - Yeah, that's what makes it good. - [Al] Good, then you eat it. Here's another thing I can't eat. So I guess you're officially broke, huh? - Yep. Here. - Thanks. - Salute. - Right. That's good. - Sheer poetry. (Al coughing) (ominous music) What? - There's a guy. - What? - There's a guy. (lock clicking) (lock clicking) (cork pops) - This place is closing in a half an hour. (air hissing) Oh, you missed. - For you I missed. I hit the horse. - No, you didn't. - That's a horse, isn't it? - All right, come on. Watch this then. (air hissing) - [Al] Oh, you got his dick. - [Joseph] I used to be a spitball champion in my lunch room. Okay, watch that. (air hissing) - Wait a minute, wait a minute. (suspenseful music) (man chattering) (woman and man gasps) Yes, we're late for a meeting. (door bangs) - [Man] Tell him I wanna see him as soon as possible. - Mr. Green, please. Could you tell him there's a runner here with a package for him? Well, he has to sign for it personally. Mm-hmm. Morgan, Mandelson, and Chase. Good afternoon. No, I'm sorry, he's in a meeting. Can I take a message? (phone ringing) Morgan, Mandelson, and Chase. Good afternoon. Well, he's in a meeting. Would you like to hold? Oh, you'd like to leave a message, okay. Morgan, Mandelson, and Chase. Good afternoon. Yes, I'll put you right through. - [Kenneth] How you doing? - Morgan, Mandelson, and Chase. Good afternoon. - Thank you very much. - Hey, hey, Al Benjamin, state tax. Can I talk to you for a minute? - NYPD. - Whoa, whoa. Hey, what is this? - Listen, you want me to blurt it out in the open to everybody here or you want some privacy? Makes no difference to me. - Is there some kind of problem? - We don't have one, but you do. - [Secretary] Mr. Green, should I call security? - No, no. Uh, see if the conference room is free. Okay, so what is it I can do for you gentlemen? - Uh, well, you, you can make your life a hell of a lot easier if you answer a couple of questions for me but very, very truthfully. - There's nothing I know that could possibly be of any interest to either of you. - Well, I'm gonna ask you anyway, and if you lie to me, I'm gonna make sure that you spend the next 15 years of your life inside a federal prison for not filing a cash transaction over $10,000. Now the first question is into whose account are these checks going, sir? - [Joseph] Mr. Green, we know that the account belongs to someone at Black Sea Tuna and we know that you are just his business manager. - I'm gonna call my attorney. (phone beeping) - Let me do you a favor and explain the facts of life. If you decide to call your attorney, we can no longer talk to you because you will be a criminal under investigation. - [Al] And it's always better to be a witness than a defendant. - I don't, I can't possibly, I can't. - [Joseph] If you are a witness, you can still save your ass. If you're a defendant, your whole life is over. - Cratchit and Elliot. - Elliot please. - Mr. Green. - I'm sorry. - This is the most important- - On a conference call right now. - Decision you'll ever have to make. - Can I take your message? - This is Kenneth Green, tell him it's important. - Save yourself, man. - Certainly Mr. Green, right away. - Give yourself a second chance. Take care of your family. - This is Elliot. - Elliot. - Think about your family. - Who's this? - It's me. - No, fuck it. - Ken. - Let him talk to his lawyer. - Ken, what's up? - Elliot. - Think about it, man. - What? - Think real hard. - Hey, you there? - [Kenneth] Elliot. - [Elliot] Ken. Ken, what matter? You there, are you okay? - I'll call you back. - Ken. (phone thuds) (phone ringing) (car horn honking) (phone clicks) - Cody. - It's me. We got him. We found the goddamn kapusta. - You kidding? - No, we got him. - This guy Sergei Utisov, one Black Sea Tuna is the kapusta. No doubt. His business manager said, "That Utisov is worth worth $130 million, right?" I mean, there's chicken ranches in Sierra Leon, warehouses in- - Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, I don't care about the warehouses in Germany. Are you sure this is the guy that put together the Geofuel deal? - This is the guy. This is the kapusta. Al's headed over to the guy's factory right now as we speak. - Al knows not to arrest this guy until we get an arrest warrant signed, right? Right? - [Al] Romero called the DMV and pegged Utisov's car, a black '83 Porsche plate number TRO793. So there he was the kapusta, the mystery man himself. I was eyeballing the guy who put the whole scam together and he looked like he was in a hurry to leave town. I figured that when we grabbed his business manager, we hit a trip wire and he knew his cover was blown. (car door bangs) (traffic humming) - Look, I gotta get a warrant right away. There's gotta be one federal judge in the Eastern District working after five o'clock. What about Weinberg? You gotta be kidding me. Uh. (suspenseful music) (door clicks) Judge Dickerson. - What's going on? Did you get a warrant? - What, what about Jacobson? Ah, come on. Let's try judges outside of Brooklyn.

Wow, I could take my kids to Disneyland. I buy myself a nice fancy car. Hell, I could even leave the tax department. It's not even like anybody's gonna care. I mean, nobody's gonna pat me on the back for arresting you or even care that I, that I stuff my pockets. The truth is, uh, truth is people like you piss me off. And you, you have people killed get in your way. (tongue clicks) And I think that I'll feel a lot better knowing that I was the guy that put you in jail.

I'm still a tax man. (man singing in foreign language) And like the good book says everybody hates the tax man. (man laughs) (man singing in foreign language) (man singing in foreign language) (Joseph speaks in Russian) (woman speaking in foreign language) I don't know what the hell you guys are celebrating. Bad guys beat the rap. - Al, we did pretty good all things considered. - Not all things considered. - Come on, not gonna start that. - I'm not gonna start anything. - Al, you're missing the point. It's not about the bad guys. It's about the three of us doing the best we could. You gotta put everything in context. We all have big plans. Not all of them are gonna work out to the fullest. You try to do good, you, you make some mistakes, but you can't spend your life keeping score. - Yeah, but what, what about the guy always said winning is the only thing? (man speaking in foreign language) - Whoever said that must have been one miserable asshole. And I know for a fact that you are not.

Come on. - Who's honor? - Nothing, no dance. - Come on, Al, let's get up there. Al. Come on, let's dance. Let it go.
