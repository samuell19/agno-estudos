Beep Tell me about the incident. Men forcefully break into my house ...when I am alone ...and rape me. I was raped on 16th and 8th …19th, 2nd, 3rd and also 10th. - Which month? - Which month? - January. Did you go to the police? The police refuse to lodge our complaint. They threatened us ...and assaulted my husband and me. These men can do anything ...they can even kill both of us. So there were 4 men? I am very scared, I stay inside all the time. - May I take these applications? - May I take these applications? - Sure. You can collect them later from me. You have my phone number. These will help me to report the dates accurately. We don't trust anyone except you. Khabar Lahariya is our only hope. Sir, I wanted to discuss a case. Which case? Rampal Yadav's, he lives nearby. This case has come here many times. His wife is being raped repeatedly. Why are you refusing to lodge her complaint? He has already come here five times ...he also went on a hunger strike. I am not aware of this case ...and if any officer knew of this ...then a case would definitely have been filed. The previous officer also knew of this case. - I was not posted here then. - I was not posted here then. - That does not matter. I am not pointing a finger at you. But I am shocked your police station has no clue. I believe journalism is the essence of democracy. When citizens demand their rights ...it is us journalists who can take their demands to the Government. This is how one fights for justice in a democracy ...and journalists must use this power responsibly. Otherwise the media will become like any other business. This is going to be our new workflow. We'll also plan trainings ...for reporters new to digital. Are there any questions? I'm feeling scared. Why are you scared? I'm still learning reporting for print ...how will I jump straight to digital? This is the age of technology ...and everyone is adapting to it. The competition in journalism has become so aggressive. There's a mad rush to be first on social media. So we need to shift to digital ...or we'll not survive these changing times. So is the whole team shifting to digital? - But how will we do this? - But how will we do this? - Are you nervous about using phones? Yes, I've never used a mobile phone before. I don't even touch the phone my family uses. I'm scared of damaging it. We need to understand why we're shifting to digital now ...after 14 years of running a newspaper. Because our digital reach will be much higher. We'll also have more sources of income. We have so many years of experience in journalism. Training in digital will give us more confidence ...to excel in this new medium. But the time to shift to digital is now. Were you drawing? Was that homework? Have the clothes been washed? Ironed? They are still wet. Feeling better, Mother? Tell me honestly, did you meet the doctor? What did he say? Where is the carrom board kept? Sweetheart, how would I know? What do I say about Khabar Lahariya? They've managed so far. But I never expected them to achieve anything. So far so good for them. But they won't last for long. When big media companies have had to shut down ...what will they achieve? In our region, a journalist meant you are an upper-caste man. A Dalit woman journalist was unthinkable. Over the last 14 years, we’ve changed this perception. Khabar Lahariya's shift to digital is full of risks. But we have to succeed. When Dalit women succeed ...we can redefine what it means to be powerful. I consider this my personal challenge. Wow! I am so happy! Use this button ...to switch your phone on and off. And hold your phone like this. - Always horizontal, never vertical. - Always horizontal, never vertical. - Why is that? We see things horizontal, so we always shoot horizontally. I'll go slow in this session. Some of you will pick up quickly, some will take time. We'll assess how tense the situation is. Let's first interview the victim's family ...especially the victim's brother. Miners work inside these narrow tunnels ...and the tunnels have no support. So when they collapse, miners get buried alive. Please speak freely, it will help your case. This mine was shut down ...but the mafia was running it illegally. An accident happened ...and a group of miners got buried alive. My brother confronted the mafia about these deaths. So the mafia goons beat him with stones ...and killed him. They continue to run this illegal mine. Our entire village can collapse at any time. - [Meera] Who was the victim to you? - [Meera] Who was the victim to you? - [Woman] My brother-in-law. If we don't withdraw our complaint ...they are threatening to kill our entire family. Who is threatening you? The mining mafia. I am giving you this interview now ...but who knows what will happen to us tonight. Only God knows our fate. This is all I think about. My village used to be very beautiful ...but everyone left after the mine started. There is dust in our food, on our clothes ...so people abandoned our village. I started working in this mine at the age of ten. My job was to collect small stones and take them to the crusher. Do you see the girl in blue and red? She is carrying a basket with stones. I used to be that girl. I used to be very competitive ...making sure my tractor was the first to be filled. I got $0.16 for every round and my target was to earn $2.5 daily. Do you see the stones flying from the blast? Sometimes I feel anxious ...that someone might attack me. Especially when I report on illegal mining. Power is very important. Being a journalist gives me the power to fight for justice ...and that's what I want to be remembered for. I got married when I was 14 years old. But my in-laws supported my desire to study. My elder daughter was born when I was in class 12. My grandmother took care of her when I went to school. The school was as close as this mosque here. Yes, the school was even closer. My classroom used to be on the top floor. When my daughter would start crying ...my granny would shout out: “Meera come back, she is hungry!” Everyone used to make fun of me in school. So when I started working as a journalist ...obviously everyone objected. My husband also objected and tried to stop me from working. ‘When there is a man at home, how can the wife work?’ But working was important for me. I did not want to waste my education ...and we also needed money. Alongside my work, I completed my master’s degree ...in Political Science. And then I completed a degree in teaching. The mine mafia is responsible. Their trucks have damaged our road. - What are you here for? - What are you here for? - I'm reporting on this road. - Which channel? TV or print? - Which channel? TV or print? - Khabar Lahariya. We're a newspaper and a channel. Our channel is on YouTube and the newspaper is available weekly. Stop recording, I want to speak to you first. - First tell me, how did you reach here? - First tell me, how did you reach here? - I walked. - Don't you have a car? - Don't you have a car? - No. Shouldn't you demand a road for cars to run smoothly? No, that's not my demand. Then get out of here. We don't need you here. No one will believe that you came here walking. Media companies give their journalists bikes, mobiles and cash. You have no idea about how we work. You should speak within your limits, don't overdo it. Instead of patronising me, why don't you give me an interview? Our only demand is that you print this story on your front page. - Let me make something clear– - Let me make something clear– - Now you will ask for money. Absolutely not, we don't take bribes to report news ...but you must be used to giving bribes. I don't need a bribe to do my work. If the news is worthy, it will be on our front page. My purpose is not to trouble you. I empathise with you, but you need to speak on camera. She is right. - I'm sure others can speak as well. - I'm sure others can speak as well. - We are scared to talk. The police and mining mafia threaten us. They will arrest us if we complain. I was at home one day ...when a mine owner suddenly walked in. He said I should stop doing these stories. I live in the heart of this mining belt ...and my family worked in these very mines. My work comes at great personal risk. God knows what you are up to all day. - Don't you know what I do? - Don't you know what I do? - Do you ever tell me anything? - But you know where I work. - But you know where I work. - At Khabar Lahariya. - And what is Khabar Lahariya? - And what is Khabar Lahariya? - A newspaper. So you very well know where I work. Yes, a newspaper. What will people think when you talk like this? - ‘Father has no clue what his daughter is up to.' - ‘Father has no clue what his daughter is up to.' - But I– People will gossip about me. Even I don't know how my day will shape up. Should I give you minute by minute updates? - What a guy! - What a guy! - What a guy! This is our usual friendly banter. Now she won't talk to me for a while. Everyone wants to marry an educated girl ...but won't let her work after marriage. So why desire an educated girl? Some families have asked for as much as $7,000 in dowry. What do I say to that? And those I can afford to pay, will not let her work. I was married at seven ...and now I am 60. Am I talking too much? You're like those cranky old men who talk non-stop. Where are the Dalit homes? Dalits live there. The Government claims every home now has a toilet ...and no one goes out in the open. - So what they are saying is– - So what they are saying is– - It is a lie. - Then why do they say so? - Then why do they say so? - So that everyone believes in this lie. But what reason do I have to lie? Look at the condition of my house, look at how I live. We have to take our children to the forest, even at night. - Please keep your shoes on. - Please keep your shoes on. - Your home is so clean, I don't want to dirty it. I had to ask so many people for directions to get here. Why is your home so far outside the main village? They consider us impure and call us untouchables. - Who behaves like this with you? - Who behaves like this with you? - The entire village, who do I single out? If I take anyone's name, they might even kill me. We are somehow surviving. This whole village practices caste discrimination. But I know of only two castes - humans and animals. We've been married for many years. - How many years? - How many years? - Nearly 70 years. And you've never had a toilet in 70 years? Everyone goes out. All my girls have to go in the open. I feel sad. One day during my daughter's class attendance ...her classmate saw her caste in the register. He immediately started mocking her. I tell my daughters, their caste identity will always follow them. This is how our society is structured ...but it is important to keep challenging the system. But it's easier said than done. I carry my caste identity as a weight on my back ...maybe till the last day of my life. Now look at my landlord. He creates problems whenever I work at night. Finding a home has always been difficult for me. People don't want to rent to a woman journalist. And if the neighbourhood is upper-caste ...their first question is about my caste. And when they find out, it's an immediate no. We rave about our country's progress. We're sending people to the moon ...but we remain regressive in so many ways. People were dying of TB in this village. There are no hospitals here. We had reported on this issue. And our reporting created impact. For the first time, villagers saw doctors and medicines. I had reported on this road a month ago. Within a month of us publishing this story ...the administration is fixing the road. This irrigation canal was totally dry. Within 2 months, our story created impact. This canal has water again ...and the farmers are very happy. Within 15 days of Khabar Lahariya's reporting ...we got electricity connections. This happened only because of your news. Let's review last month's performance. Starting with Geeta. She reported 23 stories, all were published online. 23 stories! Now Shivdevi... You've filed 11 stories, well behind the target. You've missed your targets 3 months in a row. You need to be careful now. Next is Shyamkali. - [Shyamkali] I couldn't do anything. - [Shyamkali] I couldn't do anything. - What is confusing you? I don't understand some buttons on my mobile ...and how to send e-mails. I don't understand these buttons in English. Find this. That's the wrong one. 'i' is the stick with a dot on it. But there are so many English characters! Okay, let me do a session on the English alphabet. I'm writing the Hindi pronunciation also. Yes, note everything down. Education is the only way to move forward in life. At the bank, I don't know how to write a form and withdraw my own money. I have to depend on someone else to do this for me. Being educated is very important. This is why I feel very angry when my boys don't study. People always want to know my caste. If they belong to a higher caste, then I tell them I am also one of them. My husband used to taunt me about my work. 'What kind of job needs a woman to be out at night?' 'Who knows what you are up to?' He insulted me a lot but I refused to quit. I told him I will leave him but not my job. Then he started stealing my salary, abusing and beating me ...so I filed a case of domestic violence against him. My heart gives me the courage to carry on. What do you need from me? Another miner has died in a mine blast. His family signed a compromise. Why are victims withdrawing their police complaints? If a complaint is filed, we take action. But why are complaints withdrawn? Who told you that? We always take action. Listen. If anyone is forced to do something against their will ...the police will investigate and take action. Okay then? [Reporter] Sir, I feel such reporting focusses on negatives. This sends a wrong message. We should also focus on your good work ...and show the police in good light. Isn't he an expert on crime? So my questions are about crime. Let me explain something to you. Always pamper an official with praise. Always start with a feel-good question. Not the way you did. Ask him about all the good things he has done. There's enough praise from you all. - But you should have... - But you should have... - Praised him first? You could have edited that out. But I should be praising him, right? Illegal mining is no secret in this region. This is a nexus between the police, administration and mafia. Villagers claim the police have taken no action. The police say they have no data on the deaths ...of people killed in mine accidents. The mafia is becoming stronger ...and nobody dares to speak against them. Will these deaths become forgotten statistics? What will it take for the administration to act? Today I am doing something I have never attempted. I am shooting 'The Kavita Show'. You need to clap like this in front of the camera. Also say ‘sound rolling'. Who will say 'sound rolling'? - Say again? - Say again? - First say camera rolling, then sound rolling. And finally say 'The Kavita Show'… We just did Take 1, this is Take 2. Just say it again. - Should I delete this one? - Should I delete this one? - No no, let's continue. The Chief Minister says he is ensuring justice for all ...but our ground reports continue to send a chill down our spine. Kavita and I are childhood friends. We are lucky to be working together. Look at you. You are always working, even past midnight. Now you tell me something. What would you do in my place? I would focus on housework. - What? - What? - Focus on housework. I don't agree. Why don't you agree? Isn't this also her own work? Isn't her work equally important? - Not as important as running a house. - Not as important as running a house. - This is what runs the house. Send your footage now, it'll be irrelevant tomorrow. This is a good photo, zoom in. - Where are you posting this story? - Where are you posting this story? - On our Facebook and WhatsApp. We need to increase our 'likes'. Look there. If you had captured the reflection, it could have been a beautiful shot. Only the reflection. These are nice shots to insert in your stories. Today you shoot with your camera. Do you have space? I have space, but not enough battery. Everyone seems to have the same problem. - Don't you have a power bank? - Don't you have a power bank? - I have no electricity at home, these gadgets are useless. Let's use all three phones to shoot. You can use my power bank for now. Suneeta, first check if he is available. Is the Minister available? People don't know what his campaign agenda is ...or what kind of development he is promising. Villages in his own constituency have no roads, no electricity. There is absolutely nothing there. Sir, what are your campaign issues in this election? [Minister] Firstly, my previous party only did dirty politics. So I have joined the BJP ...because their focus is development. Prime Minister Modi's goal is development for all. A six year old girl and an 80-year old woman have been raped. What action will you take? When we come to power ...we will ensure rape cases drop to zero. Look at the ruling party ...they say rapes are silly mistakes made by boys. What do you expect from them? It's common to hear one party blame the other. But what should people expect from you? Rape cases will reduce when the BJP comes to power. Sir, one more question. Just ask, let him stand. Ask him what you want to. - You must have something to say on this? - You must have something to say on this? - Wherever the BJP is in power ...women are deeply respected. - But even in cities– - But even in cities– - Rape is a mental health issue ...we all need to work together to control it. Please have some snacks. Suneeta, quickly take a shot of him walking. Are you a journalist or a detective? We came to interview you. Then why shoot my house and my car? We need more shots apart from your interview. What do you mean? When our viewers watch this video on the internet ...they might get bored listening to your monologue. So we need these filler shots. - Did you shoot our banner? - Did you shoot our banner? - Yes, of course. We are shooting you from all angles. We will send you the edited piece. Please show me before putting it online. In case I made any mistake. That is my request. The Congress Party leader's helicopter has just landed. He has made many promises to the people. Election campaigning is in full swing everywhere. Hail Modi! Hail Modi! If a single Hindu life is lost ...we will not go and file a police complaint. But we will ensure that at least ten are killed in retaliation. How am I propagating violence? I want to live in peace. But we need a solution for people who propagate violence. When the law of the land becomes ineffective ...then society must take matters in its hands ...and I believe that time has now come. Would you apply the same logic for Hindu terrorists? I assure you, Hindus can never be terrorists. We have reached heaven! The water is so cold. [Meera] Once every two years, our entire team travels together on a trip. We are exhausted from the non-stop election reporting. So we are here to relax together. 'What are my dreams at Khabar Lahariya?' That's the question. I'm thinking. I used to be very scared of everything ...because I had never stepped out of my village. My work has helped me overcome this fear. Now, I want to become a really good reporter. Next year, I want to become a team leader. I want to master editing ...and become a technically stronger editor. I also want to improve my scripting. My dream is to be a strong reporter and become successful like all of you. Please take my photo. Everyone, please hurry. He is clearly focussing on caste and religion. All this started since the Prime Minister came to power. - Flags everywhere. - Flags everywhere. - What flags? The Hindu orange flags. I have never seen religious processions of such scale ...with huge crowds and loud music. Now that the Chief Minister is also from the same party as the Prime Minister (BJP) ...all this will only increase. The freedom of women will be snatched. You mean whatever women have achieved so far ...will be at risk again? A climate of fear is being created. Where is the real news? Just look at the newspapers. Everything is about religion ...or news that polarises different communities. This is what 'news' has become ...but we have to continue remaining a distinct media outlet. So we have to keep assessing Yogi government's strategies ...and be prepared for the new challenges we will face. We need to have a strategy in place. Our reporting needs to become even more nuanced. If we are simply critical of this Government ...we can be attacked by anyone, at any time. So only a select group of reporters ...will work on such sensitive stories. We need to be vigilant. This is an all-male organisation. And they don't trust the media. If critiqued, they can resort to anything. Your spectacles are reflecting light. You had mentioned that people were not taking Hindu Yuva Vahini seriously. But now I see a very different response. So between then and now, what has changed? Politically speaking, power has tilted in our favour. Our chief has now become the most powerful man in Uttar Pradesh. So obviously we have more power now. And because we have power, our work is more visible. This visibility has led more people to join us, making us stronger. The youth is the future of our country. To me, you represent this future. What is your vision for the youth of our country? How is your organisation taking responsibility for our country's future? My absolute priority is to protect our holy cows. Protecting cows is to protect Hinduism. You always say this. How does protecting a cow benefit people? I will answer this from a religious perspective. In Hinduism, we pray to so many different gods and goddesses. If the youth are made aware that in a single cow ...330 million Hindu gods and goddesses reside. So serving a single cow equals the blessings of 330 million deities. If our youth follow the path of religion ...our nation will automatically prosper. And this is why the Muslims in my village ...pray for my death. So I always carry my sword with me. Can you take it out again? You've been harassing me since yesterday. 'How much is Khabar Lahariya paying you?' 'I can pay you better, but meet me first.' Is this professional behaviour? Keep your offer to yourself, I'm not interested. I'm not interested in arguing with you anymore. Idiot fried my brain. This everyday nuisance started since we went digital. - They killed her. - They killed her. - Who? I don't know, she was killed with an axe. She was alone here. Look at how she struggled. There must have been many men. She was my daughter-in-law. Can I see her face? Is that necessary? I need to see the injuries. - You really want to see? - You really want to see? - Yes. You need more shots? Of the body? The blood has dried, not fresh. - The couple worked here as labourers. - The couple worked here as labourers. - Did they also live here? This house belongs to an upper-caste landlord. My wife's gone. What are you thinking? I can’t make sense of anything. My life just turned upside down. The office is asking for this story right now. But where's the script? - Let's send this as 'breaking news'. - Let's send this as 'breaking news'. - It's too late for that. We need to change the script. - Let's re-use yesterday's murder story script? - Let's re-use yesterday's murder story script? - That's a better idea. Sometimes I feel scared. What kind of life is this? Women face the greatest injustice everywhere. I don't understand this life. Sometimes I feel it's a sin to be born a woman. First, she is made to feel like a burden on her parents ...then she becomes a slave to her husband. Her life is so vulnerable. Did you see all the blood? In my own life ...I am expected to marry a man of my caste, not my choice. I love my freedom. I want a life with no constraints. I might think I am educated, I have a job ...and I should be able to marry a man of my choice. But my choice can shame my family. Should I sacrifice my freedom to protect my family's honour? Someone has commented on your story ...“Good ...progress ...Khabar Lahariya ...and Shyamkali!” Do you feel more confident in your work? Yes I do, but sometimes... I still have some confusion. - Like the last story I did. - Like the last story I did. - Which one? About the tantric priest who practises voodoo. You said my story's angle was wrong. - I don't understand how to decide an 'angle'. - I don't understand how to decide an 'angle'. - In our last monthly meeting ...we discussed about self-styled religious gurus ...and how they exploit people. Some claim their herbs guarantee the birth of a son. They use this pretext to sexually exploit women. This is how you must critically approach a story ...but your approach ended up promoting their work. So that's what an 'angle' means. - I have time before my class starts. - I have time before my class starts. - But I have other work. Can't you spend some time with me? My teacher says all girls must make two plaits. Two plaits are mandatory? What if Mummy has no time for this everyday? Then I get scolded. You get scolded? A senior woman journalist in Bangalore was murdered last week. Yes, it was Gauri Lankesh. We're planning a segment on her murder ...to highlight how risky it has become for women journalists. We'll be doing this as a Facebook Live. Use this as a general shot. Gauri Lankesh was a fearless journalist. Her murder is an attack on independent journalism. These are the dangerous times Khabar Lahariya is working in. She was openly critical of the rise of Hindu nationalism. - Are you making the roof? - Are you making the roof? - I'm building two cow sheds. Since I'm falling short of raw material ...it'll be two sheds instead of the original plan of seven. - Was all of this your agricultural land? - Was all of this your agricultural land? - Yes, all of it. So how will you farm now? I have witnessed the terrible distress of farmers. My father was a farmer and died by suicide. When such things happen to you ...they leave a deep impression on your life. You are also preparing to enter politics. With the Chief Minister as your mentor ...your path should be easier now. Am I wrong? Politics is a process. And I have my goals in place. This cow shelter will be the stepping stone ...to my future political ambitions. And social media is a powerful tool in achieving this. The youth of our country ...are addicted to Facebook and WhatsApp ...and this is how we attract them. Our message is delivered to them. This procession is in honour of Lord Ram. A special request to all the women and girls ...our procession needs you. Hail Lord Ram! Hail Lord Ram! Lack of education, healthcare and employment ...are the issues our youth should be talking about. But we are witnessing something else. The symbolism of the cow is a distraction ...for this Government's corrupt politics. This Government's strategy is clear ...to keep us divided. So that their own failures are never questioned. What are you doing, Mummy? - Checking the videos I shot. - Checking the videos I shot. - Where did you shoot this? The Government is running a campaign ...called 'Clean India Mission'. This campaign promises a toilet for every house in India. What do you make of this? Such badly constructed walls. Did you share your result with your tuition teacher? She said I should have done better. - Their exam marks are low. - Their exam marks are low. - I'm also surprised with their results. They made spelling mistakes ...so I am working on it. But how can they improve? I've always shared with all their teachers ...I don't have time to help with their studies ...so I'm depending on you. And who can support me better than a teacher? Bring a little more energy. Take a deep breath and start again. Why are crimes against women not investigated seriously? Why are arrests not being made? People say that times are changing ...but are they really changing for women? Rape cases are peculiar. It is deeply rooted in the idea of lost honour. We should reconsider whose honour should be at stake. Can you tell me anything about the rape case? The girl is low-caste. Let it be, such things happen here. It's is a private matter of our village. We all have daughters to protect. I'm sure everyone here knows what happened. There are rumours floating around... The clear news is missing. I need information on the rape case. The girl's statement is being recorded. Put your camera down. - What charges have you filed against the rapist? - What charges have you filed against the rapist? - Check with the next office. - But they sent me here. - But they sent me here. - No, ask them. - Has the accused been arrested? - Has the accused been arrested? - Not yet. But I have the case details here. Can I take a photo? Let's see if this has the father's number. Found it! Let me call him. Do you have the police report? Brother... Listen... Is this the first time... I feel your pain. Please don't cry. What has happened can't be changed. Please don't lose heart ...you have a long battle ahead. Have you asked for an investigation? No one is supporting us. I don't know what to do. Please let me speak to your wife or daughter. He threatened to kill me if I told anyone. I'm at the post office, where are you? Can I collect it now? Thank you for keeping it safe with you. I've been invited to Sri Lanka ...to speak at an international conference ...on the trolling of women journalists. I feel so happy to be Khabar Lahariya's first reporter ...to represent the paper internationally. I got my passport! Good morning friends, how are you? I'm so excited to share that I'm in Sri Lanka. I'm staying right next to this beautiful ocean. Let me show you the ocean. Just look at the waves. Can you feel them? Hi Kavita! You're looking lovely! You're not late, we're still cooking. [Kavita] I caught up with all my household chores. - I haven't touched my phone. - I haven't touched my phone. - Everyone wants to report today. I told them to ask meaningful questions. Like, do people even know what Republic Day is? Ask women what freedom means to them. Do they truly feel free in our republic? Tell me something honestly. Why do we call our country 'Mother' India? Why celebrate the country as a mother? There can be many arguments around this deep question. I got very irritated watching the celebrations on TV ...glorifying our democracy. But where is the democracy? Neither are we a democracy, nor are the women free. I want to have this discussion with our team. Hail Mother India! Hail Mother India! If you want India to be celebrated as a global superpower... And if you want the vision ...of a Hindu nation to come true ...then you must vote for Prime Minister Modi. And then nobody will stop you from chanting 'Hail Lord Ram'. We will make sure that Hindus are protected. While we are working as journalists ...we are also fighting to transform our society. But when you don't see that change happen ...then it really troubles me. In our own organisation, we see this irony ...when our best people decide to leave us. Suneeta leaving us is very painful for me. What do I say? At one point, I thought of not getting married at all. Many things were on my mind. So I thought why get married? But I am under a lot of pressure. I need to protect my parents ...because being a single woman is not an option here. People are questioning my family's integrity ...saying they're living off my earnings ...and emotionally torturing them. I don't want to be the cause of my family's suffering. So I realise marriage is inevitable. Things have a way of working out ...and that's what I'm hoping for. I'm finding it difficult to speak any more. Today we're celebrating Lord Ram's birthday. We've come together as one family to express our joy. Will this have an impact on the upcoming national elections? This is our religious festival, nothing to do with politics. Then why are you wearing colours of the ruling political party? We have nothing to do with politics. Can the gentleman wearing the BJP's election symbol come up? Why are you wearing political insignia in a religious festival? God doesn't discriminate between political and non-political. What has God got to do with politics? I have come here to celebrate God. Hail Lord Ram! Flowers are showering on us. Feels like Lord Ram is showering his blessings. Do you have a mic? Our future generations will ask us ...when our country was changing ...and the media was silenced, what were you doing? Khabar Lahariya can confidently say ...we've been holding the powerful to account. We made our journalism the voice of democracy. We didn't let the fourth pillar fall. And we continue to hold a mirror to society. I am Meera Devi, the Bureau Chief of Khabar Lahariya. Welcome to my new political show.
