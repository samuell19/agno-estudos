[NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE] Here it is. Try it on. I moved the buttons. Oh, yeah... Which way did you move them? Only one way to move 'em if you gain weight. [DOOR BELL BUZZES] Better stop having those restaurant lunches with you-know-who. Why don't you call up you-know-who? Tell her. Ready. You better tell you-know-who yourself. You're gonna see her today. I can read memo pads as good as you. Been on all night? I had to go to Atlantic City. -Francisco? - Si,Pop. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] -Did you find Johnny Farro? -He'll be here today. So where do I... -He'll call me. -I'll bring him to you. Good. Be sure to call. [MAN SPEAKING SPANISH] See, he gets mad when you don't. I will. I will. And I also got a lead on a Spanish-speaking guy who can come in and help with Pop... With lots of things. -That's good news. -Buenos dias, senor. Buenos dias, senor. We've only got 20 minutes. You want the siren? No, I want to think. We'll barely make it to the ceremony. You should have worn your uniform. Now, what do you want me to do? Frighten the neighbors. Here's my subway. Uh, Jimmy. I'm sure this guy's okay. He's an experienced male nurse, well-recommended, but run his name through the computer first chance you get. Yes, sir. Do you wanna see Farro tomorrow? Next day? Let's try for tonight, Jimmy. Right. [NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [SQUEALS] [MUFFLED SCREAM] Call the police! OLD WOMAN: Call the police! Hey, stop that! Help me! Help me! [PEOPLE CLAMORING] [SHRIEKS] WOMAN: Let me go! So... I heard Jimmy was working for you all night, huh? Yeah. Just routine, dull. [SCOFFS] Well, how come I don't do some routine, dull stuff and Jimmy do more driving? I like your conversation better. You don't have to protect me like I was your daughter. Funny. My daughter thinks I didn't protect her. Doesn't she have a nice, safe life with a nice, safe husband in Arizona. And that's what she thinks I should have protected her from. DISPATCHER 1: 18-John, respond to pier 92 parking lot... Multiple injuries from gunshot wounds. Three people on the ground. 18-sergeant-10, 85 this location. DISPATCHER 2: Car-18-John responding. That doesn't sound so dull. Wanna go see what it is? What about the swearing-in ceremony? You'll miss it. I'll blame it on my driver. [SIREN WAILING] [POLICE RADIO CHATTERING] Some crazy guy pushed a woman into a van, and shot those people and took off. Why crazy? [SCOFFS] Must've been some jealous boyfriend. Jealous boyfriends kill and run. They usually don't haul live bodies away. And not everybody who kills is crazy. [TELEPHONE RINGS] There goes the phone. I ducked behind that car over there. Can you identify any other witnesses that left the roof? Oh, I don't remember. Now, let's see. We got a white man, maybe 6 feet, clean-shaven, windbreaker, pea cap, and nothing on the guy with him. Well... I just can't remember more. And a light green nobody-knows van. Morning, Chief. These people tried to save a woman. Regular parker up here. One of them tried anyway. The one that got it in the chest. Looks like the other two changed their mind and they got it in the back. Where did you run to? I laid down. [STUTTERS] They forgot me. They just drove straight up. Well, this woman they grabbed... Does she work around here? Parking ticket validated by Ross Investments on 56th. Find out the name of the man who runs this building, and where and when we can see him. Sure. Hurry up. People are gonna want this in tonight's news. Okay, I'm set. Let's grab a shot here. What happened here? Man in charge is right over there. Pancho! Pancho, wait a minute! When do I get to call you "Pancho"? [CAR DOOR CLOSES] Many years from now. First you've got to get to Francis, then Frank, etcetera. I picked this up on the radio. What is it? What you see on the ground here. I've got to beat it downtown, Bradley Oats' swearing-in. I wasn't asked. Stop looking for trouble. It's the Johnny Farro thing, isn't it? I'm looking into it. Stay away from him. If I start smelling bad, you stay away from me, too. You wanna do some good? See if Hadley needs anything. Now, don't be a damn fool, Frank. You should have told me that when we were kids. [CAR ENGINE STARTS] It's too late now. Can you see this story in The Tribune? "Chief of New York City's 3,000 detectives double-parked. "Conscientious young cop writes Nolan a summons." Go ahead. Write it. Every time you guys wanna collar, you just find me. That's because where we find you... They grabbed her. They left everything else behind... Purse, wallet, keys, identification. The lady is all they wanted. Her name's Katherine Miller. Car registration put her in Brooklyn Heights. I sent a man there. Ross Investments said she recently quit. She's a widow and divorced. Forty-four, former husband in Orlando, Florida. She's about 5'5", 140, medium complexion, medium brown hair. This according to Mrs. Amery, Mr. Schuyler Ross's assistant. Schuyler Ross... Why do I know that name? I'm seeing him this afternoon. Want to come with me? No. I'm probably mixing it up with something. Um... What did this Katherine Miller do for this firm? One of the accountants. And left because... Said she had to see her ex in Florida. He's in the hospital with Parkinson's. All right, Frank. Why did two guys grab this woman? She's got something? She knows something? What? Sooner or later, everything happens again. Remember when you were in Brooklyn North? A young bachelor, used to dress neatly, and have a different girlfriend for every weekend. The happiest time of my life. No, it wasn't, Larry. This is. With your lovely wife and family. -Anyway... -Anyway... Prominent lawyer was on trial. The D.A. had a very good witness. The secretary. Only she turned up in Sheepshead Bay without another word to say about anything. She had a funny name. Her name was Rene Dimple. You sure reach back. [CHUCKLES] Do it all the time, more and more as the years go by. I'll check with the D.A. Come to a party at my sister's on Sunday. Can't. Chief would be very mad at me. Why? 'Cause he's mad at you 'cause you quit Brooklyn College. Why should I go there? Because he went there? Then, pick another night school. He won't mind. [SIGHS] I wish he would get off my case. -How did he find out, anyway? -Don't look at me. You know him. He finds out everything. Ah, the hell with him. What about Sunday? Go back to school, and I'll go out with you. FRANK: Hey, Tony. [SIGHS] I'll give you a call one of these Sundays. Maybe, we'll take a run out to the cemetery. What for? Oh, just to look around, put down a few geraniums, say hello to your people, mine, remember things... Promises that were made. Okay? Yeah. Sure, Chief. [CAR ENGINE STARTS] Gee, you're awful, laying guilt on people. SCHUYLER: I really thought she was in Florida, but then we got a call... She had a personal problem. Of course I gave her an appointment. So, Mr. Ross, she was on her way here? Yes, apparently. Mrs. Amery and I have been talking about it all day. There's been no work done in this office. The only problem I can think of her having, and mind you, this is sheer imagination, she did a little accountancy work on the side, or should I say on the outside? [CHUCKLES] But you knew about it. Oh, yes, yes. She'd asked permission. She was privy to a lot of very important information belonging to us. And she very decently promised that none of it would be shopped around. Excellent auditing, verifying, checking. But I have no idea who her other clients were. Frankly, I didn't wish to know. I think there was only one client. How would you know that? Oh, I don't know. I assume. Where would she find the time? [CHUCKLES] Well, whatever she was doing on the outside, somebody killed three people to stop her. Frank. Glad you're here. You, uh... You don't know Bradley Oats, do you? Well, only by reputation. Congratulations. I'm sorry I had to miss your swearing-in. Oh, we're aware of the problem. We've just been talking to the press. There's an afternoon headline calling this... "The Good Samaritan Murders." Three good, decent citizens trying to help killed in cold blood. I wanna stay very close to you on this one, Chief. Well, Captain Larry Jacobs is gonna be in charge of the task force. Oh, he's a good man. Broke that Waldorf jewelry robbery, didn't he? -Couple of years ago? -Yes, he did. But, Frank, could you, uh, leave your office for this one? I mean, take a more personal interest in it. It'd help a lot if we say the Chief of detectives is personally supervising. That parking pier is close to a school, close to a hospital. Makes it even more horrible than it is. We ought to try to look good right from the start. Certainly, sir. I understand your concern. Um... Sir, may I take a moment to discuss this misunderstanding about Chief of Patrol Shannon? What's it got to do with you, Frank? He's not in your command. He's a very old and dear friend. Retirement for Shannon may be in order. We haven't decided yet. But don't expect us to overlook the matter. Associating with a known criminal is intolerable. I'd rather not discuss it without the Chief of Operations present. Tied up in meetings all morning. Who's in there with him now? No. I mean on calls. He's way behind on his calls. He must be using psychic waves. I don't see a single line lit up. Frank, I say what I'm told to say. I follow orders without question. Didn't you ever do that? Sure, twice. Both times I got shot. You bear watching. And you're shameless, Eileen. He's not in there at all. That Sicilian fakers up on Park Avenue pampering himself. Good morning, Vicki. How's business? We sold The Walt Kuene. $60,000. I thought you knew I was saving up for that? Mother is in her office, and I'm called Victoria. Frank, in person. Come on up. Well, this hasn't happened in a while. Oh, what do you mean? We had lunch the day before yesterday. And I think, the day before that. No, no. I mean, you haven't been here in a long time. Well, I had to see someone in the neighborhood and I was early so... Thanks. I was early on purpose. Lovely. We having lunch? Well, Lucy told me to tell you that she thinks, uh... I got to go off restaurant lunches for a while. Really? Why? She thinks they... They use too much salt. Oh. Yeah, yeah. She might be right. But what I want to ask you about was, uh, dinner next week at my house? You, me, my father-in-law, maybe a couple of others. We'll put the leaves back in the table like long ago. A birthday dinner. Yeah. I haven't had one, uh... Not in a long time. Since Consuela's death. That's right. That's right. Her last party, a bunch of her relatives came up from Guadalajara, including Pop, who hated this town and never left, and he's with me still. [CHUCKLES] Come, come. Come on with me. Come on. I have something to show you. And not to take, not for a while, just to look at. Now, this is all Latin American work. They're here for the show. Right? Most of it is recent. And there are two Mexican Studies by Paul Russica. Here they are. That one is for you. And it is Guadalajara. Happy birthday. You're a swell girl. There's no doubt about it. VICTORIA: Mom... Phone. [SIGHS] Be right back. Hello. This is Claire Willis. Oh, Mrs. Amery. Oh... That is... That's wonderful. I'm so pleased. Yeah, it will help the showing so much. Thanks for calling. Oh, and thank Schuyler and tell him, I love him and I hope to see him at the show. Right. Bye-bye. [EXCLAIMS] Who's this Schuyler you love? Hmm. So, make up an owned-by card, put it under the other Russica. Schuyler Ross. He bought that picture next to yours. And he's agreed, as you have, to leave it for the show. Oh... That's it. You must have mentioned that name before. He's a very distinguished gentleman, and one of the gallery's leading patrons. In other words, he's a good customer. Well, I've got to go. The dinner's on though, isn't it? You bet. Uh... You can bring Victoria if she'd care to come. I'll ask her. Maybe you'll get up the nerve to ask her for my hand. Come on. I'm not afraid of her. [GIGGLES] Yeah, it's me. One down and one to go. I got the boyfriend's address out of her. He's down on a loft below Houston Street. Oh, yeah, about the money... There's a change of plans. No... Not my apartment. Yes, your apartment. You're gonna count it out, and I'm gonna watch you do it. And then, you're gonna hand it over in a briefcase. I heard the radio. I didn't know I was buying a massacre. [DOOR OPENS] What are you doing here? FRANK: That's what I ought to ask you. What's the matter? A police surgeon not good enough for your four-star back? You have no business in here. It took me 35 years to get my four stars. And I'm willing to pay Park Avenue prices to keep them. Not that it's any of your business. It took Pat Shannon 30 years to get his two stars. Are you gonna take them away from him? Oh, that's it. Pat Shannon... I don't want to talk about him. -How did you get in here? -Come on, Lou. Drop it. You're aggravating my back. Shannon has kept Manhattan South clean. I've seen him out there in 2:00 and 4:00 o'clock in the morning, doing his own patrol. He takes care of those streets. Oh, sure. The way he took care of 19th street? That's a deliberate misstatement. That's a hell of a way for a police chief to solve a problem, ask help from a guy like Johnny Farro. We're not supposed to talk to these guys. Know them... Much less ask them for favors. Don't make me laugh. Because I can remember things which you might remember... Put them in a book, Pancho. People eat them up. I'm not interested. Francis Lawrence Nolan. Giovanni Amadeo Farro. [SNIGGERS] Long time. Old St. Paul's. I wasn't invited, but in the crowd anyway. I wouldn't miss it. You and your bride running out to the car... All the neighborhood gang yelling and waving. And Pat Shannon and the guys calling you "Pancho," because you just married a Mexican girl. What a beauty she was. God rest her soul. You remember me waving, Francis? I remember, Johnny. Yeah. Ah, the old crowd. There's nothing I wouldn't do for any of them. If they asked. What did you do for Pat Shannon? Just a phone call. A guy named Demetrio, who owns a joint over on 19th street. I told him to keep police officers out of his place. Favor. Friend of mine. Did you tell him the favor was for Shannon? He knew. He knew. Who else could it be for? All the cops were Shannon's guys. I need to know what was said, John. [EXHALES] Demetrio said no, Francis. To me, he said no. Bad language. Very bad. He's not a paisan, you know. He said he didn't care what five grown-up cops did on their off-duty time. They'd come into his place anytime they felt like it. He had a point. Yeah. Well, we tried. Who would figure he'd go fink to the Police Commissioner? Oh, I could. The day after his joint was burnt out... That's not hard to figure, John. [CHUCKLES] Well, like I say, he's not a paisan. Not a gentleman. Guys like that have bad luck. Thanks for your time. Anytime, Francis. Anytime. [CAR ENGINE STARTS] I'm sorry now, Pat called. I guess it was not such a good idea. It was a very dumb idea. But what kills me is it may have been my idea. Nothing wrong with Katherine Victoria Miller. Nothing wrong with her ex in Florida, or anybody she worked with. The computer never heard of any of them. Nothing here. Oh! I've just been speaking to some of the press. I referred to Mrs. Miller as the mystery woman to kind of sell the idea that this isn't going to be solved in a hurry. A wise idea, sir. It may be a while. Question is... Why does someone want to kidnap this very ordinary woman? Where might I find Chief Nolan? Uh, if his secretary doesn't know... He doesn't. Then I wouldn't either, sir. Am I talking to Captain Jacobs? No, madam. This is his office. 'Cause you ain't got a face for a Jacobs. That's true. Tell us more about the roof. What more can I tell you? I certainly wasn't gonna go back to my parking space with all that going on. I drove off that roof fast. I'm glad you called. I suppose I should have called hours ago, but you know you get scared. Well, you've helped us a little with the van, Mrs. Dietz. Sir... Sir, Levy's back from Brooklyn. And Chief Shannon's on line one. Yeah, okay. So, a dent not too big in the driver's door, -and a cracked window. -Yeah. That is just as I said, you know, it had like, a tape running diagonal like you might put there if the window had a crack. You didn't notice the maker's name? Like Chevy van, Econoline, something like that? Who pays attention to trucks? And in a time like that? Sir, Chief Shannon. Yeah. Hello, Pat. Hang on, please. Uh, Mrs. Dietz, thank you very much. Oh, don't mention it. I just hope I'm not gonna be bothered over this. Certainly not by us, Mrs. Dietz. What about by him? The killer? He's shooting the whole world. We'll keep the world away from you, Mrs. Dietz. Pat, listen. I don't want you to say anything, or do anything until I... No, no, no. A whole other thing. I've got a shooting at an old people's shelter. Down near Grand Central Station. I'm in front of it now. It's that place your sister used to work. Oh, mother of God. What is it? Nobody knows. It's no robbery. Just one old man, one old woman, shot. We called in the Crime Scene Unit. Okay, Pat. Talk to you later. Commander Barrow! -Yes, sir. -Yeah. Take a unit over to this address right away. Shelter shooting? Yes, sir. We just got it. I'm on my way. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Yeah? Uh... I won't be able to make it home for dinner. No, I don't... I might be able to look in, just to say hello. How is everything? He took a walk for about an hour. I was worried but he got back okay. Watching television now. Yeah. Okay. Okay, bye. The boss of the parking facility is Samuel Selig. He'll be in the street level office till 6:30. All right. Are you here for the Deputy PC? No. Tell him I vanished into the Bronx. -Somewhere in the Bronx. -What have you got? From the super of the building I hear she has a male friend, middle-aged, partly bald, that's it. She got deliveries from a drug store in Montague which put me on to a doctor in Remsen, who prescribed antibiotics after he took out her gall bladder. And from him and Dr. Nash, I got blood type and general health info. She was fairly healthy. Is she from New York? Larry, was this woman from New York? Does anybody know? She's not. She's from Massachusetts where she went to college, according to her office. Well, who knows her, aside from people who work with her? Get on to that Dr. Nash, and ask him who it was who referred her to him. And I've got this thing over here at Grand Central Station. They're shooting old people. Nuns. This is gonna make the Commissioner's day. The van. Got a dent, possible cracked window, left front. Great. Still green, we're gaining on it. Whatever that doctor tells you, I want to know right away. -Sergeant. -Uh... Yes, ma'am. They told me Chief Shannon was here. He just left. May I help you, Sister? FRANK: Mary Elizabeth! Francis. What are you doing here? I thought you were way the hell in... Where is it? Indonesia. I was chased out for being a Marxist. You were chased? What did you do now? I kept asking the Government for medicine and food. They insisted on giving Marx all the credit. So I'm back here in our little old Hilton for the homeless. Why didn't you call me up? -I just got back. -Move on. Now, listen... What happened here today happened before. I mean, before I left for the mysterious East. Three or four months ago? Almost five months ago. Let's go up. A young fellow came sprinting through the downstairs sitting room, he had a gun and he shot an old woman in the side. "He shot her?" What do you mean? He killed her? No, she lived, but she's still in Bellevue. I never heard about any of this. What the hell is going on? FRANK: What's the matter with you? Why didn't you tell me about this thing the first time it happened? Don't give me that big brother peremptory tone of voice. You were in Tempe visiting Angela. Detectives came around, seem to be doing all that could be done. Theresa, where's Mikaela? In the kitchen, Sister. I'll get her. Then I left the country. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry I'm a clod. I didn't even take the time to say a decent "hello." We always were an odd bunch. -Were we? -Very. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Here's Mikaela, she got a good look at the fellow. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Okay, okay, okay. Senorita,okay. [BOTH SPEAKING SPANISH] No, 30, no. Less. 25. Uh... He had a jeans and an army coat. I never saw the gun. I saw him run through, just a look. I heard this woman screaming. I hear Mr. Delamos screaming. He shot her in the leg. Here, here... And he shot him in the neck. Here! This fellow's a lulu. What has he got against this place? What has he got against old people? Well, who've we got that knows about people like this? Captain Shore's got the inside in all that. Huh? A little book of memories spoken by you, recorded forever by me. It says right here... "Captain Mike Shore knows everything about birdie brains." Oh. Well, then that's the man I want. Who's the boss here, Captain Grant? And Lieutenant Mulcahey. I want Captain Harry Grant, Lieutenant James Mulcahey to take themselves off duty tomorrow. Wait for me at my office beginning at 9:00 a.m. Do you know these guys? We all say, "Hello." We play softball in the park on Sundays. Mulcahey's on the Captain's list. And that's not the only list he's on. Now make the call. ROSA: Yes, sir. Ladies, you wanna come with me. [SPEAKING SPANISH] With all the room I've got up in my house, do you have to sleep in this mansion? Phone call, Chief. -Detective Levy. -Yeah. Yeah. Now, wait... Wait a minute. Let me get this down. Uh, who're you giving me? This is the name of the patient that referred Mrs. Miller to that doctor? All right. All right, yeah, I've got it. Ah, at times I wonder what the hell I'm doing. I'm not seeing life, I'm just everything that ruins life and ends life. Maybe I ought to take Pop, move to Arizona. Will you take us all with you to Arizona? You take me downtown. [CAR ENGINE STARTS] You off? Yep. You? Yep. -You came to see me? -Yep. So what's going on? I go back to tech assistance here for a few days. Hey, you ought to try and transfer over there. You're good at electronics and stuff. How about a transfer out of the whole deal? What "whole deal"? Like, out of the force. Well, if that's what you want, out. I never wanted in. It was my father and my uncle and their old pal Pancho Nolan. Jeez. Talk about police brass. If the force ever had a godfather, it's him. He puts his hand on your shoulder and that's it, your life ain't your own no more. Look at this college thing. He made me go. He said it was what my family wanted, for me to be an inspector like my father, and more! Chief! He'd back you in anything if it was good. I want to buy a bar up on Pleasant Avenue. What's wrong with that, huh? He said, "No way." He even said he'd shut down the joint. I'm not hearing the whole story, I'm sure. You know what he said to Bobby Kelly from that 119th, Queens? He ran into him on a date one night at the Garden fights. He called him aside, he goes, "Don't go out with that married broad no more." He never said "broad." What difference does it make what he said? Does that make sense in this day and age? He told you and me, we ought to go out together. That made sense. What about Bobby Kelly? Stop fighting on my stoop! Hey, lady, give us two minutes, huh? No. I'm gonna call the cops. No record of follow-ups. No investigation at all. It could have been but nothing was punched in uptown. All we have is Lieutenant Mulcahey responding to a complaint last December. That's it. He's got an excellent record. Harry Grant, too. What happened? [TELEPHONE RINGS] Chief Nolan. Yeah, right here. Captain Jacobs. Yes, Larry. Yeah, wait. Wait a minute. She... She worked where? Oh, he doesn't know. Interesting man, this Schuyler Ross. Listen go home and get some rest. Be fresh tomorrow. Yeah. Me, too. Straight home. Love to Essie. Good night. Barry, go home. Type up those notes in the morning. Yes, sir. Hilda, go home. Yes, sir. Jimmy, we've got things to do. Hi. Hi, Laurie. It's Chief Nolan, Mr. Selig. Hey, I wanna thank you for waiting for us. Just to save time, would you get out your employee file on the guard who was on duty this morning. His name is Whitman? Yeah. Right. Well, we're on our way now. Yeah, bye. [SIGHS] Whitman. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Didn't I write that name down somewhere before? Yeah, Whitman. Whitman's the name of the friend who referred Katherine Miller to that doctor in Brooklyn. Well, I suppose there are lots of Whitmans. This Whitman is George W., for Walter, been working here exactly three months. Oh, well, I've got just George here. Anyway, he must have been familiar with all kinds of vehicles but he says he can't identify that van. He's just scared to death. How'd you hire him? Agency, or what? I don't recall, really. Now, Mr. Selig, there's a George Whitman, he's from Brooklyn, he's sandy-haired, light complexion. Like your Whitman. A friend of Mrs. Miller's. -Could he be your Whitman? -Could happen. I was wondering was whether Mrs. Miller might have recommended him for this job. Maybe we ought to talk to my assistant, you know, in the morning. He does some hiring. I also have a note here that Mrs. Miller besides working for that Ross company did some accountancy on her own. Would you, by chance, have been a customer? Are you gonna start investigating me? Did you hire two men to abduct her? What? What a thing to say. That's terrible. That... What do I look like, a hoodlum here? I run a business. Sit down, Mr. Selig. No references. Just a name and an address. Which I note here is no longer Brooklyn. Will you make a note of that, Jimmy? Why no references? I just hired the man, as you say, as a favor to Mrs. Miller. Oh, as a favor to Mrs. Miller. Why? She do some favors for you? No, no, no. Nothing like that. She'd just helped with some paperwork. Strictly business. Her friend George needed any kind of a job. He's an accountant himself. But I gather, he had some kind of a legal problem. I don't know what. Okay. Chief! I had nothing to do with what happened here. Oh, I wouldn't think so. I'll stop by again, Mr. Selig. HILDA: George Walter Whitman, aka Walter Whitteman. DOB 2/7/29. Boston School of Business, B.A. Convicted fraud, Providence, 1970. Indicted fraud, extortion, Brooklyn, New York, 1979. Extortion. Acquitted. Indicted, extortion, Brooklyn, New York, 1980. Two extortions. Present address 640 Joralemon, Brooklyn, New York. Uh, here's something for that machine of yours. Mr. Whitman is no longer in Brooklyn. Now our new address, this side of the river, 422 Crosby Street. [CLATTERING] [GLASS BREAKING] JIMMY: Look at these guys. That van has a taped window and a dent in the front. Try and cut it off. My error, Jimmy. Get on that radio. Car four to Central. Car four to Central. Just hit by a van wanted in homicide. Location Crosby Street. South of Houston Street. Oh... Let's see who he's got here. Katherine Miller, of course. And let's see who else he's got. That's overkill. This is Schuyler Ross's office number. Okay. Well, Ross's home address and telephone number. I haven't got that myself. Let's try it out. Just for fun. [TELEPHONE RINGS] 6241. Well, Mr. Ross is actually on his way out. Who? Uh... One moment, please. A Mr. George Whitman, sir. Say that I've just... No. Who is this? This is George Whitman, Mr. Ross. I said, who is this? This is George. I got your telephone number from Katherine Miller. I'm a little worried about her. I... I hope she turns up okay. Katherine and I were working on something together. [LINE DISCONNECTS] He's not taking calls right now, Captain. So hold on. I'll go in. I'll ask. Captain Mike Shore, you want to take the call? Uh, no, just ask him if he'll meet me at the tavern in the park at 1:00. Well, this Whitman knew Millers in Fairfield, Connecticut. It's crossed out. There's a note. Deceased 10/79 or 10/81. Her parents? He knew Miller anyway... Five years. Oh, way more. Here's a scratch out. Kathy. Campus, lower McFadden Hall, 2102. And the phone there, was an exchange, L-O. That's before they went to numbers. This goes back. There's a bill here from that Dr. Nash. Oh, let me see this. Oh, yeah, $1,200 past due.1984. Well, he needed money. Well, the story might be... They're friends from business college. They meet later. She's married, but so what? Romance. She tells him some interesting things about Schuyler Ross' operation. He talks her into doing his old thing. Extortion. -And Ross kills both of them. -Sir... Lucy called from home. Your father-in-law went out for lunch by himself, and she's a little worried. It's been two hours. She called the Argentine place and the Cuban place. Well, he also likes that Thai place. Tell her not to worry. He'll be okay. Did you check on that male companion nurse? There's a memo on your desk, sir. All okay. Oh, Detective Levy, line two for you. Captain Grant and Lieutenant Mulcahey. Oh, yeah, right. Uh, Jimmy, will you give me five minutes with these guys? Yes, sir. "Regarding an irrational shooting incident." Who wrote that? I put that in, sir. In assembling the notes. Well, all right. Let's call it that. Bring them in. Sit down. This irrational shooting incident at the Holy Saints shelter... It was reported by Patrolman Gary Brown and Lieutenant Mulcahey. He sent detectives Swann and Demarco. -That's correct, sir. -Yeah. And their paperwork on the case. Who saw it? I don't know, sir. The reports on file. You never saw it? Never reached my desk, Chief. Or your ears either I take it. Don't you recall any of your men ever mentioning it? I really don't. The two detectives were put on other cases. Who was put on this one? Sir, it was a very busy week. I was trying to clean up some things before I started my vacation. What things? Sir, if you'd like me to I'll dig 'em up, I will. -You can't help him? -Sorry, sir. Didn't you think I was gonna ask any of these questions? Ballistics told me this morning that the man used a .22 caliber revolver. He didn't kill anybody. I suppose you could call it aggravated assault dangerous weapon, which is something that goes on all over this city all the time. All right, all right. Let's cut this short, gentlemen. A nut started shooting at people nearly five months ago. Up to yesterday he seriously wounded four people. Yesterday, the department started to investigate. That's inexcusable. I'm flopping you both back to uniform. That's all. That van lost them, Chief. Maybe it got over the Williamsburg bridge at the Manhattan. Maybe it got stashed around Soho for tonight. They can't figure it. Deputy commissioner Oats, is on the phone. I told him you stepped down the hall. Tell him I left the building. Unless he's snooping around the building, is he? He's not, sir. He's lunching with someone at 21. Oh... That wouldn't be my father-in-law, would it? They're all different, Chief. How different? See, I had a fellow in his 20s. He liked to frighten old people. Now, he wouldn't touch them. He'd just yell and holler until they'd beg him to stop. Now, he may graduate to be a shooter. In the meanwhile and in between time, that rascal has pleaded guilty on a simple assault, and he's free on probation. Chief, I had a young woman that liked to beat old men over the head with her pocketbook. Yeah, but, Mike, what do these birdie-brains want? Oh... They want to do damage. Not sure they want to kill. They kill without intention. It's like your guy, Chief. He uses a little .22. Now, why doesn't he use something bigger? I'm telling you... Two of my babies were armed with much deadlier weapons than they used. And when they were being arrested, they did try to use them. I am putting you in charge of this task force. I want you to tell the boys all you know about the way these nuts operate. And you stay close to me. 'Cause this is a bad case. Very bad for the department. PAT: Mike? Long time, Mike. How've you been? Fine, Chief. You look well. This is how the ladies describe him and how our artists see him. You have a crazy person up in Grand Central? I don't know. I've been thinking about you, Norman. And I've been thinking about you. You see, how I have one of these folders sticking out a little bit? Just in case you should come by. [CHUCKLING] So, uh, what have you been thinking about me? I was telling a friend something you told me 26 years ago. Everything happens again. Ah, merely a paraphrase from Shakespeare. "Life is, um... "a twice-told tale." Oh, I, uh, I mentioned Grand Central Station because of incidents that, uh, have occurred in the vicinity of stations in Ohio, Pennsylvania. People being shot and wounded. Nobody knows by whom. Old people? Only old people. Four of them. There, see for yourself. What are these words? Geraphobia, geracide, geriaphobe. They're new words. Neologisms of mine. They're for, uh, hatred of the old. I showed them to an FBI acquaintance of mine. But, uh, when he couldn't find them in the dictionary, he, um... He lost interest in them. [CHUCKLING] Norman, would you photocopy this stuff for me? With joyful anticipation. Looks like our guy has found himself a nest somewhere, for the moment. Yeah, we got a patrol going through every building where somebody can hole up. Good. Take a minute and look at those clippings, will ya? Where are your gloves? I don't need them. I don't like them to tell you the truth. Okay. I see Rosa's not with you. That's right. She's working on TV monitoring equipment tonight. Learning. Moving ahead. Know what I mean? She likes what she's doing. Not everybody does. Know what I mean? Sir. Do I tell you what to do with your life? Not lately. If you want to quit, quit. But quit for something better. Quit because you're ambitious. Not I hope just to show me who's boss. Now that's stupid. I said I'll call... [SIGHS] The minute... I said you'll be the first to know. Now say something nice. What am I? Just another news source? Like the headwaiter at the St. Regis? No, I'm just wondering if you like me for myself or for the horrible work I do. Larry. Call from Queegs, line three. All right. I'll talk to you later. I got to go. No, I do think you're spoiled but very lovable. Bye. Captain Jacobs here. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don, get on this with me. Now listen. No, no. Don't try to pick the guy up. Let him lead you to where they've got the woman. Wait a minute. We don't know she's dead. I want to see the place before we go in. I don't want to set up a hostage situation. Just tail him. That's all. We're on our way out there now. See you. What was that? LARRY: The van. Out near Rockaway. Here's a telephone number where I can be reached. Now, don't let anybody kill those bums. They may be the ones who can make our case against Schuyler Ross. What your guess on Katherine Miller? Oh, I think she's dead. I think they killed her the minute she told them where Whitman was. What did you find out from the D.A.? Never heard of Katherine Miller or Schuyler Ross. If you're looking for your main interest, he's over on 42nd street, figuring out ways to burn me up. Don't be like that. You know he feels about you as if you were his father. Well, I'm not his father. And you tell him if he wants to keep on fighting his father, he'll have to go out and fight in the cemetery. I'm just a man in a profession. I'll do the best I can to bring others professionals up the grades. For the profession. It's part of the job. You have a way of making it seem like a personal thing. Wrong. I keep personal and professional matters strictly separate. And you repeat that wherever you think it'll do the most good. What's the matter with your mouth? What? Wind chap. I told you what to buy for wind chap. [TELEPHONE BUZZING] You wanna look like a prize fighter? Here. Yeah. You're sorry, darling, for being so pushy? Well, I'm sorry, darling. You've got the wrong darling. I suppose you wouldn't know what that call for Jacobs is all about? I didn't hear anything. Captain Shore is waiting downtown, Chief. Okay. And like you, anything personal I happen to hear, I don't mix up with professional. Let's go. Those clippings from your friend got me thinking. Maybe this guy works or worked for the railroads. I got about six who'd fit the profile. Age, height, weight, general appearance. But there's two that I really like. Are they railroad guys? Yes, sir. Pennsy and Long Island. Quit or fired in the last five years. Wilmer, James H. Date of birth, Hartford, Connecticut, 1955. U.S. Army, Infantry, 1973-1975. He knows guns. Yeah. Wait a minute. -Would an army guy use a .22? -It's as I told you. Our guy would use a smaller weapon on his victims, but he could use anything up to a mortar to defend himself. Kill that one. Show us Mr. Boone. Boone, Arnold. Date of birth, Chicago, 1956. U.S. Marine Corps, 1975-1981. Two hitches in the Marines. Railroad track worker, 1981, Kansas City. Fired, assault on supervisor. Forged honorable discharge from Marine Corps. Inquiry disclosed, discharge was dishonorable. Well, I like Boone. I'll call you later. Dashing to a cocktail party. You really ought to arrange for me to buy that other Russica. It was naughty of you not to tell me that there was a pair. Do you know what you're doing Schuyler? You're confessing to a terrible thing. Somebody confessing something? Yes, he is. Frank Nolan, this is Schuyler Ross. -How do you do? -How do you do? And he is confessing to a complete lack of sentiment. But, my dear, I'm the most sentimental man in the world. He covets my gift to you, even though he knows what it's all about. You can't have it, Schuyler. Anyway, I want you to buy that Impiglia over there. -Mmm... -A big, expensive one. Hi, Marge. Excuse me. I want to show you why I was so interested -in the one you've got. -Oh. -I'll be right with you. -Jimmy... Stand by that phone up there. We may get a call from the beach. Excuse me. Come in, Don. I want to know where are you now? We're just out of sight, about 150 yards away. No, no lights, no nothing. Don't worry. We won't blow it. Just remember. Watch out for yourself. One guy went in with a van. But the other guy could be in there, too. The one with the orange roof. Well, I spent over a month of my life in that very villa with a dear friend of mine, now departed. Oh, well, then I can understand. Claire's told me about your personal interest in Guadalajara. Well, my painting is Guadalajara, too. Would you consider a trade? I wouldn't feel right about it, Mr. Ross. I don't know why. Then I'll say no more about it. Did you meet your late wife on a visit down there? No. Here, at the UN. Her father was a member of the Mexican Mission, and she worked for him. And I was sort of in and out of there for a while. Schuyler. Marge Mills says her husband will be here later. Here's a chance to meet him. Well, he better make it in the next 20 minutes or so... I've got a very important appointment at my place at 8:00 o'clock and I can't be late. Oh, there's Niles Carr. Excuse me, Mr. Nolan. Niles! Were you being unfriendly? No. I'm never unfriendly. I was just... Reasonably negative. [SNIGGERS] [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] Stand still and be quiet. Put the bucket down. Slowly. Hands over your head. Slowly turn around. [MEN TALKING INDISTINCTLY] MAN 1: Grab that rope... -All right, pull it up quickly. -Here she goes. Okay. MAN 2: Ooh... This baby's been in there a while. [TALKING INDISTINCTLY] MAN 1: Let's get over here. What's Katherine Miller supposed to look like? Wet. Yeah. Emergency guys thinks she's two days wet. That would be Katherine, all right. You got off a couple of rounds. At what? Just a couple of rats out there in the weeds. Slugs that killed the people on the roof came from a 9 millimeter. That would be your pal's, I guess. Or maybe you killed Katherine Miller with this one? Where's the body? Look I told you, I don't know any Katherine Miller. Let's get back to your social calendar. The 12th. Wally's auto body, Hempstead. "Come at 9:00." What for, Mr. Brice? The van you painted here day before yesterday, 16th. What did you go to Wally for on the 12th? Stolen plates? 'Cause they were registered to a party in Hempstead. Well, we'll look up Wally. What's this? 18th. And today? "P1-7E66-8." Did you write this? Maybe this isn't your book at all. Maybe it's your friend's. What's his name? Stack. Mr. Philip O' Stack. What's Mr. Brice's first name again? Mr. Brice's first name is Leland. You don't mind if use this line, do you, Leland? As much as it isn't yours anyway? It's true of course what you say. Very different people can be happy together. My mother was teaching Art when she married my father who was making buttons and zippers. [PHONE RINGING] But they had interests in common. That's the main thing. Well, you make a pretty good case. Phone, Chief. Excuse me. We're in. We've got one. Leland Brice. Well known to the computer. Everything from assault to robbery to murder two. In and out of the joint. Attica six months ago. We're going over everything here, waiting for the other guy to show up. Stack. Also big in the computer. -There's more. -What? I found something in his diary. -Was that for today? -Yeah, the 18th. P1-7E668. It's not a phone number. It could be a serial number, or a license number maybe. Well, I'd... Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hang on. I've got something... Down here. P1-7E668. Now wait a minute. P1... What about Penthouse 1, 7 East 66th, at 8:00 p.m.? Huh? Would you buy that if I told that Schuyler Ross... is on his way out of here this minute to keep an appointment at 8:00? Leland, you've always been a bad boy, but this... This is very bad. How did you and Stack come to meet Mr. Schuyler Ross of East 66th Street? Well, how did the people describe him? The way he looks in the drawing, Chief. We got the main area covered. We're gonna start working the tunnels. Has Chief Shannon been around? Oh, sure, he's been here twice today, checking on his patrols. He's back here right now in street clothes. Okay, fine. There's a guy in a cab. Okay, Mike. I got to go now. [CAR DOOR CLOSES] Where do you take a break? Uh, the staff has a room down the stairs. Well, go take a break. Now. No, Chief's not here. Oh, well, um... Just ask him to call me when he comes in, all right? Anytime. Just... Either here or at my apartment. Fine. He just flew out of here without a word, so I was just wondering if... Well, I don't know what I was wondering. Leave the bag on the floor. Back out slowly. Put your hands on the roof of the cab. And don't do anything but that. Tom... If that call from the coast doesn't come in by 10:00, you're free to leave. Well, well. Was this $25,000 for Mrs. Miller or Mr. Whitman or both? A policeman. The suspicion crossed my mind when we met. Would you believe that? My guess is Whitman. And my guess is you're a confused man. But I just arrested Stack, so who and how much were you going to pay to knock off the third party? Mr. Nolan, are you here to arrest me for something? If you are, then I have to cancel my date for the theater. If you are not, you'll have to excuse me, while I dress. Because you know, I'm sure, another man was working with Miller and Whitman, and that man's in bad shape. He's scared to death of you, Mr. Ross. On the other hand he's scared of me, too. I've explained to him, of course, that if he cooperates with me, he won't have to worry about either one of us. And he's thinking that over. Do detectives have to undergo regular psychological testing, Mr. Nolan? Well, if we make a couple of bad mistakes, inquiries are certainly made, yes. And that's why to answer your earlier question, I'm not going to arrest you tonight. First I have to find out exactly what you were doing, what these people had against you, and why you had them killed. And then I can make a case. I'm sorry to detain you, but I think you still have plenty of time for the theater. So now we have Katherine Miller's body. And the sledgehammer in the van killed Whitman. And blood doesn't lie. And if it wasn't you guys running out of Whitman's place, who was it? Abbott and Costello? We're trying to be straight with you, Brice. Didn't I read you your rights? Didn't I tell you to call your lawyer? You ain't even got a lawyer. Chief, medical examiner's here. I'll bet you Schuyler Ross has got a lawyer. Sure. Those guys get the best. The woman we got in the morgue is not Katherine Miller, Chief. Wait a minute. You mean, the woman in the canal last night? The woman they pulled out, she died about the same time, and she's got no bodily injuries. And the blood we found in the van is a different type anyhow. Her age? Way under 40. And she never had a gall bladder operation or any other operation. And pregnant, in the second trimester. Could be a suicide. Herb, I need a vacation. [CHUCKLES] Oh, hey, I'm going to St. Croix in two weeks. Break away. Come with me. Great place for a change, Chief. Every man needs a change. Let me think about it, Herb. I'll think about it. Woman in the canal wasn't Mrs. Miller. No kidding, who was she? Time will tell. It's another case. And when we said, we have Miller's body, our friend in there said nothing. I think I'll go back and punch his face. Don't touch him. Don't touch him. We got to break him, Chief. We can't offer him no deals, and they know it. Easy, easy, easy. Keep everything kosher. You want to give him pain? Walk away from him. Let him think. You're keeping in very close touch with the media. Anything wrong with that? I can't come into your home, and see Essie and the kids, and play some game... Make believe you're still the same guy. Nothing wrong that I know of. Afternoon, Chief Shannon. Mrs. Mackleton. [SIGHS] Well, Frank. I'm here. You wanted to see me? You never told me that this guy, Demitrio refused to cooperate. [SIGHS] Well... Because it turned out so bad, Johnny went nuts. It looked to the commission like Demitrio said no, so you and Johnny burnt him out. That's ridiculous. Johnny went nuts, not me. I know. This guy... Selling cocaine, girls, green cards, stolen cars, regular... Supermarket. And he has the chutzpah to run down to the commission, and they make a panic case against me. I don't blame the PC as much as I do Maldonato. He knows how things really are. But what worries him, is how things look. Oh, he's in step with the world, my friend. Now, this is what I've got to do. Roll over. You won't get your third star this year. I won't keep the two I've got already. I'm out. They called me in this morning, and they want my papers, end of the week. [MUSIC PLAYING OVER BOOM BOX] [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMING] You mentioned me to Ross? I got a big reaction. Ross doesn't even know me. Well, he got the impression somehow that you might know a lot about him. Couldn't you lock him up? No, I didn't have a real case. No, I wouldn't be afraid of Ross himself, but he does pay people to do things that he would never do himself. You know what I think? That you ought to do is take a vacation. A month. Somebody said St. Croix was nice. I don't know all the details. Ross set up a company called Mexol. Petroleum and sulphur products in Mexico. Funneled clients' money into it, but it didn't really exist. Katherine caught on. She offered to cut me in on what she got out of Ross if I gave her money to help Whitman. And all you could do was give Whitman a job. -Yes. -For the same cut. Listen. Nothing ever came of it. Five killings. I mean, all I did come right down to it was give a guy a job. Can't we possibly look at it that way? Possibly we can. I want to tell you, what we can do for each other, Mr. Selig. I don't want to hear about what went on in days gone by. How we winked an eye at what people did. I said people winked an eye at what we did. Did you make a practice of consorting with known criminals? We knew a few, we still do. Uh, Commissioner, the use of informants with criminal background was and is a common practice, but here, we have a two-star Borough Chief... Thirty years in the department. Who was not seeking information. He requested a recognized crime boss to act in his behalf, because he said Demitrio's dump might have been raided, police officers might have been caught in the raid, Shannon might be called to account. I think he was right. But faced with the same problem, police officers frequenting a place like Demitrio's, other chiefs wouldn't have chosen Shannon's solution. And what happened to Demitrio? Besides getting burnt out, nothing. He was never convicted of any of the activities ascribed to him. The law was obliged. I'm not talking about the department, the law was obliged to consider him an ordinary businessman. Sure, like Johnny Farro, who never spent a day in jail in his life. I think we're wasting our time. So do I. Gentlemen, Chief Shannon came to me, he said, "I can't control these men, "but I must control them. "I've got to get help." I approved. I'm not his boss, but I am the senior officer. The blame is mine. You surely didn't tell him to do what he did. Not quite. He said he was going to see Farro, you said, "Good idea?" Is that it? Not exactly. I said, "Maybe it's a good idea." Commissioner, I've been doing this job a long time. Mostly by the rules of the department. Now and then, by my own rules. It's all up for judgment. The bad choices along with the good. I stand by it all. If the department can't take it as it is, then I can't take it. I'll leave it. I could have stopped Shannon. I didn't. You don't want his papers, you want mine. What are you giving us? An either or? We keep Shannon or you step out? That's it. I don't think honor requires that, Chief, or friendship, either. When do you want my papers, Sir? I'll leave that to the Chief of Operations. I'll leave it to you. You'll have my papers the day Shannon hands in his. [SIREN BLARING] -Any word? -He killed the old man. Chief, the old fellow at your sister's, on the edge. We got a fix on our guy, Chief. He's not in the main station. We've swept it. All the track areas are covered. The gates, the public and employee doors on Lexington and Vanderbilt are covered. He's down on the tracks. He's in these tunnels. But what about exits leading from those tunnels? We got three possibles. Two up on park, and the elevator at the Post Office coming up from the tunnel. [POLICE SIREN BLARING] Captain Jacobs on the phone, Chief. Yeah. Selig from the parking pier just arrived. You coming back here? No. Just make him comfortable there. Explain to him how we're going to set this thing up. Tell him we're going to have him covered at all times. Tell him, he'll be in no danger. Call me back if there's any problem. Need anything, Chief? Yeah. Give me a flashlight. Post three, come in. Reynolds, come in. This is Captain Shore. Reynolds or Williams, post three. Come in, post three. Post three? What's the matter? Where are they? They're at the Post Office. Oh, no. I goofed. I sent Reynolds and Williams over to 41st street exit. FRANK: Tony, grab that car. Get yourself organized. I checked that post myself Where the hell is it? It's at the west end of the post-dispatch dock. All right. Get in the car. Rosa, stand by that phone. We may get a call from Jacobs. Yes, sir. [SIREN BLARING] I want to find those tunnels that lead off the tracks. This way. All right, you come show me. MAN: Here it is. Turn your hat around. Take your shield off. That's no .22. Hold that light away from your body. Tony, get on the radio to Captain Shore. Tell him we've got him here. See if he knows some way around behind. Tony! Captain Shore's on his way over. I sent our emergency guys. We got one man down. One of the two that were with the Chief. [DOOR CLOSES] [SIREN WAILING] Where's Tony? Rosa. I don't know what to say. What is it? A grave? PAT: Lime pit. Calcium oxide. Found some 50-pound bags of it in the wood chest. These guys had a going business here. Then we found this and started looking for holes. The bags were there with the remains. How much is left of her? Her? We couldn't tell it was a "her" in here. Do you mean Katherine Miller? She's over here. Want to take a look? Nah. SELIG: Thanks for coming, Mr. Ross. My apartment would have been more comfortable. I feel more secure here. What did you think I might do to you? Can we talk business? [SIGHS] Talk. The police are trying to scare me about the murders upstairs and wherever. I'll risk that if it's worth the risk. SCHUYLER: What are the police talking about? SELIG: George and Katherine had all your lists. Confidential addresses and so on. They'll try to find whoever put you in touch with the killers. That'll give them a lead to you. What good are you to me? It'll be hard to pin a murder on you unless you had strong reasons to do it. I can tell them about those "strong reasons." What do you want? What Katherine and George wanted, plus my cut. You're asking for a million-and-a-half dollars. And at this point in time, I don't think it's excessive. What about a quarter share of Mexol? What would it be worth? $250,000 now... Against 250,000 annually. We've got what we need. Leave the tape running. Finished? They're setting the next meeting. Tell Levy to join me. Levy, Captain Jacobs wants you to join him. Levy? LEVY: I'm on my way. Put your hands over your head. Move slowly forward. Frank. Oh, Claire. Claire, thanks. Thanks for coming. Frank. Hi, Claire. I want to say, I thought about the other day. It's a problem. There's a cure. I'm working on it. PRIEST: Family and friends will of course remember in very personal ways the special glance, the manner of saying things, the moments of seriousness and fun. But the world remembers a man by what he has done and considers whether it was worthy. Did it help? Did we benefit? Are we less well off now without it? Shall we remember? It is a fortunate man whose line of work in itself answers yes to those questions. This young man's chosen profession proclaimed a personal merit. He was drawn to the service of his community. He went with enthusiasm, with love, with devotion, wholly of his own choice, even to the sacrifice of his very being. He has assured himself a glory, which we here cannot imagine, but which we will see one day, God willing, for our Lord has said to us, "I am the resurrection and the life." -A word, please. -Certainly. Oh, yes. This might not be the right place but it's police business and it's urgent. Nobody around here is going to object. I want to know, what you'd consider as a good deal? -Deal? What deal? -For Pat Shannon. For instance, we take away one star. What do you mean? He's out, isn't he? We don't want you out. The Commissioner doesn't want it. I don't want it. Let's do something that looks right. [SIGHS] All right. All right. You want to tell him or should I? You. I've got to set it up. I'll see you downtown. Chief. See you at work tomorrow? Okay. I think we all ought to stop by the Corvello's. Lucy told me can bring home anybody you want. She shopped. We can put the leaves on the table. Yeah. We can do that. The old time way. Yeah. Let's all do that. Well, it's work tomorrow for both of us. Of course, you won't get your third star this year. You'll never catch me now.
