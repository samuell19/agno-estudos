Ready Doctor, shall I start? My name is Anand Kumar. My age is 28 I’m a children’s film maker. I like films a lot I like my life more than the films Somehow, I’d many friends in childhood, till 10th class, Degree and I think even till my Masters I mean, I think only one or two were real friends Rest of us all used to just go around and that’s all Like we say young and stupid Later, all friends were scattered I think I’m not a great extrovert Saying so, I’m not even an introvert I had at least one or two to share that time But to share now, actually there’s none Yeah, we got diverted from the topic we started That first kiss! First Kiss! Of course, not for me - Then for whom? For that girl Srilakshmi! You look bit a happy today? No, I’m very much frustrated What’s wrong? The same! I saw what I daily see once again and got more disturbed - How? I was going home jogging and a car stopped A girl got the window down, showed 100 rupees not to a kid and asked him to get vegetables from the opposite shop Ok, why to be disturbed for that? That kid brought within a minute But she made that kid into her servant within these 10 sec. How egoistic is she? Though rich, do they look at all like slaves? Huh! That kid was in need of money and brought them. She didn’t stop with that She started scolding that kid as an onion fell down Onion rates have gone up, right? So, won’t people not behave well with each other? The discriminations are going high in the society day by day Remembering all such thoughts, losing confidence again on the society, anger further increasing on humans.... Oh, nope! We shouldn’t search so deep in a small matter, Subba Rao. Anand! We shouldn’t search so deep in a small matter, Anand That girl has ego and that boy had a need. That’s all and you shouldn’t link this to society, you and your Aadhaar card Why do you say to search for meaning in an item song, man? For suppose, what’ll you do if a girl as such comes into your life? First, I don’t need such a personality and two, on such love, marriage and children... You say don’t have any belief in all such, but you like girls, right? Someone like you said a guy with no lust can’t get a salvation I understood A lady entertains becoming the tide A lady gives you joy being the body She sculpts a human becoming a tool She sculpts a human becoming a tool A lady is precious either in the skies or the earth A lady is immeasurable treasure Hey, look... cotton candy. -Is it for sale...? Why are you throwing all these packets into cars and autos at the signal? My boss hits me if I don’t sell all these, bro Ok, you get ready and I’ll go - Ok Who is your boss and what’s his name? I’ll talk to him - No bro Here... Hey wait, come here - What bro? Here, take this Brother. Why do you waste your life like this? No brother, Babu is into dubbing inside - Who, dude?

I mean the love story in YouTube, short film. What was that dude? That is Love Gulab Jamoon, born in love... You know... I died in love Hey... - Huh - Please don’t mind him But seriously, you could’ve done much better. You’re a Mass Communications student, right? So, what didn’t you like? The love scenes or the comedy scenes? I mean the making, the overall film making and I’ll talk about that more detailed in our work shop. Bye Come on Lakshmi dear, we shall eat - Coming dad Come dear, dad is hungry. Come on dear - Yes, I’m coming Have this from dad. Yes, just one. Lovely! Excuse me! Hi Sir - Hi The film, Children of Sunset is very good. - Thank you, did you see? Yes, I saw - Nice! Where did you see? I saw it in Devi Theater - Good theater, actually sound is great there.

Sir, Sir, sorry Sir I couldn’t find anywhere Sir. I searched YouTube and torrents You saw in piracy? Should I complain in Cyber Police station? Where did you see and who else watched with you?

Do you have 100 rupees? Hey, I forgot the wallet yesterday in your house -Not in the house but in the bedroom Hey, push that light a bit up. A bit down, ok! Ok, ok... I’m fine (Item Song plying in background...) What’s running? - Item song I didn’t ask about the song but what is this item song for Pochampalli Sari Ad? Sari maybe Pochampalli but should walk on that ramp, right? Still what about you? Status? Rough cut of those BBC old movies is on, will you watch? Come on Anand, still the rough cut? Hey, not just this one alone but should spend some time even on my children's project And don’t worry, I’ll finish Before the deadline Anand! That children's one is your personal project. Why not do some good spicy film? Huh, if we go on doing such, company should be shut down Spicy film? You produced, right? That 2012, Heavenly paradise, Evils Mountain 2005, and so on? It was again me who gave that dubbing because I wanted to save even that dubbing artist’s 15000 As per my calculations, if we do such small projects, we can never do a 100 Crores project brah. Block buster film statistics as per this Forbes Magazine, if we work hard for 4 years it fetches 2000 crores brah. Hey you say uncle, dude, brother in law and even bro is fine, but what is this bra? Easy brah, easy We too worked hard three years to do Children of Sunset, right? Ok fine, don’t worry. Yeah! Mr. Numbers, we shall do next year. But you know, just let me do this one thing and then we shall do your commercial film. But, I asked to try funding for my children’s project. None of you are trying at all. Brah, none is coming forward to fund your children's project including NRIs All are asking about returns and it is very hard out there brah. This isn’t looking good, we seriously need some money brah. Yes Anand We must keep moving, we must keep going. If you can’t fly, run. If you can’t run, walk. If you can’t walk, crawl. But all means keep moving This is a great visual. This is a great inspiration I know, it’s a great character I know Say if you have a character inspiration you know as such. Mahatma Gandhi, Sir - Ok Mother Theresa Sir - Good Powerstar Pawan Kalyan, Sir. Hasini Who is Hasini? Genelia from Bommarillu film Ok, how? Hasini is beautiful, she says good jokes, likes father and loves Siddarth. Like this See, Gandhi for one and Hasini for you Say if there’s any other character that inspired you Jessi from YMCV - What’s YMCV?

She’d someday really get us married Children of the Sunset? Is it an English movie? No, it’s our Telugu film. He named it as world cinema He, is he your boyfriend?

No, all these days I don’t know what you are. A film with a heart, how did you do it? Even my family members liked it very much. Very good film Thank you, so finally you watched it. Sorry, I spoke all rubbish in the class saying Hasini and Jessi Doubts need to be asked, that's how we learn. That’s how you learn new things No... No... - I too learn the same way I really liked it and it’s a very nice film Did you just kiss me? Where are you going? - I’ll just come Krishna kissed Radha 24 times in Brindavan romance The first time when Romeo and Juliet met, they kissed 24 times in 24 hours. Lovers in Greenland kiss 24 times in front of Akna (Goddess of fertility). for their love to become eternal So, there is a divine significance for these 24 kisses Added to it, 24 is a number, 24 times and 24 kisses Really? - Yes What’s happening here? - 24 Madam 24, what are 24? As written in that book, when they kiss for 24 times, they become a couple, right madam? Kiss of love is a just fictional novel. Even Ramayan and Mahabharat are fiction, right madam? There is a historical evidence for Rama and Krishna There are evidences for kissing before Akna Goddess in Green lands till date, right madam? Who won arguing with you, say?

Ok, you know where these tigers, lions and cats do... I mean the cat family, where do they smell? Ok, the foxes Ok, what about the dogs around us? Do you at least know why they smell? So, this smell is the most powerful sense, even more than the touch So, this means that you are powerfully, physically attracted a lot to this girl She’d have understood She’d have read in the internet by now It’s good. After a long time you are meeting a new girl Do you see future with this girl? - No, no I mean, I’m not sure now. Let me see if this goes till there There’s something about that girl... She’s something and that’s all It may not go till that extent Special feelings towards a girl for the first time and that’s a good sign. Ok, but when was your first kiss? First kiss!

Because it's class You listen even to the old songs? I saw also. I need Robert McKee book. You said about multi dimensions. from that book and I’ve a few doubts Hey, what are you doing? Multi dimensions. The first throws of love. That very first kiss There’s tightness in my belly and it feels so real, will I resist? Cause our souls are dancing... Yes our souls are dancing. Oh our souls are dancing. As our fingers entwine Cause our souls are dancing And I feel like romancing. Yes our souls are dancing As our hearts come alive There’s something in your smile There’s something in your way And it makes me want to know you just a little bit more Is it wrong to stay? Cause our souls are dancing And I feel like romancing Yes our souls are dancing I can see it in your smile. Yes our souls are dancing. Yes our souls are dancing. As our hearts come alive... Yes our souls are dancing. And I feel like romancing Yes our souls are dancing. As our hearts come alive... Cause our souls are dancing. Yes our souls are dancing I can see it in your smile Sri... Is this what is multi dimensions? Hey, book. I’ll be waiting downstairs. Pushed me against the wall Who is this Robert McKee? Robert McKee, you can take him as father of story Father! How often do you visit home? You speak on the phone? It’s been 5 months since I went. Mom is crazy about TV serials. Sister dresses up nicely everyday and stands at the wall outside. Grandpa smokes pot behind the temple wall. Pot..? There’s something between your family members and the wall. Yes, I too didn’t notice till now. That’s why you also kissed her against the wall Nothing as such, but... That pressure... that pressure when pushed against the wall so You can feel more of her body, more time and more intimate. So, you don’t say anything to family. Not so much. Even if you don’t say anything to family, you shouldn’t hide anything from your partner, right? To be partners and gain trust, so some truths needs to be told without hiding them. You need to take that risk in a relationship and there is no way out. Why get in troubles by telling the truth? Oh, so, it already happened before. Ok, who’s she? Have you been to Lonavala? It’s a perfect place for a vacation. It is very cold but very nice. Wine is a superb combination for the weather. We can go in three hours from here. We’ve brought everything, right? We may forget anything but not wine. How many bottles? Ok, you’re asking for so many times and how many times have you been there? Many times. Huh, girls? Yeah Who? Friends, colleagues, you know... Had sex? Yeah, I think maybe once Hey, what are you doing? It just so happened and that is... I didn’t plan it. She was just a good friend, that’s all If that girl is a good friend, what am I? Good friend...? What do you think about that incident now? I told the truth and she misunderstood. So, you started hiding things from people. No, no... I tried to be honest and told truth. She went further away From then, I stopped saying things about one girl to another. But, I never cheated anyone So, you say there’s no mistake of yours. Then, why didn’t you tell to this girl? All may not be like that girl, right? This girl may not understand these things. It’s difficult for her age But at some point, you are going to tell the truth? If she knows, you fear losing her? Hi, I’m going to Goa to attend Goa media content bazaar. Would you like to join? Me, what shall I say at home? Film making! Actually... I see... Good company and good moments. - Oh, really? They didn’t say anything at home? Nothing, they should know to say something, right? You didn’t inform? I think you should call your dad. I think, I should... Hello. Hello dad, I am going to Goa with friends. Then, why are you saying now? I came without informing you and I don't feel good about it. Ok, take care - Thank you dad. Tension house Brandy, in every peg tension... Hey, don’t blabber too much Hello... Ticket... Is it good? Journey Journey 2.3 crores kids in our country are mal-nutritious. You know, you know how much is 2.3 crores? I’m talking about just basic food a child needs per day, one egg a day. It’s just about, getting that child to eat one proper meal a day. Anything to do about funding, please come forward I hope you understand the cause. Thank you so much. I wish your friendship should stay along with me So, you guys... There is no better way to get your concept correct. Let’s be together So, what happens in crowd funding is you go to a crowd, where you don’t know the people through a platform, where you reach out to them and ask for money. How do you do that? You have to create an impression in the minds of people that you are the guy who can implement this idea No idea how I’ve come without informing? Ok! Story means... Now you inform your dad, he blesses you and there isn’t any drama in that... There should be a drama in a story Class? You asked to say about film making, right? Will you drink? I never drank I mean, tried beer once when friends forced. Cheers Your presentation was very good Thank you. I think none other than you liked it. Do you like kids? Why not try crowd funding? I just attended and it was very interesting. Yes, I know So, why don’t you try? Huh, I don’t know... See... I have no confidence to get funding on kid’s problems No, I’ll support you. I’ve so many friends if needed and we can create a buzz online. Looking at your presentation, they’d definitely like that. People will come forward to fund your project. Yes our souls are dancing. And I feel like romancing. Yes our souls are dancing. As our hearts come alive Cause our souls are dancing. My heart at this moment, surrounded you like Lava My separation like that Sky surrounded you as a falling net. At the time when a blossom and a fragrance console me like you. At a time when a joy and an excitement are burning in us. Ferocious form of the desire and the burning light of love. The romance is on swing and its love making. This moment is so sweet and this war is sweeter Bodies getting along are a fragrance of being one This celebration in equal halves for you and me is a boon. To meet you within you, hope is stood on the tip of toes. Breathe longed for so long to be tight into your hug. Thirst in me drunk honey from you like a dragon fly Let’s change the heart beat getting our lips together Let’s forget this world getting our bodies together. This moment is so sweet and this war is sweeter Bodies getting along are a fragrance of being one This celebration in equal halves for you and me is a boon. How do I explain all the passion in my heart? Something will be left behind even if I say in any language. This uniting of us should fill the scarcity of words You are the dazzling fire flower and I’m the flowing breeze Song of the united dreams is the blossom. This moment is so sweet and this war is sweeter Bodies getting along are a fragrance of being one This celebration in equal halves for you and me I think I’m in love. But somehow, I’m frightened Padmavathi and all others are saying to be careful with film people. We got to start and can talk all these matters even in train, ok? With someone else like this, before... If I have done, will you stamp me as a bad person? No! Tell me straight. I like you I continued so as you too like me. I don’t know, but I like you Not physically, but I really like you. That means, you are... -What do you know about me? In this age, you feel this attraction as love. Look Sri, I like this. what’s we have now is good. We both like each other. I like you and you? How would I come to Goa without liking? So, where’s the problem? 12, right? How do you know? 11 and 12, seat numbers... Ticket... Don’t mistake me as I’m asking like this Don’t you feel, you cheating her by escaping with false answers ? What? No, I’m not such guy. Srilakshmi is a very good girl, innocent and romantic. I like her a lot. And everything happened with her agreement. We did so with both of our consent. Then if you say her truth, she’d stay if she likes or look her way if not. It’s like cheating till you say, right? I’ll say it myself at right time. I have no problem as long as she’s Srilakshmi. It’s a problem if she becomes a lover or girlfriend It becomes normal. There won’t be any respect given to each other. Roaming, scolding and getting separated Relationships are like this, right? So, instead to be like normal couple, I feel it’s better to be like this Maybe you’re wrong, right? One look is enough for few to fall in love. A smile is enough for some. and a remembrance is enough for some more. So, maybe there’s a truth in her feelings, right? Try to say the truth this time Come on, sit. Padmavathi is coming, dad Why, did you stop coming with me? Come on sit. I pampered you as I named you after my mom. You should be little careful at this age. I gave some freedom like a modern father. I made you pursue whatever studies you wished for When you said Mass communications and movies, I said yes. Don’t misuse that freedom Ok dad. Yes, marry any guy you like. But inform and marry. Don’t elope and marry All these Arya Samaj, Dravida Samaj, Mahila Samaj... Ok? Sorry dad... I love you dad. I’d never go anywhere without informing you. What else madam, are you doing the short movie? Yes. Why not give me a chance, as a writer My foot! I write good madam, you know about my punch dialogues right? You said, you want to say me some truths? If I say the truth, you may get upset Try it. I feel uncomfortable her. Like a College student? Uncomfortable like a thief - Police are coming, be careful. When you keep rolling these six twists with your four fingers... Can you show me once? What, here? Hey, just once Hey, not like that Uncle is coming. Hey, please go. Please - Bye Does that guy also love you? Yes dad Know that first dear. First you check with him and tell me. Go dear. I really want to know. I bet you won’t get a straight answer. Look Sri... Are you in love or not? I love the feel of loving other person. But the love you’re saying... that’s a commitment One on one, a relation and a bonding... Should we name every relation? Are you in love or not? Sri, that is... - Yes or no? Sri, I’m not ready for relationship. Maybe it’s a bit too early. I already told you. What your dad said is correct. Not just the straight answer, but I haven’t got any answer at all Because I was never in love I don’t know. Sri... Sri... Hey... Hey, coffee is falling It’s been so many days since we met. What’s wrong? I’m not comfortable. I’m really sorry. Won’t you call? I’ve exams Ok, bye. Ok! Ok! Hey man, have you gone blind. You don’t want love but you want romance? Who wouldn’t want Mr. Murthy? I mean that isn’t the point, right? That is the point. She doesn’t! Girls aren’t so, at least when they’re in love But we, we men are dogs. We have the senses of a dog. True, but I’m not someone to swing my tail for that. So, you need sex in your terms I want freedom Yes, the name we’ve given freedom! Yes, all the humans need it. A man is a freedom lover. - Is it? I heard he is a hope lover. Maybe human changed. Ok, did you told the truth to her? I felt like running behind her and say sorry. I felt like request her to understand me. Then why didn’t you go? As I didn’t want to force her... Look Anand, maybe you’ve love towards her What you’re feeling now maybe love, right? Being from a dysfunctional family, maybe you’re unable to express your love. Maybe you are unable to experience that Maybe because of the distance between you and your family, you’re unable to get closer emotionally to anyone See, what I’m trying to tell you is... Look Murthy, we can’t analyze someone’s life with psychiatric terms and methods. I’ve no confidence on this therapy. Then why are you coming here? I can’t put out my pain to the wall, right? - Ok, what else is happening in life? What happened today and how are you feeling? In general, I could stay back in room for few days without coming out. But somehow, I couldn’t be alone today. I miss my loneliness. I’ve been looking at all the contacts in phone Family, friends, Sri... Sri isn’t lifting my calls. I don't know what to do. I’m repeatedly looking at her number Wow! You are the only guy who likes the loneliness. No problem even if you miss it. This family, friends, Sri... You’re mixing Sri, right? That’s a good sign Serve her food first Hey, how if you show your anger on someone over that plate? That’s the plate gifted to my mom Your mom cooked bitter guard with jaggery, eat it I don’t need any bitter guard Why do plead her, hubby? - You serve. What, what’s happening here? What exactly is happening here? What is happening here? Pooja and Rajasekhar are in love. No! Pooja loved and Rajasekhar was loved. Pooja thought he’s the one she loved and he would marry. But Rajasekhar didn’t think so. He created an earth quake in the beautifully started life He said ok for love and no for marriage. Never want to be married, will Rajasekhar understand the Pooja's true love? Will he understand? Will he? It’s not that the bitter guard is good but this lady finger is over ripened. Stop that anchoring and have the food, come on. What? Youth sensation! Naughty cousin, the romantic Goddess! What’s all this? There’d be film information in that brother. Hey, read books I mean the literature. What are those books brother? Sri Sri, Gurram Jashua, Vemana or at least Chandamama stories. Ok? Friends? Oh, you mean friends with benefits Hey, stop! Tell me what’s it? Please - Ok, ok. No benefits and just friends, ok? No, not ok. Teacher and student, ok As you said to be the mentor for my final project, ok? Okay. Some relationship, Teacher and student... Film making, cinema! Cinema! A French writer named Marriott in a film said... Dear... Cutie! Forgive my bravery and ask your beauty. Without any chance for any fight, give me back the kiss I had given you. I want to get into a peace agreement with you Believe me with full heart. I don’t like at all to give you a pain. Don’t mind for kissing you. The gift of tender age can be given by the kiss, right? If you still don’t want it, give back the kiss you’ve taken from me Hey, I didn’t say it, French writer Marriott said it. First time in life, I pleaded a girl. Good. Why did you plead? I don’t know I missed the good moments being with her. I felt nothing wrong to plead for those good moments. So, you like this girl. Then Viswa and that Mumbai girl! Yes! They are just friends. But I like spending time with Sri very much. Why would a person be liked by another person? There’d be many reasons. - For which reason are you liking? I don’t know, but... That feel, when I’m with her... Yes, you said Those moments... Once again, identify yourself. My name is Anand Kumar, age 28 and I’m a children’s film maker. What happened? We don't have a session today, right? I know. It’s urgent, it’s really urgent. Please... So, what happened? The earth has broken up - What? Why children? Why Children’s projects? Because they are our future... Listen, I’m the Finances head here. I can talk about finances but not about emotions or the nation. Ok, let’s talk about finances then. Nothing to talk, when we invested 2 Crores in your last children’s project, just the interests counted up to 60 Lakhs Not even that 60 Lakhs interest is recovered till date Brah... Let me show you some real numbers. Brah, see these numbers as per my calculations How many ever papers you tear down, this is what I’d say. Brah... You know what? We shall do films on animals. I feel pity seeing them. They are so cute, no? We shall do. We shall do on everything other than a human. You know what? Let’s hire more models and do more item songs Sure, why not? 60 Lakhs kids are suffering from malnutrition and that too kid below 5 years of age. 9 out of 10 are dying. Yes! We’re ranking number 1 in the world. Yes, we’re on top. When kids are drinking water from the drainage, tears aren’t rolling down from eyes but from heart I’m going breathless One says animals... Other says calculations and some others say money We have more degrees, but less sense. More knowledge but less judgment! More experts but fewer solutions! Though we have all these computers, missiles and machines, human is still walking in the wrong path. Big desires but very small values! Among all these... I am talking like a mad guy. You know what? I’m done. Hey Malathi Here, we go How if we fight amongst ourselves? Who are we? When we individually say as my project, where are we? Brah, not that but listen to me Hey. Go and work in ladies boutique and you can even write accounts there. This brah, nonsense. Anand get up. Come on get up Hey Sri! All these days, did you had sex with any girl other than me? Why? Why? Why is everyone asking the same question? What is the relation between Sex and love or for that matter Sex and friendship? Yes or no You just have all yes or no questions? Are you a question paper? - Yes or no? Yes. That’s it. We’re done Done! Done! Done for good I don’t know whether I’ve a maturity and all that nonsense But I have the right feelings, I have the right emotions. I’m a right person with the right emotions. Please use your mind a bit Have I ever lied to you? You always tell the truth You won’t cheat. But I... I’m getting cheated like a mad girl Here... Counting every kiss, buying a rose for every kiss, looking after that rose daily with love and care Sri... No. I never want to see your face again. From which kiss should I start? Which remembrance should I think of? Yes, first short film! When you said short film wasn’t good, I felt like you said I wasn’t good. Somehow, I looked for more time in mirror. I have the habit of looking into the mirror from childhood. First time, I hoped if that mirror is you. Attending class makes me this happy. I used to stare at your lips when you are teaching the class and I felt like touch those the lips at least for once. And those lips touched me for 23 times. That first kiss, in my life and that bodily excitement, how do I say? From which kiss shall I start? Which remembrance should I think of? Yes, bodily excitement! Cold in the back, palm! I can feel that bodily excitement. I can feel it even after going back home. I can smell that memory. That moment, that particular smell! Kiss on the neck means uninhibited you There are so many meanings in Google, but all are good and even in Telugu. What is uninhibited means... I came to know after coming to your house. When being with a person as a right, when would we get that right? That’s only when we have the love When you pushed me against the wall, I saw that love in your eyes From which kiss shall I start? Which remembrance should I think of? I don’t know whether 24-myth is true or not But that love in every kiss from you, feeling that as love, wishing for that love again and again... From which kiss shall I start? Which remembrance should I think of? Even when you said I’ve no maturity and not to know what love is, I searched for that love in you again and again. I searched in your looks and I searched in your presence I searched in every kiss you gave. I know one thing. When you love the children and world so much, how much more can you love Srilakshmi? I understood that I can’t be without you Even if you feel that you can’t be without me, that is our love I know that my love will become true. And that my 24th kiss will become true. And that my “you” are true This is the first epic without alphabets. This is the lovely meaning of thoughts with no language. This is the holy sound being the life of the first lives. Heart explained with the lips. Sweet feeling experienced with the touch. It’s true, beautiful and eternal. A kiss is a divine touch This is the first epic without alphabets. The bonding is as strong The feelings are as valuable The symbol to announce that This is a dedication to love. Heart explained with the lips Sweet feeling experienced with the touch. It’s true, beautiful and eternal A kiss is a divine touch. This is the first epic without alphabets Our session isn’t there today, right? - I know. It’s urgent, it’s really urgent. Please... What happened? First time in my life, I’m in love. I feel it. That’s great. That’s next. But first tell, with whom it happened and when? This morning Srilakshmi came to our office She came and She said 23 kisses, 24 roses. 23! You said 5 or 10. Still she said friends with no benefits and what are these kisses again? So much has happened in these two weeks, Murthy. I want to talk. I want to say a lot. Not one session per week but let’s have a session per day One per day, oh no! Let’s think about that, but where were we last time? You said no benefits? No benefits, just kisses She suddenly came and kissed me. One may even understand the oneness, but not a lady, Subbarao. SVR said this What happened after that? Drizzling day of monsoon... The evening I and Srilakshmi met Climate was romantic and, the world disappeared When a rain drop passing the lips of Srilakshmi. She kissed it all of a sudden. Looking at the slipping rain drop and thinking the luck is mine. I too kissed that drop immediately. Hey, bullshit! It’s all bullshit. When you kiss a rain drop, how’ll that be like kissing the girl? The girl kissed that raindrop and I kissed that same raindrop. It’s clear cut and it’s a perfect kiss. Huh! It isn’t touching and is all like artificial Okay next... next. There were just 10 passengers in the bus which is from Ameerpet to Lakdikapool. She sat window side beside me The bus was dashing in a great speed. Then there was a sudden break Oh no, it gave me a big shock. Another kiss happened for me with Srilakshmi while just watching. This is a kiss and it should be like this. What happened then? Next... I was asleep one afternoon getting lazy I forgot to tell, even Srilakshmi was with me I Startle and woke up and saw Srilakshmi... She was bent over me and was adjusting the pillow. What had to happen, happened over the heart... Oh my goodness! Did you kiss even there? Gods woke you up at the correct time. Not any Gods, but cat threw something down in the kitchen Even the animals are favoring you Gods must be crazy! Srilakshmi was playing with me hiding my favorite photo and by teasing me. I too was behind her stubbornly Moving around hall and bedroom, she came into kitchen She climbed on my shoulder from above. She gave me a smooch bending forward This is the twist. I thought shoulder kiss is on the shoulder. Did she climb over the shoulder and kiss? What did she climb next? Golconda. What? Ok go on I and she, in the loneliness without anybody around us... On the peaks of Golconda and I was on the tops of that happiness. I took over her lips taking the sky as witness Someone may see... Those in the sky can see us and we see those on the earth, but they can’t see us. Why is that? The sky kiss Sky kiss? So, all are done on the earth? What is this Subba Rao? Ok, go on... Next The tiny ant! Even that loved Srilakshmi. It went into her sweater and was giving her a tension. Srilakshmi madam was into jumping I went into that sweater like a brave warrior I caught hold of the ant, took it out but I stayed back. Climate was good. Will you get into whichever place you wish to? Say, where did you kiss? I kissed on her chin... Chin kiss. Don’t you ask what’s next? Ok, either you ask or not, next is the last The 23rd kiss... Yes, oh my god! Traditional Telugu girl Srilakshmi, Srilakshmi in traditional sari She asked me for a favor which shouldn’t be asked for There was mehendi on her hands and I was lucky She asked to put out the folds she inserted. My naughty mind was into a joy. Adjusting the folds and setting her sari. Placing my lips on her cute belly... Valuable kiss, kiss on the navel My love border is just a kiss away. Oh God, did you get only my house? One may even understand oneness but it’s tougher to understand the heart of a girl. So, what happened? The earth broke down. What? Break up Clarity, will you give some clarity? One simple rule! There are no phone calls from her after the break up! I am here and she somewhere else She said not to show up my face, Murthy They’d say so and will we stop going? Still, why did you come here? You should be going to that girl, right? I can’t force her. I can’t even catch the feet. My sixth sense is saying Subbarao that you’ll catch some time. See, these are real Hamlets with... Little children and this girl This girl everyday... You know she is a real kid with real needs and real feelings. But I have the right feelings. I have the right emotions and I’m the right person with right emotions. Use your mind a bit. Hey, Anand... I’m so sorry. I need that girl. I do... I really do Doctor, how? Please tell me Doctor? Simple Doctor, don’t joke Not a joke. It’s always simple. Ego... Fold that, keep it in your pocket and then go talk to that girl. Person has changed. Positive transformation! Cut! Guys, this is Tango and you guys have to be little more intimate. Get closer to her, look into her eyes Like this madam? Sri... Sri... I... I... I hid few things from you. But I never lied. I have real feelings for you I love you. I’m proud to say that I love you. Sri... Sri, I’ll be waiting at coffee shop tomorrow evening at 4’o clock. She sent me Why are you here? Anand Sir, she’s just coming out a bit. She’s disturbed. Please don’t disturb her again What’s this drama? Why am I talking to you? Listen to me for a minute. Please listen to me for a minute. Sri, why did that girl come when I asked you to come? Hasn’t she said why she came? Let me at least say what happened Why to say, I saw that, right? By then, even I don't know that I am in love with you. Until you left I didn't realized that I am in love with you. And you should give me a chance to explain what exactly happened. There was physical relation with Vishwa before Goa trip. To say precisely, I had even with others too But once after you said I love you, I’m physically with none Maybe I crossed that liking stage by then. But that day, what happened and what you saw are different. You wrote the script well. Script? That’s what happened that day. In real, once that feeling of love started inside... I... I feel everything new. You know, it’s just one on one and no room for anyone else. It’s just us - Ok, great. Bye Hey, please... You haven’t said sorry. Sorry! Sri, listen to me once. I’m really sorry. I’m really sorry... - Not once. Say sorry once every day. Say sorry for the whole month. I want to see for 30 days. Then, I will think about it. I need a message every day, one e-mail, WhatsApp message and all types of communications One meeting - Yes, one meeting every day. I was in a blind spot then as there wasn’t a proper communication, right? Now, I need complete communication. Like... Like 30 days trial period... 30 days... Ok? Hey, WhatsApp? I’m not there at all in social media. Did you see the phone I’m using? There isn’t any other button than the red and green buttons. I won’t use smart phones. - You’ll use It took six months to say sorry? Send it fast, I’m feeling hungry. What else did my dad leave? Wait for a minute, this guy’s look is different. Hello, what do you want? Give a good phone to brother. All you get here are good phones. I mean that phone in which we get this WhatsApp and messages Oh, that’s called as smart phone. Yes, that one - Is it that? This is smart phone This is very smart phone. You said WhatsApp and videos right? You can directly do films with this If you buy two of these, you get one free and when you buy three, just one free How many do you need? One is enough, for brother. Bro... Oh, that one? Cash or card? That is... - Understood. Hey, smart phone? When did you buy? You didn’t say? WhatsApp? Please... Ok, sorry. Why don’t you listen even when I’m pampering you? I’m waiting for your smiles, why don’t you excuse? Why do you keep me away seeing so angrily? Show some pity and fall in love with me again Past is past, sorry I’m so sorry, sorry I’m so sorry I promise on you, such won’t happen again, sorry I’m so sorry, sorry I’m so sorry.

I love you a lot, please be compromised, my princess. Thank you What’s this, you should take care, right? You have to take care of yourself Yes, I know. No other way to fight a few issues. Am I any Face book activist to share and forget? Are all these needed? Madam, this in the morning and this in the evening Okay. Ok, Seeing these I... Ok, you... Yes, that’s the problem. I’m still in... I’m still in love. I love you too. Shall we say in the house? What, this I love you? - No, not this but about our marriage. Marriage? Next is that, right? Sri, I don’t have a belief in this system called marriage What does that mean? Why? Because I don’t like bring in another child onto this earth, when so many children are dying every day It’s a sin and that’s why So, is your problem the children, marriage or me? Come on Sri... There are still 7 days left for our 30 day trial period to end, right? You should know much more - Enough Sir See this. No. Looks like you have great experience in sari selection I never selected for anyone other than sister. Sister drapes sari beautifully. Tell me, I would like to know more about your family members Mom, sister and grandpa are there. In a small village named Markapuram near Kodada Is sister married, does she have any children? Yes, married. But he left her and children... Ok, children? She also feels sin like you to have children? - Hey, nothing like that, she’s normal. Hey, I am also normal. Will I work so much for them if I don’t like the children? Many women and children are still sleeping with empty stomach even today in our country. It is pathetic Sri Come Srilakshmi, come in wealthy Goddess, you are my love Come by walk wearing my sari and bring in a smile Chanting for so long and my silent song, maybe you heard them today. You came back to me like my life, to say that you like me. Come Srilakshmi, come in wealthy Goddess, you are my love The breathe is like the vapor of summer thirst The night is like a great joy born The skies melted and came into my lap. The wound of distances is disappeared now Are you that beauty like a medicine to me? Come Srilakshmi, come in wealthy Goddess, you are my love No problem even if we have no children, but let’s be together for lifelong. Sure? Then, will you talk to Daddy? You think he will say yes? I told my dad that I will not do anything without his permission. So, we must take permission. Ok. Where did you get this chain?

I like her a lot Sir and I have that's why I came here. Then what? What is the reason? What is the real reason? I am not like all, who getting married and having children.
