* RED TOMAHAWK * General George Custer and his gallant soldiers, of the7th Cavalry, were massacred, on the morning of June 25, 1876. At dawn of the following day, while thousands of Sioux, still roamed the Black Hills of Dakota, the first to come Upon that carnage was Captain Tom York, special agent of the United States Army. Hi! Is anyone there? Good morning, young soldier Be welcome! My name is, Crone. Ned Crone. Tell me why you look so scared. The 7th Cavalry was slaughtered. You better get out of here quickly. Well, I'm sorry for the cavalry, but... I will not leave this land. It is best to let, the animal rest for a while. It looks like he's about to suffocate. I don't have time, I have to get to Deadwood and wire to Fort Bastion. Are you saying that all the Cavalry boys were killed? More soldiers are on the way. They could be ambushed, like Custer. So you better get going. I will stay here. My partner and I discovered wealth in this region. He's in town, to legalize the land and if I leave here, someone could come and take possession. Listen, friend. These hills are full of Indians. Mr. the Indian was not born yet that will get me out of here now. Hey, captain! And Custer? How is he doing? Has he already wiped out all the Indians? Are you the telegraph operator? Myself I have a message for Fort Bastion I can't send, because the wires must have been cut by the Indians. When General Custer is finished with them, we'll have the cables in order. Custer is dead. I don't believe it, Captain! Dead Custer! The entire 7th Cavalry was slaughtered, there was not a man left. What about the city? We are going to be slaughtered. They were slaughtered. Ten thousand Sioux must be around. I have to send a message. But there are no possibilities, Deadwood is isolated from the rest of the world. Maybe we can send messengers. If Custer is dead, there is no way to pass. Did you hear that? Custer is dead. Him and his entire army. Are you sure about that, Captain. I saw the bodies. The Indians will leave Deadwood in ash. Captain... I have a partner there, Ned Crone, Sir, did you see him? You had a partner there. What do you mean by that? He is dead. What did you do? Did you leave him there to die? What are you doing? What do you mean, what are we doing? I saw you two! You are completely mistaken. Fort Bastion... They were arrested, given amnesty to accompany General Custer. Who are they, Captain? He must have tied himself up, saw what was going to happen to him. I never thought of seeing a sniper as with an arrow to the neck. Oh!... My God! No, please! Not! It can not be. He is dead. Sal has been waiting for him for months. She used to come and wait. all due diligence. I wonder if this will be the last step to get here. All the Indians in the region will come and they will remove our scalps. Yes!... they will take off our scalps. Because? Because? Because soldiers like that are in the city, instead of fighting the Indians. What happened? The fight has become so bloody did you run away to hide? A coward! Traitor! People like you caused this! This captain is, a deserter. Look at him, without a scratch! Do you look like you were fighting the Indians? Not! Of course, I was with General Custer, but he ran away from the battlefield, the coward! Is that so, Captain? Well, look at him, and the only man, in uniform in this city. That's right. Are deserters! They are lying! The uniform doesn't lie. He speaks like this, to save filthy skin! Hey!... Hit hard! Lynch him! There will be no time for you o go to court, Captain. You should have stayed at Little Big House. Get your treats out of here!... You are at an advantage, don't you think guys? That's the advantage he gave Custer, none. Smith! It will be like fighting 50 men at the same time. Smith! If I attack again from Tom York, I'll make five holes in you. Do you know the captain? Of course yes. He abandoned General Custer. He does not belong to the 7th regiment. He is a government agent, seconded to the US Army. So, who were the guys who accused him? They were defectors, as I told you. Excuse me, Captain. Did you see the deserters well? Yes, I saw it, I think I could recognize them. Some deserters in the city? They must have been hiding, after they put the crowd against you, they set a beautiful trap for me. We will take care of you. Captain. If you see those two again, tell me who they are. Rest assured, I'll be aiming for them a 45. You look awful. I didn't get to see you either, two or three years ago. You used to give letters, in El Paso. Yes, for a while. Then I accepted the position of Sheriff in Tombstane. I heard that you "cleaned" the place in the blink of an eye. No. They always overreact to the story, Tom. You know it. Knowing him, I don't think so. And my feet, they itch. Did you come to Deadwood, after gold like the others? I don't, I'm carrying guns for Wells Fargo. They got here. Hmm! Well, unless we can get, in touch with the army, we are not going anywhere else. What you're saying is that the cavalry has divided in two by Custer, on the way to Little Big Hom? That's right. They came in two different directions. They came in a circle to reinforce the 7th regiment. And Custer will not be present. The only thing that will be there, are the Indians waiting for them. Therefore, it is necessary to alert them. You are very tired! To help? Let me see! At least three fast messengers will be needed. Three horsemen in two directions? One of them has to go to Fort Bastion to pick up the soldiers. It's ok. Three horsemen. I feel better. Three horsemen without their scalps. Yes. We will have to try. Do you have to try? No not me! No sir. Listen, Tom, somewhere in the mountains, the Indians are waiting, with bloody red axes and thirsty for more. This is not something to be done and no man in his right mind should do so. Do you think they'll attack Deadwood? I think so, don't you think? What chances of survival will we have then? What are the chances of people in the city? You have a chance to die, in very good company, friend. If we alert the soldiers, they would be ambushed by the Indians. Which is true, they go straight to the killing. If they are prepared, they will defeat the Indians. The Indians are in great numbers. But they will face them. Of course, they will face them, right but they will have a chance to defeat them, which Custer had. No, Tom. There is no chance, unless that has a much superior weapon Hey Tom, didn't you have some Gatling guns at the Fort? There were four, but Custer didn't want to bring them. He said they served to delay him. He wanted a quick victory on the field. Quick win... I can understand, President Grant and the generals just wanted, a quick victory. It was a lot of anxiety, I think. Why did you ask for machine guns? I heard that there are two of them here in the city. What? Don't get excited, Tom. I don't know where they are or who has them, or if they really exist. If that's true, it would give soldiers a chance, right? You won't like it, Tom. Okay, I won't like it. Your friend, Columbus Smith That's what this bull is called. who tried to pull my brains out? He knows almost everything is happening in this city. Where can we find him? When he had that "date" with you, he was taking the dirty laundry must be at Chinaman. So, come on. Get out of here now! What are you doing? The city went crazy. They counted on Custer. It seems that they will face the problem with the barriers. The Indians break the barriers. Hey you there! Put it here. Come on. Hear me out! Wait! Wait! You are fighting on the wrong side. The battle is within you. We will all die. Yes, we will die, but can't we die with dignity? A doomsday speech. Yes, the end of the world. The problem is that he may be right. It could be the end of Deadwood. If we don't get the machine guns, you can bet life that everything is lost. Please, Look at God before it's too late. Seek God. Apparently, he tried to cross the mountains. See what happens if we try. We will not try. If he accuses us of defecting the way he accuses us people will slaughter us and spit us out. Let's stay hidden. Perhaps the Captain will not see us. In a city this big? There is nowhere to hide. Sooner or later, we meet. But you can't find us if you're dead. A dead person cannot see anything. So, we have no alternative. We `ll kill him. Keep working! Keep walking! Hyah, hyah!... How can I wash this? It stinks! Nobody can wash. Hiu!... It stinks a lot, smell yourself, okay? It smells really bad, but try again, okay? Try the Lord! You wash! Hey, Captain! Problems with staff? No. He thinks he's still, in San Francisco. Colombo won it, playing cards over there. I wish I had lost it. Captain, I'm very sorry. You already told me that. It's always like that, Columbus knocks first and asks questions later. And as soon as I get into fights that's how I do We need a favor. If you can, I am at your disposal. There are rumors that machine guns, are here in the city Exactly. The army needs this. Quickly. I need volunteers to carry them, Smith. They are hidden. Can you take us to them? No, I can't, because I'm going to tell you something. Lil has them and she will give nothing in this world. Smith? Your skin, mine and that of men is at stake. Will she hear the voice of reason? Why don't you talk to her! If she accepts, will I go with you? At least I have a volunteer. Two, if she delivers them! Thank you, Smith. Lil's bar is over there. Do you know her well? No one in this city knows Dakota Lil well. Looks like you have friends everywhere, Tom. Are you one of the defectors? Yes he was! Place your bets, gentlemen. Please, make your bets. The bets are over. Black number 25. Place your bets, please. The bets are over. The bets are over. 17 black and advantage. Hey, why didn't you tell me, who knew her? Do not know. The bets are over, gentlemen's. Lil, where did you meet? Do not know! I think it's time for you two to get to know each other. I want to introduce you to a friend of mine, Captain Tom York. Tom, I introduce Lil McCoy. Captain! Finished bets, please, gentlemen's Captain, are you on business, or for fun? Business. And I think it's better to get straight to the point. Someone could replace you. Oh no! Never stop a game of chance. Place your bets, please, gentlemen's. The game of chance I'm here for could be your life. 13, red and Advantage Place your bets, gentlemen's. Lil... Could mean, the lives of us all. Maybe we better die. Place your bets, please. Place your bets, gentlemen's! Perhaps, madam, but I fear that is not your decision. And yours? Can't we speak in private? This is my private place. If you want to speak, speak! I wanted!... Speak! The Army is in need of machine guns. Double zero. The game is over! Because? I started just now. If you want to lose, your money, they will accept you there. And the subject of machine guns is closed. You know where they are, don't you? Two of them. I don't know anything about it. Where did you hide them? Lil, can't we sit and talk? What else is there to say? In this city it?s like that, nobody get in your business life. I have to get into this. Listen, Lil, the army is in dire need of machine guns. If Custer had these weapons, this story would have been different. Nobody's going to get their hands on those weapons. They can avoid, a useless massacre of soldiers. Soldiers who can fight thousands of Indians. I'm sorry! What kind of woman are you? I'm not the type you judge. If I knew what I think. Listen, very carefully, Captain. Some time ago, no one knew me as Dakota Lil. It was mother, wife... I don't want the story of your life, I want the machine guns! Wait, Tom! Let's hear it. Thanks! My husband and I had a ranch, around Deadwood. He was guarding, machine guns for your partner, when the Indians came. They killed my husband, my son and... they took me with them. But I didn't tell them where the weapons were hidden. I knew they could be used to kill innocent people. Listen, understand how you feel, but the situation is completely different now! These weapons cost the life, to my husband, my son... and my reputation as a woman. I swore that no one else will use them. And, believe me, Captain... No one will use them again. It's useless. We will achieve nothing. I don't know, Tom. I've never seen her like this. Perhaps it is better to give him time to think. We do not have time. Let's look for them. Where is the ranch? Columbus Smith must know. Come on. Mr. Elkins. Soon it will be dark. Yes! With each passing hour, soldiers are closer to Littte Big Hom. I can't forget the way she looked at you. I don't forget the way you refused to help us. You also looked at her, in a strange way. But there is nothing strange! Two Pairs! Three of the same suit. He was trying to win himself! Oh yes? Good luck. Did you do it? Not here! Smth! Do you know the lands that Lil and her husband had? Of course I know the McCoy land. They talked a lot, about the projects they had, for them and suddenly, he was killed. Very strange. Captain York looks like Ben McCoy. It refers to the fact that he is dead, this is how I feel. Did you ever see the McCoys' ranch? The ranch? It is a small hut outside the city. They wanted to make the place, a big ranch. Is very far? It is very close to here. We think McCoy hid his guns over there. Maybe you're right!... Come on, practice playing cards while I'm gone It looks like this is from the salon. It could be Lil. Let it go!... Sheriff! We need the guns in Deadwood. There are no weapons. We all heard the Captain! It will tell us where the machine guns are. Did you say machine guns? He doesn't know what he's talking about. Are two. One for each end of the city. Because. This will prevent the Indians from entering. It will take us to arms, or will be dead, when the Indians arrive. Let me! It's not going anywhere! All people out! Thanks. You were at a disadvantage. Come on, captain! Take her out of here. We need these weapons and plan to have them. It looks like I got you in trouble. We will meet back at the hotel. Not! We stay here. Listen take it. Come on! We can take care of these clowns. Are you on the side of the army? The Army is the only thing that can save our skin. Yes it's true. How Custer and his boys saved their skins. If it is, we will kill for these machine guns Even if they kill each other, you mean. Captain! When he entered the hall, it was not my intention to look at him that way. I answered the look, didn't I? For a moment, I thought I knew him. There is a Chinese in the laundry that said, that I look like with your husband. No, I don't think so. Do I look like someone you know? Nobody I remember. Ah! Weird! Charming! Two strangers. Who think they know each other. Captain. When, I said I needed, to of the machine guns, I was confused, but when I said I needed them to fight the Indians, then I realized that the Army really needs them. Will you tell us where they are? Yes. They are buried near the house where we lived. They must be rusty by now. They are wrapped in oily fabric. There are even four tripods. The population is all agitated. They think that machine guns will solve all their problems. They don't care, with the army. She told me where they are. Where? As we were thinking near the McCoys' house. We better saddle the horses. I will get a cart in the meantime. Listen, you two, dig up the weapons. Maybe it's a good idea, if I'm going to hit the ground so, to give the Army clues about the location of the Indians. Wait! You're not going to walk the hills alone, are you? It is my obligation. The machine guns are dismantled. Do any of you know how to assemble them? I can not. I could try, but that's it. York, he's an expert, in arms. Ep, what do you think about the two of us going to check out the hills? It seems that there is nothing more to do in the city. Stop worrying, we are not going to get in the middle of the Sioux. We still want to keep our scalp. You can see their fires in the distance. Okay, but I suggest that you take different directions. Ep... you are going south... Do not say. I know. North Right! So! Hide the horses and the cart when they return to the city. By then, I will have the weapons assembled. Aren't you going with her to the ranch? Hmm... maybe it's a good idea. Those hooligans, out there we better get out the back. And we better get together first, Tom. I'll give you some time. We will meet before nightfall, God willing for all of us. Captain, and Lil are already coming here? I didn't know they were at the hotel. Did you know, Smith? I didn't know, either. You leave the key. Why don't you go and see? Come on. Elkins? You were right, they were there. I saw them going out the back. If we run, we?ll get the machine guns. Come on! We have company! If someone follows us to the machine guns the whole city will know, their location. The door is open Elkins! Elkins! Yes. Did you get to see them? Yes, they came out from behind, when we show up. Very smart! We can go after them, I have no better idea. They will take us, to machine guns. We will follow them. Make sure they don't follow us this time. One less. The other is already going. Are you sure you know how to assemble them? I'll try to mount. After all, how was it that your husband, obtained these weapons? He and his partner, Red Sawyer, decided to buy weapons at very low prices. They thought. It is the same as buying a white elephant at a low price. They intended to sell them to the army. The army does not buy second-hand equipment. They realized that. These weapons are not brand new. They were made in 1865, which was the year that Catling changed the cylinders. They used to accumulate gases, in the barrel cylinders and explode in the sniper's face. When they were unable to sell them to the army, Sawyer made a deal to sell to the Indians. My command did not allow him to carry on this business. They had a horrible argument. My husband buried them. And Sawyer told the Indians, that if they wanted to the guns had to get them at the ranch. They really left them to us, didn't they? Perhaps it would be better not to kill him? He has already dug his grave without the weapons. Take the machine guns and leave him alone It has already caused many problems. Weapons are useless if they don't have ammunition. Check for ammo. What kind of projectile is used? 58 caliber, special! They have to be there. No, they were not buried with weapons. It makes no sense. Yes it's true. Because if the Indians found them, there would be no ammunition so they would be useless She must be right. There is no ammunition here. Your husband thought of everything. I will make a deal with you. Leave the Captain alone. And I will tell you where the ammunition is. Will say anyway. When I'm done with you will tell me everything The Indians thought that, but I didn't say anything to them. You are quite insensitive. If you are lying, tell your Captain that we will be back and not only will we kill you, but you will also Where are the ammunition? They are buried beside the Court on East Front Street. Captain... Captain. Tom? Who is it? Smith. I had never seen so many Indian bonfires in my life. Did you go north? I don't need a compass to know where the North is. I do not know. I saw many fires in the south. The city is living hell. They are looking for riots. Open the door Columbus Smith, I saw him come in. Who is it? And Kane. Ep! Tell me, Kane, were you the one who fired the shot? I shot in the air, to scare them. These guys are looting the city. You don't seem to have scared them too much. If we don't act rigorously, Deadwood will be adrift, lawless and out of control. We have to stop them. The only thing we should stop is the Indians on the hills. You have a civic duty to help the city. To hell with the city! I have a greater duty to the army! I hope you know what you're doing. We expect the same. I hate to take this cart. The weapons are heavy, Smith. Yes, I know it will slow us down. But let's go. I will help you load. It's ok. Thank God! I thought I would never open my eyes again... Uh, of course. The way my head is hurting, I think I was dying. Elkins and the other men tried to kill him. Yes, it's a shame that they didn't. Do not say that. I don't even have to ask about the machine guns... They took them. Ep and Columbus Smith. Ah!... Ah!... have they arrived yet? Not me... I didn't see them. They should be here by now. I told Elkins where the ammunition is. Because? Was necessary. You told them not, to kill me. Many people died, uselessly because of these weapons. There will be many more deaths if you do not recover them. Wait, your friends will help you find them. With every minute that passes... There is no more hurry. It's raining and the attack, Deawood is not immediate. I know the Indians. I know what you're thinking. I was thinking. I still haven't thanked you for saving my life. Oh no! Are you wondering if there is anyone who knows about the Indians, I am that person. No, no, Lil. Do not torment yourself. You are right, I know them well. I managed to escape, finally. But she was someone else, no longer a wife or a mother. Or... the simple Ohio girl who had been and who had married my husband. Your husband... was a man who had a dream right? And when the dream died, I died... But now it?s night, the inhabitants of the city have gone mad, with the idea that the Indians would massacre them. I don't think I'm her anymore. And you are not! I don't know who I am or what I am... not even life, after all. Life is nothing, but an endless game. And I spend all my time making the wrong combinations. It may be, but that's over. Why did you say that? Is there anyone else who can do it? Do not. I'm tired of missing combinations. Everybody is. you are not the only one I am tired of pretending that I am insensitive. It is not insensitive at all. So who am I? No Lil... No, no. If you're thinking about kissing me, I don't even know what that is anymore. Lil... Has the Captain set up the machine guns yet? Gone. They were stolen a few hours ago. Were they ambushed? There were four men. I recognized one of them, it was Elkins. What about the captain? Was he kidnapped or what? No. He... he went out a while ago. She must turn the city upside down to take up arms. The ammunition was buried next to the court. He said he would go first. Lil keeps an eye on the horses, fine. The best you can do is stick around. They blocked the two entrances to the city. Damn you who don't realize that there are many ways to get into the city. The Sitting Bull knows them all. I'm sure of it. I believe so. They don't know that the Sitting Bull is going to get around the barriers. And I'll tell you something, if you're crazy enough to get back to roulette, you will enter a bar full of hyenas, drunk and scared. I think today, we're all pretty scared. Lil told us the story of Elkins and his friends. They even have the ammunition. Elkins has a freight company. Maybe we can find him there. Perhaps... but unless he knows, what are you doing, or it will take a long time to assemble the weapons. He doesn't know that we know. This means that he is waiting for us. EIkins will regret not killing me. Because? We can mount machine guns, we can't. What if he has already assembled them? So, we have 58 Caliber for breakfast. There he is! Ep! See if you can get there and get in the back. Smith, come over there and appear from the side. It's ok! Hey Elkins! You better hurry up. Elkins. Want to try it yourself? Don't shoot! Do not shot. We surrender! Let's go out. Captain! We need the damn weapons at Deadwood! If we take them, to the Army in time, the Indians will not approach Deadwood. That's what you say. We don't believe that. The guns are here, in Deadwood! Have you ever been in front of a machine gun before? This weapon is not complete. It is mounted enough to make holes in your body. As I already said, Captain. We will not allow to take Deadwood machine guns lightly! None of them! You, Ep Wyatt and Columbus Smith are going to have to fight the city. I believe him. I think you better believe that. He will return, with a raging crowd. Maybe I can make a foul in time. You mean, it?s not working? You should see him bluff in a poker game. I'll get the horses. A weapon will not destroy, the entire city. They will not let you out of town with machine guns. These weapons will have no use for them. One at each end of the city, the Indians do not attack like that they will surround the city. Don't get me wrong, Captain. I'm on your side, I agree. The Army that fights with the Indians. But can you take the weapons in time? We will try, for sure. Why aren't you running away in fear? I'm scared to death. I'm just not running away. We have to hurry, Captain. I'll get the cart. You said that Gatling had trouble marketing this model. After he invented it, the factory was destroyed by fire and had to start over. That was in 1862. Then they produced machine guns, in time for the war. It was never used even though Gatling wrote to Lincoln. Old Abraham, never made many mistakes. Several of his generals committed. The Gatling machine gun appeared in North Carolina. They feared that he might have the sympathy of the Confederates. They assumed that if they hired him, to manufacture the machine guns, he would then organize an attack to steal them. They would be in the line of fire, with the weapons they bought and paid for. We have to get the machine guns back. If we don't, we will be dead. Gather the Massev brothers and evacuate the bars, we will gather a crowd. We need to recover the weapons. Let's get them!... Captain, the crowd is arriving at any moment. Where are they? Where are the what? Both weapons are missing cylinders. We will reload them and pick them up, on the way. It's no use. Without cylinders, weapons will not work. There is no point fighting for weapons that don't work. Tom! I looked for you everywhere. I heard you were here. Did you hear that they were after of us? They are really coming. Well not only hid it, the ammunition elsewhere, but it also hid the cylinders elsewhere. Wow! What a beautiful memory. Well, it's not worth having the guns, if they don't work. You're absolutely right. We are back in action. Is everything loaded? All ready. Turn around. That's it. What a strange way to say goodbye. We had a strange arrival, didn't we? Ep, if you ever go back, to Deadwood. Try your luck at roulette. Of course yes. There, in those woods. This is what the Sitting Bull calls the first perimeter. I was there last night. Warriors watch over the city. I found the same thing on the other side. How did they get through? There are only a few Indians here. The main battalion is miles away, waiting for the army. I walked between the guard posts, but it was dark and I was riding a horse. This is different. I'll go ahead and attract them, on this path. I think I better go with you. Wait a minute, they'll be in the middle of a battle. This is the idea. Keep them busy so you can go with the cart. They will attract many warriors. If they took the machine guns. I can't take them on horseback. So said Custer. Machine guns are holding us back from the city. Besides that... when they fire they wake up, all the Indians within a radius of kilometers. And I'm going to tell you something, partner, it's better not to shoot unless it's necessary. Good luck, Smith. Thanks! I don't think I gave Columbus enough time for him to pass. In fact, you didn't. He belonged to Custer's regiment. It belonged. I think it's as close as two people can get in without losing their scalp. Well, at least we left the perimeter. Now, let's cross the Sioux Nation. How long does it take, to put the wheel back? Depending on the help you receive Bring the ammo box. It's ok. Are you ready? Wait a second. We can put it now. It's all right... you can go down. Now turn this over. You told Kane that whoever invented this weapon was a rebel. No. Dick Catling was totally neutral, but when the Yankees generals were convinced the war was over. Come on. Come and help me, right? It's done!... Enough is in place. Oh well!... Ep, help me with this gun. It seems to me that all fractions, I would have needed those "girls". Of course yes. Older models fired 50 bullets, per minute. These are the 1865 models. They fire more shots. What about the latest models! The ones Custer didn't want to take with him? They're even better. But the old Yellow Hair was too busy trying to be a hero. And perhaps they would have been, if he had taken the machine guns. I think everything is in order. Let's move. In this type of terrain we will pass, the time spoiling the wheels. Let's go as soon as possible! If you run aground, it won't be too fast. This wheel will not take it, much longer. Advance! A war group. We have reached the crucial point of the Sioux. The secret is to go unnoticed. The secret is in getting, arriving is a broken wagon to the Arrow Point Peninsula. Unless the plans have changed, Battalions A and H must be arriving in this Zone. Do you think you can convince them to meet there and take a stand? With the help of a battalion of soldiers from the fort. Battalions A and H and soldiers from the fort don't know about your plans. After we hid the weapons at Arrow Point, Ep and I are going to meet with the troop commanders to alert them. You go to Fort Bastion, pick up soldiers. I hate to talk about it, Captain! But Arrow Point, is in the middle of Sioux territory. It is more or less the same situation that Custer had to face. You know this is what I like, you always have something positive on the tip of your tongue. It would be a shame to take this, for a single war. Yes. We would have the Sitting Bull, above us. Hopefully it is not necessary. Come on. There is still much? I'm afraid there are 8 or 9 km to go. Indians! Will they come back? Yes, a million friends with feathers. Let's get out of here. I went fishing at Arrow Point once. Hopefully that?s what we?re going to do, with Gatling machine guns. Both are ready to act. The problem is in attracting the Indians. I hope this plan works. I would like to try the machine guns on the Indians. It's ok. Go to the fort. Do you know the way? Yes I know. You go further. Take my horse. It's ok. Battalion H must be very close by. In the Southwest. What about battalion A? South-west, across the river, a few hills from here.? If you can stay high, you can see them. Tom... You know, of course, that there are Indians across the river and along those hills. What are you trying to say? Bye!... We?ve said goodbye before. Hey. Smith? Say it. When you return, from the fort with the soldiers... Let's go fishing. It's the first time, that I'm going, in a fishery where I am the bait. Hei today... Hei today! Hei, today!... Company, loud! Captain York! Are you, sir? What the hell are you doing here? Where's the rest of your battalion? They camped farther away. If they are further ahead, what are they doing here? We are checking the terrain, there are Indians everywhere. We are completely surrounded. Well, as General Custer once said, "a man must die with his boots on". This is exactly what he did. That was not funny, Captain. I know it wasn't. But it is the truth. The remaining hope is that the 7th Cavalry it would be enough to get us out of this situation. So we were checking the terrain, we were looking for General Custer. Lieutenant, take your men across the river at Arrow Point. Captain, if we go in any direction, the Indians are falling on us. We have two Gatling guns at Arrow Point. I understand!... The captain needs a horse, you two ride on the same horse, until we get to the battalion. Let's get the men together, Captain and let's go quickly to Arrow Point. Company, move forward!... Let's move faster!... Attack, attack, attack!... Ahead, march! Disassemble! Take cover quickly! Hey, you two! Hurry with that gun! Quickly! Captain, allow a civilian to fight with us. And you better ask him, if he will allow us to fight him. Hide behind the rocks! Quickly! Quickly! Here they come! Hide, yes? Go there! Where are the soldiers in the fort? Do not come. Colombus did not survive, we saw his body on the way back And the most beautiful sight I have ever seen. Yes, it is a pity that Custer was unable to see her. Or Columbus Smith. You know, Captain, I just thought, that you were a dead man. We all died! Do you know what I think? This could be the starting point, in the war against the Sioux tribe. I hope you're right. All right, gentlemen's, place your bets. No one else! Number 17. Never stop a game of chance. The game of chance that can last a lifetime. I mean, the rest of your life. Gentlemen's... this game is over. You heard the lady, this game is over. Come on, I'll buy you a beer. "FIM"
