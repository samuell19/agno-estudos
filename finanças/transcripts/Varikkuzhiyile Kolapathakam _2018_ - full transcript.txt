Where the notes of a melody... ...are scattered playfully by the wind... ...the harvests are full and goodness rules; such is my village Where merry waves slip and slide... ...like a talkative mirror... ...and the water hyacinths bloom; such is my village Where treasures found deep within... ...are safe in the golden vaults of our hearts... ...we join hands to safeguard them; such is my village Where tiny dragon flies wake us with their flitting and hopping... ...and float around in beauty; such is this nice village All around us is a charming lake... ...wherein every day... ...a moss-coloured sheath of water plants... ...go round and round Baby bats, in the dark of the night... ...c:ome searching for tender coconut scraps And the stealthy black crows... ...are chased away with stones by naughty little boys For mischievous kids... ...its a place lovely to visit! For the tiny crabs that sting your feet... ...its a place full of fun! Little ones and elders... ...share blisters from rowing oars... In tearful moments... ...they stand with you -that's the kind of hearts we have! United in vision; we stand as one With kindness as deep as the lake Our dreams are one and so is ourjoy... With honesty up to the skies! We are together in keeping sadness away... We shield each other with joy, such is our way See a festoon of clouds and we long for thunder... Quite like a wishful little girl The rhythms of thunder weave joy in our hearts... And it has many tales to tell, my village! At dawn and at dusk... ...the sunlight throws bright colours around This lake and its tiny, gurgling ripples ...echo with the strains of a boat-song The lofty tops of coconut trees... ...look at themselves in the water! There are calls from the opposite banks... And the circling around of nets Mouths full of delicacies... and stomachs full of drink... Such are the folks in this island, you'll find E E I like your twisted ideas and shady business deals But keep it to the other side of Venduruthy bridge Don't bring it to this side Brother Isaac, please listen to me I was talking to both of you I don't need any intermediaries for this business Brother! I can make it so this benefits us both Listen, son! The reason I made you sit down is not your whites or your MLA status That old grandfather of yours? It's only for his sake! Who's that now? Oh! He's here! -You may leave. Go on! - Come, let's go - Uncle! - Come, quick - Looks like he duped us -I don't care Here comes the Priest-Goon We just wasted time Hi! Uncle! Come here, you!

She's grown thinner She's just growing taller - Father? - Yes? Would you change out of those robes? I need to talk You can talk even if I am in my robes Are you going to abuse me? When you are in your robes, even your own father has to call you 'Father' - That you should. Shouldn't you? - Idiot! Amy? Are you a Priest or a goon? Haven't I told you not to get into shady stuff? I swear, dad! Sometimes when people get out of hand, I advise them Some of them listen. When they don't I slap them around, just a bit That's our system out there and they like it! Em a Isn't it a sin to use your fists on those who come to Confess? What sin? Jesus himself tells me sometimes... ...to go ahead and rough some guys up. I give it to them good in my Chambers Look here! if I don't obey the Lord then that is the sin! The Priest does as the Lord says, got it? - And look who is talking, mom! - Ok, ok. Stop it Sherin - do you know how this one ended up being a Priest? So you're going to humiliate me now?

Why would they decide something you may not like? But now... I have a wish To take a vow that I will make you a Priest What do you think, son? Only if you like the idea No, dad! I want to be a Policeman. I want to bash everyone up! Who said Priests can't bash up people? a mm But I still want to be a Policeman, dad -Go on, tell him... -Ok... maybe... ...I think I have an idea First you grow up, finish your studies... ...go for Police training, grow big muscles...

Let's do that So first you become a Policeman A Policeman who bashes up the bad guys You look great, son! The uniform looks good on you! For 18 years, I have sat in for Passing-Out parades Do you know how many officers wore the uniforms I stitched... ...and turned into super officers? - Dear Ikka! - May you do web', son!

Let's talk over a cup of tea at the Police Station You mean at your dad's second wedding? Talk over tea? If you have anything to say, say it my lawyer here - You! Come and get in the car here! - Leave me, man! While I am still alive... ...you thought you would make it to the Station with my boy? a an You - go and change out of that uniform!

Your husband isn't too far behind either! That's true! You are a new bride right now - So many more stories to tell! - Ya! Much bigger than this! If you hear it all, you might run back home! And lastly, I have one more thing to say There is an old custom of settling scores during the Church Festival - True! - That can't happen this time If you have anything to settle, do it before the Festival Seniors and women and kids are going to be at the Festival If anyone makes any ruckus amid all that... ...the one hitting, the one getting hit and the ones watching... ...will all get it from me! That will be the Church's contribition. For free! Father Ponnezhan has specifically instructed me... ...about this So if anyone makes any trouble, you will have it from me! {mm} If it's about eve-teasers, I will take care of that too! No, it's not that. This is something we talked during the last Festival Once the Festival flag is raised, we should serve food to all devotees a Em - That's true! - Ours is not a rich parish Once the flag goes up, there will be devotees from both sides of the lake Whoever turns up at whatever time, we should be able to feed them - True! - We should take up the responsibility Father -I would be happy to pay forthat Great!
