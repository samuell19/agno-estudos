Fella? Are you all right? Hey man, you all right? And it's a going live. You betcha. - There you go. - Thank you. Thank you. Stop looking at that card, Luke. God damn, it pains me. Hey, sweetheart. - What can I do for you? - Hi. Can I get a popcorn, please? Why, yes you can. Thank you. So, you having fun tonight? - Oh yeah, how about you? - Now that's good. Oh, great time, great time. There you go. That'll be $2, please. Oh, great, there you go. - There you are! - Thank you. - All right. - Hurry up! - Colt's about to ride. - Oh shoot, already? Yes! Anyway, I was looking at that. Ladies and gentlemen, cowboys and cowgirls. Before we get on with the rest of our bull riding, I'd like to take a moment to thank our sponsors for hosting this 63rd annual Coalera Fall roundup. It's my pleasure to introduce to you one of those gracious sponsors. He's a businessman, a rancher, and one of Capitan's own. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Mr. Richard Hall. God. Rancher, my ass. Yeah, only horse he's been on was at the carnival. Thank you! Thank you! You folks enjoying yourselves tonight? Glad to hear it. Well, the bulls are getting anxious so I won't take too long. I just wanted to say that as a member of this community I feel a deep pride and responsibility to this land and it's people. And it's because of this commitment that I've decided to run for mayor of Capitan. I wanna be the voice of every hardworking person in this town. A campaign that will spark hope and prosperity for the people of Capitan! All righty, let's get this party started. It's a nice chilly night here in Capitan and next up is our very own Colt Skeen riding the heavy -footed Ironside. Coming out of chute number one. Not to add any pressure, but it's top score that wins the night and puts him in a tie for first place in overall points. Hold on to your britches, boys and girls. Coming outta chute number one, Mr. Colt Skeen. All right, way to go, Colt, well done. Heck of a ride, son. Ooh, that's a nice score there. We're waiting for the judges. As soon as we get a score we'll move on to our next cowboy. Colt! You did it. Told ya I would. Hey, not here. If my dad sees. Let's get outta here then. Excuse me, Colt? Tate with the Lincoln County Free Press. Congratulations on your ride. Can I snap a picture for the paper? Sure. Where you going? Get in here with me. Ready? Great. Do you got a minute for a quick interview? Sorry, bud. I'm busy. What's wrong, mister? Too many noises? Place is too crowded. Let's get outta here. Go back to our spot. Tonight? You don't wanna stay here and celebrate with your friends? Not if you're giving me a choice. I have to be home by midnight or my dad will kill me. I'll get you home by midnight. Yeah? Come on. Hurry up. Oh, that sounds like someone having too much fun. Yeah, they're probably just getting started. Yeah, well he'll be ragged by morning or in a cell. Yep. How is the coffee, June? It's bittersweet. You're telling me. You know... It really feels bad, and I'm not fooling, it does, to say goodbye to the best person that ever worked here. No, I'm really serious. It's true. It's gonna take a lot more convincing than that, big E. All right. Is that the ring? Can I see it? Oh. Okay. Come on, stay a little while. Yeah, but you're happy here. I'm an old skinny man, sweetheart. I'm not... I came here to die, not to live. Yeah, well, people around here don't call it living anyway. They call it surviving. Right. Hey, let me ask you, you goin' to that rodeo tonight? Hell no. Nothing but trouble ever happens down there. Oh, hell. It's not that bad, come on. Are you going? Hell no. Dorothy, do you need a warmup? No, thank you. I'm good. Earl. Okay, you got it. Thank you. Yeah. When I was a kid I lived in San Diego. It was beautiful. Weather was just right. People always seemed so happy. Seems like forever ago. I've never been to the ocean. If you had, you probably wouldn't be here. Why's that? Because people who make it outta here don't ever look back. We should take a trip. You and me. I got this RV. We could load it up and just take off that way. Stay for a week or two. Whatever. Mean it? Yeah. Why not? Did you tell anyone we were coming out here? It couldn't be your dad, right? Well, I don't think so. What time is it? Oh shoot. Yeah, who is it? Is it him? I don't see anyone. What do you want? If Josh and the boys are peepin' on us I'm gonna whoop their ass. Let's just go. Stay here. All right, stop fuckin' playing! Fuck. Colt? Colt? Colt, stop it, this isn't funny. Hey, Marie. What can I get ya, sweetie? - Just coffee, black. - Hey, Tommy. Hey. Give me a sec, eh? Thank you. Of course. Let me talk to George. Beth. Beth, here you go. Wait, wait. Hold it, hold it. Table three. Which one's table three? One, two, three. - Fine. - You got it. Tommy, kid. Big E. How you doing? Oh, just about as good as one can. Hey, listen. You seen June around here somewhere? June already turned her keys in. You know. What do you think of her replacement? What's wrong with that? Yeah, listen Earl, what you trying to run around here? A hunting ranch or something? I'm trying to get you a decent date. Well, keep trying. All right. So, what's the, uh... What's the occasion? You haven't heard, I can tell that. No, apparently not. Now, that's surprising to me considering the fact that news travels faster in this town than a wildfire. The daughter of your favorite person went missing last night. You talking about Maddie? Yeah, I am. Well, do ya blame her? Richard's turning over every rock to find his daughter and Colt. What? Colt Skeen? Yeah. I mean shit, maybe they just split town together or something. Yeah, that'd be a welcome thing, wouldn't it? I'll tell ya what. It's a shame Richard ain't the one gone missing. Shit, yeah. God damn. Just take a look at that and tell me what you think. This picture, when was it taken? Yesterday evening. The kid won another buckle. Just feels like this town's falling apart, man. You know that's right. Yeah. Earl, do we have blueberry pancakes? One second. Can I ask you something? When you see June would you tell her I miss her already? Is it in the menu? No. Then no. William County Sheriff's Office. Is the sheriff around? He ain't. I don't imagine he will be any time soon. Is this an emergency? Sir? Well, ma'am, I mean... It could be nothing, but I might've found something to help you find those kids. Those missing kids. What's your name? Uh, Tommy. Tommy Williams. What is the information you would like to pass along? Will you tell him check up north? Up there past Rancherman's Campground. What makes you think this is where they might be? Tire tracks. Tire tracks? Yeah. Tire tracks. Just trust me. Okay, I'll pass it along. All right, bye. Get in. Come on. Oh my god. God has nothing to do with this, son. This is work of man. What do we do now? - Go over there. - Yeah. Over here. Jesus Christ, what is going on? What the hell? Oh, my God. Now the hard part comes. Telling the folks about this. It's gonna set the town on fire. Maybe we should wait a minute. No, folks need to know to lock their doors tonight. Time to start asking some questions. Let's call this one in. How you doing, cowboy? Just another day in paradise. And you? It'd be paradise if it'd rain. Well, I guess that's the least of our worries, though. What do you mean? Your old buddy hasn't been over to visit? Sheriff Stone was beating on my door trying to ask me 20 questions before I could even pull on Levis. Telling me they found those kids dead up there north of the Cattleman's Campsite. What? Both of 'em? Yep. What, was it a scuffle gone bad or something? Murder. Didn't tell me much. Seemed kinda shook up and all. My guess is he'll be asking you the same 20 questions. Well, I'm gonna go ahead and roll on. I don't wanna miss out on any gossip. All right, Ronnie, I'll see you around. You let me know when you start brandin'. I'll be givin' you a call. Tommy. You like my barn? Yeah. Figured you'd be out here. Look, can I help you with something? Just making the rounds to ask a few questions. Cut right to the point. We got a situation on our hands here. It seems you know a lot about it. The murders? Yeah. How'd you know? Ronnie told me, I just saw him on the road. He also told me Stone was asking him the same questions. Well, seeing as it's close to home for you guys we're going around all the neighbors to ask if they've seen or heard anything. What happened to 'em? Can't give out that information. You mind telling me what you were doing last night? Are you shittin' me? Just doing my job, Tommy. I was home. - Alone? - Yeah. What were you doing around midnight-one? Am I a suspect or something? Gotta ask. I mean, last time we had trouble at the ranch was you shot up some boy's truck instead of calling us. Yeah, they shot my bull. Lucky I didn't shoot them. It used to be your family's land, ain't that right? No, we leased it for a little while till it got bought. Split up. By Maddie's father, Richard. Listen, my land butts up to that, all right? Now, I saw some tracks that aren't usually there and I didn't have to call it in. So... They've been after you and Ronnie's land for quite awhile now, right? They went after everybody's land. All right? Fence is about the only thing holding back the subdividers. Sounds like a motive, Tommy. Why don't you get the fuck off my property? Yeah, we'll just see what Mr. Hall has to say about that when I tell him. Thanks for your cooperation, by the way. As always. Oh, hey. Heard your sister's leaving town. Some Army boy? Guess I should've figured, you know, she does have the reputation of the quickest turnaround in town. Sure will miss her, though. I will miss seeing that sweet face of hers. Do you think that badge is gonna protect you? You forgotten how things work around here? Is that a threat? Anybody can make a threat, Luke. It's commitment that sets man apart. Take care of yourself, Tommy. I'll be seeing you. You have two old messages. October 4th at 2:38 p.m. Hey, it's Ryan, bud. Give me a ring when you get this. Amber's trying to plan a little get together for June. Anyway, give me a buzz. New message. October 5th at 6:21 p.m. Tommy, it's been a week. You can't keep ignoring me. Look, I know you're upset, but I need to see you before I leave. If you get this, give me a call or I'm gonna drive out there and see you. End of messages. Shit! Damn, you look like you smell good, girl. 20 on two. All right. That'll be $22.50. Out of 40. How you doing today? Fine. Good. 50 cents makes 23, 24, 25. And five makes 30 and 10 makes 40. Have a good day. Huh? Are we going to your place? How about I meet you there? Hey, yo, bitch! Thanks. Fuck this place. Shit. You're kidding me. Going a little fast, weren't you? That's not why you stopped me. No, I wanted to talk to you. We have nothing to talk about, Luke. We have nothing to talk about? Are you really leaving town with some stranger? He's not a stranger. I don't have to explain this to you. Look, I miss you. Don't touch me. Oh, wow. Wow. Okay. Okay. Well, just so you know, I just left your brother's place. Seems he may have gotten himself into a little bit of trouble. What do you mean? Well, you know, we found those missing kids dead in a ditch smack dab between his and Mr. Hall's place. Oh, and guess what. He led us straight to them. And? And it seems a little coincidental, don't you think? It sounds like you're just grasping at straws to me. Maybe you're right. Maybe you're wrong. Either way, I guess he's on his own this time. Give me a ticket or get outta my way. You have fun in Germany with your new man, ya hear? What the hell? Go ahead! Sparkle gel or leaf green? Leaf green, but we're almost out of icing. Oh shit. Na, na, na. No, not like that. Well, be my guest. It's all in the details. Nice and easy. You know we're just gonna eat that anyway. Keep it up, I'm gonna show you nice and easy. Now that's more up my alley right there! Hey, Tommy. What do you think the cake should say on it? I don't know. Maybe "Good luck". How about a big heart. Or that. I gotta say, man. You clean up nice. You smell great, too. Yeah? Well, I appreciate that, buddy. She's pulling up, she's pulling up, she's pulling up. Here we go, here we go. - Places- - Places, people. Shit, the light, the light. Hey, Tommy. You in here? - Surprise! - Surprise! Whoa! - Oh my god. - Babe! Sorry. Come on. Oh, my god. I can't believe this. You guys did all this for me? Well... Tommy got the balloons. Is that right, bud? Are you okay? Oh, my goodness! Thank you. You're welcome. Are you okay? You want a beer? - You want a beer? - Yes. You need another beer? Another bruise. You might need some ice for your butt, too. Thank you. You're welcome. What time you want me to pick you up in the morning? It's all right, I was thinking I'd just stay here tonight. Well, what about your stuff? It's been loaded for a week. Is this what you really want? Yeah. You don't sound so sure. Why don't you like him? I mean, June, I hardly know the guy. And he certainly didn't do a damn thing to try and change that. Well, Fort Bliss ain't just a hop and a skip away, Tommy. Well, it was for you. Look, Tommy. I get this isn't easy for you to understand. Okay, trust me, it's not easy on me either. But this is what I want. You've been looking to get outta this town for about as far back as I can remember. Now, is this what you really want or are you just looking for your ticket outta here? You're supposed to trust me. I don't trust him, June. What happens you go all the way over there, okay? And he ain't the great guy you thought he was. What then? I gotta go all the way to Germany to kick his ass? So what? You just want me to stick around here? Work at the diner my whole life, end up just like Mom and Pop. Old and dead before my time. Oh, don't bring Mom and Dad into this. No, you're just as stubborn as Dad was. This town is burning up quicker than the grass around here, Tommy. I really hope you find a way out like I did. One of yours? No, not mine. Come on. Don't worry, June, oof. Girl's got some fire in her blood. Yeah, tell me about it, man. She says I'm the stubborn one. She ain't ever listen to nobody about nothing. Ah, she'll be all right, man. She's a smart girl. Smart, no doubt. Poor choice in men, though. Hey, boy. Whatcha doin' out here, boy? Hey. Good boy. Wonder where the rider is. I believe this is Ronnie's horse. Maybe he rode him back from the bar again. Yeah, it'll take ya a week to get back from the bar on this old boy. Yeah, probably two. Well, hell man, I'm not too drunk. I'll help you trailer him up, take him back. That's all right, man. Actually, I think I'm gonna ride him back. Gonna ride back? I could use the air anyways. Do Ronnie a favor, get his carriage back home. Tell the girls I'll be back in a few. There's a case of 30 in the bar if you get thirsty. Gotcha, man. Where's Tommy? One of Ronnie's horses got out so Tommy took him back. I knew he'd be looking for a good excuse to get outta here. Hey, this is supposed to be a celebration. - Yes, babe. - Let's start making it feel like one. - Boom. - Thank you. Let's get this party started. Put that down, put that down. Dish time is done. Looking out there isn't gonna make him come any sooner. I know. Tommy. Son of a bitch. Knew I could count on you. Ladies! Guess what I got out! This time tomorrow you'll be getting close to seeing Matthew. Yeah. Come on, aren't you getting excited? It's kinda hard to be excited with everything that's going on. Someday we'll look back and laugh about all of this. I just have this sick feeling in my stomach. It's just your nerves talking. Help! Ronnie! - Let me out! - Get away from her! Get out! Get out! Hey, fuck you! Get, go! Son of a bitches. Hello? Hello? Hello? Tommy? Tommy? Fuck. I'm excited to see you. Can hardly wait, really. But um. I'll see you soon. All right, I love you. Bye. Don't you look at me like that unless you mean it. What are you talking about? You know exactly what I'm talking about. You get me all riled up and then fall asleep. Well, don't start fussin' or I will. Glad to see I can still make you blush. Where you going? I'm going to check on Tommy. Go back to sleep, babe. I'll be right back. Tommy? Tommy. Tommy. Hey. What happened, boy? Where's Tommy? Amber. Wake up. June? What are you doing? Where's Ryan? I don't know, he... He said he was going to check on Tommy. When? How long ago was that? I'm not sure. Get up, get dressed. We're gonna go find 'em. June, what's going on? You're scaring me. June. Something's not right. June. Get dressed. Oh, my God. June. What is it? Amber. We've gotta get to Tommy's truck. The keys, where are the keys? Get down. What the hell is going on? It's an animal call. What? The sound of the dying rabbit, it's used to call coyotes. Do you think it's the boys? They've been messing with us? No. Amber. What is that? Amber! Oh, my God. It's Ryan! - What did they do to him? - Stay inside. Stay inside. Oh, my god. He's here. Let him go! I said let him go! June, don't shoot. He has Ryan! Run! Shit. We're gonna get out of this. No, we're not. Look at me, Amber. We're gonna figure a way out of this but I need you to stay with me. Why are they doing this to us? They're trying to scare us out of here. They're gonna kill us. They're not gonna kill us. We'll stay here till the sun comes up, okay? But we're not gonna die here. I can't believe Ryan's gone. Me, either. You know, he was so excited for you. He was so happy you were finally going to get outta here and do something for yourself for a change. He thought that might make Tommy think about doing the same. You know? I just can't believe this is real. Do you think they got Tommy too? I don't wanna think about this. Tommy's the strongest guy I know. Look at him. I just don't think I could handle losing him, too. Why is this happening? - Stay here, Amber. - I can't, I can't. I'd rather take my chances out there. It's okay, what if they want us out in the open? Amber? I have an idea. But you need to trust me, okay? I trust you. The pasture where we buried my dad. Yeah. Meet me by the rock bluffs, okay? Okay. Run! What happened? Where's Ryan and Amber? Come on. Where's the fucking phone? I don't know. Damn it! What do we do now? Hold this. Dad's? Granddad's. Come here. Shotgun? Yeah. You need to drink some water. Thanks. We need to get you to a hospital soon. We need to get his truck. I can't walk any more, I'm gonna bleed to death. Don't talk like that. You know it's true, though. Do you think he's coming back? Yeah. He ain't done with us just yet. I'm sorry. Don't be. You're a good brother, Tommy. I hope you know how proud of you I am. We need to get that truck. I think I know how to get it. But I'm gonna need your help. Oh no, that's Amber. You ready? June, go! No, no! No! No. No. Shoot him, June! Fucking shoot him! June! Freeze! Get your hands up! Now! Get 'em up, man! Get 'em where I can see 'em or I will shoot you! Get up, I will shoot you in the fuckin' head! June, don't move! Turn around, put your hands on your head. Do it! Fucking shoot him, Luke. You all right? It's okay, June. It's okay, it's over. Is there anybody else? - No? - Everyone's gone. Everyone's gone? Tommy! No! No, no! Get back. - No! - You little bitch! Gonna leave me? Huh? Don't leave me. No! God damn it! Hey June, it's Matt. I just got your voicemail. Was hoping I could catch you this morning before you took off, but you're probably already on the road by now. So excited to see your face, baby. You, uh, travel safe and I'll be seeing you real soon. Love you. Son of a bitch.
