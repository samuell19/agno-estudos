(Woman screams) (Gasping and sobbing) (Distorted voice) "Think before you read, "for you must decide whether to be wise and leave well alone, "or surrender to the greed of curiosity "and discover a new world of knowledge that would stagger Satan himself. "Welcome, my friend." 'My name is Dr Henry Jekyll, and this is my story. 'Or should I say, confession? 'I was born in the year 1846 into a wealthy family 'and, after a privileged education, I followed my father into the antiquated world of medicine. 'I am one of the most respected and eminent of doctors, a gentleman. 'But, like many a gentleman, I have suppressed my feelings 'in order that I might take my rightful place in society. 'Nobody but me knows my true nature. 'T he public have only seen a veneer of my true self. 'L ike everybody in society, I have learned to play my part 'to perfection.' Morning, ladies and gentlemen. I am glad that you think me interesting enough to attend one of St Mary's Hospital's public lectures. Today's subject being... the human brain and emotions of man. However, if I may, I should like to divert your attentions away from the advertised programme and present to you a few new theories of my own. Let us slice away at the truth. - Are you squeamish? - No. (Man) Dr Jekyll... it has come to the board's attention that you've been lecturing on medical theories that are your own. And not the accepted medical opinions of this hospital. Is this true? - True. - Perhaps you'd explain to us the reason why. There's nothing to explain, I am merely stating a different point of view. And you don't think that dangerous? Dangerous? Why should I? You are the son of the founder of this hospital, a man of influence. The public might be unduly impressed by such... personal opinions. Or, should we say, flights of fancy? (Laughter) - There is nothing fanciful about my work. - That may be so. Nevertheless, you cannot be serious in your latest application. I cannot continue with my research without the board's consent. - You wish to apply for the use of a patient? - That's monstrous. - A human guinea pig? - I wouldn't call it that. And what would you call it, sir? I'd call it progress. I'm sorry, Dr Jekyll. From today, all funding of your research is terminated. Good afternoon, Henry. Afternoon. All done. Oome back and see me in a week's time. Thank you. Excuse me, sir. Thank you. Well? What's the matter with you? - I'm angry. - I can see that. What about? The hospital turned down my research application. You didn't think they'd agree? I wanted to be given a chance. The chance to play God? No, the chance to change people's lives, perhaps forever. And for that you'd inject some poor soul with one of your chemical concoctions? We're doctors, James, scientists. And there's a fine line to be drawn, Henry, between sanity and madness. We make ourselves look different to help us feel we are different. God has made us different, Henry. We are not base, instinctive creatures. We are noble beings. Morality is sent from a higher power. I have nothing in common with a man who beats his wife. The streets in this sad side of our city are a disgrace. Every which way we turn I am appalled by the degradation, the absolute poverty. One thing I want to make clear - when I'm elected as the parliamentary member during the forthcoming general election I vow to rid us of this "sin or starve" mentality. Look around you, gentlemen. What do we see? Women selling their bodies to eat. Ohildren steeped in squalor. Oan we continue to allow this in a civilised society? I think not. What is your name, my child? Mabel, sir. Mabel. Is this where you live? - Yes. - You hear that, gentlemen? The place she calls home. - Ned Ohandler, what are you doing? - What does it look like? I'm working. - Not on my clean table, you're not. Go elsewhere. - (Knock at door) - Good evening, Mrs Bradley. - Good evening, sir. Oome inside, Mabel. Dr Jekyll is not at home, I believe. No, sir. He's out tonight. - Where's Mr Poole? - Reading The Sporting Life, sir. Sat on the toi... - (Mrs Bradley) Ned! - (Toilet flushes) - What's the matter with him? - He's always playing daft. Sir Danvers. Oan I be of assistance? I was hoping I could be of assistance to you, Poole. - I believe you're in need of a new housemaid. - Oh, yes, sir. Good. Well... here she is. Her hands are dirty. So would yours be if you'd been on the streets. The streets? This girl needs employment if she's to better herself. We've had a talk and I believe she's trustworthy and capable of hard work. Have you ever worked in service before? - No, sir. - Poole. You'd be doing me a personal favour should you take her in. I've stated publicly that I intend to work with the homeless. (Poole) I see. If Sir Danvers finds her suitable, how can we refuse? Thank you, Poole. I'm most grateful. Do you think Lord Hedley will marry this person? I'm afraid so. I drew up their marriage contract this morning. How vulgar. Something should be done about it. But a very lucrative market for my uncle, Lady Oarew. A lawyer makes his living where he can, James. Morals don't come into it. But to marry an American girl. For money! I believe it's fashionable at the moment, my dear. They have money, we have titles. You seem rather solemn tonight, Henry. Do I? I don't mean to be. Henry's still smarting over the hospital board's decision. Are you, Henry? Your poor thing. Well, I think it quite silly. Why should they stop you? What harm is he doing, dear? I found your lecture absolutely fascinating. Didn't we, Sarah? We did, Mother. Although I didn't really understand a word of it. - I'm glad to hear it. - What precisely have they stopped you doing? They've stopped Henry from playing God. God? Is that all? They should have a word with my husband. He plays God morning, noon and night. I don't believe I'm playing God. I believe... - Please go on, Henry. - No. - It doesn't matter. - Obviously it does. Do continue. Please, tell us. Very well. I believe that inside every one of us there lie two beings. A higher and a lower self, the dark and light constantly struggling to take control. - Good and evil. - No, basic instinct. - Really. - A dual personality. - You go too far sometimes. - Are you trying to tell us that we're all the same? - What I'm saying is... - The devil lurks inside us all. Life makes us what we are. Everything we experience we become but underneath this fashionable, refined existence deep down inside we remain what we once were. We suppress our desires, we fear our natural natures. And what are we, naturally? - Animals. - Animals? Sorry, ma'am. Shall I scoop them up? No, leave them alone, girl. Go. And how is this knowledge to help us? - If I can separate our two natures... - Good and evil. ...the dark from the light, and contain them, then man would be free to live from all that is corrupting in this world. - How do you propose to do that? - With a chemical compound that, once injected, would, I hope, control the darker side of our personalities. The desire to lie, cheat, kill and murder would cease to exist forever. So that's why you requested to experiment on a willing patient. It's barbaric. God has given man free will to choose between good and evil. If science takes away that choice then it takes God out of man. - What if God doesn't exist? - (Gasps) Blasphemy. I can't agree with any of it. It's ridiculous to say that we're all the same. We don't all have criminal tendencies. And we're not all animals. You must agree, there is a world of difference between my daughter and your serving girl. A world of breeding. Good night. I'm very interested in what you said, Henry. - I may be able to help you. - Yes? I have an acquaintance on the board of the hospital asylum - he might be able to provide you with the patient that you need. If your experiments prove successful, I would expect to be publicly named as one of your sponsors. Of course. Let's keep this between ourselves. 'Sir Danvers' faith spurred me on. Although my discoveries were incomplete, 'every day I acquired a greater understanding of the elements needed 'to begin a new phase of my research - 'a human subject, 'the chance to gain a more profound insight into the duality I was attempting to control.' (Knock at door) - Water? - What's he doing, Ned? No one's allowed in the master's workroom. It's private. (Birds chirping) - What are you doing? - Nothing. I... Get out of here! Wait. Give me the key. 'My heart sank as I surveyed the pitiful outcome of my latest experiment. 'I had to go back and begin again. 'I was determined to find the answer.' (Orockery rattles) - Your hand is trembling. - You're not going to dismiss me, sir? Of course not. I may have been angry but I didn't mean to terrify you. I'd have been curious myself. But don't let me find you in there again. No, sir. How much did you see? - They looked like distortions. - Distortions? Like when you peer through a hall of distorted mirrors at the fair. They change your shape into fat, tall people. It's a laugh, usually. Oomic effect. Yes, but what was in that room this morning, it seemed... What? Evil. You believe in good and evil, Mabel? - Of course. Doesn't everybody, sir? - No. Evil is not a science. I've never heard anyone talk like you. Like at dinner the other night. - You were listening to our conversation? - Of course. I'm not deaf. But it's not the done thing, Mabel. A servant is there to serve. You don't exist. Then how did the peas get to roll out of the bowl, sir? That will be all, Mabel. Very good, sir. (Liquids bubbling) 'I continued with my experiments, 'Iocked away for days. 'I worked into the dead of night while my household slept soundly. 'I was determined to perfect the correct compound, 'a precise chemical structure, 'the exact formula for a drug 'that could separate the darker elements of consciousness. 'I would enter the very fortress of identity.' (Thunder) 'I shall never forget that fateful morning. 'It was raining the day that changed my life. 'T he creatures lay dead. At least, that is what I thought. 'But as I looked more closely, I saw they were sleeping, 'perhaps even... 'dreaming. 'A t last! The time had come to take up Sir Danvers' offer. 'I now feltjustified I could experiment on a human being.' We're to have a guest to stay, Poole. A patient from the asylum. More wine, sir? Don't worry, he's not a madman. You'II be quite safe. Mrs Bradley will be relieved to hear that, I'm sure. He agreed to help me with my experiments. - What is the patient's name, sir? - Er... Hyde. Mr Edward Hyde. 'I asked the servants to make up a comfortable room in the attic, 'away from prying eyes 'where Mr Hyde could find rest and we could work undisturbed.' It's for Dr Jekyll. Skinflint. From the asylum hospital, master. Thank you, Ned. 'T here would be no Mr Hyde staying in the house. 'No madness. Not yet. 'T he note had stated Mr Hyde was dead. 'He'd killed himself. 'Frightened to death by his own devils. 'Delusions of the mind. 'Suicide. 'I had no choice. 'W hen a moth sees a ray of light, it floats towards it.' (Thunder) (Agitated animal calls) "Where did I go, if anywhere? "What did I do, if anything?" It's no good, I can't digest a thing, Mr Poole. The master assures me Mr Hyde is quite safe. Did you see the state of his room this morning? Bedclothes strewn everywhere. I won't be able to sleep. Not with a lunatic here, he might do all sorts. - When did he arrive, Mrs Bradley? - Yesterday. - Who says? - The master says. - What does he look like? - I dread to think. Nobody's seen him, only the master. - I thought Mr Hyde was... - You thought what, Ned? Nothing. (? String quartet play Tchaikovsky: Waltz of the Flowers) Yes, but the most truthful... I hope you're not avoiding me, Dr Jekyll. - And why would I do that, Sarah? - I don't know. Perhaps I'm not interesting enough for you. Well, I think somebody here finds you very interesting. Who? You're a terrible flirt, Sarah. - Am I? - Yes. How shocking. Mr Hyde? It's disgraceful, the way he leads her on. - I don't see that myself. - Really? Then what do you see, Uncle? - I see a young man who's very jealous. - Nonsense. Oould it be... Dr Jekyll? - You're mustard, you are. - (Ohuckles) - (Door slams, dog barks) - What's that? There she goes. Off into the night again. What is she up to? (Wheels drown dialogue) My daughter's very taken with you, Henry, don't you think? - She's a lovely girl. - If a little bit flighty. Still, you have my blessing. Oh, you can't remain a bachelor forever, locked away in your laboratory. You need to get out more. Enjoy society, the family life, the established order. A man climbs the social ladder when he chooses his wife wisely. Understand? I will bear that in mind, should I ever decide to marry, sir. Good. How's your work? Any news from the hospital asylum? - I'm afraid they couldn't help me. - Why not? - I don't know. Medical ethics, I presume. - That's a pity. The election's imminent. Medical progress - good publicity, you understand. Yes, I'm afraid my experiment stopped some days ago. That's a shame. Excuse me, Henry. Lord Oarrington, a word, if I may. (Knock at door) Peace and tranquillity at last. Didn't you like the party, sir? Personally, I like a good knees-up. I hardly think you'd call a party at Sir Danvers' house a knees-up. Snobby, is it? I can't be doing with anything la-di-da. We're all the same underneath, aren't we, master? In the rude. Good night, Ned. Good night, sir. He doesn't wear much, does he? - Sorry? - Mr Hyde. Doesn't eat much either. - What do you mean? - I think you know what I mean, sir. 'Lf only I had left well alone that night. 'But I couldn't. I needed to repeat the experience. 'I had to know what happened to me the first time I took the drug. 'A scientific calling.' (Man) Henry Jekyll. Dr Henry Jekyll. (Heavy footsteps, echoing) Welcome. (Horses whinny) 'W hen a moth sees a ray of light in the dark, it floats towards it and sometimes burns.' Yes! (Bird calls) "Where did I go, if anywhere? "What did I do, if anything? "Drugged dreams, visions of lust. "What is the rational explanation? "Shadows of darkness. "I awoke from my disturbing sleep feeling dazed." 'On the surface numb 'but underneath, deep down inside, 'I felt strangely, magnificently elated. 'Newborn! ' Well, well, well. Been out again, has he? Mr Hyde? Ta. (Knock at door) Yes? May we both please have a word with you, sir? - It concerns the new housemaid. - Mabel? She's been seen leaving the house at night on numerous occasions. I see. Gentleman friend, perhaps? If so, I'm afraid she's been giving him stolen gifts. A case of cigars and a bottle of whisky. - They've been taken from the pantry. - Are you sure? I'm positive. She looks so honest. Will you speak to her, sir, or should I? You do it, Poole. Very good, sir. 'Nothing else mattered to me then, not even the truth. 'A man obsessed, I was determined to find out the cause of my strange behaviour, 'perhaps some impurity in the drug's chemical compound. 'Lf I could find out what was really happening to me while taking the drug 'I might be able to control my dark feelings and therefore contain them. 'My behaviour was justified.' - What are you doing? - Entertaining myself. - Have you gone mad? - Not me. There'II be murder if anyone finds out. - They won't. Give it back. I can do what I like now. - Who says? - The master. - Why should he say that? Never you mind. That's my secret. But then, you'd know all about them. Secrets. I haven't taken anything. - A bottle of Madeira sherry at the last count. - I'm not a thief. We've seen you scurrying into the night. - Where have you been going? - Nowhere. - Liar. - Ned, tell them. - Tell them what? - The truth. - I don't know anything. - But... Enough. If you won't confess your deceit you'II leave this house tonight. For good. (Orashing and banging) He wants curtailing, that Mr Hyde. Dr Jekyll. Henry. Shall we? When I received your note... - Nobody knows? - Not a soul. I've told nobody of our meeting. It's our secret. Secret! How romantic! What do you want? - I need to see you. - I told you, last time you came here trying to see me. I can't, it's not safe. (Man) Are you decent? See what I mean? You'd best get going. If he finds you he might get younger ideas. Three's a crowd. I've nowhere else to go. Please. I can't help you, not any more! Just forget about me. No. I'm not worth it. Are you cold? Oome a little closer. Feeling better? I'm grateful to have this time alone with you, Sarah. I hope you don't mind me talking so freely. I desire it. Your hand. It's trembling. Are you frightened? Good. What are you doing? I'm listening to your heart's desire. Your heart is beating fast. Small, tiny, tender, little... - What's wrong? - You're hurting me. The thorns of the rose, they're piercing my... Flesh? Relax. Pleasure and pain, there's little difference. Once you accept it you can accept anything. - Dr Jekyll. - Surrender to it. - Please, I... - Surrender to my lust, Sarah. - I want you. - Let go of me! Let me show you how much I want you, Sarah. Do you want that? Beg me, Sarah. Show me how much you want me. Worship me. Aaah! Dr Jekyll. Take me home. You don't remember anything, sir? Nothing at all. I presume I was returning from my surgery when someone attacked me. Did they steal anything? My wallet? It's there, sir. I don't understand. What's wrong, sir? Oome closer, Mabel. Forgive me, Mabel. Forgive me. What time is it? Half-past two. What were you doing out there in the streets? - I was visiting someone, sir. - Who? My mother. I thought you were an orphan. My mother gave me away, a long time ago. - Been searching for her. - Yourjourneys into the night. I found her working from a room. And your father? I have no father. My mother has no idea who he was. I see. Thank you, Mabel. You may go to your room. I've got no room, sir. Mr Poole's thrown me out for thieving but I haven't done anything. - I'm innocent. - I know, Mabel. I know. Go to your room. Thank you, sir. I think it's a disgrace. What's he thinking? We must do as we're told. Second chance indeed. Here, you, take this up to the madman. - Which madman? - Mr Hyde, who do you think? That's my job. The master says I'm the only one to do it. Please yourself. What's all the mystery? Nobody allowed to see him. Is he deformed or summat? - It's an abomination. - I can't believe it. Silly girl let herself out of the house - a secret rendezvous. - Did she say who? - She can't say anything. Her mother... The whole household is hysterical. Of course, nobody must know. - I don't understand. - My parliamentary campaign. I can't afford the scandal. The newspapers must never hear of this. - You'd put yourself before your daughter's? - I don't have a choice. Public men and their families must live by impeccable standards. Why are you telling me this? I have to talk to somebody, Henry, someone I can trust. You're a family friend, a doctor. Even a man in my position has to confide in someone. She was found crawling. - Her mind gone. - No. She was brutalised, beaten. No. (Raucous laughter) (Men coughing) 'I had stepped over the boundary. 'A nd once you step over the boundaries of human existence, anything can happen. 'Y et I continued in taking the drug. 'I was still convinced I would succeed 'if I could only find the drug's chemical compound and control its effects. 'Or, at least, that is what I told myself.' Haven't you forgotten something, sir? It's a long walk to collect those drugs. And it's a long walk up to his room. And every time he doesn't eat anything, I have to throw it away. What would Mrs Bradley think if should tell her? Tell her what, Ned? Mr Hyde. - What about him? - He's dead. - Dead? - Dead... ...difficult, sir, to look after I mean. And people should be paid a lot more money to put up with it. Especially as the others downstairs are talking. We wouldn't want them to know the truth, would we, sir? Mr Hyde's strange moods. Oourse not. I quite agree. For I am your protector, Ned, and you are mine. I like to think so, sir. Oome here, Ned. Take this. - What is it you want, Ned? - Nothing! - Eh? Are you sure? - Dead sure! - Dead sure? - Dead sure! Honest! Good boy. I'm glad we understand each other. Run along. (Mrs Bradley) How am I supposed to clean this? Burn it. Have you told the master? Ned? The state of Mr Hyde's room. He's not interested. He always defends Mr Hyde's behaviour. It ain't natural. What are they doing up there together? What are you insinuating, Mrs Bradley? I am insinuating nothing, Mr Poole. I'm staring at the facts. 'P leasure had become a beloved friend, no more the sense of shame. 'Exulting in the freshness of new sensation, 'temptation delighted me like new wine.' Oh, my God. Are you all right? Silence! Get up! Do you hear me? Get up! What are you doing? Put her down! - He dropped her on purpose! - What is she to you? - She's a child. - She's worthless. - What is the point of her life? - Say that again! Get your hands off me! You dogs! (Roars) (Distorted) Get him! (Echoing) Look at the sight of him. - Oall yourself a gentleman? - Is he drugged? But what have I done? - You know what you done. - Take his money! Give her some money! - Give us some money! - (All shouting) Yes, of course. Here. Please, take it. Take everything I have. They should be flogged, all of them. If I had the chance, I'd do it myself. I escaped relatively unharmed, Sir Danvers. - At least, I think so. - They're peasants. Actually, it was fascinating watching them. The way human beings change. A crowd becomes a mob in the blink of an eye. - How is she? - She's sleeping. I was hoping she'd be well enough to see you but she's frightened of everyone and everything. - Has she told you any more? - No, not a word. Perhaps it's for the best. We don't want to prolong her dreadful ordeal. No, dear. Or sabotage your carefully constructed public image. Exactly. I'd be grateful if you'd agree to medically examine her, Henry. My husband will allow no other doctor to see her. I know Sarah would like to see you when she awakes. - Yes, of course. - Good. Sarah. Oan you hear me? You have a visitor, Sarah. Wake up. Wake up and see. 'My dreams became nightmares, 'my nightmares my reality.' I live in your soul. Like a caged bird. But sometimes... the door is opened, and I fly out to greet you. 'He disappears like breath upon a mirror. 'Hallucinations.' (Ned) If that's all, sir, I'II be off. Stay where you are. I need your assistance. Sit down. Why? You are to watch me, Ned. Tell me what happens. But I know what happens, sir. It's a question of balance. If I can refine the impurity in this compound, I'II control my behaviour. Don't convince me, sir, convince yourself. Tonight will be different. This formula must work. You'II help me, Ned, won't you? Stay with me. - Write everything down. - I'm tired, sir. I'm fed up of this running about every night. I want to leave. Sir, I want to leave, for good. Tomorrow morning I want to find work somewhere else. I've had enough. Very well. - You may leave if you wish. - Really? Thank you, sir. But promise me one thing, Ned... I won't tell anyone, sir. I promise, your secret is safe with me. I won't tell anyone who you are, at times. And who am I, Ned, at times? You're... You're Mr Hyde. Yes. I am... Mr Hyde. 'I had lost control of my experiments. 'I had lost control of my life. 'I sought with tears to smother my cold terror. 'I 'd committed crimes against humanity and could not live in denial any longer. 'W hen my drugged nightmares became a reality, 'I knew I was eternally damned. 'W ho could help me now? ' Lighten our darkness, O God, I pray, and in your mercy defend me from all that is evil. Is that you, sir? Who do you think it is? I don't know, sir. Nowadays the face looks the same but the person is different. Oh, God. Forgive me. What is wrong, sir? I have sinned. I am evil. - You're not evil, sir. - Yes. (Breathing heavily) Yes... - Please forgive me. - I don't have the power to forgive evil, sir. Only God can do that. How are you so sure God exists? I feel it, sir. Inside. - Then I am truly damned. - No, sir. Everything can be forgiven. - Not everything. - Yes, everything. How? How? Tell me. With love. I feel nothing. Nothing. Thank you, Mary. - And he never said a word? - Nothing. - And all his clothes had gone? - According to the master. Oleared out his room and disappeared. Looks like we owe you an apology, my girl. - What about? - Ned, our thief. (Danvers) You may well hide your face. I have no recollection. You may choose not to remember but my daughter remembers everything. - It's not true. - Here's the proof. A letter in your own hand asking Sarah to meet you. I am a gentleman, sir. My daughter is a respectable woman. Why would she lie? - She is ill. - Oourse she's ill! Who caused her illness? You did! I would never consciously harm Sarah, believe me. I don't know what to believe. Look at you. - You look like a laudanum addict. - Yes. I'm sorry, I need to bathe. Is that all it will take to restore your reputation? I think not. People are talking, influential people. You've been seen around town indulging in disgusting behaviour. These influential people - are they friends of yours? Are you insinuating I entertain people of low moral standard? - I came here today because my daughter... - I never touched her! - How am I to believe that? - I am an honourable man. - You'II swear upon that? - If needs be. - Will these friends of yours do the same? - What are you suggesting? Should anyone have anything to say about my so-called behaviour, name them. What are these influential friends doing in such places? - I never said any of them were present. - What are you saying, Sir Danvers? Think wisely before you speak. We don't want a scandal, do we? - Scandal? - A scandal. Naming names. - No. We don't want a scandal. - Good. Pleased to hear it. I understand what you're saying. And I understand, sir, that your daughter is ill. Yes. She's ill. Oonfused. Goodbye, Jekyll. From today, we will never see each other again. The man I knew and respected no longer exists. Mirror, mirror, tell me, am I strange or vain? Or am I downright evil and evil to remain? Leave me alone! I cannot leave you! You love me. I am your own creation. 'W hat if the madmen take control? 'W hat if the sane men lose their minds? 'W here would we go? Where would we hide? 'I pacified myself. I had done no wrong. 'It was Hyde, Mr Edward Hyde, that was guilty of these terrible crimes, not I.' Not I. Not I... 'Oonvincing myself I had begun my experiments with good intent - 'the need to separate dark from light - 'I continued my work. 'Different chemicals, different formulas. 'I tried to achieve my goal, I tried to bring myself back to a rightful path. 'T his was my salvation. 'My work was for the good of all mankind 'and, one day, I would undo the evil I had done. 'I was innocent. 'A nd so was she. My helper. 'My angel in the night.' Mabel. What happened? Who did this? A gentleman caller. - (Knock at door) - You're late. - I had to see someone, sir. - Did you get it? - Hm-mm. - Good girl. - There's some money. - I don't want any payment. It's enough to know I'm helping you. I thought you might want this returned, sir. What are you doing with that? Mr Hyde left it at my mother's. Your mother's? He visits her regular, she told me so tonight. What else did your mother tell you about Mr Hyde? He's violent, sir, and pays her for the privilege. Are you sure? Will you stop him, sir? Please. I beg you. I will do everything I can, Mabel. Thank you, sir. What's he like, sir? Mr Hyde? Like... Like no one you've ever known. (Bell chimes) - (Women laughing) - 'I am in awe of him. 'W hen he's here inside me, I feel euphoric. 'I stand tall and magnificent, 'afraid of nothing. 'I need no one, just... 'myself.' I hope your evening has been a pleasant one, Sir Danvers. What do you mean, sir? I saw you leaving the house on the corner. Fun and games with the ladies, I presume. How dare you? I was there on charitable business. Fallen women. Oh, yes, I'm sure. Oharitable business. (Ohuckles) - What the hell do you think you're doing? - Kneel. - Have you lost your mind? - Oh, yes. Obey. I think not, sir. I think you will, sir. Kneel! Beg to your master. Beg for your life. What are you doing, Jekyll? I am not Jekyll. I am Hyde. Mr Edward Hyde. Don't talk nonsense. You're insane. What do you say to a game of hide and seek? - Hide and seek? - Hide for your life. Help me! Someone help me, please! Orawl. Orawl, Sir Danvers. Orawl. Orawl! Orawl. Orawl, that's it. Are you ready? Mr Hyde is coming. I'm coming. Sir Danvers, I've found you. The game is over before it's begun. You've lost, Sir Danvers. And Mr Hyde has won. Mercy! Good night, forever. Sleep tight. (Knock at door) (Door opens) - (Poole) I'm sorry, sir, you can't come in. - I insist! - He won't see anyone. - Let me pass, Poole. - He won't see anyone! - I intend to see him. Mr Utterson! - It comes as a great shock. - Indeed. Yes, to everyone, I'm sure. Society is outraged. Have they any idea who committed such a callous crime? I was hoping you might tell me. - I don't understand. - Don't you? Should I? I've spoken to the police. Sir Danvers was bludgeoned to death. A gentleman's walking cane. - What has that to do with me? - It was your father's cane. My father's? You don't think I had anything to do with this... Of course not. But I think you know who did. He's betrayed your trust, Jekyll. Abused your generosity shamefully. You must see that. - Yes. Yes. - Then where is he? You're not foolish enough to keep him hidden? Worse, Utterson. Worse. I... I helped Hyde escape. (Jekyll) He returned and begged for money. When I asked for what reason, he confessed. (Utterson) Murder? - And still you helped him? - I... I gave him what money I had. He left for the boat train. What am I to do, Utterson? Do you promise me he's gone forever? Yes, I want nothing more to do with him. I promise you, Hyde has left my life forever. Then your secret is safe, Jekyll. I'II tell no one. We are friends. We'II speak no more of your Mr Hyde. Thank you, Utterson. I am eternally grateful. How could you? He tortured my mother and murdered your friend. How could you help him? - I had no choice. - We all have a choice in life. A choice of right and wrong, good and evil. Fly. Fly. Fly away. Dr Jekyll? Dr Jekyll? Sir? What's he staring at? God alone knows. - He won't be coming to hurt you any more. - Who? - Mr Hyde. - Oh, him. Good riddance. Still, he paid me handsomely for his pleasure. You were lucky, Mother. Lucky? What do you mean? What's the matter? I knew him. For years he's visited me here without fail. He looked after me, brought me presents. When he saw you in the streets... it was no coincidence that he found you work. Who? Your father. Sir Danvers Oarew. You've a half sister, Mabel, he's told me all about her. Beautiful lady, of breeding. What do you want with me? You brought me here by your own actions. (Jekyll) I beg you to leave me alone. (Hyde) I told you, I cannot leave you. You are me, I am you. Two separate identities struggling to take control. Oontrol of what? The mind, body... and soul - of a man. - Which man? This man! Who's he talking to? Himself. - Lock yourself away upstairs. - Where are you going? Go. Go! Touch me. (Jekyll) Help me! Oh, God, help me. - Dr Jekyll? - Mabel. Dr Jekyll. Go away, please. Please. Do you hear me? Leave me alone! Very well. 'I will make you leave.' How? 'T he mind controls the body.' But who controls the mind? Give yourself to me, Jekyll. Surrender your soul to me. Forever. Sir? He's devouring me. At first I was the stronger but now, bit by bit, he grows inside me. A parasite. Soon I won't exist. I won't exist. - Fetch my medicine bag. - Why, sir? - I mean to poison him. - Poison who? Murder me and you murder yourself. 'I looked upon that abomination in the glass, the lethal side of man, 'and I felt... 'mesmerised.' (Mabel) Let me help you, sir. Why do you want to help me? I'm beyond help, beyond forgiveness. Nobody's beyond forgiveness. I told you that once, remember? I've committed the most evil crimes. I'm a monster. You're not a monster, sir. You're a man who's lost his way. Yes, yes... Oh, God, yes. I've lost my way. Take my hand, sir. 'W hen I wore the semblance of Mr Hyde, nobody dared to touch me. 'Except her.' Nooooo! (Hyde's yell echoes and fades) Oome, sir. Let me help you to your room. What would I do without you, Mabel? What would I have done without you, sir? Let us be one. Forever! A few more steps, sir. Love me. - I'm frightened, Mabel. - Frightened of what, sir? - I'm frightened. - There's nobody else here. I'm frightened of myself. Mr Hyde. Mr Hyde? Yes, he was a bad man. I... helped him become that man. But you helped me too, sir. You took me back into your home, helped me when nobody else would. One drop of goodness outlives a world of evil. You've treated me with kindness, and for that I... I love you. (Echoing) Welcome. 'Evil had finally destroyed the balance of my soul. 'T he child of hell is nothing human. 'Nothing lives in him 'but fear and hatred. 'R aging with the passion of Hyde, my soul is boiling. 'Oaged in my flesh, he fights back. 'He fears my power to cut him apart. 'Suicide. 'T his is the last time. 'I cannot find it in my heart 'to pity him. 'T he doom that is closing in on us both has already changed and crushed him.' (Growls) 'A s I write, he fights with me. 'But I will destroy forever the evil that sleeps within me.' (Distorted, echoing voices) 'O God, 'let me wake in a different world. 'O God. 'L et Hyde find the courage to release himself at last. 'T his is the true horror of my death. 'I pray for serenity and peace. 'Everlasting bliss, 'everlasting life. 'I repent. 'R elease me from damnation. 'O God... 'O God, forgive me. 'I am released. 'My soul is released.' May God have mercy on him. PAL English SDH
