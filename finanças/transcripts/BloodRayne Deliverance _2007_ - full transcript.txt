(slow western music) - Finished? - Dad, can you read us a story? - Why don't you go pick one out? Dad will be in in five minutes. - Okay. (solemn music) - It's late in the season for this much snow. - That snows gonna turn to mud. It's gonna gut down the city. (laughter) It'll be June before we can start planting. - We'll make due. We always find a way. (horse naying) - Goddamn bears back. - Be careful. - We're gonna figure this out. (wind swooshing) - What was that? - Vince? You two stay put. Vince? (door shuts) (wind swooshing) - Hurry, get under the bed. Get under. (foot steps) (springs creaking) - Are you sad children? Do you miss your mother and father already? Don't worry, you'll join them soon enough. - No, no, no! Let go of me! Help! - Sheriff, if you and Sadie wanna spend the night, I got a free bed for you. - I appreciate the offer, but my lady, Sadie, here prefers her own bed at night. - Alright. - Bid you good night. - Easy. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Won't you go on and check on the little ones out. I'll finish up down here, okay? Alright. Goodnight. - Evening. - Alright Merritt. - Night Sheriff. - Cash in your chips a little early, leaving tomorrow? - Look, Mayor, if I don't find the wild in the west soon, the papers gonna cut me loose. - Yeah, Deliverance is about the quietest town on the frontier. - That's an understatement. - When that rail service comes in next week, there'll be a whole lot more going on. - I can't wait that long. (eerie music) (knocking) - You better be sleeping. What's wrong? - We saw somebody outside. - What? (screaming) - Uh! (screaming) - Please, don't hurt my children. I'll do anything. Anything! (talking drown out by screaming) - That's far enough! This here is a good town. And I'm the law here, young fella. - Get your hands off me! - Now, you let those children go this damned instant. You let the children go. Now, you drop those guns. I said drop them! (gun shots) (screaming and grunting) - I am Franklin Pope, mayor of... My house is at your disposal. - Excuse me sir, my name is Newton Biles. I'm with the Chicago Chronicle. I write stories about the west. - Tell me, Mr. Biles, is telling stories your reason to live? - Yes. - Then bear witness to the greatest story ever told. (solemn chiming) (upbeat western music) - Bernadette? Vince? (horse naying) William! (mysterious chiming) You better have something interesting to say, Mister. - Easy now, the youngins ain't here. - I can see that. Where are they? - My guess is they're with Billy The Kid and his gang. Never seen em take prisoners before though. - That ain't the work of no bandits. - Billy The Kid, he ain't no bandit. He ain't even human. He's some sort of creature, creature of the night. You mind putting that pig sticker away? Please. Look. Easy. He's been real busy. These folk, they kin to you? - As close as it gets for me. Where did he bring those children? - If they're alive, I'm betting they're in Deliverance. - Seeing how you and I have similar interest here, maybe you and I should think about teaming up. - I ride alone. - Hey, there's gonna be an awful lot of those blood suckers. A woman alone won't be able to handle it by herself. - Your fly's open. (horses galloping) (slow intense music) - Hold up there, Missy. You discharge a single round from your weapons in my town, you, me, and Sadie, here be having ourselves a conversation. Now, if you're a pretty lady looking for some work, we got ourselves some nice business folk who pass through here, and the railroad lines coming soon. - Might wanna get a pretty dress, have yourself a bath, and do your hair up real nice like. - You talk to Martha over at the pig, she'll point you in the right direction. - And I might even drop in and pay you a visit myself. - Keep an eye on her. - With pleasure. I think I'm going to enjoy this. - Hey, hey, hey. I'm telling ya I'd been chasing that son of a bitch for six months and there he was. I sees him clear as day. Hey, hey, hey, thank you. Go on, sweet thing, go on! Anyway, I sees him clear as day. And I said I don't care who thinks this cock sucker is as dangerous as folks say he is. I don't care nothing about how many men they say he's shot. The only thing I plum care about is where I got my gun aimed. Both barrels aimed right at him I had. Then I tells him, when you see the devil, you tell him Flintlock Hogan sent ya. (gun shot) (laughter) I shot that cock sucker good. Now he closer to the devil himself. - Bravo! Bravo! (foot steps) - Eww wee! Only two things a woman is good for, making my grub and keeping my dick warm. (laughter) - You say the sweetest things. - Oh there's plenty of sweet stuff where that came from, Honey. (grunting) - Flintlock Hogan. - You're crushing my windpipe. - You reckon I'd give up looking for you? - Last time I saw you, you interrupted a good game. How about you let me finish this time? We can even deal ya in. We don't mind taking your money. Oh come on, baby. What you say, huh? Come on. - I'll take that. (distant chatter) - I must have a four leaf clover shoved right up my arse. You all may as well fold now and count your losses. Otherwise, Irish Mick is gonna send you all home crying to your mommas. - [Hogan] Come on, Mick, just play your fucking cards. - Patience is a virtue Mr. Hogan. Full fucking house. (laughter) - What you got? - I got that beat. Four aces. - Jesus, look at that. - You can add that to your list of what a woman is good for. - Cock sucking, cheating bitch! - Come on! - Ain't it like an Irishman to bring a bottle to a gun fight? - I should have known this shit. - Back down, Kentucky. It's between me and the little cunt. Let's go, Rayne. Let's settle this outside. Let's go, Rayne! I'm done messing around witcha. Come on! - [Bystander] Go get the Sheriff pronto. - [Hogan] That's more like it. - Miss, you don't know what you're dealing with. (growling) - That's fair, 'cause neither do they. - Oh, Rayne, you know I'm the best cock sucking shooter god's america ever spouted into existence. Shit, I done killed 17 men since last I saw you. And I ain't counting China-men and Indians. - What are you looking for, some sort of prize? - Prepare to meet your maker, bitch. (slow intense chiming) (gun shots) (wheezing and grunting) - What the fuck? - Bad reaction to some bullets, and some holy water, and some garlic. God bless his sole. - It's bullshit were music, you'd be a bleeding brass band. (gun shots) - I have had about enough of all this. Re-skin those pistols, gentlemen. I've got this. See this here scatter gun? I've done killed over 30 men with this little lady. Now, we've got some rules in this town. If there's one thing that Sadie don't like, it's people breaking them. The boss don't like em much, neither. Prepare the gallows! We're having ourselves a hanging. You've got til high midnight to make your peace and think about what you've done here. (fighting) Told you not to piss Sadie off. - [Mayor] Perhaps you could put in a good word for her. - Ma'am? Ma'am? I'm over here. Hi, bravo, bravo. I'm Newton Biles. I'm with the Chicago Chronicle. I'm here writing stories for the east coast, true tales of the new frontier straight from the line. The tales of blood. I was just wondering if I could interview you, you know, for the folks back at home. - Who's the boss holed up at the end of the street? - The fellow sent me to find out who you are. I had no choice. - Billy The Kid? He got any kids with him? What's he up to? - Ma'am I really couldn't tell you. - Can't or won't? - He doesn't share his plans with me. I write what he wants me to write, and I do what he wants me to do. - He's growing an army. Why are you so interested in him anyway, lady? Seems to me, you got your own problems right now. - Got my reasons. - Such as? - Reasons of my own. - Oh God. - What are we gonna do about this little snitch? You won't be taking any of this back. - Yes, that's right. Oh! - You're a Brimstone. - That mean something to you? - Around the neck. Names Rayne. I'd shake your hand but... - I understand. I'm Moen. - I take it you're not here by accident. - I'm been tracking Billy clear from Cheyenne. Something wasn't quite right about him. - How's he like his gun fighter? - Truth be told, he's not much of a hand with a gun. He don't need to be. He can take bullets like a boxer takes punches. - Are you saying he heals himself? - It's the damnedest thing. He don't even need to feed on blood to heal himself. He must be one old vampire, strongest I've ever seen. He's smart, too. He's got leadership abilities. Hell, I admire the son of a bitch. Let's see if we can get more comfortable here. I'll get these. Let me see your glasses. - Be careful, I just bought those! - What's this about building up an army? - I saw that he was coming in, attacking the homesteads, collecting new recruits out of men unless they put up too much of a fight. Left the women and kids dead. - How many men'd he turn? - I figure he's got 30 vampire cowboys, I reckon. - Um, excuse me, turn them? - If a vampire bites a man, he'll turn into a vampire himself unless they rip his throat out in the process. Wasn't until they took over this town, that we saw what he was doing. Do you mind? You're in my light. - Who's we? - Me and my partner. He was a brimstone. He rode off to get some others, his head come back in a mail bag. I don't know how they knew. They got me on account of being his partner. - You ever figure out what they were up to? - The railroad's coming to town next week, right? - Of course! As soon as the rail service comes to this outpost, hundreds of people will be coming in. - And going out vampires. I figure start here and build his army, and then he'll go out west, growing stronger as he goes. - Until the rail service begins, he needs to keep things looking normal so that's why he took all those kids hostage. - That's so they'll have something to feed on while they wait. - Hey. They're almost finished setting up the gallows. - It looks like it's the end of the line for us. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, aren't you gonna put up a fight? - What do you propose we do, newspaper man? You gonna help us? - I'm flattered, but I'm more of an observer. - A man who hangs in the shadows and does nothing is the worst kind of man. Isn't that right, Rayne? - Enough, both of you! If we're gonna do something, we gotta do it now. - What do you want me to do? - You got any weapons? - I got your swords. These drunk cowboys traded them to me for a bottle of whiskey. - I'm an objective party. - You're Billy's lap dog. - Folks out there are scared to do anything. From what I can see, you're our last hope. - It's showtime! - Oh shit. - Unlock em. - What are you doing here, Bob? - I came to see if they wanted anything special for their burial. - We're gonna be dumping them in the marsh if that addresses any of your concerns. - Open it. Come on, come on, let's go. We are gonna test the gallows with you, my friend. So that you can be an example to the town's folk, sweet cheeks. (sobbing) - Eenie, meanie, mini, moe. Come. (screaming) Watch. Shhhh. Hush little baby don't say a word, man is going to buy you a mockingbird. And if that mockingbird don't sing. (screaming) So pretty. So pretty. - Come on boy. Hold still, hold still. All right everybody, quiet! Any last words? - Y'all better pray we never meet again. - No much chance of that. Hang 'em! (laughter) Go get the meanest match. - Come on. - Sheriff, what do you need me here for? - 'Cause Mr. Mayor, you are the face of this town. And as the face of this town, it's only proper that you be involved in the handing out of justice. Because it gives me a hard on to see you shittin' your pants. (intense electric music) - Who's ready for another hanging? I think you should do the honors. Read! - For the crime of. - Speak up god dammit! Don't be shy! - For the crime of causing a ruckus, assaulting officers of the law, and murdering on file for three counts. - William. - Get on with it, let's hand the bitch! - I declare you should be hung by the neck until dead. Dead. Dead. - Well said, get on with this. - Rayne! - Is this a friend of yours? - What the hell? - Son of a bitch. - Rayne! - You will not disa... (gunshots) - Very brave bartender. - What do you want? - Your life. (gunshot) Come. - [Man] She's gotta be around here somewhere! Come on! - Looks like you could use a friend. Come on, just take a little bit, little bit. There you go. You sure don't make friends easy, do you? I saw you kill three of those suckers last night. Not bad for a nights work. - Still a ways to go. - Yeah, well you're not going anywhere today or tonight or next week for that matter. - It's too long. - Woman you're lucky to be breathing. You got hit a couple times when you were in the water. - My blood. - Yeah, you lost a lot. - No, I need blood. - What? - Blood will help me heal. - You're a vampire? What kind of vampire can walk around in daylight and cross through water? - Don't fear. - I didn't know such a thing was possible. So what does that mean, you're mom? - Raped. By a vampire. Animal blood works, but human blood is better. - How much do you need? - As much. - There you go, there you go. That's it, that's it. Enough, enough, enough. God damn woman. - You could have put it in a cup. - Yeah, maybe next time we'll put it in a cup. (horses galloping) Rayne, I picked these up in Deliverance. - [Rayne] Thanks. - Try to hang on to 'em next time. Well that looks a lot better. You know, I think we're gonna need some help. A couple extra guns would be pretty handy you know? - Yeah, you got any in mind? - Yep, I do. Come on, Joe, this way. Back it up. That a boy. (soft western music) - Let me guess, God? - Not exactly. - [Rayne] Friend of yours? - Not yet. - Your soul seems to shake by his goodness. Or you will end up in the burning fires of hell. Oh, I hear those voices. Those sickly, perverted voices. Their whispers and mock. But those are the flapping, wagging curse. Let fear grip you, let it grip you by your intestines and pull you kicking and screaming to the light for fear is the way of the lord, our savior. Fear is what will keep the darkness from your door. The darkness that tempts and seeks to lure the righteous from the pathway to paradise. Paradise be not the sweet nectar found in the bottom of a bottle. Paradise be not the moist swollen lips between a virgin's thighs. No! Paradise be the opening of your filthy hearts and your simple minds to the glory of our lord and savior. Repent, I tell thee! Repent your filthy heathen ways or condemn yourself to damnation and sodomy in the cruel fires of hell. Now I bring you salvation, right there. And I bring you forgiveness, right there. Yes, together there is still time for that. You should know, that forgiveness does not come cheap. That's right. That's right, that's right! Donate all that you have to god and his glorious heavenly kingdom. It is the only way to be sure of your space in paradise when the end is upon you. Thank you very much, pass it around. Now there you go, see. Was it so hard to repent? (whistling) (clapping) - I don't know whether to laugh or cry. The way I see it you got three options. One, we put them wanted posters up and let the town's folk fit you with the rope. Or two, we spare them the trouble and hang you ourselves. Or three, you join us in our good works and redeem yourself. What will it be? - Well what kind of good work we talking about there, my lady? - Riding the world of all the heathen vampire scum. - Hell, why didn't you just say so? No one's gonna hand a fellow for taking money, right? Yeah. I got time to get my hat? All right, let's go. - That was easy. - Thank you, Jesus. (upbeat music) - You boys better wait out here. We don't wanna get our men over excited about all the company. - I think he's gonna be excited enough to see you. - Rayne, you watch yourself in there. This is a hard character you're dealing with. - Now why else would I wanna be soliciting his company? - Where the hell you going? - I'm going inside, you coming? - Na, I don't have any money. - Here, my treat. - Thank you, Jesus. - [Man] Hurry up with that whiskey, would you woman? Get in here! Whiskey! - Is there friends outside? - Yeah, I think so. - In the name of the lord I'm here to exercise my demons. Yeah, come on, I'll let you touch my bible. - Now howdy. - Wow, you one of Hannah's girls? - Maybe. (laughter) - Look at you! I don't know where to start, the top or the bottom. Lord. I'm gonna give you the ride of your life. Oh! You're one of those, are you? Well, all right! I'm one of those too. - I bet you are. - I can't move. - That's the point. - Ha ha, that's good. - Now, I have a proposition for you. Listen close, you don't wanna blow this. - Did I kill one of your friends or one of your kin? - Neither. We want you to kill for us. - Who? - More like what. - What? - Vampires. You with us? (laughter) - Yeah! Are you still gonna fuck me? - [Woman] Oh preacher! - [Preacher] Hallelujah. (upbeat western music) - Got something here, gonna be real helpful. - An offering. - No, no. Silver bullets rubbed with garlic. Tools of my trade. - [Preacher] Nice. - A man after my own heart. - Preacher, we need a blessing. - Well shit, yeah, I'd be honored. Dear Lord in heaven, we're gathered here on this eve, with our souls laid bear. We ask you God, give us mercy when the time for sacrifice falls upon us. - They've roamed the earth for thousands of years, feeding on a meek, then impoverished. They've forsaken God, and God has forsaken their victims. For the people of Deliverance, mothers, fathers, daughters, sons, it is for them that we do this. In dark, bonded, as brothers are we. By this we solemnly swear, for there are none but us who care. As one we stand together, we fight together, and we die together. - Thanks. - Franklin, please. There must be something we can do. My children are out there. - Martha, the devil leaves haste. It is my belief that Billy is simply using our children in order to patrol us. Were any harm to befall them, he would not have the same leverage over our decisions. He's gonna wait til the railroad comes through and take as many lives as he can, he's blood lust. However, if someone were to tell him that the railroad is no longer traveling through our fair village, he would leave. Now if God saves my soul, I would tell him that lie. I will party with him, I am confident he will prevail. - We just sit here? - Until the time is right. - It's a bad idea. (horses trotting) (mysterious music) - Look, she's back. And she's brought help. (clock chiming) - Billy The Kid! The brimstone is calling you out! - And the burning fires of hell reign down upon them. (gunshot) (laughter) - Come on out you coward! (gunshots) (grunting) (gunshots) - So hey, how come they call you slim bag? - They call me slim bag? - Yeah, let's go. What, you gonna go in there? - I'm going out there. - Martha, I do believe Mary and Sally are better off with a mother who's alive not six feet under. (sobbing) (shrieking) (grunting) (laughter) - No, no. - You seem to have your hands full. - I think we should go out there. We should go out. What's a matter with you people? You're a bunch of cowards! Those men are out there. They're putting their lives on the line for you people. For you, and your children, and all you can do is just stand here? That's why Billy has control of Deliverance, because this town is filled with a bunch of. - Mr. Biles, you know how to use that? What are you waiting for? To be slaughtered like cattle in an abituare so this demon spawn can drain you? (grunting) - Ripened on the vine, and ready to pluck. - You don't want them Billy, you want me. Pick on somebody your own size. (heavy solemn music) Billy The Kid, bullying the other little kids, huh? - Let go, Rayne. Release. Then perhaps, we can share a meal together. Taste sweet, young blood on your lips again. - You don't wanna fuck with me, Billy. - Your children are out there. There may not be much future for this town, but there's no future at all without children. Aaron, two boys. Percy, got a little girl, don't you? Well then, with me? (heavy western music) - Where the fuck'd he go? (guns cocking) - Jesus, fuck Christ. - Drop those gun belts real slow like. - You shouldn't smoke. - You shouldn't cuss. - You're out manned, and out gunned, you dirty dog bastards. - Yeah, well let's even up those odds then. - Your men are dead. This town, my country, is almost dry. But, in a few days the railroad will come opening the rest of the country to my grasp. I shall begin an army, in which will spread along these train tracks like the blood in the iron veins of this land, til nothing stands before my will. Embrace what you are, join me, rule at my side. - Get your hands off of me. (suspenseful music) - Yeah? - Yeah. (laughter) - Turn around you yellow dog bastard! (gunshots) - Well Mr. Biles, I'd like to show you the main street of Deliverance. - Hear me sinners, you will be dead before the night is done. - You are no longer welcome in Deliverance. (gunshots) (praying in foreign language) - Oh God, did you see that? Did you see that? I can't do this by myself! (shrieking) - Preacher! - William run! - Come on guys. (grunting) - No guns, I want to feel skin. Now, we play. (suspenseful music) - You're all done, preacher. You should not have done that. Suck lead. (gunshots) (grunting and screaming) - I offered you greatness. I offered you history at my side. And you threw it all away for these animals, these sheep! Is this your Shepard? Ah, my little flock. Is this the one who has made your pure hearts boil with hope and good. The taste of dispare is so much sweeter when torn from the cradle. You wait while I took your children. (laughter) Now you will watch as a drain them, weep as they die, and curse your god as they rise form the dead to rip open your throats at my command. Now, does the slaughter begin. - Billy! Let's do something about that nasty laugh of yours. (screaming and grunting) - Back up! - Big speech, small guns, you over compensating for something? - I'm sick of your half breed mouth, goodbye. (gunshots) (wheezing and gasping) (conquering music) - [Martha] Mary! - Mommy! - Mary! Oh Mary! - Mom! - Let me see, are you all right? - Mommy, Sally didn't make it. - I know, sweetheart. I know. (tranquil music) - Damn, what a story! What a story! True tale of how the west was won. What do you think, Mr. Garrett, it's got an entry, it's got sequence. - You know, I thought you had a new job? Sheriff isn't it? - Yeah, I'm the Sheriff now. - So what's next. - Riding on to Tombstone. Heard they got themselves some trouble with some vampires by the name of the Clan Gang. - Yeah I heard about that. White Herb's after them. Maybe I'll ride along. Newton, life is like a penis. When it's hard, you get screwed. When it's soft, you can't beat it. - [Newton] I gotta write that down. (intense western music)
