Presents in cooperation with with support from a film by Petter Naess Inspired by actual events In the winter 1940 it was a race between Britain and Germany to conquer Norway. The object was to gain control of the iron ore export from Norwegian harbors. German bombers and British fighter planes had skirmishes. Grotli, Norway, April 27, 1940 Is anybody hurt? Strunk? - No. - Schwartz? I've been hit in the elbow. Hauk? Hauk? Hauk is dead. Strunk, see to Josef's wound. It needs to be disinfected and dressed. Right, I'll work out where to go from here. I'm not going to die, am I? You've been hit in the elbow, Obergefreiter. The elbow. Ready? Why did he fly on? We all told him to turn back. Forget about it. There's no point in dwelling on it. Lieutenant? Lieutenant?! Lieutenant! - Schopis! - I'm down here! Underneath the snow! What happened? I fell through the snow, that's what happened. Excellent. Josef, your book. What else do you have? I waited for six hours on Berlin Alexanderplatz. Finally Hitler passed by. It's his signature. Biscuits, chocolate, sausage, sauerkraut and beer. - Beer? - Yes. Well, you never know. You're right. What are we going to do now? We march to the coast, find our army and go back to war. Officer Hauk fell for the Fatherland. "In the hour of need, some people rise up to become heroes... "steeled by quiet determination, calm deliberation and contempt for death." "When the punch of destiny brings a man to his knees, while others are elevated... "by honor and dignity." It's as if Hitler is speaking to me. - To us. - Mmm. Don't you see? We were one against three, and we survived. We shot down one of them. It's minus 20Â°, and we aren't freezing. Turn off the light. We need the batteries. We can't go anywhere in this weather. Strunk! Strunk! The sled is too heavy! Loosen your straps! - What about the food? - I said loosen your straps! Shh. Oats. Do we have water? Strunk, light the stove, will you? Norwegians seem to be a meticulous people. - Damn. - What? Only two. Shh! Do you hear that? Ahhh! This fucking bites. I hereby declare this shithole part of the German Reich. Stop! Who's there? Stop! Stay where you are! I beg your pardon? English. Who are you? A British officer and his airman. What are you doing here? Our aircraft was shot down about two miles from here. And who might you be? We are German pilots. We've been shot down too. Well, uh... come in. Lieutenant? Thank you. I don't suppose there's any chance of a spot of tea. Lieutenant Horst Schopis. Feldwebel Wolfgang Strunk. Obergefreiter Josef Schwartz. Right. Well, my name's Captain Davenport and this is my gunner Smith. Where did you spend the night? In the plane. And you? In a snow cave. A hunting cabin I presume. Room for everyone. - Why don't Smith and I sleep over here? - No. - Those are our beds. - Your beds? Yes. We've all just arrived here. How can they be your beds? - It is best you sleep over there. - Why? Listen, we were friendly. - We invited you in. - Indeed you did. But this is a Norwegian cabin. Who do you imagine the owners would want to share with? You or me? If we are in a German-occupied country, it will be me. And sooner or later this will be a part of Germany. Now go over there and sit. I'm a British officer and I have no intention of taking orders from you. It is 5:00 and you're now officially prisoners of the Third Reich. I order you to go over there. Fuck the Third Reich. Shut up! Never say that again! These are exceptional circumstances, Lieutenant. We need to work together. We will work together, Captain. But you will be our prisoners. Lieutenant, shouldn't we shoot them? No. English please. Why not? - We are not savages, Schwartz! - English please. - Quiet. - But they will kill us, if they get the chance. I'm sure of it. Go ahead then. - You want me to shoot them? - Yes. You have my permission. Go on. You gonna shoot me? But they could be useful as hostages. We could use them to make a false trail in the snow when we leave. I should let them live, then? Yes. I think that would be best. You ought to be holding a rattle, Sunny Jim... not a gun. Hands on the bed. I'm not asking, gentlemen. Hands on the bed. We're unarmed. Un-armed! Very nice. We put this by oven. I'll have that back if you don't mind. We take care of the fire, we keep the lighter. That was a present from my father on my 15th birthday. - He gave it to me for good luck. - Good luck, Captain. Look around. When we leave, I will give you back the lighter. You have my word. No, I keep the lighter and whenever you need it, you come to me. I'm not going anywhere. Why are you making problems on such a little thing? It's not a little thing, and as far as I can see you're the one making the problem. Bloody Germans! Back! Quiet! I want to make a few things clear. You are prisoners of war. And you will stay with us in this cabin until the weather improves. Tomorrow we will go to the sea and from there you will be taken to a prison camp. - Is that clear? - I think he's made himself perfectly clear, don't you, Smith? Short but to the point, sir. This is the British side, and this is the German side. You will ask permission every time you want to leave the British side. If not, we will shoot you. Is that understood? Yes. Well, in that case, in accordance with the Geneva Convention I believe we're entitled to a bed, three meals a day and sporting facilities. Do not worry, you will be treated fairly. I'd hardly call your policy of sharing "fair." Under the circumstances, many would say putting a bullet in your head is fair. You get the same food we get. Bed and shelter? You get the same shelter we get. And for sporting facilities... may I introduce you to the beautiful Norwegian countryside? Any questions? Where's the toilet? Toilet is out there and then left. Here... toilet paper. That's not toilet paper. Smaller pieces. Annoy them any way you can, Smith. Provoke them. Make them feel stressed and insecure. - Got that? - Yes sir. Strunk will go with you. And bring back more firewood. What's your name again? Me Smith. One more time. Me Smith. You? - What's your name?! - Strunk. So... Skunk. How do you like Norway? Didn't think so. Me neither. Is it true you Krauts eat nothing but sausages? Hey, Skunkie, how come you're not cold? Maybe you're too fucking stupid to feel the cold. Fuck. Is everything under control? Yeah. Help him. Go! I have to change the bandage. Strunk. The big bloke don't speak a word of English. You don't speak German either, Smith. - Whose side are you on, sir? - Shh. - Is it bad? - No, no. I need to clean the wound. - Oof, nasty wound. - Strunk! - Air it or it will get infect... - You're not to cross that line unless I give you permission. Whatever you say. Don't be afraid. Just trying to help. I'm a British officer in His Majesty's Royal Marines and Smith here is my airman. We refuse to eat off the floor. Why make a problem out of this? Listen. We want to eat at the table... like you. Is that a problem? No. Not at all. Take a seat, sir. Thank you, Smith. Well... enjoy. It's good. This? Are you fucking joking? - Makes strong. - You eat it then, mate. German soldier can march for days on this. Is that right? Germans don't need much. - No. - Then how come you invaded Poland? - Wasn't Germany enough? - Shut up! Schwartz! And you, go to your bed. - Now you want it? - No. But I don't want the little Nazi to have it either. You should teach your airman some manners and discipline. That's none of your business, sir. Captain Davenport... you're right. This is none of my business. Besides... maybe my observer was simply following my orders. Why can't we sit and talk like civilized people? Just talk. A conversation? About what? Anything. Okay. What about politics? Not a good idea. Uh... cars? Yeah. Germany is known to build the best cars in the world. Well, certainly the most boring cars in the world. British cars have elegance and style. Yeah, but they break down all the time. So what? Would you marry a woman because she was reliable and always served dinner at 7:00? Well, I wouldn't hold that against her. But where would that leave sensuality and adventure? Without the unexpected people become bored. How do you Germans feel about Jesse Owens? The black fellow who beat the shit out of your best man at the Olympics? He was a great athlete and deserved to win. For God's sake, guys! We're stuck in this shithole talking about petty matters, when all we want to do is get the hell out of here and back to our girls. Right? What? You do have girls in Germany, don't you? Tonight I was supposed to be on a date with Sheila. The new bartender back at the airbase. Blue eyes, flaming red hair and a figure that would give a fellow a crooked neck. They've all tried their luck, but not on your life. - But you had your luck with her? - Indeed. I won her. Well, actually she won me. See, I'm the local darts champion three times in a row. Then Sheila turns up, and while pouring me a pint, she says to me, "Smith, I like you and if you can beat me at darts tonight, I'm yours." And, um, did you beat her? She beat me three times in a row. Fair and square. Then the day before we left, she slides this little piece of paper across the counter. Just like that. What did the note say? "I can't wait for your game to improve." Come and see me "as soon as you get back. Love, Sheila." But then you shot us down. What about the big lug over there? Who's the woman in his life? Strunk has a family. Three kids and a lovely wife. Does he ever speak to her? Sergeant Strunk makes his family very proud of him. He works for the family business. 2,000 workers, and then he even volunteered for the German Luftwaffe. Why did he volunteer? To serve his country. And Hitler Junior, who's the love of your life? Your mother? His mother is dead. Well, what about you? Have you got a woman waiting for you? - Haven't we all? - I certainly have. And talking about women, time for washing the dishes now. - You and Smith will do it. - You didn't answer. I did. You will do the dishes now. Well, I'm afraid we can't. Why not? The kitchen is on the German side. Your compass, it contains alcohol. It might kill the infection. Didn't they teach you anything in the German Luftwaffe? Of course, but then we would have no compass, Davenport. Our position is 280 degrees, 0 minutes and 33 seconds. - Which brings us... - Four kilometers... Busy planning our trip tomorrow? Yes. I think you'll find that west is that way. No, that way. You should have checked your compass before you smashed it. West is in that direction and I can prove it. Your scarf, is it silk? Of course it is. May I borrow it? Permission to cross the border? The silk makes a needle magnetic. Well, Lieutenant, you were right. Nice little compass. Basic knowledge in the German Luftwaffe. I need to take a piss. Aw, come on. Where would I run to? You're not going to win this war, mate. What the fuck are in the sausages you eat? Anti-freeze? You win the pissing contest, Strunk. Congratulations. Strunk. Strunk... Look. He's in a bad state. No. No, no, no... - Josef... shh shh shh. - No, no ! No, no. I dreamt the British were eating me. They laughed as they ate me. - They're asleep. - I don't trust them. You don't have to. We're armed. We bomb British ships and shoot down British planes. Why can't we shoot them now? They'll be more valuable as hostages. Lieutenant? Where is your gun? In my hand. Time to get up. We leave in half an hour. No, we'd rather stay here if you don't mind. Do you need a mirror? Why not? But I take the razor after. We are somewhere here. We will go up this way. - Across the mountain. - Have you seen the weather? For God's sake, man, this is untamed wilderness. Captain, we are out of food and there's hardly any wood left. - We leave now. - Lieutenant. I have a suggestion. Why don't we go our separate ways? - No. - Why not? There are rules of war. Yes, why are you Germans so obsessed with rules and regulations? You will never understand. That is why Germany is great and the British Empire is crumbling. Crumbling, nonsense. The Empire is doing fine. Fine? Wake up, Captain. Walk! This way. Strunk, I can't go on. Lieutenant! Stop! Strunk! Lieutenant! - Follow the track. - Lieutenant! Over here! We must go back. Go back to the cabin. Let's face it. We are all going to die here. Lieutenant, why didn't we turn back? I don't understand. All the other aircraft... - Enough, Obergefreiter! - We should've gone back. - Why didn't we? - We had orders. I made a decision. - But... - There's nothing more to say! How on earth do you expect us to survive? We have the beds, supports. We can take it from the floor and the walls. You! Help him. I know what we can eat. Are we seriously going to eat moss? It's tasty and full of vitamins. Food rule number one: If it's full of vitamins, it tastes like shit. Mmm. It's good. Not bad. A steak would be nice. We could try hunting. - You don't like soup either. - I said the soup was okay, you stupid sod. All I am saying now is it would be nice with a steak. I suppose old Adolf's a vegetarian too? - I'm not a vegetarian. - Then how come you're so stupid? Stop! So, Smith, are you really a champion dart player? - Too bloody right. - No, he's not. Okay, give me three bullets, you stuffed marching penguin, I'll prove it to you. Stand up. Do as he says, Schwartz. Now point at one of Josef's buttons. What? Point at one of Josef's buttons. This one. Don't move. You were lucky. Don't move. You cannot do this three times. You were right, Lieutenant. You did that on purpose! You should've seen your expression. Not to put a too fine a word on it, but your soup has given me the runs. - What? - Permission to shit? I need to use the toilet. - Very good, Smith. - Thank you. Captain Davenport. Thank you. Reindeer. Reindeer, come and shoot them. Reindeer. Reindeer, come and shoot them! Fuck. Fucking hell! 10 or 15 reindeer right outside the fucking cabin. I know, they've gone now. Fuck. Hey, Josef. I have to say, chapter two was a little rough on my ass. Bloody idiot, you've done it now. - I'll kill you! - Stand back! - Out of the way! - Josef! Give me the gun. Out of the way. Out of the way. Put down your weapon. - You're dead! - I strongly suggest - you apologize, Smith. - Apologize for what? You're losing your mind. - Give me your gun. - He insulted the FÃ¼hrer! You are a proud German airman. The German Luftwaffe prides itself on order and discipline. Do not abandon that now, corporal. Get out of the way! You're dead! Lieutenant, your commanding officer has given you an order. You need to obey it. Now listen to your commanding officer and put down your gun. Do you really want to disobey your leader? I did not give you permission to cross that line, Captain. Weapons on the floor! Now! And slide them over there. Nice work, Smith. Right, you, over there. Are you taking us prisoners? That's right. Well, in that case, according to the Geneva Conventions - we are entitled to food... - I know, I know. Yes, you know. But do you also accept it as your responsibility? Right. It's time to change places. Please, consider Josef's condition. He'll be fine over there. All right, leave him be, but have Strunk carry all the would-be-weapons over to our side. Now. Weapons. And the axe. I've got a few questions. You lot have taken most of Europe. Not England, but most of Europe. How does that feel? I don't know. I'm just a pilot. Think harder. I feel sad. - Then why do you do it? - Orders. When do you think Hitler will be satisfied then? When he's taken China? Maybe. What the fuck does he want with China? They speak Chinese over there, for Christ's sake. I guess you're right. One last question: What makes you think you've got the right to invade everyone? Maybe we are just like you. I'm sorry, you've lost me there. England invaded the whole world exactly the same way. - We did not! - What about India? What about all your colonies? You sailed away with a gun and a Bible in your hand and took whatever you wanted. That is the whole reason we are here. - You're off your head, mate. - Am I? We are here to protect the Norwegians from you. - What? - You want the land and more important, you want what is in it. What the fuck would we want with this place? You don't know? Raw materials. Raw materials for your industry... Your ships, your planes, your bombs. That is why we both are here. History, Robert. We all want raw materials. There is nothing to eat. What will you do about it? We'll get some more moss. I'll go out and shoot a Norwegian reindeer. Satisfied? - Take Strunk with you. - Why? Because that's an order. Get up, Skunk. Get up. Here. You'll need an extra gun for hunting. Take this one too. I don't think that's a good idea. I didn't ask what you think. Just do it. This is where the reindeer were. I told you. Go on. Axe, please. Excellent. Help me. Excellent. - I told you. - Spare me your know-it-all remarks. What are you doing? Not a very sporting gesture. This is war. Not a silly game in your country club. Keep it for all I care... just help me here. Tell me, why is it so damned important for you to be in control all the time? Hmm? Because that's how it is. Am I right? Why? Look at me. Look at me! Nice shooting. - Did you just speak? - Yes. Why the hell didn't you say anything before, then? You never say anything interesting. What the devil is the matter with you? I'm a failure. - Nonsense. Keep pushing. - Yes, I am. What on earth are you talking about? - I am a lousy pilot. - Well, I'm an excellent pilot - and you shot me down. - On my first flight I made a plane crash. Three people died. I was sent three months in prison. But when the war broke out, they gave me a new chance. On the next flight I crashed into a hangar. I lost a man on this trip. And look at Josef. Please don't. I'm sorry. How come you volunteered, Strunk? I mean, you're almost 40, you earned a lot of money. - You didn't have to. - It was my duty. Oh, come on. Would you like to run a company with 2,000 men? Paper work, responsibility - and long hours. - No fucking way. Me neither. So I volunteered. And then you met me. Get going. Strunk! Quickly! Wedge the beam. Yeah. - Put the gun down! - You put the gun down. How did he get it? It's a little complicated. I am willing to lower my gun, if you do the same. And end up in a German prison camp? - No fucking thank you. - Do it, Smith. We need to work together. We forget the guns, make a cease fire and... And live like one big happy family? Trust me on this one, Smith. Right, on three. One, two, three. - Well, that's it. - Yes, when you have dropped your second gun. Do it, Smith. Right, that's that. We have to skin it, don't we? Mmm. Sir, you go hunting back home? Yes, but we have people to take care of this kind of thing. But what do you think they do? Get me a knife. Oh, come on. It can't be that hard. What? First we take the head off. Do you like cooking? I've never tried it before. Hmm. Never? No. You never helped your mother? Actually she never cooked either. But it feels good. Do you smell it? It's gangrene, I'm afraid. Are you sure? I'm sorry. Oh my God. We must amputate his arm and get him to a hospital. How do we do this? With the axe. We need to heat water. Take whatever you can use for wood... the beds, floor, whatever. Smith, get some snow. Then we disinfect the axe and then... We must stop the blood. Right. Can you help me with the jacket? Lieutenant. I've found something. It's dried meat. But why hide it there? Stop you Germans finding it. Can we have a drink now? Good idea. Ready? - Josef, Josef. - Wake up, Josef. Josef. I found some schnapps. We'll beat the British at drinking. You must help. Cheers, Josef. - Up Liverpool. - Come on, get it down. More. You have to drink more. They're winning! Drink! - Yeah! We're winning. - Aren't you drinking? Come on, Smithy. They're winning, they're winning! Drink for the FÃ¼hrer! Drink for Germany! - âª Deutschland, Deutschland... âª - âª Ãber alles âª âª Ã¼ber alles in der Welt âª âª Wenn es stets zu Schutz und Trutze âª âª BrÃ¼derlich zusammenhÃ¤lt. âª Want me to do it? Thanks. But no thanks. Did we win? Yes, we won. Everything is all right. What are you doing? What are you doing?! Do you mind? What should we do with the arm? I don't know. Get rid of it. We can't. It belongs to Josef. What would he want with it? It's bit of a pickle really. We have to do something. We could wrap something around it and bury it outside. Yes. We will bury the arm and make a small ceremony. Perhaps Josef would like to be present. Yes. Maybe it's best to... wait. Oh, for fuck's sake. Come here, you. Can we please have a drink now? Norwegian military camp near Stryn The rest are in good shape. Okay, let's talk tomorrow. Thank you. I ran into a burnt-out German plane. Here at Heilstuguvatnen. So that's where they came down. And the crew? I don't know. We will look for them at sunrise. Your turn, Smith. Tell us... - how you impressed this lovely Sheila. - Mmm. No way. Come on, hmmm? - Sheila. - Sheila, Sheila, Sheila, Sheila, Sheila, Sheila. All right. I showed her my cock and she fainted. That often happens if you're not used to wearing strong glasses. Hmm? Come on, Smith. Tell us. How did you do it? Okay, I sang to her. You sang? I got up on the bar and I sang to everyone. And that did the trick. - And what did you sing? - "Over the rainbow." I heard she loved "The Wizard of Oz." Well, I'll be damned. - And can we hear it? - Mmm. - No way. - Come on. No. - You can't sing. - Yes, I can. So come on, sing. Sing. - Sing. - Sing. Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, - sing, sing, sing. - I need a piss. No contest this time, please. - Liar. Liar! - Liar. Liar. - There you are. - Ah. Well, I could, um... - âª Somewhere over the rainbow... âª - I... âª Way up high... âª âª There's a land that I've heard of âª âª Once in a lullaby âª âª Somewhere âª âª Over the rainbow âª âª Skies are blue âª âª And the dreams... âª âª That you dare to dream âª âª Really do come true âª âª Someday I'll wish upon a star âª âª And wake up where the clouds are far behind me âª âª Where troubles melt like lemon drops âª âª Way above the chimney tops âª âª That's where you'll find me âª âª Somewhere over the rainbow âª âª Blue birds fly âª âª Birds fly over the rainbow âª âª Why then, oh, why can't I? âª Bravo! Bravo. And you, Captain, do you have anything for us? - Actually I do. - Hmm. And I have no hesitation in saying it will completely outshine your brilliant performances. So what is it? Close your eyes. Now open your eyes. Where do these come from? Well actually, I was saving them till we saw the sea. But now seems a more appropriate moment. I can see the sea through these little tubes of delight. What? I can see the sea through these little tubes of delight. Gentlemen, it's been a pleasure and an honor. If you could do something else, what would it be? Stupid question. Why? What if the company burned down and your parents said to you, "Listen, Stucky, there's no future here. Go do something else"? Why should I talk to you about this? You are a man without principles. I have lots of principles. - Want to hear one? - No. Do whatever makes you happy. What about responsibility? What about the responsibility to be happy? Raise your left arm. Shhh. See, you always do what you're told. No one told me to volunteer for the army. - No one. - But the only reason you did was to get away from the family business. It was the choice of the lesser evil for you. So now I'm asking: When will you do something that makes you happy? Good night. What happened? - It's gone? - You had gangrene. We had to amputate. - It hurts like hell. - Look at me! You gave your arm for the FÃ¼hrer. He will be very proud of you. Here, eat some chocolate. We have plenty. Are we... Are we going home now? Yes, we're going home. I think you and Smith should leave now. Are you sure? Josef is better, but we will only slow you down. I have a suggestion. Yes, Smith? I climb the hill and look for a better way. You stay here and make some kind of sled for Josef and then we'll all go. Do you know how to ski, Smith? I tried it once with my uncle when I was a nipper, sir. Oh, an expert. Excellent. I go with you. Good. It's wonderful here. It certainly is. One could stay here until the war is over. Maybe you should. But you'd probably miss home. My wife left me a week ago. She just left me with my... with my best friend. I'm sorry. I wanted to impress her and... I went too far. And... Here we are. She'll be back, old man. They've just left Germany. So I suppose you're serious about staying here? We could put one pair of skis underneath. With nails. What do you think? - Yes! - Why did you say "yes"? - I won. - You did not. I always wanted to be a painter. Of course you have. Then go for it. What about money? Go to Paris and paint the tourists. Get a cheap room and become a bohemian. Girls like that. There is a war on. Yes or no, Trunk? My father will be very disappointed. Maybe not. You don't know my father. It seems he doesn't know you either. Wonderful. See, its easier if we go that way. This is the plan, Trunky. We'll go back, get the others, then we'll walk slowly that way down the mountain. We'll look for signs. If we're in British territory, then you go further south. And the other way around. Good idea. I think you better go. I'm starting to like you. Go? I'll show you what downhill skiing is all about, matey. Ha! - Am I going too fast for you? - Out of my way, you sauerkraut. - Heh hey! - âª Rule, Britannia, Britann... âª Strunk! Strunk! Wake up. Stupid Englishman. Strunk. Hands in the air! Don't shoot. I'm British. What, British? Check him. He's British. You're safe. You're safe now. Stop! Hands in the air! Drop your guns! Drop your guns! I'm a British officer. - No! - Get up! Why? Someday I'll look up his family. Got a few things to tell 'em. We have plenty to talk about when we get down the mountain. Let's go. Go on. Walk. So you shot each other down on the 27th of April. - Answer. - Yes. And you and Air Gunner Smith - slept in the plane? - Yes. And the next day you arrive at the same cabin as the Germans? - Yes. - Isn't that a strange coincidence? Yes. In the cabin they kept you as prisoners of war because they had weapons and you had none? That's right. But you had a Luger and we found another one in the cabin. - Yes. - So the one thing I don't understand is why... why didn't you shoot them? This information goes straight to the Norwegian Army and from there to your commanding officer. I'm not an expert, but the way I see it, they will think that you are traitors... both of you. Yes? The lieutenant wants to deliver something. Okay. You want something, Lieutenant? Yes. It belongs to Captain Davenport. It's only a lighter. We've checked it. And now you want to return it? Yes. Why do you have his lighter? I took it from him. Was that all, Lieutenant? Yes. Come with me. Lieutenant Horst Schopis tells the same story. They kept you as prisoners, blah blah blah. But you know something? I don't believe either of you. And if I find the slightest evidence that you have been collaborating, I am coming after you. Listen to me, you twisted cheese-eating gnome, while you've been sitting on your ass down here waiting for the sun to shine, we've been struggling to survive in a remote cabin with some Germans. And we did survive. Most of us. And now I have my lighter back. And that is the end of the matter. Anything else? No. Good. Let's go, Smith. Move. This way. Horst Schopis spent seven years in Canada as a POW. A few days after returning to England, Davenport and Smith took off on a raid over Trondheim. Once again they were shot down. Davenport was captured and spent the rest of the war in a German prison camp. Smith was killed during the attack. Strunk was buried at Trondheim cemetery. Josef spent the rest of the war in a Canadian prison camp. In 1977 Horst received a phone call in his Munich home. It was Davenport. He invited Horst to come to London. Soon after the two enemies met. As friends. All names have been changed except for Horst Schopis', by his own request.
