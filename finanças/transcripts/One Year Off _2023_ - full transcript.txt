- Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Amen. I could always visit you in Edinburgh. But I love our sexy Notting Hill weekends. Don't you? Of course. I love the movie. I love that you love the movie. - I love our time together. - You silly thing. You'll miss your plane. My friends say you've got another woman back home and three kids named Jock. That is not true! It's five kids, and only two of them are named Jock. Who cares what your friends say, anyway? Well, I do. They're the closest thing I have to family-- I get it, I get it. I met them, remember? Ah, yes. I... I admit they were a little off the charts and possibly off their meds. Are you sure you want us to move in together? Of course I do. I... I just need a few months to get things sorted out. A few months? You know, it only took them six weeks to film Notting Hill. It's not that long. I know. I just... I hate goodbyes and it just seems like my life is permanently on hold with customer services. We'll fix that as soon as I return, my darling. I'll come see you off. No, no, no, no. You stay where you are. You know I hate goodbyes. I love you. Claire Chambers. I love you. Is that your phone? Oh, no. Richard! Ugh. Eww! Agh! Claire, I'm in the middle of a lesson. It's happened again. What? I need wisdom, and wine, and chocolate. And tell Theo. I need Theo. Hello, gorgeous. It's Claire. What's the guy done this time? We're on the break-up duty again. Been summoned to the depression den. Oh, it'll be that ghastly Scotsman with his funny combover and Windsor knots. I knew this would happen. I never trusted him. He's got snake eyes. I said to her, "He's got snake eyes." Theo! Oh, calm down, bitch! I'm already on my way. And I know, bring chocolate. - Um, how do you not remember Richard? - I... Clara, in my defense, there've been very, very, very - many, many, many, many, many men. - Mm-hmm. Not that many. Just like five. - This year. - Okay, whatever. I'm nearly 40. I'm bound to have a history. Is that him? Is that the pig? Oh, it'll be my friend Caroline. Her wedding venue burned down. She's hysterical. At least she has a fiancé. Well, this is clearly all my fault. What did I do wrong? Oh, darling, be like me. Take a vow of celibacy. Now... Ooh. There. Thanks. Oh, my God. If that is your friend with her wedding-- - Oh, it's Ben. - Oooh! Ben! Claire! How are you, darling? - Hey, Ben! - You're all there. We're all here. We're on a, you know, mercy mission. Hey, guys. I'm sorry to interrupt, but I'm calling you 'cause I got a little news that I need to share with you. Arnie Sandoval died. Oh, my God! Arnie Sandoval died?! Arnie... hmm. Who is Arnie Sandoval? Apparently, he's my biological father. - What?! - What?! Ben, you don't have a father. I mean-- I mean, who was he? He's from Saint Kitts and Nevis. It's a-- it's a-- an island in the Caribbean, the West Indies. And apparently, I'm his only heir and I inherited his estate. Wait, I'm sorry. Ben, how do you feel about all this? I'm just trying to wrap my head around this whole thing. I'm-- I'm a bit confused. And I need you guys. I really do. I... I want you to come with me because I need to go down there and sign some papers and-- and, um, I don't think I can do this thing alone. So, my dear friends, I'm asking you to go on a little adventure with me. Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes. I'll see you next week, guys. I love you all. Thank you. - Oh... - Bye. Oh, my God! What?! Ben Katzman. You lucky bastard. Baby, what's up? Nothing, darling. Go back to sleep. Mm. Who called so early? It was Ben. He just inherited some property in the Caribbean. Mm-hmm. He wants to know if we'd like to go for a week's vacation there. Well, who wouldn't? He's paying for everything. What? What? Are you serious? - Oh, my God. - Seriously. Seriously. He's inviting Alex. Are you okay with that? Of course I'm okay with that. Why wouldn't I be? You married me. - Does that mean-- - Yes! Yes, baby. We're going. Baby, you look amazing. She's gotta stop taking selfies. There they are! Well, hey! Claire! Theo! Oh, my God! - Oh, my God! - Thank you so much for being here. You look so beautiful. Thank you all, you all look beautiful. I have an announcement to make. Claire is no longer in the market for love, and Alex is just here for sex. - Oh. - Mm-hmm. And by the way, the driver looks good. Hello, sir! Hello! Oh, Theo, you old queen! Come here. Oh, oh. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Don't stop it! Don't stop it! Megan, your husband just assaulted me. Oh, no. I'm sure he was just kidding. Ba-baby, tell him you're just kidding. Baby, it's a joke. Come on, guys! Let's get on the boat. Here we go. - Yes! - Let's go! Oh, my God! Welcome to Nevis. Charlie Brooks, your father's lawyer. We spoke on the phone. Yes. It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. Hello, Charlie. Oh, Ben. It's beautiful. I love it. Oh, my God. It's so beautiful, babe. All the pretty trees! Ben Katzman. You're a lucky bastard. If I were you, I'd stay here forever. Look who's here. They're here. - Hello. - Hi. - Welcome, Mr. Katzman. - Hi. Hi. I'm Sheldon, your father's butler, and this is my wife, Lois. - Hello. It's such a pleasure to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - This place is-- - Magical. Magical. Yes, it is. Mr. Katzman, my wife and I are deeply sorry for your loss. I'm so, so sorry to interrupt, but I really have to use the bathroom. - I'll take you. - Okay. Thank you. And please, I'm sorry, but I'm dying for a shower. It's way too hot for me. Yeah, I'll take you to your room. - Are you Claire? - Yes. I am. Nice to meet you. And are you Theo? - I am. - Yes. You are staying at the beach club. Okay? - Okay. - All right. Great. - All right. Come on, ladies. This way. - Okay. Okay. - Bye, baby. - Bye-bye. Come on. Come on. Hm. And you must be Ben. I'm Ashley. I manage the beach club. I guess you met my mum and dad. I'm Claire. Ashley, did you say? Yes. Say something. I'm Ben. - Hey, baby. - Hey, baby. It's really hot. I'm gonna go take a shower and get changed. You gonna come? No, I'm gonna stay here for a while. Okay. Mwah. How's the club doing? Has it changed? No. Well, it's dingier. We're only open twice a week now, post-COVID. You know, George and Alex were the big pull back in the day. When Theo and I were waiters, we could barely get across the room. It was packed. Yeah. Well, the world's changed. We've changed. Have we? Mm-hmm. I'm glad you're happy, George. We are... happy. Well, I mean, she is. Look, I know she's a bit of an Energizer bunny, and I'm not. Well, I mean... I used to be relentless back in the day. Hey, don't even say it. Oh, Georgie, please. I'm just laying here, biting my tongue like a good friend. Look, she's not as bad as you think she is, okay? Oh, George. No one was thinking that. - You said it. Not me. - Alex, retract the claws for once. Okay? Ah, leave her, Theo. It's gonna come out at some point. You love her, George, and that's all that matters. - Thank you. - I mean, come on, guys. It can't be easy for her. Look at us. We've known each other for over 15 years. - Fifteen? - Fifteen. We're old. I need a drink! Hm. This is Chrishi Beach, and it's all yours now, Ben. Yeah. I think I... I'm gonna need a drink. Pick your poison. So where are we staying? Oh, the beach house. It's just over there. - Theo! - Bye! Bye. Oh-ho. Oof. Robyn makes the best cocktails on the island. Robyn, meet Ben. He's the new owner. And these are his friends, Megan and George. Welcome to The Love Shack Bar, guys. - What can I get you? - Hi. I would love a frozen margarita. George, this is not Cancun. This is Nevis. I can do better than that. Well, fantastic. Surprise us, please. Sounds good. Coming right up. I'm gonna go dance, baby. Come with me. Mwah. Come on. Come on. Come on. I'm going dancing. Ugh. Disgusting. Hate it. This won't do at all. Absolutely not. I'm going back to my cozy kitchen-bathroom combo. - Ah! - Who says you get the best bedroom, bitch? Hi. Oh, my God, Claire! My bed feels like I'm sleeping on Burt Reynolds' chest hair-- lo. I'm Harry. I... I work at the club. I didn't know you guys arrived. You need anything? No, thank you. We're perfectly okay. Well, I shall have to call you Prince Harry, for you are a prince among men. Prince Harry? Okay. Well, I'll be at the club if you do need anything. Well, thank you, my prince. Woman! I know that look. I don't want to slap you, but I will. You're thinking of falling for that tall, impossibly good-looking man with the perfect ass, aren't you? No, definitely not. Not interested at all. Sure, he's handsome, articulate, age-appropriate, and apparently gainfully employed. But I'm over men. I'm just here to focus on me. Okay, now how many times have we heard that? Ah! I've never liked you! Got my hair wet. Oh, and that guy was shouting at you because you were wearing fur. Oh, my God! Yes! And he was like, "What poor creature had to die for you to wear this coat?!" - And you said? - "My Aunt Vera." "May she rest in peace!" And, Theo, you were under the table. What were you doing under there? - Come on. What were you doing? - Oh, no! You're doing all my questions! It was me. Remember the heels? - Oh, the big ones! They were gorgeous. - They were gorgeous! But they were 7" heels. I twisted my ankle, my right ankle. The osteria was to the left. I could only turn right, right? So, I'm under the table. My leg is like this high. Who's there with me under the table? - Georgie! - You lie. You lie. What was the owner's name? Luigi! God, it was too good. It was too good. But seriously, that poor guy. - But didn't he try to throw us out? - Baby... Yeah. Because-- would you blame him? We were too noisy! Baby? I'm-- I'm gonna have to step away, okay? - Okay. - Could you blame him? I mean, come on. Yeah, but that's when we pretended that we got married. I had too much fun. And then-- we were at each other's throats out at the club. That was amazing. How long do you all know each other for? - Too long. - Oh, gosh. Way too long. This one is the older brother that I never had. Oh. I love you too. Hello. Charlie? I thought we were gonna meet tomorrow. Yes, but I thought I'd abandoned you somewhat earlier. So, I saw the house lit up. I said, "Why not?" Like the good old days. The parties, the hijinks, the goings-on. I just need your signature and a witness. Perhaps your charming friend. I'd love to. How to get a witness. Hey, to the witness! - To the gorgeous witness. - Witness! I just love your cooking. Ooh. Georgie, you... Mm. That is fabulous. What is that? - It's my secret. - Will you teach me? I wanna learn how to cook like you. Of course I will, honey. So many nights... your father and I would sit here, drink rum, and have endless discussions about life. The papers. Now, I have already marked the signature pages for you and the witness to sign. Very good. Now, when we spoke on the phone, you expressed a desire to perhaps sell the estate? Of course, I can assist you with that, if that's your intention. Uh, well, about that... I just, uh... I think I'm gonna need a couple days to think about that. This is huge. Of course you need time to think. Yes, take your time. Meanwhile, enjoy our beautiful island. And if you decide to sell, there are already several very interested buyers. Really? Could you give us a moment, please? Of course. Thank you. - How do you feel? - I feel pretty good, I guess. More important question is, Claire, how do you feel? I need a reset. All these years of trying to find love... I'm done. I just need to focus on me. I'm so happy you're here with me. Thank you. Me too. So that's him? Yeah, that's him. I wish I knew what he had in mind for me. I don't know what he's got on his mind, but I know you've got Ashley on yours. Ashley? Well, she is-- Ravishing? Yes, exactly. And she's too young for me. No, she's my age. I already asked. And that would be 34? Yes. I have been for the past five years, and I intend to stay there. Oh, I've missed you so much. I missed you too. - Shall we? - Yeah. Oof. - Be happy. - I am. Yeah, but you were so drunk, you fell off your chair. - Ha! I'm Russian. - I feel. Ben. This one's for you, my friend.

I think he's getting ready to sell Golden Rock. - I can feel it. - Don't be so pessimistic. Just let them enjoy their time here. Daddy? Please? I'd like to make a toast. To Arnie Sandoval. Arnie would have... he would have just loved this! What was he really like? The man was a legend. It would take days to do him justice. Just a remarkable fellow. When I first came here from the States, Arnie helped me get set up here. He was like... the mayor, the don of the island, the pope of the Caribbean. I owe him everything. It's peaceful here. Nevis is a place where peace and harmony is everything. Charlie... Do a lot of people come to the island just to get married? Dozens of marriages, maybe dozens of dozens. And that includes quite a few pitched in by yours truly. I've married and divorced four Mrs. Brooks on this very island. If you're gonna have miserable divorces, you may as well have magical weddings. That's exactly what I was thinking. Come on. You're impossible. - What are you smiling about? I'm thinking about how lucky I am... right now in this moment, in this place. Right here. I finally found out who my father was, where I came from. Sitting here in this beautiful place... with my dearest friends in the world. Yeah, I'm lucky. And I just wish it would never end. What if it doesn't have to? What if we just... stay? A little tipsy, Claire? I'm drunk, but not on rum. Must be the beer. No. It's this place. It's this moment. I'm drunk on the possibilities. What possibilities? Of us being here together. What if we open a wedding business? You are drunk. No, think about it. - "Paradise Weddings." - Claire. I'm happy, finally. It took me six years of therapy after my divorce. I-- I don't believe in marriage, and I don't think you believe in it either. I have to believe in them. Please. You got the floor. Guys! Guys, okay, I've got an idea. And I know it's gonna sound crazy, but just please hear me out. What would you say about staying here? - She's drunk. - Just for a while... for a few months or like a year, just so that we can be together again, and just live, and love, and laugh, - and have fun, and breathe. - I love it! - Doing what? - Yeah. Romantic weddings at the beach club. - Oh. - Just think about it. The sand, and the sun, and-- and the ocean, and romance. It's perfect. And come on, none of us are particularly happy right now. Oh, well-- You might want to speak for yourself, because George and I are really happy together. Urgh. Okay, well, I'm not happy. And I think I speak for most of us when I say we hate our jobs. And I hate being single in my stupid flat in London. And, Theo and Alex, I know that you guys feel the same way. - Yeah. - So, what if we just start fresh here? I'll put it to the guys. What do you think? What do we think? Claire, come on. What on Earth do any of us know about weddings? I mean, we're not exactly, you know, shining example of marital bliss here, okay? Hmm. Oh, come on, babe. Look at the rest of us. I mean, single. Single. Celibate nymphomaniac... - Ah! - ...which is a hell of a condition, but we're still miserable. Yeah. But look, come on. Even if that was the case, I mean, we can't just up sticks, - and just leave everything behind. - Yeah. But why not? Come on! This place is special. Megan, you heard how George sang tonight. That's the George we know and love. And, Alex, come on. Do you really want to be teaching Chopin to spoiled rich kids forever? You hate it. It's true. I do hate it. And, Theo, you haven't even touched your camera for two years, and you have nothing to go back for. Wow! Tell it like it is. I mean, how do you propose to do this plan? Well, um, I could do the marketing, and-- and Ben can be the host with the most, like he was back in the day. And every wedding, I guess, needs music, so... - Yes! - And I suppose I could do some singing. ♪ Look for... ♪ And I can prepare the food with Lois! I could be a bridesmaid! - Or... ? - Or I could take the photographs. If it's of any help, I'm an ordained minister. I always knew it would come in handy one day. It's perfect! We could totally do this! We can totally do this. Please say yes, please. Please, please, please. To one year off! - What's going on? - Looks like we're staying. Hi, Claire. You're blocking my view, Barry. By the way, it's Harry. Right. So, is this your job? Kind of. I've been working at the club ever since I drifted into this paradise. Sheldon, Lois and Ashley are like family to me. That's very nice to hear, Larry. It's Harry. Sorry? Never mind. So, Ashley tells me that you and your friends are going to be here for a whole year. Maybe. I didn't pack my crystal ball. Well, you could always borrow my Magic 8-Ball in a pinch. That's a good joke, Jerry. It's still Harry. That it is. Well, okay then. I'm gonna get back to the club. I'm just gonna lie here for a bit longer. Bye, Claire. - Hey. - Hey. I was wondering, have you seen my wife? Uh, yeah. She went to the market with Lois. Oh, good. This is the best. I found my father's diaries. - Yeah? - Ooh. Here, have a read. Just read anything. "Last night, Rudy Nureyev--" - Nureyev? - Nureyev. "...came over. Such a hoot. We drank too much vodka and I beat him at whist. His ankle was swollen, and I made him sit with it above his head, because it always does the trick." - Really, Nureyev? - Nureyev. Turns out that my father truly was a legendary person. Everything everybody's saying about him is true. I mean, he knew everybody. I'm talking everybody. He knew Khrushchev, Che Guevara. He talks about rolling cigars with Fidel Castro. - Castro? - Yeah. Castro. - Really? - It's incredible. But my favorite... He knew Ernest Hemingway personally. He talks about swapping mojito recipes with Ernest friggin' Hemingway. And let me tell you, there's tons of this stuff. I mean, it's everything-- it's important, it's funny, it's fascinating. I mean, fascinating. - Hemingway? Hmm. - Hemingway. Hold my matryoshkas . Gentlemen, hello. - Hey, how are you doing? - Oh, I'm doing just fine, thank you. Have a nice day. Well, you're going young, aren't you? First of all, they are in their early 20s, and I am in my early to mid-40s. Okay? - Cougar. - Yeah. And your point? Oh, excuse me. He is very cute. - Go easy on my guests. - Oh, please stop. You know me. I'm just looking. Hey! And I'm liking. Claire? Hello, sweetheart. About last night... - Yes? - Um... Maybe we should hammer out some of those ideas you have. I was worried you might have changed your mind after the alcohol evaporated. No, I've never been more sure of anything in my life, Claire. Me too. - Well, first things first. - What? Well, now we have to find someone who wants to get married. Oh. Funny you should say that. Caroline! I know, I'm sorry. No, I... I wasn't ignoring you. I should have called you back. But I'm calling you now. Yes, I know. Awful. I'm so sorry. Yes. But listen, Caroline. What would you say to a romantic wedding on the most beautiful beach in the world? That's the thing. It could happen. I could make it happen. We've got our first customer, guys. We are open for business.

Thank you. We are gathered here to witness the marriage of Caroline... and Alan. And what a lovely vision you are, Caroline. - Thank you. - And you, Alan. Reminds me of my last wedding. Bittersweet memories. But this is your wedding. I can't imagine that there any objections? No? Alrighty, then. Caroline, do you take Alan to be your loving husband, loving him in sickness and in health, richer or poorer? I do. And you, Alan, do you take Caroline to be your loving wife, loving her and cherishing her, but also good to obey her? Obey more than cherish. That's my two cents. I do. I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. Claire, this is for you. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No... This is the happiest moment of my life. To us. - Clara. - Alex. Whoo! Congratulations to the happy couple! - Congratulations. - Congratulations. Caroline... - I love you. - I love you. I think we pulled that off. You did good. And you're not as annoying as I thought you would be. Sorry about the bouquet thing. I was trying really hard not to catch it. That was pretty obvious. Why? Mm, hold my rum. I have stories and they are not fairy tales... which is probably why we got off on the wrong foot. Did we? I hadn't noticed. - So, I have a question. - That sounds serious. Where do you live? I mean, you just show up at the club every afternoon. Are you yet another man leading a shady double life? I am. I am married, and I take care of my five children in the morning. All called Jock, I bet. No, no, no. They're all named Barry Jr. I'm not buying it. You're not the marrying type. I like to think that I am. I've just committed too much time to my work. Oh, so you have a job other than bumming around the club? I do, and I have Ashley to thank for that. So, you and Ashley are close? We are. We share the same passion. And that passion happens to be what I do in the morning. Well, my, my. Aren't we being mysterious? One day, when you're not too busy planning ways to make other people happy, and maybe you want to make yourself happy, would you like to see where I disappear to in the morning? Nah, I'm over it. - What was that for? - Mm, because I'm happy here. Aren't you happy too, baby? Golden Rock is a magical place. Back then, it was a secret place where artists, intellectuals would come to get away from the limelight, having long conversations with Arnie. Well, that's nothing... nothing short of remarkable. Your father was a humanist. You would see him with politicians you would not expect to be together, arguing back and forth. But what he really, really loved... were artists, many of whom came here. Why do you... think it is, with all of the... the amazing people from around the world that he met and spoke to and... - that I never made that list? - Hm. I'm absolutely certain he wanted you to be on that list. It never got a chance to happen. Knowing now what kind of a man he was, he must have had a good reason not to contact my mother and me for all those years, and-- and why would he leave this home, his estate, to an estranged son? There's got to be a reason. What I can tell you... is that when he met your mom in the '60s, the very definition of what he was made him a target. A target? The FBI thought your father was a Communist. Well, you do have to admit that some of the writings in his diaries do have a strong tone of, shall we say, fringe thinking. Mm-hmm. Your mother was torn between the depth of passion she felt for him and her devotion to your safety. I am absolutely convinced that that tension was a big reason why your father left. Ugh. I just, uh... I can't wrap my head around everything right now. - It's just-- - Dad? Mum's wondering where you are. She needs help in the kitchen. Well, good night, Mr. Katzman. Ben. Good night, Ben Katzman. That's close enough. - Night-night, Dad. - Good night. I guess I should go and help my mum, too. I thought it was your night off? Yes, it is. But if you need me, you can always call. Would you like to go for a walk? - What? Now? - Yeah. It's a beautiful night. What do you say? I say yes. I live on the beach by the club. You can walk me home. Do you think we'll be single forever? - Oh, God, I hope so. - What? Well, I love lying like a starfish in the bed. And who wants to argue over which way to hang the toilet paper? I think I do. Are you still in love with George? Good morning, Sheldon. Good morning, Mr. Katzman. Please, just call me Ben. - Good morning, Lois. - Good morning, Ben. - How are you? - Another lovely day in paradise. Yes, it is. Sheldon, I... I've read most of my father's memoirs and... there's no mention of my mother. He writes all these wonderful stories about Golden Rock and these amazing people, but he doesn't mention anything about his time in the United States or my mother. Is there possibly another journal that I haven't seen? I'm afraid I don't know. Alrighty. Sheldon Rollins, you're a bad man. What did I do? I am a good Christian woman. Don't you lie to me! I gave my word. I mean, I have really caught the light here. I mean, look at the frame on this one. Hey, how you doing? - Claire. Sweetie. - Huh? This frame, not that one, huh? Yes. Focus. You know me. Wow. These are actually really good. Somebody got their mojo back. Well, I mean, I am extremely talented. - Ben. Right. - Wonderful. - Guys... - Hi. ...now that we know we can crush it, it's time to take the next step and generate some more business, which means spending some money. So, I did. I made us a website. It's gonna be up in three days, - Theo, I'll need some pictures for it. - You're damn right you will. We just need some more clients. I think one more wedding and we might have made ourselves some legitimate street credibility. Yes, I can see it now. "Breaking News: Woman Who's Sworn Off Love Forever Suddenly Becomes Miss Wedding Paradise Organizer Extraordinaire!" Amen to that. Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. Another perfect day. Oh, my gosh. This looks so amazing, you guys! And the asparagus is so lush and so green, babe. I'm just gonna dip it in the sauce a little bit. So good! So yummy! Mm, can you pass me the chicken? Sure. Knock yourself out. Oh, it's is so tender. Mm. I'm just gonna dip it in the sauce again. Oh, it's so good! Oh, my gosh. And the salmon. Can I have some of the salmon? Oh, my gosh. Is this papaya? Amazing. Hello. No, I can't hear you. Someone seems to be having an orgasm over lunch. No, no, I'm just... no, I'm just kidding. Who is this? And the good news is that there's plenty left in the kitchen. Yeah, there's gonna need to be. Darling, that-- that must slow down. Yes, it is papaya. They do exist. Georgie, Georgie, Georgie, Georgie, good luck. So wonderful! Baby. Baby. Baby. - Mm-hmm? - Is everything okay? Oh, it's way-- it's fabulous! You need to just slow down just a little. Hey, guys, that was Charlie. I gotta go over and sign some papers. Can I come? I'll drive. Well, sure. Come on. Baby, I have to, um... Ahem, uh, yeah. Um... Whatever. - Ashley, can I ask you something? - Sure. Harry says he does something other than work at the club, but it sounds really shady, and, you know, guys who look like him usually are. So, does he actually have another job? Yes, he does. And he is right behind you. So you can ask him yourself. Okay. Good luck with that. Look like what? Hi, Claire. Hello. I wanna show you something. Come on. Your cook is so fabulous. I mean, for him to put out this spread so fast, in all the colors of the rainbow. I am-- About to go viral. I love Nevis! So, one week's vacation turned into you walking away from everything? Well, not really. I mean, no one's given up their homes, or sold their businesses or anything. It's more like a sabbatical, if any of us were smart enough to be professors. How about you? Did you leave anything behind? Well, I haven't told anyone yet, but I handed my notice in at work. The wedding business was my idea, and I figured I ought to put my lack of money where my mouth is. We just need a few more couples. So, you're really going for it. A full year off. Yes, well, you know, you only live once. Life's not a dress rehearsal, and live, laugh, and love. Here we are. Casa Buchanan. A boat. Heh. You live on a boat. - Whoa! This is nice. - Yeah. Yeah. Welcome to Sunshine, my brothers. - You're the famous Sunshine. - Yes, mon. - I'm George. Respect. - Respect. We're here to meet Charlie. Charlie is over here in the pink cabana. Sometimes we call it a house of Judah. Judah. Come along. Hello, Charlie. Is something wrong? Nothing's wrong. Uh, your message was a little cryptic. I was a little nervous. Sheldon called me. He and I were your father's oldest friends, which came with a certain moral protection of his memory. We had to be sure the time was right... to give you this: Your father's memoirs of his trip to America. His love affair with your mother, their love letters, your birth. His soul is in this book. Why did you wait until now? We had to be sure you were ready for it. And furthermore, Sheldon informed me Lois was gonna kick him out of the house if I didn't give you this. All those famous people you read about in the book, Arnie didn't court them. It was the other way around. If he sought after your mother... she must have been a very, very special woman. She was. One more thing. Your father left a letter for you. Ben, you're ready to be a Sandoval. So what do you actually do? You still think I'm a beach bum. Well, I didn't say that, per se, but if the flip-flop fits... Ahem. I mean, obviously it's something to do with the ocean. So, you teach people to dive, or you take boatloads of American tourists out to get drunk and puke into the Atlantic. I'm actually a conservationist. I'm helping document the biodiversity fluctuation around the lower southeast Caribbean. I study fish. - Wow. - So... what's this long story of yours? Oh... Are you worried I'll judge you? No, I'd be worried if you didn't judge me. Oh, come on. - You really don't want to hear it. - I really do. - I can assure you, you really don't. - I really do. - But I don't want to tell you. - But I want you to tell me. Okay. It's just men. Just lots and lots of men. Lots of stupid, weird, obnoxious, self-centered, horrible men who I've put my career and life on hiatus for several times. So, whilst you've been out here saving the fish, I've just been nursing a hangover or heartbreak. It's pathetic. Hm. Could you, perhaps, clarify your use of the word "lots"? It's really not that bad. It's just four-- five-- six. Oh, that's okay. This year. W-wow. Uh... So what do you think is wrong with you? I think I just attract the wrong kind of men. Not sure what that says about me. Um... Yes, well, I really should be getting back, because I have lots of work to do. And it's hard to make a dramatic exit off this, isn't it? It's okay, Claire. Listen, there's... something I really wanna tell you. Yes? I think that... I found your next customer for your wedding business. Oh, right! Yes, of course. - A guy I went to Berkeley with. - You went to Berkeley? Valedictorian, I'm betting. Anyway, he just got engaged and he's having issues with the venue. Oh, this is brilliant. We're like the wedding vultures. Call him now whilst I'm here. Geez, you're-- you're pushy. You haven't seen anything yet. Just don't make us out to be too desperate. Although we are. Kent? Kent, hey. Yeah, how are you? Listen, Kent, I-- I just wanted to ask. Did you sort your wedding yet? Uh-huh. I'm sorry to hear that. But I think I've got the solution. Hold on. Claire? Hello, this is Claire Chambers of Paradise Weddings. Corporate announcement! You can all stop lounging around and acting like you're on holiday or something. We have another wedding! - Ooh. - Ah-ha! Harry has delivered us the wedding of his friend, Kent Jones, of Boston, Massachusetts, and Sydney, the only daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Carter Whitley III, also of Boston, Massachusetts. - Blimey! - I've spoken to Kent - and he's already wired us the deposit. - I love him already. This one's a little bit different, though. Much more old school. Kent's future-in-laws are paying, so we need to up our game. - Mm. - Okay, good. So, when is it? Three weeks. What? No pressure, then. Well, I will go get us some drinks. Alrighty. Well, looks like business is booming. Where are you going? I'm gonna go find Ashley and discuss some business strategy. Oh, "business strategy." Is that what you call it? Oh, that's funny, George. But we're just friends. Yeah. For now. So... you and Prince Harry, huh? Mm-hmm. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, come on. - It's purely professional. - Ugh! Professional, my ass! You do look good together. I'll drink to that. Cheers, sweetie. - I'm over men. - Oh. Hello. You could hear me. You thought I wouldn't. I thought you were somewhere in Tibet or something. What can I do for you, Mr. Katzman? Ooh, so formal. Kinda hurts. I'm teasing you, Ben. - What's up? - Well, I just want to let you know that we got our next client. A friend of Harry's. His name is Kent something, comes from Boston money. Very wealthy family, so it's really good for us. And, yeah, that's our next client. And I also want to know if maybe you wanted to go out to dinner with me. Tell me, what is the connection between you having booked a new client and you inviting me for dinner? - Absolutely nothing. - Thought as much. But I have what they call no game when it comes to inviting a beautiful woman out to dinner. But... just forget I ever said anything. I feel stupid now. Sorry, I-I interrupted. All right. You have a date. All right. Yes. - So, shall we meditate? - Yes. Thank you. Yeah. I can't believe that you're a music producer. Well, I tried to be. That's why I left New York and moved to London. I wanted to be a music producer. Couple months after I was there, I was at a club in Knightsbridge called Ciro's Pomodoro and that's where I met everyone. George and Alex, they were performing, and I thought they were brilliant, and I thought, "Hm. Let's see, I think I can... I think I can make something of this and promote them. Put a show together." And I did. And guess what? It was a complete disaster. I mean, disaster. It was terrible. But the beautiful thing about it was, we became great friends. We've been friends ever since, 15 years ago. Yeah, have you ever been to London? Haven't you noticed my accent? I mean... You must think I'm stupid. I have a degree in environmental studies from Oxford. - Oxford? Ooh. - Yes, Oxford. You thought I never left Nevis. Admit it. No, I didn't. I... Well, actually I did. I know you did. How come you left London and went back to New York? I got married. Met a woman in London, and her big dream was to live in New York City and own an antique shop, so I gave everything up. Ended up with a divorce that I never wanted and an antique shop that I never wanted. - Do you have children? - No, no. Haven't you noticed the family tree, that there's no name after mine on that? Oh, my God. You must think I'm so stupid. No. No, I don't. Not at all. - Alex tells me you're also a writer. - Well... I haven't written anything in a long time. You're different from other guys I meet, Ben. - I hope that's a good thing. - Who knows? Do you know why I brought you here? Because this place is very special. It's... Right here, in this spot, today I was given my father's journal that has all of the letters, the love letters between my mother and father. Why do you keep staring at me like that? Because I think you're beautiful. Thank you. Would you like some dessert? Always. I really had a good time tonight. - Yes, so did I. - Yeah. Very much. Well, I better get back. A lot of inventory to do. Aren't you going to kiss me? Good night, Mr. Katzman. Good night. - Hello? - Big day today. Look at this beauty! Caught this morning! I practically had to fight for it. Beautiful. Oh, and make sure they know I got up early to source this snapper, because there's none more fresher on the island. I just don't understand why you won't let the club do the catering. Ugh. Well, where's the fun in that? I love food. I love cooking. Okay, let's do it! Dearly beloved, welcome to paradise. We are gathered here to witness the marriage of Kent and Sydney. Cheers. I love you, dear. Thank you, Daddy. I love you. - So great. - You're stunning, just... And you were right, by the way. Who needs a wedding with 500 guests? It didn't cost me an arm and a leg. Daddy! - Is everyone having a wonderful time? - - Yes. May I introduce Megan, our executive chef? Hi, Megan. Hello, everyone. How's the meal so far? - Amazing. - Wonderful. Wonderful. So, this is Caribbean-sourced red snapper. - Ooh. - Caught this morning. Fresh from the fisherman! - Enjoy. - Okay. Thank you. A toast. - Not yet. Let's try this fish, shall we? - Snapper first. - Oh, gosh. This is good. - So smooth. - Oh, it looks so soft. - - This looks yummy. Cheers. Daddy! Mommy? What are you-- what are you doing? Why is she making that face? Come on, Daddy! Mommy, what are you doing? Daddy! What's wrong with Daddy? Do something. Dad! Mommy! Daddy! Daddy! Mommy! - Do something! - Honey! Oh, my God! We're gonna die. - Mommy! - I pooped. Oh. My. Gosh. Just a minute. Oh, my goodness! - Daddy! - No. No! How can you even look at me and just say you're sorry?! Do you even know what you've done? You ruined the most important day of my life! Do you even understand the stress that I've gone through, what we have done to be here, just to get here? I spent so much time picking out a dress for here! I don't have a video. I don't have photos. I have nothing! I will be destroyed! And it's all because of you! Do you even understand what you just did? I'm going to make sure my daddy sues you for every penny you have. He will take you down. You're incompetent. "Paradise Weddings"? Ha! My ass! I should have never trusted a blonde. Never! You poisoned my family. Did you see what I had to see? You made my daddy poop himself in a $4,000 suit! And it's not going to be forgotten. I will not stand for this! Are you-- are you even married? You're not even married? She's not married! Kent! Get your ass in here! So, how are the happy couple? - Filed for divorce yet? - It's not funny, Theo. That is rich coming from you, Claire, considering you basically bullied us into this venture. The least thing you could have is a sense of humor about it. I didn't bully your stupid wife into thinking she was Gordon Ramsey when all she knows about food is from YouTube! Don't talk to my wife like that! - Don't just blame Megan! - No, it was the fish. We should've used the catering company. Shut up, Alex! And stop being a bitch for once in your life. No, she's right, okay? She's right. It's my fault. I should have known better. But if one more person says I should have used the catering company, I'm gonna throw myself into the nearest volcano! Please, be my guest. Look, baby. It's not your fault. Oh, cut the crap, George. "It's not your fault, baby." Whose fault is it, huh? You guys remember the first wedding? It was perfect. It was freaking perfect. Rubbish! Utter crap! It was a fluke! We got through by the skin of our teeth. He's right. We have no idea what we're doing. - That's not true! - Someone could have died! I mean, by the way, are we insured? Nobody did die. And, no, I didn't take insurance. - Did you? - It's your bloody company! - That's why we're here. - Please just stop it! Can everyone relax? It is everybody's fault. Yeah, but mostly Megan's. I'm the one that ruined everything. I know that I ruined everything! Baby, Harry just said it's all of us. It's all our faults. Yeah, but he doesn't mean it. None of you guys mean it. You guys all laugh at me behind my back. You think I'm an idiot. You guys are all just a bunch of self-obsessed losers, with your stupid hats and your boring old stories about the old days. - Look, Megan, it's okay-- - No! No! Stop apologizing for me! I wanna go home. I don't like it in here anymore, okay? I messed up. I'm sorry. I just wanna go home. I am sorry I messed up! Okay? I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Thanks a lot, guys. Thanks. For goodness' sake. What's wrong with you people? Are you just gonna give it up? Are you gonna throw it all away and scuttle back to your everyday lives as if nothing happened? You haven't given the island a chance. You arrived and you fell into the whole holiday beach vibe mentality, and all you could think about was having fun and creating a business. You couldn't just sit and let the island speak for herself. Right, come on. I'm taking you on a hike. This is the beating heart of Nevis. This is what grounds me... what feeds my soul. What calls me back every time I leave the island. I need this like I need the air that I breathe. This is where I found how to live. It's where I found myself. This place gives me the rhythm by which I live my life. And it's a part of me. But only because I let it in. "My dear son... I've lived a full life with only one regret: leaving you. I held you in my arms when you were born, but I had to leave all too soon. I've been thinking about that day every moment of my life. Your baby smile... I don't want you to hold any bad feelings towards your mother. We were very much in love. But she was terrified that I would be arrested. So I left. We decided that it was better this way. I respected her wishes to go away. But now that I am gone, I want you to know who you are. You are my son, my blood. The roots of your family are on this island. Our history is in your blood, so I leave this house to you... because it's the history of our family. I hope your life here will be full of joy. Love this island, my son. She will give you more than you can imagine. I love you. Your father, Arnie Sandoval." Mazel tov!
