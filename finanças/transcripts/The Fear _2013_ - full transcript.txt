Fucking hell. The Fear Who do we belong to? What do you mean? Who do we belong to? I don't understand. You, Mum and me. Who do we belong to? Nobody. Why? Don't we belong to Dad? No, we don't belong to anybody. Morning. First ones here as always. - Hi, Salvador. - Morning. Bye, Mum. Xavi! Your folder. Here. Have a good day. - Hello, Coral. - Hello. - See you later. - See you. Got plans for the weekend? I'm seeing Laura, I think. And you? Getting really bored. My parents are making me go to the village. Tell them there's a match. We can shoot some baskets and then skate. - Skateboard? - Sure. I'll call my mum later. The light, please. I'm sure you know the phrase: "It's in the blood". Genetics is a branch of biology which studies inheritance and variation. Inheritance means the transmission of traits from parents to offspring. We are like we are because we inherited certain genes, half of which come from our father's side and the other half from our mother's side. That creates what we call our "genetic code". The genetic code is like a book of revelations, and it can be encouraging or depressing. It dictates who we are and, to a degree, predicts our future. Mutations can occur at anytime and anywhere. When a mutation is transmitted to the egg by the sperm, it is immediately incorporated into the genetic code of all the cells... Will you do the project with me? - I'm not going to do it. - Why not? I need to swot up on maths. Okay, I'll think about it. Not playing? I don't feel like it. Are you like your mother? What? Are you like your mother? I don't know. I guess. How? How exactly? Everyone says I am, although she reckons I'm just like my dad. Laura! - Let go of me! - Get off her! Coral! What is it? They wanted my doll. She's mine, and only mine. - Where's your brother? - He's coming. Manel, if I don't do it, they'll fail me. Look, I said I'd think about it. Coral, wait. Come on. I've helped you before. - Hello. - Hello. - Hi, Mum. - Hi. What's for dinner? Yummy! Breaded cutlets. Go on, wash your hands. - How was your day? - Fine, as usual. And yours? Fine, as usual. Will you lay the table? Thanks. Why don't we leave? Why don't the three of us leave? Where would we go? Mum, she's like this... Don't make fun of the teacher. But it's true, isn't it? She's got a neck like an ostrich. A bit. "Children, has anyone seen my egg? I don't know where I left it." Stop it. "It's a very big thing to lose." What's for dessert? Go and look in the fridge. Don't get involved. It's between me and your father. It's our business. Mum, stop pretending nothing is happening. I'm not blind. People don't live like this. What would you know? I can't find the pudding. I'm coming. I know how people live. Xavi's dad drives him to school. What do I have to do? You don't have to do anything. None of this is your fault. You don't have to find a solution. I don't want him to hurt you. And I don't want him to hurt you. Don't worry about me. I'll be okay. Hi, I'm Laura, leave... Laura, I have something to tell you. We can't keep seeing each other. We have to break up. Are you coming in? The biology teacher is expecting me. Okay. Go on, Messi. Shoot... Goal! Can I have one? Why don't you buy some? Because I don't smoke. Here. Come on. Hello? Hi, it's Marta... I was just about to call. I don't feel well. Is it the flu? No, it must be something I ate. I don't think it's serious. Did you vomit? I feel dizzy. Then take a few days off. No, I think I'll be back tomorrow. Okay. You take care. - Thanks, bye. - Bye. Where have you been? I had to see the doctor. - I didn't see you leave. - You weren't here. Go on in. What? I was with the biology teacher. Come in. Where were you? I'll tell you later. This poem is by Teresa of √Åvila, a prominent Spanish mystic. Read it. Then answer the following questions. Go and sit in my place. You owe me an explanation. I don't know how to explain. You wouldn't understand. I don't even understand myself. Try me. Can't you be quiet? Do the exercise. Join the league, like Xavi. Otherwise, you won't play. I don't think I can. Why not? You're good. You could even sign for a good team. You'll regret it if you don't. Trust me. I need to find a job. Manel, you're 15. I want to combine work and study. If I go to night-school, I won't have time to train. Do your parents need money? The thing is... they're about to get divorced and I want to help my mother. Manel, meet me in your sister's classroom. I need to talk to you. Hey, you two! Go and get changed. What happened? Tell your parents to call me. - I asked what happened. - She hit two girls. She doesn't hit people. She did today. Why? That's for your parents to ask. - Well, I'm asking. - On what authority? I'm her brother. I want to know. And I'm her teacher. And I'm telling you she hit two other girls and I want your parents to call. I put a note in her schoolbag. Make sure they see it. Don't worry, it was nothing. What is it? Nothing. I'll give you an answer tomorrow. Hello, Mummy. Something happened at school. I had a fight in class. Why? I don't have the authority. What? The teacher said I couldn't ask why. She sent a note. You have to call her. You or Dad. I'm going out. Can I see the note? Do you have the authority? I don't know... I get my wires crossed sometimes. I have to sort something out. I'll explain it later. Come. It's freezing. Mum. Okay, I'm on my way. Bye. I have to go. My mum worries and gets all nervous. I'll call you. Can I have a hug? Is that you in the photo? No. It's Dad with Grandma. What are you making? An album for me. The ones I don't like and the ones I do. Hello, Daddy. "Hello, Daddy." You okay? What did you do? What did you do? What is it? A girl insulted me and I hit her. What? A girl insulted me and I hit her. What did she call you? Look at me when I'm talking to you. What did she say? "Son of a bitch". Son of a bitch... No shit. What is it? Why didn't you tell me about this? I was going to tell you later. Go and put your pyjamas on. What's for dinner? Breaded cutlets and carrot puree. Jesus! Not puree again! - I like it. - Who asked you? What do you want? I'm laying the table. Doesn't look like it. - Where's my doll? - What doll? - My doll. - I haven't seen it. She must be here. There you are. You ran away. Where were you hiding? Be careful if you try to run away. I'll get a job. Don't worry about the money. We have to leave. We can rent a flat. He can stay here, alone. Alone? What do you want? Nothing. "Alone". Pass me the bread. Where do you want to go? Nowhere. What? Nowhere. And the suitcase in the bedroom? I was getting out the winter clothes. Can you hear her voice? Does she sound afraid? I called your mobile but you didn't answer. I left it behind, I was late for work. Who is it? I don't know. Give me the phone. Who is this Laura? Nobody. Go to your bedroom. Why? I want to talk with your mother. Do as he says. Manel. Make sure she cleans her teeth. Where are you going to go? Nowhere. Then why were you packing? I told you, I was just getting out the winter clothes. You do whatever you want. You didn't answer your phone... What did you say? That you forgot it... I always rush out in the morning. No, no. I'm the one who rushes out. I was going to be late for work. I think you and that Laura have it all agreed that you'll stay at hers when you leave me. Do you think I'm stupid? ...you're so ungrateful. If you leave, I'll kill you all. You're all so ungrateful. And you're the worst... ...you ungrateful whore! - The kids should know. - Leave them out of it. I don't understand you! I give you a home, food, security... What more do you want? All you do is punish them when you're in a mood or drunk. ...I'm the only one who works around here. You've never cared about them. Why would they love you? Because I'm their father. And you have to look after them. Get your sister and come in here. Hey, wake up. Get up. Coral. Come on. Mum is waiting for us. You'll be alone after all. Isn't that what you all wanted? I haven't kissed you in a long time. I'm sorry, because I really love you.
