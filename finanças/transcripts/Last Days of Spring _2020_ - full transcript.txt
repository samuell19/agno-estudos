Be careful you don't fall. You're falling. Hold on tight. One, two... and three. Here. Hello, baby. Look, for your birthday. You want to try? -No. You can tie it up there. And there. - Of course, and then there. He breke it. - That's okay, we'll fix it. It's for your birthday. We all wish you... A happy birthday to you! Blow. - Blow. He's not turning one... He's not turning two... He's turning three! My grandson, you've grown so big. More, more, more. - More, more, more. He wants more. He wants more. Look who's there. They arrived. - Finally. I thought you weren't coming anymore. Hello. - How are you? This is for my grandson, right? - Look what you've got. Here you go. - Here. Here, come see what you've got. - Open it. Look. - Open it. Go ahead. What is it? - A motorbike. Damn, what a nice one. - Awesome. So nice, so nice, so nice, so nice. It's not right how they walk in here. - Easy now. They do whatever they like. - That's enough Angelo. That unfinished construction? - Yes, that's mine. You're not allowed to build anymore. - Yes, I know. It would be stupid, since they're going to tear it all down anyway. -Yes. Why did you let them in? - They said it was a routine check. Listen... - They're just doing their job. I don't care. You shouldn't have let them in. Okay. - This is our house, we're in charge. But you welcome them everywhere. - Let it go, Angelo. LAST DAYS OF SPRING David! Always the same. David! Goddammit - Come on, get up. Are you deaf? You know what I dreamed? - What? That my teeth fell out. We don't have money for the dentist. - It was only a dream. You should brush your teeth more often. - Like I never brush them. You should do it more often. - Yeah. What's up? I thought you weren't coming. - I'm here. What's up? What's up? - How are you? Okay, a little tired. Smoke? -No. Cigarette? - Yes, please. Do you have a light? And that song? -I made a new one. Let me hear. What's up? - What's going on? You can't stop eating, right? Eating, eating, food, food, food. What's up? - How are you? Been here a long time? -I just arrived. I thought nobody was coming. - You didn't have breakfast? There's the bus. - Give me a drag of your cigarette. I'm sitting in the front. Me too. - First that arrives. Roll to the top. Be careful with your back. Keep it straight. Do you know how? -Yes. Alright, do it with the curler. How's it going, David? - Good. Ah, very good. You're pretty advanced. Very good, with the curler. Make the tip look good. Very good. OK. Continue like this. Listen, Jesus. We're working. Oh, I've mixed up your hair. What did you do? -I borrowed it. What? -I borrowed it. You mean you stole it, right? David, don't do that again. Don't steal. I prefer you ask for it. Did you hear me? Stop messing around. Don't do that again. Don't shoot yet. -No. Here's another one. There. Shoot. Don't shoot me. I almost did. Like this, I'm going to bounce it. See? - I'm the best. We're gathered here today... because we want to discuss the rumours you've been hearing about the relocations. Th'e land's been sold. So in the coming months you will start receiving letters... saying you'll be relocated. Can you imagine my children's shock when they see their house demolished? They're so happy here. They play, they run, they do whatever they want. This will be so hard on them. We've lived there for 18 years, struggling for their sake. If I earn 20 euro's, I'll spend 10 on my house and 10 for the kids. It's a shame. If they really tear our house down... It will be a great loss. They'll be taking everything we have from us. Our joy and happiness. I'm exhausted. So what? Well, the same as always, dear. They've told us they'll be sending us letters about the relocation. So that's it. Just that. They said they'll relocate us somewhere else this time. But it's still vague, so I don't know. It's the same story as always. They didn't say when? No. They only told us they'll be sending letters to all the families here. My god, this was expected to happen. It's the same old story. We'll stay here for a long time. Melena? - What? Where's Alex? - Inside. Alex! - Yes. Come, let's go. - Coming. Alejandro, did you have breakfast? - Yes. Another boot! Take the coffee-maker, and get that... This can be useful. Let's go. -Yes. From the chair to over there. From the blue cube to the bucket. From there to the vacuum cleaner. And from the wheel till there. And we finish here. Alright, yes, good, very good. - Shall we? Alright. Go ahead. Let's go. Oh wow. - You've lost weight. Stop. Here. This is for you. - OK, Tony. And? How much did we get? - 40 euros. Although her mailbox was piling up and her bills remained unpaid... nobody in her neighbourhood realized the harsh reality. This and the fact that her blinds were closed... are the reasons nobody noticed that something was wrong for 5 years. Something is failing regarding loneliness... affecting more and more people in more places in the last...' Dad? - Coming. Uncle! The light is gone. - Coming, coming. Dad! Dad, the light. David, the light went out again. - What can we do? It's always the same. These cables are terrible. If I fix one, there's another one that breaks. Careful. Let's see. What does it say? - 260. 260? - 256. 255. Take these. Let's all go home. - Alright. See you later. If it happens again I'll call you. Of course. - Alright then. If he's playing well in Barga... why throw him out of the selection because he's not scoring? Well, he is... - You can't play for a team and not score. He can't help that. - That's what football's all about. If you're the world's best player you have to play well and he's not doing that there. That has nothing to do with it. If I play well and score... But he was there and played the game. - I've always liked Cristiano Ronaldo. Yes, but he was injured. What can he do if he's injured? Right? Does any of you boys have a smoke? - Yes. You have a light? -Yes. Aren't you Angelo's brother? -Yes. How's he doing? - Good, he's married and has a kid. He's Angelo's brother. - OK, so he's the brother of Angelo. And what are you waiting for? - For the bus. To go to the hairdresser's course. - Hairdressing? All right. What's your name? - David. Where do you live? -Number 135. Of course, where Angelo lives. -Yes. Well, we're going. -OK. See you around, OK? -OK. What a car. -Did you see how it pulled up? A real beauty. -Yes, really nice. Did you see that? -I really love that car. What a beast. OK, so should Messi play or what? Up! -First your robe. Maria? -What? What should I tell Isa? -That she can keep him, Angelo! You'll see the scandal he'll make. Can you take him already? You're such a pain! Get your gun. Hurry. Give me your hand! -I'm going. Your hand, the other one. You always take hours, girl. -I'm coming. Where are the keys of the car? -I don't know, look for them. Ready at last? -Leave me alone. Always the same with you. -Angelo, stop it! You're messing up my hair. -Give me a kiss. You're such a pain! Such a pain. -Take it easy. Stop annoying me, give me my bag. Which one is it? -This one. Is it this one? -Yes. Wait. I see you later, OK? -OK. Drive safely. -Yes. Mom? Are you home alone? You've grown so big. So little. Sweet dreams. Here. My little boy. Granddad! -No, stay there. Your grandfather is going to check something with the electric cable. I'm going to see about the lighting. -Come to your mommy. Chino? What are you doing, are you busy? I came to talk to you about the light. I found a generator. I want to try buying it. I can get it really cheap. Let's see if we can all chip in. What else can we do? You need the whole neighbourhood to join. -That's what I'm trying to do. I don't have 150 euro's now and if I tell my wife... Besides, they want to tear us down. Talk to her. I really think it's worth it. How much longer will we be here? One month, two months? No, that's not... -It's a lot of money. They always say that, and then you end up staying for months or even a year. I don't know, man. -It can't stay like this, it's dangerous. Paying a lot of money for the little time we're staying here... I don't know. I don't think it's a good plan. Hey, pretty girls. Is your uncle Miguel home? I'm not going to pay for anything right now, David. Miguel, listen... So we stay here without light? What if the power fails? They'll get angry at me if I don't fix it. So I don't know. You decide. -So you're forcing me now... I'm not forcing you, Miguel. Not at all. My god. I've been looking for a generator... A semi-new one which I can get cheap. I can get one for 2000 euro. But I need to make a deposit first. So he's not selling it. I'm going around asking everyone to chip in. What do you think? Well, watch this... Read this... Here. When did you get this? -This morning. When are you leaving? -Next weekend. Next weekend? Dad, can I have a euro? -Yes. This one and the Alfa Romeo. I'll take these ones and that one. You're so jealous. You want the ones I choose. The ones I have, you want. -No, I just like the cars. OK, so I'll take this one, the Jeep. The Jeep. -The Jeep. For me the Nissan. For me this one. -For me the Seat. It's the Mini. Go to sleep! Damn you. Don't hit me. You'll be sorry, fucker. I'll break your chest. Get it off me. Get it off me! Don't be scared. Ready? -Yes. Come on. Your turn. -What do I do? Whatever you want. Come on! -Chin ups. With one hand. And three, and fast. -Three? Three. Come on. What? Yes? Yes. Yes, why? Who is it? Yes, tell me. What favour? I don't know. How much is it? I don't know. A few days? OK then. Better one of these days in the morning. OK. Bye. Who was that? -Nobody. It had to be somebody, right? -It wasn't important. Don't lie to me. Why did you walk away? -Nothing important, brother. Don't lie to me, something's up. -No. I've been hearing things, David. Leave me alone. -Look at me when I talk to you. Who was it? Tell me the truth. -It isn't important. It's nothing. -I heard something. Don't be stupid. Don't make me hit you. It was a girl. -You leave because of a girl? I was embarrassed. -Embarrassed for your older brother? So why did you say it was nobody? You could've just told me it was a girl. I don't know, I didn't want you to make fun of me like you always do. I never make fun of you. I joke with you. Just tell me the truth and say it's a girl. I was embarrassed. -Why? Do I know her? -No. Where's she from? -From Vallecas. What's her name? -Sandra. Sandra? Another one. Enough. If I call her, will she respond? Indarra? I don't think so. Indarra? Are you scared, Isa? -Yes. What are you scared of? -Giving birth. Scared of the labour or of the contractions? The labour. But also of the contractions. The more you relax, the better. I know, but I'm still scared. When you have contractions, breathe. Keep breathing the whole time. If you get nervous, and you're likely to, you'll only have more. Makes sense. But otherwise you should be fine. It stopped. It didn't. Again? I want. -Let me do it from here. Give me. -Me. Your side first. -Careful. Here. Let's see if we can put it up there. Should I climb on top of the bus? -Alright. You have to pull it back a little. Wait. What if it falls on the highway? -It won't, they are securing it well. What a shame. -It is. See you soon. Let's stay in touch. OK, my friend. -Take care. Take care and call me. -Yes. Bye, Brian. Take care. Take care of yourself, OK? We'll come to see you, don't worry. Can't wait. Bye, uncle David. -Bye, beautiful. Bye, Angel. -Make lot of friends there. Take care of everyone here. -We'll come visit you soon. Alright. Bye, everyone! Take care, everyone. -Bye. Good morning. -Morning. I'm Samuel, your computer help for today. Today we're going to submit a request for a house on the internet. It's very easy, it only takes three steps. First you'll have to fill in the personal data of your family members. From the youngest to the oldest. Samuel? -Yes. Come here for a moment. Tell me, what is it? It has given you an error... Let's see... Let's see... Look David, your ID card has expired. Mine? -Yes, yours. The system can't read an expired card. You'll have to renew your ID first. Without that you can't send the form. -I have to do it all over again? Yes, you'll have to do it all over again. OK, what a pity. Stop it. You're really going too far. Boys! Luisa Maria? He's not letting me work. David, you'll have to clean this. -Leave me alone. No, I'm not leaving you alone. I don't want to leave you alone. No, don't look at me like that. OK, teacher, OK, OK. -OK what? OK. Can you leave me alone? I'm working. -No. Pick up the brush. You can't leave it like that. What are you doing? Nothing, I just wanted to let you know that I need work and... OK, and when are you coming to pick up the... It's just that it's been here for a week and you knpw... Hello? You weirdo! -You can't take him on a bus. This one, with the bear on it. -Can I see? So cute! Should I get two? -Yes, do. Get these, but only if they're without alcohol. No. -No alcohol? I'll take two then. This one is for if she won't eat. 'Indarra, you have to eat!' 'Eat! For fuck sake.1 One, two, three. -One, two, three. One, two, three. You can count the diapers if you want. -It's OK. Thank you. Bye. See you later. -Bye. What's her problem? -I know, my god. Cars! -Look at those cars. Faster. You want to get in? You want to get in? Which one you want? The black one? -The black. This one? Come here, get in, one, two... OK, let's go. Baby! It's leaving. Get in, go on. - It stopped. Get in! No. How's it going, boys? You're so annoying. What are you doing? - PlayStation. No not for me. Can I have a smoke? - Yes, of course. Stop it. Just let me play. -Hurry up. Don't be such a pain. You're getting on my nerves. Jesus, come with me a moment. -Yes, wait a second, cousin. Just shoot him. -Don't be such a pain. Move it, Jesus, I'm in a hurry. What's up, cousin? -Can I borrow your bike? What for? -Can I have it or not? It's over there. -OK, thanks. Where are you going? I haven't seen you in a while. You're an ass. Don't talk to me anymore. Here you are. Thank you. -Thank you very much. Hello. -Hello. You need a haircut? -No, I'm looking for a job. Anya, he looks exactly like Raisal's son. -Wow, yes. How old are you? Exactly the same. -For sure. Can you imagine his son looking for work here? You live here? Your father's name is Raisal? -No. He looks a lot like him. I'm looking for work. We don't need anyone, sweetie. Can I leave my CV? -OK. Thank you. -Thank you, darling. Bye. Hello. -Hello. I'm looking for work. Hello, good evening. I want you to know that for me hairdressing is everything. I'm somebody wfio learns new things very quickly. I'll do anything, I can do anything. I'm... -Hello. Hello, good evening. -Hi, good evening. I'm neat... I just love hairdressing. It's my life. Bye. Good morning. Hello. -Hi. Hello. -Hi. How are you? Good, and you? -Same. Don't worry too much. I'm OK there. If I'd had problems, I'd have told you so. You're my mother. I wouldn't lie to you. But you know you live in very bad conditions there. Yes. -They're really bad. Yes, but I'll get a flat and then I'll leave. Yes... -In less than a year we'll leave that place. But in the meantime a lot can happen. Yes, but the same things could also happen here. You can't compare a flat with a slum. There you're cold. The house I live in has brick walls. Still, you'll be cold without any heating. Those are not conditions for a family to live in. You need a house with good conditions. You can't live like that. You like that type of life? I think I've never been a bad mom to you. I never wronged you. I never abandoned you. I've always wanted the best. You've also hurt your sister. Do you realize that? When you see your child growing up... Explain it to me. Tell me something. Why did you have to leave so young? For my granddaughters and grandsons. And for my daughter-in-law, so she can put on some more weight. Just a little, just a little. You want me fatter, right? He's finally asleep. Do you have an extra knife? -In there. What's the matter, Mana? -Everything's wrong. Samuel? Yes? -Can you come here for a moment? What's wrong? -Again the error warning. Did you renew your ID-card? It's the first thing I did. -OK, let's have a look. Can I see for a second? Let me take a quick look at it. -Sure David? -Tell me. You have a married son? -Yes. And he's over 18 and also has a child? -Yes. He can't be in your application. He has to apply for his own place. So apart from yours. He can't be included in your application. Why is that? He's an adult, married with a child, He has to apply for his own housing. He can't live in your house. -We've always lived together. Yes, but the flats in Madrid are not made for so many people to live together. So you have to live separately. But can't you arrange for us to at least live next to each other? For my grandson more than anything. Look, David, I can't do anything about that. Maybe the local government can. You can try to contact them to see if they can do something. This is useless. Be careful crossing. Wait. Wait. Hello you. How's everything? -Good. Did you tell the bus driver I'm picking you up? Yes. Are you hungry? -Yes. How are you? - Hello. Angel! - How are you? Boys, good afternoon. - Good afternoon. How are you? Here we are, going on as we can. - Hello. Look at you. How are you? Hi. -Hello. Angel! -What? Come on, go play outside. -Coming. Let's go. It smells like piss here. -You smell like piss. Good night. It's a nice spring evening, but it could be better if you win the lottery. The first price is for the numbers 11942 with extra numbers 2, 5 and 4. There are extra prizes for the numbers 3, 10,25, 35, 36 and 47. And the big prize of 12 million is for the numbers... 7,22, 38, 44, 47 and 49... with bonus number 42. Tomorrow I'll be back with the lottery prize of 28 million. Maybe you'll have luck... Granddad, I'm taking 20 euros, OK? -OK. Don't forget to put a note in there for when we count it. As usual, madam? Trim the ends and short here. Bye. -See you later. Is that Andrea, your granddaughter? -That's Andrea. Really? -Yes. Amazing! The last time I saw her, she was walking around in diapers. Yes, it's incredible. -It's amazing how time flies. Did you have a good time? -Yes, and you? I did too. I'm glad. -Me too. Even though the movie was bad. -Believe me, these moments are better. Yes. Like that. I don't know how to do this. Like that. -It's sticking to the bottom. That's why you stir. Don't stop moving it. Like this? -That's right. Here. The police has found car parts of more than 130 stolen cars. 42 persons have been arrested. The car parts were hidden in the slum 'La Canada Real'... With a shrewd administrative action they tried to deceive the police. Yes, tell me. I just talked to Antonio. It's near here. Where are you going? Move over, move away. I swear, brother, I have nothing to do... -Shut up, get the stuff. Get the gasoline. The gasoline. Get in. Don't just stand there. Hurry up. Stand back. You're not saying anything? Asshole. I'm angry, just like you But we can't blame or attack them... when we should really worry about what will happen when they relocate us. My wife is depressed not knowing where they'll send my eldest son. Because I've been living with them their whole life. We've never been separated. Now they're separating us without caring. My wife is depressed and I'm afraid it will kill her. And we only get two days to move before they tear down our homes. You don't get any time. -They just write: Tomorrow you have to leave. But how do you gather your whole life in two days? They do whatever they want, whatever they like. Good things will come out of this. But yes, you will also experience some bad things. In the beginning you will feel lonely and isolated... We're not saying it will be easy. Come on, you're finishing all the hot water. You'll see what happens if I run out of water. My god, stop shouting, I'm on the phone. -Then go out and talk there. Always the same. I gave you ten minutes. Go out and talk there. My god, here we go again. Dad, she's been in there half an hour. - He can't stop yelling. Angelines, get out of the bathroom. - I'm talking on the phone. Mom, can you say something? I'm going to kick in the door. They don't do anything. -My God, it's always the same. Can't you get up and do something? You're not getting up? My god, it's always the same. I have to do everything. You could have done something. I can't have five minutes to myself. I'm still getting ready and you're just lying there. You can't even get angry at them or anything. Your five minutes to yourself are not five minutes. You take two hours. I can lay here because I do need five minutes. Of course. -Two hours, you need. No, I'm taking care of you. I lay your clothes out. Only my clothes, but... -Yes, so you... Hello? Does David Gabarre live here? -What? Does David Gabarre live here? Whether my father lives here? -Yes Yes, why? Can you ask him to come? Dad. -Wait. And I don't work? -I was talking about work for tomorrow. I work all day as well. -Dad? There are two people at the gate. -What? What do you mean? Thank you. -No problem. Look, come. -He has to get his balloon letters. Come, help your daddy. -Go help him. Help me. Careful it won't fall. It's falling. -Hold it tight. Help me. Go on. Help me, put it in there. Quick. Let's go inside to get more things. Is that ready? -No, can't you see I'm still putting stuff in? You're taking your time. -What can I do? Take the other stuff. The microwave? -Yes. You can take it outside. Fuck off. What more? -Take the lamp down. The lamp as well? -Yes. There's already a lot there. I'll see. Mom? -What? Come here for a second, please. What? -What should I do with all this? It's never going to fit in there. -It will fit. If you fold it up... there's no reason it won't fit. -Do we have another box? No. But it will all fit in one, Angelines. And where do I leave the bags? -Put them in the hallway. David and Angelo will put it in the car. Come on, hurry up. OK. -It's late already. Can you? -Yes. David? David? My god. What have you done? Why are you crying? Because of the TV? We can buy another one. Don't worry about it. What? Come, my love. Look at me. It's OK. Maria? -What? Hurry up. We're going. -I'm coming. Hurry up. Four with chicken. -Look. Who's got the chicken? -So good, so good. All for me. I'll leave them here. Mom? Mom? -Mana? Mom? Mom? That cola is for me. Those are the three Big Macs. -That cola is for me. That Big Mac is mine. -Here's one Big Mac. Maria, your hamburger. That's another Big Mac.
