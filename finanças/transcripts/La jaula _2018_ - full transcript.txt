The Trap Hi! Leave your message. Gerardo, where are you? We’re on our way to your apartment, if you are there please don’t leave. And answer your cell phone, we’re really worried about you, son. Turn here to the right. How’re you holding up? Do you have cigarettes on you? You don't smoke. Do you or don’t you? Where are the keys? Do you remember how to get there? I called the grocery store and they told me that there’s running water but no light... so they’re going to leave a lantern by the door. They’ll fix the rest for you tomorrow. Thank you. What should I tell them if they ask about you? That you don’t know anything. I told you we weren’t going to be alone. Do you happen to know if the phone works? I don’t know m’am, but we can check the line for you. Good. Please be careful, that headboard was a gift. Can you go to the end of the hall and make a right? Thanks. Gerardo! Gerardo! Gerardo! Don’t go too far ok? It’s dangerous. Where were you? - Exploring. - Oh yeah, right! My Little Red Riding Hood! Are you sure you don’t want to have dinner? We’re going to go grocery shopping tomorrow. - What are you reading? - A story. Let me see. What story? It’s cool. Don’t stay up too late, ok? They’re going to kill him. - Who? - The deer. No. It ́s just a story. But they do kill them, don’t they? No. Are you sure? I ́m sure. Don't be too long. Mom! Mom! The phone is ringing! Who is it? Sorry. I need the key to the shed so I can change the fuses. Morning. Good morning. I would have liked to have them ready yesterday, but... ...I didn’t have the key to that lock. I’ll get out of your way. I’ll leave the keys on the table. Ok, thanks. What are you looking at, asshole? Motherfucker. Good morning. Good morning. I have some things ready for you, so you’ll be set for a while. I’m Matías. At your service. Felipe. Ok... ...I ́ll go get the stuff... ...won ́t be long. That's a good rifle. What about this one? That’s a spark shotgun, but no one uses it anymore. It’s just there for show. And what do you hunt with this? Rabbits... It used to be, you could pretty much hunt anything around here... ...wolves, deer... ...but now they’re up in the mountains. How much? Can you shoot, sir? Here, here... ...place the butt carefully on you shoulder... ...there you go. Now breath normally... ...trust the sight... ...and go for it. That's it, Mr. Felipe. This one still has a few good shots in it... ...of course, if you wanted to bring down something bigger, that thing would only piss it off. Is this one for sale? I ́ll tell you what, sir... ...you can borrow it. That way I’m sponsor to your first kill... ...you just pay for the ammunition and we’re even... ...however, if you want to hunt... ...you can also use a trap. Fucking pussy. Silence, children... ...quiet, please. This is Gerardo... ...he ́ll be joining us from now on... ...so I do hope you'll help him catch up... ...will you do that? Yes! Gerardo, you can sit on the desk by the window. Ávila Morales Enrique.... ...Álvarez López Fernanda... He's really weird, right? He never speaks or anything. And the other day, he peed his pants. I stole it from my sister. Those are huge! I'm looking at it! Let me see! Wow! You're so horny! Busybodies... ...what about you, asshole? He's talking to you, asshole. What is it, do you also want to look at naked chicks? He's a sissy for sure... Go away already you fucking midget, unless you want me to smash your face in! And he'll break it good. Did you see that? Oh wow, she's hot. That one's hot. You have to eat all of it, ok? How was your first day? Ok. Did you make any friends? One. Soon you’ll have as many as you did in the city... ...you ́ll see. When you’re done with the vegetables, will you help me out with something? Will you go to the neighbors’ and ask to borrow a lighter? To the neighbors? Yes. To the neighbors... ...it ́s next door, lazy. Good afternoon! Good afternoon! Hello? Hello? What are you doing here? My mom asked to borrow a lighter. What's your name? Gerardo. You’ll find a bunch of lighters in the dining room table. Mom! He likes carrots. What's his name? So why don't you take him home? He wouldn't like my home... ...but you can take it to yours if you want... ...he ́ll fit in your backpack. He wouldn't like mine either. Have you ever seen a naked girl? I saw my neighbor. So what are you going to give her? I don ́t know. We ́d better go. Hey pussy! Gerardo... ...look at me. Felipe told me he fell down and hit his mouth with some stones. Is that true? What happened to Felipe? What he said. He fell. Because if someone did something to him, it’s better that I know... ...so it won't happen again... ...don ́t you think? So? He fell. I saw him. Good... ...he ́s also good... ...yeah, they only just installed the phone... ...he ́s asleep... ...no, don't worry about it, we don't need it... ...nothing will happen to us... ...yes, I have it in my drawer... I don't want to talk about it... ...I ́ll tell him... ...good night. Where are you going? Can I go play? Just don't go too far... ...come here... ...what ́s the backpack for? To explore. To explore. I ́ll be back in a bit. Come here. Mom, let me go! Don't be long! Hello? Hello? Hello? Motherfucker. What are you looking at, asshole? Where are you? Come out, asshole! You like to watch, right, asshole? Do you like to watch, asshole? Shut up he's just a child! - I asked if you liked to watch! - Shut up already! You're an idiot. And you're a whore. What are you doing here? You scared me. - My brother told me you were here. - You have no reason to be here. We need to talk. I don ́t need to talk. I won't leave until you listen to me. I don't want to listen to you. Why did you cover all the mirrors? Are you ok? I'm the way I need to be. You have no idea how I've felt after what happened... ...I haven't even been able to sleep. I've slept just fine. It ́s only fair that you're angry. What the fuck makes you think I'm angry? I want to explain either way. I don't need an explanation. Even so, I want you to know why I did it. Are you deaf? Why do you have a rifle? I took up hunting. But you don't know anything about that. I know enough. My dad used to hunt as well. Your dad is an asshole. Why don't we go get a cup of coffee when you're back in town? Good morning. Morning. How ́s it going with the rabbit? It ́s a clever animal. Want to try the trap? Well find it... ...you never know when you're going to need this kind of stuff. How long since you've used it? Its been a while... ...but that thing still works. Here it is! Have you caught any rabbits with that thing? It is made for rabbits. What do I have to do? You have to put out bait for the rabbit... ...wait a second. I ́ll go get it. Mom, let's go! Mom! Mom! Mom! Coming! Did you wake up very early? Honey? What's wrong? I don't like it when you talk to him. That's none of your business, Gerardo. Does it hurt? Wait, you're running too fast! What are you doing, pussies? Leave us alone. Leave us alone! What's wrong with you? Put down the stone. On your knees. On your knees! Say you're sorry. Say you're sorry! Sorry. Do you like to watch, asshole? Where are you? Come out, asshole! Sit down, please. Good afternoon. Do you know why you're here? I'm sorry, but you can ́t smoke here. Gerardo... ...please wait in the hall. This is a very serious issue... ...we ́re worried about your son, of course... ...but the fact that something like this has happened... ...and with a fire weapon no less... ...it puts every student at risk. This sort of thing has never happened at this school... ...at least not since I've been the principal... ...and I can ́t allow for it to ever happen again... ...do you understand? I can’t even begin to comprehend how a child could have access to a weapon... ...and bring it to school. The child is not to blame... ...the adult is. You, in this case. How can you have a gun? Good morning. Good morning. You're up early. A bit. Aren't you going to ask me how it went? I don't need to ask, I know. I'm guessing you won't be back soon. You guessed right. Thanks for everything. Say, Mr. Felipe... ...I found something in the woods a couple of days ago... ...I thought I ́d ask... ...is it yours? My name is not Felipe... ...my name is Gerardo.
