Way back then, my world was torn apart. Men. When they want to get a wife. They become fearless and act without mercy. Fucking asshole. Here. Your turn to dance. Don't bother my wife. Annoying. Just bug off. What an asshole. Yes of course! This fucking asshole is screwing my wife! We even have a child that looks like you. Asshole. Shitty asshole! Just have a seat. What a fucking asshole. My goodness! There is a secret hidden. A murder. A murder is near. You Kupak are the cause of all this. You asshole! You don't share food. Aulla. Move over there. You are murderers. You keep food to yourselves. You're having sex with our women. You have to leave our camp. Get out of here! Let's go. Assholes! Let's get back to the party, and rid ourselves of evil. He never hunts and thinks he is a leader! What an asshole. Did you see my lover's husband? He thinks he's a big man now. Angutii, your dad's arriving. We came to our favourite ice crack. When my son stood at the seal breathing hole, I looked back at him and he harpooned a seal. I wasn't far away, what a joy it was to see. Wonderful, a cup of tea. Are you a man now? Ready to get a wife? Son, put your seal aside to thaw out. In the morning we'll have a wonderful meal. These are cooked. Delicious parts are for women. For men too. Here it is, you want some? Yes of course. You're a seal hunter now. Have a piece before it's gone. Delicious. You've been cooking them for a while? Yes, they are delicious now. Is your sister eating? Yes of course. Is it good? Is that how you will act, when you have a husband? Always pouting? What about you? I was like you when I started sewing, you will learn. Let me see it. Let me show you. This is how you sew. Son. Give me that stone. Move aside. Spirit Apisaaq. Are you near? Apisaaaq. Are you near? Are there any animals nearby? Is it ptarmigan? No. Is it a rabbit? No. Is it a caribou? Is it south of us? No. Is it to the east? Oh yes! That's great. Apisaaq. Thank you as always! That's wonderful. Son, return the stone back. Son. Go hunt them. They're that way. Yes, we will. Go with my grandson. Are our dogs full? - Yes. Yes, that's wonderful. Our dogs will be happy on the hunt. Father I want to come too! Father! I want to come. Father! I want to come. There they are. Do you see them? Where? Up above that boulder. Yes. There. I can see them now. We only have three bullets left. I'll have to aim right and get two caribou with one shot. Quiet the dogs while I stalk them. Guard the dogs. Kupak. Kupak. Where are we trying to go? Look, we're running out of food. Do you know where you are going? What the fuck! I know exactly where I am going. You think I can't smell women from miles away? Really. Ahh. You still remember how women smell? Not me. The four of us have been together too long. Asshole. Timauti, make some tea. Let's have tea and eat. Fucking dog. Whack him. Have some food. Did you hear that? - Yes I told you there's a woman somewhere. Let us pack up, now. Hurry up. Pack up the food. Come, have something to eat. I think I heard the sound of dogs. Maybe they got caribou? If they did, they won't be back tonight. They will be back tomorrow. Come sit and eat, tomorrow you will have caribou meat. Grandmother. Grandmother. - What? Tell me a story. Once upon a time grandmother and grandchild... hear something... rumbling... knocking noise. Grandmother. What? - Stay awake. Finish the story. Grandmother said: "maybe rabbits are stampeding". It was Indians running away. Go back to your place. Polar bear. It's a bear! A bear! Give me your son. - No. I said give me your son! - No. I won't give him to you! Keep away. Don't you dare. Don't take him. Don't! You're coming with me. - We're not coming. What happened here? It was bad. What happened? Men came. Daughter in-law, granddaughter, were taken away. Little grandson, not sure? Don't know what happened. Here. This will be your helping spirit. The loon. You call three times. Shout Kalluliik. Follow them. Son. Son. What kind of people can do this? Son. What kind of people can do this! Kalluliik. Kalluliik. Kalluliik. Come and help me now. They went that way. Come on! Tulimaaq. Mush the dogs. Here. What's wrong with you? What the fuck. I have a low tone in my ear. It's bad news. Tulimaaq, you go back. Go see if we are being followed. We'll make camp and wait, behind that hill. Are you sure? I don't think we are being followed. - Make camp if you have to. Take one of Aulla's dogs. What? One of my dogs? What about your dog? No, from your team. Come, come. Aulla. Get your new wife. Oh, you're close. Give me a cup of tea, dear. You're not going to dry your clothes, dear? Give me a cup of tea, dear. We're not moving. Son. When did we stop? Let's eat a bit. Someone is coming. One of them. Kupak! Aulla! Your women are running. What? - Look. Aulla. Your new wife. Get off. Get the fuck away from me. Come with me. - No. Come. - No. I don't want to be with you. Be nice. - No. Come on. They passed just last night. Watch the dogs, I'm going to scope around. Untangle the lines. Come on. - No. Don't do this. Come on. - No. Leave me alone. Get away from me. He's looking back at me. There they are. There's my wife. They're breaking camp. Aulla. He's following us. Timauti, get ready. Kalluliik. Kalluliik. Kalluliik. Help me now. You go that way. I'll go this way. - Why that way? Just go. Why not you? - You just go. That way. Son. Follow the trail, in between there. Me alone? - You can do it. I'll meet you behind the hill. You can do it, just like hunting caribou. Where is your mother? How many are there? Follow my footsteps and hide behind the ridge. Your sister is behind the ridge. Go meet her. Wife. Wife. Ailla! Just run away. Take your dogs and run. Run while you can. Shoot me. I'll shoot you! - You're out of bullets. I'm going to shoot you. Run while you can. Your wife and daughter are mine. - Never. Your wife is mine. - Never! Your wife and daughter are mine. My love. Daughter. Siku, you can come out now. Come out now. Even though you go through hard times, never give up.
