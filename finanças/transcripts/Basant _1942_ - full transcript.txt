Manager says I can't sing. His daughter says, nor will I ever learn. - What has the daughter to do with this? - Why not? She's the diva of the theater. Her word counts. - Witch! - Hey. What are you doing? I've told you, you're not fit to act on stage. Too young. And we need women. Send Miss Kanta in. Please, Miss. We are very poor. Just hear me sing. You'll like it. What does 'liking' have to do with it? We can't employ you. - Please, Miss. - Listen. Stop being stubborn. Go home. Tell your parents to send you to school. Why would I come here if I had parents? What can I do? We aren't doing charity here. But I haven't come for charity. I want a job. I could be an employee among so many. Yes, they all say that. Run along. Go! If not mine, what about my sister's song? - Sister? - Yes! I can fetch her. She works as a servant. She's better off there. Send Miss Kanta in. My sister's a great singer. - Better than me. - Just go. - Okay. Wait. Take. Eat something. I came for a job, not to beg. Thanks. - Are you Miss Kanta? - Yes. - Please sit down. - Thank you. Listen! I've gone through what you've just done. Somehow let the boss hear you sing. - Owner? - Yes. Babu Janaki Prasad. He employed me. - Do you work here? - Yes. He's unwell these days, and they are ruling. Here's his address. And... just be careful. He's very short tempered. - But he's very kindhearted. Go now. - Thanks. Listen. If possible, take your sister along. If he likes your singing, your fortune will turn. Very well. Thank you. Namaste. Who? - Babul? Why did you come here? - Sister. - I have great news. - Uma, what was that noise? - Nothing. A dog came in. - What? Quiet. Out! Out! I've told you not to come here. - Go. What if Babuji comes? - Let him. I've come to take you away. - Take me away? - Yes. To meet the owner of the theater. If he likes us, we'll get the job at once. And then, ah ha! Stop blabbering. A job in the theater? Have you gone mad? - Go away. - Uma. Who are you talking to? No one. Go away. Quickly. Uma. I heard voices. - I'm sure someone was here. - No. No one. How can that be? You're lying. Who was it? Speak. I said there was no one. Liar! I'm sure it was your...! Another word about my sister... you'll regret it. Understand? So you are the dog? - Get out. - Don't curse. I've come to take my sister. Have you gone mad? I won't go. Babuji, please forgive. - He's young. - That's enough. Since your father died I've looked after you for 2 years. And your brother threatens me? Even animals are grateful for favors. - But you! - What have you done? She toils the whole day. And gets a pittance. - And they you say... - Will you be quiet Babul? Babuji, don't pay any attention to him. - He's naive, and talks nonsense. - He can do that at home. Go! You too. - Babuji. - No. I don't need you here. Get lost. What have you done, Babul? Now what? Don't worry. We'll get a job at the theater. You'll see. Yes, jobs grow on trees. Just reach out and pluck. You'll starve. But we won't come to you. - Take your wage, sister. - What wage? - You won't get a cent. - Is that so? Not a cent? Take out the money. Come on! Police! Out with her money. Be quick. Hurry! One more. - Namaste. - Wait you scoundrel. Oh Ramu, Nathu run, you good for nothing. This is his house. Wait, I'll go first. I'm a bit scared. It's of no use now. - We have to do something now. - Yes, sister. No. I've told you many times. Earn if you want money. - Don't bother me. - But, brother. - Go away. See, If I go away... I won't return. Remember. Fine. Good riddance. Just think. No one gives me a job. - Is it my fault? - No, mine. Listen. Either look for a job... or look after my theater. Otherwise you're not welcome here. Understand? I've said this several times... I don't like working in the theater. Don't like working there... but love to spend money from the theater. Lazy lout. Out of my sight. - You didn't understand, brother. - That's all. I won't hear another word. Go away. - You're always... - Go, or else! Let's go Babul. We shouldn't go in here. Look at his state. Yes. Listen. - Excuse me. Who are you? - She's my sister. We wanted to work in the theater. Then go, and meet him. No, no. Look what's become of you. Wonder what'll become of us. - Right, Babul? - Yes, sister. I see. Come with me, I'll take you. Excuse us. We don't want to end up like you. No, no. He's very good with others. He's just like a coconut. Hard on the outside... and soft on the inside. See for yourself. - Excuse us. - Let's go, and see, sister. Yes. You've nothing to lose. Only to gain. And... me too. You too? How? It's like this. He'd like me to work in his theater. But I don't. Then why take us to him? Because... this way I do something for him. And he'll be happy with me. Oh, all this concern is for yourself? - Let's go, Babul. - You've got it wrong, Laxmi Devi. I'm not Laxmi. My name's Uma. Uma Devi. Help me please. You'll gain too. Come on sister. Let's see. - But your brother? - I told you... he's a coconut. Like a coconut. Come. What's with you? Me? Nothing. - Don't be afraid. - We aren't. You are. Me? Not at all. Not at all. Wait here. - Brother. - You're here again? Don't shout. They're outside. What're you saying? Who's outside? Brother, I have a gift for you. Just see them, once. Then judge me. Be more specific. What should I see? - A pair of birds. - Birds?! I don't want any birds. Go away. See them. Then decide. - Here, take. - These? - Yes. They want a job in your theater. They were flying away, but I caught them. What's your name? Uma. And yours? Babul. Where do you live? At present we don't have any place. Have you worked before? Yes, at Babu Kundanlal's. At Babu Kundanlal's? - As what? - I... was a servant there. Have you danced and sung before? No, I haven't. But she sings very well, brother. Hear her. Your theater will profit, believe me. Have you heard her sing? No, but they say so. I knew it. Take them away. Hear them once. I had to beg them to come. Do as I say. Don't make me angry. Go. Hard on the outside... soft on the inside. Like a coconut. Come Babul. Now I'm angry. Listen. Come with me. Stand in front of the house and sing. And loudly, to damage his eardrums. Do you think we're beggars? No. He doesn't oblige so he'll be forced to listen. - That's it. - The idea is good, sister. Do what you want. I'm going back to Babuji. Your brother's more sensible than you. - Come on. I might lose my temper. - Leave me. No. Come on. You can have your lofty palaces We love our lanes But even in your palaces you don't find peace Those sleeping in the lanes on sheets of sorrow... are the ones who enjoy and revel in their dreams You are bewitched with gold and silver Our heart is our wealth You might consider our tears as water from the eyes For us they are strings of pearls Stop this. Stop. Why should we? Carry on. Aren't you ashamed? There's a crowd here. You don't value my respect? You don't value mine either. Whatever I do is of no value. Yes, begin. You are bewitched with gold and silver Our heart is our wealth You might consider our tears as water from the eyes For us they are strings of pearls We love our lanes Stop it, Nirmal. First tell me, can they come in? Yes. And sing for you? Yes. - Now stop this mockery. - Come. So, shall we begin? - What? - Won't you hear them sing? No, no. You create a problem everyday. Not everyday. - Only sometimes. - Quiet! Stupid. We love our lanes. Meena, is your father there? I want to talk to him. Yes, it's me. Listen. There's a girl and boy here. They're good. So you like them, brother? Didn't I say so? Now can I stay here? Get lost. Idiot. What did you say? Not you. I said that to Nirmal. Listen. Come here with Meena at once. I want them on the stage today. Yes, tonight. Just come. You'll be on stage tonight. - Both. - Let go. Someone might see. I'm sorry. Okay... wait here. Manager and Meena Devi are coming. Bhaiya'll make it work. Manager and Meena Devi? - Coming here? - Yes. Brother's called them. - Why? What happened? - Nothing. Nothing. Who's Meena Devi? A star in Bhaiya's theater. She stays on the top floor. I'll leave now. Meet you at the theater. Why are you leaving? You don't know, she scares me. I keep my distance. Why? - I'll tell you later. - Nirmal Babu. Stay here. She might ask us to go. Not in the presence of bhaiya. So, see you at the theater. Didi, sit here. - I'll be back. - No. I'll be all alone. - I'll be back soon. - No. Don't go. It's like this. (A sign of needing to go to the bathroom.) - Namaste, Nirmal babu. - Oh, Dalip. Either you never come here, or... you creep in like a thief. - Don't shout. - What's the matter? Listen. Where is she? - Who? Meena Devi? - No. No. She shouldn't know I'm here. - Is she anywhere near? - Don't worry. - She's in her room. - Alright. - Where's the new actress. - Uma Devi? The one... - With a brother? Yes? - Yes. - I see! - What? - Nothing. She's in that room. - Namaste Nirmal babu. - Namaste. - What happened? - Nothing. Please leave. With such difficulty I got you this job. Now you treat me like this? Don't get me wrong. It wasn't an insult. Were you joking? I just want to check your costume. No. I can't come out. - Why? - I'm unable to say. - Just leave. - What's the matter with you? Don't come in. - Go away. - I'm sorry. Hello. Nirmal? - Why are you running away? - Not at all... I'm not. I came here by mistake. Anyway, whether by mistake or on purpose... - at least you came. - Yes, yes. - But I... - I'm so happy to see you here. Come let's chat. No, I've a lot to do. Work? You? Good joke. Come, sit down. - I won't let you go. - Please understand. I... - really have important work. - Important? What can it be? - Oh. With that new girl? - Yes. So that's why you came here? Has he gone? - Oh. - Why? What happened? Nothing. Go get dressed quickly. Shameless. Dearest, speak softly, someone will hear you Mother-in-law is sleeping inside and sister-in-law, outside I feel shy, please open the door softly No one's sleeping or awake. Stop making excuses Only we are aware of these late hours Part your veil Speak softly Some one will see You've got your salary today You've bought neither any sarees nor dupattas - I've brought something special. - What? - 2 packets for 9 annas. - What? Of what? Of Spring. - Spring? - Yes. Seeing it, our hearts will beat Speak softly. Someone will hear you Come here. It's your turn now. Don't get nervous. Just stand there and start singing. Yes, get out there - Go on. - I'm feeling nervous. - Go sister. - I knew she'd be a problem. - Shut up. Go sister. Don't be afraid. - Come on. Sing, sister. - Shall I open the curtains? - Start. - She'll be our downfall. Shut up. - What's the matter? - Please sing. A small world A small world in my little heart Small houses, a small courtyard, and a small garden There's a small world in my small heart In this garden flowers of hope bloom My dreams are swinging on... a swing with ropes of dedication Monsoons make me laugh, then cry The koel is chirping and celebrating It wakes me up This small world with its small matters Short days and short nights And the age is small too A small world in my little heart Very good. Listen. Get changed, and go home. Certainly not. Who are you to fire her? Who me? I'll tell you. Go on. Get changed. I'll be right back. Yes, it's me. What happened? - What? - Both were disgraceful. They are useless. I'd warned you. Now the people are jeering. They're jeering? What are you saying? No. There's no need for me to come. Do what you think is right. I mean... if they're no good, fire them. I've already done that. You know I don't do things by half. Give it to me. Hello. Bhaiya? What's it? No, I can't keep them. - Don't pester me. - But it's very late. They have nowhere to go. It was her first time and she was nervous. - This will be unkind. - What can I do? What? You're bringing them here? Of course. Give them shelter. Teach them. You've made many stars. Now it's their turn. - I'm bringing them. - You devil. You won't listen. Everyday... you create some problem for me. - Idiot. - Not everyday, brother. Only sometimes. So? My word carries weight too. Uma Devi? Babul? - They've gone. - Where? - How should I know? Let them go. Dalip, did you see Uma Devi and Babul leave? Yes, they went that way. I tried to stop them, but they wouldn't. - What now, didi? - We'll carry on walking till morning. Babul, wait. Where're you going? Nowhere. We're just walking aimlessly. That's crazy. Bhaiya's asked both to come home. What's the use? We're useless. You've done a lot for us. We're grateful to you. I beg you to come. Don't ruin everything. Don't spoil the plan. Come on Babul. I gave you a chance, but you failed. I can't do more. Give me another chance Janaki babu. Nirmal babu said I must try again... till I succeed. You can try all your life but won't succeed. - Go away. - Have mercy please. We're homeless. Nowhere to go. Go away. Monsoons have come to make one laugh... and weep Monsoon makes one laugh and cry The koel (cuckoo) is celebrating... morning through evening Small world in my little heart Small things of a small world Short days and short nights And young age A small world in my little heart - What is it, Uma Devi? - Nothing. I can't sleep. ls Babul awake? He's sleeping in that room. - Why? - I've been wanting to speak with him. - I'm feeling disturbed. - Oh. Let Babul sleep. We can talk on the verandah outside. If you approve, of course. Let it be. I'll go upstairs. - I don't want to trouble you. - No, no. Not at all. Sit out there, and you'll feel better. Such a pleasant night. No? Moonlight, shining stars! It all looks so beautiful. - Why did you smile? - Just like that. No, please tell me. - Do thousands of stars shine in moonlight? - What? You are right. Lovely moonlight! Lovely pair! Sweet talk. Oh ho. - Great! - What are you saying Meena? - She was feeling restless, and... - Yes. I know. I understand. Okay, I'll go now. Thank you. Don't be deceived, babuji. But if so, then remember... there's water in the sea, as well as stones. Wonderful! What are you doing here? Nothing. You asked her to wait here. I thought she's alone here, so... Uma. I've brought these clothes for you. Don't wear such clothes. You go out and meet people. Wear good clothes. Do you like them? - Very much. Thank you. - Okay. Change your clothes and go to the theater. - You might be late for rehearsals. - Alright. Bhaiya. They don't rehearse properly in the theater. She can rehearse at home. - No, who'll teach her here? - Why? You're here. You've taught so many. - No, I'm not well. - I'll help you. She's learned a lot already. You can teach her the rest. But how? I'll show you. Sit there and watch. My heart, make a world of your own Far away where no one can reach Where no one will sing sad songs Let love quietly enter the eyes Decorate the nights with dreams Let magic play in every home... where those who sulk can go They will be helped to cheer up My heart make a world of your own No, this won't work. Waste of time teaching songs. Why? Didn't you like it? I don't have to give a reason for everything. Just do as I say. Your wish. - Did something happen? - No, no. Sometimes even I don't understand bhaiya's moods. Anyway. Please get dressed quickly. - What are you doing here? - Waiting for you. I've something to say to you. - What? - Why are you teasing me like this? Upsetting you? Means? You know everything. Don't talk nonsense, Meena. It wasn't nonsense ten years ago. Ten years ago you were an innocent little girl. And now... - I don't know what to say. - Don't humiliate me so. My heart's breaking. You know how much I love you. That's what the problem is. Why don't you just say you love that girl. What? What did you say? You love her. That's why you're doing so much for her. You want to marry her. But I won't let it happen. I'll kill myself. I'll take poison. Slow down, slow down. Don't be in a hurry. I'm feeling dizzy. Do what you like. But first let me go from here. Don't go Nirmal. I know you very well. Get up. Or else here's your head... and here's a jug of cold water. No, no. Well done. Okay, now go and get yourself smelling salts. You'll be okay. Rascal. - What happened. - Meena is jealous. She says I love you. I want to marry you. I think she's right. Come. What are you thinking? - Why did you do this needlessly? - What? Why'd you bring me here instead of the theater? What must I say? The question is amazing. But are you happy to come here? I've never been so happy. Really? Why are you so happy? What must I say? The question is amazing. Great! Beating me with my own words. - What will happen now? - Why? What happened? That you and I came here like this. I'm afraid. Why afraid? It'll work once I tell bhaiya. - What will you say? - That we... I mean, we want to get married. Uma. Just you and me. No problems. No worries. You've suffered a lot. Yes, now you don't have to work. - It's my responsibility, now. - No, no. I won't burden you. Yes, it weighs you down. Really Uma... I'll be happy to carry this burden. My heart knows. - Honestly? - As much... as you're Uma. And I... arre. - What happened? - I've forgotten my name. Your name? What do I know? Caught you! - What happened? - A thorn, I think. - Let me see. - No. I'll remove it myself. You can't see the underside. Let me. - No. Leave it. - Why? Feeling shy. A thorn in your foot... shyness in your eyes. 'No' on your tongue... and 'yes' in your heart. Come, let me. Be quick. It takes time to take out such a big thorn. Look. Go to your bush. Never again get entangled in a beauty's foot. Come. Oh, what are you doing? Nothing. Come here. - Why? - Come on. Let me touch your feet. I don't have a thorn in my foot. But my foot had. Come. I can't walk. I can't walk my dear, because of a thorn in my foot The thorn has become a friend and has come to my street One pierces the body... the other mocks She goes to pick flowers but is afraid of the thorns How will the crazy one find happiness when she's afraid of sorrow? Come, beloved, let's hold hands and walk together There are thorns in every lane which will turn to flower buds Never again say that you can't tread on the path My dear I can't walk because of the thorn Where were you, didi? You didn't go to the theater for rehearsals. I just went for a walk with Nirmal babu. Why did you do that? Janaki babu's very angry. He might do something. Don't worry. I'll see to it. Come. Oh, you've come back? I have to say something. - I too have to tell you something. - Quiet! - No one asked you. - But... - Be quiet. Don't interfere in everything. Come. - Did you say anything to bhaiya? - Who, I? Why should I? Doesn't he have eyes? Uma, Uma Rani, Uma Devi, Uma Kumari, etc. Would you like to listen? For entertainment? No. Do you mind... if I sing? No. What was my fault that drove you away... my dear heart? The light of my eyes You spread the essence of your love in my street You made my heart beat What punishment is this? Why this distance, my dear? The others drank and started staggering I too drank, but was not filled with any sublime emotion Serve me in a way that I go on drinking That I can live and get completely drunk What did I do to drive you away... my dear heart? The light of my eyes What is my fault? - Liked it? - Yes, very much. - Happy? - Yes, very much. - What happened? - Nothing. All is well. I've apologized to Janaki babu. And promised to rehearse everyday. And to work hard. This is right. - Did you tell him about us? - No. - I'll tell him. - No, not now. - Why not? - He's in a bad mood right now. He might turn us out. So what? I'll find another place. I'm not alone. I have Babul. And if you don't find a place, then? - Don't worry about that. - No, no. - I won't let you do that for me. - Why not? You're not yet acquainted with trouble. You don't know about wandering helplessly. What hunger and thirst is. - I'm used to it. - Alright. Whatever you say. Don't worry. I didn't hear anything. See, I've my fingers in my ears. - Are you angry? - No. I didn't want to hurt you. Look at me. Look at me. When I first came here... it was never my aim to work. You know you insisted. You wanted me to become a big star. I know. So why give people a chance to mock? Manager and Meena are waiting for this moment. You want to give it to them? - No. - Then don't stop me. We should finish what we started. Both of us should. That's fine. But I fear it will interfere with our lives. Never. I'll leave it whenever you say. But not right now. Once you're in it, you can't come out. Why not? I'll quit tomorrow if you get a job. Promise. Till then we have to be patient. But my heart doesn't agree. This job isn't for you. Earlier you didn't think so. Then you were looking for a job. I wanted to help you. Things have changed now. I feel bad that... my wife has to... work in the theater or anywhere else. It's only a matter of time. You'll certainly find a job somewhere. - Alright. - I knew you'd understand. But now you too have to do something. I'll work. You'll look for work. - Okay? - Alright. My lady, is your raja willing to let you become a star? - Sure. - How many days will it take? - Tell me. - Who knows? But to shut your mouth, I'll have to become one. Do something father. If Uma succeeds today... - no one will want me again. - What can I do? - I can't change anything. - Nothing at all? Or you don't want to? What? No. I'd do my best for you. Janaki babu controls everything now. Don't know why? It's not even a month... and today she's on stage. Shameless. She'll ruin my life's efforts. Don't just sit father. Do something. What? Give me a plan. I can't think of any. There must be a way. Yes! - Dalip, will you do something for me? - What? If you don't I'll be ruined, Dalip. What can it be? If Uma succeeds today... I'll be ruined. Can you see that? I helped you to find your feet here. Help me today. - But to help you... - I'll give you anything. - 200, 500. - What must I do? Get some men. Give them tickets, and money. When Uma finishes... they must jeer... and throw rotten eggs, tomatoes, shoes... - onto the stage. Okay? - Yes. Rotten eggs, tomatoes... shoes. That's all? Yes. Will you do it? If you say so. But... - Yes? - You are clever... - to come to me. - Ain't I? Here, take. I have only Rs50 here. I'll give you the rest later. Now I feel relief. Just wait and see our work. Then feel the relief. It'll be special. Don't worry. Spring has arrived friend, and longing has ended. The woods are blooming The buds have silently lifted their veils... and wish to hear the humming of the bees The heart's desire reflects the color of the mustard flowers Eyes enjoy playing Holi... with their pink color of intoxication Lovers are dancing in the groves among trees With their arms around each other... celebrating the moment of being together The spring has arrived, friends, and longing has ended The woods are blooming Uma? Are you crying? - What happened? - Nothing Janaki babu. I'm very happy. I'm grateful to you. My happiness is immeasurable. This's nothing. You have to achieve much more. I expect a lot from you. - And you're crying? - I'm not crying. - I'm very happy. - Alright. Sit down. - Wipe away your tears. - Didi! Here you are. Oh didi, I can't tell you... - What to say... - No bhaiya. - You brought me here. - No, it's due to your hard work, didi. - Oh, I'm so happy today. - Okay Babul. Now please leave. - Let her rest a while. - Yes. Okay. - If you need me, call me. - Yes. No one can go in. Babuji's orders. You are successful. Your life is now for others. For those... who come here to see and applaud your work. You're theirs now. Uma, I've brought something for you. Look. - There was no need. - I understand its need. Uma, you look very pretty. Take it. I wish I... - What Janaki babu? - Nothing. Just like that. Please tell me. Please. I wanted to say that... Forget it. Let it be. What is it, Janaki babu. Say it. If you insist. But don't get me wrong. Today I thought... if you had come some years earlier... I'd have married you. - You didn't mind that? - No. Janaki babu, can you take me home? - I'm very tired. - Sure. Come. Oh, where were you? I've been waiting so long to congratulate you. - Thank you. - She was great today, wasn't she? No words. Oh, how beautiful. Must be from babuji. First success is always marked by a gift from babuji. He gave me this. Do you remember? Yes. Uma, go and change. Let's go home. Nirmal, I have news. You'll get a shock. I heard it and ran to save you. - Save me? - Yes, you. - Yes. What's your spin now? - Tell. - No, no spinning. I have news of your diamond. - About Uma. - Uma? What happened to her? Why're you so afraid? Nothing's the matter with her. The matter is with you, mister. Your Uma is double crossing you. Meena, don't speak in riddles. State facts. Okay, listen. Uma gained success today in work, and other things. - She's getting married to Janaki babu. - What? Yes. I heard it with my own ears. Janaki babu said... 'If it were possible, I'd have married you.' 'You don't mind my saying that, Uma?' She answered quickly, 'Not at all.' When they came out they were very happy. She was so proud she snubbed me. Anyway, it's not about me. She doesn't care about you either. Janaki babu has money, so she chose him. If you had, she'd be yours. Is that all, or there's more? You don't believe me? Go and ask her. No need. I believe you. Now go. Aren't you happy you found out the truth so soon? She's not worth the dust of your shoes. - Meena go away. - Nirmal... you know how much I love you. I knew you were mine. And you will belong to me. Oh, Nirmal. Our lives. Why are you pushing me out? Nirmal. I said a lot of things in the theater. - Are you annoyed? - No. Don't mind whatever I say. I'm getting old. Sometimes I say things I shouldn't. Forgive me. - How was the day? Did you get a job? - No. Why didn't you come to the theater? I was looking out for you. I didn't feel like it. Would you like to hear what happened there? I know. You were very successful. - How did you find out? - It was my belief. - I also heard about it. - From whom? Everyone. - Such news spreads like fire. - What's the matter? Have I done something wrong? No. What wrong? Only that sometimes I feel... we are like two trains which met at a small station... - then left for our destinations. - Why are you talking like this? - I'm feeling afraid. - Why? If it really happens, then? So why are you already worried? Today you should be happy in every way. Yes, I should. But... I don't know what to say. I can't say more. Do you understand its meaning? - You really want me to keep it? - Yes. - That's why I put it on you. - Then come. - Bhaiya, bhaiya. - Yes. - What is it? - Bhaiya, we're getting married. - Married? - Yes. - To Uma? - Yes. Why're you quiet, bhaiya? Say something. What's there to say? Yes, get married. - It's good news. - Really? Come. What cruelty! It's your wedding night... bridegroom is alone, and the bride's missing. - What are you doing here? - Nothing. I came to congratulate both of you. But I see... only the bridegroom's here. Perhaps the bride hasn't returned from the theater. - Really? - Yes. You have my sympathy. I don't need your sympathy. Get out of here. Of course. I came to go away. I'm not settling here. But I must say something. If I were the bride... I wouldn't have left my bridegroom alone like this. No matter what came. Meena, stop spouting poison and go away. This is nothing. It's the beginning of love. Wait and watch what lies ahead. - Shut up! - Get angry as much as you want... but you can't deny the truth. You don't know who Uma is. Where she's from. Who her parents are. I did my best, but no one listens. You didn't think it was important. Just dying for her. She doesn't even care for you. If she did, she wouldn't go to the theater to get applause. Can anyone get along with such a woman? This woman will ruin your home... your peace of mind, destroy everything, and sully your name. What are you doing, Uma? Because of what she said. Why did she? Anyway, let it be. Come, sit. - What's the matter Meena Devi? - Nothing. You're rubbing your cheeks. Did you get hurt? - What's it to you? - Nothing, nothing. But you must have enjoyed it, yes? - Go away. - Good. - What happened? - Nothing. Don't know why Meena Devi got angry with her picture. And then broke it. Strange. - We'll be leaving home tomorrow. - Leaving? - Why? - Because Uma's unhappy here. - Unhappy? Why? - There are many reasons. Why're you talking nonsense? Where's Uma? No use speaking to her. And I won't let her work in your theater. Oh, I see. What changed your mind suddenly? I don't have to answer your questions. Uma's my wife, and I don't want her to work. - That's it. - What will you live on? At least tell me that. I expect to get a job soon. So wait till you get it. I too want to rejoice that you finally did something. - Till then I won't let Uma go anywhere. - Why not? You want to argue with me? You've been a wastrel all your life. Wasted so much money! And now you want to ruin a girl's life? - Why should it bother you? - Why? I've spoiled you by giving in to all your wishes. I feel guilty and want to set things right. Okay? - What if she too wants to leave? - No. She's not a fool like you. But if she does, I'll object. Is it a joke? Come and go as you please. - You won't let her go? - Never. Not until you're responsible enough to run your home. Come back when you're capable of this. - Alright. But if anything happens to Uma, you'll be responsible. - Yes. Don't teach me my responsibilities. Stupid. - What happened? - Uma's unconscious. - Unconscious? The Doctor's with her. Don't go in. - But why did this happen? - Don't worry. There's no danger. You'll kill her. You. - Are you in your senses? - No, you are. You're taking her life. - Shut up. - I won't. I know you wanted to marry her. And when you couldn't, you wanted revenge. - From both of us. - Nirmal! Nirmal babu, don't talk nonsense. - Uma will be alright. - Once she's well... it's goodbye to you and your work. - You've done all you wanted. - Okay. Okay. How's she? - How long has she been working? - Six months. Six months?! - She mustn't work now. - Why? Any danger? She's going to have a baby. Baby? Then what're you doing standing here? Go and do something quickly. Don't worry. There's time. - May I go in? - Yes. - But don't bother her with anything. - Alright. - Go quietly. How're you feeling? You know what I'm going to do? I'll take you away from here. And look after you myself. Really? I'll be very happy. - I've become exhausted. - My Uma. I'll not let you work here. I'll arrange for a house and take you away at once. - Nirmal. Take her in this condition? Can't you see? - I do. I also see my responsibilities. - Don't be silly. Use your brains. I'll never forget your kindness... but I can see I can't work anymore. I'm very tired. Yes. But it doesn't mean you have to leave. At least not in your present state. Thank you. But I won't leave her here any longer. No matter what. If you too want to go, then I can't do anything. The house is yours. Come back whenever you feel like. Didi, you'll take me too, no? I'll work here, and live with you. Of course. Yes? Uma come quickly. She won't stop crying. - What's the matter? - Nothing. - She's hungry. - Give it to me. - Only this much milk? - Yes. You were to meet somebody for a job today. Aren't you going? You might get it. Yes, I'm going. But don't be late for dinner. I won't. Didi, how long can this go on? Janaki babu was asking... why Uma doesn't stay here... until Nirmal gets a job? No, Babul. I left. I don't want to go back to be a burden again. And Nirmal won't like it. Why don't you work? - You used to. - It's not possible anymore. It isn't for your sake, but for the baby's. How will you feed her after some days? Let's see. God will help. Answer the door. Oh you. Come in. - Where's Nirmal? - He's gone out. Who is it, Babul? - He's come for the rent. - Namaste, Uma Devi. The owner is adamant. He wants the 10 month's rent. He's very angry. If you don't pay today, he'll ask you to leave. I did my best, but... How much is it? - Rs160. - Rs 160? Come back later, I'll give it. Oh, has Nirmal babu found a job? Not yet, but God willing, very soon. How will you arrange for so much money? I will. Come again after awhile. Alright. Namaste. Babul, come here. Go to a jeweller's... and sell this for any amount. This is the only thing left. - Don't sell it. - What to do Babul? I have to think about the child. We can spend our days out in the open... but the child needs a roof. I know you're feeling bad. But I have no choice. Sell it and get money, my dear brother. Rs 240. Rs 240? Here's the rent. - Did you borrow it? - No. I'd kept some aside for bad times. Now you'll get a lot of milk to drink. A full stomach. A white moustache. No hunger or thirst. No crying. Just drink milk and... sleep. Uma, very good news. They need a man in Lahore. I must go and meet him. - Lahore? - Yes. - You'll have to go? - Of course, or else no job. Why? Nothing. Oh, I forgot. There's nothing to eat, and I'm dreaming of going to Lahore. How much will you need? A lot. Anyway, let it be. How much? At least Rs 50 or 60 or more. Get ready. Money will be arranged. - How? - Not your concern. - Get ready. - No, I don't agree. Why not? I know you'll get the job. My heart says so. My heart is sinking. If I don't get it? I'm sure you will. At least go. Write as soon as you get there. Otherwise I'll get worried. I can't decide what to do. You should start packing at once. Go. You give me courage, Uma. If I get the job... it'll be your victory. Come on. Is my victory any different from yours? You go and get ready. I'll return after feeding the baby. Okay. Now how will you manage? The One who gave us a mouth will also provide food. Why worry? Right, Munni? Dalip has come to see you. That's kind of you. Please come. You're great, sister in law. Smiling in the midst of trouble? Good and bad times are a part of life. Why to cry? Please sit. - What shall I serve? - Bhabi (sister-in-law)... I didn't come to get served. It's my home, too. I have something to say to you. - What, bhaiya? - So many days have passed... and Nirmal hasn't written... where and how he is. What's he doing, while here you... Bhaiya, he must be wandering around looking for a job. He didn't get the one he went for. And lack of money. He needs every paisa he has. But you're having to starve. No money even for Munni's milk. It'll get better. He'll be back soon. And if he isn't? No, no. This isn't good, bhabi. Here, take. Janaki babu sent it. Thank him on my behalf. But I can't accept it, Dalip babu. What's this, bhabi? You always return the money he sends. How long are you going to wait? You're going hungry... and also your child. No, bhaiya. God's given me hands and feet. If nothing else, I'll work. If that's so... why not work at the theater? In fact Janaki babu has sent this message too. - Yes? - No, Dalip babu. I can't, without his knowledge. You won't work in the theater. Won't take help. Then? Jobs aren't easy to get. Just look at her. She's half-dead from want of food. Can't open her eyes. Innocent, helpless. She can't speak, she can't do anything. - You'll kill her. - No, don't say that. What else? I tell you, if she dies... you'll cry all your life. - Babul. - Yes, didi. Dalip bhaiya is right. If something happens to her, then? No, no. I won't let it while I'm alive. Babul, until I return... stay with her. If she cries... put this in her mouth. She'll be quiet. But it's empty. She'll be quiet. I'll bring milk on my way back. And... don't leave her alone, okay? No, didi. Let's go. Oh fair one, meet me across the Ganga I'll put a gold ring on your finger Meet me across the Ganga, my beloved I'll come wearing a green chunari (long piece of cloth) My empty hut is situated by the side of Ganga I look out for you all afternoon Come my rani with your water pot I stand by Ganga with my empty water pot Restless like a fish out of water Please swear to come, my raja Across the Ganga Our eyes... will meet No one should see us, and throw a pebble Oh fair one, oh my beloved, meet me across the Ganga Babul. I've found a job. - Where? - Later. Where's Uma? Oh, my child. My Munni. My daughter. Lying here all alone. Where's Uma? Where's Uma? Why aren't you telling me? What is it? - Nothing. - Then tell me where Uma is? - She's gone to the theater. - Theater? - When? - This evening. But I told her not to. There was no money and Janaki babu wanted to help. So he called didi. Now I see the money's source. She didn't tell me. Forced me to go away, and went to dance in the theater leaving the child alone. It's not like that. I'll explain everything. Meena, I have to do something. Please go out for a while. Why for a while? - We're going forever. - What? Yes. After what happened today, we can't stay here. I didn't understand. Why would you? Changed the act, and made me a chorus girl. Replaced me with her. You don't see this humiliation? I didn't mean to insult you. I wanted to give Uma a chance. She was in need. See? The change was only for today. There was no other way. For her you always find a way. Even if it hurts another. Even when she's in disgrace. We're only here to obey. After all we're servants. What do you say? What's there to say? Meena may be your employee, but she's my daughter. Her humiliation is mine. Alright. Leave. That's not right, Janaki babu. Not because of me. When anyone leaves, I can't stop them. Forgive me sister. I don't want to deprive you. Why are you going? You wouldn't understand. You haven't lost anything in life. My heart knows... you got whatever you wanted. Snatched everything from me. My name. My respect. - And even my... - That's enough. Go if you want, but don't say anymore. Alright. - We'll go. - Go. Take this. You gave it to me after my first success. I'm returning this. - Meena, where's Uma. - In the office with Janaki babu. Nirmal, you might be happy to know... that I'm leaving here. I always teased you... but I've been punished. Anyway. Before I go let's shake hands. - You're leaving? - Yes, forever. I'm not needed here. Uma's back. She got what she wanted. Why not? Janki babu is generous to her. And... anyway... Let it be as it is. We don't need to point fingers. Come. Won't you shake hands? I feel bad that... they left because of me. Not because of you. They'd become arrogant. When I do anything for you... it's nobody's business to interfere and insult you. Yes, but... Don't talk of them. They always did as they wished. I said nothing. After you left... I wanted to close down the theater. Then I thought you might need it one day. So I let it run. I didn't know... you'd do so much for me. How can I thank you? No need, Uma. I'm happy you came back. The theater was waiting. - It's yours, no? - Yes. You can't go anywhere now. Nor will I let you suffer. Whether you work or not, you'll stay here. When Nirmal returns, I'll set him straight. Okay, I'll go now. Baby is hungry. - She must be crying. - Yes, go. Don't be long. The next play's about to start. And you come in at the beginning. Here, take. - So much! - Yes. Half from the owner of the theater... half from your elder brother. To his younger sister. Okay now go. Listen! Bring the baby with you. I'll look after her. Dalip, take her home in my car. And you both must return quickly. Where are you? Where's Munni? Babul! - What happened bhabi? - There's no one at home. Neither Babul nor Munni. Where have they gone? He's here. They must've all gone to the theater to get you. Come. - Are they here? - Who? Babul, my child, and your younger brother. He's returned. No one's at home. - They didn't come here. - They didn't? What is it? Nirmal bhaiya took the child away. Gone? Where? I don't know. I tried to stop him, but he wouldn't. I ran behind his taxi. But got tired. Didi, he won't come back. Why did he leave? Don't know. He'd just arrived. He's found a job. When I told him you were at the theater... he left in anger. He came back with a taxi, and left with baby. He left this letter. Uma, you've found your way, I've found mine. Our daughter mustn't get tainted with her mother's disgrace. So I'm taking her with me. Don't search for me. You're dead for us. Nirmal A ticket for Kalkotta. Drink. Babuji, why's didi so silent? Why won't she talk? Don't worry. She'll be alright. Janki babu, Nirmal and Munni must be found soon. Yes, I'll inform the police. - He couldn't have gone far. - Janaki babu. If you like, I'll go to the station. He must have gone there. Yes, go. Didi, what's happening? It's all my fault. I forced you to come here. Please speak. Say something. Punish me. Beat me. I'm ready. My act is first. What expectations one had from him But what is he doing? He built it up himself... and is pulling it down himself He came as love But now has become tears He made one laugh He's now making one weep This feeling of despondency This helpless world Even though my heart is on fire, I still smile Whose voice is this? Who's calling me? Someone tell me Is it him, calling me? Is he calling me? No news of Nirmal. The police are searching. Don't worry. I'll search every corner of the world. Have courage. Yes Uma, it's possible... it'll take a long time. Months. But he'll be found, definitely. Your Munni will once again play in your lap. I promise. What kind of horse is this? It doesn't walk. It's lame. It can't walk. It must walk. - Come on. - Okay. One... two, and three. Careful, we're coming. It has come apart. I don't care. Get up. What happened babuji? Why're you lying so. The horse has fallen apart. Right, horse? No, Manju. Don't trouble babuji. - His hands and feet will start hurting. - Really, babuji? - Becoming a horse hurts you? - No beti (daughter) I've been a horse all my life. Last birth, and the one before that. Put it here. Come let's have breakfast. Where's the paper? Babuji, after you go to the office... - what shall I do? - No office today. - It's Sunday. - Oh, we can play all day long. - Yes? - What! - Have you forgotten? - What? You're on the radio today. Then we go to Bipin babu's. Oh, yes! - What happened babuji? - Nothing. You look strange. - A picture. - Whose? - A woman's. - What woman? You don't know her. She's come from far. - She works in the theater. - Show me. Eight years have gone by. It's a long period of time. Perhaps another eight years will go by. But don't lose courage, Uma. I believe... your prayers will be answered. What to do, Uma? The world always punishes the innocent. But God must be seeing this. - Janaki babu, the police inspector is here. - Coming. Don't be disheartened. The police are trying. He'll be found. Why won't he be found? Why don't you say something? - Why don't you talk to me? - Yes, beti. I will. Babuji. If you go to the theater... I'll come too. Forget the radio. The radio program is scheduled. We'll go there. - We'll go to the theater some other time, okay? - Okay. - Enough. - What is it? - What's the matter with you? - I don't know. My heart is sinking. Seems like something's about to happen. No, what can happen? You were listening to the sitar by pundit Babulal. Our next program will start shortly. Nunni, switch the radio off. Children's program. A song by Manju rani. - What will you sing? - 'You're welcome to'. Okay, sing. You're welcome to... these lofty palaces We love our own lanes In spite of living in palaces you get no peace Those who sleep in these lanes on sheets of sorrow... are the ones who rejoice and revel in their dreams You're bewitched by your wealth of gold and silver Our heart is our wealth You might think our tears are water from the eyes For us they are strings of pearls We love our lanes Babul, remember this song? Yes didi. The one you sang in front of the house. - Yes it's the same. - But no one else knows this song... - except him. - Who's the girl singing? - Find out quickly. - Yes. Operator. Please give me the radio station. Yes. Please be quick. Plot number 235. Park Road. Thank you. Babul get a taxi, quickly. - Give this. - You're going there? - Yes. He's here. My daughter too. I can't wait here anymore. - Okay lets go. - No, first I'll go alone. It's an unknown place. Don't go alone. - Dalip, go with her. - Alright. Bhabi, this is it. Found it finally. - I'll go first. - Why? Let's go together. No, you wait here. I'll send for you. Here. Let me look. You're blooming like a flower, beti. - Give me my present for this. - Here. Babuji, a lady's come to see you. Okay. What? - A lady? - Yes. - Who is it? She didn't say. But wants to meet with you. - Who is it, father? - Somebody. I'll go and see. You put on your shoes. Yes. What would you like? You? How did you come here? I'll tell you all. There's a lot to tell. - Where is she? - Who? Munni. Our Munni. - Okay. Please sit. - I will sit... but first bring her to me. - My heart is restless. - Babuji, I'm ready. I'm coming beti. You stay there. Why did you bolt the door? Call her please. You won't bring my child to me? Uma, listen. I'll tell you frankly. Frankly? It's been ages. Have you not forgiven me? Punishing me still... - for no fault? - It's not that. It's something else. Reason? You left me without reason. I've been living on one hope only. For the day... when you'd listen and once again love me. Munni's your daughter, mine too. I can't live without her. I'm her mother. Uma, I have no choice. Why? I've told her you're dead. Tell her I'm not dead. - I'm alive. - How to tell her... that her mother's a dancer. It will spread, and her life will be ruined. No, I can't do this. Then let's go and live in another place. Where no one will find out. We'll start a new life. I won't work in the theater. - I don't like it myself. - No. Uma. Your name will follow us everywhere. I've worked hard for this business and respect. Because of Munni. I can't leave all this. - Munni needs all this. - Babuji. Please come. I'm ready. We have a guest. I'm speaking with her. I'll come in a minute. Bring her to me. I beg you. Please bring her. No, Uma. Don't ruin her life. Don't disgrace her. Finally I have a house, name, respect. Don't snatch it away. Let her live happily. Okay. Let me see her, just once. I'll go away after that. Babuji. Why did you bolt it? Let me come. Yes, I'll open it. Just wait, Uma. Promise... you won't tell her that... you're her mother. And never come back. Speak. Manju, she wants to meet you. - She's known us for a long time. - Namaste. Namaste. Come here. You're so pretty, beti. Even your name is pretty. Manju. - Who gave you this name? - My mother. Mother? - Do you remember her? - No. I was very small when she died. Babuji says... - What does he say? - That my mother was very beautiful. Wait. This is my mother. This is me. Do you like her? Yes. Babuji says my mother was very nice. And I should be like her. I will be. - Right? - Yes, beti. Sure. But she was very unlucky, Manju. Why? How do you know? I knew her. She was my friend. She loved me a lot. Really? You've seen her? Tell me about her. If I tell you, will you love me? Yes, a lot. We should leave now, or else we'll be late. We have to go somewhere. You have to go? Alright. Then go, beti. I'll come again. - I'll tell you all about your mother. - When will that be? - You tell me. - Tomorrow. Alright. - Manju. - Yes? - You said... you love me a lot. If I ask you for something, will you give it? Yes. What? Your doll. When I look at it... I will think of you. Yes, take it. I don't play with dolls. Be happy, my child. May God protect you. Babuji, she's nice. She loves me a lot. When she comes tomorrow, I'll play with her the whole day. - Yes? - Yes, beti. Come. Wear your coat. How was it? Did you see them? Yes. I met them. Saw Munni. She's grown up now. Talks very sweetly. She gave me this doll. For keeps. What is it bhabi? Nothing bhaiya. Munni will stay with him. She has a name, a good house... and needs respect, right? I can't snatch this all away. You wait here. I'll be back right away. - Are you hurt? - Don't know. Uma, are you alright? Yes, I'm alright. It wasn't my fault. She came in the way. - I was... - It's okay. Bhabi, can you stand? - If you want I can take her. - Yes, that would be fine. Come bhabi. - Where are you? - Manju? - Manju, do you like the lady who came? - Very much. - What if she lives with us? - Really? Then I'll play in her lap all day. And if I tell you she's your mother? My mother? But you said she's dead. Yes, I said. But if I tell you she's alive? Wouldn't she have come to me? Listen, beti, I told you a lie. - What? - Yes, she's not dead. - Not dead? No, she's alive. The lady who came... she's your mother. Babuji, I want to go to her. - I want to... - Yes, beti, yes. What happened? Come, I'll tell you. Manju, forgive me. I'll never be able to meet you again. May God always keep you happy. Driver, hurry up. Manju, I'm here, beti. My child. What happened? - Didi. - I've found my child. Thank God. Let me see, beti. How pretty. Where are you going? What I should've done earlier... I've done today. Now I'm not needed so I'm going. Listen. Come into this room. I must say something. You don't want to live with Uma? - May I ask why? - She might not need me anymore. Perhaps you don't know... I'm longing to fulfill a lifelong wish. I've not been able to fulfill it yet. What? This. Come on. You can reciprocate. No, bhaiya. I deserve it. Yes, you did. Stupid. Come on. - Ask her forgiveness. - No, there's no need. Why not? Hold your ears. There goes the bell. Get to work everyone. Make way. Sisters, and brothers... I'm going to introduce a new artist today. I mean, my daughter, Manju. Come tomorrow, and I'll sing more. Very good! Very good! Dear friend, the spring has arrived, and longing has ended The woods are blooming
