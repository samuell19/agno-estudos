Berger, Mr. Walter's personal assistant. - I have a telegram. - Urgent? From his wife, performing in Salzburg. Miss Koukowska? They are divorced. They are not divorced. They are separated. That's the same thing. He must be angry because she is famous too. Two stars under the same roof! If you're sure it's urgent, go over and disturb him. - No, I'm not sure if it's urgent. - Read on then. I read it. She wrote, "I need to see you, Marie." Let me see. Is it good or bad? - No more words. - Indeed. - Wait until he gets out of class. - Be cautious. Take your breath away and don't forget you're on stage. Your voice reaches the top floor from all directions. The wonderful sound can fill the whole hall. Three thousand spectators were waiting. continue. Okay, thank you. Your midrange is better. and stretches your treble. Nice, but didn't quite get through it. Take your time and breathe. I can't breathe at all. inhale. Your breathing is not normal. I told you before! Don't breathe from above, from below, - Right where your belt is. - Yes, master. You have to practice every morning strengthen these muscles and stretch your ribcage. Yes, Master. Sit down. Good.

You can resume singing tomorrow. Very good. Courage is commendable. Thanks, but I don't need help getting dressed. - Goodbye Master. - Goodbye. - Goodbye Master. - Goodbye. I never noticed Sophie Dimater. Her baby face is very sensual. You are so lucky. He didn't listen to me at all. Next time he will listen. Wrap yourself up and you'll catch a cold. The next class is two days away. I can't wait! How can you love him more than I do! I am more and he makes me happy! You are not lightly ill, but it is ridiculous. - Are there classes tonight? - Yes, a guy from the Munich Opera. - What is it, Berger? - An urgent telegram, sir. Is there a riot there? No, we publish student lists, Chosen for the school's annual concert. - Is it bad news? - Don't know. - With him, long live Rudi! - Are you on the list? I forgot to read it! Are you sad that you didn't choose? Kind of, but I'm happy for you. as I wish. She got points in Eric's bed. - Eric is hurt? - Explain to her. I can't stand her! Do you know how babies are made, Erica? Of course, you have to get married first. How arrogant you are! Do me a favor. Go to the nearest bookstore Looking for the original version of the Kinsey (Sexology) report - Erica! - OK, here I come. Can you model for my father at night? Of course, thanks, Elis. I will be there on time after lunch. - Then to me? - Okay. Goodbye. We want three hams and two steaks.. - I want a drink. And some bread! - My treat. - Now you have money? Elis asked me to model his father, a sculptor Is it nude? He likes when I wear tights That way he would capture my natural shadow. Three hams and two steaks. Two steaks. Hey, that's my steak. Your smoke will ruin my vocal cords. Their house is weird. Nothing happened, it was normal. Her father never spoke. All he does is try to find natural shades. Her mother had been stuck in bed for two years. - What happened to her mother? - She's dying. Elis gave her morphine to ease the pain. He works all day. Want me to call him? good. - Lunch is ready, ma'am. - Thank you. - Do you have lunch? - Yes. So, there you are. Little one? how is she? Not very good. I called her. - She wants to see you. - Really? I can't, try to explain it to her. - She already knows. - She knows, doesn't she? If I see her, I can't work. - Mr. Walter! - Eric! I didn't expect to see you. You gave me a telegram, Marie. You are right! I forgot! So don't talk about telegrams now. I had a car accident yesterday after rehearsal. I can't sing a note. In panic I sent you a telegram. I'm so stupid. Tonight's performance was the best ever. - I understand. - Did you hear me sing? No, I just got here. I drove here like a lunatic. You have always been a car racer. Eric, do you remember what happened three years ago? You hurt me, you beast! Sorry sweetie, but you scratched me. You don't speak during the intermission. Don't stand there. You are too tall when you stand. I've always thought so. sit next to me! You love to be gloomy. Too much to spend! I have been surrounded by flowers for many years, I still only like white roses. Speak, Eric. Let me know when those lines appear. I never noticed them before. It makes you look indifferent. I like them. - Let me know when they show up. - I have nothing to tell you. I came empty-handed. Since you left, all I have are my wrinkles. All in! It's ready! - Roses for you. - Too many flowers! Throw them out or find a place for them. I'm taking a break. I talk too much. Can I call you tomorrow morning, sweetheart? - Am I waiting for you. - No. I've made plans to spend time with scary and boring people. If our situation is not so complicated, you can come with me. How about breakfast tomorrow? I won't be here tomorrow morning. Then we'll see you after we're done. I love you 6，7，8，9. 1，2, 3，4, 5，6，7, 8. A young girl can't act like a slut. - You come back at two in the morning! - Really? I haven't slept because of you. Are you with the violinist? - Fiddler! - Bad girl! No, I love him. Girls your age shouldn't be in a relationship. If the girl's lover supports him, that's excusable. Besides, she is a prostitute. - What about your Mr. Dumoulin? - Want a slap? No, but Rudi is not my lover. I don't care what you think, - But I want to marry him! - Marry? Yes, get married, have kids, stay home! - You're crazy! - You're all married! My end is chores and cooking. - And two silly girls! - And Mr. Dumoulin. I don't care what you think. I love him! The reality is, I have a stupid daughter. At least Sophie knows what she wants. - She's going to be a star. - Do you think so, Sophie? Yes, I'm sure I will. 1, 2... - Yann! - Come and have lunch with us, Yann? OK. Look, that's Eric's sedan. His latest conquest. Do you know her? No. I thought he canceled the class because he was ill. He cured himself with champagne! - What's going on? - Eric Walter and a nurse. I want to lose myself in your curves, Like Tannhauser (German poet). What's your name? I hope you're kidding, Eric. You make me forget everything! You are crazy, but I love crazy men! - Stop in public! Watch your behavior. - I don't care! Tonight is my last show. What a fantastic idea, my love! Opera, that old thing is so outdated. - Take it back or I'll leave! - Take back what? - Old stuff! - I don't! How is he this morning? He's been furious for days now. He didn't do anything except throw things at people. I'm sure he might still catch a cold! This door is usually closed. This is his wife's room. We have been locked. Nothing was touched, as if she had just been out. He sat there through the middle of the night, With his eyes open, he was dumbfounded. It's like I'm dead. - See if he's awake. - Sir, I'm afraid he might... Enough, I want to sleep! I'm sleeping! I said no! You were nothing until you met me! Give me some face and let me sleep! Listen, Eric. You cancel your class and say you are sick while singing the opera. The director has had a stroke! And do a better job of replacing your tenor. you are lying! your students chanting your name, But they were drowned in applause. - What about the reviews? - Excellent. Why are you reading it? You say critics are idiots. They know as much about opera as I do about growing beetroot. Listen to this, Clement. "Despite his best efforts, But it was overshadowed by the perfect skill of Eric Walter. - Unique, unparalleled sound." - Now you care about reviews! No, I'll keep it. Lohengrin tonight? Yes, but you can't sing after staying up all night. I can. Berger, get my bathrobe. thanks. Lock her house and give me the key. Take care of your voice. I worry about you a lot. Me too, but that's all going to change. I make mistakes, but women always come home with me. - Maybe, but one has left you. - Who? Miss Lukas left the school. That's good news. She has thick thighs And she's so piercing in the high notes! She has started to perform opera. Now living with Bleliche. Her departure affected student concerts, however. She gave us trouble even after she left! - No one can replace her. - You are wrong. Who? Elis Petersen. Why Elis Petersen? Because she's going to fight an angel. with an angel? Yes. remember... Jacob fought until dawn with an angel sent by God. The next day, he had to face the angel. Your student must fight her angel, the public. All Elis needs to do is discover her abilities, Knowing her voice is both a gift and a profession. Elis is brilliant, the best in your class, - But you never noticed her. - Maybe I was blind then! you are a bad teacher, Your students are always sitting behind you. When I observed them, they didn't even notice. I know them well. Some of them don't blink for a moment for you. They don't want to miss a note and beat. Others read detective novels in your class. The romantic one is imagining your princely charm. Some always burst out laughing while others laughed every time. Some are confident and happy who hold their destiny. Then there's Elis Petersen. She is a soul thinker with a beautiful voice, But she closed herself. She was waiting for a sign that would bring her back to life. If you choose her... We replaced Miss Lukas with Miss Petersen. Me? At a concert? I can't do that. No, you can. We will choose your song. You need a romance, your voice is not good enough for opera. - Got an idea? - Yes, Schubert. Which song did you identify? You know, Clement? Yes. No, that's too sad. I like the other one, but I can't remember the name. - That's good. - The ending is beautiful. very good, But why did you choose such a sad song? When you love someone, you are afraid of losing him. I forbid you to choose sad songs. Sing "La rose des Bruyeres". It's a cheerful, childlike song. - You know it? - Yes, I sing it when I'm happy. beginning. Your little one is making waves. Don't worry about me. I've got Donna Anna. Well, well. Mr. Killian is late again! It's great that you came up. I love being interrupted in the intermediate class. You know! Get the house ready for Mr. Killian. The heating is better here. Don't be in a hurry and take your time. Are you comfortable? Can I continue? Thank you. We'll pick a song for you tomorrow at my house. - Thank you, Master. - Miss Dimater, it's your turn. - What have you prepared? - Donna Anna, "Don Giovanni". Weird choice. - Why, Master? - No reason. to the front. She can't sing Donna Anna in front of Eric! - Why? - It was his wife's famous song. It won't end well! Not expressing enough. Pay attention to your wording. No attenuation is required on "fa" or "sol". No, Miss Dimater, have mercy! Donna Anna is a woman in love, A beautiful woman who has loved and suffered. You sound like a country girl at a wedding. continue. What are you thinking? Your voice is not strong enough to sing this! You are David disguised as Goliath. You are not Goliath, you don't even have a door! If you don't know it you don't sing opera. you gotta have pain and life experience! You have to be a woman, not a little girl. She is a hot girl! Very temperamental, she's going to be a star. Go and help Miss Dimater. Calm her down. Well, well, Erica. Forgive me for taking you out of detective fiction. "Women's Sexual Behavior" Kinsey Report! If you want to learn something, go to the front. Miss Bonnard, what will you sing for us? - Are you crying? - No, I will never cry! - You're too involved, Sophie? - Koukowska sings badly! Because of her, he drinks every night Then he took his anger on his students. If a woman dumps a man, he shouldn't be chasing her. - Maybe he still loves her? - He doesn't know what love is! - Did you know? - He's a rock. Everyone is looking at him, and he is not looking at anyone! Love is stronger than any language. I think that is love. Gestures and words cannot express. no, Elis, Love is sleepless nights. It's your struggle when your naked body is pinned down. Goodbye, master. I have to get back to tennis. I used to be the best in the college. You mentioned it during your visit. Feeling better, Miss Dimater? Come to my house tomorrow with your friends - Continue our lessons. - Thank you, Master. - Is he angry? - Did he take you home? No, I will work with him tomorrow. - No way! - You are so lucky! People came from Paris to work with him! I know! I'd better go back to art school. Thank you for lending me this coat. - I hope it fits. - He'll see that I'm not a kid. I'm going to let the last five lessons prove this! Did he mention me during your class? No, he talks about himself. Is my neck bare? Can I borrow your necklace? No, it was given to me by my mother. All right, I'm leaving. - I'll go to your house after class. - Okay! Go on! Go hard, don't be afraid! Come, Master! I'll come! excuse me. Hey? Miss Dimater came to class. Tell her to start rehearsing her arpeggios. Tell her to start rehearsing her arpeggios. I have to go! I forgot her class. Berger, I'm going to sing Tannhauser tonight better than ever. Little fish! They don't understand French. They are Chinese fish. You must think I'm being rude. Not at all, why would I think that? I got the privilege. I've always wanted to see this house. - Did you like it? - Yes! I like palm trees, flowers and fish. So is the pond. I want to swim in it. Go! The water is warm. I've always wanted a mermaid. I have to be careful not to scare my little mermaid. I saw her swimming, wild and naked. out of the water, Miss Dimater, We are about to start work. Clement isn't here, so I'll come with you. I practiced the Desdemona song. Will Miss Petersen come with us? - No, she has class tomorrow. - She is making progress. She was very happy about it. I shouldn't have called you a little girl. Come forward. If you don't play, I can't sing. Don't move. You are beautiful. Your butt is so smooth. Your hands are shaking. - You are almost disturbing. - Almost? - You are a work being polished. - Mean? It means you will be beautiful in the future. When you become a real woman you will know what love is. - What's wrong? - I don't want to sing. You always surprise me. Sit next to me. kiss me again. Good girl's words. Let's go now. You can't stay here. Ok. She even took her sheet music. Want a hot drink? I'll be on stage in two hours, Berger. Such a powerful character! - This is to teach you! - I don't care. Brave. That's sexy! - I was waiting for you last night. - I was tired, so I went to bed. - How is your course? - General. He talks about my vibes and treble. Come to dinner tomorrow and then we will practice again. Okay, thank you. the last time. All the dancers returned to the stage. hurry up! You have never been so lively and seductive in my class. I'm going to be jealous! You will catch a cold. - Are you going to dance? - No, I skipped it. So why not wrap yourself up? - Are you going home now? - Yes. - Can I drive you home? - Yes. finish dressing. I'm waiting in the car. Please turn on the music. Clement, don't forget tomorrow's class. I am very happy to be with Elis. She has been working very hard lately. She will be a great singer. You are a strange girl. You were full of joy the day before, On the verge of crying the next day. It's not hard to imagine at all. Everything depends on Eric. I am happy when he is nice to me I cry when he is estranged. He was great those days. - Promise me, Elis. - What? nothing. You are all stupid and blind! Sophie! come here! - Don't turn on the lights. - Come here! Why are you coming home so late? Look at you, shudder, collapse. Get closer. I guess it will happen one day. This is inevitable. Should you get at least one role? Mother! how dare you? Let's talk tomorrow. - Give me a good night kiss. - No. Then go straight to sleep. Sophie! what? come here. - Are you with him? - Yes. - In his place? - What do you mean? OK, I understand. You don't feel like crying? Quite the opposite. I'm afraid you will be sad. How does it feel? In the novel, they call it happiness, but this one is better. I am sick. I sing Eleazar tonight. It's your fault! Walking in the snow is your idea. - What a stupid idea! - I thought it would make you happy. You are stupid for such an adventure. Hope I don't have a cold. I think it will be fine. Master, are your feet cold? If not, you can try to... They are frozen! Put me in a hot bath! No, warm up some wine first! Get me herbal tea, aspirin, hot water bottle. and all heaters. And an inhaler! No, not my bathrobe! I'm keeping my fur coat. Bring me blankets and quilts. I'm going to try to warm up. I can still play treble. I'm having trouble in that register, Berger. One always pays a high price for stupidity. after you shower, You have to rest and drink herbal tea. This is what we professionals should be like. - It's slavery, isn't it, Berger? - Yes, sir, slavery. Elis! Elis! Yes, Mom. Goodbye, sweetheart. We're going to be late for rehearsal. I don't know if I should go or not. My mother is very ill. you must go! The director will be there. I don't want to leave my mother alone. Are you sure you don't have stage fright? I have no idea. I am afraid of this rehearsal. Then I'll stay with my mother. do not. Well, I'm not at the concert, Just thinking of directors and reporters - Makes me stage fright. - Don't worry, it will all pass. do you think so? I'm afraid I can't sing at all. every night, I dreamed that I opened my mouth, but no sound came out. You are thinking too much. Let's go! - I'm scared, Clement. - Don't worry, you're doing fine. Do you think she will be ok? Look at me, Elis! Don't worry. Everyone does. Go ahead, Clement. No, I can't do it! I can not do it! What happened, Elis? Dodge. Let someone else come on stage. - Go on stage, Sophie. - Don't stop me! - This is not the time for drama! - I don't feel good. You can play sonatas. - Everything is fine. I'm with you. - I'm sorry! I can't sing. You're not the first singer to get nervous. I've seen Silvani cry like this, Before going on stage at La Scala in Milan. Three thousand people are waiting. You say this to make me feel better. No, it's true. Are you feeling better? Don't let tears ruin your beautiful eyes. Wash your face and go back. Go up and you'll get it! You have to go home, Elis. Your mother is seriously ill. We called the doctor. God! Clement, where is Elis? - She never came back. - This surprised me. - Why? - Come, go have a drink. - We won't stay long. - I don't believe you. I don't want to be alone tonight. I might do something stupid then you have to educate me Promise me to be home by 2 am. I promise. Dad, please don't cry. Go away. Leave me alone. Elis? Why are you hanging out on the street at six o'clock? You are like a ghost in white. come up. - She's cute. - She is! so cute! - Her mother just died. - God! I don't know much about orphans. What am I going to do, Berger? You can start comforting her. - Then it's more natural. - Give her some wine. a good idea. Then clean her shoes. They are dirty! Go get some wine. I went back to Denmark when I was a little boy. I am a crazy little guy. I have left home many times. Tell me more. You make me feel safe. I keep running away. I always hide in the forest and try to raise small animals, But they are all dead. I once found a young injured squirrel. It ran away after I nursed it to recover. Everything I loved has left me. I've always been alone, Elis. Me too. Don't leave me. You are so gentle. Being with you is so relaxing. When my mother was seriously ill, I used to touch her hand. I used to do the same thing when my wife was shaking before she came on stage. I haven't had a moment of peace since she left. But this morning, I found something I thought was gone. - Does it have a name? - It has, peace. happiness. Does it have another name? I love you. I don't want to go to sleep. not now. I'm so scared. - Can I go to the wedding? - Of course. Congratulations! - Hello. He wants me to marry him. You are invited to the wedding. She married him for money. Really? She's kidding! -Are you coming to class? - No, I have something to do. -you've changed. - Is it worth noting? - What? - It's okay. goodbye. - I say thank you - why? for those flowers. You took care of me after my mother died. No. I like to send you flowers. why are you laughing? Eric said you put your head on your sleeve. He is a fool. Don't believe what he says. Elis, please promise me you will never trust him. What happened? - Elis, what are you thinking? - Him. Hello, Berger. Walter has you come downstairs? - No, ma'am - I'll wait for him. - Miss- you look flustered, Berger. For good reason, miss. His wife sent a postcard. This is how it all started. - What is it? - The darkest hour of the master. - No! - He locked himself in her room. lose your temper whenever anyone comes near. - Because of a postcard? - It's not just a postcard. She wrote, "Greetings from Salzburg." - She is so nice! - Not at all! As an autograph photo that is impersonal! He ripped, and he's been bad since then. - I still have to practice. - not today, miss! The master will not tolerate any noise. Stop now, I will not take any responsibility! - Well, I will! - where are you going , miss ? -Drag him out of the temple! - except that! No, miss! You are reading your own love letter. People usually read what they receive. - What are you doing here? - I'm coming to class. No one has the right to enter this room! Especially you. Go away! go away! You are handsome when you are angry. - I love you. - Shut up! Don't say it here. No, that's easy for you! We kiss downstairs and have sex in your room. Then you lock yourself up with your memories here! Either share your life with me or not! - I wouldn't share with a ghost! - Marie is not a ghost! - I love her. - Yesterday, you loved me. Yes, I told you, I could tell ten others the same thing, But I'm talking about Marie! When I saw you, I saw her. Go away! I want to be alone with her for a while. one person! Masters and Ghosts. Made for a good opera. - Go away or I'll be mad! - Oh no, don't do that! - Berger! - Yes, sir. Champagne, Berger! I need a glass. - All wrong. - Yes, I know. The devil took everything. Why do I always come home empty-handed? Why did she send me postcards? Greetings from Salzburg. I am despicable. I sent Sophie away. She must hate me too. It's all over. I'm done with opera. Two days ago, I screwed up a high C. In "Twilight of the Gods"! Greetings from Salzburg. She has no right to do that. She has no right! Is she crying? Who? - Sophie. Did she cry? - No. What? Didn't she cry? no. The poor girl must still be in shock. - She left without a coat on. - She didn't leave. - What do you mean? - Worse, sir. - Worse? - She lost her mind. She is in the pond with Chinese fish. No clothes on! - Let me go! - Temptress! Let me go! You insulted me! other women will cry, But you are strong and arrogant. Today, I found out what kind of woman you are. - You can no longer lock that door. - I will do as you wish. - I want the key. - I give you everything you want. - Do you want me to apologize? - No. I just don't want to share you and the ghost with other people You are the only one! - Have you seen another doctor? - Yes, my friends. - I see. - They all said the same thing: I just need a break. I am a strong woman, doctor. Tell me if I need surgery. Surgery won't fix anything. Your voice won't come back. Your voice is dead. died. I hope it's vocal cord edema, But there are other symptoms: sweating, fatigue, high temperature, etc. All point to tuberculosis. I believe you have tuberculous laryngitis. Strict treatment followed by 6 months of bed rest will cure your cold, But your lungs will keep getting weaker. You can never sing again. That's Miss Dimater. She's making progress, Berger! Listen to that high F! Crystal clear, just like I taught her. - What do you think? - She's amazing! Give me two eggs! Is Mr. Walter at home? lady! Is it really you, ma'am? gentlemen! Come on! Your wife is here. What are you talking about, Berger? Marie, my love! Nice to meet you. I can't believe my eyes. Why don't you call and I will pick you up. I'm scared and not sure if you want to see me. You're scared? I wake up every day waiting for you. - Are you ill, Marie? - I'll tell you all about it. i'm so heartbroken I didn't notice, you are so pale. is it serious? How long will you be staying? I have no idea. Always, if you want. Is there anything else that can be done? An operation...? I am left with you. You must help me. Nothing has changed. Still a teacher-student love. - Sophie isn't the only one? - She is! - Then you get old. - Then another. She writes love letters to me every day. She thinks I love her. I don't want to shatter her dreams. what are you doing here? I don't know. I don't want to be alone. What happened? Tell me! It's all over! what's over? - Everything! - You are stupid. - I wish I was. - I've never seen you cry. are you sick? Did you quarrel with your mother? You are scaring me, Sophie. What an asshole! I'm going to kill him! I can't take it anymore! I gave him everything, But all he did was deceive me, With his body, his hands, his lips. Who? Eric! Who else? I thought it was a love story, But he's just using me until she comes back! I'm just a whore! You must think I am ordinary. You are right. This whole story is ordinary. I hate myself! how could I know? He is a good actor. Now he plays my love scene with her. The words he whispered to me in her ears! I never thought I could be so unhappy. Of course, you can't imagine what it's like. Elis? Dear ERIC, every day I write you a love letter, But then I burned it... You too. what happened? What's the matter, Elis? He kisses me, but he doesn't love me. Open your eyes, Elis. He kisses me, but he doesn't love me. You're in class again, Elis? - No. - Then why are you here? This is a pilgrimage. A year ago, I came to Eric Walter's class for an exam. I am celebrating an anniversary. like you are at a funeral. The pair of candles you lighted. I'm going to put 18 candles on the coffin. Do not be silly! i'm being stupid And I laughed and sang. No, don't say that. i'm coming tonight We will rehearse Schubert for the concert. That makes no sense. I tried, but I can't sing. Something about me died. I am like a hollowed out children's toy. I can fix many things. This toy cannot be repaired. What's the matter with you? You gotta cheer up You work all night and cry all night. Don't pretend you don't know. That's not life! I sing "Death of Isolde" at a student concert. Wagner, at your age! - I can do it. - You are fooling yourself. - All for Eric! - No, for myself. You don't know that way at all. Go to Elis for rehearsal. She has a piano. I can do it with a tuning fork. Why not rehearse a few more times with Elis? It's none of your business. Leave me alone! marvelous! Start arguing! It's 7 am! Heat some water. Grind some coffee. There is no need to cry. First love will not have any result, Especially not this guy. He dumped you and didn't even give you roses. Shut up! A polite man will pay for affection. I'm not afraid to tell him that. If you do that I'll jump out of the window. go away! I need to practice Isolde! Isolde! Is that the best you can do? - You are as stupid as your sister. - What do you mean? Do not bother me! Today is that day. I need a piece of paper with my address on it. Without these, they could have taken me to any hospital. It shouldn't be scary because... In the dictionary it says... Lord, save me. Help me, Mother, give me strength. keep cool. do not panic. - What's your business? - Mr. Clement is here, miss. - I didn't expect him to come. - He's in the study. - He wants to talk to you. - I'll be there soon. You play the piano like a smoker, you just look good. I've prepared a speech, but don't know where to start. Let's start with the hair. All right, get dressed. I'll take you to the theater. No, Clement. - I want you to sing tonight. - I will never sing again. I'm sure you didn't mean that. I have plans for tonight. Listen to me, Elis. I want you to sing on stage. just one time. This will be your salvation. Even for me. To prepare, we can do it. No, Clement. Why do you insist? I'll drag you there if necessary! No! Leave me alone! It's none of your business! you're right. It's none of my business. It is your loss. Clement! Don't be mad at me. Not tonight. I am not angry. I just don't understand why you don't leave them Because of a broken brain. I thought you knew me. Love shouldn't make you sad. Really loving someone will make you happy, Even if there is no return. He's a liar, Clement. He kissed me but he doesn't love me. do not Cry. Trust me, this will pass. Don't be confused. You don't want to be a fool, do you, Elis? I don't want to think anymore. I just want silence. Ahead is your whole life! You gave up without even trying! I am tired of life. Calm down! Don't exaggerate. No other solution? Yes. You think about death too much, Elis. Death is my friend. Yes, but everyone is afraid to die when their time comes. I'm not. Just before I do this, I will be more confident. I look like I'm at a dance. I'm wearing the most beautiful jewelry in a white dress Do not have flowers in your hair. Listen to you. You are hurting yourself! Wake up, Elis! Wake up! Go on. Play. Pretend I'm not here. I like to look at your mouth when you play. Can I talk to you about Elis in private? Wait, just a moment. Yes, that's it. With a straight face as always. I can never catch it. - Did it go well? - Very good. I know you will show up! You let us down, coward. I do not have any choice. - Be brave, you have the guts. - Is Eric here? Yes, in the box, left stand. Elis, have you just arrived? Come on. This way to the stage. I don't sing. - Is Sophie here? - Yes, she's next. Give her this. She wears it all the time. Go and give it to her. I want her to wear it on stage. -do not be afraid. -I'm scared of the stage! everything will be fine. - From Elis. - She's so nice! Help me. She is so kind! Hurry! You are next! - When did you see Elis? - A few minutes ago. She behaved oddly and was dressed in white. - Where is she in front? - The box in front. Elis! - Can I sit next to you? - No, I want to be alone. Go away! Leave me alone! Give me the bottle! Don't let me hurt you! you ruined it. Silly girl! You are going to stage the death of the theater. Look. Sophie's heartbreak made her Isolde. Isolde will die, but not Sophie. you are wrong. Sophie will become Isolde. Sophie will die because of Eric. Your suicide pales in comparison to that. Your death is tragic and insignificant. Your beautiful clothes will be covered with blankets, Because corpses are disgusting. Look. Sophie knows how to die with dignity. Her progress is astonishing. - Hello. - Hello, Master. Sophie, awesome! Incredible progress! I tell Clement that suffering will improve your voice. I've seen you cry so many times, it's great! scientists found Your singing voice improves when you cry. you produce more mucus, the nasal diaphragm swells Make the sound lower. Marie, how about she and I sing Desdemona? She wasn't ready to sing Wagner on stage yesterday, But I think she can sing Verdi. absolute! I said to the director. I'm sure I can convince him. thanks! thanks! Elis, we all live miserably. Sophie sings poignantly because she's in grief. You have made a great singer. Right here. I give you back, But you have to tell me when you want to use it. - I promise. - Elis! - Say you're not mad. - I won't be mad at you. Clement, Eric is calling your name for you. I better leave. Remember what you promised me. I promise. You bring me luck. I will sing Desdemona. - Really? - I'm so happy! Look. It's not hard to forget him now. Yes. Don't you think he's a little hunched? - But he's so young. - I bet he's 40! Don Juan is also the same age. He looked so small from a distance. We pretend it was all a dream.
