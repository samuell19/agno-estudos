[ Woman Narrating ] IN THE LATTER DAYS OF THE 20th CENTURY, THERE AROSE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION. THE LEADING EXPERTS AT THE TIME BELIEVED A NUCLEAR WAR... WOULD ONLY INVOLVE THE EXCHANGE OF A FEW BOMBS, AND THEN THE SUITABLY HORRIFIED COMBATANTS WOULD SIT DOWN AT THE PEACE TABLE. THEY WERE WRONG. IN JUST TEN DAYS, 10,000 YEARS OF HUMAN PROGRESS WAS VIRTUALLY BLOWN TO DUST. TEN YEARS LATER, THEY TRIED AGAIN. HEY, SQUID LIPS ! WHAT YOU GOT THERE, EH ? YOU NOT ONLY UGLY, SQUID LIPS, YOU ARE STUPID. THIS IS GOOD FOR NOTHIN' ! [ Hammer Clicks ] HEY. YOU KNOW THE LAW. GREENERS CAN'T HAVE GUNS. [ Croaks ] [ Man ] RAPE ? YOU GOT THAT WRONG, FRIEND. ANYBODY WHO SAYS ANY DIFFERENT IS A LIAR. LIAR ? YOUR LIAR WAS MY DAUGHTER. I THINK I'LL START HERE. - CAPTAIN DEVLIN ! - HOW THE HELL DID YOU GET IN HERE ? WITH THIS. AND THIS. AND WHAT THE HELL DOES MEDTECH WANT HERE ? HIM. THIS PRISONER IS ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. YOUR DAUGHTER HAS CHANGED HER STORY. ONCE SHE FOUND OUT SHE WAS PREGNANT, SHE MUST HAVE HAD A CHANGE OF HEART. PREGNANT ? THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. [ Scoffs ] THAT'S WHAT WE THOUGHT TOO, UNTIL WE RAN SOME TESTS. THIS MAN IS CARRYING A LOADED WEAPON, AND MEDTECH, ON A PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY, NOW CLAIMS IT. NO, THIS MAN IS A SCAVENGER AND A THIEF, AND HE PREYS ON YOUNG WOMEN. WE KNOW HIS RECORD, AND YOURS. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE BEING REASSIGNED TO THE BORDER. THERE'S A TRUCK WAITING OUTSIDE. [ Both Grunt ] YOU'RE STILL HERE ? UHH ! SOME PEOPLE THINK WOMEN ARE RUNNIN' TOO MANY THINGS. AND YOU-- IF YOU EVER GET OUT FROM UNDER THE SKIRTS OF THE MEDTECHS, I'LL BE THERE. [ Woman on P.A. ] DR. INGRAM TO HEMATOLOGY, STAT. DR. INGRAM TO HEMATOLOGY, STAT. NURSE METHENY, REPORT TO SPERM BANK. YOUR SPECIMENS ARE READY. CODE BLUE, MATERNITY. CODE BLUE, MATERNITY. REPEAT: CODE BLUE, MATERNITY. IS THIS ACCURATE ? [ Woman On P.A. Continues ] PAGING DR. HOWARD, DR. FINE, DR. HOWARD. MR. HELLMAN, I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE SO POPULAR WITH THE LADIES. YOU'VE LEFT A STRING OF PREGNANCIES EVERYWHERE YOU'VE BEEN. IS THAT A FACT ? YOU HAVE THE HIGHEST SPERMATOZOAN COUNT WE'VE EVER TESTED. MUST'VE BEEN ALL THAT FIBER I ATE WHEN I WAS A KID. I'M AUTHORIZED TO OFFER YOU A CLEAN SLATE-- ALL CHARGES DROPPED. MEDTECH'S MAIN ASSIGNMENT IS TO LOCATE AND IMPREGNATE FERTILE WOMEN IN THE WASTELANDS. WE NEED POTENT YOUNG MEN IN THE FIELDS TO ASSIST IN THIS GREAT WORK. MEN WHO CAN TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES, WHO KNOW THE TERRITORY, WHO CAN PERFORM UNDER DIFFICULT CONDITIONS. - DO YOU FEEL UP TO IT ? - ARE YOU SERIOUS ? MAYBE YOU'D RATHER WE SENT YOU BACK TO DEVLIN. ON THE OTHER HAND, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A PATRIOT. [ Woman On P.A. ] ORDERLY TO CENTRAL SUPPLY. SIGN THIS. WAR REDUCED OUR MALE POPULATION BY 68 PERCENT. IT MADE MOST OF THE HUMAN RACE STERILE. BUT WE'RE STILL AT WAR. A POPULATION WAR. EACH SIDE IS DESPERATE TO REBUILD AND REARM. NOW, THAT REQUIRES MANPOWER. MANPOWER REQUIRES PEOPLE, AND THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN. DAMN. IT'S STUCK. IT'S AN ELECTRONIC LOCK. ONLY WE HAVE THE CODE. THE E.C.R. STAYS ON AT ALL TIMES. RIGHT. HELP ME GET THIS OFF. IT'S IN HERE. YOU SIGNED. IT STAYS ON. WELL, HOW-- H-HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO-- YOU KNOW. THERE'S A FLAP. IT MONITORS YOUR PHYSIOSEXUAL CONDITION. IT'S FOR YOUR OWN PROTECTION. AFTER ALL, IT'S GOVERNMENT EQUIPMENT NOW. THIS IS A PRERECORDED BRIEFING... MADE PRIOR TO YOUR SELECTION FOR THIS MISSION, AND WHICH, FOR SECURITY REASONS OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE, HAS BEEN KNOWN ONLY TO THE PRIME COUNCIL OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT. EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO A TRIBE OF MUTANT GREENERS... AMBUSHED THE 7th MOBILE BRIGADE OF THE BORDER PATROL. TWO HUNDRED AND TEN WOMEN AND MEN WERE BRUTALLY MASSACRED. WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SEVERAL CIVILIANS TRAVELING WITH THE BRIGADE... HAVE BEEN TAKEN HOSTAGE. THE REBEL GREENERS POSSESSED FIREARMS... IN STRICT CONTRAVENTION TO THE MUTANT ISOLATION ACT. EXCEPT FOR A LEAD THAT THE FIREARMS WERE OBTAINED SOMEWHERE NEAR FROGTOWN, HOW AND FROM WHOM THE WEAPONS WERE OBTAINED... IS STILL A TOTAL MYSTERY. [ Woman On P.A. ] RESUPPLY FLIGHT NOW APPROACHING. OW. OVER HERE. THIS IS CENTINELLA. WATCH HIM FOR ME, CORPORAL. [ Woman On P.A. ] WILL THE DRIVER OF THE A.T.C. CLEAR THE RUNWAY IMMEDIATELY. I'M NOT GOING IN THAT. YOU DON'T RIDE, WE'LL DRAG YOU ON A CHAIN. GET IN, STUD. YOUR EQUIPMENT. TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM. THERE AREN'T MANY LIKE HIM LEFT. I'LL DO MY DUTY. I KNOW YOU WILL. WHAT'S THE MATTER, SOLDIER ? YOU DON'T LOOK HAPPY. SUIT YOURSELF. BUT WHATEVER YOU ARE, WE'RE DAMN LUCKY TO HAVE YOU. MEDTECH NEEDS EVERY HAND IT CAN GET. WE'RE STILL AT WAR, YOU KNOW. YEAH ? WHICH WAY TO THE FRONT ? DON'T YOU TAKE ANYTHING SERIOUSLY ? I USED TO TAKE EVERYTHING SERIOUSLY. THEN THEY BLEW IT UP. [ Snoring ] AWW. I CAN END IT ALL HERE, RIGHT NOW. THROW YOUR BODIES ACROSS THE LINE, SEE THAT THE GREENERS GOT YA. OR NOT. - THEY'LL GUN YOU DOWN. - [ Gun Cocks ] LET'S SEE WHO DROPS FIRST, ME OR YOU. HEY, WHOA, WHOA, LET'S JUST ALL-- SHUT UP. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, WE'RE GOING THROUGH. LET THEM PASS. HEY, LADY, YOU JUST ABOUT GOT MY ASS SHOT OFF BACK THERE. NOW WE'RE GOING INTO HOSTILE MUTANT TERRITORY AT FULL THROTTLE. DAMN, I HOPE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOIN'. I HATE TO THINK YOU'RE JUST LOST. WE'RE GOING TO FROGTOWN. THEIR LEADER, COMMANDER TOTY, HAS KIDNAPPED SOME PILGRIMS WHO WANDERED INTO THEIR TERRITORY. AND WHAT'S THAT TO MEDTECH ? THEY ARE FERTILE WOMEN. WHY WOULD MUTANTS WANT TO KIDNAP HUMAN FEMALES ? RANSOM. TOTY KNOWS HOW VALUABLE FERTILES ARE TO MEDTECH. OR MAYBE HE WANTS THEM FOR HIS HAREM. AW, THAT'S DISGUSTING. YEAH, AND WE'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. WE'RE GONNA GET 'EM OUT, AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA GET 'EM PREGNANT. [ Whispers ] PRE-- ARE YOU SURE YOU REALLY WANNA GET YOURSELF ON THE RESERVATION ? DON'T RUST YOUR DIAPER, STUD. THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS JOYRIDE. NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT, MIND IF I TAKE A LITTLE STROLL ? - WHY ? - I GOTTA WATER THE ROSES. NO ARMED ESCORT ? YOU'RE NOT GOING FAR. NO, JUST RIGHT THERE BEHIND THAT BUSH. BE RIGHT BACK. SEE YA LATER, SISTERS. MUCH LATER. YAH-HAH ! [ Beeping ] [ Alarm Sounding ] [ Groaning, Grunting ] [ Alarm Continues Sounding ] IF ANYONE BUT ME TRIES TO UNLOCK THE E.C.R., A ONE-OUNCE CHARGE OF PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE WILL DETONATE. - [ Beep ] - [ Gasps, Exhaling ] BEYOND A CERTAIN POINT, THE PROXIMITY SENSOR IN MY EARRING... ACTIVATES THE E.C.R. ELECTRONIC STINGER. AS YOU CAN SEE, IT CAN BE QUITE PAINFUL, BUT NOT TERRIBLY DAMAGING. AND IF YOU GET LOST, MY DIRECTIONAL FINDER WILL LEAD ME RIGHT TO YOU. FOR THE REST OF THIS MISSION, YOU AND I ARE LIKE ONE UNIT. REMEMBER THAT, SOLDIER. [ Sighs ] [ Exhales ] [ Sighs ] HEY, YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK TERRIFIC IN THIS LIGHT. SEE YOU IN THE MORNING. I JUST THOUGHT A MAN OF YOUR REPUTATION MIGHT STILL BE HUNGRY. I'M FULL. ARE YOU SURE ? WELL, MAYBE NOT. [ Alarm Sounds ] WAAAH ! I'M SORRY ! I'M SORRY ! I WAS JUST-- DID SOMEONE TEACH YOU, OR ARE YOU JUST A TEASE BY NATURE ? I WAS JUST FOLLOWING ORDERS. ORDERS ? REGULATION 12: KEEP THE SUBJECT IN AN EXCITED STATE. IT PROMOTES POTENCY. OH, POTENCY ? I WAS JUST DOING MY JOB. GOOD. WHEN WE GET BACK, I'LL HAVE THEM GIVE YOU A RAISE. OHH ! [ Groans ] [ Centinella Giggles ] [ Whispers ] GOD. [ Sighs ] I HATE THE ARMY. SHH ! WE CAN'T MAKE ANY NOISE. THIS IS AGAINST REGULATIONS. HUH ? I'M NOT FERTILE. THEY DON'T WANT YOU WASTING YOURSELF. WELL, THEN WHY-- I HEARD STORIES ABOUT YOU. I WANTED TO SEE IF THEY WERE TRUE. OH, PE-- PEOPLE TALK TOO MUCH. [ Moans ] CAN'T BLAME 'EM. WITH MALE RATIONING THE LAST FEW YEARS, WOMEN GET LONELY. HOW DO I-- THERE'S A FLAP. [ Flap Springs Open ] [ Moaning ] CENTINELLA, I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN LIVE UP TO YOUR EXPECTATIONS. I'D SAY YOU WERE ALREADY UP TO 'EM. HOLY SHIT ! [ Grunts ] YOU'RE OUT OF UNIFORM, CORPORAL. YOU KNOW, YOU TWO LADIES MUST HAVE MOONS FOR BALLS. NOBODY GOES ON THE RESERVATION, NOT EVEN THE BORDER PATROL. HOW THE HELL ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GET 'EM OUT ? WITH A PLAN. THAT'S NO PLAN, THAT'S A PLOT-- TO MURDER ME. I'M HAVIN' NO PART OF IT. YOU SIGNED A CONTRACT. YEAH, TO FUCK FOR FREEDOM. BUT I AIN'T MEETIN' MY MAKER IN FROGTOWN. THAT'S NOT IN MY CONTRACT. PAGE 12, SUBPARAGRAPH 8. IF WE CAN'T GET THE GIRLS OUT, YOUR FIELD POTENCY WILL THEN BE UTILIZED. OKAY, OKAY. BUT WHAT IF I GET THEM PREGNANT AND WE'RE STILL IN FROGTOWN ? WHAT HAPPENS TO ME ? FULFILL ALL THE TERMS OF YOUR CONTRACT, AND YOU WON'T EVER HAVE TO FIND OUT. - OH, YEAH ? - YEAH. - YEAH ? - YEAH ! HYAH ! WHAT ? LET'S RENEGOTIATE, HUH ? [ Door Slams ] [ Hellman ] YEAH ? [ Beeping ] AWW ! WHOA-OHH ! [ Beeping Continues ] [ Beeping Continues ] [ Beeping Stops ] [ Panting Heavily ] [ Beeping ] WHAT ? NOT YOU. THE MOTION TRACKER. [ Beeping Continues ] WE GOT A LIVE ONE. - LET'S CHECK IT OUT. GET IN. - GET IN ? [ Beeping Continues ] VEER LEFT. MORE LEFT ! GO RIGHT. [ Gasping ] IT'S MOVING. IT'S STILL MOVING. MORE LEFT, MORE LEFT. RIGHT ! [ Panting ] - [ Beeping Continues ] - [ Hellman ] THERE IT IS ! ACCORDING TO THE TESTS I JUST RAN ON HER, SHE'S FERTILE. QUITE A FIND OUT HERE. WHERE ARE YOU FROM ? IDENTIFY YOURSELF. YOU'RE SCARIN' HER. OKAY, PRINCE CHARMING, YOU TRY. OKAY. DON'T BE AFRAID. SOUP. COME HERE. IT'S GOOD FOR YOU. THAT'S A GIRL. THERE YOU GO. GOOD FOR YOU. [ Grunting ] SHE DON'T LIKE YOUR COOKING EITHER. [ Moaning ] EASY, SPANGLE. WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' ? OHH ! SHH. [ Whimpering ] SHE'S NO GOOD TO US TRAUMATIZED. GO GET READY FOR WORK. [ Steady Beeping ] YOU CAN START NOW. WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT ? THE GIRL. I'VE INJECTED HER WITH OVEDOL TO FACILITATE PROCREATION. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE. REMEMBER ? JUST LIKE THAT ? YEAH. SHE'S OVULATING, AND YOU'VE GOT A HIGH COUNT. LET'S GO. I CAN'T WORK LIKE THIS. COME ON, HELLMAN. IT'S LATE, AND I'M TIRED. SHE'S NEVER EVER BRUSHED HER TEETH. [ Sighs ] WHAT IS THE MATTER ? WELL, SHE'S NOT MY TYPE. YOUR TYPE ? YEAH. - YOU HAVE PREFERENCES ? - WELL, YEAH. IF I KINDA KNOW HER AND THERE'S A LITTLE CHEMISTRY THERE-- AND A LITTLE ATMOSPHERE WOULD BE NICE. NEXT YOU'RE GONNA BE TELLING ME YOU HAVE TO BE IN LOVE FIRST. MAYBE YOU OUGHTA TRY MAKING LOVE TO A COMPLETE STRANGER... IN THE MIDDLE OF A HOSTILE MUTANT TERRITORY AND SEE HOW YOU LIKE IT ! YOU NEED INSPIRATION. [ Scoffs ] [ Zipper Unzips ] WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' ? RELAX. I'VE BEEN TRAINED IN SEDUCTION TECHNIQUES. RIGHT. [ Moans ] I'M NOT A MACHINE YOU CAN JUST TURN ON AND OFF WHENEVER YOU WANT TO, YOU KNOW. AW, COME ON. [ Sighs ] [ Exhales ] I GUESS I'M GONNA HAVE TO LIVE UP TO MY CONTRACT. SPANGLE, PUT YOUR BLOUSE ON. COME ON, PUT YOUR BLOUSE ON. TAKE YOUR GLASSES OFF. [ Moans, Giggles ] [ Moaning Continues ] [ Croaks ] YOU CLEAN HER UP ? NOT ME. I'M GRABBIN' SOME DOWN TIME. OKAY. FROGTOWN IS BACK THAT WAY. HOW FAR ? I RAN ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT. WHERE ARE THE OTHER GIRLS ? THEY'RE IN COMMANDER TOTY'S PALACE. WHY DIDN'T THEY ESCAPE WITH YOU ? THEY'RE FROM AN ORDER OF PASSIVES. RESISTANCE IS NOT THEIR WAY. THEY BELIEVE ONLY THE TRULY MEEK WILL INHERIT THE EARTH. RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, GO SOUTH FOR A FEW DAYS. THE BORDER PATROL WILL PICK UP YOUR SIGNAL AND EVAC YOU TO A MEDTECH HOSPITAL. NO, NO, NO, DON'T WORRY. MOTHERS ARE NATIONAL HEROES. YOU'LL BE TREATED LIKE A QUEEN. THANK YOU. [ Door Opens, Slams ] HOLD THESE. PUT THOSE ON ME. NOW I'M YOUR PRISONER. OH, I THINK I'M GONNA LIKE THAT. [ Chuckling ] AW, WHAT'S WRONG, BABY ? DON'T LIKE BEING TREATED LIKE A PUPPET ON A STRING ? NOW YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL. - GOOD COVER ? - THE BEST. WATCH FOR MY SIGNAL. TIE THIS AROUND MY WAIST. DON'T TRY TO TAKE MY EARRINGS. IF THEY LOSE CONTACT WITH MY BODY, YOUR EQUIPMENT BLOWS. IF YOU GET TOO FAR AWAY, YOUR EQUIPMENT BLOWS. IF YOU DON'T DO EXACTLY WHAT I SAY, YOUR EQUIPMENT BLOWS. UNDERSTOOD ? DID ANYBODY EVER TELL YOU YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL PERSONALITY ? MOVE OUT. I DIDN'T THINK SO. [ Chokes ] ?? [ Humming ] WOULD YOU STOP WITH THE CHAIN ? ?? [ Continues Humming ] WE HAVE TO TRUST EACH OTHER NOW. OUR LIVES DEPEND ON IT. WHAT ? YOU LOOK GOOD. SHALL WE ?

PLAN ? IT WAS A PLOT TO MURDER ME. I OUGHT TO KICK YOUR BUTT. OH, JUST TRY IT, BUSTER. STOP. WHY ? YOU GOTTA SAVE YOURSELF FOR FERTILES. I HAVE ENOUGH. OH, NO, YOU DON'T.
