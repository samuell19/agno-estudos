That day, under the protection of Saint Clothilde, the boss of the light aviation, those two love birds decided to get married. At that time of the story, Victoire Bonhomme wasn't thinking about her future husband, but of a garbage truck. Behind a garbage truck! Hey, Sasha, calm down. My name is not Sasha. Mom, just park anywhere and walk. You're already 45 minutes late. You guys are driving me insane. Your father didn't want to come to your wedding this morning. I had to put on his suit. I'll do as fast as I can. What does that guy want? I knew it! You are Albert Bonhomme! Yeah, that's me. You see, I knew it, it's him! You were so amazing in King Lear! Oh really you have seen King Lear? Don't worry, Father. Sorry Sylvain, we need to begin. Yes, I understand. I just need to go... and see where... Or else we can postpone. Don't postpone. It's OK. My little pussy cat! We can't wait any longer. Who is going to walk me to the altar? Where is your brother? Sylvain, you really need to go. Alright. Where are you? I'm here but there's nobody. But where, here? Where here? At Saint Odile. Why? But it's Saint Clotilde not Saint Odile! Calm down. Don't talk to me that way! You should be happy that I'm here. People would pay to have Tim Bonhomme. But you're my brother! There's no proof of that! If it's for a donation, forget it. I really like your style. You watch the show? OK, so what should I write, Father? - Mark. - Father Mark. Father Mark Ronson! Kidding. Are you crazy? What did I say? My father will walk you to the altar. No way! You're not my father! Let me go! I can't get married without my family. I'm your family now, pussy cat. Your name is Chamoux, now. Bonhomme is over. - No, it's not over. - Get in the church. Let me go! Lay a hand on my daughter, I will kill you! And cut! Great, very convincing, let's do it simple. It's not a movie. I'm going to marry your daughter, like it or not. Stop everything. What are you talking about? I don't know if I should marry you. Are you kidding me? Fuck! No. Marrying me is your only way of becoming someone. That's what you think of me? I'm good for nothing but your wife? You didn't put underwear? No it's OK. It's OK. Good morning. Please have a seat. So... The terms of your stay here: (1) You dispose of your room. (2) Of the refrigerator and freezer. (3) The taxi subscription, you're not ready for the metro. And 4, very important, access to the TV room: DVD and CD, only if - do you understand? - you put them back in their case after watching or listening to them. Nicole, what are you doing? It's too big. I think I took it too big. Why did you change the couch again? I was bored of the color. So, next week, the payment of your allowance, 30 euros a week, just like before. And what if I put it there? 30 euros a week? No, it's not going to work. That's what we gave your brother until his 30th birthday. If it doesn't suit you, rent a place. I don't have a job anymore. Told you, don't work free for the Chamoux. Cut it in half and I'll have 2 of them! Not so bad. Why don't you see Jean-Marie at France Culture? He always asks after you. Maybe he'll take you back? It was an internship. He thought you were great! It's not paid. Honey, are we going to Hallyday's birthday? But... Nicole, I'm rehearsing everyday! It's in the evening. But in the evening I'm in my part, The Imaginary Invalid, part of my life. Dumb fool. Burgundy is nice... It goes with everything. Sit straight, you look like a teenager. No, no, nothing has changed But everything continued No, no, nothing has changed But everything continued Are you kidding me? You think I'll accept your old fashioned terms? I'm almost 30 years old. So, I'm getting out of here, I'm getting a job, I'm flying the coop! I've warned you, rather die than have my birthday here. Son of a bitch. I'm so happy to have you back home. Have a nice day my little princess. Thanks, Dad. No man will love you as much as I do. You know that? It was 9:44am that Monday November 2nd, when she knew she was trapped like a rat. Tomorrow I will welcome Blanche de Richemont with her latest book Divine Inspiration. You're listening to France Culture. It's 1pm, it's time for the news. - So what are your skills? - I know how to write. Oh really? What do you write? I write for myself. I write songs. You sing? You do music? No, I write songs but there's no music. So it's poetry. No, it's not poetry. - Did you listen to it? - Of course I did. - So? What did you think? - It's good. - Really? - It's very good. Feeling down. Come quick. Tim. It's charming, it's really good. - I'm really happy. - I'm proud of you, carry on. Thank you. I don't have poetry section in my show. And as much as I admire your father, I have nothing for you. Or maybe an internship? I knew it. How was my paper on the Strindberg play? It's quite confusing what you write. Hello. Our new recruit, Alice Perron. Victoire Bonhomme, Albert's daughter and sister of... Tim, yes, a real asshole. Sorry but... I'm used to it. It's said he's a great lover, anyways... Question of point of view. It's you. You asked me to come. I'll open up. Promise me that you'll never leave me. - Always take care of me. - Promise. - You know I'm emotional. - I know. I'm emotional. I took this apartment for her and she left me. I bet it cost you. Fuck, Vicky! I'm not talking about money, it's about love. But true, it cost me a fortune. I'll never be able to live without her. You've only known her for 2 weeks. Yeah but we saw each other everyday. It's really big. I know. Last night, couldn't find the toilets. Put it... Put it... there. Be careful, it's heavy, it's hifi. Are you going to do a guest room? No. No, I don't have any guests. I don't have anybody, anyways. I think I'll do a home cinema. You think I can stay here for a while? I don't mind if you watch movies while I sleep. What? No, darling, I love you, I adore you, but right now I need to be alone and refocus. The toilets are that way. Do you have a job for me on your show? Even as a runner? A job? No but an internship whenever you want. Do internships to get jobs. Stop acting like you're a princess. What did you expect? Starting on the top? Wake up, Vicky! You're nobody. Tim Bonhomme! Oh my god, I can't believe it. I'm so happy. This is incredible. So am I. - What's your name? - Karine. Just like me. Do I look OK, Vicky? Great. That's it. I love you. Can I kiss you? Go for it. It's my gift. The Tim show it's... Hot hot hot! You don't know what that feels like. Fame. When you feel like shit, it's hell. Sometimes I think you're lucky to be nobody. Damn, a taxi. I'm going. Sorry. I didn't ask, how are you? Not so good. Let's go please. Darling, I love you. Me too. I'll show you if I'm nobody. A problem with athletes? Who do you think you are? Nobody, asshole. You fucking lunatic. Victoire just measured the adversity she'll have to struggle against. Bonhomme? And realized it was time to move her ass. - Tim Bonhomme? - I'm his sister. It's for me. And to end this morning show, the singer Mee's new song, who will be at the Olympia soon. Miss? Excuse me? Miss? Where are we going now? How much is the fare? Around 2000. OK. Good. Let's go back. Bernard, another lemonade please. You're not feeling well, are you? Your drink ain't gonna help you love life. Hi Bernard. What's up Banjo? A beer, please. We pay the musicians after the show. So serious. - Hi. - Hi Albert! Hi, Jean. How are you? - What can I get you? - Nothing. Of course. Argan. Yes, Argan. Hi, Helene. Let's go home, Bobby. He's gone. Don't want to see your father? Can't face my folks tonight. He wasn't gonna stay here anyways. He likes to mingle when he's anxious. I fell like I've been sentenced for life. Chamoux. My parents. Doomed forever. Since she was a little girl, she's got the King under her skin. Wait a second. I'm sick of it. Sorry, it just turns me off. I understand, it's not a big deal. Do you know that you really look like Elvis? - No, it's a lollipop. - Sorry. You have the same voice, it's insane. I know. Good night, kids! Bye, Bernard. - What's your name? - Banjo. - Because you play banjo? - No. - Where are you going? - To the Meka. Nice. But where is it? Where is it? I thought I was gonna see Albert or Tim. Sorry. You're not famous. Neither are you. No one pulls strings for me. My father wasn't a taxi driver. One day, I drove the son of Kenny Rogers. Justin. Nice guy. Do you know him? Good night. Hey Cinderella, are you lost? Actually, I'm looking for Banjo. Yeah, he's over there in the back. You see? But you know he has a small dick. I'm kidding. Are you always that serious? Victoire Bonhomme, like a fellow. Yann like a... A lemonade? Are you sick? Stomach ache? A baby? No? Aurore, 5 shots please. Bottoms up! It's good, right? Can't buy a drink, didn't get my allowance yet. Don't worry, it's on me tonight. Hey Elvis. You've drunk enough. - Take care of the kid. - Don't worry. I'm fascinated by you. Since I was a little girl I'm crazy about Elvis. I'm not Elvis. "I say Angelique "I have a piece of news for you or perhaps." What is it! It's not mine. "You have been asked of me in marriage." Damn it! What the hell is this? Nicole! What's the matter? What's the matter? Look. Great Party! You find that funny? Well yes. She's having fun. It's fun to write on your breast? Isn't there paper for that? Don't you see it's like the Femen? The Femen! They risk their lives to oppose to dictatorship. It's a political act that leads to prison. They're not writing "Great party, Mom" So melodrama with your repressive measures. She needs to let it go. I'm not Poutine. You're not Obama, either. I find it very creative. Do the same if you feel oppressed. And this? What do you think? A table to go with the couch? I don't have time to take care of that and your daughter. I'm playing tomorrow. The premiere is in one month. Well yes that's tomorrow! So tell me, tonight, who am I sleeping with, Argan the Invalid or Albert, my husband? Neither. I don't have time for jokes. What about a new baldachin bed. - What's wrong Cinderella? - Nothing it's just... You're not a virgin at least? No, I lost my virginity with a horse. Wait a minute! That's disgusting! I went riding bareback and he was thin. - Wait! - What's wrong? Do you have a drink? I need more... Are you OK? Are you OK? This thing is incredible! Did you just get out of prison or what? No, she didn't just get out of prison, Victoire just had her first orgasm. Claude? Is that you? Who's Claude? Mom! Claude has a hair! Mom? Claude has a hair! I don't know why she called me Claude. In reference to Claude Monet's waterlily. The fact remains that I'm her vagina, and my name is Claude. I came! I came! I came! I had an orgasm for the first time! Hey! - Wonderful! - Thank you very much. Where have you been? I know, I'm screwed. What's that smell? Your father is in his office. What did you say, Samia? She smells like sex. That's a point of view. But she does. A little... I forgot what it smelled like. "How is that. You're smiling." - I'll leave you to your work. - No, stay here. Sit here. You can't do that to us. A text, a call, is it too much to ask? I sent a text to Mom. Yes, I know. Next time, when you're a Femen, just write, "sleeping out, don't worry, I'm fine." I'm not Kim Kardashian, it doesn't fit. Who? I was out of battery. I don't care! You must respect the house rules. I'm not 12! I spent the night with... I don't want to hear about it! - What's wrong? - Guess what? She popped her cherry. What? Albert. It's just an image. Samia, is there some cake left? Two days ago you wore a wedding dress, today you're sleeping out, drinking... Dad. I know the smell of debauchery. What is wrong with you, Victoire? You find this amusing? No but I just slept with a guy. I don't want to hear about it! It's not a crime. You know the consequence on my work? On your work? Yes, I didn't go to rehearsal today. - Why? - Because I was worried. I was waiting for you. Dad, everything is fine. Go take a shower. You smell like... What is going on? Nicole! Come here. You think this is normal? Well what? You asked her to take a shower. Mom... I think I had an orgasm... No, I had an orgasm for the first time. For the first time? Isn't it a funny feeling? It's like something unclogged my throat. Unclogged my throat right away. You know what? Let's celebrate! Get dressed. And Claude came back. Not the Claude story again. With a hangover, nothing is better than a beer. Do you like it? I love it! Do you miss it? Everyday. Sometimes I wish that our floor changes to ice. You were right leaving Chamoux, you'd ended up like me. We never go out, we do nothing. Your father, like your brother, it's all about them. I'm not sliding anymore, I decorate. Why do you stay? I'm not going to leave your father now. And you know what, I love that jerk. Anyways, no other man dared to hit on me. Why? Because I'm Albert Bonhomme's wife. Banjo? How's it going? Can I check something with you please? What? Is this Yann's number? Why? It's weird, he's not answering. It's not weird. He's a womanizer, it's normal. That's the thing with having sex the first night. - I'm not a whore. - I didn't say that. Hi Bernard. Finally! - A beer, please. - No, go get your gear first. - Still so serious. - Critical times. - Hi Bernard! - What's up kid? So, what are you going to sing? - I'm not Elvis. - I know. What do you want from me? Sing something else since you're not Elvis. Because in fact I write songs. There's no music, so people say it's poetry. But it's not. I know they are songs. Look. I wrote this earlier today. It just came while I was in my bath. So read it. If you like it, do a melody, and we can sing together. You know how to sing? Stop it! Last drink to heat up my voice. - Mom, what are you doing here? - Good evening. It's such a pleasure to see you. It's been so long. Yes but it's Albert's private turf here. Each has his territory. Well, that's a shame. You're much more sexy than he is. Thank you. - Can I get you a drink? - No, I have to go home. No, you're staying. No, your father likes me to be home when he gets in. Mom, you're sliding. Just one drink then. I start. It's the story of a sun that I was hoping for It's the story of love that I believed alive It's the story of a beautiful day that as a child I wished, very happy for all the world I wished, I hoped that peace would rule that night of Christmas but it continued But everything continued But everything continued No no nothing has changed But everything continued No no nothing has changed But everything continued And yet a lot of people sang with us And yet people got down on their knees to pray Yes to pray Each day I saw on TV the same night of Christmas guns, canons. I cried Yes I cried No no nothing has changed But everything continued No no nothing has changed But everything continued It's a story about a truce that I asked for It's a story about a sun that I hoped for It's a story of love, that I thought was alive It's the story of a beautiful day that as a child I wished, very happy for all the world I wished, I hoped that peace would rule that night of Christmas But everything continued But everything continued No no nothing has changed But everything continued No no nothing has changed But everything continued Nicole? Victoire? Bobby? I didn't know your daughter sang. Neither did I. She changed since yesterday. What happened? She got unclogged. To you. To you. Did you see how Bernard hit on me? He came out of the forest tonight and he wanted more than kiss. Those weren't eyes, but his fly. He wouldn't have said no, believe me. You know, with his tool box, he'd screw me room by room. Mom, what are you doing? Two seconds. With your Ukelele, not ready to happen. You really know how to sing. You really got unclogged. - Good evening Mrs. Bonhomme. - Hi Eric. How's the boiler working? That's it. What's that? Look, it's a picture of Tim. "So you'll avoid taking taxis to Marseilles. "Love, your brother." To Marseilles? I'll explain later. - Mom, it doesn't fit. - Yes it does. - No it doesn't fit. - Yes it does. It's the key of the car. Wait. What are you doing? - She said... - I was saying it's the car key. Victoire, you've been drinking again? Yes, but I was with Mom. Yes. We celebrated, what's his name? Bernard's birthday. Yes, we celebrated Bernard. Why wasn't I invited? You were in your part. We thought you'd say you're in your part. Because you were in your part. Yeah. Fine. Yes. Where is Bobby? Eight o'clock, can't help myself The night is here, I need a drink Eight o'clock, I'm in need The day is gone, my glass of wine I'm an alcoholic It's magic I don't feel well without my glass of wine After, we take it from the start. It might be a little too high for you. I'm an alcoholic It's magic I don't feel well without my glass of wine Rum rum rum And Coke I love it. - That's the beginning. - A glass of wine? - I want you - I don't understand - I love your body - OK fine - We're in bed - A heart on the run - Feeling dizzy - I throw up on him We give it a try, we talk about us We find that crazy, we have a drink - We can try - To deprive - We can love - And be drunk I'm an alcoholic It's magic I don't feel well without my glass of wine I'm an alcoholic It's magic I don't feel well without my glass of wine You're so beautiful, another beer I think I love you, another drink You're a mess, but you seem nice I don't feel well, I think I'm drunk We are alcoholics It's magic We don't feel well without our glass of wine We are alcoholics It's magic We don't feel well without our glass of wine I really want your lips on my dick too. I admit that was a little too much. Good night. You seem weird. What's going on? You did something to your hair? Something changed. Mom, she changed her hair. And so did you. - Nothing. - I'm always the same. Always the same. - Shall we? - Let's go! And... I have a piece of news for you which, perhaps, you did not except. You have been asked in marriage. How is that? You are smiling? I ought to obey you, Father. Such an obedient daughter. It's my duty blindly to follow you. - Meet us at the lodge. - I'm coming. Wait, Mom! - Thank you. - See you soon. Yes, I'll call you... - Mom, we really have to go. - Wait a minute. - Let's go. Who cares. - We have to congratulate him. What are you doing? Samia went home. Bobby isn't well. So I have to bring him to the vet. What's wrong? It's not a big deal. Don't worry. I'll call you to let you know. You'll let me know? Yes. Promise, honey. Vicky, what are you doing? I'm going to a concert. At this time of night? Actually it's a late night performance, with a piano, like a happening. What are you going to do there? I didn't tell you. I'm a reviewer for France Culture. That's wonderful! Since when? What's your signature? I took an alias. Why? Are you ashamed of your name? You know, if I can avoid getting strings pulled. And what's your alias? What's your alias? Alice Perron. My alias is Alice Perron. Let's go, Alice! Congratulations. What a wonderful night. Thank you. - You must be tired? - I'm invalid. It's normal. How did you find Alice Perron? I meet her the other day. And you? Poor Bobby... It's the only thing I could think of. You father is in love with his dog. Where are the girls? Sorry, excuse me. Tim, my son. Mom went to the vet, Bobby has a problem. Your sister went to a happening or something for France Culture, she works there now. They lied. This is her job. I have sex on the first night Some people find that weird I don't make a fuss Some compare me to a hoe Call me a bitch or a slut and yet when a man does the same he's known as Don Juan I like making love Frankly, I like making love night and day I like making love Frankly, I like making love night and day I'm not a slut My body lives, my soul grows tired So men pass by In my bed they pile up Wishing for one to rock my world Wishing for just one It's not my destiny I like making love Sorry, excuse me. Move! Move all of you! You're excited by me sister? Continue singing Vicky. It's good! Come on. Keep on acting like a hoe. Carry on in front of these clowns. You know what you're doing? You're dishonoring the family name. Dad is ashamed. He's here. Stupid ass bitch. Stop bugging your sister now. Come on. I like making love Frankly I like making love night and day I like making love Frankly I like making love night and day You love making love! You love making love! How can you let her do that? Come on. You've slept with half of Paris, and because she's a girl she can't sing about sex? - It has nothing to do with that. - Oh yeah? Put a veil or a Burka. Cover her face. That way you'll feel better. That's enough. Let's go home. Mister Bonhomme? We were at the premiere. You were absolutely fabulous. What a great play! The future is assured! You can die in peace. My kids love the Tim Show. Hot hot hot! Yeah, it's hot. Yeah. Good evening, Madam. Good night. Yes, well good night. Bye. Touch me in the morning Come on Caress my breasts I'm staying with Vicky. How can you do this to me? And using Bobby to cover up her crap. I'm very proud of her. You're proud of a slut? Dad, forget it. Let's go. I love you I love you I love you. Don't be jealous of that guy I love you. I'm jealous I love you. Don't be jealous of that guy I love you. That's how it is He's a real nuisance. For a girl who just got bullied, you assured! Thanks. Good evening. Bravo! Good concert! Thanks. That's nice. I wanted to ask you, Is it true, sex on the first night? Is it true you're so dumb to believe it? - That's Mee you just snubbed. - You? Mee, the singer. - It was hard getting him here. - It's fine. You should have told me that he was coming. In fact, I do have sex the first night. I'm interested in sex the first night. I live nearby. I have the apartment to myself. My mom left for the weekend. Fuck, give me your lips. You say no, but one day, "bang bang"... Dad? It's me. You were amazing tonight. I was proud to be your daughter. I know you don't feel the same way. Sorry I lied but I had to. Well, I'm going to bed. Good night. Mom hasn't come home yet? And Dad? He left early this morning with Bobby. You want your porridge? We've been speaking for the last six days. Stop! Stop! Please. Think what you say. Don't think of what to say. Albert? Your daughter is here. Can I please have a minute alone? "I have sex the first night "Some people find that weird" Of course they do. It's shocking! Don't prostitutes do that? "I'm not a slut "My body lives "My soul grows tired "So men pass by "In my bed, they pile-up" What does that mean? A threesome? No. It's a girl who wants to free herself. And feels light. It's not vulgar. It's cute. It's cute? No, it's not cute! Wait. "I like to make love frankly "I like to make love night and day" Are you talking about nymphomania? It's not cute. It's a sickness. Are you a nymphomaniac? So why are you writing that? Victoire, words are important. Damn it! "Touch me in the morning" Really? Inspired by Diana Ross. If you knew her life. She wasn't a saint. And the ultimate for the end. "I'm an alcoholic, it's magic." It's also a sickness. People lose everything because of alcohol. It's not magic. It's poison. It kills. The song is not about that. Sometimes when you're a little drunk it helps to let it go when you're shy. Obviously, this isn't your case. Christophe, the runner, he's diabetic. His life is hell, so you can sing "I'm diabetic, it's magic." That's not what the song is about. I'm ashamed of you, Victoire. And you drag your mother with you. If I fail this part, it'll be your fault. Exclusively your fault. You and your brother tarnish my name. Should have married Chamoux, use his name. This name, I made it. It belongs to me. I won't let you ruin it. - It's called Vicky Banjo. - Shut up. As long as you live under my roof I forbid you to sing those songs. I did research, you don't have a public. You sing in hellholes. People don't even listen. If only you were at the Olympia. You have nothing to say. - Albert? - Yes. What? Françoise is waiting for you in the lodge. I'll be right there. Do you have any news from Mom? Banjo, it's you. What are you doing, it's been 2 hours. The concert is tonight. I'm not going to be able to come. What's going on? Victoire Bonhomme? That's me. I'm sorry but I can't. It's over. What do you mean it's over? What's your problem? You prefer Vicky Mee? It'll make things easier, for sure. Are you jealous? No, I'm not. Why should I be jealous? Tell me you're jealous. Say it! Is there a problem? No. Everything is fine. I get you. I get you. I get you. I get you. You get me? No. Can I get you a drink? - Do you want to see my boobs? - Yes. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. It's my brother. It's your brother? Around the world, it's a quarter past Around the world, it's too late Around the world, same way of the cross The same wave of cold air flow Around the world, it's 10 minutes past And the filthy beast resists Around the globe the same fanatics The same vain chiefs Long tears of blood All around, clubs and clans The world is smaller and smaller I don't remember what's next. - I love it. - Really? That's really sweet. But, you know, you do have sex the first night. Maurice, we have to leave at 11. Yes, I know. A picture please! Don't you already have 23 of them? It's for your collection. - You didn't come to the concert. - Yes I did. I didn't see you. See you soon. Do you want to come to Rouen with us? Come it's going to be fun. No. I'll leave you guys. It was a great night, Vicky. - You have great energy. - So do you. So girls, want to go to Rouen? - Yeah. Totally. - Come on! Let's go. Nice. It's always them. Pauline? Am I bothering you? Can I pass by your place? Wait! Wait! Turn it off. How are you? Are you happy? Are you happy? You screwed up your wedding. You fucked up your family. Congratulations! So you think sex with a celebrity makes you someone. I'm sorry to tell you but... he fucked you, he won't call back. You think I call the girls I fucked on the first night? No. I don't. Because this is not your world. This is for adults. Go to your room and pick up your toys. Do you have news from Mom? No. Of course you don't. I'm getting Bobby because you only think of yourself. I only think of myself? Wait. How dare you say that to me! - Shut up - Calm down. Listen to me! I'm tired of shutting my mouth! "Don't hurt Tim he's emotional." You think I don't have feelings? Can you feel that? My heart isn't made of stone. Asshole. Answer me. OK, Vicky. You have nothing to say now? Vicky, wait! What? Want to know where Mom is? She's with Bernard and she screws you too. Wait! Vicky! Miss? Miss? Come with me. Don't be afraid. Come. - Come with you? - Come with me. I'll come with you. Miss? Are you OK? Yes! Yes. Come. Yes. I'll come. I'll come. Good. How many fingers do I have? Come on. And now, how many fingers? And now? I'll come. OK, nice. How many fingers? With you. And now? How many fingers? It's easy, how many, Miss? Miss, there is 3 fingers. I need an answer. - With you. - With me, OK. Miss? Miss? Patrick, she's not answering. - Let's evacuate. Get the stretcher. - Roger that, sergeant. Please stay with me. What's your name? My name is Patrick, like my colleague. Answer to Patrick. To please Patrick. Ladies and gentlemen, is everyone here? Gentlemen. Please follow me. It happened so fast. What is that dog? Cashmere, the caretaker's dog. He wanted to be here. For Bobby, who loved us for who we are You know, I went on the Internet to see your videos. Your concerts. It's good. - Really? - It's awesome. You couldn't help yourself? - Of what? - Opening your big mouth. But you're right, even if it makes trouble, it's not your problem. Now that Bobby is gone, I have nobody. We are all going to miss him. I lost my dog. I can't lose my wife. You have to come home. You know, everything I do, theatre, films, it's all for you. I want you to be proud. I am proud. You're bored? A little. Can you feel it? The corpse still gets a hard on. Sorry Bobby. - Come on. We're going to be late. - Is it far? No, don't worry. It's not too far. You know I hate surprises. Yeah, but I think you'll like this one. VICKY BANJO Look. Looks good, right? Who's that guy? It's Mee. It's you? No, not me. It's Mee, the famous singer. Mee is the son of the composer, Maurice Mee. He's ashamed of his father's name? It's easier for him. Me I like Mee. It's like your sister who took the name Banjo. Banjo is the guitarist. What? Yeah. So, come on. Let's go. Victoire? Sylvain. Don't you recognize me? Sylvain Chamoux. Oh! What happened? I mean what are you doing here? Domitille is a huge fan of Mee so... Get dressed, you're up in 20 minutes. Because you're... Well if you're up that means you're... See you lat... Let's go? Yes, OK, we're going! Yes, so where is it? - Good evening Mister Bonhomme. - Good evening Miss. I haven't seen the play yet but I've heard magnificent things about you. Thank you. It's very touching. - You are? - Alice Perron. See you soon. - Good evening Alice. - Hi Tim. It's Alice Perron. Yes, it's Alice Perron. Breathe. Yawn. Relax your diaphragm. OK. I'm going to relax. But first I need to tell you something. I don't have sex the first night. I'm not an alcoholic. And I'm fed up with lollipops. I prefer evenings to mornings... Yes, I'm jealous. Look who's here. Finally, I did it. What? I kissed Elvis Presley. Hello. The person who'll sing tonight is little but she is big in my heart. And it's her 30th birthday! It's Vicky. Vicky Banjo. Good evening. I move like a fireball I move, I'm strong Here is the good soldier who's always saying I'm fine I'm a bulldozer My life is a war Laugh if you don't want to fall And succeed to not think I hide in the daytime I get wasted at night When I go to sleep at night I'm just a hurt little girl I wish I could let it go I wish I could fall in love Being taken, being startled being tender I can't live without your cashmere jackets. Let me cry Let me fall I look so good but I'm not perfect Let me cry Let me fall I look so good but I'm not perfect And if I suddenly scream and I stop caring about anything My parents, my friends they only see the coating The good soldier who always says I'm fine But today, I'm exploding I'm changing Goodbye to the unfortunate one Tonight I'm a singer Let me cry Let me fall I look so good but I'm not perfect I'm about to fall. I'm about to cry How sweet it is to be in front of you Bravo my dear. It's my daughter! It's my daughter! Bravo! It's my daughter! Stop it. It's embarrassing for her. Sit down.
