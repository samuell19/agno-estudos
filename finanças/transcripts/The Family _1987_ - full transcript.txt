THE FAMILY How much longer must we wait? This is the day of my baptism, celebrated in the house in the new district in Prati that my grandfather bought. In 20 years it shall be ours. Among those posing are my grandfather in the chair, and I am the infant. Holding me is Adelina, neice of our nanny, Nunzia, that you can see at the back-right. Quiet! - My eyes were crooked! - Of course. I started to laugh! The woman with blue eyes is my mother. Before she got married, she studied singing. Thus I do not sleep with lullabies, but with arias and romantic lyrics. Aunts Millina, Margherita and Luisa are my father's sisters. All three single. That is Dr. Giordani, our family doctor. Single. My grandfather. Professor of Writing at the Univserity of Rome, poetry aficionado and fierce detractor of Carducci, who likes to say: "The lion of the Republic has turned into the poodle of the Queen." What will you be, a genius or an idiot? What nonsense! He'll be a good son of God. Hmm... a modest career. - I want some water! - That would be bad for you! It'll hurt your stomach, you'll get a fever, even Typhoid! The child to whom my grandmother lists the consequences of greed is my uncle Nicolino, my mother's brother. He lives in Macerata, but he's here for the baptism. The child to whom Adelina is trying to feed is my cousin Enrico. He also came for my baptism, though he lives in Rome. He's the son of Uncle Michelle and Aunt Ersilia, who my aunts call, who knows why, "Joan of Arc." Why don't you sing something? - Go on, please! - Okay. Carlo: the name in German is Karl, means "free man". - Remind him of that when he's older. - Yes, father. And finally, my father, Official with the Ministry of Public Education. Come on, Susana is going to sing! But his calling is in the arts. So he spends his free time painting. The "Girl with Fruit," which the doctor is viewing, is one of his works. * The pleasure of love... * * lasts but for a moment... * *The sorrows of love last a lifetime... * * The pleasure of love... * * lasts but a moment... * * The sorrows of love last a lifetime... * * The pleasure of love lasts but a moment... * * The sorrows of love last a lifetime... * - Look out! - I'll stop you! -We'll see! -I'm the guard! -I'm stronger! - Come on! I'm now 10 years old. My brother Giulio is 7 and my cousin Enrico is 12. The infantry cap he's got on is his father's, Uncle Michele, who came home from the front because of a serious family matter. One, two, three... BOOM! I killed you! What are you doing? Hey, what are you doing? - Are you crazy? - Shut up! See if anyone's coming. How much? - Half a lira. - It's too much! It's all there is! Hey, let's split it! - No way! - I saw everything! You can't talk, you're dead! I'm a corpse that can talk and tell everything to Uncle Aristide! - Spy! tattle-tale! - Thief! Thief! - Dummy! - Let's attack Austria! The Austrian infantry are the worst! When they go to war, they shit themselves with fear! Bombs away! Do it again! Bombs away! Do it again! - The Austrian infantry... - Children!! Children... Your grandfather has died. Adelina! For using my face powder! - I didn't use it. - Then it was you! - Me? - You used up all my French powders! - I wouldn't dare touching your powders! - Then it was you! Confess! Quit making things up. Always a drama, just like your sister! - I'm dramatical? - Both of you are! All three of you! I should break this over your head! - Go ahead with your hysterics. - Me hysterical? You old maid! I know very well who's the old maid! We see you flirting with Giordani! Look who's talking! You all melt at the the first man you see, and you dare... you dare... I can't stand it! I'll just kill myself! - No, I'll kill you! - Stop this nonsense! - Goodbye, children, your aunt is leaving. - Stop with the tragedy! This silly old woman says goodbye forever! Don't be an idiot! Open the door! No! I want to die like Tosca! Leave me! Pigs! And Brunello frees himself from the wretched demon and he laughs at his dirty tricks... He sat on a cushion to look taller... But his feet didn't touch the floor! And Mama said: "Sit up, sir!" There's your father. Giulio, come to the table! Put away the magazine, Carlo. Giulio, did you wash your hands? What happened? - Good evening, father. - Hello, Aristide. Today I feel ashamed to be the head of this family. When Dr. Giordani left here the other day, after my father died, he almost ended up in jail. He had to give a thousand explanations to two different policemen, after the train conductor called them, because he couldn't pay the fare. He was robbed! - Here! In this house! - Must've been Adelina. Is there a thief in this family that would steal a lira from the doctor? - Half a lira! Yes, half a lira! Only the thief would know that! What shame! You're a disgrace! It was my fault, too, father. We won't do it again. We'll give the money back and ask forgiveness as we haven't yet spent it. - Carlo, Giulio, how could you? - Giulio... Yes, father? - Giulio... - He's talking to you! And I answered him! Giulio, look... You could at least confess like your brother! - I did! - No. - No! You blurted it out! - Same thing! No, it's not. It has no merit. Carlo is loyal, you're not! You're a thief and a liar! On Sunday afternoon, we won't be going for ice cream in the Esedra Plaza! And you two to bed without supper! Go on! Get going! Poor Dr. Giordani! What a shame! - Arrested by the police! - Like Pinocchio! It's not funny! May I take them a snack later? Yes, but secretly... - Coward! - What did you say? - Coward! - Who's here with you? You... You did it to show them you were better than me! That's how you thank me? I didn't tell you to steal that money, and I was just looking out! No, you told them so I'd look bad! You make me sick! You'll learn! Let go! Let me go! You'll see! Leave me alone! Now you can't get away! - You give up?! - No! Give up! I give up! - The prices were sky-high! - Your fault for always wanting to go to Cotini. It's the best! - What a woman! - My, how fat she is! Why, do you think? From everything... With all the troubles her husband's given her, it's no wonder! Adelina... Here's the saffron. I leave it with you. You can't even go out... they drive like it was a racetrack! Please, in position. These days my father rarely goes out, except once in a while to the ministry. As an inspector, he's not bound by a strict schedule. He spends the afternoons painting the portrait of mother, while she writes long letters to her brother Nicolino. Ma'am the pudding is ready. If you keep on like this, I'll never finish! You don't stop for one second! When I'm not at University, I tutor in literature. De Sanctis is trying to establish a link between literature and civil society. Why do you say "trying to establish"? The link has been established. Are you not familiar with the dialectical concept that postulates that the goal of art is man? Tabanelli says that the goal of art is the good of the nation. Ah, did he? He's quite the old-fashioned sort! Yes. When we enter the room he wants us to greet him in Latin. De Sanctis tries to establish... ...establishes a link... ...between literature and civil society. How's it look? A moustache of authority, like a professor! At least a lecturer! After you graduate, are you going to teach classes? - In Italian and History. - Then we'll be collegues! I hope so! - Good afternoon, ma'am. - That's how you study, eh? Good afternoon. There's some chocolate if you prefer. It's five on the dot! Since I was sick, if I don't have pudding and biscuits, at this time daily, I'll die. - What did you have? - Pleurisy. - Tuberculosis. - Carlo! It's the big terrible family secret! But after 3 years of treatment I was completely cured! Silly boy! Giulio... - What are you doing? - Nothing, she's not worth it. - You're much better!! - Stop it! - Come on, Adelina... - Stop it! - Onion! - Garlic! - No, onion! - I say garlic! Always contradicting me! - Onion! - Garlic! You could use a sedative! - You hear me? - Oh! Matilde's swan! I'm taking you to the madhouse! You hear? To the madhouse! I'm not the only one. A lot of our friends have gone. But to Paris? To work where? I don't know. In whatever, perhaps as a bartender. Yes, a bartender. What're we doing here? The fascists have their goals, but what do we have? We discuss and discover philosophies that show the absurdity of fascism Like... "An individual reignites the power and subdues the masses. The masses, united under one person, make the State. Such is the generation of Leviathan." And we, caught in the sails of this monstrosity, wait for it to die off by itself. If we all go, do you think it'll die off any earlier? Giulio, get the door. And quit smoking! - Good afternoon! - Good afternoon to you! Are you Carlo? For the first time in my life I wish I was! No, I'm his brother. Come, I'll take you. - Good afternoon! - Good... afternoon! - You see how they dress in the street? - That hair and such a small dress! And such small minds! In five minutes I'll see you at the dance. I don't think that with Carlo you'll need more than five minutes. Good afternoon. I'm Adriana, Beatrice's sister. She's in bed with a fever. She sent me with her essay. Sorry to hear that. Thank you. My cousin Enrico. I'm cousin Enrico. Excuse me, I'm going to see what's going on. - Would you like a seat? - Yes... - Please... - I read it on the train. Beatrice has done much better thanks to you. It's as if she copied everything. That is what I tried to teach her. Observation and appropriation. - It's more difficult to observe than invent. - Quite true. That's not mine, it's from Gioachino Rossini. Oh? You think musicians only know about music? Do you study music? In the Conservatory, tenth year. Have you had your snack? It's five o'clock. What else did Beatrice tell you? - Lots. He's serious, strict... - Boring. No... She said you're funny. It's a lie. She also said you're hadsome! But pay no mind, she's just in love with you. With me? She's just a kid! She's only a year younger than I. Ding ding ding! Enough! Class is done! Come dance! Do you mind? What's your name? I'm Giulio, didn't Carlo tell you? Course not, he's jealous of me. - Who is that tramp? - An artist, I suppose. Yeah, we see her "art"... - Why don't you dance? - Why bother asking? He like to play the role of disdain and superiority. Carlo, no matter to us if you won't dance. Same goes to you, Enrico. They're a couple of pessimists! Carlo gives it to Enrico, then they start bothering us. With pleasure! When did he ask foe the dance? - he did it with an Apache signal. - Which? Ah, I see why he's going to Paris! I started writing long letters like my mother. The minute I leave Adriana I run home to write her. For the last three months we've seen eachother daily Beatrice doesn't know. Adriana says it would hurt her too much. "Adriana, my love... ...sometimes I ask myself... ...why we hide our love from Beatrice. Our relationship has more fights and disagreements than happy moments. I know it's me to blame. I'm jealous, pedantic, egostistical... If I lack patience, please have it with me. Miss Beatrice. - Good a fternoon, Carlo. - Hello, Beatrice. The painting of my mother was left unfinished. If she had been more disciplined as a model, perhaps my father would have finished it. Minutes before he died he spoke to me alone, and told me, who knows why: "Carlo, take care of Giulio". "Giulio is weak". I'm sorry. Don't cry, dear. Take off that wet coat. I'm sorry but I have to leave tomorrow. But it would only be for a month. Spring love is beautiful... ...but it can't resist the rain. It's over between us. Please, Carlo, I'm going for my studies! The class taught by Marguerite Long is in Milan and it's important to me! I understand. No. You don't understand! You're the most important thing in the world to me. I only care about the rest so long as I have you. I couldn't stand a month without you! Nor I! I don't think I could stand it. You have to help me. Why would I go? Why should I care about this course? Don't let me go! No. No... I'm going. I have to do it. Will we see eachother tomorrow? No, I'm leaving tomorrow. But why are you going? You said you weren't going! What kind of love is this if we can't be apart for just a month? I don't care if we're apart forever! Adelina! - Please show the lady out! - I know the way! - Wait! Come here! - Leave me alone! - Adriana, wait! - Let me go! - Let me go! - Don't scream! You're a tyrant! I don't want to see you again! - Let's go somewhere else to talk. - I can't talk to you! - Come back inside, Adriana! - No! To think... To think how I deceived my sister all these months! Who cares about her? You're a couple of hysterical maniacs! - Good afternoon, aunties. - Hello, Carletto. Good afternoon, miss. Thank you for coming. Thank you. Good bye, Carlo. "In the Palatine and in the heavens, and all the other beautiful avenues in Mussolini's Rome..." I'm now married and have two children: Paolino and Maddalena. I teach Italian and Latin in the school Liceo Umberto I. But today is Sunday. Hello! Hi Paolino! Up! One, two, up! The plane has no gasoline! The plane's out of gas. Here comes mommy with some morning fuel! - I don't want bread with butter. - Here we go... - For Paolino... - For Paolino... - And for papa... - And for papa, thank you! And this is for Maddalena, the baby of the house! Maddalena that's my car, get out! Papa, later can we go see the ponies? We'll see. Right now you need to take a bath. But look, I'm clean! - You have to bathe every Sunday! - Yeah I know! Otherwise no ponies! if you want to have fun... you have to suffer a little! - Are you coming along? - No, Carlo, I can't. I have to do some more studying. I can't. What are you laughing at? Don't laugh... The telephone! The telephone! Carlo! I'll get it! - No I'll get it! - No, let me! Carlo, the telephone! -We're listening! - It's long distance! - Long distance! - From Paris, it must be Adriana! Hello? Hello? Adriana? Yes operator, this is Rome. Carlo, it's Adriana from Paris. - I heard, mama, I heard. - You're not coming? Yes, we're all fine! Adelina, too! Yes! Yes! - Did you take the test? - Which test? Oh, the one in October? No, no... I'll take it next October. No, I couldn't take it... - Tomorrow I'll be playing in the Salle Pleyel! - In the Salle Pleyel? How wonderful! - It'll be on the radio! - Um, Beatrice... You know who I found here? - The Apache. - What Apache? Oh, yes! Enrico! Carlo! You know who Adriana found? Your cousin Enrico! He married a beautiful girl, Juliette. And they have a precious daughter: Claudine. - Clotilde? - No, no, Claudine! Claudine! - And where's Enrico working? - For an antifascist newsletter. Ah, I understand! He works for a newsletter! He introduced me to some other Italians. There are a lot of political refugees here. - Some are going to Spain. - Ah, I hear you, very good! Ask her if Paris is as beautiful as they say! And the Seine? And the boulevards? It's a marvellous city! So free! You can say and think whatever you like! Even in public! Seems she's taken up politics! The door! The people out in the streets, thanks to the new governemnt full of happiness! And Italy? How are things there? No, we better hang up! - It's going to cost you a fortune! - Miss Susanna! Your brother! Nicolino! Ok, bye then... When are you coming to Rome? Papa, look it's uncle Nicola! What handsome kids! Give me a kiss! Hello, Susanna! - How are you? - Nicolino,what are you doing here? It was terrible! - Hello, uncle! - Carlo, how are you? But what's this? Still in pyjamas? Are you sick? Hello, Luisa. What a nice uniform, makes you look thinner! - How handsome! What a day! 800 municipal secretaries together in the Mussolini Forum! First we marched for a couple of hours, then three hours on foot waiting, that's five hours in the sun! And finally he came! He himself! In person! What's he like? What's he like up close? He always in a rush! And really satisfied with himself! And even though I was tired, I have to admit I felt satisfied too! Everyone was satisifed! Well yes, everyone was quite satisfied! - Nobody doubts that, Nicola. Go on. - Very well. He was passing nearby. He stopped in front of me... He looked me in the eyes and asked: "Municipal Secretary of...?" I was flustered and said: "Wherever you'd like me, sir!" - What a shame! - You can say that again! Pretty soon Macerata will have a new Municipal Secretary! Go ahead, laugh! They advised me to talk to my superiors otherwise I'll be out on the street! Yeah, like Carlo! Stop it! It's the truth! I told you to cut it out! - What happened with Carlo? - Would you like some more meatballs? - Adelina! - Well what happened? Nothing yet. But this month he has to decide! He won't understand that affiliating himself won't mean anything! You're a piece of work! To defend your ideas, you say they aren't ideas. And on that I agree. They aren't ideas. How funny! So if it doesn't mean anything, why should I do it? - Because it's compulsory! - You see? - Yes! - So it must mean something! Carlo, eat! So in order to work, I have to lower myself like him? - How have I lowered myself? - He doesn't mean you, eat! Pardon me, I didn't mean you. - If everyone were like you... - Then fascism would be a circus! You don't think it is already? Please, a little respect! - It's not about you, Nicola. - Of course it is! Well what do I care? It's your familiy, do what you want! Excatly, Giulio, you said it! Carlo can do what he likes. And you agree with him? Me? I'm satisfied! - I won't come back to this house! - Promises, promises! Laugh, go ahead and laugh! Paolino, I'll show you a game! What game? Paolino, come and play! Come here! - Where are you? - Here! - Paolino! - I'm right here! - Are you in here? - I'm right here uncle! - He's not behind the curtain! - Here I am! Margherita, have you seen him? - I'm right here, auntie! - Has anyone seen Paolino? I can't find him! - Giulio... Help me find Paolino! - I'm right here! - Have you seen Paolino? - I'm right here! - Where are you!? - Here!! Paolino, come on! I'm here!! Paolino! Are you under here? No. - In here? - I'm right here! Where are you? I'm right here, don't you see me? Paolino, come and play! Mama! Paolino! Paolino... He's not there! Paulino, what's the matter? - What's the matter? - Don't cry... Paolino, come to mama... - What were you doing? - Nothing! We played the same game when you were little, remember? No, I don't, and it's a stupid game! Like always, it's my fault. Come here to dad. Take it easy, calm down! Calm down, Paolino! Paolino! *I like the things...* *...that are made sweetly...* *... and that speak of love...* Bitter old spinsters! Look at how fat you are! You're like a cow! Me, like a cow!?! I haven't eaten all day! I can't stand it! I'll just kill myself! - No, I'll kill you! - Open up! Move! Leave me alone! Let's see... Turn around. Hey now! Keep your hands to yourself! Let go, Giulio! Stop! You're going to wrinkle the shirt! Please, stop! You think I don't suffer without you? Well don't suffer when I'm here! Giulio, Giulio... - You're going to Africa? - It's a military secret. - Yes, I'm going, I'll write! - Yes, make sure you do! With all those Moors there! There! There! That's Adriana. Italy should have, and will have, a fundamental law! The Constitutional Assembly... My cousin Enrico died in Spain in '37. Since '43 Adelina is no longer our servant. She works with her brothers who make a good living in the black market. Papa... Last week Giulio returned home from India, where he was imprisoned for more than two years. Subject, verb, very good! I got back my teaching job at Liceo, and I'm the associate professor under the head, Professor Sapegno. But with what I earn I still can't afford to let Beatrice buy real coffee. - Last night I dreamt you died. - Did it make you sad? - No. - Why not? When you dream someone dies, it lengthens their life. Ah, that's good then! - Good morning, ma'am. - Good morning. Good morning! - And here I am. - Hello, mom. Two hours in line for half a pound of potatoes. Giulio, wake up. It's one o'clock! Your chicory! - You drink it. - I already did. Why must we both suffer? You're not the only one who went to war! Nor the only prisoner! Salgari. It's great! You can't go on like this. If I'm a nuisance... Why do you act like a clown?! To surprise you a little. Giulio... Are you going to eat at the table today? Adriana is coming. With her beau. "Take the rose and cry". What's that from? Silvio Pellico. In "My Prisons". - Hello, father! - Hello, Paolino! Good morning, uncle! Look what I found for you at the library! "The Adventures of a Boy in Paris"!! by Louis Boussenard! How wonderful! - Dammit, wow, oh my! - Oh my, wow, dammit! The Sonzogno Edition! With the original illustrations! Dammit! Wow! Oh, my! - How are you? - When I'm better... I feel worse. Chapter 1: "The Devourer of Men". How wonderful, Adelina. - You look great! - You, too! - You, too, professor! - You needn't call me that. - You too, Carlo. - We grew up together! Did you see what Adelina brought? Meat, oil, flour, butter, sugar... I told her we'd pay her at the end of the month. - Please, don't worry. - Of course I do! Where's the fruit bowl? For the oranges... - It should be there somewhere. - It's not, mama, you know that! We sold it along with all those other things, including the piano! After we rented out half the floor, everything didn't fit... To some well-educated people! Their house in the south was bombed so they came to Rome. They're not that well-educated! - What have they done? - Nothing, she likes nobody! Me? Slanderers! - What have they done? - They never greet me! - Not to you, you witch! - Yes! Me a witch? I'm the only lady here! And hysterical! - You old bat! - I don't know why I put up with you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! - Why do I put up with it? - Hysterical! No! Not Uncle Nicola's figurine! I'll kill you! You see, Adelina? Nothing has changed! Adelina, aren't you going to say hello to Giulio? Giulio? He's back? May I go say hello? Always such a sweet girl! Mama, what's wrong? Beatrice, what happened? Beatrice... - Why are you crying? - I don't know! Maybe it's because we're seeing Adriana after all these years. Or perhaps because taking all this is another expense. Don't worry. Or because I have no idea how to cook this... It's a rabbit. - A rabbit? - Yes. Yeah, it's a rabbit. Despite the social and political differences that divide us, I believe that in Italy today there is a euforia, a tension, a stimulation! A superficial... ...Thank you! A superficial observer would only see a grand confusion and not the desire of the people to discuss and to debate! Within the parties, in the press, between ex-enemies, after the silence that came upon it with fascism. Don't you think? - Carlo. - Yes, Beatrice? - The architect was talking to you. - Yes, I heard him! - Go on, continue! - Well... I was saying that Italians are in a difficult moment, - but very stimulating! - Yes, for you! I don't know why the French seem to think that Italy's problems seem so stimulating! No, I meant the exact opposite! Well you know that we are living in a very difficult time! But also very fertile, constructive, rich in moral uprisings! - That's exactly what I... - Jean-Luc, leave it. Leave it? How can I leave it? -I should explain... - I understood! Yes, in Italy we also know languages! "We understand everything!" Like I was trying to say, yes, our history is now stained with serious bloodshed We've seen our brothers bleed and die! Even some went a little crazy, for sure! But that's exactly the cost for society and the nation to change! That's exactly what I had said! We Italians are learning to confront our ideas. And we have many! Sometimes too many! A ton of them! - Carlo, listen... - What?!? It seems you both are saying the same thing! Please don't interupt, my dear! Excuse me, but I also think we're saying the same thing in general. If you'll allow me to say so! and even though you speak of euphoria and happiness, I don't think you're very happy. In reality I think you're a bit upset, discontent, and quite irritated! And the way you talk about this new course of history makes me think you're not very happy with it! - Me?!? - You see what kind of impression you're making? What kind of impression am I making? - Like I'm a fascist? - No. A reactionary? Well I'll have you know that the party I am affiliated with the Action Party, to be exact, that of Ferruccio Parri, I don't know if... - Yes. It's the party that has contributed most to the social changes that you speak of without knowing anything about anything! A party that has given lectures on rigor and combat including to the French! - To us, the French? - Yes, a voux! You! And I'd better not get more specific. - To be honest, I'm having trouble following you... - Even better! But if it's like that, then I have to assume your mood is for personal reasons, not national ones. Plus, we all know that intellectuals are chronic discontents, aren't they? Look, I'm very content! Very content! The most content! Yes, somewhat less when someone tries to tell me that he's saying the same as I, when it's completely different! - Above all, from the French! - Again? Look, things aren't like before! Everything depends on the criteria, the intention of he who announces the concept Yes, it all depends on who it is that is proposing it! Depends on his intention! Of course, you have to know the what, how, when and where! Imagine if right now I told you, for example... If I told you that... Of course it's just an example! Understand? Answer the question! Answer! So you and Jean-Luc went to La Scala yesterday? Yes, it was fabulous! Toscanini is unforgettable! I can imagine! So now we change the subject to alleviate the tension I've made? But what will they think? What will these foreigners think?!? Tell me! What kind of impression do we give you? At least we'll know if we're thinking the same thing! He's an imbecile! This nervousness is perhaps part of the euphoria and tension that we spoke of earlier. Don't get upset, please... - Excuse him, architect. - Excuse me? - Forgive us, Adriana. - Why are you asking for forgiveness? Excuse us from what? Don't you realize you called the architect an imbecile? Why did you mention it? He hadn't noticed! And you excuse me? You're being a coward, haven't you noticed? - And you like an ignorant moron! - Yes, right!! What's wrong with you? He called me an imbecile and I didn't notice. Maybe he's right after all. I'm sorry, Beatrice. I'm sorry. Carlo... I'm sorry. - I don't think I'll marry him. - Why not? He's nice, loving... He loves you. But I can't love anyone. * Casta diva... * * Casta diva che inargenti... * Papa didn't know how to paint and you don't know how to sing. A family of artists! Giulio and Adelina married in '48. They live on Emanuele Filiberto Street, and have adopted a girl: Marina. Paolino has graduated. He argues about everything, proves himself right, then changes his position. He wants to continue his studies. Maddalena, we're going to the beach, not a beauty pageant! Two cases from grandma! One case for grandma Mama! - Are your things ready? - Yes, they're ready! Finally! - I'll take these two. - Yes Two bags for mother ready to load!! - Why are you leaving so late, ma'am? - And hurry up with those! - We're ready. - Do you need anything else? You can check that all the windows are closed. - Very well. - Okay. - How calm they are! - Yes. Ever since Aunt Millina died, they're not seen nor heard. Poor things... You're still here? Would you hurry up? Her beautiful form lost its clothes! Cut it out! Paolino, bring me Giulio's manuscript that's on my desk! Carlo, how it this possible? You still haven't had time to read it? Giulo, I told you, I've had exams until yesterday, how could I? But take it easy I'll take it with me to the beach and read it there, ok? - Here you are, papa. - Ah, thanks. I want to read it too, uncle! - It's taken me two years to write it! - That's true! I've edited it and condensed it but it might still be too long, you tell me what you think. It's really good! Authentic and moving! "The Squanderer". Good title! Blunt! Yes, Carlo. - It's the adventure of my life! - It's fabulous! Yeah, you said that, thanks my dear! Well I hope you'll visit us in August! If we have time. We have to start our enterprise. We've found some great places to put in laundromats! Nice big places, in Merulana Street! - In an area with a lot of people! - Ah, very good! -Then we'll open another in the Plaza Zama. - A chain! - The future is in laudromats! - Yes, but Giulio... - Coming! - A writer or laundryman? - Why not pick one? - Coming through! Like Dante! - He was a dry cleaner. - No, a goldsmith. - Medicine and botany, dummies! - You're right! - Very good! - Thank you. - How about get dressed, Carlo? - What shall I put on? - Mama... - Giulio, would you help with mother? Mama, you there? Come on, let's go! Mama... We're here! Miss Susanna. Why do you have on a coat? It's cold in the Terminillo. We went there for Christmas, but we're going to the beach! - Must I go? - I think so. - Will you take her? - Sure. - I'll take the bags. - Yes, good. - Marina, you coming? - Come, Marina. Grandma in the 1400 and the aunties in the sedan! - Maddalena, did you shut off the gas? - Yes, mother! Father! Father! I brought the chess set and scrabble and also the cards, so we can play together at night. - You little rascal! - Daddy! The lights! Bon voyage, professor! - Thank you, Anna. - See you, Anna! Water the plants and send us the mail. Paolino will give you the keys for my sister. - No problem. - See you soon! Dear Beatrice, thank you for the invitation. I went to your house but I couldn't stop to see you in Santa Marinella, As I'll only be in Rome for a day, for my RAI audition. Then I'll go to Genova, Marsella, and then I'll return to Paris. Come! Let's go! "Welcome, sister!" Hello, Adriana. Adriana, it's me! What a shock! I'm s o sorry! Excuse me. Only you... How are you? I didn't know you were in Rome. And you, how are you? Well, I'm well! And from what I see, you're well too! I'll go find a broom. Careful with the glass. I came... to see some students that are preparing for graduation. Thank you. In nine hours, the other boats rescued two thousand people. It's three o'clock: The Coast Guard has reported "It's sinking rapidly. The 'Andrea Doria', as tall as a fort, as large as a city, is dying in a grave of only 70 meters". 4,000 united in Rome for the national assembly of the Christian Democratic party. Quite controversially against extremism, the opening speech of Fanfani, The party's secretary stated: "We do not participate in anything that compromises a democratic Italy". The most controversial writer from the US has married the most desired woman in the world. Without make-up nor provocative clothing, and arriving from the Hollywood studios, Marilyn takes refuge in the arms of Arthur Miller. A new marriage, a new life. Hello! I think a mosquito bit me! Yes... We'll not be spared this year. A storm is coming. Have you seen the lightning? Hey... Oh, there he is! You know what I haven't forgotten in all these years? That slap I gave you. Which one? I had forgotten about that. Because you forgave me. But I haven't forgiven myself. If you want, I'll give you a slap and we can call it even! Yes, please slap me. - I'll go call a taxi. - I'll come with you. - No. - Yes, I want to! I told you no! Help me. Help me, Adriana. How can I help you? Will you come live with me in Paris? Would you like to? We can start a new life together. Or shall I come to Rome, and be your secret lover? And once in a while I could come visit my sister. What do you want? Uh, yes! Yes, a taxi please, to 45 Scipione Emiliano Street. Thank you. Adriana, you... Listen... In all these years, When I wasn't thinking of you, and you didn't think of me, we've had happy moments. Let's think about them. It will be easier for you than it will for me. I'm alone. You have the university, your books, your politics. - And most of all - them. - Yes, but you... - you won't be there, you'll leave again! - Let me go! You're running away! You always do! - and there won't be another chance! - Let me go, Carlo. I beg you, Adriana, last time you also went with a thunderstorm. Please don't go! Please, don't leave me! - Adriana, please! - No! I'm sorry. Paolino! Carlo! Finally a little peace! What a disaster it's been! Ever since you left, It's been one thing after another! - Why is that? - You haven't had a good time? - Yeah, right! With those five? Maddalena, mother, grandma, aunt Margherita and aunt Luisa. And six with that crazy Armando! Of course... you too... in Rome... with aunt Adriana, always a bit crazy. Right, father? I mean aunt Adriana is always a little crazy. Yes, a little crazy! Did you go to that meeting with the Socialists? Yes, and I argued with everyone. You always argue with those that think the same as you. You should probably get together with those that disagree with you. Dialectic insatisfaction! - Somebody's been touching my things! - Hey, who is Armando? My zeppelin is missing! Who is Armando? Maddalena's fiance. Engaged? Why engaged? Why do people get engaged? To get married, right? Easy, take it easy! Don't be stupid! Why rush into "I promise to marry... "? Slow down! First you have to graduate, right? You know, you have to help me at the university, and then you'll have a salary and be independant! Then you can look at marriage in another way. - We want to get married soon! - Like how soon? The sooner the better, immediately! But with whom? Who is this Armando?!? - He's full of ideas, full of passion! - Yes... He puts himself at risk to change society! Ah, then everything's great! He's the man we've been waiting for! Did you notice that you just wrote a fairy tale? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say that. I don't even know him. But you too have to think about it, Maddalena. If you go... - You know I think you're the jewel of the family! - Father! You're the smartest in the family, that's why I need you. Itelligence needs company, because alone, it drowns itself. I can talk to you, Maddalena! And you with me, right? Father, you're so egotistical! Mother, what are you doing? - I'm throwing away all of this. - No way! - Please... - I don't understand you! Tell me, what do you want with these things? - Everything here has its purpose! - This too? Mother... A: I love you. B: I love being just like you! And how are you like me? We're the dumbest ones in the family! But you gotta have dummies in the family too, no? Why do you say that? If it was father? Your father? The smartest or dumbest? This is the question, mother. First you get things straight then you get married! He's smart, vibrant, he's got qualities! - He's crazy! - Don't say that! - I'll marry him! - No! No! - What a snow! - Damn it! Look at Paolino! What's he doing at this time? - Paolino! - Hi, ma! - What are you doing? Can't you see how it's snowing? - Look out, it's war! Close it, Beatrice! What a son you have! When did it snow last? In '51? No, in 1950. Oh, you have a hot water bottle and I don't? I asked you if you wanted one but you didn't want to admit it in front of everyone! Lend it to me a moment! Don't touch me with your cold feet! What are you thinking about? At my age one doesn't think. One only remembers. You talk like an old man! - Are they good memories? - No, they're the worst. They make you say: "We were better before". Something we should never say. No, the best memories are the bad ones. Always to the contrary, my professor! - I got it! I got it! - Got what? A thought. Tell me. I love you. - It's not a memory? - Dummy! It's about time it snowed! You said the last time was in 1950. Give me back the bottle. Another thought! What a productive evening! Go on! Well... Maybe Beatrice deserved something better. Maddalena! Armando! He loves the snow. Don't you? Yes. It depends. - Maddalena. - What? You think your father approves of me? Yes. I think so. Violeta to Alfredo: "The sum of life's pleasures!". Alfredo to Violeta: "While still unloved, unloving?". Violeta to Alfredo: "Experience ne'er has taught me". Alfredo to Violeta: "And thus my fate must be". Chorus: "Let's enjoy the drink and song. The night is beautiful and smiles, and in this paradise discovers the new day". They hear music in the other room. What is that? Violeta: "Shall we dance?" Chorus: "What a grand idea!" "We accept!" Violeta: "Then let's go!" But Violeta feels weak all of a sudden. What is happening? Over the Castle Verona the afternoon sun shines. From the Chiusa one can only hear the lonely cry of a steer. - Hello, father. - Hello, Carletto. Hello, mother. - Murmuring in the sully... - Sunny! ...in the sunny green lands by the river, and King Theodore... Old, sad King Theodore is bathing there. I'm no longer giving concerts, I'm teaching. Those that know, know, and those that don't, teach. Like you, professor. I didn't write sooner because I was in the hospital to have the operation I've been putting off. Nothing serious, but it worried me. Even so, I still suffer from it. I haven't said anything about it to Beatrice, to not worry her. I'm going around in circles because I'm afraid to tell you... No, I'll tell you! I'm getting married, Carlo. Can you believe it? At my age? Reminds me of a quote from Chekov: "If you are afraid of loneliness, do not marry". He must have written it when he was young. My fiance is named Victor, but he's Italian. A fashion designer. He's a few years older than me and he's a great friend. Shall we return, Your Majesty? They await us at home. - Grandpa! - What? Will Theodore of Verona go to the house where they await him? Read, Carletto. Read the poem to the end and you'll find out! But why am I reading it if you're not listening? No, I was listening. Grandpa... Is it true that your grandfather always argued with Carducci? - Who told you that? - Uncle Paolino. Who won the argument? I don't know. But now you're reading Carducci's poems and not my grandfather's. What a terrible beast, It is surely the least! Only the Virgin Mary knows when I shall return. Don't ask me to read you a poem ever again! Please, mother... Women can't have a career too? You know what they call women who gain success with a bed? - Tarts? - Whores. Hey, hey! What language! Beatrice, if our daughter has made a desicion, let her make it! Love is like a cough, you can't hide it. I guess Armando is still coughing and she's gotten over it. But she wants to leave with another! Leave a son, destroy a family, and you joke? The family should start with ourselves. One shouldn't give up one's own happiness. - Right? - Yes, father, you're right. - I'm proud of you! - You see? We're happy to have Carletto stay a while longer with us. I'll never forget you and your wife. Are you taking this radio? No, leave it. You taking this? No, it was my sister's. This shirt is yours. And the record player? - They gave it to you. - But you use it. Take it. I don't want it, thanks. This is yours. And this, yours. Here. Carletto, what are you doing? Come watch the TV, Zurli the Magician is on! Today Carletto is 7 years old. Enrico's widow Juliette has come from Rome with her daughters Claudine and the little Juliette the second. She's precious. Carletto likes her a lot. Stop it! Don't cry, Juliette. It's nothing, take it easy. Listen. You know you're the second Juliettte and I'm the second Carlo? Silence! This is a serious game, so be serious! All right!? Right, each one has to say, very clearly: "I am... " and read what's on the slip. Carletto, give me your hat. Blue slips for the boys, and pink ones for the girls. We'll start with... with Juliette. Take a slip and say: "I am... " then read the pink slip. - What about the presents? - Later, the presents later. Great prizes! - I am a witch. - Of course, with that face! Just like a witch! You're next. Say: "I am... " - I am... - Very good! This is our wedding gift for Adriana. - You like it, Juliette? - How marvellous! - And you, Claudine? - Very pretty! Pretty, eh? Did you see it, Marina? - Claudine, you remember Adriana? - Yes. She was the one who phoned me when you were born. I hadn't heard your name right. I asked her "Her name is Clotilde?" And she said: "No, Claudine!". - And Auntie Margherita? - She doesn't live here anymore. She's in a convent. Ever since Luisa died she hasn't stopped praying aloud. I saw you last week. - Yeah? - At the Ariston Theatre. Oh, yes. - Was that him? - Yes. I thought you didn't like westerns. Tastes change. - I am an astronaut! - Last ones! Who hasn't gone? - You. - I am a great singer. Good. And you, Marina? What? Who are you or what do you want to be? Marina, answer him! And you, uncle? Who are you? Or what did you want to be? Me? I'm not in the game. You always say the same thing, but it's your game. Very good, Marina. Ok, children! Let's go open the presents! No, it's better you don't tell her. Good bye. What do we have here? Me too! Adelina... Is Giulio okay? He looks worried. He's got a lot of problems. The candy business is tough. Do you have a store? Not any more, thank God! It failed. Now Giulio works in wholesale. But he's got little inventory. What he's got mostly are debts. He's so wonderful and sensible. I called to tell you... How's the family? You wife and everyone else are well? Yes? Happy to hear that. And your children? Don't cry, dear. Don't cry... The bill that's due the day after tomorrow... Hello, children. They're my neices. I can't pay that bill. He's always on the phone. [Speaks in Hungarian.] Look how well you can see your house from here! There's the window to dining room, the living room, and the balcony. I've seen you many times. And I've seen you. - Look, there's Boganc. - "Boganc"? Boganc! Boganc! Boganc! How beautiful! He's a precious dog. A dog and three kids, that's all my husband left me. What a bastard! - Italian? - Hungarian. Just as well. What do you do? I work in the Alessandrina Library, and every so often, I do other things. You've got a lot of freckles! Tons! I like them! How do you say "freckle" in Hungarian? "Szepl?ss?." "Szepl?ss?." "Szepl?ss?!" "Szepl?ss?!" That's prettier than "freckles." If you could divide the interest, then next month I can pay the first part of the interest. Yes, yes! - And 25 percent of the first bill. - I'll get it, Adelina. That should be acceptable, no? - Uncle Nicola, what a surprise! - A disaster. The trains and buses all on strike. Can't even find a taxi! Come in! - How are you? - Fine, and you? - You look good! - I'm getting by. You know Carletto is turning seven today! - I didn't bring him anything. What a crowd! - No, don't worry about it! - Carlo! - Good afternoon. Look who's here! - Uncle Nicola! - How are you, Carlo? Giulio! Why have you locked yourself in there? They could have warned me that he was coming! That bloodsucker Nicola! They probably didn't know. You know he stops by every so often. Giulio, open up! Don't say my name! Leave me alone! Everyone leave me alone! I want to die! I want to die! Don't say that. I want to die! Giulio, open the door! Don't get like that. Listen... Go over there, pull him aside and tell him calmly. All right? If you explain it he will understand. It can happen to anyone in tough times. All right? Let's go. There we are. I'm coming. - How do I look? - You look fine. Let's go. Come on. I missed the bus so I walked. But I ended up in San Giovanni. I asked someone where Prati was... He said: "It's close, just follow the Muro Torto and you'll soon be there". - Two and a half hours walking. - Uncle Nicola. - Yes? - I don't have the five million. Hello, how are you? I didn't know you were here! Now you know. I repeat, you won't see a single lira. Do you know how much I earned last month? 25,000 liras. And that only because I sold my Mickey Mouse collection. You think this is the right time for this? Leave it... - How am I going to pay him? - We'll sort it out. What is there to sort out? I owe you a fortune too! What's happening, Giulio? Are you joking? - I hadn't said anything! - No joke! - I don't have the five million! - But I wasn't asking for it! I don't have it! - I don't have it and I don't have it! - Giulio... Take it easy, calm down. Don't obsess over it. But you, Mr. Nicola... you always upset Giulio. Happy Birthday to you! Happy Birthday to you! Happy birthday, Carletto, Happy Birthday to you! OK, Carletto, now make a wish and blow out the candles! Bravo, father, well done! Blow them out in one blow and make a wish! Go on, blow them out! Bravo! Well done! - "What a shame!", Aunt Luisa would say. - Aunt Margherita... It made me want to laugh and cry at the same time. Giulio has upset me many times. My father was right. Perhaps it was also my fault. I knew you'd say that. But why? Well... Because I've critisized him. Or I felt sorry for him. One expects more from a brother. Don't smoke, it's so bad for you! You know... in the main lecture hall at the university behind the cathedral, the students have written: "The professor is a jerk". And I give classes under that... The best part of parties is when we are alone talking. - What were we talking about? - About us. Perhaps we don't give enough attention to Paolino. The children... The children that don't make trouble get less attention. This house has never felt so large. Adelina took care of the funeral. Always so friendly and helpful. After their wholesale business went broke, she and Giulio opened a herbal shop. I've been retired for two years. - Grandfather, I'm going. - OK, have a good trip, Carletto. - I'm taking this. - Let's see. Good bye, auntie. When I come back, I'll tell you if I liked it. Fine, take it. - Bye. - Bye, Carletto. Bye. - Where's he going? - I don't know. He comes and goes. The youth of today don't settle for what we wanted before, they try to come up with new dreams. They still don't know what they want. That's the first time I've heard you use a clich?. Age is unforgiving. Clich?s always have a grain of truth. And another! I see... that to please you I should only speak in paradoxes. I'll be amused in no time. - Every season has its fruit. - And that makes three! Now all you have to say is that one has only one mother, and that blacks have rhythm in their blood and you'll have them all. OK, you're right. Very well. So the youth are right. They're more sincere than their elders. And they'll change this society that their parents have made so disgusting. - Is that better? It's not a clich?? - Yes, but at least it's a fresher one. Enough! I've spent 50 years arguing with you! I'm fed up with it! Besides it makes me older. When did you know? I had my doubts... - But I spoke to Beatrice and she told me. - When? In December. When she came to see me after Victor broke his femur. Couldn't you have told me then? - You've always known it. - Me? I knew that Beatrice knew about us? Are you crazy? Yes... You knew it. You sensed it. For 50 years Beatrice kept silent so she wouldn't lose you. We all said nothing. What a shame. What stupidity! What are you you saying? What do you mean? If it's true, if she kept silent it was because... she knew I had married the right woman. She knew that with you, I would be unhappy. We both would be unhappy! We would have split up and gotten back together a hundred times, we would hate eachother. That's what would have happened, a hellish life! Without Beatrice, our home and our family would not have existed. You should have told her that. - I'm leaving. - Go ahead, leave like always! And you stay, like always. It is evil that makes people leave. Go on, everyone leave, it's for the best. High blood pressure is bad. Of course I'm leaving! I don't want to risk catching it. Call me a taxi, if you remember how it's done. No, I don't remember, call him yourself. Hello? A taxi to 45 Scipione Emiliano, please. Yes. Thank you. Good bye. Good bye. - Good morning, ma'am. - See you later, Anna. Is the professor eating well? He looks a little thin. He usually eats well, he hasn't wanted anything today. - Take care of him. - Don't worry. - Hello, pop! - Hello, Paolino! - You need anything? - No, no. You want to have dinner with us? Marika made canelones. She puts marmelade and paprika on them, but they're good. - So, dad? - No, no thanks. I have some soup from yesterday and I'll make a couple of eggs. - Thanks, Marika. - Well come by after you eat. "Bont? loro" is on tonight. - OK, maybe after I eat. - OK. See you! - We'll be waiting for you! - Thanks, Marika. Come on in. - Thank you, ma'am. - Bye, Carlito. - Hello, grandfather! - Hey, Carletto! - How's it going? - Fine. - You're looking well! Even a tie! - Yes. You did that? Yes. A copy. It's nice! Delicious! - Will you get that, Carletto? - Yes, yes. Thank you. Hello Uncle Paolino! - Dear Carletto, how are you? - Fine, and you? Great. - [Speaks in Hungarian] - Yes, yes. - Hello, Auntie Marika. - Good afternoon. - Hello, little ones! - Hello Uncle Carlito! - Hello, Fruska! - Hello! - Hello, how are you? - Fine, thanks. - Hello, Herman! - Hello. -Hello, uncle Guilio! - Little one! - How are you? - Fine... And you? Fine! - Auntie Adelina! How's it going? - Fine, and you Carletto? - Fine! - Don't close the door, there's Marina. - Aunt Marina! - Hola! - How are you? - Very well. - And you, what's your name? - Marina. - Marina! - Hello Mother! - Hello sweetie! -Hello, Carletto! - Good afternoon! - How are you? - Fine, and you? - Hey there, brother! - What are you doing? - What am I doing? Nothing! Go on, take this to the closet. Wow, what a place! Good afternoon! Good afternoon! - Dad? - Hi, Carletto! -How are you? - Fine. - Hello, Carletto! - Good afternoon! - Hello, Carletto! - Hello! - Hello, Carletto! - Hello! Hello Carletto! How are you? We meet at last! - Hello! - Hello Carletto! - Hello... Loridana! - Hello Carletto! - Hello! Come on in! - Hello, How are you? - Fine, thanks. - Hello, Carletto. - Hello, Carletto. - Hello, Auntie! - Carletto! - Madame Juliette! - Carletto! - How are you? - Very well. - Madame Claudine! - Hello, Carlito! - Hello, Carletto! - Hello! Carlo, I have to confess something to you. Oh? Go ahead! And I also have something for you. Oh, then you go first! - No, no, you! - No, you're older, go on! Fine. You remember when you had me read that manuscript in... what year was that? 1956 or 1957? Oh yes, "The Squanderer"! The intimate tale of a failure! - Yes. - What about it? Well I told you then that I read it and found it to be empty, inconsistent, and full of grammatical errors. Yes, you've always given it to me straight. However, I never read it. I based it all on my personal knowledge of the author. A lie! I have a liar brother and didn't know it. A huge hit! The myth has been debunked! Don't exagerrate, Guilio! Deep inside you've always despised me! Yes, that's true. Very well, a few days ago I found the manuscript. It was in a bookcase in our bedroom. So, I've read it, and... It's fantastic! Fantastic? Really? Marvellous! Yes, it's a work of great sensibility! A great dedication! Yes, Guilio, I've been defrauding you for nearly 70 years! Ah, and this is how you tell me? How should I say it? But, Carlo, let's speak frankly, you are... the one guilty of denying a country from reading a magnificent writer? Let's not get carried away, let's not exagerrate! - Don't exhalt yourself! - You said it! 10,000 copies... Valued at approximately 10 thousand liras... Ten percent for the author... 10,000 copies by a thousand liras per copy is ten million... Carlo... You've totally screwed up my life, damn you! You see that? I was right. You're overambitious! Yes, a bit. And you? What was it that you wanted to confess? Nothing. You remember when we were kids, I always told you "I have something to confess" so that you'd say "Me, too!" You... always had something to confess to me And I never did! What are you trying to say? That I was a hypocrite and you were always sincere? Well... yes. Or perhaps not. Take it easy. You're fine like that. Don't trouble yourself. You came, too? Yes, Carletto insisted so much. If he hadn't insisted you wouldn't have come. Hey, I can still leave, you know! How many people are here? A lot! They're all here. It's a big family, I don't know even half of them! Yeah, go figure! Am I handsome? You're the type of man that... when young isn't so great, but... when he ages... gets worse! Get out of here, they're calling you! Hmm, I hadn't heard them. Because you're deaf! I'll go so you can get ready in peace. Wow, look at them all! - Hello! - Hello! How is everyone? Everyone okay? Carlo... You've never grown a moustache, eh? - No. - Why? You think I'd look good with a moustache? Yes, of course! And thus I have arrived at 80 years old. It's a lot, it's a little, it could be the most harmonious age. And who is this handsome young man? It's your great-grandson! My great-grandson! Now? Move over there, uncle, to give grandpa more light. Juliette? Ah, perfect! Carletto has turned into Casanova! Ready? Well, here we are! Here we are!
