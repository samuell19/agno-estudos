I can see you're getting the word out. In two days. With a the link to the website. You got it. How about you? You going soon? Yeah. Everything ready your side? I'm good. I gotta go. See you soon. You're done? She's finished. Looks great. You know, the promo I posted to the website yesterday? Four million hits already. I haven't even seen it yet. Hi, I'm Sophie. Follow me to Kronos. We should celebrate. Isn't it a little early to celebrate? Passport. - Have a nice flight. - Thank you. Patel? Yeah, that's me. Little Abraham. Mmm-hmm? You coming? Where's Jake? Waiting. It's a big decision. Once I commit, there's no going back. He's on the list. Alain, so nice to see you. Good to see you again, Priscila. Welcome to my home. Jean and Ning Tang are already inside. Come and join us. You have a beautiful home. Oh, it was once owned by an original Montreal robber baron. A bootlegger? Oh. After 9/11 I installed a panic room. This way. - Good to see you again, Jean. - Hello. - Ning Tang. - Hello, Mr. Jarnac. Want to take a seat? - Anything else, Madame? - No, thank you. Please close the door on your way out. I want to thank you all for making time for me. Yeah. But why are we here? Mr. Jarnac's servers at Vialette in Europe as well as his personal computers have all been hacked last week. And you're only telling us about this now? Ms. Tang, what is your role exactly in all of this? I'm an associate of Mr. Jarnac's. Under the circumstances, We didn't think it prudent to contact you through phone or email. I've been hacked as well. The ministerial office in Ottawa, my home. My mobile, my email. Everything. Jesus! Any idea who it is? We have our people looking into it. I've got my suspicions, but nothing I can confirm yet. Be careful. Don't talk about anything we've been involved with on any digital platform. Cell phones. Nobody move. Meet my bodyguard. All of you on the ground. Now! What did they do to us? This is what we know so far. Four hostages. Two businessmen, the Canadian Minister of the environment, and a Chinese businesswoman. Alain Jarnac, CEO of the $64 billion Vialette Corporation. It's a multinational company that sells processed foods, beverages and desserts. Jean Dubois, CEO of Cadara Oil. Also involved in the construction of pipelines and refineries. Priscila Spencer-Kraft is an ex-journalist, on-air personality, Canadian Minister of the Environment. And Ning Tang, CEO of something called JPPC Investments. What are their demands? The kidnappers have yet to make direct contact. Are they terrorists? - Not sure. - You said they haven't made direct contact. Well, this is a teaser commercial for the new Kronos videogame. It's been hijacked by the kidnappers and it redirects to... Well, just watch this. Kronos is a state of mind. But this is going to become very real. Follow me to justice. Let the trials begin. So, by hijacking Kronos, they have immediate access to millions of viewers. Not to mention it's on Facebook, Twitter, and all the social media. What do they mean trials? What trials? Where does the signal come from? As far as we can tell, from Spencer-Kraft's panic room. Well, then, why don't we just go in? You mean breach the panic room? Is that possible? Yeah, it's possible, but, probably ill advised at this point. We don't know what they want, what they're capable of. Until they make direct contact, I think we should wait. Welcome, everyone. Thank you for being so patient. What do you want from us? For over a year now, we have anonymously set up a website to express our dissatisfaction and bring to light the environmental and general crimes of corporations and governments from around the world. For our troubles, we have been targeted by governments and law enforcement who are attempting to silence our right to speak. We have tried to do things legally, along the lines of what would be deemed acceptable by society. Despite the fact that the crimes we have been reporting are atrocious. We have now been pushed too far. We are forced to take more extreme action. What do you mean? You've been brought here so that you can answer for your crimes. What crimes? You are not a court of law, and we haven't committed any crimes. The evidence we are going to present will prove otherwise. Why are we talking to a cartoon character? Who are you? I'm not a cartoon character. I'm Sophie from Kronos. I right wrongs. What evidence are you talking about? This is ridiculous. Vialette will pay you to let us go. How much do you want? That's not how it's going to work, Mr. Jarnac. Well then, just so you know, none of us is going to participate in this charade. Who put him in charge? Who else would it be? Mr. Dubois, please step forward. Don't move, Dubois. No. This conversation is over. Then I suppose we have nothing more to discuss. Isn't there any way to shut this website down? Dorothy. You've been briefed? How long to shut this thing down? I just want him off the Internet. I don't care how you do it. Okay, let me know. Stop it! Stop it! Shut it off! Are you ready to talk, Mr. Dubois? What do you want from me? I said no! We have to stay united. Then what? Do you think loud music is going to be our only punishment? I'll answer your questions. Oil is something we all use and need to survive. Are we too dependent on it? Probably. Mr. Dubois is a majority shareholder in a number of pipelines that are projected to crisscross Canada and the United States. They will run from the oil fields of Alberta, through the Rocky Mountains, across the Prairies, and through the US. Out of 27 developed countries, Canada is 27th with the worst environmental record. How is that possible? Well, look who you have in power. Politicians who promised a change from a decade of Conservative rule have proven that they also answer directly to big oil. Ms. Spencer-Kraft, if you'll join us. Go on. I'm not participating in your game. But you're usually so eager to appear on camera. Let's watch. What about the deadline? The contractors are ready to go. We need to get the pipelines approved. I've set the deadline. I have everything lined up. We're just waiting on approval from a couple of hardliners, that's all. When do you think they'll give in? Soon. Soon. Just trust me. This is outrageous. Where did you get that video? You should ask your good friend Mr. Jarnac. What is she talking about? Where is this coming from? Where is it coming from? I'm not responsible. Try and find a peaceful but quick solution to this. Yes, Ma'am. After so easily bending the laws for Mr. Dubois, the next big problem for him and Mr. Spencer-Kraft is that there is a growing segment of the population that believes it would be better for the environment to ship this dirty oil by train rather than scar the countryside with more pipelines. But it would be more expensive for Mr. Dubois and his friends. I had nothing to do with that. No, you didn't directly. But like most great politicians and business leaders, you saw an opportunity where others might just see a devastating accident. And who could you get to capitalize on that opportunity? Perhaps a man who wanted something from you. Stop it! You took advantage of the fallout. You're broadcasting us. Yes. Smile, Mr. Jarnac. You're going out to the whole world. Your every word and action. Our audience is being asked to vote on your guilt or innocence. Quite simple. Maybe even a little bit fun. To anyone who can hear us out there, we need help! We're being held against our will here by some communists, bent on some twisted revenge. We've all been drugged. All of us, yes. And we're being deprived of water and of food and... Ms. Spencer-Kraft. Still a hypocrite, I see. Unless we get some water right now, we're not going to answer any of your questions. Play all the loud music you want! You're going to let them dictate terms to us? Jarnac wants water. Screw him! Let's punish them. Um... The average person can survive three minutes without air, and, um, three days without water. Let's give them some water. Wait! But wait! What about Dubois and Spencer-Kraft? We're just getting to the best part of their trial. We're gonna hold 'em off for a minute. You realize that by bringing up water himself, Jarnac's playing right into our hands? Bring it in. I won't drink this. What's this vehicle doing here? We've got company. I'm Brad Smith. Blackhawk Security. Well, you have to leave, right now. We've been dispatched here to facilitate the release of the hostages. Dispatched by who? A private security firm has no jurisdiction on a Canadian police investigation. Stand your men down, Mr. Smith. Everybody, relax. I'm only going to ask you politely one more time, Mr. Smith. Leave. This is Blackhawk November. I have a senior police officer here, you need to bring her up to speed. Thank you. I call the shots. If you step out of line once in my investigation, I won't care who you know. Understood. Who was on the phone? The goddamn Minister of Justice. What the hell is this? It's Vialette Life Water. One of your most popular brands. This is not Vialette Water. It comes from Lahore, Pakistan, where your company has depleted the water table by bottling all the available tap water and selling it back to those who can afford it. That's misinformation! This is what the people who can't afford Vialette Water are left to drink. It's been brought in specially for you, Mr. Jarnac. At great expense. Enjoy. Are we hooked up to the CCTV yet? Yes, Ma'am. I will load up the video. They've just logged into the video network, and we've got an image. Find out where this website is coming from. I can tell you that right now. It's Jake De Long. He's an underground hacker within certain radical environmental circles. Hacks into private servers, gets access to classified information, puts it on his site. He's wanted by any number of governments for treason and espionage. Find out everything you can on Jake De Long. Why don't you show yourself, so we can start negotiating? You know we've got to end this soon. I'm not risking lives. Listen, Helene, why don't we work on this together? I'll tell you what I know about Blackhawk. You are a private military contractor, that despite working under the umbrella of the US government in Iraq and Afghanistan, have acted like cowboys with total disregard of local laws. So why would I imagine you'd act any differently on my investigation? I'm here to do a job for my employer. You're here to uphold the law. What do you know? Two days ago, Jake De Long was almost apprehended in Luxembourg City. But he managed to escape. What was he doing in Luxembourg? He was on the run. No more porous borders than in Europe. On the run from who? Take your pick. Once he's caught, the US are eager to try him for treason. But his website has an environmental focus. We just accessed this information 10 minutes ago. He entered your country using a fake passport and airline ID. Moments later, he was picked up by... This woman in a stolen van. We're still trying to figure out who she is and where she comes from. Probably French. Anything on the two other kidnappers? Not yet, but it'll come. How did you get this information so quickly? Blackhawk has contracts with US, Canadian, British and French governments for security. So, how do we shut this down? Although the signal's coming from inside the panic room, it's been onion routed times a thousand. It's designed to make it practically impossible to close down. But you're sure it's coming from inside that house? Do you doubt it? Where's the black van? I say we go in, breach the room. Gadget here can get through the computerized lock in a couple of minutes. And what, we go in guns blazing? I'm sorry, I'm not handing this over to private military. Now that you've been give your water, Mr. Jarnac, let's resume. Mr. Jarnac... Vialette produces processed food, sells water and soft drinks, has a capitalization of $64 billion, boasts 300,000 employees worldwide, and has a beautiful head office in Geneva. Why are we judging Mr. Jarnac? Water is his obsession. Vialette has 80 different brands of water that it sells worldwide for a market share of $9 billion. Let me illustrate to you how Mr. Jarnac views the world. There will always be people who want something for nothing. Certain liberals want to give water away for free. These people say that water is a right. I was brought up to believe that rights are earned, not given. Our company gives value to water. Now, here's where it gets a little tricky. Much of the planet is facing a water shortage. More children in the world die of dirty water than HIV, traffic accidents, malaria, and wars combined. There are close to 40 states in the US that are experiencing a water crisis as we speak. But Mr. Jarnac has come up with a solution. Canada's lakes and rivers. They have fresh water to spare. And Mr. Jarnac now has rights to 30% of that water. How? Through his friendship with one of our other guests. Minister of the Environment, Priscila Spencer-Kraft. But what did he have to give her in exchange? Let me ask you something. Do you think I'm stupid? We don't think you're stupid at all. Perhaps just... unaware? Well, let me tell you what I'm aware of in this situation. You're just a mouthpiece, and behind you is the man who is controlling and guiding everything you say. Can't believe it took him this long to confront you. He's been stalling for time. Ask him why he thinks that. Why do you think I'm not in charge, Mr. Jarnac? How are you doing, Jake? Jarnac likes to be in charge. Don't underestimate De Long. You know him? We've had a couple of run-ins. What did you think I was going to do when I discovered my computers had all been hacked? Not find out who had done it? Why don't you tell our audience how you found out it was me? Because I make it my business to know my enemies. And why don't you tell everybody what it is you keep whispering to Ning Tang? And while you're at it, tell them who her father is. You're just a middle class moralistic little thug. I've shown that Ms. Priscila Spencer-Kraft has worked for the benefit of Mr. Jarnac. That's ridiculous. All these environmental laws should be challenged. But you've rigged the game. You think you speak for the common man? I don't speak for anybody. But if I can show them the truth, isn't it my obligation? I would caution you to be very careful what you say next, Mr. De Long. Oh, Ning Tang, please. I guess now's the time I should explain to our viewers just who Blackhawk Security are, and what they do. The Blackhawk footage, please. Join the first private army... Blackhawk Security are a private military organization owned by JPPC Investments, and fronted by Ning Tang. But just who is this enterprising young lady? Would you like to explain? No? Can we pull up the emails, please? These emails show that Mr. Jarnac personally funded the acquisition of Blackhawk Security through JPPC Investments. That way, Mr. Jarnac keeps his greasy fingers clean. But Ning Tang is the daughter of the number two man in the ruling Communist Party of China. I've built a brand! I've made something where there was once nothing. What have you done, Mr. De Long? Shown us your outrage? You've heavily destroyed the planet. What are you talking about? The planet is my market. Why would I destroy it? You're so naive. You're worried about the future of the planet. Blackhawk Security, Climate Change... It's all bullshit. Well, I can see that a lot of you are already voting on Mr. Jarnac's guilt. You're owned by the Chinese? Indirectly. This one's for you. I'm not touching that. No? Suit yourself. What did you say? Three days without water? So, not only the Canadian government, but also the USA, France, and Britain have been signing security contracts with a company owned by the Chinese? What difference does it make? To me, none. To those governments, plenty. Don't be naive. You know they are only business transactions. Well, business transactions don't usually involve spying. So, tell me, how did you get that hotel room video? What do you think? I needed insurance. Hmm. You are a son of a bitch. We've been more than patient. I'm not going to sanction storming the castle. You might get away with that behavior in Iraq, but not here. You have no idea. You'd better come and see this. As we get inside, main hall, go right. Panic room is on the left. Okay? Two, two. Go. You can't do this. Stand down. I can do whatever I want. Jake? Here they come. Looks like everybody isn't on the same page. Is everything ready? We're good to go. Oh, shit. Hold your fire. What the hell is this? It's an old bootlegger's house. Escape tunnel. We should have known this. Sorry to disappoint you. You didn't think we were gonna stay there, did you? You can't get away with this, Jake. Oh, good, we're on first name basis. And you are? I'm Deputy Commissioner of the Canadian Police. - Helene Langelier. - Oh, wow. The big guns. Well, you see, Helene, the thing is, I'm already getting away with this. We're closing in on you, Jake. Oh. Hey, Brad. How are things? For the record, you almost caught me in Spain. It's only a matter of time. Says the guy who's running out of time. How many governments do you think are gonna cancel their contract with Blackhawk, now that they know you're owned by a Chinese company? I'm gonna get you, you little prick. I'm sure we can find a solution to this, Jake. Got to go. It was nice to meet you, Helene. Can you believe that bastard? Openly threatening you! Threatening us. That guy sounds scary. He sounded angry to me. The Brad Smiths of this world will always be angry. How are we gonna get out of here? Starting to feel the heat? If it weren't for you, none of us would be in here. You believe that? Listen, there's four of us, and only ever two of them in the room at the same time. What do you suggest? Overpower them. I don't think that's a good idea. What? You don't seem too worried about getting out of here. Are you nuts? You think he's finished with me? Jesus! Assume that Jake already has everything on us. I didn't know half of the stuff he told us about you and Ning Tang. Let's try to stick together through this. Oh, yeah. A united front. Hmm. Look at this comment. "Don't leave us hanging. "What's the connection between them all?" What do you think is going through their heads? I've only got a minute, gentlemen. So, Valerie Gauthier worked for you. Is that right? Worked for us? She stole from us. She took Sophie from us on the eve of our release. She violated our business. With all due respect, I have greater concerns right now. I'm Laurent Legault, B-Wave's General Council. Sophie is the lead character in what is a sequel to one of our most popular titles. And? We've discovered our audience is overwhelmingly in support of Jake De Long and his gang. We agreed not to call them a gang. Jake De Long and his colleagues. Many of our gamers are now seeing Sophie as a co-conspirator. Why are you telling me this? As a courtesy. We're gonna make a statement to the press in order to protect our brand. It's a billion-dollar title. You're gonna come out in support of Jake De Long? Yes. You know I could arrest you for hindering an active investigation? One of my colleagues will release our statement anyway. Why can't you see that we are the aggrieved party in all of this? Give me a day before you do this. Rise and shine. I don't want people to think we've forgotten about Jean Dubois and Ms. Spencer-Kraft. Let's get back to you now. Brought you a peace offering. I could arrest you for storming Spencer-Kraft's house. As we were saying earlier, Mr. Jarnac now has the rights to 30% of Canada's water. They're back up and running. How? Through his friendship with Minister of the Environment, Priscila Spencer-Kraft. But what did he have to give her in exchange? Following that original disaster of an oil train crashing exploding and almost taking out an entire town, there have been five other derailments of trains transporting oil. Why would this be of concern to us here? Or of benefit to Mr. Dubois? What's the alternative to transporting oil by rail? A pipeline. But how can they put a pipeline across a country that has strong environmental protection, that includes millions of rivers and lakes? Do you realize in Canada we've gone from 2.5 million protected lakes and rivers to just under 159? All to make life easier for Jarnac, Dubois and their ilk. But what I really find interesting is that each of these men were in each city on the day of the five derailments. I have a meeting. Stay a minute. What is so suspicious about these five men, you ask? Well... All of these names are aliases of Brad Smith, who's a top lieutenant of Blackhawk, which we all know is owned by Ning Tang and indirectly Mr. Jarnac. It's all about the oil and water for these people. In exchange for his and Blackhawk's help with the derailments, Mr. Jarnac was given valuable water rights. Are the droughts around the world simply propaganda? Is Nevada, California, Texas propaganda? Here's the contract that Vialette has with the state of California to purchase groundwater so that they can bottle it and resell it. They pay 65 cents for each 470 gallons it takes. At an average cost of $1.22 per gallon, consumers are spending 300 times the cost of tap water to drink bottled water. There is nothing illegal about that. After a 14-year drought to be able to take 80 million gallons of water a year is a crime. A pipeline in exchange for water rights. Oil for water. Climate change is threatening our very existence. Fake news! What are you going to do about it? I've had enough of your preaching. Shut up, Jarnac! Well, what do you think, big man? Piece of shit thinks dirty oil's okay, and that people should pay him for water. The oil sands is the dirtiest type of extraction possible. Not what we need at this time. And Mr. Jarnac, I believe you're beginning to see that life is rather unpleasant without water. And if you think the oil sands is pure enough, then here you go. Yeah. Fuck them. Do it. Dorothy, give me some good news. - We can shut them down. - Do it. Do your thing, Patel. - What happened? - Give me a second. Any time I type a website name, I'm being redirected to Jake's site automatically. Help! - Turn it off. - Help! What do you think, Big Man, should we turn it off? You're killing us! It does look like the girl is having an asthma attack. - You're killing us! - Don't do this, Jake. Turn it off. You're killing us! You're kill... Help! Help! They're gonna kill us! You gotta see this. Switch to channel four. I'm Gerald McNulty, founder of B-Waves Games. Our character Sophie from the Kronos series, the new title out in two weeks, was hijacked by Jake De Long and his associates. Despite this fact, we want our gamers to know that we support Jake De Long and his attempt to right the wrongs of a political system and a corporate culture gone mad. As does Sophie from Kronos. Goddamn it! They were supposed to give me a day, not just a few hours. Are you watching the press conference? Yes, Commissioner. I just saw it. Have you got any news on the investigation? We're doing our best. We need to find a solution to this soon. Yes, I know. I'll keep you posted. I wouldn't trust eating those. Maybe they want to poison us. The water they gave us was clean though. How many days do you think they'll hold up? We've got time. We can't hold them forever. How far are we gonna take this? Until we're finished with them. I get Dubois. What makes these other three so special? I've got my reasons. That's it? We're in this together. We go back a long way, you and me. And I'd hope you'd fill us in a little more here. Yeah. Don't be like those assholes in there. What are you keeping from us? I'm not keeping anything from you. Nothing. Are we not in this for the same reasons? We've each got our part to play. But what about you? Why do you are about all this? I think about my ancestors. What the Jarnacs of history have done to my people. So this is your revenge? It does make me wanna kill them. Then what's stopping you? Just say the word. Fuck yeah. These people are a cancer. I don't think we should be talking about killing people. There you are. You got my De Long info? Some interesting stuff. Give me the Coles Notes version. Grew up on a farm, went to MIT when he was 15. A math, physics and computer prodigy. Spent the last years in Europe working as a security researcher. But what's interesting is... What happened after he left the farm? All this on his father Gary? First he lost his water rights on the farm to a company. Vialette. Jarnac's company. Then, the farm board was sold by the government to the Chinese, who didn't care that Gary couldn't bring in the crop because he had no irrigation. Foreclosed on by the bank. Bought at rock-bottom price by a corporate farming operation. Jesus! Then, one night, Gary De Long ran the new head of the farm board off the road, killing him in an accident. He just ended his sentence for manslaughter. Great work, Elisabeth. Hi, Helene. How's the investigation going? - We're close. - You think? Turn yourself in. I can't do that. What's the point of all this? Well, like I said, we tried to shed a little bit of truth on the matter with our website. But nobody seemed to care. That's it? Forget about me for a minute. You gotta ask yourself why. Hmm. Brad Smith, Ning Tang, Jarnac? Why does a food and water company like Jarnac's need their own private army? I'm sure you've got an answer for me. Water. It started with Jarnac in the 90s. He got screwed when the water in Bolivia was privatized. Then he bought it and started charging peasants who earned $100 a month $20 a month to buy his water for their farming and their personal use. They rose up in a revolt, and eventually the Bolivian government had to cancel their contract. It's a bit of a leap from that getting your own army. I have emails where Jarnac vows he'll never be screwed again. So, who's the enemy? You, me, anybody who wants water for free. Most of the wars in the 20th century were about oil, and the wars in the 21st century are gonna be about water. And Jarnac wants to be ready. He is ready. And he'll do anything to protect his market. Nobody will take anything from him again. And you feel the same? That nobody will take anything from you or your father again? So you've been doing your homework. What did you expect? That we wouldn't look into your past? That has nothing to do with... Don't bullshit me, Jake. Your father lost his water rights to Vialette. Then the farm board was sold, and the bank foreclosed. Your father was in prison for manslaughter. It was an accident. His only crime was having a bad reaction to having his life destroyed. Tell me about him. He's a good man. A hard worker. Maybe another time. But I'll tell you who's not a good man. Brad Smith. And I don't think he's gonna spend a day in prison. Don't be so sure. What's gonna happen, Helene, if Brad Smith and Blackhawk find me first? Are you afraid of him? Aren't you? I can't arrest somebody because you posted five photographs of him on the Internet. Of course not. You ever heard of the Peer Group, Helene? They're a company that's mapped the entire Internet. They can identify and get clients, individuals into particular servers, individual terminals anywhere. And? Well, I see that Blackhawk Security just paid $500,000 to Peer Group. Do you know what that means? Brad Smith is gonna be knocking on your door. What's happening? Go see what's wrong. She... She needs help. Get back. Back. Tell me where you are, and I promise I'll give you due process. Jake! Jake, look. You stay here. Shit! Drop it. Get the first aid kit. I'm so sorry, guys. Valerie, no. I should have gone in. What the hell were you thinking? I'm the only one doing the thinking, that's what. No, you're the one who got us into this shit. You were gonna beat them all to death with a pipe. Do you have a better idea? - You picked him up? - Yeah. - His mood? - Pissed. Good. What the fuck is this? You can't just hold me hostage. Listen, Brad, at this point I can do whatever I want to you. With one call I can unleash a shitstorm on your life. The Peer Group. What did they tell you? You've been speaking to Jake. You know where he is. Let me out of here right now. I can speak to my people. I'm not letting you out unless you give me Jake's location. I'm not giving you a location unless you let me out. I want to talk to you, Jake. We're sorry about what happened. What are you doing? Saving us, you dumb son of a bitch. Just shut up! I'm handling this. You're not handling anything! Oh... Bastard! Move! What do you think you're doing? You said Jarnac would pay. Why didn't you warn me about the pipe? - There was no time. - We've got to get her to a hospital. - Is she gonna be okay? - What do you think? Now you know how it feels, huh? - If she dies... - She knew the risks. If it weren't for my money, you wouldn't be here. None of this would be... You think I care about you more than Jarnac? Spencer-Kraft, Ning Tang? We made a deal, and I expect you to live up to it. Or you'll what? You want Jarnac to pay? Then you do it. Get him out of here. We've got to get Valerie out of here. I feel like I walked into a bus. She's gonna need stitches. I'm sorry. I fucked everything up. No, you didn't. It was time to leave anyway. You guys should get out of here. They're on their way. That's it? We're done? Get her coat. No, Jake. Come with us. I've got something to finish. I'll see you soon. See you on the other side, bro. What did he do to you? Nothing. Everything will be okay. No. It's not, Priscila. Although we've run out of time, I want to acknowledge our voting audience. The message is clear. The world has been convinced of your collective guilt. If you want to punish me, come and face me... Like a man. What are you doing? Whatever it is he's forcing you to do, we can... Shut up! Where did you get that? This is for my boy. What are you talking about? You killed my boy and you know it. My son was protesting at a pipeline in Alberta. Your men treated them like terrorists. They were only kids. So because you're a bad father, that's my fault? What the hell! Look at you. Pillars of society. The best and the brightest. Your corruption, self-interest and greed is so entrenched that no matter how hard you try to rationalize it, this is what we get. Let the people of this world judge you. Where are they? Signal's coming from in here. You go through, we'll go up. No cowboy shit. Go. Let's go. You... Betrayed me. It's time for you to go. Let's go. Let's go! Police! Where's De Long? He's inside. You picked the wrong man to fuck with, Jake. Go ahead, Brad. Shoot me. For the whole world to see. Fuck it. Lower your weapon, Mr. Smith. I will not hesitate to shoot you. Why not make my night and give us a full confession? Without my lawyer present? You haven't asked for a lawyer. What do you wanna know? Tell me where I can find your accomplices. Don't you wanna know why I did it? What's your connection to Dubois? Why did you give him that gun? Why did he try to kill Jarnac? Was it because of his son? You're gonna have to ask him that. Hmm. And I wanna talk about your dad. I don't believe in all this bullshit about truth and what's right. There's more here. And you're gonna tell me. You know the people behind that glass... The Brad Smiths, the Jarnacs. They're not like us. They're just happy to take the advantage work the system. I can stay here all night. We don't have all night, Helene. Time is all you're going to have, Jake. You really believe they're gonna let you charge me? What are you talking about? Go ahead. Charge me. See what happens. The US wanna make an example of me, Helene. They don't care that you caught me for a crime up here in Canada. What are they doing here? Helene, we're handing him over to the FBI. But you can't do that. It's out of our hands. This came from the very top. You're the very top. President and prime minister. The US want him and we have to hand him over. He committed a crime in our country. Sorry. You're gonna have to let this one slide, Deputy Commissioner Langelier. That's an order. You guys got the FBI plane, or are we flying commercial? For you... We got the plane. This is a nice car. What year? Looks new. 2018. You know how many computers it has? This one and the one tailing us, they have 38 computers that control everything from the steering, the brakes, acceleration, seatbelt, horn, lights, speedometer, gas gauge. They call it the ECU. What's going on? Don't stop. Let's just get him to the airport. What the fuck? Hi. I'm Helene Langelier. I know who you are. I'm looking for Jake. He's not here. He said you might drop by. So, he knew I was coming? You know that Jake was on the wrong side of the law? So were the others and nobody was willing to make them pay. Nobody but Jake. I'm proud of my boy. Even if there's a price on his head right now. Sometimes you have to take matters into your own hands for the greater good. It's nice up here. Open. Big. I've lived from the land a long time. It's always been very giving. It's the people that do all the taking. Because of Jake's little stunt, I got my farm back. Vialette lost billions. Blackhawk is out. Spencer-Kraft had to resign. And Jarnac will never recover from the public opinion. Hmm. He left something for you. Here. He wanted you to have this. There's a lot more in there to incriminate them. And some others. Said you'd know what to do with the info on there. Hmm. I'll go fetch us some coffee. Hi, Helene. I'm happy you found a way to my father. I thought you might know what to do with the information he gave to you. We need and deserve a better world. The fight goes on. See you.
