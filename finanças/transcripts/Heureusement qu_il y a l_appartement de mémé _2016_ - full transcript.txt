Oh what a game! These guys are fabulous. And what about that flying kick! My nervces are still all frayed! Damn, what a goal that was! Yeah, that guy—Joshua! There you are, Joshua! -Joshua! That goal was incredible. - I must say "Bravo Monsieur!". And Tété? Tété! Tété's double! Tété's double! Tété!s double! Tété's double! Hush. You're gonna wake up the whole neighbourhood. - I burped. Tété's double. THANK GOD THANK GOD WE HAVE EACH OTHER Have you seen the time, Franck? - Yes, but hey, you shouldn't have waited up. We won 4-0! - And you gave him alcohol, too. - Oh, that's OK, just a little beer. - He has school at 8 tomorrow. You do know that? - No, no, I start at 9. I don't have maths this week. - All right, Vincent, go to bed please. - Come on, get to bed, big boy. - OK. - You need to relax. Do you realize the state you get yourself in? All this for a football game? - I'm talking about your son's education, Franck. He's thirteen. He's at middle school. - Well exactly. He's thirteen, he's a kid. You're always on his back. "Do this, don't do that". Kids, we won! You really piss us off, watching us all the time. It's exhausting. - You think I'm not exhausted too? Having to take it all on, all by myself? Home, work, kids— You're never here, you don't have a job. - I'm not here because I'm looking for a job, believe it or not. And they're not easy to find— - Stop it Franck, you've been unemployed for two years. It's been six months since your payments expired. - Well, tonight I talked to a guy from the Football Federation and it's not impossible that one of these days I could be a professional trainer. - Yeah yeah— - See? You don't believe me. You don't believe me because you don't trust me. - Yeah, of course. - Just don't be surprised when the day comes— - What day's that, Franck? - Oh never mind! You're pissing me off. Where are you going? - Mum wants me to leave the house. - Why? Because of yesterday, isn't it? But where are you going to go? - I'm going to look for a flat. Don't worry, it'll be fine. - No, wait, I'm coming with you. - No. - Yes! All right? - Yeah, fine, you? Good. - Defence, damn it! Defence! There, there! - Defence. What are you doing? Take it! Now, pass back! Come back to the centre! Back to defence! Quickly! Damn! Run! Don't stand still! Come on, go again! Why am I all alone here? Vincent! Dinner's ready! Vincent! Dinner's ready! Hang your jacket in the hallway. - It's OK, I'll do it later. - Do as I ask, Vincent, please. What the fuck do you care where it is? Is it going to kill us? There! Happy? Dad's right, you're always sulking. At least he's a laugh. He's happy. Why does he have to leave? - Come on, give me your plates, kids. - This is his home too. You can't decide everything. And we want him to stay, I'm warning you. - Come on, give me your plate. - I don't give a shit about your quiche! Fuck! Come on, eat up, kids. What's going on in here? It's quarter past seven. Wake up! Come on! Go, go, go! Mum. Mum, it's quarter past seven. Mum, it's quarter past seven. Mum? Mum, wake up! Mum! - What's wrong with her? Wake up, Mum. Mum? Please! Please! Monsieur! Please can you come? What's happened? - Come! What's going on? Yes, about forty years old. Apparently a suicide attempt by ingestion of benzodiazepine. - Come on kids, don't stay here, OK? Stand back. - Alert the team. Come on, here you go. - Thank you so much. All right, so there you are, I've just had your dad on the phone. He's on his way, OK? And he's asked that you wait for him at home. - Good morning, Monsieur? It was you who called us? - Yes. - Do you mind staying with them until the father comes back? - Well, I mean— - Thank you very much. You're Monsieur—? - Belaz. - OK, so M Belaz will stay with you. All right? And you don't have to worry about your Mum, she'll be fine. All right? What's your name? - Vincent - Clément. - Clara. - What class are you in? CM2, CE1 and 5th. - CM2, that's the 10th, isn't it? That's it? - I don't know. - Anyway, it's in the 5th when it gets serious. No? Dad! - Gently, gently. You ok, sweetie? You too? - Good morning. - Good morning Monsieur. The fire people asked me to wait for you. - Very nice of you. - How is she? - She's fine. - All right, well, I'll leave you to it. I'll leave you to it. - Good bye, Monsieur. - Have you seen Mum? - No, but I got the doctor from the hospital and everything's fine. Two seconds, sweetie, while I take my jacket off. - What's wrong with her? - She fainted. - Why? - Because she got her medication wrong. You know, the stuff she takes to sleep. She took a little too much, and suddenly she fainted. OK, you two, would you make me some coffee? Go! No, I'm doing it, stop. - You'll spill it. So I'm the one putting the thing in. - I told her twenty times she was taking too much of that shit. But your mother, just because she works in health, knows better than everyone else. - When will she be back? - I don't know, two, three days? But I'm the one holding it. - No, I'm the one taking the cup. We can't even call her. Can you imagine? I can drop off some stuff for her, but I've been told I won't be able to see her. It's not because you're older than me— What's going on in there? Can you two stop arguing? Believe me, now's not the time. Thanks. Right, go and get yourselves dressed then. You do have to go to school. And give me your carnets. I'll write you an absence note. Are you going to tell them Mum's in hospital? No. We're not going to go into that. None of this is anybody's business. Go on, would you go and help them get dressed? Yeah? - OK. It'll be fine. What are you doing? - Yes. - Damn, Ronan, you scored. -So what's this? An "unforeseen event"? - Well, actually, it's because my mother didn't wake up. - She overslept? I don't need to— - No, no. - Yeah yeah, I'm telling you. Go on. - Thank you Sir. - Come on Vincent. Come on guys, get your fingers out of your arse! - Hey! Where do you think you are? - All right let's go, come on. Come and play! Play! Shit, Goal! Change the keeper! Pass the ball! Pass the ball! No, you're not disturbing me. I was just about to cook. The little ones are in bed. For the kitchen, we can keep what you have. For the bathroom, this is practical. Then we can have something special. No chemicals. Then at last, it's new. Perfect. All right, I'll call you back. What? Me too. - Was that Mum? - No, I told you we couldn't call her. - So who was it then? - It was a—a mate from football who's found me a flat. It's a bit far from here and there are two or three things to fix. But even so— The best part is, I can move in right away. - But maybe Mum would be OK with you staying here? If you ask her. No, she wouldn't. I know your mother. Once she's made up her mind— I'll wait 'til she comes back, and as soon as she's here— - And how are we going to see you? - Well, you'll come and see me in my new flat, as soon as I'm settled in. - Yes, but it won't be the same. - It will, you'll see. We'll get used to it in no time. OK? You won't be the first to have parents who've separated. My father left when I was two, you know? I never saw him again. But hey, I'm not going to repeat that. Don't worry. And of course we'll still see each other at football matches. I'm counting on you, OK? - OK. - Yeah, yeah, hello. - Is he still hanging around here? That guy's weird. I heard he's been in jail. - What did he do? - I don't know but hey, better stay away from him, yeah? Come on, go to bed, big boy, it's late. - Good night Dad. - Good night. OK, hugs. Move away there! Go to the centre! We understand! - Shut up! Come on, damn it, stop laughing! Come here! Go, come back. Look at Vincent, he's all alone. Come on Vincent, go back to the front! Come back Vincent! Vincent, stop! Do a centre again. Vincent, you suck. Stop shooting when you shouldn't! Shit! Good evening. - Good evening. - Any news from your Mum? - She's fine. When's she coming back? - I don't know. Bye. - Bye. But you have no idea how long she's going to have to stay there? No, I understand. But hey, it's not for me, you know. It's for the kids. All right. All right, thank you Doctor. Fuck it! - What's the matter? - That was the hospital. Mum won't be able to come home right away. She has to go to a clinic and rest first. - Oh no— - Yes. - Where? - At the seaside. - But when will she be back? - They don't know. They're not telling me anything. It's "look after your kids". She needs to rest, apparently. She gets to rest, but me? Anyway— - I'd like to talk to her on the phone. - Yes, I know, but it's not possible at the moment. That's the "protocol", as they call it. It's the doctors who decide when we can call her or go to see her. - So you won't be able to move, then? - Oh yes, yes, I will. I have no choice now. I've signed up, paid the deposit, and of course— My friend is counting on me. - But what are we going to do then? Will we be alone? - No, we'll find a solution. Hey, listen, do you know Mum's pin? - 5476. Why? - For shopping. Luckily I kept it. Oh look! Popcorn! - Leave it, it's disgusting. - No! Leave it! - Stop! Stop! - What's all this about? - He doesn't want me to have this! - Mum said it's full of crap! - Oh let him have it, if it makes him happy. Right? OK! Come on. Oh well, I have to go. The match is at four, so if I want time to warm up the guys— No, sorry big boy, but you have to stay with the little ones. - Can't they stay by themselves? - You know how it is. If we win, I'll be late. Plus, it's a really long way. - Yeah, but it sucks! - I want to go too. It's always just Vincent. - This is new, you wanting to come. - No, I've said it before. - That's not true, you never said that! - Yes I did! - Well, we'll see about that next time, OK? - I want to come too. - I said we'll see! And don't make that face. There'll be other matches. Bye kids! - It's OK, next time we'll all go together. - Shut your mouth! Nobody asked you! - Me too, I have the right! - Shut up yourself! Vincent. Vincent! - What's the matter? - Dad hasn't come home. Maybe he's dead. - Stop that! Allo? - Dad, it's Vincent! - What's the matter? - Where are you? - I slept at my friend's house. I told you not to wait up for me. What's wrong? - Nothing, we wondered where you were. When will you be back? At the end of the afternoon. And I have good news to tell you. - What news? - I can't tell you yet. I'll tell you later. - OK, see you soon. I think Mum will be home soon! - Yeah! - All right, let's get dressed! Come on, hop to it! Come on! Let's go go go! Vincent, Vincent, Vincent! Vincent, you kind of... No! You idiot! Shoot! Yes! - Come on, come on, go back to the centre! It's me! - Here he is. Well here is Vincent, the eldest. - Hi. And this is Céline. - She's coming to look after you until Mum comes back. So she'll come after school, to help with homework, dinner, bath time. Not you, the little ones. And then on weekends, I'll be there. Isn't Mum coming back? - Not yet, Vincent. I've already told you. - I have stuff to do at the flat tonight, so Céline will stay and have dinner with you. It's a chance to get to know each other a little. Céline, I entrust everyone to you. - No problem. - Bye kids. - Bye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Hey! Who's going to look after us at night? - You'll be asleep at night. It doesn't matter if I'm here or not. Look, the other night, everything was fine. All right, I'm off. I'm going to be late. Don't wait for me, just get to bed. And please? Be nice to Céline. OK? OK? - OK! - Be brave, big boy. What's your Mum's name? - Sylvie. - Sorry? - Sylvie! - She's very pretty. You take after her the most, don't you? - No, I look like my father. - No no, I don't think so. You really look like your mother. Do you want some more? - No thanks. - What? Don't you like it? You've hardly eaten anything. What's the problem here? Holy shit, I only painted it this morning! - So what's your mother's job? - Private nurse. - And your father? - He's unemployed. - Yeah, but he's going to be a football coach soon. - I'm not hungry now. - No, you finish it. I'm a real ecology nut! With me, there's zero waste. - It's because she doesn't like peas. - Seriously? So I broke my arse for nothing? Did you know greens are very good for bowel movements? You don't know what bowel movements are? Well, they're really important. Go and brush your teeth. And brush your teeth properly! Because I didn't brush mine enough when I was younger. Result: They're yellowish. You see? Look at my teeth. Do you agree they're yellowish? You notice because they're actually more yellowish than the whites of my eyes. That's how you see it. Look. Don 't you see? Anyway. Was it because your father's leaving that your mother tried to kill herself? No, I only ask because my cousin, when she broke up with her boyfriend— at least more like when he left her for another girl— well—she wanted to kill herself, so she swallowed a box of my aunt's sleeping pills. So they had to pump out her stomach to clean out everything she had inside, and so on. In fact, that was a cry for help because she was so pissed off. A suicide attempt is often just that. But maybe, for your mother, that's not it. I really don't know. What did she tell you about Mum? - Nothing! - Hey, where's the powder for the dishwasher? Thanks! Nice! Yeah? Hello big boy. Did I wake you when I came home? - Where did you sleep? - Well—at the flat. We were painting until 4. You do know it's Saturday? You can go back to bed. There's no school. - No it's OK. - Tell me, how did it go with Céline? - Well— - What's that "well" mean? - Well, for one thing, she said Mum tried to kill herself. - What? Hang on, she said that in front of the kids? - No, just me. - All right, come on. Two minutes. Come and sit down. First of all, not a word to the little ones. All right? In fact, not a word to anyone. Because I don't think Mum really wants people to know. - So—it's true then? - Listen—That's what the doctor said. - Why did she do that? - I don't know anything about it. She's the one asking me to leave. And as soon as I do—she fucks up. That's the trouble with your mother. That she doesn't know— She doesn't know what she wants. She's inconsistent. Either way, she's always been like that. It's not new. Why are you crying? - Because— It's weird. - Yes, big boy, but— That's how it is. Above all, don't blame yourself. It's nobody's fault. It's life, that's all. You know the expression "life's a pile of shit"? Good. I have to finish all this. We'll still try to have a good weekend. Thanks. There. Watch out. Thank you sweetie. Here look, I'll put it on your seat. Should I fasten the belt on it too? Right, goodbye my little ones. See you next weekend. - I don't want you to go! - I know, sweetie. But I'll be back. And you be nice to Céline, OK? Come here, big boy. It'll be OK. I trust you. - Yeah. And if there's a problem, you call me. - Yeah, but keep your phone next to you! - Promised! - Let's go, ciao kids! - Good morning. Work hard! Your what? - My Bar Mitzvah. Look, it's written here. It's celebrated when boys become adults. - Boys don't become adults at thirteen. It's at eighteen. - Eighteen's the legal majority, but— From a religious point of view, it's like at thirteen you're an adult. Well, it's not like real life. I don't know how to explain it. -- Will there be a bar? - A bar? Yeah, like in Bar Mitzvah. No, no, a bar is— Super pretty, long dresses, we were well dressed. And guess who we saw? Lucie's boyfriend with another girl! - Really? - I swear. He was trying to french kiss the girl properly. But then, he saw his girlfriend, he saw Lucie. Do you know what I did? I took a bottle of vodka. I bought it. Paid 200 euros! - Seriously? Yeah. 200 euros to do what? Straight in his face! I soaked him. Oh yeah! No! You didn't? - Makes sense though. What did she do next? - Long story short, she left and ran away. I don't even know where she is now. - She must be at home. She doesn't answer me any more. - Yeah, that's normal. Either way, she deserves better than that. You see, this guy was a bastard. Yes. Aren't you afraid he'll come after you now? - No! And, this morning, I fought with my mother. She pisses me off. What are you doing? - Nothing. - You taking the piss? - No. - Allo, Baby, are you talking to me? - Fuck it! The kids! They're pissing me right off already. I'm off! Vincent, can you take out the bin, please? - Can't you do it when you leave? You could surely help a little. I'm not your servant! - It's fine, OK! I'll do it! OK, bye! - We're not going to do everything anyway. Where are you, Cracotte? Where are you? Oh, there you are. Come on! Come on, let's go home. Come on, let's go home. Come on, you've walked enough for today. Come on! Come on, let's go home. Come back in. Come in, it's hot. Come on! Hey, Vincent. - What's the matter? - I peed my bed. - Didn't you go before you went to bed? - I did, I swear. It's not my fault. - So what, it's still you doing the pissing, not me. What's wrong? Are you worried? - I don't know. - OK come on. Let's change your sheets. Go on, have a good day. You coming to mine? - I can't. - Just call your Mum and ask her. - I can't, I told you. - Why? - She's not here right now. - Where is she? - Working. - And your father isn't here? - No. - Well then, you can come. - OK, but not too late. - Yeah, don't worry. Now? - I'll start, you ready? - Yes. I don't know. Something's missing, you know? I mean your instrumental is good. But then, I don't know, for example, we could add percussion. - Ah that's good! Go ahead, go ahead. Just the percussion. - OK. Go ahead. It's good! - Yeah. - It's good! - That's good! - Boys. Boys. It's almost eight o'clock. Vincent, I'm not asking you to leave, but maybe you should go home. - But Mum, wait, we were working— - Yes, well you can finish another time. - OK. Did you tell your parents you were here? - They're not there anyway. Wouldn't have mattered. - Oh really? - They work late, that's why. Bye Madame. Thanks for everything. - Bye! - Bye. - Come on, let's have dinner. - Listen to this first. - Léo! Yes, it's cooked enough. It's al dente. That's how the Italians cook it. Anyway, I just have to make do with what I've got. If you don't like pasta, ask your dad to buy something else. Ah there you are! Where have you been? - I did my homework at a friend's house. - And you're allowed to come home this late? - Yes, I do what I want. - No, I'm responsible for you. - For the little ones! Not for me! - Really? Well, guess what— I'll talk to your dad. Let's see what he has to say. - He'll say the same as me. - Go ahead, sit down. You get on my nerves! I'll let you help yourself since I'm not responsible for you. What do you imagine, kids. That we can always do whatever we want in life? - Is there a problem? - No, but I've had enough. they piss me off. No respect, nothing. I'm fed up with this. There! - Right, you going to eat or not? - The way you talk to them! You're hot! You definitely shut them up. - Hey! Yeah? - It's me. What's the matter? Céline came with her boyfriend. So what? - Using our bathroom like we weren't there— yelling at us when we hadn't done anything. All right, listen, I'll come home early and I'll talk to her about it. OK, see you later. It's OK, he's going to talk to her about it. - What is he going to say? - He'll fire her, that's for sure. It wasn't me. - You're lying! - Big liar. Who was it then? - You really are a fat pig. - Fat pig yourself. - Oh the atomic fart! - Oh Clément! - It's Clara! - No! - But it is Clara, I'm telling you. - Clément, stop. - There! It was you! Come on guys! - What are you— Yes that's right, yes that's good! Go forward, we'll pass it to you! - Come on Vincent, shoot! Move forward again! Come, go! Shoot! No, not on the ground. Yes! Shoot! What does your mother do for work? - She's a private nurse. Why do you ask? - My mother wanted to know. Want another one? - No thanks. - All right, bye! - Bye! Hi. -Hi. You'll be happy, I'm leaving. I'll be back later in the week to get my money. Did you fire Céline? - No, she left. It seems you weren't very nice to her. And you especially, you were rude to her. That's it? - She yells at us all the time. Plus she brings her boyfriend. - That's not your problem! - Well, actually— He yells at us too. - Yeah, and the result is I have to find someone else. As if I'd nothing else to do! Where did I put that piece of paper? Leave me in peace, I've some calls to make. Good evening, I'm calling you on behalf of Mr Lambert. He gave me your contact information. I'd like to speak to Mrs. Lombard, please. It's for occasional babysitting. When possible. Thank you. LILAC CLINIC General psychiatry for adults All right, I'm holding. Thank you. Yes, Amandine. I've already called her but she can't. And you don't know anyone else who might be interested? Well, if you hear from anyone, give them my number. OK. Thank you. Bastards! Fuck it! Yeah, you walked in at the right time. I can't find anyone to replace Céline. I don't know what we're going to do. - You really can't stay until Mum comes back? - Don't start with that again. I already told you it's not possible. Know what? I'm gonna pop some pills too, and go for a rest at the seaside. - I can take care of the little ones, if you want. - You're thirteen, Vincent. - Yes, exactly. At thirteen, I'm almost an adult. - So you'd be fine having the little ones from Monday to Saturday? Taking care of everything? Laundry, food, homework? - If you tell them to do as I say, and if you come back at the weekend. Do you realize how big a favour you're doing me, big boy? I'm proud of you, you know. Are you ready? - Yeaaaah! Wow! Is that the new team jersey? - Yeah. - Too handsome! - Have you felt the material? So I got three for you. - Oh great! - Yeah! - For you Sir, for you Sir, and you Madame. You're beautiful, honey. ♪ We are the champions! ♪ ♪ We are the champions! ♪ ♪ We are, we are, we are the champions! ♪ - Who are we? ♪ We are the champions! ♪ ♪ We are the champions! ♪ ♪ We are, we are, we are the champions! ♪ - Who are we? ♪ We are the champions! ♪ ♪ We are the champions! ♪ ♪ We are, we are, we are the champions! ♪ - Come on! Dad, I want to give you a hug. - OK, hug. - Dad, another one, another one. Again! Again! - I'm going, I'm going now. Me too? - No, stay inside, or you'll catch a cold. All right, big boy— I left you Mum's credit card on the hall cupboard. - I won't need it if you're coming back this weekend. - It's just in case. Right then, goodbye darlings. Make sure you double-lock. - Don't worry! So. Come on. All right, I'll leave the sponge near you. If you piss, you can clean it, then you'll be fine. OK? - OK. What's the matter? - I want to see Mum. -I know, Clément, but Mum will be back soon. - What if she's dead and Dad didn't tell us? - Of course not! If she was, why wouldn't he tell us? - So we won't be sad. Oh no! Not both at the same time! What is it, Clara? - I don't want us to be alone forever. But we're not alone. There's all three of us together. That's what counts, after all. We're all together, the three of us. One! Two! Three! Ladies and gentlemen... Vincent? - Yes. We always stay like this, right? - Yes. Come on now. Time for sleep. Allo? - Good morning Madame. Is that the Lilac Clinic? - Yes, I'm listening. - I'd like to speak to Madame Frouchard, please. - May I ask who's calling? - Her son. - I'm sorry, but I'm not authorised to put you through to her. For now. - Can she call me back? - I'll have to talk to her doctor first. Is it something important? - No no. I'd just like to talk to her. - Well, I'll see her doctor and if she can, she'll call you back. - All right. - OK? - Thanks. Goodbye. Hi! Touched again. Come on, start again. Yeah, I passed! No new messages. Ready—go! OK Baptiste, you're under arrest. - Go and see who it is. It's Céline. - Right, put the steaks in the pan and watch them. - All right. Hi. - Hi. Did your father give you my money? - No. - Shit, does he think I'm stupid? I left him a message that I'd be dropping in today. What time will he be back? - He'll be back on Saturday. - Seriously? Dammit, that's so annoying. Not like I've got nothing else to do. Especially since I found a job on the other side of town. Hold on, are you by yourselves? - Yes. - And it's OK, you're managing? - It's OK. - Isn't it against the law to leave children alone? - No? - Of course it is, it's forbidden. Your father'll be in deep shit. If someone finds out you're alone, you'll go straight to a children's home. Hi sweetie. What a beautiful jersey! If you want, I can stay five minutes, since I'm here. - No, no, it's fine. - OK. Right, I'm going to text your dad again. I'll come back another time. - OK - Ciao! - Ciao. - Vincent, quick! Vincent! Vincent! What have you done? - Nothing, I swear. - Are you stupid, or what? You almost set the house on fire! - But I didn't do it on purpose! It just popped up! - Fuck! I'm going to tell Dad! He'll rip your arse off! - Stop! - Fuck! - Stop! - You really are a little prick! - Stop yelling at us! What's wrong with him? He says he's tired of you thinking you're king. I don't think I'm king, Clément. I was just scared. That's all. - I'm telling Dad you hit me. - But you hit me too. Look, I'm sure I'll get a bruise. Tell him Clara. - No that's not true. I didn't see anything. - Don't touch me! You know, if we tell Dad what happened, he's going to worry. And he won't trust us any more. That's why you shouldn't tell him. Hey... Since the steaks are ruined, know what we're going to eat? - I don't care! - Really? You don't care? Don't you care either? You both don't care? Are you sure? You two don't care, right? You both don't care, right? You both don't care, right? I'm going to show you how we don't care. Come on! Aren't you two afraid of me? Scratch my back! Little tickles! Tickles on my back! All right, hurry up. At school, we mustn't say our parents aren't here. OK? - Why? - Because if we do, they'll make trouble for us. So don't say anything, OK? - OK! Please turn off your screens before you leave. You coming? - Yes, don't worry, I'm coming. Bye. Bye. Goodbye Eric. The child suffering parental abuse. Child neglect.

I wanted to know if you're OK. And—if you're feeling better. And if you— - Who are you calling? - No one. I couldn't sleep. - Why are you crying? - Because I hurt myself. - Where? - Over there, on the table. All right. Come on, let's go to bed. Dammit! You still haven't tidied the living room! - I'm just finishing watching something. - That's it! Enough bullshit! - No! Stop! - If you want Dad to be happy to come back, you better get everything tidied up. - You're not in charge of us! Actually, I am! And you're not going to start pissing me about again, Clément. You do what I tell you, OK? - We're not your servants! - You clean up! And you too, Clara! - No, I don't feel like it! - You're coming with me! You're going to tidy up! You're coming! You're getting up! - Stop it! - Fine! If that's what you want, you can look after yourselves! I've had enough! Vincent! Vincent! Come back! We're going to tidy up! Vincent! - Vincent! Vincent, we're sorry. - Vincent! We're going to tidy up! - Vincent, we're going to clean up! We're really sorry. Come back! We're sorry. - You swear you'll do as I tell you? - Yes, we swear! Allo? Yeah, it's Dad. - Where are you? Listen, I'm still at the flat so— I'll join you later this afternoon. All right? - OK, see you later. - OK, hugs. - He's coming later. - I knew this'd happen. We tidied up for nothing. All right, let's go shopping. That'll give him a nice surprise. Can I get the trolley? - No! Me! - One puts in the token and the other pushes the trolley, OK? - OK! - One, two, three! Oh no! Oh no, no, no. Ha ha, I have it! All right go ahead! How are you sweetie? Aren't you too tired? We'll go through there, OK? Can I have this? - They're really beautiful, I think. - Yeah. - Actually, Vincent isn't nice enough to buy it, you know. But next time, we'll ask him. - Yeah, but I don't know if he'll say yes. - We'll see. Come on, little baby. A spoonful for Mum. And a spoonful for Dad. That's great, sweetie! Dad! - Hi sweetie. You all right? - Yes - Hi, big boy. - We tidied up the whole house. We did the dishes. And I made my bed. - Good, it's great! Where's the mattress? What's the matter? Are you sulking? If it's because I didn't come home earlier— I had appointments for a job so— - I saw you! Earlier, in the car park. I saw you. - Good. So now you know. You know, deep down, I prefer that. It wasn't much fun having to hide. Listen— It's not just a fling. Her name is Marina. We've known each other a year. And as you saw— We're going to have a baby. That proves it's serious, right? And now the fact is, she wants me with her all the time. It's normal, you must understand that. But that doesn't mean I'm going to abandon you. - What about Mum? Is that why she asked you to leave? - Yes. See? I'm not lying to you. But you know— Even if it's still a bit early— I'ill introduce you to Marina soon. She's dying to meet you— - And Mum? When are we going to see her? - If the doctor agrees, we could go Saturday or Sunday. And if he doesn't agree, we won't give him a choice. OK? - It'll have to be Sunday. Because on Saturday I've got Léo's Bar Mitzvah at 4. - But—Yeah yeah, I'll be here. Don't worry. It'll be good for you to have a little fun. I'm glad we had this little talk. - It was weighing on me, I swear, to— not to be able to tell you anything. The baby—you know? It's a boy. I hope he'll like football. Come on, come on, counter-attack! Move your arses, fuck it! - Garel! enough of that language! Now! - Sorry. Not playing today? - No, I don't really feel like it. - The other day, I saw you'd been doing some research on child neglect. Can I ask why? - Because— Because in my neighbourhood, there are— There are actually people who often leave their kids alone. That's why. But everything's fine at home? - Yes, yes, everything's fine. There's a lady who told my mother to call the police. But my mother, says we shouldn't do that. Because the kids could end up in care. - You can tell your mother she can call 119. It's a special number for issues related to children. - OK. - But— Do you think they're being abused? That they're being hit, or anything like that? - No, no. Certainly not. Did I answer your question? - Yes. Yes thanks. - You're welcome. - Come on! Come on Vincent! Quick, start again! Everyone in defence! - Well? - He says it's for neighbours. But I felt he was uncomfortable. It doesn't smell good. - No. Good. Thanks Stéphane. Vincent, come and look! - What? - Quick! - What's going on? I'm here, hush. You're not alone any longer. You're not alone. Can I hold it? - No, I saw it first. - Quiet, you'll scare it. Poor little cat. - It must be lost. It's so cute. Its belly is rumbling. Maybe it's hungry. Hi. - Hi. - Did your father give you the 50 euros for Céline? - No. - Is he fucking with us? When's he coming back? - I don't know. - He didn't leave you anything when he went? Cash? A credit card? - No. - No no, wait! What did you buy this with? Hey there! What's going on here? Don't worry about it. Everything's fine! - No, it's not fine! What do you want with this boy? - His father owes us money! - So what? You're hitting his kid? Can't you see how old he is? - He's owed me the money for ten days! - I don't care. - If I don't get my money, I'm calling the cops. And I'll tell them he's abandoning his kids! All right, calm down please. Let's tone this down a bit. Nobody's calling anyone. How much does he owe you? - 70. - Well, there's 35. - Yeah, that's OK. Come on. Are you OK? It'll give you a boost. Oh, I'm such an idiot! What would you prefer, little man? A glass of water? - Yes thanks. - Here. Do you want something to eat? - No, I'm fine. - Go on, it's time for a snack. It'll do you good. You'll see. My grandmother used to do this for me when I was young. And believe me, there's no palm oil in there. And there you go. - Thanks. - Is it good? How's your Mum? Any good news? - We're going to see her this weekend. - That's good! You must be pleased. Especially since things can't be easy— with your father. I have the impression he's not around much. All right, don't worry about it. I'm not going to pester you about that, don't worry. Come on, Want another one? - No, it's fine. I'm good. You know, the— Men all have their little weakness. You see, for me— It's still a bit like that. One evening, I had a bit too much to drink. And got a little pissed off at my wife. The neighbours called the cops. And boom! Three months in jail. And believe me, jail is no fun. But OK. I know I deserved it. In life— when we make mistakes, we have to pay for them. That's normal. Oh look! There she is! Well? Where have you been? What's up? What is it? What's the matter? Yes yes. She's very sad. She lost her little baby. She had six. I gave five away. So there was one left for her. But the other day it went out into the garden and I haven't seen it since. Hey beautiful. Someone must have taken it. D'you think? - Yes, but I have to go. Bye. - Bye. Hey! If you have any problems, come to see me. Now that we know each other. - Thanks. Off you go. Hi, you've reached Franck's mobile. Please leave a message. - He's very annoying. - Yeah. She's really sweet though. My Sweetie. - Would you be OK if I left you all alone? Until Dad arrives? - Why? Where are you going? - To Léo's Bar Mitzvah. I'm already an hour late. Yes, but I'd like to hold her because Clément always gets to. - That's not true. You've held her plenty of times. - Can I go or not? Yes. I'll leave you my phone. If you have a problem, you call Dad, OK? - OK. Well, I'll let you hold her for five minutes then you give her back to me, OK? - OK. - See you later. - She looks very playful. - Too cute. Yeah, hi. Good bye, Monsieur. Thanks. - Bye. Bye Madame. - Goodbye Vincent. Did you have fun? - Yes - Are your parents coming to pick you up? - No, I'm going home alone. - Would you like me to drive you home? - No it's fine. Thanks a lot Madame. Bye. - Bye. Psst, Vincent! I wanted to let you know your dad came home and we had a bit of a fight. - What about? - Well, I was helping your brother and sister look for the little cat that had run into the street. And your father didn't like it. - What did he say? - Well, there was no reason for the kids to be outside, and I shouldn't have talked to them. And you should have been there. In short, he wasn't happy. - About the cat, I wanted to tell you we'd got it. - But you know I'd have given it to you. Go on, get inside. Where've you been? - Léo's Bar Mitzvah. I told you. - Leaving your brother and sister all alone? Are you completely irresponsible? - But you said you were coming home in the early afternoon. I waited for you until 5. Do you know where the kids were when I got here? In the street with the neighbour! Looking for a cat. What cat, anyway? You think I don't have enough with you three? - Just a little cat we found. And the neighbour's nice. He lent me money to pay Céline. - What if he's a paedophile? Have you thought about that? You know that's how these paedophiles attract children! With sweets or money. Can you imagine what could have happened with your brother and sister? For fuck's sake, how can I trust you now? - It's your fault too! You never keep your promises! We spend our days waiting for you! - As a matter of fact,I wasn't there because the baby was born! I was at the hospital when the little ones called me. Marina had just given birth! I had to leave her alone. You think it's nice for her? - You do the same to us! You leave us all alone all the time! You don't give a fuck about us! Or Mum either, you don't give a shit! You haven't even called her to ask how she's doing. - But I told you we couldn't call her. - I don't believe you any more! Anyway you lie all the time! - All right, no need to get upset. - Let go of me! Look, now, I really have to leave because of the baby. We'll talk about this tomorrow . We'll put things straight. And I'm sure— - Tomorrow you promised we'd go and see Mum! - Yes. Yes I know. But with the birth of the baby, tomorrow's going to be complicated. So I can't tell you when, but I swear we'll go. Could you keep Soquette until we come back, please? And thank you. Wake up, let's go. - Where to? - We're going to see Mum. - Yes? - Hello, we're here to see Madame Frouchard. - Visiting starts at 2. OK, thank you. Too bad. Well, in the meantime, we'll go to the beach. - Cool! - Yeah. - Beautiful! - Come on then, let's get something to eat. - No, not yet. - Can't we wait for you here? - OK, but you don't move from here. And if anyone talks to you, don't answer. It might be a paedophile. - All right! We'll try to dig further down. It has to be really smooth or else the cars can't get past. Clara! Clément! Clara! Clément! Sit down, I'll be right back. Tell David that if he's not happy, I'll put him on duty on Sundays, on holidays and at night! Good morning - Good morning Well? So you've lost your brother and your sister? - Yes. - Well, we've found them. Don't worry. - Yeah, but where are they? - Well, since we didn't know who to call, we took them to a shelter for the night. - Oh no! But— It's just for the night. Don't worry. As long as it takes to call your parents and for them to come and get you. Come on, it'll be fine, big boy. - Come on, calm down. Here. - Thanks. - It'll be fine. What's your name? - Vincent. Vincent Frouchard - And you live here? - No, we came to see my mother. - Where does your mother live? - She doesn't live here, she's in a clinic, near the beach. - And your dad came with you? - No, we came alone. - But he does know you're here? - Vincent, do you have his number so we can let him know you're here? - No, but it's not worth bothering him. Anyway, we were about to go back home. - But we have to call him anyway. He must be worried about you. Don't you think so? And anyway, we can't let you go on your own. Are you afraid your dad's going to yell at you? Is that it? Good morning - Good morning Hello Vincent, I'm Elisabeth, head of this centre. - Vincent! - Vincent! How are you? Did you sleep well? Clara and Clément, would you like to follow Nathalie? She's going to take you to breakfast. I'd like to talk to Vincent. - I want to stay with you. - Will you come with me? - Go with her. - Come on. Come on, let's have breakfast. Don't worry, we'll be back soon. First, there's good news. After breakfast, we'll take you to see your Mum. - But there's still something bothering us. The policemen who brought you here, you know? They called me back to tell me there's been a report on your family at the police station in your town. It's a report for child neglect. - Who said that? - Certainly someone who cares about you. But really, who said it isn't important. What matters is that we need to know if it's true. Would you mind explaining to me what's going on at your house, Vincent? Look out! I'm coming! - Look out! English subtitles by jeremys amd Marseille TNT 2023
