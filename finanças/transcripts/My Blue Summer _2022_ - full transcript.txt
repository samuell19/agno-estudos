We had a deal. You can't back out now. Our investment will go up in smoke. Mr. Zhao, the decision has been made. I cannot accept this. It's a breach of contract. As long as the contract isn't signed, it is not a breach. Mr. Sakamoto is right. The formal contract hasn't been signed. You're not in breach of contract. However, may I remind Mr. Sakamoto, the signed letter of intent clearly states that, before signing the formal contract, you shall not negotiate or partner with any other trustees. That's great! I'll put in another 500,000! Good! We make the money. They clean up the mess. People play this game just for the money, and I'm a master of the game. I'm Luo Zhi, a professional lawyer, and my job is to win every single game. Luo, you're so brilliant and good-looking. How come you're still single? Here's to our hotshot lawyer. Hotshot lawyer! Only I know I bury myself in my work to forget him and all those memories. The program not only offers 21 scenic spots free to the public, but also there are over 50 affiliated shops. Isao Takahata, the renowned Japanese director, died on April 5th. As an internationally acclaimed animation director, Isao Takahata brought audiences heart-warming works such as Only Yesterday and Grave of the Fireflies. In memory of Isao Takahata, the City Art Gallery is holding a special exhibition named "Only Yesterday," attracting a large number of fans. Sunny days, cloudy days and rainy days, which one do you like? ONLY YESTERDAY SUNNY DAYS, CLOUDY DAYS AND RAINY DAYS, WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE? THOSE WHO USED TO WATCH ISAO TAKAHATA WITH ME, HOW HAVE YOU BEEN? TRACES OF TIME TO THOSE WHO ARE LOST IN TIME IF I COULD ONLY FULFILL ONE WISH, I WOULD BE WITH YOU FOREVER ALTHOUGH WE LIKE EACH OTHER AND WE'RE ALIKE, WE ARE WORLDS APART DONATED BY SHENG HUAINAN ISOLATED ISLAND Hello, ma'am. Can I help you? Sorry. This diary is mine. Can I have it back? These are personal items donated by fans. If you want to claim it, you need to show me your ID, and I'll contact the donor. Just a minute. I used to keep a diary, which was all about one man, Sheng Huainan. The easiest emotion to protect and to destroy in this world is unrequited love. It's an emotional experience. An unforgettable experience. It all started when I was eight. Do you have to splash water all over the floor? Daddy. Luoluo. Daddy wants to talk to you about something. Okay. We just received a batch of machines at the factory. I have to break my word. I can't make it home early tonight. But you promised. I'll buy you that frog raincoat we saw at the department store. But Mommy said it's too expensive. Don't tell her yet. What are you whispering about this time? Come back early. Come back early, Daddy. Okay. Go, go! That phone call and the frog raincoat are my last memories of my dad. He died in a work accident. From that day on, Mom became a different person. Besides looking after me, she only cared about fighting to get the survivor benefit. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Why don't you play with us? What's your name? I'm Sheng Huainan. Huainan, be a good boy and come here. Wait here. Take your medicine. Come! Slow down! Ma'am. What a marvelous wedding! Mr. Sheng couldn't attend? If he attended every event, he wouldn't have time to work. Right. He's a busy man. About the survivor benefit… Please ask him to do us this favor. Our family has done everything we can for your family. It will simply be extortion if you keep pestering us. How can you say that? My daughter lost her father at a very young age. And he did die in a work accident. You should answer for it. Don't make a scene! And don't be ridiculous! Come on! Faster! - Hit her! - Hit her! Her shoes are worn out! Hit her! Give me the car! Push him down! Push him down! Push him down! Luo Zhi! What are you doing? You're having a good time, aren't you? Do you know who he is? You can't play with him! Let's go home! What happened? Where does it hurt? Tell me! Tell me where it hurts. - Hurry! - Who did this to you? It was that girl! ZHENHUA HIGH SCHOOL Hurry up! What's your rank? I made it to the top 20! Top 20! Luo Zhi! You made it to the top 10 again! You're awesome! - Let me see! - You're in the 10th place. Hi. Make way. Make way, please. Sheng Huainan. Sheng Huainan. Who is it? I heard he just transferred here and he's super handsome! Has anybody met him? He has tons of running shoes and fancy cars. Is he the guy who always wins the Mathematical Olympiads? My desk mate Yu Huai is a big fan of his! Now you're in the 11th place. Cut the crap! The whole thing is obvious! The machine malfunction is what caused the work accident. Mr. Sheng must have taken a bribe. Isn't it obvious? You call that insufficient evidence? We can definitely sue them! You're not paid to sit around! Stop talking nonsense! I want to speak to your boss! Who's in the first place? Who said you could rummage around in my bag? Give it back! Do you think I'm blind? Do you think I don't see this? Who erased it? I single-handedly provide you with food and clothes. I pay your tuition. And you just lie to me like this? A bald-faced lie! Don't just stand there! I'll be in the first place one day. It's reserved for me. The monthly exams are now over. To our wonder, and to our dismay, a transfer student has gotten the first place, which has invigorated Zhenhua High School and served as a wake-up call for some students. Please welcome to the stage, Sheng Huainan! Hello, everybody! My name is Sheng Huainan. As a high school student, I see the college entrance exam as a mountain, and our mission is to climb over it. Having said that, the road is still long ahead of us. The college entrance exam may be just a hill blocking our view. What is waiting for us on the other side? I feel terrified. Sheng Huainan. I'd never thought the boy from my childhood memory would walk into my life again one day. SHENG HUAINAN For him, our brief encounter back then was just an incident long forgotten. But for me, it's the opening of a ceremony. He became my first opponent in my youth. My only opponent. SUNNY DAYS, CLOUDY DAYS AND RAINY DAYS, WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE? Next group! Boys' first group. Get ready for the test! Hurry up! Ready, set… Come on, Sheng Huainan! It's Ye Zhanyan, the school babe. She has the same shoes as Huainan. Really? They cost a fortune. What a coincidence! Ready, set… Come on! Come on! Ye Zhanyan likes showing off. Sheng Huainan doesn't like girls like that. Zhanyan runs really fast. - Get ready… - Wish me luck. Set… Come on! - Come on! - Come on! Wenrui! Wenrui! What's the matter? Did you get hurt? What's going on? Who's that? - What's going on? - Are you okay? Hey, fatty! How do you fall over while running? Simple! She's too heavy to keep her balance! My lucky charm is missing. It's gone? My lucky charm is missing. Come on, everyone! Back off! You won't find it. No need to waste time. What are you looking for? - What did you lose? - Face! - She's not looking for… - Shut up! What are you doing? Cut it out! Luo Zhi! Forget it! Let's go! Wait up! Is this yours? Thanks. Found it. RAINY DAYS. I LOVE "ONLY YESTERDAY" TOO. ME TOO. ACTUALLY YOUR CHEMICAL EQUATION IS WRONG. I DID IT ON PURPOSE. YOU PLAY THE PIANO? YOU SAW ME? ONLY FROM THE BACK. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? CAN WE MEET? What are you babbling about? Stand up! Up! Don't lie down! Get ready! It's show time! Settle down! Hi, Zhanyan, over here! You stand up front. Let's listen to Zhanyan's a cappella version first. Ma'am, I think it'll sound better with a piano accompaniment. Nothing's ever good enough for her. She's so finicky! Hey, be nice! Zhanyan's got a point. But it's too late to find a suitable player. I know someone who's good enough. Sheng Huainan. Sheng Huainan? - I see where this is going. - Okay. Sheng Huainan, please help us out. The school hunk? Wow! Stop it! Did you practice that move? "Outside the long corridor, along the ancient road." To your right! "The green grass seemed to connect with the sky." Go over it! Outside the long corridor along the ancient road The green grass seemed to connect with the sky Trees, move! Trees! It's your cue! The night breeze caressed the willows and the flute resonated Whilst the descending sun illuminated mountains by mountains Ma'am, I want to quit. What? You want to quit now? Do you understand what it means to have discipline? - Why didn't you say so before? - Ma'am! I think it's only fair to earn the lead singer part. Right! You believe it's unfair, yes? It's unfair! Okay. You can give it a try if you think you're up to the task. Go ahead! Come on! Go, Luo Zhi! Outside the long corridor along the ancient road The green grass seemed to connect with the sky The night breeze caressed the willows and the flute resonated Whilst the descending sun illuminated mountains by mountains At the edge of the sky and the corner of the land… Very good. Come here, Zhanyan. Stay focused! To your places! To your places, now! Outside the long corridor along the ancient road The green grass seemed to connect with the sky The night breeze caressed the willows and the flute resonated Whilst the descending sun illuminated mountains by mountains At the edge of the sky and the corner of the land The friends in hearts have gone their separate ways If we had a bottle of distilled wine to celebrate the rare reunion It wouldn't be so cold tonight Sheng Huainan! I like you. Wow! What happened? Somebody just confessed! Who's that? This time next year, we'll have graduated. And I don't want to have any regrets. Say yes! Say yes! Say yes! Say yes! Say yes! - Disappointing. - It's not funny. What a bummer. Hey! Zheng Wenrui! Zheng Wenrui, are you okay? - What's wrong? - Are you all right? Are you okay? Thanks, Luo Zhi. You didn't need to do that. Do you think I'm a fool? I don't regret it. Don't you like Sheng Huainan too? Luo Zhi, you're better than me in every way. I really don't understand what's holding you back. Will we ever end up in the same world? Where's my diary? It was right here. Sheng Huainan and Ye Zhanyan are dating now. They're made for each other. Gossip about them went around. As for me, I was alone. STRIVING TO MOVE AHEAD TWELVE YEARS OF HARD WORK, ALL FOR THE GLORY OF ONE DAY COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAM COUNTDOWN 166 DAYS LEFT COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAM PRACTICE TESTS 1. SHENG HUAINAN 8. LUO ZHI 1.

SHENG HUAINAN They say Sheng Huainan and Ye Zhanyan have decided to go abroad instead of taking the entrance exam. Well, they're both wealthy after all. No wonder they just hang out and don't care about grades anymore. FEAR NO HARDSHIP Hello, everybody! Someone once said, "The college entrance exam may be just a hill blocking our view." But when it's right there in front of you, it's all you can see. My name is Luo Zhi. This is a battle and there's no turning back. And I… I can finally stand here today! Yeah! I swear… I swear… …I will not make excuses for failure! …I will not make excuses for failure! I will find my way to success! I will find my way to success! I fear no obstacles! I fear no obstacles!

If someday, I get to turn my secrets into a story, the title will be "Unrequited Love," "Regret," "Quit While You're Ahead" and "Forever Young." LUO ZHI LOVES SHENG HUAINAN AND NOBODY KNOWS IT Cut! Got the shot? Of course! Great! Your reaction was so spontaneous! What department are you in? You're a natural. Are you interested in joining our film club? I'm serious. Don't go! Hey! She helped out at the End of the World party. I just wanted to thank her and make friends. And what am I, chopped liver? I have every reason to be mad! Either you live with this, or we break up. I don't want to talk to you! Sweetie, I've checked your horoscope for this week. It says you may need to be more tolerant. Having you as my roommate proves that I'm extremely tolerant. Then time me. Sure. Here we go. Opportunities you once had will always be given back to you unexpectedly. Sheng Huainan, we meet again after all this time. Time's up! Ge Bi has gone too far this time! You shouldn't cry over a man for more than 10 minutes! Likewise, you should never let a man know how much you care about him, or else you've lost from the get-go. Well said! Then stop buying him breakfast and saving the seat for him every morning. Stop being so available 24/7. I want to cry again. Jiang Baili! Stop crying! I won't allow it. Luoluo, if you were in love, you'd understand why I'm crying. Any bread cakes left? No. A dark-skinned guy took them all. Hi! Here! No wonder they always run out. You also like bread cakes? Here you are. I can't eat them all anyway. By the way, I'm Zhang Mingrui. I study Economics and Management. I mainly run a film club though. Hi, I'm Luo Zhi. I'm a Law student. What are the odds? We both chose the course Introduction to Law. So you're the Luo Zhi from Zhenhua High School. How did you know that? I went there too. I'm Sheng Huainan. I'm sorry, but your name doesn't ring a bell. You and Ye Zhanyan were in the same class, weren't you? The teacher would take your essays as examples. So I saw your name a lot. And you just used them as scratch paper, right? How did you know that? How come it's you two who are catching up? I was the one who talked to her first! Sorry. So you're Ye Zhanyan's boyfriend, right? We broke up. You know what? They were planning to go abroad together, but he stayed here to be my friend instead. Pals before gals. The thing is, China needs you. Take me as an example. I'm striving to introduce Chinese cinema to the world. And how can I make that happen? With sci-fi! Under my leadership, the film club will produce a historical sci-fi movie to show China's progress in science and technology, its powerful industry, and concern for humanity. I've already thought of the title. Endless Love. You're made for that role. The production will start this weekend. And the lead actress is Luo Zhi. What are you laughing about? You're the lead actor. Say something! Come and join us when you're free. Please. Great! Why? Why did you save me? I don't know. Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Shot one, take 16! Three, two, one. You saw Leonids before. Can you add more "I saw an alien" kind of horror? Coming, director. We need more blood! Professionalism is key. - Hey, what are you guys doing here? - Run! Get our stuff! The UFO! Leave it! Run! It would be great if we had a good actress. I'll sit there. Hurry up! Take your seats. Today we're gonna analyze a case. Company A contracted Company B to carry out a project. To get overtime pay for the Spring Festival, Mr. Zhang, from Company B, worked for 52 hours nonstop, which resulted in his sudden death. The plaintiffs are Zhang's family. Apart from Company B, can Company A also be considered a defendant, who should take joint responsibility for Zhang's death? I think Company A should take some responsibility. What do you think? Go tell the professor. These two names are interesting. Because they are both from one Chinese poem. Sheng Huainan. Here. Luo Zhi. Here. Please come on stage, both of you. Sheng Huainan will be the defense lawyer. Luo Zhi will be the prosecution lawyer. The plaintiff's family member was the defendant's employee. When the accident happened, his labor contract was still in effect. The accident happened on a dispatch mission from the defendant. Therefore, apart from Company B, Company A should take joint responsibility. Your Honor. Yes. The plaintiff's family member was indeed the defendant's employee, but since the moment Company A contracted with Company B for the project, all obligations and responsibilities were also assigned to Company B. Although Company B was contracted, it doesn't mean Company A's responsibility to the deceased can be assigned. He was not forced by Company B or A to work overtime. So such joint responsibility is invalid. May I remind you that, in this case, he's not just a plaintiff's family member or just another Zhang. He's flesh and blood. Do you realize his death will probably lead to his family's demise? He chose to trust you. He devoted his energy and time to you. But what did you do in return? Before you contracted with Company B, did you review their health protection system for workers? He was willing to do extra work for you, and he ended up dead as a result. But you don't feel gratitude. Instead, you have even turned a blind eye. Don't you feel guilty? I agree with the prosecution lawyer's argument. - Hurry! - Okay. - What's taking so long? - Coming! Sorry for the wait. Thanks. Eat up. - I'm leaving. - Okay. Hey. Why are you here? Why do you think? I'm hungry. So I came to grab a bite. What do you recommend? It's all there. Take your pick. Be careful. Thanks. Excuse me, here come your noodles. I suppose you know that eating like this won't get me any commission whatsoever. Did I scare you? Just kidding. But why do you always walk behind me? Huh? Luo Zhi, don't work at that joint anymore. Why not? How many hours do you work each day? How much do you make? So? You're overworked and underpaid. That's the norm for most people. Hello? I'll be right there! Baili! - Baili! - Aren't you ashamed to bully a girl? I'm telling you. She came to us to sell wine! What about my girlfriend's dress? Sell wine? Watch your mouth! Okay, listen. Apologize and pay for it. You think you can bully us just because we're working students? Pay for it! What's your problem? This is a 20,000 yuan Chanel dress! Can you afford it? Can you? Sorry. I apologize on behalf of my friend. Sorry. Your dress has the wrong logo. An extra N. So 20,000 is a bit much. I'll give you 300. I'm so sorry. How dare you insult me like this? What do you want? You just want to rip us off! What do you want? Go away! What's wrong with you? Stop fighting! - They're getting away! - Go after them! Stop! Don't move! Stop! Stop! - Mingrui, let's split! - Okay! Run! Stop! - Stop! - Stop! What's your problem? - Stop there! - Don't move! Over there! - Sorry. - Thanks. You were right. I always judge others through my own lenses, and I'm self-righteous. I didn't even know I was hurting others. But then I saw you and Baili work part-time to make a living. It's good. I feel ashamed. That's okay. Your sense of superiority just saved us. So we're even. Have you watched Only Yesterday? An animation movie. Back in high school, I used to go up to the rooftop alone. One day, I saw a line from that movie written on the wall by someone else. I really like that movie. So I wrote back to her. I've been looking for her ever since. I used to think it was Ye Zhanyan. It's raining a lot. I'll get a cab. Category 5 Typhoon Talim is expected to land tonight. The typhoon emergency response is in effect. From this afternoon on, all school activities will be suspended. Students outside should return to their dorms immediately, and take preventative measures. Please warn others and don't go out without permission, unless it's absolutely necessary. FROM SHENG HUAINAN: YOU'RE NOT OUT, RIGHT? TO SHENG HUAINAN: IN THE DORM. TO SHENG HUAINAN: AT THE GATE OF THE TEACHER'S BUILDING. SHENG HUAINAN: WAIT FOR ME. Luoluo, it's raining heavily. Where are you going? I have to go. I'll be right back. Be careful. Okay. May I take it? - Yeah. Go ahead. - Thanks. Sorry I'm late. As usual! What is it? Put it on. Let's go. How much further? Not so much. Almost there. Look! That island is where we're gonna shoot! Come on, everybody! Let's go! It's a scenic place! It's so far! Be careful, everyone. Director, if the world were about to end, what would be your last wish? What a silly question! Just tell me. Give me the camera. Don't film me! I'd like to win the academy award for best actor. I'd like to get on the Forbes list. I'd like to meet someone who loves me… I'd like to be skinny. …more than I love him. Never get fat no matter how much I eat. I'm not brave. So I'd like to… do all the things I dare not do. Come here! Come on! Come over here! I'd just sit alone and watch her quietly. I'm joking. Of course I'd want all of us to be together. - Yeah! - Woohoo! A youth without regret! Young forever! We will stick together forever! - You're awake. - Yeah. Sunny days, cloudy days and rainy days, which one do you like? Rainy days. Me too. I found you at last. Don't run! You can't catch me! We've been together for a month, and I still can't believe it. I can't bring myself to tell him our chemistry and our encounter are no accident. It's more of a confession than a profession of love. What are you writing? Why are you here? Two people fall in love. Only one of them knows it's no coincidence. Omelet, beef ball and tofu. Three servings each. 65 yuan. Right? Yes. NOODLES FOR SHENG HUAINAN Here come your noodles. Don't worry. Let's go. - Bye. - Call me when you get there. What are you doing here? You followed me? I'm your boyfriend. You should've asked me to go with you. I'm afraid to lose you. Sheng Huainan, we'll be together forever, right? Right. - You're home! - Yeah. I'll take that. Why are you so happy today? Go light some incense for your dad. Sister, come on in! Wenjing, I wanna tell you… Aunt Fu. Luoluo's back! She just arrived. Here's her luggage. Don't mind me. Look! Look, this is the annex to the complaint. We've all signed as witnesses. How can I thank you? FROM SHENG HUAINAN: ARE YOU HOME? There's no need for that. I'm really happy for you. The trial starts the day after tomorrow. The authority will look into this case thoroughly this time. We finally see some hope. Even though her dad has left us so many years ago, it seems like he is still looking out for us. I want you to be there for me during the trial. FROM SHENG HUAINAN: LET'S GO TO ZHENHUA TOMORROW. Rest assured. I'll be there. Hey! Where did you get the uniform? A junior lent it to me. Where's yours? I don't have one. You can't get in without it. Go in by yourself then. Okay. Bye. ZHENHUA HIGH SCHOOL Luo Zhi, why do you always walk behind me? From today on, I'll walk behind you. Sure. Hand out the exam papers. Some even failed the poem cloze tests in this practice exam. These poem cloze tests are as easy as ABC, yet some of you didn't get them right. Latecomers, "Myriads of flowers slowly enchant the eye." What's the next verse? You answer. Stand up! The next verse is… Sheng Huainan, you're now enchanted and perplexed, indeed. After the entrance exam, you've forgotten everything you've learned. Don't you have better things to do at university? Relax your fingers. It's beautiful, isn't it? LUO ZHI LOVES SHENG HUAINAN AND NOBODY KNOWS IT Look. The messages are still here. Why did you use to come up here? Looking down from here, I could see people more clearly. And you? Why did you like coming up here? I thought if I kept climbing up, I could stand on top for the world to see me. I thought you didn't care about others' opinions of you. I don't have that luxury. I don't believe even you can be totally detached. It sounds like you've known me well from the beginning. Did you ever spy on me? Huh? Narcissist! Thank you, Luo Zhi. Thanks to you, I've changed. You're right. You've… become sillier. You big old fool! Big old fool? Sheng Huainan, will you promise me something? Okay. No matter what happens, you must remember my feelings for you are sincere. They say… romance… won't last forever. Will we last forever? ZHENHUA HIGH SCHOOL 2008 SUMMER TO SHENG HUAINAN: I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. MEET ME AT THE TRAIN STATION TOMORROW MORNING. TRAIN K152 DONGSHAN TO XIAMEN FROM SHENG HUAINAN: SORRY. FAMILY EMERGENCY. I knew this would happen eventually. It's just that I didn't expect it to happen so soon. A week has passed. He hasn't been back to school, or gotten back to me. He vanished. TO SHENG HUAINAN: I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING IMPORTANT. The Sheng Huainan from our school? Why did he cheat? No, he helped someone pass an exam. They say his family is in trouble. His dad, right? They say he asked a rich guy for help, who's also from our college. He agreed to help as long as Sheng sat the exam for him. It serves Sheng right. Ironically, the last thing I heard about him came from others. Everybody was kicking him when he was down. But I knew the worst offender was me. Mom. What brought you here? The verdict was guilty. Our hard work paid off. The man was put in prison. The woman passed out and was sent to the hospital. Your dad… your dad can rest in peace. Will you promise me something? No matter what happens… you must remember my feelings for you are sincere. During those years, I followed him closely. I thought that, if I managed to keep pace with him, we would last forever. I will not make excuses for failure! From today on, I'll walk behind you. Sure. Now I'm ahead of him, but I've lost him. Luo Zhi, what are you doing here? Are you here to gloat? You and your mom must be so pleased now. What are you talking about? When are you gonna tell him who you really are? So it was you who stole my diary. Where's my diary? Give it back! Compared to yours, my lies were harmless. Even if I failed to replace that excitement in his heart. Unlike you, the high and mighty Luo Zhi of our high school. Yet you slowly got close to him and destroyed him. In any case, I want to thank you. You brought him back to me thanks to your plot. Once his mother gets better, and with his consent, I'll travel abroad with him and finish school there. If there's nothing you can do for him, then please stay out of his life from now on. She said she had received her punishment. But now, the punishment was over. It's my turn to be punished. They say the world will end on December 21, 2012. In reality, I'm the only one who's waiting for that day. The end is near. Forget about diaries! Come on! I don't want to go. - You have to. - Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Destruction! We're reborn! Reborn! A DATE ON THE LAST DAY OF THE WORLD, 2012 Everyone is embracing the future. And I… I'm saying goodbye to the past. Huainan, thanks for being part of my youth. Your future doesn't have to end here. Go abroad with Ye Zhanyan. Ms. Luo, here's your diary. You can have it back. Thanks. Luo Zhi, how's life? Please forgive me for leaving without telling you. What I couldn't face was not your secret past but mine. I wanna give you this. When we graduated from high school, Ye Zhanyan told me everything. She gave me your diary. I didn't go abroad because of the secrets in your diary. Two people fall in love. Only one of them knows it's no coincidence. I couldn't help asking around to find out which university you were going to. I don't know if you'll still accept me. Hey. We're so alike, and so proud. These secrets are knots impossible to untie. - Uncle Shen. - Who is that? Please help my father. He's out. When will he be back? When it happened, I realized past glories were meaningless and useless. I couldn't do anything right. I didn't even know how to face you. TO LUO ZHI: I MISS YOU… Whoever holds grudges against us, - come at me! - Mom! Don't come at my son! Not him! TO LUO ZHI: I REALLY MISS YOU. I MISS YOU SO MUCH, LUO ZHI. I've always wanted to apologize to you. CIVIL COMPLAINT TO SHENG HUAMING Before my world was turned upside down, I couldn't have possibly imagined what you went through all those years on your own. Did you review their health protection system for workers? I turned Ye Zhanyan down. She went back abroad alone. Thanks to your diary, I gained strength. You are late! Hurry up! Your diary gave me the courage to carry on. My stuff is wet. You gotta move faster next time! The rainy days that we once liked have become my nightmares. Luo Zhi, on rainy days, do you still occasionally think of me? You know what? ROMANCE WON'T LAST FOREVER. In fact, I'm always around. We went with contingency fee on this lawsuit, so if we win, we'll be entitled to 30% of damages. Great! Thanks for the support! The girl I love has grown up, and now she's out of my league. Happy birthday, Luo Zhi! Thank you! Luo Zhi, happy birthday. Despite it all, I try my best to be the prince in your diary. If I had a second chance, I would stand right in front of you and say, "Your Sheng Huainan is back!" This is the last page of my diary. It's also the deadline I set for myself. I wanted to start my own business but failed. I can't be the man you deserve. Although we like each other and we're alike, we are worlds apart. We… ISOLATED ISLAND …just like the cover of this diary, are two isolated islands adrift in the world. If we met again, I would be braver than I was before. I'm leaving. I wrote down our story in the hope that you can read it one day. I love you dearly. Sheng Huainan, I haven't got off work. I'm afraid I can't see you off. Take good care of yourself! FILM CLUB A SOUVENIR FOR ALL Who are you? I'm not from this planet. An E.T.? Let me teach you how we eat. Be careful. But are you sure romance won't last forever? Silly! Romance really means that you want to continue living so that you can be with me every day. I love you. E.T.! ART GALLERY Sunny days, cloudy days and rainy days, which one do you like? I like you. I've been waiting for you for so long. Sorry. But I have nothing now. Luckily, you still have everything I like about you. You put my diary in an art gallery. Did you ask for my permission first? That's because I wanted the world to know that I love you. THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS SHENG HUAINAN LOVES LUO ZHI EXPRESS YOUR LOVE, DO IT NOW
