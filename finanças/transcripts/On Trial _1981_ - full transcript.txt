I wish you can make a fortune with your hands and don't miss me. Mabel Hi, everbody, I've been dreaming that I will have the chance to perform on stage. Today, I fulfill my dream. I can have my own concert And perform here It's because of my parents, brother, Friends and classmates. They have been supporting me. I guess you would wonder Why do I perform wearing my school uniform. I can tell you that It's just because I really missed my school life. I wish that everyone here Whether I know that or not, you will all work hard and fight for your dream to gain a better future.
