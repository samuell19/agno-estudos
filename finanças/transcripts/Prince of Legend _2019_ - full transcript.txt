The Prince of Legend? What is that? The princes of the world have gathered here. They are all fighting over one girl, which led them to step foot on the grounds of St. Brilliant Academy. - Wow! - They're shining! - Too cool! - Master Kanade! KANADE He goes to Royal Phoenix Academy where all celebrity students attend. Son of the Suzaku Group, said to hold trillions of yen in total assets. The "Celebrity Prince." Kanade Suzaku. Kanade's first aide who has been advising him since childhood. He cares so much for Kanade that he has developed feelings but hides them away. The "Glasses Prince." Seiichiro Kuon. He has a rivalry with Seiichiro and is aiming for his position. The "Underdog Prince." Gen Kaburagi. It was this conversation between Kanade and his father, Shunya Suzaku, that set this story in motion. I want you to go and see someone for me. So this is St. Brilliant Academy? Why are we here? We're here to see Kanon Naruse. The daughter of my father's first love. My sweet prince. My ideal prince. My prince! KANON NARUSE I found her. My princess. It was just an act. Those words were from a script. Open your eyes. This has to be destiny! Kanade was overjoyed to have met the girl of his dreams. Please be my princess. You're mistaken. You are my… destiny. What is destiny? It is a fate chosen by god. You're living in a fantasy, aren't you? Could you stop pushing your male fantasy onto me, please? Nothing Prince! I was wrong. That girl, she isn't my princess. My prince! He started to despise Kanon who had humiliated him but… Okay, next time go check on her at home. Are you stalking me? What? I've got no interest in you. Well, you're in my way. Did I just… - kiss her? - That was just - an accident. - I'm not thinking about Kanon! I don't care about her. I said I'm not flush red! Kanade's feelings towards Kanon have developed more over time. They're so pretty! He's the whole package! There's more over there too! - So strong! - They appeal to the men too! What a combo! They have amazing genetics! KYOGOKU BROTHERS The strongest delinquent school in the downtown area, Genbu College. The guy who reigns at the top. Innocent and stronger and kinder than anyone else, the "Elder Delinquent Prince." Takato Kyogoku. He always supports his brother, Takato. The "Younger Delinquent Prince." Ryu Kyogoku. Takato was invited to the Suzaku household back then. - Well, Kanade... - Get the police, - we have an intruder. - Where? Wait, Kanade! - What? - This guy, he's your… older brother. What? I never intended to even let you know I was your Dad, however, I have something I need you both to do for me. What? I want you to make Kanon Naruse, happy. No way! What? Initially, Takato had no interest in Kanon Naruse, but… Is she ugly? I wouldn't call her ugly. Here, this is Kanon Naruse. In reality, Kanon Naruse was… I've finally found her! …the girl that Takato had fallen in love with a year ago. Wait! Takato, you came? I'll make her happy. Wait a minute. I'll be the one to make her happy. Thank you! - My boys! - What are Kanade's true intentions? I hate Kanon. It's the opposite. I'm going to win her over and make her fall for me. I want to get one over on her. That's all! In order to meet Kanon, Ryu and Takato went to St. Brilliant Academy. I wanted to meet you! Destiny… is real. Thank you! No, thank you! She's an angel! Kanon. But Kanon had a hidden reason for saying what she did. This is payment from a job. What job? I got it from your brother. To make sure his brother wasn't disappointed, Ryu paid Kanon to be nice. You're a mean woman! Even so, you aren't bad. I like you. You're a real idiot. You didn't want to crush my dreams, so you paid her, right? But you know what? I love that about you. Ryu, is there no one you like? A strong-willed girl… Okay. …with a twisted personality… Nice. …who's a tease and doesn't know what she's doing. Was I thinking about… that girl just now? Even though my brother likes her? The brothers have different reasons for doing so, but they both transferred to St. Brilliant Academy. Over there too! I love their clothes! He looks so good with a fan! Nice muscles, Chairman! So beautiful! STUDENT COUNCIL He's the chairman of the Student Council at St. Brilliant Academy. He has the respect and love of the school. The "Student Council Prince." Aoi Ayanokoji. His second in command, the "Blonde Bodyguard Prince." Gabriel Sasazuka. But something happened two years ago. You're number one wherever we go. It's nice to meet you. I'm Kanade Suzaku from Royal Phoenix Academy. In this moment, Ayanokji felt like he didn't stand up to Kanade's princely features at all. Then, when Kanade transferred to St. Brilliant Academy to follow Kanon Naruse… Nice to meet you. "Nice to meet you"? The reason you're transferring here is for Naru… It's Kanon Naruse. …for Kanon Naruse, right? How do you know that? Ayanokoji tried to gain an advantage over Kanade. Please marry me. I refuse. You're being incredibly rude to the chairman. I want to check one thing. Can you remember my name? The only weakness Ayanokoji has is his inability to remember people's names. But you remembered that guy's name, didn't you? How exactly do you know Kanade Suzaku? You think that he likes me, but you're wrong. That's why you want me. That's not the reason. Could you stop pushing your male fantasy onto me, please? The only thing I can do is try again to get Kanon Naruse to be mine. What did I just say? Kanon Naruse. Wait, Chairman! Did you remember her name? Chairman! You're the first girl whose name I've ever remembered. Whatever happens, this must be destiny. He feels destined to be with Kanon after overcoming his only weakness. There are more coming! They're such good dancers! - So cool! - So cute and refreshing! NEXT St. Brilliant Academy's economy class. They're a group of unpolished gems that shine when polished. This is the man at the center of this group. Cool and hard-working, the "Dance Prince Red." Koki Tendo. He naturally makes people feel at home. "Dance Prince Gold." Kaiji Hiura. He loves his friends and is overflowing with chivalry, "Dance Prince Black." Riku Odajima. Koki met Kanon two years ago. I was stuck to the spot for a while. That's how precious Kanon looked at that moment. I decided that it was time to change. It's working. I'm not done yet. One, two, hit! I'll become someone who can protect her. Koki finally transferred to St. Brilliant Academy with Riku and Kaiji. However… Hey. I came to this school because I admire you. Two years ago, I saw you trying to throw away a picture. You couldn't and you were crying. At that moment, I decided to become someone who could protect you. I'll protect you from now on. I'm coming at you in full force. That's annoying. Wait a minute. - You're blushing. - No, I'm not! TEAM NEXT He's not giving up and always thinks of the girl of his dreams, Kanon. - So cute! - They're so fun! Now look over there! - Teacher! - Teacher! Looking good, Teacher! - He's amazing! - I'm in love! TEACHER A teacher at St. Brilliant. The man at the center of the teaching world, the "Teacher Prince." Riichi Yuki. Prince of Legend? "You qualify for the title if you are a student, a graduate, or a teacher at St. Brilliant Academy." I can still win! He came to St. Brilliant Academy as a teacher to become the Prince of Legend. To my predecessors… 1ST PRINCE OF LEGEND SHUGO GENNOMARU 1ST PRINCE OF LEGEND SHUGO GENNOMARU 2ND PRINCE OF LEGEND KYOYA RYUZAKI 2ND PRINCE OF LEGEND KYOYA RYUZAKI I'll be following your footsteps. Hello there. There is… a large percentage of princes here. He discovered that all the princes were infatuated with Kanon. Apart from being poor and unhappy, there isn't anything special about her. So why are all the princes chasing after her? Please tell me. Why can't I like Kanon Naruse? Am I lacking something as a prince? I want to like Naruse too! In order to win the Prince of Legend title, he's entering the competition to win Naruse's heart. - There's more! - They're so hot! - So sexy! - So much sex appeal! - Please date me! - They look dangerous. I'm in love! TEAM 3B Hairstylists, bartenders, band members. The three kinds of men you should never date. The man at the top of that list… He's a player. The "Hairstylist Prince." Haru Sagasawa. His friends from the 3B world, the "Bartender Prince," Sho. And the "Band Member Prince," Taichi. He's been Naruse's neighbor for a long time. My mom, she died. Really? After her mom died, Kanon was left all alone. Haru came to see her as a younger sister. That's why I'll never look at Kanon the way I see other women. But recently, Kanon's been getting more popular with men. It's worrying. I've got to make sure whoever she dates is good for her. I'll decide who dates you. If you lay a hand on her without my permission, I'll shave your heads bald. Before I forget, I went to St. Brilliant Academy. - You're a graduate? - Yes. Why didn't you try to be Prince of Legend? You've got the right stuff... Can you not say that? I took it too lightly. Why not just try for the title of Prince of Legend again? How? As a graduate student. I should go check it out. He's competing as a graduate student along with Sho and Taichi. And finally, this is Kanon Naruse. PRINCESS? NARUSE KANON Her mom died four years ago. Her dad disappeared and left her in debt. When Shunya Suzaku found out, he… Actually, when I heard she was still paying back her father's debts, I decided to take control and paid the rest in full. However, Kanon refused this offer. "I'm returning your money." "I don't know how long it will take." "I'll do it as quickly as I can, interest included." It was something my mom said. "Nothing comes for free." "Even if you're poor, don't take charity." "Money is something you make through hard work." To pay back her dad's debt, Kanon spends all her free time working. She didn't give the princes any attention. However, there is someone controlling Kanon from behind the scenes. The Prince of Legend test is held every three years at St. Brilliant Academy. He wants to find the ultimate Prince of Legend this year. The school chancellor. Mitsuhiko Jissoji. His lieutenant secretary. Yuta Hattori. It's not an exaggeration to say that I, Mitsuhiko Jissoji, was placed on this earth to find and raise the Prince of Legend. Chancellor Jissoji gave a certain job to Kanon. I'd like you to do some acting for me. Your payment would be ten million yen. What? To make Kanade Suzaku and the other princes take part in the championship. Maybe I'll date whoever becomes the Prince of Legend. - What? - What? That's what I said. With this as the driving force, the princes will take part in the Prince of Legend championship. No, I'll win. It'll be me. It's about to begin. Yeah. What's this Prince Parade? They're everywhere. I don't know where to look. There's a buffet of princes. Kanon! Kanon! Who will win the Prince of Legend Championship? And who will win the heart of Kanon Naruse? Kanon. Kanon. Kanon. Kanon Naruse. Naruse. Kanon! The holy war between the chosen princes is about to begin! Theater Version! Start the Show! Kanon. I've come to say hello on my first day. It's good to see you. Like a real prince! - He's a celebrity. - I'm jealous. Do you like them? What a waste. What? How much were these? They'll die immediately! Don't you know what romance is? If I get serious, she'll fall for me immediately. As long as you have love, you can be happy without money. Kanon. I haven't said hi properly since starting here. I planned to give this to my little sister, but I want you to have it. What is that? Some prize from a candy. To trick children into buying. It's cute. - What? - What? Get in! To think she'd like that more than flowers! This is a pretty rare one. Really? Kanade, I'm just asking, but do you actually have feelings for Kanon Naruse now? You must be joking. I want to make a fool of her. That's why I'm here. You're not lying? I absolutely hate Kanon Naruse. You won't get a head start on me. Kanon Naruse, I have something to ask you. Yes? Were you serious about what you said? About what? About the Prince of Legend. Maybe I'll date whoever becomes the Prince of Legend. What's the meaning… Kanon Naruse! In other words, you're going to date me? What? I'm going to be the Prince of Legend. It's inevitable. No, I'll be the Prince of Legend. Not while I'm around. Don't forget about me! - Yeah! - Yeah! You're here again? Still not giving up? Nice to see you too. - Peace! - Peace! The competition isn't lacking. I'm not going to lose, just so you know. I told you to dye your hair black! You're the main character, but they seem to forget about you a lot. I'm just a prize in their game. That's not true! At least not for my bro and… My bro is serious. - I don't believe you. - What? You still don't believe him? He has no reason to like me. Still hiding your feelings, I see. What's your type? A strong-willed girl with a twisted personality, who's a tease and doesn't know what she's doing. Do I like her? Wait a minute. What even is the Prince of Legend? Please let them know. Chin Chin-boy The Prince of Legend, basically, it's… The Prince of Legend is a title given to a prince amongst princes. There have only been two people to win this title until now. The first, Shugo Gennomaru. The second, Kyoya Ryuzaki. To be the Prince of Legend, you must adhere to all of these conditions. And then, the Prince of Legend must spread his legend around Japan. No! He must spread his legend around the globe. The price is mightier than the sword or the pen. In other words, the Prince of Legend is justice. This year, the 3rd championship is taking place to choose a new Prince of Legend. Thank you, Mr. Yuki The battle for that title Will take place from now That's what it is. I see. Are you serious about Kanon Naruse, Chairman? Yeah. At first, I was just thinking about her as Kanade's rival, but now… You're the first girl whose name I've ever remembered. Whatever happens, this must be destiny. I'm in love with her. Understood, in that case, I'll support you completely from here on. Please do. - You have serious competition. - Yeah. I came to this school because I admire you. At that moment, I decided to become someone who could protect you. I can't lose this. Right. Kanon, I'm going to become the Prince of Legend, and then you can date me. I'll give you everything. Just wait. I'll fight for you. Let me protect you, Kanon. - Master Kanade is the only choice. - It'll be the Chairman! I'll win! - Yeah, me! - Master Kanade! - The chairman! - No, Master Kanade! Let's play this fair and square. Yeah, no hard feelings. That's what I want. Let's get ready for the championship. Let's go! Come on! Please, let me be the 3rd Prince of Legend. Are you going for it too, Teach? The Prince of Legend. You're… Naruse's brother next door... Haru. I'm a hairstylist. That's it. Honestly, I didn't think you'd enter the Prince of Legend Championship. I miscalculated. Come on. You're the one who told me that graduates could take part. Why not just try for the title of Prince of Legend again? As a graduate student. Oh, right. When I heard you failed the test during high school, I… made yet another rival for myself. It seems like we're the only ones not after Kanon. That makes us comrades. I'm counting on you. I'm going to make my dream happen. This Prince of Legend Championship is going to be one hell of a battle. Yes. All thanks to Kanon Naruse. It was lucky she had experience acting from her work in independent films. We were blessed thanks to Chancellor Jissoji's desire to find a new Prince of Legend. No, unfortunately, it wasn't me. This is the will of God. Naruse, you're the princess that will find the 3rd Prince of Legend! The Chancellor's plan to use Kanon was moving steadily along. By the way, what events are we having in this championship? The Prince of Legend has been held twice before. It's become a championship watched by the world. Because of that, this time, we will be streaming worldwide during the event. The more the stream makes women around the world swoon, the more we can teach about the wonders of princely education!

Why don't we run away together like this? How precious! He's like a god. HEARTS LEADERBOARD PRINCE OF LEGEND CHAMPIONSHIP I'd like to to test just how princely they can be in a fight situation.

The real battle starts now. I'll turn this around. Must be a grading error. That's made things clear. Being popular is different from being princely. - Announcing the last event! - Okay! The Date Showdown. You all have thirty minutes. Your goal is to take her on a date and make her happy. A date? I haven't been on one for a while. Neither have I. We can't make it to Kyoto in thirty minutes. Now, please look toward the main stage. Let me introduce your date. Kanon. Great! A date with Kanon. A date with… her? I've got to take this seriously. Damn. I'm nervous now. Kanon, you look great! Wow, the balance between our heights is great… Doesn't matter. We'll be filming the dates live and broadcasting them live. Everyone watching, if your heart skips at any point, please send heart marks. Comments are also welcome! Most hearts can be won from the date showdown.

You're the first girl whose name I've ever remembered. Whatever happens, this must be destiny. It's exactly what you said. You think that he likes me, but you're wrong. That's why you want me. My motives were tainted. But now that I remember your name, I have fallen for you. I… Think I've fallen for you harder than you think I have. KOKI TENDO BASKETBALL DATE Oh, Kanon! Thank you. I didn't do that on purpose. Okay. I thought I wasn't ready, but that stops now. I'll never lose how I feel about you. I'm coming at you in full force. Kanon. If I land this shot, I want to ask you something. Koki! You take me on! - Bring it! - Come on! Okay! I'm not quite ready yet, but I'll keep trying my best for you! RYU KYOGOKU HOME DATE This is delicious! I'm glad. Really! That's a relief. Hey, Ryu! You've found a great wife! Wife? What's a wife? - Is it tasty? - What? - I want one! - Give it ten years. Okay!

That's why I've always dreamed about playing catch with my kids one day. Doesn't matter if it's a girl or boy. It'll be so cute. Oh, I wasn't talking about having kids with you. What? I've not planned that far ahead. I made a mistake. I assumed you were a heroine on the side of justice. It turns out you're just a fallen angel! Kanon, you're a mean woman! Even so, you aren't bad. I want to always be yours. I'm confident in one thing. What is that? There may be others that like you, but I know I'm the one who likes you the most out of them. KANADE SUZAKU PIANO DATE Kanon. Come here. Please sit. This is for you. For me? That's got to be a foul. I wish I didn't see that. That's what I expected from him. The competition is over. Excuse me. It can't be. What? Don't become anyone else's. Kanon, please be mine. Can you stop acting? - I'm not! - I'm leaving. It's time to announce the results of the Prince of Legend Championship. Takato. I've finally realized. I think I like Kanon. You just realized? The winner of the 3rd Prince of Legend Championship is… Kanade Suzaku! Kanade. Master Kanade! You did it! What the hell? Seriously? No way. I wasn't enough. - Thank you. - You're the 3rd Prince of Legend, - Kanade Suzaku. - Thank you. Congratulations. Congratulations, Kanade. Thank you. It really suits you. I can only think you were born to be the Prince of Legend. I've got somewhere I need to be. We look forward to working with you in your new role. Me too. I'll do anything for the school. Thank you! You'll be the best Prince of Legend ever. Thank you so much. Where is Kanon? Kanade. I thought you just wanted to make a fool of her. I figured it out during the tournament, I think I like Kanon. Master Kanade, Kanon is leaving. Kanon. I'm the Prince of Legend. What are you up to? As you promised... I didn't promise anything. What? This was a job. What? Maybe I'll date whoever becomes the Prince of Legend. To make Kanade Suzaku and the other princes take part in the championship. I can't believe it. Is she serious? You're lying. What was the point of this? Why did we try so hard? We did this for you! You did it for yourself. What? You just wanted to know who was the best. You're wrong, I… I was just an excuse. - That's not it! - You just wanted me to love you because I annoy you, right? Tell me I'm wrong. I'm know I'm right. Kanon, I… I took this job to pay back your father, who cleared the debt my dad left, as soon as possible to clear my head. That's why? I don't care how hard you all try. My heart won't change. I don't feel guilty about that. Why? If you expect things from people, they'll just betray you I understand now. I really do hate you. I hate you too. Naruse, head home soon, please. Okay. What are you doing? Nothing much. Can you forgive her? What she did. It pisses me off. Making us do all that. But… if she can pay back some of her debt, I'm happy. She doesn't rely on anyone, she's always made it on her own. You really are different, bro. What? I'll never beat you. What? - I'm being serious. - Are you dumb? Not as dumb as you. What did you just say to me? - Hey, wait! - I'll drop you! - Stop. - I'll do it! - Try it, idiot. - Shut it! I got it, sorry! What are we doing? Bro, go and tell Kanon how you feel. Only you can make her happy. I'm hoping so. Why does she do this? What? We have a fan meeting tonight to inaugurate you as Prince of Legend. Okay. Kanade. Are you okay? Why wouldn't I be? Aren't you doing too much? I'm okay. If you say so. What are you doing this evening? Working. When do you finish? At eight. I'll come meet you after your shift. What? Let me take you out. Not on a fake date, on a real one. But… I'll be waiting. Kanade. I'm going to tell her I love her tonight. You're still going for her? Yeah. I see. It's okay, right? You don't have to ask for my permission. I got it. PRINCE OF LEGEND FAN MEETING Master Kanade! SUZAKU KANADE How are you all doing? Thank you for coming. I'll always love you! Thank you! Please give it your all! - I'll support you! - Thank you. It's never been this busy before! As expected from Master Kanade. It turns out that I definitely can't win against Kanade Suzaku. MIND, BEAUTY, BODY No, one loss doesn't decide everything. But my mind is clear. I'm not focusing on beating him anymore. I'm going to live as myself from now. That's good. Listen, Chairman. In my opinion, you'll always be number one. Thank you, Gabriel. It's nothing. By the way, are you over Kanon Naruse? Yeah. That love burned out at the championship. I see. You may not be interested anymore, but I picked this up earlier. What is this? Kanon Naruse threw it away. Kanade. You were being the worst today. That's not true. Master Kanade was great as the Prince... Let me guess what you're thinking about right now. Go on then If Takato confesses his love to Kanon, how will she reply? I'm not thinking about that. How long have I known you? As your second-in-command. As your friend. I can't change it! What can't you change? Takato is the only one who can make her happy. Why is that? When she's with Takato, her expressions soften around him. She's never done that with me. When she's with me she's always so sullen. I've never seen her smile. Maybe she has mood swings. I'm not what she wants. Master Kanade, you have a visitor. Ayanokoji? Look at this. Master Kanade. This is from the party two years ago. You think so? Where'd you get this? Kanon Naruse threw it away at school. What? Kanon did? Yes. She was here that day. She was working at the event that day. I think I understand now. She's been holding onto this photo for two years? Why did she throw it away? It seems important to her. It isn't anymore. What? When did she throw it away? Today. Kanade. You need to go. Are you okay if Takato takes her from you? - Kanade! - Master Kanade! I'm going. Thank you. 2 YEARS AGO Okay, cheese! Thank you! Look. She's soaking wet! - Look at her. - Too embarrassing! I feel so sorry for her. She's still in her clothes. Are you okay? Grab my hand. Thank you so much. He and I live in completely different worlds. I need to forget him. I don't know what you've gone through these past few years, but I know you've always cared about me all those years. Even so, I… You've waited for me like a good girl, Nothing Kanon. I'm not waiting for you, Nothing Prince! Why do you talk like that? Are you stalking me? Like I'd stalk you! Are you stupid? I absolutely hate Kanon Naruse. I'm not thinking about Kanon! I don't care about her. I said I'm not flush red! Please just get in the car. I didn't understand my feelings, but I finally understand. Kanon. I don't care about destiny. I have one thing I want to tell you. You didn't do it. Do what? This. It's a habit you have when you're trying to suppress your feelings of excitement or sadness. You only do that around one person. He's the only one that gets your emotions working. That's not true. Hey. See? It hurts. But… when you do it around him it doesn't, right? This is my loss. Kanon. Why are you here? Where's Takato? Right. What is it? Kanon, I found this. Hey! Give that back! I heard you've had this for two years. I only look at it sometimes. It doesn't mean anything. I thought you hated me. I do! Can I ask you something, Kanon? What… What is it? What is destiny? It's a fate chosen by god. I said that before, didn't I? But I was wrong. What? I mean you are the opposite of what I thought was my ideal woman. God can't be the one to pick our soulmates. Even so, it annoys me to admit it that I can't think of anyone but you. What? Let's choose our own destiny. Okay? But I'm not... I fell in love. I lost. Kanon, I love you. He's late! What is he doing? He's on a date. He should be back by now. So cute. Wait, what did I just say? What? No, it's nothing! I told him to tell me when he's on the way home. Do I like Seiichiro? I'm not giving up. I'll devote myself to becoming the Prince of Legend. I'm going to get more and more beautiful! I love women! Me too. Me too! This is great. Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! Kanon, I hope you're happy! Gosh, I want a girlfriend too. Shouldn't you give up on Kanon already? Kanon will always be in the Hall of Fame. I mean she's my dream girl. Why don't we go pick up some girls? That's not what I want. I want something more spontaneous, something that feels like destiny. Some kind of older Cinderella. He's not going to have a girlfriend for a while, is he? Definitely not. Chairman. About the present you ordered for Kanon Naruse. Naruse? What? Oh, you mean Kanade Suzaku's girlfriend? Have you already forgotten her name? It looks that way. Hey, you liked Kanon, didn't you? What? - You knew all along, bro? - Of course I did. I was pissed, so I didn't say anything. Are you serious? I can't believe we like the same kind of girl. It's just a coincidence. Let's move on to the next fight. I'm not going to lose next time. You don't get it, I'm not falling for the same girl as you ever again! Bring it on! Kanon, shall we hold hands? Yes. Merci.
