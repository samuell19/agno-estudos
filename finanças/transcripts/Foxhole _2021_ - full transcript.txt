And leave our work here unfinished? That don't sound like you, Morton. Look at him, he's half dead already. We'd be accused of abandoning our post for no good reason. You got something to say? Uh, I think he should have a chance. [Clark] Why should he get a chance when all those men out there didn't? It's too late for them now. But he's still alive. It wouldn't be right to just let him die like all the others. "All the others?" Those men out there gave their lives. That's why, don't you see? It'd be a sin to let him die. I mean, when all is said and done, it could be a whole lot better for him after this is over. [Clark] Hey, you. You free before you joined up? What's that got to do with it? A great deal, I'd say. [Wilson] He's a soldier, just like you and me, and that's all he is, as far as you're concerned. [Clark] That may be, but I-- still, I can't help but wonder what he was doing wandering around all alone. I ain't heard of any colored units nearby. You boys? It just seems to me like he coulda been deserting. Well, he must have got separated from the rest of his unit. [Wilson] That unit of his 3rd Mississippi's been on our tail since Vicksburg. Vicksburg? That's before Clark and my units joined up-- All right, all right. As far as I know, if he's a slave, we have no obligation or duty to put his life before our orders-- [Morton] You oughta hear yourself, you make me sick! I'm just trying to think this through! Can't you tell it's the right thing to do, Clark? I'm not sure it's the right thing to do. It would mean abandoning our post and going against our orders; I'm not sure that's right. You all can dig, I'll take him myself. Like hell you will! He-- he-- he'd need a stretcher. That's two men! We don't know if there's more graybacks waiting for us out there in the fog. One got him. We don't know which direction they're moving. We could walk right into 'em. If Jackson's right about the rebel position, they'd be coming up that road, just past the ridge there, and the hosital is in that direction. You think it's worth the risk? Yeah. I don't think we should let this man die. [Clark] Probably already have. [Conrad] We'll never know if we don't take him in. Conrad, you'll take him. And Clark, since you've proved yourself such a lousy digger, you'll go too. Why do you get to decide that?! Would you prefer we voted on it? Morton and I'll stay here and finish, and the two of you will be back here by nightfall. [Clark] Back?! You think you can make us take him all the way there and come all the way back? [Morton] Clark? Fashion Jackson a stretcher. [labored breathing] Look... we're stuck out in this fog, waiting to kill, probably be killed. That's out of our hands.

Right now, he's just a... he's just some Fritz who jumped into our cover. We can't just kill him. My orders are to lay this wire and get you boys back safe, and I intend to do so.

Just see a lot of sand, Sarge, but Conrad's got you on the .50. [Jackson over radio] 50 yards, closing in. Jesus fuck. [gunfire] Contact! I'm going for it! [Conrad] Fuck, the sand's kicking up!

[Jackson] What the fuck do you think we're doing?! [Clark] I'm saying we're stuck here in a Humvee and-- This is the safest place for us to be. [Clark] Safe, man?! Look at fucking Doc! -Look at Gale, man! -Where did that happen?! -Where did that happen, Clark?! -[Clark] Outside. Outside! So we're gonna sit our asses in here! Do you understand me?! Corporal, do you understand me?! [Clark] Yes, Sergeant. Sit your ass back and we're gonna think this through. Calm down. Doc... can you walk? [Wilson] Maybe with a brace. -[whispering] Fucking shit. -Doc... Doc, your leg's broken? [Jackson] Doc, we're gonna have to find a way to get you out of there. [Wilson] We're gonna have to do it nice and gentle because if I start bleeding too fast, I'm gonna pass out and nobody's gonna want that, trust me. Is there a way we could do it without you losing consciousness? I mean, we gotta do something 'cause-- Will let you me worry about it?! ♪sparse tense music♪ [Clark] Hey, Gale?

[Jackson] Clark, I said hydrate. That's an order. [Clark] You can't order me to drink water, Sarge. That'd be like ordering me to take a piss. [Jackson] I don't give a shit when you piss.

Sky full of fine smoke, everything burning, no reason. It's one of the most beautiful, horrible things I'd ever seen in my life. [Clark] Why the hell are we still out here? Oil. [fly buzzing] [Conrad] I got movement, Sarge. How many? [Conrad] I count five silhouettes. [Jackson] What are they doing? [Conrad] Uh... looks like they're unarmed and they're just... walking around the RPG blast. They're collecting their dead. So what are we doing? Are-- are we just gonna... are we just gonna sit here? Are we engaging? What do we do, Sarge? [Jackson] No, we let them collect their dead. We're human. [whispering] Fuck, man. [Jackson] You gotta retain that. We need a new position. [Clark] Now we need a new position. First, you say we stay in the Humvee. Now, we're in the Humvee, they're not shooting at us. Why do we need a new position now? [Jackson] Corporal... I was wrong. I was wrong about keeping us here. I was wrong about the RPG, we all know that. And I was wrong about not flying the red flag as soon as we got separated from the convoy. That's on me. But something I know I'm right about is that we need to decide... if we can leave this up to chance... or choice. Now, we can wait here 'til after 0600 to see if the convoy comes... we can pray that they do... but all the while, those motherfuckers out there... will be coming. How long do you think it's gonna take them to realize that they have us? If the convoy hasn't come at 0600 tomorrow... we can't wait any longer. Couple hundred yards in this direction... is a ridge. If we can make it there, we can pick them off as they come. They'll move here and they'll use the Humvee for cover. That means we need to either bring or destroy anything they can use against us. Conrad, disable the ma deuce. Now... we know they've got at least one good shooter; that's been proven. And we can't assume that's it. It's gonna be risky. It's gonna be an old-fashion firefight. Once that's done... we can start thinking about getting home. Any questions? [Clark] So we're leaving the Humvee? [Jackson] It's not doing us much good now. 0600 tomorrow. Fuck, Sarge, if we're not out of here by first light, we're fucking dead. Doc... we're gonna have to get you out. [Clark] Doc, it's gonna hurt like hell but we gotta yank that thing out sooner or later. It's my tibial artery. The, um... sharp edge of the box has punctured my leg and... is pressing up against it. I can... feel it pulsing. So if we... take it out abruptly or at the wrong angle... it will tear the artery and I'll bleed out fairly quickly. Can we do something to help? I mean, how do we get you out? I'm open to suggestions. The, uh, corner of the ammo box is jammed under the crossbar. Only way to get it out now is to yank it, but you say that's not a good idea, Doc? What we could do is, uh, file that corner down. Then, we'd be able to slide it out a little more slowly. It'll take a while but I figure I can do it. I think it's our only shot. [sighs] Well... that sounds about right, then. All right, I got... I got five mags. I got all my mags, but the .50 cal's almost done. I got two. [laughter] You trigger-happy motherfucker. I like killing bad guys. [Jackson] I got eight full mags. Thanks, Doc. God bless you, Doc. 0600 tomorrow. Okay. [Gale] Let's get you out of there, Doc. [file scraping] ♪tense music♪ [groaning] ♪♪♪ [grenade hissing] [blast] You see anything?

Do not mistake my saying so as complaining; I would not dare complain to you. But I hope you might rest easier knowing my absence spares you the detestable smell of my feet. Now that you're smiling, I will carry on with this letter. Old Wilson and me have been assigned to a digging detail with two other younger men from a different unit. One of them, a Maryland boy, gets on my nerves, though I think you might find him amusing. I'm sometimes ashamed of my intolerance towards humorous types. And the other boy I like very much. He has a good heart. We had to dig in and make ready defenses, and the task at hand seems too great for just four men. And my shoulders seem to creak every time I swing the spade and I worry I am becoming the old soul you always said I was. That is all for now, Gale. Please send a flower. They must be in bloom by now. Morton. ♪dramatic emotional music♪ [shouting] ♪♪♪ [gunshot] ♪♪♪ [gunfire] ♪♪♪ [gunfire] ♪♪♪ [gunfire] [Wilson VO] The worst part about war is knowing that no matter how hard you try... you cannot protect the lives of those around you.

And I think of that German, just a scared boy running from his fate, same as us, and I wonder if he made it home. Sometimes, I imagine getting a knock on the door or a letter... or meeting him... that I might silence these restless thoughts and find some measure of peace. ♪sentimental music♪ [gunfire] [Clark] I saw movement up there just now!
