[GRUNTS] [SQUIRMING NOISES] [SCREECHING] [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ON HEADPHONES] Michael. Michael. Yeah, what? You were asleep. Well, I'm awake now. Awake now. You were sound asleep. Pull over. No, I'm good. I'm good for a couple more hours. A couple more hours of what? I wanna drive. No, look, Damon, I'm fine. Really, I am. Where are we? DAMON: Spain. I knew that. Hey, guys! I am so excited traveling with you two bachelors. [LAUGHING] I mean, to have asked me along to Europe, my best buddies! I feel like one of the guys. Just one of the guys, you know? I'm coming down. What am I doing? I should be cooking. Okay, I'm going to put something together that the both of you guys are gonna just love. Uh, Sam? No, no, no. Stay right there. Don't you guys move. I'm gonna show you guys how far a Spanish peseta can stretch. Spanish peseta? That sounds sort of interesting. It stretches. Must be some kind of pasta. DAMON: It's money.MICHAEL: What? Pesetas are Spanish currency, duck face. Oh! Don't call me duck face. Everything going okay back there? Oh, just trippy. I hope you guys are real hungry. Mmm-hmm. DAMON: [WHISPERS] Michael, don't encourage her. We're gonna have to talk to her about this sometime. SAMANTHA: You guys are gonna love this. Steak tartar, I love more than anything else in the world. But you can't make it with raw pork. MICHAEL: You're right. But what killed me was you ate it. Okay, I was starved then, and I'm starved now. I'm so hungry, I could eat a... [SCREECHING] [WHINES] [SNIFFING] [WHINES] [SCREECHING] [YELPING] SAMANTHA: Hope you guys are real hungry. MICHAEL: Hey, a little night music from the big sound of Madrid. There you go. [POP MUSIC PLAYING] [BARKING] Oh, shit! [SCREAMS] What are you doing, Mikey? Jesus! Ow. Shh! What the hell did you just do? There was a coyote on the road and I swear... There are no coyotes in Spain. All right, it was a wild dog. You hit a dog? I think I did.Hey, nice shot. That's not funny. You guys, this is serious. Now, one of you will have to go out there and take a look. It could be in pain! Hey, give us a break. You guys, the poor, little thing. I'm not so sure we're dealing with a "poor, little thing" here, Samantha. Well, I couldn't bear the thought of leaving a hurt dog on the highway. Please, Michael. For me. If one of you don't go out there, I will. All right, I'll go. Anyway, somebody's gotta check the dune buggy. Here, let me out. Why are we whispering? At least there's one man around here. [LAUGHING EVILLY] Pretty dark out here. DAMON: If it's alive and it bites you, scream. At least I have the moonlight. Wonderful. Here, puppy. Here, boy. Here, puppy. [WHISTLES] [SQUISHING] What is this muck? Muck. [SQUIRMING NOISES] Lovely. [EXCLAIMS] Shit! Great. [SCREAMING] Don't do that! You nearly scared me to death!Scared you? I swear, I thought you were some kind of werewolf or something. How did you make that sound? What sound? [SQUIRMING NOISES] [SCREECHING] [SHOUTING] Well? No harm done as far as I could see. No problem. Let's switch on some light. Michael! MICHAEL: It was a dog, Samantha. It was just a dog. SAMANTHA: Yeah, well...It was an ugly dog, at that. I still think it was a lot of blood for a dog. We're never gonna make it to Madrid with the RV acting like this. Can you fix it out here? Yeah, if you can find the parts. SAMANTHA: Welcome to Duarte. MICHAEL: Yeah, well, this place looks like a ghost town to me. The people in Spain try to get to sleep before 3:45 in the morning. It's a tradition. Oh, cute. Yeah, but leave the comedy to the pros. SAMANTHA: Well, I love this. I want a cute little town, you know? A little niche in the middle of the world. I mean, it's Spain, you know? Isn't it cool? [GLASS SHATTERING] Yeah! And they serve beer. How quaint. That was strange. [IN DEEP VOICE] Michael, Damon and Samantha. Three carefree tourists on a summer European tour. [HUMMING TWILIGHT ZONE THEME SONG] Michael swerves to avoid a crazed, vicious wolf. He courageously gets out to check. He slips in a pool of blood. Suddenly, the RV is having problems. They have to spend a night in the town. A town where beer is served at the flick of a wrist. A night in the Duarte zone. [HUMMING] [SCREAMS] [LAUGHS] Damon! That was really cruel! You know I scare easily. Ow!Don't do it again. MICHAEL: And now, we come to the pinnacle of the evening. Which one of us gets to sleep with Samantha? SAMANTHA: Oh, get out of town. Good night. Good night.DAMON: Good night. ALL: Good night, John-boy. [ALL LAUGHING] Hey, Damon. Morning, legs. Sam. I could definitely fall madly in bed with you. Damon! Sorry, it's the truth, okay? I checked the undercarriage for damage, but it looks okay. Yeah?Yeah, we were lucky. But the fuel line, it's shot. Yeah?I need to find some parts before we go anywhere. Morning, sunshine. Palm Springs. We're in Palm Springs. MICHAEL: Oh, God. They're coming over here. DAMON: Look at that guys tie. Put a zip on it. Welcome. Welcome. How you do? How are you do?I do? How you do? [SPEAKING GIBBERISH] Bodi, Bodi. Mrs. Bodi, baby Bodi. You all Americans? Yes, we are. Wonderful, wonderful. Golly gee whiz and check it out, dude. Boston Dodgers and all that. Have you been here long? Two days. Leaving yesterday, but disfortunately picked up a case of curse of Calcutta. Bengal blazes, if you know what I mean. It's called diarrhea, Bill. BILL: Yes, darling. Will you please tell her to call me daddy?Baby... Do you know of a good place to eat around here? Sure do, sure do. Roger, Charlie Baker. [SPEAKS IN HINDI] What an adorable little girl. She's a rug rat. Let's go. I must eat. Oh, good, because I've already planned on fixing something. No. No, you already made the coffee. Good stuff. Did you like that?Yeah. Okay. [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] Dr. W. Borden Tracer. The infamous NASA analyst. Tell me, Professor. What does "W" stand for in W. Borden Tracer? William? Willie? Took you long enough to get here. I've been here for two lousy days. I came as soon as I got the call. It's your fault, Doctor. You and your lousy experiments. Why don't you just tell me what happened? Tell you? I'm gonna show you. Are you all right? Wait. Here, you gotta look presentable. Gracias. Here, take the keys. Go find the parts for the RV. SAMANTHA: This is a cute little place. Ow. Hey!Hey. DAMON: Ever heard of "excuse me," pal? Hey! Excusez-moi.Thank you. Come on, Samantha. Thank you. Don't thank him. I was about to pick that guy up and throw him out the window. Then... Then, I would've shot him. [IMITATES GUN FIRING] MICHAEL: Watch this. [LAUGHING] I know exactly what he's doing. It's James Cagney's dying scene from White Heat. It's nothing new. He does it all the time. DAMON: Hey, Michael! Hey, order me a hamburger, you pervert. I love you, you're beautiful, now get outta here. Isn't this a nice place? Oh, geez, I'm glad I made reservations. WELLS: Welcome to the Motel Duarte. Please. You gotta excuse the stench, Doctor. Night service sucks. Let me take your bag, please. I want you to meet a friend of mine. Lieutenant Lumpy, meet Dr. Tracer. Dr. Tracer, meet Lieutenant Lumpy. And now that we got all the preliminaries out of the way, Doctor, why does the lieutenant look like somebody just crammed a soccer ball down his throat? Lieutenant Green. TRACER: Where did you find him? Right here. He was sent down here to find out why communications with the research center were suddenly cut off. And I was sent down to find out what happened to the lieutenant. I guess they would have just kept on sending guys down here until they ran out of personnel. So, I thought it would be better just to call you directly. Just give it to me straight, Doc. Will the lieutenant ever play the piano again? I've got the situation well under control. [SQUIRMING] Fill me in on this one, Doc. Come on, give me a fucking break. Are you all right? [FOOTSTEPS PATTERING] All right, you wait right here. WELLS: I can see from here, from the expression on your face, that you've got the situation well under control, Doctor. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Michael's. Our amigo,Damon, will be right back. Right back. Our amigo. Damon. Samantha, there's something I've been kind of wanting to ask you about. Yes? Uh... All of us have been together for the last two weeks, right? Ten days. Right. What, Michael? When you look at a guy like me, what do you see? I mean, from a girl's point of view. Oh, God, what am I saying? No, you're very nice, Michael. And good looking. Well, both of you are good, great. Great looking, both. Both. Well, of course, out of us, girls seem to warm up to him first. You're very handsome, Michael. Thanks. This town is nuts. Why? What happened? Well, I found the parts store, right? It was closed. But there was this old guy still inside. Well, of course, it's siesta time. You see, it's a tradition in Spain. And many of the people, they live right in their own shops. So, that's probably why you saw somebody in there, even though it was closed. Thank you, Sam. Can I continue now? Yeah. This old guy, right? He's staring at me with this weird grin. Then, the window completely shatters because some idiot has whizzed a tire iron inches from my head. The old guy, he's completely covered with glass, with this one long sliver stuck in his face. He pulls it out and looks over at me with the same, weird grin. So, you didn't get the part? No, I didn't get the part! I tore out of the store as fast as these decathlon legs would take me. I vaulted the car that was parked between me and the dune buggy, and landed in the driver's seat. And now I'm here. Well, are you all right? Sure. Well, actually, no. Oh, Damon. Come on, it's just a small scratch. Yeah, but look. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Maybe it's another tradition. [SCOFFS] Right. The cook punches her out in the kitchen so she can bleed all over our food. What is this stuff? Especial del Dia? Let's get out of here. MICHAEL: Look, I didn't touch a bite of it, you did. You mean because I took one lousy bite, I'm supposed to pay for something you ordered and didn't even want. Yeah.I have to pay for your breakfast plus half of Sam's. Yeah. [CAR BRAKES SCREECH] DAMON: Jesus Christ! What in hell is that? TRACER: Welcome to the NASA Research Center, Captain Wells. WELLS: Doesn't look like much of a space center to me, Doc. [LAUGHING] [RAPID BEEPING] [BEEPING GETS LOUDER] [BEEPING STOPS] Where the hell is everybody? I wish I knew. AUTOMATED VOICE: Welcome to Level One, Dr. Tracer. Level Five, please. Now, that's cute. What's her name? Maybe she's got a sister. Somebody for you, Doc. AUTOMATED VOICE: You are now descending to Level Five. Welcome to Level Five. TRACER: It's open. Someone's been inside. WELLS: Something's really wrong. If you only knew. If I only knew what? Doctor, if I only knew what? What are these? Don't touch it! What is this? Canisters from Sky-lab? What the hell are we dealing with here, Doc? I asked you a question. We found living microbes in the geological samples taken from the moon, from the Apollo 14mission. They were dormant. And what does Sky-lab have to do with this? Aboard Sky-lab, we hope to study these microbes in a safe environment. Their effect on the test animals were hideous. WELLS: An alien? We were so sure they would have burned down on re-entry. And what about that poor son of a bitch in the motel room? Lieutenant Green, once exposed, only had 48 hours. And what about me? It's too late, isn't it? Christ. I can feel it. You idiot. You should've told... I'm just another test rat. You son of a bitch. You don't even know what you're dealing with here. I can see it in your face. Well, look at your test rat now, Doctor. I don't know whether to blow your brains out or... Find yourself another guinea pig. [GUN FIRES] [FABRIC RIPPING] [SQUIRMING NOISES] [GASPS] Hey, you guys. Come on, wake up! Come on! Hello. Come on, wake up! Hey, would you two know that one out of every eight people are inflicted with Elmer Fudd disease? No, I didn't know that. Guess what? [IMITATES ELMER FUDD'S LAUGH] Can I have a kiss, please? No. No? Well, then, I guess a blow job is strictly out of the question. Damon! That was really gross! You know, I don't know if you guys... Nice one. ...have ever noticed, but I happen to be a lady. Come on, he's just joking. And you can joke around all you want, but don't treat me like... Don't treat me like that! What did I do? I mean, I'm doing my part, and I know that, that was part of our agreement. But it gives you no right to treat me like some floozy! A floozy? [CHUCKLES] Yeah, a floozy! I'm going into town. I wanna do some more grocery shopping. Yeah, then we're going with you. Oh, no we're not. I'm going into town, and I'm going alone! Come on, door. Open! [DOOR SLAMS] I think you've gotta be a little more gentle with her, Damon. I mean, I think of her like she's a little sister, you know? Right. But, then again, I know your views on incest. Hands off, okay, Damon? Hands off. I've been doing all of this stuff and you guys, you don't even care! [LAUGHING] I knew it. I knew it! You tell me that we'll ask her along. She'll do our laundry, she'll do the cooking. All we have to do is pay for half of her trip. She'll take care of us. She won't interfere with our sex lives. Well, you definitely didn't want her to interfere with my sex life. You owe me, buddy. You owe me for half of her trip. I'm gonna put the most incredible moves on this chick you've ever seen. All right, fine. Go ahead. Some life-long friend you are. All right, give it your best shot. You always get the girl. But we'll see this time, buddy. [HONKING HORN] What is it? What do you want? You are in great danger. Please, I have to talk to you. What are you talking about? How long have you been in town? Oh, that's original. Ciao,baby! TRACER: Stop, please! You don't understand! Pickled... Pickled pig's eyes. [SHRIEKS] Oh, God. [ENGINE STARTING] [SCREAMING] Let me go! Help me! Someone, help me! [ENGINE SPUTTERING] Please start. Get out of here. What do you think I'm trying to do? Drive. DAMON: Hey, don't blame this whole thing on me. I've got her. SAMANTHA: Lighten up! Tell her we're sorry. You can have the dune buggy.Wait. Let me out! TRACER: You just be quiet and drive where I tell you. There's gotta be a working phone somewhere in this town. We don't have much time. Why do you think the townspeople have been behaving the way they are? SAMANTHA: Where does kidnapping me at gun point rate in your books? He's got Sam... You know, my friends will be looking for me. TRACER: I hope so. You and your friends and myself have all been contaminated. But we still have time for a cure. I've got to make contact with NASA. Damn it, I lost her! They're still here and their lights are on. I'm gonna ask him if we can borrow his car. You stay by the radio, all right? All right. Mr. Bodi! Mr. Bodi! Come on! Mr. Bodi! Come on. What did they say? They... [VOMITING] What is it, Damon? You all right, buddy? I can rig a fuel line with their car. Michael, don't go over there. [CHUCKLES] DOLL: Hello. My name is talking Tina. Hello. My name... [SCREAMS] SAMANTHA: You've had this thing on the whole time? I don't understand you. We will go to the motel. There should be a main switchboard there. Maybe that one is working. Come on, let's go. Get out of the car. No.I sad let's go. Get out of the car. We don't have much time. Let's go. Ow! SAMANTHA: You know, you're parked in a red zone. What's taking you so long? Okay. Try it now. [ENGINE CHUGGING] [ENGINE STARTS] Hurry up, get in! I got it. Don't worry about me. Damon, are you sure this thing's gonna work? Don't worry about me. I got it. I got it. Damon? We can go now. Let me go! If I let you go, I may not find you again. And you and your friends will die. You're crazy! Hello? Hello? Yes? Yes? Red Alpha alert. No. It's not a drill. Don't you understand? This is Dr. Borden Tracer. Zero-zero-nine-nine-one. No, I haven't notified the Spanish government. Don't you understand? There isn't time! [SCREAMS] Let me out of here! Help me out of here! [SQUIRMING NOISES] Please let me out of here! Please help me! [SCREAMS] TRACER: Come with me. You had to pick that room to hide in. SAMANTHA: It was the only one that wasn't locked. I've been trying to tell you. I hope Michael and Damon are all right. [MAN LAUGHING] You trust me now? Do I have a choice? [CLATTERING] Just wait here. Samantha! ...the man. I'm gonna kill you. Damon, no! [SCREAMS] Oh, God! You mean, he's not the one that kidnapped you? Yes. No. He's... Can I get up now? I've got something to show you. TRACER: That's the only road leading in and out of Duarte. The only road left. Look at that. There's no doubt in my mind. We've definitely entered the twilight zone. They're barricading us in. It will spread so fast. So far. The entire population of Europe will be wiped out in a matter of weeks. Yeah, but what's gonna happen to us? Damon, I don't believe you. He just said all of Europe will be wiped out. And you wanna know what's gonna happen to us? Bitch. Sorry. What sort of disease could cause this? It's not a disease. It's an alien. It centers itself in the stomach. It uses the DNA structure of the host like a supermarket. Picking and choosing the traits it needs to develop itself. The victims being invaded have approximately 48 hours before they become psychopathic. Then, the alien becomes fully developed. And is violently expelled. Expelled. Really? I need one of those canisters from the NASA research center for the antidote. If we don't get it soon, it will be too late. Well, let's say we get the antidote. How are we gonna get out of here? Weapons. We need weapons. Lots of weapons. DAMON: Stop here! MICHAEL: Why here?I saw this place earlier. I've got a good feeling about it. DOLL: Hello, my name is talking Tina. SAMANTHA: Damon, what was it? I was just attacked by a flying baby doll. Well, what now? DAMON: I'm impressed. MICHAEL: Damon, take a look. I think the rear of the camper is barely sticking out. DAMON: Yeah. Nice job, Michael. This should hold us. I'll prepare the serum here. I've got to go back to the research center and find the Sky-lab canister. Look, I'll go and you stay here. You can't do it. I can run the 100 in 10 flat. What can you do it in? Let him go. I do need the time to prepare. You need this. There are five descending levels to the research center. Damon, I gotta go. So, that's your weapon?It's better than nothing. Well, take it. No, those things scare me.Scare you? We had target practice everyday when we were training for Vietnam. We were in the sixth grade and we shot Red Rider BB guns. It's the same principle. Listen, take care of yourself. Okay? Yeah. Michael. Please take this. It's Tracer's. You wouldn't try anything stupid? You'd better get back in the RV, hon. Hon? See you. I think they make a cute couple. Come on. Give me a break. Does anybody tell her it was me that fixed the RV? No. But old Mikey is the kind of a guy that I mould my life after. There's something you should know, Samantha. It was Damon who fixed the camper. Hey, it's no big deal. He'll be all right, won't he? MICHAEL: ♪ I love a girl named Samantha ♪ Oh, yeah I see you. Well, here I am, Mr. Brave. Who is most macho? Charles Bronson, Clint Eastwood or you? [LAUGHS] Okay, play. You is most macho. [INAUDIBLE] [ENGINE SPUTTERING] Kiddo.Oh, hi. You know, I really appreciate you fixing the RV and coming after me and all. You really think we would've left you out there by yourself? Hey, come here. I'm worried about him, too, you know. Ever since kindergarten, we've been competing. I was Greater Los Angeles champ, and Michael... Old Mikey... He was Hollywood's number one driver. Everything from tricycles to Jeeps, dune buggies, even a race car or two. Hey, you'd better not steal him away from me. I don't know what I'd do without him. You couldn't have picked a nicer guy. Well, I take that back. There's probably just one who's a little bit better. You've both been such gentlemen. Yeah, what can I say? You know, Sam, everything that Michael knows, he learned from me. So actually, you've fallen in love with my style, not his. I hope it doesn't affect you two in the future. I mean, your babies. [LAUGHS] Shit! God, it's quiet out there. I wonder what they're doing. Killing each other. [SHRIEKS] [SQUIRMING NOISES] [SCREECHING] [SQUIRMING NOISES] [SCREECHING] [MICHAEL SCREAMING] Get off of me! [GRUNTING] [SCREECHING] You can't climb up the ladder, can you, you little shit? [SQUIRMING NOISES] Oh, shit! [GUN FIRES] What? AUTOMATED VOICE: The NASA research center has entered into emergency destruct mode. You have T minus 60 seconds to evacuate. [ALARM SOUNDING] The NASA research center has entered into emergency destruct mode. You have T minus 30 seconds to evacuate. No! I've did it! I've got it! I've got the canister. I did it! I've got it! I got the canister! I got it! I gotta get out of here! I did it! I got it! Samantha, what's your blood type? "O" positive. Damon? "N" positive. There's no "N" positive, Damon. Oh. "O." Now, Damon, give Samantha your rifle and come over here so I can take a sample of your blood. Help yourself, professor. Ouch. [SHRIEKS] [TIRES SCREECHING] What's wrong? What was it, Damon? Whatever it was, it's not there now. Where's Michael? He said it wouldn't take long. MICHAEL: Oh, no. Not you again. Okay, let's see if Hollywood's number one driver can't lose one lousy Fiat. One incredibly souped up Fiat. That was Mikey! He's got one Fiat on his tail. Come on, Mikey, you can lose him! Mikey happens to be Hollywood's number one driver. Slime bucket. Here he comes again. Does he have the canister? Can you see? DAMON: He's got his thumbs up.SAMANTHA: Yeah! He's got it. Yeah! All right! Hey, daredevil woman. You wanna do this right, let's take our clothes off. [SHOUTING] Now, take a fast look at what Greater Los Angeles calls the champ. Hey, Hollywood. Oh, man, you were looking good out there, buddy. I knew you could do it. Now, Damon, grab the canister. I need your help. You've got blood on your leg. I'm not sure you should touch me. This stuff is pretty deadly. Really? Yeah. Tracer's got an antidote. That's true. It would've been real bad for me down there in that research center, whole place on self destruct. I lost the card. I couldn't get out. How did you get out? I did what any red-blooded American hero would do. Climbed up the elevator shaft. Wonderful. Thanks. And that Fiat chasing me, I think I handled him pretty good. Hollywood's number one driver. You know that? Of course, Damon. All of Greater Los Angeles champ. Uh-huh. That was very affectionate. I know. I'm glad you know so much. [CAR HORN HONKS] How sweet. We haven't got all night. Come on. [SAMANTHA AND MICHAEL BOOING] The antidote will work just like the old tetanus shot which initially was just a horse serum. Let's use myself as an example of the horse. Be careful. TRACER: Years ago, the horse was injected with the purest strain of tetanus. The alien developed so rapidly that it only takes about 20 seconds for the necessary antibodies to develop in their bloodstream. Blood is taken from the horse and the serum is made, which is then injected into the patient. Damon, you first. I hate this sort of thing. Come on. TRACER: That should do it. Where's yours? [WHOOSHING] SAMANTHA: What was that? F-14s. F-14s carrying napalm. Is that why you needed to make that call? Saturation napalm bombing, right? Listen, you still have time. Oh, God. Your nose. Hey, wait!Damon! Don't go out there! Well, what do you think happens to the horse after he's injected with tetanus? Tracer! You could've told us, Tracer. Tracer, it's not too late. We can get you to a hospital. Tracer? You know what I'll do to you if you don't get of here! Tracer, it's not too late. Those jets are going to destroy this town. Come with us. Please. Do you think I can come with you? Yes, of course you can. We wouldn't leave you here. No, don't leave without me. Don't leave me alone!Tracer, get out of the street. Don't leave me here. Tracer! Run! No! Damon! Come on, let's get out of here! God damn it! I've had enough of this bullshit. We're getting the hell out of here. Damon, it's the gas truck! MICHAEL: Damon, what are you doing? Be careful! Damon!What? Yeah, let's see that son of a bitch try that again. [CLICKS] Shit! Damon? Hold on, we're going through! Don't wait for me! Just one tire. That's all I want. Damon, strap yourself in! Just one... Damon! [WHOOPS] Damon? I love the smell of napalm in the morning! [LAUGHING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] SAMANTHA: It's Telly. There's a small town called Chinchon about 20 kilometers from here that Samantha claims is famous for having the first bullfight in Spain. Give me that. Oh, God. Oh, no. [GRUNTS] Michael! Help me! Help! Michael! Damon! What a nightmare! Sam, are you all right? SAMANTHA: Guys, get it off! What the hell is that? MICHAEL: It's the same thing I saw down at the research center. I don't believe it! Take it off! MICHAEL: Come on, Damon. Go! Go, Damon. Put it in drive. Let's get out of here! SAMANTHA: Damon!Hurry, it's coming! [ENGINE SPUTTERING] Damon! MICHAEL: Go, go! How much longer to Madrid? Not long. It's all over now. I'll say. [CHUCKLES] [LAUGHING] [SQUIRMING NOISES]
