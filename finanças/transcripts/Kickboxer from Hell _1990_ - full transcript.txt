(spooky percussive instrumental music) (woman screams and gasps) (exciting instrumental music) (woman shouts and gasps) (exciting instrumental music) (banging) (discordant instrumental music) (birds tweet) (discordant instrumental music) (thudding) (groaning) Can't you do better? Okay. Again! (knuckles crack) (thuds and grunts) (shouting) (thuds and grunts) Help me, help me! You've got to help me! What's the matter? (percussive instrumental music) Get lost, asshole. Be clever and don't fuck with us. I'm not gonna leave this lady behind with you. You get lost, asshole! Is that clear? You think you can fight. I'll teach you a lesson and I don't even need this. (suspenseful instrumental music) (shouting) (thuds and grunts) (shouting) (thuds and grunts) (groaning) (thudding and groaning) No! Stop! Leave him for Lucifer. (poppy instrumental music) Okay, that's great. Look this way, hold it right there. Okay. Everyone ready? (poppy instrumental music) [Man In Dark Jacket] Take care of Aileen, Robert. I'm sure that you two will have a very happy life together. [Woman In Grey] Marriages are made in heaven. Aileen changed her direction of life just for you, Robert. I know she's given up a lot for me. You know, Peter, I love your sister even more than I love myself. [Child] When will you be back, Auntie? [Aileen] In only five days. [Child] I can hardly wait. That's a good guy. Hey, a five day honeymoon is short, but sweet. Right. (Chuckling) (plane roars) (poppy instrumental music) Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Who are they, why do they wanna kill you? They're Devil's Disciples. Devil's Disciples. Huh. You don't believe me! Yeah, yeah I do. Tell me, why are they after you. It's a long story. I'm a nun actually. But my partner and I were working undercover against Lucifer. But she, I mean my partner Aileen, gave up in the middle of it all. It led to my identity being exposed. That's still not enough of an excuse for them to kill you. They wanna sacrifice me to Lucifer! Oh, that's terrible. Hmm. I suggest you'd better leave here and go as far away as possible, huh? I can't! I've got to stay around because Aileen's also their target. So? Tell her to leave with you. She won't go. She just got married. She wants to settle down and stay here, and she doesn't want her husband to know about it. Okay then, tell me where the lunatics are. I'll go and finish them off. No, violence against violence is not a good resolution. All right. I'm out of it altogether. Don't think that I'm just a three year old and I believe in fairytales like this. Anyhow, I've got to prepare for the kickboxing tournament. And I've got no time to fool around with you, young lady. (somber instrumental music) - Robert, darling. - Hmm? [Aileen] I'm sure my decision to give up the calling and be with you is right. I've never been happier. I'm so glad. I'm sure, too. (waves crash) (somber instrumental music) (water gurgling) (Robert grunts) (cat meows) Robert, wake up! I hear a strange sound. What? Listen, there! I don't hear a sound. (cat howls) (Aileen gasps) (eerie instrumental music) (cat meows) (eerie instrumental music) You! (cat meows) (eerie instrumental music) (cat howls) (eerie instrumental music) Shoo! (cat howls) (tense instrumental music) (cat meows) (cat howls) (Robert grunts) (eerie instrumental music) [Old Woman] So you've returned. Welcome home, sir. (quietly dramatic instrumental music) Hello, sir. I've brought your wedding photos. Oh, thank you. I, uh, thought you might like to check them all. Why didn't you just send them by mail? Well, I, uh, just, uh... Let's see. They're all here. Please, have a look, as you wish. (tense instrumental music) What happened? Your camera is no good! What's that? Well, I don't really know. I want an explanation. How could every photo come out like that? Uh, I'm not sure myself, really. The film was fresh, and we developed it carefully. Actually, we were surprised as well. - Give me the negatives. - Sure. (tense instrumental music) You say the film was brand new. What's wrong with you? Why are they all smeared then? [Photographer] Uh, I'm sorry, I'll have to look into it further. And what about us? That's all we've got to remember our wedding with. [Photographer] I'm so sorry. So strange. The face in each picture is, is the same. They spoiled the negatives, that's all. Looks like your deceased wife. Huh? Don't be silly. It was just some mistake, something wrong with the developing process. They used the wrong setting. (eerie instrumental music) (clock ticks) (eerie instrumental music) (clock ticks) (dramatic instrumental music) (screaming) (eerie instrumental music) What is it? Aileen! What's wrong? It's the clock. Something's wrong! What's wrong with it? I was bothered by the ticking sound. I locked the pin and it was not going! That clock hasn't worked in over five years. I think you must be tired. Now, you come back to bed and sleep. Come on. (moody instrumental music) (percussive instrumental music) I told you to bring back the girl. What do you have for me now? (swirling instrumental music) Why, you wimps have let me down. One of you has to be punished. [Man On Left] He is the one who fucked up. He should be punished. Bullshit, you liar! Don't believe him, my master. You son of a bitch. I'm telling the truth. You were scared shitless when you fought that asshole. Fuck you, you lousy liar! I'll sting your motherfucking ass! [Acolyte] Don't believe him, master. Don't believe him! Shut up! I'll give you a chance to prove your loyalty. You two fight each other to the death. Then the winner will continue to be my servant. Now, go on and get in the ring. And kill for Lucifer. (brooding instrumental music) (knuckles crack) (thuds and grunts) (groaning) (thuds and grunts) (thunderous smack) (groaning) (chuckles) (groaning) (shouting) (thuds and grunts) I got him! I got him, he's not getting up! Good, good, my son, very good. You're a good fighter. I'll let you receive the glory of being the sacrifice to Satan. No, master! (percussive instrumental music) No! You have to keep your promise. Don't, don't! (percussive instrumental music) (shouting) (thuds and grunts) (percussive instrumental music) (shouting) (thuds and grunts) (groaning) Get up, come on. Get up! (percussive instrumental music) (thuds and grunts) (screaming) (shouting) (laughing) (birds tweet) Is anyone home? Hello, can you hear me? Oh, how do you do? Oh. Are you Mrs. Ho? Mm. [Woman] I understand you're looking for a maid. This way. This will be your room. I'll show you the kitchen. (clock ticks) (maid humming) [Maid] Huh? (dramatic instrumental music) Hey, so you're the new maid here, right? Yeah, I arrived today. Who are you? - Oh, I'm a guest. - Sorry, I didn't know that you were here. (eerie instrumental music) I'm very thirsty. (dramatic, eerie instrumental music) Could I have something to drink? Yeah. (eerie instrumental music) Good morning. Morning. Why are you setting another place? This is for your lady guest. [Aileen] Guest? Oh yes, I saw her last night. [Aileen] Who did you see? I don't know who she is. She said she was your guest. I saw her last night when I went into the bathroom. [Aileen] Huh? I didn't know someone was already in there when I went to take a bath last night. She was nice to me and didn't seem to mind the intrusion at all. She said hello to me. Later, when I was in the kitchen, she asked me for a drink. I poured her a glass of soda, but when I turned back, she'd gone. It was quite late at night, so I assumed she was spending the night here. Then this morning... That's all, take it away. Just forget it. (tense instrumental music) (wind whistling) (banging) (eerie instrumental music) Madam, is that you in there? (eerie instrumental music) (knocking) Madam, are you taking a bath? (eerie instrumental music) (gasps) (banging) (tense instrumental music) Hi. Want some watermelon? (screaming) (laughing) (tense instrumental music) I'm sorry, Mrs. Ho. I gotta resign. (gasping) (tense instrumental music) Mrs. Ho. Mrs. Ho! (clock ticks) We have visitors. Who are they? Real estate agents. They want to take some photographs of the house, and grounds, too. They said that Mr. Ho had hired them. Tell them to do as they want. (percussive instrumental music) Yes, that's a good angle. (percussive instrumental music) Now let's get the, uh, roof line framed in the trees. It'll look great. (percussive instrumental music) Now one of the garden, uh, from about here. Yes. (percussive instrumental music) (grunting) Sophia, I'm just too weak to help you. My brother Shaun, he can help you. He's a good fighter, and he's very strong as well. But he couldn't care less. All he cares for is his own boxing tournament. Besides, I'm not too impressed with his horrible violent trend. Sophia, you can't blame him. Everybody is selfish. Everyone has his dreams. The boxing tournament is very important to him. Kickboxing is his life, you understand? His career. Do you know why the world has become such a wicked place? It's because of people like your brother, people who only care about themselves, who want to achieve their own goals by whatever means they can. Isn't that the world created by your God? Why doesn't he find a solution for them? Sophia, listen, let me talk to my brother. He has a good heart. I think he will help. I really hope so. (grunting) Shaun, I have to talk to you. Give me a break! You know how important this tournament is to me. And you, you get away from this crazy nun. You're my only family. I don't want anything to happen to you. Shaun, listen to me, please. Her life is threatened by the devil. What if she told us is true? Shaun, then we have to help her. If it's true, then don't go looking for trouble, all right, unless you're strong enough. (screaming) Help her, help her for God's sake! Shaun, you have to help her. [Shaun] Okay. (exciting instrumental music) Over there! Yeah! (exciting instrumental music) [Sophia] Help me, help! Help, please, help! Help me! (exciting instrumental music) Help! Help me! Help me! Help! Help, help me! Help! Help me, help me! Help, help me! Help me! - Huh? - Help me! (shouting) (grunts and thuds) (dramatic instrumental music) You lookin' for me? You know, we've got the girl. (grunts and thuds) (groaning) (shouting) (thunderous smack) (groaning) (tense instrumental music) (gagging) (blood splatters) (discordant instrumental music) (pounding instrumental music) Oh my God, there he is. There's something wrong. Let's go! (pounding instrumental music) Huh? Oh heavenly Father, please (speaker fades out into pulsing music). Come on! (clock ticks) (dramatic instrumental music) (screaming) (tense instrumental music) [Robert] Aileen! Aileen! What's wrong? What's the matter, Aileen? Ghost, a ghost. I saw her in the mirror! I saw her! [Robert] Aileen. It's all, it's all right. Aileen. (tense instrumental music) (clock ticks) (tinkling instrumental music) I want the key to that room. No, madam, I can't. I said give it to me. (tense instrumental music) (cat meows) (gasping) (tense instrumental music) (cat howls) (tense instrumental music) (rattling) (gasping) (exciting instrumental music) (shouting) (exciting instrumental music) (shouting) Help! (exciting instrumental music) (shouting) (exciting instrumental music) Help! Help! Somebody! Aileen, what's wrong? Come here, quick! (exciting instrumental music) Robert, come quickly! (shouting) Aileen! Honey, what's going on? Aileen. - The dress. - There's no dress here. (gasping) Everything is all right. You must've been daydreaming. All right, let's go now, here. (dramatic instrumental music) Aileen. (clock ticks) Come on, get to bed early. I'll take a bath and join ya later. (clock ticks) (tinkling instrumental music) (dramatic, eerie instrumental music) (wind whistles) (spooky chanting) (eerie instrumental music) (wind whistles) (tense instrumental music) (gasping and shouting) (exciting instrumental music) (wind whistles) (screaming) (cackling) (wind whistles) Aileen? (tense instrumental music) Aileen. Aileen! Answer me. Aileen! Wake up. (eerie instrumental music) (gentle instrumental music) Don't worry, Mr. Ho. Mrs. Ho's delusions are merely due to nervous tension. She is only suffering from what we call neurasthenia. Even getting married or some such other change, a sudden change in her lifestyle, could cause these delusions. - Oh. - Just let her take some good rest and she'll recover soon. Don't you worry. Robert, I think you better cancel this trip. But I'm going to meet a very important client. I can't cancel it now. You look after Aileen, okay? (car revs) (tires squeal) Uh, a young lady will be coming here to see me at about four o'clock. Bring her in and I'll check her in. Certainly. Okay, I've still got a few hours to kill. Do you have any sights you'd recommend? Well, actually, anywhere around the hotel would be just fine. Oh, right, okay. (gentle instrumental music) Mary. You're here early. (percussive instrumental music) What the hell is she doin' up there? (percussive instrumental music) She's gone. (surf crashes) (screaming) (splashing) (laughing) Fuck! (exciting instrumental music) - Where did you go, huh? - Lookin' for you. Well look no further, I'm right here and ready for anything. (soft grunts) I'll go take a bath. (chuckles) (dramatic instrumental music) (shouting) (softly moaning) [Robert] Mary! (dramatic instrumental music) (screaming) (dramatic instrumental music) Oh. Sit down, please. We are sorry that we had to trouble you. All right now, we did find her diary. There are numerous entries referring to suicide. And the examination of the forensic pathologist does bear this out. We have concluded that you were in no way responsible for her death. Hey, Pa. Hey, Pa. (gentle snoring) Pa! Pa! I want to sleep with Auntie Aileen. What's that? I haven't seen her in a long time, and she doesn't snore. Okay. (gentle snoring) [Boy] Auntie Aileen, can I sleep in here with you, huh? [Aileen] Sure, come on. (boy giggles) I thought you were already sleeping. Mm mm. Sweet dreams. [Boy] Good night. (dramatic instrumental music) [Priest] May the power of Lucifer fill your mind and body. May the power of Lucifer fill your mind and body. May the power of Lucifer fill your mind and body. May the power of Lucifer fill your mind and body. May the power of Lucifer fill your mind and body. May the power of Lucifer fill your mind and body. (chuckling) (clock ticks) (dramatic instrumental music) (clock tolls) (tense instrumental music) (gasping) (tense instrumental music) (screaming) [Boy] No! (Screams) Papa, Papa! (Screams) Papa! Papa! Aileen, Aileen, what are you doing? (boy cries) (shouting) Get off! Run, Sonny, get away! (shouting and groaning) Aileen, what are you doing? (growling and moaning) Aileen! Aileen! (grunting) Take it easy! It's all right, easy. Easy! (grunting) Aileen, calm down. What's wrong? Aileen! It's all right, don't worry, it's all right! (Aileen moans) (dramatic instrumental music) (birds tweet) [Robert] What am I gonna do? Even the doctor doesn't really know what's wrong with her. It's no ordinary illness. - Yeah, I know what you mean. - And it's pretty serious you know. Yeah, that's right. And the doctor said the symptoms could recur at any time. Is it possible that she's possessed? Possessed? Yeah, evil spirits and demons and all that. You know, you better watch her carefully. (birds tweet) Jimmy, this is Shaun. He's been helping me with my investigation. The last time, you refused to tell me how to conquer Lucifer. But this time, you must help us! Lucifer is out for us, and we must finish him off first! - Dangerous business. - Hey, pal! Let me tell you something. The most dangerous thing is to sit here and do nothing, waiting for the enemy to come and get us. Now tell me how you get rid of Lucifer. Sure, if you're determined to do so, I'll show you how. I'll give you a map, which will show you the way to Lucifer's den. But you can't defeat Lucifer himself by using physical violence alone. Lucifer has stored his life force in some containers. Only by destroying those containers can Lucifer be exterminated once and for all. (sighs) Ah, Mr. Ho, I've been trying to contact you. [Robert] What's up? Uh, you remember, two weeks ago, you asked me to try and find a buyer for your house? Yes. Let's sit down and talk. Uh, Mr. Ho, I was able to find you an interested buyer. He was happy with the location and the size. He even felt the price was right. Yeah? But, when he saw the pictures, he got cold feet and pulled out of the deal. Why would he withdraw his offer? Ah, Mr. Ho, you better take a look at the pictures yourself now. I think you'll see why the man pulled out. These pictures are terrible! [Agent] What? No wonder the buyer isn't interested. It's not our fault. We only shot whatever was there. Don't you try to excuse yourselves from your responsibility! Well my partner's a renowned photographer. He knows how to take a picture. - Get out. - How's that? I know all your tricks. You just wanna get the price down. Now get out. I've never been spoken to like this in all my years in business. Let's go, come on. Huh! Philistine. (clock ticks) (gentle instrumental music) What are you thinking? Aileen, I'm so worried about your health. I'm trying to figure out how I can help you. Don't worry, I feel fine now. Next weekend, let's take a trip together so we can relax. (gentle instrumental music) (roaring) (wind whistles) What's the matter? (wind whistles) Oh, nothing. (wind whistles) (roaring) (wind whistles) (dramatic instrumental music) Robert, what's wrong? (eerie instrumental music) What's wrong with you? Robert! Robert! - Oh, Peter, how are you? - Hello. Sit down. Over there. This is Miss Young. She took care of Robert's ex-wife from the time she was born until the day she died. I see. Miss Young, do you think you can tell me something about the way she died. Tell me everything that you can remember. Actually, her death was quite unexpected. She was so healthy, full of life, and optimistic. But one night last summer, she went to bed as usual. Next morning, she was dead and gone. (mournful instrumental music) Here's madam's shroud. Put it over there. Won't you let me put it on her? [Robert] Don't bother me! Leave me alone. (mournful instrumental music) What about the funeral? Was there something strange? Only Mr. Ho and I were there. He forbade anyone to look at her body. Mistress! (Weeps) Mistress! (Cries) Why did you leave the world so soon? Mistress. (Cries) You were so young! Mistress! (Cries) (mournful instrumental music) (cat meows) (eerie instrumental music) [Robert] Come now. You'll cry your eyes out. Let's go. (mournful instrumental music) She was still such a pretty and young girl. I never knew she was suffering from any illness. I, I still don't know what she died of, really. Can you tell me where her body was buried? [Miss Young] She's buried in the public cemetery. (dramatic instrumental music) We are gathered together, and we call upon the spirit of Mrs. Lisa Ho, who died on the 14th day of July, last year. We call upon her to cross back over the great divide and communicate with us living things for only a little while. Know that we are your friends and we have absolutely no intention of doing any harm at all to your spirit. If you are bearing any grudge or have anything to tell us, please do so now. We'll do anything we can to help your soul rest in peace. We only ask that you talk to us and tell us what you want. (eerie instrumental music) We will do our best to help you. Talk to us. Talk to us. (Miss Young whimpering) Tell us who you are. My name is, my name is Lisa, wife of Robert Ho. Tell us now exactly how you died last summer. I, I was killed. Robert killed me! So do you mean that you were murdered? I was murdered, yes, I was murdered. He beat me, and he beat me again! And then he strangled me. And then he buried my body in the garden. I can never, never rest in peace. I can't rest in peace, help me! Help me, help me, help me now, I beg you! Help my soul! I can't rest in peace in that cursed soil, no! Please, please help me, please help me rest in peace! Oh, please! Master, Shaun always gets in our way. I wanna teach him a lesson. Ah! He's a damned good fighter. Yeah, yeah, he is good. But I'm better. You just give me a chance. I'll show you who's the best fighter. Good, good, I leave him to you. And remember, now you don't let me down. I won't, I never will. (birds tweet) (tinkling instrumental music) (moody instrumental music) Robert! (door slams) Tell me honestly, do you really love me? You used to be so good, Robert. You did love me. Now I don't know. You've completely changed. It seems like you're totally indifferent to me. I have to know why you're acting so cold these days. Tell me the truth! Are you having a secret affair with another woman? Hmm, I'm getting tired of your damn nonsense. You keep naggin' me day and night. You're driving me crazy. I'll keep on nagging, too, until you talk to me. I'm your wife and I have a right to know what my husband is doing, don't I? Quiet down! I won't quiet down! I realize now why you really married me. You don't care about love, you just want my money. (thundering smack) (groaning) Oh, now you're showing your true colors! Come on, beat me! Beat me to death if you dare! Come on, beat me! (shouting and grunting) I won't spare you. If I die, I won't let you live! Beat me, come on! (moaning) Ah, come on! (moaning) (gagging) (tense instrumental music) (droning instrumental music) (percussive instrumental music) (birds tweet) I'll take care of Lucifer's two fucking servants. You wait here, I'll be back. [Sophia] Okay, you take care. (marching instrumental music) I've waited a long time for you. (tense instrumental music) (shouting) (thudding) (shouting) (tense instrumental music) (thuds and grunts) (echoing smack) (groaning) (screaming) (pulsing instrumental music) (gasping) (thuds and grunts) Come on. Come on. Come on. Yeah, come on. How was it, painful? (thudding) (thuds and grunts) I don't know what pain is. But you do, huh? (thuds and grunts) (dramatic instrumental music) (thudding) (groaning) (dramatic instrumental music) [Satanist Voiceover] We're gonna get you, too. Fuck! (thunder rolls) (rain patters) I don't believe what that old girl said. (creaking) Easy. (thunder rolls) (creaking) There's no corpse in the coffin. (wind moans) (thunder rolls) (tense instrumental music) (cracking) (moaning) (percussive instrumental music) (eerie instrumental music) (grunting) (tense instrumental music) Robert! (pulsing instrumental music) - There. - Huh? (pulsing instrumental music) (car engine grinds) Robert. You can't get away. I've called the police, and they'll be coming for you soon. (insects chirp) You'll pay for what you've done. Don't deny it, we know everything. (fleshy thunks) (groaning) (pounding instrumental music) (cackling) (eerie instrumental music) (wind whistles) (cackling) (wind whistles) [Lucy] Robert! Come to me. Here. Come. (siren wails) (wind whistles) (Robert whimpers) (dramatic instrumental music) (growling) (whimpering) (cackling) (blooping ambient music) (water splashes) (cackling) (growling) (eerie instrumental music) [Robert] (whimpers) No! (Whimpers) No, Lisa! I'm sorry! No! (growling) (grunting) (brooding ambient music) (Robert groans) (brooding ambient music) Shaun! Shaun! Stop! Let the girl go! [Sophia] Help me, Shaun! This is between me and you now. You'll pay for my brother! She's ours. She knows too much. - Shaun! - I know as much as she does. Why don't you kill me first, huh? No! (Whimpers) (laughs) How I love to hear that sound. (screaming) Help me, help me! (laughs) I love to hear her squealing. (Laughs) (Sophia shouts) (laughing) (screaming) (laughing) Let her go! Sure. But fight me first. Show time, it's show time! (Laughs) (tense instrumental music) (hammers clink) (tense instrumental music) (hammers clink) (tense instrumental music) Do you wanna play a little game with me? Real nice, huh? (tense instrumental music) (hammers clack) (grunting) (groaning) (skull shatters) (moaning) (gasping) You fool! (tense instrumental music) (thuds and grunts) This game is fun, huh? (shouting) (thuds and grunts) (groaning) (tense instrumental music) I've played your game. Now you play mine. Ready? (knuckles crack) (thuds and grunts) (laughing) (fleshy smack) (groaning) [Satanist] Come on, get up, come on! Get up, chicken. Get up! (shouting) (thuds and grunts) (moaning) (thuds and grunts) (groaning) (neck cracks) (groaning) (thudding) (grunting) (tense instrumental music) (thudding) (shouting) (thuds and grunts) (shouting) (neck cracks) (dark instrumental music) You've still lost! I still got the girl! Break all the skulls, Shaun, and his power will be gone! (Screams) (shouting) (eerie instrumental music) Wait! Wait! I have the power to grant you anything you wish if you join me. What do you want? Wealth? Power? The world! There's nothing I want except revenge! (tense instrumental music) Rise, I command you to rise. By the power of Satan. I command you. You should never have killed my brother! (tense instrumental music) This is for him! Now! Join me. Come on and join me. Fuck you! Shaun! Behind you! (crashing) (shouting) Idiot. Idiot. (chains rattle) (brooding ambient music)
