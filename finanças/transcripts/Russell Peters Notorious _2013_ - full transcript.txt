[AUDIENCE CHEERING] [AUDIENCE CONTINUES CHEERING] Thank you! All right! Fucking Sydney! [AUDIENCE CHEERING] Give it up for Starting From Scratch and DJ Spinbad, ladies and gentlemen. Just so you guys know, that's actually what DJs are supposed to do. You see how they were DJ'ing and they weren't looking at you? Because they were fucking DJ'ing. I know a lot of you spend money to go see these so-called "DJs" that stand there in big arenas like this and their arms are in the air. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] They better be DJ'ing with their dick right now, that's all I'm saying. Because if your arms are in the air, who the fuck is playing the music? That's like you spending money to come see me and then I put on a DVD and go: [AUDIENCE LAUGHING AND APPLAUDING] Stand there making hand hearts. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING AND RUSSELL CHUCKLING] Good to be back here. How are you, buddy? I can't tell if you're white or not. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] It's not that easy anymore, you know? Back in the day when you see a white person, you knew they were white immediately. When I was a kid, if I saw a white person, I didn't have to ask. I was, "You white?" They'd be like, "What else would I be?" But now you need to confirm. What are you, sir? Are you white? Yes. Even you hesitated. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You had to go through your own lineage. You were like, "I'm a-- [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Apparently, I am. Yes." Because you're not regular white. You got, like, hairy immigrant arms, you know what I mean? Like-- It's not like-- Get a shot of those. You get those? You're missing the arm cue, it's right-- Oh, look at that. Jesus, that is-- That's-- That's not proper white, buddy. I don't know, that's... That's Italian or Greek or something. I don't know what's going on there. Where are your parents from? UK. UK. Okay, so-- Yeah, that's pretty white. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] That, in fact, is the benchmark. That-- [AUDIENCE LAUGHING AND RUSSELL CHUCKLING] You are a hairy-- One hairy Englishman, I'll tell you that. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the hair of an Englishman. Ha-ha-ha. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [RUSSELL GROANS] You know why you gotta ask nowadays? I was in Florida-- You guys ever go to Florida, in the U.S.? If you go to Florida, everybody in Florida looks like everybody in this room until they open their mouth. Spanish flies right out of their mouth, like-- Not like a little bit of Spanish, like, you could tell that's all their thoughts, everything they do is in Spanish. Know how you could tell? When you say hello to them, you can see your hello enter their head. You're like, "Hello." And you see it go, "Hello equals hola. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Reply with 'hello.'" [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And you know that their "hello" started with a J. That's the best part, you know. "Hello." It's not just a greeting, it's my favorite dessert. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] It sucks for me. I like the Spanish language, but if you go to a place where all they do is speak Spanish, and they should be speaking English, it gets annoying. Because they see the brown skin, they just assume something's going on. Everywhere I go in Florida, they're like: [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Listen up there, fucking Fernando, I don't wanna dance right now. First of all, we're at a gas station, this is really awkward. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] When I told the guy, I go-- I'm a-- I go, "Oh, I don't speak Spanish," he goes: "What kind of fucking Latino don't speak Spanish?" [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] When I told the guy I wasn't Latino, he reacted like a guy who bought a hooker and found out it was a guy. You know what I mean? Like-- "Oh, my God. No, no, I'm not Latino." "What the fuck are you?" [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Pointed at my dick when he did it. Just, "What the fuck is that?" [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I like Spanish, it just gets annoying when everybody's speaking it to you. Everywhere you go: [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] I got annoyed. I was getting fed up. I walked into a store, I saw an Indian guy with a turban, I got all excited. I was like, "Thank God, my people." I go, "How you doing, man?" He goes, "Hola." I'm like, "Oh, for fuck's sakes, man." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING AND APPLAUDING] You can't speak Spanish with Indian head motions. It doesn't work like that. [SPEAKS IN SPANISH WITH INDIAN ACCENT] [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I've been traveling a lot on this tour, that's the fun thing about being on the road is going to countries I'd never been to. I... I was in Thailand. I know a lot of you have been to Thailand. It's not far from here. I like how a lot of you don't wanna admit you've been to Thailand because you're fucking perverts, that's why. [ALL LAUGHING] Thailand's great. When I go to a country I've never been to, I like to experience what they're famous for. Not ladyboys, you filthy pirates, all right? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I was in Bangkok. Ha, ha. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You know what's funny about Bangkok? It doesn't matter how old you get. When you hear Bangkok, you'll giggle, every time. Forty-two years old, I'm like, "Bangkok." He-he-he. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Because you start thinking about the origin of names, right? Trying to figure out how they came up with that name. They were having a meeting in Thailand, they were: "We need a name for the city. Okay, quick lunch break, we come back." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [THUDDING THEN RUSSELL GROANS] [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] "What happened?" "Oh, I bang cock." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [VOCALIZES] Makes you wonder how they came up with the name for the island of Phuket. Know what I mean? "What do you wanna call that island?" "I don't know, fuck it, whatever. Just..." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I went to-- When I was in Bangkok, I wanted to-- I went for a Thai massage, that's what else they're famous for. Just so you know, if you go to Thailand, you want a Thai massage, just say you want a massage, not a Thai massage because they understand that it's already Thailand. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] But I didn't know. One of my friends was telling me about the Thai massages. It's actually customary over there for the lady giving you the massage to-- [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Not shoot dice. I mean-- [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Finish you off. And I was like, "Well, all right." And I-- Just out of curiosity, I was like, "Why do they do that?" Not that I'm opposed to it, I just wanna know why. And he goes: "Oh, because, you know, they give you this great massage and you're relaxed all over, your whole body, except for dead center, you're stiff." And then, he was like, "Well, when is a man most relaxed? Right after brrt." Ah. Right? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And then you add a great massage on to that, and you're just fucking Jell-O when you leave. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You can tell who's had a massage. Everybody walking in the streets of Bangkok: [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] "Is he hammered?" "No, he had a great massage." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] So I was like, "All right, I'll try it out." So I went for my massage, and just my luck-- I'm not making this up. Just my luck, when I was there, they had just passed a law saying that these women weren't allowed to: They were no longer allowed to finish you off with their hands. They weren't gonna start blowing everybody. It's not that kind of party. You know what I mean? Because even when they do finish you off with their hands, it's not done like, you know, outside of Thailand, like-- Here it'll be considered dirty. Like, "Hey, you wanna go to rub 'n' tug?" Ah. You know, it's like-- It always has that gross undertone to it. Like, you go to a rub 'n' tug, and the lady is talking shit to you. "Oh, so big," you know, and-- And she's taking her time and, you know... Not over there. It has nothing to do with sexuality. It's just like the-- You know, to relax you. So they've got it down to, like, two pumps, like, ding, ding, "Get out." You know what I mean? Like... They don't care how big, how small. They're like, ding, ding, "Get out." You know what I mean? So... So I'm trying to figure out what's gonna happen when I go for my massage. I go, "What happens?" He goes, "You're gonna find out," and I go, "All right." I go, "Will they still finish me off?" "Probably, but I don't know how." I go, "All right, great." So I go for my massage, this cute little Thai lady, she gives me this great massage. Down my back, down my legs. Down my feet, up my legs, up my chest. And then she gets to my hog. And I know something's gonna happen, right, but I don't know what. So I just tilt my head back and relax, right? And I feel a wonderful sensation on my wiener. And I'm thinking maybe she's doing the old-- You know, like, the elbow crease. I don't know, like-- I say "the old" like it's a move or something, but like-- I mean, I've never had a girl go, "You like that?" I don't know, right? I'm just saying. I'm thinking she's doing it with her feet, which I like. Know what I mean? I like women's feet. That works for me, right? So I'm like... I feel this great sensation. So my curious side wants to see what's happening. So I look up, and I swear to God she's doing this: [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] She's giving me the best wrist job I've ever had in my life. [ALL LAUGHING] Like, I didn't know you could do that with a wrist. I went back to my hotel room that night because it felt so good I-- I thought I'd give it a shot, you know? I was sitting at the edge of my bed, I'm like, "All right." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Just a note, fellas. If you're gonna try this tonight, take your watch off. That's all I'm saying. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Don't be the reason you have a Bangkok. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I was in the Middle East-- Where are the Arabs at tonight? Arabs? [AUDIENCE CHEERING] So that's a lot of Arabs. That's a dangerous amount. Uh... [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] What style of Arab are you guys here? MAN: Lebanese! "Lebanese." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] What the fuck is "Lebanese?" [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Is that some sort of hamburger topping that I don't know about? "Yeah, mate. How you doing? Let me get a-- [IN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT] Let me get a hamburger." That's my impression of you guys. I don't know. I don't know what to fucking-- It makes me laugh. "Hey, how you going, mate? No worries. Yeah, all right. Yeah, yeah, yeah." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Are you a particularly high-strung bunch of people or do you have to tell everybody, "No worries. Stop worrying, mate. All right-- Are you worried? There's no worries. All right." I feel like I should shove carrots in your mouth when you're talking to me. "Hey, how you going, mate?" [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [MIMICS CHURNING SOUND] "No worries." I'm not worried. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] "You shouldn't be." "Crickey." [RUSSELL CHUCKLING AND AUDIENCE LAUGHING] "Lebanese." "Let me get the ketchup and some 'lebanaise' on that, please." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] "What's 'lebanaise?' It's lemon and mayonnaise. It's a..." "Why don't they call it lemonaise?" "'Lebanaise' sounds better." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] My Lebanese friends, have you gone back to Beirut? Let me telling you something. I've partied all over the world, and by far, without trying to suck up to you guys, because I'm scared. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] But out of all the places I've been to in the world, Beirut parties like you've never seen before. Like, they-- [CHEERING] They literally party like there's no tomorrow. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] There could very well be over there. You know what I mean? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You've never seen chain-smoking like you-- Like, you go to Beirut, you see chain-smo-- To us, chain-smokers light up a cigarette, finish, and throw it on the ground and start another one. Lebanon? Three at a time. Literally, one, this hand, one, this hand, and like one of those fake blue ones for "safety." You know? I'm like, "Aren't you worried about getting cancer?" "I will never die of cancer." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] "Do you have the cure?" "The Yehudis will kill me before the cancer can. I don't have to worry about that, cancer. Cancer, AIDS, no disease will get me. Don't worry." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I know what the problem is in the Middle East. My Arab friends, listen up. Here's how to start change over there. Here's what the first problem is. Arab men will never say, "No. I don't know." They will never say no and they will never admit to not knowing something. It somehow emasculates an Arab man to not know something. It doesn't matter what it is. If he doesn't know, he'll make up a story and he will yell it at you. It doesn't matter what you ask him. It could be something as simple as: "Hey, do you know how to make a cake? Because I--" [IN ARABIC ACCENT] "Yes, of course. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Everybody knows how to make cake." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] "Really? Because I don't know how to make a cake. Could you show me?" [IN ARABIC ACCENT] "Yes." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Know how you could tell when an Arab guy's lying? He'll start his answer off with, "Okay." That's the fucking tip-off when you know he's lying. Right then. I'm like, "Really? I don't know how. How do you make a cake?" "Okay. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] First, you get cake. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Then you make it for 20 minutes. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Then you have cake." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] "Are you sure? Because I don't think that's how you make cake." "That is the only way to make cake! They have been making cake like that since the beginning of time!" I'm like, "All right, don't get crazy. I'm just asking." It's true. It doesn't matter what you ask him-- Whatever they-- If they don't know, they will make up a story. It's-- And this really happened to me last year. I was in Dubai. I was in Bloomingdales, the department store. The American department store. Clearly, there's a problem with the Jews and Arabs. So I'm in Bloomingdales, I'm looking to leave the store. I'm looking for an escalator. I see a security guy there. I walk up and I go, "Hi. Is there an escalator in here?" [IN ARABIC ACCENT] "Yes." "Do you know where it is?" "Yes, of course." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] "Do you think you could tell me where it is?" [IN ARABIC ACCENT] "Yes." [IN REGULAR TONE] "Fucking tell me then, right?" [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [IN ARABIC ACCENT] "Okay. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You go straight, then left, then right." I have no reason to doubt this guy. Go straight, then left, then right. So I go straight, I go left, and I go right into a wall. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] There's another guy working in that part of the store. I go, "Excuse me. Is there an escalator here?" He goes, "Do you see one?" I go, "No, I don't see one. That's why I'm asking." "Do you think maybe they put a wall in front of it?" [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I go, "I don't know what I think. That's why I'm asking you." "Why would you think there is an escalator on this wall?" [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] "Because some guy that worked here told me there was an escalator here." "Maybe he lied." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [IN REGULAR TONE] "Who the hell lies about an escalator?" [IN ARABIC ACCENT] "Apparently, that guy." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I go, "Is there an escalator in your store?" "Of course. How else you go up and down?" [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] "Do you know where it is?" "I work here." "So did that guy!" [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] "Can you tell me where it is?" "Yes." "Where the fuck is it?" [IN ARABIC ACCENT] "Okay. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You have to go back. Then go straight, then left, then right." I go, "No, no, no. That's how I ended up here. Those are the same directions." [IN ARABIC ACCENT] "Well, that's where it is." "Are you sure?" "Why would I lie?" "Why would that guy lie?" [IN ARABIC ACCENT] "That's his problem." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I go, "Okay, thank you." So I go back. I walked past the guy that gave me the bullshit directions. Now, I'm hoping, as a man, that this guy is gonna continue to lie for me. At least do that. When I say, "Hey, man, there's no escalator over there," I'm hoping this guy's gonna be like: "What? It was just there one hour ago. [ALL LAUGHING] They moved it?" But nothing. I go, "Hey, man, there's no escalator over there." This guy goes: [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] That's the problem in the Middle East. Arab men, you need to know how to say, "No. I don't know." Do you realize how much shit could've been avoided? The Iraq War would never have happened. They knew they didn't have weapons of mass destruction. But when the U.S. asked them: "Do you have weapons of mass destruction?" "Yes, of course. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Everybody has weapons of mass destruction." Even the Iraqi people were like, "What are you doing? Shut up." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] "Where are they?" [IN ARABIC ACCENT] "Okay. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Go straight, then left, then right." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING AND APPLAUDING] And I don't speak Arabic. Sadly, I don't speak any other languages. I know, you know, phrases and stuff in other people's languages, but I have a theory. If you don't speak another language, you can fake it. The trick is to know what another language sounds like. And then when you do your impression of it, sound angry when you do it. Because when you're angry, you'll screw up whatever you're trying to say anyway. It doesn't matter what language even if you speak the language. You know, just-- You'll get angry and you'll screw it up. So if you know what it sounds like, you can fake it by just sounding angry. Like, I'll give an example. If I went to India, there's over 200 languages in India. I don't know any of them at all. I know, like, a couple of greetings, but I don't know enough to get me in or out of trouble. But I know what they all sound like. And if I was stuck in India and I needed some help, I would just fake it. They would never know. I could be stuck in India in a market, I'll be like: [YELLING IN HINDI INDISTINCTLY] [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] They won't know. They'd be like, "Oh, my God, he's very angry. I don't know. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I don't know what dialect that one is, but this man is very angry. He's most angry. He's very cross, so cross." That's what Indian people do. We don't want that bad energy. "We take it and throw it out of our heads! We don't-- We don't-- Get out of my head and into my car!" [ALL LAUGHING] Same thing with any language, you can fake it. I'm going to Hong Kong in a couple of weeks. If I get stuck there, fuck it. I don't speak Cantonese. I know what it sounds like. act angry. [YELLING IN CHINESE INDISTINCTLY] [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] "I don't know what language that man is speaking. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] But whatever the case, he's very mad. So mad, I've never seen somebody so mad in my life." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Big Asian guy, how are you? Good to see you. Good. How are you? You know you're a big Asian guy. I didn't, you know-- [ALL LAUGHING] What style of Asian are you? Chinese. [IN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT] Chinese. I've never heard it quite put with that accent before. "All right, nice to meet you. I'm Chinese." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Where are you from? I was born in Australia. You were born in Australia? "I am, mate. All right. No worries. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. How you doing? No worries. Yeah, yeah." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And you're a big fan of meat or...? According to his shirt, it says fucking "meat." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I didn't put it on there. I-- [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Don't look at me sideways, all right? And what's your name? Peter. Peter. For sure. Absolutely, yeah. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And your girlfriend? "That's Wong. This is Wong." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Do you have a Chinese name, Peter? No. Don't fucking lie to me, Peter. I don't believe you. Where are your parents from? From China, in Taishan. From where? Taishan. "Taishan?" Well, let me tell you something. The "Taishan" is building right now if you don't tell me your Chinese name. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] There's no way your parents went, "That's our baby, Peter." [ALL LAUGHING] No chance. Unless your name is like Pe Ta. You know what I mean? Like, the family name is Ta and his name is Pe, you know? Pe Ta. Pe Ta: [SPEAKING CHINESE INDISTINCTLY] Fei lo, Pe Ta. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] It's fucked up that I said that, Peter, I'm sorry. And that's your lovely lady with you? You guys-- What? Married? Engaged? Engaged. Engaged. Congratulations. When are you guys doing that? [AUDIENCE CHEERING] You don't know? No rush? No. She's like, "No. Fuck that." [ALL LAUGHING] How long you guys been together for? Four years. Four years, wow. Are you waiting to get to eight? That's a lucky number in Chinese. Is that what it is? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] "After eight, mate, then we're good. Yeah, yeah, no worries. Next four years we'll go on a walkabout." [RUSSELL CHUCKLING AND AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And how did you meet? And by "meet," I don't mean-- [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] How did you get together? WOMAN: At work. Work. That's nice. How old are you, Peter? I'm 28. Twenty-eight. Okay, good. Don't rush into getting married at 28. You too? You're 28 as well, sweetheart? Oh, that's nice. Oh. Gonna knock her up at some point, Peter? You think...? [ALL LAUGHING] Little half Asian babies, huh? Hopefully. That's what I'm talking about, buddy. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Good. I have a baby. I have a daughter. I like her. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Yeah, it's a-- Well, she's not here. You don't have to clap. she'll watch this at some point. "Dad, what the fuck?" You know? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You know those kids. You have kids, you two, English guy? No? No, not yet, no. Well, you gotta unfurry your furry area and... [ALL LAUGHING] Ta-da! You know. [ALL LAUGHING] I like being a dad. I-- My daughter's good. She's-- I got a-- She's 2. I-- She's really pretty. I say that like-- Just-- Let me just clear something up. If I had a fucked-up-looking kid, I would be the first to tell you. You know what I mean? I'll be like, "Yeah, I got a little girl. Eh." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Fingers crossed she grows out of it, you know, but... But I'm honest. Like, if-- I hate when people tell you how cute their kid is, then you see their kid, and you're like, "What the fuck is that?" Like, "You gotta see my kid. My kid is--" "What, did you Google a platypus before you showed me your kid? What is that?" [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Not every kid's cute. I mean, they're sweet, but they-- You know, you can look at a kid and be like, argh. I saw a cute baby in the mall the other day, but just a giant head on this kid. Just-- Like, I could tell, like, it couldn't even hold that shit up. [ALL LAUGHING] Just a big head on that baby. I hope he grows into that thing, you know, but... She is a very, very pretty girl, my daughter. She's... She is like-- People see her and they go, "She's so pretty." And to be honest with you, my daughter is pretty because she-- She looks like my ex-wife. My ex-wife is a very good-looking woman, on the outside and... [ALL LAUGHING] She's, you know-- My ex-wife is like a Ferrari with no engine. You know? You're like, "Oh, my God, is that a Ferrari?" "Yeah, it doesn't work. It doesn't work. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Just fucking sits there and costs me money. That's all it does." [ALL LAUGHING] And so are there any pregnant women here tonight? Okay. Sorry that you're in the stairs and you had to climb all that shit-- Ugh. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Pregnant women have it rough. You have no idea until you get pregnant how rough pregnant women have. There's obvious things women go through when they're pregnant. They're uncomfortable, they got-- Their hormones are crazy. They got cravings. They got a human inside of them. You know, their moods are all over the place. That's enough to deal with on your own. But then when you have to deal with other people too, that only adds insult to injury. And especially in America, it's worse. Americans don't give a shit. They'll say whatever they want to you. At least in Australia, like, I don't know what happened to her, mate. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Look a little bit like a kangaroo over there. Yeah, mate, all right." "What did you say?" "Nothing, love. Have a good night. Yeah." "No worries. No worries. Have a healthy child. Yeah, all right, yeah." "Let me give you a carrot." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] They gotta deal with other people. When my ex-wife was pregnant, we were in the mall one time, this girl walks up to my ex-wife, she goes: "Oh, my God, you're pregnant:" [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] She pointed at her stomach, like we didn't know where she was pregnant. You know what I mean? "Oh, my God, you're pregnant. That's a miracle. You have a miracle growing inside of you." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I hate when people say shit is a miracle. It's not a miracle when a woman gets pregnant. It's a blessing, it's not a miracle. Especially when my ex-wife got pregnant. She's Latina, I'm Indian. How hard do you think it was to get pregnant? Know what I mean? You got the two most fertile humans on the planet. We never even had sex. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I just sent her a text one day, "I'm coming home." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [IN WOMAN'S VOICE] "I just saw 'coming.'" [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I hate when people say shit is a miracle. "That's a miracle." It's not a miracle, you know? It'd be a miracle if I was in the wrong hole. Then it's a miracle. You know what I mean? "Oh, my God, you're pregnant. That's a miracle." It is a miracle! I was in her ass. [ALL LAUGHING] This is the most determined child you've ever seen. Do you know how much shit this kid's been through? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I like being a dad, you know. Having a little girl makes you a daddy. I know your Chinese side probably wants a boy, but... [ALL LAUGHING] I don't make up these things, all right? Just going by what I understand. And they get to this age where they repeat everything literally. People warned me about that: "Hey, Russell, when you have a kid, gotta watch what you say because they're gonna repeat everything." "No, they don't." And I forgot that I have a foul mouth. You know what I mean? I forgot about some of the things I do when I'm alone in the car, you know. When I was driving to pick up my daughter a few weeks ago, I was playing N.W.A. on the way there. And because it's so old-school, I wasn't thinking about what they were saying, I was thinking about the memories it brought back for me, you know, the late '80s. I'm like, "N.W.A." And then you start thinking about when-- You know, all these things. I wasn't thinking about what they were saying. Then I pick up my daughter, I put her in the car and-- I don't sing along completely because I don't really know the words to everything. You just sing along when you hear the part you know: And anyway, I got to this part in the song and I was like-- I'm just driving and I'm like: ♪ Yo, got that 5-0 Double-up nigga ♪ And then, two seconds later, from the backseat, I hear: "Nigga!" No, no, no! No. No, no, no. [ALL LAUGHING] And I'm trying to flush her memory, I'm like, "Potato. Potato, baby. Say potato, potato, potato." "Pot-- Potat-- Nigga!" I can't return her to her mother full of filth. [ALL LAUGHING] Is that your wife or your girlfriend or...? ENGLISHMAN: Girlfriend. Girlfriend. How long you been together for? Couple years. Couple years. You're probably gonna-- You thinking about locking her down or are you just gonna waste her time, English guy? [ALL LAUGHING] Why are you sweating right now? For no reason, he's-- [ALL LAUGH] She seems like a lovely lady and you seem to still like each other, you know. Look at them, they're engaged. Been together four years. Still holding hands. Look at that. That's cute. Must be the T-shirt. It is the T-shirt. She's not grabbing his meat, she's holding his hand. [ALL LAUGHING] She's not like this, "Oh, Peter. Yeah, all right." You know, she's not-- [ALL LAUGHING] Just holding his hand, you know. Who has kids? You have kids, sir? Older guy. How are you? I mean, older with respect, not like, "Oh, fucking old." I mean-- I mean, you're obviously older than me, unless you just aged horribly. You know what I mean? [ALL LAUGHING] What's your name, sir? Al. Al. Al. And who are you here with, Al, your family? Yup. Is any of those your kids? My wife and my son. Your wife and your son. AL: And daughter. Daughter or daughter-in-law? Which one? I go, "Daughter or daughter-in-law?" He goes, "Yep." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] That's your wife? Son? Hello. Bastard, hello. He's fucking looking at me. He's like: [ALL LAUGHING] This isn't YouTube. I'm not buffering right now. I'm talking right to you. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Is that your only child, Al? Just-- Yes, he is. Yeah. You like him? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] It's good, right? How old are you, buddy? I'm 26. Twenty-six. Why are you--? What are you so--? What are you so shifty-eyed for? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Well, it would have been great if you weren't chubby when you did that. He was like...and then a big sweat stain right there. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Great. That's gonna be on film forever. When you're your dad's age, you're like, "What the fuck was I thinking? How old are you, dad? Sixty-two. Sixty-two. You look great for 62. You look like shit for 42, but you-- [AUDIENCE CHEERING] You do, you look good for 62. I wasn't expecting 62. That's good. And were you in the room when he was born? AL: Yes. Yep. But that's-- Let me tell you something, guys. If you ever have kids, when your wife goes into labor, do your best to not be there. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Like, be in the vicinity. You could be in the-- You could be in the hospital, you know. You can make her think you're in the room. Like, you know, do some sort of voice note on your phone. "Push, honey, push." And then hit repeat and loop, and then-- [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] But when she's giving birth, don't go in that room. Because women get crazy when they're giving birth. They say the meanest shit to you, don't they? Because they're in pain. They feel that pain, and then they start thinking: "You're the fucking reason for this pain. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I hate you with everything in me right now." They just get mean, don't they? That's-- So here's the problem is women think that men don't think that giving birth hurts. Of course it hurts. It has to hurt. I've had shits that hurt. I can only imagine [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] how much worse it would hurt when you're squeezing a human out of you. But that's part of the deal, ladies, and I'm not, you know-- I'm not trying to downplay how painful it is. It's extreme pain. I can only imagine, you know. But the positive side to the pain of giving birth is that it's physical pain. Which means, it will go away eventually. Six, seven weeks later, your vagina will snap back together. You'll forget all about it. You'll be walking around, you'll stub your toe, you'll be like, "My toe!" I'll be, "What about your vagina?" "Fuck that. My toe hurts." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Physical pain is the best pain you could hope for. I used to box and I would get black eyes and headaches. And-- But after a couple of days, it would go away. I'm not comparing boxing to your box, I'm just saying... [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] that physical pain goes away, you know. When you're giving birth, all you need to do, ladies, is lean back and focus. Focus on squeezing this person out of you. You don't have to see what we saw in that fucking room. We can't unsee it. Six, seven weeks later, your vagina's okay. The rest of my life is fucked! It's been 26 years, you think Al's forgotten? He has not forgotten shit! I'm scared to go down on chicks to this day. It's been two years, I'm scared. I'm jabbing my way in. I'm like: [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] It's dis-- It's the worst thing you could ever see. Isn't it, Al? It's like watching your favorite restaurant burn down. [ALL LAUGHING] No! No! No! [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I mean, they'll rebuild it, you know. But I'm not eating there again. Fuck that. You know, I-- [ALL LAUGHING] That menu's different. They've done all kinds of things. They put a drive-thru in there now. That's-- Mexicans working in the back. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Is he a good kid, Al? Absolutely. Absolutely. Was he a smart child? He was always smart, yeah. He was always. Your dad really loves you. Because my dad would be like, "This guy is a fucking idiot." You know what I mean? Like that-- [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Either your dad-- Either he loves you a lot or he can't stand you and he doesn't want us to know. You know what I mean? Indian dads will say, "This guy is a fucking idiot." "Do you love him?" "Of course I love him. That's my child. But what a fucking idiot, this. What an absolute idiot." [CHUCKLING] My daughter's pretty smart. I-- I'm impressed by her. She's only 2, and she's already speaking Spanish and English, which is impressive to me. I wanted her to learn Spanish first because, first of all, she's half Latina, and we live in California, so, you know, I wanted her to at least know the language of California. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Spanish is a very helpful language in California. You go to a restaurant, you want your car back from valet, you wanna know, like, what to say. You know what I mean? So... [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] So you know what I did? I told my ex-wife's family, they're from Ecuador, I said, "Do me a favor. Please only speak to the baby in Spanish." They were like, "No problem. Hey, don't you want us to teach her English too?" [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] "No. I got this." Last thing I want is my daughter being born in America and sounding like an immigrant. [IN SPANISH ACCENT] "Dada, you coming over?" [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] "No, sweetheart. No Jews are coming over. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Not unless my agent calls." [ALL LAUGHING] And when you do have kids, trust me on this one, buy your children, your babies, buy them educational toys. Best thing you could do. They started learning really young. I bought my daughter this toy and you push the color and it says the color. You-- If you push it, it will be like-- Push yellow and it will be like: Yellow Green, blue The cool thing in America, the educational toys have a switch from English to Spanish. I flicked all her toys to Spanish. Now I'm learning Spanish too. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Mm. Who's thinking? I am. Now, when she pushes it, it goes: [SINGING IN SPANISH] Now I know how to say "yellow," "green" and "blue" in Spanish. But only like an opera singer. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Let me tell you where this backfired on me. A few weeks ago, I was in L.A., I needed some yellow paint. I went to Home Depot and I walked in, and there was a Mexican guy working inside, [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] inside Home Depot. So that's progress. Thank you, Mr. Obama. And I knew he was Mexican. First of all, it's L.A. Secondly, his back was facing me, he was 5'4", had a giant head. There's no neck, he looked like a Rock'em Sock'em Robot that hadn't been punched in the stomach and-- Ding. [ALL LAUGHING] He turned around, his name was Juan. You know what I mean? Juan and he had a little Mexico flag right there. And when I see people and I can tell what their comfort language is, I always like to try and greet them in that language. For two reasons, so that way, first, they think I speak their bullshit, and that way, they won't try and rip me off. And secondly, you know, I just-- It just-- It makes them feel comfortable right away. And when I do say something in your language, I try to say it the best way I can, so you really believe I speak your language. But the minute you reply, I get all fucked up because I've run out of words. So I see him and I go: [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] [SCATTING] [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And I'm like, "Alrighty then, listen." [CHUCKLES] I make it look like we need to go back to English, you know, because you're at work and we need to keep it professional. So I go, "I need some paint." He goes: [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] [IN ENGLISH] I go, "Yellow." [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] [IN ENGLISH] And he holds up gray and white and shades of gray, and shades of white. I'm like, "No, no, no, yellow." [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] "No, Juan, that's gray, white, shades of gray, shades of white." "No, you say 'hielo.'" "No, that's not yellow, yellow. That's fucking gray and white, Juan." "Hielo, mira, ice, ice." "I don't care what your favorite song is right now, I just-- [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I just want yellow paint." "Sí, mira, hielo, ice, ice. " I didn't know that "yellow" meant "ice" in Spanish. I didn't know that. That's not on the toy. So I get in this big argument with the guy. I'm like, "No, not fucking ice, Juan. Yellow." "Sí, mira, hielo." "Stop saying, 'Mira, yellow.' This is not yellow." "Mira, hielo, ice. " "Stop saying yellow ice. I don't want yellow ice. That's disgusting, first of all. I just want yellow." "Stop saying, 'Mira, yellow.'" [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] [IN ENGLISH] "Stop! What do you say then?" [YELLS IN SPANISH] I'm, like, ugh. [SINGS IN SPANISH] Turns out he had the same toy at home. He goes, "Oh, you mean: Yellow [ALL LAUGHING AND CHEERING] I wanna be strict, you know. I wanna be strict with my daughter. She's only 2 so I can't really gauge how I'm gonna be with her yet. I wanna be like my parents, but not as crazy. Because Indian parents are a little crazy with their kids. You know? They... I like-- I-- And I wanna be like a white parent. I love watching white people talk to their kids. White parents have this way of speaking to their children like they're humans. [ALL LAUGHING] It's beautiful to watch. You know? But I think white parents-- I can't be as lenient as a white parent. White parents, you take it a little too far, you know. Like, you give your kids options. They're a fucking kid, they shouldn't have any options. And here's-- I was in the mall the other day. I saw a white lady in the food court, she said to her 5-year-old son, she goes: "Sweetheart, what do you wanna eat for dinner?" The kid goes, "I don't know." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] "Okay, when you figure it out, you let Mommy know and I'll make it for you, okay? I love you." She asked a 5-year-old what he wanted to eat. Not, "Do you want this or this?" What? He could've said any-- "I want shoes. I wanna eat a pair of shoes." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] She would've had to make him a pair of shoes. I'm not-- I can't even comprehend, like-- I grew up in an immigrant house. You-- In an immigrant house, Mom does not-- There's no dinner for the adults and dinner for the children. Mom does not care what the fucking kids like. Mom does not cook for the kids. Mom cooks for Dad. Whatever Dad liked is what you were eating for dinner. That's the way it worked. There were-- [ALL CHEERING] It doesn't matter what your dad liked, that's what you were having for dinner. It turns out my dad used to love molten hot plates of lava. I was the only 5-year-old farting fire at 5. [MIMICS EXPLOSION] They used to call me Dragon Ass at school. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] But white parents explain things to their kids, you know. They do. They take the time to do that. That's nice. Indian parents, they're the worst. If they don't want you to do something, they will make up the most insane story as to why you shouldn't do something and scare you into not ever thinking about doing it. You don't think your parents are creative, you're like: "They couldn't be making that up. That must have happened, you know." I'll give an example. I grew up just outside of Toronto, small town called Brampton. And, uh-- B-town, represent. I-- And I grew up in these townhouses and all the driveways were attached in the townhouses. And at the edge of the driveway was a road. A major road where all the cars can drive. We were obviously not allowed to play on the road. Only play on the dr-- Only allowed to play on the driveways, for obvious reasons. Now, this was the white lady next door telling her son not to play on the road. "Sweetheart, Mommy doesn't want you to play on the road." "Why not?" "Because it's not safe." "So?" "So you could get hurt." "I don't care." "Well, I do." "So?" "If you get hurt, you'll make Mommy sad. Do you wanna make Mommy sad?" "No." "Then, be a good boy and play on the driveway." "Okay." "I love you." Mwah, mwah, mwah. [ALL LAUGHING] It was so good. She explained it to him. She told him why he shouldn't do it. He-- She gave him the consequences as to what could happen. He had all the information he needed to not play on the road. And you know what? He didn't play on the road. Not my dad. This is my dad telling me the same thing. [IN HINDI ACCENT] "Russell! [ALL LAUGHING] Don't go on the road, you'll get hit by the car and you'll break apart." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [IN REGULAR TONE] Not I might get hit by a car. No, I will get hit by the car. Apparently, there's only one car in my neighborhood and I was going to get hit by it and I was gonna break apart. How the fuck do you break apart? [ALL LAUGHING] As a kid, I thought I was made out of Lego because I was gonna break apart one day. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] They scare you into not doing things. I don't have tattoos. That's because my dad scared me into not having-- "You have a tattoo and you'll find out. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] That's how you got hepatitis. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Do you want hepatitis?" "No." "Then don't get a fucking tattoo." [ALL LAUGHING] You have any tattoos, Al? AL: No. No. You know why? You're from-- I'm not saying I'm from your generation, but my generation emulated yours a little bit. Your generation-- Am I lying? You had to earn tattoos. You never just went and got one blindly, did they? No. The only ti-- When I was a kid, the only people I saw with tattoos were old white guys and they would have like a fucked-up-looking anchor on their forearm. It wouldn't look like an anchor. Like a check mark. You know? Like, he got it when they hit some rough water. It was like, ugh. And then-- [ALL LAUGHING] When I was a kid, you-- Tattoos meant something. Now it doesn't mean shit. Everybody goes and gets one. It equals nothing to me anymore. Like, "Why did you get a tattoo?" "It's just to express my individuality." No. No. You're a fucking idiot. That's what happened. And you decided to be just like everyone else. You used to be able to look at somebody and you could tell by what their tattoo was, where it was, what kind of person they were. Like, if you saw somebody with a neck tattoo, you were like, "That's a crazy son of a bitch right there." And they'd always have something crazy on their neck, "FTW." Fuck the world. And then they would have a teardrop tattoo, you know. "What's the teardrop for?" "I killed a motherfucker. And I couldn't cry my own tears." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] "Don't you quit on me." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Now, it doesn't matter where the tattoo is or what it is. You got these little emo kids with skinny jeans and "life is difficult" tattooed on their neck. Real tears running down his face. "Why are you crying?" "It hurt." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] People get crazy, they do the sleeve now. What do-- "I got a sleeve. I did my whole arm." That's cool right now. In 10 years, you're gonna regret it. That's like having an Ed Hardy shirt on for the rest of your life. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Sorry, Lebanese people. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] "No worries, mate. Apparently, he doesn't like Ed Hardy." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You gotta think-- I see your tattoo, sweetheart. I see it. You look upset that I'm talking about tattoos. But what is that on your arm? What did you get? A nautical star. It says "dream big, work hard." A nautical star that says "dream big, work hard." [ALL LAUGHING] When you say it out loud, do you see how ridiculous that is? Do you see...? [ALL LAUGHING] Just saying maybe on the way to the tattoo shop, you should have said it out loud a few times. Oh, which-- You have five tattoos? What was your first one? I've got one on my back. You've got one on your back. [ALL LAUGHING] What is it? Musical note. It's what? A musical note? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Is it on your back? A tramp stamp? What is it? Is it...? Shoulder. You should put it right at the base of your back, call it-- Put a base clef, you know, like-- [ALL LAUGHING] Is it a treble clef, bass clef, what is it? Treble clef. Are you a singer? Or do you want guys to whistle when they're fucking you? Is that like, "I got a nice clef"? [ALL LAUGHING] I don't understand. What-- What was you first tattoo? The musical note. Yup. Was the treble clef on your back, good. One day, you just looked in the mirror and you were like, "Fuck." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] My back is boring. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] It needs a soundtrack." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Women are the worst with this shit because they don't think. They always put these little corny sayings all over them and then, "Musical note on my back." Women start with a cute tattoo, don't they? "What did you get?" "I got a dolphin on my ankle. Ding." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You gotta think about the future. When you're 80 years old, that dolphin is gonna look like a can of tuna. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] That treble clef is gonna look like a fucking teardrop on your ass. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Your nautical compass is gonna be all out of whack. "It used to point north, now it just-- Everything goes south." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And what does it say? "Dream big." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You gotta think about the future. Nobody thinks about getting old anymore. When I was your age-- How old are you? Actually, I'm 19. Nineteen? What the fuck? You haven't even had skin long enough. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] At least have skin for at least 20 years before you start fucking it up. You know what I mean? Because, again, you're too-- You're young and not thinking about the future. I'm glad I never got any tattoos because, after 40, your skin doesn't snap back the way it does right now. Like, your skin after 40 is literally like finding your favorite pair of underwear from, like, five years ago. "Oh, my God, I still have these." You pull the waist, it goes-- And doesn't snap back, you know? You're like, "Wow, my favorite underwear is now my favorite dusting cloth. This is perfect, you know." [ALL LAUGHING] You gotta think-- I see, buddy, you got a sleeve, you got all kinds of weird shit going on over there. What is that? What do you got there other than no arm left? What happened? What was your first tattoo there, Tony Tats? What is that? A dragon. A dragon. Because you have bad breath or... [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] What made you get a dragon? Obviously, you're not Chinese or something. You like dragons? You know they're not real, right? Yeah. [ALL LAUGHING] "I like dragons. I have a bunch of them." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And then you were like, "You know what, I got this dragon and another arm." And then you just went fucking ham on the other arm, didn't you? Where are your parents from? You're obviously not a white guy. What? Syria. Syria. One guy clapping. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] "No, no, there was mosquito, I had to..." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You know your Syrian parents don't fucking appreciate your arms right now. "Back home, son, we would have cut off your arms. You look like sharmuta, cut off your arm." [ALL LAUGHING] I see yours too, buddy. You guys aren't thinking, are you? What-- How old are you? MAN: Thirty-five. Thirty-five. And how long ago did you get that dragon? Five years ago. Five years ago. At 30 you were like, "You know what? This arm needs a fucking dragon. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And I never wanna see this arm again." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] The Asian guy beside you has a tattoo. Do you have a dragon? Because that would make more sense to me. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Do you have a dragon? Yeah. Yeah, he does. Show us. Where's your dragon? He fucking has a dragon. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING AND CHEERING] You should have like a tank or something, know what I mean? Like something that describes where you're from, you know? Like a-- Like a-- Like a fake set of bombs strapped to your arm, you know what I mean? Like... [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Even the Asian guy, "They're so stupid. The Arab guy has a dragon." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] "Hey, dragon arms." [ALL LAUGHING] Just saying, think about the future. Why do you have a dragon? Were you born year of the dragon or...? Dragons are more in tune with you being Asian, so I'm not really mad at you for having that, you know? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Women get cute with the tattoos. They always put the sayings and shit on them. There's a girl on one of my shows, I go, "What do you got?" She goes, "I got one here, one here and I got stuff on my back." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I go, "I got stuff on my back too, but I-- I wax it off." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I go, "What do you got on your back?" She goes, "Scriptures. I have scriptures written all over my back." She had scriptures written all over her back. Who is that for? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] The guy fucking her, that's who it's for. Don't know about you, but first time I bone this chick, I don't wanna flip her and the Bible's staring me in the fucking face. You know? "Yeah, baby, turn over. What the fuck? [ALL LAUGHING] Oh, my God, I'm gonna come. Give me your face." [WOMAN'S VOICE] "Why are coming in my face?" "Because I don't wanna come on Jesus." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] It's really uncomfortable. My mom is sitting right there. And I just did that. Sorry, Ma. It's your fault I didn't know these words before. [ALL LAUGHING] You should've bought me an educational toy. I'm jealous of tattoos. That's my real problem with tattoos, I'll be honest with you. Because, first of all, you can't get a tattoo after 40. You look like you're going through some midlife crisis. You look like an idiot getting a tattoo after 40. And the other reason is, I'm a hairy Indian guy. I don't have the real estate for a tattoo. You know what I mean? What am I gonna get, a tiger peering through the hair on my chest? You know: [ROARING] [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Girls are gonna be like, "Oh, my God, the grass looks so real." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] "Megan, Megan, come here, look. He's got like a 3D HD-- Oh, my God. You can feel it. It's so gross." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] How old are you, kid? You look young. SHAHAN: Fifteen. Fifteen. That's an awkward age, right? Yeah. Don't get any tattoos, you're only 15. Don't do what she did at 15 or whatever the fuck she was-- She's only 19, so... I mean, I don't know when you got the treble clef. How old were you when you got your treble clef? Eighteen. [AUSTRALIAN ACCENT] Eighteen. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [IN REGULAR TONE] In one year, she got five tattoos. No regard for her body. You seem like a nice brown kid, don't... [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Don't fuck this up, you know? You're 15, you're in your prime whacking years, just enjoy that. You know what I mean? [LAUGHING AND CHEERING] It's okay, buddy. We've all been there. You know what I mean? Who's with you? Is that your dad? My uncle. Your uncle. How old are you, uncle? Thirty-four. Thirty-four. You know what I'm saying. Know what I mean? Fifteen, just like: [YELLING] That's all. That's all you wanted to do at 15, you know? Hey, and just-- What's your name, buddy? Sorry? Shahan. Sahan? Shahan. Shahan. Shah-off. Shahan. Shah-off. Shahan, when you're jerking Shah-off, [ALL LAUGHING] I want you to know that there's nothing wrong with you, all right? Just enjoy it. Remember, uncle? You know what I'm saying, huh? Fifteen: [ROARS] Even in your 20s, in your 20s, as a guy, you could jerk off like eight times a day and still fuck at night. It was an incredible time, you know. [GROWLS] I mean, you don't really do it properly, but you can-- [MIMICKING VIBRATING SOUND] [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Don't try this either tonight. Don't-- Don't get carried away, is all I'm saying. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING AND CHEERING] It never ends for a man, Shahan, you will always, as long as you have arms, [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] for the rest of-- Al, 62. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You still crank it out every now and then. Let's not lie to each other, Al. You know what I mean? It's not as frequent as it once was. I mean, you know, maybe-- Maybe once a month even. But whatever, you gotta empty the pipes. You know what I'm saying? You know when it slows down, uncle? You're only 34, you don't know this yet. But after 40 is when it slows down. That's when you-- You gotta make decisions in life, you know? You'll still do it, but it's not done with the same frequency or willingness as it once was. Like, I'm-- Like tonight, I'll give you an example. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] If I don't get laid tonight after my show, I don't give a shit. I will go back to my hotel room, open up my laptop, put on some porn, crank one out and go to sleep like a fucking gentleman. You know what I mean? [ALL LAUGHING] The problem is after 40, you get tired way easier. Do you know how many nights I've had it happen when I put my laptop on my chest and I fall asleep with my dick in my hand, just-- [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] While the movie was loading. While the movie-- It hadn't even started. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And the only reason I wake up is because the heat from my laptop is burning my chest. "I'm on fire!" Aah. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I grew up like an immigrant, and even though I was not an immigrant in Canada, I felt like an immigrant. And then I moved to the States seven years ago and actually became an immigrant. It's kind of a weird process for me. You know, being a Canadian living in America-- All right, yeah. Three Canadians. Good. Oh, one Canadian flag. Good. Good deal. Hold that up. We'll get a shot of it. Don't you want that on the fucking DVD? That's right. That's what it looks like. That's our flag. A leaf. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Symbol of strength and...fall. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] The immigrant experience is a lot harder than you think it is, you know. You really gotta give your parents props if they came from another country to here or wherever they went to because they really took a chance, you know. My parents left India in 1965, and they moved straight from India to Toronto, which is where I was born and raised by wolves and-- [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And I don't know how thick my dad's accent was when he moved to Canada, but it never got thinner in the 40 years he was alive there. My dad had this ability to give everything an accent. Everything. It doesn't matter what it was. And not words. Any immigrant could fuck up words. My dad would fuck up sounds. One time my dad's car broke down, he called and goes: "Son, the car is broken down." I go, "What happened?" "I don't know." "Well, what's wrong with the car?" "If I knew that, I'd be a 'mechanic.'" And not words. "What the hell is a 'mechanic?'" "The bastard that fixes the car." And not words. "Oh, I think you mean 'mechanic.'" "Don't be stupid. There is no K in it." And not words. That's how you could tell. You can tell how Indian somebody is by how many fingers they point with. I was born in North America, one finger. "You, you, you." People from India, four fingers to point at one thing. "Just see, see these bastards. See. Just see. See everybody. See. See, see, see." See, in India, that-- This makes total sense. Because there's so many people there, you can't pinpoint shit. "Where is he?" "There, there, there. See? There, there, there." "I don't know. You're pointing at four things right now." "What are you--? Stop saying 'there.' Where?" "There." "Stop-- You're saying 'there' more times. Where?" "In that vicinity. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] That particular 'group' of people." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] They say things in India that make total sense in India but make no sense outside of India. Like-- I'll give an example. Last year I was in India, I went to visit my uncle in Bombay. I went to his apartment, and I was like, "Oh, hey, uncle, this is a new place. Did you move?" He goes, "Yeah, son. Few years back we shifted." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] He said they shifted. They don't say they moved in India. They don't-- "Did you move?" "No, no, son. We shifted. Few years back we shifted to this place." They shifted. You can't use that outside of India. Imagine if you're moving tomorrow. Like, "What are you doing?" "I'm shifting." "Just stop it, you shifty bastard. What's wrong with you?" You know? Shifting. But that makes total sense in India "shifting," doesn't it? Because there's so many people there, you can't fucking move. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You just kind of shift. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] "Hey, did you just move to here?" "Recently I shifted to here. Yes." Just shifted." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] So I say to my dad, "What were you doing when your car broke down?" "I was making the turn." "You were making the turn?" Even though we were on the phone, I knew he went-- [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You-- If you're Indian your whole life, you know the pauses on the phone are-- [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] I go, "What do you mean making the turn? Were you creating the turn?" "I was not creating the turn. The turn was there, I was making it." "So the turn existed when you got there?" "Of course it existed, how else would I have made it?" "Well, who made it?" " I don't know who made it, but I was making it." "So was it made or were you making--?" "Don't you question me, you bastard!" [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] When you get an Indian father mad, the go-to is, "You bastard!" They will-- My dad would call me a bastard. That doesn't make any sense. "You bastard!" "Dad, I can't be a bastard. You're my dad." "Am I? Am I? Were you there when it happened?" [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] He would get so mad, he would call me a son of a bitch in front of my mom. "You son of a bitch!" My mom was like, "Eric." "Not you, honey, obviously. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] The proverbial bitch that's out there. He's not your child or my child. He's the bastard son of that son of a bitch! He's a bastard bitch!" [ALL LAUGHING] I knew how to get him riled up. "So, Dad, did you create this turn or was it made when you got there?" "It was made. I did not create it. I was making it." "You can't make something that's already made." "I did not make it. I was not making it. I was making it." "By extending the word 'make' doesn't mean you made it, Dad." [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] You wanna get an Indian person upset, tell them they did something illegal. "Dad, was this legal?" "Of course it was legal! It was totally legal! I was at an intersection, I put on my indicator." "Did your indicator work?" And this is where my dad screws up the sound. "It was working just fine." Tak, tatak, tatak, tatak. [ALL LAUGHING] I go, "What the hell is that noise?" "That's my indicator." Tak, tatak, tatak, tatak. "Why does your indicator have an accent? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] "You know it's not an India-cator, right? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Shouldn't it be going:?" [MIMICKS CAR INDICATOR] "That's what it's doing. What are you hearing?" Tak, tatak, tatak, tatak. "All right, then what happened?" "Then I proceeded to make the turn. Suddenly, the engine went:" [MIMICKING CLANGING SOUND] [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] "Your engine did what? [MIMICKING CLANGING SOUND] Your engine went:? [MIMICKING CLANGING SOUND] [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Let me get this straight. Your indicator went: Tak, tatak, tatak, tatak. And then your engine went:" [MIMICKS CLANGING SOUND] "Right." "Dad, your car is an illegal immigrant." Thank you very much, Sydney. You guys were awesome. [ALL CHEERING] Yay!
