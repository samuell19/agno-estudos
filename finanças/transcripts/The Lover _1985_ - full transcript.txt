We're closed, mister. We're closed. I told you, we're closed. Everyone's going home, come tomorrow. What are you waiting for? Take it away from here. Closed, mister. Closed now. Didn't you hear me? We're closed. Come back tomorrow, huh. Mister, what are you waiting for? ADAM: What happened? It's nothing, just a loose screw or something. When is the last time you drove it? GABRIEL: Five years ago. What? They tell me that you have a spare part. ADAM: For a 1950 Morris? Forty-seven. What do you think, mister, I'm running here, a museum? [CHUCKLES] Why are you fixing it? Do you wanna sell it? I can't, it's not mine. Not yours? No, but it's a matter of hours. What's a matter of hours? Until it is mine. An inheritance. Tell you what, you can push it over there in the corner, come back in a week, we'll have it ready for you as good as new. If not, just leave it here, we'll dump it. Help him, Hameed. A big job? Overhaul. Oh. Hey, Arya, give us a hand here. Come on, over in the corner there. [STATIC ON TV] Aren't you coming to sleep? I didn't finish yet. Dafi, go to sleep. Dafi. Mmm? Good night. Good night, Daddy. Good night, Mom. Good night, Dafi. Did you put everything away? Yeah. Did you wipe up the crumbs? [SIGHS] No. Have you finished? Few more to go, I'll finish in the morning. Aren't you teaching the early class? Yes, I am. I'll get up at 6:00. Don't you think you're overdoing it lately, with all this school work? What do you mean? Conferences, staff meetings, exams, papers. Nobody sees you around anymore. Forget about me, but what about Dafi? Does she look to you like a girl suffering from lack of motherly love? No, just like a girl who would prefer to see a little bit more of her mother. I wouldn't worry about her if I were you. What about your PhD, did you decide to give it up? What's the matter? I can't go on being a wife without a degree? I thought it's important to you. It is important. And I didn't translate even one word from the new material I received. What material? The article in Spanish about the Jews that worked for Queen Isabella. [GRUNTS] [BREATHES HEAVILY] [MOANING] [SIGHS] You don't have to if you don't want to. What makes you think I don't want to? I just feel like you're doing it for me. [SIGHS] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [THUDS] Good as new, huh? [SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE] [MEN APPLAUDING] You did it, Mr. Adam. A resurrection. You ought to be in school, kid. Not here. Here's his bill. Give it to him. I don't understand. What's to understand? £4,000. I'm sorry, I didn't realize it would be so expensive. I don't have that much. So, why'd you bring it here in the first place? I thought it was just a loose screw. It's not a screw. It's £4,000. But I don't have that much. So borrow. There's no one to borrow from. Find someone, relatives, whoever you want. I don't have any relatives. Friends? No one, I haven't any relatives. I am willing to sign an IOU, and the minute I get money... Give me the keys, the car is staying right here for a month. If you still can't pay then, we'll sell it. You can't do it. Why not? The car is just like new. It's not his. Almost mine, it's a matter of hours. The doctors don't hold out any hope. What the hell is this guy talking about? [SIGHS] You are the one with the screw loose, buddy. The car is fine. My grandmother... You okay? It's just hunger. I haven't eaten for two days. I ran out of money. A real comedian. I forgot how hot it is here. Where have you been? Argentina. Mmm-hmm. Have you come back for good or just for a visit? GABRIEL: Short trip. I came to pick up an inheritance. The Morris? Is that how much you're getting? There is a house as well, I mean, an apartment, furniture. But there is a problem. What, with the apartment? No, with my grandmother. What's the problem? She isn't dead yet. Mmm? I mean, she's been unconscious for two weeks. Hardly breathing, but alive. She's a fighter. Maybe she'll pull out of it. No, it's just a matter of hours. She's gonna die any minute. This is our daughter, Dafi. Shake hands. Gabriel. Nice to meet you. Gabriel is gonna help Mother with her Spanish translations. Oh, you're the owner of the Morris. No, not quite. It's a matter of hours. And when did you finish at the university? GABRIEL: I didn't finish. I was out of touch for a few years. Uh-huh. Involved in something else? I was in the hospital. What for? A mental hospital. It was a long time ago. Loose screw, huh? [LAUGHING] [BOTH LAUGHING] Na'im. Na'im, come here. I need you to run an errand. So you don't wanna go to school, huh? Of course I do, it's my father. He won't let you? I already have two brothers in school, he thinks that's enough sons who don't work. Ah. Take this, the key to my house. Bring me my wallet. You know the black... I forgot it. On the cabinet, in the entrance. Sure, of course. Do it fast, it's important. [DOOR SLAMS] [SCREAMS] No! Excuse me, Mr. Adam sent me. I'm from the garage. Your father, uh, gave me the key to pick up his, uh, wallet. He forgot it. Don't be scared. I'm not a burglar. It's okay. He asked me to bring him his wallet. Wait a minute. You want something to drink? Drink? No, thanks. Yes, please. [STUTTERS] If you have some water. [GULPS] Thanks for the water. "I brought her to the river, "I believed her to be a virgin, "but she already had a husband." It was the feast of Santiago, and it was as if I was trapped. The night lights were dimmed, and the crickets were awakened. [SPEAKING SPANISH] These I've written already. I can see you have done a lot of work. And this needs to be translated. It was never published in Israel, and it's very important for my PhD. Mmm-hmm. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Those documents were found recently. It's about Jews that hid their origins in order to reach high positions, and then they mistreated other Jews. I'm talking so much, I don't let you read a word. I enjoy listening to you. Isn't it about time he left? Are you really planning to have him work here? I don't know, it depends on your mother. If it's up to her, he's got a full-time job. [CHUCKLING] So? I think he'll do fine. He already started translating something. ADAM: Good. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Mmm-hmm. Desperation? No, no. [SPEAKS SPANISH] Disappointment? Mmm-hmm. It's okay? Mmm, it's okay. You sure? I think so. Disappointment. No, I don't think it's good. [EXHALES SHARPLY] Not disappointment. Why? I think it's a good word. [MOANING SOFTLY] [GASPS] What time is it? Quarter to 6:00. What were you dreaming about? Why, did I say something? Yeah. What did I say? I couldn't make it out. What a strange dream I had. I was standing in the class, and suddenly the principal came in. It wasn't Schwartzy. Someone I don't know. And he yelled at me. "Why do you stand naked in front of the class?" And I looked at myself, and I had no clothes on. I wanted to run, but there was no door. So? That was it. How is your work coming along? Fine. Is he coming today? Who? Yes. Are you keeping track of his hours? No. At this rate we are going to owe him money. I'll give him back the car. Already? What else was in your dream? I don't remember. Why do you ask? I think you said something like, "Sweetheart, sweetheart." Wow! Look at your hair. You don't like it? It's great. We didn't know whether we should wait to eat, you didn't leave a note. What do you think? It's nice. [LAUGHS] Very nice. Mom, you look incredible. What's this? I bought you something at the beauty parlor. Oh, thanks, it's beautiful. Come eat. I'm not hungry. Are you sure? Have something. Maybe something. I'll just take off my shoes. Do you really like it? Mmm-hmm, it holds my hair. I mean, my hairdo. Yes, it's nice. It's beautiful. [CHUCKLES] [PHONE RINGS] Hello? Uh, no, he's not here yet. Goodbye. It was a phone call. I said you were not in yet. Okay, okay. Come in the water, Tally? [ALL GIGGLING] Oh, Dafi! [LAUGHING] No! Dafi! [LAUGHING] Dafi! Dafi, give it to me. Dafi. I'll kill you. Give it to me. Dafi! [CHUCKLES] Dafi! It's me. Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom? [SOBBING] Mom? Mom? ASIA: Dafi. Mom, what's wrong? ASIA: Nothing's wrong, I'm working. So, open the door. Just a minute, I wanna finish something. [SOBBING] What's the matter, Dafi? I thought something happened to you. What could have happened to me? I don't know. How come you're back so early? I'm sick of going to the beach. Why don't you rest for a while? You haven't stopped running around all this summer. Are you going to the movies tonight? Maybe, I don't know. Come, come and rest. GABRIEL: What do you think about this sentence? Don't be scared. I'm sure she didn't hear. [ASIA AND GABRIEL CHUCKLING] [DOOR SLAMS] Why don't you eat? I bought your favorite cheese. No, I think you understand it very well. Yeah. Nah, it's going to be very good. [CHUCKLES] [BELL RINGING] [TIRES SCREECH] [TRAIN HORN BLOWING] [TRAIN HORN BLOWING] [CAR ENGINE STOPS] These are for you. Thank you. This is Lorca. Really? It belonged to my grandfather. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Take off your bra. Okay. Take it off yourself. I just want to know that you are naked underneath. I promise, I won't do anything. Your panties, too. Please. You promised not to do anything. Just a touch. [MOANS] [GASPS] [BREATHES HEAVILY] [CHUCKLES] [GRUNTS] What are you doing? I've brought him home his Morris. Tell him to come and pick it up. Mmm? Give him this money, too. I don't want him to think that we took advantage of his services. [HORN HONKING] Here's Dafi's father. Go tell him that she's getting dressed. Where is Dafi? She's getting dressed. Shall I call her? ADAM: No, I'll wait. Are you coming with us? Yes. Can I wait in the car? Sure. [CAR ENGINE STARTS] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [SIREN BLARING] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] MAN 1: What's going on? MAN 2: I don't know. MAN 3: What is it? MAN 2: You got your radio? Switch on the radio. The sirens, they're genuine. MAN 3: No, it's only... It's a test. [RADIO BEEPS] Papa. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Listen. MAN: [ON RADIO] This is the Israeli Broadcasting Service on radios 1 and 2. The time is 3:00. Here is a special announcement. Hey, look. The military spokesman has announced that close to 2:00 this afternoon the Egyptian and Syrian forces attacked our lines at the Sinai and the Golan Heights. Our forces are fighting back. Did you hear the radio? Government barracks, all of us, right now, come on. I'll see you when I see you. Because of Syrian aircraft flights... Okay. Right. ...over the Golan Heights, sirens are being sounded across the country. [DOG BARKING] They have rising and falling tones. Give us a lift there, come on. They are genuine. I repeat, they are genuine. In an unscheduled cabinet meeting... We heard the radio. ...the cabinet decided... Just stay with the radio. ...that the situation necessitated a partial calling up of all reserve units. Schlomo! The minister of transport has requested that anyone who does not have to travel... DAFI: I know your brother's in the army, but what are you so worried about? It'll all be over in a few days. MAN: [ON RADIO] Cairo Radio interrupted its broadcast at 2:10 and announced that Israeli troops have attacked Egyptian forces in the Bay of Suez. My grandmother's house doesn't have a bomb shelter. I can't talk right now. I'll call back later. Bye. MAN: [ON RADIO] ...that fighter planes are involved and that warships are approaching the west coast of the bay. Cairo Radio announced that Egyptian troops returned fire. Damascus Radio announced that Israeli troops embarked simultaneously on an attack on Syria. Police headquarters in Jerusalem ask all policemen who have not yet been called up to report immediately in uniform. Stay tuned to your radio for further special announcements. This is the Israeli Broadcasting Service from Jerusalem... Do you want some? ...on radios 1 and 2. Why didn't you ask me? Dafi! [PHONE RINGS] It's nothing, I'll clean it up. DAFI: Hello. Hello. Yeah, yes. Eli, they took you, too? Ah, civil defense, okay. And that's it? I hope the Arabs don't pull any surprises tomorrow and decide not to show up. Eh... What can I tell you? Take care of yourself and, uh, come back home. Bye. MAN: [ON RADIO] ...crossed the northern part of the line and that Syrian planes have been called into... Everyone is getting called up. What about you? MAN: [ON RADIO] ...attacked Egyptian strongholds along the Bay of Suez. WOMAN: [ON TV] But, as in previous wars, this war was forced upon us. We're a very small people, small in numbers. There is no comparison between the numbers in our army and the numbers of any one of the countries... [AIRCRAFT PASSING BY] Ours or theirs? Ours. And certainly, no comparison with the massive... Come have some tea. Maybe you're getting a fever. ...armies of men of all those that have joined in this war against us. Do you want something to drink? No. ASIA: Are you all right? Why aren't you sleeping? The heat. What's wrong? Somebody may walk in. Hug me. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Tight. [GASPS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [GASPING] [MOANING] Mmm! MAN: [ON RADIO] UN Military Observers reported this afternoon that Egyptian forces crossed the Suez Canal today at five points... What happened? Did they advance? You really ought to go down there. Where? To the army. Check out your status. They could make a lot of trouble for you if you want to leave the country. Why risk it? Do you think they need me there? Just show up, so they know you did the right thing. Sign on a few forms, and that's all. They won't send you to the front. There's nothing to worry about. Maybe in a few days. Tomorrow. You'd better go now. Tomorrow, this war might be over, and it will be too late. You could be in lots of trouble. Why don't they call you up? You don't worry about me. I did my share in the War of Independence. I lost a kidney. Get dressed. You have enough money? Yes. You sure? Yeah. If they let you go today, come straight back here. If not, just call up. Just a minute. Just a minute, telephone tokens. You might need them. MAN: [ON TV] I'm on a frontline pickup station for the wounded. The fierce battle that has been raging all night has yet to be won. The commander told how in the Six-Day War the same unit participated in the battle to retain this ground. Now, like then, the men are fighting like lions. The feeling is that the enemy will be defeated within a few hours. But until then, the fighting continues and air force helicopters with the wounded are constantly landing. After being given initial treatment, the wounded are transferred from here to hospitals. [PHONE RINGS] This is Arnon Ayvaz from the Southern Campaign. Hello. Yes? Who is it? ADAM: Who? Who is it? Let me have it? No, no. It's a wrong number. Who was it? Wrong number. I guess they drafted him after all. He can still show up. At this hour? Maybe he went straight home. [AIRCRAFT PASSING BY] You have his number? I have it written down somewhere. So call him. DAFI: What are you so worried about? The whole country got drafted. Why should he be any different? ASIA: Morning. For the next few days, I'll conduct Ari's lessons. Let's open the books to where you left off. I believe it's the chapter about... [KNOCKING ON DOOR] ...the original settlements. Just a moment. She's really good. What did you expect? You're always complaining about her. Not as a teacher. Students, our school has lost one of its faculty members. Anan Selam, the gym teacher, was killed in action on the Golan Heights. I'm afraid there've been many casualties. Look at your mother. Go to her. Asia. Asia. Asia. You shouldn't sleep in your clothes. Why don't you put on the nightgown? Did you have a bad dream? What did you dream about? You need to sleep. You always tell Dafi that bad dreams clear your mind. Come. Come to bed. We're going to sleep. I love you. [SIGHS] Come to bed. Good morning. Good morning. Gabriel Arditi. Army address? I don't know. You don't know his army address? No army address. No ID number. You're sure he was called up? Absolutely. There's no doubt about it. Gabriel who? Arditi. You're a relation? He's a friend of mine. Just friend? What do you mean "just"? He's a friend. I'm sorry. I can't help you. We can only speak with members of the family. [PHONE RINGING] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Wait out here. MAN: [ON TV] And yes, they've arrived. The plane with the first of the prisoners from Egypt has just landed. It is difficult to describe the excitement here at the airport. And here they come, off the plane. Tired, pale, but the look in the eyes says it all. "We're back home." Emotional family members find it difficult to believe that the nightmare is over. And who knows, maybe this is really the beginning of a new era. What did you think? Our boys are back home. Dafi, get off the phone. Really? Dafi, will you please get off the phone? You must not. Dafi! What's the matter with you? Hang up the phone. Maybe somebody's trying to call. He's not going to call. Don't you understand? He's not going to call. [SIGHS] It's getting so you can't even breathe around here. Excuse me, do you live here? Yes. Whom are you looking for? Mrs. Arditi. Do you know her? Yes. She is my neighbor. She's not at home. Where is she? At the hospital. Do you have her key? No. Maybe you could just let me in through the balcony. Why do you have to get in at all? Who are you? I'm a friend of Gabriel. Gabriel? Gabriel's gone away. Where? Back abroad. I'd like to know if he took his things with him. Please, could you just let me in through the balcony? Please. I'm sorry. I won't let anyone inside without the old lady's permission. Excuse me. ADAM: Na'im, come here. I need you for some work afterhours. Can you stay here nights? Or do you have to go back to the village? I can stay. Okay. You know how to climb? Climb what? Whatever. Just so that you're not scared of heights. What kind of work are you talking about? Nothing too difficult. You'll see. Nothing illegal, I hope. God forbid. Here, have some money. Buy yourself a toothbrush and some pajamas. I don't need the pajamas. I'll sleep inside the car. No. You'll sleep in my house. In your house? Come by the apartment at 4:00. And, uh... This is between you and me. Understand? Why shouldn't I understand? Just because I'm Arab? [CHUCKLES] Dafi. Shh, shh. Dafi, come here. He's been in there a long time. Maybe something's happened to him. Nothing happened to him. Na'im. Na'im? NA'IM: What? Is everything okay? NA'IM: Fine. [CHUCKLES] [CAR ENGINE STOPS] Climb up there. Open the shutters and jump in. Do not turn the lights on. Just let me in the front door, okay? If somebody comes, I'll whistle. Try to run away. What will you whistle? Well, a song. What do you know? Hava Nagila. Okay. Do not be scared. There's no one there. It's a friend's apartment. I need his papers. He went to the war. Okay? Come. Is he dead? Dead, alive, nobody knows. Come. [GRUNTS] [CLATTERS] [CLATTERS] It was closed from inside. Are you sure? Of course, I opened it. Maybe your friend came back. [DOOR OPENS] MRS. ARDITI: Who is it? If you're looking for gold, you can leave now. Who's there? Excuse me, Mrs. Arditi, you're supposed to be unconscious in the hospital. Well, I'm not. I changed my mind. Who are you, anyway? What are you doing in my house at this hour? You are Gabriel Arditi's grandmother, aren't you? Mmm. Excuse me, Mrs. Arditi, I will explain everything. I am a friend of Gabriel's. I have been looking for him all over. Is it true that he was here in the country? He is still in the country. So where is he? That is exactly what I'm trying to figure out. That's why I came. I'm looking for clues. Clues? He left all his clothes and bags here. Is that a clue? Everything can help. If, God willing, nothing happened to him during the war, so maybe he just got scared and ran. Maybe, he's hiding somewhere. You have to look for him in the night. Why in the night? As a child, he used to run around all night long and sleep during the day. When he got older, he used to steal the keys to my Morris and drive around all night long. To this day, I don't know where. But I always saw that the gas tank was empty. Did you look up his uncle in Jerusalem? You better get up. It's after 12:00. Your father is not home? No, he went with my mother. They went to look for someone. His friend? Which friend? That one we looked for last night at the old lady's house. Oh, yeah, he's not a friend. No? No. He's my mother's lover. What? Kidding. It was just a joke. You have money for the bus? Yes. You know where the bus stop is? Yes. Uh... Well, not really. Want me to take you there? If you like. ARNI: Hi, Dafi. Hi. This is Na'im. I'm Arni. I'm Danny. ARNI: You coming with us, Dafi? Do you know the way from here? Yes. Uh... Thanks from my father. So, who's he? DAFI: Oh, Na'im? He works for my father. Sorry you had to come all this way for nothing. Thank you very much. Yeah, it's been over a year since they moved. I think they're living in Ramat Gan, now. Na'im, I need you to help me nights with a tow truck. Do you think your father will let you sleep in the city? My father doesn't care at all where I sleep. Adam, Friedman is on the phone. I'll talk to him later. For the life of me, I can't figure out what you're doing. Fixing the tow truck. What do we need the tow truck for? We'll take it out at night and bring in more customers. Go find out how much they charge for towing. But who is going to drive? I am. You? Why not? Do you think I forgot what it means to work? Huh, you're a real comedian. Dafi. The newspaper. Where is Dafi? She went shopping with her mother. I'm waiting for her. What time is it? Almost 6:00. Do your parents know where you are? My mother never worries about me. She doesn't care where I am. What about your father? My father went to Germany when I was four years old. He never came back. Do you want something to drink or eat? No, thank you. Why are you going? Sit down. [CHUCKLES] So, are you going to wait for her? Sure. What else do I have to do? [CHUCKLES] Here it is. Help yourself. Thank you. This is the boy I told you about. I know him. That's the Arab who came in through the window. [SPEAKING ARABIC] His name is Na'im. At night he's going to help me look for Gabriel. During the day he can help you if you need anything. He's a good kid, you'll see. Yeah, I know all about them. When they're little, they're good kids. Then they grow up to be terrorists. When there's a wreck, I'll pick you up. So long. So long, Mrs. Arditi. I just hope you find him alive. ADAM: Alive and well. Mrs. Arditi, can't give up hope. [DOOR CLOSES] [SPEAKING ARABIC] I don't want to. Why does every time I walk into a Jewish house I have to take a bath? When guests came to our forefather Abraham, the first thing he would do is wash their feet. I'm sorry, I never studied the Bible. What did you study? Bialik. Bialik in Arabic? No, Bialik in Hebrew. "The heavens beg for compassion. "If there is a god in you, and the bard told him, I did not find it. "You prayed for me. "My heart is like a stone." [SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] Well, well, an Arab boy who knows Bialik. "The conference attended by hundreds of the representatives "received worldwide media coverage." Mmm. "Once again, as in other meetings of this type, "statements were made proclaiming that Arab citizens everywhere "must take up arms and destroy the Jews." Why do they say that? I don't want to destroy you. We'll see about that. [CHUCKLES] [PHONE RINGS] Hello. Yes, this is the towing service. Just a minute. Okay, I'm going now. Thanks for the coffee. Go get some sleep. I'm coming with you. No way! Daddy, I can't sleep anyway. But tomorrow is a school day. I'm coming with you. Yes, just a minute, what about Na'im? I already called him. [CHUCKLES] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] ADAM: Dafi? Dafi? Wake up. We're almost there. What are you doing here? Waiting for someone. Who? I shall take you home? No. But where to? Wherever you like. No, that's dangerous. [TIRES SCREECH] [CHUCKLES] DAFI: Dad. You still up? I waited for you. Yeah, but I told you I would be late. But you didn't say you'd be this late. Where have you been? Tel Aviv. In these clothes? I needed a part urgently. But why did you come so late? I saw a car on the road, a car that looked like the Morris and I chased it. And? Wasn't him. And the car? Mmm-mmm. [DOGS BARKING] You ought to be in school now. [SCOFFS] We mustn't see each other anymore. I don't know what to say, but it's crazy. Don't even think about it. It shouldn't have happened, I know, but I was weak. You have to forget it. Forget me. ADAM: Dafi? Daddy, what's wrong? You sick? No, I'm not sick, I'm tired. [SIGHS] You've been crying. I fought with my math teacher. Again? Schwartzy threatened to expel me. The car yesterday with the little boy, did you find out what happened? I don't know. I decided to stop with the towing. Because of me? Because of everything. I can't go on with it anymore. You gave up on him? Just about. And Mom? She'll give up, too. I don't think you can go on like this. Schwartzy's talking about expulsion. You have to stop going at nights with your father. Otherwise you won't be able to finish the year. That's it, no more towing. Good, I'm glad you've decided to stop it. Daddy decided. What do you mean? He told the towing company he's gonna stop working. Country? Denmark. Me, too. Major city? Detroit. Dallas. Animal? DAFI: Dog. ADAM: Dolphin. Plant? DAFI: Date tree. ADAM: Daffodil. Object? [DOOR SLAMS] We must keep looking for him. I know. Why did you wait for me? I told you not to wait up for me. I went to the movies. A good story. I stayed around to see it again. This man works on a boat and his wife stays at home with the baby. And this other man comes and she falls, uh, madly in love with him. You alive or dead? Oh. I never had an accident before, never. I don't understand. I just don't understand. Everything was fine. And then, out of the blue came this little car with the lights full on, heading straight into me. I swerve to the right and there was this tree. [CHUCKLES] What happened to the other car? Nothing, maybe a scratch. Uh, two orthodox Jews from Jerusalem with the big hats. They had side curls, you know. Those real fanatics. Damn it, I'm innocent. Yeah, this is from their car. 1947 Morris. Just a piece of scrap and you can tell how old it is? Mmm-hmm. Dafi, where have you been? I've been waiting for you. I have to go to Jerusalem. Your father's there. He found a part for the Morris. Make yourself something to eat, okay? I have to run now. Say "hello" to me, Dafi. Otherwise I'll feel awful. Then why do you have to go to Jerusalem? Don't you understand? See you later, Dafi. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] MAN: Can I help you? I found this part on the street. It's from an old Morris. I want to give it back to the owner. Maybe you know him. No, I don't know him. No? Thank you. They wanted to kill me. 24 hours later, I was already in the desert. They gave me a bazooka. They really wanted to kill me. I faded at the army base in Grevia. By the afternoon I was in the Sinai with the Morris. Would you believe it? You really did a good job. [CHUCKLES] There was shelling and everything. And every minute they told me to do something else. Afterwards, I was in this jeep, full of soldiers. They were all boys. We stood for hours with full packs and helmets. And watched the explosions. Then I heard this chanting. Three men, dressed in black, with side curls and beards, jumping around, clapping their hands, handing out prayer books, skull caps, and fringe garments. They let me eat. One day, I found one of these black coats, on a rack. Someone had left it there. And when they came again, I asked if I could go with them. So then, I knew what I had to do. I hid out somewhere. And my unit forgot about me. I found the Morris. I followed them to Jerusalem. They checked if I was a Jew. And they made me the school driver. [SPEAKS SPANISH] And so equals like so. And now you'll observe... Dafne. I'm sure that your command of this material is so perfect that you can afford to gossip whilst I'm attending to the rest of the class. Why don't you come up to the blackboard and finish the equation for us? I don't know how. Ah, come on. But I don't know how. Dafne, stop arguing with me and come up to the blackboard. Dafi. Law of cosines. Asnad, another word from you and you will be thrown out of this classroom. What do you have to say for yourself now, Miss Dafne? I wish you had died instead of the gym teacher. Get out of here. Get out of here! [DOORBELL BUZZING] [SIGHS] NA'IM: It's me. I didn't think that anybody was home. Are you sick? No. Did my father send you to pick something up? Yes. No. Um... Oh, uh, I'm looking for him. He's not at the garage. He's not here? I know, he's in Jerusalem. I wanted to tell him something. Well, tell me. The old lady's dying and I quit. Quit what? My job, taking care of her. I can't do it anymore. Sit down. Are you done with the school already? I am, they kicked me out. How come? I talked back to one of the teachers. Just a second. You want something to eat? [CHUCKLES] [DOORBELL BUZZES] [CHAIR SCREECHES] [TRAIN HORN BLOWING] [DOOR LOCK CLICKS] [DOOR OPENS] [GROANS] Leave him! He came to tell you the old lady's about to die. Leave him! [GRUNTS] DAFI: Leave him! Dafi, you stay here! Let him go on his own. I told you to stay here! Stop it! What kind of father are you? [CRYING] [DOOR SLAMS] GABRIEL: Sit down. [SOBBING] Come and help me. Is there a sheet somewhere? There. Get your things. Where are you taking me now? Wherever I want to. But where? I can throw you out over the border. Why to the border? I want to go home. I trusted you. Is that how you pay me back? What did I do? Steal, murder? What did I do? You broke into my house and you took my daughter. She told me to stay. I didn't force her. She wanted to. Is this going on a long time, you and Dafi? Since this morning. Did you sleep together? I don't know. I think so. Get out. Don't ever come back. Na'im, come here. That's for school. [CAR ENGINE STARTS] What are you doing here? Waiting for you. I started to worry. Where's Dafi? She's okay. She just has to be left alone for a while. What about him? He's fine. What's he doing? He left. When is he coming back? He's not coming back. I told him it would be better if he left. Are you sure? Yes. Mmm-hmm.
