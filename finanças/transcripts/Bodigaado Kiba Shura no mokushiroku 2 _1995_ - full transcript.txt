We're too strong, so there's no one in Japan who will take us on. In order to support Daito Karate, we need money. Yes, sir. It's only polite to exchange names before a battle. Looks like two generations have lost to Daito Karate. Daito Karate never shows its back to the enemy. Then die trying. Kill him! Men... Let's have some fun. First I want to drink the blood of Kiba of Ryo... It's showtime! Cut! OK! Bring him down slowly. Give me a break! How many more times do you want to do it? Alright, let's take a break. Excuse me, where is Mr. Chen? Can't we stop for the day? I understand how you feel but the schedule is more important. It's just one more take. That's it. But... The director is a crazy asshole. Hello. I'm Kiba of the Hands of Dionysus. And I am Ryo Sakiyama. My name's Chen and I am the casting agent for Happy World movies. - Nice to meet you. - Let's get to business. OK, let's talk in the car. We have a very important actress that will be appearing in the next Happy World film. Her name is Leesyang and she's the one that needs your help. After her debut as an actress she was seen running with a rich patron named Chang who runs an acting school. A few weeks ago we got a call from him threatening to murder her. She was only an acting school student, but he brought in many people to make her famous. Here's a picture of him. But he did too much for her. His help placed him on bad terms with the school's management and spent his money up. And she became a star... After that he wasn't able to hold any steady jobs and he went from one job to another. Finally, six months ago, he entered a hospital due to his bad health. Even so, he was told that it was a cancer. Even that his condition was terminal and he had less than 6 months to live. Not being able to live with that, he ran away from the hospital. You mean that we only got a few months left? Right. We already checked out his address that he left at the hospital. And his landlord said that he came and disappeared on the same day. He disappeared from the hospital, the thing is, he left with his rifle case. He's got a rifle? Chang has been a hunter for 20 years and seems to be very proud of his hunting skill. I need you to understand, we know that this should first go to the police, but if you do, Leesyang's past will become public. Put into simple terms, a scandal that Leesyang is the cause of Chang's family's breakup. We must keep this a secret if we plan to keep her useful as a star. While on the island on location, I was given your name from a certain source and gave your Tokyo office a call. A certain source? I'm sorry, but I'm not at liberty to give you that. Let's go to Lee Leesyang. Sorry, I gotta go. If I meet a beautiful woman I can't keep going with my rehabilitation. Why? This means work. I'm gonna take charge from now on. He's a very good man. Don't worry. Goodbye. Goodbye. So, have you ever told her about the murder threat? We broke down and told her. It would be too difficult to try to guard her without her help. What is this supposed to be!? You read the script, didn't you? And this is what I get. Unbelievable. This girl is crazy. How awful for you... This way. Hi. - How is it going? - You can see for yourself... Do you think I would wear something like that? Who do you think I am? How awful for you. Leesyang, this is Mr. Ryo, an expert karate master and bodyguard. This is Miss Lee. I thought you would like to know. Stop bothering me. Being surrounded by these awful clothes is making me crazy. Then we will wait outside. Well, she's a tough one. What? What did you say? Well, I said that you are some beauty. She's been a bit on edge since receiving the death threat. That helps me a lot. Keep in mind that the location filming will take at least 10 days. I've been checking the island, using my connections to their full potential, and it seems that Chang has not entered the island so far. We hope that we can safely finish the film and be able to send you and her home. Do you want me to look ridiculous? Let's call a truce. Do you want to go through it again from the start? OK, that's enough for today! We'll resume tomorrow. Daito Karate Taiwan Branch Are you going to return to Tokyo? No, there is no dojo there. I'm gonna remain in Taipei for a while. And what about Wang Dachen? The police have him in their grasp. They can make the first move. Anyway, how are things with Leesyang? She is very beautiful and charming and I have you to thank that I'm so lucky. What's wrong? You're sulking. I've just grown up. That's all. Apocalypse of Carnage 2 Yes, they have left for the island as planned. I understand. So don't worry. You can count on Daito Karate. They are very reliable. Mr. Wang... Oh, Mr. Chang. Hello. Long time no see. Come have a seat. How long has it been? I was surprised to hear from you. I'm very embarrassed that I have to ask you for help... But I have no other choice. Please don't worry. I won't ask about your reasons. When we were young, you were in the entertainment industry and I was a businessman. We helped each other and shared our dreams with each other. Let me help you now. I won't ask what you want to do with this money. I only ask you to be successful. Thank you... Thank you. Ryo! You must be tired. It wasn't a long trip. I'm not tired. But what are you doing here? Am I bothering you two? I spoke with Master Daito and he told me to return in three days. He told me to help you while I'm here. This is my assistant, Maki. This is Miss Leesyang. I'm Maki. Nice to meet you. Hurry up, OK? Don't waste my time. "Hurry up!" What's her problem? The staff and the press believe that I am her new manager. The only ones who know about the threats are the director and the executive producer. But still... Oh well, at least I'm here to help you. Actually here is something that you could do. Oh yeah? What? This. Huh? What's this? What's this hunk o' junk? You expect me to get in this heap? Sorry, it's all that was available. Please, get in. Do you know anything about them? Yeah, they're a biker gang. They arrived a week ago. They always come at this time of the year. Hey, don't touch her. Leesyang. I shall show you to your room. I shall call as soon as dinner is ready. Mr. Lee, would you take care of this fucking press? I'm sorry, but this movie needs this advertising. Hey, go away. Hey. We are finished with our training. Good. Well done. What's wrong, sir? I mean, I thought you didn't have to worry about Wang anymore. - Isn't that true? - Why? Well, he got scared of Daito Karate's many abilities and pulled out. Our safe presence here is the best proof of that. Isn't that so? That's why I'm worried. Delicious! Thank you. Dinner will be even better... Wait, isn't today your birthday? ...It was yesterday. Yesterday? I see. Recognize anyone? No. Hello, friends. Oh, I'm sorry. My name is Huang. I'm directing this film. Hi, nice to meet you. Must be hard, huh, trying to guard Leesyang when someone trying to kill her is hiding amongst us. Well, Mr. Huang, that is our job. I know you're there. Open the door or I'm gonna break it down! Don't worry. He's a reporter for a famous weekly magazine. Well, it affects tomorrow's work, so would you leave this time? Please. Thanks. Why did you do that? You are not my guardian. Let me get one thing straight. I can't guard you unless we are as one, so stop going off on your own. We are one? That almost sounds kinky. Don't get me wrong. I mean, I have to feel the client's breath and heartbeat as mine. He's the chief in the gravure section so I thought it would be of some worth but I'm telling you that nothing happened. So then Chang was the same for you? This is the money I promised you. So you will kidnap Leesyang... And I... With my own hands, I... You loved her a lot, didn't you? No, you still love her. Hurry. I don't have much time left. It hurts... I can't breathe... Mr. Director... Mr. Director... Tell me about the next scene. The camera will pan to the ocean, then you two will come into frame. You will look at the waves, and then... Ryo. You look so serious. What are you thinking about? Let me guess. The thing that surprised you most about the shoot is all the hustle and bustle. You have to look at the camera as well as the actors and try to find the closest place from which to watch Leesyang. OK! Excellent. Perfect timing. Leave it to me. I'm a pro. What a scared face. I pity you. OK, all set! Rolling. Action! Forgive me! Cut! Meet Leesyang. Leesyang, this is Ranhuang. Nice to meet you. OK... Excuse me, miss. Where are you going? To the toilet. Want to go? I will go with you. But I don't remember any toilets on the location bus... As long as you are out of the light, every place is a toilet. I may get in the way at times, but this is a girl's job. You should be thankful that I'm here. What's wrong? Stay close to me, OK? Hello miss... How's it going? How's it going? How's it going? - Stop! - Ryo! Do you think they were after me? Well, it is safe to say he has hired professional killers. Either way, now we know that the target is on the island. What's wrong? It's so late. I can't sleep. I guess I'm too tired. Mind if I come in? Please close the door. You said that the only way you can guard me is to become one, right? That's right. Well, why don't we do that? You're getting scared now that you know Chang and his men are on the island. I don't dislike you. Thanks. How was it? What? My body. No matter how hard you try alone, you can never become a star. That's why I use my femininity as a weapon against company executives and the media. Well, I will admit that your body is some kind of a weapon. Really? Thank you. You probably think that probably happened... That I lost to that weapon. Well? Am I wrong? Miss Lee, let me tell you one thing. I could never love a woman who has no shame to do these kind of things. But the fact is, I would never get any work if I was so picky. And, uh... Would you risk your life against Chang? So the way I figure it, it would be a waste to have a woman that I slept with die on me. Then make sure that you completely guard me being that we became one and all, you son of a bitch. What a woman. After you. Leesyang. Leesyang. Ryo. I'm sorry, I can't take you to the port. But keep your eyes open. - Alright. - Say hello to the sensei for me. Mr. Lee will take me to the port. Though one thing is really annoying... What's annoying? The fact that you seem so reinvigorated. What are you talking about? Ow! "Otogi no Kuni no Birthday" is a song about a girl who wants to be a guy with a big dick. No, it's about a girl who is easily hurt. She had done it with a lot of guys before she found a true man. Huh? What are you talking about? The single by Nori-P. Have you never heard it? I've heard it. But I don't like it. Who is "Toby"? I like "Love Letter", but "Nori-P Ondo" is the best. I don't know what we were talking about anymore either. I'll tell you. "Birthday in Fairyland" is a song about a whore. She does it morning, noon, and night. How many times? A bunch! You finally manage to escape to here, when suddenly two armed men appear by those rocks. That makes you panic, and you run to hide behind there. Three cameras will be filming the scene at the same time. OK. Leesyang, we're starting! OK! Action! Cut! OK! You were great, Leesyang. Acting and timing were perfect. Leesyang. Leesyang? Where are you, Leesyang? Leesyang. Leesyang! Hey, she's not here. I can't find her. Run him over! Come out. ...Not bad. Daito Karate Headquarters Good evening. Don't get up. I'm sorry for making you wait. No, no. I'm sorry that it has taken me this much time for the investigation. And what have you uncovered? The Happy World film studio in Taiwan appears to be legitimate. We did not find anything suspicious. It is also true that Lee Leesyang, their lead actress, received threats from her former patron Chang. Nevertheless... Nevertheless? I'm worried about the fact that Wang Dachen is one of the company's financiers. Wang Dachen. Our detective agency has many sources in Taiwan. Don't misunderstand me, I'm not saying that to brag. Wang is regarded as a rich businessman but in reality he is one of the top bosses of the Taiwanese mafia. But he's not working alone in Taiwan. There are figures operating in the shadows of large businesses in every country. I don't get involved in that too much. Chang? I don't care if he kills her or not. The real target is Tetsugen Daito. I'll use Ryo to catch him... Exactly. This will force Daito to make a move. Hurry, before they finish their break. I'm counting on you. So, what's up, boys? They won't even say a word. I'm sure they are professionals. You mean hired by Chang? Mr. Lee, would you make sure the staff know the story as well as the police? We need all the help we can get. That's true. It's impossible to hide anymore. I'm sorry, but the answer is no. We can't let this cause a scandal for Leesyang. Because of just one fucking movie? That's our job. Yours is to guard Leesyang. OK? It looks like the shock was pretty strong to her. She says that she's alright. But I feel that it would be better if she took a day off. There is no other option. Well, I guess there's nothing we can do about it. We're supposed to tape the climax scene today but I guess we'll have to use a stand-in and tape her from a long distance. Stand-in? Oh yeah... Let me introduce her to you. Ranhuang! Ranhuang, this is Leesyang's manager Ryo. I heard you worked hard yesterday. It made me lose my chance. Just kidding. Well, she probably thought she can take Leesyang's place, if anything happens to Leesyang. Well, this means we got one more bitch coming. Pay attention and don't fall down. Hey, your shoe! Ranhuang is Leesyang's stand-in? It all happened in a short time. Suddenly ten huge guys came in and took her like a wave. I'm telling you. They are probably just a bunch of the roaming bikers. Probably got horny seeing the nude scene. I don't think so. What do you mean? I just can't imagine they are normal people They kidnapped her because they thought she was Leesyang. So you mean they are Huong's men? Either way they should be contacting us as soon as they find out she is not Leesyang. So you mean there is nothing we can do about it. And then we got another problem. The reporters got hurt and they say they are gonna tell the police. Mr. Lee, I think that is your job. My job is to guard Leesyang. Don't tell Leesyang about this. OK, boys? It looks like you are improving. Sensei. Hello. What are you doing here? What am I doing? Daito Karate never shows its back to the enemy, that's all. So, how is your rehabilitation going? Good. Where is Leesyang? If you bring her to us, we will release the stand-in. Well, she's just a woman. She's so scared. She collapsed a little while back. Could you give me a hand? Follow me. Tell me where she is. I don't know. You don't know? Now you feel like telling me? I'll talk. I'll talk. I'll talk. Come on. I don't want to. What do you mean? I mean, it's all her fault. She should have come. Well, let's have a party. You want to stay here? I'll let you stay here. Oh no! Leesyang has disappeared from her room! Lee and Huang were beaten up! Where are the police? If you need a report, I'll be more than happy to give you one. - So please leave. - OK. Don't worry. Shit, my head hurts. I'm sorry, he said he was a bellhop. So I opened the door. And Huong rushed in with Chang in a wheelchair. Before I passed out from the pat on the head, I heard them say that they were going to execute her at Qingshui Cliff. Yeah, I heard that too. It wasn't a mistake that they kidnapped the stand-in. They used it as a red herring. I guess they knew that I would go alone. Thanks. Tetsu Daito. How many years has it been, Wang Dachen? Somebody help me! You can't go anywhere. Finished executing Leesyang? It's not your business. Her existence alone is a crime. I don't think so. Well, it doesn't matter anymore. I make it a point to finish my job. So do I. Haven't heard your answer. Chang hasn't fired his gun yet. So I guess it hasn't happened. Maybe he's passing the time with that bitch. So I think you will be executed first. You're the one who taught me that if you're not a star for the love of it then you are not a real star. That's why I left you. To become a real star. Alright. If you insist, then I will die with you. Leesyang! Stop! Don't turn around. Please. Hello? Let's go. That's an order! That was a bit cruel, to say to a dying man that you're gonna die together. It was just an act to buy time. I was sure that you would come. You will never know. Don't forget, I'm a good actress. Goodbye. Translation by Nicholas0. Timing by arcchancellor.
