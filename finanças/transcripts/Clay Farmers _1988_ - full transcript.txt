[gentle music] [birds singing] [heavy footsteps] - Hey! [dog barking] [Gary and Randy laughing] Ow. [Dan laughing] [Gary and Randy yelling] [dog barking] - Dan! - Well, you guys wanna ride or what? [rooster calling] - We're lucky to come along. You listenin'? - Yeah, I'm listenin'. - My daddy says you're a drifter. He says Mr. Sanders should never have hired you. How come Mr. Sanders ain't around anymore? - Well, because me and Mike work his farm now. - How did you get the job? - Boy, you ask a lot of questions. We just drifted in the right place at the right time, same as Mike. - Oh. [fire crackling] Thanks Dan. - Randy, get in the house and help your momma. Son, go on and help your step brother. [fire crackling] - [Mike] Hold onto your cigarette, I've got some news for ya. - Hey. - [Mike] My folks called this mornin', my father got that cashiers job at 7/11. - Well all right. That's a hell of a change from farming, huh? - He's thrilled. He's been out of work since they got to Chicago. The best part is it'll keep his mind off the foreclosure. Says he met more people his first day on the job, than he's met in his entire life. - You ever think about going back home? - Yeah. [Mike spitting] All the time. It ain't been easy for my folks. - No, no not Chicago, Iowa. - Iowa? That ain't my home no more. Ain't nothin' but a big corporate farm. [fire crackling] - What the hell are you burnin'? - Surprise. - [Dan] In the trash barrel? - Can't ever tell where a surprise might come from. - I'm taking off for L.A. Soon as I can save a few hundred bucks. [engine rumbling] - Hell, you keep flauntin' your money like a rich man, you're never gonna leave this farm. And the owner here's a mean bastard. - I bet Sanders ain't as bad as his neighbor. - Who, Antonelli? Why, what's wrong? - The man has got somethin' against me. - He ain't got-- - Look, I know. I know when someone has got somethin' against me. What's he up to? - Sanders hired him to spray the field. [engine rumbling] [upbeat string music] [Dan and Mike yelling] [whacking] You think your father's gonna give up his new career for this? Besides, they always wanna come out to California. If you own a farm, you've gotta go where there's land, right? Well back there, farmin' ain't farmin' no more. It's big business, and the little guy gets wiped out, like we did. So I figured I'd get us some land out here instead. Ow! What the hell you do that for? - I scared you! - You damn near punctured me, is what you did. - [Dan] Hey Gary! - Hey Dan! My daddy said I could help you. - Good, then keep out of the way. [whacking] [Gary yelling] [Dan laughing] - All right Gary, that's one. [upbeat harmonica music] Bet you we're gonna be done by noon. - [Gary] See why you don't got no sickle for me. - Job wasn't so bad now, was it? [whacking] What the hell'd you do that for? - You saw him aiming at the bottle. - I didn't think he'd hit it. - Good shot, Gary. [laughing] - Shut up, Dan. Gary, put that rock down! - [Dan] What happened to your neck? - I falled. - [Mike] You fell. - I felled. - [Mike] Come on Dan, let's get to work. - Hey, hey it's not your fault. Shouldn't be ashamed. If your daddy starts hittin' you again-- - Gary! Get the hell up here! Get over here. Get over here! [whacking] [Gary screaming] - Hey Dan, you're starting to look like a farm boy. [patrons laughing] - Trapper. Why don't you give me five regulars? How're you doing? - Frank said he heard some gun shots comin' from up your way. You guys tryna get that deer? - No, Mike hunked some blood meal up on the fence. They don't get in the orchard no more. - Blood meal, I'd have shot him. - Trapper, you couldn't shoot a deer if it walked in, and sat down, and ordered itself a drink. - [laughs] That shotgun has seen its day. Broken up many fights in here. Dan, have a drink on Carl. [patrons laughing] - Thanks Carl. - I'll get and go. - I'll take this. - To friends. [glasses clinking] [cash register ringing] - I'll come shoot that deer. - Sure you will. All Dan's gotta do is ask your wife if you can stay out after nine. [men laughing] - Don't take it hard, Billy. Rick's just teasing you, because his wife don't want him comin' home at night. - Yeah. Yeah. [patrons laughing] - Frank, your ugly cousin's here. - Jim, good to see you, boy. Good to see you. - Don't get on his bad side. - I don't think he's got another side. - Shake some coin. - Yeah. [patrons laughing] - Barking up the wrong tree or what?

Don't listen to your step momma. Open the door for your daddy, Gary. Open the God damn door! You're my boy, Gary. You're my boy. Open the door, son. Let your old man in. Let your daddy in, son. Let him in. [Jim panting] Open the door, bitch! [glass smashing] - We ain't opening the door, Jim! Randy, get Gary back in his room. Not until you're sober. - Open the God damn door! - Gary, get away from the door. Just get away Jim. Just leave us alone. Jim, let go of Randy! Jim, let go of-- - Shut up, woman! [glass smashing] - Randy! [peacock calling] [crow cawing] Randy! You up there? [stone banging] [gunshot firing] Randy! [peacock calling] Randy? Get up. Come on Randy. Stop playing. Wake up. [gentle music] [Dan laughing] - No! [laughing] [Mike laughing] [gentle music] - Hey Gary. Gary, I'm gonna go on over to finish Sanders' field. Do you wanna come help me? Don't listen to what your step momma's been sayin', she's just upset. Come on son, the funeral's tomorrow. We've gotta put this thing behind us. - I didn't do it. - It was an accident, that's all. - [Jim] But I didn't do it. - Come on, let's get the truck. - This is a small town, and you've gotta live with people like Antonelli. You're an outsider. Don't start making enemies with him. - I'm not planning on living in this town. - Fine. My contract says I've gotta work here another two months, and I'd just as soon not have any problems. No problems, okay? - I'm easy. - Maybe it would make more sense for you to keep working while I'm still here. That way you wouldn't be strapped when you go down to L.A. - Look, I've always gotten by one way or another. - You wander around like you're lost. - I just don't wanna be a farm hand forever. - I ain't talkin' about being a farm hand, I'm talkin' about belongin'. - You know what land costs. You're kiddin' yourself, you think you're ever gonna own a farm. I'm just sayin', this farm isn't anymore my home than L.A. could be. - Forget it. You don't even know what I'm talkin' about. Pick up the tools. - [Dan] What's your problem? - You can be a real asshole, Dan. - Can I ride with you? - Nope. - Why not? - [Jim] 'Cause you're gonna stay in the truck. - Can I go help Mike and Dan? [glass smashing] - I don't wanna catch you around those two, now you hear me? [engine rumbling] - [Mike] It's true what you said, about buying a farm. - Yeah, well I shouldn't have been mean about it. - Did I tell you I was thinkin' of going down to Los Angeles myself, once? - No. - When you mentioned the other day that you were thinkin' about going down there, it just got me thinkin' again. Never lived in a city before. - Well, it's different than a place like here. - Maybe we should think about goin' together. - That's possible. - I might have to meet you there or somethin'. - [Dan] Or I could stay, help you finish up your work here. Maybe we could travel a little bit first, see the coast and all. - Yeah! [Gary squeaking] [Dan laughing] - Hey Gary. How you doin', little man? - [Mike] Hey Gary, did your daddy say you could come here? - Yeah! - You here to pick? - Tell him he's too little. - I am not. I can pick faster than you. - [Mike] Cannot. - Can too! - What you been cryin' about? - I ain't been cryin'. - Stop lyin', cry baby. - I ain't lyin'. - Hey Gary, you wanna go swimmin'? - I don't got no bathing suit. - Well it doesn't matter, because no one's gonna see us. - [Mike] We still gotta finish cleaning the road today. - No problem. Now with Gary helpin', we're gonna get it done in next to no time. Come on, I'll race ya. [Dan laughing] [upbeat music] [Dan cheering] [water splashing] [Dan yelling] How come your brother doesn't come to work with you and your daddy? - 'Cause he and daddy don't never get along. - Why not? - 'Cause. - 'Cause of why? - 'Cause he don't like it when daddy gets mad. - Why does he always hit you? You do stuff to get him mad? - I guess. - What do you say we go up stream, I wanna go fishing this afternoon. - I'll go get my pole. - You don't got a pole. - Yeah I do. 'Cause I got all of Randy's stuff. - That's just a plain ol' pocket knife. - It's Randy's. - [Mike] Then you stole it. - I did not, it's mine. - [Mike] Come on. - It is too, 'cause Randy got killed. - [laughs] Liar. - What do you mean? - It was a rifle accident, yesterday. - Who shot him? - Nobody. It was an accident. My step momma don't have no right to say it was my fault. I wasn't even there. - It wasn't your fault. - My daddy don't believe me either. He just got mad at me and told me to shut up. Then he started yelling, because he said I shouldn't talk about it, but I didn't do it! - Get your hands off my boy! Gary, get up here! - Dan, let go of him. - [Jim] Gary, right now! - This ain't your place to interfere, Dan, let go of him! - Don't tell my daddy nothin' what I said. - Get your clothes on Gary and get up here! Right now! What those boys do to you, Gary? - They didn't do nothin'. - Don't lie to me, I seen it from up here! [seagulls squawking] - Forget about the kid. - Don't tell me who the hell to think about. I mean you don't even know what Gary's going through, do you? All you see are just marks on his skin. His brother didn't kill himself because of that. You don't even think about the marks he's got on the inside, do you? - Of course I do. - Nah. All you see is just some dumb kid who wants to hang around, get in your God damn way. It's not why he's around. You know what it's like to get hit every day, have to make up stories about where those scars came from, huh? You don't get over it. You carry it your whole God damn life. Last time I saw my dad, he had his God damn hands around my neck, and he kept choking me, pounding my head in the ground. Blaming me for making my mother leave. "I'm gonna kill you" he kept sayin', "It's your fault". - I'm sorry. - He don't even know what he's being hit for. [Dan crying] I guess sitting here crying ain't gonna help, huh? - Sure it helps. What do you say we get cleaned up and go out? [gentle upbeat music] - Your wife's folks gonna make it to the funeral, Jim? - It's too long a drive, I don't think so. [gentle upbeat music] They're faggots, your friends. They're a couple of God damn faggots. Come across them when I was looking for my boy this afternoon. - What'd you see? - Jim, tell 'em about what they'd done to Gary. - [Jim] They tried to get Gary to go with 'em, all right. They told Gary, if he didn't go with 'em, they'd beat him up. - [Billy] Maybe it wasn't what you'd thought. - [Frank] He told ya, he'd seen it with his own two eyes. - Hell, we've all known Dan and Mike, ever since they got here. - What are you getting at, Billy? - Nothin'. Just-- - You standing up for them, after what they tried doin' to Gary? - [Man] You knew all along about them two, didn't you, Billy? - I didn't know nothin' about it, about them two, I mean. Except. - Except what? - What are you so nervous about, Billy? - You mean that they're faggots? You see Jim, I told you he knew about 'em. - Leave the guy alone. [engine rumbling] - Well, sounds like your friend's come to pay their dues. - What's going on, Frank? - I don't want no part in your problem. - What problem? Billy, what's happenin'? - I don't know. - I don't got no problems with you, Antonelli. - [Jim] To hell you don't. - Look, if we all gotta work something out, we can just-- - Ain't nothin' to work out. Just something to settle. - Dan, let's get goin'. - We just caught you. You ain't going nowhere. - Sit. - You caught us for what, damn it? - [Jim] For what you tried to do to Gary. - Sober up. - Where you goin'? - Don't try and lie about it, even Billy said you two was queers. - That ain't. That ain't. That ain't. - What the hell? - We said don't lie about it, faggot. I seen it with my own eyes. - You're lying, Antonelli. Only thing you seen all day was the bottom of a God damn whiskey bottle. [punching] [glass smashing] [groaning] [gunshot firing] - The next shot ain't a blank, and I ain't about to put no holes in my ceiling. You got a dispute to settle? Do it somewhere else. [Dan panting] - You okay, buddy? Come on. - If I ever see either one of you again, I'll kill you! You hear me? I'll kill you! - How's the cut? - It's stopped bleedin'. - Keep holdin' it there, it'll keep the swellin' down. Feels like it's gonna rain, huh? Be good for the trees, getting too much dust on the leaves. That's what happened on the folk's farm, didn't rain. Can't predict that though. I mean you can't tell if there's gonna be a drought or not. Give me a drag. - Just light your own. - This whole thing will blow over. It's just a misunderstanding, that's all. - Right, well who in the God damn hell told Billy to turn on us, huh? Frank. Who told Frank just to sit there and watch? - Come on. We'll straighten it out. We've only got another couple of months here, and then-- - Oh, is that the way you see it, huh? We just go back to what we explained to everyone, that was just a God damn mistake, that we're all still friends. - Come on, it was a misunderstanding. We've gotta clear it up, right? - The hell we do. - What else are we gonna do? Hide out here like a couple of scared animals? Come on Dan. - Just. Just keep your hands off of me. [birds singing] [rooster calling] [chickens clucking] - Here's a present I made for you. Clay's from the mountain. - I came for my cheque. - Your cheque? - My paycheck. Takin' off. - Why? There's a lot we gotta do still. We can't just leave. - I'm goin' alone. - Dan, you can't just leave, just take off. It was lies, Dan. It was all lies. - Just lies? - And why are you runnin' away from this town? - Just get me my God damn paycheck. - It ain't our fault, Dan. Can't you believe in nothin'? [engine rumbling] Dan? [gentle music] - [Priest] Peace, I leave with you. My peace, I give unto you. As the world giveth, give I unto you. [gentle music] Like as a father pitied his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him. As one whom his mother comforteth, so I comfort you, and ye shall be comforted. Unto the mercy of almighty God, we commit our dearly departed to the ground. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in the shore and certain hope of eternal resurrection.
