'Tis not alone my inky cloak, Mother. No. Nor customary suits of solemn black, nor windy suspiration of forced breath. No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, nor the dejected 'haviour of the visage, together with all forms... - Lukas? - Yes? - Sorry. - Yes? Try to pause less. It's an unusual situation, it gets a bit fast. But I have to see what's going on, see how I react. See what's going on? You just want to tear them to pieces. She's fucking your dad's brother! - I get it. - Let's do it again. Take thy fair hour, and thy graces spend it at thy will. But now, my nephew Hamlet, and my son... What is he... whose grief bears such an emphasis? Whose phrase of sorrow conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I, Hamlet, King of Danes. Sven! Hi. Don't come too close. I have cancer. I thought I saw a ghost. You look good. You haven't put on weight. The wig is from "The Little Prince"? Yes. Are you back? Can you perform? Ask the director. I'm ready. If it be now, 'tis not to come. If it be not to come, it will be now. If it be not now... yet it will come. The readiness... ...is all. You're looking better. Thanks to my great donor. Looks like the transplant did you good. I don't get it, it's counterproductive. Why does he mess with me? It pisses me off, to have to play like you. Don't worry. If I can't act freely, it's no fun. You know him, he needs a scapegoat. Screw it. You like this one? Or this one from Tartuffe. - Copy and paste isn't my thing. - I like the blue one. Have you written something? If it's any good, I'll take it. I've got nothing at the moment. This 25-year-old author... has already written three plays. See, you don't need me at all. What does he think? How will that work? He's doing much better. Look at him. He'll never make it. You saw him. On stage he's someone else. He won't last fifteen minutes. He has to rest, that's all. Lisa, opening night is in a month. This is not a new production, it's a rerun. How often has he done this play? 200, 250 times? 357 times. Give him a few days and then try. You're as stubborn as your brother, right? He's on stage for three hours. And the fight scenes. You risk nothing, you have Lukas. Lukas is brilliant, but no understudy. Because you stage him as Sven. The worst for an actor. I can't redo the whole staging. It would take months. That would be a huge problem. Am I boring you? We haven't met in three years and you're already avoiding me. Missing Switzerland? The mountains? Fresh air? Heidi? Are you happy? Very. And you? Yes. Very happy. He just said you should rest. I don't want to. I want to rehearse. You have three weeks. I didn't get a transplant to watch my understudy. Such an asshole! You're sure you want to go there? No choice. I can't be alone at night. And Johannes? Johannes... it's over. He's in Hamburg, he plays every night. Hamburg isn't far away... It was short and good. It's over. It's open! - Hello. - There you are. - Mom... - I'll be right there. What's this mess? I just asked you to dust a bit. Exactly. What's this? You forced me to clear out, so I found all that stuff. I didn't force you. Your father left me archives and photos. And a bunch of costumes in the cellar. Sell them at the flea market, collectors might be tempted. You kids have no idea what a life we had. We only worked with the best ones. Brecht... Zadek, Peter Stein, Gr√ºber... Here, I found them. Lisa, look. Lisa, you'll like this. Come here! God, I got old. Nonsense, you haven't changed. How lovely, look. The premiere of "A Man's a Man." You were so cute. You've kept these? We were babies. David. He hasn't changed either. I don't get why you left him. - You were such a beautiful couple. - Mom... You're too demanding. I always loved your father, but don't ask a theatre artist to be faithful his whole life. And I'm not a doormat. - You're exaggerating. - No. No wish to wonder every night who he's sleeping with. - Unlike you, I still have plans. - And? What are your plans? Writing one masterpiece after another? Who cares? You don't like my writing. It's not that I don't like it, I never understood the success of this play. Sven was amazing, but the text... You hate it, you said it a thousand times. The title alone, "Amniotic," what does that even mean? The spleen of a petty bourgeois who feels out of sorts, that's luxury problems. For you, theatre ends with Brecht. Political theatre. Are you insane? I do believe in political theatre. Your father always said... Hello, sweetie! Theatre can't change the world... Guys, can you smell burning? Shit! No, I'm listening. I come back tomorrow. Grandma's here. She sends kisses. Hand me the knife. No, the bread knife. Can you put Dad on? And a pot for the chocolate. Okay, honey. I'll melt it. Put Dad on. Sven loves this. So hot! No, Lisa. Don't eat that, it's disgusting. And far too hot. - Watch out. You're cutting it all. - Nonsense. - You're cutting... - I'm not cutting anything! Run through my lines? Stop. You're torturing yourself. How is my good Lord Hamlet? I'm well, thank you. Act 2, scene 2, page 17. Go seek him there. He will stay till ye come. Act 4, scene 2, bottom of page 44. Hamlet, this deed which we do tender... Hold on. This isn't Hamlet, the king says this. I know it all by heart. Even Ophelia. Any idea how fucking boring a sterile room is? I say, we will have no more marriages, those that are married, all but one, shall live, the rest shall keep as they are. - To a nunnery, go. - I say it differently. Of course. What comes next? His magical vows were like music to me, I sucked them like honey. Now see that noble and most sovereign reason, like sweet bells jangled, out of tune. Mom, don't forget, two protein drinks a day. He barely eats. They're full of calories. No, you promised me. Sven is not even here. That's his medicine for the next three weeks. Make sure he takes them daily. Where's your diary? For the medical appointments. You don't go through a lady's purse. This week is easy, one appointment with the dermatologist. Thursday at 3pm. I'll write it down. Next week, the hematologist. And important, Wednesday 10am, his physician. Way too early. No. Cut down on your sleeping pills. Nothing before noon. I can't change this appointment. It's his interim review. Shit! Sven? Fucking roller skates! - Are you okay? - Who the fuck put them here? I had no time to put them away. I found a stuffed toy in the boxes, your old teddy bear. This is not a flat, it's an obstacle course. You want me to break my neck when I go pee? Don't shout like that! It's unbearable! I can't take care of myself, how shall I do with you? I never asked you to! I just want my peace! I do my best! But this is hell! Look at you, you give me the creeps. Look at yourself. You're a mess. Depressing. Because you make me sick! But I'll tell you this, I can't stand watching you waste away like this, I'd rather die! You have no right to do this to me! No right! God! I do my best... Is that him? No, he's not flying today. Hello? Is this the hematology unit? Yes. I called this morning for my brother Sven Braunschweig. Dr. Eberhardt. In Berlin. He sent over his file. Your man doesn't pick you up at the airport? You're so sweet. Sorry? No need to move everything around. We have enough space. You didn't progress, right? Yes, I did. The first row of post-its is still the same. The masturbation scene is new. I'm sick of stories about frustrated couples... who rip each other apart... and explore their sexuality to escape boredom. I'm tired of it. I think it's interesting. That was another life, it's not me anymore. I want to do something else. I think it's interesting. Flat. - You're not flat. - Stop it. - Where's Mommy? - I'm here. I missed you. Did you go skiing? Was it nice? - Where's Sven? - Who's Sven? Where's Sven? No idea. Shall we look for him? Is he under the table? In the shoes? No. Who's that? Sven! See, you recognize him. - Hello. - Get closer. Is that real hair? Of course. It's my mane. Careful! Hello, Sven. Leave my sister alone! Linne-Lu, Noah, come! I'm running a bath. I'll eat you up! Bath time, Noah. Save me from this bad guy! So? Everything okay? Had a good trip? Yes. I'll make some space for you. No need, I can manage. How long are you staying? 2-3 weeks? As short as possible, don't worry. You'll rest well here. Leysin is famous for its sanatoriums. It was the place for tuberculosis patients, on long recovery cures. Until the vaccine discovery. Are you eating with us? What are you doing? Sven is sleeping next door. And? Should we go to a hotel? What's this? Noah had a bad dream. I'll take it to him. It doesn't matter. - What if he wakes up? - Leave it. No, I'll just get... - Master, what authority. - Head Master... Head Master, sorry. - Shall I get my school uniform? - Let's skip foreplay. For my brother, Sven Braunschweig. I called yesterday. Yes, exactly. Oh, you speak German. Even better. I'm not familiar with medical terms. Sorry? Two rounds of chemo. And a bone marrow transplant. Sorry I have to hang up now, can I call you back later? Thank you. Bye. Five years is far too long. Five years is the minimum. We must reach a new clientele. Koreans, Chinese, they've worked hard to get where they are. It takes time to create projects for their kids. You know it's complex. Yes, I know. We always said we'd go back to Berlin. That was the deal. I come here with you, but then we go back. And we will. I want that too. Dinner is ready. Lisa, this school is in the world's top ten. Do you realize that? Save your breath for your sponsors. There's nothing in Berlin. At least not at that level. I need time... I need to think about it. - I have plans too. - What kind of plans? You can write anywhere, right? Writers can work anywhere. Or do you have other plans? When is the deadline? No idea. - Soon. - How soon? I'm first on the list until they open to other candidates. No worries, we'll work it out. Dinner! - Not hungry. - Me neither. Noah, let's eat! Linne-Lu. Now. What question? I asked you to compare "Letters to a Young Poet" with "Sonnets to Orpheus." Quite simple. We spent two months analyzing classic poetry. - I'm fed up with Rilke. - I can tell. God, it's quiet here. Restful. Scary. There's one street in this dump. How can you stand it? Will David like this? No. Or that? Don't worry, he won't forget you. Your writing is good. Your texts are good. Especially the short stories. Did you snoop around my computer? The short story with the... boarding school kid who deals codeine and talks in rhymes in his head. It's really good. No, it sucks. You should make a play of it. Or a monologue in Alexandrine. Who writes in Alexandrine today? Stop bugging me. I quit writing. I know, since June 3rd. How do you know? I don't know it myself. Because you date all your texts. Plus, it was the day I was diagnosed. Hello. We were at the Ruhr Theatre Festival with "Measure for Measure" when I got the results. - Is that all? - Yes. 17.70, please. "Myeloid," the doctor said. We didn't know that word. He gave me a few months. A really severe case. But we did well. We did really well. - Thank you. - Goodbye. Switzerland doesn't stop you from writing. June 3rd does. Let's go, I can't stand this dump. May I ask Her Highness what her favorite color is? Blue, of course. Royal blue? Yes. Let me place this royal blue crown... Of course, my Lord. Sleep well, pumpkin. Can you read "Hansel and Gretel?" No, it's too late. Tomorrow. - Shall we sing? - Yes. Now let us sing the evening song and pray that God watches over us. Many eyes are crying every night, until the sun awakes tomorrow. It's weird... Mom singing us that song, when we're a family of atheists. What are atheists? Nothing. They're people who don't believe in anything. Sleep well, my little stars. After death... People who believe there's nothing after death. Sleep well. Give him some space. If you text him every hour, he'll go mad. No messages in 12 days. Something's wrong. An actor shouldn't force desire, but create it. Come clear your head! Here, put on your jacket. - Is your eczema back? - No, it's just nerves. Have you got a cream? Corticosteroids? I told you it's nothing! I should try your miracle drops... Go downstairs to daddy. Four drops every hour. Under the tongue for 30 seconds. There's alcohol in it. Cheers! And I'm cured. You drank the whole bottle? Asshole. Sorry. Watch out! Not bad, right? Looks great. What's up in that dump? Nothing. I feel like I'm in a sanatorium. I sleep healthy, eat healthy, shit healthy. Seriously... I'm bored to death. I wait for your okay and I'm out of here. Sven, I have to tell you... I saw a documentary about Leysin's sanatoriums. What if Hamlet had tuberculosis? And got back from a cure with this new gesture, gymnastics in eurythmy style. There's been changes, we won't start as planned. Really? Why? Did you move the dates? No, it's not that. Then what? I'm in deep shit, I had to make a decision. We must call the whole thing off. What? I had to drop "Hamlet," we're doing "Beware of Pity" instead. It's going well, and the actors still have it. You can't be serious. We're doing "Hamlet." I'm ready. I don't understand... And what about Lukas? Lukas is not a problem. He wasn't happy anyway. Lukas plays whenever I can't, we agreed on this. I put "Hamlet" on with you. If I ever do it again, then only with you. I'm sorry. There's no other way. You're too weak. David, I'm fine. I'm on top form. Don't delude yourself. You might make it to the premiere and then you'll collapse. I want to save you that, and save us that. Sven, it's a marathon, I can't take that risk. Sven. I'm sorry, I had no other choice! Sven, talk to me. Come back, please. I've got snow in my boots. Sven isn't here! What? He's not here! - Are you sure? - Yes. How come? Let's go check. I don't understand. He's not answering. He needs to clear his head. He's never like this. Give him some space. Don't always imagine the worst. Can you hurry up a bit? Can't you go alone? No. It's Sunday. I need one day without obligations. Excuse me to Bob, he'll understand. All wives are invited. Pull yourself together. Exactly. That's why I fucking want to get out of here. Every day you have to pull yourself together. What's with you? You sound like your brother. Sven? Wait. What the hell? What the fuck? Get out! Piss off! It's absurd! They can go to school for free in the best conditions. To then have what kind of life? What friends? Oligarchs' sons? Daughters of Qatari tycoons? If they take the chance, they'll have great opportunities. You can't get a better network. They won't be able to afford it. This isn't us! Listen, we can't miss this one-off chance, just because you're in bad shape. - In bad shape? - Yes, in bad shape. You didn't even try to get a job in Berlin. I? I applied to two boarding schools. What did you do? Did you look for a job? No. Because it's easy, it takes three calls to teach in Berlin. You'll get a part-time job in a crappy school. To feed the family, you better write a best-seller. You never talked about money before. I don't want to live in a shabby 2-bed apartment, when we can have it all here. I'll go back then and you stay here. Like a modern couple. Right? Are you being serious? Yes. It works, other people do it. And the kids? I don't know. We'll go back and forth. No way. Do you want me to run the school here and be a full-time dad? I'll take them. And you visit whenever... Are you joking? I want to see them grow up! Every day, not just on holidays! Shit, Lisa! I'm not a weekend dad. I never said that! Sven! What have you done? What have you done now? What? I love you, little sister. I love you too. I love you too. Do you need anything? You're my little sister, right? Yes. Because you were born two minutes after me. You're right, two minutes means a lot. I have to look after you. - Is he okay? - He's sleeping like a log. Lisa? Remember that weird hotel in Rome? Yes. With those funny madonnas everywhere. We should go back there. I'll check if they have rooms left. We just drop everything and leave. Yes? We leave the kids with Jenny, it won't be the first time. I don't know, Martin... Let's talk about it tomorrow. - Will you eat your bread? - Yes. - And you, finish your Muesli. - Not hungry. - Linne-Lu, eat something. - I'm not hungry! - You'll be hungry later. - I'm not going to school. - Of course you are. - No, I'm not! - We all go to school. - It's boring! I have no time for this now. You like school! We learn nothing, it's so boring! And your dance class, you love it! I don't want to! Then you'll see your friends on the playground. What will you do here all day long? I stay here with Sven! Take that headscarf off. I want to stay with Sven! What are you doing here? Surprise. How are you? Are you sure about this? I'm a bit hungover, but... It's not that hard, is it? No, it's not. You just have to run, I'll do the rest. All clear? Okay. Just concentrate on one thing: run straight ahead, pick up speed, and don't stop. - Right? - Yes. One... Two... Three. Go! Faster! Speed up! Speed up! What's this mountain? That's the Mont d'Or. Next to it, Pic Chaussy. And back there, the Diablerets glacier. Shit. What? - Are you okay? - I feel dizzy. I feel dizzy. Focus on the horizon. - I want to go down. - Already? Yes, I want to go down. I wanted to show you Lake Bretaye, to see mountain goats... - Sven, what are you doing? - I'm scared! No! Don't do that! - Don't touch that. - I feel dizzy! Let go, Sven! Calm down. Take a deep breath. Calm down. - I can't breathe. - Let go, do you hear me? Man... You freaked me out. Sven? Say something. Sven? Shit, Sven! Wake up! Madam. Your mask. Your mask. No, he had a bad night. Corticosteroid therapy. Stop torturing yourself. No, Martin, it's really not your fault. His body is rejecting the transplant. Madam? You need change. - What? - It takes coins. Oh, yes, I forgot... Sorry. You want one? Yes. Thank you. Thank you very much. Better. He took a few steps this morning. It's not clear yet... Induction therapy. Then more chemo... I have to go back in now. A big kiss to the kids, okay? - Sugar? - No... Yes. Thank you so much. David? I'm so sorry. I took the first flight. I feel like shit. Sven, I am so sorry. It's all my fault, I should have done it differently. Wait... I wish it all happened differently. Did you call him? Mom. She didn't want to come. Fear of flying. A train would have worked too. Typical Mom. Yummy. Nicely burnt. Here... You shouldn't, you'll get cancer. Try it. Delicious. The icing... Always the best part. The more burnt the cake, the thicker the icing. You can't? Spit it. Spit it out. What can I do for him? Call him often, talk about his role. I can't do that. Pretend like... Like what? Pretend like what? Didn't he tell you? Tell me what? What's with these stupid secrets? There are no secrets. I dropped the play, I thought he told you. You tell each other everything. What? I called him on Sunday, he didn't tell you? Last Sunday? You can't do that. You're both putting me in an awful position. This is painful for me too. I've got a theatre to fill. We're doing "Beware of Pity" again. What? It's the easiest solution. Same cast. Lukas plays the lead role. He prefers that anyway. It was a crazy idea to keep the play, because I hoped Sven would be back. I'm sorry, there is no best solution. You're pathetic. - I had no choice. - Sure you had a choice! No, I didn't. I saw how sick he was. I didn't want to tell you, but I can't let him die on stage. I want to spare us that! - You don't get it. - I get it very well. Sven and I created countless plays together, we spent thousands of hours rehearsing, chasing for the craziest ideas. But to let a dying actor perform... It's obscene. Sorry, but it's perverse. Why did you come? You don't belong here. Lisa! Sven, what is it? What's wrong? Are you okay? It hurts so much... What? Are you thirsty? Some water? Wait... This will cool you down. Sven... It hurts so much. Where does it hurt? Everywhere. It will be okay. Take a deep breath. Sven! Breathe. Calm down. Stay calm. Calm! They'll be right here. Breathe deeply. Nurse! I buzzed! Please! Room 301! Stay calm, try to stay calm. Breathe. I want to go home. Okay, I'll take you home. And I'm going to write something... I'm going to write for you. - For me? - Yes, I'll write for you. But you have to get well to go back on stage. Promise me! A play... A play, yes. A monologue. A dialogue. I'll write you a dialogue. Brother and sister. I'll write you... "Hansel and Gretel." Remember the fairy tale? But for adults... "Hansel and Gretel"? The woods... Yes, they're alone in the woods, abandoned by their parents. And they find the gingerbread house. - All alone... - Yes, they're all alone. But they find the little house. With the chocolate roof... and candy cane pillars. And then there's the witch... Bitch... Yes, the witch is a bitch... And Gretel becomes her slave, but she tries everything to save her brother. Sven, stay with me. - Everything okay? - No! Stay with me. It's okay... He's here now. I'll call the doctor. -We'll increase the Oxynorm. -Okay. You'll be fine... Breathe, Sven. The doctor's coming. It's okay. Yes... It's okay. I had a long talk with your hematologist, Dr. Eberhardt in Berlin. He had high hopes for the bone marrow transplant... But it didn't work out. As I said, it can happen... Even with twins. What do we do now? Well... We have two options left. Either we continue the treatment with immunosuppressive corticosteroids. But as you know, the side effects are quite severe. And your condition is not great. I couldn't feel better, Doctor. I can see that. Given your Olympic shape, I'd rather go with the second option, an extracorporeal photopheresis. Photopheresis? It's an immunomodulatory treatment. We take immune cells from you, Mr. Braunschweig, we treat them and reinject them into your body. But you might not like that, as it involves several weeks of hospitalization, in a sterile room... And Dr. Eberhardt mentioned your fondness for sterile rooms. And if we drop everything, what happens then? They were dying to visit him, I had to fight. Sven wanted too, but the nurses would have killed me. - There. - Thank you. I found a substitute for you. She takes over your class for the semester. Good. What's her name? I can't remember, she came recommended. She's from Hamburg. Thanks. I'll call her. - Want one? - Yes. Lisa, I... I signed. I said yes. What? I had to make a decision. I had competitors. I had to hurry. We should talk first, we have to decide together! I wanted to, but you were in the hospital. I understand, but I couldn't reach you. I had no choice. You could have come, Lausanne isn't far! Your mind was elsewhere... I didn't want to bother you. This is about us, you can't decide alone! Lisa, I'm doing this for us. You hate me now, but later you'll see things differently. I know this feels overwhelming... You can't do this. But you're not yourself right now. Trust me. You'll see, I'm right. I've never been more myself, Martin. Never. Get out, pumpkins. What a surprise! - Linne-Lu needs to pee. - Unbelievable. And they're hungry too. You had a good flight? - Yes. - I need to pee. Go ahead. - Can I help? - The small suitcase, please? - Yes. - Would be great. Go ahead, door is on the right. Can you let me through, please? Are you thirsty? Syrup, I must have syrup somewhere. - Do you like strawberry syrup? - Yes. Yes, I've got some. Lisa, fancy a kir? Mom... Not a good time for an aperitif. Do you have any food? You should have told me you were taking the kids. I'd have gone shopping. - Do you like rollmops? - Rollmops? Grandma? Can you put some water in it? - How much? - A little. You wanted lots of it. - That's good. - Oops, that's too much. Hello? Johannes? Hello. Sorry. Of course, Johannes! Of course. I remember you. Are you still playing in Hamburg? Sven told me it's a huge success. Congratulations. Yes... Yes, I know. No, Sven would love to see you. But we're... in Switzerland. That's normal, his phone is often off. That's sweet. I know... I'll tell him. I don't want him to see me like this. You're unique. Lots of friends want to see you. You're loved. - Are we still in Switzerland? - Yes. - You sure? - Yes. I'll take your temperature. Want one too? Everything okay? What are you writing? Children's Games. What's it about? "Hansel and Gretel." The Grimm's fairy tale? Weird idea... Is it for David? Leave it. Hello? - Mom! - Who is this? Ah, Martin! How are you? No, it's the mother. The old pain in the neck. No, she can't talk to anyone. Not even to me. - I'm just fresh air to her. - Mom, give me the phone. The kids? Yes, they're here. They're not asleep yet. Do you want to talk-- Martin? Lisa! What's this letter? Are you kidding me? You write me letters now? You won't talk to me? You won't listen to me! I don't listen to you? Of course, I do. But you're not talking! Don't say you're in Berlin for Sven! You took the whole family and I'm the last one to find out! I'm the last one to find out. You decide about our future! We live together! You're the one kidding me! You just took the kids! Have you lost your mind? They wanted to stay with Sven, and see their Grandma. Bullshit, Lisa! You want to blackmail me! Your brother is dying, I don't want our children to watch that! My brother is not dying! He'll be back on stage soon, and the kids wanted to come! On stage? Are you losing it? I don't want them to see that. Bring Linne-Lu and Noah back home now! The fun is over. I know what I'm doing. You're losing it! I'd never have taken my brother paragliding. That's insane, you almost killed him! Now give me a break, leave me alone! Hi. What are you doing here? I thought you were in Switzerland. I'm just here to pick up his medication. There. You've got some nerve. I thought you didn't want to see me again. Children's Games? It's a start. The first 30 pages. Still a lot to do, but you'll get an idea. It's based on "Hansel and Gretel." The connection between the two children... This feeling of complete lostness. They're lured away, then betrayed... I'm interested in that. I don't get it. You want me to stage "Hansel and Gretel"? Just read it. It's not as naive as it sounds. It won't take much effort. Two rehearsals at most. I don't have much time. You can do it in the studio, in the foyer. I'll let you know, okay? It's simple. It's a monologue. A mono-dialogue with a recorded voice. - A kind of inner journey... - I can't, I've told you! David, this is not "Hamlet"! It lasts an hour tops. Sit him on a chair and he reads the text. It's that simple! Lisa, I'm swamped right now. These last-minute changes throw everything off. This is about Sven! About Sven! Promise me you'll do this play with him! He's filled this theatre for years. It's the least you can do! You don't want to understand. - As stubborn as before. - No, you don't understand. An actor who feels wanted, feels alive. If you take that desire away from him you're killing him faster than any illness could. I'm sorry. What are you making? Apple strudel? We haven't had one in ages. Can you give me a hand? Linne-Lu and Noah are playing outside? No, they're out. As Martin is here, we could eat together... Martin is here? Not here, they went out. To the zoo. No, to the aquarium. The fish are amazing. It will do them good, they're so hyper. It's too much for me. - I can't stand it anymore. - Give me your keys. Give me your car keys! God knows where they are... No, I want a chocolate first. You'll get one on the plane, okay? Really? Yes... Or are you joking? There you go. Let's get out, Noah. I don't want to. Are you coming, Linne-Lu? Take your bag. When is mom coming? She looks after Sven. She'll come tomorrow. And Sven? No idea. Soon. Come on now. I don't want to. We're getting on the plane. Can you help me a little? But I don't want to! Come on. Hurry up! Lisa, don't freak out, he'll be back. Shut up, you don't know him. When he gets stubborn... I knew it... He's taken their passports. That bastard! Bastard! Hello? I'd like to report a child abduction... Lisa Nielsen... My children! My two children! He's kidnapped them! My husband! He's taken their passports. He's taking them to Switzerland, what should I do? Tall, blond, thin... Nielsen, Martin Nielsen... Mom! What is he wearing? Lisa, come here... - You saw him last. - I'm telling you to come here! Look. What did I tell you? Hello! - Is everything okay? - Yes. We went to the airport. - Is Dad with you? - Downstairs. Go on upstairs! Grandma's made some food. Martin... Stay here! We have to talk. You can't just leave like that! You have to calm down. - Lisa, I'm sorry. - Don't tell me you're sorry! You all say you're sorry! You have no idea! You have no idea! Fuck off! I hate you! I hate you all! Shit! Shit! Shit! Fuck you all... You can all fuck off... High in the trees, the children eat wild berries, they howl like wolves... The woods, that's the city? On screen... Hectic road traffic... A forest of buildings. You, sitting in the middle. Only the images move. A dialogue between images and text. You've been bleeding. No... Stay... Did you know that Torajans in Indonesia bury their dead babies in the trees? For them to be reborn into another form, like a vegetal womb... "Hansel and Gretel" in the Torajas... If we transpose it, we could film fetuses trapped in the city's concrete... When they grow, they become skyscrapers... Yes. Keep going... Before I die... Before I die, I want to... Travel to Iceland. Compose a minuet. Do the splits. Meet a dolphin. Invite my neighbor. Have sex with a tree. And if I die tomorrow... Go to the movies. Smoke weed. Write my name in Japanese. Soon I'll be gone. Too quick, too soon. A pebble in your shoe, an itchy clothing tag, I can't swim. A pubic hair on your passport photo. Thrown into the water, onto the street, dropped at night on a highway rest area. Make a wish. I want to die before you just to annoy you. When a child is seriously ill, it's left by its parents in the woods. Lost in the woods, the children try to survive. They eat wild berries, learn how to make a fire, howl like wolves, clean their wounds with healing plants and snuggle up together in their sleep. One day they come across a man in a white shirt, who takes them to a white house with white walls, white beds and white lamps. Behind the white lies the darkness. And the darkness is inside us, pierces through us, wears us out from within. The children though are not afraid. They dare the witch and destroy her. Day after day. Because the children want to play. Until the end. Play. Play. MY LITTLE SISTER
