PETERSON: All right. Russell, did you do the work? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Ms. Peterson. MS. PETERSON: You're killing me. I'm sorry. MS. PETERSON: I don't want to hear it. All right. Um, everybody, we have a new student. Nick, why don't you stand up? Oh, no. It's OK. MS. PETERSON: Oh, no, really. I insist. Why don't you introduce yourself? Uh, well, you already called me Nick, so they kind of already know what they need to know. But in case you're hard of hearing, I'm Nick. [laughter] When someone talks to me like that, what am I supposed to do, let that happen? You've got to fucking think... I'm going to get up in their motherfucking grill, yo. I'm not that kind of person. You can't be getting up in motherfuckers' grills all the time, right? You think stuff through. Motherfuckers can't think that they can get up in my grill... [interposing voices] Yo, [inaudible] (WHISPERING) What? (WHISPERING) Do you smell that? SEAMUS: You getting high? Yo, sick. What up, man? I'm Seamus. This is Russell. RUSSELL: Yeah. What's up, [inaudible] - What's up? Russell, man. Yo, that shit was so funny earlier. I was fucking dying laughing. Yeah. She always does that stand up in front of the class bullshit. It's the worst. You have no idea about how bad I want to hate fuck that angel. I was a dick. No, yeah. We were all fucking dying. It was hilarious. Don't let that shit burn out. Look at this contraption you got, man, with the car freshener. Man, this is intricate, dude. RUSSELL: Did you make this? - Yeah. RUSSELL: It's tight. - Can you hold that? No. Why do you always think I'm just going to hold your shit? Can you please just fucking... I would hold it for you. Fine, I'll hold it. I'll hold it. - Thank you. - Just ask me next time, man. [bell ringing] SEAMUS: Fuck. I've got to get to French. Are you free right now? Uh, I mean, I think so. I have no idea. I don't get my schedule at all, but. Wait, you take French? Why? That's hard as fuck, right? - Yeah, man. It's super fucking hard. I'm failing the fuck out. But I want to learn so bad and just speak it all the time, order crepes in French and shit. I mean, that sounds... yo, what the fuck? I didn't get a hit. I'll give you one, motherfucker. Relax. He's a fucking lunatic. Watch out. It's true. SEAMUS: Let me see your schedule. Oh. [paper rustling] It's like hieroglyphics. Dude, you have English right now. Are you serious? Yeah, but you're good. She's super cool about that kind of thing. She's a huge donor. We see her asleep in class literally all the time. Really? That's really funny. SEAMUS: Yeah. She's fucking brain dead. Hey, what are you doing Friday? Nothing. I'm bored as fuck. Well, yo, I mean, if you're not doing anything, you should come check on this party at the [inaudible] It's going to be... - Yeah. Yo, it's like the nicest hotel in the city. You got to be there. Can you not see that I'm in the middle of a goddamn motherfucking sentence? Can you not wait a second. Yo, my... my fault. My fault. Jesus Christ. So, as I was fucking saying, this chick's parents are really loaded. She lives here year round, throws these huge parties. I mean, it's going to be nuts. It's going to be really fun. You want to come? Yeah, that's... yeah, that sounds really fun. You sure it's cool for me to go? SEAMUS: Bro, 1,000%. Yeah. Yo, is Hymen going to be there? He calls my girlfriend Hymen. Her name's Eliza. There's literally no connection. He just likes saying hymen. It's weird as fuck. No, but seriously, is she going to be there? Yeah. I mean, she's coming. Fuck. Yo, you never pay attention to me when she's there. Yo, I swear to God, it's like his fucking balls just evaporate whenever she's around. Yo, your name's Nick, right? - Yeah. - All right. Nick, well, hit me up on Facebook. I'll give you the deets, all right? My last name's [inaudible] because I'm a fucking leprechaun. So just look that up and you can stalk me or whatever. - All right. - All right. Yo, I'll see you Friday, huh? - All right. Yeah. OK, cool. Peace out, nigga. Nice to meet you guys. You want this? Um, yeah. SEAMUS: You got your car freshener? [laughter] Yo, it's great to meet you. All right, dude. Nice to meet you, man. RUSSELL: See you. Cool. [clapping] [tv show playing] [laughter] [muffled chatter] MAN (ON TV): Am I... am I... am I fucking crazy? Am I stupid? CAL: Oh. I didn't know you was up. It's, like, 8:30. MAN (ON TV): It's like, all right, you know... Yeah, my bad. NICK: No, it's fine. MAN (ON TV):... certain sound and get a certain touch for it just to be kind of fucking shitted on by this fucking [imitating drumming]. It's fucking loud as shit, man. It sounds awful. It's loud as shit. I don't want to have to go in there and now play some fucking Fender Rhodes electric bullshit just to kind of compensate. It's an acoustic piano, right? MAN (ON TV): Yeah. MAN (ON TV): Right. So, just turn all the other shit down so that you can... you can just hear it and you can hear the keys as they are. To me, it's fucking beautiful. Can we turn that... can we turn that camera off? Can we turn the camera off? Otherwise, I will smash it to the ground. Do you... CAL: Hey, Ernest. That's Mike's son, Nick. Nick, that's Ernest. Sick. Ernest, like the author. Oh, cool. You know, in college, they would call me Hemingway, like the author, like the brilliant one. You know what I'm saying? Like, I don't know if I'm a genius or not, but he was, so does that make me one? But, you know, people are going to do what they're going to do. Names are names are names, right? Right. You know, people say I'm ahead of my time. I feel like I am my time, if you know what I mean. I mean, yeah. Yeah, um, he's doing a documentary, and I put together some footage from the studio to show him. Oh, cool. ERNEST: Your dad was a fucking legend, man. Amazing. Yeah. Yeah, he's the best. Yeah. Ernest, um, I'm going to go ahead and wrap it up, man. What? Yeah, I'm getting tired. I mean, you said you had so much to show me. It's still pretty early. Ernest, the night's not young anymore. OK. Wait, but don't... I mean, don't let me fuck up your guys' hang. CAL: No. No, no, no. You're not fucking nothing up. It's... I can go back upstairs. CAL: No, we're getting tired. I'll call you. All right. Nice meeting you, Nick. Yeah, you, too, Hemingway. CAL: OK, Ernest. You know, you don't have to hide my dad from me. It's not some big thing. No, I... I wasn't hiding your dad from you. I'm tired. OK. I'm, um... I'm going to go up to my room. Nick, trust me, you don't want to see him like... Yeah, it's over. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's all good. I'm just... I just want to go up to my room, OK? CAL: All right. All right. Goodnight. [phone ringing] Hello? SHAMUS (ON PHONE): Yo. What's up, man? It's Seamus. NICK: Oh, hey. What's up, man? SHAMUS (ON PHONE): Um, it's Friday. NICK: Oh, shit. Is that, um... is that hotel thing... the party thing, did I miss it? SHAMUS (ON PHONE): No. No, you're good. It was cancelled. It's on for next Friday. Her folks came into town early, I guess. NICK: Oh, cool. OK. SHAMUS (ON PHONE): Yeah. Um, so instead, me, Russell, Skyler, and my girlfriend... NICK: Hymen? SHAMUS (ON PHONE): [laughter] Yeah. [laughter] Hymen. Actually, dude, you know what? When you're here, you should call her Eliza. NICK: No. Yeah, of course. SHAMUS (ON PHONE): Um, yeah. So, we're thinking we're all going to go out to this club and try to get in. And if not, we'll just go to Russell's place or walk around or something, but we'll figure it out. You want to come? [cars driving by] SEAMUS: Yo, what's up? What's up? What up, man? I'm fucking cold. Yeah. Yo, my balls just went up inside my body. It's crazy. I remember you. Hi. SEAMUS: You guys met? Yeah. It was a pretty awkward elevator ride, huh? Yeah. Sorry. I was... I was pretty nervous and pretty high. ELIZA: No, it's OK. First day of school's always really shitty. SKYLER: Yo, can we go? I got people waiting. All right. Where we at? I told you, like, seven fucking times. Yo, I have a shitty memory. Jesus. - Day and Night. It's a club. - OK. That's all you had to say. You don't have to be a dick about it. Yeah, no. It's not that you're retarded and have amnesia and can't remember a fucking thing, it's that I'm an asshole. RUSSELL: Yo, I do not have amnesia. All right. I'm gone. Bye. - Yo, Skyler. I'll knock you the fuck out right now. - Yeah, man? - Yeah. SEAMUS: All right. All right. If you don't walk away in 12 seconds, I'm going to knock your fucking teeth out. That's a very specific amount of time. Sky, just go. For real, Russell's going to lose his shit. Come on. Yeah. Walk away, you bitch ass pussy. Later, Sky. Peace. Yo, I hope you get hit by a truck on the way there, you bitch ass, fuck ass... Good one, buddy. ...Fuck boy. Fuck you. That was pretty bad, wasn't it? Yeah. Fuck me. You've got to think about your shit before you start saying... Don't fucking worry about me. Maybe I'm not... SEAMUS: I just don't want you to get left... Wow. So, they really hate each other, huh? [scoffs] Nah, they always do that and then make up. It's really weird. Honestly, I think they just secretly want to fuck each other. [MUSIC - TAME IMPALA, "THE LESS I KNOW THE BETTER"] TAME IMPALA (SINGING): Someone said they left together. I ran out the door to get her. She was holding hands with Trevor. Not the greatest feeling ever. Man, Russell's got a lot of nudes in his house. It's very fitting. The smell of this house kind of reminds me of field trips I took to museums in, like, fourth grade, which is kind of depressing because that means that I haven't been to a museum in, like, seven years. [laughter] Isn't it weird how a smell can transport you into a different universe, time, or whatever? Yeah. Smell is the sense most strongly related to memory, I think. Oh. But I may have just made that up right now. ELIZA: [laughter] No, but I think I have heard that. NICK: Really? Yeah. I used to go to this country house when I was younger with my parents and cousins and stuff. We would go, like, every other weekend for years. And there was this smell in the house. And I could... I could smell it right now when I think about it. It was, like, this leathery sort of... it was, like, a weird tangy smell, which wasn't even the best smell, but I... I just always remembered it as my country house. So, anyway, I walked in the house one day, and it smelled completely different. And I was, like, 14. And I went up to my mom, and I was like, what the fuck happened to the smell of the house? She was like, I got rid of the couch in the den because it was old and torn up and I needed to throw it out. I know, right? Fucking... And I was so mad at her because my whole childhood was with that smell. Right. And I... I'm rambling. - No, you're not. - Yes. No, no. I know what you're saying. I really know what you're saying. I do that when I get so... No, I... I know 100% what you're saying. I agree. It's awesome. [laughter] [music - asap rocky, "goldie"] A$AP ROCKY (SINGING): [inaudible] [piano music] [inaudible] [piano music] You're good. No, I'm not. My dad taught me a bunch of piano when I was little, so I know I still suck. [piano music] (LAUGHING) Oh, my god. [piano music] You're like Mozart. NICK: Yeah, exactly. I'm just as good as Mozart. OK, well, maybe not quite as good as Mozart. NICK: What? [bang] Ow. Fuck. Shit. Are you OK? NICK: Ow. Fuck. Ow. Oh, my god. Oh, you poor baby. Piano is very dangerous. Hey, I could be blind right now. You're not blind, you drama queen. [music - asap rocky, "goldie"] A$AP ROCKY (SINGING): Party like a cowboy or a rockstar. Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off. Yes, I'm the shit. Tell me, do I stink? It feel good waking up to money in the bank. Three model bitches. Cocaine in the sink. And I'm so 'bout it, 'bout it, I might roll up in a tank 'cause my chain came from Cuba. Got a lock up on the link. [piano music] I think I'm going to sneeze. Sneeze. Do it. Go. Look up at the light. Look up at the... there you go. There. Come on. Feel it. (SINGING) Let me sneeze, please. I have to sneeze, please. (SINGING) Let him sneeze. Where'd you get that? Where'd you get that from? - Shit. The fuck is this? This is my grandma's fucking gardening tool, you idiot. I'm sorry. Sorry. Yo, hey. Hey, Shamo. How are you? You OK? You all right? You going to be OK? You need some help? I fucked up, bro. Oh, it's OK. It's OK, buddy. Oh, fuck. Everything OK? Um, yeah. I just got to go, like, right now. Um, where's Russell and Seamus? Don't know. OK. I didn't realize how late it was. I have to get the hell out of here. No. NICK: I know. I know. I wish I could stay. Kyle. Kyle, get over here. RUSSELL: [moaning] I need your help. I need your help with him. Um, listen, get everybody the fuck off my roof right now. - How am I supposed to do that? - I don't know. I don't know. But I can't have them here. I can't do it. Just say something. - Yeah. - Get them out. - All right. - Get them out. All right. [music - asap rocky, "goldie"] Yo, everybody get the fuck off the roof. Cops are here. [crowd yelling] That was easy. [people yelling faintly] Yo, what's going on? The fucking cops are here, bro. Shit. All right. I'm going to go find Seamus and Russell. What? Just wait one second. KYLE: You good? SEAMUS: [coughing] - Come on. You've got to stand up. Yo, Nick. Oh, where you been, man? I've been downstairs. Are the cops here? No. No, We just said that so those fuckers would leave. You... [coughing] You scared the fucking shit out of me, dude. - I'm sorry, man. No, that was me. I kicked them off. I was like, get the fuck off... - We know, Kyle. Shut the fuck up. KYLE: How would he know if he wasn't here? RUSSELL: Because he doesn't give a shit. I ran so much. RUSSELL: He doesn't care, OK? You're literally obsessed with attention. SEAMUS: [moaning] What's wrong with him? Nigga's smacked, yo. SEAMUS: [moaning] Hey, man. SEAMUS: [moaning] How you doing, man? Nick, I fucked up, man. NICK: What do you mean? SEAMUS: I fucked up. I'm a fucking idiot shit brain motherfucker. I think you might just be really drunk. No, I'm not. I'm a fucking willow. Willow Smith. Is that an animal? No. I think that's Will Smith's daughter. All right. [inaudible] We've got to get him to bed. Can you fucking help me? - Give me a fucking second. - Please. [inaudible] fucking cigarette [inaudible] Get his leg. KYLE: [inaudible] no sense of urgency. - I feel like I should help. - No, no, no. You're good, bro. OK. Yo, Nick, thanks for the help, man. Yo, you told me not to help. Shut the fuck up, bro. Shut up. Russell, I'm done with you tonight. Hey, are there cops? No. There are no cops. Eliza. ELIZA: What happened? Eliza. He's a little bit drunk. Eliza. ELIZA: A little bit? Eliza, baby. Come here, baby. I love you so much. Come on. RUSSELL: We don't have time for this. SEAMUS: Come on, baby. Come here. Oh, my god. - Love you, too. SEAMUS: Jesus Christ. Come here, baby. Wow. Hi. Hi. Hey. Hi. Come here. Ow. You just hit me in the fucking face. ELIZA: I should get you this drunk every night. SEAMUS: No. No, no, no, no, no. I'm a fucking idiot. RUSSELL: Yo, we gotta get him... we gotta get him to bed, OK? We gotta get him to bed. We gotta get him to bed. Hey, will you text his parents he's sleeping here? I don't... I don't... what? I don't know their number. Just text them from his phone, please. - Yeah. - Do you guys need help? No, no, no. Nick, we'll see you Monday, OK? Seamus, come on. Seamus, come on. - Nicholas. - Buddy. Nicholas. I'll see you Monday. I love you, dog. NICK: See you. SEAMUS: Eliza, I love you, baby. NICK: Feel better, buddy. [chatter] [chuckling] Well, um, I'll see you Monday. See you Monday. That was fun. It was. Cool. CAL: [whistling] Nick. It's 3 o'clock in the morning. I know. I'm sorry. I just... my friend was really just... No, stop defending yourself... I'm not... - ...and just say you're sorry. - All right. I'm sorry. But I was just out... OK, but an apology ain't defending yourself. I'm... I'm not defending myself. I'm just saying I'm sorry. Well, I was just worried about you. I've been up worried about you all night. Well, you don't have to be worried about me. Yes, I do, because you live with me. I take care of you. And, I mean, this is not one of the five things on my list that I like doing. All right. Well, I'm sorry that my mom's so fucked up that I had to come... CAL: Hey, don't go there. NICK:... disturb your precious little life. Don't go where? CAL: Don't go there with the drug addict card. I'm not pulling... Don't play the drug addict card, OK? Because that's not what this is about. Then what is this about? This is about you coming in at a time that I told you to. Stop trying to bring all these issues when all I was saying was be in the house at a certain time. That's it. That's what I'm mad about. All right. OK? That's what I'm upset about. - All right. I'm sorry. - Yeah. Well, don't be sorry. Be careful. [door shutting] [phone dinging] [phone dinging] NICK: Goddammit. [phone keyboard clicking] [knocking on door] Oh, motherfucker. Come in.

[indistinct talking on phone] Good. [indistinct talking on phone] No, no, I am. It's just a little strange to hear your voice. That's all. [indistinct talking on phone] We just haven't spoken in a little while. [indistinct talking on phone] No, it's just annoying. It's just you're my mom. You're not like a distant second cousin or something. Like, just why would I forget you? It's just annoying for you to say. [indistinct talking on phone] It's fine. I'm sorry, too. [indistinct talking on phone] Yeah. Well, you know it's like a four to six week thing, right? So, you know, you say it's been a hard week, but it's what you've done four more times essentially. So, you know, it just makes me a little worried when you say that. When... nothing. I just... I just... I just want to make sure you actually do this. Mommy, please don't cry. [indistinct talking on phone] Mom, I love you, OK? I just... I just really... I gotta go. OK. Mom, It's OK. It's OK. I love you, Mom. Bye.

[snoring] I feel like I hear, like, snoring. Snoring? Really? [snoring] (WHISPERING) Yeah. I don't know where it's coming from, but I'm hearing... I'm definitely hearing snoring. I don't know. I think you're just crazy. [snoring] SEAMUS: Hey, babe. ELIZA: [shushing] (WHISPERING) Sorry. Um, Sky's downstairs. We're going to head out. You coming?

We'll see you guys, uh, tomorrow. Uh, Monday or whatever. Hey, ice those bruises. [chuckling] [door shutting] [snoring] ELIZA: [laughter] See, it's perfect. [laughter] It's perfect. You going to sit? [sigh] Yeah. It was pretty hectic back there, huh? Yeah. I'm sorry about that. They were just fucking with Lola, and they were wearing these stupid clothes. I was on some drugs. And, um, sometimes, I just... I see red, and I can't... I don't know. Like, yeah. I don't know. I'm sorry. No, it's OK. I appreciate you looking out for her. Well, [inaudible] instigated it, and I lost my shit like a psychopath. But... but they were dicks, so. Did you guys make out? NICK: Me and the frat boys? Yeah. It was very passionate. No, you and Lola. No, not really. What's this? Oh, it's Cal's. It's this piano player, George Shearing. Is he good? Yeah, he's amazing. But he's so old. [chuckling] But look how sweet he is. He's so... he's, like, the sweetest old man. He's so happy. [interposing voices] I heard... the rumor has it that they took this picture and then he... and then he died. The next picture was him dead. Do you want to listen? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Mhm. - You sure? - Yeah. - OK. Yeah. NICK: It's getting real. [piano music playing] [chuckling] I like your tattoo. You do? Mhm. (WHISPERING) You're the worst [inaudible] Fuck. We can stop. We can stop. I know. Your body's so amazing. This fucking shirt. Fucking shirt. Do it. Do you have a condom? Um, yeah. I think so. Do you have a preference? No. Which one did you pick? [inaudible] [inaudible] You sure? Yeah. [panting] [laughter] Was that a mistake? Did it feel like a mistake? No. I like you. Really? A lot. What about Seamus? I like Seamus, too, but I don't know. He seems distant. But then he'll, like, randomly start kissing me in public. But I don't know. It's confusing. I like you so much. I have since I met you. Same. I wish this wasn't such a fucked up situation. "Minnaloushe creeps through the grass alone, important, and wise and lifts to the changing moon his changing eyes." What's that? My dad used to read it to me. It's the last few lines in this poem, "The Cat and the Moon." It's this tattoo on my back. He would, like, tuck me in. And then he'd start to walk out, but he never actually left. He just waited in the doorway until I said, daddy, daddy, daddy, come back. And then he'd come back, and he'd sit on the edge of the bed. And he'd recite the whole thing for me in, like, a different accent every night or, like, a different way of doing it or something. And then I'd always get really tired when I heard those last two lines and fall asleep. I honestly think the reason for my insomnia in the past few years is that I'm always waiting to hear those last few lines. But, you know, they obviously never come. It's weird, though. It's like my sleep's never 100% because I'm always waiting to hear his voice, as stupid as that sounds. Why is that stupid? I don't know. When did he pass away? Um, I was about 12, so I guess it was, like, five years ago. Yeah. It was this really weird thing where, um... I told you he was in a band with Cal. And they had a lot of problems, I think, so they broke up a little while ago. But then they wanted to do this reunion show thing, so my dad came to New York to stay here with Cal and, like, rehearse and get ready for the show and all of that. And, um, I don't really know what happened, but, um, there was a fight and my dad went out and got really fucked up. And he was in the subway. And I guess he blacked out. And he slipped on something on the edge of the platform and, um... yeah. And the worst part is these fucking cops all said to my mom that maybe, like, he jumped in front of it or something because from, like, where his remains were from the positioning of his body when the train hit him, it didn't seem like an accident or something. And of course my mom believed it because she's insanely gullible. But I know in my heart that that is total bullshit. Like, he... he just wasn't like that, you know. I mean, some people are, but he just... he wasn't selfish like that. He... I just can't imagine... yeah, he didn't. What? Nothing. Well, the whole thing is just so stupid and fucked up. I just... I just wish that I could, like, smell, like, a... smell, like, a sweater again or, you know, smell his hair again or something, you know, because I just... I don't... I don't remember what it... what it smells like. I don't remember what his hair smells like. Sorry. I don't... I'm sorry. This is embarrassing. [inaudible] I feel like I'm just being so annoying right now. ELIZA: No, you're not. Yeah, I am. I'm being so annoying. Please don't be sorry. You're OK. I'm so stupid. ELIZA: No. I'm so stupid. You're not stupid. - Yeah, it is. It's stupid. ELIZA: No, it's not stupid. [crying] ELIZA: You're OK. [piano music] [imitating trumpet] CAL: Oh, man. That's a great mouth trumpet you got there. Yeah, I'm pretty goddamn good at mouth trumpet. Yeah. And I dig those changes. They're kind of nice, right? Like, I can see my dad playing this and then you playing, like, that line on sax or something. CAL: Yeah. And singing, (SINGING) dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. You start singing something like that. - Yeah. - Something like that. Yeah. [piano music] Man, you and your dad, y'all got those ears. Yeah. [piano music] Hey, um, I got some news. I got a call from your mom today. She said that she was doing good and it was cool for you to come back next week. That's, like... that's a few weeks early, right? CAL: Yeah. Well, she said she was doing good and, um, she's excited to see you. OK. All right. But, like, I mean, the clinic approved it or whatever? Yeah, the clinic approved her, she said. And, uh, I talked to her on the phone. She sounded pretty good. I think it's a good thing, right? Yeah. CAL: Hey, keep playing that. Keep playing. I want to show you something. Oh, shit. Whoa, whoa. OK, now. Keep doing what you're doing, and I'mma count you off, OK? Let's go. 1, 2, 3, and. [piano and flute music] Yeah. That was pretty cool. That was good. That was good. OK, now, play on the bass. A, E flat, G, C sharp. [piano music] So play that on the bass? CAL: Yeah, on the bass. [piano music] OK, let's try it. OK. 1, 2, 3, 4. [piano and flute music] [dinging] [knocking on door] Hey. Hey. You can't sleep? CAL: Never. [chuckling] Hey, I want to ask you an honest question. Does it have anything to do with not feeling so fresh down there? CAL: No. What is it? Um, how do you feel about everything? I mean, do you think it's OK for you to go back? What do you mean, with my mom? Yeah. Just... NICK: You mean is it safe? No, no. Not... not... not is it safe. Well, what else am I supposed to do? CAL: Uh... I gotta go back. I don't know. Do you? Well, I mean, I'm all she has. I mean, yeah, it's a bummer, but if she's feeling better and they're letting her out, then, yeah, I gotta go back. CAL: I don't know if they let her out or if she chose to leave. I don't know. I mean, she's still my guardian, you know. She's still my mom. CAL: Well, I was just thinking about it. I mean, you know, of course in a perfect world, I'd love to stay here with you in this big house, you know, jamming all the time and hanging in New York, but my mom's given up everything for me, so. CAL: Yeah, but you don't owe her anything. Well, I don't really think you know what you're talking about. OK. I think you should invest in some sleeping pills. You, too. Goodnight. CAL: Goodnight. [door shutting] Surprise, motherfucker. Jesus Christ. Oh, my god, dude. You scared the fucking shit out of me. Oh, my god. - I'm sorry. What's up, man? How you doing? - Good. - Good? - Yeah. I heard you're leaving town this weekend. The fuck's up with that? Yeah, I know. It's like, um, just, like, a last minute thing. Huh. I haven't really seen you around or anything, you know. It kind of feels like you've been avoiding me. No. No. I just... I've just been really swamped with work all week. Yeah. Yeah, OK. Well, hey, do you want to go out tonight? I think me and Eliza are going to get dinner. I'm pretty sure Lola's got nothing going on. We could do, like, a going away thing. Well, yeah. I mean, thanks for inviting me, but I don't really know if I like Lola like that. And, um, I don't know. It's like a date with you and Eliza. I don't want to, like, intrude or anything. No. Dude, no, no, no, no. Yo, it's not going to be like that at all. I promise. Hey. Seamus. Seamus, just... What? Take it easy. Oh, you... you said turn it up a notch? OK. Seam, just... [inaudible] in front of my friends... Sorry. ...At the dinner table. ELIZA: Seamus, can you... SEAMUS: I'm going to just bite your ear off, OK? I'm just going to take it off. Seamus, you've got to stop. You don't need this ear, right? - Seamus. - Your other ear is nice enough. Come on. OK. OK. You're done. You're done. Do we need to drink more? We should drink more. This pasta is dry. It's dry. [laughter] It's super fucking dry. I've been eating it for, like, 10 minutes. It's for sure, like, difficult to eat. ELIZA: Seamus. SEAMUS: [inaudible] I don't know this homie's name, but I feel like it's Jeff, the waiter [inaudible] out. Don't. Jeff. It's so not Jeff. It's so not Jeff. I've got to hide. [inaudible] Wait, babe. Seamus, you're being weird. Tell me... tell me when Jeff [inaudible] Fuck. We've got to get a new waiter. - Seamus. OK, you're done. SEAMUS: OK. ELIZA: You're done.

It's getting pretty hot and heavy over there, huh? Um, do you have anything else, um, in your bag? What? Like, you have any pills or anything? Uh, yeah, yeah. I... I think...

A desperate housewife. Cooking and cleaning. [laughter] How is it? It's really good. I really like you. I really wish you were my girlfriend. Jumping right in. Sorry. Don't be sorry. Look, Nick, you're leaving in, like, three days, and I don't know if I'll see you again. And I'm dating Seamus. I know he can be an idiot, and I know that he cheats on me, but... But what?

I don't know anybody here. Yeah, they're not here yet. I think your face actually looks better this way. I was thinking the same thing. I'm sure you heard Eliza broke up with me. No, I didn't. I'm sorry, man. No, you're not. I kind of fucked that up. I honestly just hope she ends up happy. Yeah, me too. It's mad awkward tonight, though. You know, I didn't tell anyone. You didn't? No. Yo, I actually got you something. You're always talking about how you want to learn French, so I thought it might be easier with dirty words and shit. Hey, I don't know if I ever told you this, but, um, I've never, like, technically had friends before, like, back in Detroit. Yo. What? You know what asshole is in French? No. What is it? Enculer, yo. Really? Yeah. You're a fucking enculer. Yeah, I am. But you're my enculer. [chuckling] There's no way it's pronounced enculer. No, it is. Because the... oh, no, it's for sure not. It just doesn't sound French. No, because the accent's on the fucking E. So it's encul... enculer. En... I don't fucking know, bro. I told you... (LAUGHING) I told you, man. Can you read? I have fucking dyslexia. I told you. [MUSIC - JENS NEKMAN, "A POSTCARD TO NINA"] JENS NEKMAN (SINGING): His Catholic heart is big and slow. You know I'll do anything for love, but, Nina, what were you thinking of? Homedog. [inaudible] Where were you guys? Just having a smoke outside. Why... why didn't you invite me? Why... why do I not get an invite? It's not always about you. I do... 98% of the shit I do in my life is with you. [chatter] JENS NEKMAN (SINGING): But, Nina, I can be your boyfriend, so you can stay with your girlfriend. Your father's mailing me all the time. He says he just wants to say hi. I send back out of office auto replies. Nina, I just want to check in 'cause I think about you every second. So I send you this postcard just to say, don't let anyone stand in your way. Yours truly, Jens Lekman. Don't let anyone stand in your way. Don't let anyone stand in your way. Don't let anyone stand in your way. Don't let anyone stand in your way. Don't let anyone stand in your way. [music playing]
