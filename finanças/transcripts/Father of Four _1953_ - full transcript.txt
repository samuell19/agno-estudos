Where? Oh, Per tho. Your bad boy. - Where could it drop you into Per? - I was away. - Uh, where are you wet. - It is for you also. This is what I say. You should never, ever go from his good, hot, warm, and dry home. So, now the sun is shining. We must hurry and go. Now we must go in the forest. Then, you can believe no. - Well I'm hungry. - It is the father also. Hello up there! There is served! - Hurry up and put music on. - Yes. Welcome to the green! There is guaranteed no ants. Safe for to sit at the beetroot. It should do well with a bit of bread after drench. Where is the opener? - Here! - Thank you. And what do you say? - Red soft drink. - Go ahead. Thank you. - Is the food done? - We are late. If Mankeborg notice it, there is one on the box. The One on the box. Here you go. Have you remembered your style? Yes, yes. The elephant never forgets. - Goodbye, father. - Goodbye, children. - Go ahead, father. - Thank you, my sweet girl. Is there something you are upset about? How do I get it to run around with all the expenses? You have so often promised me to ask for a raise. Do it now! I stiffens, when I am faced with director Andersen - and to speak about private things. Since you have earned it with all that overtime. - He is a quite ordinary man. - Director Andersen? Common? No, he is an iceberg. Spirit on him, the father. Then he'll melt him. - Goodbye, daddy's boy. - Goodbye, father. What are you looking at? You! - What's your name? - I am named Per. Beware you just. I'm Tarzan. Oh. Can you move yourself? Or I have to shoot your elephant. No, you may not. (tarzan scream) Oh, little elephant. See, it bleeds! You can see, I could hit, huh? It just didn't die, no! Go with you. - The director will speak with Them. - Oh. Yes, come in. Listen here, take the papers - - and transfer the amount we talked about, to the savings bank. Yes, yes. And for what it was, I would say... Mortensen travel from the us to the first. - Well, it is certainly? - Yes, unfortunately. We must reduce. The times are not the same, as they have been. Then, they are worse, dry one enough to say. It will mean a slight advantage for Them. Well! I think it is fair, They put Them on A seat by the window. - There is brighter. - Yes. (the phone rings) Yes? Is it the province? Well it is good. Give me them. - What it was, They would say? - Sorry, it was on the Hello? Hello? It is not something that can wait? They see just how busy I am. Yes, yes. Hello, director Svendsen. I have seen on it. They get the 52.000. Aw, what. It is pennies. Yes, what is the 52,000 today? Uhm! I love clear buttermilk cold bowl Here you go. I like to go to the cinema, can I, dad? - I don't believe it. We must save a little. - He have not read homework. It was otherwise a really good movie with Tarzan. Tarzan live over there. Nonsense, man! I'm talking about Tarzan. He lives over there. Well, living there is mrs Sejersen. To the other side. There has moved a boy into. He is beastly. I met him just before. He pulled me in hair. Hard! Him shall I give enough fix. He should get a few smacks. He's called Tarzan. He shot my elephant. Yes, it is true, Little Per. (tarzan hollar) - It sounds creepy. - It is him. Come. You'll beat him, when we have eaten, no? Yes, yes. Well, is it him? He's probably not meant anything by it. It was probably just for fun. Ha, you dare not. See, I have the farmer with the whip. What is it of? It is my plate. Hit with it! It is my plate! So, so. Remember, the one who spills on the cloth, must wash up all alone. Now go check, I'll handle the rest. Then, it would be uneducational. What do you think the kids would say? Nothing. They are in the bathroom. They must be in bed early. Moreover, no polishing of glass, as I have. It is a science that polishing the glass. See now this here lovely old antique glass I am always nervous. I think probably, I for the future, should myself... Yes, I think you should. I know it's good. I'm an old fool. Not old, and not a fool. - Well, it seems you, however, not yet? - No. - You just looks it. - Yes. I think the kids are so quiet. "His clear-cut profile under the silver helm- - accounted against the evening sky, which fire round like fire." - Ih, where it is good. - Be now quiet. - Hello, you are well on way to wash yourself? - Yes! I think not, I can hear it. Turn up of the water. "The vast expanse of the landscape bar a own strange enjoy ..." - Scary! - Well, scary. "Suddenly burst a terrible storm on the loose. The rain crashed down." Uh! Well so close, however, for the water! Beware! She comes! Well, then you are finished? Keep me well, what with all the water? We just thought we needed to be really clean. You are all wet in your hair, child. I washed it. It is so nice to have clean hair. The Black Rider on the floor, and Premium washes hair without loosening the braids. I look really so stupid? (the doorbell rings) If it is mrs. Sejersen, I'll scream. Good evening. I thought They were out cycling in the lovely weather. I'm not going anywhere. And here I thought the young people now-a-days, was never at home. Good evening, mrs Sejersen. It was nice of Them to look into. They may well be a small moment. Thank you so much, if I'm not going to the trouble. - What do you say to a cup of coffee? - The coffee is wonderful. - Can we get Sis to make. - You can't sleep on the coffee, father. - So can we have tea. - Tea is lovely. Well, we have no more tea. So I have a much better idea. What about the two of us we ran a small trip - - and sniffed the spring? We are going to run? Perhaps it is foolish to sit inside in good weather. - Sis, you will sit with the children? - Go surely, if you like. But then They have to help me the clothes on. Thank you very much. There we have the little boyish. - What is it now, Per? - I could not sleep, actually. I think the little boyish must have a big money to cozy dazly with. Why are you talking like that? - Go ahead. - Thank you. It may not get much for. So, so, Per. Well, there have we the big ones. However, however, however, however, however, however... - Good night, dad. - Good night. See so to get up in the bed with you. - How old are you now, Ole? - Me? 12. I am 12 years old. No, father, you grow down?! Up in bed with you! What is the name of your fine elephant? - He called Bodil Kjer. - It was a strange name. - Several are called that. - Should we go? - Yes. Goodbye. - Good luck, father. Sis, her bothered I not that much about. Have you seen my sea shell? Now it's gone again. - No, I have not seen it. - So is it the little slave! - You have taken my conch. - No, I pray at night. It is probably you anyway. It was you. Shame on you! Here is it! Move you a little. Why, she comes running here every moment? I have thought of it. You know what I think? - Have you not guessed it? - Nah. Oh, where are men stupid. She is in love with the father. In father?! Stop up with that! So rather step on the flat of the ladybugs. (high scream) There is something living in my bed. No, is there? It sucked on my big toe. Nonsense. A wet sponge. Yes, it is thank you for last since you came kløpulver in my bed. Goodnight. (squeal) Come on if you dare! Hold up! Now, you should get some beatings! It's snowing! It's snowing! I have so often wondered, why they didn't get merried again. Why would I do that? Life is, however, more beautiful when you are two. And, you are such a stately man. Now flatters me. Besides, I have Sis. She is so young. And the children need, sorry, I said it, - - but they need a firm and motherly hand. I think it goes very well. Yet. But one day, your daughter gets married, then what? - Marry? - She is 18 years old. Maybe she is already in love? I assure you, Sis does not go in that kind of thoughts. Not yet, anyway. - Well, They would maybe rather have that? - Yes, thank you. - Go ahead. - Thank you. I am so restless, awake and hear my heart beat alas, only in the merciful deep Deep... deep... I am so restless, awake... alas, only in the merciful deep... ... can I my beloved reach. Yes. (whistle out of the way) Good Evening, Sis. You want to drive on a moonlit drive? No thanks, I don't have time. Good Night, Peter. Well, Sis... Oh. - Ole... - Yes. - Is Knippelsbridge out in one? - Of course. - Are you sure? - Yes. Otherwise you can't get over on the other side. Just wanted you to know, what we have thoughht of with the new teacher. With hr. Stahr? Yes, in the song hour. Just for that he should feel at home with the same. - What is it? - I do not say that. Is it something with drawing pens on the chair? Do you think I'm hethen? Then, you, it is a war of nerves. The harrowing details of simplicity. Peter, you have the eraser? Hurry up, god, he comes. Ole, hurry up a little. Connect me the water. Oh, where is it sin for him! You can't do that. - Good morning, all together. - Good morning. Well, you're my new class. You look really nice. We should probably have it cosy together. No? Yeah. I also need to have you in Danish and in mathematic,- - so I shout your name up in the danish hour. You may sit down now. We must have great speed. There is not a long time for the exam. - Oh. - No! - Was there anything you wanted to say? - Me? Not at all. Can you stand up? - What's your name? - Ole. It is you who has been sitting here last? (the class laughs) From time to time. You can hurry you to come up with another chair? Fast! We begin with "In all the riches kingdoms and countries". - You know that? - Yes. Thank you. Ready? In all the rich kingdoms and countries whither I in the world went Stop! - Tell me, sounds like the piano always that way? - Yes! That is awfully hot in here. I think straight, I open a window. Oh yes. It helped. - Well, hr. Stahr, how's it going? - Mr vice-chancellor, thank you. Unfortunately the piano so badly. There has never been complained of it before. It sounds terrible principal. We have always found it useful here at the school. ,- I say it's not for - Let me hear. - With pleasure. - Thank you. - It sounds as nicely. - Yes, it does. But it did not before. Did it well, children? Yes! Yes, yes, mr. Stahr. It is human to error. Go ahead, continue. I think it is better, we sing a different one. Can I put you down and beating up on the number 27? And what is the name of that Ole? "See, let my eye you look". Yes, exactly. Come on. Look, let my eye you see Look, the plane! Oh be quiet, man! It is quite a common DC4 Skymaster. It is a fly, yes, it is. - Scramble off, boy. - No, I will not. - Piss off, I say! - No. Gone with you. So I go and never come back. - See, he does not come back. - Oh, huh. The earth is indeed round. Sooner or later he will probably show up again. Uh! You just look out that, Ole is not coming and smack you! He dare not. Good morning, mr. Harvest. A birkesbread in a terrible hurry. With the crispy crust? It loves Their father so much. And a heartbread. Yes, thank you, one of them. My uncle so well likes. He comes for lunch. And then I have something to Ah no, see now Per! It was right on a hanging hair. Per, tho. You must never go out on the roadway. You know that. - I know, Sis. - So remember it. - You want to have a cocobun, Per? - He deserves it not at all. Come, we must hurry home. Hey! the heart bread? Thank you. And thank you, because they saved The Small Per. It is so little. I always like to do everything for Them. (honking the horn) (honking again) Well be careful, however, boy! (honking) Oh no! No! Beware, however It, however, It was an atrocious vehicle. It is a Dodge. 120 horsepower. Think, is it really? Is your father at home, little Ole? Yes, he is lying in the bathtub. And the door is open. Think. (honking) - Hey, uncle Anders. - Hello, little Ole. Do you know what uncle Anders has to you? A brand new ten cents. Thank you. If this is you, I would rather have a dirty 25-cents. (honking) Oh, silly boy! - Howdy, Little Per. - Howdy. What do you think, Uncle Anders has for you? - A bag with the candy in! - Right, Small Per! Thank you. It is big. They had it no smaller. Hello, uncle Anders. And welcome. Hello, little housewife. I think you look so uncomfortable out. What is the point of it, whether we laugh or cry? - Life do with us what it will. - But, however! After all, we are no more than driftwood, floating with the tide. Well, yes, yes. It may damn well be. Driftwood, yes... (loud bang) It sat right in the eye. Anders, come up here. Sorry, I'm not dressed. I love to go in a bathrobe on a Sunday. I actually also like that for everyday. - Is there something wrong with Sis? - Is there something wrong with her? She looked so strange. So you mrs Sejersen? - You are not really clever. - So, small strokes. We may well ask the kids. Listen, children, you know, if Sis is upset about something? Yes, she is as mighty distraught. - Of what? - It is a secret. Everyone know she is unhappy in love. It you may not be familiar! You promised yourself not to say anything. Ah yes, what good is it, you laugh or cry. However, we are just driftwood, floating with the tide. Well, it is just the student. She has been playing with him since she was little. The child, him, she finished with a long time ago. Now I say it is. It is Paul. Poul? What Poul? I don't know any Paul. Came, so you shall see! There he hangs! It must be a mighty big love. - Oh, my goodness! - There are 29. - Who is that? - Poul Reichardt. The Film Actor. Don't know him. - The ladies' friend. - However, it was terrible. How long has it been going on? Where does she know him from? - She knows him not. - It is why she is unhappy. Oh, I thought so. - Food is on the table! - Remember to wash your hands! Anders, you go just down in advance. I just have a little clothes on. Well, Small Per. You are probably already went to the table. Yes, see, I have the farmer with the whip. That Ole must not see, then he takes it from me. Yes, that's right, Little Per. We keep him here, like this. - We must be cunning. - Yes. - Uncle Anders! - Here we are, Sis. Who has taken my plate? It has you! - No, no. - Oh, how can you wait you. - Mr Balloon avenges itself. - So, so, Mr Balloon. Set you down. - Have you made anything refined? - Fried eggs. The food is now even necessary for the human body. Little is needed. Small Mie, how's it going in school? Yes, thank you, now since the weather is so fine, we sing the morning song in the schoolyard. So can the angels hear it way up in the sky. - Angels? - Yes. Yes, it is indeed logical. How goes it with you, Ole? Ole has been given the note with the home three times. He can't keep up with in the Math, perhaps he may not pass the test. You can't count, boy? It is the new teacher. He can't let me be. - He has been mad on Ole. - It is a stupid snail. - Oh? - He asks about silly things. Can you give me an example? Therefore, if a wife has 1261 apples and 13 children, how many each one gets? Such nonsense! There is no one who has 1261 apples. - 13 children.... - Yes, 1.261 apples and 13 children. Rain it out in your head, go ahead! Nine times, now let me see you Said apples? - 97. - Right! UG. Where is the matter with the apples. In the school of life is the values that count. He is out, I should not be up in the next class. I would so like to be followed with Finn. Him I have mixed blood with. The teacher I liked to talk a few words with. Here is your tea, my boy. The sand cake is warm yet. Thank you, mother. - Uhm. - Should you not correct the math assignments? Remind me not of it. I must play a little first. - How is it going with your tune? - Not good. I'm missing the middle. Now you shall hear. It is there it is. Was it not easier, if you had a text? Olufsen has promised me one. He did not come with it. It was otherwise at the time. It is not on Tuesday, it is childrenhelp's day? 3. g. have stitched some very nifty costumes. The girls, that is. The boys will not be on the bandwagon. They are so superior in that age. (the doorbell rings) - Are you waiting for someone? No, but now I must. (dog howls) Be quiet. Yes, that's it. Here you go. There is something I would very much like to talk with Them about. Here you go, come inside. - Yes, Ole is my brother. - Well, well. - Go ahead, They will not sit down? - No, thank you. (the dog barks) It's Dingo, he's a nice dog. Now They must see its a big number. Dingo, come on down. Set! One, two... - ...two and a half... - Sorry, I only have a moment. I will just say I have come to say to Them,- - I would not allow you to pursue the Ole. They eternally and always have him detention. Ole is the unfortunately very bad in the math. He has everything else in the head. He is a fun, beak little guy. He is a real boy. They must cease to torment him. You only have one childhood. Yes, but you will understand when I pushes a bit with the Ole, - - is it to get him through the exam. They believe he fails? It would just be missing. His father is treasurer, and math is to the family. Does it? They will now not sit Them down and have a cup of tea? No, thank you. But think They Could help to get the Ole a little work harder? He is diligent. Does he not, it is because he has a bad teacher. Lots of children will be stayed in school because their teachers do not understand them. There may be something about that. You can read in any book on child psychology. - You are almighty! Read psychology? - Yes, I do. Now I think I will... I know what They want. They will sit Them and have a cup of tea. No, thank you. I must go now. Goodbye, mr. Stahr. Should I not be allowed to follow Them out? Now, I must. And so, I hope not, I have been here in vain. - No, it has The certainly not. - Thanks. (dog howls) Hey, Dingo! Three! Will They keep the next time? - Yes. Sorry. They beat Them surely not? - They didn't hurt Themselves? - No. Was it not here, the lady was getting off? - What do They say? - Should They not off here? Then thank you, it is not required. I'm running a little with yet. Well. Listen, it was here Snarevej? Well, so I need off. - Good Morning, Sis. - Good Morning, Grethel. - What exciting was it you wanted to tell me? - Now you need to hear. Sis, small Sis. Can I get an icecake? No, don't trouble. You can't get the popsicle each day. Run off. I have to talk with Grete. Per, how is it going to whistle? - I can not. Not yet. Try to let me hear. Get off. - What exciting was it you wanted to tell me? - I met with Paul yesterday. - You think not ...? - Of Course, Reichardt. - Where? - We met on a bus. He spoke to you? - Yes. Until he was getting off. Oh, where may you be happy. You understand how to live life. Not as the rest of us, who are slaves in the school. God, I must run! The time is many. I need to extra course in French. Hey! Christian! Is there something wrong? They have to take the bow from Christian. It is dangerous. He just got it. He is a big boy. Not big enough for a firearm. Let us not be hysterical. It is after all just toys. He has promised to be careful. An accident can happen to anyone. They know not how dangerous it is to inhibit the children in the age. (played on harmonica) Stop with the cat music. I can't hear what I'm even thinking. You go hardly not miss anything. Ih, now to the Sis just to see you. She would probably be mad. Hand me the book. You calculate the best when the blood runs to the head. - Go ahead. You are not really clever. - I'll become. A man sells 476 metres sheet fabric. Have you read in English? What is the meaning of shut up? - Shut up. - One has the well allowed to ask. Ha, ha, ha. - Do you know where Sis stores the answers? - Yes, but I say it is not. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Ssh, it's going to sleep. So, now I'll have to take the answer list. Let me, let me. Here, just watch and see! "I'm so restless, awake and hear my heart beat - - alas, only in the bosom ..." Then, "merciful deep - - I am my beloved reach." - Where is that beautiful. - It's brittle. There is one more. Then, now it's me. "There is a gold rush in the forest. There is sunshine on my way. You must know, gentle harvest, I love you." She is in love with in Hoest. Let me enter the flat of the ladybugs! In our bakery! I think he ought to know it. Love is very strange. - The poems must be many worth the money. - Sis will be able to sell them. If the Harvest came into our family, we could get pastries every day. Av yes, you say something. You know what? One of my pals father writes poems. - He gets 100 crowns for each. - Avra! Ten poems, it is 1,000 crowns. - re you woking or doing nothing up there? - Of course! Hurry up a little. We'd better go and calculate. - Go ahead. - Thank you. - And here you go. - Thank you. - And please. - Thank you. It is too wrong. No, not at all. You have made me very happy. - Goodbye, Harvest. - Goodbye, Little Per. "You must know, gentle Harvest, I love you ..." Inconcivable. Come and buy! Come and buy! Beautiful poems, 1,000 crowns! - What do you have there? - Beautiful poems, 1,000 crowns. - It was expensive. - Let me see. Here you should see the lyric. 1,000 crowns is not a little too much? - Orc-no. - May 25 cents not do it? - Thank you. - Go ahead. - What do you use all the money for? - Icecakes! - Come buy! Come and buy! - Let me get one. Fun, little guy. - Come buy! Come and buy! - What is it you have there? Beautiful poems, 1,000 crowns. - What do they cost? What do they cost? - 1,000 crowns. 1,000 crowns! Listen here: "I'm so restless, awake and hear my heart beat. Only in dream's deep, I can my beloved reach." Here you go. Are you crazy? I must have many more. I must have Ice boats for all the money. Well, I must say! There is almost a whole carton. I fail to understand why the Harvest are giving them cakes. He may well like the children. You have not told me about the iceberg. - There is nothing to tell. - Shame on you, father. You breathed not. I did not dare. I tried several times, but he is always so busy. Well, there you finally are. Where did you find him? Out on the road. Not that far away. It was good. Per, came to the Sis and get a small cake. - No, thank you. - You don't want cake? - He must be sick. - He just has a little stomach ache. - Come, Per. - Why does he have an ache in the stomach? That is why he has stomach ache? Why have you hurt in your stomach? He has probably eaten one or the other. Ice cakes! - Icecakes? Have you eaten several? - Yes. 14. Who has given you money for all the icecakes? - The bad men and ladies. - Why did they do it? I sold the papers. - What the papers sold you? - It was just something we were playing. - I should put him in the bed. - He is just tired. No! We'll probably clear him. In the morning he is fresh as a fish. - Well, however! You found the middle? - Yes, you. And the words. So took Olufsen finally together. No, think, I found this little verse down on the street. Written with pencil on a small scrap. As it was made for the song. - Who has written it? - I don't know. We can further use it? It is the only Children's help day, and it's so neat. Listen to this. The heart pops off on the spring's bud it is a glorious time the air has a scent that takes my common sense? soon bloom love The first day of spring is filled with magic the world sets in with the spring tune every year we see miracles around us happening but every time, it is for the first time, it came the first springsmile the first hyacinth now we let out of the winter's maze and all the flowers hoist the flag, so enjoy to the fullest the lovely first day of spring Uninmaginable. (loud bang) Oh, Per! Now I dreamed just so nice. (Snoring) (bang) (loud exclamations) - Go silent, man. - It is Children's help Day today. So what? We have not even free from school. If I was the king. The king had to help the children such a day, isn't it? Yes, it is crazy. Everything is brittle. You are woken up in the morning, when you are snorly drowsy. And hunted in the night, when one is spring awake. - Seven tin soldiers. - You with your tin soldiers. Back and travel! - Smoke and travel. - Ugh! - You will have a little more, dad? - Yes, thank you, my girl. (the doorbell rings) - I must speak with you. - How are you smart. You need to go with. I have a suit for you here. Birgitte, who sings so well, has been sick. Now is missing. - You don't want? It is fun. - I would like to... Come on in and say hello, little Gretel. - What will little Gretel? - Have me with out the rattle. - But what do we do with Little Per? - Yes, what do we do with Little Per? (the phone rings) Hello? That is not something to laugh about, you the crazy girls. Yes? Good morning, mrs Sejersen, is it Them? It was great, They phoned. I would go for a blow over to Them. Now? Yes but They are so welcome. Yes, about five minutes. Goodbye. (the doorbell rings) Good morning. I has allowed me to take Per with, otherwise he must be home alone. They have often offered Their help, so he is in the best hands. You must excuse me, I'm already late. Goodbye. - Where is Gretel? - Yes, where is Sis? They come there. Hurry up a little! - Howdy, Peter. - Howdy, Sis. It was in the last moment. You must have enough to say. - Howdy, Peter. - Then, Gretel. Welcome on board.
