Promod! Pramod, wait! Come back son. Where are you driving? Father, I got a teaching job at a college in Adarsha .. ... I'm going there. Pramod, I thought you were going to learn something. But I see that you cannot understand what is right and what is not. The only son of a man who employs thousands of servants ... ... will work for just Rs 500 per month? What's the logic? What is the reason? Father, the logic of this, as well as ... ... and the reason is you! What do you mean? Father, I cannot live under the shade of a tree ... ... which instead of protecting me ... ... from the sunlight, blocking out all the light for me. And you can work not because you need ... ... that the desire to work can also be a reason. And who hit me so hard? For whom did I buy so much property? Father, between you and me .... ... that there is too much difference between yesterday and today . Your property is your only wealth ... My knowledge is my property ... ... which I have earned through hard work. Father, how have you been collecting wealth all your life ... ... that's how I collected knowledge only to give. Until now, you have only collected ... ... and now start giving. So you will leave me and my property? Not. The day I left .. ... I gave you a chance to live for today. I am leaving because there is no one around you ... ... who is associated with you ... ... to get you started thinking about those people ... ... who have earned your wealth. Goodbye! Pramod, stop! Pramod, stop! Don't stop even if you are defeated! EXAM Only by traveling through the thorns ... ... you will go to heaven. Don't stop even if you are defeated! Only by traveling through the thorns ... ... you will go to heaven. Oh traveler! Oh traveler! There are no friends, there is no beaten path. This is your exam. There are no friends, there is no beaten path. This is your exam. Just keep walking with courage in your heart. The destination is waiting for you! Listen! Nobody should stop you by giving your name. Oh traveler! Oh traveler! Don't stop even if you are defeated! Only by traveling through the thorns ... You will go to heaven. Oh traveler! Oh traveler! - Is the dean at home? - Yes. "I'm Pramod Sharma." - Pass. Please, friends, make your way. Hema Malini is coming. I, too, stand to look at her. Let's go to! Rahkesh is coming! Go. Why are you so afraid? Coward, I won't go! Who wants to talk to him? We do not avoid him, we want to light his way ... ... not ignite! Go! I'll see what he does? Hey girl? You stand in such a manner that ... ... even if you hit me with a shoe, I won't say anything! I don't need shoes, just a hand! The hand that rises to Rakesh ... ... will be broken! And when my hand touches the girl ... ... do you know what's going on? If you don't know ... ... then ask this question to any girl in your class! Go. Good morning sir. Good morning sir. Good morning, Rita. How are you? Everything is good. How is your father? He's also fine. He is waiting for you for lunch. Tell him I 'll come to him someday. Rita, this is our new teacher, Mr. Pramod Sharma. Pramod, this is the daughter of the council chairman, Rita. - Hello! - Hello! Come on in. This is too much! Why are you throwing tomatoes? Sir, this will make you healthier. Throw it! It's all your father's money ... ... when you start making money on your own , then ... ... you can't throw peanuts either. What is it? What is this noise? Silence! Mr. Fultru. Why did you come alone? I'm all alone. Be silent! Go and get your tool. Why are you standing? Bring your tool. Hey stop! Damn it the moment I became a professor. Well, well, sit down! You know him? - Not! - Our new teacher, Pramod Sharma. - This is Mr. Sen. - Hello. - So you are my roommate? - Yes. - Can I ask? - Sure. What problem drove you to become a teacher at this college? What? People get a job here only when they have problems ?! Students don't study today ... ... they compete with each other and with the professors. If you belong to a good family ... ... better start a small business. But don't work in college! Time to go to class. I must go. Good luck. - He's going to class. - Poor guy. That is why it is necessary for the teacher to be afraid of the students. The teaching will be better and the student will be able to learn. He's coming. You saw? The first step is really important in our life. Some slip and fall ... ... others slide but don't fall ... ... and there are those who neither slip nor fall. With all this in mind, the person who comes in ... ... through this door, enters into a certain relationship with you . I know how a new teacher is welcomed on his first day! And that's why I prepared myself. I ask you to put here ... ... everything that was brought to my lesson. This means that you want to use whatever you bring. You have made me your target. Ok, I agree. Come on, drop it. Nobody can aim well. If someone takes my place ... ... I'll show you how to aim. Come out. Will anyone come out? - Rahkesh, come out! - Yes, get up, Rahkesh! Are you in pain? Rahkesh, sit down here. Sit down. - What a smart man! - Yes. He should be praised. On the first day he taught us a lesson. Now let's study history. Sir, will you tell the story of India or your life? I'm not kidding. Rahkesh asked a smart question. It is most important. Who owns the story? Is she part of this land or the people living on it? I don’t want to say anything else on this subject, except ... ... that you are today as I was yesterday ... ... and today I am what you will be tomorrow. So always keep this in mind. You and I are no different. The new teacher has done an amazing job. He made a good impression. All were silent. And Rahkesh was so humiliated! He was going to become a leader. The new teacher silenced him. Your father is an idiot! What are you talking about? Rahkesh, don't scold my father. Your father... Why are you talking behind my back? Say it to your face. What's up boss? He opposed me in college. Sampat Nayak, I hit you so hard that ... ... Sampat on one side and Nayak on the other. Are you against our boss? I will make you respect him. Leave him, don't kill him. This punishment awaits everyone who opposes Rakesh. If anyone wants more, come up to me in turn. I'm your fan. I know how to fix everything. But let me touch you. Why? What was in the class was not enough for you. Want to hear more? Not only listen, but also see. And you will show me, my love. I am higher than all others. - Shut up! You are not like everyone else! You are better than them. “That's why I want to taste you. - Idiot! Excuse me, sir. The guys are so rude that it's hard to restrain yourself. “The same things happen to young men. - What? Looking at you, no one can blame the young men for forgetting about politeness. Where do you go? I'll take you there. So that the young men would not show their manners. Are you afraid of guys? Not at all. But when I look at them from their point of view ... ... I have to consider everything. - Where are you staying? - In the men's hostel. What if I help you bring the books to you? - Then I cannot refuse. - Thank. Professor Sharma, come in. I am proud of you. Why? You are the only teacher in our college ... ... who managed to control the class the first time around. That's a compliment. The students are very good. There are good and bad students in college. But I rarely saw a new teacher communicate ... ...with them. Understands and knows them. Nice hobby. This is not my hobby. This is my daughter's hobby. All these flowers are grown by her. I just water them. She is very talented. She has a great sense of beauty. Nice hobby. And delicate taste. Bring it here. Wait, I'll go wash my hands. Come on in. You only brought two cups. You didn't tell me you were expecting guests. This is not a guest. This is Professor Sharma. ... which I told you about yesterday. - This is my daughter Madu. - Hello. “You should also have tea with us. - No, I'll have a drink later. My daughter, who loves blossoming flowers so much ... ... has lost its luster in the last few years . Why? She is so young. Too late. A few years ago, standing on the stairs ... ... she slipped and fell. She broke her pelvic bone. We have been treated by many doctors. But she cannot walk normally. But why is she so sad? It was just an accident. And I tell her about it. But she doesn't understand. She was the top artist in the art college. But after the accident, she stopped going to her college ... ... and refused to attend another college. Very sad. But what happened to her paintings after this accident? There are no traces left of them , no one will say, looking ... ... to her that she was a good artist. I managed to hide her last painting. This is Madu's mother. She died when Madu was three years old. Madu began to paint it, saddened by the loss of her mother. Madu understands perfectly ... Dad. Why are you showing him my picture? - Why did you do it? - He wishes you well. - Why did you do it? - He wishes you well. - Why did you do it? - Take it easy. She'll be fine in a minute. She often has tantrums. Let's go to. Let's go inside. I will take you to your room. In the spring everyone wants love. I play with flowers. I like the buds. The whole world is in front of me. In the spring everyone wants love. I play with flowers. I like the buds. The whole world is in front of me. I'll make her agree to the marriage. I've already picked a girl. I'll make her agree to the marriage. I've already picked a girl. I will put her in a golden cage. I will put her in a golden cage. I've already picked a girl. I'll make her agree to the marriage. I've already picked a girl. Truth cannot be hidden behind walls. Paper flowers can never give flavor. I keep on waiting. I give you my heart. I will always love you. But how can I trust you? Your promises are false. Your promises. I will die of your promises. I'm a naive guy. Your promises. Youth is fleeting. Don't stop loving. Youth is fleeting. Don't stop loving. Just love me. Youth is fleeting. Don't stop loving. Just love me. Youth is fleeting. Don't stop loving. You broke my heart like a toy. You broke my heart like a toy. Who are you leaving me to? You broke my heart like a toy. What happened? Why are you sitting like that? - A miracle. - Miracle, what a miracle? The girl that all the guys are trying to get their eyes on ... ... the same girl came to give away your books on the first day. How do you call it, if not a miracle. What pills did you give her? Tell me. I would give them to someone else, but not to her. First, state the name of the medicine. Then I will say her name. - Tell you? - Yes. - "Dzira" tablets. - Dzira pills, good. This soup is watery. It used to be thicker. These vegetables are not fresh! These vegetables are not fresh! But who are you protesting against? Against leadership. You have to change everything or we will go on strike. - This is really bad. - But they manage to mess. No, sir. Rahkesh and his friends rule here . But what can I do about it? You can change management to hold new elections. We sympathize with you. I’ll talk about it with the administration. If you don't agree, we'll go on a hunger strike. We will go on a hunger strike. We will go on a hunger strike. Eat faster, otherwise we 'll have to go on hunger strike too . Get started. - What happened? - I'm not in the mood. You are not in the mood! Then I'll eat. Well, you idiots complained? Get out of the way, Rahkesh. We will not eat stuff. Even your father will eat this dinner and praise it. You will now receive for going against Rahkesh. What will happen now? I will take revenge on everyone who complained about me. Master, rather. The guys turned off the light. - How can I help? - Please come, sir! Go and tell the principal or call the police. Go away. The lights are off, and you don't want to go out? Stop it all! Aren't you from this college? Who are you? I know him. He is a photographer. He is a friend of Rakesh. He is the owner of a photo studio. I came to give away the negatives. You must be ashamed! Strangers came, turned off the lights in the hostel ... ... and you tell me that you know nothing! I want to know where these bullies come from ? I know only one of them - a photographer. He came to give me the photos. He was also beaten. Rahkesh, don't think that I am blind and dumb. I know what's going on in college. We have forgiven your hooligan antics many times ... ... but there is a limit to everything. You forced me to take severe measures against you. I think Rakesh should be given a warning. I am of the same opinion. If we call the police, it will be a bad name. This is how they get support. Okay, I'll clean up the committee. I give you one last warning. You can leave. Gee! He fought as Dharmendra last night . Dharmendra fought to get Hema Malini ... ... but Hema Malini isn't here? What are you saying? She is no worse than Hema Malini. She is angry. She didn't speak to me for two days! But, sir, if she lives as before ... ... she won't be able to live normally. Whenever she is in a good mood, she says something nice. She doesn't even limp. But mostly she is sad and crying. It seems to me that there is only darkness in her life. I am depressed. I do not know who will teach her to live? I doused you. You didn't pour me over, I just washed my face. Don't you know that I haven't had a bath today? - I know. - Then ... ... Do you mean that you should only enter your house after washing? I thought you came on business. This was the case, but not to your father, but to you. To your flowers, your gardens. If you do not mind... You live in this world of flowers ... ... but you have to find an even more beautiful place. Is there a place that is even more beautiful than flowers? Human heart. You offended. Not. This is so strange. The person who grows flowers hates paint. Everyone can change the color of clothes, but flowers never change colors. They bloom and die being the same color. You say this because you have not yet seen the flowers of love. This color changes everything around. Let's leave this conversation. You won and I lost. Having arrived here, I decided to find out one secret. What? They say that no one knows when the flower will bloom ... But I bet everything you touch blooms. Please sit down. I'll bring you tea. To a man whose eyes are enchanted ... ... and my head is spinning from the scent ... ... no tea needed. It will seem stale to him. If you refuse, they will wither. What is the occasion? Not only me, but the whole college is happy. You have done an excellent job. You dealt with the hooligans ... I would be much happier if you said that ... ... I am a good teacher. If the teacher is a hero, then the study becomes more interesting. But a teacher cannot be a hero ... ... and a hero cannot be a teacher. But he can be a worshiped teacher . But the teacher has no fans. But isn't that ... They don't listen to us. If they listen to us, the atmosphere in college will change. I'd like to check out. - I'll go too. - Let me see. They are beautiful. So fragrant ... ... but there are also thorns. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 ... - We found ... - The scapegoat. No, I'm not going anywhere with you. I don't need company. But we want it. I will die. That is why, Ram is the truth! Ram is the truth! - Boss! - We found a scapegoat. Why are you holding him in your arms? Drop it down! He received a money order from his father. Let's have a good party. No, Rahkesh. This money for study ... ... I cannot spend them. I will not be able to pass the exams! You have to give them away. Rahkesh must bring in first ... ... you will deposit later. Rakesh, photos have arrived from Ranjit. What a beauty! Good! Let it print more. Come on, Munna, let's have some fun. No, Rahkesh, this is the money I owe ... ... put on a deposit otherwise I will die. We will support you. You will have fun with us. Let's go to. What have you brought? I know you hate these things ... ... but I decided it was time to awaken the artist in you. I ask you. Please get them out of here. The artist you want to wake up is not asleep, but dead. What will you get from a dead body? Believe me, I am your friend, not your enemy. You will have to help me ... ... and I can help you. Enter them. They hurt me. They make me go crazy. Madu, they're not crazy. It is pain and hatred in you. Madu, look here. These things are calling you. Just look, don't think, just look. Don't let bitter memories overwhelm your creativity. You don't know, Mr. Pramod ... ... that there is so much pain in these memories ... ... that I can't breathe. So share the pain. Give it to me. You! Yes, Madu, I want you to share your pain. I don't know what you are thinking. What do you understand? I just think it's ... ... the consequences of that accident .. There were not one, but two accidents. - Two! - Yes, two. One destroyed my body, and the other my peace. I do not understand. You told me... ... that I have not seen the color of love ... ...You are wrong. I saw the colors of love ... ... with which I was flooded. He was an Air Force officer. We loved each other very much. Madhu! Madhu. Bad news came. Vijaya's plane was out of order. His brother told me. Not... Madhu! Madhu! But death took him away from me ... I passed out and fell down the stairs. I was desperate, but I did not die. I apologize, Madu. But death, like an accident ... ... no one can control. Life can fix tomorrow ... ... and lead to light ... "... but I decided it was time to awaken the artist in you." "... but I decided it was time to awaken the artist in you." - Take a look, dad. - Very well. - I remembered my mother. - Yes. Today I am very happy that you are drawing again. You are happy, I do not want more. What happened? I want to paint your portrait. Portrait? There is still time. What do you say? Why do you need my portrait? Draw Pramod. Are you joking. My dear father never played badminton ... ... and I'm in charge of sports at this college. What do I know about sports? I worship beauty. That is why I called Pramod Sharma for help . When will the team roster be announced? In the near future. In the near future. - But when? - Very soon! When will we know about the team? You idiot, get out of here! We want to know the names of the selected players. I came to tell you about it. I selected the team according to the style of play. The guys will be represented ... ... Mr. Chandan Mishra ... ... Mr. Pritam Kapoor ... ... Mr. Harbans Singh ... ... and Mr Manoj Jane ... The girls will be represented ... ... Madam Suda Malhotra ... ... Mr. Roshan Thakur ... ... Mrs. Usha Nadkarni ... - And ... - The beauty queen of our college Ms. Rita! No, this year Ms. Sushma Khanna will replace Ms. Rita. Nyack, you have my book. Where's she? Let me sleep. Get out of here! Nyak, are you drunk? Nyak, wake up ... - Sir, you ... - Are you drunk? Tell me the truth. Excuse me. Tell me where did you drink? Rahkesh made me drink. Nobody made you drink. You are lying! Trust me, I am telling the truth. Rahkesh is afraid that someone will break out of his claws ... ... and he goes broke. His business will be destroyed. What kind of business? Not ... Nothing. - Tell me! He sells alcohol in the dorm ... ... drugs and pictures of naked girls. Since when has he been doing this? A long time ago. Why did not you tell me? - I'm afraid of him. - Come with me. - Where? - To Rakesh's room. I'm afraid of him. Where is Rahkesh? The chin. Down a bit. Does not work! Wait, I'll see. Turn your head here and look there. This hand is here, and this is there ... Now this hand ... Don't change position. Look there. Quiet, otherwise it will hurt. Remove this fabric, it ruins the whole look. Remove this fabric or whatever will happen to our business. How much will you mock me. Amazing. This girl is very boring. You won't look at her if you don't drink ... ... just look at her. We're just getting started, honey. - Boss! - Who's there? Sharma searched your room. This professor will ruin everything. Rahkesh is not a child either. You will see what awaits this professor ... Idiot! I ask for the last time. If I was elected last year, why not this year? And I ask about this? Everything will be good. Go. Pandit, if I didn't choose Rita, what is she doing inside? Mr. Sharma, when it comes to the daughter of a rich man ... ... then he is not chosen. This is politics. My impression. You will not understand what I am saying. I understand everything, but I don't want to know. This is injustice, flattery and corruption. I want to play fair ... ... or you shouldn't have invited me. Amazing! Honest Harishchandra. Look who's coming! Let it come. I'm on fire today. I'll break his legs. Be carefull. - Let's play football. - No, I'm tired. Come on, sir. Now I know why you wanted me to play. Why are you not enjoying yourself , sir ? Rahkesh, I know what's going on in college. I am silent because I think about your parents. Go. What's happening? What is it? Help! Help! He will kill me! What's up, Mr. Sen? - He will kill me! - Who will kill you? What's the matter? Say something! He will kill me! - Who will kill you? - Rahkesh. - How? - With a knife! - Big! - Big, shiny, sharp! Why are you wasting your time? Tell us what happened! I caught him with a cheat sheet under the table. Tell me why are you so afraid? I also speak. Rahkesh pulled out a knife ... ... to kill me. - To kill you! If you are brave then go see ... ... there is a knife. - Go, go. - I don't want to die. Rakesh, everything has its time. And the place. All you need now is a pen, not this knife. It looks like you need the book too. That's why I won't take it. Some of you are cheating on the class. I think those who do not cheat are at a disadvantage. So those who want can take their books or accept help. I am not kidding. I'm talking seriously. Mr. Sharma, is it true? Why did you do this? I teach history. I will find out who cheated and who did not! Your intelligence demeans this college. Or proves that we are not doing our job! Who said you are not doing your job? The facts tell us that we must change over time. - Can I ask you something? - Ask. Don't you prepare daily before class? Yes, we are preparing. This is why students listen to us. You do it! This is my point of view ... ... if we don't prepare and answer questions ... ... looking at a book ... ... then we can only answer 2 questions within an hour. The same way... ... only he can answer 5 questions within an hour ... ... who prepared. A fraudster will waste time surreptitiously peeping into a book. You are committing an offense disguised as a student. I do not understand. Don't consider yourself the smartest. If I want, I can report you! You will be thrown out of college, you will not go to university. No, sir, please. Rahkesh, it's my job to show you the right path ... ... and you have to obey me. If you go wrong again ... ... I promise you that you will repent. Why didn't you come to play badminton? I know you are angry, but please say something! I came here to teach history, not play badminton. You think I'm on the team because of my father. Believe it is not true. I wanted to be on the team ... ... but didn’t know that your decision would be reversed. Professor Bridjhushan did it himself ... ... neither I nor my father asked for him. You are the daughter of the chairman of the Council, which is why he did it. Otherwise he would not have done this. Am I to blame for this? If you want to punish me ... ... then kick me out of the team. But those players who want to play ... ... want to know why you are punishing them? You're right, Rita. Because because of you, I punish others. I'll come tomorrow. - Thank you, thank you very much! Finally, then you left your house. Do you want to ask why I left? And who did I get out of? You look happy, that's enough. Why did you come here? The thirsty man comes to the well ... ... not only to drink water ... ... he goes out to people. It may also happen that a person may get drunk elsewhere. Madu, I was so busy that I couldn't come even if I wanted to. Whether you want it or not, I have come to you. Okay, I'll change and come. Everyone in college is so glad you came. You look wonderful. This is all the merit of Mr. Sharma. Who can fix everything. I received a compliment. - You have to get it. - For what? If someone can bring life ... ... life in a fading color, isn't he worthy of compliments? But some flowers consider themselves wilted due to the cold. They have both color and scent. This is a good joke. No Madu, I never joke. I see how you have changed. This is what I wanted. Seeing this colorful world again, I don't want to leave it again. This shouldn't happen. But for this I need a good model. It doesn't matter, there are many models. Dad also talked about the model. Who is he? He's very good! But you have to try to make him sit. Just tell me and I'll bring him. This is not necessary, he is next to me. Okay, but no. Punish me somehow else, but not like that. It's hard to get me to sit back for hours. Why? You know the professor has so many responsibilities. I am also one of your responsibilities. Pramod, sit there! There! - What happened? - Hot. Not so, sit up straight. How do I sit? Can it stand? Not so, come back. Sit down. Take off your glasses. Turn your face. A little to the side. Down a bit. Like this. Now don't move. You turned again. Sit up straight. Take off your glasses. You turned again. Sit up straight. Good book. If you sit like that, I will never finish the picture. Why? The expression on your face changes. Now you laugh, then you are sad ... Now you sit, then you lie down. How will I finish the painting? This is called life! Is not it? Only death can fix a facial expression. Not in the mood. What's the matter, Rita? Who are you looking for? Who else will she be looking for besides Mr. Sharma ... But this adorable handsome guy is looking at someone else. - Today is her birthday. - But ... But .... ... he's gone! - Where? - I dont know... ... I saw him with Madu. - Madu? Enough. I won't go anymore! You are breaking your promise. After I climb the stairs and win. But now... And now! Even now, you can win. You comfort well. But you don't need any consolation or support ... I believe that you will not give up and will be able to climb the stairs. Isn't it too difficult a task? I am confident in your strength. Get up Madu. You shouldn't have believed in me. I tried but I failed. You have not lost, you have won. Evening comes every day. But never like today. Clouds float every day. But never like today. Evening comes every day. But never like today. Clouds float every day. But never like today. Who came into my life? Evening comes every day. But never like today. Clouds float every day. But never like today. What kind of flowers are there? I want to hold them close to me. What kind of flowers are there? I want to hold them close to me. Sweet mischievous wind ... ... touches and tickles me. Someone is singing softly ... ... making me yearn for love. Makes me dream. Makes me dream. Who came into my life? Evening comes every day. But never like today. Clouds float every day. But never like today. Bright colors are everywhere. Wherever I see. Bright colors are everywhere. Wherever I see. Who came into my life? Evening comes every day. But never like today. Clouds float every day. But never like today. But never like today. Rita, what are you doing here? Don't you know that men are swimming at this time! Mr. Sharma, I am the special daughter of a special person. I can break many rules. The rules are not written separately for special people and separately for ordinary people. They are the same for everyone. Since you broke the rules, I have to report it. Okay, do it. Regardless of the punishment. Now that I have come ... Why are you leaving? Please, stop. You are afraid of me? No, I'm not afraid of you! But I don't want you to ignore the rules. You did something very important today. This is why the stars favor me. Rita the crazy from Pramoda Sharma. And when Rita wants someone, even God cannot save him. The situation will not be better for us. What do you think? Boss, now what do we do? We must arrange for the spark to become a flame. We have to convince Rita to throw a party. Few will be invited to this party. It will be private. This expectation is so disappointing. He is a teacher. He only knows how to teach. What does he know about waiting? Rita, you should have brought him with you. That's what I wanted. But what could I do? - The rector called him! - And he went. Yes, but he promised that he would be on time. It seems that it was not the rector, but his daughter. Where did it come from? Just let it appear. Then something will happen. After a long time. Now we will rest. Come to us. Hello Rita! Let's go to. What's the matter with you, Rita? Why are you so upset? Is it because Madu came with me or am I late? Listen Rita, I came with Madu ... ... and if you mind, I'll leave the party. No, please don't go. That's not why we threw a party. If you leave, life will be gone. Then let's go, everyone is waiting for us. Let's go to. Today you have to sing, Madu. Take these glasses and look at everyone in them. Look at me dear. I'm just waiting for one of your eyes. But listen to your sweetheart. Why should she ask for something? Look at me dear. I'm just waiting for one of your eyes. But listen to your sweetheart. Why should she ask for something? Look at me dear. Look at me dear. You live in my heart. Whether we will meet or not. You live in my heart. Whether we will meet or not. I gave you my heart. Whether we will meet or not. The moment has come. This heart is empty. I hold my heart, but it runs away. Look at me dear. I'm just waiting for one of your eyes. But listen to your sweetheart. Why should she ask for something? Look at me dear. Look at me dear. When you don't look at me ... ... I might die. When you don't look at me ... ... I might die. Our meeting is priceless. Don't try to set a price. Our meeting is priceless. Don't try to set a price. I'm tired of hearing ridicule. Look at me dear. I'm just waiting for one of your eyes. But listen to your sweetheart. Why should she ask for something? Look at me dear. Look at me dear. Look at me dear. Look at me dear. Sir, let's play darts. Young men often tease girls. You shouldn't be upset. - It's all because of you. - Because of me! Because you came uninvited. You ruined my party. Sorry if I knew this would happen ... ... I wouldn't come. I know what's the matter. You did it deliberately so that ... ... everyone knew that you loved Pramod. No, Rita, it is not. I know what's going on between you and Pramod. But remember that Pramod is mine! I love him. If you try to come between us ... ... I'll break your other leg. What happened to Madu? Are you okay? Nothing special. She fell off the swing. - Does it hurt? - Not. Rest, I'll go home. I'll take you home. Let's go to. Well done, Rita. Now she will not contradict you. Do you think Pramod loves her? Not at all. Pramod only regrets her. You make him dance to your tune. What can I do? I've tried so much ... He's so reserved. Nothing will happen here! Take him on a tour. Mr., try to understand me. I have a wife and a child at home. I will not be able to go on a tour. You have made a fool of me many times . But this time I will not go. Then who will go? Nothing. We talked about the trip. I'm a family man and Sen is a bachelor. Tell me who should go? Professor Bridgmohan is right. You must go. But I... Don't you know where we are going? - Where? - To see the love statues. Love statues! Then I'll go. Thank. Madu, you're hiding something. What's the matter? Why are you sad again? The bloom was fake. Withering is a reality. Do not you know... ... that a wilted flower will never bloom again. I can not understand... Listen, I'm on a field trip. Come with me. Not! I don't want to go anywhere. Even with me? No, no one! But why? Why don't you want to come with me? I have no right to your happiness. I'm just me. My wounds, memory, pain, they are only mine ... ... they don't touch anyone! Please sit in an empty seat. If someone falls asleep, you have to ride while standing. If you don't like this place, then take my ... ... I will change. Sing us a song in Bengali. When I was young, I sang better than Rabindra Sangeet. If I sing now, this car will stop on the road. Why do you want to ruin the tour before you take photos? Let me take photos. Sir, is this a camera? Idiot, this is a lens. This is a camera. - What is this lens? - Great lens. Can we see through the clothes through it ? You idiot, with it you will see more clearly. Oh my God! What will happen to me? I have to take photos. Take a picture of us. If I spend film on you, how can I photograph the statues. Where can I get more? She will be angry. Everyone is angry with me. I have no medicine for Pramod. - Jira pills? - Tablets "Jira"! All the girls are crazy about Pramod because he uses these pills. Where is Mr. Sharma? Why did sculptors make such statues before ? There were no books or newspapers before , so to teach how to love ... ... they made statues. But looking at these statues is uncomfortable for me. This is our test. Those who want to be saints ... ... have been tested by these statues. But today these statues are considered taboo. Why? Then sex was not considered a sin. Man was not a slave to lust. Today he is a slave to lust. This is why it is considered a sin. Do you also think about sex by looking at them? When I look, I don't think. I'm just watching. Not true. You don't even look. Put out the fire! I'm on fire. Don't know how it happened? My body is on fire. Come here dear! My body is on fire. Put out the fire! I'm on fire. Don't know how it happened? My body is on fire. Come here dear! My body is on fire. Put out the fire! My wounded heart. I'll show it to you. I'm surrounded by fire. It's so hard for me to live. You do not know... ... live or die. Tell me what is my mistake? Why torture me! Put out the fire! I'm on fire. I don’t know how it happened? My body is on fire. Come here dear! My body is on fire. Put out the fire! As soon as evening comes ... ... my heart starts to beat faster. Until the morning I cannot sleep, I dream of you. I say your name and sigh. If not, what should I do? How can I relax? Put out the fire! I'm on fire. Don't know how it happened? My body is on fire. Come here dear! My body is on fire. Put out the fire! You! So late at night. What happened? I lost my diamond earring. She must have fallen while I was dancing. I'm scared to go alone. Please come with me! How are we going to look for her at night? We'll look in the morning. She's very expensive. If someone finds it, they will not give it to me. I have a flashlight. It will be visible. Believe me. You won't be able to find her now. Let's look in the morning. If I don’t find the earring, then dad will be angry. Rita, don't insist. I already told you. - I beg you! - What are you doing? I'm afraid of my father. These are very expensive earrings. If I don't find them ... First of all, you shouldn't have put on an expensive item on the train. OK, let's go! You’re wasting your time, you’ll find nothing in such darkness. It all depends on the person's vision. If the eye is sharp, he can find it. I do not think so. Look around. Diamonds shine in the light. Do not go there. Come here! Look! I told you we should search in the morning. I lost her somewhere here. We'll find her soon. But, Rita ... What happened? - Does it hurt? - Yes! Help! Help! Rita's rape! Rita's rape! Down with Pramoda Charm! Down with Pramoda Charm! Pramod Sharma is a scoundrel! We don't know how to teach? Is this a teaching? This is a new century, a new experiment, a new wave ... ... all these new things. There is pornography everywhere. This happens in our films as well. One vulgarity. Are you talking about movies? She'll be in schools tomorrow! After school she will come to the house. You will soon see ... ... that women will harass men on the road. But Panditji, he must be stopped. Of course! Everyone is discussing what Pramod Sharma did ... ... but when a girl like Rita comes into your room half naked ... ... will you hug her like your daughter? What dirty thoughts! What shamelessness. Come on, Mr. Sen. But Pandita, that is a smart idea. At least in this situation, I will do it. This is not in our interest. My wife always says ... ... that it is a sin to admit truth for falsehood . Hello! Who is it? What did you decide with Professor Sharma? I think this case should be investigated by the police. I don't think you should report it to the police. The honor of the family, the life of the girl: everything will be ruined. Rita is as dear to me as Madu. Then tell me what should I do? Come tomorrow. I will call Pramod. Good! Daughter, I know what you are experiencing! Do you want to say something in excuse? We hope that you will speak the truth. I'm sorry, but you could not recognize me ... ...to understand me. I just want to say that what you think of as true ... ... it's a lie. I don't want to say anything else. Are you saying that my daughter lied? All the students lied !? I call a spade a spade. I won't say anything else. Why don't you want to talk? If you are innocent, you must tell the truth. Not worth it. If a lie is recognized as a lie ... ... how I can prove I am innocent. Even if I agree that this is all a lie ... ... but the law will hold it true. You have witnesses. How do you believe that I am telling the truth ... ... since I don't have a single witness. You agree to everything. Mr. President, everything that happened that night ... ... was between me and Rita. If you want to know the truth, call Rita here. I'll talk to her. My daughter will never come to a villain like you. She told me ... ... how you pestered her that night. Pramod, Rita is not coming here. You have to explain everything. Rita is my student. I am her teacher. If the truth can scare a student, then don't say it's my duty. What is it? This is all a lie. Someone is behind it all. Yes, my daughter is a liar, all students are liars ... The whole world is lying, these photos are lies. Are our eyes deceiving us? Sir, even you believe it? I never thought of you this way. I am disappointed in you. I don’t want to listen to any explanation. Get out of here. Thank God the Chairman agreed. What? This case will not be reported to the police ... Pramod will leave college after retirement. What about blaming Pramodu? We decided to settle everything. There is no point in compromising. Does this mean you have doubts about Pramod? He was allowed to retire and leave college. Did he agree to resign? Doesn't he love his career! Maybe he won't think about his career ... ... if you can prove that he is innocent! He will have to leave. Don't give him a chance! It's about college prestige. A difficult decision has to be made. It's a matter of honor. How can a shameless man be a teacher? Don't stop even if you are defeated! Only by traveling through the thorns ... ... you will go to heaven. Don't stop even if you are defeated! Only by traveling through the thorns ... ... you will go to heaven. Oh traveler! Oh traveler! Time makes new wounds These are the obstacles on the path of life. Time makes new wounds These are the obstacles on the path of life. Give people everything you know. You will only have dreams. If you stay with no one , why are all your dreams ... I'd like to check out. I won't ask why? I won't ask where? But why don't you prove that a lie is a lie? When so many people prove that the truth is a lie ... ... how can I prove this to be true. You're not alone. Who is with me? Your father doesn't believe me either, and you ... You never understood me. I was slandered. Kicked out of college ... I know everything. You have been slandered. Anyone can accept this lie ... ...but not me! I know you, I understand you. I love you. Madhu! Don't think about me ... ... don't worry about me ... ... but a heart that beats for honor and truth ... ... don't let him stop. Remember how you told me ... ... that tomorrow can fix everything ... ... and shed light on the past. Madu, I lost my way ... ... but your love showed me the way. I believe that together we will tell the truth ... ... to this city. Yes, Madu. I'll go to the professor. "I know what's going on between you and Pramod." "But remember that Pramod is mine! I love him." - Shagun. - Yes, sister. - Will you come with me? - Yes. Here's 500 rupees. For Rakesh. There is nothing else I can do. But this is not enough. What else can I do? Why do n't you meet him alone? No, I'm not going anywhere. Get out of here quickly. Sister, both girls went there. It looks like Rahkesh is there. Ranjit, take 500 rupees. You will get the rest later. You must first give all the negatives. Listen, you want me to give for 500 what is 5000. Don't worry, it's a golden goose. Rita is coming here tomorrow. Take a picture of her in any position. You will receive 5000 rupees for this. I don't want to get involved in all this. I am a businessman. And Professor Sharma is still in town. Do you know what he will do tomorrow? Take the negatives and give me my money. Ok, I agree. We'll exchange the negatives for money tomorrow. On one condition. Money is in one hand and negatives in the other. Resolved. Who's there? What's the matter, Rahkesh? Enough. Rahkesh is different today. Other! Don't you know that no one can dictate to Rahkesh! You do not obey me, even if you know about everything? Are you taking sleeping pills? Dad restricted my movement. I can't date anyone. Very well! How did you come here now? When you ran after the professor ... ... then you didn't think about your father? Behave within limits, Rahkesh! You insult my father. I am not your slave. I am a slave to your beauty, queen. But you know Rakesh. Who doesn't know a bully and a drunkard? You gave me another title. Besides, I'm a blackmailer. Congratulations. When did you receive this title? From the moment I saw you. It's not easy to get Rita. Stop dreaming. Yes, I can stop. But on one condition. Under what condition? I need some money. Not much - only 5000 rupees. - 5000! - Only 5000 ... ... and if I don't receive this money ... ... you will have to rethink your whole life. But where do I get so much money? I dont know. I'll wait for you. Bring the money as soon as possible. And remember, you have to do what I tell you ... ... go wherever I call. Or ... Ask them! Whatever you say, Pramod ... I believe Rahkesh is blackmailing Rita. No, Madu, it can't be. Rita is a strong girl. She will not fall into the hands of Rakesh. Even if I agree with you, what does Rahkesh do ... ... scares Rita. There is something. But what? You said there was a photographer with Rakesh . - Yes. - And he asked about money? I'll be back. One to one. You? What are you doing here? What are you watching? What's in your hands? My photos. Give it back. Now! Tell me where the negatives from these photos are. What are the negatives? - You know well. - Tell me. - I'll tell you everything. The negatives were given away. This is the owner's order. What do you mean? I gave the negatives to Rahkesh. Come with me. Now we will see Pramod Sharma. So professor, you came here to teach. No, Rahkesh, he came for negatives. Now you know everything. Rahkesh, there is still time. Change your path. I need negatives ... ... give them to me. Rahkesh never gives up his sources of income. You think it's strength, power. Power comes from the soul, mind and intellect. And you have none of this. I never liked these sermons, even in class. Let's talk about work, what will you be? Whiskey, brandy, rum, marijuana, opium ... ... and yes, if you want, you can get girls. Now you will receive negatives ... Idiot, where are the negatives? In the box. I was accused of molesting Rita. And the evidence was the testimony of witnesses ... ... and some photos. These photos prove that I molested Rita ... ... and that's why I was asked to resign. But before I leave, I want to ask you ... ...what is it? - Mr. Sharma - What is this joke? I'm not kidding. These are real photos. You can take a look at them. I don't even know who this girl is. I have never seen this girl either. Did I say that you know these girls? Or that you had a relationship with them? I just wanted to show these pictures ... What are you talking about? Show us too. Fuck these pictures. You cannot denigrate us. So you agree that I 'm trying to slander you. But you do not agree that someone is trying to blacken me. What do you mean? I'll tell you, chairman. Please note. The negatives you see ... But this photo is not from one negative ... ... but out of two negatives. I'll show you. Here's one negative ... ... and here's the second one. Likewise, Ritina and my photographs were not taken with one ... ... but out of two negatives. This is a photo, and this is a negative. What about witnesses? It was also similar. Now I want to show you reality. Please call Mrs. Rita. What for? Because she will tell the truth. Why did you ask me to look for earrings at 2 am ... ... and not someone else? I trusted you more than others. How much were your earrings worth? 7 thousand. This is a small amount for you! When I said we would look for them during the day ... ... why did you insist on finding them only at night? You didn't want to look for them during the day! Tell me, did I bring you to the place where you danced? Not. Then what did you do? You came too close to me and stared ... ... and I was looking for my earring. But what happened after that? You grabbed my hand. Later! I asked you to let go of my hand. Later! You did not listen to me and tore my blouse. - I tore my blouse? - Yes. What color was the blouse? Red, blue, yellow, green, which one? Yellow. If I remember correctly, you weren't wearing a sari that night ... ... and a nightdress. She was orange. You tore your nightgown. Does that mean my memory is better than yours? No, it’s not. I'm really nervous. Scared? You were afraid then, not now! What happened next? I screamed! Before or after the shirt was torn ? After! - Do you remember well? - Yes! Do you remember well? Ms. Rita, you must not be afraid. There are so many people around! If you screamed the moment I touched you ... ... you should have screamed before I touched you. And this photo ... ... please take a close look. It was taken by Professor Sena while Rita was dancing. And she wasn't wearing any earrings. Rita, you're lying. This photo proves that you are not telling the truth. Will you tell me again that I tore your nightgown? That I was chasing you? I wanted to rape you? You have to tell the truth. Tell me the truth. Speak! Please forgive me. Please forgive me. It is not your fault. It is not your fault. I wanted to get you at any cost. I lost my mind because of you. It was kind of crazy. And that evening ... What happened? Are you in pain? - Yes - Where? Here. Rita, what nonsense is this. Do not leave me. I love you. Come to your senses. It's true. Mr. Chairman, I came here with great hopes. But I apologize for not being able to do anything. You said that you have good and bad students ... ... but we don't know how to teach bad students . You couldn't understand your students. You trusted them, those who slandered me. These students must be punished. This is my opinion. This is my resignation letter. Promod! Even if the sun stops ... ... I will worship you. Even if the sun stops ... ... I will worship you. There are no friends, there is no beaten path. This is your exam. Just keep walking with courage in your heart. The destination is waiting for you! Oh traveler! Don't stop even if you are defeated! Only by traveling through the thorns ... ... you will go to heaven. Oh traveler! Oh traveler! Oh traveler! NOT FOR SALE!
