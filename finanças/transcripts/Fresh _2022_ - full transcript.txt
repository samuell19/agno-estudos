"Oh, it was so romantic before our first date, y'all. "He texted me: 'FYI, this place is cash only.'" -(CHUCKLES) -No. (NOA GROANS) I'm already here. Girl... I'm really fuckin' hungry. Mmm.

(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Bye-bye. -(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Bye! -(CHUCKLES) (INHALES DEEPLY) Okay, let's do this. (WATER BUBBLING) CHAD: (MUFFLED) So I love hot sauce. I literally just put it on every single thing I can find around the house sometimes. From pizza to chicken wings. (CHUCKLES) Even though it gives me terrible acid reflux. It makes its way up to my throat and I literally feel like I'm gonna vomit. -So... -Oh, yeah. That, um, sucks. -Mmm. -But I love it, so... -(CHUCKLES) Yeah. -Yeah. Like, I love wasabi, but, um, Mexican spices -would be too much for me. -Mmm. -Yeah. I get that. -Yeah. Yeah. Mmm. (CHUCKLES) (CHUCKLES) What? I had this crazy thought. I... I just feel like... the women in our parents' generation, they just cared more about how they dressed and just, kind of, how they looked. They were more into femininity. -You know what I mean? -Mmm. Like, nowadays, I feel like girls, they just wear oversized everything, like it's a blanket. Do you know what I mean? You know what I'm saying, right? -Um... -It's like... 'Cause I think you would just look great in a dress. Not that you don't look good in a sweater, -but I mean, if you were... -WAITRESS: You guys okay? Uh, yeah. Um, pretty much done, actually. Thank you. Cool. Yeah, we'll just get this wrapped up then. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Oh, did you bring cash? Yeah. You reminded me, so... My brother is coming into town. If it's cool, I'm just gonna snag these leftovers and, uh, I guess I'll just let you leave... Cool. No. Yeah. ...a couple bucks less on the tip. If that makes sense. Your scarf is dipping into the noodles. Oh, fuck! Shit! I love this scarf. Um... Excuse me? Excuse me. Quick, come. Hi, do you have sparkling water? -Sparkling. -Mmm-hmm. Yeah. -Bubble. You know bubbles? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. And a lemon, please? I don't know if she understood what I said. I don't think she speaks English. (MEAT SIZZLING) (BELL JINGLES) That was, uh, that was fun.

Instead I just stood there like an idiot. -Let's switch. -Yeah. I don't know how you do it, Mollie. Do what? Dating people. And I always end up alone. Which, by the way, I'm very okay with. No, no. What? You do not need a man, okay? Or anybody, for that matter. It's just the way we've been raised since fuckin' Disney movies. -Yeah. Fuck Ariel. (CHUCKLES) -Fuck her.

Like, I'm already thinking about the fact -he hasn't texted. -Mmm. That's one of the things I love about dating women. Less games, more emotional dependence, you know?

Oh, by the way, um, do you remember Paul? -Paul? -He was our bartender. Oh, yeah. Aw, Paul! You know, I don't remember why we stopped hooking up. He was a good guy. And a good kisser, too. Probably because you can't be tamed. -(CHUCKLES) -You need to roam free. That is true. All right, well, I gotta get back to work. I love you. -Okay, love you more. Bye! -Bye! NOA: You have to try these short ribs, they're insane. Yeah, they look really good, but I, um... I just don't eat animals. NOA: Oh! But... But keep eating. Don't... Don't stop.

ANN'S SON: Mom, I made it! (SIGHS) -(DOOR SLIDES OPEN) -STEVE: Extra cherries. You've earned it. Oh, fuck. (SIGHS) I'm so tired. Woke up at 2:00 a.m. last night going, "Really? Now?" (SIGHS) I had to be up at 6:00. Then you know you're not going back to sleep. You're up fuckin' three hours later. How are the meds? Great, great, great. Still in denial? Yeah. Well... Look, it's gonna take a little time, but eventually you're gonna learn to accept that things don't always turn out the way you thought they would. You know, we all die. But it's really just how we decide to go out. Why did you sleep with me, Steve? (CLICKS TONGUE) I told you, I, um... I told you, I liked you. Anyway, it was a mistake. (STEVE GRUNTS, SIGHS) All right, try to relax. Fear and stress isn't good for the meat. (DOOR SLIDES OPEN) (DOOR SLIDES CLOSE, LOCK CLICKS) (SIGHS) NOA: Penny? Penny, please, just answer already. Please, Penny. Penny! PENNY: What do you want? Oh, fuck. Jesus. Now, was that so hard? (NOA SIGHS) PENNY: (SHAKILY) I'm done, Noa. (EXHALES) No, you're not. (PENNY CRIES, SIGHS) I don't even know who I am anymore. (PENNY CRYING) I hope he fucking chokes. And then he gets a fucking tapeworm. (BOTH CHUCKLE) And it just eats him from the inside, slowly. And that all his weirdo friends shit and puke out of their eyes till they all fucking die. You're such a sweetheart, Penny. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Just... stay strong. Okay? -I'll get you those nuts. -Thanks. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS) (CHUCKLES) (DOOR BELL CHIMES) ANN: (OVER INTERCOM) Whatever you're selling, I'm not interested. Oh, no. I'm not selling anything. Sorry. (CLEARS THROAT) My name is Mollie, and... ANN: Do I know you? No. But I'm looking for my friend, Noa, and I was hoping you could help me. I think your husband might know her. It really should only take a minute. (ANN SIGHS) You do realize how strange that sounds, right? Yes, I do, and, um... I don't really know how to say this, but, um... I think she may have been seeing your husband. What are you talking about? (DOOR SLIDES OPEN) Hi. Hi. (NOA GRUNTS SOFTLY) Do you need anything? No. Thank you. Okay. What does it taste like? Well... It depends on where it comes from and how it's prepared. But... if it's done right... it's fucking exquisite. It's like nothing you've ever had before. NOA: Hmm. That's it? (CHUCKLES WRYLY) (DOOR SLIDES CLOSE) (LOCK CLICKS) ANN: Go up to the playroom while I make dinner, okay? ANN'S SON: Yeah! I got here first! Listen, um... I'm not even positive that's my husband in the picture. You can't really see the face. Plus I saw him this morning before he went to work, so... -Here. -Thanks. Honestly, this is... This is crazy. You should go to the police if you're so worried about your friend. (CHUCKLES) Um... Does he ever go out of town -for work or anything? -No. Well, they went away to Cottage Grove, like, a week ago, and I haven't heard from her since then and I'm just... I don't know where that is. -I'm just worried, okay? -Yeah, I understand. I'm really sorry. -Um... -(DOOR OPENS) That's my husband right now. You need to leave, okay? I'm just desperate. Woman-to-woman, maybe your husband has more information. I'm not trying to mess anything up for anybody here. I'm just trying to find my friend. MAN: Hey. ANN: Hey. -Hello. Hi. -Hey. (KEYS CLATTER) -What's going on? -ANN: Nothing. Nothing. This woman was just leaving. You're Steve, right? No, I'm Brendan. But you go by Steve, right? No. Just Brendan. Who are you? I'm Mollie. Um... My friend Noa, uh, I think you know her, she's missing. Noa. Um... (EXHALES SHARPLY) No, I'm sorry, I... I don't. Um... -Do you, honey? -No, of course not. That's terrible. Yeah, I don't know, I think you have the wrong house. Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right. Okay. -I'm sorry. Sorry about that. -No. We're sorry we couldn't help you. Sorry about your friend. I'm just thinking, when's the last time you saw her? (THANK YOU FOR BEING A FRIEND RINGTONE PLAYING) Oh, it's you. (CHUCKLES) Mollie, right? Really shouldn't have done that. (BLOW LANDS) (THANK YOU FOR BEING A FRIEND CONTINUES PLAYING) STEVE: Noa said we'd get along. Fuck! Let's see. (GRUNTS) STEVE: So... why did you ask me what it tasted like? Um... (GRUNTS) I don't know. I guess I was... curious. STEVE: You were curious? You expect me to believe that? You can believe what you want. Okay. Let's have dinner and we'll see how curious you are. Brought you some stuff. Figured you might wanna... change. (LOCK CLICKS) (SIGHS) (UPBEAT HIP-HOP SONG PLAYING) PAUL: Mmm. (GRUNTING) Fuck. (SCREENSHOT CLICKS) (UNEASY MUSIC PLAYING) -(WATER RUNNING) -The boys go down okay? Mmm-hmm. They asked for you. (STEVE SIGHS) How was work? Good. Actually, I'm gonna be late tomorrow night. Lots to do now with the new product. Got some big clients expecting deliveries. I'm gonna take a shower. Good teamwork today. -(TAP CREAKS) -(WATER RUNNING) (MELANCHOLIC SONG PLAYING) (MELANCHOLIC SONG CONTINUES OVER EARPHONES) (SLICING) (NEW AGE MUSIC PLAYING) (CART RATTLING) (MUSIC CONTINUES) (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) (CHAINSAW WHIRRING) (POPS) STEVE: Don't worry, I'm not gonna drug you. Again. You better not. Cheers. Cheers. STEVE: So you mentioned you were curious. Yeah. All right, what do you wanna know? Well... Um... When did you first try it? -(DISHES CLATTERING) -STEVE: Um... I was, um, 18 or 19. Nineteen, yeah. And, look... it wasn't an overnight thing, you know? First I was actually horrified. I mean, how could I possibly be capable of doing something like this? You know, I was a normal kid, I had friends, I had a normal life, and now I gotta deal with this thing that I couldn't share with anybody. And that killed me. But I couldn't stop thinking about it. I couldn't get the, um, taste out of my mouth. The texture. I liked it. I liked the way it made me feel. So I thought, "I gotta find out "if there's more out there," you know. "I can't possibly be the only person "that feels this way." And I wasn't. There's a whole community of people that are devoted to this. And that's when my life started making sense. I mean, it's... It's a very powerful thing. This whole world, if you only knew. It's, um... It's about giving. Giving yourself over to somebody. Becoming one with somebody else, forever. And that's... That's a beautiful thing. That's surrender. That's love. -(STEVE INHALES SHARPLY) -(DISHES CLATTER) And how many people are in this community? STEVE: Not many. The 1% of the 1%. You know, there's nothing these people can't afford, right? They want the one thing that no one else has or can get. And that's where I come in. I can get it for them. I made a name for myself. Is it only women that you eat? STEVE: Yeah. Why? That's where the market is. Plus, women just taste better. (UTENSILS CLATTER) So... I cooked us something. If you're open to trying it. Is it... Is it me? No. We'll have a bite together. (FORK CLATTER ECHOES) (GULPS) (HEARTBEAT POUNDING RHYTHMICALLY) (INDISTINCT GROWL) (SQUELCHES) (SCRAPING) (HEARTBEAT INCREASING) STEVE: This meal is about $30,000. That's crazy. Be a lot more if she was still alive. Hope. That was her name. Kinda funny. (CHUCKLES) It's kinda funny. Stupid. It's not what I expected. It's, um... It's indescribable. (NOA CHUCKLES SOFTLY) (LOCK CLICKS, DOOR SLIDES OPEN) Thank you, Steve. You're welcome, Noa. (CLICKS TONGUE) You know how I knew you were special? 'Cause you're fucked up, too. (LOCK CLICKS) (SIGHS) (KEYS JINGLING) (BEEPS) (SIGHS) STEVE: All right. Let's go. (MOLLIE GROANING WEAKLY) (GRUNTING WEAKLY) (NOA RETCHING) (COUGHS, SPITS) (PANTING) (RETCHING) (PANTING) PENNY: Noa! NOA: Penny. Yeah? PENNY: That definitely didn't sound like Melissa. Yeah. Sounds like someone new. (GROANS WEAKLY) (EKG MACHINE BEEPING STEADILY) PENNY: You know, the other night, I was thinking about how nice it's been to talk to you. But then I was like, what if you're not real... ...and I'm just going crazy? (CHUCKLES) Like Melissa. But I feel like if I had an imaginary friend, I wouldn't name her Noa. It'd be, like... Sean Connery. (BOTH LAUGHING) I wish I could see you. PENNY: Me, too. (BEEPS) STEVE: I have something for you. Go ahead. Open it. Do you like it? (CLICKS TONGUE) It's pink. I love it. (CHUCKLES) Thank you. Maybe you can wear it tonight and, uh, we can have dinner again. Yeah. Okay. I'll pick you up at 7:00. I have no idea what time it is. I know. Sure. Maybe you can freshen up. -(DOOR LOCK CLICKS) -(MELANCHOLIC MUSIC PLAYING) (FOOTSTEPS RECEDING) (SPRITZING) (DOOR BEEPS) Well, hello. STEVE: Hi. NOA: I see we've made it to the dinner table. Yes, we have. NOA: Is, um...? Is this a date, Steve? Maybe it is. (ROMANTIC SONG PLAYING ON SPEAKER) (NOA BREATHES DEEPLY) (STEVE CHUCKLES) -Ooh. -Well... All right. It's gonna be an interesting night. Yeah. It is. -(CHUCKLES) -Great. Let's get drunk. I was thinking about what you said that night. About growing up alone and all. Made me realize nobody's ever really cooked for you. And that made me sad. Everyone has to have someone cook for them once. Pâté. -(MUNCHING) -Liver. And garlic and rosemary. (NOA CHUCKLES) -Mmm. -Mmm. I do taste the garlic. Definitely. Whoa. You can make it next time. Just the way you like it. (CHUCKLES) Who's this? -This? -Mmm. This is Melissa. Melissa. (CHUCKLES) I mean, that's so boring. Isn't it? (CHUCKLES) Like, she... She tastes so, you know, decadent... and her name's Melissa. (CHUCKLES) Well... Thought you were gonna say something, you know, like: Joy. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Guess we finished all of Hope. Oh, no, there's more Hope left. (LAUGHS) Did Melissa ever get a candlelit dinner? (CHAIR SLIDES BACKWARD) (SWITCH BEEPS) STEVE: Welcome to my world. The clients wanna feel closer to the women. They become a part of you in some way. There's Melissa. And no, she never had a candlelight dinner. Where is my stuff? (STEVE EXHALES DEEPLY) (CLICKS TONGUE) (SOFTLY) With me, I guess. All right, come on. There's more to eat. STEVE: (ECHOING) We never did make it to Cottage Grove, did we? That's too bad. (DISHES CLATTERING) It's really serene out there. Really makes me wanna hug a tree. (LAUGHS) Anyway, who knows? Maybe we could still go. Okay, so this is, uh, breast meat. And it's, um, it's really nice. It's fatty and subtle. I don't know. It might even be familiar. (LAUGHING) What? -No, it's... -Is it--? No, it's, uh... It's just stupid. (CHUCKLES) -No, no, no, go ahead. -No, I can't. Come on. You gotta tell me. No, it's just, um... You saved the breast till last. (BOTH LAUGHING) Oh, my God. That was, um... That's good. This is really nice, Steve. You know? You're right, no one has ever cooked for me, so... It's not quite how I pictured it, but, you know, it's... It is nice. Yeah. She's got better tits than me. (LAUGHS) You're not disagreeing? -(LAUGHING) No, it's not-- -Thanks, Steve. -I wasn't saying that. -Thanks a lot, Steve. (LAUGHING) STEVE: What's--? -Um... -(NOA LAUGHS) (NOA SOBBING) (SOFTLY) Sorry. Sorry, it's just... Um, it's just... (SNIFFLES) It is really nice. And it's... It's... all just so confusing. And I can't quite process... (CONTINUES SOBBING) ...'cause I feel awful. I feel... awful. 'Cause... 'Cause I don't... I don't feel awful. Fuck. (SOFTLY) Hey, come here. Noa. Hey. It's okay. -It's okay. -(CONTINUES SOBBING) (KISSES) It's all gonna be okay. You're just different. And I knew it from the moment I met you. (STEVE BREATHES DEEPLY) (STEVE CHUCKLES) I forgot to handcuff you. Yeah. (CHUCKLES, SNIFFLES) You did. Do you wanna dance? Yeah. (ROMANTIC SONG PLAYING) Yeah, I do. (SPANISH ROMANTIC SONG PLAYING) (DOOR OPENS) Fuck! (BOTH SCREAMING) -(CONTINUES SCREAMING) -(NOA PANTING) You fuck! (STEVE GROANS) Oh, God! (GROANING IN AGONY) Come on, come on.

I can't tell you right now, but I will. Put those on. I'll be right back! MOLLIE: Where are you going? (GRUNTS, GROANS) Penny? Oh, my God, Penny! Are you okay? It's so good to finally see you.

(PANTING) (MOLLIE GRUNTS) MOLLIE: We gotta get the fuck outta here. (WOMEN PANTING, GROANING) -Fuck. -(PHONE CLATTERS) (REGGAE MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR STEREO) Naw, son, this shit is creepy as fuck.
