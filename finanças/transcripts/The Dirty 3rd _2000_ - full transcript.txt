- [Street] You want talk about a heated situation? Here's the story, I never woulda thought were to end like this. I remember when I first met this fool, Nahim Action, little did I know, it'd be a friendship that would last a lifetime. - You ain't gonna be nothing but a whore ass nigga.

Lil C, see, grew up in this crazy ass family. When the average kid was probably still tryna play pop one in football, Lil C was already in the streets hustling. People on the streets say that, when crack first came on the bus from LA, that Lil C was sitting on that same bus, probably in the same seat. After high school, Reaganomics kicked in, everything got fucked up. Everything, and everybody got affected by crack, some form of fashion. The kids, shit, we was selling it, and the parents, (chuckles) they was buying it. Like I said, shit was fucked up. And when shit get crazy, the only thing a real nigga can do, is get crazy with it. - Hey man, I sure hoped to see you around here, dawg. - Me too, man, I sure could use me a hit, dawg. - C what's up dawg? - See me show my motherfuckin' ass around this bitch, I'm tellin' you. - Man, I ain't got no money, you got some money? - You ain't got no money? - Shit, shit. - I be on the block all day, I'm tellin' you. - Lockin' it up, I hope huh? - Yeah, yeah. - Shit. - Nah, fool, I told you I ain't got no money. - They go, look at these motherfuckers, here they go. - Fool, you about to sing the song, damn. - Sing what, motherfucker?

I'm about to change our life. (Lil C and man speak indistinctly) - You know what I'm saying? - You all right? - Yo, let's see, man, I need a wholesale. - Shit, I got that for you, baby. Look where the money at? And we finna sold this motherfucking block up, I'm telling you, here, you ready? - That's all up. - You see it, let's go. Shit, we finna sold this motherfucking... - [Street] Dorcia put us down in the game, and it was on and popping. - About to do this baby. - [Street] I was in college during those days, but you never woulda guessed it.

And if you don't know, that's all two kilos of crack cocaine, a whole lot of motherfucking trap. - Just get down here man. - You're not gonna sell drugs in this neighborhood, we're cleaning this place out. - Man, fuck you. - [Street] My boy had got burned, and a lesson was learned, but that was then, and this is now. And for those of you didn't catch on, my name is Street. Welcome to the Dirty Third. (Carlos and Street speaking in foreign language) - [Action] Yeah bruh, I fucked the shit out that whore, you dig?
